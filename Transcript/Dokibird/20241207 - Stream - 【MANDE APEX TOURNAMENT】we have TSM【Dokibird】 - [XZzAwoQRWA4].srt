1
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,800
Is this game on?

2
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,600
Hello everybody!

3
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,120
Hello, hello!

4
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,660
Alright, so they're doing a briefing right now, so we're just listening to the briefing at the moment.

5
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,440
If you guys are like, wondering what the fuck is going on...

6
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,780
Oh, uh, for the map, it's Stormpoint.

7
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,500
So we're just, we're just getting briefed on what we have to do and what we...

8
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,420
What the fuck?

9
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,780
Oh, my bad, I thought I was muted.

10
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,140
I just need you guys to know, this custom, I feel really bad for the organizers, because like...

11
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,220
My teammates, other than Short4, my teammates changed like...

12
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,760
Uh, three to four times.

13
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,040
So like, um, I was supposed to have Wots...

14
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,140
I was supposed to have Sweet, then I was going to have Wotsy...

15
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,400
Then I was going to have Repz...

16
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
Then I was going to have Enemy...

17
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,720
And then finally I have Vermont, and I found that out this morning.

18
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,300
This is our host.

19
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,160
Oh, it's Clump.

20
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,740
Is he still talking?

21
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,700
He's still going, yeah.

22
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,720
I think he's still talking.

23
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,820
Wait, really?

24
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,780
I agree, Mandy.

25
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,060
No, yes, Mandy, I agree.

26
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,140
Oh, wait, then Mandy, like, deafened himself?

27
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,060
Really good, yep.

28
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,120
Mandy, that's... yeah, that works.

29
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,420
This is really important information.

30
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,800
I hope you're all writing this down.

31
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,100
No, hold on, Zero, you have to let Mandy speak.

32
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,960
Did he just mute his corner?

33
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,820
Yeah, so like, yesterday I thought I was going to have Repz...

34
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,520
Guys, guys, please let Mandy speak.

35
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,740
And then I woke up, and then the organizer was like, Teehee, JK, we're going to be playing with Enemy.

36
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,060
And I was like, cool!

37
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,060
Cool, is Enemy going to be my pro?

38
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,720
And then literally, like, three hours before the custom was supposed to start, he was like, Teehee, JK again!

39
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,700
It's the host!

40
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,820
And I was like, oh, okay.

41
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,040
What is Twitch?

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,640
People have already, he's not even reading it.

43
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,060
So I'm just like...

44
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,400
They're like debriefing.

45
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,960
While they're debriefing, you guys are going to listen to this debrief while I make my waiting room for my other lobby.

46
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,040
Mandy, you've been muted for like five minutes.

47
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,180
Wait, he's still muted.

48
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,700
Sound ports are so bad.

49
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,880
I didn't disable it, but...

50
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,080
Wait, why does it say that girl is talking, but I hear Mandy's voice?

51
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,660
Because it's coming through girls.

52
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,120
Oh, you can hear him through my face?

53
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,520
Oh, you're locked up.

54
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,740
Wait, that's like she was trying to profit right now.

55
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,040
Hold on.

56
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,020
Are you actually Mandy?

57
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,060
Rig the games for us, bro.

58
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,060
Oh, true.

59
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,780
I'm not.

60
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,540
He's not.

61
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,660
You've been muted on Discord.

62
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,360
He's literally deafened.

63
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,740
You're deafened.

64
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,040
I'm muted now.

65
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,480
No, you've been muted ever since.

66
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:16,940
I'm not muted.

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,060
This guy is a Zoomer.

68
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,720
We can't hear that at all.

69
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,340
What the fuck is going on?

70
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,680
Discord doesn't use Discord.

71
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,760
They can't hear you?

72
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,720
What are you talking about?

73
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,660
Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

74
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:34,780
Goodbye.

75
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,980
It's cocked.

76
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,260
Good games, good games.

77
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,360
What's happening right now?

78
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,520
Well, like they're having issues with...

79
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,560
Manny is like muted right now.

80
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,440
We hear you.

81
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,060
Oh, damn.

82
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,900
He hates us then.

83
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
He's not talking.

84
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,740
His mic is broke, bro.

85
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,760
Why is it going green but we can't fucking hear anything?

86
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,320
What's going on?

87
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,940
I don't see it going green.

88
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
It's going well so far.

89
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,100
It's going...

90
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,100
It's going pretty well so far.

91
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,460
Now we can hear you, I think.

92
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,220
Yeah,

93
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,800
he went on like a soliloquy and we didn't hear like 10 minutes of it.

94
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,420
I think I'm ready to play.

95
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,100
We don't need this.

96
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,060
We know the rules for game one.

97
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,080
Yeah, we know the rules.

98
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:35,860
Alright.

99
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,660
Alright, do we have code out?

100
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,240
Is code out?

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,640
Do we leave?

102
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,900
No, doesn't seem like it.

103
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,700
I don't think so.

104
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,800
Yeah, code's coming in in a sec.

105
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,220
I can start... keep working.

106
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,780
Okay, the waiting room is here.

107
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,120
Wait, can you guys hear my game?

108
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,440
It's time to check out the fan... the Dragoon fan game.

109
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,960
Multitask time.

110
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,540
Lessons we brought up.

111
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,500
And there's a ton of people.

112
00:05:59,520 --> 00:05:59,940
Okay, sure.

113
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,400
No problem.

114
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,520
Can we like chill and wait for him to figure out if he can talk or are we going to our channel?

115
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,360
Honestly, just hit the... just hit the... oh, wait.

116
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:10,940
Oh.

117
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:12,960
Wait.

118
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay.

119
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,960
He's cooked.

120
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,580
He's cooked.

121
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,060
He's cooked.

122
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,880
He's cooked.

123
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,280
He's cooked.

124
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,660
Everyone just go to the service.

125
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,220
It's cooked.

126
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,940
I'm going to my channel, bro.

127
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,460
Alright, bye everybody.

128
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,560
Great talk.

129
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,420
There's a code out.

130
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,000
We're off to a good start.

131
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,560
Yeah, I think... you know what?

132
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,660
That might be the only, you know, bad thing that happens today.

133
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,900
Everything else would go... everything else would be like, you know, would go okay after that.

134
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,500
I don't believe you.

135
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,660
Why?

136
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,780
It's not about believing in me.

137
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,480
It's about believing in the organizers.

138
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,080
Okay, but like it's not about believing in me.

139
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,760
It's about believing in the organizers.

140
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,000
Do you not believe in the organizers?

141
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,820
The leader is the only one I know.

142
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,240
I'm not even the team leader.

143
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,680
We're all randomized together.

144
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
There's no team leaders in this.

145
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,420
This is random royale.

146
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay, why is the team name Code Doki?

147
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,400
Because you were like... you picked the team name.

148
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,580
So I was like, alright, I'm shilling my gamer subs code.

149
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,480
Guys, okay, do you know... wait, are you streaming Surefour?

150
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:17,720
Yeah.

151
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,480
Oh, okay.

152
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:26,980
Surefour chat, do you know that I have a gamer subs code where you can use my code DokiBerry for 10% off on any order?

153
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,280
Have you looked at my chat enough to realize they're all just gonna spam no?

154
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,980
No, they won't.

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
No, they won't.

156
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,800
Because I'm anime.

157
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,920
You got a Dice of Cringe, you got a no.

158
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,600
Guys, are you really gonna listen to Surefour?

159
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,640
No, they don't listen.

160
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,840
They listen to themselves.

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,600
Are you really gonna listen to Surefour and let him tell you what to do and what not to do?

162
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,120
Look at that, I see... I will buy some right now.

163
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,220
And you're like, fuck Surefour.

164
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,700
I see your chat and they're like, yeah.

165
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,780
It's like one person.

166
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,980
You're cherry picking.

167
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,120
No, I'm not.

168
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,960
You're cherry picking.

169
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,800
I saw at least two people.

170
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,980
I saw at least two of them.

171
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,780
Oh, the gamer code is up.

172
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,260
How do I copy it?

173
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,560
Why is my Discord broken?

174
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,720
Okay, let me fix this real fast.

175
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,700
Oh no, fix yourself now.

176
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,480
Can I copy it because I don't have permission to send messages in the chat?

177
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,220
Wait, what?

178
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:25,960
No, you can't.

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,220
I literally just copied it.

180
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,100
Dude, it's not letting me.

181
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,040
Okay, the first letter is P.

182
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,280
What's our... where are we?

183
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,120
We have a leak, bro.

184
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,800
Oh, the first letter.

185
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,400
There's like freaking 10 numbers in there.

186
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,860
Okay, that makes the statistics go wrong.

187
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,340
Alright, the last number is 7.

188
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,280
Do I have to hide my screen?

189
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,000
Good luck, everyone.

190
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,940
No, it's asterisks.

191
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,220
Okay, if it gets leaked, it's your fault.

192
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,920
I literally did it on stream.

193
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,280
Wait, it's Stormpoint, right?

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,140
For the hide and seek map?

195
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,360
It's a map.

196
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,700
Alright, you guys know the hiding spots for Stormpoint?

197
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,200
You're talking a first place here.

198
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,620
You got first?

199
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,120
On the very first...

200
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,700
I think it was disguised host.

201
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,220
No, my team was first in the very first disguised host.

202
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,480
First round, I got first.

203
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,020
Oh, the first round.

204
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:26,700
Okay.

205
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,520
Yeah, I was like, I remember I got first place on that.

206
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,640
Oh, so this is basically winner's POV.

207
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,440
Virus is in here.

208
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,420
Wait, my name's still Ice King.

209
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,320
I'm not changing it.

210
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,220
You got some phlegm there?

211
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,920
Alright, I'm gonna...

212
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,900
I wanna be Pathfinder.

213
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,300
I just hope you're okay.

214
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,180
I'll be fine.

215
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,860
Let's see, am I missing...

216
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,620
Oh yeah, I was gonna finish my work tweet.

217
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,880
Work tweet?

218
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,580
Yeah, I need to tweet out my waiting room for my stream after this.

219
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,660
That's in like, a different time.

220
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,440
Yeah, but I still need to tweet out the waiting room.

221
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,580
Alright, done.

222
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,820
Oh no, is this the right...

223
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,540
I'm pretty sure Dyrus is just gonna look for you to grief you, by the way.

224
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,680
But he doesn't even know what I'm playing as.

225
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,620
It doesn't matter, he'll stream snipe.

226
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,540
He's gonna stream snipe just so I can...

227
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,600
This is like, three years.

228
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,600
He waited three years for this.

229
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,540
It's something he would do.

230
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,340
What's the team that's... Who are the Seekers?

231
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,440
The Gamersubs team, so Sov's team.

232
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,520
Oh, Sov's the Seekers?

233
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,100
Yeah, like all the Zz's.

234
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,460
That means we gotta rely on luck on the last zone.

235
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,220
We literally have to rely on last zone to see who fucking lives.

236
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,600
Do we know we're team Doki... Wait, is this Dyrus?

237
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,480
Is superidiot5000 Dyrus's team?

238
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,700
We're superidiot5000.

239
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,460
I think that's Dyrus.

240
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,980
Yeah, because he's with Fun.

241
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,960
I don't even see superidiot5000 in the team names.

242
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,360
Oh my god, is that actually him?

243
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,540
It's with FunFPS.

244
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,740
Oh yeah, that's probably him.

245
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,180
I guess we don't have designated landing spots, so we can literally land anywhere we want.

246
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,080
Yeah, we just rip it.

247
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,880
It's just all separate.

248
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,160
What's the strategy, guys?

249
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,100
Surefour, lead us to victory here.

250
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,240
Oh yeah, Surefour, since you've won that game.

251
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,060
I mean, we need an AUK team for griefing.

252
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,700
You need Horizon for getting juicy highgrounds.

253
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,580
You could go Pathfinder for more juicy highgrounds.

254
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,980
Yeah, I claim Pathfinder.

255
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,440
I have a feeling the zone is gonna go all the way to endgame.

256
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,160
No, 100%.

257
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,460
I mean, with the secret team?

258
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,140
It does.

259
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,000
They're definitely not gonna kill everybody.

260
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,080
I mean, they're not allowed to use scans either, so...

261
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,840
And also, who the fuck is Willy on their team?

262
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,340
Whoa, bro, whoa.

263
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,740
I'm just asking a question.

264
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,440
Who's Willy?

265
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,340
That's Ellie, bro.

266
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,740
Oh, is that Ellie?

267
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,600
That's a VTuber, bro.

268
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,760
You're fucked up.

269
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,500
Willy is Ellie?

270
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:50,720
No, it's not.

271
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,640
Oh, you're looking at...

272
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,140
I'm looking at team 20.

273
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,900
Yeah, I was like, who the fuck is Willy?

274
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,980
Dude, the last thing you were talking about was Dyrus, super idiot 5000, fun FPS, okay?

275
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,320
I was like, there's a Willy in there.

276
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:02,840
I was like, no.

277
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,800
Ellie is literally called Ellie.

278
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:05,980
I don't know.

279
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,780
Why don't you type in chat, who are you, Willy?

280
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,020
I think they're all, like, actual gamer subs, people.

281
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,220
Yeah, probably.

282
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,880
Oh, so we are gonna make it to end zone.

283
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,760
Dude, you guys are toxic.

284
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,400
It might end up being, like, a heal-off.

285
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,980
I think it's literally gonna be a heal-off at the end of the game.

286
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,600
Yeah, like, I legitimately don't think...

287
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,860
And if they don't play ballistic, they're gonna run out of ammo before...

288
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,080
Listen, the only way we win a heal-off, one of us has to be a support character.

289
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,880
Because support characters get double heal from syringes.

290
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,060
Mmm...

291
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,680
Alright, Surefour.

292
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,620
I don't want to pick one of the team and play Loba.

293
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,260
I think Loba would be the best one to play.

294
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,200
Alright, Surefour, it's time for your heal-slut arc.

295
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,980
Like you said, he'll take one for the team.

296
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,160
Oh, you're gonna take it for the team?

297
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Oh, so you're gonna be our heal-slut.

298
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,890
Come on, let it out.

299
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,610
Yeah, let it out.

300
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,250
Say it.

301
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,370
Don't let her bully you.

302
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,710
The person that plays Loba is like, time a syringe.

303
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:12,890
Alright,

304
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,630
so what are we playing?

305
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:19,750
I'm Horizon.

306
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:24,770
You're Horizon, I'm Pathfinder, and then Verhulst is our little Loba.

307
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,910
Are we trying to like, stay together?

308
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,150
I thought we were splitting up.

309
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,490
We're about to be across the map.

310
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,510
I'm pretty sure it's...

311
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:41,190
We can stay in the vicinity to craft armors and stuff, but like, when we get into the thick of it, just hide.

312
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,510
It's every man for himself.

313
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,710
Yeah, I feel like this is like...

314
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,390
I guarantee they're not gonna be able to kill anybody.

315
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,850
If everyone's on Pathfinder and Loba, they're not killing anybody.

316
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,970
They're not gonna actually kill anybody.

317
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,730
Oh my god, you have zero confidence on these guys.

318
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,070
I really don't think they're gonna kill anybody.

319
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,930
What if you're gonna be the first person to die to them?

320
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,570
What happens if you're the first person to die to them?

321
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,170
Are you gonna retire from Apex?

322
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,370
I'm not playing the rest of the tournament.

323
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,510
You're just gonna leave?

324
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:09,750
Oh no!

325
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,910
He's not even gonna come back for BLGS, guys.

326
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:15,950
He's literally just gonna...

327
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,090
He's just gonna disappear off the face of the earth.

328
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,170
I'm just gonna retire.

329
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,170
Why isn't Manday one of the seekers, bro?

330
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,450
No, he's just casting.

331
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,150
He's just watching us like a...

332
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,050
We're like little rats to him.

333
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,830
I legitimately thought Manday was gonna be in the Gamersubs team.

334
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,850
Because this entire tournament is based off of Gamersubs.

335
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,690
They might need it.

336
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,470
Honestly, I was surprised.

337
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,490
I was surprised it's like...

338
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,950
An actual full team of Gamersubs people and Sov.

339
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,110
Wait, where are they gonna land, though?

340
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,050
Where...

341
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,190
Where are seekers landing?

342
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,650
I think they'll probably go to the edge and give us a little bit of time or some shit.

343
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,550
Yeah, that's true.

344
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,310
Pretty sad one of us just got landed on.

345
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,390
It's 3pm somewhere in this world.

346
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,310
What are we missing?

347
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,670
We're missing like three people.

348
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,700
The seekers are splitting up.

349
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,280
Good luck.

350
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,920
Oh, we're splitting up?

351
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,720
No, they're splitting up.

352
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,220
I don't even have zero chance of killing anybody.

353
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,060
Oh!

354
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,540
Not even a last chance.

355
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,560
Oh, yeah, that's true.

356
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,060
That's one.

357
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,500
Yeah, we don't know how their aim is.

358
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,560
Wait, if they're not Apex players, then like...

359
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,880
Like, do you think they can even hit us?

360
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,740
We're about to find out.

361
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,080
It doesn't matter whether they can hit us.

362
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,800
Like, they're not chasing a pro Pathfinder.

363
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,340
Yeah.

364
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,180
I'm just like, would anybody be able to hit the pro players?

365
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,300
Any pro player that's on Lobo or Pathfinder or Octane, they are not getting chased down.

366
00:16:59,440 --> 00:16:59,840
They're gonna be...

367
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,760
Oh my god.

368
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,900
That's fucked.

369
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,920
I just realized I was using the wrong overlay.

370
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,020
But yeah, that's fucked.

371
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,080
What are you guys playing?

372
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,060
When he's on Pathfinder?

373
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,060
I'm on Pathy.

374
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:09,820
Okay.

375
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,400
What are you unsure for?

376
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,240
Horizon.

377
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,200
Yeah.

378
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,880
What's the Horizon thought process?

379
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,260
You going for like a high spot somewhere?

380
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:17,960
Yeah.

381
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:19,880
Interesting.

382
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:28,160
I'm looking for a tall mountain with a tiny rock sticking out of it with a tree slightly brushing over it and then hiding there.

383
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,180
Should I just go...

384
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,820
Should I go under the map?

385
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,740
It's like a bug on Lobo.

386
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,960
Oh my god.

387
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,140
Wait, they don't have rules against us.

388
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,060
Yeah, do that.

389
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,980
I'm pretty sure they do have rules.

390
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,460
No, they don't.

391
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:36,880
No.

392
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,840
I read the rules.

393
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,480
I read the rules.

394
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,320
They have no rules against it.

395
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,460
You should do it.

396
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,420
I don't think it's gonna matter because if you're not right where the zone ends, I don't think it's gonna matter.

397
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:49,760
Oh, wait.

398
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,820
You can't leave, right?

399
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,480
When you're under?

400
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,760
I don't think so.

401
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,680
Oh.

402
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,320
Maybe, yeah.

403
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,120
Maybe you shouldn't.

404
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,280
Don't worry.

405
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,860
I brought it up to the admins.

406
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,860
Wait, you snitched on us?

407
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,980
I can't believe it.

408
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,260
I can't believe it.

409
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,680
Surefour is a fucking snitch.

410
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,120
No, I only snitched on you.

411
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,240
I can't.

412
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,680
I only snitched on you.

413
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,400
We're a team!

414
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,680
It's hide and seek.

415
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,560
It's every man for himself.

416
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,840
Yeah, but it's a team game.

417
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
If we win, we get money together.

418
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,780
Nah, because if you guys die, then that goes away and it's only to me.

419
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,060
No, it isn't.

420
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,980
We all get it.

421
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,920
Are you kidding me?

422
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,420
What?

423
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,360
Okay, I need to fix my overview.

424
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:35,940
Two seconds.

425
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,380
Wait, are we starting?

426
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,080
I'm tapped out.

427
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:38,700
Two seconds.

428
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,780
Wait, they're missing one.

429
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,720
Who is...

430
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,100
Oh, team five starts.

431
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,740
No, they're not.

432
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,500
They were about to, and then someone was missing.

433
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,520
No, they're not.

434
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,900
You can't...

435
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,940
If you wanted secret...

436
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,200
Wait, what?

437
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,580
Can we get...

438
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,800
His keyboard got muted this time.

439
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,300
Can we be secret?

440
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,020
What does he mean with, if you wanted secret?

441
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,580
We'll never know.

442
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,380
We'll never know.

443
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,300
We'll never know what he meant by that.

444
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,350
Will we ever get to start the game?

445
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,410
Let's find out.

446
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,170
Sorry, I got the winter throat disease right now.

447
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,950
Oh no, that's the worst type of disease.

448
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,770
It's not too bad.

449
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,110
No, it's the worst type.

450
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,870
I meant when he's like coughing.

451
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,050
I guess, yeah.

452
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,510
I mean, as long as you like mute yourself.

453
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,490
No, I was trying to say to him like, it's okay that he's coughed on mic.

454
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,470
It's not that bad.

455
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,070
Just trying to comfort him.

456
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,170
Oh, I wasn't.

457
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:04,670
Well, yeah.

458
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,430
I'm trying to mute it, but sometimes the winter throat disease just slips out.

459
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,130
Yep.

460
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,110
We just can't contain it.

461
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,450
Yeah, you gotta let it out.

462
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,430
You gotta let it out or you'll have too much inside you and then you'll combust.

463
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,070
Yep.

464
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,630
I can't be combusted mid-game?

465
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:23,950
Nope.

466
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:30,230
I like how they're like, if you could put GamerSupps x Mandy and then use code Mandy, by the way.

467
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,930
Guys, use code DokiBird.

468
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,150
I also have a GamerSupps code too.

469
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,110
Don't use that.

470
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,610
And you get like...

471
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:38,970
Why not?

472
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,510
Don't use that.

473
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,330
Why not?

474
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,330
How do you use code DokiBird?

475
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,490
So you go to...

476
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,550
Okay, so it's very easy.

477
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,480
You go to GamerSupps.com and then from there...

478
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:52,830
Oh, wait.

479
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:53,090
No, sorry.

480
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,110
GamerSupps.gg.

481
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,770
And then you pick...

482
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,350
Oh, by the way, I also have merchandise at GamerSupps.

483
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,090
So you can actually look at my collection.

484
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,230
Oh, wait.

485
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:02,490
Sorry.

486
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,090
It just got off the market.

487
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,520
It literally ended today.

488
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,670
But there's other really cool things on the website.

489
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:15,450
So you see all those cool cups over there.

490
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:15,830
Skip.

491
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,270
Skip ad.

492
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,010
YouTube skip.

493
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:22,370
And then you can also see these jugs where you can get some cool GamerSupps flavors.

494
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,290
And then after that, you go look at the code.

495
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,750
I pressed the skip ad button.

496
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:28,330
Skip.

497
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,530
And then you put the code DokiBird on there.

498
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,070
Skip ad.

499
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,810
You get 10% off on all your orders.

500
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:34,770
Skip.

501
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,910
Skip.

502
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,630
But yeah, use code DokiBird if you want 10% off on all your GamerSupp orders.

503
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,190
I'm drinking GamerSupps right now.

504
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,250
And I say that it's really good.

505
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,530
Are you gonna buy GamerSupps stuff now, Surefour?

506
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,170
Skip.

507
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,990
I'm drinking a fucking C4 right now.

508
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,830
A C4?

509
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,950
What the fuck is a C4?

510
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,070
Whoa, conflict of interest.

511
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,410
What's a C4?

512
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,470
It's a pre-workout energy drink.

513
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,610
Oh shit.

514
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,270
Is it good?

515
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,350
Does it even taste good?

516
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:09,590
Yeah.

517
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,810
What flavor do you have?

518
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,370
Zero sugar.

519
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:13,530
Starburst.

520
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,150
Cherry.

521
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,710
Starburst?

522
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:15,650
Whoa.

523
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,470
It's got 200mg of caffeine.

524
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,210
Okay, that sounds like a lot of caffeine.

525
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,630
I'm about to explode like a C4 charge right now.

526
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,570
Yeah, is that why it's called C4?

527
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:28,170
I'm literally fucking busting with energy right now.

528
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,730
I can't wait.

529
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,190
You're gonna have so much energy for fucking hide and seek.

530
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,370
Oh yeah, I'm motivated.

531
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,360
Oh my god, it's been 24 minutes.

532
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,480
It's been 24 minutes, please!

533
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,220
You signed up for this.

534
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,360
You signed up for it too!

535
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,040
Yeah.

536
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,480
And I guess Verhulst got peer pressured by Mandy.

537
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,160
You got peer pressured?

538
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:00,660
Oh.

539
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,080
No, I volunteered.

540
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,380
Oh, you volunteered?

541
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,320
Yeah.

542
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,700
There goes Doki lying again.

543
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,400
Oh, I said I bet.

544
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,880
I didn't say like I know for sure.

545
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,660
I gotta make sure I'm picking Pathfinder because...

546
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,640
Alright.

547
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,140
Ice King.

548
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,340
Where the fuck is he?

549
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,420
You're the wrong teammate on our team.

550
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,920
No, that's me.

551
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,700
Why are you Ice King?

552
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,580
Because he's the Ice King.

553
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,860
That's his side job.

554
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,400
It's PGA lore.

555
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:30,920
PGA?

556
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,120
PGA.

557
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,680
PGA Tour Golf?

558
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:33,540
Yeah.

559
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,390
I made a guy that was dripped out.

560
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,730
Called him the Ice King.

561
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,930
Proceeded to shit on all my friends.

562
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:44,870
Ooh.

563
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:45,570
Ooh.

564
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,510
Ice King, King of the Green.

565
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:52,290
Alright, so they're landing at a random spot.

566
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,750
So I guess...

567
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,430
Alright, where do we drop and drop lead?

568
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,150
Do we drop with each other or do we all leave each other to die?

569
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,730
We probably drop with each other at the start.

570
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,410
I think we can stay relatively close.

571
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,490
We don't have to stay on top of each other.

572
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,670
We should be relatively close.

573
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,750
Okay, I don't want to meet Jumpmaster.

574
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,630
Bro, you fucking relinquished it so late.

575
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,910
What's your fucking deal?

576
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,050
I didn't realize I was in my settings.

577
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,090
What is your deal?

578
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,550
I was in my settings.

579
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,450
I didn't know.

580
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:24,910
I'm gonna land here then.

581
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,390
This is a great spot.

582
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,950
Alright, let's see who dies first.

583
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,670
Yeah, just be wary of landing next to anybody.

584
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,590
You don't know who's the seeker.

585
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:36,710
Well, this person looks like it's a solo flying on me.

586
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,430
I mean, the seekers were all going to be split up though, right?

587
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,130
Yeah.

588
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,570
I feel like a lot of hiders are splitting up too.

589
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:46,830
I think we're good.

590
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:47,730
I'm taking a gable.

591
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:58,350
Wish somebody should pick up the yellow thingies.

592
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,570
Oh, ult excels?

593
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,470
They said I'm allowed to use horizon ult.

594
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,730
Yeah, as long as it's non-damaging.

595
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,410
Someone's in my building.

596
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,130
If you punch them, they'll never know.

597
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,630
Do not use names.

598
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:20,190
All I'm saying is if you punch them, they won't know who did it.

599
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:20,910
That's the thing.

600
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,070
I think they'll know.

601
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,170
They'll never know.

602
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,550
I'm going to punch one right now.

603
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,110
Alright, do it then.

604
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,390
They won't know it's me.

605
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,670
Just be like, who's that pathfinding that punched him?

606
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,390
Alright, I'm here.

607
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:34,710
I'm not.

608
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,510
Evo Harvester online.

609
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,450
Ooh, yeah, we should get the Evos.

610
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,630
Alright, let me boost up my...

611
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,670
Try to get red armor.

612
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,230
That'll be huge.

613
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:44,850
You can get red armor.

614
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,210
I'm low balled in here.

615
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:48,850
I'm here.

616
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,770
Ooh, I got the Evo Harvester.

617
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,910
Yeah, it's just some friendly fisting.

618
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,130
What's wrong with that?

619
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,810
A lot.

620
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:58,890
What?

621
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:03,250
As long as both parties consent, then it'll be fine.

622
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:09,430
So, can you not pick up shields anymore?

623
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:11,750
You can pick up shields.

624
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:12,910
What do you mean?

625
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,650
Oh, you mean like farmer swaps?

626
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,490
Just like stuff in general.

627
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,310
I'm going to get that Evo Harvester.

628
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:22,390
I'll get that one.

629
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,530
Okay, I pinged that one.

630
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,590
I literally dibs it.

631
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,570
Oh, there's a guy here.

632
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,950
What if I just fist him?

633
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,830
By the way, if any of us die, you can just go craft.

634
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,150
You can instant craft one of us.

635
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,790
There's really no risk in running around.

636
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,130
You can literally just run around and do whatever you want.

637
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,070
Try to get all the Evos.

638
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,010
I don't even know what an Evo Harvester looks like.

639
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,030
It's yellow.

640
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,550
It's literally yellow.

641
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,350
I pinged it and you're just stealing it.

642
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,150
You're just not fast enough.

643
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,430
Wait, it gets it for all of us.

644
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,370
Yeah, exactly.

645
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,330
Oh my god, it doesn't matter.

646
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,530
It's literally not a competition.

647
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,710
We're a fucking team.

648
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,090
I thought it was mine.

649
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,090
Wait, what's with battery pack size?

650
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:06,930
We're at the end here.

651
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:07,830
We can't be split up at the end.

652
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,430
Wait, are we allowed to do ring consoles or no?

653
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:11,770
Yeah, yeah.

654
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,170
Just no damage anything and survive.

655
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:15,970
That's literally it.

656
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,830
Wait, so I can do survey?

657
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,610
I guess.

658
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,130
Yeah, yeah.

659
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,510
Alright, I'm going to fucking access survey.

660
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:27,370
If they say you did this or did that, just blame Manday for being muted for like 19 minutes.

661
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,010
That's so true.

662
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,610
Okay, but I feel like, I don't know, I think survey is not that helpful because there's so many high days anyway.

663
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,890
You get Evo for hitting it.

664
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:40,430
I do, but I can also get Evo for doing ring console and we can fight end game.

665
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,190
I hear shots.

666
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,190
I hear shots to the north.

667
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,950
We got a Seeker in Jurassic.

668
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,730
We got a Seeker in Jurassic.

669
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,590
I'm going for this Evo on the outskirts.

670
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,390
I'm going crazy.

671
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,350
Oh, he's going to go wild.

672
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,750
I have so many meds.

673
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,590
Yeah, what's going to happen to us?

674
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,010
Die?

675
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,670
That would be silly.

676
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:00,610
Okay, I'll do ring console.

677
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,810
Wait, there's a death box here.

678
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,610
Someone was like, but there's more survey.

679
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,490
It's alright, it's too late.

680
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,790
I wonder how many players are actually hiding.

681
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,710
There's no way anyone is actually hiding right now.

682
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,670
Surely everyone is just getting Evo.

683
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,210
What is the pink thing on the map?

684
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,430
Nobody is hiding.

685
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,210
Everybody is just getting armor right now.

686
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,050
Oh, I got a care pack baby.

687
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,070
I'm going to get a Kraber.

688
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,910
I'm going to go get this Evo.

689
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:30,730
Wait, if the Seeker is trying to kill you, just drop the Kraber for them as like a peace offering.

690
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,430
Wait, Linkster died to Sov?

691
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,170
Oh, Linkster got finished.

692
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,530
He didn't just die.

693
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,590
He got finished.

694
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,210
Finished.

695
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,270
Damn.

696
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:43,790
That's sad.

697
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:44,830
Noob down.

698
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,300
Alright, I'm going to do the ring console.

699
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,780
I might die for this if there's somebody there.

700
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,800
Do I do my tactical cooldown or my ultimate cooldown?

701
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,040
Probably tactical.

702
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,220
I think your tactical is more important.

703
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,680
But like, think about the griefing opportunities.

704
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,400
Is this person following me?

705
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,220
What am I punching right now?

706
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,700
I'm just a cereal puncher.

707
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,060
I just punch every random person I see.

708
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,380
There you go.

709
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,740
Oh, next ring.

710
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,360
Spotted.

711
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,260
The Seekers aren't allowed to hit man scans, right?

712
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,820
No, they're not allowed to.

713
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,680
Well, they said they're not allowed to play characters who can do it.

714
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,260
That's really good.

715
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,200
Wait, there's heat shields!

716
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,340
Yeah, I got one.

717
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:39,960
Alright.

718
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,040
I could just sit in zone for a long time if I didn't have syringes.

719
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,360
I got hella medkits.

720
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,100
I have... I have a decent amount of meds on me.

721
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,760
Oh wait, how does that just register?

722
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,360
We have heat shields?

723
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,460
We definitely need heat shields.

724
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,800
We all need a pair of heat shields actually.

725
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,920
Yeah, I have a heat shield on me.

726
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,060
I don't have one yet, but... I'm looking.

727
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,380
You're a Loba, you can... you can...

728
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:04,500
Yep.

729
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,100
Do whatever.

730
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,580
Where's the next ring console?

731
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:13,100
Try and save... save the crafters.

732
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,020
Like, because if one of us dies, we might have to craft banners.

733
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,040
That's true.

734
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,560
Alright, Surefour, that's your job.

735
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,620
Where's another ring console?

736
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,140
No, I'm the hider.

737
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:22,840
I'm so far.

738
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,980
Like, there's one here.

739
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,940
Make it head to the other side.

740
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,880
Get to fucking running.

741
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,280
I don't know if I should start hiding.

742
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,000
Someone died out of bounds?

743
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,900
Maybe AFK?

744
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,280
Alright, I'm just gonna start hiding here.

745
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,080
I know a good rat spot around this area.

746
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,000
Wait, yo, where's my scan for the next zone?

747
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,840
Okay, I'm heading over to the next zone now because it's on the other side of the map.

748
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,040
I feel like I could actually go on zone and... I'm gonna scan it in zone.

749
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
Oh no, that's just the ring killing the dragon.

750
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,190
I mean, I could scan in zone.

751
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,170
What's the worst thing that could happen?

752
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,210
I die?

753
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,610
They didn't say we're allowed to go in the ring, right?

754
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,910
They didn't make any rules against this?

755
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,390
Nope, they made literally zero rules.

756
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:25,130
They made not a lot of rules for this one.

757
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,970
We can take advantage of a lot of things.

758
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:30,870
I hear shooting.

759
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,070
Wait, where are you?

760
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:32,950
What color are you?

761
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,270
It sounded like the shooting was over here.

762
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:35,890
Alright,

763
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,240
how the fuck do you have rad shield?

764
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,800
I found a care package.

765
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,880
Alright, I'm scanning for us.

766
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,020
Rad shield in a minute.

767
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:49,840
Alright.

768
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,060
It's right here.

769
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,060
Alright, looking for my rat spot.

770
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,240
Wait, there's that one spot in the spider cave.

771
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,120
Did they ever fix it?

772
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,820
Well, time to find out.

773
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,790
Alright, I need you guys to give me some meds.

774
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:11,710
No.

775
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:12,890
What do you mean no?

776
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:13,910
No.

777
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,550
They're mine.

778
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:20,530
I sacrificed my life to give you guys a ring.

779
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,090
It looks like they fixed it.

780
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,930
I think this person was trying to do it.

781
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,550
I actually don't even remember where it was.

782
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,250
Do you guys have any shots around you?

783
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:39,930
Nope.

784
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,370
On my ping.

785
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,830
I guess you don't know which one is my ping.

786
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,650
I heard shots over here.

787
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,710
I used a crafter, so...

788
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:50,550
Whoops.

789
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,210
That's awkward.

790
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,050
Okay, so you're trolling.

791
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:55,690
That should be fun.

792
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,470
Heard.

793
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,190
There's no crafters in Sound 3 anyways, so...

794
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,250
By the time one of us dies, it'll be too late.

795
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,110
That's true.

796
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,470
I don't hear any shots.

797
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,550
Dude, where am I supposed to hide?

798
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,190
They have so many invisible walls now.

799
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,410
I believe in you.

800
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:18,310
Well, I know one gig of rat spot, but like...

801
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,530
What's the worst that could happen?

802
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,370
They shoot you?

803
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,690
They have no pro in their team.

804
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,450
The zone is not going to end where you're at.

805
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,850
It's going to keep pulling out towards the middle somewhere.

806
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:30,990
Yeah.

807
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,990
Alright, I'm heading over there.

808
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,570
I don't see a gun on him.

809
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:43,610
I'm going to sacrifice myself by running in the open so Verhulst will know if there's a person near me.

810
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,550
Am I able to hide on this tree?

811
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,510
Wait, I don't think they can look up.

812
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,570
There's a lot of skinny trees you can get on top of.

813
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:52,510
Can I hide here?

814
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,450
I saw Valkyrie trying to do it and it looks like she was just phasing through them.

815
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,090
Wait, I hear shooting.

816
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,030
There's a guy on my roof.

817
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,790
What the fuck are you doing here?

818
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,310
What if I punch you right now?

819
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,210
Oh my god, what do I...

820
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,910
Wait, what characters are the seekers on?

821
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:13,210
Do we know?

822
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:13,830
Nope.

823
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,450
No.

824
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,790
Dude, the fucking branches are invisible.

825
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,690
They'll never know.

826
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,090
How would they know?

827
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,450
Where the fuck do I hide?

828
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,390
This place sucks for hiding.

829
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,690
There's a seeker right on top of me.

830
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,450
Oh shit, wait, where are you?

831
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,690
He's chasing me.

832
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,190
I think he's at Octane.

833
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,150
Okay, so we know one of them's at Octane.

834
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,630
I'm pretty sure one's on Path too.

835
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,610
I think it's on Octane Path.

836
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,750
Oh my god, there's so many people running in right now.

837
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,210
There's so many people running in.

838
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,250
There's people here, but it's just a regular guy.

839
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,910
Where the fuck do I hide though?

840
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,450
Look, there's only one player dead.

841
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:09,910
No, there's two.

842
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:10,710
Two players.

843
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,390
Oh, I think they like res people too.

844
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,450
Yeah, they res.

845
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,870
I think the resing was a bad decision here.

846
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,790
It's gonna go down to end game for sure.

847
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,230
It's gonna head to end.

848
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,370
There's no way.

849
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:23,630
There's no way.

850
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:27,250
I think I saw only like two people actually die die.

851
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,990
Oh, there you go.

852
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,430
Good job, Todd.

853
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,930
You did it.

854
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,450
Guys, we have to move into zone.

855
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:34,510
They're not gonna have enough ammo.

856
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:35,830
That's what I'm saying.

857
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,610
They need a ballistic.

858
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,050
That's what I'm saying.

859
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,290
They need a ballistic.

860
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,330
If they didn't have a ballistic, it's over.

861
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:48,350
I don't even know if a team of three pros could kill an entire lobby.

862
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,490
No, they could.

863
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,270
If you have a ballistic, you can.

864
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,270
I literally just did a custom with hide and seek.

865
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,430
If you have a ballistic, you have non-stop ammo.

866
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,690
Like infinite ammo.

867
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,450
Dude, there's no hiding spots on this end game zone.

868
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,590
It's just gonna be everyone running around and I'm just gonna throw my ult.

869
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,250
It's like literally in the open.

870
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,590
Hey, who the frick are you?

871
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,830
Get out of my frickin' spot.

872
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:12,850
Stupid Pathfinder.

873
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,270
Oh shit, guys.

874
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,910
It finally went to 15.

875
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,130
We're good.

876
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,790
We're good.

877
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:21,330
I hear people.

878
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,290
Dude, no one's even hiding.

879
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,230
Everyone's just running around.

880
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:26,850
He's right here.

881
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:27,410
He's right here.

882
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,130
Right here, where I'm peeing.

883
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:29,550
That's him.

884
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:29,870
That's him.

885
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:30,250
That's him.

886
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,350
I'm hiding in the building with you.

887
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:34,750
I'm getting away from this guy.

888
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,570
Dude, you're running into another one, too.

889
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,470
Dude, there's no hiding spots around here.

890
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,610
I'm telling you right now.

891
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,810
There's zero hiding spots.

892
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:48,710
Also, the most likely hiding spot is the best hiding spot.

893
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,530
Because they're like, ah, no one's gonna be in there.

894
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,510
Like, who's gonna check in this frickin' house, bro?

895
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:56,370
Exactly.

896
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,030
They're too busy.

897
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,390
There's like so many people running around.

898
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,270
Yeah, they're too busy finding all the frickin' rats.

899
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,210
There's a guy right here.

900
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,850
He's coming up behind you!

901
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,730
He's at the spider cave!

902
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,710
He's gonna get ya!

903
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,930
THEY'RE TAKING FIRE!

904
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,410
WILLY'S TAKING OUT TWO!

905
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,080
There's one guy here.

906
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:23,620
Stick around here.

907
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:23,780
I'm here.

908
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

909
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,020
Keep pinging him if you guys see him.

910
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:27,960
Ah, fuck.

911
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:28,980
It's moving.

912
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,640
There's gonna be so many people in the spider cave.

913
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,600
What do we do, Surefour?

914
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,620
We're a little fucked over.

915
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,060
I'm just waiting until the last second.

916
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,660
Fuck it, bro.

917
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,300
We're gonna die to the ring of death.

918
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,120
I'm gonna thrive in the chaos.

919
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,120
That's my...

920
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,320
That's true, that's true.

921
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,080
I think, like, in the end...

922
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,700
This building is probably bis, bro.

923
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,840
That building's probably bis.

924
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,180
They're not gonna check that shit.

925
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:50,880
Yeah, that's right.

926
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,240
That's true.

927
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:51,560
That's true.

928
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,120
You should go there.

929
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,920
Wait, how would you even make it?

930
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,860
You're so far.

931
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,640
Uh, running?

932
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,820
We have armored zips!

933
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,300
You're right!

934
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,360
Girls, please.

935
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:04,840
You can't die.

936
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:05,380
You can't die.

937
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,400
You're literally our trump card.

938
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,260
You're literally here to survive.

939
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,460
You're a support.

940
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,060
Nah, nah, nah.

941
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,760
Not that I know of.

942
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,420
Not that I know of.

943
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,060
I mean, there's a bunch of, uh...

944
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,760
Excuse me, you guys have to evacuate soon.

945
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:16,700
Nah, nah, nah.

946
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,680
They're not gonna check the building.

947
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,480
They're just gonna keep...

948
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,120
Dude, there's so many rats outside, there's no way they'd come in.

949
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,700
I have, like, four other people in here with me.

950
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,160
We're gonna have four other people with you.

951
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:28,860
Oh!

952
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,640
He's in here!

953
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,620
They drew him into me!

954
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,220
They're griefing me.

955
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,580
They closed the door on me.

956
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,020
They closed the door on me.

957
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,460
There's one over here.

958
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,060
There's one over here, too.

959
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,340
Yo, come res me.

960
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:38,880
No balls.

961
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:38,880
Bro!

962
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,780
He's gonna finish you!

963
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,520
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

964
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,860
They're chasing someone else.

965
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,480
I don't know where they are.

966
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,480
Oh, okay!

967
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,100
Okay, that's so helpful!

968
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,400
They thirsted me.

969
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,380
Oh my god, and you wanted me to head over.

970
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,800
You wanted me to head over!

971
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,060
I got griefed.

972
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,700
I got griefed.

973
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,580
They closed the door on me.

974
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,760
I told you not to go in!

975
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,160
They made the person come into my spot, and then they griefed me!

976
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,020
I told you.

977
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,400
I told you not to come in.

978
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:09,880
I told you not to go.

979
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,140
This is why you can't trust human beings.

980
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,760
What if it was a VTuber, though?

981
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,160
They only want to see the worst in the world.

982
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:15,920
He's right here.

983
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,800
He's right over here.

984
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,860
I see you're here.

985
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,140
Wait, do you have a res beacon?

986
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,360
Bro, everyone's stealing your G.

987
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,380
I know, I know.

988
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,740
I'm just strengthening my army.

989
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,960
You're strengthening your army?

990
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,240
This has not turned into a hide-and-seek event.

991
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,620
This has turned into just, like, a manhunt event.

992
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,540
No one's hiding.

993
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,240
Everyone's just running around.

994
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,260
I gotta stay close to the pack.

995
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,410
What if I finish this guy right in front of me?

996
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,070
What if I just...

997
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:04,730
Res me up.

998
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:05,270
Res me up.

999
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,890
If I finish him, they won't think I'm a seeker.

1000
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,590
Uh-oh.

1001
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:12,370
Uh-oh.

1002
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,110
Uh-oh.

1003
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,190
Uh -oh.

1004
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,020
I'm getting up here.

1005
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,440
This is a safe spot up here.

1006
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,700
Did you just kill someone?

1007
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:30,700
No.

1008
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,100
You have 115 damage.

1009
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,050
He was gonna die regardless!

1010
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,670
I swear, he was gonna die regardless.

1011
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,370
I swear to God.

1012
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,150
That's fucked up.

1013
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,450
No one's hiding on this screen!

1014
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:54,490
It's just a body of people!

1015
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,790
They must be out of ammo already.

1016
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,710
There's no way they're not out of ammo.

1017
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,470
Dude, they're gonna have to start punching people.

1018
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,410
How am I supposed to shoot his office?

1019
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,090
There's, like, rezzing.

1020
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,430
Somebody's fucking rezzing in the open.

1021
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:15,590
Oh my God, there's a guy, like...

1022
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,650
Someone's gonna touch you.

1023
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,090
He's gonna touch me.

1024
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,710
Wait, where the fuck did these guys come from?

1025
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,710
Some of these people are, like...

1026
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,970
Wait, land on the fucking rezz, bro.

1027
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,250
The hiding spot up there.

1028
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,010
Hide in the fucking rezz spot.

1029
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,270
Oh, you're landing on fucking doom!

1030
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:33,550
No!

1031
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:34,350
I'm good, I'm good.

1032
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,200
I hear someone with Sheila.

1033
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,400
Bro, what is going on?

1034
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,140
This is...

1035
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,240
I told you, this isn't hide and seek.

1036
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,160
This is manhunt.

1037
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,300
Bro, somebody is a Sheila right now.

1038
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,520
Oh God, they got gunned the fuck down.

1039
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,260
Look at these guys.

1040
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,960
Oh my God, they have nades and everything.

1041
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,600
Dude, imagine if I have Horizontal right now.

1042
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,160
Imagine if you're still alive.

1043
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,400
Bro, I got griefed, man.

1044
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,560
It's fine, you guys got this win.

1045
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,400
You guys got this win.

1046
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,820
What if I finish on this guy right here?

1047
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,440
Bro, there's just zips everywhere.

1048
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,480
This isn't hide and seek at all.

1049
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,140
Oh my God.

1050
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,560
Where am I?

1051
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,760
They're starting to whittle us down.

1052
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,180
They're running out of ammo for sure.

1053
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,700
They've resorted to shotguns, bro.

1054
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,780
Oh no!

1055
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,000
No!

1056
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,040
Don't die!

1057
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,320
Oh no, no, no, no.

1058
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,280
No, no, no, no.

1059
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,520
You survived?

1060
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,000
Nice.

1061
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:52,700
Survived?

1062
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,820
Wait, some people are resing right there, bro.

1063
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,760
Where's our res at?

1064
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,500
We didn't get you better!

1065
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,500
Guys, I think they actually ran out... I hear zero shots.

1066
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,500
They 100% ran out of ammo, bro.

1067
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,340
Why does that guy have a bow?

1068
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,180
You can't let them access this.

1069
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,880
You have to close the shop down the moment...

1070
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,960
No, he put the shop down so they could have ammo.

1071
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,620
No, oh no.

1072
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,880
Yeah, he's trying to help them out.

1073
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,440
Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.

1074
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,500
You should have grabbed that Kraber and gave it to them as a peace offering.

1075
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,120
That's true.

1076
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:32,800
That's true.

1077
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:38,000
What if I get a Kraber from your thing right now and just shoot one of them?

1078
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:38,860
Don't die!

1079
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,870
Uh oh.

1080
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:46,270
Uh oh.

1081
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:46,810
Not good.

1082
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:48,250
Oh?

1083
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:49,810
Not good.

1084
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:50,650
Oh?

1085
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,370
I think it's endgame.

1086
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:55,750
I think this is endgame.

1087
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:56,610
We're good, we're good.

1088
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,050
Hey, one squad's out.

1089
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,550
19 squads left.

1090
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:06,170
Butterfly knife melee.

1091
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:09,230
Yeah, they definitely don't have...

1092
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,510
Dude, how are they supposed to kill any of the people zipping?

1093
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,390
Maybe ability shouldn't have been allowed.

1094
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,550
They always have abilities.

1095
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:21,570
Uh oh.

1096
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:21,930
Uh oh.

1097
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:23,030
Oh no.

1098
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:23,730
No!

1099
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:24,990
Alright, it's up to you.

1100
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,270
It's up to you, Doki.

1101
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,390
No, I can't heal up.

1102
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:29,230
Doki, don't!

1103
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:30,710
Just look at them!

1104
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:31,050
I can't see him!

1105
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,570
I can't see him!

1106
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:33,350
Survive!

1107
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:34,950
Look at his banner!

1108
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:35,830
You can heal, you're good.

1109
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:36,750
Oh shit.

1110
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:38,090
No!

1111
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:38,390
No!

1112
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:39,510
Dang it.

1113
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:40,470
I died to zone.

1114
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,690
Dude, that was focused.

1115
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,190
I was trying to heal!

1116
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,550
I couldn't!

1117
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,790
It touched my foot!

1118
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:51,790
It touched my foot!

1119
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:53,150
Dude, what is this, man?

1120
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:56,310
I told you they needed ballistic!

1121
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,530
They had no ballistic, they can't live!

1122
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:00,530
They're not even gonna win the game.

1123
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:01,810
They're gonna get like 15th.

1124
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,230
How are they gonna find out who won?

1125
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,770
They have a leaderboard at the end.

1126
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:07,550
Bro!

1127
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,330
Look, my game plan...

1128
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:14,210
We bet on Evan to live, but...

1129
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:17,090
They're all dropping like flies now.

1130
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,250
Game over.

1131
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:21,670
I don't even think the Seekers survive.

1132
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:24,090
Of course they...

1133
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,170
I bet a fucking...

1134
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:27,370
Yeah, I bet a fucking Hider won!

1135
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,270
No, the Seekers definitely...

1136
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,810
I watched the Seekers, they got like 15th.

1137
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:33,810
No, look!

1138
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:35,190
Fun won!

1139
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:36,690
Wait, Dyrus won!

1140
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:37,630
Dyrus won!

1141
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:40,090
Dyrus actually won!

1142
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,950
That's like crazy!

1143
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:46,730
Wait, the Seekers came in like in 9th place!

1144
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:50,910
I can't believe it!

1145
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:53,870
The Seekers are 9th!

1146
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:55,690
Only top 3 got points, right?

1147
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,850
Yeah, well, top 3 wins money.

1148
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:00,330
Each game is like its own prize.

1149
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:01,330
Yeah.

1150
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:04,110
That's fucking hilarious.

1151
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,350
Aw, Wraith would have been a god tier player.

1152
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:06,910
I didn't think about Wraith.

1153
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:09,590
Yeah, you just keep fucking...

1154
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:12,590
Yeah, we planned on...

1155
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:18,530
We planned on Wraith hulking the entire time, but that didn't happen.

1156
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:20,410
I panicked.

1157
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:22,750
My foot touched the zone.

1158
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:29,850
Wait, wait.

1159
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,350
Team 2 got 3 kills.

1160
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:33,210
Team 2?

1161
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:34,850
How the fuck did Team 2...

1162
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:35,390
They...

1163
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:36,650
How are they getting 3 kills?

1164
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:37,730
Yeah, how did they get...

1165
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:38,130
Yeah.

1166
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,690
Hmm...

1167
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,090
Wait, what the fuck?

1168
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:46,150
Team 5 literally has 2 pros.

1169
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:48,610
Wait a minute.

1170
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,570
Wait a minute.

1171
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:54,610
That's fucking life, isn't it?

1172
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:58,790
Who's supposed to be on their team?

1173
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:01,250
Well...

1174
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,170
Wait, they're missing a VTuber on their team.

1175
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,150
Wait a minute, this team doesn't even have a VTuber.

1176
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:09,350
They're getting penalties.

1177
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,170
Like, they can only play with one gun or something.

1178
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:17,350
Game 2 is standard ALGS custom match.

1179
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,360
Oh, so it's just a regular game.

1180
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,480
Alright, what do we play?

1181
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:34,260
Do we do...

1182
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,860
Do we do the support shit?

1183
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:41,200
The meta is Gibraltar, Catalyst, Newcastle.

1184
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,200
Alright, I call Gibraltar.

1185
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,140
Throwing cover for Roberto.

1186
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,940
Trifor, you got some good Newcastle gameplay?

1187
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,980
Never played them once in my life.

1188
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,540
Okay, to be fair, you haven't played a lot of characters.

1189
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,200
That's true.

1190
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,980
I'll play whatever.

1191
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,710
Alright, what do we get?

1192
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,670
What do we do, IGL?

1193
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:18,130
Oh shit, we gotta claim stuff?

1194
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,830
We gotta claim drop spots.

1195
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:22,430
Yeah.

1196
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:25,390
We're on world's edge.

1197
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:27,730
Well, I'm going to the washroom.

1198
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,930
I don't know if anyone is playing Clowntizer, but I'm claiming it.

1199
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:34,010
Oh, someone claimed it.

1200
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:36,290
Guys, I didn't do anything.

1201
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:37,550
See, I have zero kills.

1202
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:38,810
Look at my name.

1203
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,610
Zero kills, right there.

1204
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,030
Are we just...

1205
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:03,370
We're playing what?

1206
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:06,610
Newcastle, Gibraltar, Catalyst?

1207
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,720
Alright, good talk.

1208
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:11,960
Yup.

1209
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,020
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1210
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,760
I'm just reading through the POIs.

1211
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,600
I'm trying to actually get us a POI.

1212
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,820
Wait, somebody else tried to claim Clowntizer.

1213
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,260
Yeah, we're going to go SkyWest Trials instead.

1214
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:22,900
Okay.

1215
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,340
Wait, did you claim it already?

1216
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,340
Yeah.

1217
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,720
In the game chat, but...

1218
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:31,440
Alright, I double claimed it.

1219
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:33,840
Double claimed what?

1220
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,720
All of SkyWest.

1221
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,320
I'll even say all of SkyWest.

1222
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,700
Oh no, I'll be like SkyWest East.

1223
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,100
So then they'll think I'm...

1224
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,340
They'll think that like...

1225
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,100
I'm a different team.

1226
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,680
Surefour doesn't type anything yet.

1227
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:47,660
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1228
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,500
Surefour, type SkyWest East.

1229
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:55,410
So then they'll think like there's two teams already.

1230
00:49:58,990 --> 00:49:59,830
I got it.

1231
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:00,850
Nice.

1232
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:04,190
I think Zero's trying to contest SkyWest.

1233
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:05,890
Unless he's like fucking around.

1234
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,220
He's on Zero's team.

1235
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:11,860
Oh, they have...

1236
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,760
Zero, Nasty, Meek, I mean...

1237
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,600
Do you guys think he can handle Nasty?

1238
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:18,780
Or Zero?

1239
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,020
Wait, Zero's team has two pros too?

1240
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:23,720
Well...

1241
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,160
What the fuck?

1242
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,520
What happened to their team?

1243
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:28,700
What are you talking about?

1244
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:29,060
Team 11?

1245
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,700
Yeah, and Zero has...

1246
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,720
Oh yeah, they...

1247
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,180
Wait, their entire team's different.

1248
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,960
A lot of people dropped out last second, I guess.

1249
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,180
Oh no, that's Zero plus.

1250
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,160
Oh my god, there's too many Zeros in this world.

1251
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,600
Zero's ahead in the game.

1252
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,420
You didn't even notice.

1253
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,600
I don't even know.

1254
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,800
There's like four teams already.

1255
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,660
I'm with the guy.

1256
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:02,550
Why is nobody here?

1257
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:03,750
Why did people leave?

1258
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:05,410
They hate us.

1259
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,590
Starting game, everyone's here.

1260
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:17,530
Yeah, we might get conned by like four teams.

1261
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:18,470
Oh shit.

1262
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:19,790
That's good.

1263
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:20,910
We just have to frag out.

1264
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:21,790
Why is that good?

1265
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:24,230
Yeah, but do they have Verhosto on their team?

1266
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:25,050
That's the thing.

1267
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:26,930
True.

1268
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:28,230
That's so true, right?

1269
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:36,670
Did you guys take any Adderall before we played today?

1270
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,810
I haven't taken it once.

1271
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,670
I'm scared to take it.

1272
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:45,830
I'm scared to take it because what if I become too ascended and I can never go back?

1273
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:50,270
Yeah, but don't you want to...

1274
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:52,630
Don't you want to feel what it's like to be a god?

1275
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:56,250
Wait.

1276
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,390
What if I take steroids?

1277
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,270
Wouldn't that just like...

1278
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:09,030
Is it true that steroids like shrink parts of your body?

1279
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:10,610
Yeah, it shrinks your balls.

1280
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:12,150
Wait, just your balls?

1281
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:13,070
Yeah.

1282
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:14,850
Oh shit, wait, why does that...

1283
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:15,550
You deal with everything else.

1284
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:17,690
Oh, I mean that's a...

1285
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:19,150
That's a good compromise.

1286
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:21,170
I get high.

1287
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:25,370
You also die at a younger age because...

1288
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:27,170
Your heart's going overdrive and shit.

1289
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:27,730
Oh, that's true.

1290
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:29,010
Your heart gets bigger, right?

1291
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,770
If you take steroids because it grows everything.

1292
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:32,090
You get super jacked.

1293
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,450
Yeah, but then you get super jacked.

1294
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,770
So, I mean, doesn't...

1295
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:39,290
Don't most pro wrestlers take steroids?

1296
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:42,790
Like The Rock?

1297
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:44,770
Is The Rock on roids?

1298
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:45,090
Yeah.

1299
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:46,290
Maybe.

1300
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:48,010
I mean, look at him.

1301
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:50,710
Yeah, I think most WWE guys are on steroids.

1302
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:58,650
I just look at the thing with people on steroids and I look at their traps and it looks like a little person in like a meat suit.

1303
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,720
I'm so...

1304
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,100
Oh my god, this...

1305
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,420
I'm going to be late for Mother's Stream.

1306
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,860
I feel like we're going to be like...

1307
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,180
Like a 15 minute break every game.

1308
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,120
And then Saab was like, don't worry.

1309
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,820
We're going to go fast.

1310
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,360
We're going to go so fucking fast.

1311
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,680
You know how these things fucking go, man.

1312
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,040
I thought it'd be different.

1313
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,780
He said it would be like super fast.

1314
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,380
Like we're going to go so fucking fast.

1315
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,300
Well, sometimes people get lied to.

1316
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:37,700
Yeah.

1317
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,020
I'm so...

1318
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,940
I'm so happy to be here, guys.

1319
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,860
We could literally play Subway Surfers on the side right now.

1320
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,000
Hey, yo, hop on Webfishing.

1321
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,220
Oh shit, wait.

1322
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:58,200
Did they fix the thing where hackers were like...

1323
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,620
Hackers were like going into people's servers and doxing people?

1324
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
They weren't going into my servers, at least.

1325
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,020
Oh shit, okay.

1326
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:06,820
What's the code?

1327
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,440
Let me launch real quick.

1328
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,920
Guys, hop on Webfishing, everybody.

1329
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,680
Let's all go on Webfishing together.

1330
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,220
Let's have like our...

1331
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,780
My fan base fight Sureforce fan base.

1332
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,720
And also Overhaul's fan base.

1333
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,740
I'm pretty sure mine play video games.

1334
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,280
Mine play video games?

1335
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,120
What are you trying to imply about my fan base?

1336
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,420
Oh, you know.

1337
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,080
No, your fan base can't play video games because they...

1338
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,140
And they vicariously live through you.

1339
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:38,540
Okay, so what are yours doing then?

1340
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,320
They just think I'm funny.

1341
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:43,640
Oh.

1342
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:48,680
The code is N P Y T 2 K.

1343
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,000
N P Y...

1344
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,300
Can you say it again?

1345
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,160
T 2 K.

1346
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,160
N P Y...

1347
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,360
T 2 K.

1348
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,840
T 2 K.

1349
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:58,400
Okay.

1350
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,820
Alright, I'm going in.

1351
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,320
I'm going to the docs.

1352
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,900
It's loading in.

1353
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,540
The server is marked 18+.

1354
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,420
Are you guys in too?

1355
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,220
Dragoons, are you in as well?

1356
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,860
Yeah, you can ERP on this server if you want.

1357
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:19,780
Dragoons, you hear that?

1358
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,660
You can ERP.

1359
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,340
Yeah, of course you would say that.

1360
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,280
But you're the one that suggested it.

1361
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:27,960
Yeah, it's a suggestion.

1362
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,580
Yeah, and I'm telling my dragoons that...

1363
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,340
And suggestions show people's moral compasses.

1364
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,300
Yeah, so, like, dragoons, if you really want to, it's 18+.

1365
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,740
Alright, who is a dragoon in here?

1366
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:43,400
Listen, I've seen random art of people that they draw of you.

1367
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:44,680
Guys, wait.

1368
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,620
On my 4-year page.

1369
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,600
These people are freaks.

1370
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:46,980
Wait.

1371
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:52,640
I think air traffic control is one of the hackers.

1372
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,200
Is it?

1373
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,600
Ain't no way.

1374
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,320
I think he's the one that doxxes the airport.

1375
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,160
Doxxes the airport?

1376
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:08,880
Ain't no way they're just watching your stream waiting, bro.

1377
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,120
I'm scared.

1378
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:11,780
I'm scared.

1379
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,580
I mean, they left already.

1380
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,760
Yeah, there's a thing.

1381
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,580
There's a thing where some of the hackers would...

1382
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,080
They would literally, like...

1383
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,300
Wait, am I even in your server?

1384
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:26,740
I don't know.

1385
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,420
Did I join the wrong one?

1386
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,360
I'm pretty sure you are, because I saw you join.

1387
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:32,080
Oh, okay.

1388
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,580
I'm at the doxx, Brit.

1389
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:34,980
Where the fuck is the doxx?

1390
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,120
Do you even play web phishing, bro?

1391
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,440
I played it one time.

1392
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:39,700
You noob or what?

1393
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:40,820
Nobody's talking, though.

1394
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:41,920
Why is nobody talking?

1395
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:46,640
You can't talk.

1396
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,300
We're cats.

1397
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,400
I'm a dog.

1398
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:51,920
Ew.

1399
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:52,840
What's wrong?

1400
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,000
What's wrong with being a dog?

1401
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,560
I see you guys.

1402
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,680
You picked a fucking dog?

1403
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,340
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

1404
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,540
Bow, bow, bow, bow.

1405
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,540
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow.

1406
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,300
How are we still not...

1407
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:09,900
Oh, wait, we're starting.

1408
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,320
Oh, shit.

1409
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:12,780
Guys, wait, we're phishing.

1410
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,240
We're phishing, guys.

1411
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,300
Wait, I just got here.

1412
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,800
Oh, shit.

1413
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,180
I got it.

1414
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,800
Dog clutch.

1415
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,580
Alright, there we go.

1416
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,160
There we go.

1417
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:22,960
Hey, guys.

1418
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:23,860
I'm here now.

1419
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:30,870
Why is nobody talking, guys?

1420
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:32,770
Oh, it's because I was on local chat.

1421
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:34,030
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

1422
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,870
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

1423
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:37,350
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

1424
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:37,810
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

1425
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:37,850
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

1426
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:38,950
Well, time for an exodus.

1427
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:39,830
Killing everyone.

1428
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:41,090
Oh, okay.

1429
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:42,130
Who's left the game?

1430
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:44,850
Alright, now we actually play.

1431
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:50,110
Just jump faster.

1432
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:52,530
I'm really pushing.

1433
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:53,710
The plan?

1434
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:55,470
Yeah.

1435
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:58,290
That's the most experienced.

1436
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:00,370
One of us can go north.

1437
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:01,490
One of us can go south.

1438
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,190
And the other guy goes trials.

1439
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,210
I'll probably just go...

1440
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:06,730
I think some people were saying they were going trials in the chat, though.

1441
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:07,170
Yeah.

1442
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:08,170
Yeah, they're gonna get slammed.

1443
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:11,050
Alright, godspeed.

1444
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:12,190
I'll go north.

1445
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:12,370
I believe.

1446
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:14,330
Because I'm from the north.

1447
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:16,390
Alright.

1448
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:18,430
Wait, where am I supposed to go, again?

1449
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:20,110
I don't know, south or something?

1450
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:21,990
Wait, do I follow you?

1451
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:23,950
Oh, okay.

1452
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,550
What if we get fucked?

1453
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:28,410
Well, if we get fucked, we get fucked.

1454
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:29,590
That's life, isn't it?

1455
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:31,210
I think we're good.

1456
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:32,070
I'm pretty sure we're good.

1457
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,010
I don't see anyone.

1458
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:34,330
Are we split off, then?

1459
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,510
Alright, then I'll loot here.

1460
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:37,350
One of you can go north.

1461
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:37,990
One of you go south.

1462
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:38,790
I'm north.

1463
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:39,870
Team SkyEast, okay?

1464
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:40,430
Just be careful.

1465
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:41,830
I'm going here.

1466
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:43,930
Just, like, loot away from SkyEast.

1467
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:46,330
Like, start in the middle and come left.

1468
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:47,190
Yeah, sure, four.

1469
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:47,890
Start in the middle.

1470
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:48,790
Okay, that's not middle.

1471
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:53,030
Don't worry about it.

1472
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:56,150
Wait, what's the meta guns right now?

1473
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:58,970
The Nemesis, Triple Take.

1474
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:00,770
Oh, yeah, Triple Take.

1475
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:02,310
Yeah, Triple Take is so good right now.

1476
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:03,170
I saw everybody playing it.

1477
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:04,050
Triple Take is, like, the best gun.

1478
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,590
What's the secondary, then, for it?

1479
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:10,950
Mastiff or Peacekeeper or Eva.

1480
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:12,990
Alright, I'm going to aim for...

1481
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:14,530
I hope that Mastiff is the best.

1482
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,750
I'm going to aim for Mastiff, then.

1483
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:20,550
Oh, shit, still hard.

1484
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:21,910
Wait, isn't that Dyrus' team?

1485
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:22,730
They're already eliminated?

1486
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:24,690
I don't think that was them.

1487
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:26,550
They already got eliminated, okay?

1488
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:28,490
I don't think that was Dyrus' team.

1489
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,510
No, they won first place in hiding.

1490
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,690
That was their team name.

1491
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:33,870
Was it?

1492
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:34,470
Yeah.

1493
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:36,430
You pretty sure?

1494
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:37,770
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

1495
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:39,150
I think you're lying.

1496
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:40,630
I'm not lying.

1497
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,970
They're no longer hard, yeah.

1498
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:45,290
I'm hard.

1499
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:46,550
Whoa!

1500
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:48,830
I'm hard in the paint right now.

1501
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:50,250
Damn, in the heart?

1502
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:51,690
I'm getting motivated.

1503
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,800
Oh my god, everybody's fighting.

1504
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:01,660
There's going to be like...

1505
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,340
There's going to be like only 10 teams left in Zone 1.

1506
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:12,760
I hear someone shooting.

1507
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:13,400
Oh, it's you.

1508
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:14,580
No, it's not.

1509
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,300
Oh, that's him.

1510
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,020
Is there a triple take in there?

1511
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:17,660
Nope.

1512
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,180
I'm trying to find a triple take, too.

1513
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:19,900
There might be, actually.

1514
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,920
I can tell you in a sec.

1515
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,860
More people are dying.

1516
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,420
Dying is cool.

1517
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,100
A lot of contests.

1518
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,120
We should get the evil harvester whenever we can.

1519
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,260
I don't want to.

1520
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,440
We have to.

1521
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,860
How many teams?

1522
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,680
There's 20 drop spots.

1523
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,480
How are you guys contesting?

1524
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,480
Because they just wanted to freaking be white.

1525
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:52,700
They just wanted to freaking go ham.

1526
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,660
We should've just landed on somebody, to be honest.

1527
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,900
True, true.

1528
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,220
Take that 50-50.

1529
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,520
We all love gotcha.

1530
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,920
I don't know how my character works.

1531
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:09,860
You press Q and then stuff happens.

1532
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:13,600
I'm coming.

1533
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,140
You're by yourself.

1534
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:15,960
I'm coming slowly.

1535
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,140
We're all heading over.

1536
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,060
We're all heading over.

1537
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,680
I'm here.

1538
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,400
I'm here now.

1539
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:23,440
I don't know what to do with it, but I got it.

1540
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:23,860
Where are they?

1541
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,520
He's got one.

1542
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:26,100
Nice.

1543
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,500
He's almost got another.

1544
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,180
I'm pushing the other side of this wall.

1545
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,380
I got one.

1546
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,000
Got him.

1547
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:38,220
Nice.

1548
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,440
Nice job.

1549
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:43,380
I accidentally have toggle aim on.

1550
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,820
This is bad.

1551
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,280
Toggle aim?

1552
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,400
Why do you have that setting?

1553
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,940
My settings got reset.

1554
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:54,900
My settings got reset today, so I didn't fix everything.

1555
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:55,600
I'm going.

1556
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,840
You can do it alone.

1557
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:58,500
We don't have to pull you.

1558
01:01:58,580 --> 01:01:59,240
I'm on the way.

1559
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:00,560
Oh my god, how do I do this?

1560
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,300
Increased revive move speed?

1561
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,020
Say less.

1562
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,340
Okay, I need a...

1563
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:04,920
Okay, what do I get?

1564
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:06,600
Fast shoties or big brother?

1565
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,340
What do I change?

1566
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,220
The shotgun one.

1567
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,500
Where is my right click?

1568
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:15,480
Toggle...

1569
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:16,720
Oh, there we go.

1570
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:17,960
There we go.

1571
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,500
Now it's better.

1572
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,700
What team even was that?

1573
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,180
I don't know.

1574
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,620
The shotgun one?

1575
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,620
Yeah, get the shotgun one.

1576
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,800
I did zero damage.

1577
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,180
By the way, there's a gold bag in here.

1578
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:28,860
You can run through that.

1579
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,660
Let's go get this guy there.

1580
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,060
I'm coming.

1581
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,000
I'm slow.

1582
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,360
Nice job, guys.

1583
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,700
What do you mean nice job, Doki?

1584
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,460
Surefour wasn't even here.

1585
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,000
What was he doing?

1586
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:44,560
I was running.

1587
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,140
All right, sure.

1588
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,440
We're going to give you the 1v3 for this next fight.

1589
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,420
I was running to get an evo thing.

1590
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:51,420
Guys, who did we kill?

1591
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:52,460
And then a fight started.

1592
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,120
Guys, we need a no.

1593
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,140
I need no so I can boost my own ego.

1594
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:00,700
What the fuck?

1595
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:01,460
I claimed that.

1596
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,120
Come, come, come, guys.

1597
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:03,640
Come, come, come.

1598
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,040
Well, I don't give a fuck.

1599
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,700
Whoa, it does not respect pings.

1600
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,100
I'm fucking cool like that.

1601
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,220
I'm holding over.

1602
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,780
I have too much stuff.

1603
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,260
I don't even know what a gold bag does now.

1604
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,100
It holds more stuff.

1605
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,040
Wow.

1606
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:21,240
Wow.

1607
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,040
All right, we're close.

1608
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,500
Take this gold helmet, Doki.

1609
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:26,880
Yippee.

1610
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,400
I'm getting shot at above.

1611
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,400
Bubble, bubble, third bubble down.

1612
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:34,160
Okay.

1613
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,160
We're just going to slide down.

1614
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,560
Yeah, slide into buildings here, okay?

1615
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,980
Wait, they have triple take?

1616
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:39,580
That's legal.

1617
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:43,460
I'm about to use your Q, Surefour, on the way down.

1618
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:43,800
You're good.

1619
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:46,540
We're going to avoid that team.

1620
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:47,060
They have a good spot.

1621
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:48,620
We're going to run through skywalk and go east.

1622
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,440
Okay, cool.

1623
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:50,160
Heard.

1624
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:53,920
They're trying to slide down, maybe?

1625
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:55,840
They are sliding down, actually.

1626
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:56,900
Wait, they want to fight?

1627
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:57,880
They might try fighting us.

1628
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:58,820
Yeah, keep going east.

1629
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,540
Let's go to this building here.

1630
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,060
Fucking nerds.

1631
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,820
We can definitely slam that team if they keep coming out this way.

1632
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:07,720
Let's try and get to this building here.

1633
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:08,580
Okay.

1634
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:11,620
Someone died to zone.

1635
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,860
Let's go to the south here and try and get behind them.

1636
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,120
Okay.

1637
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:16,100
I think they're just trying to hit the console.

1638
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,520
If they are, we can hold them out and actually kill them.

1639
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:19,220
Heard.

1640
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:21,240
No, they're not in console.

1641
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:21,900
They're here.

1642
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:22,740
Batting.

1643
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:25,020
Not in a good spot here.

1644
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:25,800
Me too.

1645
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:27,360
They're just trying to fight.

1646
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:27,920
They're trying to fight.

1647
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:29,700
Go to this forest door here.

1648
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:30,480
They're pushing.

1649
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:30,860
They're pushing.

1650
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:31,000
I broke one.

1651
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,320
Come back to this forest door if you guys can.

1652
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,020
I'm trying to walk you across.

1653
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:36,240
I'm crossing.

1654
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:36,780
Oh, my game just froze.

1655
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:37,460
Hello?

1656
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:38,720
Oh, that's not good.

1657
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:40,940
I don't think Surefour is going to live, but...

1658
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:42,580
You're alive.

1659
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,040
Congratulations.

1660
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:46,780
I'm going to take...

1661
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:47,360
I need my ult.

1662
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:52,900
I'm going to go to the roof here.

1663
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:53,720
Me too.

1664
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:56,180
I'm on the roof.

1665
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:58,140
Do we see them anywhere?

1666
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:00,420
I don't have a lot of energy ammo.

1667
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:01,600
Kill one.

1668
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:01,800
Kill one.

1669
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:02,040
Kill us.

1670
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:02,480
Kill us.

1671
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:03,440
He's down on the crate.

1672
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:03,820
Down on the crate.

1673
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:04,460
I can't.

1674
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:04,740
I can't.

1675
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,300
They shield him.

1676
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:06,820
They shield him.

1677
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:07,300
I'm sending.

1678
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:07,600
I'm sending.

1679
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,560
I can ult this.

1680
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,360
Oh, fuck.

1681
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:13,620
I hit the wall.

1682
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:14,260
I broke one.

1683
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:15,320
I'm sorry.

1684
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:17,820
Dead here.

1685
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,060
Nice.

1686
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:21,400
They're trying to run away.

1687
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,220
They're trying to run away on the crate here.

1688
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:22,560
They're running.

1689
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,620
One almost broke.

1690
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:25,700
He ulted.

1691
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:28,780
He's dead.

1692
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:31,820
Almost cracked him.

1693
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:33,260
Nice.

1694
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:33,720
Got him.

1695
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:34,740
Okay.

1696
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:42,280
I dropped down and hit the fucking...

1697
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,200
Oh, my God.

1698
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,140
I hit the wall.

1699
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:45,060
It's fine.

1700
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,120
Let's go, guys.

1701
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:49,400
Look at that.

1702
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:50,160
Let's go.

1703
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,060
Oh, yeah.

1704
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,540
Apparently, kill points matter, by the way.

1705
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:57,380
I kind of like the volt.

1706
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,420
Grab the volt.

1707
01:05:59,460 --> 01:05:59,640
Really?

1708
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,400
I would not recommend it.

1709
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:02,940
You have to take this mask if I'm commanding you.

1710
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,800
I need energy ammo if people find any.

1711
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:06,800
Because I have like...

1712
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,000
Oh, yeah.

1713
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:07,360
What do I get?

1714
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,680
Bubble bunker or baby bubble?

1715
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,340
Get the one that lasts longer.

1716
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:11,120
I think it's the one on the right.

1717
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:12,500
Whatever one adds plus four seconds.

1718
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,080
Yeah, that's the one I got.

1719
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,560
I am so poor.

1720
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:19,800
There's more shield bats.

1721
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:23,040
I have like 19.6k shield bats.

1722
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:24,940
Can you drop me some?

1723
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:25,320
I only have two.

1724
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:27,600
Thank you.

1725
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,580
I'm going to drop four syringes here.

1726
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,320
We're all running energy.

1727
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,960
We're cannibalizing each other.

1728
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,680
By the way, if we're ever in a sketch situation, Doki, you're just going to throw bubble down.

1729
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:39,480
Like if we're like...

1730
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:39,900
All right.

1731
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,200
I'll tell you as well.

1732
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:44,060
Let's try and walk forward here.

1733
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:45,560
Walking.

1734
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:48,200
I'm gum gum.

1735
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:48,900
We're going to peek this building.

1736
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:49,940
All right.

1737
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,620
We need energy.

1738
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,400
We're going to take this building here.

1739
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,220
I don't think anyone's here.

1740
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:56,260
If someone's here, you just bubble and we run away.

1741
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:56,920
Energy.

1742
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,080
Well, shooting from across.

1743
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:02,600
We'll make it.

1744
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,480
Got my shotgun ready just in case.

1745
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:07,920
I'm going to climb on the roof here.

1746
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:08,640
Just got to run.

1747
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,520
Nobody's hiding.

1748
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:12,560
There's energy.

1749
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,440
Team's on blue armor over there.

1750
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:18,700
I guess it's 63.

1751
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,700
I can't really do much poking right now.

1752
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,220
Do you know what armor he's on, Sherry?

1753
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:23,800
What armor was he?

1754
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,180
There's more bats here.

1755
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,000
There's a team here.

1756
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:26,940
One of them was on blue.

1757
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:31,800
I want to loot these bins, but it's a little...

1758
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,700
The team across the street, right?

1759
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:33,220
That's what you're talking about?

1760
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:33,580
Like this team?

1761
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:34,320
Yeah, this team.

1762
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:35,260
Okay.

1763
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:35,940
He's behind that bin.

1764
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,260
We might just end up killing them, honestly.

1765
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:38,920
All right.

1766
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:42,320
You guys do all the poking because I only have 100 bullets.

1767
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,180
He's on blue, 21.

1768
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,500
If I knock somebody, we just kill this.

1769
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:52,240
All right, cool.

1770
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:55,820
I'll look back here.

1771
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:56,900
Wait, what the fuck?

1772
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:58,900
I guess I won't look back.

1773
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,380
I'll look back here, just in case.

1774
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:02,660
Someone should look at our right.

1775
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:06,580
There's an all-out thing here.

1776
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,140
Our right's clear.

1777
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:09,820
Right side clear.

1778
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:10,640
I'm looking at left.

1779
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:12,700
Our left's clear.

1780
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,520
One has red, one has red pushing you.

1781
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:15,280
Yeah, they're trying to walk up.

1782
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,260
Our left and our right are clear.

1783
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:21,880
Can we...

1784
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:23,780
I think we just try to kill them, honestly.

1785
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:27,740
I'm down to push whenever.

1786
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:29,720
They're going back to that one spot.

1787
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:30,680
Yeah, they're going back to you.

1788
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:31,880
Tell me, tell me.

1789
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:33,100
Flash?

1790
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:37,480
Oh shit, you guys are...

1791
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,000
Nice, good, dude.

1792
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:39,500
They're hard pushing, they're hard pushing.

1793
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,940
I'm really far, though.

1794
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:43,540
I'm throwing nades.

1795
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:48,900
I'm peeking inside of this room here.

1796
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,740
I hit nothing with my nades.

1797
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,440
Watch that castle, watch that castle.

1798
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:00,180
I'm batting.

1799
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:01,400
Yeah, you're good.

1800
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:02,280
Oh my god.

1801
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:03,240
I got one.

1802
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:03,940
He'll be down.

1803
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:04,700
On me.

1804
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:05,900
Castle one, castle one.

1805
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,440
I think a new team.

1806
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,240
Come inside the truck, come inside the truck if you can.

1807
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,420
I need heal, I need heal.

1808
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,720
It's just a pathfinder, it's just a pathfinder.

1809
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,020
Okay.

1810
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:16,860
I think that's the last guy.

1811
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,520
Is that the last guy?

1812
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:18,360
Yeah, I don't think it's a new team.

1813
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:18,840
I think we're good.

1814
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:19,880
Okay, thank god.

1815
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,620
I wasn't sure.

1816
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,780
Wait, there's a new team to our right, though.

1817
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:25,340
Yeah, yeah.

1818
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:26,280
We can kill them, too.

1819
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,260
They're not pushing, they're not pushing.

1820
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:31,570
I am...

1821
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:33,270
I'm just listening to the calls of my leader.

1822
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:36,290
Oh my god, get me in there.

1823
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:36,690
I think we're chilling.

1824
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:37,950
I need to get in there.

1825
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:39,130
Try and scan around, make sure no one's on us.

1826
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:40,970
I need energy.

1827
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:43,390
Here, I have...

1828
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:44,070
I dropped some.

1829
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:44,610
Thank you.

1830
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:46,750
Thank you for donating to the poor.

1831
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:49,670
VTubers.

1832
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:53,350
I think that was the pathfinder.

1833
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:55,590
I think that was the team that...

1834
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:57,370
That was just one pathfinder left.

1835
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:57,970
She lost the zip.

1836
01:09:58,050 --> 01:09:58,570
She lost the zip.

1837
01:09:58,610 --> 01:09:59,150
Here, look at this, look at this.

1838
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:00,190
Two left, two left.

1839
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:00,690
Last one, last one.

1840
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:05,370
I remember 100, you can still kill this guy.

1841
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:08,770
He's cracked, but...

1842
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:09,710
Can't get the last shot.

1843
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:10,750
He jumped off an...

1844
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,050
Kill this guy, kill this guy, kill this guy.

1845
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:13,490
How many kills?

1846
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:15,710
Flash, flash, flash, flash.

1847
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:17,210
Good job.

1848
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:20,350
Does he have energy?

1849
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:21,350
I'm good, backing up a bit.

1850
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:23,290
Does he have energy?

1851
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:24,110
No, he has no energy, he has no energy.

1852
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:24,990
No.

1853
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:27,850
I'm gonna get a kill.

1854
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:31,450
You can maybe kill that duo now, there's a duo in the middle of the map.

1855
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:32,890
It's cool.

1856
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:33,890
There's a hemlock here if you want to swap.

1857
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:35,430
Yeah, I'm gonna swap, fuck it.

1858
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:36,350
There's no point.

1859
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:39,970
It's 53, 53.

1860
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:43,750
I'm looking to peek on these guys over here.

1861
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:46,330
Yeah, if you see that duo, let me know, I might be able to kill him.

1862
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:48,910
They're pushing over there.

1863
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:54,950
Gibby's really low.

1864
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:56,790
They domed.

1865
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:00,410
I'm looking at him.

1866
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:04,250
The dome's gonna get... they're running now.

1867
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:05,730
Wait, there's someone close to us, no?

1868
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:07,350
Nevermind.

1869
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:11,370
They ran off, they ran down.

1870
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:12,190
Nice kill.

1871
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:14,250
They're gonna rez.

1872
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:16,290
Yeah, they're gonna rez, that's fine, I can't do anything about that.

1873
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:19,030
Where do we go?

1874
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:20,530
It's a little risky.

1875
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:22,370
There's a team right here that's crossing now.

1876
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:23,430
That's getting shot at.

1877
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:26,450
We're getting shot at right here.

1878
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:27,850
I have an Evo.

1879
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,590
Blue armor, blue armor, this team, full team, blue armor.

1880
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:33,150
Cracked them.

1881
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:36,790
We need to go far away right now, I think.

1882
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:37,430
We need to go far away right now.

1883
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:37,850
Come, come, come.

1884
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:38,490
You want me to Evo?

1885
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:39,610
Or Evo?

1886
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:40,970
Nope, nope, just follow me, we're gonna walk it.

1887
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:41,710
Alright.

1888
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:43,630
We're gonna mirror this team on the right here.

1889
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:44,610
Okay.

1890
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:50,410
And if we can't end up killing them, we might have to just take an Evo back.

1891
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:52,550
Yeah, just let me know when you want to pop.

1892
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:57,290
We can also just run and kill that blue armor team.

1893
01:11:57,370 --> 01:11:58,190
Except if you said they're on blue, we can definitely kill them.

1894
01:11:58,270 --> 01:11:59,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're on blue.

1895
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:01,730
Walk up to the other, there might be a team in front of us.

1896
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:02,490
Get ready to slam them instantly.

1897
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:07,410
They had a fucking... shotgun bullet.

1898
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,030
Get ready to peek the other shore, we might insta-kill one here.

1899
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:11,370
They're gonna be in front of us.

1900
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:14,710
There's two seconds behind.

1901
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:15,770
3, 2, 1.

1902
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:17,790
One shot, one shot.

1903
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:18,470
Dead.

1904
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:19,330
One more.

1905
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:21,570
Man, I hate the triple take.

1906
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:22,150
Nice.

1907
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:22,570
Finish.

1908
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:23,730
You wanna swap?

1909
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:26,990
Alright, listen, we're gonna kill this team on the left here, there's a blue armor team.

1910
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:28,890
Wait, he's still on the thing right there.

1911
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:29,790
Yeah, then shoot him.

1912
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:31,750
Come to my side, come to my side, we're gonna kill this team here.

1913
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:32,930
Alright, coming.

1914
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:33,350
Come to me, come to me.

1915
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:35,130
We're fighting these guys to the right, but I'm coming.

1916
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:36,070
Okay, I'm coming over too.

1917
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:38,930
They walled, they walled, wait, they're pushing us, they're pushing us, they're spraying us!

1918
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:39,610
You gotta throw bubble up here.

1919
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:40,230
I am, I'm pushing.

1920
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:44,850
Okay, listen, we need to walk up to your Q, okay?

1921
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:46,210
They're pushing, they're pushing, they're pushing!

1922
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:47,110
Okay.

1923
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:49,830
Okay, I'm coming.

1924
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:51,430
He's no armor.

1925
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:52,050
Oh!

1926
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:53,090
Shoot.

1927
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:54,510
That was a duo, right?

1928
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:55,270
Yeah, yeah.

1929
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:57,970
Yeah, we were pushing them, but then we came to go to you.

1930
01:12:58,190 --> 01:12:58,470
Yeah.

1931
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:00,050
Dang, I didn't think they'd come back.

1932
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:02,470
I didn't think they would come back too, yeah.

1933
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:05,510
That's why I was, like, shielding.

1934
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:08,070
I was looking at him, but I think it was too late.

1935
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:14,870
That's so ballsy, like, what are they doing?

1936
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:17,490
That's so ballsy of them to just push!

1937
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:21,990
If we're lucky, we might still get third, like, we might have the third most amount of points.

1938
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:24,590
That's true, but the other teams...

1939
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:27,590
Why did they push that?

1940
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:28,630
That's so aggressive.

1941
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:32,450
If they're doing traditional LGS scoring, we just got 12 points.

1942
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:37,590
And usually a third place team doesn't actually get that many points, so we might actually still end up getting some prize below that.

1943
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:38,430
Nice.

1944
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:40,950
Yeah, I can't believe they pushed that.

1945
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:41,610
I was like...

1946
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:41,750
Yeah.

1947
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:44,010
I had a feeling they were going to push it.

1948
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:48,370
Because, like, you know, they got me super low.

1949
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:53,330
I don't know what team that was.

1950
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:55,430
That was very surprising.

1951
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:58,330
I got shot in me ass.

1952
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:02,250
It's alright.

1953
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:04,550
We can get them on...

1954
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:07,610
Well, we know we can fight a lot of these teams in general.

1955
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:08,970
Oh, yeah.

1956
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:11,330
Yeah, now we know the skill level.

1957
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:16,380
Yeah, maybe we'll look at them.

1958
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,920
We'll get a third here.

1959
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,740
And not a lot of teams have kills.

1960
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:23,380
In general.

1961
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:25,280
Yeah, we basically...

1962
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:26,400
Well, the next...

1963
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,480
Well, to be fair, a lot of them were pushing us.

1964
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,740
The game mode after this is kill race.

1965
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:31,820
Is it kill race?

1966
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:32,440
Oh, really?

1967
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:33,140
Oh, that's good practice.

1968
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:35,940
The one that's going to die is so fast.

1969
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:36,820
Yeah.

1970
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:40,120
That's really...

1971
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,480
Wait, what map is the next one?

1972
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,060
Do we know?

1973
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:46,680
I don't know map.

1974
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:48,280
It doesn't say in the little info thing.

1975
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:49,740
They're just like...

1976
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,540
You know, I feel like this map today.

1977
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,300
Kill race seems like a fun game mode.

1978
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,080
Yeah, for the people who can...

1979
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,440
For the teams that have like...

1980
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,460
Apex players.

1981
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:00,780
Yeah.

1982
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:00,860
Yeah.

1983
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:07,120
Other teams are literally praying.

1984
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:14,190
Some of these teams are pretty stacked.

1985
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:15,210
Yeah.

1986
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:17,190
I mean, some of these teams literally have two pros.

1987
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:18,490
So, it's like...

1988
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:23,590
And some teams have like one pro and then two non-Apex players.

1989
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:24,730
So, it's like really weird.

1990
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:27,430
There goes pineapple pizza.

1991
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:28,630
Pineapple pizza!

1992
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:28,970
No!

1993
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:29,690
Five!

1994
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:30,010
Five!

1995
01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:33,650
Which team is this?

1996
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:34,810
I can't see names.

1997
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:35,770
This is streamer mode.

1998
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:38,430
This is LGLGS mode.

1999
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:42,470
Oh, this is Zero's team.

2000
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:43,350
Zero.

2001
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:52,910
This team doesn't have a lot of kills either.

2002
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:55,710
Three, four, five, six.

2003
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:56,750
They have six kills.

2004
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:58,790
Most likely, they might be first.

2005
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:17,210
Yeah, they have six kills plus fifth place.

2006
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:20,930
So, if they get one more kill, it messes up.

2007
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:21,810
So, they kind of have to die here.

2008
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:22,970
Okay.

2009
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:24,330
Wait, someone killed them now.

2010
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:24,950
Someone.

2011
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:26,090
We're stream sniping them.

2012
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,750
Their location is here.

2013
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:31,310
Oh, it's end zone.

2014
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:32,110
Wait, five teams?

2015
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:33,150
No, they're in a really good spot.

2016
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:33,710
They're not going to die.

2017
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:34,730
Five teams?

2018
01:16:34,730 --> 01:16:35,050
No!

2019
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:36,550
Where are they?

2020
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:38,590
Oh, yeah.

2021
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:39,090
This team is...

2022
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:40,850
Oh, and they're working those guys.

2023
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:41,330
Goodbye.

2024
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:42,350
Yep, they're...

2025
01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:43,730
Yep, they passed us.

2026
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:48,370
I think this team might get first, honestly.

2027
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:51,470
Yeah, they'll probably end up winning this.

2028
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:52,170
They're in a really good spot.

2029
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:53,630
Yeah, they have a really good spot there.

2030
01:16:59,110 --> 01:17:00,290
The other teams are about to kill each other.

2031
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:02,910
Oh, they're taking the balloon, that team.

2032
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:05,490
Oh, they're aiming for second.

2033
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:12,900
Wait, they're just cycling the zipline up top.

2034
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,080
Nobody's shooting them, too.

2035
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:18,340
They're too confused.

2036
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,200
Where the hell's the last guy?

2037
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,040
Is it just a solo?

2038
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,040
Oh, they're fighting.

2039
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:25,620
Oh.

2040
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,040
Ow.

2041
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,100
Oh, Zero's team won!

2042
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:40,980
Yeah!

2043
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,160
That was a very, like... what's the word?

2044
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:50,900
Anti-climatic, like... endgame.

2045
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:52,920
It was not very exciting.

2046
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:54,980
I know, compared to what we just had, the hide-and-seek endgame.

2047
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,900
There's 60 people jumping around.

2048
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:02,060
Dude, I feel like half the lobby died before the first zone.

2049
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:12,030
They just literally just walked up and won.

2050
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:17,170
Alright, how many kill points did the other team get?

2051
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:19,910
Seven?

2052
01:18:20,290 --> 01:18:20,650
Whoa.

2053
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:24,960
We got nine.

2054
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:28,020
Oh, but then team eight has nine kills, so...

2055
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:30,380
We got 12, so 12 plus...

2056
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:34,600
Yeah, but team eight has nine kills.

2057
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,680
We tie in third with the third place team, so we tie.

2058
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,400
Oh, but what about... Oh!

2059
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:42,140
I don't know who gets priority.

2060
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:44,000
We had more kills, but they had higher placement.

2061
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:44,640
I don't know how that works.

2062
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:46,580
Probably placement.

2063
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:52,380
We got 12 points, and the team that got third place emotional damage, they got 12 points as well.

2064
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:55,420
Yeah, but then our kills were cooler.

2065
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,440
Nobody else got 12 points other than team three.

2066
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:01,000
And team one and two, obviously.

2067
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,380
Yeah, let's start a riot if they don't split it with us.

2068
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,060
I went to tiebreaker.

2069
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:05,700
That's not going to work.

2070
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:06,600
Do we win?

2071
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:07,060
Come on.

2072
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:08,800
I think they win because they get higher placement.

2073
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,060
That's usually how ALGS does it.

2074
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,520
That should be illegal.

2075
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:14,920
I agree.

2076
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:19,060
Kills are cooler than placement.

2077
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,580
Placement is way too boring.

2078
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,060
How long until the next game starts?

2079
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,020
Do I load up web phishing?

2080
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:25,420
Alright, what's the code?

2081
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:26,340
What is this game?

2082
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,060
Web phishing?

2083
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:27,260
Web phishing?

2084
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:27,800
It's free!

2085
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:28,800
It's just phishing.

2086
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:29,540
It's not free, right?

2087
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,180
I don't remember.

2088
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,060
It is free.

2089
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:31,800
Oh, it is free.

2090
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,480
You get to fish with other people.

2091
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,680
Other cool cats and dogs.

2092
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:37,040
Yeah.

2093
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,660
Like one of those .io games, like a website game?

2094
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:41,880
No, you gotta download it on Steam.

2095
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:43,260
It's not free, sure.

2096
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,220
It's like $7 or something.

2097
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:46,280
$5.

2098
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:50,360
Oh, yeah, it's $7 Canadian dollars because our money is paper money.

2099
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,420
Alright, what's the code?

2100
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,160
I'm freaking loading it up.

2101
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,740
What is the fucking code?

2102
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:06,100
MX88PA MX88?

2103
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,380
Yep, 88PA.

2104
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:08,960
PA.

2105
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:09,820
Alright, I'm in.

2106
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:16,470
It's web phishing time, guys.

2107
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:17,630
Guys, it's R18.

2108
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:18,710
Remember what that means?

2109
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:20,590
ERP.

2110
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:22,310
It's time to ERP, guys.

2111
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:27,950
Hey, guys.

2112
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:29,970
Are we going to the docks?

2113
01:20:32,570 --> 01:20:34,130
But I don't want ERP.

2114
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:34,910
It's too late.

2115
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,210
You clicked agree, guys.

2116
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:39,590
You know this is an R18 server.

2117
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:41,990
I always go to the docks.

2118
01:20:44,690 --> 01:20:46,470
Yeah, but last time...

2119
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:49,790
But this time, this is Sureforce server and he loves ERP.

2120
01:20:50,530 --> 01:20:52,610
That's why he creates these servers for people.

2121
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:57,910
Oh, Gibraltar's banned, apparently.

2122
01:20:58,090 --> 01:20:59,110
We can't play Gibby anymore.

2123
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:01,810
Ooh, did they post a ban?

2124
01:21:01,810 --> 01:21:02,930
I don't know.

2125
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:04,170
Someone in my chat said it.

2126
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:06,770
Oh, Newcastle, Gibby, and Lifeline are bad.

2127
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:08,110
When do we play?

2128
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:12,190
Newcastle, Gibby, Lifeline?

2129
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:12,610
Okay.

2130
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:14,810
What is the...

2131
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:17,330
next rule set?

2132
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:17,730
Let's see.

2133
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:23,820
Does anyone have a guitar?

2134
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:25,380
Can anyone play us some music?

2135
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:27,800
Someone might have one.

2136
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,860
Any guitarists here?

2137
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:36,320
Any guitarists?

2138
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:40,060
No musically inclined fishers?

2139
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,500
What are you guys' best characters, what do you say?

2140
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:45,580
You're the Apex pro.

2141
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I can do Bangalore and...

2142
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:57,060
For a while, I did Rampart and only griefed people with a charge rifle when it was hits.

2143
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:59,500
Oh yeah, I remember that era of Sureforce.

2144
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:02,880
Oh shit, I got an octopus.

2145
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:04,480
Octopussy.

2146
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:05,480
Look at that.

2147
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,040
Have either of you played Thieves?

2148
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:11,480
I played them like two or three times.

2149
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:20,660
I can play Pathy, Wraith, Bangalore, Catalyst, Conduit.

2150
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,780
I think we just do Bang, Horizon, Pathfinder.

2151
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:27,180
I can do Path.

2152
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,000
I can do Bangalore, yeah.

2153
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:29,440
Pathfinder?

2154
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:30,580
I'll do Bang.

2155
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:35,640
Is the goal to just instantly kill everybody?

2156
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:36,300
Yeah.

2157
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:37,820
We're gonna run them down.

2158
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,580
We run them down or we die, that's it.

2159
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:43,980
Or would you rather play Pathfinder or Doki?

2160
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:46,400
No, I'd rather prefer Bangalore.

2161
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:49,360
I don't like Path's new hitbox anyway.

2162
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:50,720
Yeah, he's pretty big.

2163
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:55,070
Nice.

2164
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:55,750
What did I get?

2165
01:22:56,690 --> 01:22:57,750
I got a soda can.

2166
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:01,070
Oh my god, and there's money in there.

2167
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:03,430
Why is there money in the soda can?

2168
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:06,030
I don't know, maybe like, if it's for good luck.

2169
01:23:06,510 --> 01:23:08,570
I basically yoink somebody's luck from the sea.

2170
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:09,710
What?

2171
01:23:11,490 --> 01:23:14,410
Wait, there's two game threes in this infographic.

2172
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:15,090
I see.

2173
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:17,570
What game are we playing next?

2174
01:23:18,510 --> 01:23:19,270
It's Kill Race.

2175
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:20,790
Is it Kill Race next?

2176
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:23,990
You can boot up a second PC, we're playing both games at the same time.

2177
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:24,550
Yeah.

2178
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:25,530
Oh, true, true.

2179
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:28,050
We basically clone ourselves and then go to a different lobby.

2180
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:31,830
Any team that eliminates Team Gamerselves will earn $250 bounty.

2181
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:33,510
Whoa, where are they landing?

2182
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:34,310
Let's get a drop spot.

2183
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:36,690
Oh wait, the drop spots are being called right now.

2184
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:40,010
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

2185
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:40,850
Baits from Cohen Heights.

2186
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:42,170
Please tell me nobody called it.

2187
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:43,270
I think we got it.

2188
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,390
Oh no, I don't have any bait.

2189
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:47,030
Can anyone donate some bait for me?

2190
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:48,630
No.

2191
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:50,970
Can anyone send me some letters?

2192
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:52,190
No.

2193
01:23:52,290 --> 01:23:53,030
With bait in there?

2194
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:54,250
I'm not talking about you, Surefour.

2195
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:56,090
I'm talking about the people in my...

2196
01:23:56,090 --> 01:23:56,690
Oh, Alan!

2197
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:59,130
I know you, you're from my stream.

2198
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:00,750
Give me some bait.

2199
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:03,190
Well, my viewer said, not a dog.

2200
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:04,010
Dirty dog.

2201
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:05,170
Whoa!

2202
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:09,790
Alright, if you're a dragoon, swap to a dog.

2203
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:12,550
We're having a dog versus cat war.

2204
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:14,590
I can kick anyone in this game.

2205
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:15,450
Alright, you guys pick your characters.

2206
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:16,290
We're about to load here.

2207
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:17,330
Oh shit, okay.

2208
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:17,850
Oh shit.

2209
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:19,870
You're on Bangalore.

2210
01:24:20,110 --> 01:24:21,030
I got Bang, yeah.

2211
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:23,230
And you're on Horizon.

2212
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:23,690
Horizon.

2213
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:24,690
Yeah.

2214
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:25,770
Oh shit, where's Bangalore?

2215
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:26,570
Oh, there she is.

2216
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:27,470
Top left, top left.

2217
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:30,570
Alright guys.

2218
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:33,330
We're just going to all land on the rooftop.

2219
01:24:33,890 --> 01:24:34,330
Alright, cool.

2220
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:38,090
Yeah, I don't know if Surefour has.

2221
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:40,070
I'll have to look when I load in.

2222
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:42,990
He's still fishing.

2223
01:24:43,530 --> 01:24:44,390
Oh, never mind, he's gone.

2224
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:49,550
Listen, we're about to three man land on a rooftop and another team might literally land on this rooftop with us.

2225
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:50,770
And we're just going to pick up a gun and just do it without.

2226
01:24:51,150 --> 01:24:51,510
Gulp.

2227
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:53,070
Oh my god, you're right.

2228
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:55,170
Surefour is willing to kick dogs?

2229
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:56,770
Damn, that's fucked.

2230
01:24:57,330 --> 01:24:58,190
And I'd do it again.

2231
01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:01,570
Alright, we're going right here to this building.

2232
01:25:02,090 --> 01:25:03,550
Can't see it, it's on my ping right there.

2233
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:04,510
We're going to that rooftop.

2234
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:04,870
Alright.

2235
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:06,410
Oh, match ended.

2236
01:25:06,690 --> 01:25:07,190
Alright, match ended.

2237
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:09,190
Yeah, I guess I should just...

2238
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:12,250
You should what?

2239
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:14,750
Low tier god.

2240
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:19,630
Scrims!

2241
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:21,450
I love scrims!

2242
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:28,980
Low tier god.

2243
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:36,940
We wait.

2244
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,520
We fucking wait.

2245
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:45,590
Oh, someone picked one of the banned characters, I guess.

2246
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:46,670
Oh.

2247
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:49,390
They're really spamming that.

2248
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:51,030
Just so everyone knows.

2249
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:55,450
Bam, Newcastle Gibraltar lifeline.

2250
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:58,150
Oh, a VTuber did it.

2251
01:25:58,250 --> 01:25:59,050
I knew it.

2252
01:25:59,070 --> 01:25:59,570
It was Reinho.

2253
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,600
Who was it?

2254
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:09,460
Exposed him!

2255
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:10,960
Call him out to the world!

2256
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,180
It was Reinho.

2257
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:16,070
She said she was alt-tabbed and then x3'd.

2258
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:18,800
Damn.

2259
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,080
Kick her out.

2260
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,600
Any OG Seers?

2261
01:26:31,630 --> 01:26:33,030
Alright, starting now.

2262
01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:35,210
Are you an OG Seer or an OBG Seer?

2263
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:36,750
An OG Seer?

2264
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:38,050
An OBG Seer?

2265
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:39,430
Yeah.

2266
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:41,550
What is that?

2267
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:46,170
Have someone post it in your chat and then look at it.

2268
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:49,650
OGC, OBGC?

2269
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:52,650
OGC, OBGC.

2270
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:57,570
Guys, what does that mean?

2271
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:02,310
It looks like someone playing with their thang.

2272
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:03,070
What?

2273
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:06,710
Yeah.

2274
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:08,230
OGC.

2275
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:11,610
Guys, nobody is posting it!

2276
01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:13,930
Oh, your chat is lame.

2277
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:17,230
Is that like a boomer thang?

2278
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:19,450
No, it's not a boomer thang.

2279
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:21,030
Is that a boomer thang?

2280
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:23,690
It's not a boomer thang, bro.

2281
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:27,630
It's lowercase OGC, capitalized.

2282
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:32,540
I see it.

2283
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:33,860
I relinquished.

2284
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:34,940
I see it.

2285
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:35,920
I can see it now.

2286
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,220
I'm going to do a test here.

2287
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:38,980
Alright.

2288
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:39,100
Alright.

2289
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:43,520
This is a really far flight path.

2290
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:45,060
We might not even make the roof here.

2291
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:49,040
I believe in your ability to stretch.

2292
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:50,020
Yeah, I believe in you.

2293
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,580
Because we're just going to stick to you until we make it.

2294
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:53,820
This is West Coast server.

2295
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,860
Fuck EU players, I guess.

2296
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:59,640
Trifor, you're going to land on the left side of the roof and grab a gunspawn.

2297
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,260
Doki, you're going to land on the close bin.

2298
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:02,680
There's a really close bin on the roof here.

2299
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:03,120
Are you going to land on that?

2300
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:03,320
Okay.

2301
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:04,120
I'm going to go to the right.

2302
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,540
I'm on the left side.

2303
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:06,220
Yep.

2304
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,820
I don't see anyone here, though.

2305
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:08,820
I think we're good.

2306
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:09,640
Yeah, I think we're good, actually.

2307
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,740
I don't think nobody landed on this.

2308
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:14,900
Doki, you can go left here.

2309
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:15,300
Okay.

2310
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,120
Trifor, you go to the right.

2311
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:17,120
Just leave all these buildings on the right.

2312
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,320
Does placement count in this, or is it literally just kills?

2313
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:21,540
It's just kills, I think.

2314
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:22,120
Okay.

2315
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:27,660
I'm going to hit this man scan here, and we're just going to go around to the closest team.

2316
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:28,560
Alright.

2317
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:32,900
Whoa, people are fighting!

2318
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:42,360
Holy shit, so many people are fighting.

2319
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:43,120
I know.

2320
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:44,700
What is going on?

2321
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:47,640
We're just going to get one kill and inserted.

2322
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,540
Oh, two scrubs, one pro dead.

2323
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:51,140
That's the team that killed us.

2324
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:52,440
No, that's not.

2325
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:52,900
That's not.

2326
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:53,500
We killed them.

2327
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:02,620
They literally have like three teams that's like the same name, but like worded differently.

2328
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:10,860
A lot of fighting.

2329
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:11,880
Wow.

2330
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:14,780
Can we kill farm?

2331
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:16,860
That's the plan.

2332
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:18,160
Are we going to respawn farm somebody?

2333
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:21,040
Yeah, yeah, we spawn farm them.

2334
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:22,580
Who's bad enough, you think?

2335
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:26,080
Yeah, like we'll just leave one person alive every time.

2336
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,020
And then follow them.

2337
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:32,120
This is why kill races started not being popular, guys.

2338
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:35,820
All people did was kill farm.

2339
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:41,170
I don't know if you see a nemesis or a flatline.

2340
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:42,650
I got a nemesis.

2341
01:29:42,650 --> 01:29:44,990
Oh, there's a massive though.

2342
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:48,370
I hate the triple take.

2343
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:48,850
I'll take it.

2344
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,270
I know, I dropped the flatline earlier.

2345
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:52,890
You'll kill people with it.

2346
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:54,170
Thank you.

2347
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:55,790
Promise.

2348
01:29:56,790 --> 01:29:59,070
I can give you a vault, Surefour, if you want it.

2349
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:00,870
A what?

2350
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:02,330
I can give Surefour the vault.

2351
01:30:03,450 --> 01:30:04,690
And then I'll take the triple take.

2352
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:07,090
Make sure you grab the salt bin ducky when you're done.

2353
01:30:07,790 --> 01:30:09,330
Oh, they already killed the gamer sub team.

2354
01:30:09,450 --> 01:30:10,170
That was fast.

2355
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:12,310
No, our fight money!

2356
01:30:13,090 --> 01:30:14,610
Oh no, I have $250.

2357
01:30:16,390 --> 01:30:17,470
Oh, we don't have any evos.

2358
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:18,370
We need to get this evo together.

2359
01:30:18,610 --> 01:30:20,170
As soon as you get this assault bin...

2360
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:23,610
Let's go get this evo together as a team.

2361
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:30,710
Surefour, do you want the vault?

2362
01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:32,070
I got one.

2363
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:33,850
Oh, wait, where did you drop the triple take?

2364
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:36,190
He had the triple take.

2365
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:38,110
Oh, I thought you gave it to him.

2366
01:30:38,530 --> 01:30:39,690
No, he dropped the shotgun.

2367
01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:42,650
It's up here in front of the bin somewhere.

2368
01:30:42,650 --> 01:30:42,910
I see it.

2369
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:43,430
I see it.

2370
01:30:43,490 --> 01:30:44,350
I got it.

2371
01:30:45,230 --> 01:30:45,990
There's another nemesis here.

2372
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:46,630
Someone wants it.

2373
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:50,550
I got the triple take.

2374
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:52,310
I just need a scope for it.

2375
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:55,550
Alright, I told everybody we're here.

2376
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:57,810
I'm duck hunting.

2377
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:00,310
Alright, I'm gonna go hit this beacon real quick.

2378
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:02,650
And then if anyone's on this beacon...

2379
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:05,870
You want tactical cooldown or ultimate cooldown?

2380
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:08,570
Tactical.

2381
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:09,330
Alright.

2382
01:31:12,650 --> 01:31:14,170
Dang, we have nobody.

2383
01:31:14,410 --> 01:31:14,910
What?

2384
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:17,170
What the fuck, man?

2385
01:31:17,450 --> 01:31:17,870
What?

2386
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:19,650
What?

2387
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:20,970
That's so late.

2388
01:31:20,970 --> 01:31:22,530
That was so late.

2389
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:24,530
That's so late.

2390
01:31:24,530 --> 01:31:25,310
What happened?

2391
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:26,570
I don't know.

2392
01:31:26,630 --> 01:31:27,410
I'm taking a piss, bro.

2393
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:28,890
A teammate picked Lifeline.

2394
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:31,870
Somebody picked Lifeline.

2395
01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:33,850
It's we the people's team.

2396
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:37,530
But like, why did they restart so late?

2397
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:44,590
What?

2398
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:54,060
Wait, it's not we the people?

2399
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:54,940
What happened?

2400
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:55,960
What happened?

2401
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:56,860
Their team died and restarted.

2402
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,020
Look at the characters.

2403
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:00,720
Who did it?

2404
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:01,400
Who did it?

2405
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:04,560
I'm looking at we the people right now.

2406
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:05,080
I don't see anybody.

2407
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:05,660
Nobody did it.

2408
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,860
Yeah, nobody did it.

2409
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:08,220
Why did we restart?

2410
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,360
Literally, no one had it.

2411
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:18,520
Five people crashed.

2412
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:20,220
Two DCs.

2413
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,810
Five people crashed.

2414
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:25,490
Not me, so I don't care.

2415
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:28,910
I'm getting pissed off.

2416
01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:38,610
I think because it was a West Coast server, so I think maybe the EU players crashed or something.

2417
01:32:41,310 --> 01:32:42,830
I'm Alt-F4 and I'm OGC.

2418
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:47,910
Oh my god.

2419
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:49,950
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

2420
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:50,810
I'll be right back.

2421
01:32:53,690 --> 01:32:54,910
Do we save for them to wait?

2422
01:32:56,890 --> 01:32:58,070
Nah, fuck it, bro.

2423
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:03,210
A lot of teams are on conduit.

2424
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:03,930
It's not a bad pick.

2425
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:13,840
Do either of you like playing conduit?

2426
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:15,760
Which ones?

2427
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:16,680
The conduits?

2428
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,100
She gives shields.

2429
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:20,820
I've never played her.

2430
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:23,780
I could try her.

2431
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:25,560
You don't have to.

2432
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,800
If either of you guys like playing conduit, you can play her if you wanted to.

2433
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,440
But I think our comp's pretty dang good.

2434
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:43,880
Match starting in 4, 3, 2, 1.

2435
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,720
I almost want to just land next to somebody and just kill them right away.

2436
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:51,320
I feel like if we don't kill someone early, we kind of want to snowball.

2437
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:52,880
Hey, I'm down for anything.

2438
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:55,280
I might just have us land on Stadium and we just kill them.

2439
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,760
I don't know who's landing on Stadium.

2440
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:59,260
We haven't started yet!

2441
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,360
I went to the bathroom!

2442
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:02,540
It says starting server.

2443
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:03,700
Okay, now we start.

2444
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:05,940
Nice.

2445
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,380
I might just have us run at a team and grab a gun and just send to this team.

2446
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:11,640
Which one?

2447
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:13,240
The Stadium team?

2448
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:14,180
I don't know who's there, though.

2449
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,420
It might be a double-pro team.

2450
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:16,700
I don't know.

2451
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:18,340
It's okay.

2452
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,900
I'll say I crashed if we lose.

2453
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:21,920
Yeah, good call.

2454
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,500
Trick or treat, you're the same.

2455
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,040
Wait, what's happening?

2456
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:27,080
If we lose, I crash?

2457
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:28,680
Yeah, we'll be like...

2458
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:30,040
If we land on top of somebody and if we lose, yeah.

2459
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:30,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2460
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:32,520
We'll be like, sorry, I crashed.

2461
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:33,180
Can we restart?

2462
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:34,840
I'll just say I picked Lifeline.

2463
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:35,480
Yeah!

2464
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:38,940
They can see if you picked Lifeline!

2465
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,200
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

2466
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:40,820
They can't.

2467
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:42,740
Just say you have the newest skin on.

2468
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:44,180
It looks like you're not Lifeline.

2469
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:44,980
Yeah.

2470
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:48,240
It's a visual bug, but I was definitely on Lifeline.

2471
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:54,850
I crashed and ended up playing Lifeline.

2472
01:34:55,150 --> 01:34:56,570
My game looks fucking bugged, bro.

2473
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:57,570
Like, this is crazy.

2474
01:34:59,950 --> 01:35:01,170
Where are we landing then?

2475
01:35:02,710 --> 01:35:03,930
We're just gonna do the same thing, I think.

2476
01:35:04,830 --> 01:35:05,210
Alright.

2477
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:07,950
I don't remember where it was.

2478
01:35:08,010 --> 01:35:08,450
Was it here?

2479
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:09,650
Up here, yeah.

2480
01:35:12,370 --> 01:35:13,830
Don't split off yet until nobody's coming.

2481
01:35:18,730 --> 01:35:19,630
Doesn't look like it.

2482
01:35:19,810 --> 01:35:21,350
There's only one team to our right.

2483
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:23,570
So we're gonna push out.

2484
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:26,230
Every team landed far side.

2485
01:35:26,890 --> 01:35:27,850
By the looks of it.

2486
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:31,890
There's a team here, and there's a team behind us.

2487
01:35:33,730 --> 01:35:35,670
Yep, just try and loot fast, and we're gonna go.

2488
01:35:36,110 --> 01:35:38,930
Alright, going back to where I started.

2489
01:35:40,690 --> 01:35:42,510
Hope I get good shit.

2490
01:35:50,130 --> 01:35:51,630
Oh, there's a flatline here.

2491
01:35:52,390 --> 01:35:53,190
I probably got that.

2492
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:58,610
I'm gonna get the same guns that I had.

2493
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:01,370
I had a Mastiff and everything.

2494
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:25,200
Oh my god, I get worse guns.

2495
01:36:34,110 --> 01:36:35,450
Oh, nice, triple take.

2496
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:36,930
Okay, I got my triple take.

2497
01:36:41,950 --> 01:36:43,250
A lot of teams died earlier this time.

2498
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:45,250
I think everyone got a mole again.

2499
01:36:45,330 --> 01:36:46,710
They all learned their lesson.

2500
01:36:48,730 --> 01:36:50,250
Everyone was like...

2501
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:51,830
Everyone knows where to go now.

2502
01:36:52,870 --> 01:36:53,870
So you got the Assault Bend Duggy.

2503
01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:55,170
Behind the... maybe.

2504
01:36:56,650 --> 01:36:58,010
There's a Nemesis here too.

2505
01:36:58,890 --> 01:37:00,550
Do we have any Evos at all?

2506
01:37:00,870 --> 01:37:01,090
Nope.

2507
01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:04,150
Oh my god, we don't have anything.

2508
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:08,590
We're gonna blend together and get this Evo over here.

2509
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:15,350
I need a Mastiff.

2510
01:37:15,570 --> 01:37:18,110
I need a shotgun if anyone finds one.

2511
01:37:19,210 --> 01:37:19,510
Nope.

2512
01:37:20,430 --> 01:37:20,910
No?

2513
01:37:21,310 --> 01:37:21,710
Okay.

2514
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:23,110
Fuck me, I guess.

2515
01:37:23,450 --> 01:37:24,770
Who cares about what I want?

2516
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:26,830
Oh, I found a Mastiff.

2517
01:37:26,890 --> 01:37:27,270
Let's go.

2518
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:31,670
I'm here.

2519
01:37:34,190 --> 01:37:34,810
I'm here.

2520
01:37:38,270 --> 01:37:38,590
I'm here.

2521
01:37:38,590 --> 01:37:38,690
Where do we go?

2522
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:40,430
Just make sure you smoke right away.

2523
01:37:40,830 --> 01:37:41,110
Okay.

2524
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:43,090
Where are we going?

2525
01:37:44,790 --> 01:37:45,690
On the left here.

2526
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:49,110
There was a team that landed there.

2527
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:50,630
Oh, they're over there.

2528
01:37:52,030 --> 01:37:52,450
See them?

2529
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:54,730
No, I saw the little glowy thing.

2530
01:37:54,850 --> 01:37:54,990
See?

2531
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:56,130
Yeah, they just hit the map room.

2532
01:37:57,090 --> 01:37:57,810
I'm gonna get this Evo really quick.

2533
01:37:57,870 --> 01:37:58,590
I might end up fighting this team.

2534
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:02,290
I'm here with it.

2535
01:38:02,570 --> 01:38:03,270
Me too.

2536
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:05,390
And they saw us too.

2537
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:06,530
They're on the left here.

2538
01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:08,110
Yeah, we can maybe...

2539
01:38:08,110 --> 01:38:09,690
I don't know if we're gonna fight this actually.

2540
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:10,670
I shot him.

2541
01:38:12,770 --> 01:38:14,070
There's a guy to our right here too.

2542
01:38:16,670 --> 01:38:17,510
Track the bloodhound.

2543
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:18,870
Backing up.

2544
01:38:19,490 --> 01:38:22,110
I don't have an angle.

2545
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:22,490
Are they running?

2546
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:24,330
One of them did.

2547
01:38:25,830 --> 01:38:26,730
One guy far right.

2548
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:27,710
Just try and spread out here.

2549
01:38:28,850 --> 01:38:30,450
They're really spread by the way.

2550
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:32,210
There's another team to our right.

2551
01:38:32,270 --> 01:38:32,930
We need to go south.

2552
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:34,270
Go through the south choke right now.

2553
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:34,810
Just run through it.

2554
01:38:40,330 --> 01:38:41,130
Just keep running.

2555
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:41,930
Keep running all the way.

2556
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:46,350
We're gonna go hit this beacon over here.

2557
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:47,210
Okay.

2558
01:38:56,650 --> 01:38:57,950
They might keep chasing us.

2559
01:38:58,930 --> 01:38:59,730
I don't like that.

2560
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:01,650
I don't like that at all.

2561
01:39:03,310 --> 01:39:05,710
See, if we keep running, they'll think we're a weaker team.

2562
01:39:06,850 --> 01:39:08,230
And then we can stuff them.

2563
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:08,830
We can turn and burn.

2564
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:09,450
I like that idea.

2565
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:14,580
There's like...

2566
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,560
There's a lot of fighting over there actually.

2567
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:20,600
Oh, there is a lot.

2568
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:22,940
Should we go back?

2569
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:27,040
That's too many teams there.

2570
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:30,690
There's a team here.

2571
01:39:30,770 --> 01:39:31,170
There's a guy here.

2572
01:39:31,210 --> 01:39:31,690
We can kill that guy.

2573
01:39:32,350 --> 01:39:33,090
I'll be a solo.

2574
01:39:33,710 --> 01:39:35,310
I'm right behind you.

2575
01:39:35,870 --> 01:39:36,490
It's probably a solo.

2576
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:39,250
We're gonna hit this.

2577
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:39,970
We're gonna get the Evo.

2578
01:39:40,150 --> 01:39:41,650
Hit the man scan.

2579
01:39:42,370 --> 01:39:43,390
And then probably kill that guy.

2580
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:45,310
I'm gonna go hit it right away.

2581
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:47,190
How can there be a solo already?

2582
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:49,330
They died.

2583
01:39:50,030 --> 01:39:50,830
No way.

2584
01:39:52,630 --> 01:39:53,910
I'm getting your Evo right now.

2585
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:55,050
I'll come as fast as I can.

2586
01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:57,390
You go to Verhulst.

2587
01:39:57,430 --> 01:39:58,090
I'm getting Evo.

2588
01:40:01,690 --> 01:40:03,570
I'm still a little lagged.

2589
01:40:03,670 --> 01:40:05,690
Wait, the server is lagging.

2590
01:40:07,190 --> 01:40:08,310
That's life, isn't it?

2591
01:40:08,410 --> 01:40:09,670
I can't move!

2592
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:10,790
The server!

2593
01:40:11,410 --> 01:40:12,830
This guy Mirage ulted on me.

2594
01:40:13,030 --> 01:40:14,590
I don't know where he went though.

2595
01:40:15,530 --> 01:40:16,670
Watch out for you guys that are falling out of the ship, okay?

2596
01:40:20,670 --> 01:40:23,290
Guys, I got netcode.

2597
01:40:24,130 --> 01:40:24,730
I got...

2598
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:27,110
People DCing!

2599
01:40:27,110 --> 01:40:27,870
I'm not the only one.

2600
01:40:29,010 --> 01:40:29,530
Nice.

2601
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:31,190
I got another one.

2602
01:40:31,230 --> 01:40:32,250
Are you able to reconnect?

2603
01:40:32,690 --> 01:40:33,990
I don't think so.

2604
01:40:34,410 --> 01:40:35,990
Zero also DCed.

2605
01:40:36,050 --> 01:40:37,030
You can reconnect.

2606
01:40:39,470 --> 01:40:40,510
I'm initializing.

2607
01:40:41,010 --> 01:40:43,370
Cannot rejoin previous match!

2608
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:43,810
No!

2609
01:40:44,590 --> 01:40:45,190
Are you serious?

2610
01:40:45,550 --> 01:40:49,110
It looks like we're duoing this now.

2611
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:49,930
She's gone, bro.

2612
01:40:50,070 --> 01:40:51,550
I'm gone, gone!

2613
01:40:52,570 --> 01:40:54,310
It looks like we're duoing this shit, bro.

2614
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:54,610
No!

2615
01:40:56,910 --> 01:40:57,550
Duo here.

2616
01:40:57,970 --> 01:40:58,490
We should go kill that.

2617
01:40:59,370 --> 01:41:01,010
Guys, I'm sad.

2618
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:02,970
They're gonna run their way.

2619
01:41:03,030 --> 01:41:03,630
They're gonna go this way.

2620
01:41:05,210 --> 01:41:07,290
Guys, it's time to webfish, guys.

2621
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:09,470
We can kill that team.

2622
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:10,630
I'm gonna put a D-Vac down.

2623
01:41:10,710 --> 01:41:11,790
We just land on them.

2624
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:13,090
I'm down.

2625
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:15,950
Sad.

2626
01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:17,750
Did you get the finish on the guy you killed, Noct?

2627
01:41:18,050 --> 01:41:18,910
Yeah, I finished him.

2628
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:19,750
Nice.

2629
01:41:21,150 --> 01:41:21,430
I...

2630
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:23,430
Listen, we want to land close to them, but not on top of them.

2631
01:41:23,630 --> 01:41:24,030
They're right there.

2632
01:41:26,530 --> 01:41:27,930
They're to the left of you.

2633
01:41:28,030 --> 01:41:29,310
Yeah, I'm gonna land over here.

2634
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:31,630
I saw one guy behind the building.

2635
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:32,270
Did you see the other one?

2636
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:35,250
I saw one guy go into this building right there.

2637
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:36,650
Yeah, they're on the back side.

2638
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:41,180
One guy here.

2639
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:42,120
Sad.

2640
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:44,100
Can we kill this guy on the left here?

2641
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:45,220
Yeah, I'm coming.

2642
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:50,980
Alright, guys.

2643
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:51,920
It's time to fish.

2644
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:54,220
Right here.

2645
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:57,720
He's cracked on me.

2646
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:00,440
On this rock here by himself, I think.

2647
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:03,120
Is that Bendy?

2648
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:06,320
He's broke.

2649
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:07,680
He's like one shot.

2650
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:09,360
Where's my code?

2651
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:14,840
How do I find my code?

2652
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:16,440
That other person is probably hiding over there.

2653
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,360
Yeah, he probably is.

2654
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:20,700
I think multiple people deseed, so there's some teams with two players.

2655
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:25,690
Guys, how do I...

2656
01:42:25,690 --> 01:42:26,530
Where's the code?

2657
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:28,530
Oh.

2658
01:42:29,490 --> 01:42:30,730
Alright, here's the code.

2659
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:32,950
Here it is.

2660
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:35,410
He just called a moby.

2661
01:42:35,670 --> 01:42:36,110
Looking that way.

2662
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:38,370
We can maybe kill that guy again.

2663
01:42:38,590 --> 01:42:39,930
You better respawn on this team again.

2664
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:41,890
Do it.

2665
01:42:43,030 --> 01:42:45,090
You gotta do it.

2666
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:47,910
They just respawned again over here.

2667
01:42:48,030 --> 01:42:48,850
They're too far though.

2668
01:42:50,350 --> 01:42:50,930
Alright, guys.

2669
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:53,210
Another guy might just be fucking hiding over here still.

2670
01:42:53,210 --> 01:42:54,510
Yeah, he could be.

2671
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:56,290
Let's go fish.

2672
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:58,630
I think one went right and one guy went left.

2673
01:42:59,990 --> 01:43:01,350
It's fishing time.

2674
01:43:01,950 --> 01:43:02,550
Dogs only.

2675
01:43:02,630 --> 01:43:03,930
If you're a cat, I'm kicking you out.

2676
01:43:04,570 --> 01:43:05,090
What the fuck?

2677
01:43:06,690 --> 01:43:08,310
I see you're a cat.

2678
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:10,990
I need a heavy mag.

2679
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:11,770
Alright.

2680
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:13,490
Get out.

2681
01:43:17,010 --> 01:43:18,290
Let's just run around and look for kills.

2682
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:19,710
I'm down.

2683
01:43:26,330 --> 01:43:26,810
I'm down.

2684
01:43:27,010 --> 01:43:28,630
I have triple take car.

2685
01:43:30,350 --> 01:43:31,490
Very interesting loadout.

2686
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:34,830
If you're a cat in my lobby...

2687
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:39,870
See, if you were a cat player, you wouldn't have gotten DC'd.

2688
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:42,970
Prove that you're a dog right now.

2689
01:43:43,410 --> 01:43:46,130
Change to a dog right now if you're a cat in my lobby.

2690
01:43:46,570 --> 01:43:47,290
I'm gonna cut the makeup.

2691
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:51,620
Boi.

2692
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:52,440
Boi.

2693
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:58,420
Okay, all you have to do guys to change is you go to customize right here.

2694
01:43:58,420 --> 01:43:59,980
Let's go hit this beacon over here.

2695
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,020
Yeah, you're gonna get web fishing comms.

2696
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:05,360
Okay, I should mute myself.

2697
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:07,600
Clear comms.

2698
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:09,240
Okay, alright.

2699
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:16,100
If you're a cat, you go to backpack and then you go customize and you pick a dog.

2700
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:21,280
If you do not swap to a dog right now, I'm gonna fucking kick you out.

2701
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:23,840
Alright, good.

2702
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:24,720
Dogs only!

2703
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:25,760
Dogs only!

2704
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,380
Alright, there you go.

2705
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:30,880
Let's go.

2706
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:33,060
Alright.

2707
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:35,160
It's a dog only world.

2708
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:37,460
Sorry.

2709
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:39,500
Right bow.

2710
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:42,720
If you are not a dog, right bow?

2711
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:45,780
I'm already mad.

2712
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:47,540
Don't make me angrier.

2713
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:49,700
Don't make me angrier.

2714
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:54,120
I can't even play the fucking game.

2715
01:44:56,980 --> 01:45:00,000
I was looking forward to killing.

2716
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:04,720
We cannot restart this current.

2717
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:07,120
We cannot restart this current match due to time constraints.

2718
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,160
Then why didn't you restart last game?

2719
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:10,380
We wanna look for the duos.

2720
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:12,640
We're like one of the only duos right now.

2721
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:14,040
Probably.

2722
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:15,580
The other ones probably died.

2723
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:17,340
That's not good.

2724
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:20,300
That's so bullshit.

2725
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:21,120
It is.

2726
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:23,240
That's why I'm fishing my pain away.

2727
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:24,500
Oh, I still don't have bait.

2728
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:30,660
The third party specialty.

2729
01:45:30,900 --> 01:45:33,140
This custom is like so cursed.

2730
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:34,360
I feel bad for the organizers.

2731
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:36,100
Like literally people were dropping.

2732
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:40,960
Literally they got players like five minutes before.

2733
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:45,000
They had to get players five minutes before the tournament was supposed to start.

2734
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,180
That's how cursed it was.

2735
01:45:52,050 --> 01:45:55,790
Like I got swapped pro players like four to five times.

2736
01:45:55,930 --> 01:46:15,350
I was talking about it earlier but originally I was supposed to get sweet and then I and then it was it was sweet then waltzy then reps then enemy and then we got for host like three hours before the custom was supposed to start.

2737
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:18,350
I had no idea like who the fuck was gonna be.

2738
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:21,450
The other person actually knew it was on my team was sure for it.

2739
01:46:22,330 --> 01:46:22,890
Little ambush.

2740
01:46:25,790 --> 01:46:27,330
No, Tempo isn't proud of organizing.

2741
01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:28,050
No.

2742
01:46:28,830 --> 01:46:31,330
It's like a whole different team of organizers.

2743
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:43,900
So it's like but I think it's like they're new to organizing Apex stuff.

2744
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:45,820
So like Apex tournaments and stuff.

2745
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:50,100
So it was like like people were like being drafted so late.

2746
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,940
Even though it's a kill thing.

2747
01:46:58,470 --> 01:46:59,830
Are you guys scared?

2748
01:47:00,290 --> 01:47:01,170
You guys are scared?

2749
01:47:02,090 --> 01:47:02,410
Nah.

2750
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:03,470
We're playing smart.

2751
01:47:04,190 --> 01:47:05,710
You guys are fucking scared.

2752
01:47:06,430 --> 01:47:06,770
No.

2753
01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:10,350
The dead can't speak by the way.

2754
01:47:11,170 --> 01:47:11,730
I'm fishing.

2755
01:47:12,190 --> 01:47:14,110
I'm technically alive because I'm fishing.

2756
01:47:16,470 --> 01:47:17,170
I'm fishing.

2757
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:17,670
I'm fishing right now.

2758
01:47:17,750 --> 01:47:18,530
I got a guppy.

2759
01:47:18,910 --> 01:47:20,230
You could be fishing right now.

2760
01:47:20,430 --> 01:47:21,130
It's like a bunch of duos alive.

2761
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:22,110
I just don't know where they are.

2762
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:24,430
There's a rez right there.

2763
01:47:25,130 --> 01:47:27,690
Oh, in front of us?

2764
01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:28,090
Over there?

2765
01:47:30,830 --> 01:47:31,690
Yeah, they're gonna kill us.

2766
01:47:32,990 --> 01:47:33,370
Should we look at this?

2767
01:47:34,010 --> 01:47:35,210
I'm here with you.

2768
01:47:36,570 --> 01:47:37,570
Give me a quiet while.

2769
01:47:37,870 --> 01:47:39,730
I'm inventing a new way of fishing.

2770
01:47:40,590 --> 01:47:41,630
I'm gonna go for the fan actually.

2771
01:47:43,450 --> 01:47:44,370
I'm gonna fin this guy.

2772
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:44,950
I'll come to you, okay?

2773
01:47:45,010 --> 01:47:48,130
I feel like I'm playing more web fishing than...

2774
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:58,550
I swear this stream has been like 80% web fishing than actually playing the fucking game.

2775
01:48:00,590 --> 01:48:01,210
They're almost dead over there.

2776
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:02,490
I think they're almost dead.

2777
01:48:04,210 --> 01:48:05,630
We're web fishing tournament.

2778
01:48:05,770 --> 01:48:07,490
This is a web fishing tournament right now.

2779
01:48:07,570 --> 01:48:09,570
Look, I got glistening small walleye.

2780
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:10,630
What a guy!

2781
01:48:12,290 --> 01:48:13,550
Where's my little guy?

2782
01:48:13,710 --> 01:48:15,290
I know I had one too.

2783
01:48:16,610 --> 01:48:17,690
There you go.

2784
01:48:18,790 --> 01:48:20,730
I put my little guy with you guys.

2785
01:48:22,110 --> 01:48:23,870
Look at that, all our little guys are together.

2786
01:48:24,890 --> 01:48:26,070
Oh, I can grow big!

2787
01:48:28,130 --> 01:48:31,010
I'm gonna be the biggest dog out there.

2788
01:48:32,530 --> 01:48:34,250
I'm gonna keep growing big.

2789
01:48:36,230 --> 01:48:37,150
He's one shot.

2790
01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:39,110
Keep growing big.

2791
01:48:40,330 --> 01:48:42,110
There's one to your left too.

2792
01:48:43,070 --> 01:48:45,470
It's just like the airline, whatever.

2793
01:48:46,490 --> 01:48:47,350
I don't know where he's at exactly.

2794
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:49,830
I heard him moving around.

2795
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:54,750
I think he's in middle stadium.

2796
01:48:55,410 --> 01:48:56,990
Oh, I got an alligator!

2797
01:48:57,350 --> 01:48:57,970
Look guys!

2798
01:49:00,170 --> 01:49:01,710
I want to see my gator.

2799
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:04,190
It's not euphemism for anything.

2800
01:49:05,350 --> 01:49:06,850
I never got my kill on that octane.

2801
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:08,490
I got that gator in me.

2802
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:15,040
How do I get this gator away from me?

2803
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:21,400
If I see any cat here...

2804
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:22,740
Oh my god, you're breakdancing!

2805
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:24,200
Oh shit!

2806
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:28,960
I don't think my team's gonna...

2807
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,580
It would be funny if I win money by web fishing.

2808
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:32,400
There's one behind you.

2809
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:32,920
There's one behind you.

2810
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:36,300
They're so fucking locked in.

2811
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:37,920
Guys, if I...

2812
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,520
If I see any cat in here, I'm gonna...

2813
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:40,780
No, that's not me.

2814
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:47,400
If I see any cat in here, I swear to god...

2815
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,320
Let's see...

2816
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:55,400
It's time to fish.

2817
01:49:58,250 --> 01:49:59,510
Wait, you can swim?

2818
01:50:01,410 --> 01:50:01,770
You can swim?

2819
01:50:01,770 --> 01:50:03,390
Yeah, I shot the guy on your cross.

2820
01:50:03,670 --> 01:50:06,130
Tidal only for people who got the super rare golden ray.

2821
01:50:06,310 --> 01:50:08,150
Wait, what's the super rare golden ray?

2822
01:50:13,090 --> 01:50:14,050
What is that?

2823
01:50:14,150 --> 01:50:15,230
Is that why you can swim?

2824
01:50:18,430 --> 01:50:19,270
Can I bait?

2825
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:21,050
Why is there no fish?

2826
01:50:21,130 --> 01:50:21,850
Oh, there it is.

2827
01:50:23,010 --> 01:50:24,550
Let's see, where the fuck is my fish?

2828
01:50:25,890 --> 01:50:26,990
We can play doki.

2829
01:50:30,030 --> 01:50:31,790
Wait, did you guys win?

2830
01:50:33,450 --> 01:50:33,930
Nah.

2831
01:50:34,430 --> 01:50:37,190
We got cut off running into zone and then got graybered.

2832
01:50:38,190 --> 01:50:39,930
How many kills did you guys get?

2833
01:50:40,990 --> 01:50:41,650
We got...

2834
01:50:42,330 --> 01:50:43,330
Six, I think.

2835
01:50:43,990 --> 01:50:47,390
Yeah, but do they have the kills though?

2836
01:50:48,290 --> 01:50:48,570
Yeah.

2837
01:50:49,330 --> 01:50:51,790
One person almost has as many kills as we have behind.

2838
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:53,030
Okay.

2839
01:50:54,550 --> 01:50:55,490
It's not fair!

2840
01:50:55,490 --> 01:50:58,490
This conduit has six kills.

2841
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:03,090
Multiple people crashed too, so it sucked.

2842
01:51:04,410 --> 01:51:06,070
That's fucking life, isn't it?

2843
01:51:06,810 --> 01:51:09,190
They probably didn't want to restart again.

2844
01:51:09,730 --> 01:51:10,390
No, they didn't.

2845
01:51:10,470 --> 01:51:12,630
Yeah, but they were willing to restart the last one.

2846
01:51:13,970 --> 01:51:15,950
Why did it have to be me?

2847
01:51:18,230 --> 01:51:19,590
Better you than me.

2848
01:51:20,130 --> 01:51:20,310
No.

2849
01:51:21,610 --> 01:51:21,870
Yeah.

2850
01:51:21,870 --> 01:51:24,470
No, Verhulst, who would you rather have on your team?

2851
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:25,150
Me or Surefour?

2852
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:27,450
I don't know.

2853
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:28,450
He's not gonna answer that.

2854
01:51:31,330 --> 01:51:33,270
But the answer is obviously me.

2855
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:34,270
No, it's not.

2856
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:37,470
If you make a poll right now, people will pick me over you.

2857
01:51:38,150 --> 01:51:39,550
Nah, my comms are pristine.

2858
01:51:39,890 --> 01:51:40,490
No, they're not.

2859
01:51:41,390 --> 01:51:42,090
Yeah, they are.

2860
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:45,190
I have better comms than you.

2861
01:51:45,430 --> 01:51:46,410
I actually play the game.

2862
01:51:46,470 --> 01:51:47,050
Oh, that's cap.

2863
01:51:47,330 --> 01:51:48,830
I actually play the game.

2864
01:51:48,990 --> 01:51:49,850
You don't even play the game.

2865
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:50,630
We came in third.

2866
01:51:50,850 --> 01:51:52,110
We came in third on kills.

2867
01:51:52,250 --> 01:51:53,070
Wait, we're third?

2868
01:51:54,010 --> 01:51:55,030
On kills, yeah.

2869
01:51:55,330 --> 01:51:57,150
Wait, then we...

2870
01:51:58,050 --> 01:51:58,510
Wait.

2871
01:51:59,290 --> 01:51:59,890
Then we win.

2872
01:51:59,890 --> 01:52:01,230
It's 13-16 and then 7.

2873
01:52:02,770 --> 01:52:03,970
Yeah, then we win.

2874
01:52:04,170 --> 01:52:05,850
Because like...

2875
01:52:05,850 --> 01:52:07,650
Because like it's all about the...

2876
01:52:07,650 --> 01:52:08,730
the kills.

2877
01:52:08,890 --> 01:52:09,570
It's not about placement.

2878
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:10,950
Yeah.

2879
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:11,370
Oh, you're right.

2880
01:52:11,430 --> 01:52:11,910
We get third.

2881
01:52:12,410 --> 01:52:13,370
Oh, let's go!

2882
01:52:13,850 --> 01:52:14,350
Let's go!

2883
01:52:15,150 --> 01:52:17,370
A fucking new web version, was it?

2884
01:52:17,950 --> 01:52:20,050
Why did she get a good job?

2885
01:52:20,130 --> 01:52:20,870
She did nothing!

2886
01:52:21,210 --> 01:52:21,770
Free money!

2887
01:52:24,090 --> 01:52:25,590
This is fucking bullshit.

2888
01:52:27,790 --> 01:52:28,750
Let's go!

2889
01:52:29,470 --> 01:52:30,550
I'm going non-verbal.

2890
01:52:31,330 --> 01:52:32,370
Let's fucking go!

2891
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:34,250
I got free money!

2892
01:52:35,310 --> 01:52:37,410
Okay, how do you...

2893
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:38,270
How do you...

2894
01:52:38,270 --> 01:52:41,090
How do you see like what placement we got?

2895
01:52:42,250 --> 01:52:43,330
The match summary?

2896
01:52:43,450 --> 01:52:44,910
But you had to like be in the match.

2897
01:52:45,270 --> 01:52:47,110
Yeah, but like I meant like...

2898
01:52:47,110 --> 01:52:48,950
Does Madden even say who wins?

2899
01:52:49,010 --> 01:52:50,710
Because we don't even know who won the last one.

2900
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:51,490
Because we tied.

2901
01:52:52,130 --> 01:52:54,310
I don't know if he's like marking it down somewhere or what.

2902
01:52:59,390 --> 01:53:00,670
I was going to say...

2903
01:53:00,670 --> 01:53:01,210
It's fine.

2904
01:53:01,330 --> 01:53:02,810
We got free money.

2905
01:53:03,290 --> 01:53:04,670
DC'd and I still win.

2906
01:53:05,730 --> 01:53:06,310
Look at that.

2907
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:08,610
Man, we could have had 20 kills that game.

2908
01:53:08,890 --> 01:53:10,170
Yeah, if I was alive.

2909
01:53:17,860 --> 01:53:18,400
No, guys.

2910
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:19,680
None of you guys can get a cut.

2911
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:20,720
You were not there.

2912
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:23,460
I wasn't there, but my name's on the team register.

2913
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:24,660
So they can't take me off.

2914
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:28,180
I'm petitioning to get your name off.

2915
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:29,280
You can't do that.

2916
01:53:30,780 --> 01:53:31,200
Yeah, I can.

2917
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:33,040
It's a free country.

2918
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:35,700
I'm Canadian, bitch.

2919
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:38,040
I'm Canadian living in America.

2920
01:53:38,820 --> 01:53:40,640
I'm playing both sides right now.

2921
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:45,300
Oh yeah, new code.

2922
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:46,420
Almost forgot to join.

2923
01:53:48,340 --> 01:53:49,260
They posted already?

2924
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:50,620
Yeah, they posted a new code.

2925
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:51,580
It's in how to join.

2926
01:53:54,380 --> 01:53:56,360
It's old school Apex now.

2927
01:53:56,740 --> 01:53:57,240
Yeah, they did.

2928
01:53:57,460 --> 01:53:59,840
Oh, and we do like...

2929
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:01,380
Watson...

2930
01:54:01,380 --> 01:54:05,320
They have specific characters we have to play.

2931
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,240
Gibraltar, Pathfinder, Wraith, Watson, Gibraltar.

2932
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:09,620
There's two Gibraltars.

2933
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:10,200
Pathfinder.

2934
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:17,180
Alright, we will be playing the Watson version.

2935
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:18,940
We're playing Watson?

2936
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:20,840
Yeah, we're gonna do the Watson.

2937
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:23,000
I call Watson.

2938
01:54:23,580 --> 01:54:24,160
I like Watson.

2939
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:27,240
Wait, does that mean I have to play Gibby?

2940
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:27,780
Yeah.

2941
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:30,120
Oh, unfortunately.

2942
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:33,420
Why can't I play Wraith and Ashe?

2943
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:37,590
Watson time.

2944
01:54:38,770 --> 01:54:40,970
Wraith is pretty bad right now.

2945
01:54:41,530 --> 01:54:42,290
Yeah, but it's old school.

2946
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:44,330
So it's old Wraith.

2947
01:54:46,150 --> 01:54:47,050
If it's old Wraith...

2948
01:54:47,530 --> 01:54:49,110
Wait, even the old school option...

2949
01:54:49,570 --> 01:54:50,590
They don't...

2950
01:54:50,590 --> 01:54:51,970
Revert it to old Wraith?

2951
01:54:55,190 --> 01:54:55,570
Is it?

2952
01:54:55,790 --> 01:54:56,990
Are they doing that in game mode?

2953
01:54:57,250 --> 01:54:57,690
Oh, they are.

2954
01:54:57,930 --> 01:54:58,870
That's what I'm saying.

2955
01:54:59,890 --> 01:55:01,590
Is it actually gonna give us the old characters?

2956
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:04,430
It says old school Apex.

2957
01:55:05,550 --> 01:55:07,190
Yeah, but it might just be like...

2958
01:55:07,190 --> 01:55:09,190
Oh, it might just be making you play...

2959
01:55:09,190 --> 01:55:10,230
The specific...

2960
01:55:10,230 --> 01:55:11,970
That's why I did my last custom.

2961
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:14,590
We actually had it on the...

2962
01:55:14,590 --> 01:55:16,210
Old school characters.

2963
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:18,750
It's a...

2964
01:55:18,750 --> 01:55:19,410
You can select it.

2965
01:55:19,470 --> 01:55:20,690
Yeah, GameCube is getting classic.

2966
01:55:21,450 --> 01:55:22,070
Yeah, it is.

2967
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:23,030
I think it is the classic.

2968
01:55:23,390 --> 01:55:25,310
Who the fuck is with us?

2969
01:55:25,330 --> 01:55:27,090
I don't even know what PUI we go to.

2970
01:55:27,890 --> 01:55:29,890
Wait, Horizon Classic is Giga.

2971
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:33,650
Why do we have Reksu in our chat?

2972
01:55:34,530 --> 01:55:35,210
Hey guys.

2973
01:55:35,770 --> 01:55:37,570
So, really sorry about earlier.

2974
01:55:37,810 --> 01:55:39,150
We weren't able to restart.

2975
01:55:39,630 --> 01:55:40,810
Due to time constraints.

2976
01:55:40,810 --> 01:55:42,710
But we are now using new code.

2977
01:55:42,870 --> 01:55:43,910
It's on switching servers.

2978
01:55:44,830 --> 01:55:46,630
We're trying to stay on top of it.

2979
01:55:46,830 --> 01:55:49,250
If you guys need anything, just let me know.

2980
01:55:49,430 --> 01:55:49,510
Alright?

2981
01:55:51,170 --> 01:55:52,050
Thank you.

2982
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:54,290
We're really, really sorry.

2983
01:55:54,730 --> 01:55:55,910
We wish we could have restarted.

2984
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:57,870
It's alright.

2985
01:55:58,330 --> 01:55:59,390
It's Doki's fault.

2986
01:55:59,610 --> 01:56:00,550
Wait, how is it my fault?

2987
01:56:00,610 --> 01:56:02,050
Other people also crashed.

2988
01:56:02,870 --> 01:56:04,470
We got third anyway, so it's fine.

2989
01:56:05,390 --> 01:56:07,430
If you guys need anything, just ping me.

2990
01:56:09,070 --> 01:56:10,530
Alright, who won the last?

2991
01:56:10,690 --> 01:56:14,630
Who were the top three teams on the last two games?

2992
01:56:21,170 --> 01:56:21,870
Oh yeah, cool.

2993
01:56:21,990 --> 01:56:24,270
Because they don't post the results and stuff.

2994
01:56:24,790 --> 01:56:27,170
I'm curious who got...

2995
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:32,110
Because I think we tied for third, so we're curious.

2996
01:56:32,570 --> 01:56:34,910
We were tied on third for the second game.

2997
01:56:37,430 --> 01:56:38,830
We're doing ALGS rules.

2998
01:56:40,150 --> 01:56:43,190
ALGS rules dictate that...

2999
01:56:43,190 --> 01:56:44,510
A, single match scores.

3000
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:47,490
Well, since it's one match, we're skipping that.

3001
01:56:47,810 --> 01:56:50,390
B, it's single match best placement.

3002
01:56:51,710 --> 01:56:52,270
There it is.

3003
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:55,050
Okay, so...

3004
01:56:57,290 --> 01:57:00,070
Oh yeah, Verhulst, did you claim your drop spot yet?

3005
01:57:00,790 --> 01:57:02,170
Yep, we're going to scroll down.

3006
01:57:02,710 --> 01:57:03,510
Oh shit, sweet.

3007
01:57:03,510 --> 01:57:04,170
Okay.

3008
01:57:06,110 --> 01:57:06,990
Alright, so...

3009
01:57:06,990 --> 01:57:09,670
Well, it's OG characters, so do we...

3010
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,010
I don't know which one's better.

3011
01:57:13,670 --> 01:57:14,470
I never got to play OG.

3012
01:57:14,930 --> 01:57:15,930
Wait, you never played OG?

3013
01:57:17,210 --> 01:57:19,270
I played OG, I didn't get to play competitive though.

3014
01:57:19,590 --> 01:57:20,610
I don't know who played it.

3015
01:57:20,610 --> 01:57:21,630
I never played competitive.

3016
01:57:23,010 --> 01:57:23,710
OG's fun.

3017
01:57:23,770 --> 01:57:26,710
I know Horizon OG is Giga, just sitting on my little lift.

3018
01:57:27,170 --> 01:57:27,910
100% being.

3019
01:57:30,890 --> 01:57:31,850
Let's see...

3020
01:57:33,210 --> 01:57:35,070
I mean, like, Wraith was really...

3021
01:57:35,070 --> 01:57:40,650
If I played OG mode, in my custom, and Wraith was really good, Wraith...

3022
01:57:40,650 --> 01:57:47,410
Ours had, like, not set characters, so, like, our team went Wraith, Pathfinder, Caustic.

3023
01:57:49,110 --> 01:57:53,750
I think Wattson's going to be better, just because Wattson's going to be, like, the only, like, defensive character.

3024
01:57:54,210 --> 01:57:54,990
That's true.

3025
01:57:55,110 --> 01:57:57,790
If you have Wattson, like, you're going to be completely unpushable.

3026
01:57:58,110 --> 01:57:58,430
Yeah.

3027
01:57:59,050 --> 01:58:00,810
So, Surefour, you'll just be on Gibraltar.

3028
01:58:01,090 --> 01:58:04,250
I'm pretty sure Oldschool Gibraltar's, like, pretty bad.

3029
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:05,590
I don't know why they put Gibraltar in the lineup.

3030
01:58:06,470 --> 01:58:08,130
What, you're putting me on a bad character?

3031
01:58:08,350 --> 01:58:10,050
Yeah, but you can make him good.

3032
01:58:11,050 --> 01:58:13,810
Surefour, you've been carrying so hard, I have to put you on the hard character.

3033
01:58:14,010 --> 01:58:17,570
Yeah, yeah, and I DC'd, so I get, like, and then I get a crutch.

3034
01:58:17,650 --> 01:58:21,350
Typically, the Gibraltar player has extreme high levels of mechanics.

3035
01:58:22,330 --> 01:58:22,650
Exactly.

3036
01:58:23,610 --> 01:58:24,670
You have to win every trade you take.

3037
01:58:24,670 --> 01:58:25,630
Okay, now you're just lying.

3038
01:58:25,730 --> 01:58:27,130
So he's trying to say you're a good player.

3039
01:58:27,130 --> 01:58:27,890
No, no, I'm being serious.

3040
01:58:29,450 --> 01:58:31,030
It's like Winston from Overwatch.

3041
01:58:33,030 --> 01:58:35,230
Why is it like Winston from Overwatch?

3042
01:58:35,750 --> 01:58:38,510
Because you put the bubble down, and then you bubble juggle.

3043
01:58:39,290 --> 01:58:40,330
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

3044
01:58:40,390 --> 01:58:41,550
That's all skill.

3045
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:44,630
That's so much skill.

3046
01:58:44,690 --> 01:58:46,070
It's all about having the biggest brain.

3047
01:58:46,350 --> 01:58:47,090
You're used to that, Surefour.

3048
01:58:47,350 --> 01:58:52,510
Me shotgun in your face.

3049
01:58:52,510 --> 01:58:53,730
Don't push me bubble.

3050
01:58:54,310 --> 01:58:56,090
You're only bubble for a brother.

3051
01:58:58,830 --> 01:59:01,910
You tried to fly, Surefour.

3052
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:12,380
I'm so excited.

3053
01:59:12,740 --> 01:59:13,960
Ready up, we're all here.

3054
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:16,080
We don't care about team 10.

3055
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:21,680
Somebody fucking moved their team 10.

3056
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,740
You can pre-select your legend here.

3057
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:24,840
Wait, you can?

3058
01:59:25,060 --> 01:59:25,420
How?

3059
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:26,820
You have to back out.

3060
01:59:31,180 --> 01:59:34,300
I assumed that, but I thought there was some hidden tech.

3061
01:59:40,180 --> 01:59:42,380
I know exactly where they are.

3062
01:59:44,140 --> 01:59:46,220
This is the OG mode.

3063
01:59:59,370 --> 02:00:02,070
We need to find and kill Giga so I can finish her.

3064
02:00:02,610 --> 02:00:04,370
Wait, what did she do to you?

3065
02:00:06,110 --> 02:00:06,630
Exist.

3066
02:00:09,770 --> 02:00:11,750
What about her existence?

3067
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:16,950
They hang out in the Discord every now and then, you know.

3068
02:00:17,570 --> 02:00:20,490
Did she do something to you that made you...

3069
02:00:20,490 --> 02:00:23,270
No, it's just about killing people you know.

3070
02:00:23,930 --> 02:00:24,790
Oh, that's true.

3071
02:00:25,570 --> 02:00:28,090
If we see Dyrus, you gotta let me finish him too.

3072
02:00:29,190 --> 02:00:29,510
Alright.

3073
02:00:32,070 --> 02:00:33,530
We got knocked out first round last time.

3074
02:00:33,830 --> 02:00:34,730
That's true.

3075
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:37,810
It might be really tough to get to them before they die.

3076
02:00:40,350 --> 02:00:41,710
We're all here.

3077
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:44,450
Start, start, start.

3078
02:00:45,170 --> 02:00:45,750
Bunger.

3079
02:00:46,290 --> 02:00:46,890
Bunger.

3080
02:00:48,330 --> 02:00:50,030
We're so close to them.

3081
02:00:50,430 --> 02:00:51,070
Bunger.

3082
02:00:51,390 --> 02:00:52,370
Where are we dropping?

3083
02:00:53,870 --> 02:00:55,650
We're so close to them.

3084
02:00:57,860 --> 02:00:59,430
We're like next door neighbors.

3085
02:00:59,430 --> 02:01:00,970
Are you wanting to go say hello?

3086
02:01:01,810 --> 02:01:01,910
Yeah.

3087
02:01:03,310 --> 02:01:04,350
Yo, yo, yo.

3088
02:01:05,570 --> 02:01:05,970
Yeah.

3089
02:01:07,170 --> 02:01:10,010
Yeah, DC last game and we still got third.

3090
02:01:11,030 --> 02:01:11,430
Exactly.

3091
02:01:11,730 --> 02:01:12,330
Free money, dude.

3092
02:01:12,870 --> 02:01:13,730
That's what I'm saying.

3093
02:01:14,890 --> 02:01:16,190
Wait, did we actually get third?

3094
02:01:16,350 --> 02:01:16,970
I don't even know.

3095
02:01:17,550 --> 02:01:18,390
Oh wait, we did?

3096
02:01:18,630 --> 02:01:19,470
That's fucking good.

3097
02:01:20,050 --> 02:01:20,990
I'll take it, I'll take it.

3098
02:01:20,990 --> 02:01:22,350
I was web fishing.

3099
02:01:26,050 --> 02:01:28,650
I'm sorry, my mic is fucking... I don't want my mic and shit, dude.

3100
02:01:29,070 --> 02:01:31,410
Yeah, you were muted for like 10 minutes that one time.

3101
02:01:31,770 --> 02:01:31,930
Yeah.

3102
02:01:31,930 --> 02:01:33,710
And now it sounds like S2 or what?

3103
02:01:34,230 --> 02:01:36,110
Well, it sounds like you're in an empty room.

3104
02:01:37,850 --> 02:01:38,850
Hello, hello, hello?

3105
02:01:39,690 --> 02:01:40,170
No, I'm not.

3106
02:01:40,830 --> 02:01:42,390
It's not that empty, so...

3107
02:01:42,390 --> 02:01:43,470
It's not that empty.

3108
02:01:43,890 --> 02:01:46,690
Yeah, but it does sound like you are in an empty room.

3109
02:01:47,910 --> 02:01:48,690
Well, we have to pop off.

3110
02:01:49,230 --> 02:01:49,670
Thank you.

3111
02:01:49,770 --> 02:01:50,730
Alright, thanks, man.

3112
02:01:51,210 --> 02:01:52,070
Can you tell us where endzone is?

3113
02:01:52,110 --> 02:01:52,490
Oh, okay.

3114
02:02:01,170 --> 02:02:02,170
Guys, we didn't win.

3115
02:02:02,350 --> 02:02:04,330
We didn't get third on the second game, guys.

3116
02:02:05,410 --> 02:02:07,370
But we got third in.

3117
02:02:07,810 --> 02:02:08,950
These guys have pride badges!

3118
02:02:11,310 --> 02:02:11,810
It's illegal!

3119
02:02:13,730 --> 02:02:14,710
Oh, we got a hot tub!

3120
02:02:14,770 --> 02:02:15,630
Oh shit, let's go!

3121
02:02:16,170 --> 02:02:16,570
Yippee!

3122
02:02:17,350 --> 02:02:18,710
No one contesting us, right?

3123
02:02:19,110 --> 02:02:19,610
I don't know.

3124
02:02:19,650 --> 02:02:21,030
If we are contested, land for the rooftop here.

3125
02:02:21,450 --> 02:02:23,130
If we're not, everyone can just go to a different side.

3126
02:02:24,390 --> 02:02:24,890
I think we're good.

3127
02:02:25,470 --> 02:02:25,710
Wait.

3128
02:02:27,230 --> 02:02:28,030
Are we?

3129
02:02:29,610 --> 02:02:31,050
There's a team behind us.

3130
02:02:31,330 --> 02:02:32,770
We're good, we're good.

3131
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:33,770
I'm gonna go to the left side.

3132
02:02:34,190 --> 02:02:35,010
I'm going right side.

3133
02:02:35,130 --> 02:02:36,190
Alright, I'll go forward.

3134
02:02:36,770 --> 02:02:38,050
And get shot at, I guess.

3135
02:02:39,090 --> 02:02:39,710
Oh shit!

3136
02:02:40,390 --> 02:02:41,070
Are you kidding me?

3137
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:43,310
Dude, we had hot spot!

3138
02:02:43,870 --> 02:02:45,430
Oh my god.

3139
02:02:45,570 --> 02:02:50,910
We should get some monetary compensation for this.

3140
02:02:50,930 --> 02:02:52,370
This is our time!

3141
02:02:52,450 --> 02:02:53,850
Our time is valuable!

3142
02:02:54,630 --> 02:02:56,690
I was gonna get a gold gun!

3143
02:02:56,690 --> 02:02:59,610
Wait, does that mean it's OG wingman and shit?

3144
02:02:59,810 --> 02:03:00,050
Yeah.

3145
02:03:02,890 --> 02:03:04,290
I'm getting the R9.

3146
02:03:05,710 --> 02:03:06,710
R9 Peacekeeper.

3147
02:03:09,490 --> 02:03:10,670
Every gun is busted in this.

3148
02:03:15,170 --> 02:03:17,830
Who the fuck didn't select it?

3149
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:25,620
We got two mint.

3150
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:27,740
This is why you shouldn't have... Okay, too fair.

3151
02:03:27,780 --> 02:03:29,380
My custom had so many fucking rules.

3152
02:03:29,380 --> 02:03:31,480
There's a bloodhound on...

3153
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:33,020
Who do you pick bloodhound?

3154
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:34,160
Team emotional damage.

3155
02:03:34,280 --> 02:03:34,760
Who the fuck?

3156
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:36,360
Somebody pick bloodhound?

3157
02:03:36,700 --> 02:03:38,800
Isn't bloodhound an OG hero?

3158
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:40,920
No, but we have set characters.

3159
02:03:41,260 --> 02:03:42,300
It's just one guy.

3160
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:45,000
We should just let this person like jump off the cliff.

3161
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:46,480
And then they couldn't play.

3162
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:47,240
That's their punishment.

3163
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:51,380
We restarted a game for one team?!

3164
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:58,240
...

3165
02:03:58,240 --> 02:03:59,560
You can't pick any character.

3166
02:03:59,780 --> 02:04:00,640
You have to be...

3167
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:03,400
There's only two set team comps allowing us to play.

3168
02:04:04,700 --> 02:04:06,180
They don't want scans, huh?

3169
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:12,620
They're only allowing either Pathfinder, Gibraltar, Wraith or Pathfinder, Gibraltar, or Watson.

3170
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:13,620
That's the only two comps they're allowing.

3171
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:14,380
Yeah.

3172
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:17,020
We could just let them play.

3173
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:17,780
Just let them play.

3174
02:04:17,860 --> 02:04:18,280
Who cares?

3175
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:19,540
It's literally one team.

3176
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:22,100
If they get first place, we fucking kick...

3177
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:24,180
We like revoke their prizes.

3178
02:04:25,940 --> 02:04:26,260
Sheeper.

3179
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:30,220
Throwing cover for a Brudda.

3180
02:04:33,320 --> 02:04:34,320
Oh, the prize pool for this one?

3181
02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:35,060
I think it's just placement.

3182
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:36,180
There's no kills, I don't think.

3183
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:36,820
Yeah, it's just placement.

3184
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:37,240
Oh, shit.

3185
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:38,020
It was Zac.

3186
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:40,320
Zac fucking... We're gonna be going early.

3187
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:42,880
Zac was the one that picked Bloodhound.

3188
02:04:44,380 --> 02:04:45,160
Oh, my God.

3189
02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:45,740
It was a pro.

3190
02:04:46,160 --> 02:04:46,760
It was a pro.

3191
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:47,820
It wasn't even a VTuber.

3192
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:49,740
We got fucking scapegoated.

3193
02:04:49,900 --> 02:04:51,980
You know, I actually did that twice in one tournament before.

3194
02:04:53,740 --> 02:04:55,860
I also did it in a tournament.

3195
02:04:58,300 --> 02:05:02,340
Oh, so kills don't count, right?

3196
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:03,260
No.

3197
02:05:03,820 --> 02:05:10,860
Well, the main problem is the lobbies take five years to start, and then you're not ready, and then it randomly starts, and then you panic.

3198
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:14,900
Yeah, you have to be locked in and stare at your main menu for ten minutes.

3199
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:16,260
I'm running here.

3200
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:18,500
Okay, so you're just gonna take my spot.

3201
02:05:18,740 --> 02:05:18,940
Yes.

3202
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:20,860
Are we running outwards?

3203
02:05:21,740 --> 02:05:22,620
If we're running outwards...

3204
02:05:22,620 --> 02:05:23,200
We'll be going that way, yeah.

3205
02:05:23,380 --> 02:05:25,620
Alright, we'll land there and push out.

3206
02:05:27,380 --> 02:05:28,900
I took your spot because I was there first.

3207
02:05:35,190 --> 02:05:36,530
I forgot there's no shields on this.

3208
02:05:36,610 --> 02:05:37,310
You have to find shields.

3209
02:05:37,570 --> 02:05:38,310
Oh, my God.

3210
02:05:38,350 --> 02:05:40,530
I actually ran past the shields because I was like, I don't need it.

3211
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:42,990
I forgot about that.

3212
02:05:45,850 --> 02:05:48,770
Oh, yeah, and it's just like OG Apex where there's zero fucking loot.

3213
02:05:48,990 --> 02:05:50,150
Yeah, exactly.

3214
02:05:50,850 --> 02:05:52,210
Oh, I got Skullpiercer.

3215
02:05:52,810 --> 02:05:53,330
It's over.

3216
02:05:54,270 --> 02:05:55,370
I got my Peacekeeper.

3217
02:05:55,570 --> 02:05:55,930
It's over.

3218
02:05:58,690 --> 02:06:00,810
Is the flatline any good in this?

3219
02:06:01,070 --> 02:06:01,390
No.

3220
02:06:02,610 --> 02:06:05,450
I don't think it was, honestly.

3221
02:06:06,650 --> 02:06:08,010
Oh, there's a wingman for you.

3222
02:06:08,330 --> 02:06:08,390
Here.

3223
02:06:09,230 --> 02:06:10,090
Nice, I'll take that.

3224
02:06:11,870 --> 02:06:12,590
I mean, if I had an R9.

3225
02:06:13,650 --> 02:06:15,210
There's another wingman here.

3226
02:06:16,430 --> 02:06:17,470
I have a wingman.

3227
02:06:17,590 --> 02:06:18,430
I'm inging it up.

3228
02:06:20,350 --> 02:06:25,790
I need to grab the... oh, find me an Ult Accel because I can get insta ult.

3229
02:06:26,050 --> 02:06:28,210
I'm picking up this extended mag for someone later.

3230
02:06:28,390 --> 02:06:28,870
Ult Accel on me.

3231
02:06:29,070 --> 02:06:29,890
I'm holding two as well.

3232
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:35,460
Oh, there's a heavy mag here.

3233
02:06:37,240 --> 02:06:39,240
I got a purple on me if someone needs it.

3234
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:41,940
Anyone find an R9, let me know.

3235
02:06:46,450 --> 02:06:49,250
You can't hear me.

3236
02:06:49,250 --> 02:06:49,930
I got PK ready.

3237
02:06:50,250 --> 02:06:53,750
I'm grabbing this one first.

3238
02:06:54,130 --> 02:06:55,010
I have two already.

3239
02:06:55,150 --> 02:06:55,670
Should I get three?

3240
02:06:57,230 --> 02:06:58,150
Can you stack them?

3241
02:06:58,530 --> 02:07:00,450
No, you can't stack Ult Accel.

3242
02:07:01,430 --> 02:07:04,650
And like, I have very limited inventory space.

3243
02:07:05,570 --> 02:07:06,270
There's another one there.

3244
02:07:06,350 --> 02:07:07,150
I wouldn't worry about holding three.

3245
02:07:07,930 --> 02:07:09,830
Alright, who wants this purple heavy mag?

3246
02:07:11,230 --> 02:07:12,130
I have a blue one.

3247
02:07:12,870 --> 02:07:13,930
I'm dropping it right here.

3248
02:07:13,930 --> 02:07:14,710
Gonna be for my wingman.

3249
02:07:15,870 --> 02:07:19,210
Alright, let me know when you find a R9.

3250
02:07:21,450 --> 02:07:22,550
I'm gonna hit this beacon up here.

3251
02:07:23,850 --> 02:07:24,230
Okay.

3252
02:07:28,030 --> 02:07:29,010
God, this is ancient.

3253
02:07:29,790 --> 02:07:30,550
Oh yeah, it is.

3254
02:07:33,590 --> 02:07:34,630
Kills don't count, right?

3255
02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:35,410
It's all about placement.

3256
02:07:36,030 --> 02:07:36,510
Health placement.

3257
02:07:38,610 --> 02:07:40,250
Did they say it was about placement?

3258
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:45,030
Because they changed the fucking rules on us.

3259
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:48,710
It just says prize pool.

3260
02:07:48,850 --> 02:07:50,430
The top three teams will share a total of 2,500.

3261
02:07:50,850 --> 02:07:51,790
Oh, so it's just placement.

3262
02:07:51,990 --> 02:07:52,210
Okay.

3263
02:07:55,010 --> 02:07:56,570
Dude, they can hold so much ammo.

3264
02:07:56,710 --> 02:07:57,650
What the fuck?

3265
02:07:58,050 --> 02:07:59,810
We're gonna try and get straight in the middle of the zone.

3266
02:08:01,070 --> 02:08:01,990
That is the plan.

3267
02:08:04,010 --> 02:08:05,350
I just need...

3268
02:08:06,330 --> 02:08:07,550
I need R9.

3269
02:08:07,830 --> 02:08:08,850
Pick me R9.

3270
02:08:09,250 --> 02:08:10,770
Let's see if there's an R9 in here.

3271
02:08:11,450 --> 02:08:12,250
No R9.

3272
02:08:12,890 --> 02:08:14,490
I'm a little late in the open.

3273
02:08:14,690 --> 02:08:17,470
I'm very vulnerable out here in the open.

3274
02:08:18,410 --> 02:08:19,370
My white armor.

3275
02:08:22,610 --> 02:08:23,410
Can you take the balloon?

3276
02:08:23,530 --> 02:08:24,250
Shoot the last guy?

3277
02:08:25,850 --> 02:08:26,610
I think that was the last guy.

3278
02:08:26,610 --> 02:08:27,210
I'm gonna take it.

3279
02:08:27,290 --> 02:08:27,490
Oh.

3280
02:08:28,050 --> 02:08:28,690
I think there's one more.

3281
02:08:29,890 --> 02:08:32,170
I think that was the last guy.

3282
02:08:32,850 --> 02:08:33,910
I swear to God, it's the other one.

3283
02:08:37,370 --> 02:08:38,490
Anyways, we should take this.

3284
02:08:39,450 --> 02:08:39,850
I bet.

3285
02:08:40,510 --> 02:08:40,870
Alright.

3286
02:08:42,710 --> 02:08:43,990
We're gonna go into air base here.

3287
02:08:46,570 --> 02:08:49,610
I'm gonna bubble insta if we get shot at.

3288
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:51,270
Fly to the left here.

3289
02:08:52,790 --> 02:08:54,030
Someone's landing bottom left.

3290
02:08:54,690 --> 02:08:56,470
They're also... Can we land here and cut these guys off?

3291
02:08:59,070 --> 02:08:59,730
I'll try.

3292
02:09:00,210 --> 02:09:00,510
Oh!

3293
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:04,840
Nah, we can't really.

3294
02:09:04,860 --> 02:09:05,280
There's people here.

3295
02:09:06,140 --> 02:09:06,680
Can you run over here?

3296
02:09:06,820 --> 02:09:07,140
Fall, come to me.

3297
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:08,960
Yep, I can try.

3298
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:09,380
I don't want you guys.

3299
02:09:09,380 --> 02:09:11,340
I bubbled just in case.

3300
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:12,840
Yep, that's a really good bubble.

3301
02:09:14,100 --> 02:09:14,540
Oop!

3302
02:09:16,900 --> 02:09:17,800
I'm gonna chill here for a second.

3303
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:20,020
I'm okay.

3304
02:09:21,940 --> 02:09:22,740
Where do we go?

3305
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:24,500
You guys just chill there for a second.

3306
02:09:24,660 --> 02:09:25,340
I'm gonna scout forward.

3307
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:27,180
See if anything's free.

3308
02:09:30,790 --> 02:09:31,850
I'll stay here.

3309
02:09:32,110 --> 02:09:33,270
My little cuppy hole.

3310
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:38,620
I feel so safe.

3311
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:39,000
Come to me.

3312
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:39,960
Coming.

3313
02:09:40,380 --> 02:09:40,840
Just run it.

3314
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:41,920
We're running.

3315
02:09:42,420 --> 02:09:43,020
We're running.

3316
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:44,800
I have bubble if we get shot at.

3317
02:09:47,640 --> 02:09:49,620
I was greedy and looked at loot.

3318
02:09:51,980 --> 02:09:53,060
Oh my god!

3319
02:09:53,260 --> 02:09:53,720
Okay, I'm fine.

3320
02:09:53,740 --> 02:09:54,180
Armour swap?

3321
02:09:56,340 --> 02:09:57,140
I'll get the armour swap.

3322
02:09:58,400 --> 02:09:59,520
I'm grabbing it now.

3323
02:10:00,640 --> 02:10:01,740
I don't want to waste my shields.

3324
02:10:03,420 --> 02:10:05,420
I think we can just put a generator in here.

3325
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:06,860
Yeah, we could.

3326
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:07,500
You want to?

3327
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:08,580
Start fencing all the doors, yeah.

3328
02:10:08,580 --> 02:10:10,440
Just put it wherever you think is safe.

3329
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:12,580
Maybe like a...

3330
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:14,240
Where do you want to put it?

3331
02:10:14,380 --> 02:10:15,220
Let me know where to put it.

3332
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:17,260
This corner right here.

3333
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:21,600
I'll throw this one.

3334
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:26,200
I don't have fences yet, so I need to wait for cooldown.

3335
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:32,940
I don't really know where the zone ends, but this is kind of the strategy.

3336
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:34,800
We just sit and hope it ends on us.

3337
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:42,000
Okay, I'm charging my thing.

3338
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:45,080
Oh, there's no R9!

3339
02:10:46,840 --> 02:10:47,840
They're going southwest.

3340
02:10:49,180 --> 02:10:50,540
There's no R9!

3341
02:10:51,620 --> 02:10:52,900
If I run away from you guys, don't follow me.

3342
02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:54,480
I'm just doing this because I'm on Pathfinder.

3343
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:55,360
Okay.

3344
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:57,220
I'm not following you.

3345
02:10:57,840 --> 02:10:58,300
Me too.

3346
02:11:05,250 --> 02:11:06,930
How many fences can I put again?

3347
02:11:07,870 --> 02:11:09,070
Oh, okay, three more.

3348
02:11:09,490 --> 02:11:09,890
I'm going to put three more.

3349
02:11:09,890 --> 02:11:10,250
Three more.

3350
02:11:15,890 --> 02:11:16,590
I'm good.

3351
02:11:20,550 --> 02:11:21,870
I'm going to shot at it two times.

3352
02:11:22,350 --> 02:11:22,810
Two times?

3353
02:11:22,830 --> 02:11:23,230
I want it.

3354
02:11:24,870 --> 02:11:27,410
Wait, that guy has white armor.

3355
02:11:28,350 --> 02:11:30,170
Wait, the generator has infinite heals in this.

3356
02:11:30,550 --> 02:11:30,790
Yeah.

3357
02:11:31,910 --> 02:11:32,630
It's OG.

3358
02:11:32,930 --> 02:11:33,410
It's OG.

3359
02:11:35,570 --> 02:11:36,450
I'm mind blown.

3360
02:11:39,270 --> 02:11:40,670
I only have one fence left.

3361
02:11:41,650 --> 02:11:42,070
Charge.

3362
02:11:44,640 --> 02:11:46,800
There's like two or three squads in there.

3363
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:51,280
I can only put very limited fences, so...

3364
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:52,420
That's life, isn't it?

3365
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:54,140
I could get rid of...

3366
02:11:56,560 --> 02:11:57,980
I have two ult accels on me.

3367
02:11:58,700 --> 02:12:00,180
I have two on me as well.

3368
02:12:00,500 --> 02:12:01,720
So I can put...

3369
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:03,860
Alright, girls, you want me to fence here?

3370
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:05,300
Hey, there's an R99 right here.

3371
02:12:05,380 --> 02:12:05,940
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

3372
02:12:06,460 --> 02:12:07,260
I pinged it.

3373
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:08,280
Oh my god!

3374
02:12:09,140 --> 02:12:10,420
You ran past it like three times.

3375
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:11,740
I ran past it like three times!

3376
02:12:18,250 --> 02:12:19,730
Where are they throwing grenades at?

3377
02:12:20,710 --> 02:12:21,370
I don't know.

3378
02:12:22,030 --> 02:12:22,730
Here it is.

3379
02:12:25,110 --> 02:12:26,910
You don't have to take it.

3380
02:12:27,670 --> 02:12:29,510
There's a team over there.

3381
02:12:31,570 --> 02:12:33,050
They're fighting in there.

3382
02:12:37,470 --> 02:12:39,110
Want me to come over?

3383
02:12:39,110 --> 02:12:40,430
Nope, nope, I'm good.

3384
02:12:40,690 --> 02:12:42,310
Nah, he hasn't told us to move yet.

3385
02:12:42,650 --> 02:12:43,270
You're right.

3386
02:12:43,350 --> 02:12:45,310
The IGL said nothing, so we do nothing.

3387
02:12:45,950 --> 02:12:46,210
Nope.

3388
02:12:47,170 --> 02:12:48,750
Bridge soldiers follow orders.

3389
02:12:50,530 --> 02:12:51,310
Why don't you have a syringe?

3390
02:12:52,450 --> 02:12:53,650
Yeah, you need it?

3391
02:12:53,650 --> 02:12:54,330
Wrong button.

3392
02:12:54,490 --> 02:12:55,030
Yeah, can I have it?

3393
02:12:56,710 --> 02:12:56,970
Alright.

3394
02:13:05,710 --> 02:13:07,250
Someone has the Kraber.

3395
02:13:08,130 --> 02:13:08,890
A Kraber?

3396
02:13:08,990 --> 02:13:10,070
I'm fucking dead.

3397
02:13:10,810 --> 02:13:11,610
They have a Kraber.

3398
02:13:13,190 --> 02:13:13,910
Why are you dead?

3399
02:13:13,910 --> 02:13:15,170
Because I have white armor.

3400
02:13:16,530 --> 02:13:17,770
Just... get blue.

3401
02:13:18,450 --> 02:13:18,910
Oh yeah?

3402
02:13:19,170 --> 02:13:20,210
Fucking whose body?

3403
02:13:20,450 --> 02:13:21,550
I hear someone taking a zip.

3404
02:13:21,930 --> 02:13:23,130
Doesn't the Kraber do more damage than this?

3405
02:13:23,230 --> 02:13:23,710
Yeah.

3406
02:13:26,130 --> 02:13:28,350
So I'm like, what the fuck do I do?

3407
02:13:28,370 --> 02:13:28,610
They're up there.

3408
02:13:29,430 --> 02:13:30,370
No they're not.

3409
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:32,890
No, they are up there.

3410
02:13:33,890 --> 02:13:34,430
Oh yeah, they are.

3411
02:13:35,470 --> 02:13:36,430
Blue armor?

3412
02:13:37,830 --> 02:13:39,450
It's not fair, they have blue armor.

3413
02:13:39,450 --> 02:13:41,270
I have to beat the bitch, boy.

3414
02:13:45,320 --> 02:13:46,800
What do I...

3415
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:48,200
Oh, I can put 3x on this.

3416
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:54,820
Why can't I...

3417
02:13:54,820 --> 02:13:57,540
Why can't somebody with blue armor die next to us?

3418
02:13:57,600 --> 02:13:58,600
We really can't do anything now.

3419
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:00,940
Because of this whole Kraber team.

3420
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:02,340
Are they on the roof with Kraber?

3421
02:14:02,860 --> 02:14:05,280
Oh, LaunchKraber only did 125?

3422
02:14:06,460 --> 02:14:07,160
Is that true?

3423
02:14:07,860 --> 02:14:09,460
I thought LaunchKraber was strong.

3424
02:14:10,980 --> 02:14:12,480
They buffed the Kraber?

3425
02:14:13,980 --> 02:14:21,600
GawkGFart9k Oh, that's the gamer subs flavor that you can buy with my code DokiBird for 10% off.

3426
02:14:29,430 --> 02:14:31,450
LaunchKraber hit 210 for headshot.

3427
02:14:32,510 --> 02:14:34,050
125 the body.

3428
02:14:34,510 --> 02:14:35,930
Wait, they shot my thing.

3429
02:14:37,290 --> 02:14:38,310
Why'd you let them do that?

3430
02:14:38,730 --> 02:14:40,090
Oh, they're in, they're in.

3431
02:14:40,090 --> 02:14:40,970
Oh.

3432
02:14:41,370 --> 02:14:44,310
They have gold armor.

3433
02:14:44,910 --> 02:14:46,550
I don't know.

3434
02:14:47,770 --> 02:14:48,450
That is not good.

3435
02:14:48,930 --> 02:14:49,790
They're rushing.

3436
02:14:53,530 --> 02:14:55,150
They just walked right in.

3437
02:14:56,090 --> 02:14:59,550
My fences were broken and I was like, what?

3438
02:14:59,710 --> 02:15:01,170
And then they literally just shot me.

3439
02:15:01,170 --> 02:15:02,610
I was on the opposite side.

3440
02:15:02,970 --> 02:15:05,290
I literally heard my fence break.

3441
02:15:05,350 --> 02:15:06,990
Hey, it's Apex Classic.

3442
02:15:06,990 --> 02:15:07,790
No sound bro.

3443
02:15:08,110 --> 02:15:12,510
I heard my fence break and then I turned around and they were dead.

3444
02:15:14,990 --> 02:15:16,190
Oh, I guess we wait.

3445
02:15:16,870 --> 02:15:18,790
We all wait then.

3446
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:24,380
It did not help.

3447
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:27,260
That there was no sound.

3448
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:28,900
Audio cue for either of us.

3449
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:30,880
OG Apex.

3450
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:32,740
I love OG Apex.

3451
02:15:39,800 --> 02:15:40,740
Oh my god.

3452
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:41,960
They just got one shot.

3453
02:15:41,960 --> 02:15:44,980
I had white armor.

3454
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:46,480
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

3455
02:15:47,580 --> 02:15:48,840
He had gold armor.

3456
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:51,240
No, I just got L-starred.

3457
02:15:51,680 --> 02:15:53,180
L-starred 168.

3458
02:15:54,340 --> 02:15:55,800
Almost everyone I've shot has purple armor.

3459
02:15:55,900 --> 02:15:56,400
It's pretty insane.

3460
02:15:57,640 --> 02:15:58,700
I'm lucky or what?

3461
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:04,200
I was so confused because I was like, what?

3462
02:16:04,280 --> 02:16:05,220
My fence broke.

3463
02:16:05,380 --> 02:16:08,100
And then it was like a distraction.

3464
02:16:10,740 --> 02:16:11,180
Skulltown.

3465
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:13,080
Was Skulltown loot not good in OG Apex?

3466
02:16:14,120 --> 02:16:14,480
No.

3467
02:16:14,700 --> 02:16:15,720
It was terrible.

3468
02:16:16,540 --> 02:16:18,100
People just landed there because it was fun.

3469
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:20,520
Shoot.

3470
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:22,240
People landed there because it was good.

3471
02:16:23,780 --> 02:16:25,340
Skulltown loot was always bad.

3472
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:29,680
People just landed there because everybody landed there and it was just a fun brawl session.

3473
02:16:30,680 --> 02:16:34,240
People just wanted fast fights and then you leave Skulltown.

3474
02:16:34,400 --> 02:16:37,960
I got timed out again?!

3475
02:16:37,960 --> 02:16:39,060
Noob down.

3476
02:16:45,170 --> 02:16:47,490
Wait, can you outheal this down in OG Apex?

3477
02:16:48,110 --> 02:16:48,510
Yes.

3478
02:16:49,150 --> 02:16:51,670
Yeah, if you're lifeline.

3479
02:16:52,250 --> 02:16:53,510
You about to do some rat shit?

3480
02:16:56,390 --> 02:16:57,350
Am I back in?

3481
02:16:57,430 --> 02:16:58,010
I'm back in.

3482
02:16:58,090 --> 02:16:58,790
Okay, thank god.

3483
02:16:59,950 --> 02:17:01,650
Bro, these cervicals are fucking ass.

3484
02:17:06,570 --> 02:17:07,790
Oh my god.

3485
02:17:07,790 --> 02:17:07,850
Oh my god.

3486
02:17:16,310 --> 02:17:17,690
I'm gonna eat some popcorn.

3487
02:17:18,530 --> 02:17:20,030
Wait, you did 10 damage?

3488
02:17:22,130 --> 02:17:23,130
Or is that me?

3489
02:17:23,270 --> 02:17:24,430
No, there's no way that's me.

3490
02:17:24,510 --> 02:17:25,270
I did 10 damage.

3491
02:17:33,530 --> 02:17:34,730
Guys, I'm eating popcorn.

3492
02:17:34,970 --> 02:17:38,550
Chat, I need something in my life to make me happy.

3493
02:17:59,830 --> 02:18:00,850
Look at him go!

3494
02:18:03,030 --> 02:18:03,510
Okay.

3495
02:18:06,970 --> 02:18:07,450
Damn.

3496
02:18:07,450 --> 02:18:09,290
Look at him go, that's my goat.

3497
02:18:16,440 --> 02:18:17,460
Look at him go.

3498
02:18:18,620 --> 02:18:21,200
Guys, if I put my name at the bottom, it looks like I'm playing.

3499
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:38,690
That guy's pretty good.

3500
02:18:38,770 --> 02:18:39,530
Thanks, that's me.

3501
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:48,260
Surefour put up a web fishing queue.

3502
02:18:53,710 --> 02:18:54,730
Oh, Surefour is AFK.

3503
02:19:04,810 --> 02:19:06,210
Alright, I muted myself.

3504
02:19:09,490 --> 02:19:12,410
I muted myself so Verhulst could focus.

3505
02:19:13,530 --> 02:19:16,750
Bro, I'm so fucking tilted at the

3506
02:19:19,790 --> 02:19:21,070
server code shit.

3507
02:19:22,330 --> 02:19:24,850
Also, I'm sad I didn't get to shoot my gun.

3508
02:19:25,210 --> 02:19:26,110
I'm so sad.

3509
02:19:26,690 --> 02:19:27,890
I was so confused.

3510
02:19:28,030 --> 02:19:29,670
I was like, why did the fence break?

3511
02:19:30,010 --> 02:19:31,050
I thought it was a bug.

3512
02:19:36,310 --> 02:19:39,910
Oh no, but when you get to the final zone, it moves super fucking fast.

3513
02:19:42,110 --> 02:19:44,990
It's like a 3 second, it was like a 1 second move.

3514
02:19:50,210 --> 02:19:51,230
I'm just sad.

3515
02:19:51,650 --> 02:19:53,090
I couldn't even shoot my gun.

3516
02:19:54,410 --> 02:19:56,910
I didn't hear them walk up, and I was like, really?

3517
02:19:57,330 --> 02:19:59,150
Why did my fence break there?

3518
02:20:01,530 --> 02:20:05,390
They pushed me so fast I couldn't even react to it because I didn't hear the footsteps.

3519
02:20:07,010 --> 02:20:09,390
I just wanted to shoot my R9.

3520
02:20:10,550 --> 02:20:13,350
I just wanted to shoot my R9.

3521
02:20:15,490 --> 02:20:16,490
That's it.

3522
02:20:16,850 --> 02:20:18,390
I was so ready to.

3523
02:20:19,610 --> 02:20:21,390
If I was Wraith, I would have lived.

3524
02:20:22,550 --> 02:20:26,410
If I was Wraith, I could have lived.

3525
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:34,720
At least we got third in that one game.

3526
02:20:35,700 --> 02:20:37,720
We just need Verhulst to keep ratting.

3527
02:20:38,980 --> 02:20:40,040
Did I get that crate?

3528
02:20:44,020 --> 02:20:45,260
Never meant to be.

3529
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:48,920
Can't believe I couldn't get the R9.

3530
02:20:52,670 --> 02:20:53,990
I didn't even eat lunch you guys.

3531
02:20:54,350 --> 02:20:58,430
I woke up, went straight, had to do a lot of work.

3532
02:20:59,250 --> 02:21:02,170
Oh my god, I forgot to queue up.

3533
02:21:02,410 --> 02:21:03,730
Guys, the Fortnite video is done.

3534
02:21:04,410 --> 02:21:05,690
I'm supposed to upload it today.

3535
02:21:12,050 --> 02:21:13,350
Oh my god.

3536
02:21:13,770 --> 02:21:14,010
Oh my god.

3537
02:21:14,010 --> 02:21:15,110
I'm supposed to upload it today.

3538
02:21:15,390 --> 02:21:18,070
Within like... Damn, you still alive and kicking it.

3539
02:21:18,250 --> 02:21:19,010
40 minutes.

3540
02:21:19,930 --> 02:21:22,410
I can't upload it because I need to use the internet.

3541
02:21:23,690 --> 02:21:24,850
Welcome back, Surefour.

3542
02:21:25,910 --> 02:21:26,810
No problem.

3543
02:21:27,350 --> 02:21:29,730
Just live till top three so then we can get third place.

3544
02:21:29,830 --> 02:21:32,270
Surefour and I did nothing to deserve it but we still win money.

3545
02:21:32,650 --> 02:21:34,250
Bro, that's on you, motherfucker.

3546
02:21:34,310 --> 02:21:36,270
You just let those motherfuckers walk in.

3547
02:21:36,270 --> 02:21:37,290
I didn't hear anything either.

3548
02:21:37,430 --> 02:21:38,130
You didn't hear anything.

3549
02:21:38,130 --> 02:21:39,730
It wasn't on my side.

3550
02:21:40,030 --> 02:21:42,290
I was on your side when it happened.

3551
02:21:42,770 --> 02:21:42,910
Chill, chill, chill.

3552
02:21:43,230 --> 02:21:45,090
Sorry, you can focus.

3553
02:21:50,310 --> 02:21:51,410
We got one in the line here.

3554
02:21:52,030 --> 02:21:53,890
Oh yeah, the mastiff is fucking broken in this.

3555
02:21:54,830 --> 02:21:56,690
I'm just surprised you got rid of the R9.

3556
02:21:57,990 --> 02:21:58,990
I didn't have a mag for it.

3557
02:22:02,150 --> 02:22:03,790
Everybody is just wingmen.

3558
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:09,380
Is that a rat?

3559
02:22:09,480 --> 02:22:09,740
Oh no.

3560
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,040
There's a rat there.

3561
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:15,240
There might be a full team ratting in the...

3562
02:22:15,240 --> 02:22:15,900
They're fighting back there.

3563
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:16,760
I don't think I want to go this way.

3564
02:22:16,860 --> 02:22:17,600
I believe in you.

3565
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:19,360
Yeah, we both believe in you.

3566
02:22:19,380 --> 02:22:20,300
Just hide in that tube.

3567
02:22:20,420 --> 02:22:21,000
Fuck it, bro.

3568
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:24,480
What if a full team runs into that tube?

3569
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:26,560
You can hide in the trees on this.

3570
02:22:26,620 --> 02:22:27,020
It's OG.

3571
02:22:27,980 --> 02:22:29,220
Oh yeah, you can hide in the trees.

3572
02:22:29,380 --> 02:22:29,620
Yeah.

3573
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:31,780
You can literally hide in the trees.

3574
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:35,260
He doesn't give a fuck.

3575
02:22:35,260 --> 02:22:37,000
He doesn't care about the trees.

3576
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:38,760
He said, fuck the trees.

3577
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:40,140
He has his own fucking plan.

3578
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:41,680
Oh.

3579
02:22:42,220 --> 02:22:43,220
He is a pro player.

3580
02:22:43,320 --> 02:22:44,240
He knows more than us.

3581
02:22:44,600 --> 02:22:44,920
True.

3582
02:22:47,580 --> 02:22:50,800
He saw both of us die and he's just like, what the fuck are these kids doing?

3583
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:55,340
He saw both of us die and then he's just like these guys don't know what they're talking about.

3584
02:22:57,800 --> 02:22:59,200
There's a little sneak peek over here.

3585
02:22:59,560 --> 02:23:01,180
There's a tree over there.

3586
02:23:02,940 --> 02:23:04,260
There's a tree over there.

3587
02:23:06,730 --> 02:23:07,810
He doesn't give a fuck.

3588
02:23:07,890 --> 02:23:08,510
He wants kills.

3589
02:23:08,750 --> 02:23:09,350
He wants blood.

3590
02:23:09,550 --> 02:23:09,750
Uh oh.

3591
02:23:09,890 --> 02:23:10,610
Uh oh.

3592
02:23:14,230 --> 02:23:16,690
He wants kills when kills don't matter.

3593
02:23:17,850 --> 02:23:19,030
Okay, that's toxic.

3594
02:23:21,190 --> 02:23:21,670
Remember,

3595
02:23:25,910 --> 02:23:27,010
you said...

3596
02:23:27,010 --> 02:23:27,690
I'm playing for glory.

3597
02:23:28,310 --> 02:23:30,690
Yeah, Mandy peer pressured him into this.

3598
02:23:30,690 --> 02:23:31,790
He doesn't give a fuck.

3599
02:23:32,290 --> 02:23:33,430
That's true, that's true.

3600
02:23:33,730 --> 02:23:35,670
He wants to hit a fucking clip, baby.

3601
02:23:36,510 --> 02:23:38,390
What's that YouTube video right there?

3602
02:23:39,590 --> 02:23:40,630
Carries two deadweights.

3603
02:23:40,630 --> 02:23:41,450
Carries two deadweights.

3604
02:23:42,010 --> 02:23:43,990
Carries two VTubers to victory.

3605
02:23:44,090 --> 02:23:45,590
Hey, I pull my weight when you fucking DC.

3606
02:23:45,910 --> 02:23:46,630
Can one of you stream snipe for me?

3607
02:23:47,150 --> 02:23:50,850
No, that's supposed to be a Discord message here.

3608
02:23:52,390 --> 02:23:53,470
Oh, I thought you guys were muted.

3609
02:23:56,230 --> 02:23:57,490
Wait, but you're not muted.

3610
02:24:05,390 --> 02:24:06,370
Oh, he's scared.

3611
02:24:06,450 --> 02:24:07,470
He thinks you're a full team.

3612
02:24:08,230 --> 02:24:08,670
Gulp.

3613
02:24:17,050 --> 02:24:17,890
Oh, landing.

3614
02:24:18,770 --> 02:24:19,990
Nevermind, that's ambient noises.

3615
02:24:20,090 --> 02:24:20,510
What the fuck?

3616
02:24:20,570 --> 02:24:21,710
That sounded like a landing jet.

3617
02:24:26,010 --> 02:24:26,890
Double Mastiff?

3618
02:24:27,490 --> 02:24:27,710
Whoa.

3619
02:24:29,710 --> 02:24:31,090
Wowee, Kraber Mastiff?

3620
02:24:31,170 --> 02:24:31,630
Mastiff Kraber?

3621
02:24:33,050 --> 02:24:33,490
Imagine.

3622
02:24:33,910 --> 02:24:35,210
Oh, Digi threat though.

3623
02:24:35,470 --> 02:24:36,730
Is that any good, bro?

3624
02:24:36,730 --> 02:24:37,530
It's alright.

3625
02:24:37,670 --> 02:24:38,770
I mean, I died by it.

3626
02:24:38,870 --> 02:24:39,510
I don't know.

3627
02:24:39,590 --> 02:24:40,570
I don't know if that's any good.

3628
02:24:41,010 --> 02:24:42,690
It has very limited ammo.

3629
02:24:42,830 --> 02:24:44,650
It's good, but ammo is very limited.

3630
02:24:45,250 --> 02:24:45,590
Oh, yeah.

3631
02:24:45,650 --> 02:24:46,110
I'm not running it.

3632
02:24:46,150 --> 02:24:46,930
Yeah, no, don't.

3633
02:24:47,030 --> 02:24:47,550
That's what I'm saying.

3634
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:49,670
I ran that last time.

3635
02:24:50,070 --> 02:24:53,530
It was really good, but I basically couldn't fight at the end.

3636
02:24:58,870 --> 02:24:59,930
They fighting in there.

3637
02:25:01,250 --> 02:25:02,470
Seven squads left.

3638
02:25:04,010 --> 02:25:04,970
Oh, kill leader's dead.

3639
02:25:05,450 --> 02:25:06,190
I need to hold his rooftop.

3640
02:25:08,310 --> 02:25:09,630
Broken ass roof.

3641
02:25:11,850 --> 02:25:12,910
They'll think you're a full team.

3642
02:25:19,430 --> 02:25:22,270
Like, shoot with two different guns so they'll think you're two different people.

3643
02:25:23,310 --> 02:25:25,470
Yeah, shoot them with the Mastiff across the map.

3644
02:25:26,270 --> 02:25:27,210
Sounds like a good idea.

3645
02:25:27,990 --> 02:25:28,750
They'll know for sure.

3646
02:25:28,830 --> 02:25:31,090
They'll be like, oh man, the pro player wouldn't do that.

3647
02:25:44,850 --> 02:25:45,770
They're so scared.

3648
02:25:45,830 --> 02:25:47,010
They literally think you're a full team.

3649
02:25:48,110 --> 02:25:48,830
That's the plan.

3650
02:25:49,610 --> 02:25:50,670
Trying to scare them off.

3651
02:25:50,930 --> 02:25:52,230
Yeah, don't go this side.

3652
02:25:53,590 --> 02:25:55,610
This is basically a team of three for host.

3653
02:25:57,710 --> 02:25:58,850
Oh my god, yes.

3654
02:26:04,130 --> 02:26:04,570
Oh.

3655
02:26:20,270 --> 02:26:21,750
I think I scared them off.

3656
02:26:22,670 --> 02:26:23,170
Nice job.

3657
02:26:23,290 --> 02:26:24,950
I knew you could do it.

3658
02:26:27,310 --> 02:26:28,810
Like, what would you go after?

3659
02:26:30,810 --> 02:26:31,730
In a tree.

3660
02:26:37,060 --> 02:26:41,040
I mean, they're in the house because I see the gen.

3661
02:26:41,420 --> 02:26:42,560
That used to be our house.

3662
02:26:44,580 --> 02:26:45,100
Yeah.

3663
02:26:45,880 --> 02:26:49,360
Until somebody didn't hear the...

3664
02:26:49,360 --> 02:26:50,300
Won't say any names or anything.

3665
02:26:50,600 --> 02:26:53,240
Somebody didn't hear the sound of the...

3666
02:26:55,440 --> 02:26:55,740
Damn.

3667
02:26:56,920 --> 02:26:59,740
The guys on the other side don't give a fuck about you.

3668
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:02,840
They're all just teaming up on the people zipping.

3669
02:27:03,060 --> 02:27:04,640
Like, what the fuck, you've been standing up there?

3670
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:06,100
They haven't shot you once.

3671
02:27:08,180 --> 02:27:09,060
They're scared.

3672
02:27:09,180 --> 02:27:10,380
They saw his shots.

3673
02:27:12,200 --> 02:27:13,220
Oh, never mind.

3674
02:27:13,240 --> 02:27:13,680
There it is.

3675
02:27:17,190 --> 02:27:18,890
They're right below you.

3676
02:27:20,090 --> 02:27:21,070
There's one team.

3677
02:27:21,210 --> 02:27:22,090
That's just one guy.

3678
02:27:23,170 --> 02:27:24,010
Just like you.

3679
02:27:26,510 --> 02:27:26,990
Oh.

3680
02:27:27,350 --> 02:27:27,830
Oh.

3681
02:27:28,610 --> 02:27:29,850
Did they know you're...

3682
02:27:29,850 --> 02:27:30,610
I hear Lifeline.

3683
02:27:30,970 --> 02:27:31,390
Never mind.

3684
02:27:32,550 --> 02:27:34,250
Oh, this guy knows how to play the video.

3685
02:27:34,350 --> 02:27:35,750
Wait, that's the team that killed me.

3686
02:27:36,410 --> 02:27:36,910
That's them.

3687
02:27:37,570 --> 02:27:38,250
You sure?

3688
02:27:38,510 --> 02:27:40,970
That guy had gold armor.

3689
02:27:41,110 --> 02:27:41,770
That was purple.

3690
02:27:48,350 --> 02:27:49,690
What's the game plan here?

3691
02:27:50,590 --> 02:27:51,990
I think I need to go to the middle of the ditch early.

3692
02:27:53,150 --> 02:27:53,550
Oh.

3693
02:27:54,350 --> 02:27:55,430
Whoa, there's a guy...

3694
02:27:55,430 --> 02:27:56,410
That sounds scary.

3695
02:27:56,410 --> 02:27:57,070
Yeah.

3696
02:27:59,630 --> 02:28:02,050
Everyone is shooting at you now.

3697
02:28:02,710 --> 02:28:03,390
They know.

3698
02:28:03,610 --> 02:28:05,250
They know who you are.

3699
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:09,040
Oh.

3700
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:11,880
Whoa.

3701
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:17,260
There's somebody here.

3702
02:28:18,820 --> 02:28:19,580
Ah!

3703
02:28:19,880 --> 02:28:20,300
Ah!

3704
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:26,560
There's people in that area.

3705
02:28:27,940 --> 02:28:28,940
Blackpink in your area?

3706
02:28:29,020 --> 02:28:29,280
Oh, whoa!

3707
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:30,000
He's a solo!

3708
02:28:32,620 --> 02:28:33,400
Wraith and Ashe?

3709
02:28:33,700 --> 02:28:34,840
We might need a bat now.

3710
02:28:36,940 --> 02:28:37,760
Oh, there's one in there.

3711
02:28:38,860 --> 02:28:39,840
Oh, you can shoot him.

3712
02:28:40,380 --> 02:28:41,240
No, no!

3713
02:28:42,280 --> 02:28:43,480
That was risky.

3714
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:45,020
Oh!

3715
02:28:45,420 --> 02:28:45,860
No!

3716
02:28:47,820 --> 02:28:49,680
I just dodged that so bad.

3717
02:28:50,440 --> 02:28:51,800
That grapple was so bad.

3718
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:55,060
Yeah, that grapple into him was crazy.

3719
02:28:55,060 --> 02:28:56,380
Yeah, I thought you were just going to...

3720
02:28:56,380 --> 02:28:58,140
I thought you were just going to AIM man him a bit.

3721
02:28:58,240 --> 02:28:58,440
Yeah.

3722
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:02,460
I thought he was going to back up and I just keep shooting at him.

3723
02:29:02,560 --> 02:29:05,340
So I was going to try and grapple into his face and I completely botched that grapple.

3724
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:08,800
He grappled into his L-Star.

3725
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:09,600
That's crazy.

3726
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:10,640
I was like, whoa!

3727
02:29:10,980 --> 02:29:11,260
Yeah.

3728
02:29:12,360 --> 02:29:14,740
I mean, you made a top 7.

3729
02:29:15,580 --> 02:29:16,320
He had a vision.

3730
02:29:16,740 --> 02:29:17,940
He had a vision right there.

3731
02:29:18,680 --> 02:29:19,100
It was close.

3732
02:29:19,580 --> 02:29:21,340
Pathfinder's grapple mechanics are different on this.

3733
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:22,280
It is.

3734
02:29:22,320 --> 02:29:23,040
It is different.

3735
02:29:23,740 --> 02:29:24,080
In OG.

3736
02:29:32,400 --> 02:29:33,500
Oh my god.

3737
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:35,140
Oh my god, the zone moves so fast.

3738
02:29:35,180 --> 02:29:35,880
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

3739
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:37,100
The zone is like...

3740
02:29:37,100 --> 02:29:39,800
And then the end zone is like literally...

3741
02:29:41,160 --> 02:29:42,140
Oh my god.

3742
02:29:42,360 --> 02:29:43,160
That poor team.

3743
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:44,920
Uh oh.

3744
02:29:44,980 --> 02:29:45,860
Oh, he can't climb!

3745
02:29:45,940 --> 02:29:46,580
He can't climb!

3746
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:49,220
He's so dead!

3747
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:51,360
I'll pretend to be part of this team!

3748
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:52,900
Be their friend!

3749
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:53,840
Be their friend, Pathfinder!

3750
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:54,740
He got away with it.

3751
02:29:54,740 --> 02:29:56,520
Oh my god, he actually got away!

3752
02:29:56,620 --> 02:29:57,680
He might get 3rd out of this.

3753
02:29:59,000 --> 02:29:59,740
Oh, that's crazy!

3754
02:29:59,740 --> 02:30:00,840
He's getting 3rd out of that.

3755
02:30:02,120 --> 02:30:03,420
Why isn't he medding, though?

3756
02:30:03,720 --> 02:30:05,020
Because they can hear the sound.

3757
02:30:05,580 --> 02:30:06,020
They can hear it.

3758
02:30:07,880 --> 02:30:10,360
If he meds, they might be able to hear the med kit.

3759
02:30:10,620 --> 02:30:11,320
Or maybe he ran out of meds.

3760
02:30:11,340 --> 02:30:12,660
He should have done it during all the fighting.

3761
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,420
Oh my god, he's actually going to get 3rd because of it.

3762
02:30:16,540 --> 02:30:17,580
He might not have any meds.

3763
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:18,940
He's probably been sitting in his zone the entire game.

3764
02:30:20,420 --> 02:30:22,200
I mean, their Gibraltar was on white armor.

3765
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:23,460
That's true.

3766
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:25,700
I think I just armor swapped it, though.

3767
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:32,000
He's got 2.5k damage, though.

3768
02:30:32,760 --> 02:30:33,140
Yeah.

3769
02:30:34,960 --> 02:30:36,120
Oh, he's getting 3rd.

3770
02:30:36,180 --> 02:30:37,400
Or even 2nd, maybe.

3771
02:30:40,320 --> 02:30:41,380
What the fuck?

3772
02:30:41,440 --> 02:30:42,340
Where did that come from?

3773
02:30:43,620 --> 02:30:45,920
Oh my god.

3774
02:30:47,540 --> 02:30:47,640
No!

3775
02:30:50,920 --> 02:30:52,840
Oh my god!

3776
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:54,340
You're so stupid!

3777
02:30:54,500 --> 02:30:55,140
You're so stupid!

3778
02:30:55,360 --> 02:30:57,640
You just don't look down!

3779
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:02,920
Well, they think their behind is completely clear at this point.

3780
02:31:04,660 --> 02:31:06,100
That's crazy.

3781
02:31:06,480 --> 02:31:09,720
The moment he gets spotted, there's like one poke.

3782
02:31:09,720 --> 02:31:12,560
It's one body shot and he's fucking dead.

3783
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:13,760
The motherfucker doesn't even have his gun out.

3784
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:16,740
Oh, they get 3rd.

3785
02:31:16,800 --> 02:31:17,400
They get money.

3786
02:31:18,900 --> 02:31:19,460
Dead.

3787
02:31:19,740 --> 02:31:20,040
Dead.

3788
02:31:22,080 --> 02:31:23,100
Pineapple pizza.

3789
02:31:23,300 --> 02:31:24,240
Oh, it's still hard.

3790
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:27,380
Look at this guy.

3791
02:31:30,080 --> 02:31:31,760
It was just two rats!

3792
02:31:34,220 --> 02:31:35,640
Gamers never look down.

3793
02:31:35,640 --> 02:31:35,820
Oh my god.

3794
02:31:37,960 --> 02:31:39,700
Alright, last two games.

3795
02:31:42,820 --> 02:31:44,880
He told us this was going to end at 3.

3796
02:31:46,860 --> 02:31:48,780
Yeah, well, you knew what you were getting into.

3797
02:31:48,900 --> 02:31:49,280
I did.

3798
02:31:49,420 --> 02:31:49,800
I knew.

3799
02:31:49,900 --> 02:31:53,400
I was like, that's very ambitious when I saw that.

3800
02:31:53,840 --> 02:31:54,900
Someone told you it was going to end at 3?

3801
02:31:55,220 --> 02:31:59,100
Yeah, they said it was going to end at 3 and I was like, that's so ambitious.

3802
02:31:59,340 --> 02:32:01,560
I was like, there's no way it's going to end at 3.

3803
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:07,060
I knew it was not.

3804
02:32:07,180 --> 02:32:12,360
I was like, a tournament custom with 6 games is like 3-4 hours.

3805
02:32:20,830 --> 02:32:23,290
I just realized, Strike and Flame and MT, you're on a team?

3806
02:32:25,590 --> 02:32:26,630
What is that?

3807
02:32:26,630 --> 02:32:28,170
Game 5, weapon lock.

3808
02:32:28,250 --> 02:32:28,950
Weapon selection.

3809
02:32:29,130 --> 02:32:32,150
Mandi will stream live on stream to select two weapon categories.

3810
02:32:32,330 --> 02:32:35,270
Participants must use weapons from these categories for the entire game.

3811
02:32:35,730 --> 02:32:36,050
Yeah.

3812
02:32:36,050 --> 02:32:37,850
I hope it's...

3813
02:32:37,850 --> 02:32:38,730
I hope it's sniper.

3814
02:32:39,570 --> 02:32:40,290
I want a sniper.

3815
02:32:41,430 --> 02:32:42,130
Can we do...

3816
02:32:42,130 --> 02:32:47,890
Can we do hitscan charge rifle?

3817
02:32:49,890 --> 02:32:52,150
You can't revert it back.

3818
02:32:53,110 --> 02:32:53,830
You can't.

3819
02:32:53,850 --> 02:32:56,290
There's no way to revert the guns.

3820
02:32:56,830 --> 02:32:59,110
I want hitscan charge rifle now.

3821
02:33:02,070 --> 02:33:04,550
Then I'm going to rename myself to charge king.

3822
02:33:10,430 --> 02:33:11,610
I wish you can do that.

3823
02:33:11,690 --> 02:33:13,470
I wish you can bring back old guns.

3824
02:33:14,010 --> 02:33:15,110
That was so fun.

3825
02:33:15,250 --> 02:33:16,870
Just solo queueing to rank.

3826
02:33:16,930 --> 02:33:20,510
Getting to friend players and just shooting them out of the air.

3827
02:33:20,790 --> 02:33:21,510
Who was our third?

3828
02:33:21,710 --> 02:33:23,410
We did a full charge rifle.

3829
02:33:24,750 --> 02:33:26,570
I think it was Gully.

3830
02:33:26,870 --> 02:33:27,410
Was it Gully?

3831
02:33:27,650 --> 02:33:31,150
Yeah, we won all charge rifle and it actually griefed Timmy.

3832
02:33:31,250 --> 02:33:33,190
He got so mad on stream about us.

3833
02:33:33,730 --> 02:33:35,290
I remember that shit.

3834
02:33:36,150 --> 02:33:37,670
I was on top of the windmill.

3835
02:33:38,370 --> 02:33:39,290
No, the uh...

3836
02:33:40,690 --> 02:33:41,430
The watermill?

3837
02:33:41,790 --> 02:33:42,650
Yeah, it was the watermill.

3838
02:33:42,730 --> 02:33:44,730
You kept fucking griefing Timmy and his game.

3839
02:33:44,790 --> 02:33:45,790
Yeah, Timmy and Asu.

3840
02:33:46,110 --> 02:33:48,330
Oh yeah, it was Timmy and Asu!

3841
02:33:53,070 --> 02:33:54,070
Wait, what was it?

3842
02:33:54,110 --> 02:33:54,710
They re-rolled?

3843
02:33:55,390 --> 02:33:56,850
LMGs and shotguns.

3844
02:33:57,430 --> 02:33:58,550
What's an LMG?

3845
02:33:58,730 --> 02:34:00,950
Newcastle, Lifeline, and Gibby are banned.

3846
02:34:01,770 --> 02:34:02,730
LMG guns.

3847
02:34:03,570 --> 02:34:04,770
LMGs and shotguns?

3848
02:34:04,770 --> 02:34:05,430
You gotta be kidding me.

3849
02:34:05,430 --> 02:34:07,530
Wait, what guns are those?

3850
02:34:08,910 --> 02:34:10,390
What's in the LMG category?

3851
02:34:12,490 --> 02:34:16,130
Spitfire, Rampage, Devotion, L-Star.

3852
02:34:17,210 --> 02:34:18,510
I'll run the Spitfire.

3853
02:34:19,250 --> 02:34:20,970
Spitfire is probably the best option.

3854
02:34:21,190 --> 02:34:23,170
Yeah, and then...

3855
02:34:23,170 --> 02:34:24,550
Spitfire and...

3856
02:34:24,550 --> 02:34:26,250
Is L-Star an LMG?

3857
02:34:28,630 --> 02:34:30,210
Wait, you can use Rampart?

3858
02:34:30,290 --> 02:34:31,470
They're allowing Rampart, Sheila.

3859
02:34:32,550 --> 02:34:32,910
Oh!

3860
02:34:32,910 --> 02:34:35,750
Wait, I can do Vantage, and I can just snipe people.

3861
02:34:41,770 --> 02:34:42,910
Wait, what do we play?

3862
02:34:43,550 --> 02:34:44,030
For host?

3863
02:34:52,950 --> 02:34:54,330
Give us your wisdom.

3864
02:34:55,590 --> 02:34:57,430
The same comp...

3865
02:34:57,430 --> 02:34:59,210
Same comp that we did game...

3866
02:35:01,930 --> 02:35:02,490
Horizon.

3867
02:35:03,350 --> 02:35:04,730
Yeah, Bang Horizon.

3868
02:35:05,970 --> 02:35:06,390
Pathfinder.

3869
02:35:07,010 --> 02:35:07,290
Alright.

3870
02:35:11,010 --> 02:35:11,450
Okay.

3871
02:35:14,670 --> 02:35:19,370
In the rules, I said they're gonna ban Legends from game 3, so it would be 6 bans, not 3.

3872
02:35:19,710 --> 02:35:21,730
Yeah, somebody called them out on it.

3873
02:35:22,310 --> 02:35:23,430
Sometimes people lie.

3874
02:35:23,850 --> 02:35:25,750
Oh, and then Maddie's like, nah, nevermind.

3875
02:35:26,770 --> 02:35:27,890
Maddie didn't give a fuck.

3876
02:35:28,270 --> 02:35:36,010
No, they literally went, these guys have failed picking heroes 5 million times, adding 3 more to it is gonna make it impossible for these motherfuckers to win.

3877
02:35:37,290 --> 02:35:38,750
That's so true.

3878
02:35:42,270 --> 02:35:46,230
We've already are almost an hour over time.

3879
02:35:53,990 --> 02:35:55,630
You got some plans tonight?

3880
02:35:56,510 --> 02:35:57,570
Path of Exile.

3881
02:35:58,250 --> 02:35:59,270
A Boonstone fight.

3882
02:35:59,530 --> 02:36:00,290
My second stream.

3883
02:36:04,370 --> 02:36:05,370
Let's see.

3884
02:36:05,910 --> 02:36:10,110
Oh, so we're gonna do Bang Path and...

3885
02:36:10,110 --> 02:36:10,790
Oh, what was it?

3886
02:36:10,790 --> 02:36:12,990
Bang Path and...

3887
02:36:12,990 --> 02:36:14,370
Okay, Bang Path, Horizon.

3888
02:36:14,730 --> 02:36:15,610
And you're gonna DC.

3889
02:36:16,070 --> 02:36:20,170
And I went DC, and you guys are gonna play again without me.

3890
02:36:21,010 --> 02:36:21,270
Yeah.

3891
02:36:22,330 --> 02:36:23,670
Only the top 3 teams win.

3892
02:36:24,730 --> 02:36:25,350
So no kills.

3893
02:36:26,130 --> 02:36:26,630
Kills don't matter.

3894
02:36:27,490 --> 02:36:29,490
That being said, we're killing everybody.

3895
02:36:29,770 --> 02:36:30,810
Wait, kills don't matter?

3896
02:36:31,050 --> 02:36:32,090
Should we play zone then?

3897
02:36:35,430 --> 02:36:38,550
When everyone's playing zone, we counter the lobby.

3898
02:36:39,010 --> 02:36:40,490
Oh, okay.

3899
02:36:41,170 --> 02:36:42,790
I get it, I get it.

3900
02:36:43,150 --> 02:36:43,730
Trust, trust.

3901
02:36:46,110 --> 02:36:47,430
I don't know what's up with this server.

3902
02:36:47,650 --> 02:36:48,550
I keep DCing.

3903
02:36:49,090 --> 02:36:50,550
I don't really know how to play zone, I'm not gonna lie.

3904
02:36:50,630 --> 02:36:51,370
I only know how to like...

3905
02:36:51,370 --> 02:36:53,210
Oh, you're not the zone reader, right?

3906
02:36:53,770 --> 02:36:54,130
Nope.

3907
02:36:55,970 --> 02:36:57,330
Wait, who's the zone reader on your team?

3908
02:36:58,210 --> 02:37:03,030
Well, we kind of all read zones, but our team has always played edge.

3909
02:37:03,510 --> 02:37:05,490
Oh, so you're just the fragger.

3910
02:37:05,970 --> 02:37:06,630
Yeah, yeah.

3911
02:37:06,650 --> 02:37:08,230
You're just there to frag.

3912
02:37:09,150 --> 02:37:11,830
We're known as the team that's like, we'll just run it down.

3913
02:37:13,330 --> 02:37:15,210
We just grief people.

3914
02:37:15,850 --> 02:37:18,590
Oh, so you believe in us to be able to do that, basically.

3915
02:37:18,590 --> 02:37:18,890
Oh, yeah.

3916
02:37:20,830 --> 02:37:22,910
I'm assuming that we are the best fighting team in this lobby.

3917
02:37:23,110 --> 02:37:23,450
You know what?

3918
02:37:23,490 --> 02:37:24,850
I believe, I agree too.

3919
02:37:24,950 --> 02:37:28,190
Even though I wasn't there in match 3, I agree with that.

3920
02:37:28,370 --> 02:37:30,590
Imagine if Yogi was there, just hard carrying us that game.

3921
02:37:30,630 --> 02:37:35,870
Yeah, while I was fishing, while I was fishing, that was just all me.

3922
02:37:39,540 --> 02:37:40,720
It's the same map again.

3923
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:41,740
Or, e-district again.

3924
02:37:42,300 --> 02:37:43,060
Oh, okay.

3925
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:43,700
Oh, it is!

3926
02:37:43,960 --> 02:37:45,120
It's basically a repeat!

3927
02:37:45,340 --> 02:37:45,760
Let's go!

3928
02:37:47,100 --> 02:37:50,500
Same strategy, we're just gonna int face.

3929
02:37:59,770 --> 02:38:00,510
Is it starting?

3930
02:38:02,510 --> 02:38:03,990
Start the lobby.

3931
02:38:04,110 --> 02:38:05,370
They said start in 10 seconds.

3932
02:38:05,530 --> 02:38:07,910
Oh, Rampart is banned.

3933
02:38:08,090 --> 02:38:08,510
Apparently.

3934
02:38:11,330 --> 02:38:12,290
Rampart is banned.

3935
02:38:12,590 --> 02:38:13,650
Rampart, Gibby, Newcastle.

3936
02:38:14,390 --> 02:38:15,570
Dang, why did he ban Rampart?

3937
02:38:16,030 --> 02:38:18,510
Because people were planning on using Rampart with the gun lock.

3938
02:38:23,870 --> 02:38:25,610
Yeah, I would recommend Spitfire.

3939
02:38:26,650 --> 02:38:34,790
I would do Spitfire, L-Star, Rampage, Devotion, in that order.

3940
02:38:35,350 --> 02:38:35,710
Okay.

3941
02:38:35,870 --> 02:38:36,870
We're trying to pick LMGs.

3942
02:38:39,130 --> 02:38:39,690
Spitfire's the best.

3943
02:38:48,760 --> 02:38:49,080
Okay.

3944
02:38:50,440 --> 02:38:51,160
Rampage ain't bad, though.

3945
02:38:51,200 --> 02:38:53,300
If you get some Thermites for the Rampage, it's actually the best.

3946
02:38:53,420 --> 02:38:53,960
But you need Thermites.

3947
02:38:54,120 --> 02:38:55,960
Yeah, but that's a little too much work.

3948
02:38:56,680 --> 02:38:57,240
Yeah, that's a lot of work.

3949
02:38:57,520 --> 02:38:59,180
Where is the angle door?

3950
02:39:05,850 --> 02:39:06,270
Let's go.

3951
02:39:06,330 --> 02:39:07,250
I'm feeling a massive W here.

3952
02:39:07,290 --> 02:39:08,130
I think this is our map.

3953
02:39:08,590 --> 02:39:08,930
Oh, yeah.

3954
02:39:09,370 --> 02:39:09,990
This is it.

3955
02:39:10,070 --> 02:39:11,370
This is where we're gonna win.

3956
02:39:12,390 --> 02:39:14,190
There's gonna be no disconnects.

3957
02:39:14,910 --> 02:39:16,170
There's gonna be no disconnects.

3958
02:39:16,170 --> 02:39:17,930
We're gonna hear all the Apex audio.

3959
02:39:18,830 --> 02:39:23,690
And then, Evan's gonna get like 500 kills for us.

3960
02:39:24,770 --> 02:39:26,510
Yeah, that's what we like to see.

3961
02:39:26,870 --> 02:39:27,650
Yes, yes, yes.

3962
02:39:28,770 --> 02:39:31,470
If he doesn't get 500 kills, he gets kicked off of TSM.

3963
02:39:31,590 --> 02:39:33,470
Oh, let's go!

3964
02:39:33,910 --> 02:39:35,290
Let's freaking go!

3965
02:39:36,230 --> 02:39:37,170
Ah, Sheeper.

3966
02:39:39,430 --> 02:39:40,930
Looks like no one's landing here.

3967
02:39:42,490 --> 02:39:43,670
I'm going to my slot.

3968
02:39:43,670 --> 02:39:47,010
I can't wait for like when...

3969
02:39:47,370 --> 02:39:51,170
The moment we touch the ground, it ends the match.

3970
02:39:51,370 --> 02:39:54,030
Someone has picked the wrong hero.

3971
02:39:55,030 --> 02:39:56,810
Oh, wait, you can.

3972
02:39:58,110 --> 02:39:59,270
Should you pick up the right guns?

3973
02:39:59,370 --> 02:40:00,390
I just picked up an alternator.

3974
02:40:01,970 --> 02:40:02,490
Oopsies.

3975
02:40:03,410 --> 02:40:09,090
I have control and I'm not picking up the guns I can't use.

3976
02:40:13,520 --> 02:40:15,640
Alright, I need to find a master.

3977
02:40:18,400 --> 02:40:19,550
I got my shotgun LMG.

3978
02:40:20,440 --> 02:40:21,320
I found...

3979
02:40:21,320 --> 02:40:22,100
Oh, I got a Spitfire.

3980
02:40:22,840 --> 02:40:23,400
Zero weapons.

3981
02:40:23,940 --> 02:40:26,920
Oh, no!

3982
02:40:27,860 --> 02:40:29,020
I'm so cursed.

3983
02:40:29,640 --> 02:40:30,040
I'm getting off.

3984
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:33,000
Our entire team just leaves.

3985
02:40:35,780 --> 02:40:37,460
Just don't let them play!

3986
02:40:37,540 --> 02:40:38,860
I freaking fished!

3987
02:40:41,420 --> 02:40:42,080
I'm...

3988
02:40:45,130 --> 02:40:47,420
We need some monetary...

3989
02:40:48,300 --> 02:40:50,120
That's two days we get hot zone and they restart.

3990
02:40:51,210 --> 02:40:52,740
They didn't restart for me!

3991
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:54,420
I literally fished!

3992
02:40:54,420 --> 02:40:57,000
I fished and it was okay with me!

3993
02:40:57,660 --> 02:40:59,080
Let them fish!

3994
02:41:04,620 --> 02:41:06,480
No, somebody crashed.

3995
02:41:06,740 --> 02:41:07,320
It was Zero.

3996
02:41:07,680 --> 02:41:08,880
ZeroPlus crashed.

3997
02:41:11,420 --> 02:41:12,560
Somebody picked Gibraltar.

3998
02:41:12,880 --> 02:41:14,400
Wait, somebody picked Gibraltar?

3999
02:41:14,860 --> 02:41:15,700
Wait, you're right!

4000
02:41:15,960 --> 02:41:17,520
Somebody picked Gibraltar.

4001
02:41:18,160 --> 02:41:18,740
Yeah.

4002
02:41:20,680 --> 02:41:21,860
What the fuck?

4003
02:41:22,240 --> 02:41:23,160
Who was H.A.

4004
02:41:23,480 --> 02:41:24,100
Hakeem?

4005
02:41:24,620 --> 02:41:25,740
It was Pariah Carey.

4006
02:41:26,780 --> 02:41:28,540
Who the fuck was it?

4007
02:41:28,540 --> 02:41:29,360
I'm starting to get mad.

4008
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:31,100
Let's all just leave.

4009
02:41:32,500 --> 02:41:33,460
I'm going on strike.

4010
02:41:34,460 --> 02:41:35,600
Never again.

4011
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:36,360
Never again.

4012
02:41:38,220 --> 02:41:39,620
We're never coming back.

4013
02:41:39,720 --> 02:41:40,380
It's your fault.

4014
02:41:42,120 --> 02:41:44,920
Why don't we all leave and just play quick play?

4015
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:54,420
Names are fine.

4016
02:41:56,380 --> 02:41:57,680
You guys want to go grind for predator after this?

4017
02:41:58,160 --> 02:41:58,620
Yeah, sure.

4018
02:41:59,660 --> 02:42:01,360
Let's just leave now and do it.

4019
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:03,120
We can do it in a night, right?

4020
02:42:03,340 --> 02:42:03,700
Yeah.

4021
02:42:04,800 --> 02:42:06,140
Yeah, if we win a couple games.

4022
02:42:07,140 --> 02:42:10,140
They're starting the server and Giga is missing too.

4023
02:42:13,280 --> 02:42:14,300
They're just done.

4024
02:42:24,290 --> 02:42:24,850
Toxky.

4025
02:42:25,650 --> 02:42:26,650
Oh my god, are we?

4026
02:42:26,970 --> 02:42:27,850
No, just started.

4027
02:42:28,530 --> 02:42:29,090
Please!

4028
02:42:32,310 --> 02:42:32,870
Please!

4029
02:42:34,290 --> 02:42:36,930
When's your second stream even supposed to be?

4030
02:42:36,930 --> 02:42:38,990
I'm playing a fan game.

4031
02:42:39,410 --> 02:42:41,150
My fans made me a game.

4032
02:42:41,670 --> 02:42:42,550
No, they cannot.

4033
02:42:42,650 --> 02:42:43,630
I refuse.

4034
02:42:44,870 --> 02:42:45,930
It's not going anywhere.

4035
02:42:47,570 --> 02:42:49,330
Are you trying to say my time is not important?

4036
02:42:50,290 --> 02:42:50,470
Yeah.

4037
02:42:51,010 --> 02:42:51,430
Wow.

4038
02:42:55,090 --> 02:42:56,330
VTubers are weird.

4039
02:42:56,930 --> 02:42:58,730
They make stream plans.

4040
02:43:00,470 --> 02:43:06,110
They stream on YouTube and they have things called waiting rooms where they schedule the streams.

4041
02:43:09,630 --> 02:43:13,410
Each stream is themed around the game that we're playing on.

4042
02:43:13,650 --> 02:43:16,750
Unlike Twitch, we can't just swap games and then change the category.

4043
02:43:17,290 --> 02:43:18,910
How long have we been here for?

4044
02:43:19,030 --> 02:43:21,430
We've been streaming for two hours and 43 minutes.

4045
02:43:22,690 --> 02:43:24,210
Doki's reaching her breaking point.

4046
02:43:25,230 --> 02:43:26,530
That's not true.

4047
02:43:26,530 --> 02:43:28,730
She's literally about to be working overtime.

4048
02:43:29,590 --> 02:43:30,450
That's not true.

4049
02:43:30,470 --> 02:43:32,090
I have a second stream.

4050
02:43:32,090 --> 02:43:34,230
They stream for like two or three hours.

4051
02:43:34,330 --> 02:43:35,230
That's true, though.

4052
02:43:35,550 --> 02:43:39,570
A lot of VTubers on YouTube just usually go like two to three hours because that's our stamina.

4053
02:43:40,270 --> 02:43:43,630
Oh man, that was a long stream today, guys.

4054
02:43:43,910 --> 02:43:45,230
Good stream, guys.

4055
02:43:45,950 --> 02:43:48,530
I'm going to go on a week break now.

4056
02:43:49,950 --> 02:43:51,030
That's not me.

4057
02:43:51,310 --> 02:43:52,870
You guys are non-stop high energy.

4058
02:43:54,010 --> 02:43:56,770
Yeah, because we stream two to three hours.

4059
02:43:58,430 --> 02:44:01,350
We have the energy to do that.

4060
02:44:03,630 --> 02:44:05,590
I'm at the nine-hour mark and I'm about to fall asleep.

4061
02:44:05,770 --> 02:44:07,150
You're at the nine-hour mark?

4062
02:44:07,270 --> 02:44:09,110
Oh yeah, you had like scrims.

4063
02:44:09,370 --> 02:44:10,850
Yeah, I had scrims at nine in the morning.

4064
02:44:11,130 --> 02:44:14,470
This custom is like right after like...

4065
02:44:14,470 --> 02:44:18,230
Our hotspot is gone, guys.

4066
02:44:18,250 --> 02:44:19,290
Our hotspot's gone.

4067
02:44:19,350 --> 02:44:20,570
We literally are so far.

4068
02:44:20,650 --> 02:44:21,490
We're not even going to reach the building.

4069
02:44:28,570 --> 02:44:31,690
Some of the Hololive VTubers haven't streamed in like two months.

4070
02:44:34,310 --> 02:44:35,990
Yeah, but they have passive income.

4071
02:44:36,830 --> 02:44:38,090
Dude, that must be lit.

4072
02:44:41,210 --> 02:44:41,650
Why?

4073
02:44:42,250 --> 02:44:43,610
We don't even have hotspots.

4074
02:44:43,610 --> 02:44:45,650
Why are they contesting us all of a sudden?

4075
02:44:45,650 --> 02:44:46,710
I'm pretty sure they're going Galleria.

4076
02:44:46,850 --> 02:44:48,210
We don't even have hotspots.

4077
02:44:48,750 --> 02:44:50,530
It looks like they're fucking...

4078
02:44:50,530 --> 02:44:51,130
No, they're coming.

4079
02:44:51,430 --> 02:44:54,010
Why are they coming here all of a sudden, bro?

4080
02:44:55,330 --> 02:44:57,070
What the fuck is wrong with you?

4081
02:44:57,530 --> 02:44:58,250
We've raced to the top.

4082
02:44:58,730 --> 02:45:01,490
Alright, I can queue us.

4083
02:45:03,270 --> 02:45:04,590
Well, they have to get the guns.

4084
02:45:04,710 --> 02:45:06,290
They can't fight us if they don't have the guns.

4085
02:45:10,450 --> 02:45:13,010
Oh my god, let's hope we find the guns for this first.

4086
02:45:14,430 --> 02:45:15,670
I don't have a shotgun.

4087
02:45:17,250 --> 02:45:18,070
I don't have a gun.

4088
02:45:18,570 --> 02:45:19,810
There's a Spitfire right here.

4089
02:45:20,970 --> 02:45:22,930
I'll give it to you guys because one of you guys need a gun.

4090
02:45:24,610 --> 02:45:25,710
Grab the Spitfire.

4091
02:45:26,390 --> 02:45:27,510
I'll come to that in a sec.

4092
02:45:29,310 --> 02:45:30,470
What's wrong with them?

4093
02:45:30,810 --> 02:45:31,690
I grabbed the Spitfire.

4094
02:45:33,730 --> 02:45:35,070
There's another Spitfire up here.

4095
02:45:35,170 --> 02:45:36,050
There's another Spitfire up here.

4096
02:45:36,170 --> 02:45:36,790
Okay, grab it.

4097
02:45:41,030 --> 02:45:42,390
This team probably just dipped out.

4098
02:45:42,770 --> 02:45:43,930
What the fuck is wrong with them?

4099
02:45:43,950 --> 02:45:45,490
They landed on us and just dipped?

4100
02:45:45,750 --> 02:45:47,730
What kind of fucking nerds?

4101
02:45:50,410 --> 02:45:51,310
I don't see them.

4102
02:45:52,010 --> 02:45:53,990
I don't see them either, but I'm scared.

4103
02:45:54,990 --> 02:45:55,510
I'm not.

4104
02:45:57,810 --> 02:45:59,130
He said we need to...

4105
02:45:59,130 --> 02:46:02,530
I mean, they haven't dropped the whole time.

4106
02:46:02,670 --> 02:46:03,590
Now they're dropping now.

4107
02:46:03,730 --> 02:46:05,150
Which team is it?

4108
02:46:08,330 --> 02:46:09,570
I'm starting to get angry.

4109
02:46:14,030 --> 02:46:15,190
I dropped down.

4110
02:46:15,350 --> 02:46:16,030
I'm looking.

4111
02:46:17,530 --> 02:46:19,030
I'm pretty sure they just ran away.

4112
02:46:20,430 --> 02:46:21,970
What the fuck is wrong with them?

4113
02:46:22,150 --> 02:46:25,110
They thought we would veer and be bitches, but we fucking held our ground.

4114
02:46:25,110 --> 02:46:25,630
Yeah.

4115
02:46:27,370 --> 02:46:28,630
The server is lagging.

4116
02:46:28,950 --> 02:46:30,470
I'm spiking to 100 ping.

4117
02:46:30,770 --> 02:46:32,030
Oh no, you got the curse.

4118
02:46:32,170 --> 02:46:33,070
Now it's your turn.

4119
02:46:34,290 --> 02:46:34,690
Uh oh.

4120
02:46:36,430 --> 02:46:38,210
The zone might be on top of our heads.

4121
02:46:38,750 --> 02:46:39,170
Oh.

4122
02:46:40,270 --> 02:46:44,150
I'm going to be next to Rahul so I know I'm protected.

4123
02:46:44,610 --> 02:46:45,770
So I know I can feel safe.

4124
02:46:46,870 --> 02:46:47,450
I'll take it.

4125
02:46:48,730 --> 02:46:50,870
I'm next to you so I can be safe.

4126
02:46:52,730 --> 02:46:54,000
I'm looting so I can die.

4127
02:46:55,530 --> 02:46:56,190
It's alright.

4128
02:46:58,130 --> 02:47:00,390
If you die in Apex, you die in real life.

4129
02:47:03,570 --> 02:47:04,270
Eva here.

4130
02:47:07,470 --> 02:47:08,810
Eva is typically better than the PK.

4131
02:47:09,410 --> 02:47:10,270
I have the Mastiff.

4132
02:47:10,910 --> 02:47:11,690
Okay, that's good.

4133
02:47:14,370 --> 02:47:15,770
Can we go together?

4134
02:47:16,470 --> 02:47:17,750
Oh my god, this Eva is crazy.

4135
02:47:17,750 --> 02:47:18,210
Where do we go?

4136
02:47:21,530 --> 02:47:22,590
Nobody is dead.

4137
02:47:22,810 --> 02:47:23,750
Everybody is tired.

4138
02:47:25,190 --> 02:47:26,850
Maybe we should sit on our building for a bit.

4139
02:47:27,090 --> 02:47:27,910
The zone might be on us.

4140
02:47:28,750 --> 02:47:30,070
We have nothing though.

4141
02:47:31,170 --> 02:47:34,390
If the zone is on us, we're going to have regretted moving.

4142
02:47:38,920 --> 02:47:40,500
I feel like people would be on us already.

4143
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:44,380
People rotate fucking fast.

4144
02:47:50,730 --> 02:47:53,190
It's got to be a stadium zone if it's not pointing to us.

4145
02:47:53,850 --> 02:47:58,210
I feel like if it was on us, there would be like 200 people already.

4146
02:47:58,670 --> 02:47:59,290
It seems we're here.

4147
02:48:01,410 --> 02:48:03,030
I need a scope.

4148
02:48:05,230 --> 02:48:07,150
We don't have Evas close by.

4149
02:48:12,720 --> 02:48:15,760
We got really unlucky with Evo spawns.

4150
02:48:16,280 --> 02:48:17,880
We have a ring console here.

4151
02:48:17,880 --> 02:48:18,420
Let's go get this Eva over here.

4152
02:48:20,760 --> 02:48:21,520
I'm running.

4153
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:22,100
We'll come back.

4154
02:48:22,100 --> 02:48:23,260
I'll wait.

4155
02:48:25,120 --> 02:48:27,260
I think the zone is to our south.

4156
02:48:27,360 --> 02:48:27,720
I'm not sure.

4157
02:48:31,830 --> 02:48:33,850
It's time to edge.

4158
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:39,480
Where the fuck is the door if we're here?

4159
02:48:40,760 --> 02:48:41,880
Hello Ice King.

4160
02:48:42,700 --> 02:48:43,700
Yo, what's good?

4161
02:48:44,740 --> 02:48:45,480
Could be better.

4162
02:48:45,700 --> 02:48:48,040
Spitfire has a fucking...

4163
02:48:48,040 --> 02:48:49,100
It's a guy in front of me.

4164
02:48:49,220 --> 02:48:51,660
It's a guy in front of me.

4165
02:48:51,780 --> 02:48:52,540
It's a Wraith.

4166
02:48:53,160 --> 02:48:54,200
We're here too.

4167
02:48:56,260 --> 02:48:56,980
He was over here.

4168
02:48:57,080 --> 02:48:57,720
He ran into this alleyway.

4169
02:48:58,860 --> 02:48:59,520
That'd be a solo.

4170
02:48:59,760 --> 02:49:00,120
I'm not sure.

4171
02:49:00,160 --> 02:49:00,860
Where is his team?

4172
02:49:01,460 --> 02:49:03,240
I feel like his team could be nearby.

4173
02:49:04,700 --> 02:49:05,820
I hear him sliding.

4174
02:49:07,480 --> 02:49:08,240
On the outside of this thing.

4175
02:49:09,100 --> 02:49:10,200
I think it's a solo Wraith.

4176
02:49:10,300 --> 02:49:11,080
I swear to God.

4177
02:49:12,920 --> 02:49:13,560
He just...

4178
02:49:13,560 --> 02:49:15,360
Watch out.

4179
02:49:15,840 --> 02:49:16,340
On the left.

4180
02:49:17,740 --> 02:49:19,140
Oh, I got hit.

4181
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:20,740
Life flash.

4182
02:49:21,140 --> 02:49:21,760
I downed one.

4183
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:23,960
I can't see shit.

4184
02:49:25,460 --> 02:49:26,240
He charged that.

4185
02:49:26,340 --> 02:49:26,820
I need a heal.

4186
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:28,040
It's just one left.

4187
02:49:29,740 --> 02:49:30,620
That's on you.

4188
02:49:32,060 --> 02:49:32,940
You got this, right?

4189
02:49:33,420 --> 02:49:33,820
Cracked him.

4190
02:49:35,440 --> 02:49:36,280
Come to me when you can.

4191
02:49:36,880 --> 02:49:38,020
Yeah, I'm grabbing his shield.

4192
02:49:38,800 --> 02:49:39,340
I'm here.

4193
02:49:40,400 --> 02:49:41,460
Hey, it's code Mandy.

4194
02:49:46,490 --> 02:49:47,310
I need a heal.

4195
02:49:47,810 --> 02:49:48,370
Heal him.

4196
02:49:55,510 --> 02:49:55,970
Heal him.

4197
02:49:55,970 --> 02:49:56,870
There we go.

4198
02:49:57,370 --> 02:49:59,210
Where's the other guy that died?

4199
02:49:59,350 --> 02:49:59,850
Oh, there he is.

4200
02:50:00,750 --> 02:50:01,950
He has a Spitfire too.

4201
02:50:02,670 --> 02:50:03,470
I need a light mag if you see.

4202
02:50:05,030 --> 02:50:05,330
Nope.

4203
02:50:07,130 --> 02:50:08,450
Man, these guys have light mags.

4204
02:50:08,510 --> 02:50:09,130
That's pretty cursed.

4205
02:50:09,350 --> 02:50:09,550
Nope.

4206
02:50:10,970 --> 02:50:12,250
No light mag.

4207
02:50:12,630 --> 02:50:13,350
Light mags.

4208
02:50:13,610 --> 02:50:15,090
Where's the guy you killed?

4209
02:50:16,910 --> 02:50:18,270
Let's get the Evo here.

4210
02:50:18,450 --> 02:50:19,270
He's under you.

4211
02:50:19,470 --> 02:50:20,530
Oh, it's fine.

4212
02:50:20,830 --> 02:50:21,810
I don't need his body.

4213
02:50:22,090 --> 02:50:23,950
It's useless to me.

4214
02:50:24,550 --> 02:50:25,150
Oh, that's the first team!

4215
02:50:26,330 --> 02:50:27,950
That's the first team that died!

4216
02:50:28,690 --> 02:50:29,270
That's right.

4217
02:50:29,350 --> 02:50:31,830
Now you gotta watch us because there's still one more game left.

4218
02:50:35,840 --> 02:50:36,720
This team might look ridiculous here.

4219
02:50:37,480 --> 02:50:37,880
Yeah.

4220
02:50:38,060 --> 02:50:39,200
There's a team literally in the stadium here.

4221
02:50:40,760 --> 02:50:41,960
Can we go hit this beacon?

4222
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:44,820
I'm with you.

4223
02:50:45,240 --> 02:50:46,400
We're right behind you.

4224
02:50:51,070 --> 02:50:51,610
They're close here.

4225
02:50:51,690 --> 02:50:52,610
No, they could be around the corner.

4226
02:50:53,810 --> 02:50:54,430
I'm wearing my mask.

4227
02:50:59,470 --> 02:51:01,310
There's a Loba ult right there.

4228
02:51:03,390 --> 02:51:04,350
They're right across here.

4229
02:51:05,270 --> 02:51:06,030
Or left.

4230
02:51:06,810 --> 02:51:07,150
That guy!

4231
02:51:08,310 --> 02:51:09,110
He's in the back corner.

4232
02:51:09,330 --> 02:51:09,630
You can kill him.

4233
02:51:10,390 --> 02:51:10,790
No, you can't.

4234
02:51:13,690 --> 02:51:14,450
Behind me!

4235
02:51:14,650 --> 02:51:16,090
Behind me!

4236
02:51:17,090 --> 02:51:17,850
No way.

4237
02:51:17,850 --> 02:51:19,010
That's a different team.

4238
02:51:19,310 --> 02:51:20,070
Strike it out.

4239
02:51:20,150 --> 02:51:21,050
Just run for your life.

4240
02:51:21,310 --> 02:51:21,890
That's a different team.

4241
02:51:21,950 --> 02:51:22,390
Just run.

4242
02:51:23,810 --> 02:51:24,330
What?

4243
02:51:24,710 --> 02:51:25,890
That's a different team!

4244
02:51:28,810 --> 02:51:30,430
What were they doing there?

4245
02:51:30,430 --> 02:51:31,590
They were ratting the beacon.

4246
02:51:32,670 --> 02:51:35,310
They were literally just ratting there.

4247
02:51:36,150 --> 02:51:37,970
We were about to hit the man stand too.

4248
02:51:39,790 --> 02:51:41,210
Oh my god.

4249
02:51:41,270 --> 02:51:43,110
They like hid in the fucking corner.

4250
02:51:43,550 --> 02:51:45,350
And now they're gonna fucking die.

4251
02:51:45,350 --> 02:51:47,650
They're gonna die for it!

4252
02:51:47,870 --> 02:51:49,050
I hate VTubers.

4253
02:51:49,430 --> 02:51:50,730
Oh my god.

4254
02:51:50,730 --> 02:51:52,150
That's so fucked.

4255
02:51:55,520 --> 02:51:57,900
I can't believe they ratted that.

4256
02:51:58,240 --> 02:51:58,840
Holy shit.

4257
02:51:58,860 --> 02:51:59,480
That is unfortunate.

4258
02:52:00,560 --> 02:52:01,240
That is so unfortunate.

4259
02:52:01,400 --> 02:52:03,180
We were about to hit the man stand.

4260
02:52:07,260 --> 02:52:09,640
Why do you camp?

4261
02:52:13,260 --> 02:52:14,220
That's crazy.

4262
02:52:14,220 --> 02:52:16,460
And they're gonna survive too because...

4263
02:52:21,940 --> 02:52:24,660
Because they just need to craft him.

4264
02:52:26,580 --> 02:52:28,020
But they're so split up.

4265
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:29,940
Hello darkness my old friend.

4266
02:52:32,400 --> 02:52:33,420
I can't believe it.

4267
02:52:33,940 --> 02:52:35,740
I can't believe we got ratted.

4268
02:52:38,280 --> 02:52:39,780
That's battle royales bro.

4269
02:52:39,960 --> 02:52:41,280
You live and die by the rats.

4270
02:52:44,220 --> 02:52:46,500
If we had an EvoCache...

4271
02:52:46,500 --> 02:52:48,220
Anywhere near us...

4272
02:52:48,220 --> 02:52:49,940
We wouldn't have gotten ratted on because I would have hit the heights beacon.

4273
02:52:53,080 --> 02:52:54,080
Yeah, if...

4274
02:52:54,080 --> 02:52:56,640
You know, if that person didn't pick fucking Gibraltar.

4275
02:52:56,880 --> 02:52:59,180
By the way, the team that picked Gibraltar died already.

4276
02:52:59,380 --> 02:53:01,280
Like died at like 19th place.

4277
02:53:01,620 --> 02:53:02,660
So it's like...

4278
02:53:02,660 --> 02:53:04,240
What was the point of restarting?

4279
02:53:07,120 --> 02:53:09,700
They already got knocked down!

4280
02:53:10,540 --> 02:53:10,980
Anyway...

4281
02:53:12,780 --> 02:53:15,080
They got knocked down in the restart.

4282
02:53:21,910 --> 02:53:22,890
I think it's the server.

4283
02:53:23,110 --> 02:53:25,910
The server code is like...

4284
02:53:25,910 --> 02:53:27,070
Why does he not shoot back?

4285
02:53:27,270 --> 02:53:28,090
Just shoot back.

4286
02:53:29,410 --> 02:53:30,470
He's so scared.

4287
02:53:31,410 --> 02:53:32,610
Just shoot back.

4288
02:53:34,690 --> 02:53:35,270
Oh, he's got teammates.

4289
02:53:35,490 --> 02:53:35,790
That's why.

4290
02:53:35,890 --> 02:53:38,350
I don't think those were teammates.

4291
02:53:38,850 --> 02:53:40,850
No, he got knocked.

4292
02:53:40,850 --> 02:53:42,010
So he was a teammate.

4293
02:53:42,210 --> 02:53:43,290
He got knocked though.

4294
02:53:45,790 --> 02:53:46,950
Mythic supply bin.

4295
02:53:50,170 --> 02:53:50,890
Get this team out.

4296
02:53:51,010 --> 02:53:51,590
Get this team out.

4297
02:53:51,670 --> 02:53:52,130
They killed us.

4298
02:53:53,590 --> 02:53:54,650
Oh my god.

4299
02:53:56,790 --> 02:53:57,670
Get him out!

4300
02:53:58,770 --> 02:53:59,870
That's for killing us.

4301
02:53:59,950 --> 02:54:01,430
There was no reason to kill us there.

4302
02:54:03,930 --> 02:54:05,310
Wait, what the fuck?

4303
02:54:05,370 --> 02:54:06,390
They had two knocks?

4304
02:54:06,390 --> 02:54:07,790
Oh, because there's another third party.

4305
02:54:11,780 --> 02:54:13,460
We got greased so hard.

4306
02:54:17,390 --> 02:54:18,850
That's karma, exactly.

4307
02:54:20,390 --> 02:54:21,650
Next match is...

4308
02:54:21,650 --> 02:54:22,710
Melee and grenades.

4309
02:54:22,950 --> 02:54:24,370
I feel like we have to play Wattson.

4310
02:54:25,070 --> 02:54:26,130
Melee and grenades?

4311
02:54:26,730 --> 02:54:27,610
Oh jeez.

4312
02:54:28,970 --> 02:54:30,970
I guess I can play Fuse, unless you want Fuse.

4313
02:54:31,330 --> 02:54:32,030
No, I can play Wattson.

4314
02:54:33,890 --> 02:54:35,490
Do they ban Fuse?

4315
02:54:36,270 --> 02:54:38,210
I mean, I guess Horizon is good for that.

4316
02:54:38,210 --> 02:54:40,770
Because then you can also go in the air to dodge all the nades.

4317
02:54:40,910 --> 02:54:41,510
That's true.

4318
02:54:42,150 --> 02:54:46,990
But do we not want the Wattson ult for the...

4319
02:54:46,990 --> 02:54:49,070
Yeah, but doesn't Wattson ult stop your own grenades?

4320
02:54:49,570 --> 02:54:51,790
Yeah, but then it stops their grenades too.

4321
02:54:52,650 --> 02:54:54,070
I will be playing Wraith.

4322
02:54:54,890 --> 02:54:55,650
Wraith and Ashe?

4323
02:54:56,310 --> 02:54:56,750
Yep.

4324
02:54:57,470 --> 02:54:58,010
Just for endgame.

4325
02:54:59,150 --> 02:54:59,950
That's true.

4326
02:55:00,430 --> 02:55:01,210
You got the phase.

4327
02:55:02,670 --> 02:55:05,050
Oh, someone should play Crypto.

4328
02:55:05,050 --> 02:55:07,810
Wait, I can play Crypto and just like...

4329
02:55:07,810 --> 02:55:08,050
Why is Crypto good?

4330
02:55:08,210 --> 02:55:10,210
Because I can EMP all the Wattson ults.

4331
02:55:11,370 --> 02:55:13,850
I don't think they're going to allow damage dealing abilities.

4332
02:55:14,310 --> 02:55:15,870
I don't think so.

4333
02:55:15,950 --> 02:55:16,470
You have to ask them.

4334
02:55:17,190 --> 02:55:17,910
I'd ask them about Crypto.

4335
02:55:18,350 --> 02:55:20,930
Okay, so then Wattson can't put fences then.

4336
02:55:21,230 --> 02:55:22,170
We're not allowed to.

4337
02:55:25,820 --> 02:55:26,800
Well, I don't know.

4338
02:55:28,800 --> 02:55:29,460
I don't know.

4339
02:55:29,540 --> 02:55:31,760
I don't know if they're allowing damage dealing abilities or not.

4340
02:55:32,440 --> 02:55:34,380
We can ask them now since we're AFK.

4341
02:55:34,380 --> 02:55:34,500
Okay.

4342
02:55:35,100 --> 02:55:38,600
Our best game was literally the first ALGS game.

4343
02:55:42,840 --> 02:55:46,080
We were fucking farming there.

4344
02:55:47,180 --> 02:55:49,380
And then we get fucking ratted.

4345
02:55:54,790 --> 02:55:57,450
What sucks is that I always get shot first too.

4346
02:55:57,990 --> 02:55:59,090
So stupid.

4347
02:56:00,670 --> 02:56:02,450
I'm always the one that gets shot first.

4348
02:56:02,450 --> 02:56:04,270
I instantly just exploded on you.

4349
02:56:04,410 --> 02:56:05,650
Like, why me?

4350
02:56:05,750 --> 02:56:06,990
Why did they pick me?

4351
02:56:08,890 --> 02:56:10,710
They could have picked anybody else.

4352
02:56:10,790 --> 02:56:12,990
I'm the only one that's like the worst pick.

4353
02:56:13,150 --> 02:56:14,410
To get targeted.

4354
02:56:16,550 --> 02:56:19,870
Oh, each team must use Pathfinder, Octane, and Bloodhound.

4355
02:56:20,130 --> 02:56:20,330
Oh.

4356
02:56:21,950 --> 02:56:22,490
Okay.

4357
02:56:22,770 --> 02:56:24,290
I didn't know that.

4358
02:56:25,350 --> 02:56:28,450
I guess I'll do...

4359
02:56:29,290 --> 02:56:30,330
I'll do...

4360
02:56:30,330 --> 02:56:31,570
Wait, what the fuck?

4361
02:56:31,850 --> 02:56:32,830
Why Bloodhound?

4362
02:56:34,010 --> 02:56:35,470
I guess scanning?

4363
02:56:39,680 --> 02:56:41,500
Octane's gonna be completely useless.

4364
02:56:42,360 --> 02:56:42,940
Jump pad!

4365
02:56:43,260 --> 02:56:44,160
You can jump pad people.

4366
02:56:44,560 --> 02:56:48,340
I guess you could try and jump pad somebody in the zone.

4367
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:50,120
Yeah, it's jump pad and then arc star.

4368
02:56:50,220 --> 02:56:51,580
Oh yeah, no, no, that's basically it.

4369
02:56:51,640 --> 02:56:54,280
You throw jump pads in the final circle.

4370
02:56:54,600 --> 02:56:57,680
So it causes everybody to jump into the zone.

4371
02:56:58,520 --> 02:57:00,580
Would you rather play Octane or Bloodhound?

4372
02:57:01,760 --> 02:57:02,200
Uh...

4373
02:57:02,200 --> 02:57:03,640
Alright, so we're winning this next one, right?

4374
02:57:03,880 --> 02:57:06,820
Yeah, sure, you want Octane, Bloodhound, or Path?

4375
02:57:09,260 --> 02:57:10,740
Wait, what do we need Bloodhound for?

4376
02:57:11,220 --> 02:57:12,800
Well, it's locked in.

4377
02:57:13,040 --> 02:57:13,740
It's locked in.

4378
02:57:15,040 --> 02:57:16,540
I can be the blue hunter.

4379
02:57:17,180 --> 02:57:17,540
Alright.

4380
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:19,860
I'm good with either Octane or Pathfinder.

4381
02:57:22,400 --> 02:57:23,800
If you have a preference.

4382
02:57:25,140 --> 02:57:26,660
We'll play Pathfinder again.

4383
02:57:26,880 --> 02:57:28,560
Alright, then I'll do Octane.

4384
02:57:28,560 --> 02:57:30,000
I'm going to throw jump pads at people.

4385
02:57:31,480 --> 02:57:31,800
So...

4386
02:57:31,800 --> 02:57:34,300
You guys should know that Pathfinder's purple zipline.

4387
02:57:35,860 --> 02:57:38,300
It makes you take half damage if you get the purple perk.

4388
02:57:38,880 --> 02:57:39,100
Yeah.

4389
02:57:40,160 --> 02:57:42,080
And that also applies to the zone.

4390
02:57:42,280 --> 02:57:44,340
So if you put a Pathfinder zipline at the end of the game and just take it.

4391
02:57:44,660 --> 02:57:45,520
The zone will deal half damage.

4392
02:57:45,720 --> 02:57:49,180
Oh, that's so smart, but then everybody else is going to take your zipline.

4393
02:57:49,760 --> 02:57:50,100
I mean, yeah.

4394
02:57:50,920 --> 02:57:51,800
Everyone's going to be running ziplines at the end.

4395
02:57:51,980 --> 02:57:53,140
Everyone's going to take it.

4396
02:57:54,780 --> 02:57:57,540
The key will just be dodging all the grenades on the ground at the end of the game.

4397
02:57:57,540 --> 02:57:58,840
I don't know how we're going to do that.

4398
02:57:59,920 --> 02:58:02,940
I'm going to kill myself and throw arc stars on the ground.

4399
02:58:03,880 --> 02:58:06,220
I'm going to do that and see how many people die from it.

4400
02:58:06,820 --> 02:58:08,760
Alright, so one of you guys in game.

4401
02:58:08,800 --> 02:58:10,480
Can you still stick arc stars to teammates?

4402
02:58:10,660 --> 02:58:10,880
No.

4403
02:58:12,080 --> 02:58:13,560
We could have done an OG.

4404
02:58:14,360 --> 02:58:15,980
We could have done that in OG.

4405
02:58:16,500 --> 02:58:17,500
Why didn't we do that?

4406
02:58:19,880 --> 02:58:20,920
Just send Oki in?

4407
02:58:21,300 --> 02:58:23,180
Yeah, you could have sent me in.

4408
02:58:23,380 --> 02:58:24,340
I was going to die anyway.

4409
02:58:35,320 --> 02:58:36,040
Oh my god.

4410
02:58:36,100 --> 02:58:37,000
They stole his rez.

4411
02:58:37,160 --> 02:58:37,760
Shoot him.

4412
02:58:37,860 --> 02:58:38,780
Shoot the guy rezzing.

4413
02:58:40,380 --> 02:58:42,220
If you shot him earlier.

4414
02:58:44,360 --> 02:58:45,700
He didn't reload his shotgun.

4415
02:58:47,780 --> 02:58:48,180
Unless...

4416
02:58:48,180 --> 02:58:48,540
Oh my god.

4417
02:58:48,780 --> 02:58:51,100
Oh my god.

4418
02:58:52,260 --> 02:58:52,460
Movement.

4419
02:58:53,440 --> 02:58:54,800
He died for it.

4420
02:58:56,060 --> 02:58:56,940
He should have just committed.

4421
02:58:57,120 --> 02:58:58,240
He knew he was going to die.

4422
02:58:58,460 --> 02:58:59,300
He should have just committed.

4423
02:58:59,300 --> 02:58:59,800
He did it.

4424
02:59:01,280 --> 02:59:05,460
Oh, this guy could get third place.

4425
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:10,100
Yeah, that thing is freaking out.

4426
02:59:11,360 --> 02:59:12,760
Yeah, because it was...

4427
02:59:13,340 --> 02:59:13,820
Oh.

4428
02:59:15,180 --> 02:59:16,360
No money for you.

4429
02:59:22,200 --> 02:59:24,340
Hey, at least we got third place that one time.

4430
02:59:25,160 --> 02:59:25,440
Yeah.

4431
02:59:25,780 --> 02:59:27,280
That was definitely there for it.

4432
02:59:30,850 --> 02:59:32,790
Who is this guy I'm spectating anyway?

4433
02:59:32,870 --> 02:59:33,490
Who is he?

4434
02:59:33,490 --> 02:59:35,570
I don't know, but they're on a controller.

4435
02:59:36,250 --> 02:59:37,230
That's true, it's drifting.

4436
02:59:48,730 --> 02:59:49,210
Someone, please.

4437
02:59:49,650 --> 02:59:52,730
Someone who is playing the tournament, please open my stream.

4438
02:59:52,830 --> 02:59:54,630
So you can see this guy.

4439
02:59:55,390 --> 02:59:55,690
No.

4440
02:59:56,490 --> 02:59:58,250
It's technically not stream sniping.

4441
02:59:58,310 --> 02:59:59,490
Because I'm technically dead.

4442
03:00:16,290 --> 03:00:17,670
They're a controller player.

4443
03:00:21,900 --> 03:00:21,920
He could.

4444
03:00:22,340 --> 03:00:23,320
He could get third.

4445
03:00:23,940 --> 03:00:26,080
He's literally playing for placements.

4446
03:00:26,720 --> 03:00:27,600
He's rat jamming.

4447
03:00:29,880 --> 03:00:31,440
He's jamming, alright.

4448
03:00:33,440 --> 03:00:34,960
He's interchanging.

4449
03:00:38,020 --> 03:00:39,220
Doubting his next play.

4450
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,080
Oh, movement, movement.

4451
03:00:49,080 --> 03:00:49,160
Movement!

4452
03:00:57,690 --> 03:00:59,050
Is anyone casting this?

4453
03:00:59,110 --> 03:01:00,050
Yeah, Mandy is casting.

4454
03:01:02,470 --> 03:01:03,930
Tell us who this guy is.

4455
03:01:04,690 --> 03:01:05,430
If you find out.

4456
03:01:05,750 --> 03:01:07,410
Can you find a nice little rat spot?

4457
03:01:07,870 --> 03:01:09,010
There's one more solo in the lobby.

4458
03:01:09,110 --> 03:01:09,970
He needs to find that solo.

4459
03:01:11,610 --> 03:01:12,930
Pretty sure that solo is to his right.

4460
03:01:13,930 --> 03:01:14,790
Over there?

4461
03:01:15,750 --> 03:01:18,310
No, like straight to his west.

4462
03:01:18,630 --> 03:01:19,390
On the zone.

4463
03:01:19,710 --> 03:01:21,130
This is a pretty good spot though.

4464
03:01:22,310 --> 03:01:23,490
This is insane.

4465
03:01:23,490 --> 03:01:23,850
What?

4466
03:01:26,050 --> 03:01:27,410
This is insane.

4467
03:01:27,850 --> 03:01:28,790
Oh my god.

4468
03:01:28,930 --> 03:01:30,150
Wait, he's actually going to get third.

4469
03:01:31,530 --> 03:01:33,410
Oh, they got the other rat.

4470
03:01:34,250 --> 03:01:35,350
He's one placement away.

4471
03:01:37,670 --> 03:01:39,950
It's a rat, a duo, and a...

4472
03:01:39,950 --> 03:01:40,990
two three mans, I think.

4473
03:01:41,610 --> 03:01:43,310
Looks like the other team is about to die.

4474
03:01:43,490 --> 03:01:44,770
But then can he win the 1v3?

4475
03:01:45,070 --> 03:01:45,310
Yep.

4476
03:01:46,570 --> 03:01:47,670
Now he's third.

4477
03:01:47,670 --> 03:01:48,390
Wait, whoop.

4478
03:01:50,830 --> 03:01:52,070
Wait, he might get second.

4479
03:01:53,850 --> 03:01:54,950
I'm pretty sure one team is a duo.

4480
03:01:55,190 --> 03:01:56,350
So it's just who gets spotted first.

4481
03:01:56,470 --> 03:01:57,090
The duo or the solo.

4482
03:02:00,640 --> 03:02:03,480
Wait, Maday DC'd his own fucking custom?

4483
03:02:05,860 --> 03:02:06,780
No way.

4484
03:02:06,940 --> 03:02:09,040
No fucking way.

4485
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:12,540
He DC'd his own custom.

4486
03:02:15,340 --> 03:02:16,740
That's so funny.

4487
03:02:24,360 --> 03:02:26,100
Guys, I think they need a new code.

4488
03:02:26,660 --> 03:02:29,540
I think they need a new code.

4489
03:02:33,670 --> 03:02:34,750
Are these like...

4490
03:02:34,750 --> 03:02:36,370
No, they're not because we have to fly.

4491
03:02:36,630 --> 03:02:38,730
These are like literally like public codes.

4492
03:02:40,050 --> 03:02:43,050
Because I was like wondering if they're like dev...

4493
03:02:43,050 --> 03:02:45,090
Not dev codes, but like priority codes.

4494
03:02:50,030 --> 03:02:52,090
Now it's grenades and punching.

4495
03:02:52,710 --> 03:02:53,110
Yep.

4496
03:02:54,210 --> 03:02:55,030
All right.

4497
03:02:55,770 --> 03:02:56,530
Chill, guys.

4498
03:02:56,870 --> 03:02:57,610
Whose team was that?

4499
03:02:58,510 --> 03:03:00,050
Oh, I think it was enemy.

4500
03:03:00,510 --> 03:03:01,770
Yeah, that was enemy then.

4501
03:03:07,310 --> 03:03:08,830
Oh, FSH won two in a row.

4502
03:03:09,770 --> 03:03:10,210
SFH?

4503
03:03:10,690 --> 03:03:12,130
Whoa, rigged.

4504
03:03:14,530 --> 03:03:15,810
100% rigged.

4505
03:03:16,590 --> 03:03:17,810
They have two pro players.

4506
03:03:19,350 --> 03:03:20,230
I mean...

4507
03:03:20,230 --> 03:03:21,590
Yeah, they have two pros.

4508
03:03:21,750 --> 03:03:22,470
It is rigged.

4509
03:03:22,490 --> 03:03:24,190
Every time we get a hotspot, they restart.

4510
03:03:24,190 --> 03:03:25,010
Exactly!

4511
03:03:25,410 --> 03:03:28,350
We actually could have won at least two games.

4512
03:03:30,110 --> 03:03:31,210
We could have won two games.

4513
03:03:31,270 --> 03:03:31,990
We've been pretty cursed.

4514
03:03:32,130 --> 03:03:34,130
We got Rattalon, we got Doki D.C.

4515
03:03:34,450 --> 03:03:35,450
I got D.C.

4516
03:03:35,750 --> 03:03:36,810
Hot zones going away.

4517
03:03:37,250 --> 03:03:39,070
We lost two hot zones.

4518
03:03:39,730 --> 03:03:40,090
Audio.

4519
03:03:41,890 --> 03:03:44,730
That duo running at us in epicenter.

4520
03:03:45,830 --> 03:03:48,510
Yeah, that duo griefing us by landing in a draw spot.

4521
03:04:05,910 --> 03:04:06,610
Can't wait.

4522
03:04:06,610 --> 03:04:10,510
If I make it to end zone, I'm taking all my nades.

4523
03:04:10,570 --> 03:04:12,670
Give me all your nades and I'm throwing it in the center.

4524
03:04:13,510 --> 03:04:14,590
Wait, but we need nades too.

4525
03:04:14,830 --> 03:04:15,490
No, you guys don't.

4526
03:04:15,610 --> 03:04:17,450
You guys gotta heal off.

4527
03:04:20,860 --> 03:04:22,340
If I throw all the nades...

4528
03:04:22,340 --> 03:04:22,960
I'm the blue hunter.

4529
03:04:23,780 --> 03:04:27,000
If you throw the nades at the center, you're gonna get hurt.

4530
03:04:27,740 --> 03:04:29,180
By your own nades.

4531
03:04:29,700 --> 03:04:31,740
But if I throw it, you won't get hurt.

4532
03:04:32,500 --> 03:04:33,500
But you'll get hurt.

4533
03:04:33,860 --> 03:04:36,200
Yeah, that's why I'm sacrificing myself for the greater good.

4534
03:04:36,200 --> 03:04:37,500
I'll be a hero.

4535
03:04:38,640 --> 03:04:39,840
I wanna be a hero.

4536
03:04:40,460 --> 03:04:41,760
Alright, then you fucking do it.

4537
03:04:42,580 --> 03:04:42,980
Yippee!

4538
03:04:46,260 --> 03:04:49,060
I think at the end of the game, there's gonna be so many octane jump pads.

4539
03:04:49,340 --> 03:04:50,480
Oh yeah, 100%.

4540
03:04:50,480 --> 03:04:53,380
Everybody's just gonna put a jump pad surrounding.

4541
03:04:54,660 --> 03:04:56,780
Alright, how much do we bet there's a restart?

4542
03:04:58,560 --> 03:04:59,860
It's always a restart.

4543
03:05:00,920 --> 03:05:05,860
You guys are gonna have to stay alive on those octane jump pads, tap strafing, because I can't tap strafe off those.

4544
03:05:05,860 --> 03:05:07,100
I can tap strafe.

4545
03:05:07,900 --> 03:05:09,060
It's gonna be up to you guys.

4546
03:05:10,540 --> 03:05:13,940
In the endgame, keep tap strafing off the jump pads over and over again.

4547
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:18,680
And then, when the zone closes all the way, just hop on somebody's zipline until the game ends.

4548
03:05:20,400 --> 03:05:22,260
And I might just end up being the one punching.

4549
03:05:24,420 --> 03:05:25,880
What if I can't do that?

4550
03:05:27,880 --> 03:05:28,860
What if I fail?

4551
03:05:29,740 --> 03:05:31,020
No, I can tap strafe.

4552
03:05:31,780 --> 03:05:35,280
I'm just saying, what if I can't do it continuously?

4553
03:05:36,480 --> 03:05:39,820
Well, if you can't kill yourself, you can just come down with me and start swinging.

4554
03:05:40,060 --> 03:05:42,240
Alright, sure, it's all you.

4555
03:05:43,220 --> 03:05:44,180
It's all you.

4556
03:05:45,260 --> 03:05:47,500
We do want to look for kills throughout the game.

4557
03:05:48,780 --> 03:05:51,740
Until we get to endgame, we're gonna try and just three-man run people down.

4558
03:05:51,900 --> 03:05:55,300
Wait, it is ALGS points.

4559
03:05:55,820 --> 03:05:56,940
For this one, it is.

4560
03:05:56,960 --> 03:05:58,180
Oh, for this one.

4561
03:05:58,980 --> 03:06:01,500
I thought the other ones too.

4562
03:06:01,500 --> 03:06:03,100
No, no, no, no.

4563
03:06:03,100 --> 03:06:04,160
No, no, no.

4564
03:06:04,160 --> 03:06:05,180
Only this one.

4565
03:06:13,620 --> 03:06:15,840
Come on, this is the last game.

4566
03:06:16,080 --> 03:06:17,400
We're one hour over time.

4567
03:06:18,560 --> 03:06:19,980
Who's munching right now?

4568
03:06:20,140 --> 03:06:22,540
Me, I'm munching on my caramel popcorn.

4569
03:06:23,120 --> 03:06:24,440
I didn't eat lunch yet.

4570
03:06:25,400 --> 03:06:26,940
And it's gonna be dinner soon.

4571
03:06:27,220 --> 03:06:28,240
You didn't eat?

4572
03:06:29,520 --> 03:06:29,960
No.

4573
03:06:30,220 --> 03:06:31,180
Wait, what did we claim?

4574
03:06:32,140 --> 03:06:34,500
What the hell is with girls and just never eating?

4575
03:06:36,380 --> 03:06:37,760
Women, am I right?

4576
03:06:38,080 --> 03:06:39,560
Okay, I wasn't going that route.

4577
03:06:44,060 --> 03:06:44,940
I'm woman.

4578
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:56,900
Cause I woke up, I had to do I had one hour left to do work stuff and then work and walk my dog and then I had to go straight to this tournament.

4579
03:06:59,060 --> 03:07:00,620
As I can say, I'm woman.

4580
03:07:01,380 --> 03:07:02,680
I don't eat sometimes.

4581
03:07:03,900 --> 03:07:04,740
No, that's not true.

4582
03:07:04,800 --> 03:07:07,000
I do eat but I fuck up my eating schedule a lot.

4583
03:07:10,010 --> 03:07:10,790
I never.

4584
03:07:11,590 --> 03:07:12,230
You never eat?

4585
03:07:12,370 --> 03:07:13,330
I eat at the same times every day.

4586
03:07:13,890 --> 03:07:14,270
Really?

4587
03:07:14,590 --> 03:07:15,170
You have a schedule?

4588
03:07:15,210 --> 03:07:17,650
I wake up at 8pm and then after stream.

4589
03:07:21,020 --> 03:07:23,000
What happens if you don't follow your schedule?

4590
03:07:23,140 --> 03:07:23,940
Do you just combust?

4591
03:07:24,580 --> 03:07:25,580
I literally die.

4592
03:07:30,020 --> 03:07:31,940
Guys, remember you're like a Tamagotchi.

4593
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:35,680
If someone forgets to feed me, I start dying.

4594
03:07:35,700 --> 03:07:37,100
He just disappears.

4595
03:07:46,270 --> 03:07:47,710
Wait, what if we all go Ceto?

4596
03:07:48,010 --> 03:07:49,270
Yeah, what if we all do that?

4597
03:07:49,350 --> 03:07:49,950
You're right.

4598
03:07:50,190 --> 03:07:51,990
What if we all do that?

4599
03:07:54,810 --> 03:07:59,070
Just pick the Mac with the fucking boxing ring and send everyone in.

4600
03:07:59,110 --> 03:08:00,410
Apparently, it's removed.

4601
03:08:01,590 --> 03:08:02,030
What?

4602
03:08:02,030 --> 03:08:05,010
Yeah, I removed it because it's not in rotation.

4603
03:08:05,390 --> 03:08:06,950
This is fucked up.

4604
03:08:07,210 --> 03:08:09,070
This is such a fucked up day.

4605
03:08:11,750 --> 03:08:14,050
You almost got out of this custom.

4606
03:08:16,010 --> 03:08:17,090
Who, me?

4607
03:08:17,130 --> 03:08:18,050
You, yeah.

4608
03:08:18,510 --> 03:08:20,150
You weren't even supposed to be here.

4609
03:08:20,970 --> 03:08:24,070
Listen, that's life, isn't it?

4610
03:08:34,580 --> 03:08:37,100
Well, we got like money out of it at least.

4611
03:08:38,560 --> 03:08:39,800
How much did we even get?

4612
03:08:39,940 --> 03:08:40,400
I don't know.

4613
03:08:40,560 --> 03:08:42,980
Did he even tell us how the prize money is divided?

4614
03:08:43,620 --> 03:08:46,380
Yeah, but obviously, first place gets more of the money.

4615
03:08:46,760 --> 03:08:48,200
We should probably get like $50.

4616
03:08:48,560 --> 03:08:49,360
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

4617
03:08:49,500 --> 03:08:51,220
Did we just get $50 or some shit?

4618
03:08:52,620 --> 03:08:53,420
Maybe $25.

4619
03:08:55,120 --> 03:08:55,920
$50 each?

4620
03:08:56,160 --> 03:08:57,560
Oh my god, we're eating tonight.

4621
03:09:01,630 --> 03:09:04,070
Just gonna order a bunch of McDonald's.

4622
03:09:06,510 --> 03:09:08,870
And then I'm gonna fucking use the bathroom.

4623
03:09:09,030 --> 03:09:09,570
I'll be right back.

4624
03:09:09,650 --> 03:09:10,630
I don't know when we're starting.

4625
03:09:11,770 --> 03:09:12,170
Right now?

4626
03:09:12,690 --> 03:09:13,590
No way.

4627
03:09:14,230 --> 03:09:15,830
I lied by the way.

4628
03:09:16,190 --> 03:09:17,910
Because I didn't have my character picked.

4629
03:09:18,390 --> 03:09:20,070
So I'd be the reason why we restart.

4630
03:09:20,990 --> 03:09:21,630
That'd be lit.

4631
03:09:21,990 --> 03:09:23,670
Okay, I'm gonna attempt fate.

4632
03:09:27,240 --> 03:09:28,500
We're gonna have to restart.

4633
03:09:36,030 --> 03:09:37,310
It's actually starting.

4634
03:09:41,310 --> 03:09:42,190
Oh god.

4635
03:09:43,310 --> 03:09:44,770
Doki's gonna pick the wrong character.

4636
03:09:45,630 --> 03:09:46,630
It's all over.

4637
03:09:59,990 --> 03:10:01,730
Better hurry your ass up.

4638
03:10:08,930 --> 03:10:11,630
Okay, I'm on oof hunter.

4639
03:10:12,010 --> 03:10:13,510
Where the fuck is... there he is.

4640
03:10:14,910 --> 03:10:16,290
Well, she's picking last.

4641
03:10:16,430 --> 03:10:18,130
So she has a chance.

4642
03:10:18,450 --> 03:10:19,290
She has a chance.

4643
03:10:19,810 --> 03:10:21,670
Oh, I see her moving her mouse.

4644
03:10:24,110 --> 03:10:24,950
Let's go.

4645
03:10:25,730 --> 03:10:27,390
Back, thank fucking god.

4646
03:10:27,850 --> 03:10:29,690
You're lucky you were picking last.

4647
03:10:30,990 --> 03:10:33,090
I mean, we're gonna have to restart anyways.

4648
03:10:33,550 --> 03:10:34,990
Wait, no, you're right.

4649
03:10:35,430 --> 03:10:37,210
You're right, we're gonna have to restart anyway.

4650
03:10:37,450 --> 03:10:38,710
What was the point?

4651
03:10:42,180 --> 03:10:43,720
What fucking map are we on?

4652
03:10:47,160 --> 03:10:47,940
There's cars.

4653
03:10:48,360 --> 03:10:49,760
Wait, they didn't say no cars!

4654
03:10:50,040 --> 03:10:51,300
They said no cars.

4655
03:10:51,460 --> 03:10:53,400
They said no cars.

4656
03:10:54,740 --> 03:10:56,240
Yeah, they said no cars.

4657
03:10:58,360 --> 03:10:59,300
There it is.

4658
03:10:59,300 --> 03:11:01,400
There it is.

4659
03:11:02,700 --> 03:11:02,900
Alright.

4660
03:11:04,860 --> 03:11:06,320
Who dc'd?

4661
03:11:07,220 --> 03:11:09,520
Why is it every match?

4662
03:11:11,120 --> 03:11:12,240
VTubers, am I right?

4663
03:11:13,700 --> 03:11:14,600
What was the point?

4664
03:11:14,640 --> 03:11:15,300
I rushed.

4665
03:11:16,860 --> 03:11:18,640
We should blacklist all of them.

4666
03:11:19,420 --> 03:11:21,240
If you dc'd, you're never invited back.

4667
03:11:21,240 --> 03:11:23,240
The technology just isn't there.

4668
03:11:25,960 --> 03:11:28,780
20 more years of AI development.

4669
03:11:29,120 --> 03:11:29,820
Still hard.

4670
03:11:31,040 --> 03:11:33,420
Team Hakeem again?!

4671
03:11:35,940 --> 03:11:38,460
They did it again?!

4672
03:11:38,460 --> 03:11:42,440
Who was it?

4673
03:11:42,500 --> 03:11:44,000
It was.

4674
03:11:44,240 --> 03:11:45,420
Was it actually?

4675
03:11:46,080 --> 03:11:48,140
Oh my god, you're right, it is.

4676
03:11:48,140 --> 03:11:49,080
Are they a VTuber?

4677
03:11:49,820 --> 03:11:50,400
Who are they?

4678
03:11:51,300 --> 03:11:52,520
Alright, I'm finding them.

4679
03:11:54,020 --> 03:11:55,920
Yeah, get the detection work going in.

4680
03:11:56,140 --> 03:11:56,780
No, they're not!

4681
03:11:56,860 --> 03:11:58,520
They are the content creator category!

4682
03:11:59,860 --> 03:12:01,880
They're part of your category!

4683
03:12:05,240 --> 03:12:06,500
They're your people.

4684
03:12:06,800 --> 03:12:07,800
Control your people.

4685
03:12:09,920 --> 03:12:12,520
Control your fleshy fleshmen.

4686
03:12:13,820 --> 03:12:15,280
Oh, Fun also fucking trolled.

4687
03:12:15,280 --> 03:12:16,960
It was Fun that picked the catalyst.

4688
03:12:18,140 --> 03:12:18,540
Oh, really?

4689
03:12:18,820 --> 03:12:19,140
Yeah.

4690
03:12:23,500 --> 03:12:24,540
Fleshies, am I right?

4691
03:12:24,640 --> 03:12:25,660
Fucking pro players.

4692
03:12:26,420 --> 03:12:27,700
Always ruining everything.

4693
03:12:28,260 --> 03:12:28,920
Sleeping at the wheel.

4694
03:12:31,140 --> 03:12:32,900
I can't believe it.

4695
03:12:33,160 --> 03:12:37,400
I used the bathroom so fucking fast and there was no reason to.

4696
03:12:37,520 --> 03:12:40,980
I could have just let the world take me.

4697
03:12:45,990 --> 03:12:46,350
I

4698
03:12:54,990 --> 03:12:59,530
think if you keep taking a zipline over and over again you'll just never die to grenades.

4699
03:13:00,270 --> 03:13:01,550
Yeah, but you can only take it twice.

4700
03:13:02,730 --> 03:13:04,630
Oh, you're dead.

4701
03:13:14,470 --> 03:13:15,170
Restart again?

4702
03:13:20,450 --> 03:13:21,450
Oh, we're starting!

4703
03:13:22,230 --> 03:13:22,590
Restarting!

4704
03:13:23,490 --> 03:13:25,630
He's gonna get all the kills to everyone that has his own.

4705
03:13:29,500 --> 03:13:31,160
There's gonna be heat shields too, I think, by the way.

4706
03:13:31,160 --> 03:13:32,660
Oh yeah, we get heat shields!

4707
03:13:33,660 --> 03:13:38,380
If we actually end up using all six of our heat shields we'll just win the game for free.

4708
03:13:39,280 --> 03:13:40,620
We each get to carry two.

4709
03:13:41,300 --> 03:13:41,660
Wait, really?

4710
03:13:45,220 --> 03:13:46,460
I'm last pick again.

4711
03:13:47,340 --> 03:13:49,820
So if we find three heat shields, we're looking real good.

4712
03:13:49,980 --> 03:13:50,260
Yay!

4713
03:13:53,340 --> 03:13:54,120
I'm ready.

4714
03:13:54,560 --> 03:13:55,520
What are my skills?

4715
03:13:55,820 --> 03:13:59,040
I want an extra launch pad charge.

4716
03:14:00,940 --> 03:14:03,300
Change directions with the launch pad double charge.

4717
03:14:06,060 --> 03:14:09,080
You guys pick what you want for those characters.

4718
03:14:09,580 --> 03:14:10,880
That's not my expertise.

4719
03:14:12,820 --> 03:14:15,040
Alright, Ice King is right here.

4720
03:14:16,680 --> 03:14:19,200
Nobody goes Devastate Coast, we can split loot all of it too.

4721
03:14:19,700 --> 03:14:20,380
That's true.

4722
03:14:22,080 --> 03:14:23,160
What if I just go there?

4723
03:14:23,380 --> 03:14:26,320
What if I land on somebody and knock them out and then you craft me?

4724
03:14:29,120 --> 03:14:30,080
That's crazy.

4725
03:14:30,180 --> 03:14:32,040
Do we have crafters?

4726
03:14:32,040 --> 03:14:32,960
Wait, do we have crafters?

4727
03:14:32,960 --> 03:14:33,600
We don't have crafters.

4728
03:14:34,140 --> 03:14:36,320
Hey, you almost freaking griefed.

4729
03:14:40,840 --> 03:14:46,020
I just wanted to fucking beat someone up.

4730
03:14:46,360 --> 03:14:48,160
One of you can land on each dock and I'll loot the...

4731
03:14:48,160 --> 03:14:49,480
I'll loot this one.

4732
03:14:50,320 --> 03:14:51,160
I'll loot over here.

4733
03:14:51,520 --> 03:14:53,860
Yeah, there's people landed there.

4734
03:14:53,860 --> 03:14:58,520
I could've landed on these guys and you guys could've crafted me if I had a crafter.

4735
03:15:06,020 --> 03:15:06,580
Guys,

4736
03:15:12,140 --> 03:15:13,500
I don't even find any grenades.

4737
03:15:13,660 --> 03:15:14,200
Me too.

4738
03:15:16,920 --> 03:15:17,860
Butterfly knife.

4739
03:15:18,220 --> 03:15:19,000
That's cool.

4740
03:15:21,100 --> 03:15:24,000
Can I put a fucking scope on my grenade?

4741
03:15:26,140 --> 03:15:27,420
Like a drone?

4742
03:15:29,480 --> 03:15:31,460
Fucking drone somebody.

4743
03:15:32,080 --> 03:15:32,380
Yeah.

4744
03:15:36,180 --> 03:15:37,880
I haven't found a single grenade.

4745
03:15:38,420 --> 03:15:39,480
I have like... I have four.

4746
03:15:41,120 --> 03:15:44,640
I have a lot of nades.

4747
03:15:44,720 --> 03:15:45,640
Do you want some of my nades?

4748
03:15:46,440 --> 03:15:46,860
Yeah.

4749
03:15:50,400 --> 03:15:51,580
Holy shit.

4750
03:15:52,340 --> 03:15:52,680
Yeah,

4751
03:15:56,500 --> 03:15:57,760
I'll give you some nades.

4752
03:16:00,800 --> 03:16:02,080
There's no nades up here.

4753
03:16:02,160 --> 03:16:02,820
I wanna die.

4754
03:16:03,780 --> 03:16:04,280
Bro, here.

4755
03:16:05,580 --> 03:16:06,980
I threw you some nades.

4756
03:16:07,300 --> 03:16:08,960
So it'd be less sad for you.

4757
03:16:09,760 --> 03:16:10,280
I scanned.

4758
03:16:10,980 --> 03:16:12,220
There's like people here.

4759
03:16:13,200 --> 03:16:14,760
I think that's where people are fighting.

4760
03:16:18,320 --> 03:16:19,680
Did you pick up my nades?

4761
03:16:20,260 --> 03:16:20,720
Yeah.

4762
03:16:21,540 --> 03:16:22,000
Alright.

4763
03:16:22,560 --> 03:16:23,200
Good job.

4764
03:16:28,690 --> 03:16:31,050
What if like I just hold a gun but not use it?

4765
03:16:31,950 --> 03:16:32,810
That'd be weird.

4766
03:16:32,810 --> 03:16:34,550
It's just to freak people out.

4767
03:16:34,750 --> 03:16:36,350
It shows you don't have self-restraint.

4768
03:16:36,930 --> 03:16:37,410
I do.

4769
03:16:37,650 --> 03:16:41,770
I have a bigger self-restraint by not shooting my gun that I'm holding.

4770
03:16:42,690 --> 03:16:43,050
Nah.

4771
03:16:43,210 --> 03:16:44,330
Cause you still picked it up.

4772
03:16:47,370 --> 03:16:48,490
Where do we go?

4773
03:16:49,370 --> 03:16:50,090
I've been...

4774
03:16:50,090 --> 03:16:50,910
Loot all the bones up here.

4775
03:16:50,950 --> 03:16:51,310
Just keep looting.

4776
03:16:52,210 --> 03:16:53,390
I'm gonna ask you guys for some shields.

4777
03:16:53,550 --> 03:16:54,670
I didn't really get to loot too much over here.

4778
03:16:56,750 --> 03:16:57,790
Oh, I have more nades.

4779
03:16:59,290 --> 03:17:00,410
Pick up lots of shields.

4780
03:17:00,510 --> 03:17:01,050
I only have one battery.

4781
03:17:01,050 --> 03:17:01,890
Alright.

4782
03:17:02,430 --> 03:17:03,410
I have a lot.

4783
03:17:03,570 --> 03:17:05,650
I have three phoenix kits if anyone wants any.

4784
03:17:06,490 --> 03:17:07,590
I don't have a backpack either.

4785
03:17:07,670 --> 03:17:08,470
Pick a backpack for me.

4786
03:17:09,130 --> 03:17:10,210
Here's a blue one.

4787
03:17:11,770 --> 03:17:12,710
Oh, I got dibbed.

4788
03:17:12,970 --> 03:17:13,170
You carry backpacks?

4789
03:17:14,150 --> 03:17:15,590
No, I was just gonna pick one for me.

4790
03:17:16,190 --> 03:17:17,290
Oh, I grabbed it.

4791
03:17:23,630 --> 03:17:24,690
I'm gonna look for this evo up here.

4792
03:17:24,910 --> 03:17:26,330
There's more shields here.

4793
03:17:27,070 --> 03:17:28,550
Someone just scanned up there.

4794
03:17:29,010 --> 03:17:31,610
Take my nade here cause I'm getting meds.

4795
03:17:33,410 --> 03:17:35,090
Someone's gonna die on me.

4796
03:17:37,410 --> 03:17:38,430
We're getting naded.

4797
03:17:38,870 --> 03:17:39,930
I'm heading up.

4798
03:17:41,890 --> 03:17:43,290
I'm getting ran at.

4799
03:17:43,870 --> 03:17:44,150
Really?

4800
03:17:44,150 --> 03:17:45,330
I have a jump pad.

4801
03:17:45,570 --> 03:17:46,130
Is there?

4802
03:17:47,450 --> 03:17:48,470
I'm here with you.

4803
03:17:48,530 --> 03:17:49,390
Oh, there he is.

4804
03:17:51,230 --> 03:17:52,250
I'm getting ran at.

4805
03:17:52,330 --> 03:17:53,050
Come, come, come, help me.

4806
03:17:53,070 --> 03:17:54,570
Yeah, I'm here, I'm here.

4807
03:17:55,790 --> 03:17:57,510
Wait, we can take them all to you.

4808
03:17:57,510 --> 03:17:58,470
Kill this guy.

4809
03:18:00,050 --> 03:18:00,270
I'm here.

4810
03:18:01,030 --> 03:18:01,550
Oh.

4811
03:18:03,110 --> 03:18:04,130
There you go.

4812
03:18:05,130 --> 03:18:06,350
I cracked him.

4813
03:18:06,950 --> 03:18:07,730
He's out.

4814
03:18:09,410 --> 03:18:10,770
Oh, come here, come here, come here.

4815
03:18:11,790 --> 03:18:13,210
Oh, I think we gotta craft you.

4816
03:18:13,310 --> 03:18:14,610
I'm leaving so we can craft you.

4817
03:18:16,070 --> 03:18:17,790
Why did you not help me?

4818
03:18:18,050 --> 03:18:19,710
There's literally, we're at two teams.

4819
03:18:21,470 --> 03:18:24,030
Why am I sacrificed to the wolves?

4820
03:18:25,990 --> 03:18:26,910
Let's go craft.

4821
03:18:27,010 --> 03:18:28,030
Let's find a crafter.

4822
03:18:28,290 --> 03:18:31,310
I can't outrun a fucking octane, man.

4823
03:18:35,130 --> 03:18:38,430
Yeah, he's just fucking chasing.

4824
03:18:39,890 --> 03:18:41,190
Doki, you gotta help.

4825
03:18:41,330 --> 03:18:41,850
Wait, what?

4826
03:18:42,910 --> 03:18:44,030
He's still chasing.

4827
03:18:45,270 --> 03:18:46,050
He's weak, Doki.

4828
03:18:46,130 --> 03:18:46,930
Kill him, kill this guy.

4829
03:18:47,230 --> 03:18:48,990
No, I can't because his teammates are here.

4830
03:18:49,370 --> 03:18:51,770
Yeah, I'm fucking mighty dead then.

4831
03:18:54,070 --> 03:18:56,070
You guys didn't tell me he was chasing.

4832
03:18:57,930 --> 03:19:00,230
I literally was not paying attention.

4833
03:19:01,310 --> 03:19:01,850
Uh-oh.

4834
03:19:02,550 --> 03:19:03,350
Oh, this is bad.

4835
03:19:05,230 --> 03:19:07,070
The closest crafter is really far.

4836
03:19:08,030 --> 03:19:08,870
Godspeed, soldier.

4837
03:19:13,150 --> 03:19:14,110
It's a crafter command center.

4838
03:19:15,750 --> 03:19:16,910
Yeah, but they might chase.

4839
03:19:18,050 --> 03:19:19,990
Oh, they're 100% gonna chase.

4840
03:19:20,830 --> 03:19:22,170
How many white meds do you have?

4841
03:19:22,430 --> 03:19:26,630
I have four syringes and five shield cells.

4842
03:19:29,980 --> 03:19:31,460
I mean, I could do here.

4843
03:19:33,620 --> 03:19:35,740
I would just go hit the crafter.

4844
03:19:40,570 --> 03:19:46,250
You could maybe call us in in the zone on top command center.

4845
03:19:47,090 --> 03:19:47,370
Yeah.

4846
03:19:51,340 --> 03:19:52,920
What if I die in the zone?

4847
03:19:53,100 --> 03:19:54,180
That would be so awkward.

4848
03:19:54,860 --> 03:19:56,360
That would be so Akko-Takko.

4849
03:19:57,160 --> 03:19:58,760
That would be pretty funny, though.

4850
03:20:00,380 --> 03:20:01,320
I hear people.

4851
03:20:01,520 --> 03:20:01,840
Yep.

4852
03:20:04,400 --> 03:20:05,380
I might be dead.

4853
03:20:06,200 --> 03:20:08,080
Nah, they're not gonna chase, bro.

4854
03:20:10,300 --> 03:20:11,760
I could try cascades.

4855
03:20:12,320 --> 03:20:13,240
Yeah, just go look for it.

4856
03:20:14,280 --> 03:20:16,400
I don't want a full syringe.

4857
03:20:16,480 --> 03:20:18,840
I feel like that's so risky.

4858
03:20:19,500 --> 03:20:20,920
If I run into a team.

4859
03:20:23,180 --> 03:20:24,060
What are they gonna do?

4860
03:20:24,180 --> 03:20:24,640
Punch you?

4861
03:20:25,480 --> 03:20:28,680
All three of them can punch me and I just...

4862
03:20:28,680 --> 03:20:28,840
Nope.

4863
03:20:37,260 --> 03:20:39,020
And there's a team in front of you.

4864
03:20:39,500 --> 03:20:41,100
That's what I'm thinking about.

4865
03:20:41,440 --> 03:20:43,120
Why did you guys have to die?

4866
03:20:44,040 --> 03:20:45,340
You didn't help me!

4867
03:20:45,520 --> 03:20:46,200
Or him!

4868
03:20:46,680 --> 03:20:46,680
I did!

4869
03:20:50,180 --> 03:20:51,620
I did!

4870
03:20:51,880 --> 03:20:56,360
I had to help Verhulst and then I had to turn around I had to help you!

4871
03:20:56,380 --> 03:20:58,560
I was left to the fucking wolves!

4872
03:20:59,500 --> 03:21:01,520
Like, what do you expect me to do?

4873
03:21:03,880 --> 03:21:05,900
I had to turn around twice!

4874
03:21:08,020 --> 03:21:08,980
I'm fucking dead.

4875
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:10,240
I'm gonna go straight back to command center.

4876
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:12,720
Oh my god, they're running after me.

4877
03:21:13,420 --> 03:21:13,820
I can't.

4878
03:21:13,880 --> 03:21:14,860
They're literally running after me.

4879
03:21:15,080 --> 03:21:16,740
My death is on your shoulders.

4880
03:21:17,000 --> 03:21:17,540
I'm a ghost.

4881
03:21:17,940 --> 03:21:18,940
Back to cascades then.

4882
03:21:20,020 --> 03:21:21,880
Like, they're literally right behind me.

4883
03:21:22,220 --> 03:21:24,000
The only other crafter in zone 2 is pylon.

4884
03:21:24,000 --> 03:21:25,900
That'll be your only other option once zone closes.

4885
03:21:29,240 --> 03:21:31,280
Like, I can't!

4886
03:21:31,680 --> 03:21:33,140
Wait, did he shoot you?

4887
03:21:33,380 --> 03:21:34,460
No, he punched me.

4888
03:21:35,100 --> 03:21:36,580
How the fuck is he behind you?

4889
03:21:36,780 --> 03:21:38,140
Because he slid!

4890
03:21:39,280 --> 03:21:41,120
But you were sliding.

4891
03:21:43,520 --> 03:21:44,540
He's a pathfinder!

4892
03:21:45,900 --> 03:21:46,960
Eh, you'll be fine.

4893
03:21:50,020 --> 03:21:51,540
Oh my god!

4894
03:21:51,540 --> 03:21:53,720
I hate this!

4895
03:22:00,200 --> 03:22:01,540
If they hit just one arcstar...

4896
03:22:02,840 --> 03:22:03,760
That's all they needed.

4897
03:22:04,400 --> 03:22:06,060
Oh no, Docting's coming over too.

4898
03:22:06,440 --> 03:22:08,040
The Octane's coming over as well.

4899
03:22:08,520 --> 03:22:09,480
Oh, he's juicing.

4900
03:22:09,820 --> 03:22:11,180
Yo, take the fucking thing!

4901
03:22:11,260 --> 03:22:12,340
I'm gonna take it!

4902
03:22:12,580 --> 03:22:14,960
You can take it and throw it at your feet.

4903
03:22:15,020 --> 03:22:16,380
If you've any nades, throw them at your feet and they chase you.

4904
03:22:18,660 --> 03:22:20,820
Throw them on the bottom of the platform Yeah, right here.

4905
03:22:26,200 --> 03:22:26,940
Bro.

4906
03:22:27,840 --> 03:22:29,020
They want you.

4907
03:22:29,280 --> 03:22:30,600
They really want me.

4908
03:22:35,400 --> 03:22:37,180
One more hit!

4909
03:22:37,460 --> 03:22:38,000
One more!

4910
03:22:38,460 --> 03:22:41,060
I told you!

4911
03:22:43,040 --> 03:22:44,640
Docting, you're supposed to clutch off!

4912
03:22:44,960 --> 03:22:47,000
What do you mean?!

4913
03:22:47,000 --> 03:22:49,720
I fucked up my tap stream!

4914
03:22:49,720 --> 03:22:51,040
This dude has fucking...

4915
03:22:51,500 --> 03:22:52,140
Red armor!

4916
03:22:52,820 --> 03:22:55,500
They actually got evo shield!

4917
03:22:56,320 --> 03:22:56,960
I panicked.

4918
03:22:57,060 --> 03:22:58,340
I messed up my tap stream.

4919
03:22:58,600 --> 03:23:00,020
Bro, I was left at a 1v3.

4920
03:23:00,440 --> 03:23:04,080
I had to save for host and then I had to turn around for you!

4921
03:23:04,220 --> 03:23:04,580
Don't fucking care!

4922
03:23:04,580 --> 03:23:05,640
You didn't even save him.

4923
03:23:05,700 --> 03:23:07,100
You watched him fucking die.

4924
03:23:07,400 --> 03:23:10,420
I saved him and I didn't realize they were still chasing him!

4925
03:23:14,500 --> 03:23:15,700
All I'm saying is...

4926
03:23:15,700 --> 03:23:17,920
It was definitely not my fault.

4927
03:23:17,920 --> 03:23:19,620
It was not my fault.

4928
03:23:19,620 --> 03:23:21,240
It seems you've come for you again.

4929
03:23:21,300 --> 03:23:23,180
Somebody else died first.

4930
03:23:26,300 --> 03:23:27,520
I had zero craft.

4931
03:23:27,680 --> 03:23:29,920
I could go to zero crafters.

4932
03:23:35,080 --> 03:23:35,680
Happens.

4933
03:23:38,460 --> 03:23:39,360
GG's guys.

4934
03:23:41,500 --> 03:23:42,100
GG's!

4935
03:23:42,620 --> 03:23:43,620
I am gonna...

4936
03:23:44,240 --> 03:23:45,560
I'm gonna call it here.

4937
03:23:45,560 --> 03:23:46,840
I have my other stream.

4938
03:23:47,480 --> 03:23:49,060
Are you gonna play Path of Exile?

4939
03:23:49,840 --> 03:23:50,420
Probably.

4940
03:23:51,380 --> 03:23:52,640
What about you bro host?

4941
03:23:52,740 --> 03:23:54,040
What's your day gonna be like?

4942
03:23:55,020 --> 03:23:56,200
I will be eating some dinner.

4943
03:23:56,920 --> 03:23:58,080
What are you gonna eat?

4944
03:23:58,340 --> 03:24:00,900
I got some...

4945
03:24:01,560 --> 03:24:02,680
Papa cooked salmon.

4946
03:24:03,360 --> 03:24:03,940
Wow!

4947
03:24:04,860 --> 03:24:06,020
Sounds good.

4948
03:24:07,320 --> 03:24:07,900
Yummy.

4949
03:24:08,600 --> 03:24:11,200
I need to order my one meal today.

4950
03:24:12,380 --> 03:24:13,980
Alright, GG's guys.

4951
03:24:13,980 --> 03:24:14,480
GG's.

4952
03:24:14,480 --> 03:24:17,060
I don't really care who wins this game.

4953
03:24:19,440 --> 03:24:20,560
GG's everybody.

4954
03:24:21,600 --> 03:24:22,240
GG's.

4955
03:24:22,520 --> 03:24:23,480
Bye bye.

4956
03:24:25,720 --> 03:24:26,940
Oh my god.

4957
03:24:27,240 --> 03:24:30,820
That wasn't my fault.

4958
03:24:31,120 --> 03:24:32,460
That we lost there.

4959
03:24:32,560 --> 03:24:33,800
The last game.

4960
03:24:34,460 --> 03:24:36,720
Even if I saved for wholesome time.

4961
03:24:37,040 --> 03:24:38,920
We would have died anyway.

4962
03:24:39,080 --> 03:24:42,200
Because we had a full team chasing us.

4963
03:24:46,340 --> 03:24:48,420
We would have died anyway.

4964
03:24:51,440 --> 03:24:55,500
I literally made the best of the situation.

4965
03:24:59,860 --> 03:25:02,200
To be fair, I literally didn't hear him say help.

4966
03:25:02,320 --> 03:25:03,060
I just heard...

4967
03:25:03,060 --> 03:25:06,000
I heard Surefour said help, but I was just like it's over Surefour.

4968
03:25:06,040 --> 03:25:06,900
We're fucking leaving.

4969
03:25:07,240 --> 03:25:07,980
There's no way.

4970
03:25:08,040 --> 03:25:09,240
There's two teams on us.

4971
03:25:09,280 --> 03:25:11,780
There's no fucking way we can do anything.

4972
03:25:17,080 --> 03:25:17,760
Anyway.

4973
03:25:17,920 --> 03:25:20,040
No, this event was so cursed.

4974
03:25:20,220 --> 03:25:21,540
Because everything...

4975
03:25:21,540 --> 03:25:23,860
We lost our two hot drops.

4976
03:25:24,380 --> 03:25:25,540
I dc'd.

4977
03:25:25,920 --> 03:25:27,740
In the middle of it.

4978
03:25:28,720 --> 03:25:30,500
And then what else happened?

4979
03:25:30,640 --> 03:25:31,800
So many shit happened.

4980
03:25:33,380 --> 03:25:35,480
Yeah, they chased me for half...

4981
03:25:35,480 --> 03:25:38,180
They chased me for so fucking long.

4982
03:25:38,720 --> 03:25:39,780
They did.

4983
03:25:40,300 --> 03:25:42,080
There was four other teams.

4984
03:25:42,080 --> 03:25:43,980
There were...

4985
03:25:43,980 --> 03:25:47,860
I literally ran into four different teams.

4986
03:25:48,340 --> 03:25:51,860
And this one team chased me through all of them.

4987
03:25:57,480 --> 03:26:00,940
Yeah, anyway guys.

4988
03:26:01,080 --> 03:26:03,280
I have another stream in 30 minutes.

4989
03:26:03,400 --> 03:26:04,520
So I'm gonna...

4990
03:26:04,520 --> 03:26:07,120
I'm gonna go prep for that stream.

4991
03:26:07,380 --> 03:26:08,820
I will see you guys...

4992
03:26:08,820 --> 03:26:09,740
I'm gonna break the other stream.

4993
03:26:09,740 --> 03:26:11,020
I'll see you guys there everybody.

4994
03:26:11,160 --> 03:26:11,980
GG's everyone.

4995
03:26:12,320 --> 03:26:14,500
Thanks for playing with me.

4996
03:26:14,960 --> 03:26:15,820
Well, it was randomized.

4997
03:26:16,100 --> 03:26:18,480
That was not randomized.

4998
03:26:20,540 --> 03:26:22,380
He requested to be on my team.

4999
03:26:23,620 --> 03:26:23,880
But yeah.

5000
03:26:24,020 --> 03:26:24,640
GG's everyone.

5001
03:26:24,720 --> 03:26:25,980
Stay hydrated.

5002
03:26:26,120 --> 03:26:28,700
And you stay up for me.

5003
03:26:29,060 --> 03:26:30,160
Stay up for a little longer.

5004
03:26:30,360 --> 03:26:32,720
Because we have a second stream later.

5005
03:26:32,900 --> 03:26:33,640
Bye bye guys.

5006
03:26:33,720 --> 03:26:34,120
Bye.
