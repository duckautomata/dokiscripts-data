1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
What happened to the other parts?

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,160
What happened to the other parts of the discussion?

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,120
They just left it out.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:06,660
Do you know what I mean?

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,100
Oh, fake news.

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,080
Oh, fake news.

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:09,900
At it again.

8
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,660
It's all fake news.

9
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,400
It's all fake news.

10
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh, so you're trying to say you're blaming women for this then.

11
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:18,960
Exactly.

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,200
Oh, so you're blaming Pokimane for this.

13
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,220
So I'm blaming women.

14
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,420
So you're blaming women for all of the things wrong in your life.

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,600
Exactly.

16
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,140
Yeah, that sounds like him.

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,520
Yeah, that does sound like him.

18
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,680
Pokimane was right.

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,180
No, no, no, no.

20
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,440
Surely not.

21
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:38,940
Surely.

22
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:46,340
Dude, the worst thing is that the moment Psyche did the thing about the policy thing, I go on Twitter and there's a...

23
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:51,680
Phawsh was playing this horror game and there's this guy who's saying, Oh, why is there a woman working behind this bar?

24
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,300
And they're at the same time saying, Why does Elim have a character in this game?

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,460
And I messaged them both to Poki.

26
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,060
He was like, you've won the war.

27
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,820
I'm like, brother, there's no way.

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,540
Wait, how do we play this game, guys?

29
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,280
You have everybody, right?

30
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,740
I need an invite.

31
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,640
Yeah, I think I need probably everybody.

32
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,320
I'm in the game now.

33
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,220
Is there any settings I should adjust?

34
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,240
No.

35
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,660
Any projection is on.

36
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,920
Alright, gameplay.

37
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,200
Okay, I'm gonna get the mouse.

38
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,540
Alright, so I'm going in blind, but I heard good things about this game.

39
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,220
All I know is it involves a gun and dice.

40
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,740
So there's two games.

41
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,880
There's Liar's Deck, which is the deck game with the cards.

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,180
And there's Liar's Dice, which is the dice.

43
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,440
They're both very fun, so we should play both.

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,180
Okay, let's do it.

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,220
So one of you has to be the fox character as well.

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,380
What does that mean?

47
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,440
Elim should be it.

48
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,160
I think Elim, you like women, right?

49
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,060
You love women, right?

50
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,600
You should be the fox.

51
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,940
But specifically, why?

52
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,300
No, you'll understand.

53
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,520
For the culture.

54
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,380
Yeah, for the culture.

55
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,140
If it's gonna help women, that's what I'm willing to do.

56
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:01,660
And that's fine.

57
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,420
And I'm okay with that.

58
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,320
Yeah, so if you love women, you shouldn't question it.

59
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,200
If you love women, you shouldn't question it.

60
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,180
Yeah, because I never would.

61
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:11,740
I never would.

62
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,800
I can't seem to...

63
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,300
How do I add people?

64
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,020
Who the hell is...

65
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,220
Wait, why are there random people joining my lobby?

66
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,080
Get the fuck out of here, bro.

67
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,580
Did you make a puppet lobby?

68
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,500
Make it private.

69
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,940
Oh my god, everyone's joining.

70
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,560
Let me leave.

71
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,980
Jesus Christ, what the monka?

72
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,460
Once again, we're letting Elim host.

73
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,680
And this is what we get.

74
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,880
Chill, why don't you host?

75
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,100
You have the most experience.

76
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,760
He's got everybody on his friends list, right?

77
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,380
Do I have Doki on Steam?

78
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,720
Yes, you do.

79
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,580
I'm invisible right now, but I go online.

80
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,620
Oh, you both got to be invisible.

81
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,980
I'm online now.

82
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,140
Let me get you my...

83
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,360
I can just join his game here.

84
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,060
Oh, that's wonderful.

85
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,180
Okay, Rowan.

86
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,200
How do I change my character?

87
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,880
You just click on it.

88
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,660
Click, click, click.

89
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,080
Yeah, there.

90
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,660
Stop there.

91
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,140
Yeah, stop there.

92
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,700
You love women, right?

93
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,260
That's the only women character.

94
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,900
I'll be the pig.

95
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,180
You won't be the pig.

96
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,100
You won't be the pig.

97
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:18,820
You sticko.

98
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,400
I'll be the dog.

99
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,660
What's wrong with pigs, man?

100
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,320
They're friendly.

101
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,580
Pigs eat people.

102
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,940
Isn't that how you get rid of the body?

103
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,180
Not only bodies, they eat anything.

104
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,840
Yeah, so you can't get...

105
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,560
You can't get scratches on...

106
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,140
If a pig gets another scratch, one of the pigs will devour the other pig because of the smell of blood.

107
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,400
Wait, really?

108
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,760
Yeah, because they eat everything.

109
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,140
Yeah, yeah, you do.

110
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,180
Because they can smell the blood.

111
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,260
And then they'll just be like, oh, food!

112
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,440
Wait, oh, you sent me something?

113
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,740
Did you delete me from Steam?

114
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,360
No, I get it.

115
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,000
It's okay, you hate me.

116
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,240
It's fine.

117
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,100
I mean, after the allegations we just heard about, I won't be surprised.

118
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys.

119
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,620
They're not allegations.

120
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,440
They're so factual.

121
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,920
Oh, oh, oh.

122
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,580
That's good to know.

123
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,460
That's good to know.

124
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,420
Oh, goodness.

125
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,780
Oh, goodness.

126
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,260
Oh, wait, okay, so is there anything I need to change?

127
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:21,920
No.

128
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,540
No, so we just picked between Liar's Deck and Liar's Box.

129
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,420
Which is better, too?

130
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,600
Let's start with Liar's Dice because it's easier.

131
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,920
Liar's Dice, okay.

132
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,860
How do I start?

133
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,900
Second is the Ready Up.

134
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:34,960
Far right.

135
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,180
Top right, top right.

136
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

137
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,300
Oh, there we go.

138
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,020
Okay, we're in.

139
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm so used to the ready button being in the bottom middle or something.

140
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,700
Yeah, me too.

141
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,220
Okay.

142
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,600
Do you guys know how to play Liar's Dice?

143
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,860
No, I have no idea.

144
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,560
Okay, so I'll give you the quick rundown.

145
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,680
You're going to hit the spacebar to look at your dice.

146
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,560
Spacebar to look at your dice?

147
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,040
I got it.

148
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,380
Can I see your dice?

149
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:58,860
Can I cheat?

150
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,520
No, you can't cheat.

151
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,400
The stakes have to get upped every single time.

152
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,680
So, Ellen, you'll see right now that you get to bet how many dice you think are on the table.

153
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,560
That is everybody's dice.

154
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,800
So you can say there's going to be two ones on the table between all of us.

155
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,980
And then it goes to me, and I have to make a higher bet of the number of dice I think is in all of our cups.

156
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,060
So it's not just your cup, it's everybody's cup.

157
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,800
Wait, so are we just guessing then?

158
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,920
That's the lie part.

159
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,960
That's the lie part in this game.

160
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,660
Dude, I'm going to be lying all the time because I'm bad at guessing.

161
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,940
Then that means Ellen can call it.

162
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,560
Does that mean you can't see how many dice I have, basically?

163
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,520
Well, we know you have five, but we don't know what you have.

164
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,500
And Andy has to get up every single time.

165
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,080
So I choose the number, and I choose...

166
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,200
five ones.

167
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,000
So you think there's five ones among all of us.

168
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,560
Nah, that was a misclick, I'm going to be honest.

169
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,440
I think I misunderstood.

170
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,320
I thought I was setting it to five.

171
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,080
Okay.

172
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,280
Wait, so when do you call out a liar?

173
00:05:59,580 --> 00:05:59,940
Liar.

174
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,040
So she called out a liar.

175
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:04,800
Okay.

176
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,820
Dude, I wasn't lying, I just didn't guess right.

177
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,660
You're poisoned!

178
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,100
I wasn't lying, I just didn't guess right, bro.

179
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,580
How am I supposed to know?

180
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,680
Wait, what?

181
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,760
How am I supposed to know?

182
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,000
You're not!

183
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,200
That's the whole game!

184
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,080
Then how do I bet stuff?

185
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,740
Well, the idea is you're going to bet...

186
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,100
You want to hope it's reasonable.

187
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,420
You want to hope it's a reasonable bet, and then go to the next person.

188
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,440
Okay.

189
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:33,860
Alright.

190
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,540
So based on your dice, let's say you're sitting on two fives, right?

191
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,800
You may say, okay, well then I think there's probably four fives among us all.

192
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:42,680
You may say, okay, well then I think there's probably four fives among us all.

193
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,780
Wait, so am I doing a bet right now?

194
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,200
Uh, no.

195
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,060
So he thinks it's one-one?

196
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,080
Is that what that means?

197
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,600
Yeah, I mean, there's going to be at least one-one, yeah.

198
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,560
Oh, I didn't even know it was my turn.

199
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:55,740
Okay.

200
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,820
I'm learning, I'm learning.

201
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,300
I am right with you.

202
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,460
Wait, what do I have?

203
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,400
It's a process.

204
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,320
It's definitely a guesser's dice, someone in my chat was saying.

205
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,460
I'm going to get it soon.

206
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,620
I think there's four fives.

207
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,740
Yeah, I do.

208
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,120
I do.

209
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,720
Now you have to up the ante or call her a liar, Elim.

210
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,720
Yeah, Elim, you think I'm a fucking liar?

211
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,360
Do you know what I think?

212
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,180
Yeah.

213
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,260
You know what I think?

214
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,000
I think there's...

215
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,960
Four sixes.

216
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,840
I think you're a liar.

217
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,480
That's insane.

218
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,380
He's got none, you have two, I got none.

219
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,540
Wait, he has two.

220
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,160
Shit.

221
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,240
And I have two.

222
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,840
You got poison.

223
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,860
No, I don't want it.

224
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,520
Wait, how many sixes did you say?

225
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,680
Four.

226
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,940
That's insane.

227
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,680
Because I thought there was already two.

228
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,320
Oh.

229
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,820
We just happen to have none.

230
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,940
Yeah, we just happen to have none.

231
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,880
It's just prediction.

232
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,800
Look at that.

233
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,360
It's gotta be three fours, it's gotta be three fours.

234
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,020
He's lying.

235
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,380
No, no, no, I'm not a liar.

236
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,080
No, trust me, trust me, chill.

237
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,200
I'm not a liar, I'm just bad at this game.

238
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,560
That's true, that's true, that's true.

239
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,780
And call me out.

240
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,360
Oh, that's a liar.

241
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,580
Four fives?

242
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,100
Yeah, four fives.

243
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,100
That's a liar, that's a liar.

244
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,680
I think there's five fives.

245
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,640
You think there's five fives?

246
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,940
Dude, there's gotta be five fives.

247
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,260
There's just gotta be.

248
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,160
There's no shot, there's five.

249
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,140
He's crazed.

250
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,800
There's gotta be five fives.

251
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,000
Crazed.

252
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,520
Liar.

253
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,140
No shot.

254
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,500
No, there's not fives, right?

255
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,660
I have one.

256
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,680
I got three.

257
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,620
Oh, dude, and I got three.

258
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,740
Wait, what happens now?

259
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,360
Do I win?

260
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,360
She drinks up.

261
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,560
Poison.

262
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,020
How does he so many?

263
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,240
We gotta get chilled.

264
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,000
We gotta get chilled.

265
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,960
Oh, dude, I'm gone.

266
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,700
He's drinking up, it's fine.

267
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,580
Enjoy the beverage.

268
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,860
I'm playing safe.

269
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,020
I'm playing safe.

270
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,560
Oh, dude.

271
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,820
Oh, you know what's crazy?

272
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,640
I'll match your five fives.

273
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,060
And I'll go five fives.

274
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,880
What the fuck?

275
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,240
He's going so high.

276
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,460
He's just inting.

277
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,880
He's just inting.

278
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,880
Three of them, no way.

279
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,160
Oh, no.

280
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Five fives.

281
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,400
Yeah, we got him.

282
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,920
We fucking got him.

283
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,100
That's a wild claim immediately.

284
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,500
That's actually insanity that he just did that.

285
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,860
Oh my god.

286
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,500
We all got poisoned once.

287
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,100
We each have like one turn left.

288
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,220
I can't believe he just hit it with that.

289
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,940
Two ones, what do I have here?

290
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,160
Let's go, Ray.

291
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,640
The quotes from these guys get a little annoying.

292
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,420
But they're silly.

293
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,000
Call me a liar?

294
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,100
Oh, I'm calling you a liar.

295
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,380
I ain't calling you a truth.

296
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,240
Four threes.

297
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,580
That's a lie.

298
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,520
That's a lie for sure.

299
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,880
She's checking her cup a lot, man.

300
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,380
I see her checking that cup a lot.

301
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,120
What did you say?

302
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,100
It's just four threes.

303
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,060
Four threes.

304
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,000
That's crazy.

305
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,940
You know what?

306
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,940
Five threes.

307
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,080
Wow.

308
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,960
Wait, what?

309
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,800
That's a lie, Ellen.

310
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,720
Call it out.

311
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,460
I'm calling you a damn liar.

312
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,400
That's one.

313
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,280
That's none.

314
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,820
That's none.

315
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,220
Oh, it's GG.

316
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,280
Oh my god, it was exactly...

317
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,660
Goodbye!

318
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,080
Oh, I'm dead.

319
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,580
I'm out.

320
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,920
Now we just keep going.

321
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,000
Now I expect it.

322
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,980
No, I got the dog out.

323
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,360
Very good.

324
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,120
I can't believe it.

325
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,860
I'm doing this for women everywhere.

326
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,500
You killed the only woman in this collab.

327
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,360
What the fuck do you mean?

328
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,180
Man, that's not looking good, Ellen.

329
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,020
That's not looking good.

330
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,600
You called out a woman as a liar.

331
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,600
That's true.

332
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,080
That's so true.

333
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,180
You're toxic, Ellen.

334
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,800
That's pretty bad.

335
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,980
Not beating the allegations.

336
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,080
Bro, I'm playing the lowest quality.

337
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,500
How is this eating so many of my resources?

338
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,000
Four ones, guys.

339
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,360
Four ones.

340
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,720
Four ones?

341
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,120
Dude, that's such a lie, isn't it?

342
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,500
It's gotta be such a lie.

343
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,400
You already wanna die to that?

344
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,220
Dude, chilled.

345
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,260
You gotta call him out on that.

346
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,080
I'll fucking die for it.

347
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,860
I'll die for it.

348
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,380
You can't let him slide on that.

349
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,200
Zero.

350
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:54,760
No.

351
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,160
Bottoms up, Ellen.

352
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,040
Oh, dude, Ellen's dead.

353
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,720
Wait, so now it's a 1v1?

354
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,860
Yeah, it's a 1v1.

355
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,120
Yeah, okay, you're supposed to...

356
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,380
This game, you're supposed to start off low, but all you guys kept going fives.

357
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,920
I know, Ellen was going a little wild.

358
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,540
Ellen was going fucking wild.

359
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,020
Uh-oh.

360
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,760
Uh-oh.

361
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,860
1v1 got interesting in this game.

362
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,780
Two twos?

363
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,280
Okay.

364
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,840
He's gotta have one, right?

365
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,860
He surely has one.

366
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,800
Three ones?

367
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,080
Three ones?

368
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,100
Yeah.

369
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,620
Impossible.

370
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,460
Do you not have any ones?

371
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,400
No, I have one.

372
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,780
Dude, I thought you were bluffing me.

373
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,500
I thought you were bluffing me, man.

374
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,520
Oh, my God.

375
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,820
I can't believe it.

376
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,440
It's because he has the most experience with this game.

377
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,320
That's true.

378
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,640
That's true.

379
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,080
Next round, now I know how to play.

380
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,160
Now I know how to play.

381
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,740
Dude, it has the Street Fighter thing.

382
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,900
Oh, my God, true.

383
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,380
It does the weird face movements.

384
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,720
Dude, it's because I was the pig.

385
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,580
That's true.

386
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,060
Oh, we gotta be...

387
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,060
If we're all chilled, then we could all win.

388
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,360
Wait, let's all be the bull?

389
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,300
Yeah, except for...

390
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,960
Oh, wait, this is a thing I've seen before.

391
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,800
This is a thing I've seen before.

392
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,580
Oh, wait, I've seen this video.

393
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,740
I've seen this picture before.

394
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,900
Who won, guys, who won?

395
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,200
I won, I won.

396
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,100
You won?

397
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,820
Ready up, ready up.

398
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,680
That was a good time.

399
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,580
You guys are gonna love Liar's Deck then as well.

400
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,620
Liar's Deck is priced.

401
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,080
Oh, Jesus.

402
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,280
I'll start bidding out pretty reasonably.

403
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,880
Just kidding, 4-1.

404
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,500
Dude, that is an awful lie, call him out now.

405
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,200
Yeah, do it, Dougie, do it.

406
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,060
See what happens.

407
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,020
4-1.

408
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,580
I think you're gonna be drinking that poison real fast.

409
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,520
Oh, yeah, this is a quick game.

410
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,620
I swear to God, 4-1.

411
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,140
You can always call 4-2s.

412
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:07,980
There's no way.

413
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,900
I say call him out.

414
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,120
I'm calling you a liar, I'm calling you a fucking liar.

415
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,740
There's no way.

416
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,680
I've got one over here.

417
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,280
There's no way.

418
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,940
Who said call him out?

419
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,980
Who said that?

420
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,060
It was Sykkuno for sure.

421
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,280
I'm never listening to you guys again.

422
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,820
I'm never fucking...

423
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,260
Dude, I can't believe Elim did that to you.

424
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,080
I can't believe it.

425
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,200
I can't believe it.

426
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:42,280
So one thing with the head movements, you can really look at your opponent and really call them a liar straight to the face.

427
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,960
Oh, like it looks where we're looking.

428
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,600
Yeah, it looks where we're looking, it's kind of fun.

429
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,380
The RP element's real nice when we get the...

430
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:56,340
I trusted the person that said he was a woman lover, I trusted that guy.

431
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,480
I can't believe it.

432
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,440
This is how much...

433
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,620
Wait, who did the call?

434
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,140
Doki did?

435
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,640
This is how much of a woman lover I am.

436
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,680
I'm calling you a damn fucking liar.

437
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,160
That's who you are.

438
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,480
You're a damn liar.

439
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,520
Oh shit.

440
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,180
Sykkuno!

441
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,100
Sykkuno!

442
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,140
Why was Doki dead immediately?

443
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,380
Why would you immediately lie?

444
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,000
Why didn't you just do something safe?

445
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,800
I knew it.

446
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,100
I don't want to sit next to Elem anymore.

447
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,980
Elem's just gonna call a liar for everything.

448
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,420
I love women.

449
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,280
Twice you've knocked out a woman.

450
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,640
I'm literally the only woman in this fucking room.

451
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,580
I can't believe Elem did that to you.

452
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,240
Don't get into my chat.

453
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,880
You can't say I'm the worst liar chat.

454
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,480
Elem's literally calling it lies for every single move.

455
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,300
He doesn't care.

456
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,320
I can tell you're a liar.

457
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,220
Call me a liar, Elem.

458
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,160
Call him a liar.

459
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,400
Call me a liar.

460
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,620
You are a fucking liar.

461
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,340
You are a liar.

462
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,760
I knew it.

463
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,580
Oh no, he doesn't.

464
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,780
I knew it.

465
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,060
I told you!

466
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,500
If you die and it's up to Sykkuno, he'll still call him a liar.

467
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,100
It doesn't matter who it is.

468
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,160
I'm about to come back.

469
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,840
It doesn't matter.

470
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,420
Place your last pathetic bid, Sykkuno.

471
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,360
Bro, Chilled is still alive.

472
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,320
He's still alive.

473
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,340
Chilled is playing it safe now.

474
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,740
He's still alive.

475
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,080
I learned from my mistake.

476
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,220
Okay.

477
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,900
Well...

478
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,500
You know what, guys?

479
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,000
Enjoy that, Sykkuno.

480
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,560
You think I'm lying?

481
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,000
Three fives.

482
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Call him a liar.

483
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,900
Call him a fucking liar.

484
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,700
You think I'm lying about that?

485
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,440
What?

486
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,800
Four sixes.

487
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,200
Four sixes?

488
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,780
It's so likely, though.

489
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,080
Call four fives.

490
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,160
No way.

491
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,840
Five sixes?

492
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,820
There ain't no way.

493
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,760
Call him out, bro.

494
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:05,880
You know what?

495
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,540
Five sixes?

496
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:08,880
Nah.

497
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,020
I got two.

498
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,200
Zero.

499
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,060
GG.

500
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,200
No?

501
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,800
I told you.

502
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,260
Ellen will call lies for anything.

503
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,260
There ain't no shot.

504
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,740
That was actually the truth.

505
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,860
I told you.

506
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,100
It doesn't matter who.

507
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,040
He'll call a lie on everybody.

508
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,020
He's not even gonna...

509
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,620
I didn't mean to do that.

510
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,240
Wait.

511
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,360
Wait.

512
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:38,880
Wait.

513
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,240
Wait.

514
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,820
I didn't even look at my hand.

515
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,680
I didn't look at my own hand.

516
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,960
I'm actually just dumb.

517
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,660
I didn't look at my own hand.

518
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,820
I had two sixes.

519
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
There's no way.

520
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,280
That's insane.

521
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,720
That is wild.

522
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,820
I just thought it was so unlikely.

523
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,440
Seven.

524
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,220
That's crazy.

525
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:06,600
That's crazy.

526
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,800
There ain't no way.

527
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,320
Dude, this game is awesome.

528
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,000
Four fours?

529
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,100
Oh, yeah.

530
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,880
Four humble fours.

531
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,280
Four of them?

532
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,370
Dude, I like looking over his calendar.

533
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,010
Five threes.

534
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:29,670
You.

535
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,170
You think I'm gonna fool you?

536
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,210
You think I'm gonna fool for that shield chaos?

537
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,430
When have you never...

538
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,770
When have you not uncalled the liar?

539
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,170
Give me that two.

540
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:39,950
Give me that two.

541
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,650
Goodbye, chill.

542
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,430
Is he dead?

543
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,130
He's dead.

544
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,690
We're so back.

545
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,830
What is that I'm gonna do?

546
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,350
What do you got there, psych?

547
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,510
You can't.

548
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,930
You're the last remaining bull.

549
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,970
You can't lose.

550
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,030
Dude, that's wild.

551
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,470
Because if Elem has no threes, he's gonna call you.

552
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,070
Unless I just have three threes.

553
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,030
What if I have three sixes?

554
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,790
Three sixes?

555
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,710
Yeah, I'm willing to take that.

556
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,670
You can have those two right there, brother.

557
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,950
Oh, you're done, son!

558
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,050
Yes!

559
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,430
The boys!

560
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,610
Yes, my first win.

561
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,190
That's your second game.

562
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,170
He's 50-50.

563
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,590
You're 50-50 paid off.

564
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,370
Oh, no.

565
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,110
Try popping liar's deck.

566
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,070
This one's fun, too.

567
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,230
With cards?

568
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,870
Yeah, you have guns.

569
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,630
No, you can just click it up top.

570
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,470
You get to have a gun.

571
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,570
Click the question mark on it.

572
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,890
The question mark will explain it better than I can.

573
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:54,750
Oh.

574
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,070
Yeah.

575
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,030
Play a card.

576
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,590
Be careful, your opponent might call your bluff.

577
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,410
Oh, and there's Russian Roulette.

578
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:04,590
Yeah.

579
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:12,430
So essentially what's gonna happen is there's gonna be six kings, six queens, and six aces that get dealt out.

580
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,210
And two jokers.

581
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,530
The game is gonna call a certain card.

582
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,330
It's gonna be like queen.

583
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,650
And you all have to claim you're putting down queens and empty your hand.

584
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,030
But of course, you're gonna be lying the whole time because there's no way you can only have queens.

585
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,610
You know what, I'm a hands-on learner.

586
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,850
I'm a hands-on learner, you know?

587
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,030
Yeah, I'm bad at explaining things, too, but you'll see.

588
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,670
Yeah, yeah, we'll figure it out here.

589
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,690
And we are playing with fate.

590
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,250
We have Russian Roulette, too.

591
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,510
We all have a gun.

592
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,910
Can I just shoot Sykuno?

593
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,510
No, you shoot yourself in Minecraft.

594
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,770
Yeah, that's against the spirit of the game.

595
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,030
Deck has six, six, six, and two.

596
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,110
So we are looking for aces.

597
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,950
If you think they're not playing an ace, you call them out.

598
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,030
You can play up to three cards at once.

599
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,310
Okay.

600
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,630
How many aces are there again?

601
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,850
Six, and then two jokers.

602
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,750
And jokers can be anything.

603
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,070
Okay, so I'm looking...

604
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,210
Okay, fine.

605
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,570
So I'm gonna allegedly play one ace.

606
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,570
And if you think I'm gonna tell the truth, or if I'm lying.

607
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,210
And how many aces are there, sorry, again?

608
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,110
Six plus two jokers.

609
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,470
And jokers can be any card.

610
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,930
So technically eight cards.

611
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:21,830
Eight aces, technically.

612
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:22,870
Oh, shit.

613
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,110
And you can play up to three at a time.

614
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:25,570
Oh, God.

615
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,590
And then you just look at someone and you ask, Are you lying to me?

616
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,150
Oh, wow.

617
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:33,670
Wow, Ellen.

618
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,350
That's daring.

619
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,190
Dude, Ellen, you don't want to challenge it, bro.

620
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,450
I'm gonna save your life right now.

621
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,430
Wait.

622
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,270
He's lying.

623
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,970
He can't even look at you in the eyes.

624
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,390
He's lying.

625
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,610
He's 100% lying.

626
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,530
Look at me in the eyes, Ellen.

627
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,010
When you get to my turn, trust me, he's definitely lying.

628
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,590
Do I look like I'm lying?

629
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,550
You look like a trustworthy bull, though.

630
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,650
We're all bulls.

631
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,530
We're all bulls and as a bull.

632
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,730
Enjoy that.

633
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,310
Enjoy that.

634
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,550
Oh, don't you call him a liar.

635
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,110
Call him a liar to his face.

636
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:08,730
Don't you do it.

637
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,170
Don't you do it, Doki.

638
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,950
You know it's full of shit.

639
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,850
No, there's one more eight.

640
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,370
There's one more ace.

641
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,550
There's one more ace.

642
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,350
Well, that means one of them is lying.

643
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,730
I'm doing this for...

644
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,890
Oh, shit.

645
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,270
Oh, so somebody's lying.

646
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,970
Somebody lied in their initial opening hand.

647
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,570
No.

648
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,470
Don't do it, Ellen.

649
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,630
Don't do it, bro.

650
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,570
Look down that barrel.

651
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,690
Look down, DJ.

652
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,730
No, especially with all these lies.

653
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:48,810
Dude, no way.

654
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,270
No way to lush down.

655
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,690
Oh, thank Christ.

656
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,130
Thank Christ.

657
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:54,490
I'm fine.

658
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,310
One pump chump and blew my brains out in the first shot.

659
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,970
Way too high.

660
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,070
Way too high.

661
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:00,850
Okay.

662
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,290
Oh, it's new cards.

663
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,110
Oh, shit.

664
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,230
So we're looking for queens now.

665
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:07,750
Queens.

666
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,530
Queens.

667
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,150
Alright, Ellen.

668
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:10,970
Are you gonna lie?

669
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,770
Are you gonna look at me and lie?

670
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,790
No.

671
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,590
I, to you...

672
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,230
I mean, you fucking...

673
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:17,850
Yeah, no.

674
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,070
You've already, like, showed me how much you hate women.

675
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,370
Three queens?

676
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,250
That's a lie.

677
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,150
That's such a...

678
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:23,830
No, no.

679
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,510
Three queens.

680
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,890
How many queens do you have, Chilled?

681
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,010
Three queens.

682
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:29,970
Legitimately, two.

683
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:30,710
I have two.

684
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,810
How about you, Psych2Go?

685
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,550
I got a couple of them.

686
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,750
How many exactly?

687
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,230
How many exactly?

688
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,390
I don't want to reveal my hands.

689
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,010
That would be a little...

690
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,670
I feel like that would just be a bad idea.

691
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,450
I guess I won't call him a liar then.

692
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,010
That's such an obvious lie.

693
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,990
It's a big lie.

694
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,450
I guess I won't call him a liar then.

695
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,930
Personally, I would have called that out.

696
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:55,590
Two queens.

697
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,290
Felt like he was lying on that one.

698
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,510
Two queens?

699
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:58,850
Dude.

700
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,890
I told her I had two queens.

701
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,030
I played both of them immediately.

702
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,510
Call it.

703
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,630
Call it, Psych2Go.

704
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,070
Yeah, see?

705
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,150
Chilled doesn't lie.

706
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,450
Psych2Go chilled?

707
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,690
Oh, no.

708
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:09,990
Somebody lied.

709
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,970
I technically said I had a couple queens, but I figured it was better not to say exactly how many.

710
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:14,850
That's fair.

711
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,290
Somebody lied about their hand.

712
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,950
Luckily for me, I've still got...

713
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,890
Let's be honest, there's no way Ellum has...

714
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,810
There's no way he's got...

715
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:24,790
There's no way.

716
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,170
There's no way.

717
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,470
You're an idiot.

718
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,330
Oh, hey.

719
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,110
Dude, Ellum's dead, bro.

720
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:37,790
Guys, if I die here, I'll never stream again.

721
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,890
Don't fail me now.

722
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,190
Please, please, please.

723
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,130
I guess he's never streamed.

724
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:48,130
I guess he's had to turn off your stream, I guess.

725
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,650
I guess he's never streamed.

726
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,890
I guess he's never streamed.

727
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,850
He had a good career.

728
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:54,690
He had a career.

729
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,610
He was pretty great.

730
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:56,890
It is what it is, I guess.

731
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,550
Well, there he goes.

732
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,650
Well, you know...

733
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,470
There he goes.

734
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:04,690
Liar.

735
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,190
Oh, yeah?

736
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:07,430
Damn.

737
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,670
Oh, my God.

738
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,450
I want you to look me in the eyes.

739
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,170
Yeah, of course.

740
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,830
You didn't have to ask me.

741
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,870
For a final breath, right?

742
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,910
Yeah, yeah.

743
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,430
Ace's table.

744
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,490
Oh, I could've used that last time.

745
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:27,630
Okay.

746
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,510
How's it like being alive, guys?

747
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,590
It's great.

748
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,310
That was me in the last fucking three games.

749
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,890
Oh, God.

750
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,310
Two aces.

751
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,630
How many aces are in the deck again?

752
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:43,990
Six.

753
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,730
Six and then plus two jokers.

754
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,270
So you can always pair a joker with something.

755
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,250
Oh, joker counts as anything.

756
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:49,970
Oh.

757
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:50,350
Oh.

758
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,290
Oh.

759
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,350
I see.

760
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,230
Three aces.

761
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,370
Three aces?

762
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,470
Hope that pays off.

763
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,390
You trust that?

764
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,570
Come on.

765
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,410
It's so believable.

766
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,690
Yeah, it was.

767
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,870
It was so believable.

768
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,970
One ace.

769
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,990
Oh, that's all the aces.

770
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,870
Sykkuno.

771
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,350
He's lying.

772
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,510
Damn, I had zero aces.

773
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,950
My first two were lies as well.

774
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,850
I knew it.

775
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,570
Here we go.

776
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,170
Oh, God.

777
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,050
I'm the king.

778
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,030
Oh, God.

779
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,390
Oh, there you go.

780
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,610
He lives another day.

781
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,130
He lives another day.

782
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:33,710
Queen.

783
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,830
Wait, I think Elim did quit streaming.

784
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,770
He stopped talking.

785
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,010
If you die in the game, you die in real life.

786
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,110
You die in real life.

787
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,830
Wait, what was it?

788
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:44,350
Queens?

789
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:45,090
Yeah.

790
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:45,950
Those queens.

791
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,690
You put one queen.

792
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,610
I don't got many.

793
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,070
Queen.

794
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,170
Oh.

795
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:54,970
Oh.

796
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,670
You think he's bullshitting on the first turn?

797
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:01,770
That'd be crazy.

798
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,290
That'd be crazy for him to do.

799
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,330
I bullshitted on the first turn.

800
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,810
Just like how I would bullshit as well.

801
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,490
Wait, dude.

802
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,230
She was.

803
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:10,650
Get her.

804
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:11,710
Yeah.

805
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,550
That bullshit on the second turn.

806
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,850
1, 2, 3, 4.

807
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,390
Oh, wow.

808
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:18,610
Me too.

809
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,570
Yeah, I know.

810
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,670
It's so difficult.

811
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,130
Damn.

812
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,050
Don't call it.

813
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,570
Dude, he's gotta be lying.

814
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,470
Yeah, he has to be.

815
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,290
He has to be.

816
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,070
If I die on my first one, I'm gonna die on my first one.

817
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,230
I'm dead on the first one.

818
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,190
Are you feeling lucky?

819
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,010
Don't look.

820
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,730
Oh, he lives.

821
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:49,710
Oh, God.

822
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,730
Ace is table.

823
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,070
Thank God I lived.

824
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,730
Oh, my God.

825
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:56,630
Ace is table.

826
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,670
Maybe you just put 5 bullets in your gun.

827
00:27:59,230 --> 00:27:59,850
Maybe you're not a coward.

828
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:00,130
Yeah, maybe.

829
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,090
He's bullshitting you.

830
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,290
I can read him.

831
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,570
He's trying to get you killed.

832
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,890
If you push that button, you are gonna come out victory.

833
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,150
He's gonna pull that trigger again.

834
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,650
Do it.

835
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,350
It's a promise.

836
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,510
Because I have this.

837
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,090
Get him, Doki.

838
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,090
Three aces?

839
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,250
Dude, she's...

840
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,190
I gotta know what's going on.

841
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,850
Oh, yeah.

842
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,310
No way.

843
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,230
I had two.

844
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,190
There's no way you survived.

845
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,270
Oh, my God.

846
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,930
Is he alive?

847
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,590
He's alive?

848
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,210
The luck.

849
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,530
He has a four-targeted block.

850
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,930
He's halfway through his blitz.

851
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:49,210
It has to be the last chamber.

852
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,970
I hope so.

853
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:51,550
That's crazy.

854
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,090
What was the card?

855
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,110
Ace.

856
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,350
That's a lie.

857
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,110
They're all lies.

858
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,310
That's a secret.

859
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,250
Kula's a lie, brother of aces.

860
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,850
It's a lie for sure.

861
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,470
Nobody ever lies on the first turn.

862
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,390
I know Doki's lying.

863
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,030
It's way too risky to lie.

864
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,050
Exactly.

865
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,410
It's way too risky.

866
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,490
Why would I lie on the first turn?

867
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,110
She might be lying right now.

868
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,990
I think she might be lying.

869
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,310
What do you mean?

870
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:22,990
Too many times.

871
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:26,830
There's no way.

872
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,070
One of us is lying.

873
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,430
There's not enough aces.

874
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,730
You have so many chances.

875
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:34,530
Call him a liar.

876
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,670
Look at me.

877
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,190
Look at what I have.

878
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,110
I didn't put an ace down last round.

879
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,950
He's lying.

880
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,870
He sounded happy about that.

881
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:47,570
Oh no.

882
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,790
No way.

883
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,610
How lucky are you?

884
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,150
How lucky are you?

885
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:56,690
Surely he's dead.

886
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,230
He lives.

887
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,490
How come everyone is surviving this bullshit?

888
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,690
This is so dumb.

889
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,170
You should fix your gun.

890
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:10,390
It feels like the voice coming out of that dead fox's mouth.

891
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,770
Nothing else makes any sense.

892
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,450
Two kings.

893
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,310
Call him Doki.

894
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:17,810
Call him.

895
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,150
Did someone just die in-game?

896
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:24,090
The thing about Russian Roulette is that I can...

897
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:24,690
You're right.

898
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,970
You have one pump jump.

899
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,430
It has happened way too many times.

900
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,430
That's a lie, Doki.

901
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,910
Get his ass.

902
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,570
I also have one king.

903
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,930
That's a lie, Chilled.

904
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,530
None of us wants to call.

905
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,270
Call it.

906
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,610
I also have one king.

907
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:47,970
Alright.

908
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,630
I'm willing to risk it.

909
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,810
I have barely had any kings.

910
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,630
Make him die.

911
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,450
That's right.

912
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:07,810
It's you and I.

913
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,290
You and I, Chilled.

914
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:11,950
Thank Christ.

915
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,290
I already got three shots above mine.

916
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,270
I swear to God, if like...

917
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,830
You got a one pump jump, man.

918
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,650
You're gonna have to one pump jump.

919
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:22,510
I swear to God, if I get one pump, I swear to God.

920
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,790
I swear to God.

921
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,030
Who would lie in the first go?

922
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,350
Nobody dies on the first turn.

923
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,790
Yeah, exactly.

924
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,610
Nobody dies on the first turn.

925
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,330
Dude, that's a lie.

926
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,210
That is such a lie, dude.

927
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,570
He could have a joker.

928
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,650
She's a coward.

929
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,630
She'll never call.

930
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,550
She's a coward.

931
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,630
You're baiting me.

932
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,750
You're baiting me and it worked.

933
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,950
Good luck, coward.

934
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:05,230
Don't look at me.

935
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,090
Don't look at me.

936
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,210
Oh my God.

937
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:11,830
Yeah,

938
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:16,870
yeah, yeah.

939
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,870
Let's see what's going on here.

940
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,890
Let's see what's going on.

941
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,250
Alright, one ace.

942
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,050
That's a lie.

943
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:26,530
It's a lie.

944
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,010
God damn it.

945
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,150
I had one.

946
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,050
I only had one ace.

947
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,290
No way.

948
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,610
Fight the bullet.

949
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,370
I don't want to get L up.

950
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,750
Oh, thank God.

951
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,390
Oh, thank God.

952
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,890
More aces.

953
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,210
How is there all aces?

954
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,070
I'm getting unlucky with aces.

955
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,550
I only had one.

956
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,110
Here we go.

957
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,350
Oh my God.

958
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,550
You're going to do it again, Doki?

959
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,010
You're going to lie to me immediately?

960
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,170
It's a lie.

961
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,290
It's a lie.

962
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,730
It's not true.

963
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:04,430
Come on, Doki.

964
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,510
You need revenge.

965
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:06,830
Call him out.

966
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,770
I don't lie, Doki.

967
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:09,990
That's one thing I don't do.

968
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,310
I'm a truth teller.

969
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,610
Look at these dead people.

970
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:14,450
They thought I lied.

971
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,310
Look what happened to them.

972
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:16,610
Oh, I've been dead.

973
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,030
Yeah, this guy's been dead for a while.

974
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,430
This guy's been dead for a while.

975
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,030
Do it, Doki.

976
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:22,690
I dare you.

977
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,410
I can't.

978
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,830
I'm going to use my ace.

979
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,750
Dude, he's probably going to die here.

980
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,810
He's probably going to die.

981
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:36,730
Yeah, dude, he's probably going to die.

982
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,310
He's probably going to die.

983
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,070
What?

984
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,650
And then I'm going to fucking take your wallet, Zachary.

985
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,030
What the fuck, dude?

986
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:48,830
Good job, Doki.

987
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,510
Good job.

988
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,130
I did it for all the bulls out there.

989
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,810
I heard you did it for the boys.

990
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:55,890
I did it for all the bulls.

991
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,590
Everybody's won a game so far, except for Ellen.

992
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,090
Okay, you piece of shit.

993
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:01,990
Now you're a dog.

994
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,550
I'm staying with the fox.

995
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,570
I've seen this picture also.

996
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:09,850
Wait a second.

997
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,850
You have great taste, Doki.

998
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,150
Lock it in.

999
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,210
Okay, here we go.

1000
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,270
I'm winning this one for sure.

1001
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,630
I'm winning this one for sure.

1002
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,710
I'm going to call Ellen out.

1003
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,650
I'm pretty sure Ellen's going to start lying.

1004
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,570
He's always lying.

1005
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,770
He can't help himself.

1006
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:29,770
It's true.

1007
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,110
If you guys are really dogs, you'd bark.

1008
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:33,910
Not for you.

1009
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,150
Oh my god, dang.

1010
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,070
I hope you get the first shot.

1011
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,150
Oh, I'm not getting the first shot.

1012
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,010
Watch this.

1013
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:41,830
I'm watching.

1014
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,450
It's Queens.

1015
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,110
Oh.

1016
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:48,970
Queens.

1017
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,110
I believe it.

1018
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:53,470
I might be lying.

1019
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,190
Call him a liar, Doki.

1020
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,950
No, because I want to put my cards out first.

1021
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,510
Well, I guess if...

1022
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,050
I mean, look.

1023
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:03,750
I'll...

1024
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,310
Yeah?

1025
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,350
I'll just throw these down real quick.

1026
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:07,750
Three Queens.

1027
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,290
Man, that's such a bold claim.

1028
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,230
Ellen's a terrible liar.

1029
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,150
You know that.

1030
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,350
See, that's the problem.

1031
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,810
I've played a lot of Among Us with him.

1032
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,030
I can't tell if he's lying or just bad at the game sometimes.

1033
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,930
You idiot.

1034
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:24,730
You idiot.

1035
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:25,570
Yes.

1036
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,390
Prepare to get one-pumped.

1037
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:31,950
Enjoy this.

1038
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,250
I'm watching.

1039
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,290
I live these.

1040
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:36,670
No.

1041
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:37,910
No.

1042
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,150
That could have been the end.

1043
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,090
Queens again.

1044
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,830
Yeah, triple Queen, man.

1045
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:45,950
Here we go.

1046
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,550
I hear you.

1047
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,430
What do we got?

1048
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:53,490
It's Queens.

1049
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:55,190
One Queen.

1050
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,790
It's Queens, yep.

1051
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:56,830
One Queen.

1052
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,330
I mean, yeah, it's Queens.

1053
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,510
One Queen.

1054
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,710
None of us are going to lie in the first turn anyway.

1055
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,950
No one would lie, literally.

1056
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,110
No one would lie.

1057
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,190
It's the second turn where we start to lie a lot.

1058
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,830
Yeah, the second turn is when we start lying.

1059
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,010
Because I definitely put a King in there in the first turn.

1060
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:16,970
Yeah.

1061
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,270
100%.

1062
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,430
Three Queens.

1063
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,490
That's a lie.

1064
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:24,490
That's a lie.

1065
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,910
Because one of us is lying and it's not me.

1066
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,030
Oh, you didn't call that?

1067
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:31,630
Oh my god.

1068
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,450
Then why am I going to call you a liar, Doki?

1069
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:35,670
Damn.

1070
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,230
One punch up.

1071
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,250
One punch up.

1072
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,330
I don't die here.

1073
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,490
If I die here, I'll never visit America.

1074
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,150
You already ended your streaming career.

1075
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,870
Yeah, you already ended your streaming career.

1076
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,510
This is literally your last stream.

1077
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,290
My last stream ever, guys.

1078
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,350
That's true.

1079
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,750
I can't believe Liars Bar is the last thing you're ever going to stream.

1080
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:58,490
No.

1081
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,750
Last stream 12 months ago, Liars Bar.

1082
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,390
I wonder what happened.

1083
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,290
Another Ace.

1084
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,790
Well, I mean...

1085
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,750
Surely, no one lies in the first one, right?

1086
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,470
Of course not.

1087
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,310
Why would they?

1088
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:16,290
Surely.

1089
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,610
You're such an asshole.

1090
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,590
I'm fine, everyone.

1091
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:30,970
Enjoy that.

1092
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,490
The second pump.

1093
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,310
Oh my god.

1094
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,070
The second shot.

1095
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,250
He got LM'd hard.

1096
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,070
He ignored his ass.

1097
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,150
Okay.

1098
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,410
Two pump chump.

1099
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,790
Two Aces?

1100
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,430
That's crazy, because I also have two Aces.

1101
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:53,510
You do?

1102
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,010
Wait, I also have two Aces.

1103
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:55,550
Yeah.

1104
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,280
I didn't.

1105
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,380
I just put on a King.

1106
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,840
Two Aces right there, Sykuna.

1107
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,020
You piece of shit.

1108
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,300
Yes!

1109
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,500
Yes!

1110
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,380
No, please don't.

1111
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,120
Are you two pump chump too?

1112
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,720
I knew, because he was taking so long to choose his cards.

1113
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,860
He was thinking, like, how do I...

1114
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,880
How do I lie?

1115
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,220
How do I make this seem less sus?

1116
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,920
Holy shit, I'm safe.

1117
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,820
Yeah, maybe it's your third.

1118
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,860
Sykuna's in your head, man.

1119
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,080
He's going to start to read you.

1120
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:29,600
Yeah.

1121
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,760
We know how you lie now.

1122
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,280
Should I put...

1123
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,600
Oh, yeah.

1124
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,680
That's what I'll be throwing down this...

1125
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,280
Should I put two Kings?

1126
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,420
Or three Kings?

1127
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
Or one King?

1128
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,020
You're playing with three Kings here.

1129
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,580
And one King.

1130
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,080
I'm going to put down...

1131
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,220
One King.

1132
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,400
Okay.

1133
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,860
That was a little slow, LM.

1134
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,560
Don't you think that was a little suspicious?

1135
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,240
That was a little suspicious.

1136
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,300
That's why I'm also going to throw down a King real quick.

1137
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:03,720
Yeah?

1138
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:05,820
Liar!

1139
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,140
Dang it!

1140
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,660
You can't read him!

1141
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,240
You can't read him!

1142
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,420
Why did I do that?

1143
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,040
No!

1144
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,760
No!

1145
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:19,980
No!

1146
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,960
It's so anxiety-inducing.

1147
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,060
The slow call.

1148
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:26,880
Queens.

1149
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,240
How many Queens do I have?

1150
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,100
Oh, shit.

1151
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,340
Okay.

1152
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,780
Oh, shit, I have three Queens.

1153
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,740
Let's go.

1154
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,400
Oh, nice.

1155
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,700
Oh, you do?

1156
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,020
Oh, shit.

1157
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,320
I got three Queens.

1158
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,660
Well, you're going to have three Queens.

1159
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,200
I'm going to use two of my three Queens then.

1160
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,420
Two Queens.

1161
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:50,820
Liar!

1162
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,060
LM, you really don't want that W, do you?

1163
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,560
You really don't want to win.

1164
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,320
I'm literally bulletproof.

1165
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,080
I don't die.

1166
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:02,900
He's dead.

1167
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,980
Oh, he lives another day.

1168
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,660
I'm literally bulletproof.

1169
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,060
Okay.

1170
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,480
King's table.

1171
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,120
King's table.

1172
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,660
Alright, here it is.

1173
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,640
Oh, shit, another three Kings?

1174
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,420
Let's go.

1175
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,060
You have three Kings as well, right, Sykkuno?

1176
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,220
You also have three Kings?

1177
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,040
Yeah, I got three Kings.

1178
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,660
Alright.

1179
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:27,860
Oh, you do?

1180
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,400
There it is.

1181
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,100
Enjoy that.

1182
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,520
He's going to call me.

1183
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,320
I'm going to use one of my three Kings.

1184
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,640
I'll also use one of my three Kings as well.

1185
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,600
How many Kings are in the deck again?

1186
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,480
Six plus two Jokers.

1187
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,060
I'll just use one of my three Kings.

1188
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,080
Dude, that's a lie.

1189
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,040
It's a lie, damn it.

1190
00:40:59,260 --> 00:40:59,660
Call him.

1191
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:00,820
No, it's not.

1192
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,720
He lied the first two cards and he threw all three of them down right now.

1193
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,720
Yeah, that's how I feel too.

1194
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,040
His last card's a lie.

1195
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,320
His last card is a lie.

1196
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,560
Yeah, there's no way.

1197
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,100
There's no fucking way.

1198
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,520
There's no way.

1199
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,680
There's literally no way.

1200
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,080
Dude, I wouldn't be crazy enough to do something like this.

1201
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,180
I wouldn't be crazy enough.

1202
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,000
No, no, definitely not.

1203
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,640
You know what?

1204
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,640
I have the...

1205
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,120
I had no more...

1206
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,000
I had no more...

1207
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,840
I'm dead.

1208
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,480
I'm so dead.

1209
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,380
My luck hasn't been the best.

1210
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,360
Don't look at me.

1211
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,020
I'm looking up.

1212
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:35,840
Don't look at me.

1213
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,480
Oh my God.

1214
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,260
I had no more Kings.

1215
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:46,000
I either get called a liar by LM or I call you a liar.

1216
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,660
I was never going to call you a liar.

1217
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,140
Bro, you every time called me a liar.

1218
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,780
Let me give you a little advice.

1219
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,320
You can get a little crazy.

1220
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,480
LM's not going to call you.

1221
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,200
It's too much of a coward.

1222
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,000
Oh yeah?

1223
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:03,480
Really?

1224
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,680
No, no, no.

1225
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,140
He's not going to call me?

1226
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,940
He's not going to call you.

1227
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,480
Three Kings?

1228
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,700
He won't call you.

1229
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,900
That's insane, dude.

1230
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,440
That's insane.

1231
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,220
There's no way.

1232
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,700
Baited, LM.

1233
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:19,360
Baited.

1234
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,140
You baited me.

1235
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,700
You baited so hard.

1236
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,620
I'm not going to look.

1237
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,660
I'm not going to look at it.

1238
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,660
You're next shot's a 50-50.

1239
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
Yes, I'm fine.

1240
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,320
I'm fine.

1241
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,020
I've got this.

1242
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,660
I've so got this.

1243
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:33,980
I'm fine.

1244
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,320
Dude, I'm up.

1245
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,420
Oh shit.

1246
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,100
Oh shit.

1247
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,940
It's fine.

1248
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:43,960
Don't worry.

1249
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,380
You know Sykuno's not going to call you.

1250
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,220
He hasn't been calling people out since.

1251
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,420
Oh yeah, I'm just playing safe.

1252
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,020
Yeah, he's just playing safe.

1253
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,040
I mean, you wouldn't...

1254
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,840
You wouldn't call me out, right?

1255
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,060
Sykuno, you wouldn't call me out if I just played three Queens, right?

1256
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,680
Go ahead.

1257
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,100
Go ahead.

1258
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,380
Yeah, he's not going to.

1259
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,580
He's going to put another two.

1260
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,340
I'll just play my own.

1261
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,200
Yeah, that's fine.

1262
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,960
And then I'll play my own too.

1263
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:08,740
Two Queens.

1264
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,580
Okay, a total of seven Queens have been played.

1265
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,420
Yeah, seven Queens.

1266
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,580
That means there's one Queen left.

1267
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:14,700
There's one Queen left.

1268
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,280
That's all I'm saying.

1269
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,120
There's one Queen left.

1270
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,280
Oh my god.

1271
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,320
You've got to call him.

1272
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,220
You've got to call him.

1273
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,760
I swear to god, if I die.

1274
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,660
I swear to god, if I die.

1275
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,120
You can hear Nelum's voice that he doesn't have any more Queens.

1276
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,600
Yeah, he doesn't have any more Queens.

1277
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,540
He doesn't play anything.

1278
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,580
He's got one card left.

1279
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,780
You've got to call him.

1280
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,300
You can tell he's desperate.

1281
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,640
You've got to call him, Doki.

1282
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,020
Yes.

1283
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,300
No!

1284
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:40,780
No!

1285
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,660
Oh my god.

1286
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,360
Because I didn't have a Queen.

1287
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,260
I had no Queens.

1288
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,700
I was going to call my Queen.

1289
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,680
Don't do it.

1290
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,940
It was another day.

1291
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:53,920
It was another day.

1292
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,260
You survived for so long.

1293
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,840
I had like two Queens in my hand.

1294
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,240
I just didn't want to use them because I was greedy.

1295
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:03,580
How does that work?

1296
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,760
You can save it to the end.

1297
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,340
What is this?

1298
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,080
Aces table?

1299
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,180
Yeah, yeah.

1300
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,780
Oh, it's a lie.

1301
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:12,560
Two Aces.

1302
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,260
Two Aces.

1303
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,380
Oh dude, Nelum's taking too long.

1304
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,120
He's lying for sure.

1305
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,400
Oh yeah, he's been lying.

1306
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,400
He takes too long.

1307
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,960
Now he's flushed out and panicked.

1308
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,680
Yeah, now he's...

1309
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,900
It wasn't two Aces.

1310
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,040
How?

1311
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,020
Oh my god, dude.

1312
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,320
How?

1313
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,740
You have a pattern.

1314
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,860
I recognize you.

1315
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,360
You have a tail.

1316
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,540
I'm not telling you.

1317
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,360
I know your tail.

1318
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,800
I'm dead, dude.

1319
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,320
I'm dead.

1320
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,320
Oh my god.

1321
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,680
How is he still alive right now?

1322
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,840
How are you still alive, Elum?

1323
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,600
I'm bulletproof.

1324
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,340
I told you.

1325
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,160
I'm literally bulletproof.

1326
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,560
Oh god.

1327
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,440
I'm like the Wolverine.

1328
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,020
Okay.

1329
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,020
Okay, okay.

1330
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,380
Definitely a lie.

1331
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,380
Call him out.

1332
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:05,960
Call him out quick.

1333
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:06,960
Two Aces.

1334
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:07,940
Quick, Doki.

1335
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:08,740
Get his ass.

1336
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:14,620
I mean, if you're playing two Aces, I might as well play an Ace.

1337
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,800
Yeah, I mean, if you guys are playing an Ace, then I guess I should probably also play an Ace, I guess.

1338
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:20,940
Yeah, me too.

1339
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:22,560
Okay.

1340
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,700
Just keep going.

1341
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,000
Yeah, play my one Ace as well.

1342
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:28,940
Yeah, and then you know what?

1343
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,200
I'll just...

1344
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,480
Yeah?

1345
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:33,940
Just play my Ace.

1346
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:34,680
It's all good.

1347
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:35,840
Oh.

1348
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,680
Stupid fuck.

1349
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,500
Dude, I had none left.

1350
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,140
I had none left, man.

1351
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,040
Dude, I had like zero Aces, man.

1352
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,640
I was dead this whole time.

1353
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,400
Join me.

1354
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,020
Dude, Elum might win this.

1355
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,560
This could be my time.

1356
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,140
This could be it now.

1357
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,360
I'm doing this for women everywhere.

1358
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,060
Elum could win this right now.

1359
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,220
Oh, by beating a woman?

1360
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,340
Elum could win this right now.

1361
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,240
Here we go.

1362
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,940
Elum could win this right now.

1363
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:09,960
Two?

1364
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,920
Well, then I guess there's only four left.

1365
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,360
No, there's seven.

1366
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,060
Yeah, there's eight.

1367
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,200
And then I guess I'll play these three then.

1368
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,140
Oh, you're gonna play these three?

1369
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,560
Guess I'll just...

1370
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,980
Guess if you have three, then I'll play the sixth queen.

1371
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,500
Oh, that makes sense.

1372
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,200
I guess then I'll just go...

1373
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,720
Yeah, I mean, I'll just play this one then.

1374
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,220
Yeah, and then I guess...

1375
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:37,640
Liar.

1376
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,220
Yes.

1377
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,480
I didn't have a queen left.

1378
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,580
You did not call the three.

1379
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,000
I didn't have...

1380
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,080
I guess I only had one queen and one joker.

1381
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,580
Oh, no, please.

1382
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,680
Please, I can't.

1383
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,920
Oh my god, she's alive.

1384
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,240
He's on a 50-50 dokey.

1385
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,600
There's no way.

1386
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,080
There's literally no way.

1387
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,320
Oh my god.

1388
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,400
Okay.

1389
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:03,680
Okay.

1390
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,400
What seems to be the problem, Elum?

1391
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,300
Nothing, nothing.

1392
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,340
What's going on?

1393
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:11,980
What's going on?

1394
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,760
I'm gonna play the riskiest play of my life right now.

1395
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,520
Play your last pathetic card before you die.

1396
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:18,500
Fine.

1397
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,720
I'm flirting with danger.

1398
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,220
Enjoy those two kings.

1399
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,440
That's such a lie.

1400
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,200
You piece of shit.

1401
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,660
That was such an obvious lie.

1402
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,400
Luckily for you guys, I'm bulletproof.

1403
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,240
I survived the show.

1404
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,900
Alright, that's 50-50.

1405
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,040
There's no way.

1406
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:41,520
I'm alive.

1407
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,020
No way, he's on his last...

1408
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,740
Okay, he's at 5 out of 6 though.

1409
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,780
He's dead on the next turn.

1410
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,140
What kind of fucking character arc is this?

1411
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,400
He's gotta be dead on the next turn.

1412
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,100
He's got main protagonist energy.

1413
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:53,460
What?

1414
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,720
This is bullshit.

1415
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,340
He's on that last bullet.

1416
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,960
Oh my god.

1417
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,320
Well, I guess I'll just play these then.

1418
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:03,760
Liar.

1419
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,400
You fucking asshole.

1420
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,400
There's no way.

1421
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,700
You're fucking dead.

1422
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,580
Luckily, there was no...

1423
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,020
Look at me in the eye.

1424
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,040
Look at me in the eye.

1425
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:21,960
Let's fucking go.

1426
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,680
And now all my friends are dead.

1427
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,320
Let's go.

1428
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,540
It didn't give me one queen.

1429
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,300
I didn't get one.

1430
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,380
I literally only got one.

1431
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,660
Alright, let's do it.

1432
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:35,860
I could probably do it.

1433
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,200
Let's do it.

1434
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,740
It's pretty simple.

1435
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:42,940
It's intense.

1436
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,020
They're gonna add in, I guess, two more games as well.

1437
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,120
I know Russian Roulette, they're gonna add in to just pure Russian Roulette.

1438
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,280
And then one other game as well.

1439
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,080
I think it might be poker.

1440
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,600
Russian Roulette?

1441
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:54,240
How would you lie for Russian Roulette?

1442
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,600
I don't think you lie.

1443
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,440
I think you just pull the trigger.

1444
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,680
That's gonna be out.

1445
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,660
That one's just...

1446
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,380
Oh my god, imagine all the money I could've won if this was...

1447
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:04,680
in-game.

1448
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:09,880
We did this a couple days ago with drinking and you had to take a shot every time you died.

1449
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,840
That's crazy.

1450
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,320
Yeah, that would be crazy.

1451
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,620
Here we go.

1452
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,500
Here we go.

1453
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,760
It's been so long since I've seen my hand after blowing my brains out.

1454
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,440
Oh yeah, you were dead for so long.

1455
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,260
Yeah, you were dead for so long.

1456
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,000
We lived for so long here.

1457
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,160
Dude, he died like immediately.

1458
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,140
That's such a lie.

1459
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,040
That's such a lie.

1460
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,160
That's such a lie too.

1461
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:34,680
Liar.

1462
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:36,040
Damn.

1463
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:36,340
What?

1464
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,320
Damn.

1465
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,020
I told you, Elim always calls me a liar.

1466
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:42,780
Every time.

1467
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,820
Dude, if Elim dies immediately right here...

1468
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,300
He's looking into the sky.

1469
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,360
Bro.

1470
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,360
He's crazy.

1471
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,580
He's actually crazy.

1472
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:54,720
Bro.

1473
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,160
He's out of control.

1474
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,700
I knew it.

1475
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,120
He's playing with fire right now.

1476
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:03,160
Oh.

1477
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:08,200
I guess I'll just throw that down real quick.

1478
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,560
Oh, you're going to play one king?

1479
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,000
Yeah, I'll just play one real quick.

1480
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,200
It's a lie.

1481
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:13,940
One king?

1482
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,680
You also have one king?

1483
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,400
Call him out.

1484
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,520
I don't think he's lying.

1485
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,420
Oh my god, you're right.

1486
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,340
Because I also have two kings, but I'm going to place one king.

1487
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:26,540
Oh.

1488
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,180
Well, luckily for me, I also have one king.

1489
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,480
And I'll just play that real quick.

1490
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,440
Yeah, that's your last king.

1491
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,440
Why won't you look at Sukuna?

1492
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,460
No reason.

1493
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,500
Oh wow, we all have one king.

1494
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,760
That's crazy, guys.

1495
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,000
Yeah, me too.

1496
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,960
I also have one king, guys.

1497
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,480
We all have one king.

1498
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,840
Guys, I'm out of kings at this point.

1499
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:49,900
I am out of kings.

1500
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,660
I'll just play my king real quick.

1501
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,980
Yeah, me too.

1502
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,800
I'll just play my one king as well.

1503
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,000
My one king.

1504
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:58,880
I'll just play my king real quick.

1505
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,460
Yeah, I'll play my one king as well.

1506
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,520
But before that...

1507
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,360
Before what?

1508
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,800
Before that...

1509
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,120
No!

1510
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,500
Joker's wild.

1511
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:11,800
No!

1512
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:12,820
I have no more kings!

1513
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,600
And I think Alan was going to call me out.

1514
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:14,980
No!

1515
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:15,800
Don't look at me!

1516
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,620
I'm going to look away!

1517
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:17,640
Don't look at me!

1518
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,080
Dude, first shot?

1519
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:20,780
No!

1520
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,240
I want too many kings!

1521
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,080
Alan's just as all things should be.

1522
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,840
I want too many kings!

1523
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,820
This is awesome.

1524
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,820
This is awesome.

1525
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,740
Well, I guess I'll just select these real quick.

1526
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,100
Thank you so much.

1527
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:39,560
Liar!

1528
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,340
Damn!

1529
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,580
He's got your number!

1530
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,860
He's got your number!

1531
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,060
He's dead, bro.

1532
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:47,600
He's dead.

1533
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,360
Put him down.

1534
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,320
He's done.

1535
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,820
You're done, Alan.

1536
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,220
I don't understand!

1537
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,720
Why does God like him?

1538
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,620
Yeah, why does Alan have the best luck?

1539
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,260
It's crazy.

1540
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,180
It's crazy, man.

1541
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,160
Somebody strike him down right now.

1542
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,580
I want someone to smite him.

1543
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,160
You got good shit.

1544
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,260
I got good shit.

1545
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,460
I guess I'll just play this as one ace real quick.

1546
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,460
He's going to call you out.

1547
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:15,900
One ace?

1548
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:18,680
I'll just play my one ace now.

1549
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:19,480
That makes sense.

1550
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,020
Three aces?

1551
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,140
You gotta call that, dude.

1552
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,660
You gotta call that.

1553
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,940
I was lying to that one.

1554
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,100
I was trying to get rid of all my garbage.

1555
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:29,720
That was crazy.

1556
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,540
That was a big ass bluff right there.

1557
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,120
That's insane.

1558
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,180
I put no bullets in here.

1559
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:36,540
I'm fine.

1560
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,380
Who lies on all three of them?

1561
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:40,880
That's crazy.

1562
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,480
You didn't even put one of them in there?

1563
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,340
No way, man.

1564
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,180
I'm a wild child.

1565
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,140
Here we go.

1566
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:51,660
Oh.

1567
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,360
Oh.

1568
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,800
I have Ellen's stream open right now.

1569
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,100
He has three kings.

1570
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,280
Ellen, you have three kings?

1571
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:01,580
Why don't I?

1572
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,980
Yeah, he does.

1573
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,780
I have his stream open right now.

1574
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,400
He has three kings.

1575
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,200
That felt like bullshit to me.

1576
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,600
No, he actually has three kings.

1577
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:14,980
Dude, I ain't calling it.

1578
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,760
I'm playing it safe out here.

1579
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,100
That's five.

1580
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:18,940
That's six.

1581
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,120
That was such a lie.

1582
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:20,860
Call him quick.

1583
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,580
He wants you dead, Ellen.

1584
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,160
Don't call him.

1585
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,660
Call my next one.

1586
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,140
I have his stream open.

1587
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,540
Two kings?

1588
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:30,000
Lies, bro.

1589
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:30,640
Lies.

1590
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,220
It would be funny if Ellen did have three kings.

1591
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:33,160
No way.

1592
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,040
How?

1593
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,860
Dude, he actually has three kings.

1594
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,780
He actually has three kings.

1595
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,440
That's crazy.

1596
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,800
Oh my god.

1597
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,380
Oh my god.

1598
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:49,940
Somehow he's alive.

1599
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:50,340
Somehow.

1600
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,520
This is only his first shot, right?

1601
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,420
Here we go.

1602
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:56,840
Oh.

1603
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:58,720
Oh.

1604
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:00,900
Hmm.

1605
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,960
Wait, is it my turn?

1606
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:05,600
Yeah.

1607
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,740
I think you're full of shit.

1608
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,260
I got kings.

1609
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,380
He's lying, by the way.

1610
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,280
Those were kings.

1611
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,840
No, he's totally lying.

1612
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,880
How many jokers in there?

1613
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,340
I know his tell.

1614
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,260
I won't say it.

1615
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:22,540
He's lying.

1616
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,200
Dude, I'm dead.

1617
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:27,880
Wait a second.

1618
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:30,620
Did you actually put two kings at the first try?

1619
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,700
No, I had zero kings.

1620
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,020
I knew it.

1621
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,360
I know your tell.

1622
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,400
I'm not going to say it.

1623
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,280
I know your tell.

1624
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,120
I had no kings.

1625
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,840
I know when you're lying.

1626
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,060
I don't have one.

1627
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,740
I'm unreadable.

1628
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:49,440
I got all my predictions correct.

1629
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,520
Bro, I got nothing.

1630
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,520
He's just not going to say anything after that.

1631
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,920
LM, call him, bro.

1632
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:01,460
Call him.

1633
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,080
He just said he had nothing.

1634
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,080
I know he's a liar.

1635
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,700
Dude, you're insane for that.

1636
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,680
You're actually insane.

1637
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,820
Bro, you always get baited by someone.

1638
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,480
Every time.

1639
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,500
Every time he tells you.

1640
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,680
I got one pumped.

1641
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,200
What is this bullshit?

1642
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,220
Yes.

1643
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,400
This is awesome.

1644
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,340
It's LM's turn, right?

1645
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:35,480
Oh, it's my turn.

1646
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,260
Put down all your cards.

1647
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,560
Spam that X button.

1648
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,300
He's not.

1649
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,420
He's telling the truth.

1650
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,260
He's telling the truth.

1651
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,380
You think so?

1652
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,760
I know you're not telling the truth.

1653
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,640
I know you're not telling the truth.

1654
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,000
Would you stake your reputation?

1655
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:57,900
My reputation?

1656
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,040
She's dead, dude.

1657
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,540
What reputation?

1658
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,520
I'm not even alive anymore.

1659
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,380
I hope you're not lying to me.

1660
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,560
No, dude.

1661
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:08,120
No.

1662
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,560
She is reading you.

1663
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,280
I know.

1664
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:11,340
I know.

1665
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:19,040
I know what you do when you're lying.

1666
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,100
It's so obvious.

1667
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,840
Dude, I lie.

1668
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,560
I lie like 80% of the time.

1669
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,540
I don't know why.

1670
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:33,840
I literally have the cards and I'm like, man, it would feel nice to use the not cards.

1671
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,460
Yeah, would you?

1672
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,660
Oh, man.

1673
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:39,480
Lie.

1674
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,300
That's a lie.

1675
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:40,820
It's a lie.

1676
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:41,580
It's a lie.

1677
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:42,320
Get him chilled.

1678
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:43,460
He's not.

1679
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,280
He's not.

1680
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:45,780
Get his ass.

1681
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:46,520
Elim.

1682
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,220
Okay, I'm sorry, Sakuno.

1683
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,200
Will you call Elim a liar for me?

1684
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:52,480
Alright, I'll do it.

1685
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:52,840
I'll do it.

1686
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:53,840
No, no, no.

1687
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:54,920
No, no, no.

1688
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,940
Dude, Elim.

1689
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:57,360
Come on.

1690
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,020
You gotta call that.

1691
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,680
Dude, there's no way.

1692
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,840
I just put down three queens for real.

1693
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,320
Bro, I just put down three.

1694
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,000
Dude, you're a joker.

1695
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:09,600
That's why.

1696
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:10,120
The joker.

1697
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,380
I'm the joker.

1698
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,140
There's no way.

1699
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,980
There's no way, Elim.

1700
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,100
Are you serious?

1701
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,980
How does he live all day?

1702
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,660
Dude, I'm totally blowing my brains out immediately.

1703
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:27,020
Bro, the content gods want Elim to win so badly.

1704
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:30,080
He's never streaming again, though.

1705
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:30,480
Why?

1706
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,920
It's his last shebang.

1707
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,640
It's his last frontier.

1708
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,940
Let me throw these down real quick.

1709
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,420
God's favorite child.

1710
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,560
Two queens.

1711
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,680
I got three queens.

1712
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:43,220
It's a lie.

1713
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:44,500
Yes.

1714
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:48,120
How many shots are above my head?

1715
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,820
Why were you listening to Elim?

1716
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,400
His calls have been wrong.

1717
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,760
His tells have been wrong.

1718
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,620
He dies on the second one.

1719
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,620
Oh, he lives.

1720
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,580
Wait guys, how many more bullets do I have?

1721
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,160
You have two.

1722
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:03,360
You have 50-50.

1723
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:07,720
You think you're gonna win the 50-50 again?

1724
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,980
Elim, call him out on a lie.

1725
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,280
Call him out.

1726
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,340
Take that 50-50, Elim.

1727
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,620
No way, man.

1728
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,300
Take that 50-50.

1729
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,040
Take that 50-50, Elim.

1730
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,040
You're gonna die, man.

1731
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,120
Aw, you should have taken it.

1732
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,560
Chill, were you lying?

1733
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,500
I need to know.

1734
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:25,980
I was lying.

1735
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,300
I knew it.

1736
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,860
Elim, you should have taken that 50-50.

1737
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,500
You should have taken it.

1738
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,900
No, you can't.

1739
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:35,380
What about now?

1740
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,720
I'm not saying it.

1741
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:38,880
I'm not saying it.

1742
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,860
You don't have a fucking king.

1743
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,360
That's a lie.

1744
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,860
No, it's not.

1745
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,300
It's definitely not.

1746
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:51,480
Dude, that's a lie.

1747
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,360
There's no kings left.

1748
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,840
They hid it.

1749
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,620
Dude, Elim's gotta be ill.

1750
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,420
Elim, you should have taken it.

1751
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,200
You should have called him out on the first try.

1752
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,080
You should have called him out on the first try.

1753
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,560
You should have called him out.

1754
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,840
You should have called him out on the first try.

1755
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:15,280
You're three to six.

1756
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,140
You're three to six.

1757
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:17,960
I'm three out of six?

1758
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,380
I'm gonna die then.

1759
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:20,660
Possibly.

1760
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,440
Finally, God's favorite child is dead.

1761
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,480
But on Sunday, you'll get resurrected.

1762
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,220
Don't worry, Elim.

1763
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:27,820
Surely.

1764
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,240
Thank God.

1765
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:32,560
Die.

1766
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,580
I'll be fine.

1767
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,160
We'll get some lunch tomorrow.

1768
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:39,960
I'll be okay.

1769
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:41,640
In heaven.

1770
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,420
Oh, JK in hell.

1771
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,700
Good job.

1772
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:47,240
That's crazy.

1773
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,380
The only reason I called that lie was because I literally had zero.

1774
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,600
So I was like, well, I'd rather just...

1775
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,140
You didn't want to risk it.

1776
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:56,980
I'd rather just go on the offensive here.

1777
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,160
One more.

1778
00:59:58,740 --> 00:59:59,620
Oh, he's already gone.

1779
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,780
Wait, what the fuck?

1780
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,860
Oh, hey, welcome back.

1781
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:07,960
What happened?

1782
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:10,060
I just clicked the wrong button.

1783
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,120
I had three queens.

1784
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,560
I was trying to lie on the first one.

1785
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,960
Yeah, we were like, oh my...

1786
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,700
I was just going to slow off the rest.

1787
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,880
The only reason I called it was because I had zero queens.

1788
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,120
And I was like, well, I'd rather just go for it.

1789
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:25,540
I thought you rage-quitted after that.

1790
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:29,380
We just died an insta-dip.

1791
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,220
I just didn't want to ruin anybody's immersion.

1792
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,800
After dying, I was just gonna peace.

1793
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:35,620
One more chilled, one more.

1794
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,260
I can't, I gotta jump to another.

1795
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,720
We can find a fill.

1796
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,160
Guys, that was absolutely blessed.

1797
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,240
Dude, I'm liking this game.

1798
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:51,340
We'll do the Mario Party Jamboree when it comes out.

1799
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,460
Oh, sweet, yeah.

1800
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:01,060
Thank god we've got so many friends, right guys?

1801
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,920
Alright, who's our plus one?

1802
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:03,700
Who are we getting?

1803
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,780
We could just find somebody instantly.

1804
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,240
How instant is instantly?

1805
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:11,340
We got them instantly, like straight off the Ripperoo.

1806
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,360
Yeah, where?

1807
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,360
I'm messaging right now.

1808
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,040
I'm messaging, somebody will respond.

1809
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,000
One person, someone out there.

1810
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,860
Without a doubt, someone will reply.

1811
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,700
Dude, I'm liking this game, it's kinda fun.

1812
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,360
Dude, this game is good.

1813
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,980
It's really fun.

1814
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,460
I genuinely am really enjoying this game.

1815
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:39,960
Just the mind games.

1816
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:40,500
Okay.

1817
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,000
I might have someone, but I'm not sure.

1818
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,320
I'm gonna be honest, they said, What is that?

1819
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,300
I think I have him on the hook here.

1820
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,180
What is that?

1821
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,000
Someone replied to me saying that as well.

1822
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,280
I think I got him on the hook right here.

1823
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:02,140
Wait, who did you get?

1824
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,380
I think Hewn's down.

1825
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,360
If that's the same person you also asked.

1826
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,520
That's not the person I asked.

1827
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:12,560
The person I asked said they need a couple minutes.

1828
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:14,420
Who the fuck is Price?

1829
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,440
Oh, somebody's lobby code is leaked.

1830
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,620
Wait, there's a lobby code?

1831
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,180
Yeah, it's at the very bottom.

1832
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,520
The lobby ID.

1833
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:25,800
Did Hewn already accept?

1834
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,440
Because I got a guy who also can show up.

1835
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:31,340
Let me...

1836
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:31,760
Alright.

1837
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,340
50-50

1838
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:39,410
No, it's okay.

1839
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:41,350
She's still in bed.

1840
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:52,190
I got one of my friends.

1841
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:53,210
He's a good friend of mine.

1842
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:54,910
He'll be here in a minute.

1843
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,490
You know what we can do while we're waiting though?

1844
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:59,230
We can play some Street Fighter.

1845
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:00,390
Okay, no.

1846
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:01,450
I uninstalled it.

1847
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:08,870
I uninstalled it.

1848
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,930
Why would you uninstall it?

1849
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:13,430
Because it's over.

1850
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:15,230
The slam is over.

1851
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,150
Do I just add him to this call?

1852
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:18,990
Because we're already here.

1853
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:20,070
Yeah, just add him to the call.

1854
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,070
Bring him in.

1855
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:24,690
Mr. Raymond.

1856
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:27,690
Yeah, this is gonna be cooked.

1857
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:28,870
It's time.

1858
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:30,770
We got Ray.

1859
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,390
Oh, yeah.

1860
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:35,210
Oh, yeah.

1861
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,270
Should I just make a lobby again?

1862
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:40,730
Private.

1863
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:43,050
Join up, guys.

1864
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:43,710
Join up.

1865
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:45,890
Alright, I'm gonna join.

1866
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:48,570
Join.

1867
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:49,330
Join.

1868
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:51,830
I invite you, Psych.

1869
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:52,990
I'm in.

1870
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:55,850
You can just join via friends list, by the way.

1871
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:57,390
Oh, you can?

1872
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:59,210
Yeah, that's what I did.

1873
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:02,490
Okay, he better join in before this person...

1874
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:05,330
before some random comes in and tries to join.

1875
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:08,350
Guys, I've been just permanently leaking the lobby every time.

1876
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:09,950
Oh my god.

1877
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:11,510
There's even a lobby code?

1878
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:12,710
It's at the very bottom.

1879
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:16,450
Why don't we all be the fox lady?

1880
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:18,850
Yeah, you know what?

1881
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:20,430
We should all be the foxy lady.

1882
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:21,970
What about the pig, guys?

1883
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:23,550
He seems like a happy chap.

1884
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:24,350
You know?

1885
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:26,410
You would pick the pig.

1886
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,450
Ray, what do you think about that?

1887
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:30,310
No, nothing.

1888
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:33,110
No, it's nothing.

1889
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:33,670
It's fine.

1890
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:34,310
It's okay.

1891
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:35,830
No, no, no.

1892
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,270
It just works for you.

1893
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:40,550
Icefield, can you kindly piss off?

1894
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:45,510
I don't know which side you're from, but fuck off.

1895
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,290
It's not mine because my code is...

1896
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:56,070
It can't be me because the code is blocked on my end.

1897
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:58,930
I'm just not even hiding it.

1898
01:04:59,210 --> 01:04:59,950
No, neither am I.

1899
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:03,030
Ray...

1900
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,670
Is he downloading the game?

1901
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,680
Kick him, bro.

1902
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,080
Kick him.

1903
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,680
He'll learn his lesson.

1904
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:15,340
Surely, right?

1905
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:15,880
Surely.

1906
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,380
He'll learn his lesson eventually.

1907
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:20,040
Surely, he'll eventually get the picture.

1908
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:20,940
Surely.

1909
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,260
Dude.

1910
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,640
And now there's others.

1911
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,680
It's because we all talked about the code so they're all inputting it now.

1912
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:34,980
The craziest part is that they're typing it physically.

1913
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,720
One by one with their fingers.

1914
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:39,220
Dude, it's such a long number as well.

1915
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,800
I know, that's what I was thinking.

1916
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,860
It's such a long number.

1917
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:43,720
They have to type it.

1918
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:47,160
Yeah, no, that is dedication.

1919
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,000
It's so tiny, too, the numbers.

1920
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:55,420
Ray mid-chase.

1921
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,760
Nah, dude, he said he's just dropping off the stuff and he's good.

1922
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,340
Oh, is he playing GTA?

1923
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,120
He's in GTA roleplay, yeah.

1924
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:10,000
He's got an OOC right now and be like, sorry, I gotta go play Russian Roulette now.

1925
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:11,860
Yeah, dude, should I log in and...

1926
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,120
Wait, do you play roleplay?

1927
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:14,600
GTRP?

1928
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,240
Yeah, how do you know those terms?

1929
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:17,620
OOC?

1930
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,380
What do you mean?

1931
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,280
That's roleplay for everything.

1932
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,080
Out of character.

1933
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,740
How do you know that?

1934
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,960
Most people would have no idea what that means.

1935
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,620
GTRP is so famous.

1936
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:32,760
What do you mean?

1937
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:35,140
People know the terms, though.

1938
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,540
Dude, I didn't know the terms.

1939
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:38,700
You recognized the terms.

1940
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,300
You literally recognized it.

1941
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,020
You should join GTA roleplay.

1942
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,120
Oh, man, I never got a chance to try it.

1943
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:47,420
I don't know.

1944
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,660
I think you'd enjoy it.

1945
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:51,480
You're like super social, so I think you'd enjoy it.

1946
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:51,880
I could.

1947
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,340
I know a guy, he could set you up.

1948
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,560
Yeah, isn't the server been out already for a long time?

1949
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,740
Yeah, I think you should just start on the next fresh start, maybe.

1950
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:11,040
Yeah, I know it's like people usually start when it's like the fresh server, so people establish new characters.

1951
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,480
I'm down.

1952
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:18,080
When's the next restart?

1953
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,780
When GTA 6 comes out.

1954
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:21,280
Oh, next year.

1955
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:22,900
I'm just kidding.

1956
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:24,640
I don't know.

1957
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,260
I feel like no one really knows, to be honest with you.

1958
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,320
Okay, I think Ray's about to be here.

1959
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:35,540
He's going into the headquarters and dropping his loot off.

1960
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,660
I'm stream sniping him.

1961
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:38,320
Oh, shit.

1962
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,660
I'm going to report you for stream sniping.

1963
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,380
Guy said he's going to be back on GTA in 30 minutes.

1964
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,280
He doesn't know how addicting this game is.

1965
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,800
Wait, what?

1966
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,080
So he's just going to play for 30 minutes and then he's going to peace out?

1967
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,960
Once he plays, he's going to be stuck here for a while.

1968
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:59,400
This is also a very Ray game.

1969
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:04,700
When I was playing this, I was like, dude, this would be a good game for Ray.

1970
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:06,100
He just enjoys that.

1971
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:10,820
Download the game.

1972
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:13,680
I have a feeling you'll enjoy this game.

1973
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,340
Yeah, this is such a you game, dude.

1974
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:16,940
I know it sounds okay.

1975
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,240
Even though we originally described it, you're going to be like, okay.

1976
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:23,520
But trust me, when you start playing it, it's really fucking fun.

1977
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:24,120
Oh, perfect.

1978
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,640
You guys can't hear them?

1979
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,360
Yeah, you can just join off of me otherwise, Ray.

1980
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,780
You met Doki before, right?

1981
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,000
No, I don't think we met.

1982
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,660
You haven't met Doki Bird?

1983
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,220
The greatest VTuber of our generation.

1984
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,160
Oh my god, me?

1985
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,600
No, that's Iron Mouse.

1986
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,520
The greatest VTuber who streams on YouTube.

1987
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,600
We'll take the competition out.

1988
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,000
We'll just make it simple like that?

1989
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,180
Yeah, we'll start limiting it.

1990
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,240
Alright, let me raise your volume a little bit, Ray.

1991
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:01,800
Wait, wait.

1992
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,120
Elim, you gotta kick this dude.

1993
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:06,240
I should piss off.

1994
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,220
I don't think they're gonna stop, Elim.

1995
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,560
I just wonder why.

1996
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,400
He knows he's just gonna get kicked.

1997
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:14,660
Like, he knows he's getting kicked.

1998
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:16,580
What's the game called?

1999
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:18,540
Okay, it's gonna be a while.

2000
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,000
Let's just keep him in there until he's ready.

2001
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,520
It's called Liar's Bar.

2002
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,420
Liar's Bar.

2003
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,800
Alright, chat, is his volume okay?

2004
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:36,820
I'm gonna raise you up just a little bit more.

2005
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:40,240
How good are you at lying, Ray?

2006
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,600
I'm really bad at lying.

2007
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,020
He's an expert.

2008
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,940
Oh, what has he done to you, Sykuno?

2009
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,320
No, that was a lie right there.

2010
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,640
He already tricked you, see?

2011
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,800
He just said he was bad at lying.

2012
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:53,720
You fell for it.

2013
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:55,440
You've been duped already.

2014
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:57,760
I meant you, Sykuno.

2015
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:58,840
You said he's an expert.

2016
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,400
That means he's lied to you multiple times.

2017
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:02,880
So what has he done?

2018
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:03,300
To me?

2019
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,520
No, no, no.

2020
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,120
He only lies to protect me because he's my buddy.

2021
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,420
We played a lot of RP, I'll be honest.

2022
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:13,660
He would never do it to me.

2023
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:14,740
I would never do it to him.

2024
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:15,940
We're good pals.

2025
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,840
I would never lie, Sykuno.

2026
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:22,760
Oh, so we're gonna find out liar's deck if he'll ever lie to you, Sykuno.

2027
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,700
Well, I mean, in this game, we'd have to.

2028
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,340
Okay, we have to lie.

2029
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:29,840
Oh, so it's like, you know, you're not, like, willingly lying to each other.

2030
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,800
It's like a life or death thing, so basically, you're...

2031
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,680
We're literally put on gunpoint.

2032
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,260
Join the game, please.

2033
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,360
I can't.

2034
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:43,340
Yeah, because this... Oh, thank God.

2035
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,240
There he is.

2036
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,200
It would be funny if I actually changed his name.

2037
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:50,060
Oh, we should all be foxes.

2038
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:52,120
Oh, yeah.

2039
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,040
Yeah, yeah.

2040
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,240
All I'm saying is that...

2041
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,020
Let's lock it in.

2042
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,800
For women everywhere.

2043
01:10:58,520 --> 01:10:59,220
Lock it in.

2044
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:00,300
It's time, guys.

2045
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:01,220
Ready up, ready up.

2046
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:04,220
I don't know what's going on.

2047
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,900
Don't worry, you'll find out.

2048
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:06,740
You'll find out.

2049
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:08,800
Oh, we're playing dice first?

2050
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:09,200
Okay.

2051
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:10,700
There we go.

2052
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,920
So, basically...

2053
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:13,860
You go first.

2054
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,500
I think we did the same intro.

2055
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:18,880
That was so funny.

2056
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,840
Me and Donkey have some kind of...

2057
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,740
I read your mind.

2058
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:27,540
Remember, Cyclone, I can read you.

2059
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,680
Dude, she does read me.

2060
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:30,040
How?

2061
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,220
You have me tell.

2062
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:34,840
No, I don't.

2063
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,700
Wait, let's explain this to Ray.

2064
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:38,660
Okay, Elim, explain it to him.

2065
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:40,640
I feel like Elim will do the best job.

2066
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,020
So, basically...

2067
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,660
What you want to do is, Ray...

2068
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:46,220
You need to look at those dice.

2069
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:48,740
You want to basically guess...

2070
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:49,120
Can you see this?

2071
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:50,340
I can see you.

2072
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:54,580
I know you have one four low.

2073
01:11:54,800 --> 01:12:02,380
Right now, if you think collectively between us, there's going to be more than two sixes, then you don't want to call him on a lie.

2074
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:03,940
Wait, wait, wait.

2075
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:04,320
Explain that.

2076
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,440
So, basically, you're just guessing how many of each dice you think there are.

2077
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,580
They're all between us, essentially.

2078
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,340
Let's say you have a bunch of ones.

2079
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,160
You could say there's three ones.

2080
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,100
And if someone thinks you're lying, they'll call you out and try to make you lose.

2081
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,480
But it's everybody's dice.

2082
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:19,020
Wait, why is my heart beating faster?

2083
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:20,520
Because you have a time limit.

2084
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:21,360
There's a time limit.

2085
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:23,380
Three ones?

2086
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:25,320
There's three ones, bro.

2087
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:26,040
Don't call him out.

2088
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:26,860
There's no way there's three ones.

2089
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,680
There's got to be three ones, surely.

2090
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:31,360
And it has to go up one every time.

2091
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:33,260
Four fives.

2092
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:34,420
Four fives?

2093
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:37,740
I'm calling you a liar, dammit, Dokibot.

2094
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,080
I'm calling you a dang liar.

2095
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:39,920
Oh, no.

2096
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,960
Is it just for us?

2097
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,040
No, for everybody.

2098
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:47,500
Dude, LM, you had a five.

2099
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,400
No way!

2100
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:54,040
So, basically, you're just guessing or calling people out if you think they're wrong.

2101
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:55,180
Okay, okay, okay.

2102
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:56,300
I think I understand.

2103
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,520
The card is more fun, but this is better to learn how to play.

2104
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,700
I mean, guys, there's no way.

2105
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,780
Three threes, surely.

2106
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:06,720
Three threes.

2107
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,840
I have zero threes, by the way.

2108
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:11,440
How do I lie?

2109
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:13,600
Only Sykuno can call.

2110
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,220
I have zero threes, Sykuno.

2111
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:18,160
I have zero threes.

2112
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:19,820
Wait, how do we call him out?

2113
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:21,100
I can call him out.

2114
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,940
I think there's got to be three threes.

2115
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:25,780
There's no way four ones.

2116
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,020
You can call him out.

2117
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:29,500
He says four ones.

2118
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,420
I have zero ones, Ray.

2119
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:35,600
What's the five times W-S-E-X called liar?

2120
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:37,320
What?

2121
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:38,900
Oh, wait, wait, guys.

2122
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,000
I'm just learning how to press the buttons.

2123
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:40,620
Oh, yeah, those are the controls.

2124
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:45,480
So, if you think I'm wrong, you can just call it out.

2125
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:48,080
Ray, I have zero ones.

2126
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:48,800
He's a liar.

2127
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,080
I'm just letting you know right now.

2128
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:53,260
She has zero ones.

2129
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,380
She has zero threes.

2130
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:57,900
What do you say?

2131
01:13:58,820 --> 01:13:58,880
Four twos.

2132
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,020
No way.

2133
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:01,840
There's literally no shot.

2134
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:04,760
So, if you look around, your face looks around.

2135
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:05,380
Like, look at me.

2136
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:07,820
Dead in the eyes.

2137
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:10,280
You can look at each other.

2138
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,560
You think there's five fours?

2139
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,440
You're a damn liar.

2140
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:16,340
You're a dang liar.

2141
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:16,980
What?

2142
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:18,520
Three.

2143
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,020
Five.

2144
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:20,920
Oh, dude, Ellen.

2145
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,520
Dude, Ellen died to me.

2146
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,660
She died two times in a row.

2147
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:27,160
Ellen.

2148
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,320
Ellen.

2149
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:31,620
Goodbye, Ellen.

2150
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,380
Oh, my God.

2151
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,380
Oh, my God, he's actually dead.

2152
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,860
Don't worry, there's still three of us.

2153
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,640
From the quadruplets to the triplets.

2154
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:43,420
We're now triplets.

2155
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:46,640
There's definitely four ones out there at least, right?

2156
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,180
Yeah, there should be, right?

2157
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:49,480
I have zero ones, Ray.

2158
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:51,440
Are you crazy?

2159
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:52,880
He's crazy.

2160
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,840
I had one.

2161
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:56,600
Yes!

2162
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:59,940
Oh, thank God.

2163
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:01,180
Thank God.

2164
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,760
You still have one more life, Ray.

2165
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:04,600
You still have one more life.

2166
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:06,760
For the road.

2167
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:08,700
Oh, God.

2168
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,760
What do you have?

2169
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:12,920
Come on, Ray.

2170
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:16,820
You don't have to go, like...

2171
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:19,700
You can do one threes.

2172
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,960
You don't have to.

2173
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:22,140
Three ones?

2174
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,140
Dude, no way there's three ones there, right?

2175
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:27,720
No way, right?

2176
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:28,720
I don't lie.

2177
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,160
Don't lie, guys.

2178
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,400
Cool him out.

2179
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,680
Cool his ass out.

2180
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:36,660
From the dead.

2181
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:39,620
Three fives.

2182
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:41,780
Three fives.

2183
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:42,580
And I don't have a five.

2184
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,020
Four ones.

2185
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:46,480
There's no way there's four ones.

2186
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:47,560
I don't know.

2187
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:48,680
There's no way.

2188
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,900
I don't have any ones.

2189
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,340
Wait, I have no ones, too.

2190
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:52,960
Wait, call him out.

2191
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:54,020
Actually, don't.

2192
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:54,900
For real this time.

2193
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:57,440
Wait, can I...

2194
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:01,380
Surely there's four ones out there.

2195
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:01,800
Do it.

2196
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:02,060
Do it.

2197
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,300
Get him, Ray.

2198
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,180
Get him, Ray.

2199
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:08,800
Four twos?

2200
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,200
Four twos?

2201
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,020
There's no way.

2202
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:17,520
There's no way there's four twos.

2203
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,840
There's no way there's four twos.

2204
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,340
There's no way.

2205
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,380
Cool him out.

2206
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:25,720
I have one life.

2207
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:26,180
Here we go.

2208
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:27,940
I got one.

2209
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:29,840
There's...

2210
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,260
Oh my god.

2211
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,240
It's a 1v1.

2212
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:38,640
We haven't lost a life yet.

2213
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,100
This is it.

2214
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:42,840
I'm LMBOB right now.

2215
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,600
Welcome, brethren.

2216
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,060
Welcome, brethren, to the dead zone.

2217
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:49,140
Okay, two ones.

2218
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:49,800
Okay.

2219
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:54,720
I'm pretty sure you have another three.

2220
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,540
Two threes.

2221
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:00,180
Oh, I don't.

2222
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,600
Unless you jebaited me.

2223
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:03,540
What?

2224
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:06,080
Wait, you actually said...

2225
01:17:06,570 --> 01:17:07,780
What the heck?

2226
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,360
Wait, dude, why are you good at this game?

2227
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,120
We just started.

2228
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,080
She's mind gaming.

2229
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,160
She's actually mind gaming.

2230
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,440
It's been like two minutes.

2231
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,500
That's insane.

2232
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:21,940
That's actually insane.

2233
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,720
I can't believe you got baited there.

2234
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,680
Dude, she planned it out.

2235
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:28,920
She planned it out.

2236
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,180
Oh my god.

2237
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,420
Wait, I could have called two sixes?

2238
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:37,060
I don't think I can do two of something.

2239
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,120
Yeah, you can't go down yet.

2240
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,140
Yeah, yeah.

2241
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,100
Because otherwise the game could just last forever.

2242
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:45,020
You could just keep calling one of whatever you have.

2243
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,180
Two fives.

2244
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:48,280
You have one.

2245
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,300
It's a bold move.

2246
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,380
Three ones.

2247
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:54,780
I know you have one.

2248
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:57,920
This has got a few tricks up its sleeve.

2249
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,120
What are you thinking here, Dokie?

2250
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:00,540
What are you thinking?

2251
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:03,260
I think...

2252
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,120
Three threes.

2253
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,180
Three threes?

2254
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,240
Nah, there's no way.

2255
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,180
Oh my god.

2256
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:14,680
Dude, no way.

2257
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:18,120
Goodbye, Sykkuno.

2258
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,120
Just like that.

2259
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:21,240
Oh my god.

2260
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,280
Goodbye.

2261
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:26,000
I didn't even lose a call.

2262
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,060
Actually, big brain.

2263
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:28,980
Jesus Christ, he's crazy.

2264
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:32,760
He was the one that stopped me.

2265
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,000
He's keeping her down, bro.

2266
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,400
I'm playing to my hands.

2267
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:39,080
That's right.

2268
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:41,940
The card one is like Russian Roulette.

2269
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,280
So we'll do the card one now.

2270
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,300
Yeah, the card one is more fun.

2271
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,340
How did we do the card one?

2272
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,560
It's a similar kind of vibe.

2273
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,460
Guys, I don't know if I want to be called the best liar.

2274
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,260
Here we go.

2275
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,800
I love this game.

2276
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:01,000
What?

2277
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,580
Oh wait, which part?

2278
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:05,780
Have you ever played this?

2279
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,500
Like in Minecraft, right?

2280
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,000
In Minecraft, right?

2281
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:14,580
I played it with an airsoft gun.

2282
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,200
You played this with an airsoft gun?

2283
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:17,920
Oh my god.

2284
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:18,760
Doesn't that hurt?

2285
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,640
Did you have your helmet on?

2286
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:25,400
In the top left, it's telling you what card to play.

2287
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:27,940
In the top left.

2288
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:31,240
And you get to choose how many of those you play.

2289
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:32,540
Or you can play fake ones.

2290
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:33,280
And hope they don't come.

2291
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:35,840
Wait, how do I play it now?

2292
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,980
I will risk it for you.

2293
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,000
So he could be like, I could put a fake one right now.

2294
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:42,740
And it is fake.

2295
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:43,940
How the heck?

2296
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,140
He's so good.

2297
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,620
He's got Google Chrome open.

2298
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:51,620
I swear he does.

2299
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:53,100
Is this gory?

2300
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:56,100
He's got a damn Google Chrome tab of me.

2301
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:57,880
That doesn't make sense.

2302
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:02,800
I downloaded you, Sakura.

2303
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:06,480
He's got a damn Google Chrome tab open.

2304
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:08,040
Man, appeal the explanation.

2305
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:09,460
Okay, here we go.

2306
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,160
So Joker counts as any card.

2307
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:13,820
Other than that, you're trying to play the top left.

2308
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:14,420
Yeah.

2309
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:17,960
Why are you trying to play the top left?

2310
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:19,900
We have three kings.

2311
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,840
That's funny, because I also have three kings.

2312
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:27,040
So basically, Ray, you could play...

2313
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,320
Wait, how do I call bullshit on that?

2314
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,000
You just push X.

2315
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:32,320
So how many of each card is there?

2316
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:33,980
There's eight.

2317
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,600
Two Jokers and six of each.

2318
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:41,300
But Ray, people could like, for example, I could play like a queen, and I would say a king.

2319
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:48,220
So right now, Sakura and I both play five kings.

2320
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:50,440
So push space bar to select the cards you want to play.

2321
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,240
You like tab in between them, basically.

2322
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,360
You push E to play.

2323
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:54,960
Two kings.

2324
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,320
So now there's one king left.

2325
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:01,960
We could be nice to him, but we gotta teach him the hard way.

2326
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,260
Enjoy bullets, Ray.

2327
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,880
Enjoy these bullets.

2328
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:08,740
We could be nice, but we gotta teach him the hard way.

2329
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:10,380
He might even die right now.

2330
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,960
So you have a one in six chance to die.

2331
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,300
It'd be so unlucky if he died.

2332
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:15,940
I mean, he's already had that experience.

2333
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:18,680
He has the Russian roulette experience already.

2334
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,080
He just needs to figure out the cards.

2335
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:20,500
Yeah.

2336
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,600
This one's like an actual...

2337
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,160
You know how the back one's kind of weird?

2338
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:26,700
Always?

2339
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:32,520
You see on the top left what cards you put down.

2340
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:35,240
And you want to get rid of your cards, right?

2341
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:35,660
Yeah.

2342
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,120
If you get rid of all your cards, I think you win.

2343
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,720
But it's pretty unlikely.

2344
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:42,620
Because like...

2345
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:45,220
There's just no way you have all five of the cards you need.

2346
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,340
Theoretically, it is possible, though.

2347
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:50,680
It's basically like how safe you want to play it, right?

2348
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:51,180
Yeah, yeah.

2349
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:53,420
Whoever loses the last round goes first.

2350
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:54,020
Yeah, yeah.

2351
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:57,580
Well, you don't want to say you only have two.

2352
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:58,840
Yeah, you don't want...

2353
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2354
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,260
Because I know you're lying because I have two.

2355
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:03,900
Wait.

2356
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,680
Wait, you have two.

2357
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,000
But I have two.

2358
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,560
Wait, you have two?

2359
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:10,840
Then why are you only playing one?

2360
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,960
I only have one.

2361
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:15,540
I only have one queen.

2362
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:16,360
That's a lie.

2363
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:18,140
I only have one queen.

2364
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:20,900
So I'll put down two.

2365
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:21,900
She's lying.

2366
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:25,040
Ray, call her out.

2367
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:27,320
What if I don't have any more?

2368
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:28,220
I don't know what to do.

2369
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,520
You can either call me out for lying...

2370
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:35,060
or LM will call you out for lying.

2371
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:36,640
Wait, I don't have any more.

2372
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:39,420
Well, well, well, Sycuna.

2373
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:41,780
Wait, he didn't call me out.

2374
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:42,580
So I'm good?

2375
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:45,200
Yeah, yeah, no one called you out.

2376
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:46,880
LM technically still could, right?

2377
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:47,760
I still could.

2378
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:52,880
Or I could let you live and play one more card, Sycuna.

2379
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:53,340
Is that a lie?

2380
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:55,040
Is that a damn lie, brother?

2381
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:56,320
Oh, jesus shit.

2382
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:56,740
It wasn't.

2383
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:57,900
No!

2384
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:02,200
Ray, LM killed me, man.

2385
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:03,280
LM killed me.

2386
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,180
What happened, Sycuna?

2387
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,720
It's been downhill.

2388
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:10,360
Oh my god, I live.

2389
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,440
Oh, thank god.

2390
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:13,240
Thank god.

2391
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:16,720
Queens again.

2392
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,020
Okay, okay.

2393
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:20,180
You're losing your touch right now.

2394
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,760
You're getting it way too in your head, Sycuna.

2395
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:25,480
What is this?

2396
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:25,860
Queens?

2397
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:28,800
Okay, okay.

2398
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:29,180
Two?

2399
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:30,760
That's impossible.

2400
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:31,900
Because I have four.

2401
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:32,700
Really?

2402
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:33,860
I have none.

2403
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:36,040
If you had four, that would still make it possible.

2404
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:37,100
I actually have none.

2405
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,120
Cool her out.

2406
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:40,900
Cool her out, Ray.

2407
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:41,260
Quick.

2408
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,360
Dude, don't call out on a one.

2409
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,080
That's crazy.

2410
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:44,480
Cool her out, man.

2411
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:45,460
Cool her out quick.

2412
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:49,280
I guess he's scared of calling me out now.

2413
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:49,520
No idea, Ray.

2414
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:50,840
Cool her out.

2415
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,360
No way, on a one?

2416
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,820
No way, on a one?

2417
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:56,660
You're crazy.

2418
01:23:58,020 --> 01:23:58,460
Yes.

2419
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,300
Enjoy the sweet sensation of death, Ray.

2420
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,120
Look into our eyes.

2421
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,340
Look into our eyes.

2422
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,600
Oh my god, dude.

2423
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,200
He died.

2424
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,720
This is your fault.

2425
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,120
This is your fault.

2426
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:14,980
You did this.

2427
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,440
That's for killing me in RP, fuck.

2428
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:18,040
Goddamn.

2429
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,380
I thought things happened in RP.

2430
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:21,540
Dude, I remember.

2431
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:24,340
Enjoy it.

2432
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,660
That's for Jeeves Bingleton, you dick.

2433
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:29,360
Enjoy that.

2434
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:30,820
Enjoy that.

2435
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:32,760
Oh, man.

2436
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:33,940
Yes.

2437
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:36,340
Alright, me too.

2438
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,640
Let's just keep doing that all the time.

2439
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:41,200
Oh, I guess I'll just play this queen then.

2440
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:41,780
Me too.

2441
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:44,760
Dude, that sounded like he didn't play a queen, I'll be honest.

2442
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:45,960
It's a queen.

2443
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:48,220
You know what happened?

2444
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:51,540
It sounded so much like it wasn't a queen.

2445
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:52,940
Enjoy the bullets.

2446
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:54,940
It just sounded so much like it wasn't a queen.

2447
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,560
Enjoy the bullets, brother.

2448
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,260
One in five is crazy.

2449
01:24:58,860 --> 01:24:59,860
I'm alive, Ben.

2450
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:00,420
I'm alive.

2451
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:01,240
He's alive.

2452
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:03,540
Elim hasn't got a shot once.

2453
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:06,060
Oh, this is my game to win, guys.

2454
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,140
Elim's not even calling.

2455
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:08,780
Oh, is it?

2456
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,840
This is fine.

2457
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,580
Oh, yeah, by the way, Elim has not won a single game yet, Ray.

2458
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:15,100
Oh, that makes sense.

2459
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:19,820
You keep laying that dead, alright?

2460
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:20,820
That's true, actually.

2461
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:22,320
Oh, shit, you have three as well?

2462
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:23,800
Me too.

2463
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,440
Oh, dude, Elim, she doesn't have three.

2464
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:28,060
I know you're a liar.

2465
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:29,160
I know you're a liar.

2466
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:30,300
It's GG.

2467
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:32,940
Oh, the joker.

2468
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:33,900
The joker.

2469
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:37,740
You didn't have three either, right?

2470
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,400
I'm looking up.

2471
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:39,000
I can't look.

2472
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:41,580
He's dead.

2473
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:41,980
He's dead.

2474
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:44,840
Elim might win this one.

2475
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:47,420
Wait, Saikuro, did you have the three as well?

2476
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:48,840
No, those were legit three.

2477
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,120
Oh, yeah, they were legit three?

2478
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:51,720
Here we go.

2479
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,220
I'm mixing it up now.

2480
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,720
You're mixing it up?

2481
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:58,820
Oh, God.

2482
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,940
I guess I'll just play these two kings then.

2483
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:02,840
Alright.

2484
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:05,600
I guess I'll just play these two kings then.

2485
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:09,240
Yeah, well, I guess I'll just play these two kings as well.

2486
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:09,880
That makes sense.

2487
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,700
I mean, I guess I'll just play these two kings then.

2488
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:14,780
He only played one king.

2489
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:15,260
He lied.

2490
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:18,120
Dude, no way.

2491
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:19,540
No way.

2492
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:21,460
I'm dead.

2493
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:22,220
I'm dead.

2494
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:23,860
Elim's gonna win.

2495
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:25,640
Yes, enjoy the bullets.

2496
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:27,420
Enjoy the bullets, brother.

2497
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:29,640
Enjoy the bullets.

2498
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:32,160
You have to stop his reign of terror.

2499
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,340
Enjoy the bullets.

2500
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:35,640
Dude, I kept challenging him.

2501
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:37,200
It sounds so sad.

2502
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,620
I'm doing this for women everywhere.

2503
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:42,220
I'm doing this for women everywhere.

2504
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,560
Why did you keep challenging?

2505
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,760
I have one king as well.

2506
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:48,300
I have one king as well.

2507
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:50,280
Oh, well, luckily for me, I've got three.

2508
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,740
Oh, well, luckily for me, I've got three.

2509
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:53,560
Oh, my God.

2510
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:55,600
Three kings right there.

2511
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:56,940
I have...

2512
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,300
He's gonna play three kings and he's gonna lie on his next one, right?

2513
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:02,420
Or is he?

2514
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:04,060
Dude, I think he's already lying.

2515
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:04,820
Who knows?

2516
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,000
I'm gonna see.

2517
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:09,760
Oh, Doki, that's your show.

2518
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,540
That's your show, Doki.

2519
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:13,780
Three right there.

2520
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:14,660
Enjoy that.

2521
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,200
Enjoy it.

2522
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:16,220
Enjoy it.

2523
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:17,820
Oh, please, not a one pump.

2524
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:18,960
Please, not a one pump.

2525
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:19,520
No, please!

2526
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:23,640
Not a one pump!

2527
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,220
Let me have my win, Dana.

2528
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,520
Let me have my win, please.

2529
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:28,860
He's locked in.

2530
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:32,180
A win for Elim is a win for women.

2531
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:34,620
He's locked in right now.

2532
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:35,200
That's what they say.

2533
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:36,780
Here we go.

2534
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,540
I guess I'll put two kings.

2535
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:45,580
I guess I'll play two kings, then.

2536
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:49,720
I guess if you're gonna put two kings, I'm gonna put one king.

2537
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,400
I guess I'll play one king, then.

2538
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:54,560
And then, I guess...

2539
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,880
I'll play one king, too.

2540
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,660
I guess I'll, uh...

2541
01:27:58,660 --> 01:27:59,780
play one king, then.

2542
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,200
Alright, I guess I'll call you a liar.

2543
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:04,580
No, it's the truth.

2544
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:05,780
Are you serious?

2545
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:06,940
What are his cards?

2546
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:09,040
What are his cards?

2547
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,360
I had no more kings!

2548
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,660
Yes, please.

2549
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:14,520
Let me have my win, please.

2550
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,280
This has to be it.

2551
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:16,980
How?

2552
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:21,820
All you have to do is beat him in one round, and he'll lose because it's Elim.

2553
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,640
Elim has terrible luck.

2554
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:25,180
You don't understand.

2555
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,000
Just beat him in one round.

2556
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:26,940
I've got this.

2557
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:27,620
Watch this.

2558
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:28,280
Yeah?

2559
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:29,860
Oh.

2560
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:35,060
What do you got there, dokey bird?

2561
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:35,680
C.

2562
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:37,480
What do you got there?

2563
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:39,360
C...

2564
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:41,560
I guess I'll put one queen, then.

2565
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:45,120
I guess I'll just play two queens, then.

2566
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,320
I guess I'll call you a liar.

2567
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,980
There's no way.

2568
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:51,080
There's no way!

2569
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:52,420
How does he have all the cards?

2570
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,940
I had zero cards!

2571
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:55,640
You're crazy.

2572
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:56,760
You're crazy.

2573
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,900
I can't read him anymore.

2574
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:00,800
I can't read him!

2575
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,420
I can't read him!

2576
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:04,540
I can't!

2577
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:07,360
I only can read Ray and Saikudo.

2578
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:07,960
I can't!

2579
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,340
I can't!

2580
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:13,240
I don't know his...

2581
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:14,920
I don't know his tail anymore.

2582
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,940
Chilled was the one that...

2583
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:18,980
Chilled could read Elim.

2584
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:19,900
I couldn't.

2585
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:21,820
He's lying.

2586
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:22,620
He's...

2587
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:23,660
Saikudo, I swear to God.

2588
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:25,420
I don't know.

2589
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:27,000
He only played one, man.

2590
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:27,940
I know.

2591
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:28,700
That's the thing.

2592
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:30,840
It's so hard to tell.

2593
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:31,700
I can't tell.

2594
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:33,740
He has so many cards.

2595
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:34,520
It's so hard to tell.

2596
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:35,880
I guess I'll just play this queen, then.

2597
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:37,760
It's so difficult.

2598
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:39,300
He has so many cards.

2599
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:40,680
Oh, God.

2600
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:41,260
Oh, God.

2601
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,000
I like this.

2602
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,540
Oh, my God.

2603
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,600
What are you thinking there, Doki?

2604
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:48,500
What are you thinking?

2605
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,340
I'm trying to figure it out right now.

2606
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:53,480
What are you thinking there, man?

2607
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:55,880
I'm trying to figure this out.

2608
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:56,440
Liar.

2609
01:29:57,140 --> 01:29:57,540
Liar.

2610
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:58,180
Oh, thank God.

2611
01:29:58,570 --> 01:29:59,740
Oh, thank God.

2612
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,120
This could be it.

2613
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,060
This could be the end.

2614
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,880
Come on, please.

2615
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:07,580
Come on.

2616
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,400
This could be it.

2617
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:10,780
I'll join Hades.

2618
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:11,760
He's lying.

2619
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:14,080
You'll join Hades?

2620
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:15,000
He's lying.

2621
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:17,480
You can't just join.

2622
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:20,840
There's two gang leaders here.

2623
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,420
Oh, my God.

2624
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:23,460
Oh, my God.

2625
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:27,680
Hmm.

2626
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:28,260
Dude, how many...

2627
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:29,740
It's not showing me how many bullets...

2628
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:31,620
I'll play these three kings, then, I guess.

2629
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:32,440
Oh, he's two on it.

2630
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:36,100
I mean, if you're gonna place three...

2631
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,740
I guess I'll place one.

2632
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:42,160
I guess I'll place one.

2633
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:42,700
One king.

2634
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:43,760
Okay.

2635
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:45,180
I can't read.

2636
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:47,760
I'll just play these two kings, then.

2637
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:48,980
Do the 1v1 at the end.

2638
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:49,900
Wait, what?

2639
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:50,740
He's lying.

2640
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:52,640
He's laughing.

2641
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,560
It forces you to call a lie.

2642
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:56,700
I didn't press anything.

2643
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:59,820
It forces you to call a lie.

2644
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:00,580
Yes.

2645
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,280
Oh, my God.

2646
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:04,760
She's dead.

2647
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:06,500
She's alive.

2648
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:09,740
This is crazy.

2649
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:13,140
It forces you to call a lie if he has no more cards.

2650
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:14,980
There's no way.

2651
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:16,460
Oh, yeah.

2652
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:18,240
If he plays all his cards, it forces you to call a lie.

2653
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,160
Yeah, there's nothing you can do.

2654
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:24,660
If he tricks you early in the round and only has a good card, then...

2655
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:25,100
That's crazy.

2656
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:27,540
Do the 1v1 at the end.

2657
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:28,300
That's so stupid.

2658
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:31,060
Play this one king, then.

2659
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:32,920
I guess I'll...

2660
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:34,700
I'll play this one king, as well.

2661
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:35,840
One king.

2662
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:39,360
I guess I'll just play these two kings, then.

2663
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:44,380
I can't.

2664
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:45,460
I have no more.

2665
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:46,580
I have no more.

2666
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:49,340
I have no more cards.

2667
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:50,240
I have no more.

2668
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:52,760
Oh, my God.

2669
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,860
If Doki wins this, it would just be insane.

2670
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:56,140
It would just be insane.

2671
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,740
I mean, it's a 50-50.

2672
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:00,860
Everyone's first win.

2673
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,060
I can't believe it.

2674
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:02,920
No way.

2675
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:05,780
Look at him.

2676
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:06,500
Let's go, baby.

2677
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:08,640
I don't know.

2678
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:09,800
I want to play that one more time.

2679
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,220
Or should we stop?

2680
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:13,100
We're going.

2681
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:15,580
I can't believe it.

2682
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:17,380
LM got his first win.

2683
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,680
I know how to play now.

2684
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:21,960
LM took advantage of the fact that I didn't know how to play.

2685
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:23,260
He read me.

2686
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:28,360
I also had another two kings.

2687
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:30,640
I had another two kings ready to go.

2688
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:33,260
No, I had the shittiest cards throughout it.

2689
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:35,320
I only had one or two of the cards.

2690
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,000
It was so bad for me.

2691
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,920
It's crazy.

2692
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,500
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2693
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:44,200
Whoever's tier...

2694
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:47,400
It's the same order always.

2695
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:49,440
Oh, no, it's not actually.

2696
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:50,520
Ray's on the other side now.

2697
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,120
Now, LM calls out Doki.

2698
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:56,460
Oh, hello there, Doki bud.

2699
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:57,820
You don't call.

2700
01:32:57,860 --> 01:32:58,780
You don't call, guys.

2701
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:01,860
You wait until somebody else calls you.

2702
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:02,720
I'm ready.

2703
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:05,060
I'm ready this time.

2704
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,140
Yeah, are you sure?

2705
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:09,100
Oh, yeah.

2706
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,460
Lock it in, brother.

2707
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:13,780
What do you reckon?

2708
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:14,860
Two kings.

2709
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,020
Two kings, okay.

2710
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:18,760
Interesting.

2711
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:21,260
Interesting.

2712
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,520
I also have two kings.

2713
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:26,680
That's interesting because I also have two kings.

2714
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:28,820
Call him a liar, Ray.

2715
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,220
There aren't that many kings.

2716
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:33,760
You want an early grave, Ray?

2717
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,000
There aren't that many kings.

2718
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Ray,

2719
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:38,680
trust me.

2720
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,740
He always lies on his first one.

2721
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:43,140
He always lies on his first one.

2722
01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:44,400
No, no, no, no.

2723
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,560
Three kings.

2724
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:47,760
Three kings.

2725
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:48,820
That's a lie.

2726
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:51,600
Dude, it's obviously the truth.

2727
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:52,080
That's a lie.

2728
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:54,300
Doki can tell it's true.

2729
01:33:54,860 --> 01:33:55,860
It's a lie, dammit.

2730
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,700
I know it's a lie.

2731
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:00,280
Here's the thing.

2732
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:01,660
Look at me.

2733
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:03,800
Saekuno, I want you...

2734
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:07,820
Saekuno, I'm gonna pass the torch to you to fight Ellum.

2735
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:10,180
I'm gonna pass the torch to you to fight Ellum.

2736
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:10,760
What does that mean?

2737
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:11,380
What are you saying?

2738
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:12,900
That's a lie.

2739
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:15,060
Doki just lied.

2740
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,900
Well, luckily for me, I'll play these two kings then, I guess.

2741
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,100
Would that be a lie, Ray?

2742
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:28,040
Ray, that's a lie.

2743
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:29,660
You should not have a king left.

2744
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:32,140
I'm gonna no-booze you right now, Ray.

2745
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:32,720
Call me a liar.

2746
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:36,300
Oh my god.

2747
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:48,920
Enjoy the bullets, Ray.

2748
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:49,560
What do you mean I win?

2749
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:52,340
I want this to be a Saekuno vs.

2750
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:53,420
Ellum matchup.

2751
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:58,760
You're crazed for that.

2752
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,060
Here we go.

2753
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:07,900
King's table.

2754
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:09,620
Okay, okay.

2755
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:11,620
I got some kings.

2756
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,480
Yeah, you got some in there.

2757
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:19,920
What are you gonna do, PTSD?

2758
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:22,080
Dude, he sounds like he doesn't have kings.

2759
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:25,900
He sounds so much like he doesn't have kings.

2760
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:27,040
Ray, you got a few kings in there?

2761
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,740
Why are you taking so long to think about your cards, Ray?

2762
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:31,740
It's literally...

2763
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:33,180
I don't think he has a king.

2764
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,260
I don't think he has one.

2765
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:36,900
That was all a debate.

2766
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:38,840
Just to freak us out.

2767
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:40,380
I may have fallen for it.

2768
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:42,900
You might have fallen for it?

2769
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:46,080
Dude, I think it was all a debate.

2770
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:47,860
I guess we all can just play...

2771
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:49,000
keep playing one king, right?

2772
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,520
We'll just play our one king then, right guys?

2773
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,920
Yeah, if we keep playing one king, then we'll win.

2774
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:54,240
Lock it in.

2775
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:58,120
Uh-huh.

2776
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:00,100
Dude, he seems so stressed out.

2777
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:02,200
Yeah, Ray, why do you sound so scared?

2778
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:03,220
What's going on, man?

2779
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:06,180
You sound like you're freaking out every time.

2780
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:07,760
I ain't calling it.

2781
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:10,660
Yeah, he wants to do something.

2782
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,720
So I'm gonna put my one king in here.

2783
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:14,420
Yeah, I'll just put my one king in.

2784
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:16,460
The weird thing is, we've played like 10 kings at this point.

2785
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:19,000
Yeah, something is wrong.

2786
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:20,580
The map's not adding up.

2787
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,960
That's a big-ass pile.

2788
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:25,740
Two kings?!

2789
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:27,400
Damn, that's a lot of kings.

2790
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:28,360
He was so confident that time.

2791
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:31,740
He has one more card, so you are forced to call out a lie.

2792
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:33,140
By the way, Sykkuno.

2793
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:36,100
Because I definitely have one king left.

2794
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:39,220
The thing is, guys, luckily for me, I've got three kings.

2795
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:39,900
I'll be playing them all.

2796
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:40,360
Thank you so much.

2797
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,140
Oh, that's such an obvious thing.

2798
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:42,740
Thank you so much.

2799
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,400
No, he definitely had three kings.

2800
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,340
Do I have to call a lie?

2801
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,440
You have to, but he has to.

2802
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:51,700
Unless we had all three kings for real.

2803
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:54,180
He always keeps at least one of the cards.

2804
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:55,160
What happens if I play my card?

2805
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,720
I don't think you can.

2806
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:57,500
I mean, you can try.

2807
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:00,420
That's a real shame.

2808
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:00,900
Enjoy the taste of bullets.

2809
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:04,400
I've realized he always keeps at least one of the cards.

2810
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:05,640
Wait, he actually had all three?

2811
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:08,140
No, he's been doing that for the 1v1.

2812
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:09,100
I noticed it.

2813
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:10,780
Enjoy the taste of bullets.

2814
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:12,380
Dude, we know his tells now.

2815
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:15,200
How is he still alive?

2816
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:16,300
This fucker should be dead.

2817
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,360
That's crazy.

2818
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:19,460
I'll remember that.

2819
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,240
I'll remember that RP.

2820
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,600
Come back, I hope you do.

2821
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:24,240
We gotta ocean dump him again.

2822
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:26,220
No, please, please.

2823
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:29,000
We gotta ocean dump him again.

2824
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:29,340
No.

2825
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,180
Wait, do I claim what card it is?

2826
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,940
No, no, it's a king.

2827
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:36,140
It's a king, yeah.

2828
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:36,940
So, top left.

2829
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:41,940
Here we go.

2830
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:43,740
I'm waiting, Ray.

2831
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:46,480
I'm waiting.

2832
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:47,680
One king.

2833
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:49,360
That's a lie.

2834
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:52,420
It's a lie, damn it.

2835
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:53,940
Dude, there's no way he lied first.

2836
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,100
I know he's lying, I can tell.

2837
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:57,980
Yeah, no way he lies first.

2838
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,600
Yeah, he's still learning the game.

2839
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:00,800
Three kings.

2840
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:02,700
Cut him out, Ray.

2841
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:05,160
Cut him out, Ray.

2842
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:06,900
Dude, there's no way he had three kings.

2843
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:09,540
You don't lie, Ray, on the first turn.

2844
01:38:09,940 --> 01:38:10,940
He's lying, dude.

2845
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:11,360
He's lying.

2846
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:13,480
He's gotta be lying.

2847
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:15,820
You think he's just got three kings like that?

2848
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:17,160
It's not a lie, Ray.

2849
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:20,080
He's been having some really good cards, though, Saekun.

2850
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:22,460
He's been having some really good cards.

2851
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:24,980
No way he's just got three kings like that, right?

2852
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:26,480
Believe in me, Ray.

2853
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:27,440
Yes.

2854
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:28,200
No way.

2855
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:28,760
Yes.

2856
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:32,120
Alright.

2857
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,040
One king.

2858
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:36,800
Liar.

2859
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:38,160
Okay.

2860
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:39,660
No.

2861
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:41,380
No.

2862
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:41,480
No.

2863
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:45,820
I feel like calling it one is just always really scary.

2864
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:47,360
Let me look directly in the hole.

2865
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:48,920
Take me out.

2866
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:49,760
I dare you.

2867
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:51,340
Yes.

2868
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:52,400
I knew it.

2869
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:53,300
Alright.

2870
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:55,360
Oh, yeah.

2871
01:38:56,220 --> 01:38:57,700
We are up.

2872
01:38:58,780 --> 01:38:59,260
Alright.

2873
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:03,400
Here we go.

2874
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,260
Oh, that's a lot of kings I have here.

2875
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:10,540
Let me place these three kings.

2876
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:12,480
Ray, come on.

2877
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:13,000
Do it.

2878
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:14,240
Ray, you've got to do this.

2879
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:16,620
He's for sure lying, bro.

2880
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:17,620
Three kings?

2881
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:19,200
Nah, man.

2882
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:19,820
No way.

2883
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:22,960
Do you really think there's so many kings in that?

2884
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:24,980
Ray, you have so many.

2885
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:28,580
I bet you the last bullet is going to be on the sixth one.

2886
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:30,140
Trust me.

2887
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:31,780
Enjoy the bullets, Ray.

2888
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:32,340
Trust me.

2889
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:34,980
Ray, there's no way he's got three kings like that.

2890
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:39,600
Oh, he's going to play it safe.

2891
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:40,520
I can't believe it.

2892
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:44,400
Well, I guess I'll play this one king then.

2893
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,120
Yeah, me too.

2894
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:45,620
Dude, he's lying.

2895
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:48,580
He has a king there.

2896
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:52,380
I'm pretty sure your last card is a king, right?

2897
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:54,220
Is it a king?

2898
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:56,040
Oh, your last card is an ace?

2899
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:57,360
No way.

2900
01:39:58,740 --> 01:39:59,620
He's swapping.

2901
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:01,160
He's mixing it up.

2902
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:02,580
Surely he's...

2903
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:07,820
There's no way he's still alive, dude.

2904
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:08,560
Bro.

2905
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:09,540
Yo, Ray.

2906
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:11,700
Bro, he's in your head, Ray.

2907
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:12,860
He's in your head.

2908
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:15,860
This is insane.

2909
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:18,220
I don't even think he's thinking anymore.

2910
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,960
He's just going with the flow.

2911
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:22,300
Oh, man.

2912
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,200
Two aces.

2913
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:25,500
Two aces?

2914
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:26,860
Holy shit.

2915
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,500
I got three aces.

2916
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:31,540
You're going to grab three aces?

2917
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:36,380
I'm going to take your three aces and I'm also going to put three aces.

2918
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:37,200
What?

2919
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,860
You can't let her get away with that.

2920
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:41,220
I played three aces for real.

2921
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:43,100
I actually did play three aces, by the way.

2922
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,540
There can't be that many aces, dude.

2923
01:40:45,180 --> 01:40:45,860
It's a lie.

2924
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:48,280
Wait, what?

2925
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:50,700
How are there that many?

2926
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:53,920
I had two jokers.

2927
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:56,080
I had two jokers.

2928
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:56,940
I don't die here.

2929
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:57,980
Thank you, Sakuno.

2930
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:01,400
I knew I was fine.

2931
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:02,960
The jokers really did that.

2932
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:03,260
Yes.

2933
01:41:08,910 --> 01:41:10,030
All right.

2934
01:41:10,510 --> 01:41:10,850
Here we go.

2935
01:41:11,090 --> 01:41:11,870
Here we go.

2936
01:41:14,510 --> 01:41:15,990
Another two jokers.

2937
01:41:16,030 --> 01:41:17,970
I guess I'll play these three kings, then.

2938
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:21,570
Ray?

2939
01:41:21,890 --> 01:41:22,950
Ray is just...

2940
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:25,130
He's just in his head right now.

2941
01:41:25,270 --> 01:41:26,130
He doesn't know.

2942
01:41:27,290 --> 01:41:28,390
Ray is just...

2943
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:29,630
He's stuck.

2944
01:41:29,670 --> 01:41:30,490
I'm playing safe.

2945
01:41:31,690 --> 01:41:33,790
Surely, he doesn't have three kings.

2946
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:37,390
Enjoy the bullets, Ray.

2947
01:41:37,650 --> 01:41:38,870
Enjoy the bullets.

2948
01:41:39,930 --> 01:41:43,530
If you're going to let him get away with that, then I'm going to get away with this, too.

2949
01:41:44,670 --> 01:41:45,470
I mean, it's a one.

2950
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:46,850
I guess I'll just play as one king, then.

2951
01:41:51,070 --> 01:41:53,910
Ray, no matter what, he has that last card.

2952
01:41:54,690 --> 01:41:56,350
And you're going to have to call him out as a liar.

2953
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:57,770
He always saves the good card.

2954
01:41:57,870 --> 01:41:58,430
He does.

2955
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:00,630
He always saves it, man.

2956
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:02,650
Now would be the time.

2957
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:04,830
Two kings.

2958
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:06,510
Oh, two kings.

2959
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:08,190
Okay, okay, okay.

2960
01:42:08,370 --> 01:42:09,950
That's weird, because I have two kings.

2961
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:13,230
That's weird, because I also have two kings.

2962
01:42:14,150 --> 01:42:16,250
That's weird, because I also have two kings.

2963
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:18,210
That's a king.

2964
01:42:18,610 --> 01:42:18,750
He's lying.

2965
01:42:19,010 --> 01:42:19,690
He cast that.

2966
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:20,490
That's a king.

2967
01:42:20,610 --> 01:42:21,550
And there's no more.

2968
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:23,210
Enjoy the bullets.

2969
01:42:23,550 --> 01:42:27,290
The guy says, enjoy the bullets.

2970
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:29,030
He's talking about himself.

2971
01:42:29,130 --> 01:42:30,210
He's talking about himself.

2972
01:42:31,970 --> 01:42:32,810
I'm alive.

2973
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:34,010
I'm bulletproof.

2974
01:42:34,410 --> 01:42:36,730
He lives three out of six.

2975
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:40,150
Ace time.

2976
01:42:41,930 --> 01:42:42,890
Yes, yes.

2977
01:42:43,790 --> 01:42:46,650
All I'm saying is that Ray just plays and doesn't call lies.

2978
01:42:46,890 --> 01:42:48,510
He's playing it very safe.

2979
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:53,070
Well, luckily, I got these three aces right here.

2980
01:42:54,370 --> 01:42:56,990
Dude, Ray, you can't let him keep getting away with it, man.

2981
01:42:57,010 --> 01:42:57,850
He's going to fall for it.

2982
01:42:57,850 --> 01:43:00,530
I have these three aces right here.

2983
01:43:00,530 --> 01:43:01,670
He's going to fall for it.

2984
01:43:01,670 --> 01:43:03,070
Enjoy the bullets, Ray.

2985
01:43:03,570 --> 01:43:04,390
Enjoy them.

2986
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:06,350
Enjoy the bullets.

2987
01:43:06,610 --> 01:43:07,750
Okay, Ray.

2988
01:43:08,170 --> 01:43:10,350
Oh my god.

2989
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:12,230
Yes!

2990
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:15,370
Yes, you finally caught him on it, dude.

2991
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:19,130
Ray, I just wanted you to know I had five aces.

2992
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:21,490
I had five aces in my hand.

2993
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:21,950
Five?

2994
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:24,590
I had all the aces.

2995
01:43:24,590 --> 01:43:25,610
That's actually the god hand.

2996
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:28,610
I was going to tell you guys to just keep playing.

2997
01:43:28,710 --> 01:43:29,490
Don't call each other out.

2998
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:30,810
So force LM to come.

2999
01:43:32,670 --> 01:43:34,330
Hey guys, how many bullets am I on?

3000
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:36,490
You have two more.

3001
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:39,850
You can see in the top right, it shows how many question marks or something.

3002
01:43:39,970 --> 01:43:41,770
I guess I'll play these three aces.

3003
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:43,730
I can't believe it.

3004
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:45,470
Full hand and I couldn't use it.

3005
01:43:46,130 --> 01:43:48,670
I guess I'll just play these three aces I have.

3006
01:43:49,230 --> 01:43:50,450
Are you going to let him do it, man?

3007
01:43:50,570 --> 01:43:50,970
What?

3008
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:53,170
No way, no way, dude.

3009
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:54,890
Oh my god, no way.

3010
01:43:55,690 --> 01:43:57,790
There's no way you have three aces.

3011
01:43:57,790 --> 01:43:59,030
I'm going to play safe, too.

3012
01:43:59,030 --> 01:44:00,850
I guess I'll play this one ace I have, then.

3013
01:44:02,410 --> 01:44:02,550
Oh.

3014
01:44:03,190 --> 01:44:05,570
Yeah, I'd have to call him out or call him out the next round.

3015
01:44:07,090 --> 01:44:08,590
Because he's not going to call me out.

3016
01:44:08,650 --> 01:44:09,990
So I can play whatever card I want.

3017
01:44:10,610 --> 01:44:11,030
Oh yeah.

3018
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:12,010
Oh yeah.

3019
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:17,010
He'd rather just place his card instead of calling out.

3020
01:44:18,330 --> 01:44:18,730
Okay.

3021
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:19,590
Okay.

3022
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:22,090
Ace.

3023
01:44:22,410 --> 01:44:23,630
That's a lie, that's a lie.

3024
01:44:24,570 --> 01:44:28,970
I'm going to take your one ace and erase your whole turn.

3025
01:44:29,730 --> 01:44:30,810
That's a liar, she's a liar.

3026
01:44:31,190 --> 01:44:31,770
She's a liar.

3027
01:44:35,550 --> 01:44:37,150
Dude, Ellen, there's no way you live.

3028
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:38,190
You have five out of six.

3029
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:40,470
Bro, there's no way.

3030
01:44:41,110 --> 01:44:43,630
I'll shave my head if I die.

3031
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:44,890
Are you serious?

3032
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:47,310
This is twice in a row.

3033
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:50,290
He's always had the last bullet.

3034
01:44:50,630 --> 01:44:52,550
He's always had it.

3035
01:44:55,050 --> 01:44:57,770
Every time, he's had the last bullet.

3036
01:44:57,910 --> 01:44:58,830
That's actually crazy.

3037
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:04,570
Well, I guess I'll play these two queens, then.

3038
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:13,910
Ray's never going to call him out.

3039
01:45:14,270 --> 01:45:15,310
He's scared.

3040
01:45:16,510 --> 01:45:17,590
He's so scared.

3041
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:19,350
He just wants to play it safe.

3042
01:45:20,470 --> 01:45:22,370
He doesn't want to be a hero.

3043
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:24,150
Enjoy the bullets, Ray.

3044
01:45:24,150 --> 01:45:25,010
He's just a sheep.

3045
01:45:25,190 --> 01:45:26,910
Enjoy the bullets, habibi.

3046
01:45:27,730 --> 01:45:28,990
Enjoy the bullets.

3047
01:45:31,470 --> 01:45:32,590
Two queens.

3048
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:33,350
Damn.

3049
01:45:34,270 --> 01:45:35,150
Two queens.

3050
01:45:35,450 --> 01:45:36,410
Alright, alright.

3051
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:39,030
I'm going to get one queen, too.

3052
01:45:39,630 --> 01:45:43,430
Well, I guess I'll just play these three queens I have.

3053
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:43,990
What?

3054
01:45:45,210 --> 01:45:47,190
Ray, you should have called him.

3055
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:48,990
Ray, it doesn't matter, Ray.

3056
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:51,790
Three queens I have, I guess.

3057
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:53,490
Oh, wait, you're not?

3058
01:45:53,870 --> 01:45:55,770
Oh, it's only a 1v1.

3059
01:45:55,990 --> 01:45:56,250
Oh!

3060
01:45:57,370 --> 01:45:58,090
I'm just free.

3061
01:45:58,770 --> 01:45:59,350
I'm safe.

3062
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:01,510
That's crazy.

3063
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:02,910
That's crazy, yeah.

3064
01:46:05,830 --> 01:46:07,930
He's never going to call out, I feel like.

3065
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:09,010
Doki, you got to call that out.

3066
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:10,910
That's definitely a lie.

3067
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:14,270
Oh, yeah, you want me to call him out, too?

3068
01:46:14,350 --> 01:46:15,410
When you wouldn't call out him?

3069
01:46:15,430 --> 01:46:16,670
No, because I have two queens left.

3070
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:17,090
What?

3071
01:46:18,130 --> 01:46:20,010
Oh, dude, dude.

3072
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:21,370
Oh!

3073
01:46:22,670 --> 01:46:24,450
Yeah, because I do, too.

3074
01:46:25,370 --> 01:46:25,730
No way.

3075
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:26,870
That's a lie!

3076
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:29,570
Oh, no.

3077
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:32,730
I've been lying this whole time.

3078
01:46:32,830 --> 01:46:33,590
I had no queens.

3079
01:46:34,170 --> 01:46:35,350
I literally had no queens.

3080
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:36,690
That's crazy.

3081
01:46:37,230 --> 01:46:37,950
Dude, first bullet.

3082
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:39,010
Watch this.

3083
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:41,430
That would be so unlucky for Psycho.

3084
01:46:41,490 --> 01:46:42,770
Oh, he lives, he lives.

3085
01:46:43,510 --> 01:46:44,390
One bullet.

3086
01:46:45,210 --> 01:46:46,090
One bullet.

3087
01:46:46,770 --> 01:46:48,050
I had a lot of queens that one, actually.

3088
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:49,750
Okay.

3089
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:52,430
I mean, I'm still alive.

3090
01:46:54,290 --> 01:46:54,910
We're still alive.

3091
01:46:54,910 --> 01:46:56,630
Here we go, here we go.

3092
01:46:58,670 --> 01:46:59,550
Alright, alright.

3093
01:47:00,110 --> 01:47:00,950
What are we thinking then, guys?

3094
01:47:01,010 --> 01:47:01,310
What are we thinking?

3095
01:47:02,190 --> 01:47:04,910
Psychooner's thinking he's devising a plan right now.

3096
01:47:05,330 --> 01:47:08,870
I know Ellen would never call, so I'm not too worried anymore.

3097
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:09,730
Yeah, dude, Ellen would never call.

3098
01:47:10,010 --> 01:47:11,490
Yeah, Ellen never calls anyway.

3099
01:47:11,490 --> 01:47:12,830
No, I don't call.

3100
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:16,390
He doesn't call because he knows Ray wouldn't call him.

3101
01:47:16,470 --> 01:47:17,970
So he can put as many cards as he wants.

3102
01:47:18,130 --> 01:47:19,250
Three kings.

3103
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:20,930
Dude, no way.

3104
01:47:21,070 --> 01:47:22,090
Three kings.

3105
01:47:22,590 --> 01:47:25,590
Ray's just going to put one or two kings.

3106
01:47:26,530 --> 01:47:27,910
See, I know it.

3107
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:29,470
He doesn't call.

3108
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:32,670
Straight off of the rip.

3109
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:33,850
What are we on?

3110
01:47:33,890 --> 01:47:34,210
Kings?

3111
01:47:34,450 --> 01:47:35,250
Two kings.

3112
01:47:35,590 --> 01:47:37,430
Yeah, we're on two kings right now.

3113
01:47:37,710 --> 01:47:41,070
Well, I guess I'll just play these two kings then.

3114
01:47:41,650 --> 01:47:43,170
Dude, call him, bro.

3115
01:47:43,310 --> 01:47:43,830
Call him.

3116
01:47:44,030 --> 01:47:44,870
He's lying.

3117
01:47:45,450 --> 01:47:48,350
Do you want to send me to an early grave, Ray?

3118
01:47:48,470 --> 01:47:49,630
How are you feeling about this, man?

3119
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:51,070
Yeah, do it, coward.

3120
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:52,070
Do it, coward.

3121
01:47:52,170 --> 01:47:52,650
See what happens.

3122
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:54,630
See what happens, coward.

3123
01:47:55,870 --> 01:47:56,670
One king.

3124
01:47:57,090 --> 01:47:58,530
Oh, you just got bitched on.

3125
01:47:59,790 --> 01:48:00,190
What?

3126
01:48:02,210 --> 01:48:02,610
Bro.

3127
01:48:02,910 --> 01:48:04,230
You haven't called Psych once.

3128
01:48:04,310 --> 01:48:04,770
I'm just saying.

3129
01:48:05,530 --> 01:48:06,190
I can't call.

3130
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:07,190
He's opposite the table.

3131
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:08,890
Yeah, just because he doesn't lie.

3132
01:48:09,330 --> 01:48:09,550
Yeah, exactly.

3133
01:48:09,730 --> 01:48:10,690
I don't lie either.

3134
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:12,690
It's because I'm not lying, that's all.

3135
01:48:13,130 --> 01:48:13,250
Yeah.

3136
01:48:15,110 --> 01:48:16,190
That's all, yeah.

3137
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:17,930
And luckily, I actually did.

3138
01:48:18,110 --> 01:48:20,190
I saved my best card for last.

3139
01:48:20,590 --> 01:48:20,850
Yeah?

3140
01:48:21,550 --> 01:48:21,990
Liar.

3141
01:48:23,690 --> 01:48:24,750
It's you, Ashley.

3142
01:48:26,210 --> 01:48:27,490
Dude, I had no kings.

3143
01:48:27,790 --> 01:48:28,770
I had no kings.

3144
01:48:28,950 --> 01:48:29,610
I did nothing.

3145
01:48:31,330 --> 01:48:33,070
Yeah, your best card for last.

3146
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:34,330
What do you call a dopey out, by the way?

3147
01:48:34,430 --> 01:48:35,970
You're not calling BS at all.

3148
01:48:36,410 --> 01:48:37,730
No way!

3149
01:48:37,830 --> 01:48:39,190
On my second one?

3150
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:41,250
On the second one, man?

3151
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:42,130
That's insane.

3152
01:48:43,830 --> 01:48:47,930
How does Ellen go all the way to six and I'm down to my second shot?

3153
01:48:48,050 --> 01:48:48,590
That's crazy.

3154
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:51,230
That's just mad RNG at that point.

3155
01:48:51,850 --> 01:48:54,830
That's actually so unlucky for you.

3156
01:48:54,930 --> 01:48:55,610
Holy shit.

3157
01:48:55,610 --> 01:48:57,170
That's actually just terrible RNG.

3158
01:48:57,250 --> 01:48:58,850
I guess I'll play this one king, then.

3159
01:48:59,350 --> 01:48:59,890
He's lying.

3160
01:49:01,750 --> 01:49:02,810
He's lying, bro.

3161
01:49:02,810 --> 01:49:03,230
He's lying.

3162
01:49:06,730 --> 01:49:08,550
He's never gonna call him out.

3163
01:49:08,730 --> 01:49:09,570
We learned it.

3164
01:49:10,010 --> 01:49:12,090
We learned that he's never gonna call him out.

3165
01:49:12,430 --> 01:49:14,790
Okay, I guess I'll just play this one king, then.

3166
01:49:22,450 --> 01:49:24,010
Ray, there's no way, Ray.

3167
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:26,230
I feel like Ray is thinking hard about this game.

3168
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:27,630
Ray, Ray, Ray!

3169
01:49:27,950 --> 01:49:30,050
I think he plays this one king.

3170
01:49:30,290 --> 01:49:30,690
I do!

3171
01:49:32,690 --> 01:49:34,930
He plays one king!

3172
01:49:35,410 --> 01:49:36,210
That's a lie, by the way.

3173
01:49:36,450 --> 01:49:38,330
That is a lie.

3174
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:42,690
No!

3175
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:48,270
Oh my god, you got him.

3176
01:49:48,690 --> 01:49:49,230
You got him!

3177
01:49:49,590 --> 01:49:49,890
Ray!

3178
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:55,370
We're so proud of you!

3179
01:49:55,470 --> 01:49:57,290
Oh my god!

3180
01:49:57,650 --> 01:49:57,950
Goodbye, Adam!

3181
01:49:59,770 --> 01:49:59,910
No!

3182
01:50:00,510 --> 01:50:02,110
That was me and Romanov who did that.

3183
01:50:02,690 --> 01:50:03,670
No, Haribibi!

3184
01:50:03,670 --> 01:50:05,550
The hero's arc!

3185
01:50:05,970 --> 01:50:07,410
He finally did it!

3186
01:50:07,470 --> 01:50:09,430
He finally downloaded Elim!

3187
01:50:11,270 --> 01:50:12,310
Oh my god!

3188
01:50:12,930 --> 01:50:15,690
When we needed him the most, he figured it out.

3189
01:50:17,690 --> 01:50:18,590
Our hero.

3190
01:50:18,890 --> 01:50:19,190
One king.

3191
01:50:20,690 --> 01:50:21,790
Alright, one king.

3192
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:30,420
I honestly can't read Ray.

3193
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:34,320
Because he's just been placing one card.

3194
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:35,060
Okay.

3195
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:44,020
Is he still connected?

3196
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:46,140
Dude, he's thinking.

3197
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:46,860
One king.

3198
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:50,300
I can't tell if this is part of his strat to play.

3199
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:52,140
Me too, I can't tell anymore.

3200
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:53,860
Two kings.

3201
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:56,160
One king.

3202
01:50:56,300 --> 01:50:58,100
That's a lot of kings to play.

3203
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:00,440
Yeah, but I just have a lot of kings.

3204
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:01,680
That's all I'm...

3205
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:07,020
Yeah, I just had a lot of kings!

3206
01:51:07,490 --> 01:51:09,940
She actually just had a lot of kings.

3207
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:10,940
I just had it.

3208
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,820
This is his fourth shot, he might be...

3209
01:51:12,820 --> 01:51:14,120
No, I think he might live.

3210
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:14,980
He's gonna live.

3211
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:16,640
You know what?

3212
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:19,440
Dude, don't you want two in a row?

3213
01:51:19,820 --> 01:51:20,780
Yeah, I did it.

3214
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:22,580
Let's go.

3215
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:23,400
What do you mean two in a row?

3216
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:25,020
I fucking lost to Elim in that 1v1.

3217
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:26,900
Elim didn't call you once, by the way.

3218
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:28,360
Elim didn't call you once.

3219
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:29,540
I know he didn't.

3220
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:35,340
Because he knows you don't call him, so he just wants to keep putting cards.

3221
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:38,340
It makes so much sense.

3222
01:51:39,380 --> 01:51:40,760
Too much sense, perhaps.

3223
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:43,880
He's scared.

3224
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:45,000
Oh, he's back.

3225
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:46,620
I'm sorry, I was ending stream.

3226
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:48,500
I can probably do one more, then I gotta go rest my voice.

3227
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:49,680
Alright, last game.

3228
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:50,780
LG, LG this.

3229
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,080
Alright, we gotta wait for...

3230
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:55,760
Oh, wait.

3231
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:56,840
Ray's not back yet.

3232
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:57,900
Oh, it's all good.

3233
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:58,400
We can just wait.

3234
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,160
No, no, there's a time.

3235
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:01,040
There's a...

3236
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:02,820
Wait, Ray's not back, right?

3237
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:03,600
So I can do this.

3238
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,160
We can back out, otherwise.

3239
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:08,060
I mean, we could wait until...

3240
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:09,180
I don't know if it just goes.

3241
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:12,240
There's no way he can...

3242
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:13,740
There's no way...

3243
01:52:13,740 --> 01:52:15,840
I can't believe Elim ended his last stream ever.

3244
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:16,820
I know, guys.

3245
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:18,660
Guys, I'm sorry.

3246
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:20,800
I hope you guys enjoyed his very last stream.

3247
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:24,700
Who's first?

3248
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:25,460
Oh, Elim's.

3249
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:26,900
Wait, he left as well.

3250
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:32,080
Oh, Sykuno, it's up to you to call his bluff now.

3251
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:33,040
It's up to you.

3252
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:36,180
I mean, what happens if he's just AFK?

3253
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:37,860
Sorry, what happened?

3254
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,340
Oh, if he's AFK, I think he like...

3255
01:52:40,340 --> 01:52:41,260
I actually don't know.

3256
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:42,820
Maybe he just places a random card.

3257
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:44,500
So you got 50-50.

3258
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,140
It's Elim's turn.

3259
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:50,360
Oh, no.

3260
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:55,940
Oh, that's not him, by the way, Sykuno.

3261
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:57,960
That's not...

3262
01:52:57,960 --> 01:53:00,220
That's a 50-50 on the bot.

3263
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:02,140
Do you think that...

3264
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:04,100
Oh, it's...

3265
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:06,440
Oh, you think...

3266
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:08,780
You think it's possible?

3267
01:53:12,380 --> 01:53:13,340
Three aces.

3268
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:16,080
Three aces?

3269
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:19,680
Well, Elim is AFK, so he could take advantage of it.

3270
01:53:21,700 --> 01:53:22,660
Elim's AFK.

3271
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:23,500
Elim, call him out, dude.

3272
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:24,400
Call me out, bro.

3273
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,040
Call me out.

3274
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:26,820
Call him out, man.

3275
01:53:27,060 --> 01:53:27,980
Three aces?

3276
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:29,880
Damn, three aces?

3277
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:31,240
I'm telling you right now, I still have aces left.

3278
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:31,920
Yeah, me too.

3279
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,800
I still have four aces left.

3280
01:53:34,540 --> 01:53:35,840
Dude, there's no way he's got three aces.

3281
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:37,240
That's impossible, right?

3282
01:53:37,860 --> 01:53:39,300
You gotta read a bot now.

3283
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:50,980
Oh, my God!

3284
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:52,880
You won against the bot!

3285
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:54,100
Oh, my God.

3286
01:53:54,180 --> 01:53:56,260
Would it be a one and done?

3287
01:53:57,880 --> 01:53:58,840
Oh, my God.

3288
01:53:58,900 --> 01:53:59,260
Is it?

3289
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:00,120
I'm alive.

3290
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:01,860
Oh, my God.

3291
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:03,700
Holy crap, I'm alive.

3292
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:05,140
Jesus.

3293
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:06,600
Jesus.

3294
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:08,420
That would have been so funny.

3295
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:09,640
Okay.

3296
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:13,000
Let's see.

3297
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:15,640
Alright, queen time.

3298
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:18,180
Okay.

3299
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:23,620
Luckily for me, I've got these three queens right here.

3300
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:27,320
These three queens right here, guys.

3301
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:29,180
Surely, he has three queens.

3302
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:30,860
Surely, he has three queens.

3303
01:54:30,940 --> 01:54:31,300
Yeah.

3304
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:33,900
I have two.

3305
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:38,340
No, wait.

3306
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:38,980
No.

3307
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:40,200
Oh, my God.

3308
01:54:40,420 --> 01:54:41,900
Dude, why would you mix them?

3309
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:42,680
It doesn't make sense.

3310
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:43,700
I don't know.

3311
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:46,080
I don't die here.

3312
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:47,160
He dies, bro.

3313
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:47,800
He dies.

3314
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:48,620
He dies.

3315
01:54:48,940 --> 01:54:49,840
There's no way.

3316
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:52,300
How does he have so many lives?

3317
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:54,480
How does he never die in the first half?

3318
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,380
The game just wants him to live.

3319
01:54:56,380 --> 01:54:57,400
I knew it.

3320
01:54:57,460 --> 01:54:58,380
I knew I was fine.

3321
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:00,520
It's actually crazy.

3322
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:01,280
Yes.

3323
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:02,320
Yes.

3324
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:06,100
The three was actually a crazy thing to do.

3325
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:08,760
Holy Christ.

3326
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:09,380
Okay.

3327
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:10,020
Alright.

3328
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:11,660
Well...

3329
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:14,040
I guess I'll play these two kings, then.

3330
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:17,780
Oh, you think?

3331
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:18,680
You think I was lying?

3332
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:21,920
You think I was lying?

3333
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:24,780
He has the god hats and the dogs.

3334
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:25,860
I knew it.

3335
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:30,940
All I'm gonna say is that I had four kings and I could never use it.

3336
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:35,020
I had four kings.

3337
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:37,840
Four kings?

3338
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:38,260
Jesus.

3339
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:38,760
Yeah.

3340
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:42,700
The one before that, I had four aces.

3341
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:46,240
I will guess who has all the kings now.

3342
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:47,000
Oh.

3343
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:50,780
That's a lie.

3344
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:52,840
That's a lie?

3345
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:55,000
I wouldn't...

3346
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,140
He would never lie.

3347
01:55:56,420 --> 01:55:57,640
I know.

3348
01:55:58,700 --> 01:55:59,580
That would be so crazy.

3349
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:03,060
It would be a psychotic move.

3350
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:05,140
It would be crazy, I tell you.

3351
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:07,640
It would be so fucking insane.

3352
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:14,980
Well, I guess I'll play these two kings.

3353
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:16,960
That's a lie.

3354
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:18,980
That's a lie.

3355
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:21,620
Yeah, he's gonna play it safe.

3356
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:23,220
Look, my hand's empty.

3357
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:23,920
I'm immune now.

3358
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:24,860
Oh, yeah?

3359
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:26,040
I can't be targeted.

3360
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:28,260
You know what, Sakuno?

3361
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:31,360
I'm gonna try and see.

3362
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:35,020
Oh, he actually has it!

3363
01:56:35,180 --> 01:56:36,100
He didn't have the three before.

3364
01:56:37,580 --> 01:56:38,640
He didn't have the three kings.

3365
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:40,620
Oh, no.

3366
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:42,120
Don't look at me, please.

3367
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:43,600
Don't look at me, please.

3368
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:44,920
Oh, thank you.

3369
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:49,900
I had a bad hand.

3370
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:51,420
Ace table.

3371
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:52,480
Okay, it's my turn.

3372
01:56:54,860 --> 01:56:56,460
You know what?

3373
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:57,720
I'm gonna do what Sakuno did.

3374
01:56:58,580 --> 01:56:59,000
Huh?

3375
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:02,180
I'm gonna do what Sakuno did because it worked.

3376
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:04,460
Three aces.

3377
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:07,580
Three cards.

3378
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:09,040
Three aces?

3379
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:09,520
Yeah.

3380
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:12,560
Ray, there's no way, right?

3381
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:14,380
There's no way you just let that go.

3382
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:16,280
Three aces?

3383
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:17,520
Listen, I don't know.

3384
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:18,440
She seems confident.

3385
01:57:19,620 --> 01:57:21,340
What if I did one ace myself?

3386
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:23,840
That would be a lie.

3387
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:25,500
What if I did somewhat of an ace myself?

3388
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:28,360
Yeah, why would I do one of my aces myself, too?

3389
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:42,680
Okay.

3390
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:44,480
What if I do two aces?

3391
01:57:45,110 --> 01:57:45,340
Oh.

3392
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,840
That's a lot of aces.

3393
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:48,440
I knew it.

3394
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:49,400
I know he's a liar.

3395
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:50,540
Enjoy these bullets.

3396
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:53,120
Oh my god, dude.

3397
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:55,980
Why did you even pretend to the last second there?

3398
01:57:58,540 --> 01:58:00,540
My blood is on your hands, dammit.

3399
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:01,800
My blood is on your hands.

3400
01:58:02,140 --> 01:58:03,280
I'm fine.

3401
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:04,200
I'm fine.

3402
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:04,740
Holy shit.

3403
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:06,120
Oh my god.

3404
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:13,040
Oh, now it's your turn, Elim.

3405
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:16,320
Oh, another ace.

3406
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,920
He's already at three out of six bullets.

3407
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:18,400
I know.

3408
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:20,540
I wouldn't just play three aces, would I?

3409
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:23,720
Yes.

3410
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:25,360
Dude, no way.

3411
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:26,500
He actually wins.

3412
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:30,520
Enjoy the bullets, Aikuro.

3413
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:32,060
Enjoy the bullets.

3414
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:33,680
Okay, dude.

3415
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:36,120
If I die on my first bullet...

3416
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:36,880
No way.

3417
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:39,920
No way I die on the first one.

3418
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:41,700
Enjoy the bullets, brother.

3419
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:43,680
Enjoy them.

3420
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:45,740
Oh my god.

3421
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:47,660
That's a poor guy.

3422
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:49,760
Enjoy the bullets.

3423
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:53,600
Surely, he wouldn't call three kings.

3424
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:00,740
No!

3425
01:59:05,220 --> 01:59:06,420
Why'd you play two with it?

3426
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:06,920
I mixed.

3427
01:59:07,460 --> 01:59:08,920
Yeah, I mixed it.

3428
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:10,000
I mixed it.

3429
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:11,740
You can't always do that to me.

3430
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:12,700
Goodbye, Doki.

3431
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:15,220
Goodbye, Doki.

3432
01:59:15,540 --> 01:59:16,800
No, I'm still alive.

3433
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:18,200
I'm still alive.

3434
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:24,100
Oh, is it...

3435
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:25,220
Oh, it's my turn again.

3436
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:29,020
What is it?

3437
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:31,180
Alright.

3438
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:33,380
After that, I'm just gonna play safe now.

3439
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:35,500
Right.

3440
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:37,940
One ace.

3441
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:40,180
Liar.

3442
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:41,080
What?

3443
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:43,320
You actually got me.

3444
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:44,700
Wait, what?

3445
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:46,540
On a one?

3446
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:50,540
One is so scary to call.

3447
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:53,220
It's time to die, Ray.

3448
01:59:53,220 --> 01:59:54,260
It's time to die.

3449
01:59:54,260 --> 01:59:54,460
Damn it.

3450
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:56,180
Oh, he's still living.

3451
01:59:56,460 --> 01:59:57,680
Oh, that's Ray's one.

3452
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:01,140
I wanna see Ray and LM 1v1.

3453
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:04,340
I had four aces that one, by the way.

3454
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:07,180
Wait, and he's...

3455
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:08,120
Oh, that's crazy.

3456
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:09,220
Four aces.

3457
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:12,060
Four aces.

3458
02:00:17,750 --> 02:00:18,630
One ace.

3459
02:00:18,770 --> 02:00:19,630
One king.

3460
02:00:20,270 --> 02:00:21,170
Oh, king.

3461
02:00:23,890 --> 02:00:26,030
Luckily, I got these two kings right here.

3462
02:00:26,030 --> 02:00:27,050
Oh my god, thank god.

3463
02:00:27,150 --> 02:00:27,950
I actually put an ace down.

3464
02:00:29,190 --> 02:00:31,770
He actually put an ace down.

3465
02:00:32,870 --> 02:00:33,450
That's crazy.

3466
02:00:35,650 --> 02:00:36,210
Okay.

3467
02:00:38,270 --> 02:00:40,370
That means he has a king's LM.

3468
02:00:41,130 --> 02:00:41,890
Hmm.

3469
02:00:43,130 --> 02:00:43,890
Hmm.

3470
02:00:44,070 --> 02:00:46,270
If he got rid of his trash cards.

3471
02:00:47,510 --> 02:00:47,950
Hmm.

3472
02:00:49,910 --> 02:00:51,430
One king.

3473
02:00:52,430 --> 02:00:53,550
One king.

3474
02:00:53,550 --> 02:00:54,530
One king.

3475
02:00:55,830 --> 02:00:57,090
One king.

3476
02:00:57,570 --> 02:00:57,590
One king.

3477
02:00:59,230 --> 02:01:01,990
Are we all just gonna go ones?

3478
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:03,870
One, yeah, one king.

3479
02:01:04,050 --> 02:01:04,430
One king.

3480
02:01:04,810 --> 02:01:06,070
Dude, someone's lying.

3481
02:01:06,850 --> 02:01:07,690
Someone's lying.

3482
02:01:07,690 --> 02:01:08,790
Someone's lying.

3483
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:12,350
The liar was me.

3484
02:01:12,650 --> 02:01:13,450
The liar was me.

3485
02:01:13,450 --> 02:01:13,990
I wanna look.

3486
02:01:16,410 --> 02:01:17,310
My blood is on you.

3487
02:01:17,750 --> 02:01:18,910
My blood is on your hands.

3488
02:01:19,270 --> 02:01:20,550
Oh my god.

3489
02:01:20,790 --> 02:01:24,230
How does that Kuno die so early every time?

3490
02:01:25,490 --> 02:01:26,730
This is awesome.

3491
02:01:29,890 --> 02:01:31,030
Oh my god.

3492
02:01:32,110 --> 02:01:32,750
You know what?

3493
02:01:33,350 --> 02:01:35,890
I wanna Ray vs LM 1v1.

3494
02:01:38,670 --> 02:01:39,950
Three aces.

3495
02:01:39,970 --> 02:01:40,670
That's bullshit.

3496
02:01:41,150 --> 02:01:43,390
Even if it's not.

3497
02:01:43,970 --> 02:01:44,810
I'm not.

3498
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:46,990
I want to see a Ray vs LM.

3499
02:01:47,810 --> 02:01:49,050
So I will call this.

3500
02:01:49,130 --> 02:01:49,710
Oh my god.

3501
02:01:52,230 --> 02:01:52,950
Goodbye LM.

3502
02:01:53,610 --> 02:01:54,490
Goodbye LM.

3503
02:01:54,590 --> 02:01:55,230
Goodbye.

3504
02:01:58,130 --> 02:01:58,990
Goodbye LM.

3505
02:02:00,030 --> 02:02:00,550
Goodbye LM.

3506
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:03,450
Goodbye LM.

3507
02:02:04,330 --> 02:02:06,330
Goodbye LM.

3508
02:02:06,330 --> 02:02:07,590
Oh my god.

3509
02:02:07,950 --> 02:02:09,510
That's insanity.

3510
02:02:10,230 --> 02:02:11,650
It doesn't seem possible.

3511
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:12,510
I'm alive.

3512
02:02:13,210 --> 02:02:15,290
It doesn't seem possible.

3513
02:02:16,050 --> 02:02:17,270
I'm alive.

3514
02:02:18,970 --> 02:02:21,570
And what if I played these three kings then?

3515
02:02:22,510 --> 02:02:25,310
I still wanna see a Ray vs LM 1v1.

3516
02:02:28,730 --> 02:02:29,510
You're not going to.

3517
02:02:29,590 --> 02:02:30,750
Oh my god.

3518
02:02:31,630 --> 02:02:33,530
Dude, LM's insane for that.

3519
02:02:33,530 --> 02:02:35,690
He's insane for that.

3520
02:02:35,710 --> 02:02:36,310
He's insane.

3521
02:02:37,290 --> 02:02:38,930
Don't look me in the eye.

3522
02:02:39,130 --> 02:02:40,390
Don't look me in the eye.

3523
02:02:41,070 --> 02:02:42,770
He's crazy for that one.

3524
02:02:42,810 --> 02:02:43,730
Oh my god.

3525
02:02:43,870 --> 02:02:45,430
That's actually crazy.

3526
02:02:45,450 --> 02:02:46,870
Twice in a row?

3527
02:02:48,990 --> 02:02:51,470
I didn't think you would actually do it.

3528
02:02:51,510 --> 02:02:52,410
You're madman.

3529
02:02:52,850 --> 02:02:53,710
I thought you would let it go.

3530
02:02:54,310 --> 02:02:57,970
You're actually a fucking madman right there.

3531
02:02:58,670 --> 02:02:58,990
Anyway.

3532
02:02:59,930 --> 02:03:00,890
One queen.

3533
02:03:00,890 --> 02:03:02,150
He's actually kind of good at this.

3534
02:03:03,570 --> 02:03:05,130
No, that was pure random.

3535
02:03:06,270 --> 02:03:07,370
Oh, okay.

3536
02:03:07,970 --> 02:03:08,490
Sure.

3537
02:03:10,270 --> 02:03:11,210
Oh shit.

3538
02:03:12,630 --> 02:03:13,830
I had so many queens.

3539
02:03:13,890 --> 02:03:14,650
How did you have a queen?

3540
02:03:15,010 --> 02:03:16,510
I had two queens.

3541
02:03:16,670 --> 02:03:17,470
That's right.

3542
02:03:17,850 --> 02:03:19,830
I had two queens.

3543
02:03:20,210 --> 02:03:20,850
Oh, he lives.

3544
02:03:21,470 --> 02:03:23,910
Oh my god.

3545
02:03:24,090 --> 02:03:26,070
LM lived to the very last bullet.

3546
02:03:26,190 --> 02:03:27,110
That's actually insane.

3547
02:03:27,750 --> 02:03:31,330
He has that happen to him three times already.

3548
02:03:32,630 --> 02:03:33,130
God damn it.

3549
02:03:34,310 --> 02:03:36,010
Dude, it's because he's the host.

3550
02:03:36,470 --> 02:03:37,470
That's true.

3551
02:03:37,850 --> 02:03:39,410
He has the host advantage.

3552
02:03:40,190 --> 02:03:42,070
That's so true.

3553
02:03:43,310 --> 02:03:45,550
He always has the host advantage.

3554
02:03:46,250 --> 02:03:46,650
No.

3555
02:03:47,330 --> 02:03:49,030
He's got host advantage.

3556
02:03:49,350 --> 02:03:49,810
Yeah.

3557
02:03:52,390 --> 02:03:53,170
One ace.

3558
02:03:54,050 --> 02:03:54,810
One ace.

3559
02:03:55,710 --> 02:03:56,810
Me too.

3560
02:03:57,370 --> 02:03:58,810
I have one ace.

3561
02:03:59,270 --> 02:04:00,090
They're playing safe now.

3562
02:04:00,310 --> 02:04:02,650
You know what?

3563
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:03,830
I'll take the 50-50.

3564
02:04:04,090 --> 02:04:04,950
I can't read, Ray.

3565
02:04:05,330 --> 02:04:06,130
I'll be a mit.

3566
02:04:06,370 --> 02:04:07,330
I can't read him.

3567
02:04:07,950 --> 02:04:09,430
Oh my god.

3568
02:04:12,590 --> 02:04:13,710
Game over.

3569
02:04:14,550 --> 02:04:15,550
Goodbye, Doki.

3570
02:04:16,270 --> 02:04:17,290
Goodbye, everybody.

3571
02:04:18,050 --> 02:04:19,170
Hey guys.

3572
02:04:20,670 --> 02:04:21,710
Dude, it's 3-6.

3573
02:04:23,690 --> 02:04:25,070
It's actually close.

3574
02:04:25,270 --> 02:04:26,330
It's very close.

3575
02:04:26,450 --> 02:04:28,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3576
02:04:30,410 --> 02:04:31,730
Oh, it's ace.

3577
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:34,010
Okay.

3578
02:04:34,690 --> 02:04:35,170
Ace.

3579
02:04:36,610 --> 02:04:38,250
We're gonna play safe now.

3580
02:04:39,430 --> 02:04:40,230
Two aces.

3581
02:04:40,770 --> 02:04:41,690
Two aces?

3582
02:04:41,710 --> 02:04:42,490
That's a gamble.

3583
02:04:42,910 --> 02:04:43,690
That is.

3584
02:04:44,210 --> 02:04:47,210
If he's gonna gamble, I'm gonna gamble too.

3585
02:04:47,970 --> 02:04:50,250
You think he's just got two aces just like that?

3586
02:04:50,250 --> 02:04:52,350
Yes, look at him.

3587
02:04:52,450 --> 02:04:53,710
He's quiet too.

3588
02:04:54,270 --> 02:04:54,990
He's quiet.

3589
02:04:55,290 --> 02:04:57,610
I know.

3590
02:04:57,790 --> 02:04:58,830
I can't read him.

3591
02:04:58,950 --> 02:05:02,550
I never had a chance to have him there.

3592
02:05:03,110 --> 02:05:04,230
You are reading me.

3593
02:05:04,270 --> 02:05:05,130
You actually just read me.

3594
02:05:05,910 --> 02:05:08,150
Wait, what does that mean?

3595
02:05:08,270 --> 02:05:10,250
I had two aces.

3596
02:05:11,430 --> 02:05:12,090
What does that mean?

3597
02:05:14,570 --> 02:05:15,070
One...

3598
02:05:15,890 --> 02:05:16,890
One ace.

3599
02:05:17,750 --> 02:05:18,110
Okay.

3600
02:05:27,530 --> 02:05:28,370
Alright.

3601
02:05:31,090 --> 02:05:31,930
Alright.

3602
02:05:32,430 --> 02:05:33,730
One ace.

3603
02:05:34,130 --> 02:05:34,850
Alright.

3604
02:05:35,550 --> 02:05:36,490
Oh god.

3605
02:05:38,150 --> 02:05:38,630
Liar.

3606
02:05:39,410 --> 02:05:40,050
Alright.

3607
02:05:40,370 --> 02:05:41,670
Oh god.

3608
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:42,330
Just kidding.

3609
02:05:42,690 --> 02:05:44,570
I had no more.

3610
02:05:44,650 --> 02:05:45,690
I had no more aces.

3611
02:05:45,690 --> 02:05:49,810
I had no more aces, man.

3612
02:05:51,170 --> 02:05:52,650
I had no more aces.

3613
02:05:52,650 --> 02:05:53,450
I had no more aces, bro.

3614
02:05:53,650 --> 02:05:55,070
I had no more.

3615
02:05:56,370 --> 02:05:57,910
Oh man, oh man.

3616
02:05:57,930 --> 02:06:00,330
There was nothing I could do.

3617
02:06:01,030 --> 02:06:02,890
I get shot either way.

3618
02:06:03,210 --> 02:06:04,150
Oh god.

3619
02:06:05,050 --> 02:06:07,370
I still live though, which is nice.

3620
02:06:08,550 --> 02:06:09,630
Two queens?

3621
02:06:11,490 --> 02:06:13,250
That's a bold move.

3622
02:06:13,790 --> 02:06:14,530
That is.

3623
02:06:15,170 --> 02:06:16,770
A bold move.

3624
02:06:17,710 --> 02:06:18,350
One queen.

3625
02:06:19,310 --> 02:06:19,990
Alright.

3626
02:06:22,710 --> 02:06:24,370
Okay, Sykuno, my life is...

3627
02:06:24,370 --> 02:06:25,850
You know him longer than me.

3628
02:06:26,470 --> 02:06:27,770
I literally just met him, Sykuno.

3629
02:06:28,650 --> 02:06:29,290
It's not a lie.

3630
02:06:30,510 --> 02:06:31,830
What is your call?

3631
02:06:32,050 --> 02:06:33,110
How do you read him?

3632
02:06:35,490 --> 02:06:36,890
What is your call?

3633
02:06:37,470 --> 02:06:39,870
It's like such a risky move to go for a one.

3634
02:06:39,970 --> 02:06:41,430
I know, that's why.

3635
02:06:41,730 --> 02:06:43,710
But like...

3636
02:06:43,710 --> 02:06:44,630
But this is...

3637
02:06:44,630 --> 02:06:46,210
No one's gonna lie on their first hand.

3638
02:06:47,310 --> 02:06:48,630
He sounds stressed out though.

3639
02:06:48,650 --> 02:06:50,570
He sounds really stressed out, yeah.

3640
02:06:51,190 --> 02:06:52,530
Sounds pretty stressed out.

3641
02:06:52,910 --> 02:06:54,210
But he might be acting.

3642
02:06:55,050 --> 02:06:56,630
That's why I'm scared of him.

3643
02:06:59,070 --> 02:07:02,730
I only had nearly one.

3644
02:07:03,130 --> 02:07:04,770
I had one card.

3645
02:07:06,930 --> 02:07:08,590
Oh my god, Sykuno.

3646
02:07:10,710 --> 02:07:11,870
I'm still here.

3647
02:07:13,230 --> 02:07:14,810
I'm still here.

3648
02:07:15,010 --> 02:07:16,170
I'm still here.

3649
02:07:22,250 --> 02:07:23,350
I'm still here.

3650
02:07:25,090 --> 02:07:26,710
I'm still here.

3651
02:07:27,050 --> 02:07:29,950
If he came back from this, that'd just be insane.

3652
02:07:30,170 --> 02:07:31,270
No, I don't think so.

3653
02:07:31,330 --> 02:07:32,470
No, I literally can't...

3654
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:34,590
I literally can't read him, though.

3655
02:07:34,750 --> 02:07:35,290
That's the thing.

3656
02:07:35,790 --> 02:07:38,790
If you play one queen, I'm gonna play one queen.

3657
02:07:39,490 --> 02:07:42,290
Oh my god, if you play one queen, I'm gonna play one queen.

3658
02:07:42,970 --> 02:07:46,310
If you play one queen, I'm gonna play one queen.

3659
02:07:47,030 --> 02:07:50,270
If you play one queen, I'm gonna play one queen.

3660
02:07:51,950 --> 02:07:52,590
Sykuno.

3661
02:07:53,730 --> 02:07:54,370
Bullshit.

3662
02:07:54,850 --> 02:07:56,870
Oh no!

3663
02:07:57,750 --> 02:07:58,930
Oh my god, no way!

3664
02:07:59,370 --> 02:08:00,830
He's dead.

3665
02:08:01,010 --> 02:08:01,630
I'm dead.

3666
02:08:01,810 --> 02:08:02,570
He got it.

3667
02:08:02,890 --> 02:08:03,830
He got it.

3668
02:08:05,310 --> 02:08:06,470
Goodbye, Donkey.

3669
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:07,230
Goodbye.

3670
02:08:07,570 --> 02:08:11,430
I couldn't read him at all.

3671
02:08:11,550 --> 02:08:12,210
Oh my god.

3672
02:08:12,390 --> 02:08:13,950
He was too good.

3673
02:08:14,050 --> 02:08:15,150
He had a growth.

3674
02:08:15,570 --> 02:08:17,350
We're getting better, chat.

3675
02:08:17,430 --> 02:08:17,910
We're getting better.

3676
02:08:19,570 --> 02:08:21,150
I knew he was gonna smurf to this.

3677
02:08:21,310 --> 02:08:22,430
I don't lie, guys.

3678
02:08:22,470 --> 02:08:22,890
I don't lie.

3679
02:08:22,990 --> 02:08:23,790
I don't know what you're talking about.

3680
02:08:24,850 --> 02:08:25,650
He's goaded.

3681
02:08:27,910 --> 02:08:28,970
Oh my god.

3682
02:08:31,350 --> 02:08:31,750
GG's.

3683
02:08:31,770 --> 02:08:33,450
And Elim had to go, so...

3684
02:08:33,450 --> 02:08:34,190
Yeah, yeah.

3685
02:08:34,410 --> 02:08:36,150
Ray read me so well there.

3686
02:08:36,270 --> 02:08:36,790
I couldn't.

3687
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:37,510
I could not.

3688
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:38,390
I didn't know.

3689
02:08:39,810 --> 02:08:41,290
Some good games, guys.

3690
02:08:41,950 --> 02:08:42,470
GG's, guys.

3691
02:08:42,570 --> 02:08:42,930
Thank you for the games.

3692
02:08:44,710 --> 02:08:45,470
Bye, Elim.

3693
02:08:45,490 --> 02:08:45,950
Bye, Sykes.

3694
02:08:46,990 --> 02:08:47,470
GG's.

3695
02:08:47,470 --> 02:08:48,710
Nice to meet you, too.

3696
02:08:50,550 --> 02:08:51,030
GG's.

3697
02:08:51,170 --> 02:08:52,030
Bye, bye, everybody.

3698
02:08:52,950 --> 02:08:53,930
Good games, everybody.

3699
02:08:54,170 --> 02:08:54,590
Bye, bye.

3700
02:08:56,510 --> 02:08:57,550
Oh my god.

3701
02:08:57,610 --> 02:08:58,530
I could not read Ray.

3702
02:08:58,690 --> 02:09:02,490
I couldn't because I never had a chance to 1v1 Ray before.

3703
02:09:02,910 --> 02:09:08,630
Even for the bluffing call thing, it was...

3704
02:09:09,390 --> 02:09:10,670
I couldn't tell.

3705
02:09:14,470 --> 02:09:16,270
It was so difficult.

3706
02:09:16,610 --> 02:09:18,650
He got really good at the end.

3707
02:09:18,770 --> 02:09:20,070
He had nothing much to read.

3708
02:09:20,350 --> 02:09:21,410
He was so quiet.

3709
02:09:22,970 --> 02:09:24,530
He was so quiet.

3710
02:09:25,790 --> 02:09:26,990
Okay, so...

3711
02:09:26,990 --> 02:09:28,430
So, how I read...

3712
02:09:28,430 --> 02:09:35,830
Okay, how I read Sykuno was that every time he's lying, he would argue against somebody.

3713
02:09:36,070 --> 02:09:37,410
So, I knew he was lying.

3714
02:09:37,870 --> 02:09:42,090
And then, every time, he would be like, but what if I do this?

3715
02:09:42,310 --> 02:09:45,630
That's when I know he's actually doing the thing that he's doing.

3716
02:09:45,790 --> 02:09:49,150
So, if he's like, oh, but you can also lie, too, like this.

3717
02:09:49,250 --> 02:09:50,110
And then, I'm like, okay.

3718
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:51,910
That's his tell.

3719
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:53,830
Which I noticed.

3720
02:09:56,490 --> 02:10:00,410
When he starts arguing with people, that's when I know he's lying.

3721
02:10:07,210 --> 02:10:09,530
But Ray, he was really quiet.

3722
02:10:09,530 --> 02:10:14,450
So, it was very difficult because he wouldn't say anything.

3723
02:10:15,290 --> 02:10:18,290
And he would play very, very safe.

3724
02:10:19,170 --> 02:10:29,090
And when he plays very safe, it was very difficult to read because throughout all those games, he rarely ever called out Elim.

3725
02:10:29,470 --> 02:10:32,670
And he used it to like...

3726
02:10:32,670 --> 02:10:35,530
He never called out Elim, so he just kept placing cards.

3727
02:10:35,690 --> 02:10:38,370
So, I could never read him at all.

3728
02:10:42,410 --> 02:10:43,630
Yeah, yeah.

3729
02:10:43,730 --> 02:10:50,670
So, because he was super quiet, it was very hard to tell what...

3730
02:10:50,670 --> 02:10:55,670
I literally had to 50-50 every time.

3731
02:10:55,870 --> 02:10:57,170
Every time.

3732
02:10:57,890 --> 02:10:59,010
Yeah, yeah.

3733
02:11:00,010 --> 02:11:07,530
It was always a 50-50 every time, so I could never figure it out.

3734
02:11:07,630 --> 02:11:08,690
I could never figure it out.

3735
02:11:08,690 --> 02:11:08,870
But...

3736
02:11:10,490 --> 02:11:12,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3737
02:11:12,470 --> 02:11:13,930
What tell did you get from...

3738
02:11:13,930 --> 02:11:15,010
Oh, I talked about Sakuno.

3739
02:11:15,250 --> 02:11:19,690
Chilled's tell is that he gets super aggressive.

3740
02:11:20,050 --> 02:11:26,490
He gets super aggressive when he is telling the truth.

3741
02:11:28,050 --> 02:11:28,650
Um...

3742
02:11:29,190 --> 02:11:29,490
He...

3743
02:11:29,490 --> 02:11:31,170
He'd like...

3744
02:11:31,170 --> 02:11:34,910
Because he wants you to call him out as a liar.

3745
02:11:35,530 --> 02:11:38,790
But, like, he gets super aggressive when he's telling the truth.

3746
02:11:39,190 --> 02:11:45,310
So, he tries to bait you to call him out as a liar when he has the right cards.

3747
02:11:45,850 --> 02:11:47,030
LM swapped up.

3748
02:11:47,250 --> 02:11:52,670
LM had a very easy tell, but then he swapped it up, so it was very hard to figure it out after that.

3749
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:55,510
He mixed it up a lot.

3750
02:11:55,870 --> 02:11:57,470
I think he just got, like, tired too.

3751
02:11:57,630 --> 02:11:59,410
So, like, I think he got, like...

3752
02:11:59,410 --> 02:12:01,190
Because he had, like...

3753
02:12:01,190 --> 02:12:02,910
He wanted to rest his voice.

3754
02:12:02,910 --> 02:12:04,530
So, he, like...

3755
02:12:04,530 --> 02:12:07,750
He had, like, a different energy later on.

3756
02:12:08,110 --> 02:12:09,470
So, um...

3757
02:12:09,470 --> 02:12:11,870
So, like, it was getting harder to figure out.

3758
02:12:11,950 --> 02:12:12,890
So, I had to...

3759
02:12:12,890 --> 02:12:14,690
Beginning, it was easy to do it.

3760
02:12:14,870 --> 02:12:23,170
And then, at the end, his tells were getting harder because he was also getting tired and, like, playing differently.

3761
02:12:23,670 --> 02:12:23,930
Yeah.

3762
02:12:25,550 --> 02:12:26,010
Um...

3763
02:12:26,010 --> 02:12:28,270
So, that's why, like, at the end...

3764
02:12:28,270 --> 02:12:28,950
Like, when I had...

3765
02:12:28,950 --> 02:12:33,970
At the end, it was hard to figure it out because he, like, changed the way he played.

3766
02:12:34,750 --> 02:12:35,030
Uh...

3767
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:36,470
Yeah, it's the late game diff.

3768
02:12:36,570 --> 02:12:36,750
Yeah.

3769
02:12:40,090 --> 02:12:41,650
I'm pretty sure I have easy tells.

3770
02:12:41,830 --> 02:12:44,030
I'm pretty sure I have really easy tells.

3771
02:12:44,950 --> 02:12:45,370
Um...

3772
02:12:45,370 --> 02:12:45,950
But, yeah.

3773
02:12:46,590 --> 02:12:48,270
And he had, like, insane luck.

3774
02:12:48,290 --> 02:12:50,830
He should have died early on multiple times.

3775
02:12:50,950 --> 02:12:51,850
But that was a fun game!

3776
02:12:51,890 --> 02:12:53,390
I'm so happy I got to play it.

3777
02:12:53,530 --> 02:12:55,790
I'm very happy I got to...

3778
02:12:56,370 --> 02:12:58,390
I got to play it.

3779
02:12:58,390 --> 02:13:00,470
Because I wanted to try out Liar's Bar.

3780
02:13:00,670 --> 02:13:03,470
So, I hope I get to play it again with another...

3781
02:13:03,470 --> 02:13:04,170
Uh...

3782
02:13:04,170 --> 02:13:05,150
With another person.

3783
02:13:05,390 --> 02:13:06,290
With another group, too.

3784
02:13:06,670 --> 02:13:09,230
Because I feel like it would be different with other people, as well.

3785
02:13:09,570 --> 02:13:10,150
But, yes!

3786
02:13:10,230 --> 02:13:11,290
Everybody, thank you all!

3787
02:13:11,410 --> 02:13:12,510
It was, uh...

3788
02:13:12,510 --> 02:13:15,730
It was a lot of stuff for today.

3789
02:13:18,170 --> 02:13:18,530
Um...

3790
02:13:18,530 --> 02:13:19,890
It was honestly, like...

3791
02:13:19,890 --> 02:13:21,390
A lot of stuff was going on today.

3792
02:13:21,550 --> 02:13:24,170
So, thank you everybody for watching!

3793
02:13:24,330 --> 02:13:25,810
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

3794
02:13:25,810 --> 02:13:27,310
I hope you guys enjoyed the Deadlock stream.

3795
02:13:27,790 --> 02:13:28,870
And the, um...

3796
02:13:28,870 --> 02:13:29,710
And the collab today.

3797
02:13:29,850 --> 02:13:30,770
We also have another collab.

3798
02:13:30,890 --> 02:13:33,650
We have Devour Collab with Raimu, Mint, and Snuffy.

3799
02:13:33,830 --> 02:13:35,230
So, that will be tomorrow, as well.

3800
02:13:35,310 --> 02:13:36,770
It's been a very packed week.

3801
02:13:37,150 --> 02:13:37,550
Um...

3802
02:13:37,550 --> 02:13:41,330
So, I know I didn't post my schedule on YouTube Community Post.

3803
02:13:41,430 --> 02:13:43,010
But I will, uh...

3804
02:13:43,010 --> 02:13:43,650
Later today.

3805
02:13:43,710 --> 02:13:45,310
I just wanted to fix up the schedule.

3806
02:13:45,510 --> 02:13:46,330
Because, like, you know...

3807
02:13:46,330 --> 02:13:47,030
It was wrong.

3808
02:13:47,590 --> 02:13:51,330
Regarding the Minecraft Block Wars time slot.

3809
02:13:51,470 --> 02:13:53,130
So, I'll fix that later.

3810
02:13:53,390 --> 02:13:55,970
I'll fix that after I walk Dad.

3811
02:13:56,330 --> 02:13:57,970
And after I walk and feed Dad.

3812
02:13:58,250 --> 02:13:59,050
And, by the way...

3813
02:13:59,870 --> 02:14:01,930
Dad came back fatter.

3814
02:14:06,330 --> 02:14:06,850
He...

3815
02:14:06,850 --> 02:14:09,490
I think the babysitter...

3816
02:14:09,490 --> 02:14:10,790
Gave him a lot of food.

3817
02:14:10,910 --> 02:14:13,290
So, I could tell he got a little plump.

3818
02:14:13,530 --> 02:14:15,970
He got a little bit more plump.

3819
02:14:20,130 --> 02:14:22,230
So, I got...

3820
02:14:23,250 --> 02:14:23,650
Um...

3821
02:14:23,650 --> 02:14:24,670
So, he has to go...

3822
02:14:24,670 --> 02:14:25,890
No, he doesn't have to go on a diet.

3823
02:14:26,070 --> 02:14:27,130
But, I'm just gonna feed him.

3824
02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:28,310
Like, my usual.

3825
02:14:28,690 --> 02:14:31,430
I always try to make sure not to overfeed Wiener Dogs.

3826
02:14:31,550 --> 02:14:33,770
Because, Wiener Dogs can get overweight really easily.

3827
02:14:34,830 --> 02:14:35,930
Because, they're, you know...

3828
02:14:35,930 --> 02:14:37,210
They're, like, really long and stuff.

3829
02:14:37,530 --> 02:14:38,590
So, um...

3830
02:14:38,590 --> 02:14:42,490
A fat Wiener Dog is not good for them.

3831
02:14:42,570 --> 02:14:43,810
Because, you know, their spine.

3832
02:14:44,170 --> 02:14:46,430
So, I'm making sure that he doesn't eat too much.

3833
02:14:48,090 --> 02:14:48,890
Now, um...

3834
02:14:48,890 --> 02:14:49,570
Too much today.

3835
02:14:50,430 --> 02:14:51,470
Just keep it simple.

3836
02:14:51,930 --> 02:14:53,290
How I usually feed him.

3837
02:14:53,610 --> 02:14:54,570
So, we'll see from there.

3838
02:14:54,630 --> 02:14:55,210
Anyway, guys.

3839
02:14:56,190 --> 02:14:57,230
Thank you all for coming.

3840
02:14:57,330 --> 02:14:58,610
It was really fun today.

3841
02:14:59,030 --> 02:15:00,210
As always, everybody.

3842
02:15:01,530 --> 02:15:02,330
Stay hydrated.

3843
02:15:02,470 --> 02:15:03,010
Posture check.

3844
02:15:03,850 --> 02:15:04,170
Get up.

3845
02:15:04,190 --> 02:15:04,590
Move around.

3846
02:15:05,850 --> 02:15:06,930
Check that blood flowing.

3847
02:15:07,290 --> 02:15:08,790
If you stay up for me, head to bed.

3848
02:15:08,850 --> 02:15:10,030
Because, you deserve it.

3849
02:15:10,110 --> 02:15:11,130
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3850
02:15:11,130 --> 02:15:11,770
Bye, guys.

3851
02:15:12,130 --> 02:15:13,530
Unfortunately, we won't be doing Day 2.

3852
02:15:13,650 --> 02:15:14,670
I know we made it to Day 2.

3853
02:15:14,870 --> 02:15:15,750
I feel really bad.

3854
02:15:15,890 --> 02:15:17,070
Because, um...

3855
02:15:17,070 --> 02:15:18,670
I honestly thought that, like...

3856
02:15:18,670 --> 02:15:21,030
Our team would be ready for Day 2 as well.

3857
02:15:21,410 --> 02:15:23,710
But, it was way too early.

3858
02:15:23,910 --> 02:15:25,410
I also thought we wouldn't make it to Day 2.

3859
02:15:25,850 --> 02:15:26,250
So...

3860
02:15:27,190 --> 02:15:28,450
And we did try...

3861
02:15:28,450 --> 02:15:31,710
We did try to move around our schedules.

3862
02:15:31,930 --> 02:15:33,630
I did move around my schedule today.

3863
02:15:33,790 --> 02:15:34,950
To accommodate the tournament.

3864
02:15:35,170 --> 02:15:35,750
For the charity.

3865
02:15:38,010 --> 02:15:38,810
So, uh...

3866
02:15:38,810 --> 02:15:40,910
I hope that whoever...

3867
02:15:41,770 --> 02:15:42,820
Whoever replaces us...

3868
02:15:44,150 --> 02:15:44,490
You know...

3869
02:15:44,490 --> 02:15:45,410
Have a great time.

3870
02:15:45,590 --> 02:15:46,430
Anyway, guys.

3871
02:15:46,510 --> 02:15:47,850
I'm gonna see you guys next time, everybody.

3872
02:15:48,630 --> 02:15:49,530
Bye, guys.

3873
02:15:50,150 --> 02:15:50,570
Bye!

3874
02:17:40,550 --> 02:17:41,390
Secret ending.

3875
02:17:42,770 --> 02:17:45,590
The first walk I took dad on, he barked at a dog.

3876
02:17:45,750 --> 02:17:47,190
I don't fucking know what my...

3877
02:17:47,190 --> 02:17:49,430
I don't know what the fucking babysitter meant...

3878
02:17:49,430 --> 02:17:50,970
When he said he never barked at any dogs.

3879
02:17:51,010 --> 02:17:53,310
The very first walk I took him, he barked at a fucking dog.

3880
02:17:53,310 --> 02:17:55,350
In the first 30 seconds.

3881
02:17:55,590 --> 02:17:56,690
This fucking sucks.

3882
02:17:56,810 --> 02:17:57,050
Bye.

3883
02:18:00,590 --> 02:18:02,310
Okay, it doesn't fucking suck.

3884
02:18:02,570 --> 02:18:03,930
But like, who are you?

3885
02:18:04,350 --> 02:18:05,830
Who the fuck are you?

3886
02:18:06,150 --> 02:18:06,790
Anyway, bye.
