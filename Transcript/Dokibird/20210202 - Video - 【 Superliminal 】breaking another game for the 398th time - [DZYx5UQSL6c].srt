1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,820
Whoa, I'm tiny!

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,820
Look at me, I'm tiny!

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,900
Why am I so tiny?

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,820
What the fuck?

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,160
I don't know how I fucked that up.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,400
Look at me, I'm baby.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,500
Holy shit, I was so tiny guys.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,020
It was called optical illusion right there.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,840
Let me fix this.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,480
I'm gonna do a magic trick again guys.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,940
That was my second magic trick.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,540
Wait, give me a sec.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,240
Also, thank you for the five bits.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,380
Thank you Foget!

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,920
Tier 3 for five months in a row.

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,760
Can I get some barf nights real quick for Foget?

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,500
Let me fix this real quick.

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,220
My thingy is broken a bit.

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,440
I'll do a magic trick.

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:53,900
Watch this.

21
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,080
I'll do a magic trick with me.

22
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,300
BOOF!

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,220
CRIMBO!

24
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,460
Thank you for the tier 2 as well!

25
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:14,640
Woo!

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,920
Can I get some barf nights for Crimbo and Foget today?

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,780
Holy shit.

28
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,440
Alright, so let me say hi to- oh god I was so tiny.

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,240
I have no idea- I don't know how I fucked up.

30
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,240
I always fuck up somehow.

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,520
Every time I start stream.

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,800
I would like spend like five minutes trying to make sure I don't, but it always happens.

33
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,820
Doesn't matter how many times I prepare myself, I'll fuck up anyway.

34
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,800
So I was like, let me say hi to everyone.

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,260
Taluki Liquid, Matheo Ice, uh, who else?

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:54,160
Sneak- uh, Sneaking, Victor Zeno Crimbo, Foget, Lancer, uh, Major, Cryptic, Acer, Foget, Fluffy- I know I think I pretty much repeated people's names already.

37
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,620
I already forgot who I said hi to.

38
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,840
Gilgamesh, Acid, Starry, Lcrunchy, Ninten, ABOX, P.D.F.

39
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,100
Hello everyone!

40
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,000
Hi!

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,760
Hi, hi, hi.

42
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
Cheetop, hi guys!

43
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,380
Okay.

44
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,360
So, guys here in Foget.

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,900
I hope I didn't find her today.

46
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,140
I know it's a Z too.

47
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,200
I was so tiny.

48
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,120
Dude, that was magic.

49
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,180
Alright, so let me tell you guys about what I know about this game.

50
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,200
I know nothing about this game.

51
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,500
I just know it's a puzzle game.

52
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,920
And I was like, damn.

53
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,000
I had four hours of sleep, guys.

54
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,680
Do you think I could do this puzzle game with four hours of sleep?

55
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,120
I was like, here's a flip-flop for you, Vox.

56
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,140
Okay, can we help you?

57
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,380
I mean, sure, please.

58
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,200
I think I need all the help I can get.

59
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,780
Okay, this game can use flashing lights.

60
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,180
Alright, I just won't look at it.

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,580
Sure, why not?

62
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,040
See, it's easy.

63
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,540
All you need to know is up equals big, down equals small.

64
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,020
Yeah.

65
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,520
Okay, alright, cool.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,640
...for facing massive dilemmas, or for allowing the smallest problems to get blown completely out of proportion.

67
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,340
Dude, what the fuck?

68
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,460
Don't diagnose me.

69
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,380
What?

70
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,940
No, it's a puzzle game.

71
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:26,520
...and effective dream therapy while you rest in the comfort of our tits, right next to the secondary overflow...

72
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,700
Wait, what?

73
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,080
Really?

74
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,960
Thank you so much for the tier 1, 3, 1 sub.

75
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,180
Woo!

76
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,300
Can you get some break nights for me?

77
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,160
Can I get a free What?

78
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:53,900
What?

79
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,960
I can't even read the...

80
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay, who the fuck reads terms of services anyway?

81
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,600
And no one watches it.

82
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,460
No one reads terms of services anyway.

83
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,160
I just automatically signed it.

84
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,800
So...

85
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,500
Alright...

86
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,140
What's this?

87
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,020
Perception as reality.

88
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,500
Oh!

89
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,870
Oh, how did I shrink it?

90
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,030
How do I shrink it?

91
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,170
OOOHHH!

92
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,530
OH MY GOD!

93
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,590
Oh sh... okay, okay.

94
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,510
Oh... oh, I get it, I get it.

95
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,230
I can still, I can.

96
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,850
I can make it smaller.

97
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,890
Wait, can I jump?

98
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,570
I can make it even smaller.

99
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,750
Like, how small can I make this?

100
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,150
You make things big or small by changing the perspectives.

101
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:54,790
Oh shit.

102
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,650
Oh my gosh, I'm big!

103
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,970
I'm big too!

104
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,610
My thing zoomed in!

105
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,910
I don't know why my thing... wait, let me fix this.

106
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,250
I don't know why this is fucking up real cool.

107
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,690
I'm fixing my thingy.

108
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,890
I don't know why this is fucking up.

109
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,590
This is weird.

110
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,250
I'm so scoff chat.

111
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:15,770
I...

112
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,570
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

113
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,330
I went from big to small to big.

114
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,370
Yo, yo it won't let me!

115
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,730
I don't know how big is it!

116
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,470
Okay, fuck it.

117
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,270
It's fine.

118
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,910
I'll just... yo look at this.

119
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:33,970
Oh hey guys.

120
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,670
Hey.

121
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,290
Hey guys.

122
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,150
You guys are having...

123
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,530
Alright, alright.

124
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,930
Thank you so much for the follow.

125
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,470
Thank you.

126
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,710
I really do appreciate it.

127
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,390
Have a butt heart.

128
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,090
Thank you.

129
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,030
Or I could do like this.

130
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:49,430
Hey.

131
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,330
Whoa, hey.

132
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,190
Look at me.

133
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,690
It's called perception right here.

134
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,830
It's like a... it's really... it's actually interactive.

135
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,750
It's like a...

136
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:04,750
it's really...

137
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:04,750
it's actually interactive.

138
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:04,890
It's like a...

139
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:04,890
it's really...

140
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:04,890
it's actually interactive.

141
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,870
Oh my god, Treetop.

142
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,470
Thank you so much for the five gifted subs.

143
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:08,710
Thank you.

144
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,130
Wait, wait.

145
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,390
Let me zoom back in.

146
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,210
Thank you so much for the five...

147
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:12,530
Hey.

148
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,890
Thank you Treetop for the five gifted subs.

149
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,790
Gonna get some Bargnights real quick.

150
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,450
For Treetop for the five gifted subs.

151
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,210
Thank you.

152
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,610
Thank you.

153
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,490
I really do appreciate it.

154
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,630
Woo!

155
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,110
Thank you so much.

156
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,250
Okay.

157
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:28,730
Wait.

158
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,750
What was I supposed to do?

159
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,090
I was not... Oh shit.

160
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,390
I was not listening to anything.

161
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:36,970
Oh wait, wait, wait.

162
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,190
Oh.

163
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,890
Okay, so apparently it takes like...

164
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,430
It takes like two hours to finish this game.

165
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,650
So this is gonna take me like five minutes practically.

166
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,610
Oh, I gotta make the... Wait, finish?

167
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,330
Or how do I make this big?

168
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:57,930
Big?

169
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,390
Big.

170
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,610
Do I bring this here?

171
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,700
The kuzm is hilarious.

172
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:08,860
Well...

173
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,100
Here.

174
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,550
I'm stupid.

175
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,390
GrandTek, thank you so much for the thousand bits.

176
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,030
Thank you.

177
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,030
Holy shit, guys.

178
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,110
I didn't even... I don't even know what I'm doing.

179
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,590
I'm so... I'm so tired.

180
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,730
I'm so tired right now.

181
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,410
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing right now.

182
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,310
Thank you so much for the thousand...

183
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:42,510
Oh.

184
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,730
Oh, you're so tiny.

185
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,130
Does far make big?

186
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,450
Or is it close make big?

187
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,150
No, it's far makes big, right?

188
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,850
Far is big.

189
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,310
Far is... far is... I don't know perspective.

190
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,150
Hey, I draw for a living.

191
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,250
I still don't... I still don't know...

192
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,410
Did I fuck up?

193
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,990
Oh, if I look up, it goes big?

194
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:15,950
Oh!

195
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,920
Oh my god, my brain.

196
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,240
I didn't even... I didn't even read that comment, Chrissy.

197
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,200
I thought about that before... before you said anything.

198
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,400
I didn't need your help.

199
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,380
Okay, maybe... okay.

200
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,720
Look at that.

201
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,220
Look at... look at that.

202
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,260
I'm so... I'm so...

203
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,620
Oh, I can't... what is this?

204
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,260
He said...

205
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,780
Doubt that the stairs... the stairs are fire.

206
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,220
Doubt that the sun don't move.

207
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,760
Doubt...

208
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,780
What?

209
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,680
I don't want...

210
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,880
Is he?

211
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,140
Wait, I didn't listen.

212
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,500
What did he say?

213
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,320
Did I just leave?

214
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,140
Okay, I'll just leave.

215
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,760
I guess I'll just leave.

216
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,060
Oh, wait... wait... what?

217
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,690
What are you doing?

218
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,030
Oh!

219
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,510
That's too big.

220
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,190
Wait...

221
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,610
What the fuck?

222
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,890
Okay, okay, I need to be tinier.

223
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,270
Okay, yo street... wait.

224
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,710
Can I throw it?

225
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,550
Please, please my arms!

226
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,510
Okay,

227
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,390
wait, wait.

228
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,830
It'll work!

229
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,490
Please, please, sir, please!

230
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,790
Why can't I throw it?

231
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,170
There we go.

232
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,570
Wasn't even that hard.

233
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,050
It wasn't even that hard.

234
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,850
Hold right... now I can write.

235
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,570
Rotate?

236
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,190
I am so... dude.

237
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,190
What do I do with this?

238
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,410
What do I need to do with this?

239
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:29,710
Oh!

240
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,530
Can I make it bigger?

241
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,390
Wait- w-wait, WAIT!

242
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,570

243
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,820
Yo, yo, I'm gonna- y'all got this speeder in this game!

244
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,800
Oh I'm dead!

245
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,780
Crunchy thank you so much for gonna give this up!

246
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,200
Hey, I think I'm dead.

247
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,580
I think I'm dead, guys.

248
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,220
Adrien, thank you so much for hiding those rules.

249
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,040
I can't break it for the fall.

250
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,360
How did I break it?

251
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,310
I don't know what.

252
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,390
Okay, wait.

253
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,590
Yo, wait, wait, wait.

254
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,570
Maybe I can make a speedrun.

255
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:32,890
Speedrun strat.

256
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,170
Alright.

257
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,450
Wait, wait, wait.

258
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,490
Let me see if I can do it.

259
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,150
Let me see.

260
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,970
Let me see if I can...

261
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:38,970
Yeah, see?

262
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,350
I don't break it anymore.

263
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:42,550
Look.

264
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,510
It's okay.

265
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,890
Oh my god, that's a big ass cheese.

266
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,450
That's a big ass cheese.

267
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,760
Okay.

268
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,060
Can I make it bigger?

269
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,240
Breaking cheese.

270
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,580
Cheese.

271
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:03,740
I can't break it anymore.

272
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,220
It won't let me break it.

273
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,740
It won't let me break the game anymore.

274
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,340
Wait, how...

275
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,020
Wait, wait, wait.

276
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,100
Why are you small?

277
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,500
This stress...

278
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,060
Wait, why is it so small?

279
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,120
I can't do it.

280
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,760
Did I break it again?

281
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,060
Does it not go big anymore?

282
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,200
I think I broke it again.

283
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,700
It's not going...

284
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,320
Oh, shit.

285
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,880
Oh, that's a big ass cheese.

286
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,280
You're next to the wall, I think.

287
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,180
Alright.

288
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,200
It's not gonna let you cheese it anymore.

289
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,620
Oh, shit.

290
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:42,820
Wait.

291
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,840
Wait, how do I get up?

292
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,380
Okay.

293
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,320
Alright, there we go.

294
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,040
It's not going big.

295
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,480
It doesn't let me go big anymore.

296
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:52,980
Alright.

297
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,000
Okay, rotate time.

298
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,460
Rotate time.

299
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,980
Am I rotate?

300
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,060
Rotate.

301
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,660
Rotate.

302
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,120
Rotate.

303
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,340
Rotate.

304
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:05,780
Alright.

305
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,460
Okay.

306
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,160
Here we go.

307
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,560
Please.

308
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,700
Oh my god.

309
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,680
How am I stuck at this cheese level?

310
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,760
Okay, wait.

311
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,400
Okay.

312
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,920
Okay, there we go.

313
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,980
There you go.

314
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,620
I got it.

315
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,920
Hi, Dynamax.

316
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,960
Thank you so much for the follow.

317
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,440
Thank you.

318
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:25,660
Thank you.

319
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:25,980
Thank you.

320
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,860
Have a... have a butt heart.

321
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,360
Thank you.

322
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,240
Thank you so much.

323
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,440
Okay.

324
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,720
It's not gonna let me cheese anymore.

325
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,600
What is this?

326
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,500
1205?

327
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,500
Is it 1205?

328
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,540
I'm a fucking idiot.

329
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,600
It's 1237 AM.

330
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,840
Okay, two.

331
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,660
What can I do here?

332
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,720
Am I stuck?

333
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,500
Oh.

334
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,140
Oh.

335
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,780
Please, there's...

336
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,280
other door.

337
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,260
Okay.

338
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,660
Open?

339
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:05,360
A variable degree of force can and will be authorized to ensure patient safety.

340
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,860
A variable degree of force can and will be authorized to ensure patient safety.

341
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,560
A variable degree of force can and will be authorized to ensure patient safety.

342
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:07,580
Uh, force can...

343
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,380
Wait, if I stay here, does it force me out?

344
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,040
Are you booked the game once?

345
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,140
You think I won't break it again?

346
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,100
Okay, fuck it.

347
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,040
I can't be fucking bothered.

348
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,120
Unless...

349
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,500
Unless...

350
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,360
What can I do here?

351
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,170
Oh, I thought I could break this.

352
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:34,570
Oh shit!

353
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,540
Okay, no, that doesn't work.

354
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,620
Drink a soda?

355
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,600
How do I drink a soda?

356
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,720
Oh shit!

357
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,480
Oh.

358
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,150
Can it go bigger?

359
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,870
Can it go bigger?

360
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,530
Oh, bigger.

361
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:08,930
Bigger.

362
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,590
How big can this soda get?

363
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,150
Did that do anything?

364
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,950
Oh shit.

365
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,550
How big can you get soda?

366
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,070
Oh my god, this is a big ass soda!

367
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,530
I don't know what to do with you.

368
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,750
What am I doing?

369
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,770
I don't know what to do with this.

370
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,890
I don't know what to do with this.

371
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,440
Okay, I think...

372
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,920
Okay, so now...

373
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
It's soda-solid diabetes.

374
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,320
Pouring extreme thirst.

375
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,220
Okay, what...

376
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Oh shit!

377
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:01,820
Oh shit!

378
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,420
Oh shit!

379
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,900
Okay, how do I get through here?

380
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,220
Oh, I need tiny soda.

381
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,840
Wait, unless...

382
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,300
That actually worked!

383
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,310
Bring my soda with me.

384
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,330
Tiny plug.

385
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,330
Oh, my soda.

386
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,370
Oh, that's stupid.

387
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,210
I can't bring soda.

388
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,170
Is this a horror game?

389
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,530
What the fuck?

390
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,750
Oh, I'm

391
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,340
gonna die.

392
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,940
Let me get small again.

393
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,680
Oh, wait.

394
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,640
Okay.

395
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,080
I'm making this small.

396
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,120
Okay, wait.

397
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,340
As soon you will see...

398
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,080
Please don't tell me this is a horror game!

399
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,960
I was not...

400
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,420
I'm not...

401
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,980
I'm not prepared for that.

402
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,380
Uh...

403
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:15,940
Maybe?

404
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,500
Oh, you're so tiny now.

405
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,260
Oh, you're so tiny now.

406
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,680
Can I crouch?

407
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,100
Oh, no.

408
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,580
This is...

409
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,260
Oh, no.

410
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,980
No, please.

411
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:32,860
Please.

412
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,840
I can't think here.

413
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,560
What do you want me to do?

414
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,540
Please!

415
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,360
Please get in here!

416
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,580
What's that body?

417
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:46,880
No!

418
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,660
No!

419
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,220
Please.

420
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,380
Just make small and put...

421
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:55,860
You made a...

422
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,380
Okay, is there another hole?

423
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:00,960
Here?

424
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,980
Okay, not here.

425
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,280
Maybe...

426
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:15,970
Okay, maybe...

427
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,990
Okay, maybe...

428
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:21,830
Oh.

429
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,050
Why would you let me put the button earlier?

430
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,170
Dude, I'm just like...

431
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,870
I'm just reinforcing it.

432
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,450
I'm re-forcing everything until it works!

433
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,670
This game is like, Layers of Fear.

434
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,630
I want you to accept that I play it and I trick you down to Episode 3 of Nightmares for a week.

435
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,570
Episode 3 of Nightmares for a week.

436
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,250
Episode 3 of Nightmares for a week.

437
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:44,810
Oh, it should even be hot in here!

438
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,810
Oh, it should even be hot in here!

439
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,790
Oh, it should even be hot in here!

440
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,010
Oh?

441
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:50,130
Well...

442
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,070
What?

443
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,170
It's for just a size.

444
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:55,970
It's a relative object.

445
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,650
It's put a gift card.

446
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:02,030
You're using words I don't... you're using too many... too many big words for me right now.

447
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,210
How do I get this in here?

448
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,890
Dude, I'm an artist too.

449
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,270
And I don't know shit about perspective.

450
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,070
What the fuck?

451
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,610
Let me in!

452
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,230
Let me in!

453
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,190
Let me in!

454
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:23,560
This is open.

455
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,160
What is...

456
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,620
What?

457
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,460
Hello?

458
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,540
Hello?

459
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,470
Oh my god, dude, my...

460
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,550
God, please!

461
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,130
Come over!

462
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,890
I'm so fucking confused!

463
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,610
Please!

464
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,530
Give me the block!

465
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,070
Please!

466
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,010
Okay.

467
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,050
Maybe if I bring it here?

468
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,430
Okay, no.

469
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,570
Okay, wait, unless...

470
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,370
Wait!

471
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,530
Oh!

472
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:22,470
Oh!

473
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:28,790
Wait!

474
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,410
Okay.

475
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,250
Alright.

476
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:37,350
God, I'm so fucking sorry.

477
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,370
Is this the only game we've been seeing?

478
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,250
I was reading chat!

479
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,970
I just didn't understand what the fuck you're talking about!

480
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,250
I just...

481
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,910
I didn't know what... I was like, over the...

482
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:50,510
Over?

483
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,370
You stupid?

484
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,150
There's a window!

485
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,950
How am I gonna put it over?

486
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,330
There's a fucking window!

487
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,290
I was thinking, damn, my chat is so fucking stupid.

488
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,950
Can't believe they don't know that...

489
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,770
That there's a window here and objects can't go through windows.

490
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:11,730
God.

491
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,330
God.

492
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,450
Oh my gosh, I think I'm lost now.

493
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,670
Where am I?

494
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,530
Wait, what is there a...

495
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:21,870
Wait.

496
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,810
Oh, wait a minute.

497
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,730
Oh, wait, I'm back here.

498
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,750
I'm so close to murder right now.

499
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,410
It hurts.

500
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,630
What are you guys talking about?

501
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:37,990
Am I stuck?

502
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:38,510
No.

503
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,090
Alright.

504
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,310
Yo, I'm so sorry.

505
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,590
I'm so good.

506
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,610
And...

507
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,930
I'm so good.

508
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,070
I don't know how I got here.

509
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,930
I don't know how I got here.

510
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:51,790
Huh?

511
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,720
Where's that opening?

512
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,260
What?

513
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,640
Is Mabel turning on the braidsaw?

514
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,840
It is pretty.

515
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,500
It's pretty.

516
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,980
How big can I make this?

517
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,800
Do you think I can break the game again?

518
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,540
Okay, I need to get it so it's on both sides.

519
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,180
It was still...

520
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,940
No, I gotta make this bigger.

521
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,620
Okay.

522
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,820
And then bigger.

523
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,960
We need to use our noggins no matter what.

524
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,180
No matter how stupid we are.

525
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,140
Press the fire.

526
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,500
Can I take the... Press the fire.

527
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,140
There's fire alarms here?

528
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,320
...light recognition on your completion of the sign-up.

529
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:53,820
Jericho!

530
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,480
Thank you so much for the four gifted songs!

531
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,560
Woo!

532
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,620
Can we get some break nights real quick for Jericho?

533
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,700
Thank you, thank you, thank you guys.

534
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,720
Holy shit, thank you.

535
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,660
I am so fucking tired.

536
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,600
I don't know what's going on.

537
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,400
I'm not listening to this girl talk.

538
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,980
I don't... Oh, gosh.

539
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,680
Thank you so much for the follow, Edward.

540
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,660
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

541
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,480
Have a... Have a have a butt heart.

542
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,420
Thank you so much.

543
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,200
Okay.

544
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,640
Huh?

545
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,560
Oh, cheese.

546
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,760
Wait, where the fuck did cheese come from?

547
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,800
Where did you come from?

548
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,320
I'll just say enjoy this while putting together my account by anger.

549
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,260
What do you mean you're angry?

550
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,180
What the fuck do you mean?

551
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,480
Okay.

552
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:57,900
Oh!

553
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,320
Did I break it?

554
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,020
Wait, wait, wait.

555
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,460
I got it.

556
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:02,840
I got it.

557
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,520
Okay, no.

558
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,400
I don't got this.

559
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:11,920
Here?

560
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,340
Okay.

561
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,600
It's simple.

562
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,740
I'm angry.

563
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,240
Okay.

564
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:21,960
Oh.

565
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:23,880
Wait.

566
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,120
Oh.

567
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,300
Oh!

568
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,480
Why do you laugh so much though?

569
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,180
What do you mean?

570
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,720
But why wouldn't you rotate it?

571
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,420
Like...

572
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,600
Okay, and then I...

573
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,940
Okay, no.

574
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,420
That's not it.

575
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,020
Wait, do I...

576
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,380
But you seem like so happy or something.

577
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,540
I'm laughing out pain.

578
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,200
No, I'm not.

579
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:13,920
I'm actually... I'm actually so fucking depressed that laughing is the only way to get the pain out.

580
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,520
Why does it keep going small?

581
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,320
What the fuck?

582
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,400
What the... Please!

583
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,020
What the... Please!

584
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,860
What the fuck am I gonna do with this?

585
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,260
Oh, sh... Oh.

586
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,280
Oh, okay.

587
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:32,960
Okay.

588
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,040
Okay, I mean, that works.

589
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,460
Okay.

590
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,060
Just get angry and it'll work, I guess.

591
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,280
Before someone's gonna get...

592
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,800
I don't know what I did.

593
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,840
I just... It's okay.

594
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,440
I never... I don't know what I'm doing.

595
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,780
If you don't know, just be angry, I guess.

596
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,980
Now where the fuck do I go?

597
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:04,980
Okay.

598
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,440
She just makes it bigger.

599
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,800
She just makes...

600
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:12,900
Oh!

601
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,710
Did I win?

602
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,570
Just one more round and something happens.

603
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,270
Exactly.

604
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,370
I don't need to figure out shit out.

605
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,910
I don't need to use my brain.

606
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,990
All I have to do is just...

607
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,190
We won!

608
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:33,990
Woo!

609
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,830
Anyway, that was a great stream chat.

610
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,550
Wow, I had a great stream.

611
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,950
I'm so happy.

612
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,330
Crunchy!

613
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,350
Thank you so much!

614
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,630
This just came through.

615
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:52,170
Thank you so much, Crunchy, for the tier one.

616
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,590
Two months in a row.

617
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,110
Woo!

618
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,990
Can I get some break nights real quick for Crunchy?

619
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,290
Thank you, thank you.

620
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,650
I really do appreciate it.

621
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,230
How long do you think the stream will last?

622
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:01,690
What do you mean?

623
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,890
It's a ten minute stream.

624
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,770
This game is two hours long, so it's practically ten minutes.

625
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,550
All right, where do I go now?

626
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,730
Game soda.

627
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,410
Oh shit!

628
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,970
Wait, I can have more than two now.

629
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,830
If I can achieve...

630
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,630
What the fuck?

631
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,510
Okay, fire alarm?

632
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,510
Where's the fire alarm?

633
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,470
Where is it?

634
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,770
Where's the fire alarm?

635
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,410
Where's the fi... Oh!

636
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,470
Is that it?

637
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,430
Oh, cool.

638
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,450
That's it!

639
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,610
Apparently, I can get an achievement if I...

640
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,570
Oh!

641
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,210
Oh, is it broken?

642
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:00,930
Oh, shit!

643
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,090
Fucking... God!

644
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,290
Can I grab anything else?

645
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,180
The funbots almost makes it worth it.

646
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,040
Can I open doors?

647
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,360
Is how to lose brain cells?

648
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,600
What am I gonna do with this?

649
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,360
Okay, it tries to make something bigger.

650
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,120
It's like, boy!

651
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:30,960
Get bigger!

652
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,180
Okay.

653
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I'm gonna make it big.

654
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,880
All right.

655
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,820
Does it get bigger?

656
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,520
Go big!

657
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,200
Big.

658
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,100
Okay, it's stuck.

659
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,780
It's stuck on this one size.

660
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,560
Oh!

661
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:48,680
Oh!

662
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,020
Oh!

663
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,920
It's doing it again.

664
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:57,960
So, okay.

665
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,200
Come on!

666
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,440
Where's my tiny?

667
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,560
Perspective...

668
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,860
Thank you so much for the...

669
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,500
What?

670
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,120
What the fuck?

671
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:08,760
Who was that?

672
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,880
Oh, my God.

673
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,620
Oh my god this game is giving me jumpscares.

674
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,660
Thank you again, Cripple, for the $20.

675
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,700
Thank you guys.

676
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,120
I really do appreciate it.

677
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:21,920
I'm lost.

678
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,700
There's only one- wait.

679
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,140
Look at the baby door.

680
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,640
Wait!

681
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,300
Oh, I know what to do!

682
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,720
Wait.

683
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,720
I'm gonna make it small.

684
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,410
Alright, baby door.

685
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,970
I wanted to put it- okay, I guess that wasn't the answer.

686
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:54,190
Baby door was not the answer.

687
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:58,510
Alright.

688
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,190
Oh my god, go tiny doors!

689
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,840
Look at this door for ants.

690
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,680
Look at baby door.

691
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,090
Baby door.

692
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,880
Can I make it tinier?

693
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,740
Oh, why did I make it tinier?

694
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,000
Oh.

695
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,700
Okay.

696
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,480
Look at the baby door.

697
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,120
Baby door.

698
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,420
Holy fuck, you know I'm tired when I'm just fucking making baby doors.

699
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,850
Exit temporarily.

700
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,590
Move.

701
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,330
Don't talk to me on my baby door again!

702
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,030
Baby door.

703
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,250
Baby is door.

704
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:58,070
Holy shit, this is like- this is like fucking sleep deprived humor right now, chat.

705
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,550
You know what?

706
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,290
Sleep deprivation humor, am I right?

707
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,450
Who the fuck am I?

708
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,590
TKK, thank you so much for the follow.

709
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,830
Thank you, thank you.

710
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:18,410
Have a- have a- have a fun heart.

711
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,470
Thank you so much.

712
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,990
What the fuck?

713
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:22,630
What is that?

714
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,810
What the fuck?

715
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:25,810
What is that?

716
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:25,810
What the fuck?

717
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,550
What is that?

718
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,570
You wanna- Michael Strieber laughs at door.

719
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,430
Oh, that's trippy.

720
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,590
That is so trippy.

721
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,290
This is really tripping me out.

722
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,820
Yo, I did it.

723
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,900
That- well, that was really fucking trippy though.

724
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,000
Wait, do I go up here?

725
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,340
Wait, do I go up here?

726
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,660
You missed too far.

727
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,840
Oh, oh.

728
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:58,980
Oh, oh.

729
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,600
What the fuck?

730
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,820
What was that sound?

731
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,820
Michael laughs at door.

732
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:04,560
Oh.

733
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,840
I'm tripping.

734
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,060
I'm not even on this on.

735
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,280
Dude, that was- alright.

736
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,460
Okay, big.

737
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:13,820
Alright.

738
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,420
And then I do like this?

739
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,140
How do I rotate?

740
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,540
Oh.

741
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,030
Okay, maybe I'll make it bigger.

742
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,170
Okay.

743
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:30,090
Pee-pee-ma still creeps me out even though we're past the- the streets.

744
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,950
Pee-pee-ma has a cam- pee-pee- No, don't you fucking dare, Midnight.

745
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,770
Don't you fucking dare.

746
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,030
Crimble, thank you again for the- for another donation.

747
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,590
Thank you, Crimble.

748
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,130
I really appreciate it, guys.

749
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:42,830
Oh.

750
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,890
Okay, I think this was too big.

751
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,690
I think maybe I made it too big.

752
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,450
Michael laughs at door.

753
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,940
Michael laughs at door.

754
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,700
Who the fuck?

755
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,860
I have a- I have a butthurt.

756
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,820
Thank you.

757
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,900
Michael laughs at door.

758
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,300
What the fuck?

759
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,660
Now it's back to jazz?

760
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Back to piano?

761
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,740
Michael laughs at door.

762
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,140
What the fuck?

763
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,760
I didn't even see.

764
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,120
What?

765
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:27,680
What?

766
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,520
I don't even know what was supposed to be scary.

767
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,420
Michael laughs at door.

768
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:32,500
What?

769
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,520
What was it?

770
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,820
Michael laughs at door.

771
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,140
Oh.

772
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:36,500
Oh.

773
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:36,680
Oh.

774
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,700
I'm sorry.

775
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,320
I'm sorry.

776
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,520
Michael laughs at door.

777
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,360
What the fuck?

778
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,420
Michael laughs at door.

779
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,580
Every time I go up, it changes.

780
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,060
Michael laughs at door.

781
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,290
Michael laughs at door.

782
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:54,290
Oh.

783
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:54,690
Oh.

784
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:55,110
Michael laughs at door.

785
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,360
Okay, stair con.

786
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,480
Michael laughs

787
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:10,580
at door.

788
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,020
Where am I supposed to go?

789
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,500
Michael laughs at door.

790
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,780
It really shows what music can do for your mood, right?

791
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,180
Now it's just fucking terrifying.

792
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:20,780
Yeah.

793
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,560
Michael laughs at door.

794
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:22,940
Oh.

795
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:23,980
Oh.

796
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,080
Oh.

797
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,120
Oh.

798
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:25,640
Oh.

799
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:26,840
Okay.

800
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:27,980
Can't bring it.

801
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,740
Michael laughs at door.

802
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,360
Wait, why is it tiny?

803
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,900
Michael laughs at door.

804
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,500
Michael laughs at door.

805
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,600
I should just sleep deprived for this.

806
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,920
Michael laughs at door.

807
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,200
Yo, me too.

808
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,200
Michael laughs at door.

809
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,520
Wait.

810
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,760
Oh my god.

811
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,500
Why are you tiny?

812
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,700
Michael

813
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:01,090
laughs at door.

814
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,290
Let me just keep...

815
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:02,990
Okay.

816
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,710
Michael laughs at door.

817
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,640
Oh.

818
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:12,680
Oh.

819
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,080
Oh.

820
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:13,460
Oh.

821
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:13,780
Oh.

822
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:13,780
Oh.

823
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,980
Oh.

824
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,120
Oh.

825
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,120
Oh.

826
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Oh.

827
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:17,720
Oh.

828
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:18,860
Oh.

829
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,040
Oh.

830
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,820
Oh.

831
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,640
Oh.

832
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,620
Oh.

833
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,160
Oh.

834
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,380
No, I don't like this.

835
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,060
I don't like how it's being spooky.

836
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,580
I'm not even mentioning something too big or too tiny.

837
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:48,840
Okay.

838
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,220
Is this supposed to be...

839
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:59,340
I'm like, oh this is a very chill and relaxing, very fun puzzle game.

840
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,780
It deals with optical illusions.

841
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,240
Where did you come from?

842
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,480
Where did you come from?

843
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,630
Where did this come from?

844
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,890
Okay, I'll take it.

845
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,790
You hit the perspective and I'm just not looking.

846
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,150
Where did it go?

847
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,730
Didn't even need to try.

848
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,290
Okay.

849
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:36,770
Okay.

850
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:43,430
Dude, I don't think I'm solving this puzzle, these puzzles, the right way.

851
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:51,290
I honestly think I'm just fucking around and in the puzzle game, we're like, oh that man, she's so smart.

852
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,370
She instantly figured it out.

853
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:58,290
But no, I'm not even fucking looking at it and they're like...

854
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,830
Looked out for a second and it turns tiny.

855
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,620
Oh, like this?

856
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,660
Oh, it was this.

857
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,160
Oh, so I wasn't even looking.

858
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:20,730
Where's the flower?

859
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,410
Okay, wait.

860
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,790
Okay, flower.

861
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,510
Flower?

862
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,600
I'm so confused.

863
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,240
Flower.

864
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,520
Do I leave?

865
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,340
Okay.

866
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,200
Hi, Eclipse.

867
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,400
Hello.

868
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,500
Another one.

869
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,000
Thank you again for the five dollars, Crimbo.

870
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,680
Thank you.

871
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,060
Thank you.

872
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:47,860
What's this?

873
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,880
I'm so confused.

874
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,960
Maybe if I move around.

875
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,520
Maybe here.

876
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,660
Maybe the game will feel bad for me.

877
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,540
What's that?

878
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,700
I'm sorry.

879
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,000
What was that?

880
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,780
Where was that sound from?

881
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,520
Okay, maybe...

882
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,140
Maybe...

883
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,960
What?

884
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,760
I don't know.

885
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,540
I don't know where that came from.

886
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,840
I didn't know.

887
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,400
I didn't know.

888
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,280
Did you know?

889
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:30,720
I didn't know.

890
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:30,860
I didn't know.

891
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:30,880
What's this?

892
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,440
What's going on?

893
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,740
What am I supposed to do?

894
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:48,960
Oh.

895
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,660
Oh my gosh, I'm so smart.

896
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,940
Ta-da!

897
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,350
How do I make this big?

898
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,130
You got your cute little dino?

899
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,530
How do you get a cute dino badge?

900
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,930
I have too many badges though.

901
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,650
Wait, why did it get small?

902
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,370
Crample!

903
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,430
Thank you, Crample!

904
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,550
Thank you for the five!

905
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,970
Thank you, I really appreciate all the donations.

906
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,950
Thank you so much.

907
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,830
How do I get a...

908
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:55,170
Where did that cute coming from?

909
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,890
Where is that coming from?

910
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:01,990
Where is that coming from?

911
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,970
Go to the Twitch and type the email.

912
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:07,830
Refresh your page.

913
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:08,410
Go to Dente.

914
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,490
Next to the... Just go to Twitch.

915
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,090
Oh, okay.

916
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,250
That's so much work.

917
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,710
That's so much work though.

918
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,470
That's so much work.

919
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:23,670
I say it as I'm struggling to make... Can I bring this over?

920
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,260
Alright, exit.

921
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,850
Oh, I can do this.

922
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:39,770
Okay, wait.

923
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:40,910
I can do this.

924
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:43,770
Oh, wait.

925
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,130
I can do...

926
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,630
I can do this.

927
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,650
My perception is reality.

928
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,110
Alright.

929
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,410
Like this?

930
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:02,750
Am I doing it?

931
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,210
Okay, I don't think I'm doing it.

932
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,390
Maybe I was on the other side.

933
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,380
Oh, that... I just platforming easy.

934
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,300
I'm fucking... I'm the worst at platforming games.

935
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,800
I'm actually one of the worst platform... Like, I'm so bad at platformers.

936
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,300
What the fuck do you want me to do?

937
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:34,430
Wait.

938
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:34,950
Oh.

939
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:35,710
Oh!

940
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,150
Oh!

941
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:37,770
Oh!

942
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,390
Oh!

943
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:38,750
Oh!

944
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:38,790
Oh!

945
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,150
I know, I know, I know, I know.

946
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,610
My brain, my brain is... My brain is analyzing.

947
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,510
My brain... I go up.

948
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,850
I go up.

949
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,030
I go up.

950
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,680
I go up.

951
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,040
And then I do... And then I do this, right?

952
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,120
And... Holy shit, I'm so fucking smart.

953
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,380
Okay, I need... I need...

954
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,080
It needs to be bigger.

955
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,080
It needs to be bigger.

956
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,280
Okay.

957
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,500
It needs to be bigger.

958
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,860
Alright, alright, alright.

959
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,460
It needs to be bigger.

960
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,020
It needs to be bigger.

961
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,820
It needs to be bigger.

962
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,700
It needs to be... Why is it not getting bigger?

963
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,360
Okay, okay.

964
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,060
And then...

965
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,880
And then... Okay, I made it small.

966
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,640
Okay, I made it small.

967
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,980
I accidentally made it...

968
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,960
Made it... Made it small.

969
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,780
Okay, and then...

970
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,800
And I do this, right?

971
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,440
And then... And then...

972
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,240
And then... I think I'm not... I don't think this is the right answer.

973
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,040
I don't think I'm doing it right.

974
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,100
For some...

975
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,100
For some reason, I might not be doing this right.

976
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,320
Oh my god, Crimble.

977
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,420
Another five dollars.

978
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,660
Thank you, Crimble.

979
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,500
I really appreciate it.

980
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,140
Thank you for the donations.

981
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,420
You didn't have to.

982
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,740
I really appreciate it.

983
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,820
Okay, I'm so confused.

984
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,080
I am so fucking confused.

985
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,740
Okay, perception is reality.

986
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,600
Okay.

987
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,560
Wait.

988
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,680
You gotta make the door?

989
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,700
How the fuck do you make a door?

990
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,180
Look at it!

991
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,760
Okay.

992
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,720
Okay, maybe...

993
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:35,840
Okay.

994
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,120
You gotta make the door.

995
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,840
Can I take the paintings out?

996
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,460
You're still gonna make the doors and the mountain?

997
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,640
Oh my crap.

998
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,020
Okay, maybe if I...

999
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:49,960
What?

1000
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,560
How are you guys doing that?

1001
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,280
How are you guys doing that?

1002
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,970
I know it's you guys.

1003
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:06,370
Look, the other times, I would've been like, oh maybe it's my game fucking up.

1004
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:09,030
But you guys are fucking... the gruh...

1005
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,070
ah sound.

1006
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:14,770
Now I know you guys are fucking with me.

1007
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,490
You guys are fucking with me.

1008
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,340
Miss, are you okay?

1009
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,320
Oh my god.

1010
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,340
It's the donations, isn't it?

1011
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,420
It's the fucking donations.

1012
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,860
Maybe if I make this big?

1013
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,880
Oh my god.

1014
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,840
I'm getting like mini jump scares too by it.

1015
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,260
Okay, maybe if I keep making it big.

1016
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:54,130
Maybe.

1017
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:55,690
Wait, maybe.

1018
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,070
Wait, wait, wait.

1019
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:57,630
I get it.

1020
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,110
Oh!

1021
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:00,050
You're right.

1022
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:00,850
Wait, no.

1023
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:01,790
Wait.

1024
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:04,070
Wait.

1025
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:06,090
What the fuck am I doing?

1026
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:08,210
Okay.

1027
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:08,950
Wait.

1028
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:09,990
If I jump, maybe?

1029
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,070
Just gotta jump?

1030
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:14,770
Okay, wait.

1031
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:15,590
No, that's not it.

1032
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:16,730
Okay.

1033
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:18,230
Maybe.

1034
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:21,070
Oh, maybe it's this side.

1035
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:22,510
Right?

1036
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,410
Okay, it's definitely not this side.

1037
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:27,050
It's definitely not this side.

1038
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:30,410
I don't know.

1039
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:37,330
Okay, maybe if I do this, I'll just keep making it big.

1040
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:38,350
Right?

1041
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:42,410
All I do to do is just make it big.

1042
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:48,010
And then... and then I...

1043
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,430
I go this like this?

1044
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,430
Like... look at the pillars.

1045
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:56,750
What do you mean look... oh!

1046
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:57,950
Wait.

1047
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,050
Oh!

1048
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,160
Okay.

1049
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,400
I did it!

1050
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,820
I figured it out, Grimble!

1051
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:22,950
How was I supposed to know there was something there?

1052
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,050
CrispyBoy had enough.

1053
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:33,950
CrispyBoy was like this bitch.

1054
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,870
I can't deal with this bitch anymore.

1055
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,510
Oh, BabyDoor.

1056
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:43,570
Oh.

1057
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:44,710
Wait, what the fuck?

1058
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:46,690
Oh, that's so...

1059
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,480
This game was marked on one of the top 5 scary...

1060
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,380
BabyDoor.

1061
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,000
CrispyBoy had enough.

1062
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,820
He had enough with my bullshit.

1063
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,160
Now you got BabyDoor.

1064
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,420
Oh.

1065
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,240
I hate this.

1066
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,840
I hate how the music just changes like this.

1067
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,240
Oh.

1068
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:25,880
Oh.

1069
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:26,220
Oh.

1070
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,480
Oh.

1071
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,060
Oh.

1072
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:32,280
Well.

1073
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,120
Okay.

1074
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,860
Are you lucid dreaming?

1075
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,060
Have you had to the exit to wake up?

1076
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:42,780
Uh-huh.

1077
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:44,680
BabyDoor.

1078
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,400
Is that it?

1079
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:48,980
Oh, okay.

1080
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,640
All he just said was I'm fucking lost.

1081
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,240
Thank you.

1082
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,260
Thank you for your input.

1083
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,480
I really do appreciate it.

1084
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:58,800
Button?

1085
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,020
I didn't...

1086
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:06,930
I didn't know we'd get lost.

1087
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,450
There's only one door.

1088
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,730
It's not supposed to be a...

1089
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:12,970
What do you mean, Jericho?

1090
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,330
It's only been 5 minutes since that's passed.

1091
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:17,590
Oh, that's...

1092
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:18,270
What's that?

1093
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,210
What's that?

1094
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:21,830
Is that person looking at me?

1095
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:23,210
Oh, no.

1096
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:23,650
It's this.

1097
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:29,810
I was like, that looks like a person right here.

1098
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:31,370
It's just this.

1099
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:33,210
Oh?

1100
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:43,660
Oh, no.

1101
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,460
I have to be up top.

1102
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,000
Uh...

1103
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,280
Oh, what do you want me to do?

1104
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:54,540
Okay.

1105
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,380
Something would let me pick up, right?

1106
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:58,520
Oh.

1107
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:00,780
Block!

1108
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:03,380
Block?

1109
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,020
Oh.

1110
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:06,460
Yes.

1111
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,840
And then I just make it big.

1112
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:14,880
Okay.

1113
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:16,920
Big time.

1114
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,460
And then...

1115
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,840
Also, can you...

1116
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,360
You can collect the chess pieces?

1117
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,340
Why the fuck... I'm not gonna play this game ever again after.

1118
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,680
What do I need chess pieces for?

1119
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,980
Put it...

1120
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,700
You're so smart.

1121
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,200
Thank you.

1122
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:42,460
I know.

1123
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,480
Chess.

1124
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,300
It's just the penis shows.

1125
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:52,640
Okay.

1126
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,540
And this.

1127
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,060
Oh.

1128
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,100
Oh.

1129
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,620
Now they beat the Doki stream and mac and cheese at one.

1130
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,580
Dude, I actually had mac and cheese today, too.

1131
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,360
I had it for lunch and dinner.

1132
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:11,850
Baby door!

1133
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:12,990
Oh.

1134
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,510
I can't open baby door.

1135
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:19,880
Yeah.

1136
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,720
I just... It's cause I couldn't finish...

1137
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,540
I couldn't finish it for lunch, so I just had it.

1138
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:24,820
Okay.

1139
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,380
I actually...

1140
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,660
Uh-huh.

1141
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:29,700
Oh.

1142
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,440
Okay.

1143
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,220
I actually...

1144
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,080
Oh, I lost my train of thought.

1145
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:36,800
Oh!

1146
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,280
I woke up...

1147
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,920
I woke up... I slept...

1148
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,540
Oh my gosh.

1149
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,320
Please, Glenn.

1150
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:41,880
Dr. Glenn.

1151
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,480
I can't fucking talk with you.

1152
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,920
You're very ASMR voice.

1153
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,480
I'm fucking losing my train of thought right now.

1154
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,060
I like this factory hella aesthetic.

1155
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,160
So, I actually went to bed.

1156
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:58,680
Um...

1157
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,240
Um...

1158
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,920
I went to bed at...

1159
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,140
11 AM.

1160
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,020
I woke up...

1161
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,960
I woke up at 3.30 PM.

1162
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,020
And here we are.

1163
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:18,010
That's why my brain is not functioning very well right now.

1164
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:21,050
Alright.

1165
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:28,890
Where do we go?

1166
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:34,290
Okay.

1167
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:34,490
Okay.

1168
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:37,950
If I grab everything, something will happen, right?

1169
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,570
Oh, you're in the content you make.

1170
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,010
It's hilarious and so fun, but it's hurting my head.

1171
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:46,050
I'm not sure I can take part of this too many.

1172
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:50,230
Like I said, I love you, but your intelligence is physically hurting.

1173
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:52,090
What do you mean?

1174
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:54,090
Okay.

1175
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:54,810
Look.

1176
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,210
I'm so tired.

1177
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:56,830
You know?

1178
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:01,490
This is not fully the fault of my brain.

1179
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:04,210
It's also the fault of fucking tired.

1180
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:07,490
Look.

1181
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:08,630
I swear.

1182
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:09,670
I'm a bit smarter.

1183
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,690
Just a tiny bit smarter than this.

1184
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:13,630
I swear.

1185
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:15,450
I swear, guys.

1186
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:18,750
Can't make that...

1187
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,510
Maybe if I spam everything, something will let me pick it up.

1188
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:30,850
Paid actor.

1189
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:30,950
Paid actor.

1190
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:32,850
Okay.

1191
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:38,530
Something would let me pick it up, right?

1192
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:39,590
Right, guys?

1193
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:40,750
Can I pick up the moon?

1194
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:42,850
Oh, I can pick up the moon!

1195
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:45,850
Yo, what the fuck?

1196
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,010
Yo, what the fuck is on the moon?

1197
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,060
Yo, it's tiny cheese!

1198
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:55,980
Yo, it's tiny cheese!

1199
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:56,480
Yo, it's tiny cheese!

1200
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,120
Wait, what's this?

1201
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,920
Oh my god, it's a baby door!

1202
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:02,940
Oh, dude!

1203
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:03,640
Oh, dude!

1204
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,020
Holy shit!

1205
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,600
Oh my god, my mind is so blown right now.

1206
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,660
Oh my god!

1207
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:11,920
Oh my god!

1208
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,280
Look at this!

1209
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,420
Oh my god!

1210
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,640
My brain just...

1211
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,680
Can I make this bigger?

1212
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,110
I wanna make big.

1213
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,470
I want big.

1214
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:28,270
Nasa did tell us about this!

1215
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:29,970
Nasa did tell us about this!

1216
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:30,610
Baby door!

1217
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:32,210
What the... oh, wait.

1218
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:34,470
Wait, how tiny can I make this?

1219
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,790
Oh my god!

1220
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:37,950
Look at this!

1221
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,240
Look at this!

1222
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,520
Look at how tiny I can make this.

1223
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,220
Look at how tiny I can make this.

1224
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,760
Dude, I fucking love how you can make this so fucking tiny.

1225
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,180
Look at that.

1226
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,700
Chucky, lose the door!

1227
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,920
Fly me to the moon, but not like that!

1228
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,840
Omega baby door!

1229
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,580
Hello, my name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

1230
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,040
Hello, my name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

1231
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:11,580
In the event that this elevator does not wake you up, In the event that this elevator does not wake you up, don't interact with anything that strikes you as psychologically...

1232
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,400
Okay, you're so tired of what you're yelling and laughing at while you're taking baby doors or talking.

1233
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:20,020
Have you never met someone that was so fucking tired that they're so dirty and delusional now?

1234
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,860
If you see a bear in a zoo, please push them in the crease as hard as you can and immediately blow it.

1235
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,560
As there's no brain cells yet.

1236
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,500
No fucking brain cells right now.

1237
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,520
No fucking brain cells right now.

1238
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,900
It was until adopted eventually.

1239
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,160
Are you expecting more from me?

1240
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,640
You're not a true fan.

1241
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,300
You're not a true fan.

1242
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,020
Alright, wait, where's baby door?

1243
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,200
Wait, where's the baby door?

1244
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,620
Oh, there's baby door.

1245
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:50,980
Alright, baby door.

1246
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,260
It's time to be big boy.

1247
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,860
It's time to be big door now.

1248
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,240
Time to be big door.

1249
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:03,750
Alright, baby door.

1250
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:04,570
Stop.

1251
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:04,890
Ho ho.

1252
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:06,610
Are you bringing the moon with me?

1253
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:07,750
Oh.

1254
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:16,330
Dude, every time the music changes, it fucks with me so much.

1255
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:17,870
How big can I make the moon?

1256
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:18,930
Oh, can I make the moon tiny?

1257
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:21,110
Oh, look at that.

1258
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:21,910
It's like a golf ball.

1259
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,520
I'm gonna put this moon right here.

1260
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,680
It's a new moon.

1261
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:39,800
Wait, wait, wait, no!

1262
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,320
Let me think!

1263
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,640
Oh, look at that.

1264
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,360
I'm gonna bring the moon with me.

1265
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:52,900
Jimbo Lishy!

1266
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,880
Oh my gosh, this is...

1267
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,920
Whoa, Fatal D!

1268
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,000
What the fuck?

1269
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:58,700
Nani Mare!

1270
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,680
Oh my gosh, dude, there's so many of you guys.

1271
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:02,920
Holy shit!

1272
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,540
Thank you so much for all the follows.

1273
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,460
Oh my gosh!

1274
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,260
They're just so...

1275
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:11,940
getting lit.

1276
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,900
Like, what is this?

1277
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,240
What is all of this?

1278
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,420
Thank you all!

1279
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,360
Oh my gosh, there's so many follows.

1280
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,080
I'm the last...

1281
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:24,940
lit voice.

1282
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,940
Dude, I don't fucking know.

1283
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,540
Did you solve the...

1284
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,680
You were the last...

1285
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,000
I'm the last...

1286
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,960
Oh, I need to close the top.

1287
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,720
We're corrupting you with licks.

1288
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:43,120
Is it truly corruption if you like licks, though?

1289
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,720
Is it truly corruption?

1290
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,120
Thank you...

1291
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,500
Holy shit, there's so many of you.

1292
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,740
Thank you for all the follows.

1293
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,260
I can't even read it properly.

1294
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:56,920
He needs to sleep, but you're too cute.

1295
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,840
He needs to sleep, but you're too cute.

1296
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,740
Thank you, thank you.

1297
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:08,400
Dude, I don't even know if this is spam.

1298
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:12,200
I don't even know if someone is just fucking spam follows.

1299
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,690
Alright, I need...

1300
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:22,850
Oh.

1301
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:23,630
Okay, okay, oh.

1302
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:26,110
Thank you, thank you for all the follows.

1303
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:26,670
I really do.

1304
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:27,490
These are bots.

1305
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,090
Dude, I don't even know if they're...

1306
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:34,970
We're not boots.

1307
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:35,350
Okay.

1308
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:36,010
You know what?

1309
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:37,270
Bots wouldn't be able to...

1310
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:40,490
Bots wouldn't be able to fuck up their spelling.

1311
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:41,850
So I believe you're right.

1312
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:42,590
You're right.

1313
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:48,650
I feel like AIs have progressed enough to be able to spell check.

1314
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:50,970
So, I feel like we're not...

1315
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:52,910
But, yeah.

1316
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:53,550
Thank you.

1317
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:54,830
We're not bots.

1318
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:55,470
We're not...

1319
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:57,250
Thank you for all the follows, guys.

1320
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:58,350
Thank you.

1321
00:57:58,390 --> 00:57:59,790
Have some hearts.

1322
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:00,690
Have some blood hearts.

1323
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:01,610
Thank you.

1324
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:01,910
Goodnight.

1325
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,290
Goodnight, everyone.

1326
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:05,810
Yo, wait.

1327
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:06,670
Was I just here?

1328
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,130
Wait.

1329
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,170
The color changed.

1330
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:10,430
It's not red anymore.

1331
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:18,820
BBC is gonna...

1332
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:19,840
Alright, goodnight everyone.

1333
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,240
I guess it's PP stream, right?

1334
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,020
Goodnight, everyone.

1335
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,020
Coming from...

1336
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,000
BFee stream.

1337
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,700
Thank you for...

1338
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,360
Thank you for coming over.

1339
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,200
And for all these follows.

1340
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,180
Thank you.

1341
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:34,560
Thank you.

1342
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,660
I really do appreciate it.

1343
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:37,060
Thank...

1344
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,500
Oh, nice music time.

1345
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,560
Nice music time.

1346
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,980
Nice music time.

1347
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:46,580
I don't have...

1348
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,020
I love every second of it.

1349
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:48,500
Wait.

1350
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,680
Okay, I don't...

1351
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:55,580
Your decisions imply a failure of orientation, which reflects negatively on the standard orientation protocol.

1352
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:56,600
Alright, it's nice music time.

1353
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,560
You will rectify this failure immediately.

1354
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,760
I'll rectify...

1355
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,120
Oh, nice.

1356
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,240
We're wholesome to wholesome being talkative.

1357
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,180
This is philosophy.

1358
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,660
That philosophy to live by.

1359
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,860
Hello, TD.

1360
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:10,780
Hello, hello.

1361
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,160
I forgot dinner.

1362
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,820
I should... Yeah, you should totally eat.

1363
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,860
Like I said, I only had like...

1364
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,660
You asked me like what I...

1365
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,020
What I had for...

1366
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,500
What I had...

1367
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,880
Can I keep it getting bigger?

1368
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:26,960
Where did it go?

1369
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,300
Okay.

1370
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,720
Okay, I made it too big.

1371
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,660
I might have made it too big.

1372
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,640
So this is a self-read from Fifi.

1373
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,180
Who's Fifi?

1374
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,340
Is Fifi... Okay, I'm gonna assume that Fifi is a streamer.

1375
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,860
Okay, we all know Fifi has to be a streamer if I'm getting like...

1376
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:00,760
Fifi is a B2B streamer.

1377
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:01,320
Oh, okay.

1378
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:02,920
Yeah, I'm just so...

1379
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,220
I'm fucking... I'm sorry.

1380
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,960
My brain isn't working very well right now.

1381
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,140
My brain...

1382
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:15,480
I had four hours of sleep and I'm trying to figure this shit out.

1383
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,560
But thank you, Fifi.

1384
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,700
Thank you.

1385
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,820
Oh, thank you, Fifi for...

1386
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:23,040
Oh.

1387
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:23,920
Stop.

1388
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:33,370
Okay, so I have to make a staircase here.

1389
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:35,750
I have to make a staircase.

1390
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,250
And then...

1391
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,460
I have to make a bunch of other...

1392
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,760
Well, I'm not used to sleeping this little.

1393
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,820
I think... I slept at like...

1394
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:48,400
10... 11 AM.

1395
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:49,900
11...

1396
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,900
11 AM to...

1397
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,160
I used to... I... Oh my god.

1398
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,100
I can't even form sentences.

1399
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,760
I'm used to getting like...

1400
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,500
7 to 8 hours of sleep.

1401
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,220
So I'm trying to...

1402
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,060
So like I slept at like...

1403
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:13,400
11 AM today and woke up at like 3.30 PM.

1404
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,120
So I'm so... I'm not used to it.

1405
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,540
I am not.

1406
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,880
I'm so not used to like sleeping that little.

1407
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,980
It's been like...

1408
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:24,340
Whoa!

1409
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,020
What are you?

1410
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:28,660
Oh!

1411
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,480
Whoa!

1412
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,180
Whoa!

1413
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:30,700
Whoa!

1414
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,280
Whoa!

1415
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,140
Whoa!

1416
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:32,560
Whoa!

1417
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,340
I don't like this!

1418
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,660
I don't... Yo!

1419
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,240
What the fuck is a tag?

1420
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,520
There's supposed to be holes... very...

1421
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,040
Oh, it's just a relaxing puzzle game.

1422
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:47,160
A real... Not enough for me to go into a fucking basement.

1423
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,100
Beeping metal where...

1424
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,120
And it takes you to a fucking basement after.

1425
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:54,620
What?

1426
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:57,140
Professional tip.

1427
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,880
The average adult can only withstand 3 to 5 dreams per night.

1428
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:05,600
Once this threshold is eclipsed by entering more dreams, your mind will suffer an explosive mental overload.

1429
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,360
This is not good.

1430
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,040
Reorienting you for the emergency exit protocol.

1431
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,460
Okay, just making sure y'all understand I mean no harm.

1432
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,260
Just a...

1433
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:14,280
Joke.

1434
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,080
Well, kind of.

1435
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,500
Dude, I...

1436
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:17,780
Zeno, wait.

1437
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,420
What did you say?

1438
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,520
I don't even remember what you just said.

1439
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:27,060
So, I...

1440
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:27,960
I...

1441
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,720
I appreciate...

1442
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,460
Wait, no.

1443
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,220
You apologize to Jericho.

1444
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,060
Okay, Jericho.

1445
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:35,520
We're just joking.

1446
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:35,960
Okay, dude.

1447
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,780
I don't even know what we're talking about anymore.

1448
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,440
I'm just out here trying to...

1449
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,160
Trying to make sure I remember what I'm doing.

1450
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,220
Okay,

1451
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:51,160
dice.

1452
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,080
Dice?

1453
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:53,540
Dice.

1454
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:55,360
Dice.

1455
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,120
Dice.

1456
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,960
Chris, really happy to see you as always.

1457
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,040
Have fun and hang out.

1458
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,060
Oh, thank you, Necessity.

1459
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,520
Are you heading to bed right now, Necessity?

1460
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,180
Hey, Gerard, thank you for hanging out with us.

1461
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,400
I always do appreciate it.

1462
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:18,460
I think we were talking about embarrassing things that happened in elementary school.

1463
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,300
Oh, I cannot...

1464
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:20,740
What?

1465
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:30,330
Oh, wait.

1466
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:31,510
Puzzle.

1467
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:33,290
Puzzle?

1468
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:36,090
And then...

1469
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:42,240
Oh, wait.

1470
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,380
What the fuck is this for then?

1471
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:44,600
Wait, what?

1472
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,660
What the fuck is this for then?

1473
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,220
What?

1474
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:51,240
Oh, are we done?

1475
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,600
Oh, it's finally the follows are done.

1476
01:03:59,120 --> 01:03:59,600
Alright.

1477
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:00,820
Then what do we do with this?

1478
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:06,420
Okay.

1479
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:07,940
Oh.

1480
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:10,800
Oh, thank you so much for the follows.

1481
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:11,500
Thank you.

1482
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:11,960
Oh, everyone.

1483
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:12,900
Dude, there's so many.

1484
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:13,600
I can't...

1485
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:15,600
I can't read all your names.

1486
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:16,280
I'm so sorry.

1487
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,820
I can't read all your names.

1488
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,880
But thank you everyone for the follows.

1489
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,520
I really, really do appreciate it.

1490
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:22,860
Appreciate it, guys.

1491
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:23,600
Have a blood heart.

1492
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:24,560
Thank you, thank you.

1493
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,660
Thank you, everyone.

1494
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:27,380
Oh.

1495
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:37,760
Oh.

1496
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,100
Oh.

1497
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:48,800
Okay.

1498
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:49,360
Um.

1499
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:50,420
Alright.

1500
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:52,240
It's just... we build.

1501
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,360
We just gotta build.

1502
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:54,840
Right?

1503
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,280
Oh.

1504
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:57,760
Okay.

1505
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,700
I do this.

1506
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:00,560
And then...

1507
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,060
Okay.

1508
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,020
I do...

1509
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:02,720
Okay.

1510
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:02,860
No.

1511
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:03,180
Wait.

1512
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:03,880
Wait.

1513
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,240
I do...

1514
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:06,860
Oh, shit.

1515
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:07,380
There we go.

1516
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:07,960
See?

1517
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:08,880
I knew it.

1518
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,980
It's not just that it's not 200 people.

1519
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,520
It could be just shadowing to you.

1520
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:16,300
Oh, no, no.

1521
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:16,560
I know.

1522
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:16,920
I know.

1523
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:17,320
I know.

1524
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:17,840
I know.

1525
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,560
I was saying... my notifications went by so fast.

1526
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,540
I couldn't think...

1527
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:24,720
I can't think all of you.

1528
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,800
But I really do appreciate it.

1529
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,220
Thank you.

1530
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,100
Crispy.

1531
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,540
Why are you so mean?

1532
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:32,960
I'm sorry.

1533
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,920
I'm fucking sorry.

1534
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:39,620
I don't know what I'm doing right now.

1535
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,500
I don't know what I'm doing right now.

1536
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:41,860
Oh.

1537
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:45,290
Oh.

1538
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:45,670
Wait.

1539
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:46,310
What the fuck?

1540
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:47,630
Okay.

1541
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:57,960
Oh.

1542
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:58,760
My god.

1543
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,580
My dog fucking jumpscared me.

1544
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:02,980
Jokey.

1545
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:03,420
What are you doing?

1546
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:05,380
Oh.

1547
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,020
He's looking at himself.

1548
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:06,400
Sorry.

1549
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,440
My dog is looking at himself and thinks it's a...

1550
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:09,500
Uh.

1551
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:16,840
My dog was looking at himself in the mirror and he's like Yo.

1552
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,260
Who is this?

1553
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:18,420
Who is this guy?

1554
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:25,460
Jokey attack.

1555
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:26,240
Oh.

1556
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:30,800
Okay.

1557
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:39,250
Alright.

1558
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:39,650
Alright.

1559
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:41,510
This doesn't scare me anymore.

1560
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:45,990
Yeah.

1561
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:46,610
He's like...

1562
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:50,450
He saw his own reflection and he was like, who is he?

1563
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:52,050
Who is this bitch right here?

1564
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:53,290
He's looking at me right now.

1565
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:05,680
Okay.

1566
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:06,540
What time is it now?

1567
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:07,740
It is 5 AM.

1568
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,180
Oh my god.

1569
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,260
That's a lot of dogs.

1570
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:17,460
Okay.

1571
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:25,980
Oh.

1572
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:31,360
Oh.

1573
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:32,240
Wait.

1574
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:32,820
Please.

1575
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:33,580
I'm sorry.

1576
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:34,020
Wait.

1577
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:34,440
No.

1578
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:34,940
Wait.

1579
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:35,440
Wait.

1580
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:36,880
I'm going back into the light.

1581
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:37,560
Oh.

1582
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:37,860
Oh.

1583
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:38,040
No.

1584
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:38,820
I'm sorry.

1585
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,020
I'm going back into the light.

1586
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:40,980
I'm going back into the light.

1587
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:42,760
I'm so sorry.

1588
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:50,080
Jokey.

1589
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,140
What the fuck was that?

1590
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:53,740
What?

1591
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:54,420
What was that?

1592
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:54,860
Okay.

1593
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,860
I won't look again.

1594
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:00,400
Jokey.

1595
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:00,620
Fear.

1596
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,080
Oh.

1597
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:03,520
Oh.

1598
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,100
I'm never relaxing.

1599
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:13,130
I was lucky.

1600
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:14,710
Oh my god.

1601
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:18,030
I have a can of soda.

1602
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:20,390
I have a can of soda.

1603
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,800
I was talking about a joke I made about a mouse.

1604
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:29,300
Stupidity.

1605
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:30,180
Um.

1606
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:33,840
I really do appreciate you.

1607
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:36,600
I just want to make sure you understand why I mean no harm.

1608
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:36,940
Okay.

1609
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:39,100
That's okay.

1610
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:41,560
Oh.

1611
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:42,300
I don't like that.

1612
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:43,500
Oh.

1613
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:44,580
Oh.

1614
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:45,760
I don't like that.

1615
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:47,740
Oh.

1616
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,080
Why are we in the freezer locker?

1617
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,760
Why are we...

1618
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:56,000
Why are we in the locker now?

1619
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:56,860
Why are we in the locker now?

1620
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:59,300
How is this my fucking...

1621
01:08:59,300 --> 01:08:59,880
Okay.

1622
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:08,290
No.

1623
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:09,810
You said sorry.

1624
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:13,950
I said sorry.

1625
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:15,910
I said sorry.

1626
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:16,350
Murder!

1627
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:17,750
What?

1628
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:23,670
Can I die in this game?

1629
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:24,430
Wait.

1630
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:25,750
Wait a minute.

1631
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:32,050
Wait a minute here.

1632
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:35,850
That actually got...

1633
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:37,550
That actually got...

1634
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:42,750
Tricked into playing a scary game chat.

1635
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:47,610
Why the fuck does it say murder?

1636
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,310
Why the fuck does it say murder?

1637
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:51,110
Alright.

1638
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:54,690
I don't think I like it here anymore.

1639
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:57,350
I don't think I like it here anymore.

1640
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,690
Suddenly we have a piece.

1641
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:01,590
Just don't die.

1642
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:03,330
Oh shit.

1643
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:06,890
Oh I got an optical illusion myself out of here.

1644
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:09,430
Oh shit.

1645
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:13,720
Oh shit.

1646
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:15,480
Wow.

1647
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:18,240
Doors are locked too.

1648
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,940
Bro it's the weekly murder session.

1649
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,720
How did you know about...

1650
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,840
How did you not know about this shit in my head?

1651
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:28,380
Well then.

1652
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,520
Well then.

1653
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,820
You know he's here.

1654
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,420
How the fuck do I get out of here now?

1655
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,240
Okay.

1656
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:44,640
Okay.

1657
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,080
Okay.

1658
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:47,460
Okay.

1659
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,000
Oh is it?

1660
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:56,260
Oh.

1661
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:57,180
Wait.

1662
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:57,860
Where am I?

1663
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,120
Wait.

1664
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:00,320
Oh.

1665
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:00,620
Oh.

1666
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:01,520
What's this?

1667
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:05,500
That's one of the scariest brains in the northern hemisphere.

1668
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,600
Okie monkey.

1669
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:08,780
Oh die.

1670
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:11,060
Die?

1671
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:13,980
Die.

1672
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:16,780
Die.

1673
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:17,020
Die.

1674
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:19,420
Oh dokey.

1675
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,960
Why is my dog trying to scare me too?

1676
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:28,180
Okay.

1677
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:29,640
Oh.

1678
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,640
Ah.

1679
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:38,130
I see.

1680
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:40,790
Wait did you actually.

1681
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:42,510
Wait Acer did you.

1682
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:44,790
Acer did you know it?

1683
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:45,150
Did you.

1684
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,010
Did you make that up?

1685
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:54,330
Did you make that up?

1686
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:54,590
Did you make that up?

1687
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:56,270
And then it was actually right?

1688
01:11:56,710 --> 01:11:57,310
Oh.

1689
01:11:57,470 --> 01:11:58,070
Oh.

1690
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:01,570
I don't think that's diet soda.

1691
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:05,730
I don't think that's diet soda guys.

1692
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:07,470
I don't think that's diet soda guys.

1693
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:15,110
Thank you so much for the follow.

1694
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:16,370
Let's kill her.

1695
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:17,650
I do appreciate it.

1696
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:19,890

Oh.

1699
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:24,970
I got tricked into a scary game.

1700
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:30,830
A drill has a good spidery.

1701
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:32,970
Oh thank you so much for the follow.

1702
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:33,490
Thank you.

1703
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:33,790
Thank you.

1704
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:35,150
I really do appreciate it.

1705
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:35,910
Have a blood heart.

1706
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:36,790
I.

1707
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:37,830
Oh.

1708
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:40,950
Does this also say.

1709
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:42,270
Oh it's hey it's bean sundae.

1710
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:45,730
Oh.

1711
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:47,950
Oh man.

1712
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:49,770
Where did this blood go?

1713
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:54,760
Oh.

1714
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:58,420
Oh.

1715
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:02,110
Oh.

1716
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:04,510
Oh.

1717
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:08,770
Remember when I was in a children's hospital.

1718
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:10,970
In a red brain trial.

1719
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:12,470
Doki shh.

1720
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:12,990
No.

1721
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:14,390
Sorry my dog.

1722
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:15,850
Doki no.

1723
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,050
Come on.

1724
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:18,290
No.

1725
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:19,150
Sorry.

1726
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:20,850
He's scared too.

1727
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:23,270
He saw the blood and he didn't like it as well.

1728
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:24,650
Uh.

1729
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:31,220
Maybe if I go this way.

1730
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:32,860
And then.

1731
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,040
Nope that didn't work.

1732
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:34,920
Maybe if I.

1733
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:36,140
Well.

1734
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:37,740
Oh.

1735
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:43,450
Oh.

1736
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:48,810
I'm never gonna play more games again.

1737
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:50,450
Where the fuck do I go?

1738
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:53,730
Okay so he was barking.

1739
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:55,010
The reason why he was barking.

1740
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:55,910
Was.

1741
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:57,870
So I figured out why my dog was barking.

1742
01:13:58,070 --> 01:14:00,450
It was because he got his leg stuck.

1743
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:01,210
Stuck.

1744
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:01,470
Yeah.

1745
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:03,030
So we gave him like a.

1746
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:04,410
We got him.

1747
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:05,770
We gave him like a.

1748
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:06,710
Um.

1749
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:08,930
Like a shirt.

1750
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:10,250
As like a blanket.

1751
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:10,990
Like an old shirt.

1752
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:13,650
And he got his paw stuck in one of the shirt holes.

1753
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:15,630
So he was like please help me.

1754
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:19,570
We just keep falling down.

1755
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:20,430
I'm just gonna.

1756
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:23,910
Maybe if I keep falling down.

1757
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:24,850
I would.

1758
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:30,410
Maybe if I just keep falling down.

1759
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:32,610
He'll.

1760
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:35,750
Okay maybe that isn't it.

1761
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:37,230
Maybe that was not it.

1762
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:42,430
You know.

1763
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:44,770
Sometimes falling down works.

1764
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:45,250
You know.

1765
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:47,750
Huh?

1766
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,070
I'm gonna go back.

1767
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:49,970
I'm gonna go back.

1768
01:14:52,770 --> 01:14:54,930
I don't like looking up top chat.

1769
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:58,230
I don't think I like it.

1770
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:04,390
I don't think I like it.

1771
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:04,410
I don't think I like it.

1772
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:13,870
I didn't find the finish.

1773
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:14,710
I didn't find the finish.

1774
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:17,490
It has worked before in the past.

1775
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:19,330
It'll work again.

1776
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:20,330
Right?

1777
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:22,970
Where the fuck do I go?

1778
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,600
Where else do I go?

1779
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,780
Maybe if I.

1780
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:34,340
Maybe if I do this?

1781
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,120
Maybe if I do this?

1782
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:38,840
Okay no.

1783
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:40,160
Um.

1784
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,020
Um.

1785
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:45,240
Um.

1786
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,080
Maybe if I jump?

1787
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:49,540
Maybe if I jump?

1788
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:54,380
I told you.

1789
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,600
If I kept doing the same thing.

1790
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,260
Over and over.

1791
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,160
It would work.

1792
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:06,340
If you thought I was stupid.

1793
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:06,720
Okay.

1794
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,380
Maybe.

1795
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,920
Okay maybe.

1796
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:12,260
Okay.

1797
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,220
It was a fucking maze.

1798
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:17,660
You proof forced it.

1799
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:18,960
Wait okay.

1800
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:21,500
Are you still insane now?

1801
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,040
It's gonna.

1802
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:25,760
Alright goodnight Victor.

1803
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:27,080
Thanks for hanging out with us.

1804
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:28,060
I really do appreciate.

1805
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:28,520
Okay.

1806
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:29,780
Alright now.

1807
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,380
Now I just need to jump over here.

1808
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:32,700
Right?

1809
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:33,780
Wait no.

1810
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:34,440
Okay.

1811
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,220
I told you.

1812
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,160
All I have to do.

1813
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:40,780
Is just.

1814
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:43,500
I told you chat.

1815
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:44,580
I don't need a.

1816
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:46,100
Oh I don't like this.

1817
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,540
I don't like this.

1818
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:49,660
I can't.

1819
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:54,640
Man.

1820
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,220
What do you have to say?

1821
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,420
Dr. Glenn Pierce.

1822
01:16:58,420 --> 01:16:59,720
Dr. Glenn Pierce.

1823
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:02,400
And I'd like to talk more about the feelings of.

1824
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,360
Worthlessness and sadness.

1825
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:04,300
Oh come on.

1826
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:05,580
I'm already sad enough.

1827
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:06,900
You feel this way.

1828
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:07,780
Because you won't.

1829
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:10,670
Turn your volume down for this next part.

1830
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:12,080
You see all around you.

1831
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,320
Excuse me.

1832
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:17,080
And that's exactly why we're here to help.

1833
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:17,680
What?

1834
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:17,680
Yo.

1835
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,320
If you're here to help.

1836
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:20,780
Like.

1837
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:29,500
I don't.

1838
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,780
Listen don't touch the button.

1839
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:35,680
Don't touch the.

1840
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,580
Murder is just.

1841
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:38,320
Man.

1842
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:39,900
I thought it was going to be a nice.

1843
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,500
Prospect game about solving.

1844
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,740
But I'm so tired.

1845
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:46,820
I didn't think I was going to be doing a puzzle game.

1846
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:47,760
That.

1847
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,480
That turns into a horror game.

1848
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:54,380
This is going to be.

1849
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:55,780
You picked up.

1850
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:57,260
A leaking item.

1851
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:57,860
And then chopped it.

1852
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:05,540
Oh man.

1853
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:06,900
Murder is just perspective.

1854
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,560
Who would have thought.

1855
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:09,440
Damn.

1856
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:10,800
Who would have thought.

1857
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,300
Murdering people is just a matter of perspective.

1858
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,720
Maybe if I just don't look at it.

1859
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:17,520
If I do this.

1860
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:20,420
Okay that makes me more scared.

1861
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:21,560
Actually.

1862
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:22,980
You know what.

1863
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:26,500
You know.

1864
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,100
Oh my god.

1865
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:28,100
Maybe if I close my eyes.

1866
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:29,560
What if I chat.

1867
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:30,520
What if I just close my eyes.

1868
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:31,640
Just explain to me.

1869
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:32,740
I'm just going to look at chat.

1870
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:34,740
And then you guys can tell me what's going on.

1871
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:34,980
What happened.

1872
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:38,560
Oh I don't like this.

1873
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,600
I don't.

1874
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:45,510
I don't like this.

1875
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:55,850

1879
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:11,330
Oh hey there's more blood.

01:19:12,130 --> 01:19:13,290

01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:18,910
I really miss the baby doors.

1884
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:24,590
I really miss our baby door adventure.

1885
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:31,510
Our chats are always cursing.

1886
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:32,190
It's amazing.

1887
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:35,030
Oh is that a person.

1888
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:36,870

Crimbo I'm waiting until this plays Crimbo.

1908
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:23,200

01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:44,490
Oh.

1919
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:49,070
Oh.

1922
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:55,510
Ah.

1923
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:58,410
So that's who's doing all the murdering tonight.

1924
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,020
Watch out in attack.

1925
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,000
Diagonally.

1926
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,560
Now I'm a little sad.

1927
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:11,800
Now I got someone wholesome.

1928
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,600
Oh I don't know about that.

1929
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:15,060
I don't know if I'm actually wholesome.

1930
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:18,040
I don't think so.

1931
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:18,820
Well it's just.

1932
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,520
I am not that wholesome.

1933
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:22,460
I'm very sorry.

1934
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:27,980
Oh.

1935
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,300
Alright back.

01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:30,720
Oh.

01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,420
Hey look there's more blood.

01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,200
There's more blood.

1939
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,060
There's more blood.

1940
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:38,580
Oh.

1941
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:39,020

01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:48,460
Thank you.

1946
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,280
Oh that's cool.

1947
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,120
Oh.

1948
01:21:58,420 --> 01:21:59,420
It's dark now.

1949
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:01,040
Wow.

1950
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,080
Chess pieces.

1951
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,180
Okay.

1952
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:13,860
Okay.

1954
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:16,760
Hahaha.

1955
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:20,680
Let's chat some.

1956
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:22,000
Some diet.

1957
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,180
Some yourself.

1958
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,800
Additional dreams.

1959
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,220
Is this Freddy now?

1960
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:30,400
What is this?

1961
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:33,060
Am I fighting Freddy now?

1962
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:34,420
Hahaha.

1963
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,360
Are you kidding me.

1964
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,520
Oh shit look it's fucking.

1965
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:41,340
Hahaha.

1966
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:42,900
Nightmare.

1967
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,760
It's nightmare on elm street time.

1968
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:47,380
Hahaha.

1969
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:49,960
I missed my baby doors guys.

1970
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:56,660
How do I get out?

1971
01:22:57,780 --> 01:22:58,920
How do I get out?

1972
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:04,250
Okay.

1973
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:07,390
Is that how my room looks right now?

1974
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:07,910
It's weird.

1975
01:23:09,170 --> 01:23:10,270
Okay I don't like this.

1976
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:13,090

1977
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:14,310

1981
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:26,930

1982
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:27,330

01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:28,270
Oh.

Exit sign?

1985
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:32,930
Oh.

1986
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:45,180

1987
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,680
Oh.

1988
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,960
The red glowy thing.

1989
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:49,980
Hahaha.

1990
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:53,840
Oh.

1991
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:54,880
Hahaha.

1992
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,380
Okay maybe I should make it big.

1993
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:03,220
Okay and then.

1994
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:04,580

1995
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:11,710
Okay.

1996
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:12,250
Okay.

1997
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:14,910
What do you do with you?

1998
01:24:17,630 --> 01:24:18,070
Okay.

1999

Hey there buddy.

What do you mean?

2005
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:31,790
Look at how big this is.

2006
01:24:32,430 --> 01:24:33,290
Look at walls.

2007
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:34,990
I'm looking.

2008
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:36,170
I'm looking respectfully.

2009
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:39,850
I'm looking respectfully right now.

2010
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:41,690
Can I bring him out here?

2011
01:24:41,850 --> 01:24:42,230
Okay.

2012
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:43,570
Hey there guys.

2013
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:44,870
Hey there.

2014
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:46,270
Hahaha.

2015
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:49,390
Oh that's pretty.

2016
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:50,250
That's a big one.

2017
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,620
Yo I don't like this.

2018
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,000
Oh my god I hate this.

2019
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:04,780
Hahaha.

2020
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:07,140
I'm gonna make it bigger.

2021
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:07,680
Fuck it.

2022
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,280
Dude remember when we were making baby doors?

2023
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,160
I missed that.

2024
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,400
I missed the baby door times.

2025
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,200
I really make it.

2026
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:18,660
I miss the baby door times.

2027
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:19,600
Hahaha.

2028
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:26,830
What the fuck does that want me to do?

2029
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:27,630
Hahaha.

2030
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:33,850
Okay.

2031
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:39,790
Where are you?

2032
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:41,890
Where are you?

2033
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:43,190
There's no place to bring.

2034
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:45,190
There is.

2035
01:25:45,190 --> 01:25:47,630
There is no place to bring a baby door.

2036
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:47,970
There is.

2037
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:49,550
Okay.

2038
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,120
If I keep clicking on everything.

2039
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:57,700
Something will let me pick it up.

2040
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:59,420
It will let me pick it up.

2041
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,120
If I just keep clicking.

2042
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:03,540
Oh.

2043
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:03,840
Whoops.

2044
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:07,480
Oh no I made it small again.

2045
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:08,520
Okay.

2046
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:11,740
There we go.

2047
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,960
Okay I made it small again.

2048
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:16,480
Wait.

2049
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,140
Wait I keep making it small.

2050
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:22,360
Hahaha.

2051
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:25,680
Okay there we go.

2052
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:29,920
Okay I made it small again.

2053
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:30,720
Hahaha.

2054
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:34,600
There we go.

2055
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:35,720
There we go.

2056
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:38,060
Now I stopped making it small.

2057
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:40,100
I stopped making it small.

2058
01:26:44,710 --> 01:26:45,270
Okay.

2059
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:46,910
Alright.

2060
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:49,010
If I keep clicking.

2061
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:51,170
It will let me pick it up.

2062
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:53,830
Okay maybe.

2063
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,130
Maybe that ain't it.

2064
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:58,890
Maybe that ain't it.

2065
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:00,670
Maybe if I go here instead.

2066
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:02,090
No no.

2067
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:02,710
Maybe if I go through the hole.

2068
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:04,350
Maybe if I'm breaking the gate hole.

2069
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:05,490
Okay.

2070
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,600
I don't like this place.

2071
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:27,480
I don't like this place.

2072
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:27,900
I don't like it here.

2073
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:31,480
Hahaha.

2074
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:37,160
Hey this looks like a good place for murder.

2075
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:38,020
Hey this looks like a good place for murder.

2076
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,760
Like a fun place for murder.

2077
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:42,280
Look at how you can hide a body here.

2078
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:43,200
Hahaha.

2079
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:46,620
Damn.

2080
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,340
Wowee.

2081
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:50,860
Hahaha.

2082
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:51,800
Hahaha.

2083
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:54,820
This is a safe place to bring a baby door.

2084
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:55,560
Hahaha.

2085
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,700
Those are books for storage.

2086
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:02,880
Oh hey.

2087
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:04,320
Soda.

2088
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:06,880
Whoa soda.

2089
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,260
Hahaha.

2090
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,020
As long as I have a soda can.

2091
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,300
Can't hurt me.

2092
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:16,300
Oh hey there buddy.

2093
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:17,980
Hey there.

2094
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:21,680
Oh please let me bring my soda at least.

2095
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:22,460
Okay.

2096
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:24,920
Can't even bring a fucking soda.

2097
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,300
Oh why is it so dark.

2098
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:28,440
Hahaha.

2099
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:29,400
Hahaha.

2100
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:32,500
Why is that so dark.

2101
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:33,540
Hahaha.

2102
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:46,050
Oh that's cool.

2103
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:47,450
You're adorable.

2104
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:49,450
Hahaha.

2105
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:51,390
Thank you.

2106
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:52,130
Hahaha.

2107
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:53,590
Hey.

2108
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:55,570
Where did it go?

2109
01:28:56,010 --> 01:28:56,710
Oh did I...

2110
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:58,050
Did I lost it?

2111
01:28:58,490 --> 01:28:59,790
Oh I fucked up.

2112
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:01,510
Oh it's tiny.

2113
01:29:01,810 --> 01:29:02,990
What the fuck.

2114
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:06,270
What the fuck.

2115
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:06,930
How did

2116
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:10,580
it...

2117
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:11,740
Hey there guys.

2118
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:14,900
Hey.

2119
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:27,730
Alright.

2120
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:29,150
Time.

2121
01:29:31,070 --> 01:29:31,750
Woooo.

2122
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:36,220
I'm tall.

2123
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:39,680
Oh okay.

2124
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:40,980
I don't know what the fuck that was for.

2125
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:41,540
But okay.

2126
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:42,180
Hahaha.

2127
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,660
Yay I get to be tall.

2128
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:48,760
Now what do I do?

2129
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:49,860
Hahaha.

2130
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:52,920
Alright.

2131
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,220
Clearly that was not the answer.

2132
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:00,460
Alright.

2133
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:01,600
Let me make it bigger.

2134
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:06,500
Oh.

2135
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,160
Hahaha.

2136
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,120
Hahaha.

2137
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:12,180
Hahaha.

2138
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:14,540
Dork!

2139
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:15,700
Hahaha.

2140
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:19,310
Oh.

2141
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:20,890
Nice.

2142
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:22,010
Haha.

2143
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:23,850
Hahaha.

2144
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:24,390
Hahaha.

2145
01:30:25,710 --> 01:30:26,530
Hahaha.

2146
01:30:26,950 --> 01:30:28,310
Haha.

2147
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:28,490
Haha.

2148
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:29,750
Hahaha.

2149
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:44,370
You can also have all of the other but most used objects on a high shelf.

2150
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:44,990
Oh no.

2151
01:30:45,230 --> 01:30:46,670
Where did you go?

2152
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:51,070
Wait!

2153
01:30:51,310 --> 01:30:52,210
What the fuck?

2154
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:53,410
I just clicked...

2155
01:30:53,410 --> 01:30:54,690
Oh...

2156
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:56,510
Where did the knife go?

2157
01:30:59,810 --> 01:31:01,070
Oh no!

2158
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:05,810
I don't like that!

2159
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:16,390
Oh look, hey there's a hand print.

2160
01:31:16,730 --> 01:31:17,850
Oh look!

2161
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:19,490
There's a hand print!

2162
01:31:19,870 --> 01:31:20,510
Damn!

2163
01:31:20,690 --> 01:31:22,590
You spilled a lot of paint there!

2164
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:29,440
You spilled a lot of paint.

2165
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:30,240
Oh hey!

2166
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,900
Where is this blood trail?

2167
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:32,240
Damn!

2168
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:34,820
Dude, how much blood does this person have?

2169
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,380
How much blood does this person have?

2170
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:43,920
This person had a lot of blood, that's for sure.

2171
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:44,440
Ikea?

2172
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:46,540
Ikea?

2173
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:48,800
Idea.

2174
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:51,180
Whoa!

2175
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:56,380
Oh!

2176
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:02,100
Oh man.

2177
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:04,220
No.

2178
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:11,620
I got a sleep tight Mabel took out for me.

2179
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:13,640
Alright, fuck it.

2180
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,960
Thank you so much for coming to the stream.

2181
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:19,140
I always do appreciate it.

2182
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,680
Thank you, thank you.

2183
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:22,620
I hope you have a good night's rest.

2184
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,380
I hope you have a good night's rest.

2185
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:28,420
Oh, it was paint.

2186
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:31,500
It was fucking paint.

2187
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:37,440
I'm fucking this game.

2188
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:39,660
This game is fucking with me.

2189
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:42,160
Cloud insert projections.

2190
01:32:49,650 --> 01:32:51,430
I guess it was paint all along.

2191
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:53,330
I guess it was paint all along.

2192
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:55,510
Fucking stupid.

2193
01:32:55,790 --> 01:32:57,630
I can't believe you guys were so scared of paint.

2194
01:32:57,970 --> 01:32:58,870
I can't believe...

2195
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:04,410
Damn, I can't believe y'all were so scared of paint, chat.

2196
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:05,690
Wow.

2197
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:11,270
You will be quizzed to take notes.

2198
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:15,470
Oh, that's a lot of alarms, that's a lot of alarms.

2199
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:19,950
Okay, I feel like you can shut all these alarms down.

2200
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:27,700
And we can smell it a little bit different.

2201
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,760
The queen of doors scared us.

2202
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:30,420
What do you mean?

2203
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:31,740
What?

2204
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,980
I have no idea what you're talking about.

2205
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:36,420
I have no idea what you're talking about, chat.

2206
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:38,760
We'll find out.

2207
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:41,180
Don't lie in my stream guys.

2208
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:42,380
Hey Fez!

2209
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:44,440
Soda.

2210
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:46,140
Open?

2211
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:48,580
Oh!

2212
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:49,260
Baby door!

2213
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,300
Wait, let me make a baby door.

2214
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:53,760
Baby door.

2215
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:58,240
You guys hear my elevator door?

2216
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:00,160
You guys guess she's still a boomer?

2217
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:03,040
Wait, how does that make me a boomer?

2218
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:06,460
How does that even make me a boomer?

2219
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:13,380
Baby door.

2220
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:13,600
Baby door returns.

2221
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:25,640
I'm having a good time.

2222
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,140
I keep making doors?

2223
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:34,320
Oh my god, how many doors can I make?

2224
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:37,740
Before I break the game.

2225
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:43,700
I'm having a good time.

2226
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:46,180
I don't know about you guys, I'm having a good time.

2227
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,200
Look at this pile of doors.

2228
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:54,100
Holy shit.

2229
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:56,000
Oh.

2230
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:58,840
What are you doing?

2231
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,360
I actually...

2232
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:02,380
Damn.

2233
01:35:03,820 --> 01:35:07,080
Wow, those are all... this is the most doors I can make apparently.

2234
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:09,480
Even the game told me to fuck off.

2235
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:13,980
The game told me to fuck off.

2236
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:14,580
Wait.

2237
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:24,440
Dude, I can't believe the game told me that.

2238
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,620
Dude, that would... you had to know.

2239
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:30,300
A Minecraft flashback.

2240
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:35,700
Is this a puzzle game?

2241
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:37,160
Yeah, it is.

2242
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:37,520
It is.

2243
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:38,940
It is a puzzle game.

2244
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:41,280
It's like an optical illusion.

2245
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:45,200
Um... an optical illusion.

2246
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:47,240
Right click to...

2247
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:48,320
Oh.

2248
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:48,920
Oh.

2249
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:55,420
I wanna do a lip-sync of this.

2250
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:56,220
Okay, I just need to keep making a thing.

2251
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:57,700
Oh, I don't like this.

2252
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:58,120
Please!

2253
01:35:58,860 --> 01:35:59,560
Oh no.

2254
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:02,620
Oh no.

2255
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:05,460
Oh god.

2256
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:06,880
Oh god.

2257
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:07,600
I fucked up.

2258
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:08,980
Okay.

2259
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:11,400
Oh, oh.

2260
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:11,940
Please.

2261
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:14,480
Okay, I just need to...

2262
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,520
I just need to...

2263
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,420
put it...

2264
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:19,360
Like, keep it.

2265
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:19,520
We are building.

2266
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,620
My brother lives near... oh no that's really bad.

2267
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:30,760
You have to get yourself tested or quarantine yourself.

2268
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,620
Okay maybe...

2269
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,620
I just need to keep making...

2270
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,200
That's the last thing I see after watching the horror movie Oculus.

2271
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:44,660
What is Oculus?

2272
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:45,940
What was it about?

2273
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:49,340
Please, please put Pall of Clocks.

2274
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:51,340
Please Pall of Clocks.

2275
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:57,800
My Pall of Clocks.

2276
01:36:58,140 --> 01:36:58,620
Please.

2277
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:00,940
I think I made too many.

2278
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:06,330
Okay I think I made too many clocks.

2279
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:09,690
Okay if I keep...

2280
01:37:11,490 --> 01:37:12,490
Okay here we go.

2281
01:37:13,010 --> 01:37:14,370
Here we go look at that.

2282
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:15,670
My Pall of Clocks worked.

2283
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:18,050
I didn't need to make a big clock.

2284
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:20,190
I'll just make many clocks.

2285
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:26,340
Apple.

2286
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:33,320
Right click to return.

2287
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:34,580
I don't think I should be right clicking.

2288
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:36,400
Apple.

2289
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:48,660
It can't be forever.

2290
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:50,400
There's no way.

2291
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:52,100
Oh.

2292
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:56,100
Wait, wait if I push it.

2293
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:57,140
Oh.

2294
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:01,900
You can't be there forever.

2295
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:04,500
It

2296
01:38:09,610 --> 01:38:10,470
won't stop.

2297
01:38:12,350 --> 01:38:13,630
I'm just...

2298
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:14,250
I'm just gonna get it to stop.

2299
01:38:17,510 --> 01:38:18,950
It can't be there forever.

2300
01:38:19,290 --> 01:38:19,670
Right?

2301
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:23,810
What do you mean Kyle?

2302
01:38:25,610 --> 01:38:27,250
I'm just trying to push this off.

2303
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:28,570
What do you want me to do?

2304
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:32,730
How else do you push it off?

2305
01:38:36,190 --> 01:38:38,010
Animate thank you so much for the follow.

2306
01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:38,670
Thank you.

2307
01:38:38,770 --> 01:38:40,790
I really do appreciate it.

2308
01:38:40,850 --> 01:38:41,770
Thank you so much.

2309
01:38:42,410 --> 01:38:42,890
Hello.

2310
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:43,130
Hello.

2311
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:44,750
Hello.

2312
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:45,170
Hello, my heart.

2313
01:38:45,330 --> 01:38:45,730
Thank you.

2314
01:38:45,770 --> 01:38:46,150
Thank you.

2315
01:38:46,730 --> 01:38:47,170
Okay.

2316
01:38:47,990 --> 01:38:48,430
Okay.

2317
01:38:49,870 --> 01:38:50,910
Did I fuck up?

2318
01:38:51,450 --> 01:38:52,590
I think I fucked...

2319
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:52,710
Oh.

2320
01:38:53,690 --> 01:38:55,150
I might have fucked up.

2321
01:38:55,490 --> 01:38:56,650
I might have...

2322
01:38:57,950 --> 01:38:58,390
Whoa.

2323
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:03,410
Okay.

2324
01:39:05,770 --> 01:39:06,210
No.

2325
01:39:06,890 --> 01:39:08,130
No, I can push it off.

2326
01:39:08,290 --> 01:39:08,950
Don't worry.

2327
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:10,930
I can push it off.

2328
01:39:11,230 --> 01:39:12,610
Oh, that's a big apple.

2329
01:39:12,710 --> 01:39:12,870
Oh, that's a big apple.

2330
01:39:12,870 --> 01:39:14,410
How did I make a big...

2331
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:17,090
Wait.

2332
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:18,610
Oh.

2333
01:39:18,730 --> 01:39:18,850
Whoa.

2334
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:24,100
What happened?

2335
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:25,760
What the fuck?

2336
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:27,960
I'm accidentally breaking.

2337
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:30,120
I told you.

2338
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:32,940
If I made enough apples, I would break the game.

2339
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,340
I think I actually accidentally broke the puzzle.

2340
01:39:38,660 --> 01:39:40,320
I make too many apples.

2341
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:45,100
I can't even tell what's the tentacle.

2342
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:11,100
I can't believe I actually broke it.

2343
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:12,880
I feel like I'm watching art in motion.

2344
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:15,860
What do I do with all these apples?

2345
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:21,440
Oh

2346
01:40:25,590 --> 01:40:27,030
look at the baby apples!

2347
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:32,770
Oh my god what the fuck did I make a big apple?

2348
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:37,350
Thank you so much for the follow!

2349
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:37,930
Thank you!

2350
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:39,670
I'm a butthurt!

2351
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:40,750
Thank you so much!

2352
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:43,310
Look at all these apples I can make.

2353
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:51,140
Oh my god look at all these apples.

2354
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:02,860
Why is there a person who creates so many apples?

2355
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:03,740
Oh no!

2356
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:04,500
I

2357
01:41:11,730 --> 01:41:13,670
almost got pushed off by the apples!

2358
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:27,460
Oh did I have to get it here?

2359
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:28,440
How did I get here?

2360
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:32,100
Oh!

2361
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:38,340
Oh I get it!

2362
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:39,100
I get it!

2363
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:39,940
I got it.

2364
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:41,700
I keep making apples right?

2365
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:45,120
Wait... did that apple just disappear?

2366
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:55,100
Yellow?

2367
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:55,780
Orange?

2368
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:58,140
Why do I have oranges now?

2369
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:01,280
LazyCaven sorry!

2370
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:03,920
I don't know what you want me to do!

2371
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,480
I'm just making apples!

2372
01:42:14,450 --> 01:42:17,590
Okay if I keep making apples it'll work.

2373
01:42:18,110 --> 01:42:18,790
Right?

2374
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:21,710
All I have to do is keep...

2375
01:42:23,730 --> 01:42:24,410
Yo!

2376
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:25,690
Wait!

2377
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:27,970
Why are the apples changing colors?

2378
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:41,000
What do you mean just go upstairs?

2379
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:48,270
Neon apples for the win!

2380
01:42:48,510 --> 01:42:49,830
What do you want me to do?

2381
01:42:51,150 --> 01:42:52,550
What do you want me to do?

2382
01:42:52,590 --> 01:42:54,490
I can't even go through this door!

2383
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:57,190
I gotta keep making apples!

2384
01:42:58,090 --> 01:42:59,190
Don't come to me!

2385
01:43:00,290 --> 01:43:01,690
Look at all these apples.

2386
01:43:02,610 --> 01:43:05,930
And your stream is literally chaotic and neutral.

2387
01:43:08,090 --> 01:43:10,750
I keep making apples and one of them will get to me.

2388
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:12,850
Oh my god dude what the fuck.

2389
01:43:14,210 --> 01:43:16,050
It's like slamming into...

2390
01:43:16,050 --> 01:43:18,570
It's like slamming into the wall now.

2391
01:43:37,890 --> 01:43:38,450
Okay.

2392
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:39,310
Alright.

2393
01:43:39,450 --> 01:43:40,490
I'll figure this out.

2394
01:43:40,610 --> 01:43:41,710
I'll figure this out.

2395
01:43:43,330 --> 01:43:45,610
I just need this apple to come closer.

2396
01:43:46,190 --> 01:43:47,110
Alright apple.

2397
01:43:47,790 --> 01:43:48,610
It's okay.

2398
01:43:48,850 --> 01:43:50,450
Just keep... keep going.

2399
01:43:51,630 --> 01:43:53,870
Just keep... keep going apple.

2400
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:54,510
Oh I can't...

2401
01:43:54,510 --> 01:43:55,750
Oh I maxed out.

2402
01:43:56,010 --> 01:43:57,950
I made too many apples.

2403
01:43:58,490 --> 01:44:03,590
I actually made too many apples that I can't make anymore.

2404
01:44:04,090 --> 01:44:05,890
How is that possible?

2405
01:44:07,510 --> 01:44:10,090
I actually made too many.

2406
01:44:13,370 --> 01:44:14,710
What do you mean bad?

2407
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:16,530
What do you want me to do with this?

2408
01:44:19,650 --> 01:44:21,730
Maybe I just need to beg you for mercy.

2409
01:44:24,930 --> 01:44:26,710
Yo I can't make this.

2410
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:33,620
Yo what the fuck.

2411
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:36,340
Oh wait I can't...

2412
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:37,720
Oh no these guys stop too.

2413
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:45,820
I don't think the...

2414
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:47,700
I think the apples want me to stop.

2415
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:49,060
Okay.

2416
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:52,620
Do I go in?

2417
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:55,000
What happens if I jump down?

2418
01:44:55,180 --> 01:44:55,760
Is that blood?

2419
01:44:56,020 --> 01:44:56,840
No that's not blood.

2420
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:01,000
Do I jump?

2421
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:02,240
Okay.

2422
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:05,000
I'm gonna do it.

2423
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:07,340
Oh hey welcome back.

2424
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:14,280
Oh hey we are back here again.

2425
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:22,850
Did I make too many?

2426
01:45:23,710 --> 01:45:25,310
Maybe I made too many apples.

2427
01:45:25,830 --> 01:45:26,710
Wait wait wait.

2428
01:45:26,770 --> 01:45:27,750
If I do this...

2429
01:45:28,450 --> 01:45:30,630
Maybe one of the apples can...

2430
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:31,910
If I jump?

2431
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:32,630
Maybe if I jump?

2432
01:45:33,130 --> 01:45:34,590
Maybe if I jump in...

2433
01:45:34,590 --> 01:45:35,590
Oh no that's not it.

2434
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:37,050
No that's not it.

2435
01:45:37,450 --> 01:45:40,750
Maybe I... maybe... I'm so fucking confused.

2436
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:51,260
I made too many... she says... I'm creating 5000 more.

2437
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:55,180
Yo, you guys think I made too many apples, guys?

2438
01:45:55,600 --> 01:46:00,720
You guys think I made too many apples, guys?

2439
01:46:04,860 --> 01:46:05,500
Maybe?

2440
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:05,620
Maybe?

2441
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:09,000
Okay, wait.

2442
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:10,400
Wait, I got this.

2443
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,220
I know what to do.

2444
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:14,760
I know what to do.

2445
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:15,820
Yo, I know what to do.

2446
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:19,840
I just need to keep duping until...

2447
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:24,910
Wait, no, that doesn't work.

2448
01:46:25,890 --> 01:46:28,650
I was like... yo, maybe if I keep...

2449
01:46:29,910 --> 01:46:30,310
Okay.

2450
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:31,990
Okay, maybe that ain't it.

2451
01:46:32,890 --> 01:46:33,910
That ain't it.

2452
01:46:35,370 --> 01:46:36,070
Wait, wait, wait.

2453
01:46:37,150 --> 01:46:38,990
Oh, I had to make more.

2454
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:41,830
The key was to make more apples.

2455
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:44,850
The key was to make more apples.

2456
01:46:46,110 --> 01:46:49,250
The key was to make more apples, guys.

2457
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:52,710
Okay, wait.

2458
01:46:53,410 --> 01:46:53,970
Okay.

2459
01:46:55,290 --> 01:46:55,850
Maybe?

2460
01:46:57,710 --> 01:47:00,930
You guys thought... you guys thought I was stupid.

2461
01:47:04,550 --> 01:47:07,970
I'm gonna come... maybe when I come back to figure it out.

2462
01:47:08,310 --> 01:47:10,110
I am going figuring it out.

2463
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:10,670
Okay, wait.

2464
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:11,430
Maybe like this.

2465
01:47:11,890 --> 01:47:12,730
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2466
01:47:12,790 --> 01:47:14,910
I got a... I got the idea.

2467
01:47:16,490 --> 01:47:16,930
Okay.

2468
01:47:17,830 --> 01:47:18,710
And then...

2469
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:20,910
Okay, get an apple close enough.

2470
01:47:20,970 --> 01:47:21,250
Okay.

2471
01:47:21,770 --> 01:47:23,270
Oh, I... oh, wait.

2472
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:24,830
Wait.

2473
01:47:25,550 --> 01:47:25,990
Okay.

2474
01:47:25,990 --> 01:47:26,190
Okay.

2475
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:30,530
Get on my... okay, wait.

2476
01:47:31,010 --> 01:47:31,450
Wait.

2477
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:33,990
Okay, then I do this.

2478
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:35,850
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

2479
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:36,970
Nope, not that.

2480
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:41,330
How the fuck did these apples get over here?

2481
01:47:42,030 --> 01:47:43,290
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2482
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:44,810
What if I do this?

2483
01:47:49,070 --> 01:47:49,510
Okay.

2484
01:47:50,290 --> 01:47:52,470
Okay, I think I made too many apples again.

2485
01:47:53,150 --> 01:47:55,470
I think... I think I made...

2486
01:47:55,470 --> 01:47:55,670
What?

2487
01:47:55,690 --> 01:47:55,990
Oh!

2488
01:47:55,990 --> 01:48:01,150
Oh, I think the game just does it because... because they were tired of my shit.

2489
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:01,610
Maybe?

2490
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:04,670
Maybe I do this.

2491
01:48:08,330 --> 01:48:09,610
One of you will get there.

2492
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:11,750
One of you will be able to come over.

2493
01:48:14,470 --> 01:48:15,230
One day.

2494
01:48:16,410 --> 01:48:17,590
Okay, maybe I go farther.

2495
01:48:18,530 --> 01:48:18,990
No.

2496
01:48:19,090 --> 01:48:20,630
Okay, clearly that ain't it.

2497
01:48:21,090 --> 01:48:21,550
Clearly...

2498
01:48:23,870 --> 01:48:24,930
Maybe like this?

2499
01:48:28,790 --> 01:48:30,290
One of you will make it.

2500
01:48:30,530 --> 01:48:31,990
One of you will make it.

2501
01:48:32,030 --> 01:48:32,090
One of you will make it!

2502
01:48:32,090 --> 01:48:33,130
I believe in you, apples.

2503
01:48:33,670 --> 01:48:35,450
I believe in you, please.

2504
01:48:35,610 --> 01:48:36,950
One of you just make it over.

2505
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:37,690
Ooh!

2506
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:39,110
Babies!

2507
01:48:39,450 --> 01:48:39,950
Yes!

2508
01:48:40,070 --> 01:48:40,570
Baby!

2509
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:46,840
Look at my tiny apples.

2510
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:49,200
I don't think this is it.

2511
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:54,040
I don't think these baby apples are it, guys.

2512
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:55,600
They despawn!

2513
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,540
They're so tiny.

2514
01:48:57,160 --> 01:48:57,720
I don't think these babies' apples are it, guys.

2515
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:59,600
They're so tiny that they need spots!

2516
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,700
I don't think that was it, guys.

2517
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,600
One of you will make it!

2518
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:12,760
One of my children will make it through!

2519
01:49:16,410 --> 01:49:16,910
Okay.

2520
01:49:17,730 --> 01:49:18,230
Maybe.

2521
01:49:19,890 --> 01:49:21,430
One of you will make it through.

2522
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:22,670
I believe in you children.

2523
01:49:23,210 --> 01:49:25,870
You touch anyone against me every time!

2524
01:49:25,870 --> 01:49:30,650
I- You'll make it, I swear!

2525
01:49:32,190 --> 01:49:34,390
I just gotta keep making more apples!

2526
01:49:34,730 --> 01:49:36,830
One of my children will make it through!

2527
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:39,330
I believe in you!

2528
01:49:41,230 --> 01:49:42,750
I believe in you!

2529
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:46,970
Yo, this is actual insanity right here.

2530
01:49:47,210 --> 01:49:50,310
You guys thought the fucking jumping into the pit was insanity?

2531
01:49:50,790 --> 01:49:55,850
I'm out here making- I've been fucking making apples for 20 minutes.

2532
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:03,610
Okay.

2533
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:06,390
Alright, whoa, whoa, whoa, look at here.

2534
01:50:06,670 --> 01:50:08,090
My children will make it through!

2535
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:16,100
I don't- God, children, please.

2536
01:50:16,580 --> 01:50:18,600
I think I broke it- I broke it again!

2537
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,680
I can't make any more apples again!

2538
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,160
Oh my god, please!

2539
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,540
How many more apples do I make?

2540
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:29,900
If one children doesn't make it, you make a thousand!

2541
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:33,860
I mean, that's what they did in the plague.

2542
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:38,760
They kept making children because the people- They kept dying from the plague!

2543
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:40,400
That's what I learned!

2544
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,640
Okay, I think I need a restart.

2545
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:48,480
I figured out why- I figured out why- How to dispose all the apples.

2546
01:50:48,780 --> 01:50:50,040
And it's right click.

2547
01:50:50,820 --> 01:50:52,360
Alright, here we go again!

2548
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:53,280
Hahaha!

2549
01:50:55,820 --> 01:50:57,280
I'm gonna make a big apple.

2550
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:01,420
I figured it out.

2551
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:03,980
I was like- I was like- Alright, biggie boy.

2552
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:05,620
One of you will make it again.

2553
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:06,500
Hahaha!

2554
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:10,700
How do I make it- How do I make you big, mister?

2555
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:14,320
Hahaha!

2556
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:16,580
Oh, come on, man!

2557
01:51:17,060 --> 01:51:18,280
Come on, man!

2558
01:51:19,820 --> 01:51:21,520
One of you will make it.

2559
01:51:21,660 --> 01:51:23,440
One of my children will make it!

2560
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:27,400
Shit, here we go again.

2561
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,440
I keep spamming apples!

2562
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:36,300
This thing can't figure out more distance, does it?

2563
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:38,380
I don't think it makes it smaller.

2564
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:40,720
No, it goes smaller.

2565
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:42,620
Wait, this apple.

2566
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:43,620
Wait, this apple.

2567
01:51:43,740 --> 01:51:44,760
This is the apple.

2568
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:46,300
This is the apple that's gonna live!

2569
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:47,800
Apple!

2570
01:51:48,740 --> 01:51:51,740
Yeah, let's just- Apple, you're gonna live.

2571
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:52,980
You're gonna live.

2572
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:54,920
You're gonna live, apple!

2573
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:56,580
You're gonna make it!

2574
01:51:57,560 --> 01:51:59,040
One of you will make it!

2575
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:02,020
One of you- Yo, this is so hard.

2576
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:03,480
This is so hard.

2577
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:03,980
Hahaha!

2578
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:09,160
One of them will make it.

2579
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:11,440
One of them will make it eventually.

2580
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:13,720
I believe in all my apple children.

2581
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:14,800
Hahaha!

2582
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:17,980
I'm so happy you're watching this.

2583
01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:24,080
Oh my gosh, how many apples can I make?

2584
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:25,640
Oh my gosh, how many apples can I make?

2585
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:27,700
Oh!

2586
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:30,680
Maybe I make it behind- Oh, I got it.

2587
01:52:30,740 --> 01:52:31,080
I got it.

2588
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:32,700
I got it.

2589
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:34,380
I got it!

2590
01:52:34,380 --> 01:52:34,940
Oh!

2591
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:36,900
Look!

2592
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:37,740
Oh no, the baby!

2593
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:38,900
Oh, oh, oh, no!

2594
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:41,800
You were the chosen one!

2595
01:52:42,220 --> 01:52:44,260
You were the chosen one!

2596
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:45,480
Hahaha!

2597
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:49,180
Hahaha!

2598
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:53,300
What happens to your brain cells if you watch?

2599
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,180
Are you watching?

2600
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:56,880
Are you watching?

2601
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:57,020
Hahaha!

2602
01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:01,220
Your cells are clean, but not joyless.

2603
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:01,340
Not joyless.

2604
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:03,700
I'm so sad.

2605
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:05,020
That was their closest one.

2606
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:07,620
That was our closest one.

2607
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:08,760
Hahaha!

2608
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:12,500
That apple was our closest one.

2609
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:13,760
Hahaha!

2610
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:13,760
Oh!

2611
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:15,520
Oh my god, I have flinged over.

2612
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:18,280
Okay.

2613
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:21,300
Okay, maybe my- Maybe- No!

2614
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:21,820
No!

2615
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:22,800
Hahaha!

2616
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:31,680
I spent so many times- You're gonna send me some apples after watching this stream.

2617
01:53:31,780 --> 01:53:34,500
I think it's time to reset again, guys.

2618
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:35,000
I think it's time to reset again, guys.

2619
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:35,540
Maybe.

2620
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:36,960
Okay, maybe.

2621
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:39,560
Maybe if I do this.

2622
01:53:48,550 --> 01:53:49,190
Apples!

2623
01:53:49,210 --> 01:53:49,950
Come on here!

2624
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:51,390
Yeah!

2625
01:53:52,090 --> 01:53:52,930
Come on!

2626
01:53:55,470 --> 01:53:56,690
One of you won't make it!

2627
01:53:56,970 --> 01:53:57,470
Hahaha!

2628
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:03,720
You can't all fucking fly into the pit!

2629
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:05,920
Hahaha!

2630
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:09,920
Physics will fucking stop you one day!

2631
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:10,660
Hahaha!

2632
01:54:11,980 --> 01:54:15,200
I'll just need physics to stop working and then we'll be fine, chat.

2633
01:54:15,740 --> 01:54:17,180
As long- Hahaha!

2634
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:21,260
I need the physics engines to stop working and we'll be- We'll win.

2635
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:25,860
This is the time to backseat.

2636
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:28,680
Wait, okay, okay.

2637
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:29,240
Alright, alright.

2638
01:54:30,020 --> 01:54:31,420
Alright, I'm restarting.

2639
01:54:31,420 --> 01:54:31,820
Okay, okay.

2640
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:34,400
What do you mean?

2641
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:35,220
Woo!

2642
01:54:35,700 --> 01:54:37,340
I'm so fucking smart!

2643
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:39,440
Alright, alright, get in here!

2644
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:41,680
Get- Oh!

2645
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:42,380

Get in here.

2647
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:44,340
Get in here!

2648
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:45,360
Oh, I fucked up!

2649
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:46,060
Okay.

2650
01:54:47,220 --> 01:54:48,380
One of you will make it!

2651
01:54:48,580 --> 01:54:50,540
One of my children will make it!

2652
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:51,220
Hahaha!

2653
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:54,860
I don't think they're making it, guys.

2654
01:54:55,420 --> 01:54:55,860
Hahaha!

2655
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:58,720
Yo, my children.

2656
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:00,900
Um, I don't think they made it, guys.

2657
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:02,820
Wait, okay.

2658
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:05,340
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

2659
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:06,400
Come over here.

2660
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:07,680
Come over here!

2661
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:08,320
Hahaha!

2662
01:55:10,660 --> 01:55:13,300
You guys will become- Wait, will this work?

2663
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:15,800
Oh my god, will you guys work?

2664
01:55:17,940 --> 01:55:19,680
Will you tiny apples?

2665
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:21,080
Hahaha!

2666
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:22,600
Hahaha!

2667
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:35,300
The tiny apples worked!

2668
01:55:35,740 --> 01:55:36,300
Hahaha!

2669
01:55:43,750 --> 01:55:44,990
Oh, I did too!

2670
01:55:45,590 --> 01:55:48,770
Oh my god, the tiny apples made it!

2671
01:55:52,910 --> 01:55:55,870
It was- There you go, tiny apples!

2672
01:55:56,370 --> 01:55:57,010
Hahaha!

2673
01:56:01,630 --> 01:56:02,490
Hahaha!

2674
01:56:02,490 --> 01:56:03,830
Oh my god, the tiny apples!

2675
01:56:04,410 --> 01:56:04,570
Hahaha!

2676
01:56:05,730 --> 01:56:06,470
Hahaha!

2677
01:56:08,070 --> 01:56:08,810
Hahaha!

2678
01:56:08,810 --> 01:56:09,240
Hahaha!

2679
01:56:09,930 --> 01:56:10,310
Hahaha!

2680
01:56:10,430 --> 01:56:11,690
The tiny apples!

2681
01:56:11,710 --> 01:56:14,710
Thank you for the 500,000 bits!

2682
01:56:14,990 --> 01:56:16,150
I love you!

2683
01:56:16,510 --> 01:56:19,010
Oh my god!

2684
01:56:20,830 --> 01:56:22,250
Oh my god!

2685
01:56:22,770 --> 01:56:22,890
Hahaha!

2686
01:56:23,570 --> 01:56:25,510
Size doesn't matter!

2687
01:56:25,510 --> 01:56:26,070
Hahaha!

2688
01:56:28,130 --> 01:56:29,570
Oh my god!

2689
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:33,390
Oh my god, tiny apple!

2690
01:56:33,770 --> 01:56:34,490
Hahaha!

2691
01:56:35,290 --> 01:56:35,850
Hahaha!

2692
01:56:37,630 --> 01:56:38,350
Oh!

2693
01:56:39,770 --> 01:56:42,090
Oh my god, tiny apple!

2694
01:56:42,830 --> 01:56:44,490
I think I fucked Tom.

2695
01:56:44,870 --> 01:56:45,170
Hahaha!

2696
01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:45,990
Hahaha!

2697
01:56:47,630 --> 01:56:52,410
Oh, we only have like- 10 minutes more to see.

2698
01:56:52,430 --> 01:56:52,950
Hahaha!

2699
01:56:52,950 --> 01:56:53,410
Hahaha!

2700
01:56:54,890 --> 01:56:56,050
Oh shit!

2701
01:56:58,410 --> 01:56:59,130
Hahaha!

2702
01:57:00,870 --> 01:57:01,590
Hahaha!

2703
01:57:02,710 --> 01:57:06,350
Oh my god, Grandpa, I hope- Uh...

2704
01:57:07,290 --> 01:57:11,190
Grandpa, I hope you have a good apple pie after all the apples!

2705
01:57:11,470 --> 01:57:11,510
I hope you have a good apple pie after all the apples!

2706
01:57:11,510 --> 01:57:11,910
Hahaha!

2707
01:57:12,030 --> 01:57:14,950
After all the apples!

2708
01:57:15,550 --> 01:57:16,270
Hello.

2709
01:57:16,670 --> 01:57:18,830
Name is my Pierce, Dr. Glenn.

2710
01:57:19,030 --> 01:57:24,650
To the Somnusculpt welcome experience, team of your care leader- Oh my god, no, you're not playing!

2711
01:57:24,850 --> 01:57:26,110
Peng, what's happening?

2712
01:57:26,910 --> 01:57:29,230
I'm trying to do puzzles, lunatic!

2713
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:31,030
That's what's happening!

2714
01:57:31,470 --> 01:57:33,430
...cutting a tomorrow can bright.

2715
01:57:34,150 --> 01:57:34,630
And...

2716
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:38,340
Oh...

2717
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:41,520
Man...

2718
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:44,720
I was bored to- What is- now I'm an apple!

2719
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:45,540
Hahaha!

2720
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:51,840
Lunatic, I'm just trying to- I'm trying to figure out- My brain is just trying to figure out shit right now.

2721
01:57:52,780 --> 01:57:54,900
I don't wanna play Apex with you!

2722
01:57:55,660 --> 01:58:01,480
Maybe after this, after this, lunatic, I need to finish this variety game.

2723
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:05,800
What's this?

2724
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:08,760
Oh, that looks nice.

2725
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:10,340
Oh, that looks nice.

2726
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:12,780
That looks nice after the tiny apple incident.

2727
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:15,120
That looks nice after the tiny apple incident.

2728
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:15,560
That looks really nice.

2729
01:58:20,370 --> 01:58:25,870
Thank you for the last- I watched a butter- Thank you, Sol, for the 10 minutes!

2730
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:27,650
Thank you.

2731
01:58:27,870 --> 01:58:30,250
I'm gonna have nightmares about the apple now.

2732
01:58:30,250 --> 01:58:31,310
Thank you for the laughs.

2733
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:33,190
I watched a butterfinger for this.

2734
01:58:33,330 --> 01:58:35,490
I'm glad you enjoyed the stream.

2735
01:58:35,970 --> 01:58:36,890
Oh, that's nice.

2736
01:58:37,150 --> 01:58:38,290
Oh, that's not nice.

2737
01:58:38,630 --> 01:58:39,110
Hahaha!

2738
01:58:42,830 --> 01:58:43,390
Hello.

2739
01:58:43,510 --> 01:58:45,590
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

2740
01:58:46,170 --> 01:58:52,010
This is a notification that you have reappeared on our monitoring system after a premiere of your episode.

2741
01:58:52,530 --> 01:58:55,950
Please continue to do whatever you did most recently.

2742
01:58:55,950 --> 01:58:57,630
Please continue to do whatever you did most recently.

2743
01:58:57,630 --> 01:58:58,390
Hello.

2744
01:59:00,850 --> 01:59:01,370
What?

2745
01:59:02,050 --> 01:59:03,170
About to head out?

2746
01:59:03,230 --> 01:59:05,330
The tiny apple is the one that did it for me.

2747
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:09,050
Oh, we're back here again.

2748
01:59:09,150 --> 01:59:09,970
Dream Soda.

2749
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:12,270
Oh!

2750
01:59:14,330 --> 01:59:16,010
Why is it getting darker?

2751
01:59:17,870 --> 01:59:19,490
Oh, cause I'm gonna fall.

2752
01:59:20,150 --> 01:59:20,670
Oh.

2753
01:59:21,910 --> 01:59:22,730
Hey there.

2754
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:24,450
It's a house.

2755
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:31,900
Whoa!

2756
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:33,680
How big can I make the house?

2757
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:41,840
The victorious tiny apple should have a name.

2758
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:42,580
Hahaha!

2759
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:45,380
Oh, did I make it too...

2760
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:46,420
Oh, I made it too big.

2761
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,480
Alright, time to make you small.

2762
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:51,040
Small?

2763
01:59:51,420 --> 01:59:51,880
Oh.

2764
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:56,420
Oh, too small.

2765
01:59:56,740 --> 01:59:57,440
Too small.

2766
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:01,860
Are you done?

2767
02:00:02,060 --> 02:00:03,320
No, are you talking?

2768
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:04,980
Good night, malicious.

2769
02:00:05,980 --> 02:00:07,380
Are you heading to bed?

2770
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:08,380
Are you...

2771
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:12,740
Are you saying good night to someone else?

2772
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:13,220
Hahaha!

2773
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:18,280
Oh, hey Ruby.

2774
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:19,420
Welcome back, Ruby.

2775
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:20,660
Tiny.

2776
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:26,730
Is this too big?

2777
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:32,720
Oh, tiny.

2778
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:40,580
Alright, wait.

2779
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:41,880
Alright.

2780
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:45,600
I need to make this bigger.

2781
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:48,900
And then...

2782
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:49,200
Oh.

2783
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:52,450
This needs to be big.

2784
02:00:53,770 --> 02:00:54,810
Oh, wait, no.

2785
02:01:02,020 --> 02:01:03,000
Okay, there we go.

2786
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:05,560
Okay, no, not yet.

2787
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:06,640
This needs to be bigger.

2788
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:08,280
It needs to be bigger!

2789
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,340
Oh, that is really big.

2790
02:01:13,620 --> 02:01:14,020
Hahaha!

2791
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:16,660
Now I should fit.

2792
02:01:21,490 --> 02:01:21,990
Wait, I'm not done yet.

2793
02:01:22,010 --> 02:01:22,250
Whiskey!

2794
02:01:23,470 --> 02:01:25,450
Whiskey, thank you so much for the raid!

2795
02:01:25,970 --> 02:01:26,830
Hi everyone!

2796
02:01:27,350 --> 02:01:27,810
Hello!

2797
02:01:28,070 --> 02:01:30,470
Is everyone coming from Whiskey's stream?

2798
02:01:31,010 --> 02:01:31,810
Hello, hello!

2799
02:01:32,330 --> 02:01:34,850
Thank you so much for the follows, iFurBlades.

2800
02:01:34,930 --> 02:01:35,570
Thank you, thank you.

2801
02:01:35,650 --> 02:01:38,070
What were you streaming, Whiskey?

2802
02:01:38,270 --> 02:01:39,410
Oh, Demon's Souls!

2803
02:01:40,050 --> 02:01:40,910
Holy sh...

2804
02:01:40,910 --> 02:01:42,790
I think I played Demon's Souls.

2805
02:01:43,890 --> 02:01:45,650
No, Bloodborne.

2806
02:01:45,690 --> 02:01:48,190
I don't think I've ever played Demon's Souls.

2807
02:01:48,190 --> 02:01:48,670
Hahaha!

2808
02:01:49,590 --> 02:01:51,410
Thank you so much for the follows, different ways.

2809
02:01:51,630 --> 02:01:52,230
Thank you, thank you.

2810
02:01:52,350 --> 02:01:54,010
Have a... have a bloodhurt.

2811
02:01:54,070 --> 02:01:54,950
Thank you so much.

2812
02:01:55,070 --> 02:01:57,810
Yeah, I'm playing super, super limit on my brain.

2813
02:01:57,870 --> 02:02:02,130
I got stuck on the apple part for like 20 minutes.

2814
02:02:02,670 --> 02:02:03,030
Hahaha!

2815
02:02:04,930 --> 02:02:06,030
I had a fun...

2816
02:02:06,030 --> 02:02:08,390
I had a fun time playing Demon's...

2817
02:02:10,430 --> 02:02:12,350
Thank you so much for the follows, Simon.

2818
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:13,150
Thank you, thank you.

2819
02:02:13,210 --> 02:02:15,230
Have a... have a bloodhurt.

2820
02:02:15,290 --> 02:02:15,990
Thank you so much.

2821
02:02:16,010 --> 02:02:18,930
For those of you who don't know, I'm usually an emote artist.

2822
02:02:20,230 --> 02:02:21,890
But sometimes... today's Variety Friday.

2823
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:24,150
So I'm playing variety games right now.

2824
02:02:24,290 --> 02:02:26,030
Playing some super...

2825
02:02:26,030 --> 02:02:27,550
uh... super liminal.

2826
02:02:29,010 --> 02:02:29,990
And... and...

2827
02:02:29,990 --> 02:02:31,170
I am doing very well.

2828
02:02:31,270 --> 02:02:32,930
If you guys ask chat.

2829
02:02:33,110 --> 02:02:36,750
I'm already 10 minutes... I played this game for 10 minutes already.

2830
02:02:37,030 --> 02:02:38,490
And I'm already 80% done.

2831
02:02:38,770 --> 02:02:40,010
Isn't that crazy, guys?

2832
02:02:40,310 --> 02:02:42,170
Uh, don't believe what the timestamp says.

2833
02:02:42,290 --> 02:02:44,050
I'm actually... I'm actually like...

2834
02:02:44,050 --> 02:02:46,470
20 minutes... I'm 10 minutes into the game.

2835
02:02:46,910 --> 02:02:48,190
10 minutes into the game.

2836
02:02:48,250 --> 02:02:48,930
I'm almost done.

2837
02:02:50,490 --> 02:02:51,770
Oh, I don't like this.

2838
02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:54,170
Oh, I don't like this.

2839
02:02:56,170 --> 02:02:57,430
Are we in the...

2840
02:02:57,430 --> 02:02:58,930
Oh, is it murder again?

2841
02:02:59,450 --> 02:03:01,750
Oh, come on.

2842
02:03:02,170 --> 02:03:02,450
Oh, come on.

2843
02:03:03,810 --> 02:03:04,570
Are we getting murdered again?

2844
02:03:04,570 --> 02:03:06,530
Are we getting murdered again?

2845
02:03:06,990 --> 02:03:10,350
But yeah, if you guys don't know, I was the one that did...

2846
02:03:10,350 --> 02:03:11,770
I was the one that did...

2847
02:03:11,770 --> 02:03:13,170
Whiskey's Halloween emote.

2848
02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:17,250
Everything should have now reverted to being soothing and therapeutic.

2849
02:03:18,090 --> 02:03:20,210
Everything should have now reverted to being soothing and therapeutic.

2850
02:03:20,210 --> 02:03:22,250
You may be receiving this message in error.

2851
02:03:23,390 --> 02:03:26,140
Oh, house.

2852
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:27,940
Oh.

2853
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:29,080
Oh.

2854
02:03:33,530 --> 02:03:34,990
Oh, I'm so smart.

2855
02:03:35,050 --> 02:03:35,550
Look at this.

2856
02:03:36,190 --> 02:03:36,830
Boom.

2857
02:03:37,410 --> 02:03:38,370
Look at that.

2858
02:03:40,430 --> 02:03:41,370
Look at that.

2859
02:03:41,610 --> 02:03:42,810
You thought... you thought...

2860
02:03:42,810 --> 02:03:46,170
After conquering apples, nothing can hurt me now.

2861
02:03:46,970 --> 02:03:47,610
Nothing.

2862
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:51,910
I've conquered the apples.

2863
02:03:52,290 --> 02:03:52,930
Now...

2864
02:03:54,330 --> 02:03:56,550
Now I can conquer everything else.

2865
02:03:57,090 --> 02:03:58,450
Where the fuck do I go now?

2866
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:00,930
Are you still dreaming?

2867
02:04:00,990 --> 02:04:02,970
You think you only have four hours of sleep?

2868
02:04:04,530 --> 02:04:05,370
Oh, window.

2869
02:04:15,390 --> 02:04:16,570
What the fuck do I do with you?

2870
02:04:18,310 --> 02:04:18,690
What?

2871
02:04:19,290 --> 02:04:20,290
What do I do with you?

2872
02:04:22,630 --> 02:04:23,710
Okay, I'll make you bigger.

2873
02:04:23,950 --> 02:04:24,330
Up?

2874
02:04:25,390 --> 02:04:25,770
Hey.

2875
02:04:27,450 --> 02:04:29,450
Oh, I thought it was a window.

2876
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:32,950
I thought... I thought...

2877
02:04:32,950 --> 02:04:35,410
I thought you couldn't go through it.

2878
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:44,520
I got you baited so hard there.

2879
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:45,680
Alright.

2880
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:46,580
Hello.

2881
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:48,840
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

2882
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:53,280
And I'd like to read you my favorite inspirational quote by me.

2883
02:04:54,240 --> 02:04:57,320
The worst thing you can do is focus on negativity.

2884
02:04:57,680 --> 02:04:58,000
Oh.

2885
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:58,020
Okay.

2886
02:04:58,260 --> 02:05:00,300
It won't spare you from the cage of death...

2887
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:01,260
Why are you tiny?

2888
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:03,060
Why are you tiny?

2889
02:05:04,460 --> 02:05:05,940
...the old shell of sheep's nature...

2890
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:06,520
Why are you tiny?

2891
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:09,560
...and the eventual loss of everything you've ever held dear.

2892
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:10,220
Okay, okay.

2893
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:12,880
Whatever you do, don't focus on that.

2894
02:05:13,300 --> 02:05:13,760
Thank you.

2895
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:16,340
Alright, now you're big.

2896
02:05:16,900 --> 02:05:17,380
Nice.

2897
02:05:20,080 --> 02:05:21,600
Okay, now you make you bigger.

2898
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:22,360
Apparently.

2899
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:25,280
Okay.

2900
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:26,320
Here we go.

2901
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:27,280
Alright.

2902
02:05:27,780 --> 02:05:28,260
Okay.

2903
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:30,200
Apparently you're not getting any bigger.

2904
02:05:30,620 --> 02:05:32,180
So I gotta put you higher.

2905
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:37,980
Okay, now you're big.

2906
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:39,560
Oh, I think that's too big.

2907
02:05:42,620 --> 02:05:44,320
Okay, how the fuck do I get in?

2908
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:44,720
No.

2909
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:47,260
Okay.

2910
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:48,320
Oh, there we go.

2911
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:48,740
There we go.

2912
02:05:50,140 --> 02:05:51,000
See, look at that.

2913
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:51,560
I'm a genius.

2914
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:53,940
Oh, why is there a vent?

2915
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:55,840
Oh, I don't like this.

2916
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:57,540
Now I'm in a vent?

2917
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:00,480
What?

2918
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:01,460
Oh.

2919
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:03,000
Hey there.

2920
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:04,620
...

2921
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:06,760
Oh.

2922
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:07,420
Oh, baby.

2923
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:08,360
Oh.

2924
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:09,360
Oh, baby.

2925
02:06:10,230 --> 02:06:10,520
Oh.

2926
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:11,720
Baby?

2927
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:13,420
Oh?

2928
02:06:14,160 --> 02:06:15,300
What do I do with you?

2929
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,600
I still don't know.

2930
02:06:21,820 --> 02:06:22,780
I still don't know.

2931
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:24,640
I pretended to understand.

2932
02:06:25,480 --> 02:06:26,420
Wait, wait.

2933
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:27,660
Oh!

2934
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,400
I'm so smart!

2935
02:06:31,900 --> 02:06:34,060
Why am I so- I'm so tiny!

2936
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:39,360
I'm so slow!

2937
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:43,320
Baby.

2938
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:45,200
Now I'm baby.

2939
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:47,740
Oh my god, I'm so fucking slow now.

2940
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:50,720
Your laugh is adorable.

2941
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:51,800
Oh, thank you.

2942
02:06:52,700 --> 02:06:54,180
What the fuck happened?

2943
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:58,340
I'm baby now.

2944
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:00,080
I think I broke the gate.

2945
02:07:02,060 --> 02:07:03,820
Aina, thank you so much for the follow.

2946
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:04,040
I'm so happy.

2947
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:04,640
Thank you, thank you.

2948
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:06,080
Thank you so much.

2949
02:07:06,100 --> 02:07:06,860
Have a butt heart.

2950
02:07:07,240 --> 02:07:09,160
Also, thank you so much, you soy boy.

2951
02:07:09,380 --> 02:07:10,480
And Vincent, cute.

2952
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:11,020
Thank you.

2953
02:07:11,060 --> 02:07:11,860
Thank you so much.

2954
02:07:13,400 --> 02:07:13,840
Okay.

2955
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:15,780
Now I'm actual baby.

2956
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:20,360
Okay, I don't- Okay, I really- I don't think- I think I fucked up, chat.

2957
02:07:23,700 --> 02:07:26,140
I think I actually- I think- Wow!

2958
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:27,700
I think I fucked up.

2959
02:07:28,620 --> 02:07:31,100
I don't think I'm supposed to be tiny, guys.

2960
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:33,680
I don't think I'm supposed to be tiny.

2961
02:07:38,280 --> 02:07:40,800
I don't think I'm supposed to be tiny.

2962
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:40,900
I don't think I'm supposed to be tiny.

2963
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:46,900
Luck Lad, thank you so much for the gift of thumbs.

2964
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:48,160
Thank you, thank you.

2965
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:51,400
Can you get some Berknights real quick from Luck Lad?

2966
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:54,600
Guys, I think I- I think I broke the gate, guys.

2967
02:07:57,140 --> 02:07:57,620
Wait.

2968
02:07:58,160 --> 02:07:59,120
Let me got this.

2969
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:02,080
Oh no.

2970
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:02,760
It's stuck.

2971
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:07,000
No, I got this.

2972
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:08,440
Oh, what did you do?

2973
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:10,140
I don't even know what I did.

2974
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:14,540
We helped Babydor, now Babydor is here to watch us grow.

2975
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:17,120
I don't know.

2976
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:18,700
Okay, wait, let me go through here.

2977
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:19,840
Please let me through.

2978
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:21,180
Let me through.

2979
02:08:21,380 --> 02:08:22,380
Let me through.

2980
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:26,000
Okay, okay, I need to be a bit bigger.

2981
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:27,240
Okay.

2982
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:31,280
Oh, now it's too big.

2983
02:08:31,880 --> 02:08:32,320
Okay.

2984
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:36,880
It needs to be the perfect... Please, please mister, I wanna be big again!

2985
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:39,160
I wanna be big again!

2986
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,900
I think I broke the game, guys!

2987
02:08:49,430 --> 02:08:50,990
Please, come back!

2988
02:08:53,310 --> 02:08:54,410
Oh, wait.

2989
02:08:54,670 --> 02:08:55,630
Let me in.

2990
02:08:55,950 --> 02:08:56,970
Let me in.

2991
02:08:59,230 --> 02:09:00,810
How do I break games?

2992
02:09:00,950 --> 02:09:01,590
I don't understand.

2993
02:09:01,750 --> 02:09:03,090
I keep breaking this game.

2994
02:09:03,350 --> 02:09:04,710
I keep breaking it.

2995
02:09:06,950 --> 02:09:08,410
Let me in, please.

2996
02:09:09,530 --> 02:09:11,290
Please, let me in.

2997
02:09:12,310 --> 02:09:15,270
This is actually how smart I am to keep it broken.

2998
02:09:18,230 --> 02:09:20,850
Yo, it won't even let me get big again.

2999
02:09:22,410 --> 02:09:23,590
Let me in.

3000
02:09:23,870 --> 02:09:24,950
Let me in.

3001
02:09:26,830 --> 02:09:28,190
Oh my god.

3002
02:09:30,070 --> 02:09:32,090
Yo, okay, you know what?

3003
02:09:32,230 --> 02:09:34,490
I can't even... Look how slow I am.

3004
02:09:34,670 --> 02:09:36,170
Look how slow I am.

3005
02:09:36,610 --> 02:09:41,030
I'm trying to get... I'm trying to get used to the mouse bar in the game engine now.

3006
02:09:41,550 --> 02:09:43,050
Look, oh my god.

3007
02:09:45,470 --> 02:09:46,890
I'm so slow.

3008
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:51,830
Holy shit.

3009
02:09:52,390 --> 02:09:55,010
I don't think I was supposed to be this tiny, guys.

3010
02:09:55,490 --> 02:09:57,550
I don't think I'm supposed to be this tiny.

3011
02:10:01,170 --> 02:10:01,610
Okay.

3012
02:10:01,610 --> 02:10:02,490
Okay, don't worry.

3013
02:10:02,710 --> 02:10:03,870
I'm not restarting.

3014
02:10:03,870 --> 02:10:05,050
I'm not restarting.

3015
02:10:06,990 --> 02:10:08,090
Alright, alright, alright.

3016
02:10:08,590 --> 02:10:10,330
I just need to... Please.

3017
02:10:10,610 --> 02:10:11,530
Please, mister.

3018
02:10:11,790 --> 02:10:12,350
Please.

3019
02:10:12,450 --> 02:10:12,730
Whoa!

3020
02:10:13,970 --> 02:10:17,070
He walked through.

3021
02:10:19,550 --> 02:10:20,110
Whoa!

3022
02:10:20,190 --> 02:10:21,150
Where did he go?

3023
02:10:21,770 --> 02:10:25,900
Oh, now it's gone forever.

3024
02:10:29,140 --> 02:10:31,780
Oh, it's gone forever now.

3025
02:10:32,780 --> 02:10:33,340
No.

3026
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:34,920
Alright.

3027
02:10:35,200 --> 02:10:37,240
Okay, if I walk through that door...

3028
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:38,980
Okay, he's like...

3029
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:41,380
No, I'm gonna...

3030
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:49,620
If I go through this big door, I just need to make it through, guys.

3031
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:53,660
I just... I just need to make it through.

3032
02:10:58,540 --> 02:10:59,800
Oh my god.

3033
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:02,620
I wish there was a sprint button now.

3034
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:05,280
I wish I was...

3035
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:07,560
Oh, we're almost there, guys.

3036
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:08,840
We're almost there.

3037
02:11:10,940 --> 02:11:13,220
Where is this door gonna lead us now?

3038
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:16,960
We're so close, chat.

3039
02:11:18,820 --> 02:11:20,120
We're so close.

3040
02:11:27,820 --> 02:11:29,220
Oh my god.

3041
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:30,240
We're almost there.

3042
02:11:30,660 --> 02:11:33,040
I think our domain has gone before.

3043
02:11:33,240 --> 02:11:35,420
Where is it gonna lead us?

3044
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:37,620
The door is closed.

3045
02:11:37,940 --> 02:11:38,180
I'm...

3046
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:40,860
Wouldn't it be great if we went out of bounds after this?

3047
02:11:43,960 --> 02:11:45,640
Dude, is this Ant-Man?

3048
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:47,720
Are we in an Ant-Man film right now?

3049
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:48,560
Alright.

3050
02:11:48,620 --> 02:11:49,120
Oh my god.

3051
02:11:49,140 --> 02:11:50,360
Look at the... The door is...

3052
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:52,500
The door is not... The door doesn't know where it's leading us.

3053
02:11:52,740 --> 02:11:53,640
Oh my god.

3054
02:11:54,940 --> 02:11:56,760
Even the door doesn't know.

3055
02:11:58,660 --> 02:11:59,860
Oh my god.

3056
02:11:59,860 --> 02:12:00,760
You can see that?

3057
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:04,220
Wait, I'm not even... I'm too small.

3058
02:12:04,620 --> 02:12:06,680
I'm too small to jump in the door.

3059
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:09,820
I'm too small to jump in the door.

3060
02:12:12,260 --> 02:12:14,440
It won't even let me in.

3061
02:12:14,580 --> 02:12:15,620
I'm too small.

3062
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:17,400
Please.

3063
02:12:17,860 --> 02:12:19,320
Please let me in.

3064
02:12:21,460 --> 02:12:22,700
I'm too baby.

3065
02:12:27,180 --> 02:12:28,240
And we clip through.

3066
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:29,720
Alright, time to clip through, guys.

3067
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:35,580
I think we have... I think... I think we gotta come back to the checkpoint.

3068
02:12:36,680 --> 02:12:38,020
Oh my god.

3069
02:12:38,040 --> 02:12:39,660
Where the fuck is the castle?

3070
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:43,180
Yeah, I don't think... After traveling so far...

3071
02:12:43,180 --> 02:12:46,440
It seems like we gotta send that to the checkpoint.

3072
02:12:47,660 --> 02:12:49,240
Where is it gonna lead me?

3073
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:50,100
Oh, it's back here.

3074
02:12:50,180 --> 02:12:50,380
Okay.

3075
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:52,420
Alright, here we go again.

3076
02:12:53,820 --> 02:12:55,660
Okay, what we've learned today...

3077
02:12:55,660 --> 02:12:57,320
We've learned something today.

3078
02:12:57,800 --> 02:12:59,980
We learned that you can actually be...

3079
02:12:59,980 --> 02:13:02,520
You can actually be too small, apparently.

3080
02:13:03,320 --> 02:13:06,320
There is a way to be too small in the game.

3081
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:09,360
There is a way.

3082
02:13:09,700 --> 02:13:11,460
And I found that way.

3083
02:13:16,970 --> 02:13:18,690
Okay, I fucked up again.

3084
02:13:19,130 --> 02:13:20,670
Size doesn't matter.

3085
02:13:25,070 --> 02:13:27,590
There's a thing called being too small, apparently.

3086
02:13:27,950 --> 02:13:28,970
Isn't that crazy?

3087
02:13:29,370 --> 02:13:33,610
Who would've thought there's a thing called being too small in the game?

3088
02:13:34,330 --> 02:13:36,090
Who would've thought, guys?

3089
02:13:36,590 --> 02:13:37,450
Not me.

3090
02:13:42,210 --> 02:13:43,870
Okay, where the fuck is the door?

3091
02:13:44,050 --> 02:13:45,050
Here you are.

3092
02:13:45,270 --> 02:13:45,790
Alright.

3093
02:13:46,270 --> 02:13:48,670
And then... through this...

3094
02:13:49,550 --> 02:13:51,170
We gotta pick you up.

3095
02:13:54,110 --> 02:13:55,290
Alright, let's go.

3096
02:13:58,870 --> 02:14:01,430
Okay, am I gonna fuck this up again, guys?

3097
02:14:06,630 --> 02:14:07,690
How do I do this?

3098
02:14:16,850 --> 02:14:17,230
Okay.

3099
02:14:18,470 --> 02:14:19,550
Place it on top of the...

3100
02:14:19,550 --> 02:14:20,490
How do I place it?

3101
02:14:20,570 --> 02:14:21,190
It won't let me...

3102
02:14:21,190 --> 02:14:21,670
Oh, there it is.

3103
02:14:26,490 --> 02:14:28,670
I was like, would it be a good place to...

3104
02:14:28,670 --> 02:14:29,230
Oh, there it goes.

3105
02:14:33,850 --> 02:14:34,890
First try, two.

3106
02:14:39,430 --> 02:14:40,190
First try, two.

3107
02:14:40,190 --> 02:14:40,490
First try, two.

3108
02:14:40,490 --> 02:14:40,890
First try, two.

3109
02:14:40,890 --> 02:14:41,270
First try, two.

3110
02:14:42,070 --> 02:14:43,210
First try, two.

3111
02:14:43,410 --> 02:14:44,370
First try, two.

3112
02:14:44,370 --> 02:14:45,350
Apparently so.

3113
02:14:45,770 --> 02:14:48,150
Hello, my name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

3114
02:14:48,450 --> 02:14:54,670
And I'd like to thank you for triggering every single one of our 823 emergency protocols.

3115
02:14:55,310 --> 02:14:59,910
This will assist us greatly in improving the system for future patients.

3116
02:15:00,630 --> 02:15:01,270
Congratulations.

3117
02:15:02,210 --> 02:15:05,050
Anyway, you're now headed in the right direction.

3118
02:15:05,230 --> 02:15:09,110
And we should be able to initiate the emergency exit protocol shortly.

3119
02:15:09,490 --> 02:15:09,830
Oh, wait, what?

3120
02:15:09,910 --> 02:15:12,250
Okay, if I make two big ones...

3121
02:15:12,250 --> 02:15:14,530
Remember what you said, you started ten minutes.

3122
02:15:14,870 --> 02:15:15,730
God, almost...

3123
02:15:15,730 --> 02:15:16,210
Yeah, see?

3124
02:15:16,510 --> 02:15:17,230
It's only...

3125
02:15:17,230 --> 02:15:18,450
Five minutes only passed.

3126
02:15:18,850 --> 02:15:19,670
What do you mean?

3127
02:15:20,070 --> 02:15:22,470
Only five minutes have passed, guys.

3128
02:15:23,070 --> 02:15:24,430
What the fuck do I'm doing?

3129
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:30,160
Did I get bigger?

3130
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:31,600
I don't even...

3131
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:32,660
I don't even know.

3132
02:15:33,640 --> 02:15:35,220
Am I getting bigger, guys?

3133
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,180
Am I doing it?

3134
02:15:37,480 --> 02:15:38,620
Oh, what is...

3135
02:15:38,620 --> 02:15:39,380
Wait...

3136
02:15:39,380 --> 02:15:40,220
Oh!

3137
02:15:40,760 --> 02:15:41,360
Oh!

3138
02:15:42,060 --> 02:15:42,660
Wait.

3139
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:45,500
I don't know what I'm doing.

3140
02:15:46,360 --> 02:15:47,200
I'm babying?

3141
02:15:56,060 --> 02:15:57,480
Hey, it's me, baby.

3142
02:15:58,840 --> 02:16:00,040
It's me, baby.

3143
02:16:00,760 --> 02:16:02,800
I don't think I was supposed to be baby.

3144
02:16:04,300 --> 02:16:04,900
Okay, man.

3145
02:16:05,020 --> 02:16:05,660
Did I get...

3146
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:06,120
Become big?

3147
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:08,700
I might get bigger.

3148
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:14,860
Okay, make me mega big.

3149
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:17,880
All right.

3150
02:16:19,240 --> 02:16:20,620
All right, now I'm...

3151
02:16:20,620 --> 02:16:20,940
Okay, I'm...

3152
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:21,060
I'm gonna do it.

3153
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:21,800
Oh, no, no, no, no.

3154
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:22,540
Wait, no, no, no, no.

3155
02:16:22,580 --> 02:16:23,540
Big, big, big baby.

3156
02:16:25,020 --> 02:16:25,960
Mega big baby.

3157
02:16:30,930 --> 02:16:32,450
I know what I'm doing, guys.

3158
02:16:32,530 --> 02:16:33,090
Don't worry.

3159
02:16:33,370 --> 02:16:34,930
All right, this is taking...

3160
02:16:34,930 --> 02:16:36,030
What do you mean?

3161
02:16:36,110 --> 02:16:36,430
This is...

3162
02:16:36,430 --> 02:16:37,110
There it is.

3163
02:16:37,950 --> 02:16:39,490
A mega big baby.

3164
02:16:40,330 --> 02:16:41,670
I don't think we're supposed to...

3165
02:16:41,670 --> 02:16:43,070
You can't touch the light here.

3166
02:16:43,290 --> 02:16:44,790
Yeah, there's nothing to do with the light here.

3167
02:16:45,270 --> 02:16:47,990
We all know Doki's time transcends real time.

3168
02:16:49,630 --> 02:16:50,070
True.

3169
02:16:51,210 --> 02:16:51,650
True.

3170
02:16:51,950 --> 02:16:52,390
I don't know.

3171
02:16:52,830 --> 02:16:53,270
I don't know.

3172
02:16:54,570 --> 02:16:55,310
Oh, oh!

3173
02:16:56,250 --> 02:16:56,810
Okay.

3174
02:16:57,370 --> 02:16:58,590
Big baby time.

3175
02:16:59,030 --> 02:16:59,270
Woo!

3176
02:17:00,010 --> 02:17:01,490
We cannot go bigger?

3177
02:17:02,170 --> 02:17:03,870
Oh, wait, I fucked up.

3178
02:17:03,910 --> 02:17:04,890
Am I smaller now?

3179
02:17:05,370 --> 02:17:05,930
Wait.

3180
02:17:06,930 --> 02:17:08,330
Can I not get bigger?

3181
02:17:08,590 --> 02:17:09,530
Did I fuck up?

3182
02:17:10,690 --> 02:17:13,850
I think I might have fucked up again.

3183
02:17:18,270 --> 02:17:23,210
Wait, if I keep going back and forth, maybe I'll... I just gotta keep going through!

3184
02:17:23,510 --> 02:17:24,530
Now I'm big baby!

3185
02:17:24,870 --> 02:17:25,270
Yeah!

3186
02:17:25,450 --> 02:17:26,390
Oh, I'm too big now.

3187
02:17:26,690 --> 02:17:28,370
I'm too big now.

3188
02:17:29,670 --> 02:17:31,630
I just have to keep going forward.

3189
02:17:34,330 --> 02:17:34,770
Okay.

3190
02:17:45,680 --> 02:17:46,120
Alright.

3191
02:17:46,680 --> 02:17:47,120
Okay.

3192
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:48,160
Come on, get big.

3193
02:17:49,380 --> 02:17:49,820
Alright.

3194
02:17:50,260 --> 02:17:51,620
Okay, come on, get big.

3195
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:54,160
Okay.

3196
02:17:54,380 --> 02:17:54,820
Alright.

3197
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:55,820
Alright, so I think I fucked up.

3198
02:17:55,900 --> 02:17:57,220
I think I fucked up!

3199
02:18:01,970 --> 02:18:02,530
Wait.

3200
02:18:02,530 --> 02:18:05,150
Okay, but I need to fucking make the door big though.

3201
02:18:05,310 --> 02:18:06,730
Door won't go big, guys!

3202
02:18:06,850 --> 02:18:08,030
Door won't go big!

3203
02:18:09,670 --> 02:18:11,150
Door won't go big!

3204
02:18:14,190 --> 02:18:15,190
Oh, no!

3205
02:18:17,630 --> 02:18:19,970
Door, do I... Door swap forever!

3206
02:18:21,030 --> 02:18:23,230
Door swap forever, guys!

3207
02:18:27,870 --> 02:18:28,790
Okay, malicious.

3208
02:18:28,890 --> 02:18:34,610
The problem here is that I can't... The problem here is that I'm too big to go through doors now.

3209
02:18:34,910 --> 02:18:39,150
Because I'm... I'm too big to go through doors right now.

3210
02:18:39,710 --> 02:18:40,890
I fucked up.

3211
02:18:41,950 --> 02:18:43,770
I became too big.

3212
02:18:44,390 --> 02:18:49,910
There's a thing... So size... Size doesn't matter apparently.

3213
02:18:53,330 --> 02:18:53,970
Oh,

3214
02:19:02,150 --> 02:19:03,390
I'm gonna make you big!

3215
02:19:04,190 --> 02:19:07,950
How do I... Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3216
02:19:12,900 --> 02:19:13,320
Okay.

3217
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:15,200
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I'm so smart!

3218
02:19:16,980 --> 02:19:17,400
Oh!

3219
02:19:17,400 --> 02:19:17,820
Oh!

3220
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:20,800
Big... Oh, wait, no, that's not a big door.

3221
02:19:22,700 --> 02:19:23,740
Get out of the way.

3222
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:25,280
Big door!

3223
02:19:25,500 --> 02:19:27,920
Oh, wait, I'm... Wait, I fucked up again.

3224
02:19:31,580 --> 02:19:33,020
Alright, and then tiny door.

3225
02:19:34,140 --> 02:19:34,560
Alright.

3226
02:19:35,520 --> 02:19:36,280
Tiny door.

3227
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:38,740
Oh, wait, that's a big door.

3228
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:39,880
Wait, wait, wait, I'm fucking up.

3229
02:19:40,020 --> 02:19:41,640
I don't know perspectives anymore.

3230
02:19:42,100 --> 02:19:44,420
I don't know perspectives anymore, guys.

3231
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:46,080
Alright, there we go.

3232
02:19:46,900 --> 02:19:47,340
Boop!

3233
02:19:52,420 --> 02:19:53,940
Alright, look at that.

3234
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:55,000
Look at that.

3235
02:19:55,100 --> 02:19:56,180
How did you learn the mechanics?

3236
02:19:56,340 --> 02:19:57,240
I'm so proud.

3237
02:19:59,380 --> 02:20:05,100
Yo, I learned about perspectives after... after two hours and twenty... Alex!

3238
02:20:05,100 --> 02:20:06,360
Alex 41 years.

3239
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:08,800
Alex 41 months!

3240
02:20:09,440 --> 02:20:09,840
Woo!

3241
02:20:10,140 --> 02:20:15,900
Give me some bark nights real quick for Alex, one of the... one of my oldest supporters and subs.

3242
02:20:16,320 --> 02:20:17,720
Thank you, Alex!

3243
02:20:18,360 --> 02:20:22,500
Here, get some fucking bark nights real quick for Alex.

3244
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:23,180
Woo!

3245
02:20:23,780 --> 02:20:24,920
Thank you, thank you!

3246
02:20:25,640 --> 02:20:26,360
Boop!

3247
02:20:32,830 --> 02:20:33,550
Alright.

3248
02:20:33,550 --> 02:20:35,010
Now we're baby.

3249
02:20:38,590 --> 02:20:39,110
Okay.

3250
02:20:39,690 --> 02:20:40,710
Where do I go?

3251
02:20:40,930 --> 02:20:42,110
I'm so fucking pleased.

3252
02:20:42,170 --> 02:20:42,870
I wanna be bigger.

3253
02:20:43,350 --> 02:20:47,110
I'm so so... I wanna... please just make me a big boy now.

3254
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:55,560
Mom, I wanna be a big boy.

3255
02:20:55,860 --> 02:20:57,720
I don't wanna be small anymore.

3256
02:21:00,180 --> 02:21:01,900
Look at the little baby man.

3257
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:06,640
I'm going to bring the... Oh, am I supposed to bring the doors with me?

3258
02:21:09,340 --> 02:21:11,180
No, that can't be right.

3259
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:17,780
No, I... I... No, that can't be right.

3260
02:21:18,040 --> 02:21:19,340
How can I be big?

3261
02:21:19,380 --> 02:21:20,820
Oh, maybe you are right.

3262
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:24,560
Oh.

3263
02:21:24,560 --> 02:21:25,520
I fell.

3264
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:26,400
Oh.

3265
02:21:28,100 --> 02:21:29,260
What is that?

3266
02:21:30,180 --> 02:21:30,820
Wait!

3267
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:32,680
What?

3268
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:35,920
Excuse me?

3269
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:37,280
What?

3270
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:39,080
What was that?

3271
02:21:41,420 --> 02:21:42,060
Oh.

3272
02:21:47,380 --> 02:21:48,060
Oh, hey!

3273
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:51,920
Wait.

3274
02:21:52,100 --> 02:21:53,280
Oh, I made you too small.

3275
02:21:53,460 --> 02:21:53,660
Wait.

3276
02:21:56,680 --> 02:21:57,700
Slowly falling.

3277
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:00,160
Slowly... Wapig!

3278
02:22:00,900 --> 02:22:01,460
Wapig!

3279
02:22:02,180 --> 02:22:04,200
Wapig, are you gonna sing for us today?

3280
02:22:06,660 --> 02:22:07,220
Hey.

3281
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Very slowly heading over there.

3282
02:22:10,660 --> 02:22:11,480
Later, buddy.

3283
02:22:16,170 --> 02:22:17,670
Oh my god, thank god.

3284
02:22:19,310 --> 02:22:20,470
Oh my god, Keith!

3285
02:22:22,230 --> 02:22:24,250
Thank you so much for the raid, Keith!

3286
02:22:25,350 --> 02:22:26,210
Thank you!

3287
02:22:26,550 --> 02:22:27,830
What were you playing?

3288
02:22:28,470 --> 02:22:29,770
Oh, we were playing no game.

3289
02:22:32,010 --> 02:22:33,090
No game.

3290
02:22:33,470 --> 02:22:35,630
Hi everyone from Keith's stream.

3291
02:22:36,070 --> 02:22:38,410
Hi, are you looking forward to tomorrow, Keith?

3292
02:22:38,690 --> 02:22:40,790
For the Dory's charity event?

3293
02:22:41,670 --> 02:22:45,190
I like how it said you weren't playing anything.

3294
02:22:46,650 --> 02:22:48,550
Thank you so much for the follow ads.

3295
02:22:48,550 --> 02:22:49,530
I do appreciate it.

3296
02:22:49,570 --> 02:22:49,770
Thank you.

3297
02:22:49,770 --> 02:22:49,990
Thank you.

3298
02:22:49,990 --> 02:22:50,630
Have a blood heart.

3299
02:22:50,710 --> 02:22:51,810
Thank you so much.

3300
02:22:52,050 --> 02:22:53,470
Big boy raid of 63.

3301
02:22:53,810 --> 02:22:55,350
No game, no life.

3302
02:22:56,670 --> 02:22:57,750
Did you have fun?

3303
02:22:57,930 --> 02:22:59,450
What were you doing in VRChat?

3304
02:23:01,670 --> 02:23:02,170
Alright.

3305
02:23:03,010 --> 02:23:03,630
Let's go.

3306
02:23:04,150 --> 02:23:06,490
Meeting for Cardboard Lovers Association.

3307
02:23:07,470 --> 02:23:07,970
Damn.

3308
02:23:08,830 --> 02:23:09,610
Agenda rule.

3309
02:23:09,750 --> 02:23:10,730
What the fuck?

3310
02:23:10,810 --> 02:23:11,690
It won't even let me raid.

3311
02:23:14,350 --> 02:23:14,850
Is...

3312
02:23:15,610 --> 02:23:16,830
Is it already tomorrow?

3313
02:23:16,830 --> 02:23:19,110
No, tomorrow starts when I go to sleep.

3314
02:23:21,710 --> 02:23:22,730
Green fat.

3315
02:23:25,670 --> 02:23:26,190
Alright.

3316
02:23:26,510 --> 02:23:27,990
Are we in a good stream, Keith?

3317
02:23:30,510 --> 02:23:32,190
I hope you had a good stream.

3318
02:23:33,070 --> 02:23:36,230
Cause all I'm... I'm fucking speedrunning this boy.

3319
02:23:37,250 --> 02:23:39,390
I'm speedrunning the fuck out of this game.

3320
02:23:39,450 --> 02:23:41,110
It's been five minutes since I started the game.

3321
02:23:41,270 --> 02:23:42,190
And look where we are.

3322
02:23:42,730 --> 02:23:43,250
90%.

3323
02:23:43,250 --> 02:23:44,050
Almost done.

3324
02:23:44,250 --> 02:23:44,290
Hey.

3325
02:23:45,330 --> 02:23:45,830
Error.

3326
02:23:45,830 --> 02:23:47,530
Error logged by.

3327
02:23:47,890 --> 02:23:48,810
Orientation protocol.

3328
02:23:48,970 --> 02:23:49,790
Standby for analysis.

3329
02:23:50,030 --> 02:23:50,990
Standby for analysis.

3330
02:23:51,030 --> 02:23:52,030
I broke the game twice.

3331
02:23:54,450 --> 02:23:55,690
Oh, wait.

3332
02:23:55,910 --> 02:23:57,090
Why is there blood again?

3333
02:23:57,470 --> 02:23:58,650
Wait a minute.

3334
02:23:58,970 --> 02:24:02,270
Consistent with an increase in fear, hopelessness, and frustration.

3335
02:24:02,710 --> 02:24:08,330
This is inconceivable as somnascult therapy is coming to correlate with a decrease in these emotions.

3336
02:24:10,490 --> 02:24:11,130
GM beat the world record on her first try.

3337
02:24:11,130 --> 02:24:11,650
More beans?

3338
02:24:11,730 --> 02:24:12,290
You're right.

3339
02:24:12,550 --> 02:24:13,330
You're right.

3340
02:24:13,430 --> 02:24:14,630
It's just more beans.

3341
02:24:14,630 --> 02:24:16,010
It's just more beans.

3342
02:24:16,230 --> 02:24:18,310
Yeah, somebody spilled ketchup, right?

3343
02:24:18,950 --> 02:24:19,510
Impossible.

3344
02:24:20,830 --> 02:24:21,390
Reformulating.

3345
02:24:21,630 --> 02:24:21,810
Oh.

3346
02:24:22,470 --> 02:24:23,030
Oh.

3347
02:24:23,030 --> 02:24:25,570
Oh, I thought that says... I thought that says murder again.

3348
02:24:26,150 --> 02:24:28,990
Patient requires additional somnascult therapy.

3349
02:24:29,270 --> 02:24:30,450
I thought that says murder.

3350
02:24:30,770 --> 02:24:33,010
Emergency exit protocol cannot proceed.

3351
02:24:33,170 --> 02:24:34,070
Wake up.

3352
02:24:34,290 --> 02:24:35,550
Wake up.

3353
02:24:35,570 --> 02:24:36,130
Oh, yeah.

3354
02:24:36,190 --> 02:24:38,950
That doesn't... Yeah, that's not fucky at all.

3355
02:24:39,530 --> 02:24:41,030
That's not fucky at all.

3356
02:24:41,490 --> 02:24:44,610
Continue with somnascult therapy indefinitely on an indefinite basis.

3357
02:24:44,630 --> 02:24:45,610
Oh, I'm not scared.

3358
02:24:45,850 --> 02:24:47,830
As all orientation resources have been exhausted.

3359
02:24:47,830 --> 02:24:50,390
Okay, I'm gonna go to bed because I've been up all day and night.

3360
02:24:50,530 --> 02:24:53,230
So goodnight, may full and chat good luck with beating the speedrun record.

3361
02:24:53,370 --> 02:24:54,410
I know you can do it.

3362
02:24:54,570 --> 02:24:54,790
Woah!

3363
02:24:54,850 --> 02:24:55,070
Woah!

3364
02:25:00,420 --> 02:25:01,540
Like, goodnight, Zio.

3365
02:25:02,140 --> 02:25:02,540
Goodnight.

3366
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:04,500
Oh, it's 3 AM.

3367
02:25:11,880 --> 02:25:13,120
Oh, you gotta just ride home.

3368
02:25:15,140 --> 02:25:16,280
Oh, hey there, guys.

3369
02:25:17,180 --> 02:25:17,580
Hey.

3370
02:25:21,980 --> 02:25:22,680
Oh, hey.

3371
02:25:23,180 --> 02:25:26,340
Oh, I'm stuck now, too.

3372
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:27,540
Oh, hey.

3373
02:25:28,940 --> 02:25:29,980
Hey there, guys.

3374
02:25:34,790 --> 02:25:35,890
Can you catch me?

3375
02:25:35,970 --> 02:25:36,030
Oh!

3376
02:25:36,530 --> 02:25:37,530
Hey there, guys.

3377
02:25:39,310 --> 02:25:39,830
Oh!

3378
02:25:41,770 --> 02:25:42,290
Oh!

3379
02:25:42,290 --> 02:25:42,710
Oh!

3380
02:25:42,730 --> 02:25:43,210
Okay.

3381
02:25:43,850 --> 02:25:44,370
Oh,

3382
02:25:49,220 --> 02:25:49,460
my God.

3383
02:25:50,240 --> 02:25:51,900
What's going... Did I break it?

3384
02:25:52,740 --> 02:25:54,540
What if I break it again?

3385
02:25:54,980 --> 02:25:56,020
What's going on?

3386
02:25:56,020 --> 02:25:57,820
Oh, my God!

3387
02:25:58,180 --> 02:25:59,200
Where am I?

3388
02:26:05,080 --> 02:26:08,180
This is like the most stressful morning try that I wake up.

3389
02:26:08,360 --> 02:26:09,360
Here you guys.

3390
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:09,960
Oh!

3391
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:11,700
Hey.

3392
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:13,520
You got a seizure?

3393
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:17,820
Alright.

3394
02:26:18,060 --> 02:26:18,560
Oh.

3395
02:26:20,780 --> 02:26:21,340
Oh!

3396
02:26:22,280 --> 02:26:22,840
Okay.

3397
02:26:23,180 --> 02:26:24,520
We're gonna wrap it.

3398
02:26:26,720 --> 02:26:27,400
Hey there.

3399
02:26:28,280 --> 02:26:28,840
Alright,

3400
02:26:35,230 --> 02:26:35,850
where do we go?

3401
02:26:37,050 --> 02:26:44,130
This is like one big fierce dream and we have a big hearted bird brain crawl at the wheel.

3402
02:26:48,590 --> 02:26:49,970
Dude, what the fuck do I do?

3403
02:26:51,190 --> 02:26:51,650
Hello?

3404
02:26:51,910 --> 02:26:52,110
Oh!

3405
02:26:52,170 --> 02:26:52,750
Hey there.

3406
02:26:53,670 --> 02:26:56,270
Oh, I have to go out into the sky.

3407
02:26:59,970 --> 02:27:00,650
Oh, wait.

3408
02:27:00,770 --> 02:27:01,110
Wait.

3409
02:27:01,170 --> 02:27:02,770
I forgot this is how you do it.

3410
02:27:02,870 --> 02:27:03,550
Hey there.

3411
02:27:11,320 --> 02:27:11,780
Hello.

3412
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:12,000
Hello.

3413
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:13,900
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

3414
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:18,180
Thank you for completing the Song of Sculpt Standard Orientation Protocol.

3415
02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:19,320
Yes?

3416
02:27:19,640 --> 02:27:26,560
Before we begin the first phase of therapy, I'd like to briefly describe the finite and fragile nature of the dreamscape.

3417
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:32,380
Well, you didn't finish explaining the dreamscape.

3418
02:27:32,740 --> 02:27:33,160
Whoa!

3419
02:27:33,340 --> 02:27:33,720
Whoa!

3420
02:27:33,900 --> 02:27:34,500
Yo,

3421
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:42,380
I don't know how to...

3422
02:27:42,380 --> 02:27:44,560
I can barely walk properly.

3423
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:46,680
In normal games.

3424
02:27:47,100 --> 02:27:48,160
Let alone this.

3425
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,320
This is so fucky.

3426
02:27:51,020 --> 02:27:52,120
How do I get out of here?

3427
02:27:54,960 --> 02:27:55,760
Yeah, this hurts me.

3428
02:27:55,880 --> 02:27:56,500
I dream like that.

3429
02:27:56,540 --> 02:27:57,480
I kept on trying to wake up.

3430
02:27:57,600 --> 02:27:58,540
Then I got dragged.

3431
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:02,360
All of a sudden, after two more times, I finally woke up.

3432
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:03,920
Yeah, this is so fucky.

3433
02:28:03,940 --> 02:28:04,700
This is...

3434
02:28:09,100 --> 02:28:10,060
What do you want me to do?

3435
02:28:11,840 --> 02:28:12,160
Oh.

3436
02:28:19,700 --> 02:28:20,020
Okay.

3437
02:28:20,440 --> 02:28:20,760
Up?

3438
02:28:20,980 --> 02:28:21,400
Oh, I'm going to go up.

3439
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:21,480
Okay.

3440
02:28:21,480 --> 02:28:21,500
I'm going to go up.

3441
02:28:21,500 --> 02:28:21,600
I'm going to go up.

3442
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:21,620
I'm going to go up.

3443
02:28:24,570 --> 02:28:25,490
Hey there, guys.

3444
02:28:26,910 --> 02:28:28,770
Hey, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

3445
02:28:29,190 --> 02:28:30,670
How do I...

3446
02:28:31,890 --> 02:28:33,050
How do I get out of here?

3447
02:28:33,390 --> 02:28:33,830
Stupa!

3448
02:28:34,250 --> 02:28:35,870
Thank you so much for the raid.

3449
02:28:36,670 --> 02:28:37,410
Thank you.

3450
02:28:37,550 --> 02:28:39,790
I hope you had a good stream, Stupa.

3451
02:28:40,190 --> 02:28:41,650
Oh, you're playing Valorant.

3452
02:28:42,470 --> 02:28:43,510
Have you did what?

3453
02:28:43,630 --> 02:28:44,150
I hope you...

3454
02:28:44,150 --> 02:28:44,930
Are you playing Raid?

3455
02:28:45,110 --> 02:28:46,210
Thank you so much for the raid.

3456
02:28:46,210 --> 02:28:46,950
Hi, everyone.

3457
02:28:47,570 --> 02:28:48,010
Hi.

3458
02:28:48,210 --> 02:28:50,550
I am very fucking confused, but...

3459
02:28:50,550 --> 02:28:51,210
Oh, door.

3460
02:28:51,410 --> 02:28:52,050
Baby door?

3461
02:28:52,850 --> 02:28:53,530
Baby door!

3462
02:28:53,610 --> 02:28:53,730
Baby door!

3463
02:28:56,010 --> 02:28:57,370
Oh, my gosh.

3464
02:28:57,990 --> 02:28:58,650
Oh, hey.

3465
02:29:00,310 --> 02:29:00,790
Okay.

3466
02:29:01,210 --> 02:29:02,910
Baby door saved my life.

3467
02:29:04,410 --> 02:29:05,390
Now, where do I go?

3468
02:29:07,410 --> 02:29:08,130
Oh, no.

3469
02:29:08,190 --> 02:29:09,050
Me stream froze.

3470
02:29:09,170 --> 02:29:09,650
I refresh.

3471
02:29:09,950 --> 02:29:10,770
Here we go.

3472
02:29:11,010 --> 02:29:11,790
Look at that.

3473
02:29:11,830 --> 02:29:12,570
I'm so smart.

3474
02:29:13,150 --> 02:29:14,810
I had a good 100-year stream.

3475
02:29:14,830 --> 02:29:17,710
I don't know how to stop you streaming the raid anymore.

3476
02:29:17,970 --> 02:29:20,250
Yeah, I stream at like degenerate times.

3477
02:29:20,810 --> 02:29:22,830
Very, very degenerate times, Stupa.

3478
02:29:23,250 --> 02:29:23,730
I'm going to go up.

3479
02:29:23,750 --> 02:29:24,590
Very degenerate.

3480
02:29:24,690 --> 02:29:25,010
All right.

3481
02:29:25,170 --> 02:29:29,170
Of course, nothing is more challenging than the difficulty of changing perspective.

3482
02:29:29,170 --> 02:29:32,290
I had to stream at like after midnight because that's when my brain turns on.

3483
02:29:32,750 --> 02:29:38,250
But then I only had like four hours of sleep, so I don't know if it's technically on or not.

3484
02:29:42,670 --> 02:29:43,950
No spooks here.

3485
02:29:44,350 --> 02:29:45,650
Nothing to worry about.

3486
02:29:45,750 --> 02:29:45,790
Oh, really?

3487
02:29:45,790 --> 02:29:47,550
Oh, really, Crimbo?

3488
02:29:47,910 --> 02:29:48,430
Really?

3489
02:29:48,550 --> 02:29:49,970
Thank you for the $5.

3490
02:29:50,450 --> 02:29:53,210
I don't know why I don't believe you.

3491
02:29:53,270 --> 02:29:53,510
I'm sorry.

3492
02:29:53,590 --> 02:29:54,250
I'm sorry.

3493
02:29:54,250 --> 02:29:56,530
Hey, hey, listen.

3494
02:30:02,090 --> 02:30:02,870
Oh, hey.

3495
02:30:03,530 --> 02:30:04,250
I'm listening.

3496
02:30:05,610 --> 02:30:06,790
How do I do this?

3497
02:30:07,690 --> 02:30:08,250
Bow.

3498
02:30:09,650 --> 02:30:10,210
Bow?

3499
02:30:11,750 --> 02:30:12,310
Bow.

3500
02:30:12,330 --> 02:30:12,490
Oh!

3501
02:30:15,090 --> 02:30:15,930
Where am I?

3502
02:30:16,830 --> 02:30:17,390
Stairs.

3503
02:30:22,660 --> 02:30:23,220
Oh!

3504
02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:23,780
Oh!

3505
02:30:25,060 --> 02:30:26,580
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

3506
02:30:26,580 --> 02:30:27,020
Let me in!

3507
02:30:27,020 --> 02:30:27,740
Let me in!

3508
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:27,920
Oh!

3509
02:30:40,490 --> 02:30:42,190
I don't wanna go upstairs.

3510
02:30:42,190 --> 02:30:42,270
Hey.

3511
02:30:48,930 --> 02:30:49,790
Oh god!

3512
02:30:50,410 --> 02:30:51,310
Oh god!

3513
02:30:55,260 --> 02:30:57,460
Wait, what was that sound?

3514
02:30:57,780 --> 02:30:59,720
Wait, wait what?

3515
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:00,720
What do you mean?

3516
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:08,980
No key, it's not touching things, you've become too small, you got stuck on the wall, now you broke the elevator, are you proud?

3517
02:31:09,200 --> 02:31:10,040
What do you mean?

3518
02:31:12,480 --> 02:31:15,560
Oh, somebody has to... oh hey, I did it.

3519
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:19,040
Yeah!

3520
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:19,960
I did it!

3521
02:31:22,980 --> 02:31:23,500
Wow!

3522
02:31:23,500 --> 02:31:24,820
How am I fucking up?

3523
02:31:24,940 --> 02:31:25,620
I don't understand!

3524
02:31:27,940 --> 02:31:28,460
Wow!

3525
02:31:31,460 --> 02:31:33,760
Okay, I don't understand how I'm fucking this up.

3526
02:31:37,440 --> 02:31:38,720
This is it.

3527
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:39,640
What?

3528
02:31:41,020 --> 02:31:41,660
Oh!

3529
02:31:42,060 --> 02:31:42,700
Okay.

3530
02:31:43,720 --> 02:31:44,360
Boop.

3531
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:47,680
Oh.

3532
02:31:48,620 --> 02:31:49,540
Here, oh!

3533
02:31:49,740 --> 02:31:50,380
What?

3534
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:51,260
Okay.

3535
02:31:51,540 --> 02:31:52,180
Alright.

3536
02:31:52,760 --> 02:31:54,320
Go the opposite way, what?

3537
02:31:54,900 --> 02:31:55,540
Alright.

3538
02:31:55,900 --> 02:31:57,020
Go to go...

3539
02:31:58,180 --> 02:31:58,820
Here?

3540
02:32:02,380 --> 02:32:03,020
Oh!

3541
02:32:03,220 --> 02:32:04,880
Okay, this will work eventually.

3542
02:32:06,260 --> 02:32:08,000
Perception is not reality.

3543
02:32:08,400 --> 02:32:09,040
Okay.

3544
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:10,540
Okay, that makes total sense.

3545
02:32:10,540 --> 02:32:12,900
I... that makes total sense.

3546
02:32:14,160 --> 02:32:15,040
Okay, wait.

3547
02:32:16,840 --> 02:32:18,660
It's gonna... it'll let me through!

3548
02:32:18,980 --> 02:32:21,420
If I just keep going, it's gonna let me through!

3549
02:32:25,300 --> 02:32:29,440
Maybe if I stop... okay, I just need to not look... not look at the signs.

3550
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:35,040
If I don't look at the signs... if I don't look at the signs... maybe... maybe that's it.

3551
02:32:35,180 --> 02:32:36,180
Okay, that's not it.

3552
02:32:36,300 --> 02:32:38,120
Just keep moving, I just gotta keep moving.

3553
02:32:39,740 --> 02:32:40,900
I just gotta keep moving.

3554
02:32:43,100 --> 02:32:44,300
I just gotta keep moving.

3555
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:47,760
I...

3556
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:49,500
Oh my god, wait please.

3557
02:32:51,320 --> 02:32:52,480
I don't get it!

3558
02:32:54,100 --> 02:32:55,540
What do you want me to do?

3559
02:33:01,380 --> 02:33:02,460
No, I'm not looking!

3560
02:33:02,540 --> 02:33:03,220
Okay, okay, okay.

3561
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:04,800
If I do this... alright, maybe I do this.

3562
02:33:05,980 --> 02:33:08,080
Okay, clearly that thing ain't it.

3563
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:12,140
Okay, what do you want me... I don't understand.

3564
02:33:12,660 --> 02:33:14,200
I'm not looking at the signs!

3565
02:33:14,620 --> 02:33:15,760
I'm looking at the floor!

3566
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:17,400
What if I just go backwards?

3567
02:33:17,820 --> 02:33:18,240
Oh!

3568
02:33:18,340 --> 02:33:19,020
How about this?

3569
02:33:19,020 --> 02:33:19,900
I'll just go backwards!

3570
02:33:20,340 --> 02:33:21,380
Oh, what are they gonna do?

3571
02:33:21,720 --> 02:33:22,140
Oh!

3572
02:33:23,240 --> 02:33:28,000
I went backwards and it worked!

3573
02:33:28,440 --> 02:33:29,900
Oh, I guess that was the thing!

3574
02:33:30,120 --> 02:33:31,040
Just go backwards!

3575
02:33:32,200 --> 02:33:33,060
Wait, is it?

3576
02:33:33,260 --> 02:33:34,260
Wait a minute.

3577
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:36,260
Wait a minute.

3578
02:33:36,600 --> 02:33:37,600
Is it actually?

3579
02:33:37,860 --> 02:33:39,280
Do I just go backwards?

3580
02:33:43,390 --> 02:33:44,510
Wait a minute.

3581
02:33:44,850 --> 02:33:45,370
What?

3582
02:33:46,590 --> 02:33:47,570
I swear!

3583
02:33:49,110 --> 02:33:50,810
No, okay, it wasn't the backwards.

3584
02:33:50,910 --> 02:33:52,210
It wasn't backwards, chat.

3585
02:33:52,450 --> 02:33:53,970
It was not backwards.

3586
02:33:55,150 --> 02:33:57,250
I don't know the pattern here.

3587
02:33:57,750 --> 02:33:59,010
I don't know the pattern.

3588
02:34:02,070 --> 02:34:02,590
Okay.

3589
02:34:03,110 --> 02:34:05,090
Okay, but this has been more successful.

3590
02:34:05,710 --> 02:34:07,110
This has been more successful!

3591
02:34:07,190 --> 02:34:09,810
Going backwards has been more successful!

3592
02:34:15,830 --> 02:34:16,030
What?

3593
02:34:16,310 --> 02:34:17,070
Okay, wait.

3594
02:34:17,470 --> 02:34:18,710
Okay, wait a minute.

3595
02:34:20,350 --> 02:34:21,230
Okay, wait.

3596
02:34:21,310 --> 02:34:22,110
I got no idea.

3597
02:34:22,190 --> 02:34:23,950
Do you think I have an idea?

3598
02:34:24,270 --> 02:34:24,790
Look!

3599
02:34:24,850 --> 02:34:26,850
It's been dinging when I go backwards!

3600
02:34:29,810 --> 02:34:30,330
Okay.

3601
02:34:35,250 --> 02:34:35,770
Okay.

3602
02:34:36,710 --> 02:34:37,230
Alright.

3603
02:34:39,890 --> 02:34:40,410
Exit.

3604
02:34:41,270 --> 02:34:43,030
Perception is not reality.

3605
02:34:44,090 --> 02:34:44,970
Okay, cool.

3606
02:34:46,110 --> 02:34:46,890
Okay, cool.

3607
02:34:46,990 --> 02:34:47,830
What the fuck?

3608
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:51,600
Okay.

3609
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:52,240
Okay.

3610
02:34:52,880 --> 02:34:53,360
What?

3611
02:34:53,480 --> 02:34:54,260
How am I wrong?

3612
02:34:54,520 --> 02:34:55,660
How am I wrong?

3613
02:34:57,660 --> 02:34:59,100
How am I wrong, lol?

3614
02:35:00,200 --> 02:35:00,680
Okay.

3615
02:35:01,940 --> 02:35:02,420
Okay.

3616
02:35:02,620 --> 02:35:03,340
Well then.

3617
02:35:08,360 --> 02:35:09,560
Apparently I've been doing better.

3618
02:35:09,740 --> 02:35:11,300
I've been doing better walking backwards.

3619
02:35:11,780 --> 02:35:13,660
I've been doing better walking backwards.

3620
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:14,400
Hahaha.

3621
02:35:19,300 --> 02:35:20,720
Yo, what the fuck?

3622
02:35:20,860 --> 02:35:21,760
How am I doing better?

3623
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:21,980
Backwards.

3624
02:35:22,060 --> 02:35:23,120
Better working backwards.

3625
02:35:23,220 --> 02:35:24,200
I don't even know the pattern!

3626
02:35:24,900 --> 02:35:26,920
I don't know the pattern of this.

3627
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:31,700
I don't even know the pattern!

3628
02:35:45,800 --> 02:35:47,460
I don't know the pattern, guys.

3629
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:49,120
But it went ding, ding, ding.

3630
02:35:50,340 --> 02:35:51,460
Oh my god.

3631
02:35:51,800 --> 02:35:52,820
Dude, fuck you.

3632
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:53,820
I got...

3633
02:35:53,820 --> 02:35:54,660
Hall 5!

3634
02:35:55,040 --> 02:35:57,080
I've made it to hall number 5.

3635
02:35:57,140 --> 02:35:58,960
And I still don't know the pattern.

3636
02:36:00,020 --> 02:36:00,540
Hahaha.

3637
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:07,360
I mean it's all fine!

3638
02:36:13,070 --> 02:36:15,030
I will never know how to do this.

3639
02:36:15,390 --> 02:36:18,730
As long as I just don't- apparently I just need to not look at the signs.

3640
02:36:23,330 --> 02:36:24,250
Oh shit!

3641
02:36:24,530 --> 02:36:25,730
Where do I go now?

3642
02:36:26,210 --> 02:36:26,670
Whoa!

3643
02:36:28,270 --> 02:36:28,910
Oh!

3644
02:36:29,230 --> 02:36:29,870
Deep!

3645
02:36:30,110 --> 02:36:31,430
Oh wow okay okay.

3646
02:36:31,730 --> 02:36:33,870
Okay this is actual insanity right here.

3647
02:36:34,090 --> 02:36:37,030
This is- this is like more game.

3648
02:36:37,350 --> 02:36:39,770
This is actual insanity right now guys.

3649
02:36:42,630 --> 02:36:44,050
We're actually going crazy.

3650
02:36:44,310 --> 02:36:46,150
We're actually going crazy.

3651
02:36:49,170 --> 02:36:50,250
Oh my god please.

3652
02:36:51,570 --> 02:36:51,890
Okay.

3653
02:36:53,070 --> 02:36:53,990
Okay okay left.

3654
02:36:54,610 --> 02:36:55,250
Left!

3655
02:36:56,670 --> 02:36:58,490
I realized how totally...

3656
02:37:01,330 --> 02:37:04,350
Yo I fucking- yo dude I hate this.

3657
02:37:05,970 --> 02:37:06,490
How

3658
02:37:16,980 --> 02:37:18,220
am I getting it wrong?

3659
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:19,720
Okay.

3660
02:37:19,740 --> 02:37:25,220
Now all it says every third time you don't get it right on the third time will be the opposite of the- of the other- What?

3661
02:37:25,980 --> 02:37:26,500
What?

3662
02:37:30,280 --> 02:37:30,540
What?

3663
02:37:31,480 --> 02:37:35,420
Okay maybe if I do this and I go boom and then boom and then...

3664
02:37:36,460 --> 02:37:36,980
Okay.

3665
02:37:37,160 --> 02:37:38,040
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

3666
02:37:38,550 --> 02:37:38,880
Boom.

3667
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:39,380
Boom.

3668
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:40,140
Alright.

3669
02:37:41,340 --> 02:37:42,780
Alright alright I got this.

3670
02:37:43,060 --> 02:37:43,480
Boom.

3671
02:37:43,580 --> 02:37:43,920
Boom.

3672
02:37:44,220 --> 02:37:44,680
Alright.

3673
02:37:46,210 --> 02:37:46,540
What?

3674
02:37:46,740 --> 02:37:47,220
How?

3675
02:37:47,340 --> 02:37:47,720
How?

3676
02:37:47,940 --> 02:37:48,360
I

3677
02:37:51,640 --> 02:37:52,780
- I give up.

3678
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:53,860
Oh.

3679
02:37:54,470 --> 02:37:55,340
I give up.

3680
02:37:59,260 --> 02:38:00,770
I don't understand the pattern.

3681
02:38:01,610 --> 02:38:02,890
What's the pattern?

3682
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:07,170
What is the pattern?

3683
02:38:08,800 --> 02:38:10,310
Why am I wrong now?

3684
02:38:14,840 --> 02:38:15,500
Okay.

3685
02:38:16,660 --> 02:38:17,840
How are you wrong?

3686
02:38:19,060 --> 02:38:19,520
Okay.

3687
02:38:19,620 --> 02:38:19,980
Okay.

3688
02:38:22,320 --> 02:38:22,780
Okay.

3689
02:38:28,070 --> 02:38:28,530
Alright.

3690
02:38:28,530 --> 02:38:28,910
Okay.

3691
02:38:30,210 --> 02:38:30,670
Alright.

3692
02:38:32,210 --> 02:38:32,670
What

3693
02:38:40,950 --> 02:38:42,930
is - wait you get there you'll need to look at the exit.

3694
02:38:43,010 --> 02:38:49,210
Look at which way the sign is pointing and face the opposite way while walking out the exit.

3695
02:38:49,530 --> 02:38:49,990
What?

3696
02:38:53,570 --> 02:38:54,670
Oh so I do this?

3697
02:38:55,310 --> 02:38:56,930
Is that what you want me to do?

3698
02:38:57,150 --> 02:38:57,610
Is that what you want me to do?

3699
02:38:58,530 --> 02:39:07,290
Oh no now I'm just- Right right then left don't look the right right the last time or- Right right then right.

3700
02:39:09,070 --> 02:39:10,430
Right right then right.

3701
02:39:10,430 --> 02:39:11,070
Right right left.

3702
02:39:11,950 --> 02:39:12,350
Left.

3703
02:39:15,930 --> 02:39:18,010
Oh you're all confusing me.

3704
02:39:18,370 --> 02:39:20,270
Oh you're

3705
02:39:25,960 --> 02:39:25,960
all confusing me.

3706
02:39:26,100 --> 02:39:27,560
Okay now which way?

3707
02:39:27,640 --> 02:39:28,700
Which way do I go chat?

3708
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:29,780
Which way?

3709
02:39:30,060 --> 02:39:32,360
Alright lead me guys lead me.

3710
02:39:34,200 --> 02:39:35,660
Am I up here?

3711
02:39:36,580 --> 02:39:39,900
Okay basically look the opposite of the exit sign.

3712
02:39:40,100 --> 02:39:43,180
Okay and then go the opposite way.

3713
02:39:43,260 --> 02:39:44,260
Alright I'm doing it.

3714
02:39:44,400 --> 02:39:46,340
Oh oh alright.

3715
02:39:46,600 --> 02:39:48,160
And then opposite.

3716
02:39:48,780 --> 02:39:50,440
Oh oh I'm doing it.

3717
02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:55,220
Oh and then look the opposite.

3718
02:39:55,880 --> 02:39:56,840
And then.

3719
02:39:57,760 --> 02:39:59,420
Oh we did it.

3720
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:01,260
Oh we did it.

3721
02:40:01,420 --> 02:40:02,340
Yeah I'm back to the exit.

3722
02:40:02,360 --> 02:40:02,820
Backseat gaming.

3723
02:40:03,200 --> 02:40:05,380
Backseat gaming has solved the game.

3724
02:40:05,540 --> 02:40:06,520
Backseat gaming.

3725
02:40:09,220 --> 02:40:11,520
Backseat gaming has won yet again.

3726
02:40:11,940 --> 02:40:13,020
Oh my god.

3727
02:40:14,800 --> 02:40:15,480
Whew.

3728
02:40:17,160 --> 02:40:19,120
Yeah I don't know why backwards work.

3729
02:40:19,320 --> 02:40:23,740
Apparently walking backwards was way way helpful for some fucking reason.

3730
02:40:25,300 --> 02:40:29,940
For some reason walking backwards made me more progress.

3731
02:40:37,030 --> 02:40:41,550
Oh my god apparently I broke the game yet again by walking backwards apparently.

3732
02:40:45,210 --> 02:40:46,710
Oh shit wait what the fuck.

3733
02:40:49,690 --> 02:40:51,030
Wait did I fuck up?

3734
02:40:51,530 --> 02:40:52,310
Wait a minute.

3735
02:40:56,310 --> 02:40:57,110
It was half.

3736
02:40:57,270 --> 02:40:58,690
So you have to make the wrong path.

3737
02:40:59,590 --> 02:41:01,410
The first thing you look at is the dead end.

3738
02:41:01,470 --> 02:41:02,610
You see it look at the black.

3739
02:41:02,930 --> 02:41:04,450
What the fuck did I do?

3740
02:41:04,450 --> 02:41:04,710
What did I do?

3741
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:10,160
Beat him man.

3742
02:41:10,500 --> 02:41:13,740
Oh god.

3743
02:41:14,380 --> 02:41:16,300
I just broke the game.

3744
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:18,200
Hahaha.

3745
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:20,200
Hahaha.

3746
02:41:26,420 --> 02:41:26,760
Oh.

3747
02:41:29,820 --> 02:41:30,500
Oh.

3748
02:41:30,740 --> 02:41:31,300
Yo.

3749
02:41:31,740 --> 02:41:32,420
Hey.

3750
02:41:33,600 --> 02:41:34,700
Where am I?

3751
02:41:34,700 --> 02:41:36,060
Where am I?

3752
02:41:41,280 --> 02:41:41,960
Alright.

3753
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:44,200
Whoa.

3754
02:41:44,280 --> 02:41:44,960
Whoa.

3755
02:41:46,020 --> 02:41:46,700
Whoa.

3756
02:41:46,980 --> 02:41:48,340
I don't like it.

3757
02:41:50,290 --> 02:41:51,910
Oh I don't.

3758
02:41:51,950 --> 02:41:52,330
Whoa.

3759
02:41:53,190 --> 02:41:54,330
Where's the light?

3760
02:41:54,670 --> 02:41:56,010
Where is the light?

3761
02:41:56,170 --> 02:41:56,690
Hahaha.

3762
02:42:10,060 --> 02:42:12,000
You are crazy now.

3763
02:42:12,420 --> 02:42:14,100
I don't know what I'm doing.

3764
02:42:16,600 --> 02:42:17,280
Whoa.

3765
02:42:18,980 --> 02:42:19,460
I can't do anything.

3766
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:21,600
What do I do if I can't.

3767
02:42:21,720 --> 02:42:22,060
Hahaha.

3768
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:26,600
I can't do anything if I can't grab anything.

3769
02:42:30,320 --> 02:42:30,960
Oh.

3770
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:31,660
Oh.

3771
02:42:31,980 --> 02:42:32,620
Whoa.

3772
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:36,520
I'm crash batting it.

3773
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:38,240
Arrow.

3774
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:40,640
Arrow.

3775
02:42:42,120 --> 02:42:42,760

02:42:51,750 --> 02:42:52,390
Arrow.

3779
02:43:03,710 --> 02:43:04,930

3780
02:43:06,070 --> 02:43:08,050
I think I fucked up guys.

3781
02:43:08,370 --> 02:43:08,750
Hahaha.

No I didn't.

3784
02:43:11,190 --> 02:43:12,110
I'm so smart.

3785
02:43:13,110 --> 02:43:13,890
Oh.

3786
02:43:19,170 --> 02:43:20,710

3787
02:43:21,190 --> 02:43:21,970
Hahaha.

3788
02:43:23,210 --> 02:43:25,570

Hahaha.

3798
02:43:56,390 --> 02:43:58,270
How do I get out of here?

3799
02:43:58,990 --> 02:43:59,670
Hahaha.

3800
02:43:59,730 --> 02:44:00,410

Oh hey.

3803
02:44:07,400 --> 02:44:08,500
What the fuck?

3804
02:44:08,540 --> 02:44:09,420
When did this showed up?

3805
02:44:09,840 --> 02:44:11,200
Why was this here?

3806
02:44:19,700 --> 02:44:20,380
Hello?

3807
02:44:21,420 --> 02:44:22,100
Hello?

3808
02:44:22,280 --> 02:44:22,780
Oh hey.

3809
02:44:24,420 --> 02:44:24,440
Oh.

02:44:24,560 --> 02:44:25,240
Okay.

3811
02:44:25,640 --> 02:44:26,320
Hahaha.

3812
02:44:28,260 --> 02:44:29,360
Oh shit.

3813
02:44:29,460 --> 02:44:30,740
Watch time is broke.

3814
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:31,460
Hahaha.

3815
02:44:36,830 --> 02:44:39,370
Stream elements is getting fucked up.

3816
02:44:40,250 --> 02:44:40,930
Hey.

Alright.

3819
02:44:43,910 --> 02:44:44,870
This is highly unusual.

3820
02:44:45,370 --> 02:44:48,390
It appears you have entered the Sun Ascult's diagnostic framework.

3821
02:44:49,330 --> 02:44:51,790
Patients do not have access to this stream.

3822
02:44:51,850 --> 02:44:52,010
Oh.

3823
02:44:55,370 --> 02:44:56,150
Wait.

3824
02:44:56,330 --> 02:44:57,170
How do I make big?

3825
02:44:58,050 --> 02:44:58,830
Big?

3826
02:44:58,970 --> 02:45:00,010
Diagnostic warning.

3827
02:45:00,230 --> 02:45:01,430
Unrealistic user.

3828
02:45:01,530 --> 02:45:04,870
Dream objects may result in dream integrity fail state.

3829
02:45:05,270 --> 02:45:06,050
Big?

3830
02:45:06,610 --> 02:45:07,390
Big.

3831
02:45:08,710 --> 02:45:09,490

02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:18,220
Big.

3834
02:45:19,880 --> 02:45:20,660
Big.

3835
02:45:21,100 --> 02:45:21,880

3840
02:45:29,540 --> 02:45:30,300
Big.

3841
02:45:31,320 --> 02:45:32,080
Big.

3842
02:45:33,560 --> 02:45:34,320
Big.

3843
02:45:35,220 --> 02:45:35,340
Big.

3844
02:45:35,720 --> 02:45:36,100
Big.

3845
02:45:37,680 --> 02:45:38,720
There we go.

3846
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:39,720
Hahaha.

3847
02:45:42,760 --> 02:45:43,880
There we go.

3848
02:45:44,060 --> 02:45:44,700
Wait.

3849
02:45:44,860 --> 02:45:46,160
Wait a minute.

3850
02:45:46,860 --> 02:45:49,140
Oh it wasn't supposed to be big.

3851
02:45:50,100 --> 02:45:50,860
What?

3852
02:45:51,100 --> 02:45:51,800
Hahaha.

3853
02:45:51,800 --> 02:45:53,600
It wasn't supposed to be big.

3854
02:45:53,860 --> 02:45:55,620
Wait a minute.

3855
02:45:57,260 --> 02:45:58,720
If I put it here.

3856
02:46:02,020 --> 02:46:02,660
Maybe.

3857
02:46:03,460 --> 02:46:04,760
Wait a minute.

3858
02:46:05,260 --> 02:46:05,900
Okay.

3859
02:46:06,700 --> 02:46:07,660
Here we go.

3860
02:46:07,960 --> 02:46:09,740
And then I go through here.

3861
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:11,800
And then.

3862
02:46:12,480 --> 02:46:13,460
Hey guys.

3863
02:46:13,880 --> 02:46:14,820
Hey everyone.

3864
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:15,520
Hey there.

My friend.

3866
02:46:18,860 --> 02:46:19,940
We get inside.

3868
02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:23,840
Oh.

3869
02:46:26,880 --> 02:46:27,900
Hey everyone.

3870
02:46:28,300 --> 02:46:29,240

02:46:35,420 --> 02:46:36,100
Hahaha.

3875
02:46:37,580 --> 02:46:37,980
Hahaha.

3876
02:46:43,310 --> 02:46:44,850

3877
02:46:45,330 --> 02:46:47,350
I don't know about that guys.

3878
02:46:49,410 --> 02:46:51,850
I think the last time we went too small.

3879
02:46:51,990 --> 02:46:52,970
We fucked up.

3880
02:46:53,410 --> 02:46:53,730
Hahaha.

3881
02:46:54,350 --> 02:46:55,030
Hahaha.

Okay here we go.

Okay wait here we go.

There we go.

3892
02:47:12,740 --> 02:47:13,220
We did it.

3893
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:14,960
And now we're small.

3894
02:47:15,260 --> 02:47:15,860
Wait we're big.

3895
02:47:16,400 --> 02:47:17,300
Now we're big.

3896
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:19,620
I'm so fucking confused guys.

3897
02:47:23,420 --> 02:47:23,920

And then.

3901
02:47:29,800 --> 02:47:30,480

What other things?

3909
02:47:39,960 --> 02:47:40,900
What are things?

3910
02:47:41,560 --> 02:47:44,800
Paradox prevention protocols may not be fully implemented.

3911
02:47:45,400 --> 02:47:45,440
What do you mean?

3912
02:47:46,080 --> 02:47:46,140
Hahaha.

3913
02:47:48,640 --> 02:47:49,680

Alright here we go.

3917
02:47:54,620 --> 02:47:55,860
And now I'm big.

3918
02:47:57,480 --> 02:47:58,240
Boop boop.

3919
02:47:59,600 --> 02:48:00,120
Alright.

3920
02:48:00,520 --> 02:48:01,800
There has to be something.

3921
02:48:02,480 --> 02:48:03,000
Carry.

3922
02:48:03,480 --> 02:48:04,000
Oh!

3923
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:04,360
Oh!

3924
02:48:05,140 --> 02:48:06,660
I'm carrying myself.

3925
02:48:06,940 --> 02:48:07,260
Wooo!

3926
02:48:14,850 --> 02:48:17,130
Oh I don't like that.

3927
02:48:17,390 --> 02:48:18,170
That's weird.

3928
02:48:19,130 --> 02:48:21,530
They have a fun art to test size.

3929
02:48:22,210 --> 02:48:22,390
Hahaha.

3930
02:48:23,310 --> 02:48:24,130
Oh.

3931
02:48:24,650 --> 02:48:25,470
Oh.

3932
02:48:28,050 --> 02:48:28,870
Oh.

3933
02:48:30,970 --> 02:48:31,950
Oh I'm sorry.

3934
02:48:32,090 --> 02:48:33,190
Oh I'm sorry.

3935
02:48:33,940 --> 02:48:35,190
Wow I'm sorry.

3936
02:48:35,770 --> 02:48:36,450
Hahaha.

3937
02:48:38,250 --> 02:48:39,450
I don't think they like that.

3938
02:48:39,570 --> 02:48:41,270
Oh I don't feel so good.

3939
02:48:41,550 --> 02:48:42,050
Hahaha.

3940
02:48:47,970 --> 02:48:49,570
You don't think they like that?

3941
02:48:49,830 --> 02:48:50,130
Hahaha.

3942
02:48:51,790 --> 02:48:53,030
Oh shit.

3943
02:48:54,130 --> 02:48:55,190
I'm disappearing.

3944
02:48:56,430 --> 02:48:57,510
I'm disappearing.

3945
02:49:03,430 --> 02:49:05,870
Please paradox for creating refrains.

3946
02:49:06,330 --> 02:49:06,970
Hello.

3947
02:49:16,220 --> 02:49:16,860
Hey.

3948
02:49:18,100 --> 02:49:18,920
Hey there.

3949
02:49:20,340 --> 02:49:20,980
Woah!

3950
02:49:26,920 --> 02:49:29,200
Oh I don't feel so good.

3951
02:49:29,740 --> 02:49:29,900
Hahaha.

3952
02:49:30,880 --> 02:49:31,560
Oh.

3953
02:49:34,630 --> 02:49:36,730
This is apparently heaven and hell.

3954
02:49:36,950 --> 02:49:37,630
Alright.

3955
02:49:37,810 --> 02:49:38,350
Hello.

3956
02:49:38,470 --> 02:49:40,130
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

3957
02:49:40,290 --> 02:49:44,290
Who else watched the stream?

3958
02:49:44,790 --> 02:49:45,470
Hahaha.

3959
02:49:45,470 --> 02:49:50,490
I found myself in a place where I understood that each of us begins as nothing.

3960
02:49:51,070 --> 02:49:55,030
Where everything you perceive is shaped by seeing it exactly the same.

3961
02:49:55,050 --> 02:49:56,290
Exactly the way I wanted to.

3962
02:49:57,290 --> 02:49:58,170
White space.

3963
02:50:03,440 --> 02:50:04,000
Alright.

3964
02:50:04,200 --> 02:50:04,980
White space.

3965
02:50:05,300 --> 02:50:08,100
I didn't really process all twelve.

3966
02:50:08,220 --> 02:50:08,940
Holy shit twelve.

3967
02:50:09,160 --> 02:50:11,300
I think I watched like three hours of it.

3968
02:50:11,340 --> 02:50:14,100
I watched like every hour of it.

3969
02:50:14,220 --> 02:50:17,940
Like every um three or four hours of Anus.

3970
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:18,500
Anus.

3971
02:50:19,080 --> 02:50:19,640
Anus.

3972
02:50:19,740 --> 02:50:20,160
Anus.

3973
02:50:20,920 --> 02:50:21,480
Sorry.

3974
02:50:21,480 --> 02:50:22,260
On this penis.

3975
02:50:23,240 --> 02:50:24,520
Sorry I'm getting a fucking.

3976
02:50:24,740 --> 02:50:26,780
I'm having a mini stroke right now.

3977
02:50:27,200 --> 02:50:27,540
Hahaha.

3978
02:50:28,020 --> 02:50:28,540
Hahaha.

3979
02:50:30,920 --> 02:50:33,520
But yeah I also watched like bits of it.

3980
02:50:33,620 --> 02:50:35,340
And then I watched the guy get a tattoo.

3981
02:50:35,840 --> 02:50:37,240
And like his.

3982
02:50:37,340 --> 02:50:39,120
Their like memorable clips and stuff like that.

3983
02:50:40,280 --> 02:50:41,080
And then.

3984
02:50:41,340 --> 02:50:41,740
Um.

3985
02:50:42,020 --> 02:50:43,040
And watched how them.

3986
02:50:43,080 --> 02:50:43,280
Oh!

3987
02:50:43,880 --> 02:50:44,400
Delete.

3988
02:50:44,580 --> 02:50:45,680
Watch them delete the.

3989
02:50:45,760 --> 02:50:46,140
The.

3990
02:50:46,400 --> 02:50:47,740
The YouTube channel.

3991
02:50:53,890 --> 02:50:54,410
Alright.

3992
02:50:54,570 --> 02:50:54,890
Alright.

3993
02:50:56,090 --> 02:50:57,130
Where do I go?

3994
02:51:00,730 --> 02:51:01,210
Jump?

3995
02:51:01,390 --> 02:51:02,630
Am I gonna be tall again?

3996
02:51:02,790 --> 02:51:03,910
Oh no it's just an exit.

3997
02:51:05,210 --> 02:51:05,690
Wait.

3998
02:51:05,690 --> 02:51:06,490
What the fuck?

3999
02:51:08,490 --> 02:51:09,830
I'm going through the exit.

4000
02:51:19,870 --> 02:51:21,310
Where is this gonna take me?

4001
02:51:21,930 --> 02:51:23,510
Where are you gonna take me sir?

4002
02:51:26,690 --> 02:51:27,170
Oh.

4003
02:51:28,870 --> 02:51:30,110
Oh my lost.

4004
02:51:33,330 --> 02:51:35,290
Imagine this game was about a man having a delusion.

4005
02:51:35,330 --> 02:51:37,330
And just went to five different places.

4006
02:51:37,370 --> 02:51:39,150
While babbling random nonsense.

4007
02:51:39,190 --> 02:51:40,130
And passes out.

4008
02:51:41,290 --> 02:51:41,730
Oh.

4009
02:51:42,590 --> 02:51:43,030
Oh.

4010
02:51:43,470 --> 02:51:44,510
Wait that's not fair.

4011
02:51:45,430 --> 02:51:46,290
I'm not tall.

4012
02:51:47,270 --> 02:51:48,130
That's not fair.

4013
02:51:49,150 --> 02:51:49,590
Oh.

4014
02:51:50,390 --> 02:51:51,350
Oh what the fuck?

4015
02:51:52,090 --> 02:51:52,870
What did I do?

4016
02:51:52,990 --> 02:51:53,410
Wow!

4017
02:51:54,330 --> 02:51:55,230
What is this?

4018
02:51:57,610 --> 02:51:58,530
What did I do?

4019
02:52:02,980 --> 02:52:03,420
Oh.

4020
02:52:03,560 --> 02:52:04,140
Is this another.

4021
02:52:04,320 --> 02:52:04,760
Whoa.

4022
02:52:06,700 --> 02:52:07,780
What is this?

4023
02:52:13,120 --> 02:52:14,120
Oh I can't even.

4024
02:52:14,840 --> 02:52:15,320
Oh.

4025
02:52:17,480 --> 02:52:18,520
Wait where did it go?

4026
02:52:18,760 --> 02:52:19,500
Did I break it?

4027
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:20,980
Where did you go?

4028
02:52:21,580 --> 02:52:22,420
Oh hey there.

4029
02:52:22,980 --> 02:52:24,120
I didn't break it.

4030
02:52:24,360 --> 02:52:24,840
Okay.

4031
02:52:25,380 --> 02:52:25,860
Okay.

4032
02:52:26,780 --> 02:52:28,360
Alright this is a stepping stone.

4033
02:52:31,960 --> 02:52:34,240
Every time I'm just like did I break this?

4034
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:37,980
Oh shit.

4035
02:52:39,140 --> 02:52:40,300
I keep thinking I broke this.

4036
02:52:40,320 --> 02:52:41,580
I'm breaking the game.

4037
02:52:43,360 --> 02:52:45,200
Wait how do I make you big?

4038
02:52:45,540 --> 02:52:46,480
How do I make you?

4039
02:52:46,580 --> 02:52:47,020
Okay wait.

4040
02:52:47,680 --> 02:52:48,180
Wait.

4041
02:52:49,760 --> 02:52:50,940
Are you big?

4042
02:52:51,380 --> 02:52:52,200
You're not big.

4043
02:52:52,880 --> 02:52:53,920
I'll make you big.

4044
02:53:01,670 --> 02:53:02,570
Oh no.

4045
02:53:02,650 --> 02:53:03,550
Why are you small now?

4046
02:53:04,510 --> 02:53:06,150
I don't remember how I make you big.

4047
02:53:06,690 --> 02:53:07,190
Oh.

4048
02:53:07,210 --> 02:53:08,310
Why are you so small?

4049
02:53:11,630 --> 02:53:13,130
No you're too small.

4050
02:53:15,390 --> 02:53:16,410
Oh there we go.

4051
02:53:16,470 --> 02:53:17,030
There we go.

4052
02:53:17,430 --> 02:53:19,450
Wait why are you not getting big?

4053
02:53:19,610 --> 02:53:20,430
I don't understand.

4054
02:53:21,010 --> 02:53:22,350
How am I fucking up?

4055
02:53:25,050 --> 02:53:27,090
How are you not getting big?

4056
02:53:31,030 --> 02:53:31,550
Okay.

4057
02:53:31,550 --> 02:53:32,070
Alright.

4058
02:53:32,370 --> 02:53:33,170
Hey key back.

4059
02:53:34,270 --> 02:53:34,790
Okay.

4060
02:53:39,510 --> 02:53:40,030
Alright.

4061
02:53:44,050 --> 02:53:45,250
But it keeps getting bigger.

4062
02:53:45,270 --> 02:53:45,610
It keeps getting small.

4063
02:53:50,210 --> 02:53:51,510
Wait wait wait wait wait.

4064
02:53:53,350 --> 02:53:53,870
Okay.

4065
02:53:54,930 --> 02:53:56,110
Are you big now?

4066
02:53:57,890 --> 02:53:58,830
Are you big?

4067
02:53:59,150 --> 02:54:00,050
Oh you're big.

4068
02:54:02,550 --> 02:54:03,510
Okay there we go.

4069
02:54:03,610 --> 02:54:04,090
I did it.

4070
02:54:04,510 --> 02:54:05,550
I'm tall now.

4071
02:54:07,730 --> 02:54:10,530
This is the list of all the things I could imagine.

4072
02:54:11,510 --> 02:54:14,950
Because with the lifetime of life itself behind me.

4073
02:54:15,090 --> 02:54:17,230
And all of the weight that it carried.

4074
02:54:17,430 --> 02:54:17,570
I was like.

4075
02:54:17,570 --> 02:54:21,070
I realized that seeing things the way I wanted to.

4076
02:54:21,190 --> 02:54:23,530
Was not as easy as it used to be.

4077
02:54:27,810 --> 02:54:28,370
Alright.

4078
02:54:28,810 --> 02:54:30,250
We're going here now.

4079
02:54:30,970 --> 02:54:32,410
We're going here now.

4080
02:54:41,590 --> 02:54:43,230
Oh that's a big light switch.

4081
02:54:43,570 --> 02:54:43,810
Woah.

4082
02:54:47,970 --> 02:54:49,050
Okay I don't want to.

4083
02:54:52,990 --> 02:54:53,550
Okay.

4084
02:54:53,950 --> 02:54:54,510
Okay.

4085
02:54:55,210 --> 02:54:55,770
Okay.

4086
02:54:55,990 --> 02:54:56,550
Okay.

4087
02:54:56,550 --> 02:54:56,790
Hahaha.

4088
02:54:58,450 --> 02:54:59,070
Hahaha.

4089
02:55:02,300 --> 02:55:03,830
I'll guess what you just heard.

4090
02:55:03,870 --> 02:55:04,790
Okay okay.

4091
02:55:05,090 --> 02:55:05,670
Haha.

4092
02:55:08,990 --> 02:55:09,610
Woah.

4093
02:55:10,550 --> 02:55:11,230
That's it.

4094
02:55:15,410 --> 02:55:16,030
Okay.

4095
02:55:16,750 --> 02:55:18,490
Okay lost her mic.

4096
02:55:19,830 --> 02:55:20,830
I feel like.

4097
02:55:20,850 --> 02:55:22,170
I don't know about you guys.

4098
02:55:22,310 --> 02:55:23,950
How much longer this stream for.

4099
02:55:24,110 --> 02:55:26,150
I have no idea crowd slay.

4100
02:55:27,650 --> 02:55:31,190
Until I finish this game apparently.

4101
02:55:33,690 --> 02:55:35,250
Where do I go up?

4102
02:55:37,910 --> 02:55:40,770
Do I need to position itself again?

4103
02:55:42,710 --> 02:55:44,310
Welcome back, sneaking!

4104
02:55:46,910 --> 02:55:47,930
Pointing afterwards?

4105
02:55:48,250 --> 02:55:49,530
I'm not sure yet.

4106
02:55:49,890 --> 02:55:51,010
I'm not sure.

4107
02:55:51,650 --> 02:55:53,070
I'm not sure yet.

4108
02:55:53,070 --> 02:55:55,390
I'm just... Oh, I'll give you a kiss.

4109
02:55:57,770 --> 02:55:58,650
That's for Autumn.

4110
02:56:02,870 --> 02:56:04,350
Oh, what do I do?

4111
02:56:05,310 --> 02:56:06,230
Alright, one more.

4112
02:56:06,290 --> 02:56:07,930
I guess this is the hour.

4113
02:56:08,410 --> 02:56:09,450
This is the hour.

4114
02:56:10,470 --> 02:56:11,490
This is... Oh God!

4115
02:56:11,570 --> 02:56:12,710
How do I get out of here?

4116
02:56:18,370 --> 02:56:20,250
How do I get out of here?

4117
02:56:20,490 --> 02:56:21,090
Oh no!

4118
02:56:23,450 --> 02:56:23,890
Please!

4119
02:56:37,070 --> 02:56:38,350
I'm looking up.

4120
02:56:39,070 --> 02:56:40,270
I'm going up!

4121
02:56:40,530 --> 02:56:41,510
Doo doo doo!

4122
02:56:42,530 --> 02:56:42,850
Oh!

4123
02:56:43,170 --> 02:56:44,310
What the fuck?

4124
02:56:44,570 --> 02:56:44,770
Did

4125
02:56:48,540 --> 02:56:48,760
I?

4126
02:56:49,120 --> 02:56:51,180
Yo, these instructions are not...

4127
02:56:51,180 --> 02:56:53,640
These instructions are not helpful at all.

4128
02:56:54,020 --> 02:56:54,500
These instructions are not helpful at all.

4129
02:56:57,390 --> 02:56:59,070
I guess I go down now.

4130
02:57:06,090 --> 02:57:06,730
Hey!

4131
02:57:07,550 --> 02:57:08,630
Wasn't I just here?

4132
02:57:09,730 --> 02:57:10,370
Hello?

4133
02:57:12,050 --> 02:57:13,250
Wasn't I just here?

4134
02:57:15,730 --> 02:57:16,730
Hey guys!

4135
02:57:17,310 --> 02:57:18,410
I'm back again!

4136
02:57:21,970 --> 02:57:24,250
Maybe if I keep doing it...

4137
02:57:24,830 --> 02:57:26,830
If I keep doing it...

4138
02:57:28,270 --> 02:57:31,570
And maybe if I keep doing it...

4139
02:57:31,570 --> 02:57:34,670
Maybe if I just keep going through...

4140
02:57:34,670 --> 02:57:36,650
I'll find the answer.

4141
02:57:38,270 --> 02:57:38,910
That's...

4142
02:57:38,910 --> 02:57:40,170
That's how this... Oh no!

4143
02:57:40,250 --> 02:57:41,350
I just go through the white...

4144
02:57:41,350 --> 02:57:43,690
I just go through this...

4145
02:57:43,690 --> 02:57:46,550
I just go through this...

4146
02:57:47,170 --> 02:57:48,150
That's all I have to do.

4147
02:57:48,290 --> 02:57:48,750
Alright.

4148
02:57:56,290 --> 02:57:57,250
Oh shit.

4149
02:57:59,170 --> 02:58:01,030
This watcher makes me feel giddy.

4150
02:58:01,030 --> 02:58:01,950
Makes me laugh.

4151
02:58:02,130 --> 02:58:03,110
Aww, that's really sweet!

4152
02:58:04,090 --> 02:58:05,230
That's really sweet.

4153
02:58:05,430 --> 02:58:07,110
I'm glad you're having a good time.

4154
02:58:10,610 --> 02:58:13,310
Um, no.

4155
02:58:15,870 --> 02:58:18,750
You see, I needed a game for Variety Friday.

4156
02:58:19,090 --> 02:58:19,290
You see, I needed a game for Variety Friday.

4157
02:58:19,290 --> 02:58:20,670
And so here we are.

4158
02:58:21,410 --> 02:58:21,490
And so here we are.

4159
02:58:26,040 --> 02:58:26,540
Oh.

4160
02:58:28,880 --> 02:58:29,580
Hey there.

4161
02:58:30,560 --> 02:58:31,060
Oh.

4162
02:58:35,260 --> 02:58:36,920
I'm using this to...

4163
02:58:36,920 --> 02:58:38,040
Oh wait, no never mind.

4164
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:41,700
Yo, I thought I figured it out.

4165
02:58:41,860 --> 02:58:42,080
Yo, I thought I figured it out.

4166
02:58:42,080 --> 02:58:44,060
And I fell down so I don't like...

4167
02:58:46,140 --> 02:58:46,640
Oh!

4168
02:58:46,800 --> 02:58:48,180
Oh wait, I just have to...

4169
02:58:48,180 --> 02:58:49,240
Okay wait.

4170
02:58:49,700 --> 02:58:50,300
Wait, I got it.

4171
02:58:50,360 --> 02:58:50,940
I got it.

4172
02:58:53,160 --> 02:58:54,580
I got it.

4173
02:58:54,660 --> 02:58:55,740
I got it now.

4174
02:58:56,300 --> 02:58:57,700
Then I do this.

4175
02:58:58,140 --> 02:58:59,660
And I go BAM!

4176
02:58:59,700 --> 02:59:00,860
And then I do this.

4177
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:03,000
And then I go BAM!

4178
02:59:03,160 --> 02:59:04,480
Dude, I'm so smart.

4179
02:59:05,320 --> 02:59:06,120
Look at this.

4180
02:59:11,530 --> 02:59:13,390
I've never tried Stanley Parable.

4181
02:59:14,590 --> 02:59:15,110
Never.

4182
02:59:15,810 --> 02:59:17,050
Never tried it before.

4183
02:59:20,110 --> 02:59:22,430
Casually dismissing the beauty of the game.

4184
02:59:22,530 --> 02:59:23,270
What beauty!

4185
02:59:23,370 --> 02:59:24,890
It was just...

4186
02:59:24,890 --> 02:59:25,910
It was just a chess board.

4187
02:59:26,390 --> 02:59:27,850
It was just a chess board.

4188
02:59:28,210 --> 02:59:30,570
What's so beautiful about a chess board?

4189
02:59:30,750 --> 02:59:31,130
What?

4190
02:59:31,330 --> 02:59:32,350
What do you mean?

4191
02:59:35,430 --> 02:59:36,290
Hey, geez.

4192
03:00:01,740 --> 03:00:03,080
Did I make you bigger?

4193
03:00:06,340 --> 03:00:07,120
Wait, wait, wait.

4194
03:00:07,140 --> 03:00:08,380
I'm making you bigger, mister.

4195
03:00:08,980 --> 03:00:10,520
I'm making you a big boy.

4196
03:00:11,260 --> 03:00:12,720
Yeah, big boy now.

4197
03:00:13,460 --> 03:00:14,780
Did I make you bigger here?

4198
03:00:16,960 --> 03:00:18,200
Oh, I made you small.

4199
03:00:18,380 --> 03:00:19,260
Wait, okay.

4200
03:00:19,360 --> 03:00:20,060
Big boy time.

4201
03:00:22,440 --> 03:00:23,660
It's big boy time.

4202
03:00:25,720 --> 03:00:26,880
It's big boy time.

4203
03:00:27,260 --> 03:00:28,120
Oh, shit.

4204
03:00:28,160 --> 03:00:29,040
This is a big boy.

4205
03:00:29,980 --> 03:00:30,460
Alright.

4206
03:00:31,340 --> 03:00:32,240
I got this.

4207
03:00:32,340 --> 03:00:33,140
I know what to do.

4208
03:00:33,240 --> 03:00:34,420
My brain has expanded.

4209
03:00:35,040 --> 03:00:37,440
My brain has expanded through this.

4210
03:00:39,920 --> 03:00:40,740
Look at that.

4211
03:00:41,020 --> 03:00:42,160
Big cheese now.

4212
03:00:42,380 --> 03:00:43,200
And then...

4213
03:00:43,960 --> 03:00:45,260
And then I do this.

4214
03:00:46,820 --> 03:00:47,520
I do, I do, I do.

4215
03:00:49,660 --> 03:00:50,820
In the wrong...

4216
03:00:50,820 --> 03:00:51,180
Wait!

4217
03:00:51,640 --> 03:00:52,080
Wait,

4218
03:00:57,270 --> 03:00:58,410
this is not how you play this?

4219
03:00:59,190 --> 03:00:59,690
This is not...

4220
03:01:01,790 --> 03:01:02,730
That fucked up.

4221
03:01:05,470 --> 03:01:05,910
Alright.

4222
03:01:07,450 --> 03:01:08,950
My brain has shrunk.

4223
03:01:09,030 --> 03:01:10,030
I'm so confused.

4224
03:01:10,170 --> 03:01:11,230
I'm so confused, too.

4225
03:01:12,790 --> 03:01:13,230
No!

4226
03:01:13,230 --> 03:01:13,670
No!

4227
03:01:13,750 --> 03:01:14,190
Geez!

4228
03:01:17,750 --> 03:01:19,510
Am I supposed to bring it here?

4229
03:01:20,170 --> 03:01:21,630
No, I can't.

4230
03:01:21,630 --> 03:01:22,450
Yeah, it's locked.

4231
03:01:22,630 --> 03:01:24,030
Oh my god, my cheese!

4232
03:01:24,490 --> 03:01:26,230
I need to do this all over again!

4233
03:01:29,270 --> 03:01:30,310
My cheese!

4234
03:01:34,230 --> 03:01:35,270
My cheese!

4235
03:01:39,940 --> 03:01:40,680
Okay, wait.

4236
03:01:41,480 --> 03:01:42,000
Okay.

4237
03:01:45,220 --> 03:01:48,140
The cheese betrayed just like it betrayed my stomach.

4238
03:01:49,700 --> 03:01:51,000
Tom no make big boy.

4239
03:01:51,860 --> 03:01:52,940
Big boy time!

4240
03:01:54,360 --> 03:01:55,900
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.

4241
03:01:55,940 --> 03:01:56,800
I know this mechanic.

4242
03:01:59,860 --> 03:02:00,340
Okay.

4243
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:01,480
Okay.

4244
03:02:01,640 --> 03:02:02,620
Okay, I need to make it bigger.

4245
03:02:03,420 --> 03:02:04,500
I need to make...

4246
03:02:04,500 --> 03:02:05,240
Oh, I fucked up!

4247
03:02:05,500 --> 03:02:07,040
Why do I keep fucking up?

4248
03:02:07,140 --> 03:02:09,240
Why do I keep fucking up, chat?

4249
03:02:13,040 --> 03:02:13,520
Okay.

4250
03:02:13,700 --> 03:02:14,180
Alright.

4251
03:02:14,340 --> 03:02:14,660
Cheese.

4252
03:02:15,720 --> 03:02:16,200
Cheese!

4253
03:02:18,180 --> 03:02:18,660
Please!

4254
03:02:18,660 --> 03:02:20,400
Oh my god.

4255
03:02:22,760 --> 03:02:23,240
Please!

4256
03:02:24,200 --> 03:02:25,340
Please just be big!

4257
03:02:25,700 --> 03:02:26,900
That's all I want you to be!

4258
03:02:27,040 --> 03:02:27,320
Cheese!

4259
03:02:31,310 --> 03:02:32,170
Oh my god!

4260
03:02:32,210 --> 03:02:33,030
How did it get smaller?

4261
03:02:33,470 --> 03:02:34,990
How did you get smaller cheese?

4262
03:02:35,330 --> 03:02:36,270
I don't understand!

4263
03:02:36,930 --> 03:02:37,970
How did you get smaller?

4264
03:02:40,030 --> 03:02:41,130
Please let me up.

4265
03:02:41,630 --> 03:02:42,410
Cheese please.

4266
03:02:43,290 --> 03:02:44,130
Cheese please.

4267
03:02:45,010 --> 03:02:48,610
Please, I need you to stop getting smaller.

4268
03:02:49,070 --> 03:02:49,470
Cheese!

4269
03:02:51,090 --> 03:02:51,610
No!

4270
03:02:51,990 --> 03:02:52,690
I can't!

4271
03:02:52,690 --> 03:02:55,670
No, my own!

4272
03:02:57,110 --> 03:02:58,530
My own fucked up!

4273
03:03:01,850 --> 03:03:02,370
Okay.

4274
03:03:03,030 --> 03:03:03,550
Alright.

4275
03:03:03,710 --> 03:03:04,250
Big O.

4276
03:03:08,120 --> 03:03:09,560
Big O, you gotta get big.

4277
03:03:10,540 --> 03:03:11,260
That's right.

4278
03:03:11,420 --> 03:03:12,920
Big O, you gotta get big.

4279
03:03:13,400 --> 03:03:15,180
Oh, Big O is a bit too big.

4280
03:03:21,090 --> 03:03:22,410
How do I make you bigger?

4281
03:03:24,130 --> 03:03:24,650
Yes.

4282
03:03:24,690 --> 03:03:26,430
Alright cheese, now it's your turn.

4283
03:03:27,190 --> 03:03:28,570
Now it's your turn cheese.

4284
03:03:30,750 --> 03:03:31,750
Cheese please.

4285
03:03:32,130 --> 03:03:32,730
Cheese.

4286
03:03:33,190 --> 03:03:35,950
Please cheese, I need you to be big too.

4287
03:03:37,610 --> 03:03:38,210
Please.

4288
03:03:38,570 --> 03:03:40,650
I fucked up so many times.

4289
03:03:40,790 --> 03:03:42,890
Just give me the...

4290
03:03:42,890 --> 03:03:44,110
Oh my god!

4291
03:03:44,210 --> 03:03:46,190
Why am I stuck at this level?

4292
03:03:48,950 --> 03:03:50,950
Why am I stuck here?

4293
03:03:54,590 --> 03:03:57,330
Because I know this part.

4294
03:03:57,770 --> 03:03:59,010
Oh my god!

4295
03:03:59,010 --> 03:04:00,390
It doesn't even make me...

4296
03:04:00,390 --> 03:04:01,470
Now you're big.

4297
03:04:01,830 --> 03:04:02,790
I'll just keep...

4298
03:04:02,790 --> 03:04:07,490
If it keeps hitting me in the head, I'll get big.

4299
03:04:09,070 --> 03:04:09,550
Okay.

4300
03:04:10,530 --> 03:04:12,010
Alright, there we go cheese.

4301
03:04:12,550 --> 03:04:14,290
I should have just put it on top of my head.

4302
03:04:14,690 --> 03:04:15,590
That's all I needed.

4303
03:04:16,470 --> 03:04:17,730
Alright cheese here.

4304
03:04:19,550 --> 03:04:20,030
Okay.

4305
03:04:21,750 --> 03:04:22,230
Okay.

4306
03:04:29,820 --> 03:04:30,300
Wait.

4307
03:04:30,300 --> 03:04:30,540
Wait.

4308
03:04:30,700 --> 03:04:32,360
Oh, was I supposed to go up here?

4309
03:04:32,740 --> 03:04:35,880
I did all of that and I wasn't supposed to go up here?

4310
03:04:37,060 --> 03:04:38,500
Are you kidding me?

4311
03:04:42,090 --> 03:04:43,710
I worked so hard.

4312
03:04:44,030 --> 03:04:47,590
Making a big block and big cheese.

4313
03:04:48,610 --> 03:04:49,950
And there's a...

4314
03:04:54,130 --> 03:04:57,090
And I can't even get out there.

4315
03:04:59,290 --> 03:05:00,610
What is the point of life?

4316
03:05:00,850 --> 03:05:02,790
What is the point of life?

4317
03:05:03,530 --> 03:05:04,670
This is stupid.

4318
03:05:04,930 --> 03:05:05,850
I'm out of here.

4319
03:05:05,850 --> 03:05:07,550
Oh, I can't even get out of here.

4320
03:05:10,030 --> 03:05:11,750
What does this want me to do?

4321
03:05:16,540 --> 03:05:17,860
What do you want from me?

4322
03:05:18,300 --> 03:05:19,780
What do you want from me?

4323
03:05:29,050 --> 03:05:30,910
What do you want from me cheese?

4324
03:05:37,270 --> 03:05:38,530
I'm just gonna sit here.

4325
03:05:39,390 --> 03:05:42,130
Trying to fucking figure out what this wants from me.

4326
03:05:42,790 --> 03:05:44,230
I'm so confused.

4327
03:05:44,850 --> 03:05:45,330
Hahaha.

4328
03:05:45,330 --> 03:05:45,570
Hahaha.

4329
03:05:49,550 --> 03:05:52,610
What do you mean remembering the chess puzzle from earlier?

4330
03:05:52,990 --> 03:05:54,050
What do you mean?

4331
03:05:54,410 --> 03:05:54,830
Oh.

4332
03:05:56,970 --> 03:05:57,610
My

4333
03:06:18,470 --> 03:06:20,250
god, I'm going fucking crazy here.

4334
03:06:20,710 --> 03:06:21,190
Hahaha.

4335
03:06:23,170 --> 03:06:24,850
Stupid fucking cheese.

4336
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:32,200
Oh my god.

4337
03:06:32,260 --> 03:06:34,160
This is actually making me crazy apparently.

4338
03:06:34,680 --> 03:06:35,180
Hahaha.

4339
03:06:36,260 --> 03:06:36,420
Hahaha.

4340
03:06:37,880 --> 03:06:38,520
No!

4341
03:06:39,120 --> 03:06:39,760
Okay.

4342
03:06:40,160 --> 03:06:40,800
Wait.

4343
03:06:42,180 --> 03:06:42,980
I'm gonna figure this out again.

4344
03:06:47,940 --> 03:06:49,060
Oh, you wanna make you big?

4345
03:06:49,160 --> 03:06:49,540
I forgot.

4346
03:06:49,920 --> 03:06:51,280
I forgot how to make big.

4347
03:06:52,060 --> 03:06:52,540
Hahaha.

4348
03:06:54,680 --> 03:06:56,280
Quebec thank you so much for the follow.

4349
03:06:56,400 --> 03:06:57,140
Thank you, thank you.

4350
03:06:57,180 --> 03:06:58,420
I really do appreciate it.

4351
03:06:58,520 --> 03:06:59,680
Thank you so much.

4352
03:07:01,040 --> 03:07:01,520
Big.

4353
03:07:02,140 --> 03:07:03,020
Okay, okay.

4354
03:07:03,160 --> 03:07:06,400
Very slowly and surely, we make you big.

4355
03:07:13,710 --> 03:07:14,890
Oh, have a...

4356
03:07:14,890 --> 03:07:16,510
Have a butt heart.

4357
03:07:16,950 --> 03:07:17,430
Quebec.

4358
03:07:28,900 --> 03:07:29,340
Big.

4359
03:07:29,920 --> 03:07:30,360
Big.

4360
03:07:40,480 --> 03:07:40,920
Big.

4361
03:07:40,920 --> 03:07:41,320
Please just...

4362
03:07:41,700 --> 03:07:42,680
Please just let me go through.

4363
03:07:42,760 --> 03:07:43,120
Please.

4364
03:07:43,500 --> 03:07:43,940
Please.

4365
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:50,100
Writing, but I still don't know how to make things big.

4366
03:07:50,140 --> 03:07:51,980
Promise I'm on Doki's stream.

4367
03:07:52,320 --> 03:07:52,660
Hahaha.

4368
03:07:53,120 --> 03:07:55,720
I still don't know how to make big things apparently.

4369
03:07:57,360 --> 03:07:57,800
Hahaha.

4370
03:08:17,290 --> 03:08:18,170
Oh god.

4371
03:08:18,230 --> 03:08:19,230
This is so trippy.

4372
03:08:20,130 --> 03:08:20,510
Oh my god.

4373
03:08:20,690 --> 03:08:21,010
I don't...

4374
03:08:21,010 --> 03:08:21,650
Oh my god.

4375
03:08:21,670 --> 03:08:23,430
This is actually so fucking trippy, guys.

4376
03:08:23,970 --> 03:08:24,970
What the fuck?

4377
03:08:33,650 --> 03:08:34,330
Where are you?

4378
03:08:35,370 --> 03:08:39,230
Where am I?

4379
03:08:39,610 --> 03:08:40,050
Hahaha.

4380
03:08:40,350 --> 03:08:40,790
Oh.

4381
03:08:41,310 --> 03:08:41,750
Oh.

4382
03:08:46,820 --> 03:08:48,740
Oh, now I'm in the alarm clock.

4383
03:08:50,480 --> 03:08:52,400
That is like actually a nightmare, right?

4384
03:08:52,440 --> 03:08:53,040
Oh my gosh.

4385
03:08:53,060 --> 03:08:53,500
What the fuck?

4386
03:08:53,600 --> 03:08:53,920
Hahaha.

4387
03:08:54,800 --> 03:08:56,020
7.59.

4388
03:08:56,840 --> 03:08:57,280
AM.

4389
03:09:00,810 --> 03:09:02,510
Oh, I don't like the flashy lights.

4390
03:09:04,430 --> 03:09:05,010
Oh.

4391
03:09:10,840 --> 03:09:11,560
Oh.

4392
03:09:12,400 --> 03:09:13,120
Hahaha.

4393
03:09:13,760 --> 03:09:16,760
Yo, it's 3... it's 3.33 AM.

4394
03:09:17,420 --> 03:09:18,140
Hahaha.

4395
03:09:29,130 --> 03:09:30,430
It is 8 AM.

4396
03:09:30,590 --> 03:09:31,310
Okay.

4397
03:09:31,570 --> 03:09:32,030
Goodnight.

4398
03:09:32,370 --> 03:09:32,870
Hahaha.

4399
03:09:34,550 --> 03:09:35,270
Oh.

4400
03:09:40,810 --> 03:09:42,490
What's with these sounds?

4401
03:09:45,810 --> 03:09:46,170
Hello.

4402
03:09:46,450 --> 03:09:48,470
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

4403
03:09:48,770 --> 03:09:54,710
And by now, you may have realized that all of this has happened exactly the way it was supposed to.

4404
03:09:54,730 --> 03:09:54,810
Oh.

4405
03:09:55,110 --> 03:09:55,790
Hey there.

4406
03:09:56,070 --> 03:10:03,610
You see, everyone who comes to the institute does so because they feel that they are no longer in control of something important to them.

4407
03:10:08,230 --> 03:10:09,010
Oh my god.

4408
03:10:09,050 --> 03:10:10,910
I actually haven't hydrated for three hours.

4409
03:10:10,990 --> 03:10:12,070
What the fuck?

4410
03:10:12,370 --> 03:10:12,730
Hahaha.

4411
03:10:13,310 --> 03:10:16,070
But, more often than not, the problem is that...

4412
03:10:16,070 --> 03:10:17,390
Yeah, I'm gonna need some water right now.

4413
03:10:17,430 --> 03:10:17,790
Oh my gosh.

4414
03:10:17,790 --> 03:10:18,430
My arm's weak now.

4415
03:10:18,550 --> 03:10:19,650
I'm gonna need some water right now.

4416
03:10:20,310 --> 03:10:21,370
Thanks for the reminder.

4417
03:10:21,550 --> 03:10:24,990
The problem is that we become so afraid of failure that we refuse to see our problem.

4418
03:10:27,210 --> 03:10:32,170
And so, we do the same things again and again and again.

4419
03:10:32,810 --> 03:10:37,310
And therein, of course, we find exactly the failure we were looking for.

4420
03:10:45,880 --> 03:10:47,520
Oh, I really retraced it.

4421
03:10:47,560 --> 03:10:48,100
Oh, hey.

4422
03:10:49,480 --> 03:10:50,220
Oh, look.

4423
03:10:50,280 --> 03:10:51,260
There's my bouncy castle.

4424
03:10:52,040 --> 03:10:53,140
There it is.

4425
03:10:53,600 --> 03:10:54,700
I made that.

4426
03:10:56,240 --> 03:10:56,760
Oh.

4427
03:11:04,230 --> 03:11:06,150
You see things again and again.

4428
03:11:06,170 --> 03:11:08,150
Sounds so like... I wonder who could that be.

4429
03:11:10,030 --> 03:11:10,110
Hahaha.

4430
03:11:13,590 --> 03:11:15,930
Your life will always be a struggle.

4431
03:11:16,170 --> 03:11:18,310
And you will always have to... Like, I burped that.

4432
03:11:18,670 --> 03:11:19,130
Hahaha.

4433
03:11:19,130 --> 03:11:22,630
But today, you had the chance to see things differently.

4434
03:11:23,490 --> 03:11:29,590
Even though it meant facing obstacles that seemed impossible at first, you thought outside the box.

4435
03:11:29,730 --> 03:11:31,230
And you overcame them.

4436
03:11:31,830 --> 03:11:34,190
Because you saw things from every angle.

4437
03:11:34,330 --> 03:11:37,870
You saw things... You understood them for what they really are.

4438
03:11:38,010 --> 03:11:39,210
I don't think so, dude.

4439
03:11:39,430 --> 03:11:39,910
Hahaha.

4440
03:11:39,910 --> 03:11:40,050
Hahaha.

4441
03:11:42,470 --> 03:11:45,710
Dude, I burped my entire way through.

4442
03:11:46,310 --> 03:11:46,830
Hahaha.

4443
03:11:47,190 --> 03:11:47,710
Hahaha.

4444
03:11:49,730 --> 03:11:52,550
I still don't know how to properly play this game.

4445
03:11:52,870 --> 03:11:53,290
Hahaha.

4446
03:12:03,950 --> 03:12:05,130
What is this?

4447
03:12:05,150 --> 03:12:08,250
Brandon, this is super little, but we're almost done with it, though.

4448
03:12:09,050 --> 03:12:10,230
You meant burp first, then?

4449
03:12:10,250 --> 03:12:11,150
Yes, absolutely.

4450
03:12:11,830 --> 03:12:12,310
Hahaha.

4451
03:12:14,250 --> 03:12:14,770
Hey.

4452
03:12:14,770 --> 03:12:16,970
Oh, I can't press the soda machine anymore.

4453
03:12:17,710 --> 03:12:19,030
You'll be back in the real world.

4454
03:12:19,450 --> 03:12:22,930
Some part of you will say that none of this was real.

4455
03:12:23,290 --> 03:12:25,890
So, how could it have really meant anything?

4456
03:12:27,090 --> 03:12:34,470
But, just like the power of perspective itself, it would have been as real as you believed it to be.

4457
03:12:35,590 --> 03:12:38,310
All you've got to do is wait.

4458
03:12:41,460 --> 03:12:42,360
Here I am.

4459
03:12:46,750 --> 03:12:48,170
Oh, we did it!

4460
03:12:48,910 --> 03:12:49,890
I did it.

4461
03:12:50,430 --> 03:12:50,950
Hahaha.

4462
03:12:52,270 --> 03:12:52,350
Hahaha.

4463
03:12:53,970 --> 03:12:54,810
Hahaha.

4464
03:12:56,290 --> 03:12:57,750
I did it.

4465
03:12:58,070 --> 03:12:58,790
Hahaha.

4466
03:13:00,450 --> 03:13:01,290
Hahaha.

4467
03:13:02,170 --> 03:13:03,010
Woo!

4468
03:13:03,910 --> 03:13:05,670
World record pace!

4469
03:13:06,730 --> 03:13:08,170
Seven minutes!

4470
03:13:08,450 --> 03:13:08,950
Damn.

4471
03:13:10,030 --> 03:13:11,370
Holy shit.

4472
03:13:12,010 --> 03:13:13,710
Did we beat the world record?

4473
03:13:13,810 --> 03:13:14,350
I think so.

4474
03:13:14,690 --> 03:13:16,810
It's like seven minutes, right?

4475
03:13:17,090 --> 03:13:17,750
Hahaha.

4476
03:13:18,170 --> 03:13:18,650
Hahaha.

4477
03:13:22,290 --> 03:13:22,810
Gratulant.

4478
03:13:23,010 --> 03:13:23,690
Thank you, everyone.

4479
03:13:23,930 --> 03:13:25,530
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4480
03:13:25,530 --> 03:13:27,790
I gotta submit it to the ADGD cuties.

4481
03:13:28,210 --> 03:13:29,550
I gotta submit it.

4482
03:13:29,650 --> 03:13:31,550
Now tell me, how do you make things bigger?

4483
03:13:31,910 --> 03:13:32,430
Hahaha.

4484
03:13:33,350 --> 03:13:33,870
Hahaha.

4485
03:13:36,610 --> 03:13:37,890
I still don't know.

4486
03:13:38,110 --> 03:13:38,630
Hahaha.

4487
03:13:40,270 --> 03:13:42,310
I still don't know how to play this game.

4488
03:13:42,530 --> 03:13:47,990
I honestly, I keep fucking up making things bigger and smaller for some reason.

4489
03:13:48,530 --> 03:13:49,050
Hahaha.

4490
03:13:50,570 --> 03:13:52,090
First try, no success.

4491
03:13:54,590 --> 03:13:56,290
Thank you so much for the follow, Brandon.

4492
03:13:56,390 --> 03:13:57,150
Thank you, thank you.

4493
03:13:57,230 --> 03:13:58,390
I really do appreciate it.

4494
03:13:58,570 --> 03:14:00,070
Have a, have a play heart.

4495
03:14:00,210 --> 03:14:00,690
Thank you.

4496
03:14:02,070 --> 03:14:03,030
Holy shit.

4497
03:14:03,330 --> 03:14:04,850
I am so tired.

4498
03:14:04,990 --> 03:14:11,530
My brain was not supposed to think about, like, I think I broke the game like three or four times, chat.

4499
03:14:11,930 --> 03:14:18,870
Like, I don't even think, I think I, the apple, the apple stage, I think I brute forced the apple stage.

4500
03:14:19,310 --> 03:14:19,650
Hahaha.

4501
03:14:21,930 --> 03:14:27,350
I think, I think I solved the apple puzzle only by sheer luck.

4502
03:14:27,650 --> 03:14:28,250
Hahaha.

4503
03:14:28,550 --> 03:14:32,510
By sheer luck and breaking the physics of the game.

4504
03:14:33,250 --> 03:14:35,230
The tiny apples.

4505
03:14:35,450 --> 03:14:39,050
I don't think the tiny apples are supposed to work that way, chat.

4506
03:14:39,470 --> 03:14:40,150
Hahaha.

4507
03:14:41,830 --> 03:14:45,310
I can't believe the little apples actually work.

4508
03:14:47,490 --> 03:14:47,970
Hahaha.

4509
03:14:47,970 --> 03:14:48,570
Oh my god.

4510
03:14:48,950 --> 03:14:49,430
Shit.

4511
03:14:49,950 --> 03:14:50,430
Hahaha.

4512
03:14:52,190 --> 03:14:53,690
Oh my god, guys.

4513
03:14:55,690 --> 03:14:56,530
Oh god.

4514
03:14:57,690 --> 03:15:01,950

Have a, have a play heart.

4516
03:15:04,470 --> 03:15:05,170
Thank you so much.

4517
03:15:05,210 --> 03:15:05,390
Hello.

4518
03:15:05,670 --> 03:15:06,170
Hello, hello.

4519
03:15:06,870 --> 03:15:07,350
Hahaha.

4520
03:15:10,890 --> 03:15:11,830
Oh my gosh.

4521
03:15:11,850 --> 03:15:13,630
I'm so, thanks for dreaming.

4522
03:15:13,930 --> 03:15:14,410
Hahaha.

4523
03:15:15,930 --> 03:15:19,810
I don't think this was, I was like, not, not, maybe a nightmare.

4524
03:15:20,450 --> 03:15:20,890
Hahaha.

4525
03:15:21,450 --> 03:15:21,890
Hahaha.

4526
03:15:30,410 --> 03:15:31,290
Holy shit.

4527
03:15:31,350 --> 03:15:32,610
I can't believe we did it.

4528
03:15:32,930 --> 03:15:34,150
Can't believe I did it.

4529
03:15:39,120 --> 03:15:39,760
Good times.

4530
03:15:39,760 --> 03:15:40,320
We told ya.

4531
03:15:40,460 --> 03:15:42,840
To do it up on the square and break them to you.

4532
03:15:42,980 --> 03:15:46,240
Got you real good with the spooks early in the stream though.

4533
03:15:46,620 --> 03:15:47,060
Hahaha.

4534
03:15:48,740 --> 03:15:50,820
You guys hear the, this is the whole thing.

4535
03:15:51,560 --> 03:15:52,000
Hahaha.

4536
03:15:54,240 --> 03:15:56,520
Yo, that actually freaked me the fuck out.

4537
03:15:56,560 --> 03:16:04,740
I was, I actually thought, I actually thought you guys like, fucked with me and like, I accidentally coined my way into a horror game.

4538
03:16:04,960 --> 03:16:07,540
Cause I was like, oh shit, look, puzzles, very relaxed.

4539
03:16:08,160 --> 03:16:13,260
Legitimately, the Steam was like, puzzles, very relaxing, very nice narrative.

4540
03:16:13,560 --> 03:16:14,840
I was like, oh shit, that's cool.

4541
03:16:15,180 --> 03:16:17,020
I had four hours of sleep.

4542
03:16:17,120 --> 03:16:19,540
This would be a good game to test my brain out.

4543
03:16:19,800 --> 03:16:27,900
And then, I actually thought, I was like, oh, it's like that, it's like that Doki Literature Club shit where it was like, comedy, dating sim.

4544
03:16:28,280 --> 03:16:28,640
Hahaha.

4545
03:16:30,640 --> 03:16:31,000
Babydor.

4546
03:16:31,640 --> 03:16:33,000
I miss Babydor.
