1
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,410
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,750
Hello, hello, hello!

3
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,870
Okay, welcome!

4
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,430
This is going to be my very first time playing Ark ever.

5
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,590
And like, honestly, I actually don't know how the ping is going to be like.

6
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:12,790
Because Hiro was like, you might need to get something to help you boost your ping to the server, maybe.

7
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,930
And I was like, oh, it'll be fine.

8
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,110
We'll figure this out live.

9
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,710
I should have, I might have, should have, you know, tested it out.

10
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,110
Tested out the server ping before, you know, before the stream.

11
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,250
But like, I don't know, I just believed.

12
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,390
If I believe enough, it'll be okay.

13
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,530
As long as we keep believing, it will be okay.

14
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,730
Yes, yes, welcome.

15
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,490
I've never played Ark before, guys.

16
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,970
Never in my life.

17
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,710
The reason why this we're playing Ark...

18
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:57,430
Very late at night is because this is the Bilibili VTuber server that Hiro invited me to.

19
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,930
And, you know, a majority of the people will be playing, you know, at their hours.

20
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:11,690
Not... because I was asking Hiro, I was like, oh, like, what time do usually people get on?

21
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,970
And they're like, she was like, oh, like, 4 a.m.

22
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,490
my time.

23
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,710
So I was like, maybe I should play.

24
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:18,930
Maybe not.

25
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,130
I'm just thinking, I'm gonna...

26
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:27,770
This is a compromise.

27
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,970
Like, you know, maybe not 4 a.m.

28
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,010
I don't really wanna... I don't really wanna play Ark at 4 in the morning.

29
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,310
So 11 p.m.

30
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,450
would be the best bet.

31
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,230
Thank you for the super chat.

32
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,090
Thank you, thank you.

33
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,190
Now placing bets on how she's going to pronounce Wyvern.

34
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,310
Wyvern.

35
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,370
Thank you for the super chat.

36
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,230
Thank you, thank you.

37
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,610
But yes, I have zero knowledge of this game.

38
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,030
Um...

39
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,670
And, uh...

40
00:03:59,310 --> 00:03:59,830
And...

41
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,910
I've never played Ark before, so this is gonna be interesting.

42
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:11,110
I'm ready for all the backseaters to, like, yell at me because I have no clue what the fuck to do in Ark.

43
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,470
I have zero idea what to do.

44
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:21,730
Um...

45
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,610
And...

46
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,530
Oh yeah, also a little funny update.

47
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,730
So, like, you know how, like, yesterday I was like, you know what?

48
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,970
Let's just play every copy...

49
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,390
Like, let's just play copyright songs yesterday.

50
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,430
Well, not a cop...

51
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,610
Okay, not technically...

52
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,390
Yes, like jazz.

53
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,390
Like, I mean, it's still jazz.

54
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,130
It's not like clicking...

55
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,850
Uh...

56
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,690
It's not like Disney composed a jazz song.

57
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,930
It was like a cover song of jazz.

58
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,150
But anyway...

59
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,890
I got...

60
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,170
I'm sharing revenue with Disney, Nintendo, and Ghibli.

61
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,910
Look!

62
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,830
Look!

63
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,190
If I was gonna get copyright strike...

64
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,310
If I was gonna get, like, copyright strike...

65
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,130
I want all the companies fight each other for my five dollars.

66
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,310
Like, I don't want one single company have that entire five dollars.

67
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,230
I want all of those companies fight for it.

68
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,690
So, like, in the end...

69
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,930
You know...

70
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,130
They all get, like, 50 cents a month.

71
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,730
And I'm gonna have to answer some shit.

72
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,470
Like, I don't care.

73
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,090
Now all three of them will have to share.

74
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,810
Fight, fight, fight, fight.

75
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,110
That's what I said.

76
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:35,890
That's what I was like.

77
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,150
Look, if I'm gonna be playing, like, jazz songs from...

78
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,490
If I'm gonna get striked...

79
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,350
I might as well just commit.

80
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:43,830
You know?

81
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,490
I might as well fully commit.

82
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,810
And just play all the jazz music.

83
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,070
From all the companies.

84
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,330
Like, I was gonna get...

85
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,030
I was gonna have to share revenue anyway.

86
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:54,930
Chat.

87
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:55,790
Like...

88
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,730
Like, I was gonna get striked anyway.

89
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,270
Might as well share the wealth.

90
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,990
With all the other companies.

91
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,210
Okay, bring the music down.

92
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,050
Don't worry, I got you.

93
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:09,910
Uh...

94
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,830
Alright.

95
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,750
Alright, it's time to make our...

96
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,790
Our character.

97
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,630
What do we...

98
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,270
Wait, what was the default?

99
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:21,970
Okay.

100
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,070
I could be like...

101
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,490
It's like I never went outside.

102
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,830
I never went outside and I got chucked into this world.

103
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,330
That's gonna be...

104
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,230
That's gonna be wor...

105
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,330
Wait, are we all like...

106
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,130
Oh, shit.

107
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,030
Holy shit.

108
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,210
Okay.

109
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,970
Are we all like...

110
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,630
Semi-bald?

111
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,910
Is that it?

112
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,510
Bella's a corpse?

113
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,910
I mean, we got the eyes correct.

114
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,010
Okay, head size.

115
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,610
Oh my god.

116
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,230
Okay.

117
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,130
And then...

118
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,030
What's the...

119
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,070
Oh my god!

120
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,510
What a fucking Chad!

121
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,030
Oh my god!

122
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,270
Okay.

123
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,430
Yes.

124
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,730
Wait, I can literally make it Chad?

125
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,890
Holy shit!

126
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,170
Wait a minute!

127
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,350
Wait, this changes everything.

128
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:15,690
Wait a...

129
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,730
This changes everything!

130
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,750
Oh my god!

131
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,830
Is she mewing?

132
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:22,870
Oh my god!

133
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,210
I finally did it!

134
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:25,930
Wait, okay.

135
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,730
I wanna be like semi-mewing.

136
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,330
Like, I'm still in the process of getting better at mewing.

137
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,350
Okay, what's the lower face with?

138
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,390
Alright, I need you guys to help me like read, too.

139
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,030
Because like people are typing in Chinese and I can't read.

140
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,110
So if they're like saying something that I should know, let me know.

141
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:43,890
Oh.

142
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:44,830
Oh!

143
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,070
Wait.

144
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:46,930
I don't know.

145
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:47,850
Okay.

146
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,010
Actually, I want that to be medium.

147
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,430
Because I actually really like...

148
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,870
Okay, we'll be like...

149
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,030
We'll have a smaller head because...

150
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,430
Uh...

151
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,370
No, actually...

152
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,170
Yeah, a semi-small head.

153
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,870
And...

154
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,330
Do I have to have abs?

155
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,950
Because like, I just...

156
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,970
Literally just went outside right now.

157
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,430
I went outside and I got chucked into the...

158
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,810
Apparently, this game has lore.

159
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,490
Apparently, there's an animated show that like appeared out of nowhere.

160
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,410
And it was like a star-studded cast.

161
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,250
And then everyone forgot about it.

162
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,390
Because it literally just came out of nowhere.

163
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:21,870
Like...

164
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,530
There was no advertising.

165
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,250
Oh my god.

166
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,670
There was like no advertising whatsoever.

167
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,670
But like, it was like the fucking...

168
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,050
The most star-studded cast ever.

169
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:37,730
Um...

170
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,410
Yeah, but like I heard that this game has like intense lore.

171
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,470
Okay, and then we don't have to worry about any of that.

172
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,130
Wait, hips.

173
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,190
Okay.

174
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:47,830
Yes.

175
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,710
And then...

176
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,210
I actually sort of want like nice thighs.

177
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:51,690
Ooh.

178
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,190
No.

179
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,370
Short king.

180
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,590
Short queen.

181
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:55,710
Ooh, yes.

182
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,190
Okay.

183
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,150
And then...

184
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,670
Or like chicken legs.

185
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,570
There you go.

186
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,470
Yeah.

187
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,690
I'm just like you guys, dragoons.

188
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,450
I'm just like all of you.

189
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,190
Uh...

190
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,510
Antonio, thank you for the super chat.

191
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:07,790
Thank you.

192
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,230
Thank you.

193
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,690
Thanks for sharing your hard-earned money with those poor multi-million dollar companies.

194
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,570
Truly insane.

195
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,610
Thank you for the super chat.

196
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,030
Thank you.

197
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,650
Thank you.

198
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,370
Red Dog, thank you for the super chat.

199
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:19,670
Thank you.

200
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,090
Thank you.

201
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,110
I can't believe it's been three months since your return.

202
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:30,930
My brain rot in mine back then was imagining you do Heihachi walk up from Tekken 7 coming out of the red volcanic smoke completely danced up.

203
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:31,970
Thank you for the super chat.

204
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,310
Thank you.

205
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:32,850
Thank you.

206
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,070
Um...

207
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,610
Alright.

208
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,270
I think that's perfect.

209
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,250
Alright.

210
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,130
Real...

211
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,110
Email...

212
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:42,690
Doki.

213
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:43,630
There you go.

214
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,310
Community survivor.

215
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,970
I think that's...

216
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,910
I think that's good.

217
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,290
If I'm too sh- like...

218
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,670
Uh...

219
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,490
If I'm too short, then like people will have a harder time hitting me.

220
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,690
Because like they'll aim for head level.

221
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,250
But like I'm so short that like my head level isn't head level.

222
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,190
So...

223
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,070
Ah!

224
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,830
Flashbang!

225
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,590
Alright, let's see.

226
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,610
Let's see how bad the ping is.

227
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,500
Alright.

228
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,800
To like halfway for having never paid attention to music.

229
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,060
Okay, let's make sure you're cold.

230
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,300
You should find some warmth soon.

231
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,260
Oh, okay.

232
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,920
Is there like free inventory?

233
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,340
Wait, what's this?

234
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,500
What the fuck are...

235
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,560
Is this free stuff?

236
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,800
Oh!

237
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,180
It's free stuff!

238
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:30,980
Right?

239
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,800
Did they give me free stuff?

240
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,840
Okay, let me like fix the sound real quick.

241
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,660
Okay.

242
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,800
Music...

243
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,780
Oh my god!

244
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,920
I get free stuff!

245
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,560
Dude, everybody's so nice!

246
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,440
Okay.

247
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,920
Uh...

248
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,600
How do...

249
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,780
Where's the fucking sense?

250
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,360
Where's the sense of...

251
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,380
Oh, there we go.

252
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,080
No camera shake, please.

253
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,320
Uh...

254
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,800
We're gonna turn that down.

255
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,820
Fucking hate camera shake.

256
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,240
I'm sorry.

257
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,980
I think camera shake is dumb.

258
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,660
I don't care about immersiveness.

259
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,680
Alright, here we go.

260
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,440
Wait, what can I take?

261
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:07,640
Oh, there's a...

262
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,640
Okay, I'm gonna take...

263
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,540
Wait, what is my...

264
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,140
Is this my inventory?

265
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,660
Wait, I already have armor.

266
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,380
Um, how do I open my inventory?

267
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,980
Is this...

268
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:21,840
Okay.

269
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,320
How do I...

270
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,460
Oh my god, I'm already overwhelmed.

271
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,420
Wait, why can't I put it on?

272
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,460
Did I put it on?

273
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,820
Or did I put it away?

274
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,560
No, I put it away.

275
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,620
What did I put...

276
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,260
This is it.

277
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:37,640
Oh, I can't...

278
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:38,920
I...

279
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,660
Oh, okay.

280
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,620
I...

281
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,340
Oh my god, I'm beautiful.

282
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,580
Okay, equipped.

283
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,740
Okay, equip.

284
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,460
Equip.

285
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,360
Equipped.

286
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,220
Uh...

287
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,680
Wait, I have so many things.

288
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,180
That's crazy.

289
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,700
I have so many things.

290
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,860
Put this in my head.

291
00:11:59,500 --> 00:11:59,800
I...

292
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,020
Your insert tutorial for...

293
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,320
Wait, I leveled up from existing!

294
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,700
God, I wish that was like real life.

295
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,620
Okay, I'm gonna...

296
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,760
Wait, what should I...

297
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,820
What should I get?

298
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,400
I leveled up just for existing!

299
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,560
I love it!

300
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,560
Uh...

301
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,500
I hope you have some knowledge of herbivores and carnivores.

302
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,120
If it looks threatening, it probably is.

303
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,020
Just beware, even if they're small...

304
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,080
Alex, thank you for the super chat.

305
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,520
Thank you.

306
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,120
Thank you.

307
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,720
Alright, what do I get?

308
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,040
HP?

309
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:31,700
Okay.

310
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,320
Whoa!

311
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,900
Oh my gosh.

312
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,480
I feel like I should get a pickaxe.

313
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:37,620
Oh, I got a pickaxe.

314
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,000
Right?

315
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,520
I wanna make a pickaxe.

316
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,640
That's what I want to make.

317
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,780
Alright guys...

318
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,160
Wait, there's stuff over there.

319
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,760
Alright guys, here we go.

320
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,080
There's so much...

321
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,560
Wait, there's colours over there.

322
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,960
Do you think that's a good colour?

323
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,740
Do you think that's friendly?

324
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:01,920
Hello?

325
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,060
Wait, there's so many colours around the world.

326
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,620
Wait, are those...

327
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,440
Are those friendly colors?

328
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,120
Are those...

329
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,740
Woah!

330
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,760
That must be friendly!

331
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,600
AHHHHH!

332
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,120
That's not fair!

333
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,920
That's not fair!

334
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,960
I was following...

335
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,320
I was just...

336
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,180
I was just following the colors!

337
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,540
Nooooo!

338
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,940
All my items!

339
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,700
I had so many items!

340
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,140
I was rich!

341
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,540
Oh, I still have it.

342
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,220
Oh, thank god.

343
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,900
Thank god I still have it.

344
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,060
Hey guys, I still got it.

345
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,360
Nice.

346
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,400
Okay, everything's fine.

347
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:58,980
Okay.

348
00:13:59,380 --> 00:13:59,860
Alright.

349
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,940
Oh my god, wait!

350
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,400
I can... I can have costumes and dodo birds?

351
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,200
How do I get the dodo bird?

352
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,060
Guys, I'm okay guys.

353
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:09,780
Alright.

354
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,600
Everything is okay.

355
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,960
We're off to a good start.

356
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,100
We're off to a good start.

357
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,480
We're off to a good start.

358
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:19,620
Guys...

359
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,580
I keep following the...

360
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,260
Guys!

361
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,060
Guys!

362
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,560
Following the colors is very dangerous.

363
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,740
I'm like those flies that follow the bright colors.

364
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:43,020
You know like those flies that follow the zapper and you're like ooooooo Follow the zapper!

365
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,120
You're tired?

366
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,860
Stop moving?

367
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,540
Ooo pretty colors!

368
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,020
Wait, is this where I died?

369
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,980
Okay, we can easily fix this.

370
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,280
Wait, how the fuck...

371
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,600
AHHHH!

372
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,260
Wait, Santa Claus?

373
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,100
What is that?

374
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,560
It's okay.

375
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,260
We're back.

376
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,200
That's the fact.

377
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,660
Look!

378
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,440
It's still Santa!

379
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,940
I got distracted by Santa!

380
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,320
It's okay.

381
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,040
Round 3.

382
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,920
I got distracted by Santa!

383
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,140
I heard a ho ho ho!

384
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,840
Okay, let's turn up the gamma.

385
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:29,740
Alright.

386
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,600
I know a lot of you guys kept yelling at me to turn up.

387
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,060
Wait, how do you turn up gamma?

388
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,940
Where is that?

389
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,220
Where the fuck is that?

390
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,020
There's a gamma?

391
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,840
Can you actually...

392
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,900
Are you guys fucking with me?

393
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,800
Yeah, it's a tab.

394
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,680
I don't know if you guys are fucking with me.

395
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,000
Or if there's actual like...

396
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,020
It's oddly under key bindings.

397
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,680
It is?

398
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,760
Okay.

399
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,120
Where is it?

400
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:56,880
Oh, there you go.

401
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,520
Do we do gamma 1 or gamma 2?

402
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,960
Do we do gamma 1 or gamma 2?

403
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,880
Tab, type, gamma...

404
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,680
Tab, type, gamma...

405
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,100
And type...

406
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,300
Should this be 3 or 4?

407
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,580
Oh wait, you guys can't see.

408
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,840
Is it gamma 1 or 2?

409
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,100
Is it gamma 1 or 2?

410
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,380
Guys...

411
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,300
Guys, which one is it?

412
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
1 or 2?

413
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,060
Yes.

414
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:23,800
Thanks.

415
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,900
That's very helpful.

416
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,960
Okay, I'm gonna put 3.

417
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,320
Alright.

418
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,440
That should be fine.

419
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,860
Okay.

420
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,580
Good.

421
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,720
Alright.

422
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,980
Did it fix anything?

423
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,640
Did it fix anything, guys?

424
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,000
Because I can't tell.

425
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,540
Oh, we bring down the music a little bit more.

426
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:51,880
Okay.

427
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,020
Bring it down a little bit more.

428
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,220
Yeah, I can't...

429
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,260
Oh, I didn't hit apply.

430
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,560
Sorry, I'm a little special.

431
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,020
There we go.

432
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,440
That should work.

433
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,780
Did it fix anything?

434
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,080
I should've asked Hiro to like help me explore note.

435
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,580
I should've asked Hiro to like help me explore note.

436
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,320
Oh my god, lore!

437
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,980
You might be.

438
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,340
I hope so.

439
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,180
It's been so many cycles since I was hurt.

440
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,800
It's been so many cycles since I was hurt.

441
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,540
Do I even still remember hope?

442
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,200
Do I even still remember hope?

443
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,280
I wasn't sure you'd ever turn up.

444
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:29,880
I wasn't sure you'd ever turn up.

445
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,220
That's me.

446
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,980
I'm here to save your life.

447
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,700
Don't mind about all the other dead Doki's behind me, but I'm here.

448
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,620
You can count on me.

449
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,600
I'm very reliable.

450
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,920
You have to reach me.

451
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,900
Everything depends on your survival.

452
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,340
My survival?

453
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,240
Master this well.

454
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,620
Whoa, bet on the wrong person.

455
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,940
I have to save you, Doki number one and two.

456
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,480
Did not do so well in this world.

457
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,200
Just like I did so long ago.

458
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,700
Never and find me, survivor.

459
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,420
Bad news.

460
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,620
You may be the only one who can.

461
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,460
But I'm not.

462
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:12,620
I'm not.

463
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,540
Me?

464
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,360
Really?

465
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm the only one?

466
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,460
Oh shit.

467
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,940
Oh lore.

468
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,840
Okay.

469
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,140
Cool.

470
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,860
Where's the...

471
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,820
Where's my mouse?

472
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,920
Oh there it is.

473
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,800
Nice.

474
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,020
I got lore.

475
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,340
Nice.

476
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,760
Oh level up is available?

477
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:36,980
Okay.

478
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,360
I can level up now.

479
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,300
Alright, what do we get guys?

480
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,420
Is it still health?

481
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,540
Is it...

482
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,080
Is it still health?

483
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,960
Do we really need Gamma 4?

484
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,080
Do we really need... Wait.

485
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,780
Oh okay.

486
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,880
Okay, wait.

487
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:53,980
Yay!

488
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,220
Alright.

489
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,220
I leveled up.

490
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,320
I'm slowly learning.

491
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,120
Okay, let me...

492
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,900
Apparently people keep yelling at me to do Gamma 4.

493
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,660
Gamma 4.

494
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,100
Whoa!

495
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,320
Guys!

496
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,500
This is a whole different game.

497
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,020
This is a whole different game.

498
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,060
Oh my god!

499
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,940
Oh my god!

500
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,320
Whoa!

501
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,860
What the fuck?

502
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,820
This is a different game now.

503
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,160
This is a different game now.

504
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,140
We can see it now.

505
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:30,360
We can see it now.

506
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,380
Holy shit.

507
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,880
Is this where I died like three times?

508
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,620
Or two times?

509
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,160
Oh yeah, that's definitely where I died two times.

510
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,260
The two time champion.

511
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:39,700
The two time champion.

512
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,660
Alright.

513
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,360
I don't know where to go.

514
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,220
There's apparently like ten people on the server right now.

515
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,460
Alright.

516
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,580
Where do we... Ooh look!

517
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,160
Look at all the dinosaurs!

518
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,500
That's a herbivore!

519
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,500
Right there!

520
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,580
I know my dinosaurs!

521
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,120
That's a triceratops.

522
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,460
And then that's a brontosaurus.

523
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,140
You think I'll live?

524
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,540
Doki number three is gonna find out.

525
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,880
Oh!

526
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,280
Doki number three is okay.

527
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,680
Yay!

528
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,560
Ooh.

529
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,100
Ooh.

530
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,540
Doki number three is gonna figure out how to parkour this.

531
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,460
Doki number three is gonna figure out how to parkour this.

532
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,840
Uhhhh...

533
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:23,920
See?

534
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,040
Doki number three is learning from one and two!

535
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:27,640
Doki number three is learning from one and two!

536
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,260
This is bad.

537
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,160
Alright, here.

538
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,560
I'm gonna go to the other side.

539
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,120
Alright, here.

540
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,100
Alright.

541
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:37,980
Alright.

542
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,920
There's no way I die from this.

543
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,180
Alright, Doki number four coming in hot.

544
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,860
I keep getting inked.

545
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,920
Don't worry.

546
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:02,220
Doki number four has learned from all the mistakes from all the other Dokis.

547
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,800
All the other...

548
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,520
All the other Dokis.

549
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
They've learned.

550
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,960
They have learned.

551
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,140
Don't worry.

552
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:11,740
It's fine.

553
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,760
There's gonna be so much armor.

554
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,020
I don't know where to go.

555
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,880
Where's the map?

556
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,740
Oh, there's the map.

557
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,640
What the fuck?

558
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,680
That's just it?

559
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,660
That's just all the map?

560
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,300
That's me, right there.

561
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,020
Alright.

562
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,860
Is there like any way I can go?

563
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,280
I feel like I'm like locked in here.

564
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,100
Like, I feel like I'm actually locked in here.

565
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,880
I can touch nowhere else.

566
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,100
Alright.

567
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,500
Let's see.

568
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,120
Icing, thank you for the super chat.

569
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,460
Thank you.

570
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,020
Thank you.

571
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,600
Wait.

572
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,460
There has to be like somewhere I can go.

573
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,620
How do I leave?

574
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,360
Punch a tree?

575
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,520
But I don't wanna live here.

576
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,360
I wanna find like a nice place to live.

577
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,800
Jesus Christ.

578
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,140
Those are all my dead bodies.

579
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,040
There's too many.

580
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,040
It's okay.

581
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,820
It's fine.

582
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,280
We'll figure this out live.

583
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,720
Oh, dragonflies!

584
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,020
Can I eat these?

585
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,080
Can I eat you guys?

586
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,660
Wait.

587
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,680
Wait, they hurt back?

588
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,080
Oh my god!

589
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,120
There's so many!

590
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,800
Oh.

591
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,880
Okay, that's fine.

592
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,640
That's fine.

593
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,420
There is like a fucking clan!

594
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,460
Yeah.

595
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,040
Decomposes...

596
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:36,900
170?!

597
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,840
How the fuck do I farm you?

598
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,940
Oh, I got it.

599
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,800
I got raw meat!

600
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,380
From fucking insects?

601
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,660
Hey guys, I got some raw meat.

602
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,300
Wait, where are the other ones that I killed?

603
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,860
I swear.

604
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,300
There's like more.

605
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,300
It's okay.

606
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,080
Guys, I'm learning.

607
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,200
I got raw meat now.

608
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,180
I did it.

609
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,680
Yay!

610
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,840
Oh, I should punch some trees.

611
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,840
Oh, that's a lot.

612
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,020
What the fuck?

613
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,060
I'm strong as hell.

614
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,360
Oh my god.

615
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,640
Did you guys see that?

616
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,100
I'm so fucking strong.

617
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,060
Those look like herbivores.

618
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,740
Wait, all of them look like herbivores.

619
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,940
Except for that one raptor.

620
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,840
I can harvest a bush for berries.

621
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,260
But I'm not hungry yet, I think.

622
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,300
How do I get water though?

623
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,400
I wonder.

624
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,100
Wait, that doesn't look like a herbivore.

625
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,980
Why are they like the herbivores?

626
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,960
No, they're all herbivores.

627
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,440
They're all friends.

628
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,500
Guys, they're all friends.

629
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,740
Watch this guys.

630
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,380
Wait, this tree is still alive.

631
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,020
Oh, never mind.

632
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,040
Yay!

633
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,420
Bro, I'm so fucking strong.

634
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,180
Is that poop?

635
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,960
We might need this.

636
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,380
Wait, somebody dropped it.

637
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,220
Thank you.

638
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:58,900
I'm so sorry.

639
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,420
I'm so sorry.

640
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,620
I can't believe they would waste good fertilizer like that.

641
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,300
I can't believe they would waste good fertilizer like that.

642
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,220
Poop is good fertilizer.

643
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,640
Are you friend shaped?

644
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,400
Are you friend shaped?

645
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,340
Are you friend shaped?

646
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,800
It's fine.

647
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,700
He doesn't know how to fly.

648
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,180
Get over here.

649
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,420
You don't know how to...

650
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,060
Get over here.

651
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,700
I'm hungry.

652
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:26,800
I agree.

653
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:27,620
Oh.

654
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,320
Dine is canon.

655
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,080
And lord, you learn from your past life mistakes.

656
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,820
It's so funny.

657
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,320
Doki5 is canon.

658
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,880
Victory, thank you for the super chat.

659
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,840
I can't believe it.

660
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,600
It ran away.

661
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,620
Why would it run away from me?

662
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,720
I've been nothing but kind.

663
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,180
Oh, there's so many dinos.

664
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,440
Okay, let me look at my inventory.

665
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,620
Because I can upgrade again.

666
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,480
What should I get, guys?

667
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,840
Wait, I'm slowly Really starving.

668
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,920
Cook my meat?

669
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,340
But how do I make fire?

670
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,660
I haven't learned yet.

671
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,500
What do I get guys?

672
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,320
Weight?

673
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,620
Okay, I'll do more weight.

674
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,860
No, because then I'll get sick.

675
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,480
This is like good fertilizer.

676
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,920
I'm not gonna waste good fertilizer chat.

677
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,360
That's crazy.

678
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,260
Guys...

679
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,680
Where did my mouse go?

680
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,920
I... Oh, there it is.

681
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,840
I was like where the fuck did I...

682
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,660
Wait, I have so many points of...

683
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,760
Oh my god, I've leveled up so much.

684
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,180
Wait.

685
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,180
Speed, stamina, HP and weight.

686
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,500
Okay, stamina...

687
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,240
Speed...

688
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,120
Stamina... There's apparently like a lot of mods too for this game.

689
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:48,780
Okay.

690
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,260
Wait.

691
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,060
Is my stomach... Do I have issues?

692
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,980
Don't answer that.

693
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,560
Not speed?

694
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,240
But people are saying...

695
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,660
High level... Because I fucking destroyed a tree in one hit.

696
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,200
What do you mean?

697
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,040
Why do I need oxygen?

698
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Just fucking breathe.

699
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,160
Let's see... A little bit of melee damage.

700
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,540
Okay, we have three more.

701
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,700
Speed till 200%?

702
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,460
You mean this?

703
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,940
Movement speed?

704
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,240
What about crafting?

705
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,600
Or fortitude?

706
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,820
What the fuck is fortitude?

707
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,320
Chemiris does matter now?

708
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,100
Oh, okay.

709
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,080
Upgrade my speed.

710
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,320
And then...

711
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,980
Just breathe.

712
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,000
I don't understand.

713
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,460
I still wanna make a...

714
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,580
Oh, I can make a stone hatchet.

715
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,120
Wait, I can make a gun?

716
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,240
Oh my god.

717
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,180
Guys, I can make a fucking gun.

718
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,220
Alright.

719
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,700
Just like Palworld.

720
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,420
What else can I make?

721
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,340
Let's see.

722
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,940
Well, I don't really need clothes.

723
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,000
I already have clothes.

724
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,960
Oh, I should get like a sleeping bag.

725
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,800
And then... Oh, a saddle!

726
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,340
I like saddles.

727
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,920
Oh, and a regular bed?

728
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,040
I learned so many.

729
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,180
Oh my god, look at all these things that I learned.

730
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,040
There's so much stuff.

731
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,200
I'm getting overwhelmed right now.

732
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,220
Alright, let's find a house.

733
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,880
I wanna be next to somebody.

734
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,260
Would it be rude if I make my...

735
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,500
If I make it next to somebody's house?

736
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,060
Where did I poop?

737
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,360
Is that my poop?

738
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,100
Pick up?

739
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,640
Sure.

740
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,520
I mean, it's good.

741
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,200
It's fertilizer.

742
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,040
I'm not gonna waste good old fertilizer.

743
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,220
Okay.

744
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,060
Am I hungry yet?

745
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,540
Okay, we need to make like...

746
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,320
How do I craft?

747
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:45,900
Alright.

748
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,540
Oh my god, look at all this fertilizer!

749
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,520
Wait, somebody dropped this!

750
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,400
Wait, somebody was next to me!

751
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,500
See?

752
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,660
Somebody dropped this!

753
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,140
They were next to me!

754
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,620
They dropped all this good-ass poop!

755
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,600
Look at that!

756
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,220
Okay, uh...

757
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,640
How do I craft, chat?

758
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,800
How do I...

759
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
How do I craft?

760
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,760
Oh my god.

761
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,040
You've been...

762
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,840
How did I get poisoned?!

763
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,400
Stop!

764
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,700
Bro!

765
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,540
I was just existing!

766
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,880
That's so fucked up!

767
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,360
Oh!

768
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:26,660
Oh!

769
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:41,110
I was just existing!

770
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,050
No!

771
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,500
That's not fair!

772
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,180
I was starting to learn!

773
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,120
I just...

774
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,600
I just wanted to exist!

775
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,940
It's not fair!

776
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,360
That's not fair!

777
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,960
Doki number 5 is here!

778
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,740
I don't even know where Doki number 4 went!

779
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,480
Where did Doki number 4 go?

780
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,780
I can't believe I died to fucking up bullshit.

781
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,760
I'm so sad.

782
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,320
Doki number 5!

783
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,720
Doki number five!

784
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,540
Where did Doki number four die?

785
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,620
Doki number five has to figure this shit out.

786
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,260
Where the fuck did I die?

787
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,960
The drive-by!

788
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,660
I can't believe it!

789
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,200
Wait, Hiro's on!

790
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,160
You have made an enemy at the super save mega level bugs.

791
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,940
Doki is doomed!

792
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,200
Doki number four was doomed!

793
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,620
Doki number five still has a chance!

794
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,180
Wait, is this where I died?

795
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,660
This could be where I died.

796
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,560
There's so many dead bodies.

797
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,340
Wait, there's somebody else died to my right.

798
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,900
Alright, don't worry guys.

799
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,940
Doki number five is gonna be okay.

800
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,200
Alright.

801
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,420
It's okay.

802
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,460
It's not like the other... the others are not here to kill me.

803
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,160
What the fuck?

804
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,800
How are there still bugs?

805
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,040
How are you fucking camping my body?

806
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,800
Oh my god!

807
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,980
He's literally camping my body!

808
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,840
Bruh!

809
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,600
That's so fucked up.

810
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,540
That is so fucked up!

811
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,360
This is not fair!

812
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,520
Leave me alone!

813
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,080
I just want my life!

814
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,020
Welcome to the heart!

815
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,480
No!

816
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,220
Guys, Doki number six can clutch this.

817
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,960
Guys, I hate this area.

818
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,660
I hate this spot.

819
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,500
Don't worry.

820
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,560
Doki number six has figured stuff out.

821
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,280
Doki number six has figured it all out, guys.

822
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,960
Guys, do not worry.

823
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,640
Okay.

824
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,000
We're gonna get our shit back.

825
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,220
I'm just gonna look at the logs and it's just like Doki dead.

826
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,280
Doki has died.

827
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,320
Somebody made a fire!

828
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,600
Wait!

829
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,600
Who was here?

830
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,020
Somebody was just here and I missed them.

831
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,380
I can't believe it!

832
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,720
Somebody was just here and I actually missed them.

833
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,060
Okay.

834
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,720
Where did I die?

835
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,440
Wait.

836
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,540
Oh, there it is.

837
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,080
There's my stuff.

838
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,940
Doki 20 is not as far as I thought.

839
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,020
Okay.

840
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,500
The bugs can't hit you.

841
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,000
Are you prone?

842
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,820
That is so smart.

843
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,940
That's so smart.

844
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,280
Okay.

845
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,760
There's no way the bugs would be all the way here.

846
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,500
There's no fucking way.

847
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,840
Right?

848
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,520
Oh.

849
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

850
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,540
No!

851
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,640
This is so fucked up!

852
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,000
Are you fucking... Bro, he's actually camping me!

853
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,060
Bro!

854
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,480
I'm so mad!

855
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,060
Oh my god!

856
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,100
Bro, let me have...

857
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,480
Bro, leave me alone!

858
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,610
Please!

859
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,170
I just want to...

860
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:57,810
My stuff!

861
00:32:59,010 --> 00:32:59,970
Leave me alone!

862
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:01,570
No!

863
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,910
Insect 3.

864
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,210
Doki 0.

865
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,590
No!

866
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,170
I need...

867
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:11,910
Oh my god!

868
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,590
The worst part is like he's just slowly killing me.

869
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,790
He actually is just slowly fucking me up.

870
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,330
This is it.

871
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,950
Doki 7 has learned everything she could learn.

872
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,930
To fucking...

873
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,730
Um... beat Ark.

874
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,790
Not good at the whole...

875
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,470
Oh, I'm sorry!

876
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:37,070
There's like a fucking level 300 bug fucking camping my body.

877
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,130
Like, what the fuck do I do?

878
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,350
Oh my god.

879
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,150
Okay.

880
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:46,970
It's okay.

881
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,950
We'll be fine.

882
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:48,950
We'll be fine.

883
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,630
Doki 7 has figured things out.

884
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,050
Doki 8 is in a death loop.

885
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,390
Alright, don't worry.

886
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,530
We'll figure this out.

887
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,250
Oh my god.

888
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,030
It's so bright now.

889
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,310
There's no way it camps me again!

890
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,390
There's no fucking way!

891
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:09,990
Alright, we're gonna go around.

892
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,670
There he is!

893
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,910
There he fucking is!

894
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,670
He just flew above me like a little whore!

895
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,490
Okay, to be fair, all bugs are technically whores because like...

896
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,550
They make a lot of babies and they also fuck a lot.

897
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,410
So like, it's like scientifically accurate if you think about it.

898
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:33,850
Because all they do when they are born is just they wanna bang.

899
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,350
And then when they wanna bang and make babies.

900
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,970
So technically all insects are whores.

901
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,710
Oh my god.

902
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,790
Thank fucking god I got my shit back.

903
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,830
Doki what?

904
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,310
It's true!

905
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,490
The moment they're like outside...

906
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:59,350
The moment they're like outside the pupa stage.

907
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,410
All they wanna do is bang.

908
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:04,890
So scientifically all insects are whores.

909
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,810
We will not listen to this slander.

910
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,390
Holy shit!

911
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,390
I cannot see!

912
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:16,130
Okay, I need a fucking gamma 3 or some shit.

913
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,250
This is way too bright for me.

914
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:21,610
Okay.

915
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,190
Alright.

916
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,770
Let's see.

917
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,850
Where do I go?

918
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:27,890
Wait, is that friend?

919
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:29,990
That's a bear.

920
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,130
Wait.

921
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,290
Are you friend?

922
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,570
Are you friend?

923
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,130
Hello?

924
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:39,850
Do you...

925
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:40,890
Oh my god!

926
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,210
I'm getting flash banged.

927
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,930
Wait, can I... Can they be my pet?

928
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,930
You wanna be... Do you wanna join me?

929
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,470
Do you wanna join me?

930
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,650
Why are you running away?

931
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,610
Why are you running away?

932
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,350
I want... I want him to...

933
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,330
Check settings.

934
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,310
Oh, I can turn off bloom?

935
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,910
Okay guys, thank you.

936
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,690
Where's bloom?

937
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:06,730
Motion blur.

938
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,430
Oh, light bloom.

939
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,130
Yeah, fuck that.

940
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,570
That is terrible.

941
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:12,970
Oh my god.

942
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:13,530
Oh my god.

943

00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,650
Because he's... he hasn't walked around the map yet.

1276
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:17,910

Okay, this looks...

1289
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,100
It's not really our house.

1290
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,680
It's like a place where we can like...

1291
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,440
Oh, it's a store where all the pets and stuff?

1292

Oh my god, there's so many pets!

1296
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:02,880
Can they die?

1297
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,020
They can die.

1298
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,340
Wait, if I actually stab them, they'll die?

1299
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,820
Yeah, they'll get hurt.

1300
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:11,720
Oh, okay.

1301
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,680
Okay, I think you should heal your otter.

1302
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,900
I stabbed your otter earlier.

1303
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,500
On accident.

1304
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,280

1311
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,020

1317
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,400
We don't know the rules!

1318
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,020
We can do it.

1319
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,160

1320
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,800

00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,700
Yeah, she's another...

1323
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,560
She's a VTuber.

1324
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,080
She sings a lot.

1325
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:03,580
Oh!

1326
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,460
She should do a concert for us.

1327
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,000
Oh my god, do you guys farm these animals for poop?

1328
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:10,920
Uh...

1329
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,960
Della's so cool.

1330
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,280
I think she's farming poop.

1331
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,900
Yeah, I was gonna say!

1332
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,400
Is she farming them for poop?

1333
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,260
Oh my god.

1334
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,500
Oh my god.

1335
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,060
Guys, I have a house now!

1336
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:25,800
Guys!

1337
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,740
I have a house and I didn't have to work for it!

1338
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,660
I love it here.

1339
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,500
Oh.

1340
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,720
The poop fire.

1341
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:46,590
Oh my god.

1342
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,150
I want my poop.

1343
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:50,890
I want my own... I want my own mount.

1344
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,850
Wait, I... Oh yeah, I have to make a bed!

1345
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:55,610
Okay, guys.

1346
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,010
Alright, I need to get a bed.

1347
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,750
Wait, I'm gonna die of thirst.

1348
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,490
I just realized.

1349
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:00,550
I am so thirsty.

1350
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:02,790
Uhhhh...

1351
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:04,770
Where's the water?

1352
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:06,750
Oh, there it is.

1353
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:07,950
Consume.

1354
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:10,270
Alright, not thirsty anymore.

1355
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:11,130
Let's go.

1356
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:13,450
I'm a squatter?

1357
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,790
I'm not a squatter!

1358
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:18,230
I provide, like, entertainment!

1359
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:19,110
I provide, like, entertainment!

1360
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:20,430
Guys...

1361
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:22,590
It gave me a bikini!

1362
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,150
I'm trying to thirst.

1363
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:26,530
Yeah, yeah, I'm really... Yeah, I need water.

1364
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:26,790
Yeah.

1365
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:28,070
Yeah.

1366
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:29,610
Also, they...

1367
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:32,110
Actually, this is really nice.

1368
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,710
Oh my god.

1369
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:35,830
Level 300?

1370
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,330
Who the fuck caught that?

1371
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:42,550
To catch...

1372
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:46,050
Oh, yeah.

1373
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:48,570
I wanna catch, like, a flying thing too.

1374
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:49,970
Oh, food.

1375
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:50,850
Yeah, not...

1376
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:01,650
I don't need food.

1377
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,030
I'm starving, apparently.

1378
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,610
Yeah, I'm hungry.

1379
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:09,890
Oh, okay.

1380
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,710
Do I just swim and then I drink water?

1381
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:15,770
Oh, nice!

1382
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,230
I'm learning.

1383
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:21,250
Oh!

1384
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:22,130
How do I...

1385
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:23,570
How do I...

1386
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:25,210
Oh my god, I'm glitching out!

1387
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:29,610
I'm here.

1388
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:30,030
Oh!

1389
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:31,770
I'm okay!

1390
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:34,430
Alright.

1391
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:35,410
This...

1392
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:36,650
Yeah...

1393
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,490
There's, like, a thousand water bottles...

1394
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:42,590
...in a big, big thing.

1395
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:43,490
Wait, are you dying?

1396
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:44,630
Oh, what?

1397
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:45,410
She's bleeding!

1398
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:46,830
What the fuck?

1399
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:51,930
Here's the...

1400
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,630
Where's the food?

1401
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:55,410
You...

1402
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:56,710
Food's okay.

1403
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:57,850
I'll feed you.

1404
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:58,710
Feed me.

1405
00:50:58,990 --> 00:50:59,950
Feed me.

1406
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:00,910
I'm baby.

1407
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:04,550
Oh, nice!

1408
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:06,050
Alright.

1409
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:09,150
I think we need to start by...

1410
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:10,870
...going to the beach.

1411
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:12,890
Oh my god, our beach episode.

1412
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:15,590
Beach episode.

1413
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:17,950
Yeah, we're having our beach episode right now.

1414
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:19,690
What the fuck?

1415
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:21,030
Did you... She's catching it.

1416
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,930
Put food in inventory to tame.

1417
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:26,350
Put food in inventory to tame.

1418
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:28,610
I didn't give it food.

1419
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:31,810
So, to tame something, you can put...

1420
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:34,710
...meat or berries in your inventory...

1421
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:35,830
...of your safe.

1422
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:36,570
Yeah?

1423
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:38,990
You wanna try?

1424
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:40,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1425
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:41,950
I put food in this inventory.

1426
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,160
Is it...

1427
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:47,880
Is it taming?

1428
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,900
Oh, it needs berries?

1429
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,060
Yeah, I'll give it to you.

1430
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,100
Do I have berries?

1431
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,140
It's

1432
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:02,680
five minutes.

1433
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,220
Oh.

1434
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,000
Okay.

1435
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:07,320
Alright.

1436
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,760
You put the meat in it...

1437
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,200
Yeah, yeah.

1438
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,740
Okay, and then it'll eventually become my friend?

1439
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,520
Yeah.

1440
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,860
So, it's taming is...

1441
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:18,900
...percent now, right?

1442
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,280
Oh, he hit it!

1443
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,640
He left it in the...

1444
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,440
...taming.

1445
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:25,620
Oh, oops.

1446
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,700
I'm stuck.

1447
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,780
Guys, I'm stuck.

1448
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,220
I'm stuck!

1449
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:34,700
I'm stuck!

1450
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:34,720
No!

1451
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,940
Oh, I'm okay, I'm okay.

1452
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:38,920
Is he...

1453
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,960
You wanna be friend?

1454
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,100
Oh, 63%!

1455
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,040
Okay.

1456
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:47,740
Yay!

1457
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:48,680
Friend!

1458
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,560
Yay!

1459
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,580
Oh my god.

1460
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,240
Wait, you can make babies with them!

1461
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,040
Because... right?

1462
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,020
Because they...

1463
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:03,700
...female.

1464
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,500
Oh!

1465
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,140
Do you guys have the female?

1466
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,240
Can my male...

1467
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,460
Can my male guy bang your female and make...

1468
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:11,920
...female.

1469
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,700
I don't have a female.

1470
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,880
I don't have a male.

1471
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:18,940
Okay, 63%.

1472
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:20,680
Hello.

1473
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,920
Well, this is just a normal one.

1474
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:24,080
You don't have to...

1475
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:24,940
...uh...

1476
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,360
...s in it.

1477
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:26,620
You

1478
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:31,030
don't have to...

1479
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:33,290
Oh, I see, I see.

1480
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:34,350
I'm learning.

1481
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:36,290

00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,220

00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,000
Oh, I see.

1484
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:48,580
I

1485
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:56,650
have a dragon!

1486
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:58,050
I'm playing.

1487
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:01,910
Oh my god, look guys!

1488
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:03,350
Oh my god, look guys!

1489
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:04,650
It's you, dragons!

1490
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:05,790
That's you!

1491
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:05,870
That's you!

1492
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:09,850
No!

1493
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:10,790
No, I'm sorry!

1494
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,490
Oh, he's flying away!

1495
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,490
Why is he flying away?

1496
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:15,570
I'm so sorry!

1497
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:19,270
I'm so sorry!

1498
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,230
I'm so sorry!

1499
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:21,250
I'm so sorry!

1500
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:22,370
Oh, saddle.

1501
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:23,830
Equip saddle...

1502
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:24,170
...to ride.

1503
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:26,270
Do I have a saddle?

1504
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:28,850
Oh, do you guys have a saddle?

1505
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:31,130
Yeah!

1506
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:37,610
Oh, okay.

1507
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:39,110
Alright.

1508
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:41,750
Uhhh...

1509
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:41,870

You have a strong accent.

1596
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:28,370
Nice.

1597
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,150

Hiro!

1601
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:33,870
They gave me a bikini.

1602
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:36,670
So now they take care of me, now.

1603
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:38,150
Oh!

1604
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:41,550

1605
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:43,290
Can I join your tribe?

1606
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:45,110
Really?

1607
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:45,790
Will you join your tribe?

1608
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:47,050
Yeah, yeah, can I...

1609
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:49,390
I can join Hiro's family.

1610
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:55,210
But they have a gun.

1611
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:57,210
Hiro, where's your gun?

1612
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:57,650
Hiro?

1613
00:58:58,270 --> 00:58:59,250
Okay, okay.

1614
00:58:59,310 --> 00:58:59,630
Hiro!

1615
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:02,430
They said they wanted to go in your room.

1616
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:05,790
Yes, I said why not go in your room?

1617
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,750
They don't have guns.

1618
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:22,270
They have guns but they don't shoot us.

1619
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:25,750
You have guns?

1620
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:26,770
Oh sorry.

1621
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:28,690
They don't shoot us.

1622
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:35,930
It's okay, I was joking here.

1623
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:37,370
I would never leave your tribe.

1624
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:38,810
It was a joke.

1625
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:45,630
I can't give you too much things but I can give you a few.

1626
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:46,530
Thank you!

1627
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:48,450
Oh my god, thank you!

1628
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:50,150
Don't be hungry.

1629
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,630
Thank you for taking care of me.

1630
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:54,210
Don't worry, I'll dance for you.

1631
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:56,370
I'll dance for you.

1632
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:57,050
Don't worry.

1633
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:58,630
Here, you wanna see the back?

1634
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:08,290
Oh, okay.

1635
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:15,770
Guys, their house is so much better!

1636
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:20,550
No shame!

1637
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:22,370
What the fuck!

1638
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:23,810
Oh my god!

1639
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:25,470
That's beautiful!

1640
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:30,050
She will... she will...

1641
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:32,930
She will... burn a baby after two minutes.

1642
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:33,270
Really?

1643
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:35,310
Can I keep the baby?

1644
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:38,270
Just wait two minutes.

1645
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:38,750
Okay.

1646
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:41,110
Can I watch it?

1647
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,310
Can I watch it?

1648
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:42,750
Yeah.

1649
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:43,970
Yeah, of course.

1653
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:51,850

Guys, are you guys as rich as them?

1887
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:27,370
I thought we were going to your house.

1888
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,070
Wait, what?

1889
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:34,630
I thought he followed me.

1890
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:38,470
Wait, we can pick up the saddle.

1891
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:41,930
We can pick up the saddle at your place, and then go back.

1892
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:57,530
We can go back.

1893
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:03,150
We tried to follow him.

1894
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:07,280
We tried to follow him.

1895
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,940
Oh my god, everyone is so nice.

1896
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,260
Everyone is so nice.

1897
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,620
They are treating me so well.

1898
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:19,770
Wait.

1899
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:21,970
Wait, can he...

1900
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:23,370
No, wait.

1901
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:24,990
That can happen?

1902
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,710
That is what?

1903
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:46,030
Oh, they have to restart the server.

1904
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,000
It's okay.

1905
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,340
We can get a new dragoon.

1906
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,640
We'll get new dragoons, guys.

1907
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,160
It's fine.

1908
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:05,220
And pretend that we never lost you.

1909
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,180
You know, it's like how like... people would...

1910
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:10,000
Okay, it's so fucked up for me to say.

1911
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:11,700
But like... you know...

1912
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,120
There's like people that actually do that.

1913
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,000
Where they'll just buy the same pet.

1914
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:17,460
And then you just rename it.

1915
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,600
And then it's like they never died.

1916
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,180
So like some people have done that.

1917
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:21,900
Where they'll be like...

1918
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,120
My pet is like 80...

1919
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,000
It's like the oldest living pet in the world.

1920
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,700
Like 70 plus years old.

1921
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:31,980
But then like the mom would just secretly replace it every time.

1922
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,040
And just name it the same thing.

1923
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:38,080
So we're gonna do that.

1924
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,000
What?

1925
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,420
I don't get it.

1926
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:55,460
They cut the shot.

1927
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,240
Whoa.

1928
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:57,420
Are you the king?

1929
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:57,900
Yeah.

1930
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:58,380
What?

1931
01:11:58,460 --> 01:11:59,260
Don't say what.

1932
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:03,820
So this is not really our home.

1933
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:06,160
It's a temporary place.

1934
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:07,060
Oh.

1935
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,100
Don't say anything.

1936
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:09,040
It looks like shit.

1937
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:11,300
It looks...

1938
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,220
Look, our members are not here.

1939
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:15,620
It looks amazing.

1940
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:18,800
Dude, we're separated.

1941
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:20,400
It's not...

1942
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,360
Wait, this house?

1943
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,000
It's not...

1944
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,160
It's okay.

1945
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:24,600
So...

1946
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,020
What?

1947
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1948
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,040
It's over here.

1949
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:28,780
Oh.

1950
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,180
This is...

1951
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:30,620
You know what?

1952
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:35,480
It looks amazing.

1953
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:37,600
I love it.

1954
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:38,580
You're gonna open this?

1955
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:38,920
See?

1956
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,600
Wait, what is this?

1957
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:42,160
You're just...

1958
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,620
Oh, I'm too low.

1959
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:44,000
You're just...

1960
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,360
It's secure, bitch.

1961
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,940
Oh, yeah.

1962
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:47,360
I'm too...

1963
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:47,880
I'm too...

1964
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,520
I'm too low level.

1965
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:51,140
Look.

1966
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:51,660
Look.

1967
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:52,180
Come here.

1968
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:52,380
Come here.

1969
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:54,700
So, what about the story?

1970
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:55,480
Yeah?

1971
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:58,240
So this is where everybody starts, basically.

1972
01:12:58,780 --> 01:12:59,400
Uh-huh.

1973
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,800
So, Natchan just started.

1974
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,300
She's not really high level yet.

1975
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,460
And she took somebody else's house.

1976
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:07,940
This is actually somebody else made this.

1977
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,300
Woah!

1978
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:10,460
What the fuck?

1979
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:11,640
Oh yeah, this is somebody's...

1980
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,700
Personal owner, Kuru Kuru.

1981
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,580
This is beautiful.

1982
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:21,280
Wait, and then...

1983
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:25,120
Oh, she just put it in her... It was like somebody else's house.

1984
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:27,120
Wait, this is Natchan's house!

1985
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,880
It's very tiny because she just started.

1986
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:35,680
Wait, I should eat.

1987
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,260
Give me a sec, let me eat.

1988
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:40,540
I don't know if this is like, scared or... Take you somewhere else.

1989
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:41,100
Oh yeah.

1990
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:43,120
But like, basically, they stay here.

1991
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:44,900
My house is bigger than...

1992
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:46,720
It's like, it's like...

1993
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:51,040
...a cool, uh, here, like, area.

1994
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,460
Oh, this is your house?

1995
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,140
Yeah, I stay up here.

1996
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:55,780
This is where...

1997
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:58,080
...I have nothing here yet.

1998
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:58,480
Oh!

1999
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,240
What is this?

2000
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,060
Oh, it's a grill!

2001
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,260
Oh!

2002
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,520
You make food here.

2003
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,680
You can't have weapons, but... Yeah, this is a...

2004
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,700
Oh my god.

2005
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,740
One day I'll be just as rich.

2006
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:15,680
I thought I fell down.

2007
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:19,080
Oh, I'm here by the way.

2008
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,500
Oh my god.

2009
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,220
You can drink water, like, right here.

2010
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:27,320
Oh, wait, is this like, uh...

2011
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,440
...like a fountain?

2012
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:30,860
Yeah, I...

2013
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:35,710
Oh, I see.

2014
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:37,570
I'm learning so much.

2015
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:38,430
Like, specifically, I'll show you...

2016
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:40,350
...the...

2017
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:40,970
...VT?

2018
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:42,410
Yeah.

2019
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:45,850
Yeah, look, I've hidden all the pipes in.

2020
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:46,810
I should connect to the...

2021
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:49,210
Oh, yeah, so they... so it looks prettier.

2022
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:53,670
Yeah, it looks pretty ugly if you don't hide it.

2023
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,090
Oh, I see.

2024
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:58,450
And it's my breeding ground.

2025
01:14:58,690 --> 01:15:00,890
Your breeding ground?!

2026
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:02,210
Oh my god!

2027
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:03,590
Wait, what's this Santa thing?

2028
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:06,290
Oh, it's an event.

2029
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:07,910
What is it?

2030
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:08,890
It's a special event.

2031
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:12,430
He'll draw friends from the sky and you can open them.

2032
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:12,950
Oh!

2033
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:14,430
I see.

2034
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:19,990
And, uh, weapons and all that.

2035
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:20,450
And...

2036
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:22,970
Oh my god.

2037
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,220
What are you trying to breed?

2038
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,360
Oh, he is playing.

2039
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,080
Oh, you're gonna eat their babies?

2040
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:37,720
That's so weird.

2041
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:39,700
Oh, there's food right here.

2042
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,240
Oh no, that's poop.

2043
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:43,680
That's poop, nevermind.

2044
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:44,720
I thought that was...

2045
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,420
Oh, so you can eat the dodos.

2046
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,700
You can make the chicken.

2047
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:55,000
Ba dum bum, bum bum bum.

2048
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:56,940
Oh my god.

2049
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:04,280
Oh!

2050
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,300
I'm learning so much chat.

2051
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,600
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah.

2052
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:18,440
Yay!

2053
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:19,920
No, I'm okay.

2054
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:21,380
Just a little bit.

2055
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:23,720
A forbidden nugget.

2056
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:24,300
You know what?

2057
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,540
The reason why dodo birds are extinct is because apparently they're really delicious.

2058
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,140
That people just ate all of them.

2059
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,080
Ooh.

2060
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,340
Yeah, they're really stupid, but also delicious.

2061
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:46,540
Apparently.

2062
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:48,900
They're like... they're like grade A.

2063
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:52,820
Like, you know how there's like Kobe... Kobe beef and stuff like that?

2064
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:57,000
Like, it's basically like the chicken equivalent of like Kobe beef.

2065
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,340
I actually know they weren't...

2066
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,320
How do you know?

2067
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:06,180
You've never had a fucking dodo bird.

2068
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:09,700
Like, how would you know?

2069
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,620
They died before you were born.

2070
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:15,420
Kobe bird.

2071
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:21,280
You can't be like, they weren't that delicious.

2072
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:27,760
You literally weren't even born when they were tied up.

2073
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:28,960
How do I know?

2074
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,800
Because there were books about it!

2075
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:34,460
There were fucking books written about it!

2076
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:45,490
And they said that like dodo birds were delicious.

2077
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:50,690
Oh, oh my god.

2078
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:53,050
What the fuck is that?

2079
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:56,370
What is that?

2080
01:17:58,430 --> 01:17:59,590
Oh my god!

2081
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:01,790
Who... what is that?

2082
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:07,490
Oh my god!

2083
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:10,870
That's actually... wait, I feel like I might die from cold.

2084
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:12,770
I'm gonna freeze to death.

2085
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:13,590
Give me a sec.

2086
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:14,810
Let me... let me...

2087
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:17,470
I'm only wearing a bikini.

2088
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:24,090
Oh my god!

2089
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:25,090
Look at it!

2090
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:27,310
Holy shit!

2091
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:35,950
What the fuck is that?

2092
01:18:36,370 --> 01:18:38,030
What the fuck is that?

2093
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:41,490
Is it cute?

2094
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:42,290
What?

2095
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:43,670
I mean...

2096
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:45,850
I... no?

2097
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:49,170
No!

2098
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:50,470
Is this cute?

2099
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:50,770
No!

2100
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:52,370
How is this cute?

2101
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:52,850
This is pretty cute!

2102
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:58,790
It's... it's... it's so... it's so... it's so big and cute.

2103
01:18:58,870 --> 01:18:59,330
I don't know.

2104
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:00,470
It looks fluffy.

2105
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:04,690
What even is this?

2106
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:05,950
You can probably get this bag by...

2107
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:08,490
Oh my god.

2108
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:10,510
Dude, this guy owns so many bugs.

2109
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:12,350
This guy...

2110
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:13,990
Look at this.

2111
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:14,370
Look at this.

2112
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:14,830
Look at this.

2113
01:19:14,830 --> 01:19:14,970
Here.

2114
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:15,710
What is this?

2115
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:17,590
What the fuck?

2116
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:18,710
Is he sleeping in there?

2117
01:19:18,990 --> 01:19:19,470
What?

2118
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:21,570
He's in the kingpin.

2119
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:23,610
Oh my god.

2120
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:24,550
What the...

2121
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:27,710
They captured these people.

2122
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:28,710
Oh my god.

2123
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:30,370
He has prisoners?

2124
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:33,110
I don't wanna make him into...

2125
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:37,610
This person... this person that lives here is a crazy...

2126
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:38,550
He's crazy?

2127
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:56,650
He is... he is... he... sounds like... very... like... cute sounding.

2128
01:19:56,970 --> 01:19:58,270
But he's crazy.

2129
01:19:58,510 --> 01:19:59,510
He's crazy.

2130
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:01,810
I mean, he's keeping prisoners.

2131
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:03,350
Prisoners.

2132
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:03,710
Yeah.

2133
01:20:03,970 --> 01:20:07,030
I think he actually jailed... you know the girl that...

2134
01:20:07,030 --> 01:20:08,430
Hey, Lu Xiang.

2135
01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:11,150
Oh, your mic is cutting in and out again.

2136
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:13,750
Oh, can you hear me now?

2137
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:14,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2138
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:19,090
So, the girl earlier that was... Hey, Lu Xiang.

2139
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:20,930
The one that gave you the gorilla?

2140
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:21,550
Yeah.

2141
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:26,210
Like, pour it to... like... handcuffed her.

2142
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:26,810
So...

2143
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:28,890
The handcuffed her?

2144
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:30,210
Yeah.

2145
01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:33,450
He handcuffed her as well.

2146
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:35,750
Like, he's kinda crazy.

2147
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:37,130
Oh my god!

2148
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:37,850
Bro!

2149
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:40,410
Thank god he's not online right now.

2150
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:42,570
I think he's gonna... I think he might like...

2151
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:43,310
I think he is online.

2152
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:43,990
Oh, he is?

2153
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:44,790
Let me see.

2154
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:46,610
Oh my god.

2155
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:48,270
I don't want him to like... put me in jail.

2156
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:48,970
I'm scared.

2157
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:52,270
He has like actual prisoners.

2158
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:53,230
Yeah.

2159
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:54,290
Not sure.

2160
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:56,790
Not sure.

2161
01:20:58,170 --> 01:20:59,290
I'm scared.

2162
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:07,220
I'm scared.

2163
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:08,040
What the fuck?

2164
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:11,460
What happened to the fucking moose?

2165
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:16,750
How do they...

2166
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,190
He has like a baby creature.

2167
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:22,970
I gotta eat again.

2168
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:23,890
I'm hungry again.

2169
01:21:24,230 --> 01:21:25,490
I'm always hungry.

2170
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:29,430
Holy shit.

2171
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:32,050
Guys, I don't wanna go to jail.

2172
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:36,590
Guys, I'm scared.

2173
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:44,500
Oh my god.

2174
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:47,480
There's so many different kinds of animals though.

2175
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,800
Bro, this guy has like a fucking museum.

2176
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:53,840
He has a museum.

2177
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:56,860
Did I stole something?

2178
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:59,980
I don't... I don't even know if I did.

2179
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:01,660
Huh?

2180
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:02,640
What's going on?

2181
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,900
What does that mean?

2182
01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:08,330
Wait, Nachan is screaming.

2183
01:22:08,910 --> 01:22:09,650
Yeah, Nachan.

2184
01:22:09,710 --> 01:22:10,070
Are you okay?

2185
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:11,550
What's going on?

2186
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:14,830
What is that?

2187
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:16,470
Hello?

2188
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:28,600
My god.

2189
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:31,020
His dodo birds are so high level.

2190
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:35,920
No.

2191
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:47,560
This is... enemy birds by the way.

2192
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,360
Oh yeah.

2193
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,440
I was like wondering what that was.

2194
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:54,700
Sorry, the enemy.

2195
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:55,480
It's just...

2196
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:56,640
It's just dodo birds.

2197
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:57,040
Yeah.

2198
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:57,540
I think it's a vet.

2199
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,340
He's not the... He's not that guy, right?

2200
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:04,260
The prisoner guy?

2201
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,020
He's just here?

2202
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:05,280
No, no, no.

2203
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:06,400
This is Tsukikaze.

2204
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:07,020
Yeah.

2205
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:07,940
He typed.

2206
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,920
I don't think he has... He's using my account now.

2207
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:11,420
Oh, okay.

2208
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:11,800
Okay.

2209
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:13,520
I was like scared that it was him.

2210
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,800
But Coryx is on though.

2211
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,100
He is on?

2212
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:19,680
Okay.

2213
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:21,380
I think he's somewhere.

2214
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:22,560
He's somewhere.

2215
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,000
He's somewhere...

2216
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,240
I'm sorry.

2217
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:26,840
I think there is more people.

2218
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,800
The thing is he drops like... enemy...

2219
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:33,180
Wait.

2220
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:35,720
He drops stuff into your house?

2221
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:37,200
What?

2222
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,920
Oh my god.

2223
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:42,200
He's so scary.

2224
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,400
Do you think he'll be my friend?

2225
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,880
You think he'll be my friend?

2226
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:49,520
Yeah.

2227
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:49,900
He will.

2228
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:50,800
Hello.

2229
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:52,140
Hello.

2230
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:54,160
Wei, wait.

2231
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,060
We need to restart.

2232
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:59,660
But I don't know if they will restart.

2233
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:00,640
I don't dare to play again.

2234
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,320
There's like a bug?

2235
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:48,140
Oh, that's weird.

2236
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,340
That's weird.

2237
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:53,500
Oh my god, this guy actually has a fucking zoo.

2238
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,260
That's actually crazy.

2239
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:01,740
Alright, we might have to... we might have to...

2240
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:03,260
We're going to restart the server.

2241
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,820
It's been a nice tour though.

2242
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:07,340
I'm enjoying looking around the art server.

2243
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:09,360
I haven't learned much.

2244
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:14,440
I didn't really learn how to play.

2245
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:16,540
But like, I'm having a good time exploring.

2246
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:29,030
Oh, okay.

2247
01:25:29,170 --> 01:25:29,710
Yeah, yeah.

2248
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:40,090
It's been a fun tour.

2249
01:25:40,210 --> 01:25:42,030
I've been enjoying seeing everybody's houses.

2250
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:45,590
Because the server has been up for like a week, I think.

2251
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:51,780
Yay!

2252
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:56,360
And they let me see the gorilla.

2253
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:58,920
I get to join somebody's squad.

2254
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:02,480
Like, I get to join somebody's like OP fucking team.

2255
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:08,140
Woo!

2256
01:26:13,090 --> 01:26:16,230
Yeah, did all this in like... a week.

2257
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:16,630
Yeah.

2258
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,660
Wait, is King Kong... that...

2259
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:25,900
Is King Kong actually that insane to get?

2260
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:27,440
Oh my... guys...

2261
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:31,340
My first day and I already had a King Kong baby.

2262
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:33,860
But then I left, I disowned it.

2263
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,240
Because I'm not ready to be a parrot.

2264
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:46,460
Guys, I'm so good at vid... I'm so good at video games.

2265
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:49,100
On my first day, I got a King Kong.

2266
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,640
I get to ride a King Kong.

2267
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:54,660
You're fully groomed.

2268
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:56,340
Wait, Nachan.

2269
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,540
Wait, where did Nachan go?

2270
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:58,560
Nachan!

2271
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:01,740
Nachan!

2272
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:04,960
Nachan!

2273
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,360
I went to get milk.

2274
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:14,280
And left the... and left King Kong.

2275
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:17,500
Nachan!

2276
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,940
Wait, I think she's actually lost.

2277
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,180
Lost.

2278
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:28,960
Woah, did somebody build this?

2279
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:34,030
Wait, Hiro?

2280
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:34,970
Oh.

2281
01:27:35,310 --> 01:27:36,850
Oh, they restarted the server.

2282
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:38,510
Guys, I think the server got...

2283
01:27:38,510 --> 01:27:42,590
I don't know if... if Hiro DCs and I fucking fall...

2284
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:44,170
I swear to God.

2285
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:49,750
Oh, I hope it's a restart.

2286
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:55,790
Oh, no.

2287
01:27:56,630 --> 01:27:58,930
Oh, oh, oh.

2288
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,190
What's going on?

2289
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:01,010
Oh.

2290
01:28:01,890 --> 01:28:02,470
No!

2291
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:07,770
Oh,

2292
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:13,620
oh, oh.

2293
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:19,360
I love her, he's wild.

2294
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,140
Hey, he...

2295
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:23,400
Oh.

2296
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:34,840
I was so scared!

2297
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,600
I was so scared!

2298
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:40,120
No, I'm not dead!

2299
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:50,720
Holy shit!

2300
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:52,660
That was so scary!

2301
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,560
Oh my god!

2302
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,820
I was like, oh no!

2303
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,640
She's scaring me!

2304
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,540
I'm so fucked!

2305
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,980
I'm so fucked!

2306
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:05,280
No!

2307
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:05,860
No!

2308
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:06,960
If I don't...

2309
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:07,460
Guys!

2310
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:08,800
I can't die!

2311
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:09,520
If I...

2312
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:12,160
I can't die, guys!

2313
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:13,340
There's no way!

2314
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:13,880
Okay.

2315
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,020
Apparently the server is back up.

2316
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:16,520
Alright, join.

2317
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:18,580
Guys, it's okay.

2318
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:20,420
I left before I touched the ground.

2319
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,520
So technically, I'm still alive.

2320
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:23,740
Technically.

2321
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:28,780
It'll be okay.

2322
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:30,460
We're searching for...

2323
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:32,080
I'm searching for the session right now.

2324
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:33,700
Wait, where is it?

2325
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:34,960
Favorites...

2326
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,020
I can't find...

2327
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:39,280
The server is still not up yet.

2328
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,520
It says people are...

2329
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:42,000
You know what?

2330
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:42,940
I can enter now.

2331
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:45,600
Until you hit the ground.

2332
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:46,940
If I never...

2333
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:50,400
If I never get back on, I'll still be alive.

2334
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:55,140
Oh, they're...

2335
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:55,700
Not yet?

2336
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:57,620
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick then.

2337
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:58,520
I'll be right back, guys.

2338
01:29:58,740 --> 01:29:59,700
I'll be right back.

2339
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:04,920
I'm back.

2340
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,340
Apparently at the...

2341
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:07,180
Let me see refresh.

2342
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,080
Someone said to re-add the server because they restarted it.

2343
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:13,160
Alright, let me re-add the server.

2344
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:14,260
Okay.

2345
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:15,460
Let me find it again.

2346
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:16,340
Give me a sec.

2347
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:17,480
I'm learning.

2348
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:19,880
I'm having fun though.

2349
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,680
Everybody is so friendly.

2350
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:22,360
I like that.

2351
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:26,300
I like it when people are nice.

2352
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:29,520
Oh, it needs 10 minutes.

2353
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:30,100
Never mind.

2354
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:33,900
We still need 10 more minutes.

2355
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:35,620
To restart the server.

2356
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:38,500
So, we'll just chill a little bit.

2357
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:39,380
But...

2358
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:41,460
It's pretty chill.

2359
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:43,760
I really want to meet the criminal.

2360
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:45,360
The crazy guy.

2361
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:46,700
Really?

2362
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:51,420
I gave it back.

2363
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,340
I didn't realize I took the egg.

2364
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:55,580
I was so used to just pressing E on stuff.

2365
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:57,500
But I dropped the egg.

2366
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:59,600
I dropped the egg before...

2367
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:01,380
Before...

2368
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,060
Before I kept it.

2369
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:05,920
But...

2370
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,780
I want to meet the crazy guy.

2371
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:09,720
That's been locking people up.

2372
01:32:09,980 --> 01:32:12,500
I know that Kiro's mic has been really fucking weird.

2373
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:15,220
Because she was telling us how her PC is sort of low-key dying.

2374
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:16,380
And...

2375
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:19,220
She was saying how... I don't know if you guys heard it.

2376
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:19,860
But she was saying how...

2377
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,340
People were like...

2378
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:23,480
The crazy guy...

2379
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:26,580
Was dropping enemies into other people's homes.

2380
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,200
Just to fuck with them.

2381
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:29,020
And I was like...

2382
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:30,180
Man, I'm a troll.

2383
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:32,580
But that is like... at a next level.

2384
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:37,040
I was just like...

2385
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:38,040
I was just like...

2386
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:38,980
Oh my god.

2387
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,620
That is next level.

2388
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:42,520
I'm fucked up.

2389
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:49,920
They actually dropped enemies onto other people's homes.

2390
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:50,720
I was like...

2391
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:51,640
Oh my god.

2392
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,240
No wonder Kiro was like...

2393
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:55,300
Yeah, he's crazy.

2394
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,380
I wanted him.

2395
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:03,220
He had like a cages of three different people.

2396
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:09,580
He had like...

2397
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:11,880
Cages of three fucking people.

2398
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:13,020
Just sleeping there.

2399
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,600
Next to like...

2400
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:17,440
Apparently he's on the server.

2401
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,880
And Kiro was saying like...

2402
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:19,940
Yeah, he's doing something.

2403
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:21,360
So I was just like...

2404
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,260
What is he?

2405
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:25,960
He's a little scary.

2406
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:27,380
I'm not gonna lie.

2407
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:32,540
They are the people...

2408
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:34,340
No, he did that to Kiro's house.

2409
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,420
He did that to Kiro's house.

2410
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:37,540
That's why I was like...

2411
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:38,380
Oh my god.

2412
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:40,380
That's a whole next level.

2413
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:42,420
What is he cooking?

2414
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,060
And he was saying how...

2415
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:46,300
He was saying like...

2416
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:48,280
Several people.

2417
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:49,480
Did you hear that?

2418
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,660
He handcuffed several...

2419
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:56,320
He handcuffed the girl that gave me a gorilla.

2420
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:57,660
Gave me King Kong.

2421
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,580
Why did he do it though?

2422
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,640
Because he's a fucking troll.

2423
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:03,180
Because he's crazy.

2424
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:04,160
Apparently.

2425
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:07,220
But yes, I've been enjoying.

2426
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,640
I can't believe the first thing Kiro...

2427
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:11,800
One of the first things Kiro gave me...

2428
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,120
Was water and a bikini.

2429
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:15,320
And then at that point I knew my place.

2430
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:16,480
Hahaha.

2431
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:20,980
Look I died seven times.

2432
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:21,300
Guys.

2433
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,080
I fucking died.

2434
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:24,460
Seven times.

2435
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:26,540
To a god damn insect.

2436
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:28,700
I need this.

2437
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:31,100
I need someone to take care of me.

2438
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,220
Hahaha.

2439
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:33,740
Hahaha.

2440
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:35,200
Hahaha.

2441
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:40,600
Because I got...

2442
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,760
I died to that fucking mosquito.

2443
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:45,220
Seven different times.

2444
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:46,340
Hahaha.

2445
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:49,680
And I never got my revenge.

2446
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:51,780
Hahaha.

2447
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:53,780
Hahaha.

2448
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:54,220
Hahaha.

2449
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:56,940
Every single time.

2450
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:57,720
Hahaha.

2451
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:00,900
It's okay.

2452
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:02,140
It's alright.

2453
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:03,040
Guys.

2454
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,080
People are so nice though.

2455
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:05,840
That girl that...

2456
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:09,460
The one with all the animals.

2457
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:12,540
And she let me join their tribe for like...

2458
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:13,380
Five minutes.

2459
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:16,000
So I would know what it feels like to be rich in Ark.

2460
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:16,860
Like...

2461
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:17,320
Hahaha.

2462
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:18,900
Hahaha.

2463
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:24,620
I get to feel the wealth in Ark for like...

2464
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:25,820
Five, ten minutes.

2465
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:26,860
That was nice.

2466
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:28,280
Hahaha.

2467
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:29,900
Hahaha.

2468
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:32,940
And then she was gonna like...

2469
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:34,540
She wanted to give me that gorilla.

2470
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:35,720
And I felt bad.

2471
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:37,120
Cause I was like no it's okay.

2472
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:39,300
Let me just like go for milk.

2473
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:40,540
Like go out like...

2474
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:42,100
No, no.

2475
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:43,780
You don't need to give me the gorilla.

2476
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:44,580
It's okay.

2477
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:47,160
Let me go out and you know...

2478
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:48,360
Go out and get some milk.

2479
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,360
Her base...

2480
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:51,440
Her base was not ugly.

2481
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:53,520
I've seen an ugly base.

2482
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:54,820
But not Hiro's base.

2483
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:57,100
Hiro's base was very pretty.

2484
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:58,120
Hahaha.

2485
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:01,940
She gave me...

2486
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:03,880
She gave me prehistoric Mercedes.

2487
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:05,020
Yeah.

2488
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:08,720
She gave me prehistoric Mercedes.

2489
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:09,500
She gave me prehistoric Mercedes.

2490
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:10,960
And I was like...

2491
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:11,620
Oh my god.

2492
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:12,940
Hahaha.

2493
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:18,740
Uh...

2494
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:19,920
It was insane.

2495
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,460
But then I felt like...

2496
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:22,680
You know I was just like...

2497
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:23,860
I don't know man.

2498
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:25,000
Guys I...

2499
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,180
Hahaha.

2500
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:32,320
Alright.

2501
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:33,040
Let's see.

2502
01:36:36,180 --> 01:36:36,580
Uh...

2503
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:38,500
Sorry.

2504
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,540
We're waiting for the servers.

2505
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:41,520
I think after I see the house...

2506
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,160
I'm gonna try to tame another dragoon.

2507
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:45,040
Wait no.

2508
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:46,640
I'm gonna tame my first dragoon.

2509
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:48,300
Because I never tamed a creature yet.

2510
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:49,800
So uh...

2511
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:51,320
I never tamed a creature yet.

2512
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:53,120
So I wanna test it.

2513
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:53,720
Try it out.

2514
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:55,260
And then see...

2515
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:57,860
And then we'll call it there.

2516
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:00,120
Hahaha.

2517
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:01,260
Hahaha.

2518
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:04,420
Yeah the server is still not up.

2519
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,280
I'll be like okay.

2520
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:07,700
Let me know when it's...

2521
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:08,360
Let me know.

2522
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:12,780
I'm just chatting with my...

2523
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:14,440
With my dragoons.

2524
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:18,580
Start with a dota or something easy?

2525
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:19,000
No!

2526
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,880
I wanna pterodactyl.

2527
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:23,460
I wanna pterodactyl.

2528
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:24,820
And call it a dragoon.

2529
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:26,280
I've never tried it before.

2530
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:27,880
Uh...

2531
01:37:28,860 --> 01:37:30,780
They said like 10 minutes.

2532
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:32,940
Uh...

2533
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:34,700
Do not believe her lies.

2534
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:35,900
What am I lying about?

2535
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,560
I've never tamed anything in this game before.

2536
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:41,720
I've never tamed anything.

2537
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:42,680
I've never tamed anything.

2538
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:44,340
Aphelion thank you for the 10 gift of ships.

2539
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:44,800
Thank you.

2540
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:46,600
No it's pterodactyl.

2541
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,760
It's pterodactyl.

2542
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:50,260
It's pterodactyl.

2543
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:51,860
How would you know?

2544
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:53,280
They don't even...

2545
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:56,680
They're gonna fucking come back from extinction.

2546
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:58,540
To tell you what they're actually called.

2547
01:37:59,120 --> 01:37:59,600
Like...

2548
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:00,060
Hahaha.

2549
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:01,800
Hahaha.

2550
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:05,500
You're dead!

2551
01:38:05,860 --> 01:38:07,880
They can't tell you what they're actually called.

2552
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:09,620
The P is silent.

2553
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:10,840
No it's pterodactyl.

2554
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:12,260
Guys.

2555
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:13,940
It's always been pterodactyl.

2556
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:15,540
It's like dodo birds.

2557
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:18,040
You don't know what the fuck they taste like.

2558
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:19,080
They...

2559
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:21,020
Historical records...

2560
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:23,460
Oh yeah someone tried to actually eat me.

2561
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:24,960
Uh garlic thank you for the super chat.

2562
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:28,280
Historical records indicate that they didn't taste very good.

2563
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:31,640
But they were eaten to extinction because it was the only meat around for miles.

2564
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:34,500
Like they would park boats on the island to eat them.

2565
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:35,000
Like they would park boats on the island to eat them.

2566
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:35,420
Wait what?

2567
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,100
They would park boats?

2568
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:38,880
There's like other... there's fish.

2569
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:39,880
Fish?

2570
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:46,060
What were fish then?

2571
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:48,420
Like what were fish?

2572
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:49,820
Hahaha.

2573
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:52,840
No they described it as tough but good.

2574
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:57,380
And like some hunted dodos only for the gizzards.

2575
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:59,920
Because the most delicious part of the bird.

2576
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:02,060
Yeah see I told you.

2577
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:04,280
You can't actually meet.

2578
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:06,560
Wikipedia which is the best source of information.

2579
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:08,060
It's like a list of uh...

2580
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:11,520
Yeah see there's always people saying dodos must have tasted...

2581
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:12,160
Uh...

2582
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:14,100
See like okay some people say...

2583
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:15,200
Look it's like preferences.

2584
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:18,000
Some are like oh it wasn't that great.

2585
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,000
But then others are saying that...

2586
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,580
Um they were good.

2587
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:22,820
Hahaha.

2588
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,100
Hahaha.

2589
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:28,320
Let's see.

2590
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:29,460
How big were dodos?

2591
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:30,840
They were like 40 pounds?

2592
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:32,880
Oh my god they were like bigger than turkeys.

2593
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:35,400
Dodos were modern animals.

2594
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:37,700
Mid 17th century.

2595
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:39,040
Taking straight.

2596
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:42,100
Blue parrots are very numerous as well as other birds.

2597
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:43,500
Their birds lacked wings.

2598
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:44,280
Blah blah blah.

2599
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:49,240
Nevertheless their belly and breasts were of a pleasant flavor.

2600
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:50,380
See?

2601
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:51,940
Look at that.

2602
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:52,440
Okay.

2603
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:57,680
Nevertheless their belly and breasts were of a pleasant flavor.

2604
01:39:58,560 --> 01:39:59,400
There you go.

2605
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:02,980
There you go guys.

2606
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:04,200
I told you guys.

2607
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:05,180
It's all about preferences.

2608
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:07,140
Some people don't like beef.

2609
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:08,220
There.

2610
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:09,800
Some people don't like beef.

2611
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,020
But then yet they still eat it.

2612
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:16,640
So others will eat anything that isn't hard tacked.

2613
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:17,220
That's true.

2614
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:17,960
That's so true.

2615
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,200
Stream tack education.

2616
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:23,940
To be fair.

2617
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:24,660
I hate turkey.

2618
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:27,580
I don't understand why people like to eat turkey.

2619
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:30,620
Because I find turkey to be like very dry.

2620
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:31,980
And uh.

2621
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:34,320
Not like flavorless.

2622
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,880
You have to put like fucking gravy or something.

2623
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:38,660
To make it taste like gravy.

2624
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:40,340
You need to put actual like gravy.

2625
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:42,320
And like cranberries.

2626
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,160
To actually make it like taste like something.

2627
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:49,640
But like I feel like turkey is very dry.

2628
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:50,720
But like I feel like turkey is very dry.

2629
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:50,960
Not dry.

2630
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:54,100
I mean turkey is very flavorless in general.

2631
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:55,320
I mean turkey is very flavorless in general.

2632
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:55,900
Yeah.

2633
01:40:56,020 --> 01:40:57,760
I think like turkey is inferior chicken.

2634
01:40:58,040 --> 01:40:58,900
It truly is.

2635
01:40:59,020 --> 01:40:59,940
I mean they're stupid.

2636
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:00,980
I mean to be fair.

2637
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,280
Chicken is like.

2638
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:03,120
Like.

2639
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:04,640
Just that stupid.

2640
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:06,020
But turkey is like.

2641
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:10,640
It's like turkeys we domesticated them so hard.

2642
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:11,780
That like.

2643
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:17,000
Like have you seen like the size of a turkey brain?

2644
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:18,560
Size of.

2645
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:21,900

2647
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:23,900
Yeah.

2648
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:24,800
It's like a pea.

2649
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:27,160
That's like how tiny it is.

2650
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:29,480
It's like the size of a fucking pea.

2651
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:29,920
It's like the size of a fucking pea.

2652
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:31,540
That's so tiny.

2653
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:33,100
Yeah.

2654
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:33,720
It's pea size.

2655
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:34,940
Wow.

2656
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:35,420
Turkeys.

2657
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:35,720
Yeah.

2658
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:36,960
But like I'm talking about like.

2659
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:38,420
It's the same thing.

2660
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:39,320
Like of course.

2661
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:41,320
Domesticated turkeys are.

2662
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,260
Are really stupid because.

2663
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,220
You know they've been bred to.

2664
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:47,940
How stupid are domesticated.

2665
01:41:50,420 --> 01:41:50,900
Domesticated.

2666
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:51,560
Domesticated.

2667
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:53,180
Turkeys.

2668
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:55,140
Sorry I had like a little brain fart.

2669
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:57,020

2670
01:41:57,540 --> 01:41:58,020

2672
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:03,840
Okay.

2673
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:08,300
Alright wild turkeys are very intelligent animals.

2674
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:09,280
What the fuck do we do?

2675
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:10,680
Hahahaha.

2676
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:13,040

Wait.

2679
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:17,520
Apparently.

2680
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:19,320
They used to be highly intelligent animals.

2681
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:21,280
What the fuck do we do to the turkey?

2682
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:22,840
Oh my god.

2683
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:23,980

01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:28,560
Hahahaha.

2686
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:29,680
Oh my god.

2687
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:34,140
They used to be smart.

2688
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:35,200
Oh my god it's like me.

2689
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:36,420
I used to be smart.

2690
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:37,380
And then I started streaming.

2691
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:38,940
I used to have.

2692
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:41,500
Like I used to have a professor that like.

2693
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:44,460

2694
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:45,280
And then.

2695
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:46,760
I don't know what happened.

2696
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:47,760
I just started streaming.

2697
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:49,060
Hahahaha.

2698
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,720
I did higher education.

2699
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,140
We bred them harder than.

2700
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:57,960
Art players ever could.

2701
01:42:58,940 --> 01:42:59,420
Hahahaha.

2702
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:00,400
Hahahaha.

2703
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:03,620
Alright.

2704
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:04,700
Oh.

2705
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:10,600
Alright.

2706
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:11,520
We're just waiting.

2707
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:12,100

2710
01:43:21,190 --> 01:43:22,430
Boop boop boop.

2711
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:23,410

We're just waiting.

2714
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:32,440
The day Doki's brain shrunk three sizes.

2715
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:33,980
So true.

2716
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:35,360
Hahahaha.

2717
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:36,580
Hahahaha.

2718
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:39,860
Woah.

2719
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:40,600
Sorry.

2720
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:42,640
I don't know if my chrome.

2721
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:43,620
Wait is my chrome.

2722
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:45,100
Oh good my chrome is not on.

2723
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:46,600
Okay thank god you guys didn't hear it.

2724
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:47,320
Hahahaha.

2725
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:52,420
Let me refresh and see if the server is back up.

2726
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:54,020
I know I did say like I told.

2727
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:55,360
Hero to let me know.

2728
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:57,420
But the server is still not back up.

2729
01:43:57,620 --> 01:44:00,580
Yeah so the reason why they had to restart the server.

2730
01:44:00,940 --> 01:44:01,900
Is because apparently.

2731
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:04,840
Somebody did something that bugged the whole server.

2732
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:06,620
So they're trying to figure out.

2733
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:08,060
They couldn't figure out what.

2734
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:09,860
Who did it.

2735
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:10,840
I guess.

2736
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:13,080
I guess they couldn't figure out who.

2737
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,320
It wasn't me.

2738
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:17,720
Because it was happening before I was there guys.

2739
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:19,300
It wasn't me.

2740
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,280
It was happening before.

2741
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:23,020
Me out joined.

2742
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,780
So what did I do.

2743
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,680
I literally all I did was I died.

2744
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:29,220
Three times to gravity.

2745
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:32,220
And then like three times to a fucking mosquito.

2746
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:33,960
Like what did I do.

2747
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:35,120
Hahahaha.

2748
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:36,880
What did I do.

2749
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:38,900
Hahahaha.

2750
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:41,780
Anyway.

2751
01:44:42,340 --> 01:44:42,880
Um.

2752
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:46,060
So they're saying that somebody.

2753
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:47,380
Bugged.

2754
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:48,780
Bugged the server.

2755
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:51,120
And then they've been trying to figure out.

2756
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:53,240
What it was but they couldn't.

2757
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:54,700
So that's why they're resetting the server.

2758
01:44:55,540 --> 01:44:57,560
So we're still waiting for it.

2759
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:01,980
Bum.

2760
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:03,020
Bum.

2761
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:12,660
We're just waiting.

2762
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:15,140
Ah I think like.

2763
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:16,120
After the tour.

2764
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,060
After the tour.

2765
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:18,620
And we.

2766
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:19,860
I know I said it before.

2767
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:20,980
But after the tour.

2768
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:24,060
And domesticating a dragoon.

2769
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:25,260
We're gonna call it here.

2770
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:27,060
Cause I'm getting a little eepy.

2771
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:30,080
Just getting a little eepy right now.

2772
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:40,660
Yeah.

2773
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:42,240
It's really late.

2774
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:43,720
Um.

2775
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:46,420
I might push the sunland stream.

2776
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:47,600
Um.

2777
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:48,500
A bit later.

2778
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:49,320
Uh.

2779
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:50,360
Just cause like.

2780
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:54,020
We're having like fire alarms being checked.

2781
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:55,260
In my apartment.

2782
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:56,480
So like.

2783
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:58,240
I'm gonna see if like.

2784
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,740
I'm gonna see if fire alarms will be checked.

2785
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:03,560
Before my stream.

2786
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,880
And then if.

2787
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:10,460
If the fire alarm people doesn't come to check it.

2788
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:12,220
Then I might stream.

2789
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:12,940
A little.

2790
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:14,580
I might push the stream back until.

2791
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:15,840
Uh.

2792
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,000
Until like.

2793
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:21,000
They check it.

2794
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:22,900
Cause they have to come into my PC room.

2795
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:24,580
I think it's a little awkward.

2796
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:25,420
You know.

2797
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:28,440
It's like the xQc thing.

2798
01:46:28,620 --> 01:46:30,020
Where I don't know if you guys have seen the.

2799
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:32,440
One of the infamous xQc clips.

2800
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:33,660
Where uh.

2801
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:35,500
He was you know streaming.

2802
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,380
And then the maids came in.

2803
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:40,040
Like his maids came in.

2804
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:41,600
And was just like judging him.

2805
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:43,400
Like I don't wanna be judged.

2806
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:52,240
I don't wanna be.

2807
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:53,800

Oh it's on now.

2828
01:47:37,130 --> 01:47:37,650
Okay.

2829
01:47:38,510 --> 01:47:40,510
Alright they have to back up the server.

2830
01:47:40,790 --> 01:47:42,290
But anyway this is the xQc video.

2831
01:47:42,350 --> 01:47:43,050
I was talking about.

2832
01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:45,930
And that is like one of the reasons why I'm thinking about starting.

2833
01:47:46,110 --> 01:47:47,030
The stream later.

2834
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:47,870
Because I'm scared.

2835
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:52,690
I don't.

2836
01:47:52,690 --> 01:47:54,690
I don't wanna be judged.

2837
01:47:55,090 --> 01:47:55,730
I'm kidding.

2838
01:47:58,910 --> 01:48:00,650
Alright let's see.

2839
01:48:01,610 --> 01:48:02,570
Alright let's see.

2840
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:03,150
Alright let's see.

01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:05,110
xQc has maids.

2842
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:06,710
xQc is a fucking millionaire.

2843
01:48:07,210 --> 01:48:10,130
You know like those gambling sponsors he takes.

2844
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:10,550
You know like those gambling sponsors he takes.

2845
01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:12,550
Like from that alone.

2846
01:48:12,650 --> 01:48:14,770
You can get like a million plus.

2847
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:15,590
Like.

2848
01:48:18,790 --> 01:48:20,230

01:48:22,070 --> 01:48:24,150
Of course he has maids.

2851
01:48:24,590 --> 01:48:25,030

2852
01:48:27,370 --> 01:48:27,810
Alright.

2853
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:28,890
We're loading in.

2854
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:32,790
He can afford it.

2855
01:48:32,830 --> 01:48:34,930
He gets like 50k viewers every stream.

2856
01:48:49,150 --> 01:48:50,590
She was reading what he wrote.

2857
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:51,590
I mean yeah.

01:48:53,870 --> 01:48:54,810
That's gonna mean like.

2859
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:56,290
What the fire alarm guy is gonna think.

2860
01:48:56,310 --> 01:48:57,030
When I start streaming.

2861
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:02,550
Gambling is too lucratif.

2862
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:03,270
It's not even a leak.

2863
01:49:03,370 --> 01:49:04,110
It's common knowledge.

2864
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:06,070
Why else would they like.

2865
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:07,790
Fucking take those sponsors.

2866
01:49:08,230 --> 01:49:09,210
And like willing to.

2867
01:49:09,370 --> 01:49:10,510
Oh my god I'm alive.

2868
01:49:11,130 --> 01:49:13,010
You guys thought I would die.

2869
01:49:15,410 --> 01:49:15,890
Alright.

2870
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:16,990

2871
01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:18,150
Wait I'm naked.

2872
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:19,470
No I was supposed to be naked.

2873
01:49:19,470 --> 01:49:19,710
I'm naked.

2874
01:49:20,530 --> 01:49:21,010
Okay.

2875
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:25,920
You guys said I would die!

2876
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:26,640
Look at me!

01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:34,280
Where is my carry?

2881
01:49:35,780 --> 01:49:36,560
Oh no.

2882
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:38,580
Oh no.

2883
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:42,320
Oh wait, I have a Parasaur saddle?

2884
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:44,420
How the fuck did I get all these things?

2885
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:46,860
Okay, let me eat though.

2886
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,220
I'm like so hungry.

2887
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:52,080
Okay, where is...

01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:56,260
Oh, okay, they're still loading in.

2889
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:58,120
We can explore a little bit.

2890
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:01,240
They're apparently...

2891
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:04,680
They're apparently loading in.

2892
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:05,860
Guys...

2893
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:08,500
How do I explore?

2894
01:50:10,620 --> 01:50:12,400
Oh guys, you wanna see how strong I am?

2895
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:13,100
Look at this.

2896
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,300
That's how strong I am, guys.

2897
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:20,080
88 wood.

2898
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:21,920
Off the bat.

2899
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:22,960
Alright.

2900
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:25,300
Okay, let's like level up some stuff.

2901
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:34,760
Okay, apparently we want movement speed, and then we want stamina, HP, stamina, weight, melee, weight, health.

2902
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:35,920
Okay, there you go.

2903
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:37,080
That should be fine.

2904
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:38,200
So how do I craft?

2905
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:39,600
Oh, see?

2906
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:40,200
They're online.

2907
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:41,820
That's me.

2908
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:43,380
I'm real female doki.

2909
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:45,160
I'm right over here.

2910
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:46,580
Oh, Ditto's...

2911
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:47,660
Oh yeah, Ditto's in here too.

2912
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:48,920
Wait, what the fuck?

2913
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:50,400
Why am I not an admin?

2914
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:51,700
God!

2915
01:50:54,220 --> 01:50:55,240
What the fuck?

2916
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:58,020
How come Ditto is an admin and I'm not?

2917
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:03,900
Wait a minute.

2918
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,080
Wait, is that mine?

2919
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:07,540
Taming...

2920
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:10,600
Defectiveness... wild.

2921
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:11,800
Wait, what does that mean?

2922
01:51:15,350 --> 01:51:16,210
Let's see.

2923
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:19,410
I wonder where did my...

2924
01:51:19,410 --> 01:51:21,890
Wait, what is that?

2925
01:51:24,230 --> 01:51:25,390
Is this a...

2926
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:27,490
What is this?

2927
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:37,720
What is this?

2928
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:39,860
What is this?

2929
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:39,960
What that...

2930
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:40,420
What is that?

2931
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:44,500
Guys, what the fuck is this?

2932
01:51:46,940 --> 01:51:47,980
It says...

2933
01:51:47,980 --> 01:51:49,960
My taming list, but I don't know.

2934
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:52,260
Wait, I... I knocked down?

2935
01:51:52,620 --> 01:51:54,440
Who did... Who the fuck is this?

2936
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:55,860
This is not the dragoon.

2937
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:58,040
Because I never tamed a dragoon.

2938
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:04,340
Oh, someone is taming a creature right now.

2939
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:05,340
Oh, it's not me.

2940
01:52:05,580 --> 01:52:05,900
Okay.

2941
01:52:06,940 --> 01:52:09,620
Oh, someone in my tribe is taming it.

2942
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:11,400
Oh, I see.

2943
01:52:13,820 --> 01:52:14,940
I see.

2944
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:15,940
I see.

2945
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:16,140
Okay.

2946
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:18,640
How do they know where I am?

2947
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:21,280
Hello!

2948
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:23,700
Kero!

2949
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:26,560
Nachan!

2950
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:29,320
Hello!

2951
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:29,760
Hello!

2952
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:36,160
Somebody save me!

2953
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:44,040
Somebody save me!

2954
01:52:44,780 --> 01:52:44,860
Somebody save me!

2955
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:45,340
Oh, hey, crafting.

2956
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:47,080
Can I craft a gun now?

2957
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:48,860
Craft one.

2958
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:51,240
Do I have a gun?

2959
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:53,840
Where is it?

2960
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:56,600
Oh my god, guys.

2961
01:52:57,580 --> 01:52:58,920
Oh my god, guys.

2962
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:07,000
What the fuck is this?

2963
01:53:07,340 --> 01:53:08,900
Oh, it's a toy!

2964
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:10,880
Oh!

2965
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,260
Okay, it looks like a gun.

2966
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:17,840
I'm lost.

2967
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:23,240
Wait, I'm next to...

2968
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:26,140
Next to building...

2969
01:53:26,140 --> 01:53:27,800
Next to...

2970
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:28,140
Castle.

2971
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:28,560
Castle.

2972
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:30,300
I'm in a hole.

2973
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:35,880
Okay, I'm in the hole.

2974
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:37,960
Is that pickaxe?

2975
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:39,360
Hold and reload.

2976
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:40,860
Multi-tool.

2977
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:42,220
But it looks like a gun!

2978
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:44,440
Look at it!

2979
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:49,320
Oh, it's a mod.

2980
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:52,340
Please don't hurt me.

2981
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:53,520
Please don't hurt me.

2982
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:54,560
Hello!

2983
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:56,640
Oh god, oh no.

2984
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:57,640
Hello!

2985
01:54:05,020 --> 01:54:06,060
I'm just...

2986
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:07,400
Leave me alone!

2987
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:08,360
Ah!

2988
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:12,900
Help!

2989
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:14,700
There's a bird chasing me!

2990
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:17,460
Oh no.

2991
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:18,540
Oh no.

2992
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:19,360
Oh no.

2993
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:22,340
Are they... they're not friend-shaped?

2994
01:54:24,140 --> 01:54:25,180
Keep moving.

2995
01:54:25,540 --> 01:54:27,880
Bird vs... Okay, this guy seems nice.

2996
01:54:28,860 --> 01:54:29,580
You're hot.

2997
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:31,060
You should find some place to cool down.

2998
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:32,660
I'm literally wearing a bikini.

2999
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:34,180
What the fuck do you want from me?

3000
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:35,060
I have the high ground.

3001
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:38,440
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

3002
01:54:38,440 --> 01:54:39,600
Okay, what does my map say?

3003
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:41,920
I don't know what that means.

3004
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:45,180
80 of 40.

3005
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:45,820
Okay.

3006
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:46,580
Is that...

3007
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:48,660
Look, I even cocked a gun!

3008
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:54,800
I'm sad.

3009
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,480
I created something useless.

3010
01:54:58,740 --> 01:55:01,000
That seems like something I do.

3011
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:06,340
Oh!

3012
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:07,020
Hello!

3013
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:09,620
Yeah!

3014
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:10,580
It's me!

3015
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:12,740
I'm here!

3016
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:15,120
I'm here!

3017
01:55:16,420 --> 01:55:17,840
I was so scared.

3018
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:20,800
I was so scared, Hiro.

3019
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:21,320
I was so scared, Hiro.

3020
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:23,380
A bird tried to kill me.

3021
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,620
Yeah, my Hiro!

3022
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:32,760
My Hiro!

3023
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:34,620
I thought you were trying to go here.

3024
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:35,940
Yeah!

3025
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:37,100
Oh, here it is!

3026
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:38,460
Wait, did you guys build this?

3027
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:40,460
No!

3028
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:41,760
Wait, did...

3029
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:42,880
This is the crazy guy!

3030
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:45,660
This is the crazy guy?!

3031
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,080
Wait, is he online?

3032
01:55:48,380 --> 01:55:49,080
Is he okay?

3033
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:50,520
I don't know.

3034
01:55:50,540 --> 01:55:51,520
I think he's loading it.

3035
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:52,920
Wait, if we kill...

3036
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:55,120
We should make a cage on him!

3037
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:57,800
Put a cage around him before he can go crazy.

3038
01:55:57,900 --> 01:55:58,140
Oh!

3039
01:55:58,140 --> 01:55:58,200
Oh!

3040
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:02,480
Oh, you have a beautiful home, sir.

3041
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:04,060
You have...

3042
01:56:04,060 --> 01:56:05,240
Hello!

3043
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:05,860
Hello!

3044
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:09,720
Hiro!

3045
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:10,740
Do you speak Cantonese?

3046
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:12,220
I'm Cantonese.

3047
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:13,540
Oh, you're Cantonese?

3048
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:14,300
Yes,

3049
01:56:18,410 --> 01:56:19,650
I can understand.

3050
01:56:21,050 --> 01:56:22,310
Oh my god!

3051
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:24,730
I can actually understand!

3052
01:56:27,130 --> 01:56:28,290
Oh my god!

3053
01:56:29,110 --> 01:56:30,970
Is he a Hiro?

3054
01:56:31,430 --> 01:56:32,810
Are you a crazy person?

3055
01:56:32,990 --> 01:56:33,550
He told me.

3056
01:56:34,150 --> 01:56:35,230
Am I crazy?

3057
01:56:35,810 --> 01:56:39,070
Yes, he said you're a crazy person.

3058
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:39,970
Hahaha!

3059
01:56:40,430 --> 01:56:41,310
No, you...

3060
01:56:41,310 --> 01:56:43,010
You said I'm crazy.

3061
01:56:43,790 --> 01:56:44,890
You're crazy!

3062
01:56:45,410 --> 01:56:47,390
You're crazy!

3063
01:56:47,810 --> 01:56:49,150
You're crazy!

3064
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:50,950
You're crazy!

3065
01:56:55,450 --> 01:56:56,610
He is...

3066
01:56:57,130 --> 01:56:58,290
He's crazy!

3067
01:56:58,510 --> 01:57:01,310
He's been cheating me so many times.

3068
01:57:01,430 --> 01:57:02,030
Hahaha!

3069
01:57:02,430 --> 01:57:03,890
You've been cheating me so many times.

3070
01:57:04,510 --> 01:57:04,870
Hahaha!

3071
01:57:05,910 --> 01:57:07,870
He's been cheating you so many times.

3072
01:57:08,170 --> 01:57:10,430
Why is there a person in your house?

3073
01:57:10,450 --> 01:57:12,070
Why are you catching people?

3074
01:57:13,690 --> 01:57:16,390
You have three people.

3075
01:57:16,530 --> 01:57:17,290
Why did you catch three people?

3076
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:18,130
You...

3077
01:57:19,090 --> 01:57:19,910
What are you doing?

3078
01:57:22,210 --> 01:57:22,930
This...

3079
01:57:22,930 --> 01:57:23,230
He's better.

3080
01:57:23,890 --> 01:57:24,610
Hahaha!

3081
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:26,010
Hahaha!

3082
01:57:31,430 --> 01:57:31,690
You're so awesome.

3083
01:57:31,890 --> 01:57:32,410
He's a...

3084
01:57:34,330 --> 01:57:35,650
Hello, hello.

3085
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:37,190
Hello!

3086
01:57:39,170 --> 01:57:40,790
Hello, nice to meet you.

3087
01:57:41,350 --> 01:57:42,950
Hello, nice to meet you too!

3088
01:57:44,010 --> 01:57:44,350
Hahaha!

3089
01:57:45,710 --> 01:57:47,730
My English is fine.

3090
01:57:48,150 --> 01:57:48,770
Hahaha!

3091
01:57:49,890 --> 01:57:51,710
Your English is amazing.

3092
01:57:51,770 --> 01:57:52,930
It's beautiful.

3093
01:57:53,270 --> 01:57:54,230
It is great.

3094
01:57:54,510 --> 01:57:54,730
Oh!

3095
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:55,650
Hahaha!

3096
01:57:56,130 --> 01:57:57,050
Hahaha!

3097
01:57:59,230 --> 01:58:04,250
What did you do?

3098
01:58:04,570 --> 01:58:04,910
Haha!

3099
01:58:04,910 --> 01:58:05,110
What did you do?

3100
01:58:05,110 --> 01:58:07,550
I want to take my dressbook.

3101
01:58:08,410 --> 01:58:09,330
Hahaha!

3102
01:58:09,470 --> 01:58:10,110
Hahaha!

3103
01:58:10,110 --> 01:58:10,650
Hahaha!

3104
01:58:11,870 --> 01:58:13,090
She died.

3105
01:58:13,750 --> 01:58:16,150
Yes, yes.

3106
01:58:17,450 --> 01:58:18,650
Bless me.

3107
01:58:18,890 --> 01:58:19,550
Hahaha!

3108
01:58:19,550 --> 01:58:20,550
Good luck!

3109
01:58:20,710 --> 01:58:21,590
Bless me.

3110
01:58:25,910 --> 01:58:27,310
This is Cory.

3111
01:58:27,690 --> 01:58:28,830
His name is Cory.

3112
01:58:29,730 --> 01:58:30,230
Cory?

3113
01:58:30,450 --> 01:58:31,650
Hello hello.

3114
01:58:31,970 --> 01:58:32,510
So what are you doing?

3115
01:58:32,650 --> 01:58:35,190
You locked the three of us in the box.

3116
01:58:35,410 --> 01:58:36,210
It's good looking.

3117
01:58:36,490 --> 01:58:37,450
Do you think it's good looking?

3118
01:58:37,650 --> 01:58:38,450
It's good looking too.

3119
01:58:41,130 --> 01:58:41,850
I'm dead!

3120
01:58:42,210 --> 01:58:43,070
I'm dehydrated!

3121
01:58:46,230 --> 01:58:47,030
I'm thirsty.

3122
01:58:48,270 --> 01:58:50,710
I want to drink something.

3123
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:52,230
Help me.

3124
01:58:52,910 --> 01:58:53,770
I'm out of water.

3125
01:58:56,710 --> 01:58:58,390
I don't have water.

3126
01:58:58,610 --> 01:58:59,930
I'm going to dehydrate.

3127
01:59:07,690 --> 01:59:08,510
I'm okay.

3128
01:59:12,170 --> 01:59:14,570
Do you guys have water?

3129
01:59:17,610 --> 01:59:18,570
Oh my god.

3130
01:59:18,590 --> 01:59:19,470
I can't see anything.

3131
01:59:20,130 --> 01:59:21,250
Oh my god.

3132
01:59:22,290 --> 01:59:24,130
Remember to always hydrate.

3133
01:59:25,650 --> 01:59:25,750
Wait.

3134
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:27,330
How come I can't see anything now?

3135
01:59:27,890 --> 01:59:29,190
I can't see names.

3136
01:59:32,530 --> 01:59:33,330
Oh no.

3137
01:59:33,390 --> 01:59:33,630
Guys.

3138
01:59:33,790 --> 01:59:35,510
I can't see anything on my screen.

3139
01:59:35,630 --> 01:59:36,250
What happened?

3140
01:59:39,510 --> 01:59:40,590
What happened?

3141
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:42,730
There's no more water.

3142
01:59:45,230 --> 01:59:46,810
Did you hide your UI?

3143
01:59:47,410 --> 01:59:47,950
Wait.

3144
01:59:48,030 --> 01:59:49,250
My UI is gone.

3145
01:59:51,290 --> 01:59:53,370
I don't know what that is.

3146
01:59:57,210 --> 01:59:58,010
Oh my god.

3147
01:59:58,050 --> 01:59:59,170
I can't see your name.

3148
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:00,990
Oh.

3149
02:00:01,130 --> 02:00:01,490
Okay.

3150
02:00:01,550 --> 02:00:01,870
Never mind.

3151
02:00:02,010 --> 02:00:03,030
It's because I pushed backspace.

3152
02:00:03,150 --> 02:00:03,930
I figured it out.

3153
02:00:04,110 --> 02:00:05,290
I pressed the wrong button.

3154
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:05,670
Oh yeah.

3155
02:00:05,670 --> 02:00:06,030
Do you have water?

3156
02:00:07,130 --> 02:00:08,650
Apparently, I fixed it.

3157
02:00:08,650 --> 02:00:09,010
Yeah.

3158
02:00:09,170 --> 02:00:09,270
Yeah.

3159
02:00:09,330 --> 02:00:09,550
Yeah.

3160
02:00:09,550 --> 02:00:10,270
I fixed it.

3161
02:00:10,370 --> 02:00:10,650
Yeah.

3162
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:11,310
Okay.

3163
02:00:12,850 --> 02:00:14,590
I think you have my bottle right?

3164
02:00:14,650 --> 02:00:14,870
Yeah.

3165
02:00:14,910 --> 02:00:14,990
Yeah.

3166
02:00:14,990 --> 02:00:15,590
I have a canteen.

3167
02:00:15,610 --> 02:00:16,970
But I don't know where to get water.

3168
02:00:18,270 --> 02:00:19,610
There's no water in there already?

3169
02:00:19,670 --> 02:00:19,890
Okay.

3170
02:00:22,270 --> 02:00:22,990
I'm dehydrated.

3171
02:00:23,250 --> 02:00:23,630
I'm dehydrated.

3172
02:00:24,830 --> 02:00:25,230
Yay!

3173
02:00:28,030 --> 02:00:28,430
Wait.

3174
02:00:28,470 --> 02:00:29,550
Where's... What's Nachan doing?

3175
02:00:33,550 --> 02:00:33,950
Wait.

3176
02:00:34,070 --> 02:00:34,270
Oh wait.

3177
02:00:34,330 --> 02:00:35,790
Can you just throw me into the water?

3178
02:00:35,890 --> 02:00:37,090
And then I get water from that?

3179
02:00:41,990 --> 02:00:42,390
Oh!

3180
02:00:44,350 --> 02:00:44,750
Okay.

3181
02:00:44,990 --> 02:00:45,550
I drink.

3182
02:00:47,530 --> 02:00:47,930
Wait.

3183
02:00:48,010 --> 02:00:48,110
What?

3184
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:48,870
Wait.

3185
02:00:48,910 --> 02:00:49,270
Wait.

3186
02:00:49,290 --> 02:00:49,650
Wait.

3187
02:00:49,650 --> 02:00:50,010
Wait.

3188
02:00:50,170 --> 02:00:50,490
Wait.

3189
02:00:50,810 --> 02:00:51,210
Wait.

3190
02:00:51,210 --> 02:00:51,470
Wait.

3191
02:00:54,330 --> 02:00:54,730
Wait.

3192
02:00:55,810 --> 02:00:56,930
Oh my god.

3193
02:00:59,310 --> 02:01:00,290
I'm 1 HP.

3194
02:01:01,010 --> 02:01:01,730
Pick me up.

3195
02:01:01,910 --> 02:01:02,270
Pick me up.

3196
02:01:02,330 --> 02:01:02,750
Pick me up.

3197
02:01:09,810 --> 02:01:11,050
And I'm dying.

3198
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:12,950
No!

3199
02:01:13,610 --> 02:01:16,680
I'm broken!

3200
02:01:18,860 --> 02:01:19,260
Wait.

3201
02:01:19,340 --> 02:01:19,380
Wait.

3202
02:01:19,420 --> 02:01:19,500
Wait.

3203
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:20,060
I'm still alive.

3204
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:21,300
I'm still alive.

3205
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:23,040
Okay.

3206
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:24,500
And I pooped a little bit.

3207
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:25,340
Oh my god.

3208
02:01:25,460 --> 02:01:26,120
Oh my god.

3209
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:26,620
Oh my god.

3210
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:27,040
It's okay.

3211
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:28,500
My bones are back to normal.

3212
02:01:28,860 --> 02:01:30,120
My bones are back.

3213
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:33,240
It's okay.

3214
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:35,780
It just magically healed.

3215
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:47,380
If you got slapped by a prehistoric animal, you too would poop out of fear.

3216
02:01:47,540 --> 02:01:48,260
Don't lie.

3217
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:53,700
You'd do it if it was a rhino from modern creatures.

3218
02:01:56,700 --> 02:01:57,520
I'm alive!

3219
02:01:57,720 --> 02:01:58,020
I'm alive!

3220
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:03,180
Oh my god, pick me up!

3221
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:03,860
I'm so s-

3222
02:02:13,380 --> 02:02:15,980
When did I die?

3223
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:23,250
No fucking way!

3224
02:02:23,950 --> 02:02:25,230
When did I die?

3225
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:32,450
Guys, we're in hell.

3226
02:02:34,450 --> 02:02:34,530
Okay.

3227
02:02:35,310 --> 02:02:38,650
What the f- Did you bleed?

3228
02:02:39,670 --> 02:02:40,710
Bleed it?

3229
02:02:46,110 --> 02:02:47,850
It's the huge X.

3230
02:02:48,130 --> 02:02:49,570
There's a huge X.

3231
02:02:50,630 --> 02:02:52,570
Where the fuck is the X?

3232
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:54,490
What do you mean a huge X?

3233
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:02,240
Everything went- Where are you?

3234
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:04,880
Where- Oh!

3235
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:06,160
There it is!

3236
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:08,600
Wait, I found it!

3237
02:03:08,820 --> 02:03:09,300
Guys!

3238
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:12,260
Guys, I found it.

3239
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:13,900
I am at...

3240
02:03:13,900 --> 02:03:16,300
I am- What bed am I in?

3241
02:03:16,980 --> 02:03:18,580
What the fuck am I?

3242
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:20,160
I'm- Oh wait.

3243
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:22,500
I spawned...

3244
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:25,320
at the...

3245
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:27,260
bide.

3246
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:30,700
Oh my god, wait, is this a dinosaur?

3247
02:03:31,620 --> 02:03:32,880
Oh my god, it is!

3248
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:36,680
Wait, is this dinosaur meant to...

3249
02:03:37,260 --> 02:03:38,260
for spawning?

3250
02:03:39,980 --> 02:03:41,200
What the fuck?

3251
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:45,340
Oh, that was what's being tamed.

3252
02:03:46,980 --> 02:03:47,660
Bide?

3253
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:49,700
Oh, I don't know.

3254
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:50,940
It's like...

3255
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:53,540
It's like...

3256
02:03:54,980 --> 02:03:57,960
I don't know what the fuck is that.

3257
02:04:02,020 --> 02:04:03,880
Oh, oh, it's a Shrider!

3258
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:04,140
Shrider!

3259
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:06,140
Um...

3260
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:09,040
Tech Shrider.

3261
02:04:11,820 --> 02:04:12,460
Strider.

3262
02:04:13,860 --> 02:04:15,140
It's blue...

3263
02:04:15,140 --> 02:04:16,800
and tall...

3264
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:17,680
and metal.

3265
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:19,060
Oh, tall.

3266
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:26,620
This is it.

3267
02:04:26,620 --> 02:04:28,160
This is where- This is where I live.

3268
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:29,120
No, my bikini!

3269
02:04:30,180 --> 02:04:30,820
No!

3270
02:04:31,620 --> 02:04:32,920
Wait, I have glasses!

3271
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:35,400
Wait, not grindable.

3272
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:36,520
Hello?

3273
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:36,580
Hello?

3274
02:04:37,460 --> 02:04:38,120
Hello?

3275
02:04:40,270 --> 02:04:41,100
Oh my god.

3276
02:04:41,660 --> 02:04:45,800
I'm dead.

3277
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:46,880
I just died.

3278
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:49,160
Kiro killed me.

3279
02:04:51,310 --> 02:04:52,260
Yeah, he killed me.

3280
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:53,800
Oh my god!

3281
02:04:56,330 --> 02:04:57,320
You have...

3282
02:04:59,310 --> 02:04:59,980
Oh my god.

3283
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:01,380
Oh my god.

3284
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:03,260
I'm being fed by the...

3285
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:04,700
Oh my god.

3286
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:05,480
Thank you.

3287
02:05:05,480 --> 02:05:06,040
Thank you.

3288
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:06,760
I'm dead.

3289
02:05:15,810 --> 02:05:18,450
I'm waiting for Kiro to pick me up.

3290
02:05:19,130 --> 02:05:20,290
I don't even know where I am.

3291
02:05:20,970 --> 02:05:21,950
I want to hear it.

3292
02:05:21,990 --> 02:05:23,010
It's so poetic.

3293
02:05:24,710 --> 02:05:25,610
Every time!

3294
02:05:26,590 --> 02:05:28,230
Every fucking bug!

3295
02:05:31,070 --> 02:05:32,530
Like, are you serious?

3296
02:05:35,620 --> 02:05:38,040
Every time I get on a fi- Every time!

3297
02:05:40,660 --> 02:05:42,900
Every insect fucked me over.

3298
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:48,160
We're back.

3299
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:49,380
We're back.

3300
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:53,520
Every insect has fucked me over.

3301
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:56,740
I had one that killed me several times.

3302
02:05:57,020 --> 02:06:01,240
And then another one, literally, got on the fucking insect mount.

3303
02:06:01,380 --> 02:06:02,340
And then I died.

3304
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:03,620
My PC died.

3305
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:04,880
My aim.

3306
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:05,800
My PC died.

3307
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:11,180
All bugs are against me.

3308
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:14,060
I just want my loot bag.

3309
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:18,580
I want my...

3310
02:06:18,580 --> 02:06:21,480
Please, please don't put me in the cage!

3311
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:24,820
Don't put me in the cage!

3312
02:06:30,620 --> 02:06:31,420
Please!

3313
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:34,480
Don't put me in the cage!

3314
02:06:40,240 --> 02:06:41,380
I'm scared.

3315
02:06:41,720 --> 02:06:43,600
I'm scared I'm gonna be...

3316
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:45,240
They'll be like...

3317
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:47,180
She crashed.

3318
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:49,480
She started to put Doki in the cage.

3319
02:06:53,980 --> 02:06:55,400
Oh my god.

3320
02:06:55,460 --> 02:06:56,460
I'm so scared.

3321
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:59,180
Please don't put me in the cage.

3322
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:04,600
I'm so scared.

3323
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:09,340
I'm scared that he's gonna realize I crashed and then...

3324
02:07:09,340 --> 02:07:11,240
And then just locks me up.

3325
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:14,080
It's not looking...

3326
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:15,460
I thought we were friends.

3327
02:07:15,460 --> 02:07:17,700
We spoke Cantonese to each other.

3328
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:20,860
Hello?

3329
02:07:21,100 --> 02:07:21,700
No!

3330
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:23,840
No!

3331
02:07:25,460 --> 02:07:27,360
Oh my god!

3332
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:28,120
Why?

3333
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:29,080
Why?

3334
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:30,260
Why?

3335
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:30,520
Why?

3336
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:30,760
Why?

3337
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:31,220
Why?

3338
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:33,340
Why?

3339
02:07:37,890 --> 02:07:39,290
Oh my god!

3340
02:07:42,210 --> 02:07:44,790
Why did you put me in there?

3341
02:07:44,950 --> 02:07:46,190
Why did you put me in there?

3342
02:07:52,170 --> 02:07:53,290
It's so big.

3343
02:07:53,350 --> 02:07:55,410
But I think if I'm here, I won't be able to see.

3344
02:07:55,610 --> 02:07:57,170
If I'm here, I won't be able to see.

3345
02:07:59,190 --> 02:08:00,570
Oh my god!

3346
02:08:00,810 --> 02:08:01,930
Oh my god!

3347
02:08:02,190 --> 02:08:04,110
She almost put me in the cage.

3348
02:08:05,530 --> 02:08:06,050
Hero!

3349
02:08:06,290 --> 02:08:06,730
Hero!

3350
02:08:06,730 --> 02:08:08,070
Ew, that's a huge peanut.

3351
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:12,070
Oh my god.

3352
02:08:12,930 --> 02:08:16,830
Oh my god, she almost put me in the cage!

3353
02:08:17,250 --> 02:08:18,450
Oh my god!

3354
02:08:18,770 --> 02:08:20,590
That was so scary!

3355
02:08:21,450 --> 02:08:24,810
I almost got fucking put in the cage!

3356
02:08:26,070 --> 02:08:27,290
Oh my god.

3357
02:08:27,550 --> 02:08:29,970
Wait, are these in the cage?!

3358
02:08:29,970 --> 02:08:30,430
What?

3359
02:08:30,650 --> 02:08:32,230
The peanut had a peanut on it.

3360
02:08:37,130 --> 02:08:40,760
It's like a peanut on a peanut!

3361
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:45,900
I was like, I'm going to go to the cage.

3362
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:48,640
Everyone was like, okay.

3363
02:08:50,350 --> 02:08:51,360
No, I was like...

3364
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:54,000
That could have been me!

3365
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:56,600
It could have been me!

3366
02:08:57,480 --> 02:08:57,880
So cold.

3367
02:08:58,820 --> 02:09:01,100
I was like, I'm going to go to the cage.

3368
02:09:04,700 --> 02:09:07,960
Oh my god, she almost got me!

3369
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:09,380
Oh my god, I called it!

3370
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:10,960
I fucking called it!

3371
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:11,720
I knew it, guys!

3372
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,720
I fucking called it, guys!

3373
02:09:14,180 --> 02:09:17,000
I knew she wanted to put me in the cage!

3374
02:09:17,660 --> 02:09:18,980
I fucking knew it!

3375
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:21,860
Oh my god, that was so close.

3376
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:24,860
She's the collector.

3377
02:09:26,060 --> 02:09:27,300
Holy shit!

3378
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:30,760
What happened last time?

3379
02:09:30,980 --> 02:09:32,360
Yeah, I got saved.

3380
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:32,900
Alright.

3381
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:35,420
I got saved.

3382
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:37,740
Dude, I... Huh?

3383
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:39,280
What?

3384
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:40,580
What?

3385
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:41,340
What?

3386
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:41,720
What?

3387
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:41,820
What?

3388
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:45,460
Oh my god!

3389
02:09:45,720 --> 02:09:46,880
Are you crazy?

3390
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:48,420

02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:13,500
Hey, she's crazy!

3396
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:14,180

Hit her!

3402
02:10:25,690 --> 02:10:26,490
Save me!

3403
02:10:27,210 --> 02:10:28,310
I don't care.

3404
02:10:29,090 --> 02:10:29,730
Hahahaha!

3405
02:10:32,550 --> 02:10:33,190

Oh my god!

3409
02:10:47,190 --> 02:10:48,830
Go Mera!

3410
02:10:50,110 --> 02:10:50,870
Go!

3411
02:10:53,870 --> 02:10:55,270
No!

3412
02:11:03,930 --> 02:11:05,250
Go Mera!

3413
02:11:07,790 --> 02:11:08,950

3416
02:11:13,410 --> 02:11:14,670
I can't sleep!

3417
02:11:15,510 --> 02:11:16,230
Go on!

3418
02:11:16,770 --> 02:11:17,830
Go Mera!

3420
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:32,440
Oh my god!

3421
02:11:33,100 --> 02:11:34,220
Go on!

3422
02:11:34,660 --> 02:11:35,740
Mera!

3423
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:42,420
Hit him!

3424
02:11:47,550 --> 02:11:49,090
Hit him!

3425
02:11:52,170 --> 02:11:54,570
Hit him!

3426
02:11:55,910 --> 02:11:56,770
Save me!

3427
02:11:57,050 --> 02:11:58,050
She's crazy!

3428
02:12:02,230 --> 02:12:03,210
Help me!

3429
02:12:10,730 --> 02:12:11,430
Crazy!

3430
02:12:15,290 --> 02:12:18,830
He fucking knocked me out and put me in a cage!

3431
02:12:21,190 --> 02:12:22,570
He shot me!

3432
02:12:25,190 --> 02:12:26,570
What the fuck?

3433
02:12:28,350 --> 02:12:28,910
Hiro!

3434
02:12:29,590 --> 02:12:30,150
Hiro!

3435
02:12:30,630 --> 02:12:32,150
Let me out, Hiro!

3436
02:12:32,850 --> 02:12:33,570
I got it.

3437
02:12:33,730 --> 02:12:34,650
I got it so bad.

3438
02:12:34,650 --> 02:12:35,690
Hiro, you were right!

3439
02:12:36,030 --> 02:12:38,070
Hiro, you were right, Hiro!

3440
02:12:41,350 --> 02:12:45,170
Oh, thank you!

3441
02:12:45,330 --> 02:12:45,990
Okay.

3442
02:12:46,150 --> 02:12:47,890
I thought I would get out of the handcuffs.

3443
02:12:52,030 --> 02:12:57,790
Oh my god.

3444
02:12:57,950 --> 02:12:58,550
No!

3445
02:12:59,010 --> 02:13:00,850
I'm not okay!

3446
02:13:05,170 --> 02:13:08,050
He put me in a cage!

3447
02:13:08,070 --> 02:13:09,670
Yeah, he's hurting.

3448
02:13:09,870 --> 02:13:10,590
I called you.

3449
02:13:10,630 --> 02:13:11,510
You were right!

3450
02:13:11,670 --> 02:13:12,710
You were right!

3451
02:13:20,310 --> 02:13:21,090
Don't worry.

3452
02:13:21,250 --> 02:13:24,290
I put some shit in his... in her home.

3453
02:13:24,430 --> 02:13:24,910
Don't worry.

3454
02:13:25,250 --> 02:13:27,490
He put some shit!

3455
02:13:31,330 --> 02:13:32,390
My Hiro.

3456
02:13:32,730 --> 02:13:33,810
My Hiro.

3457
02:13:34,530 --> 02:13:36,410
Wait, where's my... do you know where my...

3459
02:13:37,070 --> 02:13:37,590
Don't worry.

3460
02:13:38,070 --> 02:13:38,410
Don't worry.

3461
02:13:38,490 --> 02:13:39,330
You've got to help me.

3462
02:13:43,330 --> 02:13:47,090
Look over here, look over here.

3463
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:47,930
Oh my god.

3464
02:13:48,130 --> 02:13:50,510
She has so many people in cages!

3465
02:13:50,530 --> 02:13:51,590
Look at this!

3466
02:13:58,510 --> 02:13:59,170
Goodbye.

3467
02:14:04,450 --> 02:14:05,330
Goodbye.

3468
02:14:06,990 --> 02:14:07,870
Goodbye.

3469
02:14:15,970 --> 02:14:20,630
Oh my god.

3470
02:14:20,730 --> 02:14:22,570
Do you know where my body is?

3471
02:14:26,630 --> 02:14:27,430
Yeah, yeah.

3472
02:14:28,350 --> 02:14:32,250
Can you take me... I want my bikini back.

3473
02:14:36,530 --> 02:14:37,810
Wait, what do I have?

3474
02:14:40,590 --> 02:14:41,990
Oh, I have water, Jai.

3475
02:14:43,130 --> 02:14:44,750
Oh my god, she gave me water.

3476
02:14:47,350 --> 02:14:48,470
I have a whip now.

3477
02:14:53,450 --> 02:14:53,930
Bad!

3478
02:14:53,930 --> 02:14:54,410
Bad!

3479
02:15:01,790 --> 02:15:03,610
She gave me a whip.

3480
02:15:06,850 --> 02:15:09,330
Can you bring me back to my body?

3481
02:15:10,790 --> 02:15:11,210
Yeah, I can.

3482
02:15:13,030 --> 02:15:15,130
I'm gonna give you something.

3483
02:15:15,550 --> 02:15:16,310
Oh, yes.

3484
02:15:16,570 --> 02:15:17,990
I want... what is this?

3485
02:15:18,370 --> 02:15:19,950
Oh my god, your blood!

3486
02:15:20,470 --> 02:15:22,830
Don't worry, I'll keep it forever.

3487
02:15:23,350 --> 02:15:23,910
Okay.

3488
02:15:24,410 --> 02:15:25,770
Goodbye, everybody.

3489
02:15:29,930 --> 02:15:31,250
Bye-bye.

3490
02:15:31,930 --> 02:15:32,670
Bye-bye.

3491
02:15:32,670 --> 02:15:33,130
Bye-bye.

3492
02:15:36,490 --> 02:15:39,270
Alright, I want my stuff back.

3493
02:15:39,450 --> 02:15:40,550
I want my bikini back.

3494
02:15:42,630 --> 02:15:44,750
The crazy person gave me a whip.

3495
02:15:45,170 --> 02:15:45,790
Ha!

3496
02:15:48,590 --> 02:15:53,330
Oh, she freaky... I'm not the freaky one!

3497
02:15:53,530 --> 02:15:54,390
She gave me a whip!

3498
02:15:54,390 --> 02:15:55,310
She gave me the whip!

3499
02:15:59,950 --> 02:16:02,110
I can't believe... I fucking knew it.

3500
02:16:04,390 --> 02:16:06,450
Yeah, the crazy person gave me the whip.

3501
02:16:08,630 --> 02:16:10,990
And then they like locked me in a cage.

3502
02:16:14,310 --> 02:16:16,730
She was like... she was like...

3503
02:16:17,230 --> 02:16:17,850
Yeah, yeah.

3504
02:16:17,950 --> 02:16:19,250
She was like, look at this.

3505
02:16:19,390 --> 02:16:24,310
And then she pulled a gun and then knocked me out and then put me in a cage.

3506
02:16:26,610 --> 02:16:28,790
It was... it was so scary.

3507
02:16:29,650 --> 02:16:31,190
I don't know why it's like that.

3508
02:16:33,930 --> 02:16:35,350
Did you die?

3509
02:16:35,470 --> 02:16:36,050
Was it here?

3510
02:16:36,350 --> 02:16:37,050
I think so.

3511
02:16:37,490 --> 02:16:38,210
Was it?

3512
02:16:38,630 --> 02:16:39,530
I don't remember.

3513
02:16:39,670 --> 02:16:39,930
Oh, wait.

3514
02:16:41,610 --> 02:16:43,350
Where did I die?

3515
02:16:46,850 --> 02:16:47,830
Wait, I have a map.

3516
02:16:48,750 --> 02:16:50,010
Okay, I can't...

3517
02:16:50,010 --> 02:16:51,150
I think it's here.

3518
02:16:51,510 --> 02:16:52,230
Was it here?

3519
02:16:52,450 --> 02:16:52,630
Where?

3520
02:16:52,630 --> 02:16:54,150
I don't see like the light.

3521
02:16:59,050 --> 02:17:00,190
Oh, I see it.

3522
02:17:00,210 --> 02:17:00,510
I see it.

3523
02:17:00,590 --> 02:17:00,890
It's here.

3524
02:17:00,950 --> 02:17:01,210
It's here.

3525
02:17:02,070 --> 02:17:03,050
It's like... wait.

3526
02:17:03,250 --> 02:17:04,410
Oh my god, Nachan died!

3527
02:17:05,990 --> 02:17:07,830
Yeah, she's dying now.

3528
02:17:08,290 --> 02:17:09,310
She's trying to get her...

3529
02:17:10,130 --> 02:17:12,270
Okay, I got my stuff back.

3530
02:17:12,410 --> 02:17:14,830
Let me put my... let me put my bikini on.

3531
02:17:15,990 --> 02:17:16,390
Yay!

3532
02:17:18,170 --> 02:17:19,350
Okay, now I'm beautiful.

3533
02:17:20,050 --> 02:17:20,450
Alright.

3534
02:17:21,450 --> 02:17:21,850
Nice.

3535
02:17:22,670 --> 02:17:23,190
Yay!

3536
02:17:23,790 --> 02:17:24,730
Where are we going?

3537
02:17:24,970 --> 02:17:25,990
Don't call me, Nachan.

3538
02:17:26,510 --> 02:17:28,550
I will try and...

3539
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:30,840
Okay.

3540
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:31,920
Okay.

3541
02:17:33,620 --> 02:17:35,500
Alright, we're gonna go to Nachan now.

3542
02:17:35,860 --> 02:17:37,920
Actually, yeah, I can try and do something.

3543
02:17:38,580 --> 02:17:39,320
Oh, okay.

3544
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:42,040
It's like a new...

3545
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:45,340
Oh my god.

3546
02:17:45,500 --> 02:17:47,440
Oh my god, nothing is loading in yet.

3547
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:50,160
It's draining, yeah.

3548
02:17:50,220 --> 02:17:51,180
It's draining right now.

3549
02:17:52,620 --> 02:17:53,980
You must be... what?

3550
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:54,800
I'm a little...

3551
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:57,140
No, Nachan, no!

3552
02:17:57,340 --> 02:17:58,600
Live for me!

3553
02:17:59,020 --> 02:17:59,200
Okay.

3554
02:18:00,640 --> 02:18:01,320
Oh?

3555
02:18:01,320 --> 02:18:02,120
Who's that?

3556
02:18:02,400 --> 02:18:02,560
What are you doing?

3557
02:18:04,820 --> 02:18:06,280
I'm a little...

3558
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:07,960
I'm a little...

3559
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:08,920
I'm not here right now.

3560
02:18:09,020 --> 02:18:09,680
Ah,

3561
02:18:12,760 --> 02:18:13,520
okay, okay.

3562
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:15,340
You can come back.

3563
02:18:15,600 --> 02:18:16,280
Together?

3564
02:18:17,120 --> 02:18:17,820
Okay, together.

3565
02:18:18,080 --> 02:18:20,260
You can come back with us.

3566
02:18:21,220 --> 02:18:21,900
Okay.

3567
02:18:24,020 --> 02:18:25,760
She's a family.

3568
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:28,020
Nice.

3569
02:18:28,340 --> 02:18:28,820
Nice.

3570
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:31,840
It's okay.

3571
02:18:32,220 --> 02:18:32,900
Yeah, family.

3572
02:18:34,140 --> 02:18:35,880
Yes, yes.

3573
02:18:36,860 --> 02:18:38,620
Oh my god, it's okay.

3574
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:41,340
As long as she doesn't put me in the cage, I'm fine.

3575
02:18:44,620 --> 02:18:46,360
Wait, Nachan died again?

3576
02:18:48,060 --> 02:18:49,540
Thank you, Hiro.

3577
02:18:49,860 --> 02:18:50,560
I'm sorry.

3578
02:18:56,420 --> 02:18:57,420
Oh no.

3579
02:18:58,620 --> 02:19:00,180
Nachan's still dead.

3580
02:19:01,400 --> 02:19:03,060
Am I pooping in the sky?

3581
02:19:03,680 --> 02:19:04,280
Where?

3582
02:19:04,620 --> 02:19:05,540
Nachan is dying.

3583
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:07,500
Yeah, she's dying non-stop.

3584
02:19:07,560 --> 02:19:08,320
Oh my god.

3585
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:08,740
Oh no!

3586
02:19:08,900 --> 02:19:10,040
Nachan, don't worry!

3587
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:10,800
I'll save you!

3588
02:19:12,440 --> 02:19:13,040
Nachan!

3589
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:14,100
I'll save you!

3590
02:19:15,860 --> 02:19:17,520
My inventory's too heavy!

3591
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:19,600
Where is Nachan?

3592
02:19:19,620 --> 02:19:20,420
Wait, where is Nachan?

3593
02:19:23,910 --> 02:19:24,930
Where is she?

3594
02:19:26,850 --> 02:19:27,630
Oh no.

3595
02:19:29,350 --> 02:19:30,290
Where is she?

3596
02:19:30,470 --> 02:19:31,610
Wait, there she... oh wait, no.

3597
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:33,430
She's not there.

3598
02:19:35,030 --> 02:19:35,910
Oh no.

3599
02:19:36,870 --> 02:19:37,790
Oh my god.

3600
02:19:38,550 --> 02:19:38,750
Ah!

3601
02:19:39,050 --> 02:19:41,470
He took my... suit.

3602
02:19:41,850 --> 02:19:43,670
Wait, I should throw some stuff away.

3603
02:19:43,750 --> 02:19:44,590
I have too much stuff.

3604
02:19:44,790 --> 02:19:46,350
Yeah, guys, I have too much!

3605
02:19:47,250 --> 02:19:48,450
What the fuck?

3606
02:19:48,950 --> 02:19:49,850
Okay, we're good.

3607
02:19:49,990 --> 02:19:52,550
We have like the same armor.

3608
02:19:52,810 --> 02:19:54,910
A lot of the same armor.

3609
02:19:54,910 --> 02:19:55,910
Not gonna lie.

3610
02:19:57,050 --> 02:19:58,270
Okay, let's see.

3611
02:20:00,070 --> 02:20:02,310
Green is... green is the weak one.

3612
02:20:02,510 --> 02:20:04,350
Okay, I have a lot of these skins.

3613
02:20:04,630 --> 02:20:06,310
I don't think we need like 500.

3614
02:20:07,030 --> 02:20:07,630
Oh my god.

3615
02:20:07,690 --> 02:20:07,950
Oh my...

3616
02:20:07,950 --> 02:20:08,530
Okay.

3617
02:20:10,430 --> 02:20:10,990
No!

3618
02:20:14,750 --> 02:20:16,410
Where is Nachan?

3619
02:20:17,830 --> 02:20:18,950
Ah, I saw her.

3620
02:20:20,450 --> 02:20:21,010
Nachan!

3621
02:20:22,550 --> 02:20:23,430
You're alive!

3622
02:20:25,030 --> 02:20:26,550
Oh my god.

3623
02:20:26,550 --> 02:20:26,970
Nachan!

3624
02:20:26,970 --> 02:20:28,030
Oh my god.

3625
02:20:28,390 --> 02:20:29,050
What are you?

3626
02:20:31,910 --> 02:20:32,670
Nachan!

3627
02:20:32,690 --> 02:20:33,070
Nachan!

3628
02:20:33,950 --> 02:20:34,710
Hi!

3629
02:20:35,150 --> 02:20:36,150
Look, Nachan.

3630
02:20:36,470 --> 02:20:37,690
Look what I have.

3631
02:20:38,290 --> 02:20:39,050
Look.

3632
02:20:46,470 --> 02:20:47,330
That's scary.

3633
02:20:49,710 --> 02:20:50,990
That's her.

3634
02:20:55,270 --> 02:20:56,830
Okay, what do I not need?

3635
02:20:57,030 --> 02:20:58,990
I don't need all of this.

3636
02:20:59,570 --> 02:21:01,630
Okay, let me drop all of this.

3637
02:21:02,510 --> 02:21:03,570
Oh my god.

3638
02:21:03,790 --> 02:21:03,910
I...

3639
02:21:05,850 --> 02:21:09,910
Okay, yeah, I have so many like duplicates from dying all the time.

3640
02:21:10,310 --> 02:21:12,350
I cannot fit all of this.

3641
02:21:13,210 --> 02:21:13,990
Okay, nice.

3642
02:21:14,170 --> 02:21:15,050
Nachan, jump.

3643
02:21:15,610 --> 02:21:16,090
Yay!

3644
02:21:17,210 --> 02:21:19,730
I'm really tired, so like I'm glad...

3645
02:21:19,730 --> 02:21:22,770
Well, I'm not glad that I crashed, but like I'm gonna...

3646
02:21:22,770 --> 02:21:25,730
I think that's like the... I think it's at that time we gotta stop.

3647
02:21:26,030 --> 02:21:28,450
I think Ark just does not like me right now.

3648
02:21:31,370 --> 02:21:32,670
So I'm gonna call it here.

3649
02:21:32,830 --> 02:21:33,710
It was fun though.

3650
02:21:33,810 --> 02:21:41,130
I'm really happy that Hiro and her friends like gave me a tour and everybody's so nice on the server.

3651
02:21:41,490 --> 02:21:44,550
I had a great time just talking, like interacting with people.

3652
02:21:45,410 --> 02:21:47,670
I hope you guys had a fun time watching too.

3653
02:21:47,870 --> 02:21:52,150
I hope all you guys had a great time just watching and being put in a fucking cage.

3654
02:21:55,910 --> 02:21:56,850
I'm gonna call it here.

3655
02:21:56,910 --> 02:21:58,350
I'm actually really tired now.

3656
02:21:58,430 --> 02:21:58,910
I'm gonna...

3657
02:21:58,910 --> 02:22:01,170
I do have like some work stuff at the answer.

3658
02:22:01,790 --> 02:22:03,330
So I'll let you guys know.

3659
02:22:03,390 --> 02:22:05,410
I'm gonna push back the satellite stream right now.

3660
02:22:05,470 --> 02:22:06,910
I'm gonna change the time for it.

3661
02:22:07,890 --> 02:22:17,850
So... and if like the fire inspector person that's supposed to check the fire alarms doesn't come by then, I might just wait until they check the alarms and then...

3662
02:22:20,510 --> 02:22:22,290
And then start the stream.

3663
02:22:22,430 --> 02:22:22,750
Okay.

3664
02:22:22,770 --> 02:22:23,910
But yeah, it was really fun.

3665
02:22:24,130 --> 02:22:24,890
I had a great time.

3666
02:22:25,130 --> 02:22:25,970
I'm gonna call it here.

3667
02:22:26,050 --> 02:22:27,130
My voice is dying.

3668
02:22:28,010 --> 02:22:29,850
I'm a bit... I'm EP now.

3669
02:22:30,030 --> 02:22:34,670
But as always everybody stay hydrated, posture checked, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3670
02:22:34,750 --> 02:22:37,450
And if you stay up for me, head to bed cause you deserve it.

3671
02:22:37,530 --> 02:22:38,470
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

3672
02:22:38,910 --> 02:22:39,590
Bye guys.

3673
02:22:40,050 --> 02:22:40,410
Bye!
