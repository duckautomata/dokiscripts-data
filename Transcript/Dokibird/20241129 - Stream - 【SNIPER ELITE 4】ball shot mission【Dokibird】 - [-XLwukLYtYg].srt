1
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,710
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,550
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,790
I am...

4
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,670
I'm very tired.

5
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,850
Because I have... Happy American Thanksgiving, by the way!

6
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,310
I took a nap.

7
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,110
I don't know what's wrong with me.

8
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,910
I don't know why I keep doing this to myself.

9
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:08,550
I'm like... I'll be like... I took a nap at like 4 p.m.

10
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,390
I was like, it'll be fine.

11
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,090
It'll be okay.

12
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,130
I can handle it.

13
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,450
It's like... I can handle it.

14
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,630
I don't know why past Stokke is always like this.

15
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,250
Past Stokke is always like... You already know... I don't know.

16
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,210
I always feel like it'll be different.

17
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,590
Every time I nap...

18
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,470
Every time I think about napping before stream, I keep telling myself, today will be different.

19
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,170
Today, my body will figure it out.

20
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,770
Like, eventually, you know?

21
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,230
Okay, so I found out.

22
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,870
Okay, this is sort of related.

23
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,170
So like...

24
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:58,710
Apparently, there's this YouTube video of this lady finding out that being lactose intolerant is literally just a skill issue.

25
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,210
You can force yourself to... By the way, don't do this.

26
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:08,210
For legal reasons, do not do this.

27
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,110
Anyway, so she found out.

28
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,090
She read a paper.

29
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:18,510
And found out that you can train your body to not be lactose intolerant.

30
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:28,090
So what she did was that she drank skim milk every single day until she stopped being lactose intolerant.

31
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,290
And it worked.

32
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:38,630
Like, it actually helped the body to realize you can actually train yourself to be less allergic to things.

33
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,900
If you just like...

34
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,830
By the way, for legal and medical reasons, do not like...

35
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,750
I'm an anime girl on the internet.

36
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,990
Please do not listen to me.

37
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:50,770
Please...

38
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,550
But I thought that video was very...

39
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,340
I thought...

40
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,920
I thought that video was...

41
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,240
Do not try this.

42
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,200
Especially if you are allergic to peanuts.

43
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,520
Do not try this if you need an EpiPen to fucking live.

44
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,220
But...

45
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,880
It was a very interesting video.

46
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,820
Not actual medical advice.

47
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,900
Anyway, I saw that video.

48
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,280
I thought I was like...

49
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,180
Apparently, lactose intolerant might be a skill issue.

50
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,580
I'm not lactose intolerant.

51
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,380
I know a lot of Asians are actually born with being lactose intolerant.

52
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,000
Because we don't have...

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,240
A lot of Asians didn't have...

54
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,460
Grew up with milk and cheese.

55
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,500
Because I guess...

56
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,820
Back in the day...

57
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,900
Hundreds of years ago...

58
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,960
When we saw...

59
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,760
I don't know...

60
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,840
Cow titty milk.

61
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,680
We were like...

62
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,220
I guess.

63
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,640
That's weird.

64
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,420
I guess.

65
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,320
I don't know.

66
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,970
And then it was brought in by...

67
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,900
The West.

68
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,890
But then we didn't...

69
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,930
Back then...

70
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,830
It's like...

71
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,780
So...

72
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,580
Cheese is like...

73
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,580
I know cheese in general is considered...

74
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,970
Considered like...

75
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,790
Like something for like Western side.

76
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,710
Bring it over.

77
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,050
It's not really an allergy.

78
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:43,970
Well, anyway.

79
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,910
But she basically drank skim milk every single day.

80
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,270
And it somehow became less lactose intolerant.

81
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,450
And...

82
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,510
So like we did...

83
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,050
So like...

84
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,630
Especially like within like Asians.

85
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,690
We don't have like the enzyme to digest it properly.

86
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,950
I don't know why we fucking suck with alcohol.

87
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,030
I remember like...

88
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,570
I don't remember the historical reason why we suck with alcohol as well.

89
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,390
For those who don't know.

90
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,290
Asians don't have the enzyme to digest alcohol properly.

91
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,290
So alcohol is considered poisonous to Asians.

92
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,990
And that's why we have the red flesh.

93
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,030
Because we don't digest it properly.

94
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:21,990
So...

95
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,310
Because we can't digest it properly.

96
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,730
We get red more easily.

97
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,430
So I don't know why...

98
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,070
The historical reasons why we can't do that.

99
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,850
But I know the milk...

100
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,390
The reasons why we're lactose intolerant.

101
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,550
I'm not lactose intolerant by the way.

102
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,870
I'm fine.

103
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,600
Luckily I like...

104
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,630
I like was fine with that.

105
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,270
But it's more poisonous to Asians.

106
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,490
And that is why we have the...

107
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,230
The red flesh that we get easily.

108
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,990
But yeah.

109
00:06:59,210 --> 00:06:59,890
So I was thinking...

110
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,950
I saw that video.

111
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,110
And then I was like...

112
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,110
I saw that video.

113
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,370
And I was like...

114
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:07,750
Oh my god.

115
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,230
What if I can do that with napping?

116
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,810
I was like...

117
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,390
Maybe eventually...

118
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,350
My body will get used to napping before stream.

119
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,390
So like when I wake up eventually...

120
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,410
Maybe I won't feel dead inside.

121
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,950
That's like...

122
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,090
That's where my mind went to.

123
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,630
So I was like...

124
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:29,990
Okay.

125
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,010
I was like...

126
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,570
Oh my god.

127
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,210
Maybe this time it will be different.

128
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,770
Maybe my body...

129
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,050
Will build a tolerance to napping before stream.

130
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,030
So when I wake up...

131
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,070
I'll be okay.

132
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,830
That's where everything connected.

133
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,330
Okay.

134
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:49,850
By the way.

135
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,410
Don't do this.

136
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,390
This is some fucking girl that read a paper...

137
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,770
In the mid 19...

138
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,570
Like early 1900s.

139
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:58,430
Okay.

140
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,070
The weirdest part...

141
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,570
Was that the paper was from the early 1900s too.

142
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,330
And then she was like...

143
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:05,990
You know what?

144
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,510
That seems right.

145
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,190
I'm gonna test that theory out.

146
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,810
And then she did that everyday.

147
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,990
And then even she was like...

148
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,030
Don't do this guys.

149
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,750
Like...

150
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,050
Yes.

151
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,090
I like...

152
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,990
Now I can like...

153
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,970
Drink milk again.

154
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,470
I can drink milk properly.

155
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,710
But she was like...

156
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,670
Don't do this guys.

157
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,590
It was not fun.

158
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,430
And I was like...

159
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,930
Like...

160
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,130
I don't know what it's like to be lactose intolerant.

161
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,850
But it definitely did not seem very fun.

162
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,870
I was like...

163
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,070
At least she can drink milk now.

164
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,550
But yeah.

165
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,130
Anyway.

166
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,490
A little fun fact about the history of milk.

167
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,430
This is why in Asia...

168
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,910
You visit Asia.

169
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:47,970
Like any country in Asia.

170
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,790
You'll see like...

171
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,810
The different flavors of milk that they have.

172
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,190
Not just like chocolate milk.

173
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:54,910
But like...

174
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,470
They'll have like banana milk.

175
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,320
And like...

176
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,770
Different types of flavors of milk.

177
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,170
Because it was saying...

178
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:01,970
Because like...

179
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,630
It actually...

180
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,050
Banana milk as well too.

181
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,210
It like...

182
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,750
Lessens the effects of lactose.

183
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,950
Those who have lactose intolerant.

184
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:10,630
It like...

185
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,530
Lessens the effect as well.

186
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,410
So like...

187
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,090
People who are lactose intolerant.

188
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,670
Will be able to drink banana milk.

189
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,590
And strawberry milk.

190
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,190
And that's why they like...

191
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,070
Had a lot of that.

192
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,070
Because they want to encourage people to drink milk more.

193
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:25,490
To like...

194
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,430
Buy milk more.

195
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,350
So that's why they did that.

196
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,790
I thought it was very interesting.

197
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,630
Uh...

198
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:31,950
Uh...

199
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,810
I thought that is incredibly interesting history.

200
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,350
Anyway guys...

201
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,850
Don't...

202
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,950
Don't fucking build up your immunity to allergy.

203
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,250
Like...

204
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,310
I mean like...

205
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,010
Do what your doctors tells you.

206
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,550
Don't listen to medical advice.

207
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,510
From anatomy girl that about to shoot...

208
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,550
Uh...

209
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,070

I...

213
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,970
I...

214
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,610
I...

215
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:06,050

216
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,730

Thank you.

233
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:51,630
Thank you You might be wake up in the middle of REM cycle, which is why you feel messed up Look up REM cycles.

234
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,850
You can min max not.

235
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,590
Yeah, I know.

236
00:10:53,790 --> 00:11:04,190
I know like the REM cycle shit I think no matter what I'm still gonna fuck it up So like I'm just trying to see like maybe I can train my body to forget about the REM cycle

237
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:17,550
Just be okay before like my body would be like you have a Stream I'd like this time just don't care about the REM

238
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:26,710
Maybe just be okay Doki, just... just be okay.

239
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,250
Alright, anyway, another life update.

240
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,850
Okay, I wrote some stuff regarding life updates.

241
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,270
For those who don't know...

242
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,430
EA slash Apex...

243
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,850
is officially sponsoring...

244
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:48,430
the prize pool for the Doki X Oversight Apex Custom!

245
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,110
Yay!

246
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,310
Oh my gosh, why am I still aimbotting?

247
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,770
Anyway, oh wait, no, I should be aimbotting.

248
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,830
I'm literally sniping.

249
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,030
Anyway, so it's official official now.

250
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:06,930
And oh my gosh, I want to say huge shout out to Tempo for doing all the paperwork for it.

251
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,190
It was like a very fast job.

252
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,130
Like we had to like figure everything out really really fast.

253
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:23,890
So like huge shout out to the devs, to staff at EA slash Apex and also Tempo for doing all the paperwork for it.

254
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:31,550
And like so like and we're also having physical prizes and also Apex coin packs.

255
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:41,390
So they were willing... at first, they were suggesting we make the custom $50,000 on top of the $30,000 I was gonna do.

256
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,670
But like I was a bit against it because I was like...

257
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,990
I felt like having a bigger prize pool.

258
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:59,030
Like it's cool to have a really big prize pool, but I figured like since this is our first custom, I was like, oh, I feel like maybe instead of that we can... I can use the extra funds.

259
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,930
You can do $20,000 and it'll still be $30,000.

260
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,590
I can use the extra funds to improve the foundation of the entire thing.

261
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:15,230
Because I figured like adding more money might like make it way too competitive than what it is.

262
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:34,230
So I said that I think it would be better and then with the extra money I save, I would be able to improve the foundations and like because they're very open to working with me and Tempo more in the future in 2025 to set up more Apex customs for the community.

263
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,750
So because of that, I figured like, oh, we could actually make this a real thing.

264
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,770
We could actually make this...

265
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,070
We could actually do more of this and like improve more upon it for next year.

266
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:50,270
So we were like, yeah, we were asking if that was possible and they were like, yeah, we can do that.

267
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:55,090
Like, but they would have to give them like what were ideas for next year and stuff like that.

268
00:13:55,150 --> 00:14:18,430
So they were like, okay, if you are actually really open and really willing to post more of these and organize more customs under Apex and under EA, like for EA and everything, we can do that and then like in the future, like next year in 2025, we can do something again in the future with me and Tempo.

269
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,550
So like we went with that route instead.

270
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,690
So I was like really happy.

271
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:32,030
Negotiations took a while regarding like the details of everything, but I'm really thankful for like EA and like Tempo for like the hard work they've all done.

272
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,410
This custom has been so hard.

273
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,850
So difficult.

274
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,650
So like, I can't wait for Saturday.

275
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:47,790
So I don't have to worry about it anymore.

276
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:56,410
But yeah, like we were given an option to make it like 50k, but I was like, I figured it would be better.

277
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:06,290
Like, especially with this being our first one, like I don't mind if this was like my fucking 10th custom and I was like, oh my god, this is the 10th custom I've ever organized.

278
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:13,850
Let's make it bigger, like the prize pool bigger, like the all-stars, the all-stars tournament and shit like that.

279
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:19,590
Then it makes sense to have like 50k, but then I was like, no, this is my first one.

280
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:28,150
Like, this is the first one I've ever organized under my name and I figured like, oh my gosh, I rather, and that's why I was like heavily pushed for like physical prizes.

281
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:41,690
And so I was very thankful for Tempo for donating like his physical, the physical Apex items that he owns, like they're all wrapped by the way.

282
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,230
It's all like unopened and everything.

283
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:48,610
So because I was like pushing for the physical prizes because it like adds more to the fun factor.

284
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:57,890
And then we told teams like, oh, if you won a physical prize already, if you won the Apex coin packs already, it would be great.

285
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:13,950
We kindly asked them if they could like give the team below them, like the team that ranked below them, a chance to receive the physical prizes and like the coin packs because like, you know, we want everyone to have a chance to win something basically.

286
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:25,530
So like, oh, if you haven't won, because like, you know, you know, it like it's like very limited, the physical prizes and I feel like it's, you know, if you win one of the physical prizes, like it's second and third place.

287
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:37,850
So like if the second third place, they both won those before, then fourth and fifth place can have like, can also have like a physical and the coin pack prizes as well.

288
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:43,990
And everybody that joins what's 45,000 coin pack worth, it's like $40.

289
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,930
I think it's like 40 to $50.

290
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:57,410
So and everybody that participates gets a 2100 Apex coin packs.

291
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,890
So everyone that participated will also receive their coin packs as well.

292
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,850
So it's not like so everybody gets something type deal.

293
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,090
So yeah, yeah.

294
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:16,290
So yeah, we're trying to try to make sure that everybody gets something.

295
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:20,570
So like, you know, they participated and they received something out of it and said nothing in general.

296
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,470
I also received the pins and stuff.

297
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:34,010
I just, you know, I want to be thankful for them to giving up their time being here and like, like wanting to, you know, join us and stuff like wanting to play, play and be part of this too.

298
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:40,490
So it's all like being like encouraging more participations in the future for other events that I host in the future.

299
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,510
Cryptic, thank you for the super chat.

300
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:42,810
Thank you.

301
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,450
Thank you.

302
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:48,850
Look Doki, I get the sentiment, but I think that meant something different when you talk about Thanksgiving ball games.

303
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,270
Thank you for the super chat.

304
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:50,610
Thank you.

305
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,110
Thank you.

306
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:51,790
Party ball.

307
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,030
Thank you for the magenta soup.

308
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,830
I think thank you.

309
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,010
I'm glad EA sponsored for the custom got finalized.

310
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:05,730
Excited hearing you and EA might work for future customs as well, but hope you can share your work with your team for future events.

311
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,510
Worry that you get over exhausted for every event you organize.

312
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,370
Thank you for the magenta soup, buddy.

313
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,010
Thank you.

314
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:21,910
Yeah, like after this, I'm definitely, I'm definitely gonna try and delegate my task in the future.

315
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:28,270
Because like, yeah, just so I could save time for things.

316
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:34,570
Because organizing this custom has like seeped into my other stuff that I should be doing.

317
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:41,350
But because I'm already doing all of it myself, my team doesn't know what they need to be done.

318
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,610
So I'm definitely learning a lot from that.

319
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,430
So I'm, I'm definitely gonna try and delegate after.

320
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:55,310
I know I said that for WrestleTuber, but this time for sure, I'm gonna start delegating for sure this time.

321
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,210
I swear, guys.

322
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,310
I swear.

323
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,230
Um, Nexy, thank you for the super chat.

324
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:01,550
Thank you.

325
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:01,950
Thank you.

326
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:06,350
Did you know you can train yourself to have a polyphasic sleep schedule where you just live on short naps?

327
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,450
Thank you for the super chat.

328
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:07,770
Thank you.

329
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,190
Thank you.

330
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:16,670
You see, I know like some people do that, but I feel like the long-term effects will fuck you up.

331
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,330
Because Tempo does that.

332
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,770
Tempo actually goes with that sleep schedule.

333
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,570
I don't know how the fuck he functions sometimes.

334
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,890
But like, I mean, like, we've seen his streams.

335
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,050
Sometimes he's not okay.

336
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:40,870
Like the Twitch Rivals I did with him, and he put on the fucking jigsaw mask, and then you're like, oh, I understand now.

337
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,880
But he actually, he actually does that sleep schedule.

338
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,400
So like, I don't know.

339
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,460
I don't know.

340
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,700
Thank you for the super chat.

341
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,240
Thank you.

342
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,380
Thank you.

343
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:04,800
Anyway, oh yeah, I'll talk more about this after, after the game.

344
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,900
But I was thinking about moving, moving out of Canada.

345
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,500
Like, I was thinking about it today.

346
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,400
Obviously, it's like, I'm not just gonna fucking just suddenly leave the country.

347
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:21,480
But like, the doctor issue, the fucking doctor shortage, like, actually fucked me up.

348
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,940
Like, I was like, I can't, I was thinking about it.

349
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:36,880
I was like, I can't believe I had to choose between flying to America to see a doctor, or waiting six plus hours to, for a doctor to potentially see me.

350
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,060
So like, I, I, that was like my limit.

351
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,060
That was literally my limit.

352
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:48,820
So I was like, oh my god, because it doesn't matter about the money to see a doctor.

353
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,680
They still won't see me, because we don't have enough doctors.

354
00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:02,200
Because apparently, um, a lot of doctors here in the West Coast, they like, they just leave, or they don't do their practice, they don't practice medicine here.

355
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:10,480
Like, I just, so that's why I was like, people were like, oh, but in the next few years, it'll be different.

356
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,020
Because like, goodbye Trudeau.

357
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,720
But, but like, how would you know?

358
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,960
I can't take a chance on maybe it'll be different.

359
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,480
Like, I can't take that chance.

360
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,700
How would we know?

361
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:33,300
Like, I have to wait like maybe five plus years to see if it actually changes.

362
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,080
So, so like, because it's not gonna change right away, guys.

363
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,760
Like, it's not gonna change right away.

364
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:55,260
Like, it's not like, like Trudeau's gone and then Trudeau just be like, by the way, here's like all the doctors you've ever wanted.

365
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,880
It doesn't happen in a year.

366
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:07,160
I don't even know when, when, when it's gonna come to us.

367
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:22,460
So, that's why I was like, I was like, he was, he kept all the doctors locked up in the East Coast and now, now that he leaves, they're free now.

368
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,540
Now, they can come back to West Coast.

369
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,660
He locked them all on East Coast.

370
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,100
That's why we didn't have any doctors.

371
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,460
But yeah, like obviously, like I'm not gonna suddenly move out.

372
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:52,640
I started thinking about it like today because I was like talking to my Canadian friends and we were like, oh my god, it's terrible.

373
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:04,280
I was like thinking about it because I was just like, but obviously I can't, I also have to renew my passport too.

374
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:16,740
My passport expires next month and I was like Googling how to renew my passport because the last time I, I'm a very sheltered child, but last time I, I, what about East Coast?

375
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,240
I will never touch, I'm sorry.

376
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,260
I've always been a West Coast child.

377
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,000
I will never cross the line.

378
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,280
West Coast, best coast.

379
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,280
What the fuck she ate?

380
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,600
No, it's not that.

381
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,720
It's just the fact that like, I'll always be a West Coast, a West Coast child.

382
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:46,600
I'm okay with visiting East Coast, but I can't, I can't, I can't leave.

383
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,080
Leave the West.

384
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:57,060
I can't guys, I've been raised up with West Coast ping.

385
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,180
This is why you don't deserve the doctors.

386
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,100
This is why all the doctors are on the East instead of the West.

387
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,000
But yes, anyway, so, so, oh my gosh, where was I?

388
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,140
You say why you have no doctors.

389
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:33,180
But I was just like trying to, I was trying to figure out like what to basically like, what to like, basically like what to do because I'm like, how the fuck do you get a passport renewed?

390
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:41,340
And you guys didn't know apparently there's the strike that's still going on the Canadian post-strike.

391
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,540
This is like, this is how fucked up our country is right now.

392
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,540
We don't, we can't receive mail.

393
00:24:52,300 --> 00:25:05,280
And like the recent updates is that, um, based, it's like if your US post office fucking closed down, so like update in Canada are, they're still on strike.

394
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:22,820
So we still can't receive mail right now and like so and then apparently we might not even get mail back until 2025 because it's already passed the deadline for like Christmas packages.

395
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:34,300
Because if you ever ship things to receive things in time for Christmas, there's a specific day for like when you should send out your packages so you can receive them in time for Christmas.

396
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,980
We're past the deadline now.

397
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:48,860
So people who sent via Canadian post can't receive their Christmas presents because of it.

398
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:58,580
Yeah, so because of that, there's like issues with passports too.

399
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:09,440
So a lot of people have to, for us in Canada, to renew your passport.

400
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,240
We either do it by mail, which is not an option anymore, or we do it like pickup.

401
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:27,320
So like it's even harder to get your passport renewed, which scares me because like my passport expires, um, next month.

402
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,180
Um, but it's like before, it's like after the concert.

403
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,260
So that's the best part.

404
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,780
It's after the concert, but it's still scares me though.

405
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,520
Because we have to do like pickup.

406
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,040
So instead we don't have the mail option.

407
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,120
So I have to go there in person, but I was reading it up and you can't book appointments.

408
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,300
You have to get lucky.

409
00:26:52,800 --> 00:27:04,940
Like that's, you have to get lucky to be able to renew your passport in like person without an appointment because all appointments are fully booked.

410
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:20,140
So you have to arrive there at like, at like at opening hours and just like make sure to God that they let you get it done today and you can wait until like hours just to be sure.

411
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,460
It's a passport.

412
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,520
Gotcha.

413
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,940
But it's even worse though.

414
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:33,840
It's even worse because we can't have mail in option and because we don't have mail in option.

415
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,860
There's gonna be a lot of people that's gonna be there to pick up their passport.

416
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,120
So it's gonna be more people that's trying to pick it up.

417
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,820
There's no online scheduling.

418
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,920
Every appointment option is fully booked months in advance.

419
00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:00,480
So you have to go there like and gotcha and see if you can get your passport renewed.

420
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,920
So I'm gonna do that on like a Monday or something.

421
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:16,300
So that's another reason why, bro like, if Canada Post goes on strike again, I can't.

422
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:28,400
Like I can't believe it got so bad that like when people are even gonna get Christmas presents.

423
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,860
Like what the fuck?

424
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,360
I can't believe we're at that point.

425
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:39,100
They chose like the perfect time to go on strike, but they still haven't got their way yet.

426
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,800
I can't believe we're still arguing with Canada Post.

427
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,260
Why are we still arguing with them?

428
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,920
It's been a fucking month plus now.

429
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,890
Sorry kids.

430
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,950
No, sorry kids.

431
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,850
Santa Elza went on strike.

432
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,070
It's not just West Coast.

433
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,790
It's the entire Canada.

434
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,710
You can't blame West Coast for this.

435
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,950
All of Canada is suffering.

436
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,190
It's not our fault.

437
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,330
This time.

438
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,450
This time it's not our fault.

439
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:28,070
Um, anyway Maco, thank you for the super chat.

440
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,250
Thank you, thank you.

Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

450
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,530
All right, let's actually play the game.

451
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:53,390
Uh, next scene.

452
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,350
Thank you, MagentaSoup.

453
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,590
Ah, thank you, thank you.

454
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,970
West coast, best coast.

455
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,770
So true, exactly.

456
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,450
West coast, best coast.

457
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,630
All right.

458
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,410
Um, all right, sniping time.

459
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:07,970
Whoa.

460
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,310
Oh, this... this is a different Hertz.

461
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,750
I can... oh, I can tell already.

462
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,790
Okay, give me a...

463
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,190
Give me a sec.

464
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,870
This game is definitely a different Hertz.

465
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,330
From my monitor.

466
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,390
All right.

467
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,850
I need to like close all my tabs related to the passport stuff.

468
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,330
So I can google this again.

469
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,430
I have like 16 tabs open regarding how...

470
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,890
And then I have a tab open about Stephen Harper.

471
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,210
Because I was like, how did he do it?

472
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,400
I was like, oh, if only we knew.

473
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,800
If only we knew.

474
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,820
Like, I'm missing.

475
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:03,680
Dear Mr. Harper, at least like we never had a can of post-strike.

476
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,660
Wasn't that years ago?

477
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:14,760
Okay.

478
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,120
All right.

479
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,340
Let's see.

480
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,320
We're on headphones.

481
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,160
Wait, do we do full range?

482
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,600
What is this?

483
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,600
Do we do?

484
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,820
But only if we met everybody.

485
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,440
If only we knew.

486
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,060
Okay.

487
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,400
Full range speakers.

488
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,900
Guys, this is how like sad I was today.

489
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,300
I literally looked up Stephen Harper.

490
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,240
Because I was sad.

491
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,040
Because I was like, how do we- How do we do it?

492
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,700
All right.

493
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,160
Oh, yes.

494
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:58,700
Wait, no.

495
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,520
Of course we want the kill camera.

496
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:03,720
All right.

497
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,140
Let's see options.

498
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,440
All right.

499
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,600
Let's see.

500
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,900
Ultra, low, medium.

501
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,280
Okay, we need medium.

502
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,300
Medium.

503
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,840
Oh my god.

504
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,920
What the fuck?

505
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,600
Okay, we gotta figure this out.

506
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:33,980
At least- Yeah, at least- At least Canada Post like worked under- I had doctors back then.

507
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:41,220
That's like my- I just was like, I never had an issue with doctors back then.

508
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,860
Uh, putting music down for now.

509
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,360
Okay.

510
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,810
There we go.

511
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,280
All right, cinematic.

512
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,660
Let's see.

513
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,640
Uh, we don't want motion blur, guys.

514
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,180
We don't want motion blur.

515
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,300
Um, so we gotta figure- Okay, low?

516
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,020
That'll work out.

517
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,300
Wait, is it already low?

518
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,120
Uh...

519
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,580
Oh, wait.

520
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,160
Why isn't motion blur on?

521
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,400
Okay, we don't need that.

522
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,860
What the fuck?

523
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,460
Why is this- Oh...

524
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,680
Display setup.

525
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,380
Okay, we got this correct.

526
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,600
Apply this resolution.

527
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:28,820
Uh...

528
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,260
Tutorial, yes.

529
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,800
Empty lung zoom.

530
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,940
Oh, yes.

531
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,780
I don't see those lungs.

532
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,740
Yeah, motion blur is so gross.

533
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,860
I hate motion blur.

534
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,380
Um...

535
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,400
I don't know.

536
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,860
What else do we have to fix, guys?

537
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:45,940
Advanced option?

538
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,240
Is there an advanced option?

539
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,000
Is that the one I'm looking at?

540
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,940
Oh, advanced option.

541
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,560
There we go.

542
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,320
Oh, we're not using- Reduce input mouse lag.

543
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,300
We don't want that.

544
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,220
Uh...

545
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,320
Okay.

546
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,380
Oh, shit.

547
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:03,620
No.

548
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,580
Whoa, wait.

549
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,460
No, wait.

550
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,460
How did ultra graphics made it?

551
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,200
Hahaha!

552
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,440
Whoops.

553
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,380
Okay, there we go.

554
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,840
I was gonna say, how did ultra graphics made it?

555
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,660
Ultra graphics improved myself.

556
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,540
Hahaha!

557
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:16,660
Alright.

558
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,340
Toki no.

559
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:18,860
Okay, guys.

560
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,660
What do we change?

561
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,140
What do we change, guys?

562
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,400
Wait, is aim assist on?

563
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,540
Or is it my- Are you talking about aimbot?

564
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,710
What do we want?

565
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:36,530
Yeah, don't worry.

566
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,190
We fixed it.

567
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:38,290
Shadow.

568
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,050
Shadow.

569
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,190
Oh my god.

570
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,670
Why is it like- Wait.

571
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:42,570
Okay, there we go.

572
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,810
Where the fuck is low?

573
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,870
Okay, shadow reflection detail.

574
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,270
Um, low, low.

575
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:51,770
This is good.

576
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:55,310
I don't know if this is good, because like, I'm still lagging a little bit.

577
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,970
Just a little bit though.

578
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,930
Um, but still, it's not great.

579
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,290
Ah, I know that hurts is different too.

580
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:05,610
When I tab out- When I tab out, it's like, different.

581
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,690
It's like, I- It like- Like, lags a little.

582
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:16,870
So, I know the- I know the thing, um- The hurts for this is different from the game from my monitor.

583
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,790
Okay, let's see.

584
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,190
Gotta make sure.

585
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,270
Uh, okay.

586
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,310
I'm tabbing back in.

587
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,530
I'm tabbing back in.

588
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,150
Uh, v-sync is- No.

589
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,730
Do we turn v-sync on, guys?

590
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,490
Do we turn v-sync on?

591
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,110
Oh, it will only make it when we restart the game?

592
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,270
Okay, we'll restart the game.

593
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,090
Okay, we'll restart the game too.

594
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,510
And see if it- Uh, yeah, okay.

595
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,530
We'll restart the game.

596
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,310
Let's turn aim assist off.

597
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,770
And then we'll restart.

598
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:58,450
Alright.

599
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,890
Give us a sec, we're just gonna restart.

600
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:05,490
Alright, before we go into our favorite mission- I've never done the mission before.

601
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,810
I've never done it- I've never played Sniper Relief before.

602
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,730
But we all know about the mission.

603
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:22,310
We all know about the beautiful- The mission that everybody knows.

604
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,750
But I've never played Sniper Relief before.

605
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:37,010
I thought it'd be like- You know, I thought it'd be like a good- A good way to celebrate Thanksgiving in general.

606
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:40,450
I mean, I feel like it is a great way to celebrate Thanksgiving.

607
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,790
Um, you know, just to be like- Because it's American Thanksgiving.

608
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:51,330
I don't even know- If you guys don't know, Canadians already celebrated Canadian Thanksgiving like two months ago.

609
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:58,950
So this is like nothing to- So it's just a regular- This is just a regular Thursday to us.

610
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:04,950
But in celebration of, yay, America, I think- Oh yeah, the fake one.

611
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,730
Oh yeah, sorry.

612
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:10,550
Even though our country is like in flames right now.

613
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,050
Doesn't make us less of a country.

614
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:18,830
In fact, I'd say it makes us more of a country that we're like not doing okay.

615
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:31,450
I just feel like us going in flames might mean- If anything, we're more of a country now.

616
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,870
All right.

617
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,210
All right, let's see.

618
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,610
Oh, it's so weird.

619
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:46,170
It's so like- Um, I mean, it's all right.

620
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,890
But it obviously could be improved.

621
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,390
How low can I go?

622
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,030
How much lower can I go?

623
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,830
No, I'm not.

624
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,590
The doctor shit was actually my breaking point.

625
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:04,710
So I am not- Like, legitimately, I'm thinking about moving out of Canada because of the doctors.

626
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:05,690
I'm not okay.

627
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,170
How low can I go?

628
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,330
Too much background stuff is happening.

629
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,290
Oh, yeah, no, I won't be surprised.

630
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,310
All right, let me close more tabs.

631
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,410
Let me close my more- The Doki Bird experience.

632
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:35,190
We're gonna- We'll get to the game soon, guys.

633
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:41,790
We'll get to- Don't worry, I'm closing tabs, guys.

634
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:45,650
I'm doing the bear- I'm closing tabs, guys.

635
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,810
I'm- I'm doing it.

636
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,770
Okay, I'm gonna save this one.

637
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,890
I'm gonna save this link.

638
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,650
And then, I feel like I've closed enough tabs, though.

639
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,230
I think that's enough tabs to close.

640
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,310
That should be enough, right?

641
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,270
All right.

642
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,370
Here we go.

643
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,570
All right.

644
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:15,130
No, I can't close my- All my tabs, because, like, I have to see where- Um, oh, hey, it's better.

645
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,350
Wow, who would have thought?

646
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,150
Guys, I think I had too many tabs.

647
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:26,770
Guys, I think- Guys, I think I had too many tabs.

648
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:35,710
All right, let's- Let's do- Prepare for a realistic- Bullet- Ballistic- Deadly- Friendly- Fire- Simplified- You know what?

649
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,470
Let's do hard.

650
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,610
It can't be that difficult, right?

651
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,110
Okay, aggression.

652
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:41,730
Normal.

653
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,290
Okay, let's stick, like, hard.

654
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,010
And then- It can't be that difficult.

655
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:48,990
We gotta learn.

656
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,510
We gotta learn how to play this game.

657
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:56,210
So, default, fine, t-pose, special.

658
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:01,270
Which was a good- I feel like fine, t-pose, wide.

659
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:02,710
What's the default?

660
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,750
Default reticle.

661
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,290
Fine crosshair.

662
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,310
I feel like default.

663
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:14,070
Um, and then- What's a good gun?

664
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,810
What do I have?

665
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,750
We have the springfield, guys.

666
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,690
Okay, and then- This one has less damage.

667
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,790
What's the difference between that?

668
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,510
Oh, the rate of fire.

669
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,410
The carbine.

670
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,650
Wait, the carbine seems good.

671
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:35,570
Um...

672
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,190
Springfield is decent.

673
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:38,770
Oh, the other guns.

674
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,810
I have other guns.

675
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,730
I have the Rosmarc.

676
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:42,570
Rosmarc.

677
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,690
I have the Winchester 1895.

678
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,330
Whoa!

679
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,250
Wait, maybe this one?

680
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,690
Look, it has more green.

681
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:52,110
Uh, it has more green.

682
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,070
Why do you care about what he looks like?

683
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,930
You should care about what I look like.

684
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,130
LOL

685
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:05,370
Why are you caring about what he fucking looks like, guys?

686
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:06,910
All right, guys.

687
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,410
What do we get?

688
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:11,030
The- Okay, but like...

689
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,550
This has more green, though.

690
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,610
It's not the Winchester.

691
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,650
It's the Winches- But slower rate.

692
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,290
No, the rate of fire is higher.

693
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:21,150
The rate of fire is higher, though.

694
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,950
It's just a muzzle.

695
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,410
Okay, I'm gonna get this.

696
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,870
Okay, what gun can I do here?

697
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,530
The grease gun.

698
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,810
Ooh, the shotgun.

699
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,350
I feel like if anything I should...

700
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:34,810
Let's see...

701
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,710
Maybe this one?

702
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:38,690
And then...

703
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:39,850
Well rod.

704
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:40,650
Suppressed.

705
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:41,830
Oh, they're all suppressed.

706
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,330
Maybe I should get all... Ooh.

707
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,490
Okay, damage, but the rate of fire is high.

708
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,870
Ooh, there's a...

709
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,850
Revolver, but it's not suppressed though.

710
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,230
Maybe this one?

711
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:56,010
PPSH?

712
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,710
The fuck is a PPSH?

713
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,290
Oh, Pish?

714
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,890
Pish 41?

715
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:02,990
Is the Pish 41 that good?

716
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:03,990
All right.

717
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,450
I'll get the Pish 41.

718
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,490
I believe in you guys.

719
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:09,830
The P- the PP.

720
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,070
All right.

721
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,970
The revolver is cooler.

722
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,170
Okay, all right.

723
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,370
Do I have any skills?

724
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,450
No, I'm just starting.

725
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:20,990
All right.

726
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,590
Can't be that bad, right?

727
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,330
Okay, I got default skin, mastery skin.

728
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,090
Wait, what's this?

729
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,470
Oh, camouflage!

730
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,110
They can't see me!

731
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:32,190
Okay, but to be fair, like, it's AI.

732
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:33,850
I feel like AI can see me.

733
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:36,110
I feel- Wait, I have explosives.

734
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:36,970
I have stick grenades.

735
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,470
What else do I need?

736
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,550
I'm not skilled enough, guys.

737
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:44,350
I don't have enough tokens to unlock these.

738
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:47,910
Okay, I have stick grenades and med- All right, we're going in.

739
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:50,990
We're going in!

740
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,750
We can snipe.

741
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,290
Can't be that bad.

742
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:03,230
It took 45 minutes to start a game, but that's okay.

743
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:05,750
We'll learn.

744
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,210
We can learn.

745
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:18,350
I have popcorn too, so it's like an actual movie.

746
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:24,890
Let's go, Winston!

747
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,330
I know you were incarnated into a monkey!

748
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,150
Oh, shit!

749
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:33,290
The screen just cut off!

750
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:33,710
Whoops!

751
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,310
I forgot about that!

752
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,030
Oh, I forgot!

753
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,390
The piglet!

754
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,210
That makes sense.

755
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:44,630
Whoops!

756
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:46,890
Okay, you guys can read the subtitles.

757
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,070
It's like, what?

758
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:51,450
History!

759
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,420
Italia!

760
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,700
Okay.

761
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,560
Okay.

762
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,840
That was a great movie.

763
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,860
I watched Wicked.

764
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,640
This was an improvement.

765
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,520
Wicked fans, please don't hurt me.

766
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,700
I watched it in 3D, so like, I was not enjoying it as much.

767
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,920
I raised the volume up a little.

768
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,460
I watched it in 3D.

769
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,500
I think I would have actually liked the movie more if I didn't watch it in 3D.

770
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,340
I was eating popcorn.

771
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,280
I have like, caramel popcorn, like sea salt and caramel popcorn on my desk.

772
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,060
Alright.

773
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,740
Let's see.

774
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,480
How do we resume?

775
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,400
Restart.

776
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:50,860
Resume.

777
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:51,960
All right, here we go.

778
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:57,480
British intelligence thinks the Luftwaffe's presence on San Cellini might explain why.

779
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,680
The Royal Navy dispatched a captured Italian freighter, the Orchidea.

780
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,620
to investigate.

781
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,620
She was equipped with the very latest radio interception equipment.

782
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,300
The intelligence she gathered confirmed our worst fears.

783
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,140
I thought it'd be different.

784
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,840
I haven't watched a movie in the theater for like, four plus years.

785
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,940
So I thought it'd be different.

786
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,240
Survivors from the destroyed ships have talked about a new kind of missile.

787
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,640
Radio controlled from the plane that launched them.

788
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,520
These rockets can track our ships with lethal accuracy.

789
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:37,440
The Orchidea's job was to monitor Luftwaffe radio transmissions and find out what the Germans are up to.

790
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,640
Cookie sounds manly?

791
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,120
Thanks.

792
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,320
I shot that guy's ball and that took his testosterone.

793
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:48,540
Every ball I shoot, I go stronger.

794
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:57,670
Now we need to know what the Nazis are planning and how we can stop them.

795
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:04,710
A member of the Luftwaffe's top brass is a young man, General Tobias Schmidt.

796
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:07,670
It's no secret Hitler thinks highly of him.

797
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:13,990
Schmidt would never let himself be taken alive.

798
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,910
He'd never betray his beloved crew.

799
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:20,430
But he might just be carrying some information with him.

800
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:21,550
There he goes, gotta practice.

801
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:24,430
Gotta practice before we get to the big one.

802
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:26,530
The one big one.

803
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,430
We gotta practice!

804
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:42,050
Guys, we have to practice before we get to the biggest heist of all time.

805
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:45,830
I need to find out all I can about the new rocket.

806
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:48,150
The testy bandito!

807
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:51,650
You failed.

808
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:54,070
You failed in NNN.

809
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:58,190
If you fail NNN, this is what happens.

810
00:46:58,750 --> 00:46:59,430
Remember.

811
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:04,750
The Toki will come get you.

812
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:08,350
That's right.

813
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,190
You shouldn't fail.

814
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,750
You shouldn't have failed it.

815
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:17,930
Alright, 25, 20, and 7.

816
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:21,450
The Toki is here to enforce.

817
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,390
It's still November!

818
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,310
It's still November!

819
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:29,390
I'm the nut hunter.

820
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,050
Alright, let's see.

821
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,450
Turn down the overall.

822
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:33,950
Okay, we'll turn it here.

823
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:35,550
Alright.

824
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:39,390
Woah, it still has sensitivities really high.

825
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:40,310
Let me turn that down.

826
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:42,970
Guys.

827
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:48,090
This is a warning to everyone.

828
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:49,970
It's still November.

829
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,770
How the fuck do I get my gun out?

830
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,050
Give me a sec.

831
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:00,110
I gotta learn how to take my gun out of the holster.

832
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:02,810
Does it teach you?

833
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:03,170
Okay.

834
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:06,310
Okay, E.

835
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,870
Alright!

836
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:08,350
No!

837
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:10,510
I was almost there.

838
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:12,250
I got the stupid lungs.

839
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,750
Oh, use binoculars?

840
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:20,910
Oh, tag the enemies?

841
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:21,830
Okay.

842
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:23,290
You're next.

843
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:25,590
Okay.

844
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,930
Okay, we used the binoculars.

845
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,230
What I just did?

846
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:33,110
Is there another guy?

847
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:34,690
Who's hiding from me?

848
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,310
Anybody hiding from me?

849
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:39,890
Oh, and the pulley.

850
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:40,830
Oh, okay.

851
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:42,610
Alright.

852
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:47,410
Oh, you guys are so lucky you have the wall.

853
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:52,470
You're so lucky.

854
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:56,170
Fucking, I don't need that shit.

855
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:01,970
That's fucking rare.

856
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:05,610
You're lucky the wall is protecting you right now.

857
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:10,630
So lucky.

858
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:13,090
Okay, is there anybody?

859
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:15,050
Anybody here?

860
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:16,050
No?

861
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:18,370
Oh my gosh, I need to practice.

862
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,210
Oh, jump the gap?

863
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,070
Oh, that's easy.

864
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,850
Alright, I'm coming for you.

865
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,650
November's not over yet.

866
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:32,590
No, no.

867
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,990
November's not over yet.

868
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:36,550
I'm heading over.

869
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:38,390
No, I see.

870
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:40,230
Thank you for the super chat.

871
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:41,570
Thank you, thank you.

872
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:43,050
You can't fail.

873
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:45,650
And then the nuts are gone.

874
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:48,670
Everyone run!

875
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,510
Okay, what do they have?

876
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:54,910
What do you have?

877
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:57,710
It's the adder.

878
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:01,970
Oh, wait, no.

879
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:02,810
Give me a sec.

880
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,350
I need to search your body first.

881
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,270
I need to search your body.

882
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:11,610
Okay.

883
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:13,830
Can I pick these guns?

884
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:16,810
Oh, I gotta swap my- No, my gun is already perfect.

885
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:18,510
Okay.

886
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:21,650
Alright, off you go.

887
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:23,710
You know what you did.

888
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:28,950
Wait, no, you don't get like the- Oh, he is not okay.

889
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,930
She can't- Goodbye!

890
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:37,310
Alright, get over here.

891
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:42,270
When you failed the challenge, the ocean must take you now.

892
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:43,470
Goodbye!

893
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:46,810
There you go.

894
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,270
See, everything is okay.

895
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,010
I'll make sure like there's nobody here.

896
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:53,970
Alright, up we go.

897
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:57,970
Is anybody up here?

898
00:50:57,970 --> 00:50:59,990
No, okay.

899
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:05,290
Where are they?

900
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:06,790
There's nobody here, sir.

901
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:12,470
That's fucked up.

902
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,110
Shouldn't have failed.

903
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,410
You had- It was only 30 days.

904
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:26,590
You could have- You could have survived 30 days.

905
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:30,450
I need to make sure those propaganda cameras are destroyed.

906
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,510
Can't have the Nazis spreading their poison.

907
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:34,730
This one?

908
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:35,910
Okay, okay.

909
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:37,910
This is destroyed camera.

910
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:40,370
Kill officers by any means.

911
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,710
Okay, so I have to kill all of these guys.

912
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:43,130
Okay.

913
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:46,170
Only?

914
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:54,950
Look, if the monks can do it, so can you.

915
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:58,730
Rest in peace to my nuts.

916
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:02,430
Thank you for the superchat.

917
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:03,790
Thank you, thank you.

918
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:06,430
Return show tutorial.

919
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:09,090
The fuck does that mean?

920
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:12,610
Alright, I ain't-

921
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:21,330
If I had to leave the world, this is the way I have to go.

922
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:22,150
No, not yet.

923
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:23,570
You haven't seen the real way.

924
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:27,190
You haven't seen the actual way you must go.

925
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,780
Is that a camera over there?

926
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,900
No, that's not it.

927
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,140
Okay, if I shoot them, will they know I'm here?

928
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,370
Okay, if I shoot them from here...

929
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,610
Will they know?

930
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:57,250
Oh shit, what's this?

931
00:52:58,090 --> 00:52:59,370
No, that's less damage.

932
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,290
Will they know if I shoot them from here?

933
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:07,770
No, they won't.

934
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,340
No, they won't.

935
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:11,940
Will they?

936
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,080
Right here.

937
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:26,960
Noises and non-lethal shots can help the enemy triangulate your location.

938
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,400
If this happens too much or the enemy gets a visual- I MISSED!

939
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:37,970
Whereas a ghost image will appear in the environment.

940
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:39,010
Are useful tools showing?

941
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:40,550
How did I miss?

942
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,390
God, this is why I needed to practice.

943
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:44,750
I got a man down.

944
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,150
Oh, he can't move.

945
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,230
I didn't miss.

946
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:49,250
Oh, I didn't miss.

947
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:50,390
You get this though.

948
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:52,750
Wait, how did I miss that?

949
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:55,670
Okay.

950
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:02,290
That has to be a- How is that not a hit?

951
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:03,870
Does he know?

952
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,210
There's no way he knows.

953
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:06,850
There's no way.

954
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,030
There's no way- Oh my god, he knows.

955
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:12,110
THERE'S- OH SHIT!

956
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:13,890
THERE'S BULLET DROP!

957
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:17,890
GUYS, DID YOU GUYS KNOW- DID YOU GUYS KNOW THERE'S BULLET DROP?

958
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:21,950
What's the bullet drop?

959
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:22,530
Right here?

960
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:24,910
WHAT IS THE BULLET DROP?

961
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:28,350
Oh my god, I don't know what the bullet drop is.

962
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:29,430
I don't know.

963
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:34,790
I don't- I- I don't know.

964
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:37,110
I don't know what the bullet drop is.

965
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:39,750
Where is it?

966
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:40,330
Is it here?

967
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:43,610
It's-

968
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:48,850
It's too real.

969
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:53,010
HOW IS THAT NOT HIT?

970
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:58,690
THERE'S WINDS!

971
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:00,570
There's wind.

972
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:02,730
Oh my god.

973
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:04,890
WHAT'S THE WIND?

974
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:07,230
Okay.

975
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,930
I figured out the wind.

976
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:14,090
I figured out the wind.

977
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:18,030
I- I- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

978
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:20,690
I figured out the wind.

979
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:25,770
I- Oh my god.

980
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,650
We figured it out.

981
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:32,010
We figured out the wind shot.

982
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,370
Oh my god.

983
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:38,030
There we go.

984
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:40,530
The fucking wind.

985
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:47,590
Okay, that's fine.

986
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,020
There we go.

987
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,420
There we go.

988
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:03,010
Oh my god, where did I shot that?

989
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:05,930
Nice.

990
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:06,210
Nice.

991
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:09,010
There we go.

992
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,930
It was worth it.

993
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:14,390
OH SHIT!

994
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,170
There we go.

995
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:19,910
That's fine.

996
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:21,690
I didn't see that guy.

997
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:23,970
It's fine.

998
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:26,750
Where's the last guy?

999
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,450
He's gonna regret that.

1000
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:30,830
He's gonna regret that!

1001
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:32,370
Oh!

1002
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:34,750
Headshot.

1003
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:36,050
There we go.

1004
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:37,490
I figured out the lungs.

1005
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,550
I figured it out.

1006
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,710
There we go, guys.

1007
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:44,450
I figured it out, everybody.

1008
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:46,450
It took us like...

1009
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:47,690
Trial and error.

1010
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:51,210
But I accounted for bullet drop and the stupid wind.

1011
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:56,550
Oh fuck!

1012
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:56,990
Oh!

1013
00:56:58,110 --> 00:56:59,290
Give me a sec!

1014
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,750
I wasn't looking at the map!

1015
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:03,450
No!

1016
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:08,090
I didn't look at the map!

1017
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:11,350
I downloaded the wind!

1018
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:13,330
But it didn't matter.

1019
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,730
It didn't matter.

1020
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:18,290
I didn't realize there were people in the tunnel.

1021
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:21,510
Alright.

1022
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:25,330
Okay, bring down...

1023
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,450
Sound effects a little bit.

1024
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,430
Okay, I'll bring that down.

1025
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:33,090
Sound effects...

1026
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:33,990
And then...

1027
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:35,250
Huh?

1028
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:38,530
Okay, there we go.

1029
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:40,730
Don't worry.

1030
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:41,530
I figured...

1031
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:42,210
Oh shit.

1032
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:44,150
There we go.

1033
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:46,210
See, look at that.

1034
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:48,810
There we go, look at that.

1035
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:49,930
Wait, you're still alive?

1036
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:50,670
There we go.

1037
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:53,130
Easy.

1038
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,070
Fucking easy.

1039
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:59,270
There we go.

1040
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:01,230
I told you, it's so easy.

1041
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:04,030
You'll never know.

1042
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:06,450
I don't need the assignment.

1043
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:07,770
Alright.

1044
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,050
We gotta practice.

1045
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:10,310
We gotta still practice.

1046
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:12,430
Don't worry.

1047
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,630
We can still practice.

1048
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:17,030
I mean, this was...

1049
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:17,930
Look!

1050
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:20,590
I didn't realize the wind existed!

1051
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:21,310
I forgot!

1052
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:23,570
Guys...

1053
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:26,890
All the practice I had was simulation.

1054
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:30,250
I didn't realize the wind existed.

1055
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:33,170
How do I show tutorial?

1056
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:36,090
Give me my tutorial back!

1057
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:37,730
Where did it go?

1058
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:40,550
Alright, now...

1059
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:41,650
Now it's easy.

1060
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:43,710
I discovered the wind.

1061
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:46,170
Oh my god, they don't know I'm here.

1062
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:47,970
There's no way they know I'm here.

1063
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:51,470
There's no way.

1064
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:53,970
There he is.

1065
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:58,610
How did they know?

1066
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:03,090
How did they know?

1067
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:05,530
How did he know?

1068
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:08,930
That's fucking right.

1069
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:10,270
Oh shit!

1070
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:12,630
Sorry.

1071
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:13,750
I left him.

1072
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:15,430
Now I have time.

1073
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:18,230
There we go.

1074
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:19,830
I still have time.

1075
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,530
What the fuck?

1076
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:21,990
Who shot me?

1077
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:23,570
Who shot me?

1078
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:25,590
Wait, behind me.

1079
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:28,950
Oh my god, behind me.

1080
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:29,910
How do I heal?

1081
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:31,370
How did I heal?

1082
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:33,390
How did I heal?

1083
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,760
Guys, how do I heal?

1084
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,260
I lost my tutorial.

1085
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:43,440
Where is he?

1086
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,500
Where is he?

1087
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:48,440
There's so many people.

1088
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,540
I'm a little...

1089
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,320
They know I'm here.

1090
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,840
How do I use my medkit, guys?

1091
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:57,660
Just walk.

1092
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,160
You're right, I can just walk it off.

1093
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,440
There's so many people.

1094
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,160
This is bad.

1095
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,860
This is a little bad.

1096
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:08,400
This is really bad.

1097
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,260
Oh, I shot him in the liver though.

1098
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:16,960
I don't know how to use my medkit.

1099
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,480
I'm back here!

1100
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,500
Oh, I...

1101
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,020
My sniper was way too loud.

1102
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,640
I gotta run.

1103
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,300
Okay.

1104
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,340
Maybe they'll have stuff for me.

1105
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:35,900
Okay, I gotta keep running.

1106
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,440
I gotta keep running.

1107
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,320
No, it's okay.

1108
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:42,840
It's okay.

1109
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,180
I was fucking around way too much.

1110
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:48,960
If I just hide, they won't know I'm here.

1111
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,780
They won't know I'm here.

1112
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,860
How would they know I'm here?

1113
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,940
How would they know?

1114
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,120
See, they don't know.

1115
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,240
They're so confused.

1116
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:12,810
Like, where are they going?

1117
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:17,690
They don't know.

1118
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:19,290
I'm safe.

1119
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:21,870
They're so stupid.

1120
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:23,810
Look at that.

1121
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:25,570
I'm stealthing, guys.

1122
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,800
Run, run, run.

1123
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,140
Stay in this bush.

1124
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:35,740
They don't know.

1125
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,020
They don't know.

1126
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,580
I'm part of the foolish.

1127
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,500
I'm part of it.

1128
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,500
See?

1129
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,560
Oh, I'm safe!

1130
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,020
I'm so safe.

1131
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:52,640
Look at that.

1132
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:53,280
I did it.

1133
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,620
I'm pressing return, but it won't give me my tutorial back.

1134
01:01:58,820 --> 01:01:59,540
Please.

1135
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,080
I just want my tutorial back.

1136
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,380
Where did it go?

1137
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:07,020
Okay.

1138
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,720
Where did my tutorial go?

1139
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,360
Okay, we're gonna have to...

1140
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,280
We have to go here.

1141
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:16,780
Alright.

1142
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,460
My bush worked.

1143
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:24,800
Okay.

1144
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:25,620
Guys, don't worry.

1145
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,560
My bush worked.

1146
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,160
I still don't know how to heal.

1147
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:32,360
Okay.

1148
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:34,260
See?

1149
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,300
They said I'm dead.

1150
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:38,220
Is there anything over here?

1151
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:40,760
What's that?

1152
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,360
There's something over here.

1153
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,860
That might be a good thing.

1154
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:52,640
Alright.

1155
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:01,410
Did I do it?

1156
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:10,660
That's you.

1157
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:19,210
That's what happens if you fail November.

1158
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:22,730
That's right.

1159
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:25,370
This is my message to all of you.

1160
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:27,550
You have three more days.

1161
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:28,890
This is...

1162
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:37,370
You have three more days.

1163
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:41,950
Let's go.

1164
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:43,010
No.

1165
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:45,630
No nuts November.

1166
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,350
Three more days.

1167
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:50,990
Stay strong.

1168
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:55,190
Thank you for the super chat.

1169
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:59,690
Three more days.

1170
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:06,050
What are you gonna do?

1171
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:07,070
Pick him up?

1172
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:11,590
I'm gonna shoot him from here.

1173
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:12,790
Come on.

1174
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:16,590
Wait, what?

1175
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:17,690
From where?

1176
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,120
Oh, there he is.

1177
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:26,180
Okay.

1178
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:27,380
I gotta kill him though.

1179
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:29,800
There we go.

1180
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:31,700
That's right.

1181
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,180
Get over here.

1182
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,200
That's right.

1183
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:36,920
Yeah, that's right.

1184
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:39,160
Okay, we leave.

1185
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,840
We got what we wanted.

1186
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,380
We leave.

1187
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,380
We'll be fine.

1188
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,980
We will not be fine.

1189
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,820
We will not be fine.

1190
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,080
They won't know I'm down here though.

1191
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,600
They won't know.

1192
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,420
They won't know I'm here.

1193
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,560
We got the shot we wanted.

1194
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,440
We got the shot we wanted.

1195
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,080
That's all that matters.

1196
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,340
Three more days.

1197
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,100
Three more days.

1198
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:25,220
You guys can do it, guys.

1199
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,880
Three more days.

1200
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,780
Stay strong.

1201
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:29,700
Everybody.

1202
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,300
Okay, let's see.

1203
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,280
Turn down that.

1204
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,460
And then turn music down a little bit.

1205
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,200
No.

1206
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,040
Alright, we just gotta wait a little.

1207
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:47,960
But I'm weak.

1208
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:50,440
I'm weak.

1209
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,220
Three more days to fail three more times.

1210
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:58,800
Okay.

1211
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:01,420
There's no way.

1212
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,620
There's no way they go over here, right?

1213
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,100
A moment of silence for the Nesticles in the chat.

1214
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,720
And for the people who failed.

1215
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,000
What's wrong with you?

1216
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:13,460
What's wrong with me?

1217
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,360
Thank you for the super chat.

1218
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,460
Thank you.

1219
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:18,180
Alright.

1220
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,560
This is just practice.

1221
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:25,980
Okay, nice.

1222
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:27,520
See?

1223
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:28,080
Easy.

1224
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,220
It's not that bad.

1225
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:32,600
Okay, we gotta kill four officers over here.

1226
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:34,120
And then...

1227
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,820
Oh, we just gotta kill this guy.

1228
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,280
This is the most important guy.

1229
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:38,880
Okay.

1230
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,200
We need to find him.

1231
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:45,180
Nope, no you don't.

1232
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,980
I'm gonna go into hiding.

1233
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,760
Go into the gooner cave.

1234
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,080
Okay, what's this?

1235
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,100
Wait, what is this area?

1236
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,980
Is this like a hiding spot?

1237
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,340
What is this?

1238
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,860
Oh, it's like a little hiding spot.

1239
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:13,830
Is there anything here?

1240
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:17,110
Is there any extra loot here?

1241
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:20,190
Is this the cave?

1242
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:24,130
That cave can't save you.

1243
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:25,510
I found the cave.

1244
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:29,990
They're above me.

1245
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:32,890
Okay, we gotta go here.

1246
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:41,130
I hear them, but I don't know where they are.

1247
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:43,890
How do I get back up?

1248
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:47,210
Am I stuck here?

1249
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:49,510
How the fuck do I get outta here?

1250
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:54,810
Where's my pistol?

1251
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:59,670
Oh, there's a guy right here.

1252
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:03,130
There's a guy right here.

1253
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:06,970
Where did he go?

1254
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:10,250
He was literally right here.

1255
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:11,150
Where did he go?

1256
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:19,470
I literally saw him walking here.

1257
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:23,130
Wait, what?

1258
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:31,870
No, I swear there was a guy right in front of us.

1259
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:39,150
Oh my god, where is he?

1260
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:45,590
Okay, I gotta figure out how to get out of this fucking cave.

1261
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:46,590
This fucking area.

1262
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:51,400
What?

1263
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,740
Where the fuck?

1264
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:01,830
Nice.

1265
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,220
That's how you...

1266
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:08,780
He didn't fail, I just didn't like him.

1267
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:14,500
Welcome to the tomato farm.

1268
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:15,600
Welcome, welcome.

1269
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,840
I just didn't like him.

1270
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,740
He was wrong.

1271
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,100
Wrong time, wrong place.

1272
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:32,140
Maybe I can go up here?

1273
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:37,110
Is there anything here?

1274
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,870
No, it's just a cave.

1275
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:42,130
But what about...

1276
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:43,930
Cause look him in the eye and tell him...

1277
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,790
And then go for the shot.

1278
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:48,130
Thank you for the super chat.

1279
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:49,710
Thank you, thank you.

1280
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:52,850
Anybody here?

1281
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:55,530
Oh my god, I feel like...

1282
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:56,540
It's so paranoia.

1283
01:09:57,130 --> 01:09:58,590
Because I don't know where they are.

1284
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:00,370
Oh, he's here.

1285
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:07,080
Nice.

1286
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:10,820
The wind can't stop me.

1287
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,000
I'm too close for the wind.

1288
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,420
That's fucking right.

1289
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,140
Stupid wind.

1290
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,020
Who invented wind anyway?

1291
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,560
Can't stop me.

1292
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,960
That's right, give me your shit.

1293
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:32,320
Nobody will remember who you are.

1294
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,260
No one will remember you.

1295
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:37,880
Nobody.

1296
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:40,540
Get out.

1297
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,180
Oh, okay.

1298
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:42,400
I mean...

1299
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,340
Now you look very pretty on that rock.

1300
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:49,180
Suppressed ammo allow you to fire your weapon silently.

1301
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,080
Oh, wait.

1302
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,040
I can change it with the radical...

1303
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:53,480
Wait, how?

1304
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,040
How do I change it?

1305
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,780
You can't say that.

1306
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,040
I don't know how to change it.

1307
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,560
Okay, we're gonna...

1308
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,620
You can change...

1309
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:08,080
How do I change it?

1310
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:08,860
Alright.

1311
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,800
Scope, reload, shoulder aim.

1312
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,820
Shoulder aim, toggle, increase...

1313
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:16,160
I can increase the scope range?

1314
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:16,920
Okay.

1315
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:17,100
Okay.

1316
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:20,960
Traverse, pick up weapon, defuse.

1317
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:22,240
Q.

1318
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:23,840
Okay, it's Q.

1319
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:25,920
Radio, menu.

1320
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:26,880
Okay, Q.

1321
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,140
Toggle, select item, medkit.

1322
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,000
Okay, 6.

1323
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:32,980
Select...

1324
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:34,920
What the fuck am I gonna do with a rock?

1325
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:36,900
Alright, Q.

1326
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:40,080
Okay.

1327
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:41,860
Oh my god, I have rocks?

1328
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,460
Regular ammo.

1329
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,940
Do I even have suppressed?

1330
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,300
Oh, I do!

1331
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,060
Wait, I wasn't using suppressed this entire time?

1332
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:55,820
I can fucking throw a rock at somebody.

1333
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,720
Wait, where's the rock?

1334
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:06,490
How do I get the rock out?

1335
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:07,910
How do I?

1336
01:12:08,230 --> 01:12:10,090
Wait, how do I get the rock out?

1337
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:14,170
Select rock.

1338
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:15,230
Oh, it's 7.

1339
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:19,050
I put on my glasses, by the way.

1340
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:22,910
Wait, I don't have a rock.

1341
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:25,170
It's F?

1342
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:25,750
Oh!

1343
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:29,910
There we go, I figured it out.

1344
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,340
Yeah, I assume it is.

1345
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:37,860
Because it makes it so that...

1346
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:43,390
There we go.

1347
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:47,090
That's easy.

1348
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:48,810
That part is easy.

1349
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:56,690
Because they're so close, so I don't have to worry about...

1350
01:12:57,230 --> 01:12:58,050
Oh, what the fuck?

1351
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:03,050
No.

1352
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:06,310
Oh no, no, no!

1353
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:07,330
How are you still alive?

1354
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:10,250
Oh no, oh no, oh no, he's still alive!

1355
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:11,930
He's still alive!

1356
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:14,410
How are you still alive?

1357
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,140
No, we gotta run.

1358
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,600
We gotta run.

1359
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,940
And I didn't expect him to live.

1360
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,660
Okay, we got...

1361
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:27,520
I don't remember how to heal.

1362
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:28,960
Guys, which one was heal?

1363
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:30,700
I don't remember how to heal.

1364
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,720
Guys, I don't remember how to heal.

1365
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:40,960
Is it 6?

1366
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,100
It's not 6!

1367
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:47,640
I can't get my heals out!

1368
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,820
Oh my god, it's not 6.

1369
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,100
It won't let me heal.

1370
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,240
It won't let me heal!

1371
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:58,340
Please.

1372
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:00,400
Please, this is all I ask.

1373
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:06,110
Oh, 6 and then F.

1374
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:07,330
Oh, and then F, okay.

1375
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:10,190
Okay, I'm okay now.

1376
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:12,390
You know what?

1377
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:14,090
Fuck this one guy in particular, though.

1378
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,920
Oh, he can't move!

1379
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:27,860
Oh my god, I shot his spine!

1380
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,720
You think he's gonna help you?

1381
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:46,490
You can't walk!

1382
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:50,670
You had 3 days.

1383
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:53,070
You had 3 days.

1384
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:57,230
What the fuck?

1385
01:14:57,710 --> 01:14:58,910
He had 3 days.

1386
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:02,730
I'm going the wrong way.

1387
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:05,630
It's like, oh my god, it's all the way there?

1388
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:08,170
Alright, let's test out fall damage.

1389
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:11,410
Okay, the game won't let me test out fall.

1390
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:13,490
Even the game was like...

1391
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:15,990
It was like, we're not testing out fall.

1392
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:17,390
Oh, unless...

1393
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:17,790
Yeah!

1394
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:19,390
No fall damage!

1395
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:22,270
Let's go.

1396
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:26,850
Okay, we have to go this way and then across the bridge.

1397
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:29,170
There's a lot of people on that bridge!

1398
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:30,850
Woah, okay.

1399
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:34,870
Do we save?

1400
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:35,750
Oh yeah, we should.

1401
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:37,670
Oh, I didn't realize you can save.

1402
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:41,670
Okay, this is gonna be...

1403
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:46,590
Okay, I don't think this has anything to do with November anymore.

1404
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:48,610
You don't know that.

1405
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,420
Oh, I don't know what you're talking about.

1406
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:57,040
What do you mean?

1407
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,240
No?

1408
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:04,110
No?

1409
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:08,970
No, what are you talking about?

1410
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:12,730
I definitely heard something.

1411
01:16:12,830 --> 01:16:13,110
No?

1412
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:15,790
Nope.

1413
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:17,510
There was nothing here.

1414
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:19,870
Just a regular bush.

1415
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:23,110
Just a regular bush.

1416
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:25,910
Nothing here.

1417
01:16:27,690 --> 01:16:30,930
Nothing suspicious at all, guys.

1418
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:33,290
Just a win, exactly!

1419
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:36,490
It's just a win, everybody!

1420
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:40,310
It's just a win!

1421
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:45,870
Look, he like, tripped.

1422
01:16:46,190 --> 01:16:47,510
It's just his allergies.

1423
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:48,910
Oh my god.

1424
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:50,590
Silly Tommy.

1425
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:52,870
Did you get a...

1426
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:55,890
Look, he's allergic to poison.

1427
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:57,110
He's allergic to poison ivy, guys.

1428
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:59,770
Guys, he's allergic to poison ivy.

1429
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:02,730
He's just going through like a little episode.

1430
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:07,850
That's really it.

1431
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:11,130
Why is everybody freaking out?

1432
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:19,130
Guys, stop freaking out, everyone!

1433
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:22,010
Stop freaking out.

1434
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:22,390
See?

1435
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:23,770
Nothing here!

1436
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:26,770
I told you guys!

1437
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:28,430
There was nothing here!

1438
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:34,730
I told you all, there was nothing to worry about.

1439
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:37,210
Okay, we'll do this and then we'll kill Schmidt.

1440
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:39,550
Alright.

1441
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:42,670
He was weak.

1442
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:45,110
Oh, this is good.

1443
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:46,870
When there's a plane, I can make sound.

1444
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,530
It's okay, nothing to worry about.

1445
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:56,290
Nothing to worry about.

1446
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:02,410
Okay, but wouldn't it be funny if I...

1447
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:08,790
That's pretty funny.

1448
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:13,610
Oh my god.

1449
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:16,170
Oh my god, he also had an allergic reaction!

1450
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:18,710
Oh my god!

1451
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:21,510
This poison ivy is so intense.

1452
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:22,450
This...

1453
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:27,630
Holy shit.

1454
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:29,830
Oh my god.

1455
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:33,670
This poison ivy, man.

1456
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:36,110
Someone's gotta check this bush out.

1457
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:42,330
They got some Bob B.

1458
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:44,030
Somebody help him!

1459
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:48,170
He's allergic to bee stings!

1460
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:53,970
Oh no, the grass.

1461
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,680
Oh no!

1462
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,000
We have a bee problem!

1463
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:08,260
We have a bee problem here!

1464
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,500
In this base!

1465
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:18,580
Oh my god, won't somebody think about the bees?

1466
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,180
Did I get him?

1467
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:26,220
Guys, I don't think I got him.

1468
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,260
Guys, I don't think I got him.

1469
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:35,400
I wanna loot him so bad, but they're looking at me over there!

1470
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:42,400
Oh my god, please just let me loot this body!

1471
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:45,600
Okay.

1472
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:48,620
It's fine.

1473
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,320
If I push out, if I just shoot me over...

1474
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,700
They don't see me.

1475
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,160
Okay, they definitely might see me now.

1476
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:57,920
Okay.

1477
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:05,630
He's alive!

1478
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:09,310
He's alive!

1479
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,240
It's a Christmas miracle!

1480
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,300
Okay, I got him.

1481
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,280
It's a Christmas miracle!

1482
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,680
Oh my god!

1483
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,180
He made it!

1484
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,800
Steve made it!

1485
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,640
Silly Steve!

1486
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:32,480
What are you doing on the barbed wire, Steve?

1487
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:34,600
You're such a silly man.

1488
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,760
He's just resting.

1489
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:40,460
Alright, so I can cross the bridge now, right?

1490
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,780
That should be safe to cross the bridge now.

1491
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,720
Like, surely...

1492
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:50,220
Surely the bush has killed enough.

1493
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:56,660
I'm pretty sure the bush has done enough.

1494
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,680
Taking a nap on the job, Steve.

1495
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,980
You're so silly.

1496
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:08,360
Oh!

1497
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:15,040
Nice.

1498
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,220
We got an officer.

1499
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:19,800
What happens?

1500
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:22,600
Inspire soldiers to get out, cover, and track you down?

1501
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:23,760
Oh shit!

1502
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:24,380
That's right!

1503
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:25,620
You lost your brain!

1504
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:28,000
What would the soldiers do?

1505
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,600
Plastic, thank you for the five gifted ships.

1506
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:33,780
Thank you, thank you!

1507
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,000
Look, that was his.

1508
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:38,160
You know what that hat was.

1509
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,360
Yeah, that was...

1510
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,540
You know exactly.

1511
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,520
You know exactly what that had on.

1512
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,340
This is my message to all of you.

1513
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:06,950
Three more days.

1514
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:08,570
You guys can do it.

1515
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,050
It's just three more days.

1516
01:22:13,010 --> 01:22:13,670
Alright, alright.

1517
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:16,370
I killed Nazis.

1518
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:18,210
One of them is over here.

1519
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:24,820
Where are they?

1520
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,920
Okay, well I'll go this way then.

1521
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:33,040
I'm gonna go this way and hide in the bush.

1522
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,080
My favorite bush.

1523
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,940
I love these bushes.

1524
01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:43,280
Where could they be?

1525
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:45,540
I need like...

1526
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:49,660
Look for weak points in the environment and a well-placed shot may cause a reaction.

1527
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:50,720
Oh wait, really?

1528
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:53,320
Where?

1529
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:00,250
Where did I kill him?

1530
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:07,310
Wait, where did I kill him though?

1531
01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:13,590
What?!

1532
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:14,790
There we go.

1533
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:17,330
Okay, alright.

1534
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:19,290
I fucking hate Blitz.

1535
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:20,450
I hate the win.

1536
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:22,550
I fucking hate the win.

1537
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:28,950
Alright, get over here.

1538
01:23:30,490 --> 01:23:31,550
Where's his body?

1539
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:35,150
Sometimes I'm like, where did I kill the- oh, there they are.

1540
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:38,090
Alright, I need you.

1541
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:41,370
I need ammo really badly.

1542
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:45,490
God damn it.

1543
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:48,730
That must have been the win.

1544
01:23:57,140 --> 01:24:01,260
Where the fuck is- I need to kill two former officers, but where are they?

1545
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,900
Oh my god.

1546
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:11,360
That should be the drop-off, right?

1547
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,360
Where is it going?

1548
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:17,360
There was nobody there.

1549
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,180
But it was cool though.

1550
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:26,700
Guys it looked cool.

1551
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,360
Guys, guys it looked cool though.

1552
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,480
I got the shot though.

1553
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,960
Guys, but I got the shot.

1554
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,900
It looked really cool.

1555
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:49,780
There we go.

1556
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:54,880
It looked really fucking cool.

1557
01:24:55,900 --> 01:25:00,480
Okay, he's like next to a bush.

1558
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:01,780
Thank god.

1559
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,220
I'm trying to find another officer.

1560
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:07,120
I'll be able to kill four.

1561
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:13,910
I don't have a lot of ammo left.

1562
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:19,590
Infantry, infantry.

1563
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:20,510
The fuck?

1564
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:21,450
Where are you?

1565
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:28,160
Oh!

1566
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:29,680
Oh!

1567
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:34,180
I thought when they said four, zero- Oh, I'm so stupid.

1568
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:35,920
This is where the other officers are.

1569
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:43,120
I thought when it was like one out of four, I thought it meant like there's four in this one area.

1570
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:45,140
Okay, I can leave.

1571
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,740
I can go.

1572
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,420
Oh, that's what they mean.

1573
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,260
Okay, I'm running out of ammo.

1574
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:53,980
I'm gonna start.

1575
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:54,260
I'm gonna start.

1576
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:55,400
Blazing.

1577
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,240
All right, this is it.

1578
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:00,780
I'm gonna try and find other snipers to kill.

1579
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:03,240
It's over.

1580
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,000
It's over.

1581
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:06,360
I'm done sniping.

1582
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:07,260
Where are you?

1583
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,020
Do you have ammo?

1584
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,240
I really need ammo.

1585
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,420
I think I've grabbed all I can.

1586
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:22,860
Did you give me any?

1587
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:23,920
God damn it.

1588
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:25,520
All right.

1589
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:27,640
You're right, I can just melee.

1590
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:31,720
I'm done.

1591
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:34,480
Oh, search buildings?

1592
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:35,380
Oh, you're right, team.

1593
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:37,340
I actually- There might be some in the building.

1594
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:41,840
I'm out of- Oh, wait, am I just out of suppress?

1595
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:43,160
Oh, that's true.

1596
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:45,100
I can just be out of suppressed ammo.

1597
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:46,660
What's this?

1598
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:49,900
Okay, I got letters.

1599
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:51,480
I got pistol ammo.

1600
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:53,380
Nobody lives here anymore.

1601
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:54,760
I wonder what happened.

1602
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:57,880
Huh.

1603
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:02,600
I wonder what happened to all the- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1604
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,260
I wonder what happened to all the people here.

1605
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,880
That's so weird, guys.

1606
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,580
It's like a ghost town.

1607
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,660
I wonder if it's allergy season.

1608
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:20,660
The poison- Yeah, it could've been- I heard poison ivy is really bad.

1609
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:23,040
At this time of the year.

1610
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:27,760
Oh, we have a TNT!

1611
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:31,740
Wait, I want to use it.

1612
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:39,600
I wonder if I can do like Ash does and just throw a TNT in the air and just shoot it.

1613
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,000
That would be cool.

1614
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:44,500
Okay, we're just gonna kill General Schmidt.

1615
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:45,900
Alright, Schmitty.

1616
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:48,440
I'm coming over, Schmitty.

1617
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:52,960
Got a lot of practice, Schmitty.

1618
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,920
Okay, wait, let's- Oh yeah, I definitely have enough.

1619
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,280
Wait, but I want to use TNT.

1620
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,600
What happens if I-

1621
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:10,890
TNT is powerful.

1622
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:16,830
It needs to receive damage to throw for precise or simply drop spaces.

1623
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:18,670
There's no need to trigger- Oh, let's do it.

1624
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:21,270
Wait, I have an idea.

1625
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:23,070
Oh, I have a funny idea.

1626
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:25,770
I have a really funny idea.

1627
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:27,490
Okay, watch this, guys.

1628
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:30,230
I need to get to the bush, though.

1629
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:34,550
Watch this.

1630
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:35,830
I have a really funny idea.

1631
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:41,450
Wait, where is it?

1632
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:49,070
Okay, and then...

1633
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:52,950
Wait, where did my TNT go?

1634
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:01,940
That's not the idea I had, but like...

1635
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,460
I can't find the TNT.

1636
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:09,620
I don't know where it is.

1637
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:11,700
Okay, it works if I'm up here.

1638
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:12,920
Okay, okay.

1639
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:17,280
This is a really funny idea, but I can get it to work if I'm up here, though.

1640
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:20,620
Is it over here?

1641
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,200
Okay, guys, watch this.

1642
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:23,080
It's gonna be so funny.

1643
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:25,060
Okay.

1644
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,160
Come on, get over here.

1645
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,220
Come on!

1646
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:40,040
Wait, did he see me?

1647
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:40,580
Oh!

1648
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:42,360
I

1649
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:47,360
have a tree!

1650
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:48,920
Oh, no.

1651
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:49,820
Oh, no.

1652
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:51,500
Oh, no!

1653
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:52,680
My funny idea!

1654
01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:55,380
My so funny idea!

1655
01:30:01,510 --> 01:30:02,230
No!

1656
01:30:04,330 --> 01:30:05,390
Funny idea!

1657
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:09,290
Okay.

1658
01:30:09,630 --> 01:30:11,350
No, they saw me!

1659
01:30:11,690 --> 01:30:12,410
Oh, no.

1660
01:30:13,130 --> 01:30:14,610
No, my TNT!

1661
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:18,290
Okay.

1662
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:23,830
Okay, I got one of them out of the way.

1663
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:26,370
They don't know.

1664
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:27,870
They don't know.

1665
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:29,130
Get up!

1666
01:30:29,210 --> 01:30:30,030
Get up, soldier!

1667
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:34,430
Okay.

1668
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:38,030
Wait, he still sees me?

1669
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:42,710
Where?

1670
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:46,950
Oh, thank God.

1671
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:48,030
Next shot.

1672
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:50,230
He's still on me.

1673
01:30:50,230 --> 01:30:51,390
He's still on me.

1674
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:57,070
Okay, but will he see me if I'm here?

1675
01:30:57,470 --> 01:30:59,010
Oh, my God, he does!

1676
01:30:59,550 --> 01:31:00,070
Wait!

1677
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:01,970
Okay, but what if I'm here?

1678
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:04,010
Okay, he doesn't know.

1679
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:05,370
I'm so far away.

1680
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:06,970
There's no way.

1681
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:10,590
There's no way they know I'm here now.

1682
01:31:11,230 --> 01:31:12,550
I'm in this bush.

1683
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:15,010
That's a different bush, guys.

1684
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:16,030
Oh, shit!

1685
01:31:19,650 --> 01:31:20,530
Guys, he knew.

1686
01:31:23,170 --> 01:31:24,570
I don't understand.

1687
01:31:24,830 --> 01:31:26,270
I was in a different bush.

1688
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:29,570
Okay, but I'm in this bush now.

1689
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:35,370
I'm in a different bush this time, guys.

1690
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:36,430
He doesn't know.

1691
01:31:41,150 --> 01:31:42,950
Guys, I'm in a different bush!

1692
01:31:43,690 --> 01:31:44,570
It's different!

1693
01:31:47,650 --> 01:31:49,190
Okay, but like...

1694
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:50,470
Look at this funny idea, though.

1695
01:31:53,310 --> 01:31:54,950
Okay, watch this funny idea.

1696
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:01,050
Where did I throw it?

1697
01:32:03,890 --> 01:32:05,410
Wait, where did I throw it?

1698
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:09,230
Wait, where is it?

1699
01:32:11,690 --> 01:32:13,190
Where did I throw it?

1700
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:17,390
Where is it?

1701
01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:20,930
Wait, where's my...

1702
01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:21,610
Oh, there it is.

1703
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:22,210
There it is.

1704
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:26,010
Okay, watch this, guys.

1705
01:32:26,190 --> 01:32:27,130
It's gonna be so funny.

1706
01:32:27,210 --> 01:32:27,770
Watch this.

1707
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,130
It's gonna be so funny.

1708
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:42,310
Wait, he lives?

1709
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,140
Look at that.

1710
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,380
That was pretty funny, guys.

1711
01:32:57,190 --> 01:32:58,730
Guys, watch this, guys.

1712
01:32:59,050 --> 01:32:59,630
Watch this.

1713
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:00,770
I see him right over here.

1714
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:01,110
Yeah?

1715
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:09,900
Oh, whoops.

1716
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:12,640
I thought I shot it!

1717
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,860
Okay, but like...

1718
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:18,140
You can't dodge this, though.

1719
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:21,300
There's no way he's gonna dodge this.

1720
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:29,000
There we go, we did it.

1721
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:33,000
I told you, guys!

1722
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,480
I told you!

1723
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,900
We used up all our...

1724
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:41,300
grenades, but that's okay.

1725
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:43,520
It was all for the funny, guys.

1726
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:46,880
It was all for the funny.

1727
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,660
Okay, we already got his stuff.

1728
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:52,200
Oh.

1729
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:55,180
Okay, we did it.

1730
01:33:59,070 --> 01:33:59,910
Oh, there he is.

1731
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:00,630
Oh my god!

1732
01:34:00,690 --> 01:34:02,330
He got flung so far away!

1733
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:04,610
Sir, I need your body.

1734
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:06,990
I need the ammo.

1735
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:08,110
I'm running out.

1736
01:34:10,730 --> 01:34:11,290
Okay.

1737
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:12,850
How much do I have from suppress?

1738
01:34:13,010 --> 01:34:13,910
I still only have 50.

1739
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:17,590
I think they're starting to build their bush immunity!

1740
01:34:18,090 --> 01:34:19,470
No, don't say that!

1741
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:20,450
Don't...

1742
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:22,850
Don't say that, guys!

1743
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:26,050
Nobody is immune to the bush forever!

1744
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:33,650
They can't!

1745
01:34:33,670 --> 01:34:36,210
That's the one thing you can't build immunity for!

1746
01:34:36,990 --> 01:34:38,490
Oh, hey, Steve's still here.

1747
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:45,160
Hey, Steve!

1748
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:47,920
Having a good time over here?

1749
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:49,640
Guys, I am learning, though.

1750
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:50,680
Like...

1751
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:51,480
Okay!

1752
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:54,440
I am getting better!

1753
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:57,900
I'm figuring this out, boy!

1754
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:01,100
Alright, we gotta kill General Schmidt.

1755
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:03,340
Oh, General Schmidt!

1756
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,120
I'm coming over!

1757
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,800
I learned a lot today.

1758
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:08,280
Oh, hey!

1759
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:09,940
How did these guys die?

1760
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:11,880
Who killed them?

1761
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:14,340
Who could it be?

1762
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:19,060
I wonder who could have killed these guys.

1763
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:21,560
Okay.

1764
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:23,640
Oh.

1765
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:30,630
That has to be a headshot.

1766
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:32,230
Oh!

1767
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:38,480
Wait, that was Schmidt?

1768
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:41,920
Wait, was that...

1769
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:42,260
Oh!

1770
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:44,140
Oh!

1771
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:45,960
What the fuck?

1772
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:48,080
What was he doing over there?

1773
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:51,180
What the fuck?

1774
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:52,180
Schmitty!

1775
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:57,560
What the fuck were you doing there, Schmitty?

1776
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:02,800
I didn't realize I was Schmitty this entire time!

1777
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:03,720
Oh, shit!

1778
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:05,840
Oh, shit!

1779
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:06,780
Oh, shit!

1780
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:13,180
Schmitty just wanted to admire the view!

1781
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:15,220
No, not again!

1782
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:17,540
No!

1783
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:20,500
I killed Schmitty though!

1784
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:27,520
Okay, but what the fuck was he doing?

1785
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:30,020
I did not expect him to be there!

1786
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,220
Oh my god, how did they know?

1787
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:39,220
There's no way they know I ran this way though.

1788
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:41,320
Oh, there he is.

1789
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:41,780
They know.

1790
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:46,460
Okay, but there's no way they know I ran this way.

1791
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,040
They do.

1792
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:51,040
Okay, but what if I'm here?

1793
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:52,500
Oh, they also do.

1794
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,820
Okay, but what if I'm over here?

1795
01:36:57,180 --> 01:36:58,800
Guys, how do they keep knowing?

1796
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,820
Like, okay, but what if I'm like here?

1797
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:06,500
Oh, they don't know I'm here now.

1798
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,780
They don't know, they think I'm over there.

1799
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:11,080
Oh my god, guys!

1800
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:12,340
Guys!

1801
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:13,980
There's a lot of them!

1802
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:23,800
Guys, I'm- I don't think they know I'm in the bush next door.

1803
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:29,260
There's no way they know I'm next door, right?

1804
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,080
There's no way!

1805
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:33,980
I can't use the TNT trick!

1806
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:36,420
I don't know where the-

1807
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:41,320
Okay.

1808
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:47,940
Okay, but what if they- What if they look at this TNT right there?

1809
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:54,240
Okay.

1810
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:58,980
What if they look at this TNT over here?

1811
01:38:17,550 --> 01:38:22,310
Three times the- The bush claims another.

1812
01:38:28,930 --> 01:38:30,810
The bush claims another.

1813
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:31,350
Hahaha!

1814
01:38:36,470 --> 01:38:39,310
See, and this is why you wear a helmet, guys.

1815
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:44,330
This is exactly why you wear- Okay, but what if like- Okay, wait, I got an idea.

1816
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:48,960
Come over here.

1817
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,180
That's right.

1818
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,940
Come over here.

1819
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:57,800
No, you One, two...

1820
01:38:58,420 --> 01:38:59,640
Oh, they're coming.

1821
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:01,140
They're coming over.

1822
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,260
They're- oh, that's two.

1823
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:08,060
That's two.

1824
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:09,300
That's three.

1825
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:12,200
Wait, four, three.

1826
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:13,880
Come on, get the third guy in here!

1827
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:20,430
Two is fine enough.

1828
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:21,650
That's fine enough for me.

1829
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:24,990
That's- Okay, we did it.

1830
01:39:24,990 --> 01:39:26,810
Oh, I almost did it!

1831
01:39:31,470 --> 01:39:32,670
I made a little mistake.

1832
01:39:35,870 --> 01:39:38,250
I got a little excited.

1833
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:41,970
I got- I got a little excited, guys.

1834
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:45,870
I made a little mistake.

1835
01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:50,190
Okay, but like- but like, the bush calls.

1836
01:39:51,190 --> 01:39:53,550
The bush calls.

1837
01:39:56,190 --> 01:39:57,390
Oh my god.

1838
01:39:57,870 --> 01:39:59,050
Oh my god, this bush is...

1839
01:40:01,470 --> 01:40:02,910
This bush keeps spitting out rocks.

1840
01:40:03,010 --> 01:40:04,030
What's going on?

1841
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:05,970
The bush yearns for more.

1842
01:40:09,130 --> 01:40:11,390
It yearns for more.

1843
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:14,590
Okay, let's bandage ourselves up.

1844
01:40:14,710 --> 01:40:15,040
We got...

1845
01:40:20,030 --> 01:40:22,080
The bush thirsts for blood.

1846
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,500
Okay, let's get this guy out of the way.

1847
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:35,510
Okay, we're fine now.

1848
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:40,590
All right, we gotta search up Schmitty.

1849
01:40:41,390 --> 01:40:43,330
You feed the bush.

1850
01:40:46,510 --> 01:40:48,070
Feed the bush.

1851
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:53,560
All right, we gotta loot him.

1852
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:55,820
And then you gotta loot him.

1853
01:40:55,940 --> 01:41:04,380
I didn't realize that was J- He's just out in the- I thought that he would be like, I don't know, deeper in the fucking building.

1854
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,680
He's just out there admiring.

1855
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:24,800
Okay, if I was a general of, you know, one of the most like, try- like one of the most like, you know, sought after guy who's trying to get assassinated and everything, I would not be standing in the fucking open admiring the view with no one next to him.

1856
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:33,600
Like- I legitimately- I legitimately thought he would be like, deeper in that building.

1857
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:36,420
He was- he was admiring the bush.

1858
01:41:36,580 --> 01:41:38,380
He was literally right there.

1859
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:41,900
That was like- that seemed like- that seemed like a different guy.

1860
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:45,160
He was like, what the fuck?

1861
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:47,080
I thought he would be in the building.

1862
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:49,460
What are you doing here?

1863
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:54,240
He heard about the bush.

1864
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:55,880
Safeholds important.

1865
01:41:56,060 --> 01:41:57,740
And every- make sure you search important enemies.

1866
01:41:58,260 --> 01:41:59,380
You just blow up the safe.

1867
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:02,120
That blast may destroy some- but that's a risk worth taking, right?

1868
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:03,240
What did I got?

1869
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,280
All right, we can get the safe too.

1870
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,580
He heard about the infamous bush.

1871
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:12,640
He had to come in.

1872
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:18,080
Okay, we can- I feel like we've killed everybody in this house.

1873
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:21,520
I mean, their leader just died because of me.

1874
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:26,420
But where is this guy though?

1875
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:28,620
I think he's inside here.

1876
01:42:38,890 --> 01:42:41,350
Huh, how do I get to the safe?

1877
01:42:43,130 --> 01:42:45,270
I killed like- like three people.

1878
01:42:45,790 --> 01:42:47,730
No, I didn't kill three.

1879
01:42:47,930 --> 01:42:48,890
The bush did.

1880
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:55,100
This isn't even a good view over here.

1881
01:42:55,180 --> 01:42:57,320
Like, it would make sense if it was looking this way.

1882
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:59,400
What is he looking over here?

1883
01:43:04,190 --> 01:43:07,130
And it would make more sense if it was the other way.

1884
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:12,680
How do we go upstairs though?

1885
01:43:18,990 --> 01:43:20,110
Oh, he's over there.

1886
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:21,330
I'm just gonna kill this guy.

1887
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:23,610
There we go.

1888
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:26,350
Like, you're literally the last guy alive.

1889
01:43:26,550 --> 01:43:30,550
Like, I- Nobody will hear you scream.

1890
01:43:32,270 --> 01:43:34,490
No one will hear you scream.

1891
01:43:34,670 --> 01:43:36,810
Everyone- all your friends are dead.

1892
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:37,030
Dead.

1893
01:43:39,790 --> 01:43:41,490
Okay, this has to be it.

1894
01:43:41,530 --> 01:43:42,050
There we go.

1895
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:45,750
All right, nice.

1896
01:43:46,730 --> 01:43:47,530
Use code.

1897
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:52,690
Yay, we did it!

1898
01:43:53,070 --> 01:43:54,470
Wait, what's this?

1899
01:43:55,810 --> 01:43:58,730
Swatch h- swap hdm for luger?

1900
01:44:00,070 --> 01:44:00,850
Whoa!

1901
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:04,910
Yeah, but this one's suppressed.

1902
01:44:05,650 --> 01:44:07,270
Why would I ever swap that?

1903
01:44:09,250 --> 01:44:10,470
Wait, use code doki bird.

1904
01:44:10,770 --> 01:44:11,770
Okay, how do I get out?

1905
01:44:15,570 --> 01:44:16,470
Did I not win?

1906
01:44:18,510 --> 01:44:20,610
Oh, I have to kill all of them?

1907
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:23,990
But I killed the main guy.

1908
01:44:27,740 --> 01:44:29,900
Oh, you have to kill all of them.

1909
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,440
I thought like if you kill the main guy, it's over.

1910
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:38,540
Okay.

1911
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:40,380
That's right.

1912
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:44,200
Destroy.

1913
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,740
Destroy the history.

1914
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:47,120
No recordings.

1915
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,940
Yeah, I mean it worked for that guy.

1916
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:56,820
It worked for the guy I'm gonna kill next in the next mission.

1917
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:01,060
That's basically how it goes.

1918
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:02,580
Did they not surrender?

1919
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:04,760
Like, what happened?

1920
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:12,000
It's usually how it goes!

1921
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:16,220
Okay, you guys want me to try the- oh, let's try it.

1922
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:17,220
Okay, let's try it.

1923
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:23,020
Future generations must not know this strat.

1924
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:26,020
To be fair, people thought like he didn't actually die.

1925
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:27,620
People were like, there's no way.

1926
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:31,240
Damn, I thought he was supposed to be a god.

1927
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,740
To be fair, yeah, like nobody believed.

1928
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:41,820
Nobody believed he actually died- died.

1929
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:43,720
Okay.

1930
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:49,480
All right, let's see.

1931
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:54,260
We gotta kill the officer in this area.

1932
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:57,100
Wouldn't it be funny if we find him right away too?

1933
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:01,200
Oh, this one's difficult.

1934
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:02,600
Wait, there's no bushes here!

1935
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:05,740
Oh, this is more difficult.

1936
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,240
How am I supposed to kill that one guy?

1937
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:10,740
With all my bushes!

1938
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:20,210
Oh, this is bad.

1939
01:46:20,850 --> 01:46:23,490
I don't know how to play this game without foilage.

1940
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:33,010
What do I do when there's no nature to help me?

1941
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:45,620
What?!

1942
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,700
My one bush!

1943
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:51,360
Hahaha!

1944
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,040
Me and my one bush.

1945
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:58,140
No, he's blowing the whistle!

1946
01:46:58,320 --> 01:46:59,920
He's blowing the whistle, guys!

1947
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:02,480
He's blowing the whistle!

1948
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:03,760
What do I do?!

1949
01:47:09,910 --> 01:47:11,910
Okay, maybe he'll come closer.

1950
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:16,110
The bush hungers.

1951
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:19,870
The bush- oh, fuck.

1952
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:21,270
Okay, um...

1953
01:47:23,630 --> 01:47:25,310
Um, how do I do this?

1954
01:47:26,210 --> 01:47:27,150
Press hold.

1955
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:28,590
Oh, wait, fuck.

1956
01:47:28,690 --> 01:47:30,950
Okay, I can't- I have to set the mine.

1957
01:47:31,710 --> 01:47:32,730
Okay, this is bad.

1958
01:47:32,770 --> 01:47:33,150
Okay.

1959
01:47:33,830 --> 01:47:34,570
Trip mine.

1960
01:47:35,110 --> 01:47:36,530
Okay, what about teller mine?

1961
01:47:36,630 --> 01:47:37,710
Oh, okay.

1962
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:44,300
There's no way I can die from here.

1963
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:49,170
Wait.

1964
01:47:51,530 --> 01:47:52,970
There's so many there.

1965
01:47:53,230 --> 01:47:56,610
There's so- There's no way!

1966
01:47:58,850 --> 01:48:02,290
There's literally like 500 of them next to this!

1967
01:48:03,770 --> 01:48:05,230
Just walk over!

1968
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:20,390
Yeah, I was.

1969
01:48:23,570 --> 01:48:25,710
I was over there.

1970
01:48:27,150 --> 01:48:27,810
Oh, shit.

1971
01:48:31,110 --> 01:48:32,810
Yeah, I was over there.

1972
01:48:37,330 --> 01:48:38,970
Famous last words.

1973
01:48:41,070 --> 01:48:43,650
Bro, he's just blowing on his whistle like a nerd.

1974
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:45,290
All right.

1975
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,220
Oh, I see him.

1976
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:54,560
Oh, I see him.

1977
01:48:54,620 --> 01:48:55,720
Oh, they're scared.

1978
01:48:56,280 --> 01:49:03,780
I can't get out of the bush because I'm one guy- Oh, what?!

1979
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:09,120
I'm- Are you serious?!

1980
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:12,930
Okay, we do this again.

1981
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:14,230
I literally pressed D!

1982
01:49:15,430 --> 01:49:18,250
I pressed D, I swear to god!

1983
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,420
I swear to god!

1984
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:27,620
He killed- He did it!

1985
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:29,000
He did it!

1986
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:31,720
He finally defeated the evil!

1987
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:40,500
He finally did it.

1988
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:44,460
He finally did it.

1989
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:49,240
Is it not E for the knife?!

1990
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,440
What the fuck was it?!

1991
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:52,520
Okay, now I'm mad.

1992
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:54,460
What is knife?

1993
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:56,520
I did E!

1994
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:01,480
I got knife!

1995
01:50:03,370 --> 01:50:04,590
Push that shot.

1996
01:50:05,010 --> 01:50:06,350
The funny mustache.

1997
01:50:06,670 --> 01:50:09,290
The bush took me instead.

1998
01:50:10,290 --> 01:50:10,550
No!

1999
01:50:12,350 --> 01:50:15,250
E is for- Why can't I melee?!

2000
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:17,330
What the fuck is melee then?!

2001
01:50:19,390 --> 01:50:22,790
What the fuck is- Get in the- Get in!

2002
01:50:28,050 --> 01:50:29,230
Get in here.

2003
01:50:29,950 --> 01:50:36,870
Please, just die to my- What's regular melee?!

2004
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:40,870
The evil has been defeated.

2005
01:50:41,370 --> 01:50:43,110
Please, there's so many.

2006
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:47,370
Please, is nobody thinking this is suspicious at all?

2007
01:50:47,910 --> 01:50:51,990
Is- Does no one- Does no one find this weird?

2008
01:50:55,560 --> 01:51:00,700
There's no one find this weird that there's a fuck- There's 2,000 rocks coming out of that.

2009
01:51:07,770 --> 01:51:08,490
Oh, yeah.

2010
01:51:08,890 --> 01:51:10,110
Wait, they saw me?

2011
01:51:11,550 --> 01:51:12,610
Guys, they saw me.

2012
01:51:14,250 --> 01:51:15,950
Because I think they saw me.

2013
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:22,300
Guys, I think they saw me in this bush.

2014
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:23,980
Like, I'm not sure yet.

2015
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:24,600
AHH!

2016
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:26,380
NOOO!

2017
01:51:30,170 --> 01:51:31,670
Guys, they don't know.

2018
01:51:40,130 --> 01:51:46,010
This is like- Nobody wanted to go near my dynamite.

2019
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:47,610
I don't know what- No, I got it.

2020
01:51:47,610 --> 01:51:48,210
I got an idea.

2021
01:51:48,590 --> 01:51:50,210
Oh, I have enough suppressed ammo now.

2022
01:51:50,310 --> 01:51:50,510
Okay.

2023
01:51:50,590 --> 01:51:51,370
Wait, this is it.

2024
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:52,890
Okay.

2025
01:51:53,810 --> 01:51:55,170
Oh, and then he ran off.

2026
01:51:55,210 --> 01:51:55,710
That's fine.

2027
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:58,390
Maybe I can do the rock thing again.

2028
01:51:59,170 --> 01:52:05,030
Guys, look at all these- Look at all these- Look at this dynamite.

2029
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:06,810
It's just sitting there.

2030
01:52:07,590 --> 01:52:09,670
Look at all that.

2031
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:12,890
Come on!

2032
01:52:14,550 --> 01:52:17,070
It's gonna be so fun.

2033
01:52:19,190 --> 01:52:20,670
Please, anybody.

2034
01:52:21,870 --> 01:52:22,510
Oh, thank god.

2035
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,270
Are you serious?

2036
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:30,390
There we go.

2037
01:52:30,510 --> 01:52:32,030
I had to throw his bullet drop off.

2038
01:52:32,670 --> 01:52:33,730
There we go.

2039
01:52:34,170 --> 01:52:34,830
Nice.

2040
01:52:35,930 --> 01:52:39,370
Oh, that looks nasty.

2041
01:52:39,730 --> 01:52:44,770
Oh, at least I got- Oh, I hit him in the eye too?

2042
01:52:47,170 --> 01:52:49,590
Please, I just- I need one.

2043
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:53,630
Please, just one guy show up, please.

2044
01:52:55,210 --> 01:52:55,450
Wait.

2045
01:52:57,470 --> 01:52:58,110
Okay.

2046
01:52:58,110 --> 01:52:58,430
Okay.

2047
01:52:59,970 --> 01:53:01,350
He ran away?

2048
01:53:02,710 --> 01:53:04,070
Why must you run away?

2049
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:06,010
What are you afraid of?

2050
01:53:08,270 --> 01:53:10,050
Oh my god, I want to get out of this.

2051
01:53:10,530 --> 01:53:11,430
I can't get out.

2052
01:53:12,290 --> 01:53:13,870
Why do they keep running away?

2053
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:16,550
Look at all these rocks.

2054
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:21,080
Maybe he runs away.

2055
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:22,060
I can pick this up now.

2056
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:26,760
Oh.

2057
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:32,740
Oh my god.

2058
01:53:35,380 --> 01:53:35,940
Please!

2059
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:39,580
I just- Okay, we could do this again.

2060
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,100
Please, I- Leave me alone.

2061
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:44,100
Okay, this is it.

2062
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:45,260
This is it.

2063
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:47,700
I'm not- I'm not fucking around no more.

2064
01:54:02,030 --> 01:54:03,470
Wait, my god!

2065
01:54:03,990 --> 01:54:04,410
What?

2066
01:54:04,650 --> 01:54:05,930
What happened?

2067
01:54:09,770 --> 01:54:10,490
What?

2068
01:54:10,490 --> 01:54:11,750
What killed me?

2069
01:54:12,110 --> 01:54:12,790
What?

2070
01:54:13,090 --> 01:54:14,730
What killed me?

2071
01:54:15,310 --> 01:54:15,830
Nuff.

2072
01:54:16,270 --> 01:54:18,170
What actually killed me?

2073
01:54:18,550 --> 01:54:25,650
He fucking helped- Oh, oh, I'm gonna- Okay, now I'm actually not fucking around no more.

2074
01:54:27,150 --> 01:54:28,410
Where's that gonna go?

2075
01:54:31,070 --> 01:54:32,530
Okay, it went that way.

2076
01:54:33,030 --> 01:54:33,750
Okay.

2077
01:54:34,490 --> 01:54:34,990
All right.

2078
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:38,430
I have an idea.

2079
01:54:39,070 --> 01:54:41,270
Guys, guys, I figured this out, guys.

2080
01:54:42,030 --> 01:54:43,350
I have an idea.

2081
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:50,700
Okay, I mean that works too.

2082
01:54:57,430 --> 01:54:59,390
Okay, but what if like-

2083
01:55:08,890 --> 01:55:11,510
Okay, okay, okay, this works!

2084
01:55:15,090 --> 01:55:16,030
This works!

2085
01:55:16,590 --> 01:55:17,530
This works!

2086
01:55:17,970 --> 01:55:19,690
Guys, I figured it out!

2087
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:27,960
Oh, shit!

2088
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:31,300
I can do it again.

2089
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:41,200
Oh, shit!

2090
01:55:41,860 --> 01:55:42,700
Yes!

2091
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:46,560
We did it.

2092
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:48,480
We fucking did it.

2093
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,560
Oh, shit!

2094
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:57,200
Wait, we gotta defuse it.

2095
01:55:58,840 --> 01:55:59,380
I

2096
01:56:09,670 --> 01:56:10,390
did so much!

2097
01:56:18,510 --> 01:56:19,090
Oh, god!

2098
01:56:19,250 --> 01:56:19,850
Oh, god!

2099
01:56:20,010 --> 01:56:20,690
Oh, god!

2100
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:21,470
Oh, god!

2101
01:56:21,770 --> 01:56:22,230
Get out!

2102
01:56:22,630 --> 01:56:23,130
Get out!

2103
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:24,050
Get out!

2104
01:56:26,710 --> 01:56:27,970
It's okay, we're fine.

2105
01:56:28,250 --> 01:56:29,490
We're so healthy.

2106
01:56:29,890 --> 01:56:31,210
We're so healthy.

2107
01:56:34,570 --> 01:56:35,790
Where is he?

2108
01:56:38,370 --> 01:56:39,290
There we go.

2109
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:43,910
Oh my god, look at my- Look at all these bodies!

2110
01:56:44,890 --> 01:56:46,010
We did it!

2111
01:56:47,070 --> 01:56:47,710
Yay!

2112
01:56:52,210 --> 01:56:54,610
Oh my god, we did it, everybody!

2113
01:56:55,690 --> 01:56:57,110
It's just that easy!

2114
01:56:58,110 --> 01:56:59,070
Look at that!

2115
01:57:03,530 --> 01:57:07,070
All right, we just gotta get all our fucking loot back.

2116
01:57:08,390 --> 01:57:09,590
See, guys?

2117
01:57:10,290 --> 01:57:11,830
See, it wasn't that hard.

2118
01:57:13,670 --> 01:57:17,930
Guys, it wasn't that difficult, guys.

2119
01:57:19,150 --> 01:57:21,810
All it took was five mines.

2120
01:57:23,870 --> 01:57:25,870
And then you two can succeed.

2121
01:57:26,890 --> 01:57:30,970
Jesus, I turned into minesweeper.

2122
01:57:31,530 --> 01:57:34,810
It was- it was not sniper elite anymore.

2123
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:37,810
It was a minesweeper time.

2124
01:57:38,930 --> 01:57:40,370
Oh, they never learn!

2125
01:57:42,210 --> 01:57:44,670
They just never learn, what can I say?

2126
01:57:45,650 --> 01:57:47,670
They could have learned, they just didn't.

2127
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:53,740
Mines elite four.

2128
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:57,420
I should have done the same.

2129
01:57:58,760 --> 01:57:59,960
I was in a corner!

2130
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,660
What else was I supposed to do in that corner?

2131
01:58:03,700 --> 01:58:05,140
Okay, one- two more.

2132
01:58:06,280 --> 01:58:06,940
Two more.

2133
01:58:08,300 --> 01:58:09,300
Oh, you're next.

2134
01:58:09,860 --> 01:58:10,880
Oh, you're next.

2135
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:13,380
I see you up there.

2136
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:16,740
You're fucking next, I'm heading over.

2137
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:19,700
I'm fucking heading over right now.

2138
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:22,260
That's right!

2139
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:24,040
That's right!

2140
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:25,400
I'm getting over!

2141
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:31,320
All right.

2142
01:58:36,330 --> 01:58:40,310
Okay, let's see if I get to this.

2143
01:58:40,430 --> 01:58:42,410
Oh, there's more bushes here, thank fucking god.

2144
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:47,320
Okay, that's good.

2145
01:58:48,140 --> 01:58:50,680
Oh lord, she's coming over.

2146
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:54,260
Am I using suppressed?

2147
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:55,160
I am.

2148
01:58:58,910 --> 01:58:59,610
Wait, what?

2149
01:59:01,290 --> 01:59:01,850
There we go.

2150
01:59:05,490 --> 01:59:06,250
It's fine.

2151
01:59:07,010 --> 01:59:07,710
That's fine.

2152
01:59:07,770 --> 01:59:08,210
That's fine.

2153
01:59:08,270 --> 01:59:09,270
Everything is fine.

2154
01:59:12,790 --> 01:59:13,830
Come on.

2155
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:17,010
Everything is not fine anymore.

2156
01:59:17,110 --> 01:59:18,250
Everything is not fine anymore.

2157
01:59:18,370 --> 01:59:19,230
Guys, guys!

2158
01:59:19,230 --> 01:59:21,190
Everything is not fine anymore.

2159
01:59:21,350 --> 01:59:23,050
Everything is fine anymore.

2160
01:59:26,030 --> 01:59:27,370
Oh, it's fine.

2161
01:59:27,550 --> 01:59:28,450
No, it's okay.

2162
01:59:28,530 --> 01:59:29,230
It's okay.

2163
01:59:30,610 --> 01:59:31,270
Push.

2164
01:59:31,410 --> 01:59:32,110
Wait, wait,

2165
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:41,750
wait.

2166
01:59:45,230 --> 01:59:46,350
I've learned.

2167
01:59:46,790 --> 01:59:48,410
I've learned the strat.

2168
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:51,130
You have to go right here.

2169
01:59:52,870 --> 01:59:54,850
You have to cross right here.

2170
01:59:55,010 --> 01:59:56,910
That's where my triangle was.

2171
01:59:58,870 --> 02:00:00,230
That's where it was.

2172
02:00:00,790 --> 02:00:02,170
Come on, touch the triangle.

2173
02:00:02,830 --> 02:00:04,250
Come on, touch the triangle.

2174
02:00:04,610 --> 02:00:06,950
You know you want to touch the triangle.

2175
02:00:07,990 --> 02:00:09,330
Oh, I see you, officer.

2176
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:10,690
You're right over here.

2177
02:00:12,390 --> 02:00:13,950
Wait, did they shot my trap?

2178
02:00:14,570 --> 02:00:16,190
They shot it?

2179
02:00:16,590 --> 02:00:17,750
How did they know?

2180
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:23,380
How did they know?

2181
02:00:27,450 --> 02:00:30,410
Dude, I don't understand.

2182
02:00:36,030 --> 02:00:37,630
Clever girl.

2183
02:00:39,330 --> 02:00:44,110
Oh, but the officer, you're right over here.

2184
02:00:47,190 --> 02:00:50,270
You're right over here, officer.

2185
02:00:51,810 --> 02:00:53,350
I know you are.

2186
02:00:53,350 --> 02:00:53,950
You're right over here.

2187
02:01:03,010 --> 02:01:06,410
I know I could have done a takedown, but this was easier.

2188
02:01:11,810 --> 02:01:12,210
See?

2189
02:01:14,770 --> 02:01:15,170
Still.

2190
02:01:16,810 --> 02:01:19,170
Oh, I could have shot this, but then I'd die too.

2191
02:01:20,430 --> 02:01:21,370
All right, let's practice.

2192
02:01:22,790 --> 02:01:23,990
You're- WHOA!

2193
02:01:24,770 --> 02:01:27,030
Oh, shit.

2194
02:01:36,390 --> 02:01:37,390
No scope.

2195
02:01:40,050 --> 02:01:40,810
All right.

2196
02:01:43,950 --> 02:01:45,590
Okay, wait, watch this, guys.

2197
02:01:47,270 --> 02:01:48,110
I have to get closer.

2198
02:01:49,150 --> 02:01:50,050
Watch this, though.

2199
02:01:50,550 --> 02:01:52,030
Wait, okay, give me a sec.

2200
02:01:52,270 --> 02:01:53,670
Give me a sec.

2201
02:01:54,330 --> 02:01:55,810
Okay, but watch this shot.

2202
02:01:56,390 --> 02:01:57,270
Right here.

2203
02:02:01,780 --> 02:02:06,360
Okay, okay, watch this shot right here.

2204
02:02:06,820 --> 02:02:07,880
Right here.

2205
02:02:19,310 --> 02:02:20,170
WHOA!

2206
02:02:20,830 --> 02:02:21,430
Wait, where is he?

2207
02:02:22,110 --> 02:02:29,970
All right,

2208
02:02:33,190 --> 02:02:34,570
this is a you tried award.

2209
02:02:37,730 --> 02:02:38,410
Insane!

2210
02:02:38,770 --> 02:02:40,530
Guys, did you- did you see that?

2211
02:02:41,090 --> 02:02:42,390
Oh my god!

2212
02:02:43,530 --> 02:02:45,250
$3.60 scope!

2213
02:02:45,470 --> 02:02:46,850
I told you!

2214
02:02:48,270 --> 02:02:49,290
I got him!

2215
02:02:49,450 --> 02:02:50,690
I got him!

2216
02:02:50,850 --> 02:02:51,970
I got him!

2217
02:02:55,650 --> 02:02:57,650
$3.60 scope!

2218
02:02:59,930 --> 02:03:03,290
Okay, where the fuck do I get over here?

2219
02:03:04,950 --> 02:03:05,910
We gotta go this way.

2220
02:03:08,030 --> 02:03:11,530
That was a $3.60 no scope right there.

2221
02:03:12,930 --> 02:03:18,390
That's right, FPS gamer of- okay, not FPS of VTuber of the year right there.

2222
02:03:18,590 --> 02:03:19,890
That should have been my clip.

2223
02:03:20,130 --> 02:03:21,070
How the fuck, dude?

2224
02:03:21,070 --> 02:03:22,630
It's all fenced up!

2225
02:03:24,070 --> 02:03:26,730
How the fuck do I get out of here?

2226
02:03:26,810 --> 02:03:27,610
Oh, it's this way.

2227
02:03:28,790 --> 02:03:29,530
It's fine.

2228
02:03:29,610 --> 02:03:31,090
We're just gonna casually walk over.

2229
02:03:31,970 --> 02:03:34,690
Put down the VTuber awards video.

2230
02:03:35,050 --> 02:03:37,190
Mike, thank you with a super chat.

2231
02:03:37,450 --> 02:03:37,530
Thank you.

2232
02:03:37,630 --> 02:03:39,490
I'm trying to figure out how to get out of here.

2233
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:48,560
I think this is the worst part, just like trying to navigate this entire area.

2234
02:03:49,900 --> 02:03:53,180
The navi- I just- how- it's down there?!

2235
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:56,680
How the fuck do I get down there?

2236
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:01,300
Okay, I need to figure out how to get down there, guys.

2237
02:04:01,860 --> 02:04:07,160
Okay, we go from here and then we have to travel across- I have to travel across all those bases?!

2238
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:08,900
All right.

2239
02:04:09,780 --> 02:04:12,120
It's a task I'm willing to take.

2240
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:15,880
I don't have a parachute.

2241
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:17,240
Dude, fuck this.

2242
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:21,720
I'll find him.

2243
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:28,720
Where are you?

2244
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:33,320
Okay, there's him.

2245
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:35,700
I'll find him.

2246
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:38,620
Where is he?

2247
02:04:39,300 --> 02:04:41,440
I'm not going down there, guys.

2248
02:04:41,860 --> 02:04:43,660
I'm just gonna find him.

2249
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,020
No, that's just babies.

2250
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:47,960
Where is the main guy?

2251
02:04:55,010 --> 02:04:57,390
Okay, I need to find the main man.

2252
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:02,970
Yeah, I have a better sight here.

2253
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:07,440
You know what?

2254
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:12,920
Shit.

2255
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:15,100
All right, where is he?

2256
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:16,320
Oh, there you are.

2257
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:17,160
Are

2258
02:05:24,580 --> 02:05:27,280
you serious?

2259
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:32,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2260
02:05:37,130 --> 02:05:38,490
Oh, no, he saw me.

2261
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:43,100
Who's shooting me?

2262
02:05:49,630 --> 02:05:51,430
Are you fucking- ah!

2263
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:55,230
Okay, bullet trap.

2264
02:05:55,570 --> 02:05:56,490
There we go.

2265
02:05:58,650 --> 02:05:59,630
There we go.

2266
02:05:59,830 --> 02:06:04,050
Oh my god, the stupid bullet trap.

2267
02:06:04,710 --> 02:06:06,090
There we go, we did it.

2268
02:06:06,370 --> 02:06:09,350
We fucking did it.

2269
02:06:09,630 --> 02:06:11,630
We got the high ground shot.

2270
02:06:13,770 --> 02:06:14,890
Stupid wind.

2271
02:06:15,450 --> 02:06:16,930
All right, we gotta figure out how to get out of here.

2272
02:06:17,590 --> 02:06:19,690
Escape from the- ah, fucking- oh shit.

2273
02:06:19,830 --> 02:06:21,150
Okay, I'm here.

2274
02:06:23,790 --> 02:06:24,590
All right.

2275
02:06:26,870 --> 02:06:28,890
Yeah, I'll figure out how to get to me first.

2276
02:06:31,210 --> 02:06:32,350
God, there we go.

2277
02:06:32,950 --> 02:06:35,870
I did- okay, I'm gonna wait for that one guy to show up before anything.

2278
02:06:39,090 --> 02:06:39,410
Uh...

2279
02:06:42,090 --> 02:06:44,310
Yeah, fuck, I'm gonna wait for that one guy to show up.

2280
02:06:45,630 --> 02:06:47,390
I know you guys want to come over here.

2281
02:06:49,030 --> 02:06:50,350
Before I get out of the bush.

2282
02:06:50,910 --> 02:06:52,190
Wait, can I escape down there too?

2283
02:06:52,290 --> 02:06:53,050
Oh, I can!

2284
02:06:53,630 --> 02:06:55,410
Oh my god, to go downstairs anyway!

2285
02:06:56,490 --> 02:07:03,530
What the- I just want to make sure I don't get caught by some fucker.

2286
02:07:04,730 --> 02:07:06,070
I want to be sure I'm safe.

2287
02:07:07,630 --> 02:07:08,890
Yeah, there is one down there.

2288
02:07:08,910 --> 02:07:10,070
I have to go down there anyway.

2289
02:07:10,370 --> 02:07:10,930
This sucks.

2290
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:15,560
Where are they?

2291
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:20,360
The rock- the bush is calling.

2292
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:22,360
The bush is calling.

2293
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:26,920
The bush is calling for you!

2294
02:07:27,660 --> 02:07:29,160
Where are you?

2295
02:07:34,830 --> 02:07:36,890
The bush hungers!

2296
02:07:39,430 --> 02:07:41,330
I know you're here!

2297
02:07:46,030 --> 02:07:48,410
My god, where is that one guy?

2298
02:07:48,570 --> 02:07:49,730
Oh shit!

2299
02:07:54,530 --> 02:07:56,270
That's where he is.

2300
02:07:58,010 --> 02:07:59,030
Oh, yo.

2301
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:04,550
There we go.

2302
02:08:05,290 --> 02:08:06,870
That's fucking right.

2303
02:08:07,030 --> 02:08:08,190
No food for you.

2304
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:14,840
That's fucking right.

2305
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:16,460
Don't underestimate me.

2306
02:08:20,730 --> 02:08:21,640
Oh shit!

2307
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:22,460
Oh shit!

2308
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:23,080
I'm sorry!

2309
02:08:30,430 --> 02:08:31,350
Yo, yo.

2310
02:08:35,270 --> 02:08:37,790
I'm just gonna make sure they are all dead.

2311
02:08:41,390 --> 02:08:44,090
I don't think my ears are working anymore.

2312
02:08:50,450 --> 02:08:51,350
Ping, ping!

2313
02:08:51,970 --> 02:08:52,870
Okay, there we go.

2314
02:08:53,770 --> 02:08:55,470
I know there's one more guy.

2315
02:08:55,550 --> 02:08:56,470
Oh, they all ran away.

2316
02:08:56,570 --> 02:08:57,130
That's good.

2317
02:08:57,790 --> 02:08:58,910
Am I safe now?

2318
02:08:59,050 --> 02:09:00,130
Can I go home?

2319
02:09:00,370 --> 02:09:04,230
Can I go home now?

2320
02:09:04,410 --> 02:09:06,570
Can I move from this spot?

2321
02:09:08,910 --> 02:09:10,910
Am I allowed to move?

2322
02:09:11,370 --> 02:09:13,590
Please, I just want to leave.

2323
02:09:16,010 --> 02:09:17,590
We have achieved one.

2324
02:09:17,870 --> 02:09:18,930
I can't help myself.

2325
02:09:19,030 --> 02:09:19,990
I keep headshotting.

2326
02:09:21,070 --> 02:09:23,010
I couldn't help it, guys.

2327
02:09:24,590 --> 02:09:26,810
The gamer in me keeps wanting to headshot.

2328
02:09:27,490 --> 02:09:31,950
And also, not a lot of people failed November, so like, they were safe.

2329
02:09:33,610 --> 02:09:34,770
They got lucky.

2330
02:09:35,870 --> 02:09:37,730
Only one guy failed November.

2331
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:43,960
Oh my god.

2332
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:45,780
Hey, I said ballshot mission.

2333
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:49,460
I said ballshot missions.

2334
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:57,020
Please let me go!

2335
02:10:02,900 --> 02:10:05,840
I wanna leave the bush!

2336
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:09,000
Oh my god, I accidentally used my bandage.

2337
02:10:09,100 --> 02:10:09,340
Fuck.

2338
02:10:09,340 --> 02:10:10,440
I was trying to throw rocks.

2339
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:13,360
Let me leave!

2340
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:15,040
Oh my god, please.

2341
02:10:15,660 --> 02:10:17,740
I legit, I just wanna...

2342
02:10:24,070 --> 02:10:25,630
I'm gonna shoot this guy.

2343
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:35,190
Okay, wait a minute.

2344
02:10:42,330 --> 02:10:47,950
Okay, okay, to be fair, that guy was asking for it right there.

2345
02:10:51,050 --> 02:10:57,090
He was, he was like, okay, okay, you can't say he was not asking for that.

2346
02:10:57,510 --> 02:11:00,730
You did not see him?

2347
02:11:10,630 --> 02:11:11,950
There we go.

2348
02:11:12,710 --> 02:11:14,290
Jesus Christ.

2349
02:11:19,550 --> 02:11:21,590
God, how do I get down?

2350
02:11:24,410 --> 02:11:25,170
Eh.

2351
02:11:28,660 --> 02:11:30,780
There's like two over there.

2352
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:32,840
I don't know where, so I'm just gonna...

2353
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:36,340
Oh my god, I can't run from there.

2354
02:11:40,820 --> 02:11:42,720
He literally showed his butt.

2355
02:11:43,700 --> 02:11:45,520
Guys, can you really blame me?

2356
02:11:51,450 --> 02:11:54,090
He showed his butt to me and I was like, whoa.

2357
02:11:56,030 --> 02:11:57,090
Gotta take that shot.

2358
02:11:57,970 --> 02:11:58,770
Okay, I can do this.

2359
02:11:58,930 --> 02:11:59,270
Watch this.

2360
02:11:59,270 --> 02:12:00,890
Three, two, one.

2361
02:12:02,130 --> 02:12:03,230
Oh my god!

2362
02:12:03,230 --> 02:12:03,590
What?

2363
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:08,820
Okay, okay, I had no angle.

2364
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:13,080
There we go.

2365
02:12:13,660 --> 02:12:14,220
Oh, wait, what?

2366
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:14,740
He lives?

2367
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:17,100
He lives again?

2368
02:12:18,460 --> 02:12:19,160
There we... what?

2369
02:12:23,370 --> 02:12:25,830
The camera got... that's not fair!

2370
02:12:26,030 --> 02:12:27,010
I got fucked over

2371
02:12:30,970 --> 02:12:31,770
by...

2372
02:12:31,770 --> 02:12:32,890
the camera!

2373
02:12:33,090 --> 02:12:34,470
It was the camera's fault.

2374
02:12:36,630 --> 02:12:38,230
I could've been like...

2375
02:12:38,900 --> 02:12:40,970
That helmet protects the shit out of him.

2376
02:12:41,190 --> 02:12:45,590
Holy shit, the strongest helmet in fucking Germany.

2377
02:12:50,700 --> 02:12:51,580
All right.

2378
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:55,620
All right, we finally can finally get to walk downstairs.

2379
02:12:56,180 --> 02:13:00,660
Oh my god, that was the hardest way to get downstairs possible.

2380
02:13:04,190 --> 02:13:06,650
And those helmets are actually bulletproof.

2381
02:13:06,730 --> 02:13:08,430
It's like helmet guys, always wear your helmet.

2382
02:13:09,330 --> 02:13:10,150
It works.

2383
02:13:12,230 --> 02:13:16,690
All right, I think... I think... oh wait, yeah, I forgot we're in Italy.

2384
02:13:17,530 --> 02:13:18,370
We're in Italy.

2385
02:13:20,150 --> 02:13:22,050
Well, I have to kill like Nazis.

2386
02:13:22,970 --> 02:13:25,710
So of course like my mind went to Germany.

2387
02:13:27,650 --> 02:13:31,470
All right, I think I killed everybody here so we can leave.

2388
02:13:33,750 --> 02:13:34,150
Hello.

2389
02:13:35,150 --> 02:13:36,710
Oh, this is the guy I killed.

2390
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:44,000
All right, nice.

2391
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:45,280
All right, get over here.

2392
02:13:45,340 --> 02:13:46,240
I'm taking you with me.

2393
02:13:46,580 --> 02:13:47,860
You're gonna be my trophy.

2394
02:13:48,260 --> 02:13:49,960
So they'll know I did it.

2395
02:13:51,300 --> 02:13:53,240
They'll know I'm bringing you with me.

2396
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:55,120
Come on.

2397
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,660
I'll get a heart attack if I...

2398
02:13:57,660 --> 02:13:59,200
like, sprint too much.

2399
02:13:59,260 --> 02:14:00,420
You're coming with me.

2400
02:14:11,350 --> 02:14:12,470
Oh my god, we did it!

2401
02:14:13,610 --> 02:14:14,990
We finally did it!

2402
02:14:14,990 --> 02:14:16,430
Oh, we don't care about the camera.

2403
02:14:16,550 --> 02:14:18,390
The camera does not matter to me.

2404
02:14:18,390 --> 02:14:20,770
I swear...

2405
02:14:20,770 --> 02:14:22,950
Schmidt was literally the easiest one.

2406
02:14:24,610 --> 02:14:25,290
Schmitty...

2407
02:14:25,290 --> 02:14:29,270
Schmitty was the... was the easiest general of all of them.

2408
02:14:29,470 --> 02:14:31,430
Because he literally just walked outside.

2409
02:14:31,730 --> 02:14:33,630
And just like let me kill him.

2410
02:14:34,070 --> 02:14:36,250
All right, now it's time, chat.

2411
02:14:36,950 --> 02:14:38,710
Now... now that I've learned...

2412
02:14:40,510 --> 02:14:41,590
It's time.

2413
02:14:46,470 --> 02:14:48,830
Schmitty was asking for it.

2414
02:14:51,610 --> 02:14:54,310
Damn, this is the moment of truth.

2415
02:14:55,150 --> 02:14:56,010
All right.

2416
02:14:58,450 --> 02:14:59,170
Here we go.

2417
02:14:59,290 --> 02:14:59,490
Yep.

2418
02:14:59,910 --> 02:15:00,590
All right.

2419
02:15:00,910 --> 02:15:02,550
Is this the loadout we're going for?

2420
02:15:03,170 --> 02:15:04,550
Guys, is there a better...

2421
02:15:05,450 --> 02:15:06,930
Is there a better loadout?

2422
02:15:07,070 --> 02:15:09,010
Should we... is this the one we're going for, chat?

2423
02:15:13,190 --> 02:15:14,710
Do we get any other gun?

2424
02:15:21,780 --> 02:15:23,820
Do we have...

2425
02:15:25,880 --> 02:15:26,900
We have...

2426
02:15:27,240 --> 02:15:29,020
Springfield, Carmen...

2427
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:31,260
38...

2428
02:15:31,260 --> 02:15:37,200
Carbine, Gerard, Rosmarc, Winchester, Swedish, and Rifle.

2429
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:43,960
Springfield?

2430
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:47,120
Oh my god, everybody's voting for different ways.

2431
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:49,480
Which... oh, M1?

2432
02:15:49,620 --> 02:15:51,800
Everyone says... I saw a lot of M1.

2433
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:52,820
Where's M1?

2434
02:15:54,060 --> 02:15:56,380
Okay, but we have several M1s though.

2435
02:15:58,180 --> 02:16:00,580
The Gerard, we have M1...

2436
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:03,140
Gerard, M1 Carbine...

2437
02:16:04,220 --> 02:16:06,920
M1... M1 903 Springfield.

2438
02:16:08,380 --> 02:16:11,000
M1 Gerard, this one?

2439
02:16:17,900 --> 02:16:18,760
Who are the...

2440
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:24,920
Okay, all right.

2441
02:16:25,120 --> 02:16:28,640
And then our other guns is that... do we stay all over this?

2442
02:16:31,020 --> 02:16:33,160
Oh, it makes a ping noise!

2443
02:16:33,440 --> 02:16:35,900
Oh, wait, that's fun!

2444
02:16:36,900 --> 02:16:38,680
Oh, we can buy items now.

2445
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:39,940
Should we buy more?

2446
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:41,820
Suppress rifle.

2447
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:43,880
Oh, we should buy suppress rifle ammo.

2448
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:45,780
Use for quiet air.

2449
02:16:48,940 --> 02:16:51,340
Okay, should we buy anything?

2450
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:54,460
Buy mines?

2451
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:55,840
Oh, you're right.

2452
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:56,740
We should.

2453
02:16:58,020 --> 02:16:59,100
Holy shit!

2454
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:00,200
Okay, that's fine.

2455
02:17:00,260 --> 02:17:01,240
We'll find more mines.

2456
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:04,660
All right, here we go.

2457
02:17:04,860 --> 02:17:09,960
All right, we will get our... we will not end until we get the ball shot.

2458
02:17:11,580 --> 02:17:14,300
I don't care how long it takes.

2459
02:17:14,480 --> 02:17:18,720
We don't end this game until we get the shot.

2460
02:17:30,990 --> 02:17:32,490
An island to the north of Crete.

2461
02:17:34,310 --> 02:17:36,510
Nothing here but rocks and seabirds.

2462
02:17:37,150 --> 02:17:38,130
The shot!

2463
02:17:41,710 --> 02:17:48,870
The nazis are determined to use all their units to cut up Red Squadron, which is the main enemy of the Red Army and the NATO base.

2464
02:17:51,090 --> 02:17:55,690
Our informant in the German navy says the new base is being built on Sundari.

2465
02:17:56,510 --> 02:17:58,870
British intelligence want it neutralized.

2466
02:18:00,990 --> 02:18:05,270
That means assassinating Admiral Herman Richter, the base commander.

2467
02:18:06,250 --> 02:18:09,450
Any damage I can inflict along the way would be a definite bonus.

2468
02:18:11,710 --> 02:18:15,510
Fortunately, our informant has left me some resources in one of the seaforts.

2469
02:18:16,190 --> 02:18:17,250
I reckon I might need them.

2470
02:18:19,270 --> 02:18:22,290
What happens next could change the course of the war.

2471
02:18:22,290 --> 02:18:24,030
I'm not throwing away my shot!

2472
02:18:27,290 --> 02:18:30,450
That shot is the only reason why I want to play this game.

2473
02:18:33,830 --> 02:18:34,810
We'll practice.

2474
02:18:34,970 --> 02:18:36,950
We'll practice on all the other guys here.

2475
02:18:37,270 --> 02:18:39,130
Guys, we're gonna practice.

2476
02:18:39,510 --> 02:18:40,210
Don't worry.

2477
02:18:45,250 --> 02:18:48,650
We'll practice on all the other men before we get to him.

2478
02:18:49,330 --> 02:18:50,790
Wait, but where is he?

2479
02:18:51,350 --> 02:18:52,410
Admiral Richter?

2480
02:18:57,090 --> 02:18:59,390
Okay, where the fuck is he?

2481
02:18:59,390 --> 02:18:59,690
I don't see it.

2482
02:19:03,010 --> 02:19:06,630
I think this game is- it's like it's steam sale right now.

2483
02:19:06,730 --> 02:19:08,450
So it's a hundred percent worth it.

2484
02:19:08,870 --> 02:19:11,230
I bought this yesterday during the steam sale.

2485
02:19:11,690 --> 02:19:12,190
Look at that.

2486
02:19:12,690 --> 02:19:15,270
The Germans have got themselves an impressive operation.

2487
02:19:18,230 --> 02:19:18,790
Okay.

2488
02:19:22,190 --> 02:19:23,350
Where are the others?

2489
02:19:32,250 --> 02:19:32,810
Okay.

2490
02:19:38,930 --> 02:19:40,810
Oh, wait, I can take this shot.

2491
02:19:45,360 --> 02:19:46,600
Did it hit that?

2492
02:19:47,360 --> 02:19:49,920
No, what the fuck did I hit?

2493
02:19:51,260 --> 02:19:53,360
What the fuck?!

2494
02:19:53,360 --> 02:19:54,600
What did I hit?

2495
02:19:57,300 --> 02:19:58,780
Oh my god, ping.

2496
02:19:58,980 --> 02:20:00,400
God, stupid win!

2497
02:20:02,340 --> 02:20:04,680
Stupid fucking win got me again.

2498
02:20:08,310 --> 02:20:09,650
I hate the win.

2499
02:20:09,950 --> 02:20:12,530
I hate the win so much.

2500
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:18,500
What is this?

2501
02:20:18,660 --> 02:20:19,540
The Q-E?

2502
02:20:21,960 --> 02:20:23,180
Wait, what is it?

2503
02:20:23,360 --> 02:20:24,960
What is this thing that I'm doing?

2504
02:20:25,160 --> 02:20:25,440
Oh!

2505
02:20:28,850 --> 02:20:30,370
Like, what is this thing?

2506
02:20:39,870 --> 02:20:41,030
God, it's fine.

2507
02:20:41,130 --> 02:20:42,090
There's no win here.

2508
02:20:42,770 --> 02:20:44,690
There's no win here!

2509
02:20:47,270 --> 02:20:51,930
What's the- a changing- Adjusts the fire range?

2510
02:20:53,730 --> 02:20:54,290
Oh!

2511
02:20:54,860 --> 02:20:59,070
So like, I can't adjust it though, but what does that do?

2512
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:14,120
God fucking- okay, we can do this.

2513
02:21:14,500 --> 02:21:15,120
No!

2514
02:21:16,460 --> 02:21:17,080
No!

2515
02:21:18,060 --> 02:21:19,280
I still got him though!

2516
02:21:32,910 --> 02:21:34,610
Okay, that's fucking right.

2517
02:21:34,670 --> 02:21:35,530
I still got him.

2518
02:21:37,890 --> 02:21:39,890
Okay, we gotta practice ball shots.

2519
02:21:41,110 --> 02:21:42,590
Oh no, they saw me.

2520
02:21:42,630 --> 02:21:43,030
No!

2521
02:21:46,010 --> 02:21:46,810
No!

2522
02:21:48,350 --> 02:21:49,230
It's okay.

2523
02:21:49,630 --> 02:21:50,550
We're okay.

2524
02:21:51,630 --> 02:21:53,550
I need to practice the ball shot.

2525
02:21:57,750 --> 02:21:59,890
Wait, he gets up?

2526
02:22:00,990 --> 02:22:02,530
You get up?

2527
02:22:03,170 --> 02:22:04,690
You get up?

2528
02:22:05,030 --> 02:22:07,450
What is wrong with you?

2529
02:22:14,020 --> 02:22:15,320
Bro, he got up!

2530
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:17,680
Oh shit.

2531
02:22:18,120 --> 02:22:18,640
Oh shit.

2532
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:19,040
Okay.

2533
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:23,640
Oh no.

2534
02:22:25,060 --> 02:22:27,100
Dude feels no pain.

2535
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:29,560
Like, what is wrong with him?

2536
02:22:29,580 --> 02:22:31,080
How do you get up?

2537
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:36,480
This has- this guy has to be-

2538
02:22:39,670 --> 02:22:42,230
Okay, that was definitely not 500.

2539
02:22:42,570 --> 02:22:44,490
How do I know what the range is?

2540
02:22:51,390 --> 02:22:53,450
Like, I'm trying to figure out what the range is.

2541
02:22:53,530 --> 02:22:54,670
Oh shit, I hit that.

2542
02:22:59,250 --> 02:23:00,170
Adrenaline Park.

2543
02:23:00,370 --> 02:23:06,630
Oh, if I mark him with the- There we go.

2544
02:23:07,030 --> 02:23:08,430
You do not get up.

2545
02:23:08,790 --> 02:23:10,930
You do not get up.

2546
02:23:13,450 --> 02:23:19,470
All right, guys, I don't know why I'm learning with the Fuhrer with this.

2547
02:23:21,870 --> 02:23:23,370
There we go, we're fine now.

2548
02:23:23,830 --> 02:23:25,510
Now they don't know.

2549
02:23:25,510 --> 02:23:25,930
Oh.

2550
02:23:26,970 --> 02:23:27,450
Okay.

2551
02:23:29,510 --> 02:23:31,050
Okay, now I figured it out.

2552
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:39,020
Now I figured it out.

2553
02:23:39,140 --> 02:23:40,020
Now I win this.

2554
02:23:42,460 --> 02:23:44,220
Come on, get over here.

2555
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:48,000
Wait, I can go prone?

2556
02:23:51,930 --> 02:23:52,730
Wait, no.

2557
02:23:54,790 --> 02:23:55,830
Oh, come on.

2558
02:23:55,950 --> 02:23:57,590
Oh, he was just right there.

2559
02:23:58,850 --> 02:24:00,830
He was right there.

2560
02:24:00,830 --> 02:24:05,630
He was right there.

2561
02:24:06,010 --> 02:24:08,250
I could have taken the shot.

2562
02:24:09,390 --> 02:24:10,810
Where is he going?

2563
02:24:10,950 --> 02:24:11,670
I don't know.

2564
02:24:15,470 --> 02:24:17,090
I want to take his loot.

2565
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:27,060
I should actually heal though.

2566
02:24:29,380 --> 02:24:32,460
I feel like I was- I definitely lost a lot of blood there.

2567
02:24:32,480 --> 02:24:33,320
From that.

2568
02:24:38,990 --> 02:24:39,670
Okay.

2569
02:24:41,870 --> 02:24:42,990
Oh, what?

2570
02:24:52,050 --> 02:24:54,150
This Fuhrer.

2571
02:25:02,860 --> 02:25:04,960
Where the fuck was he?

2572
02:25:16,470 --> 02:25:17,850
That's not near me, right?

2573
02:25:18,270 --> 02:25:18,950
I'll be fine, right?

2574
02:25:19,990 --> 02:25:22,210
I'll be fine right here.

2575
02:25:24,370 --> 02:25:25,950
Oh, he's gonna bleed out.

2576
02:25:26,230 --> 02:25:27,130
Don't worry, bro.

2577
02:25:28,710 --> 02:25:29,730
Don't worry, bro.

2578
02:25:29,770 --> 02:25:30,650
I'll finish the job.

2579
02:25:31,430 --> 02:25:33,190
How are you still alive?

2580
02:25:36,530 --> 02:25:39,170
Okay, now I'll finish the job.

2581
02:25:44,350 --> 02:25:45,230
Is that it?

2582
02:25:45,330 --> 02:25:46,250
Where's the other guy?

2583
02:25:46,430 --> 02:25:49,530
Where was the guy that shot me from 20 miles away?

2584
02:25:52,670 --> 02:25:54,230
There you are.

2585
02:25:55,390 --> 02:25:58,550
Oh, there you- There you are.

2586
02:25:59,390 --> 02:25:59,730
Okay.

2587
02:26:00,430 --> 02:26:01,170
I see you.

2588
02:26:01,190 --> 02:26:01,290
I see you.

2589
02:26:06,740 --> 02:26:08,220
That's fucking right.

2590
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:09,540
That's right.

2591
02:26:09,700 --> 02:26:11,040
Sit down.

2592
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:14,540
Sit your fucking ass down.

2593
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:16,720
This one I'll just headshot you.

2594
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:17,740
Ezuki.

2595
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:19,760
The real sniper?

2596
02:26:20,340 --> 02:26:21,660
See that again.

2597
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:24,220
See that again.

2598
02:26:24,520 --> 02:26:25,820
The what sniper?

2599
02:26:26,660 --> 02:26:27,600
The what?

2600
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:29,880
The what?

2601
02:26:32,100 --> 02:26:35,920
You mean the guy that's fucking dead?

2602
02:26:36,120 --> 02:26:37,700
There he is.

2603
02:26:43,540 --> 02:26:47,020
The dead sniper now.

2604
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:54,960
That's fucking right.

2605
02:26:56,440 --> 02:26:58,300
Fucking real sniper.

2606
02:27:03,290 --> 02:27:03,850
Alright.

2607
02:27:05,470 --> 02:27:07,010
There's another bush right there.

2608
02:27:10,170 --> 02:27:11,890
They saw me, didn't they?

2609
02:27:13,710 --> 02:27:14,790
They saw me.

2610
02:27:16,970 --> 02:27:20,890
But did they see me go into- Did they see me go into this bush?

2611
02:27:23,510 --> 02:27:24,330
Wait, what?

2612
02:27:25,010 --> 02:27:25,990
What was that?

2613
02:27:27,310 --> 02:27:29,230
Wait, did they call for reinforcements?

2614
02:27:30,230 --> 02:27:31,470
OH SHIT!

2615
02:27:33,830 --> 02:27:34,430
OH!

2616
02:27:34,930 --> 02:27:35,650
OH!

2617
02:27:36,130 --> 02:27:37,070
What the

2618
02:27:41,900 --> 02:27:43,180
f - I'm okay.

2619
02:27:45,700 --> 02:27:47,180
I'm okay, guys.

2620
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:50,040
It's okay.

2621
02:27:50,460 --> 02:27:51,180
See, I lived.

2622
02:27:52,680 --> 02:27:53,720
I lived, guys.

2623
02:27:55,160 --> 02:27:56,040
I lived.

2624
02:27:56,940 --> 02:27:58,280
They got the wrong guy.

2625
02:28:01,140 --> 02:28:02,980
There's literally one guy left.

2626
02:28:02,980 --> 02:28:04,520
I'm trying to figure out where he is.

2627
02:28:05,220 --> 02:28:06,100
Oh, there he is.

2628
02:28:14,810 --> 02:28:16,430
I didn't shoot him in the balls.

2629
02:28:16,710 --> 02:28:18,450
I shot him in the goddamn liver.

2630
02:28:18,930 --> 02:28:20,210
It's not the same.

2631
02:28:20,870 --> 02:28:23,510
It's not the same when it's not the balls.

2632
02:28:25,510 --> 02:28:27,530
I need to practice!

2633
02:28:32,530 --> 02:28:34,010
That's fine, they're all dead now.

2634
02:28:39,460 --> 02:28:39,860
Ding!

2635
02:28:43,890 --> 02:28:44,810
Oh, shit.

2636
02:28:48,470 --> 02:28:50,750
Guys, I fucked up the self part.

2637
02:28:50,870 --> 02:28:51,810
Did you guys notice that?

2638
02:28:54,050 --> 02:28:57,590
Is it noticeable that I fucked up?

2639
02:28:58,570 --> 02:29:00,510
It's okay, we can recover from this!

2640
02:29:01,630 --> 02:29:03,450
Guys, we can recover!

2641
02:29:05,210 --> 02:29:06,910
We can fix this.

2642
02:29:07,550 --> 02:29:08,630
Very easily.

2643
02:29:11,990 --> 02:29:13,230
Very easily.

2644
02:29:13,470 --> 02:29:14,550
It is fixable!

2645
02:29:15,650 --> 02:29:18,710
It is so fixable, chat.

2646
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:20,550
It is so fixable.

2647
02:29:21,610 --> 02:29:22,530
We'll be fine.

2648
02:29:25,350 --> 02:29:26,910
We'll be fine.

2649
02:29:27,790 --> 02:29:29,150
If you don't know, I'm here.

2650
02:29:30,470 --> 02:29:32,450
I can start going inside now.

2651
02:29:36,730 --> 02:29:38,010
Okay, watch this.

2652
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:51,240
Okay, okay.

2653
02:29:52,800 --> 02:29:53,520
Okay.

2654
02:29:54,940 --> 02:29:56,040
Watch this.

2655
02:29:56,820 --> 02:29:58,440
It's so cool!

2656
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:01,120
We did it!

2657
02:30:02,900 --> 02:30:04,120
Nothing else.

2658
02:30:04,420 --> 02:30:05,480
We did it, guys.

2659
02:30:05,780 --> 02:30:06,840
Did you guys see it?

2660
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:09,460
Oh my god, that jump was insane!

2661
02:30:09,860 --> 02:30:11,620
That was an insane jump!

2662
02:30:12,420 --> 02:30:15,680
Oh my god, first try too!

2663
02:30:16,380 --> 02:30:19,740
She's fucking insane at this game.

2664
02:30:22,440 --> 02:30:24,360
First try as well?

2665
02:30:24,520 --> 02:30:26,740
How the fuck does she do it?

2666
02:30:33,340 --> 02:30:34,300
Where are they going?

2667
02:30:37,440 --> 02:30:39,680
Holy shit, how does she do it?

2668
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:42,200
Actually fucking crazy.

2669
02:30:49,930 --> 02:30:51,750
There was a guy heading over this way.

2670
02:30:57,460 --> 02:30:58,980
Oh my god, where?

2671
02:31:07,610 --> 02:31:09,030
Okay, this is safe.

2672
02:31:11,590 --> 02:31:12,750
It's safe so far.

2673
02:31:15,450 --> 02:31:17,050
Where the fuck are the supplies?

2674
02:31:25,060 --> 02:31:27,800
I know there's like several people here too.

2675
02:31:29,820 --> 02:31:32,060
Yeah, this is like scary.

2676
02:31:33,220 --> 02:31:34,440
It's like, where are they?

2677
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:35,820
Okay, there's two up top.

2678
02:31:42,230 --> 02:31:42,730
See?

2679
02:31:43,090 --> 02:31:44,010
Nothing happened.

2680
02:31:44,310 --> 02:31:45,970
They're like, oh, it was just the wind.

2681
02:31:46,930 --> 02:31:47,970
I'm like, yeah, the wind.

2682
02:31:48,810 --> 02:31:49,410
See?

2683
02:31:49,950 --> 02:31:51,050
They're going back!

2684
02:31:51,250 --> 02:31:52,870
They think it's just the wind!

2685
02:32:02,850 --> 02:32:03,670
Wait, what?

2686
02:32:04,290 --> 02:32:05,230
Oh shit, oops.

2687
02:32:06,290 --> 02:32:06,630
Oops.

2688
02:32:07,090 --> 02:32:09,010
It was just the wind, guys.

2689
02:32:11,330 --> 02:32:13,930
It said 58, that should've hit.

2690
02:32:20,490 --> 02:32:21,790
That must've hit.

2691
02:32:23,850 --> 02:32:27,230
Oh, there we go, that's what I like to see.

2692
02:32:27,830 --> 02:32:28,310
Okay.

2693
02:32:34,620 --> 02:32:35,020
Okay.

2694
02:32:41,790 --> 02:32:43,270
Okay, I can't get this guy.

2695
02:32:44,450 --> 02:32:46,710
Where the fuck would the supplies be?

2696
02:32:46,830 --> 02:32:48,570
I guess it would be on the other side?

2697
02:32:49,430 --> 02:32:51,190
Okay, but we'll get rid of these guys first.

2698
02:32:52,450 --> 02:32:53,790
Wish they'll stand still.

2699
02:32:58,310 --> 02:33:02,570
How would I hit- God damn it.

2700
02:33:02,750 --> 02:33:03,470
It was close.

2701
02:33:03,470 --> 02:33:04,470
Ding.

2702
02:33:07,130 --> 02:33:09,330
The stomach is almost the ball.

2703
02:33:10,370 --> 02:33:12,230
It's like almost there.

2704
02:33:20,730 --> 02:33:21,930
I can go this way.

2705
02:33:24,330 --> 02:33:26,870
What the fuck was that?

2706
02:33:30,110 --> 02:33:31,030
Oh,

2707
02:33:34,510 --> 02:33:36,250
wait, they saw me?

2708
02:33:38,530 --> 02:33:38,990
How?

2709
02:33:39,670 --> 02:33:41,670
It was another sniper!

2710
02:33:42,450 --> 02:33:44,950
Oh, that was a different sniper?

2711
02:33:45,790 --> 02:33:46,830
Where are you?

2712
02:33:50,850 --> 02:33:51,330
Okay.

2713
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:58,560
There's another sniper.

2714
02:33:58,840 --> 02:33:59,560
Okay, now I know.

2715
02:34:00,780 --> 02:34:03,040
I didn't realize that meant sniper.

2716
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
That's not fair!

2717
02:34:19,820 --> 02:34:21,480
That's not fair!

2718
02:34:22,060 --> 02:34:23,780
The stupid wind!

2719
02:34:26,020 --> 02:34:27,440
Okay, that's fine.

2720
02:34:29,240 --> 02:34:30,720
No, don't close it!

2721
02:34:30,760 --> 02:34:30,960
No!

2722
02:34:31,720 --> 02:34:32,380
No!

2723
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:35,140
No!

2724
02:34:36,060 --> 02:34:37,180
That's not good!

2725
02:34:37,420 --> 02:34:39,400
You know what that means?

2726
02:34:50,570 --> 02:34:51,930
There you go.

2727
02:34:53,030 --> 02:34:55,090
We still have another chance.

2728
02:34:55,090 --> 02:34:55,870
That's what he said.

2729
02:34:59,110 --> 02:35:01,430
They're not escorting him.

2730
02:35:03,890 --> 02:35:07,570
There's no way they will escort him away from me.

2731
02:35:15,850 --> 02:35:18,770
They cannot escort him away from me.

2732
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:25,860
Where is he anyway?

2733
02:35:26,120 --> 02:35:27,220
Where would he be?

2734
02:35:31,990 --> 02:35:34,230
I refuse to let him go.

2735
02:35:44,610 --> 02:35:45,890
This should be it.

2736
02:35:47,570 --> 02:35:48,530
Come on.

2737
02:35:48,610 --> 02:35:49,270
Come on.

2738
02:35:49,310 --> 02:35:49,810
No!

2739
02:35:50,550 --> 02:35:52,030
I was so close!

2740
02:35:52,450 --> 02:35:54,530
I was so close!

2741
02:35:58,570 --> 02:36:00,190
Is it like this base?

2742
02:36:00,330 --> 02:36:01,590
The one I'm in right now?

2743
02:36:03,390 --> 02:36:04,350
This one?

2744
02:36:04,490 --> 02:36:05,610
Or this one?

2745
02:36:06,430 --> 02:36:07,110
Oh, shit!

2746
02:36:07,210 --> 02:36:07,430
Wait!

2747
02:36:07,430 --> 02:36:08,270
He's in here!

2748
02:36:08,430 --> 02:36:09,030
He's right here!

2749
02:36:09,290 --> 02:36:10,190
Oh, shit!

2750
02:36:10,270 --> 02:36:11,310
What am I doing here?

2751
02:36:12,570 --> 02:36:13,930
Okay, this is practice.

2752
02:36:14,770 --> 02:36:15,170
Alright.

2753
02:36:17,350 --> 02:36:19,250
I gotta get the other sniper though.

2754
02:36:19,250 --> 02:36:21,090
I can't figure out where the other sniper is.

2755
02:36:29,570 --> 02:36:32,070
Where is this other sniper that got me?

2756
02:36:33,230 --> 02:36:34,150
This fucker!

2757
02:36:34,190 --> 02:36:35,330
I hate this guy!

2758
02:36:36,450 --> 02:36:37,490
Holy fuck!

2759
02:36:47,910 --> 02:36:50,570
Okay, I wanted to get him out of the way first.

2760
02:36:55,250 --> 02:36:55,650
Okay.

2761
02:36:57,150 --> 02:36:58,130
Let's get down.

2762
02:37:02,670 --> 02:37:04,230
Where the fuck is the supplies?

2763
02:37:08,650 --> 02:37:09,410
Yeah, I know!

2764
02:37:09,510 --> 02:37:10,350
But where is it?

2765
02:37:10,650 --> 02:37:11,190
Is it this?

2766
02:37:11,250 --> 02:37:12,010
Oh, we found it!

2767
02:37:12,090 --> 02:37:12,290
Nice!

2768
02:37:12,410 --> 02:37:12,590
Okay.

2769
02:37:16,570 --> 02:37:16,950
Alright.

2770
02:37:17,390 --> 02:37:18,650
It's time to figure out how to get there.

2771
02:37:19,590 --> 02:37:19,950
Okay.

2772
02:37:20,710 --> 02:37:21,890
This is a little difficult.

2773
02:37:22,690 --> 02:37:25,850
We're in difficult territory because we have to get to the...

2774
02:37:25,850 --> 02:37:27,670
We have to get here.

2775
02:37:28,630 --> 02:37:30,470
Like, to find him.

2776
02:37:30,890 --> 02:37:31,890
Like, how?

2777
02:37:34,670 --> 02:37:36,450
This is a big area.

2778
02:37:36,970 --> 02:37:38,890
This is a big area.

2779
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:45,160
Alright.

2780
02:37:46,980 --> 02:37:48,800
We gotta figure out how to get there.

2781
02:37:49,660 --> 02:37:51,260
To kill Hitler right here.

2782
02:37:51,260 --> 02:37:56,680
We gotta figure out first how the fuck do we get there.

2783
02:38:00,720 --> 02:38:02,650
Now the actual hard part.

2784
02:38:04,550 --> 02:38:05,450
Happy Thanksgiving.

2785
02:38:09,050 --> 02:38:10,630
Happy Thanksgiving.

2786
02:38:12,010 --> 02:38:14,710
This is where the real game begins.

2787
02:38:19,670 --> 02:38:21,850
He's already there?!

2788
02:38:23,210 --> 02:38:24,110
Oh, fuck!

2789
02:38:24,370 --> 02:38:26,350
Oh, I fucked around way too much!

2790
02:38:28,810 --> 02:38:30,370
Happy American Thanksgiving.

2791
02:38:30,610 --> 02:38:31,730
The best way to celebrate.

2792
02:38:35,530 --> 02:38:38,150
Wait, he's already doing a tour?!

2793
02:38:39,590 --> 02:38:41,890
I'm still trying to figure out how to get to him!

2794
02:38:48,860 --> 02:38:49,380
Okay.

2795
02:38:50,600 --> 02:38:52,140
How long does he tour for?

2796
02:38:53,220 --> 02:38:54,300
Does he leave?

2797
02:38:59,550 --> 02:39:00,590
It's time!

2798
02:39:00,750 --> 02:39:02,150
Oh, I gotta...

2799
02:39:02,150 --> 02:39:04,530
I gotta fucking...

2800
02:39:04,530 --> 02:39:09,410
Oh god,

2801
02:39:13,290 --> 02:39:13,590
okay.

2802
02:39:15,670 --> 02:39:17,770
Alright, I gotta figure out how to get there.

2803
02:39:20,310 --> 02:39:22,650
I'm booking it as fast as I can.

2804
02:39:24,850 --> 02:39:28,010
He stops touring at 19?!

2805
02:39:28,010 --> 02:39:29,090
Wait, why did he stop?

2806
02:39:29,910 --> 02:39:31,110
He stopped!

2807
02:39:46,030 --> 02:39:46,630
Okay.

2808
02:39:52,590 --> 02:39:54,130
Okay, I need to kill this guy.

2809
02:39:54,250 --> 02:39:54,910
That's a sniper.

2810
02:40:13,390 --> 02:40:13,990
No!

2811
02:40:14,430 --> 02:40:15,890
I had to reload!

2812
02:40:16,630 --> 02:40:17,630
I had to...

2813
02:40:17,630 --> 02:40:18,210
No!

2814
02:40:18,850 --> 02:40:19,950
I just tried...

2815
02:40:20,470 --> 02:40:22,170
No, I was trying to reload!

2816
02:40:23,110 --> 02:40:25,770
Oh my god, I hate this.

2817
02:40:26,130 --> 02:40:29,070
I was trying to reload, my god.

2818
02:40:29,310 --> 02:40:31,170
Oh my god, which way was it?

2819
02:40:31,710 --> 02:40:33,510
Okay, I'm gonna try this again.

2820
02:40:33,510 --> 02:40:35,370
Why did you turn over?

2821
02:40:36,170 --> 02:40:39,610
I wanted to hit him from above, but I fell.

2822
02:40:41,470 --> 02:40:42,850
No, it wasn't a sound.

2823
02:40:42,990 --> 02:40:43,850
What are you talking about?

2824
02:40:44,030 --> 02:40:46,090
Like, I can't do it from here!

2825
02:40:48,710 --> 02:40:49,290
Okay.

2826
02:40:50,950 --> 02:40:52,490
I wanted to headshot him.

2827
02:40:52,530 --> 02:40:53,990
I thought it'd be cool.

2828
02:40:55,410 --> 02:40:56,530
I'm gonna shoot his arm.

2829
02:40:58,950 --> 02:40:59,510
Fuck.

2830
02:40:59,690 --> 02:41:00,210
No!

2831
02:41:00,910 --> 02:41:02,950
Do you know what that means?

2832
02:41:07,790 --> 02:41:09,190
It's a message!

2833
02:41:10,070 --> 02:41:11,450
It's a message!

2834
02:41:12,190 --> 02:41:13,370
I had to...

2835
02:41:13,370 --> 02:41:15,330
I had to send him...

2836
02:41:15,330 --> 02:41:16,170
I will kill him.

2837
02:41:16,590 --> 02:41:18,050
I will... this is my...

2838
02:41:18,050 --> 02:41:19,790
I don't care about Hitler anymore.

2839
02:41:20,110 --> 02:41:21,990
I need to kill this guy in particular.

2840
02:41:21,990 --> 02:41:22,130
What?

2841
02:41:35,060 --> 02:41:36,620
How do I shoulder swap?

2842
02:41:39,220 --> 02:41:40,320
I don't remember how.

2843
02:41:41,800 --> 02:41:43,200
How do you shoulder swap?

2844
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:52,180
I don't remember.

2845
02:41:52,400 --> 02:41:53,480
I need to check the commands.

2846
02:41:54,100 --> 02:41:54,900
This is my turn.

2847
02:41:55,040 --> 02:41:58,220
I would specifically look for the command to shoulder swap.

2848
02:41:58,840 --> 02:42:00,400
Oh, it's untoggled.

2849
02:42:00,420 --> 02:42:00,780
Okay.

2850
02:42:01,020 --> 02:42:01,760
Shoulder aim.

2851
02:42:02,140 --> 02:42:02,660
Okay.

2852
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:08,380
Alright, we'll make it the right...

2853
02:42:08,900 --> 02:42:10,500
The right shift key.

2854
02:42:13,300 --> 02:42:14,160
Wait, what?

2855
02:42:14,740 --> 02:42:16,840
Oh no, it's the aim.

2856
02:42:17,100 --> 02:42:17,660
Wait, no.

2857
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:21,560
Wait, no, it doesn't swap it.

2858
02:42:21,700 --> 02:42:23,620
It just swaps it like the shoulder.

2859
02:42:26,420 --> 02:42:28,100
Pick up body, defuse.

2860
02:42:28,180 --> 02:42:29,320
Wait, they don't have it!

2861
02:42:30,500 --> 02:42:32,100
I don't... they don't have it!

2862
02:42:33,100 --> 02:42:34,720
Is it camera swap?

2863
02:42:35,940 --> 02:42:37,300
This is personal.

2864
02:42:44,760 --> 02:42:46,780
I will kill you.

2865
02:42:52,700 --> 02:42:54,020
I'm done.

2866
02:43:00,220 --> 02:43:02,160
That's all I want.

2867
02:43:06,040 --> 02:43:08,620
Okay, okay, I'll go different now.

2868
02:43:08,680 --> 02:43:10,300
I got what I wanted.

2869
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:12,460
Guys, I got...

2870
02:43:12,460 --> 02:43:14,320
Guys, I got what I wanted.

2871
02:43:14,400 --> 02:43:15,280
I'm fine now.

2872
02:43:15,580 --> 02:43:16,860
I got the achievement.

2873
02:43:17,140 --> 02:43:18,760
I didn't even know there was an...

2874
02:43:18,760 --> 02:43:19,500
Wait, what?

2875
02:43:20,620 --> 02:43:21,220
What?

2876
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:22,680
How?

2877
02:43:26,770 --> 02:43:27,370
What?

2878
02:43:28,370 --> 02:43:29,550
Is it because I ran?

2879
02:43:29,930 --> 02:43:30,470
Goodbye.

2880
02:43:33,230 --> 02:43:35,530
Is it because I ran?

2881
02:43:35,530 --> 02:43:38,330
I can't believe it.

2882
02:43:39,150 --> 02:43:41,150
I can't believe it.

2883
02:43:41,610 --> 02:43:43,910
I can't believe I ran.

2884
02:43:45,750 --> 02:43:47,350
They heard me running.

2885
02:43:51,930 --> 02:43:53,570
They heard me running.

2886
02:43:53,690 --> 02:43:54,970
I can't believe it.

2887
02:43:57,720 --> 02:43:59,780
Okay, we're gonna get there.

2888
02:44:00,660 --> 02:44:04,300
We will fucking get there if it's the last thing I fucking do.

2889
02:44:07,810 --> 02:44:10,070
No, it's just funnier to...

2890
02:44:11,450 --> 02:44:12,570
What's this?

2891
02:44:15,090 --> 02:44:17,570
Wait, what the fuck is that?

2892
02:44:17,910 --> 02:44:22,190
What is that?

2893
02:44:26,900 --> 02:44:30,380
Oh man, that's what it is, the shoulder swap.

2894
02:44:31,160 --> 02:44:32,880
What the fuck?

2895
02:44:44,390 --> 02:44:45,190
What?

2896
02:44:51,390 --> 02:44:52,670
What do I do?

2897
02:45:14,770 --> 02:45:16,410
Will they come out?

2898
02:45:16,410 --> 02:45:16,490
Will they come out?

2899
02:45:22,280 --> 02:45:24,060
Can I crawl under the gun?

2900
02:45:34,910 --> 02:45:36,390
But how do I prone again?

2901
02:45:38,870 --> 02:45:39,870
Guys, how do I prone?

2902
02:45:40,750 --> 02:45:41,530
Is there a prone?

2903
02:45:42,590 --> 02:45:44,570
I don't know if there's a prone, right?

2904
02:45:47,590 --> 02:45:48,590
Sprint, stance...

2905
02:45:49,190 --> 02:45:50,290
There's no prone.

2906
02:45:50,410 --> 02:45:51,290
Is it hold crouch?

2907
02:45:54,370 --> 02:45:54,870
No.

2908
02:45:54,870 --> 02:45:54,910
No.

2909
02:45:55,510 --> 02:45:58,850
I can't.

2910
02:46:00,510 --> 02:46:02,130
They saw me.

2911
02:46:07,450 --> 02:46:08,650
That's fine.

2912
02:46:09,270 --> 02:46:10,630
We'll die to get there.

2913
02:46:11,210 --> 02:46:13,090
We will die to get there.

2914
02:46:17,100 --> 02:46:18,720
We can't.

2915
02:46:18,860 --> 02:46:22,400
You can't fucking crawl while you're proning.

2916
02:46:22,540 --> 02:46:24,100
This is so bullshit.

2917
02:46:25,380 --> 02:46:27,640
This is fucking bullshit.

2918
02:46:28,160 --> 02:46:29,680
You can't.

2919
02:46:29,780 --> 02:46:30,560
I tried.

2920
02:46:30,800 --> 02:46:32,240
I nearly tried.

2921
02:46:36,840 --> 02:46:38,540
Oh my god.

2922
02:46:38,880 --> 02:46:40,540
I need to get to him.

2923
02:46:42,360 --> 02:46:43,040
You can't?

2924
02:46:43,160 --> 02:46:43,520
How?

2925
02:46:44,320 --> 02:46:47,480
It won't let me.

2926
02:46:48,360 --> 02:46:49,040
Look, see?

2927
02:46:51,960 --> 02:46:54,500
I can only like, do that.

2928
02:46:57,580 --> 02:46:59,380
It nearly won't let me.

2929
02:47:07,350 --> 02:47:08,390
Just prone.

2930
02:47:08,750 --> 02:47:17,810
I don't

2931
02:47:23,020 --> 02:47:24,180
know, maybe I'm doing it wrong.

2932
02:47:24,360 --> 02:47:25,260
But it didn't let me.

2933
02:47:26,900 --> 02:47:28,600
I'm scared of like, sprinting.

2934
02:47:28,600 --> 02:47:29,700
I need to find him.

2935
02:47:32,830 --> 02:47:34,350
He's like here somewhere.

2936
02:47:35,720 --> 02:47:37,010
He's checking the boats.

2937
02:47:43,060 --> 02:47:43,680
Wait,

2938
02:47:48,810 --> 02:47:49,270
how do I?

2939
02:47:49,550 --> 02:47:50,270
Wait a minute.

2940
02:47:50,390 --> 02:47:51,490
I can't get across.

2941
02:47:53,170 --> 02:47:54,930
How do I get across?

2942
02:47:56,710 --> 02:47:58,090
Wait a minute.

2943
02:47:59,290 --> 02:48:02,450
How do I get across?

2944
02:48:02,970 --> 02:48:04,050
Wait a minute.

2945
02:48:04,050 --> 02:48:05,530
Okay, this is awkward.

2946
02:48:06,010 --> 02:48:08,110
Because I don't know how.

2947
02:48:08,850 --> 02:48:10,850
I don't know how to get across.

2948
02:48:11,390 --> 02:48:12,690
I think I'm stuck here.

2949
02:48:12,990 --> 02:48:16,910
Wait, you can?

2950
02:48:17,910 --> 02:48:20,530
Oh, there's an entrance right here.

2951
02:48:24,840 --> 02:48:25,980
Okay, I figured it out.

2952
02:48:27,540 --> 02:48:29,260
It's like right over here.

2953
02:48:29,440 --> 02:48:30,040
It's so tiny.

2954
02:48:36,010 --> 02:48:36,610
Ceremony.

2955
02:48:36,930 --> 02:48:38,470
I want to go to the ceremony.

2956
02:48:54,830 --> 02:48:55,430
Fine.

2957
02:48:55,950 --> 02:48:56,470
That's fine.

2958
02:48:56,790 --> 02:48:58,830
They didn't hear it.

2959
02:48:59,070 --> 02:48:59,450
There we go.

2960
02:49:01,410 --> 02:49:02,410
It was silent.

2961
02:49:14,530 --> 02:49:15,910
There we go.

2962
02:49:19,290 --> 02:49:20,350
Woah, woah, woah.

2963
02:49:20,770 --> 02:49:23,850
I gotta figure out where that ceremony is being held.

2964
02:49:27,130 --> 02:49:29,650
Where is this ceremony being held?

2965
02:49:34,380 --> 02:49:37,900
Oh, this was where he was touring earlier, but I was too late!

2966
02:49:48,740 --> 02:49:51,580
I gotta find where all the people are.

2967
02:50:00,630 --> 02:50:01,270
Okay.

2968
02:50:06,110 --> 02:50:07,650
Alright, we got this guy.

2969
02:50:13,850 --> 02:50:14,210
Oh!

2970
02:50:15,810 --> 02:50:16,450
No!

2971
02:50:21,610 --> 02:50:23,290
I don't think he knows.

2972
02:50:23,770 --> 02:50:25,830
I don't think he knows, guys.

2973
02:50:27,330 --> 02:50:28,910
I don't think he knew.

2974
02:50:32,090 --> 02:50:34,870
How is there wind here?

2975
02:50:37,350 --> 02:50:39,430
Oh, did I have my scope at 100?

2976
02:50:39,430 --> 02:50:42,110
Oh, it still worked, though.

2977
02:50:42,210 --> 02:50:43,210
It still worked.

2978
02:50:46,610 --> 02:50:49,890
That makes so much more sense now.

2979
02:50:50,050 --> 02:50:51,770
I was like, why is that working?

2980
02:50:53,410 --> 02:50:54,730
Where am I?

2981
02:50:55,350 --> 02:50:57,430
Also, where the fuck am I?

2982
02:51:04,550 --> 02:51:08,070
I'm trying my best to find him!

2983
02:51:11,450 --> 02:51:13,550
I didn't figure out how to get out of here!

2984
02:51:15,770 --> 02:51:17,370
Am I beneath him?

2985
02:51:17,370 --> 02:51:18,930
There's no way.

2986
02:51:21,690 --> 02:51:22,150
Oh!

2987
02:51:23,550 --> 02:51:24,290
Oh!

2988
02:51:26,150 --> 02:51:27,410
Oh my god!

2989
02:51:27,770 --> 02:51:30,050
Oh, this fucking sucks.

2990
02:51:30,190 --> 02:51:30,870
He's so far.

2991
02:51:31,150 --> 02:51:35,730
Okay, but first off, before I...

2992
02:51:35,730 --> 02:51:36,170
Okay.

2993
02:51:37,010 --> 02:51:39,370
But like...

2994
02:51:41,010 --> 02:51:41,750
No!

2995
02:51:43,310 --> 02:51:44,990
I still got the headshot.

2996
02:51:49,480 --> 02:51:51,980
I have to get this shot first.

2997
02:51:55,320 --> 02:51:56,000
Okay.

2998
02:51:56,360 --> 02:51:56,880
Alright.

2999
02:51:57,080 --> 02:51:58,100
I got this shot.

3000
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:02,260
We need to make sure we actually kill him first.

3001
02:52:02,560 --> 02:52:04,340
We gotta make sure.

3002
02:52:04,400 --> 02:52:10,040
We gotta make sure we actually kill him before we do the real shot.

3003
02:52:11,400 --> 02:52:14,740
Just saying that we do care.

3004
02:52:14,740 --> 02:52:15,640
You know?

3005
02:52:15,900 --> 02:52:17,000
Alright, this is...

3006
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:22,720
God fucking...

3007
02:52:28,220 --> 02:52:29,060
Okay.

3008
02:52:32,180 --> 02:52:33,980
God damn it!

3009
02:52:34,160 --> 02:52:35,560
The fucking wind!

3010
02:52:36,200 --> 02:52:37,300
The wind!

3011
02:52:37,740 --> 02:52:39,820
How does he dodge it?

3012
02:52:40,220 --> 02:52:40,600
Okay.

3013
02:52:48,660 --> 02:52:50,220
Are you...

3014
02:52:50,220 --> 02:52:50,440
What?

3015
02:52:50,740 --> 02:52:52,180
I don't understand!

3016
02:52:52,700 --> 02:52:54,460
How do you dodge it?

3017
02:52:57,060 --> 02:52:57,680
Okay.

3018
02:53:06,180 --> 02:53:06,700
How?

3019
02:53:07,220 --> 02:53:09,260
Where's your fucking ball?

3020
02:53:12,340 --> 02:53:15,960
That's so slow and steady!

3021
02:53:20,240 --> 02:53:23,280
The shot could end the war, guys.

3022
02:53:24,380 --> 02:53:25,360
This shot!

3023
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:26,740
You fucker!

3024
02:53:30,880 --> 02:53:34,460
I just... At least I got his lungs.

3025
02:53:34,840 --> 02:53:36,120
I got his lungs!

3026
02:53:37,520 --> 02:53:39,140
I got...

3027
02:53:39,140 --> 02:53:40,820
I got his lungs!

3028
02:53:40,820 --> 02:53:43,260
Oh my god.

3029
02:53:44,420 --> 02:53:46,940
This shot could end the war!

3030
02:53:51,080 --> 02:53:52,720
Right here.

3031
02:53:54,960 --> 02:53:55,540
I...

3032
02:54:03,970 --> 02:54:07,870
Not even gonna adjust it.

3033
02:54:11,590 --> 02:54:12,170
Oh.

3034
02:54:12,350 --> 02:54:13,290
Oh wait, he didn't even hear it.

3035
02:54:13,670 --> 02:54:15,070
Oh my god, you know what?

3036
02:54:15,130 --> 02:54:15,770
I know why.

3037
02:54:16,670 --> 02:54:18,510
I know why!

3038
02:54:20,890 --> 02:54:21,470
Wait.

3039
02:54:42,800 --> 02:54:43,380
Okay!

3040
02:54:43,740 --> 02:54:45,300
That has to be something!

3041
02:54:45,840 --> 02:54:46,900
Right there!

3042
02:54:52,160 --> 02:54:53,260
My bird!

3043
02:54:53,860 --> 02:54:55,020
My bird!

3044
02:54:55,340 --> 02:54:55,740
No!

3045
02:54:57,340 --> 02:54:57,660
Okay.

3046
02:54:58,840 --> 02:55:00,400
We did it!

3047
02:55:03,440 --> 02:55:04,980
Okay, there we go.

3048
02:55:13,460 --> 02:55:14,460
There we go.

3049
02:55:16,720 --> 02:55:18,100
You guys hear that?

3050
02:55:18,320 --> 02:55:19,860
The shot could end the war, guys.

3051
02:55:19,860 --> 02:55:21,440
This shot...

3052
02:55:21,440 --> 02:55:23,340
God damn it, it's his ass!

3053
02:55:25,560 --> 02:55:26,640
This shot...

3054
02:55:26,640 --> 02:55:29,180
This is personal now.

3055
02:55:30,320 --> 02:55:31,280
Oh no.

3056
02:55:31,580 --> 02:55:33,140
I didn't mean to save it.

3057
02:55:35,500 --> 02:55:36,900
Easy does it.

3058
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:39,160
This shot could end the war, guys.

3059
02:55:48,150 --> 02:55:49,470
Right here.

3060
02:55:52,090 --> 02:55:54,490
Oh my god, that's the leg!

3061
02:55:54,990 --> 02:55:56,950
Oh, that's the feet!

3062
02:56:01,770 --> 02:56:02,270
No.

3063
02:56:02,910 --> 02:56:05,030
We won't get this shot.

3064
02:56:08,470 --> 02:56:09,470
No!

3065
02:56:14,270 --> 02:56:15,270
God!

3066
02:56:19,690 --> 02:56:21,630
This will end the war!

3067
02:56:21,750 --> 02:56:22,970
You don't understand!

3068
02:56:30,660 --> 02:56:33,220
This shot will end the war.

3069
02:56:38,240 --> 02:56:38,980
Hit him!

3070
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:40,520
Ideally!

3071
02:56:44,300 --> 02:56:45,660
It's there!

3072
02:56:46,040 --> 02:56:47,420
I can get a headshot!

3073
02:56:47,420 --> 02:56:49,220
I can get a headshot!

3074
02:56:49,460 --> 02:56:50,860
I can get a leg shot!

3075
02:56:51,520 --> 02:56:53,480
But, like, I just...

3076
02:56:53,480 --> 02:56:55,820
Oh my god, he needs to...

3077
02:56:55,820 --> 02:56:57,140
Oh, his balls.

3078
02:56:57,280 --> 02:56:58,580
His fucking balls.

3079
02:56:59,480 --> 02:57:01,160
His stupid balls.

3080
02:57:02,020 --> 02:57:03,460
Where is the ball?

3081
02:57:04,360 --> 02:57:06,080
Where is it?

3082
02:57:14,790 --> 02:57:15,510
No!

3083
02:57:16,650 --> 02:57:17,370
No!

3084
02:57:17,910 --> 02:57:23,950
It was right there!

3085
02:57:24,150 --> 02:57:24,670
I see it!

3086
02:57:25,730 --> 02:57:28,790
His cone is covering it up!

3087
02:57:29,290 --> 02:57:31,390
It was right there!

3088
02:57:31,790 --> 02:57:34,510
I'm gonna shoot you in the balls if I have to.

3089
02:57:37,230 --> 02:57:38,370
I'm mad.

3090
02:57:38,930 --> 02:57:40,950
I'm so mad.

3091
02:57:42,030 --> 02:57:43,430
I'm getting closer.

3092
02:57:43,430 --> 02:57:43,510
I'm getting closer.

3093
02:57:45,870 --> 02:57:46,830
There's no way.

3094
02:57:46,930 --> 02:57:48,490
Did I accidentally overwrite it?

3095
02:57:51,350 --> 02:57:51,870
No!

3096
02:57:59,300 --> 02:57:59,820
Wait!

3097
02:58:00,760 --> 02:58:01,800
I'm 19.

3098
02:58:02,320 --> 02:58:02,940
Oh no.

3099
02:58:04,620 --> 02:58:05,040
Wait.

3100
02:58:05,960 --> 02:58:07,360
Wait, is this the one?

3101
02:58:09,160 --> 02:58:09,940
Oh, there we go.

3102
02:58:10,100 --> 02:58:10,680
We're okay.

3103
02:58:13,500 --> 02:58:14,660
Easy does it.

3104
02:58:14,740 --> 02:58:16,240
This shot will save the war.

3105
02:58:22,030 --> 02:58:24,090
This shot can end the war.

3106
02:58:25,230 --> 02:58:27,590
Easy does it.

3107
02:58:36,850 --> 02:58:37,850
Yes!

3108
02:58:38,110 --> 02:58:38,490
Yes!

3109
02:58:38,870 --> 02:58:39,870
No!

3110
02:58:40,950 --> 02:58:42,290
His hamstring!

3111
02:58:43,430 --> 02:58:47,670
I got his fucking knee.

3112
02:58:49,590 --> 02:58:50,590
No!

3113
02:58:51,110 --> 02:58:53,010
It's a stupid knee.

3114
02:58:57,130 --> 02:58:57,610
Okay.

3115
02:58:57,610 --> 02:58:58,830
Okay.

3116
02:59:00,550 --> 02:59:01,270
Okay.

3117
02:59:01,990 --> 02:59:03,610
We're getting better though.

3118
02:59:03,910 --> 02:59:04,750
This shot can end the war.

3119
02:59:05,270 --> 02:59:06,470
It's this one.

3120
02:59:06,570 --> 02:59:07,390
It's right here.

3121
02:59:07,910 --> 02:59:09,430
That's where the ball is.

3122
02:59:13,830 --> 02:59:14,550
No.

3123
02:59:17,170 --> 02:59:19,150
Oh my god!

3124
02:59:19,710 --> 02:59:21,930
It's where the ball is!

3125
02:59:29,230 --> 02:59:31,890
The shot that could end the war!

3126
02:59:31,890 --> 02:59:36,770
We need a death shot that can end the stupid war!

3127
02:59:39,730 --> 02:59:40,270
Easy does it.

3128
02:59:40,930 --> 02:59:42,090
This shot can end the war.

3129
02:59:43,090 --> 02:59:44,410
Guys, did you hear?

3130
02:59:45,570 --> 02:59:47,630
This shot could end the war.

3131
02:59:51,390 --> 02:59:52,510
Come on.

3132
02:59:56,830 --> 02:59:57,830
Right here.

3133
03:00:00,110 --> 03:00:01,970
Oh my god, that was his leg.

3134
03:00:02,630 --> 03:00:03,690
That has to be it.

3135
03:00:06,250 --> 03:00:07,410
That's it!

3136
03:00:09,650 --> 03:00:13,240
I see it!

3137
03:00:13,480 --> 03:00:14,800
I see it!

3138
03:00:15,060 --> 03:00:16,980
I see the ball!

3139
03:00:19,240 --> 03:00:20,080
I see it.

3140
03:00:20,260 --> 03:00:22,040
It's right there.

3141
03:00:23,200 --> 03:00:28,240
It's actually right there.

3142
03:00:31,780 --> 03:00:32,740
Okay.

3143
03:00:33,720 --> 03:00:34,880
I see it.

3144
03:00:34,980 --> 03:00:36,600
I see where it is.

3145
03:00:36,600 --> 03:00:38,360
That's the worst part!

3146
03:00:39,260 --> 03:00:40,260
This shot could end the war.

3147
03:00:43,390 --> 03:00:43,750
Okay.

3148
03:00:46,550 --> 03:00:47,770
No, I can't.

3149
03:00:47,810 --> 03:00:49,430
I have to have him walk to me.

3150
03:00:51,230 --> 03:00:52,910
I'm just gonna take this headshot.

3151
03:00:53,190 --> 03:00:54,350
I'm just gonna...

3152
03:00:54,350 --> 03:00:56,190
I'm just gonna take the head.

3153
03:00:57,910 --> 03:01:00,530
How many times do I have to kill you?

3154
03:01:00,870 --> 03:01:02,710
How many times?

3155
03:01:03,330 --> 03:01:06,330
How many times must I kill you?

3156
03:01:06,330 --> 03:01:09,750
Until I get what I want!

3157
03:01:15,110 --> 03:01:16,850
The wrong head.

3158
03:01:18,990 --> 03:01:21,050
How much more?

3159
03:01:24,990 --> 03:01:25,850
Move!

3160
03:01:26,370 --> 03:01:26,770
Walk!

3161
03:01:30,150 --> 03:01:31,510
Start walking.

3162
03:01:37,190 --> 03:01:38,430
Is that it?

3163
03:01:40,450 --> 03:01:41,770
Is that it?

3164
03:01:41,950 --> 03:01:42,530
Is that it?

3165
03:01:42,830 --> 03:01:43,570
Is that it?

3166
03:01:46,890 --> 03:01:49,670
Where did I shot him in the ass?

3167
03:01:53,980 --> 03:01:54,560
Where?

3168
03:01:55,080 --> 03:01:56,460
What was that shot?

3169
03:02:00,800 --> 03:02:03,300
Did I get him in the fucking ass?

3170
03:02:03,420 --> 03:02:04,940
Where was that?

3171
03:02:05,520 --> 03:02:06,760
This shot could end the war.

3172
03:02:11,130 --> 03:02:12,830
Oh my god, this is it.

3173
03:02:12,830 --> 03:02:15,230
Yes!

3174
03:02:16,290 --> 03:02:17,630
Yes!

3175
03:02:18,590 --> 03:02:19,230
Yes!

3176
03:02:20,950 --> 03:02:22,890
Oh my god!

3177
03:02:24,930 --> 03:02:27,370
Oh my god!

3178
03:02:28,350 --> 03:02:29,350
Oh my god!

3179
03:02:29,350 --> 03:02:29,350
Oh my god!

3180
03:02:29,350 --> 03:02:29,350
Oh my god!

3181
03:02:29,350 --> 03:02:29,350
Oh my god!

3182
03:02:29,350 --> 03:02:29,350
Oh!

3183
03:02:29,350 --> 03:02:31,690
Let's go!

3184
03:02:34,890 --> 03:02:36,050
Yes, V!

3185
03:02:36,910 --> 03:02:37,770
Yeah!

3186
03:02:38,750 --> 03:02:39,870
Yeah, that's right!

3187
03:02:40,490 --> 03:02:42,130
I did it, yeah!

3188
03:02:46,970 --> 03:02:49,250
We were all here!

3189
03:02:50,030 --> 03:02:51,810
We were all here!

3190
03:02:52,410 --> 03:02:54,350
We got the bots!

3191
03:02:54,830 --> 03:02:55,250
Yeah!

3192
03:02:56,370 --> 03:02:58,590
That's right, it was me!

3193
03:03:00,530 --> 03:03:03,290
I shot that end of the war!

3194
03:03:04,290 --> 03:03:05,790
I did that!

3195
03:03:07,430 --> 03:03:09,070
Let's go, I ended the war.

3196
03:03:10,530 --> 03:03:12,470
I fucking ended the war, guys.

3197
03:03:12,550 --> 03:03:13,950
How do I get out of here now?

3198
03:03:14,730 --> 03:03:15,590
The shot!

3199
03:03:15,670 --> 03:03:17,830
The shot that ended the war!

3200
03:03:18,070 --> 03:03:19,250
We were all here!

3201
03:03:19,970 --> 03:03:23,950
We were all- chat, thank you for the super chat!

3202
03:03:24,330 --> 03:03:25,670
We did it, guys!

3203
03:03:27,850 --> 03:03:31,170
We're here for the shot that ended the war, everybody!

3204
03:03:31,170 --> 03:03:34,490
You were all part of it!

3205
03:03:35,310 --> 03:03:38,030
We don't need a sniper anymore!

3206
03:03:38,710 --> 03:03:40,610
We ended the war!

3207
03:03:41,870 --> 03:03:43,570
No more nut!

3208
03:03:44,350 --> 03:03:45,750
We did it!

3209
03:03:47,750 --> 03:03:48,970
It was us!

3210
03:03:51,570 --> 03:03:53,310
It was us!

3211
03:03:53,430 --> 03:03:54,430
No more sniper!

3212
03:03:54,870 --> 03:03:55,710
Retired!

3213
03:03:57,630 --> 03:04:01,510
No more- we ended the war, did you guys hear?

3214
03:04:02,430 --> 03:04:04,110
We ended the war!

3215
03:04:06,570 --> 03:04:08,570
That's what they told me!

3216
03:04:10,330 --> 03:04:14,150
They said if I got the shot, I'd end the war!

3217
03:04:16,710 --> 03:04:19,390
That's what they said, is it not true?

3218
03:04:22,500 --> 03:04:23,770
Is that not true?

3219
03:04:28,970 --> 03:04:31,190
I ended the war!

3220
03:04:31,710 --> 03:04:33,030
It's over!

3221
03:04:34,050 --> 03:04:35,570
The war is over!

3222
03:04:35,750 --> 03:04:37,550
Remember who ended the war?

3223
03:04:39,850 --> 03:04:43,350
He said it could not, that it would.

3224
03:04:43,810 --> 03:04:44,610
It's fine.

3225
03:04:45,130 --> 03:04:47,070
We did it, we did our job.

3226
03:04:47,070 --> 03:04:52,390
She is- I don't know how to get out!

3227
03:04:52,990 --> 03:04:54,770
Oh, it's this way!

3228
03:04:55,270 --> 03:04:57,870
Wait, am I going the right way?

3229
03:04:58,130 --> 03:04:59,730
I don't know!

3230
03:05:00,970 --> 03:05:01,890
Wait, it's this way.

3231
03:05:02,670 --> 03:05:03,290
This way.

3232
03:05:05,130 --> 03:05:07,090
It's fine, I figured it out.

3233
03:05:10,030 --> 03:05:11,390
I'm doing it!

3234
03:05:12,390 --> 03:05:13,790
I'm doing it!

3235
03:05:14,590 --> 03:05:18,890
I figured it out, the shot that ended the- oh my god!

3236
03:05:19,150 --> 03:05:22,270
Oh god, oh god, how are you still alive?

3237
03:05:22,890 --> 03:05:25,890
Oh my god, how am I still alive?

3238
03:05:28,190 --> 03:05:31,390
It's okay, we're so healthy right now.

3239
03:05:34,650 --> 03:05:39,390
Oh, you think- oh, I shot his ball, you think I don't?

3240
03:05:39,870 --> 03:05:40,910
Oh, beat your fucking head.

3241
03:05:41,150 --> 03:05:42,630
Oh, you fucking- that's right!

3242
03:05:42,910 --> 03:05:43,990
What the fuck?

3243
03:05:44,170 --> 03:05:45,910
This guy thinks it is Apex.

3244
03:05:47,590 --> 03:05:49,230
That's right, walk away.

3245
03:05:52,230 --> 03:05:53,650
Oh my god!

3246
03:05:57,010 --> 03:06:01,990
I'm gonna shoot you in the fucking intestine and slide.

3247
03:06:08,010 --> 03:06:10,930
That man hit the power slide.

3248
03:06:12,070 --> 03:06:13,570
That's fucking right.

3249
03:06:15,730 --> 03:06:17,670
Oh, you think I'm scared?

3250
03:06:17,910 --> 03:06:20,070
I literally shot him in the balls.

3251
03:06:21,270 --> 03:06:23,790
Okay, I need some medkits though, I'm a little scared.

3252
03:06:27,670 --> 03:06:29,530
Wait, what did Carl Williams say?

3253
03:06:31,250 --> 03:06:35,170
My superchance, it went too fast because I did it.

3254
03:06:38,450 --> 03:06:39,990
What do you say, guys?

3255
03:06:44,750 --> 03:06:47,450
Oh no, I'm a little fucked up right now.

3256
03:06:53,930 --> 03:06:56,550
Jesus Christ, I can't- I can barely peek.

3257
03:06:57,310 --> 03:06:58,230
Get out of here.

3258
03:06:59,230 --> 03:07:05,610
He gave me a med- You're a goddamn hero.

3259
03:07:06,050 --> 03:07:08,470
That's fucking right I am.

3260
03:07:09,070 --> 03:07:10,510
That's right.

3261
03:07:11,250 --> 03:07:12,550
Now you know.

3262
03:07:13,150 --> 03:07:14,930
Now you know what I could do.

3263
03:07:17,910 --> 03:07:19,150
Oh shit.

3264
03:07:20,850 --> 03:07:23,350
Now you know what I could do right now.

3265
03:07:29,850 --> 03:07:31,090
It's starting now.

3266
03:07:31,650 --> 03:07:33,830
Starting now you know what I can do.

3267
03:07:37,010 --> 03:07:39,470
Now you know what I'm capable of.

3268
03:07:39,890 --> 03:07:41,890
I need to get out of here first though.

3269
03:07:47,450 --> 03:07:47,930
Okay.

3270
03:07:50,430 --> 03:07:51,790
How are you alive?

3271
03:07:53,150 --> 03:07:53,630
Child!

3272
03:07:56,650 --> 03:07:58,650
Oh no, I gotta figure out how to get out of here.

3273
03:07:59,330 --> 03:08:02,010
Oh no, this is bad for me.

3274
03:08:02,170 --> 03:08:03,310
Oh no.

3275
03:08:04,150 --> 03:08:05,970
Wait, oh I didn't see him!

3276
03:08:10,160 --> 03:08:10,740
Get out of here!

3277
03:08:11,100 --> 03:08:12,700
That's it, I'm running and gunning.

3278
03:08:13,280 --> 03:08:14,200
That's it.

3279
03:08:16,900 --> 03:08:17,940
Starting now.

3280
03:08:20,540 --> 03:08:21,660
Starting- okay.

3281
03:08:22,440 --> 03:08:23,280
Starting now!

3282
03:08:27,770 --> 03:08:28,930
Starting now!

3283
03:08:30,750 --> 03:08:32,610
Okay, now I fucking am running.

3284
03:08:32,610 --> 03:08:34,610
Oh no!

3285
03:08:38,430 --> 03:08:42,530
Mac, thank you for the- Why are they all so mad?

3286
03:08:42,970 --> 03:08:43,870
I don't understand.

3287
03:08:44,230 --> 03:08:45,590
I don't know why they're so mad.

3288
03:08:46,090 --> 03:08:48,650
Like, it's like I killed somebody very important.

3289
03:08:48,950 --> 03:08:50,050
Why are they all so mad?

3290
03:08:51,170 --> 03:08:56,090
I fucking- I'm getting- I have no idea.

3291
03:08:56,810 --> 03:08:58,650
What could they be so mad about?

3292
03:08:59,470 --> 03:09:00,950
I wonder why.

3293
03:09:04,070 --> 03:09:08,150
Like, what did I do to piss them off, guys?

3294
03:09:08,750 --> 03:09:10,210
What could it be?

3295
03:09:14,280 --> 03:09:16,200
Oh god, there's people behind me too.

3296
03:09:16,880 --> 03:09:19,840
Oh, I'm like stuck here in a really bad place.

3297
03:09:26,510 --> 03:09:27,070
Okay.

3298
03:09:28,330 --> 03:09:28,890
Alright.

3299
03:09:31,790 --> 03:09:36,030
Oh, it's cause I have- Come on, get out of here.

3300
03:09:36,050 --> 03:09:36,750
I know you're there.

3301
03:09:37,150 --> 03:09:37,950
There we go.

3302
03:09:38,870 --> 03:09:40,790
Oh my god, okay, I'm medkit.

3303
03:09:43,210 --> 03:09:43,570
Alright.

3304
03:09:44,690 --> 03:09:47,470
I told you it was the shot that could end the war.

3305
03:09:52,140 --> 03:09:53,690
There's like one guy here.

3306
03:09:56,710 --> 03:09:57,890
Where are they?

3307
03:10:01,650 --> 03:10:07,390
Oh my god, I can't walk over cause I don't know where the last two people are here!

3308
03:10:09,010 --> 03:10:11,830
Oh, that's- Okay.

3309
03:10:12,790 --> 03:10:13,730
Let's try them in the heart.

3310
03:10:14,990 --> 03:10:17,250
Oh no, I don't have a lot of heals left.

3311
03:10:19,690 --> 03:10:21,550
I can't run!

3312
03:10:39,400 --> 03:10:40,160
Oh shit.

3313
03:10:40,320 --> 03:10:40,600
No!

3314
03:10:43,260 --> 03:10:44,760
I pinned down!

3315
03:10:45,140 --> 03:10:47,040
I pinned down somebody!

3316
03:10:53,750 --> 03:10:54,510
SOS!

3317
03:10:54,510 --> 03:10:54,890
SOS!

3318
03:10:56,090 --> 03:10:58,390
Doki has taken the shot!

3319
03:10:59,090 --> 03:11:00,550
She requires assistance!

3320
03:11:04,270 --> 03:11:07,270
She needs reinforcements.

3321
03:11:08,410 --> 03:11:09,010
SOS!

3322
03:11:12,950 --> 03:11:14,430
She took the shot!

3323
03:11:15,790 --> 03:11:16,170
No!

3324
03:11:17,470 --> 03:11:22,670
Saving private Doki, I'm sending an SOS message right now!

3325
03:11:22,670 --> 03:11:25,670
I can't get out of here!

3326
03:11:27,330 --> 03:11:29,870
SOS, private Doki needs help!

3327
03:11:43,600 --> 03:11:45,400
Are you serious?

3328
03:11:45,640 --> 03:11:47,760
Peek your fucking head, you coward!

3329
03:11:51,820 --> 03:11:54,800
If I could, I would also shoot you in the ball.

3330
03:11:55,520 --> 03:11:58,260
Oh, you have two balls, so like...

3331
03:11:58,260 --> 03:12:00,260
It'd be fine for you.

3332
03:12:03,100 --> 03:12:05,480
SOS, private Doki needs backup!

3333
03:12:07,200 --> 03:12:08,800
She's pinned down!

3334
03:12:16,030 --> 03:12:18,550
She's pinned down, she needs assistance!

3335
03:12:24,350 --> 03:12:27,090
Is this how you treat your heroes?

3336
03:12:27,090 --> 03:12:27,410
SOS!

3337
03:12:30,050 --> 03:12:33,730
Oh my god, I am not doing okay right now.

3338
03:12:33,790 --> 03:12:36,890
I am absolutely not doing okay.

3339
03:12:38,910 --> 03:12:42,110
Bro, fuck this particular railing!

3340
03:12:44,770 --> 03:12:50,090
Guys, guys, it's like they sent everybody here and I don't...

3341
03:12:51,890 --> 03:12:52,270
No!

3342
03:12:52,270 --> 03:12:52,390
SOS!

3343
03:12:55,090 --> 03:12:56,870
I need to escape!

3344
03:12:57,410 --> 03:12:59,070
I need to escape!

3345
03:12:59,650 --> 03:13:00,870
But how?

3346
03:13:03,890 --> 03:13:06,450
How do I escape from here?

3347
03:13:06,910 --> 03:13:09,650
It's like I killed their leader or something!

3348
03:13:10,630 --> 03:13:12,290
It's actually crazy!

3349
03:13:13,070 --> 03:13:17,570
Oh my god, this guy has like... How come I can't do that?

3350
03:13:22,910 --> 03:13:26,510
Why can't I just run around and dodge all the bullets?

3351
03:13:27,190 --> 03:13:32,570
I don't know, it seems a little unfair.

3352
03:13:32,890 --> 03:13:33,930
Not gonna lie.

3353
03:13:37,430 --> 03:13:39,640
The fact that he could just do that...

3354
03:13:41,040 --> 03:13:46,860
Oh my god, okay, that's... I admire the spirit there.

3355
03:13:47,500 --> 03:13:49,360
I admire that.

3356
03:13:52,040 --> 03:13:54,200
Empty lung, that's fucking right.

3357
03:13:54,980 --> 03:13:56,700
Okay, wait.

3358
03:13:57,880 --> 03:13:59,660
Wait, who the fuck shot me?

3359
03:13:59,740 --> 03:14:01,200
Oh, he's still alive over there.

3360
03:14:01,400 --> 03:14:03,140
Wait, who still shot me?

3361
03:14:04,120 --> 03:14:04,920
Oh shit.

3362
03:14:08,530 --> 03:14:10,950
Okay, I didn't realize that guy was still alive.

3363
03:14:14,610 --> 03:14:15,790
Is that it?

3364
03:14:16,550 --> 03:14:17,130
What's it say?

3365
03:14:18,070 --> 03:14:22,550
Please tell me, don't take that shot.

3366
03:14:22,930 --> 03:14:26,910
Oh my god, he has a band-aid.

3367
03:14:27,370 --> 03:14:29,870
He has one band-aid.

3368
03:14:30,310 --> 03:14:32,690
He has one band-aid.

3369
03:14:41,020 --> 03:14:43,440
Oh my god, look at all these bodies.

3370
03:14:44,060 --> 03:14:45,980
Oh my god.

3371
03:14:46,660 --> 03:14:49,840
Oh my god, we're making it out, boys!

3372
03:14:49,900 --> 03:14:51,200
We're making it out!

3373
03:14:53,020 --> 03:14:55,280
We're making it out of here!

3374
03:15:04,970 --> 03:15:07,530
Fucking hell, nobody has a fucking band-aid.

3375
03:15:07,830 --> 03:15:08,890
Not even one.

3376
03:15:09,110 --> 03:15:11,770
Not even one singular band-aid.

3377
03:15:12,150 --> 03:15:13,570
What is wrong with all of you?

3378
03:15:15,250 --> 03:15:16,990
What is wrong with all of you?

3379
03:15:17,730 --> 03:15:18,590
Oh my god, he's right here.

3380
03:15:22,780 --> 03:15:24,200
Oh my god, please.

3381
03:15:33,550 --> 03:15:34,650
That's fine.

3382
03:15:43,710 --> 03:15:45,450
No, that's bad.

3383
03:15:45,490 --> 03:15:46,530
That's not fine.

3384
03:15:49,630 --> 03:15:51,550
That's okay, that's okay.

3385
03:15:56,270 --> 03:15:58,010
That's fine, that's fine.

3386
03:16:03,460 --> 03:16:04,580
That should hit.

3387
03:16:06,860 --> 03:16:08,080
Is that a headshot?

3388
03:16:09,560 --> 03:16:10,280
Let's go!

3389
03:16:12,650 --> 03:16:13,810
Okay, we should save.

3390
03:16:16,810 --> 03:16:17,770
We run.

3391
03:16:17,990 --> 03:16:18,670
We book it.

3392
03:16:18,890 --> 03:16:19,810
We can make it.

3393
03:16:20,190 --> 03:16:21,410
We can make it!

3394
03:16:22,130 --> 03:16:23,670
We fucking book it!

3395
03:16:24,590 --> 03:16:26,010
They don't know I'm here.

3396
03:16:26,890 --> 03:16:29,350
Okay, I ran the wrong way, but that's okay.

3397
03:16:29,450 --> 03:16:30,090
They don't know.

3398
03:16:31,230 --> 03:16:34,070
Oh my god, I swear, I was like thinking I would trip and actually die.

3399
03:16:34,070 --> 03:16:36,690
I was like doing my look.

3400
03:16:36,830 --> 03:16:38,890
Oh my god, there's so many!

3401
03:16:45,810 --> 03:16:47,030
It's the only way.

3402
03:16:50,190 --> 03:16:51,610
They don't know.

3403
03:16:57,840 --> 03:16:58,860
They don't know.

3404
03:16:59,580 --> 03:17:00,740
How do I get there?

3405
03:17:03,220 --> 03:17:04,680
How do I get there?

3406
03:17:05,320 --> 03:17:08,680
That was the right one, but I put a mine over there.

3407
03:17:11,400 --> 03:17:13,240
Okay, I disabled my mine.

3408
03:17:14,440 --> 03:17:17,280
Okay, I gotta hope they step on this mine then.

3409
03:17:21,580 --> 03:17:25,300
I gotta hope they step on this mine.

3410
03:17:29,080 --> 03:17:31,320
They must step on the mine, right?

3411
03:17:35,460 --> 03:17:37,580
Do you think I can jump?

3412
03:17:37,580 --> 03:17:39,860
Oh, that's a lot of them.

3413
03:17:39,940 --> 03:17:42,040
That's a lot of them.

3414
03:17:42,800 --> 03:17:44,400
Oh my god.

3415
03:17:45,340 --> 03:17:45,800
Okay.

3416
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:48,280
Watch this.

3417
03:17:54,520 --> 03:17:55,680
They're gonna step on it.

3418
03:17:57,700 --> 03:17:59,320
Oh, yes!

3419
03:18:21,720 --> 03:18:22,760
Where am I?

3420
03:18:23,240 --> 03:18:24,600
Oh no, we're fucked.

3421
03:18:25,040 --> 03:18:26,700
Where the fuck was the sniper?

3422
03:18:28,140 --> 03:18:29,900
Where is the sniper?

3423
03:18:30,520 --> 03:18:31,660
Where was he?

3424
03:18:31,660 --> 03:18:33,120
I didn't know where he was!

3425
03:18:34,260 --> 03:18:36,320
I didn't know where he was!

3426
03:18:37,840 --> 03:18:38,980
Okay, it's fine.

3427
03:18:39,780 --> 03:18:41,460
It's fine, we got the infuses.

3428
03:18:43,080 --> 03:18:43,460
Okay.

3429
03:18:47,020 --> 03:18:48,740
I can put another one down.

3430
03:18:51,740 --> 03:18:53,520
Okay, everything will be fine.

3431
03:18:56,160 --> 03:18:57,680
I can jump through this window.

3432
03:18:58,340 --> 03:18:59,460
We're so healthy.

3433
03:19:03,190 --> 03:19:04,070
They wouldn't know.

3434
03:19:05,070 --> 03:19:09,990
Oh my god, I could have done that.

3435
03:19:10,550 --> 03:19:11,910
I could have just done that.

3436
03:19:12,110 --> 03:19:14,230
I could have just jumped through the window.

3437
03:19:14,570 --> 03:19:16,930
I didn't realize I could do that.

3438
03:19:21,330 --> 03:19:23,110
We're making it alive!

3439
03:19:25,490 --> 03:19:27,130
We're getting out of the

3440
03:19:37,720 --> 03:19:38,880
- We did it!

3441
03:19:39,400 --> 03:19:42,280
We took the shot at the end of the war.

3442
03:19:45,640 --> 03:19:47,240
I told you.

3443
03:19:47,240 --> 03:19:51,900
I told you we would take the shot at the end of the war.

3444
03:19:52,100 --> 03:19:58,240
I told you.

3445
03:19:59,580 --> 03:20:02,260
I told you the shot would end it.

3446
03:20:02,580 --> 03:20:04,300
The fall at the end of the war.

3447
03:20:04,440 --> 03:20:06,500
We fucking did it.

3448
03:20:06,900 --> 03:20:08,620
Oh my god.

3449
03:20:12,060 --> 03:20:13,660
You're welcome everybody.

3450
03:20:13,740 --> 03:20:14,480
I'm a hero.

3451
03:20:14,720 --> 03:20:15,960
I'm a fucking hero.

3452
03:20:19,080 --> 03:20:22,580
Dragoons, thank you for the super- Akasupa, thank you, thank you.

3453
03:20:22,640 --> 03:20:25,920
You might say that was a pretty baller shot.

3454
03:20:26,180 --> 03:20:28,300
Thank you pretty Akasupa.

3455
03:20:28,560 --> 03:20:29,880
Thank you, thank you.

3456
03:20:31,260 --> 03:20:35,080
It's not about how long it took us to get there.

3457
03:20:35,440 --> 03:20:38,000
It's about being a fucking hero.

3458
03:20:41,880 --> 03:20:43,440
Oh my god, that was fun.

3459
03:20:44,580 --> 03:20:45,360
That was fun.

3460
03:20:45,360 --> 03:20:48,980
I'm glad I got a chance to play Sniper Elite.

3461
03:20:49,280 --> 03:20:51,680
Oh my- that was actually incredibly fun.

3462
03:20:51,740 --> 03:20:53,240
I really enjoyed this game.

3463
03:20:53,780 --> 03:20:57,260
I didn't realize I even played for three hours.

3464
03:20:57,540 --> 03:20:58,460
Oh my god.

3465
03:20:59,440 --> 03:21:04,660
Time really like passed by so fucking fast playing that game.

3466
03:21:04,960 --> 03:21:06,200
Yeah, it was so fun.

3467
03:21:06,280 --> 03:21:08,020
I really actually really enjoyed it.

3468
03:21:08,180 --> 03:21:13,940
Time passed by incredibly fast that I didn't even realize I was playing it for three hours already.

3469
03:21:17,180 --> 03:21:18,360
Focused on my mission.

3470
03:21:18,540 --> 03:21:19,460
I told you.

3471
03:21:19,600 --> 03:21:20,820
I told you eventually.

3472
03:21:22,960 --> 03:21:23,400
Eventually.

3473
03:21:24,340 --> 03:21:26,360
Eventually the shot would hit.

3474
03:21:30,300 --> 03:21:31,400
Thank you for the super chat.

3475
03:21:31,520 --> 03:21:32,240
Thank you, thank you.

3476
03:21:32,500 --> 03:21:34,540
The loss of one ball led to the war.

3477
03:21:34,620 --> 03:21:36,000
The loss of a second ended.

3478
03:21:36,400 --> 03:21:39,260
The cycle of torsion, if you will, is complete.

3479
03:21:39,680 --> 03:21:41,200
Thank you for the super chat.

3480
03:21:41,300 --> 03:21:42,080
Thank you, thank you.

3481
03:21:42,360 --> 03:21:43,720
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

3482
03:21:43,840 --> 03:21:44,380
Thank you, thank you.

3483
03:21:44,380 --> 03:21:46,600
November never felt so dangerous.

3484
03:21:47,060 --> 03:21:49,280
I mean, I only shot two balls.

3485
03:21:49,580 --> 03:21:50,640
Like, I only shot...

3486
03:21:50,640 --> 03:21:52,020
No, I shot three balls today.

3487
03:21:52,420 --> 03:21:54,140
Guys, if you think about it.

3488
03:21:54,360 --> 03:21:57,400
So technically only two people failed the challenge.

3489
03:21:57,740 --> 03:22:00,980
So you have three more days or that's what's gonna happen.

3490
03:22:05,400 --> 03:22:08,000
Oh my god, I had so much fun, guys.

3491
03:22:08,460 --> 03:22:12,620
I hope you guys had a lot of fun watching today.

3492
03:22:12,620 --> 03:22:16,900
I definitely had a lot of fun playing the game.

3493
03:22:17,320 --> 03:22:19,700
I love the slow-mo.

3494
03:22:19,820 --> 03:22:20,860
The slow-mo was...

3495
03:22:20,860 --> 03:22:21,740
I don't know any...

3496
03:22:21,740 --> 03:22:23,940
I don't know why you would ever turn off the slow-mo though.

3497
03:22:24,120 --> 03:22:25,940
Cause that shit was so fucking fun.

3498
03:22:26,200 --> 03:22:27,600
Anyway, submit that...

3499
03:22:27,600 --> 03:22:29,380
Don't submit how many attempts it was.

3500
03:22:29,720 --> 03:22:34,680
But submit that clip where I got the shot for FPS VTuber.

3501
03:22:35,460 --> 03:22:37,100
FPS VTuber of the year.

3502
03:22:37,500 --> 03:22:40,060
That should've been my clip.

3503
03:22:43,100 --> 03:22:46,980
Look, the only reason why I failed some of those shots was the win, chat.

3504
03:22:47,280 --> 03:22:48,600
The fucking win.

3505
03:22:49,120 --> 03:22:52,040
I forgot to compensate for the win.

3506
03:22:54,940 --> 03:22:57,740
It was the win, guys.

3507
03:23:01,400 --> 03:23:04,360
I was the VTuber that ended the war.

3508
03:23:06,260 --> 03:23:07,460
There was win.

3509
03:23:07,920 --> 03:23:10,940
Did you not see how many windows there were, chat?

3510
03:23:10,940 --> 03:23:13,080
Did you not see the windows?

3511
03:23:13,800 --> 03:23:15,580
The guys messed me up.

3512
03:23:16,200 --> 03:23:20,300
The win fucked me up, guys.

3513
03:23:21,000 --> 03:23:21,940
I'm a hero.

3514
03:23:22,040 --> 03:23:24,160
You are talking to a hero right now.

3515
03:23:25,680 --> 03:23:29,020
The amount of times I've killed this man.

3516
03:23:29,220 --> 03:23:31,480
You're talking to a fucking hero.

3517
03:23:40,940 --> 03:23:42,440
I'm tearing up.

3518
03:23:42,700 --> 03:23:50,820
I literally rewinded time to end his bloodline several times, chat.

3519
03:23:51,520 --> 03:23:54,560
So, I am like hero times five at least.

3520
03:23:55,720 --> 03:23:58,400
He went through his own Crown Hog day.

3521
03:23:58,840 --> 03:23:59,760
Yeah, basically.

3522
03:24:00,080 --> 03:24:00,560
Hey, guys.

3523
03:24:00,600 --> 03:24:01,240
You guys didn't know.

3524
03:24:01,680 --> 03:24:04,300
We have less than a week left for Gamer Sups.

3525
03:24:04,720 --> 03:24:07,420
So, after that, it's gone forever.

3526
03:24:07,420 --> 03:24:14,660
So, you won't be able to get these after the week is left.

3527
03:24:15,100 --> 03:24:16,780
So, less than a week, guys.

3528
03:24:16,980 --> 03:24:21,280
And the amount of sales determines if I'll get a flavor or not.

3529
03:24:21,380 --> 03:24:21,720
So, yeah.

3530
03:24:21,840 --> 03:24:23,520
The support really does mean a lot, guys.

3531
03:24:23,560 --> 03:24:25,840
So, thank you so much for buying.

3532
03:24:26,100 --> 03:24:31,860
We already made like almost 6,000 sales already.

3533
03:24:32,020 --> 03:24:33,840
Which is pretty crazy, in my opinion.

3534
03:24:34,400 --> 03:24:35,560
So, thank you, guys.

3535
03:24:35,560 --> 03:24:37,140
On the cups alone.

3536
03:24:37,320 --> 03:24:41,700
Just for the cups, we already sold almost 6,000 on just the cups alone.

3537
03:24:42,000 --> 03:24:43,780
So, thank you, guys, so much.

3538
03:24:43,840 --> 03:24:49,920
It really does mean a lot for those people who bought it.

3539
03:24:50,160 --> 03:24:51,740
And for those who are retweeting it.

3540
03:24:51,820 --> 03:24:52,760
Even if you can't afford it.

3541
03:24:52,960 --> 03:24:55,800
For talking about the Gamer Sup Cup and everything.

3542
03:24:56,020 --> 03:24:57,660
So, I really do appreciate it, guys.

3543
03:24:57,700 --> 03:24:58,680
Thank you, guys, so much.

3544
03:24:59,000 --> 03:24:59,860
Also, if you guys didn't know.

3545
03:25:00,080 --> 03:25:01,840
I was nominated for...

3546
03:25:01,840 --> 03:25:03,780
I don't know about VTuber of the Year.

3547
03:25:03,780 --> 03:25:04,900
But like...

3548
03:25:05,940 --> 03:25:11,440
I got nominated for several nominations for VTuber Awards.

3549
03:25:11,540 --> 03:25:12,820
So, please vote for me.

3550
03:25:13,240 --> 03:25:14,400
And vote for yourself, too.

3551
03:25:14,460 --> 03:25:14,940
For the Fanbase.

3552
03:25:15,660 --> 03:25:16,460
The Dragoons.

3553
03:25:16,800 --> 03:25:17,920
The WrestleTuber.

3554
03:25:19,720 --> 03:25:20,120
Dragoons.

3555
03:25:20,700 --> 03:25:21,100
WrestleTuber.

3556
03:25:21,960 --> 03:25:22,360
FPS.

3557
03:25:22,500 --> 03:25:23,360
VTuber of the Year.

3558
03:25:23,680 --> 03:25:24,600
And VTuber of the Year.

3559
03:25:24,620 --> 03:25:26,320
I'll be very surprised for VTuber of the Year.

3560
03:25:26,440 --> 03:25:27,280
Because like...

3561
03:25:27,280 --> 03:25:29,140
The competition is very, very hard.

3562
03:25:29,300 --> 03:25:30,960
Like, the campaign...

3563
03:25:30,960 --> 03:25:31,480
Oh, my God.

3564
03:25:31,480 --> 03:25:34,000
It feels just like Student Council all over again.

3565
03:25:37,120 --> 03:25:37,600
Like...

3566
03:25:38,220 --> 03:25:41,400
Campaigning people I've been doing for VTuber of the Year was fucking...

3567
03:25:41,400 --> 03:25:41,960
I was like...

3568
03:25:41,960 --> 03:25:42,840
I was like...

3569
03:25:42,840 --> 03:25:43,480
Oh, I'm scared.

3570
03:25:47,440 --> 03:25:47,920
So...

3571
03:25:47,920 --> 03:25:48,360
But, yes.

3572
03:25:48,420 --> 03:25:50,820
I'll make a Twitter post about it tomorrow.

3573
03:25:51,500 --> 03:25:53,420
I don't like doing too many work tweets.

3574
03:25:53,540 --> 03:25:53,840
Like...

3575
03:25:53,840 --> 03:25:54,600
Not work tweets.

3576
03:25:54,660 --> 03:25:55,380
But like...

3577
03:25:55,380 --> 03:25:56,840
Like formal tweets.

3578
03:25:57,860 --> 03:25:58,340
Like...

3579
03:25:58,340 --> 03:26:00,240
Because I already did like three formal tweets today.

3580
03:26:00,240 --> 03:26:02,820
And I don't like doing too many formal tweets a day.

3581
03:26:02,880 --> 03:26:03,640
So, like...

3582
03:26:03,640 --> 03:26:04,340
That's why I'm like...

3583
03:26:05,980 --> 03:26:07,020
If anything...

3584
03:26:07,020 --> 03:26:08,060
If I don't win anything...

3585
03:26:08,060 --> 03:26:10,380
I want you guys to win Fanbase of the Year.

3586
03:26:10,900 --> 03:26:11,420
Because...

3587
03:26:11,420 --> 03:26:12,880
Without you guys...

3588
03:26:12,880 --> 03:26:13,440
Like...

3589
03:26:13,440 --> 03:26:14,560
Still supporting me.

3590
03:26:14,680 --> 03:26:15,560
Since February.

3591
03:26:15,660 --> 03:26:16,600
Even before February.

3592
03:26:17,100 --> 03:26:17,520
And like...

3593
03:26:17,520 --> 03:26:18,300
Being strong.

3594
03:26:18,460 --> 03:26:19,800
And still supporting me.

3595
03:26:20,120 --> 03:26:20,860
In February.

3596
03:26:21,220 --> 03:26:21,940
Until now.

3597
03:26:22,080 --> 03:26:22,340
Like...

3598
03:26:22,340 --> 03:26:22,960
It really...

3599
03:26:22,960 --> 03:26:25,540
You guys deserve like Fanbase of the Year at least.

3600
03:26:25,980 --> 03:26:26,720
So, yeah.

3601
03:26:26,860 --> 03:26:27,720
I really appreciate.

3602
03:26:27,820 --> 03:26:28,300
Also...

3603
03:26:28,300 --> 03:26:28,640
Members.

3604
03:26:28,640 --> 03:26:29,640
Member goons.

3605
03:26:29,840 --> 03:26:31,640
We are going to have...

3606
03:26:33,420 --> 03:26:35,320
Our membership wallpaper.

3607
03:26:35,900 --> 03:26:36,900
Either today or tomorrow.

3608
03:26:37,920 --> 03:26:38,520
Woah.

3609
03:26:39,160 --> 03:26:39,580
Sorry.

3610
03:26:39,900 --> 03:26:40,940
This is the outfit.

3611
03:26:42,180 --> 03:26:44,140
Our outfit for the membership wallpaper.

3612
03:26:44,960 --> 03:26:45,620
So, yeah.

3613
03:26:46,020 --> 03:26:48,000

I don't know if the file is up yet.

3620
03:26:56,480 --> 03:26:56,840
But...

3621
03:26:56,840 --> 03:26:57,100
Yes.

3622
03:26:57,100 --> 03:26:58,780
It is winter themed.

3623
03:26:59,620 --> 03:27:00,220
So...

3624
03:27:00,220 --> 03:27:01,220
So, yeah.

3625
03:27:01,820 --> 03:27:02,780
Look forward to that.

3626
03:27:02,860 --> 03:27:03,580
This is the outfit.

3627
03:27:03,880 --> 03:27:06,100
This is the outfit for the winter...

3628
03:27:07,020 --> 03:27:08,360
For the winter wall...

3629
03:27:08,640 --> 03:27:09,760
For the November wallpaper.

3630
03:27:10,800 --> 03:27:11,680
So, yes.

3631
03:27:12,680 --> 03:27:13,800
Look forward to that.

3632
03:27:14,240 --> 03:27:14,500
Anyway.

3633
03:27:14,620 --> 03:27:15,820
Let me read it.

3634
03:27:16,960 --> 03:27:18,280
Back to this.

3635
03:27:18,740 --> 03:27:19,480
But, yes.

3636
03:27:20,080 --> 03:27:21,160
This is like...

3637
03:27:21,160 --> 03:27:21,720
If you are a member.

3638
03:27:22,260 --> 03:27:23,960
We do monthly wallpaper.

3639
03:27:24,320 --> 03:27:24,920

You can download...

3641
03:27:26,260 --> 03:27:26,800

3642
03:27:26,800 --> 03:27:28,260
You can download all the wallpapers and everything.

3643
03:27:28,560 --> 03:27:29,000
So...

3644
03:27:29,000 --> 03:27:29,280
Yeah.

3645
03:27:29,700 --> 03:27:31,700
Remember to get some free wallpapers.

3646
03:27:32,180 --> 03:27:32,620
Hey, guys.

3647
03:27:32,700 --> 03:27:33,520
I'm gonna call it here.

3648
03:27:33,860 --> 03:27:34,780
I'm gonna rest my voice.

3649
03:27:35,020 --> 03:27:36,580
As always, everybody...

3650
03:27:36,580 --> 03:27:37,440
Stay hydrated.

3651
03:27:37,680 --> 03:27:38,280
Posture check.

3652
03:27:38,460 --> 03:27:39,280
Get up and move around.

3653
03:27:39,380 --> 03:27:39,740
Oh, wait.

3654
03:27:39,880 --> 03:27:41,460
I said I was gonna talk about something after.

3655
03:27:41,980 --> 03:27:42,200
Wait.

3656
03:27:42,200 --> 03:27:42,820
What was it?

3657
03:27:43,180 --> 03:27:45,340
Was it just about like...

3658
03:27:46,260 --> 03:27:46,700
Fucking...

3659
03:27:47,320 --> 03:27:49,260
Wanting to move out of Canada?

3660
03:27:49,760 --> 03:27:50,740
I don't remember.

3661
03:27:50,840 --> 03:27:51,360
I was like...

3662
03:27:51,360 --> 03:27:51,660
Oh, yeah.

3663
03:27:51,660 --> 03:27:54,040
I wanna talk about something more after this.

3664
03:27:54,380 --> 03:27:55,820
I don't remember what it was.

3665
03:27:56,260 --> 03:27:56,620
What was it?

3666
03:27:56,680 --> 03:27:57,320
I don't remember.

3667
03:27:57,880 --> 03:27:59,880
Was it more about moving out of Canada?

3668
03:28:00,160 --> 03:28:01,260
Because I fucking hate...

3669
03:28:02,980 --> 03:28:04,480
Hate how like...

3670
03:28:04,480 --> 03:28:06,000
I can't see a fucking doctor.

3671
03:28:08,640 --> 03:28:09,540
That was it?

3672
03:28:09,740 --> 03:28:11,500
Oh, I think I talked about it most of...

3673
03:28:11,500 --> 03:28:13,460
Most of it in the beginning anyway.

3674
03:28:14,700 --> 03:28:15,200
Yeah.

3675
03:28:15,320 --> 03:28:15,640
Anyway.

3676
03:28:15,880 --> 03:28:16,320
So...

3677
03:28:16,320 --> 03:28:16,520
No.

3678
03:28:16,580 --> 03:28:17,880
I just really hate...

3679
03:28:17,880 --> 03:28:19,820
I just really hate that like...

3680
03:28:19,820 --> 03:28:20,880
I can't see a doctor.

3681
03:28:21,420 --> 03:28:21,980
And like...

3682
03:28:21,980 --> 03:28:22,480
I wanna...

3683
03:28:22,480 --> 03:28:23,320
I've been talking...

3684
03:28:23,320 --> 03:28:24,180
I've been thinking about...

3685
03:28:24,180 --> 03:28:25,700
I literally thought about it today.

3686
03:28:25,900 --> 03:28:27,220
I thought about it today.

3687
03:28:27,220 --> 03:28:28,360
Because I was like...

3688
03:28:28,360 --> 03:28:29,940
Really frustrated about it.

3689
03:28:30,380 --> 03:28:31,280
And everything.

3690
03:28:31,960 --> 03:28:32,400
And then...

3691
03:28:34,300 --> 03:28:35,060
So like...

3692
03:28:35,060 --> 03:28:36,180
I was thinking about like...

3693
03:28:36,980 --> 03:28:37,460
About...

3694
03:28:37,460 --> 03:28:38,080
But I'm not sure.

3695
03:28:38,280 --> 03:28:38,960
I'm not like...

3696
03:28:38,960 --> 03:28:40,400
Literally, I had this thought today.

3697
03:28:40,700 --> 03:28:42,060
So we'll see how it goes.

3698
03:28:42,360 --> 03:28:42,860
We'll see.

3699
03:28:42,940 --> 03:28:43,900
Apparently, they're like...

3700
03:28:43,900 --> 03:28:45,300
Oh, wait until 2025.

3701
03:28:45,580 --> 03:28:46,600
Maybe it'll get better.

3702
03:28:46,960 --> 03:28:47,560
And I'm like...

3703
03:28:47,560 --> 03:28:47,740
What?

3704
03:28:47,760 --> 03:28:49,080
Are we just gonna have like...

3705
03:28:49,080 --> 03:28:52,320
Fucking thousands of doctors suddenly appear in 2025?

3706
03:28:52,320 --> 03:28:53,440
Like...

3707
03:28:54,420 --> 03:28:55,940
Like I'm just...

3708
03:28:55,940 --> 03:28:56,600
I'm like...

3709
03:28:56,980 --> 03:28:58,400
That's not possible.

3710
03:29:01,440 --> 03:29:03,120
USA doctors are...

3711
03:29:03,120 --> 03:29:05,040
But at least you can see them.

3712
03:29:05,260 --> 03:29:07,540
You can't even get an appointment.

3713
03:29:08,440 --> 03:29:09,200
That's...

3714
03:29:09,200 --> 03:29:11,600
It doesn't matter if you have the money.

3715
03:29:12,600 --> 03:29:13,040
You...

3716
03:29:13,040 --> 03:29:15,460
You can't even get an appointment.

3717
03:29:16,460 --> 03:29:18,320
That's the worst part.

3718
03:29:24,100 --> 03:29:24,520
Anyway...

3719
03:29:25,040 --> 03:29:25,960
Anyway, guys.

3720
03:29:26,180 --> 03:29:27,180
That's really it.

3721
03:29:27,280 --> 03:29:28,320
I'm thinking about it.

3722
03:29:28,400 --> 03:29:29,220
But like I said.

3723
03:29:29,340 --> 03:29:31,260
It's not like I'm gonna move right now or anything.

3724
03:29:31,480 --> 03:29:33,060
We'll just see how it goes.

3725
03:29:33,160 --> 03:29:34,960
We'll see how it goes.

3726
03:29:35,400 --> 03:29:35,940
Anyway, guys.

3727
03:29:36,180 --> 03:29:37,080
As always, everybody.

3728
03:29:37,260 --> 03:29:38,060
Stay hydrated.

3729
03:29:38,280 --> 03:29:38,800
Posture check.

3730
03:29:39,020 --> 03:29:40,880
Get up and move around to get that blood flow.

3731
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:41,820
And you stay up for me.

3732
03:29:41,960 --> 03:29:42,760
Head to bed.

3733
03:29:42,860 --> 03:29:43,980
Cause you deserve it.

3734
03:29:44,060 --> 03:29:45,480
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3735
03:29:45,600 --> 03:29:46,440
Bye, guys.

3736
03:29:46,820 --> 03:29:47,240
Bye.
