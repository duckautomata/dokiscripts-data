1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Hello, hello, everyone!

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,920
Kurokori Toki is back, and we are here to blow some bubbles!

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,860
Yes, that's right!

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,480
Today, I am sponsored by Bubble Bobble Sugar Dungeons to
check out their newest game in the franchise.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,280
If you guys didn't know, I've grown up with this game since
I was very little, and even played the Puzzle Bubble series.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,340
So when I saw that they reached out, I told my manager, You
have to say yes!

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,260
And make childhood Toki's dreams come true!

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,020
But yes, it is currently available now on Steam,
PlayStation, and Switch.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:32,660
Yeah!

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,880
As always, Dragons, make sure to click the link in the
description below and try to game out yourself.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,020
Thank you for letting me go back to my childhood and play
Bubble Bubble Sugar Dungeons.

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,040
Okay, enough yapping from this pre-recorded dokey.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,120
It's time to play the game, other pre-recorded dokey.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,040
Thank you for another amazing intro pre-recorded dokey.

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,860
God, you're so good at this.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:01,100
Like I said, I used to play the classic Bubble Bubble games
a lot growing up, and apparently I heard that This blends in

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,120
the classic mechanics with new abilities and the dungeons
are procedurally generated.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,100
So that means there's a lot of replayability.

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,920
So they also have Bubble Symphony for the classic enjoyers
too.

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,640
So for those who remember that game, this is for you.

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,040
All right, let's get into it.

22
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,700
Straight in.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,840
Oh, there's me.

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,040
I'm Bub.

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,460

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,200

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,940
Whoa, you scared me.

Not so fast, Bob.

36
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,000
Think you could start by trying out the training I prepared
for you?

37
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,760
I've been doing this for 30 years, bro.

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,780
I don't need no training.

39
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,500
Alright, basic operations.

40
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Oh.

41
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,660
Okay, that's new.

42
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,480
Usually I would just do this, but oh, now I can just hit it
with my head.

43
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,660
Oh, that's new.

44
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,420

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,020
Okay, oops.

He was so fast.

55
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,420
It could have happened to anybody, guys.

56
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,600

Easy.

00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,240
Blow bubble, you pop bubble.

00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:44,900
That's right.

61
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,740

New counter gate beyond yet.

Oh, it's timed.

78
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,760
I just noticed the timer.

79
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,700
Wait, what's this?

80
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,140
Oh, I have to go to the secret.

81
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,280
There's a secret entrance.

82
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:11,860
Yay.

83
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,260
I assume this is the secret.

84
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,420
Excellent escape.

85
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,660
Oh!

86
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,760
I could have went even further.

87
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,700
I didn't know that.

88
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,980
Wait, I want to go back.

89
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,020
Yeah, try again.

90
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,180
I didn't realize I could go further in the dungeon.

91
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,060
It's not that I didn't know.

92
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,600
I just know that that was the exit.

93
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,640
I just wanted to show you guys the replayability of the
procedural generated dungeon.

94
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,120
Oh my gosh, I'm so smart.

95
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,340
Oh, question mark.

96
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,680
What the question mark do?

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,960
I want to go through the question mark.

98
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,320
Two, three.

99
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,540
Wait, where am I?

100
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:52,760
Oh, oh, oh, um, um, okay, it's fine.

101
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,170
No, guys, I did not lose in a baby level.

102
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,510
How is I supposed to know?

103
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,010
There were 20 plus enemies in front of me.

104
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,510
You're like, oh, Doki, you should have used your abilities.

105
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,270
How is I supposed to know that?

106
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,810
Okay, there's still five more to go.

107
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,970
Oh, I'm running out of time.

108
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,530
I just noticed how little time I have.

109
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,890
Oh, it's up, up, up, up.

110
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,870
That's like all the way to the boss level.

111
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,110
There you go.

112
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,610
All right, 10.

113
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,830
All right, this has to be the boss fight, right?

114
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,210
Oh, it's just extra.

115
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,310
I don't even have like...

116
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,570
Oh, that's right.

117
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,730
Don't got me.

118
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,930
Yeah, I'm not afraid of you.

119
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,570

120
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,130
Get in here.

121
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,890
Get in my bubble.

122
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:40,870
Pop.

123
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,870
That's right.

124
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,170
All your friends are gone.

125
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,570
I popped them all.

126
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:45,710
Yay!

127
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,470
Did it!

128
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,990
Excellent escape.

129
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:50,930
We did it.

130
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,870
We got the dungeon.

131
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,770
That means we unlock a new dungeon, right?

132
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,110
Sayoma!

133
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,110
Yay!

134
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,750
Okay.

Got wooden chest.

136
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,530

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,330

138
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,110

Okay, so, oh, this is the fire drink.

146
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,570
What's the long shot?

147
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,010
Shoot, wait, shoot fire.

148
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,330
Oh, I can shoot fire, but donut.

149
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,410
Oh, the donut is a fast travel.

150
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,590
Wait, I want to try.

151
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,230
I'll try to long shot.

152
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,510
Yeah, another mission complete.

153
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,950
I did it.

154
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,230
I was nice and easy, huh?

155
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,010
I hope my sweets help you keep on adventuring.

156
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,090
Ayompa!

157
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,510
Thanks, Willan.

158
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,810
You're such a huge help.

159
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,090
We know, we have one more special friend who's working hard
to help you out, right?

160
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:50,790
Mm-hmm.

161
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,710
Okay, now do that.

162
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,110
Oh, thanks for contacting me.

163
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,550
Go buy the magic library and you might find feeling a lot
better.

164
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,330
Come on, let's head over there.

165
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,330
Oh, all right.

166
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,490
The library is now open.

167
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,790
The biblioteca.

168
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,070
Oh, it's where I can level my skills.

169
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,130
You can get lots of different powers at the magic library.

170
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:12,950
Oh, okay.

171
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,890
So attack enemies.

172
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,430
Um, I'll do one of each.

173
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,770
I got one of each.

174
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,730
Now my fire is even better now.

175
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,390
Yeah.

176
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,730
I did it.

177
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,610
Oh my God, everybody wants, I'm so popular.

178
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,790
to talk to me.

179
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,130
All three of my friends.

180
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,470
It was fun.

181
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,670
I had a fun time checking out Bubble Bubbles.

182
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,710
Sugar Dungeons.

183
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,830
It was like going back to my childhood.

184
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,550
A lot of nostalgia and everything.

185
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,990
And the popping bubbles and po-yom-pah!

186
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,490
But that's Dragos.

187
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,310

189
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,910
It was such a joy playing it.

190
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,050
It's so cute.

191
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,270
Everything is so cute.

192
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,350
And po-yom-pah!

193
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,530
I will See you guys next time, everybody.

194
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,690
As always, stay hydrated, pause, check, get up, and move
around to get that blood flow.

195
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:09,810
And if you stay up for me to watch this video, head to bed,
because you deserve it.

196
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,910
I'll see you guys next time, Dragons.

197
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,690
Bye-bye.

198
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,170
Plon-yum-pah.

199
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,400
Plon-pah.
