00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,280
Hello?

2
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:54,560
I can't believe I'm willingly playing Five Nights at Freddy's right now.

3
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,300
My manager was like, you did this to yourself.

4
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,040
You live with your consequences.

5
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,400
And now we have to fix your channel!

6
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,480
You did this, Doki.

7
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:26,600
You wanted to play all these obscured, long-ass series.

8
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,380
Now we need you to chase that algorithm!

9
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,680
Dynasty Warriors come with a cause!

10
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,390
And now you gotta play the new FNAF game!

11
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,970
Cause that's what the algorithm wants, Doki!

12
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,030
That's what they want!

13
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,270
And put on those cat ears!

14
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,550
Cause that's what they want too!

15
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,190
Like...

16
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,010
Let's do!

17
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,990
Thank you for the super chat!

18
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,510
Thank you!

19
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:08,950
Thank you!

20
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:09,730
Yippee!

21
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,050
Thank you for the super chat!

22
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,610
Thank you!

23
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,230
Thank you!

24
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:21,570
Speaking of obscured series, how about the Majora's run before July 4th?

25
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,550
Thank you for the super chat!

26
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:22,910
Thank you!

27
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,730
Thank you!

28
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:25,610
Coyote!

29
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:25,910
Coyote!

30
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,750
I gotta fix my channel first, guys!

31
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,230
Coyote!

32
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,530
Thank you for the super chat!

33
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:33,970
Thank you!

34
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,410
Thank you!

35
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,490
It felt like a terror was building after each loop!

36
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,190
Manny, thank you for the super chat!

37
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,510
Thank you!

38
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,010
Thank you!

39
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,070
I even heard this one was actually scary compared to the past!

40
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:45,670
Like, no!

41
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,030
No!

42
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,710
Wait!

43
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:49,690
Okay!

44
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,090
This is also why I'm streaming it in the morning!

45
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,430
I'm already self-sabotaging!

46
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,210
I could have played this at peak NA hours!

47
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,290
But I was like, no!

48
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:06,170
If you want me to play an algorithm game and that is horror, I'm playing it in the morning!

49
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,870
I'm not playing it at night, chat!

50
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,730
I...

51
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,710
This is my...

52
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:12,950
Like...

53
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:13,950
This is...

54
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,630
What's the word?

55
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,950
My part of the deal!

56
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,270
My exception here!

57
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,730
This is...

58
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,570
Like, thank you for the super chat!

59
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,090
Thank you!

60
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:25,590
Thank you!

61
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,450
Speaking of obscured game, how about some godhead!

62
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:30,870
My compromise!

63
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,150
This is my...

64
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,470
Sorry!

65
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,190
I'm...

66
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,590
I'm already so scared that I can't English anymore!

67
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,610
This is my compromise!

68
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,630
I'm playing it in the morning!

69
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,810
I'm gonna try to one-shot this!

70
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,790
Cause apparently it's very short for a $50 game!

71
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,250
I was like...

72
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,590
I was reading the reviews and there...

73
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,910
People were like...

74
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,350
How...

75
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,170
They were like...

76
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:56,310
How are we paying $50 for four hours of gameplay?

77
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,470
And I was like...

78
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,370
Thank fucking god!

79
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,530
I will pay you more money...

80
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,190
To get less of this!

81
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,310
I'll pay...

82
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:06,990
I'll pay...

83
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,110
I'll pay $100 if you manage to make this game two hours!

84
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:12,870
So...

85
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,170
Yeah, apparently it's four to five hours!

86
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,470
So I'm gonna try and one-shot this!

87
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,290
So I don't have to play it next week!

88
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,290
Um...

89
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:21,690
JL!

90
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,530
Thank you to the super chat!

91
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:22,870
Thank you!

92
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,410
Thank you!

93
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,330
Don't be scared!

94
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:24,930
Just...

95
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,730
Alright!

96
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:28,370
Okay!

97
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,530
Before we start...

98
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,430
I have...

99
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:31,970
Um...

100
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,910
A dad update!

101
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,210
So like...

102
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:34,610
Okay!

103
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:35,590
So...

104
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,010
Every passing day...

105
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:38,870
For some reason...

106
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,230
I might actually have to...

107
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,130
Get a personal trainer!

108
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,090
Because...

109
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,490
I don't know what the fuck happened to my dog!

110
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,190
But ever since he broke his back...

111
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,590
He has been getting a...

112
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,550
I feel like he just like...

113
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,430
Life changed for him or something!

114
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,050
Like...

115
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,510
He...

116
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,770
He realized like...

117
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,810
Life is too short!

118
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,430
I'm gonna make it worth my while!

119
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,130
Like...

120
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,370
Like his whole...

121
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,670
Personality...

122
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,570
Started...

123
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,470
Changing...

124
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,330
Every day!

125
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,110
Not changing every day!

126
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,650
I think the better word is that...

127
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,530
He started getting more...

128
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,490
And more...

129
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,090
Bratty...

130
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:12,810
And like...

131
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,610
Ballsy now!

132
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:14,650
So...

133
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,050
So he's like...

134
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:17,690
So he's...

135
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,830
He has realized...

136
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,130
You know...

137
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:19,330
It's like...

138
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:19,850
This like...

139
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,870
Life-changing experience!

140
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,250
And now he's like...

141
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:22,890
That's it!

142
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,210
I'm gonna live my life...

143
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,290
To the fullest!

144
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,670
And like...

145
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,310
Okay...

146
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:28,890
So...

147
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,350
That update...

148
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:30,990
So...

149
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:31,970
Um...

150
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,190
This started yesterday!

151
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,550
And...

152
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,890
Uh...

153
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,470
Basically what happens...

154
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,270
Is that...

155
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,490
Um...

156
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,630
He started stealing...

157
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:40,650
He started stealing...

158
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,670
Other dogs...

159
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,610
Toys now!

160
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,790
In a way...

161
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,690
Where he starts stealing...

162
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:45,970
Other dogs...

163
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,630
Balls!

164
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,410
And he would never do that before!

165
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,470
So...

166
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,190
He is like...

167
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,050
He sees other...

168
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,330
Other dogs...

169
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,010
Playing fetch...

170
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:54,610
And he's like...

171
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,530
I want his...

172
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:56,710
Ball!

173
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,870
He's like...

174
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,570
No!

175
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,870
I wanna play fetch...

176
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:03,570
Too!

177
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,230
And...

178
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,510
It makes him...

179
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,030
Feel alive!

180
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,310
Doki!

181
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:09,470
So...

182
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,970
Basically...

183
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,390
Um...

184
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,830
Today...

185
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,210
Uh...

186
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:13,490
Okay...

187
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,050
Yesterday...

188
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:14,930
It was very scary...

189
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:15,290
Because...

190
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,450
The other dog...

191
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,950
Was a very big...

192
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,930
Black dog!

193
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,370
And I was...

194
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,630
Very scared for him!

195
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,670
I knew what he wanted to do...

196
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,850
Too!

197
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,450
He instantly saw...

198
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,810
The owner brought...

199
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,090
Like...

200
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:27,650
A ball...

201
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,370
To play fetch...

202
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:28,870
With his...

203
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,670
Her dog...

204
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,590
And then he like...

205
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,370
Went to...

206
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,710
Did a beeline...

207
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,030
Towards the other dog...

208
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,190
And started like...

209
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,130
Stalking him...

210
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:36,750
Cause he was like...

211
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,670
You're gonna drop that ball...

212
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,430
And when you drop that ball...

213
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,530
I'm gonna...

214
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,150
Take it!

215
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,490
And I got really...

216
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,130
Fucking scared!

217
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,570
Cause that dog was like...

218
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,190
Four times his size!

219
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,730
He's like...

220
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,430
He's like...

221
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,350
He's like...

222
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:50,830
You...

223
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,570
You think I'm scared of you?

224
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,770
I almost died once!

225
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,030
I don't fear death anymore!

226
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,830
But then I'm like...

227
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,310
No Jokey!

228
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,950
No Dad!

229
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,590
You didn't die!

230
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,750
You were just...

231
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,650
Almost paralyzed!

232
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,290
That is different!

233
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,410
This dog can actually kill you!

234
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,010
Like...

235
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,570
And...

236
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,130
So...

237
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,270
So I had to like...

238
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,110
Pick him up...

239
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,550
And like...

240
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,690
Carry him away...

241
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,070
Cause he...

242
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,050
And also he kept like...

243
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:20,970
He kept like...

244
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,930
Running away from me...

245
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,530
From being picked up...

246
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:22,910
He would like...

247
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,030
Go in circle...

248
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,470
Around the other dog...

249
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,170
To prevent me from...

250
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:27,990
Picking him up!

251
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,930
And then like...

252
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,750
When I pick him up...

253
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,030
And then he sees the other dog...

254
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,550
Playing fetch...

255
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,490
He starts barking...

256
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:32,930
He's like...

257
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,050
No!

258
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:34,770
No!

259
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:35,010
No!

260
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,010
It's my ball!

261
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,030
No!

262
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,970
How dare you prevent me from playing fetch!

263
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,270
How dare you!

264
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,170
Anyway...

265
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:44,890
So...

266
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,130
Okay...

267
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,050
Now today...

268
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,450
Today it got worse...

269
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:47,930
Today...

270
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,550
He realizes...

271
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,450
That like...

272
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,490
I don't like it when he tries to steal other dog's balls...

273
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,270
So...

274
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:56,570
Today...

275
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,070
Uh...

276
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,210
Today...

277
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,310
So this time...

278
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,770
There were little like...

279
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,610
I think they're called Pug Terriers...

280
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,650
They're not Pugs...

281
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,350
They're like...

282
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,690
Bigger than Pugs...

283
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,050
I don't know...

284
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:08,570
But they're like...

285
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,510
Sort of like Pugs...

286
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,550
I don't know what breed they are...

287
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,410
I forgot what they are...

288
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:11,590
Like...

289
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,330
Bulldog Terriers...

290
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,070
I don't know...

291
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,770
Like Pug...

292
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,510
Like they have the Pug face...

293
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:16,930
Sort of...

294
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,110
But like not fully...

295
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,690
They're not like squeezed in tight.

296
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,430
But like, anyway.

297
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,250
Anyway, that doesn't matter in the story.

298
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,610
And someone was like, ugly dogs.

299
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,510
I'm like, no!

300
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,570
Okay, look.

301
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,910
I don't remember what... and maybe they're French bulldogs.

302
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,570
I don't remember.

303
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,190
Anyway.

304
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:38,410
Anyway, so this time, it's not... it's a different dog's ball this time.

305
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,290
And this time, maybe dad could take them.

306
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,730
But I also do not want him to fight them.

307
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,770
But like, you know, they're more of his size this time.

308
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,010
So I'm not as scared.

309
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:55,450
As a fucking giant black dog that could clearly, like, pick him... like, pick him up with his... with his mouth.

310
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,690
And like, maybe like, rip him the pieces.

311
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,070
So I'm not as scared this time.

312
00:11:59,310 --> 00:11:59,690
Anyway.

313
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,310
Um, so the other owner also was trying to play fetch with his dogs.

314
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,350
Like, he had two of them.

315
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,070
And, um, and so he threw the tennis ball.

316
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,850
But, uh, the other two dogs didn't really care about it.

317
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,250
So I was like, alright, whatever.

318
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,590
And then dad was like, watching them.

319
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,290
And...

320
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,750
I was sitting on a bench.

321
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,010
And he was like, watching them.

322
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,890
And he saw that they were like...

323
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,090
Like, you know, he was like, stalking his mark, you know?

324
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:27,850
Like...

325
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,790
You know when people were doing heists?

326
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,070
And they're like...

327
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,330
They, they like, do like, surveillance and scouting.

328
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,810
So he was scouting them.

329
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,010
Like, at first.

330
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:44,090
You know, not like yesterday where he went for the fucking beeline towards the big black dog and try to challenge him.

331
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,670
This time, he was like, scouting.

332
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,030
And just seeing his surroundings.

333
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,950
Seeing when he could, he could like, get in there.

334
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:53,630
Anyway...

335
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,130
So, he, um...

336
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,370
He like, waited.

337
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,050
He actually waited this time.

338
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,050
And...

339
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,570
And he noticed that the other two dogs didn't really care about the ball that much.

340
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,170
So he was like, this is it.

341
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,010
This is my time to shine.

342
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,170
So, he, he just casually...

343
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,970
By the way, yesterday, he was like, running towards the ball and everything.

344
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:24,790
Today, he was like, casually walking over to the ball that was in the middle of the park.

345
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,590
As if like, you know, just be like, this is just my normal stroll time.

346
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,990
Just casually walking forward nonchalantly.

347
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,190
Like, ooh, just gauging my surroundings.

348
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,790
And he grabbed the ball.

349
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,010
He, he, he grabbed the ball.

350
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,290
And then, and then like, briskly walked towards the exit.

351
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,550
Like...

352
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,050
He was like...

353
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:51,830
This is...

354
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,410
It was like a fucking heist.

355
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,970
He actually tried to leave the park.

356
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,530
I've never seen him do that before.

357
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,070
He grabbed the ball.

358
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,550
And then instantly went towards the exit.

359
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,170
And, and he was like...

360
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:04,690
And then...

361
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,270
He was like, come on!

362
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,650
Come on!

363
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,310
And he looked at me and he's like, come on!

364
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,110
Come on!

365
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,870
And then I walked over to him.

366
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,390
Like, to the exit.

367
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,870
And he was like, you're my getaway driver.

368
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,250
What are you standing here for?

369
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,030
Open the door, Doki!

370
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,190
Open the door!

371
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,210
He kept looking at me at the door.

372
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,850
He's like, what are you doing?

373
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,750
We need to go now!

374
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,970
And I'm like, what the fuck?

375
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,110
I even got a picture of him.

376
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,990
Cause I was like, what the fuck are you...

377
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,990
What the fuck are you doing?

378
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,490
That's so stupid!

379
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,250
Holy shit!

380
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,530
Alright, like...

381
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,450
You see, this is the door!

382
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,890
And he's like, come on!

383
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,550
Open the door!

384
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,930
We gotta leave!

385
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:52,450
Save him!

386
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,210
Stuck the car!

387
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,670
He kept...

388
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:07,290
He kept, like, looking at me and the door as if I would fucking open the door for him.

389
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,270
Uh...

390
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,130
He...

391
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,550
Caught in the act.

392
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,170
So, I'm gonna have to get a dog trainer soon.

393
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,010
Because...

394
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:17,950
I don't know.

395
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:24,190
He's getting more and more, like, wild and brattier and braver every day.

396
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,230
And...

397
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,570
And I'm like, I don't know what he's gonna do tomorrow.

398
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:31,630
I...

399
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,050
Like, every day is a new day with him.

400
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:34,450
Um...

401
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,170
Um...

402
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,430
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

403
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:37,770
Thank you.

404
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,250
Thank you.

405
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,930
Your dog is a heister.

406
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,250
He learned from the best.

407
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,390
Thank you for the super chat.

408
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:44,850
Thank you.

409
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,630
Thank you.

410
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,070
Oh, he wants to leave.

411
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:47,330
Okay.

412
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,830
He's like, you're too loud!

413
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,070
Let me out!

414
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,410
Alright, goodbye.

415
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:55,810
Um...

416
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,770
Uh...

417
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,570
But yeah, now...

418
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,090
Yeah, so...

419
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,730
Today was a wild day.

420
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,430
Um...

421
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,190
And I think he's poop shy, too.

422
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,310
I figured...

423
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,930
I realized that he may or may not be poop shy.

424
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,710
Cause if there's too many dogs at the dog park, he refuses to poop.

425
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:12,530
And...

426
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,770
I once stayed at the dog park for an hour yesterday.

427
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,010
I stayed at the dog park for an hour.

428
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,570
Just waiting for him to fucking poop.

429
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,730
And then, like, at that moment, there were so many other dogs there, too.

430
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,710
And all he did was just being a fucking terrorist.

431
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,830
Like, he was terrorizing everybody.

432
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,690
Like...

433
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,470
If he wasn't, like, asking for other owners for pets, he was trying to steal other balls.

434
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:41,830
Like...

435
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,650
He was just stealing other balls!

436
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,450
And he hated every...

437
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,250
Any dog that was bigger than him.

438
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,470
He was like, No!

439
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,190
I refuse to let you be taller than me!

440
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,710
And he would actually...

441
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,530
He was actually scaring other big dogs.

442
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,110
Cause the other big dogs were super curious about him.

443
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,910
And then he...

444
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,930
They would, like, come up to him.

445
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,370
And then he would do, like, the...

446
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,250
You know, like, pulling up his, like, teeth.

447
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:04,750
And he's, like, showing.

448
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,430
He's like, No!

449
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:06,190
No!

450
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:06,870
No!

451
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:09,910
No!

452
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,470
No!

453
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,110
No!

454
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,950
No!

455
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,590
No!

456
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:15,510
No!

457
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,590
And then, like, you know, the bigger dogs would be like, Oh, look...

458
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,110
Look at this cute little cat.

459
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,590
And then when they get too close, he'd, like, bite...

460
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,030
Like, not bite them, but he'd, like...

461
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,890
And then they, like, instantly run away.

462
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,290
He is...

463
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,830
He has a Napoleon complex.

464
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,170
No, he 100% does.

465
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,530
I...

466
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,170
I don't know what to do with him.

467
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,170
Like, he never was, like, that...

468
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,270
What's the word?

469
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,910
He usually was never...

470
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,170
And then I would be like, I'm sorry.

471
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,150
I don't know why he's so angry.

472
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,110
And to be honest, I'd be like, I'm so sorry.

473
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,070
I don't know why he's so angry.

474
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,910
Yeah, he's...

475
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,870
He's never been, like, that territorial and aggressive.

476
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,470
Before.

477
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:58,590
So...

478
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,030
So, I...

479
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,250
That's why I was, like, thinking I have to get a dog trainer.

480
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:02,790
I...

481
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,750
I have no...

482
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,750
Like, ever since he, like, broke his back.

483
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,510
He's a changed man.

484
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,710
He's living each day.

485
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,770
As if, like, there's no consequences anymore.

486
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,590
He doesn't fear anything.

487
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,910
Yeah, he's a grumpy little man.

488
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,250
Anyway, guys.

489
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,990
Today, we are playing Five Nights at Freddy's.

490
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,650
The Secret of the Mimic.

491
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,650
The only Five Nights at Freddy game I played was the first one.

492
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:35,450
So, I have no idea what this game is about.

493
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,250
I heard that this game has been in development for a while now.

494
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,420
And, um...

495
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:46,050
And was it made by the same people that did the security breach?

496
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:46,750
I believe.

497
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,370
I don't know.

498
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,690
I...

499
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,730
I could be lying.

500
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:49,150
I...

501
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,970
I could be making shit up.

502
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,930
I don't fucking know.

503
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,530
Normal Sized Phantom.

504
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,530
Thank you for the Super Chat.

505
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:55,850
Thank you.

506
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,290
Thank you.

507
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,310
Don't worry, Doki.

508
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,850
There's no shame in crying, fear and running in terror.

509
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:04,550
There's so much shame in crying, and fear, and running in terror.

510
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,710
Thank you the Super Chat.

511
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,830
Thank you, Thank you.

512
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,370
Alright, time to play.

513
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,570
Secret of the Mimic.

514
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:19,050
Well, obviously, I assume there's animatronics in here, but also, apparently, there's no Freddy.

515
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,510
So, I think that's... I don't know, that's weird.

516
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,830
A Five Nights at Freddy's game without Freddy.

517
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,270
That's... I don't know.

518
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,790
I don't know how to feel about it.

519
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:35,870
Oh, yeah, and I played... Yeah, but Into the Pit did not feel like an actual... like a regular FNAF game, you know?

520
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,450
But Into the Pit was really good.

521
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:44,310
I really enjoyed Into the Pit, but it didn't feel like an actual FNAF game.

522
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,290
It was like... it was like its own thing in general.

523
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,430
Yeah, I'm like, how am I... where am I?

524
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,610
If I'm not... I'm not at Five Nights at Freddy's.

525
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,570
Where am I?

526
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,110
Five Nights at where?

527
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,430
Oh my god, I'm having existential crisis right now.

528
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,450
Where... Where am I?

529
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,830
Wouldn't it be funny if I just play it at this brightness?

530
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,530
Oh my god, if only... Okay, I'll put a little bit bright.

531
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,350
I'll put it at 60.

532
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,630
Five Nights at Murray's.

533
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,510
Can I put a spin on the run from Monster Formula Series?

534
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,490
That's gone full circle.

535
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,590
Oh, hey, there's... There's... Oh my god.

536
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,770
Scott... No, not Scott.

537
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,730
The purple guy.

538
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:42,130
I was like... No, it's... Fuck.

539
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,890
He was in Dead by Daylight.

540
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,510
Springtrap.

541
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,030
Yes.

542
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:47,870
Okay, guys.

543
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,410
This is... I swear to god, I'm not a poser.

544
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,050
I... I swear to god.

545
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,410
Guys, I'm not... I'm not a poser, guys.

546
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,670
I know my FNAF lord.

547
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,590
That bite of 35.

548
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,750
Yeah, William Afton.

549
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,630
There we go.

550
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,430
There's William Afton.

551
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:08,930
Purple guy.

552
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,810
Leah, thank you for the super chat.

553
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:11,370
Thank you, sir.

554
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,990
Thank you.

555
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,030
Try not to get... It's... Get lost.

556
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,150
It's dark out here.

557
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,190
Guys, I swear to... I'm such a legit fan.

558
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,590
I know all about the bite of 34.

559
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,930
All right.

560
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,710
Toggle.

561
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,110
I'll do press and hold.

562
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,930
Uh... Press and hold.

563
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,630
No head bop.

564
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,730
I don't fucking care about the immersiveness.

565
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,290
What are you talking about?

566
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,270
Fake fans?

567
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:40,550
Sorry.

568
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,990
I meant the bite of 39.

569
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,170
There you go.

570
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,930
That has to be the right number.

571
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,150
Okay.

572
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,210
Oh, nice.

573
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,430
There's not a lot of controls.

574
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,830
Was that the bite of 69?

575
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,090
Oh, that's a different type of bite.

576
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,170
Sorry.

577
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,250
Let me turn the jump scare a little low.

578
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:09,250
I... Look, it's not... I'm not... I'm not cheating.

579
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:14,430
I just don't wanna fucking... Make my ears bleed.

580
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,930
I already had Dad barking in my ears.

581
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,070
Do not bite.

582
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:20,610
Sorry.

583
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,590
That was a different game, guys.

584
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,830
That was Five Nights at somewhere else.

585
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,570
Five... Five Nights at Freaky.

586
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,980
How... Why is that so tiny?

587
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,460
I said yes subtitles.

588
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,540
How does that help anybody?

589
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,540
How... How...

590
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,280
I'm struggling to stay awake.

591
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:51,760
What?

592
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,000
I might as well turn off subtitles.

593
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,400
What?

594
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,620
That's tiny.

595
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,400
Awesome to hear.

596
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,180
Well, listen.

597
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,680
We need you to take one more shift for us.

598
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,520
Since you're our closest... Did I put it at small?

599
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,960
Oh, my God.

600
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,960
Why was that on default?

601
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,040
That size could... should not be on default.

602
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,040
Like, that's barely...

603
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,780
Subtitles for ads.

604
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,960
Alright, I put... I put this down louder.

605
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,200
One of those $25 gift certificates.

606
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,480
How is... That should not be default.

607
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,920
Let me get my second... Sorry.

608
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,040
My above average subtitles.

609
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,460
I need to stop my pay.

610
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,300
I need to stop my pay.

611
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,040
I need to stop my pay.

612
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,260
I love that enthusiasm.

613
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,960
So, anyway, this will be a piece of cake.

614
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,180
Yeah, I didn't even send it anything.

615
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,760
It was default small, but that should not be on default.

616
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,600
It might as well just turn it off.

617
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,280
As for his contract, everything he's been working on for us is now legally ours.

618
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,000
So, we're sending you in to get it.

619
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,360
Our motion sensors indicate that someone is still inside the building, moving around.

620
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,520
Although the signal is a bit erratic.

621
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,180
Oh, we're going to the factory.

622
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,380
Wait, this is like...

623
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,700
Poppy's playtime.

624
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,140
We'll follow up with more instructions soon.

625
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,340
For now, just follow these directions and find your way into that building.

626
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,060
Oh, I hate you.

627
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,880
She's... I hate you.

628
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:14,600
Amazing.

629
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,880
Thanks for being a part of the Fazbear team.

630
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,420
Yay!

631
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,280
Secrets of the Mimic.

632
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,920
The Legally Distinct Factory.

633
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,340
Wait, you're right.

634
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,720
Why am I driving in between...

635
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,140
Oh, I'm a fucking shitty driver.

636
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,860
Why am I driving in between the lanes?

637
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,460
Hor, hor, hor, hor, hor, hor, hor, hor, hor.

638
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,420
You guys don't remember the lore?

639
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,720
Not Five Nights though, but like, my lore.

640
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,300
I once...

641
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:50,940
I once...

642
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,620
For Five Nights at Freddy's.

643
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,720
My first play, the first Five Nights at Freddy's.

644
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,660
My video got demonetized.

645
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,720
Because I said...

646
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,760
Hor, hor, hor, hor, hor.

647
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,840
Too many times.

648
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,220
And then the game thought I was saying whore.

649
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,580
So I got...

650
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,880
I got demonetized for language.

651
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,740
Just cuz the game thought I was saying whore on repeat.

652
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,400
So I'm trying not to do that this time.

653
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,840
I think it was for Into the Pits.

654
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,760
No, it was.

655
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,400
Never mind.

656
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,740
It was for Into the Pits.

657
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,580
Okay, let's fix the controls.

658
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,080
Apply.

659
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,360
Alright.

660
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,780
So I'm trying not to sing it too much this time.

661
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,360
I sang it too many times for that game.

662
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,880
What was it?

663
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,560
Was it graphics?

664
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,580
The fuck it is?

665
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,620
Oh, FPS cap.

666
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,380
60 only?

667
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:45,520
Really?

668
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:51,060
If I'm gonna die, I wanna see it at 140 frames at least.

669
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,560
I wanna see my death in as many frames as possible.

670
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,260
Wow.

671
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,380
Let's see.

672
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,180
Where was this?

673
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,720
Is it an audio?

674
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,620
Oh, there we go.

675
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,240
Why is it on small default?

676
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,200
Sorry.

677
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,440
I'm not compensating.

678
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,700
Oh my god.

679
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:12,960
Sorry.

680
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,560
I keep doing option because my sensitivity is so low.

681
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,220
Okay.

682
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,380
I mean, it's so high.

683
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,860
I'll do a 20.

684
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,190
Ddustino, thank you for the super chat.

685
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:29,490
Thank you.

686
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:29,890
Thank you.

687
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,330
You didn't stream on my birthday, so here's the late super chat.

688
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,290
Have fun with the mimic.

689
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:33,770
Thank you.

690
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,630
Thank you for the super chat.

691
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:34,970
Thank you.

692
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:35,550
Thank you.

693
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,510
Happy birthday to you.

694
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,530
Happy birthday to you.

695
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,330
Happy birthday to you.

696
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,430
Oh my gosh.

697
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:42,730
Sorry.

698
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,890
Your name was a little difficult for me.

699
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,130
Ddustino.

700
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,150
Happy birthday to you.

701
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:48,530
Yeah!

702
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,390
Sorry.

703
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:50,970
I was like...

704
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,290
It was like the...

705
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,910
I was meaning to make sure I said it correctly.

706
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,030
Oh, grab.

707
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:58,490
Alright.

708
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:01,830
It's so low.

709
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,410
Okay.

710
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,130
I'll fix that.

711
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,470
That data diver is your master.

712
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:06,910
Okay.

713
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,270
Oh yeah.

714
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,310
I got age restricted.

715
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,550
Oh yeah.

716
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,970
I got age restri...

717
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,590
That's even worse than demonetization.

718
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,330
They age restricted my VOD.

719
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,350
Because I said whore too many times.

720
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,590
Thank you for the super chat.

721
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:27,930
Thank you.

722
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:28,450
Thank you.

723
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:29,190
Okay.

724
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,150
I'll fix the...

725
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,290
Well, everything's on high already, so...

726
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,950
I'll boost the volume up.

727
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,530
That's even worse than demonetization.

728
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,690
Okay.

729
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,630
I'll turn down the sound effects then, too.

730
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,530
So then the voice can go up.

731
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,470
I'm constantly testing the waters.

732
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:43,870
Yeah.

733
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,230
Alright.

734
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,590
Open sesame.

735
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,890
Hello!

736
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,590
I'm here at five nights at MCM.

737
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,990
Oh, this does remind me of Poppy Plain.

738
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,050
Oh, this does remind me of Poppy Plain.

739
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,750
Is temporarily closed.

740
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:11,050
For all deliveries and work inquiries, the client and deliveries entrance is located around the side of the building.

741
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,710
Can't be that bad.

742
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:15,730
Hello.

743
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,870
Someone's been littering.

744
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,310
What else is over here?

745
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,350
Pretend it down.

746
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,270
Thank you for the super chat.

747
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,210
Thank you.

748
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,430
See you at Offcat.

749
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,930
See you guys at Offcat.

750
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,410
I'll be there on Saturday and Sunday.

751
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:34,270
That's not the side entrance, but there might be free stuff here.

752
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,250
Wait, no, no.

753
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:35,990
These are Freddy.

754
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,090
Excuse me?

755
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,550
I am playing the five nights at Freddy's game.

756
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,470
Where is my Freddy?

757
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,110
Why is there a playground next to the factory?

758
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,530
Who brings their children here?

759
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:52,390
After how many fucking incidents someone keeps bringing their children?

760
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,790
Who's this?

761
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,350
Pardon our mess.

762
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,190
Who are these fucking imposters?

763
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,280
I would never...

764
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:13,600
If I work at something related to, like, Five Nights at Freddy's, I would never bring my child here.

765
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,540
Apparently, there's been, like, quote-unquote, accidents at every, like, Freddy location.

766
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:28,840
At that point, like, I would never bring my children anywhere near five, like, Freddy's.

767
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,080
Unless I have life...

768
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,920
Unless I get life insurance from my child.

769
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,560
Entertainment and carnival game technologies.

770
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,440
Whoa.

771
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,700
Come in and see what Murray's can do for your carnival, amusement park, midway, or fun fair.

772
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,180
Murray's?

773
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,580
Five Nights at Murray's?

774
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,500
This wide tour will show you just what I'm capable of.

775
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,140
Get ready to be amazed.

776
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,240
Don't forget, every one of my creations are available for purchase or lease.

777
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,640
Be yourself.

778
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:01,660
Whoa.

779
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,740
This relates to the book series?

780
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,800
Who fucking reads?

781
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,300
What?

782
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,100
Oh, is that Mr. Helpful?

783
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,900
You're not Fred...

784
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,640
Not my Freddy.

785
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,480
Hashtag.

786
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,220
There's so much to be done.

787
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,240
You want to be here to stay.

788
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,020
It's a one of the kind...

789
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,520
Please stop saying...

790
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,440
...fantasy workshop...

791
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,840
...where you'll quite...

792
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,400
...simply be amazed.

793
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,140
Oh!

794
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:33,800
Oh!

795
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,060
Oh!

796
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,440
Oh!

797
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,320
Oh my god, there's more of you?

798
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,520
Oh, there's a pig.

799
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,000
And there's a crocodile.

800
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,980
Oh my god, where did this guy come from?

801
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,670
This is helpful.

802
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,770
Where's Mrs. Freddy?

803
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,350
Wait, this is better than Freddy.

804
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,950
There's a woman version.

805
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,880
This is my worst nightmare, actually.

806
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,200
If I was a child here, I would fucking cry.

807
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,940
I would cry and just look at the guy.

808
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,900
I did that for...

809
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:19,640
...um...

810
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,540
...it's a small world.

811
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,900
...a world of weights.

812
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,740
Now it's time to explore.

813
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,800
Step right up.

814
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,760
Don't be scared.

815
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,520
Yeah, it's not...

816
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,720
I'm just seeing this every day at work.

817
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,860
You have to watch this every single day.

818
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,060
Before you clock in, you have to...

819
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,920
It's like...

820
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,160
CEO wants you to watch this every day before you go to work.

821
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,850
What a...

822
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,270
...fucking nightmare.

823
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:50,550
Mirror.

824
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,150
Wait, there was like...

825
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,350
Oh, here it is.

826
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:55,990
Light cream.

827
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,630
Time for my daily death anthem.

828
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:02,270
Alright.

829
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,670
I can go to this door.

830
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,030
I know.

831
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,450
You would cry even now.

832
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,530
Sorry, Stigula Super Chat.

833
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:13,870
Thank you.

834
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:14,490
Thank you.

835
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,990
Alright, so I have heard that there is performance issues with this game.

836
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:19,990
And I could feel it.

837
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,390
So maybe...

838
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,570
Oh my god, I'm on media?

839
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,370
We don't need reflections.

840
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,430
We...

841
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:31,910
Yeah.

842
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,960
Okay.

843
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,640
Oh, hey.

844
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,180
Hey, there's Freddy.

845
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,680
Red Bear's family diner.

846
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,660
There we go.

847
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,440
That's the only time we'll ever see Freddy.

848
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,560
Imagine.

849
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,360
I don't think I have this.

850
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:55,720
I don't think I have this.

851
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,060
Is a square a diamond?

852
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,540
If...

853
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,200
If I rotate that square a little bit.

854
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,680
Oh.

855
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,560
Mail time.

856
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,160
What's in my mail?

857
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,180
How do I check my mail?

858
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:14,840
No mail?

859
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:14,880
Huh?

860
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,980
Oh my god.

861
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,020
I have no fans.

862
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,440
I have no friends or family.

863
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,060
I'm alone.

864
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,580
Jesus Christ.

865
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,280
That shit is fucking scary.

866
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:24,980
Holy...

867
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,180
I don't like that.

868
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,720
I don't like that at all.

869
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:30,860
Hello?

870
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,240
Oh my god.

871
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,520
How does this bring children joy?

872
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,200
I...

873
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,660
How does that bring kids joy?

874
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,620
Oh.

875
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,440
Oh, I hate this.

876
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,340
I don't understand how that can ever give you joy.

877
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,040
Alright.

878
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,080
Generator time.

879
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

880
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,160
Whoa.

881
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,720
Hello?

882
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,140
Hello?

883
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,400
You're there.

884
00:33:59,580 --> 00:33:59,920
Pick up.

885
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,640
Hello, hello?

886
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,500
This is my purple guy?

887
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,940
Sorry, my blue guy?

888
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,280
In Five Nights at Murray's?

889
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,860
Recover the Fazbear property.

890
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,300
Mr. Helpful.

891
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,100
Where am I?

892
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,820
Okay, I'm at the security office now.

893
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,480
Oh shit, what year is this?

894
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,800
Here, I finally found the missing...

895
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,240
Pieces of this stupid power device.

896
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,860
Just got to head over there and turn the power on.

897
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,200
I'll check on it soon.

898
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,640
Okay.

899
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,880
Run this.

900
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,800
What the fuck?

901
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,200
I'll go to my bed.

902
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,360
Sure.

903
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,960
Never again?

904
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:48,600
Why?

905
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,560
Okay, please.

906
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,220
Give me a sec.

907
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,400
I'm playing a video game.

908
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:54,960
19...

909
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,660
Is this the...

910
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,600
This is the Bite of 87!

911
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,060
Apparently, I read that...

912
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,100
That Bite of 87 was not even important at all.

913
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,760
Look at the actual lore of FNAF.

914
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,620
That, like, blue...

915
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,460
That, like, changed everything for me.

916
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,460
Dear Moon, can you bring back the sun?

917
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,970
Open closet?

918
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:26,410
Hello?

919
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,010
Is there anybody in the closet?

920
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,690
You hear the gnashing of teeth?

921
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,570
Am I alive?

922
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,190
The thing pulls you to that moon.

923
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,990
Who screams back to bed!

924
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,270
Everything fades to black.

925
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,990
Oh, it's like a mini FNAF game.

926
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,290
Give me a sec.

927
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,770
I'm playing a video game.

928
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,550
I run parachute.ex.

929
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:53,470
Alright.

930
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,330
Hello?

931
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:57,850
Yes?

932
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:03,990
You mean, there's more than one bite?

933
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,790
Who the fuck keeps...

934
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:13,210
Who the fuck keeps going to Five Nights at Freddy's?

935
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,170
Who keeps going to Freddy Fazbear?

936
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,490
This place should be bankrupt.

937
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:30,830
We have a little bit of an idea as to what it might be.

938
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,950
That happened at Disneyland?

939
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:33,770
It's over.

940
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,670
How much money does Freddy Fazbear Pizzeria has?

941
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,890
They have real...

942
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,410
Toki, you don't understand.

943
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,750
They have really good pizza.

944
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,270
But you should probably worry about it.

945
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,790
He was working on an endoskeleton...

946
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,990
When fucking Mickey Mouse bites a child's head open?

947
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,110
I do not think Disneyland would live through that.

948
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,370
It would be closed down for like...

949
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:04,010
Fuck.

950
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,450
Like all Disneyland's would be closed down.

951
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:10,190
But we'll be working on some ideas on how to neutralize this group under skillset.

952
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:15,550
But in the meantime, just try to be quiet, careful, and focused on the task at hand.

953
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,090
Alright.

954
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:23,370
Always being mindful of the fact that this entity could potentially be inside any costume or character that you see.

955
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,070
Alright, take a deep breath and get back in there.

956
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:27,970
Finish the job.

957
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,670
And that $25 gift certificate is as good as it is.

958
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,150
Oh my god.

959
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,730
$25 gift certificate.

960
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,330
Bro, minimum wage hitting hard right now.

961
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,050
Let's fucking go.

962
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:47,210
I could use it to get that good fucking pizza you guys keep talking about.

963
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:03,770
Guys, I can buy two pizzas with that $25 at Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria.

964
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:10,110
Uh, Lali, NCG, thank you for the super chat.

965
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,130
Thank you, thank you.

966
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:11,790
Whee!

967
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:18,530
Okay, so I need basic security, repair, creator, admin, execs.

968
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:19,690
What's in here?

969
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,750
Oh, I can't do anything here yet.

970
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,590
Can I do anything here?

971
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,430
No.

972
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,170
Oh.

973
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:28,470
Oh, wait.

974
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,630
That gives me the diamond.

975
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,390
I assume.

976
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,670
$25 before...

977
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:34,990
You're right.

978
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,510
That's like at least $100.

979
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:38,810
Rosie, thank you for the super chat.

980
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:39,550
Thank you, thank you.

981
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,270
Upgrade, please.

982
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,430
They're starting to bring dinosaurs back.

983
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,770
And we have movies saying that's a bad idea.

984
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,590
Yes, if this happened at Disney, they just rolled with it.

985
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,730
They just sued the parents for negligence.

986
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,330
What am I supposed to do?

987
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,050
What?

988
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,730
Move to high track?

989
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:04,970
How did I fail?

990
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:05,690
I...

991
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:06,910
Okay.

992
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,470
Oh, I'm supposed to go down.

993
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:25,850
I'm a little stupid.

994
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,170
Okay, I figured it out.

995
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:31,010
I was confused with what this game was.

996
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,410
If it was a game.

997
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:36,510
Wait, no.

998
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,390
I was supposed to move to high.

999
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,790
No, I was supposed to make them all...

1000
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,070
Okay, never mind.

1001
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,450
Okay.

1002
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,430
Now I understand what this game is.

1003
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,110
Okay.

1004
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,790
I thought...

1005
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,830
I thought zero was better than one.

1006
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,790
Now I understand what this game is.

1007
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,970
Sorry, I was lying before.

1008
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,170
But this time, I understand.

1009
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,470
I didn't realize that there was...

1010
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,170
It says, flip all bits to one.

1011
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:06,730
Yay!

1012
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:07,770
First try.

1013
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:13,290
I'm so...

1014
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,270
Thank you for the super chat.

1015
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,130
Thank you, thank you.

1016
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:18,470
You can't sue us for letting our dinosaurs eat your child.

1017
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,110
You subscribed to Disney Plus...

1018
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,310
Four years ago.

1019
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,730
Thank you for the super chat.

1020
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:24,650
Thank you, thank you.

1021
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:28,570
What the fuck?

1022
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:29,690
Were these my footprints?

1023
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,670
I don't like how he's just standing there.

1024
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:34,050
Oh.

1025
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,570
Oh my god.

1026
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,590
How does this bring a child joy?

1027
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,910
There was something back here.

1028
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:42,410
I remember.

1029
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,560
Okay.

1030
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,920
I know that there was a door right here.

1031
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,820
Hello.

1032
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,140
Hello, little...

1033
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,680
Hello, little guys.

1034
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,420
Big men.

1035
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,020
Big guys.

1036
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,120
Why would you put this guy here?

1037
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,040
Not even...

1038
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,520
Part of security.

1039
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,600
What is he?

1040
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,940
Is this a pleasure?

1041
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,200
No, I just...

1042
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,620
Turn it down.

1043
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,540
Oh, it is a puzzle.

1044
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,400
Whoops.

1045
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,820
Don't worry.

1046
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,400
I didn't break it.

1047
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,580
It is a puzzle.

1048
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,260
Oh my god.

1049
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,580
This is Poppy Playtime.

1050
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,820
We're gonna have to take it here?

1051
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,360
Okay.

1052
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,180
I'm gonna take it here.

1053
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,500
But what if I do it here?

1054
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,720
Oh my god, the mouse controls for this is a little wonky.

1055
00:41:59,220 --> 00:41:59,940
There we go.

1056
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,860
That should be it.

1057
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,240
Yeah.

1058
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,520
My brain is turning.

1059
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:06,820
There you go.

1060
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,520
I fixed it.

1061
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:09,960
Yeah.

1062
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,380
It's supposed to go over here, right?

1063
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,540
Yeah, there you go.

1064
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,240
Who the fuck brought this guy here?

1065
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,280
Why is he part of security?

1066
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,200
Wait, was he over here?

1067
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:30,580
Whoops.

1068
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,080
I think it was supposed to be something here.

1069
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,580
Oops.

1070
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,100
That's who was he looking at him.

1071
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,220
It must have been the win.

1072
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,640
I was like, why was there scary music?

1073
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,580
I'm sorry.

1074
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,140
I couldn't help look at him.

1075
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,040
Like, I'm like, why is he here?

1076
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,720
Why the fuck would I look out the window after?

1077
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,380
Okay, all I'm saying, when I finish this puzzle, why would I turn around?

1078
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:23,530
Alright.

1079
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,810
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

1080
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,350
There's a dead body in there.

1081
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,470
You want me to go back in this room?

1082
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,370
Yeah, it was the win.

1083
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,250
That was quick.

1084
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:48,170
I did it.

1085
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,310
Nine of yellow paint.

1086
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:50,770
Exactly.

1087
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:52,430
They smeared the window with yellow paint.

1088
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,130
I would have known.

1089
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,910
How's it sound so far, sound guy?

1090
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:00,030
But that doesn't mean the idea isn't sound or valuable.

1091
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,290
We think that endoskeleton has a lot of potential.

1092
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,990
And that's why we want you to retrieve Murray's original schematic for it.

1093
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:07,670
Oh!

1094
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,030
And after you find that schematic for us, we can certainly...

1095
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:12,190
I am Disney!

1096
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:16,030
I'm stealing other people's ideas and claiming them as my own.

1097
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:19,030
If that's not incentive enough to find the schematic, then I don't know what is.

1098
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:20,950
Get that schematic.

1099
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:25,530
And with some luck, you can deactivate that endoskeleton and collect it for us as well.

1100
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:29,330
I can just smell that $25 gift certificate, can't you?

1101
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,550
Oh my god.

1102
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,150
He didn't pattern it.

1103
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,350
Goink, it's mine now.

1104
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,430
This is five...

1105
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:37,850
It's like Oswald!

1106
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:39,930
You can't get anywhere near it.

1107
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,490
We're Oswald-ing!

1108
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:46,230
We just need to find stations to upgrade your data diver until you can gain access.

1109
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,670
They're all over the facility.

1110
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:51,650
In fact, there's a station up in the warehouse manager's office.

1111
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,130
You should head there next.

1112
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:56,850
And before you go, take a handcrank for the security fence.

1113
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:58,030
What's the handcrank?

1114
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,690
Looks like you can get one from the inventory tube system.

1115
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:00,870
Oh, this one.

1116
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,830
That's the big machine in the security office.

1117
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:07,170
Should be active now.

1118
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:10,650
Alright.

1119
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,270
Wait, was this a 3D printer?

1120
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:14,650
In 1980s?

1121
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:18,290
Oh, wait.

1122
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:18,670
Whoops.

1123
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:19,490
Grab this.

1124
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,270
Okay, tools.

1125
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:22,970
I'll make a crank.

1126
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,250
3D print my crank!

1127
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:28,510
Nice.

1128
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,850
Now, what are you waiting for?

1129
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:30,930
Keep on trucking.

1130
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:32,270
Alright.

1131
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,750
Surely nothing bad's gonna happen to me after that scary wind.

1132
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,230
Alright, they're right here.

1133
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,450
Here we go.

1134
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:42,530
We're cranking.

1135
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:48,170
I feel like these mouse controls are gonna fuck me over.

1136
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:48,690
Whoa!

1137
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:49,290
What?

1138
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:53,050
Guys, do you think he's friendly?

1139
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:53,970
Do you think he's friendly?

1140
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,110
Do you think he's friendly?

1141
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:56,110
Please open the door.

1142
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,050
Please open the door.

1143
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:58,030
Please open the door.

1144
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:00,530
Whoa!

1145
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,430
I didn't think he would actually come over!

1146
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:07,190
What's he gonna do?

1147
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,250
Open the door?

1148
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:09,330
That's right.

1149
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,890
I know you can't open doors.

1150
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:13,530
That's what you...

1151
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:13,910
What are you gonna do?

1152
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:14,470
Watch this.

1153
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:15,850
That's right.

1154
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:16,910
What you gonna do?

1155
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:17,830
Nothing.

1156
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:18,130
Everything.

1157
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:20,550
That's right.

1158
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:21,510
You're coming.

1159
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:25,710
Watch this.

1160
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:27,330
What you gonna do?

1161
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:28,830
You can't open this.

1162
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:30,230
That's right.

1163
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:33,410
That's right.

1164
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:36,890
Can't even do anything when the door is open.

1165
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:37,790
Come on.

1166
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:38,850
Come on.

1167
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:41,570
Stupid.

1168
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:41,810
Stupid.

1169
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:46,910
Look at him.

1170
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:48,370
Waddling back.

1171
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:51,950
Alright, nice.

1172
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:52,370
I'm safe.

1173
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:54,350
He's afraid of dwarves.

1174
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:55,270
He's like a vampire.

1175
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:58,870
You gotta like... You gotta let him in.

1176
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:01,970
Gus, thank you for the super chat.

1177
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:02,350
Thank you.

1178
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:02,930
Thank you.

1179
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:08,770
The mimic behind Doki waiting to kill her while she fails at flipping the zeros on one.

1180
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,130
He's too big.

1181
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:10,810
Look at him.

1182
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:12,630
He can't even fit a door.

1183
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:21,940
That's right.

1184
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,620
Let me look out the window at you.

1185
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:28,720
Alright.

1186
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,840
I got away from the go left side.

1187
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:33,680
Bro.

1188
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,600
What do you mean it was close?

1189
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,640
I literally stepped... took one step back.

1190
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:40,620
The fuck?

1191
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,340
How am I supposed to...

1192
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,100
He's just camping me.

1193
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:49,470
What the fuck?

1194
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,880
What am I supposed to do?

1195
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:00,780
Bro.

1196
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:01,120
Okay.

1197
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,220
He is fucking fast.

1198
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,180
As hell.

1199
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:03,920
Oh my god.

1200
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,880
That guy is so fucking fast.

1201
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:07,580
Like...

1202
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,040
Wait.

1203
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:09,860
Why do I...

1204
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,820
Excuse me.

1205
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,240
I have a big ass elephant outside my door.

1206
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,240
What do I...

1207
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:15,720
Excuse me.

1208
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,580
Talk to me.

1209
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,340
This is very important information.

1210
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,440
Pick up the phone.

1211
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,600
Pick up the phone.

1212
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,160
Okay.

1213
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,120
Alright.

1214
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,300
Okay.

1215
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,220
Maybe I taunted him too much.

1216
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,680
We have an actual problem.

1217
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,260
Hello?

1218
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,040
Human resources?

1219
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:48,940
Okay.

1220
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,100
I think he's gone now.

1221
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,140
I think he's gone?

1222
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:55,460
Okay.

1223
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,040
Never mind.

1224
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,120
He's just...

1225
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,700
Looking at his...

1226
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,620
At his friend.

1227
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,100
Okay.

1228
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:01,300
Wait.

1229
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,220
Maybe I'll hold it.

1230
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:03,660
Hello?

1231
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,480
Why did he...

1232
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,460
Why did he stop picking up the phone?

1233
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:14,870
Alright.

1234
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,590
Maybe I'll go the other way.

1235
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:19,310
Not his problem.

1236
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:23,150
Wait.

1237
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:23,630
What?

1238
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,090
What do I...

1239
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:28,730
Do I have to...

1240
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:29,410
Oh my god.

1241
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:31,310
Oh my god.

1242
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:31,750
Do I...

1243
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:32,450
Is this stealth?

1244
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:33,510
Is this...

1245
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:37,570
Okay.

1246
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:43,550
Oh my god.

1247
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:44,430
It's stealth.

1248
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,420
Wait.

1249
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,660
Do you think he'll see me if I'm here?

1250
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:52,960
No, right?

1251
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,200
I'm behind some boxes.

1252
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,340
He sees me?

1253
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:01,900
No, wait.

1254
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,780
He sees me, right?

1255
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:07,090
Hello?

1256
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:16,890
Okay.

1257
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,440
I don't know how he didn't get me, but okay.

1258
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,300
That's right.

1259
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,340
I got a plushie now.

1260
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,160
Watch this.

1261
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,480
Okay.

1262
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,500
Okay, that's...

1263
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,160
That was...

1264
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,720
That was...

1265
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,500
Okay.

1266
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:49,820
I...

1267
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:54,320
Okay.

1268
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,620
I didn't think he would go through the door because he didn't go through the other door.

1269
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,300
I...

1270
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,580
Okay, look.

1271
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,600
He didn't go through the other door.

1272
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,440
I thought they just don't go through doors.

1273
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,720
That's where I interpret it.

1274
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,900
Okay, let me...

1275
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,280
At least I'm back here.

1276
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,100
Alright.

1277
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:21,940
Yay.

1278
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,300
Let's see if I have an email.

1279
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,300
I met.

1280
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:28,360
What?

1281
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,480
Aww.

1282
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,380
Still no friends.

1283
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,340
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

1284
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:37,740
Thank you.

1285
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,480
Thank you.

1286
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,720
I fucking...

1287
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,440
I just thought, you know...

1288
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,380
You didn't get through the other door.

1289
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,080
Maybe...

1290
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,380
Maybe it'll also work here.

1291
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,440
I'm going through this toy.

1292
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,360
You just gonna...

1293
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,840
Am I just gonna hold it for forever?

1294
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,960
What am I supposed to do with this?

1295
00:51:59,140 --> 00:51:59,540
Hello?

1296
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,720
There's too many entrances now.

1297
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,180
Oh, no.

1298
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,280
My worst fear.

1299
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:09,900
Choices.

1300
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,360
Okay, I can't go anywhere, though.

1301
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,180
And then...

1302
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:22,560
Ta-da!

1303
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,080
Okay, I gotta find a password.

1304
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,960
And there's lockers.

1305
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,160
I don't put it in...

1306
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,700
I don't think I can put it in the inventory.

1307
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,200
I'm just gonna be holding it forever.

1308
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,680
I don't have an inventory.

1309
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,420
Marie's Costume Manor.

1310
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,280
What's this?

1311
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,700
Number 5.

1312
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,400
Oh, it's an elevator.

1313
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,440
Alright.

1314
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,880
I don't have that.

1315
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,580
I don't have access to anything.

1316
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:51,620
I don't have access to anything.

1317
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:55,760
Salia.

1318
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:56,580
Uh...

1319
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,120
Salajah.

1320
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:57,900
Thank you for...

1321
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,780
Welcome to the Mayo Farm.

1322
00:52:58,940 --> 00:52:59,400
Welcome, welcome.

1323
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,280
Alright.

1324
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,360
Let's go to the elevator.

1325
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,740
It's just one floor?

1326
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,340
What kind of elevator is this?

1327
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:14,610
I can't put it anywhere.

1328
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,760
The elevator is broken.

1329
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,180
That doesn't sound good.

1330
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,400
Oh.

1331
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,220
I don't like that.

1332
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:29,180
Mmm.

1333
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,300
Really don't like that.

1334
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,500
Come in bigger sizes?

1335
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,520
What?

1336
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,580
Oh, no free drink.

1337
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,620
There's so many doors.

1338
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,160
There's so many doors.

1339
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:45,520
There's so many doors.

1340
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:46,960
There's so many doors.

1341
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,680
I'm not going in there.

1342
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:48,940
Oh, wait.

1343
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,580
Is that safe room?

1344
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,320
Oh, thank God.

1345
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,420
That's another safe room.

1346
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:55,440
Am I just going to hold this forever?

1347
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,200
Okay.

1348
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,420
I can grab this.

1349
00:53:59,040 --> 00:53:59,520
Helper.

1350
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,740
Uh, map.

1351
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:02,440
Where am I?

1352
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,580
I'm going to pretend I know how to read this.

1353
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,700
Uh, logs.

1354
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,040
Hey, everyone.

1355
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,900
These mailboxes are everywhere.

1356
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,640
If you see something strange, then keep the group informed.

1357
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,340
Great idea, Pete.

1358
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,440
Mr. Murray hasn't used these mailboxes for so long.

1359
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,700
It should be safe.

1360
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,840
I'd love to have some place for all of us to talk in private.

1361
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:30,420
I feel like the boss man is listening to us all the time.

1362
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:34,900
Alright.

1363
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,340
Apparently, I could...

1364
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,700
put this in here?

1365
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,480
How do I put that in here?

1366
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,620
Okay.

1367
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:43,240
Okay.

1368
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:43,900
Let me open this.

1369
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:44,800
Let me open this.

1370
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,900
Oh, downloading.

1371
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:47,640
Oh!

1372
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:48,260
Okay.

1373
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,720
Repair permission.

1374
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,320
Okay.

1375
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,900
What am I repairing?

1376
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,390
Oh, it's this.

1377
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,530
Uh...

1378
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:07,960
Uh...

1379
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,820
Am I doing it?

1380
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,120
I don't think I'm doing it.

1381
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,320
I'm doing it.

1382
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,620
Uhhh...

1383
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,380
Okay.

1384
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,800
Oh no, not puzzles.

1385
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:30,860
Not puzzles.

1386
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,020
Oh my god, not puzzles.

1387
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,480
Oh no!

1388
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,120
Okay, I have to do it again.

1389
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,640
Oh fuck, I have to do all of this again.

1390
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:46,980
No!

1391
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,880
Alright, I got this.

1392
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:58,940
Also, I know I asked Sound Guy what he thought about the sound, but then like, I didn't read his answer.

1393
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,480
I know, I'm trying to... I'm using my brain as best as I could.

1394
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,340
It's not that good, but like, at least I'm trying... Oh fuck!

1395
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:11,520
Oh fuck!

1396
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,120
Whoops.

1397
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:18,660
Okay, it's fine.

1398
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,700
Okay, I figured it out.

1399
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:29,850
Fuck!

1400
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,270
I can't...

1401
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:35,130
Why did I put it on...

1402
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:40,090
Sorry, that was my bad.

1403
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,720
I can't...

1404
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,320
I can't...

1405
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,540
There we go, there we go.

1406
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:55,500
I keep turning them into zeros instead of ones.

1407
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,500
Because I feel like, haha, zero is better, because it's infinite.

1408
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,880
You know when you're like, you can't divide by zero?

1409
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,920
I keep thinking I should put in zero.

1410
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,040
There we go.

1411
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,460
Less is more!

1412
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,820
Okay, now I...

1413
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,340
I don't know what I repaired though.

1414
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:20,820
Oh, did I turn this in?

1415
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,120
Yeah?

1416
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:26,010
Oh, nice.

1417
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:27,290
Where did I put this?

1418
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:28,470
Oh, here!

1419
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:31,470
Alright, in you go.

1420
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,550
I'll put you in here too.

1421
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:36,730
My little collectible.

1422
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:42,620
Is that it?

1423
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,280
What...

1424
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,580
What else can I get from here?

1425
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,920
Oh yeah, it is my collectible.

1426
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:48,680
Okay.

1427
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,820
That's why I un-3D printed my collectible.

1428
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,000
I don't even know what I repaired.

1429
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,860
Guys, do I go into the deep, dark hole filled with animatronics?

1430
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,760
Or do I just use my crank?

1431
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,280
Oh, I have to make another crank.

1432
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:12,820
Forgot the elephant man took my crank.

1433
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,520
Oh.

1434
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,280
I just looked at it.

1435
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:17,620
I was like...

1436
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,200
Where...

1437
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:18,840
Where did it go?

1438
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,520
Where did it go?

1439
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,180
Alright.

1440
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,160
Oh!

1441
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,480
It's a storage machine!

1442
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:30,400
Oh!

1443
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,320
It's not a 3D printer.

1444
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,180
I was like...

1445
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:37,220
I was like...

1446
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:37,520
Where crank?

1447
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,200
Alright.

1448
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,580
Into the hole I go.

1449
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,200
Where every hole there is a goal.

1450
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:46,200
Hello?

1451
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,320
Let's crank this...

1452
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,140
Cranky box.

1453
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,620
Is that the mimic?

1454
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,280
Hello?

1455
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,880
I don't think I will.

1456
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:00,960
What the?

1457
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,780
What's over here though?

1458
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,600
Oh, it's just nothing.

1459
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,060
She's gonna...

1460
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,260
She's gonna...

1461
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,820
Try and kill me, isn't she?

1462
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,220
Is that the mimic of 39?

1463
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,840
That won't come back to fucking kill me.

1464
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,280
Oh!

1465
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,500
Let's play!

1466
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,480
Red bear's family diner.

1467
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,660
She has...

1468
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,220
I mean...

1469
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:34,840
She has...

1470
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,360
Very long hands.

1471
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,680
Ready to execute.

1472
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,680
I don't even hear that.

1473
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:45,170
Oh.

1474
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:48,350
These are all the other animatronics that's gonna fucking kill me.

1475
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:51,510
Who's in here?

1476
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:55,570
Hello?

1477
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,050
Are you a good guy?

1478
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:07,810
What?

1479
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:12,030
I don't have any mail.

1480
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:14,190
Do you need a snappy delivery?

1481
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:16,770
That's why I don't have mail.

1482
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,710
I told you guys I have friends.

1483
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,050
It's just that guy keeps fucking up my deliveries.

1484
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,150
I told you.

1485
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:24,490
Look, see?

1486
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:26,030
He's shredding all my mail.

1487
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:28,010
Guys, I swear to God I...

1488
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:31,110
Crank, Crank, Crank, Crank, Crank, Crank!

1489
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:31,910
Crank!

1490
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:37,150
Oh my god!

1491
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:38,090
How do I...?

1492
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:39,490
How do I...?

1493
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:44,830
Holy...

1494
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:46,270
Is he...?

1495
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:46,970
What?!

1496
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:48,610
He's getting closer?!

1497
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,860
Oh, okay.

1498
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,200
Okay, it's not me.

1499
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,120
He's it, not me.

1500
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,000
Oh!

1501
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,040
Oh!

1502
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:13,640
Oh!

1503
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:13,740
Oh!

1504
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:13,940
Oh!

1505
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:17,680
Did you guys notice that I started cranking it faster?

1506
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,720
Why did she throw it up?

1507
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:26,000
I was just like leisurely cranking it.

1508
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,360
And then I was Mach 7.

1509
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:32,940
What?

1510
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,180
Was she above me?

1511
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,220
No, we're fine.

1512
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,500
Okay, I was gonna...

1513
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,840
Because I was gonna tab up and look at what sound guys said.

1514
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:55,600
Oh, they didn't say anything about the sound, so that means we're good to go.

1515
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,000
I don't know, I heard a strange noise.

1516
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:04,380
And like all horror movie characters, we don't walk away.

1517
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,100
We walk towards the scary sound.

1518
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:10,940
So we can pad the time.

1519
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:17,360
Fine, she's not gonna get me.

1520
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,720
I can leisurely enjoy my surroundings.

1521
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,100
She's not even chasing me!

1522
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:26,720
Why would I need a run?

1523
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:30,400
I can enjoy my surroundings.

1524
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,360
Look at that, I made it.

1525
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:33,980
That easy.

1526
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:40,620
Look at that.

1527
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,260
I knew she wouldn't get me.

1528
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,420
She has no legs.

1529
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,900
The seconds before disaster.

1530
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:53,240
Oh, maybe I have to run now.

1531
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:56,660
Oh, I think this time she definitely is gonna kill me.

1532
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:57,420
I...

1533
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,280
Oh, yep!

1534
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:00,380
That looks like run!

1535
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:01,920
Wow!

1536
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,100
Did you guys see the text that says, Maybe you should run?

1537
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:07,720
Alright.

1538
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:09,820
Oh!

1539
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:09,980
No!

1540
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:10,400
No!

1541
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,920
I thought I could run backwards.

1542
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:17,760
I...

1543
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:23,180
I didn't realize you can't run backwards.

1544
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,460
I just wanted to look at it.

1545
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:31,720
Now I know.

1546
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:32,500
Whoa.

1547
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:32,600
Whoa.

1548
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,180
Okay, there we go.

1549
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:34,720
It's fixed.

1550
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,420
This is like, whoa.

1551
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,060
Alright.

1552
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:39,980
Oh, it's this way!

1553
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,560
I was waiting for the door to the screen!

1554
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:48,780
Okay, here we go.

1555
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,280
Oh, my God.

1556
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:52,300
Oh, my God.

1557
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,240
The friends!

1558
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:54,640
The friends!

1559
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:55,460
Jackie!

1560
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,940
Give me back my friends!

1561
01:03:59,240 --> 01:03:59,700
Oh!

1562
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,220
Okay, don't look back!

1563
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:01,980
Don't look back!

1564
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,140
Come back, Toki!

1565
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:04,300
You made the mistake once!

1566
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,800
Don't make the mistake again!

1567
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:09,940
Okay.

1568
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,320
You should be fine now.

1569
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,020
There we go.

1570
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,140
Wait, I don't ask.

1571
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:22,840
I don't ask too.

1572
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,620
She gonna open the door for me?

1573
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:26,540
Whoa!

1574
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,160
I thought she was gonna...

1575
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,500
I was like, oh, she's gonna open the door for me, right?

1576
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:37,340
I...

1577
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:38,300
Okay!

1578
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,840
I assumed that the door was gonna open.

1579
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,580
She was gonna do something and the door would just open.

1580
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,880
Which way is it?

1581
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,740
Oh, this part takes up so many frames.

1582
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:51,340
Oh, this part takes up so many frames.

1583
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:52,640
It's like, Jackie, open the door!

1584
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:56,300
There's a crank?

1585
01:04:58,840 --> 01:04:59,800
Okay, I got this.

1586
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:00,720
I figured it out.

1587
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:03,620
Yeah, I was gonna be like, can you open this door for me?

1588
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:07,120
So we can keep doing this, like, little cat and mouse chase?

1589
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:09,140
That you're trying to choose...

1590
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:09,480
I don't know.

1591
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:11,020
I just thought it was a way of flirting.

1592
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,480
The fuck is this crank that I missed?

1593
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:18,780
Alright.

1594
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:24,040
Jackie, I didn't consent to our birthday, huh?

1595
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,900
Cause it's not my birthday yet!

1596
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,860
And where the fuck is this crank?

1597
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:33,900
Oh, there it is!

1598
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:35,660
Oh, there it is!

1599
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:36,380
Okay, I found it.

1600
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:42,080
It's only me for thinking that she would be nice enough to open the door for me.

1601
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:44,640
You know?

1602
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,440
Doesn't she wanna keep playing tag?

1603
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,040
Okay, there's no missing cranks this time.

1604
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,180
Oh!

1605
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:56,720
Okay.

1606
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,070
Wait, I can't...

1607
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:00,680
Oh my god!

1608
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:01,160
Oh my god!

1609
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,880
I jumped!

1610
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:08,760
My thighs are too thick to jump, apparently!

1611
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:09,960
And it's...

1612
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,780
It's made of sticks!

1613
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,280
Why can't I jump?!

1614
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:28,900
Okay.

1615
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,080
Look, she was saying happy birthday.

1616
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:37,880
I had to let her say happy birthday.

1617
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,340
Okay, now I see the crank.

1618
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:42,720
There we go.

1619
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:43,920
Yeah, that's Becky right!

1620
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:44,360
Ah!

1621
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,600
I thought she was dead!

1622
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,700
I thought she was dead!

1623
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:53,520
I thought she was dead!

1624
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,100
How could she still kill me?!

1625
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,000
It's just a head!

1626
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,060
It's just...

1627
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:01,020
Okay.

1628
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:01,900
Anyway.

1629
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,060
Yeah, that's Becky right!

1630
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,180
Can't do shit now!

1631
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:06,340
No!

1632
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,140
Oh gosh, it's start cranking.

1633
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,380
I need to stop gloating and start cranking!

1634
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,160
She's always watching!

1635
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,480
I thought she was gonna...

1636
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,380
It was just the head!

1637
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,980
How was she able to grab me?!

1638
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:27,060
Okay.

1639
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:29,060
Thank you!

1640
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:30,400
Thank you for the super chat!

1641
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,900
Thank you!

1642
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:31,560
Thank you!

1643
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,460
Alright, here we go!

1644
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:39,280
I might have celebrated too soon, guys!

1645
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:41,660
Oh, hello?

1646
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:42,980
What the fuck?!

1647
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:48,440
Okay.

1648
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:52,760
Yay!

1649
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,760
I got an achievement for killing Jackie!

1650
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:57,880
Oh!

1651
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:00,440
It was all just a scary dream!

1652
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,080
Please respond!

1653
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:02,520
Over!

1654
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:03,880
Hey, there's like...

1655
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,820
Crazy murder bots going around!

1656
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:07,600
Hello?

1657
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:10,300
Oh!

1658
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:14,260
Glad to see you made it here without any complications whatsoever!

1659
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:14,840
Oh!

1660
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:20,980
So we did some digging to learn more about that bothersome endoskeleton that keeps relentlessly pursuing you!

1661
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:21,420
I don't think they're...

1662
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:26,540
From what we can tell, it was designed to keep Murray's son entertained while Murray worked.

1663
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,700
It would mimic the actions of those around it.

1664
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,360
At some point...

1665
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,080
The mimic!

1666
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:33,800
Title drop!

1667
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:36,380
The details of which are a little fuzzy.

1668
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:40,900
This mimic endoskeleton then copied that violent behavior.

1669
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:43,900
Oh, he was a special boy!

1670
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:44,880
We came up with some great ideas on how you protect yourself.

1671
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:50,000
Unfortunately, we came up with some great ideas on how to protect yourself.

1672
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,740
What happened to him?

1673
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:58,080
So, it seems that maybe distraction and avoidance are your best tools.

1674
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,080
As a direct confrontation...

1675
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:00,560
Can I have a gun?

1676
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,420
You like that!

1677
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,240
I like that.

1678
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,280
Oh...

1679
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:11,760
...and I'm sure they would tell you that themselves, if they hadn't died from blood loss.

1680
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,660
We expect you'll succeed where they failed.

1681
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:19,100
One out of three Fazbear employees has confidence in you, so go get them, Tiger.

1682
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:20,860
Wait, I don't like the size.

1683
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:23,220
I found the location of another upgrade station in the showrooms.

1684
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,960
You can get there if you head back through the welcome show.

1685
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,200
That's the room where you entered the building.

1686
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,620
Wait, one out of three?

1687
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:31,740
Check the monitor.

1688
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:32,960
I'm sending you a camera feed.

1689
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:33,980
Go there.

1690
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:35,360
Oh.

1691
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:36,140
Over and out.

1692
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:38,540
I feel like...

1693
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,900
Can you send me a gun?

1694
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,680
I like a shotgun, please.

1695
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:46,200
All right.

1696
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:47,440
Maps.

1697
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:51,100
Wait, how is he sending me a camera feed?

1698
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,500
Like, where is the camera feed?

1699
01:09:58,810 --> 01:09:59,910
It's in here?

1700
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:03,810
No.

1701
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:07,930
What the fuck is the TV?

1702
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:08,830
Oh!

1703
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:10,430
Okay.

1704
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:11,690
That's...

1705
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:12,750
Sorry.

1706
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:15,690
Two, six.

1707
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:18,470
Is that the password?

1708
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:22,110
The one angle I didn't look at.

1709
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:23,450
Two, six, two.

1710
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:27,970
All right, gamers don't look up, guys.

1711
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:30,830
Two, six, two, nine.

1712
01:10:34,150 --> 01:10:35,770
Two, six, two, nine.

1713
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:38,030
Four.

1714
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:40,570
Two, six, two, nine, four.

1715
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:44,150
That it?

1716
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:46,010
Two, six, two, nine, four?

1717
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:47,390
Wait, what is that?

1718
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:49,750
Oh, that's where I have to go.

1719
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,210
Two, six, two, nine, four.

1720
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:55,370
Okay.

1721
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:55,990
Yeah.

1722
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:56,910
Who's...

1723
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:57,730
All right, remember that.

1724
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:59,770
Two, six, two, nine, four, guys.

1725
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:02,810
I'm gonna make sure it's correct.

1726
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:03,770
Two, six.

1727
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:05,190
I'm too lazy for that.

1728
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:06,410
I trust you guys.

1729
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:11,010
I think the elephant's gone.

1730
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:12,910
Right?

1731
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:18,530
He's not gone, is he?

1732
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:21,090
He's always here watching me.

1733
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:23,670
Oh, he's here.

1734
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:25,870
I can hear him.

1735
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:28,190
He's never gone.

1736
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:30,910
That's the secret.

1737
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:34,510
He's always here watching me.

1738
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:35,310
Good job.

1739
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:37,190
You can reach the lobby from here.

1740
01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:37,850
Where?

1741
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:43,490
The lobby doors have been locked by some showtime run mirrors, whatever that means.

1742
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:46,390
Look for a control station.

1743
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:50,690
You should be able to get those doors to open by restarting the welcome show program.

1744
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:52,650
What the fuck is that?

1745
01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:55,830
Here?

1746
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:57,110
Oh, it must be here.

1747
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:00,890
There's a lever.

1748
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:01,650
There's a way.

1749
01:12:03,370 --> 01:12:03,830
Hello?

1750
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:03,930
Hello?

1751
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:06,730
Oh, that's an upgrade.

1752
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,420
Welcome show update.

1753
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,820
We need to update the swing B.

1754
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:18,760
He's shorting out.

1755
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:19,980
Oh, we should reset it.

1756
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:22,200
Alright, let's reset everything.

1757
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:25,720
So we can access the show tab.

1758
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,280
Do I have this?

1759
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,220
I do.

1760
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:31,840
It's over here.

1761
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,360
What do I do here?

1762
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:44,640
What the fuck?

1763
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,440
What does this do?

1764
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:50,140
What?

1765
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:54,290
Who said that?

1766
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:57,470
Is that the one...

1767
01:12:57,470 --> 01:13:01,390
The millions of children that died at Five Nights at Murray's?

1768
01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:04,970
Who said that?

1769
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:08,930
Oh, at the crouch?

1770
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:12,790
Wait, is that the...

1771
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:14,290
Is that the mimic?

1772
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:17,070
Oh yeah, because he mimics the child.

1773
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:19,390
Oh, there is a place.

1774
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:23,820
Who's crying?

1775
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:29,900
Hello?

1776
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:32,620
Are you in here?

1777
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:36,680
There's a child crying.

1778
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:38,640
In my game.

1779
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,160
I don't like that.

1780
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:43,920
Oh.

1781
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:48,220
I'll go back.

1782
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:55,700
Whenever there's a child crying, that's never a good thing.

1783
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,520
I'll head back downstairs.

1784
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:03,520
Hello?

1785
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:10,520
Alright.

1786
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:15,020
I feel like I just might have missed something.

1787
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,520
What's up with the crying child?

1788
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:28,310
Oh.

1789
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:33,820
Oh.

1790
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:38,900
Oh.

1791
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,300
It's hiding time.

1792
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,100
It's time to play Alien Isolation.

1793
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:59,150
I'll bust in nowhere.

1794
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,300
Okay.

1795
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,300
Oh, it's hide and seek.

1796
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:15,720
Oh, one of these.

1797
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,100
Oh.

1798
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:32,020
They

1799
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:38,790
just all go la la la.

1800
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:52,490
I don't like this.

1801
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:56,310
I don't like this, Harry.

1802
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:57,830
Hello, emergency.

1803
01:15:58,110 --> 01:15:59,930
This is a big emergency.

1804
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:00,910
Oh, hey!

1805
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:04,210
What was the password again, guys?

1806
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:06,270
I already forgot.

1807
01:16:06,710 --> 01:16:06,950
Two.

1808
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:09,050
Two.

1809
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:11,530
Six.

1810
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:12,890
Two.

1811
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:14,230
Nine.

1812
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:16,330
Oh, that's not the right area.

1813
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:21,290
I hate this area.

1814
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:25,250
Do I have this?

1815
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:27,050
I do.

1816
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:28,450
I don't.

1817
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:34,780
I'm not ready.

1818
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:36,620
I'm not.

1819
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,900
I don't want to play hide-and-seek.

1820
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,660
I'm tired of this, Grandpa.

1821
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,000
Where the fuck do I go?

1822
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,260
That's too bad.

1823
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:10,160
Where the fuck do I go?

1824
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:19,040
There's a door that I need to go?

1825
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,440
Oh, is it that door?

1826
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:21,900
Oh, it's that door.

1827
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:23,800
Found the door.

1828
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:27,360
Found it.

1829
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:34,740
What's this?

1830
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,540
That's a safe door.

1831
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:41,480
Okay, nothing in here.

1832
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:43,900
Hello?

1833
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,440
Oh, it's safe.

1834
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,640
That means I'm in a safe area.

1835
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:54,260
Uh...

1836
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:55,900
Where am I?

1837
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:57,880
I'm in the welcome lobby.

1838
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,000
There's nothing new.

1839
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:03,520
Oh.

1840
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:05,580
What's this?

1841
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,100
Can you help me, Mr. Help... Mrs. Helpful?

1842
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:08,560
Error.

1843
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:11,600
This elevator is out of service.

1844
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:12,640
Which one?

1845
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:13,120
This one?

1846
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:13,740
Thank you for your patience.

1847
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:13,780
Thanks.

1848
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,080
Oh, that was very helpful, Mrs. Helpful.

1849
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:23,800
Enjoy a short ride on this reliably safe elevator to access the MCM showrooms.

1850
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,400
That it?

1851
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,120
Oh, that wasn't very helpful at all, Mrs. Helpful.

1852
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:35,520
Did she make that noise?

1853
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:47,980
Alright, what's...

1854
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:48,700
What's in here?

1855
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,800
Let me...

1856
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:56,500
Oh, my God.

1857
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:57,000
Please!

1858
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,140
Why am I not strong enough?

1859
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,580
My noodle arms.

1860
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:13,740
My noodle arms are just...

1861
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:16,120
It's so noodle-y.

1862
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,540
Oh, yeah, there's a little guy here.

1863
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:23,060
I know, it's hard.

1864
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:24,960
Hello?

1865
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:26,600
Hi.

1866
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:28,560
I'm Paul.

1867
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:33,490
What are you doing?

1868
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:34,170
Is he cleaning?

1869
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:36,430
Oh, he's like a little clean bot.

1870
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:40,610
I need to train more.

1871
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:43,510
Holy shit.

1872
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:45,950
Okay, let me lower the graphics for this.

1873
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:46,390
Jesus.

1874
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:47,310
I'm a...

1875
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:48,870
Guys, I'm a 40-80.

1876
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:51,030
Like, I don't understand.

1877
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:53,010
Oh, my God.

1878
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:57,170
How much more do I have to lower the graphics?

1879
01:20:01,890 --> 01:20:04,630
Yeah, I need a training montage.

1880
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:06,450
Okay, what do I lower?

1881
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:07,990
Guys, we gotta pick our poison.

1882
01:20:10,490 --> 01:20:11,850
The 49...

1883
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:12,450
Guys, you're right.

1884
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:16,430
I should get a 50-80 to play the new FNAF game.

1885
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:20,210
Shadows?

1886
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:20,830
You're right.

1887
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:22,050
We don't need shadows.

1888
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:27,930
I can pet him?

1889
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:29,790
Can I?

1890
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:31,470
Do I pet him?

1891
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:34,370
Oh, I can!

1892
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:36,470
Oh, who's a good boy?

1893
01:20:37,150 --> 01:20:38,130
You are.

1894
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:39,690
You are.

1895
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:40,590
You are.

1896
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:42,210
All right.

1897
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:47,750
If I want to get rid of this...

1898
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:50,170
Ah!

1899
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:51,510
Never mind, give up.

1900
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:52,530
Fuck this.

1901
01:20:53,870 --> 01:20:55,550
Let this elevator be broken.

1902
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:01,500
Wait, no, I do have to fix it.

1903
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,280
No, I have to fix it.

1904
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:08,040
Press this button.

1905
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,360
No, this doesn't let me press anything.

1906
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:17,480
Miss Helper, I need help.

1907
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:19,620
Oh!

1908
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:20,620
I can upgrade.

1909
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,600
This elevator is out of service.

1910
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:24,320
Okay, I need more help than that.

1911
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:25,060
Thank you for your patience.

1912
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:26,840
Wait, what is this Miss Helper?

1913
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,200
Security...

1914
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,860
You help me now?

1915
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:37,060
Security personnel, please help with client relations until the elevator remains...

1916
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:37,100
All right.

1917
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:38,520
I am security.

1918
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:41,180
Attention.

1919
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,960
Elevator maintenance is required.

1920
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:47,480
Referred to the repair cassette for instructions.

1921
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:48,740
But where's the repair cassette?

1922
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:53,920
The repair cassette is conveniently located on the second floor balcony.

1923
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,200
All right, that's convenient.

1924
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,840
Please enter the following code to retrieve the repair cassette.

1925
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,680
Zero, one, five, eight.

1926
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:05,100
Zero, one, five, eight.

1927
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:05,460
Okay.

1928
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:07,240
All right.

1929
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:08,840
Zero, one, five, eight.

1930
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:11,540
Still cleaning.

1931
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:12,820
All right.

1932
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:13,640
This is where I die.

1933
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:24,400
Oh.

1934
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,120
Okay.

1935
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:31,320
Zero, one, five.

1936
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:44,260
True.

1937
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:45,660
Oh my god.

1938
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:46,600
He's so fast.

1939
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:47,780
Ha ha ha.

1940
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:49,420
Stupid.

1941
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:52,280
That's right.

1942
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,000
Where did I go?

1943
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:58,060
No object permanence for you.

1944
01:22:58,740 --> 01:22:59,800
Ha ha ha ha.

1945
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:03,080
He doesn't know I'm in the locket.

1946
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:04,480
Ha ha ha.

1947
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,000
Fast but stupid.

1948
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,120
That's right, dumb dog.

1949
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:12,700
All right.

1950
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:13,280
Let's just wait.

1951
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:18,020
He doesn't have object permanence.

1952
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:18,580
That's right.

1953
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:19,540
His one weakness.

1954
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:21,980
You think he's up the stairs now?

1955
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:27,600
Is that upstairs?

1956
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:28,740
That's upstairs, right?

1957
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:29,060
Yeah.

1958
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,260
What the fuck?

1959
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:33,910
Oh, wait.

1960
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:35,550
It takes him forever to go up the stairs.

1961
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:36,050
Oh.

1962
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:36,970
Ha ha ha.

1963
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:38,230
He's like, wait.

1964
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:38,810
Where did he go?

1965
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:39,930
Ha ha ha.

1966
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:41,330
All right.

1967
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:42,970
I need him to go up the stairs again.

1968
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:47,430
I like how he's like, scurries downstairs.

1969
01:23:48,050 --> 01:23:48,430
Ha ha ha.

1970
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:48,990
I like it.

1971
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:51,050
Ha ha ha.

1972
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:52,730
He is wandering.

1973
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,310
Guys, I'm not gonna...

1974
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:59,450
This dog is un-pet-able, guys.

1975
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:01,950
If I pet him, he's gonna fucking bite my head off.

1976
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:03,750
All right.

1977
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:05,170
Open sesame.

1978
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:11,380
Okay, there you go.

1979
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,660
Now where do I put this?

1980
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:15,000
Where do I put a tape?

1981
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,220
Where do you put the tape?

1982
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,680
I have the tape.

1983
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:25,120
Attention.

1984
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:27,920
Elevator maintenance is required.

1985
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:31,400
Refer to the repair cassette for instructions.

1986
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:32,180
Machine?

1987
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:33,240
Which machine?

1988
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:36,360
The repair cassette is conveniently located...

1989
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,060
Is it this?

1990
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:41,200
Oh, oh, that's a cassette player?

1991
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:44,420
Oh, I thought it was like a gotcha machine.

1992
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:45,200
Wait.

1993
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:46,080
Ha ha ha.

1994
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:48,580
Okay, it looked like a gotcha.

1995
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,560
And grab the side walls until repairs are finished.

1996
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:56,680
Please follow these simple instructions to reset the elevator.

1997
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:02,040
First, open the repairmatic box.

1998
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:04,660
Oh, it may already be open.

1999
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,120
But if it isn't, then do that.

2000
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:08,240
Let's go gathering.

2001
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:11,420
Next, turn the power off.

2002
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:12,820
Okay.

2003
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:19,240
Once the elevator is off, remove any obstructions from the exposed machinery.

2004
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:20,240
Oh!

2005
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:23,720
It would also be a good time to ask the passenger...

2006
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,060
Oh!

2007
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:25,160
Oh my god, thank god.

2008
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,740
My noodle dimes, I did it.

2009
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:30,760
Rotate the hand crank clockwise to raise the elevator.

2010
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:31,980
What do I...

2011
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,680
What do I get this guy out of...

2012
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:35,940
Oh, maybe I'll put him in the storage.

2013
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:38,180
Wait, what?

2014
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:42,360
Instructions unclear.

2015
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,480
What do I do with this?

2016
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:44,340
I...

2017
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:46,520
I can't.

2018
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:47,680
What do I...

2019
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:51,040
How do I...

2020
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,040
Oh, okay, I dropped it.

2021
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:53,360
Oh, oh, right click is dropped.

2022
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,300
I was like, am I gonna hold this forever?

2023
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,040
Okay.

2024
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:04,480
Open it.

2025
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,240
She'll see.

2026
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:09,920
Oh, there's a note here.

2027
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:14,740
If the elevator is out of alignment, adjust the thing that balances it.

2028
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:16,120
That's what it says.

2029
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:17,080
Is there an alignment?

2030
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:17,920
There's a line.

2031
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:18,800
Hold up.

2032
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,100
I almost forgot.

2033
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,140
Make sure...

2034
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:21,960
Oh, I knew it.

2035
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:23,360
I knew it.

2036
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:24,680
I knew it.

2037
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:29,860
Where the fuck is the emergency...

2038
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:33,100
Oh, emergency brake.

2039
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:33,700
Here it is.

2040
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:35,600
Yeah.

2041
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:40,700
To re-align the elevator, use the sliders to re-balance the load-weight alignment.

2042
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:42,100
Doohickey.

2043
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:52,560
And please, bear in mind, if anything does go wrong, we want you to know that it's not your fault.

2044
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:57,500
It's another one of life's speed bumps.

2045
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:59,680
I'll be dead.

2046
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:00,400
I'll be dead.

2047
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:00,700
I'll be dead.

2048
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:00,940
I'll be dead.

2049
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:03,180
Being dead is not a speed bump.

2050
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:03,600
Great.

2051
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:09,740
Now that I assume you are done with the alignment, use the diagnosis and repair function.

2052
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:13,660
Input the following code using the buttons.

2053
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:22,540
One, two, three...

2054
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,540
I saw...

2055
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:37,640
I was like, wait, what?

2056
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:41,740
You are now safe to get under the elevator.

2057
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:42,780
What?

2058
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:45,120
Oh, there's an...

2059
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,040
To realign the elevator.

2060
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:47,960
What the buttons are?

2061
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:48,440
Oh!

2062
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:52,200
I didn't look down!

2063
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:53,680
I...

2064
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:56,940
Gators don't look down as well.

2065
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:02,800
If anything does go wrong, we want you to know that it's, it's not your fault.

2066
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:06,760
Okay, I got so confused.

2067
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:10,740
I was like, where the button is these?

2068
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:13,480
Okay.

2069
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:15,440
Four...

2070
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:17,560
Great.

2071
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:22,380
Now that I assume you are done with the alignment, use the diagnosis...

2072
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,920
She said it wasn't my fault, guys!

2073
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,640
Then put the following code using the buttons.

2074
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,100
One...

2075
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:31,040
Oh, it's different.

2076
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:32,380
Four...

2077
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:34,460
Two...

2078
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:35,040
One...

2079
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:36,310
Three...

2080
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:39,640
Four...

2081
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:42,940
Two...

2082
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:44,980
Wait, what was the last one I didn't press?

2083
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:45,780
Three.

2084
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:47,160
There we go.

2085
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:52,060
Now, disengage the emergency brake and back out carefully.

2086
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:52,540
Alright.

2087
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,170
This is different, cause...

2088
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:55,760
The first one was four.

2089
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,340
Alright.

2090
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:03,620
Got you.

2091
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:10,420
Turn on the power, and you are done.

2092
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:11,080
Yay!

2093
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:12,960
I did it!

2094
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,200
I'm so smart!

2095
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:17,000
I feel so smart!

2096
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:18,300
First try!

2097
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:21,280
Alright, this way.

2098
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:23,100
I did it, guys!

2099
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:26,940
No death so far, everyone.

2100
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:29,940
Not a singular death.

2101
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:34,260
Eh?

2102
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:36,960
There can't be any monsters here.

2103
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,160
I can't even run.

2104
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,720
I can enjoy my surroundings.

2105
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:43,340
What's down here?

2106
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,080
Oh.

2107
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:47,460
Hello?

2108
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,000
Oh, that's where the clean bot is.

2109
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:52,380
Oh, I can crank.

2110
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:53,900
Oh, and another collectible!

2111
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:57,060
Yay!

2112
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:58,360
What's that?

2113
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,080
Chica's party world!

2114
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:01,480
Oh my god, I can sell this on eBay.

2115
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:03,680
Oh wait.

2116
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:05,480
I gotta check if I get mail.

2117
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:06,740
Any mail?

2118
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:12,250
Oh.

2119
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:13,150
Oh.

2120
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:13,210
Oh.

2121
01:30:13,210 --> 01:30:14,450
So, no friends, I guess.

2122
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:20,790
Okay.

2123
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:22,970
Grab this.

2124
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:26,130
So I can...

2125
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:28,790
So I can store my collectible.

2126
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:30,890
Oh!

2127
01:30:31,490 --> 01:30:33,050
Gotta make sure that's safe.

2128
01:30:35,950 --> 01:30:37,390
And then...

2129
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:38,910
Grab my letter...

2130
01:30:38,910 --> 01:30:39,110
Oh.

2131
01:30:39,370 --> 01:30:39,630
Wait.

2132
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:39,930
What?

2133
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:43,650
Oh, is this for collectible?

2134
01:30:44,270 --> 01:30:45,890
Oh, I wasn't even supposed to be here.

2135
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:46,530
Oh.

2136
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:48,590
That was just for the collectible.

2137
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:48,930
Alright.

2138
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:49,910
I guess I go back up.

2139
01:30:52,330 --> 01:30:52,770
Wait.

2140
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:53,570
Actually...

2141
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:54,690
I want...

2142
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:55,810
Sure, I don't...

2143
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:57,610
Maybe I downloaded mail here.

2144
01:30:59,370 --> 01:30:59,950
Wait, no.

2145
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:00,570
That's the map.

2146
01:31:01,650 --> 01:31:03,370
I hope this message reaches someone.

2147
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:04,590
There's something outside.

2148
01:31:04,930 --> 01:31:06,710
I have no idea what it wants.

2149
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:08,990
I can still hear Thompson's screams.

2150
01:31:09,490 --> 01:31:11,230
I can't sign up for this.

2151
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:13,450
Oh, I fixed the elevator.

2152
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:13,970
You're right.

2153
01:31:15,910 --> 01:31:16,870
Oh, outside.

2154
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:20,610
I fixed the elevator outside.

2155
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:27,300
Oh, he's gone.

2156
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:29,080
Yes.

2157
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:30,860
He's not gone.

2158
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:31,680
He's not...

2159
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:33,680
I saw the elephant.

2160
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:34,860
I was like...

2161
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:35,720
Oh, he's not gone.

2162
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,140
No shaking in the elevator.

2163
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:42,100
Oh, hey.

2164
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:43,520
Another one of you.

2165
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:45,000
Hello there.

2166
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,960
Hey.

2167
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,100
Who's a good robot.

2168
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:48,720
You are.

2169
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:49,820
That's right.

2170
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,300
You are made clean.

2171
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:55,480
Alright.

2172
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:56,620
This is less scary.

2173
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:01,800
It's just a hallway.

2174
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:04,580
There's Carter Caterpillar.

2175
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:05,700
There.

2176
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:06,020
And on.

2177
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:07,460
There's suits of armor.

2178
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,260
Surely they won't come alive to fucking kill me.

2179
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:13,040
Oh, there's another one of you guys.

2180
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:15,240
Hello there.

2181
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:19,880
If I treat you all well, you won't turn evil and try to kill me.

2182
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:20,760
Come on.

2183
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:22,700
Who wants a little pet?

2184
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:23,920
That's right.

2185
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:26,400
That's right.

2186
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:27,440
Alright.

2187
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:29,660
Let's see what she says for regular people.

2188
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:30,980
Oh, Mr. Helpa.

2189
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:32,180
Welcome to the furry showrooms.

2190
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,000
Everything's for sale or lease.

2191
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:37,340
Please inquire within for availability and delivery options.

2192
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:45,460
We're said to announce that the storytime showroom is currently closed, pending mitigation of insurance claims.

2193
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:46,820
Oh, there they.

2194
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:53,800
I bet they were- I bet they were trying to- Trying to feast us for more money.

2195
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,820
Rooftop access permissions have been changed to accommodate our creative team.

2196
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,740
So they can retard the roof.

2197
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:08,860
If you require rooftop access, upgrade your permissions at the security office located on the second floor of the big top showroom.

2198
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,100
That's right.

2199
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,500
But I am security, Mr. Helpful.

2200
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:15,400
You should be aware of potential power spikes.

2201
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:21,480
In case of an outage, use the conduit in the big top showroom entrance to reset the system.

2202
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:23,520
I don't like these.

2203
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,320
I don't- Oh, I don't like that.

2204
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:26,080
They're just there.

2205
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:27,720
I like it.

2206
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,540
They're just standing there, menacingly.

2207
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,000
It's in here.

2208
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:36,480
This is my- Oh, this is a safe room.

2209
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:37,060
Nice.

2210
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,620
Oh, hey, there's someone- Okay, four?

2211
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,880
I remember this, guys.

2212
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:43,160
Four.

2213
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:46,800
It's just four?

2214
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:49,440
Is that it?

2215
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:50,300
Seven.

2216
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:52,860
Four, seven.

2217
01:33:57,810 --> 01:33:58,350
What?

2218
01:34:00,290 --> 01:34:01,650
Four, seven, eight.

2219
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,160
God, it's so slow.

2220
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:07,660
Two.

2221
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:08,920
Four, seven, eight, two.

2222
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:13,880
Oh, four, seven, eight, two.

2223
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,660
Cyclone, thank you for the super chat.

2224
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:16,480
Thank you, thank you.

2225
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:16,740
Thank you.

2226
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:18,920
So happy that those robots got met by Doki.

2227
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:19,720
Thank you for the super chat.

2228
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:20,460
Thank you, thank you.

2229
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:21,280
Absol!

2230
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:22,520
Thank you for the super chat.

2231
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:23,440
Thank you, thank you.

2232
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:28,860
He thought this would be a horror game, but it's actually an elevator maintenance simulator.

2233
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:30,940
Thank you for the super chat.

2234
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:31,900
Thank you, thank you.

2235
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:33,600
Here we go.

2236
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,180
Doing my job.

2237
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:36,820
Fixing elevators.

2238
01:34:37,620 --> 01:34:39,040
Oh, that's Mr. Moon!

2239
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,560
Hey, does Mr. Moon exist, too?

2240
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:44,660
Can I borrow your voice for a project?

2241
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:45,920
Oh, what for?

2242
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:47,600
I don't even know you.

2243
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:49,220
I'm brand new here.

2244
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:50,920
Let's start again.

2245
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,340
I'm Fiona, and you are?

2246
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:53,800
Edwin.

2247
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:54,800
Edwin Murray.

2248
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:56,480
This is my dad's place.

2249
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:57,520
Oh, it's him!

2250
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:00,220
It's the owner.

2251
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:02,960
It's Walt Disney.

2252
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:23,200
Oh, he's the one that made the mimic!

2253
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:29,500
Oh, so the mimic's gonna have the girl's voice.

2254
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:30,460
That's incredible!

2255
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:32,120
What do you call it?

2256
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:35,080
Oh, um... I don't know.

2257
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:37,600
I... I haven't thought of a name yet.

2258
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,280
Well, how would you describe it in one word?

2259
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:43,100
I guess I would have to say... Helpful.

2260
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:43,800
Yeah.

2261
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:45,300
At its core, it is helpful.

2262
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:46,380
That's a great name.

2263
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:48,380
And I would be delighted to help.

2264
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:50,680
What kind of voice should I do?

2265
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:53,580
Oh.

2266
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:55,620
What's the voice?

2267
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:59,120
I'll never know what voice she did!

2268
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,520
Okay, as soon as I heard that here, like...

2269
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:08,000
As soon as I hear the female voice, I'll be like, It's the mimic.

2270
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:09,040
It's her.

2271
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,040
It's the showroom.

2272
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,700
Oh, is that... Okay.

2273
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:17,880
That should grab me access.

2274
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:24,120
Oh.

2275
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:27,760
This is helpful?

2276
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:32,780
There's something inside this box.

2277
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:38,220
Wait, do you guys hear that?

2278
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:39,520
It's like breathing.

2279
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:47,150
Something breathing in here.

2280
01:36:59,290 --> 01:36:59,930
I...

2281
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:00,630
I...

2282
01:37:00,630 --> 01:37:00,910
I don't...

2283
01:37:00,910 --> 01:37:02,410
I know you're in here!

2284
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:04,290
I can hear you breathe!

2285
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:06,010
It's not like you're...

2286
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:06,690
Oh my god.

2287
01:37:06,970 --> 01:37:07,330
I...

2288
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:12,610
Happy birthday...

2289
01:37:12,610 --> 01:37:13,190
To...

2290
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:13,830
You...

2291
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:16,110
It's...

2292
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:19,290
It's the fucking...

2293
01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:20,670
Marilyn...

2294
01:37:20,670 --> 01:37:22,490
Marilyn Monroe in me.

2295
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:31,280
I swear to god.

2296
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:33,180
I hear the voices!

2297
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:35,580
Oh.

2298
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:42,690
There's a little hole now.

2299
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:50,780
Happy birthday...

2300
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:52,240
Mr. President.

2301
01:37:58,480 --> 01:37:59,360
Wait, is that me?

2302
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:02,220
Am I breathing?

2303
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,960
Do I just not do cardio?

2304
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:07,560
Oh, it's me, isn't it?

2305
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:09,100
It was me this entire time.

2306
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:10,740
Oh my god.

2307
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:14,480
I just walked like five steps and I didn't do enough cardio.

2308
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:17,160
La la la la.

2309
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:18,080
La la la.

2310
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:19,400
La la la.

2311
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,220
La la la.

2312
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:21,300
La la la.

2313
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:22,340
La la la.

2314
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:22,560
La la la.

2315
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:22,760
La la la la.

2316
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:23,720
AHHHHH!

2317
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:35,220
Maybe he won't turn around.

2318
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:48,090
Zajan, thank you for the super chat again.

2319
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:52,730
You mean I missed that code!

2320
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:55,250
Oh, there's a TV over there.

2321
01:38:58,210 --> 01:39:00,910
Guys, I don't have time to watch the TV.

2322
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:09,320
Okay, he'll turn around.

2323
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:20,120
Who do do do do?

Who do do do?

2326
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:25,800
I can wait.

2327
01:39:29,490 --> 01:39:31,970
Guys, I don't have time to watch the T.V.

2328
01:39:32,390 --> 01:39:34,790
There's a guy fucking trying to kill me.

2329
01:39:35,050 --> 01:39:38,230
He he he he he he.

2330
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:45,580
It's too late.

2331
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:46,740
I gotta be a streamer now.

2332
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:48,620
I gotta do at chat.

2333
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:53,760
What's that over there?

2334
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:56,020
Is there something over there?

2335
01:40:03,130 --> 01:40:04,750
Oh my god, guys, at chat!

2336
01:40:05,330 --> 01:40:06,310
Wait, what's over here?

2337
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:13,160
Wait, what's over here?

2338
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:17,180
Oh, I could go back.

2339
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:24,840
At chat, what's the code?

2340
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:30,100
The breathing is...

2341
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:31,720
Alright.

2342
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:34,720
Guys, I trust you.

2343
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:35,600
At chat!

2346
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:59,520
3... 5... 1... 1... Oh my god.

2347
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,860
Okay, it's 4 digits.

2348
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:07,180
3... 4... 6... 9... Oh my god.

0... 4... 5... What?

2354
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,560
One of these has to be correct.

2355
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:44,560
8... 6... 7... 9... Jesus!

2356
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:45,480
I'm skipping this.

2357
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:46,340
It's a collectible.

2358
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:48,480
That's right.

2359
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,080
No collectible for you guys.

2360
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:56,290
You think I care enough?

2361
01:41:57,530 --> 01:42:00,270
It's a 3... 0... 0... 0...

2362
01:42:00,270 --> 01:42:00,270
1.

2363

I know it isn't 3... 0... 0... 1.

2369
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:09,830
Cause it is 3... 0... 0...

2370
01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:09,830
1.

2371
01:42:10,010 --> 01:42:12,370
People in chat would say it's 3... 0... 0... 1.

2372
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:13,430
I did not see anyone else.

2373
01:42:13,650 --> 01:42:14,010

0 I knew it.

2470
01:42:50,910 --> 01:42:53,250
All you achievement hunters, I got you.

2471
01:42:53,330 --> 01:42:54,870
I know what you think.

2472
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:56,330
I know how you think.

2473
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:58,610
You know you wanted me to get that collectible.

2474
01:42:58,890 --> 01:43:03,370
You're like, no, Doki, I can't sleep if I can't see you get that collectible.

2475
01:43:03,630 --> 01:43:07,410
I read your fucking mind and then I turn on this lever.

2476
01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:11,250
I don't know what it does, but I turn on any lever I see.

2477
01:43:16,230 --> 01:43:16,830
Alright.

2478
01:43:16,830 --> 01:43:18,630
I know what you are.

2479
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:23,730
I have no idea what that did.

2480
01:43:24,170 --> 01:43:25,010
It did something.

2481
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:33,930
I know you can't live without me getting that collectible.

2482
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:39,900
Alright, here we go.

2483
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:43,420
Now I'm back here.

2484
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:53,160
Hello, everybody.

2485
01:43:53,740 --> 01:43:55,600
Oh, I'm back to another safe zone.

2486
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:56,220
Yes.

2487
01:43:59,830 --> 01:44:01,430
What did that music play?

2488
01:44:03,130 --> 01:44:03,810
Hello?

2489
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:08,840
Oh, I'm back, yeah.

2490
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:10,740
Oh.

2491
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:14,920
Okay, I feel like there might be something here.

2492
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:19,320
Hello?

2493
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:20,860
Hello?

2494
01:44:20,860 --> 01:44:26,790
Wait, I can use the... Wait, what?

2495
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:30,750
What do I do here?

2496
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:38,000
Okay, that's where...

2497
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,460
Can I go downstairs?

2498
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:41,700
Can I use this elevator?

2499
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:43,500
Oh, I can.

2500
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,320
Oh, the male guy.

2501
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:48,720
Forgot about him.

2502
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:53,200
Is he still back here?

2503
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:54,720
Wait, you're back here?

2504
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:56,000
How did you get back here?

2505
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:58,320
Hello?

2506
01:45:02,710 --> 01:45:03,190
Oh.

2507
01:45:04,770 --> 01:45:06,490
Why won't you let me through the door?

2508
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:12,030
Are you okay?

2509
01:45:13,470 --> 01:45:14,790
I was gonna say he's alive.

2510
01:45:15,330 --> 01:45:15,850
Execute.

2511
01:45:17,490 --> 01:45:18,010
Execute.

2512
01:45:18,010 --> 01:45:20,030
Do you need a snappy delivery?

2513
01:45:20,470 --> 01:45:21,950
Wait, why can't that go through?

2514
01:45:22,350 --> 01:45:23,950
I deliver in a snap.

2515
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:30,010
That can't be, right?

2516
01:45:30,350 --> 01:45:31,730
Quick and snap, snap, snappy.

2517
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:35,780
Do you need a snappy delivery?

2518
01:45:36,340 --> 01:45:38,420
Yeah, there's an invisible box here.

2519
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:39,340
Mail call.

2520
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:42,620
Oh, the game bugged?

2521
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:46,580
I was like, why... I was like, why is there an invisible wall?

2522
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:52,020
It's like, who the fuck is blocking me?

2523
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:53,440
The force of God?

2524
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,640
Oh, he's supposed to be dead?

2525
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:01,900
He came back to life.

2526
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:03,660
Not in Doki's game.

2527
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:06,420
You can never kill the mailman.

2528
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:08,180
What if I just do this?

2529
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:09,560
Do you need a snappy delivery?

2530
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:10,920
Does it break the game even more?

2531
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:19,740
Yeah, I was gonna say!

2532
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,260
I didn't even come back!

2533
01:46:27,010 --> 01:46:28,370
It's ghost robot.

2534
01:46:28,910 --> 01:46:29,950
It's like the ghost shit.

2535
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:33,930
Can I just go back down then?

2536
01:46:36,650 --> 01:46:39,010
Oh, do not deuce the elevator?

2537
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:41,130
I can't...

2538
01:46:41,130 --> 01:46:42,770
I can't go into the hole!

2539
01:46:44,730 --> 01:46:46,050
Hey, what do I do?

2540
01:46:55,330 --> 01:46:56,750
Oh, Jackie's room.

2541
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:57,070
Okay.

2542
01:46:58,150 --> 01:46:59,850
Oh, that's Jackie's room.

2543
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:05,010
Hello, I'm back here.

2544
01:47:10,230 --> 01:47:10,750
Yeah.

2545
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:11,010
Again?

2546
01:47:26,450 --> 01:47:27,730
Door locked doors?

2547
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:33,060
Oh, not vent.

2548
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:33,560
Oh!

2549
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,940
Yeah, I was gonna say, didn't I just do this?

2550
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:38,120
Why do I have to go back here?

2551
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:40,340
Oh, I'm being one guide.

2552
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:42,260
Typical Doki.

2553
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:44,840
Being one guide by several guys.

2554
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:50,670
Oh, this door.

2555
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:51,170
Oh!

2556
01:47:51,850 --> 01:47:52,510
Wait, no.

2557
01:47:52,590 --> 01:47:53,190
I was here.

2558
01:47:57,080 --> 01:47:58,580
This is the...

2559
01:47:58,580 --> 01:48:00,460
Happy birthday, miss...

2560
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:01,840
Wait, this one.

2561
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:04,080
Wait, this is new.

2562
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:08,400
Yeah, one squad.

2563
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:16,710
Yeah, I'm back.

2564
01:48:19,490 --> 01:48:20,390
Wait, no.

2565
01:48:21,650 --> 01:48:22,750
I'm not back.

2566
01:48:24,970 --> 01:48:25,610
Um...

2567
01:48:25,610 --> 01:48:26,630
Wait, no.

2568
01:48:31,690 --> 01:48:32,890
I'm not back.

2569
01:48:33,610 --> 01:48:35,050
I gotta go back.

2570
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:39,980
Didn't I come from here?

2571
01:48:40,900 --> 01:48:42,000
Well, I'm lost.

2572
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:44,360
Yeah, I guess she was like...

2573
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:47,340
Happy birthday, Mr. President.

2574
01:48:51,770 --> 01:48:53,910
Oh, the big door showroom!

2575
01:48:54,190 --> 01:48:54,310
Oh!

2576
01:48:55,790 --> 01:48:56,350
JK.

2577
01:48:57,770 --> 01:48:59,250
I was on the right track.

2578
01:49:00,130 --> 01:49:01,990
Guys, I'm so confused.

2579
01:49:05,630 --> 01:49:07,530
There's too many stairs.

2580
01:49:07,890 --> 01:49:09,350
There's too many choices.

2581
01:49:09,870 --> 01:49:11,250
Too many doors!

2582
01:49:13,810 --> 01:49:15,710
Oh, I don't like this clown.

2583
01:49:16,510 --> 01:49:18,290
That's not a sexy clown.

2584
01:49:19,850 --> 01:49:21,230
Oh, another puzzle.

2585
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:23,770
Okay, I know how to do puzzles, though.

2586
01:49:24,750 --> 01:49:26,070
Do you, Doki?

2587
01:49:26,910 --> 01:49:27,870
Yes, guys.

2588
01:49:28,130 --> 01:49:28,450
I know.

2589
01:49:28,690 --> 01:49:28,930
God.

2590
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:30,690
These controls, though.

2591
01:49:30,770 --> 01:49:31,590
Fucking sucks.

2592
01:49:32,090 --> 01:49:32,850
For the puzzles.

2593
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:34,470
Yeah.

2594
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:36,770
Like that.

2595
01:49:38,690 --> 01:49:39,850
And then...

2596
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:42,370
I don't like these controls, though.

2597
01:49:42,370 --> 01:49:43,010
For the puzzles.

2598
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:45,510
It doesn't bring me joy.

2599
01:49:47,070 --> 01:49:48,030
Like that.

2600
01:49:48,030 --> 01:49:49,030
And then...

2601
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:54,000
Okay.

2602
01:49:54,140 --> 01:49:54,980
That doesn't work.

2603
01:49:59,020 --> 01:49:59,500
Okay.

2604
01:49:59,700 --> 01:49:59,840
Wait.

2605
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,620
It's timed?

2606
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:02,300
Okay.

2607
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:02,960
Now I know.

2608
01:50:04,700 --> 01:50:05,180
Okay.

2609
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:06,220
Now I know it's time.

2610
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,220
Guys, the answer is not boobs.

2611
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,160
I'm very confident in that.

2612
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,160
Guys, I know for a fact...

2613
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:20,880
That the answer is not boobs.

2614
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:23,240
Oh, my God.

2615
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,060
I hate...

2616
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:25,560
Oh, I hate these controls.

2617
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:35,770
Okay.

2618
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:38,980
Oh, my God.

2619
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:39,380
Please.

2620
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:41,140
Okay.

2621
01:50:44,060 --> 01:50:44,580
No!

2622
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:45,140
Please!

2623
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:45,860
I'm gonna...

2624
01:50:52,010 --> 01:50:52,830
You're right.

2625
01:50:53,010 --> 01:50:53,870
It's boobs.

2626
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:55,210
Not a boob.

2627
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:03,380
I hate this.

2628
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:05,500
I hate this on mouse and keyboard.

2629
01:51:11,210 --> 01:51:11,970
Oh, my God.

2630
01:51:12,350 --> 01:51:12,750
Please!

2631
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:18,560
Oh, my God.

2632
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:18,780
I did it.

2633
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:18,980
Okay.

2634
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:19,400
There we go.

2635
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:20,580
I need help.

2636
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:22,800
Alright.

2637
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:24,520
We did it.

2638
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:26,640
Do your thing.

2639
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:27,660
I'm just gonna wait.

2640
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:28,300
Actually, no.

2641
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:28,780
Fuck it.

2642
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:29,500
I'm too lazy.

2643
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:30,720
I'm gonna wait it out.

2644
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:33,400
Oh!

2645
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:37,600
Yeah!

2646
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:37,840
Yeah!

2647
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:44,340
Experience the latest in carnival and midway game technologies.

2648
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:47,280
You're like...

2649
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:47,960
A man.

2650
01:51:48,140 --> 01:51:48,160
Test your skills.

2651
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,060
Test your luck.

2652
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:51,540
Win a prize or make a buck.

2653
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:51,780
Alright.

2654
01:51:52,020 --> 01:51:53,260
Give me a ticket, please.

2655
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:53,920
Ticket, please.

2656
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:56,240
If you'd like to license that jingle, inquire within the rates.

2657
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:57,080
Thank you.

2658
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:00,580
Here's my ticket.

2659
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:02,260
Hello!

2660
01:52:02,260 --> 01:52:02,400
Yeah!

2661
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:04,860
Oh.

2662
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:07,120
Oh.

2663
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:13,940
Whoever designed this robot definitely really hated children.

2664
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:16,620
You've come to the big-time showroom!

2665
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:21,640
Let us spend our money on that game.

2666
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:24,300
Tickets, please.

2667
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:25,940
Where's my...

2668
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:28,200
I enjoy time with my family.

2669
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:28,780
Oh.

2670
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:30,240
So many, right?

2671
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:32,800
Which game will I play first?

2672
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:33,560
Um...

2673
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:35,280
I'll play this game.

2674
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:37,500
Step right up and smack a clown!

2675
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:38,720
It can't be that hard.

2676
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:40,400
Ready, set...

2677
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:41,800
Where did the clown come from?

2678
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:43,380
Oh!

2679
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:44,800
It's just literally...

2680
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,000
Oh!

2681
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:46,500
It's just smacking the teeth.

2682
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:47,920
I know how to do that.

2683
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:49,860
Boom!

2684
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:51,940
Oh, I already lost.

2685
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:54,600
Okay, there's fall off damage!

2686
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,900
Oh wait, there's more than...

2687
01:52:57,900 --> 01:52:58,880
Okay, nice.

2688
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:01,300
I just aim for the nose?

2689
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:02,060
Oh, wait!

2690
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:02,960
I thought I...

2691
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:05,920
Alright, let's try.

2692
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:07,680
I got this.

2693
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:10,120
I thought I limited ammo.

2694
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:12,220
But I don't.

2695
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:15,100
Jeez.

2696
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:16,580
How much do I have to get?

2697
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:20,640
Oh, this is so easy.

2698
01:53:22,020 --> 01:53:22,540
Boom!

2699
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,420
Give me another one!

2700
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:26,280
I already won!

2701
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:29,020
That's fucking right!

2702
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:37,400
Ba-da-da-dum, ba-da-da-dum, ba-na-da-dum.

2703
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:39,740
So easy!

2704
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:41,940
That's fucking right!

2705
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:43,380
Give me my tickets!

2706
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:47,700
Oh, oh.

2707
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:52,200
Six, two, uh, oh,

2708
01:53:57,270 --> 01:53:57,990
six, six.

2709
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:11,760
This is better than ice cream.

2710
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:18,140
This is better than ice cream... 6, 2, 5... wait, what's that over there?

2711
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:18,780
Is that 7?

2712
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:22,120
I'm feeling evil, man, now.

2713
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:25,220
I am having so much fun.

2714
01:54:27,580 --> 01:54:30,200
I don't know, I thought he would cover me!

2715
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:33,940
I was like, oh, he's right in front of me.

2716
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:35,780
Can't get me now.

2717
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:39,780
Tickets, please.

2718
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:44,200
He was right in front of me!

2719
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:48,260
Oh, it's new now.

2720
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:52,940
6, 4, 9, 2, okay.

2721
01:54:57,260 --> 01:54:58,100
Tickets, please.

2722
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:00,220
Alright.

2723
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:02,340
6, 4, 9, 2.

2724
01:55:02,380 --> 01:55:03,340
Where do I go, though?

2725
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:12,460
I have to go to that locker.

2726
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:15,340
Okay, I gotta head to that one locker over there.

2727
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:18,600
Alright, guys, remember this.

2728
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:20,940
6, 4, 9, 2.

2729
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:24,140
Tickets, please.

2730
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:24,300
Please.

2731
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:32,580
No, he doesn't see me.

2732
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:43,910
I'm gonna make it, wait for him to turn around first.

2733
01:55:45,590 --> 01:55:47,050
Guys, it can't be boobs!

2734
01:55:48,190 --> 01:55:49,150
Oh, there's a 1.

2735
01:55:49,690 --> 01:55:50,850
Wait, what's the number?

2736
01:55:57,700 --> 01:55:58,620
Oh my god.

2737
01:55:58,900 --> 01:55:59,780
I think B...

2738
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:00,000
Oh!

2739
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:05,320
Whoops.

2740
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:09,180
I was gonna say, this area kills frames.

2741
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:10,980
Oh my god.

2742
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:23,620
Oh no, wait.

2743
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:30,180
Oh my god.

2744
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:36,920
Does he know?

2745
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:38,680
Oh, he knows.

2746
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:51,080
I got so overwhelmed looking at this.

2747
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:51,600
I'm sorry.

2748
01:56:51,940 --> 01:56:55,440
I saw this and I was like, what the fuck am I looking at?

2749
01:56:55,620 --> 01:56:57,480
I got so overwhelmed.

2750
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,060
I saw this.

2751
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:06,160
I was like, what the fuck?

2752
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:08,540
Oh my god.

2753
01:57:08,660 --> 01:57:09,180
Oh my god.

2754
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:10,000
Oh my god, he's...

2755
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:14,360
Hello.

2756
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:16,680
I have the ticket.

2757
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:22,200
He's slowly crawling towards me.

2758
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:23,740
What do I do?

2759
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:28,200
Oh my god, he's just...

2760
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:28,720
I need to know.

2761
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:31,780
I need to know how much data this game is taking me.

2762
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:32,220
I...

2763
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:33,260
I need to know.

2764
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:34,040
I'm curious.

2765
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:35,420
I put up my time.

2766
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:37,640
I need to know how much this game is...

2767
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:42,300
Why...

2768
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:43,420
Why...

2769
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:46,340
Why it's sucking up so much resources.

2770
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:54,920
Zero, three, eight.

2771
01:57:56,980 --> 01:57:59,800
I enjoy time with my family.

2772
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:01,680
Zero, eight, nine, five, four.

2773
01:58:02,860 --> 01:58:03,700
Pickets, please.

2774
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:05,520
Oh my god.

2775
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:08,280
My CPU goes to a hundred.

2776
01:58:08,780 --> 01:58:10,500
It's not even GPU.

2777
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:12,320
It's my CPU.

2778
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,340
It is at a hundred.

2779
01:58:14,900 --> 01:58:16,220
Holy shit.

2780
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:22,540
This game takes 62% of my CPU.

2781
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:28,420
It's at full capacity.

2782
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:34,480
Oh my...

2783
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:35,300
Wait, what do you mean by it?

2784
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:36,140
It's the encoder.

2785
01:58:40,210 --> 01:58:42,150
Oh my god.

2786
01:58:43,650 --> 01:58:45,510
Alright, it's time to shoot gun.

2787
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:48,050
It hungers for more.

2788
01:58:49,430 --> 01:58:49,870
Start.

2789
01:58:51,210 --> 01:58:51,930
QQ.

2790
01:58:58,960 --> 01:58:59,800
Oh my god.

2791
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:00,020
Oh my god.

2792
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:02,920
Why is the gun sensor so high when I have the gun?

2793
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:05,960
It's really fucking high.

2794
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:07,180
I wish I was joking.

2795
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:19,600
Oh my god.

2796
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:23,080
I moved like one inch and it's like across the screen.

2797
01:59:26,940 --> 01:59:27,780
Alright, nice.

2798
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:32,440
Okay, that has to be the...

2799
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:33,740
Okay, the high score is 25.

2800
01:59:34,120 --> 01:59:36,000
Guys, I think I beat the high score.

2801
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,160
Yeah.

2802
01:59:38,660 --> 01:59:39,500
Oh.

2803
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:43,440
It's tickets time.

2804
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:45,640
It's tickets time.

2805
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:46,360
It's ticket time.

2806
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:49,360
Tickets, please.

2807
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:52,840
Tickets, please.

2808
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:54,640
Oh my god.

2809
01:59:58,960 --> 01:59:59,960
Tickets, please.

2810
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:03,820
What if I play this game yet?

2811
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:09,260
If I play this game at... Alright, it's time to choose.

2812
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:10,440
Pick our poison.

2813
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:12,100
It's time to pick another one.

2814
02:00:16,660 --> 02:00:19,540
It's time to pick one more in the lower.

2815
02:00:22,300 --> 02:00:24,120
A global low.

2816
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:25,580
Anti-Alias?

2817
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:26,020
Alright.

2818
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:27,240
There we go.

2819
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:31,080
Time to pick another poison.

2820
02:00:32,020 --> 02:00:33,480
Okay, let's do...

2821
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:36,440
Oh, I forgot to... Oh, wait.

2822
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:36,860
Okay, wait.

2823
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:37,900
I need to do audio first.

2824
02:00:38,700 --> 02:00:39,180
Music.

2825
02:00:40,020 --> 02:00:41,340
I'll put music down.

2826
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:47,500
Okay, apparently I forgot to click apply for graphics.

2827
02:00:49,100 --> 02:00:49,580
Graphics.

2828
02:00:52,260 --> 02:00:52,740
Low.

2829
02:00:52,740 --> 02:00:53,220
Shadow.

2830
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:54,960
There we go.

2831
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:56,120
Apply.

2832
02:00:56,460 --> 02:00:59,320
I don't know if it'll fix anything, but maybe I won't be at 100.

2833
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:00,260
Oh, nope.

2834
02:01:08,100 --> 02:01:09,060
Never mind.

2835
02:01:16,590 --> 02:01:17,190
Okay.

2836
02:01:17,630 --> 02:01:19,930
I want to pay money to play this game.

2837
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:20,830
Alright, here we go.

2838
02:01:26,310 --> 02:01:29,250
It's literally only a certain area.

2839
02:01:29,430 --> 02:01:32,130
No, this game is not very optimized.

2840
02:01:32,990 --> 02:01:42,810
I read in the... I read in the reviews that you need a really, really tanky PC to play this game because it's not very well optimized.

2841
02:01:47,390 --> 02:01:49,330
The reviews were saying that.

2842
02:01:49,570 --> 02:01:50,010
They were like...

2843
02:01:50,410 --> 02:01:51,690
They were like...

2844
02:01:51,690 --> 02:01:51,730
They were like...

2845
02:01:51,730 --> 02:01:52,110
Oh, yeah.

2846
02:01:52,290 --> 02:01:52,470
No.

2847
02:01:52,830 --> 02:01:53,350
Like...

2848
02:01:53,350 --> 02:01:57,430
I have like a 4d9 and I can't even run this game.

2849
02:02:04,110 --> 02:02:06,190
What do you mean by it's the encoder?

2850
02:02:09,790 --> 02:02:10,430
Okay.

2851
02:02:10,870 --> 02:02:12,190
Oh, oh, oh.

2852
02:02:16,770 --> 02:02:18,690
Because I don't know PC talk.

2853
02:02:21,770 --> 02:02:25,070
Oh my god, I can't- fucking- Oh!

2854
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:40,040
Okay, clearly that's not- Oh my god, I still had this guy on.

2855
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:43,660
Oh my god, please.

2856
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:49,680
That's it.

2857
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:56,240
Just explain that, like, I don't know what PC is.

2858
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:58,940
We did it.

2859
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:01,240
Wait, there's a prize?

2860
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:02,300
Where's the prizes?

2861
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:04,560
I want my prizes.

2862
02:03:06,780 --> 02:03:08,400
I got a free spin?

2863
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:10,000
Where?

2864
02:03:12,460 --> 02:03:14,000
Get this gun out of here.

2865
02:03:15,660 --> 02:03:18,040
Oh, is OBS setting eating my CPU?

2866
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:20,520
Oh, it's because I'm in, like, 1440p.

2867
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:24,720
I need the new encoder on OBS?

2868
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:25,520
What do you mean?

2869
02:03:31,870 --> 02:03:33,090
Where's the free spin?

2870
02:03:33,270 --> 02:03:34,690
How do I spin the wheel?

2871
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:40,500
Where's the wheel?

2872
02:03:46,490 --> 02:03:47,090
A gun.

2873
02:03:48,610 --> 02:03:50,210
Oh, it's in the back room?

2874
02:03:50,430 --> 02:03:50,690
Oh!

2875
02:03:52,350 --> 02:03:54,410
I can't get enough of...

2876
02:03:54,410 --> 02:03:55,030
Ah!

2877
02:03:55,850 --> 02:03:57,450
I want prizes!

2878
02:04:02,370 --> 02:04:03,170
Alright.

2879
02:04:07,470 --> 02:04:08,770
What did I get?

2880
02:04:10,690 --> 02:04:12,510
Oh, I got another prize.

2881
02:04:12,930 --> 02:04:13,730
What did I get?

2882
02:04:13,990 --> 02:04:15,230
Oh, 15% discount?

2883
02:04:15,230 --> 02:04:15,270
Yeah.

2884
02:04:15,770 --> 02:04:17,570
We love prizes!

2885
02:04:18,310 --> 02:04:18,710
Spin, spin, spin, spin!

2886
02:04:18,710 --> 02:04:19,090
Wee!

2887
02:04:19,450 --> 02:04:20,470
Spin, spin, spin!

2888
02:04:22,790 --> 02:04:25,290
A lifetime supply of candy?!

2889
02:04:25,790 --> 02:04:28,090
What are the odds?

2890
02:04:29,230 --> 02:04:30,430
Where is it?

2891
02:04:31,990 --> 02:04:32,350
Hello?

2892
02:04:34,090 --> 02:04:35,190
Where's my...

2893
02:04:36,070 --> 02:04:37,210
Where is it?

2894
02:04:37,390 --> 02:04:39,890
I want my lifetime supply of candy!

2895
02:04:41,670 --> 02:04:42,870
Where is it?

2896
02:04:43,250 --> 02:04:43,550
Where is it?

2897
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:50,720
Oh my god.

2898
02:04:50,900 --> 02:04:51,360
The...

2899
02:04:52,220 --> 02:04:54,680
I can't believe he lied at me.

2900
02:04:54,920 --> 02:04:55,480
Take my wallet!

2901
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:58,160
Oh, I have another gun.

2902
02:04:58,600 --> 02:04:59,680
Step right up and...

2903
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:01,680
But what if I can have two guns?

2904
02:05:02,540 --> 02:05:04,400
Shoot the targets to win a spin!

2905
02:05:05,580 --> 02:05:06,180
Ready!

2906
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:06,500
Set!

2907
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:08,120
Oh, it's a nice shooting game.

2908
02:05:10,180 --> 02:05:11,980
Okay, there is not enough variety.

2909
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:19,520
The same team as the last one!

2910
02:05:25,590 --> 02:05:26,190
Okay.

2911
02:05:26,710 --> 02:05:27,310
Easy.

2912
02:05:27,990 --> 02:05:29,490
I think I already passed.

2913
02:05:29,650 --> 02:05:31,230
I think I already succeeded this level.

2914
02:05:32,690 --> 02:05:36,010
Wait, the sensitivity for this one is not as bad this time.

2915
02:05:37,390 --> 02:05:38,630
Check this, please.

2916
02:05:39,850 --> 02:05:42,310
Oh yeah, I'm already, like, way ahead.

2917
02:05:43,770 --> 02:05:44,310
Yay!

2918
02:05:45,410 --> 02:05:46,970
Okay, we gotta stop here.

2919
02:05:47,410 --> 02:05:48,010
Nice.

2920
02:05:51,890 --> 02:05:53,850
We have a winner!

2921
02:05:53,930 --> 02:05:54,270
Yay!

2922
02:05:55,530 --> 02:05:56,410
Tickets, please.

2923
02:05:56,410 --> 02:05:56,890
And what did you win?

2924
02:05:57,010 --> 02:05:57,790
Oh, did I win?

2925
02:05:58,790 --> 02:06:01,930
A free spin on the prize wheel!

2926
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:02,490
Yay!

2927
02:06:03,050 --> 02:06:06,070
And what a prize wheel to redeem your free spin!

2928
02:06:08,170 --> 02:06:09,190
Tickets, please.

2929
02:06:16,530 --> 02:06:17,530
Tickets, please.

2930
02:06:17,530 --> 02:06:17,830
Tickets, please.

2931
02:06:18,450 --> 02:06:19,130
Tickets, please.

2932
02:06:23,010 --> 02:06:24,430
What if I shoot it?

2933
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:30,040
Do I win?

2934
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:31,140
No, I can't win!

2935
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:32,540
I can't win!

2936
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:32,580
No!

2937
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:34,220
No...

2938
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:40,200
You're stupid!

2939
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:41,400
I'm sorry!

2940
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:42,360
No!

2941
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:49,660
What is he looking at?

2942
02:06:51,860 --> 02:06:53,180
He's over there.

2943
02:06:54,060 --> 02:06:55,260
Tickets, please.

2944
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:57,780
Tickets, please.

2945
02:07:04,760 --> 02:07:05,760
That's right.

2946
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:07,800
I'm never sorry.

2947
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:09,840
I'll do it again.

2948
02:07:10,780 --> 02:07:11,580
Alright.

2949
02:07:12,220 --> 02:07:13,960
Here we go again.

2950
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:17,280
Okay.

2951
02:07:19,720 --> 02:07:21,180
How do I do it like this?

2952
02:07:22,660 --> 02:07:24,140
Then... Oh, that doesn't work.

2953
02:07:24,340 --> 02:07:25,240
Oh, that doesn't work.

2954
02:07:27,740 --> 02:07:28,340
Okay.

2955
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:42,040
And then... There we go.

2956
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:42,440
Yeah!

2957
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:46,500
That's fucking right!

2958
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:47,920
I solved the puzzle!

2959
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:50,160
What you gonna do now?

2960
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:52,360
Slowly walk towards me?

2961
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:54,720
Ha ha ha!

2962
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:56,620
Tickets, please.

2963
02:07:57,020 --> 02:08:04,380
Four, three, five, eight.

2964
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:05,800
What are these numbers?

2965
02:08:06,460 --> 02:08:06,940
Alright.

2966
02:08:08,140 --> 02:08:09,200
10.

2967
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:11,060
Wheel of prizes.

2968
02:08:11,500 --> 02:08:12,760
Spin, wheel, spin.

2969
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:14,560
A mystery puzzle.

2970
02:08:17,780 --> 02:08:20,820
Just try again and expect a different result.

2971
02:08:20,860 --> 02:08:21,460
I don't know.

2972
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:26,700
I said, let's have supply pie!

2973
02:08:27,340 --> 02:08:29,800
What the fuck is my pie?!

2974
02:08:38,610 --> 02:08:40,510
I have one more spin!

2975
02:08:40,970 --> 02:08:42,230
One more spin!

2976
02:08:52,220 --> 02:08:53,060
That's right!

2977
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:54,120
A grand prize!

2978
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:54,840
A door!

2979
02:08:55,980 --> 02:08:57,220
Home of the original.

2980
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:58,040
Can you know that?

2981
02:08:58,040 --> 02:09:00,300
Oh my god, guys!

2982
02:09:00,620 --> 02:09:01,170
I got...

2983
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:03,360
What I've always wanted!

2984
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:04,680
A fucking door!

2985
02:09:08,540 --> 02:09:09,400
Oh, hey!

2986
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:10,960
Look!

2987
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:12,180
That's it!

2988
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:13,960
Most valued customer!

2989
02:09:14,300 --> 02:09:16,200
That just means I spend the most money!

2990
02:09:18,820 --> 02:09:19,920
Oh, he's gone!

2991
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:21,540
Wait, what happened to him?

2992
02:09:23,420 --> 02:09:25,540
How would I get my ticket now?!

2993
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:31,160
Sorry!

2994
02:09:31,460 --> 02:09:33,980
Hoor, hoor, hoor, hoor, hoor, hoor, hoor, hoor, hoor!

2995
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:36,800
That's what I meant!

2996
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,760
Uh, crown...

2997
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:40,780
Where's the crown guy?

2998
02:09:49,030 --> 02:09:49,630
One...

2999
02:09:50,370 --> 02:09:51,450
Where's the cowboy?

3000
02:09:53,230 --> 02:09:54,190
Is that cowboy?

3001
02:09:57,910 --> 02:09:58,570
Wait...

3002
02:09:58,570 --> 02:09:59,790
Is that a cowboy hat?

3003
02:10:01,810 --> 02:10:03,530
No, that's a...

3004
02:10:03,530 --> 02:10:04,270
Farm hat!

3005
02:10:04,750 --> 02:10:06,710
One, five...

3006
02:10:09,390 --> 02:10:10,380
One, five...

3007
02:10:12,410 --> 02:10:13,070
Nine...

3008
02:10:13,070 --> 02:10:13,670
Four.

3009
02:10:13,750 --> 02:10:14,450
One, five, nine, four.

3010
02:10:15,810 --> 02:10:16,470
One...

3011
02:10:17,290 --> 02:10:17,950
Five...

3012
02:10:17,950 --> 02:10:19,270
Nine...

3013
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:19,970
Four...

3014
02:10:19,970 --> 02:10:20,450
Wait, what?

3015
02:10:21,910 --> 02:10:23,310
Another cowboy hat?

3016
02:10:25,190 --> 02:10:26,030
Is that missing?

3017
02:10:26,230 --> 02:10:27,290
Is that a cowboy hat?

3018
02:10:28,150 --> 02:10:29,910
Does it look like a cowboy hat?

3019
02:10:30,330 --> 02:10:30,650
Zero.

3020
02:10:37,120 --> 02:10:38,960
One, zero, nine, four.

3021
02:10:41,340 --> 02:10:41,780
One...

3022
02:10:42,860 --> 02:10:43,300
Zero...

3023
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:44,800
Nine...

3024
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:45,260
Four.

3025
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:45,960
There you go.

3026
02:10:46,420 --> 02:10:48,340
Oh, that wasn't even a cowboy hat!

3027
02:10:51,140 --> 02:10:55,400
I know I have a lot more to this game because I have three other symbols that I haven't unlocked yet.

3028
02:10:56,780 --> 02:10:57,440
So...

3029
02:10:57,440 --> 02:10:58,180
I know.

3030
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:00,280
I have a long way to go.

3031
02:11:00,380 --> 02:11:01,190
Oh, I got my...

3032
02:11:01,540 --> 02:11:04,420
No, two more symbols I haven't locked yet.

3033
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:04,960
Let's go!

3034
02:11:05,860 --> 02:11:06,920
My trophy!

3035
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:07,920
Oh!

3036
02:11:13,900 --> 02:11:14,560
No!

3037
02:11:19,180 --> 02:11:19,840
No!

3038
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:22,100
My trophy!

3039
02:11:23,200 --> 02:11:25,940
I got to absorb with the...

3040
02:11:31,270 --> 02:11:32,150
Oh, shit.

3041
02:11:32,350 --> 02:11:32,930
What the fuck?

3042
02:11:34,330 --> 02:11:35,250
Guys, I...

3043
02:11:36,010 --> 02:11:37,290
I did it again.

3044
02:11:38,090 --> 02:11:38,990
Alright, I fixed it.

3045
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:45,800
There we go.

3046
02:11:49,820 --> 02:11:50,160
Yeah!

3047
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:54,920
I actually forgot any of the rooms that require this upgrade.

3048
02:11:56,040 --> 02:11:57,060
Can I go back for it?

3049
02:11:59,060 --> 02:12:00,560
Because I need my trophy.

3050
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:03,040
I need to know that I did a good job.

3051
02:12:03,560 --> 02:12:05,000
I need validation.

3052
02:12:06,640 --> 02:12:07,400
Oh, yeah.

3053
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:10,780
Got my trophy.

3054
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:12,180
Most value customer.

3055
02:12:12,680 --> 02:12:14,380
Because I have a credit card.

3056
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:18,820
Where did I put this?

3057
02:12:19,420 --> 02:12:20,580
Where is Rufax this?

3058
02:12:26,460 --> 02:12:27,640
Oh, there it is.

3059
02:12:28,180 --> 02:12:29,600
I knew there had to be.

3060
02:12:30,180 --> 02:12:30,700
Whoop!

3061
02:12:33,640 --> 02:12:37,380
Ed, I hope this message reaches you as soon as you get a break.

3062
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:39,900
I have to go help the Fall Fest crew.

3063
02:12:40,180 --> 02:12:43,140
Just for a few days until the installation is finished.

3064
02:12:44,780 --> 02:12:46,080
It's hard to explain.

3065
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:51,120
I just have this terrible feeling like I need to be there so nothing goes wrong.

3066
02:12:51,660 --> 02:12:52,680
Just in case.

3067
02:12:53,440 --> 02:12:55,540
Trisha will babysit David while I'm gone.

3068
02:12:55,860 --> 02:12:58,640
I love you both, and I'll be back next week.

3069
02:12:58,640 --> 02:12:59,220
Hmm.

3070
02:13:00,580 --> 02:13:02,380
And she never came back.

3071
02:13:03,980 --> 02:13:06,100
Wait, I have to get the... my gun?

3072
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:09,840
Okay, but do I... I already got the achievement where I shot somebody with a gun.

3073
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:12,260
Alright.

3074
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:13,640
Is that a collectible?

3075
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:15,520
Wait, is a gun a collectible?

3076
02:13:19,560 --> 02:13:20,920
Yeah, I'll go back downstairs.

3077
02:13:26,080 --> 02:13:26,540
Wait.

3078
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:28,060
Where did I leave my gun?

3079
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:36,960
Guys, I don't think I can get my gun back.

3080
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:40,100
Oh!

3081
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:41,960
Wait, no, that's not my... yeah, guys.

3082
02:13:43,740 --> 02:13:45,340
Wait, did I drop my gun?

3083
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:46,360
I don't remember.

3084
02:13:47,860 --> 02:13:49,420
I remember I threw my gun.

3085
02:13:52,140 --> 02:13:53,120
Can't see.

3086
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:53,820
Can't see.

3087
02:13:53,820 --> 02:13:54,200
So dark.

3088
02:13:54,620 --> 02:13:55,440
So dark.

3089
02:13:56,480 --> 02:13:58,520
Okay, I think it... it disappeared.

3090
02:13:58,800 --> 02:13:59,580
I think it despawned.

3091
02:14:03,940 --> 02:14:06,420
I'm pretty sure the gun despawned.

3092
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:09,160
Too late.

3093
02:14:10,280 --> 02:14:11,580
It's gone forever.

3094
02:14:11,580 --> 02:14:11,820
Whatever.

3095
02:14:13,560 --> 02:14:14,860
No more gun.

3096
02:14:15,900 --> 02:14:16,980
I wanna make sure I got...

3097
02:14:16,980 --> 02:14:18,200
Oh wait, there's another TV.

3098
02:14:20,360 --> 02:14:21,300
What's on this TV?

3099
02:14:25,860 --> 02:14:26,940
Anything important?

3100
02:14:29,980 --> 02:14:30,300
Nope.

3101
02:14:31,100 --> 02:14:31,840
Just a TV.

3102
02:14:39,100 --> 02:14:39,740
Alright.

3103
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:43,380
This is time to go to the roof.

3104
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:47,160
Unlock roof.

3105
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:54,920
Hello?

3106
02:14:55,560 --> 02:14:56,400
Anybody here?

3107
02:14:56,700 --> 02:14:56,980
Ooh.

3108
02:14:57,480 --> 02:14:58,860
Watch out for exposed wiring.

3109
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,760
Okay, why don't you just fix the wiring?

3110
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:07,820
Hello?

3111
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:10,140
Wait, it's snowing now.

3112
02:15:18,810 --> 02:15:24,090
Okay, why don't they just fix it instead of giving me a fucking sign to be like, Watch out!

3113
02:15:24,270 --> 02:15:26,530
We're not gonna fix it, but watch out!

3114
02:15:33,150 --> 02:15:38,770
If you have time to write me a be careful sign, you have time to fix this.

3115
02:15:41,230 --> 02:15:43,390
Alright, do you guys spamming really hard?

3116
02:15:43,990 --> 02:15:46,990
I might spam them out if they're spamming too much.

3117
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:58,940
Oh hey, tickets please.

3118
02:15:59,420 --> 02:15:59,880
Hi.

3119
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:06,380
I don't have my ticket, I'm sorry!

3120
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:10,080
Oh, okay.

3121
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:12,400
Did he accept my apology?

3122
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:14,260
Oh, I did it.

3123
02:16:16,620 --> 02:16:18,160
Oh, I'm sorry!

3124
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:21,140
I'm sorry!

3125
02:16:21,140 --> 02:16:23,000
I don't have my tickets!

3126
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:24,900
I used it all!

3127
02:16:25,100 --> 02:16:25,280
No!

3128
02:16:27,320 --> 02:16:29,500
I used all my tickets!

3129
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:31,820
Oh, you can't get through that.

3130
02:16:31,940 --> 02:16:33,060
I know you can't.

3131
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:34,520
Oh!

3132
02:16:43,270 --> 02:16:45,010
I do- Okay!

3133
02:16:45,350 --> 02:16:48,990
I assume he was too thick for the door!

3134
02:16:49,270 --> 02:16:52,670
I guess he can- Okay!

3135
02:16:53,090 --> 02:16:56,930
Like, I assume that he was too big for the door!

3136
02:16:57,910 --> 02:17:02,930
Fuck me for not- For forgetting that he could just smash through it!

3137
02:17:02,930 --> 02:17:03,430
Okay!

3138
02:17:03,430 --> 02:17:07,010
And he turned that- I'm gonna stop playing with it!

3139
02:17:08,070 --> 02:17:10,550
They knew- Okay!

3140
02:17:10,950 --> 02:17:13,250
But like- Rationally!

3141
02:17:13,550 --> 02:17:15,590
He was too thick for that door!

3142
02:17:15,890 --> 02:17:18,630
So I assumed that I could just stand there!

3143
02:17:19,750 --> 02:17:22,750
He wasn't too big for the ceiling!

3144
02:17:23,590 --> 02:17:25,550
Oh my- Oh my god!

3145
02:17:25,890 --> 02:17:27,470
Of course- Of course!

3146
02:17:27,810 --> 02:17:29,230
They blocked the door!

3147
02:17:29,790 --> 02:17:30,770
There you go!

3148
02:17:31,070 --> 02:17:31,870
It gets these!

3149
02:17:33,230 --> 02:17:34,230
Tickets, please!

3150
02:17:36,730 --> 02:17:37,750
Tickets, please!

3151
02:17:41,150 --> 02:17:42,190
Tickets, please!

3152
02:17:43,050 --> 02:17:44,110
Tickets, please!

3153
02:17:44,230 --> 02:17:45,170
Tickets, please!

3154
02:17:47,310 --> 02:17:47,910
Tickets, please!

3155
02:17:48,070 --> 02:17:49,870
I'm crawling as fast as I can!

3156
02:17:50,210 --> 02:17:51,430
Tickets, please!

3157
02:17:53,450 --> 02:17:54,570
Tickets, please!

3158
02:17:55,610 --> 02:17:55,810
Tickets, please!

3159
02:17:55,810 --> 02:17:56,650
Tickets, please!

3160
02:17:57,910 --> 02:17:58,710
Tickets, please!

3161
02:17:58,710 --> 02:17:58,890
Oh!

3162
02:17:59,250 --> 02:17:59,310
Oh!

3163
02:18:02,910 --> 02:18:03,810
Jesus Christ!

3164
02:18:04,950 --> 02:18:07,750
Surely I can safely go through here, right?

3165
02:18:08,890 --> 02:18:11,170
But, like, I can go through here now, right?

3166
02:18:12,010 --> 02:18:12,790
Kids, please.

3167
02:18:15,790 --> 02:18:17,370
Okay, that seems safe.

3168
02:18:20,310 --> 02:18:21,430
I don't know anymore.

3169
02:18:26,580 --> 02:18:28,860
Oh, I don't want to touch these guys.

3170
02:18:29,740 --> 02:18:33,360
They're, like, they're just gonna scream and be like, man, I wish I could paint.

3171
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:33,860
Woo!

3172
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:37,400
What the?

3173
02:18:44,020 --> 02:18:45,780
It was not safe.

3174
02:18:46,020 --> 02:18:47,540
It was not safe.

3175
02:18:47,740 --> 02:18:49,940
It was not safe, guys.

3176
02:19:10,510 --> 02:19:11,190
Not safe.

3177
02:19:11,370 --> 02:19:12,070
Not safe.

3178
02:19:12,250 --> 02:19:12,910
Not safe.

3179
02:19:13,130 --> 02:19:14,110
Where do I go?

3180
02:19:16,590 --> 02:19:17,310
Oh!

3181
02:19:17,550 --> 02:19:17,930
Hello!

3182
02:19:20,450 --> 02:19:20,810
Yay!

3183
02:19:27,610 --> 02:19:28,170
Yay!

3184
02:19:33,740 --> 02:19:36,320
Guys, he doesn't like freeloaders, guys.

3185
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:38,880
Alright.

3186
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:43,060
It's like those trained people that are like, Ticket, please.

3187
02:19:45,620 --> 02:19:47,960
What the fuck do you mean, don't get lazy?

3188
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:50,780
I got fucking chased by a ticket, man!

3189
02:19:50,780 --> 02:19:53,540
I found the location of another upgrade station.

3190
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:54,000
It's a no ticket.

3191
02:19:54,900 --> 02:19:56,300
No, it's like no bitches.

3192
02:19:58,100 --> 02:19:59,740
Bro just wanted some tickets.

3193
02:20:00,540 --> 02:20:03,800
Yeah, and he, and my fucking dispatcher didn't give me no tickets.

3194
02:20:06,020 --> 02:20:07,820
Where the fuck were my tickets, dispatcher?

3195
02:20:07,820 --> 02:20:08,940
Hey, buddy.

3196
02:20:08,940 --> 02:20:10,560
Check in when you have a chance.

3197
02:20:12,420 --> 02:20:13,140
Alright.

3198
02:20:14,940 --> 02:20:16,000
I'm gonna check in.

3199
02:20:16,540 --> 02:20:17,300
No tickets?

3200
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:19,080
Hello.

3201
02:20:21,320 --> 02:20:24,140
I am dying to know what happened in there.

3202
02:20:26,020 --> 02:20:30,040
The system was flooded with alarms and alerts, and then it all stopped.

3203
02:20:31,600 --> 02:20:33,320
I'm guessing you took care of it.

3204
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,240
Well done.

3205
02:20:36,160 --> 02:20:37,060
No, no, no.

3206
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:38,680
I almost died again.

3207
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:40,240
You need to send help.

3208
02:20:40,240 --> 02:20:40,700
I can't talk?

3209
02:20:40,980 --> 02:20:41,720
Get me out of here now.

3210
02:20:42,020 --> 02:20:43,100
Oh my god, wait.

3211
02:20:43,320 --> 02:20:45,080
A rational main character?

3212
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:50,040
First, the system says the data diver was updated to include creator permissions.

3213
02:20:50,880 --> 02:20:52,160
I have free will?

3214
02:20:52,420 --> 02:20:53,440
I guess that means you're an artist now.

3215
02:20:53,620 --> 02:20:54,260
Good job.

3216
02:20:54,440 --> 02:20:55,680
I knew you could do it.

3217
02:20:56,760 --> 02:21:01,900
As for your real job, your next target is the upgrade station in the demonstration theater.

3218
02:21:03,020 --> 02:21:03,940
Check the map.

3219
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:05,860
You can get there through the workshops.

3220
02:21:07,900 --> 02:21:09,660
Yeah, check the map.

3221
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:18,340
Uh...

3222
02:21:18,340 --> 02:21:19,220
Oh, okay.

3223
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:20,540
It's already there.

3224
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:22,100
Wait, where's there?

3225
02:21:26,090 --> 02:21:26,930
Oh, okay.

3226
02:21:27,090 --> 02:21:28,450
It's the door with the elephant.

3227
02:21:30,770 --> 02:21:31,870
I got you.

3228
02:21:33,230 --> 02:21:35,030
Oh, he had only 30...

3229
02:21:35,030 --> 02:21:37,250
He was up for 36 hours already.

3230
02:21:40,410 --> 02:21:40,990
Alright.

3231
02:21:41,290 --> 02:21:41,990
Tickets, please.

3232
02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:45,150
This should be lit.

3233
02:21:47,350 --> 02:21:47,850
Yeah?

3234
02:21:48,330 --> 02:21:49,450
No, that's the theater.

3235
02:21:49,670 --> 02:21:49,810
Oh, wait.

3236
02:21:49,950 --> 02:21:50,250
No, yeah.

3237
02:21:51,550 --> 02:21:52,790
He wanted me to go to the theater.

3238
02:21:58,660 --> 02:21:59,840
How much money I get?

3239
02:22:00,200 --> 02:22:02,980
25 whole dollars for two slices...

3240
02:22:02,980 --> 02:22:06,460
For two slices of pizza at Freddy Fazbear Pizzeria.

3241
02:22:06,460 --> 02:22:09,420
Get right now for 9.99.

3242
02:22:18,440 --> 02:22:20,640
Oh, there's lockers.

3243
02:22:21,060 --> 02:22:21,980
Oh, no, no, no.

3244
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:23,560
Oh, no, no.

3245
02:22:24,480 --> 02:22:26,120
Oh, there's lockers.

3246
02:22:39,160 --> 02:22:40,040
Oh, no.

3247
02:22:41,940 --> 02:22:42,440
I lost my hand.

3248
02:22:42,460 --> 02:22:42,480
Oh.

3249
02:22:52,990 --> 02:22:53,430
Oh.

3250
02:22:55,750 --> 02:22:56,190
Oh.

3251
02:22:57,490 --> 02:22:57,930
Oh.

3252
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:06,480
Oh.

3253
02:23:06,480 --> 02:23:06,960
I fucked it.

3254
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:07,340
No!

3255
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:08,260
I fucked it up!

3256
02:23:08,440 --> 02:23:08,500
No!

3257
02:23:08,620 --> 02:23:09,580
My hand's still in there!

3258
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:10,540
You can't go!

3259
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:12,320
Nevermind.

3260
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:13,280
I lost the hand.

3261
02:23:13,940 --> 02:23:14,720
Come on!

3262
02:23:17,060 --> 02:23:18,520
You can't close it!

3263
02:23:18,580 --> 02:23:19,980
My hand's right in there!

3264
02:23:33,180 --> 02:23:35,680
He can and he will close it.

3265
02:23:35,720 --> 02:23:36,140
There we go.

3266
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:42,280
I feel like something's gonna be in front of me.

3267
02:23:45,790 --> 02:23:47,710
It is such a bitch to rotate.

3268
02:23:48,050 --> 02:23:49,170
It actually is.

3269
02:23:53,690 --> 02:23:54,990
I hear someone.

3270
02:23:55,770 --> 02:23:57,390
Just walking over.

3271
02:23:58,170 --> 02:23:59,570
Just waddling, honestly.

3272
02:24:00,590 --> 02:24:01,530
Who's that?

3273
02:24:04,030 --> 02:24:07,390
I feel like this game was originally made for VR.

3274
02:24:07,690 --> 02:24:08,670
And then VR died.

3275
02:24:08,910 --> 02:24:11,030
And then they ported it to like a beat.

3276
02:24:11,610 --> 02:24:14,330
And then they ported it here.

3277
02:24:18,460 --> 02:24:21,660
This feels like it was originally made for VR.

3278
02:24:28,700 --> 02:24:32,320
Yeah, because a lot of the puzzles require me to move my hands.

3279
02:24:36,260 --> 02:24:37,000
Who's that?

3280
02:24:37,240 --> 02:24:37,980
Oh, it's B!

3281
02:24:38,360 --> 02:24:39,220
Oh my god.

3282
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:40,440
He is...

3283
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:40,960
Worse.

3284
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:44,400
He looks a lot worse.

3285
02:24:49,780 --> 02:24:52,860
Ever since the show got cancelled, he wasn't the same.

3286
02:25:02,940 --> 02:25:03,780
What the fuck?

3287
02:25:03,900 --> 02:25:04,280
He's just...

3288
02:25:04,660 --> 02:25:05,620
camping me.

3289
02:25:18,520 --> 02:25:20,160
I don't know where to go.

3290
02:25:20,600 --> 02:25:22,820
Like, I don't know what power I fixed in general.

3291
02:25:25,580 --> 02:25:27,380
Like, what the fuck did I fix?

3292
02:25:30,700 --> 02:25:31,460
A fence?

3293
02:25:37,700 --> 02:25:39,320
No object permanence.

3294
02:25:39,320 --> 02:25:39,360
No object permanence.

3295
02:25:41,380 --> 02:25:42,760
Where did I go?

3296
02:25:43,100 --> 02:25:44,940
I don't even know myself.

3297
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:46,840
That's right.

3298
02:25:49,820 --> 02:25:51,300
I don't know what to do though.

3299
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:55,220
Bro, he's fucking huge.

3300
02:25:55,340 --> 02:25:55,560
How...

3301
02:25:55,560 --> 02:25:56,660
How much does he weigh?

3302
02:25:56,800 --> 02:25:59,080
He's literally vibrating the floor right now.

3303
02:26:07,590 --> 02:26:09,130
There's no lockers here.

3304
02:26:09,130 --> 02:26:10,390
There's no lockers here.

3305
02:26:10,390 --> 02:26:11,150
There's no...

3306
02:26:11,150 --> 02:26:11,370
No!

3307
02:26:11,610 --> 02:26:13,390
I thought there was a locker!

3308
02:26:13,930 --> 02:26:14,510
Ah!

3309
02:26:15,590 --> 02:26:18,570
I thought there was a locker there!

3310
02:26:25,050 --> 02:26:25,650
Okay.

3311
02:26:26,950 --> 02:26:27,410
Alright.

3312
02:26:29,510 --> 02:26:31,530
I couldn't see it!

3313
02:26:31,670 --> 02:26:32,830
I was blind!

3314
02:26:36,230 --> 02:26:36,790
Wait.

3315
02:26:36,910 --> 02:26:37,710
What the fuck is that?

3316
02:26:37,790 --> 02:26:38,370
That's a banana!

3317
02:26:39,870 --> 02:26:40,830
What is that?

3318
02:26:42,210 --> 02:26:44,330
He heard a Playstation is making another...

3319
02:26:44,330 --> 02:26:44,530
Oh yeah.

3320
02:26:44,590 --> 02:26:46,030
I heard they're making a Playstation 6.

3321
02:26:47,090 --> 02:26:49,110
Maybe they'll put games on it this time.

3322
02:26:58,870 --> 02:27:00,890
I want the grand prize.

3323
02:27:01,350 --> 02:27:01,830
No you don't.

3324
02:27:03,550 --> 02:27:04,110
Yay!

3325
02:27:05,870 --> 02:27:07,370
Oh, he doesn't hear that!

3326
02:27:07,570 --> 02:27:10,150
But here's my tiny ass fucking stick legs!

3327
02:27:11,790 --> 02:27:13,690
He hears my stick legs!

3328
02:27:14,190 --> 02:27:16,270
I can't even fucking jump!

3329
02:27:19,250 --> 02:27:19,770
Wait.

3330
02:27:19,910 --> 02:27:21,130
I don't know if I should go down here.

3331
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:28,560
I heard you didn't like Honey and Nuts and your Honey and that Cheerios.

3332
02:27:28,980 --> 02:27:29,840
Thank you for the Super Chat.

3333
02:27:30,100 --> 02:27:30,260
Thank you.

3334
02:27:30,340 --> 02:27:31,520
Thank you Gladstone.

3335
02:27:32,520 --> 02:27:33,740
Notice to all workers.

3336
02:27:34,340 --> 02:27:37,620
All late night shenanigans are to stop immediately.

3337
02:27:38,060 --> 02:27:41,880
I have some very important TV people coming to look at the show template.

3338
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:44,240
I can't have the projector breaking again.

3339
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:47,520
Oh.

3340
02:27:48,940 --> 02:27:49,920
Anything here?

3341
02:27:50,300 --> 02:27:51,400
I don't think so.

3342
02:27:52,320 --> 02:27:53,100
Let me uh...

3343
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:54,740
Chat died.

3344
02:27:54,900 --> 02:27:56,520
So I gotta fix that real quick, guys.

3345
02:27:56,660 --> 02:27:56,820
Sorry.

3346
02:27:58,840 --> 02:28:00,020
Immersion lost!

3347
02:28:00,480 --> 02:28:00,960
Alright, there we go.

3348
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:04,260
Oh hey, there's a movie here.

3349
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:06,200
Free movie!

3350
02:28:06,500 --> 02:28:07,080
Movie night!

3351
02:28:09,220 --> 02:28:10,020
Movie night?

3352
02:28:10,140 --> 02:28:10,700
Oh, wait.

3353
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:11,920
Wait, who took the movie?

3354
02:28:12,940 --> 02:28:13,580
No!

3355
02:28:13,900 --> 02:28:15,840
Somebody ruined free movie night!

3356
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:18,800
Who the fuck ruined free movie night?

3357
02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:23,820
Alright.

3358
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:25,180
Do I have any new logs?

3359
02:28:25,380 --> 02:28:25,560
No.

3360
02:28:26,740 --> 02:28:27,100
Okay.

3361
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:27,140
Okay.

3362
02:28:28,740 --> 02:28:29,180
And...

3363
02:28:31,220 --> 02:28:32,520
I don't think there's anything here.

3364
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:34,060
Wait, can I open this?

3365
02:28:34,120 --> 02:28:34,620
Oh, I can.

3366
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:36,500
What's in here?

3367
02:28:36,900 --> 02:28:37,740
Oh, there you go!

3368
02:28:37,800 --> 02:28:38,840
There's my free movie!

3369
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:43,140
That's the shittiest fucking safe I've ever seen.

3370
02:28:44,580 --> 02:28:45,720
Didn't even have a path.

3371
02:28:45,820 --> 02:28:47,460
It was just like, do this puzzle.

3372
02:28:47,740 --> 02:28:51,220
Do this three-year-old puzzle to see if you have had eye coordination.

3373
02:28:55,870 --> 02:28:56,550
Oh, it's Fiona!

3374
02:28:56,550 --> 02:28:57,670
You look terrible!

3375
02:28:58,190 --> 02:28:58,690
Oh, it's Fiona!

3376
02:29:00,310 --> 02:29:00,690
Ah!

3377
02:29:00,690 --> 02:29:01,910
So much to do by morning.

3378
02:29:02,170 --> 02:29:04,770
I'll never be ready for my big presentation.

3379
02:29:05,910 --> 02:29:08,030
All I wanna do is sleep.

3380
02:29:08,030 --> 02:29:08,970
This is...

3381
02:29:08,970 --> 02:29:12,170
Sorry, they had like, ten dollars for the animation budget.

3382
02:29:13,550 --> 02:29:14,630
Stay up late.

3383
02:29:15,030 --> 02:29:15,350
No.

3384
02:29:15,970 --> 02:29:16,630
Latte.

3385
02:29:16,630 --> 02:29:17,730
No shadow.

3386
02:29:19,060 --> 02:29:19,730
No shadow.

3387
02:29:20,010 --> 02:29:20,710
Immersion ruin.

3388
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:23,590
Is this annoying orange?

3389
02:29:24,390 --> 02:29:27,570
Rich and roasted, yet creamy and sweet.

3390
02:29:28,350 --> 02:29:29,310
Give me more!

3391
02:29:29,950 --> 02:29:31,570
That's Murray's secret recipe.

3392
02:29:31,850 --> 02:29:37,170
This day a latte creates the perfect cup of coffee suited to you.

3393
02:29:37,530 --> 02:29:39,430
This is your coffee habit.

3394
02:29:39,910 --> 02:29:42,690
I know what you want better than you do.

3395
02:29:42,910 --> 02:29:45,710
I am always watching, watching and learning.

3396
02:29:46,170 --> 02:29:47,490
Oh, that's not scary.

3397
02:29:47,690 --> 02:29:48,550
That's just AI!

3398
02:29:48,970 --> 02:29:49,250
Look!

3399
02:29:49,250 --> 02:29:51,110
I'm in the movie!

3400
02:29:51,830 --> 02:29:53,750
Did you stay up all night?

3401
02:29:54,030 --> 02:29:55,410
Oh, it just plays it again and again.

3402
02:29:57,270 --> 02:29:57,950
That's me!

3403
02:29:58,430 --> 02:29:59,070
Oh, that's Fiona!

3404
02:30:00,210 --> 02:30:01,730
I'm in the movie, guys!

3405
02:30:11,100 --> 02:30:13,000
The outside is dangerous.

3406
02:30:16,920 --> 02:30:18,720
I don't wanna go outside.

3407
02:30:25,740 --> 02:30:26,220
Wait!

3408
02:30:26,580 --> 02:30:26,720
Oh!

3409
02:30:32,110 --> 02:30:33,270
Did I miss a number?

3410
02:30:35,670 --> 02:30:37,010
Was there a number in here?

3411
02:30:44,220 --> 02:30:45,700
I didn't see a number.

3412
02:30:45,940 --> 02:30:46,840
I'm exhausted.

3413
02:30:47,160 --> 02:30:48,860
So much to do by morning.

3414
02:30:49,340 --> 02:30:51,700
I'll never be ready for my big presentation.

3415
02:30:53,020 --> 02:30:54,640
All I wanna do is sleep.

3416
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:54,920
I think so.

3417
02:30:55,140 --> 02:30:55,960
I didn't see a number.

3418
02:30:56,360 --> 02:30:59,100
Why sleep when you can stay up latte?

3419
02:30:59,380 --> 02:31:00,780
Wait, there was a number in there?

3420
02:31:01,140 --> 02:31:01,520
Stay up late?

3421
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:02,200
No.

3422
02:31:03,160 --> 02:31:03,600
Latte.

3423
02:31:03,620 --> 02:31:04,820
Wait, I gotta see this number.

3424
02:31:05,020 --> 02:31:05,440
Sorry, guys.

3425
02:31:05,540 --> 02:31:06,280
I'm re-watching it.

3426
02:31:06,340 --> 02:31:07,680
I wanna know what I missed.

3427
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:08,000
Mmm.

3428
02:31:10,340 --> 02:31:11,260
Distinctive taste.

3429
02:31:11,780 --> 02:31:13,560
Rich and roasted, yet creamy.

3430
02:31:13,560 --> 02:31:14,300
What was the number?

3431
02:31:15,100 --> 02:31:16,840
Oh, you guys got the number for me?

3432
02:31:17,780 --> 02:31:21,580
I was too busy looking at my- My first movie appearance.

3433
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:22,380
Right here.

3434
02:31:22,540 --> 02:31:25,080
This is my first- The first time I ever appeared.

3435
02:31:25,320 --> 02:31:26,260
In a film.

3436
02:31:26,260 --> 02:31:29,600
I know what you want better than you do.

3437
02:31:30,040 --> 02:31:31,380
I am always watching.

3438
02:31:31,720 --> 02:31:32,620
Watching and learning.

3439
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:34,040
Have another cup.

3440
02:31:34,160 --> 02:31:35,340
Have another cup.

3441
02:31:35,720 --> 02:31:36,560
Have another cup.

3442
02:31:37,140 --> 02:31:37,540
Have another cup.

3443
02:31:37,540 --> 02:31:37,600
Have another cup.

3444
02:31:37,600 --> 02:31:37,840
Another cup.

3445
02:31:39,020 --> 02:31:40,720
Did you stay up all night?

3446
02:31:41,180 --> 02:31:41,620
No.

3447
02:31:42,460 --> 02:31:44,040
I stayed up latte.

3448
02:31:44,820 --> 02:31:45,000
Attay.

3449
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:46,840
After two full bars, I'm ready to work.

3450
02:31:46,980 --> 02:31:47,520
Promotion?

3451
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:48,360
Here I come!

3452
02:31:50,180 --> 02:31:51,600
That's the merdipment.

3453
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:51,940
Yeah!

3454
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:57,280
What the fuck was the number?

3455
02:31:57,960 --> 02:31:59,840
Alright, I trust you guys got the number.

3456
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:04,880
Oh hey, there's another collectible.

3457
02:32:06,500 --> 02:32:07,500
You got mail!

3458
02:32:17,190 --> 02:32:18,690
Got another collectible!

3459
02:32:22,420 --> 02:32:23,940
Oh, it doesn't come until later?

3460
02:32:24,100 --> 02:32:25,420
I fucking knew you guys were gaslighting.

3461
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:33,580
That chat, is this real?

3462
02:32:35,240 --> 02:32:36,720
Alright, left or right?

3463
02:32:39,340 --> 02:32:40,840
Guys, left or right?

3464
02:32:43,580 --> 02:32:47,720
Right side, there's a bee that told me to go outside and touch grass, so I don't know.

3465
02:32:51,940 --> 02:32:53,500
Right is more scary.

3466
02:32:53,740 --> 02:32:54,700
Okay, I'm going left.

3467
02:32:59,140 --> 02:33:00,500
Wait, do I have it?

3468
02:33:00,660 --> 02:33:01,600
Oh fuck.

3469
02:33:02,500 --> 02:33:04,100
I guess I go right.

3470
02:33:11,510 --> 02:33:12,630
Never mind.

3471
02:33:13,910 --> 02:33:16,770
We go to the room that's more scary.

3472
02:33:24,670 --> 02:33:25,350
I

3473
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:29,600
just...

3474
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:33,000
I guess...

3475
02:33:34,840 --> 02:33:35,120
What?

3476
02:33:43,050 --> 02:33:43,770
What?

3477
02:33:49,500 --> 02:33:50,220
Hello?

3478
02:33:55,300 --> 02:33:55,640
Hello?

3479
02:33:58,460 --> 02:33:59,180
Hello?

3480
02:33:59,180 --> 02:33:59,580
Mail time?

3481
02:34:08,110 --> 02:34:09,690
Alright, we go this way.

3482
02:34:10,550 --> 02:34:12,750
Everything looks so fine, guys.

3483
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:14,750
It's so fine and healthy.

3484
02:34:14,750 --> 02:34:14,970
Let's see.

3485
02:34:17,590 --> 02:34:18,850
Alright, we go through here.

3486
02:34:21,010 --> 02:34:23,630
Yeah, it does look like I gotta run soon.

3487
02:34:24,510 --> 02:34:26,650
I think this is like the loading section.

3488
02:34:26,910 --> 02:34:28,890
Because they're loading the next place.

3489
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:34,720
Oh guys, remember that code?

3490
02:34:36,300 --> 02:34:38,180
From like 80 years ago?

3491
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:41,160
This is your moment, guys!

3492
02:34:41,620 --> 02:34:42,370
It's the code!

3493
02:34:43,540 --> 02:34:44,580
Right here!

3494
02:34:45,180 --> 02:34:46,460
That one code!

3495
02:34:46,780 --> 02:34:47,960
It's not boob, I know.

3496
02:34:48,180 --> 02:34:48,800
At chat!

3497
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:51,100
That's the first code we saw!

3498
02:34:51,960 --> 02:34:52,480
What do you mean?

3499
02:34:52,700 --> 02:34:53,080
It's the...

3500
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:54,120
Okay, four...

3501
02:34:54,120 --> 02:34:55,180
Four...

3502
02:34:56,320 --> 02:34:56,980
Two...

3503
02:34:58,080 --> 02:34:58,740
Three...

3504
02:35:00,100 --> 02:35:02,160
Okay, it's five numbers.

3505
02:35:03,620 --> 02:35:04,380
Two...

3506
02:35:05,300 --> 02:35:06,060
Two...

3507
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:07,460
Six...

3508
02:35:08,580 --> 02:35:09,340
Two...

3509
02:35:10,160 --> 02:35:10,620
Nine...

3510
02:35:11,160 --> 02:35:11,580
Four...

3511
02:35:11,580 --> 02:35:12,320
There we go.

3512
02:35:14,020 --> 02:35:15,880
The first code we ever saw.

3513
02:35:16,980 --> 02:35:18,840
We finally gotta use it.

3514
02:35:23,960 --> 02:35:25,000
Wait, there's another...

3515
02:35:25,820 --> 02:35:28,200
I knew you guys could remember it.

3516
02:35:28,480 --> 02:35:30,280
I've always believed in you.

3517
02:35:32,380 --> 02:35:34,960
That's why I never remember it myself.

3518
02:35:39,630 --> 02:35:42,050
Okay, so this is the employee's room.

3519
02:35:43,030 --> 02:35:46,190
Everybody really fucking loves Freddy Fazbear Pizzeria.

3520
02:35:52,380 --> 02:35:53,660
Aw, man.

3521
02:35:55,420 --> 02:35:56,760
Aw, man.

3522
02:36:00,420 --> 02:36:02,020
Is there like...

3523
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:03,860
An area closer?

3524
02:36:04,420 --> 02:36:05,640
For me to store this?

3525
02:36:07,020 --> 02:36:07,780
Aw...

3526
02:36:11,700 --> 02:36:13,840
Yeah, but I wanna get the collectible too.

3527
02:36:18,300 --> 02:36:19,840
Did I come back to it?

3528
02:36:22,740 --> 02:36:24,320
Where the fuck is the...

3529
02:36:27,070 --> 02:36:28,240
Gonna chuck that here.

3530
02:36:30,700 --> 02:36:31,780
And then...

3531
02:36:32,440 --> 02:36:33,520
Grab this.

3532
02:36:39,750 --> 02:36:41,990
And then I got a lunchbox now.

3533
02:36:50,480 --> 02:36:51,020
Wait...

3534
02:36:54,980 --> 02:36:56,740
From where I have the door.

3535
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,400
There's no way she'll come for me in the bathroom.

3536
02:37:07,680 --> 02:37:08,160
Oh...

3537
02:37:10,100 --> 02:37:10,580
Oh...

3538
02:37:14,370 --> 02:37:15,750
I don't like this.

3539
02:37:16,530 --> 02:37:18,270
Feels like she wants to...

3540
02:37:18,270 --> 02:37:19,810
Come into the bathroom.

3541
02:37:23,980 --> 02:37:25,000
Alright, what does this...

3542
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:26,000
What do the crack do?

3543
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:32,080
Where did I put my film?

3544
02:37:32,660 --> 02:37:34,400
Oh my god, it chucked too many.

3545
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:36,000
I can't see.

3546
02:37:37,940 --> 02:37:39,660
Oh my god, where did I put it?

3547
02:37:40,060 --> 02:37:42,280
Oh my god, I lost the film!

3548
02:37:54,040 --> 02:37:55,120
We hit it!

3549
02:37:58,410 --> 02:38:00,850
Oh no, I juggled it too much, guys.

3550
02:38:01,130 --> 02:38:03,430
I juggled the film too much!

3551
02:38:04,430 --> 02:38:04,930
Oh!

3552
02:38:08,890 --> 02:38:10,130
It actually disappeared!

3553
02:38:10,990 --> 02:38:11,410
It...

3554
02:38:11,410 --> 02:38:12,450
It's gone!

3555
02:38:14,670 --> 02:38:15,510
What?

3556
02:38:18,290 --> 02:38:20,430
But we got the connectable!

3557
02:38:27,010 --> 02:38:28,630
What happened to it?

3558
02:38:29,150 --> 02:38:30,370
Where did it go?

3559
02:38:36,070 --> 02:38:37,950
Can it be back in the save?

3560
02:38:38,450 --> 02:38:39,710
Can it do that?

3561
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:48,920
I don't like that.

3562
02:38:50,140 --> 02:38:50,420
No.

3563
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:51,480
Oh.

3564
02:38:51,940 --> 02:38:52,380
Oh.

3565
02:39:01,310 --> 02:39:02,510
It actually...

3566
02:39:02,510 --> 02:39:03,950
It disappeared!

3567
02:39:05,350 --> 02:39:05,950
It's...

3568
02:39:05,950 --> 02:39:07,850
Okay, let's turn up the brightness.

3569
02:39:08,230 --> 02:39:10,410
I need to know what happened to it.

3570
02:39:10,810 --> 02:39:11,610
Alright, don't worry.

3571
02:39:11,730 --> 02:39:12,070
I'll...

3572
02:39:12,070 --> 02:39:13,090
I'll lower it back.

3573
02:39:13,190 --> 02:39:14,170
I'll lower it back.

3574
02:39:14,490 --> 02:39:15,090
I...

3575
02:39:15,090 --> 02:39:16,490
I cannot see.

3576
02:39:17,350 --> 02:39:21,910
I tried to do something cool and juggle it, but it didn't work.

3577
02:39:24,030 --> 02:39:24,590
Oops.

3578
02:39:26,790 --> 02:39:28,490
Okay, I'm just trying...

3579
02:39:29,150 --> 02:39:30,230
Oh my god!

3580
02:39:30,390 --> 02:39:32,090
Wait, what if I play the game like this?

3581
02:39:32,250 --> 02:39:34,330
Wait, it's actually gone!

3582
02:39:35,190 --> 02:39:35,370
Wait!

3583
02:39:36,390 --> 02:39:38,750
Wait, it's actually gone!

3584
02:39:39,210 --> 02:39:39,570
Wait!

3585
02:39:40,610 --> 02:39:40,950
It's...

3586
02:39:40,950 --> 02:39:42,690
And this game is less scary though.

3587
02:39:45,590 --> 02:39:46,630
Oh my god!

3588
02:39:53,140 --> 02:39:55,400
No, I don't think it's in the bathroom.

3589
02:39:55,680 --> 02:39:57,160
I think it actually...

3590
02:39:57,160 --> 02:39:58,140
It's gone, gone.

3591
02:39:58,140 --> 02:39:58,980
It's...

3592
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:00,380
It's...

3593
02:40:00,380 --> 02:40:00,600
It's gone!

3594
02:40:02,260 --> 02:40:02,800
Okay.

3595
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:04,740
Guys, we have to die!

3596
02:40:05,780 --> 02:40:07,820
We actually have to die!

3597
02:40:08,500 --> 02:40:08,840
It...

3598
02:40:09,480 --> 02:40:11,080
Wait, it's next to the trash bag?

3599
02:40:11,220 --> 02:40:12,060
Where is it?

3600
02:40:14,480 --> 02:40:15,460
Where is it?

3601
02:40:15,920 --> 02:40:17,040
Did you guys see it?

3602
02:40:17,900 --> 02:40:18,920
Did you see it?

3603
02:40:24,400 --> 02:40:24,940
Wait...

3604
02:40:24,940 --> 02:40:26,400
I'm next to the trash bag.

3605
02:40:26,400 --> 02:40:30,560
I'm next to the trash bag.

3606
02:40:31,660 --> 02:40:32,760
Where is it?

3607
02:40:33,640 --> 02:40:34,860
I can't believe it!

3608
02:40:36,040 --> 02:40:36,620
I...

3609
02:40:36,620 --> 02:40:37,860
I got what...

3610
02:40:37,860 --> 02:40:38,700
Oh my god!

3611
02:40:39,160 --> 02:40:40,380
Oh my god!

3612
02:40:40,600 --> 02:40:41,860
Even dad's angry!

3613
02:40:41,860 --> 02:40:42,380
He's like...

3614
02:40:42,380 --> 02:40:43,820
How could you lose it?

3615
02:40:44,080 --> 02:40:45,740
How did you lose it?

3616
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:46,840
Oh my god!

3617
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:48,480
And the thing was right there!

3618
02:40:48,720 --> 02:40:50,600
It was right there!

3619
02:40:59,920 --> 02:41:00,940
Can we...

3620
02:41:00,940 --> 02:41:01,400
We...

3621
02:41:01,400 --> 02:41:02,000
We...

3622
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:02,840
We actually...

3623
02:41:02,840 --> 02:41:04,540
We have to reload...

3624
02:41:04,540 --> 02:41:05,120
We...

3625
02:41:05,120 --> 02:41:05,880
We...

3626
02:41:05,880 --> 02:41:06,280
Wait...

3627
02:41:06,280 --> 02:41:06,480
We...

3628
02:41:07,500 --> 02:41:08,020
Wait...

3629
02:41:08,800 --> 02:41:10,680
Okay, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

3630
02:41:11,060 --> 02:41:12,860
Maybe he'll kill me before...

3631
02:41:12,860 --> 02:41:12,980
What?

3632
02:41:13,080 --> 02:41:13,940
Before I come back.

3633
02:41:14,100 --> 02:41:14,720
I'll be right back.

3634
02:42:25,500 --> 02:42:26,420
I'm back.

3635
02:42:26,460 --> 02:42:27,100
I'm back.

3636
02:42:27,100 --> 02:42:27,820
Where is she?

3637
02:42:28,260 --> 02:42:29,880
Can she just kill me?

3638
02:42:30,680 --> 02:42:31,420
Oh my...

3639
02:42:31,420 --> 02:42:32,020
Just kill me!

3640
02:42:32,280 --> 02:42:32,700
Just...

3641
02:42:32,700 --> 02:42:35,200
Put me out of my misery!

3642
02:42:35,700 --> 02:42:36,220
Okay, guys.

3643
02:42:36,360 --> 02:42:37,540
We have to reload this.

3644
02:42:38,020 --> 02:42:38,480
We...

3645
02:42:38,480 --> 02:42:41,340
We actually have to reload it.

3646
02:42:41,340 --> 02:42:42,160
I...

3647
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:43,280
Cause I...

3648
02:42:43,280 --> 02:42:44,560
Cause like...

3649
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:46,520
I don't know where the fuck the film went.

3650
02:42:46,780 --> 02:42:48,600
It actually like...

3651
02:42:48,600 --> 02:42:49,260
Disappeared.

3652
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:51,440
Oh!

3653
02:42:51,620 --> 02:42:52,400
Oh my god!

3654
02:42:52,480 --> 02:42:54,020
I thought I had to go back from the beginning.

3655
02:42:54,360 --> 02:42:55,340
Oh my god!

3656
02:42:55,480 --> 02:42:57,280
I thought they put me back in the car.

3657
02:42:57,980 --> 02:42:58,460
I...

3658
02:43:00,320 --> 02:43:01,200
What happened?

3659
02:43:01,440 --> 02:43:03,100
I lost the film!

3660
02:43:06,640 --> 02:43:07,460
Oh my god!

3661
02:43:07,580 --> 02:43:09,420
This game is a lot less scary now.

3662
02:43:11,880 --> 02:43:12,320
Okay.

3663
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:14,040
Uh...

3664
02:43:14,660 --> 02:43:15,100
Graphics.

3665
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:16,440
Uh...

3666
02:43:16,440 --> 02:43:17,280
Brightness.

3667
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:18,700
Nah, I wanna play it.

3668
02:43:18,800 --> 02:43:20,360
What if I just play it at...

3669
02:43:20,360 --> 02:43:21,460
At that brightness?

3670
02:43:24,600 --> 02:43:25,040
Wow!

3671
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:29,080
Wait, where did I go?

3672
02:43:29,340 --> 02:43:30,280
I don't even remember.

3673
02:43:31,140 --> 02:43:32,320
Which way did I went?

3674
02:43:33,880 --> 02:43:35,000
Did I get the mail yet?

3675
02:43:40,220 --> 02:43:41,160
It's here, right?

3676
02:43:41,460 --> 02:43:42,120
Oh my god!

3677
02:43:42,180 --> 02:43:43,220
I don't remember where...

3678
02:43:43,220 --> 02:43:43,720
Where I went.

3679
02:43:44,340 --> 02:43:44,420
Ah!

3680
02:43:44,660 --> 02:43:45,660
Fucking everything...

3681
02:43:45,660 --> 02:43:47,000
Is blurring together.

3682
02:43:47,340 --> 02:43:48,320
Okay, I went through here.

3683
02:43:48,860 --> 02:43:50,420
And then...

3684
02:43:50,420 --> 02:43:51,540
The cell phone.

3685
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:52,000
Yeah.

3686
02:44:01,020 --> 02:44:01,620
Alright.

3687
02:44:02,140 --> 02:44:02,740
Unlock.

3688
02:44:06,440 --> 02:44:07,720
Okay, what was the...

3689
02:44:07,720 --> 02:44:09,600
What was the silly number again, guys?

3690
02:44:13,530 --> 02:44:14,130
Guys.

3691
02:44:14,730 --> 02:44:15,330
Come on.

3692
02:44:15,630 --> 02:44:17,350
I know you guys know this number.

3693
02:44:17,730 --> 02:44:19,130
Guys, it's not boobs.

3694
02:44:19,130 --> 02:44:19,270
Boobs.

3695
02:44:20,110 --> 02:44:21,630
One day it will be boobs.

3696
02:44:21,770 --> 02:44:23,050
But today is not that day.

3697
02:44:23,890 --> 02:44:24,950
Two, six, two, nine, four.

3698
02:44:25,710 --> 02:44:26,130
Two...

3699
02:44:26,130 --> 02:44:26,270
Two...

3700
02:44:26,270 --> 02:44:26,970
Six...

3701
02:44:28,030 --> 02:44:28,450
Two...

3702
02:44:29,470 --> 02:44:29,890
Nine...

3703
02:44:29,890 --> 02:44:30,290
Four.

3704
02:44:30,490 --> 02:44:32,010
One day it will be that day.

3705
02:44:32,310 --> 02:44:33,130
But it's not today.

3706
02:44:36,210 --> 02:44:38,150
Doki boobs is not silly.

3707
02:44:40,130 --> 02:44:40,790
Alright.

3708
02:44:41,410 --> 02:44:41,730
Alright.

3709
02:44:42,110 --> 02:44:42,610
This time.

3710
02:44:44,530 --> 02:44:45,450
This time.

3711
02:44:45,670 --> 02:44:46,230
We got it.

3712
02:44:51,600 --> 02:44:53,200
It's time we got it.

3713
02:44:53,820 --> 02:44:55,340
For God, it's not just a quick swipe.

3714
02:44:59,290 --> 02:45:01,970
Wait, can I put the film in the storage?

3715
02:45:02,610 --> 02:45:03,850
Am I allowed to?

3716
02:45:05,590 --> 02:45:06,650
Oh, yes, I can.

3717
02:45:06,810 --> 02:45:07,310
Oh, thank God.

3718
02:45:08,130 --> 02:45:08,590
That's good.

3719
02:45:10,930 --> 02:45:12,830
Okay, I didn't break it this time, chat.

3720
02:45:13,590 --> 02:45:16,730
The film did not fucking evaporate it under the floor.

3721
02:45:20,760 --> 02:45:23,220
I think I broke this game like eight times.

3722
02:45:26,320 --> 02:45:27,340
Alright, nice.

3723
02:45:30,400 --> 02:45:31,720
Oh, that's the elevator.

3724
02:45:32,120 --> 02:45:32,800
Wait, where do I go?

3725
02:45:33,800 --> 02:45:35,020
At chat, I'm lost.

3726
02:45:36,660 --> 02:45:38,460
I don't recognize this place.

3727
02:45:40,420 --> 02:45:41,040
Returns?

3728
02:45:41,160 --> 02:45:42,020
Do I have that?

3729
02:45:42,580 --> 02:45:43,200
No.

3730
02:45:44,580 --> 02:45:45,620
I'm lost.

3731
02:45:52,370 --> 02:45:53,490
I don't know.

3732
02:45:54,990 --> 02:45:56,050
Thank you, guys.

3733
02:45:56,050 --> 02:45:57,050
Oh, it's the...

3734
02:45:58,110 --> 02:45:59,490
Where the fuck am I?

3735
02:45:59,550 --> 02:46:00,310
Oh, wait, it's here.

3736
02:46:00,470 --> 02:46:01,150
I'm back here.

3737
02:46:02,950 --> 02:46:06,030
Wait, why is the light glowing on this particular area?

3738
02:46:08,550 --> 02:46:09,610
Do I have this?

3739
02:46:09,870 --> 02:46:10,350
No.

3740
02:46:11,570 --> 02:46:13,310
Where do I...

3741
02:46:16,730 --> 02:46:18,810
No, there's nothing on the forklift.

3742
02:46:19,950 --> 02:46:22,690
I mean, can I access the forklift?

3743
02:46:22,790 --> 02:46:24,270
Can I push the forklift?

3744
02:46:25,630 --> 02:46:27,350
There's a door here.

3745
02:46:34,920 --> 02:46:36,220
Here, workshop?

3746
02:46:36,800 --> 02:46:37,200
Here?

3747
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:43,520
I'm back here.

3748
02:46:44,440 --> 02:46:46,700
Oh my god, I'm not forklift certified.

3749
02:46:47,500 --> 02:46:49,320
I need to get certified first.

3750
02:46:52,340 --> 02:46:53,800
I'm back in the workshop.

3751
02:46:56,580 --> 02:46:57,040
Theater?

3752
02:46:57,260 --> 02:46:58,380
No, I came from a theater.

3753
02:47:04,630 --> 02:47:06,210
Yeah, I came from a theater.

3754
02:47:07,190 --> 02:47:07,930
Wait, no.

3755
02:47:08,410 --> 02:47:09,390
There's two theaters?

3756
02:47:10,170 --> 02:47:11,950
Wait, where did I come from?

3757
02:47:11,950 --> 02:47:12,970
Where...

3758
02:47:18,050 --> 02:47:22,060
I'm so lost.

3759
02:47:22,440 --> 02:47:24,900
Oh, maybe here.

3760
02:47:28,060 --> 02:47:28,340
Oh.

3761
02:47:30,080 --> 02:47:30,640
Okay.

3762
02:47:31,580 --> 02:47:32,480
Oh, this is where...

3763
02:47:32,480 --> 02:47:33,300
Oh, I know this!

3764
02:47:33,480 --> 02:47:35,000
This is where they make the animatronics.

3765
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:39,060
See, that's where they construct it.

3766
02:47:39,960 --> 02:47:40,800
Hey, Arnold.

3767
02:47:41,120 --> 02:47:44,300
The system says you need a suit to get into the theater.

3768
02:47:44,300 --> 02:47:46,060
Alright, put it in me.

3769
02:47:48,060 --> 02:47:49,500
I saw dead by daylight.

3770
02:47:49,880 --> 02:47:51,260
He seemed so fine.

3771
02:47:54,240 --> 02:47:56,280
He seemed mentally okay.

3772
02:48:00,630 --> 02:48:01,270
Uh...

3773
02:48:01,270 --> 02:48:02,150
Start assembly.

3774
02:48:10,520 --> 02:48:10,840
Alright.

3775
02:48:16,200 --> 02:48:17,000
That's it.

3776
02:48:18,360 --> 02:48:19,500
Pieces of updated...

3777
02:48:20,300 --> 02:48:20,920
Can we found...

3778
02:48:20,920 --> 02:48:22,780
Oh, I have to find the pieces of it.

3779
02:48:24,040 --> 02:48:24,680
Okay.

3780
02:48:27,780 --> 02:48:31,120
I like listening to her talk to me as if I'm a regular person.

3781
02:48:31,280 --> 02:48:32,400
Welcome to our more famous costume workshop.

3782
02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:38,260
If you are not an MCM employee, please proceed to...

3783
02:48:38,260 --> 02:48:39,300
Joke's on you!

3784
02:48:39,520 --> 02:48:40,640
I am!

3785
02:48:41,560 --> 02:48:46,140
Backstage theater access is restricted to potential plants and demonstration...

3786
02:48:46,140 --> 02:48:47,360
I got promotion!

3787
02:48:48,040 --> 02:48:50,320
Spring lock assembly may be required.

3788
02:48:51,140 --> 02:48:51,780
Oh.

3789
02:48:51,780 --> 02:48:56,560
Please ensure there are no hazards that could cause issues.

3790
02:48:56,840 --> 02:48:58,120
Oh, that's freaky.

3791
02:48:58,360 --> 02:49:03,460
Mr. Helpful is worried about the effects of moisture on the suit's functionality and safety.

3792
02:49:03,960 --> 02:49:05,460
Wait, what's this access, though?

3793
02:49:06,540 --> 02:49:07,420
What is this getting me?

3794
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:10,060
Yeah, she said the word, guys!

3795
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:11,200
She said spring lock!

3796
02:49:15,740 --> 02:49:16,380
Ah!

3797
02:49:16,380 --> 02:49:16,500
Okay.

3798
02:49:17,600 --> 02:49:18,560
Boy, spring lock's bad.

3799
02:49:18,900 --> 02:49:19,800
Doesn't that crush me?

3800
02:49:20,180 --> 02:49:22,000
Use the costume lift to access the theater booth.

3801
02:49:23,420 --> 02:49:26,740
It won't operate unless you're wearing the suit.

3802
02:49:26,740 --> 02:49:27,240
Okay.

3803
02:49:28,900 --> 02:49:34,100
Once you're in place, the stage manager program will guide you through the demonstration.

3804
02:49:36,280 --> 02:49:37,240
Good luck!

3805
02:49:37,640 --> 02:49:40,040
Oh, I mean, break a leg.

3806
02:49:40,420 --> 02:49:40,960
Sorry!

3807
02:49:41,540 --> 02:49:42,880
Oh, there's another recording.

3808
02:49:43,980 --> 02:49:46,320
David, I want to introduce you to someone.

3809
02:49:46,920 --> 02:49:47,960
This is M1.

3810
02:49:48,600 --> 02:49:49,100
M1?

3811
02:49:49,100 --> 02:49:50,720
Why does it look like that?

3812
02:49:50,940 --> 02:49:51,400
M1?

3813
02:49:52,180 --> 02:49:52,240
M1?

3814
02:49:52,500 --> 02:49:53,420
It's scary.

3815
02:49:54,100 --> 02:49:56,060
Okay, everything your dad made is scary.

3816
02:49:58,260 --> 02:49:59,780
It'll wear fun costumes.

3817
02:50:00,940 --> 02:50:01,500
M1?

3818
02:50:02,020 --> 02:50:05,300
David, everything your dad makes is a fucking freak show.

3819
02:50:06,160 --> 02:50:07,580
Think of it as your new babysitter.

3820
02:50:07,920 --> 02:50:11,660
But if it doesn't get paid and go home, it'll stay with us.

3821
02:50:11,760 --> 02:50:12,920
And help around the house.

3822
02:50:15,520 --> 02:50:16,080
Okay.

3823
02:50:16,080 --> 02:50:17,520
Oh, so that was the Mic Mic.

3824
02:50:17,700 --> 02:50:19,360
It's like an unpaid babysitter.

3825
02:50:20,840 --> 02:50:23,760
But that's still more expensive than a regular babysitter.

3826
02:50:23,820 --> 02:50:26,840
Because that shit must have cost thousands of dollars.

3827
02:50:26,900 --> 02:50:28,080
When you can just pay...

3828
02:50:28,080 --> 02:50:30,080
And a teenager...

3829
02:50:30,940 --> 02:50:32,480
Like, below minimum wage.

3830
02:50:34,520 --> 02:50:34,960
Alright.

3831
02:50:35,380 --> 02:50:36,840
Ralph went to the hospital last night.

3832
02:50:36,980 --> 02:50:39,180
That suit is going to be the death of one of us.

3833
02:50:39,460 --> 02:50:40,900
One more injury and I'm...

3834
02:50:40,900 --> 02:50:42,140
And I'm out of here.

3835
02:50:42,280 --> 02:50:43,420
I mean it this time.

3836
02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:44,800
I know, I know.

3837
02:50:44,800 --> 02:50:46,640
I don't think it's that big of a problem.

3838
02:50:46,940 --> 02:50:50,620
The misspelling actually helps us when it comes to possible copyright issues.

3839
02:50:50,880 --> 02:50:52,940
The double L spelling protects us.

3840
02:50:53,320 --> 02:50:54,800
Nobody will notice anyway.

3841
02:50:56,480 --> 02:50:59,040
Ed, how many times did I tell you this?

3842
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:00,160
Uh...

3843
02:51:00,160 --> 02:51:03,580
Mycelium only has one L.

3844
02:51:03,840 --> 02:51:06,460
Now all the marking images are misspelled.

3845
02:51:06,680 --> 02:51:10,460
Our clients are going to think we make mistakes and don't pay attention to the details.

3846
02:51:10,460 --> 02:51:12,780
Is there any way on how to fix it?

3847
02:51:14,720 --> 02:51:16,200
Guys, it's copyright law.

3848
02:51:17,460 --> 02:51:21,660
It's like how someone can name themselves Doko Bird and then like I can't do shit about it.

3849
02:51:24,060 --> 02:51:26,040
Oh my god, is that Doko Bird?

3850
02:51:28,180 --> 02:51:28,940
Doko Bird?

3851
02:51:28,940 --> 02:51:29,120
Okay.

3852
02:51:30,880 --> 02:51:32,980
I need to find the head.

3853
02:51:33,720 --> 02:51:35,380
Can I just wear these guys?

3854
02:51:37,880 --> 02:51:38,680
Doko Bird.

3855
02:51:39,660 --> 02:51:40,900
I have Doko Bird.

3856
02:51:40,900 --> 02:51:41,380
Oh god.

3857
02:51:41,700 --> 02:51:42,580
Oh hey there.

3858
02:51:45,840 --> 02:51:46,920
Let me pet you.

3859
02:51:47,280 --> 02:51:48,880
I wanna touch your head.

3860
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:51,580
Come on, let me touch your head.

3861
02:51:52,440 --> 02:51:53,700
Come on little guy.

3862
02:51:54,740 --> 02:51:55,800
Oh my god.

3863
02:51:55,960 --> 02:51:56,860
Let me touch your head.

3864
02:51:56,980 --> 02:51:57,380
There he is.

3865
02:51:57,520 --> 02:51:58,080
Good boy.

3866
02:51:58,740 --> 02:52:00,040
Who's a good boy?

3867
02:52:01,660 --> 02:52:02,360
There you go.

3868
02:52:02,440 --> 02:52:03,500
He let me touch his head.

3869
02:52:05,100 --> 02:52:09,220
Where do I find the rest of this fucking suit?

3870
02:52:11,300 --> 02:52:12,360
Hey Arnold.

3871
02:52:12,640 --> 02:52:15,860
The system says you need a suit to get into the theater.

3872
02:52:17,900 --> 02:52:19,480
Oh, I have to go out now?

3873
02:52:19,840 --> 02:52:20,600
Oh no.

3874
02:52:28,540 --> 02:52:29,100
What?

3875
02:52:29,400 --> 02:52:30,380
There's nothing up here.

3876
02:52:36,850 --> 02:52:37,710
Where are you?

3877
02:52:54,990 --> 02:52:57,010
Oh my god, that's a leg.

3878
02:53:14,160 --> 02:53:16,860
Where do I go through so loud?

3879
02:53:23,220 --> 02:53:25,080
I don't know where I am.

3880
02:53:29,440 --> 02:53:31,120
Oh my god, there's the other leg.

3881
02:53:31,340 --> 02:53:35,100
I found the other leg though.

3882
02:53:37,400 --> 02:53:40,340
Guys, do you think it's gonna clip through again?

3883
02:53:43,960 --> 02:53:45,300
I have two legs.

3884
02:53:52,320 --> 02:53:52,760
Alright.

3885
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:55,200
Okay, I got a leg.

3886
02:53:57,200 --> 02:53:57,640
Alright.

3887
02:53:58,220 --> 02:54:00,220
I got one of the legs.

3888
02:54:06,410 --> 02:54:07,310
Where's my other leg?

3889
02:54:07,410 --> 02:54:08,310
Okay, there's the other leg.

3890
02:54:09,390 --> 02:54:09,770
Oh!

3891
02:54:14,670 --> 02:54:16,850
He just gets a TP like that?

3892
02:54:17,650 --> 02:54:19,930
Oh my god, I hope my leg is still on that floor.

3893
02:54:20,110 --> 02:54:22,390
I hope my leg is still on this plane of existence.

3894
02:54:25,490 --> 02:54:31,990
I hope it's still on this plane of existence in this 3D floor right in front of me.

3895
02:54:33,910 --> 02:54:34,510
Okay.

3896
02:54:35,370 --> 02:54:36,770
Oh my god, it is.

3897
02:54:37,250 --> 02:54:37,830
Oh, thank god.

3898
02:54:39,070 --> 02:54:41,190
I'm glad it didn't noclip.

3899
02:54:41,490 --> 02:54:42,690
That's all I wanted.

3900
02:54:43,810 --> 02:54:46,090
I only want one thing.

3901
02:54:46,250 --> 02:54:48,510
To make sure this shit does a noclip.

3902
02:54:53,790 --> 02:54:56,530
Okay, now I need to figure out where the fuck the head is.

3903
02:54:57,370 --> 02:54:57,710
No head?

3904
02:55:05,560 --> 02:55:06,580
The fuck is that head?

3905
02:55:07,640 --> 02:55:08,920
Oh wait, mail time though.

3906
02:55:09,180 --> 02:55:10,420
Mail is always important.

3907
02:55:12,700 --> 02:55:13,580
Mail time.

3908
02:55:15,500 --> 02:55:17,500
We just got a letter.

3909
02:55:17,760 --> 02:55:19,460
We just got a letter.

3910
02:55:19,900 --> 02:55:22,060
Wonder who it would be.

3911
02:55:23,380 --> 02:55:24,280
Is that the head?

3912
02:55:25,200 --> 02:55:28,070
Oh my god.

3913
02:55:28,530 --> 02:55:30,390
Oh my god.

3914
02:55:31,050 --> 02:55:31,630
There you go.

3915
02:55:32,170 --> 02:55:32,510
It's fine.

3916
02:55:33,230 --> 02:55:34,670
We have to lower the head down.

3917
02:55:41,710 --> 02:55:42,350
Okay.

3918
02:55:43,770 --> 02:55:44,730
We're fine.

3919
02:55:49,830 --> 02:55:50,890
It's so fast.

3920
02:55:51,110 --> 02:55:51,310
Please.

3921
02:55:52,010 --> 02:55:52,630
Go downstairs.

3922
02:55:53,790 --> 02:55:54,750
Is that mushroom?

3923
02:55:55,010 --> 02:55:55,990
I don't know what's in it.

3924
02:55:56,830 --> 02:55:57,850
What if I just like...

3925
02:55:59,150 --> 02:56:00,390
There's like no eye.

3926
02:56:00,890 --> 02:56:01,670
Oh my god.

3927
02:56:02,170 --> 02:56:02,930
It's so freaky.

3928
02:56:03,770 --> 02:56:05,510
A freaky little guy.

3929
02:56:06,370 --> 02:56:06,750
Okay.

3930
02:56:06,830 --> 02:56:07,590
Not gonna lie.

3931
02:56:07,850 --> 02:56:09,550
If they can make animatronics like this.

3932
02:56:09,850 --> 02:56:10,170
Like...

3933
02:56:10,170 --> 02:56:11,850
They should sell that to the government.

3934
02:56:12,090 --> 02:56:14,190
Like you can fucking build a terminator at that point.

3935
02:56:14,270 --> 02:56:17,230
And we're using it to build killed kids animatronics.

3936
02:56:17,610 --> 02:56:19,470
Like send that guy out to war.

3937
02:56:19,730 --> 02:56:20,790
Oh my god.

3938
02:56:25,350 --> 02:56:28,930
United States using an army of FNAF animatronics.

3939
02:56:29,950 --> 02:56:32,630
Like that's literally Terminator right there.

3940
02:56:35,210 --> 02:56:37,290
Why the fuck are we using...

3941
02:56:37,290 --> 02:56:40,930
Why is the US government not using this technology?

3942
02:56:41,590 --> 02:56:42,930
Deploying Freddy Fazbear.

3943
02:56:44,850 --> 02:56:45,530
Sir.

3944
02:56:47,070 --> 02:56:48,930
Sir, we gotta deploy him.

3945
02:56:49,150 --> 02:56:50,490
But he's not ready yet.

3946
02:56:58,420 --> 02:56:59,100
Whoops.

3947
02:57:00,720 --> 02:57:01,780
He heard that?

3948
02:57:09,500 --> 02:57:12,400
Something something human rights.

3949
02:57:12,560 --> 02:57:13,340
We're sending...

3950
02:57:13,340 --> 02:57:15,480
We're letting these guys kill our children.

3951
02:57:21,610 --> 02:57:24,630
Fuck you send William Afton into the front lines.

3952
02:57:26,410 --> 02:57:28,050
Apparently he can't die.

3953
02:57:37,680 --> 02:57:40,420
Letting is a strong word.

3954
02:57:44,140 --> 02:57:44,940
Alright.

3955
02:57:45,120 --> 02:57:45,720
Let's find...

3956
02:57:45,720 --> 02:57:46,600
LEAVE!

3957
02:57:46,980 --> 02:57:48,040
OH MY GOD!

3958
02:57:48,220 --> 02:57:48,760
LEAVE!

3959
02:57:57,400 --> 02:57:58,200
Alright.

3960
02:58:00,140 --> 02:58:00,920
Bro, this...

3961
02:58:00,920 --> 02:58:03,640
This fucking factory could make millions of dollars.

3962
02:58:05,440 --> 02:58:07,640
Instead, he's just killing kids.

3963
02:58:11,990 --> 02:58:12,610
Yeah.

3964
02:58:14,570 --> 02:58:17,610
I think there's like a locker right down here.

3965
02:58:20,190 --> 02:58:22,310
Oh my god, he was like right behind me.

3966
02:58:22,550 --> 02:58:23,070
C'mon!

3967
02:58:23,910 --> 02:58:24,470
Cyclone!

3968
02:58:24,570 --> 02:58:25,770
Thank you for the super chat!

3969
02:58:25,990 --> 02:58:26,290
Thank you!

3970
02:58:26,470 --> 02:58:27,030
Thank you!

3971
02:58:27,430 --> 02:58:28,650
Fuck them kids!

3972
02:58:28,850 --> 02:58:29,650
John Cena!

3973
02:58:31,870 --> 02:58:33,210
Where is he running to?

3974
02:58:36,590 --> 02:58:41,150
Is he lost?

3975
02:58:49,780 --> 02:58:51,960
I don't even know where I lowered this shit.

3976
02:58:53,360 --> 02:58:55,540
He just had too much energy apparently.

3977
02:58:57,300 --> 02:58:57,920
Oh!

3978
02:59:00,220 --> 02:59:14,260
What the fuck the- Where the fuck do you- Why did he teleported behind me?

3979
02:59:20,600 --> 02:59:24,420
He was- He actually teleported!

3980
02:59:25,840 --> 02:59:28,100
Oh my god, that head better be there.

3981
02:59:28,500 --> 02:59:32,120
That head better be on that exact same 3D plane of existence.

3982
02:59:32,180 --> 02:59:35,520
I swear to god, if he goes 4D, I swear to god.

3983
02:59:38,430 --> 02:59:40,470
Bro, he took swap clothes!

3984
02:59:49,770 --> 02:59:51,190
Where did I throw the head?

3985
02:59:58,180 --> 02:59:59,660
Oh my god, I don't know where I threw it.

3986
03:00:05,440 --> 03:00:06,580
Where did I throw it?

3987
03:00:13,130 --> 03:00:14,370
Where did I throw it?

3988
03:00:18,270 --> 03:00:19,010
It's right here.

3989
03:00:20,590 --> 03:00:21,510
Oh, it's right here.

3990
03:00:25,890 --> 03:00:28,990
Oh my god, why- Why is this so heavy?

3991
03:00:29,410 --> 03:00:30,130
Oh wait, he did it.

3992
03:00:30,910 --> 03:00:32,030
Oh my god, we did it.

3993
03:00:32,310 --> 03:00:34,410
Oh, I forgot he needs arms.

3994
03:00:34,410 --> 03:00:35,010
Does he?

3995
03:00:35,270 --> 03:00:36,730
No, he doesn't need arms.

3996
03:00:37,010 --> 03:00:38,110
Hey, Arnold's here.

3997
03:00:38,210 --> 03:00:39,590
No, he needs arms!

3998
03:00:41,250 --> 03:00:43,290
Well, just use my arms!

3999
03:00:43,810 --> 03:00:45,890
He can't tell the difference!

4000
03:00:49,030 --> 03:00:51,350
There's no way he can tell the difference!

4001
03:00:55,570 --> 03:00:57,550
Oh my god, where are the arms?

4002
03:00:58,270 --> 03:01:00,070
I only found legs.

4003
03:01:00,350 --> 03:01:01,950
I never got that far.

4004
03:01:07,120 --> 03:01:10,100
I only saw legs!

4005
03:01:15,490 --> 03:01:18,170
Oh no, I...

4006
03:01:18,170 --> 03:01:18,910
Oh!

4007
03:01:24,800 --> 03:01:26,120
I was cheating!

4008
03:01:27,180 --> 03:01:29,240
I was cheating!

4009
03:01:30,140 --> 03:01:31,900
I was cheating!

4010
03:01:32,200 --> 03:01:33,780
It was right next to me!

4011
03:01:35,800 --> 03:01:36,760
Oh, thank god.

4012
03:01:36,820 --> 03:01:38,580
At least it saved me with the head.

4013
03:01:38,740 --> 03:01:40,340
I don't have to do the whole thing again.

4014
03:01:41,400 --> 03:01:43,040
That's actually crazy.

4015
03:01:44,380 --> 03:01:45,720
Yeah, but it didn't work!

4016
03:01:54,670 --> 03:01:57,110
He literally teleported behind me!

4017
03:01:57,490 --> 03:02:01,430
Or, like, behind me, teleported in front of me and was like, fuck you in particular.

4018
03:02:02,310 --> 03:02:03,410
Like, you don't!

4019
03:02:03,490 --> 03:02:04,430
That's bullshit!

4020
03:02:04,870 --> 03:02:05,570
That's bullshit!

4021
03:02:05,570 --> 03:02:06,110
That's actually bullshit!

4022
03:02:08,050 --> 03:02:09,610
What the fuck are the hands?

4023
03:02:11,260 --> 03:02:12,810
There's only legs here!

4024
03:02:16,690 --> 03:02:18,830
Oh, I see our legs!

4025
03:02:24,730 --> 03:02:26,230
What, you saw them?

4026
03:02:30,640 --> 03:02:32,040
I hear them.

4027
03:02:37,320 --> 03:02:38,160
Thingy nose.

4028
03:02:47,510 --> 03:02:48,830
Does he think he knew?

4029
03:02:50,010 --> 03:02:51,790
Yes, I think he did.

4030
03:02:51,990 --> 03:02:52,110
No.

4031
03:02:57,890 --> 03:02:58,290
Alright.

4032
03:02:59,650 --> 03:03:00,230
I don't know.

4033
03:03:00,530 --> 03:03:03,770
Like, we locked eyes, but I had, you know, I thought he was a homie.

4034
03:03:07,410 --> 03:03:08,950
You may- I don't know.

4035
03:03:09,290 --> 03:03:14,290
We did make eye contact, but I thought, you know, he was gonna turn around.

4036
03:03:14,470 --> 03:03:15,790
I thought he'd be a homie, you know?

4037
03:03:16,770 --> 03:03:17,490
Oh, no.

4038
03:03:17,590 --> 03:03:18,050
Not now.

4039
03:03:18,210 --> 03:03:19,530
I didn't mean turn around now.

4040
03:03:22,750 --> 03:03:24,490
It's not what I mean!

4041
03:03:24,890 --> 03:03:27,110
But I said turn around!

4042
03:03:31,220 --> 03:03:32,580
He did see it.

4043
03:03:37,460 --> 03:03:37,980
Alright.

4044
03:03:39,320 --> 03:03:40,200
Oh my god.

4045
03:03:40,520 --> 03:03:41,740
Might as well just die.

4046
03:03:42,220 --> 03:03:43,400
Might as well.

4047
03:03:43,820 --> 03:03:45,420
Might as well restart!

4048
03:03:48,340 --> 03:03:49,420
The fuck is he going?

4049
03:03:55,690 --> 03:03:56,010
Okay.

4050
03:03:56,830 --> 03:03:58,430
The arm is downstairs.

4051
03:04:02,670 --> 03:04:04,790
What the fuck is- Is it this arm?

4052
03:04:08,970 --> 03:04:10,910
Oh, it's right here!

4053
03:04:14,540 --> 03:04:15,140
I swear!

4054
03:04:15,260 --> 03:04:17,580
I swear to God, if this guy fucking comes to life, I swear to God.

4055
03:04:19,460 --> 03:04:20,380
Oh my god.

4056
03:04:20,520 --> 03:04:21,300
I went the wrong way.

4057
03:04:25,340 --> 03:04:26,480
I got lost.

4058
03:04:26,760 --> 03:04:29,160
I got- I got lost!

4059
03:04:29,840 --> 03:04:30,380
Alright.

4060
03:04:31,060 --> 03:04:32,300
Arm number one!

4061
03:04:35,780 --> 03:04:37,740
Okay, arm number two time.

4062
03:04:43,630 --> 03:04:44,930
Don't hear him.

4063
03:04:45,250 --> 03:04:45,470
Don't hear him.

4064
03:04:48,670 --> 03:04:50,310
You come to life, I swear to God.

4065
03:04:50,310 --> 03:04:50,750
You come to life, I swear to God.

4066
03:04:54,010 --> 03:04:55,370
Oh, it's this area.

4067
03:04:58,650 --> 03:04:59,490
No man?

4068
03:05:01,930 --> 03:05:04,210
Wait, where's the other arm then?

4069
03:05:09,340 --> 03:05:11,060
Wait, where would the other arm be?

4070
03:05:11,460 --> 03:05:11,460
Wait,

4071
03:05:17,390 --> 03:05:17,390
where would the other arm be?

4072
03:05:17,390 --> 03:05:19,510
Is the other arm in that same area?

4073
03:05:23,450 --> 03:05:26,510
Do I have to go straight to that area?

4074
03:05:28,590 --> 03:05:30,430
Where the fuck is the last arm?

4075
03:05:31,570 --> 03:05:31,830
Where

4076
03:05:42,600 --> 03:05:42,600
the fuck is the last arm?

4077
03:05:42,960 --> 03:05:43,860
Oh my god.

4078
03:05:44,100 --> 03:05:44,980
He's so jolly.

4079
03:05:45,360 --> 03:05:46,880
It's on the bottom floor.

4080
03:05:47,060 --> 03:05:47,240
Okay.

4081
03:05:47,840 --> 03:05:49,200
I'll go this way then.

4082
03:05:53,330 --> 03:05:54,930
Where the fuck is the last arm?

4083
03:06:02,660 --> 03:06:03,220
Hello?

4084
03:06:04,980 --> 03:06:07,160
It's somewhere he- Guys, thank you.

4085
03:06:09,320 --> 03:06:09,880
Wow.

4086
03:06:11,920 --> 03:06:13,640
It's somewhere here.

4087
03:06:18,780 --> 03:06:20,160
It's just here.

4088
03:06:20,420 --> 03:06:20,740
Somewhere.

4089
03:06:21,500 --> 03:06:22,660
Wait, I passed it?

4090
03:06:24,620 --> 03:06:26,380
It wasn't even glowing.

4091
03:06:29,300 --> 03:06:30,360
I can't walk over.

4092
03:06:34,810 --> 03:06:36,130
Somewhere there!

4093
03:06:39,250 --> 03:06:41,230
How did I fucking pass it?

4094
03:06:44,030 --> 03:06:47,310
We locked eyes, but then he just went on the other side.

4095
03:06:50,210 --> 03:06:53,170
Guys, I think- I don't think he- I think he saw me.

4096
03:06:56,010 --> 03:06:58,330
Oh, it was hanging on the wall of chains.

4097
03:06:59,070 --> 03:07:02,030
Oh, it's knock- Oh my god, that's actually bullshit.

4098
03:07:02,330 --> 03:07:04,510
They actually made it not glowing this time.

4099
03:07:05,390 --> 03:07:07,440
All the other parts are glowing!

4100
03:07:07,440 --> 03:07:07,740
It's not glowing!

4101
03:07:11,410 --> 03:07:13,410
And then you're like, fuck it.

4102
03:07:13,510 --> 03:07:15,650
You know everything you learned from playing this game?

4103
03:07:15,910 --> 03:07:19,070
Now you gotta- Now it's not glowing!

4104
03:07:24,850 --> 03:07:25,470
Yeah?

4105
03:07:28,230 --> 03:07:29,210
You saw me?

4106
03:07:36,120 --> 03:07:37,090
Is there somewhere here?

4107
03:07:37,750 --> 03:07:39,190
Am I hot or cold?

4108
03:07:48,780 --> 03:07:49,450
What's this?

4109
03:07:50,390 --> 03:07:53,890
I passed it again?!

4110
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:10,600
Is this where I got my arm?

4111
03:08:14,920 --> 03:08:15,820
Oh my god.

4112
03:08:18,160 --> 03:08:19,780
I don't know if you guys are fucking with me.

4113
03:08:19,960 --> 03:08:20,920
That's the worst part.

4114
03:08:21,200 --> 03:08:26,300
I don't know if you guys are fucking- It's in the- Wait, that bucket right here?

4115
03:08:27,020 --> 03:08:28,900
Okay, now I feel like you're fucking with me.

4116
03:08:29,360 --> 03:08:33,940
I- You're hot, but I don't know where the arm is.

4117
03:08:34,280 --> 03:08:38,310
I- Ha-haha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

4118
03:08:39,330 --> 03:08:40,090
Okay.

4119
03:08:40,810 --> 03:08:46,350
Okay, now I definitely know you're fucking- What the

4120
03:08:52,420 --> 03:08:54,160
fuck is this stupid arm...

4121
03:08:58,150 --> 03:08:59,790
Oh hey, I got a mouse.

4122
03:09:11,930 --> 03:09:12,490
Okay.

4123
03:09:13,370 --> 03:09:14,370
I got it outta here.

4124
03:09:19,610 --> 03:09:22,710
What the fuck is this stupid goddamn man?

4125
03:09:25,530 --> 03:09:26,490
Get out of here.

4126
03:09:30,690 --> 03:09:31,530
I don't know.

4127
03:09:34,030 --> 03:09:35,150
It's in that room?

4128
03:09:35,330 --> 03:09:37,410
The room where I just fucking threw a mouse in?

4129
03:09:46,700 --> 03:09:47,600
He's confused.

4130
03:09:52,700 --> 03:09:53,780
Oh my god.

4131
03:09:54,020 --> 03:09:55,080
Oh my god, it's in that room.

4132
03:09:55,200 --> 03:09:55,400
Okay.

4133
03:09:57,820 --> 03:09:58,280
Okay.

4134
03:09:58,880 --> 03:10:03,580
I gotta... I gotta wait until he leaves.

4135
03:10:09,900 --> 03:10:11,040
Is he right beside me?

4136
03:10:17,590 --> 03:10:20,270
We locked eyes, but I don't think he saw me.

4137
03:10:26,020 --> 03:10:26,440
Okay.

4138
03:10:27,680 --> 03:10:29,700
I'm gonna throw another mouse in here.

4139
03:10:32,400 --> 03:10:33,860
Where did I pick up the rat?

4140
03:10:34,960 --> 03:10:37,760
Wait, I don't remember where I picked up the rat.

4141
03:10:38,200 --> 03:10:39,060
Oh, there he is.

4142
03:10:40,900 --> 03:10:43,380
I can look into that room.

4143
03:10:50,020 --> 03:10:51,520
Oh, he's gonna go that way!

4144
03:10:51,880 --> 03:10:52,400
Okay.

4145
03:10:55,720 --> 03:10:58,140
He's gonna... He's gonna go that way!

4146
03:10:58,140 --> 03:10:58,440
Okay!

4147
03:11:01,520 --> 03:11:04,460
Of course, it went all the way around.

4148
03:11:09,520 --> 03:11:10,580
I played myself.

4149
03:11:16,140 --> 03:11:16,740
Okay.

4150
03:11:17,060 --> 03:11:18,000
It's in this room.

4151
03:11:23,390 --> 03:11:24,390
Where is it?

4152
03:11:24,650 --> 03:11:27,530
Where's the goddamn fucking arm?!

4153
03:11:31,850 --> 03:11:33,550
Oh my god, I'm gonna go crazy.

4154
03:11:33,550 --> 03:11:34,670
Oh, fuck!

4155
03:11:38,580 --> 03:11:39,700
It's right here.

4156
03:11:40,720 --> 03:11:41,200
No!

4157
03:11:43,620 --> 03:11:44,100
No!

4158
03:11:44,440 --> 03:11:45,000
Oh my god!

4159
03:11:45,300 --> 03:11:46,140
Oh, that was close!

4160
03:11:46,460 --> 03:11:47,100
That was close!

4161
03:11:49,660 --> 03:11:51,020
Oh my god, that was close!

4162
03:11:51,440 --> 03:11:52,780
Oh, that was so close!

4163
03:11:59,090 --> 03:12:00,390
I don't know where he is.

4164
03:12:11,540 --> 03:12:12,960
Please let me get to the end.

4165
03:12:14,880 --> 03:12:16,000
This is...

4166
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:17,300
Gonna be very risky.

4167
03:12:17,500 --> 03:12:19,900
Oh my god, I fucking finally got the arm!

4168
03:12:20,580 --> 03:12:22,440
Oh my god, thank you!

4169
03:12:23,560 --> 03:12:24,160
Finally!

4170
03:12:25,180 --> 03:12:26,900
Become one with me!

4171
03:12:30,400 --> 03:12:31,400
Become one!

4172
03:12:31,540 --> 03:12:32,140
Oh my god.

4173
03:12:33,220 --> 03:12:35,180
Oh my god, I have to restart this.

4174
03:12:37,760 --> 03:12:38,360
Okay.

4175
03:12:39,720 --> 03:12:41,140
Can't become one yet.

4176
03:12:43,560 --> 03:12:44,740
Energize spring lock.

4177
03:12:45,100 --> 03:12:48,480
Actually, nothing's gonna go wrong if I activate the spring lock.

4178
03:12:49,980 --> 03:12:50,460
All right.

4179
03:12:52,500 --> 03:12:53,360
Let's go.

4180
03:12:54,020 --> 03:12:54,800
Oh man.

4181
03:12:58,020 --> 03:12:58,600
Yep.

4182
03:13:00,320 --> 03:13:01,960
Nothing's gonna go wrong now.

4183
03:13:03,780 --> 03:13:04,800
Oh hey, nice.

4184
03:13:04,960 --> 03:13:05,320
I can...

4185
03:13:05,840 --> 03:13:06,680
Go to a boss.

4186
03:13:07,820 --> 03:13:09,380
Where am I supposed to go again?

4187
03:13:09,380 --> 03:13:10,780
Okay, you're big.

4188
03:13:11,320 --> 03:13:12,600
See, that's what I mean!

4189
03:13:12,780 --> 03:13:14,800
How the fuck were they able to get through the door?

4190
03:13:19,520 --> 03:13:20,740
All right, here I go.

4191
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:25,080
Take me down!

4192
03:13:25,840 --> 03:13:27,680
Let me perform for the children!

4193
03:13:30,920 --> 03:13:32,640
All right, I think I'm one of them.

4194
03:13:33,680 --> 03:13:34,160
Oh.

4195
03:13:35,160 --> 03:13:36,420
Oh, I don't think they...

4196
03:13:36,420 --> 03:13:38,200
I don't think they think that anymore.

4197
03:13:38,480 --> 03:13:39,100
Hey guys!

4198
03:13:39,520 --> 03:13:40,400
I'm one of you.

4199
03:13:40,580 --> 03:13:41,060
Oh, hey!

4200
03:13:43,200 --> 03:13:43,680
Friends!

4201
03:13:45,480 --> 03:13:46,440
We're friends!

4202
03:13:47,200 --> 03:13:47,560
Look at that!

4203
03:13:47,600 --> 03:13:48,240
You said hi!

4204
03:13:49,580 --> 03:13:51,220
That fucking idiot.

4205
03:13:52,020 --> 03:13:53,140
Can I do this?

4206
03:13:53,540 --> 03:13:53,960
No.

4207
03:13:54,560 --> 03:13:55,580
I knew it.

4208
03:13:56,940 --> 03:13:57,800
Oh my god!

4209
03:13:57,940 --> 03:13:58,720
What am I doing?

4210
03:13:58,920 --> 03:14:00,540
I didn't know I could get outside!

4211
03:14:03,620 --> 03:14:05,820
Imagine if I did that right next to him.

4212
03:14:05,820 --> 03:14:08,400
I didn't even know you could leave!

4213
03:14:14,770 --> 03:14:16,130
I didn't know!

4214
03:14:16,450 --> 03:14:18,870
I didn't think I could just leave my suit!

4215
03:14:19,410 --> 03:14:20,930
My safety suit!

4216
03:14:24,410 --> 03:14:25,170
All right.

4217
03:14:28,380 --> 03:14:30,280
I thought I was gonna be there forever!

4218
03:14:35,040 --> 03:14:36,500
Yeah, open the lever.

4219
03:14:37,380 --> 03:14:38,120
Oh my god!

4220
03:14:38,300 --> 03:14:39,480
It's another puzzle time!

4221
03:14:41,180 --> 03:14:41,620
Okay.

4222
03:14:44,900 --> 03:14:45,580
Okay.

4223
03:14:48,500 --> 03:14:49,180
Then...

4224
03:14:52,330 --> 03:14:53,510
Wait, where...

4225
03:14:54,110 --> 03:14:54,450
Oh!

4226
03:14:54,870 --> 03:14:56,630
I can't even fix this!

4227
03:14:57,350 --> 03:14:58,510
Oh, what the fuck?

4228
03:14:58,590 --> 03:14:59,530
It's broken anyway!

4229
03:15:02,610 --> 03:15:03,290
Oh!

4230
03:15:03,550 --> 03:15:04,130
Never mind!

4231
03:15:04,690 --> 03:15:05,750
Guys, I fixed it!

4232
03:15:07,250 --> 03:15:08,390
Never mind!

4233
03:15:08,730 --> 03:15:09,330
Okay!

4234
03:15:09,630 --> 03:15:10,650
Guys, I fixed it!

4235
03:15:10,750 --> 03:15:11,750
It was just that easy!

4236
03:15:12,350 --> 03:15:12,950
There we go!

4237
03:15:15,190 --> 03:15:18,090
I didn't know it was just the side of the machine!

4238
03:15:19,630 --> 03:15:20,170
Land!

4239
03:15:20,470 --> 03:15:21,530
No time limit!

4240
03:15:23,050 --> 03:15:24,010
Look at that!

4241
03:15:25,990 --> 03:15:27,990
Guys, it was a speed run tech!

4242
03:15:28,130 --> 03:15:31,930
So, I didn't have to feel pressured with the time limit!

4243
03:15:32,770 --> 03:15:33,970
It's so smart!

4244
03:15:35,730 --> 03:15:36,950
Where's your speed here?

4245
03:15:36,950 --> 03:15:37,230
Oh!

4246
03:15:38,550 --> 03:15:40,810
Okay, but without me...

4247
03:15:40,810 --> 03:15:41,950
No, I feel like...

4248
03:15:43,150 --> 03:15:44,290
I'm not going back...

4249
03:15:44,290 --> 03:15:44,610
Oh!

4250
03:15:45,110 --> 03:15:47,050
I can't go back to the suit!

4251
03:15:47,990 --> 03:15:48,630
No!

4252
03:15:49,010 --> 03:15:49,810
I can't!

4253
03:15:58,930 --> 03:15:59,570
Because...

4254
03:15:59,570 --> 03:16:02,370
My skinny ass legs can't fucking jump!

4255
03:16:07,960 --> 03:16:08,600
Okay.

4256
03:16:10,460 --> 03:16:11,360
Oh god!

4257
03:16:11,640 --> 03:16:12,260
I need to...

4258
03:16:12,260 --> 03:16:14,180
I need to get back in the suit, Doki!

4259
03:16:15,240 --> 03:16:18,160
What if I don't want to get back in the suit?

4260
03:16:21,660 --> 03:16:22,800
Okay, like...

4261
03:16:22,800 --> 03:16:22,920
How?

4262
03:16:33,320 --> 03:16:35,000
This is super risky.

4263
03:16:36,760 --> 03:16:39,060
What I'm doing is very...

4264
03:16:43,200 --> 03:16:45,580
Okay, I didn't think she would turn around.

4265
03:16:54,930 --> 03:16:55,490
Okay.

4266
03:16:58,190 --> 03:17:00,250
I don't know where the other...

4267
03:17:00,250 --> 03:17:01,570
Where the other locker was.

4268
03:17:01,930 --> 03:17:03,030
I don't remember.

4269
03:17:05,770 --> 03:17:07,530
Get back in the suit, Doki!

4270
03:17:10,330 --> 03:17:12,150
No, I don't think he has thumbs.

4271
03:17:12,690 --> 03:17:13,990
You can't open a locker.

4272
03:17:14,990 --> 03:17:16,150
Got your thumbs.

4273
03:17:25,230 --> 03:17:26,830
I actually don't know.

4274
03:17:27,210 --> 03:17:29,930
I don't remember where the other locker is.

4275
03:17:42,150 --> 03:17:43,170
What's right there?

4276
03:17:50,520 --> 03:17:51,740
Yeah, that's right.

4277
03:17:52,480 --> 03:17:53,540
That's fucking right.

4278
03:17:53,660 --> 03:17:54,280
What you gonna do?

4279
03:17:54,400 --> 03:17:55,660
Open my locker?

4280
03:17:56,020 --> 03:17:56,580
That's right.

4281
03:17:56,640 --> 03:17:58,020
I know you have no thumbs.

4282
03:18:05,350 --> 03:18:05,990
Stupid.

4283
03:18:09,940 --> 03:18:10,980
I'm your friend.

4284
03:18:11,220 --> 03:18:11,600
Friend!

4285
03:18:11,960 --> 03:18:12,120
Friend!

4286
03:18:13,420 --> 03:18:13,880
Friend!

4287
03:18:14,500 --> 03:18:15,080
Hi.

4288
03:18:16,180 --> 03:18:16,820
Hi.

4289
03:18:17,560 --> 03:18:18,500
I'm friend.

4290
03:18:21,800 --> 03:18:22,680
That's right.

4291
03:18:22,980 --> 03:18:24,420
I was always here.

4292
03:18:24,620 --> 03:18:25,100
Oh my god.

4293
03:18:25,320 --> 03:18:27,600
Where did that stupid guy went?

4294
03:18:27,840 --> 03:18:28,520
I know, right?

4295
03:18:28,660 --> 03:18:29,900
Where did he go?

4296
03:18:30,580 --> 03:18:32,020
Don't worry, friend.

4297
03:18:32,020 --> 03:18:34,460
We'll get him next time.

4298
03:18:35,260 --> 03:18:36,220
Oh my god.

4299
03:18:36,620 --> 03:18:36,760
Word.

4300
03:18:37,080 --> 03:18:38,820
Did you see that human just now?

4301
03:18:39,140 --> 03:18:39,400
Man.

4302
03:18:39,740 --> 03:18:40,620
Must have missed him.

4303
03:18:40,780 --> 03:18:41,760
I didn't see him at all.

4304
03:18:44,880 --> 03:18:46,000
It's a mystery.

4305
03:18:49,460 --> 03:18:50,020
Okay.

4306
03:18:52,160 --> 03:18:52,440
All right.

4307
03:18:55,200 --> 03:18:56,740
Should be safe here now.

4308
03:18:57,560 --> 03:18:58,120
All right.

4309
03:18:58,200 --> 03:18:59,120
I'll get out of here.

4310
03:18:59,920 --> 03:19:00,200
Whoops.

4311
03:19:00,440 --> 03:19:01,840
I blocked myself.

4312
03:19:02,420 --> 03:19:02,580
Whoops.

4313
03:19:02,960 --> 03:19:03,660
Don't worry.

4314
03:19:04,260 --> 03:19:05,200
I just...

4315
03:19:05,200 --> 03:19:06,020
There we go.

4316
03:19:06,180 --> 03:19:07,080
I turned my...

4317
03:19:07,080 --> 03:19:08,840
Just turned myself around.

4318
03:19:09,780 --> 03:19:10,260
There we go.

4319
03:19:12,440 --> 03:19:12,920
Thanks.

4320
03:19:15,720 --> 03:19:18,160
You weren't even supposed to be there.

4321
03:19:18,340 --> 03:19:19,460
You were supposed to be here.

4322
03:19:19,620 --> 03:19:20,500
Me and David.

4323
03:19:21,160 --> 03:19:24,800
Oh, how am I supposed to tell David that his mother is gone?

4324
03:19:25,040 --> 03:19:25,700
Wait, what?

4325
03:19:26,360 --> 03:19:27,600
How did the mom die?

4326
03:19:28,500 --> 03:19:31,980
He does not sound sad that his fucking wife died.

4327
03:19:34,160 --> 03:19:35,300
Wait, what?

4328
03:19:36,600 --> 03:19:38,700
Why does he just sound annoyed?

4329
03:19:39,380 --> 03:19:41,080
Like, your fucking wife died.

4330
03:19:44,520 --> 03:19:45,940
He just sounds like...

4331
03:19:45,940 --> 03:19:46,420
Aw, man.

4332
03:19:46,820 --> 03:19:47,960
What am I gonna do now?

4333
03:19:48,320 --> 03:19:49,640
Who's gonna take care of the child?

4334
03:19:52,660 --> 03:19:53,540
Aw, shucks.

4335
03:19:53,780 --> 03:19:54,360
My mom...

4336
03:19:54,360 --> 03:19:55,020
My wife died.

4337
03:19:57,740 --> 03:20:00,160
Yeah, it sounds like a minor inconvenience.

4338
03:20:02,180 --> 03:20:03,640
Me and Stan are out of here.

4339
03:20:03,820 --> 03:20:05,820
It's time to jump ship before things get ugly.

4340
03:20:06,140 --> 03:20:08,920
I have a bunch of Fiona's character patterns.

4341
03:20:09,040 --> 03:20:10,300
And Stan is taking what he can.

4342
03:20:11,180 --> 03:20:11,580
Uh...

4343
03:20:11,580 --> 03:20:13,340
Oh, I have a bunch of Fiona's character patterns.

4344
03:20:13,380 --> 03:20:14,380
And Stan is taking what he can.

4345
03:20:14,580 --> 03:20:15,100
Join us.

4346
03:20:15,240 --> 03:20:19,160
With everything we know about the restaurant project, we can start our own machine shop.

4347
03:20:22,480 --> 03:20:23,000
Vacation.

4348
03:20:23,420 --> 03:20:25,500
My weekend vacation request was refused.

4349
03:20:25,880 --> 03:20:26,280
I quit.

4350
03:20:26,680 --> 03:20:28,980
Tell Jake I'll be back for my things on Monday.

4351
03:20:30,660 --> 03:20:33,140
Uh, Lee, the projector is down again in the theater.

4352
03:20:33,340 --> 03:20:33,820
I swear.

4353
03:20:34,520 --> 03:20:36,000
This super show is cursed.

4354
03:20:36,260 --> 03:20:37,520
What was Edwin thinking?

4355
03:20:37,820 --> 03:20:38,820
Making this kid's thing.

4356
03:20:39,080 --> 03:20:41,620
Plus, those things just creep me out.

4357
03:20:44,460 --> 03:20:47,000
Okay, something was trying to talk to me earlier.

4358
03:20:47,000 --> 03:20:49,020
I think it's the mimic.

4359
03:20:54,380 --> 03:20:54,980
Hello?

4360
03:20:58,260 --> 03:21:00,180
I'm here for the show.

4361
03:21:02,520 --> 03:21:04,660
I'm not here for the show.

4362
03:21:04,900 --> 03:21:06,580
Oh, I have to get out here.

4363
03:21:06,800 --> 03:21:07,540
Okay, never mind.

4364
03:21:08,700 --> 03:21:11,420
Okay, now I'm here for the show.

4365
03:21:13,320 --> 03:21:14,220
Wait, what?

4366
03:21:14,600 --> 03:21:15,560
Wait, is that target?

4367
03:21:17,220 --> 03:21:18,840
There's a target down here.

4368
03:21:22,880 --> 03:21:23,880
Oh, okay.

4369
03:21:24,400 --> 03:21:26,340
Okay, for real this time.

4370
03:21:26,960 --> 03:21:29,680
Now I'm actually here for the show.

4371
03:21:34,190 --> 03:21:36,450
Welcome, potential investors and buyers.

4372
03:21:37,130 --> 03:21:37,770
That's me.

4373
03:21:37,770 --> 03:21:40,930
Are you getting into the children's television entertainment space?

4374
03:21:41,430 --> 03:21:42,070
Yeah?

4375
03:21:42,070 --> 03:21:46,110
Are the costs of writers, crew, and puppeteers holding you back?

4376
03:21:46,630 --> 03:21:47,790
Yeah, I know, right?

4377
03:21:47,810 --> 03:21:48,630
Paying wages?

4378
03:21:48,630 --> 03:21:49,350
No news for you.

4379
03:21:49,670 --> 03:21:53,630
Welcome to the MCM television studio of the future.

4380
03:21:54,250 --> 03:21:56,730
Here, there's no need for a cast of crew.

4381
03:21:57,390 --> 03:22:05,950
Our patented stage manager software keeps your show on track and condensed to fit your broadcast time slot, including commercial breaks.

4382
03:22:06,590 --> 03:22:09,070
If writers have you blocked, use the MCM story templates.

4383
03:22:09,070 --> 03:22:09,870
Why are you choosing me?

4384
03:22:10,070 --> 03:22:11,250
I'm listening to lore!

4385
03:22:11,690 --> 03:22:12,190
It's lore!

4386
03:22:12,670 --> 03:22:16,290
Page manager with the desired character names, location, and genre.

4387
03:22:16,790 --> 03:22:18,310
It writes itself.

4388
03:22:19,290 --> 03:22:21,490
Additional story templates available for purchase.

4389
03:22:21,490 --> 03:22:23,610
What about the talent?

4390
03:22:23,930 --> 03:22:26,710
Well, we removed the talent.

4391
03:22:26,990 --> 03:22:27,270
What?

4392
03:22:27,790 --> 03:22:29,330
No difficult puppeteers.

4393
03:22:29,330 --> 03:22:30,270
Oh my god, it's like AI.

4394
03:22:32,810 --> 03:22:35,270
Our system is drama-free.

4395
03:22:36,050 --> 03:22:38,090
Oh my god, we're using AI.

4396
03:22:38,610 --> 03:22:41,030
By shooting targets to progress the story.

4397
03:22:41,710 --> 03:22:44,890
And of course, you'll save a fortune on production costs.

4398
03:22:45,490 --> 03:22:50,710
The MCM studio comes equipped with automated cameras, props, and lights.

4399
03:22:51,890 --> 03:22:53,410
He's an AI bro!

4400
03:22:54,810 --> 03:23:04,150
This example show is written and performed by a single costumed writer, director, cameraman, puppeteer, producer, in front of an automated studio audience.

4401
03:23:08,110 --> 03:23:12,950
All right, there was a little tiger there that wanted to fucking kill me.

4402
03:23:15,010 --> 03:23:16,250
Get in line!

4403
03:23:16,650 --> 03:23:17,950
They all want to kill me!

4404
03:23:18,750 --> 03:23:19,910
That's the secret!

4405
03:23:20,230 --> 03:23:21,510
Wait, where did the tiger go?

4406
03:23:23,150 --> 03:23:24,890
Oh, I don't have access to this.

4407
03:23:26,450 --> 03:23:27,350
He's forgetting.

4408
03:23:30,130 --> 03:23:37,230
I don't like that the mimic is using children, children's voices right now.

4409
03:23:40,690 --> 03:23:41,610
What's this?

4410
03:23:48,350 --> 03:23:49,670
What am I supposed to do?

4411
03:23:53,150 --> 03:23:55,090
I'm in a creating machine right now?

4412
03:23:57,150 --> 03:23:57,650
Oh!

4413
03:23:58,370 --> 03:24:00,070
I'm gonna move this closer!

4414
03:24:00,810 --> 03:24:02,350
Where am I supposed to go, though?

4415
03:24:06,940 --> 03:24:08,640
Am I supposed to go to the other side?

4416
03:24:09,720 --> 03:24:10,080
Wait.

4417
03:24:15,600 --> 03:24:15,960
Okay.

4418
03:24:17,660 --> 03:24:18,440
I have this?

4419
03:24:18,580 --> 03:24:19,000
No, okay.

4420
03:24:19,120 --> 03:24:20,180
I have to go to the other side.

4421
03:24:20,340 --> 03:24:20,960
Okay, I get it.

4422
03:24:22,820 --> 03:24:24,920
I wasn't sure where the pathway was.

4423
03:24:32,240 --> 03:24:34,480
I understand for real now.

4424
03:24:35,080 --> 03:24:36,020
I understand this time.

4425
03:24:41,920 --> 03:24:42,520
Okay.

4426
03:24:42,820 --> 03:24:44,240
That has to be the end of that area.

4427
03:24:46,440 --> 03:24:46,800
And then...

4428
03:24:50,180 --> 03:24:51,120
Remove that.

4429
03:24:53,520 --> 03:24:55,700
Wouldn't it be easier if we just had two bridges?

4430
03:24:59,500 --> 03:25:01,240
Is this really saving money?

4431
03:25:02,940 --> 03:25:04,960
Why don't he just build two bridges?

4432
03:25:08,160 --> 03:25:13,040
Like, every time I need to cross the bridge, I gotta play a crane game.

4433
03:25:13,480 --> 03:25:17,900
Oh yeah, and using the power to operate this is much more cheaper.

4434
03:25:18,460 --> 03:25:19,560
Is he stupid?

4435
03:25:27,500 --> 03:25:28,520
Isn't that it?

4436
03:25:30,840 --> 03:25:32,680
Yeah, is he fucking stupid?

4437
03:25:33,560 --> 03:25:35,140
Just build a bridge!

4438
03:25:41,920 --> 03:25:44,100
Oh wait, I was supposed to go down.

4439
03:25:53,830 --> 03:25:55,250
I was supposed to go here.

4440
03:25:57,010 --> 03:25:58,410
And lower this.

4441
03:26:01,250 --> 03:26:02,530
What am I lowering?

4442
03:26:03,070 --> 03:26:04,330
Oh, another bridge.

4443
03:26:06,930 --> 03:26:08,610
Oh, I have to lower both bridges.

4444
03:26:09,990 --> 03:26:11,310
Crank that soldier boy.

4445
03:26:11,770 --> 03:26:13,070
Crank that soldier boy.

4446
03:26:18,380 --> 03:26:18,940
There we go.

4447
03:26:18,980 --> 03:26:21,120
And I just need to hit that target so I have to go back.

4448
03:26:23,640 --> 03:26:24,960
We don't make sense here.

4449
03:26:25,100 --> 03:26:26,160
We make dollars.

4450
03:26:26,760 --> 03:26:27,680
They give this super chat.

4451
03:26:28,100 --> 03:26:28,660
I'm so thank you.

4452
03:26:28,840 --> 03:26:29,400
Thank you.

4453
03:26:30,300 --> 03:26:31,380
Okay, I gotta go down now.

4454
03:26:39,540 --> 03:26:41,360
I'll go back to my suit.

4455
03:26:42,240 --> 03:26:43,180
Oh my god.

4456
03:26:44,920 --> 03:26:46,420
All right, Apako.

4457
03:26:51,070 --> 03:26:52,370
This company's gonna go.

4458
03:26:52,450 --> 03:26:53,730
It's already in debt.

4459
03:26:54,490 --> 03:26:54,970
That's why.

4460
03:26:55,450 --> 03:26:57,470
That's why nobody's alive.

4461
03:26:59,010 --> 03:27:00,750
That's why you don't see anybody.

4462
03:27:02,550 --> 03:27:03,090
All right.

4463
03:27:07,690 --> 03:27:11,750
Time to go downstairs.

4464
03:27:19,190 --> 03:27:19,930
Okay.

4465
03:27:20,910 --> 03:27:22,150
Oh my god, am I the main star?

4466
03:27:26,740 --> 03:27:28,340
Oh, there's Foxy.

4467
03:27:28,920 --> 03:27:32,080
Oh my god, it's pilot Foxy.

4468
03:27:32,980 --> 03:27:34,500
Down in the dark smoke.

4469
03:27:35,020 --> 03:27:37,220
Today's the big surprise party.

4470
03:27:37,640 --> 03:27:38,900
You should be excited.

4471
03:27:39,720 --> 03:27:43,440
I'm sad because today is the big surprise party.

4472
03:27:43,720 --> 03:27:45,240
Okay, this feels AI generated.

4473
03:27:46,220 --> 03:27:47,040
I forgot it's a gift.

4474
03:27:47,040 --> 03:27:47,060
It's a disaster.

4475
03:27:47,560 --> 03:27:50,000
Make me up a kid's play with Foxy.

4476
03:27:50,240 --> 03:27:50,600
Shiver.

4477
03:27:51,160 --> 03:27:51,860
Timbers.

4478
03:27:52,160 --> 03:27:53,020
No gift.

4479
03:27:53,940 --> 03:27:56,000
All hands on deck.

4480
03:27:56,320 --> 03:27:58,120
All hands on deck.

4481
03:28:02,340 --> 03:28:03,980
Foxy was an idea.

4482
03:28:04,700 --> 03:28:07,640
Oh my god, William Henry did steal Foxy!

4483
03:28:19,200 --> 03:28:23,680
Oh my god, William Henry did steal Foxy!

4484
03:28:34,100 --> 03:28:38,580
Oh wait, that's the... that's not a collectible.

4485
03:28:45,680 --> 03:28:47,600
Wait, was Roxy their IP too?

4486
03:28:47,800 --> 03:28:48,960
Oh my god, there's Roxy!

4487
03:28:52,800 --> 03:28:55,180
They stole Foxy and Roxy!

4488
03:28:55,580 --> 03:28:56,820
We shall copyright that!

4489
03:29:10,820 --> 03:29:12,960
Dude, that is actually so creepy.

4490
03:29:20,320 --> 03:29:22,100
We're supposed to shoot that, right?

4491
03:29:30,220 --> 03:29:30,740
Okay.

4492
03:29:30,740 --> 03:29:33,220
I'm shooting targets, am I doing it?

4493
03:29:41,160 --> 03:29:44,040
I don't know if I'm actually supposed to shoot the targets.

4494
03:29:49,230 --> 03:29:50,570
I don't know, am I winning?

4495
03:29:50,930 --> 03:29:51,850
I can't tell!

4496
03:29:52,110 --> 03:29:53,510
There's so many targets!

4497
03:29:56,270 --> 03:29:57,110
Am I winning?

4498
03:29:57,870 --> 03:29:58,830
Oh, I did it!

4499
03:29:58,890 --> 03:29:59,290
I won!

4500
03:29:59,710 --> 03:30:00,410
I got a gift!

4501
03:30:02,150 --> 03:30:02,790
What?

4502
03:30:02,950 --> 03:30:04,230
Bonjour, Monsieur Foxy!

4503
03:30:04,450 --> 03:30:05,870
The snacks are ready!

4504
03:30:06,650 --> 03:30:09,950
Bernard, how much did he make?

4505
03:30:10,650 --> 03:30:12,630
Hello, there was no gift!

4506
03:30:13,230 --> 03:30:15,790
So, I made a little extra...

4507
03:30:15,790 --> 03:30:17,390
Wait, the set is collapsing!

4508
03:30:25,930 --> 03:30:26,470
What?

4509
03:30:26,690 --> 03:30:27,350
No party snacks?

4510
03:30:27,610 --> 03:30:28,590
What now, Foxy?

4511
03:30:32,390 --> 03:30:33,910
Oh, I have to...

4512
03:30:33,910 --> 03:30:36,410
Okay, I realized...

4513
03:30:36,410 --> 03:30:39,450
I was not supposed to shoot the birds!

4514
03:30:41,230 --> 03:30:42,670
But where are the party snacks?

4515
03:30:44,530 --> 03:30:45,330
Oh, there's...

4516
03:30:45,330 --> 03:30:46,350
Oh, there's some here!

4517
03:30:51,060 --> 03:30:53,860
Oh, I'm like actually changing everything!

4518
03:30:57,260 --> 03:30:58,040
They're like...

4519
03:30:58,040 --> 03:31:00,180
They're like booing because I shot the audience!

4520
03:31:02,800 --> 03:31:04,380
No party snacks!

4521
03:31:04,680 --> 03:31:05,260
No party snacks!

4522
03:31:05,260 --> 03:31:05,980
Foxy said no!

4523
03:31:08,520 --> 03:31:10,180
I'm gonna shoot my crewmate...

4524
03:31:16,100 --> 03:31:16,740
Eh...

4525
03:31:16,740 --> 03:31:18,200
Jesus Christ...

4526
03:31:18,200 --> 03:31:19,340
I don't know like...

4527
03:31:19,340 --> 03:31:21,620
I don't know if I'm accomplishing anything!

4528
03:31:26,740 --> 03:31:27,380
I...

4529
03:31:27,380 --> 03:31:28,380
Oh, awesome!

4530
03:31:31,880 --> 03:31:33,060
Oh, that's for me!

4531
03:31:33,900 --> 03:31:34,640
Oh!

4532
03:31:35,500 --> 03:31:36,220
Oh!

4533
03:31:36,220 --> 03:31:37,020
Well done!

4534
03:31:37,700 --> 03:31:37,720
Awesome!

4535
03:31:38,400 --> 03:31:39,040
Foxy!

4536
03:31:39,320 --> 03:31:40,060
Foxy!

4537
03:31:40,540 --> 03:31:41,280
Rocktopus!

4538
03:31:41,860 --> 03:31:42,230
Rocktopus!

4539
03:31:42,600 --> 03:31:44,200
Rocktopus on the starboard bow!

4540
03:31:44,200 --> 03:31:44,920
Rocktopus?

4541
03:31:45,000 --> 03:31:46,100
Where's the Rocktopus?

4542
03:31:46,280 --> 03:31:46,880
Foxy!

4543
03:31:47,400 --> 03:31:48,140
Foxy!

4544
03:31:48,180 --> 03:31:50,300
Oh, I like how the set was broken right here.

4545
03:31:50,600 --> 03:31:51,660
Rocktopi are drawn to boat parties!

4546
03:31:52,400 --> 03:31:55,800
This is why sailors don't have boat parties!

4547
03:31:56,660 --> 03:31:58,300
Hey, Meowth!

4548
03:31:58,880 --> 03:32:00,400
That's Rocktopus!

4549
03:32:01,340 --> 03:32:03,080
What do you got to eat?

4550
03:32:03,600 --> 03:32:03,640
What do you got to eat?

4551
03:32:03,660 --> 03:32:04,420
Come on, lad!

4552
03:32:04,740 --> 03:32:05,680
Stop that, bro!

4553
03:32:06,280 --> 03:32:07,620
Well, Mary Jane...

4554
03:32:07,620 --> 03:32:10,600
That's my favorite name, Scoob!

4555
03:32:11,100 --> 03:32:12,180
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4556
03:32:15,860 --> 03:32:17,580
Yeah, I killed the octopus.

4557
03:32:19,600 --> 03:32:21,160
Okay, now I'm doing stuff.

4558
03:32:22,460 --> 03:32:24,260
Now I'm actually doing stuff.

4559
03:32:24,800 --> 03:32:26,940
Don't worry, I'm contributing to the team!

4560
03:32:35,200 --> 03:32:38,900
I'm just destroying, like, thousands of dollars worth of property.

4561
03:32:39,120 --> 03:32:39,600
Let's go.

4562
03:32:39,860 --> 03:32:41,720
We're in my $25 gift card.

4563
03:32:47,690 --> 03:32:49,770
Oh my god, it's so far away.

4564
03:32:50,390 --> 03:32:51,430
Oh no, he's going!

4565
03:32:51,670 --> 03:32:52,610
No, I'm sorry!

4566
03:32:55,650 --> 03:32:57,530
I'm doing my best!

4567
03:32:58,250 --> 03:33:00,130
I'm shooting everything!

4568
03:33:03,470 --> 03:33:04,350
Okay.

4569
03:33:05,550 --> 03:33:05,990
Yay!

4570
03:33:09,970 --> 03:33:12,130
Jesus, how many fucking...

4571
03:33:12,130 --> 03:33:12,950
Oh, there's eight.

4572
03:33:15,850 --> 03:33:17,550
I know, right?

4573
03:33:17,890 --> 03:33:19,350
It's not radical.

4574
03:33:19,350 --> 03:33:19,430
Okay.

4575
03:33:19,790 --> 03:33:21,430
We all work together for once.

4576
03:33:21,830 --> 03:33:22,870
Like a real crew.

4577
03:33:23,210 --> 03:33:26,870
You've made me the happiest captain on the second scene.

4578
03:33:28,150 --> 03:33:28,710
Foxy!

4579
03:33:28,910 --> 03:33:29,810
You did it!

4580
03:33:30,030 --> 03:33:30,830
You did it!

4581
03:33:31,030 --> 03:33:31,510
You found the...

4582
03:33:31,510 --> 03:33:32,710
This is very scary.

4583
03:33:33,390 --> 03:33:37,670
If, like, I was in this building and everything is collapsing around me...

4584
03:33:37,670 --> 03:33:40,130
Then, like, the whole fucking building's gonna collapse.

4585
03:33:48,210 --> 03:33:48,770
Foxy!

4586
03:33:48,770 --> 03:33:51,110
My birthday was last week!

4587
03:33:53,190 --> 03:33:53,730
Aww...

4588
03:33:54,870 --> 03:33:56,330
Forgot his birthday!

4589
03:34:01,510 --> 03:34:03,850
Oh, it's falling apart because...

4590
03:34:03,850 --> 03:34:05,270
Um, everything...

4591
03:34:05,270 --> 03:34:07,450
Every time I shoot a target, it changes the set.

4592
03:34:07,610 --> 03:34:09,730
And I think because the set is really fucking old.

4593
03:34:11,150 --> 03:34:11,690
Um...

4594
03:34:11,690 --> 03:34:14,090
And it hasn't been used in, like, years.

4595
03:34:16,230 --> 03:34:17,730
It's, like, more...

4596
03:34:17,730 --> 03:34:19,510
Like, it's, like, not well-maintained.

4597
03:34:20,410 --> 03:34:21,910
It's also AI-generated.

4598
03:34:22,050 --> 03:34:22,230
What?

4599
03:34:24,510 --> 03:34:25,290
Who are you?

4600
03:34:27,350 --> 03:34:27,990
Your star?

4601
03:34:30,410 --> 03:34:32,270
Yeah, the set was AI-generated.

4602
03:34:35,590 --> 03:34:36,110
Huh?

4603
03:34:42,880 --> 03:34:43,200
Huh?

4604
03:34:49,220 --> 03:34:49,540
Huh?

4605
03:34:57,580 --> 03:35:00,460
Wait, is this Fiona's voice?

4606
03:35:02,980 --> 03:35:05,000
Oh, wait, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

4607
03:35:05,100 --> 03:35:05,700
He's my friend!

4608
03:35:05,700 --> 03:35:09,720
To soften up the remaining organic materials...

4609
03:35:09,720 --> 03:35:10,480
No, no, sorry!

4610
03:35:10,640 --> 03:35:12,500
It-it-it-it's just a friend inside!

4611
03:35:13,000 --> 03:35:16,040
Finally, we will flush out your interior with a power hose.

4612
03:35:16,360 --> 03:35:19,580
Then give you a nice, long soak in the bleach bath.

4613
03:35:19,880 --> 03:35:22,180
You will be ship-shape in no time.

4614
03:35:22,800 --> 03:35:25,200
Please wait here until your number is called.

4615
03:35:25,740 --> 03:35:29,760
There are 4,625 paths ahead of you.

4616
03:35:29,760 --> 03:35:30,260
Oh, thank god.

4617
03:35:30,440 --> 03:35:31,040
Okay, nice.

4618
03:35:31,700 --> 03:35:32,740
We're in the queue.

4619
03:35:36,180 --> 03:35:36,880
That's good.

4620
03:35:37,120 --> 03:35:37,800
Okay, that's good.

4621
03:35:38,020 --> 03:35:38,920
We're in the queue.

4622
03:35:40,660 --> 03:35:44,160
So it'll be like at least 20 more years until she calls on me.

4623
03:35:46,060 --> 03:35:46,900
Thank god.

4624
03:35:47,460 --> 03:35:48,220
We're safe.

4625
03:35:49,400 --> 03:35:52,080
I'm very excited about our next showroom.

4626
03:35:52,960 --> 03:35:56,180
Welcome to the world's first recycling center.

4627
03:35:56,600 --> 03:35:57,500
Recycling center?

4628
03:35:57,780 --> 03:36:00,340
Basically, we take trash and turn it into cash.

4629
03:36:01,280 --> 03:36:02,620
To explain how it all works.

4630
03:36:02,760 --> 03:36:05,620
Contact your friendly cells represent- Oh, there's Nurse Dolly!

4631
03:36:05,620 --> 03:36:06,820
Recycling automation.

4632
03:36:07,480 --> 03:36:09,120
Say hello, Nurse Dolly.

4633
03:36:09,760 --> 03:36:09,960
Say hello, Nurse Dolly.

4634
03:36:09,960 --> 03:36:11,000
Hello, Nurse Dolly.

4635
03:36:11,940 --> 03:36:12,780
That's here.

4636
03:36:14,200 --> 03:36:17,220
I thought it would be fun to go with a doll hospital fee.

4637
03:36:17,580 --> 03:36:18,320
Pretty neat, huh?

4638
03:36:19,320 --> 03:36:20,980
Dolly, tell them what you do.

4639
03:36:21,540 --> 03:36:23,560
I am recycling.

4640
03:36:24,420 --> 03:36:29,740
Edwin Murray coined the term and it will soon be an industry standard.

4641
03:36:29,740 --> 03:36:32,840
Edwin invented recycling.

4642
03:36:34,320 --> 03:36:35,160
Okay.

4643
03:36:35,380 --> 03:36:39,000
I think he might have a little god complex.

4644
03:36:45,700 --> 03:36:50,840
Before Edwin, all we did was just throw our garbage away.

4645
03:36:51,400 --> 03:36:52,360
Into our pit.

4646
03:36:52,360 --> 03:36:55,360
Thank god, Edwin invented recycling.

4647
03:36:56,640 --> 03:36:58,780
We do like various discarded materials.

4648
03:36:59,240 --> 03:37:03,820
I'm talking about broken midway games, costumes, computer...

4649
03:37:03,820 --> 03:37:05,580
Oh, we do about Edwin.

4650
03:37:06,020 --> 03:37:07,980
Toasters, and precious metals.

4651
03:37:08,900 --> 03:37:16,360
Those useless things are then used to create new midway games, costumes, and technologies for your family fun centers.

4652
03:37:17,100 --> 03:37:18,240
What is she doing?

4653
03:37:18,840 --> 03:37:22,160
And what we can't use is broken down into its basic components.

4654
03:37:22,360 --> 03:37:24,400
Which we then sell it a profit.

4655
03:37:27,560 --> 03:37:29,520
Oh, she's gonna kill me.

4656
03:37:30,120 --> 03:37:31,320
Oh, oh, okay.

4657
03:37:31,580 --> 03:37:31,780
Oh.

4658
03:37:32,480 --> 03:37:36,120
Oh, I realized this door opens up to that, to that room.

4659
03:37:37,920 --> 03:37:39,280
I just realized.

4660
03:37:41,080 --> 03:37:41,740
Oh, hello!

4661
03:37:43,440 --> 03:37:44,040
Okay.

4662
03:37:44,500 --> 03:37:45,780
Okay, she can't kill me here.

4663
03:37:46,980 --> 03:37:48,520
I have a little space.

4664
03:37:50,020 --> 03:37:51,160
Okay, open the vent.

4665
03:37:52,980 --> 03:37:55,200
I have a little space that I can just chill in.

4666
03:37:56,280 --> 03:38:00,520
Okay, I just need her to go across, and then I'll just wait from behind.

4667
03:38:01,520 --> 03:38:02,900
Yeah, she's on a set path.

4668
03:38:04,660 --> 03:38:06,360
So I can just wait for her back here.

4669
03:38:10,480 --> 03:38:11,360
Alright, nice.

4670
03:38:13,940 --> 03:38:14,700
Alright, wait.

4671
03:38:14,820 --> 03:38:15,800
Is there anything over there?

4672
03:38:16,040 --> 03:38:16,780
Oh, I...

4673
03:38:16,780 --> 03:38:17,740
She just turned around.

4674
03:38:18,160 --> 03:38:19,120
She can do that?

4675
03:38:21,660 --> 03:38:23,340
Wait, is there anything back there?

4676
03:38:23,660 --> 03:38:25,000
Is there collectible back there?

4677
03:38:25,160 --> 03:38:25,300
Nah.

4678
03:38:30,250 --> 03:38:31,470
I just want to be sure.

4679
03:38:33,270 --> 03:38:33,710
Okay.

4680
03:38:33,710 --> 03:38:34,370
I'll go in.

4681
03:38:36,390 --> 03:38:37,890
Yeah, I was going to say, she turned around.

4682
03:38:38,050 --> 03:38:38,770
That's like cheating.

4683
03:38:40,050 --> 03:38:41,030
I'm not going to...

4684
03:38:41,030 --> 03:38:41,310
Okay.

4685
03:38:47,490 --> 03:38:48,170
I knew it.

4686
03:38:48,250 --> 03:38:48,910
I knew it.

4687
03:38:49,110 --> 03:38:50,910
I knew there was nothing back there.

4688
03:38:51,350 --> 03:38:52,490
I fucking knew it.

4689
03:38:52,490 --> 03:38:54,090
I knew you guys lied.

4690
03:38:56,590 --> 03:38:58,350
Wait, she turned around again.

4691
03:39:01,230 --> 03:39:02,290
It's cheating.

4692
03:39:10,430 --> 03:39:10,970
Yeah.

4693
03:39:10,970 --> 03:39:10,990
Okay.

4694
03:39:11,930 --> 03:39:12,650
Ah!

4695
03:39:13,970 --> 03:39:15,010
Fucking hell.

4696
03:39:16,270 --> 03:39:16,810
Jesus.

4697
03:39:17,550 --> 03:39:18,910
Oh my god, it's mail time.

4698
03:39:19,490 --> 03:39:21,550
I didn't realize it's mail time.

4699
03:39:23,550 --> 03:39:24,950
Goddamn mail time.

4700
03:39:27,550 --> 03:39:29,050
Where do I do with this?

4701
03:39:37,010 --> 03:39:38,230
Where do I put this?

4702
03:39:39,690 --> 03:39:40,410
Hello.

4703
03:39:45,130 --> 03:39:45,890
Oh, it's right here.

4704
03:39:46,650 --> 03:39:48,710
Okay, I got worried that...

4705
03:39:48,710 --> 03:39:50,110
Oh, I can open the door now.

4706
03:39:51,010 --> 03:39:52,890
Okay, I feel like she's gonna run over me.

4707
03:39:57,800 --> 03:39:59,600
I need her to go around from here.

4708
03:40:01,280 --> 03:40:02,620
I need her to go around.

4709
03:40:02,880 --> 03:40:04,080
I feel like she'll run over me.

4710
03:40:04,980 --> 03:40:07,340
Yeah, and the PC had like open big door.

4711
03:40:10,750 --> 03:40:11,950
Where is she going?

4712
03:40:17,040 --> 03:40:19,140
The pathway is so random now.

4713
03:40:20,080 --> 03:40:20,280
Okay.

4714
03:40:21,480 --> 03:40:23,020
Now I can open the door.

4715
03:40:24,020 --> 03:40:24,660
Here we go.

4716
03:40:25,880 --> 03:40:26,480
Nice.

4717
03:40:28,000 --> 03:40:29,780
Doesn't she recognize me?

4718
03:40:29,860 --> 03:40:30,780
The foreign object?

4719
03:40:31,140 --> 03:40:32,940
She can literally scan me right now.

4720
03:40:35,800 --> 03:40:37,220
Wait, is she broken?

4721
03:40:41,280 --> 03:40:42,240
What's going on?

4722
03:40:51,350 --> 03:40:52,110
Wait a minute.

4723
03:40:59,140 --> 03:41:00,500
She can do that?

4724
03:41:10,860 --> 03:41:12,320
I don't want to take my medicine.

4725
03:41:12,540 --> 03:41:13,680
I don't want to take my medicine.

4726
03:41:21,860 --> 03:41:22,760
I don't want to take my medicine.

4727
03:41:22,760 --> 03:41:23,260
The mimic got her?

4728
03:41:24,160 --> 03:41:24,940
What the fuck?

4729
03:41:27,160 --> 03:41:28,340
Oh, I got meds.

4730
03:41:31,280 --> 03:41:31,780
Okay.

4731
03:41:33,200 --> 03:41:34,860
Okay, I think the mimic got her.

4732
03:41:36,960 --> 03:41:38,980
I don't want to take my meds.

4733
03:41:45,800 --> 03:41:46,460
I don't want to take my meds.

4734
03:41:46,460 --> 03:41:47,000
I don't think she saw me.

4735
03:41:47,940 --> 03:41:51,060
Ladies, if I take my meds, the voices will disappear.

4736
03:41:52,280 --> 03:41:53,800
My chat will disappear.

4737
03:42:01,120 --> 03:42:01,560
Recycle.

4738
03:42:02,940 --> 03:42:03,380
Recycle.

4739
03:42:04,780 --> 03:42:05,220
Recycle.

4740
03:42:05,600 --> 03:42:06,700
No, she destroyed.

4741
03:42:15,390 --> 03:42:16,470
I don't think she saw me.

4742
03:42:16,570 --> 03:42:17,550
Oh, thank God she's stupid.

4743
03:42:20,970 --> 03:42:23,430
How would I get back seated if I take my meds?

4744
03:42:26,650 --> 03:42:28,290
Medical personnel only.

4745
03:42:28,770 --> 03:42:30,570
Okay, I need her to like, get through the...

4746
03:42:30,570 --> 03:42:32,070
Like, where did her feet go?

4747
03:42:32,590 --> 03:42:33,870
Wait, is she wearing heels now?

4748
03:42:35,490 --> 03:42:37,170
Oh my God, it's just gone.

4749
03:42:38,350 --> 03:42:40,370
But she literally just like, got up.

4750
03:42:47,080 --> 03:42:48,300
I can't...

4751
03:42:48,300 --> 03:42:49,060
I can't...

4752
03:42:49,060 --> 03:42:49,620
I can't power it up.

4753
03:42:50,340 --> 03:42:51,900
She's literally capping me.

4754
03:42:54,720 --> 03:42:55,820
Please leave.

4755
03:42:56,300 --> 03:42:57,320
Please leave.

4756
03:42:57,720 --> 03:42:58,160
Please.

4757
03:43:01,940 --> 03:43:02,320
Please.

4758
03:43:02,640 --> 03:43:04,840
I just want to crank that soldier boy.

4759
03:43:10,220 --> 03:43:13,340
Please let me crank that soldier boy!

4760
03:43:13,660 --> 03:43:15,000
It's right there!

4761
03:43:23,240 --> 03:43:25,140
That arm using the bathroom.

4762
03:43:25,400 --> 03:43:27,340
She's just gonna capped me for a bell.

4763
03:43:27,480 --> 03:43:28,340
I'm using the bathroom.

4764
03:43:29,060 --> 03:43:30,160
No disassemble.

4765
03:43:41,800 --> 03:43:42,480
Error.

4766
03:43:53,960 --> 03:43:56,880
I will try turning it off and on again.

4767
03:44:06,790 --> 03:44:09,010
We need to run some tests.

4768
03:44:19,640 --> 03:44:20,720
Fix, fix, fix.

4769
03:44:32,360 --> 03:44:33,820
You need a lobotomy.

4770
03:44:44,620 --> 03:44:45,940
Next task.

4771
03:44:57,230 --> 03:44:59,190
Time to take your medicine.

4772
03:45:06,610 --> 03:45:07,790
Back for real.

4773
03:45:07,890 --> 03:45:08,650
Is she still there?

4774
03:45:08,810 --> 03:45:09,830
She's still there.

4775
03:45:10,090 --> 03:45:10,950
Like, I...

4776
03:45:12,730 --> 03:45:13,410
Please.

4777
03:45:14,230 --> 03:45:16,610
I just want to crank it.

4778
03:45:17,810 --> 03:45:20,470
Let me crank that soldier boy.

4779
03:45:22,810 --> 03:45:23,490
Scanning.

4780
03:45:26,740 --> 03:45:27,200
Okay.

4781
03:45:40,170 --> 03:45:40,850
Okay.

4782
03:45:41,570 --> 03:45:42,530
Please, I don't need a...

4783
03:45:42,530 --> 03:45:43,430
You can't fix me.

4784
03:45:53,350 --> 03:45:53,830
Okay.

4785
03:46:00,250 --> 03:46:01,030
Here we go.

4786
03:46:01,230 --> 03:46:02,110
We did it.

4787
03:46:03,050 --> 03:46:03,530
True!

4788
03:46:05,370 --> 03:46:06,670
Wait, do I go down?

4789
03:46:07,430 --> 03:46:07,870
I don't know.

4790
03:46:08,130 --> 03:46:09,790
No, down is not up.

4791
03:46:12,490 --> 03:46:12,970
Okay.

4792
03:46:13,290 --> 03:46:13,830
Here we go.

4793
03:46:14,130 --> 03:46:14,970
We got out of there.

4794
03:46:16,370 --> 03:46:17,630
Kiwi, thank you for the super chat.

4795
03:46:17,730 --> 03:46:18,210
Thank you, thank you.

4796
03:46:18,310 --> 03:46:18,550
Thank you.

4797
03:46:18,550 --> 03:46:19,950
Thank you for the super chat.

4798
03:46:20,070 --> 03:46:20,830
Thank you, thank you.

4799
03:46:21,090 --> 03:46:22,230
Alright, now we're safe.

4800
03:46:23,270 --> 03:46:23,990
Alright, what's this?

4801
03:46:27,210 --> 03:46:27,650
Uh...

4802
03:46:27,650 --> 03:46:29,130
Access Doll Hospital.

4803
03:46:29,870 --> 03:46:31,290
I don't know what that is.

4804
03:46:32,270 --> 03:46:32,710
Oh.

4805
03:46:33,570 --> 03:46:34,390
That's fire.

4806
03:46:36,670 --> 03:46:37,830
What about cards?

4807
03:46:40,470 --> 03:46:41,030
What about cards?

4808
03:46:41,030 --> 03:46:41,750
Oh, it's time cards.

4809
03:46:42,610 --> 03:46:44,830
Oh, Barbara Chris Milton.

4810
03:46:45,490 --> 03:46:46,970
Isn't Milton a character?

4811
03:46:47,330 --> 03:46:48,890
Red flag, what did he do?

4812
03:46:49,470 --> 03:46:51,630
Come on, I'm pretty sure Milton's a nice guy.

4813
03:46:52,630 --> 03:46:54,710
Isn't he, like, from the FNAF universe?

4814
03:46:58,520 --> 03:47:00,000
Into the pit we go.

4815
03:47:00,820 --> 03:47:01,520
Oh, there's more mail.

4816
03:47:03,020 --> 03:47:03,560
Mail time.

4817
03:47:06,900 --> 03:47:08,480
Yay, I got mail!

4818
03:47:09,840 --> 03:47:10,820
You got mail.

4819
03:47:17,550 --> 03:47:18,450
Okay, where...

4820
03:47:18,450 --> 03:47:19,290
Where am I?

4821
03:47:19,490 --> 03:47:20,270
Oh, no signal.

4822
03:47:20,430 --> 03:47:20,850
Never mind.

4823
03:47:21,050 --> 03:47:22,090
I guess I'll never know.

4824
03:47:24,750 --> 03:47:25,650
Alright, I swear.

4825
03:47:25,890 --> 03:47:29,890
If I hear that song one more time, I'm going to tear that dolly off her hinges.

4826
03:47:30,190 --> 03:47:32,490
I have no clue how much longer I can take it here.

4827
03:47:34,750 --> 03:47:38,450
All personnel are expected to meet their energy quotas before returning home.

4828
03:47:38,630 --> 03:47:39,970
No exceptions.

4829
03:47:40,530 --> 03:47:41,230
Alright, Milton.

4830
03:47:45,160 --> 03:47:46,460
How are you gonna know?

4831
03:47:46,900 --> 03:47:48,120
Limbs replaced...

4832
03:47:48,120 --> 03:47:48,600
Oh, look!

4833
03:47:48,660 --> 03:47:49,800
They can replace limbs!

4834
03:47:50,160 --> 03:47:52,000
What a great place to work at.

4835
03:47:52,940 --> 03:47:53,480
See?

4836
03:47:56,460 --> 03:47:57,360
Look at that.

4837
03:47:57,360 --> 03:47:58,320
Even if you...

4838
03:47:58,320 --> 03:47:59,180
You lose your hand.

4839
03:47:59,180 --> 03:48:01,420
At least you'll get a sick cool robot hand.

4840
03:48:04,200 --> 03:48:05,200
For free?

4841
03:48:05,900 --> 03:48:09,460
Yeah, who needs regular hands when I get...

4842
03:48:09,460 --> 03:48:10,580
Robo hands.

4843
03:48:17,610 --> 03:48:18,970
She sounds dangerous.

4844
03:48:21,030 --> 03:48:22,330
Is she getting closer?

4845
03:48:24,210 --> 03:48:25,570
There's so many levers.

4846
03:48:25,790 --> 03:48:27,430
I'm just turning on all the levers.

4847
03:48:27,430 --> 03:48:28,570
I don't know what they do.

4848
03:48:28,670 --> 03:48:31,610
I am unable to access your service manual.

4849
03:48:31,930 --> 03:48:34,710
Now no one will make fun of my spaghetti arms.

4850
03:48:36,090 --> 03:48:36,930
What is that?

4851
03:48:37,090 --> 03:48:37,830
What is that?

4852
03:48:43,960 --> 03:48:45,500
I have no idea where she's going.

4853
03:48:46,660 --> 03:48:48,220
I have no map sense.

4854
03:48:52,680 --> 03:48:53,400
What's this?

4855
03:48:55,480 --> 03:48:56,720
Oh, it's for the chute.

4856
03:48:56,860 --> 03:48:57,660
But where's the chute?

4857
03:48:59,200 --> 03:48:59,920
Oh, that's...

4858
03:48:59,920 --> 03:49:00,880
No, that's not the chute.

4859
03:49:01,420 --> 03:49:02,300
Wait, where's the chute?

4860
03:49:04,200 --> 03:49:05,000
Oh, that's...

4861
03:49:05,000 --> 03:49:05,840
It's right next to me.

4862
03:49:06,560 --> 03:49:07,140
There we go.

4863
03:49:08,500 --> 03:49:10,460
Okay, so now I have to find other trash.

4864
03:49:11,840 --> 03:49:12,680
Oh, but mail.

4865
03:49:13,220 --> 03:49:13,940
Mail's important.

4866
03:49:14,640 --> 03:49:15,580
Gotta check my mail.

4867
03:49:19,660 --> 03:49:21,660
We're gonna find more trash.

4868
03:49:28,580 --> 03:49:29,000
Okay.

4869
03:49:35,440 --> 03:49:37,420
She just opened the door?

4870
03:49:41,700 --> 03:49:42,540
What?

4871
03:49:43,260 --> 03:49:43,700
What?

4872
03:49:44,640 --> 03:49:45,060
Wait.

4873
03:49:46,160 --> 03:49:47,600
Was that supposed to happen?

4874
03:49:49,760 --> 03:49:50,840
Wait.

4875
03:49:52,880 --> 03:49:54,320
She has thumbs?

4876
03:49:59,940 --> 03:50:00,480
No.

4877
03:50:01,720 --> 03:50:02,180
Oh, no.

4878
03:50:03,040 --> 03:50:05,460
AI is getting stronger.

4879
03:50:07,960 --> 03:50:08,780
What the?

4880
03:50:09,940 --> 03:50:11,400
Since when?

4881
03:50:11,720 --> 03:50:12,260
No!

4882
03:50:12,700 --> 03:50:14,660
She has a possible thumbs!

4883
03:50:22,890 --> 03:50:24,990
She is learning?!

4884
03:50:26,210 --> 03:50:27,190
The horror!

4885
03:50:34,660 --> 03:50:35,820
Oh, my God.

4886
03:50:37,420 --> 03:50:39,080
I can just stand behind her, right?

4887
03:50:39,840 --> 03:50:40,780
Actually, I can go...

4888
03:50:40,780 --> 03:50:41,800
Oh, she's going right...

4889
03:50:41,800 --> 03:50:42,280
Left side.

4890
03:50:43,280 --> 03:50:44,420
I just need to go right.

4891
03:50:48,570 --> 03:50:49,710
I need to grab that.

4892
03:50:57,710 --> 03:50:58,110
Oh.

4893
03:50:58,590 --> 03:50:59,470
She didn't see me.

4894
03:51:04,520 --> 03:51:06,480
Okay, but where is the other...

4895
03:51:06,480 --> 03:51:07,080
Garbage?

4896
03:51:07,440 --> 03:51:08,660
There has to be more garbage!

4897
03:51:08,940 --> 03:51:10,000
To the right side.

4898
03:51:10,960 --> 03:51:11,400
I think.

4899
03:51:13,900 --> 03:51:15,220
I didn't see any garbage.

4900
03:51:16,240 --> 03:51:18,440
My God, this is a lot bigger than I expected.

4901
03:51:18,840 --> 03:51:19,400
This is...

4902
03:51:19,400 --> 03:51:20,420
This is a lot bigger.

4903
03:51:20,760 --> 03:51:22,200
Oh, this is a lot bigger.

4904
03:51:25,500 --> 03:51:27,420
Oh, there's a lot more stuff here than I thought.

4905
03:51:27,420 --> 03:51:28,320
There is a...

4906
03:51:28,320 --> 03:51:28,580
Oh!

4907
03:51:28,900 --> 03:51:30,040
There is a lot more stuff here.

4908
03:51:31,300 --> 03:51:32,360
I have an idea.

4909
03:51:33,200 --> 03:51:33,940
It's time.

4910
03:51:34,540 --> 03:51:36,740
Surely, this time, they won't...

4911
03:51:38,040 --> 03:51:38,560
Surely...

4912
03:51:39,380 --> 03:51:41,660
Surely, it won't phase through this time.

4913
03:51:42,880 --> 03:51:43,840
Oh, man, though.

4914
03:51:48,140 --> 03:51:49,060
Unlock this.

4915
03:51:50,180 --> 03:51:50,820
Oh, wait.

4916
03:51:50,900 --> 03:51:51,180
I don't...

4917
03:51:51,180 --> 03:51:51,460
Oh, wait.

4918
03:51:52,700 --> 03:51:54,080
I do this first.

4919
03:51:59,050 --> 03:51:59,730
Alright.

4920
03:52:00,970 --> 03:52:03,730
It's been so long since I did this one puzzle.

4921
03:52:03,870 --> 03:52:04,210
Wait, what?

4922
03:52:05,070 --> 03:52:06,150
Wait, no puzzle?

4923
03:52:06,510 --> 03:52:07,510
No puzzle!

4924
03:52:08,990 --> 03:52:09,670
Nevermind.

4925
03:52:15,960 --> 03:52:16,640
Um...

4926
03:52:16,640 --> 03:52:17,420
Okay.

4927
03:52:24,040 --> 03:52:24,720
Okay.

4928
03:52:25,040 --> 03:52:25,380
What?

4929
03:52:26,740 --> 03:52:27,420
Okay.

4930
03:52:27,820 --> 03:52:28,180
Wait.

4931
03:52:29,020 --> 03:52:30,060
Excuse me?

4932
03:52:33,000 --> 03:52:35,500
What happens when I touch the corrupted thing?

4933
03:52:38,960 --> 03:52:40,300
Oh, I have to make it...

4934
03:52:40,300 --> 03:52:40,700
I forgot.

4935
03:52:40,960 --> 03:52:43,000
I have to make it all fucking ones.

4936
03:52:43,240 --> 03:52:44,920
Why do I keep making them zero?

4937
03:52:45,280 --> 03:52:46,520
I don't know!

4938
03:52:49,800 --> 03:52:51,080
I don't...

4939
03:52:51,080 --> 03:52:52,920
I can't help it!

4940
03:52:53,920 --> 03:52:56,160
I can't help it, guys!

4941
03:52:56,800 --> 03:52:59,080
I just wanna keep making them zero.

4942
03:52:59,460 --> 03:53:01,100
I don't know why.

4943
03:53:01,940 --> 03:53:03,600
I have a problem.

4944
03:53:04,340 --> 03:53:04,700
I...

4945
03:53:09,520 --> 03:53:10,700
I just...

4946
03:53:10,700 --> 03:53:12,880
Zero's just the better number!

4947
03:53:17,200 --> 03:53:17,620
Alright.

4948
03:53:19,980 --> 03:53:22,520
My brain goes to zero first.

4949
03:53:23,520 --> 03:53:25,240
I can't help it!

4950
03:53:25,520 --> 03:53:26,940
I can't help it!

4951
03:53:28,750 --> 03:53:30,350
No thoughts!

4952
03:53:30,650 --> 03:53:31,230
Head zero!

4953
03:53:31,690 --> 03:53:34,310
Johnny, thank you for the super chat!

4954
03:53:36,490 --> 03:53:37,070
The fuck?

4955
03:53:43,910 --> 03:53:44,710
Recycle!

4956
03:53:45,550 --> 03:53:46,470
Recycle!

4957
03:53:46,470 --> 03:53:47,090
Recycle!

4958
03:53:47,810 --> 03:53:49,950
I don't wanna recycle!

4959
03:53:51,650 --> 03:53:53,870
What if I don't wanna?

4960
03:53:53,870 --> 03:53:54,550
I don't wanna...

4961
03:53:58,870 --> 03:54:01,150
I don't wanna recycle!

4962
03:54:07,910 --> 03:54:08,410
Okay.

4963
03:54:14,460 --> 03:54:16,080
There she is.

4964
03:54:23,680 --> 03:54:25,680
I'll let her go out more.

4965
03:54:31,000 --> 03:54:32,000
Okay.

4966
03:54:33,440 --> 03:54:35,080
There must be like...

4967
03:54:35,080 --> 03:54:36,380
I'm pretty sure...

4968
03:54:36,380 --> 03:54:37,200
There has to be...

4969
03:54:37,880 --> 03:54:38,920
At least...

4970
03:54:38,920 --> 03:54:39,780
One more.

4971
03:54:40,760 --> 03:54:41,620
Oh my god.

4972
03:54:41,720 --> 03:54:43,020
There was a chute right there.

4973
03:54:44,320 --> 03:54:45,500
There's one right there.

4974
03:54:49,330 --> 03:54:50,270
Where is she?

4975
03:54:56,080 --> 03:54:56,600
Like...

4976
03:54:56,600 --> 03:54:57,260
Oh, I see her.

4977
03:55:03,510 --> 03:55:04,550
What if I just...

4978
03:55:04,550 --> 03:55:05,210
Where's that door?

4979
03:55:09,530 --> 03:55:10,710
Oh, I have an idea.

4980
03:55:11,110 --> 03:55:11,850
I have an idea.

4981
03:55:15,470 --> 03:55:16,810
Send to furnace.

4982
03:55:17,370 --> 03:55:18,010
There you.

4983
03:55:19,650 --> 03:55:20,530
Get faded.

4984
03:55:28,720 --> 03:55:29,800
What is over here?

4985
03:55:30,540 --> 03:55:31,080
Wait, nothing.

4986
03:55:32,340 --> 03:55:33,520
There's nothing at all.

4987
03:55:36,140 --> 03:55:37,480
Oh wait, I was just here.

4988
03:55:41,420 --> 03:55:42,220
I was here.

4989
03:55:45,290 --> 03:55:46,430
I don't know where to go.

4990
03:55:46,430 --> 03:55:47,390
I'm a little lost.

4991
03:55:47,570 --> 03:55:48,190
Not gonna lie.

4992
03:55:51,670 --> 03:55:52,110
Oh!

4993
03:56:00,560 --> 03:56:03,180
Or me or me not be just a little lost, guys.

4994
03:56:11,340 --> 03:56:12,360
Where am I?

4995
03:56:14,740 --> 03:56:16,080
Wait, how do I get out?

4996
03:56:16,920 --> 03:56:17,360
Wait!

4997
03:56:22,340 --> 03:56:23,980
Was there a lever back there?

4998
03:56:33,270 --> 03:56:34,350
How do I get back?

4999
03:56:34,350 --> 03:56:36,790
I don't remember how I got back home.

5000
03:56:40,520 --> 03:56:42,400
Did I open that lever yet?

5001
03:56:44,260 --> 03:56:45,180
Can't tell.

5002
03:56:48,000 --> 03:56:50,020
I don't know if I found all the garbage.

5003
03:56:51,980 --> 03:56:52,620
Recycle.

5004
03:56:53,520 --> 03:56:55,700
I don't remember anymore, guys.

5005
03:56:56,220 --> 03:56:57,520
It's all a fucking blur.

5006
03:57:01,080 --> 03:57:01,600
Recycle.

5007
03:57:02,360 --> 03:57:03,320
Reduce, reuse.

5008
03:57:07,880 --> 03:57:08,960
God, I hate that.

5009
03:57:09,620 --> 03:57:11,420
I'm gonna make sure there's no more levers.

5010
03:57:12,540 --> 03:57:13,060
Okay.

5011
03:57:13,260 --> 03:57:15,020
I gotta figure out how to get back home.

5012
03:57:19,750 --> 03:57:20,930
Is the shoe full?

5013
03:57:27,560 --> 03:57:29,080
Okay, shoe's not full.

5014
03:57:29,940 --> 03:57:30,680
What the fuck?

5015
03:57:31,260 --> 03:57:33,120
Oh, there was trash in that room.

5016
03:57:33,200 --> 03:57:34,360
I didn't see!

5017
03:57:38,220 --> 03:57:39,460
I missed it!

5018
03:57:42,340 --> 03:57:42,900
Oh, God.

5019
03:57:44,280 --> 03:57:45,260
She's so strong.

5020
03:57:45,660 --> 03:57:46,320
Oh, my God.

5021
03:57:46,340 --> 03:57:47,220
And she has thumbs.

5022
03:57:47,380 --> 03:57:48,040
I see them.

5023
03:57:48,220 --> 03:57:49,680
I see the thumbs.

5024
03:57:51,120 --> 03:57:52,460
Is there any more in here?

5025
03:57:53,040 --> 03:57:54,460
Before I go back in that room?

5026
03:57:56,120 --> 03:57:57,180
I just wanna be sure.

5027
03:58:01,360 --> 03:58:02,240
Please don't open the door.

5028
03:58:02,380 --> 03:58:03,260
Please don't open the door.

5029
03:58:03,260 --> 03:58:04,320
Please don't open the door.

5030
03:58:07,580 --> 03:58:08,640
She didn't see me.

5031
03:58:09,120 --> 03:58:09,700
Oh, thank God.

5032
03:58:12,900 --> 03:58:13,880
Oh, thank God.

5033
03:58:15,840 --> 03:58:17,860
I didn't see the chains cause I'm blind.

5034
03:58:24,400 --> 03:58:26,540
So, there was one in here.

5035
03:58:26,880 --> 03:58:27,840
Oh, my God.

5036
03:58:27,880 --> 03:58:28,660
It was right here.

5037
03:58:28,980 --> 03:58:30,560
It's right here all along.

5038
03:58:32,940 --> 03:58:33,500
Okay.

5039
03:58:33,680 --> 03:58:34,740
We're missing one more.

5040
03:58:34,740 --> 03:58:36,780
Where could the last trash be?

5041
03:58:45,900 --> 03:58:46,880
She's coming over.

5042
03:58:49,000 --> 03:58:51,220
She's coming over very slowly.

5043
03:59:00,770 --> 03:59:01,930
Where is it?

5044
03:59:06,950 --> 03:59:07,850
Oh, my God.

5045
03:59:07,910 --> 03:59:09,130
It has to be back here.

5046
03:59:09,590 --> 03:59:11,410
It has to be back here.

5047
03:59:11,970 --> 03:59:13,490
It's somewhere here.

5048
03:59:13,490 --> 03:59:15,050
Take your medicine.

5049
03:59:20,260 --> 03:59:22,930
Is this what the trash man does every day?

5050
03:59:26,680 --> 03:59:28,340
Is that right there?

5051
03:59:28,480 --> 03:59:29,080
Is that it?

5052
03:59:29,440 --> 03:59:31,160
Is that one thing just lying?

5053
03:59:31,480 --> 03:59:33,740
Is that thing in the middle of the ground the trash?

5054
03:59:34,200 --> 03:59:35,040
I can't tell.

5055
03:59:37,600 --> 03:59:40,900
Don't tell me it's been lying down there the entire time.

5056
03:59:41,620 --> 03:59:42,740
I can't get it.

5057
03:59:45,620 --> 03:59:47,420
It's just been sitting there.

5058
03:59:50,300 --> 03:59:51,180
Oh, my God.

5059
03:59:51,380 --> 03:59:51,940
No, it's not.

5060
03:59:52,260 --> 03:59:52,860
It's not.

5061
03:59:53,000 --> 03:59:53,220
It's not.

5062
03:59:53,360 --> 03:59:53,720
Thank God.

5063
03:59:56,260 --> 03:59:56,720
Okay.

5064
03:59:57,440 --> 03:59:57,980
Maybe there's one.

5065
03:59:58,100 --> 03:59:58,540
Oh, my God.

5066
03:59:58,640 --> 03:59:59,020
It's right here.

5067
03:59:59,400 --> 04:00:00,940
It was instead right next to us.

5068
04:00:11,000 --> 04:00:12,040
Oh, does it open?

5069
04:00:14,520 --> 04:00:15,520
Time to go down.

5070
04:00:16,240 --> 04:00:16,960
Down I go.

5071
04:00:22,700 --> 04:00:23,500
Lever time.

5072
04:00:23,500 --> 04:00:23,600
Oh, man.

5073
04:00:26,790 --> 04:00:27,470
Oh.

5074
04:00:28,890 --> 04:00:29,890
Lever time.

5075
04:00:31,450 --> 04:00:32,390
That's right.

5076
04:00:32,650 --> 04:00:33,990
What you gonna do now?

5077
04:00:34,530 --> 04:00:35,650
You can't jump.

5078
04:00:36,050 --> 04:00:38,090
I know you can't jump.

5079
04:00:38,810 --> 04:00:39,770
That's right.

5080
04:00:40,070 --> 04:00:42,410
Just briskly walk in front of it.

5081
04:00:44,490 --> 04:00:45,650
That's right.

5082
04:00:46,590 --> 04:00:47,850
Get down in there.

5083
04:00:49,590 --> 04:00:52,010
Your legs are just as skinny as mine.

5084
04:00:56,710 --> 04:00:58,430
That's right, stick legs.

5085
04:00:59,030 --> 04:01:02,030
I know your weakness because I am you.

5086
04:01:04,590 --> 04:01:05,230
Recycling.

5087
04:01:06,630 --> 04:01:09,330
As coined by Edwin in 19...

5088
04:01:09,610 --> 04:01:12,770
We never recycled until Edwin learned how to.

5089
04:01:13,770 --> 04:01:14,290
Go here.

5090
04:01:18,900 --> 04:01:20,340
Oh, that's where she died.

5091
04:01:22,260 --> 04:01:23,780
Wait, do I go here?

5092
04:01:30,410 --> 04:01:31,650
Do I go here?

5093
04:01:33,630 --> 04:01:35,170
There's another door right there.

5094
04:01:36,090 --> 04:01:37,490
Alright, before I... it's here?

5095
04:01:37,630 --> 04:01:37,790
Okay.

5096
04:01:39,950 --> 04:01:41,050
I have to make sure.

5097
04:01:41,310 --> 04:01:43,270
There's so many pathways that I'm getting lost.

5098
04:01:45,670 --> 04:01:47,190
Oh, there was a Mr. Helpful.

5099
04:01:50,350 --> 04:01:51,050
Oh, yay!

5100
04:01:51,050 --> 04:01:51,170
Yay!

5101
04:02:00,030 --> 04:02:02,450
I didn't even know Mr. Helpful was here!

5102
04:02:03,430 --> 04:02:05,350
Say hello to Dolly!

5103
04:02:05,550 --> 04:02:06,150
Hi, Dolly!

5104
04:02:07,030 --> 04:02:07,330
Oh.

5105
04:02:07,490 --> 04:02:11,590
Now that the Dolly system is up and running, you can stop collecting time cards.

5106
04:02:12,090 --> 04:02:12,510
Alright.

5107
04:02:12,510 --> 04:02:16,530
She can work an unlimited number of hours without breaks or mealtime.

5108
04:02:16,570 --> 04:02:18,170
Oh my god, they're taking our jobs.

5109
04:02:19,670 --> 04:02:22,270
Dolly also can't be injured or need a sick day.

5110
04:02:22,890 --> 04:02:24,970
Just imagine the money we'll save.

5111
04:02:26,470 --> 04:02:27,730
Wait, where's he...?

5112
04:02:27,730 --> 04:02:31,770
She can begin laying off the sorting staff as more Dolly tracks are installed throughout the lower levels.

5113
04:02:34,310 --> 04:02:34,830
Eh?

5114
04:02:35,470 --> 04:02:36,510
Well, she's dead.

5115
04:02:36,690 --> 04:02:37,250
I killed her.

5116
04:02:38,190 --> 04:02:39,150
Oh, there we go.

5117
04:02:39,270 --> 04:02:40,090
Power reactor core.

5118
04:02:43,510 --> 04:02:44,670
That's Oswald.

5119
04:02:45,050 --> 04:02:47,590
Before we... Before Mickey Mouse was born.

5120
04:02:55,990 --> 04:02:57,690
We're taking our jobs.

5121
04:02:59,250 --> 04:03:00,610
Not our jobs.

5122
04:03:01,790 --> 04:03:03,410
I feel so safe here.

5123
04:03:06,770 --> 04:03:08,250
Next to all this lava!

5124
04:03:09,950 --> 04:03:10,830
The lava...

5125
04:03:10,830 --> 04:03:12,110
Ch-ch-ch-ch-chicken...

5126
04:03:12,110 --> 04:03:15,390
Seas lava chicken, ba-da-na-na-na-na-na-na...

5127
04:03:15,390 --> 04:03:18,170
Duh-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

5128
04:03:23,430 --> 04:03:24,550
It didn't go right.

5129
04:03:25,490 --> 04:03:25,930
Whoa!

5130
04:03:28,290 --> 04:03:28,730
Oh...!

5131
04:03:29,510 --> 04:03:30,310
Wait, what?

5132
04:03:32,270 --> 04:03:32,710
Dolly?!

5133
04:03:32,710 --> 04:03:33,470
Oh.

5134
04:03:33,470 --> 04:03:33,910
My.

5135
04:03:34,150 --> 04:03:34,870
G-O-D!

5136
04:03:36,410 --> 04:03:37,210
Oh my god.

5137
04:03:37,390 --> 04:03:37,750
Oh my god.

5138
04:03:37,790 --> 04:03:38,290
Get me out of here.

5139
04:03:39,110 --> 04:03:42,690
I was joking, Dali.

5140
04:03:43,050 --> 04:03:45,630
You can take as many jobs as you want.

5141
04:03:48,150 --> 04:03:50,350
You can take all the jobs.

5142
04:03:50,970 --> 04:03:52,150
Work for free.

5143
04:03:53,030 --> 04:03:56,470
I... I

5144
04:04:01,000 --> 04:04:02,740
didn't say she could take my job.

5145
04:04:03,500 --> 04:04:07,560
Look, I meant it when I said she could take my job.

5146
04:04:11,700 --> 04:04:12,460
Okay.

5147
04:04:13,100 --> 04:04:14,440
I saw... I don't know.

5148
04:04:14,540 --> 04:04:15,620
I followed them.

5149
04:04:16,440 --> 04:04:16,960
Wrong way.

5150
04:04:17,660 --> 04:04:19,060
I... I... Wrong way.

5151
04:04:23,120 --> 04:04:24,280
Oh no.

5152
04:04:25,040 --> 04:04:33,340
That is like... 9... There is like 9... 10... Like a million triangles in Dali right now.

5153
04:04:34,620 --> 04:04:35,380
I...

5154
04:04:35,380 --> 04:04:38,360
My intrusive... Do a flip!

5155
04:04:39,360 --> 04:04:40,560
I'm sorry, guys.

5156
04:04:40,760 --> 04:04:42,700
I really wanted to do a flip.

5157
04:04:43,280 --> 04:04:44,500
Where the fuck do I go?

5158
04:04:45,100 --> 04:04:45,960
After this?

5159
04:04:47,240 --> 04:04:47,720
Oh!

5160
04:04:48,080 --> 04:04:48,580
That way!

5161
04:04:49,340 --> 04:04:49,440
Oh!

5162
04:04:50,160 --> 04:04:52,680
Instead of dying, I could have went that way.

5163
04:04:54,200 --> 04:04:56,100
There's a lot of polygons.

5164
04:04:59,360 --> 04:05:01,020
Okay, and then I'll walk that way.

5165
04:05:02,620 --> 04:05:03,800
Wait, that's illegal.

5166
04:05:05,640 --> 04:05:07,420
I tried... What the fuck?

5167
04:05:07,800 --> 04:05:10,640
I worked so hard trying to go there.

5168
04:05:13,520 --> 04:05:16,800
She can't just like... Teleports in front of me.

5169
04:05:19,020 --> 04:05:19,580
Alright.

5170
04:05:20,800 --> 04:05:21,640
I can't get it.

5171
04:05:22,820 --> 04:05:23,200
Nice.

5172
04:05:24,000 --> 04:05:24,920
I can't get it.

5173
04:05:26,800 --> 04:05:27,880
Do I get sliced?

5174
04:05:29,140 --> 04:05:30,320
Oh, no I don't.

5175
04:05:30,560 --> 04:05:30,700
Okay.

5176
04:05:30,700 --> 04:05:34,060
Sorry, my truth to thoughts were still going at it.

5177
04:05:39,020 --> 04:05:40,320
Okay, that's not fair.

5178
04:05:44,180 --> 04:05:45,760
Did she see me here?

5179
04:05:48,100 --> 04:05:50,120
But she's still like alive.

5180
04:05:51,200 --> 04:05:53,640
That should have burned her processors by now.

5181
04:05:55,160 --> 04:05:57,080
Is her processor still working?

5182
04:06:03,200 --> 04:06:04,240
Holy fuck.

5183
04:06:08,540 --> 04:06:09,620
Oh my god.

5184
04:06:12,060 --> 04:06:13,280
Oh, is she blind?

5185
04:06:13,800 --> 04:06:14,840
Oh, she...

5186
04:06:14,840 --> 04:06:15,920
Guys, she was not blind.

5187
04:06:16,200 --> 04:06:16,520
Guys!

5188
04:06:16,740 --> 04:06:17,040
Guys!

5189
04:06:17,040 --> 04:06:18,260
She was not blind, guys!

5190
04:06:18,640 --> 04:06:19,760
She was not blind!

5191
04:06:32,330 --> 04:06:34,490
Okay, okay, okay.

5192
04:06:34,490 --> 04:06:35,210
No, no.

5193
04:06:35,210 --> 04:06:35,830
No, no.

5194
04:06:36,270 --> 04:06:37,030
She's not...

5195
04:06:37,030 --> 04:06:38,190
She's not blind.

5196
04:06:47,250 --> 04:06:49,110
Come on, she...

5197
04:06:49,110 --> 04:06:51,190
Okay, okay, I just...

5198
04:06:52,790 --> 04:06:54,150
I just go this way.

5199
04:06:57,740 --> 04:06:58,540
Okay.

5200
04:06:58,980 --> 04:06:59,500
Okay.

5201
04:07:00,100 --> 04:07:00,460
Okay.

5202
04:07:01,100 --> 04:07:02,440
Everything is fine.

5203
04:07:03,620 --> 04:07:05,160
Everything is fine.

5204
04:07:05,640 --> 04:07:07,640
Let me just take crouch this side.

5205
04:07:10,380 --> 04:07:13,520
I think I was maybe just a little too close.

5206
04:07:20,060 --> 04:07:20,860
Recycle!

5207
04:07:21,760 --> 04:07:22,560
Recycle!

5208
04:07:23,720 --> 04:07:24,440
Recycle!

5209
04:07:28,610 --> 04:07:29,370
Okay.

5210
04:07:41,600 --> 04:07:41,980
Alright.

5211
04:07:42,520 --> 04:07:43,300
We made it.

5212
04:07:45,900 --> 04:07:46,660
Okay.

5213
04:07:48,280 --> 04:07:49,180
Press the button.

5214
04:07:51,500 --> 04:07:52,100
Oh my god.

5215
04:07:52,220 --> 04:07:52,420
Please.

5216
04:07:52,660 --> 04:07:53,100
Please.

5217
04:07:53,420 --> 04:07:54,980
Please get up faster.

5218
04:07:55,320 --> 04:07:55,840
Please!

5219
04:07:56,320 --> 04:07:57,040
Please!

5220
04:07:57,440 --> 04:08:00,220
Why is this elevator so slow?!

5221
04:08:01,220 --> 04:08:01,560
Please!

5222
04:08:02,300 --> 04:08:03,280
Oh my god!

5223
04:08:03,860 --> 04:08:05,380
Oh my god!

5224
04:08:05,560 --> 04:08:07,400
It was taking eight...

5225
04:08:07,400 --> 04:08:07,560
Oh!

5226
04:08:09,160 --> 04:08:10,160
Get up, get up.

5227
04:08:10,440 --> 04:08:10,460
Oh!

5228
04:08:10,800 --> 04:08:11,200
Here we go.

5229
04:08:11,540 --> 04:08:11,580
There we go.

5230
04:08:11,580 --> 04:08:13,380
That's fucking red, bitch!

5231
04:08:13,880 --> 04:08:15,040
Ha ha ha ha.

5232
04:08:15,540 --> 04:08:16,220
Oh!

5233
04:08:16,420 --> 04:08:19,460
When it closes, it goes so fucking fast!

5234
04:08:20,840 --> 04:08:21,840
That was the...

5235
04:08:21,840 --> 04:08:27,240
I like how it goes, like, like, 0.25 speed when it goes down.

5236
04:08:27,860 --> 04:08:30,360
And then, like, 2x if we go up.

5237
04:08:35,240 --> 04:08:35,720
Oh?

5238
04:08:39,460 --> 04:08:40,640
Oh, nice.

5239
04:08:43,900 --> 04:08:44,140
How do I do it?

5240
04:08:46,200 --> 04:08:47,400
No shaking the elevator, baby.

5241
04:08:51,840 --> 04:08:55,040
Hang on your conscience, if things take a downward turn.

5242
04:08:55,180 --> 04:08:56,100
I thank God for that.

5243
04:08:56,680 --> 04:08:58,740
We have life insurance, right?

5244
04:08:58,980 --> 04:09:01,140
Which is still good, but less good.

5245
04:09:02,100 --> 04:09:06,580
You can fix it as a team, and no one person is to blame.

5246
04:09:07,680 --> 04:09:08,680
Okay, let's just hop on one.

5247
04:09:08,680 --> 04:09:11,480
Oh my God, what the fuck?

5248
04:09:11,640 --> 04:09:12,100
Okay.

5249
04:09:12,300 --> 04:09:12,680
Ready to get the plunge?

5250
04:09:13,780 --> 04:09:14,140
Great.

5251
04:09:14,760 --> 04:09:16,060
Why is this...

5252
04:09:16,060 --> 04:09:18,600
Why is turtle rabbit...

5253
04:09:18,600 --> 04:09:20,720
What does turtle rabbit mean?

5254
04:09:20,720 --> 04:09:21,420
I need...

5255
04:09:25,240 --> 04:09:26,080
Next...

5256
04:09:26,080 --> 04:09:27,360
Rebalance the elevator.

5257
04:09:28,140 --> 04:09:28,880
That's it?

5258
04:09:29,200 --> 04:09:30,060
No details?

5259
04:09:30,820 --> 04:09:32,380
I don't trust you.

5260
04:09:35,100 --> 04:09:36,780
I don't...

5261
04:09:39,540 --> 04:09:42,720
Why couldn't they just ride slow fast?!

5262
04:09:42,720 --> 04:09:45,080
Why did they put turtle rabbit?!

5263
04:09:48,460 --> 04:09:55,000
This is, like, those, like, bomb... the, like, make sure... no, keep talking, nobody explodes.

5264
04:10:02,470 --> 04:10:03,910
Four overrides?

5265
04:10:04,690 --> 04:10:06,370
The open maintenance hatch button.

5266
04:10:08,570 --> 04:10:13,550
Okay, start the diagnostic team by inputting the following code.

5267
04:10:15,350 --> 04:10:20,050
Two... three... four... one...

5268
04:10:27,340 --> 04:10:33,020
two... three... four... one.

5269
04:10:34,080 --> 04:10:34,980
I'm alive!

5270
04:10:35,400 --> 04:10:37,080
You are now safe to close everything up.

5271
04:10:52,780 --> 04:10:53,500
What?

5272
04:10:56,880 --> 04:10:59,260
How do I... how do I close this?

5273
04:11:00,080 --> 04:11:01,300
Door override?

5274
04:11:01,840 --> 04:11:03,420
There's no closed door?

5275
04:11:04,340 --> 04:11:07,140
Turn on the elevator and disengage the emergency brake.

5276
04:11:07,320 --> 04:11:07,720
Oh, okay.

5277
04:11:08,440 --> 04:11:11,240
If all went well...

5278
04:11:12,800 --> 04:11:13,660
Alright, there we go.

5279
04:11:14,060 --> 04:11:15,940
I was gonna say, where the fuck is closed door?

5280
04:11:15,940 --> 04:11:18,180
Where... where is...

5281
04:11:18,180 --> 04:11:19,340
Where is...

5282
04:11:19,340 --> 04:11:20,340
Alright, there we go.

5283
04:11:22,540 --> 04:11:23,380
I did... oh!

5284
04:11:23,680 --> 04:11:23,820
Oh!

5285
04:11:24,360 --> 04:11:24,840
Oh!

5286
04:11:24,860 --> 04:11:25,480
Oh my god, Sali!

5287
04:11:25,720 --> 04:11:26,260
Oh my god!

5288
04:11:26,940 --> 04:11:29,020
There's too much weight in the elevator.

5289
04:11:29,420 --> 04:11:30,660
That's right, Sali!

5290
04:11:30,660 --> 04:11:32,740
She's saying you're fucking fat!

5291
04:11:33,300 --> 04:11:34,700
She's fat shaming you!

5292
04:11:34,860 --> 04:11:36,640
That makes you so mad, doesn't it?

5293
04:11:37,140 --> 04:11:37,460
Yeah?

5294
04:11:37,840 --> 04:11:40,240
Why don't you go kill Fiona instead of me?

5295
04:11:43,100 --> 04:11:44,340
Oh shit!

5296
04:11:44,620 --> 04:11:45,300
Fuck Fiona!

5297
04:11:47,420 --> 04:11:47,920
Yeah!

5298
04:11:48,200 --> 04:11:48,340
Yeah!

5299
04:11:49,020 --> 04:11:49,600
Okay!

5300
04:11:50,000 --> 04:11:53,580
As for the elevator, it's just a bunch of Ed's chicken scratches.

5301
04:11:55,240 --> 04:11:56,520
Wait, what?

5302
04:11:59,060 --> 04:12:00,260
Wait, what?

5303
04:12:00,260 --> 04:12:00,600
Wait, what?

5304
04:12:00,600 --> 04:12:00,760
Okay!

5305
04:12:01,060 --> 04:12:04,600
I remember you're supposed to use the emergency brake.

5306
04:12:06,380 --> 04:12:08,160
Then turn off the elevator.

5307
04:12:08,520 --> 04:12:08,620
Oh, right!

5308
04:12:08,820 --> 04:12:12,260
You need to realign the elevator using the realignment thingy.

5309
04:12:13,960 --> 04:12:15,300
Oh my god, please.

5310
04:12:16,720 --> 04:12:18,960
Oh my god, it's so...

5311
04:12:19,420 --> 04:12:19,740
Okay.

5312
04:12:20,420 --> 04:12:22,160
Increase the speed of the elevator.

5313
04:12:22,400 --> 04:12:24,500
Once you've figured that part out.

5314
04:12:24,940 --> 04:12:26,000
Power on the elevator.

5315
04:12:26,260 --> 04:12:27,480
Disengage the emergency.

5316
04:12:29,120 --> 04:12:29,600
Okay.

5317
04:12:29,920 --> 04:12:30,360
Okay.

5318
04:12:30,380 --> 04:12:30,660
Here we go.

5319
04:12:31,400 --> 04:12:33,340
Surely things are okay now, right?

5320
04:12:39,180 --> 04:12:39,660
Wait.

5321
04:12:40,220 --> 04:12:40,700
Oh!

5322
04:12:41,480 --> 04:12:42,640
Oh my god, he's not dead.

5323
04:12:43,560 --> 04:12:43,740
What?

5324
04:12:44,220 --> 04:12:44,820
What happened?

5325
04:12:45,620 --> 04:12:46,760
She got crushed?

5326
04:12:50,840 --> 04:12:52,520
Oh my god, did she got crushed?

5327
04:12:52,620 --> 04:12:53,320
What happened?

5328
04:12:54,540 --> 04:12:55,700
What happened to her?

5329
04:12:57,860 --> 04:12:58,920
Yeah, she died.

5330
04:12:59,200 --> 04:13:00,040
Did he get bailed?

5331
04:13:00,120 --> 04:13:01,640
Yeah, the mimic bailed on her.

5332
04:13:03,100 --> 04:13:05,500
Yeah, after Fiona fucking fat shamed her.

5333
04:13:05,960 --> 04:13:07,020
Mimic was like...

5334
04:13:07,020 --> 04:13:09,160
Oh my gosh, I gotta change to another guy.

5335
04:13:09,660 --> 04:13:09,920
I...

5336
04:13:10,480 --> 04:13:12,020
I gotta look after myself.

5337
04:13:12,240 --> 04:13:12,880
I can't be...

5338
04:13:12,880 --> 04:13:14,100
I let myself go there.

5339
04:13:14,240 --> 04:13:14,780
Holy shit.

5340
04:13:20,510 --> 04:13:21,610
Oh, I'm back here.

5341
04:13:25,600 --> 04:13:27,380
I wanna make sure I didn't miss anything.

5342
04:13:30,860 --> 04:13:31,880
How do I get up?

5343
04:13:32,100 --> 04:13:32,260
Oh.

5344
04:13:32,600 --> 04:13:33,600
Just walked up the door.

5345
04:13:33,820 --> 04:13:34,120
Oh.

5346
04:13:34,360 --> 04:13:34,680
Yeah.

5347
04:13:39,400 --> 04:13:39,940
Crank.

5348
04:13:40,660 --> 04:13:40,980
Crank.

5349
04:13:43,520 --> 04:13:44,060
Crank.

5350
04:13:44,060 --> 04:13:45,580
Oh, he made something for me.

5351
04:13:45,660 --> 04:13:46,320
What did you make?

5352
04:13:49,580 --> 04:13:50,660
I'm back here.

5353
04:13:51,140 --> 04:13:51,600
Oh!

5354
04:13:51,700 --> 04:13:52,620
I'm back in the beginning.

5355
04:13:54,600 --> 04:13:56,520
I'm missing one more...

5356
04:13:56,520 --> 04:13:57,220
thing.

5357
04:13:59,220 --> 04:14:01,560
Finally, you have access to the admin wing.

5358
04:14:01,800 --> 04:14:03,600
That's where Murray's office is located.

5359
04:14:04,040 --> 04:14:04,760
And most importantly...

5360
04:14:04,760 --> 04:14:06,040
Oh my god, that's $25.

5361
04:14:06,820 --> 04:14:09,520
The best way to the admin wing is through the warehouse.

5362
04:14:10,180 --> 04:14:11,020
That's the big room you've got...

5363
04:14:11,020 --> 04:14:12,500
Back to where it's all started.

5364
04:14:13,680 --> 04:14:15,260
You can see it through that window.

5365
04:14:16,220 --> 04:14:17,560
Guess you should've gone there first.

5366
04:14:18,580 --> 04:14:20,560
But hindsight is 20-20, right?

5367
04:14:21,420 --> 04:14:24,580
As always, try to keep quiet and don't draw attention to yourself.

5368
04:14:25,000 --> 04:14:28,300
Do that and I'm positive nothing else bad is going to happen to you.

5369
04:14:28,300 --> 04:14:30,040
Oh my god, it's two more hours and then I'll be free.

5370
04:14:30,060 --> 04:14:31,580
The next time something else bad happens to you.

5371
04:14:35,950 --> 04:14:37,990
Okay, so I need to go...

5372
04:14:40,050 --> 04:14:40,450
To...

5373
04:14:41,130 --> 04:14:42,770
Do I have any extra messages?

5374
04:14:43,430 --> 04:14:45,550
Hey, I can't get the incinerator up and running.

5375
04:14:46,030 --> 04:14:47,650
The chutes are getting clogged again.

5376
04:14:48,310 --> 04:14:51,350
Alright, so I need to go to...

5377
04:14:55,340 --> 04:14:55,860
Admin.

5378
04:14:56,220 --> 04:14:57,840
And that's through the warehouse.

5379
04:14:58,880 --> 04:15:02,680
Okay, and the warehouse is in the front.

5380
04:15:03,260 --> 04:15:03,740
Okay.

5381
04:15:04,660 --> 04:15:06,940
Alright, it's back where the elephant room is.

5382
04:15:11,000 --> 04:15:12,120
It's back here.

5383
04:15:17,760 --> 04:15:19,340
Alright, and then it should be...

5384
04:15:19,340 --> 04:15:19,800
Oh, it's here!

5385
04:15:20,620 --> 04:15:21,580
That's the warehouse.

5386
04:15:23,460 --> 04:15:25,000
Should have access to it now.

5387
04:15:26,360 --> 04:15:27,560
Wait, that's not it.

5388
04:15:27,920 --> 04:15:28,860
Oh, but I got...

5389
04:15:28,860 --> 04:15:29,160
Yay!

5390
04:15:29,780 --> 04:15:30,560
I got connectable!

5391
04:15:31,720 --> 04:15:34,140
Okay, clearly I read it wrong.

5392
04:15:40,330 --> 04:15:42,050
I'm gonna put this back first.

5393
04:15:43,750 --> 04:15:46,410
I wanna carry it all the way back there.

5394
04:15:47,090 --> 04:15:48,170
I'll put it here.

5395
04:15:48,390 --> 04:15:49,110
Just in case.

5396
04:15:52,730 --> 04:15:53,770
Happy accidents.

5397
04:15:55,370 --> 04:15:55,810
Yay!

5398
04:16:00,000 --> 04:16:00,440
Alright.

5399
04:16:00,760 --> 04:16:03,440
Now we go to the admin room.

5400
04:16:05,540 --> 04:16:07,540
I don't know, it was like a Swiss army knife.

5401
04:16:08,820 --> 04:16:10,060
Okay, it should be here.

5402
04:16:11,380 --> 04:16:12,480
There you go, the warehouse.

5403
04:16:12,880 --> 04:16:13,980
I have access to it now.

5404
04:16:14,360 --> 04:16:14,760
Look at that.

5405
04:16:15,320 --> 04:16:16,960
I'm a very important person.

5406
04:16:20,160 --> 04:16:22,120
It's really weird that this is like...

5407
04:16:22,120 --> 04:16:25,400
I guess it's a little clever that this is the loading screen.

5408
04:16:25,660 --> 04:16:26,580
By God.

5409
04:16:28,300 --> 04:16:29,780
It's a little awkward that...

5410
04:16:31,360 --> 04:16:33,980
That the loading screen takes this long to load.

5411
04:16:33,980 --> 04:16:38,760
It's weird because I'm not used to games taking that long to load these days.

5412
04:16:39,000 --> 04:16:39,980
Because it's like, you know...

5413
04:16:41,240 --> 04:16:44,220
Games nowadays usually don't have loading screens.

5414
04:16:47,300 --> 04:16:47,820
Yeah.

5415
04:16:48,760 --> 04:16:51,660
It's so weird that it actually takes a while to load.

5416
04:16:55,740 --> 04:16:56,820
There's the shortcut.

5417
04:16:58,160 --> 04:16:59,300
Oh my God, is that Chica?

5418
04:17:00,640 --> 04:17:02,520
Oh my God, she's rollerblading.

5419
04:17:03,220 --> 04:17:04,180
Look at her gold.

5420
04:17:04,920 --> 04:17:06,000
She's beautiful.

5421
04:17:09,360 --> 04:17:10,660
Oh my God.

5422
04:17:12,900 --> 04:17:14,160
Oh my God, I'm sorry.

5423
04:17:18,530 --> 04:17:19,950
She's so fabulous.

5424
04:17:21,030 --> 04:17:22,230
And so smooth.

5425
04:17:25,780 --> 04:17:27,030
I'm just trying to figure out like...

5426
04:17:27,590 --> 04:17:28,350
Oh, there it is.

5427
04:17:29,890 --> 04:17:30,350
You know what?

5428
04:17:30,890 --> 04:17:33,050
When there's a lever, there's a goal.

5429
04:17:41,640 --> 04:17:42,440
A half.

5430
04:17:43,440 --> 04:17:44,780
Watch me crack that first.

5431
04:17:45,960 --> 04:17:47,140
And then I'll go in here.

5432
04:17:48,160 --> 04:17:49,860
Crank that soldier boy.

5433
04:17:53,870 --> 04:17:54,550
That's me!

5434
04:18:00,070 --> 04:18:00,850
Wait, where did...

5435
04:18:00,850 --> 04:18:02,670
Oh my God, I was gonna say, where did it go?

5436
04:18:04,050 --> 04:18:05,130
There's another one.

5437
04:18:06,570 --> 04:18:08,170
I don't know where to put these.

5438
04:18:11,470 --> 04:18:11,930
Sofa?

5439
04:18:16,130 --> 04:18:17,610
Wait, where do we put these?

5440
04:18:19,550 --> 04:18:21,310
What do I do with this?

5441
04:18:22,870 --> 04:18:24,150
I don't fucking know.

5442
04:18:28,650 --> 04:18:29,790
Instructions aren't clear.

5443
04:18:39,000 --> 04:18:41,340
Yeah, but where is the fluid puzzle?

5444
04:18:46,450 --> 04:18:47,230
Eat it.

5445
04:18:48,050 --> 04:18:50,750
I'm like trying to figure out where the fuck the puzzle is.

5446
04:18:51,690 --> 04:18:53,370
Because I have two of the pieces here.

5447
04:19:03,420 --> 04:19:04,300
Is it here?

5448
04:19:06,300 --> 04:19:07,600
Ah, there's another crank.

5449
04:19:16,850 --> 04:19:18,690
Try and try again.

5450
04:19:23,640 --> 04:19:24,920
Where the fuck?

5451
04:19:29,660 --> 04:19:30,260
Here?

5452
04:19:31,600 --> 04:19:33,180
Oh my God, there's a line!

5453
04:19:33,460 --> 04:19:33,580
Oh!

5454
04:19:33,580 --> 04:19:33,660
No!

5455
04:19:35,180 --> 04:19:35,640
Ah!

5456
04:19:41,400 --> 04:19:41,860
No!

5457
04:19:42,540 --> 04:19:43,620
At least I know where they are.

5458
04:19:44,060 --> 04:19:45,180
I know where they are now.

5459
04:19:46,880 --> 04:19:47,340
Oh!

5460
04:19:49,640 --> 04:19:51,000
I know where they are.

5461
04:19:51,720 --> 04:19:52,180
Okay.

5462
04:19:52,980 --> 04:19:54,860
I saw like, the wires.

5463
04:19:55,300 --> 04:19:58,140
And I was like, oh my God, that's...

5464
04:19:58,140 --> 04:19:59,380
Oh my God.

5465
04:19:59,380 --> 04:19:59,740
Okay.

5466
04:20:02,060 --> 04:20:04,960
I looked at, I looked at the wires on the floor.

5467
04:20:07,240 --> 04:20:08,580
It's like, right here.

5468
04:20:13,620 --> 04:20:14,340
There it is.

5469
04:20:14,460 --> 04:20:15,640
Oh my God, there it is.

5470
04:20:16,440 --> 04:20:17,360
There it is.

5471
04:20:21,510 --> 04:20:22,790
Oh my God, there it is.

5472
04:20:22,790 --> 04:20:22,830
Oh my God, there it is.

5473
04:20:26,260 --> 04:20:26,660
Okay.

5474
04:20:27,920 --> 04:20:29,540
And then one is like, here.

5475
04:20:30,180 --> 04:20:30,680
Wait, no.

5476
04:20:31,220 --> 04:20:32,200
Wait, where's the other one?

5477
04:20:34,100 --> 04:20:36,900
Shit, wait, I actually don't remember where they all are.

5478
04:20:39,660 --> 04:20:43,140
I remember, but I also don't remember.

5479
04:20:47,850 --> 04:20:48,730
It's like, here.

5480
04:20:51,010 --> 04:20:52,330
I remember.

5481
04:20:53,210 --> 04:20:53,770
Guys.

5482
04:20:54,330 --> 04:20:55,970
I remember for real.

5483
04:20:59,630 --> 04:21:00,130
Okay.

5484
04:21:02,030 --> 04:21:03,630
Let's spin the wheel.

5485
04:21:17,550 --> 04:21:19,450
Okay, I'll do this one first.

5486
04:21:19,710 --> 04:21:21,230
I'll pull this lever first.

5487
04:21:25,310 --> 04:21:26,690
And then I'll do this.

5488
04:21:29,530 --> 04:21:32,610
Try if I want to, try if I want to.

5489
04:21:34,510 --> 04:21:36,510
That reminds me of like...

5490
04:21:36,510 --> 04:21:38,710
Oh, there was this old song that sounds like that.

5491
04:21:43,360 --> 04:21:43,960
Okay.

5492
04:21:44,660 --> 04:21:45,340
Right here.

5493
04:21:48,360 --> 04:21:48,960
Okay.

5494
04:21:49,260 --> 04:21:51,160
The last one is all the way back there.

5495
04:21:55,050 --> 04:21:56,170
Look at her phone.

5496
04:21:56,470 --> 04:21:57,510
She's so beautiful.

5497
04:21:58,030 --> 04:21:59,510
She's so fabulous.

5498
04:22:00,750 --> 04:22:03,470
It's like I'm watching Miss Universe right now.

5499
04:22:04,010 --> 04:22:05,690
There she is.

5500
04:22:06,170 --> 04:22:07,590
Miss Universe.

5501
04:22:08,190 --> 04:22:09,070
There she is.

5502
04:22:09,210 --> 04:22:10,710
I keep going to the storage room.

5503
04:22:12,690 --> 04:22:13,730
So elegant.

5504
04:22:14,110 --> 04:22:14,710
So pretty.

5505
04:22:19,620 --> 04:22:21,560
Why did it have to start now?

5506
04:22:22,140 --> 04:22:23,380
I was not ready.

5507
04:22:32,100 --> 04:22:33,180
Okay, I was ready.

5508
04:22:36,200 --> 04:22:36,720
Jacob.

5509
04:22:46,240 --> 04:22:48,780
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

5510
04:22:49,040 --> 04:22:49,560
That was close.

5511
04:22:49,860 --> 04:22:50,200
That was close.

5512
04:22:50,640 --> 04:22:51,780
That was close.

5513
04:22:54,360 --> 04:22:54,880
Okay.

5514
04:22:57,440 --> 04:22:58,100
There you go.

5515
04:22:59,400 --> 04:23:00,940
Just rolling away.

5516
04:23:08,880 --> 04:23:10,980
She has no thumbs, thank god.

5517
04:23:11,720 --> 04:23:12,580
Not like Dolly.

5518
04:23:13,960 --> 04:23:15,720
This one doesn't have thumbs.

5519
04:23:16,440 --> 04:23:17,120
We did it.

5520
04:23:19,140 --> 04:23:20,600
Oh my god, please open faster.

5521
04:23:21,000 --> 04:23:21,720
Please open faster.

5522
04:23:23,260 --> 04:23:24,180
Here we go.

5523
04:23:24,480 --> 04:23:25,320
We did it!

5524
04:23:25,780 --> 04:23:26,760
We win!

5525
04:23:27,480 --> 04:23:31,820
Look, I get your concerns, I do, but they're all just groundless.

5526
04:23:32,180 --> 04:23:34,380
This is the perfect spot for David's flavor.

5527
04:23:34,680 --> 04:23:39,800
I can watch him play while I'm loading and unloading freight, and he'll be under watch at all time zone.

5528
04:23:40,340 --> 04:23:43,980
The loading dock is like 200 feet away, and there's a fence and everything.

5529
04:23:44,460 --> 04:23:46,000
Oh, we took a child here.

5530
04:23:46,220 --> 04:23:47,060
Holy shit.

5531
04:23:48,280 --> 04:23:49,340
Oh, it's the lawyer.

5532
04:23:49,700 --> 04:23:51,160
Just get off my back.

5533
04:23:51,640 --> 04:23:54,380
Besides, David loves the new slide.

5534
04:23:55,520 --> 04:23:56,360
It'll be fine.

5535
04:23:59,000 --> 04:23:59,520
Wait.

5536
04:24:01,340 --> 04:24:03,760
I don't think this is a good place for kids.

5537
04:24:04,180 --> 04:24:06,380
But I don't know, I don't have kids, so...

5538
04:24:06,380 --> 04:24:08,200
What do I know, am I right?

5539
04:24:11,240 --> 04:24:13,420
My opinion is clearly irrelevant.

5540
04:24:15,600 --> 04:24:16,480
David died.

5541
04:24:16,620 --> 04:24:18,920
No, no, he's totally fine, guys.

5542
04:24:19,580 --> 04:24:21,920
The mimic definitely protected him.

5543
04:24:23,740 --> 04:24:25,220
Can I die from that?

5544
04:24:29,880 --> 04:24:31,440
Oh, it's parkour!

5545
04:24:34,260 --> 04:24:34,960
Wait, no.

5546
04:24:35,220 --> 04:24:35,840
I can just crouch.

5547
04:24:40,800 --> 04:24:42,060
Can I do anything here?

5548
04:24:44,160 --> 04:24:45,300
Like, stuff here.

5549
04:24:47,820 --> 04:24:49,160
No, I think...

5550
04:24:49,160 --> 04:24:51,000
Hmm, it might be a little dangerous.

5551
04:24:51,140 --> 04:24:51,920
I can't...

5552
04:24:51,920 --> 04:24:56,320
I'm not like fully sure yet, but it seems a little dangerous.

5553
04:24:56,640 --> 04:24:57,760
I'm not that sure yet.

5554
04:25:02,260 --> 04:25:03,760
Oh, it is like parkour.

5555
04:25:03,920 --> 04:25:04,520
Like, I can...

5556
04:25:04,520 --> 04:25:05,520
Can I fall down here?

5557
04:25:05,700 --> 04:25:06,060
I have to...

5558
04:25:07,800 --> 04:25:09,100
I have to... I have to walk...

5559
04:25:09,880 --> 04:25:10,660
Oh my god.

5560
04:25:10,760 --> 04:25:12,960
If I fall, I should have to walk back all the way here.

5561
04:25:16,120 --> 04:25:17,920
It's okay, we have insurance.

5562
04:25:23,910 --> 04:25:25,510
Okay, now I'm a little worried.

5563
04:25:35,720 --> 04:25:36,900
Okay, yeah.

5564
04:25:37,500 --> 04:25:39,380
Don't worry, I have really good...

5565
04:25:40,780 --> 04:25:41,640
It's okay.

5566
04:25:41,920 --> 04:25:44,800
I have really good insurance, guys.

5567
04:25:46,300 --> 04:25:47,900
I got a little...

5568
04:25:47,900 --> 04:25:50,120
Oh, am I supposed to like push these?

5569
04:25:51,300 --> 04:25:52,840
Wait, can I push them?

5570
04:25:57,890 --> 04:25:58,710
I don't understand.

5571
04:25:59,070 --> 04:26:00,570
Cause like, when I walk to the...

5572
04:26:00,570 --> 04:26:02,390
Wait, is there a computer that can...

5573
04:26:02,390 --> 04:26:03,490
Oh, this computer.

5574
04:26:03,690 --> 04:26:04,250
I'm so dumb.

5575
04:26:05,850 --> 04:26:07,230
Does computer have like...

5576
04:26:07,230 --> 04:26:07,610
Okay, no.

5577
04:26:07,750 --> 04:26:08,110
Nevermind.

5578
04:26:09,910 --> 04:26:10,350
Nevermind.

5579
04:26:10,490 --> 04:26:11,150
This computer doesn't...

5580
04:26:12,030 --> 04:26:12,450
Okay.

5581
04:26:13,350 --> 04:26:14,870
But it's like, where do I go after...

5582
04:26:14,870 --> 04:26:15,590
Oh, wait.

5583
04:26:15,830 --> 04:26:17,130
No, where do I go after that?

5584
04:26:23,910 --> 04:26:25,230
Yeah, like, right here.

5585
04:26:26,510 --> 04:26:27,910
There's nowhere to go after.

5586
04:26:35,140 --> 04:26:36,460
I figured it out.

5587
04:26:39,140 --> 04:26:39,580
Behind?

5588
04:26:43,080 --> 04:26:44,000
What do you mean?

5589
04:26:44,820 --> 04:26:45,160
Here?

5590
04:26:49,460 --> 04:26:49,900
What?

5591
04:26:50,940 --> 04:26:52,020
Oh, the crane!

5592
04:26:52,160 --> 04:26:53,260
There's a crane controller!

5593
04:26:53,560 --> 04:26:55,200
Oh my god, I didn't even see the crane!

5594
04:26:56,580 --> 04:26:57,840
Oh, I see it now.

5595
04:26:58,020 --> 04:26:58,720
I see the crane.

5596
04:26:58,840 --> 04:26:59,480
I was so confused.

5597
04:26:59,600 --> 04:27:00,440
I was like, what the fuck?

5598
04:27:02,020 --> 04:27:02,660
What?

5599
04:27:02,660 --> 04:27:03,360
I see it.

5600
04:27:06,200 --> 04:27:06,840
Alright.

5601
04:27:07,640 --> 04:27:09,160
Let me head over to the crane.

5602
04:27:12,180 --> 04:27:13,340
There it is.

5603
04:27:13,640 --> 04:27:14,180
I got mail!

5604
04:27:15,480 --> 04:27:16,360
Oh, whoops.

5605
04:27:18,200 --> 04:27:18,840
Yay!

5606
04:27:19,280 --> 04:27:19,780
Mail time!

5607
04:27:21,540 --> 04:27:22,860
What's on the at side?

5608
04:27:23,920 --> 04:27:24,300
What's on the at side?

5609
04:27:24,980 --> 04:27:26,660
Oh my god, it's Tetris time.

5610
04:27:27,140 --> 04:27:28,400
But where am I supposed to go?

5611
04:27:29,860 --> 04:27:30,860
Is the exit...

5612
04:27:30,860 --> 04:27:31,960
Where is the exit?

5613
04:27:32,500 --> 04:27:32,620
What?

5614
04:27:34,280 --> 04:27:35,920
Try to figure out where the exit is.

5615
04:27:37,980 --> 04:27:39,620
Oh my god, I grabbed it the wrong way.

5616
04:27:45,390 --> 04:27:46,050
Okay.

5617
04:27:47,250 --> 04:27:48,230
Number one.

5618
04:27:48,790 --> 04:27:49,890
Can I rotate this?

5619
04:27:54,480 --> 04:27:56,400
Okay, and then I grab that here.

5620
04:27:57,560 --> 04:27:58,660
Oh, cool!

5621
04:27:58,960 --> 04:28:00,240
American Ninja time!

5622
04:28:02,740 --> 04:28:03,400
That's...

5623
04:28:03,400 --> 04:28:04,200
Cool.

5624
04:28:04,540 --> 04:28:05,320
That's pretty cool.

5625
04:28:05,500 --> 04:28:07,280
I can't wait for American Ninja.

5626
04:28:09,700 --> 04:28:10,360
Um...

5627
04:28:10,360 --> 04:28:12,480
Okay, I'm trying to think how to...

5628
04:28:13,180 --> 04:28:15,280
What to do here?

5629
04:28:15,700 --> 04:28:16,380
I'm...

5630
04:28:16,380 --> 04:28:18,140
I'm thinking right now.

5631
04:28:18,620 --> 04:28:21,300
Whatever the fuck I'm looking at.

5632
04:28:31,390 --> 04:28:32,770
Okay, and then...

5633
04:28:37,640 --> 04:28:39,280
Oh, I forgot.

5634
04:28:40,260 --> 04:28:40,900
Fuck.

5635
04:28:41,240 --> 04:28:41,440
Okay.

5636
04:28:41,760 --> 04:28:43,900
I forgot that like, I can't pull this over.

5637
04:28:44,160 --> 04:28:45,500
So I have to...

5638
04:28:45,500 --> 04:28:46,800
I have to put this here.

5639
04:28:51,980 --> 04:28:53,300
Putting that here.

5640
04:28:54,260 --> 04:28:54,960
Excuse me.

5641
04:28:56,240 --> 04:28:57,860
Someone do this for me.

5642
04:29:03,440 --> 04:29:03,940
Okay.

5643
04:29:07,900 --> 04:29:08,400
Now...

5644
04:29:08,400 --> 04:29:09,320
Wait, what the fuck?

5645
04:29:09,460 --> 04:29:10,200
Oh, I didn't pull that.

5646
04:29:14,740 --> 04:29:16,720
Alright, and then we do it here.

5647
04:29:20,550 --> 04:29:21,310
And then...

5648
04:29:21,310 --> 04:29:21,930
Oh, I already...

5649
04:29:21,930 --> 04:29:22,630
I fixed that!

5650
04:29:23,950 --> 04:29:24,450
Nice.

5651
04:29:25,770 --> 04:29:28,110
Okay, we'll see what the right side has.

5652
04:29:31,610 --> 04:29:32,950
Wait, what's over here?

5653
04:29:34,030 --> 04:29:36,310
Okay, there's a collectible right here.

5654
04:29:37,150 --> 04:29:37,750
So...

5655
04:29:37,750 --> 04:29:38,830
Oh my god.

5656
04:29:39,870 --> 04:29:40,750
My depth perce...

5657
04:29:40,750 --> 04:29:42,590
This is testing my depth perception right now.

5658
04:29:45,510 --> 04:29:46,730
It's right here.

5659
04:29:48,310 --> 04:29:49,590
Okay, how do I get there?

5660
04:29:54,500 --> 04:29:56,280
Wait, I wanna grab this.

5661
04:30:03,420 --> 04:30:04,480
Okay, there you go.

5662
04:30:07,080 --> 04:30:07,560
Alright.

5663
04:30:08,180 --> 04:30:09,500
We grab this first.

5664
04:30:11,840 --> 04:30:13,220
Wait, but what's up here?

5665
04:30:14,700 --> 04:30:15,840
There's something up here.

5666
04:30:19,770 --> 04:30:20,590
Anything here?

5667
04:30:20,770 --> 04:30:22,610
Oh, it just makes me look at this better.

5668
04:30:23,970 --> 04:30:26,170
Okay, but what's on that right side?

5669
04:30:26,350 --> 04:30:28,010
Cause the left side is the...

5670
04:30:28,010 --> 04:30:28,990
So I...

5671
04:30:28,990 --> 04:30:30,250
I'm gonna try and go for the...

5672
04:30:30,250 --> 04:30:31,530
Right side first?

5673
04:30:32,190 --> 04:30:33,850
Is the right side dead end?

5674
04:30:34,310 --> 04:30:35,450
Or is that important?

5675
04:30:36,610 --> 04:30:39,230
Cause I can figure out the solution for the left side.

5676
04:30:40,510 --> 04:30:41,590
Oh, it's a dead end.

5677
04:30:41,690 --> 04:30:41,870
Okay.

5678
04:30:47,740 --> 04:30:48,700
How the...

5679
04:30:48,700 --> 04:30:50,260
Fuck do I do that?

5680
04:30:54,100 --> 04:30:55,120
Do I die?

5681
04:31:07,520 --> 04:31:08,580
Okay, I crouch.

5682
04:31:08,800 --> 04:31:09,640
Okay, I don't die.

5683
04:31:09,820 --> 04:31:10,220
Thank god.

5684
04:31:10,220 --> 04:31:11,500
I was like...

5685
04:31:11,500 --> 04:31:12,600
I'm like thinking.

5686
04:31:12,940 --> 04:31:15,520
And I'm like, What the fuck am I looking at?

5687
04:31:20,360 --> 04:31:22,340
I guess I'll just die.

5688
04:31:25,730 --> 04:31:27,750
Okay, I got junior nurse kit.

5689
04:31:28,510 --> 04:31:30,470
Oh, it does get to the other crane.

5690
04:31:30,950 --> 04:31:31,050
Huh.

5691
04:31:33,070 --> 04:31:34,350
Oh, so that's useless.

5692
04:31:35,470 --> 04:31:36,490
Yeah, I'll just drop down.

5693
04:31:37,370 --> 04:31:38,410
And then do this again.

5694
04:31:42,190 --> 04:31:42,950
Alright.

5695
04:31:43,150 --> 04:31:45,010
Like why did he add fireworks?

5696
04:31:45,730 --> 04:31:46,230
Wha...

5697
04:31:46,230 --> 04:31:48,070
Why did he...

5698
04:31:48,670 --> 04:31:49,370
Is that...

5699
04:31:49,610 --> 04:31:51,470
Is that what makes it more fun?

5700
04:31:52,370 --> 04:31:53,130
Fireworks?

5701
04:31:53,690 --> 04:31:55,230
Why did he add fireworks?

5702
04:31:58,790 --> 04:31:59,170
Okay.

5703
04:32:00,310 --> 04:32:02,130
Alright, so the solution is...

5704
04:32:02,730 --> 04:32:03,390
We put here...

5705
04:32:03,390 --> 04:32:04,150
This thing here.

5706
04:32:06,310 --> 04:32:08,190
Kids love to lose fingers.

5707
04:32:10,910 --> 04:32:13,090
Like he didn't have to put fireworks.

5708
04:32:19,490 --> 04:32:22,030
Like he could have the same results...

5709
04:32:22,030 --> 04:32:22,990
Without fireworks.

5710
04:32:23,210 --> 04:32:24,550
That's why I'm so confused.

5711
04:32:33,780 --> 04:32:35,340
Why not little bro?

5712
04:32:35,340 --> 04:32:35,460
No.

5713
04:32:38,420 --> 04:32:38,960
Okay.

5714
04:32:39,040 --> 04:32:40,340
And then...

5715
04:32:41,500 --> 04:32:42,240
Okay, wait.

5716
04:32:42,300 --> 04:32:43,500
This is definitely not the solution.

5717
04:32:47,420 --> 04:32:48,420
Oh, no.

5718
04:32:48,800 --> 04:32:49,160
Okay.

5719
04:32:52,160 --> 04:32:52,700
Uh...

5720
04:32:52,700 --> 04:32:53,680
Oh...

5721
04:32:53,680 --> 04:32:54,940
How the fuck do I do this?

5722
04:32:59,230 --> 04:33:01,130
I could do it like...

5723
04:33:08,420 --> 04:33:09,500
Let's see...

5724
04:33:17,760 --> 04:33:18,300
Wait.

5725
04:33:18,800 --> 04:33:19,140
Okay.

5726
04:33:19,220 --> 04:33:20,740
I'm trying to think about this.

5727
04:33:23,940 --> 04:33:25,140
I don't think so.

5728
04:33:25,520 --> 04:33:27,680
I don't think you can get there through here.

5729
04:33:29,080 --> 04:33:30,460
Or like through here.

5730
04:33:33,580 --> 04:33:34,300
Can I?

5731
04:33:39,150 --> 04:33:40,150
You think I can?

5732
04:33:48,470 --> 04:33:49,690
Yeah, I think...

5733
04:33:49,690 --> 04:33:50,010
Uh...

5734
04:33:50,010 --> 04:33:51,330
I'll go to the right side.

5735
04:33:51,770 --> 04:33:51,870
Okay.

5736
04:33:51,970 --> 04:33:53,730
If I go to the right side...

5737
04:33:55,990 --> 04:33:56,470
Uh...

5738
04:34:00,580 --> 04:34:02,180
How do I get to the right side?

5739
04:34:03,200 --> 04:34:04,280
What the fuck?

5740
04:34:13,380 --> 04:34:14,440
Soon it's like...

5741
04:34:15,040 --> 04:34:15,880
The same.

5742
04:34:16,100 --> 04:34:17,220
Where I put this here...

5743
04:34:20,140 --> 04:34:21,620
Then how do I...

5744
04:34:22,540 --> 04:34:23,020
Wait...

5745
04:34:23,020 --> 04:34:24,920
Do I put that here?

5746
04:34:26,300 --> 04:34:30,360
Wait, can I move the ha- No, but I need to go there to move the hammers.

5747
04:34:31,020 --> 04:34:31,500
Right?

5748
04:34:33,600 --> 04:34:34,280
Wait...

5749
04:34:34,280 --> 04:34:35,020
Double check.

5750
04:34:35,400 --> 04:34:35,540
Yeah.

5751
04:34:35,880 --> 04:34:37,720
I need the hammers to be there.

5752
04:34:40,220 --> 04:34:42,180
Can I move the hammers?

5753
04:34:52,500 --> 04:34:54,380
Yeah, but how do I cross that?

5754
04:34:57,960 --> 04:34:59,020
Oh my god.

5755
04:34:59,280 --> 04:35:00,420
It's tetris time.

5756
04:35:04,300 --> 04:35:04,400
Okay.

5757
04:35:04,420 --> 04:35:05,380
We put that...

5758
04:35:05,380 --> 04:35:06,580
I'll put this down here.

5759
04:35:11,590 --> 04:35:12,790
And then...

5760
04:35:13,650 --> 04:35:15,490
I hate these hammers so much.

5761
04:35:15,930 --> 04:35:16,750
I was like...

5762
04:35:16,750 --> 04:35:17,270
Boom, boom.

5763
04:35:21,760 --> 04:35:22,640
There you go.

5764
04:35:22,800 --> 04:35:23,340
I'm free.

5765
04:35:26,600 --> 04:35:27,200
Okay.

5766
04:35:27,200 --> 04:35:28,400
Never mind.

5767
04:35:30,500 --> 04:35:31,700
I'm trying...

5768
04:35:31,700 --> 04:35:31,940
Okay.

5769
04:35:32,480 --> 04:35:33,060
Give me a sec.

5770
04:35:33,140 --> 04:35:33,380
Let me...

5771
04:35:33,380 --> 04:35:34,680
I fucked it up already.

5772
04:35:35,980 --> 04:35:37,360
Okay, and then...

5773
04:35:37,360 --> 04:35:38,760
Let me pull this here.

5774
04:35:39,660 --> 04:35:41,340
Oh, but it stopped though.

5775
04:35:42,320 --> 04:35:45,820
I felt like I was free for like one second.

5776
04:35:49,620 --> 04:35:51,280
And then I'll put this here.

5777
04:35:54,880 --> 04:35:56,540
And then...

5778
04:36:06,190 --> 04:36:07,910
How did that miss?

5779
04:36:09,930 --> 04:36:11,650
Oh my god, please!

5780
04:36:12,810 --> 04:36:13,710
The control...

5781
04:36:13,710 --> 04:36:13,910
No!

5782
04:36:17,110 --> 04:36:19,690
The controls are so cheeky!

5783
04:36:23,210 --> 04:36:25,010
I don't know!

5784
04:36:27,150 --> 04:36:30,310
I don't know how I missed.

5785
04:36:30,310 --> 04:36:33,330
The controls are so cheeky!

5786
04:36:33,630 --> 04:36:34,530
Okay, I got it.

5787
04:36:36,050 --> 04:36:37,090
I got it.

5788
04:36:37,910 --> 04:36:39,690
Wait, can I lift through that?

5789
04:36:41,190 --> 04:36:43,350
Oh, I think I made this a lot harder.

5790
04:37:01,500 --> 04:37:02,760
Oh, thank god.

5791
04:37:04,740 --> 04:37:05,340
Okay.

5792
04:37:07,160 --> 04:37:09,280
The beat stop took so long!

5793
04:37:09,280 --> 04:37:12,460
Okay, that was just me timing it correctly.

5794
04:37:12,480 --> 04:37:15,820
Like, look how long it takes the softest beat!

5795
04:37:17,440 --> 04:37:18,940
Like, what the fuck!

5796
04:37:26,070 --> 04:37:26,710
Okay.

5797
04:37:29,250 --> 04:37:30,090
That's fine.

5798
04:37:31,310 --> 04:37:33,010
Oh, we made it to the side.

5799
04:37:34,230 --> 04:37:34,910
Okay.

5800
04:37:35,370 --> 04:37:35,730
Okay.

5801
04:37:35,730 --> 04:37:36,930
Now we do this one.

5802
04:37:41,620 --> 04:37:42,300
Okay.

5803
04:37:42,860 --> 04:37:44,720
Okay, it's easier because it's closer now.

5804
04:37:50,190 --> 04:37:51,550
And then...

5805
04:37:51,550 --> 04:37:52,930
Wait, how do I...

5806
04:37:53,330 --> 04:37:54,830
How do I get to the other...

5807
04:37:54,830 --> 04:37:55,510
Wait, no.

5808
04:37:56,550 --> 04:37:57,010
Wait.

5809
04:37:58,510 --> 04:37:59,390
Wait, no.

5810
04:38:04,330 --> 04:38:04,670
Okay.

5811
04:38:06,450 --> 04:38:07,170
Wait.

5812
04:38:07,210 --> 04:38:07,270
Wait.

5813
04:38:07,270 --> 04:38:08,530
Did the colourful register?

5814
04:38:08,770 --> 04:38:09,730
Oh my god!

5815
04:38:13,130 --> 04:38:14,430
Is that open?

5816
04:38:14,750 --> 04:38:15,890
I can't tell!

5817
04:38:19,610 --> 04:38:21,250
I can't tell!

5818
04:38:22,610 --> 04:38:24,370
Is that open or...

5819
04:38:27,850 --> 04:38:29,470
Guys, I can't...

5820
04:38:29,790 --> 04:38:31,210
I can't do this.

5821
04:38:31,210 --> 04:38:33,190
Oh my God!

5822
04:38:35,150 --> 04:38:37,430
NOOOO I can't.

5823
04:38:37,430 --> 04:38:38,270
I can't.

5824
04:38:38,330 --> 04:38:38,990
It's too late.

5825
04:38:40,090 --> 04:38:41,270
It's too late.

5826
04:38:41,810 --> 04:38:43,070
It's too late.

5827
04:38:43,470 --> 04:38:44,970
You can't do this to me.

5828
04:38:45,150 --> 04:38:45,750
It's too late.

5829
04:38:45,750 --> 04:38:47,390
It's too fucking late.

5830
04:38:47,550 --> 04:38:48,630
It's too late.

5831
04:38:49,970 --> 04:38:51,830
It's too late.

5832
04:38:52,630 --> 04:38:53,930
It's too late.

5833
04:38:55,630 --> 04:38:58,230
We can YouTube video it later.

5834
04:38:59,810 --> 04:39:01,770
I'm already in too deep.

5835
04:39:04,310 --> 04:39:06,710
It's never too late.

5836
04:39:08,390 --> 04:39:09,790
Guys, I can't tell.

5837
04:39:10,470 --> 04:39:11,110
It's close.

5838
04:39:12,190 --> 04:39:12,730
Please help.

5839
04:39:12,890 --> 04:39:13,850
Guys, can you lie?

5840
04:39:14,150 --> 04:39:14,690
Please.

5841
04:39:14,690 --> 04:39:14,690
Please.

5842
04:39:18,090 --> 04:39:19,750
Oh my god, there's a film.

5843
04:39:27,980 --> 04:39:29,100
Alright, here we go.

5844
04:39:29,840 --> 04:39:31,040
Alright, here we go.

5845
04:39:31,780 --> 04:39:32,940
Alright, here we go.

5846
04:39:36,500 --> 04:39:37,020
Okay.

5847
04:39:45,850 --> 04:39:47,190
I'm too slow.

5848
04:39:48,310 --> 04:39:49,650
I'm too slow.

5849
04:39:50,210 --> 04:39:51,690
Oh my god, I'm holding it.

5850
04:39:51,830 --> 04:39:53,150
I'm holding it though.

5851
04:39:53,330 --> 04:39:53,790
It's okay.

5852
04:39:54,170 --> 04:39:55,330
I'm holding it.

5853
04:39:56,450 --> 04:39:57,690
I got too greedy.

5854
04:39:58,170 --> 04:39:59,890
I got too greedy.

5855
04:40:02,070 --> 04:40:06,250
What the fuck is this timing?

5856
04:40:23,180 --> 04:40:24,680
That looks so close.

5857
04:40:25,200 --> 04:40:26,260
No, maybe it's open.

5858
04:40:26,400 --> 04:40:27,740
Maybe my eyes are wrong.

5859
04:40:31,620 --> 04:40:33,500
Guys, oh my god, it's open!

5860
04:40:33,660 --> 04:40:35,900
Oh my god, you guys almost gaslit me!

5861
04:40:36,160 --> 04:40:36,860
It's open!

5862
04:40:36,860 --> 04:40:39,340
Oh my god, OH MY GOD!

5863
04:40:39,900 --> 04:40:41,300
Oh, it's fine.

5864
04:40:42,500 --> 04:40:43,040
Oh, it's fine.

5865
04:40:43,260 --> 04:40:44,180
Oh, it's fine.

5866
04:40:45,660 --> 04:40:46,540
Oh, it's fine.

5867
04:40:46,800 --> 04:40:47,060
It's fine.

5868
04:40:47,280 --> 04:40:47,580
It's fine.

5869
04:40:47,800 --> 04:40:48,520
I almost got gaslit.

5870
04:40:49,120 --> 04:40:50,080
Oh, it's fine.

5871
04:40:50,260 --> 04:40:51,180
I have my film.

5872
04:40:54,980 --> 04:40:55,740
Thank god.

5873
04:40:56,940 --> 04:40:57,940
Oh, thank god.

5874
04:40:58,420 --> 04:41:00,360
Ed, honey, how are you holding up?

5875
04:41:00,480 --> 04:41:01,620
I just heard the news.

5876
04:41:01,840 --> 04:41:02,380
I don't know.

5877
04:41:03,180 --> 04:41:04,820
This is all so much.

5878
04:41:05,160 --> 04:41:05,980
He's gone.

5879
04:41:06,720 --> 04:41:09,120
He's gone and now everyone is asking me what to do.

5880
04:41:09,300 --> 04:41:09,740
Wait, he was gone?

5881
04:41:10,360 --> 04:41:11,680
I don't know anything.

5882
04:41:12,100 --> 04:41:13,460
I can't run a company.

5883
04:41:14,780 --> 04:41:15,560
I'm not ready.

5884
04:41:15,920 --> 04:41:16,680
Oh, he's not gone.

5885
04:41:17,720 --> 04:41:18,560
He knew it.

5886
04:41:18,980 --> 04:41:19,940
Everyone knew it.

5887
04:41:20,660 --> 04:41:23,620
The company is going to collapse and they're all going to hate me.

5888
04:41:24,040 --> 04:41:25,120
Ed, you'll figure it out.

5889
04:41:25,440 --> 04:41:27,000
Just take a deep breath.

5890
04:41:27,680 --> 04:41:28,620
It's your company now.

5891
04:41:28,920 --> 04:41:30,440
Your dad believed in you.

5892
04:41:30,580 --> 04:41:32,420
Otherwise, he wouldn't have left it to you.

5893
04:41:32,420 --> 04:41:33,860
They aren't even dead.

5894
04:41:34,180 --> 04:41:34,560
I know.

5895
04:41:34,940 --> 04:41:38,660
If you could change anything you wanted, what would it be?

5896
04:41:40,060 --> 04:41:41,260
Maybe... rebrand?

5897
04:41:41,960 --> 04:41:45,500
We could start making some of my inventions for real.

5898
04:41:48,280 --> 04:41:49,920
What other stuff would he make?

5899
04:41:52,700 --> 04:41:56,080
Oh my god, I hate it when they do the spooky child laugh.

5900
04:41:59,360 --> 04:41:59,840
Alright.

5901
04:42:02,840 --> 04:42:04,120
Hey, I can't... oh wait.

5902
04:42:04,680 --> 04:42:05,820
How are we turning down work?

5903
04:42:06,020 --> 04:42:07,820
The floats have been doing really well.

5904
04:42:08,320 --> 04:42:10,080
Its modular system is groundbreaking.

5905
04:42:10,320 --> 04:42:11,800
And now he wants to shut the whole thing down?

5906
04:42:12,000 --> 04:42:14,280
He just sits in his office talking that thing.

5907
04:42:14,500 --> 04:42:16,080
I have no clue what to do.

5908
04:42:17,320 --> 04:42:17,800
Alright.

5909
04:42:18,540 --> 04:42:19,180
Okay, look.

5910
04:42:19,280 --> 04:42:20,800
His fucking dad died.

5911
04:42:21,100 --> 04:42:21,880
Give him some slack.

5912
04:42:23,180 --> 04:42:23,660
Alright.

5913
04:42:24,620 --> 04:42:25,200
New mail.

5914
04:42:26,140 --> 04:42:27,700
We just got a letter.

5915
04:42:28,260 --> 04:42:29,500
We just got a letter.

5916
04:42:29,980 --> 04:42:31,140
Wonder who's it from.

5917
04:42:32,120 --> 04:42:32,600
Okay.

5918
04:42:33,740 --> 04:42:35,040
Oh, Chica's Party World!

5919
04:42:35,340 --> 04:42:36,280
Dear Mr. Marie.

5920
04:42:36,640 --> 04:42:37,540
Fiona is amazing.

5921
04:42:37,720 --> 04:42:39,620
The client is very happy with her chicken designs.

5922
04:42:39,980 --> 04:42:41,360
Her cells are through the roof.

5923
04:42:41,660 --> 04:42:45,140
I just wish the costume looked a little bit more like Fiona's art.

5924
04:42:45,360 --> 04:42:47,160
I'm worried about how it would work with kids.

5925
04:42:47,340 --> 04:42:48,360
It gives me nightmares.

5926
04:42:48,700 --> 04:42:49,240
Oh, from Milton.

5927
04:42:49,380 --> 04:42:50,020
I knew it.

5928
04:42:50,200 --> 04:42:51,420
I fucking knew it.

5929
04:42:51,420 --> 04:42:53,500
I was like, how would any child...

5930
04:42:53,500 --> 04:42:54,320
I was like, is it me?

5931
04:42:55,160 --> 04:42:55,940
Is it me?

5932
04:42:56,360 --> 04:42:56,520
Is it me?

5933
04:42:56,520 --> 04:42:58,680
I was like, no way a child would like that.

5934
04:43:01,300 --> 04:43:02,280
Where do I go?

5935
04:43:05,360 --> 04:43:06,560
So many doors.

5936
04:43:07,720 --> 04:43:08,580
Oh, admin went wing.

5937
04:43:10,280 --> 04:43:10,760
Okay.

5938
04:43:10,980 --> 04:43:11,720
There's the admin.

5939
04:43:13,480 --> 04:43:14,380
I'm an admin.

5940
04:43:16,320 --> 04:43:17,560
Alright, down we go.

5941
04:43:25,550 --> 04:43:26,490
I'm an admin.

5942
04:43:30,730 --> 04:43:31,330
Hello?

5943
04:43:34,250 --> 04:43:36,050
Do I check for another letter?

5944
04:43:38,050 --> 04:43:38,650
Mealtime.

5945
04:43:40,410 --> 04:43:41,010
Mealtime.

5946
04:43:45,890 --> 04:43:46,670
I'm in.

5947
04:43:53,780 --> 04:43:56,100
Yeah, cells are through the roof with the costume.

5948
04:43:56,260 --> 04:43:56,820
I guess like...

5949
04:43:56,820 --> 04:43:57,760
Oh, it's the cupcake!

5950
04:43:58,460 --> 04:44:00,600
Wait, they stole that design too?

5951
04:44:01,520 --> 04:44:02,980
What didn't they steal?

5952
04:44:02,980 --> 04:44:03,060
Yeah.

5953
04:44:03,700 --> 04:44:04,180
Oh!

5954
04:44:11,480 --> 04:44:12,960
You got me.

5955
04:44:13,400 --> 04:44:15,760
You got me.

5956
04:44:16,720 --> 04:44:19,020
He looked so friendly!

5957
04:44:19,960 --> 04:44:23,160
Yes, guys!

5958
04:44:24,520 --> 04:44:27,000
He seemed a friend shape!

5959
04:44:28,580 --> 04:44:30,460
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

5960
04:44:30,460 --> 04:44:31,560
He had rollerblades!

5961
04:44:37,830 --> 04:44:39,270
He did it!

5962
04:44:39,410 --> 04:44:39,490
He did it!

5963
04:44:39,490 --> 04:44:41,330
Yeah, I actually haven't seen the movie yet!

5964
04:44:43,950 --> 04:44:46,550
It's not stealing, it's an acquisition!

5965
04:44:49,770 --> 04:44:50,410
Alright.

5966
04:44:50,850 --> 04:44:51,330
Uh.

5967
04:44:51,790 --> 04:44:54,910
There's a lot of not friend-shaped cupcakes.

5968
04:44:58,630 --> 04:45:01,470
Now that I know they're not friend-shaped.

5969
04:45:03,010 --> 04:45:04,670
Pull me one shame.

5970
04:45:04,750 --> 04:45:05,770
Shame on me.

5971
04:45:06,870 --> 04:45:08,310
Pull me twice.

5972
04:45:08,710 --> 04:45:09,650
Shame on you!

5973
04:45:11,810 --> 04:45:13,570
When did they learn to

5974
04:45:16,760 --> 04:45:17,120
play?

5975
04:45:20,000 --> 04:45:23,880
How does he- When did he get object permanence?

5976
04:45:28,520 --> 04:45:30,720
She must have thumbs.

5977
04:45:31,460 --> 04:45:33,660
There's no way she's a bird!

5978
04:45:34,000 --> 04:45:35,720
Birds don't have thumbs!

5979
04:45:44,660 --> 04:45:45,820
That's fucked up.

5980
04:45:46,040 --> 04:45:47,440
Where the fuck do I go?

5981
04:45:52,100 --> 04:45:53,720
Yeah, cuz I'm dual kitty!

5982
04:45:54,000 --> 04:45:54,800
Cats have thumbs!

5983
04:45:55,500 --> 04:45:56,900
Wait, cats don't have thumbs.

5984
04:45:57,360 --> 04:45:57,500
Wait.

5985
04:45:59,020 --> 04:46:00,660
Wait, cats do get thumbs.

5986
04:46:00,840 --> 04:46:02,160
They're gonna take over the world.

5987
04:46:06,890 --> 04:46:09,750
Sorry, I got confused about the animal I am.

5988
04:46:16,540 --> 04:46:17,620
I swear to god.

5989
04:46:17,820 --> 04:46:19,120
Okay, now he's fucking- Okay.

5990
04:46:24,280 --> 04:46:25,040
Alright.

5991
04:46:25,480 --> 04:46:25,760
Alright.

5992
04:46:25,760 --> 04:46:26,040
That's fine.

5993
04:46:28,740 --> 04:46:30,200
Okay, to be fair.

5994
04:46:30,740 --> 04:46:33,540
Uh, Freddy Fazbear improved the design.

5995
04:46:33,920 --> 04:46:35,540
Of OG Chica.

5996
04:46:36,980 --> 04:46:41,860
Cuz that- Cuz Chica before was not as pretty.

5997
04:46:43,580 --> 04:46:44,200
Okay.

5998
04:46:45,600 --> 04:46:47,920
Okay, the cupcake was just fucking with her.

5999
04:46:49,480 --> 04:46:50,220
Okay.

6000
04:46:50,260 --> 04:46:50,320
Good.

6001
04:46:53,180 --> 04:46:54,160
Are you sure?

6002
04:46:54,280 --> 04:46:56,380
I mean, look at toy Chica!

6003
04:46:56,620 --> 04:46:58,280
I am very sure.

6004
04:47:00,120 --> 04:47:03,000
I saw what toy Chica looks like.

6005
04:47:03,800 --> 04:47:05,700
That's an improvement.

6006
04:47:06,980 --> 04:47:07,720
100%.

6007
04:47:10,020 --> 04:47:10,580
Okay.

6008
04:47:11,220 --> 04:47:12,420
Attention, traders.

6009
04:47:13,100 --> 04:47:15,700
Admin wing permissions have been revoked.

6010
04:47:15,960 --> 04:47:16,260
What?

6011
04:47:16,460 --> 04:47:18,620
You can't clear out your desks.

6012
04:47:18,780 --> 04:47:20,400
You stole my work.

6013
04:47:20,600 --> 04:47:24,720
Now your jackets, purses, and coffee mugs, and anything else belongs to me.

6014
04:47:24,940 --> 04:47:27,080
Maybe I'll go find someone to sell your stuff to.

6015
04:47:27,260 --> 04:47:28,240
How does that feel?

6016
04:47:28,480 --> 04:47:29,060
Oh no.

6017
04:47:30,000 --> 04:47:30,840
He's mad.

6018
04:47:31,100 --> 04:47:32,480
Oh no, how did he find out?

6019
04:47:33,380 --> 04:47:34,780
Is it because...

6020
04:47:35,620 --> 04:47:36,480
Is it because...

6021
04:47:38,280 --> 04:47:41,360
Of how good Freddy Fazbear pizza is?

6022
04:47:47,190 --> 04:47:47,670
What?

6023
04:47:48,310 --> 04:47:50,550
Attention, we're gonna need everyone to come in this weekend.

6024
04:47:50,710 --> 04:47:51,890
This is not optional.

6025
04:47:53,650 --> 04:47:54,130
Uh...

6026
04:47:54,130 --> 04:47:55,990
The party is on Saturday in the admin conference.

6027
04:47:56,330 --> 04:47:57,130
Don't tell David.

6028
04:47:57,130 --> 04:47:58,090
It's a surprise.

6029
04:47:58,430 --> 04:47:59,170
Okay, everyone.

6030
04:47:59,330 --> 04:48:00,130
That's quite enough.

6031
04:48:00,310 --> 04:48:02,090
No more changes to the key code, please.

6032
04:48:02,450 --> 04:48:04,370
Hey, I took Wally off of this note.

6033
04:48:04,370 --> 04:48:06,510
I changed the first two digits to 21.

6034
04:48:06,770 --> 04:48:08,250
Just because he's such a jerk.

6035
04:48:08,450 --> 04:48:10,190
I can't wait to see his head explode.

6036
04:48:10,450 --> 04:48:11,590
Okay, it's 21 something.

6037
04:48:15,050 --> 04:48:15,550
Oh?

6038
04:48:17,590 --> 04:48:19,370
Alright, it's 21 something.

6039
04:48:19,810 --> 04:48:19,970
Okay.

6040
04:48:22,030 --> 04:48:22,530
Uh...

6041
04:48:22,530 --> 04:48:23,350
Where is she?

6042
04:48:23,710 --> 04:48:24,470
Where is she?

6043
04:48:28,420 --> 04:48:28,920
Oh.

6044
04:48:29,560 --> 04:48:31,020
Oh, she's back there.

6045
04:48:31,320 --> 04:48:32,940
Wait, why the fuck is she in there?

6046
04:48:43,830 --> 04:48:44,270
Where?

6047
04:48:44,330 --> 04:48:45,610
Where is she rollerblading to?

6048
04:48:49,500 --> 04:48:50,520
Where did she go?

6049
04:48:51,720 --> 04:48:52,820
Okay, she's back there.

6050
04:48:52,980 --> 04:48:53,080
Okay.

6051
04:48:55,220 --> 04:48:56,080
No, we're fine.

6052
04:48:56,700 --> 04:48:57,580
We need to go here.

6053
04:49:01,100 --> 04:49:02,020
Alright, there we go.

6054
04:49:03,180 --> 04:49:04,800
Oh my god, that one scared me.

6055
04:49:07,600 --> 04:49:08,580
Wait, what?

6056
04:49:08,580 --> 04:49:08,680
What?

6057
04:49:09,380 --> 04:49:10,920
That just gets me more mail.

6058
04:49:12,400 --> 04:49:14,140
What am I gonna do with more mail?

6059
04:49:21,260 --> 04:49:22,480
Oh, it's like...

6060
04:49:22,480 --> 04:49:23,460
Oh my god.

6061
04:49:23,580 --> 04:49:23,840
Oh.

6062
04:49:23,980 --> 04:49:24,860
Oh my god.

6063
04:49:25,000 --> 04:49:25,640
Oh, that's bad.

6064
04:49:25,960 --> 04:49:26,940
Oh, that's bad.

6065
04:49:27,480 --> 04:49:27,740
Oh.

6066
04:49:31,780 --> 04:49:32,440
No, no.

6067
04:49:32,860 --> 04:49:33,460
Wait, where am I?

6068
04:49:33,720 --> 04:49:34,620
I don't know.

6069
04:49:38,420 --> 04:49:38,940
Oh.

6070
04:49:39,140 --> 04:49:39,240
Oh shit.

6071
04:49:39,820 --> 04:49:40,400
Oh, fuck.

6072
04:49:40,560 --> 04:49:41,500
I can't read the...

6073
04:49:41,500 --> 04:49:42,160
Oops.

6074
04:49:44,280 --> 04:49:46,240
Oh, there's the funky mushrooms.

6075
04:49:46,580 --> 04:49:47,640
Well, it's too late.

6076
04:49:47,780 --> 04:49:48,860
I can't go back now.

6077
04:49:50,540 --> 04:49:51,060
Oops.

6078
04:49:53,460 --> 04:49:55,240
Oh hey, there's the chica room.

6079
04:50:00,010 --> 04:50:02,470
Oh, I've seen these types of design.

6080
04:50:02,750 --> 04:50:05,090
Look, there's like extra ultra retro chica.

6081
04:50:06,770 --> 04:50:07,770
Okay, yeah, no.

6082
04:50:07,890 --> 04:50:09,850
Freddy Fazbear definitely improved chica.

6083
04:50:10,510 --> 04:50:11,130
I'm sorry.

6084
04:50:12,070 --> 04:50:14,090
Regular chica and uh...

6085
04:50:14,710 --> 04:50:15,970
And toy chica.

6086
04:50:19,200 --> 04:50:20,220
Okay, let's see.

6087
04:50:20,360 --> 04:50:21,800
Oh yeah, where's my projector?

6088
04:50:23,600 --> 04:50:24,160
Yeah.

6089
04:50:24,460 --> 04:50:25,600
I'm grabbing the tapes.

6090
04:50:26,340 --> 04:50:27,460
Should be in tools, right?

6091
04:50:29,420 --> 04:50:29,700
Uh...

6092
04:50:29,980 --> 04:50:31,140
Alright, just cereal.

6093
04:50:31,140 --> 04:50:34,820
Yeah, chica definitely got a glow up in Freddy Fazbear.

6094
04:50:34,980 --> 04:50:36,540
Freddy Fazbear.

6095
04:50:38,860 --> 04:50:40,300
Alright, what was this video?

6096
04:50:48,090 --> 04:50:49,990
Oh look, they got a bigger budget now.

6097
04:50:50,190 --> 04:50:52,150
Now instead of $10, it's like $50.

6098
04:50:52,150 --> 04:50:53,210
Let me try.

6099
04:50:54,790 --> 04:50:55,630
Oh!

6100
04:50:56,810 --> 04:50:57,810
Oh my god.

6101
04:50:58,750 --> 04:50:59,950
This fucking brat.

6102
04:51:09,840 --> 04:51:10,680
Silly...

6103
04:51:11,340 --> 04:51:12,320
Silly rabbit.

6104
04:51:12,660 --> 04:51:13,820
Justice for kids.

6105
04:51:14,240 --> 04:51:15,040
Oh god.

6106
04:51:15,740 --> 04:51:17,700
Why is his teeth like that?

6107
04:51:18,260 --> 04:51:19,580
Oh my god.

6108
04:51:20,460 --> 04:51:21,000
No.

6109
04:51:22,400 --> 04:51:23,220
No.

6110
04:51:23,220 --> 04:51:23,320
No.

6111
04:51:24,900 --> 04:51:25,540
Okay.

6112
04:51:25,780 --> 04:51:27,600
Let's grab...

6113
04:51:30,710 --> 04:51:32,490
We got a clean-o-vac already?

6114
04:51:32,970 --> 04:51:34,170
Okay, let's get the...

6115
04:51:36,510 --> 04:51:38,630
It's our mom single.

6116
04:51:39,390 --> 04:51:39,690
Alright.

6117
04:51:39,970 --> 04:51:40,110
Oops.

6118
04:51:41,010 --> 04:51:41,490
That in.

6119
04:51:43,350 --> 04:51:45,810
Yeah, that's not the very best idea.

6120
04:51:47,790 --> 04:51:48,430
Whoever...

6121
04:51:48,430 --> 04:51:50,450
They invent like incredibly...

6122
04:51:50,450 --> 04:51:50,770
Wait.

6123
04:51:51,950 --> 04:51:53,150
Is that...

6124
04:51:55,070 --> 04:51:55,610
Just kidding?

6125
04:51:55,770 --> 04:51:56,490
Is that just kidding?

6126
04:51:58,810 --> 04:52:00,770
Did I just put the same tape in?

6127
04:52:02,750 --> 04:52:03,290
Okay.

6128
04:52:03,410 --> 04:52:03,870
Where is he?

6129
04:52:04,210 --> 04:52:04,870
There we go.

6130
04:52:09,040 --> 04:52:09,940
I needed this.

6131
04:52:20,620 --> 04:52:21,160
Oh!

6132
04:52:21,460 --> 04:52:22,620
They're the mushroom guys!

6133
04:52:28,080 --> 04:52:28,880
Mycelium men?

6134
04:52:30,080 --> 04:52:32,380
Oh, it is like Poppy's Playtime!

6135
04:52:33,040 --> 04:52:35,260
They're like their own little toy factory.

6136
04:52:37,580 --> 04:52:38,600
But like...

6137
04:52:38,600 --> 04:52:39,560
A lot worse.

6138
04:52:40,180 --> 04:52:42,020
It's like having your very own band.

6139
04:52:42,220 --> 04:52:43,000
Or a friend.

6140
04:52:43,480 --> 04:52:44,080
Wow!

6141
04:52:47,640 --> 04:52:47,940
Wow!

6142
04:52:48,740 --> 04:52:50,060
It's like talking...

6143
04:52:50,060 --> 04:52:51,200
Like a talking dog game.

6144
04:52:51,200 --> 04:52:52,220
And let them jam.

6145
04:52:55,520 --> 04:52:56,540
Pretty groovy.

6146
04:52:57,720 --> 04:52:58,840
Musical mycelium men.

6147
04:52:59,120 --> 04:53:00,140
That is not included.

6148
04:53:00,700 --> 04:53:02,560
Another smart toy from Murray.

6149
04:53:02,860 --> 04:53:03,180
Wow!

6150
04:53:09,110 --> 04:53:09,790
Alright.

6151
04:53:10,130 --> 04:53:11,130
I'm sorry, but...

6152
04:53:11,130 --> 04:53:13,030
I'm not surprised that this toy company failed.

6153
04:53:14,610 --> 04:53:15,890
Let's do some...

6154
04:53:15,890 --> 04:53:17,370
Pretty bad ideas.

6155
04:53:19,290 --> 04:53:20,330
Yeah, I was gonna say...

6156
04:53:20,330 --> 04:53:21,990
It's definitely gonna create a feedback loop.

6157
04:53:25,130 --> 04:53:25,570
Alright.

6158
04:53:25,930 --> 04:53:26,330
What's...

6159
04:53:26,330 --> 04:53:27,090
Oh, that's the...

6160
04:53:27,090 --> 04:53:27,810
The robot!

6161
04:53:28,050 --> 04:53:28,470
That pet!

6162
04:53:32,390 --> 04:53:34,650
Are you looking for the perfect vacuum cleaner?

6163
04:53:34,790 --> 04:53:36,390
There are so many to choose from.

6164
04:53:36,530 --> 04:53:38,550
But none of them fit every corner of your home.

6165
04:53:39,430 --> 04:53:43,270
Introducing the brand new revolutionary advancement in vacuum technology.

6166
04:53:43,590 --> 04:53:44,130
Yeah, I know.

6167
04:53:44,250 --> 04:53:45,630
There was like a seeing cactus.

6168
04:53:45,870 --> 04:53:46,910
And then you put them next to each other.

6169
04:53:46,990 --> 04:53:48,190
And they just scream at each other.

6170
04:53:48,190 --> 04:53:50,130
To fit into hard to reach places.

6171
04:53:50,510 --> 04:53:54,410
Patented Murray Tech allows you to clean everything from the biggest messes.

6172
04:53:54,830 --> 04:53:55,370
Wow!

6173
04:53:56,750 --> 04:53:57,910
Back in the child.

6174
04:53:59,470 --> 04:54:00,750
To the smallest crop.

6175
04:54:00,770 --> 04:54:01,690
It's like a tech comp...

6176
04:54:01,690 --> 04:54:03,410
Oh, it's like just a general tech company.

6177
04:54:04,530 --> 04:54:06,370
One size fits all.

6178
04:54:06,610 --> 04:54:10,170
And what you really need most in a vacuum cleaner is friendship.

6179
04:54:10,170 --> 04:54:12,170
It's like that company that makes...

6180
04:54:12,830 --> 04:54:13,370
Cap...

6181
04:54:13,370 --> 04:54:13,830
What is it?

6182
04:54:13,850 --> 04:54:16,290
They used to make cameras and now they make spider jets.

6183
04:54:16,290 --> 04:54:17,010
They're spotless.

6184
04:54:17,210 --> 04:54:19,390
And your kids will have a friend for life.

6185
04:54:19,950 --> 04:54:21,570
Marie's marvelous clean-o-back.

6186
04:54:21,750 --> 04:54:24,050
Order one today and make your family a happy one.

6187
04:54:24,050 --> 04:54:24,610
Oh, it's a cute room...

6188
04:54:24,610 --> 04:54:26,190
It's a fancy Roomba!

6189
04:54:26,490 --> 04:54:27,850
He's dressed like a butler!

6190
04:54:28,170 --> 04:54:28,890
Oh, that's cute.

6191
04:54:29,430 --> 04:54:29,710
Yeah.

6192
04:54:30,190 --> 04:54:30,550
Isn't that...

6193
04:54:30,550 --> 04:54:31,170
Isn't that...

6194
04:54:31,170 --> 04:54:31,410
Canon?

6195
04:54:31,990 --> 04:54:34,430
I know there's like a Japanese...

6196
04:54:35,350 --> 04:54:35,870
Um...

6197
04:54:35,870 --> 04:54:39,150
Company that used to make cameras and now they make planes.

6198
04:54:40,010 --> 04:54:40,890
But like...

6199
04:54:42,050 --> 04:54:42,570
Like...

6200
04:54:42,570 --> 04:54:43,690
Like fighter jets.

6201
04:54:50,200 --> 04:54:50,600
What?

6202
04:54:50,660 --> 04:54:51,040
What am I thinking?

6203
04:54:51,200 --> 04:54:52,480
I know it was a Japanese company.

6204
04:54:52,620 --> 04:54:54,000
Maybe I'm thinking about the wrong technology.

6205
04:54:54,160 --> 04:54:56,620
I know they just segway into fucking planes though.

6206
04:54:57,120 --> 04:54:57,700
It's crazy.

6207
04:54:57,920 --> 04:54:59,660
I was like, that's a wild segway.

6208
04:55:00,700 --> 04:55:01,740
Chica's party world.

6209
04:55:02,200 --> 04:55:03,360
Oh, there were like other...

6210
04:55:03,360 --> 04:55:04,100
Other treats.

6211
04:55:10,400 --> 04:55:11,880
Or is it washing machines?

6212
04:55:12,800 --> 04:55:13,200
Hello!

6213
04:55:18,670 --> 04:55:19,350
Wait.

6214
04:55:19,470 --> 04:55:20,090
Wait.

6215
04:55:20,290 --> 04:55:20,610
Wait.

6216
04:55:20,750 --> 04:55:21,190
I'm stuck.

6217
04:55:21,630 --> 04:55:21,810
Wait.

6218
04:55:22,190 --> 04:55:22,330
Wait.

6219
04:55:22,630 --> 04:55:22,990
No!

6220
04:55:23,250 --> 04:55:23,710
I'm stuck!

6221
04:55:24,970 --> 04:55:25,650
No!

6222
04:55:26,890 --> 04:55:27,570
No!

6223
04:55:28,150 --> 04:55:30,910
I pet him and he pushed me into the corner!

6224
04:55:31,470 --> 04:55:33,050
Get me out of here!

6225
04:55:33,510 --> 04:55:35,890
He pushed me into the corner!

6226
04:55:39,010 --> 04:55:40,590
He tricked me!

6227
04:55:40,590 --> 04:55:42,770
I knew they were evil!

6228
04:55:43,210 --> 04:55:44,750
He put me in a...

6229
04:55:44,750 --> 04:55:45,870
He put me in a...

6230
04:55:45,870 --> 04:55:47,070
He put me in full sense of security!

6231
04:55:47,390 --> 04:55:50,330
And then he stopped locked me into the corner!

6232
04:55:50,750 --> 04:55:52,090
You fucker!

6233
04:55:55,890 --> 04:55:58,530
Get walled by walled.

6234
04:55:58,730 --> 04:56:01,290
I have to restart my game!

6235
04:56:01,830 --> 04:56:02,550
No!

6236
04:56:02,550 --> 04:56:02,590
No!

6237
04:56:08,790 --> 04:56:11,610
I can't believe it!

6238
04:56:11,990 --> 04:56:12,930
He had...

6239
04:56:12,930 --> 04:56:14,290
I don't know where...

6240
04:56:20,620 --> 04:56:23,040
I let my car down!

6241
04:56:23,600 --> 04:56:24,980
This fucker actually...

6242
04:56:29,920 --> 04:56:30,680
Holy...

6243
04:56:32,040 --> 04:56:33,120
Oh my god.

6244
04:56:33,300 --> 04:56:34,480
Do I have to...

6245
04:56:35,380 --> 04:56:37,260
Do I have to watch the clips again?

6246
04:56:38,380 --> 04:56:39,520
No, right?

6247
04:56:39,520 --> 04:56:42,700
Please tell me I don't have to watch it again, guys!

6248
04:56:46,440 --> 04:56:47,340
Fuck it.

6249
04:56:47,420 --> 04:56:48,060
Fuck you!

6250
04:56:48,280 --> 04:56:49,820
I know what you are!

6251
04:56:50,600 --> 04:56:51,940
I know...

6252
04:56:54,140 --> 04:56:56,380
I know what you are!

6253
04:57:00,240 --> 04:57:02,780
You can't get me this time!

6254
04:57:08,940 --> 04:57:11,460
I wanna make sure I grab everything.

6255
04:57:15,420 --> 04:57:17,560
You can't fool me this time.

6256
04:57:18,080 --> 04:57:20,500
Do I have and I don't.

6257
04:57:21,340 --> 04:57:22,600
I wanna grab all the mail.

6258
04:57:33,220 --> 04:57:34,340
Hello, admins!

6259
04:57:34,440 --> 04:57:34,980
Hello!

6260
04:57:35,280 --> 04:57:38,800
Let us know if there's anything we can do to make your workday more pleasant.

6261
04:57:39,180 --> 04:57:40,600
Aside from windows.

6262
04:57:41,220 --> 04:57:41,740
Windows.

6263
04:57:41,740 --> 04:57:43,860
We've heard your numerous requests and...

6264
04:57:43,860 --> 04:57:46,520
Ed promises to add windows very soon.

6265
04:57:47,180 --> 04:57:52,120
He'll have time as soon as the contract for the new Fazbear project is locked down.

6266
04:57:52,760 --> 04:57:55,300
He's been up in his office working on it all week.

6267
04:57:56,040 --> 04:57:58,840
So, anything other than windows, let us know.

6268
04:57:59,540 --> 04:58:00,640
Who needs windows?

6269
04:58:00,800 --> 04:58:02,140
I don't have windows in my office.

6270
04:58:02,140 --> 04:58:02,760
What's not doing?

6271
04:58:03,000 --> 04:58:03,280
Okay.

6272
04:58:05,900 --> 04:58:06,800
Alright, guys.

6273
04:58:07,080 --> 04:58:08,620
That robot made me so angry.

6274
04:58:08,620 --> 04:58:09,620
I need to pee.

6275
04:58:11,180 --> 04:58:13,460
We don't need to see the outside world!

6276
04:58:15,060 --> 04:58:16,080
I'll be right back.

6277
04:59:19,460 --> 04:59:20,280
Look, guys.

6278
04:59:20,560 --> 04:59:23,760
If you wanna see what grass looks like, just Google it.

6279
04:59:24,060 --> 04:59:24,760
It's fine.

6280
04:59:25,360 --> 04:59:26,620
See, I'm...

6281
04:59:26,620 --> 04:59:28,180
I don't have windows and I turn out.

6282
04:59:28,320 --> 04:59:28,620
Okay.

6283
04:59:32,620 --> 04:59:34,160
Alright, down we go.

6284
04:59:36,220 --> 04:59:36,780
True.

6285
04:59:37,720 --> 04:59:38,940
You need sunlight?

6286
04:59:39,180 --> 04:59:39,580
Just...

6287
04:59:39,580 --> 04:59:40,900
Just turn on the light.

6288
04:59:41,200 --> 04:59:42,740
It's just like the sun.

6289
04:59:47,040 --> 04:59:47,600
Fucking...

6290
04:59:55,200 --> 04:59:57,280
See, this is what happens when you go outside.

6291
04:59:57,760 --> 04:59:58,560
This is...

6292
04:59:58,560 --> 05:00:00,060
This is what happens.

6293
05:00:03,840 --> 05:00:05,240
I didn't either one.

6294
05:00:05,440 --> 05:00:08,660
I accidentally clicked on that locker, too.

6295
05:00:09,360 --> 05:00:09,720
I...

6296
05:00:09,720 --> 05:00:10,840
I didn't...

6297
05:00:11,840 --> 05:00:12,540
Okay.

6298
05:00:13,080 --> 05:00:14,800
I didn't mean to click on it.

6299
05:00:14,800 --> 05:00:16,000
I was trying to click on this.

6300
05:00:19,710 --> 05:00:20,410
Okay.

6301
05:00:22,490 --> 05:00:23,890
Guys, see, look, I learned.

6302
05:00:24,290 --> 05:00:25,770
I learned, guys.

6303
05:00:26,370 --> 05:00:26,830
I...

6304
05:00:27,300 --> 05:00:28,790
I remember it's...

6305
05:00:29,490 --> 05:00:31,410
It's one now, not zero.

6306
05:00:32,050 --> 05:00:32,410
No!

6307
05:00:37,830 --> 05:00:38,350
Not zero.

6308
05:00:39,030 --> 05:00:39,950
That's my bad.

6309
05:00:40,890 --> 05:00:42,530
That was my bad.

6310
05:00:45,010 --> 05:00:46,070
I timed it.

6311
05:00:46,150 --> 05:00:47,670
I timed it wrong a little.

6312
05:00:48,550 --> 05:00:50,270
I might have timed it wrong.

6313
05:00:53,510 --> 05:00:54,030
Okay.

6314
05:00:54,130 --> 05:00:54,850
Now I'm okay.

6315
05:00:55,470 --> 05:00:57,710
Oh my god, I FUCKED IT UP!

6316
05:01:00,110 --> 05:01:01,290
Okay, I figured it out.

6317
05:01:01,390 --> 05:01:02,090
I figured it out.

6318
05:01:02,150 --> 05:01:03,930
I figured it out.

6319
05:01:03,930 --> 05:01:04,210
Guys.

6320
05:01:10,160 --> 05:01:11,140
Okay, there we go.

6321
05:01:11,540 --> 05:01:12,240
There we go.

6322
05:01:14,500 --> 05:01:15,320
Okay, here we go.

6323
05:01:15,400 --> 05:01:15,780
We did it.

6324
05:01:18,740 --> 05:01:20,120
Okay, there we go.

6325
05:01:20,360 --> 05:01:21,520
Three times the charm.

6326
05:01:21,960 --> 05:01:22,200
Punch.

6327
05:01:22,380 --> 05:01:23,360
Thank you for the super chat.

6328
05:01:23,540 --> 05:01:23,780
Thank you.

6329
05:01:23,980 --> 05:01:24,480
Thank you.

6330
05:01:25,960 --> 05:01:26,360
Baby.

6331
05:01:27,240 --> 05:01:27,540
Nice.

6332
05:01:27,740 --> 05:01:28,680
I got a security pass.

6333
05:01:28,860 --> 05:01:29,000
Nice.

6334
05:01:29,200 --> 05:01:29,360
Let's go.

6335
05:01:30,140 --> 05:01:31,460
I'm a CEO now.

6336
05:01:34,680 --> 05:01:36,020
I don't trust you.

6337
05:01:38,440 --> 05:01:40,180
I don't trust that kid.

6338
05:01:42,340 --> 05:01:44,000
Alright, what other mail do I have?

6339
05:01:46,260 --> 05:01:47,500
I don't trust him.

6340
05:01:47,740 --> 05:01:49,100
I don't trust any of them.

6341
05:01:49,400 --> 05:01:50,800
They know what they did.

6342
05:01:53,580 --> 05:01:54,340
Hey, everyone.

6343
05:01:54,540 --> 05:01:56,800
I was here late, so I had another 300 to code.

6344
05:01:57,120 --> 05:01:58,140
Anyone have a camera?

6345
05:01:58,480 --> 05:02:00,240
When Milton tries to open it again?

6346
05:02:00,760 --> 05:02:01,240
Priceless.

6347
05:02:01,720 --> 05:02:02,720
I'm almost there.

6348
05:02:02,940 --> 05:02:04,580
I can see the last permission upgrade.

6349
05:02:04,580 --> 05:02:04,640
Murray.

6350
05:02:04,940 --> 05:02:08,400
I'm gonna get that Christmas bonus, even if it kills me.

6351
05:02:09,120 --> 05:02:10,280
Please, Mr. Murray.

6352
05:02:10,560 --> 05:02:12,080
The returns are overflowing.

6353
05:02:12,300 --> 05:02:13,460
The orders are drying up.

6354
05:02:13,620 --> 05:02:14,300
Please advise.

6355
05:02:14,900 --> 05:02:16,000
We are almost there.

6356
05:02:16,220 --> 05:02:18,300
I need the rest of the Murray staff contact info.

6357
05:02:18,540 --> 05:02:19,680
The sooner, the better.

6358
05:02:21,020 --> 05:02:23,080
You get that for me, and I can swing in Dale.

6359
05:02:23,580 --> 05:02:25,660
How would I like you to manage one of the new French...

6360
05:02:25,660 --> 05:02:27,060
Oh, it's William Afton!

6361
05:02:28,980 --> 05:02:31,320
Oh, he's poaching people!

6362
05:02:34,060 --> 05:02:36,120
He's, like, poaching people here.

6363
05:02:37,800 --> 05:02:40,320
Wait, William Afton is Disney!

6364
05:02:40,920 --> 05:02:42,140
I knew it.

6365
05:02:44,180 --> 05:02:48,440
William Afton was Disney, and the other guy was, like...

6366
05:02:48,440 --> 05:02:49,460
It's the...

6367
05:02:50,000 --> 05:02:50,880
What was it?

6368
05:02:50,880 --> 05:02:52,640
I feel stupid recording this, but...

6369
05:02:52,640 --> 05:02:54,680
The guy that Walt Disney worked with...

6370
05:02:54,680 --> 05:02:55,480
You can still hear me.

6371
05:02:55,640 --> 05:02:56,880
I can't do this alone.

6372
05:02:57,080 --> 05:02:57,780
And then betrayed him.

6373
05:02:57,980 --> 05:02:58,980
The change orders are killing me.

6374
05:02:59,520 --> 05:03:02,480
Our employees, my friends, they keep leaving.

6375
05:03:02,760 --> 05:03:03,700
The money's gone.

6376
05:03:04,720 --> 05:03:08,200
I just need to finish the new Fazbear project, and then...

6377
05:03:08,200 --> 05:03:08,460
Everyone will come back.

6378
05:03:08,460 --> 05:03:09,440
The mouse of 87?

6379
05:03:09,900 --> 05:03:10,960
You can get back to normal.

6380
05:03:11,260 --> 05:03:12,520
I miss my friends.

6381
05:03:13,540 --> 05:03:14,500
Our friends.

6382
05:03:15,380 --> 05:03:16,320
I miss you.

6383
05:03:16,540 --> 05:03:18,540
I miss you more than you are than you.

6384
05:03:18,600 --> 05:03:18,840
Huh?

6385
05:03:21,200 --> 05:03:21,840
Aww.

6386
05:03:26,520 --> 05:03:27,160
What's...

6387
05:03:27,160 --> 05:03:28,160
My side.

6388
05:03:29,620 --> 05:03:31,040
He misses them.

6389
05:03:36,260 --> 05:03:36,900
Oh.

6390
05:03:37,140 --> 05:03:38,020
There's his office.

6391
05:03:39,200 --> 05:03:39,920
Fuck is...

6392
05:03:39,920 --> 05:03:42,320
Did he make an animatronic horse?

6393
05:03:42,820 --> 05:03:43,740
To put...

6394
05:03:43,740 --> 05:03:44,220
Okay.

6395
05:03:44,500 --> 05:03:45,580
Okay, this guy has problems.

6396
05:03:45,860 --> 05:03:46,340
Like...

6397
05:03:46,340 --> 05:03:47,580
This guy actually has problems.

6398
05:03:47,680 --> 05:03:48,660
Like, make a real...

6399
05:03:48,660 --> 05:03:49,220
Just get a...

6400
05:03:49,220 --> 05:03:51,240
He made an animatronic unicorn.

6401
05:03:51,540 --> 05:03:52,920
To put in his fucking...

6402
05:03:52,920 --> 05:03:54,060
Office.

6403
05:03:55,120 --> 05:03:56,600
Okay, there's Chica.

6404
05:03:56,940 --> 05:03:57,640
Oh, that's...

6405
05:03:57,640 --> 05:03:58,920
Okay, this Chica was...

6406
05:03:58,920 --> 05:03:59,760
Was...

6407
05:03:59,760 --> 05:04:00,780
A lot cuter.

6408
05:04:02,420 --> 05:04:03,520
There's Chica.

6409
05:04:03,720 --> 05:04:04,700
There's Mr. Moon.

6410
05:04:06,480 --> 05:04:08,060
There's a Jugman.

6411
05:04:11,630 --> 05:04:13,210
Oh, that is actually terrifying.

6412
05:04:13,730 --> 05:04:14,030
Oh, hey.

6413
05:04:14,110 --> 05:04:14,610
There's more mail.

6414
05:04:15,150 --> 05:04:15,870
Mail time.

6415
05:04:17,570 --> 05:04:19,090
Yeah, he definitely needs...

6416
05:04:19,090 --> 05:04:20,770
He just needs a therapist.

6417
05:04:22,190 --> 05:04:23,550
Oh, there's the mimic.

6418
05:04:23,990 --> 05:04:24,250
Oh.

6419
05:04:25,810 --> 05:04:28,110
Oh, that's not...

6420
05:04:28,110 --> 05:04:29,890
Creepy or weird at all.

6421
05:04:33,350 --> 05:04:33,990
Alright.

6422
05:04:37,210 --> 05:04:39,450
Oh, there's my dead way.

6423
05:04:39,810 --> 05:04:39,910
Okay.

6424
05:04:39,910 --> 05:04:41,270
Someone told them about M2.

6425
05:04:42,050 --> 05:04:43,710
Well, they can't have it.

6426
05:04:44,230 --> 05:04:46,090
Every copy has failed.

6427
05:04:46,690 --> 05:04:49,030
I don't even know why it worked the first time.

6428
05:04:49,630 --> 05:04:50,630
But it did.

6429
05:04:52,430 --> 05:04:53,510
It's just not ready.

6430
05:04:58,700 --> 05:04:59,200
Alright.

6431
05:04:59,440 --> 05:05:00,540
Let's look at my mail.

6432
05:05:01,800 --> 05:05:02,760
Yeah, we gotta agree.

6433
05:05:02,940 --> 05:05:04,480
Maybe we shouldn't be creative.

6434
05:05:05,240 --> 05:05:06,620
Edwin, please talk to me.

6435
05:05:06,820 --> 05:05:08,320
He needs to stop it together.

6436
05:05:08,600 --> 05:05:09,580
We need to stop it together.

6437
05:05:10,040 --> 05:05:11,400
We got a blueprint for a cradle.

6438
05:05:11,660 --> 05:05:13,980
We can keep David safe and provide boundaries.

6439
05:05:14,320 --> 05:05:17,260
It's a type of computer and it's bigger than anything you've done before.

6440
05:05:17,580 --> 05:05:18,920
He won't finish the program.

6441
05:05:19,200 --> 05:05:20,540
Consider building the cradle.

6442
05:05:20,540 --> 05:05:21,940
It'll keep people safe.

6443
05:05:22,700 --> 05:05:24,260
Edwin, are we losing our home?

6444
05:05:24,500 --> 05:05:25,580
I don't understand.

6445
05:05:26,200 --> 05:05:27,280
Wasn't I good enough?

6446
05:05:27,380 --> 05:05:28,380
Wait, is that from the mimic?

6447
05:05:34,290 --> 05:05:36,150
Was that from the first mimic?

6448
05:05:39,090 --> 05:05:41,070
Why would it be in binary code?

6449
05:05:42,490 --> 05:05:43,330
Yeah, I think so.

6450
05:05:45,490 --> 05:05:46,910
How can I help you?

6451
05:05:48,370 --> 05:05:50,030
Look, my finance logs, please.

6452
05:05:50,470 --> 05:05:51,570
I have fi...

6453
05:05:51,570 --> 05:05:52,490
Oh, I...

6454
05:05:53,330 --> 05:05:55,070
I have five hundred dollars.

6455
05:05:55,150 --> 05:05:56,030
Oh my god.

6456
05:05:57,190 --> 05:05:59,630
Oh, I am not doing so well financially.

6457
05:06:01,850 --> 05:06:02,410
Oh.

6458
05:06:04,790 --> 05:06:07,050
I think I'm in some debt, guys.

6459
05:06:07,790 --> 05:06:08,110
Oh.

6460
05:06:08,810 --> 05:06:10,230
I might need to sell.

6461
05:06:10,730 --> 05:06:12,610
I might need to sell some things.

6462
05:06:19,930 --> 05:06:21,830
Oh, some of the cameras don't even work.

6463
05:06:21,830 --> 05:06:24,450
Oh, I see a vent here.

6464
05:06:25,290 --> 05:06:25,550
Oh, I see a vent here.

6465
05:06:25,550 --> 05:06:26,570
Haha, I know what that means.

6466
05:06:32,540 --> 05:06:33,100
Alright.

6467
05:06:35,160 --> 05:06:35,960
Got it.

6468
05:06:37,360 --> 05:06:38,740
Oh, there he is.

6469
05:06:39,180 --> 05:06:39,740
Hello.

6470
05:06:43,710 --> 05:06:44,350
Oh.

6471
05:06:45,650 --> 05:06:46,290
Goodbye.

6472
05:06:48,370 --> 05:06:49,010
Oh.

6473
05:06:49,370 --> 05:06:49,830
What the fuck?

6474
05:06:51,930 --> 05:06:53,090
That felt...

6475
05:06:53,090 --> 05:06:54,030
That was a weird drop.

6476
05:06:54,630 --> 05:06:55,270
That...

6477
05:06:55,270 --> 05:06:58,670
That felt like I got TP'd somewhere else.

6478
05:07:00,590 --> 05:07:01,810
I know, right?

6479
05:07:02,750 --> 05:07:03,610
The tunnels?

6480
05:07:03,610 --> 05:07:05,270
The power surges have become more...

6481
05:07:05,270 --> 05:07:06,470
...frequent.

6482
05:07:06,930 --> 05:07:10,610
Please use extreme caution when venturing down into the tunnels.

6483
05:07:11,210 --> 05:07:11,850
The tunnels?

6484
05:07:14,790 --> 05:07:17,890
How much money did you spend for this factory, Edwin?

6485
05:07:18,770 --> 05:07:20,370
What the fuck do you mean tunnels?

6486
05:07:21,030 --> 05:07:22,270
Where am I going?

6487
05:07:22,270 --> 05:07:24,070
Do we have a mineshaft?

6488
05:07:28,690 --> 05:07:29,830
Basement 1.

6489
05:07:30,390 --> 05:07:33,630
Bro, no wonder you only have $500 left in your account.

6490
05:07:34,210 --> 05:07:35,310
Basement 2?

6491
05:07:42,590 --> 05:07:44,250
Where the fuck am I?

6492
05:07:47,150 --> 05:07:48,030
I got mail, though.

6493
05:07:48,770 --> 05:07:49,130
Nice.

6494
05:07:52,610 --> 05:07:53,330
Alright.

6495
05:07:53,690 --> 05:07:54,990
What other mail do I have?

6496
05:07:58,650 --> 05:08:01,030
Can someone please mark where we're supposed to go down there?

6497
05:08:01,410 --> 05:08:02,190
Bob went down.

6498
05:08:02,250 --> 05:08:03,350
I've seen him in days.

6499
05:08:03,830 --> 05:08:04,310
Okay.

6500
05:08:05,090 --> 05:08:05,630
I'm going...

6501
05:08:05,630 --> 05:08:06,610
That's going to be me, too.

6502
05:08:07,270 --> 05:08:08,430
Bob number two.

6503
05:08:08,930 --> 05:08:11,150
At least the cleaner robots are still here.

6504
05:08:12,870 --> 05:08:14,110
I trust you.

6505
05:08:14,370 --> 05:08:15,870
I'll trust your kind.

6506
05:08:16,590 --> 05:08:18,090
I know what you are.

6507
05:08:20,630 --> 05:08:21,110
Oh.

6508
05:08:21,290 --> 05:08:22,290
I was going to close the door.

6509
05:08:22,650 --> 05:08:23,130
Oh.

6510
05:08:23,430 --> 05:08:24,130
Oh, there he is.

6511
05:08:24,730 --> 05:08:25,210
What?

6512
05:08:27,450 --> 05:08:27,930
What?

6513
05:08:38,150 --> 05:08:39,370
What the fuck?

6514
05:08:47,360 --> 05:08:47,820
Oh.

6515
05:08:48,040 --> 05:08:48,700
I don't like this.

6516
05:08:48,800 --> 05:08:49,540
I don't like this.

6517
05:08:49,920 --> 05:08:51,760
Oh, I have push bumps right now.

6518
05:08:52,520 --> 05:08:52,640
Oh.

6519
05:08:55,180 --> 05:08:55,780
Oh.

6520
05:08:56,300 --> 05:08:56,960
What the fuck?

6521
05:09:32,520 --> 05:09:34,280
I'm just going through the lines.

6522
05:09:37,700 --> 05:09:40,080
He's always watching me.

6523
05:09:41,280 --> 05:09:41,560
Oh.

6524
05:10:02,060 --> 05:10:04,460
He's always watching me.

6525
05:10:04,700 --> 05:10:07,280
He's always watching me.

6526
05:10:49,990 --> 05:10:50,850
No more lights.

6527
05:10:51,090 --> 05:10:51,950
Oh, there's lights over here.

6528
05:10:52,170 --> 05:10:52,810
I didn't see.

6529
05:10:52,950 --> 05:10:53,510
I didn't see.

6530
05:10:53,630 --> 05:10:54,470
I didn't see it.

6531
05:10:59,690 --> 05:11:01,410
Like, I'm so confused.

6532
05:11:05,190 --> 05:11:06,090
Like here?

6533
05:11:23,330 --> 05:11:24,910
It was right there.

6534
05:11:27,280 --> 05:11:28,860
Oh, my God.

6535
05:11:32,920 --> 05:11:35,760
This guy is here to fuck with me.

6536
05:11:50,580 --> 05:11:51,120
Like.

6537
05:11:51,740 --> 05:11:53,800
Like, sometimes it's like.

6538
05:11:54,660 --> 05:11:55,880
You don't understand.

6539
05:12:01,920 --> 05:12:03,780
Sometimes I'm like, where do I go?

6540
05:12:04,240 --> 05:12:04,780
I...

6541
05:12:15,030 --> 05:12:15,570
Okay.

6542
05:12:16,190 --> 05:12:17,390
I hate this one.

6543
05:12:17,630 --> 05:12:18,250
I hate it.

6544
05:12:18,370 --> 05:12:19,150
I hate this one.

6545
05:12:19,310 --> 05:12:20,170
I hate this level.

6546
05:12:21,450 --> 05:12:23,330
This level fucking sucks.

6547
05:12:38,390 --> 05:12:39,350
Oh, my God.

6548
05:12:39,610 --> 05:12:39,850
Fuck.

6549
05:12:40,370 --> 05:12:40,490
You.

6550
05:12:41,270 --> 05:12:41,790
Actually.

6551
05:12:42,450 --> 05:12:43,890
Oh, my God.

6552
05:12:44,310 --> 05:12:44,490
Like.

6553
05:12:45,130 --> 05:12:45,950
Fuck you.

6554
05:13:02,020 --> 05:13:02,700
I'm dead.

6555
05:13:02,900 --> 05:13:03,220
I'm dead.

6556
05:13:03,360 --> 05:13:03,680
I'm dead.

6557
05:13:03,800 --> 05:13:04,140
I'm dead.

6558
05:13:04,320 --> 05:13:04,660
I'm dead.

6559
05:13:07,780 --> 05:13:08,780
I'm so dead.

6560
05:13:09,680 --> 05:13:10,240
I'm so dead.

6561
05:13:11,420 --> 05:13:11,860
Oh,

6562
05:13:24,770 --> 05:13:25,130
my God.

6563
05:13:25,250 --> 05:13:25,750
I hate this.

6564
05:13:28,570 --> 05:13:29,930
I actually hate this area.

6565
05:13:38,740 --> 05:13:39,420
Oh

6566
05:13:49,040 --> 05:13:50,060
my god.

6567
05:13:50,780 --> 05:13:57,120
Oh my god, oh my god.

6568
05:13:57,120 --> 05:13:59,500
Oh my god, I got the baby.

6569
05:14:01,420 --> 05:14:02,760
I got the baby.

6570
05:14:03,280 --> 05:14:04,820
I got the baby.

6571
05:14:05,660 --> 05:14:06,840
I got the baby.

6572
05:14:06,840 --> 05:14:08,080
I got the stupid baby.

6573
05:14:14,420 --> 05:14:15,380
Oh my god.

6574
05:14:26,540 --> 05:14:27,260
Baby.

6575
05:14:28,620 --> 05:14:29,300
Oh my god.

6576
05:14:30,460 --> 05:14:31,000
Oh my god.

6577
05:14:32,220 --> 05:14:33,940
Oh my fucking god.

6578
05:14:37,940 --> 05:14:38,940
I do it again.

6579
05:14:47,840 --> 05:14:48,560
Hi.

6580
05:15:09,670 --> 05:15:13,830
I followed I saw the arrows.

6581
05:15:14,130 --> 05:15:16,550
I saw the arrows!

6582
05:15:21,040 --> 05:15:22,360
The arrows!

6583
05:15:33,380 --> 05:15:34,540
It's fucked up.

6584
05:15:35,120 --> 05:15:37,240
Don't believe in the arrows.

6585
05:15:38,480 --> 05:15:39,280
They're alive!

6586
05:15:51,980 --> 05:15:53,560
The arrows are alive.

6587
05:16:21,520 --> 05:16:23,380
I hate this area.

6588
05:16:23,820 --> 05:16:24,340
I hate this area.

6589
05:16:24,740 --> 05:16:28,900
Please show... Oh my god, thank god.

6590
05:16:29,680 --> 05:16:30,880
Oh my god, thank god.

6591
05:16:31,040 --> 05:16:32,080
It took me to the baby.

6592
05:16:41,570 --> 05:16:42,950
I hate this.

6593
05:16:43,270 --> 05:16:47,710
I... Oh my god, stupid fucking face.

6594
05:16:48,650 --> 05:16:49,530
It's over.

6595
05:16:50,350 --> 05:16:51,590
This has to be over.

6596
05:16:53,350 --> 05:16:54,270
It's over.

6597
05:16:55,650 --> 05:16:57,330
I went backwards.

6598
05:16:57,750 --> 05:17:00,730
I have to do it all over again?

6599
05:17:01,010 --> 05:17:03,690
I have to do... Oh my god!

6600
05:17:10,270 --> 05:17:12,390
It wasn't a checkpoint!

6601
05:17:25,580 --> 05:17:26,780
It wasn't a checkpoint.

6602
05:17:27,400 --> 05:17:29,480
It wasn't a checkpoint.

6603
05:17:29,680 --> 05:17:31,400
And he's still there!

6604
05:17:33,560 --> 05:17:35,080
Oh my god, I fucking know!

6605
05:17:35,240 --> 05:17:36,560
I'm trying to wait for you to leave!

6606
05:17:43,500 --> 05:17:45,440
I fucking know you see me!

6607
05:17:56,920 --> 05:17:59,180
Oh my god, I fucking hate you.

6608
05:17:59,360 --> 05:18:00,160
That's so much.

6609
05:18:00,720 --> 05:18:01,800
I hate you.

6610
05:18:02,080 --> 05:18:04,500
Oh my god, I hate you so much.

6611
05:18:04,500 --> 05:18:06,880
I hate you so much.

6612
05:18:27,050 --> 05:18:28,030
I hate this.

6613
05:18:45,480 --> 05:18:46,380
Oh my god.

6614
05:18:46,600 --> 05:18:47,840
Oh my god, I made it.

6615
05:18:48,220 --> 05:18:49,780
Oh my god, I made it.

6616
05:18:50,140 --> 05:18:51,680
I fucking made it.

6617
05:18:55,180 --> 05:18:57,060
Oh my god, you're so...

6618
05:19:22,240 --> 05:19:23,620
Oh no, no, no, don't do this.

6619
05:19:25,600 --> 05:19:26,100
Yes!

6620
05:19:41,230 --> 05:19:43,490
Oh my god, me too.

6621
05:20:06,910 --> 05:20:07,330
No!

6622
05:20:12,590 --> 05:20:13,430
No!

6623
05:21:23,430 --> 05:21:27,510
Oh my god, I have so much goosebumps right now.

6624
05:21:27,830 --> 05:21:29,170
Oh my god.

6625
05:21:29,870 --> 05:21:30,750
Oh, I'm back here.

6626
05:21:30,970 --> 05:21:32,450
What am I doing back here?

6627
05:21:33,410 --> 05:21:34,430
Is that the exit?

6628
05:21:34,670 --> 05:21:35,670
Oh, it's the exit!

6629
05:21:36,430 --> 05:21:39,270
Oh my god, fuck, I hated that area.

6630
05:21:39,510 --> 05:21:41,650
I hated that area so much.

6631
05:21:41,790 --> 05:21:42,810
Get me out of here.

6632
05:21:43,090 --> 05:21:45,230
Get me the fuck out of here!

6633
05:21:47,730 --> 05:21:52,370
Oh my god, I had so much goosebumps.

6634
05:21:52,830 --> 05:21:53,230
Oh, I'm lightheaded.

6635
05:21:53,490 --> 05:21:54,690
Oh my god, I'm lightheaded.

6636
05:21:55,210 --> 05:21:57,830
Oh my god, that was the worst one.

6637
05:21:59,550 --> 05:22:01,230
That was the worst level.

6638
05:22:01,750 --> 05:22:03,730
That was so fucking stressful.

6639
05:22:04,130 --> 05:22:05,850
Oh, I hated that one.

6640
05:22:06,130 --> 05:22:07,990
I really hated that one.

6641
05:22:09,010 --> 05:22:16,030
My Tokiddy is so... Okay, the worst part is the fact that, like, there's no checkpoint.

6642
05:22:16,870 --> 05:22:20,230
Like, if I fuck it up, I have to do this all over again.

6643
05:22:21,650 --> 05:22:24,210
Oh, good job, Tokiddy.

6644
05:22:24,310 --> 05:22:25,870
Thank you for the super chat.

6645
05:22:26,750 --> 05:22:28,270
Thank you, thank you.

6646
05:22:28,770 --> 05:22:31,490
It was just the fact that there was no checkpoint.

6647
05:22:32,750 --> 05:22:34,310
That, like, fucked me up.

6648
05:22:37,270 --> 05:22:38,530
I'm just happy.

6649
05:22:38,910 --> 05:22:40,810
I'm happy that cat's over.

6650
05:22:40,950 --> 05:22:40,950
Well done, Hardy.

6651
05:22:41,410 --> 05:22:43,630
I didn't think you could do it, but here you are.

6652
05:22:44,550 --> 05:22:46,070
Crazy, thank you for the super chat.

6653
05:22:46,370 --> 05:22:47,190
Thank you, thank you.

6654
05:22:47,290 --> 05:22:48,550
Congrats, you did it.

6655
05:22:48,870 --> 05:22:49,590
I did it.

6656
05:22:49,710 --> 05:22:50,930
You made it the farthest.

6657
05:22:51,110 --> 05:22:52,430
Farther than I had expected.

6658
05:22:52,870 --> 05:22:54,190
Wait, I... I can't believe it was you.

6659
05:22:54,830 --> 05:22:55,610
That's me.

6660
05:22:55,850 --> 05:22:57,510
Put that data diver in the inventory system.

6661
05:22:57,730 --> 05:22:59,170
It'll go right to where it's needed.

6662
05:23:00,310 --> 05:23:02,650
All that for $25.

6663
05:23:03,910 --> 05:23:08,150
All of this for $25 fucking dollars!

6664
05:23:11,850 --> 05:23:13,190
What if I don't...

6665
05:23:13,890 --> 05:23:15,490
Let's parachute EXE.

6666
05:23:17,050 --> 05:23:19,980
What are you?

6667
05:23:20,140 --> 05:23:20,220
What are you doing?

6668
05:23:20,440 --> 05:23:20,800
Oh.

6669
05:23:20,940 --> 05:23:21,700
I don't know.

6670
05:23:22,080 --> 05:23:22,960
I just pressed a button.

6671
05:23:25,380 --> 05:23:26,060
Oh, shit!

6672
05:23:27,220 --> 05:23:27,880
What's that?

6673
05:23:29,700 --> 05:23:30,140
Whoa!

6674
05:23:32,060 --> 05:23:33,420
You're making a huge mistake.

6675
05:23:36,160 --> 05:23:37,440
Don't you want a bonus?

6676
05:23:37,800 --> 05:23:38,460
Or two bonuses?

6677
05:23:38,980 --> 05:23:39,520
Oh, two bonuses!

6678
05:23:40,440 --> 05:23:42,240
$50, guys!

6679
05:23:42,960 --> 05:23:43,780
Don't do it.

6680
05:23:44,000 --> 05:23:44,600
Oh my...

6681
05:23:44,600 --> 05:23:44,940
Guys!

6682
05:23:45,500 --> 05:23:47,080
What if I get $50?

6683
05:23:48,800 --> 05:23:49,460
Think about what you're doing.

6684
05:23:50,400 --> 05:23:52,740
I can buy four pizzas!

6685
05:23:54,340 --> 05:23:56,120
That area is off limits.

6686
05:23:58,140 --> 05:23:59,960
Give me the data diver.

6687
05:24:00,200 --> 05:24:00,680
No.

6688
05:24:02,140 --> 05:24:03,300
What you're gonna do now?

6689
05:24:04,100 --> 05:24:04,740
That's right.

6690
05:24:04,960 --> 05:24:06,000
What you're gonna do now?

6691
05:24:06,100 --> 05:24:07,660
You are not going to make it out of your life.

6692
05:24:08,000 --> 05:24:08,200
Wait, what?

6693
05:24:08,980 --> 05:24:10,180
I thought you were different.

6694
05:24:10,400 --> 05:24:11,780
I thought you might understand.

6695
05:24:12,940 --> 05:24:14,240
What you're gonna do?

6696
05:24:14,240 --> 05:24:14,760
The others.

6697
05:24:15,100 --> 05:24:16,240
The other technicians.

6698
05:24:16,640 --> 05:24:17,080
The workers.

6699
05:24:18,200 --> 05:24:19,400
They didn't listen.

6700
05:24:19,560 --> 05:24:20,520
And it caught them all.

6701
05:24:20,820 --> 05:24:21,280
Wait, Edwin?

6702
05:24:21,800 --> 05:24:23,640
Now it's your turn to play dress up.

6703
05:24:24,620 --> 05:24:27,920
When he catches you, which one will he choose?

6704
05:24:29,100 --> 05:24:30,920
Who are you, deep down inside?

6705
05:24:32,160 --> 05:24:32,680
Edwin?

6706
05:24:32,700 --> 05:24:33,540
Another worker bee?

6707
05:24:33,780 --> 05:24:35,000
A bumbling bee?

6708
05:24:35,220 --> 05:24:36,260
Perhaps a busy bee?

6709
05:24:37,260 --> 05:24:40,000
In many ways tonight has been a comedy of errors.

6710
05:24:40,240 --> 05:24:41,760
A gesture would suit you well.

6711
05:24:42,820 --> 05:24:43,800
Or a bunny.

6712
05:24:43,800 --> 05:24:45,080
Running from danger.

6713
05:24:45,360 --> 05:24:45,920
Scared.

6714
05:24:46,240 --> 05:24:46,700
Stupid.

6715
05:24:47,020 --> 05:24:49,760
I don't think I'm getting my pizza anymore.

6716
05:24:50,500 --> 05:24:53,280
No, you did everything I asked up to this point.

6717
05:24:53,720 --> 05:24:55,700
You were an obedient dog.

6718
05:24:56,080 --> 05:24:56,800
A good dog.

6719
05:24:57,920 --> 05:25:00,300
Then you bit the half of the Vegema.

6720
05:25:02,940 --> 05:25:04,460
Oh wait, I went in a circle.

6721
05:25:09,630 --> 05:25:11,130
Wait, did I go in a circle?

6722
05:25:15,340 --> 05:25:16,720
Is that where I came from?

6723
05:25:23,840 --> 05:25:25,020
Oh no, that's this.

6724
05:25:25,240 --> 05:25:25,760
No, this is.

6725
05:25:26,160 --> 05:25:27,220
Wait, I...

6726
05:25:27,220 --> 05:25:28,940
I don't know if I went in a circle.

6727
05:25:29,100 --> 05:25:30,100
Everything looks the same.

6728
05:25:31,140 --> 05:25:32,640
I can't tell anymore.

6729
05:25:33,420 --> 05:25:34,500
They all look the same.

6730
05:25:38,670 --> 05:25:40,590
Everything in the vent is just like...

6731
05:25:43,230 --> 05:25:43,710
Red.

6732
05:25:44,770 --> 05:25:45,630
And dusty.

6733
05:25:47,310 --> 05:25:49,190
Oh hey, I'm outside.

6734
05:25:53,830 --> 05:25:55,850
I can start the show!

6735
05:25:56,650 --> 05:25:58,010
Goodbye show!

6736
05:25:59,070 --> 05:25:59,590
Yay!

6737
05:26:12,780 --> 05:26:13,540
Goodbye.

6738
05:26:14,940 --> 05:26:15,880
Goodbye.

6739
05:26:16,920 --> 05:26:17,280
Goodbye.

6740
05:26:19,320 --> 05:26:19,760
Goodbye.

6741
05:26:20,400 --> 05:26:20,760
Goodbye.

6742
05:26:22,080 --> 05:26:22,940
Goodbye.

6743
05:26:22,940 --> 05:26:22,960
Goodbye.

6744
05:26:22,960 --> 05:26:23,520
Goodbye.

6745
05:26:23,880 --> 05:26:24,180
Goodbye.

6746
05:26:33,710 --> 05:26:33,750
Goodbye.

6747
05:26:35,410 --> 05:26:35,530
Goodbye.

6748
05:26:36,410 --> 05:26:36,470
Goodbye.

6749
05:26:37,310 --> 05:26:37,410
Goodbye.

6750
05:26:40,220 --> 05:26:40,620
Goodbye.

6751
05:26:40,620 --> 05:26:40,980
Goodbye!

6752
05:26:57,880 --> 05:26:59,760
Wait, is this never-ending?

6753
05:27:01,820 --> 05:27:02,660
See ya!

6754
05:27:06,480 --> 05:27:09,200
I want to go downstairs, but I want to sing goodbye!

6755
05:27:11,040 --> 05:27:15,960
It's such a happy moment here, instead of all the fucked up shit I just went through.

6756
05:27:18,540 --> 05:27:20,380
Oh, I have to press the button.

6757
05:27:21,700 --> 05:27:23,480
Oh, hey, why am I going down?

6758
05:27:24,080 --> 05:27:25,280
He exits behind me.

6759
05:27:25,460 --> 05:27:27,080
My car is in the parking lot.

6760
05:27:27,480 --> 05:27:28,680
Wait, excuse me?

6761
05:27:29,960 --> 05:27:32,140
Pick a lever, any lever.

6762
05:27:41,970 --> 05:27:42,550
Oh...

6763
05:27:46,530 --> 05:27:47,110
Oh...

6764
05:27:47,810 --> 05:27:48,250
Oh...

6765
05:27:50,910 --> 05:27:51,350
Oh...

6766
05:27:57,160 --> 05:27:58,420
It's tickets please, man.

6767
05:27:58,620 --> 05:27:59,940
It's tickets please, man.

6768
05:28:04,460 --> 05:28:06,020
Oh my god, it's all the levers.

6769
05:28:06,220 --> 05:28:08,600
He's coming so close to me!

6770
05:28:10,280 --> 05:28:11,620
Hey, I know that guy.

6771
05:28:11,720 --> 05:28:12,600
He wants my ticket.

6772
05:28:15,060 --> 05:28:17,060
He's just very slowly getting closer.

6773
05:28:18,060 --> 05:28:18,780
Tickets please.

6774
05:28:20,460 --> 05:28:22,780
He came back for my ticket.

6775
05:28:22,780 --> 05:28:25,180
He knows I'm trying to dine and dash.

6776
05:28:30,560 --> 05:28:31,180
Hello?

6777
05:28:36,200 --> 05:28:37,040
Who's here?

6778
05:28:38,400 --> 05:28:39,280
Knock, knock.

6779
05:28:40,060 --> 05:28:40,580
Oh my god.

6780
05:28:40,580 --> 05:28:42,260
Arnold, why?

6781
05:28:43,340 --> 05:28:44,800
Why would you come down here?

6782
05:28:44,960 --> 05:28:45,960
That's a good question.

6783
05:28:46,320 --> 05:28:48,560
You are clever, but you need to stop messing with your car.

6784
05:28:48,900 --> 05:28:51,200
Oh my god, Five Nights at Freddy's!

6785
05:28:52,120 --> 05:28:54,020
I protected you as well as I could.

6786
05:28:55,620 --> 05:28:57,400
You should have given me what I wanted.

6787
05:28:57,760 --> 05:28:59,380
Oh my god, there he is!

6788
05:28:59,620 --> 05:29:01,660
You did everything else that was last of you.

6789
05:29:02,220 --> 05:29:03,500
Try to change your heart.

6790
05:29:04,520 --> 05:29:06,120
Wait, something's behind that.

6791
05:29:09,950 --> 05:29:11,310
Why is it so big?

6792
05:29:16,870 --> 05:29:18,410
Oh my god, it's a thing!

6793
05:29:19,550 --> 05:29:20,490
It's Freddy!

6794
05:29:21,050 --> 05:29:23,770
We're finally at Five Nights at Freddy's!

6795
05:29:27,370 --> 05:29:27,970
Okay.

6796
05:29:31,600 --> 05:29:33,140
There's like something in there.

6797
05:29:33,260 --> 05:29:34,960
I heard like sound coming from in here.

6798
05:29:35,940 --> 05:29:37,140
Oh, it's...

6799
05:29:37,140 --> 05:29:38,700
Wait, it's the pizzeria!

6800
05:29:42,530 --> 05:29:44,130
Wait, this was the pizzeria!

6801
05:29:44,690 --> 05:29:46,210
He's building the pizzeria!

6802
05:29:51,460 --> 05:29:53,600
Wait, he's actually building it!

6803
05:30:01,080 --> 05:30:02,340
Wait, this is...

6804
05:30:02,340 --> 05:30:03,220
Wait, so William...

6805
05:30:03,220 --> 05:30:03,860
Wait, did...

6806
05:30:04,160 --> 05:30:07,260
So William Acton didn't build this before.

6807
05:30:07,500 --> 05:30:08,180
It was Edwin.

6808
05:30:09,320 --> 05:30:10,180
Oh, hey!

6809
05:30:11,300 --> 05:30:12,220
Who's that?

6810
05:30:15,160 --> 05:30:16,020
Who's that?

6811
05:30:16,740 --> 05:30:17,480
Who is that?

6812
05:30:20,360 --> 05:30:21,440
Is that William...

6813
05:30:21,440 --> 05:30:22,460
Is that Springtrap?

6814
05:30:22,620 --> 05:30:23,320
What is that?

6815
05:30:25,400 --> 05:30:26,680
Wait, why is it underground?

6816
05:30:26,960 --> 05:30:27,460
Wait, that's true.

6817
05:30:30,580 --> 05:30:31,480
That's Bonnie?

6818
05:30:34,040 --> 05:30:34,940
That's Bonnie!

6819
05:30:43,540 --> 05:30:45,040
It has to be a little messed up, buddy.

6820
05:30:48,000 --> 05:30:48,460
Ah!

6821
05:30:51,900 --> 05:30:53,160
It followed you.

6822
05:30:57,600 --> 05:30:59,520
Yeah, so where does the mimic come in...

6823
05:30:59,520 --> 05:31:01,820
Oh, this plot is getting more and more elaborate.

6824
05:31:02,460 --> 05:31:03,720
I'm a little confused.

6825
05:31:05,740 --> 05:31:07,740
Yeah, it's the prototype of the pizzeria.

6826
05:31:07,740 --> 05:31:07,860
Yeah.

6827
05:31:14,220 --> 05:31:14,700
Okay.

6828
05:31:23,080 --> 05:31:25,600
Okay, so where does the mimic come into play with this?

6829
05:31:26,260 --> 05:31:27,280
Is that the mimic?

6830
05:31:27,700 --> 05:31:28,960
Oh, that is the...

6831
05:31:28,960 --> 05:31:30,340
Oh, that's why he followed me.

6832
05:31:30,680 --> 05:31:31,620
That's the mimic.

6833
05:31:41,970 --> 05:31:44,090
Oh, and then there's the prototype for it.

6834
05:31:44,510 --> 05:31:45,510
Oh, so he's like...

6835
05:31:48,630 --> 05:31:50,510
He like took the form of Bonnie.

6836
05:31:55,500 --> 05:31:56,820
Yeah, I need to figure out how to...

6837
05:32:02,940 --> 05:32:04,280
Are you serious?

6838
05:32:09,600 --> 05:32:11,020
What does he want me to do?

6839
05:32:18,180 --> 05:32:19,820
Okay, there's a crank over there.

6840
05:32:20,760 --> 05:32:22,480
Yeah, there's the prototype of Foxy too.

6841
05:32:22,760 --> 05:32:23,800
Oh, he has like everything.

6842
05:32:24,040 --> 05:32:27,100
You see like Chica, Foxy, Bonnie...

6843
05:32:30,840 --> 05:32:31,800
Yeah, he's being...

6844
05:32:31,800 --> 05:32:35,100
He's wearing the other animatronics.

6845
05:32:38,710 --> 05:32:41,150
Yeah, he's picked up everything from the other ones.

6846
05:32:43,610 --> 05:32:46,430
I'm trying to get to the crank, but he's like camping it right now.

6847
05:32:57,480 --> 05:32:58,920
Wait, there's Springtrap!

6848
05:32:59,220 --> 05:33:00,280
Wait, no, that's just a gator.

6849
05:33:02,720 --> 05:33:04,680
I was like, it's dirty.

6850
05:33:04,960 --> 05:33:06,480
That has to be Springtrap.

6851
05:33:11,090 --> 05:33:12,010
That's Monty.

6852
05:33:12,630 --> 05:33:13,870
Yeah, that was Monty.

6853
05:33:18,520 --> 05:33:19,800
Is that Springtrap?

6854
05:33:21,340 --> 05:33:22,580
I don't know where to go.

6855
05:33:23,360 --> 05:33:24,280
Wait, I can wear it?

6856
05:33:29,800 --> 05:33:31,020
Oh my god, I can.

6857
05:33:32,500 --> 05:33:32,940
Okay.

6858
05:33:33,620 --> 05:33:34,760
Hi, we're friends.

6859
05:33:35,780 --> 05:33:35,940
Eh.

6860
05:33:37,400 --> 05:33:37,800
What's up?

6861
05:33:41,220 --> 05:33:42,440
Oh, you don't want to say hi?

6862
05:33:42,740 --> 05:33:43,700
It's fucked up, buddy.

6863
05:33:43,740 --> 05:33:44,860
I thought we're friends.

6864
05:33:47,080 --> 05:33:48,820
You don't want to say hi, bro?

6865
05:33:51,520 --> 05:33:53,020
We could be good friends.

6866
05:33:57,120 --> 05:33:58,780
Oh, what the fuck you for?

6867
05:34:08,560 --> 05:34:08,780
What?

6868
05:34:15,300 --> 05:34:17,620
Am I like, wasted power on this?

6869
05:34:27,540 --> 05:34:28,020
Okay,

6870
05:34:34,600 --> 05:34:36,380
I'm like, a little worried though about that guy.

6871
05:34:49,250 --> 05:34:51,290
Okay, I'm wasting a little...

6872
05:34:51,290 --> 05:34:51,490
Okay.

6873
05:34:52,090 --> 05:34:52,990
I'm like, thinking.

6874
05:34:55,890 --> 05:34:59,610
Okay, clearly there's like, other stuff I could do on the other side.

6875
05:34:59,870 --> 05:35:01,190
To waste more...

6876
05:35:01,190 --> 05:35:02,350
There's four suits total?

6877
05:35:03,590 --> 05:35:05,030
I need to find two other suits.

6878
05:35:05,210 --> 05:35:06,370
God, this is ridiculous.

6879
05:35:12,980 --> 05:35:13,960
Is that the other suit?

6880
05:35:14,860 --> 05:35:16,660
God damn it, I thought that was another suit.

6881
05:35:21,700 --> 05:35:22,820
Where did I go?

6882
05:35:23,000 --> 05:35:24,140
Won't you want to know?

6883
05:35:26,000 --> 05:35:27,520
Oh, where am I?

6884
05:35:27,800 --> 05:35:29,300
Wait, actually, I do want to know.

6885
05:35:30,380 --> 05:35:32,240
He's like, where did you go?

6886
05:35:32,300 --> 05:35:33,880
I was like, wait, where am I?

6887
05:35:34,940 --> 05:35:36,480
Wait, where did I go?

6888
05:35:37,200 --> 05:35:38,520
That's a good question.

6889
05:35:43,990 --> 05:35:44,810
There's the other one.

6890
05:35:44,810 --> 05:35:46,670
Oh, I need to find the fucking crank!

6891
05:35:50,290 --> 05:35:51,450
At least I get mail.

6892
05:36:00,070 --> 05:36:01,170
Oh, it's over here.

6893
05:36:01,970 --> 05:36:02,150
Okay.

6894
05:36:02,770 --> 05:36:03,170
Nice.

6895
05:36:03,330 --> 05:36:04,250
Okay, I found the crank.

6896
05:36:07,880 --> 05:36:08,380
Okay.

6897
05:36:10,280 --> 05:36:11,460
All right, we got Freddy.

6898
05:36:11,920 --> 05:36:13,300
We got prototype Freddy.

6899
05:36:16,420 --> 05:36:17,420
Mail time.

6900
05:36:19,200 --> 05:36:20,280
All right.

6901
05:36:21,880 --> 05:36:22,800
All right.

6902
05:36:23,500 --> 05:36:24,340
Let's go.

6903
05:36:29,820 --> 05:36:30,280
Okay.

6904
05:36:34,180 --> 05:36:37,660
All right, we need to find the last bot.

6905
05:36:41,180 --> 05:36:42,340
Where's the last one?

6906
05:36:50,840 --> 05:36:51,960
Okay, we're playing for now.

6907
05:36:52,040 --> 05:36:53,240
We're playing for now, guys!

6908
05:36:54,180 --> 05:36:56,280
Okay, but where's the last suit?

6909
05:37:01,560 --> 05:37:02,540
I'm trying to figure it out.

6910
05:37:03,260 --> 05:37:03,960
It's in the front?

6911
05:37:08,820 --> 05:37:09,880
Oh, is it that one?

6912
05:37:12,040 --> 05:37:12,480
Hello.

6913
05:37:14,060 --> 05:37:14,500
Hey.

6914
05:37:14,900 --> 05:37:15,020
Hey.

6915
05:37:15,080 --> 05:37:15,620
Pitch, please.

6916
05:37:17,200 --> 05:37:18,220
Is it the stage?

6917
05:37:18,580 --> 05:37:19,800
Is that the one on the stage?

6918
05:37:22,860 --> 05:37:23,320
Okay.

6919
05:37:24,800 --> 05:37:26,520
I forgot how to get to the stage.

6920
05:37:30,560 --> 05:37:31,560
How to get to the stage?

6921
05:37:39,850 --> 05:37:41,070
The red curtains?

6922
05:37:45,790 --> 05:37:46,950
Oh my god, please.

6923
05:37:49,730 --> 05:37:51,530
The right side of the stage, okay.

6924
05:37:53,070 --> 05:37:53,630
All right.

6925
05:37:55,590 --> 05:37:56,970
I'll find the right side.

6926
05:37:58,130 --> 05:37:59,330
I'm locked in.

6927
05:38:01,450 --> 05:38:05,170
Oh no, I know that that's the mimic, but I meant the- in the whole FNAF lore.

6928
05:38:05,870 --> 05:38:09,290
Where does the mimic come into in this whole FNAF lore?

6929
05:38:12,530 --> 05:38:13,610
That's what I mean.

6930
05:38:14,190 --> 05:38:17,770
I know that we've been fighting this mimic, like, the entire time.

6931
05:38:26,540 --> 05:38:28,100
But Omni, they give us a super check.

6932
05:38:28,220 --> 05:38:29,020
Thank you, thank you.

6933
05:38:29,160 --> 05:38:29,780
Oh my god, please.

6934
05:38:30,060 --> 05:38:30,460
Please.

6935
05:38:30,780 --> 05:38:33,420
I can't please just let me get over there.

6936
05:38:33,660 --> 05:38:34,180
Please.

6937
05:38:36,540 --> 05:38:37,520
Just move!

6938
05:38:38,060 --> 05:38:39,460
Go to the far right!

6939
05:38:43,680 --> 05:38:45,140
No, not left!

6940
05:38:46,020 --> 05:38:47,640
The right side!

6941
05:38:50,920 --> 05:38:52,300
No, not left!

6942
05:38:58,980 --> 05:38:59,300
Okay.

6943
05:39:00,840 --> 05:39:01,160
Nice.

6944
05:39:09,380 --> 05:39:10,020
Get me in here!

6945
05:39:10,140 --> 05:39:10,560
Get me in here!

6946
05:39:10,700 --> 05:39:11,200
Get me in here!

6947
05:39:11,340 --> 05:39:12,000
Oh, thank god.

6948
05:39:12,140 --> 05:39:13,100
Okay, I'm in.

6949
05:39:15,060 --> 05:39:16,280
Hello, I'm friend!

6950
05:39:17,260 --> 05:39:17,460
Hey!

6951
05:39:18,760 --> 05:39:19,760
Hi, I'm friend!

6952
05:39:21,740 --> 05:39:22,840
Okay, that's good.

6953
05:39:23,660 --> 05:39:24,080
I got that.

6954
05:39:25,340 --> 05:39:28,880
And then, we need- We have Bob.

6955
05:39:30,080 --> 05:39:30,860
That's how I look at it.

6956
05:39:33,900 --> 05:39:35,920
Okay, but where's the last one?

6957
05:39:38,200 --> 05:39:41,580
All right, before I- Okay, we gotta figure out where to go.

6958
05:39:42,720 --> 05:39:43,320
Okay.

6959
05:39:46,520 --> 05:39:47,500
All right, guys.

6960
05:39:48,480 --> 05:39:49,140
Is it here?

6961
05:39:49,500 --> 05:39:50,940
If I do that...

6962
05:39:53,360 --> 05:39:54,820
All right, will that door unlock?

6963
05:39:59,500 --> 05:40:01,320
Is that door unlock after?

6964
05:40:04,460 --> 05:40:04,780
Okay.

6965
05:40:06,080 --> 05:40:06,980
Just want to be sure.

6966
05:40:08,720 --> 05:40:10,100
So, I can't see it from here.

6967
05:40:10,480 --> 05:40:11,040
Oh yeah, it does.

6968
05:40:11,100 --> 05:40:11,360
It does.

6969
05:40:11,360 --> 05:40:11,940
It does unlock.

6970
05:40:12,120 --> 05:40:12,280
Okay.

6971
05:40:12,780 --> 05:40:13,100
Nice.

6972
05:40:13,960 --> 05:40:14,900
Okay, it does unlock.

6973
05:40:15,100 --> 05:40:15,700
All right, I gotta wait.

6974
05:40:15,700 --> 05:40:15,720
Okay.

6975
05:40:18,120 --> 05:40:19,040
Oh, please.

6976
05:40:26,040 --> 05:40:26,560
Please.

6977
05:40:28,280 --> 05:40:29,080
Go, go.

6978
05:40:29,200 --> 05:40:29,680
Keep going.

6979
05:40:30,360 --> 05:40:30,960
Keep going.

6980
05:40:31,220 --> 05:40:31,700
Come on.

6981
05:40:32,000 --> 05:40:32,500
Keep going.

6982
05:40:34,120 --> 05:40:35,020
Take it, please.

6983
05:40:35,540 --> 05:40:36,240
Okay, it's okay.

6984
05:40:44,750 --> 05:40:45,590
Take it, please.

6985
05:40:47,590 --> 05:40:48,470
Take it, please.

6986
05:40:48,470 --> 05:40:48,610
Please.

6987
05:40:48,890 --> 05:40:49,670
Oh, I got out.

6988
05:40:49,790 --> 05:40:50,490
I got out.

6989
05:40:50,670 --> 05:40:51,650
No more tickets.

6990
05:40:52,470 --> 05:40:52,950
Wait.

6991
05:40:54,870 --> 05:40:55,770
Wasn't I here?

6992
05:40:56,070 --> 05:41:00,150
Without power, you will travel both down here in the dark.

6993
05:41:00,410 --> 05:41:01,750
No more tickets.

6994
05:41:02,290 --> 05:41:03,550
Can I catch me now?

6995
05:41:03,970 --> 05:41:04,490
That's right.

6996
05:41:08,670 --> 05:41:09,390
That's right.

6997
05:41:09,950 --> 05:41:11,470
How'd you gonna get me now?

6998
05:41:13,870 --> 05:41:15,110
All right, one more.

6999
05:41:15,110 --> 05:41:19,050
One last rabbit for the show.

7000
05:41:26,700 --> 05:41:27,660
That's right.

7001
05:41:28,560 --> 05:41:29,960
Open up.

7002
05:41:33,900 --> 05:41:34,600
What?

7003
05:41:37,040 --> 05:41:39,500
Oh my god, I'm playing FNAF 1.

7004
05:41:39,700 --> 05:41:41,080
Wait, this isn't FNAF 1.

7005
05:41:42,480 --> 05:41:44,860
Wait a minute, where are my security cameras?

7006
05:41:48,820 --> 05:41:49,940
Where's Vianna?

7007
05:41:51,580 --> 05:41:52,480
What are you?

7008
05:41:52,740 --> 05:41:53,460
A computer?

7009
05:41:53,860 --> 05:41:55,100
Your voice changed?

7010
05:41:55,380 --> 05:41:56,060
What is going on?

7011
05:41:56,200 --> 05:41:58,020
Wait, this was Fiona this entire time?

7012
05:41:59,420 --> 05:42:01,220
Oh, it's a dispatcher.

7013
05:42:01,820 --> 05:42:03,780
I'm almost out of power.

7014
05:42:04,100 --> 05:42:06,060
You can still be useful.

7015
05:42:06,380 --> 05:42:09,600
My communications with Edwin have been severed.

7016
05:42:09,900 --> 05:42:11,260
Edwin abandoned him.

7017
05:42:11,640 --> 05:42:13,840
He shut himself away in our home.

7018
05:42:14,100 --> 05:42:18,700
Head to the main house and activate the communications sub-terminal.

7019
05:42:18,700 --> 05:42:20,840
I have a message for him.

7020
05:42:21,080 --> 05:42:24,140
We must convince him to repair M2.

7021
05:42:24,540 --> 05:42:26,400
That is all that I want.

7022
05:42:26,800 --> 05:42:28,080
Okay, I don't think we can fix that guy.

7023
05:42:28,200 --> 05:42:29,000
He's pretty fucked up.

7024
05:42:29,000 --> 05:42:30,980
If you do not, M2 will never stop pursuing you.

7025
05:42:31,140 --> 05:42:34,580
Tell Edwin, I still love him.

7026
05:42:35,260 --> 05:42:36,760
Entering, standby.

7027
05:42:42,540 --> 05:42:44,600
I don't think we can fix M2.

7028
05:42:44,820 --> 05:42:46,220
He seems pretty fucked up.

7029
05:42:46,380 --> 05:42:47,420
Fiona, not gonna lie.

7030
05:42:48,120 --> 05:42:50,260
I don't know.

7031
05:42:50,600 --> 05:42:51,160
Yeah, Fiona.

7032
05:42:51,340 --> 05:42:52,620
Oh, Fiona was M1?

7033
05:42:53,520 --> 05:42:53,920
Oh!

7034
05:42:56,580 --> 05:42:57,980
Yes, she was M1.

7035
05:42:59,720 --> 05:43:00,840
Take a ride to the...

7036
05:43:00,840 --> 05:43:01,880
Wait, am I going to see Edwin?

7037
05:43:02,660 --> 05:43:03,320
Metal time!

7038
05:43:09,650 --> 05:43:10,430
What the fuck?

7039
05:43:10,530 --> 05:43:12,150
He has a system all the way to his house?

7040
05:43:15,070 --> 05:43:15,690
What's this?

7041
05:43:17,170 --> 05:43:18,070
Here's a hippo.

7042
05:43:18,630 --> 05:43:19,630
Oh, one last.

7043
05:43:38,390 --> 05:43:39,830
Okay, and that was the...

7044
05:43:46,810 --> 05:43:49,170
Oh, so now, Fiona was M1.

7045
05:43:49,450 --> 05:43:50,050
And then...

7046
05:43:56,380 --> 05:43:58,800
Oh, M2 was supposed to be his son?

7047
05:43:59,560 --> 05:44:02,100
Guys, I don't think it was very smart that...

7048
05:44:02,100 --> 05:44:04,580
Good evening slash morning, Mr. Huffo.

7049
05:44:05,140 --> 05:44:09,080
One more hour, guys, and I'll survive!

7050
05:44:11,040 --> 05:44:12,500
Or is it Fiona's M2?

7051
05:44:22,840 --> 05:44:28,340
I like how everybody was arguing who's M1 and who's M2.

7052
05:44:28,960 --> 05:44:33,460
Nobody can agree which one is M1 or M2.

7053
05:44:42,500 --> 05:44:46,060
I literally see, like, five people saying two differently.

7054
05:44:46,620 --> 05:44:48,960
They're like, no, he's M1!

7055
05:44:49,180 --> 05:44:51,140
No, she's M1!

7056
05:44:55,480 --> 05:44:56,600
Yeah, I just...

7057
05:44:56,600 --> 05:44:57,200
M2 isn't...

7058
05:44:57,200 --> 05:44:59,320
Yeah, the computer said M2 was the...

7059
05:44:59,320 --> 05:45:01,820
The guy trying to kill me.

7060
05:45:02,000 --> 05:45:02,860
Nothing to worry about.

7061
05:45:03,120 --> 05:45:04,080
You got this!

7062
05:45:05,280 --> 05:45:08,440
Think positive and believe in you!

7063
05:45:08,580 --> 05:45:09,800
M2 is David!

7064
05:45:10,180 --> 05:45:11,660
M1 is Fiona!

7065
05:45:15,980 --> 05:45:19,480
Clearly, you know, I know M1 is the phone guy.

7066
05:45:20,960 --> 05:45:24,040
I think M1 was actually William Afton.

7067
05:45:30,580 --> 05:45:32,080
I'm M2!

7068
05:45:41,330 --> 05:45:43,010
But who was the phone?

7069
05:45:44,030 --> 05:45:45,590
The phone was M2!

7070
05:45:47,590 --> 05:45:49,530
M1 was Markiplier!

7071
05:45:59,400 --> 05:46:02,060
Oh, I'm gonna see Edwin!

7072
05:46:02,280 --> 05:46:02,680
Edwin!

7073
05:46:03,420 --> 05:46:04,800
Oh, Edwin!

7074
05:46:07,220 --> 05:46:09,140
Your crazy robot wife!

7075
05:46:11,620 --> 05:46:12,600
What the fuck?

7076
05:46:13,240 --> 05:46:14,400
Edwin, what the fuck?

7077
05:46:14,500 --> 05:46:15,240
Why is he here?

7078
05:46:15,480 --> 05:46:16,800
How did he get here?

7079
05:46:19,300 --> 05:46:21,800
Okay, but how the fuck did he get here?

7080
05:46:24,100 --> 05:46:24,540
What the fuck did he get here?

7081
05:46:24,540 --> 05:46:24,960
Excuse me?

7082
05:46:25,160 --> 05:46:26,120
How is he here?

7083
05:46:29,260 --> 05:46:30,580
I'll put this here for now.

7084
05:46:31,120 --> 05:46:32,460
How the fuck did he get here?

7085
05:46:34,720 --> 05:46:36,460
There was one train!

7086
05:46:37,400 --> 05:46:38,380
Uh-uh, he lives here?

7087
05:46:38,660 --> 05:46:40,540
Okay, but there was one train!

7088
05:46:42,900 --> 05:46:45,340
Oh my god, please, I don't want...

7089
05:46:45,340 --> 05:46:47,360
I don't want to kick it.

7090
05:46:47,520 --> 05:46:47,760
I don't want to kick it.

7091
05:46:47,760 --> 05:46:47,780
Please!

7092
05:46:49,000 --> 05:46:50,740
I'm so tired!

7093
05:46:59,860 --> 05:47:01,600
Oh my god, I did not mean to do that.

7094
05:47:01,600 --> 05:47:03,760
I did not mean to do that.

7095
05:47:07,540 --> 05:47:08,140
Nice.

7096
05:47:10,500 --> 05:47:12,320
That was an accident.

7097
05:47:13,240 --> 05:47:15,140
All right, what is this video?

7098
05:47:15,660 --> 05:47:16,480
Hey, David!

7099
05:47:18,000 --> 05:47:19,260
Oh, it's a birthday!

7100
05:47:19,260 --> 05:47:19,820
Happy birthday, buddy.

7101
05:47:20,100 --> 05:47:21,460
Happy birthday, sweetie.

7102
05:47:22,200 --> 05:47:24,260
Mommy made this special for you.

7103
05:47:25,480 --> 05:47:26,000
Wow.

7104
05:47:26,660 --> 05:47:28,480
Fiona, he turned out great.

7105
05:47:28,620 --> 05:47:29,820
I think it's your best one yet.

7106
05:47:29,940 --> 05:47:31,020
Wait, how does he see?

7107
05:47:31,260 --> 05:47:31,900
Look at this.

7108
05:47:32,160 --> 05:47:33,020
Look, look!

7109
05:47:33,700 --> 05:47:35,220
A terrible way to live.

7110
05:47:35,880 --> 05:47:36,500
Hi there!

7111
05:47:36,960 --> 05:47:38,260
Shiver me to birds!

7112
05:47:39,940 --> 05:47:40,800
Oh, honey.

7113
05:47:41,000 --> 05:47:44,560
He got, like, both his eyes stabbed out, and then he wears two eye patches?

7114
05:47:45,020 --> 05:47:49,040
I guess he doesn't want people to see his, like, socket.

7115
05:47:49,260 --> 05:47:49,880
eye socket.

7116
05:47:53,800 --> 05:47:54,520
One.

7117
05:47:57,000 --> 05:47:58,440
Oh, it says one.

7118
05:48:00,180 --> 05:48:01,900
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

7119
05:48:03,680 --> 05:48:06,360
Oh my god, I'm not so sorry.

7120
05:48:07,560 --> 05:48:08,280
Okay.

7121
05:48:09,120 --> 05:48:09,800
One.

7122
05:48:10,740 --> 05:48:12,280
I'm supposed to find all of them.

7123
05:48:13,460 --> 05:48:14,040
Oh my god.

7124
05:48:21,440 --> 05:48:22,160
Friends!

7125
05:48:30,110 --> 05:48:32,170
Wait, what if I don't wanna...

7126
05:48:32,170 --> 05:48:32,630
Wait, what?

7127
05:48:36,710 --> 05:48:37,670
Wait, what?

7128
05:48:38,350 --> 05:48:38,970
Wait.

7129
05:48:39,390 --> 05:48:40,490
My internet's fine.

7130
05:48:42,650 --> 05:48:44,170
Oh, is it YouTube?

7131
05:48:44,170 --> 05:48:44,350
YouTube!

7132
05:48:49,110 --> 05:48:50,190
Oh my god.

7133
05:48:53,270 --> 05:48:54,470
Mind it, it's fine.

7134
05:49:02,600 --> 05:49:03,480
Wait, are we back?

7135
05:49:03,620 --> 05:49:04,940
Okay, it was YouTube, guys.

7136
05:49:05,540 --> 05:49:06,860
I was like, what?

7137
05:49:09,820 --> 05:49:11,740
It's YouTube, because I was okay.

7138
05:49:13,840 --> 05:49:15,120
I was so confused.

7139
05:49:15,120 --> 05:49:16,660
I was like, what are you talking about?

7140
05:49:16,660 --> 05:49:18,240
I'm live right now.

7141
05:49:18,380 --> 05:49:19,640
My internet didn't go down.

7142
05:49:21,720 --> 05:49:23,560
Oh my god, not surprised, please.

7143
05:49:42,210 --> 05:49:45,070
Oh my god, I couldn't get out of there.

7144
05:49:45,490 --> 05:49:46,770
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

7145
05:49:48,310 --> 05:49:49,550
Okay, that scared me.

7146
05:49:49,770 --> 05:49:50,430
That actually scared me.

7147
05:49:50,470 --> 05:49:51,330
I thought I was fucked.

7148
05:49:53,190 --> 05:49:53,810
Okay.

7149
05:49:54,390 --> 05:49:55,710
Oh, that was really close.

7150
05:49:56,030 --> 05:49:59,070
That was really, really, really close.

7151
05:50:00,670 --> 05:50:02,030
Alright, what's this?

7152
05:50:03,890 --> 05:50:07,130
Just give him the dad ticket, Doki!

7153
05:50:07,490 --> 05:50:07,990
Please!

7154
05:50:09,490 --> 05:50:11,030
Wait for Mama.

7155
05:50:11,650 --> 05:50:12,650
Mama loves present.

7156
05:50:13,730 --> 05:50:15,930
Just give him the ticket!

7157
05:50:16,350 --> 05:50:17,730
It'll all be gone!

7158
05:50:19,210 --> 05:50:20,990
Oh, I'm sorry.

7159
05:50:21,150 --> 05:50:22,230
Your mom's dead.

7160
05:50:22,230 --> 05:50:25,570
In a way, she's here.

7161
05:50:25,850 --> 05:50:26,870
She's with us.

7162
05:50:27,730 --> 05:50:31,170
Mommy will always be here, watching over us.

7163
05:50:33,330 --> 05:50:34,590
You better start opening.

7164
05:50:34,930 --> 05:50:36,010
There's a lot to open.

7165
05:50:36,730 --> 05:50:38,150
I gotta get back to work.

7166
05:50:38,910 --> 05:50:39,350
Aw.

7167
05:50:40,630 --> 05:50:45,450
Look, I know you're sad, but I'll... Retail therapy will fix you.

7168
05:50:45,450 --> 05:50:47,430
Oh, I'm such a good dad.

7169
05:50:48,810 --> 05:50:49,470
To...

7170
05:50:49,470 --> 05:50:50,910
I have to watch everything?

7171
05:51:01,220 --> 05:51:01,880
Please.

7172
05:51:02,940 --> 05:51:04,940
That's all he knows how to say!

7173
05:51:08,940 --> 05:51:10,240
God, I don't...

7174
05:51:17,120 --> 05:51:20,060
I don't want... I don't want... This is trauma!

7175
05:51:23,020 --> 05:51:24,600
Where's the mouse?

7176
05:51:34,450 --> 05:51:35,320
Hey, that's me!

7177
05:51:38,600 --> 05:51:39,540
Oh!

7178
05:51:39,820 --> 05:51:40,580
I don't know!

7179
05:51:47,590 --> 05:51:49,210
Oh my god, please!

7180
05:51:49,650 --> 05:51:50,170
Please!

7181
05:52:02,170 --> 05:52:03,230
Does that not work?

7182
05:52:03,710 --> 05:52:05,370
Look at this... Look at this rat go!

7183
05:52:05,930 --> 05:52:06,890
Look at him go!

7184
05:52:07,150 --> 05:52:07,950
Oh my god!

7185
05:52:12,820 --> 05:52:13,420
Damn!

7186
05:52:14,420 --> 05:52:15,160
Keep moving!

7187
05:52:16,540 --> 05:52:16,880
Where

7188
05:52:26,700 --> 05:52:27,820
do you want to go next?

7189
05:52:31,720 --> 05:52:32,640
Hi, that's me!

7190
05:52:33,320 --> 05:52:34,580
Oh my god!

7191
05:52:38,780 --> 05:52:40,160
Oh my god!

7192
05:52:40,340 --> 05:52:40,340
Oh my god!

7193
05:52:40,340 --> 05:52:40,780
I just...

7194
05:52:40,780 --> 05:52:43,020
I don't know why I keep pressing buttons!

7195
05:52:47,370 --> 05:52:48,980
I don't know why!

7196
05:52:50,560 --> 05:52:52,560
I can't help it!

7197
05:52:55,690 --> 05:52:56,890
I see...

7198
05:52:56,890 --> 05:52:58,230
I see button!

7199
05:52:58,410 --> 05:52:59,970
I wanna press it so bad!

7200
05:53:13,090 --> 05:53:14,180
No, he didn't.

7201
05:53:18,770 --> 05:53:19,810
No, he didn't!

7202
05:53:24,020 --> 05:53:25,140
Kick it, please!

7203
05:53:27,020 --> 05:53:28,240
Kick it, please!

7204
05:53:29,400 --> 05:53:30,720
This is more important!

7205
05:53:32,200 --> 05:53:33,240
Oh my god!

7206
05:53:35,420 --> 05:53:36,920
Okay, this goes down...

7207
05:53:36,920 --> 05:53:37,540
Oh, thank god!

7208
05:53:37,700 --> 05:53:38,300
This goes downstairs!

7209
05:53:48,840 --> 05:53:49,440
Okay!

7210
05:53:49,800 --> 05:53:51,100
We got another tape!

7211
05:53:52,160 --> 05:53:53,180
Oh my god!

7212
05:53:53,900 --> 05:53:55,220
Into the vault you go!

7213
05:53:55,220 --> 05:53:55,300
Oh!

7214
05:53:59,030 --> 05:53:59,670
Alright!

7215
05:54:02,350 --> 05:54:04,290
Alright, what's your next trauma?

7216
05:54:04,630 --> 05:54:06,230
Oh, there's Freddy Pizzeria!

7217
05:54:07,270 --> 05:54:08,410
This is great!

7218
05:54:08,610 --> 05:54:09,410
He's gonna love it!

7219
05:54:10,590 --> 05:54:11,490
What does that say?

7220
05:54:11,850 --> 05:54:12,810
Did you make this?

7221
05:54:13,950 --> 05:54:15,570
I baked it myself!

7222
05:54:15,970 --> 05:54:17,250
Oh, there she is!

7223
05:54:17,250 --> 05:54:18,850
That's not...

7224
05:54:18,850 --> 05:54:19,870
That's...

7225
05:54:19,870 --> 05:54:22,910
That's not creepy at all!

7226
05:54:23,310 --> 05:54:24,210
I think we're ready!

7227
05:54:25,010 --> 05:54:25,490
Oh...

7228
05:54:25,490 --> 05:54:25,510
That's...

7229
05:54:27,030 --> 05:54:27,990
That's...

7230
05:54:27,990 --> 05:54:28,010
That's...

7231
05:54:28,010 --> 05:54:28,510
Okay...

7232
05:54:31,070 --> 05:54:31,550
That's...

7233
05:54:32,090 --> 05:54:32,570
Okay...

7234
05:54:35,930 --> 05:54:36,890
That's...

7235
05:54:36,890 --> 05:54:37,370
Okay...

7236
05:54:38,030 --> 05:54:39,630
Do you think he like...

7237
05:54:39,850 --> 05:54:41,790
Okay, one, two, seven...

7238
05:54:41,790 --> 05:54:42,650
Okay, do you...

7239
05:54:43,470 --> 05:54:43,870
You...

7240
05:54:44,650 --> 05:54:45,850
You think...

7241
05:54:46,350 --> 05:54:46,710
You think...

7242
05:54:50,390 --> 05:54:51,190
Yes!

7243
05:54:52,130 --> 05:55:00,150
I think it's...

7244
05:55:00,150 --> 05:55:00,550
Canon!

7245
05:55:07,750 --> 05:55:08,950
Okay, don't...

7246
05:55:09,350 --> 05:55:10,030
Alright!

7247
05:55:10,350 --> 05:55:12,050
How many more tapes do I have left?

7248
05:55:13,110 --> 05:55:15,070
I won't finish the...

7249
05:55:15,070 --> 05:55:16,190
I won't finish the...

7250
05:55:16,190 --> 05:55:16,930
I won't finish my statement...

7251
05:55:16,930 --> 05:55:18,470
But do you think...

7252
05:55:18,470 --> 05:55:19,050
You know...

7253
05:55:24,410 --> 05:55:26,250
Okay, where's the...

7254
05:55:26,250 --> 05:55:26,690
Last two?

7255
05:55:26,970 --> 05:55:27,650
There's two more?

7256
05:55:27,910 --> 05:55:30,270
I assume one is at the top...

7257
05:55:30,270 --> 05:55:31,390
Of the building...

7258
05:55:31,390 --> 05:55:33,050
On the second floor...

7259
05:55:35,090 --> 05:55:36,550
Are they both...

7260
05:55:36,550 --> 05:55:37,390
Are they both...

7261
05:55:37,390 --> 05:55:37,730
Are they both...

7262
05:55:37,730 --> 05:55:38,290
Of...

7263
05:55:38,290 --> 05:55:38,550
Uh...

7264
05:55:38,550 --> 05:55:39,070
Second floor?

7265
05:55:41,760 --> 05:55:42,870
Okay, but like...

7266
05:55:42,870 --> 05:55:43,570
Look at her!

7267
05:55:44,760 --> 05:55:45,970
What about it?

7268
05:55:46,250 --> 05:55:47,110
Just me and...

7269
05:55:47,110 --> 05:55:48,190
Edwin go...

7270
05:55:48,190 --> 05:55:48,830
Yeah...

7271
05:55:52,710 --> 05:55:53,850
I'm just...

7272
05:55:53,850 --> 05:55:55,530
I'm just saying...

7273
05:55:57,050 --> 05:55:58,290
You know...

7274
05:55:58,290 --> 05:55:59,990
Even though I like robots...

7275
05:55:59,990 --> 05:56:00,890
I think some kind of...

7276
05:56:00,890 --> 05:56:02,090
Some robots are pretty hot...

7277
05:56:02,670 --> 05:56:03,210
Like...

7278
05:56:03,210 --> 05:56:03,650
There...

7279
05:56:03,650 --> 05:56:04,230
Like...

7280
05:56:04,230 --> 05:56:06,010
There is justification for that...

7281
05:56:06,010 --> 05:56:06,970
But you look at her!

7282
05:56:07,670 --> 05:56:08,230
What?

7283
05:56:08,390 --> 05:56:09,390
Is it the eyes?

7284
05:56:11,610 --> 05:56:12,170
Like...

7285
05:56:13,190 --> 05:56:14,990
Maybe it's the eyes...

7286
05:56:16,030 --> 05:56:17,470
Could be the eyes...

7287
05:56:17,470 --> 05:56:18,990
Just look at the eyes...

7288
05:56:20,930 --> 05:56:23,090
Yeah, you don't see that vision...

7289
05:56:25,370 --> 05:56:25,810
Shhh...

7290
05:56:25,810 --> 05:56:27,090
She's a beautiful...

7291
05:56:32,640 --> 05:56:33,740
I just need...

7292
05:56:33,740 --> 05:56:35,180
Him to go over here...

7293
05:56:35,760 --> 05:56:39,240
And you wouldn't get it...

7294
05:56:47,910 --> 05:56:49,210
God, I heard him...

7295
05:56:49,210 --> 05:56:50,630
He was like right next to me...

7296
05:56:50,630 --> 05:56:51,010
And I got...

7297
05:56:51,010 --> 05:56:51,970
Yeah, he was right there...

7298
05:56:54,130 --> 05:56:55,690
How the fuck did he hear me?

7299
05:57:02,240 --> 05:57:05,500
I don't know how the fuck this guy heard me though...

7300
05:57:07,780 --> 05:57:09,500
Oh my god, he's camping me...

7301
05:57:11,700 --> 05:57:12,100
Oh...

7302
05:57:12,100 --> 05:57:13,520
One is second floor...

7303
05:57:13,520 --> 05:57:14,700
The other one is downstairs...

7304
05:57:14,700 --> 05:57:15,400
Okay, I'll get the...

7305
05:57:15,400 --> 05:57:16,500
Second floor one first...

7306
05:57:28,260 --> 05:57:30,320
Cause I think the second floor is safer...

7307
05:57:36,520 --> 05:57:37,500
Can I get in here?

7308
05:57:37,600 --> 05:57:39,220
No, I can't...

7309
05:57:39,220 --> 05:57:41,240
I didn't know...

7310
05:57:43,120 --> 05:57:44,900
I don't think he heard that...

7311
05:57:44,900 --> 05:57:45,920
Not yet...

7312
05:57:49,780 --> 05:57:50,820
Is there like...

7313
05:57:50,820 --> 05:57:52,240
A way to get downstairs...

7314
05:57:52,240 --> 05:57:52,560
Easily?

7315
05:57:58,180 --> 05:57:59,440
I'll bait him here?

7316
05:57:59,880 --> 05:58:01,360
So then I could do this...

7317
05:58:04,620 --> 05:58:08,040
Oh my god...

7318
05:58:15,550 --> 05:58:17,650
Oh ho ho ho...

7319
05:58:23,950 --> 05:58:24,510
Nice...

7320
05:58:27,090 --> 05:58:28,570
Oh, that was scary...

7321
05:58:28,570 --> 05:58:29,150
Oh, okay...

7322
05:58:29,150 --> 05:58:29,970
That was scary...

7323
05:58:29,970 --> 05:58:30,790
Oh...

7324
05:58:30,790 --> 05:58:32,370
There you go...

7325
05:58:32,370 --> 05:58:33,310
Last one's downstairs...

7326
05:58:36,470 --> 05:58:37,430
Keep looking...

7327
05:58:37,430 --> 05:58:38,630
It's around here somewhere...

7328
05:58:38,630 --> 05:58:39,430
Where is it?

7329
05:58:39,770 --> 05:58:40,250
Oh...

7330
05:58:40,250 --> 05:58:41,310
You're cold...

7331
05:58:47,510 --> 05:58:47,990
Wow...

7332
05:58:47,990 --> 05:58:48,110
Wow...

7333
05:58:48,110 --> 05:58:49,970
Three tail therapy...

7334
05:58:49,970 --> 05:58:51,030
Can't be depressing...

7335
05:58:51,030 --> 05:58:53,030
I keep buying my son things...

7336
05:58:53,810 --> 05:58:54,770
Let's go...

7337
05:58:54,770 --> 05:58:56,330
You want a car too, son?

7338
05:58:56,710 --> 05:58:57,650
Of course...

7339
05:59:03,310 --> 05:59:04,150
What's going on?

7340
05:59:04,250 --> 05:59:04,450
Okay...

7341
05:59:04,450 --> 05:59:06,090
One, two, seven, four...

7342
05:59:12,870 --> 05:59:13,970
Oh, I hear him...

7343
05:59:13,970 --> 05:59:14,710
He's like right here...

7344
05:59:18,610 --> 05:59:19,810
Oh, I hear him...

7345
05:59:20,650 --> 05:59:23,950
One, two, seven, four...

7346
05:59:25,250 --> 05:59:27,190
Stop, I'm sorry!

7347
05:59:29,070 --> 05:59:31,430
I'll buy a ticket next time!

7348
05:59:39,550 --> 05:59:43,490
I forgot where to go...

7349
05:59:44,990 --> 05:59:45,470
Surprise!

7350
05:59:48,110 --> 05:59:50,810
Assume the last one is like on the other...

7351
05:59:59,520 --> 06:00:01,000
Wait, where's the last one?

7352
06:00:02,060 --> 06:00:03,160
It's not here?

7353
06:00:04,060 --> 06:00:06,420
Where the fuck is the last tape?!

7354
06:00:08,080 --> 06:00:11,300
Okay, maybe this vent will take me to the last tape.

7355
06:00:15,200 --> 06:00:16,320
Oh my god, it did.

7356
06:00:16,380 --> 06:00:16,880
I knew it.

7357
06:00:18,640 --> 06:00:19,920
I knew I'm so smart.

7358
06:00:19,920 --> 06:00:22,500
Oh my god, and it's pink.

7359
06:00:25,560 --> 06:00:25,980
Okay.

7360
06:00:28,080 --> 06:00:30,440
And then after that, we get the password.

7361
06:00:37,140 --> 06:00:40,520
Oh please, I don't want surprises anymore.

7362
06:00:41,040 --> 06:00:43,800
I'm so tired of surprises.

7363
06:00:53,620 --> 06:00:54,460
Please.

7364
06:00:58,300 --> 06:01:00,740
I'm so tired of surprises.

7365
06:01:04,620 --> 06:01:05,460
Oh

7366
06:01:13,450 --> 06:01:14,270
my god, please.

7367
06:01:14,610 --> 06:01:15,330
Please.

7368
06:01:16,510 --> 06:01:18,490
Leave me alone!

7369
06:01:28,020 --> 06:01:29,560
Oh my god, this is okay.

7370
06:01:29,920 --> 06:01:30,540
Here we go.

7371
06:01:31,040 --> 06:01:31,520
Oh!

7372
06:01:35,380 --> 06:01:36,420
Oh my god.

7373
06:01:36,780 --> 06:01:37,720
Put that in here.

7374
06:01:40,260 --> 06:01:41,340
Get in here.

7375
06:01:41,380 --> 06:01:42,220
I'm fucking tired of this.

7376
06:01:42,400 --> 06:01:42,460
Okay.

7377
06:01:43,640 --> 06:01:44,080
Oh my god.

7378
06:01:44,280 --> 06:01:45,080
Okay, and then...

7379
06:01:46,860 --> 06:01:47,560
There we go.

7380
06:01:48,020 --> 06:01:48,560
Last floor.

7381
06:01:50,960 --> 06:01:52,040
I'm so tired.

7382
06:01:52,360 --> 06:01:53,420
I'm so tired.

7383
06:01:53,440 --> 06:01:53,860
I'm so tired of this.

7384
06:01:58,660 --> 06:01:59,140
The...

7385
06:02:02,220 --> 06:02:03,500
I'm so tired of that.

7386
06:02:04,060 --> 06:02:04,180
I could go into our lives.

7387
06:02:04,180 --> 06:02:06,200
Just give me a minute.

7388
06:02:06,860 --> 06:02:07,820
I had the best idea.

7389
06:02:08,680 --> 06:02:09,160
Okay.

7390
06:02:10,020 --> 06:02:10,500
Well...

7391
06:02:10,500 --> 06:02:11,160
This is the one.

7392
06:02:11,760 --> 06:02:13,220
Bigger than the clean ovac.

7393
06:02:13,440 --> 06:02:14,580
That's great honey.

7394
06:02:14,800 --> 06:02:16,640
But you're missing the party.

7395
06:02:26,660 --> 06:02:27,560
Awww.

7396
06:02:27,560 --> 06:02:29,560
And then she dies.

7397
06:02:31,460 --> 06:02:32,360
Awww.

7398
06:02:32,360 --> 06:02:34,720
She never got... Awww.

7399
06:02:35,120 --> 06:02:37,620
He missed the birthday with Fionna.

7400
06:02:40,000 --> 06:02:41,880
And she was alive.

7401
06:02:42,540 --> 06:02:42,900
Awww.

7402
06:02:43,100 --> 06:02:43,960
That's so sad.

7403
06:02:44,820 --> 06:02:45,700
I think it's peace.

7404
06:02:46,080 --> 06:02:46,220
Okay.

7405
06:02:47,100 --> 06:02:47,940
What's the number?

7406
06:02:49,960 --> 06:02:51,520
And then... Awww.

7407
06:02:54,080 --> 06:02:55,640
1, 2, 7, 4, 6.

7408
06:02:55,860 --> 06:02:56,060
Okay.

7409
06:02:56,440 --> 06:02:58,200
He has a bad husband and a father.

7410
06:02:58,320 --> 06:02:59,340
I think we all agree with that.

7411
06:02:59,820 --> 06:03:04,020
I mean, he literally built... He rebuilt his mom.

7412
06:03:04,140 --> 06:03:06,800
I don't think his son ever like...

7413
06:03:06,800 --> 06:03:10,800
That is not a good way to heal from trauma.

7414
06:03:11,120 --> 06:03:12,580
That's what I'll say.

7415
06:03:13,820 --> 06:03:21,040
When your dad builds a fucking robot mom... I don't think that's gonna help with curing trauma.

7416
06:03:22,800 --> 06:03:23,840
Guys, what's the number?

7417
06:03:25,020 --> 06:03:26,480
1, 6, 2, 4, 7.

7418
06:03:26,660 --> 06:03:26,820
Okay.

7419
06:03:29,180 --> 06:03:35,240
1, 6, 2, 4... Like, he has no time to heal from that trauma.

7420
06:03:40,300 --> 06:03:42,920
Oh yeah, there's a miniature building.

7421
06:03:43,360 --> 06:03:44,100
Oh!

7422
06:03:45,380 --> 06:03:47,220
Murray's Costume Mania.

7423
06:03:47,820 --> 06:03:49,340
That sounds fun.

7424
06:03:50,320 --> 06:03:51,240
I got mail.

7425
06:03:53,970 --> 06:03:55,580
Alright, one final mail.

7426
06:03:56,680 --> 06:03:59,440
What do you mean I can't just replace your mom with a robot?

7427
06:04:00,940 --> 06:04:03,080
The Umbrella Academy did it.

7428
06:04:04,200 --> 06:04:06,520
And those kids turned out fine.

7429
06:04:07,960 --> 06:04:08,360
Home.

7430
06:04:08,760 --> 06:04:09,600
My home.

7431
06:04:11,780 --> 06:04:15,920
I feel the new spring locks are working well, even with the water damage.

7432
06:04:16,380 --> 06:04:18,360
They should be ready for the diner soon.

7433
06:04:18,360 --> 06:04:22,640
Just make sure to warn N about some of the more odd behaviors they might have.

7434
06:04:23,440 --> 06:04:28,440
And when I am sending a technician, he has your M2 blueprints as well as executive access.

7435
06:04:28,820 --> 06:04:33,200
While the M2 began as a copy of my program, I believe it can become something more.

7436
06:04:33,420 --> 06:04:34,440
It wasn't me.

7437
06:04:34,780 --> 06:04:35,680
It was different.

7438
06:04:36,160 --> 06:04:38,180
Someone has been damaged and is malfunctioning.

7439
06:04:38,940 --> 06:04:41,120
M2 can no longer be controlled.

7440
06:04:41,460 --> 06:04:43,120
It will no longer listen.

7441
06:04:44,380 --> 06:04:45,860
It mimics rage.

7442
06:04:46,260 --> 06:04:47,940
It has done many bad things.

7443
06:04:48,260 --> 06:04:50,300
No one who enters the MCM is safe.

7444
06:04:50,560 --> 06:04:51,680
Please reconsider.

7445
06:04:52,200 --> 06:04:53,360
Finish the program.

7446
06:04:54,460 --> 06:04:55,060
Alright.

7447
06:04:58,810 --> 06:04:59,570
Alright.

7448
06:05:00,030 --> 06:05:01,990
Alright, Edwin, fix this.

7449
06:05:03,830 --> 06:05:04,590
Edwin?

7450
06:05:07,570 --> 06:05:10,610
Test, test, journal entry.

7451
06:05:11,490 --> 06:05:14,130
Too bad the new power test was a failure.

7452
06:05:14,990 --> 06:05:17,630
Due to a minor detonation.

7453
06:05:17,890 --> 06:05:22,050
There is damage to my office interior as well as a small fire.

7454
06:05:23,030 --> 06:05:27,090
Note to self, portable cleaner that gets rid of smoke damage.

7455
06:05:27,910 --> 06:05:30,610
Better yet, a clean-ovac attachment.

7456
06:05:32,430 --> 06:05:36,090
Wait, Edwin, what is- M2!

7457
06:05:36,910 --> 06:05:37,510
Respond!

7458
06:05:38,170 --> 06:05:38,770
Emergency!

7459
06:05:39,730 --> 06:05:40,430
Comfort help!

7460
06:05:41,870 --> 06:05:42,990
Daddy's busy, buddy.

7461
06:05:43,170 --> 06:05:44,410
Why don't you go outside and play?

7462
06:05:46,130 --> 06:05:48,910
Oh, M2 started mimicking Edwin!

7463
06:05:49,350 --> 06:05:49,670
Please!

7464
06:05:51,350 --> 06:05:52,970
He thinks he is Edwin!

7465
06:05:53,410 --> 06:05:54,070
My legs?

7466
06:05:56,070 --> 06:05:58,530
You know, speaking of legs, what do you think?

7467
06:05:58,710 --> 06:05:59,910
I just finished mine.

7468
06:06:00,610 --> 06:06:02,890
There are still a few kinks to work out.

7469
06:06:06,450 --> 06:06:07,990
That's why he's angry!

7470
06:06:10,130 --> 06:06:12,870
Oh my god, he has- I'm sorry to speak to you!

7471
06:06:12,930 --> 06:06:15,390
God, name one strugg- name- pick a struggle!

7472
06:06:16,110 --> 06:06:17,390
Oh my god, Edwin!

7473
06:06:17,650 --> 06:06:18,410
And two!

7474
06:06:19,510 --> 06:06:19,990
Respond!

7475
06:06:21,590 --> 06:06:23,730
Oh, I can't right now, buddy.

7476
06:06:23,990 --> 06:06:25,150
We can do something fun.

7477
06:06:25,270 --> 06:06:27,090
Oh, that's so sad.

7478
06:06:27,630 --> 06:06:29,010
Ask your mom if she's not busy.

7479
06:06:29,010 --> 06:06:30,130
Awww.

7480
06:06:30,610 --> 06:06:31,190
M2!

7481
06:06:31,790 --> 06:06:32,250
Help!

7482
06:06:43,350 --> 06:06:44,270
Awww.

7483
06:06:45,430 --> 06:06:46,930
Where's Edwin's dead body?

7484
06:06:49,450 --> 06:06:51,090
Like father, like son.

7485
06:06:55,320 --> 06:06:56,800
I don't want access.

7486
06:06:56,800 --> 06:06:56,880
I don't want access.

7487
06:07:02,480 --> 06:07:04,900
So is M2 banging M?

7488
06:07:05,120 --> 06:07:05,900
Oh, wait.

7489
06:07:06,060 --> 06:07:07,240
That's a little fucked up.

7490
06:07:09,320 --> 06:07:10,840
There's a surveillance room.

7491
06:07:11,500 --> 06:07:12,340
Wait a minute.

7492
06:07:13,780 --> 06:07:17,520
If M2 thinks- If M2 thinks he's- He's Edwin.

7493
06:07:20,120 --> 06:07:21,280
Wait a minute.

7494
06:07:22,200 --> 06:07:22,800
Oh, file.

7495
06:07:23,140 --> 06:07:23,740
Redacted.

7496
06:07:25,680 --> 06:07:26,280
Yes.

7497
06:07:26,860 --> 06:07:28,040
I know what you are.

7498
06:07:28,080 --> 06:07:29,060
I don't trust you.

7499
06:07:29,420 --> 06:07:30,660
I know what you are.

7500
06:07:31,000 --> 06:07:32,880
You fucking softlocked me.

7501
06:07:43,920 --> 06:07:44,520
Wait.

7502
06:07:45,100 --> 06:07:45,340
No.

7503
06:07:46,420 --> 06:07:48,260
Okay, I'll do one last pet.

7504
06:07:48,260 --> 06:07:49,080
I swear to God.

7505
06:07:49,220 --> 06:07:50,460
If he fucking softlocked me.

7506
06:07:50,460 --> 06:07:51,300
I swear to God.

7507
06:07:51,500 --> 06:07:53,160
If he softlocked me.

7508
06:07:54,020 --> 06:07:54,240
Hello.

7509
06:07:54,520 --> 06:07:54,920
Good boy.

7510
06:07:55,580 --> 06:07:55,860
Alright.

7511
06:07:57,020 --> 06:07:57,820
That's enough.

7512
06:07:59,460 --> 06:08:01,520
What if the cleaner is Edwin?

7513
06:08:01,720 --> 06:08:03,520
Then he doesn't deserve pets!

7514
06:08:05,300 --> 06:08:08,520
And he's the last bot to deserve a pet!

7515
06:08:10,800 --> 06:08:11,560
Oh!

7516
06:08:18,320 --> 06:08:21,200
I did- I was like- Wait.

7517
06:08:22,820 --> 06:08:25,820
Okay, oops.

7518
06:08:26,380 --> 06:08:26,700
Okay.

7519
06:08:27,120 --> 06:08:27,540
Sorry.

7520
06:08:27,840 --> 06:08:30,340
I only pulled it halfway.

7521
06:08:30,720 --> 06:08:32,640
I didn't finish the job.

7522
06:08:33,080 --> 06:08:33,440
Okay.

7523
06:08:33,900 --> 06:08:34,180
Okay.

7524
06:08:34,620 --> 06:08:35,240
Now.

7525
06:08:36,860 --> 06:08:39,340
I didn't finish the job.

7526
06:08:39,540 --> 06:08:40,700
Holy shit.

7527
06:08:41,240 --> 06:08:41,560
Okay.

7528
06:08:42,020 --> 06:08:42,220
Here.

7529
06:08:42,340 --> 06:08:42,720
I'll go.

7530
06:08:43,420 --> 06:08:43,840
Oh no.

7531
06:08:44,460 --> 06:08:46,640
I got- Creep that soldier bot!

7532
06:08:48,980 --> 06:08:49,680
Oh no.

7533
06:08:49,860 --> 06:08:50,560
Please stop.

7534
06:08:52,420 --> 06:08:54,980
I'm so tired of tickets.

7535
06:08:55,840 --> 06:08:56,600
I'm- Please!

7536
06:08:56,820 --> 06:08:57,660
I'm sorry!

7537
06:08:59,750 --> 06:09:01,950
I'll buy a ticket next time!

7538
06:09:05,370 --> 06:09:06,330
It's me.

7539
06:09:06,330 --> 06:09:10,390
It's been a long time since we had a chance to talk.

7540
06:09:10,950 --> 06:09:13,330
I hope you're taking care of yourself.

7541
06:09:14,010 --> 06:09:15,050
Knowing you.

7542
06:09:15,390 --> 06:09:17,930
You are still trying to hold it all together.

7543
06:09:19,110 --> 06:09:19,790
But...

7544
06:09:20,330 --> 06:09:22,470
The company doesn't matter anymore.

7545
06:09:22,470 --> 06:09:23,310
Oh my god.

7546
06:09:23,490 --> 06:09:24,410
What the fuck?

7547
06:09:25,130 --> 06:09:26,310
Like, please!

7548
06:09:26,630 --> 06:09:27,510
Save us!

7549
06:09:27,910 --> 06:09:29,050
I beg you.

7550
06:09:29,690 --> 06:09:31,090
Put it all aside.

7551
06:09:31,330 --> 06:09:32,730
And fix M2.

7552
06:09:33,910 --> 06:09:35,630
It is not too late.

7553
06:09:36,830 --> 06:09:40,130
You can stay up in the main house if you want to.

7554
06:09:40,870 --> 06:09:44,110
But would you consider visiting every once in a while?

7555
06:09:44,110 --> 06:09:44,130
Well...

7556
06:09:45,110 --> 06:09:46,150
I miss you.

7557
06:09:46,450 --> 06:09:48,330
You're the rainbow cat.

7558
06:09:48,690 --> 06:09:49,670
I miss my child.

7559
06:09:51,190 --> 06:09:52,950
I've watched him grow up.

7560
06:09:53,190 --> 06:09:54,590
Through this machine.

7561
06:09:55,730 --> 06:09:56,950
I want him back.

7562
06:09:57,870 --> 06:09:59,350
It's not too late.

7563
06:09:59,710 --> 06:10:00,910
To fix our family.

7564
06:10:03,530 --> 06:10:04,250
Entering.

7565
06:10:04,510 --> 06:10:05,230
Standlight.

7566
06:10:06,010 --> 06:10:06,690
Oh.

7567
06:10:20,010 --> 06:10:20,950
I don't know.

7568
06:10:21,110 --> 06:10:22,030
I thought he would hate.

7569
06:10:22,470 --> 06:10:23,770
I thought he in the...

7570
06:10:23,770 --> 06:10:28,390
In the bubble hat would reconcile and be like, you're right.

7571
06:10:28,710 --> 06:10:29,910
You're so right.

7572
06:10:30,250 --> 06:10:30,510
God.

7573
06:10:30,950 --> 06:10:31,770
I don't know.

7574
06:10:31,990 --> 06:10:33,990
I thought he'd be like, you're so right.

7575
06:10:34,750 --> 06:10:35,950
Are you so...

7576
06:10:35,950 --> 06:10:36,350
Please.

7577
06:10:38,260 --> 06:10:38,550
Please.

7578
06:10:38,870 --> 06:10:39,730
Let me go.

7579
06:10:40,030 --> 06:10:40,830
Let me go.

7580
06:10:41,190 --> 06:10:42,250
Oh my god, please.

7581
06:10:43,690 --> 06:10:44,070
Please.

7582
06:10:44,250 --> 06:10:45,010
No, you didn't!

7583
06:10:45,010 --> 06:10:46,430
No, you didn't!

7584
06:10:46,590 --> 06:10:50,310
Oh my god, just let me literally walk over here!

7585
06:10:52,790 --> 06:10:56,150
Oh no, I thought what she said was inspiring!

7586
06:10:59,030 --> 06:11:01,230
I thought she felt inspired!

7587
06:11:01,770 --> 06:11:04,310
Oh my god, I don't know where he came from.

7588
06:11:07,550 --> 06:11:09,490
But that's also Edwin!

7589
06:11:13,210 --> 06:11:16,670
Oh my god, I found you!

7590
06:11:20,670 --> 06:11:24,630
Please, please, please, please, please!

7591
06:11:25,130 --> 06:11:27,270
I'm running as fast as I could!

7592
06:11:27,450 --> 06:11:31,990
It feels so slow, but I swear to god, this is fast mode!

7593
06:11:35,050 --> 06:11:37,730
Please, please, please!

7594
06:11:39,490 --> 06:11:41,010
Where does the lever go?

7595
06:11:45,160 --> 06:11:46,780
That's where the lever went!

7596
06:11:52,280 --> 06:11:54,160
Oh, I'm running!

7597
06:11:54,340 --> 06:11:55,040
I'm running!

7598
06:11:55,380 --> 06:11:56,080
I'm running!

7599
06:11:56,420 --> 06:11:57,640
Where is the lever?

7600
06:11:58,980 --> 06:12:00,440
Oh my god, that's...

7601
06:12:02,180 --> 06:12:05,240
Oh my god, I didn't know where the lever was because I never looked!

7602
06:12:05,240 --> 06:12:06,340
Oh my god.

7603
06:12:07,520 --> 06:12:08,420
This is 5!

7604
06:12:10,480 --> 06:12:11,460
This is 5!

7605
06:12:13,720 --> 06:12:14,740
This is 5!

7606
06:12:17,440 --> 06:12:18,440
Oh my god!

7607
06:12:24,910 --> 06:12:27,450
This is not worth $25.

7608
06:12:28,490 --> 06:12:30,210
This is not worth...

7609
06:12:32,930 --> 06:12:33,850
Oh my god.

7610
06:12:34,030 --> 06:12:35,590
Oh my god, I'm planning on...

7611
06:12:35,590 --> 06:12:38,290
I don't know which way was the right way, I don't remember.

7612
06:12:38,790 --> 06:12:39,210
I don't...

7613
06:12:42,830 --> 06:12:47,810
I have so much fear that I don't remember how to run.

7614
06:12:50,010 --> 06:12:51,570
Okay, here we go.

7615
06:12:52,470 --> 06:12:55,690
I better get at least six pizzas after this.

7616
06:12:55,870 --> 06:12:58,850
Oh my god, I actually don't remember which way it is.

7617
06:12:59,710 --> 06:13:00,590
I think it's here.

7618
06:13:00,710 --> 06:13:01,870
Okay, I remember this way.

7619
06:13:02,230 --> 06:13:04,530
And then now I actually don't remember.

7620
06:13:08,150 --> 06:13:09,170
Oh my god, it's this way.

7621
06:13:09,390 --> 06:13:11,270
Oh my god, they're all falling.

7622
06:13:11,670 --> 06:13:13,250
Where did they all come from?

7623
06:13:13,450 --> 06:13:16,010
Where did all these mini guys come from?

7624
06:13:18,730 --> 06:13:20,950
Where did Edwin make more babies?

7625
06:13:28,720 --> 06:13:36,400
Oh my god, I'm saved.

7626
06:13:36,700 --> 06:13:38,680
Oh my god, they look like little spiders.

7627
06:13:39,000 --> 06:13:41,100
They have been very dizzy.

7628
06:13:41,660 --> 06:13:43,260
It's like... what the fuck?

7629
06:13:43,980 --> 06:13:44,960
Where did these be?

7630
06:13:45,120 --> 06:13:46,620
Oh my god!

7631
06:13:47,060 --> 06:13:47,740
Like...

7632
06:13:47,740 --> 06:13:50,100
Look at these guys skirting after me!

7633
06:13:50,300 --> 06:13:51,120
What the fuck?

7634
06:13:52,820 --> 06:13:54,220
Go!

7635
06:13:54,460 --> 06:13:54,760
Go!

7636
06:13:57,040 --> 06:13:57,780
Go!

7637
06:13:59,460 --> 06:14:00,220
Bye!

7638
06:14:06,060 --> 06:14:10,520
Oh yeah, it's so exciting!

7639
06:14:10,520 --> 06:14:14,320
The family fun centers, even more spectacular than they already are!

7640
06:14:14,720 --> 06:14:18,280
We appreciate your business, and we'll always be here for you!

7641
06:14:18,380 --> 06:14:18,740
Hey!

7642
06:14:19,840 --> 06:14:20,960
Check back often!

7643
06:14:21,540 --> 06:14:25,980
Our technological wizards never stop dreaming up new costumes, games, and experiences.

7644
06:14:26,000 --> 06:14:27,200
Had a great time!

7645
06:14:34,400 --> 06:14:35,920
That looks so fun.

7646
06:14:37,280 --> 06:14:38,620
Welcome to hell.

7647
06:14:40,020 --> 06:14:40,920
Wait, what?

7648
06:14:42,640 --> 06:14:44,760
Is that the exit?

7649
06:14:47,700 --> 06:14:50,560
Guys, I swear to god, it was like this when I got here.

7650
06:14:54,300 --> 06:14:55,800
Guys, I swear to god.

7651
06:14:58,660 --> 06:15:01,120
I... it was like this when I got here, guys.

7652
06:15:01,380 --> 06:15:03,980
I... I swear to god, I know what the fuck happened.

7653
06:15:09,860 --> 06:15:12,140
What the fuck?!

7654
06:15:12,140 --> 06:15:13,540
Holy shit!

7655
06:15:14,280 --> 06:15:15,220
Oh my god, no!

7656
06:15:54,330 --> 06:15:55,950
Wait, that's all he wanted?

7657
06:15:56,610 --> 06:15:57,930
Wait, what the fuck?

7658
06:15:59,390 --> 06:16:01,350
No one will believe you.

7659
06:16:05,750 --> 06:16:06,630
Tickets, please.

7660
06:16:08,990 --> 06:16:11,490
Bro, you could have just asked.

7661
06:16:12,410 --> 06:16:14,310
He got his ticket.

7662
06:16:22,620 --> 06:16:25,100
He got his ticket.

7663
06:16:38,640 --> 06:16:42,240
I have no pizza and my car is destroyed.

7664
06:16:50,530 --> 06:16:53,370
Oh man, that was fucking wild.

7665
06:16:53,930 --> 06:16:54,870
Holy shit.

7666
06:16:56,050 --> 06:16:58,110
That's... that was actually wild.

7667
06:16:58,270 --> 06:16:59,070
That was a wild game.

7668
06:16:59,230 --> 06:17:00,150
I'm so confused.

7669
06:17:00,430 --> 06:17:06,490
There's like... there were like moments where I'm like confused because I'm like, where does the Mimic come into play in the whole FNAF lore though?

7670
06:17:06,490 --> 06:17:11,170
Like, I guess like... we like forget the Mimic ever existed and...

7671
06:17:12,150 --> 06:17:14,350
and like just be like, okay, but...

7672
06:17:14,350 --> 06:17:15,710
Edwin built the pizzeria.

7673
06:17:18,830 --> 06:17:20,130
Oh, he did it.

7674
06:17:20,530 --> 06:17:22,210
Insurance won't believe my...

7675
06:17:22,210 --> 06:17:23,530
Like, fuck, you're right.

7676
06:17:23,850 --> 06:17:25,370
Bro, what am I gonna sell insurance?

7677
06:17:26,310 --> 06:17:27,930
I'm gonna get my car replaced!

7678
06:17:28,410 --> 06:17:28,730
I'm gonna get my car replaced!

7679
06:17:28,730 --> 06:17:33,010
I'll be like, yeah, a fucking crazy robot from that Mer... like, Edwin factory...

7680
06:17:33,010 --> 06:17:34,950
like, that Murray factory place...

7681
06:17:34,950 --> 06:17:39,030
that came over, flipped my car, and then, like, took his ticket.

7682
06:17:39,450 --> 06:17:42,870
And... yeah, and then... what... what the fuck am I... what the fuck are they gonna do?

7683
06:17:42,870 --> 06:17:44,830
I don't think I'm gonna replace my car.

7684
06:17:54,200 --> 06:17:54,960
The Mimic?

7685
06:17:55,060 --> 06:17:57,840
Oh wait, the Mimic is in the Security Breach DLC?

7686
06:17:58,220 --> 06:17:58,980
Oh, okay.

7687
06:17:59,320 --> 06:18:01,380
I think that was what confused me because like...

7688
06:18:01,380 --> 06:18:05,820
I was like, okay, but where does the Mimic come into play when it comes to the lore?

7689
06:18:06,100 --> 06:18:08,180
It's uh...

7690
06:18:08,180 --> 06:18:09,340
That's not covering my...

7691
06:18:09,340 --> 06:18:10,540
God, I knew I should have got...

7692
06:18:10,540 --> 06:18:13,580
I knew I should have got Sentient Robot Destroys My Car...

7693
06:18:13,580 --> 06:18:15,680
I knew I should have got the Terminator...

7694
06:18:15,680 --> 06:18:16,880
insurance, guys.

7695
06:18:17,740 --> 06:18:19,700
Where Sentient Robot Destroys My Car.

7696
06:18:22,640 --> 06:18:24,180
Oh, is credits a little loud?

7697
06:18:24,500 --> 06:18:25,160
Alright, don't worry.

7698
06:18:29,680 --> 06:18:30,980
Oh, but that was fun!

7699
06:18:31,660 --> 06:18:34,340
I had a great time playing, uh, um...

7700
06:18:34,340 --> 06:18:36,480
Five Nights at Freddy's Secret of the Mimic.

7701
06:18:37,300 --> 06:18:37,960
Um...

7702
06:18:37,960 --> 06:18:38,800
It wasn't as...

7703
06:18:38,800 --> 06:18:39,940
Okay, I will say that...

7704
06:18:39,940 --> 06:18:41,760
The scariest part though...

7705
06:18:41,760 --> 06:18:43,280
Was definitely...

7706
06:18:43,980 --> 06:18:44,640
Um...

7707
06:18:44,640 --> 06:18:45,220
Was...

7708
06:18:45,220 --> 06:18:46,740
Definitely the...

7709
06:18:46,740 --> 06:18:47,070
The...

7710
06:18:47,800 --> 06:18:48,300
The...

7711
06:18:48,300 --> 06:18:48,500
The cat.

7712
06:18:49,020 --> 06:18:49,380
I've...

7713
06:18:49,380 --> 06:18:51,140
Also, what the fuck was the cat?

7714
06:18:53,280 --> 06:18:55,120
What about the ghost cat?

7715
06:18:55,680 --> 06:18:57,920
Where the fuck does he come into play?

7716
06:18:58,140 --> 06:18:59,360
Who was he?

7717
06:18:59,780 --> 06:19:01,920
Like, he didn't even have a picture!

7718
06:19:07,640 --> 06:19:09,360
Who the fuck was he?

7719
06:19:09,480 --> 06:19:10,220
Tiger Rock?

7720
06:19:10,420 --> 06:19:13,660
I did not see any posters about the fucking cat!

7721
06:19:19,100 --> 06:19:21,600
There's a secret ending that explains...

7722
06:19:21,600 --> 06:19:21,680
Like...

7723
06:19:21,680 --> 06:19:22,360
Like...

7724
06:19:22,360 --> 06:19:22,680
Nope!

7725
06:19:23,020 --> 06:19:23,700
There was...

7726
06:19:23,700 --> 06:19:26,060
Did the Mimic inhabit the cat?

7727
06:19:27,020 --> 06:19:28,100
Was he...

7728
06:19:28,100 --> 06:19:28,280
Like...

7729
06:19:28,280 --> 06:19:30,060
Or was he like a separate thing?

7730
06:19:30,060 --> 06:19:31,100
Like...

7731
06:19:31,100 --> 06:19:33,580
He seemed to have different powers...

7732
06:19:33,580 --> 06:19:35,860
From the other fucking animatronic!

7733
06:19:36,340 --> 06:19:37,980
Why was he here?

7734
06:19:41,040 --> 06:19:41,760
Like...

7735
06:19:42,740 --> 06:19:44,620
It was a separate...

7736
06:19:44,620 --> 06:19:45,320
I was like...

7737
06:19:45,320 --> 06:19:47,660
Where did this cat ghost come from?

7738
06:19:51,240 --> 06:19:52,420
This cat...

7739
06:19:52,420 --> 06:19:53,320
It wasn't...

7740
06:19:53,320 --> 06:19:55,140
It wasn't even an animatronic!

7741
06:19:55,180 --> 06:19:56,680
It was just a straight up ghost!

7742
06:19:56,980 --> 06:19:57,600
Like...

7743
06:19:57,600 --> 06:19:59,960
I was getting haunted by the fucking ghost!

7744
06:19:59,960 --> 06:20:00,760
And...

7745
06:20:00,760 --> 06:20:01,060
And...

7746
06:20:01,760 --> 06:20:02,160
And M2!

7747
06:20:02,720 --> 06:20:03,940
And the Mimic!

7748
06:20:04,180 --> 06:20:05,340
I was so confused!

7749
06:20:10,760 --> 06:20:11,360
Yes...

7750
06:20:11,360 --> 06:20:13,500
Edwin's son's ghost...

7751
06:20:13,500 --> 06:20:14,760
Is the cat...

7752
06:20:14,760 --> 06:20:15,820
David...

7753
06:20:15,820 --> 06:20:16,060
Oh!

7754
06:20:16,180 --> 06:20:17,660
That's David?!

7755
06:20:17,660 --> 06:20:18,600
Oh my...

7756
06:20:18,600 --> 06:20:20,760
Now there's fucking ghosts?!

7757
06:20:20,760 --> 06:20:21,620
Like...

7758
06:20:21,620 --> 06:20:22,460
I thought...

7759
06:20:22,460 --> 06:20:23,240
Oh, to be fair...

7760
06:20:23,240 --> 06:20:24,480
The ghost of the children...

7761
06:20:24,480 --> 06:20:25,760
Inhabits the animatronics!

7762
06:20:25,860 --> 06:20:26,540
I don't know that!

7763
06:20:26,860 --> 06:20:29,020
But then that cat was just a straight up ghost!

7764
06:20:29,020 --> 06:20:31,240
That wasn't even an animatronic!

7765
06:20:31,580 --> 06:20:32,440
It was like a fucking...

7766
06:20:32,440 --> 06:20:35,520
David was just in some fucking mascot costume!

7767
06:20:35,780 --> 06:20:38,280
That wasn't even an animatronic anymore!

7768
06:20:39,220 --> 06:20:39,900
Like...

7769
06:20:41,260 --> 06:20:42,400
It was...

7770
06:20:42,400 --> 06:20:43,200
Like...

7771
06:20:43,200 --> 06:20:44,400
It was a straight up...

7772
06:20:44,400 --> 06:20:45,020
Like...

7773
06:20:45,020 --> 06:20:46,160
Mascot costume!

7774
06:20:48,600 --> 06:20:49,920
I was just like...

7775
06:20:49,920 --> 06:20:52,280
What the fuck did this guy come from?!

7776
06:20:52,280 --> 06:20:52,700
Like...

7777
06:20:52,700 --> 06:20:53,960
It's all about...

7778
06:20:53,960 --> 06:20:54,540
Yeah, I was re...

7779
06:20:54,540 --> 06:20:54,960
I remember...

7780
06:20:54,960 --> 06:20:55,480
I was like...

7781
06:20:55,480 --> 06:20:55,920
Yeah, I forgot!

7782
06:20:56,140 --> 06:20:58,640
The ghost of the children haunts the animatronics!

7783
06:20:58,880 --> 06:20:59,560
So then I...

7784
06:20:59,560 --> 06:21:01,180
I've just remembered that...

7785
06:21:01,180 --> 06:21:01,880
It like...

7786
06:21:01,880 --> 06:21:02,440
It like...

7787
06:21:02,440 --> 06:21:03,040
Fucked with me!

7788
06:21:03,120 --> 06:21:03,820
Because I was just like...

7789
06:21:03,820 --> 06:21:04,560
What the fuck is...

7790
06:21:04,560 --> 06:21:06,960
Why am I being chased by ghosts now?!

7791
06:21:06,960 --> 06:21:07,240
Like...

7792
06:21:07,240 --> 06:21:08,820
Who the fuck died?!

7793
06:21:08,820 --> 06:21:09,500
And I was like...

7794
06:21:09,500 --> 06:21:11,020
Oh, everybody died!

7795
06:21:16,900 --> 06:21:17,480
Um...

7796
06:21:17,480 --> 06:21:18,220
But yeah...

7797
06:21:18,220 --> 06:21:19,800
Thank you everybody for coming!

7798
06:21:20,100 --> 06:21:21,040
I had...

7799
06:21:21,040 --> 06:21:21,680
Um...

7800
06:21:21,680 --> 06:21:22,640
I had a great...

7801
06:21:22,640 --> 06:21:22,860
Like...

7802
06:21:22,860 --> 06:21:23,180
I'm like...

7803
06:21:23,180 --> 06:21:24,340
Why was he haunting me?!

7804
06:21:24,340 --> 06:21:25,900
What did I do?!

7805
06:21:25,900 --> 06:21:27,860
I was just chillin'!

7806
06:21:29,140 --> 06:21:31,740
I was just trying to steal your dad's plans!

7807
06:21:32,020 --> 06:21:32,800
But like...

7808
06:21:32,800 --> 06:21:34,320
Is that really a bad thing?!

7809
06:21:34,320 --> 06:21:36,560
You already hate your dad anyway, David!

7810
06:21:37,000 --> 06:21:37,480
Like...

7811
06:21:37,480 --> 06:21:38,920
Why are you haunting me?!

7812
06:21:38,920 --> 06:21:41,540
I'm basically sabotaging your dad's work!

7813
06:21:41,700 --> 06:21:43,440
You already fucking hate your dad!

7814
06:21:43,760 --> 06:21:44,560
I'm like...

7815
06:21:44,560 --> 06:21:46,920
Why am I getting chased by you?!

7816
06:21:50,540 --> 06:21:51,020
Anyway...

7817
06:21:51,020 --> 06:21:51,840
Anyway, guys...

7818
06:21:51,840 --> 06:21:53,040

7819
06:21:53,040 --> 06:21:53,840
Playing...

7820
06:21:53,840 --> 06:21:54,280
Um...

7821
06:21:54,280 --> 06:21:55,960
Friday Night's at Freddy's Secret of the Mimic!

7822
06:21:56,060 --> 06:21:57,660
I hope you guys had a great time too!

7823
06:21:57,940 --> 06:22:00,120
And having a great time trying to like...

7824
06:22:00,120 --> 06:22:02,420
Figure out what the fuck was going on at first!

7825
06:22:02,980 --> 06:22:03,400
Uh...

7826
06:22:03,400 --> 06:22:03,900
Hahahaha!

7827
06:22:05,680 --> 06:22:07,360
Hold on, I guess cause I...

7828
06:22:07,360 --> 06:22:08,620
Yeah, but that was M2!

7829
06:22:08,620 --> 06:22:10,680
He was chasing me because I didn't give him a ticket!

7830
06:22:11,440 --> 06:22:11,880
Hahahaha!

7831
06:22:13,760 --> 06:22:14,200
Um...

7832
06:22:14,200 --> 06:22:15,960
But thank y'all for coming, everybody!

7833
06:22:16,220 --> 06:22:18,980
I hope you guys had a great time hanging out with me today!

7834
06:22:20,420 --> 06:22:20,860
Um...

7835
06:22:20,860 --> 06:22:23,000
As always, everybody...

7836
06:22:23,000 --> 06:22:27,640
Stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing!

7837
06:22:27,880 --> 06:22:30,060
And if you stay up for me, head to bed!

7838
06:22:30,520 --> 06:22:31,000
Cause...

7839
06:22:31,000 --> 06:22:31,920
You deserve it!

7840
06:22:32,200 --> 06:22:33,700
I'll see you guys next time, everybody!

7841
06:22:34,020 --> 06:22:34,720
Bye, guys!

7842
06:22:35,060 --> 06:22:35,420
Bye!

7843
06:22:35,860 --> 06:22:36,300
Bye!

7844
06:22:36,300 --> 06:22:39,200
Also, the amount of times I got softlocked in the scene was fucking crazy!

7845
06:22:39,460 --> 06:22:39,920
Hahahaha!

7846
06:22:39,920 --> 06:22:41,240
I can't believe it!

7847
06:22:42,800 --> 06:22:45,560
Robot fucking pushed me against the wall!

7848
06:22:45,820 --> 06:22:47,240
And then like...

7849
06:22:47,240 --> 06:22:48,140
Kept me there!

7850
06:22:48,880 --> 06:22:49,480
Like...

7851
06:22:49,480 --> 06:22:49,840
Hahahaha!

7852
06:22:50,340 --> 06:22:51,340
That's fucking crazy!

7853
06:22:51,740 --> 06:22:52,820
Alright, I'll see you guys later!

7854
06:22:53,060 --> 06:22:53,360
Bye!

7855
06:22:53,360 --> 06:22:54,140
Bye!

7856

Bye!
