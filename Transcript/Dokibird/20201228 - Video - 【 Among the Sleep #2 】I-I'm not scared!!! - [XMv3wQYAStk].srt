00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Alright guys, are you guys ready for the spooky time?

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,660
Because I'm not fucking ready.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,000
Not fucking ready.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,740
Oh god.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,500
Let me close the music.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,720
It's time to close the music chat.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,180
And...

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,880
Oh god.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,320
It's too loud.

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,240
My dad came back with bubble tea.

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,460
So I'm gonna scream bubble tea in my head.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,850
Oh god.

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,170
I hate all of you.

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,370
I hate this.

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,030
I hate this.

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,470
Oh god.

17
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:44,990
Continued story.

18
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:45,730
Yes.

19
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,170
Oh god.

20
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,230
May the odds ever be in your favor.

21
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,390
Ready for the speedrun.

22
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:53,670
You're right.

23
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:53,990
You're right.

24
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,910
I shouldn't be scared.

25
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,310
I'm gonna finish this in 10 minutes chat.

26
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,390
Ready for the last 10 minutes of this game?

27
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,430
Oh shit.

28
00:00:59,530 --> 00:00:59,910

29
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:00,990
Alright.

30
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:01,830
Where are you?

31
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,890
Oh shit.

32
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,490
Hey Teddy.

33
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,730
Hey Teddy.

34
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:06,890
Okay.

35
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,130

36
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:08,690
Oh my god.

37
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,410
I hate how this looks.

38
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,230
I need to fix the sensitivity.

39
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:13,490
Okay.

40
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,070

41
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,550

00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,510
Oh god.

43
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,750
Oh god.

44
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,190
She seemed so sad and desperate.

45
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,090
You don't think I...

46
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:26,330
OH!

47
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,930

00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,450

00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,050

Shit.

61
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,900
What do you mean I fell?

62
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,460
What do you mean?

63
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,040
That was like part of the loading screen.

64
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

65
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,160
Chat.

66
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,180
Don't be fucking stupid.

67
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,040
That was part of the loading screen guys.

68
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:03,920
I...

69
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,980
That's not true.

70
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,080
Yeah.

71
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,720
I just loaded into the game guys.

72
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,980
What the fuck do you mean?

73
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,280
I just loaded into the game.

74
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,940
What the fuck?

75
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,080
Don't be stupid chat.

76
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,400
I can't believe I fell there.

77
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,240
That was part of the loading cutscene.

78
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,620
Oh yeah.

79
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,600
I didn't do that.

80
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:32,900
Yeah.

81
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,620
I didn't die.

82
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,180

84
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,060
No.

85
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,140
That was just the loading screen.

86
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,500
It was like the loading screen.

87
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,160
It was a cutscene chat.

88
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,860
It was a cutscene.

89
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,080
I didn't even control the baby.

90
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,080

00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,780

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,400
Thank you so much.

94
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,640
Oh shit.

95
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,640
I mean...

96
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,020
Ah.

97
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,500
How about Bloodheart?

98
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:54,940
Okay.

99
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,200
God.

100
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:56,780
This is one...

101
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,940
This is the last level guys.

102
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,320
This is the second last level.

103
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,560
It was plot.

104
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:03,860
Yeah.

105
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,960
It was supposed to happen.

106
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,260
God.

107
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,340
Clearly.

108
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,220
You guys have never played this game before.

109
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,040
It's canon.

110
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,660
Exactly.

111
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,260
Exactly.

112
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,420
I need to hydrate before I go in.

113
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,040
Let me...

114
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,300
Get some tears in me first.

115
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,540
Get some tears in me.

116
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,460
Before I cry it all out.

117
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,400
I choked on water.

118
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,940
There's too many tears.

119
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,340
Oh god.

120
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,740
I hate this.

121
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,420

122
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,300
I'm so fucking hate this.

123
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:48,910
I'm so fucking hate this.

124
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,130
Okay.

125
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,470
Alright.

126
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,470
I'm processing.

127
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,030
Oh god.

128
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,930
Oh god.

129
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,450
What is this?

130
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,770
What is this level?

131
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,900
What is...

132
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,320
It's so dark.

133
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,460
No.

134
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,560
I hate this.

135
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,060
Let me play as kids or babies.

136
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,680
Oh.

137
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,740
This is so dark.

138
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,680
Oh god.

139
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,560
Oh god.

140
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:30,640
Oh god.

141
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,740
Oh god.

142
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,830
I'm gonna get out of here.

143
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,790
Why are there puzzles?

144
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,790
Why are there puzzles?

145
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,950
Wait.

146
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,490
How do I get Teddy out?

147
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,510
I forgot the controls.

148
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,890
How do I get him out?

149
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:54,650
Teddy.

150
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,570
How do I get Teddy out?

151
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,790
Oh god.

152
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:04,850
Guys.

153
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,410
Guys.

154
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,290
How do I get Teddy out?

155
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,330
Was it F?

156
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,310
Teddy.

157
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,010
That's right.

158
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,270
Teddy.

159
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,550
Okay.

160
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,490
Okay.

161
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,690
Everything is fine.

162
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,910
Everything is fine.

163
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:18,950
Everything is fine.

164
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,030
It's a puzzle.

165
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,830
It's a...

166
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,590
It's a puzzle.

167
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,610
Everything...

168
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,310
Oh god.

169
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,090
I hate this.

170
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,850
I hate this.

171
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,110
Baby slowly walk.

172
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:34,910
Baby walk.

00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,430
Oh god.

174
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,830
What is...

175
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,490
Oh god.

176
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,150
I'm getting goosebumps already.

177
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,350
Let me...

178
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,650
Let me turn up the volume just a tiny bit more.

179
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,570
Oh my god.

180
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,330
Oh god.

181
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,810
I'm getting sheer heart attack.

182
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:48,730
Twenty.

183
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,210

Thank you so much.

187
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,050
Okay.

188
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,010
Awww.

189
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,440
I forgot.

190
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,700
I forgot the climbing sound.

191
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,720
I hate it whenever he has to climb.

192
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,020
I hate this.

193
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,380
I hate this sound when he's climbing.

194
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,940
I wanna go back to art.

195
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,720
I wanna draw again.

196
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,430
I wanna draw.

197
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,330
I wanna get back to art.

198
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,690

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,670
AHHHHH.

201
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,470
I don't wanna open the door.

202
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,190
I don't wanna open the door.

203
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,250
Don't make me open the door.

204
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,280
Oh.

205
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,140

206
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:57,720
Oh.

211
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,730
What happened?

212
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,450
What the fuck?

213
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,850
What the fuck?

214
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,790

219
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,810
Okay.

220
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,350
How do I get up?

221
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:26,910

222
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,530

00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,110
I hate this.

225
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,650
You got it right.

226
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,470
Thank you.

227
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:46,850
Oh.

228
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,640
What did I break?

229
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,200
I'm sorry.

230
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:56,800
What?

231
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,720
Why?

232
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,300

I hate this.

249
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,840
You didn't miss anything.

250
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,640
Felicity!

251
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,800
Thank you so much for the rain.

252
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,640
Oh.

253
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,080
Let me go under the table.

254
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,640
Let me go under the table before I say anything.

255
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,480
I'm gonna get straight Felicity.

256
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,020
Thank you for the rain.

257
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,780
I'm safe under this table.

258
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,840
I am safe.

259
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,860
I am safe.

260
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,080
I gotta be safe when I thank people for raids.

261
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:03,900
But thank you.

262
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,360
I hope you had a good stream.

263
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,940
Play Warframe.

264
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,580
Okay.

265
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:07,800
Alright.

266
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,560
I got this.

267
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,260
Baby's strong.

268
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,370

269
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,150
Oh god.

270
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,030

271
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,310
Thank you for the tier one.

272
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,630
For five woods.

273
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,830
I just spent two hours reading this.

274
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,870
Holy shit.

275
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,650
You get some pork nights real quick for Felicity.

276
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,170
I hope you are doing well with your research paper.

277
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,910
I am dying as a...

278
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,030

279
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,690

I'm laughing out my pain right now.

294
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,230

299
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,010
They miss no.

300
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,810
They miss everything.

301
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,750
They miss everything.

302
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,910
Please don't hurt me.

303
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,970
What the fuck?

304
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:34,910
Where am I?

305
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:36,730
What?

306
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,850
What the fuck?

307
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,350
Where am I?

308
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,550
What happened?

309
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,050
Okay.

310
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:45,510
Easter egg.

311
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,310
Okay.

312
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:47,910
Pain.

313
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:48,990
Everything.

314
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,430
All I feel is pain.

315
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,930
I don't know what just happened.

316
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,330
Did I open this door?

317
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:56,670
Please.

318
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,910
Please.

319
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,250
Oh.

320
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,950
Did I get fall damage?

321
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:07,970
What was that?

322
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,230
Give me a walkthrough and take me out of this hell.

323
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,630
Give me a walkthrough and take me out of this hell.

324
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,700
It's not this.

325
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:30,860
Aww.

326
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,580
Why do I have to walk through a licking lint through?

327
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,680
Oh god.

328
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,960
Why did they give me a maze?

329
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,940
Why do I have a maze?

330
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,480
Why do I have a maze?

331
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,460
I don't know.

332
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,560
I don't even know what's happening.

333
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,860
I don't even know what's going on.

334
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,870
Oh god.

335
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,550
Oh god.

336
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,330
Did you speed boost Amphida?

337
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:16,150
Did you speed boost Amphida?

338
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,090
Baby crawl?

339
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,530
Baby crawl.

340
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,830
Where can I crack this?

341
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,390
This is where I need them.

342
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,370
Oh god.

343
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:29,730
I was.

344
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,790
Oh my god.

345
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:32,810
The real.

346
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,750
monster was me all along.

347
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,390
What the fuck kind of shadow is this?

348
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,830
The real monster was me all along.

349
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,750
The

350
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,550
real monster was me all along.

351
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,150
It's always the shadows.

352
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,970
It's always the shadows.

353
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:55,530
Do I fall?

354
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,290
Baby fall?

355
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,690
Baby fall.

356
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:01,930
Oh shit.

357
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,350
What the fuck?

358
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,540
Baby obviously has a GoPro.

359
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
Oh key?

360
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,180
What is this key bullshit?

361
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,220
Is this holding a use none to throw it?

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:18,960
Is this holding a use none to throw it?

363
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,240
None to throw it?

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,440
What do you mean none to throw it?

365
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,420
What?

366
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,180
None to throw it?

367
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:27,880
What?

368
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,240
None.

369
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,440
Alright.

370
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,210
None to throw it.

371
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:43,950
Okay.

372
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:44,590
Up here?

373
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,210
Is it not?

374
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,370
No it was right click.

375
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,170
What the fuck?

376
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,090
Nice and nice air.

377
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,170
Dude.

378
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,430
Dude.

379
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,660
Baby snort.

380
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,860
Oh god.

381
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,460
Oh god.

382
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:01,920
Oh.

383
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,320

384
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:02,980

I'm so sorry.

387
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,260
I can't see me.

388
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,700
I'm safe.

389
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,960
If I can't see you.

390
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,060
You can't see me.

391
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,040
It's okay.

392
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,580
We don't have to keep playing.

393
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,580
I'm safe.

394
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,700
I'm safe.

395
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,100
I'm in my safe space.

396
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,020
I'm in my safe space.

397
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,180
Baby hide.

398
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
Oh god.

399
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,660
Oh god.

400
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,260
Okay.

401
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,640
I can get a little more in the sleep gap.

402
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,380
I can get a little more in the sleep gap.

403
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,200
Yep.

404
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,000
Here I am.

405
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,580
Here I am.

406
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,420
Open sesame.

407
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,140
Open sesame.

408
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,660
Okay.

409
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,460
Baby snort.

410
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:52,860
Oh god.

411
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,400
Okay.

412
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,140
Okay.

413
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,520
What's this?

414
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,080
Is this puzzles?

415
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,280
Oh shit.

416
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,860
She's singing.

417
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,120
Why are you singing?

418
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,600
Why is your...

419
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,080
I had very many spells of hypermorphism and anxiety when I was a kid.

420
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,600
And I still can't explain properly.

421
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,020
Oh god.

422
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,980
Oh god.

423
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,500
Oh god.

424
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,140
I hate this.

425
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
I hate this.

426
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,380
I want to look at a walk through right now.

427
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,260
You hear that?

428
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,880
No I did not.

429
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,340
Bear.

430
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,260
I didn't even hear that.

431
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,700
Now that you said it.

432
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,780
Why did you have to say shit?

433
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,260
Bear.

434
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,280
Because I didn't hear it.

435
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,040
Why did they want me to climb up?

436
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,060
Oh god.

437
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,580
Please.

438
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,080
I have enough stuff to worry about.

439
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,260
Damn.

440
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,660
I have enough stuff to worry about.

441
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,980
Now you're giving me puzzles.

442
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,560
I'm a baby here.

443
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,340
I'm a baby.

444
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,580
What are the tiles?

445
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,980
I'm fucking 200.

446
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,940
You think a baby knows how to do...

447
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,200
Oh god.

448
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:29,940
Please.

449
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,400
How is a little baby gonna do puzzles exactly?

450
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,690
I was a dumb baby.

451
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,910
I'm a dumb as fuck baby.

452
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,150
Oh wait.

453
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:48,290
No.

454
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:48,610
I'm smart.

455
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,210
God.

456
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,110
I'm so fucking smart.

457
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,270
Look at that.

458
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,180
Baby is Gordon Freeman.

459
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,400
You can do puzzles when you're too free.

460
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,560
Oh god.

461
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,040
I don't know what I'm scared of.

462
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,900
I don't know what can I be scared of.

463
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,060
What am I scared of right now?

464
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,220
What is it?

465
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,840
I don't even know what that is.

466
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,860
I don't even know what that is.

467
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,430
Why are you scared?

468
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,170
Baby what happened?

469
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,190
Baby what's going on?

470
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,540
Okay.

471
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,200
Okay.

472
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,100
Time to breathe.

473
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,820
Time to breathe.

474
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,140
Okay.

475
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,460
Baby's breathing.

476
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,420
Baby's alive.

477
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,440
Cause he's breathing.

478
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,100
Put

479
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,520

480
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,260
Okay.

481
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,340
Will this lead me?

482
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,440
Where are you taking me?

483
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,420
Oh god.

484
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,900
Oh god.

485
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,400
A baby laying as a baby.

486
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,680
Oh god.

487
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,360

I love you.

490
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:32,690
I love you.

491
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,210
Please don't leave me.

492
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,150
Please don't leave me.

493
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,390

Please don't leave me.

502
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,570
Okay... I hate this.

503
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,620
I was hitting just about every anxiety trigger I have and this is not okay.

504
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,580
Oh my god Felicity I'm sorry!

505
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:42,500
I am just as scared if not fucked up as you are right now with this game.

516
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,300
Does baby have to climb right now?

517
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,380
Or does baby have to... Oh god I have to not climb.

518
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,020

519
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,980
I have to knock this down.

520
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,380
Don't worry baby can do baseball.

553
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,060
Wow guys, wasn't that scary guys?

554
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,880
I'm totally playing this game right now.

555
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,400
How the fuck do I get out of here?

556
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,620
Wait, what happened to my shelf?

557
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,100
Wait, what happened to my shelf?

558
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,420
Where did you go?

559
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,500
Oh, what?

560
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,300

561
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,240
Alright, did I run?

562
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,820
Shit, no, do I... where's my shelf?

563
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,500
What the heck happened to it?

564

Where do I go?

565
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,440
No, wait no.

566
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,800
Hello, you're on It's Not My Morning.

567
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,700
Hello Mello.

568
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,280
I am crying Mello.

569
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,480
What if we climb... oh shit, up.

570
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,300
The answer was in front of us all along.

571
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,240
The answer was in front of us all along.

572
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,900
The answer was in front of us all along.

573
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:17,980

00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,250
Wow chat, wasn't that a great game guys?

00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,690
I can't believe we beat it.

576
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,930
This was our objective all along.

577
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:28,050
I can't believe we beat it.

578
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:28,050
This was our objective all along.

579
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,570
Wow, we did it.

00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,150
See here, we're safe here.

581
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,730
We never had to come up.

582
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:34,330
We did it.

583
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,550
We beat the game.

584
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,830
Wow, holy shit, we... congratulations everyone.

585
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,530
We finished the game.

586
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:48,730
Dammit.

587
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,810
No need for food.

588
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,050
We have books and a tiny cabinet.

589
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,030
Yep.

590
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,610
We're still good at this video game.

591
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,910
Thanks everyone for coming.

592
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,630
Stupid babies don't starve.

593
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,950
They don't need to eat.

594
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,370
I've never raised a baby before.

595
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,730
I assume they don't need to eat, right?

596
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,910
I mean, we have books and a lamp.

597
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,110
And teddy.

598
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,810
Wait, why can't I bring out teddy?

599
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:24,790
Teddy.

600
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,210
Oh wait, I need to stand up.

601
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:26,970
We have books.

602
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,170
Uh, okay.

603
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,110
Books, teddy, and a light.

604
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,410
Babies don't eat.

605
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,110
Okay, alright.

606
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,790
Alright, um.

607
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,210
They only poop exactly.

608
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,530
Babies, that's why babies are fucking useless.

609
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,090
What do we need babies for?

610
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,210
Do teddies have n- oh my god.

611
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,530
What is this?

612
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,910
Oh, is this another easter egg?

613
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,390
How do I get up?

614
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,210
How does baby get up?

615
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,410
Oh god, what is this?

616
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,870
What is this?

617
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,610
Oh my god, baby stop drawing on walls!

618
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,890
What are these drawings, dude?

619
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,910
Okay, not gonna lie, these are really good drawings for a fucking child to draw.

620
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,790
Draw like this.

621
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:36,670
This is a god fucking- My- the ball squeaks in the background from my dog scared me.

622
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,830
The ball squeeze actually spooked me out.

623
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,860
What the fuck?

624
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,260
Is she okay?

625
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,220
Is her back okay?

626
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,120
She needs to see a doctor.

627
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,180
I'm sorry for opening the door.

628
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,280
I'm so sorry.

629
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,280
I'll never open doors again.

630
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,480
What the fuck was that sound?

631
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,790
What am I afraid of?

632
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,850
What am I supposed to be afraid of?

633
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,070
I don't know!

634
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,910
What am I so sorry afraid of?

635
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,570
I need to open doors again.

636
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,450
I guess not from Minecraft Street.

637
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,190
Squiggly screens, I guess.

638
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,260
Wait, why won't it let me open this?

639
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,500
Oh

640
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,620
god.

641
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,200
Oh god.

642
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,260
Oh god, what is this ambience?

643
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,450
Oh, baby, just one more juice box.

644
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,450
I hate this so much.

645
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:56,870
I...

646
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,750
Please, I just want to get- please just- just chase me.

647
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:05,650
Just- just- just- Just take me out already, mister.

648
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,050
Just...

649
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,560
Please.

650
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,200
Please.

651
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,080
Oh, I don't know where you are, mister monster.

652
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,400
Please.

653
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,580
Please.

654
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,760
Just...

655
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,940
I hate this.

656
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,480
Please, no more ambience, please.

657
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,140
Where do I go?

658
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,820
God, don't make me- don't make me go through this.

659
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,960
There's so many bottles!

660
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,620
What the fuck is Baby supposed to do with all these bottles?

661
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,420
Wait, okay, wait, wait, I got this.

662
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,480
Okay.

663
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,400
Alright, watch this.

664
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,480
I'm not gonna knock down anything.

665
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,600
One.

666
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,400
Watch this pro gamer move.

667
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,000
Baby's skinny enough for this.

668
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,660
Oh god.

669
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,420
Oh god, don't you dare fall.

670
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,760
Don't you dare fall!

671
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,220
I think I'm stuck, guys.

672
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,640
No!

673
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,540
I'm fucked up!

674
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,380
I am so sorry!

675
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,240
I'm fucked up!

676
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,760
Ahhh!

677
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,920
Close the door!

678
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,120
Wow!

679
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:17,820
Wow!

680
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,420
I'm so sorry!

681
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,780
No!

682
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,240
Guys!

683
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,300
Please!

684
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,320
Please!

685
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,640
I don't know how to close this!

686
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,080
I don't know how to close it!

687
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,500
I don't know how I live!

688
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,460
I'm trying to get closer and he just walked away.

689
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,600
He just walked away.

690
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,980
He actually just walked away.

691
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Hey, I'm alive.

692
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,900
Okay.

693
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:08,680
Okay.

694
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,980
There's the other door.

695
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,400
Okay.

696
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,760
Okay.

697
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,940
Alright, so what we learned today...

698
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,920
What we learned is...

699
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,080
Slow and steady wins the race.

700
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,280
Alright, there's no more bottles.

701
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,400
There's no more bottles.

702
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,100
The cat heard us and there's no bottles.

703
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,940
Cat heard me.

704
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,220
There's no more bottles.

705
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,000
Okay, let me open this.

706
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,240
Let me open you.

707
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,540
Why is there just a chair?

708
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,840
Why is there just a chair right here?

709
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,120
Why is there just a chair right here?

710
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,820
What the fuck?

711
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,040
I'm not going in there.

712
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:55,840
What the fuck?

713
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,320
I'm not going to go in there.

714
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,660
Why is there just a chair there?

715
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,800
Would you like to take a seat, baby?

716
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,960
Would you like to take a seat, baby?

717
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,920
I still don't want to close the door.

718
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,000
Close the door.

719
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,640
Close the door.

720
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,710
I learned how to close the door.

721
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,130
I learned how to do it.

722
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,090
I did it.

723
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,230
What the fuck?

724
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,890
I didn't see any glass.

725
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,570
Where is the glass?

726
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:31,850
Where did I break...

727
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,130
Where did I break the glass?

728
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:34,910
Where?

729
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,390
Please, explain to me.

730
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:37,770
I...

731
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,570
I'm like slowly walking here.

732
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,490
And they're like, yep, you broke glass.

733
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,410
And they're like, yep, you broke glass.

734
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,480
Like, okay, you know what?

735
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:49,780
Fuck this.

736
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,620
Oh my god!

737
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,560
How the fuck am I going to pass this?

738
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,960
Excuse me?

739
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,480
This one glass bottle here?

740
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,980
This one glass bottle here?

741
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,060
Yeah, but where do I run to?

742
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,200
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

743
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:07,840
Just run?

744
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,720
Okay, okay, okay.

745
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,440
No, I got this.

746
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,420
I'm not a fool.

747
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,160
I'm not going to touch you.

748
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,400
I'm not going to touch you.

749
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:25,420
Let me in.

750
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,000
Let me in.

751
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,120
Alright.

752
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,520
Oh my god, please.

753
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,680
Where do I go?

754
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,540
Dude, fuck this maze shit.

755
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,960
Nadia, thanks so much for the follow.

756
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,180
Thank you, thank you.

757
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,320
Thank you.

758
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,440
Where do I even go?

759
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,620
Not only are they giving me bottles, they...

760
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,600
Is that just a shoe?

761
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,240
Okay.

762
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,200
I was going to be like, not only...

763
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,640
Um...

764
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,760
Dude, I'm a baby.

765
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,880
That's the premise.

766
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,580
I'm a fucking baby trapped in hell.

767
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,180
Like, I don't even know.

768
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,000
Not only do they...

769
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,120
Do they have bottles, I had to hide from a monster, and they had to give me a maze?

770
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,000
Like, what the fuck is...

771
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,080
I'm just a fucking baby.

772
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:30,780
Come on.

773
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,120
Just give me one.

774
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,540
Not twenty of these things.

775
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,940
Like, I don't know where to go.

776
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,120
Oh, there's a bottle.

777
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:46,930
You play a baby exploring a dreamlike world evading...

778
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,670
Yo, that's a better explanation than me.

779
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,930
All I said was like, I'm a fucking baby trapped in hell.

780
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:59,290
I'm scared there's fall damage, so I'm just gonna...

781
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:00,390
Boop.

782
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,030
Wouldn't it be fucked up if you gave a baby fall damage too?

783
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:07,910
Open.

784
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,410
Oh, god.

785
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,500
Where's the memory?

786
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,240
Where's the memory?

787
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,900
Okay, okay, I'm safe in the memory.

788
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,040
I'm safe.

789
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,640
I'm safe in memories.

790
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,740
Memory is safe.

791
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,640
Memory is safe.

792
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:30,700
Please.

793
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,620
Memory is safe.

794
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,200
I swear, if a monster comes here...

795
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,360
How does a baby even end up in...

796
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,800
I don't know.

797
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,820
Baby did a bad thing.

798
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,620
Hurry where?

799
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,680
Do I have to run?

800
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,160
Oh, god.

801
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,460
Oh, no.

802
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:49,820
It's here.

803
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:55,430
Okay.

804
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:58,870
Okay.

805
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,170
Where do I go?

806
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,210
Where the fuck do I go?

807
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,350
Here?

808
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,470
Baby run.

809
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:20,490
Baby run.

810
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:21,750
Baby fucking run.

811
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,550
Baby, please!

812
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,890
Run faster, baby!

813
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:24,830
Baby?

814
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:25,510
Baby.

815
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:26,110
Baby.

816
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,590
Oh, god.

817
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:27,030
Please.

818
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,450
Please.

819
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,030
No!

820
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:29,630
No!

821
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:30,110
No!

822
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:31,370
No!

823
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,530
Oh, god.

824
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,890
That was the... Yeah, dude, I don't give a fuck about bear.

825
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:36,610
You can take him.

826
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:36,970
Please.

827
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:37,890
Just take the bear.

828
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:38,770
I don't care.

829
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,210
Let's just take the bear.

830
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,470
Oh, god.

831
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:43,990
Oh, no.

832
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,880
I thought you were that online.

833
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,200
You should just let him take the bear.

834
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,160
You stupid baby.

835
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,910
Well, at least we know there's no fall damage.

836
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,030
At least we know.

837
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,530
There's no fall damage.

838
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,600
He has no heart.

839
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:14,960
Oh, god.

840
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,140
Give me light.

841
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:16,740
Light.

842
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:21,060
You are as good as... I'll make a traumatizing game about baby.

843
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,600
Oh, oh.

844
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,640
Baby run.

845
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,860
Baby run.

846
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,920
And he's just looking right.

847
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,720
Get what you want.

848
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,100
No, no.

849
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,080
Baby's found.

850
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,180
Oh, hey, mom.

851
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,300
Hey, there.

852
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,340
Hey, mom.

853
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,080
Mom!

854
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,860
Hey, mom!

855
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,500
Please.

856
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,440
Oh, she's in...

857
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,040
Oh!

858
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,540
Oh!

859
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:45,920
God!

860
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,340
No!

861
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,480
Okay, mom's an alcoholic.

862
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,140
Okay.

863
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,140
Alright.

864
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,000
At least we know that.

865
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,640
Mom's an alcoholic.

866
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,500
Mom is an alcoholic.

867
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,360
Please, baby.

868
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,220
Please.

869
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,900
Baby.

870
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,200
Oh!

871
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:09,600
Oh!

872
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,420
Oh!

873
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,260
He's

874
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:19,850
like, you can't hurt me.

875
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:20,810
You can't hurt me!

876
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:21,690
You can't hurt me!

877
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:22,550
I'm like...

878
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,220
I will not take it.

879
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:28,540
Oh.

880
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,460
What

881
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,720
mommy says.

882
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,940
Mommy, I'm sorry.

883
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,660
Mommy, I'm sorry.

884
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,100
Please.

885
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,060
I'm sorry, mommy.

886
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,680
None of us want that.

887
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,260
Oh, God.

888
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:47,700
Please.

889
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,600
Please, baby.

890
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,960
You're faster than this.

891
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,340
You made me.

892
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:52,620
Please.

893
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,320
You're faster.

894
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,020
I'm sorry.

895
00:37:59,160 --> 00:37:59,900
I'm not

896
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,520
kidding you.

897
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,140
What?

898
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,260
Did she just say, I will find you?

899
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:13,880
Did she just say, I will find you?

900
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,720
What?

901
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,600
What?

902
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:28,820
Technically,

903
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,600
I was...

904
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,280
I was dying mentally.

905
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,120
I was getting killed in my mind.

906
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,570
It's okay.

907
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,750
We don't need Teddy anymore.

908
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,190
We don't need him.

909
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,470
It's all... It's you and me, chat.

910
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,850
All I need is just chat.

911
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,270
Who the fuck gives a fuck about...

912
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,750
Who gives a... Am I stuck?

913
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,750
Wait.

914
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,930
Wait, I'm stuck.

915
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:01,750
Oh shit.

916
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:02,310
No, I'm sorry.

917
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:02,830
I fucked up.

918
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,330
Wait.

919
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,590
I'm stuck.

920
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,280
Wait.

921
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,880
I broke the game.

922
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,600
I broke the game.

923
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,360
I can't even...

924
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,980
I can't even turn the wheel.

925
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,000
How did... I'm trying.

926
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,980
I didn't... Okay chat, I am trying.

927
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,380
I actually broke the game.

928
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,200
Please.

929
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:25,800
Oh no.

930
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,960
I can't turn the wheel.

931
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,580
It won't let me turn it.

932
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,080
I actually broke the game.

933
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,800
Oh my god.

934
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,300
Wait.

935
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,960
Oh my god.

936
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,660
I can't even...

937
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,520
Wait.

938
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,140
I can't even... exclamation point.

939
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,320
I actually broke the game.

940
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,300
How do I fuck up that badly?

941
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:58,560
How do I... How do I fuck up?

942
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,640
I can't.

943
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,900
It won't let me turn it.

944
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,380
Wheels.

945
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,860
My natural... It won't... I can't even...

946
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,480
press escape chat.

947
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,840
I had to... I actually broke the game.

948
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,160
I actually broke the game.

949
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,700
Holy shit.

950
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,460
It won't let me turn the wheel.

951
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,140
Oh god.

952
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,880
Where is... I actually...

953
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,020
Oh my god.

954
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,840
I actually... Chat, if I restart this...

955
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,880
Is it... Oh please don't make me replay this part again.

956
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,480
Oh no.

957
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,200
Please.

958
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,280
Let me turn the wheel.

959
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,380
I'm so sorry.

960
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,700
I didn't mean anything I say.

961
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,960
I'll save bear.

962
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,780
I'll save the bear.

963
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,200
I love bear.

964
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,440
I love the bear.

965
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,980
I'm so sorry.

966
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,700
Please let me turn the wheel.

967
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:56,800
No!

968
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,410
Oh no.

969
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,350
It won't let me...

970
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,530
do escape too.

971
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,690
I can't even pull up my options.

972
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:11,590
Alright.

973
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,270
Game.

974
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,610
I'm so sorry.

975
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,750
I can't even open the chest.

976
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,890
I can't even open the chest.

977
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:21,570
Okay.

978
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,610
At least mom can't find me again.

979
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:24,270
Alright.

980
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:24,690
Chat.

981
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:28,390
Let me... I have to... I have to... I have to...

982
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,610
restart the game.

983
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,570
I can't believe I broke the game.

984
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:32,370
I... I...

985
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:35,670
I actually can't believe I broke it during this stage.

986
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,790
What can I not do, chat?

987
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,310
What can I not do?

988
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,830
Can't turn the wheel apparently.

989
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,470
Holy shit.

990
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,050
I just don't know how to turn wheels.

991
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,870
Well, I'll be right back.

992
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,690
I'm gonna... well, I will still be here.

993
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,870
I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna restart the game.

994
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:52,230
I guess.

995
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,790
I guess I'll just restart the... Oh my god.

996
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,290
I guess I'll just restart the game.

997
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,390
I guess I'll just restart the game.

998
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:00,870
Oh my god, dude.

999
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,030
Where is it gonna take me?

1000
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,970
Oh my... I'm so sad.

1001
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,490
I swear if it makes me do that level again...

1002
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,520
The nightmare being recursive is part of the requirement.

1003
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,240
Oh god, I have to go through this.

1004
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,100
Oh god, where is this gonna restart me?

1005
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,760
Where are you gonna restart me?

1006
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,300
Oh!

1007
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,460
Oh, thank god.

1008
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,140
Thank god.

1009
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,160
Oh, thank god.

1010
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,620
Oh, thank god it's here.

1011
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,380
Oh, thank god it restarted me here.

1012
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,380
Doki's laughing at me.

1013
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,280
Doki, Doki.

1014
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,460
Oh god.

1015
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,800
Thank you.

1016
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,620
I'll close the door.

1017
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,200
Maybe it's because I didn't close the door.

1018
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,300
Holy shit, I was... I was gonna be like, where are you gonna restart me game?

1019
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:50,640
Okay.

1020
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,240
Alright, I won't break it this time.

1021
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,450
Oh god, I did it.

1022
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,830
See, now I can open this chest too.

1023
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,830
Now I can open this chest too.

1024
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:10,710
Boom.

1025
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,130
Boom.

1026
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,070
Wait, how do I do this?

1027
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,730
If I click it really fast, maybe I can do it.

1028
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:19,090
Oh god, is it gonna make me go out?

1029
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:21,950
Is it gonna make me go out?

1030
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:24,490
The F block?

1031
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,830
I don't need Teddy.

1032
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,150
I don't need Teddy.

1033
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:30,590
I have the F block.

1034
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,750
I'll just put this on top.

1035
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:37,110
Who needs Teddy when I have blocks?

1036
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:39,570
Okay, that didn't work.

1037
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,810
Okay, maybe I do need Teddy.

1038
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:42,870
Wait, no, no.

1039
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:43,530
I don't need Teddy.

1040
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:46,990
I have... okay, I was gonna say... we don't need him!

1041
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:48,350
I lied!

1042
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,330
We don't need him!

1043
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:50,870
God, just...

1044
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,610
God, why is your arm so bent?

1045
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:56,770
Who needs to... turns out Baby is actually some drunk dude running and hiding from cops.

1046
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:57,970
AKA a monster.

1047
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:00,190
Okay, alright.

1048
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,070
Yeah, we have book and lamp.

1049
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:05,990
And that's all.

1050
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:11,490
Okay, I swear, I can just get this lamp and then just put it on... there should be another ending where we leave without Teddy.

1051
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,930
Cause I would take that ending.

1052
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,650
I would take the ending without Teddy.

1053
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:15,270
Like, fuck him.

1054
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:21,030
Like... If I could get an ending without him, I'll fucking take it.

1055
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,260
Oh, God.

1056
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:27,900
Oh, God!

1057
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:37,490
Where do I even go?

1058
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:48,900
Is this... Is this the street?

1059
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,100
I hate this.

1060
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,580
I hate this.

1061
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:58,390
Oh, God!

1062
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,210
So what?

1063
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:00,910
I'm fucking gonna make it such as a bug!

1064
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:02,730
Thank you!

1065
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,480
Let's see how that ends.

1066
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,760
Where the fuck do I go?

1067
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,750
Oh my God.

1068
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,110
I don't know where to go.

1069
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,410
Baby go up?

1070
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,070
Where's up?

1071
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,640
Where is up?

1072
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,940
Where... Where... Where is...

1073
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:36,440
Baby go?

1074
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,460
I'm back here.

1075
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:45,350
Puppies?

1076
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,050
What if... Oh...

1077
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:50,770
Oh, I get it.

1078
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:52,270
Right?

1079
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:53,870
Right?

1080
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,210
See,

1081
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,140
I don't need Teddy.

1082
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,560
I don't need him.

1083
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,420
I have his arm.

1084
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,880
I don't need him.

1085
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,480
I have his fucking arm.

1086
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,740
Who the fuck needs him?

1087
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:09,900
I don't need him.

1088
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,140
No, baby.

1089
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,080
Never go down.

1090
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,080
No, baby.

1091
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:19,080
Never go down.

1092
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:19,860
No, baby.

1093
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:19,860
Never go down.

1094
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,520
Who the fuck needs him?

1095
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:23,560
Who the fuck needs him?

1096
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,820
I have a fucking arm.

1097
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,340
That's all I need.

1098
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,660
How the hell would anyone figure that out?

1099
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:32,220
How the hell would anyone figure that out?

1100
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:43,890
I'm back home.

1101
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:44,290
Nothing.

1102
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:47,980
Stop crying, little baby.

1103
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,340
You have an arm!

1104
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,320
Teddy was the only constant and you needed a friend to solve the last puzzle.

1105
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,640
Fuck Teddy, we don't need Teddy.

1106
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,640
I only have his arm.

1107
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,760
All I need was his arm.

1108
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,260
Oh god, it's getting darker.

1109
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,920
I don't like that.

1110
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,460
I don't like that it's getting darker guys.

1111
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,200
Oh god!

1112
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,240
Awww.

1113
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,580
Hey Teddy.

1114
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,100
You need my Teddy back.

1115
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,720
Oh god!

1116
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:31,420
Please!

1117
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,080
I don't even want him.

1118
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,900
I never meant to.

1119
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,080
I don't even want Teddy.

1120
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:40,900
What?

1121
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,840
Oh shit, hate.

1122
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,700
Can I look at her?

1123
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,460
Dude, she's a terrible mom.

1124
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:57,860
Like, I don't even want her.

1125
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,420
What the fuck?

1126
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,980
Let's go into the light.

1127
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,160
Hi little one.

1128
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,660
Come here.

1129
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,390
Did you like your gift?

1130
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,490
Oh is that dad?

1131
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:12,190
Hey dad.

1132
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:13,810
Is that acid?

1133
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:14,850
Yes.

1134
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:20,920
Acid?

1135
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,160
I'm sorry to hear.

1136
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:22,880
What?

1137
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,280
I think it's getting less and less related to this.

1138
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,040
Yeah.

1139
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:27,900
Oh!

1140
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,420
We did it!

1141
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,520
Oh god.

1142
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,780
We did it!

1143
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,440
We finished the game!

1144
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,160
Holy shit!

1145
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,420
We did it!

1146
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,680
We beat the game!

1147
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,540
I'm so proud.

1148
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,440
We did it chat.

1149
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:45,400
We did it together.

1150
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,400
We didn't fucking need Teddy.

1151
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,220
All we needed was his fucking arm.

1152
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,980
I don't have custody now.

1153
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,360
I don't have custody now.

1154
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:02,950
I don't have custody now.

1155
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:03,330
Shit.

1156
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:04,830
I like how there's like no music at all.

1157
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:05,450
It's just...

1158
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:06,810
Baby did it.

1159
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:07,650
Baby went up.

1160
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:07,890
Woo!

1161
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,310
We did it guys!

1162
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:10,130
Woo!

1163
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:12,990
All baby had to do was go up.

1164
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:16,850
We spent a whole game carrying all that extra weight when we all needed...

1165
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:17,910
Right, Lesser?

1166
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:19,190
We didn't need shit.

1167
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,870
All we needed was fucking arm.

1168
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:29,350
And then you had the option to hug her at the end by the way.

1169
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:31,030
Oh, who gives a fuck about her?

1170
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:31,490
Dude.

1171
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:38,390
Time for nononono... Nonononononononono.

1172
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,450
No, Hattage, no.

1173
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:43,910
Holy shit, chat.

1174
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:51,490
Teddy didn't do shit!

1175
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:56,030
He didn't do fucking shit this entire game other than giving me his arm.

1176
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:59,350
That was, like, his only benefits throughout that game!

1177
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:03,350
Oh, he was like, hey, I think, hey, did you hear that?

1178
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:06,730
Oh my, like after like the thing was gone, you'd be like, wow.

1179
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:07,890
Wow, baby.

1180
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:12,350
Did you hear that noise when I didn't hear shit, but he wants me to hear something?

1181
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:15,370
Teddy made you go into the wardrobe.

1182
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,110
And he put us in the mess in the store.

1183
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:22,370
But time for lightheartedness wholesome.

1184
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:25,830
Lightheartedness wholesomeness, holy shit.

1185
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:27,970
So we chat.

1186
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:31,510
I can't believe we beat the game.

1187
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,430
Another scary game under the belt.

1188
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:36,550
Did that say Batman?

1189
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:37,810
What the fuck?

1190
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:41,190
Wait, did you guys see that?

1191
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:42,170
It said Batman.

1192
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:44,450
What the fuck?

1193
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:45,190
Big Andy.

1194
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,390
Okay, some of these names are great.

1195
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:50,370
Big Andy.

1196
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:58,110
Big Andy, dude, there's no music.

1197
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:58,910
What the fuck?

1198
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,450
Wait, let me put some music on in the background.

1199
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:04,330
While we, instead of like this omnis...

1200
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:06,010
sound.

1201
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:07,550
Let's have some music.

1202
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:12,590
That makes it better.

1203
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:13,590
Makes it even better.

1204
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:18,590
Allegorically since I missed the beginning.

1205
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,830
Yeah, we're... ooh.

1206
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:24,490
Some chill song in the background.

1207
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:26,190
Leave it as it is.

1208
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,560
This is like Persona 5 music in the background.

1209
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,580
While I was like...

1210
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,380
Dark Wolf 9.

1211
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,780
Someone put their fucking Dark Wolf 9.

1212
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,180
Doki Baby got wrinkle and brain out.

1213
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:52,880
Next try wrinkle.

1214
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:53,740
Earn.

1215
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,800
Every game I finish, I earn more wrinkles in my brain.

1216
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,340
Every game I finish, I earn more wrinkles in my brain.

1217
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,360
Certainly, I have two wrinkles.

1218
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,760
I have finished two games.

1219
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,200
But without Teddy, we'll be one forever.

1220
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,920
Just to be smoothed out 20 minutes later.

1221
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,520
The real Teddy was a wrinkle we made all along.

1222
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:27,320
I honestly did not think the game was gonna... we were gonna...

1223
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,260
We were gonna finish this game so quickly.

1224
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,040
How long did that take us actually?

1225
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,040
Oh shit, wait that took us an hour.

1226
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:34,840
Wait...

1227
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,300
That was an hour of gameplay, holy shit.

1228
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,640
I felt like... wait sorry I mean 10 minutes.

1229
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,040
Sorry, I meant that took me 10 minutes.

1230
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:44,480
Damn.

1231
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,860
Like so many Daniels.

1232
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:52,860
Why are we still at the... how long is this credit?

1233
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,040
How long is this credit?

1234
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,440
Cause we're still... oh now we're at ease.

1235
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,200
Okay we made it to the ease guys.

1236
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,880
Holy shit it's from 8 to... you know what?

1237
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,160
Yeah we don't need to learn about all the Eddies up there.

1238
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,560
Do we have like bonus?

1239
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,380
Playground in the account... Museum?

1240
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:13,780
What's this museum?

1241
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,040
I was thinking that going to all the...

1242
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,500
Finally among us the light in the moon.

1243
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,860
We need to see every name.

1244
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,140
Alright let's look at the museum chat.

1245
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,000
I'm there right now.

1246
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,760
I like how the Persona 5 music is playing in the background.

1247
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,740
Okay what the fuck?

1248
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,920
Where the fuck are... what's... is this ghost Teddy?

1249
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,520
Is he dead?

1250
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,640
Wait did Teddy die?

1251
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,200
What?

1252
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,300
Wait... wait so his arm is gone and he's dead?

1253
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,400
No... take a look around.

1254
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,340
Teddy's a ghost now.

1255
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,300
Wait Teddy actually died.

1256
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,180
What the fuck?

1257
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,800
Teddy is your subcon Teddy ghost.

1258
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,360
This one's awesome.

1259
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,540
The birth of among us...

1260
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:11,980
I just broke...

1261
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,800
Okay no.

1262
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,760
I should have revived...

1263
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,060
Just a case.

1264
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:20,780
Dude Teddy could have been so cute.

1265
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,860
Like this is such a cute version of Teddy.

1266
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,460
Sorry my dog is like looking at my dad and outside.

1267
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,600
Teddy is a sacrifice to peace...

1268
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,460
Uh... the... the blonde guy.

1269
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,380
Yo what... this is so fucking...

1270
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:38,480
Dude okay I... I hate like... I know this is like textured for 3D.

1271
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,120
But this looks so... so...

1272
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,800
Oh gosh Doki no.

1273
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,620
No Doki.

1274
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:45,580
No.

1275
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:46,740
Come on.

1276
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,500
Sorry my dog is...

1277
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,280
Harold...

1278
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:51,960
Harold Hydra.

1279
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,300
Oh god dude fuck this girl.

1280
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,320
Oh so this is the monster.

1281
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,340
Is this a co-monster?

1282
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,980
I don't know dude fuck this bitch though.

1283
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:06,120
Oh we never saw like his top half until... until the end.

1284
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,940
Wait where's the museum?

1285
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,080
I wanna go to the... the gallery.

1286
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,040
The museum gallery.

1287
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,240
Oh here it is.

1288
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:14,760
Here it is.

1289
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,220
Show puppy?

1290
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,760
I have a lot of photos of my dog in the discord.

1291
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:20,420
I mean...

1292
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,320
Oh god.

1293
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,460
There's a prologue?

1294
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,200
You guys wanna...

1295
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,720
Oh should we play the prologue guys?

1296
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,520
You guys wanna play the prologue?

1297
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,060
Like... we could play it.

1298
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,520
Oh shit yeah I'm so fast.

1299
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,280
What the fuck?

1300
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,260
That's so fast look at that baby.

1301
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,640
Alright well we'll play the prologue after we look at the museum.

1302
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,260
I drew my nightmare once and I look pretty sick.

1303
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,400
It will be in my memories in 70 years of life.

1304
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:59,820
Oh my god, what the fuck?

1305
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,980
I'm gonna turn off the music now.

1306
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,860
Maybe zoom.

1307
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,060
I don't understand why Teddy has to be a goat.

1308
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,780
This is a sign choice.

1309
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,620
This is a sign choice.

1310
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,080
Go on the computer?

1311
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:30,940
Holy shit.

1312
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:34,640
Okay.

1313
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,740
Dude, fuck the playground.

1314
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,080
When was your birds?

1315
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,360
Wait, there were birds in this game?

1316
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,620
What the fuck?

1317
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,720
Wait, there were birds in the game?

1318
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,520
Since when?

1319
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,100
Since when?

1320
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:58,740
What?

1321
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,060
What were there birds in the game?

1322
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:02,600
What the fuck?

1323
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,480
All I remember was owl.

1324
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,020
All I remember was this fuck.

1325
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,500
That's all I remember.

1326
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,740
Okay, so these are all the artwork of the playground.

1327
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:16,580
What is this?

1328
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,140
What was...

1329
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,640
Oh, this is like a... the diagram.

1330
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,060
Patty...

1331
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:21,680
He's laughing.

1332
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:22,740
He kind of says... okay.

1333
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,200
Oh, he was too scared to notice.

1334
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,820
Yeah, I didn't see the fucking bird.

1335
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:36,280
This thumbtack was unwrapped in sea brush.

1336
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,080
Never let's say we're happy.

1337
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:40,300
The house here is a symbol of the family and home falling apart.

1338
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,420
The house here is a symbol of the family and home falling apart.

1339
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:47,720
The bloated creature inhabiting it is how the kid sees his mother when she's drinking and full of sorrow.

1340
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:48,720
Awwww.

1341
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,260
This is like the designs of the house.

1342
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,180
Where's the monsters?

1343
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,220
Oh, this is the...

1344
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,240
Teddy, where are you?

1345
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,480
How am I supposed to learn shit without Teddy here?

1346
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:06,440
Wait, what?

1347
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:09,840
What's this?

1348
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,920
Oh, this is the exit.

1349
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:13,980
I was like, what is this?

1350
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,520
Where's Teddy?

1351
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,660
How am I supposed to learn anything?

1352
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,380
There's the monsters.

1353
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,220
Oh, God.

1354
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,080
Oh, God.

1355
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,300
What the...

1356
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,720
Who's this?

1357
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,140
What?

1358
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,820
Who's this?

1359
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:44,320
What the fuck?

1360
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,160
What?

1361
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:46,420
What?

1362
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,020
Wait, what's this here?

1363
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:51,500
What?

1364
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,600
We go back.

1365
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:55,940
We grab the airplane.

1366
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:57,600
And he look like...

1367
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,600
Wait, did he look like that?

1368
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,300
What the...

1369
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:01,580
What?

1370
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,740
Yeah, fuck Teddy, dude.

1371
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,900
Holy shit!

1372
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:10,080
Okay, wait.

1373
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:10,940
Now this is...

1374
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:16,880
The story of how the game ended was very different in the early days of production.

1375
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,120
Back then, Teddy was antagonist of the game.

1376
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:19,320
Oh!

1377
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,420
Actually, kind of silly what I drew.

1378
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,360
We don't need Teddy this whole time.

1379
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,320
The lore is so well thought out.

1380
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,240
Yeah, the lore is very interesting.

1381
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:38,460
Um, and an evil entity, a monster disguised as a friendly teddy bear took advantage of this by taking the child into a dangerous adventure far away from home.

1382
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:39,860
Um...

1383
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:41,440
Oh, so okay.

1384
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,260
So it was like that.

1385
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,680
Oh god, why did they have to give him black eyes?

1386
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:51,740
Like...

1387
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,920
The black eyes is so unselfish.

1388
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:56,400
Who's this?

1389
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,300
Who the fuck is this guy?

1390
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,100
I know these three.

1391
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,180
Or two.

1392
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,120
Who is he?

1393
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,440
I don't remember shit.

1394
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:07,380
Harold?

1395
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:08,720
Harold, who are you?

1396
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,860
I remember him.

1397
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,060
And her.

1398
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:12,920
Oh god, dude.

1399
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,020
Did I hate you?

1400
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:15,420
Holy shit.

1401
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,160
Oh god, I don't want to look at her anymore.

1402
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,460
You completely missed him.

1403
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,520
Yeah, I've never seen him.

1404
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,480
Where's mom?

1405
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,160
And there's all the plushies.

1406
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:33,200
What are these?

1407
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:33,960
Sleep?

1408
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,020
What are you?

1409
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,720
There's our very early projections.

1410
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:43,000
There wasn't a sudden decision to cut these.

1411
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:43,940
Oh, they're like...

1412
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:44,200
Oh, they're like...

1413
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,680
They're all the cut creatures that were supposed to be in this game.

1414
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:49,380
What?

1415
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:51,620
What's this?

1416
01:00:55,830 --> 01:01:00,290
I'm guessing he's a monster in the playground stage, but we never met him because of the gun plays.

1417
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,910
Yeah, is that... Oh my god!

1418
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:05,590
What the fuck is...

1419
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:06,910
Excuse me?

1420
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:12,810
What the fuck?

1421
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:16,910
Okay, I'm getting out of here.

1422
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:17,690
What the fuck?

1423
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:18,330
What the fuck was that?

1424
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:22,750
Okay, like...

1425
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:25,530
Oh god, I'm sorry.

1426
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:26,310
I'm sorry.

1427
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:28,790
What's over here?

1428
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:29,830
What?

1429
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:36,350
Alright, Teddy goes top.

1430
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,410
Oh, okay.

1431
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:51,850
Wait, okay, look over here.

1432
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:53,490
What are you gonna say?

1433
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,350
Ah, my favorite place.

1434
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:59,630
I felt we really connected here, you know?

1435
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:05,290
A bit of a breather between the various bad, nightmarish worlds we went to.

1436
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:12,710
Also, I was able to talk a lot here, as elsewhere the developers were concerned about keeping the tension up.

1437
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,310
And didn't want me to sleep.

1438
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:15,350
It's literally me screaming now.

1439
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:16,170
How scary...

1440
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:18,830
Also, I kinda get quiet when scared.

1441
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:19,930
So...

1442
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:21,270
I'm okay and all.

1443
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:24,530
But I liked best the times we had to catch up.

1444
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:26,110
Where's this area?

1445
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:27,110
Can you talk to me?

1446
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:29,810
Originally, the chase for the mom was a MacGuffin.

1447
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,930
You did not really find her.

1448
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:36,490
And the monsters used her to lure you further into the dreamlands.

1449
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:40,270
And we struggled for some time to make sense of this story.

1450
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:46,050
Especially the playtesters were confused as the story ended without you seeing your mom again.

1451
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:48,350
How do I even get out of here?

1452
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:52,910
Proceed to see the old ending of Among the Sleep?

1453
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:54,090
Oh shit.

1454
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:58,250
What is the old ending?

1455
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:20,610
Oh, is this where he becomes like an evil guy?

1456
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:22,710
Okay.

1457
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,680
Oh god, this is the original ending.

1458
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,540
Oh god.

1459
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:35,920
What is this?

1460
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,100
Can I move?

1461
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:46,480
Oh, I can move!

1462
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,580
Oh, okay, but that's it.

1463
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:50,820
I can't do shit.

1464
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,420
Okay, there's Teddy.

1465
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,360
There's evil Teddy.

1466
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,820
Tastes like sneak fear!

1467
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:08,760
Oh, is he gonna... oh, he's gonna cook me.

1468
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:15,810
Oh, there's... hey, Teddy.

1469
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:17,790
Hey, Teddy.

1470
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:22,090
Teddy.

1471
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:24,190
Where did you go, Teddy?

1472
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:25,850
Where did you go?

1473
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:27,810
Teddy?

1474
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:33,670
Teddy?

1475
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,900
Oh, what do I do?

1476
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:43,420
Oh, oh god, Teddy.

1477
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,380
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1478
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,480
What the fuck?

1479
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:50,740
Hello?

1480
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:54,100
Hello?

1481
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:55,220
Hello?

1482
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,200
Oh!

1483
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:16,050
Oh god, oh, it's him!

1484
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:18,110
Oh, god!

1485
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:20,070
Oh, god!

1486
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:21,910
I hate this!

1487
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:25,070
Bring me back!

1488
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:26,050
Bring me back!

1489
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:30,810
I'm so sorry!

1490
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:32,030
Please!

1491
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:44,490
Well, guys...

1492
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:45,590
Well...

1493
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,300
Okay, yeah...

1494
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,120
Uh, uh...

1495
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:56,260
Uh...

1496
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:57,900
That's it.

1497
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,820
Okay, the longer I stare at him, the less scary he gets, not gonna lie.

1498
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:06,840
Uh, you know what he reminds me of?

1499
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:10,360
He reminds me of the... the SpongeBob grandma from the chocolate episode.

1500
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:11,640
Like...

1501
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,960
Yeah, you're like...

1502
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,420
Yeah, you're like the grandma in the SpongeBob...

1503
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:19,020
Let's see...

1504
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:19,620
Yeah...

1505
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:24,780
The more I look at him, the more I realize...

1506
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,620
You know, it's not that scary.

1507
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:26,300
The more I...

1508
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:27,480
Chocolate!

1509
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,300
I smell the dreams of lime trees...

1510
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,940
And then some chocolate.

1511
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,080
But I...

1512
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,760
But I'll keep up with this.

1513
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,300
This guy...

1514
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,460
This guy watched SpongeBob, that's for sure.

1515
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,300
He's coming as I am...

1516
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,640
And he's singing us a song before he eats us.

1517
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:49,680
Isn't that sweet?

1518
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,720
Lime trees, and the sand is there...

1519
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:06,060
Thank you.

1520
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:07,900
You did very well.

1521
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:09,600
I will enjoy it.

1522
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,640
Please just eat me, dude.

1523
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:10,900
I'm okay.

1524
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,520
Oh, God.

1525
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:16,720
Very thoughtful of him.

1526
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:21,500
Very thoughtful of him for him to sing us a lullaby before he fucking goes home with us.

1527
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,980
I'll work just so I can still love it.

1528
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:28,500
Bye-bye.

1529
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,420
Bye-bye.

1530
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:44,160
Sing me a lullaby before you eat me.

1531
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,400
Kind of...

1532
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,460
Yeah, how do you put...

1533
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,020
Did you just chuck us into the can?

1534
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:49,760
But he was like...

1535
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:53,940
He's like, I'm gonna make it...

1536
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,420
I'm gonna make it less painful.

1537
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:59,540
I see no point why we would eat a baby unless a baby had some...

1538
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:00,340
I mean...

1539
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:01,820
I mean, you eat baby...

1540
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:04,740
Some people eat baby chickens and baby deer.

1541
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,100
It's like saying, why would you eat a baby?

1542
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:18,720
What is...

1543
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,260
I mean, early horror games were more on jump scares, right?

1544
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,280
Yeah, I like the...

1545
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:22,740
I don't know.

1546
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:23,680
Oh, there's lore here.

1547
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,360
It's very interesting.

1548
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,720
Alright, let's play the prologue, guys.

1549
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,080
How long is the prologue?

1550
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,640
I hope it's not super long.

1551
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,100
Can I just fall in?

1552
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,780
Oh no, I don't die.

1553
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:40,940
How do I get out?

1554
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:49,580
Ooh, fast baby.

1555
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:50,100
You know what?

1556
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,360
Oh, this is how you get out.

1557
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:55,960
I was like, how do I get out?

1558
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,400
Alright, let's try the prologue, guys.

1559
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:02,920
Um...

1560
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:04,240
Alright.

1561
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:09,900
I'm gonna see how long... I'm gonna look up how long the prologue is, guys, before we play it.

1562
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:14,540
How long it is among the sleep prologue.

1563
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:18,080
Just so... just so I know.

1564
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:19,680
Alright.

1565
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:21,260
Um, complete.

1566
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:22,300
Okay, 15 minutes.

1567
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:23,440
So that's like one hour.

1568
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:26,760
I mean, no, we're gonna speak... so that's like five minutes for me.

1569
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,760
If it takes 15 minutes to complete it, it's practically...

1570
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,300
five minutes for me.

1571
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:33,600
Easy.

1572
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:35,480
We got this.

1573
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:36,920
Five minute speedrun.

1574
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:37,720
Let's fucking go.

1575
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,960
You're probably... yeah, exactly.

1576
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,740
Probably clear in five minutes, chat.

1577
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:50,730
Why am I in the fucking... why the fuck did they put the baby in the snow?

1578
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:52,870
Baby, why are you in snow?

1579
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,040
Who the fuck left the baby in the snow?

1580
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:07,600
What the fuck?

1581
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:12,740
Oh, god, what?

1582
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:27,520
Teddy?

1583
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:28,420
Where's Teddy?

1584
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,340
Oh, it's a prologue.

1585
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,460
I haven't had my birthday yet.

1586
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:39,500
I haven't had my birthday.

1587
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:40,980
Cold.

1588
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:43,140
So... so cold.

1589
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,140
Who?

1590
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,520
Who said that?

1591
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,340
Who said that?

1592
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,300
That's not me.

1593
01:10:58,140 --> 01:10:59,040
Baby can't be.

1594
01:10:59,060 --> 01:10:59,900
Baby can't talk.

1595
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:00,880
Oh!

1596
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:03,660
Hey there.

1597
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:07,080
What did I do?

1598
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:09,440
Hello?

1599
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,240
Oh, hello?

1600
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:16,100
What the fuck do you want me to do?

1601
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:18,600
I'm gonna leave you.

1602
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:22,360
Oh, wait, I was gonna... I thought I had to open that and leave.

1603
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,220
I was gonna...

1604
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:24,480
What?

1605
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:24,960
What?

1606
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,280
I thought... I didn't think it was cool.

1607
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:28,560
I thought I was gonna go outside.

1608
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,820
I was gonna go leave you.

1609
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:41,150
Alright.

1610
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:45,930
Hey, Renner.

1611
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:48,490
What do you want?

1612
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:52,330
Oh, oh.

1613
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:53,730
Save.

1614
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:56,010
Thank you.

1615
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:59,090
Monsters don't like happiness.

1616
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:00,750
Monsters don't like happiness.

1617
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:04,650
Yeah, fuck happiness, dude.

1618
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:04,730
Dude!

1619
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:08,950
Warm,

1620
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:16,910
good, cold bath.

1621
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:20,410
I haven't seen press the teddy button.

1622
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:21,010
Nothing.

1623
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:22,970
I can't do anything with the teddy button.

1624
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:26,430
Can I open the door?

1625
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:28,590
Oh I can.

1626
01:12:28,690 --> 01:12:29,830
I have to go up.

1627
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:30,370
Maybe up.

1628
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:36,710
Why is it dark?

1629
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:46,210
Hello?

1630
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:49,310
Oh!

1631
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:49,990
Oh!

1632
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:50,530
Wait!

1633
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:51,570
Why are you back?

1634
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:54,510
Can't see me.

1635
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:55,490
Can't see me.

1636
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:57,090
We don't need teddy.

1637
01:12:58,030 --> 01:12:59,470
Mom can't see me.

1638
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,620
I'll just go this way.

1639
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:11,880
I'll just go this way.

1640
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,300
Oh gosh.

1641
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,100
Step by step, thank you so much for the follow.

1642
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:22,580
Thank you, thank you.

1643
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,220
I really do appreciate it.

1644
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:25,420
Have a...

1645
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:26,960
Have a butthurt.

1646
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,240
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1647
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:29,920
Where the fuck do I...

1648
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,040
Is this another maze?

1649
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:31,900
Please.

1650
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,080
Not another maze.

1651
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:35,700
Oh!

1652
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:36,180
Lore!

1653
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,820
Thank you, LF.

1654
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:43,440
Lore!

1655
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,040
Oh god.

1656
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,400
Thank you so much for the follow.

1657
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,420
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1658
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:49,380
Have a butthurt.

1659
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:50,380
Thank you so much.

1660
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,780
How many plushies do I have?

1661
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,060
Okay, but...

1662
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:09,660
Where are these plushies?

1663
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:12,560
Please don't make me try and find them.

1664
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:13,580
Please don't...

1665
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:15,600
Please don't give me a maze.

1666
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,100
Do do do.

1667
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,680
I'm okay.

1668
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,100
Gotta find them.

1669
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:25,760
Smile.

1670
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,100
Do do do.

1671
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:30,760
Ah!

1672
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,600
Oh, baby.

1673
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:37,960
Hey, mom.

1674
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:39,760
Hey there.

1675
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:41,820
Oh, mom gone.

1676
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:42,760
Please.

1677
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:43,580
Mom gone.

1678
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:48,580
Please.

1679
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,060
Okay, what do you mean?

1680
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:52,860
What do you mean?

1681
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,560
How do I even get up?

1682
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,780
How do I even get up?

1683
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:57,780
Oh, up.

1684
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,060
That's how.

1685
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:03,920
That's how I get up.

1686
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,400
Wait, how do I get up from here?

1687
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:16,530
Oh, I don't need to get up, right?

1688
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:18,130
Okay.

1689
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:20,310
Ugh.

1690
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:21,770
Ugh.

1691
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:23,690
Excuse me.

1692
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,550
Excuse me, county sir.

1693
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:27,210
How do I close a window?

1694
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:29,210
How...

1695
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:31,810
I don't know how to do a lot of things, apparently.

1696
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:33,310
I'm a very dumb baby.

1697
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:34,850
I'm so sorry, man.

1698
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:36,070
I'm so sorry.

1699
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:36,570
I'm very dumb.

1700
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:40,610
I don't know how to close windows.

1701
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:42,670
I don't know how to close windows.

1702
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:50,670
Wait, can I move chair?

1703
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:53,170
Oh, I can move the chairs.

1704
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:55,690
Look.

1705
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:56,750
I died.

1706
01:15:56,810 --> 01:15:57,330
I'm a very dumb.

1707
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:58,090
Oh, shit.

1708
01:15:58,150 --> 01:15:58,950
I'm a very dumb baby.

1709
01:15:59,010 --> 01:15:59,650
I'm so sorry.

1710
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:00,590
I'm so sorry.

1711
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:06,130
Okay, happiness.

1712
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:07,370
What makes you happy?

1713
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:08,930
Happy, please.

1714
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,210
What makes you happy?

1715
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:10,850
I don't know what makes me happy.

1716
01:16:11,730 --> 01:16:12,650
I don't know what makes me happy.

1717
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:13,230
What makes you happy?

1718
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:15,410
What makes you happy?

1719
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:17,330
See?

1720
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:18,350
Knife?

1721
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:21,470
Okay.

1722
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:23,270
Definitely not the knife.

1723
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:23,810
I don't...

1724
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:31,420
Ball.

1725
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,100
Oh, that is not a ball.

1726
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:34,820
Oh, God.

1727
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:35,900
Wait, I fucked up.

1728
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:38,880
I don't think I was supposed to pick that up, guys.

1729
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:40,880
I don't think I was supposed to pick that up, guys.

1730
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,680
I don't think I was supposed to pick that up.

1731
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,620
I don't think I was supposed to pick that up.

1732
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:49,720
I don't think I was supposed to pick that up, guys.

1733
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:50,220
I caused my own.

1734
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:52,620
I actually caused my own.

1735
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,020
I actually caused my own.

1736
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,840
I almost fucked myself over.

1737
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:59,420
I almost fucked myself over.

1738
01:16:59,840 --> 01:16:59,880
I almost fucked myself over.

1739
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,040
I almost fucked myself over.

1740
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,680
Okay, so what I learned...

1741
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,720
was that I was not that.

1742
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:07,720
What makes you happy?

1743
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:08,300
What makes you happy?

1744
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,240
Oh, maybe?

1745
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,340
Does this make me happy?

1746
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:21,640
Does this make me happy?

1747
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:28,160
Okay.

1748
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:30,540
Okay, where the fuck is your shit that makes you happy?

1749
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:32,820
Okay, where the fuck is your shit that makes you happy?

1750
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:36,060
Okay.

1751
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:36,600
Okay.

1752
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:37,760
Where are you?

1753
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:39,500
What makes you happy?

1754
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:41,300
What makes you happy?

1755
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:47,010
Okay, well...

1756
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:49,310
What makes you happy, mister?

1757
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:50,070
What makes you happy, mister?

1758
01:17:50,890 --> 01:17:51,830
Make happy.

1759
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:52,830
Make happy.

1760
01:17:58,500 --> 01:17:59,740
I'm trying to figure this shit.

1761
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:01,320
Dude, my brain is so tiny right now.

1762
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,360
I don't know what the fuck would make this guy happy.

1763
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,280
What makes you happy?

1764
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:11,580
What makes you happy?

1765
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:13,660
That does not make happy.

1766
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:21,270
Okay.

1767
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:22,890
Okay, but...

1768
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:23,910
What?

1769
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:27,410
Was I supposed to bring the music box?

1770
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:33,880
What makes him happy?

1771
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:34,380
What makes him happy?

1772
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:34,920
Okay, let me go back.

1773
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,360
There has to be some happy things here.

1774
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:41,840
Oh, wait.

1775
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:42,320
The fridge?

1776
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:45,120
Is there happy things in here?

1777
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,240
Is there

1778
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:50,820
happy things in here?

1779
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,400
Okay, nothing in here looks happy.

1780
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:54,460
Okay, nothing in here looks happy.

1781
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:56,080
What if we turn on the sto- Oh, true!

1782
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,060
Okay, no, you cannot turn on the stove.

1783
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:01,360
There is nothing there where I can turn.

1784
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,940
Dude, what the fuck makes you happy?

1785
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:05,840
Dude, what the fuck makes you happy?

1786
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,180
You're not helpful at all, mister.

1787
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,600
I don't know what makes you happy.

1788
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,040
Does milk make you happy?

1789
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:14,280
Ooh, is it milk?

1790
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,280
No, I can't pick it up.

1791
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:16,620
Oh, I can.

1792
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,740
Does milk make you happy, mister?

1793
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,040
Mister?

1794
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:24,360
Does milk make you happy?

1795
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:28,720
Have some milk.

1796
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,500
Okay, I don't think he wants milk.

1797
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:35,780
How the fuck did this person finish this in 15 minutes?

1798
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:37,960
It was not milk.

1799
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,300
It was not milk.

1800
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:40,580
It was not milk.

1801
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:47,290
What makes you happy?

1802
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:51,450
What makes you happy?

1803
01:19:51,450 --> 01:19:51,670
Dude...

1804
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:55,470
What makes you happy?

1805
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:01,730
What was that?

1806
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:05,790
What was that?

1807
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:07,330
I'm so sorry.

1808
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,430
I'm so sorry.

1809
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:10,750
Oh...

1810
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:13,810
How do I make you happy?

1811
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:18,430
You're fantastic.

1812
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:20,430
I'm doing...

1813
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:24,790
How do you make happy?

1814
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:27,110
I've been stuck here trying to...

1815
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:31,450
Oh shit.

1816
01:20:31,490 --> 01:20:32,350
Wait, play?

1817
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:34,330
Let's play make happy.

1818
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:38,310
Play.

1819
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:40,390
Oh, gosh.

1820
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:41,370
Oh, baby.

1821
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:42,590
Thank you so much.

1822
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:43,270
That'll follow.

1823
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:43,790
Oh, shit.

1824
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:44,430
Thank you.

1825
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:44,750
Thank you.

1826
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:45,570
I got play.

1827
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:47,510
Does play make happy?

1828
01:20:48,830 --> 01:20:49,230
Oh.

1829
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:51,970
Oh, okay.

1830
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:52,590
It's not playing.

1831
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:54,050
We don't know how to make happy.

1832
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:57,070
I need to think here.

1833
01:20:57,130 --> 01:20:58,010
What makes you...

1834
01:20:59,170 --> 01:21:00,790
Okay, we're like stuck in this one level.

1835
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:02,830
Because we don't know how the fuck we make happy.

1836
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:04,730
We don't know how to make...

1837
01:21:04,730 --> 01:21:06,710
We're gonna be stuck here forever.

1838
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:09,350
We don't know how to make happy.

1839
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:18,440
Oh, God.

1840
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,000
Oh, God.

1841
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:20,500
Monster.

1842
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,600
Oh, God.

1843
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:22,900
I'm so sorry.

1844
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:23,680
Let me hide.

1845
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:25,380
Audible.

1846
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,080
Someone drew the tier one.

1847
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:29,680
Sixteen months.

1848
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:30,980
Thank you.

1849
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:31,580
Thank you.

1850
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,720
It's a great night deal quick for Audible.

1851
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:36,840
Do I have to go back?

1852
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,500
Oh, my gosh.

1853
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:40,700
I'm so sorry.

1854
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:42,900
I

1855
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:47,470
don't know how to make happy.

1856
01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:48,750
Wait.

1857
01:21:52,670 --> 01:21:53,490
Climb up?

1858
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:54,930
Where's happy here?

1859
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:56,050
Happy?

1860
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:00,970
Anything happy here?

1861
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:03,350
Any happy times?

1862
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:05,130
Okay, that's no happy time.

1863
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:07,570
Banana?

1864
01:22:11,290 --> 01:22:12,430
Find happy.

1865
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:13,890
What makes happy?

1866
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:15,210
I don't know.

1867
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:21,510
I've been trying to figure out happy for so long.

1868
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:26,190
I'm so...

1869
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:26,890
I'm so...

1870
01:22:26,890 --> 01:22:27,010
I'm so...

1871
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:27,050
Please.

1872
01:22:27,330 --> 01:22:27,750
Please.

1873
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:29,810
Where do I hide?

1874
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:34,110
This

1875
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:39,780
makes me happy.

1876
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,580
This makes me happy.

1877
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:45,240
This

1878
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:48,830
makes me happy.

1879
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:49,230
Okay.

1880
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:54,150
Come

1881
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,040
on.

1882
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:03,820
I'm so happy.

1883
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:06,120
I'm so happy.

1884
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:06,680
Remote makes you happy!

1885
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:08,380
Okay!

1886
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,120
Remote?

1887
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:18,100
Huh?

1888
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:19,840
Remote makes happy?

1889
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,280
Oh!

1890
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,080
Remote makes happy!

1891
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,420
Thank you!

1892
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,000
Are you seeing?

1893
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:36,870
Okay, remote makes happy.

1894
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:39,530
Okay, then where the fuck...

1895
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:42,610
This is a good memory.

1896
01:23:46,010 --> 01:23:46,570
Oh!

1897
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,920
This is supposed to be a happy place!

1898
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:59,120
What the fuck?

1899
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:01,960
I thought this was supposed to be a happy place!

1900
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,900
I like this studio.

1901
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:13,400
That did not make me happy.

1902
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:14,920
That was not happy.

1903
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,880
That was not...

1904
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:19,870
What?

1905
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:21,010
What is that?

1906
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:23,130
What?

1907
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,130
Oh, that monster went in.

1908
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:28,150
Oh my god, there is Harold!

1909
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:29,330
Hey Harold!

1910
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:33,210
Can, can...

1911
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:36,150
I guess we are not going back there!

1912
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:43,190
Well, I guess we know we are not going back this way.

1913
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:46,330
Can I go here?

1914
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:51,830
Is he gonna move?

1915
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:01,700
Dude...

1916
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,660
So what makes happy in kitchen then?

1917
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,660
If I do this, will I die?

1918
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:12,920
Oh yeah!

1919
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:13,500
Yeah!

1920
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:14,020
Yeah!

1921
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:14,880
Okay...

1922
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:30,710
What the fuck?

1923
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:33,030
What the fuck?

1924
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,200
What the fuck?

1925
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:38,020
What

1926
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:41,790
the fuck?

1927
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:43,430
Oh my god!

1928
01:25:43,650 --> 01:25:43,990
Please!

1929
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:48,690
Wait, I need to go back and figure out how to make happy again.

1930
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:54,180
I am still trying to figure out how to...

1931
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:54,860
I am gonna go back.

1932
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:58,360
I need to figure out how the fuck do we make this guy happy.

1933
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:02,900
Like, what is it?

1934
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:03,740
What could it be?

1935
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,520
It has to be something here.

1936
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:08,560
Yeah.

1937
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:11,220
Also, Ginger, thank you so much for the follow!

1938
01:26:11,220 --> 01:26:11,940
Thank you, thank you.

1939
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:12,880
I do appreciate it.

1940
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,560
It has to be something in here then.

1941
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:18,000
What makes you happy?

1942
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:19,460
Oh wait!

1943
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,840
Thank you so much for the follow!

1944
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:22,740
Thank you, thank you.

1945
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,660
I have some butt hearts.

1946
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:24,880
We are trying to figure out happiness.

1947
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,160
The secret to happiness right now.

1948
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,100
It was not playing.

1949
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:34,580
I did, I looked at the table.

1950
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:35,400
It wasn't table.

1951
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:37,960
Yo, you still...

1952
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,280
What makes you happy, Bear?

1953
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:41,320
Radio!

1954
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:42,600
It's radio!

1955
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:44,260
That's gotta be it.

1956
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:46,620
Radio.

1957
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:47,960
Radio.

1958
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:50,180
Okay.

1959
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:51,480
How do I get up though?

1960
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:52,840
It's radio!

1961
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,600
It has to be radio!

1962
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,040
Radio equals music!

1963
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:57,980
It's radio!

1964
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:02,560
No, no.

1965
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:03,580
You got a butt heart.

1966
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:04,480
It's even better.

1967
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,700
Cause I can't make a proper heart and it looks like a butt.

1968
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,660
I did it!

1969
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:12,740
It was radio all along!

1970
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:14,700
Now where did the bear go?

1971
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:15,280
Oh, there.

1972
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,100
Oh, the fox go.

1973
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:19,700
There you go.

1974
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:21,220
It was the fox all along.

1975
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,120
I made him happy.

1976
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,060
Alright, we go back to the...

1977
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:30,480
We go...

1978
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:32,640
Okay.

1979
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:34,460
All right.

1980
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,580
All we need is Teddy, right?

1981
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:40,200
I don't like the squeak in me when you grab it.

1982
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:42,220
Sorry, my dog is growling right now.

1983
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:43,600
You're gonna hear my dog growl.

1984
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:54,640
Hey, mom.

1985
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,080
I don't like that.

1986
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:02,660
Sorry.

1987
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:10,180
Please stop making sounds.

1988
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:11,980
Please.

1989
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,620
Please stop making sounds.

1990
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,140
I'm sick.

1991
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:18,500
Where did I go?

1992
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:21,000
Was that just lore?

1993
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,960
Did I not have to go here?

1994
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:24,480
Was it just lore?

1995
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:33,010
Do I go outside?

1996
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:39,530
Well, I'm not gonna go outside anymore.

1997
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:41,310
I'm gonna stay here.

1998
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:42,770
I'm not gonna go outside.

1999
01:28:44,170 --> 01:28:45,750
What the fuck is that sound?

2000
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:46,910
What?

2001
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:48,130
What is that sound?

2002
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:50,430
What is that sound?

2003
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:57,970
Who gives a fuck about the outside?

2004
01:28:58,290 --> 01:28:58,810
Not me.

2005
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:01,870
Okay.

2006
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:02,930
I hate this.

2007
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:07,390
I hate it.

2008
01:29:12,130 --> 01:29:13,150
Let me in.

2009
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:14,410
Let me in.

2010
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:18,630
Let me in.

2011
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:19,990
Oh my god.

2012
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:21,450
Please let me in.

2013
01:29:23,690 --> 01:29:25,610
Harold, I'm sorry.

2014
01:29:26,050 --> 01:29:27,330
I'm sorry, Harold.

2015
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:29,190
Harold, I'm sorry.

2016
01:29:29,470 --> 01:29:30,490
I'm so sorry.

2017
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:36,190
I'm so sorry.

2018
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:40,090
I'm so sorry.

2019
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:41,850
Harold, no.

2020
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:42,770
Harold.

2021
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:49,460
Harold, gone.

2022
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,240
Bye, Harold.

2023
01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:54,860
How do I open this?

2024
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:56,960
Bye, Harold.

2025
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:57,680
Stupid.

2026
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:01,360
Wait.

2027
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,380
I think I'm...

2028
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:04,680
I'm back where I started.

2029
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,340
I'm back where I started.

2030
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,200
Wait, where the fuck did I go?

2031
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:15,860
There's no place to say goodbye before you're leaving.

2032
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:18,840
Well, I finished the game.

2033
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,440
I finished it, guys.

2034
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:28,480
Well, look.

2035
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:29,320
I did it.

2036
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,380
I don't know where to go.

2037
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:44,620
Oh, up?

2038
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:46,240
Oh!

2039
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:54,120
Up!

2040
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:57,260
Baby, go up.

2041
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:57,840
Wait.

2042
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:03,260
Baby dead.

2043
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:03,960
Baby...

2044
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:09,380
Oh, wait.

2045
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:11,720
Baby no.

2046
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:12,560
Go up!

2047
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,540
Apparently, I guess he doesn't know how to do stairs, too.

2048
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:19,620
Thank god.

2049
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,420
At least he doesn't know how to do...

2050
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:22,920
Oh, I get it.

2051
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,000
That computer room.

2052
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:26,500
Remember that computer room earlier?

2053
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,960
But where was the computer room again?

2054
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:32,960
I don't even remember.

2055
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:34,260
I don't...

2056
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:35,480
I'm so lost, guys.

2057
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:37,100
I don't remember where the computer...

2058
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:37,760
Memories!

2059
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:38,740
Happy!

2060
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,200
It's okay, baby.

2061
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:41,080
Happy for now.

2062
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,680
I just need to go to the computer room again.

2063
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:49,200
I need to remember how to get there.

2064
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,140
I think it was like here somewhere.

2065
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:52,400
I think it was like here somewhere.

2066
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:54,960
Yeah, it was like here.

2067
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:57,300
Right?

2068
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:58,480
Yeah.

2069
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,260
This must be where Key is, right?

2070
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,360
This must be where Key is, right?

2071
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:08,800
What?

2072
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:10,780
Where did Baby go?

2073
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:11,480
Where did I go?

2074
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:16,320
Where am I?

2075
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:17,320
Did I break the game?

2076
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:20,080
Did I break the game?

2077
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:20,680
What?

2078
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:26,520
Wait!

2079
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:28,060
Did I break the game?

2080
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:30,700
Excuse me?

2081
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:33,760
Wait.

2082
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:34,960
Wait, wait, wait.

2083
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:37,340
Wait, what?

2084
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:39,500
I think I broke the game.

2085
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,280
Where am I?

2086
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:44,280
Damn.

2087
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:46,640
I broke the game.

2088
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,880
How did I break the game?

2089
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:53,300
I just climbed up a chair.

2090
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:56,300
All I did was...

2091
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:57,660
I climbed up the chair.

2092
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,960
And then I broke the game.

2093
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,900
Because I can't climb chairs, too.

2094
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:02,800
Okay.

2095
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,180
I don't want to restart it, guys.

2096
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:11,020
It was the wrong chair.

2097
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,580
Okay, load from last checkpoint.

2098
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:15,640
Let's see where it takes me.

2099
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:21,520
Okay, happy times.

2100
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:22,420
Woo!

2101
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:24,700
Back in the kitchen.

2102
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:28,860
Back in the kitchen I go.

2103
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:33,360
Back in the kitchen I go.

2104
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:34,760
Alright, lore.

2105
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:35,820
Woo!

2106
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:36,700
Lore.

2107
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:43,400
Woo!

2108
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:44,860
Back in here we go.

2109
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:46,640
Yeah!

2110
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:47,300
Lore.

2111
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:50,400
Hey, Cryptic.

2112
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:54,980
Oh, god!

2113
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:55,680
I'm so sorry.

2114
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:55,980
Oh!

2115
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,020
Harold.

2116
01:33:59,020 --> 01:33:59,860
Bye, Harold.

2117
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:01,520
Bye.

2118
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:12,820
Please open the door.

2119
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:14,280
Open the door, lady.

2120
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:15,040
Alright, back.

2121
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:17,600
Alright, let's get on the chair again.

2122
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:22,780
Oh my god, Gumi!

2123
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:24,660
Oh my god, Gumi.

2124
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:25,960
Thank you so much for the host.

2125
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:28,220
I don't...

2126
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:29,480
I don't...

2127
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:31,140
Gumi!

2128
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:32,820
Gumi, thank you for the host, Gumi!

2129
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:34,180
Were you streaming earlier?

2130
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:38,180
Gumi!

2131
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:41,340
I hope you had a good Gumi Mod Center.

2132
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:42,000
I cried.

2133
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:44,100
Hello, everyone!

2134
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:45,620
Hey, Reaper.

2135
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:47,200
Hello, thank you so much for the follow.

2136
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:48,080
Have a good Bloodheart.

2137
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:49,500
Okay, um...

2138
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:52,340
Okay, where's the key?

2139
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,000
Where's the key?

2140
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:56,280
Key, where you at?

2141
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,000
Hello, everyone!

2142
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,540
From Gumi's stream.

2143
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:02,320
Hello, hello, hello.

2144
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,620
You're streaming no game.

2145
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:06,600
Wait, what?

2146
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:08,200
Was Gumi's stream...

2147
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:10,060
Thank you so much for the follow, Hannah.

2148
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:11,140
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2149
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:12,000
She fell asleep!

2150
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:15,100
Thank you so much, Applebutter.

2151
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:16,560
Hello, everyone from Gumi's stream.

2152
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:17,160
I am...

2153
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:22,000
I am trying to...

2154
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,600
What was she...

2155
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,600
She fell asleep.

2156
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:27,780
Did she pass out?

2157
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,760
What was she streaming?

2158
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:39,100
I'm trying to figure out where the fuck the key is.

2159
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:40,200
Just so... I am baby.

2160
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,340
I am... I am fucking baby right now.

2161
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,340
I don't know what...

2162
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:46,940
I don't know...

2163
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:49,240
I don't know where to go.

2164
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:50,420
Look, there's a plane ticket.

2165
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:55,060
I'm a baby on a fucking desk right now.

2166
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:57,720
I'm stuck on this one level.

2167
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:01,520
Baby doesn't know where to go, guys.

2168
01:36:02,260 --> 01:36:02,700
Baby doesn't know where to go, guys.

2169
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:04,340
Check the drawers.

2170
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:05,820
The drawers are like climbing things.

2171
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,160
They're not like...

2172
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,260
There's nothing in the drawers.

2173
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:11,520
They're only used for... to climb.

2174
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:16,740
I would know because I've climbed many, many drawers.

2175
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,560
Thank you so much for the follow and sad boy.

2176
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:21,360
Thank you, thank you.

2177
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:22,680
Applebutter.

2178
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,060
I hope you guys enjoyed Gumi's stream.

2179
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,780
I hope you guys enjoyed her streams.

2180
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:28,540
I was watching both streams until Gumi fell...

2181
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:30,780
Did she like... was she playing in the middle of Among Us?

2182
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:32,600
And then she fell asleep?

2183
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:35,100
Right in the middle of the game?

2184
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:39,980
Oh my god.

2185
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:40,660
That's like...

2186
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,420
Oh my god.

2187
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:44,940
Gumi.

2188
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:48,440
Oh, that's pretty funny.

2189
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:49,640
That's pretty funny.

2190
01:36:53,950 --> 01:36:56,110
I got a baby and I'm stuck on the...

2191
01:36:56,110 --> 01:36:58,010
Dude, I wanna be back.

2192
01:36:58,110 --> 01:36:59,770
I wanna be back in the...

2193
01:36:59,770 --> 01:37:01,190
I don't know where to go, guys.

2194
01:37:02,630 --> 01:37:04,310
Where do they want me to go?

2195
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:05,470
I'm just a fucking baby.

2196
01:37:07,150 --> 01:37:07,590
Wait...

2197
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:08,890
Where's Harold?

2198
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:11,350
Hey, Zero.

2199
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:12,570
She didn't fall asleep.

2200
01:37:12,610 --> 01:37:17,610
She just laid back and started watching Undertale Dog on her phone and forgot about the game.

2201
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:18,970
Oh my god.

2202
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:22,230
That's hilarious.

2203
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:23,710
That's actually pretty funny.

2204
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:27,410
I'm like stuck on this level because I have no idea where to go.

2205
01:37:28,870 --> 01:37:30,750
I don't know where the fuck to find the key.

2206
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:32,610
I don't know where the fuck to find the key.

2207
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:33,790
Yeah, we hit our...

2208
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:38,250
I'm gonna be back here until Harold passed me by.

2209
01:37:41,290 --> 01:37:43,710
Um... Hey, maybe Harold knows where the key is.

2210
01:37:45,290 --> 01:37:47,030
Let me go ask Harold real quick.

2211
01:37:49,350 --> 01:37:49,870
Okay.

2212
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:50,650
Chat.

2213
01:37:52,130 --> 01:37:54,410
Alright, who wants a backseat game for me right now?

2214
01:37:55,730 --> 01:37:56,770
Any backseaters?

2215
01:37:57,050 --> 01:37:57,570
Chat?

2216
01:37:58,570 --> 01:37:59,930
I have no shame.

2217
01:38:00,590 --> 01:38:03,590
Any backseaters wanna come in and help me right now?

2218
01:38:09,370 --> 01:38:09,770
Please.

2219
01:38:10,090 --> 01:38:10,490
Please.

2220
01:38:11,570 --> 01:38:12,870
This is my one time.

2221
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:15,090
I will allow backseat gaming.

2222
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:23,430
Harold?

2223
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:28,310
Paul, thank you so much for the follow.

2224
01:38:28,390 --> 01:38:29,350
I do appreciate it.

2225
01:38:29,410 --> 01:38:31,090
Have a... have a blood heart.

2226
01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:31,550
Thank you.

2227
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:31,930
Thank you.

2228
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:33,150
Are we supposed to go upstairs?

2229
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:35,070
No, I... I need a key though.

2230
01:38:35,330 --> 01:38:36,770
I need a key to go upstairs.

2231
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:38,250
I don't know where the key is.

2232
01:38:38,470 --> 01:38:39,150
Oh, wait.

2233
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:40,630
Harold, I'm sorry, Harold.

2234
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:41,370
Bye, Harold.

2235
01:38:42,070 --> 01:38:42,870
Hey, Harold.

2236
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:48,070
Please, I'm stupid, Chat.

2237
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:50,050
Please, you know I'm stupid.

2238
01:38:53,770 --> 01:38:55,570
Chat, you know I'm stupid.

2239
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:59,490
Harold, do you know where the key is?

2240
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:01,770
Thank you so much for the follow.

2241
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:03,850
Hello, Vane, Origen, and Yen.

2242
01:39:03,890 --> 01:39:04,670
Thank you, thank you.

2243
01:39:04,710 --> 01:39:05,750
I do appreciate it.

2244
01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:06,790
Have a whole blood heart.

2245
01:39:06,970 --> 01:39:07,930
Thank you so much.

2246
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:10,370
Hello, Fox.

2247
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:11,370
Welcome, welcome.

2248
01:39:12,090 --> 01:39:12,770
Thanks, Harold.

2249
01:39:13,090 --> 01:39:14,450
Harold doesn't know, I guess.

2250
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:17,030
I'm stupid.

2251
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:18,050
Chat, I'm stupid.

2252
01:39:18,230 --> 01:39:19,650
I need all the help I can get.

2253
01:39:20,530 --> 01:39:21,950
I'm so stupid.

2254
01:39:22,030 --> 01:39:22,590
I'm sorry.

2255
01:39:26,090 --> 01:39:27,070
Harold doesn't know.

2256
01:39:27,190 --> 01:39:28,010
I don't know.

2257
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:33,770
I've been stuck in this level for 20 years.

2258
01:39:37,570 --> 01:39:38,550
Hey, I'm back here.

2259
01:39:39,130 --> 01:39:39,950

Okay, Chat.

2266
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:50,850
So, I guess we just live here.

2267
01:39:51,070 --> 01:39:52,190
I guess we just live here.

2268
01:39:52,270 --> 01:39:52,530
Oh my god.

2269
01:39:52,710 --> 01:39:54,270
Okay, what happened to this chair?

2270
01:39:54,490 --> 01:39:55,550
How did I fuck up the chair?

2271
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:56,830
How did I break the chair?

2272
01:40:02,710 --> 01:40:03,550
Okay, maybe.

2273
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:09,250

01:40:12,690 --> 01:40:13,250
Thank you, everyone.

2278
01:40:13,450 --> 01:40:18,230
So, yeah, I've been stuck in this particular level for 20 years.

2279
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:20,530
Because I have no idea where the key is.

2280
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:21,750
Well...

2281
01:40:22,930 --> 01:40:23,330
Okay.

2282
01:40:23,970 --> 01:40:24,710
That's outside.

2283
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:29,670
Wait, wait.

2284
01:40:29,730 --> 01:40:30,390
Is the key up here?

2285
01:40:30,810 --> 01:40:31,750
Oh my god.

2286
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:33,030
Is the key up here?

2287
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:34,670
Oh my god.

2288
01:40:37,850 --> 01:40:39,430
Okay, there's no... no, it's not.

2289
01:40:39,630 --> 01:40:41,790
I thought it was so fucking smart.

2290
01:40:42,090 --> 01:40:44,670
I honestly thought it was so fucking smart.

2291
01:40:44,990 --> 01:40:45,290
I honestly thought it was so fucking smart.

2292
01:40:45,290 --> 01:40:46,010
It's just pens.

2293
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:48,270
It's just pens.

2294
01:40:51,770 --> 01:40:52,990
Thank you, guys.

2295
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:54,430

01:40:56,810 --> 01:40:57,850
Alright, so...

2297
01:40:59,930 --> 01:41:03,890
I guess we're never gonna I guess we're gonna live here forever now.

2298
01:41:04,530 --> 01:41:08,690
Remember when I said this level only takes 15 minutes to complete?

2299
01:41:09,030 --> 01:41:10,130
Well, then...

2300
01:41:13,190 --> 01:41:14,630
No, I can get up.

2301
01:41:14,690 --> 01:41:17,110
I can open these doors to climb up.

2302
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:21,130
Remember when I said this is a 15 minute level?

2303
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:23,450
Well...

2304
01:41:25,790 --> 01:41:26,910

2307
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:32,770
Gumi is alive.

2308
01:41:32,970 --> 01:41:34,210
Did Gumi wake up?

2309
01:41:34,310 --> 01:41:35,390
Did she wake up, chat?

2310
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:43,590
Alright, time...

2311
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:45,410
Wait, look it up.

Well, then...

2321
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:57,730

2326

01:42:24,410 --> 01:42:25,010
Maybe...

2336
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:27,930
She'll never sleep with you.

2337
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:29,630
I hope that good she was asleep.

2338

2364
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:49,140
What's on the other side of the stairs?

2365
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:51,300
The other side of the stairs is just, um...

2366
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:51,940
Just toys.

2367
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:53,540
There's no key down there.

2368
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:55,280
Dude, we've been...

2369
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,440
How long have we been stuck here?

2371
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,980
We went here...

2372
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:06,500
We went here already.

2373
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,020
This is Harold.

2374
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:10,480
This is where we...

2375
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:15,900

01:44:15,940 --> 01:44:16,360
Welcome back.

2377
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:22,100
How many times have we been here, chat?

2378
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:24,220
How many fucking times have we been here?

2379
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:29,080
Oh my god.

2380
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:37,200
No, we explored the entire house.

2381
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:37,980
That's the thing.

2382
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:39,520
Do I just go outside?

2383
01:44:44,340 --> 01:44:44,740
I'm sorry.

2384
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:45,500

2386
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:46,040
I'm sorry.

2387
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:46,820

2388
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:51,360
That's a great...

2389
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,340
Wait, this is locked too!

2390
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:55,580
Why is everything locked?

2391
01:44:57,860 --> 01:44:59,060
That's a great...

2392
01:44:59,060 --> 01:44:59,960
Thank you, sis.

2393
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:02,440
Why is everything locked?

2394
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:05,000
Please!

2395
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:06,620
I don't know what to do!

2396
01:45:10,620 --> 01:45:11,860
Who's that sound?

2397
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,060
Who's that sound?

2398
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:17,600
Oh!

2399
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:18,280
Oh!

2400
01:45:19,180 --> 01:45:19,700
Oh!

2401
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:25,340
Oh!

2402
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:28,100
Oh, that was me moving the shoes.

2403
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:28,700
Right?

2404
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:30,080
That's the shoes, right?

2405
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:31,280
Right?

2406
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:31,940
Not Harold?

2407
01:45:40,850 --> 01:45:41,370
Oh!

2408
01:45:45,190 --> 01:45:46,390
Harold, I'm sorry.

2409
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:46,910
Harold.

2410
01:45:49,530 --> 01:45:51,430
I'm gonna go back in my happy area.

2411
01:45:51,630 --> 01:45:53,590
I'm gonna go back in my happy area.

2412
01:45:57,210 --> 01:45:58,590
Oh, my god.

2413
01:45:58,590 --> 01:45:59,250
What is this?

2414
01:46:00,530 --> 01:46:02,050
What is this?

2415
01:46:06,030 --> 01:46:08,310
I'm so fucking angry.

2416
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:10,570
How do I finish this?

2417
01:46:11,450 --> 01:46:12,070
How do I finish this?

2418
01:46:12,810 --> 01:46:15,370
We've been stuck here for 20 years, chat.

2419
01:46:15,850 --> 01:46:16,410
We've been stuck here for 20 years, chat.

2420
01:46:22,790 --> 01:46:24,030
Where is it?

2421
01:46:24,970 --> 01:46:26,270
Okay, we're gonna...

2422
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:27,190
Alright, okay.

2423
01:46:28,610 --> 01:46:29,670
We got this.

2424
01:46:30,970 --> 01:46:32,730
Let me check all the rooms again.

2425
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:33,130
Okay.

2426
01:46:40,780 --> 01:46:42,160
I'm checking everything.

2427
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:45,260
I'm checking everything.

2428
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:47,920
I'm checking everything.

2429
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:48,940
Oh, what's this?

2430
01:46:49,220 --> 01:46:49,740
Oh, my god.

2431
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:50,340
This is a fucking door.

2432
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:51,040
This is a door!

2433
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:52,160
It's a fucking door!

2434
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:00,540
We're all stupid!

2435
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:02,180
We're all stupid!

2436
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:05,720
Let me in!

2437
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,100
Baby, I'm...

2438
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:10,060
All I had to do was go down!

2439
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:12,660
Baby had to go down!

2440
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:15,680
Light!

2441
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:21,070
Wait, this is killing me?

2442
01:47:21,110 --> 01:47:21,770
Oh, this kills me.

2443
01:47:21,850 --> 01:47:22,490
Wait, what?

2444
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:25,150
I just went towards the light!

2445
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:32,510
It said light!

2446
01:47:33,310 --> 01:47:34,670
That is light!

2447
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:39,780
Fire hot.

2448
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:42,320
Okay, apparently fire is very hot.

2449
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:43,060
Look.

2450
01:47:43,940 --> 01:47:44,540
Hey, look.

2451
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:45,060
Thank god.

2452
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:50,180
You know, okay, that makes sense.

2453
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:54,160
Cause I was wondering, like, why am I freaked out about the heater?

2454
01:47:54,540 --> 01:47:54,920
And...

2455
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,540
Yo, guys, do you guys know?

2456
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:00,520
Fire is bad for babies?

2457
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:03,240
Something I learned today.

2458
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:03,960
Fire bad.

2459
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:06,800

You appreciate it.

2462
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:10,400
Have a... have a fun heart.

2463
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:11,300
Thank you so much.

2464
01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:14,420
I'll have my Amazon package here later cause I'm about to have fires at it.

2465
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:14,800
Oof.

2466
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:16,000
Oh my gosh.

2467
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:21,040
Hey, today I learned that that fire is very bad for you.

2468
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:21,880
Oh, please.

2469
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:26,880
Oh, Rasty, thank you so much for the follow.

Have a fun heart.

2473
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:29,860
Thank you.

2474
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:35,180
That really sucks though.

2475
01:48:35,660 --> 01:48:37,280
That really fucking...

2476
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:37,960
Oh, do I have to...

2477
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:39,100
Fire.

2478
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:40,980
Fire?

2479
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:45,440
Fire!

2480
01:48:47,740 --> 01:48:51,440
Thank you.

2481
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:52,880
Have a... have a fun heart.

2482
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:53,840
Thank you so much.

2483
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:54,580
Okay.

2484
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:57,500
Look, I didn't use my brain.

2485
01:48:57,700 --> 01:48:59,480
It took me 20 minutes to find...

2486
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:01,220
find the stupid...

2487
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:01,960
Dude, please.

2488
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:02,480
I...

2489
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:03,480
Oh, window.

2490
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:04,580
Window.

2491
01:49:06,820 --> 01:49:08,600
I was like, what do you want me to do?

2492
01:49:11,380 --> 01:49:11,840
Pause!

2493
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:12,820
Holy shit.

2494
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,200
Thank you so much for the tier one.

2495
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:16,980
41 month streak.

2496
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:18,000
Woo!

2497
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:19,100
That is... okay.

2498
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:19,720
It's okay.

2499
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:20,940
Fire is very far from me.

2500
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:21,240
Woo!

2501
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:23,500
Can we get some Bargnite real quick for Pulse?

2502
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:24,780
Holy shit.

2503
01:49:25,060 --> 01:49:26,440
He was... he was super.

2504
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:28,680
He was like my super OG.

2505
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:30,820
OG, OG sub.

2506
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:31,780
Viewer.

2507
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:34,440
Okay, fire bad.

2508
01:49:35,300 --> 01:49:36,040
Fire bad.

2509
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:44,200
Okay.

2510
01:49:50,070 --> 01:49:50,470
Alright.

2511
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:54,250
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

2512
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:55,990
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

2513
01:49:55,990 --> 01:49:56,690
Okay.

2514
01:49:56,830 --> 01:49:57,270
Okay.

2515
01:49:57,730 --> 01:49:58,430
Hey there.

2516
01:49:58,890 --> 01:49:59,330
Alright.

2517
01:49:59,450 --> 01:50:00,190
How do I get up?

2518
01:50:00,230 --> 01:50:01,550
Do I have to move this box over?

2519
01:50:02,310 --> 01:50:02,910
It's okay.

2520
01:50:03,910 --> 01:50:04,350
Oh!

2521
01:50:04,510 --> 01:50:04,870
Woah!

2522
01:50:05,030 --> 01:50:05,350
Woah!

2523
01:50:05,510 --> 01:50:05,950
Please!

2524
01:50:06,170 --> 01:50:07,470
I don't know how to get up there!

2525
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:11,530
I'm running!

2526
01:50:12,230 --> 01:50:13,470
Oh my god!

2527
01:50:13,610 --> 01:50:14,410
Fire bad!

2528
01:50:15,130 --> 01:50:15,970
Okay, I got this.

2529
01:50:16,910 --> 01:50:18,770
Alright, I just need to slowly push this.

2530
01:50:22,190 --> 01:50:23,730
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

2531
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:35,140
Okay.

2532
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:37,400
I thought I could push it all the way.

2533
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:40,600
What the fuck?

2534
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:44,140
Wow!

2535
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:45,920
What is that kill range?

2536
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:47,700
He just gets third quarters.

2537
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:48,460
Damn!

2538
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:51,020
This is looking strong ass heater right here.

2539
01:50:51,220 --> 01:50:52,400
I'm sorry, heater.

2540
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:53,580
I'm sorry.

2541
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:55,220
I'm running.

2542
01:50:55,620 --> 01:50:56,060
Please.

2543
01:50:58,380 --> 01:50:58,820
Wait.

2544
01:50:58,820 --> 01:50:59,580
What the fuck?

2545
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:00,800
The chair is... Wait, what the fuck?

2546
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:01,800
The chair is back there.

2547
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:04,420
Wait, what?

2548
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:07,120
The chair is already back there.

2549
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:11,600
Alright.

2550
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:14,380
Yeah, you think I'm scared of you?

2551
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:16,440
Turn radio on.

2552
01:51:17,380 --> 01:51:18,300
Equals happy.

2553
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:19,660
Radio equals happy.

2554
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:21,460
Yeah, that's right.

2555
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:23,940
Get in my stomach.

2556
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,960
Okay, now what do I do with this?

2557
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:30,220
Wait, what do I...

2558
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:31,900
Okay, I finished it.

2559
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:32,180
Woo!

2560
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:32,700
We finished!

2561
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:33,820
Woo!

2562
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,280
The radio on the way equals happy?

2563
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:38,140
Oh shit.

2564
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:40,220
Shit, what did you order?

2565
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:44,200
What did you get Felicity?

2566
01:51:44,420 --> 01:51:45,000
Okay, okay.

2567
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:54,340
Okay, baby can't crawl apparently.

2568
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:57,940
Now it's upstairs open.

2569
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:01,780
It's upstairs open now?

2570
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:05,320
What else does Anxiety have to resolve there?

2571
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:06,340
Oh no!

2572
01:52:06,940 --> 01:52:08,220
You're okay Felicity.

2573
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:10,340
What the fuck?

2574
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:11,360
Harold?

2575
01:52:15,740 --> 01:52:17,280
Does the baby just go...

2576
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:18,840
at me?

2577
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:23,560
Oh, upstairs!

2578
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:25,400
I didn't need a key after all!

2579
01:52:25,580 --> 01:52:27,160
I just had to go to the fucking basement!

2580
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:31,600
I didn't need a key after all!

2581
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:32,900
Wait, what?

2582
01:52:33,060 --> 01:52:33,980
Do I need a key here?

2583
01:52:44,030 --> 01:52:45,470
Oh my gosh.

2584
01:52:46,630 --> 01:52:47,590
Hey guys!

2585
01:52:48,110 --> 01:52:48,590
Harold?

2586
01:52:49,550 --> 01:52:50,030
Harold?

2587
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:52,730
Harold?

2588
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:04,620
So why are we putting a visage?

2589
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:05,220
Never.

2590
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:12,840
Oh!

2591
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:14,840
Oh, let me in!

2592
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:15,860
Let me in!

2593
01:53:16,860 --> 01:53:18,140
I don't know how to close it.

2594
01:53:18,220 --> 01:53:20,740
I don't know how to close it!

2595
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:21,720
Why is it open?

2596
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:25,440
Please Harold.

2597
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:27,520
Please don't come in Harold.

2598
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:29,820
Harold don't come in!

2599
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,200
Harold don't come in!

2600
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:36,900
I don't know how to close the doors apparently.

2601
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:38,000
I don't know how to close the doors apparently.

2602
01:53:38,020 --> 01:53:38,800
Baby dumb!

2603
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:40,080
Baby stupid!

2604
01:53:54,290 --> 01:53:55,250
Oh fuck.

2605
01:53:58,090 --> 01:53:59,210
Hey don't come in.

2606
01:53:59,270 --> 01:54:00,550
Change it closer right now.

2607
01:54:03,950 --> 01:54:05,630
Oh god, baby needs to climb?

2608
01:54:06,450 --> 01:54:07,770
Why are you making baby climb?

2609
01:54:07,770 --> 01:54:09,690
Baby too stupid for that.

2610
01:54:10,110 --> 01:54:11,030
Baby dumb!

2611
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:21,170
What the fuck?

2612
01:54:22,170 --> 01:54:23,210
What the fuck?

2613
01:54:23,230 --> 01:54:24,050
Baby go up?

2614
01:54:24,370 --> 01:54:24,930
Wait what?

2615
01:54:29,390 --> 01:54:30,830
How do baby go up?

2616
01:54:31,570 --> 01:54:32,150
Up?

2617
01:54:32,730 --> 01:54:33,330
Up?

2618
01:54:33,770 --> 01:54:34,370
Up?

2619
01:54:36,110 --> 01:54:37,810
No chair for me.

2620
01:54:38,410 --> 01:54:39,690
No chair for me.

2621
01:54:39,730 --> 01:54:40,230
Parkour!

2622
01:54:40,350 --> 01:54:41,770
Baby parkour apparently.

2623
01:54:41,770 --> 01:54:44,130
What the fuck is this stupid shit?

2624
01:54:44,170 --> 01:54:45,250
Baby parkour?

2625
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:49,610
Parkour.

2626
01:54:51,670 --> 01:54:52,230
Parkour.

2627
01:54:52,230 --> 01:54:54,830
This game is a platformer right?

2628
01:54:58,740 --> 01:54:59,300
Parkour.

2629
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:00,060
Parkour.

2630
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:05,560
Parkour.

2631
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:05,760
Are you?

2632
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:06,660
Oh you dumb bitch!

2633
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:08,020
You stupid dumb bunny.

2634
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:13,020
I'm stupid.

2635
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:14,180
Who can tell my baby?

2636
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:15,500
What the fuck?

2637
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:15,700
What the fuck?

2638
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:26,320
What the fuck?

2639
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:29,320
What the fuck?

2640
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:30,020
What am I watching?

2641
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:32,140
We are watching baby right now.

2642
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:34,240
You dumb bitch.

2643
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:35,340
I'm falling out the window.

2644
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:35,820
What the fuck?

2645
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:40,660
Oh my god.

2646
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:42,880
Harold?

2647
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:44,900
Harold is that you?

2648
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:47,160
Hey Harold.

2649
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:15,940
What the fuck?

2650
01:56:15,940 --> 01:56:17,060
It just blocks me there?

2651
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:24,620
Baby go bye bye.

2652
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:27,760
Oh my god.

2653
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:29,700
The donkey boy.

2654
01:56:30,380 --> 01:56:31,480
Let me out.

2655
01:56:31,700 --> 01:56:32,560
Let me out.

2656
01:56:32,860 --> 01:56:34,020
Let the baby out.

2657
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:36,880
Baby out.

2658
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:37,960
Baby leave.

2659
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:40,740
Baby leave.

2660
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:42,740
Wait where the fuck is the doll?

2661
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:45,880
Bye.

2662
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:53,700
Baby go out.

2663
01:56:55,340 --> 01:56:56,940
He doesn't care anymore.

2664
01:56:57,460 --> 01:56:58,500
Baby is leaving.

2665
01:57:00,220 --> 01:57:01,440
Baby doesn't care anymore.

2666
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:03,600
I think you just walked over it.

2667
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:05,500
They actually just left the...

2668
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:06,120
No he's here.

2669
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:07,500
Look he's here.

2670
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:08,180
Look at that.

2671
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:11,880
What?

2672
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:14,580
Oh mom.

2673
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:16,500
Mom what the fuck?

2674
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:20,560
Hey mom.

2675
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:23,840
I don't want to look at all of this.

2676
01:57:23,860 --> 01:57:24,980
I don't want to look at mom.

2677
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:30,240
It's too much.

2678
01:57:30,580 --> 01:57:30,960
No.

2679
01:57:34,260 --> 01:57:34,760
It's too much.

2680
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:35,520
Mom no.

2681
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:37,880
Where's Harold?

2682
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:38,600
Where's Harold?

2683
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:50,360
Holy shit the bunny.

2684
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:52,140
Remember the hiding.

2685
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:53,200
Oh shit ready to kill.

2686
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:55,120
Oh my god.

2687
01:57:59,070 --> 01:57:59,570
Guys.

2688
01:57:59,690 --> 01:58:00,930
Remember how this was a...

2689
01:58:00,930 --> 01:58:02,850
So it was a 15 minute level.

2690
01:58:03,790 --> 01:58:04,050
Oh please.

2691
01:58:04,610 --> 01:58:05,910
How long did that take me?

2692
01:58:10,870 --> 01:58:12,510
Most of my memories are in the about moving.

2693
01:58:12,630 --> 01:58:13,970
What's the start from where I'm moving to?

2694
01:58:14,030 --> 01:58:14,750
How empty it was.

2695
01:58:14,770 --> 01:58:15,650
Oh no.

2696
01:58:17,390 --> 01:58:18,190
14 minutes?

2697
01:58:18,370 --> 01:58:18,990
Oh shit.

2698
01:58:19,110 --> 01:58:20,530
I broke a record guys.

2699
01:58:20,790 --> 01:58:25,330
It only took me 14 minutes to fucking figure out that it was a basement.

2700
01:58:27,910 --> 01:58:30,230
To figure out there was a fucking basement.

2701
01:58:30,430 --> 01:58:32,230
It took me 14 minutes.

2702
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:37,550
Oh my god.

2703
01:58:37,590 --> 01:58:38,830
I'm so good at this game guys.

2704
01:58:41,510 --> 01:58:42,670
I can't believe.

2705
01:58:42,990 --> 01:58:44,910
It took us that fucking long.

2706
01:58:45,170 --> 01:58:47,550
To finish a 15 minute level.

2707
01:58:48,610 --> 01:58:49,610
Where's basement?

2708
01:58:53,110 --> 01:58:53,610
Alright.

2709
01:58:53,830 --> 01:58:54,790
I can't believe this.

2710
01:58:54,910 --> 01:58:56,030
Oh no Autumn.

2711
01:58:56,350 --> 01:58:56,810
Sorry.

2712
01:58:57,210 --> 01:58:57,890
Don't worry.

2713
01:58:57,970 --> 01:58:59,330
It was just me yelling we're baby.

2714
01:58:59,590 --> 01:59:00,290
We're key.

2715
01:59:00,530 --> 01:59:01,410
Don't worry Autumn.

2716
01:59:01,570 --> 01:59:02,210
It's 12 minutes.

2717
01:59:02,230 --> 01:59:05,750
20 minutes of that was just me shouting where the fuck's the key and going around.

2718
01:59:08,130 --> 01:59:11,590
And like walking around the house 20 times.
