00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:02,160
Hello everybody... Sorry, I got to do the croaky greeting, the caw-caw!

2
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,260
Sorry, no, that's not the croaky greeting, this is the croaky greeting.

3
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:27,420
Hello everybody, and welcome to JustCrowThings, where I, Croaky, am gonna play a crow game.

4
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:39,020
I need you guys to know, the amount of people that, like, added me for this game, like, even my staff members were, like, adding me, and was like, oh my god, you gotta play this game.

5
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,240
They were like, this game is awesome!

6
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:48,160
This game reminded me of Croaky, and I was like, I guess it's time, it's time to bring out Croaky.

7
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,680
Free Croaky from the closet.

8
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,480
It's locked in the closet till it was croaky time.

9
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:14,140
Okay, so also, by the way guys, um, I don't know if you guys noticed this, but, like, every day, almost every stream, the last, like, one, two, three, four, five streams, I've been playing around with my stream settings.

10
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:24,360
So, like, if my streams have been, like, super fucking weird, it's because every day, for the last, like, five streams, it's been different stream settings.

11
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,440
Yeah, my ocean is in 1440p!

12
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,700
Snoop's leaving the super chat, thank you, thank you!

13
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:36,340
Because I realized, I was like, wait, this looks, okay, I was like, my streams have been looking really weird lately.

14
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,460
I think it's because of my new CPU.

15
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,600
I noticed, like, um, yeah, I've been fucking freestyling.

16
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,580
That's why, like, my streams have been, like, super wonky.

17
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,960
Like, I've been, like, fucking around with bitrate.

18
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,760
I've been fucking around with stream settings.

19
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,200
And I was like, oh, how do I stream in 1440p?

20
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,000
Maybe that will fix it.

21
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,360
And then I noticed, like, Wukong, the Wukong, when I was streaming Wukong game, it was extra crunchy.

22
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,660
So, I was, like, trying to figure it out.

23
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,640
I was like, how the fuck, how do I fix this?

24
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,660
How do I?

25
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,380
Why is it so?

26
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,420
Why is it so crunch?

27
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,040
Oh, shit.

28
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,520
Okay, no, I don't want to listen to this.

29
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,380
I was like, why is it so crunchy?

30
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,980
So, so, every, so, like, I think I figured it out.

31
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,800
I don't know if I actually did, though.

32
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,840
But, like, maybe we're doing 1440p.

33
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,000
Um, it will be different.

34
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,280
But, yes, I finally, I figured out how to do 1440p.

35
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,860
Um, I'm not sure if that will fix the crunchy, bitrate, the crunchiness of everything.

36
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,420
Um, at one point, I was even, like, what if I just do 18,000 bitrate?

37
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,120
Like, I, I have, I have the internet for it.

38
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,760
Like, what if, what if, what if you ate, but then it didn't work.

39
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,860
It, like, I had, like, weird-ass stutters.

40
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,900
So, I was, like, like, I had, like, stream stutters.

41
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,400
But, I was, like, is that because of the game?

42
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,280
Or because I put too much bitrate?

43
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,320
So, now I'm back at, um, I'm back at 13k bitrate.

44
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,360
But, like, I figured out how to do 1440p.

45
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,700
So, like, maybe it'll look, does my stream look better?

46
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,060
I don't, I don't know.

47
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,360
Isn't it?

48
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,920
Oh, my God.

49
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,860
I think Croaky deserves to be at 1440p.

50
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,840
So, like, I hope the quality, like, improves.

51
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,100
I even did, like, uh, yeah, too much bitrate is bad.

52
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,600
Yeah, I noticed that.

53
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,640
Because I was, like, maybe if I up the bitrate for Wukong, it'll be less crunchy.

54
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,880
Because people were commenting.

55
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,480
Were, like, up your bitrate, Doki!

56
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,780
Up it!

57
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,780
And I was, like, why are you yelling at me?

58
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,260
I'm Croaky.

59
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,980
I was, like, I was, like, why are you yelling at me?

60
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,820
I'm just a bird.

61
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
But, but, yeah.

62
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,960
So, like, I lowered.

63
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,060
I lowered the bitrate back to the 13k bitrate.

64
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,360
And then unlocked 1440p.

65
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,580
To be a little.

66
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,600
I'm just a little crow.

67
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,300
I'm just.

68
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,000
Front-facing Croaky won't hurt you.

69
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,320
Don't worry.

70
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,060
Front-facing Croaky isn't real.

71
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,320
Front-facing Croaky won't hurt you.

72
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,500
Thank you for the magenta soup.

73
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,700
Thank you, thank you.

74
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,220
It's, like, it's, like, Phineas and Ferb.

75
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,800
Front-facing Phineas won't hurt you.

76
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,300
Doki would definitely play.

77
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,380
And the prophecy is true.

78
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah!

79
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,040
Thank you for the magenta soup.

80
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,800
Thank you, thank you.

81
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,140
But, yeah.

82
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,920
I hope I figured out the correct.

83
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,780
This is the last, like, last setting I have to play around with.

84
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,720
And, like, we figured it out for real this time.

85
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,440
So, yeah.

86
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,900
That's why every stream has been looking really fucked up lately.

87
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,900
And, like, streams have been really weird quality.

88
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,300
So, I feel like every, every week there's something.

89
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,760
Every week there's something for Doki.

90
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,630
Yeah.

91
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,410
I'm on a 1440p monitor.

92
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,590
This is the Croaky we needed.

93
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,970
Thank you for the super chat.

94
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,350
Thank you.

95
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,310
Thank you, Reni.

96
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:31,830
Also, like, there's, like, there's, like, some stuff I like doing as Croaky.

97
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,690
Let me show you guys.

98
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,010
Let me show you guys.

99
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:35,950
All right.

100
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,590
Yes, there's settings.

101
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,130
This is...

102
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,410
I thought this was really funny.

103
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,450
I was, like, playing around with, like, settings.

104
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,090
And then there's, like, there's, like, stuff that would make me, like, look better.

105
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,610
But then there was...

106
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,090
There's, like, graying, too.

107
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,410
So, we can add, like, a cinematic feel to it.

108
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,890
But this one's my favorite.

109
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,390
Ba-da-ba-da-bum.

110
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,790
Ba-da-bum-bum.

111
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,770
Ba-na-na-na.

112
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,790
Ba-da-na-na.

113
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:00,790
Ba-da-ba...

114
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:04,820
.

115
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:04,880
.

116
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,260
.

117
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,840
Bag tomato.

118
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,880
I just wanted to, I just wanted to show you guys that one.

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,760
So, like, I could actually, like, face different directions, but I figured, like, this was the best one.

120
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:04,920
There's a reason why, because I was like, what if I just streamed like this the entire time?

121
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,390
I was like, do I do front facing?

122
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,610
But then...

123
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,370
And also, I did not like the shadow on this side.

124
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,430
I feel like, I don't know.

125
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:26,750
I feel like I like the no shadow part from this side.

126
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,010
That's why we're facing this side today.

127
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,050
Yeah.

128
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,270
Front facing croaky can't hurt you no more.

129
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,170
Don't worry.

130
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,570
Front facing croaky will not hurt you guys.

131
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,570
Front facing croaky doesn't exist.

132
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,370
He's not real.

133
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,670
She's not real.

134
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,810
But yes, today we're gonna be crows.

135
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,070
I feel like that's very self explanatory.

136
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,930
We're gonna be, we're a crow and we're gonna play as a crow today.

137
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,610
Any life life updates?

138
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,070
Let me see.

139
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,170
I did write some stuff.

140
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,070
Oh yeah.

141
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,990
Oh yeah.

142
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,330
Dad is a menace right now.

143
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,350
He is a fucking menace.

144
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,850
He found the box that's filled with dog stuff.

145
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:19,150
Like today, I heard like rummaging outside my office.

146
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,110
Room.

147
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,290
And then I was like, what the fuck is that?

148
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,570
And then I went outside.

149
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:29,890
I went to the living room and I saw him like, I saw him on top of a box.

150
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,310
Half his body was inside the box.

151
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,090
And he was trying to grab toys.

152
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,470
Cause like, I thought it was weird.

153
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,630
I was like, how did he find this ball?

154
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,090
I thought I put away this ball in the box.

155
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,950
And then like, so that, but I ignored it.

156
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,770
I was like, Oh, maybe like, you know, maybe the bag was out.

157
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,250
And then he just like, got there, you know?

158
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,510
But then like, I realized.

159
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,570
And then I was like, no, wait a minute.

160
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,330
That's weird.

161
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,390
That's like weird.

162
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:02,450
And then like, I saw like, I caught him in the act and this is what I saw.

163
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,070
I'm going to show you a picture of what I drew the picture out.

164
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,950
Cause I was telling my friends about it.

165
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,050
I was like, what the fuck?

166
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,410
He's a fucking, this is what I saw.

167
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,110
And I was like, Dad!

168
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:17,890
Dad!

169
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:18,490
Dad!

170
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:18,710
Dad!

171
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,590
I was like, oh shit.

172
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:26,370
Like half his body was like in the box.

173
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,830
And he was like, trying to find his toys and stuff.

174
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,490
I was like, oh my God.

175
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,870
Like,

176
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,770
and then to put a box on top of the box, because, you know, I didn't want him to, I was worried.

177
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,330
He's going to find something, eat it.

178
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,070
Like, cause like, cause like dogs eat the craziest shit.

179
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,770
And I was like, I don't want to fucking find something and then just eat it.

180
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,670
Um, but he jumped on top of the box and then it was just like rummaging, rummaging it.

181
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,070
I was like, what the fuck are you doing?

182
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,170
Anyway.

183
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,070
Anyway.

184
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,410
Oh yeah.

185
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,390
But we're also here.

186
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,830
I can, I can do other faces too.

187
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,450
Give me that.

188
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,050
Whoa.

189
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,430
Is that a shiny?

190
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,670
Is that an Akasupa?

191
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,010
That's so shiny.

192
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,830
And I could do, hmm.

193
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,030
That's sus.

194
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:19,840
Hmm.

195
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,140
That's pretty sus, man.

196
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,200
And then also like, I didn't just, it's EP time.

197
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,890
Also, like I can't my arms out, but like my arms are tired right now.

198
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,010
Whoa.

199
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,030
Oh, sorry.

200
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:46,430
Whoa.

201
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,390
Is that an Akasupa?

202
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,410
Guys, thank you for the Akasupa.

203
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,150
Thank you.

204
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:53,810
Thank you.

205
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,750
Whoa.

206
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,130
Is that an Akasupa?

207
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,890
Excuse me, is that... what you got there?

208
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,850
What you got there?

209
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,030
Whoa!

210
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,490
Darkblade!

211
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,430
Is that... whoa, is that Akasupa?

212
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:16,830
Shiny!

213
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,950
Darkblade, thank you for the Akasupa!

214
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,310
Thank you, thank you!

215
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,050
Cookie, I've been busy and gone for a week, but I'm so happy I can return!

216
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,530
Be blessed to see my real...

217
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,210
Cookie, I love you, Cookie!

218
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,850
Okay, let's actually... let's actually play the game.

219
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:36,850
So yeah, that's me!

220
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,090
That's me!

221
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:39,950
That's me!

222
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,090
Oh!

223
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:41,990
Whoa!

224
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,610
Is that another Akasupa?

225
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,170
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wow!

226
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,310
Thank you for the Akasupa, media!

227
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,290
Thank you, thank you!

228
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,590
Fine, here's your Akasupa.

229
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,970
Look, he even looks like me!

230
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,550
Look!

231
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,990
He even looks like me!

232
00:13:59,390 --> 00:13:59,950
All right, start.

233
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,730
I don't want to play any of the controls, but like, can't be that bad.

234
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:04,870
You're a fucking crow.

235
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,310
How hard can crow trolls be?

236
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,630
It's literally a crow.

237
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,290
My, my, my.

238
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,510
You're growing so fast, little crow.

239
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,090
That's me!

240
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,270
You make me proud to be your grandma.

241
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:23,890
I remember being young like you, so full of energy, so full of not having back pain.

242
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,330
Oh, no.

243
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:27,550
32!

244
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,690
Oh, wait, no, crows live a long time.

245
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,030
I forgot.

246
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:40,790
That's why, like, by the way, like, don't own birds because, like, especially, like, bigger form of birds, like cockatiels and shit, because they live for a very long time.

247
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:45,550
Like, you think, like, oh, yeah, they'll live, like, you know, like, dogs and cats, like, short lifespan.

248
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,850
No, they're, like, their lifespans are, like, adults.

249
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:49,430
Like...

250
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,790
Like, their lifespans are, like, people.

251
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,050
Like, some cockatiels can live up to 60 plus years old.

252
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,070
So, like, it's literally a child.

253
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,170
But who doesn't go to college.

254
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,490
A child that you don't have to pay college tuition for.

255
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,930
So, yeah.

256
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:15,790
So, that's why, like, my advice is to, if you want to own a pet, just remember birds are, like, a lifelong commitment.

257
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,930
Alas, I'm already at the tender age of 32.

258
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,050
It is almost time for you to leave our nest and see the world.

259
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,230
But first, you must abide by our tradition.

260
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,470
Before a crow can leave, they must help maintain our nest.

261
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,990
Can you drop down, find an item that you like, and bring it back to me?

262
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,660
At 32, you're dead in internet years.

263
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,080
Okay.

264
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,780
Alright, what the fuck?

265
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,780
That's a treasure chest.

266
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,980
How big is this nest?

267
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,900
Oh, wait.

268
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,620
Okay, I learned the most important thing in this game.

269
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:57,720
Swoop?

270
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,660
What is swoop?

271
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,220
Okay, wait.

272
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,180
Wait.

273
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,220
Wait.

274
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,700
Oh, no.

275
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,860
This is hard.

276
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,360
Aiming this is hard.

277
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,000
Oh!

278
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,940
That's a king, right?

279
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,580
That's right.

280
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,600
Now, I shall eat you.

281
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,680
Okay, what am I supposed to grab?

282
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,560
The FPS.

283
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,760
The FPS.

284
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,220
The FPS cro- crokey is here.

285
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,480
Oh, hey.

286
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,060
Oh, this?

287
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,920
Does grandma want this?

288
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,560
Hello, grandma.

289
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,880
I got you the thing you want.

290
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,260
Beautiful!

291
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,520
With every generation, our nest changes and evolves.

292
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,520
Now it's time I give you something from the nest.

293
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,520
Something very special.

294
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,280
What do I get?

295
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,840
I get a glasses!

296
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,860
I get sunglasses.

297
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,740
These glasses have warm colors.

298
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,120
They were worn by me when I was your age.

299
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,420
And my grandma before.

300
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,180
And my grandma's grandma before.

301
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,860
Where's my mom?

302
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,240
Where's my dad?

303
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,660
Am I an orphan?

304
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,920
They're a reminder what sick birds we are.

305
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
Our sacred family heirloom.

306
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,700
Treasure it well.

307
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,560
Wait, where's my parents, grandma?

308
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,840
Grandma-ma?

309
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,060
Now, go on.

310
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,780
There's so much to learn.

311
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,800
Talk with the various animals in the village.

312
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,520
They will teach you all the crowy things.

313
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,380
Go on and have fun.

314
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,960
Am I an orphan, grandma?

315
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,720
They got cockatiel?

316
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,100
Like, what was it?

317
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,840
The cuckoo birds?

318
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,240
Did the cuckoo birds kill them?

319
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,080
Is this a Disney film?

320
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,080
All right, let's go.

321
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,760
Oh, no.

322
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,060
Am I...

323
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,500
Am I...

324
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,320
Am I in a Disney film?

325
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,240
I thought this was a blender icon.

326
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,080
Not gonna lie.

327
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,160
Okay, tab.

328
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,200
Oh, my God.

329
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,820
There's a map.

330
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,900
Oh, my God.

331
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,840
Thank fucking God.

332
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,480
There's a map.

333
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,860
After playing Wukong, this is like...

334
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,380
This is beautiful to see.

335
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,220
All right.

336
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,540
Space.

337
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,540
Where the fuck are you?

338
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,600
Hola, croaky.

339
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,260
I'm the mystical half-pony, half-hawk.

340
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,060
A pony hawk, if you will.

341
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,100
A rad creature of sick moves.

342
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,480
And it's so cute.

343
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,640
It has a speed of up to 100,000 kilometers per hour.

344
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,060
It's a super fast plane that can fly in a sizable speed.

345
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,860
Speaking of...

346
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,180
Tired of flying slowly?

347
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,060
There's an advanced form of flight called the swoop.

348
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,020
Every time you swoop, you gain a bit of speed.

349
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,320
Hold down the fly button and then press down swoop for a second to then release swoop.

350
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,100
You don't need to release the fly button while swooping.

351
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,940
Repeat this pattern until great distances quickly.

352
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,560
I feel like my parents were supposed to teach me this.

353
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,840
What have...

354
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,520
Is that the button?

355
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,200
Oh, my God.

356
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,460
Oh, my God.

357
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,520
Is that the crow of 87 using swoops?

358
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:58,860
Okay.

359
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,660
All right, let's go.

360
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,140
I was like thinking like, what am I?

361
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,240
Oh, shit.

362
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,600
I don't know how to fly because my parents are dead.

363
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,460
I don't think that was it.

364
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,460
I don't think I did it correctly.

365
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,340
That is what happens when my parents are dead.

366
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,980
I don't know how to fly.

367
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,240
Practice how to move through the world much quicker.

368
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,060
You can try restart and try again.

369
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,780
It's tricky, but you'll get the hang of it.

370
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,460
How the fuck?

371
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,760
How the fuck do I do this?

372
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,240
Huh?

373
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,280
Okay.

374
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,500
I don't understand.

375
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,700
Oh, did I do it?

376
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,500
Okay.

377
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,800
Oh, I did it!

378
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,520
I don't need no parents!

379
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,940
Now I have their... now I have their death insurance.

380
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,400
Who even says it was an accident?

381
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,600
Oh, what's this?

382
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,340
It's a walnut.

383
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,820
Hello, I found your walnut.

384
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:01,920
Hey, you!

385
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,460
I'm gearing up for winter and my kidlets, those little rascals scattered my walnuts.

386
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,860
Can you please use your amazing beak and bring them back to me, pretty please?

387
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,760
What's in it for me?

388
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,440
When you carry an object, you'll see a red aiming pin.

389
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,580
You can't even cross it to the ground.

390
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,120
It shows where the object will fall if you release it.

391
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,540
Oh, wow.

392
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,600
I can't believe it.

393
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,480
After my parents died, like somebody got life insurance for both of them.

394
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,880
I wonder who got who... I wonder what happened.

395
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,540
Well, the police said it was an accident.

396
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,740
It can't be me.

397
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,940
I was a child when it happened.

398
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,800
All right.

399
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,860
Where do I drop it?

400
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,580
Like here?

401
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,900
Is that it?

402
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,700
Here you go.

403
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,680
It was Graham.

404
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,160
All right.

405
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,100
Three.

406
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,580
I was like...

407
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,160
Oh, that rabbit did not like me.

408
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,780
I think I...

409
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,120
He was one of the victims.

410
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,220
Oh, shit!

411
00:20:59,460 --> 00:20:59,900
Whoops, sorry.

412
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,160
Sorry, I got a little...

413
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,360
I got a little excited.

414
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,140
Tookie took them through crime alley.

415
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,180
Much thank.

416
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,100
Remember, not all objects can be picked up.

417
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,260
Some will be too heavy.

418
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,620
You'll get a hang of it, though.

419
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,100
And don't forget to keep checking your map and quest log if you get lost.

420
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,540
I don't get lost.

421
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,380
You know what?

422
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,260
I don't need this map.

423
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,580
I know where I am.

424
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,060
Yeah, see?

425
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,440
Right here.

426
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,620
Hello there.

427
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,060
Hey, are you on flip-flop?

428
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,120
Darling.

429
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,720
What do you mean you don't use flip-flop?

430
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,180
I wasn't an...

431
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,460
I wasn't an iPad kid.

432
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,540
My parents were...

433
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,720
My parents were gone before I could become an iPad kid.

434
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,940
Over 13 million daily active users.

435
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,760
400,000 hours of content.

436
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,420
2 billion minutes watched today.

437
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,560
What do you mean those numbers mean nothing to you?

438
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,540
What do you mean those numbers mean nothing to you?

439
00:21:59,540 --> 00:21:59,640
What do you mean those numbers mean nothing to you?

440
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,960
Those numbers mean everything!

441
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,880
Numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers!

442
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,440
Let's start you off with baby steps.

443
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,440
How about just one quick question?

444
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:12,780
How about just one quick photo?

445
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,820
One little selfie?

446
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,040
Just try it now!

447
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,420
Numbers go up!

448
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,400
Croaky happy!

449
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,960
Okay, photo mode.

450
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,220
Oh shit!

451
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,340
Alright.

452
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,060
Whoa!

453
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,040
Whoa!

454
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,360
Okay, focus.

455
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,760
Alright.

456
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,100
Ooh, look at me.

457
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,140
I'm a cool-ass bird.

458
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,660
Whoa!

459
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,440
Whoa there!

460
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,240
Slow down!

461
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,620
All the ladies and all the boys!

462
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:48,560
Whoa!

463
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,720
Can't resist the croaky right there.

464
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,600
Alright.

465
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,320
Nice.

466
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,920
I think...

467
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,220
Whoops!

468
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,080
Okay.

469
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,700
That's a lot of photos.

470
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,160
Alright.

471
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,900
So cool.

472
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,040
I'm so cool.

473
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,600
Can you find the hedgehog?

474
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,040
Where the fuck's the hedgehog?

475
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,740
Hedgehog?

476
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,900
Okay, I can fly forever.

477
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,100
Oh, there he is!

478
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:13,960
Hello!

479
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,100
Help!

480
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,540
Humans!

481
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,480
Humans invading our forest!

482
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,660
You're a bird, right?

483
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,820
One of them wing fellas, right?

484
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,680
Do you realize you have a special power?

485
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,980
A power no other creatures possess?

486
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,340
Oh my god, what is it?

487
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:30,800
Am I special?

488
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,640
Am I the chosen one?

489
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,100
Can you guess what it is?

490
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,140
What is it?

491
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,860
Is it the one where it says, poop?

492
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,060
I don't know about you, but I feel like everybody poops.

493
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,760
Do you not poop?

494
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,660
It's not good for you.

495
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:49,920
Wrong!

496
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,980
It's not pooping?

497
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,920
You can poop down on...

498
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,520
It was!

499
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:54,800
Wait!

500
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,860
I was right!

501
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,140
You can poop down on unexpecting...

502
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,440
suspecting humans.

503
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,520
Please use this power to scare off the humans.

504
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,720
Oh, and you ran out of poop?

505
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,420
Don't forget to eat some fruit.

506
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,720
Wait, I have a poop.

507
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,020
Poop meter?

508
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,500
Oh, I'm hungry.

509
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,000
How do I eat this?

510
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,500
Oh my god!

511
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,280
Reloading!

512
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,260
Reloading!

513
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,680
Reloading!

514
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,660
Give me a sec, I'm reloading right now.

515
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,340
I'm a very mature crow.

516
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,400
Alright, where's the humans?

517
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,760
Where are they?

518
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,500
Where are the criminals at?

519
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,280
How am I supposed to save the forest if I don't know where they are?

520
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,300
Those fucking campers.

521
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,960
Look at them.

522
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:47,680
Poop!

523
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,240
Alright.

524
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,960
Oh my god, if only I had my aimbot right now.

525
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:54,600
Poop!

526
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,120
I don't need aimbot.

527
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,260
I'm a natural talented pro at PS player.

528
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,480
Easy.

529
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:03,980
Excellent!

530
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,300
This is the kind of chaos I want to see in the world.

531
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,520
Remember, with great poop comes great responsibility.

532
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,280
Now I'll let you onto another secret.

533
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,840
Some foods are special.

534
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,260
Oh my god!

535
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,580
I can upgrade my poop?

536
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,340
It will give you extra power.

537
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,600
But you'll find them later when the time is right.

538
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,060
Okay.

539
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,060
Why didn't grandma teach me any of this?

540
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:33,920
Oh, they're fine.

541
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:35,720
Hello.

542
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,620
You seem okay.

543
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,620
You don't seem that mad at me.

544
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,140
FPS pro.

545
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,220
Yosh, thank you for the super chat.

546
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:45,560
Thank you.

547
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Oh my god, what kind of special powers am I going to have?

548
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,400
Alright.

549
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:52,820
What's this?

550
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,400
Tools?

551
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,080
What's this?

552
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,820
Oh, it's a flashlight!

553
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,120
Wait, I want to grab this.

554
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,640
More like balloons and trash.

555
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,580
I can barely play it!

556
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,200
What the fuck?

557
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,420
Wait, oh, these are the...

558
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,380
Wait, is this the special pool?

559
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,160
How are they special?

560
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,120
Wait, how are these special?

561
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,120
It's like glowing.

562
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,700
Okay, wait.

563
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,440
No.

564
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,660
No, get over here.

565
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,320
Get over here!

566
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,400
Get over here and you test it out!

567
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,960
Oh my god!

568
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,360
So fast!

569
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,380
Oh no, I got too excited again.

570
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,900
I got too excited.

571
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,360
What's this?

572
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,280
Oh, there it is!

573
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,440
Oh!

574
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,540
I found Taco Bell!

575
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:44,800
Alright.

576
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,640
Get over here.

577
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,980
Get over here!

578
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:53,660
Dodgeball.

579
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,720
Alright, is this food too?

580
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,080
Oh no, no, it's too hot!

581
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,840
It's too hot!

582
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,880
It's too hot!

583
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,100
Everything is too hot!

584
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,740
Let me eat!

585
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,060
I need to eat!

586
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,260
Oh, I guess I can throw this.

587
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,580
Phew!

588
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,060
Alright.

589
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,800
Where do I go?

590
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,060
Oh wait, where does this go?

591
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:17,960
Hello?

592
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,780
This is apparently a quest.

593
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,440
Oh, it's a...

594
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,340
This might sound like a weird flex, but...

595
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,620
I think I can talk to animals.

596
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,200
Oh my god, is that Snow White?

597
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,180
You can't understand me, right bird?

598
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,320
You're hearing me.

599
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm not insane, right?

600
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,860
Tell me I'm not insane!

601
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,600
Tell me!

602
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,160
Ah!

603
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,260
You're not insane!

604
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,840
I'm just a really smart bird!

605
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,060
Well, honestly, maybe she is insane.

606
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,980
I'm the smart bird.

607
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,060
Maybe she wants to sing.

608
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,720
Oh shit, sorry.

609
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,780
No!

610
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,160
Sorry!

611
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,860
I need a diaper!

612
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,180
I can't hold it!

613
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,020
Hello?

614
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,120
Oh, sorry.

615
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,320
I was trying to play my clarinet.

616
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,600
Ah!

617
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,660
I'm sorry, Snow White!

618
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,720
Oops!

619
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,220
Oops!

620
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,520
Sorry!

621
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,520
I didn't mean to!

622
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,020
Whoops!

623
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,420
Sorry!

624
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,100
It's okay!

625
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,000
She's still okay!

626
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,180
That was not what I thought was gonna happen!

627
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,980
Snow White and the seven goats!

628
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,340
I'm so sorry!

629
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,120
I didn't know that was gonna happen!

630
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,280
Snow White!

631
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,380
I don't know what I'm doing!

632
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:57,920
Wee!

633
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,360
Wee!

634
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,020
Alright, well, whoops.

635
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,480
Hmm, I bet you think you're smarter than me, huh?

636
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,180
Yes.

637
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,980
Is that it?

638
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,880
Is that all she wanted to say?

639
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,380
I do think I'm smarter than you.

640
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,180
I can talk to humans!

641
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,300
I understand human speech patterns.

642
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,100
Wait, is this Link?

643
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,740
Oh my god!

644
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,420
Hey there.

645
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,060
Hahaha!

646
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,100
Ah!

647
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,160
I overslept!

648
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,000
Thank you for waking me up, bird!

649
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,580
Sorry.

650
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,460
Copyright-free Lonk.

651
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,880
Is this Lonk?

652
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,900
I need to go save the world!

653
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,060
That's Lonk, guys.

654
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,900
World ain't gonna save...

655
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,120
Oh!

656
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,600
I got the cap!

657
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,160
I got the Lonk cap!

658
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,480
Wait, does that mean I can break this?

659
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,220
What if I...

660
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,660
No.

661
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,760
I can't break it.

662
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,760
Alright.

663
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,540
What do I do with this key?

664
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,460
I have, like... I have gasoline and key.

665
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,740
I don't know what to do with it.

666
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,540
Like, does she want anything?

667
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,660
There's no way I actually want anything or she's just there?

668
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,400
Hey, hey, hey!

669
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,560
What am I supposed to do with that?

670
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,220
Alright, let's head over.

671
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:16,800
Let's exit.

672
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,860
We're not here to be a completionist.

673
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,660
Alright, it's like Mario time.

674
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,040
Smooth landing.

675
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,140
So smooth.

676
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,340
Yeah!

677
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,640
Oh, I got a hat!

678
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,700
Wait, I was supposed to... I was supposed to beat her up.

679
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,660
Snow White's been having it too good for too long.

680
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,480
Alright, nice.

681
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:50,780
Did you guys hear about that new Snow White movie and then how they... they like, CGI'd all the dwarves and stuff?

682
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,260
Stop!

683
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,040
Oh my god!

684
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,980
Oh my god, there's a gang!

685
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,160
I'm in... I'm on the wrong turf, guys.

686
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,400
There's crow gangs?

687
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,740
The squawk?

688
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,260
The squawk?

689
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,860
It isn't the new crow in town, eh?

690
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,020
Yeah, yeah.

691
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,100
What?

692
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,320
Who do they think they are?

693
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,780
Ah!

694
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,480
Oh, looks like you got yourself sunglasses, eh?

695
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,060
Yeah, my grandma said that I look really cool in it.

696
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,140
Kaka!

697
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,740
The crow goons!

698
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,740
No!

699
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,140
Now they're mine!

700
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,130
My glasses!

701
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,570
You ain't cool enough for sunglasses.

702
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,490
You're not cool...

703
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,510
Yeah, not cool enough!

704
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,970
So uncool!

705
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,970
My grandma said I was cool!

706
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:55,410
Ah!

707
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,210
Ah!

708
00:31:59,250 --> 00:31:59,930
Ah!

709
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,250
Besides, we need them more than you do.

710
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:11,130
We have bigger plans than mine, ya dig?

711
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,270
So go back home, kid.

712
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,950
You ain't getting him back.

713
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,010
Kaka!

714
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:19,810
Kaka!

715
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,410
I believe it.

716
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,370
My glasses!

717
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,370
Am I gonna be cool now?

718
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,250
The crow goons took my glasses!

719
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,490
Oh, what the fuck is this yarn world?

720
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:43,790
That's random.

721
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,310
Ma, ma!

722
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,290
You're quite the mysterious...

723
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,130
Quite the adventurous bird.

724
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,370
Looks like you unlocked some new hats.

725
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,470
You can always change your appearance by visiting me right here.

726
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,230
Don't be a stranger.

727
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:57,870
Come by!

728
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,850
Oh, new hat!

729
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,190
New hat!

730
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,250
Weeeeee.

731
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,710
I wanna change my hat.

732
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:08,990
New hat.

733
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,470
Okay, got the flowers.

734
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,570
I have...

735
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,790
I have long cat.

736
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,250
I like no hat for now.

737
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,630
I have skins too.

738
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,970
I can have scarf colors!

739
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,650
I think the orange Orange fits the best.

740
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,610
Oh my god, I can be naked.

741
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,850
Oh, I don't like that.

742
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,470
I don't... I don't like that.

743
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,110
Yeah, let's have the... Oh, I can pitch my crow.

744
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,730
Who was that?

745
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,390
I think it was this one.

746
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,830
Okay, I was like, which one was the original crow?

747
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,270
Alright, it's time for adventure, grandma.

748
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,430
I'm gonna go get my cool sunglasses back, I swear.

749
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:58,050
Okay, time to terrorize the town now.

750
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,110
Alright.

751
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,270
Oh, okay, there's races?

752
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,170
I don't want race.

753
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,810
I'm just here to find my cool sunglasses back.

754
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,140
That suits you so far.

755
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,700
Wait, you're here too, grandma?

756
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,400
My, my, your glasses are gone.

757
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,000
Your bigger object seems to be stolen as well.

758
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,160
Wait, they took my wallet?

759
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,080
Wait, where did they take my wallet?

760
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,380
I thought you just took my sunglasses.

761
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,780
Seems like a beginning of a grand adventure.

762
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,000
Sound guy, is everything okay so far?

763
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,900
Sorry, sound crow, is everything okay so far?

764
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,160
Let me explain how this goes.

765
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,440
There are animals all over this land who need your help.

766
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,540
You can find them easily by checking your map.

767
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:56,060
Go talk to them, learn what they need, help them, and earn cro-putation.

768
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,380
Once you hit 100 cro-putation, you can move on to the next area.

769
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:08,160
Each area lets you earn up to 150... Okay, cro-putation is not, like, repu-crow?

770
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,300
Why didn't they just call it repu-crow?

771
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,320
Repu-crow, like, cro-putation?

772
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,360
What kind of word is that?

773
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,040
Like, repu- if you're gonna add crow to things, just call it repu-crow.

774
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,960
So, you don't need to help all the animals, just enough.

775
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,740
And, uh, open the pause menu to check your progress, your task, and your current cro-putation.

776
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,120
Uh, yes, no, cro-putation sounds so weird.

777
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,120
It just doesn't roll off your tongue very well.

778
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,620
That's all, have fun now.

779
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,600
I don't know.

780
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,700
It's just me, though.

781
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,340
Alright, let's see.

782
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,960
Hello, what do you want from me?

783
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,180
Crowy, crowy, darling.

784
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,580
Look around.

785
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,060
A bunch of stuff is missing.

786
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,720
Those dastardly crows are stealing stuff.

787
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,880
Okay, not all crows.

788
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:03,420
Not all.

789
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,420
Look, those crows do not represent all crows.

790
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,480
Speaking of missing stuff...

791
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,760
Where is your swag?

792
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,720
What?

793
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,180
You don't have swag?

794
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,400
What kind of cro-

795
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,600
Darling, if you want to be the star of flip-flop, you need swag.

796
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,940
Fly around to find some sha-shiny?

797
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:34,920
Shiny?

798
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,200
Gold trinkets and bring them here.

799
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,760
If you want to take on those mean crows, you need to have style.

800
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,120
Also, here's a tip.

801
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,420
Swoop into a human to make them drop an item or snatch it off their hands.

802
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,040
In fact, swooping into any object will pick it up if it's not too heavy.

803
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,280
Got it.

804
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,820
Well, go on.

805
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,780
Swagger up.

806
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,820
Alright, time to grab some items.

807
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,260
What is this?

808
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,060
Alright.

809
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,340
Hello, people.

810
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,500
Oh, is that an item for me?

811
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,180
That's right.

812
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,760
Oh, money!

813
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:12,880
Yoink.

814
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,660
Hahaha.

815
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,140
Yay!

816
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,140
Thank you for the super chat.

817
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,220
Thank you, thank you.

818
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,520
Wow, guys, it was so sweet.

819
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,180
I got my first super chat, guys.

820
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:30,580
I got- Uh, dude, guys, thank you for the super chat.

821
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,280
Thank you, thank you.

822
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:31,540
Oh!

823
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,340
Whoa!

824
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,440
It's okay, I have no HP.

825
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,920
What's he gonna do?

826
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,700
Smack me?

827
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,240
It's okay.

828
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,020
No, I need that.

829
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:39,780
No, no!

830
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,920
I need that!

831
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,440
I need that super chat!

832
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,120
Please!

833
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,820
Oh!

834
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,360
My parents are dead!

835
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,460
Hahaha.

836
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,020
Hey, putting down the coins.

837
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,020
Boop!

838
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,100
How much do I need?

839
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,920
It doesn't even tell me how much I need.

840
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,260
It just grabs shiny.

841
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,800
Oh, collect!

842
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,440
Oh!

843
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,220
Okay.

844
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,520
Alright, time to rob him.

845
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,780
That's fucking right.

846
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,120
I'm ready.

847
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,760
I'm ready to rob you.

848
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,240
That's right.

849
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,080
Give me a sec.

850
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,620
Zoning on!

851
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,540
That's right.

852
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,200
Wait, you don't even have stuff for me to rob?

853
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,700
Boink!

854
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,180
Mine now.

855
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,300
Mine now.

856
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,560
What's this?

857
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,320
Oh, I can blow leaves.

858
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,600
Wait, how do I slap people with the broom?

859
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,240
Oh, it's gone.

860
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,220
Oops.

861
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,000
Alright, so I lost the...

862
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,980
I lost the... I lost the broom.

863
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,220
It like just... I think it like phased through the floor.

864
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,160
Hey, what's this?

865
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,620
Oh, it's fire!

866
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,420
I'm coming over.

867
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,200
Where is it?

868
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,960
There's like apparently... I remember there was a story of a crow that would actually terror...

869
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,480
Like you were not... You should never... That's fucking right.

870
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,000
Leave.

871
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,400
There's a crow... I don't remember where.

872
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,540
I think it was in Canada.

873
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,260
There's a crow where like...

874
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:12,140
You cannot go at a certain street because it was like... That was that crow's territory.

875
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,460
That's that crow's... That was that crow's street.

876
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,180
And if you go through that street, he would actually like attack you.

877
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,480
So nobody was like brave enough to go down the street anymore.

878
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,880
And then there was a crow with a knife too.

879
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,200
They were like, beware of the crow with the knife.

880
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,320
Give me more money.

881
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,740
Give me my money!

882
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,000
I'm here to collect my... my loans.

883
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,780
My protection... The protection money.

884
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,740
Remember the protection money?

885
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,460
Where is it?

886
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,360
That's fucking right.

887
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,100
Get over here.

888
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,960
Get over here.

889
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,180
Yeah, that's right.

890
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,740
Alright, nice.

891
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,580
I'm gonna grab this.

892
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,940
The crow... Yeah.

893
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,120
There's knife crow.

894
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,160
And then there was like a crow that would attack you on a specific street.

895
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,520
Hey,

896
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,160
look.

897
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,320
We had a deal.

898
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,240
You gotta pay me to protect yourself from me.

899
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,440
That was the deal.

900
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,640
Alright, nice.

901
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,460
Yay!

902
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,960
Crikey.

903
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,520
Thank you for the super chat.

904
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:17,840
Thank you.

905
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,420
Thank you.

906
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,720
Crikey isn't real.

907
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,280
Crikey can hurt you.

908
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,340
Crikey with...

909
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,560
Thank you for the super chat.

910
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,180
Thank you.

911
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,800
Thank you.

912
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,880
I didn't even need four coins.

913
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,680
I got it just because.

914
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,220
I didn't even need four coins.

915
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,580
Oh, is this a chalice?

916
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,680
Yay!

917
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,180
Why would I use, like, swooping powers when I literally have a flamethrower?

918
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,160
Alright.

919
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,240
This is... This is a glass.

920
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,060
Yay, Shawnee!

921
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,560
Okay, I need to find the bowl and the key now.

922
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,560
I mean, I assume they don't have it.

923
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,180
This is also...

924
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,000
This is also a flamethrower?

925
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,140
That's right.

926
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:05,860
Get away.

927
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,620
Get away.

928
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,080
Yeah, that's right.

929
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:07,580
You wanna hit me?

930
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,480
That's right.

931
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,220
Get away.

932
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:09,900
Where's the money?

933
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,540
Where's the fucking money?

934
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,040
That's fucking right.

935
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,620
Where is it?

936
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,500
Okay.

937
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,100
Oh, is there a...

938
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,880
Is this a bookstore?

939
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:22,880
Or a ramen?

940
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,420
I want ramen.

941
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,500
Let me in.

942
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,720
Let Crikey in.

943
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,940
Let Crikey in.

944
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,200
Crikey wants ramen.

945
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,780
Oh, my God.

946
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,400
They don't serve this crows.

947
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,520
This is...

948
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,280
This is discriminate crow.

949
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,720
Hello.

950
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,200
Hello.

951
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,900
Good day, bird.

952
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,860
That's me.

953
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,060
I am Rupert the Hedgehog.

954
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,180
You might see my twin brother around.

955
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,580
Well, me and my brother are quite different in many ways.

956
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,080
Crow-scrimination.

957
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:53,680
Sorry.

958
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,500
This is crow-scrimination.

959
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,920
Crikey demands ramen.

960
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,620
What do we share?

961
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,280
A certain thirst for unalterated chaos.

962
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,100
That's it.

963
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,540
Like me.

964
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:08,240
It would please me deeply to see you blow away some of the humans with briefcases.

965
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,180
How do you want me to do it?

966
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,800
Do you want me to blow them away?

967
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,340
Why, I'll leave that up to you to figure it out.

968
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,720
And oh, while you fly around, poop on your cars along the way.

969
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,760
Humans love it when you decorate their cars.

970
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,160
They do?

971
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,840
Oh, my God.

972
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,700
Is that true?

973
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,200
All right.

974
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,140
Don't worry.

975
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:23,760
I got you.

976
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,060
I'll decorate it.

977
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,920
Oh, you're leaving a little dot in the center.

978
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,380
Boop.

979
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,360
Boop.

980
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:32,520
Oh!

981
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,540
Holy shit.

982
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,740
What did I eat?

983
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,100
What the fuck?

984
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:39,180
Oh, my God.

985
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,240
What the fuck did I eat there?

986
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,620
All right.

987
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:43,880
Let's blow it down.

988
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:44,340
Whoa!

989
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,120
Where's the other briefcase man?

990
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,760
Hey, you guys want to have some fun, briefcase man?

991
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,080
You guys want to see a cool trick?

992
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,120
All right.

993
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:54,520
Wait a minute.

994
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,500
She flipped a car.

995
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,180
Hey, you guys want to...

996
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,280
You want to see a cool trick, man?

997
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,380
Boop.

998
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,600
Whoa.

999
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,340
Where did he go?

1000
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,620
Where did he go?

1001
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,780
And the wife never saw him since.

1002
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,180
Oh, my God.

1003
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:17,980
The wife is like, oh, he was supposed to come back like two days ago.

1004
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,940
I don't know what happened.

1005
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,780
Well, I don't know what happened too.

1006
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:23,800
All right.

1007
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,300
Let's see.

1008
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,060
We have to go.

1009
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:25,500
Oh, hey.

1010
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,020
Is that bread?

1011
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:26,760
Who's...

1012
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,740
What the fuck?

1013
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,700
My name is...

1014
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,520
Is this a developer?

1015
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,420
My name is Pit.

1016
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,480
Who the fuck are you?

1017
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,820
Can I grab you?

1018
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,160
What the fuck?

1019
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,240
What do I do with Pit?

1020
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,340
What do I do with you?

1021
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:45,980
Brad Pit?

1022
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,280
Is this Bread Pit?

1023
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,540
Is this...

1024
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:50,740
Okay.

1025
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,320
That's pretty good.

1026
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,100
Not gonna lie.

1027
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,400
All right.

1028
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,420
Goodbye, Bread Pit.

1029
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,080
Oh, hey.

1030
00:43:59,180 --> 00:43:59,740
Is this coffee?

1031
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,920
Oh, oh.

1032
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,620
I have unlimited.

1033
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,560
That's fucking right.

1034
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,200
Forever?

1035
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,460
Nice.

1036
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,140
Oh, shit.

1037
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,400
Sorry, that coffee was fucked up, man.

1038
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:16,360
Sorry.

1039
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,380
That coffee...

1040
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,680
That coffee did some things.

1041
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,020
Oh, a bus.

1042
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,480
I've always wanted to poop on a bus.

1043
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:25,640
Okay.

1044
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,460
Gotta make sure we got all the square foot area.

1045
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,000
Where am I?

1046
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,060
Croaky is a little lost.

1047
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,060
Oh, Croaky has to go this way.

1048
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:36,880
All right.

1049
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,260
Fuck off.

1050
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:38,820
Carl.

1051
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:40,180
Carl.

1052
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,540
Hello, Grandma.

1053
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,720
I got the key.

1054
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,840
Are you proud of me?

1055
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,100
All right.

1056
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:46,880
Let's see.

1057
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,360
Oh, I still need to blow away humans.

1058
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,780
I got so distracted with the key.

1059
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:53,880
Wait.

1060
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,660
Where did I...

1061
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,200
Where did I put the...

1062
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,780
Where did I put the leaf blower?

1063
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,100
Hello?

1064
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,800
My babies.

1065
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,460
My babies.

1066
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,740
They're gone.

1067
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,660
Disappeared.

1068
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,280
Removed.

1069
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,040
Unexisted.

1070
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,240
That's great.

1071
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,100
That's great, ma'am.

1072
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,340
Now you don't have to pay for more college tuitions.

1073
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,460
You're free now.

1074
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,860
Bro, I know what you are.

1075
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,060
You can just get kids in like two months.

1076
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,520
Probably just ran away like the little rascals they are.

1077
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,700
Couldn't have gone far.

1078
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,440
They must be somewhere around.

1079
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,880
Will you bring them back to me?

1080
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:31,580
All of them?

1081
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,000
Why would you want all of them?

1082
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,540
Wouldn't one be the best?

1083
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,920
I am mother.

1084
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,340
I need my babies.

1085
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:40,320
In like one to two months, you'll have more babies.

1086
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:41,760
Liz?

1087
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,120
I know what you are.

1088
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,760
More like weeks.

1089
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,240
That's true.

1090
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,000
Oh, you're right.

1091
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:50,940
She hungry.

1092
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,460
You're right.

1093
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,060
That's why she wants more.

1094
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:56,940
She...

1095
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,340
Oh, wait.

1096
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:57,920
What kind of...

1097
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,200
What kind of ammo did I got now?

1098
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,480
Oh, it's like a speed boost.

1099
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:01,960
Wee!

1100
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:06,700
Wee-oo!

1101
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,320
Oh!

1102
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,700
It's a fucking speed boost.

1103
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,000
All right.

1104
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,320
I need to find...

1105
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,960
What happened to my leaf blower though?

1106
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,240
Oh, so there's one of the babies.

1107
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,360
All right.

1108
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,640
Get over here.

1109
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:21,980
Where did I find bread pit?

1110
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,840
Was bread pit over here?

1111
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,380
Where the fuck did I found bread pit?

1112
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,480
Bro, bread pit is so old now.

1113
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,720
Here we go.

1114
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,160
All right.

1115
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,040
Oh, it's over here.

1116
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:36,640
No.

1117
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,280
That's the key.

1118
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:37,580
Wait.

1119
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,680
There was more than one key?

1120
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,460
Where the fuck did I found...

1121
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,040
Where's the leaf blower?

1122
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,040
Far left?

1123
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,440
Okay.

1124
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,000
It should be here around here.

1125
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,000
I beat up...

1126
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,780
I beat up one guy somewhere here.

1127
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:55,480
Wait.

1128
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,820
I hear one of the hammies or the squirrels.

1129
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:58,980
All right.

1130
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,500
Get over here.

1131
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,320
Oh, shit.

1132
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:00,620
Sorry.

1133
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:03,860
Sorry.

1134
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,420
It was reflex.

1135
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,440
All right.

1136
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:06,760
números.

1137
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,440
Feed your momma.

1138
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,880
Feed the weakest to the mom.

1139
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,160
That's why they eat the kids, by the way.

1140
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,780
It's cause they're like...

1141
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,360
They need the extra nutrients.

1142
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,900
Um, and it's either they're...

1143
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:30,060
as like the weakest out of all the babies so they're like, well, obviously we need to get rid of one of you, Because like there's no point in raising you to adulthood.

1144
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,560
So they eat the child.

1145
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,840
Yeah, only the strongest survive.

1146
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,360
Or boredom.

1147
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,580
Sometimes they're just bored.

1148
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,240
They're like, ooh.

1149
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,340
Protein.

1150
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,060
Yeah, so you better not be a weak squirrel.

1151
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:49,700
This is awesome.

1152
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,300
God damn it.

1153
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,540
Where did I put my leaf blower?

1154
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,820
Where did I park that thing?

1155
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,740
Guys, do you guys remember which parking lot?

1156
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,780
Guys, where did I park my leaf blower?

1157
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,220
Was it like, was it P3?

1158
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,560
Oh, it's here, it's here.

1159
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,140
I found it.

1160
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,340
Alright, it was P4.

1161
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:17,020
Guys, I told you to remember the parking lot number.

1162
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,780
You think I was gonna remember that?

1163
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,660
Alright, we need to find another briefcase guy.

1164
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,640
Please never go near... dude, where's my leaf blower?

1165
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:26,820
Dude, where's my car?

1166
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,980
Wait, who has, who has the suitcase?

1167
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:30,900
Hello?

1168
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,640
Oh, fuck, okay.

1169
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,440
Boom!

1170
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,480
Alright, did the thing.

1171
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,020
I still need a ball.

1172
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,600
And I need to find one more squirrel kid.

1173
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,560
Alright, I'm gonna park it here now.

1174
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:51,460
Guys, remember where the leaf blower was parked, guys?

1175
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,620
Fuck, where is he?

1176
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,520
Where is he?

1177
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,300
There's too many.

1178
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:57,680
There are way too many animals.

1179
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,560
There's way too many animals here.

1180
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,920
Okay, it should be like...

1181
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,300
Okay, maybe I do need the map.

1182
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:12,550
Where is he?

1183
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:14,450
Wait, is that a bull?

1184
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,090
That must be a bull, right?

1185
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,930
Oh my god, you think a door can stop me?

1186
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:20,990
That's fucking right.

1187
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,330
You ain't got the dog bull.

1188
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,050
That's fucking right.

1189
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:27,690
No dog bull for you.

1190
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:29,330
Okay, there you go.

1191
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:30,130
I got the swag.

1192
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:31,890
I got the swag, Ms. Peacock!

1193
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:33,650
I did it!

1194
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:36,650
Oh, okay, she doesn't want to talk to me.

1195
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:37,230
That's fine.

1196
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,530
I didn't want to talk to you either.

1197
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:40,390
On the conbini?

1198
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:42,530
Is that the conbini?

1199
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:45,450
No.

1200
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:46,250
Oh, that is!

1201
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:46,730
That is!

1202
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:47,970
No, that's the brother!

1203
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:51,150
Help!

1204
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,270
Those humans have taken over my home!

1205
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:55,770
My beautiful park!

1206
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,250
How dare they!

1207
00:49:57,690 --> 00:49:58,790
They think...

1208
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:06,170
That land was owned by his great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grand hog.

1209
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:07,710
How dare they!

1210
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:09,510
I bet they don't even have a permit.

1211
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:12,570
It appears they're having some kind of devilish ritual.

1212
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:17,350
Please, please do what is your power to ruin it!

1213
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:19,590
Alright, don't worry, I got you.

1214
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:22,010
Let me grab...

1215
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,270
Let me grab this coffee real quick.

1216
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:24,850
I...

1217
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:27,870
Don't worry.

1218
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,230
Oh shit!

1219
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:30,970
Don't worry.

1220
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,790
Nothing can stop me now.

1221
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,430
The children aren't even safe.

1222
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:38,890
Oh, I gotta pop balloons.

1223
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:42,210
That's right.

1224
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,410
Fuck you, kids.

1225
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,970
You don't deserve happiness.

1226
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:53,970
If I'm not happy, you're not happy.

1227
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:57,270
Leave!

1228
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:58,870
Oh, destroy the radio?

1229
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,330
And also, fuck music too!

1230
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:03,310
No more music!

1231
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,390
How do I destroy music?

1232
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:10,790
That's right!

1233
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:12,990
What's this?

1234
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:13,730
Oh, Shiny!

1235
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,750
Wait, how do I... Oh, I didn't pop all the balloons.

1236
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:17,450
Give me a sec.

1237
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:19,550
Sorry, I almost forgot to pop all the balloons.

1238
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:20,930
Don't you dare run away.

1239
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:22,770
Alright.

1240
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:23,470
Oh, I know.

1241
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:25,710
That's fucking right.

1242
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,110
Music is now banned!

1243
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:31,270
Boom!

1244
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,670
Oh, you wonderful fiend.

1245
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:35,830
You've done it!

1246
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:38,730
Thank you so much!

1247
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:41,450
Another small step towards complete animal domination.

1248
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:43,990
Yeah!

1249
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:44,790
Yippee!

1250
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,150
Alright, I did my job.

1251
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:52,530
Traumatize the child.

1252
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,070
Abandon these parts.

1253
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,090
This is croaky territory.

1254
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:00,050
Alright.

1255
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:02,550
I am completing the circle.

1256
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:06,570
If I got bullied by the other crows...

1257
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:07,310
I'm...

1258
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:12,650
I just need to find somebody smaller than me.

1259
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,610
And continue the cycle.

1260
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:19,790
Hey!

1261
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:20,630
Croaky!

1262
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:21,770
How's it going?

1263
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:22,010
Play with me.

1264
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:22,310
You can go with me!

1265
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:24,910
Call me!

1266
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:25,310
Let me!

1267
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:26,210
Let me the lemur!

1268
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:28,230
You're...

1269
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:28,330
Yes, I am.

1270
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:29,650
You like, like, one smart bird.

1271
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:30,050
Eh?

1272
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:32,050
You!

1273
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:33,550
Ohh!

1274
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:34,170
Croaky doing quests.

1275
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:35,550
Let's pop- Oh, Shiny.

1276
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:36,410
Hahaha!

1277
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,990
Mirka, thank you for the super chat.

1278
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:39,370
Thank you!

1279
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,970
But you're smart enough to use tools, aren't you?

1280
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:43,690
Yeah!

1281
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,890
I'm pretty smart.

1282
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:49,410
My crow goons say I'm smart before they take my lunch money and my sunglasses.

1283
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:51,150
So?

1284
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:53,010
Some objects you pick up have a special use.

1285
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:54,750
How about we practice your usability?

1286
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,550
Me and the boys were talking.

1287
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,830
These humans getting mad wild in our turf.

1288
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:00,950
You know what I'm saying?

1289
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,490
Guess it's time to remind them who runs this place.

1290
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:11,090
Grab one of the spray cans and tag a bunch of red mailboxes.

1291
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:12,390
Just like the one right here.

1292
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:13,450
Thou teach them!

1293
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,210
I'm gonna start tagging.

1294
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:19,410
Oh my god.

1295
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:20,530
Thou teach them!

1296
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:22,890
I'm gonna tag the place.

1297
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:26,110
It's all about personal branding, you dig?

1298
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:27,950
Not graffiti.

1299
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:29,610
Oh no!

1300
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:30,970
Croaky!

1301
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,430
You're not doing graffiti!

1302
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:38,010
Oh god.

1303
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:40,210
Croaky is so... I'm so bad.

1304
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:42,270
Oh my god.

1305
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:47,370
I'm so bad, guys.

1306
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:51,190
That's right.

1307
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:53,150
Graffiti hours.

1308
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:57,090
It's time for crime.

1309
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:01,870
Alright, we gotta find some more mailboxes.

1310
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:02,530
Oh, there's more here.

1311
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:04,150
Oh my god.

1312
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:08,770
Imagine how much money the government has to spend to clean my graffiti.

1313
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:13,490
Oh, what a punk.

1314
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:15,750
This is croaky turf now.

1315
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:18,710
Alright.

1316
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:22,410
I got my... I got my tags in.

1317
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:24,030
I'm the next Banksy.

1318
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:24,790
Croaky.

1319
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:26,290
Okay.

1320
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:28,290
Let's see.

1321
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,100
Croaky, croaky, my bird!

1322
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,540
You have done us a solid!

1323
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,740
Now these pesky humans won't forget we own this place.

1324
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,480
Good work!

1325
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:42,840
Ayyyy!

1326
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:45,520
Alright, nice.

1327
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,400
Alright, uh...

1328
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,820
Where do I have to go?

1329
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,760
Where the fuck is that other hedgehog?

1330
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:51,740
Is it here?

1331
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,520
It should be here.

1332
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:54,760
No, that's the mom.

1333
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,060
I'm still like...

1334
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:58,800
Oh, I already...

1335
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,480
Oh, because I finished it!

1336
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,140
So, like, I don't have to...

1337
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,960
I don't have to, like, talk to him again.

1338
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,520
That's why.

1339
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,100
What if I spring paint a human?

1340
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,500
You stupid humans don't know what hits them.

1341
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:12,980
Yeah, that's right.

1342
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,560
That's right.

1343
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,040
Consume that toxic fume.

1344
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:16,960
That's right.

1345
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,240
That's right.

1346
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,420
You're not wearing a mask.

1347
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,500
Oh, you're in...

1348
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,420
Your poor lungs.

1349
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,060
Ooh.

1350
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,460
You're getting pink fumes now.

1351
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,560
That's right.

1352
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,040
You're gonna get something very bad.

1353
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,420
That's right.

1354
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:33,940
Alright.

1355
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,860
Witness me.

1356
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,120
Oh, hey, there's another child.

1357
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,380
Alright, get over here.

1358
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,660
What if I just drop you from high?

1359
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:45,880
You okay there, buddy?

1360
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,700
Are you okay?

1361
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:51,780
Are you okay?

1362
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,180
What about the child?

1363
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,800
What about the child?

1364
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,160
Grookey, no!

1365
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,420
He's gonna get eaten anyway!

1366
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,440
It doesn't matter!

1367
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:06,680
Ow!

1368
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,540
Alright, here you go.

1369
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,340
Here's your kids.

1370
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,600
My babies are all home!

1371
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,740
Thank you, bird.

1372
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:16,940
Come here!

1373
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:19,780
Alright,

1374
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,760
I did it.

1375
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:27,300
Yeah, I'm just tenderizing it for the mom.

1376
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,300
Making sure the meat is nice and tender for her.

1377
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:39,680
One of my old friends, back in middle school, she used to own hamsters.

1378
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:46,780
And then the hamster she got, because she bought the hamster online, and then she didn't know it was pregnant.

1379
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:50,140
So one day, there was just suddenly babies.

1380
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:53,420
But then the mom started eating the babies.

1381
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,620
And the mom ate the one...

1382
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:02,280
Before she could eat the baby, the mom ate its legs.

1383
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,920
And I was like, what the fuck?

1384
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,900
That was the first time I found out.

1385
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,800
I basically got trauma in middle school.

1386
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,180
And found out that hamsters eat their kids.

1387
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,560
Because of my friend.

1388
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:17,200
She had more trauma because she had to watch it happen.

1389
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,520
But yeah, I was like, oh my god, the mom ate the foot?

1390
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,860
And she was like, yeah, it ate the foot.

1391
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:23,960
And I was like, what the fuck?

1392
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,760
I was like...

1393
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:32,100
And that's how I learned about animal cannibalism.

1394
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:36,060
I was like, but poor me, I had to hear the story.

1395
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,900
I was like, my friend had to watch it happen.

1396
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,660
But poor me, I had to listen to that story.

1397
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,820
I had to go through the story.

1398
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,440
Squee!

1399
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,160
There's a big fat cat down below.

1400
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,060
And he wants to eat us.

1401
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,680
I mean, you are looking juicy.

1402
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,980
Help, croaky, help!

1403
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,200
I met this fat cat.

1404
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,620
I would love some fish as well.

1405
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,720
Drop some fish near him and he'll be sure to follow.

1406
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,800
Oh my god, that looks like some juicy little rats there.

1407
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:21,980
Hello, little rats.

1408
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,540
There should be a leaky pipe on one of the buildings near us.

1409
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,040
Lead the cat to get splashed and he'll be sure to scram.

1410
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,180
Save us!

1411
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:31,760
Squee!

1412
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,800
I mean, look at it.

1413
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,320
They're like little...

1414
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,860
They're like little nerds.

1415
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:39,480
You know?

1416
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,740
They're like M&Ms.

1417
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,480
Alright, where the fuck is the cat?

1418
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,000
Alright, there's the cat.

1419
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,280
Alright, cat, follow me.

1420
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,480
Cat!

1421
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,220
Cat, come on!

1422
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,480
I have fish!

1423
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:03,580
Alright.

1424
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:04,820
Where's the pipe?

1425
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,780
There's apparently a leaky pipe somewhere.

1426
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,300
Alright.

1427
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,020
There you go.

1428
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,860
Where is it?

1429
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,000
Meow.

1430
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,820
So there's a leaky pipe somewhere.

1431
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,620
Where the fuck is the leaky pipe?

1432
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:27,300
Hello?

1433
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,060
They all look the same.

1434
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,080
Oh, there it is!

1435
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:34,600
Okay.

1436
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,880
Alright, get over here, cat.

1437
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,960
Get over here.

1438
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,760
Why can't you talk to me?

1439
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,520
Are like...

1440
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,320
Do predators not like...

1441
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,220
Cannot...

1442
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,440
Do predator and prey have like different...

1443
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,200
Well, to be fair, I'm a predator too.

1444
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:50,960
But like...

1445
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,740
I guess like I'm not...

1446
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,760
Well, I could technically be a predator.

1447
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:57,940
But like...

1448
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:59,560
Is this like Zootopia?

1449
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:04,700
Are we like discriminating against the predator...

1450
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,740
Predator animals?

1451
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,700
Are they like too stupid to understand us?

1452
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,460
I mean, look at him.

1453
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:12,460
He looks too stupid.

1454
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,540
Alright, look at this.

1455
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:14,700
Yeah, I know.

1456
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,640
He's definitely stupid.

1457
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:17,340
He's...

1458
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,260
You know...

1459
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:18,740
Oh, shit.

1460
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:19,040
Okay.

1461
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,500
I need to grab...

1462
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:20,940
Oh, sorry.

1463
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:21,820
I got too...

1464
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:22,840
Oh, I got so excited.

1465
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:23,980
I'm so excited right now.

1466
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:27,700
Alright.

1467
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,160
I need to grab more fish.

1468
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,360
No, I need to grab more fish!

1469
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:32,580
There you go.

1470
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:35,820
Alright, get over here.

1471
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,180
You're gonna get wet now.

1472
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:40,940
Look at this stupid cat.

1473
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,440
Alright, we did it.

1474
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,540
Alright, mice.

1475
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,400
I did it.

1476
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,000
Ha!

1477
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,100
Thank you for the super chat.

1478
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:51,380
Thank you.

1479
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,900
Many asked me to voice his inner thoughts for him.

1480
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:00,180
Squee!

1481
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,480
You lured the ugly cat away!

1482
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:06,140
Thank you, Crowy.

1483
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:06,800
Thank you!

1484
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,440
Kaka!

1485
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,480
Another job well done for Crowkey.

1486
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:13,540
Kaka!

1487
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,120
Alright.

1488
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:16,580
Whoops.

1489
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:18,340
Alright.

1490
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,880
Sorry, I got really excited when I got the job well done.

1491
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,360
Hello!

1492
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,160
Hello, Ponyhawk!

1493
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,380
Hola, Crow!

1494
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,580
Are you practicing your swoops to move faster like I showed you?

1495
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,320
I know it feels hard, but think how good it would be if you want to get a hang of it.

1496
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:35,260
Anyway, I think it's time to...

1497
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:36,520
No, not races!

1498
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,540
I'm so bad!

1499
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,780
This is like the Spyro PTSD right now.

1500
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,160
I hated the Spyro races.

1501
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:44,520
Um...

1502
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,320
It'll activate a special race mode.

1503
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,360
Just land on it and squawk to activate.

1504
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:52,000
Then fly all the checkpoints that appear as fast as you can.

1505
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:56,780
Find all the races in the world and complete them for much, much fun.

1506
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,580
Every race you complete will increase your computation.

1507
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:07,200
If you're struggling or want an extra challenge, you can always change the race difficulty.

1508
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,360
Just pause the game and go to settings...

1509
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:09,760
Wait, really?

1510
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:10,600
Alright.

1511
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,120
No, wait.

1512
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:12,700
Give me...

1513
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:15,860
Wait.

1514
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,180
Nobody likes races, guys!

1515
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:20,780
Nobody likes it anyway.

1516
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,240
Oh my god, I'm going...

1517
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,100
Guys, I did hard difficulty, by the way.

1518
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:32,500
Yay!

1519
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:33,900
Wait, I'll...

1520
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,640
I guess, like, can I just walk out?

1521
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:36,020
Walk?

1522
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,440
If it's easy?

1523
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:38,540
Like...

1524
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:40,360
Yay...

1525
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,480
I'm so good!

1526
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:42,660
I'm so good!

1527
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:44,980
Yay!

1528
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,160
It'll be fine!

1529
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,160
We don't even need to fly!

1530
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,600
Like, literally, like, 60 seconds?

1531
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,420
There's something wrong with this bird.

1532
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,720
Oh my god.

1533
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,500
This is so easy.

1534
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:05,360
Wait, no!

1535
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:06,540
I have to fly!

1536
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:09,480
Okay, now back to...

1537
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,620
Back to the leisurely walk.

1538
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,060
Okay, now back to...

1539
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,980
Wait, am I going to get second place?

1540
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:15,960
Oh my god!

1541
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,180
Guys, I got second!

1542
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:21,700
Yippee!

1543
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,040
This bird has issues.

1544
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:30,220
Alright, let's get at least first.

1545
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,360
Oh my god!

1546
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,100
I'm so good, guys!

1547
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,940
Oh my god!

1548
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,540
I'm so good at races!

1549
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,080
You see?

1550
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:43,740
This is the easiest race of my life.

1551
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:47,360
Oh my god.

1552
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:51,140
Guys, I'm on the hardest difficulty when it comes to racing.

1553
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:52,460
By the way.

1554
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:57,260
Wait, it doesn't even matter.

1555
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,780
I just need to complete it.

1556
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,400
It doesn't even matter.

1557
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,680
As long as I complete it, I get the same amount of points.

1558
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,120
I'm so good.

1559
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:08,160
Alright, I did it.

1560
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,000
I did it, grandma!

1561
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:10,960
Oh shit, sorry.

1562
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:12,560
I did it, grandma!

1563
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,620
Gamer, thank you for the super chat.

1564
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:16,940
Thank you.

1565
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:17,560
Thank you.

1566
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,420
Hi Dookie, I love your vibe.

1567
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,100
Thank you!

1568
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,040
Thank you for the super chat.

1569
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:24,100
Wait, I'm missing?

1570
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:26,420
Oh, it's the races.

1571
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,300
There's like a hundred million of them.

1572
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:28,820
Oh!

1573
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:30,900
I didn't want that samurai hat anyway.

1574
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,040
I didn't even want that.

1575
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:35,680
I don't want to be a samurai.

1576
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,140
I'm a fucking bird.

1577
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:37,640
Whoa!

1578
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:39,940
Wait up, squib!

1579
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:45,140
So, you're that new crow everyone's talking about.

1580
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,100
They're talking about me?

1581
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,380
Me?

1582
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,040
I'm getting popular?

1583
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,220
I'm all about popular.

1584
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,960
Thought you'd be bigger.

1585
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:58,280
Hey!

1586
01:04:58,840 --> 01:04:59,320
Hey!

1587
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:00,540
Hey!

1588
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,720
I'm a short crow.

1589
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:04,040
I'm a short king.

1590
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:08,520
Anyway, you must think you're like the protagonist of this adventure, huh?

1591
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:09,440
Yeah.

1592
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,660
Well, let me introduce myself.

1593
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,940
I am Maggie the magpie.

1594
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,860
The smartest of all birds.

1595
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:20,540
Everyone knows magpies are smart.

1596
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:20,900
What?

1597
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:21,960
That is not true!

1598
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,540
That cannot be true!

1599
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,500
Where's your sunglasses?

1600
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:27,260
I don't have sunglasses right now.

1601
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,300
I left it at home.

1602
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:33,440
Thus henceforth, let it be known this is just magpie things.

1603
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,020
And you?

1604
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,160
You're just an...

1605
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:36,500
What?

1606
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:39,560
So, watch your back crow.

1607
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:40,940
I'll beat you every step.

1608
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:41,520
Through every step of the way.

1609
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,680
Whack, Whack-a-whack.

1610
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,160
Whack-a-whack-a-whack.

1611
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:46,760
Yes, that's right.

1612
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:47,660
Real birds.

1613
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,280
Whack.

1614
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,100
Only...

1615
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:50,440
I'm not a loser!

1616
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,900
My grandma says I'm cool...

1617
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:05,970
My grandma says I'm cool...

1618
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:12,980
I'm not a loser, right, crocoons?

1619
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,920
I'm not a loser.

1620
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:22,620
What does this hat look like?

1621
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,440
What the fuck?

1622
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:26,040
Okay, I don't think I like that.

1623
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:29,100
No, you don't have your sunglasses.

1624
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:33,860
I don't need... do you see that cute backpack I have?

1625
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:35,840
I don't need sunglasses.

1626
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,500
Look at this cute backpack.

1627
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:40,760
I'm on an adventure.

1628
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,060
I'm on an adventure.

1629
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,840
Wait, the masks have stats?

1630
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,220
Wait, did they really?

1631
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:48,380
I thought they were just customization.

1632
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,160
Okay, cute little enable with the spirit improves your...

1633
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,040
No, it doesn't.

1634
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:54,780
What the fuck?

1635
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,240
Improves your cunning?

1636
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:57,700
I don't need improvement.

1637
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,800
I'm already smart.

1638
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,320
Alright, nice.

1639
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:01,440
We're going to ancient Egypt.

1640
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:03,960
Backpack oven.

1641
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,500
Is this why they took my lunch money?

1642
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,180
The humans used to worship us.

1643
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:10,740
Alright, we're back.

1644
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,320
We somehow flew to Egypt, guys.

1645
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,820
But lately, they've become very lazy.

1646
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:21,320
What's the last time anyone gave your chin a scritch?

1647
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:28,500
What was the last time someone moved a little string around to amuse you?

1648
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,660
The Pharaoh's headdress is a symbol of power around here.

1649
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:34,080
Bring me the Pharaoh's headdress.

1650
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:38,620
Whoever brings me the Pharaoh's headdress will be handsomely rewarded.

1651
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,820
It is time to restore power to cats.

1652
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:44,920
I don't think they know.

1653
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,320
They'll never know that I'm not actually a cat.

1654
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:54,940
Guys, I can't believe...

1655
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,940
Guys, did you guys know Egypt is like right next to Japan?

1656
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,620
Alright, let's go.

1657
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,740
I bet you guys didn't know that.

1658
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,500
Holy shit, is that a shiny?

1659
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:13,300
Really?

1660
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,500
Yeah, it's right.

1661
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:16,420
Video games don't lie to you.

1662
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:19,560
Of course.

1663
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:26,260
If the video game that says that Japan is just next to Egypt, then I trust it.

1664
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,340
It has a crow.

1665
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:31,120
I'm meant to be a strong, magnificent idol.

1666
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:35,120
The lady here, she does not understand the importance of protein.

1667
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,240
She feeds me melon and now I'm soft round.

1668
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,520
Bring me fish from the market.

1669
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,940
In return, you'll gaze upon my glistening muscles.

1670
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:48,120
Oh yeah, don't feed... don't make your cat vegan.

1671
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,660
They can actually get sick, by the way.

1672
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:52,500
Alright.

1673
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,760
Like, cats are not meant to be vegan.

1674
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,780
Alright, let's grab that fish.

1675
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,200
Ah, I can't grab it.

1676
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,080
They're so bouncy.

1677
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,600
Alright, cat.

1678
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:06,160
Here's a fish.

1679
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:09,960
Finally.

1680
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:14,200
Finally, I have returned to my true form.

1681
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:20,020
Look upon my enormous muscles.

1682
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,320
Damn.

1683
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,520
Do you want to touch them?

1684
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,420
You may.

1685
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,420
Be not afraid.

1686
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,760
Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

1687
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:34,960
Pew!

1688
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:38,240
Not the headdress.

1689
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:39,840
Okay, we can't do that yet.

1690
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,640
Alright.

1691
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:42,020
Where does the pharaoh live?

1692
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,780
Does Egypt still have pharaohs?

1693
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,240
No, right?

1694
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:48,120
Oh my god.

1695
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,240
Being croaky actually made me dumber.

1696
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:53,180
I'm like, no, of course not.

1697
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,500
Pharaohs don't exist anymore.

1698
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:55,260
What am I saying?

1699
01:09:56,740 --> 01:10:00,960
No, but if the game says that pharaohs exist, then it should be true.

1700
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,600
Because this game... this game wouldn't lie to me.

1701
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:06,900
This game wouldn't lie to me, chat.

1702
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:14,390
My friend, you look like you appreciate the finer things.

1703
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:15,850
In life, no.

1704
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:20,270
Help me with my little business and you'll have everything you could ever dream of.

1705
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:23,830
During the day, I sell jewels to discerning buyers.

1706
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:26,150
And at night, I steal them back.

1707
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:28,090
She's a cat burglar.

1708
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:29,270
What do you say?

1709
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:30,050
Wanna be pals?

1710
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:32,410
Only if I get like a 50-50 cut.

1711
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:36,710
We can be business partners after that.

1712
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:38,710
Alright.

1713
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:40,110
Let's see.

1714
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:41,150
Where did I leave my jewel?

1715
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:42,010
Oh, there it is.

1716
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:42,610
Alright.

1717
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:43,370
Yoink.

1718
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:44,790
There's five?

1719
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:45,570
Damn.

1720
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:47,950
There's five jewels.

1721
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:50,330
Alright, let's...

1722
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:52,590
Wouldn't it be easier to just 3D print some jewels?

1723
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:55,010
Nice.

1724
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:55,270
Alright.

1725
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:56,590
Where else?

1726
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:58,270
Where are the other jewels?

1727
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:00,590
I don't wanna do any of the races, not gonna lie.

1728
01:11:00,850 --> 01:11:02,550
The races sound like hell.

1729
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:07,030
The races sound like they suck.

1730
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:10,090
It just gives me a spiral piece.

1731
01:11:10,110 --> 01:11:12,730
I'm a bit of a PTSD because I fucking hated the races there.

1732
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:17,110
But I needed to do them to unlock areas.

1733
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:22,350
Somebody had the nerve to put my goats in a pen.

1734
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:26,270
Break them free and lead them into the market.

1735
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,390
Take this funny looking tool thing.

1736
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:30,570
The goats like the noises it makes.

1737
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:31,070
Oh!

1738
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:33,690
I'm like a snake charmer but for goats.

1739
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:35,270
What can I not do?

1740
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:39,430
I have the... I'm like that guy with a million jobs.

1741
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:40,830
Oh shit, sorry.

1742
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:41,790
Whoops.

1743
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:44,790
No, I can't grab it!

1744
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:47,210
Get over here, goats!

1745
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:49,310
Get over here!

1746
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:51,730
That's looking right!

1747
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:54,210
That's looking right!

1748
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:55,210
Storm the gates!

1749
01:11:57,530 --> 01:11:58,170
That's right!

1750
01:11:58,350 --> 01:11:59,530
Storm the gates!

1751
01:11:59,730 --> 01:11:59,870
Oh!

1752
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:02,350
No, my... No!

1753
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:04,270
My beautiful musical instrument!

1754
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:05,470
Alright.

1755
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:06,710
Can't get me.

1756
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:08,230
That's right!

1757
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:11,030
Wait, where is the cat?

1758
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:11,650
This way.

1759
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:12,650
Oh, the market.

1760
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:13,610
Get over here!

1761
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:15,230
Follow the leader!

1762
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:17,630
Drown!

1763
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:18,510
Humans!

1764
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:20,970
Freedom!

1765
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:29,380
You shall not be chained by the pesky meatbags!

1766
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:32,080
That's right!

1767
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,820
Storm the markets!

1768
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:35,800
Alright, sorry.

1769
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:36,720
My job's done.

1770
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:38,420
Yay!

1771
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,000
Alright.

1772
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,480
What else do I have to do?

1773
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:44,940
Okay, we gotta find the jewelry.

1774
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,380
Where is some more jewelry?

1775
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:49,580
Wait, what's this?

1776
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,060
It's a melon.

1777
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:51,240
Do I get to go big?

1778
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,180
Like the other cat?

1779
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,060
Oh, no.

1780
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,160
It's just regular food.

1781
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,560
Oh, there's another cat!

1782
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:57,660
Hello, other cat!

1783
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:00,080
Hey!

1784
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:04,740
It'd be a shame if the market was covered in weird frogs.

1785
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,560
What a shame, indeed.

1786
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:12,260
Yeah, it'd be a shame if someone with wings grabbed a frog and put it in a cloud.

1787
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,500
Oh my god.

1788
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:15,040
Am I a bad crow?

1789
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:20,020
Am I getting influ- Am I in like, the bad parts of town?

1790
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,060
This is what my grandma said.

1791
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:28,200
It only takes one bad turn.

1792
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,820
Who would do such a thing?

1793
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:38,660
Oh, but remember the frogs only come out at night.

1794
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,400
Wait, how does it turn nighttime?

1795
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,780
How do I make it nighttime then?

1796
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,240
With shit on you.

1797
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,540
That's fucking right.

1798
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,300
That's right, learn your lesson.

1799
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:58,300
We could have done this the nice way, but you had to bring- You have to bring in the big guns there.

1800
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,140
Wait, what's this?

1801
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,060
Oh, it's a race.

1802
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,580
Okay, let's see.

1803
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,780
Put frogs- Frogs only- How do I make it nighttime?

1804
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:09,500
I don't know how to make it nighttime.

1805
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:11,560
I don't control the fucking weather.

1806
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:15,620
Do not eat the colorful fruit.

1807
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:19,760
It will give you the most horrible, shameful, stinky poops.

1808
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:20,840
Uh oh, stinky.

1809
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:26,760
Poops are so cursed, even a single web will send someone into delirium.

1810
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,420
I've seen even the most fearsome warriors run for the hills.

1811
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:34,800
Seriously, for everyone's safety, do not eat those.

1812
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:35,700
I'm gonna eat it.

1813
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:37,540
Oh, no!

1814
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:40,940
No!

1815
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:45,060
I'm not happy now.

1816
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:48,280
I'm gonna eat it now.

1817
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:48,820
Yummy.

1818
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,340
Okay, I did the- There you go.

1819
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:53,080
Wait, that's it?

1820
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:55,120
That's fucking it?

1821
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,140
It doesn't even do anything special.

1822
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,940
It's just my regular, regular time.

1823
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,660
How do I turn it into night?

1824
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,100
I still don't know how to turn it into night.

1825
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,620
Okay, that's the cat that wants me to steal the pharaohs.

1826
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:13,700
Oh, there's the magpie.

1827
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:14,840
There's the bitch.

1828
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,080
Alright, hello.

1829
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:20,620
You're too late, croaky.

1830
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:25,140
I already hit the magical lantern past those tornadoes.

1831
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:27,540
What is the mag- Oh, it turns into night!

1832
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:30,240
Guess you'll just never know.

1833
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,000
Squeak!

1834
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:35,620
Oh, the yellow- Oh, the fruits on the trees?

1835
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:36,160
Oh!

1836
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:38,780
Oops, sorry.

1837
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:42,640
Oh, these fruits!

1838
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,600
Okay, so this?

1839
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:48,700
Ah!

1840
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:52,940
Let the crow eat!

1841
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:55,360
Let the crow eat!

1842
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,760
Alright, I did it.

1843
01:15:58,840 --> 01:15:59,400
What does it do?

1844
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:02,620
Oh!

1845
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:05,660
Oh!

1846
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:10,940
I made that.

1847
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,820
Okay, apparently we gotta find the...

1848
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:24,220
Oh!

1849
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,480
Oh, it makes me fly higher!

1850
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,020
Oh no, it sends you back in the beginning.

1851
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:29,940
Never mind.

1852
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,060
That's a strong tornado.

1853
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:37,560
But then, like, but they always say, if you go in the middle of the tornado, you'll be safe.

1854
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:40,080
Alright.

1855
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:40,340
Woo!

1856
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:42,820
Don't worry, I'm safe.

1857
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:44,100
Is that it?

1858
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,520
Oh, I don't have a key?

1859
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:48,760
Hello?

1860
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:53,340
I trapped the sun in this lantern to teach the humans a lesson.

1861
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,040
But they don't even care!

1862
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:56,980
Here, you can have it.

1863
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,960
Be careful not to drop it too low on the ground, or else...

1864
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:00,920
What's gonna happen?

1865
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:04,860
Oh!

1866
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:07,340
If I drop it, it turns into night.

1867
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,320
I see.

1868
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:12,240
Oh, it has to be like...

1869
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:12,560
Oh!

1870
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:14,680
Whoops, goodbye.

1871
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:16,260
Whee!

1872
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,260
Fast travel.

1873
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,160
Yay!

1874
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:21,980
Okay.

1875
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:25,140
If it's not the ground, then the frogs come out.

1876
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:26,980
Where the fuck are the frogs?

1877
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:31,080
The fucking goats.

1878
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:32,920
Where are the frogs at?

1879
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,520
Where do they go?

1880
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:37,420
Oh, there they are!

1881
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,140
Hello, little froggies.

1882
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,280
We're gonna start a plague.

1883
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,880
Where's the clouds, though?

1884
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:48,960
What do clouds look like?

1885
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:51,360
Wait, but...

1886
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,580
What do clouds look like?

1887
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:55,800
I don't know what clouds look like.

1888
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,000
Does the clouds have to be...

1889
01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,960
Oh no, they disappear!

1890
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:01,580
No!

1891
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:08,050
Where the fuck do clouds look like?

1892
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:10,370
I've never seen a cloud before.

1893
01:18:11,790 --> 01:18:14,050
Look, I'm like one years old, apparently.

1894
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:18,730
On the sky to the left?

1895
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:22,510
Oh, there it is!

1896
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:25,450
No!

1897
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:25,990
No!

1898
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:26,990
My frog!

1899
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:29,610
I thought that was clouds!

1900
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:33,190
No!

1901
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:36,050
My frog!

1902
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:42,430
But they look like clouds!

1903
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:45,710
Where the fuck are clouds?

1904
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:48,830
He died for nothing.

1905
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:50,190
He's a fucking frog.

1906
01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:52,310
Frogs can swim.

1907
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:55,110
They play at the market?

1908
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:57,270
Oh, there they are!

1909
01:18:57,470 --> 01:18:58,050
I see it!

1910
01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:00,210
Oh my god, that's what clouds are.

1911
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:01,610
My first time seeing a cloud.

1912
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:05,290
I am traveling around the world.

1913
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:06,430
I am traveling around the world.

1914
01:19:06,430 --> 01:19:06,430
Alright.

1915
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:07,950
There you go.

1916
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:10,310
There's one frog.

1917
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:11,770
I need five?

1918
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:13,410
Wait, when did I put four?

1919
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:14,850
Oh wait, no.

1920
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:15,190
Okay.

1921
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:16,510
I need to put four.

1922
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:17,050
Alright.

1923
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:18,010
One frog.

1924
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:19,910
Time to start a plague.

1925
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:20,030
Hey!

1926
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:23,250
This is what no god would have wanted.

1927
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:26,990
Alright.

1928
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:29,770
Get over here.

1929
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:32,390
God wanted this.

1930
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:33,630
Alright.

1931
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:36,070
Two!

1932
01:19:36,150 --> 01:19:37,090
Or three!

1933
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:41,530
And then we need...

1934
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:43,150
We need one more.

1935
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:44,250
Alright.

1936
01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:45,430
You're the chosen one.

1937
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:47,330
Ah!

1938
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:47,990
Gah!

1939
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:49,430
Gah!

1940
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:53,150
Wait, where the fuck is the last cloud?

1941
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:55,170
One.

1942
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:55,690
Two.

1943
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:56,750
Three.

1944
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:58,030
Oh, there it is!

1945
01:19:58,490 --> 01:20:00,290
I did it!

1946
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:03,230
I started a plague!

1947
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:07,790
Yay!

1948
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:11,510
Billions are gonna die now!

1949
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:13,710
Holy shit!

1950
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:14,690
Holy...

1951
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:17,110
That's a lot of frogs.

1952
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:19,370
Oh, that's a lot.

1953
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:20,450
Did I overdo it?

1954
01:20:20,570 --> 01:20:20,870
Nah.

1955
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:23,350
Alright, let's see.

1956
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:28,230
Still need to find, like, three more diamonds somewhere.

1957
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:30,910
Wait.

1958
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:32,030
The Pharaoh must live here.

1959
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:33,490
Oh!

1960
01:20:33,490 --> 01:20:33,970
Oh!

1961
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:34,530
Ow.

1962
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:36,730
I got tree blocked.

1963
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:39,450
This is what god wanted.

1964
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:40,530
Meow.

1965
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:41,310
Meow.

1966
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:45,410
Oh, you know, there's some good stuff in that cave.

1967
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:45,750
That temple.

1968
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:46,550
There is?

1969
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:56,550
Look at this place and tell me there isn't loads of shiny trinkets inside.

1970
01:20:57,570 --> 01:20:59,790
But there's some kind of puzzle on the door.

1971
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:02,390
Can you figure it out, Crogi?

1972
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:04,490
I mean, I already have.

1973
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:06,810
Obviously, because I am so smart.

1974
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:08,510
But...

1975
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:09,370
What?

1976
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:11,710
I will wait for you to figure it out.

1977
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:14,510
So you can learn too and be as smart as me one day.

1978
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:16,170
Shiny?

1979
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:16,530
I mean...

1980
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,080
Alright, let's...

1981
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,680
I think we need the lantern, right?

1982
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:28,400
Where do I put the lantern?

1983
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:30,680
Alright, we gotta grab the lantern.

1984
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,160
Where do I put it?

1985
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:37,400
Where do I put my insurance?

1986
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:38,580
Oh, there it is.

1987
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:40,600
Alright.

1988
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,320
Get over here.

1989
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:46,060
Oh, I hear it.

1990
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,220
I hear the door close.

1991
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,260
Down, up.

1992
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:53,320
Down, up.

1993
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:53,800
Alright.

1994
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,620
I need to put it down.

1995
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:56,820
All the way down.

1996
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:57,320
Down!

1997
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,480
Yay!

1998
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:02,980
Oh my god!

1999
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,320
I can't fly higher!

2000
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:05,960
Wait!

2001
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,280
But it's night time!

2002
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:11,060
I can't fly higher!

2003
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:13,220
Ow!

2004
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:15,940
I can't!

2005
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:18,140
I don't know how to fly high!

2006
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,340
Oh, I have to time it?

2007
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:21,620
Oh!

2008
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:23,260
Okay.

2009
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:26,360
Oh!

2010
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,140
Wait, that's fucked!

2011
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:28,700
Okay.

2012
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,440
Get down!

2013
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:33,880
Woah, woah, woah!

2014
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,100
I did it!

2015
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:37,960
Nice!

2016
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,460
Oh, look at all these treasures!

2017
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:41,000
You poor soul.

2018
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:42,840
So much Shiny!

2019
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:46,280
There's no treasure here.

2020
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:50,780
All your finest skeletons of fools like me got lured into the tomb.

2021
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,920
And soon you'll be one of us.

2022
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,100
There's no way out.

2023
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,380
But... but there's Shiny!

2024
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,240
There is no escape from the tomb.

2025
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:01,120
There is no escape from the tomb.

2026
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:02,740
But this is Shiny.

2027
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:04,740
There's no way.

2028
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:06,900
Oh my god, I'm fucking strong as hell.

2029
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:09,560
Maybe I have to put this?

2030
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:10,420
Oh, okay.

2031
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:12,460
That skeleton was just stupid.

2032
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:13,800
Alright.

2033
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:16,220
And then another chest.

2034
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:18,580
And then...

2035
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:19,460
Oh, no!

2036
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:20,920
Alright.

2037
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:23,260
Damn, how strong am I?

2038
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,780
What am I?

2039
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:26,960
This is not... woah!

2040
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:31,500
Yum.

2041
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,040
Alright, what else?

2042
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:35,560
What else can I use?

2043
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,840
Can I use, like, skeleton heads?

2044
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,780
What else can I pick up?

2045
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:46,440
Oh my god.

2046
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:47,360
Can I pick you up?

2047
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,200
No, what?

2048
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:51,940
I feel like...

2049
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:54,300
Maybe if I, like, poop on it?

2050
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,520
If I poop enough, do you think I can open it?

2051
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:01,620
No, okay.

2052
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,220
My poop doesn't add weight to it.

2053
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,060
My poop...

2054
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:07,830
Bananas!

2055
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:11,190
Guys, I can't pick up bananas, guys.

2056
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:12,690
It won't let me.

2057
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:14,510
I can only eat.

2058
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:17,370
I can only consume.

2059
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:22,150
Guys, let me out!

2060
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,330
Guys, let me out!

2061
01:24:23,790 --> 01:24:24,850
I don't understand.

2062
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:27,030
What can I pick up?

2063
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:29,130
The pots?

2064
01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:30,930
Oh, I can pick up pots!

2065
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:32,170
Okay, I figured it out.

2066
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:34,050
Alright.

2067
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:35,910
No!

2068
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:37,790
Stay on it!

2069
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:41,670
Stay on the thing!

2070
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:42,010
No!

2071
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:42,710
Okay, nice.

2072
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:43,710
And then...

2073
01:24:43,710 --> 01:24:44,190
Yay!

2074
01:24:45,110 --> 01:24:46,230
Can I open it?

2075
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:48,830
What?

2076
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:50,690
No, stay on top!

2077
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:53,770
Is it the poop?

2078
01:24:55,530 --> 01:24:56,370
There we go.

2079
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:58,470
And then...

2080
01:24:58,470 --> 01:24:59,430
Yay!

2081
01:25:01,850 --> 01:25:02,450
Tornado!

2082
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:05,070
What does tornado do?

2083
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:07,030
Does it throw me out?

2084
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:13,930
I did it!

2085
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:15,750
Unlock the pyramids!

2086
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:19,110
I still need like...

2087
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:20,670
The diamonds.

2088
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:22,110
But I don't know where the diamonds are.

2089
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:25,630
I'm like missing like two more diamonds.

2090
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:29,050
Why are they so scared of me?

2091
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,050
What did I do?

2092
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:34,530
There's no way they know I caused the plague.

2093
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:38,910
Do you think they know I caused the plague?

2094
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:39,630
Do you think they know I caused the plague?

2095
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:41,010
No.

2096
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:42,370
That's impossible.

2097
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:45,070
Those humans aren't smart enough to know.

2098
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:49,490
Alright.

2099
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:50,390
Yay!

2100
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:54,230
Where the fuck is the pharaoh?

2101
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,330
Okay, we need...

2102
01:25:56,330 --> 01:25:56,470
Ow!

2103
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:00,130
Okay, we need like two more diamonds.

2104
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:03,270
Where could the last two diamonds be?

2105
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:05,630
They hide them so well.

2106
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:06,490
I don't understand.

2107
01:26:06,670 --> 01:26:08,570
It's like they don't want me to steal it.

2108
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:10,010
But why wouldn't they?

2109
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:10,710
I'm a crow.

2110
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:13,730
That's what crows do.

2111
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:18,490
You leave the diamonds out...

2112
01:26:18,490 --> 01:26:20,570
so then the crows can steal the diamonds.

2113
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:25,910
Alright, one more.

2114
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:27,450
One more.

2115
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:28,350
Just crow things.

2116
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:29,090
Yeah.

2117
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:30,870
Oh, there it is.

2118
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:33,870
Oh, I think the owner found the big cat.

2119
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:35,490
No!

2120
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:37,410
I want the shiny thing!

2121
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:39,550
Okay, nice.

2122
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:40,590
Yeah!

2123
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:43,970
Oh, wrong way.

2124
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:46,590
I flew past it.

2125
01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:50,490
The shiny thing...

2126
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:53,090
obscured my vision.

2127
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:54,270
Yay!

2128
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:58,610
Okay, I'll knock over the pharaoh's headdress for real quick.

2129
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:00,550
And then he lives here.

2130
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:02,930
Hello, pharaoh.

2131
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:04,630
That's right.

2132
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:05,370
You think...

2133
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:07,050
Wait, where is he?

2134
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:07,790
Oh, there you are.

2135
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:08,970
Boop.

2136
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:11,710
Oh, you think those guards can stop me?

2137
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:13,010
That's fucking right.

2138
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,770
You can't stop me.

2139
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:18,530
You can't stop me!

2140
01:27:19,210 --> 01:27:20,190
Wait, give me a sec.

2141
01:27:20,270 --> 01:27:20,590
I missed.

2142
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:21,810
Oh, please!

2143
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:25,030
It's shiny!

2144
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:30,010
Please stop stopping me!

2145
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:32,030
Yeah, you can't stop.

2146
01:27:32,190 --> 01:27:32,430
No!

2147
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:35,090
It's so...

2148
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:37,830
They're playing Crow Baseball!

2149
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:41,890
Don't make me use this!

2150
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:43,990
There's so many guards!

2151
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:46,610
It's okay, I'm reloading.

2152
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:48,210
Reloading!

2153
01:27:49,310 --> 01:27:49,930
Reloading!

2154
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:50,830
Oh, shit!

2155
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:52,610
Okay, it got reloaded.

2156
01:27:55,490 --> 01:27:56,670
Eventually, it'll hit.

2157
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:57,510
Yeah, that's right.

2158
01:27:57,570 --> 01:27:58,010
Slip.

2159
01:27:58,090 --> 01:27:59,010
Slip and slap.

2160
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:00,490
No, come on!

2161
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:02,130
No!

2162
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,870
I will brute force this!

2163
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:04,290
No!

2164
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:08,770
I guess I'll grab the yellow fruit.

2165
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:09,830
Fine.

2166
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:12,310
I'll grab the yellow fruit.

2167
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:16,410
I just feel a little embarrassed eating one of those, you know?

2168
01:28:16,510 --> 01:28:18,510
Everybody starts staring at me.

2169
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:24,790
Everybody just stares at me.

2170
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:26,370
I feel so embarrassed.

2171
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:30,110
No!

2172
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:35,340
Let me at it!

2173
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:37,460
That's right, I'll surround it.

2174
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:38,720
Alright, nice.

2175
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:40,440
We did it.

2176
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:43,440
I was so stealthy.

2177
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:46,720
I did it.

2178
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:50,160
The stealthiest crow out there.

2179
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:52,740
Here's your fucking headdress.

2180
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:55,560
Yes!

2181
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:57,180
Yes!

2182
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,980
Look who's wearing the big guy hat now!

2183
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,080
Meow!

2184
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:03,500
Someone!

2185
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:04,140
Now!

2186
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:04,660
Bird!

2187
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:06,000
Carry me to the palace!

2188
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:06,920
Oh, shit!

2189
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:08,680
Okay, now he's the king, I guess.

2190
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:10,200
Alright, get over here.

2191
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:12,400
It'll be a shame if I just go.

2192
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:13,220
You!

2193
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:18,500
What are you made of?

2194
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,220
Alright, here I go.

2195
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:22,160
Wew!

2196
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:24,180
Wew!

2197
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:26,120
Feral delivery!

2198
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:28,100
Meow!

2199
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:30,300
Oh my god!

2200
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:35,460
I think I did a good thing today.

2201
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:40,440
And now, Egypt is owned by cats.

2202
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,740
As God intended.

2203
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:47,000
Alright, time to land.

2204
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,060
I did it!

2205
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:49,360
Yay!

2206
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:53,720
The perfect palace.

2207
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:54,720
Wait, what's that?

2208
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:56,620
Wait, is that skin?

2209
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:58,040
Wait!

2210
01:29:58,380 --> 01:29:58,640
No!

2211
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:01,260
Now I actually do have to do the races!

2212
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,500
It's a new skin!

2213
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,320
I want to know what the new skins are!

2214
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:05,860
God damn it.

2215
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:07,920
I have to do the hardest race of my life.

2216
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:12,100
Oh, man.

2217
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:16,300
I have to do the hardest race I've ever done in my life.

2218
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:20,180
The races that are at ultra hard difficulty.

2219
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:23,040
Alright, nice.

2220
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:26,220
I think dad found out about the cats.

2221
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,460
I think dad was not happy about the cat situation.

2222
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:31,240
What the, like...

2223
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,280
What the fuck are these races?

2224
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:34,560
Like, what?

2225
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:36,540
Oh my god, please.

2226
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:37,380
Please.

2227
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:39,100
Crow FPS gamer here.

2228
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:41,340
Alright, nice.

2229
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:42,780
Oh, I don't like that.

2230
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,780
This is... oh my god.

2231
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:46,960
Why did they have to make the races...

2232
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:47,760
Why?!

2233
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:49,600
No!

2234
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,540
No, I ran out of fucking ammo!

2235
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:53,660
Reloading.

2236
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,100
I need to reload!

2237
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:58,520
Okay, there we go.

2238
01:30:58,720 --> 01:30:58,960
Okay, there we go.

2239
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:00,660
This thing sucks.

2240
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,360
Race abandoned?!

2241
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:04,700
How?!

2242
01:31:05,390 --> 01:31:07,320
How did I miss?!

2243
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:09,880
Alright.

2244
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:11,220
Don't worry.

2245
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:11,800
I got this.

2246
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:13,880
I missed one?!

2247
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:16,900
I just want to know what that was!

2248
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:18,620
Okay, here we go.

2249
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:21,960
No, no, no, no.

2250
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:22,680
No!

2251
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:24,660
Reloading!

2252
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:26,400
Okay, nice.

2253
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:28,340
Boop.

2254
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:29,460
Alright.

2255
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,320
And then...

2256
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:31,940
Boop.

2257
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:37,400
I won't make it to the top!

2258
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:41,480
Oh my god, how did this game get harder?

2259
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:44,480
No, I ran out!

2260
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,700
I ran out of ammo!

2261
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:50,060
Oh my god, okay.

2262
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:55,720
Thank god, this is so dumb.

2263
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:58,320
Oh my god, I'm running out of ammo too.

2264
01:31:58,600 --> 01:31:59,100
No!

2265
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:01,700
Get out of these broads!

2266
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:02,120
No!

2267
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:03,520
Please!

2268
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,660
Leave me alone!

2269
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:09,440
No!

2270
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:11,280
Oh, I just made it.

2271
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:14,200
I literally just made it.

2272
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:19,380
I literally just made it to the end.

2273
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:22,240
I already got the...

2274
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:25,020
I already hit it.

2275
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:27,420
I already did this quest.

2276
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:28,920
You're fucking too slow.

2277
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:29,980
No, you're too slow.

2278
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:31,240
Alright.

2279
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:34,340
This is the last time I'm ever doing the race.

2280
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,160
I just need 150.

2281
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:41,080
Please tell me I don't have to poop again, please.

2282
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:42,180
No!

2283
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:45,340
Nice.

2284
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:46,300
Okay.

2285
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,140
Okay, we can do this.

2286
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:50,880
Croaky, you can do this, Croaky.

2287
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:53,700
Remember what your grandmama taught you, Croaky.

2288
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:55,660
Come on.

2289
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:56,560
Not like that.

2290
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,980
Not like that, Croaky.

2291
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:03,280
Remember the other lessons that your grandmama taught you.

2292
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,220
Oh my god, please.

2293
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:06,360
Please.

2294
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:10,660
I got it.

2295
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:12,580
I did it.

2296
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:14,060
Oh my god, five more.

2297
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,500
Two more races to go.

2298
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:17,500
Dad, please!

2299
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:19,280
I know this is embarrassing!

2300
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:21,780
What the fuck?

2301
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:23,400
What is this?

2302
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:26,380
What the fuck is this?

2303
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,160
This is not a race!

2304
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:30,700
Okay.

2305
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:32,180
We can do it.

2306
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,040
This is fine.

2307
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:35,140
We're just walking.

2308
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:37,340
Can't be that bad.

2309
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:38,680
We're just walking.

2310
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,580
What kind of race is this?

2311
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:45,200
Easy.

2312
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:45,980
Okay.

2313
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:46,800
One more.

2314
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:48,480
One more to go.

2315
01:33:53,180 --> 01:33:54,360
Please, no more.

2316
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:55,780
Please, just race.

2317
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,280
No, no.

2318
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,140
I hope to...

2319
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,480
Oh, the tornadoes are gone.

2320
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:01,920
Thank god.

2321
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:03,720
Okay, never mind.

2322
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:05,940
Alright.

2323
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,680
The last race.

2324
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:11,700
Okay, this is actually a lot...

2325
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:14,480
Okay, never mind.

2326
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:15,020
Maybe not.

2327
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:15,820
Maybe not.

2328
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:22,860
I just realized the tornadoes are very dangerous.

2329
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,780
It might not be as easier as I thought.

2330
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:26,960
Oh.

2331
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:29,800
Oh, no!

2332
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:30,420
No!

2333
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,000
Oh, I hit the thing.

2334
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:33,800
No!

2335
01:34:38,010 --> 01:34:38,810
No!

2336
01:34:38,850 --> 01:34:39,330
No!

2337
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:42,330
I just went a lot.

2338
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:48,190
Stupid tornadoes.

2339
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,790
Wait.

2340
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:51,250
No!

2341
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:56,430
It's not fair!

2342
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:00,930
This race isn't fair!

2343
01:35:03,450 --> 01:35:06,450
This flight is set to you'll be safe.

2344
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:08,930
This is it.

2345
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:11,590
Croaky was never meant to fly.

2346
01:35:15,570 --> 01:35:15,910
No!

2347
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:21,510
The moment I flew, I knew it.

2348
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:24,550
I knew Croaky was never meant to fly.

2349
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:26,270
Okay, okay, this time.

2350
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:28,690
This time it'll work, guys.

2351
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:30,290
Alright.

2352
01:35:31,390 --> 01:35:32,250
Croaky's got this.

2353
01:35:32,890 --> 01:35:33,630
Fuck off!

2354
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:37,560
Okay, there we go.

2355
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:39,860
If I don't fly, they can't hurt me.

2356
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,480
If I don't fly, they can't hurt me.

2357
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:44,720
If I don't...

2358
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,120
I'm just scouting ahead.

2359
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:47,660
I'm just scouting ahead.

2360
01:35:48,460 --> 01:35:48,920
Ahhh!

2361
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:58,380
Wait, can I just do it at night?

2362
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:59,200
Oh my god, wait.

2363
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:01,780
In night time, there's no tornadoes.

2364
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:02,460
Okay, you're right.

2365
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:03,540
No!

2366
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:08,460
I'll eventually be able to get there.

2367
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:10,280
Oh my god.

2368
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:10,900
You're right.

2369
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:12,180
You're right.

2370
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:14,840
Tornadoes are...

2371
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,320
Tornadoes need to sleep.

2372
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,580
So at night time, they don't show up.

2373
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:21,660
That's the tornado lore.

2374
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:26,240
Did you guys know that even tornadoes need their nap time?

2375
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:28,680
Alright.

2376
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:29,320
There we go.

2377
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:31,020
We should be fine.

2378
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:33,680
Tornado lore.

2379
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:38,360
Yeah.

2380
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:41,200
They're off the clock at like 8pm.

2381
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:46,440
Their shift starts at like 8am to 8pm every day.

2382
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:49,780
So you just gotta find the right tornado hours.

2383
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,300
So like, if the...

2384
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,980
So like, tornadoes don't exist after 8pm.

2385
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,860
They're like salarymen.

2386
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:01,600
They're like salarymen.

2387
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:02,420
Oh my god.

2388
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:03,200
Woo!

2389
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,040
I did it, guys.

2390
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:06,520
I figured it out.

2391
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:10,200
Alright.

2392
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:10,620
Nice.

2393
01:37:11,140 --> 01:37:11,760
Yay!

2394
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:15,780
Yeah!

2395
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:17,760
We did it.

2396
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:18,880
We completed everything.

2397
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:22,220
Wow, even tornadoes have union...

2398
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:23,260
have unions.

2399
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:25,780
Alright, what did I unlock?

2400
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:27,880
Where's my nest?

2401
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:30,140
Boop.

2402
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:31,780
So what did I unlock?

2403
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:35,020
Oh my god!

2404
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:35,660
I can be a chicken!

2405
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:42,110
I can be a chicken!

2406
01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:43,950
Alright.

2407
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:46,770
I wanna see what it looks like.

2408
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:50,610
What does a chicken look like?

2409
01:37:50,810 --> 01:37:53,050
How many skins are there?

2410
01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:55,770
Oh, I don't like chicken croquis.

2411
01:37:58,730 --> 01:38:00,490
No, we gotta get back to croquis.

2412
01:38:01,230 --> 01:38:03,130
Guys, the skins lie.

2413
01:38:03,850 --> 01:38:04,450
Alright.

2414
01:38:05,450 --> 01:38:06,870
No, no return to chicken.

2415
01:38:07,210 --> 01:38:08,250
Oh, we're gonna be camping?

2416
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:11,070
How many levels are there?

2417
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:25,970
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, Wow, guys!

2418
01:38:25,970 --> 01:38:27,070
There's only one level left.

2419
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:31,700
Wow!

2420
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:33,740
Can't believe it!

2421
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:35,660
This is such a fast game!

2422
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:38,380
This is the last level, everybody!

2423
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:39,700
Wow!

2424
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:41,840
Alright.

2425
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:43,020
What the fuck?

2426
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:45,300
Freeze?

2427
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,320
Hello, crow.

2428
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:51,060
We had a busy hiking season.

2429
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,860
Lots of campers.

2430
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,220
Lots of campers.

2431
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:55,900
Not all of them very thoughtful, you know.

2432
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:59,380
Some left their fires still burning around the forest.

2433
01:39:00,020 --> 01:39:00,800
So irresponsible.

2434
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:04,540
Say, would you be a grand bird and help us put them up?

2435
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:09,480
Just splash them with some water or some other bodily fluids if you can catch my drift.

2436
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:10,520
Thanks, crow.

2437
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:12,960
Remember, only you can prevent forest fires.

2438
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:14,400
How did it get so big?

2439
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:18,440
Wait, did I do it?

2440
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:21,380
I guess I did because it stopped making noises.

2441
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,480
How did...

2442
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:25,720
Are they people?

2443
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:27,080
Animals?

2444
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:28,900
Or furries?

2445
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:30,280
I can't tell!

2446
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:33,080
What kind of abominations are they?

2447
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:38,540
If I put fire on it and then put it out with my...

2448
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:38,920
Oh no.

2449
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,680
Not the fast poop.

2450
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:43,200
Are they animals?

2451
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:45,940
Hello there, little crow.

2452
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:47,420
Look at that mess.

2453
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:48,780
Our camp is in shambles.

2454
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:51,760
Bunch of mean crows showed up and stole stuff.

2455
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:52,860
Can you believe it?

2456
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:56,940
I heard they've been stealing things to build their own secluded city.

2457
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:57,580
Could it be?

2458
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:03,540
Anyway, maybe you can help us restore our camp.

2459
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:08,700
I saw them drop a few fuel cans at the abandoned gas station just south of here.

2460
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:12,140
But be careful, I heard wicked noises from that direction.

2461
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:17,200
Okay, I need to get like fuel for the camp.

2462
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:19,420
Ooh, spooky.

2463
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:21,360
First self.

2464
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:23,540
Surf is up.

2465
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,060
Is self down?

2466
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:26,360
Self is down, right?

2467
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:28,960
Oh, there's like dinosaur bones.

2468
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,300
Hey, crow!

2469
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:33,440
You know what's really trending right now?

2470
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:34,880
What?

2471
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:35,460
Wrong!

2472
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:36,460
Dinosaurs!

2473
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:39,920
Please, crow.

2474
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,560
Please put this dinosaur skeleton together.

2475
01:40:42,740 --> 01:40:47,920
My fans, my audience on flip-flap, they crave dinosaurs.

2476
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:50,940
Do it for the flap!

2477
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:51,640
Please!

2478
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:53,160
Okay.

2479
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:54,280
What do I do?

2480
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,040
Do I just give you the bone?

2481
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:57,760
Oh!

2482
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:58,160
Oh!

2483
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:02,180
Oh, I have to assemble it for you!

2484
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:04,400
Oh my gosh, she is an influencer.

2485
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:06,480
I bet she wants it for free too.

2486
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,140
Fucking influencers?

2487
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:09,040
Couldn't be me.

2488
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,380
I'm just a regular crow.

2489
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:12,000
Wouldn't be influencing anything.

2490
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,320
Got your leg.

2491
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:19,220
Bird leg.

2492
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:19,920
Oh!

2493
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:21,940
I don't put this.

2494
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:23,740
Oh, that's how I put it.

2495
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:25,740
No for exposure.

2496
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:28,720
Yeah, she seems like an exposure bird.

2497
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:31,080
And not the good kind of exposure.

2498
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,980
I'm gonna get paid for exposure, man.

2499
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:36,480
Oh!

2500
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:39,140
Did I?

2501
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:39,860
No!

2502
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:42,900
I didn't put a fire out!

2503
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,220
Okay, I needed the normal poops.

2504
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:48,160
Not the fast one.

2505
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:50,880
We are not going fast today.

2506
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:52,660
Where's the skull?

2507
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:54,440
I'm just missing the skull.

2508
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,180
Where the fuck did they put it?

2509
01:41:58,140 --> 01:41:58,780
Hello?

2510
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:00,920
Wait, is this danger?

2511
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:03,020
Oh, this is danger cloud.

2512
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:04,740
Oh, there it is.

2513
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:07,760
Hello!

2514
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:08,740
Here's the skull.

2515
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:10,040
Ah!

2516
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:12,320
Yay!

2517
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:14,800
Oh my god!

2518
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:17,320
The dinosaur slaps!

2519
01:42:18,020 --> 01:42:19,200
I pushed it off.

2520
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:20,180
It's all over the bird net.

2521
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:23,140
We're gonna be so viral.

2522
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:25,540
Thank you again, crow!

2523
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:26,760
Yeah?

2524
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:28,120
Do I get paid?

2525
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:30,360
Oh, I got 15 exposure bucks.

2526
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:31,300
Thank you so much.

2527
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:32,620
I can feed my family now.

2528
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:36,880
Oh my god.

2529
01:42:36,940 --> 01:42:39,260
Guys, I got my 15 exposure bucks.

2530
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,720
Guys, it's over.

2531
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:43,320
It's so over for all of you.

2532
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:47,760
Oh, hey.

2533
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:48,600
Who's...

2534
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:50,300
Did they lose the children again?

2535
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:51,900
Oh my god.

2536
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:53,560
She lost her kids again?

2537
01:42:55,180 --> 01:42:57,560
Alright, let's find the mom.

2538
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:01,760
Where the fuck is the mom?

2539
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:03,260
Hello?

2540
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:06,640
Croaky, croaky, help!

2541
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,520
My brother has gone missing!

2542
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:12,100
He went on about some spooky shadows.

2543
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:14,600
And went deep into the forest.

2544
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:16,900
Cucumber and Gary, thank you for the super chat.

2545
01:43:16,980 --> 01:43:17,180
Thank you.

2546
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:20,620
Please follow his tracks and find him.

2547
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,800
Oh, and be careful.

2548
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:24,820
Maybe there's something that can help.

2549
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:26,480
Alright.

2550
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,360
Where the fuck is the mom?

2551
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:30,460
I gotta stop that forest fire.

2552
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:33,380
Can't have any fires coming out.

2553
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:38,640
I don't know where the mom's at.

2554
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:39,620
Oh, hey.

2555
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:41,320
Alright, I'm gonna put you here.

2556
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:44,680
This creature, they come from the dark.

2557
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,100
But they fear the light.

2558
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:47,520
I must press onwards.

2559
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:50,940
If I don't catch them long enough, they will surely disappear.

2560
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:52,280
Alright.

2561
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:53,640
How bad can they be?

2562
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:54,980
I'm a fucking crow.

2563
01:43:57,420 --> 01:43:58,380
Is it these guys?

2564
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:00,880
What are they gonna do, slap me?

2565
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:04,120
Oh.

2566
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:08,860
Okay, they make it sound like he's gonna fucking kill me.

2567
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:13,680
The lamps, of course, I can lure them in and they will be toast.

2568
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:15,440
But like, they are just existing.

2569
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:18,380
They're not even doing anything dangerous.

2570
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:20,760
It's not just figures.

2571
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,560
The objects, too.

2572
01:44:22,860 --> 01:44:24,900
They're possessed by the same darkness.

2573
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:27,660
Are the shadows coming from my nightmares?

2574
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,460
Or are the... wait, is this...

2575
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:30,620
Is this Alan Wake?

2576
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,200
Yeah, I was gonna say!

2577
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:35,000
Wait a minute, is this Alan Wake?

2578
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:38,380
It's Crow Key Wake.

2579
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:38,980
Yeah, that's right.

2580
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:39,620
Get over here.

2581
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:41,820
Oh, okay.

2582
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:42,860
He did get over here.

2583
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:44,960
What do I do?

2584
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:46,760
Whoa!

2585
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:48,700
Oh my god, it is Alan Wake!

2586
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:53,980
Alright, guys.

2587
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:55,800
It's Crow Key Wake.

2588
01:44:57,660 --> 01:44:58,060
Oh!

2589
01:44:58,860 --> 01:45:00,040
I need to get the generator!

2590
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:02,440
Cure them!

2591
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:03,880
They're trying to lock him in!

2592
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:05,800
But there has to be a way to open the gate!

2593
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:06,920
I must be smart!

2594
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:10,720
I don't need no flashlight!

2595
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,180
Okay, we need to get the...

2596
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:15,320
How the fuck do I press this button?

2597
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:17,280
Oh!

2598
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:18,220
Okay, that's how.

2599
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:19,680
Okay, yellow!

2600
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,240
And then green!

2601
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,020
What is it gonna do?

2602
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:25,940
Fucking kill me?

2603
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:27,920
It's a fucking garbage bag.

2604
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:29,440
There you go.

2605
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:30,540
Yay!

2606
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,440
Nobody is smarter than a crow.

2607
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:38,340
How long has it been since I've seen sunlight?

2608
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:39,900
Days?

2609
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:40,980
Years?

2610
01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:43,580
The time passes strangely here.

2611
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:45,520
Oh, I see a house!

2612
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:46,900
A place of refuge!

2613
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:48,460
Over there!

2614
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:50,460
Oh shit, forest fire!

2615
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:52,740
Help!

2616
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:54,160
Oh, is that the brother?

2617
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:55,320
Oh, a crow!

2618
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,500
My brother must have sent you!

2619
01:45:57,960 --> 01:45:58,820
Oh my god!

2620
01:45:59,200 --> 01:45:59,940
Hedge wake!

2621
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:02,140
Please, I'm stranded, surrounded!

2622
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:03,640
I cannot make my escape!

2623
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:06,800
Defeat the shadow creatures below by all means possible!

2624
01:46:07,420 --> 01:46:09,120
Don't worry, I know what to do!

2625
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:11,680
Don't worry!

2626
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:12,780
Hedge wake!

2627
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,420
I know what to do!

2628
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:15,040
Ow!

2629
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:20,960
I'll just stand right here!

2630
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,400
I did it!

2631
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:27,180
By doing nothing at all!

2632
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:28,920
My goodness!

2633
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:30,380
You did it!

2634
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,600
You saved us, Croaky!

2635
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:34,380
You magnificent bird!

2636
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:35,640
Phew!

2637
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:37,800
You should be safe from now on.

2638
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:41,500
Looks like some of the magical fog lifted too.

2639
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:44,200
You should be able to get around more easily.

2640
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:45,320
Gosh!

2641
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:48,680
I will spread the stories of your brave battles far and wide!

2642
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,380
Mock my words!

2643
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:52,080
Mock my words!

2644
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:53,180
It's that easy!

2645
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:56,760
The fog gun?

2646
01:46:57,460 --> 01:46:59,380
Oh, I can go through it now!

2647
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:01,500
Oh, hey!

2648
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:02,160
There's more flashlight!

2649
01:47:05,060 --> 01:47:05,660
Yeehaw!

2650
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:07,000
Howdy, crow!

2651
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,180
Ah, I'm Steven!

2652
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:10,180
Hey, Steven!

2653
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:15,140
The ultimate shadow of the seven deaths of nightmares and misery!

2654
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:16,820
And your name is Steven?

2655
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:20,660
Damn!

2656
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:22,520
To be fair, Steven's...

2657
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:24,940
All Stevens are bad!

2658
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,540
Never trust a Steven!

2659
01:47:32,380 --> 01:47:40,680
You know, when possessing innocent campers, I thought to myself, there has to be more to life than this.

2660
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:43,900
So I decided to pack my bags and go traveling.

2661
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:47,300
I've climbed the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

2662
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,920
I ate a pickle heron in Helsinki.

2663
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:54,160
I drove cross-country visiting all the United States.

2664
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:57,400
I'm not the young shadow I used to be no more.

2665
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:00,120
So I came back home to settle down.

2666
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:02,740
Be with my family and friends.

2667
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:03,880
You know how I do.

2668
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:07,580
Built me this here little house for myself.

2669
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:10,880
But alas, it got covered by other shadows.

2670
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:16,540
Would you be a dear and use this flashy light of yours to clean up all the other darkness?

2671
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:18,260
So you want me to commit murder?

2672
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:22,360
Just don't point it at me because, you know, what happens?

2673
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,680
Anyway, I appreciate your help in this matter.

2674
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:26,080
Damn!

2675
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:27,740
He hates his own kind.

2676
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:30,100
Wait.

2677
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:31,080
You don't die.

2678
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:32,480
Whoops.

2679
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:33,000
Oops.

2680
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:34,640
You're fine.

2681
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:37,720
I can't believe it!

2682
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:40,300
He hates his own shadow kind!

2683
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:44,120
He wants to be the last remaining shadow!

2684
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,020
It just hurts a little bit.

2685
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:51,740
Well, darn.

2686
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:53,880
You've done me a great solid, Crow!

2687
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:59,640
What if that was his family and he was like, I can't have my mother-in-law live with me again.

2688
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:01,900
Oh, man.

2689
01:49:02,380 --> 01:49:04,800
My mother-in-law, she like disappeared.

2690
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:07,460
Same with like my father-in-law.

2691
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:08,480
What a shame.

2692
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:10,080
Sorry, sweetie.

2693
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:11,660
Don't know what happened to them.

2694
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:12,700
I guess they just left.

2695
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:16,200
They did visit us, but they just left today.

2696
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:17,060
You just missed them.

2697
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:24,860
I'll be sure to let everyone know what's the great partner you are.

2698
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:27,060
Don't be a stranger.

2699
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:29,780
Stop by anytime you're in the mood for a cuppa.

2700
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:30,940
Nice.

2701
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:34,320
Oh, what's this?

2702
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:35,520
Hey, what's this?

2703
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:37,960
Oh, I got a scary mask.

2704
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:39,220
Pop, pop, pop.

2705
01:49:39,220 --> 01:49:41,000
Tss, tss, tss, tss.

2706
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,780
Alright, let's see.

2707
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,560
We got a...

2708
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:48,300
Oh, ow.

2709
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:49,460
Oh, no.

2710
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:51,140
The trees.

2711
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:55,520
The trees are playing ping-pong, playing ping-pong with me.

2712
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:57,880
Oh, I have to follow the path.

2713
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,580
I can't just go wherever I want.

2714
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:02,140
Okay, this way.

2715
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:05,340
What happened to like the mama hamster?

2716
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,400
I'd assume like...

2717
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:09,200
Wait, what does the fuel can look like?

2718
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:12,200
Is this a fuel can?

2719
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:15,700
Is this a fuel can?

2720
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:16,880
Is this a fuel can?

2721
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:17,740
Oh, self is down.

2722
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:19,100
Self is down.

2723
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:20,500
I figured it out.

2724
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:22,020
Oh, there's the mom.

2725
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:24,320
I just missed the mom.

2726
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:28,000
My babies.

2727
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:29,660
My babies.

2728
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:32,440
They have once again disappeared.

2729
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:36,480
Scattered, dispersed, non-existent.

2730
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:39,060
Well, they probably hid somewhere around the dark.

2731
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:41,340
Will you bring them back to me, crow?

2732
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:43,140
My fur babies.

2733
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:44,480
Please?

2734
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:48,060
How many babies does she have?

2735
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:49,460
Okay, still three.

2736
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:50,800
Okay, she didn't make more.

2737
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:51,760
Thank God.

2738
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:53,840
I was worried she made more.

2739
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:56,460
Alright, here we are.

2740
01:50:57,300 --> 01:50:57,960
Oh, hey.

2741
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:01,420
Those are some gnarly beasts down there.

2742
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:03,460
But I noticed they quite like our poop.

2743
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:05,620
Maybe you can use that to our advantage.

2744
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:06,300
What?

2745
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:06,560
What?

2746
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:08,780
Are these zombies?

2747
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:12,560
Are they gonna...

2748
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:16,260
Oh my God, they're fucking freaks.

2749
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:17,940
Oh my God.

2750
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:18,840
They're zombies?

2751
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:22,840
Did I do this?

2752
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:23,420
No.

2753
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:24,720
No, it can't be me.

2754
01:51:26,060 --> 01:51:28,440
Did I poop too much?

2755
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:33,620
How do I put the fuel can?

2756
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:34,760
Oh, here.

2757
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:36,340
No.

2758
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:38,140
It's never my fault.

2759
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:44,940
The birdemic is real.

2760
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:49,500
The radioactive poop.

2761
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:51,680
No!

2762
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:54,840
I am your creator!

2763
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,720
You're not allowed to slap me!

2764
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:58,480
What was this?

2765
01:51:58,560 --> 01:51:59,460
Oh, okay.

2766
01:51:59,520 --> 01:51:59,760
Poop.

2767
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,120
Okay, nice.

2768
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:02,940
I got out of that.

2769
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:07,020
Alright, I gotta bring my fuel can over.

2770
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:11,660
Alright, here you go.

2771
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:15,600
Alright, we need one more.

2772
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:17,720
We just need one more.

2773
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:18,360
Woo!

2774
01:52:20,020 --> 01:52:20,540
Woo!

2775
01:52:24,370 --> 01:52:25,350
Last one.

2776
01:52:27,490 --> 01:52:28,530
Alright, here we go.

2777
01:52:29,810 --> 01:52:30,150
Let's go.

2778
01:52:32,490 --> 01:52:34,370
And then we gotta find the babies.

2779
01:52:34,510 --> 01:52:35,490
I don't know where I...

2780
01:52:36,050 --> 01:52:38,730
Oh my god, I don't know where I left the babies on some of the areas.

2781
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:40,990
Now we got us all the fuel we need.

2782
01:52:41,210 --> 01:52:44,450
I hooked up a few lanterns of generator while you were gone.

2783
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:48,390
We just need to put them up on the four pillars around the camp.

2784
01:52:48,650 --> 01:52:50,170
Can you do that, little crow?

2785
01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:51,610
Wait, I have to do more?

2786
01:52:53,210 --> 01:52:55,610
I have to do more work for you?

2787
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:57,770
What does that even mean?

2788
01:52:59,710 --> 01:53:00,890
Is that a pole?

2789
01:53:01,270 --> 01:53:02,170
Oh, that's a pole.

2790
01:53:02,330 --> 01:53:02,890
Okay, guys.

2791
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:03,970
I learned what shapes are.

2792
01:53:05,710 --> 01:53:07,130
CrowKey has done it.

2793
01:53:08,290 --> 01:53:09,550
I have evolved.

2794
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:12,730
I learned what pole shapes are like.

2795
01:53:15,850 --> 01:53:18,190
Can anybody stop this crow?

2796
01:53:19,490 --> 01:53:19,790
Yay!

2797
01:53:21,590 --> 01:53:23,050
I have to do more?

2798
01:53:23,890 --> 01:53:28,450
By golly, what an amazing little helper you are, CrowKey friend.

2799
01:53:29,630 --> 01:53:31,230
The camp is almost ready.

2800
01:53:31,270 --> 01:53:33,130
Just watch as I power on the generator.

2801
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:34,950
Oh, I can just watch.

2802
01:53:35,090 --> 01:53:35,370
Nice!

2803
01:53:35,650 --> 01:53:36,750
I did it!

2804
01:53:37,870 --> 01:53:38,430
Yay!

2805
01:53:38,430 --> 01:53:38,990
Alright.

2806
01:53:39,910 --> 01:53:41,490
I completed the level.

2807
01:53:41,590 --> 01:53:43,090
I don't think there's anything I missed.

2808
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:45,410
Yep, nothing at all.

2809
01:53:45,930 --> 01:53:47,430
Ha ha ha ha!

2810
01:53:49,010 --> 01:53:51,210
I think, I think I did it, guys!

2811
01:53:51,470 --> 01:53:54,370
I'm pretty sure I did everything I have to do here.

2812
01:53:54,850 --> 01:53:57,170
I didn't miss one single mission.

2813
01:53:57,710 --> 01:53:59,050
Oh, I got a cowboy hat.

2814
01:53:59,210 --> 01:54:00,190
Oh my god, wait!

2815
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:01,110
New hat!

2816
01:54:03,710 --> 01:54:03,990
Children?

2817
01:54:03,990 --> 01:54:04,510
What kids?

2818
01:54:06,190 --> 01:54:08,650
Look, it's called Survival of the fittest.

2819
01:54:08,830 --> 01:54:10,430
If they don't survive, that's on them.

2820
01:54:12,390 --> 01:54:12,990
Alright.

2821
01:54:13,190 --> 01:54:15,710
They're only making it so that...

2822
01:54:16,710 --> 01:54:17,310
Okay.

2823
01:54:17,690 --> 01:54:18,990
Ha ha ha ha!

2824
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:20,690
Is this Pyramid Head?

2825
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:22,550
From the deepest... Oh, it is!

2826
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:26,530
From the deepest depths of the subconscious world!

2827
01:54:27,150 --> 01:54:28,330
Ha ha ha ha!

2828
01:54:29,250 --> 01:54:30,270
Pyramid Crow.

2829
01:54:30,270 --> 01:54:31,670
Wait, where is he?

2830
01:54:32,250 --> 01:54:32,970
Yee-haw!

2831
01:54:33,090 --> 01:54:34,010
I want a yee-haw!

2832
01:54:34,370 --> 01:54:35,210
Halley, partner!

2833
01:54:35,310 --> 01:54:36,770
Be ashamed if you got pooped on!

2834
01:54:37,270 --> 01:54:37,910
Yee-haw!

2835
01:54:39,210 --> 01:54:40,710
It's Bounty Hunter Crow!

2836
01:54:41,470 --> 01:54:42,590
Ha ha ha ha!

2837
01:54:43,350 --> 01:54:44,230
I'm actually curious.

2838
01:54:44,350 --> 01:54:45,090
What is this?

2839
01:54:46,010 --> 01:54:47,950
Acre Allen Crow?!

2840
01:54:47,950 --> 01:54:54,450
Once upon a midnight deer while I pounded weak and weary over many a queen.

2841
01:54:54,710 --> 01:54:56,610
Oh my god, Acre Allen Crow.

2842
01:54:56,690 --> 01:54:57,250
Wait, what's this?

2843
01:54:59,050 --> 01:54:59,570
Riveria.

2844
01:55:00,270 --> 01:55:01,310
Be ashamed if... Okay.

2845
01:55:01,470 --> 01:55:02,030
Oh, it's Paris!

2846
01:55:02,530 --> 01:55:04,010
Ha ha ha ha!

2847
01:55:04,710 --> 01:55:06,250
It's fucking Paris.

2848
01:55:07,490 --> 01:55:07,970
Um...

2849
01:55:07,970 --> 01:55:09,950
I wanted to see what the other areas are.

2850
01:55:10,030 --> 01:55:10,190
Okay.

2851
01:55:10,210 --> 01:55:11,850
I want to see what Acre Allen Crow is like.

2852
01:55:13,290 --> 01:55:14,710
Guys, I found a secret level.

2853
01:55:15,090 --> 01:55:19,670
I know I said last level was like the final level, but like I found a secret level, guys.

2854
01:55:19,730 --> 01:55:20,390
It's like DLC.

2855
01:55:21,330 --> 01:55:22,130
Ah, bones.

2856
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:23,530
Another haunted mansion?

2857
01:55:24,270 --> 01:55:26,530
I have a package for the guy living there.

2858
01:55:26,590 --> 01:55:27,430
Mr. Acre.

2859
01:55:28,290 --> 01:55:30,210
But that mansion is haunted.

2860
01:55:30,270 --> 01:55:31,830
With g-g-g-g-ghosts.

2861
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:33,750
You think I'm stepping a foot in there?

2862
01:55:34,510 --> 01:55:35,430
No, sir.

2863
01:55:36,130 --> 01:55:38,030
I learned my lesson last time.

2864
01:55:38,170 --> 01:55:40,190
No more haunted mansions.

2865
01:55:40,910 --> 01:55:42,550
Do me a favor, will ya?

2866
01:55:43,210 --> 01:55:44,610
Scare that guy away.

2867
01:55:45,430 --> 01:55:47,310
So I can give him his package.

2868
01:55:47,870 --> 01:55:51,610
I really just need him to sign for it and then I'll get on with my route.

2869
01:55:52,950 --> 01:55:54,030
Alright, yee-haw.

2870
01:55:54,110 --> 01:55:54,610
Let's go.

2871
01:55:56,730 --> 01:55:57,690
Where is this?

2872
01:55:59,230 --> 01:56:00,070
Yee-haw.

2873
01:56:00,670 --> 01:56:02,470
I wanna see what Acre Oh my god.

2874
01:56:02,530 --> 01:56:05,470
You lost your babies again?!

2875
01:56:06,050 --> 01:56:08,430
Oh, because I never found him in the first place.

2876
01:56:11,050 --> 01:56:12,090
There's no again.

2877
01:56:12,290 --> 01:56:13,890
I just never found him.

2878
01:56:19,570 --> 01:56:21,510
It's working the night till death.

2879
01:56:22,830 --> 01:56:23,890
Okay, let's see.

2880
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:25,750
I wanna know what the other missions are like.

2881
01:56:26,010 --> 01:56:26,330
Oh, hey.

2882
01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:27,250
Oh, is this Pac-Man?

2883
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:32,020
I'm late for ghost school.

2884
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:35,680
Nobody perform my ritual and I can leave until someone does.

2885
01:56:36,220 --> 01:56:38,820
Grab that salt bag and draw the shape, please.

2886
01:56:38,980 --> 01:56:39,440
Wait, what?

2887
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:42,080
What's the shape supposed to look like?

2888
01:56:45,620 --> 01:56:46,120
Oh!

2889
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:46,500
Oh!

2890
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:47,460
The triangle!

2891
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:50,120
Oh, I see.

2892
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:52,000
Don't worry, I got you.

2893
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:54,360
I got you, baby.

2894
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:55,760
Don't worry.

2895
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:57,140
Am I drawing it?

2896
01:56:57,340 --> 01:56:59,280
This is like that Mario Kart game.

2897
01:56:59,480 --> 01:56:59,820
No, I'm sorry.

2898
01:57:00,020 --> 01:57:01,300
Mario Party game.

2899
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:03,080
Where you have to draw the line.

2900
01:57:03,580 --> 01:57:05,460
Don't worry, I got you, ghost.

2901
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:06,980
Pew!

2902
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:08,040
Pew!

2903
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:09,980
Heart attack.

2904
01:57:10,780 --> 01:57:13,420
Yeah, this is heart attack.

2905
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:15,980
Is this a Triforce?

2906
01:57:16,820 --> 01:57:19,380
Why does this ghost need to draw a Triforce?

2907
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:24,740
Oh, it looks exactly like the shadow marks.

2908
01:57:25,100 --> 01:57:28,060
I can now go to ghost school with all my other ghost friends.

2909
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:31,500
I did it.

2910
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:34,040
Beautiful.

2911
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:38,460
I truly am made for art.

2912
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:42,100
Alright, let's see.

2913
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:43,360
Wait, what's this?

2914
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:51,760
That's...

2915
01:57:53,660 --> 01:57:54,480
Wait a minute.

2916
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:57,700
Wait a minute.

2917
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:00,400
Did she...

2918
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:02,040
Did she eat them?

2919
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:03,020
Wait...

2920
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:09,380
I didn't save them last...

2921
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:11,060
This is what happened?

2922
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:13,120
Wait, what does she say?

2923
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:14,940
What does she say?

2924
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:16,900
My babies!

2925
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:19,820
They went trick-or-treating and dis...

2926
01:58:19,820 --> 01:58:20,680
Oh no!

2927
01:58:22,220 --> 01:58:23,560
Find them for me!

2928
01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:24,480
I baked you!

2929
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:25,840
What did you do?

2930
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,760
Were they the tree?

2931
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:32,940
Ma'am, were they the tree?

2932
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:40,280
I didn't save them for one day!

2933
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,600
And now they're ghosts.

2934
01:58:44,820 --> 01:58:45,860
Oh my God.

2935
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:48,100
Ew, what the fuck happened, Edgar?

2936
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:50,040
What the fuck?

2937
01:58:50,060 --> 01:58:51,600
There's so many rats in here.

2938
01:58:51,820 --> 01:58:54,620
What are you doing, Mr. Edgar Allan Poe?

2939
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:58,040
He's like in his bedroom, right?

2940
01:58:58,960 --> 01:58:59,560
Hello?

2941
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:03,740
Am I scaring you?

2942
01:59:04,620 --> 01:59:05,820
Are you scared?

2943
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:07,880
Why do I scare you?

2944
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:09,760
Oh, I know.

2945
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:14,000
Wait, he's not scared of me!

2946
01:59:15,740 --> 01:59:17,660
He's not scared of me!

2947
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:20,400
Oh my God.

2948
01:59:21,020 --> 01:59:22,240
Wait, maybe this?

2949
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:25,720
How is he not scared?

2950
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:28,320
I'm a bird!

2951
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:30,080
Hahaha!

2952
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:34,760
Do I get the blanket?

2953
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:36,780
Oh!

2954
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:39,520
Can I be a ghost?

2955
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:41,920
No, I can't.

2956
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:42,740
God damn it!

2957
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:45,840
Wait, unless...

2958
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:49,800
No, okay, I thought I could like, knock it over.

2959
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:51,080
Can I?

2960
01:59:51,820 --> 01:59:52,700
No, I can't.

2961
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,580
No, I can't knock it over!

2962
01:59:57,120 --> 01:59:58,920
Wait, why aren't you scared of me?

2963
01:59:58,980 --> 01:59:59,520
I'm a crow!

2964
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:04,080
Okay, what if I like, do like this?

2965
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:06,540
Vroom!

2966
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:08,760
No, he's not scared of me.

2967
02:00:09,180 --> 02:00:11,620
A human that's not scared of Croaky?

2968
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:13,020
We gotta eliminate him.

2969
02:00:13,860 --> 02:00:14,300
Hahaha!

2970
02:00:17,180 --> 02:00:18,560
We gotta get rid of him.

2971
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:19,240
Hahaha!

2972
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:22,060
We can't let this go to public.

2973
02:00:22,700 --> 02:00:23,140
Hahaha!

2974
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:23,300
Hahaha!

2975
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:26,940
Oh!

2976
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:29,140
Do you hear the whispers?

2977
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:34,000
Do you hear ba-da-da-dum-ba-dum- dum-dum-dum.

2978
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:35,360
What the fuck?

2979
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:36,640
Wait, there's a spider here.

2980
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:41,480
He's too dangerous to be left alive.

2981
02:00:43,460 --> 02:00:46,540
Wait, can I make this gaggle?

2982
02:00:48,240 --> 02:00:48,880
Oh!

2983
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:50,080
Okay.

2984
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:53,040
This isn't a defense.

2985
02:00:53,140 --> 02:00:54,620
Enter level threat.

2986
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:57,800
How the fuck do I scare you?

2987
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:03,440
What can scare you in your bedroom?

2988
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:07,700
There must be something in here.

2989
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:12,420
I will figure this out, Mr. Poe!

2990
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:17,200
Where is it?

2991
02:01:17,860 --> 02:01:19,860
What the fuck can scare you?

2992
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:23,640
I'm even wearing a cowboy hat!

2993
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:24,700
Yee-haw!

2994
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:26,100
Yee-haw!

2995
02:01:26,440 --> 02:01:27,880
Oh my god.

2996
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:33,820
What if I just drop a fucking globe on him?

2997
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:34,820
Alright.

2998
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:38,440
No?

2999
02:01:39,860 --> 02:01:41,300
Oh, he's just annoyed.

3000
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:44,520
I'm a crazy crow!

3001
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:47,360
I'm wearing a cowboy hat!

3002
02:01:47,620 --> 02:01:49,260
I'm so fucking crazy.

3003
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:50,180
I'm so quirky.

3004
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:50,980
Hahaha!

3005
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:53,620
Hahaha!

3006
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:55,980
Oh my god.

3007
02:01:56,760 --> 02:02:00,340
Is there anything in the mansion that I can use to scare him?

3008
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:05,960
Where?

3009
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:06,780
What do I do?

3010
02:02:08,220 --> 02:02:11,660
I've never met a person that's not scared of me before.

3011
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:14,260
We have to eliminate him.

3012
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:18,220
We can't have him procreating, creating other humans like this.

3013
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:22,020
Oh, the whispers.

3014
02:02:22,060 --> 02:02:22,880
What do they mean?

3015
02:02:23,660 --> 02:02:24,620
These whispers.

3016
02:02:24,740 --> 02:02:25,720
What do they mean?

3017
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:29,300
I'm not like other crows.

3018
02:02:31,640 --> 02:02:33,960
Wait, this is actually a hard one.

3019
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:38,420
What do they mean?

3020
02:02:40,720 --> 02:02:42,440
What do they mean?

3021
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:45,380
I don't understand.

3022
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:49,280
I'm flying everywhere.

3023
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:51,460
Is this?

3024
02:02:52,540 --> 02:02:54,240
Maybe he's scared of pies.

3025
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:56,380
Maybe.

3026
02:02:56,880 --> 02:02:57,720
Oh my god!

3027
02:02:58,300 --> 02:02:59,020
Watch out!

3028
02:02:59,080 --> 02:02:59,480
A pie!

3029
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:03,700
Are you scared now?

3030
02:03:05,860 --> 02:03:06,700
Watch out!

3031
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:07,760
It's a pie!

3032
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:14,500
Alright, maybe if I put the pie in...

3033
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:17,220
Maybe if I just make more food?

3034
02:03:21,610 --> 02:03:22,090
Ow.

3035
02:03:23,490 --> 02:03:25,350
Okay, the soup doesn't like that.

3036
02:03:25,490 --> 02:03:26,790
Maybe I can grab a rat.

3037
02:03:27,050 --> 02:03:28,030
Is he scared of rats?

3038
02:03:28,050 --> 02:03:28,290
Maybe I can grab a rat.

3039
02:03:28,510 --> 02:03:28,510
Is he scared of rats?

3040
02:03:30,490 --> 02:03:31,890
It's over for you, Edgar.

3041
02:03:32,670 --> 02:03:33,890
I'm gonna grab a rat.

3042
02:03:35,430 --> 02:03:36,690
I can't grab it.

3043
02:03:36,770 --> 02:03:37,370
I'm stuck.

3044
02:03:37,730 --> 02:03:38,190
No!

3045
02:03:39,730 --> 02:03:42,170
Do not let her cook.

3046
02:03:43,410 --> 02:03:43,990
Do not let her cook.

3047
02:03:45,270 --> 02:03:47,650
It's so sad to scare him!

3048
02:03:48,490 --> 02:03:51,030
But I don't know what he's scared of!

3049
02:03:52,910 --> 02:03:56,130
I tried to grab this but it won't let me grab!

3050
02:03:58,230 --> 02:04:00,310
I tried to knock it off!

3051
02:04:00,710 --> 02:04:01,290
Boom!

3052
02:04:01,710 --> 02:04:03,410
I even pooped on it!

3053
02:04:05,870 --> 02:04:07,450
Can't grab the white sheet!

3054
02:04:08,990 --> 02:04:10,010
The mirror?

3055
02:04:11,850 --> 02:04:13,890
Is he gonna be scared of his own reflection?

3056
02:04:15,270 --> 02:04:16,870
Is he gonna be scared of his own reflection?

3057
02:04:22,140 --> 02:04:24,680
It was the window.

3058
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,060
I didn't even realize that was a window.

3059
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:28,900
I did it!

3060
02:04:29,940 --> 02:04:32,160
I fucking did it!

3061
02:04:33,160 --> 02:04:35,000
It's the fucking window!

3062
02:04:35,900 --> 02:04:37,740
Alright, we're gonna see this time.

3063
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,100
What do the poems say?

3064
02:04:40,900 --> 02:04:41,800
Hello, Edgar.

3065
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:43,460
That's right.

3066
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:45,880
Hello, Edgar.

3067
02:04:45,980 --> 02:04:47,640
You know what would be scary?

3068
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:50,080
Your veggies!

3069
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:53,960
No!

3070
02:04:54,180 --> 02:04:55,460
Not the veggies!

3071
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:00,080
Not the veggies!

3072
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:02,280
That's right.

3073
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:05,840
Your house is haunted by croaky!

3074
02:05:10,340 --> 02:05:11,300
That's right.

3075
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:24,100
That's right.

3076
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:27,620
Wouldn't it be a shame if...

3077
02:05:27,620 --> 02:05:28,600
The lights went out!

3078
02:05:28,740 --> 02:05:29,420
Oh shit, sorry.

3079
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:35,300
Wouldn't it be the shame if...

3080
02:05:35,300 --> 02:05:37,040
Your light source is gone!

3081
02:05:45,290 --> 02:05:45,930
Gross!

3082
02:05:49,950 --> 02:05:52,590
It's only the kitchen left.

3083
02:05:53,170 --> 02:05:54,370
Oh man!

3084
02:05:55,450 --> 02:05:57,950
Wouldn't it be a shame if...

3085
02:05:57,950 --> 02:05:59,790
Wait, what do I do here?

3086
02:06:00,530 --> 02:06:01,130
I...

3087
02:06:01,130 --> 02:06:02,310
I actually don't know.

3088
02:06:02,810 --> 02:06:03,690
What do I...

3089
02:06:03,690 --> 02:06:06,030
What do I do with this?

3090
02:06:07,510 --> 02:06:08,110
What?

3091
02:06:10,430 --> 02:06:12,390
The food's already contaminated.

3092
02:06:12,390 --> 02:06:13,850
What more does it need?

3093
02:06:14,670 --> 02:06:15,410
Wait, what?

3094
02:06:15,730 --> 02:06:18,810
What more does the food need?

3095
02:06:19,150 --> 02:06:20,170
It's already green!

3096
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:23,050
I don't even need to do anything to that food!

3097
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:26,130
The spoon?

3098
02:06:26,410 --> 02:06:26,950
Oh.

3099
02:06:27,950 --> 02:06:28,610
What if...

3100
02:06:28,610 --> 02:06:31,010
The pot suddenly stirred itself!

3101
02:06:31,390 --> 02:06:31,870
Oh, okay.

3102
02:06:31,970 --> 02:06:32,430
It's not that.

3103
02:06:32,830 --> 02:06:33,710
It's not that.

3104
02:06:33,890 --> 02:06:34,150
Alright.

3105
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:35,750
I'll figure it out soon.

3106
02:06:37,770 --> 02:06:38,990
Apparently it's not that.

3107
02:06:39,110 --> 02:06:40,270
What the fuck do I do?

3108
02:06:41,070 --> 02:06:42,590
It's not the fucking pie!

3109
02:06:44,670 --> 02:06:45,850
That didn't work.

3110
02:06:46,370 --> 02:06:47,490
Yeah, it didn't work.

3111
02:06:48,330 --> 02:06:50,770
It has to be something with the cauldron because it's green.

3112
02:06:50,870 --> 02:06:51,050
Oh!

3113
02:06:58,740 --> 02:07:01,010
It was the glass of the...

3114
02:07:01,010 --> 02:07:02,490
Find a spooky costume?

3115
02:07:02,770 --> 02:07:05,590
Oh, this is over for you, Edgar Allan Poe.

3116
02:07:06,090 --> 02:07:07,730
It's over for you.

3117
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:20,840
I am a ghost that you can this cat see through.

3118
02:07:25,420 --> 02:07:26,020
Yee-haw!

3119
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:28,200
I did it!

3120
02:07:31,280 --> 02:07:33,460
It's a g-g-g-g-g-g-ghost!

3121
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:36,040
Yay!

3122
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:37,220
We did it!

3123
02:07:38,780 --> 02:07:40,380
We beat the game!

3124
02:07:46,100 --> 02:07:46,700
Nevermore.

3125
02:07:54,360 --> 02:07:55,740
We beat the game!

3126
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:01,440
We're not the bad guys.

3127
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:03,220
We made him famous now.

3128
02:08:03,780 --> 02:08:07,180
Without me, Edgar Allan Poe would have died poor.

3129
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:10,360
Now he's... well, he's still sort of died poor.

3130
02:08:10,660 --> 02:08:13,660
But like... but like, people remember him now.

3131
02:08:16,700 --> 02:08:19,800
I mean, he was so depressed and poor, but like...

3132
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:22,220
but like, hey, at least he's famous now.

3133
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:23,200
Like...

3134
02:08:25,820 --> 02:08:28,260
All I had to do was traumatize him.

3135
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:30,880
That's fine.

3136
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:32,680
People read his books.

3137
02:08:32,940 --> 02:08:36,260
Now high schoolers and middle schoolers have to read his books now.

3138
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:40,480
Croaky was the one who got Edgar.

3139
02:08:42,740 --> 02:08:43,680
Croaky, please.

3140
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:46,920
I made him.

3141
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:49,840
You're welcome, Mr. Poe.

3142
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:51,100
I made you.

3143
02:08:51,460 --> 02:08:52,760
Croaky made you.

3144
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:55,820
Remember your... remember your origins.

3145
02:08:57,700 --> 02:09:00,040
I basically created goth kids.

3146
02:09:00,340 --> 02:09:01,600
You're welcome, goths.

3147
02:09:03,200 --> 02:09:05,320
You're welcome, goths and emo.

3148
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:08,420
Edgar Allan Poe was the first goth kid.

3149
02:09:08,660 --> 02:09:10,700
And it's all because of Croaky.

3150
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:13,360
What the fuck is... oh, okay.

3151
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:13,660
We beat the game.

3152
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:14,760
We beat the game, guys!

3153
02:09:18,450 --> 02:09:19,250
Howdy, partner.

3154
02:09:22,710 --> 02:09:24,750
Oh, my God, we did it, guys.

3155
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:26,530
We beat the game.

3156
02:09:30,270 --> 02:09:31,370
Oh, my God.

3157
02:09:32,110 --> 02:09:36,210
I gotta drink some... some doking tequila.

3158
02:09:41,190 --> 02:09:44,250
Let me grab chat in real quick.

3159
02:09:45,990 --> 02:09:47,430
Oh, yeah, for those who...

3160
02:09:48,350 --> 02:09:54,970
For those who didn't... were not there for the beginning of the stream, I found a cool feature that I would like to show you guys.

3161
02:09:56,190 --> 02:09:57,610
Um, right here.

3162
02:09:58,190 --> 02:10:00,850
Ba-da-ba-da-bum, ba-da-bum-bum.

3163
02:10:01,030 --> 02:10:02,990
Ba-da-da-da-ba-da-ba-da-dum.

3164
02:10:03,130 --> 02:10:06,090
Ba-da-ba-da-da-ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

3165
02:10:06,310 --> 02:10:09,470
Da-da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

3166
02:10:09,470 --> 02:10:11,190
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

3167
02:10:11,330 --> 02:10:14,290
Ba-da-da-da-ba-da-da-da-da-da-na-na-na-na-na.

3168
02:10:14,290 --> 02:10:16,010
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-bum.

3169
02:10:16,010 --> 02:10:17,470
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba.

3170
02:10:17,550 --> 02:10:19,130
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-bum.

3171
02:10:19,330 --> 02:10:20,750
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba.

3172
02:10:22,270 --> 02:10:24,150
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba.

3173
02:10:24,210 --> 02:10:27,670
Anyway, that was my rendition of Bad Tomato.

3174
02:10:33,330 --> 02:10:35,750
I just... I wanted to show that.

3175
02:10:35,970 --> 02:10:38,170
I wanted to show...

3176
02:10:38,170 --> 02:10:41,070
I wanted to show Bad Tomato.

3177
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:42,870
Um, but yeah!

3178
02:10:43,050 --> 02:10:43,850
That was fun!

3179
02:10:44,290 --> 02:10:46,890
I had a great time playing Jaws Crow things.

3180
02:10:47,190 --> 02:10:51,610
And I hope you guys had a great time watching me play.

3181
02:10:52,270 --> 02:10:52,710
Um...

3182
02:10:53,230 --> 02:10:55,330
It's a little bit of a shorter stream than you...

3183
02:10:55,330 --> 02:10:58,010
I mean, I did a lot of, like, 6-hour streams today.

3184
02:10:58,130 --> 02:10:59,210
Like, up this week.

3185
02:10:59,450 --> 02:11:03,010
So, like, this was a nice little, like, palette, like, cleanser.

3186
02:11:03,190 --> 02:11:05,850
A nice little chill hours with CrowKey.

3187
02:11:06,230 --> 02:11:07,850
Um, but I had a great time!

3188
02:11:08,050 --> 02:11:10,090
The very first 1440p stream.

3189
02:11:10,390 --> 02:11:13,570
I hope, like, the quality has increased a lot.

3190
02:11:13,570 --> 02:11:15,430
And I hope that it works for Wukong.

3191
02:11:15,610 --> 02:11:16,950
I might do another, like...

3192
02:11:16,950 --> 02:11:19,670
I'm definitely gonna do another, like, self, like, private test stream.

3193
02:11:19,750 --> 02:11:21,190
See if it helps with Wukong.

3194
02:11:21,450 --> 02:11:22,770
Like, the quality-wise.

3195
02:11:23,090 --> 02:11:30,730
But, like, I don't like how I used just Crow things as, like, the first 1440p stream.

3196
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:36,560
The first HD stream.

3197
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:38,720
With CrowKey.

3198
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:42,480
Oh my god.

3199
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:43,780
But maybe now.

3200
02:11:43,820 --> 02:11:45,680
My 1440p debut.

3201
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:48,880
Maybe now.

3202
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,980
The quality would be a lot better now.

3203
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:53,320
Um, but yeah!

3204
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:54,600
Thank you everybody for watching!

3205
02:11:54,980 --> 02:11:56,280
I hope you guys had a great time.

3206
02:11:56,520 --> 02:11:58,600
Um, enjoying the CrowKey hours.

3207
02:11:58,940 --> 02:12:00,960
Um, as always, everybody...

3208
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:01,940
KAKA!

3209
02:12:06,950 --> 02:12:07,990
Stay hydrated.

3210
02:12:08,310 --> 02:12:08,510
KA!

3211
02:12:09,250 --> 02:12:11,230
And then, as always, everybody...

3212
02:12:11,230 --> 02:12:12,310
Stay hydrated.

3213
02:12:12,870 --> 02:12:13,670
Posture check.

3214
02:12:13,890 --> 02:12:16,690
Sorry, this was a translation for what I just said.

3215
02:12:16,690 --> 02:12:17,670
Stay hydrated.

3216
02:12:17,990 --> 02:12:18,570
Posture check.

3217
02:12:18,570 --> 02:12:20,050
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3218
02:12:20,210 --> 02:12:22,150
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

3219
02:12:22,350 --> 02:12:23,630
Because you deserve it.

3220
02:12:23,710 --> 02:12:24,430
Yes, I'm bilingual.

3221
02:12:26,710 --> 02:12:28,410
I'm very fluent in Crowlish.

3222
02:12:29,170 --> 02:12:29,570
Um...

3223
02:12:30,270 --> 02:12:30,670
Anyway.

3224
02:12:30,790 --> 02:12:31,390
Bye-bye everybody!
