1
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,850
Hellooo everybody!

2
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:51,570
Hello!

3
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,750
Sorry!

4
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,170
Sorry I was a little late there guys.

5
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,890
Oh my gosh, chat's dead.

6
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,910
Chat, why are you dead?

7
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,490
What did you guys do?

8
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,050
How did you guys die already?

9
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,990
Okay, give me a sec.

10
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,850
I gotta revive chat.

11
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:11,570
Oh my gosh, okay my favorite part was just like seeing you guys be like...

12
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:16,950
The like differences where one half was like, she hates us!

13
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,490
And then the intro started and then there's a guy right below was just clapping.

14
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,390
Like, yay!

15
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,890
Because the intro was playing.

16
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,950
And you guys were like, yay!

17
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,850
Oh my gosh.

18
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,130
Sorry for starting off late there.

19
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,550
I actually...

20
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:59,850
I had a oh, I'll just got back from a meet-and-greet the Anime Expo meet-and-greet and funny thing about it was that um the My event manager and I thought it was at 1 p.m, because all the other stuff was at 1 p.m It was like the panel was at 1 p.m.

21
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:09,430
And then like the karaoke was at 1 p.m, and then like okay No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no it's not that I can't read!

22
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,350
It's not that I can't read.

23
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,330
Look, it was...

24
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:11,550
We...

25
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,130
I'm a good soldier, I follow orders.

26
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:24,210
And then later on, I woke up early and I was like, okay I'm ready for the tech rehearsal.

27
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,010
And then my staff was like, sorry Doki, it was actually 4.

28
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,350
And I was like, what?

29
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:30,930
1-1-4?

30
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,870
What do you mean?

31
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,830
It's been 1 this entire time!

32
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,410
1-1-4?

33
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,390
And so, I was like, can we do it early?

34
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,650
If Dragoons got there early, we could start it early.

35
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,650
So then we started it early.

36
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:04,890
We started the thing early, so then we actually ended it around 5.

37
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,330
So I was like, oh thank god.

38
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,510
We actually made it in time!

39
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,690
And like, we met everybody that won the lottery to do the meet and greet.

40
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,050
So obviously, thank you for the 10 get the shits.

41
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:17,370
Thank you!

42
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,050
I really appreciate it.

43
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:25,150
Oh my gosh, for one of them was going to be a doctor.

44
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,010
One of the Dragoons is going to be a doctor.

45
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,110
I met a doctor Dragoon.

46
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,650
It's soon to be Dr. Dragoon.

47
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,990
She's going to raise the IQ average!

48
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,490
She's going to raise our IQ!

49
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,230
Collective IQ average, guys!

50
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,650
There's a Dragoon that can read!

51
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,910
We have a Dragoon that can read!

52
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,050
It's possible!

53
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,390
Thank the Lord!

54
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,150
She can read!

55
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,450
She's going to carry us, guys!

56
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,490
She's going to carry us!

57
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,650
Who do you think... who does she think she is?

58
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,030
Learning to read!

59
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,430
Okay, I'm going to open the window right now.

60
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,690
It's like... oh wait, the window is open.

61
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,590
Okay, that's bad!

62
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:32,530
Alright, so we do have... alright, so for those who don't know, we have an SMP now.

63
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,950
And so we have a Minecraft server that is basically for Dragoons.

64
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:45,110
It took a couple of... it took a couple of months to do because there was some coding stuff that they had to do.

65
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,270
Regarding... so this server is going to be like an ongoing server.

66
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,590
It's going to be an ongoing project.

67
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,710
So in that way, we're going to improve more and more of it.

68
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:05,590
But it's at the stage... it's at the point of stage where we can finally open it!

69
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,970
So I'm really excited.

70
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,490
There are factions.

71
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,790
So there's factions involved.

72
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,690
And so you can separate yourselves into teams.

73
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,670
And it is four teams.

74
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:23,110
This server is only... they'll only open to member... member goons.

75
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,570
Because like... it's been something I've wanted to do for a very long time.

76
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:34,270
Like longer than... I think like... I'm pretty sure some of you Dragoons remember me talking about how I really wanted to do something like this.

77
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,750
And I'm really happy that I can now.

78
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,330
This team that I've hired to make this server...

79
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:45,610
They've actually done a lot of projects for like other... other like big YouTubers.

80
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,190
Other big Minecraft YouTubers.

81
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,650
As well as like tournaments and stuff for the Minecraft community.

82
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,310
So like I trust them a lot to make this a long... ongoing thing.

83
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,390
So the server will be open forever.

84
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,850
I mean not forever but like you know what I mean.

85
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,250
But like... it's going to be online for like... like months and months.

86
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,190
Like already paid for everything.

87
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,330
So... so you can log in at any time.

88
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,190
There's only 250 slots though.

89
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,030
There's only 250 slots of active players.

90
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,490
So you can log in at any time.

91
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,610
Like even though... like but like...

92
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,150
There can only be 250 players on at the same time.

93
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,630
And so we have a whitelist as well.

94
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:34,110
In the future we are going... we're going to upgrade 250 to 300.

95
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,090
In the future.

96
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,130
And... another thing that we're going to do is that...

97
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,870
We are going to have a Discord server.

98
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,190
That's just for this Minecraft server.

99
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,270
So the Discord server will be synced up with your YouTube membership.

100
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,470
So like when... if you have a YouTube membership.

101
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,550
You'll automatically be able to join the server.

102
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,370
To like be whitelisted into the Minecraft server.

103
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,210
That's still like in the works at the moment.

104
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,410
So we're doing it very like unga bunga caveman style.

105
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,250
Where you just post your username.

106
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,210
You post your username in the community post and everything.

107
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,470
And then like you get whitelisted.

108
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,670
We're like doing it by hand.

109
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,530
Like the whitelist is by hand at the moment.

110
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,070
So yes.

111
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:20,170
We will be like updating this whitelist every month.

112
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,470
So like obviously like if your membership expires.

113
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,590
Then we're going to have to...

114
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,570
Because this is reserved for like members and stuff.

115
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,150
We don't want a way for like...

116
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,610
You know have like the whitelist being leaked or anything.

117
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:33,670
And stuff like that.

118
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,710
And there are rules to the server.

119
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,530
And we also have commands.

120
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,750
If you look at the community post.

121
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,670
The members community post.

122
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,050
We have teleportation.

123
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,110
We have teleport commands.

124
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,710
If you have...

125
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,670
Because you can claim land.

126
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,750
So to prevent griefing.

127
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,850
You can claim lands.

128
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,590
And like give permission to people.

129
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,530
To like do stuff on your land.

130
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,590
And then like...

131
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,910
Oh my God.

132
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,530
I feel like some of you guys gonna start selling land.

133
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:01,970
What?

134
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:11,170
The real estate next to Doki's house is gonna go up by so much.

135
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,530
There's gonna be a town that forms around whichever land I claim.

136
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,230
Anyway, you can claim a total of 100 chunks of land.

137
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,810
And you can set three different places as your home.

138
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,170
So you can TP to your home.

139
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,070
We also have resource worlds.

140
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,430
So you don't have to farm the main world.

141
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,070
All you have to do is slash teleport resource.

142
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:44,410
All you have to do is slash teleport resource and you'll be transported to the resource world.

143
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,950
Which will...

144
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,810
Which will...

145
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,510
What's the word?

146
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,570
Is 100 chunks too huge?

147
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,150
I mean I could change it right now.

148
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,710
Guys, should we make it 50?

149
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,090
I could tell them right now to change it to 50.

150
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,090
I just bought more land.

151
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,390
Alright, I'll tell them right now.

152
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,490
Can we change?

153
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,310
Can we change it to 50 chunks?

154
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,350
No!

155
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,130
Chunks instead of 100 people are saying.

156
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,470
Look, we're like figuring this out as we go along.

157
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,190
100 is too much.

158
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,630
My land!

159
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,070
No!

160
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,080
Not my land!

161
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,570
Not my land!

162
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,490
No, keep it to 100 so I can sell the land.

163
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,950
Alright guys, I'm editing.

164
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,690
It's now at 50 chunks.

165
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,530
Guys, like I said, we can edit the rules as we go along.

166
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,030
Get my free real estate.

167
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,970
Alright, anyway.

168
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,430
So, alright.

169
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,650
The thing is...

170
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,650
The guy said that we've already made the change.

171
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,830
They've already made this change.

172
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,790
Anyway.

173
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:20,210
So, another thing is that you claim land and you teleport and set places to things.

174
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,770
Like you can teleport to...

175
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:26,130
And you can actually like request teleportation to other players.

176
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,790
But like they have to accept it basically.

177
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,650
They have to accept...

178
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,310
All the commands are in the community post.

179
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,810
So if you guys are like, oh what are the commands and everything.

180
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,550
There's also like private PMs, DMs that you can send to other players.

181
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,830
And also there are like you can...

182
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,850
Apparently if you do slash sit, you can sit down.

183
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,630
You will be handed three items when you start.

184
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,690
Those three items are related to like claiming lands.

185
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,450
But it just makes it easier in terms of like if you don't want to do the command system.

186
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,610
You don't want to do the command system.

187
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:07,610
You can use the items to command to instead of the command like the slash commands and stuff.

188
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,810
We also have rules.

189
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,310
We have rules to the server.

190
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:17,250
So obviously for the grand opening, there's no RDM.

191
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,330
What is RDM?

192
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,950
RDM is like no random killing of other members because we want to have like fun.

193
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,010
Everybody have fun.

194
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,370
So no random killing.

195
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,370
If you random kill, we're kicking you out.

196
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,350
We're kicking you out because a lot of people want to get into the 250 slots.

197
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:36,750
So like if somebody complains and they got randomly killed for no reason.

198
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,050
You will be kicked and then a person will take your place.

199
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,490
Because we have a queue system going in.

200
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,890
So yes, do not build any lag machines.

201
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,930
If we find out you build a lag machine, you're kicked.

202
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,130
You're kicked out of the server.

203
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,730
And don't make like...

204
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,010
giant ass farms that could lag the server.

205
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,870
Like it could be like medium or small size.

206
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,490
But no like you know those farms that you make a fucking PC.

207
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,280
But for the grand opening, the grand opening we're gonna be like a bit...

208
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,720
We're gonna be pretty strict on these rules.

209
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,020
Because there's gonna be a lot of dragoons.

210
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,780
We're gonna be able to have a lot of dragoons on at the same time.

211
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,400
So that's why we're gonna be a little...

212
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,140
We're gonna be a bit more strict going in at the moment for the stream.

213
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,100
Anyway guys...

214
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,620
I'm super excited because this is like I said a very ongoing project.

215
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,420
That we're planning on...

216
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,160
We're planning on upgrading and...

217
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,640
We're planning on upgrading and adding more stuff to it.

218
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,520
We're gonna be changing the main lobby a bit.

219
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,160
Because like we were expecting this to be done before my skinsuit debut.

220
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,420
So like there's gonna be stuff that's gonna be tweaked obviously as we go on.

221
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,860
At the moment, factions wise...

222
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,980
Um...

223
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,360
There's no like...

224
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,680
You don't get like specific benefits for joining a particular faction.

225
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,260
All factions are equal.

226
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,760
And...

227
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,260
But when as soon as you...

228
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,720
If you wanna be like a wild dragoon with no faction...

229
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,580
You just...

230
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,860
If you claim a faction, you can't unclaim a faction.

231
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,980
You can swap factions at any time though.

232
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,980
You can swap factions at any time.

233
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,140
Um...

234
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:26,840
But...

235
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,940
You can't unfaction yourself.

236
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,880
So...

237
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,900
Uh...

238
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,560
If you don't wanna be in a faction, you have to not press any button.

239
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,860
All dragoons are created equally.

240
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
So like...

241
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,760
I don't know.

242
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,780
If something happens where some dragoons believe they are the superior dragoon...

243
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,140
That is like not my fault.

244
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,940
Like...

245
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,300
Uh...

246
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,140
I literally said all dragoons are created...

247
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,860
No, there's no like benefit being in one faction over the other.

248
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,640
So...

249
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:08,180
There's literally like no benefit in being like in a specific dragoon role.

250
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Like they're all...

251
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,900
You guys don't get anything special by joining one faction over the other.

252
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,400
It's just how you feel.

253
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,440
All right.

254
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:19,720
Anyway...

255
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,020
Uh...

256
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:20,720
So...

257
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,700
This is the...

258
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,780
This is basically the...

259
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,320
Uh...

260
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,920
The...

261
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,340
There's three of these.

262
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,340
There's three of these.

263
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,360
You're all...

264
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,720
Oh my god.

265
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,520
What is this fucking Teletubbies, son?

266
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:32,900
Okay.

267
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,720
Okay.

268
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,000
I love the sun.

269
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,940
For this.

270
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,120
Anyway...

271
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,820
Um...

272
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,340
So there's the egg faction.

273
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,260
The...

274
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,700
Uh...

275
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,600
Regular goon.

276
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,000
The chunky goon.

277
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,620
And the long goon.

278
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,720
There is like three of these.

279
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,060
So you spawn into three separate areas for this.

280
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,240
And...

281
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,780
Uh...

282
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,520
Because like we don't want to have too many people in like...

283
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,300
Um...

284
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,380
There at the same time.

285
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,240
And you guys get to claim your faction.

286
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,720
We do have a voice mod on the server.

287
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,020
But I don't have it installed.

288
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:05,620
Uh...

289
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,700
Because I know it's gonna get super chaotic with 250 people here.

290
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,500
But like if you do wanna like have voice mod on, feel free...

291
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:12,920
It has...

292
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,460
It's proximity.

293
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,860
I put the link on it in the description in the community post.

294
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,680
Anyway, I think we're ready.

295
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,140
Good luck everybody.

296
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,120
Uh...

297
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,580
We are ready.

298
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:24,760
We are ready.

299
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,680
Oh wait.

300
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:25,920
Sorry.

301
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,620
We are ready.

302
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,180
Open.

303
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,020
Open the gates.

304
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:33,940
07.

305
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh my god.

306
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,540
It is open.

307
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,960
Oh my god!

308
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,980
There you are!

309
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,040
Halloween!

310
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,420
Oh my god.

311
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,880
Look at it.

312
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,320
There's so many people here.

313
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,920
Oh my god!

314
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,300
Oh my god!

315
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,220
We're all... okay.

316
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,500
I don't know.

317
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,940
There are 343 players!

318
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,860
How's there 300?

319
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,820
How's there 300 people?

320
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,540
Oh my god!

321
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,500
How?

322
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,480
Oh my god!

323
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,400
Selection mode disabled!

324
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:16,960
Disabled!

325
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,820
Okay, guys.

326
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,840
I need to figure out how to mute chat.

327
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,900
Let me in!

328
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,300
Let me in!

329
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,920
Give me a sec.

330
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,900
I need to message them.

331
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,740
How to...

332
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,660
How to mute the chat.

333
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,860
There's a lot of people talking.

334
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,740
Oh my god!

335
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,400
Oh my god!

336
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,760
I'm mute!

337
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:53,840
Alright!

338
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,940
Okay.

339
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,160
We see people have already selected their factions.

340
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,000
Help us!

341
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,800
Congratulations to like the people that made it.

342
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,360
Oh my god!

343
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,600
Oh my god!

344
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,560
There's so many people here!

345
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,420
There's so many people here!

346
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,660
Alright.

347
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,500
Option.

348
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:20,920
Top.

349
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,200
Oh!

350
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,140
I can toggle.

351
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:22,880
Okay, guys.

352
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,180
I'm getting... I'm being taught Minecraft right now.

353
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:25,960
Options.

354
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,260
Chat settings.

355
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,540
Oh my god!

356
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:28,980
Guys!

357
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,540
I'm figuring this out!

358
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,320
Can toggle from chat shown.

359
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,420
Oh!

360
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,860
Okay.

372
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:52,980
Hidden.

373
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,100

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,600

385
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,820
You guys can all talk.

386
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,280
You guys can all talk.

Head to 00 for the main lobby.

393
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,280
You gotta run here.

394
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,660
I couldn't...

395
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,640
After...

396
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,620
So, we're gonna be redecorating this into a saloon later.

397
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,620
To like a...

398
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,660
A Yeehaw town in the future.

399
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:06,580
This was made during... During like when we were trying to decide what to do during RetroDoki's time.

400
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,380
But this will be redecorated to Yeehaw land in the future.

401
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,580
So like the main area will be a saloon.

402
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,060
Obviously, this one's just like your house now.

403
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,800
It looks like a dragoon.

404
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,080
Um...

405
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,360
Um... But yes!

406
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,040
I'm gonna wait until like a...

407
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,500
Um... A horde of dragoons come in.

408
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,060
I'm gonna wait...

409
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,420
Oh, is there motion blur on?

410
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,160
Oh my gosh.

411
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,180

00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,640
Um... Everything related to Minecraft.

414
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,700
Because like my thing fucked up.

415
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,220
Like I couldn't talk because there was like privacy settings.

416
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,180
So I had to uninstall everything.

417
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,660
Where... Where can I adjust the motion blur?

418
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,700
I hate motion blur.

419
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,340
Where... Where is it?

420
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,920
Where's the motion blur?

421
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,880
Where is it guys?

422
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,740
Is it in shader... Shader pack?

423
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,780
Uh... No.

424
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,300
Is it the shader pack settings?

425
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,960
Custom.

426
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,940
Advanced settings.

427
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,840
Oh my gosh.

428
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,380
I don't know.

429
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,240
There's so many...

430
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,860
There's too many words.

431
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,040
Guys, there's so many words.

432
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,620
Which... Which one is it?

433
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,340

434
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,540

435
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,560
Oh, there we go.

436
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,500

437
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,000
There we go.

438
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,640
I couldn't tell right now.

439
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,500
I'm just overwhelmed.

440
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,580
Um... Do we get priority?

441
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,340
Whitelist?

442
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,900

443
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,100

Thank you so much.

451
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,340
Alright.

452
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,520
That should work, right?

453
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,260
Alright.

454
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:43,960
So there's motion blur?

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,300
No, there isn't.

456
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,640
Guys, it's at 0, 0.

457
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,860

458
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,580

00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,520

461
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,180
Did I... Did I fix it?

462
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,380
I can't tell.

463
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,220
I can't tell.

464
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,980

465
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,040

467
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,000
Oh my god.

468
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,200
We spawned at 10k.

469
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,100
We're like 9,000 blocks away.

470
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,120
Alright.

471
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,080
Good luck, dragons.

472
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,340
Good luck.

473
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,200
Holy shit.

474
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,520
You guys spawned 10k away from us?

475
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:29,920
Okay.

476
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,720
That's pretty...

477
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,500
That's pretty funny.

478
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,380
We definitely... I think I wanna do like group chats.

479
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,560
I'm gonna ask... I'm gonna ask... Can we...

480
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,060
Can we do group chats for factions in the future?

481
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,000
And like a way to make mini group chats for people.

482
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,520
So like if you guys wanna like have... That's definitely something I really wanna do.

483
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,020
It's 0, 0.

00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,180
We're at 0, 0, guys.

485
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,860
We're at 0, 0.

486
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,080
But I'm definitely... I'm asking...

487
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,640
I'm asking if we can have like group chats and faction chats.

488
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,300
And like you can do like group...

489
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,360
Like if you just wanna use voice chat.

490
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,060
You just wanna talk to people via groups.

491
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,200
That's something we can do as well.

492
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,900
Oh yeah, guys.

493
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,040

Oh yeah, by the way.

498
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,720
What's the...

499
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,040
What's the thing to show my skins again?

500
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,020
What's that sound?

501
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,000
It hurts so...

502
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,620
What's the thing where I can show you guys my skin?

503
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,000

00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:43,980
Okay, guys.

507
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,420
Look at this.

508
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,460

510
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:56,780
Oh my god.

511
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,320
They're cinematic.

512
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,660
Guys, look.

513
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,640
I skinned a bear and put a hat...

514
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,160
Okay, wait.

515
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,420
Sorry.

516
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,800

Somebody call...

518
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,620
Some people call me the...

519
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,160
The bear hunter.

520
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,580
That's fucking right.

521
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,840
One out of 86 players are sleeping.

522
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,720
Good luck with that.

523
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,340
Good luck with that.

524
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,080
Oh my god.

525
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,440
Good luck convincing the other...

526
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,020

527
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,100

00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,340
You're...

530
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,520
Wait a minute.

531
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,500
How the fuck did you have like armor already?

532
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,780
How did...

533
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,160
The first dragon to have made it over.

534
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,940
Oh my...

535
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,260
Can you already have armor?

536
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,380
Oh my...

537
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,240
Oh my god.

538
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,940

539
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,760
Okay.

Oh my god.

542
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,820
There's a...

543
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,080
There's a lot.

544
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,980
How did you get...

545
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,740
How did you get armor already?

546
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,780
Those poor dragoons are doing their trek over to like the promised land.

547
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,360
They're doing their...

548
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,720
The chosen one.

549
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,360
They're like...

550
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,820
They're like trying to head over here right now.

551
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,500
Oh my god.

552
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:28,860
Oh my god.

553
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,320
One out of 95 players.

554
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,140
Okay, I'm good.

555
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,660
Can we...

556
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:40,240
Can we also have it so that only one person needs...

557
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:50,640
Okay, how about only a percentage of people need to sleep so that the server has...

558
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,220
So that they stay.

559
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,140
Not one.

560
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,080
Because I'm wondering...

561
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,140
I think some people would want to have it to be nighttime.

562
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,360
So like maybe like one third.

563
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,720
Like one third.

564
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,320
Maybe.

565
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,340
One third is a good amount, I think.

566
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,140
One third is a good amount.

567
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,880
We only have like one drag...

568
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,160
How far is it?

569
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,900
How far are all of you guys?

570
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,340
Like 10%?

571
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,620
Okay, 10%.

572
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:20,900
10%.

573
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,020
Don't worry.

574
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,240
See, we're like...

575
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,360
We're beta testing as we go along.

576
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,900
We're beta testing now.

577
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,140
Guys!

578
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,980
Oh my god!

579
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,260
We have another dragon!

580
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,800
And Chonkygoon and the Longgoon have made it!

581
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,160
And they have iron armor!

582
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,160
Guys.

583
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:40,880
Guys.

584
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,340
Other dragoons.

585
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,580
The other dragoons are not doing so well.

586
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,660
The other...

587
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,720
You got diamond?

588
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:47,820
How?

589
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,380
Regular...

590
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:51,920
Guys.

591
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,460
We have representatives from all that...

592
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,480
All dragoons.

593
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,120
Except for the regular goon.

594
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,140
Like...

595
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,960
How does he have all the armor?

596
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,980
I mean...

597
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,480
How do you have all the armor?

598
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,320
Guys, where are the regular dragoons?

599
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:07,980
Like...

600
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,240
Where are the...

601
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,240
Where's the regular...

602
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,420
There's Chonky.

603
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,340
There's Long.

604
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,900
Oh, there he is!

605
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,220
There she is!

606
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:19,980
And you're naked!

607
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,560
Okay.

608
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,380
You're...

609
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,840
That's a regular dragoon.

610
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,340
Guys.

611
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,200
All dragoons are created equally.

612
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,960
Guys.

613
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,340
I just need you guys to know that.

614
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,100
Every dragoon here is created equally.

615
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,760
But it does say something when the only dragoon representative that's here is naked.

616
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,250
It does...

617
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,670
It does say something.

618
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,410
Regular goons are endangered.

619
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,230
But yes.

620
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,770
We have the...

621
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,530
I know the phrase.

622
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,590
They're different.

623
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,410
No, no, no.

624
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,610
Everybody is created equally.

625
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,950
I'm really excited.

626
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,410
I'm really excited to...

627
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:07,970
Anyway.

628
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:13,170
I talked to the team and they will be working on a chat system for all the dragoons.

629
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,030
Because we know there's a lot of people chatting now.

630
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,330
So you guys have to be...

631
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,990
You guys have to...

632
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,450
Oh, Slash Resource kills you over and over?

633
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,910
Okay, thanks for letting me know.

634
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,090
I'm gonna tell that to the...

635
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,610
Like I said, we're live checking it as we go along.

636
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,790
Apparently, Slash Resource keeps killing people.

637
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,170
So this is like a stress test.

638
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,790
We're stress testing everything at the moment.

639
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,290
So it's live beta testing.

640
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:53,870
But I'm really glad to finally have a server with all of you guys.

641
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,790
I'm excited to see what you guys come up with.

642
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,610
And see the things you guys are gonna build.

643
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,690
The faction wars that's gonna go on.

644
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,490
What the fuck?

645
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,570
Okay, that's a long dragoon right there.

646
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,690
Yeah,

647
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,040
that's a long dragoon right there.

648
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,580
Alright, it's gonna...

649
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,080
It's gonna take a while for the other dragoons to get here.

650
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,560
So this is gonna be the opening ceremony.

651
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,620
We have representatives from everybody.

652
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,080
From all the factions.

653
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,800
So we have representatives from everybody.

654
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:04,800
But when you guys get here, just remember to set this place as a home area.

655
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,860
Because I will be making announcements here.

656
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,260
Whenever I stream on this server or do an event here.

657
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,920
This will be the main hub.

658
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,400
No way.

659
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,140
This will be the main hub.

660
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,680
So remember to set one of your homes here.

661
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,700
You have three homes.

662
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,520
So remember to set one of them right here.

663
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,300
But it's a great time.

664
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,280
I cannot wait to see what you dragoons do.

665
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,480
We will have a better chat system for everybody.

666
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,400
To be implemented in the future.

667
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,560
If you guys do have future ideas that you want to give.

668
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,180
Regarding how the server will be run.

669
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,560
And what kind of quality of life features you guys want.

670
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,320
At the end of the stream, feel free to comment on some ideas and everything.

671
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,640
Any events you guys want.

672
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,960
Any quality of life stuff.

673
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,360
Any changes you want to see.

674
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,620
Just comment on the VOD.

675
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,260
Later on in the future.

676
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,100
After the stream ends.

677
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,540
You can comment on the VOD.

678
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,360
Anyway guys.

679
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,520
This area is 0-0.

680
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,200
So it's at exactly 0-0.

681
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,340
Now run free.

682
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,100
Run wild.

683
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,680
Start claiming land.

684
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,180
It's a free server.

685
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,480
Well not free.

686
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,980
You guys have to pay to be here.

687
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,820
But start claiming land.

688
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,120
Go.

689
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,320
Go.

690
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,240
Go.

691
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,660
Claim the land for your people.

692
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:36,820
Anyway.

693
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,160
I will claim land too.

694
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,080
Alright.

695
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,780
So I feel like people are going to start building around my town.

696
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,420
It's time.

697
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,300
Somebody feed me.

698
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,020
Alright.

699
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,000
Go forth.

700
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,020
Alright.

701
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,580
I'm going to claim a little bit of land.

702
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,160
Alright guys.

703
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:04,780
Let's see.

704
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,340
So what you can do it with this tool.

705
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:07,900
Oh wait.

706
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,520
There's a village next to us.

707
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,420
Wait.

708
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,520
That's so ideal.

709
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:12,960
Wait.

710
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,620
We have a village next to us.

711
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,160
That's so good.

712
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,880
Alright.

713
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,480
Let's see.

714
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,760
For those who are wondering what resource pack I use.

715
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,620
I use Astro.

716
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,780
Astro...

717
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,520
Astrolex.

718
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,780
I think that's what it's called.

719
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,940
What the fuck happened to that mountain?

720
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,640
Oh.

721
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,140
Okay.

722
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,000
There's an ocean here.

723
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,240
I don't want to claim there.

724
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,120
Uh.

725
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,180
No.

726
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,720
Somebody has to feed me later guys.

727
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,520
Alright.

728
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,660
I am the mayor.

729
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,020
I'm the mayor of the server.

730
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,480
No.

731
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,500
I'm the president of the server.

732
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,480
Sorry.

733
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,480
I'm in shader pack.

734
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,440
Um.

735
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:52,600
I'm in shader pack.

736
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,100
I am the president of the server guys.

737
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,800
Oh!

738
00:32:59,920 --> 00:32:59,980

741
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,480
Presidents get reelected.

742
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,400
No.

743
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,460

I am the queen of the server.

749
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,980
So that means like I'm in power forever.

750
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,520
You can't reelect the queen.

751
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,580
You can't re-elect the queen.

752
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,440
No.

753
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,380
I'm not a dictator.

754
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,060
I'm not a dictator.

755
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,300
I'm a good person.

756
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,800

757
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,520

Where the fuck?

759
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,820
Where do I wanna live?

760
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,120
I don't know where to live.

761
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,320

That's so good!

773
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,360
Oh, feel the wild.

774
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,480
Oh no, it's the PvP zone!

775
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,180
Not the PvP zone!

776
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,700
No, it's the wild!

777
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,240
Has music been playing this entire time?

778
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,520
Oh nice, okay, that's good.

00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,240

00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,080
Oh, this is gonna be my area.

Okay.

00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,680
Is this how I claim it?

791
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,860
I don't know if I'm claiming it.

792
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,480
Am I claiming it?

793
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,780
Am I doing it?

794
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,660

848
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,080
Does it work?

849
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,440
Wilderness.

850
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,980

863
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,740
Okay.

864
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,400
It's okay.

00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,940
Okay, I need more food.

884
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,700
Guys, I need to be fed.

00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,160
It's okay, guys.

887
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,020

So everything's fine.

892
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,000
Alright, so this is my land, guys.

You guys like it?

896
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,840
It's my land.

897
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,980
You guys can build a town around me.

898
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,520
One out of twenty-one.

899
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,000
Good luck.

900
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,460
None of us have beds.

901
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,520
Oh my god!

902
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,100
Two people!

903
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,000
Two people are sleeping!

904
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,420
Guys!

905
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,980
I don't have a torch, guys.

906
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,080
Wait, I need to get tools too.

907
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,540
Guys, give me a sec.

908
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,000

How do you guys do that?

916
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,000
Okay.

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,660
There's, like... I need so many things.

919
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,260
Oh my god!

920
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,040
We worked together!

921
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,540
We did the first task.

922
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,780
We worked together.

923
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,560

Alright, six.

Okay.

00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:58,570
Alright.

930
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:02,730
Welcome...

931
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,910
to... Doki Land.

932
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,670
There we go.

933
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,230
This is... this is the capital city.

934
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,030
This is...

935
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,110
This is the capital city, guys.

936
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,150
Doki Land.

937
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,490
Is the capital city.

938
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:28,910
And thus a town shall form around me.

939
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,370
And thus a town shall form around me.

940
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,910
Yes, it's still mine!

941
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:35,950
I claimed it!

942
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,230
I... You know it's mine!

943
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:40,030
Cause the moment I leave, it's the wilderness.

944
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,830
But then, I...

945
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,710
Leave here and then it's civilization.

946
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,910
It's civil...

947
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,470
Everything the light touches is mine.

948
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,270
Everything the light touches is mine.

949
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,110
It's...

950
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,770
Look, Rome started out as small.

951
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:55,950
Okay, guys?

952
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,970
Rome was a very small city.

953
00:39:59,070 --> 00:39:59,570
Okay?

954
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,630
And then it got bigger and bigger.

955
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:03,770
And then...

956
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,270
I have a bed!

957
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,730
This is pure civilization.

958
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,090
I literally have a bed.

959
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,250
I need food now.

960
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:11,730
Okay.

961
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,070
The city of...

962
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,950
Oh no, I'm in the wild now.

963
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,270
I'm in the fucking wild.

964
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,010
Rome didn't manifest out of nowhere.

965
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:23,770
Chat.

966
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,430
Like, it took years to build Rome.

967
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,430
Guys.

968
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,170
It took years.

969
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,190
Doki Land is gonna expand.

970
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,190
Okay?

971
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,870
This... We're improving on Rome.

972
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,970
We're gonna be better than Rome.

973
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,850
We're gonna be so much better than Rome.

974
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:47,310
We're gonna be so much better than Rome.

975
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,130
I need to kill a pig.

976
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,230
Cause I'm fucking starving.

977
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:49,970
Okay, wait.

978
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:50,450
Oh shit.

979
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,430
I need to go back to Doki Land.

980
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,170
My crafting here is here.

981
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,390
Doki Land wasn't built in a day, guys.

982
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:57,130
Alright?

983
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,690
We're at 1% of Doki Land.

984
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,050
We're merely 1%.

985
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:03,850
We're merely 1%.

986
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,530
If you build... Guys.

987
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:08,730
If you build around Doki Land, you gotta pay taxes.

988
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,170
Yeah.

989
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,010
Good idea.

990
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:14,770
You know what?

991
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,110
Whoever said that...

992
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:16,330
Alright.

993
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:16,790
Chest.

994
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,410
Alright.

995
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,010
Okay.

996
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,590
Which is outside of Doki Land.

997
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,310
Alright.

998
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,410
There we go.

999
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:26,910
There we go.

1000
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,250
Now you should be able to like...

1001
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,150
Uh...

1002
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,750
Tax Doki Land taxes.

1003
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:39,730
Alright.

1004
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,670
I need to build another.

1005
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:42,510
I need to...

1006
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,210
I need to build...

1007
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:45,910
Okay.

1008
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:46,630
Let's see.

1009
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,430
Boom.

1010
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:48,870
Alright.

1011
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:49,950
Good thinking.

1012
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,430
Whoever had the idea, you were so smart.

1013
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,170
Alright.

1014
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:53,630
Guys.

1015
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:54,710
If you...

1016
00:41:54,710 --> 00:42:00,270
If you build around Doki Land, you gotta pay the Doki Land taxes.

1017
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:06,110
You have to pay the Doki Land taxes.

1018
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,490
I...

1019
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:08,910
Yes.

1020
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,470
Are you here to feed me?

1021
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,030
Feed me.

1022
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:14,870
Wait.

1023
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,590
I don't have a... I don't have a fucking furnace.

1024
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,370
Like...

1025
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,570
You think I have rocks?

1026
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,990
You think I have coal?

1027
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,270
Feed me coal.

1028
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,290
What do you mean?

1029
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,430
I don't have coal.

1030
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,530
I don't...

1031
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:36,410
Alright.

1032
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:37,470
Okay.

1033
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,450
I needed... I was gonna make materials.

1034
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,750
I was gonna make tools.

1035
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:41,510
I wasn't gonna...

1036
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,070
I wasn't gonna leech.

1037
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,030
Guys.

1038
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,470
I know how to Minecraft.

1039
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,150
Uh...

1040
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,690
I'm not gonna eat raw meat.

1041
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:49,690
My god.

1042
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:52,010
Cesar wouldn't have to eat raw meat.

1043
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:55,810
Whoa.

1044
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:56,890
Nice.

1045
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,230
I found diamonds, guys.

1046
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:02,210
Uh... Here's my Doki Land taxes.

1047
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,790
Oh, god.

1048
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,810
Oh, my god.

1049
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,530
The taxes almost killed me.

1050
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,990
Greed almost got me.

1051
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,770
Um... Maxwell, thank you for the super chat.

1052
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:18,270
Thank you.

1053
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:18,950
Thank you.

1054
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:20,770
Oh, yeah.

1055
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:21,410
Berries.

1056
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:23,350
Oh, my god.

1057
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,590
I can put berries...

1058
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:27,210
I can put berries around.

1059
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:28,450
Hello, guys.

1060
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:32,510
Are you here to pay tribute to Doki Land?

1061
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:33,590
Alright.

1062
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:34,510
Let's see.

1063
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:35,990
I'm gonna put this around the taxes.

1064
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:37,350
Oh, shit.

1065
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,710
That's not what I wanted.

1066
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:39,730
I only wanted to eat.

1067
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,010
I don't want it to eat.

1068
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:43,730
Alright.

1069
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,210
Nice.

1070
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,950
How the fuck did you guys find all of this stuff?

1071
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:49,250
Okay.

1072
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,210
I hope someone builds like a coliseum.

1073
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:53,010
Oh, my god!

1074
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:55,990
Oh, my god!

1075
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,530
Guys, I found diamonds!

1076
00:43:59,310 --> 00:43:59,790
Okay.

1077
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:00,670
I think I need...

1078
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,250
Okay.

1079
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:02,130
Not again.

1080
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:02,870
Okay.

1081
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:05,910
Alright.

1082
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:11,510
I'm gonna need some fucking... I need some fucking... Oh, my god.

1083
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,310
I'm being fed.

1084
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:15,390
Alright.

1085
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:16,010
Let's see.

1086
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:16,970
Alright, guys.

1087
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:18,450
Remember to put your taxes here.

1088
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:22,330
If you guys want to give me anything because you're getting taxed.

1089
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:23,210
Uh...

1090
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:24,770
Let's see.

1091
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,890
I need to build a furnace.

1092
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:28,830
Furnace time.

1093
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:29,990
Furnace.

1094
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:32,550
I can't wait to see what you guys build, though.

1095
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:33,690
Uh...

1096
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:36,510
And then I need...

1097
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:37,070
Oh, my gosh.

1098
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,550
I still need to...

1099
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,470
Alright.

1100
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:39,830
Boom.

1101
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:40,530
Alright.

1102
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,870
It's time to find... Has anyone donated coal yet?

1103
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:44,110
No.

1104
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,530
They've only given me... What am I gonna do with bread?

1105
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:52,030
You think I'm a bread leader?

1106
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:53,530
Guys!

1107
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,390
I am a queen!

1108
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:02,130
You think queens live off bread?

1109
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,090
Oh, my god.

1110
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:08,390
Coal.

1111
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:09,490
Nice.

1112
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:09,970
Okay.

1113
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,230
I'm gonna grab...

1114
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:12,710
Uh...

1115
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,370
Bread is for peasants!

1116
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:18,850
Damn right!

1117
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,030
Bread is for peasants!

1118
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,150
You're gonna give me bread?

1119
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:25,150
Alright.

1120
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:25,710
Let's...

1121
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:26,750
Uh...

1122
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:28,250
Bread.

1123
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:28,490
Yeah.

1124
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:30,150
Bread is actually really bad for broods.

1125
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,110
I don't know if you guys know that.

1126
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:31,670
Uh...

1127
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:32,110
I don't know if you guys know that.

1128
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:33,870
Alright.

1129
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,390
Let's see.

1130
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:35,050
Doki Land.

1131
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,990
Uh... Oh, I have coal now.

1132
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,410
So... We are finally...

1133
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:41,770
Oh, my god.

1134
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:43,010
What's in my...

1135
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:44,450
Did people see... Okay.

1136
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:45,410
Oh, I have lily pads.

1137
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:45,970
Oh, my god!

1138
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,670
People... I fucking have...

1139
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:48,590
Fucking coal!

1140
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:50,230
Let's go.

1141
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:52,670
That's right!

1142
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:55,450
I've got a mud in there.

1143
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,310
For the queen.

1144
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:00,190
For the queen.

1145
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:00,650
Oh, no.

1146
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:01,350
I'm in the wild.

1147
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,150
For the queen of the server.

1148
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:05,810
For the queen of the server.

1149
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:09,370
I'm actually really interested in seeing what you guys do, though.

1150
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:09,630
I'm actually really interested in seeing what you guys do, though.

1151
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:12,250
Uh... My bread tastes so good.

1152
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:13,850
Bread is poisonous!

1153
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:16,050
To birds!

1154
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,290
What does that say about you guys?

1155
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,810
You guys wanna poison me?

1156
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,890
Look at this humble home.

1157
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,430
I'm gonna visit the peasants.

1158
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,770
Hello, peasant.

1159
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:26,210
Here you go.

1160
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:27,570
You deserve a bread.

1161
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,230
Oh, my god.

1162
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:31,630
Wait.

1163
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:32,110
I have to go.

1164
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,830
I should, like, give bread to my...

1165
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:34,970
loyal subjects.

1166
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:37,970
I'm bad at bread.

1167
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:42,450
Bread is too good... too bad for me.

1168
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:46,130
I should go feed...

1169
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,490
the poor peasants that live around Dokiland.

1170
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:51,770
That should be what I want.

1171
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,730
That should be what I do.

1172
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:54,230
You know what?

1173
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:55,110
That's a good...

1174
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,230
What the fuck?!

1175
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,030
Oh, my god.

1176
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:00,150
Remember to pay your taxes, Ozzy.

1177
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,950
Remember to pay those taxes.

1178
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:02,990
Alright.

1179
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:04,210
There's, like, a lot of bread.

1180
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:04,590
Okay.

1181
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:05,550
I'm ready to...

1182
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:06,670
I'm gonna feed the poor.

1183
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:07,970
I'm gonna...

1184
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:12,630
Don't worry!

1185
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:14,910
My humble subjects!

1186
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,710
I'm here to feed you guys!

1187
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:19,770
Oh, no.

1188
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:20,290
The wilderness.

1189
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,130
The wilderness.

1190
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:26,430
Bread is bad in Dokiland.

1191
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,150
But, like, um...

1192
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,090
I'm here...

1193
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,870
to, like, welcome...

1194
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:32,370
Hello!

1195
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,790
You poor... dragon!

1196
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:38,570
Do not worry, dragon!

1197
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:40,090
Here!

1198
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,110
Have some...

1199
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:43,270
Have some bread!

1200
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:45,170
There you go!

1201
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:46,070
You're welcome!

1202
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:47,630
You're welcome!

1203
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:54,330
Remember what the queen did for you.

1204
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:55,310
Oh, shit.

1205
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:56,030
I need a...

1206
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:58,350
I need a fucking... I forgot I need to sit at home.

1207
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,310
Um...

1208
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:00,870
I need to sit at my home.

1209
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:03,570
Guys, I need to, like, be able to teleport back to my house.

1210
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:04,290
Uh...

1211
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:07,890
Yeah, but it's raw meat!

1212
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:09,410
I have cooked food.

1213
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:12,390
I'm... I'm such a good queen.

1214
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:13,290
I'm...

1215
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,090
I'm...

1216
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:15,730
Alright.

1217
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:18,410
Let's see.

1218
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:21,270
I need to make sure I set my house.

1219
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:21,610
Oh!

1220
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:23,210
I built that too!

1221
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:23,990
Okay.

1222
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:26,430
Alright.

1223
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:27,050
Let's see.

1224
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,010
Let me...

1225
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:30,670
Set... home...

1226
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:31,990
Okay, how do I do this?

1227
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:32,950
I need to look at my command.

1228
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,250
Set home Doki Land.

1229
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:36,250
Alright, there you go.

1230
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:38,550
Uh...

1231
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,490
Set home Doki Land.

1232
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:41,750
There you go!

1233
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:42,950
That should have worked.

1234
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:44,450
Okay, nice.

1235
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:45,730
Alright, I'm gonna make sure it works.

1236
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:46,410
Give me a sec.

1237
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:47,310
Alright.

1238
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,370
Uh... T-P... Oh!

1239
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:52,790
Home... Home...

1240
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:55,270
Home Doki Land.

1241
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,030
Home Doki Land.

1242
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:58,250
I did it!

1243
00:48:58,350 --> 00:48:59,430
I did it!

1244
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:00,990
Guys...

1245
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:02,710
I have the magic power.

1246
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:05,110
Alright, let's explore...

1247
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:05,870
around me.

1248
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:07,030
Uh...

1249
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,070
Longoon Land.

1250
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:11,030
Why is there...

1251
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:12,830
Longoon Land?

1252
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:17,170
Oh my god.

1253
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:17,470
Oh my god.

1254
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:18,550
Alright, feel the wild.

1255
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:21,470
Oh my gosh, the dragons are working together and sleeping again.

1256
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,490
Go dragon, go!

1257
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,190
Make it day!

1258
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:26,050
Make it day!

1259
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:28,030
There you go.

1260
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:28,870
Thank you for the super chat.

1261
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:29,770
Thank you, thank you.

1262
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,910
I'm so glad to be able to meet you at Anime Expo.

1263
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:33,290
I'm so glad you love my Doki doll.

1264
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:34,710
I hope to see you next year.

1265
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:35,970
Thank you for all the laughter.

1266
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,110
By the way, here is my tax payment.

1267
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:38,770
Thank you!

1268
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:39,710
Thank you for the super chat.

1269
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:40,530
Thank you, thank you.

1270
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:42,730
I'm glad you had a great time at Anime Expo.

1271
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:44,050
It was great to meet you.

1272
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:46,910
Yeah, but where are the other...

1273
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:48,250
Where are the other goons?

1274
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:49,550
That set up base.

1275
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:51,090
Where are they all living?

1276
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:54,730
I have Longoon Land.

1277
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:56,150
One of many.

1278
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,770
Where do the other dragons live?

1279
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:02,690
Is there anybody living next to the village?

1280
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,650
I can't believe we have a village right next to us.

1281
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:06,470
That's so convenient.

1282
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:10,550
It's actually 7k blocks away.

1283
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:20,250
It's like the trek to Doki Land.

1284
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,350
It's like an actual adventure.

1285
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:25,810
The head chair.

1286
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:27,030
It's like the trek to Doki Land.

1287
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:29,650
The secret land of Doki.

1288
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:33,430
Making 10k blocks away.

1289
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:35,030
What the fuck?

1290
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:37,290
Is this supposed to be here?

1291
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:39,690
Who built this?

1292
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,470
Wait, who lives there?

1293
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,110
Who lives here?

1294
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:46,050
Who the fuck James A.

1295
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:46,790
claimed?

1296
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:49,670
You claimed the village?

1297
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,050
Oh, that's evil.

1298
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:54,730
Bro, he claimed an entire village.

1299
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,690
That's so evil.

1300
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:57,030
I'm so sorry.

1301
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:57,070
That's so evil.

1302
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:03,310
Oh my god.

1303
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:05,910
He actually claimed it.

1304
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:07,530
Who made this?

1305
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:08,510
This is a dock.

1306
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:11,070
What's going on here?

1307
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:13,290
Oh my god.

1308
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:13,850
What are you making?

1309
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:14,850
Chonky-kun!

1310
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:16,510
Don't worry!

1311
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:20,450
I am here as your humble queen.

1312
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,210
I am here to feed the poor.

1313
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:25,070
Here you go.

1314
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,010
You deserve it.

1315
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,270
Go at it, soldier!

1316
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,930
Kala is in the name of Doki Land.

1317
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:39,590
Look at Migo.

1318
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,230
I'm such a good queen.

1319
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:43,490
I'm making sure...

1320
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:44,910
I'm making sure...

1321
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,170
everybody has...

1322
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:53,210
Everybody has the food they need.

1323
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:54,690
To live.

1324
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:56,030
Can you there?

1325
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,850
Can you there, Cypher?

1326
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,550
Here you go!

1327
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:01,470
You deserve it!

1328
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:04,630
My poor... so poor...

1329
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:08,130
peasants that live around me in Minecraft world.

1330
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:10,810
Cypher...

1331
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:11,970
Oh shit, I pressed R.

1332
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:13,190
I actually refreshed my...

1333
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:14,650
resources back.

1334
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,770
Oh my god.

1335
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:18,270
Now I'm back in the wild.

1336
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:19,510
Wait, who lives here?

1337
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,070
Who lives here?

1338
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,490
Who lives here?

1339
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:23,750
What is this place?

1340
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:26,470
Oh my god.

1341
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,490
Nobody claimed this?

1342
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:29,190
Is this your home!?

1343
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:33,170
Is this your home!?

1344
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:35,110
U blab la.

1345
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,770
This was your home.

1346
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:45,590
Oh my God...

1347
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,580
Oh my God...

1348
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,040
This is now Doki Land 2.

1349
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,260
Welcome to Doki Land 2!

1350
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:22,740
Doki Land 2, the sequel.

1351
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,000
No!

1352
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,180
Shit, okay.

1353
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,940
Doki Land 2.

1354
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,680
It's our home now.

1355
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:40,860
Welcome!

1356
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,440
Let me rename this.

1357
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:43,440
Land...

1358
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,020
Home...

1359
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,700
Shit, how do I rename again?

1360
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:49,580
Land... rename.

1361
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,200
Okay, Land...

1362
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:53,640
Rename...

1363
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,360
Doki Land 2.

1364
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,960
Wait, does this like...

1365
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,040
Oh my god, there's a tomato?

1366
00:53:59,280 --> 00:53:59,460
Wait.

1367
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,820
Feel the wild.

1368
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,800
Does it say Doki Land still?

1369
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,240
Does it say Doki Land?

1370
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,180
Guys, I'm testing out my land real quick, guys.

1371
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,960
I'm testing out my land.

1372
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,240
Guys, give me a sec.

1373
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,480
Why is my land not showing up?

1374
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:14,720
No.

1375
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,820
Why is my land not showing up?

1376
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,760
I claimed this land fair and square.

1377
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,660
I claimed it fair and square.

1378
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,340
Where's my land?

1379
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,220
Alright, let's see.

1380
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,740
Why is my land not showing up?

1381
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,920
I claimed it!

1382
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,320
I did!

1383
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,160
I claimed it!

1384
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,220
It was my land!

1385
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,580
Oh no.

1386
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,180
Did I not claim it?

1387
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,240
Did it got unclaimed?

1388
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,580
Did my land got unclaimed?

1389
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:55,880
Give me a sec.

1390
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:58,700
Okay.

1391
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,760
There we go.

1392
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,980
Slash claim.

1393
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,140
Is mine now?

1394
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,200
Doki Land!

1395
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,280
There we go!

1396
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,240
Guys, I did it.

1397
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,160
Welcome to Doki Land.

1398
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,260
This is also Doki Land now.

1399
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,560
Guys, this is...

1400
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,400
This is Doki Land 2.

1401
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,080
They worked so hard to build it.

1402
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,580
But it's now mine.

1403
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,380
It's now mine.

1404
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,120
Eggtown.

1405
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,460
Oh my gosh.

1406
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,980
There's Eggtown.

1407
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,100
I got the Doki docks.

1408
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,640
Yeah, I need the docks, guys.

1409
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,500
Whoever controls the water controls the kingdom.

1410
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,820
You guys have to know that.

1411
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,720
If you control the water, you control the kingdom.

1412
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,600
I need to be sure that they know.

1413
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,120
That they know.

1414
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,080
Holy shit.

1415
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,740
How much would property...

1416
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:03,340
Oh wait.

1417
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,960
I should like make a sign to be like...

1418
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,780
Um...

1419
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,880
Welcome...

1420
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,960
Welcome...

1421
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,000
Uh...

1422
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,720
Somebody make a dock next to my land.

1423
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,340
I need somebody to make a ship dock next to it.

1424
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,340
Of course there's taxes.

1425
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,700
The world is filled with taxes.

1426
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,400
You think I wouldn't tax my people?

1427
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,740
I'm a queen.

1428
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,400
I'm the queen.

1429
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,920
Of course I tax people.

1430
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,000
Alright.

1431
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,520
If you come here...

1432
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:36,860
Follow the flow.

1433
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:37,540
From the ocean.

1434
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,720
I need you guys.

1435
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,320
Okay.

1436
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,460
I need a crafting table.

1437
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,320
Give me a sec.

1438
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,300
Let me make a crafting table.

1439
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,040
And then I need a chest real quick.

1440
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,000
Okay.

1441
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:49,660
Chest.

1442
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,560
Uh, oh shit.

1443
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:51,800
Okay.

1444
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:52,420
Give me a second.

1445
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,140
I need to fucking find some trees.

1446
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,160
I need to find some trees.

1447
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,740
Guys, look.

1448
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,280
Being a queen is very, very hard work.

1449
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,040
I need to make sure I have a chest.

1450
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,100
Whose place is this?

1451
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:14,560
Thank you.

1452
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,860
Oh yeah, I can do this because I'm the owner.

1453
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,520
I can actually...

1454
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,840
Other

1455
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,520
people's builds because I'm the owner.

1456
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,480
Yeah,

1457
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,960
you thought this was yours.

1458
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:45,140
That's messed up.

1459
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,880
Welcome to Doki Land.

1460
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:54,740
I can't creep other people's lands just because I'm the server owner.

1461
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,960
It's great.

1462
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,460
I love being the queen.

1463
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,780
If you... what the fuck?

1464
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,700
Alright, build me a dock.

1465
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,540
This is where the taxes will go.

1466
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:09,920
Alright, let's see.

1467
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,460
I need a sign.

1468
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:14,580
Sign.

1469
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:15,660
That's so funny.

1470
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,580
Oh, I don't have enough.

1471
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:18,880
Fuck, okay.

1472
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,180
I need more wood.

1473
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:21,960
Alright.

1474
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:24,560
I'm the HOA.

1475
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,420
I'm the HOA.

1476
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:28,540
I'm the HOA.

1477
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:31,920
That's all I need to hear.

1478
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:32,820
What?

1479
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,120
You don't trust me?

1480
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,400
He doesn't need this tree!

1481
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,700
He's already rich!

1482
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,760
He has entire town!

1483
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,940
He doesn't need this tree.

1484
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,880
This one tree.

1485
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:53,080
The HOA is back.

1486
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,920
He doesn't need it!

1487
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:01,560
Like, the queen needs it more.

1488
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,040
The queen needs this more.

1489
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,040
Alright.

1490
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,480
Okay.

1491
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:11,800
Uh... free the dragon from the taxation.

1492
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:12,760
No.

1493
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,320
No, you don't get to say that.

1494
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:19,840
Alright, don't worry.

1495
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:20,420
Okay.

1496
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:22,600
Tax time.

1497
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:24,600
Okay.

1498
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:26,400
Uh...

1499
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:30,120
Uh... how do I do this?

1500
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:31,760
Taxes.

1501
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,540
Alright, there we go.

1502
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,580
I gotta make sure.

1503
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:43,740
I gotta make sure all my dragoons live off well.

1504
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,080
Alright, let's explore more.

1505
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,300
It's fun seeing what you guys are up to.

1506
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:49,440
Uh...

1507
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,300
I gotta feed...

1508
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,140
I gotta feed the peasants around my kingdom, guys.

1509
00:59:55,560 --> 01:00:01,360
Guys, I gotta make sure the peasants that live around my kingdom are having a good time.

1510
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,720
Hello, fellow peasants!

1511
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:05,820
Hello!

1512
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:09,540
I am here to grant you...

1513
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,060
Get out of the crafting.

1514
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,920
Listen to me!

1515
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,140
I am your queen!

1516
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,860
And I am here to give you gifts.

1517
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,360
Eat!

1518
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,080
Eat!

1519
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,180
My present.

1520
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:24,140
Alright.

1521
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,200
Oh my god!

1522
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,340
Somebody's planting bamboo!

1523
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:36,830
Nice.

1524
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,330
My bamboo.

1525
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:40,690
Wait, who's building a fucking tower?

1526
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:41,590
Oh!

1527
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:42,390
Oh my...

1528
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:42,590
Woo!

1529
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:46,680
Okay.

1530
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:47,480
Alright.

1531
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,860
Um, that scared the shit out of me.

1532
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:50,620
Wait, who lives here?

1533
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,520
Did no one claim this land?

1534
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,940
Who lives here?

1535
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:58,340
Who...

1536
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:59,460
Who lives in...

1537
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,360
Wait, who lives here?

1538
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,620
This is not claimed officially.

1539
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:04,600
Oh!

1540
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,080
The...

1541
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:05,660
Okay.

1542
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,880
We're gonna leave.

1543
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,360
Take me back to the wild.

1544
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,480
Germany?

1545
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,260
What?

1546
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,280
What?

1547
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,640
Who's building a country?

1548
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:24,300
What the fuck is Germany doing here?

1549
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:27,460
Oh!

1550
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,560
Oh my gosh, my people!

1551
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,420
My people!

1552
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:32,500
Kill him!

1553
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:34,480
Okay, nice.

1554
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:34,800
Alright.

1555
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,500
I shall feed my peasants.

1556
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:37,260
Don't worry.

1557
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,320
Don't worry, peasants.

1558
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,100
Don't worry.

1559
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,520
I shall make it rain.

1560
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:44,820
Woo!

1561
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:54,870
Oh my gosh!

1562
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:56,330
I'm such a good person.

1563
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:57,270
I'm such a good queen.

1564
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:58,210
I think.

1565
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:00,130
Oh wait, someone got an alloy!

1566
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:01,050
An alloy?

1567
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,130
Somebody got an alloy already!

1568
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:03,810
It's gone.

1569
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:07,370
Oh my god.

1570
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,950
Look at me go, feeding my hungry peasants.

1571
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:13,730
Down with the queen.

1572
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:19,630
Oh my god.

1573
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:22,110
I'm glad people are enjoying it.

1574
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:23,010
Oh my gosh, there's a chicken!

1575
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:25,610
There's a chicken here!

1576
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,270
There was...

1577
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:28,550
There was a chicken.

1578
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:29,290
I heard it.

1579
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:30,130
I heard it die.

1580
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:32,670
There was... Oh!

1581
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:34,350
Faction?

1582
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:36,490
Are you a hermit?

1583
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:37,590
You're living so far!

1584
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:42,450
Hello, your queen is here to welcome you to Doki Land.

1585
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:43,450
Eat!

1586
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:44,710
Eat!

1587
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:48,430
Oh my god, this guy is a hermit.

1588
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:53,730
It's so cool to explore with everybody.

1589
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:57,450
Oh, there's a black sheep here too.

1590
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:59,050
Do they claim the jungle?

1591
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:00,470
Yeah, they live in the jungle.

1592
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:02,390
Those wild peasants.

1593
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:07,150
Barbarian...

1594
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:12,710
Look, they might be a barbarian dragoon, but they're still a dragoon in the end.

1595
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:20,430
I wonder if anybody has claimed land from all the way there.

1596
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:21,090
Oh!

1597
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:23,770
I hear like some of you guys are really far.

1598
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:25,290
I'm gonna... Okay, I'm gonna ask the admin.

1599
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:26,550
I'm gonna... Wait, okay.

1600
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:27,850
Okay.

1601
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:29,810
Admin.

1602
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:32,350
Admin!

1603
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,050
Can you TP me to the far...

1604
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:38,230
far...

1605
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:39,890
far...

1606
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:42,450
claim?

1607
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:44,390
What's the dragon faction area?

1608
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:45,750
Faction area.

1609
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:50,030
I want to see the dragoons from afar.

1610
01:03:53,950 --> 01:04:00,730
I want to see the dragoons that have conquered the land from way far...

1611
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:01,370
What the fuck?

1612
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:03,510
Who claimed this one tiny area?

1613
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:06,770
What land did you claim?

1614
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:10,550
What the fuck kind of land did you claim?

1615
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:13,310
What did you...

1616
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:15,350
What is this house that you have?

1617
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:19,290
The fargoons.

1618
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:21,170
I want to see the fargoons.

1619
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:21,770
Oh my god.

1620
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:25,590
I want to see the fargoons.

1621
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:27,090
The fargoons!

1622
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:31,290
Alright, it's time to TP.

1623
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:32,790
What was it?

1624
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:34,910
I keep always having to remember...

1625
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:35,590
Home...

1626
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:37,290
Home...

1627
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:40,130
Doki Land.

1628
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:42,330
I'm back home.

1629
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:44,450
I'm back in the Doki Lands.

1630
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:46,970
Oh my god, look I got a flower.

1631
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:51,510
Let's see.

1632
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:54,610
Let's put this banner here so you know...

1633
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:56,350
Okay.

1634
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,370
You know we're good people.

1635
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:00,630
Uhhh... yeah.

1636
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,010
The smaller spawns.

1637
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:05,350
The dragoons...

1638
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:06,710
that spawned...

1639
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:10,870
10k blocks away...

1640
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:12,230
from the lobby!

1641
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:19,430
Wait, I want to add...

1642
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:20,890
a note here too.

1643
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,250
Okay,

1644
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,690
give me a sec.

1645
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:27,570
I just had a note.

1646
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:28,870
Uhhh...

1647
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:32,410
Server is only...

1648
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:34,850

1649
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:35,970
dragoons.

1650
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,670
Join the members!

1651
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:40,870
To join the...

1652
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,910
Doki Dragoon SMP!

1653
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:44,290
Hahaha!

1654
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:46,510
Okay.

1655
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:47,270
There we go.

1656
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:50,250
Oh shit, let me make sure it's like...

1657
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:50,710
Boop!

1658
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:53,250
Alright, so people know.

1659
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,490
People will be like...

1660
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:55,710
Well, how do we join?

1661
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:57,950
Now you know.

1662
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:00,410
It's really tiny, but now you know.

1663
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:01,230
Hahaha!

1664
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:03,610
Become... WHOA!

1665
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:04,390
The

1666
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:13,070
queen is here!

1667
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:14,630
Hello!

1668
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:17,230
Chonkygoon!

1669
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:19,910
Hello!

1670
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:21,490
The queen is here!

1671
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:22,950
To say welcome!

1672
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:27,290
The dragoons from the land of far!

1673
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:28,670
Hahaha!

1674
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:28,690
Hahaha!

Hahaha!

The dragoons from the far!

1687
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:55,190
in America.

1688
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:56,030
You know?

1689
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:56,690

You guys won't rebel!

1693
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:04,890
Like America!

1694
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:07,850
You guys are from across the ocean!

1695
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:09,990
Did you guys claim any land?

1696
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:11,070
Oh my god!

1697
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:12,190
Did you guys claim any land?

1698
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:14,130
They look like...

1699
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,190
The Austrians!

1700
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:15,890
Yeah!

1701
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:17,390
These guys are like...

1702
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:19,050
The Americans!

1703
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:21,050

Hahaha!

1708
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:29,090
Hahaha!

01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:31,410

1727
01:07:56,810 --> 01:07:57,670

01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:03,870
Guys, we're back again!

1734
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:04,910
We're back!

1735
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:06,430
Nothing...

1736
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:07,510
I don't know what happened.

1737
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:10,590
My internet was being fucking crazy just then.

1738
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:12,900
Um...

1739
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:14,070
Uh...

1740
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:15,370
Anyway...

1741
01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:16,510
Hahaha!

1742
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:20,810
Alright!

1743
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:21,510
Everybody!

1744
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:25,970
It was... It's great to see the dragoons from afar!

1745
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:27,270
Guys!

1746
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:28,390
I need...

1747
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:29,970
Take me to your land!

1748
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:31,570
Where did you guys set base?

1749
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:33,590
Also, the queen grants you food!

1750
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,310
I am a nice queen!

1751
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:37,130
I am a good queen!

1752
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,570
Anyway, guys...

1753
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:39,750
I need to know...

1754
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:40,910
I need to know, guys.

1755
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:42,130

1756
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:44,310
Show me your land!

1757
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:46,170
I wanna know what you guys built!

1758
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:48,530
Uh... I need to know!

1759
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:50,330
What have you guys built?

1760
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:52,710
What have you guys... Show me where you've claimed your land!

1761
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:55,190
What have you built, guys?

1762
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:56,410
Show...

1763
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:59,310
There is no more embossing say.

1764
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:01,490
Thank you for the aca sopa, Maxwell!

1765
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:02,510
Thank you, thank you!

1766
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:03,850
Alright, I'm gonna follow one person.

1767
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:05,390
Have you built something?

1768
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,130
Do you have something for me to show?

1769
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:08,890
No?

1770
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:11,790
Are you just following me?

1771
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:12,410
Okay... Oh!

1772
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:12,770
This guy!

1773
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:13,790
This guy has something to show!

1774
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:15,070
Do you have something to show?

1775
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:15,850
You do?

1776
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:16,950
Alright.

1777
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:17,990
What do you have?

1778
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:19,190
You don't?

1779
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:20,490
Are you guys all homeless?

1780
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:24,350
You guys had so much time to build some...

1781
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:26,630
America!

1782
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:29,310
What are you guys doing, America?

1783
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:36,300
I left you guys alone!

1784
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,300
And you have nothing to show me?

1785
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,040
Your queen is not happy.

1786
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:48,680
I can't believe it!

1787
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,620
I can't believe you guys are homeless!

1788
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:57,420
I am disappointed.

1789
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,160
The queen is not happy.

1790
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,780
You guys had so much time and you built nothing?

1791
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,020
You guys built nothing?

1792
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,400
There's so much land around you!

1793
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:09,700
Like...

1794
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:13,220
What do you mean you guys built nothing?

1795
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:16,260
What do you mean?

1796
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:19,940
I can't believe it.

1797
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,240
Where's your base?

1798
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,040
You didn't even claim any land!

1799
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,200
Drug American goons!

1800
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,300
You didn't even...

1801
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,540
Germany has land!

1802
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:34,960
Fucking...

1803
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,020
Fucking Germany had land!

1804
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:38,360
Where's your land?

1805
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:42,940
I provided you guys a home.

1806
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,880
We need public housing.

1807
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,020
That's too much to ask for.

1808
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:50,940
Alright, your queen is a little disappointed.

1809
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,340
I'm in a relationship.

1810
01:10:56,380 --> 01:11:00,080
I'm a little disappointed in you guys.

1811
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,200
I'm a little disappointed in you guys.

1812
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:01,280
I'm a little disappointed in you guys.

1813
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:06,500
Guys, the Dragoons from Dokiland have already built so much.

1814
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:12,340
America, I left you guys alone for like an hour!

1815
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:12,700
for like an hour!

1816
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:15,180
And there's no mega house yet?

1817
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,700
And there's no mega house yet?

1818
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:22,120
I don't understand.

1819
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,060
That's the old word.

1820
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,300
Not even a dirt house!

1821
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:29,540
There's no land claim anywhere!

1822
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,440
There's no...

1823
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:35,840
I'm just saying.

1824
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:36,900
I'm just saying.

1825
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,520
The goons back in Dokiland...

1826
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:49,680
The goons back in Dokiland, they've already built so... they've already claimed everything around Dokiland.

1827
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,720
But like, oh my god.

1828
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,600
I said you guys away to the new world.

1829
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,200
I said you guys away to the new world!

1830
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,440
And you guys didn't have anything to show for me?

1831
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,500
How would you pay for the taxes?

1832
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,640
How would you pay for the taxes in the new world?

1833
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,320
Alright, I'm going back.

1834
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,700
Goodbye American Dragoons.

1835
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,840
Goodbye new world Dragoons!

1836
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,500
You've disappointed your queen!

1837
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,480
Goodbye!

1838
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,320
Goodbye!

1839
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,280
I forgot the commands for this again.

1840
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:27,660
There we go.

1841
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:29,740
Back to Dokiland we go.

1842
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:31,580
Hello.

1843
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:34,460
Have you guys given your taxes back?

1844
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:43,860
Look at these civilized goons that have built stuff around Dokiland!

1845
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,220
Look at that!

1846
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,440
This goon has a house foundation already set up!

1847
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:49,480
Look at that!

1848
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:49,500
This goon has a house foundation already set up!

1849
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:50,640
Look at that!

1850
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:53,240
I see big houses in front of me!

1851
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,840
The new world goons knows what's up.

1852
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:00,280
I mean sorry the old world goons knows what's up.

1853
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:07,720
No taxes without representation.

1854

Thank you Miracle for the super chat.

1855
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:11,340
Thank you.

Thank you.

1857
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:18,040
All I'm saying is the old world Dragoons know what to do.

1858
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:18,740

01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:21,920
It's a shitty home!

1861
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,800
But it's a home alright!

01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,420
Like look at these guys!

1865
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:37,180
They know what they're doing!

1866
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:38,880
It's not stealing!

1867
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:39,940
It's taxes!

1868
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:43,500
It's not stealing!

1869
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,180
It's just taxes!

1870
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:47,620
It's just taxes!

1871
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,240
It's really nice to pay a visit.

1872
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:50,680
Umm...

1873
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:54,120
Umm... Just stole Lithuania's iron?

1874
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:55,660
Yeah, tell that to the British.

1875
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:03,700
The queen requires...

1876
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:05,780
The queen requires...

1877
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:06,600
The queen requires...

1878
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:06,880
Oh wait!

1879
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,480
Is that a bird?

1880
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:11,000
Oh my god!

1881
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:11,900
Is that your bird?

1882
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,680
Oh it's your bird!

1883
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,440
Oh that's so cute!

1884
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,580
Oh you can't make it dance yet though.

1885
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,240
It's different.

1886
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:21,660
It's different!

1887
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:28,540
Alright, I wanna see if anyone Alright, I wanna see if anyone already built a dock yet.

1888
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,800
Umm... It's fun!

1889
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,720
I'm so glad you guys can play on the server with me.

1890
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:37,160
I can't wait to do more... What the fuck is this?

1891
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,680
What the fuck is that?

1892
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,980
What is that?

1893
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:43,120
Port eggs.

1894
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,060
Ha ha ha!

1895
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,300
Eggtown and port eggs.

1896
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,120
Alright.

1897
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:49,460
Let's see.

1898
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:49,900
Oh my god!

1899
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:50,540
That's my dock!

1900
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:53,420
Coyote.

1901
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,300
I like how people have already built...

1902
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,280
Doki Land 2!

1903
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,780
Where I stole from Miku.

1904
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:00,080
Ha ha ha!

1905
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:02,160
What is this?

1906
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:06,520
The Chonky Goons have something else to say about that.

1907
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:07,780
Uh...

1908
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,020
Long Goons have claimed this dock.

1909
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:11,660
Wait, what?

1910
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,120
Ha ha!

1911
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,820
This is a dock for everybody!

1912
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,340
Oh, are you guys actually making a ship dock?

1913
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:18,920
What is this?

1914
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,420
Portatep made...

1915
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:21,900
Ha ha ha!

1916
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:24,680
Ha ha ha!

1917
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,120
Portatep made a dock!

1918
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,480
Oh my god!

1919
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:31,460
That's funny!

1920
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,000
What does this say?

1921
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:36,660
What the fuck is that?

1922
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,620
I can't... They're trying to make a word.

1923
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:41,960
I don't even know what word they're trying...

1924
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:42,740
Oh, dock!

1925
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:43,800
Ha ha ha!

1926
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,060
Is that... What's that word?

1927
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,340
D... O...

1928
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:49,220
Uh...

1929
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:50,140
Ha ha ha!

1930
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,640
Oh, is it Doki?

1931
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:53,060
Oh, it's Doki!

1932
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:54,680
Oh!

1933
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:56,700
That's so cool!

1934
01:15:59,260 --> 01:15:59,780
Somebody...

1935
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:02,600
Poor guy who was trying to make a dock and it got claimed.

1936
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,740
Doki can't read.

1937
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:06,380
You guys already know that I can't read!

1938
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,960
Like, it's not new at all!

1939
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,180
Sorry, I'm not actually playing Minecraft.

1940
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:11,980
I'm just exploring.

1941
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:12,680
It's fun!

1942
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,540
It's fun seeing what you guys are doing right now.

1943
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:17,640
Is it... Ha ha ha!

1944
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,540
I am James of the Iris.

1945
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:23,260
I own a village now known as Legoland, which is at spawn.

1946
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,400
You owe me one diamond for that one!

1947
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:27,000
Take it illegally!

1948
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:29,620
Who said that?

1949
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:30,240
James?

1950
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:31,280
This is your town?

1951
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,640
Thank you for the super chat!

1952
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:33,060
Thank you!

1953
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,920
This is your town?

1954
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,360
Don't make me kill this villager right now, James.

1955
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,080
Nobody governs!

1956
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:41,880
Queen Doki!

1957
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,400
Ha ha ha ha!

1958
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,040
Do you...

1959
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:48,600
I can make...

1960
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,980
I can make a... I can get flint right now.

1961
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:53,700
Ha ha ha ha!

1962
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:54,740
Ha ha ha ha!

1963
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:01,900
I can... I can get flint right now and there will be no village.

1964
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,400
Ha ha ha ha!

1965
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:04,540
Ha ha ha ha!

1966
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:06,260
You won't want that, James!

1967
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:07,960
Ha ha ha ha!

1968
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:08,960
Oh my god!

1969
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,200
Wait, somebody's already kidnapping your villager!

1970
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:12,520
Ha ha ha!

1971
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,220
James, your villager's getting kidnapped!

1972
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,540
Oh my god!

1973
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:20,700
They're kidnapping your villager!

1974
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,600
They're... Ha ha ha!

1975
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,240
James!

1976
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,440
You kidnapped your villager, James!

1977
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:27,380
Ha ha ha ha!

1978
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,360
Ha ha ha ha!

1979
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:29,460
Ha ha ha ha!

1980
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,240
Ha ha ha!

1981
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,400
James, you're not doing so well!

1982
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:34,380
I like...

1983
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:35,380
Ha ha ha ha!

1984
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,040
Ha ha ha!

1985
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,300
You already took your villager away!

1986
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,160
What is this guy trying to write?

1987
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,460
What is this... Ha ha ha!

1988
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,680
What is this guy trying to write?

1989
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:44,680
What is this guy?

1990
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:45,600
It's called...

1991
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,240
Oh my god!

1992
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,780
He's rowing away!

1993
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:50,360
Very slowly.

1994
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:51,940
Ha ha ha!

1995
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,280
Ha ha ha!

1996
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:59,720
They're gonna escape in three or four business days!

1997
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:01,260
Hurry, James!

1998
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:03,680
Oh hey, look, everybody's here!

1999
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,160
Welcome to the lobby!

2000
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,280
Welcome, everybody!

2001
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:10,300
Are you guys having a good time?

2002
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:12,560
Welcome!

2003
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,200
This is the lobby area.

2004
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:16,540
We're gonna upgrade this more later on.

2005
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:17,600
Ha ha ha!

2006
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,580
It's an arranged marriage.

2007
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:24,220
We watched the kidnapping live on stream.

2008
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,280
Oh my gosh.

2009
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:29,640
It's been pretty fun so far.

2010
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:30,400
Ooh!

2011
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:32,500
Should we kill the ender dragon right now?

2012
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,720
Guys, let's do it.

2013
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,020
Should we do it?

2014
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,860
It'd be so fun.

2015
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:42,020
We all just like went to the ender...

2016
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:44,380
Enderworld and then killed it in like...

2017
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:47,020
I'm pretty sure somebody has already killed the ender dragon.

2018
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:47,700
Like...

2019
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,080
Oh my god!

2020
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,420
Is this all your land?

2021
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,560
Is this all your land?

2022
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:55,980
That's fucking insane.

2023
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,220
That's a lot of land.

2024
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,280
The last time, like, the...

2025
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:06,100
The Minecraft dragoons that broke into the server because our whitelist fucked up.

2026
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:08,060
They like...

2027
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,940
They killed the ender dragon in like two hours.

2028
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,820
So I won't be surprised if they're almost there.

2029
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:17,580
Alright!

2030
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:22,140
Let's go kill the... We need public housing projects for the new world.

2031
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:27,880
One of you guys better build it.

2032
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,320
You think I'm gonna build it?

2033
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:29,940
Like...

2034
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:37,480
You think... You think I'm gonna build public housing?

2035
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,200
That's...

2036
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:38,820
Oh my god!

2037
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:40,920
There's your chickens!

2038
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:44,880
What if they follow me?

2039
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:55,380
What if they follow me?

2040
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:55,680
What about me?

2041
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,960
What about me?

2042
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,240
I'm not a bad person.

2043
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,780
I'm not a bad person.

2044
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:07,200
I'm not a bad person.

2045
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:07,680
It's okay.

2046
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,460
Go lead your chicken over here.

2047

01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:19,860
Oh my god, I have more food.

01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,320
I have more food.

2054
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:25,540
Alright.

2055
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:26,760
Alright, guys.

2056
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:31,480
Whoever wants to beat the ender dragon, go to the lobby.

01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:38,300
For those who are 10,000 blocks away, I'm sorry new world goons, but like, we'll meet you in the ender world.

2058
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:39,000

01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:44,460

01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:47,240
The new world goons will meet you in the ender...

2061
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,140
The ender world.

2062
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:51,960
For now.

2063
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:54,400
Everybody at the old world.

2064
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,580
The old world.

2065
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,280
Come to the lobby.

Even know where the portal is?

2067
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:04,380
Somebody has to know where the portal is.

2068
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:06,840
Um...

2069
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:07,500
Alright, guys.

2070
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:08,320
Everybody!

2071
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:08,980
Go to the lobby.

2072
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,180
Alright, let's wait until they sleep.

2073
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:12,440
When they sleep.

2074
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:13,140
Alright, guys.

2075
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:13,680
You guys ready?

01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,000
You guys ready to kill the ender dragon?

2077
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,060

01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:20,980
Yeah!

2079
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,140
Alright, who knows where the ender dragon is?

2080
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:23,920
Guys.

2081
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,840
Guys, who knows?

2082
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:30,320
If you know where the ender dragon is...

2083
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:30,940
Uh...

2084
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:31,640

Come here.

2088
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:40,000
If you know where the ender dragon is...

2089
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,080
I require...

2090
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:41,720

2092
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:45,880
Uh...

01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:50,720

2094
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:51,260
If you are one of the...

2095
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:51,660
One of the...

2096
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:54,300
I know where the ender dragon is.

2097
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:56,840
I need a PP tower so I know which one knows.

2098
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:00,780
Give me a PP tower.

2099
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:02,160
So I know you guys...

2100
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,540
You know where the ender dragon is.

2101
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:07,760
Somebody must have figured it out by now.

2102
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:13,580
Did anybody figured it out?

2103
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,020
Are none of the speedrunners in this...

2104
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:16,820
In this area?

2105
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,160
Are they in the new world?

2106
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,640
Oh, the speedrunners are all in the new world.

2107
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:21,200
Goddamn.

2108
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:24,740
Goddamn it, we sent the wrong...

2109
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,040
Oh my god.

2110
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,560
Did we send the wrong...

2111
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,280
...dragoons?

2112
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:34,860
No one knows.

2113
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:36,440
Alright.

2114
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:43,270
Does anybody know where the fucking ender...

2115
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:45,210
Is there no PP tower anywhere?

2116
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:48,090
I'm stuck with the old world.

2117
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:49,870
Dragoons!

2118
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:55,210
Is there no dragoon with a PP tower that knows where the ender dragon is?

2119
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:55,910
Is there no dragoon with a PP tower that knows where the ender dragon is?

2120
01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:56,010
Is there no dragoon with a PP tower that knows where the ender dragon is?

2121
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:56,370
Oh wait.

2122
01:22:56,590 --> 01:22:57,150
Okay, wait.

2123
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:58,710
Oh, this one!

2124
01:23:00,170 --> 01:23:01,090
These guys!

2125
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:02,550
Alright, who do we trust?

2126
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:03,950
We have two dragoons.

2127
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:05,270
Okay, we have this one.

2128
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:06,590
What's his name?

2129
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:08,890
What's your name, sir?

2130
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:10,850
We have an egg goon?

2131
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:13,310
What's his name?

2132
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:15,630
What's your name, sir?

2133
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:17,310
Alright.

2134
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:18,590
L for demon.

2135
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:20,530
And then we have...

2136
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:22,730
We have Tommy.

2137
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:25,730
Alright, it's Tommy versus L.

2138
01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:27,350
Alright, guys.

2139
01:23:28,190 --> 01:23:29,350
We're gonna have a poll.

2140
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:30,750
We're gonna have a poll.

2141
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:31,150
His poll...

2142
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:34,690
His PP is bigger.

2143
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:36,470
Alright, actually...

2144
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:41,110
Whoever has the biggest PP tower will lead us to the ender dragon.

2145
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:52,090
Whoever makes the biggest PP tower gets to lead us to the ender dragon.

2146
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:56,590
And then Tommy has iron so I trust him.

2147
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:58,910
Well, you better hurry.

2148
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:09,090
Only the biggest PP tower can lead the... Okay, he took made it.

2149
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:13,630
Is that really the biggest you have?

2150
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:15,970
Is that really it?

2151
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:20,290
Okay, well, we definitely know who's the winner here.

2152
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:21,070
This guy stopped.

2153
01:24:21,650 --> 01:24:23,470
He stopped building.

2154
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:24,410
Hahaha!

2155
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:31,100
Wow!

2156
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:33,360
Alright.

2157
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:36,940
Tom- Tommy's gonna win, I think.

2158
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:39,220
Tommy's gonna win.

2159
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,200
Alright, Tommy!

2160
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:41,860
That's okay!

2161
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:43,540
You can stop now, Tommy!

2162
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,720
He can stop now.

2163
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,980
Tommy, we will follow you to the ender dragon!

2164
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,000
Somebody light the bottom on fire.

2165
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:54,160
That'd be so funny.

2166
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,580
Is anyone at flint?

2167
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:11,940
It's okay, Tommy lived!

2168
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,500
He lived!

2169
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:14,040
Tommy!

2170
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:16,860
Wait, where did Tommy go?

2171
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:17,740
He lived, guys!

2172
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,940
Tommy actually lived!

2173
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:22,440
Alright, Tommy!

2174
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,240
Where did Tommy go?

2175
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:25,780
Where did he go?

2176
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:28,320
Tommy, lead us!

2177
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,720
To the Ender Dragon, wherever you are!

2178
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:33,320
Yeah, he lived!

2179
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:34,360
I saw him!

2180
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,600
The other guy died.

2181
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:36,960
But I saw Tommy live.

2182
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:39,360
Alright.

2183
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:41,940
Is that Tommy?

2184
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,360
Is Tommy trying to lead us right here?

2185
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:46,540
Oh my god, Tommy!

2186
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:48,120
Tommy, where are you?

2187
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:51,080
There's so many people, Tommy!

2188
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:51,840
Hahaha!

2189
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:52,480
Hahaha!

2190
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,720
Wait, did he actually die?

2191
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:57,260
Oh shit!

2192
01:25:57,940 --> 01:25:59,280
Wait, who's gonna lead us?

2193
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:01,940
Oh, well, if Tommy died, we have a new leader now.

2194
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:03,100
This guy!

2195
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:05,260
This guy!

2196
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:06,360
Hahaha!

2197
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:10,420
Whoever you are, you shall lead us!

2198
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,060
To the Ender Dragon!

2199
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:13,500
Hahaha!

2200
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:16,940
Hahaha!

2201
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,500
Take us to the Ender Dragon!

2202
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:21,100
Hahaha!

2203
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:22,940
Look!

2204
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:23,700
Hahaha!

2205
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,120
Alright!

2206
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:27,160
Alright, he's dead too.

2207
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:28,080
Okay.

2208
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,880
Alright, you there!

2209
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:31,020
Cosmic!

2210
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:32,120
By...

2211
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:33,880
By...

2212
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:35,980
Elimination!

2213
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:37,420
Hahaha!

2214
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:41,040
You get to be the leader, Cosmic!

2215
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:42,480
Take us to the Ender Dragon!

2216
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,220
Hahaha!

2217
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,580
We're gonna follow you!

2218
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:48,060
Cosmic, we're all ready!

2219
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:49,240
Where is it?

2220
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:51,040
Oh, Cosmic, he doesn't know!

2221
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:53,280
He didn't even know!

2222
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,860
We don't have actual leaders!

2223
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:56,800
He doesn't even know!

2224
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,980
He's like, wait, I was just joking!

2225
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:00,340
Hahaha!

2226
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,380
Cosmic was just joking!

2227
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:05,880
What happened?

2228
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:06,660
Oh, this guy!

2229
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:07,300
Right here!

2230
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:08,420
He's on his own pee-pee!

2231
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:10,520
Alright!

2232
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:11,640
You there!

2233
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:13,400
You've done it!

2234
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:14,740
You are now the leader!

2235
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:16,340
To take us to the Ender Dragon!

2236
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,760
All the other ones died!

2237
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,820
So, congratulations!

2238
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:23,180
Hahaha!

2239
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:23,580
Hahaha!

2240
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:25,640
Congratulations!

2241
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,520
You there!

2242
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,760
All the other leaders!

2243
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,180
Ender Dragon leaders died!

2244
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:31,800
Oh!

2245
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:33,980
Hahaha!

2246
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:38,480
Cos I don't think we're gonna be led!

2247
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:39,120
Hahaha!

2248
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:40,360
Hahaha!

2249
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:43,320
Hahaha!

2250
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,120
Guys, I think this position is cursed!

2251
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:52,080
Guys, I think this position...

2252
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,680
Other than Cosmic who was...

2253
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,880
Who did not have the credentials...

2254
01:27:55,880 --> 01:28:00,860
Cosmic had no credentials to be a leader and was lying this entire time!

2255
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,860
We don't have anybody to lead us, guys!

2256
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:09,800
Everybody who has a pee-pee tower has so far, like, failed us!

2257
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,280
Oh my gosh!

2258
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:11,540
Whoops!

2259
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:12,200
Hahaha!

2260
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:12,460
Hahaha!

2261
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:12,560
Hahaha!

2262
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:14,380
You there!

2263
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:15,380
You!

2264
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:17,960
Do you know where the Ender Dragon is?

2265
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:18,780
Come down!

2266
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:19,840
You're the new leader now!

2267
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,040
This time it'll work!

2268
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:22,840
Come down!

2269
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:24,420
Hahaha!

2270
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:26,960
Don't build it any taller!

2271
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:29,720
We've seen what happened!

2272
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,080
Hahaha!

2273
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:33,820
Come down!

2274
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,900
We need you to lead us!

2275
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:39,900
You must know where the Ender Dragon is!

2276
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:40,620
You must know where the Ender Dragon is!

2277
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:42,320
Come down, but not too fast!

2278
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,240
Hahaha!

2279
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:47,020
Okay, this is...

2280
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,560
Alright, you're the closest.

2281
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,720
Okay, you're the closest to the ground.

2282
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,740
Yamabro, alright, now you're the leader.

2283
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,880
Yamabro, alright, you're the leader now.

2284
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:56,860
Hahaha!

2285
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:58,280
Hahaha!

2286
01:28:58,620 --> 01:28:59,720
Alright, Yamabro!

2287
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,640
Take us to the Ender!

2288
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,820
Oh, it's right underneath us?

2289
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,340
Guys, it's right underneath us!

2290
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,000
Go!

2291
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:10,080
If we all dig together, we can get to the...

2292
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:10,860
We can get underneath!

2293
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,320
Alright!

2294
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,800
Guys, that's our leader!

2295
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:17,000
Guys, that's our leader!

2296
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:19,320
That's our leader!

2297
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:19,860
Keep digging!

2298
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:22,200
Keep digging!

2299
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:23,900
We need to dig!

2300
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:25,780
Dig down right now, everybody!

2301
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:26,680
Dig down!

2302
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,320
That's where the Ender Dragon is!

2303
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:30,040
Dig down!

2304
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:32,180
The Ender Dragon is right below!

2305
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:34,800
Dig straight down!

2306
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:36,060
Hahaha!

2307
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:39,220
Hahaha!

2308
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:39,760
Hahaha!

2309
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:42,220
That's where it is!

2310
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:43,640
Hahaha!

2311
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:59,960
I swear, I swear, if the New World Dragoons have made it to the Ender without us, I swear to God, guys, I swear to God, if the New World Dragoons have made it before us...

2312
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:00,500
Hahaha!

2313
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:04,440
Oh my God, there's water here.

2314
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:05,800
Guys, I don't...

2315
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,060
Guys, what do we do?

2316
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,660
What do we do?

2317
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:09,220
This is...

2318
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,540
Guys, I don't think we planned this very well.

2319
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:14,920
I don't think we planned this very well.

2320
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:15,560
Hahaha!

2321
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:19,800
Yammer Bro!

2322
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,160
Where's the Ender?

2323
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:23,100
Where is it?

2324
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,660
Oh, it's me.

2325
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:27,560
Okay, I'm fine.

2326
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:28,540
I'm well...

2327
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:29,320
Hahaha!

2328
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:31,880
Where is it?

2329
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:33,320
Oh my God!

2330
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:34,820
The guy with lava!

2331
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:36,120
Oh shit!

2332
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:38,880
Are we going... What the fuck?

2333
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,920
Okay, I guess we're going to the End.

2334
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:45,660
Okay, I guess we're going to the End.

2335
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:46,500
Alright, we did it.

2336
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:49,520
Now what?

2337
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:51,980
Now what do we do?

2338
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:55,120
Now what?

2339
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:55,700
Alright, guys.

2340
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:57,480
You know...

2341
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,300
Yammer Bro knows what they're doing!

2342
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,580
Oh, sorry, the Nether!

2343
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:02,940
We're going to the Nether!

2344
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:07,780
Guys, Queen has like had to do a lot of stuff today, okay?

2345
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:08,260
Hahaha!

2346
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:10,640
Hahaha!

2347
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:13,280
The Queen has been through a lot.

2348
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:13,960
Hahaha!

2349
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:17,400
Oh no!

2350
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,480
Guys, I can't move up!

2351
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:21,500
Wooo!

2352
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:23,480
Somebody will take this!

2353
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:24,760
Guys!

2354
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:25,720
Guys!

2355
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:27,600

Oh, okay, nice, okay.

Alright, where do we go?

2360
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:34,100
This way?

2361
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:35,780
Alright.

2362
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:37,760
Guys, we can't let the new world go!

2363
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:40,760
The new world goons beat us to it, guys!

2364
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:42,680
Guys!

2365
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:43,100
Guys!

2366
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:46,000
We can't let the new world dragoons beat us!

2367
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:47,900
Can't let America win!

2368
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:49,360
Hahaha!

2369
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:52,540
Hahaha!

2370
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:54,200
Hahaha!

2371
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:57,600
We can't let them win!

2372
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,820
We're the old world dragoons!

2373
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:01,100
Hahaha!

2374
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:05,680
Hahaha!

2375
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:06,180
Hahaha!

2376
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:06,380
Hahaha!

2377
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:10,160
Where did Yamabro go?

2378
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:12,800
Where did Yamabro go?

2379
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:14,060
Where did Yamabro go?

2380
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:15,540
Where did he go?

2381
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:19,720
Over here!

2382
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:20,700
Down here!

2383
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,000
Okay, follow the pathway!

2384
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:23,600
You'll be pussies!

2385
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:25,220
Yeah!

2386
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,420
Oh my god, that was half HP.

2387
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:28,640
Okay, maybe a little pussy.

2388
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:31,620
Alright, this way guys!

2389
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:32,180
This way!

2390
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:35,580
This way guys!

2391
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:39,380
We can't let them beat the ender dragon!

2392
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:40,920
Hahaha!

2393
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:42,720
Wooo!

2394
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:45,400
What happened?

2395
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:48,420
What happened?

2396
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:48,980
There's so...

2397
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:49,880
What did that?

2398
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,740
Who fucking put a bed down?

2399
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:55,290
Hahaha!

2400
01:32:57,090 --> 01:32:59,350
Who put a bed down?

2401
01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:00,850
Hahaha!

2402
01:33:01,730 --> 01:33:03,010
What the fuck?

2403
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:03,410
Wooo!

2404
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:03,730
Oh!

2405
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:05,790
Oh god!

2406
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:07,910
Oh god!

2407
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:12,790
Where are we?

2408
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:14,350
Oh!

2409
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:20,200
Did they do it?

2410
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,100
What the fuck was it?

2411
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:23,400
The new world dragoons?

2412
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:30,610
Oh shit!

2413
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:33,770
Did they do it?

2414
01:33:35,170 --> 01:33:36,930
Someone made it to the end?

2415
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:38,570
Where is it?

2416
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:42,210
We lost Yammer bro!

2417
01:33:42,410 --> 01:33:43,250
Where's Yammer?

2418
01:33:43,430 --> 01:33:43,850
Hahaha!

2419
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:44,850
Hahaha!

2420
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:49,710
How the fuck?

2421
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:50,750
How did they do it?

2422
01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:51,590
Guys!

2423
01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:52,570
How did we win?

2424
01:33:52,910 --> 01:33:54,250
Oh wait, they opened the portal.

2425
01:33:54,330 --> 01:33:55,690
Guys, they haven't done it yet guys!

2426
01:33:56,210 --> 01:33:58,050
They've only opened the portal.

2427
01:33:58,110 --> 01:33:58,890
Who are we following?

2428
01:33:59,430 --> 01:34:00,690
Who are we following?

2429
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:01,910
Hahaha!

2430
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:07,490
We lost Yammer bro!

2431
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:08,430
Hahaha!

2432
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:10,920
Hahaha!

2433
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:14,400
Guys, we lost the leader!

2434
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:16,080
Guys!

2435
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:18,000
Hahaha!

2436
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:18,560
Hahaha!

2437
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,160
We've lost the leader!

2438
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,560
Guys, where did he go?

2439
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:25,780
Oh wait, I got TP.

2440
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:26,340
You're right.

2441
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:27,220
Haha!

2442
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:30,240
Guys, TP to...

2443
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:31,680
Yammer.

2444
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,460
Goodbye guys.

2445
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:35,400
Sorry, I messed it up.

2446
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:38,080
TP Yammer bro.

2447
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:41,180
I TP'd you here.

2448
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:42,220
Now lead us.

2449
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:43,040
Hahaha!

2450
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:44,580
Oops, I re-fret.

2451
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:47,380
Oh my god.

2452
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:49,160
Now lead us.

2453
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:50,260
Guys!

2454
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:51,320
Guys!

2455
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:54,360
You know where... You do know where we're going, right?

2456
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:57,480
You know where it is, right?

2457
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:01,800
You actually... Hahaha!

2458
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:03,680
Hahaha!

2459
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:04,100
Hahaha!

2460
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:06,120
Yammer bro!

2461
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,260
We... Haha!

2462
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:10,000
Guys, they're not gonna defeat the...

2463
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:12,340
They're not gonna defeat the ender dragon without us!

2464
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:12,580
Guys!

2465
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:13,520
Okay?

2466
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,320
They're not gonna do it!

2467
01:35:15,930 --> 01:35:16,420
Wait, what?

2468
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:19,280
What?

2469
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:20,480
Hahaha!

2470
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:24,380
Where is... Where are they taking us?

2471
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:24,980
Hahaha!

2472
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:28,040
It's okay, don't mind him!

2473
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:29,800
We have an army!

2474
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:33,420
I swear to god, if he's like...

2475
01:35:33,930 --> 01:35:36,220
All the other competent leaders die.

2476
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:36,940
Hahaha!

2477
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:37,020
Hahaha!

2478
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:39,780
Hahaha!

2479
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:44,900
All our other competent leaders have died.

2480
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:46,840
All we have is Yammer bro.

2481
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:47,700
Hahaha!

2482
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:48,720
Hahaha!

2483
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,640
They built the PP Tower!

2484
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:57,060
It was the shortest PP Tower ever built.

2485
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:58,920
But they still built it!

2486
01:35:59,100 --> 01:35:59,580
Like...

2487
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:01,560
It still happened!

2488
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,240
Okay, I'm not standing near the edge of this.

2489
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:07,160
Hahaha!

2490
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:10,740
Oh!

2491
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:11,420
Oh!

2492
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:11,580
Whoa!

2493
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:11,780
Whoa!

2494
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:12,000
Whoa!

2495
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:13,120
Okay.

2496
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:14,900
Alright.

2497
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:16,440
Give me a sec.

2498
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:17,080
I need a...

2499
01:36:17,820 --> 01:36:18,640
I fucked up.

2500
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:19,640
Alright, there we go.

2501
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:20,620
Alright.

2502
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:20,900
Whoa!

2503
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:22,220
Okay, that was close.

2504
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:25,520
Does he... Does he know where he's going?

2505
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:27,280
Look!

2506
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:28,980
All the other leaders died!

2507
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:30,720
This is all we have now!

2508
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:32,340
We compromised!

2509
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:34,440
We compromised!

2510
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:35,640
Hahaha!

2511
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:36,880
Hahaha!

2512
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:40,860
We had to compromise!

2513
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:41,820
Okay?

2514
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,600
All the other ones died!

2515
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:46,020
Hahaha!

2516
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:48,700
Hahaha!

2517
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:48,880
Hahaha!

2518
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:51,020
Alright.

2519
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:52,740
I think he knows what he's doing.

2520
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:55,540
Guys, I think he knows what...

2521
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:57,440
Guys, he knows what he's doing, guys.

2522
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:00,620
Like...

2523
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:03,140
Look, he has a set up pathway.

2524
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,680
So, like, surely, right?

2525
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:10,200
Guys, I fell.

2526
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:11,940
Where did he go?

2527
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:13,600
What did... Oh, there he is!

2528
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,100
Where is he taking us?

2529
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:20,920
Guys, where is he taking...

2530
01:37:21,740 --> 01:37:23,820
Where is he taking us?

2531
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:24,720
Please!

2532
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:26,600
The new world dragons!

2533
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:28,300
Please!

2534
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:31,660
We didn't get there before the new world dragons!

2535
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:33,000
Hahaha!

2536
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:37,440
We can't let the American goons win!

2537
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:39,940
Please!

2538
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:43,560
I called them uncivilized!

2539
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:44,920
Hahaha!

2540
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:49,980
They're gonna try and do a revolution if they find out!

2541
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:50,920
Hahaha!

2542
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:55,920
If they beat the end before the rest of us, they're gonna...

2543
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:56,740
Hahaha!

2544
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:01,440
They're gonna try and succeed from Doki Land!

2545
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:02,560
Hahaha!

2546
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:02,940
The...

2547
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,680
The longest fight!

2548
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:05,580
Hahaha!

2549
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:10,340
Guys, it was unlucky that, like, the other...

2550
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:17,340
the diamond dragoons in the old world died from the PP tower that they made.

2551
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:18,500
Oh!

2552
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:19,700
Shit!

2553
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:20,900
Don't go up!

2554
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:22,100
Don't!

2555
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:22,480
Hahaha!

2556
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:23,260
He

2557
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:29,040
dug the lava!

2558
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:31,820
He dug the...

2559
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:33,820
Okay, it's time to TP again.

2560
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:34,980
Hahaha!

2561
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:36,160
Hahaha!

2562
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:38,520
Yeah...

2563
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:39,680
What was it?

2564
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:42,540
Doki...

2565
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:45,880
Wait, how do you TP with me to the other person?

2566
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:46,840
Like...

2567
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:48,340
How do I...

2568
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,560
No, that wasn't Yam bro!

2569
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:51,500
How...

2570
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,520
How do you do the TP to a person?

2571
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:57,480
How do you...

2572
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:59,580
TPA... Oh, TPA...

2573
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:01,720
Yam bro...

2574
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:03,460
Am I there?

2575
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:04,560
Wait, where did...

2576
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,000
Wait, did he die?

2577
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:08,360
Oh!

2578
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:10,080
Oh!

2579
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:11,500
Where is it?

2580
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:12,700
Where is it?

2581
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:12,780
Yeah!

2582
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:13,220
Haha!

2583
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:14,860
It's just you and...

2584
01:39:15,530 --> 01:39:16,780
three people!

2585
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:18,000
Only three!

2586
01:39:18,340 --> 01:39:20,360
There's only three!

2587
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:21,320
Hahaha!

2588
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:22,380
Hahaha!

2589
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,420
Oh my god!

2590
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:30,120
Wait, did I do TP?

2591
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:30,600
Aww!

2592
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:32,600
Aww!

2593
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,020
Guys, we did it!

2594
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:40,480
Guys!

2595
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:41,820
Guys, I...

2596
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:45,200
Guys, I...

2597
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,300
Guys, I fucked up a little.

2598
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:48,000
Hahaha!

2599
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,080
I fucked up a little!

2600
01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:51,360
Hahaha!

2601
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:52,520
It's okay guys!

2602
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:53,400
It's okay!

2603
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:54,060
We're...

2604
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:57,240
We're all here for the journey!

2605
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:58,300
Hahaha!

2606
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,300
Alright, where do we go?

2607
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,820
Where did you take us?

2608
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:03,260
How am I gonna go home?

2609
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:05,380
How do I get home?

2610
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:07,080
How do I get home?

2611
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:10,910
What do we do now?

2612
01:40:12,510 --> 01:40:14,670
This has been a terrible expedition!

2613
01:40:15,070 --> 01:40:15,910
This has been a terrible expedition!

2614
01:40:17,830 --> 01:40:18,550
Hahaha!

I don't think you actually knew where it is!

2621
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:35,190
I don't... I don't think...

2622
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:37,870
Yeah bro!

2629
01:40:54,490 --> 01:40:55,970
This is where we came from?

01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:01,470
This is where we came from?

01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:02,270

01:41:05,790 --> 01:41:06,190

01:42:52,650 --> 01:42:53,630
He's walking back!

2696
01:42:53,930 --> 01:42:55,350
We're back in Germany now!

2697
01:42:56,730 --> 01:42:58,150
And now we left Germany.

2698
01:42:58,390 --> 01:42:58,710
Okay!

01:43:30,850 --> 01:43:31,570
Hahaha!

2714
01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:33,350

He's got... He knows what he's doing!

2728
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:55,590
Guys!

2729
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:56,930
You guys are doubting him!

2730
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:58,210
But he knows what he's doing!

2731
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:01,670

He clearly knows what he's doing guys!

2734
01:44:07,110 --> 01:44:09,350
He might have taken us in the circle!

2735
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:10,390
Like...

2736
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:13,410
During... During the Nether!

2737
01:44:14,590 --> 01:44:15,470
But it's okay!

2739
01:44:19,490 --> 01:44:20,730
He has a goal!

Alright!

01:44:22,730 --> 01:44:23,930
He remembered not to do that!

2743
01:44:23,970 --> 01:44:26,550
He clearly has a goal somewhere!

2744
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:28,450
He has... Somewhere!

2745
01:44:28,590 --> 01:44:28,910

01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:35,650
Where are you headed?

2751
01:44:36,230 --> 01:44:38,230

2752
01:44:43,990 --> 01:44:45,190
The new world!

2753
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:46,170
Always the new world!

2754
01:44:46,230 --> 01:44:47,770

01:45:03,610 --> 01:45:05,110
The new world has to wait!

2764
01:45:05,210 --> 01:45:05,830

Where the fuck are you going?

2767
01:45:10,010 --> 01:45:11,930
Why do you need a tree?

2768
01:45:13,090 --> 01:45:13,690

01:45:31,210 --> 01:45:31,570
I'm sorry.

2778
01:45:31,630 --> 01:45:33,010
I didn't trust this plan less and less.

2779
01:45:33,010 --> 01:45:33,610
Wait!

2780
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:35,170

2785
01:45:39,130 --> 01:45:40,410
To the end.

Bro the new world has been at the end for like 20 years now!

2790
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:54,380

01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:21,500

Alright guys.

Who knows where the end is?

2800
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:28,400
Whoever has the biggest PP tower gets to take us to the new world.

2801
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:29,500
Not new world.

2802
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:32,700
Gets to take us to the end and beat the new worlders.

2803
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:33,840
But then...

2804
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:34,720
Everybody died.

2805
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:37,720
He was literally like the last person left alive.

2806
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:40,240
I could not do anything else.

2807
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:41,420
He was literally the last one.

2808
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:43,040
Alright where is it?

2809
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:45,060
I don't know.

2810
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:48,720
I didn't decide to follow him!

2811
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:50,300
We had no other choice left!

2812
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:52,680
All our other picks died!

2813
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:53,940
From mysterious circumstances!

2814
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:57,300
They all died mysteriously!

2815
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,820
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

2816
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:01,960
Hahaha!

2817
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:04,720
Oh my god.

2818
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:04,880
Wait.

2819
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:06,100
Somebody lives here?

2820
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:08,220
Who the fuck lives here?

2821
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:08,860
Hahaha!

2822
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:09,920
Let him cook.

2823
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:12,180

2824
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:12,680

2825
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:13,180
Thank you.

2826
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:14,420
Are we like...

2827
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:16,540
No we are... Are we in Europe?

2828
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:21,140
Guys the UK is not in Europe anymore because of...

2829
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:23,340
Because...

2830
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:24,260
Because of Brexit.

2831
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:25,340
Hahaha!

2832
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:27,580

01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:33,280
The Fargoons.

2835
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:35,580
Alright.

2836
01:47:36,100 --> 01:47:37,000
Does he know?

2837
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:39,580
Dude!

2838
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:41,080
Somebody's dog is here!

2839
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,280
They brought their dogs!

2840
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:44,200
Hahaha!

2841
01:47:46,820 --> 01:47:48,180

2843
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:51,420
Wait is this it?

2844
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:54,120
Oh shit!

01:47:55,120 --> 01:47:56,560
Wait what the fuck?

2846
01:47:56,780 --> 01:47:57,460

2847
01:47:57,460 --> 01:47:59,520

2848
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:03,040
Wait why did you take us here?

2849
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:04,160

2850
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:06,280
Why did you take us to a fucking...

2851
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:07,420
Okay we are like...

2852
01:48:07,420 --> 01:48:07,560

We are literally just...

2855
01:48:14,370 --> 01:48:15,750
What do you want me to have?

2856
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:20,340
Literally on this mad simoncraft chair.

2857
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:23,200
Why did you take us to the jungle temple?

2858
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:24,720
Wait...

2859
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:25,840

2861
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:31,800
I'm trusting this process less and less right now.

2862
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:33,040
Hahaha!

2863
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:36,500

01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:39,560
He stopped for a temple.

2866
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:42,200
I don't think he actually knows.

2867
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:44,100

01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:47,580

01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,100
I don't know.

2870
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:53,920
I'm starting to think he doesn't actually know where it is.

2871
01:48:55,100 --> 01:48:56,460
I don't...

2872
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:56,940

2873
01:48:57,820 --> 01:48:58,500

01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:45,560
Oh my god!

2931
01:50:45,660 --> 01:50:48,480

01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:54,700
He was actually baiting us.

2934
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,440
Oh my god.

2935
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:58,520

I can't believe it.

2945
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:13,180
He was a new world spy.

2946
01:51:13,820 --> 01:51:15,520
I'm calling it now.

2947
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:18,540
He was a fucking new world spy.

2948
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:19,980
Hehehehehe.

2949
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:21,340
Hahaha.

2950
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,760
He did it for the new world.

2951
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:26,860
Now it...

2952
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:28,900
The sleeper agent.

2953
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:31,960
Follow that man over there.

2954
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:33,520
Follow Corso.

2955
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:33,620
Follow Corso.

2956
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:33,980
He's gonna do something.

2957
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:37,940
They told you since the nether.

2958
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:39,580
Hahaha.

2959
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:45,920
I can't believe it.

2960
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:46,980
Follow him!

2961
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:49,720
He knows where the end is.

2962
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:52,800
If we doesn't...

2963
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,220
We know what we do to spies.

2964
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:56,620
Hehehehehe.

2965
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:57,640
Hahaha.

2966
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:01,560
I should have killed him when we came back from the nether.

2967
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:02,460
I...

2968
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:04,980
But you all told me to give him a chance.

2969
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:05,580
Hahaha.

2970
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:06,780
You all said...

2971
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:08,520
You don't believe in him.

2972
01:52:08,660 --> 01:52:10,420
He's not fucking you over.

2973
01:52:11,540 --> 01:52:12,200
Hahaha.

2974
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:13,580
Believe in him.

2975
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:15,380
I fucking knew it.

2976
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:17,180
I knew he was a spy.

2977
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:18,060
Hahaha.

2978
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:21,700
Hahaha.

2979
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:24,880
Follow him.

2980
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:26,560
He knows where it is.

2981
01:52:27,370 --> 01:52:28,160
He knows...

2982
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:30,320
He must know where it is.

2983
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:32,200
I believe in him.

2984
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,960
I believe in our new leader.

2985
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:36,660
Hahaha.

2986
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:37,100
Hahaha.

2987
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:38,200
Hahaha.

2988
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:38,900
Hahaha.

2989
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:39,860
Hahaha.

2990
01:52:39,860 --> 01:52:40,320
Hahaha.

2991
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:41,320
Hahaha.

2992
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:49,600
Hahaha.

2993
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:53,680
Hahaha.

2994
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:55,480
Hahaha.

2995
01:52:55,540 --> 01:52:55,980
Hahaha.

2996
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:58,300
Hahaha.

2997
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:02,420
Don't worry.

2998
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:06,780
Guys, we can't end stream until we defeat the Ender Dragon.

2999
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:09,240
Guys, we can't!

3000
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:13,060
You guys haven't won yet!

3001
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:16,400
You guys haven't beat the Ender Dragon yet!

3002
01:53:19,580 --> 01:53:21,620
You guys haven't done it yet.

3003
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:24,260
No, we're doing this legit!

3004
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:26,200
We're doing this legit!

3005
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:29,740
He knows where it is!

3006
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:30,780
He knows!

3007
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:31,460
Corvo knows!

3008
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,620
Corvo, what do you see?

3009
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:36,660
What do you see, Corvo?

3010
01:53:39,380 --> 01:53:41,980
Do you feel the stronghold?

3011
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:43,040
Do you feel it?

3012
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:52,460
What does he feel?

3013
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:54,540
Does he also feel the air?

3014
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:57,980
Wait, I lost... Where did Corvo go?

3015
01:53:58,300 --> 01:53:59,580
Why are we killing cows?

3016
01:54:00,220 --> 01:54:01,500
Wait, where did Corvo go?

3017
01:54:01,700 --> 01:54:02,840
Where did the fucking...

3018
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:05,140
Where did the Monokuma go?

3019
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:06,640
Guys!

3020
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:17,680
Guys...

3021
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:20,540
Guys...

3022
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:25,080
Guys...

3023
01:54:29,220 --> 01:54:29,840
What's that?

3024
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:33,480
No, I didn't know what you were talking about.

3025
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:35,160
That was my BGM, guys.

3026
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:44,080
Guys, we don't know exactly what that sound could be.

3027
01:54:44,700 --> 01:54:46,460
Guys, we don't know!

3028
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:48,380
Guys, it's not over yet!

3029
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:51,140
Guys, we don't know what that sound was.

3030
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:53,300
Okay, that's not Corvo.

3031
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:55,640
Alright, we... That's okay, that's not him.

3032
01:54:58,360 --> 01:55:01,620
Guys, we don't know who that was!

3033
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:03,520
That could be anything!

3034
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:05,240
That could be anything!

3035
01:55:05,700 --> 01:55:07,320
We don't know if it's the new Wargoon.

3036
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:08,600
They have to send a pigeon letter.

3037
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:15,000
Guys, we don't know yet, guys.

3038
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:16,420
We don't know yet.

3039
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:18,660
They haven't had their tea party moment yet.

3040
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:19,120
We don't know.

3041
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:20,640
That could have been anybody.

3042
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:23,060
Guys, I lost... I lost the guy.

3043
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:23,920
I lost him.

3044
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:25,140
It's too late.

3045
01:55:25,340 --> 01:55:26,820
I lost... Oh, sleeping through this night.

3046
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:27,500
Oh, wait.

3047
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:28,520
The moment of stay time.

3048
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:28,940
We'll see.

3049
01:55:29,260 --> 01:55:30,460
Yeah, that could have been the Wither.

3050
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:31,260
We don't know yet.

3051
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,420
Yeah, that could have been anything.

3052
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:37,600
We don't know exactly what that sound was.

3053
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:38,560
Alright, where is it?

3054
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:40,440
Corvo, where is it?

3055
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:44,960
Where is... I don't know what you're looking at, but I hope you actually know what you're doing.

3056
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:48,000
Okay, bad man.

3057
01:55:49,220 --> 01:55:50,340
It's not fair!

3058
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:52,440
We had a secret agent!

3059
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:57,840
We literally had a plant!

3060
01:55:58,940 --> 01:56:03,260
That fucked us over!

3061
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:06,440
We should have...

3062
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:15,140
We should have... Our competent leaders all died under mysterious circumstances.

3063
01:56:16,060 --> 01:56:17,900
That could have been anything.

3064
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:19,200
That could have been a bird!

3065
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:21,660
You know the birds can, like, repeat stuff?

3066
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:23,260
The birds repeat mods?

3067
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:25,680
No way!

3068
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:30,040
You don't know that!

3069
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:33,420
New World Graven member already killed three Ender Dragons.

3070
01:56:33,740 --> 01:56:34,840
We don't know that!

3071
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:35,780
There's no proof!

3072
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:38,040
They don't even have stream proof!

3073
01:56:38,620 --> 01:56:41,400
There's no proof that the New World goons did it!

3074
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:43,440
Guys, I lost our leader.

3075
01:56:43,740 --> 01:56:44,940
Where did our leader go?

3076
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:47,740
Guys, where did he go?

3077
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:50,340
Guys, where did Corvo go?

3078
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:52,400
Are we following the right people?

3079
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:54,540
Like... guys...

3080
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:56,720
Guys, I think we...

3081
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:58,420
We lost the leader.

3082
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:00,120
Guys, we lost the leader.

3083
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:04,240
Guys, where did he go?

3084
01:57:05,220 --> 01:57:06,280
Guys, where...

3085
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:07,940
Where did he go, guys?

3086
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:08,840
I lost him!

3087
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:11,940
Where did the leader...

3088
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:13,320
Guys, where did he go?

3089
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:15,480
Where did the bear go?

3090
01:57:18,730 --> 01:57:19,850
Oh no...

3091
01:57:20,590 --> 01:57:22,130
Guys, I don't see him.

3092
01:57:22,650 --> 01:57:24,530
Guys, I don't see the bear anymore.

3093
01:57:25,890 --> 01:57:26,730
I don't...

3094
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:28,710
I don't see him, guys.

3095
01:57:29,390 --> 01:57:30,750
Guys, we lost...

3096
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:32,070
Oh no...

3097
01:57:32,070 --> 01:57:33,670
Guys, we lost the leader.

3098
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:35,810
Guys...

3099
01:57:36,350 --> 01:57:36,870
Where...

3100
01:57:36,870 --> 01:57:37,150
Where...

3101
01:57:37,150 --> 01:57:38,310
Are we gonna find...

3102
01:57:38,310 --> 01:57:41,910
Guys, I have a feeling none of you guys actually know where he is.

3103
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:45,490
Guys, I have a feeling none of you guys actually know where...

3104
01:57:45,490 --> 01:57:46,510
Where Corvo is.

3105
01:57:46,930 --> 01:57:48,070
Guys, how do we teleport?

3106
01:57:48,450 --> 01:57:50,670
Guys, how do we teleport but not TP all?

3107
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:57,400
Where's Corvo?

3108
01:57:58,320 --> 01:57:59,220
Where is he?

3109
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:02,020
That's not Corvo, they're just building new...

3110
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:03,920
They're just building new towers.

3111
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:09,740
I'm not blind!

3112
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:10,920
I don't see him!

3113
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:12,060
Oh, is he over there?

3114
01:58:16,300 --> 01:58:17,600
Did you guys know?

3115
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:19,020
Wait, he knows!

3116
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:19,820
He knows!

3117
01:58:20,180 --> 01:58:21,400
He actually knows!

3118
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:26,040
He knows!

3119
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:30,920
Wait, new leader.

3120
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:34,200
Guys.

3121
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:35,440
Guys.

3122
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:37,700
Where did the leader go?

3123
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:38,820
Guys.

3124
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,460
Guys, where did the leader go?

3125
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,680
Where did the new leader go?

3126
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:45,840
He took us to water and I lost him!

3127
01:58:49,580 --> 01:58:50,520
No, I'm gonna die!

3128
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:52,200
Oh.

3129
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:52,780
Oh god.

3130
01:58:53,540 --> 01:58:53,980
Guys.

3131
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:56,160
Guys, where's the new leader?

3132
01:58:56,900 --> 01:58:58,160
Guys, we lost him!

3133
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:00,640
He took us to the water and he disappeared!

3134
01:59:01,020 --> 01:59:01,740
Oh wait, no, there he is!

3135
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:02,160
There he is!

3136
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:03,320
New leader!

3137
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:04,520
He knows!

3138
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:04,880
He knows!

3139
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:07,420
Do you actually know?

3140
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:09,340
Are you fucking with us too?

3141
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:10,880
Do you ask your new leader?

3142
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:14,420
Do you know?

3143
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:15,480
Does he know?

3144
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:20,860
Guys, we need to kill the ender dragon, please.

3145
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:22,360
Alright.

3146
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:29,100
The only leader... Alright.

3147
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:30,860
Show me the ender pearl!

3148
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:40,340
If you wanna be a leader, you have to have the ender pearl on you.

3149
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:41,720
Right now.

3150
01:59:45,540 --> 01:59:47,100
I need to see a pearl.

3151
01:59:47,340 --> 01:59:51,220
I need to see... I need to see the pearl.

3152
01:59:51,540 --> 01:59:55,520
Whoever has the pearl, can be the leader.

3153
01:59:57,480 --> 02:00:01,500
Whoever has the pearl gets to be the leader.

3154
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:03,900
Do none of you have pearls?

3155
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:05,500
Do you...

3156
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:11,420
Oh, sorry.

3157
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:12,580
The ender eye.

3158
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:13,960
Do none of you...

3159
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:17,820
The eye of ender...

3160
02:00:17,820 --> 02:00:18,380
Do none...

3161
02:00:18,380 --> 02:00:20,060
That is not the eye of...

3162
02:00:20,060 --> 02:00:21,620
None of you have eye of ender.

3163
02:00:21,740 --> 02:00:24,160
Do none of you...

3164
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:31,640
Guys, I don't think any of...

3165
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:41,480
Guys, I don't think any of...

3166
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:47,100
Guys, I don't think any of...

3167
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:49,340
Guys, I don't think any of...

3168
02:00:49,340 --> 02:00:52,000
Guys, I don't think any of...

3169
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:57,660
Guys, I don't think any of...

3170
02:00:57,660 --> 02:00:57,780
Guys, I don't think any of...

3171
02:00:57,780 --> 02:00:57,800
Guys, I don't think any of...

3172
02:00:57,800 --> 02:00:59,020
Guys, I don't think any of...

3173
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:05,880
Okay.

3174
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:18,720
I have... I think none of them actually knew.

3175
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:22,460
I don't think anybody... none of them actually knew.

3176
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:23,980
Okay.

3177
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:26,440
Okay.

3178
02:01:27,540 --> 02:01:28,180
I...

3179
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:33,900
Who could have known?

3180
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:35,360
The pee-pee towers.

3181
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:36,960
Alright.

3182
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:40,440
I left them stranded in the middle of nowhere.

3183
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:41,560
That's their new home now.

3184
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:45,000
That's... that's... that's their new home.

3185
02:01:46,220 --> 02:01:48,420
I picked the wrong team.

3186
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:53,000
That's... that's their new home now.

3187
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:53,960
And...

3188
02:01:53,980 --> 02:01:56,080
That's... that's... that's where they're gonna live.

3189
02:01:56,740 --> 02:01:57,020
Alright!

3190
02:01:57,560 --> 02:01:59,840
Who has the Eye of Ender?

3191
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:07,540
Do any dragoons have...

3192
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:10,540
the Eye of Ender?

3193
02:02:12,020 --> 02:02:13,040
Anybody here?

3194
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:14,640
You guys are the people I left stranded!

3195
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:16,720
How did you guys get back here?

3196
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:18,220
I left you guys stranded!

3197
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:19,920
Alright.

3198
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,360
Okay.

3199
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:22,540
It's teleport...

3200
02:02:22,540 --> 02:02:23,640
How do I do this?

3201
02:02:24,700 --> 02:02:25,220
TP...

3202
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:27,760
TP...

3203
02:02:28,720 --> 02:02:29,240
Alright.

3204
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:29,620
Who...

3205
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:30,480
What, Orca?

3206
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:32,200
Alright.

3207
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:35,860
We did it, guys.

3208
02:02:36,660 --> 02:02:37,180
Guys.

3209
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:37,800
We did it.

3210
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:40,120
Summon the Ender Dragon.

3211
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:41,120
What the fuck?

3212
02:02:41,140 --> 02:02:41,560
Who died?

3213
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:44,060
Summon the Ender Dragon!

3214
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:52,060
The queen is here now!

3215
02:02:52,060 --> 02:02:54,420
The queen is here!

3216
02:02:54,700 --> 02:02:57,060
I demand the new world!

3217
02:02:57,260 --> 02:02:59,660
The queen is here to get the taxes!

3218
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:01,100
We twit...

3219
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:01,500
No!

3220
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:02,700
No!

3221
02:03:03,420 --> 02:03:04,200
No!

3222
02:03:04,300 --> 02:03:06,660
The revolution has started!

3223
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:08,000
Oh!

3224
02:03:16,690 --> 02:03:18,190
Oh my god.

3225
02:03:18,350 --> 02:03:20,290
They tried to tea party me.

3226
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:22,810
They tried to tea party me.

3227
02:03:23,230 --> 02:03:25,530
Oh my god.

3228
02:03:28,770 --> 02:03:30,510
Those new world goons.

3229
02:03:30,590 --> 02:03:32,330
Those new world goons.

3230
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:33,030
They're crazy.

3231
02:03:33,450 --> 02:03:34,910
They're savages.

3232
02:03:35,590 --> 02:03:38,590
They're fucking savages over there.

3233
02:03:38,890 --> 02:03:40,590
Those new world goons.

3234
02:03:44,860 --> 02:03:46,040
Oh my god.

3235
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:47,520
This is why we left them.

3236
02:03:47,680 --> 02:03:50,740
Guys, this is why we left them on that island.

3237
02:03:51,120 --> 02:03:52,900
This is exactly why.

3238
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:56,040
Not you guys.

3239
02:03:56,140 --> 02:03:56,880
Old world goons.

3240
02:03:57,860 --> 02:03:58,580
My old world goons.

3241
02:03:58,580 --> 02:03:59,940
My old world goons.

3242
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:02,280
Don't worry.

3243
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:05,520
We won't let the new world goons do this to us.

3244
02:04:05,780 --> 02:04:06,460
Guys.

3245
02:04:06,580 --> 02:04:08,220
My old world goons.

3246
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:09,720
We will prosper.

3247
02:04:10,140 --> 02:04:12,760
I might not command the new world anymore.

3248
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:15,180
But we are not savages.

3249
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:16,400
Like them.

3250
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:17,480
We're not.

3251
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:24,660
We are the old world for a reason.

3252
02:04:24,660 --> 02:04:27,600
We have our other territories.

3253
02:04:27,880 --> 02:04:31,020
We have our other territories, guys.

3254
02:04:31,260 --> 02:04:34,000
The new world is not the only...

3255
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:39,700
The new world is not the only place that we have colonized.

3256
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:44,120
We have other places.

3257
02:04:44,380 --> 02:04:45,940
So do not worry.

3258
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:47,860
I believe in us.

3259
02:04:48,040 --> 02:04:50,560
I believe in us.

3260
02:04:51,980 --> 02:04:54,120
We have the rest of Europe.

3261
02:04:54,660 --> 02:04:55,320
Guys.

3262
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:02,200
The goddamn old world.

3263
02:05:02,260 --> 02:05:04,960
Thinking they can fight back to their queen.

3264
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:07,380
How dare they.

3265
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:09,780
How fucking dare they.

3266
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:12,830
Guys, I should not...

3267
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:16,120
The PP Tower was not a good form of government.

3268
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:18,180
Like, I have learned that now.

3269
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:19,560
We're never establishing...

3270
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:21,660
We have Germany.

3271
02:05:21,980 --> 02:05:22,560
Exactly.

3272
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:25,360
We literally have Germany and Lithuania.

3273
02:05:30,740 --> 02:05:32,560
Lina, thank you for the super sticker.

3274
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:33,120
Thank you.

3275
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:33,880
Thank you.

3276
02:05:36,140 --> 02:05:36,900
It's okay.

3277
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:40,660
The new world is still under my rule.

3278
02:05:42,300 --> 02:05:43,280
New world.

3279
02:05:43,340 --> 02:05:45,360
If you hear me now, new world.

3280
02:05:45,380 --> 02:05:48,720
I'm broadcasting my message to across the ocean.

3281
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:54,200
The new world, if you hear me, just so you know, I still...

3282
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:55,760
I have owner power.

3283
02:05:56,120 --> 02:05:59,160
I can destroy everything you love, new world.

3284
02:05:59,380 --> 02:05:59,840
I...

3285
02:06:00,340 --> 02:06:08,180
I can bring Flint over to the new world.

3286
02:06:08,220 --> 02:06:10,340
So don't piss me off.

3287
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:18,780
I still have perms over the new world.

3288
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:21,280
Let's see, I need eat...

3289
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:22,280
All right.

3290
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:23,080
A golden.

3291
02:06:23,140 --> 02:06:24,740
It'll be fine if I eat a golden.

3292
02:06:24,860 --> 02:06:26,640
A golden, a glistening melon.

3293
02:06:27,060 --> 02:06:28,180
It'll be fine.

3294
02:06:29,740 --> 02:06:31,060
It'll be fine, guys.

3295
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:33,400
I want to see how my dock is going.

3296
02:06:34,300 --> 02:06:35,960
My old world dock.

3297
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:38,360
All right, let's see.

3298
02:06:38,700 --> 02:06:41,200
Throw the taxes into the ocean.

3299
02:06:42,580 --> 02:06:43,800
They can't do that.

3300
02:06:44,140 --> 02:06:46,960
Like I said, I have old world power.

3301
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:49,280
We're back in Doki Land.

3302
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:52,580
Alright, how's the dock going?

3303
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:56,260
Port attempt made.

3304
02:06:58,820 --> 02:07:00,340
Subscribe- What the fuck?

3305
02:07:00,380 --> 02:07:01,740
Who the f- can you advertise?

3306
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:03,000
What?

3307
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:04,380
Who took the taxes?

3308
02:07:05,740 --> 02:07:07,360
Somebody took the taxes!

3309
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:09,640
Who

3310
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:14,720
yoinked my taxes?

3311
02:07:20,210 --> 02:07:22,730
This has to be the New World's doing.

3312
02:07:22,930 --> 02:07:23,890
There's no way.

3313
02:07:24,650 --> 02:07:27,090
This has to- Those fucking savages.

3314
02:07:27,570 --> 02:07:29,190
I can't believe it!

3315
02:07:29,530 --> 02:07:31,150
They teapot-ed me!

3316
02:07:32,170 --> 02:07:34,910
They actually teapot-ed me in the port!

3317
02:07:39,770 --> 02:07:42,130
They dumped it to the harbor!

3318
02:07:43,290 --> 02:07:45,530
Those f- Oh my god.

3319
02:07:45,610 --> 02:07:46,010
Guys.

3320
02:07:46,950 --> 02:07:49,770
I know I said like all dragoons are created equally.

3321
02:07:50,010 --> 02:07:50,890
Guys, I'm gonna make a speech.

3322
02:07:51,130 --> 02:07:53,630
I know I said all dragoons are created equally.

3323
02:07:53,770 --> 02:07:54,590
I need to be in Doki Land.

3324
02:07:54,970 --> 02:07:55,910
But like...

3325
02:07:56,590 --> 02:07:57,910
Those New World goons.

3326
02:07:58,610 --> 02:08:01,350
There's a reason why we banished them all the way back there.

3327
02:08:05,410 --> 02:08:11,050
I knew not doing public housing in the New World was a good idea.

3328
02:08:11,450 --> 02:08:15,950
Now they'll ne- If they try and ask for me to give them like...

3329
02:08:16,970 --> 02:08:18,850
To give them government funding.

3330
02:08:19,070 --> 02:08:21,790
I will never give them government funding.

3331
02:08:25,930 --> 02:08:27,450
You old world goons.

3332
02:08:27,670 --> 02:08:28,450
You guys.

3333
02:08:28,510 --> 02:08:29,890
You guys are special.

3334
02:08:30,330 --> 02:08:31,830
Those New World goons.

3335
02:08:31,970 --> 02:08:34,390
I know I said all dragoons are created equally.

3336
02:08:34,750 --> 02:08:36,670
But the New World goons.

3337
02:08:37,050 --> 02:08:38,610
They are not as equal.

3338
02:08:44,750 --> 02:08:47,010
Are we really gonna let them?

3339
02:08:47,150 --> 02:08:49,270
Are we really gonna let them?

3340
02:08:49,750 --> 02:08:52,290
Dump our taxes into the ocean?

3341
02:08:58,290 --> 02:09:01,510
Some goons are more equal than others.

3342
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:06,110
Oh my god.

3343
02:09:06,250 --> 02:09:07,230
That's fun though.

3344
02:09:07,230 --> 02:09:08,010
Legoland.

3345
02:09:08,110 --> 02:09:09,070
What the fuck?

3346
02:09:09,110 --> 02:09:10,250
Where's Legoland?

3347
02:09:10,630 --> 02:09:11,950
Is this Legoland?

3348
02:09:14,870 --> 02:09:16,190
There's savages.

3349
02:09:16,330 --> 02:09:16,830
Savages.

3350
02:09:16,910 --> 02:09:18,410
Barely even human.

3351
02:09:22,130 --> 02:09:23,670
Oh my god.

3352
02:09:23,790 --> 02:09:26,530
They try to fight back to your queen.

3353
02:09:28,050 --> 02:09:29,270
How could they?

3354
02:09:34,050 --> 02:09:35,370
Oh my god.

3355
02:09:35,370 --> 02:09:36,590
Hey guys.

3356
02:09:37,550 --> 02:09:38,450
What the fuck?

3357
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:39,270
How did you guys get here?

3358
02:09:39,770 --> 02:09:41,870
Why the fuck did you guys jump on top?

3359
02:09:42,790 --> 02:09:43,310
Wait.

3360
02:09:43,350 --> 02:09:44,490
How did you guys do that?

3361
02:09:45,650 --> 02:09:46,170
Wait.

3362
02:09:46,270 --> 02:09:46,730
What?

3363
02:09:47,170 --> 02:09:47,690
Oh.

3364
02:09:47,970 --> 02:09:49,310
I thought you can't build there.

3365
02:09:49,630 --> 02:09:50,210
Alright guys.

3366
02:09:51,590 --> 02:09:53,130
I also wanna slash this.

3367
02:09:53,310 --> 02:09:54,030
I'm gonna call it here.

3368
02:09:54,370 --> 02:09:55,150
It's been fun.

3369
02:09:55,430 --> 02:09:56,630
I definitely had...

3370
02:09:56,630 --> 02:09:58,510
We had no BGM after...

3371
02:09:58,510 --> 02:10:00,610
After what happened...

3372
02:10:01,690 --> 02:10:02,210
Um...

3373
02:10:03,210 --> 02:10:05,030
After what happened today...

3374
02:10:05,030 --> 02:10:06,390
I'll put the BGM back on.

3375
02:10:06,730 --> 02:10:08,310
But after what happened...

3376
02:10:08,310 --> 02:10:11,150
With being led in the wild goose chase...

3377
02:10:11,150 --> 02:10:13,010
I have got rid of the BGM.

3378
02:10:13,350 --> 02:10:14,550
Because that's what we deserve.

3379
02:10:15,230 --> 02:10:15,710
But...

3380
02:10:15,710 --> 02:10:18,330
I had a lot of fun with all you guys today.

3381
02:10:18,430 --> 02:10:20,350
I cannot wait to play more on the...

3382
02:10:20,350 --> 02:10:21,970
Dragoon server in the future.

3383
02:10:22,490 --> 02:10:22,970
Um...

3384
02:10:22,970 --> 02:10:25,590
And also improve the server for all of you guys.

3385
02:10:25,830 --> 02:10:27,510
I can't wait to improve the server.

3386
02:10:27,610 --> 02:10:28,710
If you guys have like...

3387
02:10:28,710 --> 02:10:30,690
Any notes you guys wanna do...

3388
02:10:30,690 --> 02:10:31,070

3389
02:10:31,070 --> 02:10:32,010
Like stuff to do...

3390
02:10:32,010 --> 02:10:33,130
Improve the server...

3391
02:10:33,130 --> 02:10:34,930
Like any ideas you wanna add...

3392
02:10:34,930 --> 02:10:36,630
We're gonna implement a better chat system...

3393
02:10:36,630 --> 02:10:37,950
So people can chat with others...

3394
02:10:37,950 --> 02:10:38,550
Within groups...

3395
02:10:38,550 --> 02:10:39,610
Within factions...

3396
02:10:39,610 --> 02:10:40,110
Um...

3397
02:10:40,110 --> 02:10:41,670
But you have any ideas or anything...

3398
02:10:41,670 --> 02:10:42,450
Regarding like...

3399
02:10:42,450 --> 02:10:43,990
How to improve this Dragoon server...

3400
02:10:43,990 --> 02:10:44,890
Feel free to...

3401
02:10:44,890 --> 02:10:46,850
Comment on the VOD itself...

3402
02:10:46,850 --> 02:10:47,970
And then we'll look through the VOD.

3403
02:10:48,330 --> 02:10:48,770
Um...

3404
02:10:48,770 --> 02:10:50,550
And then obviously I will host like events...

3405
02:10:50,550 --> 02:10:52,370
I will redecorate some parts here...

3406
02:10:52,370 --> 02:10:54,330
I will have more quality of life changes...

3407
02:10:54,330 --> 02:10:55,530
But I definitely had...

3408
02:10:55,530 --> 02:10:56,390
Oh my god...

3409
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:57,410

3410
02:10:58,610 --> 02:10:59,050

3417
02:11:05,130 --> 02:11:07,270
We finally have our server now...

3418
02:11:07,270 --> 02:11:08,070
Um...

3419
02:11:08,070 --> 02:11:09,190
Why is there a boat here?

3420
02:11:09,290 --> 02:11:11,130
I'm really happy that we finally...

3421
02:11:11,130 --> 02:11:13,030
Got our server up and going...

3422
02:11:13,030 --> 02:11:16,110

3423
02:11:16,110 --> 02:11:16,610

3431
02:11:24,910 --> 02:11:25,710
Posture check...

3432
02:11:25,710 --> 02:11:26,570
Get up and move around...

3433
02:11:26,570 --> 02:11:27,690
To get that blood flowing...

3434
02:11:27,690 --> 02:11:28,270
And if you...

3435
02:11:28,270 --> 02:11:29,130
Stay up for me...

3436
02:11:29,130 --> 02:11:29,990
Hit the bed...

3437
02:11:29,990 --> 02:11:31,430
