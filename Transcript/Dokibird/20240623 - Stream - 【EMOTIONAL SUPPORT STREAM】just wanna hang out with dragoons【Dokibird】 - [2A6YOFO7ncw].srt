00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,130
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,470
Sorry.

3
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:56,410
I think if I sound really sad, I think I have a reason to be sad today.

4
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,050
Sorry, I'm sad.

5
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,450
I'm sad laughing.

6
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:08,850
I'm trying not to cry because I'm very emotional right now.

7
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:15,130
I think this is why I really wanted to stream today.

8
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,770
Still, because I know if I don't, I'm just gonna cry.

9
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:29,930
But talking to you guys always make me really happy, cheers me up, and I know that...

10
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,310
I know that I'll stop crying if I get to just hang out with my dragoons.

11
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,350
Thank you everybody!

12
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,350
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,210
It was super out of my control.

14
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:04,070
I was trying to find a way to have... what's the word?

15
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,930
A compromise?

16
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:12,930
Because I said I was willing to delay the stream for like one and a half hours max.

17
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,190
But I was told...

18
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,150
I was told that...

19
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,790
It wasn't enough time.

20
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:35,110
And that for the best option, it was to be pushed back to tomorrow.

21
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,910
Sorry!

22
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,050
I know I shouldn't cry.

23
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,970
I know it's just silly.

24
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,070
It's a silly thing to cry about.

25
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,970
But the team did work really hard.

26
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:54,530
When tomorrow, please don't blame the project team.

27
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:02,650
Everybody that worked on it, some of them had to do crunch hours.

28
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,110
And they basically...

29
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,650
They...

30
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,410
I know like...

31
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,850
Some of them basically really haven't slept the last two hours.

32
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,250
Two days.

33
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,630
So they were trying really hard to get it done in time.

34
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,790
And at that point, like...

35
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,730
We were like...

36
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,370
Everybody was just like, it's just not possible.

37
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:42,630
And yeah, I would have liked to be informed earlier because I was open to pushing the date back a day or two.

38
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,610
But...

39
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,810
Everyone thought that it was possible.

40
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:56,390
So I wasn't informed until the last 10 to 15 minutes before the stream was about to start.

41
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,230
That it was just...

42
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,050
At that point, it wouldn't be ready in time.

43
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:07,130
The reason why I didn't want to push...

44
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,310
I didn't really want to push it back.

45
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,910
Too far.

46
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,250
Is that...

47
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:16,910
Because like...

48
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,250
There was another option.

49
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:23,670
It was to basically delay the stream 3 to 4 hours.

50
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,230
And...

51
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,670
Or like 2 to 4 hours.

52
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,930
And at that point, I was like...

53
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,830
It's just better to push it to tomorrow.

54
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,450
I was just like...

55
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,730
If the delay is going to be like 2 to 4 hours.

56
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,550
At that point, like...

57
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,330
We might as well just...

58
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,510
Stream on Sunday.

59
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,270
Like have the reveal on Sunday.

60
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,990
And...

61
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,310
Because like...

62
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,610
I know there's an overlap.

63
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,270
I'm not going to play dumb about it.

64
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,350
I...

65
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,690
I know there was going to be an overlap.

66
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,110
And I just...

67
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,750
I know people...

68
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,030
I don't want to force people to...

69
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,530
Make a decision.

70
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,890
And stuff.

71
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,330
And...

72
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,490
Um...

73
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,490
Because...

74
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:17,910
You know...

75
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,350
Both...

76
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,970
Both events are incredibly...

77
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,650
Hype and everything.

78
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,690
And...

79
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,790
Um...

80
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,450
I felt that...

81
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,210
Like...

82
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,090
At that point...

83
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,230
If it's going to be delayed...

84
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,170
To...

85
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,070
2 to 4 hours.

86
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,830
It was just...

87
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,070
It was just...

88
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,690
At that point, I might as well just push it to tomorrow.

89
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,810
So I had to make...

90
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,270
The incredibly...

91
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,630
Uh...

92
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,390
Tough decision...

93
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,970
To just...

94
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,930
Uh...

95
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,330
Just have it...

96
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,170
For tomorrow.

97
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:49,690
And stuff.

98
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,570
Because I didn't want to rush.

99
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,490
It wasn't just this project team.

100
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,130
A lot of...

101
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:55,950
Um...

102
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,070
There's like...

103
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,530
Other people outside of the project team.

104
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,190
That also worked...

105
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,910
Incredibly hard...

106
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,810
Uh...

107
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,390
To have it done...

108
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,190
By...

109
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,050
This deadline.

110
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,690
Um...

111
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:08,890
Um...

112
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,350
And it wouldn't be fair...

113
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,750
To their efforts...

114
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,130
If...

115
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,730
Uh...

116
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,370
I had to rush that...

117
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,670
To rush my...

118
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,350
Uh...

119
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:18,890
New...

120
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,250
Skinsuit reveal...

121
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,310
Um...

122
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,190
Just because...

123
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,850
I didn't...

124
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,510
I was...

125
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,870
I...

126
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,350
Didn't want to overlap...

127
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,150
Or anything...

128
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,850
Uh...

129
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,570
Because I know...

130
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:27,910
Like...

131
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,930
There's also like...

132
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,370
I know...

133
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:29,750
There's...

134
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,370
Like...

135
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,510
Debut fatigue...

136
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,950
And stuff like that...

137
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,430
I...

138
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,610
I hope you guys...

139
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,530
Won't be...

140
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,790
You know...

141
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,870
Too tired...

142
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,890
Of debut stuff...

143
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,630
Re-debut...

144
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,650
Debut stuff...

145
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,730
By tomorrow...

146
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,710
Um...

147
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,570
And...

148
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,290
Um...

149
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,610
Uh...

150
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,890
And...

151
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,530
I really do hope...

152
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,090
Like...

153
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,130
Uh...

154
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,550
You guys...

155
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,210
Uh...

156
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,090
I know...

157
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:55,650
I know...

158
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,910
It won't be as hyped...

159
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,710
If I...

160
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,910
If I did the reveal today...

161
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,350
Versus tomorrow...

162
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,290
I know...

163
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:02,590
Like...

164
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,370
Tomorrow...

165
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,490
A lot of you guys did open up your schedule...

166
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:05,510
And...

167
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,930
I'm really...

168
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,670
Really really do apologize...

169
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,430
Um...

170
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,270
Cause...

171
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:12,850
You know...

172
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,290
It...

173
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,310
You guys...

174
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,410
It's not...

175
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,030
I guess I would...

176
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,690
Wanted to stream today as well...

177
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,650
Cause I still wanted to...

178
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,110
You know...

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,510

180
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,270
You guys...

181
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:21,910
Uh...

182
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,230
Gave up...

183
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,550
Your own schedule...

184
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,210
To like...

185
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:26,510
You know...

186
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,110
Watch...

187
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,670

188
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,130
Watch silly me...

Yeah...

192
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,490
I still wanted to hang out with you guys...

193
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,890
I still wanted to stream...

194
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,890
Cause you guys gave up your schedule to be there for me...

195
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,370
So...

196
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,790
I still hope you guys...

197
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,190
Uh...

198
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,010
Will still...

199
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,390
For those who won't be able to be there tomorrow...

200
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,490
I still hope you will enjoy the vibe...

201
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:55,770
Uh...

202
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,770
Because everybody worked so hard...

203
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,730
For it...

204
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:03,920
Sorry...

205
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,960
I know a little trick...

206
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,100
For those who...

207
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,360
Wanna stop crying...

208
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,060
If you don't have...

209
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,480
Uh...

210
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,740
If you don't have a stream...

211
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,920
To hang out with...

212
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,100
I'm gonna...

213
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,680
But...

214
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,760
A little trick...

215
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,440
Is that...

216
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,100
I learned this from...

217
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,460
Uh...

218
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,400
Volleyball...

219
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,460
I learned this from varsity volleyball...

220
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,240
But basically...

221
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,260
Cause I was crying...

222
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,000
Uh...

223
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,340
Uh...

224
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,600
Cause I got...

225
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,440
I was like...

226
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,900
I got scolded by my coach...

227
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,860
For...

228
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,520
Uh...

229
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,460
Being late...

230
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,040
For...

231
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,380
Uh...

232
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,460
A game...

233
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,540
And...

234
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,900
Um...

235
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,000
I was crying...

236
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,800
Cause I was like...

237
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,600
I'm sorry...

238
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,300
I was late...

239
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,840
And then...

240
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,220
My coach was like...

241
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,000
Uh...

242
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,120
My coach was like...

243
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,980
Drink water...

244
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,440
So you'll stop crying...

245
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,420
And it works...

246
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,560
She was just like...

247
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,120
If you're...

248
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,680
If you wanna cry...

249
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,280
And you can't stop crying...

250
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,860
If you...

251
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,820
You're crying...

252
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,080
And you...

253
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,920
And you suddenly...

254
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,180
And you drink water...

255
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,380
You'll stop crying...

256
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,100
And it works!

257
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,200
It does work!

258
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,580
I don't know how it does that...

259
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,300
But like...

260
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,000
I stopped crying!

261
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,860
Cause I just suddenly drank water...

262
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,340
And I started to cry...

263
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,030
So...

264
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,130
Right...

265
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,250
Like...

266
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:17,510
It was just for real...

267
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,170
And true...

268
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:18,830
Um...

269
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,690
But yes...

270
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,810
Um...

271
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,470
Hm...

272
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,450
I had to...

273
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,090
I get really emotional...

274
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,610
I think it's also...

275
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,330
Cause...

276
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,070
Uh...

277
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,090
It...

278
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:31,890
Um...

279
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,190
It's also...

280
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:34,890
Ah...

281
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:35,670
Like...

282
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,530
I'm really emotional...

283
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,170
Because I've been really stressed out...

284
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,490
And I know my project team...

285
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,530
I bet they've been...

286
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:42,810
They...

287
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,170
I know they've been incredibly stressed out as well...

288
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,130
Due to like...

289
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:22,310
Well, that worked incredibly hard for this particular project.

290
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,310
And I know they must have been super anxious.

291
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,450
They didn't want to tell me that there was going to be a delay, which I would understand.

292
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,190
Which I, of course, 100% understand.

293
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:39,230
Because I won't be surprised if they thought that...

294
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,450
They wanted to push as much as they can to get it done by today.

295
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,230
Which I don't blame them.

296
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,810
Of course, it is still sad that...

297
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,990
We've been hyping it for a week and everything.

298
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,710
And then just to hit that...

299
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,150
Snack.

300
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,050
But like I said, this team...

301
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:07,850
Was the most I've ever employed to work on something like this.

302
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:14,850
So, I know I've never had a delay that delayed this much before.

303
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,430
When it came to like...

304
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,710
Special events or special projects that I work on.

305
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:24,030
Like I try to make due with at least like one to two hours.

306
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,870
And if like the project team is watching this right now.

307
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,750
I'm sorry if I said some harsh words on the survey.

308
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,050
On the Discord survey.

309
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,530
I don't know if I was like really blunt here.

310
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,090
I don't know.

311
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,750
When I get really emotional, I can get like super blunt.

312
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,970
And I just... I don't fluff my words.

313
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,650
And I really apologize.

314
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,690
Because I do get like really emotional to the point where I don't fluff my words.

315
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,750
When I type.

316
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,390
You know like when you don't have...

317
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,890
When like...

318
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,150
When you're typing your words.

319
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,390
Like when you're typing in...

320
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,750
Like chat and stuff.

321
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,210
And...

322
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,090
And...

323
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,550
Like in chat and stuff.

324
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:15,910
And you don't know what the emotion behind it is.

325
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,430
But...

326
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,370
When you're typing words and stuff.

327
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,070
Because you're not saying it.

328
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,890
You're not saying it and stuff.

329
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:22,550
And...

330
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,810
And yeah like texting.

331
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:26,850
When you're texting it.

332
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,010
And so like I wasn't like fluffing my words and stuff.

333
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,990
I was like to the point.

334
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:32,810
Like very blunt.

335
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,370
And I was like please in the future.

336
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,130
Please let me know.

337
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,950
Like ahead of time.

338
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,550
Like...

339
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,590
I would have... I understand.

340
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,050
Like I would have understood.

341
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,310
If... so it's like a learning lesson for all of us.

342
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,710
So I was like.

343
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,750
I would have understand.

344
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,490
If you guys needed more time.

345
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,350
If there needed to be a delay.

346
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,650
Like maybe...

347
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,370
But you just needed to tell me earlier.

348
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,750
You just needed to tell me like maybe even like three hours earlier.

349
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,750
Or a day or two earlier.

350
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:05,310
Or a day or two earlier.

351
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,730
Like I would have understand.

352
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,750
I would have pushed it back.

353
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,010
Cause it's not fun to like...

354
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,150
Announce.

355
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,950
That it's been pushed back.

356
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,190
Like ten minutes before the stream started.

357
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,900
It's not.

358
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,450
It's not fun at all.

359
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,760
It's not fun at all.

360
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,200
It's not fun at all.

361
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,600
It's not fun at all.

362
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,320
It's not fun at all.

363
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,940
And so like.

364
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,500
It's really understandable.

365
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,140
And like.

366
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,080
There was just.

367
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,480
You know everybody was like really stressed out.

368
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,020
And cause they really really.

369
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:44,920
It's...

370
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,500
I hope you guys would.

371
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,300
Would.

372
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,080
Love tomorrow.

373
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,440
What we're bringing tomorrow.

374
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,060
Cause I know.

375
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,860
I know the hype won't be as hyped as today.

376
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,060
Because everybody was expecting it to be today.

377
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,380
Oh my god.

378
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,040
I need to.

379
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,840
Fuck okay.

380
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:07,100
I need to tell my new mama to not post.

381
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,980
Give me a sec.

382
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,720
I need to send a message.

383
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,180
That would.

384
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,580
Cause I gave a time.

385
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,280
I gave a time.

386
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,380
And I was like.

387
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,060
You can post it.

388
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,540
At this time.

389
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,120
I forgot.

390
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,800
Oh my god.

391
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,320
I'm sorry.

392
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,440
We are.

393
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,320
Pushing the stream.

394
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,940
Oh my god.

395
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,500
That was so fucking anti-climatic.

396
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,540
At least you know.

397
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,800
This is why it's good that I streamed.

398
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,640
Because I would have forgotten.

399
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,100
To message.

400
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,300
My mama.

401
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,700
To not post it.

402
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,040
Oh my god.

403
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,880
Cause I was like.

404
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,540
Yeah you can post it.

405
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,120
At this time.

406
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,940
Cause I think at that time.

407
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,340
Um.

408
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,580
Um.

409
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,240
It was like.

410
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,380
At this time.

411
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,080
That I should be done.

412
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,700
I should have my new skin suit.

413
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,440
Revealed.

414
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,860
And then they're like.

415
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,400
Okay.

416
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,780
And now I'm just like.

417
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,660
Oh shit okay.

418
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,200
We're pushing the stream.

419
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,220
Uh.

420
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,420
It was a huge delay.

421
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,080
That we couldn't.

422
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,100
Control.

423
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,840
Just wanted to let you know.

424
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,740
So you don't.

425
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:43,880
Accidentally.

426
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,660
Tweet it out.

427
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,880
Oh my god.

428
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,320
Oh please don't schedule.

429
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,160
Tweet.

430
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,340
That would've been so awkward.

431
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,560
Oh my god.

432
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,380
But yes we have to.

433
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,020
Me and my staff team.

434
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,880
Have to like.

435
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,960
Oh no.

436
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,460
Celia knows.

437
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,060
Celia knows that.

438
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,300
Cause they're in the server.

439
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,860
So they know that it's been.

440
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,500
Delayed.

441
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
The mama did not know.

442
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,560
So I needed to.

443
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,440
I needed to be like.

444
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,320
Oh okay please.

445
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,440
But yes like.

446
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,020
Um.

447
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,320
Oh.

448
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,040
I'm so scared.

449
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,100
I really hope it's not scheduled.

450
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,620
I hope it's not scheduled.

451
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,500
Alright we'll find out in an hour.

452
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,720
We'll stay until like an hour.

453
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,840
At least an hour to see like.

454
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,120
If it.

455
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,980
And then I'll just be like.

456
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,800
Surprise.

457
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,060
I.

458
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,200
Be like.

459
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,320
Surprise.

460
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,060
This was the reveal.

461
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,740
This entire time.

462
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,100
Okay.

463
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,200
Um.

464
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,420
What was I.

465
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,740
What was I gonna say.

466
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,440
Before that.

467
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,640
Um.

468
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,220
What was I gonna say before.

469
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,180
I was like oh fuck I need a message.

470
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,140
Uh.

471
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,060
I need to message my mama.

472
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,660
To not say anything.

473
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,220
To not accidentally post it.

474
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,040
Uh.

475
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,500
Um.

476
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,820
Where I messaged.

477
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,040
I messaged them on.

478
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:38,860
Uh.

479
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,760
On discord.

480
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,080
Um.

481
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,000
To not.

482
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,780
I don't know if they saw it yet.

483
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,840
So I'm just gonna wait.

484
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,560
Um.

485
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,520
Where.

486
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,380
Okay.

487
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,560
What was I saying before then.

488
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:50,840
Um.

489
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,840
Alright let's all be filled with anxiety for an hour.

490
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,380
That's great.

491
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,140
I basically just gave my chat.

492
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,600
Like now I gave my chat FOMO.

493
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,120
Because they're like oh no.

494
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,380
Now I have to stay.

495
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,120
Just to see if it actually gets revealed.

496
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,420
Now you can't leave.

497
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,300
Because now you have FOMO.

498
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,640
Um.

499
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:15,780
Um.

500
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,400
Anyway.

501
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,000
Anyway what was I saying before guys.

502
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:21,820
Uh.

503
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,620
No we're not gonna do a countdown.

504
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,360
That makes it worse.

505
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,180
That makes everything much worse.

506
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,040
Um.

507
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,280
I really appreciate like Mint messaged me about it.

508
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,180
And was like is everything okay.

509
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,780
And I was like no.

510
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,840
I literally replied back.

511
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,300
I was like no.

512
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,440
I'm crying.

513
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,360
Um.

514
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,860
I really appreciate like Mint messaged me.

515
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,160
And cheering me up.

516
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,180
Um.

517
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,580
And uh.

518
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,820
If anybody in the project team is watching.

519
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,920
Like I really apologize.

520
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,020
Uh.

521
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,160
For how blunt my words were.

522
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,900
Like I wasn't being like.

523
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,560
Guys for those who are wondering.

524
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,540
I wasn't being like.

525
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,860
I was just like.

526
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,620
You know we're all frustrated.

527
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,300
And I was just like.

528
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,400
We're all frustrated and stuff.

529
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,780
And we're all like stressed out.

530
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,520
Um.

531
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,500
And I was just like.

532
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,680
Basically I just like kept it straight.

533
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,320
I was just like.

534
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,920
Please just next time.

535
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,920
I know like I'm not corporate.

536
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,180
I'm just an indie.

537
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,500
But like please.

538
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,460
Next time I do appreciate if uh.

539
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,560
Uh.

540
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,620
If like I was told.

541
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,120
Like if I knew like ahead of time.

542
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,240
And I know I know.

543
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,020
Everybody is so stressed out about it.

544
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,160
And um.

545
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,140
And I really apologize how direct my words were.

546
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:44,760
For that.

547
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,480
Uh.

548
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,140
And I do get really emotional.

549
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:48,920
Um.

550
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,700
I actually stepped back after that.

551
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,420
Uh.

552
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,340
I invited.

553
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,440
Cause when that project server.

554
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,460
Um.

555
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,260
It was just.

556
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,120
I was basically overseeing everything.

557
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,640
And um.

558
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,080
Because of that.

559
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:08,600
Um.

560
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,720
From my experience.

561
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,100
I know when to step back.

562
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,020
Uh.

563
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,280
Like I need.

564
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:16,940
Like when I know.

565
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,560
Like you know from all my previous experiences.

566
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,260
Now I know when I have to just step back.

567
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,680
Cause I don't want to say something I regret in the future.

568
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,660
Um.

569
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,620
So like I said.

570
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,400
I told them straight.

571
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,940
I was just like.

572
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,700
I'm gonna go to the server.

573
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:37,740
Um.

574
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,320
And they're gonna handle all of this now.

575
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,120
They're gonna be my messenger.

576
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,660
Because I was like.

577
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,600
I don't know what I'm gonna.

578
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,340
I don't know what I was gonna say.

579
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,800
Cause I was so emotional.

580
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,100
I didn't want them to feel bad.

581
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:54,940
I didn't.

582
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,400
Cause I didn't want to like make them feel bad.

583
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,020
Or like accidentally guilt trip people.

584
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,640
So I was just like.

585
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,840
I need to be professional.

586
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,720
And I'm going to.

587
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,280
Put my staff member in the server.

588
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,120
And um.

589
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,520
And like.

590
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,380
My staff member is gonna handle it.

591
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,180
Like just being the messenger now.

592
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,360
Um.

593
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,580
And um.

594
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,080
And I'm gonna leave the server.

595
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,240
I'll join back when I.

596
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,040
Like I'll join back after the reveal.

597
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,400
Like when I've calmed down.

598
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,500
When I feel a lot.

599
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,820
Like after the reveal.

600
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,180
So yeah.

601
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:33,820
I like invited.

602
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,380
I told my staff member what was happening.

603
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,420
And then I was like.

604
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,780
Can you join the server?

605
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,600
And just like delegate everything for me.

606
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,620
And just like relay.

607
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,080
Send me the files.

608
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,840
And like relay stuff to me.

609
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,160
About everything if they need that from me.

610
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,780
And uh.

611
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,920
So then I just like.

612
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,160
I like invited.

613
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,800
I just invited my staff member.

614
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,240
And I gave them control of the server.

615
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:03,940
And I was like.

616
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,300
I'm out.

617
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,680
Cause I feel like I'm gonna say something really.

618
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,420
Really.

619
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,820
Like something I might.

620
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,920
Like might be like unprofessional.

621
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,840
Like I might get like super emotional.

622
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,160
And I don't want to guilt trip them.

623
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,160
I don't want to make them feel worse or anything.

624
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,580
Cause I can't help it.

625
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,720
When I get like super emotional.

626
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,760
Um.

627
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:26,280
And I'm worried that I might say something that might feel like guilt trippy or something.

628
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,220
Or like I didn't want to make them feel bad.

629
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,200
Or anything.

630
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,960
If I feel this way.

631
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,860
I am not.

632
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,820
I will not be surprised.

633
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,720
Like if I feel this way.

634
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,340
Like feeling incredibly emotional.

635
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,080
Um.

636
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:42,940
Um.

637
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,960
They are also feeling equally.

638
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,000
Or if not more so like terrible.

639
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,880
Uh.

640
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Or like terrible because they couldn't meet the deadline.

641
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,300
So that's why like.

642
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,220
Uh.

643
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,980
That's why.

644
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,740
Um.

645
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:58,900
Um.

646
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,320
I knew that I had to take a step back.

647
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,880
Because if anything.

648
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,680
I know like that team.

649
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,280
Like they literally some of them were pulling all nighters.

650
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,360
And stuff to make sure it was done by the deadline.

651
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:11,680
And.

652
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,580
Um.

653
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,680
Like I knew that like I had to.

654
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,520
Take a step back.

655
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,620
Because like you know.

656
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,720
I knew like the things I did type in the server.

657
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,800
Would must have like hurt them a lot.

658
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,840
Because like you know.

659
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,040
I was saying.

660
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,960
I said like I was just.

661
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,760
I was just sad.

662
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,680
You know like I was.

663
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I put my feelings on my sleeve.

664
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,800
And being like.

665
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,760
It's like they were like we are really sorry for the delay.

666
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,420
I was like it's okay I understand.

667
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,240
I am crying.

668
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,720
But I do understand.

669
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,000
And like stuff like that.

670
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,160
Like you know if I read that.

671
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,080
I would be like shit I feel terrible.

672
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,400
Because I made somebody cry.

673
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,220
Like obviously I couldn't stop myself.

674
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,040
Because like I'm like I'm upset.

675
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,940
And like stuff like that.

676
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,740
And I'm like I wish I didn't type that.

677
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,920
I wish I.

678
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,260
I wish I didn't type that for them to see it.

679
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,760
I wish I kept that in.

680
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,380
Um kept that within myself.

681
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,340
Because I know like obviously.

682
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,840
That made them feel bad when they see.

683
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,620
So like that type of message is for me.

684
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,000
Because I'm like I guilt tripped.

685
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,880
A little bit from that.

686
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,980
Because I was just like I know I can't stop myself.

687
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,500
I'm crying.

688
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,400
But I understand.

689
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,460
And that's why like.

690
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,680
After that I was just like.

691
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,660
I was just like I need to take a step back.

692
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,240
I am going to have.

693
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,800
My staff member.

694
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:38,960
Um.

695
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,480
I'm going to have my staff member.

696
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
And uh.

697
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,500
And so I can take a step back.

698
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,180
And just decompress.

699
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,380
And stuff.

700
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,380
But please like I said.

00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,300
Please like appreciate.

704
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,680
Like when you see why.

705
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,280
When you see why it was delayed.

706
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,620
You guys will understand.

707
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,040
Because it was a big project.

708
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,400
There was so many things going into it.

709
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,500
Um and.

710
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,080
You'll see why.

711
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,000
It was delayed.

712
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,780
Um it was.

713
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,460
There's just a lot going on.

714
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,680
It might not be a super long stream.

715
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,520
When it comes to like what the content is in itself.

716
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,520
But a lot of effort.

717
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,200
Was put into it.

718
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,740
In general.

719
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,500
And um.

720
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,780
And you guys will see why.

721
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,280
Um and.

722
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:33,800
Um.

723
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,400
I even said like.

724
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,780
I knew like crunch time would be a factor.

725
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,740
And I even was like.

726
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,900
I'm willing to hire as many people as I can.

727
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,720
To make sure there's no like.

728
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,360
People don't actually sacrifice their health.

729
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,720
Um obviously.

730
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,040
We didn't predict how ambitious.

731
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
The project.

732
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,880
Was in the end.

733
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,680
It was incredibly ambitious.

734
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,980
And um.

735
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,120
Even with the amount of people.

736
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,380
I hired.

737
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,900
It was still.

738
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,280
Not enough people.

739
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,560
We had to do all nighters.

740
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,800
And some people was like.

741
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,940
They got sick in the middle of it.

742
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,820
But then we couldn't really do much about it.

743
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:14,540
Um.

744
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,040
And yeah.

745
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,120
Even though we hired so many people.

746
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,640
We still had to have crunch hours.

747
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,640
And crunch hours.

748
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,000
As well as people pulling all nighters and everything.

749
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,280
And so they worked incredibly hard.

750
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,060
They worked really.

751
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,680
Really really hard.

752
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,720
Um and I saw some people mention.

753
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,620
They're like oh that's like really.

754
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,440
Like emotionally intelligent.

755
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,720
To take a step back.

756
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,800
Um it's just cause in the past.

757
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,340
I've learned from my mistakes in the past.

758
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,320
Cause in the past.

759
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,740
I didn't have like.

760
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,500
The opportunity.

761
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,160
To be like.

762
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,600
I know I'm gonna be emotional.

763
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,800
So I'm gonna let someone else take over this.

764
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,860
While I take a breather.

765
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,460
Um like I never had that opportunity before.

766
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,200
But I knew that's something I needed.

767
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,660
I knew that like.

768
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,640
If I do get emotional.

769
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,140
I need somebody to step in.

770
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,620
To like be the messenger for me.

771
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,660
And I need to take a step back.

772
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,400
So it's more so like I learned from my past experiences.

773
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,340
Cause in my past.

774
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,700
It was just me.

775
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,320
If I get emotional.

776
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,600
I get emotional.

777
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,340
But now.

778
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,720
Now I have the opportunity.

779
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,140
To send someone in.

780
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,140

And when I do feel.

786
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,440

00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,760
Cause I don't want to leak.

Talking to you guys.

00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,700
Now I'm not sad.

816
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,440
No I'm sad.

817
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,480
I mean I can't be like now I'm not sad anymore.

818
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,520
Like no cause then that would be like.

819
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,320
Being like a psychopath.

820
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,320
If I just suddenly stop being sad.

821
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,520
But like you know I still.

822
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:56,820
Um.

823
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,580
And.

824
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:00,980

827
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,580
I feel a lot better.

828
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,820
I do feel a lot better.

829
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,400
Like I don't feel tears anymore.

830
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,420

831
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,140
.

832
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,160
Uh.

833
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,660
I don't.

834
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,420
I don't feel.

835
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,340
Uh.

836
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,540
I don't feel.

837
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,780
Uh.

838
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,140
Tears anymore.

839
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,280
So yeah.

840
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:33,100
I really appreciate just being able to.

841
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,740
Talk to you guys.

842
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:36,940
Um.

843
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,760
Um.

844
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,480
And.

845
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:42,780
Yeah.

846
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,940
That's why I'm saying like.

847
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,660
Please.

848
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,740
Please like.

849
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,380
Send lots of love to the project team.

850
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,640
Especially when it's revealed who's being.

851
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,080
Like who was working on what.

852
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,140
And.

853
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,020
Um.

854
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,400
Um.

855
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,960
Because I didn't know that people were pulling all nighters.

856
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,220
And the crunch time.

857
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,720
Like people were doing crunch time.

858
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
Because um.

859
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,540
I wasn't um.

860
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,060
I was just like overseeing the.

861
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,740
General thing.

862
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,260
So I wasn't aware.

863
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,200
That the team were pulling all nighters.

864
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,360
Until today.

865
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,440
And uh.

866
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,040
Cause there's a lot of messages.

867
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,720
Because I have so many things going on.

868
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Behind the scenes.

869
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,580
Not just from this project team.

870
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,080
And uh.

871
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,020
Um.

872
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,640
And I was like.

873
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,140
And I have other things.

874
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,820
And so like sometimes I don't read like all the messages.

875
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,540
That are going in on that server.

876
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,480
So I wasn't.

877
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,800
Aware that um.

878
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,280
Some of the members were pulling all nighters.

879
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,580
And stuff to make the deadline.

880
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,980
And that uh.

881
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,660
People were like.

882
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,640
People were getting like.

883
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,700
Crunching for it.

884
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,920
Because I was very open.

885
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,360
I was like I'm willing to hire as many people as possible.

886
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,420
Um.

887
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,020
To make sure to avoid that.

888
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,280
Um.

889
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,960
And uh.

890
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,080
Um.

891
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,640
And.

892
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,660
I uh.

893
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,200
So that's why I want to send like extra.

894
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,760
I want you guys to send extra love.

895
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:18,880
Uh.

896
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,520
To the team.

897
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,240
Um.

898
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,060
For tomorrow.

899
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,780
Because uh.

900
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,400
You know they worked so hard on this.

901
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:28,820
And.

902
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,780
That's why I also decided.

903
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,500
I made the executive decision.

904
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,860
To push it to tomorrow.

905
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,260
And.

906
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,860
It's just better for everybody.

907
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,420
Because I don't want it.

908
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,820
To you know.

909
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,640
If I push the stream.

910
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,280
Two to three hours.

911
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,980
And we didn't even get a chance to like look through.

912
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,940
Whatever the project was.

913
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,660
And like.

914
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,340
Just like correct it in time.

915
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
And stuff for tomorrow.

916
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:56,700
Um.

917
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,380
And everything.

918
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,400
So yeah.

919
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,980
That's really what I really want to say.

920
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,460
Again like I said I apologize.

921
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:05,960
Uh.

922
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,740
And you can't.

923
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,960
I think this is like the first time I've ever had something delayed.

924
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,600
This late.

925
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,540
I guess.

926
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,160
Like I had.

927
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,720
I uh.

928
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,360
Um.

929
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,240
I think it's like the first time I've ever.

930
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,700
Had to delay something.

931
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,320
For something like this.

932
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:24,960
Late before.

933
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,000
Uh.

934
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,500
Because usually I just.

935
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,560
Roll with it.

936
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,100
But the whole reveal centers around this.

937
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,600
So I.

938
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,000
Um.

939
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,080
Um.

940
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,540
And.

941
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,380
Usually I just roll with it.

942
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,420
And be like that's okay.

943
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,940
We'll just keep going.

944
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,700
We'll keep streaming.

945
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,380
And then when it's ready I'll just pluck it in.

946
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,400
Like plop in.

947
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,860
But the whole thing really relied on that.

948
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,200
Just like alright.

949
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,480
Tomorrow.

950
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,040
There's nothing we can do.

951
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,960
Tomorrow it is.

952
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,300
For those wondering I will not be streaming the Stranova tournament.

953
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,420
For day 2.

954
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,080
Um.

955
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,280
And.

956
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,080
Uh.

957
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,380
I saw someone say first time I had.

958
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,660
I've had delays before.

959
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,400
But I didn't realize with the scope of this project.

960
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,320
It is incredibly ambitious.

961
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,180
It is incredibly ambitious.

962
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,540
And it is in.

963
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,900
The scope of.

964
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,300
Like I said I have never paid.

965
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,380
This much amount of money.

966
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,280
To.

967
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,660
To do the thing that I wanted to do.

968
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,580
I.

969
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,680
I created.

970
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,600
There were so many things created for it.

971
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,580
That.

972
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,100
Um.

973
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,880
Was just like one time use.

974
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,340
Like.

975
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,600
Never to be used again.

976
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,200
Except for this specific thing.

977
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:55,960
And.

978
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,180
And.

979
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,520
It was incredibly ambitious.

980
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,600
The scope was it was huge.

981
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,900
I had at least.

982
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,000
20 people hired for this project guys.

983
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,780
It was at least.

984
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,040
I think it was at least 20 people.

985
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,400
That were working.

986
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,140
On this project.

987
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,320
Um.

988
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,240
If not more.

989
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,480
I'm pretty sure.

990
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,060
There was a lot.

991
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,500
I remember scrolling through the.

992
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,580
The like list of people.

993
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,720
And there was a lot of people.

994
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,640
At least 20 plus.

995
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,760
That means there could be more.

996
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:31,840
Fuck it.

997
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,360
I'm going to count it.

998
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,620
I have the credits list.

999
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,220
So I can count the credits.

1000
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:35,920
I'm like trying.

1001
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,720
Okay also like I'm like really nervous.

1002
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,800
Because I actually do have like all the stuff set up.

1003
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,120
On OBS.

1004
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,180
So like I'm trying to make sure I don't accidentally.

1005
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,520
Click on anything other.

1006
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,220
Than the chatting screen.

1007
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,140
I'm trying to be.

1008
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,580
Alright let's see.

1009
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,880
1, 2, 3, 4.

1010
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,140
Uh.

1011
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,360
Oh wait.

1012
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,400
1, 2, 3, 4.

1013
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,620
Uh.

1014
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,620
5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

1015
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,200
Uh.

1016
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,380
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

1017
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,700
17, 18, 19.

1018
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,320
20, 21.

1019
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,460
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

1020
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,040
Uh.

1021
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,720
31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37.

1022
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,440
I have 30 almost.

1023
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,280
I have 37 people.

1024
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,040
Employed on this.

1025
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:25,780
Uh.

1026
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,520
That was a lot more than 20.

1027
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,040
Um.

1028
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,360
I'm not sure.

1029
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,040
I'm not sure.

1030
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,700
I'm not sure.

1031
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:39,880
I'm not sure.

1032
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,920
I'm not sure.

1033
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,040
Um.

1034
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,920
So.

1035
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,740
Yeah.

1036
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:52,200
4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24.

1037
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,520
Yeah.

1038
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:55,860
Um.

1039
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,360
So.

1040
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,180
I.

1041
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,220
Yeah.

1042
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,180
This project that I'm doing.

1043
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,200
Was.

1044
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,760
Was very ambitious.

1045
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,700
It was.

1046
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,000
Um.

1047
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:17,800
Um.

1048
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,120
And.

1049
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:20,700
Um.

1050
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,340
And.

1051
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:23,980
Yeah.

1052
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,000
It's not.

1053
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,920
Thing is.

1054
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,140
Like I'm worried I'm hyping it way too much.

1055
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:29,520
That's.

1056
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,020
And then when you guys see it, you're like.

1057
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,340
Oh.

1058
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,360
I hope when you see it you don't go like.

1059
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:38,960
Oh.

1060
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,360
I said all that, but I'm hyping it way too much.

1061
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,400
And you'll be like, wow, I can't believe you need 37 employees for that.

1062
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,960
Not employees, sorry, contractors.

1063
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,400
I guess you can say contractors.

1064
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,560
You need 37 contractors.

1065
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,460
Really?

1066
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,980
So go in, just pretend you didn't hear how many people are hired.

1067
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,840
And just go in with low expectations chat.

1068
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,460
Just...

1069
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,660
But yeah.

1070
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,060
Anyway.

1071
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,480
What else was I...

1072
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,160
What else was I gonna say?

1073
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,680
I don't remember what my topic was.

1074
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,300
What my topic was like...

1075
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,060
Before I...

1076
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,340
Oh yeah!

1077
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,400
I'm not gonna stream Shrenova.

1078
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,760
I'm not gonna stream Shrenova tomorrow.

1079
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,240
I'll show up for Shrenova.

1080
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,300
You know, and I might have to leave before the tournament is over.

1081
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,380
So I need to tell RPR to get a sub.

1082
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,720
Just in case.

1083
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,560
Because, you know, I told...

1084
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,300
They apparently have...

1085
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,300
It's apparently like later now?

1086
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,420
The...

1087
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,260
Um...

1088
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,720
I don't know.

1089
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,200
I need to look at what time the tournament is.

1090
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,120
And...

1091
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,180
Um...

1092
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:26,860
And I need to tell RPR that there is a chance that if we do make it far, which I doubt.

1093
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,360
I think we're gonna get eliminated in the first game.

1094
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,700
We might get eliminated in the first or second game.

1095
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,740
But...

1096
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:36,820
If...

1097
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,500
Uh...

1098
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,200
If...

1099
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,500
If we do make it further than what I expected...

1100
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,820
I will drop out...

1101
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,420
At 4pm.

1102
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,080
I will 100...

1103
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,900
No, actually...

1104
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,580
Because I already have everything set up.

1105
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,940
I literally just need the project file.

1106
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,280
I need the project file and then I'm good to go.

1107
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,560
But like, I will leave at exactly 4.30.

1108
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,340
Like, I don't fucking care.

1109
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,480
I will leave at 4.30.

1110
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,660
This is much more important.

1111
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:12,780
I...

1112
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,540
Like...

1113
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,780
5K would only pay for one thing.

1114
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,560
I mean, maybe not one thing.

1115
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,040
Maybe like two to three things from the project.

1116
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,140
Like, I do not care.

1117
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,120
Sorry, JK.

1118
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,960
I was exaggerating on that.

1119
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,800
Two to three things.

1120
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,360
Maybe.

1121
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,020
Um...

1122
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,660
I don't even get 5K.

1123
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,200
Because it's split between five of us.

1124
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,440
Bro, I don't...

1125
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,120
Like, 1K?

1126
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,900
I don't even know...

1127
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,680
I don't even know like how much the prize pool really is.

1128
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,260
Like, I don't even know the prize pool...

1129
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,180
Uh...

1130
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,060
On it.

1131
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:57,940
Uh...

1132
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,280
So, I don't know.

1133
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,240
Hahaha...

1134
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,660
Um...

1135
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,780
I don't know.

1136
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,000
How much money did you spend on this?

1137
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,320
I will reveal the amount after the reveal.

1138
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,340
After the...

1139
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,700
Uh...

1140
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,380
After the reveal...

1141
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,460
I will...

1142
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,980
I will reveal it.

1143
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,560
Hahaha...

1144
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,360
Uh...

1145
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,240
Hahaha...

1146
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,500
Oh...

1147
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,060
Oh, hey!

1148
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,020
They still recognize it!

1149
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,440
Yeah...

1150
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:26,960
Yeah...

1151
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,360
I...

1152
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,580
I don't know how...

1153
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,480
I think we're gonna get eliminated after like the second game or something.

1154
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,060
Because you guys have actual Valorant players.

1155
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,640
And our PR...

1156
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,440
thought that the game was Overwatch.

1157
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,080
Uh...

1158
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,540
Haha...

1159
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,800
Was mostly Overwatch.

1160
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,620
So, he recruited zero Valorant players.

1161
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,420
Uh...

1162
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,820
Hahaha...

1163
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,480
Hahaha...

1164
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:48,700
Hahaha...

1165
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,540
Uh...

1166
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,520
No, don't tell us the cost.

1167
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,620
Okay, what if I just keep it in the members only?

1168
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,640
Hahaha...

1169
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,540
And then make everybody else have FOMO.

1170
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:01,980
Hahaha...

1171
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,140
Hahaha...

1172
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:04,180
Hahaha...

1173
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,620
Hahaha...

1174
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,140
Hahaha...

1175
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:06,400
Hahaha...

1176
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:06,620
Hahaha...

1177
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,060
You know what?

1178
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:08,760
Yeah...

1179
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,620
That's how it's gonna pay...

1180
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,980
That's how I'm gonna pay it off.

1181
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,320
I'm gonna reveal how much the...

1182
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,500
Like the general estimate of how much I spent in a member stream.

1183
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,960
So, you guys...

1184
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:27,680
If you really wanna know how much it cost me, I will reveal it in the member stream.

1185
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,020
Hahaha...

1186
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,240
Because I need to...

1187
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,020
I need to make back the amount that I spent.

1188
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:39,820
Hahaha...

1189
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,140
And yeah, I'm gonna...

1190
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:41,440
Haha...

1191
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,540
That's how...

1192
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,920
That's how they get you.

1193
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:44,760
Hahaha...

1194
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,040
That's how they get you.

1195
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,660
I feel a lot better.

1196
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,560
Uh...

1197
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,440
I honestly feel so much better just talking.

1198
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:56,200
Like I said, I really do feel like whenever I do get sad, um...

1199
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:56,840
I...

1200
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,880
Um...

1201
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,560
I love talking to you guys because it really does...

1202
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,160
Because if I done in stream, I would have cried.

1203
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:06,820
Hahaha...

1204
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,120
So much.

1205
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,800
And I would have cried.

1206
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,800
I would have been like filled with like...

1207
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,400
I guess like, you know, I would have kept everything inside.

1208
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:20,840
And I would have kept everything inside and I would have been like super...

1209
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,320
Uh...

1210
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:21,960
I would...

1211
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,100
I would just not been healthy.

1212
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,520
So, I am glad.

1213
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,800
Even though I can't really say like...

1214
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,220
Obviously say a lot of like the details of everything.

1215
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:34,400
I'm really happy that I was able to, you know, let out some of my frustrations to you guys.

1216
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:34,720
Because...

1217
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,100
Oh my god.

1218
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:35,600
I was so sad.

1219
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,180
Uh...

1220
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,140
My friends were messaging me.

1221
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:37,840
It was like, are you guys okay?

1222
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,800
I was like, no, I'm crying.

1223
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:39,780
I'm so sad.

1224
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,100
Because anybody would be sad in that scenario.

1225
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:44,800
You know?

1226
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:45,800
I...

1227
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,420
It was a lot of work.

1228
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,320
Um...

1229
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,340
I hope.

1230
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:50,580
Uh...

1231
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,600
But I really do.

1232
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,420
Uh...

1233
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,140
Uh...

1234
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,840
DarkBlade, as a member, I don't want to know how much you spent.

1235
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,080

Don't worry.

1246
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,400
Don't worry, DarkBlade.

1247
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,580
I'll say it in a member stream.

1248
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:16,440
So like, I'll give like a warning, like trigger warning.

1249
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:17,700
Uh...

1250
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,320
Trigger warning.

1251
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,240
I will reveal the amount of money I spent.

1252
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,240
Skip to X...

1253
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,060
Like pause.

1254
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,600
Look away.

1255
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:38,880
I'm sorry.

1256
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,760
I'm sorry.

1257
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,540
Oh, warning the budget.

Okay.

1263
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,680
Trigger warning.

1264
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,360
Financial irresponsibility.

1265
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,320
Making poor financial decisions.

1266
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,100
Trigger warning.

1267
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,340
Don't worry.

1268
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:14,520
I will give you guys a warning in the members for those who are like, uh, please.

1269
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,260
I don't want to.

1270
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,100
I don't want to know.

1271
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,800
Not in the port.

1272
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:23,900
No.

1273
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:26,800
Um...

1274
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,500
Oh, what else do I want to talk about?

1275
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,500
Um...

1276
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,020
I'm really excited though for my birthday.

1277
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,320
For those who don't know, I'm really excited for my birthday.

1278
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:38,520
I don't know.

1279
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,140
One of my five birthdays.

1280
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:44,320
God, sometimes I don't even remember the fucking shit I write sometimes.

1281
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:45,360
Uh...

1282
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:54,480
But my real birthday, the very real birthday is July 4th.

1283
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,260
And I'm super excited.

1284
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,820
I'm really, really excited for July 4th.

1285
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,560

Are happening in July.

1288
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,320
I'm really excited.

1289
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:08,820
Um...

1290
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,300
It's crazy.

1291
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,100
An entire country is celebrating my birthday.

1292
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,060
Because I...

1293
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,140
I showed up first.

1294
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:16,620
Uh...

1295
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:22,080
I showed up first.

1296
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,060
And anyway.

1297
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:23,980
Um...

1298
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,560
But yes!

1299
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:25,560
Um...

1300
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,760
July 4th is going to be a very, very special day.

1301
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:33,100
Not just July 4th, but like the general month of July.

1302
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,080
There's like a lot of things.

1303
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,300
There's like a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of things.

1304
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:44,640
There's a lot of stuff coming up in July that's been in the works for a while.

1305
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,300
Some of these things might be announced tomorrow.

1306
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,540
Uh...

1307
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,780
Um...

1308
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,660
And it might be announced tomorrow.

But there's like multiple stuff going on that I'm really excited for you guys to hear about.

1310
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,060
Um...

And...

1312
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,260
Um...

1313
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:06,740
It's...

1314
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,540
It's a lot.

1315
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,020

1316
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:08,080

00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:08,640
Awesome.

1318
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,920
Being in India is so hard.

1319
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:12,420
Ahaha...

1320
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,060
Um...

1321
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:17,800
Being...

1322
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,920
Being in India is so hard, guys.

1323
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,100
Oh my God.

1324
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:24,440
Thank you.

1325
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,780

00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,880
Amelia, thank you for the Akka Suppa.

1330
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,380
I'm sorry if I haven't thanked the other Akka Suppas yet.

1331
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,760
I mean, like when you guys were super chatting, I was having a really deep conversation.

1332
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,000
But yeah.

1333
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,040

1335
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,380
I trust you to deliver something amazing like you always did.

1336
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,880
LV, okay, don't let something like this stop you.

1337
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,660
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1338
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,440
Thank you, thank you.

1339
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,080
I really, I really, really, really appreciate it.

1340
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,080
I think it's also because like...

1341
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,040
Um...

1342
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,600
Um...

1343
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:53,460
I...

1344
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:54,460
Really...

1345
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:55,420
Um...

1346
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,200
I really appreciate everybody for showing up.

1347
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:02,100
And I really apologize if like, you know, tomorrow for some people would be Monday.

1348
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:02,900
They have to go to work.

1349
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,940
And for some, they like cleared up their schedule today.

1350
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,640
So they might not have a clear schedule for tomorrow.

1351
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,800
But no matter what, I really appreciate you guys for supporting me.

1352
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,740
And for showing up if you do show up.

1353
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,100
And just enjoying the ride.

1354
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,340
Um... and everything.

1355
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,460
Because being in D is so difficult.

1356
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,840
Oh my god.

1357
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,700
It is so much work.

1358
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,640
Burrito, thank you for the Akasupa!

1359
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,720
Thank you, thank you.

1360
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,720
Remember, even if you're disappointed for today's welcome for you and not the skin.

1361
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,420
So thank you, thank you for the Akasupa!

1362
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,940
Thank you, thank you.

1363
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,860
I really...

1364
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,420
I really appreciate it guys.

1365
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,460
Like I said, tomorrow when the project team reveals itself.

1366
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:43,120
I want you guys to give them lots and lots of love.

1367
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:48,800
Because they did work incredibly hard to make this a reality.

1368
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:54,300
So I really, really, really want you guys to give them lots of love and support.

1369
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:01,800
Because I know if I feel terrible, like they must be feeling like equally not just as bad.

1370
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,100
And they deserve a lot of love too.

1371
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,280
And...

1372
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:07,960
And...

1373
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,160
And...

1374
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,760
What else...

1375
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,680
What else did I want to talk about?

1376
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:16,640
I don't...

1377
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,540
Oh my gosh, there's...

1378
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:17,960
Oh!

1379
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,020
Next week!

1380
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:19,860
Next week?

1381
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,960
Oh my gosh.

1382
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:21,840
Super hype.

1383
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:28,900
But next week, Hiro invited me to try out Pal World Early Access.

1384
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:34,420
She got invited to do an Early Access Pal World two days before.

1385
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:42,020
Two days before the release date of the update.

1386
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,920
So like I'll be checking out like she has a server for it and everything.

1387
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,000
And I'll be checking it out next week.

1388
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:48,640
Yeah!

1389
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:53,460
We're gonna have early access to the new update of Pal World!

1390
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:54,580
Yeah!

1391
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,820
That's really all I have planned for next week to be fair.

1392
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,700
And also we finished Sand Land.

1393
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,920
And we fucking finally finished it.

1394
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,900
We finally finished Sand Land so we can play another.

1395
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,680
So we can finally start a new series.

1396
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:16,500
Yeah!

1397
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,240
And...

1398
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,080
Oh my gosh.

1399
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:21,700
What else?

1400
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:22,460
What else?

1401
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,540
I don't actually know.

1402
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,320
I'm trying to think about like...

1403
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,840
I wrote down some stuff I want to talk about.

1404
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:32,680
But a lot of these things I want to talk about is usually like...

1405
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:33,960
Fuck.

1406
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:34,520
It's like...

1407
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,280
It's basically...

1408
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,140
It's like...

1409
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:39,340
Stuff regarding the new skin suit.

1410
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:39,800
So...

1411
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,540
So it's like...

1412
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,380
Oh man all these things I signed up for.

1413
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,860
Like I wrote down it's for the new skin suit.

1414
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,320
So like I can't talk about that yet.

1415
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:53,900
Um...

1416
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,560
Let's see.

1417
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,100
Let's see.

1418
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:00,760

1422
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,800
Okay I really want to tell you guys this.

1423
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,300

It made me feel so happy.

1439
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,740
But they were telling me...

1440
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,260
Because like...

1441
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,160

1499
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,080

1508
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,360
Like the last week or something before.

I was so happy.

1512
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:05,800
To find out that...

1513
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,760

00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,820
But it was for like...

1531
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:28,280
It was...

1532
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,400
It's related to gaming.

1533
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,860
And basically like...

1534
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,500

1537
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,820

1545
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,880

Um...

1547
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,300
I was like...

1548
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:51,580
Yeah!

1549
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,160
Of course!

1550
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:52,920
I was so surprised!

1551
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,360
I was so...

1552
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,140
It's not Hyatt.

1553
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:55,700
I'll just say.

1554
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,100
Because like...

1555
00:53:59,100 --> 00:53:59,740

1556
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,000
I know like Hyatt...

1557
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:01,620
Like I...

1558
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,380
Hyatt was also like...

1559
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,000
Um...

1560
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:05,820
A...

1561
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:06,640
Um...

00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,360
Like a big fan too.

1563
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,540
And I really appreciate the support they give me.

1564
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,360
But there was a different sponsor.

1565
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:12,900
It's not...

1566
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:13,900
Hasn't been revealed yet.

1567
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,060
The sponsor hasn't been revealed yet by the way.

1568
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:17,880
Um...

1569
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,580
So that's what...

1570
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:18,940
If you're like...

1571
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,440
Oh it's Hyatt.

1572
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:19,760
It's not.

1573
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:23,680
But I...

1574
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,320
It was just...

1575
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,260
It was just so sweet.

1576
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,340
It was really, really sweet.

1577
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,440
And they were just like...

1578
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,340
Oh can we like send this to you?

1579
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:31,440
And like...

1580
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,940
Like because they were sending me other stuff regarding like the sponsorship.

1581
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,260
So they're like...

1582
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,020
Can we like send this to you?

1583
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:37,680
And like...

1584
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,660
Like because like one of our workers is like a huge fan of you.

1585
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,300
And like could you like autograph it?

1586
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:42,920
And then like...

1587
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,320
Uh send it back to us.

1588
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,520
I was like oh yes of course.

1589
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,020
Of course.

1590
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,660
Like uh I remember like um...

1591
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,440
Uh one of my staff members was like...

1592
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,840
Like was gonna be like...

1593
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,740
You could say that they told me about it.

1594
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,200
And then they're like you could say these things.

1595
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,720
The first one was like normally you'd be like...

1596
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,660
The first one was like...

1597
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,960
Oh she normally doesn't autograph these things.

1598
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,120
Like it has to be paid.

1599
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,260
You know like meet and greet.

1600
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,560
Some stuff or like store items.

1601
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,360
Or the second option would be like...

1602
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,380
Yes we'll make an exception.

1603
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,400
And I was like no make an exception.

1604
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,080
Like I thought it was really sweet.

1605
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,600
Like I don't want them to like...

1606
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,300
I don't want them to be like...

1607
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,020
Uh like reject that.

1608
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,700
I just thought it was incredibly sweet.

1609
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:28,130
I mean they're giving me money anyway.

1610
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:34,130
They're...

1611
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,310
They were...

1612
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:36,190
They're giving me...

1613
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:39,410
Money anyway for the uh...

1614
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:40,530
For like...

1615
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:41,370
For the sponsors.

1616
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:42,970
So like I don't really care.

1617
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:49,970
Sorry thank you for the Akasupa.

1618
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:50,550
Thank you.

1619
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:53,350
Sometimes things won't go in the way we want it.

1620
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:54,510
So we must blame Canada.

1621
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:55,950
Yeah f**king Canada.

1622
00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:00,750
I love how my skin suit is...

1623
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,950
I mean obviously it's like yeehaw cowboy themed.

1624
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:04,990
And I am Canadian.

1625
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:11,650
I had to...

1626
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:13,530
I had to like research.

1627
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:16,730
Like I had to like research like...

1628
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:18,090
Like western...

1629
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:20,610
The wild west in America.

1630
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:27,250
The Canadian cowboys.

1631
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:31,610
Yes but I'm not from the east coast.

1632
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:35,350
So I didn't know anything about like actual...

1633
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:40,250
I remember I was like researching.

1634
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:41,690
Because like the Adithya.

1635
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:44,950
The bounty hunter...

1636
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:46,330
Uh...

1637
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,130
Cowboy stuff.

1638
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:51,190
Was given by uh...

1639
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:52,450
Uh...

1640
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,350
Was given by my...

1641
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:55,630
My new mama.

1642
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:57,830
And it was like...

1643
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:00,290
You know I thought it was a very creative idea.

1644
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:02,970
And when you see it you'll understand.

1645
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:04,990
I thought it was pretty creative.

1646
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:06,070
Um...

1647
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:09,030
Because like I wanted something more...

1648
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:11,370
I guess like you know...

1649
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:12,550
Pew pew pew pew.

1650
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,410
But I hate tech work.

1651
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:23,050
I was like I'm fucking tired of all like...

1652
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:28,190
Like Vtuber designs that are like based off of...

1653
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:28,830
Um...

1654
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:30,090
Like you know...

1655
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:30,990
Pew pew pew pew.

1656
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:32,750
But it's tech wear.

1657
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:34,630
It's always tech wear.

1658
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:36,050
I know.

1659
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:36,610
I am tired.

1660
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:38,070
I don't like tech wear.

1661
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:38,570
I'm sorry.

1662
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:40,330
I'm...

1663
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:41,290
I'm...

1664
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:42,470
I'm...

1665
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:43,730
So I was like yee-haw.

1666
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:45,570
And then my mama was like...

1667
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,350
I don't know how to...

1668
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:47,750
I...

1669
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:48,870
My mama was like...

1670
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,230
It's mostly tech wear.

1671
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:54,150
But we could make it cowboy.

1672
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:55,430
And I was like...

1673
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,670
Oh my god.

1674
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:58,350
That is so smart.

1675
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,370
That is so clever.

1676
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:01,810
Um...

1677
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:03,530
I just think tech wear is like...

1678
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:04,590
Um...

1679
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:05,190
Very...

1680
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,590
Like it's like a bit overdone now.

1681
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:08,990
I won't say very overdone.

1682
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:12,210
But I feel like tech wear...

1683
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:18,050
Like Vtuber designs has been like pretty sort of overdone now.

1684
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:20,830
And like it follows the same trope.

1685
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,890
Like the jacket thing.

1686
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:23,930
So like I feel like...

1687
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:26,290
And I don't want to follow the status quo.

1688
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:30,670
I didn't want to follow the status quo of like...

1689
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:31,510
Uh...

1690
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:32,390
Uh...

1691
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:33,130
You know...

1692
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:34,390
You know what I'm talking about.

1693
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:35,350
The tech wear jacket.

1694
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:40,590
You know exactly what I'm talking about when I say tech wear jacket.

1695
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:41,450
Yes.

1696
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:42,330
But it's like...

1697
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:43,470
It's always...

1698
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:45,490
It always shows up.

1699
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:52,550
I'm tired of that jacket.

1700
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:55,010
I'm tired of seeing that jacket.

1701
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:00,810
Yeah.

1702
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:01,870
The...

1703
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:02,470
The arc...

1704
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:02,730
Yes!

1705
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,190
The arc knight's jacket.

1706
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:04,570
Yes.

1707
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:05,710
That's so true.

1708
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:06,630
The...

1709
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:07,890
The arc knight jacket.

1710
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:08,310
Yeah.

1711
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:09,470
That's why I was like...

1712
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:10,390
I don't want...

1713
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:10,670
I...

1714
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:11,570
I was like...

1715
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:12,350
Yeehaw time.

1716
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:13,810
It's cowboy time.

1717
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:19,050
It's time for the cowboy!

1718
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:23,090
Because I want to pew pew pew pew pew.

1719
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:28,710
I want...

1720
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:30,990
I want to pew pew pew pew pew.

1721
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:32,490
But not be tech wear.

1722
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:36,270
Um...

1723
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:38,110
Anyway...

1724
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:38,370
Uh...

1725
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,210
Pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew.

1726
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:40,730
What else?

1727
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:42,990
What else?

1728
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:44,150
Uh...

1729
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:45,810
That I want to...

1730
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:47,070
Uh...

1731
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,050
What else do I want to talk about?

1732
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:50,530
Um...

1733
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:50,890
Oh!

1734
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:54,550
Someone asked me any news on the gamersubs cup.

1735
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:55,390
Um...

1736
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:57,150
We...

1737
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:58,090
It was a lot.

1738
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:00,050
We received...

1739
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,950
More than a thousand entries.

1740
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:04,190
I...

1741
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:06,110
I feel really bad for my assistant.

1742
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,330
Because I was like...

1743
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:08,690
Uh...

1744
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,190
Our staff team was like...

1745
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,090
Assistant...

1746
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:11,730
My personal assistant.

1747
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,490
You will...

1748
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:14,470
Uh...

1749
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:17,870
Go through the process of...

1750
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:18,530
Um...

1751
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,650
Like filtering out what was eligible.

1752
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:22,870
Uh...

1753
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,570
Until we were at...

1754
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:25,750
Um...

1755
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:26,790
What was it?

1756
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:28,410
300?

1757
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:29,710
Hahaha!

1758
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:31,850
I'm sorry.

1759
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:32,930
I haven't looked through it.

1760
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:34,350
I looked at it like...

1761
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:34,810
Twice.

1762
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:38,790
Because even I was getting overwhelmed after it got filtered.

1763
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:39,630
Uh...

1764
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:39,970
Hahaha!

1765
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:41,610
After the submissions...

1766
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:42,290
Uh...

1767
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:43,210
Got filtered.

1768
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:44,750
But it took a while.

1769
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:46,090
Um...

1770
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:46,690
They...

1771
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:50,050
Went from a thousand plus submissions...

1772
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:51,210
To like...

1773
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:52,350
I think 300?

1774
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,630
I need to check it again.

1775
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:55,830
Um...

1776
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:56,510
But...

1777
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:58,370
Um...

1778
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:02,070
And it took like a couple of weeks to really...

1779
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:02,870
I think it took like...

1780
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:04,090
Two to three weeks.

1781
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:05,990
To fully like...

1782
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:06,650
Uh...

1783
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:10,270
Go through all the submissions to see like which one...

1784
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:10,830
Like...

1785
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:14,050
Which one will be approved for me to look at.

1786
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:14,990
Uh...

1787
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:16,130
They're all so good.

1788
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:17,290
I saw the...

1789
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:20,950
The final list of submissions that I'll be looking at.

1790
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,850
To choose top 20.

1791
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:26,230
And they're all so fucking good.

1792
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,410
It's so...

1793
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:28,050
It...

1794
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:28,690
I'm...

1795
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:30,730
It's so difficult to pick.

1796
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:31,550
Hahaha!

1797
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:32,410
Hahaha!

1798
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:32,710
Hahaha!

1799
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:36,310
There's tw- I have to pick 20 submissions.

1800
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:37,630
And like...

1801
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:38,770
Even like the...

1802
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:39,970
The filtered list.

1803
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:43,390
It is incredibly difficult to pick.

1804
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:44,090
I...

1805
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:45,970
Looked at it like once or twice.

1806
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:47,110
And I was like...

1807
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:49,050
I'm gonna save this for another day.

1808
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:52,850
My focus is gonna be on something else now.

1809
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:53,570
Hahaha!

1810
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:58,690
There's also the thing about how hard it is to be an indie.

1811
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,590
Because it's like...

1812
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:01,530
Oh my god.

1813
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:02,270
Oh!

1814
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:05,890
There's so many decisions I have to make now.

1815
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:07,070
Hahaha!

1816
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,780
I was like...

1817
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:14,420
Will you ever...

1818
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:16,520
Will you ever be corporate again?

1819
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,400
Only if I get a really good offer.

1820
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,200
Hahaha!

1821
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:24,300
Like...

1822
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,720
Because it's like...

1823
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:28,100
It's like...

1824
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,300
I get to keep...

1825
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:30,260
Okay, not all.

1826
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:32,520
I get to keep like a hundred percent.

1827
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:34,340
Like...

1828
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:34,420
Like...

1829
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,200
Of my profits.

1830
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,200
And the thing is though...

1831
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,260
Like...

1832
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:39,860
Uh...

1833
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,720
It's like...

1834
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,300
The thing is like...

1835
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,400
Yeah, it's a lot hard...

1836
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,880
It's a lot harder.

1837
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,640
Uh...

1838
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,900
It's a lot harder to be an indie because there's so many more decisions.

1839
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,140
But like...

1840
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:57,360
Why join a company when I...

1841
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:57,900
When...

1842
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:58,860
Like...

1843
01:02:58,860 --> 01:02:59,360
I...

1844
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,880
A lot of stuff that...

1845
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,740
Like...

1846
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,360
Um...

1847
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,220
That I'm doing already.

1848
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:04,400
I'll still be doing it.

1849
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,300
Like...

1850
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:08,600
Like...

1851
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,080
Like...

1852
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:17,300
I feel like the biggest benefit for me is just the fact.

1853
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:18,680
So like that's what I'm saying.

1854
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,220
If the offer is like really, really fucking good.

1855
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:22,580
Like...

1856
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:23,260
I...

1857
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:23,980
I don't know.

1858
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:24,620
Like...

1859
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:24,880
Yeah.

1860
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:25,880
Um...

1861
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:27,060
And...

1862
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,040
Um...

1863
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:29,600
What?

1864
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,320
Oh my gosh.

1865
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:31,260
What do I want to say?

1866
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,360
And it's just...

1867
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,360
It's just like...

1868
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:34,920
It...

1869
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:35,660
Uh...

1870
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,500
Like the only thing that I was like...

1871
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,520
I'm like thinking like...

1872
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,180
Oh...

1873
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,860
Like what it can offer me.

1874
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,680
It's like the fact that you know...

1875
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:43,600
Um...

1876
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,960
You have a group to be with type deal.

1877
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:51,800
Like setting up collabs is one of the hardest things about being into indie.

1878
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,600
Because you know you have to...

1879
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:57,260
It's easier to just be like at everybody who wants to play.

1880
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,980
But as an indie you...

1881
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,040
You can't add everybody.

1882
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,800
You have to actually hit up people and reach out.

1883
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:03,900
It's like I really want to play this game.

1884
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:04,900
Are you like down for it?

1885
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:05,620
And stuff like that.

1886
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,460
And so there's not literally like an established uh...

1887
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:11,940
Group that you like established like...

1888
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:15,400
Set of people that you can just like be in at everybody.

1889
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:16,920
And just be like...

1890
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:17,980
Let's play this game.

1891
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:19,480
Who wants to join in?

1892
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:27,080
Um...

1893
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,600
And um...

1894
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,160
That's like...

1895
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,480
I think like one of my um...

1896
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,400
Biggest...

1897
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,640
Like oh like thing that is just...

1898
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,100
It's like one of the most difficult things as an indie.

1899
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,860
And um...

1900
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:41,280
Obviously like...

1901
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:42,780
Um...

1902
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:44,860
Like I said I didn't want to overlap.

1903
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:48,340
Because I knew like you know I'm just me.

1904
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:57,980
I'm not gonna do some fucking David versus Goliath shit there.

1905
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:58,800
Like I...

1906
01:04:59,240 --> 01:04:59,860
I ain't...

1907
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:00,380
I don't...

1908
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:02,080
I'm not up for that.

1909
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,860
I'm just me.

1910
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,980
I'm not doing some David versus Goliath.

1911
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,840
Um...

1912
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,880
And uh...

1913
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:24,460
Obviously like I know that I was like...

1914
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,320
I'm fucking...

1915
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:25,920
I don't...

1916
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,720
David...

1917
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,320
This is alternate universe.

1918
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,040
David versus Goliath.

1919
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:32,780
David versus Goliath.

1920
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:36,060
David versus Goliath.

1921
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:36,200
David versus Goliath.

1922
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:43,140
I'm literally endearing to record this video you know.

1923
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:43,920
I mean...

1924
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:43,980
I just...

1925
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:44,080
This is...

1926
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:44,860
Overall my time...

1927
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:45,540
Guess now I passed it man.

1928
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:49,760
You can learn right now.

1929
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:49,860
I think like...

1930
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:49,940
It's...

1931
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:52,720
It's really not worth the payback.

1932
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:53,300
Cause it's too much for me.

1933
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:53,580
Just like you and I were at first.

1934
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:56,220
We were doing better then this and...

1935
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,900
It takes a lot.

1936
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,120
funded...

1937
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,160
You say that...

1938
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,760
Anyway, yeah, I feel so much better though.

1939
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,220
I really feel so much better.

1940
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:28,100
And I do hope for those who were curious who've never...

1941
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,400
Who've never like...

1942
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:39,260
Uh, were like just showing up for the first time just to watch the Skinsuit reveal that you guys will show up for tomorrow.

1943
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,760
If not, it's okay.

1944
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:43,620
I'll just keep moving forward.

1945
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:48,480
There's still so much good news, uh, going forward.

1946
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:57,540
And I know like it was a missed opportunity that, uh, I wasn't able to debut the new Skinsuit today.

1947
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,160
Um, but shit happens.

1948
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,020
It was a learning lesson for, um, all of us.

1949
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,240
And, uh, everybody involved.

1950
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,160
It was a huge learning lesson.

1951
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,700
Um, for everybody.

1952
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,260
Um, I didn't even... I was so nervous.

1953
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,160
I didn't even eat anything today.

1954
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,180
I didn't even eat lunch.

1955
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,060
Or dinner.

1956
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:19,180
Um...

1957
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:21,920
Because I was just...

1958
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:26,860
Um, I was just incredibly nervous.

1959
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,960
Um, I'm not even hungry.

1960
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,160
That's the thing.

1961
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:35,160
I wasn't even hungry because I was just, you know, I was just, you know, I was so...

1962
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,820
I was just feeling anxiety about all of this.

1963
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,860
And, uh, yes, I will eat.

1964
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:42,720
I promise.

1965
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:52,300
Uh, I promise I will, uh, I will, uh, eat, uh, um, after, after the stream.

1966
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:57,220
Um, but I really appreciate everybody for, uh, showing up today.

1967
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,040
Um, and I apologize to people in the...

1968
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:00,340
In the chat.

1969
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:03,100
You might have to go to work or go to school tomorrow.

1970
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:04,820
Because it will be Monday for you guys.

1971
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,680
And I really apologize that we weren't able to get it today.

1972
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,520
But, um, you are going to watch the VOD.

1973
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,560
I hope you do enjoy the experience.

1974
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,380
And enjoy the new look.

1975
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,380
Hey, guys!

1976
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,700
I'm going to call it a day here.

1977
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,820
I'm gonna call it a day here, everybody.

1978
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:25,040
I know I was gonna be like, oh, I'm gonna stay up til, til like 7.

01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,700
And we still have like five more minutes.

1980
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,900
But, like, I'm scared.

1981
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:30,140
I'm scared.

1982
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:37,980
I'll deal with it off stream if they didn't get the message.

1983
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:44,840
Anyway...

1984
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:46,340
Anyway...

01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,840
As always everybody...

1989
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:54,960
Stay hydrated.

1990
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,420
Poster check.

1991
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,880
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

1992
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:58,600
Stay up from me.

1993
01:08:58,620 --> 01:08:59,140
Head to bed.

1994
01:08:59,300 --> 01:08:59,900
Because you guys...

1995
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,480
You guys deserve it!

1996
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:02,920
You guys really deserve it.

1997
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,760
Especially if you're staying up this late.

1998
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,400
For me.

1999
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:08,260
For those who are from Inu.

2000
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,660
And I know it's super early in Inu right now.

2001
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:12,680
So thank you guys.

2002
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:13,700
And I really apologize.

2003
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:14,520
I'll try...

2004
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,360
Definitely learning lesson from me.

2005
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:21,600
And I'm going to work harder to keep up with the scheduling of stuff.

2006
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:25,100
And like the projects and dates and stuff and everything.

2007
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:26,800
But yes!

2008
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:27,860
I'll see you guys next time.

2009
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:28,180

Bye!

2012
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,620

01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:34,920
Okay.

2014
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:35,640
I need to like...

2015
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,780
I need to make sure I don't accidentally...

2016
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:38,940
I'm going to put it on...

2017
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,340
Oh my gosh.

2018
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,260
Is this the right screen?

2019
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:42,340
We're going to find out.

2020
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:45,080
We're going to find out if this is the right screen.

2021
