1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:06,460
Oh, I was like, are we in the bad timeline?

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,360
Wait, what?

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,060
Wait, what?

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:13,880
Are we not live?

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,600
Wait, what?

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,220
Oh, wait, what happened?

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,760
Are we live now?

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,140
Oh, shit, we're live now.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,280
Oh, wait, what the fuck happened?

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,480
What?

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:01:01,420
like oh my god I had an entire tangent I had an entire tangent and like it was the intro was looping and everything that's so weird it actually okay um that is so weird I okay so anyway sorry I'm right now I'm trying to figure out who the fuck is Dominic and try because uh tangent wants me to invite it.

12
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,000
We figured out how to do invites on Gears of War, but then he was the one that invited me.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:07,800
No, he's not.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,340
I didn't call him yet because I'm going to roast him a little bit.

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,720
so, he invited me and then so he was the one that figured out how to do the invites, but it took us a while.

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,780
It took us like 10 to 15 minutes to figure out how to do invites.

17
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,860
And then, but then we have to restart our game because we want to change our settings.

18
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,200
I was like, alright, invite me.

19
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,360
And he was like, well, I want to be Dominic.

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,180
I'm like, who the fuck is Dominic?

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:45,180
So now I'm trying to figure out how to do the invites because he's playing on the Xbox app and I'm playing it on Steam.

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,020
So like, it's very, very tilting right now.

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,020
I'm so fucking confused.

24
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,020
So I'm trying to figure this out right now.

25
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,420
It's so weird.

26
00:01:56,680 --> 00:03:08,760
Like, when you're trying, when you're trying to, playing cross platforms on the xbox app versus uh uh xbox app versus uh steam on steam also um the reason why we're like super late also another reason why we're super late yeah he got on the game pass because it's free on the game pass but um the reason why we're super late was i just got my pc back and because i just got my pc back uh i was getting upgrades done because i was like i was really like tilted with all the lag and stuff especially like i was lagging in minecraft so i I need to like actually like look into this and so this is like basically my stress test right now um because now I have four sticks of ram and a new CPU and if you guys do not oh do I have VOD replay on oh my gosh I'm such a fucking mess right now I'm not VOD replay off I have now restricted VOD replay look I'm I'm a I'm a fucking mess right now because like uh I literally got back my PC at um 450 at 450 and I had to plug everything in and uh and um so if you

27
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:31,100
guys don't follow me I'll give I'll tell the story with tension um because he's gonna be like what the fuck um but basically what happened was that I got scammed on my CPU I bought an AMD CPU I'm rewinding and she can't stop me but yeah I bought an AMD CPU online and they gave me an Intel card

28
00:03:35,160 --> 00:04:21,880
so I had to buy another new CPU at the local at my local shop to fix the issue I can't tension invite me I can't do it I can't find you on the Microsoft shit I don't know if he's watching my stream okay I'm gonna let me see if I can do it through my Xbox app but like I don't understand I'm so confused okay invite to game is that it invite to party uh oh no that's not it how the do you do i don't use the xbox app just invite um you're not playing dominic i don't you're not playing dominic because i don't understand the the invite system

29
00:04:25,440 --> 00:05:27,930
on steam I have to invite him through the because like I can't find him through the fucking steam list all right let's see it the steam system is so confusing I don't understand okay I'll show you guys because that's like my entire friends list and and that like I have like real-life friends on my friends list I can't show you guys the friends list all right I don't understand so he's not he's not playing Dominic sucks to be him I will not understand I refuse to learn anyway my steam is linked to my xbox app but it won't show me like xbox friends for some reason I don't know why he's not picking up wait joinable joinable invite oh invite only how do I do that well I can do invite only joinable okay join up open to friends okay there you go now open to friends.

30
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:28,990

31
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,750
Hey, try to join me.

32
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,010
I opened my lobby.

33
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,990
What do you mean I'm not playing Dominic because you don't understand the advice?

34
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,390
I don't understand the system!

35
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,010
You're not all my friendless!

36
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,890
I can't!

37
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:40,950
I'm a team!

38
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,550
It doesn't really matter.

39
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,710
It doesn't really matter.

40
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,810
They're both literally the same guy.

41
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:47,870
It doesn't matter.

42
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,490
Dude, how dare you?

43
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,510
How dare you?

44
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:52,930
No!

45
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,010
They're basically beefy men with chainsaw guns.

00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,530
By the way, TTZ is Tengen.

50
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,310
Um, it's not some random person that joined.

51
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,830
I am not paying $10 to change my name.

52
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,290
Yeah, he doesn't want to pay $10 to change his name.

53
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:14,190
So TTZ is Tengen because, uh, it was linked to his Microsoft account.

54
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,850
Um, so that's why.

55
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,870
Uh, so now this is like my halo.

56
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,170
Today, yesterday, well, I bought this.

57
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:26,950
See, I bought an AMD CPU like two months ago in June, but I procrastinated in, uh, changing my CPU.

58
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,370
and I bought it off of Amazon.

59
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:37,290
I bought it online because I was like, the CPU I wanted to use was not at my local shop.

60
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,070
So I was like, I'll just order it online.

61
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,590
And I double checked it with my friends.

62
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,950
I was like, it's just the right listing.

63
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,330
And they're like, yeah, and it's from the official AMD listing.

64
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,930
And then I prime deliver it.

65
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:55,750
And then I, yesterday, I finally opened the CPU package and inside was an Intel card.

66
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:26,670
and not only was it an intel card it was an intel card from 15 years ago and it was still attached to it motherboard so it was cut out from its fucking motherboard and then people and i tweeted about it yeah inside by the way it was official packaging and everything and it was this intel card was made in Costa Rica too by the way i'll send you a photo yeah it was oh it was from Costa Rica I just saw this.

67
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,990
I just saw this.

68
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,490
Like, do you see the photo?

69
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:31,590
Yes.

70
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,550
Yeah, yeah.

71
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,890
Like, at the bottom is literally the motherboard.

72
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,310
Jesus Christ.

73
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,550
At the bottom of that card is literally the motherboard that it's attached to.

74
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:47,210
Like, for those that don't follow me on Twitter, this was, yes.

75
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:54,430
But the thing is, I didn't notice because the packaging, it was all like authentic packaging, like with the stickers and everything.

76
00:09:54,430 --> 00:11:08,630
and then i and that's how i by the user card that's how i found out that there is this scam that people pull on amazon where they order like pc parts and then they'll like use like a they return it yeah they use these heater things to remove like the packaging stuff so it doesn't look like they ripped the packaging and everything and then like they put it they they do a switcheroo with an old cpu which but mine is a fucking 15 plus year old cpu like yeah zion and intel zion on my amd amd package and and then they like return it intel yeah and then they return it and the amazon doesn't double check and because it's past the 30-day window this cpu is 999 canadian dollars by the way this is a nine it was a 999 Canadian like Canadian dollars for this cpu I can't even get a refund because is past the 30 days and then they're like and then like they're like sorry we don't make any exceptions and i'm going i'm gonna do a chargeback on them at my bank i'm gonna do a chargeback that is fucking

77
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:29,910
bullshit that's not a hundred median dollars what because because i didn't know that was this is the first time i've ever got how do you procrastinate because like i didn't have I've been busy with my PC because I was like, you know what?

78
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,590
Everything seems to be okay.

79
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,410
I don't really need to upgrade yet.

80
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,250
But then like yesterday, I did a Minecraft stream, and I was lagging during my Minecraft stream.

81
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:42,470
So I was like, okay, I should do my upgrades now because I'm actually lagging.

82
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,370
Like, I don't care when are you going to swap it.

83
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:52,610
It's just that you really not have the urge to open your package as soon as you're like, why do you not need that?

84
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:00,730
I don't even know how to insert my RAM because the last time I inserted my RAM I Accidentally fried my RAM

85
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:19,530
So I never and then and then the second and then when I went to get new RAM the person sold me faulty RAM So then I so then I and the third time I get to go back to the shop at the fucking I just lugged my PC to them I like you insert this RAM.

86
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,350
I give up.

87
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:43,130
I literally I gave up at that point because I was like nothing works for me I am hyperventilating just so you know Like you don't understand I have so many issues with PC parts So like I just don't trust myself I literally just got sent a fucking intel card from Costa Rica Like

88
00:12:46,910 --> 00:13:47,770
Like how could this And then when I told people they're like Are you sure the local shop didn't like You know like your PC building didn't like do a switcher rose like no i literally opened this from my package and this was the card like like how i and like one of my friends was like i've never seen that happen before this is the first time i've ever seen someone got scammed online like got scammed for a pc part yeah oh i'll probably get bad from you should check your packages bro i probably get bad from amazon if I do a chargeback it's not what they're oh my god I can't even do that is unrelatable because we don't have Amazon they get to keep $900 from me but those who are like you got scammed because it was nine no because the retail price for the AMD I don't know 9,000

89
00:13:47,770 --> 00:14:20,150
whatever the fuck it's called is like around that price I don't even remember what it was called and I had prime on it so it gave me like a slight discount um I don't yeah but like it was like a it's a beefy fuck CPU um but apparently so like what I imagine so it's it's 900 bucks yeah what I found out was that they uh they basically like uh it's in a warehouse and they just merge all the merge all the like uh package like they put return the package doesn't seem like it's open after it's return,

90
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,830
you just ship it to new customers.

91
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,970
That's so fucked up.

92
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,390
I was like, I can't believe.

93
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,110
That's fucked up.

94
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,130
Yeah, I can't believe they would do that.

95
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,130
They would just, because they're like, oh, it's not open.

96
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,270
It's not open, so it's basically new.

97
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,690
It's basically new.

98
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,630
It's not open.

99
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,970
Also, are any of my mods alive?

100
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,230
I was like, sound check, and none of my mods responded.

101
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,390
I don't know if my mods are alive.

102
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,670
Also, give me a sec.

103
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,190
I want to grab a drink real quick, Tension.

104
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,270
Oh, God.

105
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,030
Yeah.

106
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,590
Oh my god, what the fuck?

107
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:56,830
Oh god.

108
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,410

109
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,610

Oh god, what the fuck?

111
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:27,990
Ugh!

112
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,220
I have never ordered anything from Amazon because I don't...

113
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,640
We don't have Amazon here.

114
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,000
So...

115
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,640
Yeah.

116
00:15:43,240 --> 00:16:58,980
about return policy no return policy it's like 30 days so i because i i got it i got in june and it's all almost the end of the august so it's because like the thing here about packages oh yeah here you get tax i always open it i always open it because i don't trust the delivery process yeah the traffic in indonesia is as dangerous as it can get because one time i like like a motherboard a cpu and a ram and this is like a fucking instant courier type shit this is like um we get like food delivered with a person on a motorcycle basically right yeah but you can yeah but you can do that shit for like items as well so they will personally deliver those items to you the way it's like uber eats basically so it's literally within hours and one time i ordered that shit my guy fucking crashed what i lost contact in a guy for like a good eight hours where the is this guy because it is a guarantee that the package will arrive within three hours and thank god nothing happened to the package but

120
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,180

00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,880
It's crazy.

125
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,620
He's, no, he's not crushed.

126
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,520
He crashed.

127
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,660
No, he got, he crashed.

128
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,740
It was like a car crash or something.

129
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,200
The accident.

130
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,340
It's, it's, it's a motorcycle accident.

131
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,520
It happens every two hours here, probably.

132
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,540
Minor ones.

148
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,840
You paid for your AMD.

149
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,120
Well, you got an Intel.

150
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,940
Yeah, the fact that I got an Intel card is so...

151
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,220
For 15 years ago.

152
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,300
Damn.

153
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,740
Yeah, now I...

154
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,280
The fact that it's still on the motherboard is crazy.

155
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,260
Yeah, it literally was attached.

156
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,380
They literally just cut it out of the motherboard.

157
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,300
And then people in my...

158
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,400
In my...

159
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,580
When I tweeted it out, people were like, yeah, they don't...

160
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,800
You can't even get this.

161
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,360
You can't even get that anymore.

162
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,280
You have to, like, order it off of eBay.

163
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,540
of it's still attached to a motherboard to even get this processor.

164
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,180
Like, this is like, what?

165
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah.

166
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,920
And they're like, yeah, it's not even sold publicly.

167
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,060
It's literally a workstation card.

168
00:19:53,380 --> 00:20:01,220
Like, I don't have no idea how to fuck this person you have access to it, but it's not even sold to, this card isn't even sold to a, it's not even sold to the public.

169
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,480
Someone's like, sell it to a collector.

170
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,200
It's worth $20.

171
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,840
It's, the card is worth $20.

172
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,280
Like, I can't even do anything.

173
00:20:11,300 --> 00:21:24,220
anything with it uh i gotta wait another 50 years before i can sell this card before it's literally worth anything i gotta wait auction that a cpu yeah i gotta wait 50 years or it's not even a card it's a processor yeah your processor just signed it auction it all put it somewhere don't keep her signed yeah i'll just sign it's worth it's i mean it's useless all right sound guys everything okay now everything all right how is my end yeah is tension does tension sound okay now he wasn't drowning me out during story time right the next joki charity auction the cpu she was scammed with that works honestly i'll just yeah i can sign in the back on the fucking motherboard at the back i'm pretty sure you can't even do anything with it because it's it's literally like just like attached to the motherboard like i don't know even know if you can use it for anything uh i mean if they cut it out of the motherboard that means it's in a locked state and they didn't even bother to unlock the cpu so

174
00:21:24,220 --> 00:22:31,060
i'm pretty sure they did it so it'll weigh more i'm pretty sure so so like it'll weigh like the same as like the original cpu yeah that's actually crazy okay do i do like you're you invited me so you're the one the campaign right i don't know okay host co-op i don't want to be dumb well too bad you're not gonna be dumb i don't know how to use the i don't know how to use the invite no can you can you host the campaign i literally i can't because you're the leader no no i really cannot no i really did i tried i tried you can only access this access give me the squad leader give me squad leader but it just hold on give me squad leader you have the crowd just say it's mute block use your property i guess i'm sorry man i can't buy the game on steam oh my god i don't know how to i don't know how to add people i tried it just give me all right all right let's let's start all right see i hope we they gave us a selection i hope okay yeah what difficulty uh well we're not we're sort of gamers so

175
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:39,840
like easy maybe there's casual normal hardcore and I feel like we can do hardcore.

176
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,880
Like, we both play video games.

177
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,340
So I feel like we can do hardcore.

178
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Alright.

179
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,080
Alright.

180
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,060
Okay.

181
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,840
Hardcore.

182
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,860
Creating match.

183
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,540
Are you fucking doubting yourself?

184
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,440
Are you scared?

185
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,440
I... Yeah.

186
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,920
You used to be a pro player and you're scared.

187
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,880
What happened to you, man?

188
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,160
What the fuck happened to you?

189
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,920
I'm lost.

190
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,360
Bro, you...

191
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,100
What?

192
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,040
Weren't you just in a tournament like last week or some shit?

193
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,020
Oh, yeah!

194
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,540
Yeah, fucking I'm washed.

195
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,560
Why is the game so loud on my end?

196
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,620
Holy shit!

197
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,320
Wow, seriously.

198
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,600
Alright, oh, wait, these graphics look good.

199
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,860
Oh, you fart.

200
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,460
Oh, my God, it's so loud.

201
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,520
I'm turning this game down.

202
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,060
It is.

203
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,380
Why is the cutscene not toned down?

204
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,480
My ears.

205
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,520
Oh, there's...

206
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,620
Oh, hey, that's dumb.

207
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,400
All right.

208
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,540
What are you doing here?

209
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,820
Getting you out.

210
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,580
Oh, so that's Dom.

211
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,780
That's the guy you want to be?

212
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:51,760
Yes.

213
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,620
What's wrong with Marcus?

214
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,000
He seems pretty cool.

215
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,820
I just can't unhear Jake from Adventure Time whenever he talks.

216
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,220
Oh, yeah.

217
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,880
Wait, I want to be Jake.

218
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,220
That's what I'm saying.

219
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,580
I want to be Jake.

220
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
That's what I'm saying!

221
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,860
Oh, the game audio is low.

222
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,760
Okay, give me a sec.

223
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,520
Holy shit.

224
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,320
Dude, my audio is on too.

225
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,760
Everything is so loud.

226
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,300
It sounds so loud, though, for me.

227
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,440
Alright, let's see.

228
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,000
I need a...

229
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,140
Okay, keyboard and mouse.

230
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,680
I'm using keyboard and mouse, by the way.

231
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,220
There's nothing.

232
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,860
Okay, let's see.

233
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,480
Cutscene volume.

234
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,940
Nothing like that off the sort.

235
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,520
I think cutscene volume has to be just like...

236
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,380
It has to be just like...

237
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,220
What was it?

238
00:24:38,440 --> 00:25:58,560

240
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,600
Also, I need to, wait, let me up the volume a little bit more for my game.

241
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:12,220
Alright.

242
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:13,580
Alright.

243
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,380
We gotta train.

244
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,600
We, I don't know how to play this game.

245
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,320
We gotta go train.

246
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:17,540
Alright.

247
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,640
Training it is.

248
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,340
I gotta work out the kinks.

249
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,720
That's good, man.

250
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,440
That's crazy.

251
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,460
Wait.

252
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,420
Wait, don't listen to sound like Jake.

253
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,700
I wanna be Jake!

254
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,540
It's not fair!

255
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,580
Wait a minute.

256
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,980
I thought I was Jake.

257
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,540
No, I'm Jake.

258
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,780
That's why I'm on free.

259
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,080
That's why I want to be dumb.

260
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,840
Like, I don't want to be Jake.

261
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,800
I don't want to be Jake.

262
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,260
He's so...

263
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,160
That's literally Bender from Futurama.

264
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,260
Yeah.

265
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,320
All right.

266
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,860
I, uh, I'm up the volume.

267
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,220
Huh.

268
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,420
Huh.

269
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,220
Man, who I was here to get you?

270
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,840
I'd be in some deep shit.

271
00:26:59,400 --> 00:26:59,740
Come on.

272
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,180
Let's go.

273
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:00,960
All right.

274
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
I can't believe it.

275
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,940
He gets to be Jake and the main character.

276
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,420
What's the shift, dude?

277
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,000
Team still feels well.

278
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,580
Okay, don't worry.

279
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,780
I'll up the volume again.

280
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,600
All right.

281
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,040
I should up the brightness.

282
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,860
Give me a sec.

283
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:15,380
Oh, yeah.

284
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,960
No, I up the brightness a little bit too.

285
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,240
It's so dark.

286
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,160
Oh, my God.

287
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:19,860
Why is it there?

288
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:20,960
All right.

289
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,340
I up the volume again.

290
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,440
I swear to God, if I have to restart for the fucking brightness.

291
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,640
I swear to God.

292
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,540
That is so washed.

293
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:28,580
All right.

294
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,260
Oh, no, it's just my OBS.

295
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,540
Give me a sec, guys.

296
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,620
Oh, it's just...

297
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,140
Are you playing through your OBS?

298
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,060
Like, what the fuck?

299
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,660
No, there's a color correction on my OBS.

300
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,340
in case if things are too dark.

301
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,020
Alright, there you go.

302
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,380
Okay.

303
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:45,900
Alright.

304
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,060
Oops.

305
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,840
I forgot there's limited ammo.

306
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,780
Alright, where do we go?

307
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,440
Oh, fuck.

308
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,520
I forgot the reload.

309
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,900
I forgot the reload QTE.

310
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,260
Wait, there's a reload QTE?

311
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

312
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:01,920
Reload.

313
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,320
Oh, I see it.

314
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:03,860
Yeah, yeah.

315
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,120
Reload.

316
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,080
Okay, where do we go?

317
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,240
I think this way?

318
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,400
I don't know.

319
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,960
I wasn't paying attention!

320
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,960
Okay, maybe up.

321
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,120
Maybe up.

322
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:14,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

323
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,160
I was not paying attention at all.

324
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:16,780
Administration?

325
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,180
Me too, because the game is so fucking loud.

326
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,080
Yeah, yeah, see, this is the guards quarters.

327
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,560
Security door button, press it.

328
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,340
It's on the dash.

329
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,260
Press it.

330
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:27,620
Yeah.

331
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,720
Surely nothing will go wrong when you...

332
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,420
The music is so fucking loud.

333
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,160
Surely nothing will...

334
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,240
You can turn the music down.

335
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,340
It's on one!

336
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,240
What?

337
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,820
It's too thick to cut.

338
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,900
It's too thick to cut.

339
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,960
So I was like, who is he?

340
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,720
Is it her brother?

341
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,600
Yeah, my brother from Indonesia.

342
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,860
I'm her Indonesian brother.

343
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:52,420
Yeah.

344
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,880
You wanted to work out the kings?

345
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,300
This is the place to do it.

346
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,240
Yeah, I'm working out the kings, man.

347
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,760

348
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,540
Where do we go?

349
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,160
I guess we go here.

350
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,220
Wait, there's something over here.

351
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:05,980
Can I jump over?

You're dumb.

Do your job.

381
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,140

Do your job.

383
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,340
You're literally the main character.

384
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,180
Oh my God.

385
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:47,860

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:48,920
Nice.

387
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,060
What the hell's been going on in this prison?

388
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:51,620
Dude.

389
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,060
You want to know.

390
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,540
You think it's okay?

391
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,680
Insurance will cover that.

392
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,020
Yeah, insurance will cover that, right?

393
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:00,620
Don't worry.

394
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,400
We're not in America.

395
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,120
Well, I hope you don't get split open.

396
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,360
Yeah, I hope.

397
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,620
But, where do we...

398
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,380
Oh, what's this?

399
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,520
Oh, grenades.

400
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,380
How do I grab here?

401
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,280
Got them.

402
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,980
Wait, you get to hold grenades and I can't...

403
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,120
Oh, there.

404
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,780
Okay, never mind.

405
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,700
We should just grab it.

406
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,420
It didn't give me the command!

407
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,540
Okay, how do I use it?

408
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,020
Is it G?

409
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,420
It's four.

410
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,200
It's four?

411
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,420
Why the fuck is it four?

412
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,160
There's multiple...

413
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,660
Friendly fire?

414
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,520
Watch out!

415
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,980
I like how we both walked up to it and tested our life.

416
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,220
Okay, yeah, there's friendly fire.

417
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,100
Okay, okay, we know now.

418
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,680
Friendly fire.

419
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,220
We have to test it out.

420
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,060
Get a frag in there.

421
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,240
Oh my god, definitely you turned down my sense to use glass pad.

422
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,380
This glass pad is so fast.

423
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,080
We are moving your location.

424
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:03,660
Over.

425
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:30,860

It can't be news if we're playing out hardcore.

428
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,900
Oh my god, like...

429
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,700
And then someone in my chat is going to be like, yeah, but you're not playing on Insane.

430
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:15,880
Okay.

431
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,260
Oh my god, please.

432
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,200
QTE reload.

433
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,340
Come on, let me reload.

434
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,400
Okay.

435
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,840
QTE reload.

436
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,800
I passed my QTE.

437
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,980
Where is everybody?

438
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,440
Where's the others?

439
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,620
Insane is easy.

440
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,880
Yeah, they're bad.

441
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,140
This looks like an easy game.

442
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,280
It's pretty easy game.

443
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,500
Should be.

444
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,940
Can you do the QTE?

445
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,340
You think those people up top will be okay?

446
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:51,640
Yeah.

447
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,380
Probably.

448
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,620
Insurance will cover that.

449
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,320
Yeah, exactly.

450
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:55,900
Don't worry.

451
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,320
I'm pretty sure they have a good insurance policy.

452
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,260
All right.

453
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,460
I need to lower my sense.

454
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,140
I'm going to break the immersion right now.

455
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:38,480
I need a lower Wait, you can move while I'm paused But I can't when you're paused That's so fucked up But where are my rights as a player too I have no rights I actually have zero rights as the second player It's so fucked up That's why I want to be dumb I like being the second player I passed the game on insane when I was 12 Oh my god That means you're old That's the main character privileges.

456
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:40,740
Damn.

457
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,940
Oh, shit.

458
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,880
That's the point of being played.

459
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,800
Lights are over.

460
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,380
He didn't even game, someone said.

461
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,140
He has a mask.

462
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,280
That means he's gonna die.

463
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,240
That's me!

464
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,020
No, I'm Marcus.

465
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,040
Wait, I'm, oh yeah, I'm Dom.

466
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:09,560
I can't.

467
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:14,640
I keep forgetting who I am!

468
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,000
They look the same!

469
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,540
Both big rugged men!

470
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,520
Big, big rugged men.

471
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,060
They don't have hats for me to tell difference.

472
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,740
Trader like you doesn't deserve to wear the uniform.

473
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:31,600
Wait, what?

474
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,320
He's a trader?

475
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,940
He just sounds like Jake, bro.

476
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:36,940
I can't.

477
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,840
I've got good news.

478
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,840
We have a plan to end this.

479
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,420
Oh, we have a plan.

480
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,980
Oh, wait.

481
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,380
I don't have a hat.

482
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,620
Oh, that's how I tell the difference.

483
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,480
Yes, you have a beard.

484
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,760
Yeah, okay, look at the faces.

485
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,200
It's literally the same thing.

486
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,340
Oh, shit.

487
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,040
Look at this.

488
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,020
Take cover.

489
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,600
See, the girl didn't die.

490
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,460
She was too pretty.

491
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,220
Holy shit.

492
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,840
She spent too much time modeling her so she can't kill her.

493
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,120
Cutscene audio is so fucking huge.

494
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:34,940
but it can't work if we don't have the targeting data that's why we need the resonator the resonator so that we can hit those sons of where they live what's the point of yeah what's the point of wearing helmets if you're just gonna die from a headshot that's true yeah see that's why real men don't wear helmets in game guys in game in game

495
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,740
We have air support.

496
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:41,780
What?

497
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:42,900
Are you kidding?

498
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,400
You are the support, son.

499
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,460
You are the support.

500
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,220
Nemesis are keeping our birds out of the area.

501
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,120
You'll have to move in on foot.

502
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,020
We're screwed.

503
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,940
Damn right, we are.

504
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,140
The lieutenant here will be feeding you intel.

505
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:00,820
Yes, sir.

506
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,680
And the smart thing to do right now would be to leave.

507
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,000
Leave is not...

508
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,440
It's not running away.

509
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,560
It's relocating you a better position.

510
00:37:09,580 --> 00:38:09,280
relocation it's not relocation for you we're not running away we're relocating yes enemy reinforcements all right okay sound effects need to be lowered a little bit i still can't believe it doesn't pause the game when i'm playing it that one was on the house all right except get up those stairs all right let me know if this sounds better sound guys all right i'm coming over don't worry very slow don't worry I'm getting there look I have so much equipment on right now nice okay man here we go oh yeah I guess to use the chainsaw how do you how do you do that F wait it's time to play the real game where are they

Oh, I'm dying.

513
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,740
Oh, I'm dying.

514
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,280
It's like I got you.

515
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,820
Wait, where are you?

516
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,440
No.

Who?

518
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,880
Wait, that's my teammate.

519
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,640
Oh, there you are.

520
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,640
Get up.

521
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,360
Get up.

522
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:27,660
Dump.

523
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,620
Wait, no, I'm dumb.

524
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,140
Get up.

525
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,220
Your nose.

526
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,660
I'm just hanging out.

527
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,560
I can't remember.

528
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,080
I got him first.

529
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,560
Oh, you said.

530
00:38:38,560 --> 00:39:04,840
I was like, cover-based shooter we don't need cover where I come from we grab these bullets that you don't need all right time to remember remember what my sick-ass chainsaw damn whoa cover is optional exactly I did not pay $40 to go take

531
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,300
You got this game for free.

532
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,420
I guess you can do whatever the fuck you will.

533
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,040
I mean, technically it's not free.

534
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:16,980
What do you mean?

535
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,240
You got it off of the game pass.

536
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,760
Yeah, well, I still believe in the game pass.

537
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,020
Marcus, plank left.

538
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,040
Don't worry.

539
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,640
Oh, shit.

540
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,420
Oh, it's not going to stop me.

541
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,460
It's not going to stop me.

542
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,600
Holy shit.

543
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,340
You think a bullet would stop my tanky body?

544
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,560
Let's go.

545
00:39:37,680 --> 00:40:08,960

547
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,000
Why does it check the bodies when he can just do that?

548
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,980
All beeping men are good men.

549
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,060
They're not evil.

550
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,300
They're just misunderstood.

551
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,680
You're right.

552
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,000
Misunderstood Barra.

553
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:50,470
Damn.

554
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,250
Alright, where do we go?

555
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:53,550
Quick time.

556
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:57,930
Where are they?

557
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,330
Oh, that's you shooting them.

558
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,990
Go tangent, go, I believe in you.

559
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:03,830
I'm hoping.

560
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,070
Yeah, I'm sure.

561
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:10,690
Look, I'm just with the...

562
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,210
You're not even taking cover.

563
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,750
Um, taking damage instead of taking cover.

564
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,270
Is there crouch in this game or no?

565
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:18,930
No, you can walk.

566
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,790
Okay, cool.

567
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,870
Yeah, I get to use my legs.

568
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,270
Oh, oh my god, okay.

569
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,370
Oh, I got TP'd.

570
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:27,430
I was like, what the fuck?

571
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:30,530
Okay, oh, nice.

572
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,350
It's fine.

573
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:31,710
I'm dying.

574
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,170
I'm dying.

575
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,030
I'm dying.

576
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:34,430
I'm dying.

577
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:35,750
You're fine.

578
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:36,730
Just rest me.

579
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,490
Live and rest me.

580
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:40,770
Wait, I can run.

581
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:41,770
How do you run?

582
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:42,410
Where the fuck are you?

583
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:43,770
I'm here.

584
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,190
Wait, how do you run?

585
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:45,630
I know what?

586
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:45,930
You can.

587
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,130
Okay, you're just walking right into him.

588
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,210
Yeah, what the fuck?

589
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:51,850
Wait, how do you run?

590
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:53,350
Space.

591
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,730
That's the role, isn't it?

592
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:56,470
Oh, no.

593
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:57,350
It's...

594
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:57,910
Oh, what?

595
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:00,850
Okay, these controls are...

596
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:01,010
Okay.

597

I don't know.

601
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:37,930
Oh, he's right here.

602
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:39,030
Don't worry, I'll pick him up.

603
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:40,650
He's good to go.

604
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:42,230
What the fuck?

605
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,130
Oh, wait, I have no ammo.

606
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,230
Okay, it's time to use.

607
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,090
Okay, don't worry.

608
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:50,630
I got smacked to death.

609
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:51,490
Wait, are you okay?

610
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,070
Oh my god, he's right over here.

611
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:53,830
Don't worry.

612
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:54,470
I'm not okay.

613
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:55,270
Don't worry.

614
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,270
He'll eventually die.

615
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:01,270
Don't worry.

616
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:02,870
Don't worry.

617
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:03,670
There we go.

618
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:04,630
We got him!

619
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:05,630
We got him!

620
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:07,910
It took 20 years, but we...

621
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,170
Our NPCs don't res.

622
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:10,630
The AI don't res.

623
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:12,430
I failed QTE!

624
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,010
This QTE is so annoying.

625
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:16,830
Maybe you are watched.

626
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,970
How do you fail the QTE?

627
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,530
I play too much.

628
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:22,670
We are chat, maybe.

629
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:25,610
Behind us.

630
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:29,430

00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:45,130
Like, it's just... Oh, it's just darker gray or lighter gray.

640
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:46,570
That's their uniform.

641
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,050
Dude, the...

642
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:52,410
The fucking vibration is crazy in this game.

643
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,230
Are you... Wait, are you playing on your controller?

644
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:56,890

00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:12,350
Holy shit, Kim is right here.

657
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:13,230
Yeah, he is so fucked.

658
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:15,890
He's, like, literally in the middle of two locusts.

659
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:17,510
I got one.

660
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:19,950
Oh, Kim's still on his own.

661
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:20,690
What the fuck?

662
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:21,750
That's bullshit.

663
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:23,110
What is this?

664
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:23,810
A saw rifle.

665
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,450

672
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,570
You think you have the right to pick.

673
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:17,170
This is why I'm giving you the right.

674
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:19,630
Wow, you're so generous.

675
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:26,890

The locust needs to poop?

681
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:02,730
They live on the ground.

682
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,790
Yeah, why did you just poop on the ground?

683
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:06,150
Why do you need toilets for it?

684
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,010
Although I opened the door for you.

685
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:11,730
You're so kind.

686

I know.

687
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:18,330
I feel like you might as well just unplug my controller too.

688
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:18,930
We'll do it.

689
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:22,210
I just don't deserve.

690
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:25,490
I just don't deserve to play, apparently.

691
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:27,590
Okay, how the fuck do we get rid of?

697
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:16,870

You get on it.

00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,010
I'm stuck in this window.

00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:24,370
I got the window.

703
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:25,410

That was the first headshot we've ever got as a team.

708
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:06,810
What the fuck was that?

709
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:07,510
I don't know.

710
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:08,910
I think it's like in the next area.

711
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,950
Oh, it's here.

712
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:19,870
I thought it was something big, but no, it's just one guy.

713
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:21,610
You got one guy.

714
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:23,150
Like, what the fuck?

715
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:24,710
I thought it was like a big monster.

716
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,030
I know, I thought it would be a boss fight.

717
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:27,450
Wait, are there boss fights in this game?

718
00:54:29,290 --> 00:56:08,130
i don't remember yet journalists here gameplay yes you know what if we like just before for part two we just swapped the casual gameplay don't tell anyone it's like wow you guys are so good wow how did that happen we just don't tell anybody we saw the casual they'll be like wow they're gaming oh my god they're right they're breathing through the game all right you need you need ammo uh yeah i need regular ammo i'm like running out of bullets nice damn it where's that oh there's flying things now a lot of things gonna happen oh like what finding out that you're adopted oh shit i'm sorry buddy all right nice i wonder you can get like can you return a child what's their return policy yeah like what's their return policy for children because like you can return animals yeah so i was like wondering can you like return a child return an animal in fact yeah yeah i return my fish yeah when you adopt a dog you know it's just ain't right i returned my fish because it was not fit and don't be

719
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:29,710
asking for a friend okay but like i'm just curious like can you like like you know adopt not shop you know but like uh yeah i mean i don't think that that shop applies to children no key that but like i'm saying like Okay, so, you know, how many times can you return,

720
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:33,110
like, children, until they, like, ban you from the orphanage?

721
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:36,310
That's what I'm wondering.

722
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:37,070
All clear.

723
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:43,150
Until they're, like, you know, what if you're just, you're trying up different children and see which one fits?

724
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:46,710
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

725
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:50,270
No, like, trying, like, see what fits the family, you know?

726
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:51,670
Maybe the vibes don't fit.

727
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:53,390
Don't fit the family.

728
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:54,970
What do you mean?

729
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,350
I'm just curious.

730
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:58,230
First of all, that's fucked up.

731
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:01,110
You cannot return kids.

732
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:01,930
For crazy.

733
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:03,130
Exactly, for crazy.

734
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:14,490
But like in the horror movies, you know, like the one with like the orphan where there was that lady that pretended to be a child and she was like a 30 year old woman, you know, seeing how she got returned several times.

735
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:15,510
And I'm like, is that real?

736
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:19,150
Or you can just return a kid.

737
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:20,530
They just don't.

738
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:21,610
Oh, shit.

739
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:22,290
Kim.

740
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:25,170
No, that's not Kim.

741
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:26,170
What do you keep switching?

742
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:26,650
I'm home.

743
00:57:26,670 --> 00:58:19,390

744
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,150
okay I don't want to go.

745
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:28,670
Okay, I got him.

746
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,390
Oh, wow.

747
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:34,270
Doki.

748
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:35,170
Oh, yeah.

749
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:36,810
He wore a helmet and he died.

750
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:37,470
See you guys?

751
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:38,530
Helmets don't matter.

752
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:39,890
Oh, that's Kim.

753
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:44,870
So you guys wearing helmets are a mistake.

754
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:46,570
All the helmets ones die.

755
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:51,590
What's the point of wearing helmets if you just die?

756
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:53,350
True.

757
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:55,170
I mean, wow.

758
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:59,650
Don't objectify our meaty bed.

759
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,890
They have feelings, too.

760
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:05,170
Holy shit, I want to get the shotgun.

761
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,170
Wait, okay, I'm going to exchange for this area.

762
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:10,750
Okay, now I have a shotgun.

763
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:11,850
Now I can go up front.

764
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:13,030
Yeah, I got a shotgun.

765
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:13,730
Come in.

766
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:16,630
Nice.

767
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:17,750
Military equipment.

768
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:19,010
Always works.

769
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:21,150
Nice.

770
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:23,650
What the fuck is that sound?

771
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:25,590
You hear that?

772
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:26,510
Yeah, what is that?

773
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,410
Are you fucking starting a fire?

774
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:29,690
I've got the code.

775
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:33,730
No, I'm swapping my weapons just very fast.

776
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:34,050
Oh!

777
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:38,150
What the fuck?

778
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:39,310
That's so loud.

779
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:40,710
I know!

780
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:43,270
What the fuck is this?

781
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:44,650
Where are we even supposed to go?

782
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:45,230
I don't know.

783
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:46,370
I wasn't paying attention.

784
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:47,610
Search for Alpha Squad.

785
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:50,870
Oh, here it was from your fucking swap.

786
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:52,950
Can we go down?

787
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:53,850
Where is Alpha Squad?

788
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:55,490
Wait, aren't we Alpha Squad?

789
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:56,610
I thought we're the Alpha Squad.

790
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,430
No, wait, where's her?

791
00:59:59,530 --> 00:59:59,670
Whoa!

792
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:01,670
Kim did it!

793
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:09,370
I think the game was, the game got tired of us.

794
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:14,610
The game was like, please, please play.

795
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,450
Yeah, he like fucking TP'd us.

796
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,730
He was there sick and tired of us.

797
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:22,570
Alright.

798
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:24,330
It's one guy.

799
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:25,190
It's one guy?

800
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,270
Oh my god, we're gonna get one guy.

801
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:32,250
Is he a good guy?

802
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:34,530

Wait, we killed him.

807
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:48,930
The Coal Train.

808
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:52,170
There's how he says it's the Coal Train, baby.

809
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:57,690
We let him die!

810
01:00:58,650 --> 01:00:59,510

01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:01,190
Where is he?

813
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:02,750
No, he's still on his own.

814
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:04,470
Oh, he's okay!

815
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:05,490

Where's the rest of your squad?

823
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:23,410

He mused before he was cool.

840
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:26,550

What's this?

914
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:47,190
I heard they re-released Gears of War like three times, but like they never re-released Gears of War two or three.

915
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:50,670
That's true.

916
01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:53,390
How do we tell her?

917
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:55,250
What?

918
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:57,350
There's no Gears of War three?

919
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:03,630
I thought Gears of War 4 was the bad one.

920
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:05,050
Take the stairs.

921
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:08,310
Take the stairs.

922
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:09,230
That's the stairs.

923
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:10,310
I'm going down.

924
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,150
How do we take it?

925
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:15,170
Jesus Christ.

926
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:17,410
Bro, they took two shotgun bullets to the base.

927
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:20,750
Like, what's the point of having a shotgun?

928
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:24,290
They don't just fucking explode after free shot.

929
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,070
You need grenades?

930
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:27,910
No, I'm good.

931
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:28,870

932
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:29,670
I have three.

933
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:41,850
in control wait there's a gears award five we are working on that problem yeah on route to alpha's position marcus's only shit

934
01:10:48,400 --> 01:11:03,240

935
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:07,980
Hayate Otsu.

936
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:08,180
Oh.

937
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:10,560
Not the one I use.

938
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,420
I think maybe it's just ping.

939
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,840
I'm just playing on Indonesian ping.

940
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:19,880
I've been wanting to get a fucking glass fad.

941
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:21,940
I'm not used to how smooth it is.

942
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,260
I forgot that.

943
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:25,680
Yeah, no, it's Indonesian.

944
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,140
They died like two seconds later.

945
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,480
Okay, that makes more sense.

946
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:32,980
I'm playing on Indonesian ping.

947
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,280
Yeah, this is...

948
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:38,300

Yeah, you're hosting.

950
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:40,300

01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,140
Oh, yeah, I'm hosting.

953
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,780
There's only three.

954
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:45,100
There's a Gears of War 6.

955
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,180
Don't worry.

956
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,960
Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim.

957
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:49,940
Where's Kim?

958
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,160
Kim!

959
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,860
Let's go, Kim!

960
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,500
What is Kim doing?

961
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:56,340
What's Kim doing?

962
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:57,420
I thought he was going to open the door.

963
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,040
Then we can find the locust heart and rip it out.

964
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:00,840
It's the body.

965
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:02,220
The body's right there.

966
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:02,940
Go, Kim!

967
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:03,600
Oh, my God.

968
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:06,620
Are we that stupid that we can't even press a button?

969

I mean, it's very dumb of them to just walk straight into our gun.

1057
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:57,150
I mean, the music's still playing.

1058

You got, you got this, man.

1119
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:42,030
It's a little harder when there's no crosshair on this.

1120
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:47,010
Okay, I think I'm killing them.

1121
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:48,690
You think?

1122
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:49,910
I think so.

1123
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:52,090
I never think, oh, there's another gun right there.

1124
01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:52,710
Oh, you're right, sorry.

1125

01:21:09,710 --> 01:21:11,410
That's true.

1136
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:13,070

We're in the pickup zone now.

1141
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:23,570
We're out of here.

1142
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:26,990
You have a trigger finger and a punching arm.

1143
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:28,410
That's the programming.

1144
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:30,410
Yep.

1145
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:38,660

1181
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:44,320
Cut off the head of the snake and the body dies.

1182
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,960
I can't believe they killed the Rock Johnson!

1183

1185
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,880

1186
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:59,220

Don't come back, guys.

1212
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:40,600

Baird ain't moving.

1221
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:56,360
Well, unfortunately, all we got to do is get her to follow us.

1222
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:58,060
I'm scared, guys.

1223
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:59,280
Go outside the tomb.

01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:00,560
Big strong woman.

1225
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:04,120
What do you do?

1226
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:05,120
Quiet.

1227
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,520
I think he's gonna bust her head there.

1228
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:12,980
Don't worry, I'll be a hero.

1229
01:27:15,540 --> 01:27:16,860

Where is the tomb?

1238
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,480
How do we get out of here?

01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:20,440
All right.

1369
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:25,360

1478
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:15,460

01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:28,420
It was on his head.

1487
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:31,060
I have one bullet.

1488
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:32,740
One shot to make it count.

1489
01:47:33,980 --> 01:47:34,840
Make him look.

1490
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:35,900
Make him look at me.

1491
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:38,400

Totally did not, like, take five bullets or anything, right?

1502
01:47:54,940 --> 01:47:56,200

What's wrong with eating rats?

1529
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,260
Plague doesn't exist in Gears of War.

1530
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:50,420
No.

1531
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:52,800

I'll tell you if I heard anything.

1542
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:17,500
I don't want people seeing me with you, all right?

1543
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,520

01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:35,660
Wait, this is a short game.

1553
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:38,660

01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:39,300
Wait, really?

1555
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:40,800

1559
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:17,320

01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:29,500
Just turn the sound effects down.

1641
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:30,320
What the fuck?

1642
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:31,480
You know you could turn it down, right?

1643
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:33,420
Everything is at two and one.

1644
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:34,420
There's no turn.

1645
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:35,500
There's no way.

1646
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:36,200
Turn the sound effects.

1647
01:58:45,130 --> 01:58:47,490
I thought it was for that, Loki.

1648
01:58:47,810 --> 01:59:22,850
i thought they would leave i thought they would leave no they will not i thought they'd get bored all right watch out for the crew by the way thanks guys they're not attacked oh we have to do this again oh i worked so hard whoops i missed it keeps moving It's illegal We really easily you're wrong Why are they moving?

1649
01:59:23,470 --> 01:59:24,270
In what state?

1650
01:59:25,090 --> 01:59:52,990
In Dokilon Dokilon It's illegal to move when you're getting shot at You see from now on We need a life People of you aren't gonna like this Shoot the pooping tank for light That makes sense They kill us so we're doing it Okay I'm gonna show out my gun I don't think like I think maybe sniper shotgun is not the most optimal build.

1651
01:59:54,110 --> 01:59:55,630
I don't think it is.

1652
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:56,830
Yeah, I don't know.

1653
01:59:56,950 --> 01:59:59,230
Maybe I got tested out for the longer.

1654
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:02,310
I got rid of the sniper you want it.

1655
02:00:02,850 --> 02:00:03,870
Where do we go from here?

1656
02:00:04,070 --> 02:00:04,610

Oh, I got rid of my shot.

1660
02:00:08,250 --> 02:00:09,550
Let me grab my sniper again.

1661
02:00:10,930 --> 02:00:14,130
This is like one area where maybe I need the sniper.

1662
02:00:16,370 --> 02:00:17,790
It doesn't do any damage.

1663
02:00:17,810 --> 02:00:49,010

We're jamming.

1707
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:11,690
Not in a good way.

1708
02:03:11,990 --> 02:03:12,170

Every time I swear to God, oh, I see you, oh, I see you.

1721
02:03:40,510 --> 02:03:41,550
There we go.

1722
02:03:44,090 --> 02:03:47,930
Every time I shoot my gun, I look to my left just in case.

1723
02:03:48,130 --> 02:03:48,790
One dead girl.

1724
02:03:50,490 --> 02:03:51,290

1727
02:04:24,650 --> 02:04:24,790
I don't think so.

1728
02:04:24,910 --> 02:04:25,430
I'm just gonna leave.

1729
02:04:25,910 --> 02:04:26,150
Bye.

1730
02:04:26,590 --> 02:04:26,810

I'm like one bullet out, by the way.

1735
02:04:36,510 --> 02:04:36,590
All right.

1736
02:04:36,790 --> 02:04:39,050
I think we all we have to make a path again.

1737
02:04:40,390 --> 02:04:40,810
Great.

1738
02:04:41,110 --> 02:04:42,190
I just shot the lamp.

1739
02:04:44,190 --> 02:04:45,750
Maybe we should have shot the lamp.

1740
02:04:46,230 --> 02:04:48,070
Maybe that was a bad idea.

1741
02:04:48,590 --> 02:04:48,790
Wait.

1742
02:04:50,230 --> 02:04:51,550
Wait, they opened the door.

1743
02:04:52,610 --> 02:04:53,030

I need ammo.

1746
02:05:56,410 --> 02:05:57,490
Oh, we both didn't worry.

1747
02:05:57,650 --> 02:06:00,950
I have the close range and you have the long range.

1748
02:06:01,650 --> 02:06:03,930
Okay, I need you to shoot that guy because I can't do anything.

1749
02:06:04,750 --> 02:06:06,350
Yeah, I don't know the hit rate on this guy.

1750
02:06:06,590 --> 02:06:07,030
I don't know why.

1751
02:06:07,190 --> 02:06:08,370
Like, does it have to be red?

1752
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:09,470
Yeah, it has to be red.

1753
02:06:09,650 --> 02:06:11,010
Okay, that... The shooter's arm.

1754
02:06:11,290 --> 02:06:11,890
The shooter's arm.

1755
02:06:12,750 --> 02:06:13,050
Okay.

1756
02:06:13,870 --> 02:06:14,950
The shooter's arm.

1757
02:06:16,050 --> 02:06:17,330
It's all you gotta do.

1758
02:06:17,470 --> 02:06:18,810
I'm just gonna shoot his leg.

1759
02:06:19,190 --> 02:06:20,050
Just shoot his legs.

1760
02:06:20,250 --> 02:06:21,210

What the hell are we talking about?

We live.

1766
02:07:02,930 --> 02:07:04,030
Did we not live?

1767
02:07:04,790 --> 02:07:04,930
Oh.

He got fucking, didn't check your corners.

1770
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:13,830
You actually didn't check your corners.

1771
02:07:14,270 --> 02:07:14,890
You take it.

1772
02:07:14,970 --> 02:07:16,770
You got CS code.

1773
02:07:18,290 --> 02:07:19,470
No, he was in front of me.

1774
02:07:19,650 --> 02:07:20,090
He just bashed me.

1775
02:07:20,090 --> 02:07:20,530
No, no.

1776
02:07:20,710 --> 02:07:21,690
You got cams hard.

1777
02:07:21,790 --> 02:07:22,490
There's ammo here.

1778
02:07:24,070 --> 02:07:24,870
Hell yeah.

1779
02:07:25,390 --> 02:07:26,490
I don't need grenades.

1780
02:07:26,930 --> 02:07:28,030
Okay, we gotta hit your death.

1781
02:07:31,510 --> 02:07:32,590
Okay, I actually...

02:07:32,590 --> 02:07:33,230

Interesting.

02:07:35,830 --> 02:07:36,690
Can we not go down?

1785
02:07:39,750 --> 02:07:40,150
Hmm...

1786
02:07:40,150 --> 02:07:40,910
This way?

1787
02:07:41,610 --> 02:07:44,570
Is there a way?

1788
02:07:44,710 --> 02:07:45,470
No, I think it's...

1789
02:07:45,470 --> 02:07:46,470
Yeah, it's this way.

1790
02:07:46,610 --> 02:07:47,330
Oh, it's this way?

1791
02:07:49,190 --> 02:07:51,190
There's a path here, but I don't know.

1792
02:07:51,450 --> 02:07:52,850
Are we gonna make that or not?

Don't worry.

02:09:04,610 --> 02:09:05,890
Okay, I don't have ammo for this.

1802
02:09:06,110 --> 02:09:07,950
The frontal load will grow with this one.

1803
02:09:08,750 --> 02:09:10,110
It hit a bit of my load.

1804

He'll live.

1925
02:18:33,380 --> 02:18:34,980
He just won't be able to walk again.

1926
02:18:35,240 --> 02:18:35,740
That's all right.

1927
02:18:36,920 --> 02:18:36,920
Sure.

1928
02:18:37,320 --> 02:18:38,500
I'm gonna shoot him in the shin.

1929
02:18:38,900 --> 02:18:40,340
Then where's a junker?

1930
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:42,300
That's Resident Evil style, baby.

1931
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:44,860
Save ammo.

1932
02:18:45,100 --> 02:18:45,980
I didn't feel the job.

1933
02:18:47,260 --> 02:18:48,460
I figured that's your job.

1934
02:18:49,620 --> 02:18:50,560
I'm just over there.

1935
02:18:53,820 --> 02:18:55,600
We're where, old man?

1936
02:18:56,260 --> 02:18:56,860
Where do we go?

1937
02:18:57,460 --> 02:18:58,040
Oh, ammo.

1938
02:19:00,140 --> 02:19:00,440
Nice.

1939
02:19:00,700 --> 02:19:01,500
We actually need that.

1940
02:19:01,960 --> 02:19:02,740
Wait, there's a...

1941
02:19:02,740 --> 02:19:03,540
Oh, it's a rifle.

1942
02:19:04,820 --> 02:19:06,000
There's a sniper rifle.

1943
02:19:06,220 --> 02:19:07,300
Yeah, but I don't need that rifle.

1944
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:15,000
No, if we catarize it in time, if you shoot it, if you shotgun them to leg and catarize it in time.

1945
02:19:15,100 --> 02:19:17,480
See, we literally have, like, a fire bin.

1946
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:21,020
We didn't just pick him up and catarize his wounds, and he'll be fine.

1947
02:19:26,020 --> 02:19:27,140
Get in here.

1948
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:29,060
We've got some ammo in the back.

1949
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:31,360
We just took it.

1950
02:19:32,620 --> 02:19:34,400
Oh yeah, I'll use a long shot.

1951
02:19:34,580 --> 02:19:36,180
He might die from, like, infection.

1952
02:19:36,560 --> 02:19:38,340
But, like, that's the risk we're willing to take.

1953
02:19:40,980 --> 02:19:41,200
Locus!

1954
02:19:41,640 --> 02:19:42,240
Oh, shit.

1955
02:19:42,480 --> 02:19:43,020
Not the locust.

1956
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:48,220
Oh, shit.

1957
02:19:48,460 --> 02:19:49,760
I picked up the wrong gun.

1958
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:52,880
You equipped the wrong gun.

1959
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:54,280
I equipped the wrong one.

1960
02:19:55,100 --> 02:19:55,260
Oh!

1961
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:57,080
Hey, I'm next to you.

1962
02:19:59,040 --> 02:19:59,640
The one.

1963
02:20:00,140 --> 02:20:01,080
I got you.

1964
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:02,760
Wait, I got you.

1965
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:08,200
Okay, I'm going to go swap guns.

1966
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:09,060
I believe in you.

1967
02:20:10,200 --> 02:20:11,000
All right.

1968
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:13,260
Okay.

1969
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:14,920
Oh, God.

1970
02:20:15,220 --> 02:20:16,260
Rocket guy.

1971
02:20:16,660 --> 02:20:16,960
Don't worry.

1972
02:20:17,020 --> 02:20:17,780
I believe in you.

1973
02:20:18,960 --> 02:20:20,020
Okay, I got it.

1974
02:20:24,020 --> 02:20:25,700
Oh, my God.

1975
02:20:27,640 --> 02:20:29,240
Wait, is he going to kill us?

1976
02:20:35,780 --> 02:20:36,340
Boom.

1977
02:20:37,460 --> 02:20:38,580
There you go.

1978
02:20:38,840 --> 02:20:39,200
We got it.

1979
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:40,920
A random man got it.

1980
02:20:41,400 --> 02:20:41,820
Got you.

1981
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:44,440
Wait, there's a boom shot.

1982
02:20:45,820 --> 02:20:46,740
Yeah, that's his rocket.

1983
02:20:49,560 --> 02:20:50,500
I'm going to take cover.

1984
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:53,440
I'll take cover behind the gas tank.

1985
02:20:55,620 --> 02:20:58,540
Don't worry, I'll take cover behind the petrol station.

1986
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:00,520
Surely I'll be okay, right?

1987
02:21:01,020 --> 02:21:02,980
As long as they don't shoot it.

1988
02:21:03,400 --> 02:21:05,260
That's not a safety hazard whatsoever.

1989
02:21:06,720 --> 02:21:07,800
I'll be fine.

1990
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:09,640
Oh, I just...

1991
02:21:09,640 --> 02:21:10,240
I just...

1992
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:11,720
I just blew up a fucking...

1993
02:21:12,420 --> 02:21:15,420
I just blew up a canister next to a fuel station.

1994
02:21:15,780 --> 02:21:15,880
Whoops.

1995
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:18,180
Safety compliant.

1996
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:18,920
Ha ha ha.

1997
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:20,400
Yeah, it's empty.

1998
02:21:20,540 --> 02:21:21,240
It'll be fine.

1999
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:21,640
Control.

2000
02:21:22,060 --> 02:21:23,180
We've got the vehicle.

2001
02:21:23,740 --> 02:21:25,660
We're heading back to pick up the rest of the squad.

2002
02:21:26,620 --> 02:21:27,200

2003
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:30,340

02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:32,040

He's slowly killing us from the back.

2018
02:22:55,180 --> 02:22:57,920
I didn't realize they're behind us!

2019
02:22:58,360 --> 02:22:58,940

Oh, I can aim my light.

2038

Oh, my God, they're behind us.

2044
02:24:30,980 --> 02:24:32,000
They're behind us, aren't they?

2045
02:24:32,220 --> 02:24:33,180
They're behind us.

2046
02:24:34,520 --> 02:24:36,060
Look, man, I don't have...

2047
02:24:36,060 --> 02:24:39,940
Like, I say I have a third person perspective, but not the complete 360.

2048
02:24:40,140 --> 02:24:42,700
Yeah, I was going to say, like, I thought you have third person.

2049
02:24:42,720 --> 02:24:45,280
Listen, I need not see them behind us.

2050
02:24:45,360 --> 02:24:46,900
Okay, I thought there were more to buy.

2051
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:47,940

02:24:49,540 --> 02:24:50,200

I thought you were lying.

2054
02:24:52,980 --> 02:24:56,300
No, I can see them when they're really close to the vehicle.

2055
02:24:57,960 --> 02:24:59,180
I thought you were lying.

2056
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:02,500
It's like one krill.

2057
02:25:02,860 --> 02:25:04,280
You're scared of one guy.

2058
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:05,860
You're getting one guy, buddy.

2059

02:29:20,100 --> 02:29:20,480
I got nades.

2142
02:29:20,580 --> 02:29:21,100
Don't worry.

2143
02:29:21,180 --> 02:29:21,840
I got you.

2144
02:29:23,960 --> 02:29:24,280
Don't worry.

2145
02:29:24,380 --> 02:29:24,820
Don't kill him.

2146
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:25,440
Don't kill him.

2147
02:29:25,740 --> 02:29:26,260
I did it.

2148
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:28,140
Boom, baby.

2149
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:28,640
They did it.

2150
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:30,140
Hey.

2151
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:31,600
Okay, there's one more.

2152
02:29:31,700 --> 02:29:32,180
What the fuck?

2153
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:33,340
Wait, how did he live?

2154
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:40,080
Wait, there's like pool pain over there.

2155
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:41,760
Wait, he's still alive?

2156
02:29:42,760 --> 02:29:44,760
I was going to say, you're still shooting him?

2157
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:47,140
Oh, we could have done that.

2158
02:29:48,720 --> 02:29:49,720
Let's move out.

2159
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:52,420
Well, where did that come from?

2160
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:54,240
I shot that propane.

2161
02:29:54,580 --> 02:29:58,180
I was like, oh, we could have just did that.

2162
02:29:58,200 --> 02:29:59,260
We could have done that, huh?

2163
02:29:59,480 --> 02:30:01,720
Yeah, well, growing a frontal lobe, as you said.

2164
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:02,580
It's relatively different.

2165
02:30:02,700 --> 02:30:03,240
It grew!

2166
02:30:03,640 --> 02:30:06,560
It was, it was, look, I am on 200 ping, okay?

2167
02:30:06,960 --> 02:30:08,940
I need a static boost.

2168
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:11,340
Growing up propane.

2169
02:30:15,240 --> 02:30:17,400
Don't worry, we'll just get a refill of ammo.

2170
02:30:28,960 --> 02:30:31,760
I was like, wondering, I was like, why is there four propane there?

2171
02:30:32,140 --> 02:30:33,080
What would that be for?

2172
02:30:35,220 --> 02:30:35,540
Wow.

2173
02:30:36,620 --> 02:30:38,420
The cutscenes are made so fucking loud.

2174
02:30:38,660 --> 02:30:39,920
I can't even hear you in shit.

2175
02:30:43,540 --> 02:30:44,060
Wow.

2176
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:46,120
Looks like we're walking.

2177
02:30:46,600 --> 02:30:47,720
Are you kidding me?

2178
02:30:47,740 --> 02:30:48,120
No!

2179
02:30:48,740 --> 02:30:50,760
These things were made for walking.

2180
02:30:50,920 --> 02:30:52,340
It was made for shooting.

2181
02:30:54,480 --> 02:30:55,380
I guess we're walking.

2182
02:30:55,700 --> 02:30:57,460
There's clearly a fucking road.

2183
02:30:57,500 --> 02:30:59,100
Our vehicle is VOA.

2184
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:00,240
We're now on foot.

2185
02:31:00,660 --> 02:31:01,200
Please advise.

2186
02:31:02,880 --> 02:31:03,560
Copy that Delta.

2187
02:31:04,020 --> 02:31:05,920
The pumping station lift is offline.

2188
02:31:06,520 --> 02:31:08,860
Oh, so we don't get refilled ammo, by the way.

2189
02:31:09,400 --> 02:31:09,920
What?

2190
02:31:11,480 --> 02:31:12,820
We still don't have ammo.

2191
02:31:14,080 --> 02:31:14,440
Let's go.

2192
02:31:14,660 --> 02:31:15,800
You still don't have ammo.

2193
02:31:16,180 --> 02:31:17,300
Yeah, I barely have.

2194
02:31:17,440 --> 02:31:19,440
I have, I just have sniper and pistol.

2195
02:31:20,060 --> 02:31:20,160
Shit.

2196
02:31:20,460 --> 02:31:21,100
But you go first.

2197
02:31:21,260 --> 02:31:22,400
I don't have any log range.

2198
02:31:23,540 --> 02:31:24,280
I mean, short range.

2199
02:31:24,480 --> 02:31:25,740
You just need the right parts.

2200
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:29,080
All right.

2201
02:31:30,260 --> 02:31:31,840
It seems like a nice place.

2202
02:31:33,960 --> 02:31:34,700
Does it?

2203
02:31:35,400 --> 02:31:37,340
It seems like nice.

2204
02:31:37,900 --> 02:31:39,180
You know, we're one with nature.

2205
02:31:40,980 --> 02:31:42,640
Clearly nothing bad will happen here.

2206
02:31:42,920 --> 02:31:45,500
There's literally a fucking mine right there on the left.

2207
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:46,000
Where?

2208
02:31:47,060 --> 02:31:48,680
Right there on the right.

2209
02:31:48,880 --> 02:31:49,400
That's not a mine.

2210
02:31:49,480 --> 02:31:51,240
That's an oil rig.

2211
02:31:52,140 --> 02:31:52,600
Whatever, yeah.

2212
02:31:55,420 --> 02:31:56,960
Look, man, I can't see.

2213
02:31:57,740 --> 02:31:59,460
What do you mean, it's literally right next to us?

2214
02:31:59,580 --> 02:32:00,420
How do you not see that?

2215
02:32:00,900 --> 02:32:02,820
I didn't see the ocean, I go like.

2216
02:32:03,640 --> 02:32:05,460
Oh, yeah, the fucking water?

2217
02:32:06,380 --> 02:32:06,600
Yeah.

2218
02:32:08,280 --> 02:32:09,500
I didn't see the water.

2219
02:32:09,760 --> 02:32:12,120
It didn't fucking like enter the view range.

2220
02:32:14,300 --> 02:32:15,900
Alright, we'll just go in here.

2221
02:32:16,400 --> 02:32:17,420
Wait, what's this factory?

2222
02:32:17,860 --> 02:32:19,060
What the hell is that with me?

2223
02:32:19,480 --> 02:32:21,100
Means they glow in the dark.

2224
02:32:21,240 --> 02:32:22,180
Can we shoot it?

2225
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:23,840
Yeah, they do.

2226
02:32:24,480 --> 02:32:55,200
you can't shoot it why i don't know maybe i'll snipe it done i thought i could snipe it it was they were just fucking climbing for free jesus christ is cutscene after one open that door it was 2006 it was all cutscenes right won't work these doors are too thick you don't know that he can do it go jack control this is delta we're at the factory but the entrance is blocked Copy that,

2227
02:32:55,220 --> 02:32:55,600
Delta.

2228
02:32:56,240 --> 02:32:57,400
Oh, you heard the wreck.

2229
02:32:57,660 --> 02:32:59,580
I don't see any other options on my screen.

2230
02:33:01,260 --> 02:33:01,480
All right.

2231
02:33:01,880 --> 02:33:03,800
This will go faster if we split up.

2232
02:33:04,500 --> 02:33:06,120
Cole, Baird, you head that way.

2233
02:33:06,620 --> 02:33:07,300
We'll head right.

2234
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:09,360
Radio us when you find an entrance.

2235
02:33:09,540 --> 02:33:10,120
Oh, man.

2236
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:10,560
I don't know.

2237
02:33:10,620 --> 02:33:11,860
That sounds like a bad idea.

2238
02:33:12,380 --> 02:33:14,660
I'll be sure to take that under advisement, Cole.

2239
02:33:15,240 --> 02:33:16,280
Now move it.

2240
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:17,520
Yes, sir!

2241
02:33:17,960 --> 02:33:21,240
How come he didn't listen to the Cole train?

2242
02:33:22,120 --> 02:33:23,620
He knows what he's talking about.

2243
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:25,760
You're a leader, Coltrane.

2244
02:33:26,120 --> 02:33:27,120
But it's...

2245
02:33:27,120 --> 02:33:27,700
But it's...

2246
02:33:27,700 --> 02:33:28,740
He hurt his feelings.

2247
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:30,580
You're an asshole.

2248
02:33:33,080 --> 02:33:35,180
I think Marcus is not a good guy.

2249
02:33:35,940 --> 02:33:37,120
Shoot your lit knees.

2250
02:33:37,460 --> 02:33:38,080
Marcus is a dick.

2251
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:39,900
Yeah, Marcus is an asshole.

2252
02:33:41,240 --> 02:33:42,360
Who made him leader?

2253
02:33:42,840 --> 02:33:43,780
We're all stupid.

2254
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:46,780
We were all grown in the same lab.

2255
02:33:51,020 --> 02:33:53,100
Who let you decide?

2256
02:33:55,020 --> 02:34:21,020
oh nice you took the wrong gun i took the wrong gun where's my other gun wait what happened to my other gun it disappeared wait what happened see that what happens to me i fucking picked up my other guy i had 400 ammo in my other gun no it disappeared no it disappeared what did the

2257
02:34:24,480 --> 02:34:25,660
He disappeared!

2258
02:34:26,380 --> 02:34:29,900
I think I got 400 bullets and then it was gone.

2259
02:34:31,820 --> 02:34:33,060
Where did you go?

2260
02:34:33,860 --> 02:34:35,100
I just nabbed some ammo.

2261
02:34:35,380 --> 02:34:37,520
They like fucking fell down to the ground.

2262
02:34:37,980 --> 02:34:38,760
I literally got...

2263
02:34:38,760 --> 02:34:39,120
I don't know.

2264
02:34:39,140 --> 02:34:46,380
Have you seen that CSGO clip where they were playing rank and then like the entire team just fell down the like the floor?

2265
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:48,200
What?

2266
02:34:48,560 --> 02:34:52,680
Yeah, it was like some ranking and they were...

2267
02:34:52,680 --> 02:34:56,540
We started the game, and they all just disappeared under the floor while they were rotating.

2268
02:34:57,920 --> 02:34:59,440
I was like, what the fuck?

2269
02:34:59,780 --> 02:35:01,060
That's goofy shit.

2270
02:35:01,720 --> 02:35:02,880
Wait, how did you get through?

2271
02:35:03,660 --> 02:35:04,940
Oh my God, TPed.

2272
02:35:04,940 --> 02:35:06,560
I was like, how did you get through the gate?

2273
02:35:07,020 --> 02:35:07,720
I'm dead.

2274
02:35:08,280 --> 02:35:08,720
Oh, God.

2275
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:10,880
There's so many of them.

2276
02:35:11,240 --> 02:35:11,960
They blow up.

2277
02:35:12,100 --> 02:35:12,560
They did.

2278
02:35:12,660 --> 02:35:12,940
Yeah.

2279
02:35:13,380 --> 02:35:15,620
I was literally like, how did you get through the gate?

2280
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:17,880
I mean, what gate?

2281
02:35:18,360 --> 02:35:22,480
There was a gate in front of, you were like past the gate, and I was just watching you.

2282
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:23,740
It's TP me.

2283
02:35:24,520 --> 02:35:24,820
Nah.

2284
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:27,040
You've seen things.

2285
02:35:28,980 --> 02:35:29,280
Okay.

2286
02:35:32,220 --> 02:35:33,740
Oh my god, I wish I had my shotgun.

2287
02:35:34,780 --> 02:35:35,100
Right now.

2288
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:36,480
I wish I had my other gun.

2289
02:35:38,860 --> 02:35:40,720
Hey, burst fire means you're saving more ammo.

2290
02:35:40,980 --> 02:35:51,020
CSO go to where they, apparently it was like a new map that got released or something in CS, CS2 and then like, and they just like, they just like fell through the ground.

But underground in the dark?

2294
02:37:26,360 --> 02:37:27,080
We're not underground.

2295
02:37:27,780 --> 02:37:28,000
Yeah.

2296
02:37:28,740 --> 02:37:29,560
We're above ground.

2297
02:37:29,900 --> 02:37:31,220
Hey, don't tell Barred that.

2298
02:37:31,580 --> 02:37:33,160
He's scared shitless as it is.

2299
02:37:33,360 --> 02:37:37,660
Oh, we made the other two go underground because they're NPCs.

2300
02:37:38,020 --> 02:37:39,720
Yeah, because they're...

2301
02:37:39,720 --> 02:37:44,220
Even though Player 2 has no rights, Player 3 and Player 4 have even less.

2302
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:45,180
Yep.

2303
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:46,300
Correct.

2304
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:47,580
Because we're still players.

2305
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:48,620
What the fuck?

2306
02:37:48,760 --> 02:37:49,260
Did we just...

2307
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:49,980
Did I...

2308
02:37:49,980 --> 02:37:50,940
Did we just teleport?

2309
02:37:51,340 --> 02:37:51,860
Yeah, we did.

2310
02:37:52,020 --> 02:37:52,580
Where did you go?

02:38:25,800 --> 02:38:26,840
No, even if they are players.

2314
02:38:29,440 --> 02:38:31,460
Wait, there's people, there's ammo here.

2315
02:38:32,200 --> 02:38:33,440
Nice, thank god he died.

2316
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:34,660
It's Elvis.

02:38:37,260 --> 02:38:38,240
Yeah, Elvis.

2318
02:38:38,460 --> 02:38:39,220
It's Elvis Presley.

2319
02:38:40,020 --> 02:38:40,640
How'd you know that?

2320
02:38:40,940 --> 02:38:42,400
Because he died in the toilet.

2321
02:38:44,260 --> 02:38:44,860
Wait, he did?

2322
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:45,700
You didn't know that?

2323
02:38:45,800 --> 02:38:48,680
Yeah, he went to the bathroom and died while pooping.

2324
02:38:50,640 --> 02:38:51,140
Fun fact.

2325
02:38:51,300 --> 02:38:51,540
Fun.

2326
02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:52,420
Sounds fire.

2327
02:38:53,380 --> 02:38:54,960
Is that how you want to go?

2328
02:38:56,580 --> 02:38:58,420
Poop too hard, you got a heart attack?

2329
02:38:59,320 --> 02:39:00,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2330
02:39:02,960 --> 02:39:05,560
Imagine pooping too hard, you get a heart attack.

2331
02:39:05,880 --> 02:39:07,540
That's, actually, I don't even remember the car.

2332
02:39:07,600 --> 02:39:09,060
I just knew he died in the bathroom.

2333
02:39:10,760 --> 02:39:11,880
Oh, it was a heart attack!

2334
02:39:12,080 --> 02:39:13,960
Yeah, he pooped too hard and got a heart attack.

2335
02:39:14,660 --> 02:39:16,540
That's, that was some shit.

2336
02:39:20,180 --> 02:39:22,540

It's all in our minds.

2343
02:42:00,020 --> 02:42:01,340
Come on, stranger.

2344
02:42:02,180 --> 02:42:03,280
Am I looking on the grass?

2345
02:42:03,560 --> 02:42:04,080
Oh, hey.

2346
02:42:04,320 --> 02:42:04,960
He's below us.

2347
02:42:05,740 --> 02:42:07,180
Yeah, I was like, why am I looking again?

2348
02:42:07,860 --> 02:42:08,840
There's room for one more.

2349
02:42:08,920 --> 02:42:09,800
It's a fucking party down here.

2350
02:42:09,940 --> 02:42:10,540
No thanks.

2351
02:42:10,840 --> 02:42:11,540
Keep moving.

2352
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:13,160
We'll see you at the carts.

2353
02:42:15,400 --> 02:42:17,140
I feel like this guy's gonna die.

2354
02:42:17,500 --> 02:42:18,200
He doesn't...

2355
02:42:18,200 --> 02:42:19,080
Oh, but he's not...

2356
02:42:19,080 --> 02:42:21,420
He's not wearing a helmet, though, so he might live.

2357
02:42:21,940 --> 02:42:22,640
He's wearing a hat.

2358
02:42:24,460 --> 02:42:24,880
That's true.

2359
02:42:24,920 --> 02:42:25,440
Oh, true.

2360
02:42:25,960 --> 02:42:26,780
Maybe he'll half die.

2361
02:42:27,240 --> 02:42:29,520
He'll get shot in the leg, and then we leave him to death.

2362
02:42:29,740 --> 02:42:31,200
Can we please just leave?

2363
02:42:31,760 --> 02:42:33,140
But I'm grabbing ammo.

2364
02:42:33,580 --> 02:42:33,880
No.

2365
02:42:35,980 --> 02:42:37,060
Grabbing ammo.

2366
02:42:38,120 --> 02:42:38,340
Ah!

2367
02:42:38,780 --> 02:42:39,600
Don't grab ammo!

2368
02:42:39,940 --> 02:42:40,820
Don't grab ammo!

2369
02:42:41,720 --> 02:42:44,000
Well, I'm with the stranded guy.

2370
02:42:46,280 --> 02:42:47,800
I don't know where you are.

2371
02:42:48,400 --> 02:42:49,280
I'm coming over.

2372
02:42:49,620 --> 02:42:50,640
I grabbed ammo.

2373
02:42:54,840 --> 02:42:56,140
Was the ammo worth it?

2374
02:42:56,180 --> 02:42:58,380
It was, they'd been, yeah, I got 100 bullets.

2375
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:01,480
Yeah, you used it immediately?

2376
02:43:02,500 --> 02:43:04,760
I used two bullets, okay?

2377
02:43:04,860 --> 02:43:05,940
I have 98 left.

2378
02:43:06,800 --> 02:43:08,260
We're gonna fall, yeah.

2379
02:43:09,320 --> 02:43:11,680
Oh, I told you he wasn't gonna live.

2380
02:43:12,960 --> 02:43:13,820
Well, he's gone.

2381
02:43:14,320 --> 02:43:15,080
He wore a helmet.

2382
02:43:16,120 --> 02:43:17,340
Well, he was wearing a hat.

2383
02:43:17,720 --> 02:43:17,860
Yeah.

2384
02:43:19,160 --> 02:43:20,620
Just watch your step.

2385
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:22,040
How do we know which one?

2386
02:43:23,500 --> 02:43:25,040
Yeah, I was like, How do we know?

2387
02:43:25,220 --> 02:43:25,980
Oh, it's the one.

2388
02:43:26,220 --> 02:43:26,800
You see that?

2389
02:43:26,880 --> 02:43:27,720
It's the one that's lighter.

2390
02:43:27,800 --> 02:43:28,260
You see it?

2391
02:43:28,780 --> 02:43:29,240
You know what?

2392
02:43:29,560 --> 02:43:30,640
Yeah, you see this one?

2393
02:43:30,760 --> 02:43:32,320
This one, I swear, this one has to be.

2394
02:43:34,520 --> 02:43:34,800
Wait.

2395
02:43:35,300 --> 02:43:37,180
See, I told you it's the one that's lighter.

2396
02:43:37,440 --> 02:43:37,940
You see that?

2397
02:43:38,300 --> 02:43:39,160
I told you.

2398
02:43:39,600 --> 02:43:41,780
It's like the movies, you know, the animation.

2399
02:43:42,340 --> 02:43:43,720
Like, if it's lighter.

2400
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:46,640
Yeah, well, now where do we go?

2401
02:43:47,060 --> 02:43:49,480
Wait, I don't think we can go here because it's...

2402
02:43:50,280 --> 02:43:53,040
Bro, and this, the monster won't shut up, bro.

2403
02:43:53,140 --> 02:43:54,040
Holy fuck.

2404
02:43:54,460 --> 02:44:16,480
I think it's this way Try It is lighter, but that could just be the lighting I mean, there's no other way Yeah, go, go That's some Scooby-Doo shit Scooby-Doo type shit Okay, that's, this is fine, this is fine I think it's that one is just the lighting Because the lamp is directly under it Yeah,

2405
02:44:16,480 --> 02:44:17,040
go!

2406
02:44:17,480 --> 02:44:19,060
You're out here creaking out here creaking, right?

2407
02:44:19,220 --> 02:44:32,580
You're creaking It's just people screaming Just go I told you it was just a lamp I'm pretty sure that that one I'm pretty sure that is that

2408
02:44:37,740 --> 02:44:56,180
I was right though I was right it was that one I just went forward after I said that I well hello hello I made it went forward when I said that.

2409
02:44:59,960 --> 02:45:00,600
Okay.

2410
02:45:04,800 --> 02:45:05,900
Oh my god.

2411
02:45:09,580 --> 02:45:10,860
I'm smart.

2412
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:11,820
Where are you?

2413
02:45:13,820 --> 02:45:14,820
I'm here.

2414
02:45:15,460 --> 02:45:16,060
I'm here.

2415
02:45:16,220 --> 02:45:17,680
I don't have a sniper.

2416
02:45:18,540 --> 02:45:19,940
And I don't have a shotgun.

2417
02:45:21,420 --> 02:45:22,540
Oh, help.

2418
02:45:22,840 --> 02:45:24,440
I don't have a shotgun.

2419
02:45:25,340 --> 02:45:26,540
God damn it.

2420
02:45:27,880 --> 02:45:29,000
Okay, now we don't.

2421
02:45:29,120 --> 02:45:30,860
The perfect timing is crazy.

2422
02:45:31,200 --> 02:45:32,240
Wait, we have to do this again?

2423
02:45:32,420 --> 02:45:32,700
Okay.

2424
02:45:32,940 --> 02:45:34,580
If we cut through here, we'll be alright.

2425
02:45:36,580 --> 02:45:38,080
I forgot the pathway.

2426
02:45:38,780 --> 02:45:39,540
Oh, there it is.

2427
02:45:43,290 --> 02:45:45,330
Okay, it was like forward.

2428
02:45:45,910 --> 02:45:46,670
Shit, he's gone.

2429
02:45:47,070 --> 02:45:48,090
Wait, can we do this?

2430
02:45:48,230 --> 02:45:49,290
I don't think we can.

2431
02:45:49,930 --> 02:45:51,550
I think it was like here.

2432
02:45:52,270 --> 02:45:53,430
Damn, I hate this place.

2433
02:45:59,530 --> 02:46:26,030
it wasn't there it wasn't there it wasn't there i think it's randomized no my scooby-doo hypothesis you good no my scooby-doo i thought i was so smart why did it be false

2434
02:46:31,110 --> 02:46:51,330
I believe in you oh I believe in you where are you I don't I'm on the ground I don't know don't know hey I'm running I'm running

2435
02:46:56,110 --> 02:46:56,990
Apparently a ladder.

2436
02:46:58,350 --> 02:46:59,070
A ladder?

2437
02:46:59,870 --> 02:47:00,750
Yeah, we're still at...

2438
02:47:00,750 --> 02:47:00,910
Oh, here.

2439
02:47:01,090 --> 02:47:01,350
Oh, wait.

2440
02:47:01,390 --> 02:47:01,790
There's a shotgun.

2441
02:47:02,270 --> 02:47:02,330
Oh!

2442
02:47:03,830 --> 02:47:05,190
Oh, I need to grab the shotgun.

2443
02:47:05,610 --> 02:47:06,590
Do not mind if I do.

2444
02:47:06,830 --> 02:47:07,350
Oh, my God.

2445
02:47:07,450 --> 02:47:07,850
Thank God.

2446
02:47:08,030 --> 02:47:08,790
You found the ladder?

2447
02:47:09,410 --> 02:47:09,590
Nope.

2448
02:47:09,670 --> 02:47:09,910
You did.

2449
02:47:10,030 --> 02:47:10,210
Okay.

2450
02:47:14,620 --> 02:47:14,980
Okay.

2451
02:47:15,840 --> 02:47:16,880
We made it.

2452
02:47:18,300 --> 02:47:19,420
Wait, no, we didn't.

2453
02:47:19,540 --> 02:47:20,460
We just do this again.

2454
02:47:21,040 --> 02:47:21,860
Is it to the right?

2455
02:47:22,620 --> 02:47:23,300
I don't know.

2456
02:47:23,380 --> 02:47:25,940
I did the right path and it still fell.

2457
02:47:27,060 --> 02:47:27,420
This?

2458
02:47:28,680 --> 02:47:30,180
Oh, it is randomized.

2459
02:47:30,360 --> 02:47:31,060
Wait, it's different now.

2460
02:47:31,480 --> 02:47:32,320
It is.

2461
02:47:32,500 --> 02:47:33,300
That was like, what the fuck?

2462
02:47:34,460 --> 02:47:35,700
Yeah, it's different.

2463
02:47:37,960 --> 02:47:38,400
Ah!

2464
02:47:39,280 --> 02:47:40,700
Nope, not going there.

2465
02:47:45,780 --> 02:47:47,660
Wait, maybe to that, right?

2466
02:47:48,460 --> 02:47:50,820
Well, at least it's close to the fucking ladder.

2467
02:47:52,240 --> 02:47:53,580
That looks light as shit.

2468
02:47:55,540 --> 02:47:56,620
Is it safe?

2469
02:47:58,060 --> 02:48:00,200
No, no, no, no, no.

2470
02:48:02,240 --> 02:48:04,220
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

2471
02:48:04,380 --> 02:48:06,940
I know where to, I know where to go for half of it.

2472
02:48:07,700 --> 02:48:08,540
I'm running, though.

2473
02:48:08,660 --> 02:48:09,000
I'm running.

2474
02:48:09,160 --> 02:48:11,020
I don't remember where the ladder is.

2475
02:48:12,240 --> 02:48:12,840
I remember.

2476
02:48:14,320 --> 02:48:15,060
I got it.

2477
02:48:16,500 --> 02:48:21,380
Okay, we go to the, we go to, like, the right side.

2478
02:48:23,360 --> 02:48:24,380
Wait, how did he get over there?

2479
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:28,040
I went, like, not that way.

2480
02:48:28,980 --> 02:48:29,540
Shit.

2481
02:48:30,880 --> 02:48:31,680
What did you get there?

2482
02:48:32,440 --> 02:48:32,980
Yeah, whatever.

2483
02:48:33,220 --> 02:48:33,660
I forgot.

2484
02:48:33,820 --> 02:48:38,020
I can't think because of this mono screaming audio, bro.

2485
02:48:38,500 --> 02:48:39,060
Holy shit.

2486
02:48:44,800 --> 02:48:47,640
It's a fucking friendly fast beer scream.

2487
02:48:49,420 --> 02:48:50,560
Okay, I figured it out.

2488
02:48:51,880 --> 02:48:52,700
Okay, never mind.

2489
02:48:54,120 --> 02:48:55,680
Wait, I think I figured it out.

2490
02:48:59,810 --> 02:49:31,650

2492
02:49:33,030 --> 02:49:33,630
I got one.

2493
02:49:33,690 --> 02:49:35,690
I think this is a shotgun area.

2494
02:49:36,130 --> 02:49:37,570
Yeah, I think so too.

2495
02:49:37,930 --> 02:49:39,550
This looks like a shotgun area.

2496
02:49:41,010 --> 02:49:41,810
Oh yeah, 100%.

2497
02:49:42,370 --> 02:49:45,630
They're fucking screaming in our mono directional ear.

2498
02:49:46,450 --> 02:49:49,730
Bro, I swear the mono directional is so annoying bro.

2499
02:49:50,250 --> 02:49:50,870
Oh my god.

2500
02:49:52,590 --> 02:49:52,750
TP!

2501
02:49:55,030 --> 02:49:57,050
I'm getting used to the glass pad.

2502
02:49:58,050 --> 02:49:59,510
It's still like, it's so smooth.

2503
02:49:59,810 --> 02:50:03,470
Like, like, I have, like, no friction whatsoever.

2504
02:50:06,030 --> 02:50:07,650
I love being constantly creating.

2505
02:50:07,750 --> 02:50:08,690
The price is kind of...

2506
02:50:11,790 --> 02:50:12,730
Okay, nice.

2507
02:50:14,170 --> 02:50:15,230

02:50:20,130 --> 02:50:20,790
Can we do it?

2510
02:50:21,490 --> 02:50:23,370

02:50:23,530 --> 02:50:24,370

2512
02:50:25,210 --> 02:50:25,910

2525
02:51:47,390 --> 02:51:48,050
So I guess it's bad.

2526
02:51:48,830 --> 02:51:50,270
No, it's trash.

A train?

2535
02:52:44,650 --> 02:52:47,390
yeah he's basically an A train before he killed his girlfriend

2536
02:52:50,890 --> 02:53:32,490
before the trauma sets in bruh I don't actually watch the boys you didn't want oh it's good only season one and two though season three just can't commit to shows you know season three is weird it's gonna actually season two was weird too okay let's see this okay you know supernatural um uh have you ever watched supernatural yeah um so it's made by the same creator it's made by eric cryptkey um so that's why you see like lots of actors from supernatural in uh the boys But the thing about Supernatural and the creator,

2537
02:53:32,870 --> 02:53:36,610
Eric Kripke, is that the longer the show goes, the worse it gets.

2538
02:53:37,250 --> 02:53:46,450
And he, like, for some reason, he really, really, really likes to put a lot of sex scenes in the boys.

2539
02:53:47,890 --> 02:53:49,970
For no reason.

2540
02:53:50,150 --> 02:53:52,290
It's like, there's a lot of rant.

2541
02:53:52,650 --> 02:54:00,890
Like, every, and season two, every episode, either someone dies or there's, like, There's like a banging scene.

2542
02:54:01,350 --> 02:54:03,310
Like, or like they add both together.

2543
02:54:04,750 --> 02:54:05,190
Or...

2544
02:54:05,190 --> 02:54:08,910
I don't know, I don't even know if I want to watch it.

2545
02:54:09,250 --> 02:54:09,990
Every episode.

2546
02:54:10,170 --> 02:54:14,210
Like, it was fine in season one, because it was like every, like, couple of...

2547
02:54:14,210 --> 02:54:15,770
Like, it wasn't, like, every episode.

2548
02:54:16,130 --> 02:54:18,530
Yeah, it's either sex and death or both.

2549
02:54:20,830 --> 02:54:26,710
So, like, at that point, it was, like, way too excessive, because it was literally every episode.

2550
02:54:27,810 --> 02:54:28,750
But, like, no, the car...

2551
02:54:28,750 --> 02:55:34,610
No, everyone's like, it was like that in the comics no the comics was like comics were like so bad because the cop the the material is based off of um the guy wrote the boy like wrote the boys because he just fucking hated superheroes so it was just like he was just a fucking superhero anti yeah like legit i don't want to watch the shows because i might get distracted you might get distracted i mean it's one hour per episode that's the thing do you do you think to do no exactly yeah but um the new season for it was like meh it just it was like it i just felt like the story was like got worse what the do we go where do we go i didn't pay attention to what he was saying i thought like cole could tell us where to go cole can you tps somewhere coal take us the coal train on the ride let us ride the coal train take us to the goal please

I'm crouch running.

2557
02:56:06,100 --> 02:56:08,380
This is the other side.

2558
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:10,080
Is it not?

2559
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:12,040

Yellow paint!

2561
02:56:14,700 --> 02:56:16,260
Everything has a yellow paint.

2562
02:56:21,980 --> 02:56:24,380
Wait, opposite side of the other axis.

2563
02:56:24,620 --> 02:56:26,120
Oh, try that side.

2564
02:56:26,960 --> 02:56:27,440

02:58:59,920 --> 02:59:01,120
This is the crawlies.

2611
02:59:01,260 --> 02:59:05,960
Yeah, this is in first gear like we're parking I feel like we're parking our mine cart right now.

2612
02:59:05,960 --> 02:59:07,820
What the fuck is this cart going bro?

2613
02:59:08,080 --> 02:59:09,240
Where are you?

2614
02:59:10,860 --> 02:59:18,780
It's like beep beep beep We're like we're on the parking gear

2615
02:59:21,960 --> 02:59:23,140
No, it's going fast.

2616
02:59:23,460 --> 02:59:25,240
Okay, it's going a little faster now.

2617
02:59:25,680 --> 02:59:26,000
Oh no.

2618
02:59:26,360 --> 02:59:27,300
Are you serious?

2619
02:59:27,540 --> 02:59:29,320
That's actually bullshit.

2620
02:59:32,380 --> 02:59:34,160
Like, it fell on top of me.

2621
02:59:34,280 --> 02:59:35,920
Like, there's two hits!

2622
02:59:36,420 --> 02:59:38,180
Oh, I'm just going to ignore it.

2623
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:42,200
Dude, I barely even had to do anything.

2624
02:59:42,400 --> 02:59:44,320
Like, the cart grabs them, and they die.

2625
02:59:44,820 --> 02:59:46,920
My cart, I, like, literally just rammed past it.

2626
02:59:46,920 --> 02:59:48,300
Like, what's the point of shooting them?

2627
02:59:50,680 --> 02:59:51,720
What the hell?

2628
02:59:54,260 --> 02:59:54,740
Beep.

2633
02:59:58,820 --> 02:59:58,820
Boom.

2634
02:59:58,840 --> 03:00:00,400
Oh, God.

2635
03:00:02,080 --> 03:00:03,100

2636
03:00:03,800 --> 03:00:04,760

2637
03:00:04,760 --> 03:00:05,300

03:12:45,790 --> 03:12:47,010
Your ammo, ammo, ammo, ammo.

2804
03:12:47,210 --> 03:12:47,810
Oh, yeah, nice.

2805
03:12:47,990 --> 03:12:49,470
I don't need that much ammo, though.

2806
03:12:49,750 --> 03:12:50,390
Yeah, it's a shotgun.

2807
03:12:52,850 --> 03:12:53,710
Oh, my God.

2808
03:12:53,750 --> 03:12:54,270
I'm getting closer.

2809
03:12:54,630 --> 03:12:55,230
Fuck this.

2810
03:12:59,850 --> 03:13:01,130
I'm just going to shotgun here.

2811
03:13:02,170 --> 03:13:03,270
He's got a shotgun.

2812
03:13:04,530 --> 03:13:04,730
Good.

2813
03:13:06,130 --> 03:13:06,910
There's a shotgun.

2817
03:13:11,650 --> 03:13:12,630
Let's do this.

2818
03:13:13,210 --> 03:13:13,510
All right.

2819
03:13:13,650 --> 03:13:14,610
We do this again.

2820
03:13:16,170 --> 03:13:16,830
Okay, you got this.

2821
03:13:16,950 --> 03:13:18,230
Do you want to get another headshot?

2822
03:13:19,170 --> 03:13:19,750

2823
03:13:21,070 --> 03:13:22,850

2825
03:13:24,090 --> 03:13:25,210
Where's the fucking recoil guns?

2826
03:13:26,350 --> 03:13:26,610
Okay.

Next one.

2828
03:13:27,350 --> 03:13:28,190
Go to the door.

2829
03:13:28,710 --> 03:13:29,410
What's the door?

2830
03:13:30,470 --> 03:13:31,370

That's five big booms.

2848
03:14:58,530 --> 03:15:00,530
He probably only has a one.

2849
03:15:01,470 --> 03:15:02,570
Wait, there's an amateur left.

2850
03:15:03,070 --> 03:15:04,350
We'll have to find another way.

2851
03:15:04,530 --> 03:15:06,330
I don't have a lot of ammo left.

2852
03:15:06,570 --> 03:15:07,690
Yeah, there's ammo there.

2853
03:15:09,510 --> 03:15:10,130
And grab that.

2854
03:15:10,250 --> 03:15:11,350
Wait, is that the chainsaw gun?

2855
03:15:12,350 --> 03:15:13,310
No, it's a fucking shotgun.

2856
03:15:13,530 --> 03:15:13,650

There's another ammo.

2870
03:15:44,590 --> 03:15:45,210
Nice, I'll need that.

2871
03:15:45,210 --> 03:15:45,770
I'll keep moving.

2872
03:15:45,970 --> 03:15:49,790
If you get to the pumping station first, you'll guide us in.

2873
03:15:50,030 --> 03:15:50,270
Deal?

2874
03:15:51,230 --> 03:15:51,570
Okay.

03:15:53,510 --> 03:15:54,170
All right.

03:15:55,270 --> 03:15:56,110
Oh, I just...

2878
03:15:56,110 --> 03:15:57,810
Oh, yeah, I was just using pistol rounds.

2879
03:15:59,070 --> 03:15:59,950
Like, where are you fighting?

2880
03:16:00,870 --> 03:16:02,410
Oh, sit behind us!

2881
03:16:07,110 --> 03:16:07,990
Oh, my God.

2882
03:16:08,010 --> 03:16:10,010
But they're so tanky.

2883
03:16:13,570 --> 03:16:14,450
We're fine.

2884
03:16:16,790 --> 03:16:18,250
Oh my god, not nice.

2885
03:16:21,730 --> 03:16:22,950

2886
03:16:23,270 --> 03:16:23,870
Yeah, what is he?

2887
03:16:23,930 --> 03:16:26,430
He just went, he got a cry to die.

2888
03:16:28,550 --> 03:16:29,610
He's like, oh my god.

2889
03:16:30,150 --> 03:16:32,070
I'm preparing my special move.

2890
03:16:32,370 --> 03:16:33,890
Just don't shoot me.

2891
03:16:35,850 --> 03:16:37,470
We gotta split up and find that station.

2892
03:16:39,670 --> 03:16:40,450
I'm gonna split up.

2893
03:16:41,270 --> 03:16:41,710
Okay.

2894
03:16:41,810 --> 03:16:42,830
I want to go right.

2895
03:16:43,130 --> 03:16:43,590
This is a choice again.

2896
03:16:43,710 --> 03:16:44,710

2897
03:16:44,870 --> 03:16:45,850

2898
03:16:47,270 --> 03:16:47,690
Okay.

03:21:50,470 --> 03:21:51,830
Bro, this death...

2979
03:21:51,830 --> 03:21:52,430
Oh, wait, nice.

2980
03:21:54,790 --> 03:21:56,890
His dad works at Microsoft.

2981
03:21:57,710 --> 03:21:59,530
And he put it in a visible wall.

2982
03:21:59,990 --> 03:22:00,410
Hell yeah.

2983
03:22:02,470 --> 03:22:03,130
I don't know.

2984
03:22:03,150 --> 03:22:05,130
I think I'm doing so.

2985
03:22:05,190 --> 03:22:05,990
Okay, you killed him.

2986
03:22:06,110 --> 03:22:07,050
I'll kill this guy.

2987
03:22:08,170 --> 03:22:09,770
I think I'm hitting him.

2988
03:22:09,910 --> 03:22:10,390
I can't tell.

2989
03:22:10,410 --> 03:22:15,110
I mean, if it's the crosshair is not red, I'm assuming I'm not hitting him.

2990
03:22:15,210 --> 03:22:15,490
No, I did.

2991
03:22:15,610 --> 03:22:15,770
I did.

2992
03:22:15,990 --> 03:22:16,950
When he left, yeah.

2993
03:22:17,870 --> 03:22:18,850
I'm doing it.

2994
03:22:19,130 --> 03:22:20,250
I'm slowly backing up.

2995
03:22:21,030 --> 03:22:22,010
Yeah, he's a Nepo crab.

2996
03:22:23,150 --> 03:22:24,890
I'm shooting his stomach too.

2997
03:22:26,010 --> 03:22:26,390
Begun!

2998
03:22:26,950 --> 03:22:27,770
A Nepo crab!

2999
03:22:28,530 --> 03:22:29,010
Begun!

3000
03:22:29,630 --> 03:22:29,850
Okay.

3001
03:22:30,510 --> 03:22:31,210
Smash it.

3002
03:22:31,950 --> 03:22:32,430
Smashable.

3003
03:22:32,550 --> 03:22:33,310
How do I smash it?

3004
03:22:34,310 --> 03:22:35,410
I would like to know.

3005
03:22:35,690 --> 03:22:36,870
Yeah, how do I...

3006
03:22:36,870 --> 03:22:37,790
I would like to know.

3007
03:22:38,370 --> 03:22:38,850
Um...

3008
03:22:38,850 --> 03:22:39,890
I'm gonna throw meat on it.

3009
03:22:40,410 --> 03:22:43,950
Whatever I'm shooting it is shoot smash.

3010
03:22:44,270 --> 03:22:45,950
The shoot equals smash.

3011
03:22:46,290 --> 03:22:47,130
Oh shit.

3012
03:22:49,450 --> 03:22:50,210
Oh shit.

3013
03:22:50,410 --> 03:22:50,930
Oh, he's smashing.

3014
03:22:51,070 --> 03:22:57,210
Oh, I did it by doing nothing at all He needs to smash the area.

3015
03:22:57,450 --> 03:23:01,290
Okay Do you smash everything?

3016
03:23:02,330 --> 03:23:04,110
Okay, you need to smash this probably gonna die here.

3017
03:23:04,350 --> 03:23:05,030
There you go.

3018
03:23:05,150 --> 03:23:12,190
You just need to smash this part There you go There I smashed it.

3019
03:23:12,290 --> 03:23:13,350
I think we're just pissing it off.

3020
03:23:14,430 --> 03:23:15,510
I smash everything?

3021
03:23:18,690 --> 03:23:20,230
You need to stand on the area maybe?

3022
03:23:20,910 --> 03:23:22,170
I mean I can stand here again.

3023
03:23:24,530 --> 03:23:26,490
He's already smashed it.

3024
03:23:27,950 --> 03:23:29,530
Is it probably not smashing it?

3025
03:23:29,550 --> 03:23:30,130
Oh, there you go.

3026
03:23:30,290 --> 03:23:31,370
We just have to smash it again.

3027
03:23:35,440 --> 03:23:36,180
There you go.

3028
03:23:36,740 --> 03:23:37,920

I don't think I can count that high Need ammo ammo.

3034
03:25:23,130 --> 03:25:29,870
Yeah, and I'm running out of shotgun ammo too I saw something try using the shotgun.

3035
03:25:30,270 --> 03:25:31,470
It's just not for me.

3036
03:25:31,490 --> 03:25:37,510
I was using a shotgun for the crab There's nothing over on this side.

3037
03:25:37,770 --> 03:25:38,390
There's nothing here.

3038
03:25:38,470 --> 03:25:38,910
Yeah, I was gonna say it.

3039
03:25:38,910 --> 03:25:39,770
You want me to live there?

3040
03:25:39,990 --> 03:25:40,570
What the fuck?

3041
03:25:40,710 --> 03:25:42,090
Yeah, why did it make us go?

3042
03:25:42,250 --> 03:25:44,370
They literally baited us.

3043
03:25:44,650 --> 03:25:45,990
What is that even for?

3044
03:25:46,350 --> 03:25:47,330
Oh, there's gonna be enemies here.

3045
03:25:47,430 --> 03:25:48,070
There's so much cover.

3046
03:25:49,170 --> 03:25:50,110
Oh, for sure.

3047
03:25:50,650 --> 03:25:51,630
Wait, no?

3048
03:25:51,830 --> 03:25:53,410
Why would they put so much cover here?

3049
03:25:53,690 --> 03:25:54,470
There's gonna be like...

3050
03:25:54,870 --> 03:25:55,550
Oh, right here.

3051
03:25:55,790 --> 03:25:56,050
Boom.

3052
03:25:56,550 --> 03:25:57,910
Okay, here's the plan.

3053
03:25:58,470 --> 03:26:00,690
Dom, we're going straight in.

3054
03:26:01,250 --> 03:26:05,110
Cole, Baird, you two flank right, provide support.

3055
03:26:05,630 --> 03:26:07,490
Above all, protect that resonator.

3056
03:26:08,370 --> 03:26:08,670
You got it?

3057
03:26:08,670 --> 03:26:10,230
Oh, did you hear in Overwatch?

3058
03:26:11,230 --> 03:26:39,510
you can get banned for someone got banned for seeing noob they like reverted the ban today but like someone literally got banned in Overwatch for seeing noob in chat and then apparently it even works if you put question mark if you put question mark it also is a ban that's a flag yeah something bad you for what the fuck was that looks like they upgraded so once like they died here so many times on insane Yeah,

3059
03:26:39,510 --> 03:26:40,810
but we're eating moves.

3060
03:26:41,010 --> 03:26:43,790
I think so they know something's up.

3061
03:26:44,170 --> 03:26:45,190
Yeah, even when you're invisible.

3062
03:26:46,090 --> 03:27:11,030
No, I think you just need to go up there Yeah, even when you put like question marks, you also get bad Hey That's not for you You just can't be talked got PMA PMA Oh, yeah, oh shit, I headshot Yep, um, they They they went boom, but they didn't say boom,

3063
03:27:11,330 --> 03:27:19,610
but like they killed me in one hit They actually killed me in one hit Thank you for the raid.

3064
03:27:19,810 --> 03:27:20,370
Thank you.

3065
03:27:20,370 --> 03:27:21,010
Thank you.

3066
03:27:21,170 --> 03:27:22,090
Freak me out bro.

3067
03:27:22,310 --> 03:27:23,070
What the hell's that sound?

3068
03:27:23,410 --> 03:27:26,910
It's just the wind It's just the wind right when's the last time?

3069
03:27:27,210 --> 03:27:38,530
Yeah, people saying that they are one shot What the weapon is that one that those aren't drones oh shit They upgraded.

3070
03:27:41,350 --> 03:27:42,490
You think they know what we're doing?

3071
03:27:42,830 --> 03:27:44,430
Well, we're not here to sell cookies.

3072
03:27:44,930 --> 03:27:47,190
I'm a little concerned about these guys.

3073
03:27:47,410 --> 03:27:48,250
They're a little strong.

3074
03:27:49,930 --> 03:27:50,730
I don't...

3075
03:27:50,730 --> 03:27:51,370
I'll wait.

3076
03:27:51,650 --> 03:27:52,590
They're very strong.

3077
03:27:52,790 --> 03:27:53,850
Yeah, they're very strong.

3078
03:27:54,050 --> 03:27:55,150
Maybe not just a little.

3079
03:27:56,330 --> 03:27:57,330
Are you up there already?

3080
03:27:58,210 --> 03:27:58,870
Uh, not yet.

3081
03:27:59,030 --> 03:28:00,050
I feel like it's saved now.

3082
03:28:00,310 --> 03:28:01,510
Okay, I didn't...

3083
03:28:01,510 --> 03:28:04,970
I didn't think they know how to come downstairs.

3084
03:28:06,530 --> 03:28:07,290
I was so surprised.

3085
03:28:08,450 --> 03:28:10,670
I thought they were confined in that area.

3086
03:28:11,010 --> 03:28:13,590
How is I supposed to know they can go down?

3087
03:28:15,990 --> 03:28:17,850
Oh, they're explosive arrows.

3088
03:28:17,950 --> 03:28:18,870
Wait, that's cheating.

3089
03:28:24,640 --> 03:28:25,600
Jesus Christ.

3090
03:28:25,740 --> 03:28:26,900
Okay, I'm bringing my shotgun out.

3091
03:28:30,200 --> 03:28:30,860
Okay, nice.

3092
03:28:34,580 --> 03:28:35,060
Oh.

3093
03:28:35,760 --> 03:28:36,480
In front of us.

3094
03:28:37,440 --> 03:28:38,120
I wish I could ping.

3095
03:28:39,360 --> 03:28:40,240
I'm not peeking.

3096
03:28:41,400 --> 03:28:41,640
All right.

3097
03:28:41,720 --> 03:28:42,400
We're good.

3098
03:28:43,360 --> 03:28:45,500
Why can't we use their explosive arrows?

3099
03:28:47,520 --> 03:28:47,840
Can we?

3100
03:28:48,080 --> 03:28:48,700
No, we can't.

3101
03:28:48,700 --> 03:28:49,100
We can?

3102
03:28:49,360 --> 03:28:49,760
We can?

3103
03:28:50,480 --> 03:28:51,900
Yeah, I heard they're...

3104
03:28:51,900 --> 03:28:53,340
I mean, it's explosive arrows.

3105
03:28:54,360 --> 03:28:55,120
Is it good or bad?

3106
03:28:55,900 --> 03:28:57,320
I'll try that right now.

3107
03:28:59,100 --> 03:28:59,900
There's no crosshair.

3108
03:29:00,380 --> 03:29:01,100
Oh, there's no crosshair.

3109
03:29:01,380 --> 03:29:01,660
Never mind.

3110
03:29:01,960 --> 03:29:02,760
Oh, never mind.

3111
03:29:02,940 --> 03:29:04,080
It's a fucking projectile.

3112
03:29:04,220 --> 03:29:05,500
It's a projectile like the grenade.

3113
03:29:05,800 --> 03:29:05,960
Just Hanso it.

3114
03:29:06,580 --> 03:29:07,060
Hanso!

3115
03:29:09,920 --> 03:29:10,880
Simple geometry.

3116
03:29:11,080 --> 03:29:11,640
Look at that!

3117
03:29:14,280 --> 03:29:15,960
It's simple geometry.

3118
03:29:16,580 --> 03:29:19,540
Oh my god.

3119
03:29:19,660 --> 03:29:20,720
Wait, did he blow himself up?

3120
03:29:20,840 --> 03:29:21,420
Oh no, it was you.

3121
03:29:21,540 --> 03:29:22,240
No, I fucking...

3122
03:29:22,240 --> 03:29:22,460

Oh, wait.

3125
03:29:25,280 --> 03:29:28,300
Wait, where's the last guy?

03:29:29,600 --> 03:29:30,380
Wait, why do you do that?

3127

03:31:40,420 --> 03:31:40,880
Wait,

3150
03:31:44,900 --> 03:31:45,780
are we at endgame?

3151
03:31:46,100 --> 03:31:47,580
Wait, can we just beat this game now?

3152
03:31:48,040 --> 03:31:49,360
I don't even know.

3153
03:31:49,420 --> 03:31:50,260
I've never played this game.

3154
03:31:50,400 --> 03:31:51,560
I only watched my dad play it.

3155
03:31:51,900 --> 03:31:54,180
I don't know how many acts there is.

3156
03:31:55,340 --> 03:31:56,260
There's no way.

3157
03:31:56,360 --> 03:31:57,200
I think we're just halfway.

3158
03:31:58,980 --> 03:32:00,560
I'm pretty sure we're halfway.

3159
03:32:00,820 --> 03:32:01,960
We're only three hours in.

3160
03:32:04,520 --> 03:32:06,460
And most of it is goofing off.

3161
03:32:08,680 --> 03:32:09,980
Oh, two acts left.

3162
03:32:10,080 --> 03:32:11,360
Oh, you can do that next week.

3163
03:32:11,720 --> 03:32:12,380
We're clear.

3164
03:32:12,760 --> 03:32:13,380
Two acts left.

3165
03:32:13,560 --> 03:32:13,620
Yeah.

3166
03:32:14,640 --> 03:32:15,760
And let's wrap it.

3167
03:32:16,160 --> 03:32:16,960
Let's wrap it here.

3168
03:32:17,240 --> 03:32:18,180
Yeah, after this cutscene.

3169
03:32:19,680 --> 03:32:19,860
Yeah.

3170
03:32:24,640 --> 03:32:26,600
So we going back to base.

3171
03:32:26,880 --> 03:32:27,760
I guess so.

3172
03:32:28,160 --> 03:32:30,220
This feels like an end game cutscene.

3173
03:32:32,180 --> 03:32:33,200
Food, man.

3174
03:32:33,860 --> 03:32:52,000
hot food nice want some hot dogs damn i want a hot dog now yeah what what do you mean we still get pat we need to pat this game for two more hours let's go what did they do

3175
03:32:58,220 --> 03:32:59,620
who could have seen this coming

3176
03:33:17,710 --> 03:33:25,650
it didn't collapse it yeah oh Resonator didn't deliver the goods according to Anya.

3177
03:33:25,930 --> 03:33:27,610
We're missing data on hell.

3178
03:33:27,890 --> 03:33:36,490
I don't know most of the network We need a hundred a hundred resonated so what we'll use this instead.

3179
03:33:36,870 --> 03:33:41,370
I'll use it to smash your teeth in how about that Shut up and look at it

3180
03:33:45,720 --> 03:33:48,460
Look those are locust tunnels Phoenix.

3181
03:33:48,640 --> 03:34:01,520
You know, I'm right Where did you find that it popped on screen when I hacked in the files were there You should just pour like molten lava in there.

3182
03:34:03,900 --> 03:34:05,600
You're doxing the...

3183
03:34:06,400 --> 03:34:08,140
Oh my god, you're doxing the locust!

3184
03:34:09,000 --> 03:34:09,140
Yeah.

3185
03:34:10,040 --> 03:34:12,700
Give me a zero point on that data.

3186
03:34:13,020 --> 03:34:16,660
Sir, well, it came from East Barricade Academy.

3187
03:34:17,600 --> 03:34:19,860
From his father's house, specifically.

3188
03:34:20,160 --> 03:34:20,920
Whose father?

3189
03:34:21,580 --> 03:34:23,160
Sergeant Phoenix, sir.

3190
03:34:24,600 --> 03:34:29,380
can still find your way back home phoenix yes sir reroute those choppers lieutenant

3191
03:34:32,520 --> 03:35:15,200
who's that oh who's this random man oh god well i guess we don't care oh the transmission i hated neck things oh they like twisty necks oh they yeah i was like who is he well we i guess we don't care about him him well he wore a helmet yeah he wore a helmet oh seven helmet guy don't wear a hat or a helmet this type of game yeah helmets don't do anything apparently yep damn

3192
03:35:41,140 --> 03:35:52,000
well how we did it swear to god if they just oh my god act for it Yo, we are really close to you.

3193
03:35:52,360 --> 03:35:53,960
Better cutscene, yay!

3194
03:35:55,460 --> 03:35:56,720
So much cutscenes.

3195
03:35:56,840 --> 03:36:01,380
I think, like, if we remove all the cutscenes, we would have played this game for, like, two hours.

3196
03:36:03,680 --> 03:36:04,560
Yeah, legit.

3197
03:36:04,940 --> 03:36:05,560
I didn't think it.

3198
03:36:05,560 --> 03:36:09,180
I think the game would have been two hours without cutscenes.

3199
03:36:09,840 --> 03:36:10,360
All right.

3200
03:36:11,800 --> 03:36:13,100
I guess he saved, right?

3201
03:36:13,580 --> 03:36:14,100
Is he saved?

3202
03:36:14,220 --> 03:36:16,820
Wait, they just fucking put us in a fucking battlefield.

3203
03:36:17,260 --> 03:36:18,300
It's okay, it's okay.

3204
03:36:18,800 --> 03:36:19,560
We saved, right?

3205
03:36:19,580 --> 03:36:20,060
It's okay.

3206
03:36:20,280 --> 03:36:20,520
We saved.

3207
03:36:20,540 --> 03:36:22,320
I think so it's a checkpoint.

3208
03:36:22,740 --> 03:36:23,260
You gotta pause.

3209
03:36:23,420 --> 03:36:25,280
I can't pause the game because I have no rights.

3210
03:36:25,960 --> 03:36:27,800
You have no rights.

3211
03:36:28,140 --> 03:36:30,820
When I pause, you get to keep playing.

3212
03:36:31,880 --> 03:36:32,240
Correct.

3213
03:36:34,080 --> 03:36:35,120
GG's touches.

3214
03:36:35,560 --> 03:36:36,080
GG's.

3215
03:36:36,100 --> 03:36:37,120
That was fun.

3216
03:36:37,400 --> 03:36:38,740
Oh, I have died.

3217
03:36:39,780 --> 03:36:40,800
I'm not lagging anymore.

3218
03:36:41,020 --> 03:36:41,740
I'm so happy.

3219
03:36:42,200 --> 03:36:43,640
I'm actually not lagging anymore.

3220
03:36:44,060 --> 03:36:44,380
Very nice.

3221
03:36:44,620 --> 03:36:44,940
Yeah.

3222
03:36:45,080 --> 03:36:47,920
I was worried because I was actually reading the Steam Reviews.

3223
03:36:47,960 --> 03:36:52,740
I do wish to upgrade my PC, but today, My teeth says otherwise.

3224
03:36:53,400 --> 03:36:53,840
Oh, wait.

3225
03:36:54,060 --> 03:36:55,300
When was last time I went to dentists?

3226
03:36:56,760 --> 03:36:57,720
Like last week.

3227
03:36:58,120 --> 03:36:58,760
Wait, last week?

3228
03:36:59,320 --> 03:37:01,940
So I got like, like, yeah, I got like my wisdom tooth removed.

3229
03:37:02,280 --> 03:37:02,560
Yeah, yeah.

3230
03:37:02,720 --> 03:37:04,040
Oh, so it's still healing, right?

3231
03:37:04,520 --> 03:37:05,300
It's still healing.

3232
03:37:05,440 --> 03:37:05,640
Yeah.

3233
03:37:05,780 --> 03:37:07,360
There's like stitches in here right now.

3234
03:37:07,400 --> 03:37:07,560
Yeah.

3235
03:37:07,720 --> 03:37:09,220
And you're trying not to touch the stitches.

3236
03:37:10,200 --> 03:37:11,920
No, it's hard to eat, though.

3237
03:37:12,220 --> 03:37:12,640
Oh, it's true.

3238
03:37:12,720 --> 03:37:12,840

3281
03:45:18,440 --> 03:45:18,760
Not tomorrow.

3282
03:45:18,900 --> 03:45:21,180
Tomorrow is, tomorrow is Silk Song.

3283
03:45:21,900 --> 03:45:23,400
No, it's back to Hollow Day.

3284
03:45:23,740 --> 03:45:24,720
It's back to Hollow Day.

3285
03:45:25,480 --> 03:45:26,580
Tomorrow is Hollow Day.

3286
03:45:26,840 --> 03:45:30,960
I hope we can play as much as we can for tomorrow.

3287
03:45:31,060 --> 03:45:40,100
We're going to do another long stream for Hollow Day because I want to make sure that, I think I'm pretty sure I can finish it before Silk Song releases.

3288
03:45:40,580 --> 03:45:54,800
I think what I'm going to do is that I'm going to get the, because I know, like, so you guys want, I'm going to see how far, I'm going to see if I can get true ending before, before Silk Song releases, but if I don't have enough time, I might just, like,

3289
03:45:54,800 --> 03:46:10,260
you know, get the basic ending and then do the true ending at a later, like, at another point, um, before Silk Song, uh, but we'll see how far we can go with, with just going through the, we'll see, okay, we're going to do all the requirements for the basic ending,

3292
03:48:09,220 --> 03:48:13,020
I waited until he went to bed before I'd say it.

3293
03:48:13,020 --> 03:48:17,220
I was desperate.

3294
03:48:17,580 --> 03:48:19,800
I was lagging in Minecraft.

3295
03:48:20,540 --> 03:48:22,280
I'm, don't keep playing.

3296
03:48:22,940 --> 03:48:26,760
I was so, I was so desperate.

3297
03:48:27,280 --> 03:48:30,760
I was lagging in Minecraft yesterday.

3298
03:48:31,380 --> 03:48:34,500
And I was just, I just gave, shut up.

3299
03:48:38,960 --> 03:48:53,860
I was like, okay, if I buy a new, if I get a new CPU and a new, a new 5090, then surely, and two more sticks of RAM.

3300
03:48:54,020 --> 03:48:55,560
I have 128 gigabits.

3301
03:48:55,640 --> 03:49:00,140
I think I have like, I have four sticks of RAM now instead of two sticks of RAM.

3302
03:49:00,640 --> 03:49:04,000
And I was like, there's no way I will lag this time.

3303
03:49:04,080 --> 03:49:06,320
I literally was like, I don't care anymore.

3304
03:49:10,720 --> 03:50:27,220
I don't I don't care anymore I was like I can't okay it wasn't just Minecraft I was lagging in Marvel rivals too so I was just like okay there's no way surely I'll stop lagging now surely my skin suit and it's just v2 studios and so it's just because like okay before I would man here was like you know you should like instead of like oh you really should stop just upgrade just just buy a new pc at this point just buy a pre-built because like at this point it might just be easier and i was like you're right yeah you're right and i went to the pc shop i was like do you have a 50 90 in stock and they're like yeah i was like yeah i'll get it it's like it you know i'm already committed i've already i already have like i already bought a cpu and two two more sticks of ram and then I already bought CPU and two more sticks of RAM and I was just like I might as well you know I was like I'm here anyway I'm I'm here anyway I did I was lagging in Marvel rivals with the lowest settings and I'm not

3305
03:50:27,220 --> 03:50:41,180
not in game though it was literally just VTube studio that was like lagging so at that point I was like I was like this is it I have This, this PC is so fucking tanky.

3306
03:50:41,240 --> 03:50:50,400
I could literally run a thousand frames if I wanted to I was like, I couldn't, but it's okay.

3307
03:50:50,620 --> 03:50:59,240
I got, I got a new CPU, a new GPU and two sticks of RAM It's too late.

3308
03:50:59,620 --> 03:51:01,980
I've already committed to this PC.

3309
03:51:02,500 --> 03:51:02,500
I

3310
03:51:07,380 --> 03:51:09,440
There's no way I can lag now.

3311
03:51:09,720 --> 03:51:10,780
There's no way.

3312
03:51:10,840 --> 03:51:12,720
I didn't lag and here's the why.

3313
03:51:13,160 --> 03:51:13,860
We did it.

3314
03:51:13,960 --> 03:51:14,980
We fixed it.

3315
03:51:15,820 --> 03:51:21,560
It might cost me $4,000 Canadian dollars, but we did it, guys.

3316
03:51:22,260 --> 03:51:24,300
Just a little sacrifice.

3317
03:51:24,820 --> 03:51:26,000
We did it.

3318
03:51:28,420 --> 03:51:30,740
There is a way.

3319
03:51:31,900 --> 03:51:32,620
Please.

3320
03:51:33,220 --> 03:51:35,560
Oh my, we did it.

3321
03:51:35,820 --> 03:51:36,100
Yay.

Thank you, thank you.

3326
03:51:46,680 --> 03:51:47,720
Don't keep it.

3327
03:51:48,520 --> 03:51:50,740
Just a little sacrifice.

3328
03:51:51,340 --> 03:51:53,500
It was like, ah, you, it's okay.

3329
03:51:53,600 --> 03:51:54,560
We did it, guys.

3330
03:51:54,780 --> 03:51:55,260
Yippee.

3331
03:51:56,800 --> 03:51:57,140
Thank you.

3332
03:51:57,140 --> 03:51:58,180
Yeah, yeah, Dokey.

3333
03:51:58,300 --> 03:51:59,760
Stick it to the man.

3334
03:52:00,380 --> 03:52:00,760
Just keep it.

3335
03:52:00,800 --> 03:52:01,380
Give it a super chat.

3336
03:52:01,480 --> 03:52:01,620
Thank you.

3337
03:52:01,640 --> 03:52:02,160
Thank you.

3338
03:52:02,760 --> 03:52:03,440
Thank you.

3339
03:52:04,780 --> 03:52:05,740
Thank you.

3340
03:52:05,740 --> 03:52:05,760
Thank you.

3341
03:52:05,760 --> 03:52:06,300
I feel it.

3342
03:52:07,380 --> 03:52:09,620
My longest run was six months and I relapsed due to stress.

3343
03:52:09,720 --> 03:52:10,900
Still trying to quit against the key value.

3344
03:52:11,020 --> 03:52:12,920
Yeah, I hope for anyone that's still trying to quit smoking.

3345
03:52:13,160 --> 03:52:14,980
I hope you guys will be able to do it.

3346
03:52:15,040 --> 03:52:17,920
I know it's really hard because as you have an addiction, it's very hard to stop.

3347
03:52:18,280 --> 03:52:24,440
So I hope everybody, I hope, like, you know, everybody will be able to do it in the end.

3348
03:52:25,160 --> 03:52:28,360
You know, you put just, it just has to be a right environment.

3349
03:52:28,460 --> 03:52:33,760
If you want to, like, actually quit an addiction, it has to be, like, the right environment.

3350
03:52:33,880 --> 03:52:36,680
Because when you get stressed, you easily, like, relapse into it.

3351
03:52:37,380 --> 03:53:09,040
Just like how whenever I relapse back into Marvel arrival is like I usually relapse when I have like the most work to do I honestly know I think I can actually make get all my old parts and Um use it to make a new PC so it's thank you the super chat thank you thank you at this point You have enough for a second PC set up and smarter Parts they give us a super chat thank you thank you Oh yeah and I have to buy a new power supply because my old power supply was not strong enough for a 50-90.

3352
03:53:10,240 --> 03:53:14,480
So, I had to, in fact, this is basically a new PC at this point.

3353
03:53:14,780 --> 03:53:20,520
The only thing that's old was this my hard drive, my SSDs and my motherboard.

3354
03:53:21,140 --> 03:53:23,720
Everything else is just, like, a new thing.

3355
03:53:25,000 --> 03:53:27,200
It's basically a new computer.

3356
03:53:27,600 --> 03:53:33,180
Yeah, you need, like, at least 1,200 watts, so I had to get a new power supply, too.

3357
03:53:36,560 --> 03:53:37,980
Yeah, It's okay.

3358
03:53:38,320 --> 03:53:41,060
Now, now we should, we wouldn't lag.

3359
03:53:41,220 --> 03:53:43,080
Now we should be okay for Minecraft.

3360
03:53:44,140 --> 03:53:46,820
I can't believe this.

3361
03:53:48,420 --> 03:53:49,000
All right, guys.

3362
03:53:49,400 --> 03:53:50,080
I'm going to head off now.

3363
03:53:50,100 --> 03:53:52,440
I want to make sure that I have enough time to get food.

3364
03:53:53,280 --> 03:53:54,620
Spud, thank you all for coming.

3365
03:53:55,040 --> 03:53:58,060
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, pause to check.

3366
03:53:58,180 --> 03:53:59,560
Get them around to get that blood flowing.

3367
03:53:59,740 --> 03:54:02,660
And if you said for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

3368
03:54:02,880 --> 03:54:04,060
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3369
03:54:04,480 --> 03:54:05,200
Bye, guys.

3370
03:54:05,640 --> 03:54:06,080
Bye.

Thank you.
