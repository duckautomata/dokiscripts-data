00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,390
Hello, music.

2
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,830
My brain waking up.

3
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,250
Hello.

4
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,670
Oh my god.

5
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,450
Oh my god, I'm not okay right now.

6
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,770
I was like, oh man, I'm a little tired.

7
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,010
Let me take a little nap.

8
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,890
What's the worst that could happen?

9
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,070
Oh my god.

10
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,890
Oh, I was... I felt like I woke up from a fucking...

11
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,270
Why does this always happen?

12
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,410
Every time I'm like... Oh, so look at that.

13
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,150
I could actually get a cat robot butler.

14
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:36,970
But like, every time I'm like, I'll just take one tiny nap.

15
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,010
Just one...

16
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,830
One tiny nap and then things will be okay.

17
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,770
Things will be so fine.

18
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,350
I don't... I don't know.

19
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,150
I feel like...

20
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,590
What world am I in?

21
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,990
Oh my god.

22
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,260
I feel like I'm like that movie from...

23
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,050
That Disney movie where he's like, here I are.

24
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,890
What movie am I are right now?

25
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,490
The post nap hangover is... I'm fucking... I'm going through it right now.

26
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,790
I'm going through the post nap hangover, but it's okay.

27
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,890
It's Tora but time.

28
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,210
Sumimasen.

29
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,010
Sumimasen.

30
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:48,970
My favorite type of... Okay, so like, I haven't done... Okay, so history behind... I've talked about my history with like crane games before, but like when I was growing up, my dad and I were so obsessed with like crane games in Japan.

31
00:03:49,970 --> 00:04:06,750
I remember like, obviously the crane games now in Japan are a lot harder now, but that back then, like if you say like, maybe like 15 years ago, crane games in Japan were super fucking easy.

32
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,330
To the point where like, maybe like 15...

33
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,810
Yeah, 15 plus years ago.

34
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:21,010
Because like, it was a lot easier to like, when pride... Oh, this is how my brain feels right now.

35
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:26,270
This BGM is literally my brain right now on loop, on feedback.

36
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,170
And you don't even need a sumimasen.

37
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,650
Like legitimately, you don't need a sumimasen people back then in Japan for crane games.

38
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:45,430
So like, when I was growing up, my dad and I brought back, like when we went to Japan, we all we did was just play crane games.

39
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,750
And then we brought back, because my dad, he doesn't care about the prizes.

40
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:58,790
He likes the thrill of it, you know, like people who are like really good at crane games that just they don't play for the prize themselves.

41
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,450
They just love the thrill of winning, you know, so like that was my dad.

42
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,250
For me, I just like the prizes.

43
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,410
So the chase.

44
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,210
Yeah, yeah.

45
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,510
So like, we brought back one point.

46
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:20,150
I remember we brought back like two suitcases full of prizes we won from crane games.

47
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:25,690
And like, some of these prizes, my dad didn't care, fucking care, like what the prizes were.

48
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,910
He just like, I would got have like plushies of weird of like things.

49
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,350
I don't even know what it's from.

50
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:41,750
Like, I just be like, it'll just be plushies of like, like shows or games where I was just like, what the fuck is?

51
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,770
I don't know what they were, but we brought them back.

52
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,910
Because like my dad see like big prize and he'll be like, I can get that.

53
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,810
So my dad taught me how to do crane games.

54
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,150
Because he's like, I shall pass down my knowledge to you.

55
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,190
But then they got harder.

56
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:12,390
They got a lot fucking harder as the years go by because I guess like Japan was like, oh, hey, maybe, maybe like, you know, we should try and make money off.

57
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:32,170
Like, maybe we should start, you know, making money off of this game instead of like, you know, making it so easy, like, you know, they might, I don't know, it was, it was more so like, let's make this harder, like actually, so we don't lose money.

58
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:43,410
So I remember one time, like the last time we actually like spent all our money on crane games was when we realized that they started rigging them.

59
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,270
Well, I don't want to say rigging them, you still get it, but it's definitely a lot more harder.

60
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,730
Like the skill jump just went insane.

61
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:57,450
So you know how like people would be like, oh my, level one is so easy and then level two is like, like final destination, like.

62
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,260
They're just like, they're like, all right, level one, baby mode.

63
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,020
Level two, it's time to learn how to kill somebody.

64
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:19,780
Like, that was what, um, that was what it felt like, uh, the last time we did crane games together.

65
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:30,340
And then like, we just never, we just, we would just like, if we were in Japan together, like when my, my, me and my dad would go to like one arcade and just see how rigged it is.

66
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,120
But like, that's every arcade now.

67
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:44,660
Um, so like, um, it takes like, you know, several tries and stuff like that because it's like, there's like, you know, you got, even if you're like pushing your prize down or like, um, like you have to scout out machines and stuff like that.

68
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,700
But even then, when you're like, my dad would used to scout machines out too.

69
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,220
They're like, he would scout out machines and see which prizes are easily dropped.

70
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:59,800
But even then, the claws or like the game itself is still like not, it's still harder to win.

71
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,620
Um, it's still a lot harder to win.

72
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:15,460
Yeah, for those who don't know machine scouting, some people who play crane games or Toroba, they would scout out the prizes and stuff like that to see, like, they don't care about like, you know, they could, some, a lot of people resell some of these prizes from Toroba too.

73
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:23,940
Uh, uh, and then they just sell the prizes to like the store or sell it out on the sidewalk outside of the, of outside of the arcade stores.

74
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,040
So there's no point in actually, like a lot of people who actually play the crane game is just for the thrill of winning a prize from a crane game.

75
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,380
But you could actually get a lot of these prizes just like for discount and stuff.

76
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:41,560
Um, just, um, for discount just from like outside or like outside the arcade.

77
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:48,380
Uh, and so yeah, and then like, you know, we played a couple of them and then we realized, whoa, this is a lot harder now.

78
00:08:48,460 --> 00:09:00,920
So instead of like winning, you know, two suitcases full of plushies from one arcade, we, from one, like from several arcades, from one arcade, we only managed to grab like one or two plushies, like one to three plushies.

79
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,640
And then my dad gave up.

80
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,540
My dad's crane game career ended that day.

81
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,620
It was like, it was like, it's not the same.

82
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,120
It was, it was just not the same.

83
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,760
The thrill was gone.

84
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,200
The spark in his eyes was no more.

85
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:46,740
Yeah, and then I remember my last time playing like crane game series, not seriously, but like when I still had joy from crane games, like even though my dad's spark was gone, I still had joy with crane games.

86
00:09:46,900 --> 00:10:04,840
And like, it was, I remember this so fondly, um, because also let me know the BGM is okay if it's too loud, but like, I remember this memory so fondly because, well, not fondly at all because there was so much pain afterwards, but I remember it when I first,

87
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:11,380
you know, okay, so it was a Raichu, oh my god, somebody got the fucking robot cat butler.

88
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:33,620
Holy fuck, okay, anyway, so, um, I was at an arcade in Japan with my family and, um, there was a Raichu sleeping plushie, like, that it was supposed to be like an exclusive limited edition Raichu sleeping plushie and it was like pastel color and everything.

89
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:44,880
This is like a flashbob, it was like a flashbob memory for me because like, oh my god, I, I still remember it and I was like, I was like, I need this, it's so cute, I really need this.

90
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:53,540
I don't know how many tries it took me, but like, I sumimasen, I didn't even know what the fuck sumimasen is.

91
00:10:53,860 --> 00:11:03,520
I, at that time, I've yet to discover the power of sumimasen because I didn't even say sumimasen back then.

92
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:17,580
I was just like, excuse me, like, and then he, like, he, okay, and then, like, he came over and then adjusted the Raichu for me because, like, um, I, I wasted so much money.

93
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,860
I, I did not know how much money I wasted.

94
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,940
I just, I just remembered.

95
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,120
I didn't even say sumimasen because I didn't know what the fuck that is.

96
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,500
I just, I was so desperate.

97
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,240
I called an attendant to, like, help me because I was so desperate.

98
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,520
I didn't know the sumimasen thing existed.

99
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,580
That was how desperate I am.

100
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,200
I literally discovered, I discovered sumimasen because I thought he, I wanted him to pity me.

101
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:47,520
Anyway, so then I kept doing it and then I still wasn't, I still, and then he was watching me too.

102
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,400
And he was just standing on the side just watching me.

103
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:56,580
So I still, even though he, like, adjusted the plushie, I was still trying to, like, get it, but I couldn't.

104
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,160
I was, I don't know why.

105
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,540
I just, I just, I just didn't, I just couldn't get it.

106
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,220
And then I wasted even more money on this one machine.

107
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,340
By the way, this was one machine.

108
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,420
I spent, like, an hour on this.

109
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,900
I think I spent, like, an hour just standing in this arcade for this one machine.

110
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,520
Like, I don't even know if it's an hour.

111
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,660
Maybe I'm over-exaggerating because it felt like a fucking hour.

112
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:34,620
Anyway, so I kept doing it and then the tenant, he felt so much pity for me that legitimately I got, I got pitied so hard that he came over, opened the, opened the machine, and just gave me the plushie.

113
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,680
Like...

114
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,700
It's like, enough money.

115
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,820
I reached, I reached hard pity.

116
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,260
He unlocked it and then he just, he just gave it, the plushie to me.

117
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:09,760
And then my mom was so happy for me that she took a picture of me holding the plushie in front of the machine to commemorate them all.

118
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,640
She was like, oh my god, you did it!

119
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:31,100
And then, and then, so you think this is the end of the story, right?

120
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:47,980
Um, you think this would be the end of the story, but it wasn't because when I got back from Japan, and this is where I used to live in Hong Kong, when I got back from Japan, um, I was at home and then my mom was, like, shopping at a market and there was,

121
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,420
like, a, um, a Japan special, it was, like, a Japanese special event in this Hong Kong mall.

122
00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:04,540
And then she was, like, she texted me and was like, oh my god, they're doing, like, a special, uh, they're doing, like, a, there's, like, a special sale right now going for, like, Pokemon stuff.

123
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,480
And then she was like, do you want anything?

124
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,520
And I was like, oh, okay, yeah, sure.

125
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,060
Like, what do, what do they have?

126
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,360
And she took a picture and there I saw it.

127
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,360
It was a fucking Raichu plushie.

128
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,740
There it was.

129
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,360
It wasn't just it, it was, like, other Pokemon.

130
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,440
It was from this Pokemon Pastel Sleeping Series.

131
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:43,300
But I saw that Raichu plushie and it was, I would say, it was definitely a lot cheaper than whatever the fuck I spent on that crane machine in Japan.

132
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,760
Because I was told I was, oh my god, there's Sumimasen available.

133
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,740
Anyway, I was told that I need this cat butler.

134
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:05,580
That it was a limited edition plushie that was exclusive to crane machines.

135
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,760
But I forgot that in Hong Kong, they don't care about that shit.

136
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:31,580
Sometimes in Hong Kong, they would, like, malls because, like, instead of they'll, like, purchase the stock for it and then they'll just sell it because they're just like, well, we don't have crane machines but we do have the stock for these Pokemon plushies from our supplier and they'll just fucking sell it.

137
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:38,460
They'll just, they'll just fucking sell it.

138
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:54,940
Like, oh my god, like, if you find those limited edition, like, if you find, okay, if you find those things in Japan, they'll do, like, those lottery things, like, you know, 7-Eleven or, like, a family mart and they'll have, like, lottery stuff where you do a lottery and then you can win those prizes or stuff like that.

139
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:08,880
And, and then, like, or, like, these, like, items that are very exclusive to, like, uh, prize games and shit like that, you know, like the crane prize figures or the prize plushies, you'll find it in Hong Kong in the store, like, and for a lot cheaper.

140
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:17,840
And it'll be, like, official too, like, it'll be, like, some fucking, it'll be, like, special event and I'm, like, oh my god, you'll find it in Hong Kong, 100%.

141
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:32,140
Like, you can even buy it too, like, you don't even have to do, like, the, the prize thing, you don't have to do, like, the prize thing where you have to, you know, they'll, they'll have it in Mong Kok, they'll have these stores where you can do the prize things where it's,

142
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:44,120
like, a lottery and then you open, you, you go in a box, pick up a number and then see what the number is and the number of, like, it'll be, like, number A, like, or letter, it'll be, like, letter A and then, whoa, the grand prize, here you go, but you can just buy it.

143
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,260
You can just skip all that and then be, like, I just want this and they'll be, like, okay, and they just give it to you, like,

144
00:16:54,140 --> 00:17:17,860
you don't, you don't even, you don't have to do the whole fucking, um, you don't even have to do any of it, that shit, they're just, like, here's money, they're, like, all right, here you go, so, oh, man, oh, and it made me, it made me so sad, because,

145
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:42,080
like, you know, in Japan, I, I thought, I was, like, I spent so much money for this, so exclusive, uh, so, so exclusive, right, you plushie, and then, literally, he shows up in Hong Kong, like, uh, like, a couple of weeks later, I, there's, you can't,

146
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:51,000
there's no, there's gacha, people who gotcha there, it's just, legitimately, it's just a thrill to gacha, you know, it's just a fucking thrill,

147
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:19,880
but you can just, like, you're happy, here's the money, I just want this person, I just want this, all right, sorry, I, I got very, anyway, that's why I remember this experience very, very not fondly, because it was, like, the fact that I played it for so long,

148
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:36,160
to get hard pity, just for to see that fucker show up a couple weeks later, and, like, I could have just bought him, like, I legitimately just want, I didn't care about the thrill, I wanted it because it was so cute, and, like, I was, like, oh my god,

149
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,980
it's so cute, like, and it's exclusive, there's no other way to get it, silly me,

150
00:18:47,420 --> 00:19:18,420
silly me for thinking that there's always a way to get something with money, and that's when I know that that's also the day I learned that, like, that's when I learned how, how strong the rich are, that money is everything, but you can just pay your way for your thing,

151
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:38,820
the things you want, just throw, just throw money at it, that was the day I learned, money is power, I learned, I learned how life works, anyway, I've been looking at this for, like, the longest time, guys, I don't know, like, I, I, I don't know, like,

152
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:54,980
it's, I just, but it seems so hard, like, how do I get the sumimasen, I don't remember how to sumimasen, but it does say assist available, so I just gotta spend enough money, so, like, I don't know, I just want the infra-controlled food delivery robot,

153
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:14,480
it just seemed, it just seemed so silly, like, oh my god, 58, what, oh my, okay, I'm gonna fucking get it, this, like, uh, what, like, I'm just gonna throw money at the problem, too, all right, let's go, all right, let's turn down the music, uh, we don't need bgm,

154
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:32,420
we have our own bgm, I'm gonna go fucking crazy, all right, how do I play this, what is this game, I should have, okay, I don't know how to play this game, okay, I'm gonna figure this out, um, how the fuck do I play this game, did I fuck it up already,

155
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,460
like, am I supposed to get that, like, what is this,

156
00:20:44,460 --> 00:21:08,220
like, like, what am I supposed to, am I supposed to get this, like, oh, no, okay, all right, I didn't need that, I didn't need, that was my tp practice, that, wait, it was this, what is this for, okay, wait, what is, oh, it does B, me and I, oh my god,

157
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:26,160
off to a good start, I, I can't tell, am I, I'm supposed to get this, right, okay, I want a cat butler, though, what am I trying to get, I want, oh, it's B, I mean, it's orange, I mean, they're both the same, I just, okay, all right, let's try again, all right,

158
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:52,360
I want you, little guy, there you go, can I pull, push this, is this pushable, oh, it is, it's pushable, all right, I don't know, I saw a towel, I, I was like, I, I don't know, I, I don't know, I just, I, I see, like, so many crane games where you gotta pick up some shit with these,

159
00:21:52,520 --> 00:22:11,560
like, loops on it and then I was like, oh, man, oh, man, that, that's basically, that, do I pick up the towel, like, like, I see so many where it's literally abuse picking up the towel and I just legitimately thought that's where it goes, oh my god, okay,

160
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:25,420
I, I know what to do, I just have to, I have to push this, it can't be that difficult, it's just legitimately just, it was a, I just realized this cost a thousand eight hundred, I just realized,

161
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:47,460
I just realized how many points this, okay, guys, no, it'll be worth it, I'm gonna get a robot butler, guys, I'm gonna get a robot butler, it's so worth it, oh my god, is she, sumima sending me, oh no, it's just an emote, god damn it, okay, I'll be fine,

162
00:22:47,540 --> 00:23:00,440
I just realized that, stop, stop, I know, stop, I can't, I know you're, I know you're judging me, I know you're judging me right now, okay,

163
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:23,420

164
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:29,640
I'm gonna max out, it's gonna be, okay, oh my god, how do I do this?

168
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:27,330

173
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,530

During Torova of all things.

It's okay, guys.

303
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,740
I'm back in.

304
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,140
Guys, I said I was sorry.

305
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,640
Okay, I like how there's a sleeping bag prize that you can get.

306
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,460
I'm a sportsman-like conduct.

307
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,120
I got a yellow card, but that's okay.

308
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,400
I told him I was sorry.

309
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,760
Okay, I said I'm sorry, so it should be fine now.

310
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,480
I should be allowed to play video games again.

311
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,820
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

312
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:48,460
I just got too absorbed into the thrill of this.

313
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,340
I got too absorbed.

314
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,760
There's a Furby?

315
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,660
Oh my god, wait, that's so cute!

316
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,400
Wait, this Kuromi plushie is so cute!

317
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,960
No, Doki, you have too many plushies.

318
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,560
Wait, is this another plushie?

319
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,160
Is this another cat robot?

320
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,240
Liz, thank you for the super chat.

321
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,200
Thank you, thank you.

322
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,100
Hello, Dojo.

323
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,420
I know you don't really need it, but here's some Toroba funds for you.

324
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,620
Also, Toroba Sasan, do help Doki get some prizes.

325
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,740
Also, Sasan, don't panic.

326
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,760
She did nothing wrong.

327
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,700
It's not like I went to their homes and be like, You're fucking dog shit!

328
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,580
I didn't say that.

329
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,700
I just yelled in my own home.

330
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:34,740
Like, it's different.

331
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,420
I just yelled in my own home.

332
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,460
It should not be the same thing.

333
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,000
Thank you for the super chat.

334
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:42,720
Thank you, thank you.

335
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,720
It's not like I threw a fucking rock through their window or anything.

336
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,860
Like, I didn't do that.

337
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,140
I'm just a little guy.

338
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,460
Vox, thank you for the super chat.

339
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,460
Thank you, thank you for my evil gremlin Hoshi.

340
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,780
Thank you for the super chat.

341
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,880
Thank you, thank you.

342
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,100
I don't know what to get.

343
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,760
There's so many, like...

344
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:10,500
It's just, you know, there's so many choices that you just don't know what to get type deal.

345
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,000
And you're just overwhelmed because there's just so many choices.

346
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,340
Alright, let's see what the new ones are, latest.

347
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,780
Let's look at the newer prizes and see what they have.

348
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,460
Okay.

349
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,820
Oh, that's so cute.

350
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,580
That's really cute.

351
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:29,680
But like, it's also $1,800, so I want something cheaper right now.

352
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:36,760
I need... I need... I need to play something cheaper right now because I...

353
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:42,800
It was a little... We might have spent a bit too much earlier, so I...

354
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,620
I want a cheaper one just for now.

355
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,460
Oh, man.

356
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,060
Why is this $4,000?

357
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:50,840
Oh, my God.

358
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,860
Wait, but it's smaller.

359
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,640
Who the fuck is Little Fluffy Friends?

360
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,840
It's smaller than Donald Duck.

361
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,040
Like, it's smaller than him.

362
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,240
It is cute, though.

363
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,520
This is cute, but like...

364
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,040
Oh, my gosh.

365
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,680
Wait, the... Oh, my God.

366
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,860
The little night light.

367
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,320
The room light.

368
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:15,920
You can filter by... by prices.

369
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,500
Okay, let's look at the cheapest one.

370
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,540
Okay, where is it?

371
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,960
How do I filter by prices?

372
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:22,860
I don't think you can.

373
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,580
I don't see it here.

374
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,760
Yeah, I don't see the by prices thing.

375
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,760
Doki can get really competitive with almost any game.

376
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,460
I wonder how she would do in Hopscotch.

377
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,880
Here's some Sumimasen.

378
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,940
Jen, thank you for the super chat.

379
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:35,400
Thank you.

380
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,440
Thank you.

381
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,520
You can look by price?

382
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,560
Where's by price?

383
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:41,760
Like, what is it called?

384
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:42,680
I'm looking at it.

385
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,040
I don't see it by price.

386
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,460
I'm just gonna look from here.

387
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:48,460
Alright, let's see.

388
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,140
Oh, my God.

389
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,100
Wait, I want this.

390
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:50,380
Wait.

391
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,680
Oh, you don't see it.

392
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,480
It got cut off.

393
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,420
Okay, okay.

394
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,940
I'm gonna show you cats.

395
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,160
I really... I sort of want this.

396
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,520
Wait, let me check.

397
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:12,160
I'm gonna check the others first, and then afterwards, if none of them appeal to me, I'm gonna clean game it.

398
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,260
You'll see.

399
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,460
You'll see when I press it.

400
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,040
You'll know exactly what I want.

401
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:25,240
You'll know exactly what I want the moment you see it.

402
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,300
Alright, let's see.

403
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:26,680
Oh, my God.

404
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,180
The pastel Doraemon.

405
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:29,860
Alright, let's see.

406
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,600
I'm looking at it super fast, though.

407
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,820
Alright, okay.

408
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,660
Yeah, I'm gonna get that one.

409
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,120
I'm gonna get it.

410
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,560
I need this.

411
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,020
I...

412
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,780
I... I need this.

413
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,900
Wait, how the fuck... Wait, is there assistance?

414
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,060
Wait, give me a... Wait, before I go for... Okay, assist is available.

415
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,620
Okay, I... I... Okay, alright.

416
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,260
Somebody do this for me.

417
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,140
Somebody make it closer, and then I'll join the queue.

418
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,380
I'm so stupid.

419
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,590
Why do I do all the hard work when I can have...

420
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,780
C'mon, any Dragoons wanna help me out?

421
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,360
C'mon, c'mon, just help me out.

422
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:30,920
Just, you know, someone make it closer, and then I won't say I'll vulture it.

423
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:31,580
Okay, guys?

424
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,840
I think vulture is such a harsh word.

425
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,100
I'll... I'll come in and... and finish the job.

426
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:38,980
It's like a collab.

427
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,560
Who wants to collab with me?

428
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,180
Like...

429
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,260
Any... Any Dragoon wanna collab with me, guys?

430
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:51,480
Look, I am... It's like a collab.

431
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,540
I come in and finish the job.

432
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,940
Liz, thank you for the super chat.

433
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:57,760
Thank you, thank you.

434
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,440
One more thing.

435
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,180
I typo'd.

436
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,120
I mean, doki.

437
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,120
And do you prefer the ping pong crane game or the normal grabber?

438
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:06,760
Speaking of which, wouldn't it be cool if they added more types of games, including three call?

439
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,680
Thank you for the super chat.

440
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,520
Thank you, thank you.

441
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:13,840
I don't like the ping pong one, because like, it's... It's... I feel like there's more money being spent on the ping pong.

442
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:14,960
Come on, guys!

443
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,760
Come on, Dragoons!

444
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,300
It's open collab, guys!

445
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,380
Oh my God!

446
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,000
I'll even shout you out.

447
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,420
Alright.

448
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,380
Don't worry, I'll go in.

449
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,540
I'll join the queue with you.

450
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,820
Look at that, now I'm in queue.

451
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,140
Alright, how do you do this?

452
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:37,840
Okay.

453
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,320
Oh, he's like pushing it.

454
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,100
Oh!

455
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,420
Okay, you just made it harder.

456
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,320
I swear to God, if you leave after that...

457
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,980
Okay, fix this.

458
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,380
Now you have to fix this.

459
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,020
Now you're nice, you made it more difficult.

460
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,630
No, you don't fucking leave.

461
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,400
You don't fucking leave.

462
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,900
He's like thinking now, he's like, oh shit, what do I do?

463
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,560
You don't leave.

464
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,280
You don't fucking leave.

465
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,560
Fix this!

466
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,720
Thank you for the reset.

467
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,560
You got...

468
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,840
Where's my shoutout first?

469
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,800
Fix it and then you get a shoutout!

470
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:38,640
Fix it!

471
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,620
Oh, you're gonna wait out the name?

472
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,020
You're gonna wait it out?

473
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,800
We all know what you did.

474
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:50,780
We all saw it happen.

475
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,960
There's still another guy in front of me too.

476
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,820
He'll fix it.

477
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,100
We already told you it's a trap.

478
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:01,960
Come on!

479
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,280
Get in there!

480
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,900
I didn't realize it could get worse.

481
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,440
I thought like, I thought that was the reset.

482
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,960
I didn't know this man came in and actually reset the whole thing.

483
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:20,890
I can wait.

484
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:23,390
You think I haven't been waiting my whole life?

485
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:25,150
I can fucking wait.

486
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:30,570
That's fucking right.

487
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:33,490
That's right, know your place.

488
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:38,790
That's...

489
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:40,710
That's fucking right.

490
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:46,010
Oh my god, this guy has a...

491
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:50,790
This guy has played so much Toroba that he has his own emote.

492
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,790
Who the fuck is this guy?

493
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,050
Oh my god.

494
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:56,030
That's a Toroba regular.

495
00:54:56,410 --> 00:55:00,110
He has his own fucking staff that I don't even have.

496
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:01,570
Like...

497
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:04,050
Yuki is the one who waits.

498
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,470
Holy crap, that's a pro.

499
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:12,810
That's when you know he's been playing.

500
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:14,610
Pro, get in here!

501
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,390
I know you're not in the queue, pro player.

502
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:17,990
Get the fuck in here.

503
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:23,790
Curse of Ra...

504
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:29,870
Okay, okay, now it's still worse.

505
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:30,250
Okay.

506
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:43,710
Oh, you are not leaving.

507
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:45,370
You are not leaving.

508
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:48,090
We're gonna watch this.

509
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:52,070
Queuing for Toroba for two hours is crazy.

510
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:54,310
Come on.

511
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:56,530
Come on.

512
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:59,010
He didn't fix it yet!

513
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:03,390
You didn't fix it!

514
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,190
That's not fixed!

515
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,070
It's the same one!

516
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:11,790
Fix it!

517
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:17,130
I said fix it and then you get your shoutout.

518
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:22,410
You literally just moved it the same way, but like to the right.

519
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:26,310
Get out of the queue.

520
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:28,570
The other Dragoon will fix this.

521
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:29,830
Get out of the queue.

522
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,790
Get out of it.

523
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:35,050
All this for a muscle bread bear.

524
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:38,150
Oh, that's right.

525
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:39,710
Oh, you're scared now.

526
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:42,110
You know the other guy is gonna fix this.

527
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:42,870
You're scared.

528
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,570
Stop fucking playing with me.

529
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:49,330
You think I haven't played these games before?

530
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:51,070
Don't fuck with me.

531
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:57,150
Are you serious?

532
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:59,710
That's not even...

533
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:05,490
You just moved it higher.

534
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:09,050
Alright, come on.

535
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:10,710
Put it up right.

536
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:14,830
Alright,

537
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:21,110
here we go.

538
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:22,690
Here we go.

539
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,570
How is this game even winnable?

540
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,270
You sue me my sin.

541
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:29,510
That's it.

542
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,570
That's all you have to do.

543
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,010
Sue, a shoutout.

544
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:37,990
Thank you for the superchat.

545
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:39,070
Thank you, thank you.

546
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,930
I just want to say my superchat.

547
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:43,350
Yeah!

548
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:47,870
Guys, I don't think he's gonna be fixing this.

549
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:49,410
Guys, I...

550
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:51,930
I don't think...

551
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:56,670
Guys, I don't think he's gonna be...

552
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:00,250
I don't think he's gonna be fixing this.

553
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:03,130
It's been like how many turns now?

554
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:05,410
It's been...

555
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,870
I don't know how many tries he's already had.

556
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:10,870
I've lost count.

557
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:12,370
Wait, wait.

558
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,350
Leave, leave.

559
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:15,930
You're done.

560
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:17,850
You're done now, leave.

561
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:22,930
It's fixed, leave.

562
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:23,910
That's the first...

563
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:24,410
Leave.

564
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:27,750
Angriest, leave.

565
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:33,490
Thank you, Angriest.

566
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:34,550
You got your collab.

567
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:40,330
You have redeemed yourself.

568
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:41,890
More fuzz.

569
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:44,190
Thank you for the 10 gifted chips.

570
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:45,670
Thank you, thank you.

571
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:49,010
No, no, no, no.

572
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:50,490
There's no claiming Francis here.

573
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:51,970
He's done his job.

574
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:55,190
He's done his job.

575
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:57,530
I just said Angriest.

576
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:59,050
I gave him his...

577
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:01,090
I even called him by his first name.

578
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:04,510
I even called him by his first name.

579
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:07,450
Not even his...

580
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,730
Look, he fucked it up, okay?

581
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,250
It was already, like, winnable.

582
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:13,590
But then he fucked it up.

583
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:15,990
So, like, he got, he got, like...

584
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:18,410
Look, I said his first name, guys.

585
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:19,710
I said his first name.

586
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:21,170
That should be something.

587
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:25,690
Alright,

588
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:30,070
alright.

589
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,290
Next up.

590
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:33,810
It's my turn to finish the job.

591
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,790
It's my turn.

592
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:39,450
I can wait.

593
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:41,090
I can wait.

594
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:41,150
I can wait.

595
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:47,870
Alright, no problem.

596
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:48,910
It was a great collab.

597
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:51,370
It was a great collab.

598
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:54,690
Don't listen to your dragoons.

599
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:56,850
It'd be all... Okay, here I go.

600
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:58,730
Alright.

601
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:00,430
I'm a little scared.

602
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,170
I'm a little... Okay, here we go.

603
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:04,370
Okay, I just need to push this.

604
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,070
Alright, that's all I need to do.

605
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:08,910
I just need to push it.

606
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:14,880
Okay.

607
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,020
I just need to push it.

608
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:18,900
Okay.

609
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,040
Come on.

610
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:25,340
Don't.

611
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:25,840
No.

612
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:26,480
No.

613
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:27,180
Oh no.

614
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:27,640
Oh no.

615
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:27,800
Oh no.

616
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,300
I fucked it up.

617
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:28,660
No.

618
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:29,080
No.

619
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:29,500
Okay.

620
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:29,940
Okay.

621
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:30,420
Okay.

622
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:31,480
It's fine.

623
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:32,860
It's fine.

624
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,740
No, no, no, no, no.

625
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,920
It's sitting upright.

626
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,100
It's fine.

627
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:37,920
It's sitting upright.

628
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,580
No, no, no, no, no, no.

629
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,740
It's sitting upright.

630
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:41,640
It's okay.

631
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:41,720
It's okay.

632
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,100
I just need to...

633
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,900
I just need to push it.

634
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,080
I just need to...

635
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,540
I need to push it.

636
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:51,600
It's fine.

637
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,020
Alright.

638
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,300
Okay, this is a little bad.

639
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,400
No.

640
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:02,420
No, don't go.

641
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:02,820
No!

642
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,860
Okay, I fucked up.

643
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:20,060
I fucked up.

644
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,720
Liz, thank you for the super chat.

645
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:26,080
Thank you.

646
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:26,660
Thank you.

647
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,640
I love a collab with you, Toki Bird.

648
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,900
I joined Torabun, purchased some credits, and now I join you.

649
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,180
I will let you win after this machine.

650
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,340
Alright, get in here.

651
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,520
Get in here.

652
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,040
Alright.

653
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,220
Our first collab, Liz.

654
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,500
Get in here.

655
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:48,100
If you set this up for me, I'll even say your full name.

656
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:52,960
Alright.

657
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:56,600
I'll even say your full name.

658
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,400
Get in here.

659
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,520
Oh my god, the Toki and Liz collab.

660
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,660
Truance, thank you for the very first super chat.

661
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,020
Thank you.

662
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:09,800
Thank you.

663
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:20,520
Me when I'm a goo goo gaga baby trying to get my $2 toy and Doki is behind me and lying ready to tear me asunder for my lack of competitiveness and power.

664
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,360
Thank you for the super chat.

665
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:22,920
Thank you.

666
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:23,900
Thank you.

667
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:25,380
Alright, here we go.

668
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:26,320
Fix this.

669
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,580
Fix this.

670
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:36,620
I made a little mistake.

671
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,260
Fix this for me.

672
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:42,980
Here we go.

673
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,560
This is it, I believe.

674
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,340
Where is everybody?

675
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,180
Oh wait, they're all waiting for me.

676
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,580
Okay guys, don't worry, I'm leaving.

677
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,700
I left.

678
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:55,880
Alright, I'm in queue again.

679
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,300
Alright, I believe.

680
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:00,300
I believe.

681
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,480
I believe.

682
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,040
Okay, it's gonna be fixed.

683
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:08,020
I made a little oopsie.

684
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,080
I made just a little spot oopsie.

685
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:15,560
Alright.

686
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,280
Are they fixing it?

687
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:18,320
I can't tell.

688
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,160
Oh.

689
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,020
The corner.

690
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:24,680
Wait, what?

691
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,920
That's all it took?

692
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:31,930
Wait, what?

693
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:35,330
You can do that?

694
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:37,430
What a play.

695
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:39,210
What?

696
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:45,570
Oh my god, that's so smart.

697
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:47,950
I don't know if it was intentional or not.

698
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:52,910
I don't know if he actually meant to do that or everything just aligned for him.

699
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:56,500
Okay.

700
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,020
Okay.

701
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,000
Alright.

702
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:00,900
That's alright.

703
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:05,180
Your first pro play was really pro that everything else was cool.

704
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:10,580
Everything else was so cool that you have one free pass basically.

705
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,660
You get your one pass guys after that move.

706
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,640
Alright, here we go.

707
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:23,880
He's trying to grab the plastic.

708
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:25,360
Is that the plan?

709
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,960
To grab the plastic?

710
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,670
Alright, here we go.

711
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:37,650
Oh, what is he doing?

712
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:41,770
I'm watching a pro player right now.

713
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:43,430
A pro Torobu player.

714
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:49,190
Okay, like nothing happened.

715
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:50,170
That's alright.

716
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,370
A pro player gets two passes.

717
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:57,390
That's alright.

718
01:04:58,030 --> 01:04:58,950
They get two passes.

719
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:00,890
Their first move was so fucking cool.

720
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:01,970
Like, that's alright.

721
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,010
I'm letting him cook.

722
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:18,130
Yeah, still on the edge.

723
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:18,990
That's good.

724
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:22,950
What are you doing now?

725
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,250
Wait, wouldn't that reset it though?

726
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:31,360
Oh, wait.

727
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:31,940
The edge.

728
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:37,960
Okay, now I don't know what he's... Now I'm confused.

729
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:38,940
Now...

730
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:45,010
Now I'm actually just confused.

731
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:47,170
Like, I don't know how this guy's brain works.

732
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:50,350
Edging?

733
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:52,750
Is that better?

734
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:56,290
I see the vision.

735
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:58,170
Let him cook.

736
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:00,070
I'm just...

737
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:01,730
I don't know.

738
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:05,190
Now I can't see the vision anymore.

739
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:05,450
I don't know what...

740
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:09,350
Just doing the same thing.

741
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:11,090
He'll follow the grasp.

742
01:06:11,830 --> 01:06:12,390
Okay.

743
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,140
Now you've actually lost me.

744
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:18,780
Now...

745
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:21,700
Now...

746
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:26,720
Now you've lost me on this.

747
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,860
Okay, that...

748
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,720
That was a bad play.

749
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:37,220
Thank you.

750
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,000
Hi Doki.

751
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,820
It's my birthday, and I'm proud to call you my Kamiyoshi.

Thank you.

756

Thank you.

757
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,660
Gigi, happy birthday to you.

758
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,380
Happy birthday to you.

759
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,260
Happy birthday, dear Gigi.

760
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,960
Happy birthday to you.

761
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,500
Oh, oh you gave up.

762
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:02,760
Okay, wait, what happened?

763
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:10,050
He gave up.

764
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:19,870
I thought- guys, what happened?

765
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:24,790
I - it's back to where it was too much.

766
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:28,170
Guys, what happened?

767
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:30,030
What happened to the blood?

768
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:32,730
What happened to the vision?

769
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:35,530
I messed up.

770
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:37,910
What happened to the vision?

771
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:38,970
Where's the vision?

772
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:41,930
Collab cancelled.

773
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:44,530
Alright guys, guys, come on guys.

774
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:45,030
I know.

775
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:46,210
Guys, come on.

776
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,190
How do I leave the queue?

777
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,210
I'm gonna leave- okay.

778
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:51,810
I'm leaving the queue so we can- This will end.

779
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:52,430
Are you sure?

780
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:54,070
Yes, I'm sure.

781
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:55,410
There we go.

782
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:57,430
Come on, get in here.

783
01:07:57,610 --> 01:07:58,670
Where's the vision?

784
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:05,570
Get it- He cooked too much.

785
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:07,830
Mine, it's your turn now.

786
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:13,830
I know some of you are in there.

787
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,490
Come on, where's the vision?

788
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:19,370
Come on.

789
01:08:19,570 --> 01:08:20,910
The collab of the century.

790
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:24,050
You do the setup and then I finish the job.

791
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:28,390
And then one of us will get 100% of the credit.

792
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:30,150
Who is it gonna be?

793
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:31,330
It's up to you.

794
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:34,130
But we'll find out later on.

795
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:39,830
And I'm gonna be just like my oshi, Thomas Edison.

796
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:43,650
And have someone take 100% of the credit.

797
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:48,310
Just like my oshi.

798
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:52,110
Okay.

799
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,010
Okay, leave.

800
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:55,810
You did it.

801
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:57,550
Leave.

802
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:03,510
Whoever you are, I'll definitely credit.

803
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:05,110
You can leave now.

804
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:11,990
Thank you.

805
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:14,370
Snacks, thank you for the super chat.

806
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:15,290
Thank you, thank you.

807
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:16,810
Watching while doing commissions?

808
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:18,070
Gamble fuel go.

809
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:19,270
Your laugh is contagious.

810
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:20,930
Thank you, thank you for the super chat.

811
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:25,410
All you have to do is press this arrow right here.

812
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:26,830
And then you can leave the queue.

813
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:30,810
Just press this button.

814
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:32,210
And then you leave the queue.

815
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:33,570
Come on, just press it.

816
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:36,630
Oh, whoa.

817
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:37,930
You wanna keep playing?

818
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:39,190
Oh, I see.

819
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:42,910
I see how it is.

820
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:47,610
You'll never make it into the big leagues.

821
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:55,270
Oh, I see how it is.

822
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:59,110
You think you will make it without my help?

823
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:01,890
You really, really think?

824
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:06,450
Is it even a try?

825
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:07,850
Where's the shout out?

826
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:09,290
Oh, he has to...

827
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:11,130
He has to leave first.

828
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:16,050
Oh, watch them make it, Doki, please.

829
01:10:16,810 --> 01:10:17,470
Oh, yeah?

830
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:19,570
You think you can make it if I keep...

831
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:20,670
You think you can make it?

832
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:24,150
You think you can make it in this world?

833
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:26,850
I'm gonna keep pressing.

834
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:28,730
I'm gonna keep pressing it.

835
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:30,110
Oh, and then he fucked it up.

836
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:31,410
See, I told you.

837
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:32,610
I told you to leave.

838
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:34,990
Now you'll get nothing.

839
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:37,970
I told you to fucking leave.

840
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:46,090
That's fucking right.

841
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:48,210
You are nothing without me.

842
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,050
That's right.

843
01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:54,030
Don't get banned again.

844
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:56,050
No way.

845
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:58,290
I will get this bear.

846
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:02,290
I will get my muscle bear bread plushie.

847
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:03,590
Look at him.

848
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:06,650
The Doki curse.

849
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:08,250
Don't you fucking win.

850
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,110
I swear to God.

851
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:10,190
Oh, okay, leave.

852
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:16,390
Leave.

853
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:18,850
Just click this.

854
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:20,730
Click this.

855
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,130
And then you leave.

856
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:24,570
Come on, click it.

857
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:26,210
Click it.

858
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:28,370
There you go.

859
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:30,410
That's a good try, Google.

860
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:37,970
There you go.

861
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:38,510
He left.

862
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:43,550
Alright.

863
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:46,110
Now I need the last guy to leave.

864
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:51,110
No shoutout.

865
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:56,610
Alright.

866
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:58,610
We just need the last guy to leave.

867
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,270
And then it's my time to come in.

868
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:04,570
Where's the shoutout?

869
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:05,750
I don't even know who it was.

870
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:06,990
They never...

871
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:10,910
He didn't even try to take credit.

872
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:13,270
He didn't even try to take credit.

873
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,590
He was like, I don't need credit.

874
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:17,210
I just did it for my oshi.

875
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:22,570
I swear to God, this guy comes in and resets the whole thing after all the hard work that I did.

876
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:23,230
I...

877
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:32,530
I swear to God, if he fucking resets...

878
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:34,510
I swear to fucking...

879
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:35,690
You can't leave now.

880
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:37,530
He's a hero.

881
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:42,590
I swear.

882
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:48,170
If you fucking leave right now after that, I swear to God.

883
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,890
I swear to fucking God.

884
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:54,170
He's sabotaging it.

885
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:56,650
Fix it.

886
01:12:58,510 --> 01:13:00,390
My hero.

887
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:01,970
There was...

888
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:03,350
This was a group effort.

889
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:07,750
Fix this right now.

890
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:10,970
Okay.

891
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:14,750
He fully reset the whole thing.

892
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:24,530
Guys, we're wasting more money as a group to get there with this.

893
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:35,730
He actually fixed it.

894
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:41,430
Alright, it's okay.

895
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:42,470
It's okay.

896
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:43,750
He's gonna fix this, guys.

897
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:46,090
He realized, like, he fucked up.

898
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:47,970
So he's gonna fix this, right?

899
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:50,110
You're gonna fix this now.

900
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:52,370
Alright, okay.

901
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:55,430
That does not look like fixing it.

902
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:56,870
But that's alright.

903
01:13:56,870 --> 01:14:00,170
Like, I see there's some vision going in, right?

904
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,150
You're not just gonna leave, right?

905
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:03,310
You're not...

906
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:06,390
You're not just gonna leave, right?

907
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:10,950
Man, what is that brain cooking?

908
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:13,610
He made it even worse.

909
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:15,770
He's not here to fix it.

910
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:16,950
He's here to reset.

911
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:19,130
Wait, this is just some random guy.

912
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:21,630
Like, he's not even, like, a dragoon.

913
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:26,050
He's actually some fucking random guy that just wants to play Torobot.

914
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:28,190
Okay.

915
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:30,790
It's gonna happen.

916
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:34,130
Okay, nothing happened.

917
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:42,090
This is one guy in the sea of dragoons.

918
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:46,910
I swear to god, if you fucking leave, I am so mad at that guy.

919
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:48,810
If you fucking leave.

920
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:55,630
Alright, here we go.

921
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:57,390
It's alright.

922
01:14:58,250 --> 01:14:59,790
Nothing ever happened.

923
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,720
Like, what is your plan?

924
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:09,260
I can't tell!

925
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,640
You just keep grabbing it over and over again!

926
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,620
The same spot!

927
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:16,620
This is like insanity!

928
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:24,870
Like, where's your head going?

929
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:30,010
Like, where is it going?

930
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:31,890
What are you thinking right now?

931
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:38,750
Are your wife and kids taking hostage and this is like the only way to free them?

932
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:40,350
Like, what's going on?

933
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:47,080
Wait, no, he fixed it.

934
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,500
Wait, did he fix it?

935
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,720
Wait, no, he fixed it.

936
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:50,800
Wait, he did it.

937
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:52,460
Wait, he fucking did it!

938
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:55,520
Okay, but like, what do you do after this?

939
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,280
Oh, he did it.

940
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:00,180
He fucking did it.

941
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,000
Wait, this was a dragoon.

942
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Okay.

943
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,880
How do I do this though?

944
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:13,920
Grab the plastic?

945
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:17,460
Okay, if I grab the plastic, I have to grab it here.

946
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:21,060
Okay, wait.

947
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,280
I just don't know how to do this.

948
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:28,740
Wait a minute.

949
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:29,760
Okay.

950
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,500
Maybe if I do it here.

951
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:32,900
Wait, I got an idea.

952
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:35,680
I got an idea.

953
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:37,280
Okay.

954
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,160
I'll grab the plastic from here.

955
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:48,030
Okay, that's...

956
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:48,890
That's okay.

957
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:52,030
That's okay.

958
01:16:52,110 --> 01:16:53,130
I didn't fuck it up.

959
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:55,310
Guys, I didn't fuck it up.

960
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:56,610
That's okay.

961
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:59,290
I didn't fuck it up, guys.

962
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:00,470
That's okay.

963
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:04,610
I just...

964
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:07,010
I'm trying to grab this area.

965
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:08,230
Okay, okay, here we go.

966
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:09,890
Oh shit.

967
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:11,130
Okay, this is a little bit too much.

968
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:13,750
Okay, here we go.

969
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:16,130
I should grab the plastic here.

970
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:19,030
Oh no, I fucked up.

971
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:20,710
Oh no.

972
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:21,570
Oh no, come on.

973
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:22,290
Don't reset this.

974
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:23,550
Don't reset it.

975
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:25,830
Oh!

976
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:27,710
Wait, wait, wait.

977
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:28,410
Wait, I'm cooking.

978
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:29,730
I'm actually cooking.

979
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:31,290
I'm actually cooking with this.

980
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:32,930
Wait a minute, it's...

981
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:33,810
No, no, no, no, wait, wait.

982
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:34,230
No, no, no.

983
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:35,070
It's actually working.

984
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:36,330
I'm actually cooking with this.

985
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:36,650
Okay.

986
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:39,770
Okay.

987
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:42,930
So now, I just need to grab this part.

988
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:43,430
Okay.

989
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:44,830
Alright, I figured it out.

990
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:47,530
Okay.

991
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:52,290
And then, I just need to push it like that.

992
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:56,670
Okay.

993
01:17:59,890 --> 01:18:00,250
Oh!

994
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:00,330
Oh!

995
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:25,760
Um...

996
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:35,480
No, no, no.

997
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:36,520
This is salvageable.

998
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:39,240
This is so fixable, guys.

999
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:40,440
This is...

1000
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,700
I can fix this.

1001
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,580
Guys, I can fix this, guys.

1002
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:47,820
This is...

1003
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,220
This is...

1004
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:49,900
This is...

1005
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,040
This is fixable, guys.

1006
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:53,160
I swear to God.

1007
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,240
Wait, I figured it out.

1008
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:55,300
Guys, no, no, no, no, no.

1009
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:55,900
Guys.

1010
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,140
I figured it out, guys.

1011
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:01,120
I...

1012
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:02,700
I see the vision.

1013
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:04,220
I see the vision.

1014
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:06,860
It's right here.

1015
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:10,120
Okay, that's as far as I can go.

1016
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,620
I see the vision, guys.

1017
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:13,260
Like, it's right here.

1018
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:18,080
And I'm gonna grab this corner, right?

1019
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,660
And I'm gonna grab the little...

1020
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,380
Okay, um...

1021
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:30,150
Um...

1022
01:19:30,810 --> 01:19:32,430
Okay, there is a little problem.

1023
01:19:34,930 --> 01:19:35,370
Guys,

1024
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:41,410
guys, guys.

1025
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:41,910
No, no, no.

1026
01:19:42,090 --> 01:19:43,270
It's not over, guys.

1027
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:44,470
It's not over, okay?

1028
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:45,890
It's not over, guys.

1029
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:46,670
I haven't...

1030
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:48,770
I haven't used up my limit, guys.

1031
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:51,570
It's not over, everybody.

1032
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:52,510
It's not...

1033
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:57,070
It's not over.

1034
01:19:57,390 --> 01:19:58,590
It's not over, guys.

1035
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:01,230
I still have a hundred dollars left, guys.

1036
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:04,530
I still have a hundred dollars, guys.

1037
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:08,990
It's right there.

1038
01:20:08,990 --> 01:20:10,070
It's right there.

1039
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:11,930
No, no, no.

1040
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:13,050
I still have a hundred.

1041
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:16,310
Chat, I still... I still have a hundred dollars.

1042
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:17,590
I...

1043
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:21,950
It's okay.

1044
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:25,870
It's okay.

1045
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:28,010
I still have a hundred dollars, everybody.

1046
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,050
Of course I do.

1047
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:30,870
Of course.

1048
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:32,490
I set up a limit for a reason.

1049
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:34,410
I would never... Look at that, see?

1050
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:35,630
Look at that.

1051
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:38,130
It's fine.

1052
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:40,490
It's fine.

1053
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:41,790
I can fix this.

1054
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:44,710
Oh, no.

1055
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:00,150
It's okay.

1056
01:21:00,710 --> 01:21:04,230
You guys just don't... You guys just don't see what I'm cooking right now.

1057
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:06,630
You guys just don't know what I'm cooking.

1058
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:09,470
Like, you guys don't know the long plan.

1059
01:21:09,730 --> 01:21:10,570
Just like the robot.

1060
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:12,690
Just like...

1061
01:21:12,690 --> 01:21:13,950
Just like the robot.

1062
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:20,010
You just don't see the fucking absolute brain power that I have doing this.

1063
01:21:21,370 --> 01:21:23,650
You just don't understand.

1064
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:26,310
Thank you for the super chat.

1065
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:26,690
Thank you.

1066
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:27,350
Thank you.

1067
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:30,850
I approve of my mini money going to this.

1068
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:33,830
Guys, there's like a... It's a 12-step program.

1069
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:35,910
We're only on step one, guys.

1070
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:43,370
We're only on step one of my 12-step program that you can purchase for only $9.99.

1071
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:47,070
And then you'll realize.

1072
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:49,890
You'll fucking realize how wrong you all were.

1073
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:51,610
Look at that.

1074
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:51,970
Look at that.

1075
01:21:52,050 --> 01:21:52,390
I set it up.

1076
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:52,970
I set it up!

1077
01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:53,750
I set it up!

1078
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:58,550
We're only on step one of my 12-step program.

1079
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:03,730
Right here.

1080
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:10,590
Alright, here we go.

1081
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:14,960
This is it?

1082
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:15,540
This is it?

1083
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:16,340
Oh wait, I figured it out!

1084
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:17,600
I figured it out!

1085
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:19,900
I mean, I've always had to figure it out.

1086
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:20,900
I've always had it.

1087
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:21,900
It was a 12-step program.

1088
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:23,520
I've always had to figure it out, guys.

1089
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:24,880
Like, it was always...

1090
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,540
It was always there.

1091
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,560
It was always there.

1092
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:32,600
We're still on step one.

1093
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,280
We're at 1.5 right now.

1094
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,960
We're at 1.5.

1095
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,560
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

1096
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,360
Thank you, thank you.

1097
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:43,960
I spend my money irresponsibly, so my Oshi can spend money irresponsibly.

1098
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,120
Thank you for the super chat.

1099
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:47,680
Thank you.

1100
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:50,100
It's okay.

1101
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,120
It's okay.

1102
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:51,960
This is it.

1103
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,260
We're at step 1.6 now.

1104
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:56,940
Okay.

1105
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,200
We just need to...

1106
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,680
Wait, maybe I can push it now.

1107
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:09,520
Come on, grab the bag.

1108
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:11,080
Grab the bag.

1109
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:11,820
Yes, come on.

1110
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:12,780
Push the bag.

1111
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:13,800
That's right.

1112
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:14,060
Okay.

1113
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:14,680
Wait, wait, wait.

1114
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:14,920
Okay.

1115
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:16,960
The vision is getting clearer.

1116
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:20,700
I'm unlocking the vision one pixel at a time.

1117
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:26,360
It's just buffering at the moment.

1118
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:30,640
The plan is like, buffering in my head at the moment, but it's there.

1119
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:31,580
It's there.

1120
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:35,640
Okay.

1121
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,100
It's literally...

1122
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:40,760
It's there.

1123
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:43,780
My third eye has just opened a tiny bit.

1124
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:46,160
Let's push it.

1125
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,360
Let's push it.

1126
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:48,920
Come on, just push it.

1127
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,200
Oh, not like that, though.

1128
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:51,340
No, not like that.

1129
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:52,640
Don't push it like that.

1130
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:54,220
No, wait a minute.

1131
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:54,960
That's... Okay.

1132
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:02,550
Thank you for the super chat.

1133
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:03,130
Thank you.

1134
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:04,030
Thank you.

1135
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:06,110
But not like that.

1136
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,010
No, not like that.

1137
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:08,870
Oh my god.

1138
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:09,810
Oh my god!

1139
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:16,320
Come on.

1140
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:17,620
Come on.

1141
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:18,640
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1142
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:19,800
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1143
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:46,410
Oh my god!

1144
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:48,230
What do you mean I have custom stats?!

1145
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:54,390
Why is there a map full of custom stats in my lobby?!

1146
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:55,230
Get out!

1147
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,190
Get your ass out of here!

1148
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:04,130
Get out of here!

1149
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:07,150
These stupid ass custom stats!

1150
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:08,910
Get out!

1151
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,680
Oh my god.

1152
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,120
Thank you for the super chat.

1153
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:19,460
Thank you.

1154
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:23,680
Let's quit before they hit it big.

1155
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,860
Do it to them.

1156
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:30,940
Oh my god.

1157
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:35,570
Okay, I'm doing the corner strat.

1158
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:36,750
I'm doing it.

1159
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:38,230
This is it.

1160
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:40,330
This is it.

1161
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:41,170
Oh my god.

1162
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:42,290
What is this?

1163
01:25:42,690 --> 01:25:47,190
Where is my...

1164
01:25:47,190 --> 01:25:49,950
Why don't I have Tsumimasen?!

1165
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:53,950
The last time I played this, I had like seven Tsumimasens!

1166
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:57,950
Like, does he not see the money I'm spending?!

1167
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:05,770
Oh my god.

1168
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:10,170
Oh my god.

1169
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:11,350
Oh my god.

1170
01:26:11,490 --> 01:26:12,970
Oh my god.

1171
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:15,890
Oh my god.

1172
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:18,630
How void desperate do I have to be?!

1173
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:23,940
Okay.

1174
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:25,160
That's fine.

1175
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:26,440
That's fine.

1176
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,340
We're gonna figure this out.

1177
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:30,740
Okay.

1178
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:34,500
Okay.

1179
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,280
That's fine.

1180
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,080
That's- we're so fucking fine.

1181
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:39,820
We're so healthy.

1182
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:45,410
Alright, now I'm picking it by the side now.

1183
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:50,130
It's gonna do a 360, but I'm gonna fucking flip this before I- oh my god.

1184
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:51,710
For the love of god.

1185
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:53,170
For the-

1186
01:26:58,370 --> 01:27:02,590
I need- I need my muscle big bear plush!

1187
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:08,900
I- when I get this, I will be buried with this plushie.

1188
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,760
Just call the number, Doki.

1189
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:19,680
Thank you for the super very first super chat.

1190
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:20,700
Thank you.

1191
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:25,960
I will wield this fucking bear to my descendants.

1192
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,280
I don't care.

1193
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:36,920
The tomb of Doki will only consist of muscle bear bread big plushie and my fucking cat robot.

1194
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:43,560
Okay.

1195
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:47,100
This is it.

1196
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:48,040
This should be it.

1197
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:53,320
Maybe I can- I'm gonna grab it by this piece.

1198
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:54,960
I fucked up.

1199
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:57,080
I- oh my god.

1200
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:01,340
Woah.

1201
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:03,740
Okay.

1202
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:04,660
Okay.

1203
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:09,680
I got a little too overzealous here.

1204
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:14,740
I got- I got a little too excited.

1205
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,780
Okay, I got- I got a little too excited right there.

1206
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:22,980
It's okay, I'll just pick it up normally.

1207
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,660
I'm just gonna pick it up normally.

1208
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:25,520
Surely it'll work.

1209
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:31,570
Okay, I picked it up at the side.

1210
01:28:32,690 --> 01:28:34,250
It's at the side now.

1211
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:38,250
It's gonna let it go.

1212
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:39,490
And it's gonna reset.

1213
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:41,030
Oh my god, I keep tiring.

1214
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:51,070
You can tell it resetted so I- I don't understand.

1215
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:53,330
Where is he?

1216
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:55,270
Where's my zoomie bot?

1217
01:28:55,510 --> 01:29:00,490
Why would it say assist available and then they just never showed up?

1218
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:02,410
That's so fucked up.

1219
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:07,790
I literally picked machines that had zoomie bots in written on it.

1220
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:10,390
I picked the machines for zoomie bots in.

1221
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:13,530
Oh my god.

1222
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:16,590
Oh my god.

1223
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:17,570
Wait,

1224
01:29:20,990 --> 01:29:21,830
I have a P.O.

1225
01:29:21,870 --> 01:29:22,210
box.

1226
01:29:22,670 --> 01:29:22,890
Wait.

1227
01:29:31,290 --> 01:29:31,610
Wait.

1228
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:32,150
Wait.

1229
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:33,790
I'm cooking.

1230
01:29:41,810 --> 01:29:42,650
Wait a minute.

1231
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:43,690
Wait a minute.

1232
01:29:43,790 --> 01:29:44,710
I have a plan.

1233
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,450
I have a plan, guys.

1234
01:29:46,610 --> 01:29:47,050
Wait a minute.

1235
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:48,610
This is my last- Guys, guys, guys.

1236
01:29:48,670 --> 01:29:50,910
This is technically- Guys, guys, guys.

1237
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:51,290
Okay.

1238
01:29:52,010 --> 01:29:54,490
Guys, let me grab- Yes!

1239
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:56,590
Guys, I figured it out.

1240
01:29:57,690 --> 01:29:59,390
Guys, we're gonna work together.

1241
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:03,610
Guys, we're gonna- We're gonna work together.

1242
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:07,070
Guys, I set it up for the dragoons.

1243
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:07,770
Look at that!

1244
01:30:08,030 --> 01:30:09,530
I set it up for you guys.

1245
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:10,670
Guys, okay.

1246
01:30:11,090 --> 01:30:11,310
Okay.

1247
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:13,770
Guys, I have- Guys, alright.

1248
01:30:14,190 --> 01:30:15,270
I set it up for you.

1249
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:15,950
Okay?

1250
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:17,910
I set this up for all of you.

1251
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:18,630
Okay, guys?

1252
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:21,610
Look, I set this up for all of you.

1253
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:25,750
And then, like, you're gonna win this on stream.

1254
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:30,090
And then, guys, guys, I have a P.O.

1255
01:30:30,170 --> 01:30:30,330
box.

1256
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:37,750
Wait, let me- Guys, I have a P.O.

1257
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:38,490
box, guys.

1258
01:30:39,050 --> 01:30:39,810
Guys, this is it.

1259
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:40,610
This is the plan.

1260
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:46,590
Guys, this is- Guys, guys.

1261
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:48,850
Guys, please.

1262
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:49,810
Please.

1263
01:30:50,410 --> 01:30:51,650
I have a P.O.

1264
01:30:51,690 --> 01:30:52,070
box.

1265
01:30:52,270 --> 01:30:54,610
We can win this together.

1266
01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:57,270
We can- Bro.

1267
01:30:58,090 --> 01:30:58,770
Bro.

1268
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:00,190
Okay.

1269
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:05,870
All you have to do, guys, is win this plushie.

1270
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:08,510
And then, I have a P.O.

1271
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:09,330
box, guys.

1272
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:14,230
Please.

1273
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:15,310
Please.

1274
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:16,210
Please.

1275
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:16,770
I can't.

1276
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:17,790
I hit my limit.

1277
01:31:17,950 --> 01:31:19,590
I can't spend more.

1278
01:31:20,110 --> 01:31:27,130
I spent $200 today and all I got was a fucking cat robot butler.

1279
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:28,070
Please.

1280
01:31:28,210 --> 01:31:30,510
I cannot spend another.

1281
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:34,610
I'm financially ruined.

1282
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:39,430
I'm financially ruined from this.

1283
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:40,410
I can't.

1284
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:40,950
I'm-

1285
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:46,310
Guys, please.

1286
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:51,230
I'm at the negatives right now from this stream alone.

1287
01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:52,890
I'm at the negatives.

1288
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:59,990
I don't even- I don't even make it up to counteract the amount I just spent for this in the stream.

1289
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:00,630
Please.

1290
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:01,830
I can't.

1291
01:32:01,890 --> 01:32:02,330
I'm fine.

1292
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:05,330
Like, I owe money to the Toroba Mafia, guys.

1293
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:10,590
I owe- I don't- I don't know how I'm doing this.

1294
01:32:10,910 --> 01:32:11,170
Alright.

1295
01:32:17,150 --> 01:32:17,830
That's it.

1296
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:19,350
Thank you for the super chat.

1297
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:20,870
Your very first super chat.

1298
01:32:20,970 --> 01:32:21,250
Thank you.

1299
01:32:21,330 --> 01:32:21,730
Thank you.

1300
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:24,130
I got 30k points to fill.

1301
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:26,410
Let's do this.

1302
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:29,490
Thank you for your very first super chat.

1303
01:32:29,630 --> 01:32:29,990
Thank you.

1304
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:30,670
Thank you.

1305
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:33,030
Genki, thank you for the super chat.

1306
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:33,370
Thank you.

1307
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:33,750
Thank you.

1308
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:37,850
You better hold it hostage for at least a personal postcard.

1309
01:32:38,210 --> 01:32:40,010
No freebies.

1310
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:41,730
Thank you for the super chat.

1311
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:42,130
Thank you.

1312
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:45,590
And it has to be from Tor- I- I swear to god.

1313
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:48,830
I will know if you bought this from Amazon.

1314
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:52,310
If you bought this from Amazon and then sent it to me.

1315
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:54,510
This has to be the Toroba plush.

1316
01:32:54,710 --> 01:32:57,750
Cause I know what the Toroba box looks like.

1317
01:32:57,870 --> 01:32:59,870
I know exactly what it looks like.

1318
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:01,250
I swear to god.

1319
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:03,870
If I see- I swear to god.

1320
01:33:03,990 --> 01:33:10,290
If I see that it didn't come from Toroba himself you don't get it.

1321
01:33:12,150 --> 01:33:14,950
Oh, bye from Mikai.

1322
01:33:15,450 --> 01:33:18,970
Sent it without the box.

1323
01:33:19,410 --> 01:33:21,330
I swear to god.

1324
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:29,070
If I see the Amazon fucking box then it's a good thing I saved those Toroba boxes.

1325
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:31,510
Oh my god.

1326
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:34,250
This is not my first Toroba gift.

1327
01:33:34,670 --> 01:33:37,450
This is not my first time winning in Toroba.

1328
01:33:38,090 --> 01:33:39,630
It might be my last though.

1329
01:33:39,810 --> 01:33:44,470
It might be my last.

1330
01:33:44,590 --> 01:33:45,470
I will admit.

1331
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:51,370
I think this- Can we report her to Toroba?

1332
01:33:52,030 --> 01:33:53,290
Guys, please.

1333
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:55,130
Please.

1334
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:58,210
One of us can win this.

1335
01:33:58,590 --> 01:34:02,770
I believe in one Dragoon winning this.

1336
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:04,290
There's no way.

1337
01:34:04,710 --> 01:34:11,270
There's no way that we will be defeated by Muscle Bear Bread Big Plushie.

1338
01:34:11,490 --> 01:34:13,570
There's no fucking way.

1339
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:17,290
Isn't this your money?

1340
01:34:17,630 --> 01:34:25,090
Bro, if I- I wish I was the genius that fucking like came up with like online Korean games.

1341
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:27,890
Like, oh, I wish I was the genius here.

1342
01:34:28,510 --> 01:34:30,950
What's in it for us Dragoons?

1343
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:34,670
I will be buried with this fucking Bear Plushie.

1344
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:36,110
Is that not worth it enough?

1345
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:47,650
I'll make sure my casket I will be hugging this Bear Plushie in my casket and then like it's gonna be an open casket and I'll make sure I have this guy in my hands.

1346
01:34:55,670 --> 01:34:58,030
How does that apply to us?

1347
01:34:58,470 --> 01:35:00,850
It's- It's a team effort.

1348
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:05,090
It's- It'll be like a teamwork thing.

1349
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:06,250
Like, I did this.

1350
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:10,430

01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:11,130
Thank you, thank you.

01:35:11,390 --> 01:35:12,770
I will try to assist.

1353
01:35:13,050 --> 01:35:14,810
I have like 100k loaded up.

1354
01:35:15,010 --> 01:35:16,130
Not like I'll get it, honestly.

1355
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:17,030
I am a noob.

1356
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:18,650
But if I do get it, I'll send it to you.

1357
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:20,230
Honestly, I don't even want anything.

1358
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:20,950
Happy joke.

1359
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:22,030
Look at that!

1360
01:35:22,330 --> 01:35:23,870
Why can't you guys be like Liz?

1361
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:26,430
Thank you for the super chat.

1362
01:35:26,690 --> 01:35:27,710
Liz, thank you.

1363
01:35:27,870 --> 01:35:28,590
Look at that!

1364
01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:30,590
Don't you want me happy?

1365
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:32,690
Stop that.

1366
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:36,990
Thank you for the super chat.

1367
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:38,270
Thank you, thank you.

1368
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:40,050
Alright, alright.

1369
01:35:40,810 --> 01:35:48,990
Whoever wins- Okay, whoever will- If we get this plushie, I will name my next pet a dragoon.

1370
01:35:49,150 --> 01:35:51,410
Like, I'll literally call them dragoon.

1371
01:35:51,490 --> 01:35:53,730
I'll be like, here, come on, dragoon.

1372
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:55,250
I will literally do that.

1373
01:35:55,350 --> 01:35:56,170
My next pet.

1374
01:35:58,450 --> 01:36:00,070
Healthy over happy.

1375
01:36:01,050 --> 01:36:01,490
Hahahaha.

1376
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:09,680
And before I get like, like a mouse, and then it's gone in like two years.

1377
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:13,440
Like, you guys know mice live for two years, right guys?

1378
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:14,440
You guys know that, right?

1379
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:15,800
Hahahaha.

1380
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:18,300
Now you get my attention.

1381
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:22,440
Her next pet, a goldfish.

1382
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:24,660
Don't enable this behavior.

1383
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:25,840
Hahahaha.

1384
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:30,940
Um, what if I- That's so fucked up, Pixel.

1385
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:33,080
What if I keep it instead?

1386
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:35,620
Then you'll just get a tortoise.

1387
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:39,560
If I get a tortoise, it'll outlive all of us.

1388
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,300
So like, what's the point?

1389
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:43,480
Like, we will not even- Hahahaha.

1390
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:48,940
Get- Get a tortoise just to live- outlive us all.

1391
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:51,380
Um, Ivy, thank you for the super chat.

1392
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:52,200
Thank you, thank you.

1393
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,840
Hi- I don't know, Doki.

1394
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:58,860
This muscle bear bred big plushy guy is putting up a tough fight.

1395
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,320
The mortal dragoon.

1396
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:04,720
Come on.

1397
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,160
Where's this dragoon?

1398
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:07,280
Why did they stop?

1399
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:12,540
Why did it stop?

1400
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:15,160
Why did this man stop playing?

1401
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:16,640
What are you doing?

1402
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:20,860
We are all waiting for you for muscle bear bred big plushy.

1403
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,380
Why did you stop?

1404
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:23,820
How long is this?

1405
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:26,140
How can you stop for this long?

1406
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:27,920
How - Hahahaha.

1407
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:30,540
They are negotiating.

1408
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,960
I don't negotiate with terrorists.

1409
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:35,860
Hahahaha.

1410
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:39,100
Our pet rock's still enraged.

1411
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:40,220
Mine doesn't talk much.

1412
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:41,360
Thank you for the super chat.

1413
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:42,380
Thank you, thank you.

1414
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:45,940
Nexi, I'm begging you to stop naming your pets ambiguously.

1415
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:46,900
What do you call them?

1416
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:47,640
Dad, Doki?

1417
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:49,160
It's confusing either way.

1418
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:50,120
Thank you for the super chat.

1419
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:51,060
Thank you, thank you.

1420
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:52,180
Also, call me a throne.

1421
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:54,200
I don't want to get in trouble because Liz is actually my oshi.

1422
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:55,880
I'm just playing an object she has.

1423
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:56,480
But here I go.

1424
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:57,140
Cheer me on.

1425
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,200
Thank you for the super chat.

01:37:58,300 --> 01:37:59,260
Thank you, thank you.

1427
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:00,380
Alright, here we go.

1428
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:02,420
This is it.

1429
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:04,200
This is it, guys.

1430
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:05,760
Come on.

1431
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:07,820
Waiting in line.

1432
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:09,120
They're trying to party.

1433
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:12,620
Please.

1434
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:13,700
Come on.

1435
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,120
Come on.

1436
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:16,400
Oh my god.

1437
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,280
This wait is torture enough.

1438
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:19,640
Hahahaha.

1439
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:22,540

Thank you, thank you.

1442
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:24,400
Oh wait.

1443
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:25,440
Reload the page?

1444
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:27,000
Oh, did they like...

1445
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,940
Has it been playing, but the machine broke?

1446
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,200
Oh my god.

1447
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:31,200
That was torture.

1448
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:32,440
Hahahaha.

1449
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:38,220
This fucking Torobo was like, we're not even gonna let you watch this anymore.

1450
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:41,540
They've been playing this entire time.

1451
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:44,040
The machine just stopped working.

1452
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:48,220
They've actually been playing this entire fucking time.

1453
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:50,800
That's so fucked up.

1454
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:52,800
That's actually so...

1455
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:52,980
Hahahaha.

1456
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:58,620
I thought I was actually stuck in purgatory at this point.

1457
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:00,360
Wait, what?

1458
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:03,880
You can do that?

1459
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:05,020
Hahahaha.

1460
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:07,360
Oh, never mind.

1461
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:07,840
Oh wait.

1462
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:09,240
Wait, he did it.

1463
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:09,700
Wait.

1464
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:10,820
He's cooking.

1465
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:13,560
Uh, Lunimo.

1466
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:14,520
Thank you for the super chat.

1467
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:15,140
Thank you, thank you.

1468
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,040
So we have two options.

1469
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,480
One, we win it and send it to you.

1470
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:21,960
Or we win it and keep it for ourselves and start a hashtag posting it to shame.

1471
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:22,840
Yeah.

1472
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:26,180
Thank you for the super chat.

1473
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:27,460
Thank you, thank you.

1474
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:28,080
Please.

1475
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:29,680
There's only three left.

1476
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:33,600
Guys, I want it to be the last remaining three to own.

1477
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:38,480
There's only 24 people has one muscle bear bred big plushie.

1478
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:40,280
And there's only three left.

Please.

1480
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:42,720
Please.

1481
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,980
This would be my $150.

1482
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:49,020
This would be my robot cat butler was $100.

1483
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,500
And this would be my other $100.

1484
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:53,420
Hahahaha.

1485
01:39:57,680 --> 01:40:02,120
3,600 dragons vs one bot.

1486
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:05,500
Hahahaha.

1487
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:09,380
Wait, that's what we're at?

1488
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:11,620
Look at him!

1489
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:15,720
He is 38 centimeters, guys.

1490
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:18,080
Look at him.

1491
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:24,580
I will make sure he'll be in my I will fucking put him in my office and he'll like look at me and I'll remember.

1492
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:29,300
I will remember the day we got this guy together.

1493
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:33,440
He's so, he's literally so much I will be buried with him.

1494
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:36,460
I just realized how big he actually is.

1495
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:39,220
And now I'm like wondering if he'll even fit in the casket.

1496
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:40,320
Like, Hahahaha.

1497
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,260
He's so, okay.

1498
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:46,060
Alright.

1499
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:46,980
Alright.

1500
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:48,640
He is fucking adorable.

1501
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:50,180
I don't know what you're talking about.

1502
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:53,420
Every ab adds a little bit more cuteness to it.

1503
01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:55,500
Hahahaha.

1504
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:57,980
Hahahaha.

1505
01:40:57,980 --> 01:40:58,260
Hahahaha.

1506
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:00,980
Come on, Dragoon.

1507
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:02,220
I believe in you.

1508
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:05,140
I fucking do it where I couldn't.

1509
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:07,320
Come on!

1510
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:10,620
You can do this!

1511
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:14,180
Accomplish something that no other Dragoon can!

1512
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:24,420
It would be so fucked up if every Dragoon starts buying one of these plushies and then everybody owns one except for me.

1513
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:27,000
I refuse to buy this off Amazon.

1514
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,280
I am not a cheater.

1515
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:31,720
I say as I ask Dragoon to win this for me and then send it to my P.O.

1516
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:34,840
Box so I can pretend I won this all by myself.

1517
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:36,020
Hahahaha.

1518
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:40,660
I am not a cheater!

1519
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:46,080
We need the Toraba Box, by the way.

1520
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:50,120
You cannot se- you cannot fucking order an Amazon version of this.

1521
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:50,880
I will know.

1522
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:52,980
I- Oh my god, he reset it.

1523
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:53,840
It's over for him.

1524
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,060
I will know.

1525
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:59,700
I need to see this- I need to see the plushie in the Toraba Box.

1526
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:01,020
Hahahaha.

1527
01:42:08,070 --> 01:42:10,270
Oh, he did the great reset.

1528
01:42:10,510 --> 01:42:12,550
He reset the entire thing.

1529
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:13,990
Who will win?

1530
01:42:14,230 --> 01:42:19,050
One giant muscly bear or 3,600 Dragoons?

1531
01:42:20,270 --> 01:42:22,690
Who will fucking win?

1532
01:42:23,870 --> 01:42:26,650
It needs to be- Please!

1533
01:42:26,650 --> 01:42:30,330
How could we not win this?

1534
01:42:31,770 --> 01:42:31,970
Hahahaha.

1535
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:33,710
Hahahaha.

1536
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:36,870
I don't understand!

1537
01:42:38,030 --> 01:42:43,730
I- I thought by sheer numbers we could beat this game.

1538
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:49,370
3.6k Dragoon versus one bear.

1539
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:51,570
We can't lose him!

1540
01:42:51,970 --> 01:42:54,030
We can't lose to the man!

1541
01:42:54,030 --> 01:42:55,870
No, we can't!

1542
01:42:55,910 --> 01:42:58,950
Where is the Subibosses?

1543
01:42:59,470 --> 01:43:01,070
Where is it?

1544
01:43:01,930 --> 01:43:04,210
If I win it, your P.O.

1545
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:12,030
Box is getting an empty photo album, followed by a daily Polaroid of it on his bedchamber.

1546
01:43:12,870 --> 01:43:13,590
Hahahaha.

1547
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:14,750
I don't get it.

1548
01:43:15,870 --> 01:43:16,230
Hahahaha.

1549
01:43:18,130 --> 01:43:19,870
Oh my god.

1550
01:43:19,870 --> 01:43:23,910
Thank you for the super chat.

1551
01:43:24,090 --> 01:43:24,830
Thank you, thank you.

1552
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:28,570
And this is exactly why we don't negotiate with terrorists.

1553
01:43:28,970 --> 01:43:32,410
That is so fucking evil.

1554
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:34,110
Go to therapy.

1555
01:43:35,450 --> 01:43:36,170
Hahahaha.

1556
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:42,770
That is so- Bro, we got a serial killer in the making right now.

1557
01:43:43,190 --> 01:43:47,270
We got a fucking serial killer right here.

1558
01:43:47,270 --> 01:43:50,410
That is so fucked up.

1559
01:43:54,950 --> 01:43:56,930
Oh my god.

1560
01:43:57,410 --> 01:44:00,710
Just to show you what could have been a genius.

1561
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:03,990
Oh my god.

1562
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:05,510
Hello?

1563
01:44:06,090 --> 01:44:09,310
I have this and it's shark- There's a shark version?!

1564
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:10,990
Okay, I'll be right back.

1565
01:44:11,130 --> 01:44:12,010
I'll be right back.

1566
01:44:12,290 --> 01:44:16,190
I need to see- What do you mean?

1567
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:17,070
A shark?

1568
01:44:17,810 --> 01:44:18,330
Wait!

1569
01:44:18,610 --> 01:44:19,130
Thank god!

1570
01:44:19,290 --> 01:44:19,550
Okay.

1571
01:44:19,830 --> 01:44:20,910
There's no way.

1572
01:44:21,270 --> 01:44:22,570
There's no fucking way.

1573
01:44:22,650 --> 01:44:23,930
I'll be back, guys.

1574
01:44:24,030 --> 01:44:25,170
I just need to see the shark.

1575
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:27,430
Just give me a- Hahahaha.

1576
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:32,710
There's a shark version?!

1577
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:34,830
There's no way.

1578
01:44:35,530 --> 01:44:36,070
Shark.

1579
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:39,850
Where's the abs?

1580
01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:41,090
Where is he?

1581
01:44:41,790 --> 01:44:42,470
Oh my god.

1582
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:43,210
That's so cute.

1583
01:44:43,310 --> 01:44:43,990
Oh my god.

1584
01:44:44,030 --> 01:44:45,530
That's actually really cute, though.

1585
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:46,810
There's no way.

1586
01:44:46,990 --> 01:44:48,270
He's a fucking liar.

1587
01:44:48,790 --> 01:44:50,110
There's no fucking way.

1588
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:50,950
I knew it.

1589
01:44:51,230 --> 01:44:52,970
I knew he was a liar.

1590
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:55,850
I fucking knew there was no shark abs.

1591
01:44:55,970 --> 01:44:57,250
I fucking knew it.

1592
01:44:57,610 --> 01:44:59,570
I knew it.

1593
01:45:00,090 --> 01:45:00,690
You liar.

1594
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:01,750
You lied to me.

1595
01:45:01,890 --> 01:45:03,030
I got so excited.

1596
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:07,390
There's only one muscle bear bred.

1597
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:09,410
There's only one.

1598
01:45:10,930 --> 01:45:11,490
There's only one.

1599
01:45:11,490 --> 01:45:12,710
Neku, thank you for the super chat.

1600
01:45:12,790 --> 01:45:13,070
Thank you.

1601
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:13,710
Thank you.

1602
01:45:14,010 --> 01:45:22,730
I will win it, receive it, replace the big bear with small bear, repackage, and ship it to the PO box unless my demands are met.

1603
01:45:23,070 --> 01:45:26,230
More lunchbox streams, please.

1604
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:27,990
Hahahaha.

1605
01:45:28,950 --> 01:45:31,010
Thank you for the super chat.

1606
01:45:31,650 --> 01:45:32,810
Neku, thank you.

1607
01:45:33,010 --> 01:45:33,670
Thank you.

1608
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:35,430
Oh my god.

1609
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:36,670
Oh my god.

1610
01:45:36,670 --> 01:45:40,430
Unless the demands are met, the fuck is this?

1611
01:45:40,850 --> 01:45:43,150
Blackmail and ransom?

1612
01:45:43,650 --> 01:45:45,910
How could you do this to my boy?

1613
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:47,390
Please.

1614
01:45:47,690 --> 01:45:50,370
He was gonna go to college next year.

1615
01:45:50,910 --> 01:45:52,170
He had a future.

1616
01:45:52,830 --> 01:45:54,830
He had a future.

1617
01:45:56,650 --> 01:45:57,070
Hahahahaha.

1618
01:45:57,750 --> 01:45:59,990
A man on a mission.

1619
01:46:00,410 --> 01:46:02,750
For this one fucking bear.

1620
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:05,910
We learned it from you.

1621
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:08,610
Comply or he gets it.

1622
01:46:09,010 --> 01:46:10,190
I don't understand.

1623
01:46:10,910 --> 01:46:13,630
Like, this is a fucking lie.

1624
01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:15,010
Assist available.

1625
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:16,110
What assist?

1626
01:46:16,510 --> 01:46:18,190
We've been here for an hour.

1627
01:46:18,690 --> 01:46:19,910
Where is this assistant?

1628
01:46:22,570 --> 01:46:23,930
He was 16.

1629
01:46:24,330 --> 01:46:26,450
He loved to play the piano.

1630
01:46:27,290 --> 01:46:28,010
Hahahahaha.

1631
01:46:31,570 --> 01:46:32,630
Oh my god.

1632
01:46:33,010 --> 01:46:35,550
Not a single assist on stream.

1633
01:46:36,290 --> 01:46:37,490
He's not dead.

1634
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:39,550
There's someone here that's been watching this.

1635
01:46:40,110 --> 01:46:43,350
There's someone here that's been watching this this entire time.

1636
01:46:44,610 --> 01:46:45,950
He's been watching.

1637
01:46:46,590 --> 01:46:48,630
He's been fucking watching.

1638
01:46:50,690 --> 01:46:52,790
There has been no sumimasen.

1639
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:55,190
I don't think they exist anymore.

1640
01:46:55,790 --> 01:46:59,770
Maybe it's not even ran by a human anymore at this point.

1641
01:47:00,190 --> 01:47:01,030
It's all AI.

1642
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:04,630
I would not be surprised if this is all AI generated.

1643
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:07,870
Hahahahaha.

1644
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:12,870
You can do this.

1645
01:47:13,250 --> 01:47:14,690
You can do this.

1646
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:17,050
We've been stuck here for so long.

1647
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:19,230
Where are you?

1648
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:22,730
I just...

1649
01:47:22,730 --> 01:47:24,010
I just want...

1650
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:27,990
I just want Muscle Bear Bread Big Fleshy.

1651
01:47:29,070 --> 01:47:31,590
Is that too much to ask for?

1652
01:47:32,310 --> 01:47:34,230
Muscle Bear Bread Big Fleshy.

1653
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:38,510
Thank you for the raid.

1654
01:47:38,810 --> 01:47:39,130
Thank you.

1655
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:41,790
We're stuck in hell right now.

1656
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:43,870
We're stuck in this purgatory.

1657
01:47:44,630 --> 01:47:50,490
I think collectively as a team, we have spent like at least $500.

1658
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:53,170
$300 for this one big bear.

1659
01:47:55,090 --> 01:47:55,550
Hahahahaha.

1660
01:47:56,810 --> 01:48:01,850
$300 collectively as a team for this fucking bear.

1661
01:48:02,090 --> 01:48:04,070
Oh my God.

1662
01:48:08,230 --> 01:48:10,370
As a team effort.

1663
01:48:12,030 --> 01:48:14,350
This is Elden Ring IRL.

1664
01:48:14,770 --> 01:48:17,110
The Unforgiving Crane Game.

1665
01:48:17,570 --> 01:48:19,190
This is so sad.

1666
01:48:19,790 --> 01:48:24,210
Guys, but it will feel so good when we win it, guys.

1667
01:48:24,370 --> 01:48:26,190
It'll feel so good.

1668
01:48:26,890 --> 01:48:29,230
Sam, welcome to the Tomato Farm.

1669
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:30,430
Welcome, welcome.

1670
01:48:31,590 --> 01:48:33,010
Wait, wait, wait.

1671
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:34,130
He has a plan?

1672
01:48:34,650 --> 01:48:36,370
I'm seeing a vision right now.

1673
01:48:38,890 --> 01:48:40,830
Guys, we can't lose to him.

1674
01:48:41,290 --> 01:48:43,590
We can't fucking lose to the man.

1675
01:48:43,950 --> 01:48:46,130
We can't lose to Big Corpa.

1676
01:48:46,490 --> 01:48:53,690
Guys, us taking down one muscle bear bred big plushie from Corpa is a victory.

1677
01:48:55,310 --> 01:48:59,530
We basically are taking them down one plush at a time.

1678
01:48:59,990 --> 01:49:02,850
We can't We can't lose to them.

1679
01:49:04,410 --> 01:49:07,050
Come on, Draco, you're so strong!

1680
01:49:08,430 --> 01:49:09,670
Oh, he reset it.

1681
01:49:09,670 --> 01:49:10,210
Fuck!

1682
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:20,200
How long do we have to be here until one of us wins?

1683
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:25,740
How long do we have to be here until one of us wins?

1684
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:32,020
Oh my God.

1685
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:38,500
Maybe let's just try the right one.

1686
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:41,100
I need a hero.

1687
01:49:41,620 --> 01:49:44,120
Somebody assume we need a hero.

1688
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:47,140
We need a hero!

1689
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:50,800
Send us your strongest Toraba players!

1690
01:49:57,010 --> 01:50:00,450
Send us your strongest Toraba players!

1691
01:50:01,270 --> 01:50:03,150
There has to be one of you!

1692
01:50:05,070 --> 01:50:09,890
John Toraba and the Dracoons are the only winners in this stream.

1693
01:50:14,270 --> 01:50:15,530
Where are they?

1694
01:50:16,090 --> 01:50:18,130
Where are my Toraba gamers?

1695
01:50:18,430 --> 01:50:19,850
I know you guys exist.

1696
01:50:20,010 --> 01:50:22,170
You literally showed me your custom stamps.

1697
01:50:22,490 --> 01:50:25,290
I literally saw all your custom stamps.

1698
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:26,630
You think I don't know this?

1699
01:50:26,770 --> 01:50:27,890
I know you're lurking.

1700
01:50:28,150 --> 01:50:30,290
You sent your custom stamp and I knew it was over.

1701
01:50:30,410 --> 01:50:31,990
I knew you existed in my world.

1702
01:50:31,990 --> 01:50:32,030
I knew that.

1703
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:37,790
I knew you were out here.

1704
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:43,600
Okay.

1705
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:44,480
Okay.

1706
01:50:45,620 --> 01:50:48,140
Oh my god, it got me so good.

1707
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:50,140
It got me dead.

1708
01:50:52,700 --> 01:50:55,020
Tokyo stamps are free daily?

1709
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:57,100
That means you're a regular!

1710
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:00,160
That's when I know!

1711
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:03,040
You are a fucking regular!

1712
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:07,700
How did you know the stamps are free daily?

1713
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:10,820
Someone's been claiming those stamps every day!

1714
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:15,880
Oh my god.

1715
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:18,400
This is actual torture.

1716
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:21,420
But we still don't have a Sumimasen.

1717
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:26,460
We still don't have a Sumimasen.

1718
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:32,900
We...

1719
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:37,420
I swear, I think collectively we're gonna spend $500 on this one machine.

1720
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:42,880
You're gonna be like, wow, Muscle Bear Bread Big Plushie has been really popular today.

1721
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:51,740
Thank you for the super chat.

1722
01:51:51,820 --> 01:51:52,180
Thank you.

1723
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:56,440
The last time I tried a Korean game for you, I had a Godzilla Sumimasen.

1724
01:51:56,440 --> 01:52:01,980
I had a Snickers night from my efforts and then I said an Akasupa on apex paper.

1725
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:05,100
I'm gonna sit this one out.

1726
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:08,780
Thank you for the Akasupa Lord Kurosis.

1727
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:09,360
Thank you.

1728
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:11,120
Oh, I remember that.

1729
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:19,880
We worked so hard setting the entire thing up and then the guy in front of me just took the thing.

1730
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:24,260
The guy in front of me fucking just took the slipper.

1731
01:52:31,590 --> 01:52:32,530
It's okay.

1732
01:52:33,870 --> 01:52:34,990
It's just...

1733
01:52:34,990 --> 01:52:37,250
Life can be just so cruel.

1734
01:52:38,350 --> 01:52:40,730
This music is basically how I feel right now.

1735
01:54:14,970 --> 01:54:16,730
Please come home.

1736
01:54:16,750 --> 01:54:19,290
Your family miss you.

1737
01:54:20,490 --> 01:54:22,010
Come home.

1738
01:54:25,570 --> 01:54:28,330
Oh my god, please.

1739
01:54:28,550 --> 01:54:31,250
Your family miss you.

1740
01:54:31,710 --> 01:54:33,670
Please come home.

1741
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:39,830
Come back to us, Muscle Ben, Ben, Big Flushy.

1742
01:54:42,530 --> 01:54:44,810
Welcome to the tour of us, sir.

1743
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:47,350
It's okay.

1744
01:54:48,450 --> 01:54:49,230
It's okay.

1745
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:49,790
It's okay.

1746
01:54:49,790 --> 01:54:50,210
I believe.

1747
01:54:50,850 --> 01:54:52,230
I fucking believe.

1748
01:54:53,270 --> 01:54:55,270
Imagination Arts, thank you for the superchat.

1749
01:54:55,350 --> 01:54:56,050
Thank you, thank you.

1750
01:54:56,310 --> 01:55:00,630
How could this be both painful to watch and great content at the same time?

1751
01:55:00,830 --> 01:55:01,710
Thank you for the superchat.

1752
01:55:01,850 --> 01:55:02,850
Thank you, thank you.

1753
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:05,870
Lappybud, thank you for the superchat.

1754
01:55:06,050 --> 01:55:06,850
Thank you, thank you.

1755
01:55:07,010 --> 01:55:08,990
How does it keep going back and forth?

1756
01:55:09,330 --> 01:55:11,330
I feel like I'm stuck in hell.

1757
01:55:11,330 --> 01:55:12,890
I don't see a cloud.

1758
01:55:13,330 --> 01:55:16,810
It just, it just, just keeps going back and forth.

1759
01:55:17,310 --> 01:55:18,770
It just never stops.

1760
01:55:19,070 --> 01:55:21,430
It just never stops.

1761
01:55:22,490 --> 01:55:23,970
LaffyPud, thank you for the superchat.

1762
01:55:24,110 --> 01:55:24,810
Thank you, thank you.

1763
01:55:25,130 --> 01:55:26,150
I'll spot you fam.

1764
01:55:26,330 --> 01:55:28,210
I know of a really good packaging material.

1765
01:55:28,430 --> 01:55:29,590
Pink sauce drowning it.

1766
01:55:29,630 --> 01:55:31,870
One shirt survives to your PO box.

1767
01:55:32,270 --> 01:55:33,370
Maybe it washes out.

1768
01:55:33,530 --> 01:55:34,530
Thank you for the superchat.

1769
01:55:34,710 --> 01:55:35,890
Thank you, thank you.

1770
01:55:36,910 --> 01:55:38,490
Anton, thank you for the superchat.

1771
01:55:38,670 --> 01:55:39,650
Thank you, thank you.

1772
01:55:39,650 --> 01:55:43,530
Rico, at this rate you can buy your own crane game.

1773
01:55:43,630 --> 01:55:48,470
I'm gonna buy a crane machine, and then I'm gonna set it up just- I'm gonna be its competitor.

1774
01:55:48,790 --> 01:55:52,990
I will create my own crane game tour of a- I'm gonna fucking do it.

1775
01:55:53,270 --> 01:55:58,930
If- if MoistCritical can create his own crane game machine, I can create my own crane game machine.

1776
01:55:59,090 --> 01:56:00,850
I'm- I'm fucking- I'm doing it.

1777
01:56:00,970 --> 01:56:02,610
I will be your next competitor.

1778
01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:05,030
You pissed off the wrong person.

1779
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:05,130
I did.

1780
01:56:05,450 --> 01:56:11,530
I- I'm gonna- I'm gonna start my own crane game business.

1781
01:56:15,830 --> 01:56:17,230
I'm gonna fucking do it.

1782
01:56:17,490 --> 01:56:18,510
I'm gonna be- gonna do it.

1783
01:56:18,690 --> 01:56:20,230
I'll make sure you run out of business.

1784
01:56:20,430 --> 01:56:23,710
And then I'll do competitive pricing, so you're fucked.

1785
01:56:24,970 --> 01:56:29,430
And then I'm gonna go sponsor all these big streamers to play my game.

1786
01:56:29,610 --> 01:56:33,630
And then it's over for you Toro, but it's fucking over for you.

1787
01:56:38,430 --> 01:56:45,150
I'm gonna- I'm gonna grab all these big streamers, and I'm gonna pay them to play my better- my website.

1788
01:56:45,470 --> 01:56:49,450
It might not be better than yours, but then I'll be a competition.

1789
01:56:52,350 --> 01:56:58,110
That's a perfect- He reset it perfectly in the center.

1790
01:56:58,470 --> 01:57:00,070
He actually did.

1791
01:57:01,690 --> 01:57:03,570
Eeyore, thank you for your super chat.

1792
01:57:03,650 --> 01:57:04,450
Thank you, thank you.

1793
01:57:04,450 --> 01:57:05,810
Why are we here?

1794
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:07,570
It's just to suffer.

1795
01:57:10,190 --> 01:57:10,750
Oh,

1796
01:57:14,350 --> 01:57:14,750
how?

1797
01:57:15,170 --> 01:57:21,110
This guy has been on this machine for at least- I'm pretty sure he's been at it for 50,000 points.

1798
01:57:21,230 --> 01:57:22,010
There's no way.

1799
01:57:22,370 --> 01:57:24,590
And the guy has not come to help us.

1800
01:57:24,930 --> 01:57:27,150
Like, nobody has come in to help us.

1801
01:57:29,450 --> 01:57:30,770
Oh my god.

1802
01:57:32,590 --> 01:57:35,290
I'm looking at the ToroBus subreddit while we-

1803
01:57:39,770 --> 01:57:44,800
I'm looking at the Toro- I'm looking at the ToroBus subreddit.

1804
01:57:45,710 --> 01:57:49,770
There's no- There's no way.

1805
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:52,230
There's no way.

1806
01:57:52,570 --> 01:58:01,270
Has anybody- Has anybody won MuscleBreadBigPlushie?

1807
01:58:02,870 --> 01:58:05,170
Big Plushie ToroBus.

1808
01:58:05,690 --> 01:58:07,050
There's no way.

1809
01:58:07,550 --> 01:58:09,710
There's no fucking way.

1810
01:58:09,950 --> 01:58:14,650
Fucking Michelle ToroBus win MuscleBread- We're gonna analyze this together.

1811
01:58:15,190 --> 01:58:22,570
We're gonna- That's not even- That's not even the same game I just played.

1812
01:58:22,830 --> 01:58:27,870
That's not- That's not even the same game that I played.

1813
01:58:29,150 --> 01:58:30,650
I don't understand.

1814
01:58:31,250 --> 01:58:34,130
I don't- How did you win this?

1815
01:58:34,750 --> 01:58:37,350
I- I don't understand.

1816
01:58:38,230 --> 01:58:38,790
Okay, Shelly.

1817
01:58:39,370 --> 01:58:40,790
Wait, they've done this before?

1818
01:58:41,130 --> 01:58:44,270
There was a different game for this two weeks ago?

1819
01:58:44,650 --> 01:58:47,470
Like, how- Why did they do this to me?

1820
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:48,350
Why-

1821
01:58:51,650 --> 01:58:54,710
They did a different game for this guy.

1822
01:58:56,250 --> 01:58:59,850
Why- Why did we get the harder game?

1823
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:03,350
Oh my god.

1824
01:59:04,950 --> 01:59:06,350
Please, I believe.

1825
01:59:06,650 --> 01:59:08,770
We're- We're- Oh my god, you said it's perfect.

1826
01:59:08,910 --> 01:59:10,330
It's such a perfect setup.

1827
01:59:14,410 --> 01:59:15,850
Oh my god.

1828
01:59:16,130 --> 01:59:19,290
24 people has won- It's not impossible.

1829
01:59:20,050 --> 01:59:22,470
24 people have won this.

1830
01:59:25,370 --> 01:59:26,390
There's no way.

1831
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:28,450
It's not impossible.

1832
01:59:29,170 --> 01:59:31,250
There's the 24 winners.

1833
01:59:33,510 --> 01:59:34,690
Come on, push it down.

1834
01:59:35,410 --> 01:59:36,150
Push it down.

1835
01:59:37,710 --> 01:59:38,930
Can you even push this?

1836
01:59:39,170 --> 01:59:39,950
Don't reset it.

1837
01:59:40,150 --> 01:59:42,810
I swear to god, don't you fucking reset- You can do this.

1838
01:59:43,050 --> 01:59:43,750
Don't reset it.

1839
01:59:43,810 --> 01:59:44,590
This is your moment.

1840
01:59:44,910 --> 01:59:46,110
Oh my god, he fucked it up.

1841
01:59:46,190 --> 01:59:47,310
There's no way he fucked it up.

1842
01:59:47,370 --> 01:59:48,170
He already fucked it up.

1843
01:59:48,430 --> 01:59:51,750
There's no way he- Oh my god, he fucked it up.

1844
01:59:58,650 --> 02:00:04,730
I'm- I'm sending this because I'm worried how close you are to crashing out.

1845
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:09,590
Red, thank you for the magenta suit.

1846
02:00:12,510 --> 02:00:16,630
Gee, guys, I think Toki's starting to lose her mind.

1847
02:00:17,090 --> 02:00:18,410
Thank you for the super chat.

1848
02:00:18,530 --> 02:00:19,010
Thank you.

1849
02:00:19,010 --> 02:00:19,610
Thank you.

1850
02:00:19,930 --> 02:00:22,250
Your mom, thank you for the super chat.

1851
02:00:22,410 --> 02:00:22,770
Thank you.

1852
02:00:22,950 --> 02:00:23,910
Thank you.

1853
02:00:23,990 --> 02:00:24,690
I don't understand.

1854
02:00:27,090 --> 02:00:27,690
How?

1855
02:00:28,130 --> 02:00:29,270
How is this impossible?

1856
02:00:29,790 --> 02:00:30,210
How?

1857
02:00:30,490 --> 02:00:33,970
Like, how did the other 24 people win this?

1858
02:00:34,350 --> 02:00:39,470
One guy has basically spent their life savings trying to fucking get the muscle bear bread big plushie.

1859
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:44,930
Oh my god.

1860
02:00:45,710 --> 02:00:48,050
Oh my god.

1861
02:00:48,430 --> 02:00:50,890
Oh wait, I'm not supposed to make that joke.

1862
02:00:51,030 --> 02:00:53,050
I was going to say who created this website.

1863
02:00:53,490 --> 02:00:55,390
Oh my god.

1864
02:00:59,210 --> 02:01:01,150
Rika, thank you for the super chat.

1865
02:01:01,330 --> 02:01:01,770
Thank you.

1866
02:01:01,850 --> 02:01:02,510
Thank you.

1867
02:01:02,690 --> 02:01:09,910
An online game full of YouTuber plushies will probably make fat stacks.

1868
02:01:10,350 --> 02:01:12,250
Thank you for the super chat.

1869
02:01:12,410 --> 02:01:12,930
Thank you.

1870
02:01:13,050 --> 02:01:13,710
Thank you.

1871
02:01:17,230 --> 02:01:18,610
Oh my god.

1872
02:01:19,950 --> 02:01:21,610
Oh my god, I'm going to be your competition.

1873
02:01:21,890 --> 02:01:24,650
I'm going to create- I will be your competitor.

1874
02:01:25,150 --> 02:01:28,330
I'm fucking- I'm throwing out the 3D studio.

1875
02:01:28,730 --> 02:01:31,650
I'm throwing out the VTuber competitor 3D studio.

1876
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:36,670
I'm going to fucking create a competitive crane game online website now.

1877
02:01:36,930 --> 02:01:40,690
I'm going to save up my money and I'm going for you, Tora.

1878
02:01:40,690 --> 02:01:44,530
You cannot hold the monopoly on online crane game.

1879
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:48,430
There's no- I refuse to let you own this monopoly.

1880
02:01:48,770 --> 02:01:50,470
I'm fucking- oh my god.

1881
02:01:50,590 --> 02:01:52,930
And then I'm going to get like collabs.

1882
02:01:53,050 --> 02:01:57,410
I'm going to try and get like collabs with like other famous- I'm going to be like Fortnite.

1883
02:01:57,830 --> 02:02:03,930
And I'm going to create exclusive merch that's just dedicated to like my website.

1884
02:02:04,090 --> 02:02:05,030
And you're fucked.

1885
02:02:05,490 --> 02:02:06,830
It's over for you.

1886
02:02:06,990 --> 02:02:08,330
And it'll be cheaper.

1887
02:02:10,030 --> 02:02:10,870
That's right.

1888
02:02:11,030 --> 02:02:13,470
It's going to be fucking cheaper too.

1889
02:02:13,850 --> 02:02:18,430
I- I'll make sure everyday people will get 5 plays everyday.

1890
02:02:18,990 --> 02:02:28,190
So then it'll like suck them in and then slowly I'll be like 5 plays to 4 plays to 3 plays to 2 and then 1.

1891
02:02:28,330 --> 02:02:32,490
And then 1 free play every week and then 1 free play every other month.

1892
02:02:32,650 --> 02:02:33,270
But it's over.

1893
02:02:33,430 --> 02:02:35,470
I already got them addicted to my website.

1894
02:02:35,670 --> 02:02:37,130
It's going to be fucking over.

1895
02:02:40,170 --> 02:02:42,550
Wait, is my thing unsponsored?

1896
02:02:42,710 --> 02:02:43,470
This is not sponsored.

1897
02:02:44,750 --> 02:02:47,430
This stream is not sponsored.

1898
02:02:48,130 --> 02:02:51,290
Did I actually click the sponsor?

1899
02:02:55,890 --> 02:02:58,510
Oh my god, I'm going crazy.

1900
02:02:58,730 --> 02:03:00,530
I'm going crazy.

1901
02:03:05,510 --> 02:03:08,470
I'm so- You're so weird.

1902
02:03:09,230 --> 02:03:10,870
Oh my god.

1903
02:03:11,770 --> 02:03:15,670
I'm going to make sure that I didn't check that this is sponsored.

1904
02:03:16,230 --> 02:03:17,170
Okay, it's not.

1905
02:03:17,310 --> 02:03:17,990
This is not.

1906
02:03:18,150 --> 02:03:21,890
Oh my god, this is never- I don't think they're ever going to be sponsoring me.

1907
02:03:21,890 --> 02:03:27,530
Oh my god.

1908
02:03:27,610 --> 02:03:32,350
I don't think they're ever going to sponsor me after my fucking crash out.

1909
02:03:33,090 --> 02:03:34,690
Tsunami, thank you for the super chat.

1910
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:35,870
Thank you, thank you.

1911
02:03:37,130 --> 02:03:39,370
I've seen this box at every angle.

1912
02:03:39,770 --> 02:03:42,430
Someone make it make sense.

1913
02:03:42,850 --> 02:03:44,390
Thank you for the super chat.

1914
02:03:44,530 --> 02:03:45,530
Thank you, thank you.

1915
02:03:45,530 --> 02:03:47,970
I've seen this box at every angle.

1916
02:03:48,330 --> 02:03:52,990
Instead of 360, flipped, back, forth, left, right.

1917
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:54,910
Like, I don't understand.

1918
02:03:55,810 --> 02:03:57,550
I actually don't understand.

1919
02:03:57,990 --> 02:03:59,290
How do you win this?

1920
02:03:59,530 --> 02:04:02,410
How did 24 people win this game?

1921
02:04:02,850 --> 02:04:10,950
Like, this man has spent at least 50k TP points and we still have no Sumimasen.

1922
02:04:11,170 --> 02:04:14,390
How do we not have a Sumimasen after that?

1923
02:04:14,390 --> 02:04:16,030
I don't mind.

1924
02:04:21,310 --> 02:04:23,210
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

1925
02:04:23,530 --> 02:04:24,690
Thank you, thank you.

1926
02:04:37,530 --> 02:04:39,710
Thank you for the super chat.

1927
02:04:39,830 --> 02:04:41,070
Thank you, thank you.

1928
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:42,870
Thank you for the super chat.

1929
02:04:42,990 --> 02:04:43,890
Thank you, thank you.

1930
02:04:46,190 --> 02:04:48,410
Momijiro, welcome to Tomato Fire.

1931
02:04:48,530 --> 02:04:49,350
Welcome, welcome.

1932
02:04:51,430 --> 02:04:54,650
Oh my god, it's not even Saturday!

1933
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:05,320
That's what people with fucking jobs do!

1934
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:11,480
Oh my god.

1935
02:05:13,780 --> 02:05:18,640
If anything, there should be more staff working on Saturday!

1936
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:23,560
I refuse to believe this.

1937
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:25,540
I think this is a warehouse in America.

1938
02:05:25,540 --> 02:05:29,200
I fucking refuse to believe this is a warehouse in Japan right now.

1939
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:39,560
It's just this particular machine is in America.

1940
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:43,780
Like, there's only one machine in America and it's this machine.

1941
02:05:44,020 --> 02:05:47,460
I refuse to believe that this is stationed in Japan.

1942
02:05:47,980 --> 02:05:51,000
I fucking refuse to believe it.

1943
02:05:56,280 --> 02:06:01,160
There's a warehouse dedicated to fuck over one person and it's this one.

1944
02:06:02,140 --> 02:06:04,480
Neppers, thank you for the super chat.

1945
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,380
Thank you, thank you.

1946
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:12,560
I don't understand.

1947
02:06:13,740 --> 02:06:15,380
Is there a number we can call?

1948
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:23,840
Is there a number we can... Is there an email that we can email right now?

1949
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:32,980
And Todd, thank you for the super chat.

1950
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:33,780
Thank you, thank you.

1951
02:06:34,460 --> 02:06:36,320
Freedom83 with Torava.

1952
02:06:36,820 --> 02:06:38,220
Thank you for the super chat.

1953
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:39,680
Thank you, thank you.

1954
02:06:42,180 --> 02:06:43,580
Oh my god.

1955
02:06:45,160 --> 02:06:49,620
It's been an hour and it's been an hour.

1956
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:54,860
We've been on this machine for an hour right now.

1957
02:06:54,860 --> 02:06:59,220
We've been on this fucking machine for an hour.

1958
02:07:00,660 --> 02:07:06,220
We have spent collectively $500 for this one plushie.

1959
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:11,300
We're losing to a fucking bear.

1960
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:15,560
We're losing to a fucking bear with abs.

1961
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:19,020
Polly, thank you for the super chat.

1962
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:19,880
Thank you, thank you.

1963
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:24,860
I have a feeling that winning a clean game is a lot harder than winning a Stanley Cup.

1964
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:26,400
Thank you for the super chat.

1965
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:27,500
Thank you, thank you.

1966
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:29,300
We're losing to him!

1967
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:30,660
To him!

1968
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:37,360
Thank you for this excellent anti-gambling PSA.

1969
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:39,760
Nexy, thank you for the super chat.

1970
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:41,320
Thank you, thank you.

1971
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:46,360
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

1972
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:48,660
I can't believe this.

1973
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:54,880
I don't know if there's no one that can...

1974
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:59,760
Is there nobody that can beat this bear?

1975
02:08:01,980 --> 02:08:04,700
I can't believe it.

1976
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:12,700
Is there no one that can beat this fucking bear?

1977
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:16,700
Oh my god.

1978
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:21,140
She's losing hope.

1979
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:24,780
The spark is gone in my eye.

1980
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:34,140
This bear has made more money than I have from this one stream.

1981
02:08:34,140 --> 02:08:34,420
This...

1982
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:42,260
Mero, thank you for the super chat.

1983
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:42,880
Thank you, thank you.

1984
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:44,780
We have gone past the point of no return.

1985
02:08:45,180 --> 02:08:46,880
We can't leave without this bear.

1986
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:49,200
It's a matter of principle.

1987
02:08:49,700 --> 02:08:51,360
Thank you for the super chat.

1988
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:52,500
Thank you, thank you.

1989
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:55,680
This bear is actually richer than me right now.

1990
02:08:55,980 --> 02:09:00,460
Like, he's actually... he's a fucking millionaire at this point, man.

1991
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:04,640
Pick up the sunk cost.

1992
02:09:05,420 --> 02:09:07,240
Yes, there is assist.

1993
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:08,820
I chose this machine.

1994
02:09:09,260 --> 02:09:12,560
Specifically because it said there was assistance.

1995
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:16,100
They said there was assistance.

1996
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:18,400
Where the fuck is it?

1997
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:22,300
None of us has seen it.

1998
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:26,600
Oh my god.

1999
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:29,540
This bear has made more money than all of us.

2000
02:09:29,540 --> 02:09:30,920
In one day.

2001
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:37,880
Bro, at this point, I hope that when I rip open this...

2002
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:39,500
When I like... I won't rip open the bear.

2003
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:44,260
But like, if I like, cut the bear open up just a little bit, there's just cash.

2004
02:09:44,420 --> 02:09:45,860
The entire stuffing is just cash.

2005
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:49,120
Like...

2006
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:51,560
Weave King, thank you for the super chat.

2007
02:09:51,660 --> 02:09:52,360
Thank you, thank you.

2008
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:57,120
I think we have a better chance at winning the lottery than getting this bear.

2009
02:09:57,400 --> 02:09:58,460
Who's gonna win first?

2010
02:09:58,460 --> 02:09:59,800
Someone in my chat.

2011
02:10:00,360 --> 02:10:02,780
Winning the lottery or we win this bear.

2012
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:04,080
At this point.

2013
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:05,280
Thank you for the super chat.

2014
02:10:05,340 --> 02:10:06,200
Thank you, thank you.

2015
02:10:12,260 --> 02:10:14,180
Thank you for the super chat.

2016
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:15,460
Thank you, thank you.

2017
02:10:16,260 --> 02:10:17,700
Thank you for the super chat.

2018
02:10:17,780 --> 02:10:18,700
Thank you, thank you.

2019
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:23,100
The bear is stuffed with Doki's hopes and dreams.

2020
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:33,020
I might as well boot a second game on the right side.

2021
02:10:33,160 --> 02:10:34,920
And then we'll see who wins first.

2022
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:39,520
Me playing this one game or us getting the fucking bear plushie.

2023
02:10:46,060 --> 02:10:47,900
Oh my god.

2024
02:10:50,200 --> 02:10:50,780
Please.

2025
02:10:51,220 --> 02:10:52,600
It's so close.

2026
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:54,560
It's sitting upright again.

2027
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:57,000
How many times do I have to see it sit upright?

2028
02:10:59,420 --> 02:11:01,640
Oh, and then it reset itself.

2029
02:11:06,260 --> 02:11:08,020
Oh my god.

2030
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:10,360
And then it reset itself.

2031
02:11:10,900 --> 02:11:12,600
Damien, thank you for the super chat.

2032
02:11:12,700 --> 02:11:13,840
Thank you, thank you.

2033
02:11:14,260 --> 02:11:17,680
Tom, I bet Min will get their bear plushie first.

2034
02:11:17,940 --> 02:11:18,500
There's nobody.

2035
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:19,440
Nobody will.

2036
02:11:19,900 --> 02:11:20,840
Nobody can.

2037
02:11:21,060 --> 02:11:24,740
This is the worst time that we've ever been in.

2038
02:11:25,140 --> 02:11:26,960
Thank you for the super chat.

2039
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:27,460
Thank you.

2040
02:11:29,020 --> 02:11:30,780
The great reset.

2041
02:11:31,060 --> 02:11:36,000
I swear to god, if this guy gets the fucking plushie when I use the bathroom.

2042
02:11:36,220 --> 02:11:43,000
I spend here watching this one guy trying to get the bear plushie for an hour and 12 minutes.

2043
02:11:43,380 --> 02:11:48,820
And I swear to fucking god, if I go to the bathroom and it's gone, I swear to...

2044
02:11:48,820 --> 02:11:49,900
I'm ending the stream.

2045
02:11:50,020 --> 02:11:50,700
I'll be right back.

2046
02:12:57,510 --> 02:12:58,750
Oh, thank god.

2047
02:12:58,870 --> 02:12:59,970
I'm so happy.

2048
02:13:00,650 --> 02:13:02,250
Oh, thank god.

2049
02:13:02,250 --> 02:13:04,810
I was gonna... I wasn't gonna say it.

2050
02:13:05,030 --> 02:13:10,790
But if I came back and they got the plushie, I was gonna delete the vod.

2051
02:13:16,210 --> 02:13:20,950
If I came back and they got it, I was just gonna delete the vod.

2052
02:13:22,610 --> 02:13:24,630
After everything I've been through.

2053
02:13:24,630 --> 02:13:25,010
I...

2054
02:13:27,970 --> 02:13:34,050
No, I just... I'm not giving anybody the satisfaction after that.

2055
02:13:34,330 --> 02:13:38,110
I... I... I was... I was gonna do it.

2056
02:13:38,350 --> 02:13:43,430
I was gonna fucking end the stream and then you guys are gonna refresh it and then the vod would have been gone.

2057
02:13:49,050 --> 02:13:50,490
Oh, thank god.

2058
02:13:50,490 --> 02:13:51,930
How much do you have to spend?

2059
02:13:52,190 --> 02:13:53,990
Bro, that's what I'm saying.

2060
02:13:54,590 --> 02:13:56,850
How much do we have to spend?

2061
02:13:58,050 --> 02:14:03,050
Do they want us to spend a thousand dollars before they're like, alright, let's help them.

2062
02:14:03,550 --> 02:14:05,010
Thank you for the super chat.

2063
02:14:05,130 --> 02:14:05,930
Thank you, thank you.

2064
02:14:06,230 --> 02:14:11,170
Maybe the real six-packed buff bear are the friends we made along the way.

2065
02:14:11,590 --> 02:14:13,490
Thank you for the super chat.

2066
02:14:13,790 --> 02:14:14,870
Thank you, thank you.

2067
02:14:17,050 --> 02:14:18,390
Oh my god.

2068
02:14:18,530 --> 02:14:19,950
And then you make clips of this.

2069
02:14:20,250 --> 02:14:23,750
I will copyright strike.

2070
02:14:24,470 --> 02:14:25,890
I erase all evidence.

2071
02:14:29,090 --> 02:14:31,410
Nox, thank you for the super chat.

2072
02:14:31,570 --> 02:14:32,490
Thank you, thank you.

2073
02:14:32,790 --> 02:14:35,270
You can do it, don't give up.

2074
02:14:37,310 --> 02:14:39,530
Oh my god.

2075
02:14:40,270 --> 02:14:41,650
It's still here.

2076
02:14:42,370 --> 02:14:44,270
It's still here.

2077
02:14:44,270 --> 02:14:46,050
Now it's 360.

2078
02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:48,730
You guys want to watch it go 360 again?

2079
02:14:50,090 --> 02:14:52,410
Let's rotate it.

2080
02:14:52,510 --> 02:14:55,350
Let's rotate it again.

2081
02:14:56,970 --> 02:14:59,470
Oh my god.

2082
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:01,870
It's okay.

2083
02:15:04,070 --> 02:15:04,970
It's okay.

2084
02:15:05,310 --> 02:15:08,030
Oh my god, it's okay.

2085
02:15:17,010 --> 02:15:18,870
Oh my god.

2086
02:15:19,450 --> 02:15:21,850
Oh my god, finally!

2087
02:15:22,530 --> 02:15:24,190
Holy shit, they're...

2088
02:15:24,190 --> 02:15:26,270
Oh my god, they're real!

2089
02:15:27,070 --> 02:15:28,490
What the fuck?

2090
02:15:28,930 --> 02:15:30,370
It's real.

2091
02:15:30,990 --> 02:15:31,790
It flew.

2092
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:35,270
Guys, it took so long because...

2093
02:15:38,830 --> 02:15:42,930
How were we supposed to get it over there like that?

2094
02:15:42,930 --> 02:15:45,630
How the

2095
02:15:49,490 --> 02:15:50,010
fuck?

2096
02:15:50,190 --> 02:15:52,330
How the fuck?

2097
02:15:52,530 --> 02:15:52,870
Wait.

2098
02:15:53,330 --> 02:15:55,410
I can't fucking fit on it.

2099
02:15:55,450 --> 02:15:58,750
I was supposed to be like, everybody leave and then I'll get it.

2100
02:16:03,530 --> 02:16:04,890
Oh my god.

2101
02:16:05,690 --> 02:16:08,490
Oh my god, we fucking did it!

2102
02:16:13,930 --> 02:16:15,510
Oh my god.

2103
02:16:15,510 --> 02:16:20,590
Oh no fucking way, we fucking did it.

2104
02:16:22,250 --> 02:16:25,850
Oh my god, oh my god, it was real.

2105
02:16:26,410 --> 02:16:27,930
Oh my god.

2106
02:16:28,270 --> 02:16:30,310
Oh my god, this is my video.

2107
02:16:31,330 --> 02:16:35,050
Oh my god, we're finally free.

2108
02:16:35,650 --> 02:16:38,330
We're finally fucking free.

2109
02:16:39,250 --> 02:16:42,170
Bro, oh my god.

2110
02:16:43,290 --> 02:16:55,930
Sorry, the Sumimasen took fucking forever because they had to fly a man in Japan to America to reset this one machine that's fucking located in Ohio's warehouse.

2111
02:16:56,310 --> 02:17:00,950
That guy and I were actually free.

2112
02:17:01,490 --> 02:17:03,390
Oh my god.

2113
02:17:03,830 --> 02:17:06,530
It's actually fucking crazy.

2114
02:17:06,530 --> 02:17:13,130
It took us collectively, I think we spent $600 for this one machine.

2115
02:17:13,270 --> 02:17:20,270
Hey guys, if you're wondering what did we make off of this, don't worry.

2116
02:17:21,150 --> 02:17:23,210
Don't worry guys, I got you.

2117
02:17:23,550 --> 02:17:31,230
So, let me tell you guys exactly what prizes we won today in two and a half hours.

2118
02:17:31,410 --> 02:17:32,430
Don't worry guys.

2119
02:17:33,370 --> 02:17:36,650
Watch that guy not even be a dragon.

2120
02:17:36,870 --> 02:17:39,030
Don't say that.

2121
02:17:39,630 --> 02:17:43,330
Please, if you won the plot, please reveal yourself.

2122
02:17:43,450 --> 02:17:47,870
You have to be a dragon, there's no fucking way.

2123
02:17:48,230 --> 02:17:50,770
Please, have we not suffered enough?

2124
02:17:51,090 --> 02:17:56,330
I swear to god, if it wasn't Dragoon that won this, I swear to fucking god.

2125
02:17:56,930 --> 02:17:59,190
After everything we've been through.

2126
02:18:00,490 --> 02:18:06,090
After watching that thing rotate 20 fucking times, I swear to god.

2127
02:18:06,570 --> 02:18:08,670
Mero, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2128
02:18:08,750 --> 02:18:11,730
Doki's smile is worth every penny.

2129
02:18:12,110 --> 02:18:15,250
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2130
02:18:15,570 --> 02:18:17,490
Alright, so for those who are wondering.

2131
02:18:17,630 --> 02:18:19,010
Oh my god, Doki.

2132
02:18:19,230 --> 02:18:26,630
So like, exactly what did you win during that entire playthrough?

2133
02:18:26,630 --> 02:18:29,790
Well, thank you for asking me that.

2134
02:18:30,170 --> 02:18:31,490
So, um, alright.

2135
02:18:31,890 --> 02:18:33,970
So, um, in Toraba.

2136
02:18:34,510 --> 02:18:35,590
In Toraba.

2137
02:18:36,290 --> 02:18:36,930
Um.

2138
02:18:38,330 --> 02:18:42,830
We have collectively spent, um.

2139
02:18:43,150 --> 02:18:45,930
Let's see, let me calculate this for all of us.

2140
02:18:46,070 --> 02:18:50,690
We have collectively spent at least, um.

2141
02:18:51,490 --> 02:18:54,510
700 to 800 dollars.

2142
02:18:55,310 --> 02:18:59,330
So, that's what we spent as a team, by the way.

2143
02:18:59,850 --> 02:19:00,730
As a team.

2144
02:19:00,890 --> 02:19:04,230
So like, not just me, but me and my dragoons together.

2145
02:19:04,730 --> 02:19:08,230
And then like, as a team, we won.

2146
02:19:09,190 --> 02:19:12,250
The sick ass robot cat butler.

2147
02:19:13,350 --> 02:19:13,730
And...

2148
02:19:16,110 --> 02:19:23,350
And, as a team, we also won.

2149
02:19:24,670 --> 02:19:28,570
We also won a bear plushie.

2150
02:19:28,610 --> 02:19:29,110
So.

2151
02:19:30,410 --> 02:19:32,910
And, yep, guys, we did it.

2152
02:19:38,510 --> 02:19:40,550
Look at that dragoons.

2153
02:19:41,270 --> 02:19:41,810
Oh my god.

2154
02:19:43,210 --> 02:19:47,630
Oh my god.

2155
02:19:48,250 --> 02:19:51,190
Thor, you did it, you madman!

2156
02:19:51,190 --> 02:19:53,730
You fucking did it!

2157
02:19:54,050 --> 02:19:55,490
You madman!

2158
02:19:56,130 --> 02:19:57,450
I want it for you.

2159
02:19:57,750 --> 02:20:01,830
Once I get it, I'll buy your pillbox and then I'll send it to you for Doki.

2160
02:20:02,250 --> 02:20:05,230
And when I say, I promise you I'll take nothing.

2161
02:20:05,650 --> 02:20:08,230
You did it, you trinket heart pity!

2162
02:20:08,830 --> 02:20:10,730
You fucking did it!

2163
02:20:11,710 --> 02:20:14,790
I'm so proud of all of us.

2164
02:20:15,250 --> 02:20:18,010
I'm so proud of all of us.

2165
02:20:18,010 --> 02:20:22,810
We spent 700 to 800 to get there.

2166
02:20:23,960 --> 02:20:26,090
Got two items.

2167
02:20:27,210 --> 02:20:31,450
I'm never coming back to Dora.

2168
02:20:33,650 --> 02:20:37,830
That was my last journey.

2169
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:43,190
Guys, I can't believe...

2170
02:20:43,190 --> 02:20:45,750
I didn't even get a heart pity!

2171
02:20:45,750 --> 02:20:49,490
I actually had to do this myself.

2172
02:20:50,050 --> 02:20:51,770
Like, he fucking...

2173
02:20:51,770 --> 02:20:55,830
He loaded up 100k of TP points.

2174
02:20:56,730 --> 02:20:57,570
100k!

2175
02:20:57,950 --> 02:20:58,610
No, 900!

2176
02:20:58,930 --> 02:21:02,050
He bought 150k of TP points.

2177
02:21:03,330 --> 02:21:07,490
And it took that much to trigger heart pity.

2178
02:21:13,690 --> 02:21:19,190
I don't get to know your crash yet right now, but I'd like to humbly request a happy birthday.

2179
02:21:20,130 --> 02:21:21,990
Just going through things.

2180
02:21:22,490 --> 02:21:24,310
But like, but like...

2181
02:21:26,730 --> 02:21:30,030
Don't worry, Usni, you only get one birthday.

2182
02:21:30,290 --> 02:21:32,070
I get a million crashouts.

2183
02:21:32,210 --> 02:21:33,990
Thank you for the superchat, Usni.

2184
02:21:33,990 --> 02:21:35,370
Thank you, thank you.

2185
02:21:35,670 --> 02:21:37,470
Happy birthday to you!

2186
02:21:37,470 --> 02:21:39,930
Happy birthday to you!

2187
02:21:40,390 --> 02:21:42,430
Happy birthday, dear Usni!

2188
02:21:42,650 --> 02:21:44,850
Happy birthday to you!

2189
02:21:45,130 --> 02:21:45,590
Yeah!

2190
02:21:46,370 --> 02:21:47,570
Happy birthday!

2191
02:21:48,610 --> 02:21:51,830
I'm so happy that, like, we did it, guys.

2192
02:21:52,010 --> 02:21:52,850
As a team.

2193
02:21:53,330 --> 02:21:54,230
We did it.

2194
02:21:54,230 --> 02:21:59,170
I'm gonna have a robot cat butler fucking driving in and giving me my Uber Eats.

2195
02:22:00,130 --> 02:22:02,110
Yes, I need to cool down.

2196
02:22:02,310 --> 02:22:03,550
I'm gonna call and hear everybody.

2197
02:22:03,810 --> 02:22:06,150
But like, I'll show something before we go.

2198
02:22:06,670 --> 02:22:11,530
If you guys didn't know, we do have pre-orders up for the concert merch.

2199
02:22:11,650 --> 02:22:15,130
Like, even if you didn't go to a concert, you can still get the merch.

2200
02:22:15,170 --> 02:22:16,230
You can still buy the merch.

2201
02:22:16,490 --> 02:22:20,470
And pre-orders, I believe, end next week.

2202
02:22:20,670 --> 02:22:24,150
So yeah, make sure you grab them before it's gone forever, guys.

2203
02:22:25,270 --> 02:22:25,590
Yeah.

2204
02:22:26,450 --> 02:22:28,690
My mod posted the link in the chat.

2205
02:22:29,050 --> 02:22:32,750
Grab the Oshie Sparks concert merch before it's gone.

2206
02:22:32,810 --> 02:22:34,070
It's the Phantom Thief concert.

2207
02:22:34,070 --> 02:22:36,070
Anyway, I'm gonna fucking...

2208
02:22:37,370 --> 02:22:39,830
I guess just exist for now.

2209
02:22:41,870 --> 02:22:43,050
It's so weird.

2210
02:22:44,550 --> 02:22:47,170
I need to fucking recuperate today.

2211
02:22:47,670 --> 02:22:49,450
Hey guys, as always, everybody.

2212
02:22:49,890 --> 02:22:50,610
Stay hydrated.

2213
02:22:50,970 --> 02:22:51,610
Posture check.

2214
02:22:51,850 --> 02:22:54,730
Yes, my cat butler is smaller than my fucking bear.

2215
02:22:57,270 --> 02:22:57,870
Oh,

2216
02:23:01,690 --> 02:23:02,350
it took 50...

2217
02:23:02,590 --> 02:23:03,330
Oh, thank god.

2218
02:23:03,330 --> 02:23:04,650
I was a little worried.

2219
02:23:04,910 --> 02:23:06,270
Okay, then it's $600.

2220
02:23:06,730 --> 02:23:07,290
Thank god.

2221
02:23:07,370 --> 02:23:08,070
I was a little worried.

2222
02:23:08,170 --> 02:23:08,330
Alright.

2223
02:23:08,610 --> 02:23:10,350
It was $600 in the end.

2224
02:23:10,730 --> 02:23:11,030
Liz!

2225
02:23:11,270 --> 02:23:13,470
Thank you for the superchat.

2226
02:23:13,550 --> 02:23:14,110
Thank you, thank you.

2227
02:23:14,230 --> 02:23:15,870
May your smile be a gift to our lives.

2228
02:23:16,170 --> 02:23:17,830
And may you always be a funny and chaotic bird.

2229
02:23:18,050 --> 02:23:19,170
You're always my Oshie.

2230
02:23:19,270 --> 02:23:19,750
Once more.

2231
02:23:19,990 --> 02:23:20,370
Huzzah!

2232
02:23:20,510 --> 02:23:21,710
Thank you for the superchat, Thorne.

2233
02:23:21,770 --> 02:23:22,610
Thank you, thank you.

2234
02:23:22,910 --> 02:23:24,070
Zero, thank you for the superchat.

2235
02:23:24,170 --> 02:23:24,830
Thank you, thank you.

2236
02:23:25,130 --> 02:23:27,910
We're thinking of setting up a merch gacha on our booth next con.

2237
02:23:28,210 --> 02:23:31,330
Thanks for proving it's the right move.

2238
02:23:31,330 --> 02:23:33,350
Thank you for the superchat.

2239
02:23:33,410 --> 02:23:34,030
Thank you, thank you.

2240
02:23:34,210 --> 02:23:35,430
You know what I'm happy about?

2241
02:23:35,730 --> 02:23:38,070
I'm glad it wasn't Smurf Papa.

2242
02:23:38,310 --> 02:23:40,830
I'm so fucking happy it wasn't.

2243
02:23:41,550 --> 02:23:44,650
Cause that was serial killer vibes right there.

2244
02:23:44,910 --> 02:23:46,170
That was so fun.

2245
02:23:48,470 --> 02:23:49,270
Hey, guys.

2246
02:23:49,750 --> 02:23:50,570
As always, everybody.

2247
02:23:50,990 --> 02:23:51,630
Stay hydrated.

2248
02:23:52,050 --> 02:23:52,570
Pause the chat.

2249
02:23:52,690 --> 02:23:54,510
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2250
02:23:54,710 --> 02:23:56,830
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

2251
02:23:56,910 --> 02:23:58,310
Cause you deserve it.

2252
02:23:58,470 --> 02:24:00,090
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2253
02:24:00,090 --> 02:24:01,310
Bye, guys.

2254
02:24:01,550 --> 02:24:02,110
Bye.
