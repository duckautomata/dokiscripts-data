So, we're going to start.

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,080
We're going to start it now.

27
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,720
We're going to start it now.

28
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,480

Thank you all for coming to my Twitch stream.

37
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,120
That's my professional streamer.

38
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,080
Can't swear today.

39
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:55,600
Can't swear.

40
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,860

00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,260

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,340
Wait, where's the?

47
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:08,960

Let's watch this.

49
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,060
Are you all ready?

50
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,320
All right, we're ready.

51
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,340
In my upcoming film, Shelter.

52
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:14,640
I'm going to go.

53
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:21,040
never watched this one i play michael mason a man hiding
from his past oh my god that's jason stadham must come out

54
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:28,020
of the shadows wait that is worth standing ground for to
have a chance i could be jason stadham and fortnite now it's

55
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:37,980
your turn to take on the threats to check what is important
gain the experience of jason my goat and ultimately yes that

56
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:46,120
guy from fast and furious the storm is coming wait you saw
this movie what do you rate it you can Jason Statham in

57
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,560
Fortnite.

58
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,480
All right, so this is a film starring Jason Statham.

59
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,260
It's only in theaters January 3rd.

60
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,940
Wait, it's in theaters now!

61
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,820
Guys, you can actually check out the movie right now.

62
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,660
It is an action-packed film starring Jason Statham, one of
Jason Statham's most layered performances yet.

63
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,560
Her safety, his mission, unshackled.

64
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,640
This is the calm before the storm.

65
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,480
It's not just a creative map, it's a full roguelike.

66
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:24,320
That means every time we die, we keep our gold, hit the
upgrade hub, and come back stronger than ever.

67
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,460
It's got that just one more run energy, and I know you guys
love it.

68
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,120
If you're a fan of Jason Saddam, you have to see it.

69
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,000
This map is tied to his new movie, Shelter.

70
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,360
We're basically playing alongside him as an Elite M16
assassin.

71
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,100
We even get to team up with this character, Michael Mason,
for the final boss fight.

72
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,800
Look at this skill tree.

73
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:58,960
We can unlock weapon upgrades, better supplies, and even get
help from Jack the Dog for mid-run, oh my, mid-run buffs.

74
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,780
Oh my god, they got a dog in this movie.

75
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,660
Help me decide what to spec into first.

76
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,940
Do we go full glass cannon or build for survival so we can
actually reach the lighthouse?

77
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,980
atmosphere in this UEFN map is insane.

78
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,360
They recreated that moody Scottish island vibe from the
movie perfectly.

79
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:28,360
It feels less like a minigame and more like a standalone
action game in sight inside Fortnite.

80
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,880
This is, by the way, just to be clear, this is also in
support of the movie.

81
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,900
And Shelter is in theaters right now.

82
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:48,180
Yeah, and Fortnite, they brought the basically they brought
the films the film stuff to life so in fortnite so you can

83
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:56,520
play as jason jason statum um and this is a new side of
jason that we haven't seen before remember it's in theaters

84
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:09,280
on january 30th right now yay oh my god it's jason statum
and then that's your name

85
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,380

86

I made it.

92
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,640
I mean, it's not Fortnite right now.

93
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,620
I mean, I feel like I could, I feel like I should, let's try
it out.

They're like, that's how they get you.

158
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,920
Like those loot boxes slash mystery boxes, that's how they
get you.

159
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,300
You subscribe it once.

160
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,640
It's like a gym membership.

161
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,520
You just never cancel it.

162
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,240
You're in too deep.

163
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,960

00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,780
Oh, my God.

00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,230
I can't shoot it.

524
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,190
There's a barrier.

525
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,550
I refuse to help.

526
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,170
He's gotta learn.

527
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,150
He's gotta learn.

528
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,350
Wait, he's dead.

529
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,150
Time to restart, Alan.

530
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,170
Wait.

531
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:55,450
Create him.

532
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,370
Oh, shit, nice.

533
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,270
Yay, free item.

534
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,310
Twin hammer shot.

535
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,850
Wait, that's like OP as hell.

536
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:17,570
Goink.

537
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,370
Mine now.

538
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,450
Yay.

539
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,310
Where is he?

540
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,510
Oh, he has to start from one.

541
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,970
Guys, I think we might have to move.

542
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:31,910
Oh, hey, nice.

543
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,770
Guys, I think we might have to replace Alan.

544
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:39,130
He's a little bit of a dead weight right now.

545
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,190
Surprisingly, I thought it'd be Mordecai.

546
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,760
Wait, he's almost there.

547
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,780
He's making it.

548
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,220
Wait, Alan.

549
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh.

550
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,700
this area.

551
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,520
Oh, I have.

552
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,260
It's okay, Morphus.

553
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,680
It's okay.

554
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,740
You're not last.

555
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,120
We have a new target.

556
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,960
All right, but also, Mordecai, you did die in the first
room, though.

557
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,980
You did die in the first room.

558
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,900
Yeah, they give it 100 videos.

559
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,780
Thank you, thank you.

560
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,080
This is the plot of the movie.

561
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,720
Oh, he's making it.

562
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,900
He's making it.

563
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,500
Come on, Alan.

564
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,160
You're almost there.

565
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,360
Don't worry, I'll show you.

566
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,500
This is more accurate.

567
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,620
Drop it like it's hot.

568
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,060
Alan,

569
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,400
you're almost there, Alan!

570
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,460
We're helping!

571
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,620
We're helping, Alan!

572
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,880
We're giving you a show!

573
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,280
All right, let's go.

574
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,200
All right, let's go.

575
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:40,960
Let's move on.

576
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,800
Next room.

577
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,440
We got this.

578
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,320
Come on, let's go.

579
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,080
All right, now that we're all here, room clear.

580
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,860
All right, let's go to the next room.

581
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,520
Yeah, I'm loon-alting.

582
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,080
I'm loon-alting right now.

583
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,040
Oh, enemies appearing.

584
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,200
Oh, oh.

585
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,920
Are they all in that tunnel?

586
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,780
Oh, my God.

587
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,640
Okay, that's okay.

588
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,060
I'm suppressing fire.

589
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:12,860
There you go.

590
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:16,880
Oh my god.

591
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Wait, can I shoot through here?

592
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,680
I can't.

593
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,040
Oh my god.

594
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,680
We actually can't shoot from this.

595
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,710
Okay, who shot me?

596
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,810
Okay, who was it?

597
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,050
Who was it?

598
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,810

00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:35,890

600
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,590

Okay, these guys are, like, jacked up.

611
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,960
Like, they have more HP than 10 people.

612
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,500
One more.

613
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,480

614
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,580
Wait, where's the last guy?

615
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,380
He's hiding.

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,000
Where did he go?

617
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,040
Oh, there he is.

618
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,060
The AI stopped working.

619
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,180
All right, we gotta get the shield potion.

620
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,920
Like, I'm messed up right now.

621

Wait.

All right, are we all ready?

633
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,440

00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,560
What is this?

635
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,340
Oh, wait, is that beam?

636
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,120
Wait, how much damage can I do for this?

637
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,300
Do I have to charge it all the way up?

638
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,260
Okay, that's a little mess.

639
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:40,800
All right, let's go.

640
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,980
That's a little messed up.

641
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,200
Oh, no, not another corridor.

00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,770
Oh, there's like a charge up.

646
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:58,970

912
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,190
He can't see me.

913
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,180

Oh, my God.

970
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,820
These guys are actual meat shields.

971
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:44,840
I swear to God.

972
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,780
They're like bullet sponges.

973
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:55,850
Like, what is... What kind of bulletproof vest are they
wearing?

974
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:58,290
Okay.

Alright, it's okay.

979
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,180
You're not expecting this.

980
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,880
You're not expecting the most obvious plank ever.

981
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:18,380
That's alright.

982
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,000
I'm flanking.

983
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,580
I'm flanking in front of them.

984
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,120
Nice.

985
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:24,960
Last guy.

01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:25,480
Last guy.

987
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:26,520
Nice.

988
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:27,500
We did it.

989
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,300
Alright, what do we get?

990
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:29,820
Bandages?

991
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,200
Oh, man, I actually really need this.

992
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,360
I'm really messed up right now.

993
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:35,780
Oh, my God.

994
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,200
I forgot about my upgrades again.

995
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:38,440
Okay.

996
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,160
I got shields out of it.

997
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,320
Alright.

998
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,200
Hoop.

999
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,080
My five shields.

1000
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,220
My five shields and a dream.

1001
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,800
Ooh, snarf juice.

1002
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:55,640
Actually, it doesn't really matter when you have, like,
five...

1003
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,440
Alright, this is where things get tough, guys.

1004
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,600
Remember, the boss here is a gamer.

1005
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:03,560
Oh,

1006
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:09,140
God.

1007
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:09,840
Oh, God.

1008
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:12,720
Don't let go!

1009
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,860
Okay, he doesn't see me.

1010
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:23,900
Okay, I got the rock.

1011
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,180
Wait, I got my slurp juice.

1012
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:31,420
I'm slurping.

1013
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,060
I'm slurping.

1014
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:36,290
Boom.

1015
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:37,990
Well, that did nothing.

1016
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,230
Like, with the charge up.

1017
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:43,960
Okay, there you go.

1018
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:44,660
Oh, shit.

1019
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:45,540
Oh, shit.

1020
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,520
Who's looking at me?

1021
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:52,410
All right.

1022
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:52,930
What?

1023
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,050
Guys, I'm so safe.

1024
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:57,670
I'm really safe right now.

1025
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:00,390
Guys, guys, I am very safe.

1026
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:01,270
Wait, we're missing one.

1027
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:02,570
Where did our last guy go?

1028
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:05,810
Guys, I'm very safe.

1029
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:07,010
Oh, no.

1030
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:08,830
We lost Hatsune Miku.

1031
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:12,850
Oh, no.

1032
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:14,150
Oh, no.

1033
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:15,610
Not Hatsune Miku.

1034
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:18,590
Wait, I have an idea.

1035
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:22,810
Okay, watch this.

1036
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,300
This AI doesn't know.

1037
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:31,820
Oh my gosh, the AI is so confused.

1038
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:36,350
There we go.

1039
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:37,090
We did it.

1040
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,430
Oh my, Hatune Miku down.

1041
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:44,390

1042
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,390
Oh, I was gonna say, what?

1043
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:47,570
Doggo?

1044
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:49,210

01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:31,140
Well, at least me and Mordecai made it.

1048
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:37,820
We made it, though, Mordecai.

1049
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,500
We did it.

1050
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,840
Okay, I gotta grab some H.

1051
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,040
I gotta grab some shields.

1052
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,600
That 5 was not it.

1053
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,700
Let me get it.

1054
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,160
Alright, more damage.

All damage.

1056
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:00,250
We did it.

1057
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:05,150
I think, Mordecai, it's just you and me, Mordecai.

1058
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:07,150
We gotta go.

1059
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:08,650
We gotta go live on.

1060
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:12,310
We gotta progress in their memory, Mordecai.

1061
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:14,170
Remember SMGs.

1062
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:17,610
We will remember them.

1063
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:18,870
Let's go.

1064
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:19,890
You and I.

1065
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:21,290
We can do this.

1066
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:23,150
Surely it doesn't scale.

1067
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:31,290
Okay.

1068
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:35,550

You're still worthy victim.

1214
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:45,620
Oh, my God.

1215
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:47,260

I challenge you.

1225
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,380
Surely one of you guys would want to challenge me.

1226
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:16,220
The Luna line.

1227
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,660
The Luna Konga line.

1228
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:21,560
Surely anyone in the Luna Konga line.

1229
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,620
Too busy being Luna.

1230
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:26,460
I'm a Tainan mutant.

1231
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:32,760
Man, this is like the meeting of the Plats.

1232
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:33,900
That's everyone.

1233
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:42,020
All right, I'm going to take my risk on a private profile
I'm taking my risk.

1234
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:42,960
Oh, my God.

1235
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:43,940
No, don't accept it.

1236
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:49,940
Don't Wait, I found him.

1237
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:55,240

1238
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:58,040

1239
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:02,380
Okay, plat three.

1240
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,280
Okay, this is doable.

1241
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,560
This is doable.

1242
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,660
Now you don't want them to accept.

1243
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,300
Let him read his book.

1244
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,140
I didn't think.

1245
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,500
I was getting rejected all night.

1246
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,820
How was I supposed to know he was finally going to accept
it?

1247
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:27,660
Oh my god.

1248
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:28,540
This is actually bad.

1249
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,500
This is a bad matchup for me.

1250
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:38,930
Because I don't get healed.

1251
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:40,530
This is illegal.

1252
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:46,270
Wait, wait, he's just healing!

1253
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:49,170
Wait, it's not fair!

1254
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:52,540
Wait!

1255
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:55,840
Wait a minute!

1256
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:02,960
What the fuck was- Oh my god.

1257
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,140
Oh my god, he just kept- he just kept healing!

1258
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:23,170
all right guys it's okay i got third place oh my god i'm
just gonna get healed diff i should have just played support

1259
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:26,970
i should have just played support

1260
01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:41,210
there we go that's right cat out healed that cat out healed
this i'll heal this You know what?

1261
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:44,530
Let's do it.

1262
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:48,510
Let's do this.

1263
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:50,050
When did we get out of Myvo?

1264
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:51,250
This is my second job.

1265
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:54,330
What?

1266
01:19:57,810 --> 01:20:00,170
Alright, I didn't expect Emma.

1267
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:03,910
Oh, no.

1268
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:07,250
This is actually very bad as Loki to play against Emma.

1269
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:14,890
He...

1270
01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:18,610
Which one?

1271
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:21,130
Which one?

1272
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:34,160
Which one is it?

1273
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,460
Which lucky person?

1274
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:43,420
Cross through the TP bit.

1275
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:47,760
Just don't move that.

1276
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:50,760
Yeah.

1277
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,300
Lucky bird is.

1278
01:20:53,320 --> 01:21:10,900
real still a plat player after he's just like which one is
it all right let's queue up for an actual game now all right

1279
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:21,360
here we go let's put our game face on we put our game face
on we're locked in

1280
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:39,990
I'm so it's mine couldn't process what just happened it's
okay me too honestly Emma's actually really good against

1281
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:49,550
Loki only for the fact that like she can build off her
charge off of my clones that's why I was like oh no I was

1282
01:21:49,550 --> 01:21:54,630
freaking out I was like oh no what is she gonna do

1283
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:02,060
Oh, while we wait, you know what that means?

1284
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,360
Since we're waiting.

1285
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,420
Wait, maybe I should try that strat more.

1286
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:13,500
I'm going to try that strat more.

1287
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:15,380
That's actually pretty smart.

1288
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:31,570
Apparently, apparently, there's already drama tweets about
the Terra versus Kingsman.

1289
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:50,850
I think that's crazy like no he closed doors he knew he knew
yeah I saw a tweet that had like a 1k likes just now he knew

1290
01:22:50,850 --> 01:23:02,170
he took it away from me wouldn't see boy I want to see if we
actually I want to see if it works.

1291
01:23:03,130 --> 01:23:04,090
That was pretty funny.

1292
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:05,370
Not gonna lie.

1293
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:06,430
No!

1294
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,180
Wait, Melina.

1295
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:14,700
Melina.

1296
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:15,100
Wait.

1297
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:16,860
Melina.

1298
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:17,960
Okay, I thought it was this Melania.

1299
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,040
I was like, wait, aren't you supposed to...

1300
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:24,500
I was gonna say, aren't you supposed to be in that
tournament?

1301
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,700
Or was did he got knockout?

1302
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:27,340
I don't remember.

1303
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:30,420
Don't worry.

1304
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,620
Triple support is the way to go.

1305
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,440
Because we have no tank players.

1306
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:38,140
Who am I gonna from this match.

1307
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:40,900
Don't worry.

1308
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:44,160
Oops, all support players.

1309
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:46,540
Love to see it.

1310
01:24:02,810 --> 01:24:03,030
Yay.

1311
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:05,270
Oops, triple support.

1312
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:10,870
Good.

1313
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:12,230
I'm ready.

1314
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:22,670
Yeah.

1315
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:26,010
You know what?

1316
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:28,010
I'm going to reward myself with...

1317
01:24:28,010 --> 01:24:29,030
Oh, a cough drop.

1318
01:24:36,050 --> 01:24:38,170
It's never too late to have triple.

1319
01:24:38,330 --> 01:24:38,750
Don't worry.

1320
01:24:38,930 --> 01:24:41,970
It's never too late for triple DPS to come in.

1321
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:44,550
We just gotta wait for number three.

1322
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:46,570
Number three.

1323
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:47,870
What do you want?

1324
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:48,850
Five.

1325
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:51,030
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the...

1326
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:52,870
I want a tank for five.

1327
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,720
How many hatches in?

1328
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:01,660
Yeah.

1329
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:03,920
Yeah.

1330
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:11,600
What?

1331
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:16,180
This is in rake now?

1332
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,300
Oh no.

1333
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:22,360
Wait, do you want to play mag?

1334
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,360
Oh no.

1335
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:28,740
Oh no, where am I?

1336
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:31,280
Where am I?

1337
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:34,800
It's the new map.

1338
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,660
What do you mean a new map is in rake now?

1339
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:38,640
What?

1340
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,500
Where do I go?

1341
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:45,700
Where is the- oh, it's over here.

1342
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:47,600
Why is it so orange?

1343
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,680
Where do they show up?

1344
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:58,060
Like, where do I position myself?

1345
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:04,310
I am just confused.

1346
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:08,770
Oh my god, you're fine.

1347
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:09,370
You're so healthy.

1348
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:14,730
What's hitting me?

1349
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:15,630
I knew it.

1350
01:26:16,530 --> 01:26:19,730
What the fuck is hitting me right now?

1351
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:24,510

Wait, they're running triple.

1354
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:35,360
Wait, why do they get to run triple?

1355
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:38,700
That's not fair.

1356
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:39,680

1381
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:03,770
Why did we ban, why did we not ban Gambit?

1382
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:14,590
Oh my god, oh wait, we...

1383
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:16,010
Awesome, why does Gold...

01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:17,950
Where is this map heading?

1385
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:26,560
That's another...

1386
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,040
Man, if only we ban Gambit.

1387
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:46,060

1389
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:02,400

1390
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:08,500
But as of right now, this map fucking sucks.

1391
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:18,770
Like, I don't know where to fucking position myself right
now.

1392
01:31:19,630 --> 01:31:21,170
Oh, my God.

1393
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:23,370
Okay.

01:31:27,070 --> 01:31:28,110
There we go.

1395
01:31:29,170 --> 01:31:30,110
He lives that.

1396
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:31,850
I don't even know where he dashed.

1397
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:33,150
Wait up.

1398
01:31:35,310 --> 01:31:36,350
Wait up.

1399
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:37,270
Fuck, did he?

1400
01:31:37,290 --> 01:31:39,110
He is mad at that.

1401
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:50,920
Let's keep fighting.

1402
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:51,740
Let's keep fighting!

1403
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,760
We can still fight here!

1404
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:55,780
Come on guys!

1405
01:31:58,030 --> 01:31:58,530
First!

1406
01:31:59,030 --> 01:31:59,950
It's over now.

1407
01:32:00,830 --> 01:32:01,810
It's over now.

1408
01:32:03,410 --> 01:32:04,790
It's actually over now.

1409
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:13,740
Never mind.

1410
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:15,060
The fight has ended.

1411
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:21,800
Surprisingly, the fight has ended.

1412
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:28,260
Can't pull me when I have a dope.

1413
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,420
Well, he didn't pull me though.

1414
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:32,880
Just remember that.

1415
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:35,920
He didn't really pull me.

1416
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:38,460
We are undefeatable.

1417
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,200
Alright, we got a pocket.

1418
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:40,820
This guy.

1419
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:43,040
Make sure he's okay.

1420
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:46,360
They just don't take damage.

1421
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:47,100
This is crazy.

1422
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,760
Oh my god, it's too late.

1423
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:50,600

Yeah, and then we're going same combo with that in our body.

1425
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:02,080
To be fair, they...

1426
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,020
They have the thing.

1427
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:04,360
We don't.

1428
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:05,740
That hit me.

1429
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:11,090

Okay, that's my fault.

1440
01:34:13,890 --> 01:34:16,410
Bougar Bash one without us.

1441
01:34:18,470 --> 01:34:19,970
You played too deep.

1442
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:21,650
You played here like in front of the...

01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:22,750
And shut up, Rita.

1444
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:24,690
I was not in this spot.

1445
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:27,330
I got pulled in by the Spider-Man, but okay.

1446
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:28,570
Oh, okay.

1447
01:34:29,870 --> 01:34:31,010
Oh, shit, Rita.

01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:34,370
No, I don't play Gambit.

1449
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:36,170
Our Gambit players take an M on.

1450
01:34:36,970 --> 01:34:37,810
I'll play Gambit.

1451
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:38,870
I'll play Gambit.

1452
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:43,530
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of that.

1453
01:34:43,630 --> 01:34:44,250
Back to your M on.

1454
01:34:45,010 --> 01:34:46,230
The battle starts in five.

1455
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:47,890
Don't talk to me, I'm dead.

1456
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:55,990
Oh, dude, he's so...

in.

1459
01:35:08,190 --> 01:35:09,250

01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:52,480

us please let us take the kids to school I think

1483
01:38:05,050 --> 01:38:08,150
like half of this team was OCE

1484
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:34,400
I'm pretty sure Oh my god what's OCE Oceanic Australia slash
New Zealand Yeah I think I think these I think, yeah.

1485
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:37,800
Why did I play it?

1486
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:39,420
And they, because OCE is dead!

1487
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:41,880
They're never gonna get a game.

1488
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:46,440
They're never gonna get a game in OCE servers.

1489
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,040
That's so hot.

1490
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:54,000
As I heard an accent on all three players that were yelling
at each other.

1491
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:59,380
All three players that were yelling each other had accents.

1492
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:02,300
And I was like, well, they all know each other.

1493
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:03,060
I wonder why.

1494
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:13,180
I was just like, well, all three of them seem to know each
other, and they all seem to really hate each other.

1495
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:22,600
They have to QNA so they can get gains.

1496
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:26,520
I'm gonna Q dodge real quick.

1497
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,040
I'm gonna Q dodge.

1498
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:30,600
I don't think I want to be in that game.

1499
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:32,300
I don't think I want to be in that system.

1500
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:38,230
Let's check.

1501
01:39:39,690 --> 01:39:40,750
Have they won?

1502
01:39:40,970 --> 01:39:41,670
Wait, who won?

1503
01:39:42,290 --> 01:39:43,030
Did they win yet?

1504
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:46,210
Who won?

1505
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,280
I'm just gonna wait.

1506
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:53,020
I don't want to be in this system.

1507
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:55,560
J3's team won?

1508
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:56,660
You know what?

1509
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:58,280
We lost to the champions.

1510
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,760
That means, guys, we lost.

1511
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:06,800
We lost to the team that won.

1512
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:11,200
So technically, you might say that that's second place.

1513
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:15,780
Basically, that might as well...

1514
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:19,120
Yeah, that's basically second place if you think about it.

1515
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:27,520
Exactly.

1516
01:40:28,340 --> 01:40:28,980
Technically second.

1517
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:32,320
We lost the champion team.

1518
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:35,780
It's because they banned Spider-Man.

1519
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:38,940
Oh, did they ban Spider-Man first instead of Gambit first?

1520
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,560
what it is.

1521
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:46,360
Because I'm like, how did they get out of it?

1522
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:48,340
So they let Gambit in?

1523
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,260
Yeah, but was Gambit bad?

1524
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:21,360
Gambit was played with Loki.

1525
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:24,180
Oh, that's interesting.

1526
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:27,280
Technically second.

1527
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:28,560
I will...

1528
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:29,500
I take this.

1529
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:32,700
We lost to the champion, so technically second.

1530
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:35,440
No, I'm Q dodging the full roster.

1531
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,640
I'm Q dodging the full.

1532
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:44,080
Question.

1533
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:47,940
How to remove the collab ads on mobile Twitch?

1534
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:51,840
20 more minutes.

1535
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:57,320
Wrong.

1536
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:58,380
Don't worry.

1537
01:41:59,160 --> 01:41:59,580
Time.

1538
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:01,760
That's how.

1539
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:03,180
Good question.

1540
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:05,460
God.

1541
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:08,420
Just 20 more minutes.

1542
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:16,940
Alright, I'll just, I'll do one more duel.

1543
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:17,940
And it made me.

1544
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:21,120
I want to try out the duel.

1545
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,240
I want to try out the low-key strat.

1546
01:42:26,610 --> 01:42:28,490
See if it works again.

1547
01:42:30,410 --> 01:42:31,690
What's, where are you?

1548
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:35,110
Where is he?

1549
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:37,950
It was literally the first guy I saw in the name.

1550
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:40,610
Oh my god, he disappeared.

1551
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:42,730
You saw me hover it.

1552
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:46,470
That's real.

1553
01:42:46,690 --> 01:42:50,250
I feel like there's a lot more console players than I
thought.

1554
01:42:50,690 --> 01:42:52,310
I thought the main...

1555
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:59,230
I literally thought the main, like, player base was PC.

1556
01:42:59,970 --> 01:43:01,810
But there is, like, a lot more...

1557
01:43:01,810 --> 01:43:04,970
I feel like in the Clobbering Club, it's just all console
players.

1558
01:43:05,870 --> 01:43:06,870
I like to hang out here.

1559
01:43:07,910 --> 01:43:08,810
It's pretty fun.

1560
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:20,390
Wait, Roachy.

1561
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:28,260
Man, where are the...

1562
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:36,750
I'm hearing like Deadpool's conversation on the side.

1563
01:43:38,370 --> 01:43:38,670
Wow!

1564
01:43:47,510 --> 01:43:48,190
Okay.

1565
01:43:49,790 --> 01:43:50,730
Where is he?

1566
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:51,970
Draw.

1567
01:43:53,290 --> 01:43:54,270
Where are you?

1568
01:43:54,510 --> 01:43:56,190
You know what, I won't fight this tiny shark.

1569
01:43:58,170 --> 01:44:00,090
I'm gonna fight you tiny shark.

1570
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:03,030
I don't like the way you look at me.

1571
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:04,770
And you're so tiny.

1572
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:07,730
Fartmaster MVP.

1573
01:44:07,870 --> 01:44:08,890
I just noticed his name.

1574
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:13,210

All right.

1576
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:17,790
I don't like the way you look at me, Tiny Shark.

1577
01:44:18,990 --> 01:44:19,770
Oh, yeah.

1578
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:21,250
All right.

01:44:23,230 --> 01:44:24,930
Let's try out the Loki strat.

1581
01:44:26,190 --> 01:44:27,470
Let's see if it works.

1582
01:44:30,450 --> 01:44:31,330

He has self-heal.

01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:09,060
He is self-heal for this.

1592
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:09,980

01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:03,510
That's on him.

1606
01:47:04,670 --> 01:47:05,230

1607
01:47:05,630 --> 01:47:06,750
Tiny Shark wins.

1608
01:47:09,510 --> 01:47:09,710

1617
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:29,870

1619
01:47:31,690 --> 01:47:34,270
Bro, this guy literally won Bougar Bash.

1620
01:47:34,650 --> 01:47:37,590
And he went fucking back the grinding rink.

1621
01:47:39,950 --> 01:47:42,670
The grind never stops.

1622
01:47:43,090 --> 01:47:44,570

01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:33,840
You'll need a top notch team to win.

1648
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:34,980
Solo healing.

1649
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:37,320

1657
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:12,120

1659
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:21,380
You know what?

1660
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,900
In celebration of third place...

1661
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:28,680
I'm...

1662
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:31,460

01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:33,920
That's right, today is a...

1664
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:36,740
Today is a special day.

1665
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:39,900
Okay, maybe not now.

1666
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:40,980
I don't know how to do it.

1667
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:41,500
Never mind.

1668
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:42,600
Not right now.

1669
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:45,900
I forgot how to do it.

1670
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:48,740
I was the only... Alright, not...

1671
01:51:48,740 --> 01:51:49,240
Oh.

1672
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:51,900
Oh, see?

1673
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:54,160
This guy didn't even do it right.

1674
01:51:55,340 --> 01:51:57,240
Oh, no, not Spider-Man.

1675
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:02,160
Luna, bro, Invis is open.

1676
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:15,260
Oh, that's sad.

1677
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:17,880
I saw what happened.

1678
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:19,640
Well, I got you.

1679
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:22,680
Guys, I don't think we're winning this.

1680
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:26,160
Guys, it does...

1681
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:28,820
It might look like we might be GG's on...

1682
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:32,220
It might be GG's on Hero Select.

1683
01:52:36,740 --> 01:52:41,040
It might actually be GG's on Hero Select, guys.

1684
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:47,500
Literally, the game started and then hella fucking jumped
off the cliff.

1685
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:50,960
Accidentally, but still, that does not look so good.

1686
01:52:55,250 --> 01:53:01,090

1692
01:53:42,850 --> 01:53:44,930
Hey, so my thing is gone already.

1693
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:47,150

1694
01:53:48,390 --> 01:53:48,730
Alright.

1695
01:53:48,830 --> 01:53:50,170
She's gonna hold in like two seconds probably.

1696
01:53:51,970 --> 01:53:52,570
Oh, she's dead.

1697
01:53:53,350 --> 01:53:53,710
Rocket dead?

1698
01:53:53,790 --> 01:53:54,550
I think she altered.

1699
01:53:55,690 --> 01:53:57,410
I love my brothers.

1700
01:53:57,690 --> 01:53:57,890
I don't know.

1701
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:01,390
Alright, here we go guys.

1702
01:54:01,590 --> 01:54:02,770
We're doing it.

1703
01:54:03,470 --> 01:54:05,250
Wait, they don't...

1704
01:54:05,910 --> 01:54:06,350
Oh.

1705
01:54:07,970 --> 01:54:10,390
I don't think he hit that shit, guys.

1706
01:54:10,790 --> 01:54:11,190
Yay!

1707
01:54:15,550 --> 01:54:18,670
Guys, I don't think she she got the freeze.

1708
01:54:21,650 --> 01:54:22,330
That was awkward.

1709
01:54:23,210 --> 01:54:24,470
That was pretty awkward.

1710
01:54:24,670 --> 01:54:25,230
Not gonna lie.

1711
01:54:25,250 --> 01:54:27,490
Oh, oh, there's a Hawkeye.

1712
01:54:29,870 --> 01:54:31,350
And the temp was me.

1713
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:35,470
Let's get out of the ring, guys.

1714
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:37,910
Surely he doesn't know I'm right here, right?

1715
01:54:39,550 --> 01:54:40,170
That's fine.

1716
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:41,030
Here you go.

1717
01:54:41,910 --> 01:54:43,010
I'm doing my job.

1718
01:54:44,670 --> 01:54:45,970
See, the Hawkeye doesn't know.

1719
01:54:46,110 --> 01:54:46,930
He's so stupid.

1720
01:54:47,030 --> 01:54:47,490
Look at him.

1721
01:54:47,670 --> 01:54:48,290
Oh, my God.

1722
01:54:48,430 --> 01:54:49,370
That's... Oh, my God.

1723
01:54:49,410 --> 01:54:50,150
I think he knew.

1724
01:54:50,470 --> 01:54:50,890
I...

1725
01:54:52,590 --> 01:54:54,250
I think he started to know.

1726
01:54:54,290 --> 01:54:54,550
Don't worry.

1727
01:54:55,250 --> 01:55:04,870
right here look at that look at that that namor does not

01:56:00,790 --> 01:56:02,730
How is he still alive?

1734
01:56:04,030 --> 01:56:04,490
Oh.

1735
01:56:05,770 --> 01:56:07,330
Let's do it!

1736
01:56:08,350 --> 01:56:08,630
Oh.

1737
01:56:09,970 --> 01:56:10,970
She should live.

1738
01:56:11,490 --> 01:56:12,690
Yeah, she should live.

1739
01:56:13,830 --> 01:56:15,390
Oh, that...

1740
01:56:15,390 --> 01:56:16,670
That is...

1741
01:56:16,670 --> 01:56:19,610
Oh my god.

1742
01:56:21,230 --> 01:56:31,730
my guy right after this tournament all the things i'm seeing
today it's a whole it's a whole nother fucking environment

1743
01:56:31,730 --> 01:56:49,390
what what am i looking at what am i looking at from this
game oh my god i feel like we can kill her right yeah what

1744
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:52,010
the fuck out of game is this.

1745
01:56:52,690 --> 01:56:54,150
It feels like yeah, it does.

1746
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:58,610
It feels like a fucking totally different game right now.

1747
01:56:59,830 --> 01:57:00,970
It really does.

1748
01:57:01,630 --> 01:57:05,650
It feels like these people, both my team doesn't have hands.

1749
01:57:07,210 --> 01:57:09,590
From the highs of pros to seeing.

1750
01:57:09,970 --> 01:57:13,570
The thing is, Celestial 1 is top 500 right now.

1751
01:57:13,750 --> 01:57:18,130
And I'm Celestial 2, Celestial 1 game.

1752
01:57:18,570 --> 01:57:20,990
So like, that's a little embarrassing

1753
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:33,990
The fact that Celestia 1 is top 500 and I'm in a Celestia 1
to Celestia 2 lobby.

1754
01:57:39,990 --> 01:57:41,990
It's a little...

1755
01:57:43,450 --> 01:57:45,090
That's crazy.

1756
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:46,870
Little...

1757
01:57:46,870 --> 01:57:48,170
Little...

1758
01:57:48,170 --> 01:57:48,370
Yeah.

1759
01:57:49,990 --> 01:57:50,030
Little.

1760
01:57:54,790 --> 01:58:13,530
weird now I know why pro players occupy 200 slots in top 500
now I know that's how you know the power creep the bottom

1761
01:58:13,530 --> 01:58:25,570
top 500 is like this and then like the gap between bottom
500 to pro top 500 or the bottom top 500 from the highest

1762
01:58:25,570 --> 01:58:34,490
levels of deboker bash to literally to literally a top five
like not top 500 i mean this celeste 2 celeste 1 so

1763
01:58:34,490 --> 01:58:45,210
technically no i've just been playing i just somehow got
into this elo like i said i just play it on and uh i don't

1764
01:58:45,210 --> 01:58:53,510
play it every day I just play like whenever I tournament
practice or like sponsors, I play it like literally right

1765
01:58:53,510 --> 01:59:02,750
now Hey guys, will you guys be okay?

1766
01:59:06,330 --> 01:59:08,290
I don't know if these guys would be okay.

1767
01:59:08,410 --> 01:59:09,530
They don't see me, right?

1768
01:59:10,470 --> 01:59:12,510
They don't know I'm here.

1769
01:59:14,130 --> 01:59:15,490
Well, my team's dead.

1770
01:59:16,790 --> 01:59:17,830
They don't know I'm right.

1771
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:20,350
They don't they don't they know They don't!

1772
01:59:20,550 --> 01:59:21,130
They don't!

1773
01:59:21,370 --> 01:59:21,950
They don't!

1774
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:23,850
Why did you bring them in here!

1775
01:59:26,470 --> 01:59:33,090
They don't know,

1776
01:59:40,910 --> 01:59:40,970
right?

1777
01:59:43,490 --> 01:59:44,730
They don't know.

1778
01:59:47,530 --> 01:59:48,730
Oh shit!

1779
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:49,690
We don't work!

1780
01:59:49,710 --> 01:59:50,650
I'm here.

1781
01:59:54,330 --> 01:59:57,990
I thought, to be fair, I just think, I thought most of my
teammates were alive.

1782
01:59:59,390 --> 02:00:00,390
They found us.

1783
02:00:02,270 --> 02:00:07,150
I thought I had my rest of my teammates alive there.

1784
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:09,690
And I was like, oh, wait, am I the only one left?

1785
02:00:10,070 --> 02:00:11,110
Oh, that's awkward.

1786
02:00:12,030 --> 02:00:13,950
That was, that's pretty awkward.

1787
02:00:16,110 --> 02:00:19,330
I thought, I thought I had two more with me.

1788
02:00:19,710 --> 02:00:20,130
You know?

1789
02:00:21,430 --> 02:00:25,450
Yes, I might have saw them, but I legitimately thought there
were still two more.

1790
02:00:26,770 --> 02:00:27,710
Oh, no.

1791
02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:28,790
Aluna did.

1792
02:00:29,990 --> 02:00:30,970
Aluna's back.

1793
02:00:33,910 --> 02:00:37,070
Like, in my head, I thought there was still two more.

1794
02:00:37,830 --> 02:00:38,850
Oh, shit.

1795
02:00:39,810 --> 02:00:41,270

02:00:44,950 --> 02:00:46,230
Like, I'll just stay here.

1799
02:00:46,410 --> 02:00:48,550

Goddamn Spider-Man players griefing my games.

Those menaces of society.

They truly are.

1906
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:31,280
What I feel like, I don't know.

1907
02:08:31,460 --> 02:08:33,900
That game was fucking weird.

1908
02:08:34,260 --> 02:08:35,740
Oh yeah, look at my...

1909
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:36,560
Okay, not that.

1910
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:40,980
That was when it started getting late.

1911
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:45,100
But other than that, it was pretty clean.

1912
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:47,480
It was pretty clean before it did.

1913
02:08:47,560 --> 02:08:48,540
This was clean.

1914
02:08:49,140 --> 02:08:50,720
This was pretty clean.

1915
02:08:51,380 --> 02:08:52,500
All solo queue.

1916
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:55,020
And then, like, it got too late.

1917
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:57,640
The time, it got a little too late.

1918
02:08:57,720 --> 02:08:58,640
And I got tired.

1919
02:08:58,860 --> 02:08:59,520
I got EP.

1920
02:09:00,260 --> 02:09:02,920
It was pretty clean.

1921
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:04,160
And then I got EP.

1922
02:09:04,420 --> 02:09:06,520
See, Celestial Water's top 500.

1923
02:09:07,580 --> 02:09:08,700

02:09:28,980 --> 02:09:30,140
Melee only.

1933
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:33,400
I mean, their DPS did work.

1934
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:38,000

Alright, here we go.

2022
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:38,000
Here we go.

2023
02:20:45,420 --> 02:20:46,140
Let's go.

2024
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:48,140
You know, I'm tempted.

2025
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:49,140
I like going...

2026
02:20:49,140 --> 02:20:50,220
I've been thinking...

2027
02:20:50,220 --> 02:20:54,100
I'm sorry, I had a Jeff, AFK, and spawn before spawn doors
open.

2028
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:01,480
Guys, this is why I put on streamer mode.

2029
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:03,720
So I let them say their shit.

2030
02:21:05,180 --> 02:21:10,800
streamer modes and then they apologize it's cool

2031
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:23,820
this is why i use streamer mode because i love it when that
happens

2032
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:30,740
you can't blame

2033
02:21:35,740 --> 02:21:36,940
Oh shit!

2034
02:21:40,900 --> 02:21:47,740
Because he was the one that was like, you know you can, you
know you can put your thing down, right?

2035
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:50,980
Because he's super fast.

2036
02:21:51,300 --> 02:21:57,860
And I was like, I heard he's a teenager, so like, that's why
he says shit like that.

2037
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:04,220
Going back with hello.

2038
02:22:15,860 --> 02:22:23,820
You guys, this is the reason why Ghost Tree for more just to
see the back settle.

2039
02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:26,140
It works every time.

2040
02:22:26,620 --> 02:22:34,940
When I see like someone, like, because they're a pro player,
when I see like a pro player does that, I'll be like, I...

2041
02:22:35,180 --> 02:22:39,180
But it only happens when I stream.

2042
02:22:39,780 --> 02:22:43,900
The only worst part is that when I'm streaming, they
apologize.

2043
02:22:48,360 --> 02:22:50,040
Character development.

2044
02:22:52,780 --> 02:22:58,800
That's why whenever I get flamed by, like, a pro, I go live
afterwards.

2045
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:00,680
Turn, move, move.

2046
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:04,640
Are you fucking against?

2047
02:23:07,640 --> 02:23:17,460
I can't No, I don't turn off No, I did turn off streamer
mode I meant like After I got No, it's like My streamer mode

2048
02:23:17,460 --> 02:23:24,860
It goes My streamer mode goes off After a couple Like after
a couple of minutes Because it's like The streamer mode only

2049
02:23:24,860 --> 02:23:33,220
hides For like hero select In the first two minutes of the
game And then after that My name gets revealed And then

2050
02:23:33,220 --> 02:23:41,280
usually people backpedal Yeah, I- they- it's the back pedal
after that.

2051
02:23:44,140 --> 02:23:47,280
That's why I'm- I love it when it happens.

2052
02:23:48,420 --> 02:23:51,640
I- I fucking love it when that happens.

2053
02:23:54,100 --> 02:23:56,180
Oh, we should live, right?

2054
02:23:56,380 --> 02:23:57,260
You're fine.

2055
02:23:57,560 --> 02:23:57,960
There you go.

2056
02:24:06,040 --> 02:24:07,860

2060
02:24:18,500 --> 02:24:22,600
Oh my god, oh I lived.

2061
02:24:22,880 --> 02:24:25,020

02:27:13,660 --> 02:27:15,860
Shit is fucking funny.

2111
02:27:17,360 --> 02:27:19,560
This is why I turned on streamer mode.

2112
02:27:20,360 --> 02:27:22,100
This is exactly why I turned on streamer mode.

2113
02:27:22,120 --> 02:27:23,940
They're not streamers.

2114
02:27:25,620 --> 02:27:26,500
I look.

2115
02:27:26,940 --> 02:27:29,020
I think it's fucking hilarious.

2116
02:27:29,700 --> 02:27:31,620
The reveal is always worth it.

2117
02:27:32,080 --> 02:27:33,140
It really is.

2118
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:48,500
What if you get top five?

2119
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:48,960
Nah.

2120
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:50,520
Dude, that's too much work.

2121
02:27:51,460 --> 02:27:52,700
I don't got time for that.

2122
02:27:52,840 --> 02:27:54,720
Next week is my anniversary, guys.

2123
02:27:56,440 --> 02:27:59,720

2126
02:28:04,900 --> 02:28:05,620

2127
02:28:05,880 --> 02:28:06,580
Wait, that's true.

02:28:06,620 --> 02:28:07,080

2129
02:28:07,380 --> 02:28:09,100

2130
02:28:10,340 --> 02:28:11,540

2131
02:28:19,250 --> 02:28:19,550

2132
02:28:20,030 --> 02:28:21,610

goal and like we got third.

2162
02:30:47,170 --> 02:30:53,750

2163
02:30:53,750 --> 02:30:54,190
depressed.

cloaks like Kloekski, right?

2170
02:31:26,430 --> 02:31:34,530
From the lowest of the low the worst team in the entire
tournament and apparently Their captains were like, this

2171
02:31:34,530 --> 02:31:39,330
team is bad because they picked and drafted wrong.

2172
02:31:39,830 --> 02:31:42,590

2173
02:31:42,750 --> 02:31:44,190

2174
02:31:47,750 --> 02:31:52,070
