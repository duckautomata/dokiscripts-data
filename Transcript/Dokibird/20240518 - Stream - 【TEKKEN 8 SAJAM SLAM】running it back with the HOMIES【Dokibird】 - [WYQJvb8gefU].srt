1
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:11,650
The team that is in last place is only five games behind the team that is in first place.

2
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,850
I'm muted by the way.

3
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,210
Instead of three points for win, it's five.

4
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,930
You know what team that is?

5
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,250
That's me!

6
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,750
That is Miles' team.

7
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:30,490
Which is... if you, for instance, if Miles' team played Brawl Pro's team, who's in first place right now, and 5-0'd them, then they would go from last to first, and Brawl Pro's team would no longer be in first place.

8
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:40,670
So there's a huge amount of points on the line today to incentivize playing the first day, then learning, then coming back on Friday, playing again, and then getting a cheating for Sunday.

9
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,070
So you'll be playing everybody again today.

10
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,850
All of you did this on Wednesday, so you're all experienced and you know how to do it now.

11
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,170
We've all done this together before.

12
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:58,070
And then this is your chance to beat up the people who got you on Wednesday and show off the stuff that you've learned and work with your coaches and get some new stuff, some new data.

13
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,670
And it's all worth more points.

14
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,470
So it's going to be...

15
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,110
really important.

16
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,250
Every game is really, really important.

17
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,050
No, I pressed the wrong button!

18
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,070
I took a screenshot!

19
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,550
Five points is a ton of points.

20
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,170
So...

21
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,250
I'm scared.

22
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:09,870
Good luck out there.

23
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,370
Yay!

24
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,410
No pressure.

25
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:12,710
Right.

26
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,350
I was about to say...

27
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,610
Yeah, no pressure.

28
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,090
Sorry, we're just sitting on intel.

29
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:17,970
Almost double.

30
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,170
It's like double jeopardy, basically.

31
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,470
Everything is worth almost double.

32
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,350
My fifth move!

33
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,570
I learned the low-key chat!

34
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,430
That is my fifth move!

35
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,930
I do this!

36
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,370
Boom, boom, boom, boom!

37
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,570
And then I do this!

38
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,810
This is my fifth move!

39
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,430
The fifth move!

40
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,910
And I think for a lot of people tomorrow, if you're in the LA area...

41
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,790
And then I do...

42
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,230
And then I do this!

43
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,530
And then I do this!

44
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,550
That is my fifth move!

45
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,890
I'm not listening, by the way.

46
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,250
They're talking about setup stuff.

47
00:03:59,330 --> 00:03:59,910
I'm fucking going.

48
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,290
I'm grinding.

49
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,290
Oh, damn.

50
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,590
Dude, Steve's doing it.

51
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,630
I'm on my way to tribe over there.

52
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,530
Pull up.

53
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,750
Make the trip.

54
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,950
But yeah, otherwise, any questions?

55
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,130
Anything anybody needs to know?

56
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,030
Or are we done with the game?

57
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,090
If I lose any matches, I blame BrawlPro's absence.

58
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,030
Okay.

59
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:16,790
Yeah.

60
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,590
I'm with you.

61
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,310
Let's go moral some hell.

62
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,950
What the hell, bro?

63
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,490
Open trash can.

64
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,830
What have I ever done to you?

65
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,790
Open trash can.

66
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,410
Damn.

67
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,470
No, I like that.

68
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,730
That's my teammate right there.

69
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,950
No, no, no.

70
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,790
Yeah, so we talked about prizes.

71
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,690
I talked about it on my stream.

72
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,570
Oh my god, please.

73
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,510
I can't see.

74
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,430
Is this guy on Wi-Fi?

75
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,070
Is it me?

76
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,430
I can't tell.

77
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,210
I can't see.

78
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,670
You can pay to get the EVO.

79
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,530
For flight, hotel, registration.

80
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,290
I mean, you can choose whether or not you want to enter the tournament.

81
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,070
That's up to you.

82
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,750
If you want to play in Tekken or some other games with EVO, you definitely can.

83
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:51,750
It's okay.

84
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,710
My fifth move is going to come in clutch.

85
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,570
For teams in first and second, they are from junk food.

86
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,890
For teams in third and fourth, they are from custom controllers from FCM and Granola.

87
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,090
And for everybody in the tournament.

88
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,290
We all sent you Chipotle codes today.

89
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,850
I'm sorry if you're in Canada, by the way.

90
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:08,970
Chipotle!

91
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,630
Chipotle, it's fine.

92
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,730
But we also have something for everybody.

93
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,690
There's a prize.

94
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,150
I'll be showing it off on Sunday.

95
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,630
But we have something that we want to give everybody for participating.

96
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,890
And then everybody for participating is also going to get two gift subs depending on where your team place is.

97
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,070
So it doesn't matter what.

98
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,010
You'll get something physical and something digital.

99
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,390
Oh god.

100
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,750
You can't duck this again because you don't learn.

101
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,830
Nobody learns.

102
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,570
Oh my gosh.

103
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,550
It depends on how your team does today.

104
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,290
It's okay.

105
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,950
My fifth move right here.

106
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,430
Oh shit.

107
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:44,770
Okay.

108
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,790
My fifth move right... Oh, never mind.

109
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,830
Oh my god.

110
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,210
Never mind.

111
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,310
I'm so sorry.

112
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,430
Are you ready?

113
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,130
Let's game.

114
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,690
Good luck everybody.

115
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:55,950
Goodbye.

116
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,710
Wait, everybody's leaving but I'm going to win all the games.

117
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:02,990
Good luck gamers.

118
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,610
I'm going to win all the games.

119
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:06,770
Oh god.

120
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:09,850
Okay.

121
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,570
And then...

122
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,430
And then...

123
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,370
And then...

124
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,290
And then...

125
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,930
And then I can do it again.

126
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,350
And then...

127
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,820
Without him like yelling in my ear.

128
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,400
Oh my gosh.

129
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,660
Hello everybody.

130
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,100
Sorry, I'm like in the game.

131
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,460
Hey, congrats on Dango-sh or whatever.

132
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,300
Oh my god.

133
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,080
I did it.

134
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,940
I learned a fifth move and it's actually coming in clutch.

135
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,140
What's your new move?

136
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,560
What did we...

137
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,320
The low kick.

138
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,780
I just spam the low kick.

139
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,140
And then I'm...

140
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,720
Spam the low kick into a hop kick.

141
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,440
Oh, that's good.

142
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,920
Wait, do you have the hop kick combo?

143
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

144
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,960
I figured it out.

145
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,520
I learned.

146
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,420
Good.

147
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,560
I can't wait to see it.

148
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,720
Now the question is can I use it in like actual like on our players?

149
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,680
You're probably going to get obliterated by ESAM.

150
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,720
Oh, 100%.

151
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,220
That guy hit purple.

152
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,320
That guy hit purple.

153
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,760
Everybody else, I think you're good.

154
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,440
I think you're good.

155
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,040
Why the fuck is he in my elo?

156
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,580
I don't know.

157
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,140
This match should be facing slime or you.

158
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,460
Yeah.

159
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,260
I think they didn't expect him to get good.

160
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,760
So fast because like it's his first time but...

161
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,640
But he comes from fighting games.

162
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,200
Like what?

163
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,420
Yeah, he's a dork.

164
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,160
He's a big dork and he cares a lot which means you should put them high.

165
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,960
You know what I mean?

166
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,200
He should get like a handicap.

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,220
Or I should get the handicap.

168
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:41,880
One more?

169
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:41,940
Yeah.

170
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,840
Like if you win one round, it's over.

171
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,280
Yeah, exactly.

172
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,840
If I get one round, I win both sets.

173
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,780
That should be the handicap.

174
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,100
You guys talking about Shemesh?

175
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,300
Shemesh man?

176
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,600
Hell yeah.

177
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,440
Shemesh man?

178
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,480
Shemesh man?

179
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:58,980
It's not fair.

180
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,420
Why am I facing that guy?

181
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,960
No, he's... you got it.

182
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,280
What do you mean?

183
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,880
Don't worry about it.

184
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,180
She doesn't.

185
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,620
She doesn't.

186
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:08,900
It's okay.

187
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,960
What the fuck?

188
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,960
No, dude.

189
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,760
He's purple.

190
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,660
Yeah, what the fuck am I gonna do?

191
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,520
Purple means nothing.

192
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,560
Purple means nothing right now.

193
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,380
Purple means nothing?

194
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,700
No, purple's really good actually.

195
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,400
Yeah, what do you mean?

196
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,580
The co- is it Cody purple?

197
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,940
That's where really good players are.

198
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,220
Yeah.

199
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,560
They're really good though.

200
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,820
You're right.

201
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,080
You're right.

202
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,000
Purple means nothing.

203
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:26,800
I'm gonna go get my co-.

204
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,920
That means you mean nothing, Cody.

205
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,220
I just think... I think he's gonna mash the hell out of you and there's not gonna...

206
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,700
Like, law is just buttons.

207
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,860
He's just gonna kick you.

208
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,780
But good luck.

209
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,820
Bro, am I even gonna touch him?

210
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:39,960
No.

211
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,020
My goal is to hit him one time.

212
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,760
You went 2-3.

213
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,420
Oh, wait.

214
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,200
Did I went 2-3?

215
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,780
I did.

216
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,360
Yeah.

217
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,780
Because he couldn't predict me because I didn't know what I was doing.

218
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,560
So, he didn't know what I was doing.

219
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,280
Hold on.

220
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,320
I gotta show my chat something.

221
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,640
One sec.

222
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,660
Oh my god.

223
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:06,900
Please.

224
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,800
Alissa, please.

225
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,450
Oh my god.

226
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,690
I'm messing up.

227
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,370
Oh my god.

228
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,530
I muted myself.

229
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,390
I got scared.

230
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,790
I thought... I pictured her as ESAM.

231
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,130
Even though ESAM doesn't even play Alissa.

232
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,130
I fucking hate Alissa.

233
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,190
I hate... They're too fast!

234
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,930
You're too fucking fast!

235
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,110
Stop!

236
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,850
Fucking stop!

237
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,710
Someone turn it off!

238
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,250
Oh god.

239
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:45,730
It's okay.

240
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,110
Oh my god.

241
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,850
I can't do my special...

242
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,550
It's so true.

243
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,270
Does anyone know how much it is to buy tears in this game?

244
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,310
Like in the battle pass?

245
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,350
No, right?

246
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,370
Do you guys spend money?

247
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:05,570
So, there's a tulip at level 54 that goes on your head.

248
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,230
And I could make myself a Pikmin.

249
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,510
And I want it real bad.

250
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,490
But not if it's like $300.

251
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,370
You know what I'm saying?

252
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,090
Like...

253
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:13,770
Wait.

254
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,330
How many tears do you have to buy?

255
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,450
Uh... A lot.

256
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,390
Let me see.

257
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,930
We'll increase battle pass by 20.

258
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,650
That's 2,000 tokens.

259
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,930
If I do that, I'll be at 59.

260
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,970
Also, apparently we're supposed to join the lobby.

261
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,550
Oh, whoops.

262
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,270
Alright, one sec.

263
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:32,730
Okay.

264
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,250
I just got here to...

265
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:34,890
Oh shit!

266
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,190
Welcome back!

267
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,730
Howdy, coach!

268
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,610
Yo, what's up?

269
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,550
You just spend your money.

270
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:40,570
You should do it.

271
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,070
20 bucks for a Pikmin, dude?

272
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,010
Okay, but what about the content?

273
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,070
You could put that on your thumbnail.

274
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,230
Thumbnail?

275
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:49,770
Yeah!

276
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,630
You could use that as your thumbnail!

277
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:52,770
I guess so.

278
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,930
For your highlights!

279
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,630
And then the title would be, I spent how much in Tekken 8?

280
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,330
Oh, wait!

281
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,950
No, I need more than that!

282
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,530
No, because I'm at 29.

283
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,790
I need to get to 56.

284
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:08,830
It would be...

285
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,070
Dude, that's expensive.

286
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,270
It's like 40 bucks.

287
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:11,970
Holy shit.

288
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,230
You'll earn it back on your YouTube highlights.

289
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,470
You'll earn it back.

290
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,150
Not on this video.

291
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,370
Nobody's clicking on that.

292
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,890
Unfortunately, we went crazy.

293
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,030
Scarra said that he's gonna rip off his shirt if he wins against Beast.

294
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,010
I'm gonna have to throw.

295
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:25,250
I'm playing against Sean.

296
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,890
I have to activate good timeline.

297
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,470
I'm sorry.

298
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,810
It's just I need to see it happen.

299
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,010
Okay, okay, okay.

300
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,330
I'm back.

301
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:33,570
I'm back.

302
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:33,850
I'm back.

303
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,550
Wait, why am I playing against fucking Sean?

304
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,190
I don't know.

305
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,630
Wait, what?

306
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,170
Okay, I'm gonna...

307
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,630
That's not the match.

308
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,410
Yeah, this is not my match.

309
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,910
We didn't train for that guy.

310
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,350
Yeah, I didn't train for him.

311
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,470
I'm gonna play like Eddy.

312
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,050
I don't know what I'm doing.

313
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,130
Please play King.

314
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:57,570
Okay.

315
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,030
Get in there.

316
00:11:59,210 --> 00:11:59,690
Let's go.

317
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,250
Let's go.

318
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,050
I have Eddy locked in.

319
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,830
This is stage one, two, three.

320
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,470
I never played this character in my life.

321
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,210
Let's fucking go.

322
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,310
We haven't even started.

323
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:11,990
This is a...

324
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,750
Isn't it Kaiser's lobby?

325
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,550
Oh my God.

326
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,990
Yeah.

327
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,130
He's doing that thing.

328
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,010
Oh, I see what you mean.

329
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:18,470
Stage three.

330
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,030
Oh my God.

331
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,130
He's doing the thing I do.

332
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,510
I thought you meant like what two.

333
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,850
Oh my God.

334
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,670
This character is gross.

335
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,870
Oh my God.

336
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,950
No, I don't have...

337
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,770
Oh my God.

338
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,490
Is this how people feel?

339
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,950
That's what you do.

340
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,030
That's what you do.

341
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,230
That's what I do.

342
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,410
Let's go.

343
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,050
Oh my God.

344
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,250
Oh no, it's five rounds.

345
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,550
Please.

346
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:40,470
Please.

347
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,110
What is happening?

348
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:42,930
I don't know.

349
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,310
Secret rule set that I wasn't aware of.

350
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,110
Five rounds of Toys R Us.

351
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:47,750
Oh my God.

352
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,590
Now I know how other people feel when they play against me.

353
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,770
I know.

354
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,970
It's a test round?

355
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,050
I don't understand what's happening.

356
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:56,750
I don't know.

357
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,910
I guess.

358
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,670
They accidentally made a lobby with five, so they don't think it's a test.

359
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:02,950
Yeah.

360
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,390
Oh.

361
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,150
I've never seen five dots up there.

362
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,950
How high can it go?

363
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,910
It can't go to seven, right?

364
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:12,450
That'd be crazy.

365
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,230
That should be the finals.

366
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,550
First to seven.

367
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:16,830
Yeah.

368
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,110
First to seven.

369
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,530
A lot of adaptation going on there.

370
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,570
Oh my God.

371
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,150
You know what?

372
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,550
Maybe King is bullshit.

373
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,570
Holy shit.

374
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,370
I mean, he's definitely good.

375
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,490
Oh my gosh.

376
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,370
I didn't want people to know how my fifth move.

377
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,810
I went to the bathroom, guys.

378
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,090
I feel like I'm going to barf.

379
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,210
Oh, they're waiting for you to say... oh yeah, he went to the bathroom.

380
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:54,790
Okay.

381
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,240
Get him!

382
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,520
3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3!

383
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,640
I can't!

384
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,280
He's just grabbing me!

385
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,580
True?

386
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:07,940
Wow.

387
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,740
Oh my god!

388
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,920
This game is truly unfair.

389
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,160
Holy shit, somebody nerf King, please!

390
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,240
You know, we should really ban this character.

391
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,360
Kronix is like, you know what, maybe I just play this guy instead.

392
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,180
He has a shotgun?!

393
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,880
Wait, where did he get the shotgun?!

394
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,720
I think he likes to apple his hammer into shotgun.

395
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,440
It's a cosmetic, you can use it once.

396
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,260
They're legal in the tournament!

397
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,100
Wait, how do I get a shotgun?

398
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,120
Don't.

399
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,620
Do not.

400
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,840
You're not allowed.

401
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,840
She's like, smacking her lips like, hmmm.

402
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,840
You need a license.

403
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,260
Hmmmm.

404
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,820
I'm from Canada, I don't...

405
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,520
The tournament's gonna be over, so...

406
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,180
I don't know how I feel, I'm from Canada.

407
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:52,800
Hahaha!

408
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,840
Oh, look.

409
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,560
I can't believe it.

410
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,240
He showed me what a true King player can do.

411
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,740
He doesn't even play King, what the fuck?

412
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,230
He doesn't even play King, what the fuck?

413
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,090
I can't believe it, guys.

414
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,130
You know, maybe King is bullshit.

415
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,030
Hahaha!

416
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:16,530
Chat!

417
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,050
Maybe King was...

418
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:19,910
Maybe King was...

419
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,270
King is pretty bullshit.

420
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:22,330
Hahaha!

421
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:23,890
Hahaha!

422
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,950
Right to bear arms, America.

423
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:29,570
Right to bear arms, America.

424
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,310
Fuck yeah.

425
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,890
Wait, wait, wait, who are you fighting?

426
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,430
Okay, back.

427
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,090
I am...

428
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,950
I'm fighting Amor, I'm pretty sure, right?

429
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:41,830
Where...

430
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,310
Oh.

431
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,450
Join the lobby, Amor!

432
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,630
Wait.

433
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,070
Oh, right, right, that's so stupid.

434
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,970
We're making a different one.

435
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:50,770
Why is this a five round?

436
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,270
Oh, because we're on five rounds.

437
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,990
Yeah, five rounds, so we gotta make a new one.

438
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,930
Freaking Kaiser, man.

439
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,270
What the heck.

440
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,310
Oh my god, you should have been making the lobby, BrawlPro.

441
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,210
Yeah, but he wasn't here.

442
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,210
Wow.

443
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,650
So unprofessional.

444
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:13,330
I was telling everyone that like, if I lose any, I blame you for lack of team support.

445
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:13,770
Yeah.

446
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,890
My morale is so low now because you were late.

447
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:18,450
Yeah.

448
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,050
I'm not gonna lie.

449
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,650
I've been late to pretty much everything my whole life.

450
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,030
I swear, dude.

451
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,970
If I lose, we blame BrawlPro.

452
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,710
Hold on, I'm just learning something about you, Doki.

453
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,390
Someone said your fanbase is called Dragoons?

454
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:36,830
Yeah!

455
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,090
And it's shortened to Goons?

456
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:39,990
Yeah, oh.

457
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:40,930
No.

458
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

459
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,330
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

460
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,030
Who told you that?

461
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,610
There's a double agent here.

462
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,890
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

463
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,570
There's nothing wrong with commanding an army of goons.

464
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,950
Someone say it's a little bit respectable depending on how you feel about it.

465
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,350
Are you one of them?

466
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,330
Are you one of them, Matt?

467
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,810
Are you a gooner?

468
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,310
Are you a gooner?

469
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:10,990
He's on the inside!

470
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,130
He's on the inside!

471
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,570
He's been gooning.

472
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,210
Alright, I'm losing.

473
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,250
I'm throwing every single one.

474
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,210
Come on!

475
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,930
Oh, wait.

476
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,270
He got caught.

477
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,130
Wait, why are the shirtless?

478
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,410
Why am I supposed to play?

479
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,670
I got so used to the shirt.

480
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,950
The no shirt.

481
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,010
Bought some clothes, just popped into a store.

482
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,370
Yeah, this is not fair.

483
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,810
What is this script?

484
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:45,850
Oh my god.

485
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,270
I don't like this.

486
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,650
Now that she doesn't have a shirt, I don't like this anymore.

487
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:53,950
You guys started right away?

488
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:54,830
Yeah.

489
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,390
Are we?

490
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,330
Okay!

491
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,430
Are we supposed to not start?

492
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,670
No, no, no.

493
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,070
Fuck them up.

494
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,630
Because I don't know anymore.

495
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,270
Up the dokerooty!

496
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,510
Yay!

497
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,670
Slow that shit down.

498
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:15,990
Let's go.

499
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,150
Oh my god.

500
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,930
I'm a little delayed.

501
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,350
Oh my god.

502
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,310
She's doing that thing.

503
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,970
Okay, I've never seen that.

504
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,510
Me too.

505
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,630
I've never seen that either.

506
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,530
I was like, what?

507
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,490
Oh my god.

508
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,150
She's doing...

509
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,510
She's pulling that off of me.

510
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,130
Oh, no way that hopkick.

511
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,210
Bro, she keeps hopkicking.

512
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,050
I was supposed to hopkick.

513
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:39,990
This is not fair.

514
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,290
This is my first game of the day.

515
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:41,790
Okay.

516
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,310
Anyway, and now I back up.

517
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,350
Wait, actually, no.

518
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,610
I don't.

519
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,350
Now you go in.

520
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,070
Oh, shit!

521
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,350
Oh my god.

522
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,530
I got it!

523
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:55,910
Let's go.

524
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,090
Wait, you won?

525
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,990
Yeah, I won that fight.

526
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,830
Me too.

527
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,010
I honestly thought so too.

528
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:03,850
I was so surprised.

529
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,850
One more?

530
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,190
One more?

531
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:06,890
Okay.

532
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,170
Oh my god.

533
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,190
That was not ready.

534
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,150
Perfect.

535
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,590
You're insane.

536
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,430
I told you the fifth move is all it takes.

537
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,050
We're getting another game?

538
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:21,650
Let's go.

539
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,350
It's the fifth move.

540
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,710
Nobody expects it.

541
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,770
It was Unk being like, here's a fifth one.

542
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:34,050
And she was like, It's like a Zelda game.

543
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,570
It comes out of the chest and it's just your whole game plan now.

544
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,110
Yeah, that's just it.

545
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,170
You're gonna use it in the next boss.

546
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,190
Yeah, you gotta use it everywhere.

547
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,530
Yeah, they've like planned for four moves, but they've never planned for the fifth one.

548
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,770
They never...

549
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,810
It like mixed them up.

550
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,070
The mental stack is too high.

551
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,950
Imagine if I learned a sixth move.

552
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,710
Get your ass out of there.

553
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,150
Yeah.

554
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,330
But you better take off your shirt.

555
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,010
I wanted a turn.

556
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,390
That game was not a fun.

557
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,410
You wanna get in all the king action.

558
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,170
Two jaguars and a bear.

559
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,770
And a robot.

560
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,810
We're gonna Eiffel Tower.

561
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:15,010
Slime.

562
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,130
The goon accusations really held weight.

563
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,390
Oh my goodness.

564
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,410
It might just be true.

565
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,370
Where the fuck is...

566
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,130
Where is Amore?

567
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,770
Wait, she's gone.

568
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,890
Oh no, she's over there.

569
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,950
Slime, get out.

570
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,910
Slime really wants to play.

571
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,410
He's itching, man.

572
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,230
He heard about the king sandwich.

573
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,930
He heard about the king sandwich.

574
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,710
He's that guy at the rotation that plugs in before anybody asks him to.

575
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,310
GG.

576
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,810
This is tournament, bro.

577
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,030
He takes four puffs.

578
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:53,890
Is this CTaken?

579
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,630
You ever have somebody go like, is this tournament?

580
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:00,330
And you're like, yeah.

581
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:00,910
And they're like, alright.

582
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:01,950
And they sit down anyway.

583
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:03,910
What?

584
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,150
GG shake my hand and tell the TL you won.

585
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,610
I mean, I don't mind if he plays for me.

586
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,910
Oh my god, she took all the tricks.

587
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:20,030
Oh my god, thank you.

588
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,530
I was like...

589
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,450
The sixth secret move.

590
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,110
JK, I had a secret sixth move.

591
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,090
This is like the millennia's naked phase two.

592
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,070
The king scarlet rot.

593
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,830
Oh no.

594
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,750
Oh no.

595
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,770
The fifth move.

596
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,190
There we go.

597
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,810
But she uses this against me.

598
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:40,490
Don't do that anymore.

599
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,590
Don't do that anymore.

600
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,770
That was only on my professional level.

601
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,370
Oh my god.

602
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,210
Wait.

603
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,090
Wait.

604
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:51,650
No.

605
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,490
That would have been humongous.

606
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,770
Okay, remove the sixth move.

607
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,670
Stick to the fifth one.

608
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,190
But it's so funny.

609
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,130
You know what?

610
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,530
Maybe keep doing it.

611
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,310
I told you.

612
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,170
You guys didn't believe.

613
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:09,870
Maybe keep doing it.

614
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,790
You guys didn't believe.

615
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:12,790
Oh my god.

616
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:20,590
Why did you believe?

617
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,670
Why did you believe?

618
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:21,810
Why did you believe?

619
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,110
My fault.

620
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,710
It's like you put three mom up, but you put in five eggs.

621
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,050
Eggs, eggs, eggs.

622
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:28,890
Exactly.

623
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,130
But she doesn't.

624
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:31,670
They don't learn.

625
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,450
That's the thing.

626
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,910
This is a delicious omelet.

627
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,790
Oh my god.

628
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,670
They had the answer and then they stopped having the answer.

629
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,390
And now they remember it again.

630
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,050
Oh no.

631
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,010
They're downloading me.

632
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,190
Oh what the fuck?

633
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,590
King versus king.

634
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,730
What the fuck?

635
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,030
Do it now.

636
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,750
I stepped.

637
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:54,870
Fight.

638
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,470
Yes.

639
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,490
And then I do the sixth move.

640
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,710
What the fuck?

641
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,430
Oh my god.

642
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,790
That cannot be intentional.

643
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,650
There's no way.

644
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,190
There's no way.

645
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,050
There's no way.

646
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,690
I did the square.

647
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,510
Oh my goodness.

648
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:14,610
Oh.

649
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,130
No, we blocked that.

650
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

651
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,790
Oh, but then she did this to me.

652
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,530
But she keeps doing stuff.

653
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,330
She can do that?

654
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,090
What?

655
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,050
You know what?

656
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,590
It's fine.

657
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:27,930
It's fine.

658
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:28,050
It's all right.

659
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,730
They're both so angry.

660
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:33,850
I know.

661
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,450
Stop being so angry.

662
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,690
Move number seven.

663
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,930
Oh wait, but she like figured it out.

664
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,490
She's figuring it out though.

665
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,850
What the fuck?

666
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,170
No, I mean...

667
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,390
That's three.

668
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:52,690
Stop!

669
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:53,690
Yes.

670
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,810
We did it!

671
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,190
Probably the best Tekken match I've seen in my life.

672
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,410
It worked!

673
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:09,530
It worked.

674
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:09,710
Not a block.

675
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:10,550
You're wrestling!

676
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,610
It works!

677
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,510
What the hell, dude?

678
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,090
They don't learn!

679
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,430
I keep spamming it as long as they don't learn!

680
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,350
That was still sustained.

681
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,570
I don't understand though.

682
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,830
They did learn.

683
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,050
They unlearned.

684
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:22,710
They unlearned it!

685
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,110
They unlearned it and then stopped learning.

686
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,170
They just- okay, it's because they think I would stop doing it, but I'm so stubborn that I kept doing it.

687
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,930
They were so surprised.

688
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,450
That was crazy.

689
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,450
They're like, she eventually will stop, right?

690
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,710
But I didn't, because I was more stubborn.

691
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:38,670
Yeah, cinema.

692
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,110
The game is all about cinema.

693
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,410
Well done.

694
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,750
Okay, I have a real question.

695
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,950
If you get hit by five alley kicks and your character is like...

696
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,310
Who the fuck is this guy?

697
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,230
Is that good?

698
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,430
I think that's one of your fans in here.

699
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,470
If an alley kick leads to a true combo...

700
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,850
We need some attention right now.

701
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,170
We're remaking it because it was first to one.

702
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:58,710
Oh.

703
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,010
Guys are taking two Ls already.

704
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,170
Two bad lobbies?

705
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,670
Wait, so I didn't even need to win that second set?

706
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:07,970
No, you did.

707
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:08,770
But...

708
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,330
You did, you did.

709
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:09,770
Oh.

710
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,830
Oh, the victory conditions.

711
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:12,730
I would have had to go back to the lobby if you did.

712
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,490
All right.

713
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:15,990
Nice.

714
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,910
That was so fucking easy.

715
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,970
You got your one dub speed.

716
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,150
I got my one dub.

717
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,730
I don't have to win again.

718
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:28,550
I already have surpassed Super's record, so I don't need to do anything anymore.

719
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,010
Wait, but for real?

720
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,810
Is the lobby broke for anybody else?

721
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:34,890
Yeah, it's broken.

722
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,770
I can try to make...

723
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:37,950
I can try to make...

724
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,270
I don't trust your lobbies, bro.

725
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,670
Arata, give us Waffle House.

726
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,090
Dude, I wouldn't order something natural.

727
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,910
We might as well just get Cjam to make the lobby.

728
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,110
Kaiser keeps having to edit his code.

729
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,530
He keeps posting a lobby and then having to edit it.

730
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:55,890
What?

731
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,710
He can't do it.

732
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,150
That he didn't mean.

733
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,630
How do you edit a link?

734
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,950
Like in the Discord, he keeps like posting the link and then screwing it up.

735
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:05,610
He's like, oh, my bad.

736
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,530
Did he post the right one?

737
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:07,830
Yeah.

738
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:07,930
I don't know.

739
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,550
We have a password now with the wait.

740
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,550
All right.

741
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:15,190
And we can show the password to everybody, because it's like, yeah, it doesn't matter.

742
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,490
We learned that today.

743
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,090
Yeah.

744
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,070
All right.

745
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,110
I'm going to go to the bathroom while everybody files in.

746
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,270
All right.

747
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,250
Let's go.

748
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:30,510
What did they talk about in the orientation when I was like running late?

749
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,530
They were like, wow, BrawPro is late.

750
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,730
They actually did call you out.

751
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,050
Wait, what?

752
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:37,910
I know that.

753
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,190
And I stood up for you and said Sejem has a hair system.

754
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,130
Which he does.

755
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:41,470
Woah!

756
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,710
I didn't pay attention, I was fucking playing rank.

757
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,990
It's like an FGC like, inside thing that no one talks about.

758
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,750
But I'm breaking this news live today.

759
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:51,970
Alright.

760
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,430
He has a hair system.

761
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,030
And he's bald in real life.

762
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,290
Nice.

763
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,390
I know.

764
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,510
It's not nice, no.

765
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,690
I mean not nice.

766
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:02,790
Embarrassing.

767
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,090
Oh my god.

768
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,590
We already got points.

769
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,690
Look at me go.

770
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,570
We're already running it up.

771
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,590
We're already a positive record.

772
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,810
Alright guys, don't fuck it up now.

773
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,570
I worked very hard for that lead.

774
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,270
Those five alley kicks, I worked very hard for.

775
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:23,910
Okay, rage art done.

776
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:24,870
Points, points, points.

777
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,490
Alright, if I get on that goddamn wall stage again, I'm random-ing off.

778
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,610
That's crazy dude.

779
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:36,970
Do you think, do you think like, you could get away with five alley kicks on turn two?

780
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:37,290
No!

781
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,910
No!

782
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,110
No!

783
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:38,770
No!

784
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:39,890
I might do it!

785
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,490
I might do it, but I don't think I'm gonna get away with it.

786
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:42,730
Try.

787
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:42,770
Try.

788
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:43,490
Do it.

789
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,190
Try for the one time.

790
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:44,890
Try for the one time.

791
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,410
Five alley kicks and the hop kick.

792
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:49,510
I believe.

793
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,390
Playing like he's fucking Hwoarang.

794
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,570
I was gonna say, that wall is so good.

795
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,290
Like if the back is to the- Okay, thank god, we're on arena.

796
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:57,870
Okay.

797
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,410
Fine with me.

798
00:27:59,490 --> 00:27:59,970
Which stage don't you like?

799
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:01,690
Uh, the dojo.

800
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,330
Oh, cause the wall?

801
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,770
Who's that?

802
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:05,190
Who's that?

803
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:05,490
Josie.

804
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,490
Round one.

805
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,710
Oh, I love the costume.

806
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:09,110
Fight.

807
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:09,690
Yeah.

808
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:10,850
That's like beach.

809
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,750
Oh my god.

810
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,470
Beach time, Reyna.

811
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,410
Ho ho!

812
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,690
Oh, nice grab!

813
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,510
They're both meeting in Hawaii.

814
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,670
On the beach.

815
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,650
Oh my god.

816
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,370
She's into that jaguar dick.

817
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,130
Wait, what?

818
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:22,630
For real?

819
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,210
What?

820
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:25,450
What?

821
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,010
Giga agree.

822
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,990
What a little parrot.

823
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:28,610
It's okay.

824
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,210
What?

825
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,430
What?

826
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:30,490
What?

827
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:30,670
What?

828
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:33,650
Oh my god.

829
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:34,050
Nice.

830
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,670
Wow, that anything.

831
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,530
Oh, nice.

832
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,290
You're beautiful, handsome, beautiful.

833
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,250
Beautiful.

834
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,350
Beautiful a third time.

835
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:39,650
I see a wall.

836
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,250
I see a wall.

837
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,270
Take you to the wall.

838
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,510
Allocake to the wall!

839
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,690
We go to the wall?

840
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,990
I see a wall.

841
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:45,990
What's wrong, bro?

842
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,550
Nice!

843
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:47,830
Oh, the Allocake!

844
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:53,030
Okay, so, he's sidestepping every time to stop the first thing.

845
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,150
Oh, pay attention.

846
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,190
You weren't paying attention coach?

847
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,150
I've- Okay.

848
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:00,670
I'm just going to do this for him.

849
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,970
Sorry, there's a lot of people in the chat.

850
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,390
Oh wow, chat over team, I understand.

851
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,910
I see, I see.

852
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:08,750
Yeah.

853
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:10,770
Alright, fine.

854
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,190
I don't know when to get out there, or how to get out in the next spot.

855
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,690
Don't pull dick jabs in your diet.

856
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:22,210
Yeah.

857
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,170
We'll be good.

858
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,810
Yeah, that's always gonna be a mid.

859
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,070
That's always gonna be a mid when he crashes.

860
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,030
Every fucking time, and I'm trying to just grab to track it, but...

861
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,450
Oh, this guy is buying up.

862
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:33,370
Oh.

863
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,230
Oh my god.

864
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:35,950
Oh my god.

865
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,230
Oh nice, nice, you got out!

866
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,350
Does he know how to get up?

867
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,190
He's ducking.

868
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:39,550
He does not.

869
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:41,910
Nice.

870
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:42,550
Yeah, he's ducking.

871
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,250
We're gonna teach you that dope deep.

872
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,230
That's a free follow-up.

873
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,010
Guaranteed damage.

874
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,130
Oh, nice.

875
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,170
My seventh move.

876
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:48,990
He's gonna sidestep.

877
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,990
Yeah, your seventh move is a guaranteed move.

878
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,230
Fight.

879
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,510
What a hot cake.

880
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,230
I mean, you just read people like that.

881
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,050
It's just as simple as that.

882
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,530
Oh, nice.

883
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,670
Oh my god.

884
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,790
I mean, talk about improvement.

885
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:07,210
What?

886
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:07,470
No.

887
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,230
That's funny as hell.

888
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,770
Lab the matchup.

889
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,150
Reapply.

890
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:12,530
Boom.

891
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:12,830
Dead.

892
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,930
That easy.

893
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,670
I'm gonna be just like that tomorrow.

894
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,430
Yeah, me too.

895
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,310
He's just blocking mids.

896
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,890
He beat me yesterday just by midding.

897
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,570
If I just, like, beat that.

898
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:25,030
He might just start with sidestep again, just autopilot.

899
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,490
I'm gonna see.

900
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:25,690
He does.

901
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,390
He like his 4-4-2 into the high.

902
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,050
You can duck him.

903
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,790
He's like, oh, I'm gonna go for the second hit of the...

904
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:32,830
Damn.

905
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:33,470
Oh my god.

906
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,430
Oh, nice.

907
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,730
Oh my god.

908
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,210
The shoulder.

909
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,170
Oh, we ran the drill.

910
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,750
We ran the shoulder drill.

911
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,350
Thinker back to that wall.

912
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,710
Oh my god.

913
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:42,170
No.

914
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,450
That's all you need.

915
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,590
Beautiful person I've ever met in my life.

916
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,270
Oh my god.

917
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:45,750
That was perfect.

918
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,350
That's good.

919
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,190
You can't have too many.

920
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,910
But sometimes it's a treat.

921
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,530
He's so good.

922
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,290
Point dispenser.

923
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,990
You're in his mind.

924
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,030
Nice.

925
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,210
That's all right.

926
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:06,390
Yeah.

927
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:06,730
Okay.

928
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,730
We're setting up for grab a long time.

929
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,410
Just waiting for you to stand.

930
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:13,930
Oh.

931
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,350
Nice.

932
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,150
No.

933
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,310
Okay.

934
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:18,850
Whatever.

935
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:19,350
Wait.

936
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:19,630
Wall?

937
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:20,950
Never mind.

938
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,130
He might block alley kick here.

939
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:22,750
No.

940
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,090
Oh, nice.

941
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,990
The alley kick.

942
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:26,410
Hey, hey.

943
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,590
Don't listen to me, man.

944
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,030
I'm just kidding.

945
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:31,570
I'm just kidding.

946
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,130
I didn't listen to...

947
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,370
I got my five alley kicks.

948
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,010
I don't know how.

949
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,090
He was blocking it.

950
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:36,610
Oh my god.

951
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,190
The shoulder.

952
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,970
And you just set up another knee.

953
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:39,730
Look at that.

954
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,310
That one is so broken.

955
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,630
I'm running the fuck over.

956
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:41,690
Okay.

957
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,590
They're not going to get hit by this in two days.

958
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,670
That's too obvious.

959
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,230
Oh my god.

960
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,250
Knee, shoulder guarantee me again.

961
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:47,750
I blocked it.

962
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,890
The game is over.

963
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,770
This should have happened two days ago.

964
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,570
Wrap it up.

965
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:51,870
The game is...

966
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,150
The game is...

967
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:52,970
The game is...

968
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:53,190
The game is...

969
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:53,450
The game is...

970
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:53,830
The game is...

971
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,070
This should have happened two days ago.

972
00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:00,710
So these points add on to the points from two days ago.

973
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:04,230
So this is making the gap wider between our team and this team.

974
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,530
They're the second?

975
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,710
They're worth five points instead of three.

976
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:08,690
Yeah.

977
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,190
Oh, nice.

978
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:09,550
Okay.

979
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,170
All right.

980
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,810
Which team's the second team?

981
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:19,310
Well, Tony's and MYK's teams, I think they were tied for a second.

982
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:19,670
Oh.

983
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,730
So it was very close.

984
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:22,930
Nice.

985
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:26,350
Yeah, it's Tony's and MYK's team that are the scariest.

986
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,570
Who is this guy?

987
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,650
Who is this guy?

988
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,270
The Dragoon671.

989
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,370
Is this not private?

990
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,290
What the fuck?

991
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,470
How did this person get in here again?

992
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,910
He was in the last one too.

993
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,130
Yeah.

994
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:42,670
Yeah.

995
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,390
How did this person get in?

996
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,970
Can we not ban him or kick him?

997
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,450
I think it's Kaiser.

998
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,070
All right.

999
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:50,330
There you go.

1000
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:50,670
You kick.

1001
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,290
There we go.

1002
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:52,850
Oh, there you go.

1003
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:54,950
How the fuck does he keep getting in?

1004
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,230
I don't know how he's getting in.

1005
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:57,610
Yeah.

1006
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,950
He probably works for Namco or something.

1007
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,270
The eternal gooner.

1008
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,190
Oh, I gotta get out.

1009
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:02,810
Okay.

1010
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,910
Bro, he's hacking the system.

1011
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,610
All right.

1012
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:11,090
Slime, remember that he does a little two-hit dance thing.

1013
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,450
He likes to go low after that.

1014
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,990
So while sending four, if you block it.

1015
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:14,550
Okay.

1016
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,870
All right.

1017
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,890
And we finished our combos and...

1018
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,910
I mean, didn't you beat him?

1019
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:20,230
Didn't you?

1020
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,910
I beat him last time, but it was...

1021
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:22,250
It was close.

1022
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:22,930
It was clown world.

1023
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:23,950
Yeah.

1024
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:24,870
Yeah, it was.

1025
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,250
It was.

1026
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,770
I remember it.

1027
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:31,750
And yeah, he falls for the bear electric a lot when you just keep repeating it.

1028
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,950
So I don't know if he still will.

1029
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,410
So ready.

1030
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:40,990
Okay.

1031
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,310
Got this, man.

1032
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,630
Get ready for the next battle.

1033
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,410
Let's go.

1034
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,750
I almost wore that same thing today.

1035
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,290
What he's wearing now.

1036
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,170
That should look like a pop tart.

1037
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:02,950
Oh my God.

1038
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,590
That's what I'm talking about.

1039
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,410
That's what I'm talking about.

1040
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:10,610
Oh, I'm definitely behind you guys.

1041
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,530
Okay.

1042
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:13,430
Nice.

1043
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,050
He'll be afraid of that for sure.

1044
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,310
Round two.

1045
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:25,790
Fight.

1046
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:27,390
Talk.

1047
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:28,610
Talk.

1048
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,050
Yeah.

1049
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,570
I didn't mean to do that.

1050
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:32,690
You're going to be the boss.

1051
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:33,310
That's not what I meant.

1052
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:34,390
He's a good player.

1053
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:34,450
You got it.

1054
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:35,350
You got it.

1055
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,210
You got it.

1056
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,480
I got it.

1057
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:41,500
Nice.

1058
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,400
You got it.

1059
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:44,560
You got it.

1060
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,300
Oh, that's good.

1061
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:45,800
Nice.

1062
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,960
Damn it.

1063
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,580
You had a run.

1064
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,780
You had to keep that in mind.

1065
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,260
Okay.

1066
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:57,350
Oops.

1067
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,230
Round three.

1068
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:00,830
Fight.

1069
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,830
Alright, I gotta borrow that panic here.

1070
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:09,650
Big.

1071
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,310
Oh!

1072
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:15,430
Oh!

1073
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,530
Oh, nice!

1074
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,730
Beautiful combo, really.

1075
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:18,850
He's stuck!

1076
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,010
Oh!

1077
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,070
Let him out!

1078
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:22,930
Come on, man!

1079
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,250
Let him out, dude!

1080
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,430
He's just in the fucking corner!

1081
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,310
Put him in the corner!

1082
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,450
Don't let him breathe!

1083
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,430
Nice!

1084
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:41,980
Nice!

1085
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,520
What the fuck is this gameplay?

1086
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,380
I've never seen that large move.

1087
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,020
He called upon Zeus.

1088
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,600
It's like a mini-jack.

1089
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,620
Nice!

1090
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,060
Punish!

1091
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,880
That's what I'm talking about, Fly!

1092
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,420
Good shit!

1093
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,320
Fuck yeah, the shit we talked about!

1094
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,040
One more round, brother.

1095
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,180
Oh my god, I'm so bad.

1096
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,640
I'm so behind.

1097
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,020
We should start with a little hop.

1098
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,260
Oh my goodness.

1099
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,940
We're getting real cute now.

1100
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,240
That's all good.

1101
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,720
Oh, wow!

1102
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,120
That's fucking crazy!

1103
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:19,700
Oh, what?

1104
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,320
No way!

1105
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,020
Dude!

1106
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,480
That's unreal, dude.

1107
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,660
Wait, did you guys... did he win?

1108
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,040
Mental shatter.

1109
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,640
He won!

1110
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,260
Oh my god, I'm still watching him beat him up!

1111
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,180
That's just a reverse three-up.

1112
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,080
Bro, like a model in this opulent mansion.

1113
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,740
Oh, man.

1114
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,360
Good shit, man.

1115
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:39,720
Wow.

1116
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,220
Good reverse.

1117
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:45,840
Fight!

1118
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:52,510
Nice.

1119
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:53,950
Oh.

1120
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,030
That's cool.

1121
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,730
Alright, you're still ahead.

1122
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,410
He whips.

1123
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,250
Shit, that's good shit.

1124
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,010
I top-kick.

1125
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,350
I tried.

1126
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:08,630
Oh, nice.

1127
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,410
What the fuck is that?

1128
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,030
Is that unblockable?

1129
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,490
Yeah, that's an unblockable.

1130
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,910
You can twin-paste on him before he gets to you.

1131
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,600
Watch your way, Gart.

1132
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1133
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,860
Oh, nice!

1134
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,460
He missed!

1135
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:25,940
He has!

1136
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,520
Very nice.

1137
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,400
Very nice.

1138
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,560
Oh, okay.

1139
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,220
Oh, he's lovely.

1140
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,460
By his large dress, like Mr. Beast chocolate.

1141
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,160
He's pretty tall.

1142
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,320
He is.

1143
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,800
Beast knife.

1144
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,140
Beastables.

1145
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,280
Beastables.

1146
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,900
Bro, look at Mighty Beastable right now, bro.

1147
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,600
Oh my god.

1148
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,720
Mr. Beast sponsored us.

1149
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,140
Okay, I don't know.

1150
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:47,940
He was just doing...

1151
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,000
He did neutral air.

1152
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,080
I don't know what that is.

1153
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,460
Yeah, right.

1154
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,800
It's Samus Nair.

1155
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,460
I keep left here.

1156
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:52,960
Easy.

1157
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,320
Beautiful.

1158
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,180
Nice.

1159
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,600
It's a combo, but it's okay.

1160
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,120
Drop your American reset.

1161
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,200
That's what we call that slime.

1162
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:00,700
American reset.

1163
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,720
An actual American reset.

1164
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,560
You guys low here?

1165
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,020
He knew.

1166
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,000
You have heat?

1167
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,460
It predicted.

1168
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:09,780
He knew.

1169
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,090
Oh, nice.

1170
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,670
Nice flip.

1171
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,710
Let's go.

1172
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:21,350
Nice.

1173
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,250
Oh my god.

1174
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:22,910
That's slime.

1175
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,910
One more, brother.

1176
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,890
This guy learned how to mix and hunting bear stance.

1177
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,270
It's over.

1178
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:28,650
That's...

1179
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,830
Oh, that would have been a twin piston right there.

1180
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,090
We dropped?

1181
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:39,870
Pathetic.

1182
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,490
It's a pathetic turn.

1183
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,110
Yeah.

1184
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:46,810
He plays pathetically.

1185
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,590
I Jesus.

1186
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,910
Big agree, slime.

1187
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,410
Stop using heat, you pussy.

1188
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,110
Bug it.

1189
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:01,450
Nice.

1190
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:02,930
He's a talker.

1191
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,110
Okay.

1192
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:04,870
Okay.

1193
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:05,390
Okay.

1194
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,170
Okay.

1195
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:06,530
Okay.

1196
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:06,750
Okay.

1197
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:07,010
Okay.

1198
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,470
Okay.

1199
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:08,990
Okay.

1200
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,470
Okay.

1201
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:12,730
Okay.

1202
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:15,730
Okay.

1203
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:15,850
I'm going to go.

1204
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,570
You got this cool side wall last time too.

1205
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,430
I think it was against him.

1206
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,770
That's an actual...

1207
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,050
He fell into the bear enclosure.

1208
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,210
It just got pushed.

1209
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:28,890
And they were like...

1210
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:31,370
His family was like, oh, someone please.

1211
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,570
Bro, he couldn't get out.

1212
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,410
He loved Mr. Beast.

1213
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,090
Oh my god.

1214
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:40,850
That was so stressful.

1215
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,090
Good shit, dude.

1216
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,590
When he won rounds, he fucking won rounds too.

1217
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:45,330
It was really scary.

1218
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:45,590
Yeah.

1219
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:45,710
Yeah.

1220
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,950
Lars is just kind of steamrolly.

1221
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:47,430
He'll do that.

1222
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,570
He just runs you over.

1223
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:49,390
Good shit.

1224
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,350
I didn't use back...

1225
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,450
Yeah, you downloaded him.

1226
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,090
Dude, slime.

1227
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:54,210
Everything we talked about, bro.

1228
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,010
You are doing that shit with purpose.

1229
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:56,170
I applied it.

1230
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,370
I know.

1231
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,710
It makes me so happy.

1232
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,610
I'm going to keep it 100 dot.

1233
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:04,530
I know we're having fun, but you're a really fucking good coach.

1234
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,610
I'm serious.

1235
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:06,090
Yeah.

1236
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,290
Even beyond the meme shit.

1237
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:08,930
Seriously.

1238
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:09,270
I'm blazing.

1239
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,090
The shit you sent me last night was sick.

1240
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:11,490
Thank you.

1241
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,150
Yeah, you managed to teach me a fifth move.

1242
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,210
That's fucking insane.

1243
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:15,690
I'm going to go.

1244
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,350
Yeah, we're cooking.

1245
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,470
Oh, yeah, dude.

1246
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,750
Get his ass, Matt.

1247
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,110
Let's get it.

1248
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,110
Jack Jesus.

1249
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,210
Real shit.

1250
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:25,530
No.

1251
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,570
Yakushima is a breath of fresh air for Shifter right now.

1252
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,870
I did not want that.

1253
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,090
Oh, this is Shifter rage quit last time.

1254
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:35,350
Okay.

1255
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:35,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1256
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:36,510
It's the wrong map for him.

1257
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,250
In the mansion.

1258
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,030
I think he's learning now.

1259
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,530
How do you even do jack practice?

1260
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,170
You got to call up Anakin.

1261
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,270
Yeah.

1262
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:45,670
I'm going to go.

1263
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,090
Red Bull Anakin.

1264
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:49,610
Red Bull Anakin for $100 an hour.

1265
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,390
This is fucking crazy, dude.

1266
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,730
Oh, my God.

1267
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:54,770
Matisse, stop.

1268
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:58,350
Don't make him a plank in the beginning of the round.

1269
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,510
Oh, no.

1270
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,350
Bro doesn't know where he's shooting.

1271
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:04,730
Yeah.

1272
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,570
Is there a duck here?

1273
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,170
Fight.

1274
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,930
Oh, he's tilted.

1275
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,790
You can tell.

1276
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,150
Yeah.

1277
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:13,790
I think so.

1278
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,270
I would be pissed if I had to play again.

1279
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:15,670
I'm going to go.

1280
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:16,450
I'd be furious, dude.

1281
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:17,190
Madman's jackade.

1282
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:17,910
Yeah.

1283
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,730
Like, he already won the trip to evil.

1284
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:20,770
Why is he here again?

1285
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,810
That's what I'm saying, man.

1286
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,850
What the fuck is his problem, man?

1287
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,220
Holy shit.

1288
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,600
Round three.

1289
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,140
Fight.

1290
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,340
Oh.

1291
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,020
Oh.

1292
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:36,940
Oh.

1293
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,980
What is that whiff, monkey the animal?

1294
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,100
Range five whiff.

1295
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,240
I don't think he's thinking anymore.

1296
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,160
Not going to lie.

1297
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,140
That's too much.

1298
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:47,880
That's too much damage, dude.

1299
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,000
No, fuck.

1300
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,540
He's a big boy.

1301
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,240
I'm done.

1302
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,820
I'm rooting for shifter now.

1303
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,900
Holy shit.

1304
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,600
Just to balance things out.

1305
00:41:59,700 --> 00:41:59,920
Okay.

1306
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,900
He gets a round.

1307
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,900
I got auto-balanced to the other team.

1308
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:06,880
Oh, wait.

1309
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,860
Is he going to take a round off?

1310
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,940
He took a round off you.

1311
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,200
Round four.

1312
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:12,580
Fight.

1313
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,260
Oh, my God.

1314
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:13,800
Okay.

1315
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,580
We are blocking.

1316
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,020
Oh, my God.

1317
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:17,120
Oh, my God.

1318
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,480
Oh, okay.

1319
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,500
That is insane.

1320
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,540
Bro, all he can do is block.

1321
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:23,980
He's a force.

1322
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,480
Drop the stab.

1323
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,620
That's a double B.

1324
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,360
Don't even need it.

1325
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:28,800
Don't even...

1326
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,580
Oh, my God.

1327
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,120
It ended fast.

1328
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,860
It doesn't fucking end, man.

1329
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,300
Doki, how are you delayed if you're in the lobby with us?

1330
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,040
I don't know.

1331
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,360
That's so weird.

1332
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,520
Yeah, you're getting spoilered.

1333
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,100
Yeah.

1334
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:46,760
I was screaming.

1335
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,120
I was screaming.

1336
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,160
You're going to have to restart tech.

1337
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,360
I think so.

1338
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:49,700
Yeah.

1339
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,920
You guys were like, end the stab.

1340
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,020
She's still playing.

1341
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,780
She's doing strings.

1342
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,960
Oh, her PC is potato.

1343
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,680
Matt, you know that two hits... the string he did before he did a low heat smash?

1344
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,680
The second hit is a high.

1345
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,480
Oh.

1346
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,280
Fight.

1347
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,140
Oh.

1348
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:16,180
Nice.

1349
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:16,680
Oh, yeah.

1350
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,060
Oh, yeah.

1351
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:17,100
Oh, yeah.

1352
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,820
Yeah.

1353
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,020
Uh -oh.

1354
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:18,580
Big mistake.

1355
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,520
That's in the commandments.

1356
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,160
Every time.

1357
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,800
Time to be punished.

1358
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,260
Half bar.

1359
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:26,740
Oh, my God.

1360
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,320
Don't let her get up.

1361
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,120
Oh, my God.

1362
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,580
What a gamma howl.

1363
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,000
What the fuck is this?

1364
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,560
Actually, it's my turn.

1365
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,780
It's his turn forever.

1366
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,260
My turn.

1367
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:40,720
Launch.

1368
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,560
You can launch it.

1369
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,020
I know.

1370
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,240
I know.

1371
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:42,960
Dude.

1372
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,660
I'm sinking back.

1373
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,920
Why does he have a look that's just like, nope, reverse.

1374
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:47,100
I'm going to...

1375
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,200
Of course!

1376
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,440
Ah, I like the idea.

1377
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:55,260
Oh.

1378
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,860
Classic Zettel.

1379
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,360
They were killing slime with that.

1380
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,620
Did he know?

1381
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,240
He doesn't know!

1382
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,660
No way.

1383
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:12,800
Bounce?

1384
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,160
It's a guard break!

1385
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,040
You can't block it!

1386
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,080
You've gotta be fucking joking!

1387
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:19,980
I... dude.

1388
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:20,820
Okay.

1389
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,900
It'll be a miracle if Shifter makes it to Sunday.

1390
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,120
I would destroy my PC.

1391
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:25,880
This is insane.

1392
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,640
What if, like, we get the buy?

1393
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,900
Where is his bar?!

1394
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,560
Bro, we looked away for five seconds and the Skelp is gone!

1395
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,420
Two seconds.

1396
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,000
Oh my god, two seconds?!

1397
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,880
This is fucking unfair.

1398
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,400
This character is insane.

1399
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,880
Lud, where are you?

1400
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:48,580
Easy.

1401
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,940
Lud, where are you?

1402
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,140
Oh my god, dude.

1403
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,360
I think we ruined his day.

1404
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,040
He has like four more rounds to go.

1405
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,060
Yeah, that's a joke.

1406
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,780
Yeah, that's a hard jam.

1407
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,560
How will he face the other four opponents?

1408
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:02,780
How will he face the other four opponents?

1409
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:03,920
Uhhh...

1410
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,800
You know what, BrawlPro?

1411
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,100
That's a 4-0 sweep.

1412
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,300
So you win.

1413
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,120
Yeah, yeah, keep it going.

1414
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,920
Yeah, but surely you'll win.

1415
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,920
You're king players.

1416
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,680
You wouldn't let us down, right, coach?

1417
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,400
I'm laughing for all you guys yesterday.

1418
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,180
I don't have time.

1419
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,300
I'm not gonna let you down, right, coach?

1420
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,540
I laughed for four people in one day.

1421
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,300
When am I gonna laugh for myself?

1422
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,480
Four people that you laughed for me?

1423
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,360
Okay, but we played though.

1424
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,040
You sent me on my way.

1425
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:31,560
You said...

1426
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,720
I literally DM'd you.

1427
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,480
I said, hey, I'm having trouble with this.

1428
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,640
You're like, go check the VOD.

1429
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:36,680
And then you left me alone.

1430
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,160
Oh, come out!

1431
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,200
I was with slime when you sent that.

1432
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,780
Four people my ass, bro.

1433
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,300
Okay, three people.

1434
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,440
You literally sent me on my way.

1435
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,340
You're like, nah, Matt's good.

1436
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:50,960
Here's $20.

1437
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,700
Order a pizza.

1438
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,520
You're old enough to take care of yourself.

1439
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,160
That's what I'm saying.

1440
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,320
That's how he treats my ass.

1441
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,340
Hot dogs in the sink.

1442
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,200
This fucking guy, man.

1443
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,460
He just thinks I can do it all.

1444
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,120
Matt, you called me broke yesterday.

1445
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,040
It's just payback.

1446
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,160
Oh my goodness.

1447
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,780
Now the chat spam is broke pro.

1448
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:08,820
Like, what is that?

1449
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:14,780
Okay.

1450
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:22,510
Ooh.

1451
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:24,650
I love that move.

1452
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:25,110
Oh.

1453
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:26,790
Boom.

1454
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:28,230
Nice.

1455
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:30,450
Do the alley kicks.

1456
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:31,650
That's guaranteed.

1457
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:32,810
Yes.

1458
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:35,950
Yeah!

1459
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,040
Round two.

1460
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:43,980
Oh, okay.

1461
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:44,200
I see.

1462
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:44,680
Fight.

1463
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,640
Damn, wah.

1464
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,840
It's not a good look if you're the only one that doesn't win a round, bro.

1465
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,880
Not a good look.

1466
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:00,640
High as a hot...

1467
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,440
The coach doesn't win for us?

1468
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,620
After all the points we got for him?

1469
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,100
He's late and he loses?

1470
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,280
And he loses?

1471
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:10,760
Wait.

1472
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,060
Wait, unless...

1473
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,060
Ooh.

1474
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,100
Ooh.

1475
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,640
That's not what I'm talking about.

1476
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:21,900
Oh.

1477
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:22,620
Oh.

1478
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,400
That guy just knows.

1479
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,780
Looking like slime out there.

1480
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,420
I feel like the more we roast him, the better he does, guys.

1481
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,100
No.

1482
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,120
I don't think that.

1483
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,560
He needs to prove us wrong.

1484
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,440
He needs to prove us wrong.

1485
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,060
He needs to prove us wrong.

1486
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,480
The nothing?

1487
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,700
Damn, he's agile.

1488
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:50,720
Dude, the higher level Tekken gets, the more people just run up and do nothing.

1489
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:51,420
It's so scary.

1490
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,480
You're just like, what is he gonna do?

1491
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:54,760
Pop, pop.

1492
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,560
And it's game.

1493
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,180
Alright, alright, alright.

1494
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,000
My fault, coach.

1495
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,880
My fault, coach.

1496
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:03,520
I'm so bad at the game.

1497
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,040
It's okay.

1498
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:04,060
It's okay.

1499
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:08,700
Rage art?

1500
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,240
We win.

1501
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:12,800
Let's go!

1502
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,620
Don't worry, I'm gonna see the rage art soon.

1503
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,620
I'm gonna armor this black ass Mixle.

1504
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,500
Guys, don't worry.

1505
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,140
He's rage arting.

1506
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,660
He's rage arting now.

1507
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,280
Final flight, baby.

1508
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,240
Guys, he was definitely starting to feel himself.

1509
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,740
He was like, ooh, watch this straight.

1510
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,560
And then you just wait, wait.

1511
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:35,980
That's nice.

1512
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:37,620
Nice job.

1513
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,100
I got him so behind.

1514
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,640
Good shit.

1515
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,340
One more, bro.

1516
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,320
It's okay.

1517
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,280
I'll do my best, boys.

1518
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,280
I saw the rage art just then, guys.

1519
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:48,940
Round one.

1520
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:49,600
Nice.

1521
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,600
Fight.

1522
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:51,880
Boom.

1523
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,360
Good shit.

1524
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:54,740
The coach doesn't know.

1525
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,680
This is it.

1526
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,560
Uh-oh.

1527
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,060
No!

1528
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,380
What a fucking giant swing, bro.

1529
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:09,900
What?

1530
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,480
Oh my god.

1531
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,720
Yes!

1532
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,740
He teabagged.

1533
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,680
That's our coach.

1534
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,740
That's the values he teaches us.

1535
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,000
He teabagged from my coach.

1536
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,080
He told me to do it after every game.

1537
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,600
Please stop.

1538
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,660
Slime, you've seen Billy Madison, right?

1539
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,460
Yeah, yeah.

1540
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,920
We're the O'Doyles.

1541
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,080
That's this team.

1542
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,860
We're just the fucking O'Doyles.

1543
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:46,500
This doesn't bode well if we get to the very end of the movie.

1544
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,260
Let's avoid buses.

1545
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,260
Wait, what happens at the end of the movie?

1546
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,360
What happens?

1547
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,640
Don't worry about it.

1548
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,520
Is it a good thing?

1549
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,400
O'Doyle rules.

1550
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,020
Oh my god, alpha air.

1551
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:58,900
Whoa, coach.

1552
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,420
Okay, no problem.

1553
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,560
Oh, you got cocky there.

1554
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,780
Anti-air anime fighter.

1555
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,180
Okay, tango.

1556
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,220
What the fuck?

1557
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:17,940
You just kicked her.

1558
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,600
Yeah, it's a low grab.

1559
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,020
You gotta hold down back to attack it.

1560
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,600
Oh my god.

1561
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,080
No problem, no problem here.

1562
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,960
I just wanted to make it close for content.

1563
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:27,500
That's it.

1564
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,200
Nice.

1565
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,540
Oh, good.

1566
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,660
Boom, boom, bop.

1567
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,160
Nice.

1568
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,100
Alley kick.

1569
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:38,960
Imagine.

1570
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:39,960
Ooh.

1571
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:41,980
Oh.

1572
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:42,780
Nice.

1573
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,100
Guess we're game.

1574
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,160
Oh, what?

1575
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,640
How come we weren't taught that move?

1576
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,000
It's too dangerous.

1577
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:55,580
It's too dangerous.

1578
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,680
We would kill ourselves doing it.

1579
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,120
Break our neck.

1580
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,600
His final technique.

1581
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,200
Only when you're a god you can do this.

1582
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:14,410
Damn it.

1583
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:16,630
That was a good grab.

1584
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:17,650
Oh.

1585
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:20,830
Okay, I see.

1586
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:23,590
I see, I see.

1587
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,090
One more set.

1588
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:25,850
Come on, coach.

1589
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:26,770
You got this.

1590
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,510
O'Doyle is being the matrix.

1591
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:29,710
Bless what?

1592
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:31,390
Downloading.

1593
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:32,610
Perfecto para ti.

1594
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:35,130
Let's go.

1595
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,030
Let's go.

1596
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:39,330
Let's go.

1597
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:39,610
One.

1598
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:41,130
Fight.

1599
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:46,550
One day we'll all be a hundred Daniels.

1600
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:48,810
Where did that come from?

1601
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,930
I'm only 30 Daniels.

1602
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,670
Naughty, I think I'm 20 Daniels.

1603
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:54,210
How do you get a hundred Daniels?

1604
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:56,670
They just give you 70 Daniels after you get...

1605
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,470
Oh, you get to 30 and they just...

1606
00:51:58,510 --> 00:51:58,730
Yeah.

1607
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,430
There's just too many Daniels in the world.

1608
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,150
You gotta adopt them.

1609
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:04,530
Adopt, don't shop.

1610
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:08,330
Oh, get up.

1611
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:09,910
Get up, coach.

1612
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:10,650
Come on, coach.

1613
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,110
Get up, they're beating your ass.

1614
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:13,850
Adrian.

1615
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:16,510
Come on.

1616
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:20,710
Oh.

1617
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:22,890
Oh, nice.

1618
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:25,510
What the fuck is that?

1619
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:26,250
Oh, dude.

1620
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:32,930
Oh, yes, sir.

1621
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:33,390
Oh.

1622
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:34,190
Nice.

1623
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:37,630
She's screaming the whole time.

1624
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:38,710
Stop.

1625
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:41,050
I hate this.

1626
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:41,710
Oh, no.

1627
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:42,270
Oh, nice.

1628
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:48,390
Oh, no.

1629
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:49,470
She took you to the wall.

1630
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:53,330
Damn it.

1631
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:55,470
No problem.

1632
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:55,830
No problem.

1633
00:52:56,970 --> 00:52:57,530
It's okay.

1634
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:58,190
You bring it back.

1635
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,270
Smash a beer bottle.

1636
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:04,730
What a good block.

1637
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:12,430
The punish.

1638
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,130
Kaiser might be gaming.

1639
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:17,510
Ooh.

1640
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:23,250
You know, we're just giving them false sense of scaredy.

1641
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:24,130
Yes.

1642
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,190
Nice.

1643
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:26,210
Nice.

1644
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:26,530
Nice.

1645
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:27,510
Okay.

1646
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:31,790
Oh, we love holding back here.

1647
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:32,250
Yes.

1648
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:32,650
Yeah.

1649
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,510
We don't hit any buttons.

1650
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:35,510
No.

1651
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:37,350
No buttons.

1652
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:38,990
Fight.

1653
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:43,580
Oh, my God.

1654
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:44,040
Oh.

1655
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,420
Nice dick punch.

1656
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:51,010
Oh.

1657
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:53,690
I didn't know what the second hit was.

1658
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:58,290
Oh.

1659
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:00,570
Yeah.

1660
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,090
That might be it.

1661
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:07,590
Oh, yeah.

1662
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:08,650
Damn.

1663
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:09,050
GG.

1664
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,130
Oh, GG.

1665
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:11,850
Nice try.

1666
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:12,150
Nice try.

1667
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,270
It's okay.

1668
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:16,310
We just wanted to give them one extra point.

1669
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:17,450
You know, we felt bad.

1670
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:17,810
Yeah.

1671
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:18,350
Makes sense.

1672
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:22,390
You gave us all a shard of yourself, BrawlPro.

1673
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:22,850
Yeah.

1674
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:24,190
Yeah.

1675
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,950
Across the team because it's just mathematically better, you know?

1676
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:29,590
Yeah.

1677
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,590
We add all of us together as one BrawlPro.

1678
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,110
I'm okay getting carried by my team.

1679
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:35,050
I'm okay with that.

1680
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:41,830
Bro, it's like the Ninja Turtles getting care- like Splinter, like taking care of those babies and now he's the old Splinter.

1681
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,730
And we're the Ninja Turtles.

1682
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:45,630
I'm Raphael though.

1683
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:46,470
I won't be Raphael.

1684
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:47,550
That's fine.

1685
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,670
I just- Leonardo, I'll call it.

1686
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:50,850
You guys can have the other two.

1687
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:52,870
Sorry.

1688
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:56,150
Sorry that there's- Doki, do you know the Ninja Turtles?

1689
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:56,430
Yeah!

1690
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:57,510
I'm Donatello!

1691
00:54:58,090 --> 00:54:59,030
Okay, there we go.

1692
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:01,310
That means that's the party, dude!

1693
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:02,450
I don't give a shit.

1694
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:04,710
Does it work out any better than that?

1695
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:06,570
Does it work out any better?

1696
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:07,370
It's perfect.

1697
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:08,090
Perfect.

1698
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:13,530
I actually liked Donatello when I was a kid because I thought he was the smartest.

1699
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:14,590
And I thought that was important.

1700
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,890
Yeah, that's why I'm Donatello.

1701
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:17,990
But not now?

1702
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:21,570
No, now I just- I want to be like the Chad Leonardo with swords.

1703
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:22,570
Well, sure.

1704
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,790
Wait, then Matt- Yeah, then Matt is Mikey.

1705
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:26,850
Michelangelo.

1706
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:28,250
That just makes sense.

1707
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:28,750
That makes sense!

1708
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:32,070
Literally, I couldn't ask for a better turtle.

1709
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:35,890
Because I know- I know he can never be Donatello.

1710
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:42,990
Alright, we got a stack before the next round, so if you guys want to run A- Oh, nice.

1711
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:43,710
We can chill.

1712
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:45,590
Yeah, I got to do a quick match.

1713
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:50,050
I'm feeling kind of- Yeah, I'm going to restart my tech in because I'm 80 fucking seconds behind.

1714
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:53,670
because I'm 80 fucking seconds behind.

1715
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:56,070
You just hooked up your new computer and now you're still on Potato Island.

1716
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:56,510
Hey, look.

1717
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:57,230
In the finals.

1718
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:59,770
Look, it's because- it's like those training weights.

1719
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:02,850
So when the weights are finally off for the finals, I'm unstoppable.

1720
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:04,170
Yeah, right?

1721
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:04,650
Yeah.

1722
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:05,830
That's how it goes.

1723
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:08,490
It's like not 20 FPS, you're like, Oh my god, you see the matrix.

1724
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,810
I see an 800 frames.

1725
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:12,810
That'll be good.

1726
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:16,760
Who's next?

1727
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:19,560
I don't know.

1728
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,260
Who do we play?

1729
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,440
We play...

1730
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,220
against...

1731
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,800
Let's look at our team brawl pro chat.

1732
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,640
Broke's Godot!

1733
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,300
Or Godot!

1734
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,280
That's awesome!

1735
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:32,980
Godot?

1736
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,840
I'm fighting an ace attorney.

1737
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:37,380
Dragunov.

1738
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,540
He has like the mask and everything.

1739
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,220
We're fighting Tone next.

1740
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,260
Alright.

1741
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,820
That's BoxBox.

1742
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,180
He can beat me 100%.

1743
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,360
I played him a lot last night.

1744
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:51,640
I played him a lot last night.

1745
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:56,500
Yeah?

1746
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,140
How does he feel?

1747
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,440
He's getting better.

1748
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:00,580
For sure.

1749
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:17,350
Guys, I swear.

1750
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:20,990
For the finals, the PC will be plugged in.

1751
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:22,490
I swear.

1752
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:27,350
I swear.

1753
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,710
For real this time.

1754
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:31,710
For real chat!

1755
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:34,370
I would never lie to you!

1756
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:36,090
Are you watching the mainstream?

1757
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:37,810
I'm just on a...

1758
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:38,810
Quick matching.

1759
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:39,910
I feel rest.

1760
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:40,950
I swear!

1761
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:43,810
It's gonna be there!

1762
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:50,030
But I'm gonna have it set up before the finals.

1763
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:53,790
So by the time the finals roll up, I'm gonna be a god.

1764
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:54,610
That king.

1765
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:01,690
That doesn't mean she'll use it.

1766
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:03,710
It's unboxed!

1767
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:05,910
The first step is over.

1768
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,730
I completed the first step!

1769
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:11,330
Is that what matters?

1770
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:14,570
Yeah.

1771
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,310
I completed the first step!

1772
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:23,310
I completed the first step!

1773
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:23,690
I completed the first step!

1774
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,150
I completed the first step!

1775
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:29,890
This guy's pretty good, but his offense is kinda weak.

1776
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:30,130
Don't worry.

1777
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:31,950
The frames will be back soon, guys.

1778
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:33,850
It'll be back soon!

1779
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:35,570
Don't worry!

1780
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:39,330
I'm loading in...

1781
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:40,250
See, there you go!

1782
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,910
I was loading in the shaders!

1783
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,830
I was loading in...

1784
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:45,510
I'm loading in more shaders!

1785
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:48,830
He ducked that one time, but not other times.

1786
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:50,430
I don't expect people to mix up.

1787
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:53,690
The shaders are loading up, guys!

1788
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:57,510
There we go!

1789
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:58,670
It's fine now, see?

1790
00:58:58,890 --> 00:58:59,690
Now it's fine!

1791
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:00,810
Now you can see everything!

1792
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:03,370
Now you can see everything!

1793
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:05,710
There!

1794
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:06,730
It's fine.

1795
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:10,630
If he just waits and then does that...

1796
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:14,610
See, look!

1797
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:15,270
It's smooth!

1798
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:17,050
It's so smooth, chat!

1799
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:19,530
But this is my favorite move now.

1800
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:20,730
This is honestly...

1801
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:23,610
I haven't done that yet.

1802
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:25,290
I think it hits wall here?

1803
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:27,170
This cat let go.

1804
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:28,850
This is my favorite move, chat.

1805
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:33,590
And then this.

1806
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:37,870
And then I can do the hop kick.

1807
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:41,890
The perfect move!

1808
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:45,050
It's how I got to this elo.

1809
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:54,200
The best move ever.

1810
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,160
Nobody can fucking counter it for some reason.

1811
00:59:59,300 --> 00:59:59,960
I don't know why.

1812
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,100
Wait, this guy has...

1813
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,180
This guy is on wifi.

1814
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,180
Look, this guy's wifi.

1815
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,440
He deserves to have the frames.

1816
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:11,000
He deserves the treatment.

1817
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:13,040
I'm putting him through with my APC.

1818
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:16,540
No, please.

1819
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,020
I'm sorry.

1820
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:17,980
I did not mean that.

1821
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:18,960
Please, I'm so sorry.

1822
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:19,480
I was joking.

1823
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:21,600
I did not mean that.

1824
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,020
Alright.

1825
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,140
Oh my god!

1826
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,840
Goodbye, he broke my arm.

1827
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,760
No, see the frames are okay now!

1828
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:33,580
It's okay!

1829
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,580
See, look!

1830
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,780
Everything is fine!

1831
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,760
You guys can see everything!

1832
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,420
It just takes a bit to load it in.

1833
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:42,320
Okay, watch this.

1834
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:44,400
And then...

1835
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,540
And then...

1836
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,340
Oh, wait!

1837
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:46,860
What the fuck!

1838
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,400
Sir, sir!

1839
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,140
You were supposed to let me do a hop kick.

1840
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:53,120
That wasn't what the alley kicks are for.

1841
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:54,900
Oh shit.

1842
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,280
Okay.

1843
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,600
Guys, it's not looking so good.

1844
01:00:58,740 --> 01:00:59,220
JK!

1845
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:02,900
He cheated!

1846
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:06,300
He cheated in front of a king player?

1847
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,900
What the fuck is wrong with him?

1848
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,460
What is wrong with this man?

1849
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,860
How dare you!

1850
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,500
Here we go.

1851
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,240
He's not gonna duck again.

1852
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:24,820
He never learned.

1853
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:27,440
They never learn when they play against a king.

1854
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,100
Oh!

1855
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:30,320
It's fine.

1856
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,480
Oh, wait!

1857
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,040
He overheard me!

1858
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,000
Not!

1859
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:36,280
Oh, he's not gonna duck again.

1860
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,320
It's fine.

1861
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,500
This time, it's fine.

1862
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,060
No!

1863
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:41,420
It's not fine!

1864
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,160
I'm so sorry!

1865
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,320
Let me go!

1866
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:44,880
I'm so sorry!

1867
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:45,480
Let me go!

1868
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:53,100
No way.

1869
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:57,040
And then my secret hidden six move that nobody knows yet.

1870
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,320
Until the finals.

1871
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,740
Then people are gonna know in the finals.

1872
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:02,920
That's fucking right.

1873
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,140
No more over... Oh shit!

1874
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:06,480
Oh!

1875
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,000
Okay.

1876
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:08,720
I'm not gonna lie.

1877
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:09,760
Please, please, please.

1878
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:10,640
Give me that.

1879
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:11,440
Please.

1880
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,260
Oh!

1881
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:14,980
Give me that one hit.

1882
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:18,980
Oh.

1883
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,120
Oh, that's scary.

1884
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:21,920
It's fine.

1885
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,100
And then...

1886
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,520
And then it's my turn, right?

1887
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:26,800
Is it my turn?

1888
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,560
It is.

1889
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:28,620
Yay!

1890
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,060
You bitch.

1891
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,120
You whore.

1892
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:33,500
Okay, it's fine.

1893
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:34,860
There we go.

1894
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,180
And again!

1895
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:36,580
Oh!

1896
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:37,120
He's fine!

1897
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:41,840
Nobody loves you!

1898
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,380
Nobody loves you!

1899
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:43,200
Not even your mom!

1900
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:44,660
Okay.

1901
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,560
I'm so sorry.

1902
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:47,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1903
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:47,780
Get closer, please.

1904
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:51,360
No!

1905
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,160
The sides.

1906
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:55,060
There we go.

1907
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:55,280
See?

1908
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:56,200
We did it.

1909
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:56,560
Yay!

1910
01:02:59,200 --> 01:02:59,640
Yay!

1911
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,580
How did I hit?

1912
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,580
Because I called him loveless.

1913
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,360
I called him a loveless child.

1914
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,700
And that's how it hits.

1915
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:12,380
I've become a fighting game... gamer.

1916
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,080
Get ready for the next one!

1917
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,180
That's how it works.

1918
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:34,680
If you tell your enemy nobody loves him, they'll get hurt emotionally and then you win.

1919
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:38,900
The one button rage arts are the win.

1920
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:41,760
Get one and done.

1921
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:42,600
Exactly.

1922
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,300
He's not special.

1923
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,060
He's not the only one and done.

1924
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,600
It's okay, guys.

1925
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:54,520
Guys, don't worry.

1926
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:55,940
I'm loading in the shaders.

1927
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:57,220
It'll be fine.

1928
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:57,620
See?

1929
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,520
I told you.

1930
01:03:58,540 --> 01:03:58,860
It's fine.

1931
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:01,740
I had to load in the shaders there.

1932
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:04,560
Yay!

1933
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:06,960
Oh.

1934
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:09,800
Okay.

1935
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,280
Nice.

1936
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,940
I don't know how that hit too, but...

1937
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,000
I'll take it!

1938
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:15,880
Wait.

1939
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,380
I never expect people to counter that.

1940
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:25,680
We try to say the higher you load, the more easily I can counter.

1941
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,000
Oh, shit.

1942
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:30,260
Okay.

1943
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,700
Oh, oh.

1944
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:33,760
No!

1945
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:34,380
No!

1946
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:35,800
Please!

1947
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,720
I'm sorry.

1948
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,720
I'm so sorry.

1949
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,480
JK, I'm not sorry.

1950
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,020
Oh, he ducked!

1951
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,380
JK, I'm still not sorry.

1952
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,400
I don't learn.

1953
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,400
I don't learn.

1954
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,760
That's fucking...

1955
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,460
Right!

1956
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:01,240
Yeah!

1957
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:04,060
Okay, is he gonna hit?

1958
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:05,020
No, he's not.

1959
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,100
It's fine.

1960
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,180
He fucking ducked that?

1961
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:10,560
How?

1962
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:15,590
Bro!

1963
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:16,830
He just walks away!

1964
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,670
You don't walk away from me!

1965
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:20,910
Oh my god.

1966
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:23,250
How do you just walk away?

1967
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:25,050
How do you lose?

1968
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:26,590
Just turn around and walk away.

1969
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:30,430
Okay.

1970
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:32,090
Oh my god.

1971
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:33,130
Oh my god.

1972
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:37,490
He keeps walking away from me!

1973
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:38,790
I don't know what to do!

1974
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:47,190
Surprised Pikachu face.

1975
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:48,510
He just...

1976
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:50,770
He just walks!

1977
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:52,470
It's insane!

1978
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:53,810
I don't know how he does it.

1979
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:57,610
The spacing.

1980
01:05:57,610 --> 01:05:59,570
Just turn around.

1981
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:01,770
You know?

1982
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:03,370
Just fucking turn around.

1983
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:04,450
Don't duck!

1984
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:05,550
Oh, thank god.

1985
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,270
Don't duck as well.

1986
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:11,470
Oh, nice.

1987
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:13,090
Nice!

1988
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:14,470
No!

1989
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:16,510
I fucked it up, but it's for perfect.

1990
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:25,070
I fucked it up, but it doesn't matter.

1991
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:27,450
Goodbye!

1992
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:30,070
Goodbye!

1993
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:32,970
Yay!

1994
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:34,870
We won that...

1995
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:41,850
The reason why we're not in the game yet, in the next round yet, is that we won the game so fucking fast, that like, uh...

1996
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:46,090
We won our set so fast, that we're just chilling now.

1997
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:47,830
We're just practicing warming up.

1998
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:51,230
Nothing works, AlleyKick!

1999
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:52,170
Exactly!

2000
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:54,750
Exactly!

2001
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:55,770
Oh.

2002
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:56,710
We're just waiting.

2003
01:06:57,090 --> 01:06:58,110
How are you so good?

2004
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:00,750
Cause I don't need to learn like 20 plus moves.

2005
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:04,510
I just learn like 4 to 6, and then just perfect it.

2006
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:12,810
But you can't predict it, because like, I also throw in random button mashing, so they can never predict it.

2007
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:16,810
Cause it's like, which one is like...

2008
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:19,810
They don't know when like, it's the real match, you know?

2009
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:26,510
If I throw in random button mashing, they can't predict the moves.

2010
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:30,190
Oh my god, bro.

2011
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:30,550
Okay.

2012
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:33,550
Oh my god, she stopped it!

2013
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:37,810
She actually... She's gonna block this, isn't she?

2014
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:38,310
Goodbye.

2015
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,090
Look, she's red rank.

2016
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:44,290
She knows how to do it.

2017
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:46,690
When I learn a 7th move, I can beat her.

2018
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,070
That's all I'm saying.

2019
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:52,170
The moment I learn a 7th move, I can beat her.

2020
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:55,270
Oh my god, she fucking sucks!

2021
01:07:55,970 --> 01:07:57,110
Oh my god!

2022
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:02,090
Just saying, the 5th and 6th move got me to this elo.

2023
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:03,710
Not gonna lie.

2024
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:07,150
The 5th and 6th move got me here.

2025
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:09,770
Jesus!

2026
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:12,250
Holy fuck!

2027
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:17,130
Gotta start throwing out movement.

2028
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:18,350
Hahaha!

2029
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:21,770
Yay!

2030
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:24,010
Boop, boop!

2031
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:26,190
Goodbye!

2032
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:27,410
Yay!

2033
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:30,350
That was so close.

2034
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:33,670
Is she gonna...

2035
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:34,730
Yeah, oh, she is.

2036
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:38,190
Oh, I thought she was gonna duck.

2037
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:39,650
That's not fair.

2038
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:40,320
She didn't.

2039
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:43,530
Why didn't you duck?

2040
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:45,710
Why didn't you duck?

2041
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:47,290
Why!

2042
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:47,770
Why!

2043
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:49,970
Oh, now you duck?

2044
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:50,950
Okay, I didn't mean now.

2045
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:54,310
Don't start ducking!

2046
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:00,630
I didn't mean now!

2047
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:07,990
Can't believe it.

2048
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:11,230
Oh my god!

2049
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:14,530
Now she does that?!

2050
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:15,470
Bro!

2051
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:16,550
Uh...

2052
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:18,390
Hahaha!

2053
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:24,130
Why don't you duck when I don't want you to duck?!

2054
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:25,290
Bitch!

2055
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:28,190
There you go.

2056
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:31,550
Fuck off!

2057
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:34,030
Fuck off!

2058
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:35,970
Um...

2059
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:38,030
What the heck is a passcode?

2060
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:39,570
Oh no, we're starting.

2061
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:40,830
Oh no.

2062
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:41,510
Please.

2063
01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:45,390
Please, I'm getting juggled so hard right now.

2064
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:45,770
Please.

2065
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:47,870
Please get close to me.

2066
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:48,070
Oh, no.

2067
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:48,690
That's right.

2068
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:51,010
Hahaha!

2069
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,280
Give me a sec!

2070
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:58,940
Ah!

2071
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,100
Leave your elo!

2072
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:07,140
I'm gonna learn my seventh move and you're going down!

2073
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:09,220
The reds are going down!

2074
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:10,560
When I learn my seventh move.

2075
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,040
That's right, Doki's coming!

2076
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:13,920
Hahaha!

2077
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:15,720
Hahaha!

2078
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,720
The red rings!

2079
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,980
You're going down!

2080
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:21,720
Hahaha!

2081
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:23,500
Hahaha!

2082
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:25,620
Yay!

2083
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:27,620
Yay!

2084
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:28,800
Yippee!

2085
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,940
Alright, apparently, it matches.

2086
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,160
Hahaha!

2087
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:33,720
Hahaha!

2088
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,780
I'm like, am I one game off of red elo?

2089
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:41,440
Yo, team, you guys have to join the lobby.

2090
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:41,980
No!

2091
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:43,420
No!

2092
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:44,600
Alright, alright.

2093
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:49,080
I just beat a red ranker.

2094
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:49,740
Alright, alright, alright.

2095
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,340
Bro, I got a seven win streak.

2096
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:52,880
I'm so cli- Oh my god!

2097
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,120
Wait, I get promo?

2098
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,740
Are you fucking joking?

2099
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,240
I'm nine points off promo.

2100
01:10:59,560 --> 01:10:59,720
Hahaha!

2101
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:01,720
I think I'm gonna restart my computer after this.

2102
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,880
Make them wait for us so you can get your rank.

2103
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:04,540
Hahaha!

2104
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,380
I'm literally nine points off promo.

2105
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:07,660
That's insane.

2106
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,740
Oh my god.

2107
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,360
Alright, here we go.

2108
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:13,700
The ears don't go up.

2109
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:14,800
Oh, sorry.

2110
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:16,360
Oh...

2111
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:19,760
ESAM does a lot of slide for mid-range.

2112
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:20,860
I'm here.

2113
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:21,340
You remember that?

2114
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,060
Totally.

2115
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:24,300
Hahaha!

2116
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:28,940
Guys, it doesn't matter if I show the password.

2117
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,600
All my other teammates show their password already.

2118
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:34,200
So, like, I hide it, it doesn't matter.

2119
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:36,660
My teammates are showing the password.

2120
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,840
So, it doesn't matter.

2121
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,060
Hahaha!

2122
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,600
The code is right here.

2123
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:44,780
Thank you.

2124
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:46,740
I'm here.

2125
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:48,860
I'm ready.

2126
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,960
Okay, so what does ESAM do again?

2127
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,280
Okay, so what does ESAM do again?

2128
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,360
Remember when you played him last time?

2129
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:57,380
He did the slide a lot.

2130
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,860
He did the slide where it was low from mid-screen.

2131
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:01,860
So, do I just block low?

2132
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,220
Hahaha!

2133
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:05,900
I'm so confused.

2134
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:06,920
I don't remember.

2135
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,000
Hahaha!

2136
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:15,490
I'm so scared.

2137
01:12:16,150 --> 01:12:17,210
So, what do I do?

2138
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:22,150
Coach, what do I do?

2139
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:26,030
Wait, our coach left.

2140
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:28,970
Wait, our coach left.

2141
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:29,270
Well...

2142
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:30,170
What?

2143
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:33,430
Bro left and joined SageM!

2144
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:34,390
What?

2145
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:35,670
He didn't even tell me what to do!

2146
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:38,550
Well, Jason, yeah, that's pretty usual, I see.

2147
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:39,210
Hahaha!

2148
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:41,990
He didn't even tell me what to do!

2149
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:49,050
I can't believe it.

2150
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:51,910
I guess I'll never know what to do.

2151
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:52,290
I guess I'll never know what to do.

2152
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:55,860
Hahaha!

2153
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:56,640
Hahaha!

2154
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,460
Our coach went out to get milk, guys.

2155
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,280
Yeah, he'll come back.

2156
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:10,840
He'll come back, right?

2157
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:12,840
He'll come back to coach us, right guys?

2158
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,320
He'll come back to coach us, right guys?

2159
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:22,830
ESAM's not gonna know my low kick.

2160
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:23,170
ESAM's not gonna know my low kick.

2161
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:24,150
He won't expect it.

2162
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:32,960
We're just waiting.

2163
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,840
I think we're just waiting for them...

2164
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,960
for casters to be ready.

2165
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,080
at the moment chat.

2166
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:48,390
So we're just waiting for now.

2167
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:50,030
We're just waiting for now.

2168
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:52,790
Alright, I'm back team.

2169
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:54,550
Sorry they yoinked me for an interview.

2170
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:57,330
So what do I do?

2171
01:13:59,090 --> 01:13:59,610
Hahaha!

2172
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:02,890
Oh man...

2173
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:04,470
Um...

2174
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:06,850
You gotta...

2175
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:09,890
Okay, so if he's mid-range, he's gonna maybe do the slide.

2176
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:12,470
The punish on the slide might be...

2177
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:14,630
annoying to just...

2178
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:15,950
explain here.

2179
01:14:16,110 --> 01:14:17,030
Because you have to like...

2180
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:20,010
crouch cancel and then do the down-forward...

2181
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:20,350
What?

2182
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:21,390
Hahaha!

2183
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:25,390
Wait, crouch cancel?

2184
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:26,010
What?

2185
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:29,990
Okay, you have...

2186
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:32,710
If you block the slide, just alley kick him...

2187
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:33,350
three times.

2188
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:34,070
Okay.

2189
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:36,670
I got it.

2190
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:38,230
Just alley kick him three times.

2191
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:39,270
I know how to do that.

2192
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:42,550
And after the third alley kick, hit the right punch.

2193
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:43,790
It's a fourth hit.

2194
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:45,270
So that will also...

2195
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:45,470
Okay.

2196
01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:46,390
The right punch.

2197
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:49,570
Or you can also just while standing four.

2198
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:54,430
If you block low, then just hit four to do the while standing four.

2199
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:56,270
Oh no.

2200
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:57,750
He's doing the thing.

2201
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:00,950
Who's watching this?

2202
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:01,670
Who can spectate?

2203
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:03,670
Oh my god!

2204
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:04,890
Sam, please!

2205
01:15:06,690 --> 01:15:10,770
The worst part is like I hate fighting this guy in rank as well too!

2206
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:11,990
Oh my god!

2207
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:12,630
You know he's...

2208
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:12,910
He's purple!

2209
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:13,750
He can duck!

2210
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:14,730
Hahaha!

2211
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:19,290
Okay, you gotta hit him with the elbow.

2212
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:20,890
When you're sprinting.

2213
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:21,050
Okay.

2214
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:24,090
Yeah, he knows how to duck.

2215
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:25,930
So I have to...

2216
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:26,710
You think he'll duck this?

2217
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:28,250
Yes.

2218
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:32,630
Oh my god!

2219
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:34,670
Goodbye.

2220
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:36,170
Cruel world.

2221
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:37,810
Goodbye.

2222
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:40,490
The law is loud!

2223
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:42,970
Oh my god!

2224
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:45,230
This ass is just screaming!

2225
01:15:45,810 --> 01:15:47,650
That's why I'm watching this shit muted, dude.

2226
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:48,830
The law is annoying!

2227
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:53,050
I hate playing against law in general.

2228
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:54,150
Even in rank.

2229
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:56,510
Damn.

2230
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:57,610
It's so annoying.

2231
01:15:57,930 --> 01:15:58,670
Oh my god!

2232
01:15:58,690 --> 01:15:59,890
He just ducks everything!

2233
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:02,490
It's like he's been playing against King players his entire life!

2234
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:03,510
Hahaha!

2235
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:05,870
Hey guys.

2236
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:07,810
It was great existing.

2237
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:08,550
Hahaha!

2238
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:10,850
Hahaha!

2239
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:12,930
I existed!

2240
01:16:13,450 --> 01:16:13,970
Hahaha!

2241
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:16,450
Hahaha!

2242
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:19,750
You know...

2243
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:23,670
It went the way I expected it to go.

2244
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:23,890
I'm muting on your effect.

2245
01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:24,630
Oh, sorry.

2246
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:25,070
Hahaha!

2247
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:28,510
That's alright.

2248
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:30,610
He's a nerd.

2249
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:31,770
He is!

2250
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:33,310
He's a fucking nerd!

2251
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:35,390
We already talked about this.

2252
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:36,990
He wants the trip so bad.

2253
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:38,030
Oh my god!

2254
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:38,810
How does he...

2255
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:40,630
Hahaha!

2256
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,190
This character does a lot of stuff.

2257
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:45,430
Oh!

2258
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:46,250
Yes!

2259
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:47,310
That's fucking right!

2260
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:49,610
He didn't change for my alley kicks!

2261
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:52,170
That's freaking good!

2262
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:53,290
Hahaha!

2263
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:55,250
I got that.

2264
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:56,030
It's fine.

2265
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:56,850
That's a mighty ruler.

2266
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:59,050
This guy is purple.

2267
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:00,890
This guy is purple?

2268
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:03,210
He lets me alley kick him 20 times?

2269
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:05,130
Like, come on!

2270
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:05,750
Bro!

2271
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:07,650
Come on!

2272
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:07,730
Come on!

2273
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:10,250
Oh no!

2274
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:12,130
That's not it, guys!

2275
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:13,430
Guys, you jinxed it!

2276
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:13,850
Hahaha!

2277
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:15,350
Nice try.

2278
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:15,750
Nice try.

2279
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:17,870
You were alive for a while.

2280
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:18,530
I was.

2281
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:19,750
It was actually crazy.

2282
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:21,270
I've not been alive for that long.

2283
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:22,050
You almost cooked him.

2284
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:25,450
The worst part is like...

2285
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:27,710
I keep being on the right side.

2286
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:29,430
Hey!

2287
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:30,150
We're live!

2288
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:30,970
Don't give him the...

2289
01:17:30,970 --> 01:17:31,970
Don't give him the J.

2290
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:33,330
Oh shit!

2291
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:33,730
JK!

2292
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,290
I can pull it on both sides!

2293
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:36,350
I'm ambidextrous!

2294
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:37,910
I'm not though.

2295
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:41,510
What does he do?

2296
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:42,610
I don't know.

2297
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:43,870
Do you know?

2298
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:44,630
I don't know.

2299
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:46,570
I'm clicking buttons.

2300
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:48,350
Hell yeah.

2301
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:50,330
Let's go.

2302
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:51,850
He blocked that.

2303
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:53,630
He told me he wouldn't.

2304
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,630
Well, if he blocks it, then you grab him after.

2305
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:58,590
He told me he doesn't block those!

2306
01:17:59,230 --> 01:17:59,330
Hey!

2307
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:01,950
Hold up.

2308
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:02,890
Hold up.

2309
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:03,970
It's okay.

2310
01:18:04,030 --> 01:18:04,850
I got that one round.

2311
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:07,630
Remember, I got one round off of purple.

2312
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:10,550
That should be worth some points.

2313
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:11,890
Yeah, that should be worth some points.

2314
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:12,730
Yeah, that should be worth some points.

2315
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:14,770
He's literally smurfing at this point.

2316
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:17,750
Hey guys.

2317
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:20,070
I did not exist there.

2318
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:21,710
One point.

2319
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:23,450
One point.

2320
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:26,410
My handicap.

2321
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:27,750
That's fine.

2322
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:30,510
He's cheating.

2323
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:31,830
Yeah, honestly.

2324
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:34,930
The slide seems not fair.

2325
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:36,710
I think a nerf is in order.

2326
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:38,850
I think so too.

2327
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:40,790
I got Harada on the line.

2328
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:42,630
I got him on hold because I'm busy.

2329
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:48,110
So if I can't spectate, do I have to restart the lobby or the game?

2330
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:49,190
That's so annoying.

2331
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:51,210
Wait, are you the one who made that lobby?

2332
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:53,190
No, I think it was Tony.

2333
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,190
So you can't even join?

2334
01:18:58,910 --> 01:18:59,350
Uh...

2335
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:01,670
I'll just watch on Sajan.

2336
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:01,810
I'll just watch on Sajan.

2337
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:02,330
I'll just stream.

2338
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:04,230
No giving either of you.

2339
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:07,470
You're delayed.

2340
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:09,330
You're delayed to shit.

2341
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:10,490
I'm not anymore.

2342
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:11,850
I restarted my Tekken.

2343
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:12,730
I swear.

2344
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:15,950
I swear.

2345
01:19:16,930 --> 01:19:18,230
You still can't spectate?

2346
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:20,330
Let's see here.

2347
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:20,930
I cannot.

2348
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:21,590
Mine's up.

2349
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:25,770
Yup.

2350
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:29,090
Almost.

2351
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:35,890
Hell yeah.

2352
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:37,130
Oh!

2353
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,720
Oh my god, you bit his dick!

2354
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,080
Ah, that sucks.

2355
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:52,220
Remember, Tony, you can challenge that.

2356
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:53,860
The down two.

2357
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:59,820
Is blue higher than purple?

2358
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,140
Yeah, blue is higher.

2359
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:03,760
Not by much.

2360
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,580
Oh my goodness, we labbed.

2361
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,840
Let's go with the duck!

2362
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:10,680
Oh!

2363
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:13,860
Guaranteed a three?

2364
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:14,780
Three is good.

2365
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:17,820
Yeah.

2366
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:18,820
Oh, huge.

2367
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:20,360
Forgot it.

2368
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:22,380
Alley kick!

2369
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:22,740
Alley kick!

2370
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:24,800
Dude, I'm holding back.

2371
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:26,700
I feel like I'm holding back there.

2372
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:28,940
You got it.

2373
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:29,300
You got it.

2374
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,200
Island Coney, someone said.

2375
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:32,640
You got this.

2376
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,220
Oh my god, a grab.

2377
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:44,300
Oh my god.

2378
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:45,320
Yeah.

2379
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:46,600
Yes!

2380
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:48,260
Yes!

2381
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:49,320
Nice tech.

2382
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:49,960
Nice!

2383
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:52,960
I don't think that hits.

2384
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,120
Oh, you're so good.

2385
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:56,040
Oh, what?

2386
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:58,320
Yeah, I didn't think that would land.

2387
01:20:58,600 --> 01:20:59,520
Oh my god.

2388
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:01,380
That's funny that that landed.

2389
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:02,140
That's the end of the Rage Art.

2390
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:08,020
Come on, sweetheart.

2391
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,800
He fucking techs.

2392
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:12,800
Wow.

2393
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:17,040
Get him.

2394
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:18,740
Rage Art after back one two.

2395
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:19,760
Get him.

2396
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,100
Okay.

2397
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:22,800
All right, cool, cool.

2398
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:24,960
Nice.

2399
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,120
Yeah!

2400
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:32,560
Fight.

2401
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:45,660
Oh, you're such a GOAT.

2402
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:51,820
You know what the fuck to do.

2403
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:53,560
Nice.

2404
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,480
Oh my god.

2405
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:58,820
Can you press?

2406
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,360
What a fucking mugger.

2407
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:02,220
What the hell?

2408
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,140
That was a gorilla.

2409
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:04,120
Why do you need that?

2410
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:05,400
He didn't need that.

2411
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:06,300
All right.

2412
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:11,100
Yeah!

2413
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,220
The reverse started.

2414
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:16,220
Fight.

2415
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,120
That was a good block.

2416
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:36,210
Oh, he's so freaky and weird.

2417
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:37,990
Really?

2418
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:39,690
Yeah, counter hit.

2419
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:42,010
Okay.

2420
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,210
Like I know what to do.

2421
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:44,450
I'm just not fucking doing it.

2422
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:45,250
Yeah.

2423
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:49,510
When that down two hits while sending four, he's mashing after it.

2424
01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:50,630
Yeah, okay.

2425
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:51,990
That was very close.

2426
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:54,110
That's the only adjustment you need, I think.

2427
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:55,710
It's literally just that.

2428
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:59,010
Round one.

2429
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:02,470
Fight.

2430
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:04,050
Not on counter hit though.

2431
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:04,670
Yeah.

2432
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:12,590
Oh my god.

2433
01:23:12,890 --> 01:23:13,150
Yeah.

2434
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:18,510
Round two.

2435
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:19,970
Fight.

2436
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:21,530
Not.

2437
01:23:27,490 --> 01:23:28,470
Woo!

2438
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:31,070
Oh my god.

2439
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:33,090
God, it's the sweet fucking thing.

2440
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:34,490
Ah.

2441
01:23:35,890 --> 01:23:36,310
Damn.

2442
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:41,090
Freaky.

2443
01:23:44,030 --> 01:23:44,520
Six.

2444
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:49,630
Two.

2445
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,440
Okay.

2446
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:52,520
Nine.

2447
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:53,660
Adapt, adapt.

2448
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:55,880
Fight.

2449
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:08,740
Yeah.

2450
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:10,480
Oh my god.

2451
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:14,660
Yeah, Dragon is crazy.

2452
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,400
Dragon is still bullshit.

2453
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:17,360
Yeah.

2454
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:24,450
Yeah, I don't know, man.

2455
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:25,370
It's just fucking...

2456
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:25,970
Yeah, that's right.

2457
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:27,530
Yeah.

2458
01:24:28,350 --> 01:24:30,470
I had something and it's like...

2459
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:31,390
I don't know.

2460
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:31,890
That's alright.

2461
01:24:32,010 --> 01:24:33,190
We can run some drills.

2462
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:33,610
Yeah.

2463
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:35,030
It's no problem.

2464
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:37,690
We gotta play Freaky Josh now.

2465
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:38,790
Freaky.

2466
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:40,070
Freaky ass Josh.

2467
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,410
It's actually an entire freaky team.

2468
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:45,930
It's just so hard to predict.

2469
01:24:47,810 --> 01:24:48,510
It's just so hard to predict.

2470
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:51,690
Our teammates will win this for us, guys.

2471
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:52,370
Our teammates will win this for us, guys.

2472
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:59,000
I believe.

2473
01:24:59,500 --> 01:24:59,620
I believe.

2474
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:04,200
This is the second...

2475
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,620
Is this team second or third?

2476
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:05,700
Third.

2477
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:08,020
Second.

2478
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:09,120
Okay.

2479
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,240
I think.

2480
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:13,880
Yeah, this team is rebel-less.

2481
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:14,780
Okay.

2482
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:18,620
But they're tied, I think, for second though, if I'm not mistaken.

2483
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,600
I think they're like one point above.

2484
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:22,740
Is Kyle Delgado an AWP?

2485
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:25,080
Yeah, I don't know who this guy is.

2486
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,340
Nor do I know who Zin Megami Tensei is.

2487
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,120
That's Josh.

2488
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:30,940
I don't know who Kyle Delgado is.

2489
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,120
Yeah, probably just like a streamer guy.

2490
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:35,900
Yeah, just gotta kick him.

2491
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:38,660
That's annoying.

2492
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,860
Someone kick Kyle.

2493
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,400
No one's gonna play you, bro.

2494
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,000
Someone kick Kyle.

2495
01:25:59,280 --> 01:25:59,940
Fuck ye.

2496
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,480
Wait, what's the pass going?

2497
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:04,040
1-9-1-9.

2498
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,500
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

2499
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:07,320
It doesn't matter.

2500
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:09,440
Like, everybody's seen the passcode already.

2501
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:11,620
I bet you can see it in Sejam's stream too.

2502
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:13,300
I bet you can see it in Sejam's stream too.

2503
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:14,760
JoshmanReadyedUp is fucking stupid.

2504
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,200
He's the stupidest person I think I've ever met.

2505
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:18,540
In my whole life, ever.

2506
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:19,760
Ranked.

2507
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:21,340
Ranked number one on the PR.

2508
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:28,610
Did someone leak the code?

2509
01:26:29,170 --> 01:26:31,090
The code is on screen.

2510
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:31,250
The code is on screen.

2511
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:33,090
Yeah, I was like, what does he mean?

2512
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:36,710
Wait, Sejam actually hides the passcode?

2513
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:38,330
Oh, it's our fault, I guess.

2514
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:44,480
Not in my screen.

2515
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,100
We all got a...

2516
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:50,740
Oh, god.

2517
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:53,520
And this is why he's secretly bald.

2518
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,540
Do we actually have to hide the code?

2519
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:03,120
Does Sejam want us to censor the code somehow?

2520
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:06,220
I don't have the elements in my OBS.

2521
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:07,600
I don't have the elements in my OBS.

2522
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:08,280
Just get a picture.

2523
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,940
Like, put a white bar on it.

2524
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,580
I don't have the element.

2525
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:13,840
I don't have the element.

2526
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,300
Blackbar.png Yeah.

2527
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:21,800
Wait, so what's happening?

2528
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:22,860
How do I get in?

2529
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,120
Brr.

2530
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,400
Oh, I see, I see.

2531
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:28,820
Alright, where are we going?

2532
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:30,120
The Rage Art button, brother.

2533
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:32,160
So Rage Art...

2534
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:41,040
Remember, Slime, when he back ones, he generally likes to back one again right after, so you can maybe G-cliff that a couple times.

2535
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:46,360
And then he's gonna start back one-ing into the 1-2 strings, which will beat your G-cliffs.

2536
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:49,940
So if you're making the read, you can just hold back and be safe.

2537
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:51,100
Or...

2538
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:55,020
you can down back four for a huge call-out, because that'll crush the high, I think.

2539
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:59,800
But, I mean, if you just hold back against Brian, he can only hit you with his hatchet.

2540
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,460
And I guess, like, his...

2541
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:03,400
wall stuff.

2542
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:04,420
But, I mean...

2543
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:06,300
depends on the stage.

2544
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,520
For the wall stuff, pretty much, though.

2545
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,820
Holding back, definitely more...

2546
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:12,960
safe.

2547
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:14,740
Yeah.

2548
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:16,780
Yup.

2549
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:20,140
Good luck.

2550
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,120
The walls are good for you as well.

2551
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:23,000
You got this.

2552
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:26,280
Can Bear break floor easy?

2553
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:27,540
Yeah.

2554
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:37,750
Good shit.

2555
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:39,330
Take him to the wall!

2556
01:28:40,050 --> 01:28:41,090
What a hot kick.

2557
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:42,310
Oh.

2558
01:28:42,510 --> 01:28:42,990
Good shit.

2559
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:46,390
Remember, when he's pressuring you, he bursts as a free get-out-of-jail card for you.

2560
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:47,010
Okay.

2561
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:50,960
Yeah!

2562
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:53,400
No, did that mistake again.

2563
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:54,040
Round 2.

2564
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,480
Fight!

2565
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:02,020
Dude, what?

2566
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:04,820
Oh my god!

2567
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:06,720
Back 2-2-1 with a combo.

2568
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:07,600
Back 2-2-1.

2569
01:29:11,270 --> 01:29:11,710
Oh.

2570
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:13,170
Nice.

2571
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:15,350
Oh, what?

2572
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:18,130
Good shambler.

2573
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:20,630
Oh my god!

2574
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:21,790
Can't believe that connected.

2575
01:29:22,570 --> 01:29:23,510
Now this is bad.

2576
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:24,850
It's okay.

2577
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:30,710
Nice.

2578
01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:31,910
Good block, Josh.

2579
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:34,110
Alright, no more cell sweeps.

2580
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:38,690
Roll full crash down forward once, then it's safe.

2581
01:29:38,950 --> 01:29:39,430
Yup.

2582
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:40,130
Good job.

2583
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:43,210
I'm gonna finish that.

2584
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:47,330
Oh.

2585
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:50,190
Oh.

2586
01:29:50,190 --> 01:29:50,850
Round 3.

2587
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:51,810
Nice.

2588
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:52,370
Fight!

2589
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:56,130
Not breaking that in a hundred years.

2590
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:57,050
He's making a lot of chip.

2591
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:00,310
Nice!

2592
01:30:01,810 --> 01:30:02,250
Oh.

2593
01:30:02,650 --> 01:30:03,090
Bummer.

2594
01:30:03,290 --> 01:30:04,270
Damn, get off the floor.

2595
01:30:04,530 --> 01:30:07,290
I mean, your hits have a lot of damage though.

2596
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:08,750
You don't have to worry about it anymore.

2597
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:09,390
Yup.

2598
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:11,710
He's gonna pop heat.

2599
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:13,110
Probably blow heat smash by the way.

2600
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:13,730
I'm just gonna chill.

2601
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:18,590
Oh my god.

2602
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:28,580
Good shit.

2603
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:29,720
G-Klev doing work.

2604
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,200
That's a little D-Klev.

2605
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:32,680
Let's go.

2606
01:30:43,890 --> 01:30:44,370
Nice.

2607
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:45,710
Good orbital, Josh.

2608
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:47,750
Okay.

2609
01:30:59,910 --> 01:31:00,390
Nice.

2610
01:31:00,610 --> 01:31:01,090
Nice.

2611
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:09,420
Nice.

2612
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:09,780
Nice.

2613
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:09,980
Good shit.

2614
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,980
Oh my god.

2615
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:14,160
I can't see it yet.

2616
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:16,320
Good job.

2617
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:18,280
One more.

2618
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:20,500
Woo!

2619
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:24,220
Okay, that was sick though.

2620
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,420
I just got to it.

2621
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:33,400
Nice grab.

2622
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:37,680
Nice grab.

2623
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:37,720
Nice grab.

2624
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:37,960
Nice fight.

2625
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:41,700
What?

2626
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:43,320
Oh.

2627
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:46,380
Okay.

2628
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:57,180
Wow.

2629
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,120
Good shit.

2630
01:31:58,700 --> 01:31:59,780
Very electric.

2631
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,260
He fucking broke the floor.

2632
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:03,440
Another bounce.

2633
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:12,110
Hell yeah.

2634
01:32:12,710 --> 01:32:13,470
Got him.

2635
01:32:13,550 --> 01:32:14,050
Look at that.

2636
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:14,770
That full crouch.

2637
01:32:14,850 --> 01:32:15,230
Yeah!

2638
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:15,930
Okay.

2639
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:17,650
Full crouch down.

2640
01:32:17,690 --> 01:32:17,830
Good shit.

2641
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:24,470
Thought I'd get crazy with it.

2642
01:32:24,650 --> 01:32:25,890
Nice orbital, Josh.

2643
01:32:26,930 --> 01:32:27,950
You're such a goat.

2644
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:30,050
Runs in the room.

2645
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:31,010
Fucking smacks you.

2646
01:32:39,990 --> 01:32:40,670
Nice grab.

2647
01:32:42,030 --> 01:32:42,990
No more autopilot.

2648
01:32:43,550 --> 01:32:45,150
How do I get up and block that?

2649
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:47,130
I keep fucking... is that... is that true?

2650
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,170
That might be real.

2651
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:50,190
I'm not very clear.

2652
01:32:50,510 --> 01:32:51,430
I'm not sure.

2653
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:53,130
We can lab it tonight.

2654
01:32:57,070 --> 01:32:58,470
You can hit up and down.

2655
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:00,790
Oh beautiful.

2656
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:03,330
I'm gonna see it soon.

2657
01:33:05,130 --> 01:33:06,170
Oh I saw it.

2658
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:07,790
Sick combo.

2659
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:09,050
Sick fucking combo.

2660
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:09,530
Sick fucking combo.

2661
01:33:09,930 --> 01:33:10,490
Oh.

2662
01:33:13,550 --> 01:33:14,370
He's backing.

2663
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:16,170
He's scared.

2664
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:19,990
What?

2665
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:20,710
Good duck.

2666
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:21,250
Whoa.

2667
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:22,350
Nice.

2668
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:24,750
I'm seeing it.

2669
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:25,430
Oh.

2670
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:25,750
Nice.

2671
01:33:39,450 --> 01:33:39,930
Nice.

2672
01:33:39,930 --> 01:33:40,010
Nice.

2673
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:41,510
Nice.

2674
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:47,460
Nice.

2675
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:47,900
Good job, Josh.

2676
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:50,460
Guys, don't spoil the ending for me.

2677
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:51,060
Does he win?

2678
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:53,860
Not yet.

2679
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,720
He said not yet locked in.

2680
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:57,300
Not yet.

2681
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:02,020
Good job.

2682
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:12,330
I hate this fucking character in that fucking stupid move.

2683
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:13,210
I fucking hate it.

2684
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:15,370
That's a good move, yeah.

2685
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:15,790
That's a good move, yeah.

2686
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:25,640
Oh.

2687
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:32,690
Fuck.

2688
01:34:32,850 --> 01:34:33,210
Oh.

2689
01:34:33,930 --> 01:34:34,490
Oh.

2690
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:35,330
Dude.

2691
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:35,870
It's my fault.

2692
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:36,390
It's my fault.

2693
01:34:37,610 --> 01:34:38,650
It might kill me here.

2694
01:34:39,810 --> 01:34:40,710
This wall.

2695
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:43,910
Yeah.

2696
01:34:44,490 --> 01:34:46,350
I'm gonna start command grabbing more.

2697
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:51,770
He has no reason to duck after you're in HBS because you're not doing an HBS.

2698
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:52,930
He's gonna take the grab after.

2699
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:53,910
You know what I mean?

2700
01:34:54,030 --> 01:34:56,210
So that's why he's not ducking.

2701
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:59,910
You have to threaten the hunting bear stance grab.

2702
01:35:01,650 --> 01:35:02,710
And you got this.

2703
01:35:02,710 --> 01:35:03,550
You got this in the set.

2704
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:06,310
If you get the grab and break the floor, it's back 2-2-1.

2705
01:35:13,590 --> 01:35:14,630
He's just spamming that.

2706
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:16,710
You can duck punish that, right?

2707
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:17,570
You can duck it, yes.

2708
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:27,180
He destroyed you.

2709
01:35:36,450 --> 01:35:37,010
Okay.

2710
01:35:42,730 --> 01:35:44,250
I'm synced back up.

2711
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:56,940
Oh nice.

2712
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:58,920
I fucking jabbed, dude.

2713
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:00,540
I'm so annoyed.

2714
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,100
And I rolled back into him.

2715
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:07,400
Oh.

2716
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:09,980
So close.

2717
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:17,460
Nice.

2718
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:30,140
Nice.

2719
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:32,380
Yeah, focus on your bear stance.

2720
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:33,080
Nice!

2721
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:34,120
Alright.

2722
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:37,800
Got this.

2723
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:41,100
What in the fuck?

2724
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:42,920
There you go, bro.

2725
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:43,820
Back 2-2-1.

2726
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:45,600
There it is.

2727
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:46,640
Back 2-2-1 and twice.

2728
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:46,940
Nice.

2729
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:52,080
That's fine.

2730
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:53,760
There you go, bro.

2731
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:54,940
You need that hunting bear stance.

2732
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:56,220
That's gonna force your mix, dude.

2733
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:56,840
There you go.

2734
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:58,300
Good shit!

2735
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:00,220
That's 2 in a row!

2736
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:02,000
Final round.

2737
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:03,280
Fight.

2738
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,040
Oh, that was bad.

2739
01:37:07,180 --> 01:37:08,080
I gotta do the command grab.

2740
01:37:18,150 --> 01:37:18,910
Nice, orbital.

2741
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:20,850
Nice, orbital.

2742
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:23,350
Nice, orbital.

2743
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:23,710
Hmm.

2744
01:37:26,230 --> 01:37:26,670
Winnable.

2745
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:27,050
Very.

2746
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:36,180
I think I'm dead here.

2747
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:38,600
I dead-ass radar'd it too.

2748
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:39,880
Aw.

2749
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:41,300
That was close.

2750
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:41,840
That's okay.

2751
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:42,840
Last round.

2752
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:43,500
Super close.

2753
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:44,740
I mean like, final final, right?

2754
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:45,160
Yeah.

2755
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:50,840
I hate losing to him so much.

2756
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,340
I fucking hate losing to Josh.

2757
01:37:55,820 --> 01:37:56,660
Oh, god.

2758
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:57,120
Good news.

2759
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:59,240
Definitely go to his room right now.

2760
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:00,380
No.

2761
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:04,420
The thing is, I would never pop off like he popped off.

2762
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:05,480
That's the difference.

2763
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:07,400
That's the Pepsi difference.

2764
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:09,280
The Pepsi difference?

2765
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:10,240
What's that?

2766
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:12,660
He's so miserable to lose against.

2767
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,540
Oh my god, I'm losing my mind.

2768
01:38:19,420 --> 01:38:20,520
Oh, he's giving me props?

2769
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,440
That's really cool.

2770
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,520
Was he giving me props when he went...

2771
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:28,420
Pussy?

2772
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:33,660
It's okay.

2773
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:35,340
That's your...

2774
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:36,600
Oh, I'm so mad.

2775
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:40,980
This dude boxboxes hella random, bro.

2776
01:38:41,260 --> 01:38:41,700
What the fuck?

2777
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:42,880
Yeah, you got a mission.

2778
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:45,140
You haven't lost yet.

2779
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:47,240
Come on, Matt.

2780
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:48,720
You got to redeem us.

2781
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:49,620
I got it, man.

2782
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:51,000
I don't know dude.

2783
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,380
This guy is so fucking random.

2784
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,180
You say that every time and you win every time.

2785
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:56,680
Yeah.

2786
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:57,260
I don't know what's for Brian.

2787
01:38:59,020 --> 01:38:59,820
Cut.

2788
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:04,620
Cool.

2789
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:10,140
Yeah...

2790
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:11,040
Whoa,

2791
01:39:17,090 --> 01:39:17,630
whoa, whoa!

2792
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:18,830
Not that move, bro.

2793
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:25,820
Okay...

2794
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:27,200
Alright, that's one.

2795
01:39:35,950 --> 01:39:37,250
Round 2.

2796
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:38,710
Fight!

2797
01:39:41,870 --> 01:39:42,390
Nice!

2798
01:39:48,710 --> 01:39:50,850
Yeah, that's crazy the dem links.

2799
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:51,630
Oh my god.

2800
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:54,710
This stage is a good Jax stage too.

2801
01:39:56,270 --> 01:39:57,910
So we got like good RNG?

2802
01:39:58,470 --> 01:39:59,410
Good rotation?

2803
01:39:59,430 --> 01:39:59,630
Yeah.

2804
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:00,270
Nice.

2805
01:40:00,290 --> 01:40:00,550
Definitely.

2806
01:40:02,490 --> 01:40:03,490
Another rotation?

2807
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:04,750
Oh, not fully.

2808
01:40:04,850 --> 01:40:05,710
You can rotate it.

2809
01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:08,250
Did you pick this stage on purpose?

2810
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:09,630
Or was it random?

2811
01:40:09,850 --> 01:40:10,630
Oh shit.

2812
01:40:10,870 --> 01:40:12,010
Oh we blocked this.

2813
01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:14,790
Oh, I forgot that Asuka's bullshit!

2814
01:40:15,290 --> 01:40:16,490
We blocked it.

2815
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:24,300
I just saw him block it.

2816
01:40:31,370 --> 01:40:31,930
Shit!

2817
01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:33,190
Okay.

2818
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:36,210
Don't let us get swept!

2819
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:36,970
Save us!

2820
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:41,810
We still have Braum, bro!

2821
01:40:42,070 --> 01:40:43,070
We still have him!

2822
01:40:45,010 --> 01:40:46,450
Don't rely on me.

2823
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:48,510
I'm coming off an L.

2824
01:40:51,210 --> 01:40:52,490
No way!

2825
01:40:52,490 --> 01:40:53,230
You'll lose.

2826
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:02,280
That's too much damage.

2827
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:02,880
Jesus!

2828
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,020
There should be more because...

2829
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:05,760
There's a wall there!

2830
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:09,620
Oh my god!

2831
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:11,160
That's the...

2832
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:11,920
Honestly!

2833
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:14,860
We need this.

2834
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:16,180
Oh my god.

2835
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:18,380
That was the Joe crush, bro!

2836
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,240
Carry my ass!

2837
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,160
I hate that trick so much.

2838
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:29,060
You have no idea.

2839
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,380
Oh my god, what?

2840
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:38,380
Oh, really?

2841
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:43,220
Okay, never do that to Bokoblins.

2842
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:46,020
Yeah!

2843
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:48,580
The FD Fire Slayer!

2844
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:52,120
Yeah, he came back from that shit.

2845
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:53,100
I'm gonna go back to the game.

2846
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:53,300
I'm gonna go back to the game.

2847
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:55,840
Oh, fucking boxbox, bro.

2848
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:57,700
What the fuck is he doing to you?

2849
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:58,920
I don't know.

2850
01:42:05,390 --> 01:42:06,490
Oh my god!

2851
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:07,110
Oh!

2852
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:08,870
He's locking it in!

2853
01:42:08,910 --> 01:42:09,130
That's alright.

2854
01:42:10,110 --> 01:42:12,870
Scott, make it close.

2855
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:15,950
See the delay?

2856
01:42:16,690 --> 01:42:17,910
Oh my god!

2857
01:42:18,890 --> 01:42:20,010
Yeah, that was a nice delay.

2858
01:42:20,230 --> 01:42:20,830
For his duck.

2859
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:27,430
Oh, I can't game Jesus.

2860
01:42:28,230 --> 01:42:28,710
Gaming!

2861
01:42:28,710 --> 01:42:29,850
That shot was nuts!

2862
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:33,590
If only King has missile hands, he'll be perfect.

2863
01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:42,240
He really reacts to that.

2864
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:43,720
That's crazy for a New York player.

2865
01:42:49,550 --> 01:42:50,030
Jesus.

2866
01:42:53,450 --> 01:42:54,610
Don't let him stand up!

2867
01:42:54,770 --> 01:42:55,650
Keep him on the floor!

2868
01:42:56,290 --> 01:42:57,350
How does he do it?

2869
01:42:57,710 --> 01:42:58,190
Yeah!

2870
01:42:58,230 --> 01:42:59,450
Fucking insane, dude.

2871
01:42:59,570 --> 01:42:59,970
Let's go.

2872
01:43:00,290 --> 01:43:01,630
Let's fucking go!

2873
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:04,990
Just when you think he's at his lowest!

2874
01:43:06,290 --> 01:43:07,290
He's a miracle!

2875
01:43:08,070 --> 01:43:09,290
Slightly more correct.

2876
01:43:09,570 --> 01:43:11,430
I'm gonna suddenly duck the grab.

2877
01:43:11,730 --> 01:43:13,190
Because I can't tick grabs.

2878
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:15,550
We didn't get swept, guys!

2879
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:17,270
Thank god.

2880
01:43:17,430 --> 01:43:18,290
Thank god!

2881
01:43:18,290 --> 01:43:19,250
Matt did it!

2882
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:20,270
He saved us!

2883
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:22,150
Always a miracle.

2884
01:43:22,290 --> 01:43:23,210
It's tough, man.

2885
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:25,990
Yeah, man.

2886
01:43:26,090 --> 01:43:28,070
There's a reason they're top top right now.

2887
01:43:28,330 --> 01:43:29,610
They're right below us.

2888
01:43:29,810 --> 01:43:31,110
He was playing hella good too.

2889
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:34,850
He wasn't optimizing, but he was doing pretty good.

2890
01:43:35,030 --> 01:43:35,390
Yeah.

2891
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:36,790
Not good enough.

2892
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:39,730
Too touching, man.

2893
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:41,990
You guess wrong twice and you die.

2894
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:42,530
Yeah.

2895
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:49,040
Alright, we got our five points.

2896
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:50,400
Yippee.

2897
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:51,940
Yeah, good job, guys.

2898
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:03,200
Oh, coach, you got this.

2899
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:04,960
Redeem us too.

2900
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:06,400
The sequel.

2901
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:08,780
I'll just play my best.

2902
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:20,420
Good shit.

2903
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:21,340
Nice.

2904
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:27,060
Dude!

2905
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:28,400
Oh my god!

2906
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:29,820
Take him to the wall!

2907
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:32,700
Perfect!

2908
01:44:36,180 --> 01:44:37,180
He's pressing.

2909
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:45,120
That's my fucking coach.

2910
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:46,500
Oh my god.

2911
01:44:58,890 --> 01:45:01,530
Oh, you can't rage dart after that because he's mad.

2912
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:03,590
Scary.

2913
01:45:04,050 --> 01:45:04,550
Yeah.

2914
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:19,060
Come on!

2915
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,100
Yes!

2916
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:28,780
Good shit!

2917
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:32,600
Nice.

2918
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:36,960
Yes, sir!

2919
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:39,680
Good shit!

2920
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:40,480
Nice!

2921
01:45:44,530 --> 01:45:45,890
And there was an alley kick!

2922
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:49,130
For the fans?

2923
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:50,190
For the fans!

2924
01:45:50,190 --> 01:45:50,710
For the people in the back?

2925
01:45:52,390 --> 01:45:55,690
I've been hitting him with a lot of mids, so I'm surprised he's dunking.

2926
01:45:58,310 --> 01:45:59,630
It's because he sees King.

2927
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:00,130
He always sees King.

2928
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:01,510
He automatically ducks because of it.

2929
01:46:11,830 --> 01:46:13,590
That wall was...

2930
01:46:14,810 --> 01:46:15,190
Yeah.

2931
01:46:17,790 --> 01:46:19,810
But they can float the wall.

2932
01:46:20,850 --> 01:46:21,430
Fight!

2933
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:23,130
Oh.

2934
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:33,070
Oh, man.

2935
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:34,030
That sucks.

2936
01:46:34,030 --> 01:46:34,110
That sucks.

2937
01:46:42,670 --> 01:46:43,770
The dick move!

2938
01:46:44,210 --> 01:46:44,850
That's right.

2939
01:46:45,010 --> 01:46:45,230
That's right.

2940
01:46:45,670 --> 01:46:46,830
You got this, coach.

2941
01:46:47,210 --> 01:46:48,610
Yeah, you got the second set.

2942
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:49,150
Look at the wall.

2943
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:11,640
Nice.

2944
01:47:15,850 --> 01:47:16,370
Oh!

2945
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:17,830
Good shit!

2946
01:47:20,110 --> 01:47:20,970
Oh, shit.

2947
01:47:25,950 --> 01:47:26,990
Oh, Jacey.

2948
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:28,950
Oh!

2949
01:47:30,670 --> 01:47:31,590
Muscle buster!

2950
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:32,650
The muscle buster!

2951
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:34,510
Brian.

2952
01:47:34,730 --> 01:47:35,230
Freaky Brian.

2953
01:47:35,290 --> 01:47:35,790
Does that hurt?

2954
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:36,410
Freaky Brian?

2955
01:47:36,830 --> 01:47:38,490
Does it hurt, Freaky Brian?

2956
01:47:42,230 --> 01:47:44,730
It's hard to hit confirm when that down forward 2 connects.

2957
01:47:45,050 --> 01:47:45,730
But it hits.

2958
01:47:52,130 --> 01:47:53,710
These guys are smoothing, man.

2959
01:47:53,890 --> 01:47:55,270
Yeah, he's like dancing.

2960
01:47:56,030 --> 01:47:56,830
Nice tackle.

2961
01:47:58,450 --> 01:48:00,550
It's like those YouTube videos that are like perfect.

2962
01:48:00,850 --> 01:48:01,670
It's in the wall.

2963
01:48:03,450 --> 01:48:04,890
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2964
01:48:05,850 --> 01:48:06,290
Aww.

2965
01:48:06,990 --> 01:48:08,450
Dude, he's good at this.

2966
01:48:08,470 --> 01:48:08,690
Yeah.

2967
01:48:10,770 --> 01:48:13,310
I feel like he trained specifically against kings.

2968
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:14,790
Oh!

2969
01:48:15,970 --> 01:48:16,410
Mario!

2970
01:48:17,910 --> 01:48:18,350
Yes!

2971
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:19,730
I could not believe you got away with that.

2972
01:48:19,990 --> 01:48:20,350
Oh!

2973
01:48:23,130 --> 01:48:24,010
Fade back.

2974
01:48:24,150 --> 01:48:24,510
Fade back.

2975
01:48:25,370 --> 01:48:26,010
That's the mango.

2976
01:48:26,010 --> 01:48:26,990
That's the mango.

2977
01:48:27,150 --> 01:48:27,690
That's the mango.

2978
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:31,450
Nice!

2979
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:33,550
That's a lot.

2980
01:48:33,610 --> 01:48:34,450
That's a lot of damage.

2981
01:48:34,870 --> 01:48:36,470
Oh my god, the Jaguar run nothing?

2982
01:48:36,630 --> 01:48:37,350
This is too scary.

2983
01:48:37,470 --> 01:48:37,950
I can't.

2984
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:40,170
Yeah, the sudden pause.

2985
01:48:41,110 --> 01:48:41,590
Oh!

2986
01:48:43,090 --> 01:48:43,870
Break his leg!

2987
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:44,770
Break it, bro.

2988
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:47,730
Sharp shooter.

2989
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:50,050
Are you gonna rotate him?

2990
01:48:53,130 --> 01:48:55,010
There's been so many people rotated today.

2991
01:48:55,010 --> 01:48:55,530
Yeah.

2992
01:48:55,610 --> 01:48:55,690
Yeah.

2993
01:48:59,070 --> 01:49:01,070
The thing about Freaky Brian is he likes to...

2994
01:49:01,070 --> 01:49:01,590
Oh!

2995
01:49:01,630 --> 01:49:02,190
Big hopkick!

2996
01:49:02,930 --> 01:49:03,450
Nice!

2997
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:06,350
Oh!

2998
01:49:07,450 --> 01:49:08,310
Should be everything.

2999
01:49:08,410 --> 01:49:08,690
Oh!

3000
01:49:10,090 --> 01:49:10,610
Damn.

3001
01:49:11,310 --> 01:49:12,270
It's a hard combo.

3002
01:49:15,630 --> 01:49:16,150
Oh!

3003
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:16,610
Oh!

3004
01:49:16,710 --> 01:49:17,530
I wish I hit that.

3005
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:19,370
Round four.

3006
01:49:20,430 --> 01:49:20,950
Fight!

3007
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:30,460
Oh, he teched it.

3008
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:32,620
Oh, Kingfisher mash.

3009
01:49:34,540 --> 01:49:35,120
Nice!

3010
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:36,180
Nice!

3011
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:39,480
All the sidewall adjustment.

3012
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:39,780
Yeah.

3013
01:49:39,860 --> 01:49:41,660
Sidewall adjustment is crazy here.

3014
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:42,320
You're nuts.

3015
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:46,840
My music fucking popping off.

3016
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:50,080
I got Rebel Hanger final round playing.

3017
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:51,200
I got Rebel Hanger final round playing.

3018
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:51,540
Oh wow.

3019
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:03,770
Woo!

3020
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:05,180
Oh, that's scary.

3021
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:08,940
Oh!

3022
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:09,460
Oh!

3023
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:10,000
Nice try.

3024
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:10,520
He's clutching.

3025
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:13,560
Get him, Monk.

3026
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:14,580
Get him, Monk!

3027
01:50:14,980 --> 01:50:15,860
Come on, coach!

3028
01:50:24,510 --> 01:50:25,170
Nice!

3029
01:50:28,310 --> 01:50:29,770
What a fucking dodge.

3030
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:33,430
What?

3031
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:41,180
This is a bad spot to be in.

3032
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:46,400
Not the dick move.

3033
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:47,520
Oh, that's...

3034
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:49,320
No way!

3035
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:52,840
Nice try.

3036
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:54,320
Oh, nice try.

3037
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:56,120
Oh my god.

3038
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:57,880
He's very clutch.

3039
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:58,580
Jesus.

3040
01:50:58,700 --> 01:50:59,140
Yeah.

3041
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:01,660
Didn't get sweeped.

3042
01:51:02,180 --> 01:51:03,680
Hey, I did get sweeped.

3043
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,620
Yeah, we needed that.

3044
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:07,500
That was for the portal.

3045
01:51:07,860 --> 01:51:09,560
That guy is really good.

3046
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:10,080
Fuck.

3047
01:51:11,230 --> 01:51:12,600
That guy was insane.

3048
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:16,120
Let's just hope that one of the teams beat them.

3049
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:19,440
I know Tone really, really, really wants to win too.

3050
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:21,020
Like, he wanted me on his team and shit.

3051
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:22,360
Like, he was like, hey, Matt.

3052
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:23,500
Hey, Matt.

3053
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:25,880
Wouldn't it be cool if you're on my team?

3054
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:26,520
Woo!

3055
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:31,040
Oh my gosh.

3056
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:32,240
We're definitely gonna see them.

3057
01:51:32,460 --> 01:51:34,600
They're definitely getting one of the buys, I feel.

3058
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:35,480
Oh yeah.

3059
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:38,660
I think it's gonna be between us and MYK's team.

3060
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:39,780
We're just trying to get the other one.

3061
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:40,160
Yeah.

3062
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:44,360
I fucking love that, dude.

3063
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:46,620
That is the turtle tweet.

3064
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,300
Oh my god.

3065
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:50,160
That one was intense.

3066
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:51,720
That felt like the finals.

3067
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:54,180
Oh.

3068
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:56,400
Did you guys see the...

3069
01:51:57,060 --> 01:51:58,200
Our team's over.

3070
01:51:58,380 --> 01:51:58,920
Our team's over.

3071
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:00,900
The Brawl Pro chat.

3072
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:02,340
The Brawl Pro?

3073
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:04,540
Our team chat.

3074
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:04,580
Oh yeah.

3075
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:06,800
In the fucking hilarious blind.

3076
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:07,960
Oh yeah.

3077
01:52:09,740 --> 01:52:11,120
Yeah, that was kind of funny.

3078
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:11,420
That was good.

3079
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:19,780
Damn, losing kind of sucks.

3080
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:21,780
Losing sucks, dude.

3081
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:23,560
Oh my god.

3082
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:24,800
That's why we're competitors.

3083
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:29,620
That's why we lose now, so we get motivated to win.

3084
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:35,300
You have so much advice in the chat and you just don't want to read any of it either, you know?

3085
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:36,860
I know, because you want to walk in and shit.

3086
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:38,720
Like, oh, go Paul.

3087
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:39,000
Go Paul.

3088
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:42,000
It's like, fuck, I do not feel like listening to this.

3089
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:46,920
Now I know you're a streamer.

3090
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:49,980
It's okay, guys.

3091
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:51,320
That was the hardest team.

3092
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:52,880
Now, like...

3093
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:55,100
Now...

3094
01:52:55,940 --> 01:52:56,860
Now it's easy.

3095
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:58,160
I literally just don't look at chat.

3096
01:52:58,300 --> 01:52:59,600
For the rest of my teammates.

3097
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:01,800
I minimize the window.

3098
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:02,760
I just play the game.

3099
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:04,500
Now it's easy.

3100
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:06,380
I got it.

3101
01:53:07,340 --> 01:53:08,080
It's for them.

3102
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:09,300
I'm going to go for the perspective.

3103
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:10,000
You know what?

3104
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:10,380
That's true.

3105
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:15,540
We got the hardest team out of the way.

3106
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:18,000
The five alley kicks of the dream right here.

3107
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:19,540
The five alley kicks of the dream right here.

3108
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:22,260
What the fuck, Shinru?

3109
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:22,420
What the fuck, Shinru?

3110
01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:24,240
Isn't that higher than Garu?

3111
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:27,460
What is she doing in my lobby?

3112
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,280
I'm a baby!

3113
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:34,160
Bro, I literally just fought ESAM.

3114
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:35,060
Leave me alone.

3115
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:36,440
Like...

3116
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:41,740
Leave me the fuck alone!

3117
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:42,600
Leave me the fuck alone!

3118
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:43,720
I literally had to fight!

3119
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:44,820
What the fuck?

3120
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:45,120
Okay.

3121
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:46,980
I got confused too.

3122
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:47,460
I'm sorry.

3123
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:52,800
Oh my god, please.

3124
01:53:53,140 --> 01:53:54,760
I had to fight ESAM.

3125
01:53:55,060 --> 01:53:56,640
Get out of my lobby!

3126
01:53:57,460 --> 01:53:59,500
Get out of my lobby!

3127
01:54:03,090 --> 01:54:03,710
Okay.

3128
01:54:06,670 --> 01:54:07,410
Oh god.

3129
01:54:07,490 --> 01:54:07,790
No!

3130
01:54:07,950 --> 01:54:08,390
No!

3131
01:54:10,410 --> 01:54:11,250
Let's go team!

3132
01:54:12,310 --> 01:54:13,390
Alright, here we go.

3133
01:54:13,570 --> 01:54:15,530
God, they really fucked the vibes up.

3134
01:54:15,970 --> 01:54:16,950
Not really.

3135
01:54:17,150 --> 01:54:17,470
We got it.

3136
01:54:17,470 --> 01:54:20,730
The only thing is when winners lose, it's like...

3137
01:54:20,730 --> 01:54:21,910
It's like god...

3138
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:25,290
It's like god is turning down his head.

3139
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:26,250
It doesn't make sense.

3140
01:54:26,290 --> 01:54:26,470
What?

3141
01:54:26,670 --> 01:54:28,430
How did she sidestep that?

3142
01:54:29,430 --> 01:54:31,010
I'm fighting ESAM again!

3143
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:32,630
It's going to happen eventually.

3144
01:54:32,630 --> 01:54:33,230
Go!

3145
01:54:33,570 --> 01:54:36,510
There's only so long you can go without fucking losing, dude.

3146
01:54:36,690 --> 01:54:37,590
I'm waiting for it.

3147
01:54:38,990 --> 01:54:41,030
Like I don't think it's going to be a big deal.

3148
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:42,270
I don't care about it.

3149
01:54:42,310 --> 01:54:43,890
I think it's going to happen against FD.

3150
01:54:44,050 --> 01:54:45,810
You guys saw that fucking lag, dude.

3151
01:54:46,230 --> 01:54:47,070
Oh yeah, yeah.

3152
01:54:48,010 --> 01:54:49,390
Yeah, I was going to lag against him.

3153
01:54:49,710 --> 01:54:52,230
I think it might be like a console issue or something.

3154
01:54:53,490 --> 01:54:53,850
Alright.

3155
01:54:54,970 --> 01:54:56,030
Like... that shit.

3156
01:54:57,810 --> 01:54:58,490
Oh my god!

3157
01:54:58,710 --> 01:54:59,990
Oh my god, how did I fuck that up?

3158
01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:01,190
How did I fuck that up?

3159
01:55:01,230 --> 01:55:02,610
How did I fuck that up?

3160
01:55:02,730 --> 01:55:03,710
Of course it's me.

3161
01:55:03,870 --> 01:55:05,690
Of course that's how I fuck it up.

3162
01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:06,690
Leave me alone!

3163
01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:11,290
Oh my god.

3164
01:55:11,930 --> 01:55:12,530
Please!

3165
01:55:13,290 --> 01:55:14,770
I just fought...

3166
01:55:14,770 --> 01:55:17,310
I just fought ESAM.

3167
01:55:17,390 --> 01:55:17,990
Get out!

3168
01:55:18,990 --> 01:55:20,030
Get out!

3169
01:55:20,030 --> 01:55:20,210
Get out!

3170
01:55:21,230 --> 01:55:21,670
Get out!

3171
01:55:22,150 --> 01:55:25,150
Get out!

3172
01:55:27,110 --> 01:55:28,290
Oh my god.

3173
01:55:28,330 --> 01:55:29,390
Get the fuck out of here.

3174
01:55:30,290 --> 01:55:31,170
Oh my god.

3175
01:55:31,170 --> 01:55:31,170
Get the fuck out of here.

3176
01:55:33,190 --> 01:55:34,510
I almost had it.

3177
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:36,010
I did not almost had it.

3178
01:55:36,010 --> 01:55:36,550
You know that.

3179
01:55:40,590 --> 01:55:41,830
It's going to be hard.

3180
01:55:41,970 --> 01:55:42,150
No!

3181
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:43,790
I don't want it to be harder!

3182
01:55:44,030 --> 01:55:45,490
I want to get it easily!

3183
01:55:46,730 --> 01:55:47,610
No epic!

3184
01:55:47,970 --> 01:55:48,330
No epic!

3185
01:55:50,030 --> 01:55:51,150
I got three games from blue.

3186
01:55:51,890 --> 01:55:53,350
Oh you... Did you promote?

3187
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:54,610
I'm close.

3188
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:56,650
I'm halfway to purple.

3189
01:55:56,910 --> 01:55:59,210
If I could get blue before Sunday, I... you know.

3190
01:55:59,310 --> 01:56:00,270
That would feel nice.

3191
01:56:00,490 --> 01:56:02,790
I feel like you might as well just fucking strive for it.

3192
01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:03,050
That's easy.

3193
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:06,970
Leave me alone!

3194
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:08,210
Look at that.

3195
01:56:08,290 --> 01:56:09,210
You want to learn how to play Tekken?

3196
01:56:09,290 --> 01:56:10,010
You better play Tekken.

3197
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:13,910
Please!

3198
01:56:14,530 --> 01:56:16,290
Leave me alone, please!

3199
01:56:16,290 --> 01:56:19,610
I have to fight ESAM!

3200
01:56:19,870 --> 01:56:20,830
Please leave me alone!

3201
01:56:21,650 --> 01:56:27,930
Please leave me alone!

3202
01:56:28,110 --> 01:56:29,610
This is not fair.

3203
01:56:31,590 --> 01:56:33,210
This is actually not fair.

3204
01:56:34,770 --> 01:56:36,750
Bro, what the fuck are we doing here?

3205
01:56:40,870 --> 01:56:42,070
Mental shattered!

3206
01:56:42,570 --> 01:56:43,030
No!

3207
01:56:43,450 --> 01:56:46,190
I was waiting for blood to fight him!

3208
01:56:49,750 --> 01:56:50,470
No!

3209
01:56:50,650 --> 01:56:52,070
What did he do to me?

3210
01:56:52,510 --> 01:56:54,590
What did he do to me?

3211
01:56:55,170 --> 01:56:59,450
What did he do to me?

3212
01:56:59,450 --> 01:57:00,590
Mental boomed.

3213
01:57:00,590 --> 01:57:02,370
He boomed the mental.

3214
01:57:02,450 --> 01:57:02,850
How?

3215
01:57:03,270 --> 01:57:05,030
How is this possible?

3216
01:57:07,690 --> 01:57:11,690
He just went free in my head.

3217
01:57:14,370 --> 01:57:15,330
Here we go.

3218
01:57:15,550 --> 01:57:16,270
I'm going to kill you.

3219
01:57:16,290 --> 01:57:16,930
Oh god.

3220
01:57:17,450 --> 01:57:18,250
Not a go.

3221
01:57:21,710 --> 01:57:22,230
There we go.

3222
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:22,910
That should hit, right?

3223
01:57:23,230 --> 01:57:23,630
No!

3224
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:25,330
How did that not hit?

3225
01:57:29,070 --> 01:57:29,630
There we go.

3226
01:57:30,030 --> 01:57:30,990
That should hit.

3227
01:57:32,830 --> 01:57:34,050
The ESAM curse.

3228
01:57:36,530 --> 01:57:37,070
Hey bro.

3229
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:38,470
What's up?

3230
01:57:39,550 --> 01:57:41,890
I laughed at it before, but I honestly haven't done it.

3231
01:57:41,970 --> 01:57:44,910
I know that Oxy can literally let go of the rage art midway.

3232
01:57:44,910 --> 01:57:46,790
So it's not really a good sidewalk hit.

3233
01:57:46,990 --> 01:57:49,350
But if you are going to step it, is it left or right?

3234
01:57:50,270 --> 01:57:51,090
Bro, fuck off.

3235
01:57:51,150 --> 01:57:51,450
Pretty sure.

3236
01:57:54,430 --> 01:57:56,350
It's best to side step and then block.

3237
01:57:57,150 --> 01:57:59,230
So in case he does level 2, you can still launch that.

3238
01:57:59,630 --> 01:58:00,150
Yeah, yeah.

3239
01:58:00,390 --> 01:58:00,790
Fight!

3240
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:05,190
Okay, this is the other combo.

3241
01:58:05,550 --> 01:58:07,410
He delayed getting up!

3242
01:58:08,230 --> 01:58:09,630
That my thing didn't even hit.

3243
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:10,270
That's crazy.

3244
01:58:10,530 --> 01:58:11,170
That's actually crazy.

3245
01:58:11,290 --> 01:58:11,930
I didn't expect that.

3246
01:58:12,730 --> 01:58:13,370
Holy shit.

3247
01:58:15,030 --> 01:58:15,730
Is he going to duck?

3248
01:58:15,870 --> 01:58:16,150
No.

3249
01:58:16,630 --> 01:58:17,370
He didn't duck.

3250
01:58:17,390 --> 01:58:17,730
Thank god.

3251
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:20,290
Oh thank god he didn't duck either.

3252
01:58:24,090 --> 01:58:26,230
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

3253
01:58:27,290 --> 01:58:27,830
Oh no.

3254
01:58:27,930 --> 01:58:28,870
Did I get up from that?

3255
01:58:29,890 --> 01:58:30,530
He missed!

3256
01:58:32,550 --> 01:58:32,870
Yes!

3257
01:58:34,790 --> 01:58:35,950
Okay, not intentional.

3258
01:58:38,130 --> 01:58:39,390
Wait, did I not get that point?

3259
01:58:40,230 --> 01:58:41,250
Did he unplug before?

3260
01:58:41,930 --> 01:58:42,350
Oh, okay.

3261
01:58:42,510 --> 01:58:43,110
Yeah!

3262
01:58:48,370 --> 01:58:52,370
I did not intentionally save that.

3263
01:58:52,650 --> 01:58:53,230
Oh!

3264
01:58:55,310 --> 01:58:56,650
But I'll take it.

3265
01:58:56,810 --> 01:58:57,870
I'll take it.

3266
01:59:00,410 --> 01:59:01,870
Oh thank god.

3267
01:59:03,570 --> 01:59:05,290
How did you do the forbidden?

3268
01:59:05,570 --> 01:59:06,450
I did the forbidden!

3269
01:59:06,630 --> 01:59:08,270
I didn't know I did it!

3270
01:59:08,550 --> 01:59:10,530
It's called button mashing.

3271
01:59:11,070 --> 01:59:11,910
I gotta stop.

3272
01:59:11,930 --> 01:59:12,530
Notification.

3273
01:59:13,230 --> 01:59:15,470
Get ready for the next battle!

3274
01:59:17,290 --> 01:59:19,570
Thank god for button mashing!

3275
01:59:21,310 --> 01:59:21,950
Uhhhh...

3276
01:59:21,950 --> 01:59:23,070
Did he actually play?

3277
01:59:23,690 --> 01:59:25,270
Yeah, I don't think it's up yet.

3278
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:26,550
Oh, yep.

3279
01:59:26,630 --> 01:59:27,050
Bobby's up.

3280
01:59:27,910 --> 01:59:28,550
No!

3281
01:59:29,630 --> 01:59:30,790
I just got in a game!

3282
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:34,010
Okay, I'll finish this rank match quick.

3283
01:59:34,390 --> 01:59:35,930
As in I'll lose really quick.

3284
01:59:36,310 --> 01:59:37,450
Round one.

3285
01:59:38,330 --> 01:59:38,970
Fight!

3286
01:59:41,170 --> 01:59:42,390
Alright, come on!

3287
01:59:43,450 --> 01:59:44,050
Yeah!

3288
01:59:45,030 --> 01:59:45,630
Boom!

3289
01:59:45,630 --> 01:59:46,190
Boom!

3290
01:59:46,850 --> 01:59:47,450
Yeah!

3291
01:59:49,030 --> 01:59:50,130
Please let me win!

3292
01:59:50,350 --> 01:59:50,810
No!

3293
01:59:51,090 --> 01:59:51,690
Please!

3294
01:59:54,190 --> 01:59:54,790
Yes!

3295
01:59:56,410 --> 01:59:57,010
Okay.

3296
01:59:57,510 --> 01:59:58,690
When did this happen?

3297
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:02,850
When did my neighbor get a drum sack?

3298
02:00:03,150 --> 02:00:03,570
What?

3299
02:00:05,350 --> 02:00:07,290
You're like, oh this is gonna be fun.

3300
02:00:07,530 --> 02:00:08,610
Moving forward.

3301
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:08,950
Yeah.

3302
02:00:08,970 --> 02:00:11,430
Oh no no no no no no no no no.

3303
02:00:11,810 --> 02:00:12,430
He got his...

3304
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:12,650
Oh sorry.

3305
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:14,450
Sorry I had my mic on.

3306
02:00:16,310 --> 02:00:17,070
Oh, it's cool.

3307
02:00:17,190 --> 02:00:17,350
It's fun.

3308
02:00:19,250 --> 02:00:19,730
No!

3309
02:00:20,610 --> 02:00:21,090
Ahhh!

3310
02:00:21,870 --> 02:00:22,350
Okay.

3311
02:00:25,090 --> 02:00:25,850
Let's join.

3312
02:00:27,590 --> 02:00:28,070
No.

3313
02:00:29,610 --> 02:00:30,750
I'll be in in one second.

3314
02:00:33,510 --> 02:00:34,330
Oh my god.

3315
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:35,070
He fucked up.

3316
02:00:35,150 --> 02:00:35,930
He fucked me up.

3317
02:00:35,930 --> 02:00:37,930
It's okay, I didn't want to be red anyway.

3318
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:41,930
I didn't want to be red anyway, guys.

3319
02:00:43,110 --> 02:00:44,590
Oh my god.

3320
02:00:47,770 --> 02:00:49,230
Wait, he predicted that?

3321
02:00:49,430 --> 02:00:49,890
How?

3322
02:00:52,550 --> 02:00:54,070
How did he predict that?

3323
02:00:55,230 --> 02:00:56,850
My job is to beat Zhang Wei.

3324
02:00:59,370 --> 02:01:00,070
Let's go team.

3325
02:01:00,410 --> 02:01:01,810
I believe in all of you.

3326
02:01:04,810 --> 02:01:05,710
Oh my god.

3327
02:01:05,870 --> 02:01:06,850
Yeah, I'm not playing that well.

3328
02:01:07,350 --> 02:01:08,170
Don't worry about it.

3329
02:01:08,170 --> 02:01:09,070
It's okay, we lock in.

3330
02:01:09,210 --> 02:01:09,470
It's okay.

3331
02:01:09,670 --> 02:01:11,970
We all lock in.

3332
02:01:15,510 --> 02:01:16,530
Don't worry about it, man.

3333
02:01:16,670 --> 02:01:17,270
It's not even a start.

3334
02:01:18,710 --> 02:01:19,890
I'm rekt to raid!

3335
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:21,690
Okay, I'm going in.

3336
02:01:22,130 --> 02:01:22,830
Let's go.

3337
02:01:22,850 --> 02:01:23,510
I'm rekt though!

3338
02:01:24,490 --> 02:01:25,890
Welcome, best fucking go.

3339
02:01:26,030 --> 02:01:26,730
I mean...

3340
02:01:26,730 --> 02:01:27,450
Best fucking go.

3341
02:01:27,550 --> 02:01:28,350
Goodbye, sir.

3342
02:01:29,710 --> 02:01:30,990
I'm locked in.

3343
02:01:31,810 --> 02:01:32,450
I got red.

3344
02:01:36,030 --> 02:01:36,550
Alright.

3345
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:38,570
Where is the link?

3346
02:01:39,150 --> 02:01:40,610
I fucking had it.

3347
02:01:40,670 --> 02:01:41,070
Alright.

3348
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:41,830
I had a crab.

3349
02:01:42,730 --> 02:01:45,350
It's fine if I lose or win.

3350
02:01:45,670 --> 02:01:46,770
I have red rings.

3351
02:01:46,770 --> 02:01:47,070
Don't worry, bp.

3352
02:01:47,130 --> 02:01:48,030
Honestly, like me too.

3353
02:01:48,090 --> 02:01:49,170
I feel like I'm playing like weird.

3354
02:01:50,810 --> 02:01:52,010
So, it's not even split.

3355
02:01:52,990 --> 02:01:53,810
Alright, guys.

3356
02:01:54,010 --> 02:01:56,750
For once in my life, I'll hide the passcode.

3357
02:01:57,470 --> 02:01:58,510
Holy shit.

3358
02:01:58,570 --> 02:02:00,210
I'm gonna do it, guys.

3359
02:02:01,870 --> 02:02:04,510
Doki, she's not even ranked that much higher than you, to be honest.

3360
02:02:05,450 --> 02:02:06,130
Very winnable.

3361
02:02:06,390 --> 02:02:10,490
Yeah, but I feel like she actually knows what she's doing because she played this game much longer.

3362
02:02:13,030 --> 02:02:15,930
I feel like she knows more than seven moves.

3363
02:02:21,990 --> 02:02:22,730
Alright, guys.

3364
02:02:22,810 --> 02:02:24,850
You can't blame me if somebody joins this lobby.

3365
02:02:24,930 --> 02:02:26,570
I actually hid the code.

3366
02:02:28,430 --> 02:02:30,270
It's not me this time.

3367
02:02:30,290 --> 02:02:30,670
Oh, you did?

3368
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:33,170
I'm not putting in that much effort.

3369
02:02:33,210 --> 02:02:33,690
I'll say it.

3370
02:02:35,930 --> 02:02:36,930
I gave up.

3371
02:02:37,610 --> 02:02:38,530
Sajam has a toupee.

3372
02:02:38,710 --> 02:02:40,230
Like, the whole world's upside down.

3373
02:02:41,930 --> 02:02:43,750
What are these rumors, Slime?

3374
02:02:43,950 --> 02:02:44,850
It's not a rumor.

3375
02:02:44,930 --> 02:02:46,250
Everyone in the FGC knows this.

3376
02:02:47,550 --> 02:02:48,230
Knows what?

3377
02:02:48,790 --> 02:02:50,150
That Sajam has a toupee.

3378
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:51,250
Really?

3379
02:02:51,710 --> 02:02:52,150
Yeah.

3380
02:02:52,170 --> 02:02:52,710
Yeah, it's real.

3381
02:02:52,830 --> 02:02:53,930
He's like Hitman bald.

3382
02:02:54,210 --> 02:02:54,830
Oh my god.

3383
02:02:54,870 --> 02:02:55,330
Why does he?

3384
02:02:55,330 --> 02:02:55,870
Why does he?

3385
02:02:55,890 --> 02:02:56,690
He values his hair so much.

3386
02:02:56,810 --> 02:02:57,310
I know.

3387
02:02:57,490 --> 02:02:58,370
Why does he care?

3388
02:02:59,310 --> 02:02:59,750
I...

3389
02:02:59,750 --> 02:03:01,470
If you're bald, you're smarter.

3390
02:03:02,010 --> 02:03:03,370
Because you mold so much.

3391
02:03:05,810 --> 02:03:06,750
That's what I'm saying.

3392
02:03:07,130 --> 02:03:07,330
Yeah.

3393
02:03:07,390 --> 02:03:08,370
Extra brain space, man.

3394
02:03:09,910 --> 02:03:13,670
His chat was probably making fun of him for being bald, so he went and got a toupee.

3395
02:03:14,330 --> 02:03:15,550
What do you think about the wolf?

3396
02:03:18,390 --> 02:03:18,990
It's good.

3397
02:03:19,050 --> 02:03:20,530
Didn't even rub it for good luck.

3398
02:03:21,310 --> 02:03:21,930
What do you think?

3399
02:03:21,970 --> 02:03:23,290
Avatar Aang is the goat, man.

3400
02:03:23,510 --> 02:03:23,910
Exactly.

3401
02:03:24,390 --> 02:03:25,810
He'd be crazy if I didn't care.

3402
02:03:28,470 --> 02:03:31,550
Bro, he's wearing a toupee because he's hiding his power.

3403
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:32,910
That's why he's not a pro player.

3404
02:03:33,070 --> 02:03:33,350
I don't know.

3405
02:03:34,670 --> 02:03:37,050
That's the broccoli weight.

3406
02:03:37,250 --> 02:03:37,770
The toupee.

3407
02:03:37,990 --> 02:03:39,330
He can't be a pro.

3408
02:03:39,370 --> 02:03:41,070
He's not... He doesn't commit.

3409
02:03:45,250 --> 02:03:45,930
Oh man.

3410
02:03:49,090 --> 02:03:49,770
No wonder.

3411
02:03:49,810 --> 02:03:50,770
E-Sam is so good.

3412
02:03:51,010 --> 02:03:51,090
Yeah.

3413
02:03:51,090 --> 02:03:51,790
Oh my god.

3414
02:03:51,810 --> 02:03:53,430
No wonder he's so good because he's bald.

3415
02:03:55,150 --> 02:03:56,030
It's true.

3416
02:03:57,690 --> 02:03:58,170
Yeah.

3417
02:03:58,270 --> 02:04:00,130
E-Sam does get the weird bald buff.

3418
02:04:00,410 --> 02:04:00,830
Yeah.

3419
02:04:00,830 --> 02:04:02,710
I'm the best in the world at this.

3420
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:10,860
What are we... what are we waiting for?

3421
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:12,260
Y'all can go ahead and start?

3422
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:12,740
Okay.

3423
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:13,480
Fight!

3424
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:15,280
Let me in!

3425
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:17,960
SK is... SK is... oh we were waiting for...

3426
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:18,580
Oh we were waiting, okay.

3427
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:19,100
Oh he woke up, look.

3428
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:19,880
He woke up.

3429
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:22,260
I was like, who are we waiting for?

3430
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:24,760
Finally, I can show the screen!

3431
02:04:25,620 --> 02:04:26,080
Let's go!

3432
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:28,000
You can't yell at me guys!

3433
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:31,100
If somebody joins the lobby...

3434
02:04:35,540 --> 02:04:37,460
Okay, but I hate playing as Rina though.

3435
02:04:37,940 --> 02:04:38,860
She's so fast.

3436
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:41,340
She's so fucking fast.

3437
02:04:42,460 --> 02:04:43,380
I'm too bulky.

3438
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:49,100
Just two reds duking it out.

3439
02:04:49,420 --> 02:04:50,740
That's what you love to see.

3440
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:52,040
Honest red gaming.

3441
02:04:52,300 --> 02:04:53,600
This is true tech.

3442
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:55,120
I proof forced this, right?

3443
02:04:57,480 --> 02:04:59,200
This is what I'm here for.

3444
02:05:01,820 --> 02:05:04,700
Wait, what was her weak... I don't remember what her weakness was.

3445
02:05:04,940 --> 02:05:05,360
Coach, you're the only one who knows.

3446
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:06,000
You didn't tell me.

3447
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:11,820
Coach, what do I do?

3448
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:15,120
Run your shit!

3449
02:05:15,180 --> 02:05:15,760
Are we not talking about SK?

3450
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:16,840
No, we didn't!

3451
02:05:17,020 --> 02:05:17,840
We never talked about SK!

3452
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:19,720
Run your shit!

3453
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:21,300
Let's go!

3454
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:23,660
What do I do, coach?

3455
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:24,340
That's your shit!

3456
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:25,640
Wait, who's...

3457
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:25,980
Right there, that!

3458
02:05:26,140 --> 02:05:26,760
Just do that!

3459
02:05:27,020 --> 02:05:27,800
Do what?

3460
02:05:28,620 --> 02:05:29,100
That!

3461
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:29,780
That!

3462
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:31,000
You're playing it right now!

3463
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:31,560
What's that?

3464
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:31,820
This?

3465
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:32,680
What are you doing?

3466
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:33,980
Yup!

3467
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:35,280
It's literally just happening.

3468
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:36,920
It just happened.

3469
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:37,920
You just did all of it.

3470
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,420
I did that!

3471
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:39,080
I did that!

3472
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:39,740
Fight!

3473
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:41,320
Holy shit.

3474
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:42,580
Oh my god, I did that!

3475
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:43,740
Did you see that, coach?

3476
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:44,840
Yeah, that was incredible.

3477
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:45,420
Did she duck though?

3478
02:05:47,700 --> 02:05:48,140
Yeah, that was incredible.

3479
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:50,700
Okay, I think she knows now.

3480
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:52,740
She knows now, I feel like.

3481
02:05:53,740 --> 02:05:54,920
Time to use that mid.

3482
02:05:55,540 --> 02:05:56,720
Yup, time to hit the...

3483
02:05:56,720 --> 02:05:57,900
Oh wait, the square.

3484
02:05:58,620 --> 02:05:59,820
Yeah, when you're in the sprint.

3485
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:00,120
Square.

3486
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:01,700
It's okay.

3487
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:03,120
It's time.

3488
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:04,060
Oh my god.

3489
02:06:04,060 --> 02:06:04,680
There's no...

3490
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:05,140
Oh my god.

3491
02:06:05,140 --> 02:06:05,920
No fucking way.

3492
02:06:05,940 --> 02:06:07,220
No fucking way.

3493
02:06:08,740 --> 02:06:09,260
No fucking way.

3494
02:06:09,260 --> 02:06:10,840
We're not pressing down one time?

3495
02:06:11,380 --> 02:06:12,620
Not even once, huh?

3496
02:06:13,660 --> 02:06:14,520
What do you mean?

3497
02:06:14,860 --> 02:06:15,560
I told you, it's time.

3498
02:06:15,560 --> 02:06:17,600
Is there some kind of mental block against Doki Bird?

3499
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:19,960
No one ever expects it!

3500
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:22,980
Wait, she actually...

3501
02:06:22,980 --> 02:06:24,640
Oh, she's mixing it up.

3502
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:25,860
Yeah, she's mixing it up.

3503
02:06:26,020 --> 02:06:27,360
Wow, smart player.

3504
02:06:28,140 --> 02:06:29,140
There's no way.

3505
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:29,840
No!

3506
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:32,380
What is this Doki Bird mental block?

3507
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:34,000
I don't know, they never...

3508
02:06:34,940 --> 02:06:38,060
It's weird because they get it and then they lose it.

3509
02:06:38,120 --> 02:06:39,800
Yeah, I don't understand either.

3510
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:41,820
I don't understand why they don't.

3511
02:06:42,020 --> 02:06:42,340
Oh my god, what are they doing?

3512
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:46,780
Okay, both you and the slime and Kumi need to learn...

3513
02:06:46,780 --> 02:06:48,980
Take a book out of fucking Doki's face.

3514
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:49,980
I know, right?

3515
02:06:50,060 --> 02:06:51,140
Rip that shit.

3516
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:52,920
Rip that shit.

3517
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:52,980
Rip that shit.

3518
02:06:52,980 --> 02:06:53,480
Rip that shit.

3519
02:06:53,500 --> 02:06:54,920
Alright, let's finish this.

3520
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:55,960
Oh, she talked!

3521
02:06:56,080 --> 02:06:56,660
She talked!

3522
02:06:57,380 --> 02:06:58,420
Nice try, nice try.

3523
02:06:58,740 --> 02:06:59,260
Nice try.

3524
02:06:59,340 --> 02:06:59,580
Nice try.

3525
02:06:59,780 --> 02:07:00,940
Nice try.

3526
02:07:00,940 --> 02:07:01,180
Fight!

3527
02:07:01,900 --> 02:07:01,960
Fight!

3528
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:02,260
Fight!

3529
02:07:02,260 --> 02:07:02,560
Fight!

3530
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:03,000
Fight!

3531
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:03,940
Fight!

3532
02:07:03,940 --> 02:07:05,120
Oh, she's just like...

3533
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:07,440
Okay, I was trying to, but then like...

3534
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:07,720
Oh, fuck!

3535
02:07:08,710 --> 02:07:12,000
I tried to, but like I pressed square.

3536
02:07:13,740 --> 02:07:14,440
Okay.

3537
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:15,960
Yes!

3538
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:16,740
Oh god.

3539
02:07:17,260 --> 02:07:17,960
Yes!

3540
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:22,120
Oh, no, I couldn't...

3541
02:07:22,770 --> 02:07:24,220
Nice rage art.

3542
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:25,720
No, she got it!

3543
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:27,560
Oh, it's too strong.

3544
02:07:28,180 --> 02:07:30,020
Oh, the misery.

3545
02:07:33,940 --> 02:07:34,640
Wait, what?

3546
02:07:35,460 --> 02:07:36,620
Oh, good play.

3547
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:40,800
Oh my god, I hate that move though in rank.

3548
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:45,020
Oh, what?

3549
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:45,440
Okay.

3550
02:07:47,740 --> 02:07:48,220
Hey.

3551
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:49,200
Nice.

3552
02:07:50,180 --> 02:07:50,660
Okay.

3553
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:51,780
Okay.

3554
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:54,680
Okay.

3555
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:56,600
I got it!

3556
02:07:57,340 --> 02:07:58,420
I got a set!

3557
02:07:58,520 --> 02:07:59,060
I got a set!

3558
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:01,880
Let's go!

3559
02:08:02,580 --> 02:08:03,800
I did it!

3560
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:05,920
Oh, that was close.

3561
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:07,140
Good job, that was close.

3562
02:08:07,460 --> 02:08:11,700
25 hours Joki versus 100 hour Reina!

3563
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:12,880
Who will win?

3564
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:14,860
SK's definitely at 125 now.

3565
02:08:15,980 --> 02:08:18,060
Coffee baby versus Bob.

3566
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:19,800
Yeah, I just did that.

3567
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:20,260
Yeah!

3568
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,640
Didn't your match hit the bell?

3569
02:08:24,620 --> 02:08:25,740
Oh my god.

3570
02:08:27,240 --> 02:08:27,980
It's okay.

3571
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:28,800
Nice.

3572
02:08:28,820 --> 02:08:30,280
You said you're five times better.

3573
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:34,280
You don't want to see Doki Bird at 125 hours.

3574
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:36,320
Yeah, you don't want to see 100...

3575
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:38,800
I don't think I have the hours for that either.

3576
02:08:39,020 --> 02:08:39,960
To be fair.

3577
02:08:40,860 --> 02:08:41,300
Suplex?

3578
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:42,180
Okay.

3579
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:43,440
No way.

3580
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:46,820
I like how you didn't hop kick either.

3581
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:48,280
Yeah, that was good.

3582
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:50,580
Oh my god, dude.

3583
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:56,120
Guys, I feel like they're gonna learn this by the finals though.

3584
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:57,500
It's looking like a pretty good move, bro.

3585
02:08:58,260 --> 02:09:01,240
I mean, I'm just saying, like, that was pretty good.

3586
02:09:02,260 --> 02:09:03,460
Oh my god.

3587
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:06,280
Dude, that's so not good actually.

3588
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:07,440
Dude, she's fucking swagging.

3589
02:09:07,900 --> 02:09:08,440
This is crazy.

3590
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:10,500
Oh my god.

3591
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:12,040
That's the new strength.

3592
02:09:12,120 --> 02:09:13,040
It's only correct decisions.

3593
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:17,600
How did she keep getting away with this?

3594
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:18,380
It's like God of War, she's buying new moves.

3595
02:09:19,740 --> 02:09:21,040
Like, Devil May Cry.

3596
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:24,700
How did she keep getting away?

3597
02:09:25,260 --> 02:09:26,340
Oh, big dunk.

3598
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:28,000
Oh no.

3599
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:28,860
I don't know.

3600
02:09:28,860 --> 02:09:31,920
She like, fucking mixes it up, so it's hard.

3601
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:33,100
Nice.

3602
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:34,300
Oh no.

3603
02:09:36,980 --> 02:09:37,520
Goodbye.

3604
02:09:40,060 --> 02:09:41,180
She hits it.

3605
02:09:41,580 --> 02:09:42,380
Oh no!

3606
02:09:44,620 --> 02:09:45,200
That's fine.

3607
02:09:45,260 --> 02:09:48,900
She had to use lightning herself to kill you.

3608
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:49,700
Just to be clear.

3609
02:09:49,880 --> 02:09:51,020
We start off with that.

3610
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:54,740
Round start.

3611
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:55,520
Alley kick.

3612
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,420
You're about to get King's worst low nerfed.

3613
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:03,100
Just because of what I do?

3614
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:04,360
That's just because of Harada.

3615
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:07,240
Harada's watching, I guarantee you right now.

3616
02:10:07,420 --> 02:10:08,160
Oh my god.

3617
02:10:08,280 --> 02:10:08,820
Oh my god.

3618
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:11,160
Do you think that was intentional for her?

3619
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:12,780
That shit went like a movie.

3620
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:14,660
Yeah, holy shit.

3621
02:10:15,580 --> 02:10:18,260
Okay, when you pop heat, hold onto your heat smash.

3622
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:19,980
Don't pop it right away because she's blocking it.

3623
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:20,340
Oh, okay.

3624
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:21,080
Okay.

3625
02:10:26,070 --> 02:10:26,830
Oh shit.

3626
02:10:27,270 --> 02:10:28,990
Oh, I think she actually is learning.

3627
02:10:30,890 --> 02:10:32,010
Yeah, that was a good adaptation.

3628
02:10:32,290 --> 02:10:33,110
We're still live.

3629
02:10:33,350 --> 02:10:34,450
Oh my gosh.

3630
02:10:34,990 --> 02:10:35,310
Boom.

3631
02:10:36,190 --> 02:10:38,390
Do I do square or grab?

3632
02:10:39,470 --> 02:10:40,430
You run up grab.

3633
02:10:40,730 --> 02:10:41,070
Okay.

3634
02:10:43,950 --> 02:10:45,630
Wait till she gets up though.

3635
02:10:45,690 --> 02:10:46,350
Wait till she gets up.

3636
02:10:46,450 --> 02:10:48,090
Because sometimes they like to stay on the ground.

3637
02:10:48,570 --> 02:10:49,070
There you go.

3638
02:10:49,350 --> 02:10:50,570
I pop heat.

3639
02:10:52,950 --> 02:10:54,110
And go mid.

3640
02:10:54,990 --> 02:10:55,630
Square, square.

3641
02:10:57,270 --> 02:10:57,830
Bad read Matt!

3642
02:10:58,930 --> 02:11:00,030
Oh nice try, nice try.

3643
02:11:00,230 --> 02:11:00,710
Bad read!

3644
02:11:01,810 --> 02:11:04,850
A plan is better than no plan at all.

3645
02:11:04,910 --> 02:11:05,330
It's Matt's fault.

3646
02:11:05,590 --> 02:11:06,550
It's Matt's fault.

3647
02:11:08,390 --> 02:11:10,410
Yeah, you blew it for us.

3648
02:11:10,590 --> 02:11:12,210
I can only be right so many times, I'm sorry.

3649
02:11:15,590 --> 02:11:16,610
The wrong read.

3650
02:11:16,650 --> 02:11:18,070
Okay, do that running grab a lot.

3651
02:11:19,070 --> 02:11:20,390
She has not picked a single one.

3652
02:11:21,770 --> 02:11:22,810
And then she's gonna...

3653
02:11:22,810 --> 02:11:24,310
And then she's gonna do a bad read again.

3654
02:11:25,330 --> 02:11:25,690
And then she's gonna do a bad read again.

3655
02:11:27,370 --> 02:11:28,190
Oh my god.

3656
02:11:28,250 --> 02:11:29,050
What the fuck?

3657
02:11:29,070 --> 02:11:30,350
Oh my god.

3658
02:11:30,370 --> 02:11:31,010
She mad.

3659
02:11:31,770 --> 02:11:32,930
She mad now.

3660
02:11:34,730 --> 02:11:36,450
She fucking mad now.

3661
02:11:37,930 --> 02:11:38,870
She's fucking mad.

3662
02:11:41,850 --> 02:11:42,850
Oh my god.

3663
02:11:43,350 --> 02:11:44,310
She's so mad.

3664
02:11:44,750 --> 02:11:45,810
I'm so sorry.

3665
02:11:46,030 --> 02:11:47,030
I'm so sorry.

3666
02:11:47,170 --> 02:11:48,050
She's gonna block this.

3667
02:11:48,090 --> 02:11:51,650
Alright, true, true, true.

3668
02:11:51,950 --> 02:11:52,790
You said it all there.

3669
02:11:54,010 --> 02:11:55,010
Round two.

3670
02:11:55,970 --> 02:11:56,470
Fight!

3671
02:11:57,110 --> 02:11:57,610
Okay.

3672
02:12:00,830 --> 02:12:01,330
Oh.

3673
02:12:03,190 --> 02:12:03,690
Oh.

3674
02:12:03,910 --> 02:12:05,210
I like the idea.

3675
02:12:05,610 --> 02:12:06,550
We're playing Tekken.

3676
02:12:06,810 --> 02:12:08,410
We're playing Tekken, yeah, right here.

3677
02:12:08,490 --> 02:12:09,070
Right now.

3678
02:12:10,810 --> 02:12:12,130
This is Tekken.

3679
02:12:13,750 --> 02:12:14,550
Oh shit.

3680
02:12:14,890 --> 02:12:16,690
Yeah, this is definitely Tekken.

3681
02:12:18,370 --> 02:12:19,510
Nice, I love your patience.

3682
02:12:19,570 --> 02:12:20,090
It's so good.

3683
02:12:23,250 --> 02:12:24,890
I think I need to be more patient, guys.

3684
02:12:28,190 --> 02:12:29,130
Oh, huge.

3685
02:12:29,470 --> 02:12:29,970
No, what?

3686
02:12:31,570 --> 02:12:34,910
No, she actually blocked it.

3687
02:12:35,170 --> 02:12:35,770
It's okay.

3688
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:38,030
And in the end, I got that one set.

3689
02:12:39,630 --> 02:12:40,310
Not over.

3690
02:12:40,590 --> 02:12:41,250
That's true.

3691
02:12:41,810 --> 02:12:42,470
That's true.

3692
02:12:45,870 --> 02:12:46,670
Wait, what?

3693
02:12:46,870 --> 02:12:47,490
What was that?

3694
02:12:48,050 --> 02:12:48,810
I don't know.

3695
02:12:49,190 --> 02:12:51,170
Yeah, that looked fucking freaky though.

3696
02:12:52,790 --> 02:12:53,910
Freaking technique though.

3697
02:12:53,990 --> 02:12:54,650
Not gonna lie.

3698
02:12:54,750 --> 02:12:55,190
Yeah.

3699
02:12:58,930 --> 02:12:59,370
Okay.

3700
02:12:59,790 --> 02:13:01,470
That's a freaky fucking technique.

3701
02:13:02,510 --> 02:13:04,070
Oh fuck, I should have grabbed.

3702
02:13:04,530 --> 02:13:04,970
Nice.

3703
02:13:06,150 --> 02:13:07,110
Guys, it's okay.

3704
02:13:07,190 --> 02:13:08,650
I got us that five points though.

3705
02:13:09,070 --> 02:13:09,210
You got...

3706
02:13:10,410 --> 02:13:12,250
Wait, we get points per game?

3707
02:13:12,630 --> 02:13:13,250
Do we get per set?

3708
02:13:13,470 --> 02:13:13,490
No.

3709
02:13:14,690 --> 02:13:16,470
Oh, we don't this time?

3710
02:13:17,290 --> 02:13:17,730
No!

3711
02:13:17,730 --> 02:13:18,310
No!

3712
02:13:21,250 --> 02:13:21,690
No!

3713
02:13:21,750 --> 02:13:22,950
No, I should have used more alley kicks.

3714
02:13:23,690 --> 02:13:24,750
I blame Matt.

3715
02:13:24,770 --> 02:13:26,990
Alley kicks probably would have made her knees explode.

3716
02:13:27,690 --> 02:13:28,130
True.

3717
02:13:28,430 --> 02:13:31,050
She would have been a smoking pair of shoes in the coliseum.

3718
02:13:31,270 --> 02:13:32,030
So true.

3719
02:13:33,950 --> 02:13:35,390
What's the code for this lobby?

3720
02:13:35,670 --> 02:13:37,430
It doesn't let me spectate, so I restart it.

3721
02:13:37,850 --> 02:13:39,550
How do I say it to you without leaking?

3722
02:13:39,590 --> 02:13:40,850
It's 8921.

3723
02:13:41,310 --> 02:13:42,110
Oh, I guess it doesn't matter yet.

3724
02:13:42,530 --> 02:13:43,990
We did this fucking yesterday.

3725
02:13:44,030 --> 02:13:44,490
I'm so stupid.

3726
02:13:45,210 --> 02:13:45,870
Oh god.

3727
02:13:46,010 --> 02:13:46,830
Right there.

3728
02:13:49,590 --> 02:13:50,210
Who's next?

3729
02:13:50,450 --> 02:13:50,670
Kony.

3730
02:13:50,670 --> 02:13:54,370
He will not play R2.

3731
02:13:54,530 --> 02:13:55,190
Let's go Kony.

3732
02:13:56,010 --> 02:13:58,110
I should have alley kicked more.

3733
02:13:58,390 --> 02:13:59,350
Let's go GOAT.

3734
02:13:59,750 --> 02:14:00,570
Let's go GOAT!

3735
02:14:04,790 --> 02:14:05,690
Come out Kony.

3736
02:14:05,850 --> 02:14:06,550
Bring it back.

3737
02:14:07,530 --> 02:14:08,150
Redeem me.

3738
02:14:10,730 --> 02:14:11,970
Oh, I got a good stage.

3739
02:14:13,070 --> 02:14:14,350
It's the comet.

3740
02:14:14,730 --> 02:14:15,750
Asteroid, whatever it is.

3741
02:14:16,870 --> 02:14:18,430
Floor blast on the third round.

3742
02:14:18,530 --> 02:14:19,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3743
02:14:23,860 --> 02:14:26,480
Yeah, she's always going to start off with that sidestep.

3744
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:27,300
Round one.

3745
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:28,720
Shoulder.

3746
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:30,260
I hate fighting her, Rink.

3747
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:32,600
Yeah, she can be enemy.

3748
02:14:43,230 --> 02:14:43,710
Oh.

3749
02:14:44,110 --> 02:14:44,530
Got it.

3750
02:14:45,790 --> 02:14:46,750
Island Kony.

3751
02:14:47,550 --> 02:14:48,730
Come out Kony.

3752
02:14:50,350 --> 02:14:51,250
The Bahamas.

3753
02:14:51,390 --> 02:14:51,770
Nice!

3754
02:14:54,350 --> 02:14:55,310
Round two.

3755
02:14:55,310 --> 02:14:57,110
The coach didn't teach her that.

3756
02:14:57,850 --> 02:14:59,870
They will by the tournament time.

3757
02:15:00,230 --> 02:15:01,090
Yeah, definitely.

3758
02:15:01,430 --> 02:15:02,630
You think they're using you.

3759
02:15:03,070 --> 02:15:04,750
You're so cute right now.

3760
02:15:05,110 --> 02:15:05,550
Whoa.

3761
02:15:07,050 --> 02:15:08,370
Yeah, I'm just going to abuse that.

3762
02:15:09,250 --> 02:15:10,230
Oh my god.

3763
02:15:12,010 --> 02:15:13,690
That's just our layer one.

3764
02:15:13,850 --> 02:15:14,670
So that's okay.

3765
02:15:14,790 --> 02:15:14,890
Right.

3766
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:25,940
I tried to go the muscle buster.

3767
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:27,460
Yeah, it would have exploded the wall.

3768
02:15:27,820 --> 02:15:28,260
Nice.

3769
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:28,600
I'm going to go the force.

3770
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:31,520
That's what I'm trying to land here.

3771
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:33,480
I don't want to try to force it too much though.

3772
02:15:35,580 --> 02:15:36,320
What the fuck?

3773
02:15:36,440 --> 02:15:37,460
Oh my god, she broke it.

3774
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:38,160
Wow.

3775
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:40,700
Got it.

3776
02:15:40,740 --> 02:15:42,300
It's a pressing button.

3777
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:43,060
That was insane.

3778
02:15:46,240 --> 02:15:46,880
Oh, sorry.

3779
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:48,480
I got it.

3780
02:15:48,500 --> 02:15:48,700
I got it.

3781
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:56,780
If she's smart, she'll switch the techniques.

3782
02:15:58,260 --> 02:15:59,140
Yeah, you can.

3783
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:02,220
I mean, I didn't earlier.

3784
02:16:04,640 --> 02:16:06,780
Has anyone actually swapped a stage?

3785
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:08,380
I don't think so.

3786
02:16:08,680 --> 02:16:10,480
Yeah, I think we're just autopiling on this.

3787
02:16:10,760 --> 02:16:11,460
I would.

3788
02:16:11,620 --> 02:16:13,420
I would just be like, yeah, rematch, go again.

3789
02:16:13,600 --> 02:16:14,820
I lose, I win, alright.

3790
02:16:16,520 --> 02:16:17,760
Alright, Matt, but you didn't.

3791
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:18,440
You never lost.

3792
02:16:18,840 --> 02:16:21,160
I will eventually.

3793
02:16:22,580 --> 02:16:24,220
You don't need to swap stages.

3794
02:16:24,220 --> 02:16:24,900
You don't lose.

3795
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:27,040
Yeah.

3796
02:16:40,070 --> 02:16:40,550
Nice.

3797
02:16:41,850 --> 02:16:42,490
Got it.

3798
02:16:43,190 --> 02:16:43,790
Let's go.

3799
02:16:43,930 --> 02:16:45,950
Down back three, baby, down back three.

3800
02:16:45,990 --> 02:16:47,050
She's just really scared.

3801
02:16:47,930 --> 02:16:48,410
Yeah.

3802
02:16:49,410 --> 02:16:50,390
Oh my god.

3803
02:16:51,730 --> 02:16:53,630
So I can just control pace.

3804
02:16:53,930 --> 02:16:55,510
Oh my goodness.

3805
02:16:55,790 --> 02:16:57,470
I'm gonna do that to Eski in the finals.

3806
02:16:58,050 --> 02:16:58,530
Yup.

3807
02:16:58,930 --> 02:17:00,430
Oh, she doesn't take Drain Swing.

3808
02:17:02,190 --> 02:17:02,670
Oh.

3809
02:17:02,910 --> 02:17:04,170
Oh my god, bro, you're nuts.

3810
02:17:04,170 --> 02:17:04,350
Oh my god, bro, you're nuts.

3811
02:17:07,670 --> 02:17:10,630
If she's struggling to me now, it's Ali kicks.

3812
02:17:10,690 --> 02:17:10,710
If she's struggling to me now, it's Ali kicks.

3813
02:17:10,710 --> 02:17:12,570
It's just like, like she's scrambling to find an opening.

3814
02:17:12,770 --> 02:17:15,710
So if I just swing every time, it's like, I don't know.

3815
02:17:15,710 --> 02:17:16,790
I think her brain scrambled.

3816
02:17:17,190 --> 02:17:18,630
Yeah, there's no boxes going on.

3817
02:17:19,950 --> 02:17:21,990
This matchup's very annoying, so I get it.

3818
02:17:22,090 --> 02:17:22,230
This matchup's very annoying, so I get it.

3819
02:17:22,690 --> 02:17:24,550
Or not the matchup, but I guess King.

3820
02:17:25,670 --> 02:17:26,670
Yeah, King's a nut.

3821
02:17:26,910 --> 02:17:27,010
Yeah, King's a nut.

3822
02:17:27,990 --> 02:17:28,390
Shit.

3823
02:17:31,110 --> 02:17:32,150
She's breaking everything.

3824
02:17:32,150 --> 02:17:32,550
Yeah.

3825
02:17:32,610 --> 02:17:33,710
Yeah, she's breaking.

3826
02:17:33,890 --> 02:17:35,330
A counter hit throws, too.

3827
02:17:35,650 --> 02:17:39,050
Is she mashing or is she actually knowing the tech?

3828
02:17:39,310 --> 02:17:41,390
Well, she's broken both twos and threes.

3829
02:17:41,550 --> 02:17:42,970
Or twos and ones, so.

3830
02:17:43,350 --> 02:17:44,130
And this might be...

3831
02:17:44,130 --> 02:17:44,930
She's on one plus two.

3832
02:17:46,450 --> 02:17:47,330
Nice job.

3833
02:17:47,390 --> 02:17:47,670
Alright.

3834
02:17:49,050 --> 02:17:52,050
It won't be that fee in finals, but I appreciate the points.

3835
02:17:52,750 --> 02:17:53,390
Lightweight, baby.

3836
02:17:53,750 --> 02:17:57,810
Yeah, fee has to teach her that, like, that should not hit.

3837
02:17:57,950 --> 02:17:59,630
Like, just lay down, you know?

3838
02:18:01,090 --> 02:18:01,530
Alright.

3839
02:18:01,610 --> 02:18:02,130
Let me read my first one.

3840
02:18:02,150 --> 02:18:02,450
Alright, fang notes.

3841
02:18:02,950 --> 02:18:03,490
Fang way.

3842
02:18:04,570 --> 02:18:05,950
This guy is good.

3843
02:18:07,130 --> 02:18:08,250
I believe in you.

3844
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:12,540
Oh, wait.

3845
02:18:12,580 --> 02:18:13,200
Was it this guy?

3846
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:14,300
I think it was this guy, right?

3847
02:18:14,540 --> 02:18:15,520
Or am I thinking of Rey?

3848
02:18:18,460 --> 02:18:21,460
Fairlight is the fang who is pretty hard.

3849
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:22,200
Okay.

3850
02:18:22,600 --> 02:18:23,860
We talked about it.

3851
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:28,840
And remember, Slime, he's going to lay down in a lot of okey situations when he liked to do the running one plus two.

3852
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:30,280
So that's a forward forward two.

3853
02:18:30,560 --> 02:18:30,860
Yep.

3854
02:18:33,900 --> 02:18:35,980
Don't start the round with buttons.

3855
02:18:36,380 --> 02:18:38,020
He's always waiting for you.

3856
02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:38,580
Okay.

3857
02:18:40,980 --> 02:18:42,980
Maybe you can start with like a down back two.

3858
02:18:43,640 --> 02:18:44,080
Maybe.

3859
02:18:44,860 --> 02:18:45,920
If you really want.

3860
02:18:46,720 --> 02:18:48,440
And back one plus two.

3861
02:18:48,500 --> 02:18:51,060
Hunting Bear stands one plus two will probably get this guy.

3862
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:53,040
Look at the cause.

3863
02:18:53,740 --> 02:18:54,680
How do I get in there?

3864
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:58,300
Who is unban me brawl co- Who the fuck is that?

3865
02:18:58,460 --> 02:18:59,240
How are they getting in here?

3866
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:00,220
I'm unbanning you.

3867
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:02,120
That's so cringe.

3868
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:02,800
Okay.

3869
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:04,500
That's not from me.

3870
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:06,300
I want you to know that.

3871
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:11,440
You will never be valued from the people that you watch every day ever.

3872
02:19:11,640 --> 02:19:12,260
Oh my god.

3873
02:19:12,800 --> 02:19:13,320
Remember that.

3874
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:18,600
Well we know the leak is not coming from us for sure.

3875
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:20,880
It's coming from inside the Brawl Pro chat.

3876
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:21,320
Yeah.

3877
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:26,400
It's actually our alt accounts by the way.

3878
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:29,400
It's one of us.

3879
02:19:29,980 --> 02:19:33,940
It's one of us.

3880
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:36,780
I like at least he's sitting on the sidelines.

3881
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:38,000
I like at least he's sitting on the sidelines.

3882
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:38,740
Yeah he's not hopping in.

3883
02:19:39,400 --> 02:19:41,140
Holding the lobby hostage.

3884
02:19:41,500 --> 02:19:42,200
He's making a statement.

3885
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:43,020
He's making a statement.

3886
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:46,880
Alright.

3887
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:47,920
Let's do it baby.

3888
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:50,080
Oh that's a new costume.

3889
02:19:50,840 --> 02:19:51,900
Is that the Punisher?

3890
02:19:53,080 --> 02:19:54,620
Oh my god he has a gun.

3891
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:56,820
Maybe he's Jason.

3892
02:19:57,540 --> 02:19:58,560
There's that snake edge.

3893
02:20:03,420 --> 02:20:04,380
Oh this guy is a nerd.

3894
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:17,520
I gotta stop doing that.

3895
02:20:17,720 --> 02:20:18,780
Stop messing it up.

3896
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:23,320
I didn't mean to do that.

3897
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:24,280
Nice job.

3898
02:20:26,340 --> 02:20:27,140
Way careful.

3899
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:28,660
Alright time to mix it.

3900
02:20:28,720 --> 02:20:29,340
Time to mix it.

3901
02:20:32,820 --> 02:20:33,480
I waited.

3902
02:20:34,840 --> 02:20:35,240
I waited.

3903
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:36,320
I waited.

3904
02:20:37,240 --> 02:20:37,680
Deal.

3905
02:20:39,080 --> 02:20:39,520
Deal.

3906
02:20:41,740 --> 02:20:43,040
Oh my god.

3907
02:20:43,640 --> 02:20:43,900
Aww.

3908
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:45,840
Deal.

3909
02:20:47,780 --> 02:20:48,760
What the fuck?

3910
02:20:48,820 --> 02:20:49,900
Where did your HP go?

3911
02:20:55,240 --> 02:20:56,200
I got a two grab.

3912
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:57,900
That's a one or two.

3913
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,380
You could have killed him if you did the wall combo.

3914
02:21:00,100 --> 02:21:00,540
Yeah.

3915
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:01,680
KO.

3916
02:21:06,210 --> 02:21:06,650
Fight.

3917
02:21:07,730 --> 02:21:08,850
Okay we got this.

3918
02:21:09,250 --> 02:21:09,850
Take this.

3919
02:21:15,790 --> 02:21:16,790
Oh my god.

3920
02:21:17,330 --> 02:21:18,010
Oh my god.

3921
02:21:18,010 --> 02:21:18,330
Oh my god.

3922
02:21:19,130 --> 02:21:20,110
There it is.

3923
02:21:20,290 --> 02:21:21,150
There it is.

3924
02:21:21,270 --> 02:21:22,150
I'll get in charge of it.

3925
02:21:23,110 --> 02:21:23,810
That's okay.

3926
02:21:24,070 --> 02:21:24,790
Good shit.

3927
02:21:24,950 --> 02:21:25,290
Nice.

3928
02:21:28,090 --> 02:21:28,630
Yeah.

3929
02:21:28,790 --> 02:21:30,010
Oh jigglet didn't work.

3930
02:21:32,010 --> 02:21:32,550
Fight.

3931
02:21:37,540 --> 02:21:38,080
Jesus.

3932
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:41,540
No.

3933
02:21:43,580 --> 02:21:43,800
No.

3934
02:21:46,700 --> 02:21:47,780
I thought he would do a low.

3935
02:21:47,860 --> 02:21:48,720
He just kept doing the running one.

3936
02:21:48,900 --> 02:21:49,720
Can I step that?

3937
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:51,580
If I know what's coming.

3938
02:21:52,260 --> 02:21:52,660
Yeah.

3939
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:58,080
But if he hits you with it and it knocks you down and then you tech then probably not.

3940
02:21:58,360 --> 02:21:59,940
He just shouldn't do that pose.

3941
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:05,780
When he's TOing I mean if you can react to it and you block that you can twin piston it.

3942
02:22:06,300 --> 02:22:06,700
Okay.

3943
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:07,880
TO is really bad.

3944
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:08,380
That shoulder.

3945
02:22:10,140 --> 02:22:10,940
Round one.

3946
02:22:12,040 --> 02:22:12,440
Fight.

3947
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:21,300
Oh my god.

3948
02:22:21,380 --> 02:22:21,880
Oh my god.

3949
02:22:22,620 --> 02:22:22,640
Oh my god.

3950
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:26,320
Oh my god.

3951
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:26,360
Oh my god.

3952
02:22:26,360 --> 02:22:27,660
Grab the threat and the punting bearer.

3953
02:22:27,700 --> 02:22:28,020
Grab.

3954
02:22:28,260 --> 02:22:28,500
Grab the threat and the punting bearer.

3955
02:22:28,500 --> 02:22:28,500
Grab.

3956
02:22:29,940 --> 02:22:30,500
Oh.

3957
02:22:30,980 --> 02:22:31,420
Oh.

3958
02:22:40,840 --> 02:22:42,120
I'm really tired man.

3959
02:22:42,240 --> 02:22:43,380
I can't fucking...

3960
02:22:44,180 --> 02:22:44,460
Alright.

3961
02:22:44,580 --> 02:22:45,100
Let's play the game.

3962
02:22:45,100 --> 02:22:47,200
He's definitely overwhelming for sure.

3963
02:22:49,720 --> 02:22:51,100
That was sick.

3964
02:22:51,300 --> 02:22:51,440
That was sick.

3965
02:22:56,660 --> 02:22:59,040
You can also... that roll guard break remember?

3966
02:23:08,310 --> 02:23:09,430
No way.

3967
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:23,020
I would definitely rage art him after he does something like that.

3968
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:23,880
Like a heat burst.

3969
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:24,580
Yeah.

3970
02:23:24,660 --> 02:23:25,280
You have it.

3971
02:23:26,180 --> 02:23:27,480
He's mashing every time.

3972
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:29,320
Oops.

3973
02:23:36,090 --> 02:23:36,650
I'm gonna go for the headshot.

3974
02:23:40,070 --> 02:23:40,630
Okay.

3975
02:23:41,730 --> 02:23:42,290
Yeah.

3976
02:23:42,370 --> 02:23:43,510
He's breaking 1 plus 2 every time.

3977
02:23:45,070 --> 02:23:45,630
Oh.

3978
02:23:45,850 --> 02:23:46,410
The punish.

3979
02:23:46,550 --> 02:23:47,010
Oh.

3980
02:23:49,310 --> 02:23:50,630
Oh my god.

3981
02:23:50,890 --> 02:23:51,650
Go slam.

3982
02:23:52,650 --> 02:23:53,670
Not yet.

3983
02:23:53,970 --> 02:23:54,210
Oh.

3984
02:23:54,370 --> 02:23:54,690
Nice.

3985
02:23:54,770 --> 02:23:55,110
Yo.

3986
02:23:55,890 --> 02:23:56,450
Oh.

3987
02:23:56,570 --> 02:23:57,010
Kuma.

3988
02:23:57,330 --> 02:23:58,110
Good dive.

3989
02:23:59,390 --> 02:23:59,950
Fight.

3990
02:24:04,290 --> 02:24:05,430
How did that work?

3991
02:24:06,810 --> 02:24:07,410
Tio.

3992
02:24:11,450 --> 02:24:12,050
Boom.

3993
02:24:12,210 --> 02:24:12,610
Boom.

3994
02:24:12,750 --> 02:24:13,350
Boom.

3995
02:24:13,450 --> 02:24:13,850
Boom.

3996
02:24:14,170 --> 02:24:14,170
Boom.

3997
02:24:14,170 --> 02:24:14,170
Boom.

3998
02:24:14,170 --> 02:24:14,170
Boom.

3999
02:24:14,170 --> 02:24:14,210
Boom.

4000
02:24:14,210 --> 02:24:14,670
Boom.

4001
02:24:14,670 --> 02:24:14,670
Boom.

4002
02:24:14,670 --> 02:24:14,830
Boom.

4003
02:24:15,170 --> 02:24:15,650
Boom.

4004
02:24:15,650 --> 02:24:15,650
Boom.

4005
02:24:15,650 --> 02:24:15,650
Boom.

4006
02:24:15,650 --> 02:24:15,650
Boom.

4007
02:24:15,690 --> 02:24:16,290
Boom.

4008
02:24:16,750 --> 02:24:17,350
Boom.

4009
02:24:17,350 --> 02:24:18,450
Always grabbing from Oki.

4010
02:24:18,770 --> 02:24:21,430
Oh wow.

4011
02:24:22,070 --> 02:24:22,450
Just a tuck in.

4012
02:24:23,570 --> 02:24:25,610
I didn't know he could do another fucking kick.

4013
02:24:27,990 --> 02:24:29,790
What a fucking miserable character.

4014
02:24:29,790 --> 02:24:30,150
What a fucking miserable fucking character.

4015
02:24:30,310 --> 02:24:31,490
He's a strong player.

4016
02:24:31,650 --> 02:24:32,010
Yeah.

4017
02:24:32,210 --> 02:24:33,230
He's good.

4018
02:24:35,430 --> 02:24:35,970
Sounds off of me.

4019
02:24:36,030 --> 02:24:38,210
Like why would you play the character that does that pose?

4020
02:24:39,710 --> 02:24:40,870
For real, bro.

4021
02:24:40,870 --> 02:24:42,210
I was thinking of last match.

4022
02:24:42,470 --> 02:24:43,270
I was thinking that.

4023
02:24:43,330 --> 02:24:44,430
That makes you think.

4024
02:24:44,470 --> 02:24:45,830
Like what are you really about, man?

4025
02:24:45,970 --> 02:24:46,230
Yeah.

4026
02:24:48,150 --> 02:24:49,610
I wasn't gonna say anything.

4027
02:24:49,610 --> 02:24:51,050
But if you're gonna say it...

4028
02:24:53,310 --> 02:24:53,890
That's all.

4029
02:25:02,750 --> 02:25:05,030
Are they updating the points live or...

4030
02:25:05,030 --> 02:25:05,550
Probably not.

4031
02:25:05,650 --> 02:25:05,850
Right?

4032
02:25:06,330 --> 02:25:06,990
Probably not.

4033
02:25:08,730 --> 02:25:09,610
Got you.

4034
02:25:11,310 --> 02:25:13,070
I'm laggy as fuck, Eddy Zafina.

4035
02:25:13,730 --> 02:25:16,490
I'm gonna say it like I'll definitely try but I...

4036
02:25:16,490 --> 02:25:18,230
Like this guy...

4037
02:25:19,210 --> 02:25:21,030
He's playing on a microwave, man.

4038
02:25:21,210 --> 02:25:21,770
I don't know.

4039
02:25:21,910 --> 02:25:22,270
We'll try.

4040
02:25:22,270 --> 02:25:22,530
It's okay.

4041
02:25:22,770 --> 02:25:25,350
If you're lagging, he's lagging.

4042
02:25:25,510 --> 02:25:28,950
This is like literally the most ranked Tekken match I've ever experienced.

4043
02:25:29,290 --> 02:25:31,790
Like, one bar Eddy...

4044
02:25:31,790 --> 02:25:32,330
Jack!

4045
02:25:33,870 --> 02:25:34,990
Oh no!

4046
02:25:35,350 --> 02:25:35,850
Jack!

4047
02:25:36,330 --> 02:25:37,690
He said fuck your character.

4048
02:25:38,230 --> 02:25:38,670
What?

4049
02:25:38,970 --> 02:25:40,830
I saw him in the general last night.

4050
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:42,350
He said this was gonna be a jack off.

4051
02:25:42,790 --> 02:25:43,810
Oh my god.

4052
02:25:43,870 --> 02:25:44,390
I'm not kidding.

4053
02:25:44,510 --> 02:25:45,970
He said he was gonna learn Jack off first.

4054
02:25:46,050 --> 02:25:46,550
Jack off.

4055
02:25:46,630 --> 02:25:46,890
Yes.

4056
02:25:48,610 --> 02:25:49,530
That's what he said.

4057
02:25:49,750 --> 02:25:50,690
Chat, is this real?

4058
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:51,870
Oh my god.

4059
02:25:51,910 --> 02:25:53,430
The Jack mirror?

4060
02:25:54,390 --> 02:25:55,610
Did he give up?

4061
02:25:56,650 --> 02:25:57,090
No.

4062
02:25:57,210 --> 02:25:58,150
He played Jack.

4063
02:25:58,150 --> 02:25:59,030
He's not the undertaker, bro.

4064
02:25:59,850 --> 02:26:00,910
Oh, that is the undertaker.

4065
02:26:01,310 --> 02:26:02,410
Father Gascoigne.

4066
02:26:03,250 --> 02:26:03,690
Bloodborne.

4067
02:26:03,790 --> 02:26:04,790
Whatever his name is.

4068
02:26:05,750 --> 02:26:06,190
Oh my god.

4069
02:26:07,690 --> 02:26:08,050
Oh my god.

4070
02:26:11,070 --> 02:26:12,290
That's fucking right.

4071
02:26:13,790 --> 02:26:15,010
A Jack off.

4072
02:26:15,950 --> 02:26:17,110
Okay, don't do that.

4073
02:26:19,410 --> 02:26:19,890
Understood.

4074
02:26:20,690 --> 02:26:22,110
He's gone out there jacking off.

4075
02:26:25,150 --> 02:26:26,050
He's jacking it?

4076
02:26:26,130 --> 02:26:26,710
He's jacking it?

4077
02:26:27,270 --> 02:26:29,350
Wait, what do you guys mean by that?

4078
02:26:30,130 --> 02:26:30,610
What?

4079
02:26:30,690 --> 02:26:31,230
It's when you...

4080
02:26:31,230 --> 02:26:32,390
Yeah, who?

4081
02:26:33,670 --> 02:26:35,890
You know, in the race of Jacks.

4082
02:26:36,890 --> 02:26:37,370
Oh, oh.

4083
02:26:37,370 --> 02:26:37,510
Oh, oh.

4084
02:26:37,510 --> 02:26:38,930
What were you thinking about?

4085
02:26:39,590 --> 02:26:40,070
You?

4086
02:26:40,410 --> 02:26:40,890
Nice.

4087
02:26:45,890 --> 02:26:46,670
Water Raid.

4088
02:26:47,770 --> 02:26:48,690
Jack him harder!

4089
02:26:50,150 --> 02:26:51,250
Okay, believe me.

4090
02:26:51,910 --> 02:26:53,090
No, it's true.

4091
02:26:53,310 --> 02:26:55,110
He's gotta jack as hard as he can.

4092
02:26:56,490 --> 02:26:57,690
You can't look him in the eyes!

4093
02:26:57,690 --> 02:26:59,870
If you keep jacking this hard, somebody's gonna start a fire.

4094
02:27:01,090 --> 02:27:02,450
You gotta look him in the eyes!

4095
02:27:02,470 --> 02:27:02,570
Friction.

4096
02:27:03,850 --> 02:27:05,270
Oh, we're distracting him.

4097
02:27:05,330 --> 02:27:05,810
We should stop.

4098
02:27:06,910 --> 02:27:07,870
Round three.

4099
02:27:08,530 --> 02:27:09,050
Maybe.

4100
02:27:09,290 --> 02:27:09,950
Nice duck.

4101
02:27:10,090 --> 02:27:10,490
Nice duck.

4102
02:27:13,550 --> 02:27:14,070
Woo!

4103
02:27:14,290 --> 02:27:15,790
Fuck yeah, counter hit.

4104
02:27:15,850 --> 02:27:16,750
Blue spark, everything.

4105
02:27:21,330 --> 02:27:23,030
Dong, dong, dong.

4106
02:27:23,530 --> 02:27:24,050
Yeah!

4107
02:27:25,910 --> 02:27:27,330
Oh, that was sick.

4108
02:27:27,530 --> 02:27:28,250
That's so good.

4109
02:27:28,350 --> 02:27:28,530
Yeah.

4110
02:27:28,710 --> 02:27:29,310
That was sick.

4111
02:27:30,150 --> 02:27:31,670
You're spanking a lot.

4112
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:37,040
Ooh.

4113
02:27:37,400 --> 02:27:37,800
Ooh.

4114
02:27:43,220 --> 02:27:44,900
Damn, the double jacks, man.

4115
02:27:46,200 --> 02:27:47,220
No way.

4116
02:27:47,340 --> 02:27:47,580
Ooh!

4117
02:27:47,960 --> 02:27:48,480
Oh.

4118
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:51,720
Nice!

4119
02:27:55,380 --> 02:27:55,940
Let's go!

4120
02:27:56,040 --> 02:27:56,560
Nice!

4121
02:27:56,740 --> 02:27:57,880
Counter hit, dude.

4122
02:27:57,940 --> 02:27:59,760
Get back on Eddie.

4123
02:27:59,940 --> 02:28:02,840
Get back on Eddie!

4124
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:06,880
I'm throwing a set away!

4125
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:07,680
Thank you.

4126
02:28:08,440 --> 02:28:09,920
I'm throwing the set away.

4127
02:28:10,140 --> 02:28:11,280
Alright, yeah, leave the lobby.

4128
02:28:11,440 --> 02:28:11,700
Alright.

4129
02:28:11,700 --> 02:28:12,160
We're gonna change.

4130
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:14,600
Don't do that.

4131
02:28:14,980 --> 02:28:20,360
I know, I know, like, you got a lot of Tekken experience under your years and shit, but in a new game, just play Eddie.

4132
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:21,480
I wanna fight.

4133
02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:24,320
What the fuck?

4134
02:28:24,860 --> 02:28:26,600
I don't know why you picked Jack on me, man.

4135
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:28,700
Well, remember when we were gonna bot review him?

4136
02:28:28,940 --> 02:28:29,720
I know, right?

4137
02:28:29,720 --> 02:28:30,680
I thought Jack would play.

4138
02:28:30,940 --> 02:28:32,200
He did play Jack, yeah.

4139
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:35,780
He's got a very legacy Jack.

4140
02:28:36,040 --> 02:28:37,380
Not a single gamma hell.

4141
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:40,740
Yeah, he didn't do a DZ check, bro.

4142
02:28:40,740 --> 02:28:41,520
Oh my fucking god, I hate this guy.

4143
02:28:41,580 --> 02:28:42,980
Alright, Brawl Pro, I actually need your help.

4144
02:28:43,060 --> 02:28:43,180
Next round.

4145
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:44,220
Oh, Savina.

4146
02:28:44,940 --> 02:28:46,560
Oh, remember that power crush?

4147
02:28:46,960 --> 02:28:48,140
Oh shit, thank you.

4148
02:28:49,740 --> 02:28:51,200
So you pressure him?

4149
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:52,560
You can, yeah.

4150
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:54,880
Okay.

4151
02:29:01,860 --> 02:29:02,340
Savina?

4152
02:29:02,460 --> 02:29:04,160
Why do they play such freaky characters?

4153
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:06,340
I've not seen this before.

4154
02:29:06,920 --> 02:29:08,680
Dude, she's so freaky.

4155
02:29:08,780 --> 02:29:09,560
Watch, watch.

4156
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:10,440
She'll get on the ground.

4157
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:11,560
It's a freak festival.

4158
02:29:11,860 --> 02:29:13,980
Is it the one where she climbs on, like, a spider?

4159
02:29:13,980 --> 02:29:15,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4160
02:29:15,540 --> 02:29:16,340
Bro, I hate you.

4161
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:18,060
Okay.

4162
02:29:18,240 --> 02:29:18,640
Oh.

4163
02:29:19,700 --> 02:29:20,140
Uh oh.

4164
02:29:20,340 --> 02:29:23,640
Oh my god.

4165
02:29:23,700 --> 02:29:23,900
Good shit.

4166
02:29:24,020 --> 02:29:24,660
What a genius.

4167
02:29:25,020 --> 02:29:25,620
Nice.

4168
02:29:26,600 --> 02:29:27,200
Ooh!

4169
02:29:31,780 --> 02:29:33,460
Send him to space, Jack.

4170
02:29:34,580 --> 02:29:35,980
You're going into orbit.

4171
02:29:36,260 --> 02:29:36,660
Hahaha.

4172
02:29:44,270 --> 02:29:44,870
Hahaha.

4173
02:29:45,270 --> 02:29:46,110
Round two.

4174
02:29:46,750 --> 02:29:47,350
Fight.

4175
02:29:49,790 --> 02:29:50,550
That's not fair.

4176
02:29:51,270 --> 02:29:51,790
Hahaha.

4177
02:29:53,490 --> 02:29:54,310
Spamming is banned.

4178
02:29:54,530 --> 02:29:55,410
Somebody should tell him.

4179
02:29:55,910 --> 02:29:56,650
No, no, no.

4180
02:29:56,790 --> 02:29:57,030
We...

4181
02:29:57,610 --> 02:29:58,890
Alley kicks have been paying us.

4182
02:29:59,630 --> 02:30:00,430
No, no, no.

4183
02:30:02,610 --> 02:30:04,290
We need the alley kicks.

4184
02:30:04,650 --> 02:30:07,090
I almost beat SK on alley kicks alone.

4185
02:30:07,790 --> 02:30:08,310
Hahaha.

4186
02:30:08,590 --> 02:30:08,870
Hahaha.

4187
02:30:10,190 --> 02:30:15,190
The fact that it worked, like, not once, but three times in a row was what surprised me.

4188
02:30:15,190 --> 02:30:15,470
The fact that it worked, like, not once, but three times in a row was what surprised me.

4189
02:30:15,590 --> 02:30:16,050
What is she doing?

4190
02:30:17,590 --> 02:30:19,130
What is she doing?

4191
02:30:19,130 --> 02:30:20,250
If she had a fist on her head, she would die.

4192
02:30:20,450 --> 02:30:20,750
Hahaha.

4193
02:30:21,610 --> 02:30:23,010
Why is she doing that?

4194
02:30:23,310 --> 02:30:25,270
That is not an advantageous position.

4195
02:30:27,670 --> 02:30:28,670
Like a watermelon.

4196
02:30:30,650 --> 02:30:31,050
Ooh.

4197
02:30:31,490 --> 02:30:33,610
She weighs, like, 110 pounds.

4198
02:30:34,170 --> 02:30:34,570
Hahaha.

4199
02:30:35,650 --> 02:30:36,410
Alright, never mind.

4200
02:30:36,450 --> 02:30:37,250
I'm not afraid of Zav.

4201
02:30:37,550 --> 02:30:38,590
We get one punch.

4202
02:30:38,930 --> 02:30:39,350
Let's go.

4203
02:30:40,530 --> 02:30:43,030
58 defense, my go 58 defense.

4204
02:30:43,350 --> 02:30:43,750
58.

4205
02:30:44,610 --> 02:30:45,450
That's two, right?

4206
02:30:45,510 --> 02:30:46,130
I don't have to fight again?

4207
02:30:46,130 --> 02:30:47,110
What do you do?

4208
02:30:47,570 --> 02:30:48,510
Well, there's one more.

4209
02:30:48,570 --> 02:30:49,050
One more season.

4210
02:30:49,150 --> 02:30:49,930
Yeah, you won two.

4211
02:30:50,030 --> 02:30:50,490
Yeah, sorry.

4212
02:30:50,970 --> 02:30:51,590
So I'm good.

4213
02:30:51,690 --> 02:30:52,030
I leave?

4214
02:30:52,210 --> 02:30:52,350
Yeah.

4215
02:30:52,850 --> 02:30:53,610
Okay, okay, alright.

4216
02:30:53,790 --> 02:30:56,650
Dude, if I lose a third Koja match, I need a therapy session.

4217
02:30:57,930 --> 02:30:59,950
Okay, I will give you the biggest hug at EVO.

4218
02:30:59,950 --> 02:31:00,630
We're gonna be there anyway.

4219
02:31:00,690 --> 02:31:01,270
Don't worry about it.

4220
02:31:01,310 --> 02:31:01,530
It's alright.

4221
02:31:01,810 --> 02:31:02,950
Let's all get dinner, bro.

4222
02:31:03,070 --> 02:31:03,930
Let's go to EVO.

4223
02:31:03,930 --> 02:31:04,530
I want to.

4224
02:31:04,730 --> 02:31:07,770
I was trying to figure out, like, a good fucking dinner spot.

4225
02:31:07,870 --> 02:31:08,770
So I was gonna hit you guys up.

4226
02:31:08,790 --> 02:31:09,530
Be like, hey, you wanna...

4227
02:31:09,530 --> 02:31:10,990
Where is EVO this year?

4228
02:31:11,150 --> 02:31:11,890
Yeah, I'm down, dude.

4229
02:31:12,490 --> 02:31:13,850
It's in EVO every year.

4230
02:31:13,950 --> 02:31:14,270
Doki.

4231
02:31:16,130 --> 02:31:16,230
I don't know.

4232
02:31:16,230 --> 02:31:16,830
Are we gonna win?

4233
02:31:17,490 --> 02:31:18,250
Oh, you know.

4234
02:31:19,650 --> 02:31:21,550
I think I love that response.

4235
02:31:21,730 --> 02:31:22,150
That is good.

4236
02:31:23,730 --> 02:31:24,990
Supers... I think he's gonna go too.

4237
02:31:25,090 --> 02:31:26,070
So we should invite him to dinner.

4238
02:31:26,430 --> 02:31:26,830
Yeah.

4239
02:31:29,350 --> 02:31:32,430
You got this, my goat, my uncle, my dad, my everything.

4240
02:31:32,490 --> 02:31:33,270
Come on, coach.

4241
02:31:33,630 --> 02:31:34,530
This is it.

4242
02:31:35,470 --> 02:31:36,730
Gotta bring it home.

4243
02:31:38,070 --> 02:31:38,650
That's right.

4244
02:31:38,690 --> 02:31:40,030
I'll study up for the tourney.

4245
02:31:41,690 --> 02:31:43,730
Like on the... in two days from now.

4246
02:31:44,850 --> 02:31:45,870
I see my mistakes.

4247
02:31:46,130 --> 02:31:48,750
Like, they'll duck like I grab and then I'll lose like half my life.

4248
02:31:48,890 --> 02:31:49,250
And then they'll...

4249
02:31:49,250 --> 02:31:51,110
situation me and then...

4250
02:31:51,110 --> 02:31:52,710
It's rough out here, man.

4251
02:31:52,890 --> 02:31:53,850
These guys are good.

4252
02:31:55,130 --> 02:31:56,590
How did he improve so fast?

4253
02:31:56,830 --> 02:31:57,330
I don't understand.

4254
02:31:59,190 --> 02:32:00,150
Steve this time?

4255
02:32:00,330 --> 02:32:01,450
You're supposed to stop.

4256
02:32:03,530 --> 02:32:04,910
Alright, I'm gonna close my chat.

4257
02:32:05,390 --> 02:32:05,790
Steven?

4258
02:32:06,530 --> 02:32:07,650
We'll be your chat.

4259
02:32:09,010 --> 02:32:10,130
We'll be your chat.

4260
02:32:10,190 --> 02:32:10,530
Don't worry.

4261
02:32:11,050 --> 02:32:13,030
Is that Bayonetta on Steve?

4262
02:32:13,310 --> 02:32:13,710
Yeah.

4263
02:32:13,710 --> 02:32:14,690
That's Steven.

4264
02:32:14,930 --> 02:32:15,910
That's Steven.

4265
02:32:17,670 --> 02:32:19,030
Bayonetta and gender bend.

4266
02:32:19,470 --> 02:32:19,870
Fight.

4267
02:32:23,770 --> 02:32:24,710
Mm-hmm.

4268
02:32:35,820 --> 02:32:37,180
Damn it.

4269
02:32:37,660 --> 02:32:39,600
Oh, it's Kojima!

4270
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:42,240
Oh, maybe.

4271
02:32:43,380 --> 02:32:45,820
Kojima doesn't wear pajama bottoms.

4272
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:47,380
Oh, no.

4273
02:32:48,440 --> 02:32:49,540
Kojima on break.

4274
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:00,800
Good shit.

4275
02:33:09,570 --> 02:33:11,050
I like the little push.

4276
02:33:13,070 --> 02:33:13,710
Nice.

4277
02:33:22,740 --> 02:33:23,380
Nice.

4278
02:33:24,540 --> 02:33:26,740
What the fuck I'm talking about, baby?

4279
02:33:27,100 --> 02:33:27,780
Oh, yeah.

4280
02:33:29,340 --> 02:33:30,260
I'm not sure.

4281
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:31,960
Round three.

4282
02:33:32,820 --> 02:33:33,460
Four.

4283
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:47,400
Damn.

4284
02:33:47,660 --> 02:33:47,740
Damn.

4285
02:33:49,320 --> 02:33:49,880
Oh.

4286
02:33:51,160 --> 02:33:51,720
Oh.

4287
02:33:53,460 --> 02:33:54,280
Freaky, Steve.

4288
02:33:54,900 --> 02:33:55,800
I'll say it.

4289
02:33:57,260 --> 02:33:59,220
It's just us against the freaky army.

4290
02:34:01,120 --> 02:34:01,800
That's it.

4291
02:34:02,320 --> 02:34:04,860
Every team just studied our gameplay only.

4292
02:34:05,260 --> 02:34:07,140
It's a world of degenerates.

4293
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:09,020
It's a world

4294
02:34:12,880 --> 02:34:14,060
of degenerates.

4295
02:34:14,920 --> 02:34:15,500
It's a world of degenerates.

4296
02:34:15,500 --> 02:34:15,520
Shit.

4297
02:34:15,740 --> 02:34:15,880
Shit.

4298
02:34:18,960 --> 02:34:20,320
Oh, nice.

4299
02:34:20,780 --> 02:34:21,460
Nice?

4300
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:22,260
Okay.

4301
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:25,020
Kojima in the nut.

4302
02:34:27,460 --> 02:34:28,140
Oh!

4303
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:30,340
Good shit.

4304
02:34:30,420 --> 02:34:30,800
Nice.

4305
02:34:38,140 --> 02:34:41,500
I love how it's like chicken playing chicken right now.

4306
02:34:42,720 --> 02:34:43,400
Nice.

4307
02:34:45,220 --> 02:34:46,100
Let's go.

4308
02:34:46,680 --> 02:34:47,140
Good shit.

4309
02:34:47,980 --> 02:34:48,800
Alley kick, baby.

4310
02:34:48,940 --> 02:34:49,600
Alley kick, baby.

4311
02:34:49,880 --> 02:34:50,680
Alley kick, baby.

4312
02:34:50,780 --> 02:34:51,240
Hell, yeah.

4313
02:34:51,340 --> 02:34:52,120
Good ass move.

4314
02:34:52,700 --> 02:34:53,140
Hell, yeah.

4315
02:34:53,140 --> 02:34:55,680
We get distributions from big alley kick.

4316
02:34:55,840 --> 02:34:56,280
Yeah.

4317
02:34:58,340 --> 02:34:59,900
The alley kick clutch.

4318
02:35:04,880 --> 02:35:06,160
That's a wall, Steven.

4319
02:35:06,980 --> 02:35:07,900
Take him to that wall.

4320
02:35:14,480 --> 02:35:15,340
Bro is counting.

4321
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:16,460
One, two, three.

4322
02:35:16,520 --> 02:35:17,660
One, two, three, four.

4323
02:35:18,760 --> 02:35:19,200
Oh.

4324
02:35:22,600 --> 02:35:23,040
Nice.

4325
02:35:23,300 --> 02:35:24,500
How does it fucking move?

4326
02:35:26,580 --> 02:35:27,660
We need this.

4327
02:35:27,720 --> 02:35:28,120
Ouch.

4328
02:35:28,320 --> 02:35:29,180
What the fuck?

4329
02:35:29,440 --> 02:35:30,100
Low parry?

4330
02:35:30,220 --> 02:35:31,020
How, dude?

4331
02:35:31,560 --> 02:35:32,940
What was that move?

4332
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:36,260
That move hit the end?

4333
02:35:36,380 --> 02:35:36,560
Ow.

4334
02:35:37,780 --> 02:35:38,600
It would hurt.

4335
02:35:39,420 --> 02:35:40,440
Blood is a boxer.

4336
02:35:40,560 --> 02:35:42,140
They don't do that shit in his ring.

4337
02:35:42,980 --> 02:35:43,860
Come on.

4338
02:35:44,440 --> 02:35:45,780
My overall is attacking.

4339
02:35:47,560 --> 02:35:48,220
Go, baby.

4340
02:35:48,940 --> 02:35:50,200
I don't even know what this move is.

4341
02:35:50,320 --> 02:35:50,720
Take that.

4342
02:35:51,480 --> 02:35:52,220
Maybe one of these.

4343
02:35:52,780 --> 02:35:53,100
Oh.

4344
02:35:53,980 --> 02:35:55,460
It's like a chiropractor.

4345
02:35:57,060 --> 02:35:58,520
I'm just gonna make a little adjustment.

4346
02:35:58,720 --> 02:35:59,440
You guys.

4347
02:36:06,510 --> 02:36:07,110
Nice.

4348
02:36:18,110 --> 02:36:22,730
This guy is not playing around anymore.

4349
02:36:23,830 --> 02:36:25,270
He keeps saying that.

4350
02:36:26,170 --> 02:36:27,350
Oh, what?

4351
02:36:27,690 --> 02:36:28,670
That was a clinch.

4352
02:36:29,310 --> 02:36:30,730
It doesn't matter.

4353
02:36:31,470 --> 02:36:33,310
Give me some three heads in chat.

4354
02:36:33,510 --> 02:36:34,430
Up out.

4355
02:36:34,870 --> 02:36:35,570
Done.

4356
02:36:36,850 --> 02:36:38,430
One, two, three.

4357
02:36:41,870 --> 02:36:42,670
He.

4358
02:36:43,510 --> 02:36:44,310
Beans.

4359
02:36:44,410 --> 02:36:45,210
Sausage.

4360
02:36:45,490 --> 02:36:46,190
Smash.

4361
02:36:47,890 --> 02:36:49,370
Oh my god.

4362
02:36:51,250 --> 02:36:52,370
I'm saved.

4363
02:36:52,890 --> 02:36:53,770
Simple as.

4364
02:36:57,070 --> 02:36:57,770
Oh, no way.

4365
02:36:59,710 --> 02:37:01,130
That was so weird.

4366
02:37:01,310 --> 02:37:04,250
Oh, good.

4367
02:37:04,630 --> 02:37:05,330
Oh, no.

4368
02:37:07,490 --> 02:37:08,130
Push.

4369
02:37:11,270 --> 02:37:11,830
Get up, coach.

4370
02:37:16,290 --> 02:37:17,230
Oh, man.

4371
02:37:17,850 --> 02:37:18,490
Wow.

4372
02:37:19,230 --> 02:37:20,410
That was so sick.

4373
02:37:20,410 --> 02:37:21,310
Oh my god.

4374
02:37:21,530 --> 02:37:24,090
That was good from him.

4375
02:37:24,290 --> 02:37:24,930
Yeah.

4376
02:37:26,310 --> 02:37:26,950
Fight.

4377
02:37:29,230 --> 02:37:30,470
Oh, nice.

4378
02:37:30,770 --> 02:37:32,150
Oh, nice.

4379
02:37:32,150 --> 02:37:34,950
I'm so fucking funny that that's his optimal look.

4380
02:37:34,950 --> 02:37:39,730
I'm so fucking funny that that's his optimal look.

4381
02:37:40,530 --> 02:37:42,090
He's so clean with the float.

4382
02:37:44,950 --> 02:37:45,970
He's doing it.

4383
02:37:47,850 --> 02:37:48,450
Buddy.

4384
02:37:56,280 --> 02:37:56,680
Nice.

4385
02:37:57,160 --> 02:37:57,600
Okay.

4386
02:37:58,360 --> 02:37:58,840
One more.

4387
02:37:59,020 --> 02:37:59,520
One more.

4388
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:00,560
That's for your life.

4389
02:38:01,320 --> 02:38:02,060
Good shit.

4390
02:38:02,640 --> 02:38:04,400
Good shit, bro, bro.

4391
02:38:05,180 --> 02:38:06,280
I love you, Unc.

4392
02:38:07,800 --> 02:38:08,740
Let's get this done.

4393
02:38:14,780 --> 02:38:16,220
Oh, look at all these blocks.

4394
02:38:16,860 --> 02:38:16,880
Oh, look at all these blocks.

4395
02:38:16,880 --> 02:38:16,900
Oh, look at all these blocks.

4396
02:38:18,060 --> 02:38:18,500
Smash.

4397
02:38:20,920 --> 02:38:21,360
Nice.

4398
02:38:21,580 --> 02:38:21,940
Yeah.

4399
02:38:24,140 --> 02:38:25,020
Bust his ass.

4400
02:38:27,740 --> 02:38:28,420
Oh, wow.

4401
02:38:28,420 --> 02:38:29,160
Oh.

4402
02:38:34,470 --> 02:38:35,210
Oh, yes.

4403
02:38:35,450 --> 02:38:36,730
Oh, take him to the wall.

4404
02:38:36,790 --> 02:38:36,990
Yes.

4405
02:38:37,230 --> 02:38:38,750
Real freaky hours.

4406
02:38:39,290 --> 02:38:40,730
We're in the basement now.

4407
02:38:41,010 --> 02:38:41,930
It's wall time.

4408
02:38:42,130 --> 02:38:43,170
What am I getting the wall?

4409
02:38:45,090 --> 02:38:45,530
Yes.

4410
02:38:46,770 --> 02:38:47,850
Call him wall pro.

4411
02:38:48,570 --> 02:38:50,130
Oh, he blocked that?

4412
02:38:50,750 --> 02:38:53,350
Yeah, he has to rest a little.

4413
02:38:53,850 --> 02:38:55,010
He's got no clutch bone.

4414
02:38:55,070 --> 02:38:55,570
No clutch bone.

4415
02:38:57,930 --> 02:38:59,370
What the fuck did he just do?

4416
02:39:02,150 --> 02:39:03,130
Oh, I pressed.

4417
02:39:04,390 --> 02:39:04,850
No.

4418
02:39:05,430 --> 02:39:06,050
Nice try.

4419
02:39:06,170 --> 02:39:06,390
Nice try.

4420
02:39:06,430 --> 02:39:06,650
Nice try.

4421
02:39:06,690 --> 02:39:07,910
That was a nice try.

4422
02:39:07,910 --> 02:39:11,730
That was a good rage art.

4423
02:39:12,370 --> 02:39:12,830
Yeah.

4424
02:39:12,910 --> 02:39:13,470
That was good.

4425
02:39:13,870 --> 02:39:15,750
That was a really good rage art.

4426
02:39:15,750 --> 02:39:18,290
That was a good fight, though.

4427
02:39:18,310 --> 02:39:18,570
That was good.

4428
02:39:18,770 --> 02:39:19,090
Yeah.

4429
02:39:19,190 --> 02:39:20,450
That was a really good match.

4430
02:39:21,110 --> 02:39:21,570
Woo.

4431
02:39:22,150 --> 02:39:23,070
That match was insane.

4432
02:39:25,850 --> 02:39:26,310
Download.

4433
02:39:30,780 --> 02:39:32,060
He's only 26, Daniel.

4434
02:39:32,180 --> 02:39:33,320
You're 100 Daniels.

4435
02:39:34,800 --> 02:39:37,620
Come on, you win this, you'll be 120 Daniels.

4436
02:39:37,760 --> 02:39:39,300
You steal his Daniels.

4437
02:39:39,320 --> 02:39:39,580
Yeah.

4438
02:39:41,220 --> 02:39:43,040
Those Daniels need a new home.

4439
02:39:58,360 --> 02:39:58,980
Oh.

4440
02:40:00,040 --> 02:40:00,980
Oh, wow.

4441
02:40:09,100 --> 02:40:10,060
Nice break.

4442
02:40:11,940 --> 02:40:13,180
That was unfortunate.

4443
02:40:14,380 --> 02:40:15,580
Round two.

4444
02:40:15,620 --> 02:40:16,000
Round two.

4445
02:40:16,180 --> 02:40:16,800
Round two.

4446
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:19,000
Oh.

4447
02:40:20,600 --> 02:40:21,600
Damn.

4448
02:40:26,580 --> 02:40:27,580
Nice.

4449
02:40:40,220 --> 02:40:41,220
Oh.

4450
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:42,500
Shit.

4451
02:40:50,700 --> 02:40:52,220
Oh my god.

4452
02:40:52,320 --> 02:40:54,400
Oh my god.

4453
02:40:54,400 --> 02:40:55,100
Those ducks.

4454
02:40:55,680 --> 02:40:56,280
Let's go.

4455
02:40:56,280 --> 02:40:56,500
Let's go.

4456
02:40:58,540 --> 02:41:00,520
It's like he actually knows how to play Tekken.

4457
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:01,680
Fight.

4458
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:07,040
Nice.

4459
02:41:07,540 --> 02:41:08,440
Oh my god, that camera.

4460
02:41:10,080 --> 02:41:10,920
Oh, double.

4461
02:41:12,860 --> 02:41:13,880
It's his alley kick.

4462
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:14,860
His brain is scrambled.

4463
02:41:15,100 --> 02:41:15,920
His brain is scrambled.

4464
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:19,100
No one knows what to do.

4465
02:41:19,300 --> 02:41:20,240
His brain is scrambled.

4466
02:41:21,220 --> 02:41:22,100
Do it again.

4467
02:41:23,720 --> 02:41:24,220
Let's go.

4468
02:41:24,820 --> 02:41:25,780
Let's fucking go.

4469
02:41:25,780 --> 02:41:27,760
I think he's scrambled, bro.

4470
02:41:27,920 --> 02:41:28,620
Take it home.

4471
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:32,600
He saw what I did to SK and he got worried.

4472
02:41:33,140 --> 02:41:33,920
He saw what I did to SK and he got worried.

4473
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:35,200
His brain is hot right now.

4474
02:41:39,860 --> 02:41:40,480
Oh, whoa.

4475
02:41:40,520 --> 02:41:41,580
That was a good sidestep.

4476
02:41:43,760 --> 02:41:44,200
Nice.

4477
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:44,840
Nice.

4478
02:41:47,420 --> 02:41:48,360
Yeah, he's not done yet.

4479
02:41:49,660 --> 02:41:50,100
Hm.

4480
02:41:58,780 --> 02:41:59,340
Nice.

4481
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:00,860
What the fuck are you talking about?

4482
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:01,420
Yeah.

4483
02:42:03,420 --> 02:42:04,000
Yes.

4484
02:42:04,300 --> 02:42:05,100
The bomb.

4485
02:42:08,010 --> 02:42:09,190
Let's fucking go.

4486
02:42:10,490 --> 02:42:14,150
Let's go, coach.

4487
02:42:15,710 --> 02:42:16,190
Yes.

4488
02:42:16,190 --> 02:42:16,990
Take the win.

4489
02:42:17,910 --> 02:42:19,110
That's what you thought.

4490
02:42:19,110 --> 02:42:20,210
Good shit, dude.

4491
02:42:20,510 --> 02:42:22,230
Oh, not even close.

4492
02:42:24,190 --> 02:42:25,590
It's because he used to play Melee.

4493
02:42:25,950 --> 02:42:26,410
Yeah, true.

4494
02:42:28,410 --> 02:42:30,690
He's got that actual unbreakable monkey.

4495
02:42:30,750 --> 02:42:32,790
Okay, his name is Brawl Bro to be clear.

4496
02:42:32,890 --> 02:42:33,390
Guys, we gotta...

4497
02:42:33,390 --> 02:42:34,310
I think we claim him.

4498
02:42:34,470 --> 02:42:36,810
We gotta congratulate him on his first win today.

4499
02:42:37,210 --> 02:42:38,210
His first win.

4500
02:42:39,230 --> 02:42:40,050
Let's go, coach.

4501
02:42:40,710 --> 02:42:43,270
Welcome to the club.

4502
02:42:43,290 --> 02:42:43,630
Join the club.

4503
02:42:46,150 --> 02:42:47,790
Join the winner's club.

4504
02:42:48,670 --> 02:42:50,150
Good fucking shit.

4505
02:42:50,430 --> 02:42:50,970
Nice job.

4506
02:42:51,170 --> 02:42:52,690
Hey, we kinda did well.

4507
02:42:52,810 --> 02:42:54,730
Yeah, we fucking... we were cooking.

4508
02:42:54,750 --> 02:42:55,370
3-2, not bad.

4509
02:42:56,410 --> 02:42:57,010
We take those.

4510
02:42:57,250 --> 02:42:59,490
Positive record, especially, you know, 5 points per.

4511
02:42:59,570 --> 02:42:59,970
That's big.

4512
02:43:00,070 --> 02:43:00,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4513
02:43:02,410 --> 02:43:02,810
Alright.

4514
02:43:03,990 --> 02:43:05,630
Yeah, we're looking good so far.

4515
02:43:05,790 --> 02:43:07,050
Because we did 4-1.

4516
02:43:08,130 --> 02:43:09,030
Let me see.

4517
02:43:09,090 --> 02:43:09,650
4-1.

4518
02:43:09,950 --> 02:43:11,850
1-4, but then 3-2.

4519
02:43:11,930 --> 02:43:12,710
So we're in a good spot.

4520
02:43:15,030 --> 02:43:15,650
I think...

4521
02:43:16,130 --> 02:43:18,250
Also, we got the hardest team out of the way.

4522
02:43:18,330 --> 02:43:19,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4523
02:43:19,750 --> 02:43:20,450
Don't say that.

4524
02:43:21,830 --> 02:43:23,310
You're gonna carve us, bro.

4525
02:43:23,430 --> 02:43:24,750
The hardest team for you.

4526
02:43:26,410 --> 02:43:26,770
I think that's true.

4527
02:43:26,770 --> 02:43:28,950
I think Matt's just like, all teams are the same.

4528
02:43:29,170 --> 02:43:31,530
I got all demons every single day of my life.

4529
02:43:31,550 --> 02:43:33,090
I'm fighting them, I'm falling asleep.

4530
02:43:33,250 --> 02:43:33,770
And you beat them all.

4531
02:43:34,010 --> 02:43:36,030
You haven't lost yet, Jack.

4532
02:43:36,170 --> 02:43:37,830
Dude, I will be losing.

4533
02:43:38,310 --> 02:43:41,190
You've literally been saying that for two slams.

4534
02:43:41,230 --> 02:43:42,030
It's his strat.

4535
02:43:42,050 --> 02:43:44,330
It's like his reverse jinx.

4536
02:43:44,630 --> 02:43:46,770
It's actually impossible for me to lose.

4537
02:43:46,850 --> 02:43:49,530
Because if I lose, then I'll say, yeah, I told you guys I would lose.

4538
02:43:49,650 --> 02:43:51,350
But if I don't, then I look like a fucking god.

4539
02:43:52,370 --> 02:43:54,530
You laugh at this.

4540
02:43:57,190 --> 02:43:58,590
But yeah, I'll be losing soon.

4541
02:43:59,170 --> 02:44:00,050
Don't say that.

4542
02:44:00,170 --> 02:44:00,850
Don't say that.

4543
02:44:01,050 --> 02:44:02,970
Because what if that happens in the finals?

4544
02:44:03,510 --> 02:44:04,830
Dude, because Scarra is hella random.

4545
02:44:05,110 --> 02:44:07,750
We got Scarra and Amaz.

4546
02:44:07,850 --> 02:44:08,830
You guys saw how they were playing.

4547
02:44:08,970 --> 02:44:11,550
Armor, hopkick, armor, dick jab.

4548
02:44:11,730 --> 02:44:13,170
Every defensive option ever.

4549
02:44:13,290 --> 02:44:15,310
I gotta make a read on what the fuck they're gonna do.

4550
02:44:16,870 --> 02:44:17,750
You guys read?

4551
02:44:19,210 --> 02:44:20,030
Not me, man.

4552
02:44:21,850 --> 02:44:23,730
I brain rot away playing Overwatch.

4553
02:44:23,730 --> 02:44:24,590
And Tekken.

4554
02:44:26,170 --> 02:44:28,090
Do we have a while until the next one?

4555
02:44:28,230 --> 02:44:29,430
Yeah, do we have a while?

4556
02:44:29,610 --> 02:44:30,230
Not sure.

4557
02:44:31,010 --> 02:44:33,830
I'm gonna go get some water and use the bathroom.

4558
02:44:34,050 --> 02:44:34,810
Little refresher.

4559
02:44:34,930 --> 02:44:35,170
Alright.

4560
02:44:39,570 --> 02:44:41,290
Time to practice Tekken.

4561
02:44:44,270 --> 02:44:46,790
Oh my god,

4562
02:44:51,080 --> 02:44:52,300
I'm playing as a Tenryu now.

4563
02:44:52,760 --> 02:44:53,900
I'm too high rank.

4564
02:44:54,180 --> 02:44:55,400
I don't belong here.

4565
02:45:14,570 --> 02:45:15,610
Oh my god.

4566
02:45:15,610 --> 02:45:16,950
Guys, I don't belong in this elo.

4567
02:45:17,050 --> 02:45:18,990
I literally lucked out on this elo.

4568
02:45:19,190 --> 02:45:21,530
I brute forced my way into this elo.

4569
02:45:26,770 --> 02:45:29,650
Literally, I have not been playing that much Tekken.

4570
02:45:30,550 --> 02:45:33,510
I'm pretty... I don't think I belong here.

4571
02:45:34,030 --> 02:45:34,730
I don't think I belong here.

4572
02:45:39,830 --> 02:45:42,630
Oh no, please leave me alone.

4573
02:45:44,250 --> 02:45:46,510
I don't even know how to juggle!

4574
02:45:47,110 --> 02:45:49,770
That's how I don't belong here!

4575
02:45:53,430 --> 02:45:56,770
I don't even know how to juggle people!

4576
02:46:05,570 --> 02:46:06,090
Yay!

4577
02:46:06,090 --> 02:46:07,490
Whoops, that was an accident.

4578
02:46:08,930 --> 02:46:10,290
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

4579
02:46:12,430 --> 02:46:13,190
Here you go.

4580
02:46:13,470 --> 02:46:13,970
Yay!

4581
02:46:15,330 --> 02:46:17,310
Curried by alley kicks!

4582
02:46:17,970 --> 02:46:21,830
Bro, some people spend their entire lives fucking grinding to this elo.

4583
02:46:22,230 --> 02:46:23,930
I don't know how I get here.

4584
02:46:26,490 --> 02:46:27,930
That's the saddest part.

4585
02:46:29,470 --> 02:46:31,930
Some people spend their entire lives getting here.

4586
02:46:32,150 --> 02:46:33,150
I just existed.

4587
02:46:36,950 --> 02:46:38,790
I alley kicked my way to victory.

4588
02:46:53,140 --> 02:46:59,360
I think, like, including the games now, I think I have 30 hours on Tekken.

4589
02:46:59,720 --> 02:47:02,060
30 hours on Tekken for a red rank.

4590
02:47:02,360 --> 02:47:03,200
It just works!

4591
02:47:03,800 --> 02:47:05,040
Just don't kill it!

4592
02:47:10,100 --> 02:47:12,660
Told you, I don't belong here!

4593
02:47:12,740 --> 02:47:12,840
Don't kill it!

4594
02:47:12,860 --> 02:47:17,920
The moment I learned a 5th and 6th move, I went up two ranks.

4595
02:47:18,740 --> 02:47:22,160
Like, yesterday I was at, I think, Dominator?

4596
02:47:22,580 --> 02:47:24,880
I think yesterday I was at Dominator.

4597
02:47:24,920 --> 02:47:27,260
I think I started at Dominator or something.

4598
02:47:27,500 --> 02:47:27,880
Right?

4599
02:47:28,620 --> 02:47:29,920
And then in like...

4600
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:33,480
And then when I learned the 5th and 6th move, I went up to red.

4601
02:47:33,880 --> 02:47:34,820
So like...

4602
02:47:35,560 --> 02:47:37,900
Every move unlocks a rank!

4603
02:47:41,320 --> 02:47:42,960
She keeps getting away!

4604
02:47:43,140 --> 02:47:43,920
I don't know how!

4605
02:47:44,800 --> 02:47:46,340
I don't know how I keep doing it.

4606
02:47:46,440 --> 02:47:47,240
It's actually crazy.

4607
02:47:47,800 --> 02:47:49,520
Like, I literally don't know what I'm doing.

4608
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:51,960
Like...

4609
02:47:53,260 --> 02:47:55,420
I should not be getting away with this.

4610
02:47:55,480 --> 02:47:56,280
Is this the same guy?

4611
02:47:56,480 --> 02:47:56,900
Is it?

4612
02:47:57,340 --> 02:47:58,340
I'm sorry, bro.

4613
02:48:01,300 --> 02:48:02,700
Bro, get your rank back!

4614
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:06,800
Natural instinct!

4615
02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:08,600
Bro, I'd be mad!

4616
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:12,080
Like...

4617
02:48:13,240 --> 02:48:14,120
I'd understand!

4618
02:48:18,500 --> 02:48:19,320
Oh shit.

4619
02:48:19,640 --> 02:48:22,500
Bro, I think he's angry that I tried to one and done him.

4620
02:48:22,680 --> 02:48:23,740
Yeah, he's definitely...

4621
02:48:23,740 --> 02:48:25,180
Guys, I think he's angry.

4622
02:48:28,480 --> 02:48:30,320
I'm pretty sure he's angry.

4623
02:48:34,230 --> 02:48:36,110
I'd be angry too, not gonna lie.

4624
02:48:38,170 --> 02:48:38,750
Yeah!

4625
02:48:39,690 --> 02:48:42,270
Oh, he actually defended that.

4626
02:48:43,590 --> 02:48:44,710
Please!

4627
02:48:49,290 --> 02:48:50,150
I'm sorry!

4628
02:48:50,890 --> 02:48:51,810
I'm sorry!

4629
02:48:53,690 --> 02:48:55,410
I'm so sorry!

4630
02:49:00,050 --> 02:49:01,770
I'm so sorry!

4631
02:49:03,850 --> 02:49:06,510
I'm so sorry!

4632
02:49:07,430 --> 02:49:07,950
Fight!

4633
02:49:10,550 --> 02:49:11,410
I'm sorry!

4634
02:49:12,690 --> 02:49:14,190
Wait, he actually blocked those?

4635
02:49:14,310 --> 02:49:16,730
That's when you know he's like an actual gamer.

4636
02:49:22,650 --> 02:49:23,410
Oh shit!

4637
02:49:23,550 --> 02:49:24,170
Oh my god!

4638
02:49:24,190 --> 02:49:24,770
He sidestepped!

4639
02:49:24,830 --> 02:49:25,850
He actually knows what he's doing!

4640
02:49:26,570 --> 02:49:28,390
I literally got here as a fluke!

4641
02:49:30,650 --> 02:49:32,110
He got his elo back!

4642
02:49:35,650 --> 02:49:37,230
He figured me out!

4643
02:49:37,970 --> 02:49:38,490
Okay.

4644
02:49:38,490 --> 02:49:38,790
Okay.

4645
02:49:38,790 --> 02:49:40,790
This is why I won and done people.

4646
02:49:41,670 --> 02:49:45,850
Because they figured it out by the second game.

4647
02:49:47,530 --> 02:49:48,650
Alright, here I go!

4648
02:49:50,530 --> 02:49:51,790
Where's the lobby at?

4649
02:49:51,970 --> 02:49:52,510
There it is.

4650
02:49:59,220 --> 02:50:00,920
I'm joining, I'm joining.

4651
02:50:05,240 --> 02:50:07,480
Alright guys, I'm gonna hide the passcode.

4652
02:50:08,660 --> 02:50:10,020
So it's not my fault.

4653
02:50:14,460 --> 02:50:16,360
Alright, guys it's 2250.

4654
02:50:20,790 --> 02:50:22,210
Alright, here I am.

4655
02:50:23,470 --> 02:50:25,130
Guys, I think this guy learned though.

4656
02:50:26,810 --> 02:50:29,790
The Har... Har... what's his name again?

4657
02:50:31,270 --> 02:50:34,310
The LoganRDJ guy, I'm pretty sure he learned how to counter me.

4658
02:50:34,550 --> 02:50:35,490
Okay, back, okay, back.

4659
02:50:37,690 --> 02:50:38,830
I'm pretty sure.

4660
02:50:39,030 --> 02:50:41,450
I abused so many moves on him.

4661
02:50:41,930 --> 02:50:43,090
So we are hiding the thingamajig?

4662
02:50:44,050 --> 02:50:46,210
If you so desire to do so...

4663
02:50:46,370 --> 02:50:48,150
Uncle, you may.

4664
02:50:49,470 --> 02:50:50,590
They're asking if we're ready.

4665
02:50:50,730 --> 02:50:52,390
But none of you guys are in here.

4666
02:50:53,890 --> 02:50:55,570
They're asking if you're ready.

4667
02:50:55,730 --> 02:50:57,710
But none of you are in here.

4668
02:51:00,630 --> 02:51:01,770
I'm about to join.

4669
02:51:01,830 --> 02:51:03,950
Literally, the only person I see is Slime.

4670
02:51:03,990 --> 02:51:06,210
Slime is the only person here with me.

4671
02:51:06,410 --> 02:51:07,330
I'm a good egg.

4672
02:51:07,870 --> 02:51:08,730
I'm a good egg.

4673
02:51:08,730 --> 02:51:08,990
I'm a good eye.

4674
02:51:11,190 --> 02:51:13,150
We're gonna starve without Kony, I guess.

4675
02:51:14,090 --> 02:51:15,710
I'm coming in, I'm coming in, I'm coming in.

4676
02:51:15,770 --> 02:51:15,950
Sorry.

4677
02:51:16,470 --> 02:51:17,990
I'm finishing my match too, sorry.

4678
02:51:26,970 --> 02:51:27,370
I'm finishing my match too, sorry.

4679
02:51:27,370 --> 02:51:29,390
After this, I need to use the bathroom.

4680
02:51:30,490 --> 02:51:31,210
Gotta hurry.

4681
02:51:35,780 --> 02:51:36,540
Oh my god.

4682
02:51:36,840 --> 02:51:38,560
They kicked out Logan.

4683
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:43,300
Alright, I'm in.

4684
02:51:44,420 --> 02:51:44,820
Yippee.

4685
02:51:47,700 --> 02:51:48,580
Alright, we got this.

4686
02:51:49,500 --> 02:51:50,360
This is your time.

4687
02:51:50,580 --> 02:51:51,060
This is it.

4688
02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:53,260
This is it.

4689
02:51:53,260 --> 02:51:54,480
Wait, he didn't rank up.

4690
02:51:54,540 --> 02:51:57,800
You're actually the same rank as this guy.

4691
02:51:57,940 --> 02:51:58,140
Yeah.

4692
02:51:58,560 --> 02:52:00,020
Why didn't this guy rank up?

4693
02:52:01,720 --> 02:52:03,280
Not have a grind set.

4694
02:52:03,380 --> 02:52:04,180
No grind set like you.

4695
02:52:04,300 --> 02:52:04,440
What?

4696
02:52:05,140 --> 02:52:07,600
This guy started like a week earlier than me.

4697
02:52:07,640 --> 02:52:08,920
And I caught up in three days.

4698
02:52:14,620 --> 02:52:15,500
How's that possible?

4699
02:52:21,330 --> 02:52:22,310
Here I go.

4700
02:52:22,950 --> 02:52:23,570
It's okay.

4701
02:52:23,630 --> 02:52:24,450
If I lose, it's okay.

4702
02:52:24,730 --> 02:52:26,810
It's all about the experience.

4703
02:52:28,250 --> 02:52:29,630
And I know my team is...

4704
02:52:29,630 --> 02:52:30,290
My teammates got me.

4705
02:52:33,390 --> 02:52:34,430
Got you, dog.

4706
02:52:40,370 --> 02:52:41,610
Waiting for opponent.

4707
02:52:41,970 --> 02:52:43,110
What do you have to pick?

4708
02:52:43,170 --> 02:52:44,670
Get ready for the next battle.

4709
02:52:44,890 --> 02:52:46,050
Probably the stage.

4710
02:52:46,190 --> 02:52:48,030
Waiting for the good random.

4711
02:52:48,530 --> 02:52:49,730
Maybe he was timing it.

4712
02:52:50,010 --> 02:52:51,130
He can time it?

4713
02:52:51,310 --> 02:52:52,910
Oh my god, it's One Punch Man!

4714
02:52:54,070 --> 02:52:55,110
Oh, he's serious now.

4715
02:52:55,110 --> 02:52:55,910
I love One Piece.

4716
02:52:56,290 --> 02:52:57,650
He's actually serious.

4717
02:52:58,110 --> 02:52:58,430
Okay.

4718
02:52:58,770 --> 02:53:00,370
How's that coach staying on, bro?

4719
02:53:00,430 --> 02:53:01,210
Oh my god.

4720
02:53:01,350 --> 02:53:01,810
He's so...

4721
02:53:01,810 --> 02:53:03,230
He's a kicking guy.

4722
02:53:03,330 --> 02:53:05,010
He's actually serious now.

4723
02:53:05,070 --> 02:53:05,890
Yeah, that's true.

4724
02:53:06,030 --> 02:53:07,070
It doesn't make sense.

4725
02:53:07,230 --> 02:53:08,710
And it's not one kick.

4726
02:53:08,850 --> 02:53:09,770
It's a great many.

4727
02:53:10,690 --> 02:53:12,150
He already fucked it up.

4728
02:53:12,270 --> 02:53:13,250
How did he...

4729
02:53:17,390 --> 02:53:18,150
Oh my god.

4730
02:53:18,270 --> 02:53:18,710
I did it.

4731
02:53:18,830 --> 02:53:19,430
I did it.

4732
02:53:20,190 --> 02:53:20,910
So good.

4733
02:53:21,290 --> 02:53:21,730
Yay!

4734
02:53:24,310 --> 02:53:27,290
That roar with the game was synced up on my screen.

4735
02:53:27,290 --> 02:53:28,190
It was very cool.

4736
02:53:28,450 --> 02:53:29,270
I want you to know that.

4737
02:53:29,510 --> 02:53:30,670
Someone clip that, please.

4738
02:53:31,110 --> 02:53:31,790
Oh my god.

4739
02:53:31,790 --> 02:53:33,370
Wait, I think he actually learned though.

4740
02:53:33,490 --> 02:53:33,810
Three.

4741
02:53:34,390 --> 02:53:35,490
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4742
02:53:36,370 --> 02:53:37,130
Okay, okay.

4743
02:53:37,270 --> 02:53:38,630
I should have done more alley kicks.

4744
02:53:38,750 --> 02:53:39,210
It's only hop kick on five.

4745
02:53:39,370 --> 02:53:39,870
It's only hop kick on five.

4746
02:53:39,870 --> 02:53:40,250
Yeah, yeah.

4747
02:53:40,310 --> 02:53:40,710
That's true.

4748
02:53:40,810 --> 02:53:41,250
That's true.

4749
02:53:42,150 --> 02:53:43,590
Yeah, let's go for a grab or something after.

4750
02:53:45,510 --> 02:53:46,370
Oh, he ducks now.

4751
02:53:46,670 --> 02:53:51,010
I think like after what I did to him, he's got... he like learned.

4752
02:53:51,870 --> 02:53:52,470
What a dog.

4753
02:53:52,670 --> 02:53:53,170
It's Shane duck.

4754
02:53:54,710 --> 02:53:55,030
Yes.

4755
02:53:55,070 --> 02:53:56,170
Oh, cooky.

4756
02:53:56,650 --> 02:53:56,970
Yay!

4757
02:53:57,470 --> 02:53:57,790
Boom.

4758
02:53:57,910 --> 02:53:58,250
That's it.

4759
02:53:58,630 --> 02:53:59,010
That's it.

4760
02:53:59,510 --> 02:53:59,830
Nice.

4761
02:53:59,830 --> 02:54:00,110
Nice.

4762
02:54:00,790 --> 02:54:01,230
Nice!

4763
02:54:01,250 --> 02:54:02,250
Oh, you're a legend.

4764
02:54:02,570 --> 02:54:03,710
You're a fucking legend.

4765
02:54:04,610 --> 02:54:05,370
Good shit.

4766
02:54:06,390 --> 02:54:06,830
Fight.

4767
02:54:07,510 --> 02:54:08,390
Unbelievably nuts.

4768
02:54:08,530 --> 02:54:08,930
Oh, shit.

4769
02:54:09,070 --> 02:54:12,090
He doesn't do that thing that abused him last time, you know?

4770
02:54:12,090 --> 02:54:12,390
Remember?

4771
02:54:13,210 --> 02:54:14,170
Yeah, that string.

4772
02:54:14,330 --> 02:54:14,630
Yeah.

4773
02:54:14,790 --> 02:54:18,590
He doesn't do that anymore because I think he got tilted with that.

4774
02:54:19,870 --> 02:54:20,530
Wait, what?

4775
02:54:20,630 --> 02:54:21,170
It didn't hit?

4776
02:54:21,290 --> 02:54:21,450
What?

4777
02:54:21,450 --> 02:54:22,490
The timing was crazy.

4778
02:54:22,730 --> 02:54:23,290
It worked?

4779
02:54:24,430 --> 02:54:25,230
On purpose.

4780
02:54:25,410 --> 02:54:26,070
Oh, what the fuck?

4781
02:54:27,430 --> 02:54:27,870
Okay.

4782
02:54:27,990 --> 02:54:28,990
He was ready for that.

4783
02:54:29,330 --> 02:54:29,770
Yeah.

4784
02:54:31,070 --> 02:54:31,510
Fight.

4785
02:54:33,250 --> 02:54:33,690
Woo!

4786
02:54:35,110 --> 02:54:35,970
Not that one.

4787
02:54:37,030 --> 02:54:38,390
That wasn't actually it?

4788
02:54:40,530 --> 02:54:40,970
What?

4789
02:54:43,070 --> 02:54:43,830
Oh, no.

4790
02:54:43,890 --> 02:54:44,570
He got me.

4791
02:54:45,930 --> 02:54:46,610
Wha... what?

4792
02:54:46,870 --> 02:54:47,890
How does he do that?

4793
02:54:48,490 --> 02:54:49,710
It doesn't give a crap.

4794
02:54:49,810 --> 02:54:50,290
Not with square.

4795
02:54:51,090 --> 02:54:51,530
Oh!

4796
02:54:51,630 --> 02:54:52,010
What do I do?

4797
02:54:52,370 --> 02:54:52,870
Never mind.

4798
02:54:53,730 --> 02:54:54,710
Oh, no.

4799
02:54:56,230 --> 02:54:57,110
Oh, no!

4800
02:54:57,670 --> 02:54:58,190
Nice try.

4801
02:54:58,270 --> 02:54:58,570
Nice try.

4802
02:54:58,610 --> 02:54:58,850
Nice try.

4803
02:54:58,870 --> 02:54:59,350
Good try.

4804
02:54:59,490 --> 02:54:59,530
Good try.

4805
02:54:59,550 --> 02:54:59,810
Nice try.

4806
02:55:00,770 --> 02:55:02,110
He figured me out!

4807
02:55:02,170 --> 02:55:03,610
He downloaded me from yesterday.

4808
02:55:03,890 --> 02:55:04,590
Or two days ago.

4809
02:55:04,890 --> 02:55:05,890
And now we download back!

4810
02:55:05,970 --> 02:55:06,850
Okay, what do I do?

4811
02:55:07,190 --> 02:55:08,670
Now we beat his ass!

4812
02:55:09,670 --> 02:55:10,730
What do I do?

4813
02:55:10,730 --> 02:55:18,610
When he knocks you down, just hold back and get up instead of getting up with a bunch of 1, 2, 3, 4 buttons.

4814
02:55:18,770 --> 02:55:21,870
Just get up with back and just hold back.

4815
02:55:21,930 --> 02:55:22,990
If he knocks you down.

4816
02:55:29,110 --> 02:55:29,930
Oh my god.

4817
02:55:31,050 --> 02:55:32,790
He definitely trained against the king.

4818
02:55:34,790 --> 02:55:36,350
He did not like that.

4819
02:55:38,110 --> 02:55:40,630
Yeah, he definitely played against a lot of kings.

4820
02:55:42,950 --> 02:55:43,690
Good heavens.

4821
02:55:44,830 --> 02:55:45,950
You don't have to get up either.

4822
02:55:46,050 --> 02:55:47,170
You can stay grounded if you want.

4823
02:55:47,250 --> 02:55:47,790
Oh, I should?

4824
02:55:48,250 --> 02:55:48,770
Should I?

4825
02:55:49,710 --> 02:55:50,310
Yeah, yeah.

4826
02:55:50,370 --> 02:55:51,150
Against this guy, yeah.

4827
02:55:52,310 --> 02:55:52,970
I feel like I'm gonna get knocked down.

4828
02:55:52,990 --> 02:55:53,350
I feel like I should.

4829
02:55:53,430 --> 02:55:54,130
Yeah, this guy.

4830
02:55:55,930 --> 02:55:56,370
Oh.

4831
02:56:01,130 --> 02:56:01,570
Yay!

4832
02:56:02,110 --> 02:56:02,910
Oh my gosh.

4833
02:56:03,710 --> 02:56:04,450
Good stuff?

4834
02:56:05,030 --> 02:56:05,870
Oh, what the fuck?

4835
02:56:05,910 --> 02:56:06,570
How did that work?

4836
02:56:06,790 --> 02:56:07,710
How come that didn't work?

4837
02:56:08,210 --> 02:56:09,050
He ducked it.

4838
02:56:10,450 --> 02:56:11,690
He actually ducks?

4839
02:56:12,870 --> 02:56:13,310
Yeah.

4840
02:56:13,530 --> 02:56:14,130
He's mixing it up.

4841
02:56:14,490 --> 02:56:16,910
So you run into him and do the knee to mix it up.

4842
02:56:16,910 --> 02:56:17,170
Okay.

4843
02:56:17,170 --> 02:56:18,070
Remember that running knee.

4844
02:56:18,070 --> 02:56:18,470
Yeah.

4845
02:56:20,390 --> 02:56:20,830
Okay.

4846
02:56:22,990 --> 02:56:23,110
He's black.

4847
02:56:23,290 --> 02:56:23,790
All right.

4848
02:56:23,830 --> 02:56:24,250
Well, it worked.

4849
02:56:24,250 --> 02:56:24,550
Yay!

4850
02:56:25,150 --> 02:56:25,590
That's good.

4851
02:56:27,750 --> 02:56:28,630
Oh no.

4852
02:56:31,130 --> 02:56:32,050
What a break.

4853
02:56:32,350 --> 02:56:32,630
Yup.

4854
02:56:34,850 --> 02:56:35,290
Oh.

4855
02:56:36,350 --> 02:56:36,790
Okay.

4856
02:56:37,270 --> 02:56:37,710
Okay.

4857
02:56:37,770 --> 02:56:38,210
Cooked.

4858
02:56:39,490 --> 02:56:39,930
Yay.

4859
02:56:41,630 --> 02:56:42,470
That's counter hit.

4860
02:56:42,570 --> 02:56:43,350
That's counter hit.

4861
02:56:43,370 --> 02:56:43,930
Oh my god.

4862
02:56:44,490 --> 02:56:45,110
Oh, what?

4863
02:56:45,210 --> 02:56:46,030
Oh, he sidestepped.

4864
02:56:46,230 --> 02:56:46,250
It's okay.

4865
02:56:46,290 --> 02:56:46,970
Focus, focus.

4866
02:56:48,030 --> 02:56:49,490
Oh, he sidestepped me.

4867
02:56:50,630 --> 02:56:51,290
Still alive.

4868
02:56:51,530 --> 02:56:52,290
Did I hit those?

4869
02:56:52,290 --> 02:56:52,670
Yeah!

4870
02:56:52,670 --> 02:56:53,450
Let's fucking go.

4871
02:56:53,490 --> 02:56:54,030
Nice job.

4872
02:56:54,330 --> 02:56:54,550
Yeah!

4873
02:56:55,630 --> 02:56:56,530
Good shit.

4874
02:56:57,130 --> 02:56:58,230
Oh my god.

4875
02:56:58,690 --> 02:56:59,410
I hit it.

4876
02:57:02,570 --> 02:57:03,750
Good shit.

4877
02:57:04,450 --> 02:57:05,750
I hit those.

4878
02:57:10,670 --> 02:57:11,490
Oh, yes.

4879
02:57:13,190 --> 02:57:14,690
Oh, I should...

4880
02:57:14,690 --> 02:57:15,590
I need to do the square.

4881
02:57:16,330 --> 02:57:17,770
Yeah, the square.

4882
02:57:17,990 --> 02:57:18,310
Yeah.

4883
02:57:18,330 --> 02:57:18,990
Because he's a square.

4884
02:57:19,550 --> 02:57:20,090
Yup.

4885
02:57:20,090 --> 02:57:20,330
That's right.

4886
02:57:21,110 --> 02:57:21,870
Oh, he's a square.

4887
02:57:21,990 --> 02:57:22,270
Yup.

4888
02:57:22,270 --> 02:57:22,790
Boom!

4889
02:57:23,210 --> 02:57:23,730
Boom!

4890
02:57:23,730 --> 02:57:26,290
Oh he ducks it now!

4891
02:57:26,430 --> 02:57:27,230
He blocks it!

4892
02:57:27,630 --> 02:57:29,830
You told me nobody blocks this you liar!

4893
02:57:35,390 --> 02:57:36,390
Nice try.

4894
02:57:36,530 --> 02:57:37,330
Is that alright?

4895
02:57:37,790 --> 02:57:39,590
He actually learned from me.

4896
02:57:42,690 --> 02:57:45,910
That's just raw adaptation and a skull necklace.

4897
02:57:46,210 --> 02:57:46,790
That's true.

4898
02:57:46,830 --> 02:57:47,370
That's true.

4899
02:57:47,470 --> 02:57:48,390
He was one punch man.

4900
02:57:48,470 --> 02:57:49,870
How the fuck do I kill that guy?

4901
02:57:50,390 --> 02:57:51,470
I don't think we can.

4902
02:57:51,630 --> 02:57:51,950
Yeah!

4903
02:57:52,210 --> 02:57:52,670
Yeah!

4904
02:57:52,950 --> 02:57:54,110
I'm gonna use the Batdune.

4905
02:57:55,550 --> 02:57:56,830
You got this Kony!

4906
02:57:57,250 --> 02:57:58,650
Do what I couldn't do!

4907
02:57:59,030 --> 02:58:01,910
Wait Doki you have to hit the rage button before you leave.

4908
02:58:01,910 --> 02:58:01,950
I got you.

4909
02:58:03,050 --> 02:58:03,730
Thank you.

4910
02:58:07,250 --> 02:58:08,170
That was fun.

4911
02:58:44,060 --> 02:58:44,940
Let's get it brother.

4912
02:58:48,460 --> 02:58:49,540
I hate this stage.

4913
02:58:51,980 --> 02:58:52,640
It's for you.

4914
02:59:01,180 --> 02:59:02,660
Oh grabs.

4915
02:59:02,920 --> 02:59:03,200
Okay.

4916
02:59:05,700 --> 02:59:06,740
Lots of grabs.

4917
02:59:07,720 --> 02:59:07,720
Okay.

4918
02:59:09,120 --> 02:59:10,140
Do it again.

4919
02:59:10,810 --> 02:59:11,180
Okay.

4920
02:59:13,160 --> 02:59:14,460
Lots of grabs.

4921
02:59:15,140 --> 02:59:17,580
I got it.

4922
02:59:19,660 --> 02:59:20,400
Oh.

4923
02:59:21,980 --> 02:59:22,200
Oh wow.

4924
02:59:22,380 --> 02:59:23,460
Big counter hit.

4925
02:59:24,960 --> 02:59:26,120
What the hell.

4926
02:59:27,620 --> 02:59:28,140
Nice.

4927
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:30,520
Nice.

4928
02:59:30,520 --> 02:59:30,980
Good play.

4929
02:59:35,420 --> 02:59:36,920
That comes back so far.

4930
02:59:37,320 --> 02:59:39,240
You forward 2-1 that if you block that.

4931
02:59:41,900 --> 02:59:42,420
Okay.

4932
02:59:43,680 --> 02:59:44,200
Damn.

4933
02:59:44,420 --> 02:59:45,700
They all train against kings.

4934
02:59:46,600 --> 02:59:47,180
Got it.

4935
02:59:47,300 --> 02:59:48,340
That was sick.

4936
02:59:48,480 --> 02:59:49,000
Wow.

4937
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:49,600
What a swing.

4938
02:59:49,820 --> 02:59:50,360
Nice job.

4939
02:59:50,360 --> 02:59:50,440
Nice job.

4940
02:59:54,960 --> 02:59:56,020
Start off with Kankans.

4941
02:59:58,900 --> 03:00:02,680
My guess is she is starting with Kankans because her coach told her to go the low on Power Crush.

4942
03:00:03,660 --> 03:00:04,800
Do you have them pulled off?

4943
03:00:05,960 --> 03:00:06,360
No.

4944
03:00:06,400 --> 03:00:06,980
Just a guess.

4945
03:00:07,100 --> 03:00:07,380
Okay.

4946
03:00:07,400 --> 03:00:07,560
Okay.

4947
03:00:10,280 --> 03:00:12,100
That would be crazy intelligence.

4948
03:00:12,580 --> 03:00:12,940
Yeah.

4949
03:00:13,860 --> 03:00:15,040
Oh my God.

4950
03:00:15,220 --> 03:00:16,140
Hit her out of that.

4951
03:00:16,240 --> 03:00:16,740
That's crazy.

4952
03:00:18,280 --> 03:00:18,680
Angleslam.

4953
03:00:19,800 --> 03:00:20,200
Nice!

4954
03:00:20,200 --> 03:00:20,660
Nice!

4955
03:00:21,020 --> 03:00:21,180
Fuck!

4956
03:00:21,180 --> 03:00:21,960
I thought she was dead.

4957
03:00:22,120 --> 03:00:22,580
Yeah, shit.

4958
03:00:22,820 --> 03:00:24,040
I didn't press anything.

4959
03:00:24,360 --> 03:00:26,220
Yeah, it's free after angle slam.

4960
03:00:26,740 --> 03:00:28,740
She has Hadouken as well, so be careful.

4961
03:00:29,480 --> 03:00:30,900
No, she lost her heat though.

4962
03:00:30,980 --> 03:00:31,740
She doesn't have heat.

4963
03:00:31,940 --> 03:00:33,680
Oh, I'm looking at the other fucking guy.

4964
03:00:33,740 --> 03:00:33,920
Sorry.

4965
03:00:34,980 --> 03:00:36,700
You're looking at her teammate!

4966
03:00:39,620 --> 03:00:40,820
Oh my god, I punched.

4967
03:00:41,080 --> 03:00:41,460
Alright.

4968
03:00:42,080 --> 03:00:42,620
Got it.

4969
03:00:42,680 --> 03:00:43,060
Nice!

4970
03:00:43,500 --> 03:00:43,920
Jab!

4971
03:00:44,640 --> 03:00:45,380
Jab jab.

4972
03:00:46,180 --> 03:00:51,180
Apparently, so much chat said like, this team actually exclusively trained against Kings.

4973
03:00:51,720 --> 03:00:52,740
That makes sense.

4974
03:00:54,160 --> 03:00:55,560
And where is it getting them?

4975
03:00:55,760 --> 03:00:56,820
Like, let's be real here.

4976
03:00:57,120 --> 03:00:58,340
Oh, how did...

4977
03:00:58,340 --> 03:00:59,120
Oh, nice!

4978
03:00:59,480 --> 03:01:00,700
I know, I didn't think of that in time.

4979
03:01:00,840 --> 03:01:00,980
Doki bird.

4980
03:01:02,380 --> 03:01:03,600
Doki bird special.

4981
03:01:03,960 --> 03:01:06,680
They never trained against this, so...

4982
03:01:09,280 --> 03:01:09,760
Almost.

4983
03:01:10,060 --> 03:01:10,560
Good job.

4984
03:01:11,140 --> 03:01:11,900
Nice quick punish.

4985
03:01:11,900 --> 03:01:12,580
What the fuck?

4986
03:01:12,600 --> 03:01:13,720
Alley kick is free there.

4987
03:01:14,500 --> 03:01:15,280
Alley kick...

4988
03:01:15,380 --> 03:01:16,160
Oh fuck, you're right.

4989
03:01:16,220 --> 03:01:16,500
Sorry.

4990
03:01:17,620 --> 03:01:18,280
Nice job.

4991
03:01:18,360 --> 03:01:18,780
Nice!

4992
03:01:19,060 --> 03:01:19,220
Nice!

4993
03:01:21,140 --> 03:01:21,700
Let's go!

4994
03:01:23,140 --> 03:01:23,580
Yeah!

4995
03:01:25,380 --> 03:01:25,940
Let's go.

4996
03:01:26,100 --> 03:01:28,960
They might have beat my king, but they haven't beat Kony's king.

4997
03:01:31,120 --> 03:01:32,000
Coach Kony!

4998
03:01:32,960 --> 03:01:34,760
You can't download him.

4999
03:01:35,340 --> 03:01:36,400
He's can canning.

5000
03:01:36,420 --> 03:01:37,060
There it is!

5001
03:01:37,480 --> 03:01:37,780
Oh!

5002
03:01:38,260 --> 03:01:38,700
Oh!

5003
03:01:39,720 --> 03:01:41,080
She's scrambling out of block.

5004
03:01:41,300 --> 03:01:43,400
Our beautiful, beautiful patient man.

5005
03:01:44,700 --> 03:01:45,140
Yeah.

5006
03:01:48,540 --> 03:01:49,920
Not a good reaction time.

5007
03:01:50,080 --> 03:01:50,640
No.

5008
03:01:51,120 --> 03:01:51,900
No, no.

5009
03:01:52,540 --> 03:01:55,060
What the fuck I'm talking about dude?

5010
03:01:55,220 --> 03:01:56,100
I remember.

5011
03:01:58,380 --> 03:02:01,840
That was unreal dude.

5012
03:02:05,440 --> 03:02:06,220
That's okay.

5013
03:02:06,300 --> 03:02:06,720
Alley kick?

5014
03:02:06,820 --> 03:02:07,160
Fuck it.

5015
03:02:12,880 --> 03:02:13,440
Nice!

5016
03:02:13,620 --> 03:02:14,240
She's scrambling.

5017
03:02:14,360 --> 03:02:15,080
She's nervous.

5018
03:02:15,360 --> 03:02:16,200
He lost it.

5019
03:02:16,520 --> 03:02:17,160
Just fine.

5020
03:02:17,160 --> 03:02:18,100
The snowballer.

5021
03:02:18,240 --> 03:02:20,360
He looked at the wrong king to train against.

5022
03:02:21,800 --> 03:02:23,080
Oh my god!

5023
03:02:23,240 --> 03:02:23,680
Yeah!

5024
03:02:25,740 --> 03:02:26,180
Grab.

5025
03:02:29,580 --> 03:02:33,080
I was gonna say, because her coach definitely told her to grab first, so...

5026
03:02:33,080 --> 03:02:35,520
I'm expecting grab on run up, but...

5027
03:02:36,220 --> 03:02:37,200
I'm trying too hard.

5028
03:02:37,340 --> 03:02:39,400
Because I feel like she's back there, and I'm trying to chase her.

5029
03:02:39,720 --> 03:02:42,980
You can forward 2-1 that if she blocks that.

5030
03:02:42,980 --> 03:02:43,520
Right, right, right.

5031
03:02:43,640 --> 03:02:43,840
The chase.

5032
03:02:44,220 --> 03:02:45,700
The backflip thingy she had.

5033
03:02:47,800 --> 03:02:49,220
Okay, shiny wizard now.

5034
03:02:49,400 --> 03:02:49,800
Yes!

5035
03:02:50,860 --> 03:02:51,940
All good, all good.

5036
03:02:52,080 --> 03:02:52,280
Nice.

5037
03:02:56,960 --> 03:02:57,360
Good.

5038
03:02:57,980 --> 03:02:58,380
Boom.

5039
03:02:58,920 --> 03:02:59,320
Wall?

5040
03:02:59,520 --> 03:02:59,920
Oh!

5041
03:03:00,940 --> 03:03:01,880
Take her to that wall!

5042
03:03:02,120 --> 03:03:03,040
Guaranteed guaranteed wall.

5043
03:03:03,240 --> 03:03:05,240
5, 6, 7, how long can you go?

5044
03:03:06,860 --> 03:03:07,860
And he'll wake up.

5045
03:03:07,880 --> 03:03:08,760
Do it, do it again, do it again!

5046
03:03:08,920 --> 03:03:09,280
Yeah!

5047
03:03:09,640 --> 03:03:10,040
Dude.

5048
03:03:10,760 --> 03:03:12,280
Alright, just pressure bro.

5049
03:03:12,420 --> 03:03:12,960
Just pressure.

5050
03:03:14,140 --> 03:03:15,800
But he's a real anchor here, man.

5051
03:03:16,160 --> 03:03:17,140
Bro, you should've kept going.

5052
03:03:17,160 --> 03:03:18,180
You should've kept going until she stopped.

5053
03:03:20,160 --> 03:03:21,540
Just keep alley kicking?

5054
03:03:21,840 --> 03:03:22,100
Yes!

5055
03:03:22,120 --> 03:03:23,180
100 alley kicks!

5056
03:03:23,340 --> 03:03:25,000
And plus 1 alley kick.

5057
03:03:25,200 --> 03:03:25,560
Do it again.

5058
03:03:26,520 --> 03:03:27,780
You could've done it.

5059
03:03:28,020 --> 03:03:29,040
Nice job, nice job.

5060
03:03:29,460 --> 03:03:30,700
Alright, freaky Jin time.

5061
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:33,240
I taught him that.

5062
03:03:33,360 --> 03:03:34,560
I taught him the alley kick.

5063
03:03:46,400 --> 03:03:47,440
Well, slime.

5064
03:03:48,420 --> 03:03:49,480
It's your turn.

5065
03:03:50,100 --> 03:03:51,360
Get me in there.

5066
03:03:51,800 --> 03:03:53,320
Well, Coney also has to...

5067
03:03:53,320 --> 03:03:54,940
Yeah, there it is.

5068
03:03:55,280 --> 03:03:55,720
Alright.

5069
03:03:57,700 --> 03:03:58,320
Here we go.

5070
03:03:59,560 --> 03:04:00,320
Oh man.

5071
03:04:00,720 --> 03:04:05,240
Can you imagine if this was a Street Fighter slam and like the team had like 3 Zangiefs?

5072
03:04:05,420 --> 03:04:06,100
Yeah, right?

5073
03:04:06,360 --> 03:04:06,480
It's so goofy.

5074
03:04:06,780 --> 03:04:08,160
That team would lose.

5075
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:10,380
Badly.

5076
03:04:10,580 --> 03:04:11,400
Yeah, exactly.

5077
03:04:11,460 --> 03:04:13,080
Is that like the King equivalent?

5078
03:04:13,960 --> 03:04:15,120
No, he's a grappler.

5079
03:04:15,160 --> 03:04:16,920
He's a grappler in Street Fighter.

5080
03:04:18,140 --> 03:04:19,240
Actually, I don't know.

5081
03:04:19,260 --> 03:04:23,380
I feel like low level Zangief, especially on Modern, like a Guile's not gonna know what to do.

5082
03:04:23,720 --> 03:04:25,600
Like a first week Guile, you know what I mean?

5083
03:04:25,620 --> 03:04:25,700
Yeah, yeah.

5084
03:04:27,340 --> 03:04:28,560
Same stage as last time.

5085
03:04:28,640 --> 03:04:29,040
It's fun.

5086
03:04:29,040 --> 03:04:30,120
Tell them to get a Street Fighter.

5087
03:04:30,140 --> 03:04:31,020
Three Hondas would fu..

5088
03:04:31,020 --> 03:04:31,940
Yeah, Honda is a better.

5089
03:04:32,040 --> 03:04:35,280
Honda would fuck people up in a Street Fighter slam.

5090
03:04:35,360 --> 03:04:37,800
That character is annoying if you're new.

5091
03:04:38,520 --> 03:04:39,560
Round 1.

5092
03:04:39,840 --> 03:04:40,740
Good shit.

5093
03:04:42,020 --> 03:04:42,960
Make a presence.

5094
03:04:43,260 --> 03:04:43,580
Nice.

5095
03:04:46,360 --> 03:04:47,280
Download him.

5096
03:04:50,300 --> 03:04:50,820
Here

5097
03:04:53,910 --> 03:04:54,430
we go.

5098
03:04:54,770 --> 03:04:56,570
I was gonna die.

5099
03:04:56,810 --> 03:04:57,030
I was gonna die.

5100
03:04:57,030 --> 03:04:57,310
Really?

5101
03:04:57,310 --> 03:04:57,750
Oh no.

5102
03:04:57,890 --> 03:04:58,470
He's gonna die.

5103
03:04:58,470 --> 03:04:58,670
Oh!

5104
03:05:05,330 --> 03:05:06,850
I mean, do that butt this works.

5105
03:05:09,710 --> 03:05:10,590
Close though!

5106
03:05:11,030 --> 03:05:12,770
I didn't think I'd launch on that.

5107
03:05:13,010 --> 03:05:14,650
The butt would have been guaranteed.

5108
03:05:20,180 --> 03:05:20,920
Oh, nice.

5109
03:05:27,990 --> 03:05:28,790
Look at the chip.

5110
03:05:29,010 --> 03:05:29,450
Jesus!

5111
03:05:29,450 --> 03:05:30,330
Oh, jeez!

5112
03:05:33,090 --> 03:05:33,530
Wow.

5113
03:05:43,210 --> 03:05:43,650
Wow.

5114
03:05:44,430 --> 03:05:45,410
He got up wrong.

5115
03:05:45,450 --> 03:05:46,390
I thought he knew it.

5116
03:05:48,010 --> 03:05:48,450
Nice!

5117
03:05:49,510 --> 03:05:49,950
Fight!

5118
03:05:55,990 --> 03:05:56,670
Oh, God.

5119
03:05:56,770 --> 03:05:57,610
That was a fun test then.

5120
03:06:01,490 --> 03:06:02,250
Smack him.

5121
03:06:04,650 --> 03:06:05,110
Okay.

5122
03:06:05,350 --> 03:06:06,970
That was good punish by that guy.

5123
03:06:07,070 --> 03:06:07,090
Makes sense.

5124
03:06:07,090 --> 03:06:07,330
Makes sense.

5125
03:06:10,490 --> 03:06:11,250
Nice job.

5126
03:06:18,590 --> 03:06:19,490
Is that a troop?

5127
03:06:20,050 --> 03:06:20,510
Yeah.

5128
03:06:20,930 --> 03:06:21,390
Wow.

5129
03:06:21,590 --> 03:06:22,050
That's...

5130
03:06:22,650 --> 03:06:23,450
Oh, my God.

5131
03:06:24,330 --> 03:06:26,250
He has the main character buff.

5132
03:06:26,430 --> 03:06:27,030
That's not fair.

5133
03:06:31,870 --> 03:06:33,670
Why does this fucking launch?

5134
03:06:33,690 --> 03:06:34,510
What is this shit?

5135
03:06:38,180 --> 03:06:38,580
Listen.

5136
03:06:44,240 --> 03:06:44,640
He's also using fight.

5137
03:06:44,640 --> 03:06:45,220
I'm trying to do it.

5138
03:06:45,260 --> 03:06:47,880
He's doing this to one four and it's like that.

5139
03:06:48,060 --> 03:06:49,200
Hi, mid mid.

5140
03:06:49,280 --> 03:06:50,480
It's like two punches on a kick.

5141
03:06:50,780 --> 03:06:52,140
He keeps counter hitting you.

5142
03:06:52,260 --> 03:06:52,640
That's it.

5143
03:06:53,660 --> 03:06:54,060
No.

5144
03:06:54,660 --> 03:06:55,700
If he delays it.

5145
03:06:55,740 --> 03:06:55,860
Yeah.

5146
03:06:56,740 --> 03:06:58,380
But he's not delaying it.

5147
03:06:59,520 --> 03:06:59,920
Round.

5148
03:07:00,280 --> 03:07:00,680
One.

5149
03:07:01,580 --> 03:07:01,980
Fight.

5150
03:07:09,150 --> 03:07:09,550
That.

5151
03:07:09,550 --> 03:07:09,770
That move.

5152
03:07:09,950 --> 03:07:10,470
Yeah, that.

5153
03:07:17,340 --> 03:07:17,700
Oh!

5154
03:07:18,240 --> 03:07:19,060
I'm bad, I'm bad.

5155
03:07:20,220 --> 03:07:21,180
Sorry, you'll get used to it.

5156
03:07:28,750 --> 03:07:29,670
He plays like a bot.

5157
03:07:29,850 --> 03:07:32,090
Like a fucking AI made to play games online.

5158
03:07:32,190 --> 03:07:33,590
This is what I said, remember two days ago?

5159
03:07:33,630 --> 03:07:36,570
He just plays like the most regular Tekken you've ever fucking seen.

5160
03:07:37,170 --> 03:07:39,330
Yeah, so like he takes it really slow, right?

5161
03:07:40,130 --> 03:07:40,890
Yeah, he's not...

5162
03:07:41,350 --> 03:07:42,130
doing it a lot.

5163
03:07:42,730 --> 03:07:43,090
Nice!

5164
03:07:43,610 --> 03:07:44,230
Nice punish.

5165
03:07:44,550 --> 03:07:44,910
Yeah.

5166
03:07:47,290 --> 03:07:47,730
Oh!

5167
03:07:47,730 --> 03:07:49,010
That's what we're talking about, baby!

5168
03:07:49,130 --> 03:07:50,050
Oh, guaranteed.

5169
03:07:50,190 --> 03:07:50,630
That's crazy.

5170
03:07:51,030 --> 03:07:51,470
Nice!

5171
03:07:52,470 --> 03:07:53,730
All good, you got a big lead.

5172
03:07:57,590 --> 03:07:58,450
Oh my god!

5173
03:07:58,590 --> 03:07:59,430
What a timing.

5174
03:08:03,810 --> 03:08:04,250
What?

5175
03:08:08,090 --> 03:08:09,590
Dude, I hate this fucking combo.

5176
03:08:11,670 --> 03:08:13,070
Remember, you have a heat.

5177
03:08:13,210 --> 03:08:15,270
Just burst if it's like the end of the round.

5178
03:08:16,030 --> 03:08:16,470
Yeah.

5179
03:08:18,810 --> 03:08:20,730
How does that fucking happen, dude?

5180
03:08:21,570 --> 03:08:22,510
I'm holding back.

5181
03:08:22,690 --> 03:08:23,430
I'm just gonna...

5182
03:08:26,420 --> 03:08:26,860
Alright,

5183
03:08:30,200 --> 03:08:30,600
good start.

5184
03:08:31,560 --> 03:08:32,860
1, 4, 2...

5185
03:08:33,460 --> 03:08:34,480
I'm breaking these.

5186
03:08:36,140 --> 03:08:37,400
I knew I was gonna die here.

5187
03:08:37,880 --> 03:08:38,820
God, what a bot.

5188
03:08:39,100 --> 03:08:39,340
Ugh.

5189
03:08:40,240 --> 03:08:41,880
I'll be a nice person in real life.

5190
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:42,880
I fucking hope so.

5191
03:08:44,520 --> 03:08:45,600
I think so.

5192
03:08:45,760 --> 03:08:46,340
I think so.

5193
03:08:46,880 --> 03:08:47,460
Sean's late.

5194
03:08:47,540 --> 03:08:47,860
Sean's late.

5195
03:08:47,900 --> 03:08:48,240
Sean's late.

5196
03:08:48,240 --> 03:08:49,140
But Jen is strong.

5197
03:08:50,340 --> 03:08:52,580
No, no... I'm just not blocking.

5198
03:08:52,920 --> 03:08:54,060
I'm just fucking terrible.

5199
03:08:55,980 --> 03:08:58,320
He gave you a lot of cookies he whipped...

5200
03:08:58,320 --> 03:08:59,720
a few times.

5201
03:09:00,280 --> 03:09:00,780
Okay.

5202
03:09:01,080 --> 03:09:02,060
It's okay, Matt.

5203
03:09:02,200 --> 03:09:03,520
Matt takes it home for us.

5204
03:09:03,620 --> 03:09:05,100
Okay, I'm actually losing this one.

5205
03:09:05,200 --> 03:09:12,320
I'm not even kidding- This is the most random fucking play I've ever played in my life.

5206
03:09:12,320 --> 03:09:15,360
Jesus, a religion started because of him!

5207
03:09:16,740 --> 03:09:18,220
Oh, no, no.

5208
03:09:21,600 --> 03:09:23,000
You're the only one who can!

5209
03:09:48,480 --> 03:09:49,620
What the fuck?

5210
03:09:49,700 --> 03:09:51,100
I'm speed... oh my god, zoom!

5211
03:09:51,740 --> 03:09:53,080
Oh, interesting.

5212
03:09:53,500 --> 03:09:54,400
What the fuck?

5213
03:09:55,040 --> 03:09:55,640
Brrrr!

5214
03:09:56,400 --> 03:09:57,000
Brrrr!

5215
03:10:00,900 --> 03:10:01,800
Let's get it.

5216
03:10:01,880 --> 03:10:03,080
New in-chain song.

5217
03:10:10,790 --> 03:10:12,430
Oh my god.

5218
03:10:13,730 --> 03:10:14,490
What's cool?

5219
03:10:17,040 --> 03:10:18,240
That's the meta lead.

5220
03:10:23,300 --> 03:10:23,900
Fuck.

5221
03:10:24,320 --> 03:10:24,880
Whoa.

5222
03:10:31,900 --> 03:10:33,080
How do I turn the end?

5223
03:10:33,200 --> 03:10:33,660
What happened in history?

5224
03:10:37,160 --> 03:10:37,600
L2.

5225
03:10:41,480 --> 03:10:41,920
Thanks.

5226
03:10:42,720 --> 03:10:43,340
No way.

5227
03:10:50,520 --> 03:10:50,960
Nice.

5228
03:10:53,360 --> 03:10:53,800
Yeah!

5229
03:10:57,100 --> 03:10:58,520
What the fuck happened to my armor?

5230
03:10:59,280 --> 03:11:00,640
You pressed, you had to hold it.

5231
03:11:00,960 --> 03:11:01,400
Fuck.

5232
03:11:04,820 --> 03:11:07,480
Nah, I mean, I should have canceled it in public.

5233
03:11:08,200 --> 03:11:09,240
It didn't come out.

5234
03:11:10,400 --> 03:11:11,520
It's alright, GOAT.

5235
03:11:11,580 --> 03:11:12,100
It's alright.

5236
03:11:12,260 --> 03:11:13,000
It's okay, it's okay.

5237
03:11:13,260 --> 03:11:14,040
Just one set.

5238
03:11:14,360 --> 03:11:17,080
A lot of these strings have these highs in them.

5239
03:11:17,500 --> 03:11:19,140
That if you knew about them, you could...

5240
03:11:19,530 --> 03:11:21,760
Like her 1-1, her 10 frame punish is a high high.

5241
03:11:22,820 --> 03:11:24,820
Also, there's two hits that go into chainsaws.

5242
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:25,400
She only...

5243
03:11:25,400 --> 03:11:27,420
Well, I mean, I can't explain it now, but...

5244
03:11:27,420 --> 03:11:28,920
Just know there are gaps.

5245
03:11:33,800 --> 03:11:34,420
Good block.

5246
03:11:42,480 --> 03:11:43,800
Oh my god, I hate this guy.

5247
03:11:45,080 --> 03:11:46,060
Wow, again.

5248
03:11:46,900 --> 03:11:49,040
Yeah, let's bait out the hopkick then.

5249
03:11:51,860 --> 03:11:52,420
Boom.

5250
03:11:52,720 --> 03:11:53,280
Nice.

5251
03:11:55,140 --> 03:11:56,460
What is that move?

5252
03:11:57,240 --> 03:11:58,720
I know, fuck Alyssa.

5253
03:11:58,920 --> 03:12:00,400
I hate playing against Jade.

5254
03:12:01,520 --> 03:12:02,080
Okay.

5255
03:12:05,380 --> 03:12:06,180
Let's get it.

5256
03:12:06,500 --> 03:12:07,060
Nice.

5257
03:12:09,600 --> 03:12:10,160
Big.

5258
03:12:10,160 --> 03:12:10,580
Nice.

5259
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:11,600
Big hit.

5260
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:13,780
Take your chance.

5261
03:12:13,800 --> 03:12:14,280
Let's get to the more.

5262
03:12:18,140 --> 03:12:19,440
Oh, he doesn't know.

5263
03:12:19,560 --> 03:12:20,040
Nice.

5264
03:12:20,180 --> 03:12:20,540
Yes.

5265
03:12:22,940 --> 03:12:24,120
That string, that's a high.

5266
03:12:24,200 --> 03:12:24,700
Okay.

5267
03:12:26,380 --> 03:12:27,900
I literally just don't know the string.

5268
03:12:28,940 --> 03:12:29,440
Nice.

5269
03:12:29,940 --> 03:12:31,680
Last hit on the board.

5270
03:12:32,260 --> 03:12:33,700
Not close at all.

5271
03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:37,720
Oh, what the fuck, man.

5272
03:12:47,440 --> 03:12:48,720
What the fuck this character?

5273
03:12:50,260 --> 03:12:57,080
I mean that's green but even... Even this, this is gonna scale too cause Alyssa's always in the air.

5274
03:12:57,480 --> 03:12:58,420
Wait, really?

5275
03:12:59,200 --> 03:12:59,980
That's crazy.

5276
03:13:00,460 --> 03:13:01,280
That's so dumb.

5277
03:13:04,840 --> 03:13:05,360
Nice!

5278
03:13:05,360 --> 03:13:06,240
Oh nice!

5279
03:13:06,740 --> 03:13:07,600
Also in the air.

5280
03:13:08,340 --> 03:13:09,320
What the fuck?

5281
03:13:09,640 --> 03:13:10,320
Uh oh.

5282
03:13:10,520 --> 03:13:11,200
Uh oh.

5283
03:13:12,360 --> 03:13:13,440
Wait what happened?

5284
03:13:13,640 --> 03:13:14,920
I tried to blast off.

5285
03:13:16,120 --> 03:13:17,540
The patriot fist?

5286
03:13:18,840 --> 03:13:21,400
Okay yeah if I'm not doing this then I'm not doing well.

5287
03:13:28,960 --> 03:13:30,760
Oh it's over for me Burrows.

5288
03:13:31,840 --> 03:13:32,320
No!

5289
03:13:33,640 --> 03:13:34,780
I feel it.

5290
03:13:35,560 --> 03:13:36,740
You turned us around!

5291
03:13:46,440 --> 03:13:47,660
I'm dead bro.

5292
03:13:47,960 --> 03:13:48,640
Yeah yeah.

5293
03:13:48,780 --> 03:13:49,980
Good try man.

5294
03:13:50,220 --> 03:13:50,720
I made it.

5295
03:13:50,960 --> 03:13:51,820
Nooo let's try.

5296
03:13:52,200 --> 03:13:52,640
You know what?

5297
03:13:52,720 --> 03:13:54,040
We got the loss out of the way.

5298
03:13:54,160 --> 03:13:55,500
We got it out of the way.

5299
03:13:55,640 --> 03:13:57,120
You like this kind of stuff.

5300
03:13:57,160 --> 03:14:01,200
Like this team hard trained against us so it makes sense you know.

5301
03:14:05,860 --> 03:14:10,420
Although the streak is over, that gives us a chance to start a new streak.

5302
03:14:10,720 --> 03:14:11,320
That's right.

5303
03:14:11,440 --> 03:14:12,100
A better one.

5304
03:14:12,100 --> 03:14:12,580
There it is.

5305
03:14:12,780 --> 03:14:13,780
There it is.

5306
03:14:13,880 --> 03:14:15,040
It was even longer.

5307
03:14:15,320 --> 03:14:15,700
Yeah.

5308
03:14:16,380 --> 03:14:17,460
And then look at this shit.

5309
03:14:17,500 --> 03:14:18,560
Another fucking Alyssa.

5310
03:14:18,800 --> 03:14:20,820
It's gonna go all the way to Evo.

5311
03:14:22,440 --> 03:14:23,280
Makes you think.

5312
03:14:25,760 --> 03:14:27,120
I can't believe it.

5313
03:14:27,180 --> 03:14:28,820
They went anti-team BP.

5314
03:14:30,340 --> 03:14:34,340
I mean they did that last time too after we won the round robin.

5315
03:14:34,340 --> 03:14:35,640
That's so fucked up.

5316
03:14:36,100 --> 03:14:37,040
That's true chat.

5317
03:14:37,240 --> 03:14:38,660
Jack Jesus fell on Friday.

5318
03:14:38,680 --> 03:14:39,840
He will rise on Sunday.

5319
03:14:40,020 --> 03:14:40,560
Oh true!

5320
03:14:42,020 --> 03:14:43,440
It is the Lord's day.

5321
03:14:43,660 --> 03:14:44,700
It is the Lord's day.

5322
03:14:45,180 --> 03:14:46,940
He died for our sins guys.

5323
03:14:47,480 --> 03:14:49,400
The two round robins probably hurt us more.

5324
03:14:49,560 --> 03:14:51,660
Cause this happened to us last time but...

5325
03:14:52,260 --> 03:14:53,260
Round one.

5326
03:14:54,300 --> 03:14:54,800
Fight.

5327
03:14:55,480 --> 03:14:56,300
Good shit.

5328
03:14:56,460 --> 03:14:57,020
Ooh this is...

5329
03:14:58,800 --> 03:14:59,340
Ooh.

5330
03:14:59,460 --> 03:14:59,900
Ooh.

5331
03:14:59,900 --> 03:15:00,840
He is so fast.

5332
03:15:01,120 --> 03:15:02,960
Coach you need to train us for this team.

5333
03:15:08,010 --> 03:15:08,550
Jesus.

5334
03:15:08,930 --> 03:15:09,470
Oh my god.

5335
03:15:17,470 --> 03:15:18,010
Okay.

5336
03:15:18,430 --> 03:15:19,150
Good shit.

5337
03:15:19,190 --> 03:15:19,250
Yes sir.

5338
03:15:20,130 --> 03:15:21,050
Hell yeah brother.

5339
03:15:21,610 --> 03:15:21,790
That's one.

5340
03:15:21,790 --> 03:15:24,550
Come on coach you're better.

5341
03:15:25,630 --> 03:15:26,170
Ooh.

5342
03:15:26,610 --> 03:15:27,530
We busted.

5343
03:15:27,750 --> 03:15:27,770
Round two.

5344
03:15:28,570 --> 03:15:29,110
Fight.

5345
03:15:29,830 --> 03:15:30,790
What am I doing?

5346
03:15:32,830 --> 03:15:34,310
We're having lots of fun.

5347
03:15:34,630 --> 03:15:35,110
Exactly.

5348
03:15:37,530 --> 03:15:39,130
Oh look at her life dude.

5349
03:15:39,150 --> 03:15:39,730
Look at the wall.

5350
03:15:39,930 --> 03:15:40,430
Oh no.

5351
03:15:40,470 --> 03:15:41,410
Oh my god.

5352
03:15:41,470 --> 03:15:41,990
Did we send another?

5353
03:15:42,390 --> 03:15:43,430
Oh my god.

5354
03:15:43,490 --> 03:15:43,730
Do it again.

5355
03:15:44,010 --> 03:15:44,230
Ouch.

5356
03:15:45,890 --> 03:15:46,370
Boom.

5357
03:15:48,070 --> 03:15:48,550
Boom.

5358
03:15:50,430 --> 03:15:51,670
Let's go baby.

5359
03:15:52,110 --> 03:15:52,210
Again.

5360
03:15:52,210 --> 03:15:52,550
Again.

5361
03:15:59,080 --> 03:16:00,560
A bench match.

5362
03:16:00,580 --> 03:16:01,540
Oh my goodness.

5363
03:16:01,640 --> 03:16:02,260
You are crazy.

5364
03:16:02,300 --> 03:16:02,780
Dude.

5365
03:16:03,420 --> 03:16:03,800
Yep.

5366
03:16:03,820 --> 03:16:04,180
Yep.

5367
03:16:04,180 --> 03:16:04,560
Yep.

5368
03:16:04,640 --> 03:16:04,820
Yep.

5369
03:16:04,920 --> 03:16:05,000
Yep.

5370
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:05,920
Oh my god.

5371
03:16:05,920 --> 03:16:06,800
All those blocks.

5372
03:16:06,960 --> 03:16:07,420
Boom.

5373
03:16:08,140 --> 03:16:10,700
One day my coach will teach me how to block.

5374
03:16:14,700 --> 03:16:15,900
My one weakness.

5375
03:16:16,560 --> 03:16:17,460
Oh wow.

5376
03:16:17,540 --> 03:16:18,100
What a fucking.

5377
03:16:18,680 --> 03:16:19,260
Let's go.

5378
03:16:19,660 --> 03:16:20,960
Hey teach me the Alyssa match up.

5379
03:16:21,360 --> 03:16:22,480
What the fuck?

5380
03:16:23,260 --> 03:16:25,320
Yeah we'll work on the Alyssa match up like tonight.

5381
03:16:25,580 --> 03:16:26,400
Uncle Baptist.

5382
03:16:26,800 --> 03:16:27,420
You win.

5383
03:16:27,720 --> 03:16:30,020
That was pretty good.

5384
03:16:30,140 --> 03:16:30,660
That was pretty good.

5385
03:16:30,940 --> 03:16:31,500
You know.

5386
03:16:31,660 --> 03:16:34,640
I think it's cause like Bravo didn't coach Matt.

5387
03:16:34,640 --> 03:16:36,020
That was the issue.

5388
03:16:36,300 --> 03:16:37,120
I did it.

5389
03:16:37,340 --> 03:16:38,180
I fucking did it.

5390
03:16:38,180 --> 03:16:38,960
No no no no no no.

5391
03:16:39,040 --> 03:16:39,460
You coached me on that.

5392
03:16:39,460 --> 03:16:40,720
No he didn't help him at all.

5393
03:16:40,900 --> 03:16:42,360
He didn't help our team.

5394
03:16:42,380 --> 03:16:43,220
He didn't help our team.

5395
03:16:43,220 --> 03:16:44,100
He didn't help us at all.

5396
03:16:44,120 --> 03:16:45,720
I didn't get shit for Alyssa.

5397
03:16:45,800 --> 03:16:46,060
Exactly.

5398
03:16:46,060 --> 03:16:46,580
I did that myself.

5399
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:48,020
You didn't help him at all bro.

5400
03:16:48,020 --> 03:16:50,040
You clearly knew how to counter Alyssa.

5401
03:16:50,440 --> 03:16:52,480
I literally didn't get any Alyssa coaching.

5402
03:16:52,740 --> 03:16:53,280
I'm not anything.

5403
03:16:54,560 --> 03:16:55,700
I went into replay.

5404
03:16:55,880 --> 03:16:57,080
I was like oh this is punishable.

5405
03:16:57,160 --> 03:16:57,560
Good to know.

5406
03:16:57,600 --> 03:16:57,960
And then I closed it.

5407
03:16:57,960 --> 03:17:00,180
He purposely did that Matt so he could look good.

5408
03:17:00,200 --> 03:17:01,440
And compared to you.

5409
03:17:02,800 --> 03:17:03,200
I'm not even kidding.

5410
03:17:03,200 --> 03:17:04,220
I'm not even kidding.

5411
03:17:04,800 --> 03:17:05,520
Wait what?

5412
03:17:05,600 --> 03:17:06,040
What is this?

5413
03:17:06,060 --> 03:17:06,340
Oh my god.

5414
03:17:06,340 --> 03:17:07,100
They swapped.

5415
03:17:07,420 --> 03:17:07,620
Oh.

5416
03:17:07,800 --> 03:17:09,200
They're not doing Alyssa anymore.

5417
03:17:09,940 --> 03:17:10,460
Jun Kazama.

5418
03:17:10,460 --> 03:17:11,180
Round one.

5419
03:17:12,180 --> 03:17:12,700
Fight.

5420
03:17:13,120 --> 03:17:13,560
Whoa.

5421
03:17:18,660 --> 03:17:20,280
I was not expecting this.

5422
03:17:21,560 --> 03:17:23,240
We were all training for Alyssa.

5423
03:17:31,920 --> 03:17:33,020
Okay let's not.

5424
03:17:33,100 --> 03:17:34,280
In case we don't press after that.

5425
03:17:36,120 --> 03:17:37,280
You got two scores.

5426
03:17:43,800 --> 03:17:44,560
He's back.

5427
03:17:44,600 --> 03:17:44,720
He's back.

5428
03:17:44,740 --> 03:17:44,900
Round two.

5429
03:17:45,860 --> 03:17:46,380
Fight.

5430
03:17:55,430 --> 03:17:55,950
Nice.

5431
03:18:00,070 --> 03:18:00,590
Oh.

5432
03:18:01,790 --> 03:18:03,090
Take him to the wall.

5433
03:18:06,750 --> 03:18:07,470
Oh god.

5434
03:18:07,910 --> 03:18:08,430
Nice.

5435
03:18:08,810 --> 03:18:09,290
Oh.

5436
03:18:23,710 --> 03:18:24,590
Jesus Christ.

5437
03:18:24,610 --> 03:18:25,330
Oh my god.

5438
03:18:26,550 --> 03:18:27,330
Push her back.

5439
03:18:27,350 --> 03:18:27,650
Oh my god.

5440
03:18:27,690 --> 03:18:28,310
This is it.

5441
03:18:28,390 --> 03:18:29,190
The back turn.

5442
03:18:29,230 --> 03:18:29,470
Yeah.

5443
03:18:29,510 --> 03:18:30,030
Push her back.

5444
03:18:30,050 --> 03:18:31,230
I love that kick.

5445
03:18:31,310 --> 03:18:32,030
That's funny.

5446
03:18:32,130 --> 03:18:33,530
That's funny that he has that.

5447
03:18:33,650 --> 03:18:34,130
Yeah.

5448
03:18:34,230 --> 03:18:35,590
Like a specific back turn.

5449
03:18:35,690 --> 03:18:35,890
Yeah.

5450
03:18:37,630 --> 03:18:39,050
What the fuck?

5451
03:18:39,350 --> 03:18:39,870
Okay.

5452
03:18:40,650 --> 03:18:42,090
That was her throw break.

5453
03:18:42,350 --> 03:18:44,150
She tried the throw break but it whiffed.

5454
03:18:57,550 --> 03:18:58,330
Let's get it.

5455
03:18:58,410 --> 03:18:59,330
Let's get it.

5456
03:19:02,850 --> 03:19:04,230
I'm gonna see it soon guys.

5457
03:19:04,510 --> 03:19:04,850
You got so much health back.

5458
03:19:04,910 --> 03:19:05,350
Oh.

5459
03:19:05,790 --> 03:19:06,770
I saw it.

5460
03:19:06,870 --> 03:19:07,370
Oh.

5461
03:19:07,690 --> 03:19:08,210
Oh.

5462
03:19:08,210 --> 03:19:08,570
That's it.

5463
03:19:08,710 --> 03:19:08,850
Oh.

5464
03:19:09,010 --> 03:19:09,370
That was.

5465
03:19:09,510 --> 03:19:10,630
You stepped it?

5466
03:19:11,370 --> 03:19:11,990
You can.

5467
03:19:12,110 --> 03:19:13,850
He got nerfed but I didn't.

5468
03:19:13,890 --> 03:19:14,830
My punish didn't go through.

5469
03:19:15,590 --> 03:19:16,070
Oh.

5470
03:19:16,070 --> 03:19:17,190
They made it to the second.

5471
03:19:17,230 --> 03:19:18,310
His isn't tracking anymore.

5472
03:19:18,450 --> 03:19:19,190
Oh my god.

5473
03:19:19,350 --> 03:19:19,770
What?

5474
03:19:22,210 --> 03:19:25,790
Round four.

5475
03:19:26,110 --> 03:19:26,930
He's scared of the grab.

5476
03:19:27,150 --> 03:19:27,550
Fight.

5477
03:19:30,490 --> 03:19:31,170
Knee loops.

5478
03:19:33,310 --> 03:19:33,790
Nice.

5479
03:19:34,110 --> 03:19:35,110
Oh my goodness.

5480
03:19:35,270 --> 03:19:36,110
Oh my god.

5481
03:19:36,150 --> 03:19:36,910
It doesn't stop.

5482
03:19:37,070 --> 03:19:37,470
Oh it stopped.

5483
03:19:37,890 --> 03:19:39,110
I'm feeling justice here.

5484
03:19:39,270 --> 03:19:39,510
Ay.

5485
03:19:39,510 --> 03:19:39,850
Ay.

5486
03:19:39,970 --> 03:19:40,810
I'm feeling justice here.

5487
03:19:40,830 --> 03:19:41,010
I'm feeling justice.

5488
03:19:42,530 --> 03:19:43,790
I sense it in my bones.

5489
03:19:44,030 --> 03:19:44,430
Yup.

5490
03:19:44,910 --> 03:19:45,310
Ay.

5491
03:19:46,230 --> 03:19:46,630
Justice.

5492
03:19:48,570 --> 03:19:49,390
Oh my god.

5493
03:19:49,630 --> 03:19:50,070
Good shit.

5494
03:19:50,530 --> 03:19:51,610
What a confident win.

5495
03:19:51,610 --> 03:19:52,150
Good shit.

5496
03:19:52,490 --> 03:19:53,410
That was confident.

5497
03:19:53,410 --> 03:19:53,790
I think.

5498
03:19:53,990 --> 03:19:54,390
Dude.

5499
03:19:54,530 --> 03:19:55,770
That's actually a big win.

5500
03:19:55,930 --> 03:19:57,010
Cause it's us and them between.

5501
03:19:57,110 --> 03:19:57,870
For top two.

5502
03:19:58,130 --> 03:19:59,250
And now we're even.

5503
03:19:59,570 --> 03:19:59,970
Yeah.

5504
03:19:59,990 --> 03:20:00,390
Yeah.

5505
03:20:00,390 --> 03:20:00,590
Yeah.

5506
03:20:00,590 --> 03:20:01,170
Is that real?

5507
03:20:01,390 --> 03:20:01,950
Is that true?

5508
03:20:02,570 --> 03:20:02,970
Yeah.

5509
03:20:03,010 --> 03:20:03,870
Tony's number one.

5510
03:20:03,950 --> 03:20:04,330
Uh.

5511
03:20:04,510 --> 03:20:05,570
As far as I know.

5512
03:20:05,710 --> 03:20:06,250
Let me see.

5513
03:20:06,930 --> 03:20:07,490
Oh no.

5514
03:20:07,530 --> 03:20:08,610
I got them mixed up with uh.

5515
03:20:08,730 --> 03:20:09,130
MYK.

5516
03:20:10,830 --> 03:20:10,990
Yeah.

5517
03:20:10,990 --> 03:20:11,350
I was gonna say.

5518
03:20:11,350 --> 03:20:12,050
What about MYK?

5519
03:20:12,250 --> 03:20:12,530
Yeah.

5520
03:20:13,330 --> 03:20:13,950
That's still big.

5521
03:20:14,030 --> 03:20:14,390
That's still big.

5522
03:20:14,790 --> 03:20:17,110
I haven't got MYK and KFM switched up.

5523
03:20:17,190 --> 03:20:17,510
But still.

5524
03:20:17,830 --> 03:20:19,750
You just need to do well at MYK.

5525
03:20:20,430 --> 03:20:21,630
Then we're good to go.

5526
03:20:23,870 --> 03:20:24,510
Oh man.

5527
03:20:24,610 --> 03:20:25,490
He beat me last time.

5528
03:20:25,730 --> 03:20:27,310
I don't even know who's gonna lose.

5529
03:20:27,310 --> 03:20:28,430
Honestly I think this was sabotage for Mattman.

5530
03:20:30,470 --> 03:20:32,850
If this was tournament you just lost.

5531
03:20:33,150 --> 03:20:33,810
What does that mean?

5532
03:20:34,590 --> 03:20:35,130
I thought.

5533
03:20:35,150 --> 03:20:35,890
I thought they lost.

5534
03:20:37,930 --> 03:20:38,770
What's she saying?

5535
03:20:39,070 --> 03:20:39,670
I don't know.

5536
03:20:39,790 --> 03:20:39,870
No.

5537
03:20:39,910 --> 03:20:40,710
It was 3-2.

5538
03:20:40,730 --> 03:20:40,810
It was 3-2.

5539
03:20:40,810 --> 03:20:42,670
Dude that was a coach tiebreaker wasn't it?

5540
03:20:42,850 --> 03:20:43,250
Yeah.

5541
03:20:43,350 --> 03:20:43,590
For the.

5542
03:20:43,630 --> 03:20:44,030
Yeah.

5543
03:20:44,030 --> 03:20:44,310
Yeah.

5544
03:20:44,510 --> 03:20:45,690
No we would've won that.

5545
03:20:45,750 --> 03:20:46,630
It was a coach tiebreaker.

5546
03:20:46,670 --> 03:20:47,990
I don't know what they're talking about but okay.

5547
03:20:48,310 --> 03:20:49,990
No cause I won second round.

5548
03:20:50,190 --> 03:20:50,410
Yeah.

5549
03:20:50,410 --> 03:20:50,830
So we.

5550
03:20:51,690 --> 03:20:52,570
Yeah that wouldn't happen.

5551
03:20:52,810 --> 03:20:53,470
I don't know.

5552
03:20:53,570 --> 03:20:53,850
Whatever.

5553
03:20:54,090 --> 03:20:54,410
Yay.

5554
03:20:54,870 --> 03:20:55,430
Ah dude.

5555
03:20:56,290 --> 03:20:56,690
Woo.

5556
03:20:57,410 --> 03:20:57,810
Alright.

5557
03:20:57,950 --> 03:20:58,290
Good shit.

5558
03:20:58,590 --> 03:21:00,270
I don't think Alyssa players can do math.

5559
03:21:00,370 --> 03:21:00,990
That's what I'm saying.

5560
03:21:08,320 --> 03:21:09,240
One more uh.

5561
03:21:09,660 --> 03:21:10,700
One more round fellas.

5562
03:21:12,220 --> 03:21:13,020
Wait they won?

5563
03:21:13,020 --> 03:21:13,700
One two three two?

5564
03:21:13,840 --> 03:21:14,240
Oh nevermind.

5565
03:21:14,300 --> 03:21:17,420
Wait oh no yeah cause like slime me and Matt.

5566
03:21:19,020 --> 03:21:20,260
It's 2-3.

5567
03:21:20,940 --> 03:21:21,720
It's 2-3.

5568
03:21:21,720 --> 03:21:22,440
We're not.

5569
03:21:22,540 --> 03:21:24,420
We're not used to Matt losing.

5570
03:21:26,580 --> 03:21:28,280
This is sabotage.

5571
03:21:28,360 --> 03:21:28,760
We just assume he won.

5572
03:21:29,060 --> 03:21:32,920
If only Bra Pro taught Matt how to fade against Alyssa.

5573
03:21:33,760 --> 03:21:37,440
The only matchup that I literally don't know the matchup.

5574
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:40,720
Damn the teams are pretty even.

5575
03:21:41,100 --> 03:21:41,620
That's.

5576
03:21:41,760 --> 03:21:42,280
Wow.

5577
03:21:42,480 --> 03:21:43,000
The king of the matchup.

5578
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:43,500
The king.

5579
03:21:43,500 --> 03:21:46,280
Someone in my chat was like the king players don't know how to do math.

5580
03:21:46,780 --> 03:21:47,700
So true.

5581
03:21:47,880 --> 03:21:48,180
It's true.

5582
03:21:48,300 --> 03:21:48,920
They're hating.

5583
03:21:49,100 --> 03:21:51,100
I mean that's not what their specialty is.

5584
03:21:51,180 --> 03:21:51,400
Yeah.

5585
03:21:51,540 --> 03:21:51,980
We are.

5586
03:21:52,100 --> 03:21:53,060
We're here to crap.

5587
03:21:53,340 --> 03:21:53,580
I think he is 3 -teens.

5588
03:22:04,060 --> 03:22:05,720
Alright one more set fellas.

5589
03:22:05,840 --> 03:22:07,120
One more set.

5590
03:22:09,200 --> 03:22:10,120
Yes sir.

5591
03:22:24,110 --> 03:22:24,630
No.

5592
03:22:26,590 --> 03:22:28,390
Gonna watch myself lose them all.

5593
03:22:28,390 --> 03:22:29,110
I don't like it from yesterday.

5594
03:22:29,510 --> 03:22:31,050
Let's see what I can do.

5595
03:22:31,450 --> 03:22:32,850
Yeah, learn from it.

5596
03:22:32,930 --> 03:22:34,170
I believe in you, coach.

5597
03:23:03,870 --> 03:23:04,770
It's okay, guys.

5598
03:23:04,870 --> 03:23:06,270
This is just round robin, guys.

5599
03:23:06,490 --> 03:23:07,250
It doesn't matter.

5600
03:23:07,550 --> 03:23:09,350
The finals is when it matters.

5601
03:23:09,850 --> 03:23:12,910
The finals is when we're gonna fucking kill everybody.

5602
03:23:13,630 --> 03:23:16,370
It's not our fault everybody trained against us.

5603
03:23:19,110 --> 03:23:20,930
Like, that's so fucked up.

5604
03:23:21,030 --> 03:23:23,150
Why did everybody hard train against me?

5605
03:23:23,530 --> 03:23:25,270
I don't know what I'm doing.

5606
03:23:25,450 --> 03:23:28,270
I'm fucking brute forcing my way into this tournament.

5607
03:23:32,710 --> 03:23:33,290
Yay!

5608
03:23:36,130 --> 03:23:36,710
True.

5609
03:23:39,390 --> 03:23:41,390
Why are you training against me?

5610
03:23:44,410 --> 03:23:46,210
It might have been your shot.

5611
03:23:46,430 --> 03:23:47,570
Yeah, but it's working.

5612
03:23:47,850 --> 03:23:48,310
Yeah.

5613
03:23:49,010 --> 03:23:50,110
But like...

5614
03:23:50,110 --> 03:23:52,170
But like, it's not our fault.

5615
03:23:52,510 --> 03:23:53,810
I can't believe...

5616
03:23:53,810 --> 03:23:55,450
I can't believe people train against us.

5617
03:23:55,670 --> 03:23:57,090
That's actually so fucked up.

5618
03:23:58,930 --> 03:24:00,750
That's actually so fucked up.

5619
03:24:02,670 --> 03:24:04,090
I don't know what I'm doing.

5620
03:24:04,150 --> 03:24:06,490
The fact that he trained against a King player...

5621
03:24:07,190 --> 03:24:10,190
It like, perfectly countered me because he knew...

5622
03:24:10,190 --> 03:24:13,690
He knew I only had very limited set of moves.

5623
03:24:15,030 --> 03:24:17,630
Wait until you master another move.

5624
03:24:17,630 --> 03:24:21,670
I can't believe they Vaude Reviewed.

5625
03:24:22,390 --> 03:24:24,090
I didn't Vaude Review...

5626
03:24:24,090 --> 03:24:25,470
I just learn new moves.

5627
03:24:31,330 --> 03:24:33,750
It's time to learn an eighth...

5628
03:24:33,750 --> 03:24:34,770
A seventh move.

5629
03:24:34,930 --> 03:24:35,410
You're right.

5630
03:24:35,550 --> 03:24:37,490
I just have to learn a seventh move chat.

5631
03:24:40,850 --> 03:24:42,110
That's all I need to do.

5632
03:24:44,330 --> 03:24:45,110
Oh shit.

5633
03:24:45,610 --> 03:24:46,470
Oh shit.

5634
03:24:47,490 --> 03:24:48,010
Oh...

5635
03:24:49,670 --> 03:24:50,890
I just need to learn.

5636
03:24:51,350 --> 03:24:52,190
Oh shit!

5637
03:24:52,290 --> 03:24:52,550
No!

5638
03:24:52,870 --> 03:24:53,430
No!

5639
03:24:53,490 --> 03:24:54,650
I pressed the wrong button!

5640
03:24:55,290 --> 03:24:56,150
That's okay!

5641
03:24:56,330 --> 03:24:57,390
It doesn't matter!

5642
03:24:58,830 --> 03:25:00,310
Because I'm... Oh okay!

5643
03:25:00,510 --> 03:25:02,190
Because I'm gonna grab her!

5644
03:25:03,570 --> 03:25:03,990
Yay!

5645
03:25:05,070 --> 03:25:07,610
Three kings in the leading team.

5646
03:25:07,930 --> 03:25:09,150
It's just messed up!

5647
03:25:09,610 --> 03:25:10,870
It's so messed up.

5648
03:25:11,010 --> 03:25:14,490
Okay, I hate playing against this girl because this girl is anti-grab.

5649
03:25:15,210 --> 03:25:16,290
It's actually crazy.

5650
03:25:19,510 --> 03:25:21,830
Like I can't do the tamaha kick with her.

5651
03:25:22,410 --> 03:25:22,830
See?

5652
03:25:24,730 --> 03:25:26,170
But I can abuse this.

5653
03:25:28,770 --> 03:25:29,190
Yay!

5654
03:25:32,070 --> 03:25:33,090
Just ally kick.

5655
03:25:33,270 --> 03:25:33,570
I know!

5656
03:25:33,650 --> 03:25:34,290
That's what I did.

5657
03:25:37,810 --> 03:25:38,550
Oh shit!

5658
03:25:38,670 --> 03:25:40,030
I didn't expect her to do that.

5659
03:25:40,770 --> 03:25:42,150
I didn't expect you to do that.

5660
03:25:42,790 --> 03:25:43,610
Oh my god!

5661
03:25:43,650 --> 03:25:44,930
You low kick this?

5662
03:25:45,990 --> 03:25:47,030
How do I get out?

5663
03:25:48,750 --> 03:25:50,890
She got most of her HP back!

5664
03:25:52,810 --> 03:25:55,630
They always fall for the ally kick because it's so stupid.

5665
03:25:59,850 --> 03:26:01,430
It's so fucking stupid.

5666
03:26:01,690 --> 03:26:04,310
I'd fall for it because of how dumb it is.

5667
03:26:04,790 --> 03:26:05,290
Like...

5668
03:26:07,650 --> 03:26:09,070
It's just so dumb.

5669
03:26:13,910 --> 03:26:15,650
Nobody expects it.

5670
03:26:17,030 --> 03:26:18,310
It works every time.

5671
03:26:18,470 --> 03:26:22,250
This is why I won and done because they realize I only know a specific set of moves.

5672
03:26:22,550 --> 03:26:24,290
Get ready for the next battle.

5673
03:26:24,690 --> 03:26:26,110
But because it's so low tier...

5674
03:26:26,110 --> 03:26:26,230
Yeah!

5675
03:26:26,770 --> 03:26:27,970
It's so low!

5676
03:26:29,150 --> 03:26:31,250
It's so low!

5677
03:26:32,590 --> 03:26:35,830
Nobody preps... nobody expects it.

5678
03:26:38,530 --> 03:26:39,850
That's so true.

5679
03:26:43,370 --> 03:26:44,570
Nobody expects...

5680
03:26:44,570 --> 03:26:45,850
It's so low!

5681
03:26:46,250 --> 03:26:46,550
It's so low!

5682
03:26:46,870 --> 03:26:49,970
It's so

5683
03:26:55,660 --> 03:26:56,120
low!

5684
03:26:56,440 --> 03:26:57,680
Alright, here we go.

5685
03:26:59,080 --> 03:26:59,680
Come on.

5686
03:26:59,840 --> 03:27:00,940
Oh my god, she has a gun!

5687
03:27:02,360 --> 03:27:03,420
I'm gonna fucking kill her.

5688
03:27:03,500 --> 03:27:04,000
She has a gun.

5689
03:27:04,380 --> 03:27:05,240
Oh no!

5690
03:27:06,120 --> 03:27:06,900
Oh no!

5691
03:27:08,700 --> 03:27:10,080
Fucking free chiropractor.

5692
03:27:11,880 --> 03:27:12,320
Yay!

5693
03:27:14,180 --> 03:27:14,940
Oh shit!

5694
03:27:16,040 --> 03:27:16,700
Not yay.

5695
03:27:16,820 --> 03:27:17,680
Not yay anymore, guys.

5696
03:27:17,760 --> 03:27:18,520
Not yay anymore, guys.

5697
03:27:18,580 --> 03:27:19,120
Not yay anymore.

5698
03:27:19,120 --> 03:27:20,640
Guys, it's not yay anymore.

5699
03:27:21,080 --> 03:27:24,520
Guys, she kicks... she... she doesn't stand up.

5700
03:27:25,120 --> 03:27:25,900
Yo, slide.

5701
03:27:28,780 --> 03:27:30,200
Does she sidestep this?

5702
03:27:30,320 --> 03:27:30,420
No.

5703
03:27:31,300 --> 03:27:32,200
What's up, is it ready?

5704
03:27:32,800 --> 03:27:33,280
No.

5705
03:27:33,920 --> 03:27:34,800
What's up, what's up?

5706
03:27:35,500 --> 03:27:38,540
Dude, this is pretty stressful, man.

5707
03:27:38,680 --> 03:27:42,560
It's not gonna be easy to do this stuff you just learned yesterday the next day.

5708
03:27:43,500 --> 03:27:45,460
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

5709
03:27:45,640 --> 03:27:47,480
Yeah, fuck the Jhin, man.

5710
03:27:47,540 --> 03:27:48,560
It's just like...

5711
03:27:48,560 --> 03:27:49,440
Yes, definitely.

5712
03:27:49,660 --> 03:27:50,920
He's an annoying character, yeah.

5713
03:27:51,480 --> 03:27:51,860
100%.

5714
03:27:51,860 --> 03:27:53,840
I think that I was...

5715
03:27:53,840 --> 03:27:54,660
Oh my gosh, she countered that?

5716
03:27:55,560 --> 03:27:58,200
I was just really trying to focus on defense, which is like...

5717
03:27:58,620 --> 03:27:59,340
Oh my god, I went to bed.

5718
03:27:59,340 --> 03:28:01,400
If you're wrong when you're defending, it's really bad.

5719
03:28:01,560 --> 03:28:04,040
If you're wrong when you're attacking, I feel like it's way more...

5720
03:28:04,040 --> 03:28:04,380
Goodbye!

5721
03:28:04,560 --> 03:28:05,220
... at this level.

5722
03:28:07,020 --> 03:28:09,400
Yeah, you would duck and he would launch...

5723
03:28:09,400 --> 03:28:10,380
Goodbye to me, I guess.

5724
03:28:10,480 --> 03:28:12,040
... that forward 3, that axe kick he has.

5725
03:28:12,280 --> 03:28:14,740
Yeah, and he was also doing it like kind of raw.

5726
03:28:14,940 --> 03:28:17,060
Like I would go for a grab and he'd just rip it.

5727
03:28:17,060 --> 03:28:18,140
And I'm like, okay, well if like...

5728
03:28:18,140 --> 03:28:18,820
It just works.

5729
03:28:19,180 --> 03:28:20,260
... he'll block a little more.

5730
03:28:20,480 --> 03:28:20,840
That's not much.

5731
03:28:21,120 --> 03:28:22,560
Because they don't expect it.

5732
03:28:22,580 --> 03:28:23,000
So I don't know.

5733
03:28:23,080 --> 03:28:24,500
I don't know how much of it was like...

5734
03:28:24,500 --> 03:28:26,160
They just don't expect it.

5735
03:28:26,340 --> 03:28:27,040
... this guy's goaded or this guy's like...

5736
03:28:27,960 --> 03:28:28,680
He's alright.

5737
03:28:28,920 --> 03:28:29,240
He's alright.

5738
03:28:29,380 --> 03:28:30,080
I played him a little bit.

5739
03:28:30,080 --> 03:28:33,100
And I think he was taking some rounds off of me yesterday, was it?

5740
03:28:34,000 --> 03:28:37,220
I think he said that about the Feng Wei, who also destroyed me.

5741
03:28:38,120 --> 03:28:38,960
So I just gotta...

5742
03:28:38,960 --> 03:28:39,460
Those guys are...

5743
03:28:39,460 --> 03:28:40,220
... getting in your gear, man.

5744
03:28:40,220 --> 03:28:43,240
Honestly, I don't think they should even be in this tier.

5745
03:28:43,640 --> 03:28:44,900
The Feng, specifically.

5746
03:28:46,220 --> 03:28:46,580
But...

5747
03:28:46,580 --> 03:28:47,040
Yeah.

5748
03:28:47,620 --> 03:28:48,340
This is cool.

5749
03:28:48,440 --> 03:28:51,900
I mean, we can watch them like tonight or tomorrow if you want the matches.

5750
03:28:52,200 --> 03:28:52,340
Yay.

5751
03:28:52,380 --> 03:28:53,380
If it helps you.

5752
03:28:55,320 --> 03:28:59,020
I think what will help is actually playing.

5753
03:28:59,280 --> 03:29:01,060
Like play your Jhin or something.

5754
03:29:01,940 --> 03:29:02,160
Yeah.

5755
03:29:02,160 --> 03:29:04,120
I can definitely play Jhin to that level for sure.

5756
03:29:04,120 --> 03:29:04,860
I don't expect it.

5757
03:29:04,860 --> 03:29:05,540
I told you.

5758
03:29:06,400 --> 03:29:07,040
It's fine.

5759
03:29:07,140 --> 03:29:08,060
Yeah, that's what will help.

5760
03:29:08,120 --> 03:29:08,760
We can do that too.

5761
03:29:08,920 --> 03:29:09,820
I think that could be beneficial.

5762
03:29:09,820 --> 03:29:11,000
If I lose this, it's fine.

5763
03:29:11,080 --> 03:29:11,920
I made a statement.

5764
03:29:11,940 --> 03:29:12,740
She hates me.

5765
03:29:13,080 --> 03:29:14,300
I might have like...

5766
03:29:14,300 --> 03:29:17,040
If I lose this, I might have lost the game.

5767
03:29:17,040 --> 03:29:19,940
But like I want the mental warfare.

5768
03:29:20,160 --> 03:29:20,320
I got no context.

5769
03:29:20,320 --> 03:29:20,780
The way you said that.

5770
03:29:20,820 --> 03:29:21,120
I will...

5771
03:29:21,120 --> 03:29:22,940
It sounds like it's actually happening.

5772
03:29:23,560 --> 03:29:26,980
The way you said it, the tone of the voice.

5773
03:29:29,920 --> 03:29:31,800
I won the mental war.

5774
03:29:31,920 --> 03:29:32,800
It's all about exactly.

5775
03:29:33,260 --> 03:29:34,760
She's going to remember this forever.

5776
03:29:35,400 --> 03:29:36,300
Like the fucking...

5777
03:29:38,200 --> 03:29:38,720
Okay.

5778
03:29:41,020 --> 03:29:44,400
You know she's going to fucking remember this forever.

5779
03:29:44,400 --> 03:29:45,500
You know that.

5780
03:29:52,460 --> 03:29:53,640
The low kick.

5781
03:29:54,480 --> 03:29:57,100
Nothing dying to a low kick.

5782
03:29:57,620 --> 03:29:58,780
And I leave.

5783
03:30:02,420 --> 03:30:03,020
Exactly.

5784
03:30:08,180 --> 03:30:13,460
Imagine if that person has been grinding all her life to be in red rank and here I show up.

5785
03:30:13,460 --> 03:30:15,920
I show up and all I do is this.

5786
03:30:16,220 --> 03:30:16,620
Wait...

5787
03:30:16,620 --> 03:30:16,960
Not that.

5788
03:30:17,180 --> 03:30:17,840
That's sick.

5789
03:30:17,900 --> 03:30:18,620
How do I do that?

5790
03:30:26,860 --> 03:30:27,900
That's Mao Xi.

5791
03:30:28,080 --> 03:30:28,400
That's me.

5792
03:30:32,120 --> 03:30:32,720
That's me.

5793
03:30:38,840 --> 03:30:39,800
Two touched him.

5794
03:30:40,040 --> 03:30:41,500
Fucking two touched him.

5795
03:30:41,520 --> 03:30:42,140
That's so funny.

5796
03:30:44,660 --> 03:30:45,340
Oh shit.

5797
03:30:48,320 --> 03:30:49,060
Oh my god.

5798
03:30:49,080 --> 03:30:50,360
I tried to block but it didn't work.

5799
03:30:52,360 --> 03:30:53,080
Jesus Christ.

5800
03:30:58,090 --> 03:30:58,690
Does he duck?

5801
03:30:58,950 --> 03:30:59,310
Okay.

5802
03:30:59,350 --> 03:30:59,850
He doesn't duck.

5803
03:30:59,950 --> 03:31:00,170
Okay.

5804
03:31:00,570 --> 03:31:01,410
That's all that matter.

5805
03:31:02,430 --> 03:31:04,050
I just need to know if he ducks or not.

5806
03:31:06,470 --> 03:31:08,490
You're cooking this boosh in a little bit.

5807
03:31:09,050 --> 03:31:09,450
Oh no.

5808
03:31:09,910 --> 03:31:11,410
Fucking two touched in the first game.

5809
03:31:11,410 --> 03:31:12,150
Oh he blocks this.

5810
03:31:12,230 --> 03:31:13,330
There's no way he doesn't.

5811
03:31:13,330 --> 03:31:14,870
He's not that stupid.

5812
03:31:15,030 --> 03:31:15,490
He's in.

5813
03:31:15,790 --> 03:31:17,170
He's not that stupid.

5814
03:31:17,870 --> 03:31:19,630
Oh the charge was crazy.

5815
03:31:21,590 --> 03:31:22,790
Oh my god.

5816
03:31:22,870 --> 03:31:24,210
He tried to sidestep that.

5817
03:31:25,170 --> 03:31:26,550
But he fucked it up.

5818
03:31:27,970 --> 03:31:29,350
And he fucked that up.

5819
03:31:30,070 --> 03:31:32,210
I feel bad for Fii not having his character.

5820
03:31:32,430 --> 03:31:37,210
Brother, a lot of these characters play differently than they used to in 7 anyways.

5821
03:31:38,070 --> 03:31:38,590
Yay!

5822
03:31:38,710 --> 03:31:42,070
And Fii is literally using fucking the evil champ character.

5823
03:31:42,270 --> 03:31:42,990
He'll be fine.

5824
03:31:43,190 --> 03:31:43,310
Nice.

5825
03:31:43,330 --> 03:31:44,150
He'll be alright.

5826
03:31:44,650 --> 03:31:45,590
Is he done now?

5827
03:31:45,690 --> 03:31:46,110
Nope.

5828
03:31:46,150 --> 03:31:46,770
He's probably best at three.

5829
03:31:46,970 --> 03:31:47,450
Yay!

5830
03:31:47,730 --> 03:31:48,330
Anything can happen.

5831
03:31:49,350 --> 03:31:49,830
Yay!

5832
03:31:51,770 --> 03:31:52,250
Oh.

5833
03:31:52,470 --> 03:31:52,950
Nevermind.

5834
03:31:53,130 --> 03:31:53,630
Not yay.

5835
03:31:56,030 --> 03:31:56,510
Yay!

5836
03:31:59,150 --> 03:32:00,550
It just works.

5837
03:32:00,670 --> 03:32:02,570
You walked away from him.

5838
03:32:02,690 --> 03:32:03,070
Yeah.

5839
03:32:03,070 --> 03:32:03,730
I'm embarrassed.

5840
03:32:03,910 --> 03:32:05,050
He's a fucking weird guy.

5841
03:32:10,910 --> 03:32:11,550
Oh wait.

5842
03:32:11,650 --> 03:32:11,950
What?

5843
03:32:12,250 --> 03:32:13,170
That doesn't hit!

5844
03:32:13,270 --> 03:32:13,310
Oh.

5845
03:32:13,770 --> 03:32:14,990
No more yays!

5846
03:32:15,130 --> 03:32:16,430
No more yays!

5847
03:32:17,830 --> 03:32:18,570
Leave me alone!

5848
03:32:18,790 --> 03:32:19,490
I'm sorry!

5849
03:32:25,230 --> 03:32:26,790
No more yays.

5850
03:32:31,740 --> 03:32:33,360
Steve's counter hit back one of his as main.

5851
03:32:33,640 --> 03:32:35,740
Oh this guy would die if he backed 1 plus 2 HP.

5852
03:32:35,800 --> 03:32:36,500
That's 1 plus 2.

5853
03:32:36,640 --> 03:32:37,160
Oh shit.

5854
03:32:37,340 --> 03:32:38,360
If you can find an opening.

5855
03:32:38,380 --> 03:32:38,720
Oh shit.

5856
03:32:38,800 --> 03:32:39,160
Please.

5857
03:32:39,480 --> 03:32:40,240
Please let me live.

5858
03:32:41,100 --> 03:32:41,940
Please let me live.

5859
03:32:42,300 --> 03:32:43,120
Oh my god.

5860
03:32:43,160 --> 03:32:43,320
Please.

5861
03:32:44,420 --> 03:32:44,780
Please.

5862
03:32:44,800 --> 03:32:45,820
I blocked it.

5863
03:32:45,860 --> 03:32:46,360
Oh thank god.

5864
03:32:46,860 --> 03:32:47,980
He doesn't duck.

5865
03:32:48,640 --> 03:32:49,320
What?

5866
03:32:50,720 --> 03:32:52,380
You said not duck!

5867
03:32:53,140 --> 03:32:55,380
You haven't done that guard break setup today.

5868
03:32:55,500 --> 03:32:56,740
No I haven't.

5869
03:32:56,740 --> 03:32:57,380
No!

5870
03:32:57,980 --> 03:32:58,660
It's okay.

5871
03:32:58,660 --> 03:33:00,100
This is why we leave too.

5872
03:33:00,660 --> 03:33:00,820
Might as well go for it.

5873
03:33:01,800 --> 03:33:03,060
He ducked.

5874
03:33:03,600 --> 03:33:05,260
I can't believe it.

5875
03:33:05,520 --> 03:33:08,080
He actually ducked.

5876
03:33:08,660 --> 03:33:11,500
He doesn't duck until he does.

5877
03:33:11,860 --> 03:33:12,760
Alright guys.

5878
03:33:13,000 --> 03:33:13,540
Guys.

5879
03:33:13,600 --> 03:33:14,400
This time.

5880
03:33:14,400 --> 03:33:16,020
This time we are going to use this move.

5881
03:33:16,840 --> 03:33:18,700
One day we will be able to use this one.

5882
03:33:19,020 --> 03:33:20,760
We are going to be able to use this one.

5883
03:33:21,520 --> 03:33:21,920
No.

5884
03:33:21,940 --> 03:33:22,260
Okay.

5885
03:33:22,480 --> 03:33:23,140
This one.

5886
03:33:23,260 --> 03:33:23,440
No.

5887
03:33:23,540 --> 03:33:23,880
Okay.

5888
03:33:23,960 --> 03:33:25,360
I am going to be able to do that soon.

5889
03:33:26,500 --> 03:33:27,620
Game is over.

5890
03:33:28,260 --> 03:33:29,020
Brother the controller.

5891
03:33:29,020 --> 03:33:29,300
Alright.

5892
03:33:29,460 --> 03:33:30,060
They gave us a lobby.

5893
03:33:31,360 --> 03:33:31,760
Alright.

5894
03:33:33,100 --> 03:33:34,340
Wait I am in a game.

5895
03:33:34,360 --> 03:33:34,640
Oh shit.

5896
03:33:34,640 --> 03:33:36,320
No I am being nice because he is winning now.

5897
03:33:36,640 --> 03:33:37,040
Okay.

5898
03:33:37,160 --> 03:33:38,420
He is being nice to you?

5899
03:33:38,820 --> 03:33:39,220
No.

5900
03:33:40,140 --> 03:33:41,680
They will never see it coming.

5901
03:33:42,060 --> 03:33:44,260
Oh is this a motion?

5902
03:33:44,340 --> 03:33:44,380
Oh.

5903
03:33:44,400 --> 03:33:44,560
It is a motion match.

5904
03:33:44,760 --> 03:33:45,680
Wait what rank is he?

5905
03:33:45,840 --> 03:33:46,280
I see through his lies.

5906
03:33:48,560 --> 03:33:48,960
16?

5907
03:33:52,160 --> 03:33:53,360
I got this one.

5908
03:33:53,580 --> 03:33:54,060
You want me?

5909
03:33:54,740 --> 03:33:55,140
Um.

5910
03:33:55,240 --> 03:33:55,620
Okay.

5911
03:33:56,620 --> 03:33:57,200
Oh my god.

5912
03:33:57,200 --> 03:33:57,860
He actually ducks.

5913
03:33:59,640 --> 03:34:00,040
Okay.

5914
03:34:00,200 --> 03:34:00,760
Oh it is Doki.

5915
03:34:00,960 --> 03:34:01,840
Maybe she is AFK.

5916
03:34:03,120 --> 03:34:03,520
No.

5917
03:34:03,680 --> 03:34:04,800
I am in a game.

5918
03:34:06,060 --> 03:34:06,460
No.

5919
03:34:06,900 --> 03:34:07,720
I am sorry.

5920
03:34:08,060 --> 03:34:08,360
Don't worry.

5921
03:34:08,420 --> 03:34:08,980
I will lose fast.

5922
03:34:09,480 --> 03:34:11,260
I am going to let him have his elo.

5923
03:34:11,460 --> 03:34:11,780
Okay.

5924
03:34:13,000 --> 03:34:13,400
Okay.

5925
03:34:13,760 --> 03:34:13,900
Okay.

5926
03:34:14,260 --> 03:34:14,380
Okay.

5927
03:34:15,260 --> 03:34:15,920
Oh my god.

5928
03:34:15,940 --> 03:34:16,440
This guy actually...

5929
03:34:17,840 --> 03:34:18,760
Oh my god.

5930
03:34:21,040 --> 03:34:22,200
I am in a game.

5931
03:34:22,480 --> 03:34:22,980
Don't worry.

5932
03:34:23,040 --> 03:34:23,580
I am going to lose fast.

5933
03:34:24,880 --> 03:34:25,920
It will be done soon.

5934
03:34:29,040 --> 03:34:31,080
Because that guy is beating the shit out of me right now.

5935
03:34:33,920 --> 03:34:35,460
Oh Josh skipped Golem.

5936
03:34:36,860 --> 03:34:37,380
Oh yeah.

5937
03:34:37,640 --> 03:34:38,720
He is for this.

5938
03:34:39,120 --> 03:34:39,680
No no no.

5939
03:34:39,800 --> 03:34:41,380
He is just going to skip a lot while you are...

5940
03:34:42,000 --> 03:34:42,800
Oh okay okay.

5941
03:34:43,520 --> 03:34:43,880
Oh.

5942
03:34:44,000 --> 03:34:44,360
Oh.

5943
03:34:44,880 --> 03:34:45,280
Oh.

5944
03:34:45,920 --> 03:34:46,320
Oh.

5945
03:34:50,810 --> 03:34:51,210
Fight.

5946
03:34:51,730 --> 03:34:51,910
Oh.

5947
03:34:58,620 --> 03:34:59,880
Who is this Lucian?

5948
03:35:00,320 --> 03:35:01,660
Is that who Matt has to play?

5949
03:35:03,920 --> 03:35:06,960
Who is that Jhin player?

5950
03:35:07,160 --> 03:35:07,920
Oh is that a TO?

5951
03:35:08,900 --> 03:35:09,300
Who?

5952
03:35:10,700 --> 03:35:12,620
There is a Lucian Jhin player in the lobby.

5953
03:35:12,820 --> 03:35:13,560
They got leaked again?

5954
03:35:13,900 --> 03:35:14,300
No.

5955
03:35:15,460 --> 03:35:16,960
I think it is the TO.

5956
03:35:17,380 --> 03:35:17,720
Oh.

5957
03:35:18,660 --> 03:35:19,640
Oh that is Steve.

5958
03:35:19,960 --> 03:35:21,380
Oh that is tasty Steve.

5959
03:35:22,040 --> 03:35:22,440
Wait.

5960
03:35:22,580 --> 03:35:22,800
Wait.

5961
03:35:22,900 --> 03:35:23,300
Jhin?

5962
03:35:23,400 --> 03:35:23,500
Jhin?

5963
03:35:23,520 --> 03:35:24,880
I thought he played King.

5964
03:35:26,500 --> 03:35:27,280
That is fine.

5965
03:35:27,300 --> 03:35:28,620
He shows you how good Jhin is.

5966
03:35:29,240 --> 03:35:31,280
I lost on purpose so I can get in.

5967
03:35:33,280 --> 03:35:34,580
I say that also.

5968
03:35:36,560 --> 03:35:37,140
Don't worry.

5969
03:35:37,220 --> 03:35:39,240
My chat knows it is right.

5970
03:35:39,320 --> 03:35:39,880
It is true.

5971
03:35:44,160 --> 03:35:45,240
It is true chat.

5972
03:35:45,520 --> 03:35:46,580
I lost on purpose.

5973
03:35:51,890 --> 03:35:52,850
Throwing for content.

5974
03:35:53,150 --> 03:35:53,350
This guy is lagging as shit.

5975
03:35:55,910 --> 03:35:57,070
We are starting.

5976
03:35:57,910 --> 03:35:58,710
Yeah yeah yeah.

5977
03:35:58,710 --> 03:35:59,730
Almost done.

5978
03:35:59,850 --> 03:36:01,450
No we are actually in the game.

5979
03:36:01,830 --> 03:36:02,850
Oh fuck.

5980
03:36:04,370 --> 03:36:06,230
Getting ready for the match.

5981
03:36:08,950 --> 03:36:10,610
We are in in.

5982
03:36:11,630 --> 03:36:11,930
Fuck.

5983
03:36:13,110 --> 03:36:16,050
I am late for my daughter's piano recital.

5984
03:36:17,650 --> 03:36:19,190
He doesn't care.

5985
03:36:20,990 --> 03:36:22,130
I am going to make it.

5986
03:36:22,130 --> 03:36:23,510
Now I am going to lose for real.

5987
03:36:23,950 --> 03:36:26,370
I lost because they weren't all there.

5988
03:36:27,330 --> 03:36:28,690
Keep looking to the stage.

5989
03:36:28,710 --> 03:36:28,890
They are careful.

5990
03:36:28,910 --> 03:36:29,390
Don't say.

5991
03:36:30,510 --> 03:36:31,110
Watch.

5992
03:36:34,390 --> 03:36:37,170
I threw the game because I was so sad.

5993
03:36:37,750 --> 03:36:39,270
Not because I am bad.

5994
03:36:41,590 --> 03:36:43,570
Cook our friend g lament.

5995
03:36:43,830 --> 03:36:45,050
Okay don't say that.

5996
03:36:45,170 --> 03:36:45,770
stressed.

5997
03:36:50,970 --> 03:36:52,510
Oh my God.

5998
03:36:53,810 --> 03:36:54,950
What is this.

5999
03:36:55,310 --> 03:36:55,530
What is this.

6000
03:36:56,730 --> 03:36:58,030
It is you say.

6001
03:36:58,030 --> 03:37:00,330
When you're getting hit like that, you just... Oh, is that?

6002
03:37:00,470 --> 03:37:01,010
That's not opponent.

6003
03:37:01,230 --> 03:37:01,430
No.

6004
03:37:02,090 --> 03:37:03,870
When you get hit like that, just hold back.

6005
03:37:04,170 --> 03:37:07,110
Just hold... Wait, is that... I can't tell if it's lower mid.

6006
03:37:07,470 --> 03:37:11,090
They're... Those were sword slashes for mids.

6007
03:37:11,090 --> 03:37:11,710
Oh, okay.

6008
03:37:16,150 --> 03:37:17,190
Couldn't tell sometimes.

6009
03:37:18,830 --> 03:37:19,310
Nice.

6010
03:37:19,310 --> 03:37:19,710
Okay.

6011
03:37:20,510 --> 03:37:21,230
Good start.

6012
03:37:21,890 --> 03:37:23,190
Oh, she ducks!

6013
03:37:23,810 --> 03:37:25,090
It's like she knows!

6014
03:37:26,230 --> 03:37:26,970
Oh, big.

6015
03:37:26,970 --> 03:37:27,490
Good shit.

6016
03:37:28,070 --> 03:37:29,230
How does she know?

6017
03:37:30,950 --> 03:37:31,670
Oh, no.

6018
03:37:31,830 --> 03:37:32,370
I fucked...

6019
03:37:32,890 --> 03:37:33,330
No.

6020
03:37:33,650 --> 03:37:34,470
That's okay, Doki.

6021
03:37:34,610 --> 03:37:38,230
Now, instead of the Talog, you just run and knee her if you get distance.

6022
03:37:38,650 --> 03:37:39,530
Run and knee her.

6023
03:37:39,590 --> 03:37:39,790
Okay.

6024
03:37:40,290 --> 03:37:41,110
That's the X.

6025
03:37:41,350 --> 03:37:42,130
That's the three, right?

6026
03:37:42,990 --> 03:37:43,430
Yeah.

6027
03:37:44,030 --> 03:37:44,470
Okay.

6028
03:37:45,870 --> 03:37:46,310
Okay.

6029
03:37:49,450 --> 03:37:50,490
There you go.

6030
03:37:50,650 --> 03:37:51,410
Oh my...

6031
03:37:51,970 --> 03:37:52,470
Oh my...

6032
03:37:52,470 --> 03:37:53,350
Oh my god.

6033
03:37:53,410 --> 03:37:53,990
Good shit.

6034
03:37:54,130 --> 03:37:54,490
Okay.

6035
03:37:54,510 --> 03:37:55,030
That was crazy.

6036
03:37:55,330 --> 03:37:56,030
Good start.

6037
03:37:58,650 --> 03:37:59,010
Yay!

6038
03:38:00,050 --> 03:38:00,410
Yeah!

6039
03:38:01,330 --> 03:38:02,470
Oh, you're cooking it.

6040
03:38:02,910 --> 03:38:04,090
You're cooking this feel split.

6041
03:38:04,590 --> 03:38:04,950
Yeah!

6042
03:38:05,110 --> 03:38:06,010
I fucking knew you were going to...

6043
03:38:06,210 --> 03:38:07,250
I fucking knew it!

6044
03:38:07,250 --> 03:38:07,930
I knew it would come.

6045
03:38:09,090 --> 03:38:10,370
I knew you would do that!

6046
03:38:10,650 --> 03:38:11,810
Okay, but when do I do that?

6047
03:38:11,890 --> 03:38:12,390
Oh my god...

6048
03:38:14,190 --> 03:38:14,550
Let's go!

6049
03:38:14,770 --> 03:38:16,050
That hits you in the alley!

6050
03:38:17,990 --> 03:38:19,170
A flash bait.

6051
03:38:21,290 --> 03:38:21,650
Oh, battle.

6052
03:38:21,650 --> 03:38:22,590
Back to the ground you go!

6053
03:38:22,830 --> 03:38:23,910
Get the crates outta here.

6054
03:38:23,910 --> 03:38:24,150
Stop flying!

6055
03:38:25,010 --> 03:38:26,170
Who are you jumping at?

6056
03:38:27,110 --> 03:38:28,570
You don't have wings!

6057
03:38:29,350 --> 03:38:30,090
Oh no.

6058
03:38:30,170 --> 03:38:31,270
It does have wings.

6059
03:38:32,310 --> 03:38:34,410
The supreme Yoshimitsu.

6060
03:38:37,170 --> 03:38:38,110
That's counter hit.

6061
03:38:38,210 --> 03:38:38,990
That's counter hit.

6062
03:38:39,070 --> 03:38:39,610
You hop kick.

6063
03:38:39,650 --> 03:38:40,190
You hop...

6064
03:38:40,190 --> 03:38:40,990
It's fine.

6065
03:38:41,210 --> 03:38:44,030
That is so many clicks.

6066
03:38:44,890 --> 03:38:45,930
That is so many clicks.

6067
03:38:45,930 --> 03:38:46,850
That is so many clicks.

6068
03:38:47,370 --> 03:38:49,490
Oh my god.

6069
03:38:49,870 --> 03:38:51,730
That doggy break special.

6070
03:38:51,950 --> 03:38:56,770
You might have had 20 hundred coaches Gumi, but I just need one.

6071
03:38:57,050 --> 03:38:57,650
Oh my god.

6072
03:38:59,390 --> 03:39:01,630
That's a lot of kicks bro.

6073
03:39:02,910 --> 03:39:05,950
Damn, is that that iMusician coaching?

6074
03:39:06,390 --> 03:39:06,610
No.

6075
03:39:08,890 --> 03:39:11,010
Damn, that's a little toxic.

6076
03:39:13,330 --> 03:39:15,610
You guys called me broke yesterday.

6077
03:39:18,590 --> 03:39:19,650
Yeah, we hear the coach.

6078
03:39:19,870 --> 03:39:20,210
Nice.

6079
03:39:25,470 --> 03:39:26,490
Only two.

6080
03:39:26,590 --> 03:39:27,190
Yes, yes.

6081
03:39:27,490 --> 03:39:28,410
Oh shit.

6082
03:39:30,350 --> 03:39:32,430
Oh shit, what is she doing to me?

6083
03:39:32,770 --> 03:39:33,970
Oh, she blocked this.

6084
03:39:34,270 --> 03:39:34,790
Damn.

6085
03:39:35,010 --> 03:39:36,790
She blocked it.

6086
03:39:38,770 --> 03:39:41,270
If she ever jumps, she's going low.

6087
03:39:46,690 --> 03:39:48,250
Oh my god.

6088
03:39:48,330 --> 03:39:49,050
How did I miss that?

6089
03:39:49,950 --> 03:39:51,290
It was just a little late.

6090
03:39:51,670 --> 03:39:52,510
I see.

6091
03:39:54,610 --> 03:39:54,830
Oh fuck.

6092
03:39:56,570 --> 03:39:57,530
That's my bad.

6093
03:39:59,030 --> 03:40:00,870
I didn't know he had an instant hurry.

6094
03:40:03,590 --> 03:40:04,130
Nice.

6095
03:40:05,410 --> 03:40:05,950
Okay.

6096
03:40:07,510 --> 03:40:08,710
Oh, fight.

6097
03:40:10,360 --> 03:40:10,970
That's counter hit.

6098
03:40:11,990 --> 03:40:12,530
Yeah.

6099
03:40:14,290 --> 03:40:15,510
No fucking way.

6100
03:40:15,870 --> 03:40:16,410
Good shit.

6101
03:40:16,870 --> 03:40:21,290
What a break.

6102
03:40:22,150 --> 03:40:22,910
Sick break.

6103
03:40:23,350 --> 03:40:23,890
Okay.

6104
03:40:25,190 --> 03:40:25,550
Yeah.

6105
03:40:26,950 --> 03:40:27,310
Nice.

6106
03:40:27,350 --> 03:40:28,450
Oh shit, I fucked up.

6107
03:40:28,610 --> 03:40:29,470
I fucked that up.

6108
03:40:30,690 --> 03:40:32,030
Wait, what did she do to me?

6109
03:40:33,850 --> 03:40:34,790
What is that?

6110
03:40:35,390 --> 03:40:37,670
What the fuck?

6111
03:40:37,690 --> 03:40:38,430
How did I miss that?

6112
03:40:39,070 --> 03:40:40,110
How did I miss that?

6113
03:40:40,170 --> 03:40:40,810
Does it matter though?

6114
03:40:41,290 --> 03:40:42,010
Does it though?

6115
03:40:42,230 --> 03:40:42,590
Yeah.

6116
03:40:44,630 --> 03:40:45,290
One more.

6117
03:40:45,530 --> 03:40:45,730
Yes.

6118
03:40:45,730 --> 03:40:47,570
You're so fucking good.

6119
03:40:47,730 --> 03:40:48,510
One more.

6120
03:40:48,510 --> 03:40:49,650
Oh shit.

6121
03:40:49,810 --> 03:40:50,670
She did that thing.

6122
03:40:52,090 --> 03:40:52,950
Hold back.

6123
03:40:53,090 --> 03:40:54,310
Wait, I hold back though.

6124
03:40:54,650 --> 03:40:58,170
But I hold back.

6125
03:40:58,770 --> 03:40:59,990
How did she do that?

6126
03:41:01,250 --> 03:41:02,830
How did she do that?

6127
03:41:02,910 --> 03:41:03,250
Nice.

6128
03:41:03,810 --> 03:41:05,390
How did she do that?

6129
03:41:06,430 --> 03:41:07,970
Oh my goodness.

6130
03:41:08,270 --> 03:41:08,670
Oh.

6131
03:41:10,750 --> 03:41:12,090
Did I back up?

6132
03:41:12,090 --> 03:41:12,610
No.

6133
03:41:12,770 --> 03:41:14,270
I held back.

6134
03:41:15,970 --> 03:41:17,130
Oh good song.

6135
03:41:17,290 --> 03:41:18,170
Slow ass move.

6136
03:41:19,850 --> 03:41:21,290
My legs were up.

6137
03:41:21,350 --> 03:41:22,150
It wasn't fair.

6138
03:41:26,210 --> 03:41:27,450
Oh shit.

6139
03:41:28,690 --> 03:41:29,930
Oh shit.

6140
03:41:29,930 --> 03:41:30,190
Rage art.

6141
03:41:30,270 --> 03:41:30,490
Rage art.

6142
03:41:30,550 --> 03:41:31,550
I quit.

6143
03:41:32,110 --> 03:41:33,310
She did that thing.

6144
03:41:34,930 --> 03:41:36,410
No I quit.

6145
03:41:37,030 --> 03:41:38,710
It's okay.

6146
03:41:38,710 --> 03:41:39,170
It's okay.

6147
03:41:39,370 --> 03:41:40,310
We got it.

6148
03:41:40,370 --> 03:41:40,730
We got it.

6149
03:41:40,730 --> 03:41:41,330
Run your shit.

6150
03:41:41,390 --> 03:41:41,610
Easy.

6151
03:41:42,690 --> 03:41:43,130
Boom.

6152
03:41:47,190 --> 03:41:48,410
Oh the mix.

6153
03:41:49,470 --> 03:41:49,910
No.

6154
03:41:50,290 --> 03:41:51,610
She does that thingy.

6155
03:41:51,630 --> 03:41:52,990
And it scares me sometimes.

6156
03:41:58,690 --> 03:42:00,070
Oh what the fuck?

6157
03:42:03,150 --> 03:42:03,970
Did I get that?

6158
03:42:04,130 --> 03:42:04,610
That's clean.

6159
03:42:04,790 --> 03:42:06,130
That's a hit.

6160
03:42:08,710 --> 03:42:09,990
It hurts though when she wakes up.

6161
03:42:10,170 --> 03:42:11,250
I don't know though.

6162
03:42:11,510 --> 03:42:12,430
Does she get in time though?

6163
03:42:13,170 --> 03:42:14,030
It's up to you.

6164
03:42:14,410 --> 03:42:15,370
Commit or don't commit.

6165
03:42:15,470 --> 03:42:16,030
Okay we're committing.

6166
03:42:16,670 --> 03:42:17,470
Oh shit.

6167
03:42:21,470 --> 03:42:22,350
She ducked it.

6168
03:42:22,470 --> 03:42:22,930
She ducked it.

6169
03:42:22,950 --> 03:42:24,250
So we had the running knee.

6170
03:42:26,470 --> 03:42:27,170
The three.

6171
03:42:27,270 --> 03:42:27,710
The X.

6172
03:42:27,810 --> 03:42:28,210
Yeah.

6173
03:42:30,270 --> 03:42:31,110
Ain't no big deal.

6174
03:42:31,270 --> 03:42:31,890
Oh my god.

6175
03:42:31,910 --> 03:42:33,410
She actually ducked it.

6176
03:42:34,330 --> 03:42:35,330
Who would have thought?

6177
03:42:37,230 --> 03:42:38,230
Well we adapt.

6178
03:42:39,070 --> 03:42:39,670
Oh.

6179
03:42:40,470 --> 03:42:41,310
How do we adapt?

6180
03:42:43,750 --> 03:42:44,590
Wait what?

6181
03:42:44,830 --> 03:42:45,610
Oh she do.

6182
03:42:45,890 --> 03:42:46,270
Nice duck.

6183
03:42:48,050 --> 03:42:49,550
Nice leg drop.

6184
03:42:49,710 --> 03:42:50,430
Shoulder shark?

6185
03:42:50,970 --> 03:42:52,170
Yes sir.

6186
03:42:52,530 --> 03:42:53,090
Don't duck.

6187
03:42:53,650 --> 03:42:54,250
Yes.

6188
03:42:55,570 --> 03:42:56,170
Okay.

6189
03:42:57,550 --> 03:42:58,970
Oh she did that though.

6190
03:43:00,450 --> 03:43:01,310
I'm scared of that.

6191
03:43:05,840 --> 03:43:06,440
Yay.

6192
03:43:07,400 --> 03:43:07,960
Nice.

6193
03:43:15,660 --> 03:43:16,540
Oh my god.

6194
03:43:16,580 --> 03:43:18,720
When she does that it's actually so hard to counter.

6195
03:43:19,500 --> 03:43:20,020
Sure.

6196
03:43:22,820 --> 03:43:23,620
Don't duck.

6197
03:43:24,440 --> 03:43:24,960
Yay.

6198
03:43:26,160 --> 03:43:26,680
Oh.

6199
03:43:30,420 --> 03:43:31,420
Nice hop kick.

6200
03:43:31,420 --> 03:43:31,820
Nice.

6201
03:43:33,780 --> 03:43:34,300
Okay.

6202
03:43:34,940 --> 03:43:35,460
Okay.

6203
03:43:35,620 --> 03:43:35,860
Beautiful.

6204
03:43:36,300 --> 03:43:37,040
Oh I blocked.

6205
03:43:37,120 --> 03:43:37,820
I think I blocked it.

6206
03:43:38,360 --> 03:43:39,100
Wait what?

6207
03:43:40,160 --> 03:43:42,260
No you were mashing back three.

6208
03:43:42,680 --> 03:43:43,360
Oh yeah.

6209
03:43:43,580 --> 03:43:44,720
Oh it registered it.

6210
03:43:45,160 --> 03:43:45,680
Yeah.

6211
03:43:45,880 --> 03:43:46,960
Yeah my buff rate.

6212
03:43:47,160 --> 03:43:48,440
Oh it buffered it.

6213
03:43:48,520 --> 03:43:48,880
No.

6214
03:43:50,220 --> 03:43:51,740
I mean you have rage art too.

6215
03:43:52,000 --> 03:43:52,460
What?

6216
03:43:52,720 --> 03:43:54,460
Oh I have to stand up after that.

6217
03:43:54,480 --> 03:43:54,840
Okay.

6218
03:43:54,840 --> 03:43:55,120
Okay.

6219
03:43:55,240 --> 03:43:56,700
Down down down back.

6220
03:43:56,960 --> 03:43:57,220
Yeah.

6221
03:43:59,200 --> 03:43:59,720
Okay.

6222
03:44:00,060 --> 03:44:00,580
Alright.

6223
03:44:04,860 --> 03:44:05,380
Nice.

6224
03:44:07,840 --> 03:44:08,360
Okay.

6225
03:44:10,500 --> 03:44:11,020
Okay.

6226
03:44:11,400 --> 03:44:11,460
Okay.

6227
03:44:14,180 --> 03:44:14,660
Oh.

6228
03:44:14,660 --> 03:44:16,300
Every time she does that.

6229
03:44:16,620 --> 03:44:18,300
Yeah you have to mash four.

6230
03:44:18,480 --> 03:44:19,260
If you block it you...

6231
03:44:19,260 --> 03:44:20,200
The right kick.

6232
03:44:20,320 --> 03:44:21,920
The circle to punish that.

6233
03:44:22,280 --> 03:44:24,560
If you block low mash circle you will...

6234
03:44:24,560 --> 03:44:25,380
Yeah.

6235
03:44:28,680 --> 03:44:29,480
Nice hop kick.

6236
03:44:29,500 --> 03:44:29,780
Nice.

6237
03:44:29,820 --> 03:44:31,660
Oh I keep my hands is like...

6238
03:44:32,260 --> 03:44:33,040
It's a... yeah.

6239
03:44:35,140 --> 03:44:37,320
Sometimes my hands are in the wrong position.

6240
03:44:37,720 --> 03:44:38,140
Got that one.

6241
03:44:38,640 --> 03:44:39,120
Yeah.

6242
03:44:39,120 --> 03:44:39,460
Yeah.

6243
03:44:39,820 --> 03:44:40,380
Yeah.

6244
03:44:40,500 --> 03:44:41,060
Okay.

6245
03:44:41,420 --> 03:44:41,980
Yes.

6246
03:44:42,080 --> 03:44:42,360
Yes.

6247
03:44:42,500 --> 03:44:43,060
Final.

6248
03:44:43,260 --> 03:44:43,820
Final.

6249
03:44:43,820 --> 03:44:44,360
Final.

6250
03:44:44,360 --> 03:44:44,840
Final.

6251
03:44:44,920 --> 03:44:45,380
You got it.

6252
03:44:45,420 --> 03:44:45,800
Let's go Doki.

6253
03:44:49,780 --> 03:44:50,340
Okay.

6254
03:44:50,560 --> 03:44:50,700
Oh.

6255
03:44:51,660 --> 03:44:53,040
I hate that attack.

6256
03:44:55,040 --> 03:44:57,540
Oh no I think she got me from this.

6257
03:44:57,540 --> 03:44:57,780
No.

6258
03:44:58,780 --> 03:44:59,340
No.

6259
03:44:59,960 --> 03:45:01,220
That was close.

6260
03:45:01,800 --> 03:45:02,460
Very close.

6261
03:45:02,560 --> 03:45:03,100
Very close.

6262
03:45:04,020 --> 03:45:04,940
Nice try.

6263
03:45:04,940 --> 03:45:05,560
Nice try.

6264
03:45:06,980 --> 03:45:08,740
It's just that spinning low thing.

6265
03:45:08,760 --> 03:45:10,400
That spinning one always throws me off.

6266
03:45:10,520 --> 03:45:10,740
Yeah.

6267
03:45:10,860 --> 03:45:11,140
Yeah.

6268
03:45:11,520 --> 03:45:12,840
And we will work on that.

6269
03:45:12,960 --> 03:45:13,920
It's very easy.

6270
03:45:14,160 --> 03:45:16,400
So for the tourney if we have to fight her.

6271
03:45:17,280 --> 03:45:18,200
We should be okay.

6272
03:45:18,520 --> 03:45:20,420
It's okay we got the intel now.

6273
03:45:20,960 --> 03:45:21,080
Oh.

6274
03:45:27,240 --> 03:45:28,840
Wait do I have to press four?

6275
03:45:29,040 --> 03:45:29,980
After I block it?

6276
03:45:30,860 --> 03:45:32,360
Yeah so while she is spinning.

6277
03:45:32,400 --> 03:45:35,580
If you just mash four that extra kick that comes out.

6278
03:45:35,600 --> 03:45:36,880
Won't come out and you actually hit her.

6279
03:45:37,080 --> 03:45:37,260
Oh.

6280
03:45:38,060 --> 03:45:38,900
And there is nothing.

6281
03:45:39,000 --> 03:45:39,860
That she can do to it.

6282
03:45:39,900 --> 03:45:42,300
That is like you get free damage from blocking.

6283
03:45:42,540 --> 03:45:43,300
Oh I see.

6284
03:45:44,460 --> 03:45:46,380
Oh you and Jae-Chan.

6285
03:45:46,840 --> 03:45:47,360
Yeah.

6286
03:45:48,020 --> 03:45:48,920
We are back.

6287
03:45:51,480 --> 03:45:52,580
Blame Ruler damn.

6288
03:45:54,600 --> 03:45:55,880
Gotta hit X bro.

6289
03:45:56,260 --> 03:45:56,780
I

6290
03:46:01,980 --> 03:46:04,000
got this.

6291
03:46:04,340 --> 03:46:05,320
Bring it back.

6292
03:46:08,400 --> 03:46:09,960
I just need to add more moves.

6293
03:46:12,780 --> 03:46:14,180
Bro let's play the game.

6294
03:46:14,200 --> 03:46:15,220
What the heck?

6295
03:46:16,520 --> 03:46:17,600
What is bro doing?

6296
03:46:17,980 --> 03:46:18,920
Rage art button.

6297
03:46:19,040 --> 03:46:19,980
Rage art button slime.

6298
03:46:20,260 --> 03:46:20,740
Slime.

6299
03:46:21,100 --> 03:46:22,080
Is he even here?

6300
03:46:22,120 --> 03:46:23,300
Oh shit.

6301
03:46:32,910 --> 03:46:34,030
King ego match.

6302
03:46:36,090 --> 03:46:36,890
Oh my god.

6303
03:46:36,930 --> 03:46:37,470
The king mirror.

6304
03:46:38,450 --> 03:46:39,210
This is it.

6305
03:46:39,330 --> 03:46:40,030
The king mirror.

6306
03:46:57,780 --> 03:46:58,980
Alright let's cook.

6307
03:46:58,980 --> 03:46:59,700
Round one.

6308
03:47:00,580 --> 03:47:01,220
Fight.

6309
03:47:03,040 --> 03:47:03,680
Nice.

6310
03:47:04,280 --> 03:47:05,540
Got me ducking you.

6311
03:47:07,920 --> 03:47:08,560
Oh.

6312
03:47:08,900 --> 03:47:09,540
Oh.

6313
03:47:13,480 --> 03:47:14,620
Oh my god.

6314
03:47:14,700 --> 03:47:16,400
This fighting game player.

6315
03:47:16,480 --> 03:47:17,380
Jae-Chan.

6316
03:47:17,860 --> 03:47:21,140
This guy fucking playing his fighting game.

6317
03:47:21,980 --> 03:47:23,040
Nice duck.

6318
03:47:23,940 --> 03:47:24,860
Nice yeah.

Yeah.

6320
03:47:37,340 --> 03:47:38,200
What a duck.

6321
03:47:38,320 --> 03:47:38,740
Yes.

6322
03:47:39,900 --> 03:47:40,620
Yes bitch.

6323
03:47:40,800 --> 03:47:41,020
Yeah.

6324
03:47:43,660 --> 03:47:44,360

Yes.

6328
03:47:49,280 --> 03:47:52,740
That's a one or two break.

6329
03:47:52,860 --> 03:47:53,740
Went after the knockdown.

6330
03:47:53,860 --> 03:47:54,500
Kony you have to guess.

6331
03:47:57,000 --> 03:47:57,440
Nice.

6332
03:47:58,000 --> 03:47:58,440
Nice.

6333
03:47:58,440 --> 03:47:58,680
Nice.

6334
03:47:59,740 --> 03:48:00,680
He engaged.

6335
03:48:02,660 --> 03:48:03,200
Wow.

6336
03:48:03,520 --> 03:48:04,600
Gamer over here.

6337
03:48:06,640 --> 03:48:07,960
Rush in after.

6338
03:48:15,270 --> 03:48:15,810
Nice.

6339
03:48:15,990 --> 03:48:16,870
Yeah he knows us.

6340
03:48:17,970 --> 03:48:18,510
Okay.

6341
03:48:23,670 --> 03:48:24,210
Fight.

6342
03:48:25,170 --> 03:48:26,870
Oh that was a good dive.

6343
03:48:27,310 --> 03:48:28,190
Oh my god.

6344
03:48:28,370 --> 03:48:29,610
Trying to duck him but.

6345
03:48:33,130 --> 03:48:34,210
Nice break.

6346
03:48:35,530 --> 03:48:36,910
If you block back one two.

6347
03:48:37,130 --> 03:48:37,850
Back one two and back.

6348
03:48:39,470 --> 03:48:40,870
He did it to you earlier.

6349
03:48:40,970 --> 03:48:41,350
It's a punish.

6350
03:48:45,730 --> 03:48:46,410
Back one.

6351
03:48:46,550 --> 03:48:46,990
Nice.

6352
03:48:48,870 --> 03:48:49,750
Nice job.

6353
03:48:49,930 --> 03:48:50,310
Let's go.

6354
03:48:50,970 --> 03:48:51,250
Yeah.

6355
03:48:51,290 --> 03:48:53,250
Go Kony go.

6356
03:48:55,290 --> 03:48:55,730
Fight.

6357
03:49:01,730 --> 03:49:02,710
Fuck I ducked it.

6358
03:49:02,810 --> 03:49:03,630
But I stood up into it.

6359
03:49:03,830 --> 03:49:05,130
Yeah it was a counter hit.

6360
03:49:21,500 --> 03:49:22,960
Oh my god that didn't grab.

6361
03:49:23,740 --> 03:49:24,500
Yeah it's it.

6362
03:49:24,680 --> 03:49:27,940
He's in full crouch during that.

6363
03:49:28,000 --> 03:49:28,240
Uh huh.

6364
03:49:29,360 --> 03:49:30,220
Ain't no thing.

6365
03:49:30,620 --> 03:49:32,560
And Kony you had your heal.

6366
03:49:32,560 --> 03:49:34,000
You died with your heal.

6367
03:49:34,200 --> 03:49:37,200
He also didn't use his SSL.

6368
03:49:37,300 --> 03:49:37,740
Right yeah.

6369
03:49:49,400 --> 03:49:49,960
Fuck.

6370
03:49:55,910 --> 03:49:57,490
Dude again I'm ducking it.

6371
03:49:57,590 --> 03:49:58,470
But it's like delayed.

6372
03:49:59,690 --> 03:50:00,250
Yeah.

6373
03:50:10,060 --> 03:50:10,620
Fuck.

6374
03:50:10,620 --> 03:50:11,520
Not even grab.

6375
03:50:12,720 --> 03:50:13,060
Just no.

6376
03:50:14,460 --> 03:50:15,300
Round two.

6377
03:50:16,220 --> 03:50:16,780
Fight.

6378
03:50:23,680 --> 03:50:24,240
Nice.

6379
03:50:26,380 --> 03:50:27,500
Nice kick.

6380
03:50:35,000 --> 03:50:35,860
Good duck.

6381
03:50:42,520 --> 03:50:43,620
You're in hate Kony.

6382
03:50:43,920 --> 03:50:44,660
Yeah I know.

6383
03:50:46,400 --> 03:50:46,960
Bigly.

6384
03:50:47,380 --> 03:50:50,360
Maybe let's not back one two as much in neutral.

6385
03:50:50,520 --> 03:50:51,600
But I mean do what you're comfortable.

6386
03:50:52,180 --> 03:50:52,740
No you're right.

6387
03:50:54,000 --> 03:50:54,600
Nice.

6388
03:50:54,980 --> 03:50:56,460
Does he not duck that?

6389
03:50:56,760 --> 03:50:57,200
Nope.

6390
03:50:58,060 --> 03:50:58,840
He's a no.

6391
03:51:00,140 --> 03:51:00,740
Yes.

6392
03:51:00,780 --> 03:51:01,120
Oh.

6393
03:51:04,500 --> 03:51:04,800
Nice.

6394
03:51:07,320 --> 03:51:09,040
I'm gonna learn more knee later.

6395
03:51:09,560 --> 03:51:10,160
Fight.

6396
03:51:12,080 --> 03:51:12,680
Oh.

6397
03:51:13,960 --> 03:51:15,240
Oh my god.

6398
03:51:15,640 --> 03:51:16,240
James.

6399
03:51:17,540 --> 03:51:18,140
Fuck.

6400
03:51:18,140 --> 03:51:18,560
Yeah.

6401
03:51:21,340 --> 03:51:22,740
What a fucking run.

6402
03:51:22,740 --> 03:51:23,200
I'm gonna break Kony.

6403
03:51:24,540 --> 03:51:25,100
Fuck.

6404
03:51:29,800 --> 03:51:30,640
Let's go King.

6405
03:51:31,240 --> 03:51:31,800
Nice.

6406
03:51:31,800 --> 03:51:32,260
Nice.

6407
03:51:32,560 --> 03:51:33,120
Oh.

6408
03:51:35,340 --> 03:51:36,600
Oh my god.

6409
03:51:36,720 --> 03:51:37,460
Cook this man.

6410
03:51:37,960 --> 03:51:38,820
You got this.

6411
03:51:53,930 --> 03:51:54,690
What a hot kick.

6412
03:51:54,690 --> 03:51:54,990
Yes.

6413
03:51:55,030 --> 03:51:55,930
Oh my god nice.

6414
03:52:02,700 --> 03:52:04,120
I'm supposed to be a fucking.

6415
03:52:05,400 --> 03:52:07,080
I'm supposed to be a fucking grab.

6416
03:52:09,360 --> 03:52:10,480
I'm supposed to be a fucking grab.

6417
03:52:11,340 --> 03:52:11,860
Yo.

6418
03:52:11,900 --> 03:52:12,420
Yes.

6419
03:52:12,460 --> 03:52:14,620
You're a fucking legend for blocking that low.

6420
03:52:14,780 --> 03:52:15,240
Nice.

6421
03:52:16,360 --> 03:52:17,680
You broke his streak.

6422
03:52:19,760 --> 03:52:22,260
I cannot believe you right now.

6423
03:52:22,420 --> 03:52:24,400
Oh my god you broke his streak.

6424
03:52:25,000 --> 03:52:26,280
That was so beautifully clutch.

6425
03:52:27,920 --> 03:52:28,540
Let's go.

6426
03:52:28,540 --> 03:52:29,340
I can't believe you bro.

6427
03:52:29,840 --> 03:52:31,980
I can feel the layers from here man.

6428
03:52:32,480 --> 03:52:33,540
Round one.

6429
03:52:33,840 --> 03:52:34,360
Holy.

6430
03:52:34,860 --> 03:52:35,720
This is sweat.

6431
03:52:43,240 --> 03:52:44,120
This is battles.

6432
03:52:44,780 --> 03:52:45,340
This is battles.

6433
03:52:45,340 --> 03:52:46,240
It's like rock paper scissors.

6434
03:52:46,760 --> 03:52:47,020
It's like rock paper scissors.

6435
03:52:50,420 --> 03:52:50,900
Fuck.

6436
03:52:51,100 --> 03:52:51,440
Okay.

6437
03:52:52,220 --> 03:52:53,900
I didn't know that like bounced on wall.

6438
03:52:54,360 --> 03:52:55,140
No problem.

6439
03:52:55,240 --> 03:52:55,520
No problem.

6440
03:52:56,140 --> 03:52:56,720
There's one.

6441
03:52:58,980 --> 03:52:59,460
Nice.

6442
03:53:00,640 --> 03:53:00,900
Nice.

6443
03:53:15,280 --> 03:53:15,760
Nice.

6444
03:53:17,840 --> 03:53:18,500
Oh nice.

6445
03:53:18,640 --> 03:53:18,800
Oh nice.

6446
03:53:18,820 --> 03:53:19,720
Oh.

6447
03:53:22,920 --> 03:53:24,400
Oh what a break.

6448
03:53:24,620 --> 03:53:25,160
Break nice.

6449
03:53:26,180 --> 03:53:27,320
You know what else?

6450
03:53:28,080 --> 03:53:28,760
What?

6451
03:53:29,900 --> 03:53:30,580
Oh.

6452
03:53:30,820 --> 03:53:32,100
That's what it is.

6453
03:53:32,100 --> 03:53:33,340
You're so clutch.

6454
03:53:33,500 --> 03:53:34,360
You're just better.

6455
03:53:35,320 --> 03:53:37,480
I can't watch this man.

6456
03:53:38,660 --> 03:53:39,960
This is too intense.

6457
03:53:40,360 --> 03:53:41,020
Yeah.

6458
03:53:42,000 --> 03:53:43,580
Oh good kick.

6459
03:53:47,100 --> 03:53:47,780
Huge.

6460
03:53:47,860 --> 03:53:48,280
Huge.

6461
03:53:49,080 --> 03:53:50,340
I can't get him.

6462
03:53:52,840 --> 03:53:53,540
Hmm.

6463
03:53:53,880 --> 03:53:54,360
Oh.

6464
03:53:55,140 --> 03:53:55,840
Oh.

6465
03:53:56,380 --> 03:53:57,800
He don't know.

6466
03:53:59,780 --> 03:54:00,480
Yeah.

6467
03:54:00,480 --> 03:54:01,440
Let's fucking go.

6468
03:54:01,680 --> 03:54:02,140
Let's go.

6469
03:54:02,360 --> 03:54:03,920
Yes bitch.

6470
03:54:05,000 --> 03:54:05,700
Fight.

6471
03:54:07,020 --> 03:54:07,720
Oh.

6472
03:54:11,100 --> 03:54:12,140
The missile.

6473
03:54:12,400 --> 03:54:13,280
Oh the missile.

6474
03:54:13,900 --> 03:54:15,500
Oh my god what a whiff.

6475
03:54:16,860 --> 03:54:18,360
Oh do it again.

6476
03:54:21,060 --> 03:54:21,280
Oh my god.

6477
03:54:21,280 --> 03:54:22,020
I love this man.

6478
03:54:23,880 --> 03:54:25,920
You said you're gonna buy bro pro a drink.

6479
03:54:25,960 --> 03:54:27,260
I'm gonna buy you a drink.

6480
03:54:27,500 --> 03:54:29,860
You broke his fucking win streak yo.

6481
03:54:30,480 --> 03:54:31,060
Let's go.

6482
03:54:31,380 --> 03:54:33,680
You killed his win streak and took the game.

6483
03:54:33,940 --> 03:54:34,940
Break his mind.

6484
03:54:34,960 --> 03:54:36,100
You mind broke this man.

6485
03:54:37,140 --> 03:54:38,540
That's the evil commentator.

6486
03:54:38,600 --> 03:54:39,440
He's seen it all.

6487
03:54:41,740 --> 03:54:42,860
You're actually him.

6488
03:54:43,060 --> 03:54:44,200
Just mixes bro.

6489
03:54:44,320 --> 03:54:44,980
Just mixes.

6490
03:54:46,280 --> 03:54:46,760
Woo.

6491
03:54:46,760 --> 03:54:47,020
Sick.

6492
03:54:48,580 --> 03:54:49,060
Alright.

6493
03:54:49,280 --> 03:54:49,920
I'm happy.

6494
03:54:50,280 --> 03:54:51,840
That was rough though man.

6495
03:54:51,980 --> 03:54:53,480
He's learned some tricks.

6496
03:54:54,960 --> 03:54:56,660
The disparity from two days ago.

6497
03:54:56,900 --> 03:54:58,860
I'm too antsy with the back one too.

6498
03:54:59,100 --> 03:55:00,920
I gotta really fucking stop that.

6499
03:55:01,340 --> 03:55:02,620
Yeah it's pretty bad.

6500
03:55:02,940 --> 03:55:03,120
But yeah.

6501
03:55:04,440 --> 03:55:07,660
He's got really bad get up habits.

6502
03:55:07,980 --> 03:55:10,340
I know when he's gonna stand or duck.

6503
03:55:10,500 --> 03:55:12,300
And it got more obvious over time.

6504
03:55:13,020 --> 03:55:13,500
Sure.

6505
03:55:13,860 --> 03:55:14,460
That was scary.

6506
03:55:14,700 --> 03:55:14,940
Okay.

6507
03:55:15,040 --> 03:55:15,440
Good shit.

6508
03:55:18,240 --> 03:55:19,040
Well played.

6509
03:55:20,780 --> 03:55:21,580
Well played.

6510
03:55:21,580 --> 03:55:23,760
This has to be the most intense match up yet.

6511
03:55:26,080 --> 03:55:26,640
Here we go.

6512
03:55:28,680 --> 03:55:29,420
Let's go slime.

6513
03:55:30,560 --> 03:55:31,140
Let's go slime.

6514
03:55:31,140 --> 03:55:31,260
Got this.

6515
03:55:32,080 --> 03:55:34,940
What did you own him with last time that he probably worked on?

6516
03:55:35,060 --> 03:55:36,500
Wasn't he free to like back one?

6517
03:55:36,940 --> 03:55:38,600
I just ate a lot of back ones.

6518
03:55:38,920 --> 03:55:39,440
Oh you mean him.

6519
03:55:39,460 --> 03:55:39,640
Sorry.

6520
03:55:39,780 --> 03:55:41,000
He ate a lot of electrics.

6521
03:55:42,600 --> 03:55:43,000
Okay.

6522
03:55:43,060 --> 03:55:44,680
We'll try it until it doesn't work.

6523
03:55:44,740 --> 03:55:46,160
Cause we don't know what he's labbed.

6524
03:55:46,760 --> 03:55:48,120
You know how we labbed a lot.

6525
03:55:48,180 --> 03:55:49,680
We don't know how much he's retained either.

6526
03:55:49,800 --> 03:55:50,260
You know what I mean.

6527
03:55:50,860 --> 03:55:53,420
You can kinda play your game and we can go from there.

6528
03:55:53,860 --> 03:55:54,300
Yep.

6529
03:55:59,810 --> 03:56:00,750
Okay this guy.

6530
03:56:02,010 --> 03:56:03,130
What a start.

6531
03:56:03,230 --> 03:56:03,610
Genie club.

6532
03:56:07,190 --> 03:56:08,190
Oh nice day.

6533
03:56:13,090 --> 03:56:13,530
Alright.

6534
03:56:14,570 --> 03:56:15,210
That's alright.

6535
03:56:25,520 --> 03:56:26,680
Oh you had that.

6536
03:56:27,540 --> 03:56:27,980
Oh.

6537
03:56:36,790 --> 03:56:37,670
Good shit.

6538
03:56:37,790 --> 03:56:40,190
One down five more.

6539
03:56:40,290 --> 03:56:40,730
Yeah.

6540
03:56:49,240 --> 03:56:50,540
That's what I'm talking about.

6541
03:56:50,660 --> 03:56:51,540
That's some good shit right there.

6542
03:56:53,540 --> 03:56:54,980
Good blocks dude.

6543
03:56:58,560 --> 03:56:59,400
Down stairs.

6544
03:56:59,620 --> 03:56:59,880
Nice.

6545
03:57:00,180 --> 03:57:01,540
Off wall killer.

6546
03:57:02,960 --> 03:57:04,780
Had the combo ready and everything.

6547
03:57:05,000 --> 03:57:05,580
Nice conversion.

6548
03:57:06,220 --> 03:57:07,320
Beautiful conversion.

6549
03:57:09,500 --> 03:57:10,420
He's learning.

6550
03:57:11,800 --> 03:57:12,640
Round three.

6551
03:57:12,640 --> 03:57:12,720
Round three.

6552
03:57:12,740 --> 03:57:13,640
Wow that was sick.

6553
03:57:13,700 --> 03:57:17,620
Let her get one string.

6554
03:57:19,140 --> 03:57:20,920
You can feel good you know.

6555
03:57:21,540 --> 03:57:22,420
You can feel good you know.

6556
03:57:23,980 --> 03:57:24,540
Okay.

6557
03:57:25,420 --> 03:57:25,500
Okay.

6558
03:57:26,180 --> 03:57:27,460
Dude that's one piston.

6559
03:57:35,510 --> 03:57:36,850
Perfect hopkick too.

6560
03:57:38,150 --> 03:57:38,710
Boom.

6561
03:57:40,530 --> 03:57:41,470
Oh boom.

6562
03:57:42,150 --> 03:57:43,070
He was.

6563
03:57:43,210 --> 03:57:43,390
He was.

6564
03:57:47,000 --> 03:57:47,620
What?

6565
03:57:47,700 --> 03:57:49,140
Oh my god.

6566
03:57:49,400 --> 03:57:49,960
Eat her.

6567
03:57:49,960 --> 03:57:49,980
Eat her.

6568
03:57:49,980 --> 03:57:51,560
Eat her bird.

6569
03:57:56,120 --> 03:57:57,540
Feast mode activated.

6570
03:57:58,180 --> 03:57:59,780
It's hibernation time.

6571
03:58:00,760 --> 03:58:01,920
I'm going to sleep.

6572
03:58:02,860 --> 03:58:04,160
Let's fucking go slime.

6573
03:58:04,280 --> 03:58:04,780
One more dude.

6574
03:58:05,740 --> 03:58:07,220
Three more rounds you got it.

6575
03:58:09,240 --> 03:58:10,440
Round one.

6576
03:58:11,320 --> 03:58:11,940
Fight.

6577
03:58:14,240 --> 03:58:14,860
Yes.

6578
03:58:14,860 --> 03:58:15,240
Yes.

6579
03:58:20,760 --> 03:58:21,980
Okay he's not going to learn.

6580
03:58:29,840 --> 03:58:30,620
Nice break.

6581
03:58:38,310 --> 03:58:38,750
Okay.

6582
03:58:39,170 --> 03:58:39,610
Oh.

6583
03:58:39,790 --> 03:58:40,570
Remember slime?

6584
03:58:40,650 --> 03:58:42,070
Stone hit to get out of the wall.

6585
03:58:42,190 --> 03:58:42,850
Away from the wall.

6586
03:58:43,070 --> 03:58:43,510
Yeah.

6587
03:58:43,630 --> 03:58:50,420
Oh that was nice duck.

6588
03:58:51,680 --> 03:58:52,940
That was so sick.

6589
03:58:52,960 --> 03:58:54,460
The frame trap with the movement.

6590
03:58:55,700 --> 03:58:56,140
Nice.

6591
03:58:58,200 --> 03:58:58,640
Huge.

6592
03:59:00,240 --> 03:59:01,200
Keep her on that wall.

6593
03:59:03,620 --> 03:59:04,740
Oh my god that chip.

6594
03:59:04,780 --> 03:59:04,820
Oh my god.

6595
03:59:04,840 --> 03:59:05,600
Jesus Christ.

6596
03:59:05,700 --> 03:59:06,720
The infinite pressure.

6597
03:59:08,200 --> 03:59:09,660
She did not like that.

6598
03:59:12,200 --> 03:59:13,680
Oh nice flip.

6599
03:59:13,960 --> 03:59:15,920
They didn't fucking know man.

6600
03:59:17,000 --> 03:59:17,800
Round three.

6601
03:59:18,680 --> 03:59:19,320
Fight.

6602
03:59:28,940 --> 03:59:30,460
Good shit not finishing it.

6603
03:59:39,780 --> 03:59:40,760
That was good.

6604
03:59:41,160 --> 03:59:43,340
Good fucking way.

6605
03:59:43,360 --> 03:59:43,860
You knew.

6606
03:59:45,260 --> 03:59:46,560
Whipping shit like that.

6607
03:59:46,840 --> 03:59:47,860
You fucking knew.

6608
03:59:52,580 --> 03:59:53,600
Hold this bro.

6609
03:59:53,640 --> 03:59:54,760
You won three.

6610
03:59:54,880 --> 03:59:57,860
And that and this and that and the fish.

6611
04:00:03,440 --> 04:00:03,740
Nice.

6612
04:00:04,440 --> 04:00:04,460
Nice.

6613
04:00:07,220 --> 04:00:09,260
Oh my god you broke her block.

6614
04:00:15,120 --> 04:00:15,720
Oh my god you broke her block.

6615
04:00:15,720 --> 04:00:15,760
Yeah.

6616
04:00:16,560 --> 04:00:17,160
Yeah.

6617
04:00:17,340 --> 04:00:18,480
Oh my god she's toxic.

6618
04:00:21,620 --> 04:00:22,220
Oh.

6619
04:00:22,280 --> 04:00:22,960
It's okay.

6620
04:00:26,870 --> 04:00:28,110
That's a counter hit.

6621
04:00:29,370 --> 04:00:30,470
That's a counter hit.

6622
04:00:30,470 --> 04:00:31,310
Yeah.

6623
04:00:31,470 --> 04:00:32,430
What the fuck is that?

6624
04:00:33,590 --> 04:00:34,970
Wild Rising 1 or something.

6625
04:00:36,890 --> 04:00:37,330
Yeah.

6626
04:00:37,790 --> 04:00:38,630
It's a frame trap.

6627
04:00:46,660 --> 04:00:47,900
Oh there it was.

6628
04:00:48,120 --> 04:00:48,560
Oh.

6629
04:00:48,780 --> 04:00:49,560
There it is.

6630
04:00:49,900 --> 04:00:52,800
Big damage.

6631
04:00:58,340 --> 04:00:58,780
Nice.

6632
04:00:59,560 --> 04:01:00,560
It's a good power crushing.

6633
04:01:00,560 --> 04:01:00,840
It's alright.

6634
04:01:02,460 --> 04:01:05,860
I think after Wild Running 1 plus 2 Bear Stance.

6635
04:01:06,780 --> 04:01:08,940
He's not gonna duck looking for that grab.

6636
04:01:08,940 --> 04:01:10,700
I think you could have done another one honestly.

6637
04:01:10,960 --> 04:01:11,400
Okay.

6638
04:01:11,700 --> 04:01:13,900
Yeah I think play around the Hunting Bear Stance mix up.

6639
04:01:14,000 --> 04:01:15,940
And when you back one Hunting Bear Stance.

6640
04:01:16,040 --> 04:01:17,420
Even though that's fake as hell.

6641
04:01:17,700 --> 04:01:20,700
He will eat the Bear Stance 1 plus 2 every time.

6642
04:01:21,000 --> 04:01:21,420
Okay.

6643
04:01:21,520 --> 04:01:22,260
Round 1.

6644
04:01:23,360 --> 04:01:23,800
Fight.

6645
04:01:27,680 --> 04:01:28,920
Yeah that was good whiff punish.

6646
04:01:35,160 --> 04:01:35,600
Nice.

6647
04:01:38,100 --> 04:01:39,380
Got all that health back.

6648
04:01:40,640 --> 04:01:41,080
Nice.

6649
04:01:48,400 --> 04:01:49,420
Why does that work?

6650
04:01:52,460 --> 04:01:52,940
Okay.

6651
04:01:53,100 --> 04:01:53,440
Okay.

6652
04:01:53,860 --> 04:01:54,320
Probably mashing.

6653
04:01:54,760 --> 04:01:55,240
Yeah.

6654
04:01:55,680 --> 04:01:56,820
You just have to hold back.

6655
04:01:57,100 --> 04:01:57,860
Round 2.

6656
04:01:58,820 --> 04:01:59,300
Fight.

6657
04:02:00,360 --> 04:02:00,840
Heh.

6658
04:02:01,880 --> 04:02:02,360
Slap.

6659
04:02:02,380 --> 04:02:02,680
Good grab.

6660
04:02:10,590 --> 04:02:12,070
Oh she whiffed.

6661
04:02:14,930 --> 04:02:16,730
Stone head this man at the wall.

6662
04:02:21,010 --> 04:02:22,170
Why didn't that counter hit?

6663
04:02:22,250 --> 04:02:22,450
Whatever.

6664
04:02:23,830 --> 04:02:25,630
Yeah it was too late I guess.

6665
04:02:26,250 --> 04:02:26,650
Nice.

6666
04:02:28,850 --> 04:02:29,650
Round 3.

6667
04:02:30,810 --> 04:02:31,210
Fight.

6668
04:02:32,510 --> 04:02:32,910
Oh.

6669
04:02:37,050 --> 04:02:38,310
Look he doesn't even know it's launch.

6670
04:02:38,370 --> 04:02:38,670
That's great.

6671
04:02:40,610 --> 04:02:41,430
What a cheat card.

6672
04:02:41,510 --> 04:02:42,110
I didn't mean to do that.

6673
04:02:42,190 --> 04:02:43,550
That looks funny as fuck though.

6674
04:02:44,850 --> 04:02:45,450
That's so good.

6675
04:02:45,490 --> 04:02:45,750
That's good.

6676
04:02:48,510 --> 04:02:49,310
Stone head baby.

6677
04:02:50,370 --> 04:02:50,770
Oh.

6678
04:02:50,970 --> 04:02:52,270
You kicked me to the wrong side.

6679
04:02:52,850 --> 04:02:53,470
Good job.

6680
04:02:55,290 --> 04:02:55,730
Yeah.

6681
04:02:55,730 --> 04:02:56,750
The haunted bear stance.

6682
04:03:00,990 --> 04:03:01,670
That's it.

6683
04:03:01,730 --> 04:03:01,950
Nice.

6684
04:03:02,230 --> 04:03:02,950
Oh nice hit.

6685
04:03:03,250 --> 04:03:04,010
Oh good.

6686
04:03:04,150 --> 04:03:04,390
Oh again.

6687
04:03:04,810 --> 04:03:05,850
Let's fucking punish.

6688
04:03:09,370 --> 04:03:10,850
I can't believe you broke that.

6689
04:03:10,930 --> 04:03:11,370
That was incredible.

6690
04:03:12,270 --> 04:03:12,750
Nice.

6691
04:03:12,750 --> 04:03:13,410
That's again.

6692
04:03:17,950 --> 04:03:19,050
He's left there alone.

6693
04:03:19,270 --> 04:03:19,730
I didn't do that.

6694
04:03:20,570 --> 04:03:21,050
Unblockable.

6695
04:03:22,670 --> 04:03:23,530
You have raid.

6696
04:03:24,370 --> 04:03:24,850
Nice.

6697
04:03:24,850 --> 04:03:24,990
Nice.

6698
04:03:25,050 --> 04:03:26,250
It's time he puts pressure on your rage.

6699
04:03:26,310 --> 04:03:26,510
Yeah.

6700
04:03:28,290 --> 04:03:29,790
When he puts pressure on your rage.

6701
04:03:29,990 --> 04:03:31,570
You mean like this right?

6702
04:03:31,710 --> 04:03:32,150
Yes.

6703
04:03:32,150 --> 04:03:33,030
Like this?

6704
04:03:35,890 --> 04:03:36,330
Like that.

6705
04:03:36,730 --> 04:03:37,270
Right there.

6706
04:03:39,970 --> 04:03:41,310
One more guess right?

6707
04:03:41,490 --> 04:03:42,550
You have a heat slime.

6708
04:03:42,710 --> 04:03:43,030
Keep up.

6709
04:03:43,990 --> 04:03:44,630
Got him.

6710
04:03:45,370 --> 04:03:45,810
Let's go.

6711
04:03:47,770 --> 04:03:49,190
Rip that shit.

6712
04:03:49,190 --> 04:03:50,630
Let's fucking go baby.

6713
04:03:51,050 --> 04:03:51,490
Yes.

6714
04:03:52,070 --> 04:03:53,110
That's our bear.

6715
04:03:53,390 --> 04:03:53,990
Fucking go.

6716
04:03:54,350 --> 04:03:56,250
That's our big baby poo bear.

6717
04:03:56,270 --> 04:03:57,950
That's our big baby poo bear.

6718
04:03:59,610 --> 04:04:00,450
I fucking.

6719
04:04:00,510 --> 04:04:01,170
I saw it.

6720
04:04:01,270 --> 04:04:03,010
And I had to fucking call it out.

6721
04:04:03,210 --> 04:04:04,490
Good fucking shit dude.

6722
04:04:05,250 --> 04:04:05,770
Woo.

6723
04:04:05,950 --> 04:04:07,110
We're earning it bro.

6724
04:04:07,390 --> 04:04:08,130
We're earning it.

6725
04:04:08,170 --> 04:04:08,670
Getting it back.

6726
04:04:13,950 --> 04:04:15,550
Man you guys are incredible.

6727
04:04:16,010 --> 04:04:16,630
Well done.

6728
04:04:22,030 --> 04:04:23,070
Oh lord.

6729
04:04:23,370 --> 04:04:24,730
All these matches have been so close.

6730
04:04:24,730 --> 04:04:25,830
And I clutched your K-monster too.

6731
04:04:26,150 --> 04:04:27,590
They're so fucking intense.

6732
04:04:28,430 --> 04:04:29,950
All our matches have been.

6733
04:04:31,190 --> 04:04:32,790
It's all in the mainstream too.

6734
04:04:33,930 --> 04:04:34,770
It's the big deal.

6735
04:04:35,790 --> 04:04:37,750
Dude I did that unblockable by accident.

6736
04:04:38,230 --> 04:04:39,750
It might have looked like almost.

6737
04:04:42,070 --> 04:04:43,190
That's what set up his.

6738
04:04:43,450 --> 04:04:44,130
That's what like.

6739
04:04:44,190 --> 04:04:45,170
Oh man he's gonna just.

6740
04:04:45,230 --> 04:04:45,810
He charged me.

6741
04:04:45,830 --> 04:04:46,230
I'm gonna mash.

6742
04:04:46,310 --> 04:04:47,210
And he got that rage up for free.

6743
04:04:48,170 --> 04:04:49,090
It's all set up.

6744
04:04:49,590 --> 04:04:50,950
This guy's on a four win streak.

6745
04:04:51,510 --> 04:04:52,190
It's okay.

6746
04:04:52,230 --> 04:04:52,590
It's okay.

6747
04:04:52,690 --> 04:04:56,030
You were on an 11 win streak.

6748
04:04:56,150 --> 04:04:56,990
In slams.

6749
04:04:57,770 --> 04:04:58,830
Technically like 18.

6750
04:04:58,830 --> 04:04:59,330
Across years.

6751
04:05:08,180 --> 04:05:09,860
Hit him on the ball Jack.

6752
04:05:10,260 --> 04:05:12,880
Hit him on the ball Jack.

6753
04:05:13,380 --> 04:05:14,180
SHINee!

6754
04:05:15,340 --> 04:05:16,340
Yes sir.

6755
04:05:16,420 --> 04:05:18,400
Uh oh.

6756
04:05:19,160 --> 04:05:19,960
SHINee!

6757
04:05:21,300 --> 04:05:22,100
Nice.

6758
04:05:22,260 --> 04:05:23,440
I like it.

6759
04:05:23,540 --> 04:05:24,020
Oh.

6760
04:05:24,620 --> 04:05:27,280
Round two.

6761
04:05:28,100 --> 04:05:28,900
Fight.

6762
04:05:28,900 --> 04:05:28,900
Day.

6763
04:05:29,540 --> 04:05:29,980
One.

6764
04:05:30,820 --> 04:05:31,260
Day.

6765
04:05:32,320 --> 04:05:33,460
That was a good grab.

6766
04:05:35,560 --> 04:05:36,000
SHINee!

6767
04:05:36,960 --> 04:05:37,400
SHINee!

6768
04:05:43,420 --> 04:05:43,860
SHINee!

6769
04:05:43,860 --> 04:05:44,540
Look it's not fair.

6770
04:05:44,620 --> 04:05:45,380
He has a gun.

6771
04:05:46,580 --> 04:05:47,340
Jack has a gun.

6772
04:05:48,360 --> 04:05:49,360
Jack is a gun.

6773
04:05:49,740 --> 04:05:50,700
Jack has two.

6774
04:05:50,840 --> 04:05:52,140
His whole body is a gun.

6775
04:05:52,140 --> 04:05:52,980
Jack is his own gun.

6776
04:05:55,720 --> 04:05:57,840
These are all gunshots in his combos.

6777
04:05:58,100 --> 04:05:59,960
Why do I keep fucking getting that shit man.

6778
04:06:04,060 --> 04:06:04,460
Oh.

6779
04:06:04,560 --> 04:06:04,720
Oh.

6780
04:06:04,720 --> 04:06:04,840
Oh.

6781
04:06:04,840 --> 04:06:04,840
Okay.

6782
04:06:06,560 --> 04:06:07,340
Oh my.

6783
04:06:07,380 --> 04:06:07,540
Yeah.

6784
04:06:07,540 --> 04:06:08,880
Send him to their tournament home.

6785
04:06:10,280 --> 04:06:10,680
Okay.

6786
04:06:10,780 --> 04:06:12,780
We have to walk that when we make the read on it.

6787
04:06:12,860 --> 04:06:13,360
We have to walk.

6788
04:06:13,740 --> 04:06:14,200
Oh fuck you said.

6789
04:06:14,320 --> 04:06:14,440
Oh man.

6790
04:06:15,120 --> 04:06:16,060
My expulsion.

6791
04:06:16,940 --> 04:06:17,340
Expulsion.

6792
04:06:18,140 --> 04:06:18,820
It's infamous.

6793
04:06:19,620 --> 04:06:20,800
Oh my god.

6794
04:06:27,360 --> 04:06:28,160
Nice read.

6795
04:06:29,880 --> 04:06:30,280
Oh.

6796
04:06:32,880 --> 04:06:34,520
Drop combo into kill.

6797
04:06:34,820 --> 04:06:35,860
Drop combo into kill.

6798
04:06:36,220 --> 04:06:37,040
USA baby.

6799
04:06:37,600 --> 04:06:38,420
Let's get it.

6800
04:06:39,140 --> 04:06:39,740
USA.

6801
04:06:40,180 --> 04:06:41,260
He doesn't know.

6802
04:06:44,520 --> 04:06:46,420
Make that grandpa retire.

6803
04:06:47,200 --> 04:06:48,480
He doesn't know.

6804
04:06:48,720 --> 04:06:49,980
He doesn't know.

6805
04:06:51,820 --> 04:06:52,800
He's in the corner.

6806
04:06:53,020 --> 04:06:54,220
There's walls on each side.

6807
04:06:54,400 --> 04:06:55,080
They're closing in.

6808
04:06:55,880 --> 04:06:56,480
Oh.

6809
04:06:56,480 --> 04:06:56,980
Oh.

6810
04:07:00,280 --> 04:07:01,420
He's been in a coma for seven years.

6811
04:07:03,900 --> 04:07:05,100
He's dead.

6812
04:07:05,360 --> 04:07:06,500
He's dead.

6813
04:07:06,500 --> 04:07:07,860
Holy fucking shit man.

6814
04:07:08,260 --> 04:07:08,700
He's dead.

6815
04:07:09,080 --> 04:07:09,960
Holy fucking shit man.

6816
04:07:12,200 --> 04:07:13,000
One.

6817
04:07:14,000 --> 04:07:16,420
His heart stopped midway.

6818
04:07:17,280 --> 04:07:18,080
What?

6819
04:07:18,080 --> 04:07:18,720
Oh bro's counting.

6820
04:07:19,000 --> 04:07:19,640
One.

6821
04:07:21,960 --> 04:07:22,360
Damn.

6822
04:07:28,150 --> 04:07:29,790
His combos are cool.

6823
04:07:30,030 --> 04:07:30,830
Yeah.

6824
04:07:30,830 --> 04:07:31,990
What a counter hit.

6825
04:07:32,990 --> 04:07:34,130
Oh that was good.

6826
04:07:34,930 --> 04:07:35,530
Oh.

6827
04:07:37,570 --> 04:07:38,290
Let's go.

6828
04:07:38,570 --> 04:07:39,670
Not too time.

6829
04:07:40,350 --> 04:07:40,950
Nice.

6830
04:07:43,110 --> 04:07:44,210
Round two.

6831
04:07:45,150 --> 04:07:45,750
Fight.

6832
04:07:47,970 --> 04:07:48,570
Take.

6833
04:07:49,570 --> 04:07:50,170
Okay.

6834
04:07:50,810 --> 04:07:51,410
Oh my god.

6835
04:07:52,510 --> 04:07:54,350
Blood was looking at his shoes.

6836
04:07:54,690 --> 04:07:55,630
Oh my god.

6837
04:07:55,950 --> 04:07:57,050
He is a gun.

6838
04:07:57,330 --> 04:07:58,870
He is a gun.

6839
04:08:01,370 --> 04:08:03,330
We don't have to wait on Sunday.

6840
04:08:03,490 --> 04:08:04,590
He's back now.

6841
04:08:05,290 --> 04:08:05,950
He's back now.

6842
04:08:07,870 --> 04:08:08,530
Oh.

6843
04:08:09,330 --> 04:08:10,270
Mm-hmm.

6844
04:08:10,290 --> 04:08:11,190
Mm-hmm.

6845
04:08:14,750 --> 04:08:16,090
Wave the white flag.

6846
04:08:16,870 --> 04:08:17,530
No.

6847
04:08:17,730 --> 04:08:18,790
Not there.

6848
04:08:18,910 --> 04:08:19,390
Not there.

6849
04:08:21,050 --> 04:08:21,710
No.

6850
04:08:21,930 --> 04:08:22,990
Not here.

6851
04:08:24,510 --> 04:08:26,550
I can't believe that explosion.

6852
04:08:27,970 --> 04:08:28,630
What?

6853
04:08:29,010 --> 04:08:29,730
Oh fuck.

6854
04:08:32,430 --> 04:08:33,350
Oh fuck.

6855
04:08:33,390 --> 04:08:36,150
That was a good break by the way.

6856
04:08:36,210 --> 04:08:37,010
That was bullshit damage.

6857
04:08:37,350 --> 04:08:37,970
Oh my god.

6858
04:08:37,970 --> 04:08:38,790
Oh good break though.

6859
04:08:41,370 --> 04:08:42,650
Round four.

6860
04:08:43,570 --> 04:08:44,210
Fight.

6861
04:08:44,230 --> 04:08:44,630
Nice.

6862
04:08:47,170 --> 04:08:47,810
Oh.

6863
04:08:55,090 --> 04:08:56,010
Mm-hmm.

6864
04:08:56,150 --> 04:08:56,790
Oh.

6865
04:08:56,850 --> 04:08:58,910
Oh my god.

6866
04:08:59,070 --> 04:09:00,190
Oh my god.

6867
04:09:00,310 --> 04:09:02,650
Oh the ambulance.

6868
04:09:03,510 --> 04:09:04,150
It's over.

6869
04:09:04,470 --> 04:09:05,070
It's over.

6870
04:09:06,810 --> 04:09:07,210
Oh my god.

6871
04:09:07,210 --> 04:09:07,250
That was a good game.

6872
04:09:07,250 --> 04:09:08,090
It's an infinite tech trap.

6873
04:09:08,090 --> 04:09:08,890
Jack just came back.

6874
04:09:09,430 --> 04:09:11,330
That's an infinite tech trap.

6875
04:09:11,510 --> 04:09:11,710
Okay.

6876
04:09:11,770 --> 04:09:15,150
You have to get up correctly otherwise you literally die.

6877
04:09:15,370 --> 04:09:16,150
It's a miracle.

6878
04:09:16,250 --> 04:09:17,210
That's crazy.

6879
04:09:17,250 --> 04:09:17,690
It is.

6880
04:09:17,870 --> 04:09:18,610
It's a miracle.

6881
04:09:19,270 --> 04:09:20,190
Bare time.

6882
04:09:20,450 --> 04:09:21,090
All right Coach.

6883
04:09:21,310 --> 04:09:22,330
Okay Coach.

6884
04:09:22,330 --> 04:09:23,410
Get him coach!

6885
04:09:23,610 --> 04:09:27,070
I mean, that's three wins against them right?

6886
04:09:27,350 --> 04:09:31,150
Yeah, but you gotta get my revenge.

6887
04:09:32,730 --> 04:09:33,810
He's good man.

6888
04:09:35,590 --> 04:09:38,750
I'm just gonna play my best whatever happens, happens.

6889
04:09:38,970 --> 04:09:39,670
Do your best bro.

6890
04:09:39,810 --> 04:09:43,030
I just do your best.

6891
04:09:44,170 --> 04:09:44,810
Let's go.

6892
04:09:49,960 --> 04:09:51,300
I'm gonna close my chat.

6893
04:09:51,540 --> 04:09:52,160
There it is.

6894
04:09:52,460 --> 04:09:52,980
Okay.

6895
04:09:54,620 --> 04:09:56,140
My god, he's a polar bear!

6896
04:09:58,540 --> 04:10:00,000
Global warming is real.

6897
04:10:01,260 --> 04:10:02,620
Yeah, they're on a boat now.

6898
04:10:03,780 --> 04:10:05,060
The shits bad.

6899
04:10:05,280 --> 04:10:07,280
The iceberg's melted and he's in Paris.

6900
04:10:30,480 --> 04:10:32,120
Show him you're the better mammal.

6901
04:10:32,540 --> 04:10:33,200
Good duck.

6902
04:10:45,540 --> 04:10:46,100
Damn.

6903
04:10:47,880 --> 04:10:48,440
Aw.

6904
04:10:54,100 --> 04:10:55,480
Back then, no problem.

6905
04:11:05,390 --> 04:11:06,230
Good shit.

6906
04:11:06,330 --> 04:11:06,810
Nice.

6907
04:11:06,810 --> 04:11:07,090
Oh, nice.

6908
04:11:09,810 --> 04:11:10,290
Oh.

6909
04:11:10,530 --> 04:11:10,710
Oh.

6910
04:11:12,050 --> 04:11:13,770
Oh, my shiny wizard isn't coming out.

6911
04:11:20,280 --> 04:11:20,760
Thanks.

6912
04:11:23,220 --> 04:11:23,700
Okay.

6913
04:11:23,840 --> 04:11:24,620
Is it wall?

6914
04:11:26,700 --> 04:11:27,260
Let's go.

6915
04:11:27,380 --> 04:11:28,280
Right in their dick.

6916
04:11:28,360 --> 04:11:28,700
Yeah!

6917
04:11:30,040 --> 04:11:31,420
Lucky that shit's retracted.

6918
04:11:31,680 --> 04:11:32,920
Make them extinct.

6919
04:11:33,500 --> 04:11:34,140
Oh, no way.

6920
04:11:34,200 --> 04:11:34,740
It whiffed.

6921
04:11:34,740 --> 04:11:35,500
What the hell?

6922
04:11:36,380 --> 04:11:36,940
Just a whiff.

6923
04:11:36,940 --> 04:11:38,560
That way he stands with his legs back, I guess.

6924
04:11:41,080 --> 04:11:43,880
I mean, I would if I got punched in the nuts.

6925
04:11:46,440 --> 04:11:47,200
Holy shit.

6926
04:11:52,220 --> 04:11:52,620
Okay.

6927
04:11:52,740 --> 04:11:53,800
Oh, my god.

6928
04:11:53,980 --> 04:11:55,060
Throw him off the boat.

6929
04:11:55,400 --> 04:11:56,060
Bring him out.

6930
04:12:00,480 --> 04:12:02,420
No, stop that fake shit, bro.

6931
04:12:04,580 --> 04:12:06,020
That fake bullshit, bro.

6932
04:12:12,560 --> 04:12:12,960
Nice.

6933
04:12:13,960 --> 04:12:14,360
Nice.

6934
04:12:14,420 --> 04:12:15,020
Well done.

6935
04:12:15,140 --> 04:12:15,340
Oh, yeah.

6936
04:12:15,340 --> 04:12:15,720
That's guaranteed.

6937
04:12:15,720 --> 04:12:16,560
Yeah!

6938
04:12:17,460 --> 04:12:18,920
That was a guess for game situation.

6939
04:12:20,920 --> 04:12:21,360
Oh.

6940
04:12:22,560 --> 04:12:23,180
It's cool.

6941
04:12:23,300 --> 04:12:23,620
It's fine.

6942
04:12:24,300 --> 04:12:25,140
It's fine, coach.

6943
04:12:25,600 --> 04:12:26,320
A little bit.

6944
04:12:33,320 --> 04:12:34,120
That was fair.

6945
04:12:34,860 --> 04:12:36,440
Yeah, Slime is taking notes right now.

6946
04:12:37,640 --> 04:12:38,080
Nice.

6947
04:12:39,060 --> 04:12:41,640
Might as well prolong this match so he can take more notes.

6948
04:12:42,080 --> 04:12:42,560
What the...

6949
04:12:46,360 --> 04:12:46,800
Oh.

6950
04:12:47,500 --> 04:12:48,180
Broke that.

6951
04:12:50,140 --> 04:12:51,220
He missed his health sweep.

6952
04:12:51,280 --> 04:12:52,500
His dusty ass health sweep.

6953
04:12:52,520 --> 04:12:52,940
We missed it.

6954
04:12:53,820 --> 04:12:54,220
Nice.

6955
04:12:58,330 --> 04:12:59,270
Oh, no way.

6956
04:12:59,430 --> 04:13:00,090
Yes for life.

6957
04:13:00,290 --> 04:13:01,030
Yes for life.

6958
04:13:01,310 --> 04:13:03,350
Yes for your fucking life.

6959
04:13:03,490 --> 04:13:04,330
That's our coach.

6960
04:13:05,930 --> 04:13:06,630
One more.

6961
04:13:07,090 --> 04:13:07,530
One more.

6962
04:13:07,610 --> 04:13:07,870
One more.

6963
04:13:07,990 --> 04:13:08,150
You got this, bro.

6964
04:13:09,010 --> 04:13:10,130
Dusty ass health sweep.

6965
04:13:11,350 --> 04:13:12,110
I love you, bro.

6966
04:13:12,190 --> 04:13:12,590
Broke.

6967
04:13:14,130 --> 04:13:14,630
Let's go.

6968
04:13:15,290 --> 04:13:15,690
Nice.

6969
04:13:15,690 --> 04:13:17,190
Can't believe he didn't duck there.

6970
04:13:17,270 --> 04:13:17,670
You can do it.

6971
04:13:17,730 --> 04:13:18,510
Round one.

6972
04:13:18,590 --> 04:13:19,490
It's the mental games.

6973
04:13:19,850 --> 04:13:21,330
Show him you're the apex predator.

6974
04:13:28,340 --> 04:13:29,220
Oh, no way.

6975
04:13:29,260 --> 04:13:29,940
It crushes mid.

6976
04:13:30,000 --> 04:13:30,100
Oh, no way.

6977
04:13:34,490 --> 04:13:34,990
Nice.

6978
04:13:35,870 --> 04:13:36,370
Nice.

6979
04:13:37,410 --> 04:13:38,410
The alley kick.

6980
04:13:38,570 --> 04:13:39,270
You love it?

6981
04:13:43,010 --> 04:13:43,510
Nice.

6982
04:13:43,870 --> 04:13:44,650
Break that off.

6983
04:13:51,350 --> 04:13:52,430
There it is, boys.

6984
04:13:52,970 --> 04:13:54,030
There's the counter play.

6985
04:13:54,230 --> 04:13:54,890
Nice job.

6986
04:13:55,030 --> 04:13:55,410
Nice.

6987
04:13:55,410 --> 04:13:56,010
Holy fuck.

6988
04:13:57,210 --> 04:13:57,810
Nice job.

6989
04:13:57,810 --> 04:13:58,550
Oh, my god.

6990
04:13:58,550 --> 04:13:58,850
That hit really nice.

6991
04:13:58,850 --> 04:14:00,390
Just a bad situation to be in.

6992
04:14:00,390 --> 04:14:01,110
You beat it.

6993
04:14:01,230 --> 04:14:03,970
I got nothing but a kuma cake on my screen.

6994
04:14:07,010 --> 04:14:07,510
Yummy.

6995
04:14:07,750 --> 04:14:08,230
In four.

6996
04:14:08,250 --> 04:14:08,490
4k.

6997
04:14:08,710 --> 04:14:10,150
Just big bear ass.

6998
04:14:10,150 --> 04:14:10,550
I know, right?

6999
04:14:10,550 --> 04:14:11,290
I lost the graphics.

7000
04:14:11,810 --> 04:14:12,770
For free?

7001
04:14:21,700 --> 04:14:22,360
Oh, no.

7002
04:14:22,400 --> 04:14:22,720
Fuck.

7003
04:14:22,800 --> 04:14:23,280
Nice.

7004
04:14:23,540 --> 04:14:23,940
It's okay.

7005
04:14:24,020 --> 04:14:24,640
We gave them one.

7006
04:14:24,900 --> 04:14:25,060
It's fine.

7007
04:14:25,060 --> 04:14:25,180
Let's go.

7008
04:14:25,880 --> 04:14:26,840
Round three.

7009
04:14:27,880 --> 04:14:28,360
Fight.

7010
04:14:33,400 --> 04:14:35,220
This fucking rock hit your scissors.

7011
04:14:41,140 --> 04:14:42,000
Ooh, backs up.

7012
04:14:42,260 --> 04:14:42,740
Okay.

7013
04:14:43,500 --> 04:14:45,080
We're getting back up about it.

7014
04:14:45,100 --> 04:14:47,120
You're not biting the fucking bait either, are you, Unk?

7015
04:14:47,640 --> 04:14:48,120
Yeah.

7016
04:14:48,280 --> 04:14:48,760
Yeah.

7017
04:14:53,710 --> 04:14:57,530
This is such a slow game of Tekken.

7018
04:15:05,500 --> 04:15:06,640
Oh, nice kick.

7019
04:15:08,400 --> 04:15:08,880
Oh.

7020
04:15:09,180 --> 04:15:10,680
We can settle.

7021
04:15:11,120 --> 04:15:12,720
That's the fuck I'm talking about.

7022
04:15:12,900 --> 04:15:13,640
One more, dude.

7023
04:15:13,680 --> 04:15:13,960
One more.

7024
04:15:14,560 --> 04:15:16,240
Bro, it's a turn-based game.

7025
04:15:16,280 --> 04:15:16,660
It is.

7026
04:15:32,190 --> 04:15:32,910
Nice kick.

7027
04:15:39,980 --> 04:15:40,640
Oh, wow.

7028
04:15:40,680 --> 04:15:41,120
Oh.

7029
04:15:41,340 --> 04:15:42,680
Mix happens.

7030
04:15:42,800 --> 04:15:43,160
Mix happens.

7031
04:15:43,340 --> 04:15:43,800
Okay.

7032
04:15:45,020 --> 04:15:45,500
Fight.

7033
04:15:45,700 --> 04:15:45,940
Oh, nice.

7034
04:15:56,260 --> 04:15:56,740
Huge.

7035
04:15:56,840 --> 04:15:57,420
Oh, nice.

7036
04:15:57,860 --> 04:15:58,760
Oh, my.

7037
04:16:01,700 --> 04:16:02,180
Nice.

7038
04:16:04,640 --> 04:16:05,120
Nice.

7039
04:16:05,540 --> 04:16:05,760
Yeah.

7040
04:16:05,800 --> 04:16:06,040
Let's fucking go.

7041
04:16:06,040 --> 04:16:07,680
I'm just using not to get in between grifstands.

7042
04:16:07,720 --> 04:16:08,440
Let's fucking go.

7043
04:16:09,380 --> 04:16:10,060
One hit.

7044
04:16:11,000 --> 04:16:11,480
Oh.

7045
04:16:12,980 --> 04:16:13,820
Watch your block.

7046
04:16:14,240 --> 04:16:14,720
Yes.

7047
04:16:14,720 --> 04:16:15,460
That's crazy to me.

7048
04:16:15,520 --> 04:16:17,980
Such a smart fucking hit smash.

7049
04:16:19,580 --> 04:16:20,280
Oh, my God.

7050
04:16:20,300 --> 04:16:20,640
The bait.

7051
04:16:22,120 --> 04:16:22,800
That's gone.

7052
04:16:24,020 --> 04:16:24,500
Oh, my God.

7053
04:16:26,940 --> 04:16:28,120
That's a crazy G-Club.

7054
04:16:33,840 --> 04:16:35,200
You were in the air though, right?

7055
04:16:36,380 --> 04:16:36,740
Yeah.

7056
04:16:37,020 --> 04:16:38,740
I mean, it's still going to take all my great life.

7057
04:16:43,940 --> 04:16:44,520
Game over.

7058
04:16:45,200 --> 04:16:45,560
Yes.

7059
04:16:45,560 --> 04:16:45,920
Let's go.

7060
04:16:45,920 --> 04:16:47,360
That's what I'm fucking talking about.

7061
04:16:47,480 --> 04:16:48,540
I didn't even hear a beat.

7062
04:16:48,580 --> 04:16:48,880
Let's fucking go.

7063
04:16:48,960 --> 04:16:50,000
What the fuck are you doing?

7064
04:16:50,300 --> 04:16:51,120
It's so drunk.

7065
04:16:51,380 --> 04:16:52,320
Oh, my God.

7066
04:16:52,460 --> 04:16:53,020
Coach Green.

7067
04:16:53,640 --> 04:16:54,980
Coach, what are you doing?

7068
04:16:55,160 --> 04:16:55,740
Good shit.

7069
04:16:56,020 --> 04:16:58,000
If I do that, you'll be mad at me.

7070
04:16:58,600 --> 04:16:58,960
Hey.

7071
04:16:59,620 --> 04:16:59,960
Hey.

7072
04:16:59,960 --> 04:17:00,220
Hey.

7073
04:17:00,220 --> 04:17:00,440
Hey.

7074
04:17:00,440 --> 04:17:00,460
Hey.

7075
04:17:01,100 --> 04:17:02,460
I do as I say, not as I do.

7076
04:17:03,080 --> 04:17:03,400
Exactly.

7077
04:17:03,920 --> 04:17:05,620
Hey, I didn't want to put the pressure on you.

7078
04:17:05,660 --> 04:17:07,180
I think we're second seed because you won that.

7079
04:17:07,240 --> 04:17:07,880
Because we were one.

7080
04:17:08,040 --> 04:17:08,180
Yes.

7081
04:17:08,180 --> 04:17:08,340
Wait.

7082
04:17:08,340 --> 04:17:09,160
Are we second seed?

7083
04:17:09,620 --> 04:17:09,980
Because of that?

7084
04:17:09,980 --> 04:17:10,920
I didn't want to say shit.

7085
04:17:10,980 --> 04:17:11,120
No.

7086
04:17:11,260 --> 04:17:12,480
That was the tie breaker.

7087
04:17:12,940 --> 04:17:13,260
Really?

7088
04:17:14,400 --> 04:17:15,100
You got it.

7089
04:17:15,120 --> 04:17:16,300
You got some tie breaker, dude.

7090
04:17:16,420 --> 04:17:17,000
Oh, my God.

7091
04:17:17,060 --> 04:17:19,160
That is why we tell you after you won.

7092
04:17:19,240 --> 04:17:20,220
I didn't want to say it.

7093
04:17:20,560 --> 04:17:22,580
But it's their first seed and we're second.

7094
04:17:23,040 --> 04:17:23,360
Yeah.

7095
04:17:23,440 --> 04:17:23,820
We literally...

7096
04:17:23,820 --> 04:17:26,020
Just like last time, we got a seed.

7097
04:17:26,380 --> 04:17:27,020
We got a one.

7098
04:17:27,180 --> 04:17:27,440
Wait.

7099
04:17:27,480 --> 04:17:28,020
So we get a five?

7100
04:17:28,220 --> 04:17:28,700
I know.

7101
04:17:28,740 --> 04:17:29,560
I was silent.

7102
04:17:31,180 --> 04:17:32,440
You closed the chat, bro.

7103
04:17:32,480 --> 04:17:33,140
Close the chat.

7104
04:17:33,680 --> 04:17:35,340
Coney and I had like a neural link.

7105
04:17:35,440 --> 04:17:37,160
We just knew that it would just not be good to say.

7106
04:17:37,380 --> 04:17:37,540
Yeah.

7107
04:17:37,600 --> 04:17:38,360
Don't say that shit.

7108
04:17:38,560 --> 04:17:39,640
Holy fuck.

7109
04:17:39,800 --> 04:17:40,100
Nice.

7110
04:17:40,160 --> 04:17:41,240
Good fucking shit, dude.

7111
04:17:41,240 --> 04:17:41,820
Oh, my God.

7112
04:17:41,960 --> 04:17:43,860
We literally all performed.

7113
04:17:44,760 --> 04:17:45,120
Yay.

7114
04:17:45,720 --> 04:17:46,360
That was...

7115
04:17:46,360 --> 04:17:47,620
Good fucking shit, guys.

7116
04:17:47,720 --> 04:17:48,300
We turned it off.

7117
04:17:48,300 --> 04:17:48,900
I was so happy.

7118
04:17:49,180 --> 04:17:49,840
I was so happy right now.

7119
04:17:49,840 --> 04:17:50,360
We earned it.

7120
04:17:50,420 --> 04:17:52,000
We earned the fucking second seed, dude.

7121
04:17:52,000 --> 04:17:52,400
Oh, my God.

7122
04:17:52,420 --> 04:17:52,800
We did.

7123
04:17:52,900 --> 04:17:53,860
We came back at the end.

7124
04:17:54,380 --> 04:17:54,740
Yes.

7125
04:17:56,300 --> 04:17:56,880
That's great.

7126
04:17:56,960 --> 04:17:58,940
We don't have to do anything for the first match.

7127
04:17:59,020 --> 04:17:59,440
Let's go.

7128
04:17:59,440 --> 04:17:59,740
Let's go.

7129
04:17:59,920 --> 04:18:00,980
Fucking shit, guys.

7130
04:18:01,180 --> 04:18:01,880
We get to chill.

7131
04:18:02,020 --> 04:18:02,760
We get to scout.

7132
04:18:03,000 --> 04:18:03,040
We get to buy.

7133
04:18:03,760 --> 04:18:04,160
Yep.

7134
04:18:04,280 --> 04:18:05,080
We get to watch.

7135
04:18:06,060 --> 04:18:07,480
Thank God I love watching.

7136
04:18:07,480 --> 04:18:08,220
So proud of you guys, man.

7137
04:18:08,300 --> 04:18:08,700
So proud.

7138
04:18:08,760 --> 04:18:09,600
That was fucking sick.

7139
04:18:09,700 --> 04:18:10,280
Well done.

7140
04:18:10,360 --> 04:18:10,840
That was incredible.

7141
04:18:11,240 --> 04:18:12,060
Everybody came together.

7142
04:18:12,320 --> 04:18:13,020
It was so...

7143
04:18:13,020 --> 04:18:14,600
All the sets were so close too.

7144
04:18:14,760 --> 04:18:15,440
Fuck, man.

7145
04:18:15,560 --> 04:18:16,340
Y'all clutched it.

7146
04:18:16,380 --> 04:18:16,500
Yeah.

7147
04:18:17,560 --> 04:18:18,700
You clutched it, bro.

7148
04:18:18,960 --> 04:18:20,720
And they all trained against us.

7149
04:18:20,780 --> 04:18:22,340
They actually studied us.

7150
04:18:24,020 --> 04:18:24,980
That's true, actually.

7151
04:18:25,060 --> 04:18:25,280
Yeah.

7152
04:18:25,320 --> 04:18:25,900
They did a lot.

7153
04:18:26,000 --> 04:18:26,520
Oh, my God.

7154
04:18:26,520 --> 04:18:26,640
Yeah.

7155
04:18:26,640 --> 04:18:27,660
They actually did their homework.

7156
04:18:27,920 --> 04:18:32,240
Dude, did you know last time the tiebreaker was against MYK also?

7157
04:18:33,780 --> 04:18:34,180
Really?

7158
04:18:34,340 --> 04:18:34,600
Really?

7159
04:18:34,860 --> 04:18:35,920
For the EVO tickets.

7160
04:18:36,020 --> 04:18:36,580
For EVO, yeah.

7161
04:18:37,500 --> 04:18:38,500
That was against the Canada.

7162
04:18:38,500 --> 04:18:38,920
You're just better, bro.

7163
04:18:38,960 --> 04:18:39,780
You're just better.

7164
04:18:41,080 --> 04:18:41,680
All right.

7165
04:18:41,880 --> 04:18:43,600
Yeah, I think we're second seed.

7166
04:18:43,960 --> 04:18:44,360
Nice.

7167
04:18:45,340 --> 04:18:45,740
Wow.

7168
04:18:45,940 --> 04:18:47,560
We got a lot of work to do.

7169
04:18:47,620 --> 04:18:49,200
We got a lot of work to do for tomorrow.

7170
04:18:51,160 --> 04:18:51,880
And this time...

7171
04:18:51,880 --> 04:18:53,860
And this time, Brocko will teach Matt.

7172
04:18:55,380 --> 04:18:56,020
Oh, wait.

7173
04:18:56,040 --> 04:18:56,500
We're third seed.

7174
04:18:56,500 --> 04:18:57,420
Oh, never mind.

7175
04:18:57,460 --> 04:18:57,980
We're third seed.

7176
04:18:58,120 --> 04:18:58,420
Never mind.

7177
04:18:58,600 --> 04:18:58,980
What?

7178
04:18:59,960 --> 04:19:00,560
You're lying.

7179
04:19:00,640 --> 04:19:01,300
After four...

7180
04:19:01,300 --> 04:19:01,940
That's crazy.

7181
04:19:02,180 --> 04:19:04,200
After four-one...

7182
04:19:04,200 --> 04:19:04,440
Okay.

7183
04:19:05,260 --> 04:19:05,800
That's okay.

7184
04:19:05,860 --> 04:19:06,640
We'll cook them.

7185
04:19:06,680 --> 04:19:07,040
That's okay.

7186
04:19:07,420 --> 04:19:08,740
I'm not worried about second or third.

7187
04:19:08,780 --> 04:19:10,880
We play another set, but like, you know...

7188
04:19:10,880 --> 04:19:11,860
Don't worry about it.

7189
04:19:11,900 --> 04:19:12,060
Don't...

7190
04:19:12,060 --> 04:19:13,560
Just imagine we're second seed.

7191
04:19:14,140 --> 04:19:14,520
Okay.

7192
04:19:14,540 --> 04:19:16,880
Never let the King players do math.

7193
04:19:17,120 --> 04:19:17,500
Never.

7194
04:19:18,360 --> 04:19:19,280
Ride the high.

7195
04:19:19,380 --> 04:19:19,780
Ride the high.

7196
04:19:19,980 --> 04:19:20,460
That's true.

7197
04:19:20,580 --> 04:19:21,500
He told me it was second.

7198
04:19:21,620 --> 04:19:22,240
My bad, yo.

7199
04:19:22,420 --> 04:19:23,560
I can't believe it.

7200
04:19:26,500 --> 04:19:27,160
You're right.

7201
04:19:27,360 --> 04:19:28,060
You're right.

7202
04:19:28,120 --> 04:19:29,000
My bad, bro.

7203
04:19:29,120 --> 04:19:30,200
Can't listen to him.

7204
04:19:30,840 --> 04:19:32,080
Second in our heart.

7205
04:19:34,680 --> 04:19:36,480
Unless it comes down like a weird...

7206
04:19:37,420 --> 04:19:37,780
What?

7207
04:19:37,820 --> 04:19:38,000
Yeah.

7208
04:19:38,100 --> 04:19:39,080
What are the points looking like?

7209
04:19:39,120 --> 04:19:39,740
I want to look at them.

7210
04:19:39,760 --> 04:19:39,780
Wait, no.

7211
04:19:39,780 --> 04:19:40,060
Yeah.

7212
04:19:40,140 --> 04:19:41,780
Because we're 14-1.

7213
04:19:43,980 --> 04:19:45,560
We were tied with KFM.

7214
04:19:45,600 --> 04:19:46,180
They're crunching the numbers.

7215
04:19:46,380 --> 04:19:46,420
Oh, wait.

7216
04:19:46,420 --> 04:19:46,680
Tony...

7217
04:19:46,680 --> 04:19:47,100
Yeah.

7218
04:19:47,160 --> 04:19:47,760
They're crunching the numbers.

7219
04:19:47,760 --> 04:19:48,000
Okay.

7220
04:19:48,080 --> 04:19:48,480
We'll see.

7221
04:19:48,580 --> 04:19:49,980
Now SageM confirmed we're second?

7222
04:19:50,160 --> 04:19:51,000
I don't like this.

7223
04:19:51,420 --> 04:19:51,780
Wait.

7224
04:19:51,800 --> 04:19:53,200
Now they could be gaslighting.

7225
04:19:53,200 --> 04:19:53,380
Oh.

7226
04:19:53,400 --> 04:19:53,540
We're tied with KFM.

7227
04:19:53,560 --> 04:19:54,420
Wait!

7228
04:19:54,420 --> 04:19:55,440
Is it Tekken Ball?

7229
04:19:56,000 --> 04:19:56,440
Overall?

7230
04:19:57,680 --> 04:19:58,380
Tekken Ball.

7231
04:19:58,380 --> 04:19:59,900
Let me play Tekken Ball.

7232
04:20:00,480 --> 04:20:03,660
Wait, Seijin messed up.

7233
04:20:03,780 --> 04:20:04,400
Oh, wait, I read chat.

7234
04:20:04,540 --> 04:20:04,900
Stop.

7235
04:20:05,040 --> 04:20:05,260
Stop.

7236
04:20:05,360 --> 04:20:05,500
Stop.

7237
04:20:06,620 --> 04:20:07,200
Hold on.

7238
04:20:07,220 --> 04:20:07,960
I'm banning you, actually.

7239
04:20:08,020 --> 04:20:11,800
If it's Tekken Ball, let me play.

7240
04:20:12,820 --> 04:20:15,060
Wait, yeah, wait.

7241
04:20:15,180 --> 04:20:22,400
If we had more... if we had... if us and MYK had the same amount of points today, but we had one more point Wednesday.

7242
04:20:24,040 --> 04:20:24,520
Right?

7243
04:20:25,460 --> 04:20:28,140
Yeah, yeah, I mean it's additive, so I don't...

7244
04:20:28,140 --> 04:20:29,960
Oh, we're tied for second.

7245
04:20:30,260 --> 04:20:31,340
We're tied for second.

7246
04:20:31,340 --> 04:20:33,500
If it's Tekken Ball, put me on.

7247
04:20:34,600 --> 04:20:39,500
They're saying we're tied for second, but they didn't include yesterday, so we're second, including yesterday's points.

7248
04:20:44,050 --> 04:20:45,410
Apparently that's what Seijin said.

7249
04:20:47,870 --> 04:20:52,070
If me and MYK are tied, we should get it, because I just beat the coach.

7250
04:20:52,170 --> 04:20:52,470
Yeah.

7251
04:20:52,470 --> 04:20:53,330
The coach match just happened.

7252
04:20:54,190 --> 04:20:56,370
I actually get it because it was fucking stressful.

7253
04:20:56,570 --> 04:20:57,990
Wait, second by three points.

7254
04:20:59,010 --> 04:21:00,610
We're second by three points.

7255
04:21:00,870 --> 04:21:00,890
Let's go!

7256
04:21:01,290 --> 04:21:02,030
Three points?

7257
04:21:02,330 --> 04:21:02,890
Let's fucking go!

7258
04:21:04,190 --> 04:21:08,250
Doesn't that mean literally if one of us lost yesterday, then we would've Tekken Balled?

7259
04:21:08,510 --> 04:21:08,990
Yes.

7260
04:21:09,310 --> 04:21:10,190
Oh my god.

7261
04:21:10,770 --> 04:21:12,130
You guys clutched it out yesterday.

7262
04:21:12,350 --> 04:21:12,890
Or two days ago.

7263
04:21:13,030 --> 04:21:15,150
Oh my god, yesterday.

7264
04:21:15,290 --> 04:21:18,210
Yesterday was all that matters, because we got first, last one.

7265
04:21:18,210 --> 04:21:19,590
It literally fucking matters.

7266
04:21:20,410 --> 04:21:21,810
MYK's in third now.

7267
04:21:21,810 --> 04:21:22,690
Yay!

7268
04:21:23,810 --> 04:21:25,270
Wait, who do we play against then?

7269
04:21:25,370 --> 04:21:26,470
I was just a rollercoaster.

7270
04:21:26,470 --> 04:21:28,430
I was so ready to Tekken Ball it up, dude.

7271
04:21:28,470 --> 04:21:30,810
I got strategies that I don't even wanna talk about.

7272
04:21:31,330 --> 04:21:34,130
I don't wanna tell you guys just how much I grinded that shit.

7273
04:21:34,470 --> 04:21:35,770
Wednesday actually mattered.

7274
04:21:35,830 --> 04:21:36,470
Three point diff.

7275
04:21:36,690 --> 04:21:37,250
That's crazy.

7276
04:21:37,310 --> 04:21:38,650
Literally a one game difference.

7277
04:21:39,010 --> 04:21:42,850
That literally means everyone who won, like, Good fucking shit.

7278
04:21:44,130 --> 04:21:45,010
Everyone matters.

7279
04:21:45,030 --> 04:21:46,510
Good fucking shit.

7280
04:21:46,790 --> 04:21:47,150
Let's go.

7281
04:21:48,230 --> 04:21:52,110
This is so sick, because like, everyone on the team, like, it contributes.

7282
04:21:52,370 --> 04:21:53,170
Not just the team.

7283
04:21:54,150 --> 04:21:55,910
Oh, I can hear Josh talking.

7284
04:21:55,910 --> 04:21:57,710
So when is someone gonna name drop Super?

7285
04:21:59,490 --> 04:21:59,930
Oh.

7286
04:22:00,090 --> 04:22:02,050
Already a lot bigger streak than that.

7287
04:22:02,230 --> 04:22:04,170
Already one more case than Super.

7288
04:22:05,510 --> 04:22:06,050
I love the guy.

7289
04:22:06,050 --> 04:22:06,590
I love the guy.

7290
04:22:06,710 --> 04:22:10,310
But I feel like the Doki Bird special, the Alley Kick special, that's gonna be good.

7291
04:22:10,310 --> 04:22:10,510
Oh yeah.

7292
04:22:10,990 --> 04:22:15,170
As soon as we learn to block that Yoshi, the spin of Rudy bullshit, it's easy.

7293
04:22:15,470 --> 04:22:16,150
Yeah, yeah.

7294
04:22:16,550 --> 04:22:17,050
Easy jumps.

7295
04:22:17,050 --> 04:22:17,050
Easy jumps.

7296
04:22:17,150 --> 04:22:18,010
Block that, it's over.

7297
04:22:18,090 --> 04:22:18,950
I can Alley Kick forever.

7298
04:22:24,690 --> 04:22:27,430
You think they're gonna learn how to block the Alley Kick, guys?

7299
04:22:28,290 --> 04:22:30,870
We were only two points away from first also.

7300
04:22:31,310 --> 04:22:32,050
Oh shit.

7301
04:22:32,330 --> 04:22:34,970
Yeah, if we won one more set against them.

7302
04:22:35,070 --> 04:22:36,430
But I mean, first or second doesn't...

7303
04:22:36,430 --> 04:22:39,010
It doesn't matter, right?

7304
04:22:39,270 --> 04:22:41,710
We're just on the other side of the bracket, from my understanding.

7305
04:22:45,130 --> 04:22:46,370
Does it matter?

7306
04:22:46,430 --> 04:22:47,130
We're first or second?

7307
04:22:47,150 --> 04:22:50,650
If I'm like, hey, our third seed, then we just 4-1'd them.

7308
04:22:51,070 --> 04:22:53,030
So like, you know, we're not in a bad spot.

7309
04:22:57,020 --> 04:23:00,700
I'm gonna ask Stage 1, see if anyone wants to play Tekken this month.

7310
04:23:00,940 --> 04:23:06,720
And also, we don't have... once the bracket comes out, we don't have to focus on like five characters.

7311
04:23:06,840 --> 04:23:08,700
Cause we gotta buy.

7312
04:23:08,920 --> 04:23:09,260
Yeah.

7313
04:23:09,520 --> 04:23:11,280
Maybe we might?

7314
04:23:11,680 --> 04:23:12,840
With the loser bracket?

7315
04:23:12,940 --> 04:23:14,720
I don't know actually how that works.

7316
04:23:14,860 --> 04:23:17,160
We'll start to prepare, yeah, for whatever comes up.

7317
04:23:18,620 --> 04:23:19,060
Yeah.

7318
04:23:19,280 --> 04:23:21,880
I think it's mathematically we'll be less characters to focus on.

7319
04:23:22,620 --> 04:23:25,500
The moment you teach me how to block, I'm unstoppable.

7320
04:23:26,540 --> 04:23:27,200
Yeah, I know.

7321
04:23:27,340 --> 04:23:28,360
Yeah, we'll do all that.

7322
04:23:29,340 --> 04:23:33,580
Like it'll be a read, but by definition, we have to lab against like at least one less team.

7323
04:23:34,460 --> 04:23:35,160
Like it'll be a read, but by definition, we have to lab against like at least one less team.

7324
04:23:36,280 --> 04:23:37,680
Oh, good shit guys.

7325
04:23:37,800 --> 04:23:38,460
Well done today.

7326
04:23:38,760 --> 04:23:39,200
Seriously.

7327
04:23:39,760 --> 04:23:40,400
Hell yeah.

7328
04:23:40,500 --> 04:23:40,920
Wow.

7329
04:23:41,400 --> 04:23:41,840
Crazy.

7330
04:23:43,260 --> 04:23:46,600
This is really like rough on the mental, I'm not gonna lie.

7331
04:23:46,600 --> 04:23:47,140
This is really like rough on the mental, I'm not gonna lie.

7332
04:23:47,160 --> 04:23:49,040
This one ironically hurts.

7333
04:23:50,280 --> 04:23:52,280
And the thing is like, I don't know.

7334
04:23:52,700 --> 04:23:53,660
It's just pride.

7335
04:23:53,900 --> 04:23:54,920
Cause like we're already going.

7336
04:23:55,720 --> 04:23:57,480
You don't need to leave here alone bro.

7337
04:23:57,480 --> 04:23:58,760
Excuse me, I'm here too.

7338
04:24:00,220 --> 04:24:02,120
You just don't wanna let your friends down.

7339
04:24:02,260 --> 04:24:02,960
It's so hard.

7340
04:24:03,280 --> 04:24:05,700
I don't wanna let you guys down, you know?

7341
04:24:05,820 --> 04:24:07,400
I mean, but like at the same time.

7342
04:24:08,340 --> 04:24:09,040
Doesn't matter.

7343
04:24:09,800 --> 04:24:10,960
Yeah, we're already going.

7344
04:24:11,300 --> 04:24:12,040
Wait, excuse me.

7345
04:24:12,060 --> 04:24:12,320
Hello?

7346
04:24:12,320 --> 04:24:12,980
Guys, hello?

7347
04:24:13,000 --> 04:24:14,000
The chat is paying for it.

7348
04:24:14,340 --> 04:24:14,760
Hello?

7349
04:24:17,560 --> 04:24:21,220
We can create a fucking like a little thing, a group thing.

7350
04:24:21,380 --> 04:24:21,960
We'll just all pick.

7351
04:24:22,840 --> 04:24:24,000
Cause you're part of the team too.

7352
04:24:25,300 --> 04:24:25,660
True.

7353
04:24:25,660 --> 04:24:26,920
Yeah, let's do it for Doki though.

7354
04:24:27,040 --> 04:24:27,840
That's the first option.

7355
04:24:28,020 --> 04:24:31,320
Then we'll do a donation drive for a millionaire after.

7356
04:24:32,160 --> 04:24:33,960
First option is we try and get top two.

7357
04:24:34,080 --> 04:24:35,720
I'm not gonna use my own money.

7358
04:24:38,000 --> 04:24:39,940
Lost my two points for one by two points.

7359
04:24:40,980 --> 04:24:41,140
Lost my two points for one by two points.

7360
04:24:41,140 --> 04:24:44,560
I would have loved to beat Josh's team so bad.

7361
04:24:44,560 --> 04:24:44,620
I would have loved to beat Josh's team so bad.

7362
04:24:44,740 --> 04:24:46,420
If you beat Josh bro, we would have been first seed.

7363
04:24:48,520 --> 04:24:50,200
I lost to his coach too.

7364
04:24:50,200 --> 04:24:51,560
No, it is just his fault.

7365
04:24:51,560 --> 04:24:53,320
It's okay, I choked too guys.

7366
04:24:53,440 --> 04:24:54,040
It's okay.

7367
04:24:54,280 --> 04:24:56,640
We all, each of us choked at least once guys.

7368
04:24:56,740 --> 04:24:57,200
It's okay.

7369
04:24:57,540 --> 04:24:58,680
It's a team effort.

7370
04:25:00,180 --> 04:25:02,160
That's a second though as a team effort.

7371
04:25:02,280 --> 04:25:02,760
Yeah, yeah.

7372
04:25:03,320 --> 04:25:05,320
My chat is saying give her supers ticket.

7373
04:25:05,820 --> 04:25:07,240
That's what my chat is saying too.

7374
04:25:07,360 --> 04:25:08,440
That's what I'm saying dude.

7375
04:25:08,880 --> 04:25:09,860
Drop it over.

7376
04:25:10,040 --> 04:25:12,600
Make super pay for his own ticket.

7377
04:25:13,620 --> 04:25:16,980
I gave away my first ticket cause I already had an evil fucking...

7378
04:25:16,980 --> 04:25:18,400
Like I already had a ticket.

7379
04:25:18,620 --> 04:25:19,560
Oh, what the fuck?

7380
04:25:20,080 --> 04:25:22,460
Yeah, I was like here SageM, just give it to someone else.

7381
04:25:22,620 --> 04:25:25,280
SageM saves money if we win.

7382
04:25:25,540 --> 04:25:25,940
Yeah.

7383
04:25:26,260 --> 04:25:29,160
So it's in his interest to rig the bracket.

7384
04:25:29,460 --> 04:25:30,160
Oh, that's true.

7385
04:25:30,240 --> 04:25:30,580
That's true.

7386
04:25:30,620 --> 04:25:32,000
Look at how close we were dude.

7387
04:25:32,080 --> 04:25:34,000
Oh my god, we were so close.

7388
04:25:35,180 --> 04:25:36,480
That's crazy man.

7389
04:25:36,640 --> 04:25:39,100
If by knock on wood, not gonna happen.

7390
04:25:39,320 --> 04:25:43,520
But if we don't get top two, we'll all pitch in and get Doki Da Ivo too.

7391
04:25:43,840 --> 04:25:44,240
Yeah.

7392
04:25:44,240 --> 04:25:48,580
Because I mean, clutch master Doki, literally every match mattered.

7393
04:25:49,380 --> 04:25:50,940
Doki clutched that shit.

7394
04:25:51,180 --> 04:25:51,360
Yeah.

7395
04:25:51,540 --> 04:25:54,060
Wait, did my set count?

7396
04:25:54,540 --> 04:25:55,200
Yeah.

7397
04:25:55,960 --> 04:25:58,720
Every win counted.

7398
04:25:58,900 --> 04:25:59,800
Every win.

7399
04:25:59,960 --> 04:26:01,260
I got sets.

7400
04:26:02,010 --> 04:26:03,560
There's no way I don't...

7401
04:26:03,560 --> 04:26:04,900
You deserve to be an Ivo.

7402
04:26:05,060 --> 04:26:07,300
I got points from SK.

7403
04:26:07,860 --> 04:26:10,040
Yeah, you literally farmed.

7404
04:26:10,260 --> 04:26:10,440
Yeah.

7405
04:26:12,300 --> 04:26:14,020
Well, every snap mattered.

7406
04:26:14,240 --> 04:26:16,300
I don't think every match, right?

7407
04:26:16,660 --> 04:26:17,460
How did it work?

7408
04:26:17,500 --> 04:26:18,900
Every match turns into every set.

7409
04:26:18,960 --> 04:26:19,860
And every set matters.

7410
04:26:22,200 --> 04:26:24,160
So you got points off the guys you beat?

7411
04:26:24,440 --> 04:26:24,720
Yeah.

7412
04:26:25,200 --> 04:26:27,420
Wait, off the points I got sets off?

7413
04:26:28,280 --> 04:26:28,680
Yeah.

7414
04:26:29,120 --> 04:26:30,840
So how many people did you beat in a set?

7415
04:26:31,060 --> 04:26:32,100
It was like a couple, right?

7416
04:26:33,960 --> 04:26:37,340
I beat Amore, but then I got set off SK and Gumi.

7417
04:26:38,160 --> 04:26:39,760
You went like, what?

7418
04:26:39,940 --> 04:26:41,260
2-3, 3-2, yeah.

7419
04:26:41,380 --> 04:26:41,680
Yeah.

7420
04:26:44,240 --> 04:26:44,680
I'm like, I'm a difference maker.

7421
04:26:44,880 --> 04:26:45,460
Like, it's crazy.

7422
04:26:45,620 --> 04:26:46,000
Woo!

7423
04:26:49,080 --> 04:26:53,260
That King Heat match when he's growling.

7424
04:26:53,840 --> 04:26:54,340
Yay!

7425
04:26:55,640 --> 04:26:56,540
That's a good clip.

7426
04:26:57,000 --> 04:26:57,860
That was a really...

7427
04:26:57,860 --> 04:26:59,520
It was like right as he looked into the camera.

7428
04:27:00,060 --> 04:27:01,340
It was very funny.

7429
04:27:02,660 --> 04:27:04,120
Did you see it?

7430
04:27:04,120 --> 04:27:04,840
Did you see the clip?

7431
04:27:05,480 --> 04:27:07,460
Chat, send me the clip, please.

7432
04:27:07,500 --> 04:27:09,220
It's extremely fucking funny.

7433
04:27:09,400 --> 04:27:10,820
My POV...

7434
04:27:10,820 --> 04:27:11,980
Yeah, hold on, here you go.

7435
04:27:12,040 --> 04:27:13,040
I'm gonna post it in the thing.

7436
04:27:13,160 --> 04:27:17,140
It is extremely good.

7437
04:27:17,300 --> 04:27:17,720
Hold on.

7438
04:27:19,160 --> 04:27:20,320
Here you go.

7439
04:27:20,380 --> 04:27:20,820
Watch this.

7440
04:27:20,960 --> 04:27:21,760
Put this on stream.

7441
04:27:22,640 --> 04:27:23,140
Yay!

7442
04:27:24,580 --> 04:27:25,080
Title!

7443
04:27:29,540 --> 04:27:30,040
Alright.

7444
04:27:31,380 --> 04:27:33,380
I'm gonna go get food.

7445
04:27:33,620 --> 04:27:35,060
Congratulations, everyone.

7446
04:27:35,480 --> 04:27:36,480
Holy fucking...

7447
04:27:37,300 --> 04:27:38,020
Where'd it go?

7448
04:27:38,020 --> 04:27:38,720
Are you just reading?

7449
04:27:39,640 --> 04:27:40,980
Yeah, I mean like...

7450
04:27:41,480 --> 04:27:43,340
Uncle, are you staying live?

7451
04:27:44,180 --> 04:27:44,560
Me?

7452
04:27:45,420 --> 04:27:46,800
I mean, what am I gonna do?

7453
04:27:46,860 --> 04:27:48,840
I guess I'll stay live for like 30 minutes or something.

7454
04:27:49,020 --> 04:27:49,220
Sure.

7455
04:27:49,300 --> 04:27:49,560
Alright.

7456
04:27:49,880 --> 04:27:51,560
We'll give BrawlPro...

7457
04:27:52,820 --> 04:27:54,320
I'll send BrawlPro the rate, bro.

7458
04:27:54,740 --> 04:27:55,460
You sound so enthusiastic.

7459
04:27:56,100 --> 04:27:56,340
Coach!

7460
04:27:57,700 --> 04:27:59,800
Hold on, let me get my 90 second ad ready.

7461
04:27:59,900 --> 04:28:00,140
Hold on.

7462
04:28:00,540 --> 04:28:01,280
Oh yeah, yeah.

7463
04:28:01,280 --> 04:28:02,200
Get the ad revenue.

7464
04:28:02,960 --> 04:28:03,420
I'm ready.

7465
04:28:03,600 --> 04:28:03,720
I'm ready.

7466
04:28:04,180 --> 04:28:05,220
Alright, good shit, bro.

7467
04:28:05,360 --> 04:28:05,880
Alright, guys.

7468
04:28:08,240 --> 04:28:09,340
See you in two days.

7469
04:28:09,740 --> 04:28:10,480
GG's, guys.

7470
04:28:10,520 --> 04:28:11,940
We'll train, bro.

7471
04:28:12,100 --> 04:28:12,500
Let's get it.

7472
04:28:12,500 --> 04:28:14,140
We're gonna train for real.

7473
04:28:14,720 --> 04:28:17,400
You can see me in purple rank.

7474
04:28:19,520 --> 04:28:20,000
GG's.

7475
04:28:21,580 --> 04:28:22,660
Oh my god!

7476
04:28:23,020 --> 04:28:23,500
Guys!

7477
04:28:23,640 --> 04:28:24,780
We got second!

7478
04:28:27,080 --> 04:28:28,900
SK and Gumi!

7479
04:28:29,540 --> 04:28:30,500
It's an improvement!

7480
04:28:31,140 --> 04:28:33,020
I gotta say almost everybody!

7481
04:28:33,980 --> 04:28:36,720
Oh my god, BrawlPro is fucking jamming it out right now.

7482
04:28:37,520 --> 04:28:39,400
Guys, SK in the finals.

7483
04:28:39,960 --> 04:28:41,800
We're definitely gonna have our new PC.

7484
04:28:42,140 --> 04:28:46,040
And the shackles will be off for real.

7485
04:28:47,820 --> 04:28:51,620
And we got RedRank on stream too!

7486
04:28:52,680 --> 04:28:53,280
Guys!

7487
04:28:53,460 --> 04:28:54,920
We got RedRank on stream!

7488
04:28:56,900 --> 04:28:59,880
To be fair, I feel like I've been...

7489
04:28:59,880 --> 04:29:03,320
I honestly feel like I brute-forced RedRank.

7490
04:29:03,480 --> 04:29:07,100
Because all I did was just do the moves I know and then leave.

7491
04:29:11,540 --> 04:29:12,720
I just...

7492
04:29:12,720 --> 04:29:13,600
I just...

7493
04:29:13,600 --> 04:29:14,700
I just...

7494
04:29:14,700 --> 04:29:19,660
I just do like the most tilting fucking moves that nobody has ever seen before.

7495
04:29:19,800 --> 04:29:21,120
I call it the Doki Special.

7496
04:29:21,380 --> 04:29:24,620
With five alley kicks and then into a hop kick.

7497
04:29:27,360 --> 04:29:28,000
Red...

7498
04:29:28,000 --> 04:29:29,520
Red is red.

7499
04:29:29,980 --> 04:29:34,200
These people in those ranks did not know what they saw.

7500
04:29:35,860 --> 04:29:38,760
These people in those ranks did not know what they saw.

7501
04:29:38,760 --> 04:29:40,800
I'm pretty sure I tilted a lot of people.

7502
04:29:40,900 --> 04:29:47,460
I was so surprised that the match against SK was so close because she had so many hours ahead of me.

7503
04:29:47,500 --> 04:29:49,940
I hard grinded the last this week.

7504
04:29:50,140 --> 04:29:52,980
But SK still had so many hours ahead of me.

7505
04:29:53,040 --> 04:29:55,120
Everybody had so many hours ahead of me.

7506
04:29:56,640 --> 04:29:58,220
Throughout this tournament.

7507
04:29:58,440 --> 04:30:02,460
So I felt like I definitely grew a lot in such a short amount of time.

7508
04:30:02,880 --> 04:30:04,540
And I did!

7509
04:30:04,540 --> 04:30:06,040
I don't like... I don't defend.

7510
04:30:06,240 --> 04:30:07,300
I just go in YOLO.

7511
04:30:10,080 --> 04:30:11,600
The mind game.

7512
04:30:12,500 --> 04:30:13,460
The mind game.

7513
04:30:13,700 --> 04:30:17,460
I feel like I caught up really fast in the short amount of hours.

7514
04:30:17,600 --> 04:30:22,200
I think I have like 30 hours in total at the moment in Tekken for now.

7515
04:30:22,420 --> 04:30:23,460
But I'm pretty like...

7516
04:30:24,140 --> 04:30:26,060
And it's my first fighting game.

7517
04:30:26,260 --> 04:30:28,640
So I'm really happy with my progress so far.

7518
04:30:28,800 --> 04:30:30,740
Like I never expected to get red rank at all.

7519
04:30:30,880 --> 04:30:33,900
So I'm super happy with my progress!

7520
04:30:35,080 --> 04:30:40,560
And I honestly think the moment I learned how to block it's fucking over for everybody.

7521
04:30:40,800 --> 04:30:43,040
That's my only problem!

7522
04:30:43,540 --> 04:30:48,320
The moment I learned to block and I become more patient it's over.

7523
04:30:48,660 --> 04:30:50,500
I figured it out.

7524
04:30:50,720 --> 04:30:52,760
Because I win the mental game.

7525
04:30:53,100 --> 04:30:56,760
Like I win the mind games off of people.

7526
04:30:57,040 --> 04:31:00,880
Because when they fight against me it's so... I can feel the rage.

7527
04:31:01,180 --> 04:31:04,520
I can feel people being really angry when they're fighting against me.

7528
04:31:04,540 --> 04:31:06,580
Because my moves are so fucking bullshit.

7529
04:31:06,860 --> 04:31:07,420
Like...

7530
04:31:11,500 --> 04:31:13,360
My moves are so...

7531
04:31:13,360 --> 04:31:14,540
My moves are so...

7532
04:31:14,540 --> 04:31:14,740
bullshit.

7533
04:31:15,460 --> 04:31:17,900
And I can tell people are very mad.

7534
04:31:21,180 --> 04:31:23,020
You see them getting more aggressive?

7535
04:31:23,320 --> 04:31:24,000
Oh hell yeah.

7536
04:31:24,120 --> 04:31:24,400
Oh hell yeah.

7537
04:31:24,400 --> 04:31:28,060
I can feel that they're deafening and like going hard focused.

7538
04:31:28,440 --> 04:31:29,520
I can feel it.

7539
04:31:29,660 --> 04:31:32,740
I just need to learn how to block and it's over.

7540
04:31:33,380 --> 04:31:36,340
Block, alley kick, alley kick, jump kick, bam.

7541
04:31:36,780 --> 04:31:37,260
Done.

7542
04:31:37,680 --> 04:31:39,100
They better learn.

7543
04:31:41,100 --> 04:31:41,900
Hey guys!

7544
04:31:42,000 --> 04:31:44,920
I hope you guys enjoyed today's event.

7545
04:31:45,020 --> 04:31:46,440
We got second place overall!

7546
04:31:46,820 --> 04:31:48,040
It was so close too.

7547
04:31:48,180 --> 04:31:49,020
We're second place overall.

7548
04:31:49,260 --> 04:31:50,780
I'm really proud of my team.

7549
04:31:50,880 --> 04:31:55,500
And I'm happy that my sets actually contributed to...

7550
04:31:55,500 --> 04:31:58,080
Because I thought since I only won one game that was it.

7551
04:31:58,140 --> 04:31:59,200
I only contributed one game.

7552
04:31:59,200 --> 04:32:02,160
But I'm happy that my sets actually mattered.

7553
04:32:02,460 --> 04:32:05,560
And it actually contributed into the score overall.

7554
04:32:05,880 --> 04:32:10,960
So I'm glad that I'm happy that it actually helped the team with the score.

7555
04:32:11,160 --> 04:32:11,760
So yay!

7556
04:32:11,960 --> 04:32:13,540
Because I didn't lose both sets.

7557
04:32:13,840 --> 04:32:16,500
I won one out of a set.

7558
04:32:16,700 --> 04:32:18,180
Which is why I'm happy.

7559
04:32:20,900 --> 04:32:21,660
Hey guys!

7560
04:32:21,920 --> 04:32:22,760
I'm gonna call it a day.

7561
04:32:22,840 --> 04:32:24,600
I'm gonna relax a little bit.

7562
04:32:24,620 --> 04:32:26,240
Get some behind the scenes work done.

7563
04:32:27,000 --> 04:32:28,960
And then I'll start training again tomorrow.

7564
04:32:29,200 --> 04:32:30,920
As always everybody stay hydrated.

7565
04:32:31,440 --> 04:32:31,980
Posture check.

7566
04:32:32,020 --> 04:32:33,580
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

7567
04:32:33,760 --> 04:32:34,380
Any of you?

7568
04:32:35,340 --> 04:32:36,100
Stay up for me?

7569
04:32:36,220 --> 04:32:36,800
Head to bed!

7570
04:32:36,900 --> 04:32:37,840
Because you deserve it!

7571
04:32:37,960 --> 04:32:38,860
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

7572
04:32:39,380 --> 04:32:39,980
Bye guys!

7573
04:32:41,120 --> 04:32:41,480
Bye!
