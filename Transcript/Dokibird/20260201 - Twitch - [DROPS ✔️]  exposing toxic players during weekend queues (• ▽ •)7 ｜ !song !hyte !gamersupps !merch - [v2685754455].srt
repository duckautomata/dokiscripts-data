1
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:56,590
hello everybody hello hello i wasn't planning on streaming
today but i decided to play a couple of games of rivals

2
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:04,090
during my little break of doing some work behind the scenes
i'm sorry manager um i'm sorry to my manager if he is

3
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:16,330
watching i don't know um because i was supposed to record a
couple of things and then i got mad i got mad because um i

4
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,830
forgot today's Saturday.

5
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:28,590
And because on Saturday, all the lowlifes, not all of them,
but a lot of like low life players emerge during the weekend

6
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,110
queues.

7
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,830
And these type of players are a very special breed of
gamers.

8
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:41,970
And, um, and they like to do really crazy things during
queues.

9
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:52,750
Yes, I'm very toxic right now because i was very mad i've
never been this mad before in rivals because i felt like all

10
00:02:52,750 --> 00:03:03,530
right this is how i feel like um yes i am unhinged today but
i'm also on twitch so it's fine um so basically um the game

11
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:10,090
the first the first two games were pretty like i won't say i
just played i think like three games um i think the first

12
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,990
game and the third game was pretty bad um But then I was
just like, oh, first game, I was just like, oh, Entina, it

13
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,750
was my first game.

14
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,970
I didn't, I never warm up.

15
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,750
I just go in.

16
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,890
And the third, the, their third game, it was pretty bad.

17
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:32,050
At first, like, you know, like, it was just, it was just, it
was just gaming.

18
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,130
And then the DPS started fucking flaming me and the other
support.

19
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:45,570
And then even though I fucking saw one of DPS flanking from
goddamn Nania while we were all dying um anyway and then

20
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:55,730
wasn't it funny the other deep support was a duo with the
other dps player and whoever they were was chatband oh i

21
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:03,930
wonder why they were chatband i've been playing this game
for since launch never been chatband why the fuck were you

22
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:15,310
chatband anyway so his duo was talking for him and then the
other support shifted the blame onto me and then was like i

23
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:25,470
don't know about dokeybird though and then i was like the
fuck why are you shifting the blame on me and then like i

24
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:38,470
thought we end this together support for life you know like
i was like bro what the fuck we I thought we in this

25
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:47,290
together also to that one guy I saw you're trying to make a
career out of your out of rivals you ain't making it kid

26
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:54,110
when you're hard stuck down here and your peak is lower than
mine to the guy who fucking was consistently flaming me I'll

27
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:02,570
tell you guys I'm not gonna show his Twitter because like

28
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:10,410

tell you right now you ain't making it kid if your peak is

29
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,890
lower than mine and i'm not and i'm not even playing this
game every day like

30
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:26,810
i play this game as a fucking hobby and if you are trying to
lft and trying to fucking make it as a pro and your peak is

31
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:36,230
lower than mine and not even at a hundred eternity by the
way that's sad had so many seasons to get to eternity at

32
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:45,010
least a hundred since like the by the beginning of the
season easiest shit can't even get it and you're trying to

33
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:57,370
be pro like bro i'm sorry buddy it ain't the team's fault it
might be you like if you're lower than me and i play this as

34
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:06,590
a hobby whenever i have time as a variety streamer i'm sorry
buddy Trying to put LFT trialing out for all these teams,

35
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,770

two?

36
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,590
I'm sorry, buddy.

37
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,950
It ain't the team.

38
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,170
It ain't your support.

39
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,730
It might be you.

40
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,430
And your fucking poor ass attitude, by the way.

41
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,950
Oh, and your fucking sexism, too, as well.

42
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,590
Forgot to mention your fucking sexism.

43
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,950
I wonder if, you know, maybe change that attitude of yours.

44
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:32,810
Anyway.

45
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,990
Anyway, continuing the story.

46
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,070
Continuing the story.

47
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,090
Stop, he is already dead.

48
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,010
No, I got it.

49
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,110
Anyway, sorry, I'm on hand-trained.

50
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,450
I've never been, like, this angry before because I was
literally, like, like, they were just hard, like, just

51
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,950
because, like, I think it's because of the Kingsman drama.

52
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:07,030
So it gave them an excuse to, it gave them an excuse to,
like, because I used my mic because I wanted them to stop

53
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,170
because it was so bad.

54
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,770
It was so fucking bad.

55
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,390
And I used my mic to be like, stop.

56
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,930
Like I solo, I solo queueed here.

57
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:24,350
Like I'm not dueled with anyone because the guy, the guy
that started the whole like bandwagon on me, like he, like

58
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:29,550
him got two other guys to nonstop shit talk me in that game.

59
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,090
And I was like, I wish I was live right now.

60
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:39,050
fucked up and and then they're like oh are you and then when
i tried to defend myself i was like stop i don't think you

61
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:45,890
know who we were talking to because i was like please look
me up i stream my solo queue stuff um and then they like

62
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:51,950
they're like uh they made fun of my voice they made fun of
that i was a female player and they're like oh you're just

63
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:58,870
trying to play the victim right now or are you doing victim
mentality at the moment and i was like bro you guys started

64
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:06,930
it because the first thing they said to me was whoever
boosted dokeybird to this rank wow i bet i hope that guy is

65
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:17,030
paying you double i didn't say nothing by the way they said
that second second thing was like um this is all man wow

66
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:23,710
this is your first time here i'm sorry wow wow i'm so
threatened this is your first time in this elo solo queuing

67
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:33,630
up here and then i was just like okay and then i went i just
like I am not so I like because I went Mike and was like I'm

68
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:40,950
not doing it anymore and I'm still right now and then uh and
then and then they're like they were making fun of my voice

69
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:46,930
they like they started making fun of my voice and then they
were like uh they're like oh you're just I don't because

70
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,810
they they were like oh Kingsman's just going hard right now
because we have a female play and she doesn't know what

71
00:08:52,810 --> 00:09:03,330
they're she's doing and like it was just like it was so much
That's what, like, I hate about this whole situation with

72
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:11,410
this drama because it gave people, like, they ignore the
bigger picture of what the drama really is.

73
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:17,250
And, like, and they use it as an excuse to make fun of other
female players.

74
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:22,290
And it didn't help that I was actually, the enemy team was
Kingsman.

75
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:29,110
And they used that excuse to rag on other female players
because it has happened in other games as well.

76
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:39,170
it makes them feel justified in blaming female players even
though i didn't say anything at first i was trying to ignore

77
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:48,570
them and then the other support player targeted like threw
the target onto me and then three other guys started ganging

78
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:57,290
up on me and then when i used my mic they were just laughing
at me and then i straight up was like just look me up like

79
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:06,090
because they were saying even though I literally streamed
all the climb here in the last for this season and

80
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:16,910
everything too and um and then they were like uh and like
literally like playing playing it all by like on this season

81
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:27,190
on solo queue like without dueling with anyone um almost
being like on top at top 500 and then and then they were

82
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:32,990
like wow you think you're somewhat and then in my head it
was like they don't know like and I checked I was like oh

83
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:46,890
all these people that you idolize they follow me I was like
I when I'm mad I like looked in I was like all those players

84
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,130
all those pros that you fucking idolize, they follow me.

85
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,350
Yeah, and I honestly, I feel like it was just, it was so
bad.

86
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:10,650
I feel like the rivals, the rivals rank community is so bad
now.

87
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,990
It's actually, it makes me so sad.

88
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,730
It makes me so fucking sad that it's just so toxic now.

89
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:31,010
like the same um the same level almost the same level as
valorant anyway let me show you guys fuck this guy fuck this

90
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:41,850
guy fuck that guy and also fuck him cat women stayed quiet
throughout it you cool in my book like especially fuck this

91
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,050

95
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:24,250

try to blame the dps or k we don't throw each other under

96
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:31,710

reason like

97
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:50,330

100
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:23,050

hobby but if you fucking flame me i'm gonna turn on my

101
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:37,680
stream because at least at least like my chat has my back at
least yeah yeah bro you can cross that's the golden rule

102
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:50,700
it's the golden rule don't throw your support partner under
the bus bro also fucking crazy by the way the two the and

103
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:57,900
all the support was duode and then i think the dps was
awesome i don't know the support player was duode with the

104
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:08,560
dps player yet somehow they were make yet somehow they need
a duo to get to this rank yet somehow i solo queued on

105
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:18,040
stream not even paying like attention fully because i have
the balance talking to chat while playing the game yet you

106
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:25,800
need to duo to be here and yet you're you're talking about
how like who boosted you and dueled with you to get to this

107
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:37,890
elo and i'm like look in the fucking mirror bro you're doing
that right now like yeah like wow

108
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:48,910
actual bozos anyway let's queue up rank and beat up children
i gotta let out this anger on

109
00:14:54,190 --> 00:15:15,050
game all right all right time to continue the cycle time to
continue the cycle all right here we go all right let that

110
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:21,370
out i mean if you feel so confident doing that behind the
screen and yet also trying to make it and have a very public

111
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:29,170
uh social meaning like of trying to have a public presence
and trying to make it as pro in this game maybe think before

112
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:40,750
you fucking maybe think before you fucking shit talk people
and remember who you're shit talking to think about your

113
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:55,070
actions uh oh yeah i gotta change my thing i gotta make it
full screen you want to be a public persona if you want to

114
00:15:55,070 --> 00:16:06,550
be a public persona you gotta be very careful with what you
say publicly because it all comes back eventually it's why

115
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:18,850
it's why i have no opinion on anything except for i guess a
lot of things but they're more not but i would never if i

116
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,850
know someone is a public figure I won't say anything.

117
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:31,350
Your online paper trail will always come back.

118
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,190
I said in game.

119
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,000
That's different.

120
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,330
All right.

121
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,190
All right, children.

122
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,230
Let's go.

123
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,330
All right, children.

124
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,070
Where are they?

125
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,130
Ah, Mr. Rocket.

126
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,870
Let's do it.

127
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,290
God damn it.

128
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,910
Everybody's closing pub doors now.

129
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,630
Those who have public profiles.

130
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,230
It's like they figured it out.

131
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:03,810
No!

132
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,670
They know about my reputation now.

133
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,090
They know I frequent here whenever I'm mad.

134
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:23,170
Whenever I'm mad, I come here.

135
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,710
They heard about the local bully at the playground.

136
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,350
Yeah.

137
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,710
They really did.

138
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,410
Oh my god.

139
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,950
Wait, I'm currently matchmaking?

140
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,270
What do you mean?

141
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,490
I'm trying to do it.

142
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,210
Wait, can I not do it when I'm matchmaking anymore?

143
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,630
Has that always been a thing?

144
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:47,350
Oh.

145
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,230
Oh, I didn't realize.

146
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,630
Oh, what's the point?

147
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,270
What's the point?

148
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:54,730
What?

149
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,090
Alright, wait, let's cancel queue.

150
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,370
This guy, this guy found the perfect target.

151
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,290
Let's get out of this queue real quick.

152
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:04,750
Here we go.

153
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,590
No, I found...

154
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,910
I need a warm-up, guys.

155
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,010
I need a warm-up.

156
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,480
No, wait.

157
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,280
Who are you?

158
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,600
No, sorry.

159
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,960
I send the invites.

160
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,840
Not you.

161
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,780
I sent the invites.

162
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,720
Oh, was it this guy?

163
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,580
Wait, where is he?

164
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,180
Did he send that invite?

165
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,200
I gotta warm up, guys.

166
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,300
This is a warm up.

167
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,230
I gotta warm up.

168
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,250
Gotta find the perfect victim.

169
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,330
This is not the way.

170
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,830
The cycle will always continue.

171
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,380
But yeah, that's what...

172
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:11,940
That's the only...

173
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,520
Like, that's the only thing I really hate about the outcome
of that drama.

174
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,020
It lets people use this as an excuse.

175
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,700
Like, it could be, like, a very tiny minority.

176
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,860
I'm going to try the low-key strat.

177
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,900
It's, like, a tiny minority of people.

178
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,560
But the fact that some people are using that as an excuse.

179
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,140
Oh, no.

180
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,540
That's the worst matchup of...

181
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,720
Oh, no.

182
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,990
Time to vanish.

183
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,200
Yeah?

184
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,190
I love Loki.

185
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,670
Um...

186
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,020
You see it?

187
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,700
Yes, so self-re-you see it.

188
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,160
I'm toxic, so I know what toxic people are like.

189
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,180
And...

190
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:34,900
I'm scared.

191
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,120
Wait.

192
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,030
I never...

193
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,500
Eh.

194
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,380
You're so far from me!

195
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,000
Alright, warm up.

196
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,000
Done.

197
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,320
Warm up.

198
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,300
Done.

199
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,860
Let's go!

200
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,800
Yay!

201
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:28,600
now we cute now i'm satisfied i've let my anger out i've let
my anger look they accepted it it's like is it truly is it

202
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:42,040
truly bad if like they signed the consent form by clicking
yes to the duel that's that's on them now i'm blaming the

203
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:56,000
victim like how that guy set out was playing victim yeah
they they had the choice to say no but they consented to

204
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:05,140
getting their ass beat no no no that was the guy that sent
an invite to me first and then I was like no I picked my own

205
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:11,560
I picked my targets and then I looked at like that real fast
and I was like oh okay you want you want it your ass beat

206
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,320
okay Okay, that, yeah, sure.

207
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,740
Yeah, he sent the dual invite first.

208
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,100
I said no, because I was at, excuse me, I do it.

209
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,140
I send the invites, not you.

210
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,420
And now, and then I was like, I looked them up, and I was
like, you know what, share.

211
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,940
You wanted to fight me?

212
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,100
Sure, let's do this.

213
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,880
And by the way, I went support, guys.

214
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:57,100
I didn't pick DPS I picked one of the most broken roles in
this game I picked a role that allows me to have self-heal

215
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:11,140
compared to any other character but hey hey they said they
said they said supports can't carry And what was that?

216
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,420
I love picking Loki during these duels because it's like,
it's like they have, it's like a little, it's like hide and

217
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,680
seek being like, oh, which one's the real Doki?

218
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,540
Whoa!

219
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,240
I'll never tell.

220
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,120
And it always works.

221
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,300
99% of the time, it somehow always works.

222
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,740
I heard there was a tournament going on right now.

223
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,220
I heard like the J3 community clash, right?

224
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:54,300
Oh my god, it's, I think it's so funny because like, um,
people who couldn't, who didn't like, uh, who didn't like

225
00:23:54,300 --> 00:24:04,880
make it to the, uh, didn't make it in qualifiers, got like a
second chance in the people, like, because J3 invited like

226
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:16,480
three captains who basically get in automatically without
having to um without having to like uh go through open

227
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:23,620
qualifiers so so basically those confirmed teams they just
waited for all the good teams that got knocked out and then

228
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:34,240
poached those players for the qualified section i was like
that's so smart because there's lots of really good players

229
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:42,620
that didn't qualify that got like eliminated and they just
waited until because like they basically got like a second

230
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:50,820
chance because like snake case who was in our j3 team got
picked up by bogey well they got eliminated though they got

231
00:24:50,820 --> 00:25:00,760
knocked out but i was like that's so fucking smart you know
they did they still got eliminated by the way but they got

232
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:11,780
to have like he got a second life that's a jokie play right
there They literally waited Since they already have like a

233
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:20,660
spot Like an open spot on Mac Oh my god Gambit's open Okay
Okay I don't need to play Gambit at least I mean I do want

234
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:28,840

the for like um for the three captains that got in

237
00:25:52,760 --> 00:26:05,420

I gotta save my time.

247
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,230
No cards!

248
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,510

249
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,050
No cards!

250
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,790
Oh my god, this is full of dev.

251
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:28,430
What?

252
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,270
Oh my god!

253
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,070
Okay, wait.

254
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:37,070
Oh yeah, no, he was not aiming for me.

255
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,130
That...

256
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,270
He was 100% not aiming for me.

257
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,030
I don't believe it.

258
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,070
Oh, man.

259
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,530
Talk about the cabs, you know?

260
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,400
It sucks because we don't really have a shield.

261
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,320
So I have to, like, have to be very careful.

262
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,780
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,000
Alright.

264
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:22,520
I'll talk a little bit here, so if we catch some people
being really sexist, I get to clip that.

265
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,280
Wow, that's not cool.

266
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,720
Wow, please, I need kills.

267
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,980
Wait, where did my infest go?

268
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,680
Where is she?

269
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,860
Dude, there's no way we lose this.

270
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,480
I didn't realize both of us were sad.

271
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,460
Like, where did my, where did my Invis go?

272
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,020
It's crazy work, not gonna lie.

273
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,710
I didn't have another dash, which sucks.

274
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,730
I dashed up, and then they still followed me.

275
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,390
I'm gonna use that to heal myself real quick.

276
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:12,950
Alright, that's fine.

277
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,270
It's no longer fine.

278
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,090
What the?

279
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:31,730
fuck did you guys see that i i heard nothing i didn't hear
it like okay um i cleansed us i cleansed us wow

280
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:41,590

mechanically we have to have a few players that are just

281
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:51,290
playing like the worst game of their life for this to be
possible holy fuck i don't know who it is I told you,

282
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,910
weekend queues is fucking crazy.

283
00:29:53,370 --> 00:30:00,870
Nobody, everybody is like, everybody is like so unhinged
right now.

284
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:04,730
The thing is, this has been like my, all my games today.

285
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,030
Surprisingly.

286
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:16,150
I don't know, we do have a magic that maybe, I don't know.

287
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,190
We also are other DPS too, to be fair.

288
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,050
We're walking.

289
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:22,650
Or the Angela back one.

290
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,370
We have like...

291
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:29,150
We have a magic, but their Hawkeye is so free for some
reason.

292
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,860
Please, I just need you to heal me.

293
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,880
Please just heal me as well!

294
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,160
Oh my god!

295
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:43,980
Wow.

296
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,480
She wasn't healing me!

297
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,320
Oh my god!

298
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,580
Oh my gosh, a TP.

299
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,260
I don't...

300
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,260
Okay, someone else got it.

301
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,180
Oh.

302
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,640
That support is not a bro right now.

303
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,620
That support.

304
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,560
Actually, it's actually gameplay.

305
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,280
Let's go, Dean.

306
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,560
You'll need a top-notch team.

307
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,860
Oh my god.

308
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,000
I was like, okay, I'm getting gonna get healed, right?

309
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,760
Yes

310
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:34,040
I don't know if she got blinded she got blinded by daredevil
But like every time I ult it I can't be aggressive with the

311
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:43,260
ult I can't be fucking aggressive with it

312
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,640
Like I literally I'm trying to play with my other support
too

313
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:00,260
Gambit if you don't play gambit just swap off of them play
your main What the fuck?

314
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,580
I'm...

315
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,060
I...

316
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,100
I ult...

Whoa, I'm using my movement.

337
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,020

339
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,740
All that amazing.

00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,030
Score, 0, 2, 1.

341
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,620
Well, you can't expect to win them all.

342
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,240
Oh, my God!

343
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,300
Player made?

344
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,620
Oh, wow!

345
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,720
Oh, wow.

346
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,040
Have you won tournaments with Gambit?

347
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,320

348
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,780
Well, the other guy's half, bro.

351
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,420
Is that crazy?

352
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,980
Is that fucking crazy?

353
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,920
The games during the weekend?

354
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,500
People that, this is what I'm saying.

355
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,700
This is what I'm saying.

356
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:07,800
these times it's like like during this day it's fucking
crazy they're like why just use movement and i'm like oh i

359
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:38,020

like so it's because it's the usual i mean i don't care

360
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:48,920
about my elo i literally play this game like i play this
game for the vibes but i try like i still try i'm not like

361
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
desperate for

362
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,100
Happens.

363
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:54,540
Happens.

364
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:58,640
Yeah.

365
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,120
Not the vibes.

366
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,840
I hate that they ruin vibes.

367
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,740
I literally just play just because it's rank and it's fun
for me.

368
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,840
But like, I stream whenever at, like, if it's, like, moments
where, like, people are being extremely sexist or toxic,

369
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,020
like, I stream.

370
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,220
Because if I'm going to get beat, if I'm going to get
roasted, like, I'm not going to roast it for free.

371
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,540
I might as well make it content.

372
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:30,780
word is gone now i always say i like to play for the vibes
because i do have fun competitively and like like i like to

373
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:39,560
play rank as a like as my off time because i do enjoy it
like i don't care about my rank what my rank is i just like

374
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:50,900
playing the game like i try like if i get points yay if i
lose points oh no yeah like if i lose points oh well gg go

375
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,920
next but Like, I already got top 500.

376
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,100
I already hit my goal.

377
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,740
Like, I got top 500.

378
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,560
I hit my goal already.

379
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:11,160
So, like, for me, for me, like, I don't need another top
500.

380
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,680
I'm just playing.

381
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,100
If I get it, that's cool.

382
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,040
If I don't get it, oh, well.

383
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,360
I already have a top 500 badge.

384
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,170
Yeah, and then, like, it's like...

385
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:36,650
Um, also, that's very brave for the TTVer to fucking talk
shit.

386
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:43,110
Like, it's very brave of them.

387
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:47,890
Like,

388
00:37:51,110 --> 00:38:00,070
if you're, I guess if you're like, yeah, unless that's your
whole streamer personality and the fact that they have a TTV

389
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:00,470
name.

390
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:12,750
I don't put my entire self-worth on.

391
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,570
I do.

392
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:17,410
I do when the game first comes out, because I would get
depressed when...

393
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:20,910
I do when the game first comes out, but not like...

394
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,710
I can't challenge people in ring.

395
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,510
Like, what's the point?

396
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,610
I thought, like, duels...

397
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:28,630
I feel like duels, you should be able to do it when
you're...

398
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:35,210
For duels, you should be able to challenge someone when
you're in queue because to pass the time.

399
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,030
because it's like death match.

400
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:40,290
It's the perfect time, place to pass the time.

401
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,550
Now I guess I'll just go to the club.

402
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,670
I guess I'll just go to the club.

403
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,930
I'll go dance and hang out.

404
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,530
Where are they?

405
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,870
Wait, where's the club?

406
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:10,010
If someone leaves your match, then they get...

407
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,510
It's annoying.

408
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,770
Yeah, but I'll take it.

409
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,870
Oh my god, no one likes to go to the club no more.

410
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,590
No!

411
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,970
Where did everyone go?

412
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,870
Terrorizing the elop.

413
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,030
Terrorizing rank right now.

414
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:32,850
Like me.

415
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,030
Just like me.

416
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,300
Dancing is old school.

417
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,640
You gotta keep up with the time.

418
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,580
No!

419
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,580
No one dances no more!

420
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:05,360
What do I do when no one wants to dance?

421
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,000
This is why Rivals is dying.

422
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,800
There's no more whimsy.

423
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,480
I'll play Cloakless.

424
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,240
I don't know.

425
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,260
But they have a mag.

426
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,400
Rivals is dying because no, there's no more whimsy anymore.

427
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,480
Only...

428
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,640
I think the non, the back-to-back.

429
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:40,110
rival's drama isn't helping out the whimsy is dying and all
we have left is trauma

430
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:58,280
no the back to back to back um the j3 apparently there was a
apparently a hacker team allegedly hacker team made it

431
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:06,640
through are still playing in the tournament um and then a
big google dokey was dropped about this alleged hacker

432
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:17,860
because apparently um um he's friends and his mods his
friends and his like mods are all hackers so like people

433
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:29,020
were like well that's pretty sus already if his friends and
his mods hacked in rivals um and he got called out as a

434
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:38,360
hacker so it's like but then people um but then they're like
we checked his pc so but he had he got chance to restart his

435
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:48,460
pc before they checked his pc so it's like there's no way to
actually catch him but it's very suspicious and the team

436
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:59,540
that had the hacking team the team that had the hacking team
knocked out several teams that could have made it to the

437
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:12,340
finals so it's just very suspicious and like obviously net
ease doesn't want to be like very like 100% yeah he's a

438
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:18,440
hacker because they're worried that you know what if they
ban an innocent guy They want to be 100% sure if he's

439
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,020
hacking or not.

440
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,900
But the cheats that he could have is very hard to catch.

441
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,000
So, like, you can't 100% confirm if it's a hack.

442
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,460
And since NetEase is a very big company, they don't want to
be like, yeah, he's hacking because then, like, it would,

443
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,660
you know, affect their reputation if they're wrong.

444
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,720
So they only confirm stuff if it's, like, 100%.

445
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,400
Whoops.

446
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,320
Yeah.

447
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,680
So it's like...

448
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,860
I'll drop down.

449
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,220
Well, I'll keep somewhere.

450
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,380
Don't worry.

451
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,200
He was scared.

452
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,340
I'm gonna keep my thing.

453
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,040
Oh my god, I wanted to keep it for it.

454
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,300
Now if we get dope, we're a little fuck.

455
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,880
It's a little fucky-wucky and we get... Oh!

456
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,920
Oh, that's very unlucky.

457
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,640
Holy shit.

458
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,680
Yeah, this sucks.

459
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,160
I was gonna say we get dope.

460
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,460
It's gonna be really bad for us.

461
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,520
Oh, my God.

462
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,320
I want to get out of here.

463
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,700
Let me out of this ride.

464
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:28,800
Let me out of here.

465
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:30,500
Okay.

466
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,400
Oh, my God.

467
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,300
Thank God the mag doesn't have all.

468
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,660
Yeah, I took a gamble.

469
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:36,900
I took a gamble.

470
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:41,120
I'll be like, I hope the mag doesn't have all.

471
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,140
That will be very awkward.

472
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,000
Please copy me.

473
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,180
Oh, God.

474
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,420
Good luck, good luck, Loki!

475
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,200
Good luck!

476
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,360
Alright.

477
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:58,520
Nice.

478
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,440
I took the gambit, exactly.

479
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:05,740
There we go.

480
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,760
He misses.

481
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,100
I instantly played away.

482
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,400
I was just like, not me.

483
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,240
Even though it should be me.

484
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,240
Not me.

485
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,800
This is not me.

486
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,100
Oh, shit.

487
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,980
Good luck to all of us.

That's good.

493
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,160
Oh, my God.

494
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,540

495
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:47,940
Oh, wait.

496
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:48,960

497
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,900
Oh, no.

498
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,260

Alright, I still have low key.

506
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,220
Or still venom.

507
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:45,920
Well, um, I hope my two DPS lives.

508
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,820
Or like, oh, wait, no, it's just Emma.

509
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,060
It's Emma.

510
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,720
Emma will be fine.

511
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,700
I believe in the Emma.

512
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,140
Oh, wait.

513
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,040
Alright, I'm gonna keep my thing when the venom goes high.

514
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,760
I should swap, though.

515
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,920
I should just swap to Invis.

516
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,460
Because I think I think I...

517
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,300
Don't worry!

518
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,360
I got this!

519
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,080
Okay, you didn't need to use that.

520
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,580
That felt like a waste, but that's okay.

521
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,000
I think I'm on it?

522
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:22,580

I was literally one.

583
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,210
Oh my god!

584
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,010
He missed.

00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:09,370
Holy shit.

586
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:13,330

00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,890
Everyone is so mad.

591
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:50,570
Why is everyone so mad?

592
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:53,490
There's...

593
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:56,390
Literally, 3 out of 3.

594
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:59,070
Someone is mad at someone.

595
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:03,150
But at least this time, it's not me.

596
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,610

597
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:07,670

I didn't get blamed this time.

599
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:13,730
Yeah, oh boy, I can't wait to relax and play Mara Ramos.

600
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:17,830
He was going to play on the most toxic games ever.

601
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:19,610
At least it wasn't me.

602
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:23,650
I am teaching all of you guys to don't play on the weekend.

603
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:27,050
It's a special breed of players as this day.

604
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:34,190
I normally don't, but today, because I usually have a
different stream on Saturday, so I'm too tired to play on

605
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:35,350
Saturday or Sunday.

606
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,470
You know what?

607
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:39,250
Saturday is my free day.

608
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:41,370
Let me play some rivals.

609
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:47,150
And I forgot what it was like back then.

610
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,190
I really did.

611
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:54,930
I usually never play at this day.

612
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:58,670
I do it for you guys.

613
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:00,150
I'm showing you guys.

614
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:05,150

I know we all know you, though.

620
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:21,490
Today was the first time I've ever bumped into Kingsman in
ring because I'd never play at this day.

621
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:24,990
Alright, kill our cloak, not me, though.

622
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,850
Oh, fuck, I didn't mean that.

623
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:30,490
Oh, shit.

624
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:31,790
That was just a joke.

625
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:34,870
I didn't think he'd actually do it.

626
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:39,470
I didn't think he'd actually kill him.

627
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:41,910
Oh, man.

628
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:45,050
I guess it sucks to be our Loki right now.

629
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:46,770
Oh, I should help him.

630
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:47,870
Hello.

631
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:50,570
He really went.

632
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:51,510
Okay, sure.

633
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:57,910
I mean, yeah, just add me.

634
00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:59,770
It's just Jokey bird.

635
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:01,470
I don't want to use it.

636
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:02,830
I kited.

637
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:04,810
Poor hell up.

638
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:06,530
Hoping for your Phoenix.

639
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:08,910
Our poor Hella.

640
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:16,950
Where is he?

641
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:18,190
Is he gonna?

642
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:20,170
Oh, I thought he was gonna do it.

643
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,190
He's just gonna chill.

644
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:24,390
Okay, I don't think he hit anybody.

645
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:27,210
Like I literally think he missed.

646
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:28,810
All right, here we go.

647
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:30,190
Round two!

648
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:31,270
It's okay.

649
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:34,350
He already used the rock on the other on my Glocki.

650
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:35,930
Yeah.

651
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:39,750

There we go.

653
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:42,250
What the fuck?

654
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:43,390

I don't think we're winning this, but like, you know, it
looked cool.

660
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:58,150
He missed.

Nice.

678
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,480

00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:04,920
Oh.

680
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,160

681
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,220

682
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,280
Oh my god.

683
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,220
I thought...

684
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:19,400
I thought... You know, I I thought he would not shoot me,
but he did.

685
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,140
It's alright.

686
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:20,840
It's cool.

687
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,080
Oh, I should have stayed home.

688
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,500
I didn't believe in my team.

689
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,780
He literally shot me in the...

690
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:31,320
I literally had like 20 bodyguards surrounding me.

691
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,300
And then I still got shot.

692
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,320
Like, that's crazy.

693
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,040
I swear, I was in the center of all that, too.

694
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,520
But I still got shot.

695
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,220
All right, here we go.

696
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,080
Boop, boop, boop.

697
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:53,510
All right.

698
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:54,850
Do they need me?

699
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:57,390
I think they don't need me.

700
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:59,270
Watch this.

701
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:01,410
All right.

702
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:03,370
You thought you're always sick?

703
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:06,090
That's right, because the mag doesn't have all the ice, so I
have to do this.

704
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:08,290
That's right.

705
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:11,010
That's sucking right.

706
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:14,510
You're a low-key old last shorter.

707
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:22,050
For those who don't know, if a low-key copy's cloaked, her
all is shorter than uh a regular cloak call because of the

708
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:32,230
timer it doesn't extend the copy for some fucking reason i
don't know why it's looking weird yeah it it disappears

709
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:41,170

why oh no don't worry loki i got you copy me i'm right here

All right, let's blind you.

713
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:54,350
I got a little scared there.

714
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:57,030
All right.

715
00:59:58,390 --> 00:59:59,370

01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:01,570
Yeah, she'll be fine.

717
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:04,490
There we go.

718
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:06,750
Could be a bug?

719
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:07,510
Who knows?

720
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,490
It works for me.

721
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:10,830
Please, please don't let him.

722
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:12,030
Don't let her do this again!

723
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,590
Don't let her do this again!

724
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:14,930
She's just standing there!

725
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:16,110
Yay!

726
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:25,790

front of all three of us.

01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:29,850
Yay!

01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:32,210
Absolutely winnable.

729
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:39,950
Yeah, that phoenix wanted to fuck me up.

730
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:42,730
Yay!

731
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:46,750

01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:30,870
He needs it bad.

771
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:34,790
Bro, when you need it bad, I'm lower ranked than you.

772
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:35,910
I didn't say anything.

773
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:36,770
That's not what I said.

774
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:38,530
I'm repeating what they said.

775
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:44,350
I'm just saying like, bro, this is what you're doing with me

Wait, I need to ask my chat.

779
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:55,270

Listen, listen, listen.

Just seven more games.

831
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,960
We're ready to go on an adventure.

832
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,240

I thought he would...

1058
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:05,990
I was like, guys, he has broken, he has Punisher on.

1059

01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:31,830

I can TP if he's tall.

1069
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:46,830
211.

1070
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:49,290
Don't miss it.

1071
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:51,430
Oh my god.

1072
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:53,830
What?

1073
01:21:57,810 --> 01:21:59,390
I should have went around.

1074
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:00,910
I panicked.

1075
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:03,310
I forgot there's another hole.

1076
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:06,210
I might have panicked there.

1077
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:08,130
I could have went across.

1078
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,990
I did not expect that.

1079
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:19,130
I could have went around, but like, you know, when you get
kidnapped, you know, you don't really think about there's

1080
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:19,930
another hole.

1081
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:28,050
Like, you know, you don't expect to get abducted.

1082
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:32,070
That is very smart, though.

1083
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,510
It's, people usually do that.

1084
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:34,310
It cut off yours.

1085
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:41,810

1088
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:10,710
There is an alt behind you

1089
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:18,250

1091
01:23:40,370 --> 01:23:48,390
because it's like Invis, Invis, we're Punisher and then my
rocket looks at me and was like you're gonna save me, right?

1092
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:50,510
And I'm just like, is that a Punisher?

1093
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:54,930
They're fine.

1094
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:57,250
You're so healthy.

1095
01:23:59,350 --> 01:23:59,910
I'm on, I'm on.

1096
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:01,110
You're walking.

1097
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:01,830
Save me a big wall.

1098
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:04,310

1099
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:05,490

01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:09,550
Pulling it back.

Oh my god, he jumped!

1103
01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:11,490
Good run, good run.

1104
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:15,830
Okay, when they jump, they give you a bigger pull, which is
the best part.

1105
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:19,430
You gotta pull them when they're jumping.

1106
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:24,490
That's brutal again.

1107
01:24:30,610 --> 01:24:32,330
It's like why, like, when people...

1108
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:34,330
Okay, I got...

1261
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:22,680
the fact that got spider-man grabbed into the mad god is
insane i've never had that happen before that was the

1262
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:33,020

needs four games to one above all maybe we'll just be stuck

1264
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:59,280
on four games honestly respect that's the most big brain
i've ever seen you don't want me to you here i could go back

1265
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:07,620
here it does not look like an accident he grabbed me the
moment he slammed down i need you to know that your mic's

1266
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:13,140
not working brother no you're my Grab me the moment the mag
did his slam.

1267
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:17,940
Literally, I was ready to press the swap button.

1268
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:22,360
And I, and it like, and then, and then I got the grab.

1269
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:27,140
Alright, move forward.

1270
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:31,240
Oh my god.

1271
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:31,740
I bubble, I bubble.

1272
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:38,840
Jesus Christ.

1273
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:39,900
I can die behind me.

1274
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:40,820

1275
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:42,700

1277
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:51,960
Oh my god, we didn't have another bubble.

1278
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:55,700
She just got that bubble too.

1279
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,500
I think it's just a team diff.

1280
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:05,580
We don't have anyone that actually counters the spotty.

1281
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:07,320
Like we don't have a Bucky player, I think.

1282
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:08,640
I don't know.

1283
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:24,400
I think it's just Or maybe a triple supporters up there
Usually you play triple support against Spider-Man Because

1284
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,700
then he's like worthless in game

1285
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:47,060

didn't wait should I think I personally I think personally

1286
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:57,060

actually he makes him worthless like that one out of there

Cons.

1352
01:45:58,690 --> 01:45:58,970
See?

1353
01:45:59,410 --> 01:46:00,490
That's calming.

1354
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:03,670
That's, I'm literally calming.

1355
01:46:10,670 --> 01:46:13,330
I think he saw my tournament like yesterday.

1356
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:15,750
He's like, why is this she like this in rank?

1357
01:46:16,910 --> 01:46:18,890
I fucking booger bash.

1358
01:46:19,050 --> 01:46:20,370
I'm like, I need help.

1359
01:46:20,470 --> 01:46:21,610
Edgy, edgy, edgy.

1360
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:22,770
Moxie, help me.

1361
01:46:22,970 --> 01:46:23,970
Maxip getting dumb.

1362
01:46:25,590 --> 01:46:26,250
He's like, who else?

1363
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:27,850
He's like, that's crazy.

1364
01:46:28,010 --> 01:46:29,030
Why is she like this in rain?

1365
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:37,980
Like, like when Crook beats up my friend.

1366
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:38,500
No, no, no.

1367
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:39,040
I don't need it.

1368
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:39,600
I don't need it.

1369
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:40,980
I don't need it.

1370
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:41,280
No.

1371
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:51,260
Like, why isn't she like this in rank?

1372
01:46:53,060 --> 01:46:54,040
That's true.

1373
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,280
Why isn't she?

1374
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:59,700
Rank is the vibe, so.

1375
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:04,220
Alright.

1376
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:05,440
What are we doing?

1377
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:09,800
Or when I go...

1378
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:11,260
Yeah, I'm like a different person.

1379
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:11,720
here.

1380
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:14,620
I rock it.

1381
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:16,460
Oh yeah, no, I should rock it.

1382
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:21,500
This person literally has Lord, like, Lord++ on cloak.

1383
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:37,720
I mean, if I really want to win, I go low key and then get
double cloak up, because that shit is cancer.

1384
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:42,780
That shit sucks.

1385
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:51,300
I'll give people a jump pack Nah, the J3 tournament I don't
even know if it's still going on

1386
01:47:57,160 --> 01:48:02,540
Apparently you're supposed to be four invited captains But
then it became three I don't even know how that happened

1387
01:48:02,540 --> 01:48:15,160

1396
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:38,020

01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:44,700
Oh my god, no.

1402
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:45,640
It's dive.

1403
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:47,060
It really is.

1404
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:48,560
It really is.

1405
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:53,240
Oh my god.

1406
01:48:53,540 --> 01:48:55,340
Okay, I didn't mean I want practice now.

1407
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:58,720
I really did not mean that the tournament is over.

1408
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,520
The tournament is over.

1409
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,940
The tournament is over.

1410
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:06,740
The tournament is over.

1411
01:49:08,180 --> 01:49:10,040
You were trained.

1412
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:11,060
Where is this?

1413
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:14,860
I said I didn't mean I want it now.

1414
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:21,780
The grind never stopped.

1415
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:22,180
Oh, no.

1416
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:23,980
You're welcome.

1417
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:27,180
Digimode, I'm gonna need you to lock in, Vucker.

1418
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:29,040

1423
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:37,680
There's not no new mic.

1424
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:39,260
A new mic's not gonna get changed.

1425
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:40,100

Yay.

1438
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,360
This is how I carry things.

1439
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:02,140
Alright, me first.

1440
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:05,520

See?

1479
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:57,120
That's all I have to say.

1480
01:51:57,660 --> 01:51:59,880
Me, first thing, though.

1481
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:03,060
The 1% the dirty.

1482
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:04,500
You're winning now.

1483
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:06,180
No, I think...

1484
01:52:06,180 --> 01:52:06,440
No, no.

1485
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:07,020
That's not it.

1486
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:08,640
I would have won regardless.

1487
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:11,460
I...

1488
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:16,760
I have won without having to do the 1% job.

1489
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:18,080
Nah.

1490
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:22,180
I don't think so.

1491
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,780
Oh, only real players have zero deaths.

1492
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:30,260
Alright, nice.

What do you mean?

1527
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:13,980
Yeah, but I don't remember if he's the jet player that
everyone hates or the jet player that everyone is scared of.

1528
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:18,140
There's too many jet players.

1529
01:54:19,540 --> 01:54:20,540
I don't remember.

1530
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:35,100
30 seconds before you attack Get ready The reality of Jeff
Could be I don't know he's playing Thor So I know He is

1531
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:45,540

witch and jeff player and no one knew who he is who he was

1533
01:54:55,780 --> 01:55:03,300
because he was on an alt account he literally was on like
pro lob like the oh my god he's not scared the pro lobbies

1534
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:08,540
just throwing scarlet witch out and having like a positive
win rate

1535
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:23,180
mother backline in five so the bad part is that Okay, I
wouldn't like if somebody shot the squid.

1536
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:27,080
It's okay, we have Rose.

1537
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:30,540
No, I'm stalling these guys, aren't...

1538
01:55:30,540 --> 01:55:31,000
Alright.

1539
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:34,260
But what?

1540
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:34,800
The orbs!

1541
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:36,800
I think she's got the orbs.

1542
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:40,240
Look at that, look at that, uh...

1543
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:40,580
Rocket, rocket.

1544
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:41,920
Oh, I should have thrown my orbs.

1545
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:42,760
Don't worry.

1546
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:44,760
Don't worry, I didn't.

1547
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:48,280
He doesn't know I was trying to DPS instead of healing him.

1548
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:50,220
But he doesn't.

1549
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:53,620
Oh my god, what he doesn't know won't hurt him.

1550
01:55:54,340 --> 01:55:56,780
That's a fast name reel, I will have to say.

1551
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:57,880
You cannot tell me.

1552
01:55:58,520 --> 01:55:59,220
This is not late.

1553
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:00,620
Almost ready.

1554
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:01,500
Very low, Elo.

1555
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:06,740
Whoa!

1556
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:08,400
Oh my god!

1557
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:10,380
I'm okay.

1558
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:11,640
I'm okay.

1559
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,920
I didn't say anything because I knew I would lift.

1560
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:17,080
I knew I was gonna lift.

1561
01:56:18,380 --> 01:56:19,160
They weren't at his time.

1562
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:20,080
Oh.

1563
01:56:20,220 --> 01:56:21,360
No, not there.

1564
01:56:21,620 --> 01:56:24,200
I think I made this kind of mad.

1565
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:27,240
This is real firepower.

1566
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:28,240
Get the rocket.

1567
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:29,920
All right, let's go.

1568
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:30,860
Fuck these guys.

1569
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:31,940
I swear.

1570
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:35,160
Isn't this rocket a streamer?

1571
01:56:36,620 --> 01:56:38,240
I don't think so.

1572
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:41,140
All right.

1573
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:42,200
We're five.

1574
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:44,320
We're so safe.

1575
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:46,680
Like nothing to worry about.

1576
01:56:47,740 --> 01:56:47,920
Oh.

1577
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:54,220
Alright, there's no way they'll see this.

1578
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:58,360
Alright, thank God I threw the old...

1579
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:02,680
There's no way they see me here, right?

1580
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:03,700
Whoa!

1581
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:08,160
I'm fine.

1582
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:10,420
Oh shit!

1583
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:11,560
Oh shit!

1584
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:13,720
I got greedy!

1585
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:15,780
I got greedy!

1586
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:18,180
I got so greedy!

1587
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:22,120
I wanted to chop that tree down.

1588
01:57:23,860 --> 01:57:24,960
So yeah, I have a plan.

1589
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:25,520
They're down too.

1590
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:27,140
They have no supports, actually.

1591
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:30,940
Why would anyone want to border when they can enjoy chaos?

1592
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:31,560
There we go.

1593
01:57:33,140 --> 01:57:34,100
I'm going away.

1594
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:34,460
I'm going away.

1595
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:35,460
I'm going away.

1596
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:35,840
All right.

1597
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:37,580
And then I swap.

1598
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:38,140
Watch this.

1599
01:57:38,180 --> 01:57:39,560
He's literally like breathing on one foot.

1600
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:40,860
This guy's so low.

1601
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:45,600
He doesn't know I'm here.

1602
01:57:46,220 --> 01:57:47,280
He doesn't know I'm here.

1603
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:47,820
He doesn't know I'm here.

1604
01:57:48,180 --> 01:57:50,380
He doesn't know I'm here now.

1605
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:51,620
That's spotty man.

1606
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:54,370
That spotty man can't...

1607
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:55,520
Doesn't know.

1608
01:57:58,040 --> 01:57:59,760
That spotty man doesn't know.

1609
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:02,360
I'm so safe.

1610
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:06,740
Get him here, get him here, get him here.

1611
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:06,980
I'm ready.

1612
01:58:08,060 --> 01:58:09,020
It's so safe.

1613
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:11,520
Oh shit!

1614
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:13,800
Wait, where's my...

1615
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:14,080
Okay.

1616
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:15,920
Let's hope the...

1617
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:17,820
Oh, that's... that's awkward.

1618
01:58:18,180 --> 01:58:19,940
You think my heels getting to them?

1619
01:58:20,020 --> 01:58:20,460
It is.

1620
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:21,700
All right.

1621
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:23,160
It is.

1622
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:25,640
All right.

1623
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:26,860
I'm letting my cloak build.

1624
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:29,500
Oh, not technically not throwing.

1625
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:30,420
Don't worry.

1626
01:58:30,820 --> 01:58:31,520
Classic ricochet.

1627
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:32,100
Watch this.

1628
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:33,160
It hits them perfectly.

1629
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:35,080
Oh, look at that.

1630
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:36,580
Oh my God.

1631
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:39,000
That's actually so fucking, you know what?

1632
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:39,740
Let's go.

1633
01:58:43,580 --> 01:58:44,620
Okay, nice.

1634
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:47,080
Let's go.

1635
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:47,340
Let's go.

1636
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:48,080
Let's go.

1637
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:48,160
Let's go.

1638
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:50,160
My little...

1639
01:58:50,700 --> 01:58:53,020
Oh, I should have fucking threw that res for him.

1640
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:54,220
Are we throwing?

1641
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:55,040
No.

1642
01:58:56,220 --> 01:58:57,360
No way.

1643
01:58:58,040 --> 01:58:59,180
No way.

1644
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:01,960
See, he still doesn't know.

1645
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:08,400
See, I totally do.

1646
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:08,840
No!

1647
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:11,400
No!

1648
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:13,720
No!

1649
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:14,580
No!

1650
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:22,920
He found me!

1651
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:25,840
Oh!

1652
01:59:28,180 --> 01:59:30,120
All right All right, it's okay.

1653
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:32,420
Yeah, it was a one beat.

1654
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:42,780
Okay, it's not okay I got shoved in the locker That's okay
Unfortunately guys, unfortunately All right, it's okay more

1655
01:59:42,780 --> 01:59:43,920
XP you get more.

1656
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:44,740
God.

1657
01:59:44,900 --> 01:59:45,160
Oh God.

1658
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:46,840
He's back It's okay.

1659
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:48,140
I I got you.

1660
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:49,160
I got you

1661
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:57,460
I helped in that just remember No, they're not in a group.

1662
01:59:57,680 --> 01:59:57,880
Never mind.

1663
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:04,520
No bother Once I walk out of spawn, though, I'm so scared to
get out of the shadows.

1664
02:00:05,100 --> 02:00:07,000
You won't know I'm in this here, right?

1665
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:09,920
Surely he wouldn't know.

1666
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:11,020
Surely.

1667
02:00:12,660 --> 02:00:14,680
Surely he doesn't know I'm in here.

1668
02:00:15,220 --> 02:00:16,300
Oh, he got this.

1669
02:00:21,540 --> 02:00:23,260
He doesn't know I'm right here.

1670
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:24,000
Literally Thanos.

1671
02:00:25,140 --> 02:00:25,340
Holy shit.

1672
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:26,020
All right.

1673
02:00:26,660 --> 02:00:27,200
All right.

1674
02:00:27,860 --> 02:00:28,600
Here we go.

1675
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:29,340
There we go.

1676
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:29,820
We're good.

1677
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:30,080
We're good.

1678
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:30,420
We're good.

1679
02:00:31,340 --> 02:00:32,580
I'm just in the shadows.

1680
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:33,060
He doesn't.

1681
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:34,360
See, he doesn't know I'm right here.

1682
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:36,380
Are they going to play Mag or is that like...

1683
02:00:36,380 --> 02:00:37,360
He doesn't know I'm right here.

1684
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:38,040
You're just not allowed to play Mag.

1685
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:38,380
That's okay.

1686
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:38,920
That's okay.

1687
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:40,140
He didn't grab me.

1688
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:43,440
As long as the Spider-Man didn't grab me, we're fine.

1689
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:45,140
See, right here.

1690
02:00:45,420 --> 02:00:46,220
We're so safe.

1691
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:48,780
I hope that whale's not here.

1692
02:00:48,860 --> 02:00:49,720
I really do.

1693
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:51,040
Oh, no.

1694
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:53,200
Oh, my God.

1695
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:54,680
We got this.

1696
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:54,960
We got...

1697
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:55,680
See, we're still alive.

1698
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:59,100

Oh, that's awkward.

1704
02:01:34,780 --> 02:01:35,840
That's pretty awkward.

1705
02:01:36,220 --> 02:01:37,200
Oh, fuck.

1706
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:39,460

1707
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:41,400
No, he lost me.

1708
02:01:41,620 --> 02:01:42,780
No, he didn't lose me.

1709
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:50,460
I was like, I did it.

1710
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:54,980

1711
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:56,460
Yeah, you're kind of dead.

1712

Play for our girdle.

1716
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:38,720
Like, if we lose this, we come back with TP and girdle.

1717
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:39,100
Okay.

1718
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:40,400

Can you TP, uh, cloak?

1720
02:02:42,460 --> 02:02:44,120
Even if it's so much support, we only need one ult.

1721
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:46,800
Just TP.

1722
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:48,300

It's okay.

1728
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:54,240
We're fine.

1729
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:54,920
We're so healthy.

1730
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:56,180
We're so healthy.

1731
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:57,240
I jumped through.

1732
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:57,480
I jumped through.

1733
02:02:57,540 --> 02:02:57,900
I touched, I touched.

1734
02:02:58,340 --> 02:02:58,900

Oh my god.

1738
02:03:05,540 --> 02:03:06,720

That's what he gets.

1757
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:11,040
He won the battle but lost the war.

1758
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:13,280
I was just the bait.

1759
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:18,360
That was the fucking bait.

1760
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:22,700

I don't even remember what else I said in that game.

1774
02:05:58,230 --> 02:06:00,910

1813
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:33,080

How?

1829
02:09:30,260 --> 02:09:33,180
We could have at least bet Loki.

1830
02:09:34,660 --> 02:09:35,580
Oh my god.

1831
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:36,560
It's gonna be Gambit.

1832
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:39,400
Oh my god.

1833
02:09:40,420 --> 02:09:42,220
How do we not even...

1834
02:09:42,240 --> 02:09:43,580
Bad Loki!

1835
02:09:44,580 --> 02:09:50,520
Like, it's fine, we don't- It's fine, we don't have fucking
Gambit, but Loki!

1836
02:09:53,420 --> 02:09:54,800
Wait, the soundtrack is fire!

1837
02:09:55,080 --> 02:09:56,040
Oh, shit.

02:09:56,820 --> 02:09:58,220
I fucking hate this map.

1839
02:09:58,540 --> 02:10:00,840
This is the second time I play this map, and I hate it.

1840
02:10:01,560 --> 02:10:02,360
This map sucks.

1841
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:09,540
How much time I got?

1842
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:10,040
8 seconds?

1843
02:10:10,200 --> 02:10:12,000
You got 5 seconds!

All right, here we go.

1845
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:18,320
All right, good to go.

1846
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:21,040
There's so much shit in the way, bro.

1847
02:10:21,660 --> 02:10:22,140
I hate it.

1848
02:10:22,220 --> 02:10:22,560
Oh, my God.

1849
02:10:22,660 --> 02:10:23,480
It's the school bus.

1850
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:26,500
It's my school bus.

1851
02:10:27,020 --> 02:10:27,500
Wait, it is.

1852
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:29,460
Fucking hate this, man.

1853
02:10:29,900 --> 02:10:30,760
Oh, my God.

1854
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:31,640
Oh, I need to...

1855
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:34,640
Oh, my God.

1856
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:35,360
They're exploring.

1857
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:36,840
He's exploring.

1858
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:38,260
He's like, oh, my God.

1859
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:39,920
This little explorer tab.

1860
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:40,280
Oh, my.

1861
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:40,880
We actually...

1862
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:41,820
That's good.

1863
02:10:45,420 --> 02:10:47,220
Why is this Loki doing here?

1864
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:48,060
Rick lamps, Rick lamps.

1865
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:48,660
What the fuck?

1866
02:10:48,980 --> 02:10:50,720
I was gonna say, how did this Loki get here?

1867
02:10:51,140 --> 02:10:52,680
How is this Loki still alive?

1868
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:54,140
What is Loki doing there?

1869
02:10:55,740 --> 02:10:56,540
That is sick.

1870
02:10:57,420 --> 02:10:58,840
We're only halfway?

1871
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:01,500
Um.

1872
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:03,840
Hold on.

1873
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:04,140
How do you live?

1874
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:04,600
Okay, for a second.

1875
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:06,860
Please.

1876
02:11:07,180 --> 02:11:07,680
How do you live?

1877
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:08,500
Oh!

1878
02:11:11,420 --> 02:11:12,900
Did I just pull both?

1879
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:13,640
All right.

1880
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:14,060
This should be fine.

1881
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:16,300
Wait, where's my gambit?

1882
02:11:23,530 --> 02:11:23,890
Alright.

1883
02:11:24,530 --> 02:11:27,950
I think we should uh, gambit all early and then we can combo
next.

1884
02:11:28,610 --> 02:11:29,330
So we all come back.

1885
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:30,130
Alright.

1886
02:11:31,210 --> 02:11:32,410
Uh, you first.

1887
02:11:33,790 --> 02:11:35,210
Yeah, can we copy and do it right now?

1888
02:11:35,390 --> 02:11:36,090
Oh wait, me?

1889
02:11:36,210 --> 02:11:36,570
Okay.

1890
02:11:36,690 --> 02:11:37,730
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1891
02:11:40,730 --> 02:11:41,990
I'm fucking getting it.

1892
02:11:42,010 --> 02:11:42,850
Okay, I shall copy.

1893
02:11:45,430 --> 02:11:45,790
Oh wait.

1894
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:47,150
Maps close range.

1895
02:11:47,190 --> 02:11:47,590
I'll watch.

1896
02:11:47,750 --> 02:11:48,010
I'll wait.

1897
02:11:49,070 --> 02:11:50,050
I'll look at the shield.

1898
02:11:50,370 --> 02:11:50,930
How can we do it now?

1899
02:11:51,130 --> 02:11:51,810
All right.

1900
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:53,150
Go, go, go.

1901
02:11:54,510 --> 02:11:55,250
I'm going to big spin.

1902
02:11:56,450 --> 02:11:57,110
Big spin, big spin.

1903
02:11:57,170 --> 02:11:58,890
I do not want to get near them.

1904
02:12:00,330 --> 02:12:00,850
After...

1905
02:12:00,850 --> 02:12:02,590
I don't know about you guys.

1906
02:12:02,690 --> 02:12:04,690
I'm so paranoid.

1907
02:12:05,370 --> 02:12:05,930
I'm so...

1908
02:12:07,790 --> 02:12:08,370
All right.

1909
02:12:09,510 --> 02:12:13,830
I'm so paranoid about fucking going aggressively.

1910
02:12:14,130 --> 02:12:15,910
After what happened to me...

1911
02:12:15,930 --> 02:12:18,830
I don't want to go in aggressively.

1912
02:12:20,190 --> 02:12:21,070
Oh, bye.

1913
02:12:22,070 --> 02:12:22,670
We give it?

1914
02:12:23,570 --> 02:12:24,550
Oh, they see like we don't need it.

1915
02:12:24,610 --> 02:12:25,010
We don't need it.

1916
02:12:25,410 --> 02:12:26,390
We got it.

1917
02:12:31,750 --> 02:12:35,510
All right, it's fine.

1918
02:12:35,650 --> 02:12:36,570
We made it.

1919
02:12:36,670 --> 02:12:38,510
We got a game of starter.

1920
02:12:38,670 --> 02:12:40,170
That was nothing for a god.

1921
02:12:40,170 --> 02:12:40,990
All right, here we go.

1922
02:12:43,570 --> 02:12:44,910
Oh, my God.

1923
02:12:53,410 --> 02:12:54,670
He's not looking at me, right?

1924
02:12:56,870 --> 02:12:58,030
All right, there's this.

1925
02:12:58,410 --> 02:12:58,710
Oh, wait.

1926
02:12:59,010 --> 02:12:59,670
This is where the...

1927
02:12:59,670 --> 02:13:01,790
Oh, is this where the car goes?

1928
02:13:03,930 --> 02:13:05,610
This is where the car goes.

1929
02:13:06,230 --> 02:13:10,610
Okay, I'm going to put one on here.

1930
02:13:11,790 --> 02:13:15,250
One on the other bus, and then I'll...

1931
02:13:15,250 --> 02:13:15,610
All right.

1932
02:13:16,670 --> 02:13:17,550
There we go.

1933
02:13:18,970 --> 02:13:20,930
They won't know which one's the real.

1934
02:13:21,930 --> 02:13:25,990
Look, he's doing it for the vibes!

1935
02:13:26,430 --> 02:13:28,030
Can we stop Metaslave in here?

1936
02:13:30,870 --> 02:13:33,110
But that Metaslave is all I'm about.

1937
02:13:33,330 --> 02:13:34,550
I'm all, I'm all.

1938
02:13:35,390 --> 02:13:39,530
Jesus Christ, that guy got deleted so fast.

1939
02:13:40,190 --> 02:13:40,930
I was...

1940
02:13:41,570 --> 02:13:42,790
Oh my god, okay.

1941
02:13:43,550 --> 02:13:44,850
I bet we got every final.

1942
02:13:46,770 --> 02:13:48,170
Wait, that guy's one.

1943
02:13:48,350 --> 02:13:49,170
Take out one of our supports.

1944
02:13:49,390 --> 02:13:49,610
Wait.

1945
02:13:50,050 --> 02:13:51,070
They don't need me.

1946
02:13:51,290 --> 02:13:51,730
Thank God.

1947
02:13:52,910 --> 02:13:53,590
That's great.

1948
02:13:55,890 --> 02:13:56,530
That's great.

1949
02:13:56,650 --> 02:13:57,550
They don't need me.

1950
02:13:58,190 --> 02:13:59,410
We got, we got that copy.

1951
02:13:59,530 --> 02:14:00,430
Why don't we copy early?

1952
02:14:00,850 --> 02:14:02,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1953
02:14:02,490 --> 02:14:02,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1954
02:14:02,830 --> 02:14:07,310
Red point is very tall and very big, so you gotta stand
inside of it.

1955
02:14:07,490 --> 02:14:07,790
All right.

1956
02:14:07,970 --> 02:14:08,650
I assume...

1957
02:14:08,650 --> 02:14:08,830
You're ready.

1958
02:14:08,970 --> 02:14:09,170
You're ready.

1959
02:14:09,350 --> 02:14:09,790
Once they walk.

1960
02:14:11,350 --> 02:14:13,130
I gotta leave.

1961
02:14:13,470 --> 02:14:13,870
I leave.

1962
02:14:14,250 --> 02:14:14,970

1963
02:14:16,550 --> 02:14:27,090

Did you see that?

I juke the sidewalk.

2018
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,500
I juke the sidewalk.

I like that a lot.

2022
02:17:43,940 --> 02:17:44,740
But then I moved.

2023
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:46,320
Because I got scared.

2024
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:47,860
I got scared.

2025
02:17:49,440 --> 02:17:52,320
I was just like, I'm just kidding.

2026
02:17:52,860 --> 02:17:54,300
Go look at the cart real quick.

2027
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:57,120
Alright, now...

2028
02:17:57,120 --> 02:17:58,280
Oh yeah, this has become the duck.

2029
02:17:59,780 --> 02:18:00,760
Wait, does it heal?

2030
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:02,240
Wait.

2031
02:18:02,820 --> 02:18:02,980
Wait.

2032
02:18:04,260 --> 02:18:05,140
Oh my god, wait.

2033
02:18:05,380 --> 02:18:06,560
That's actually...

2034
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:07,520
That seems broken.

2035
02:18:09,060 --> 02:18:10,480
That seems so broken.

2036
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:11,200
Not gonna lie.

2037
02:18:12,980 --> 02:18:14,240
Wait, is that broken?

2038
02:18:15,220 --> 02:18:15,660
Wait,

2039
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:20,620
you don't count when you're on the top of the cart?

2040
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:21,880
That's so dumb.

2041
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:22,820
Yeah.

2042
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:26,080

02:18:36,020 --> 02:18:36,760
Let's go!

2048
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:39,020
I didn't get it.

2049
02:18:39,180 --> 02:18:40,080
I really use it.

2050
02:18:43,160 --> 02:18:43,540
Alright.

2051
02:18:43,680 --> 02:18:44,420
I'll wait for the real one.

2052
02:18:44,660 --> 02:18:45,320
Oh, alright.

2053
02:18:49,230 --> 02:18:49,470
Alright.

02:18:55,050 --> 02:18:55,510
Just one, no one.

2058
02:18:56,230 --> 02:18:57,950
Oh, what the fuck?

We have real Gambit.

2061
02:19:10,070 --> 02:19:11,270
Come on.

2062
02:19:14,010 --> 02:19:15,950
I'm almost there, guys!

2063
02:19:16,930 --> 02:19:17,450
I don't have a DB.

2064
02:19:17,750 --> 02:19:18,170
Walk, walk, walk.

2065
02:19:18,810 --> 02:19:20,350
I'm so close!

2066
02:19:20,690 --> 02:19:23,090
That stupid fucking Ark is still there, too.

2067
02:19:24,150 --> 02:19:24,750
That's...

2068
02:19:37,750 --> 02:19:40,550
I don't know if that got anybody, but...

2069
02:19:41,650 --> 02:19:44,220
No, I died.

2070
02:19:44,780 --> 02:19:45,520
No, I got the gun.

2071
02:19:45,820 --> 02:19:47,180
No healers.

2072
02:19:48,720 --> 02:19:49,660
No healers.

2073
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:50,720
Uh, we don't have this.

2074
02:19:51,460 --> 02:19:53,640
Did we have TP yet?

2075
02:19:53,960 --> 02:19:54,360
No!

2076
02:19:54,820 --> 02:19:55,580
In 10 seconds.

2077
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:57,540
I should have it, hopefully.

2078
02:19:58,320 --> 02:20:00,340
No, I don't talk to people in rank.

2079
02:20:00,700 --> 02:20:01,280
I haven't.

2080
02:20:01,780 --> 02:20:01,960
I haven't.

2081
02:20:01,980 --> 02:20:08,000
Stay on, I can storm for TP if you die on, die on, die on Oh
my god, you need to die on, you can get Skynite No!

2082
02:20:09,780 --> 02:20:16,120
The current score is 2, 2, 0 It's okay.

2083
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:19,460
I just...

2084
02:20:19,460 --> 02:20:21,340
You know, I think I play perfectly.

2085
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:25,520
I don't know if I should keep playing Loki.

2086
02:20:26,560 --> 02:20:27,460
I'll keep playing Loki.

2087
02:20:28,060 --> 02:20:30,100
They have Moon Knight, but I'm still gonna do it.

2088
02:20:31,980 --> 02:20:45,860

I'm technically Gambit.

2093
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:11,360
I'm technically Gambit.

2094
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:14,460
I literally copy a Gambit.

2095
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:17,140
I'm Gambit like 10% of the time.

2096
02:21:17,220 --> 02:21:18,460
There we go.

2097
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:21,200

02:21:21,960 --> 02:21:22,440
It's crazy.

2100
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:25,700
I don't know how we keep getting matched up together in
these games.

2101
02:21:26,540 --> 02:21:28,460
It's like the wildest luck ever.

02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,280
Oh my god, he's not healthy though.

2107
02:22:10,900 --> 02:22:16,040
Oh, we might have been a little bit too cocky there.

2108
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:22,120
I think everybody's fine, right?

2109
02:22:24,660 --> 02:22:25,600
Not him though.

2110
02:22:26,680 --> 02:22:27,500
But I'm fine.

2111
02:22:28,420 --> 02:22:30,260
You better pick it up.

2112
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:37,600
Out here, out here.

2113
02:22:37,780 --> 02:22:39,920
Three, two, one.

2114
02:22:40,440 --> 02:22:41,000
Let's go.

2115
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:42,680
Go, go, go, go, go.

2116
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:44,080
Go, go, go, go, go.

2117
02:22:44,380 --> 02:22:46,100
Boom, boom, boom.

2118
02:22:46,740 --> 02:22:47,720
You have to get to get it.

2119
02:22:47,780 --> 02:22:48,020
Thanks.

2120
02:22:51,100 --> 02:22:51,760
All right, I'm okay.

2121
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:56,020
I just let them heal that.

2122
02:22:57,180 --> 02:23:00,620
All right, here we go.

2123
02:23:02,940 --> 02:23:05,840
I don't need to heal too much now.

2124
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:09,040
I have a feeling

2125
02:23:16,360 --> 02:23:18,560
Oh, where is she going?

2126
02:23:22,400 --> 02:23:22,700
Wow!

2127
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:24,360
Ha-ha!

2128
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:26,160
I'm fine.

2129
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:28,000
I'll just stay over here.

2130
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:30,020
That's where I don't go in no more.

2131
02:23:30,220 --> 02:23:30,760
You see that?

2132
02:23:30,860 --> 02:23:38,280
If I went in, that I knew, I knew that siloed, that siloed
was kind of up the moment I dashed in.

2133
02:23:38,340 --> 02:23:40,220
I was like, Fuck that shit.

2134
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:43,640
I'll be here in my little corner.

2135
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:47,520
I don't trust anybody.

2136
02:23:52,240 --> 02:23:53,200
Oh my.

2137
02:23:53,700 --> 02:23:55,060
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

2138
02:23:55,060 --> 02:23:55,980
I'm gonna die on point.

2139
02:23:57,080 --> 02:23:57,940
Yo, shoot him back!

2140
02:23:58,380 --> 02:23:59,460
I'm gonna die on point.

2141
02:24:00,480 --> 02:24:02,120
I was literally gone.

2142
02:24:04,140 --> 02:24:04,960
Oh my god.

2143
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:05,840
Where the fuck am I going?

2144
02:24:06,300 --> 02:24:07,580
Bro, I don't know this map at all.

2145
02:24:08,660 --> 02:24:09,020
Nothing.

2146
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:10,660
There we go.

2147
02:24:11,620 --> 02:24:11,720
Oh.

2148
02:24:11,860 --> 02:24:12,220

02:24:13,580 --> 02:24:13,600
Oh.

2152
02:24:14,560 --> 02:24:15,280
All right.

2153
02:24:15,460 --> 02:24:15,980
We pulled it in.

2154
02:24:16,420 --> 02:24:18,300
I got my ult.

2155
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:19,040
All right.

2156
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:20,640
Here we go.

2157
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:24,840
Yo, everybody walked in the, uh, care, care, care.

2158
02:24:24,860 --> 02:24:25,440

02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:26,220
Jump back through.

2160
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:26,780
Go through other side.

2161
02:24:26,860 --> 02:24:27,340
Go through the top.

2162
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:28,660
Come through, jump through, jump through.

2163
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:31,300
I don't, I don't.

2164
02:24:31,700 --> 02:24:33,120
Killer, killer, killer, anti, anti, anti.

2165

Well, cameras are dead.

2168
02:24:37,380 --> 02:24:38,640

Every triple tank we are.

2185
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:01,000
Technically, we're triple tank.

2186
02:26:01,660 --> 02:26:02,880
I'm gonna let him heal.

2187
02:26:04,260 --> 02:26:05,180

02:27:24,730 --> 02:27:24,830
Yeah.

2204
02:27:26,330 --> 02:27:28,050
Yo, yo, before we jump through the portal.

2205
02:27:28,630 --> 02:27:28,910
Copy me.

2206
02:27:29,390 --> 02:27:30,290
Don't, don't portal like that.

2207
02:27:30,590 --> 02:27:32,350
Copy me on the right and we just gambit all.

2208
02:27:32,510 --> 02:27:32,630
We win.

2209
02:27:32,890 --> 02:27:33,190
We have time.

2210
02:27:33,270 --> 02:27:33,410
We time.

2211
02:27:33,470 --> 02:27:33,790
Don't rush it.

2212
02:27:33,810 --> 02:27:34,130
Don't rush it.

2213
02:27:34,770 --> 02:27:35,070
Copy me.

2214
02:27:35,090 --> 02:27:36,530
Let's go, go, go, go.

2215
02:27:37,010 --> 02:27:37,390
Oh yeah.

2216
02:27:40,030 --> 02:27:40,650
Entity, Entity.

2217
02:27:51,890 --> 02:27:53,990
Oh my god, it's you and me.

2218
02:27:57,290 --> 02:27:57,830
That's unlucky.

2219
02:27:59,010 --> 02:27:59,190
Oh!

2220
02:28:03,960 --> 02:28:05,180
I feel like...

2221
02:28:05,180 --> 02:28:05,660
I don't know.

2222
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:08,080
I think I should...

2223
02:28:08,080 --> 02:28:09,500
I don't know if I should swap.

2224
02:28:11,780 --> 02:28:13,360
The Moon Knight isn't doing shit.

2225
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:14,180
We'll see.

2226
02:28:15,020 --> 02:28:16,020
But we do have...

2227
02:28:16,020 --> 02:28:17,440
Okay, we're not doing triple tank no more.

2228
02:28:20,100 --> 02:28:20,500
Alright.

2229
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:22,280
What?

2230
02:28:24,220 --> 02:28:27,660
I feel like you should swap only because they are running
Moon Knight, but like...

2231
02:28:28,360 --> 02:28:29,040
I don't...

2232
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:30,600
I'll save my dashes.

2233
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:31,860
It's like that side...

2234
02:28:31,860 --> 02:28:34,120
Yeah, I'm just gonna swap to Invis after.

2235
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:37,920
Say bye, say bye, see you.

2236
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:38,140
Nice.

2237
02:28:38,700 --> 02:28:39,000
Alright.

2238
02:28:39,540 --> 02:28:40,780
I'm saving mine for the match.

2239
02:28:40,980 --> 02:28:41,380
You need to live.

2240
02:28:41,460 --> 02:28:41,760
You need to live.

2241
02:28:45,240 --> 02:28:46,340
Oh my god, oh my god.

2242
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:48,480
Oh my god, yeah.

2243
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:49,380
I know, I know.

2244
02:28:49,660 --> 02:28:51,560
Sealing our bag is one of your...

2245
02:28:52,240 --> 02:28:53,340
Yeah, that sucks.

2246
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:55,900
He's just... I'm just gonna invis.

2247
02:28:56,180 --> 02:28:57,640
I think I should just invis.

2248
02:28:58,200 --> 02:28:58,200
Yeah.

2249
02:28:59,080 --> 02:28:59,820
Big, big!

2250
02:29:00,440 --> 02:29:01,920
I think invis is worth it.

2251
02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:07,040
If it's like, they don't farm that and then I can fend for
myself or Scylla.

2252
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:08,680
We're gonna lose.

2253
02:29:08,860 --> 02:29:09,320
I don't ever send.

2254
02:29:09,420 --> 02:29:09,700
Don't ever send.

2255
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:10,260
You only want support.

2256
02:29:10,340 --> 02:29:10,620
I'm reloading.

2257
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:10,800
Reloading.

2258
02:29:11,080 --> 02:29:12,140
Oh my god, it's so far.

2259
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:21,400
you're ready to pull tight because you have no map you can
allow yeah everybody needs to play there i can't hear you oh

2260
02:29:21,400 --> 02:29:22,560
i forgot about the map

2261
02:29:29,480 --> 02:29:42,000
nice good pick yep there you go that's the question go
through go through

2262
02:29:49,640 --> 02:30:01,020
yeah all right i knew it i knew going in this was the play i
figured like jesus 50 oh my god yeah i had a feeling i was

2263
02:30:01,020 --> 02:30:09,200
like i don't think i should play doki i feel like the moon
night is doing too much it's doing way too much yo what do

2264
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:21,120
you think of the map doki bro i i but I fucking hate the new
map okay it's because it's it's so orange it's actually

2265
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:30,180
really close you don't like it bro it's just it's I like the
intensity oh my god wait sorry I'm in time square I gotta

2266
02:30:30,180 --> 02:30:40,400
leave time square music too it's really good bro it's just
it's so orange it's it's okay and okay to be fair it's like

2267
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:42,740
it's so confusing There's so many rooms, too.

2268
02:30:43,560 --> 02:30:44,400
I really like...

2269
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:47,400
I think it'll mix things up, and that's what I like.

2270
02:30:47,940 --> 02:30:49,520
Yeah, what you like better.

2271
02:30:49,980 --> 02:30:53,540
I think it's like it'll change some stuff.

2272
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:54,320
I like the way there are...

2273
02:30:54,320 --> 02:30:55,480
I like the last point.

2274
02:30:55,640 --> 02:30:56,540
The last point's cool.

2275
02:30:57,080 --> 02:30:58,700
Like, you can put your clones in the last...

2276
02:30:58,700 --> 02:31:01,360
Like, on the bouncy thing, too.

2277
02:31:01,740 --> 02:31:03,440
The bouncy thing is really cool.

2278
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:04,540
I have to agree.

2279
02:31:04,820 --> 02:31:09,060
But that also doesn't count as being on point, which is kind
of stupid, in my opinion.

2280
02:31:09,760 --> 02:31:11,260
If you're up top, it doesn't count.

2281
02:31:11,400 --> 02:31:12,400
You could see nine really.

2282
02:31:12,660 --> 02:31:15,000
Yeah, I think like, because those are my second time on that
map.

2283
02:31:15,220 --> 02:31:20,320
And like, I remember like, there's, on the second point,
there's so many rooms that just lead nowhere.

2284
02:31:20,660 --> 02:31:21,780
It's so confusing.

2285
02:31:23,300 --> 02:31:27,520
Like, I think the walk back, too, to the point is very long.

2286
02:31:27,700 --> 02:31:28,400
I feel like.

2287
02:31:28,660 --> 02:31:33,200
I'm not sure if it's because there's so many rooms or just
the fact that it just feels longer.

2288
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:34,200
I think it's because we just don't know the map yet.

2289
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:34,720
Yeah, yeah.

2290
02:31:34,780 --> 02:31:35,460
Like, that's it.

2291
02:31:36,020 --> 02:31:37,520
Dude, I walked into the fucking wall.

2292
02:31:37,600 --> 02:31:39,260
I was backing up and I left the wall.

2293
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:50,160
it's so weird what's it called areas where you can't shoot
your gun through that's actually good encourages brawl

2294
02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:59,180
fights which is really good i love that wait what you're
doing there were rooms you can't shoot it i can't shoot out

2295
02:31:59,180 --> 02:32:07,680
of there's little areas that block heat and block damage oh
my god yellow things that's why i couldn't kill the siloed

2296
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:16,540
oh that makes so much more sense now I shot a silo like
three times and I was like why is this she taking damage

2297
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:26,980
it's good for brawls because you can play more oh my god
that makes so much more sense now I was just like there's no

2298
02:32:26,980 --> 02:32:41,720
way he doesn't take one damage like I didn't even notice
that it's just like that that makes so much more sense so

2299
02:32:41,720 --> 02:32:52,820
that's uh also deadly kitten thank you for the 300 videos
thank you thank you now we need to win i like two more games

2300
02:32:52,820 --> 02:33:05,280
oh my god get me out what if it's three more games no no no
no what if

2301
02:33:08,300 --> 02:33:18,280
oh man that would be so unfortunate also I just realized
Kingsman's Twitch account is Kingsman 265 underscore Twitch

2302
02:33:18,280 --> 02:33:29,740
I don't think this I don't think my buddy knows that he can
claim a better username now that he's partner he he can

2303
02:33:29,740 --> 02:33:37,600
literally be Kingsman right now yeah Probably not.

2304
02:33:39,300 --> 02:33:41,220
I think, honestly, you should just...

2305
02:33:41,220 --> 02:33:42,420
You should rip it with that.

2306
02:33:42,640 --> 02:33:43,640
That should be his bread.

2307
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:46,440
It's his identity now.

2308
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:48,920
Kingsman265 underscore Twitch.

2309
02:33:52,540 --> 02:33:53,720
Bro, you could...

2310
02:33:53,720 --> 02:33:54,700
Literally, you could...

2311
02:33:54,700 --> 02:33:55,560
The worst part?

2312
02:33:55,860 --> 02:33:57,640
I can't even claim Doki.

2313
02:33:58,060 --> 02:34:00,900
Because it's a actual Rainbow Six Siege Pro.

2314
02:34:01,220 --> 02:34:02,520
Like, he was there first.

2315
02:34:03,480 --> 02:34:05,920
What do you mean, Imperator?

2316
02:34:06,400 --> 02:34:09,940
I was solo-keeling, and then, like, you just asked me.

2317
02:34:10,820 --> 02:34:11,880
I didn't take your duo.

2318
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:13,680
Your duo...

2319
02:34:15,480 --> 02:34:18,600
Your duo went hose before bros.

2320
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:19,870
That's not my fault.

2321
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:31,880
That's Mr. Kingsman 2695 underscore Twitch to you.

2322
02:34:36,530 --> 02:34:37,630
My bro.

2323
02:34:38,250 --> 02:34:39,470
Alright, let's go.

2324
02:34:39,830 --> 02:34:41,570
I feel cloaky today.

2325
02:34:43,690 --> 02:34:45,070
Or bros before hoes.

2326
02:34:45,330 --> 02:34:47,030
Either works, honestly.

2327
02:34:48,230 --> 02:34:50,690
I don't know if Imperator is a ho or not.

2328
02:34:51,690 --> 02:34:52,370
Imp, are you a ho?

2329
02:34:54,270 --> 02:34:55,550
Or are you a bro?

2330
02:34:58,510 --> 02:34:59,310
I'm a bro.

2331
02:35:01,250 --> 02:35:02,610
I'm a boy ho.

2332
02:35:02,750 --> 02:35:05,590
Oh, so yeah, your bro went bros before hoes.

2333
02:35:05,650 --> 02:35:06,750
He chose...

2334
02:35:06,750 --> 02:35:07,850
He chose the bro.

2335
02:35:07,870 --> 02:35:09,050
Can I get a booster please?

2336
02:35:09,530 --> 02:35:11,530
You can't ask that.

2337
02:35:15,880 --> 02:35:16,340
Oh wait.

2338
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:17,260
Yeah.

2339
02:35:17,920 --> 02:35:18,920
Thank you.

2340
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:24,700
Yeah, Kingsman did pick the bro.

2341
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:25,880
I think I'll get it.

2342
02:35:26,280 --> 02:35:26,740
I got it.

2343
02:35:26,740 --> 02:35:27,160
I got it.

2344
02:35:27,160 --> 02:35:27,400
Thank you.

2345
02:35:27,480 --> 02:35:27,840
Damn.

2346
02:35:28,080 --> 02:35:29,840
You gotta find a main piece, bro.

2347
02:35:31,060 --> 02:35:33,920
You can't be hoeing it up your entire life.

2348
02:35:34,120 --> 02:35:34,660
Oh my god.

2349
02:35:34,740 --> 02:35:37,280
There's a Wolverine camping and I'm fucking...

2350
02:35:37,400 --> 02:35:39,100
I'm noveling, but I'm gonna die.

2351
02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:40,480
Yeah, yeah, no, you can't.

2352
02:35:41,860 --> 02:35:44,220
Bro, you got to sell that one, then.

2353
02:35:44,440 --> 02:35:47,500
That guy and, uh, be downy, I think.

2354
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:49,340
I think that could be good here.

2355
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:50,900
Maybe, like, Phoenix.

2356
02:35:51,800 --> 02:35:52,340
What the?

2357
02:35:53,320 --> 02:35:54,160
Where's my...

2358
02:35:54,160 --> 02:35:55,280
Clicking his wall, by the way.

2359
02:35:55,360 --> 02:35:55,880
He's gonna be moving.

2360
02:36:00,620 --> 02:36:01,400
Alright, here we go.

2361
02:36:03,820 --> 02:36:05,200
Everything is fine.

2362
02:36:06,780 --> 02:36:08,240
Everything is so fine.

2363
02:36:08,640 --> 02:36:09,060
Oh my god!

2364
02:36:09,160 --> 02:36:09,820
Everything is fine.

2365
02:36:09,940 --> 02:36:10,540
They have no mag.

2366
02:36:11,340 --> 02:36:11,640
Wait.

2367
02:36:12,060 --> 02:36:13,020
That's my dream.

2368
02:36:13,820 --> 02:36:14,460
Oh, my God.

2369
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:15,180
He's coming closer.

2370
02:36:15,320 --> 02:36:16,040
He's coming closer.

2371
02:36:16,920 --> 02:36:18,320
He's coming so much closer.

2372
02:36:23,400 --> 02:36:24,140
I don't know.

2373
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:28,160
Jeff and Cloakio is a little...

2374
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:31,780
I'm gonna go wallbreak Iron Man.

2375
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:32,580
Oh, okay.

2376
02:36:32,620 --> 02:36:33,020
There you go.

2377
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:35,000
I got a little worried.

2378
02:36:35,640 --> 02:36:35,820
I...

2379
02:36:37,020 --> 02:36:38,220
I really did.

2380
02:36:39,960 --> 02:36:42,220
I got a little worried there.

2381
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:45,080
Ah, we can go in, right?

2382
02:36:45,400 --> 02:36:46,620
Yeah, fuck it.

2383
02:36:48,660 --> 02:36:49,740
Oh, I'm going back.

2384
02:36:49,980 --> 02:36:51,540
I can see he's going to grab me.

2385
02:36:53,540 --> 02:36:54,940
I can feel it.

2386
02:36:55,240 --> 02:36:56,380
I risked.

2387
02:36:57,960 --> 02:36:59,640
You ain't fooling me.

2388
02:37:00,480 --> 02:37:01,760
I know what you are.

2389
02:37:03,860 --> 02:37:05,720
I knew he was going to grab me.

2390
02:37:07,420 --> 02:37:09,140
Wait, now he doesn't want to play me.

2391
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:13,940
I'm about I'm leaving She learned

2392
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:30,700
Alright here we go Let's go Yeah I Oh there we go I was
gonna say I don't think Jeff is gonna work here only because

2393
02:37:30,700 --> 02:37:44,720
I don't think this guy is a pro Jeff player so that Oh don't
worry I got this Oh no Okay, I did say, what if it's three

2394
02:37:44,720 --> 02:37:45,760
more games?

2395
02:37:48,300 --> 02:37:51,340
Oh, did I accidentally jinxed him?

2396
02:37:51,620 --> 02:37:54,760
Ooh, that is my bad.

2397
02:37:55,200 --> 02:37:56,520
You know, I never...

2398
02:37:56,520 --> 02:38:00,240
I didn't think that it would actually be three games.

2399
02:38:00,420 --> 02:38:02,800
We gotta use it because it's been three minutes, so we gotta
just go with it.

2400
02:38:04,360 --> 02:38:04,920
Classic.

2401
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:15,280
Look, when I said it could be three games, I didn't think it
could actually be He's still behind by the way.

2402
02:38:17,060 --> 02:38:18,700
He's like getting hardcore staggered right now.

2403
02:38:20,180 --> 02:38:22,140
Is he still getting staggered?

2404
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:24,480
There we go.

One, two, two.

02:49:29,720 --> 02:49:32,000
Oh man, it almost worked.

2582
02:49:32,140 --> 02:49:32,960
I flinched.

2583
02:49:33,020 --> 02:49:33,960

2584
02:49:34,260 --> 02:49:34,560
I flinched.

2585
02:49:36,280 --> 02:49:37,920
I don't even know.

2586
02:49:40,920 --> 02:50:08,230

from matching it up.

2591
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:54,740
You can't avoid the queues.

2592
02:50:56,280 --> 02:50:58,640
Now that I know, I'll play at this time.

2593
02:51:04,680 --> 02:51:06,440
All according to plan.

2594
02:51:11,470 --> 02:51:13,730
I'm so mad that I can't duel people.

2595
02:51:13,950 --> 02:51:17,130
I can't fucking duel people while I'm queuing.

2596
02:51:17,810 --> 02:51:21,650
Why can't I beat up the bronze and silvers?

2597
02:51:23,270 --> 02:51:27,710
When I lose a game, I mean, like, time to queue up some
clobbering club.

2598
02:51:29,030 --> 02:51:29,570
Oh, my God.

2599
02:51:29,650 --> 02:51:30,610
Thank you for the raid.

2600
02:51:30,870 --> 02:51:31,770
I did... End game.

2601
02:51:32,070 --> 02:51:33,110
End game, by the way.

2602
02:51:33,190 --> 02:51:33,690
End game.

2603
02:51:33,990 --> 02:51:35,530
Thank you for the raid, Kingsman.

2604
02:51:36,130 --> 02:51:38,350
I hope you get one above all tomorrow.

2605
02:51:38,510 --> 02:51:39,530
Three more games.

2606
02:51:39,690 --> 02:51:41,050
And it could be four more games.

2607
02:51:41,250 --> 02:51:42,910
And maybe five more games.

2608
02:51:43,270 --> 02:51:45,250
But eventually, you could get there.

2609
02:51:45,370 --> 02:51:45,970
I believe.

2610
02:51:49,290 --> 02:51:49,750
I...

2611
02:51:49,750 --> 02:51:50,490

02:52:29,510 --> 02:52:38,010
variety streamer and then whenever i have time i i just

2619
02:52:44,330 --> 02:52:47,430
twitch yeah it's my second job i clock in on my second job

2620
02:52:53,490 --> 02:52:55,450
I actually enjoy the game.

2621
02:52:55,970 --> 02:52:58,470
I play it as my cool down period.

2622
02:52:58,670 --> 02:53:05,430
But then when I'm not cooling down, and then I finally, I
keep forgetting that weekend queues are like a special breed

2623
02:53:05,430 --> 02:53:06,810
of players.

2624
02:53:08,430 --> 02:53:11,810
And then, because and then I got like, it's crazy.

2625
02:53:12,070 --> 02:53:13,730
For the Kingsman viewers, it's crazy.

2626
02:53:13,910 --> 02:53:19,630
Like this guy was like mentioning Kingsman and stuff.

2627
02:53:20,170 --> 02:53:22,770
And then like, he was like flaming me.

2628
02:53:23,310 --> 02:53:29,610
and because like the other support was like what like he was
flaming the other support and i was like yeah the other

2629
02:53:29,610 --> 02:53:35,050
support like i was just like all right yeah they didn't
really perform that great and the other support who was chat

2630
02:53:35,050 --> 02:53:42,810
bad told his duo to like try and get him to flame me instead
because he's like um it's not me but it's dokey bird's fault

2631
02:53:42,810 --> 02:53:54,150
and i was like um excuse me like i was just like what the i
see like yeah and i was just like what the the fuck why did

2632
02:53:54,150 --> 02:54:04,530
you like pawn it off on me i didn't say nothing i i didn't
even say anything and and i'm like bro if you were chat bad

2633
02:54:04,530 --> 02:54:12,070
this something is wrong too like if you are chat bad maybe
you are the problem because i've never been chat bad since

2634
02:54:12,070 --> 02:54:24,090
this game came out yeah and then and then the guy started
like using kingsman to blame me and i thought it was And

2635
02:54:24,090 --> 02:54:30,310
then I ended up playing with Kingsman today, and I was like,
to my chat, I was like, to that guy that flayed me, I will

2636
02:54:30,310 --> 02:54:33,210
play with all your Idols to make you feel like shit.

2637
02:54:33,650 --> 02:54:43,610
Like, like somehow, like, somehow it was such a funny
coincidence, because this Idol was like Kingsman too.

2638
02:54:45,690 --> 02:54:47,830
And I was like, I will play with all your Idols.

2639
02:54:47,830 --> 02:55:02,950
out of spite now so you'll see me everywhere now that's
right you're gonna see me everywhere can't fucking avoid me

2640
02:55:09,570 --> 02:55:17,690
but yeah anyway i do play a lot of fps i i was first for
those the new viewers i was first known as like an fps

2641
02:55:17,690 --> 02:55:24,430
player so i was apex predator and apex legends and i was uh
top five and Overwatch 1 and 2.

2642
02:55:25,990 --> 02:55:28,190
And then Top 500 and Marvel Rivals.

2643
02:55:28,750 --> 02:55:38,270
So like, the thing I, what I do is that I get Top 500 in
video, in like games I like and then I stop caring.

2644
02:55:38,590 --> 02:55:40,330
Because I'm like, I did it.

2645
02:55:40,710 --> 02:55:42,430
I'm just gonna vibe now.

2646
02:55:42,730 --> 02:55:43,770
And I hate that vibe.

2647
02:55:43,890 --> 02:55:48,310
I used to use the word vibe like, unironically.

2648
02:55:48,510 --> 02:55:50,130
And now I can't anymore.

2649
02:55:50,330 --> 02:55:52,390
Because the word vibe is gone now.

2650
02:55:52,450 --> 02:56:04,970
It's ruined it's it's like ruined now oh yeah and i was
technically top 500 in splatoon 1 2 and 3 because like they

2651
02:56:04,970 --> 02:56:10,810
don't really have leaderboards but they do have like the
highest i was the highest rank in splatoon when it first

2652
02:56:10,810 --> 02:56:17,530
came out i literally just like and then after i get it i
just stop i just stop playing like playing it as much

2653
02:56:17,530 --> 02:56:23,970
because i'm like well i scratched the itch you like it's
like you got it and you're like i don't have a goal anymore

2654
02:56:23,970 --> 02:56:39,570
type deal so it's more so like i just play for fun all right
let's see i'll kill time i want to relax wait did they ban

2655
02:56:39,570 --> 02:56:44,170
invis oh they did yeah i'm not copying the rocket

2656
02:56:47,870 --> 02:56:57,290
yeah job done it's like job done all right time to chill
that's why i haven't like grinding rivals in a long time

2657
02:56:57,290 --> 02:57:06,370
because i just like if they don't commit to me i'm also very
busy too behind the scenes so i get so it's like whenever i

2658
02:57:06,370 --> 02:57:14,590
get a break i'm like time to boot up marvel rivals we're
doing top five bro high guard is gonna be so frustrating to

2659
02:57:14,590 --> 02:57:28,230
play in general i got seems like such a whoa how the fuck
did i lose 80 of my hp i was in the bubble that's triple

2660
02:57:28,230 --> 02:57:41,030
yeah that's triple good bye so long i don't think he's
coming back i swear i don't think that guy's coming back it

2661
02:57:41,030 --> 02:57:53,990
does i think i think they are all right i oh man he was so
close i do think uh high guard the devs for high guard is

2662
02:57:53,990 --> 02:58:03,910
listening for those who didn't know uh they added 5v5 they
actually they added 5v5 they they do listen because they are

2663
02:58:03,910 --> 02:58:19,830
an indie studio so but i don't it's like more so like is it
too late oh i live let's go oh i was gonna oh thank god i

2664
02:58:19,830 --> 02:58:26,810
did it i would have lost it Yo, Anami, what are you playing?

2665
02:58:27,790 --> 02:58:28,230
Fuck.

2666
02:58:29,690 --> 02:58:30,950
Yeah, I need you to go Moon Knight now.

2667
02:58:31,110 --> 02:58:31,810
I need you to go Moon Knight.

2668
02:58:34,110 --> 02:58:37,990
Yeah, they added 5e5 and they like fixed...

2669
02:58:37,990 --> 02:58:40,510
I did not realize that they did not have...

2670
02:58:40,510 --> 02:58:42,330
It was crouch to toggle.

2671
02:58:42,510 --> 02:58:44,130
I did not realize that.

2672
02:58:44,270 --> 02:58:46,010
Like it was crouch to toggle.

2673
02:58:46,050 --> 02:58:49,690
I was wondering why the fucking game was so slow paced.

2674
02:58:49,730 --> 02:58:50,930
It was so hard to crouch.

2675
02:58:52,250 --> 02:58:53,730
I did not realize that.

2676
02:58:53,890 --> 02:58:55,910
I was like, that makes so much sense now.

2677
02:58:55,970 --> 02:58:56,700
You know, fuck it.

2678
02:58:58,010 --> 02:58:58,630
Oh, fuck.

2679
02:58:58,990 --> 02:59:00,150
Can I charge it a little bit?

2680
02:59:00,290 --> 02:59:01,370
No, I lived.

2681
02:59:02,770 --> 02:59:03,830
Oh, thank you, Helen.

2682
02:59:13,660 --> 02:59:14,660
Holy shit.

2683
02:59:15,200 --> 02:59:16,060
My hero.

2684
02:59:16,700 --> 02:59:18,840
He took that for the team.

2685
02:59:20,940 --> 02:59:21,440
Oh.

2686
02:59:24,480 --> 02:59:26,820
I dodged, like, so much.

2687
02:59:27,580 --> 02:59:30,580
Oh, but what if...

2688
02:59:32,920 --> 02:59:37,000
Oh, wait, where's my team?

2689
02:59:37,980 --> 02:59:38,460
That's right.

2690
02:59:39,500 --> 02:59:40,600
I'll still live.

2691
02:59:41,540 --> 02:59:43,440
I'll still live.

2692
02:59:44,200 --> 02:59:45,240
That's acting right.

2693
02:59:46,780 --> 02:59:49,920
Nothing will kill me.

2694
02:59:52,260 --> 02:59:53,740
Oh, that's cool.

2695
02:59:54,400 --> 02:59:54,620

Steve did not kill Jeff!

2717
03:01:39,540 --> 03:01:42,540
I had to turn around.

2718
03:01:43,120 --> 03:01:47,020
I had to turn around and fucking kill him myself.

2719
03:01:47,660 --> 03:01:48,880
What do you mean?

2720
03:01:49,800 --> 03:01:52,420
I saw our Magnus and Jeff.

2721
03:01:55,460 --> 03:01:58,320
I thought I was the EOMM agent.

2722
03:01:58,940 --> 03:02:01,260
I realized everyone was.

2723
03:02:03,780 --> 03:02:04,980
Oh my god.

2724
03:02:05,160 --> 03:02:08,640
I literally just saw that Magnus to point blank too.

2725
03:02:09,020 --> 03:02:10,160
That's crazy.

2726
03:02:12,540 --> 03:02:16,620
Yeah, I willingly consensually play this game off stream, by
the way.

2727
03:02:17,240 --> 03:02:20,640
But then I stream when I get mad at this game.

2728
03:02:21,200 --> 03:02:23,700
But only because of the players, not because of me.

2729
03:02:24,180 --> 03:02:25,500
Because I play this game perfectly.

2730
03:02:26,940 --> 03:02:28,220
Just don't give it a try, bud.

2731
03:02:29,540 --> 03:02:31,580
I mean, I don't know, bro.

2732
03:02:31,800 --> 03:02:33,720
Jeff's solo is all joined by himself.

2733
03:02:34,080 --> 03:02:34,820
Yeah, that was...

2734
03:02:34,820 --> 03:02:36,600
No, that was unfortunate to watch.

2735
03:02:37,380 --> 03:02:38,320
I held three of them out there.

2736
03:02:38,400 --> 03:02:39,280
Make sure they couldn't come in.

2737
03:02:39,600 --> 03:02:41,940
Yeah, I came back and turned around to...

2785
03:06:10,020 --> 03:06:11,920
I gotta cool it down after that.

2786
03:06:13,440 --> 03:06:14,480
That's surprising.

2787
03:06:14,720 --> 03:06:16,620
You know, mock cues are...

2788
03:06:16,620 --> 03:06:18,000
Mock cues are wild.

2789
03:06:18,460 --> 03:06:19,600
Because I always say this.

2790
03:06:19,760 --> 03:06:20,180

Hey, Ruben.

Do you need me to...

2816
03:08:02,810 --> 03:08:05,610
You need me to blow some people out of my mind or Bob?

2817
03:08:05,770 --> 03:08:06,330
What do you mean?

2818
03:08:07,370 --> 03:08:08,330
What do you mean, Ruben?

2819
03:08:12,840 --> 03:08:13,280
Alright.

2820
03:08:13,520 --> 03:08:15,360
What am I feeling right now?

2821
03:08:15,620 --> 03:08:16,640
I'll play this.

2822
03:08:16,780 --> 03:08:17,180
Oh, wait.

2823
03:08:17,200 --> 03:08:17,800
That's a bad.

2824
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:19,280
I keep forgetting that.

2825
03:08:19,580 --> 03:08:22,700
Give you, like, five seconds to pre-pick a character.

2826
03:08:26,420 --> 03:08:28,360
Oh, oh, yeah, oh, my title.

2827
03:08:28,500 --> 03:08:29,660
I already forgot my title.

2828
03:08:32,260 --> 03:08:33,160
My title.

2829
03:08:38,550 --> 03:08:39,490
No, it's crazy.

2830
03:08:40,550 --> 03:08:42,290
Weekend queues are fucking wild.

2831
03:08:42,530 --> 03:08:47,690
We literally, when the screen first started, it was like
four out of four.

2832
03:08:47,790 --> 03:08:48,850
It was a three or four.

2833
03:08:49,150 --> 03:08:54,590
It was like four out of four games where everyone was just
fucking blaming each other like non-stop.

2834
03:08:54,950 --> 03:08:56,630
I was just like, damn.

2835
03:09:00,270 --> 03:09:02,630
Like, everyone was just depressed.

2836
03:09:04,850 --> 03:09:07,190
And then I'm monetizing their depression right now.

2837
03:09:11,080 --> 03:09:12,340
Like, don't worry, buddy.

2838
03:09:15,020 --> 03:09:16,300
We're all here for you.

2839
03:09:21,590 --> 03:09:23,450
That's my Oshi.

2840
03:09:26,550 --> 03:09:28,350
Oh, yeah, he's like the...

2841
03:09:28,350 --> 03:09:30,350
He's like the Rule 34 guy now.

2842
03:09:33,830 --> 03:09:36,670
Yeah, the true content creation grind.

2843
03:09:36,970 --> 03:09:37,650
Ah, yes.

2844
03:09:38,330 --> 03:09:38,910
Capitalism.

2845
03:09:39,210 --> 03:09:40,490
Mickey Mouse is my Oshi.

2846
03:09:40,970 --> 03:09:41,450
He's my idol.

2847
03:09:41,990 --> 03:09:43,010
I've always said that.

2848
03:09:43,450 --> 03:09:45,230
He's like literally the king of capitalism.

2849
03:09:46,690 --> 03:09:48,350
Or should I say, I guess like Disney.

2850
03:09:49,830 --> 03:09:51,770
He's the king of capitalism.

2851
03:09:52,950 --> 03:09:53,730
One day.

2852
03:09:55,350 --> 03:09:56,830
The capitalist mouse.

2853
03:10:07,620 --> 03:10:09,960
But I'll get rid of all these.

2854
03:10:13,380 --> 03:10:15,560
Oh yeah, I love the skins.

2855
03:10:16,600 --> 03:10:17,420
I will save.

2856
03:10:18,900 --> 03:10:19,880
I will save.

2857
03:10:22,180 --> 03:10:26,660
I am the consumer that they want.

2858
03:10:28,880 --> 03:10:31,280
Like I know what type of game it is.

2859
03:10:35,360 --> 03:10:35,940
Yeah.

2860
03:10:38,080 --> 03:10:38,960
Oh shit.

2861
03:10:39,740 --> 03:10:42,620
Oh my god, Moon, are you fucking crazy?

2862
03:10:42,780 --> 03:10:43,680
You're not a tank, bro.

2863
03:10:45,420 --> 03:10:47,260
Oh shit, not triple support.

2864
03:10:47,500 --> 03:10:48,160
They really want to...

2865
03:10:48,160 --> 03:10:49,480
When would I get triple support?

2866
03:10:50,560 --> 03:10:51,400
What the fuck?

2867
03:10:52,360 --> 03:10:55,460
I'm always the duo supporter, not the triple support.

2868
03:10:56,200 --> 03:10:56,880
Not fair.

2869
03:10:58,160 --> 03:10:59,400
Get over here.

2870
03:10:59,660 --> 03:11:00,580
Go go go go go go.

2871
03:11:03,460 --> 03:11:04,620
Where can I score?

2872
03:11:10,080 --> 03:11:10,560

2876
03:11:44,140 --> 03:11:44,240
Oh.

2877
03:11:50,560 --> 03:11:57,620
I can't use this aggressively too because it's they're like,
run up!

2878
03:11:57,960 --> 03:11:58,960
You're not alive.

2879
03:12:00,280 --> 03:12:01,560
You're not alive.

2880
03:12:07,400 --> 03:12:10,560
Unfortunately, not him though.

2881
03:12:12,540 --> 03:12:12,820
Not...

2882
03:12:13,900 --> 03:12:15,500
Not him, unfortunately.

2883
03:12:19,650 --> 03:12:20,730
Wait for me, Moon Knight.

2884
03:12:20,850 --> 03:12:21,170

2885
03:12:24,230 --> 03:12:25,270
Oh my god, does he actually?

2886
03:12:25,550 --> 03:12:25,910
We don't need it.

2887
03:12:25,910 --> 03:12:26,210
We don't need it.

2888
03:12:26,310 --> 03:12:27,330
Just go here, just go here, go here, go here.

2889
03:12:27,350 --> 03:12:28,130
Oh, not born again.

2890
03:12:31,230 --> 03:12:32,590
Oh god, already?

2891
03:12:33,190 --> 03:12:33,850
That's crazy.

2892
03:12:34,270 --> 03:12:35,570
Oh my god, it was an attempt.

2893
03:12:35,650 --> 03:12:36,770
I really appreciate that.

2894
03:12:37,210 --> 03:12:37,690
You tried.

2895
03:12:37,990 --> 03:12:39,410
You really...

2896
03:12:39,410 --> 03:12:41,390
You really tried, you know.

2897
03:12:42,170 --> 03:12:52,990

I thought the gamers don't look up.

2902
03:13:19,990 --> 03:13:21,550
Oh, don't worry, you're alive.

2903
03:13:26,730 --> 03:13:29,970
Jesus Christ, there is my little fucking alt battery right

That's right.

You don't see me over here.

2908
03:13:45,030 --> 03:13:46,950
I think this is very dumb to play.

2909
03:13:50,190 --> 03:13:51,570
What do you mean?

2910
03:13:53,670 --> 03:13:54,470
Oh my...

2911
03:13:56,720 --> 03:13:57,340
It's okay.

2912
03:13:59,020 --> 03:13:59,620
Take her off.

2913
03:13:59,680 --> 03:14:00,060
Bring her off.

2914
03:14:00,260 --> 03:14:00,960
Oh my god, it's okay.

2915
03:14:01,100 --> 03:14:01,860
We're so healthy.

2916
03:14:04,520 --> 03:14:04,820
Oh my god.

2917
03:14:04,960 --> 03:14:06,120
We are so healthy!

2918
03:14:07,420 --> 03:14:08,200
Oh my god.

2919
03:14:09,180 --> 03:14:09,580
It's okay.

2920
03:14:09,980 --> 03:14:11,320
I have this little hole.

2921
03:14:12,320 --> 03:14:13,780
It's so healthy.

2922
03:14:15,540 --> 03:14:16,180
There you go.

2923
03:14:16,440 --> 03:14:17,400
I don't know.

2924
03:14:17,960 --> 03:14:18,720
That just worked.

2925
03:14:19,580 --> 03:14:20,240
I live.

2926
03:14:23,080 --> 03:14:24,600
Oh my gosh.

2927
03:14:24,840 --> 03:14:26,740
I told you, I never lie.

2928
03:14:27,300 --> 03:14:28,500
We are healthy.

2929
03:14:32,420 --> 03:14:34,040
I told you.

2930
03:14:34,340 --> 03:14:37,320
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

2931
03:14:37,760 --> 03:14:39,100
I would lie about that.

2932
03:14:40,940 --> 03:14:43,540
If you believe in it, you will live.

2933
03:14:45,080 --> 03:14:45,580
Guys.

2934
03:14:48,100 --> 03:14:53,520
If you believe that you're healthy, you never have to go see
a doctor again.

2935
03:14:54,120 --> 03:14:54,620
In game.

2936
03:14:54,880 --> 03:14:55,200
In game.

2937
03:14:55,460 --> 03:14:58,220
Please see a doctor if you're not feeling it.

2938
03:15:00,380 --> 03:15:04,400
In game, by the way, if you are not healthy, please see a
doctor.

2939
03:15:06,140 --> 03:15:09,300
And also get health insurance if you're American.

2940
03:15:16,500 --> 03:15:17,840
That's how it works.

2941
03:15:20,400 --> 03:15:20,700
Yay.

We're back.

2960
03:17:14,530 --> 03:17:14,650
Yeah.

2961
03:17:14,730 --> 03:17:23,810

going he could have he could have hit that you know he was

2962
03:17:23,810 --> 03:17:26,490

hours

2963
03:17:30,170 --> 03:17:31,670

2964
03:17:35,130 --> 03:17:46,090
uh let us win i guess that dance club is not what it's like
That's not what it used to be.

2965
03:17:47,050 --> 03:17:49,490
I missed the old dance club.

2966
03:17:50,450 --> 03:17:51,510
The one where...

2967
03:17:51,510 --> 03:17:52,430
Jesus, fucking Chris.

2968
03:17:52,630 --> 03:17:53,750
That's a big-ass sidewalk.

2969
03:17:54,610 --> 03:17:55,050
Oh, my God.

2970
03:17:55,270 --> 03:17:55,830
That's a John.

2971
03:17:55,990 --> 03:17:56,550
That's Jeff.

2972
03:17:57,010 --> 03:17:58,110
That's so cute.

2973
03:18:00,190 --> 03:18:01,390
Oh, my God.

2974
03:18:01,510 --> 03:18:02,870
Look at him.

2975
03:18:03,930 --> 03:18:05,950
He's business, Jeff.

2976
03:18:12,290 --> 03:18:13,770
Don't worry, business, Jeff.

2977
03:18:14,390 --> 03:18:16,290
He has a very important meeting.

2978
03:18:16,310 --> 03:18:34,150
today don't not do not the shark is that what isn't that
what business is all about I heard trip clubs make majority

2979
03:18:34,150 --> 03:18:46,570
of their money from from bachelor parties and business I'm
just I'm just role-playing they should have never given you

2980
03:18:46,570 --> 03:18:53,670
guys that evoke permission from the boss to throw it back

2981
03:18:57,930 --> 03:19:13,450
yeah that's how they do the business isn't it he ruined the
cuteness he could move that's he stayed it's a look it's not

2982
03:19:13,450 --> 03:19:17,670
like a one person thing It's a two-person thing.

2983
03:19:18,050 --> 03:19:20,650
He could have left, but he's still here.

2984
03:19:24,190 --> 03:19:26,850
It takes two to tango.

2985
03:19:29,070 --> 03:19:31,790
Leave that Jeff alone.

2986
03:19:34,090 --> 03:19:35,170
He's stayed.

2987
03:19:41,770 --> 03:19:42,410
Alright.

2988
03:19:43,310 --> 03:19:44,730
What do I feel like now?

2989
03:19:46,410 --> 03:19:47,730
You know what?

2990
03:19:47,810 --> 03:19:52,670
I worked so hard on Invisible and Invis, I don't play
Rocket.

2991
03:19:53,190 --> 03:19:56,990
Now I don't have, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go back to Zero
Effort.

2992
03:19:59,490 --> 03:20:00,570
That's how I deal with it.

2993
03:20:00,590 --> 03:20:04,810
If I feel like I work too hard, I just play Rocket to
balance things out.

2994
03:20:06,170 --> 03:20:07,790
So I can win with Zero Effort.

2995
03:20:09,970 --> 03:20:11,150
Let's brain empty time.

2996
03:20:11,230 --> 03:20:15,030
No, Rocket surprisingly meta now.

2997
03:20:16,730 --> 03:20:20,210
Can Please, I don't want to play Loki.

2998
03:20:20,430 --> 03:20:21,550
That's too much effort.

2999
03:20:27,410 --> 03:20:28,530
That's so much.

3000
03:20:28,610 --> 03:20:34,890
Yes, but it's like, I'm at the point of time where it's
like, I like winning a lot.

3001
03:20:35,470 --> 03:20:44,670
And like, if I get to win with the lowest amount of effort
to play, I'd go for it.

3002
03:20:48,190 --> 03:20:55,510
gonna make it harder for myself to win type deal because
like rocket is like the easiest support you can play in

3003
03:20:55,510 --> 03:21:00,530
general i mean we're going triple support so now i guess i
have to play mantis

3004
03:21:06,560 --> 03:21:18,200
really it is one of the it's one of the i think it's the
easiest support to play out of all of them oh are we running

3005
03:21:18,200 --> 03:21:22,540
gambit now or i thought he could he could what are we
running What?

3006
03:21:23,540 --> 03:21:25,360
What is this back and forth?

3007
03:21:28,640 --> 03:21:31,240
Someone figured this out.

3008
03:21:34,780 --> 03:21:37,000
What are we running?

3009
03:21:37,200 --> 03:21:38,000
What is this?

3010
03:21:38,820 --> 03:21:41,160
What is this back and forth that we're doing?

3011
03:21:44,460 --> 03:21:45,680
Me support player.

3012
03:21:48,800 --> 03:21:51,240
I can play any support.

3013
03:21:51,600 --> 03:21:51,940
I can't play any support.

3014
03:21:52,880 --> 03:21:55,320
Just no tank.

3015
03:21:59,460 --> 03:22:01,860
Can you gambit?

3016
03:22:04,260 --> 03:22:05,380
Give me gambit.

3017
03:22:05,700 --> 03:22:08,000
I don't want to gambit.

3018
03:22:09,020 --> 03:22:11,760
I don't want to.

3019
03:22:12,460 --> 03:22:13,780
I'm just going to get dove.

3020
03:22:16,100 --> 03:22:17,280
All right, here we go.

3021
03:22:18,600 --> 03:22:20,040
We fucking let...

3022
03:22:20,040 --> 03:22:20,860
Oh my god.

3023
03:22:21,220 --> 03:22:21,940
Oh, I'm so...

3024
03:22:21,940 --> 03:22:29,520
angry now because we let Gambit through because of that one
guy was like I can play Gambit so don't ban Gambit like what

3025
03:22:29,520 --> 03:22:42,540
was the point we could have banned Gambit this what the fuck
was the point we literally saved Gambit for that one guy and

3026
03:22:42,540 --> 03:22:53,300
he's not even I didn't want to play Gambit like we literally
did it for him Holy shit!

3027
03:22:53,380 --> 03:22:53,900
Are you see...

3028
03:22:53,900 --> 03:22:54,260
Okay, here.

3029
03:22:54,760 --> 03:22:54,980
I...

3030
03:22:54,980 --> 03:22:56,120
There you go.

3031
03:22:56,540 --> 03:22:57,780
I need to...

3032
03:22:57,780 --> 03:23:01,980
It would be good a bad gambit.

3033
03:23:04,980 --> 03:23:09,460
Yeah, like the guy that was like, I want to play gambit
isn't even playing gambit.

3034
03:23:09,700 --> 03:23:11,780
I did not consent to playing gambit.

3035
03:23:13,440 --> 03:23:15,640
I wanted to play rocket.

3036
03:23:19,760 --> 03:23:20,720
It's fine.

3037
03:23:21,940 --> 03:23:35,760
We are undefeatable There we go Why You come out I What do
you mean kid?

3038
03:23:36,420 --> 03:23:44,320
Okay, okay, okay, okay It's sort of, okay, I'll come in next
time But it's sort of basic knowledge That Gambit ult first

3039
03:23:44,320 --> 03:23:53,860
I I don't didn't think I needed to come then I just thought
In my head that Gambit builders always first, but I guess I

3040
03:23:53,860 --> 03:23:55,300
have to calm it now.

3041
03:23:55,920 --> 03:24:00,180
Like, why did you, why did I complain instantly?

3042
03:24:06,100 --> 03:24:08,720
Why is it up to me to calm that?

3043
03:24:10,980 --> 03:24:11,580
True.

3044
03:24:15,360 --> 03:24:16,560
I thought...

3045
03:24:16,560 --> 03:24:17,020
Alright.

3046
03:24:18,060 --> 03:24:31,900
I'm just surprised that it was up to me to be function to be
the one to calm that for us but oh well be calm what

3047
03:24:31,900 --> 03:24:43,340
happened to my little effort also yeah i ulted first i did
like i i don't know i did all first my alt was first yeah

3048
03:24:43,340 --> 03:24:51,480

confusing

3049
03:24:54,780 --> 03:24:57,300
Oh my god, I'm trying to help her.

3050
03:24:59,840 --> 03:25:00,660
I'm fine.

3051
03:25:01,120 --> 03:25:04,380
Oh, they were down two supports now.

3052
03:25:08,980 --> 03:25:09,860
That sucks.

3053
03:25:09,980 --> 03:25:11,140
I got full Dova.

3054
03:25:12,740 --> 03:25:14,500
I knew she wasn't gonna live.

3055
03:25:14,940 --> 03:25:16,400
I had to, like, leave her.

3056
03:25:17,020 --> 03:25:20,180
I was like, I had to leave her, but even then it was a risk.

3057
03:25:22,720 --> 03:25:25,240
But anyway, for those who don't know, usually...

3058
03:25:25,240 --> 03:25:26,760
This TP point, go group, magnet.

3059
03:25:27,260 --> 03:25:31,160
Usually, it is gamma first, no matter what.

3060
03:25:31,900 --> 03:25:33,840
You... that's how you rotate it.

3061
03:25:35,520 --> 03:25:37,440
That's why I was, like, so confused.

3062
03:25:37,600 --> 03:25:38,820
Ready, three, two, one.

3063
03:25:39,600 --> 03:25:39,920
Okay.

3064
03:25:41,000 --> 03:25:42,120
Alright, me first.

3065
03:25:43,320 --> 03:25:44,680
Go, go, brutal.

3066
03:25:48,000 --> 03:25:49,400
Oh, I'm not seeing this.

3067
03:25:51,200 --> 03:25:51,440
Nice.

3068
03:25:52,340 --> 03:25:53,420
There we go.

3069
03:25:54,080 --> 03:25:54,880
I separate.

3070
03:25:55,420 --> 03:25:55,900
Middle of the point.

3071
03:25:56,020 --> 03:25:56,440
Middle of the point.

3072
03:25:56,600 --> 03:25:57,420
That's where the eat's gonna be.

3073
03:25:58,180 --> 03:25:58,540
All right.

3074
03:25:59,140 --> 03:25:59,800
Not me.

3075
03:25:59,840 --> 03:26:00,660
I somehow got eaten by that.

3076
03:26:03,300 --> 03:26:04,080
It's just me.

3077
03:26:04,240 --> 03:26:04,620
You guys won't.

3078
03:26:05,300 --> 03:26:06,100
I swear.

3079
03:26:06,940 --> 03:26:07,740
Oh my god.

3080

They're said teleporter.

3084
03:26:11,740 --> 03:26:12,620
They're gonna teleport now.

3085
03:26:12,720 --> 03:26:12,840

3088
03:26:19,100 --> 03:26:20,000
When they drop down.

3089
03:26:21,520 --> 03:26:21,920
Okay.

3090
03:26:23,480 --> 03:26:25,180

3091
03:26:27,240 --> 03:26:28,180
Oh, I was gonna actually die.

3092
03:26:29,980 --> 03:26:31,680
All right, there you go.

3093
03:26:32,120 --> 03:26:33,180

Goodbye.

3098
03:26:40,520 --> 03:26:41,300

03:26:44,920 --> 03:26:45,900
And see, everything's fine.

3102
03:26:46,580 --> 03:26:48,760

I didn't need to calm.

3107
03:27:27,630 --> 03:27:28,910
He was doing a great job.

3108
03:27:29,250 --> 03:27:31,010
He was doing such a good job.

3109
03:27:31,470 --> 03:27:32,670
I didn't need to say anything.

3110
03:27:33,250 --> 03:27:34,830
I just need to say meal first.

3111

03:32:34,710 --> 03:32:36,450
You cannot have less damage than me.

3172
03:32:36,710 --> 03:32:38,130
Who's diving you?

3173
03:32:38,430 --> 03:32:44,830
Like, bro, I had Venom and Spiderman and Styler 24-7.

3197
03:36:20,640 --> 03:36:22,140
Bars, and FanFan.

3198
03:36:22,820 --> 03:36:23,320
What the fuck?

3199
03:36:23,440 --> 03:36:24,280
They get triple support.

3200
03:36:24,400 --> 03:36:24,560
Oh, wait.

3201
03:36:24,700 --> 03:36:25,160
We get triple.

3202
03:36:25,200 --> 03:36:25,960
Oh, my God.

3203
03:36:26,460 --> 03:36:28,320
He's forcing triple support.

3204
03:36:28,800 --> 03:36:28,800
What?

3205
03:36:33,080 --> 03:36:35,840
J3 is forcing triple support.

3206
03:36:36,500 --> 03:36:36,880
What?

3207
03:36:38,520 --> 03:36:40,280
I just realized.

3208
03:36:41,000 --> 03:36:41,860
I just realized.

3209
03:36:42,020 --> 03:36:44,300
This is a fucking triple support cop.

3210
03:36:44,600 --> 03:36:47,540
That's fucking hilarious, though, that, like...

3211
03:36:47,540 --> 03:36:49,300
Wait, did Mox ever do it with Kingsman?

3212
03:36:49,400 --> 03:36:52,240
That's, like, hilarious that Mox and Kingsman are on the
same team.

3213
03:36:52,720 --> 03:36:56,300
Yeah, because, like, there's three supports on each team.

3214
03:36:58,600 --> 03:37:01,280
Why did you force triple support?

3215
03:37:03,360 --> 03:37:06,680
They literally put three supports on each team.

3216
03:37:07,200 --> 03:37:08,920
It's not 2-2-2.

3217
03:37:10,960 --> 03:37:12,000
Oh, boy.

3218
03:37:12,020 --> 03:37:24,290
Yummy yummy triple support Yeah, because it's like wait we
don't even it's one two three we're playing triple support

3219
03:37:24,290 --> 03:37:33,550
and we don't even have two ticks Okay for those who don't
know I'm playing rocket not that not that but for those who

3220
03:37:33,550 --> 03:37:51,710
don't know Triple support comp is I want rocket I'm fucking
playing fuck you I the tab back in um so so the the meta for

3221
03:37:51,710 --> 03:38:00,850
triple support it has to be two one two one three it's two
tanks one dps three uh supports but he literally distributed

3222
03:38:00,850 --> 03:38:14,790
the players where there it's uh one tank two dps and three
supports i don't know how this is gonna go 30 seconds before

3223
03:38:14,790 --> 03:38:26,090
you attack get ready I want to play cloak because I wanted
little effort right now in this one game yeah for both teams

3224
03:38:26,090 --> 03:38:36,790
yeah because Bougar is a tank okay team team one my team
flats tank Craigie Day DPS Malaya Doki Lulu three supports

3225
03:38:36,790 --> 03:38:49,210
team two Bougar tank Moxie Moxie Kingsman DPS Rainbow Choco
bars fan fan For both these crazy

3226
03:38:54,690 --> 03:39:05,370
Oh my god We can't even not go triple support Oh I don't put
I don't put the I don't put it for any character Because

3227
03:39:05,370 --> 03:39:12,310
like I hate some of the characters Thing It's very
distracting sometimes Like especially for Luna I just turn

3228
03:39:12,310 --> 03:39:14,850
it out for everyone She has a Luna Disco shit.

3229
03:39:14,930 --> 03:39:16,530
I don't know when it's attack or damage.

3230
03:39:17,010 --> 03:39:18,230
It's so hard to see.

3231
03:39:19,010 --> 03:39:19,790
I think the.

3232
03:39:20,990 --> 03:39:21,350
Oh my god.

3233
03:39:21,450 --> 03:39:21,770
I thought that.

3234
03:39:21,910 --> 03:39:24,090
I didn't think he was going to get knocked up.

3235
03:39:29,670 --> 03:39:30,450
Probably here.

3236
03:39:31,090 --> 03:39:32,970
Yeah, I think her Disco.

3237
03:39:33,930 --> 03:39:36,830
The Luna Disco thing is so distracting.

3238
03:39:37,810 --> 03:39:38,290
In general.

3239
03:39:39,090 --> 03:39:40,810
Like I cannot tell which one is.

3240
03:39:40,990 --> 03:39:42,990
Which one is damage boost and which one is support.

3241
03:39:43,070 --> 03:39:43,470
So I just turn.

3242
03:39:43,490 --> 03:39:44,270
it out for everybody.

3243
03:39:45,430 --> 03:39:47,330
I think a lot of them are super distracting.

3244
03:39:47,570 --> 03:39:48,350
I'm fucking leaving.

3245
03:39:48,930 --> 03:39:49,390
Sayonara.

3246
03:39:50,350 --> 03:39:51,790
Oh my god.

3247
03:39:52,330 --> 03:39:54,470
He, they farmed a lot from us.

3248
03:39:54,750 --> 03:39:55,970
We do have a moon night.

3249
03:39:59,550 --> 03:40:01,310
I am ready to put on a show.

3250
03:40:01,970 --> 03:40:02,870
Oh my.

3251
03:40:03,690 --> 03:40:04,250
Oh.

3252
03:40:07,210 --> 03:40:08,010
Let's hope.

3253
03:40:08,510 --> 03:40:09,030
Do it.

3254
03:40:13,490 --> 03:40:17,490
I gotta grab this and then I...

3255
03:40:20,210 --> 03:40:21,630
Alright, do they have MAGA?

3256
03:40:21,970 --> 03:40:22,190
Nope!

3257
03:40:22,930 --> 03:40:23,510
We live!

3258
03:40:24,570 --> 03:40:28,450
I took a huge gamble, they're hoping that they did not have
MAGA.

3259
03:40:29,310 --> 03:40:31,970
Like, I hope they got...

3260
03:40:33,410 --> 03:40:35,230
Oh, he flew so fast.

3261
03:40:36,070 --> 03:40:37,570
Eh, you're fine, right?

3262
03:40:39,390 --> 03:40:42,050
Bro, that Luna is fucking crazy.

3263
03:40:44,130 --> 03:40:46,010
Oh, we did not need a used portal.

3264
03:40:46,190 --> 03:40:47,090
That was so winnable.

3265
03:40:47,810 --> 03:40:48,930
Yeah, I won the Gamba.

3266
03:40:49,250 --> 03:40:51,250
I was like, I hope they don't have Mega.

3267
03:40:51,710 --> 03:40:53,070
I don't know where to go.

3268
03:40:53,550 --> 03:40:54,710
I could have went to that cubby.

3269
03:40:56,930 --> 03:41:00,150
That's why J3 slam dunked me like 20 times.

3270
03:41:04,410 --> 03:41:06,750
I lost the Gamba every fucking time.

3271
03:41:06,930 --> 03:41:07,730
But hey, not last.

3272
03:41:07,870 --> 03:41:08,410
Third place.

3273
03:41:09,030 --> 03:41:09,750
Third place.

3274
03:41:10,910 --> 03:41:13,050
Was the lowest ranked player in the entire tournament.

3275
03:41:13,490 --> 03:41:21,850
place other captains told us that literally okay for those
who weren't who are new viewers literally other captains

3276
03:41:21,850 --> 03:41:32,410
were like we're saying my team was the worst team in the
entire tournament hey not last not last though didn't count

3277
03:41:32,410 --> 03:41:41,410
knocked out first might be the the lowest ranked That's it,
Kira!

3278
03:41:42,970 --> 03:41:44,530
Top three!

3279
03:41:47,750 --> 03:41:52,030
They're like, why did Doki pick these people on her team?

3280
03:41:52,510 --> 03:41:54,110
She's so stupid!

3281
03:41:55,430 --> 03:41:57,170
Still hollering?

3282
03:41:59,350 --> 03:42:02,390
Home... I'm leaving now.

3283
03:42:05,910 --> 03:42:11,070
Oh my god, he's going to use that and it's not going to be
on me.

3284
03:42:16,670 --> 03:42:17,150
Oh,

3285
03:42:26,720 --> 03:42:27,500
that's unlucky.

3286
03:42:27,720 --> 03:42:29,460
I don't know what to do about that.

3287
03:42:30,160 --> 03:42:31,340
Oh my god.

3288
03:42:39,170 --> 03:42:40,190
What the fuck?

3289
03:42:40,410 --> 03:42:41,310
That was a no-reg.

3290
03:42:42,610 --> 03:42:43,830
It's not a no rank.

3291
03:42:47,290 --> 03:42:50,770
Yeah, and I got knocked up by the champion team.

3292
03:42:51,310 --> 03:42:55,390
So technically second if you think about it.

3293
03:42:57,530 --> 03:42:59,590
It's technically second place.

3294
03:42:59,810 --> 03:43:03,810
All right.

3295
03:43:07,030 --> 03:43:07,770
That's fine.

3296
03:43:07,870 --> 03:43:10,110
You guys bunch up here and then blinded!

3297
03:43:10,270 --> 03:43:11,330
You're blind temporarily.

3298
03:43:12,810 --> 03:43:15,570
Jesus Christ, I hope you'll be alive after this.

3299
03:43:17,670 --> 03:43:18,690
No, he was not.

3300
03:43:18,810 --> 03:43:21,110
Wait, is this actual nectar or a role-play nectar?

3301
03:43:24,470 --> 03:43:27,050
We're gonna keep each other alive.

3302
03:43:31,010 --> 03:43:31,070
Alright.

3303
03:43:34,170 --> 03:43:35,030
Line it!

3304
03:43:35,150 --> 03:43:36,510
Oh my god, he was one.

3305
03:43:36,630 --> 03:43:37,390
I'm so sad.

3306
03:43:38,010 --> 03:43:38,210
No.

3307
03:43:39,210 --> 03:43:39,610
No.

3308
03:43:39,990 --> 03:43:40,710
Go, go, go!

3309
03:43:41,090 --> 03:43:41,250
Oh!

3310
03:43:44,070 --> 03:43:55,510
um oh man to be fair i had hope that he would really oh my
gosh okay

3311
03:43:58,810 --> 03:44:13,010

legitimately thought they would live i thought you know i i

3312
03:44:13,010 --> 03:44:20,870
could have kept my a little bit, but you know, we are
running one team.

3313
03:44:21,570 --> 03:44:23,270
Oh, I should have kept my all that to you.

3314
03:44:23,550 --> 03:44:25,530
That's a little silly of me.

3315
03:44:26,030 --> 03:44:29,290
Just a little silly of me.

3316
03:44:33,370 --> 03:44:35,610
Oh, I need to save it for it.

3317
03:44:35,830 --> 03:44:39,130
I have to save it for so many things.

3318
03:44:41,510 --> 03:44:43,210
I gotta save it for it.

3319
03:44:43,330 --> 03:44:43,630
Can I?

3320
03:44:44,190 --> 03:44:45,310
Okay, just in time.

3321
03:44:51,170 --> 03:44:51,790
There we go.

3322
03:44:54,650 --> 03:44:55,530
I have this.

3323
03:44:56,150 --> 03:44:57,350
There's Starlord ult.

3324
03:44:57,450 --> 03:44:58,670
There's Groot ult.

3325
03:44:59,050 --> 03:45:00,630
There's Magic ult.

3326
03:45:01,630 --> 03:45:03,130
There's too many ults.

3327
03:45:04,130 --> 03:45:05,570
They have too many combos.

3328
03:45:06,070 --> 03:45:07,050
Why did you go back?

3329
03:45:07,090 --> 03:45:08,350
You had a little cubby hook.

3330
03:45:09,010 --> 03:45:09,770
Oh my god.

3331
03:45:09,830 --> 03:45:11,070
You don't have to go back now.

3332
03:45:11,470 --> 03:45:13,290
You don't have to go back in now.

3333
03:45:13,410 --> 03:45:14,010
You already inserted.

3334
03:45:14,070 --> 03:45:14,850
too late.

3335
03:45:15,730 --> 03:45:17,130
It's already too late.

3336
03:45:18,290 --> 03:45:18,590
Please.

3337
03:45:20,850 --> 03:45:21,710
Oh no.

3338
03:45:23,210 --> 03:45:26,610
Oh, he's so stupid.

3339
03:45:29,990 --> 03:45:32,050
It's so stupid.

3340
03:45:33,610 --> 03:45:36,030
Were you all trying to off there, Groot?

3341
03:45:38,390 --> 03:45:39,550
Oh, fuck.

3342
03:45:41,090 --> 03:45:42,870
What the fuck?

3343
03:45:43,770 --> 03:45:45,330
Oh, Oh my god!

3344
03:45:46,470 --> 03:45:48,330
Okay, I'm gonna let my...

3345
03:45:48,330 --> 03:45:49,410
Oh, I cannot let him.

3346
03:45:49,550 --> 03:45:51,470
Alright, you have to save it for...

3347
03:45:51,470 --> 03:45:53,010
Please, you have to...

3348
03:45:53,010 --> 03:45:54,350
Please, you have...

3349
03:45:54,350 --> 03:45:55,330
Oh, no.

3350
03:45:57,250 --> 03:45:59,710
He has to save his rocket ult for Starlord.

3351
03:45:59,810 --> 03:46:02,250
If he is smart, he would save it for rocket ult.

3352
03:46:02,510 --> 03:46:05,430
If he is smart, he would save it for...

3353
03:46:05,430 --> 03:46:05,650
No.

3354
03:46:06,430 --> 03:46:06,710
No!

3355
03:46:10,570 --> 03:46:12,050
Please, we have... Okay.

3356
03:46:12,970 --> 03:46:14,030
That is good.

3357
03:46:14,070 --> 03:46:19,930
because, oh, that is not good.

3358
03:46:23,910 --> 03:46:24,910
It's...

3359
03:46:24,910 --> 03:46:27,650
You can expect too much.

3360
03:46:28,130 --> 03:46:31,130
Alright, so they do have Q to win right now.

3361
03:46:31,650 --> 03:46:32,350
From...

3362
03:46:32,350 --> 03:46:33,070
They...

3363
03:46:34,070 --> 03:46:34,570
They...

3364
03:46:34,950 --> 03:46:35,450
They...

3365
03:46:35,750 --> 03:46:43,890
They do have Q to win, which I am assuming is gonna be very
bad.

3366
03:46:44,830 --> 03:46:45,410
Oh,

3367
03:46:49,870 --> 03:46:50,530
there it is.

3368
03:46:51,510 --> 03:46:52,410
Oh, there it is.

3369
03:46:52,650 --> 03:46:53,410
Oh, they're so low.

3370
03:46:54,350 --> 03:46:55,870
They're so low, though.

3371
03:47:00,740 --> 03:47:01,780
I am.

3372
03:47:02,600 --> 03:47:03,440
Wait, they're running.

3373
03:47:03,640 --> 03:47:03,900
Oh, wait, no.

3374
03:47:04,700 --> 03:47:05,280
They're...

3375
03:47:05,280 --> 03:47:07,300
Is this actual next day or...

3376
03:47:08,660 --> 03:47:10,500
Or role play next day.

3377
03:47:11,820 --> 03:47:14,460
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

3378
03:47:15,200 --> 03:47:15,860
LARP guy.

3379
03:47:17,560 --> 03:47:29,040

3382
03:47:53,200 --> 03:48:04,500

worse this is technically a top 500 it's like technically uh

3383
03:48:04,500 --> 03:48:12,680
the tier but like a rank below top 500 also sleepy uh spots
thank you for the twitch prime then you think that's the

3384
03:48:12,680 --> 03:48:17,860
worst part that's That's the worst part.

3385
03:48:18,700 --> 03:48:19,220
Oh,

3386
03:48:23,700 --> 03:48:24,480

Oh, we're going- No, I don't go- I go- I go- Oh, this then.

We swap rolls.

3390
03:48:38,580 --> 03:48:39,500
Alright, here we go.

3391
03:48:40,360 --> 03:48:41,120
Let's go!

3392
03:48:46,340 --> 03:48:51,740
I mean, they don't technically They don't have anything
against me as Loki.

3393
03:48:52,680 --> 03:48:55,800
God damn, I just wanted to play a chill character.

3394
03:48:58,060 --> 03:49:05,000
I mean, never usable until they start saying slurs.

3395
03:49:08,220 --> 03:49:11,280
Until they start slings first and then maybe...

3396
03:49:18,950 --> 03:49:20,210
Ah, nice.

3397
03:49:20,350 --> 03:49:21,450
There is a group behind us.

3398
03:49:21,470 --> 03:49:34,810
us though see it in us and they start seeing gamer roots
then maybe it's usable I assume we can body block her oh she

03:49:59,110 --> 03:49:59,890
Apparently, yes.

3403
03:50:00,170 --> 03:50:01,770
The answer is yes.

3404
03:50:04,530 --> 03:50:11,290
The answer is, unfortunately, we are gonna let our cloak
just die.

3405
03:50:11,730 --> 03:50:11,830
I guess.

3406
03:50:12,810 --> 03:50:21,290
Okay, I want to copy my cloak early so I can use this.

3407
03:50:22,250 --> 03:50:40,410

3412
03:51:04,320 --> 03:51:05,940
Unfortunately not really.

Oh my god, I wanted to press F.

3414
03:51:08,540 --> 03:51:09,280
I forgot it.

3415
03:51:10,580 --> 03:51:11,720
That's unfortunate.

3416
03:51:12,740 --> 03:51:13,340
I mean.

3417
03:51:14,780 --> 03:51:15,500
That's...

3418
03:51:15,500 --> 03:51:16,460
Oh man.

3419
03:51:17,860 --> 03:51:18,820
Wasn't my fault.

3420
03:51:22,280 --> 03:51:23,620

3423
03:51:57,880 --> 03:51:58,600
That's all right.

3424
03:51:58,700 --> 03:51:59,660
My life don't matter.

3425
03:51:59,840 --> 03:52:00,840
I'm just a support.

3426
03:52:01,700 --> 03:52:03,180
What the fuck is he doing?

3427
03:52:07,480 --> 03:52:07,680
Eh.

3428
03:52:08,420 --> 03:52:08,960
I'll charge.

3429
03:52:10,900 --> 03:52:11,980
I'll take that.

3430
03:52:12,420 --> 03:52:14,000
What are they doing back there?

3431
03:52:14,360 --> 03:52:15,500
Oh, they're dead.

3432
03:52:16,760 --> 03:52:18,080
Oh, they got the res.

3433
03:52:19,560 --> 03:52:20,600
Is he gonna be okay?

3434
03:52:22,160 --> 03:52:22,860
Can't tell.

3435
03:52:23,740 --> 03:52:24,700
Oh my god.

3436
03:52:25,880 --> 03:52:26,600
The Iron Man.

3437
03:52:26,800 --> 03:52:28,600
I haven't seen Iron Man in so long, guys.

3438
03:52:29,120 --> 03:52:30,140
Does the lab...

3439
03:52:30,140 --> 03:52:32,120
Does the lab save me from Iron Man?

3440
03:52:32,640 --> 03:52:34,000
I actually am...

3441
03:52:34,000 --> 03:52:35,180
I actually don't remember.

3442
03:52:35,960 --> 03:52:37,740
The only reason is that...

3443
03:52:42,860 --> 03:52:44,260
Okay, he should live that.

3444
03:52:45,440 --> 03:52:48,880
I actually don't know because I haven't seen Iron Man in 20
years.

3445
03:52:49,820 --> 03:52:50,800
No, it does.

3446
03:52:50,860 --> 03:52:51,120
Okay.

3447
03:52:52,080 --> 03:52:53,000
I need a note.

3448
03:52:53,740 --> 03:52:55,340
Like, it's actually very important.

3449
03:52:55,660 --> 03:52:56,880
Because I don't remember.

3450
03:52:57,500 --> 03:53:00,140
I feel like Iron Man has not been meta for 20 season.

3451
03:53:00,820 --> 03:53:03,000
Alright, Lamps does not save you from Iron Man.

3452
03:53:03,180 --> 03:53:03,900
That's good to know.

3453
03:53:04,480 --> 03:53:05,720
That's actually very good to know.

3454
03:53:07,940 --> 03:53:08,800
Alright, I type.

3455
03:53:09,060 --> 03:53:10,220
You could...

3456
03:53:10,220 --> 03:53:11,240
Up first.

3457
03:53:11,700 --> 03:53:13,700
So he can bait the Magneto out.

3458
03:53:13,880 --> 03:53:14,720
And then I can chill.

3459
03:53:18,940 --> 03:53:19,420
Alright.

3460
03:53:19,880 --> 03:53:20,900
You're the baiter now.

3461
03:53:21,000 --> 03:53:21,420

sun.

3472
03:54:55,430 --> 03:54:58,230
I was like, oh my god, I can stab him.

3473
03:54:58,350 --> 03:54:59,850
He's so stabbable.

3474
03:55:00,790 --> 03:55:05,550
This giant tree is so stabbable right now.

3475

03:55:09,770 --> 03:55:12,610
That's on me, I'm sorry.

Can you really blame me though?

3478
03:55:17,010 --> 03:55:19,950
It was so stabbable.

3479
03:55:20,650 --> 03:55:23,410
It was literally right there.

3480
03:55:25,430 --> 03:55:27,110

Loki.

3499
03:58:25,820 --> 03:58:27,680
I just want to be a silly rat.

3500
03:58:30,560 --> 03:58:32,420
The amount of brain power.

3501
03:58:33,700 --> 03:58:37,300
Instead of hee hee.

3502
03:58:38,380 --> 03:58:39,060
Hee.

03:58:39,060 --> 03:58:39,380
Hee.

3504
03:58:40,760 --> 03:58:41,240
Hee.

3505
03:58:41,240 --> 03:58:41,320
Hee.

3506
03:58:42,700 --> 03:58:46,620
I had a cooking of... be aware of my goddamn...

3507
03:58:47,040 --> 03:58:48,860
Oh my god.

3508
03:58:59,530 --> 03:59:02,230
I'm going to use my lamp here.

3509
03:59:02,610 --> 03:59:05,970
I didn't know if people would be...

3510
03:59:05,970 --> 03:59:07,110
He's back!

3511
03:59:09,700 --> 03:59:12,200
Oh my god!

3512
03:59:13,880 --> 03:59:16,640
Why did no one turn around?

3513
03:59:20,440 --> 03:59:24,060
No one actually turned around.

3514
03:59:24,240 --> 03:59:25,180
That's crazy.

3515
03:59:25,940 --> 03:59:27,340
It was just me and Cloak.

3516
03:59:27,360 --> 03:59:28,760
Defending for ourselves.

3517
03:59:29,100 --> 03:59:32,320
How the fuck did no one turn around for us?

3518
03:59:32,960 --> 03:59:34,420
That's crazy

3519
03:59:41,790 --> 03:59:51,370
He literally came we literally just needed one DPS to turn
around and just shoot him because I have to spend my time

3520
03:59:51,370 --> 03:59:55,350
shooting Shooting my support.

3521
03:59:56,430 --> 04:00:04,090
Oh no, she used her bubble He's gonna jump one of us.

3522
04:00:04,670 --> 04:00:05,850
I don't know who.

3523
04:00:14,820 --> 04:00:16,560
Oh my god.

3524
04:00:16,860 --> 04:00:17,980
Oh my god, he turned around.

3525
04:00:18,700 --> 04:00:19,840
Oh my god!

3526
04:00:21,860 --> 04:00:22,800
He turned around!

3527
04:00:23,100 --> 04:00:24,720
See, that's all I need to do!

3528
04:00:26,340 --> 04:00:28,240
He actually turned.

3529
04:00:28,540 --> 04:00:31,880
He needed one DPS to turn around.

3530
04:00:33,560 --> 04:00:37,420
Time to switch things up, including which side you're on.

3531
04:00:37,620 --> 04:00:41,860
Yeah, oh, now he turns around when we lost the boy.

3532
04:00:43,500 --> 04:00:47,720
So they can feel it was just a choice.

3533
04:00:49,900 --> 04:00:52,540
It was just a choice not to.

3534
04:00:53,260 --> 04:00:59,100
I tried to give the benefit of doubt, maybe, you know,
because no one's talking that no one knew.

3535
04:00:59,920 --> 04:01:02,020
But it was just a choice.

3536
04:01:04,100 --> 04:01:06,900
They just decided not to.

3537
04:01:08,780 --> 04:01:10,000
They're like, fuck that.

3538
04:01:12,140 --> 04:01:13,900
If you wish.

3539
04:01:14,700 --> 04:01:17,400
What society can exist without lies?

3540
04:01:17,680 --> 04:01:18,400
Here we go.

3541
04:01:23,800 --> 04:01:24,520
Alright.

3542
04:01:25,260 --> 04:01:25,620
Alright.

3543
04:01:26,740 --> 04:01:28,680
I will be honest with you guys.

3544
04:01:29,340 --> 04:01:31,140
I don't know if this is winnable.

3545
04:01:33,240 --> 04:01:51,060
I believe this might be difficult because the venom
literally got two picks right off the bat on support I gotta

3546
04:01:51,060 --> 04:01:55,180
be real guys this does not look winnable

3547
04:01:58,260 --> 04:02:07,820
like the fact that their Iron Man has a bigger influence
fact is my moon night when moon night is like a lot more

3548
04:02:07,820 --> 04:02:09,040
meta right now

3549
04:02:14,990 --> 04:02:20,210
that's crazy for those who don't know moon night is
technically like more meta right now

3550
04:02:23,900 --> 04:02:30,000
all right all right we did it we got

3551
04:02:35,730 --> 04:02:48,890
oh my god i need to reload oh my god there you go Oh my god.

3552
04:02:50,970 --> 04:02:51,850
Oh, this is bad.

3553
04:02:52,330 --> 04:02:53,150
This is bad for me.

3554
04:02:54,530 --> 04:02:55,830
We don't have ults.

3555
04:02:59,780 --> 04:03:02,000
It's like they have two tanks or something.

3556
04:03:02,820 --> 04:03:04,020
The farm ults on.

3557
04:03:04,380 --> 04:03:05,660
It's actually crazy.

3558
04:03:06,100 --> 04:03:07,380
It's actually crazy.

3559
04:03:07,520 --> 04:03:09,400
It's like they have two tanks!

3560
04:03:09,740 --> 04:03:11,140
The farm ults off!

3561
04:03:17,770 --> 04:03:19,470
Oh my god.

3562
04:03:23,230 --> 04:03:28,350
You're like, it's like, I might not have your IP.

3563
04:03:29,790 --> 04:03:31,290
Yeah, no, it's because they have two teams.

3564
04:03:31,910 --> 04:03:33,750
The power of an ult battery.

3565
04:03:39,890 --> 04:03:41,110
Yo, 40.

3566
04:03:41,450 --> 04:03:44,450
Yo, but 45k damage on...

3567
04:03:44,450 --> 04:03:50,630
Yes, I wonder how their supports got so many support alts.

3568
04:03:50,890 --> 04:03:53,210
I wonder how...

3569
04:03:54,270 --> 04:03:55,030
Man!

3570
04:03:57,350 --> 04:04:03,510
Man, I wonder how did their support ult build so fast
compared to us.

3571
04:04:06,330 --> 04:04:07,990
That's so crazy.

3572
04:04:08,510 --> 04:04:10,170
Yeah, it truly is a mystery.

3573
04:04:10,490 --> 04:04:13,570
I'm a Moon Knight that did 45 King damage.

3574
04:04:14,490 --> 04:04:15,290
That's alright, I'm here.

3575
04:04:15,430 --> 04:04:16,970
Oh my god!

3576
04:04:18,670 --> 04:04:21,290
That's a big ass door!

3577
04:04:27,350 --> 04:04:30,870
Oh my god, that Thor is huge.

3578
04:04:31,910 --> 04:04:33,490
Wait, where is it?

3579
04:04:35,490 --> 04:04:40,610
Alright, hello Thor, would you like the holy ravioli?

3580
04:04:42,090 --> 04:04:43,310
Wait, what rank is he?

3581
04:04:44,030 --> 04:04:45,010
What rank is this guy?

3582
04:04:45,090 --> 04:04:47,110
Oh my god, the chef was like, no.

3583
04:04:49,010 --> 04:04:51,110
No, I got kicked by the bouncer!

3584
04:04:52,290 --> 04:04:52,690
No!

3585
04:04:54,570 --> 04:04:56,690
The bouncer kicked me out.

3586
04:05:01,770 --> 04:05:04,590
Oh shit, he's on the, he's on the chair now.

3587
04:05:05,310 --> 04:05:05,990
It's perfect.

3588
04:05:09,530 --> 04:05:12,790
Wait, I have to be like, I have to look this way.

3589
04:05:13,530 --> 04:05:14,830
No, I have to look this way.

3590
04:05:15,650 --> 04:05:16,890
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

3591
04:05:17,690 --> 04:05:18,890
I was your first buddy.

3592
04:05:21,650 --> 04:05:22,240
There we go.

3593
04:05:25,590 --> 04:05:26,510
I got...

3594
04:05:26,710 --> 04:05:27,110
area.

3595
04:05:27,970 --> 04:05:33,830
If only the other oh, I can watch this 1v1 duel as well
while we're doing this.

3596
04:05:39,200 --> 04:05:44,580
I can watch this sick ass 1v1 between that guy and the other
guy.

3597
04:05:46,340 --> 04:05:48,080
Throwing it back with my liege.

3598
04:05:53,500 --> 04:05:55,500
Alright, this is LG, guys.

3599
04:06:06,510 --> 04:06:07,390
Guys, LG.

3600
04:06:07,890 --> 04:06:09,850
Oh my god, forgot to avoid the guy.

3601
04:06:10,050 --> 04:06:10,630
Give me a sec.

3602
04:06:14,650 --> 04:06:18,350
If I get him on my team, I deserve it.

3603
04:06:18,950 --> 04:06:20,470
I deserve it.

3604
04:06:22,490 --> 04:06:23,690
He's on my team.

3605
04:06:25,170 --> 04:06:27,270
All right, now I have to play Rocket.

3606
04:06:27,790 --> 04:06:28,750
I'm going to get Water, too.

3607
04:06:28,790 --> 04:06:30,270
Oh, they do the bad phase.

3608
04:06:39,190 --> 04:06:41,470
Who am I going to banish from this match?

3609
04:07:32,780 --> 04:07:33,660
I am back.

3610
04:07:33,820 --> 04:07:35,920
They bent.

3611
04:07:39,400 --> 04:07:42,980
Please never go to a casino.

3612
04:07:48,780 --> 04:07:51,960
We did it even, Basilow!

3613
04:07:54,520 --> 04:07:57,920
We didn't even ask Loki.

3614
04:08:00,580 --> 04:08:02,280
Well, that's the big I'm already.

3615
04:08:03,940 --> 04:08:05,580
play low-key

3616
04:08:10,800 --> 04:08:24,280
Alright I literally just played low-key Oh my god We need a
second tank I swear to god if our moonlight was the guy I

3617
04:08:24,280 --> 04:08:30,880
did not avoid I swear to god Mantis do you play tank I swear
to god

3618
04:08:34,320 --> 04:08:35,820
I'm so weird.

3619
04:08:37,980 --> 04:08:38,440
Or DPS?

3620
04:08:38,740 --> 04:08:39,300
There ain't no trick.

3621
04:08:44,120 --> 04:08:46,020
Oh my god.

3622
04:08:48,020 --> 04:08:48,740
Oh my god.

3623
04:08:48,740 --> 04:08:49,540
Oh my god.

3624
04:08:49,620 --> 04:08:51,800
I just wanted to play the fucking rat.

3625
04:08:52,760 --> 04:08:54,140
I want her to chill.

3626
04:08:55,200 --> 04:08:56,560
I really did.

3627
04:09:01,820 --> 04:09:03,760
Guys, I have some bad news.

3628
04:09:05,580 --> 04:09:08,780
Hi, ran out of cough drops today.

3629
04:09:08,980 --> 04:09:13,380
I mean, we have three supports.

3630
04:09:14,220 --> 04:09:16,040
Alright, one of them, two of them down!

3631
04:09:16,840 --> 04:09:17,100
Wait!

3632
04:09:17,840 --> 04:09:21,000
Oh my god, oh my god, they're fucking running, Jeff.

3633
04:09:21,680 --> 04:09:22,740
A fucking course.

3634
04:09:24,420 --> 04:09:26,040
Oh my god.

3635
04:09:26,940 --> 04:09:27,800
They're running.

3636
04:09:28,080 --> 04:09:31,840
Oh my god, they have the better gambo.

3637
04:09:33,820 --> 04:09:48,840
big combo unfortunately their their comp on paper is a
better only because they have two tanks um they have two

3638
04:09:48,840 --> 04:10:02,780
tanks and they do have okay i did say on paper but like i
don't know it doesn't count for skill i guess It's because

3639
04:10:02,780 --> 04:10:07,420
they have Starlord and Starlord Gambit is so strong in
general.

3640
04:10:08,960 --> 04:10:10,640
It's very, very OP.

3641
04:10:12,920 --> 04:10:16,440
Man, if only we had a rocket to get that Riz off.

3642
04:10:20,650 --> 04:10:21,910
I leave.

3643
04:10:25,030 --> 04:10:26,390
Just in case.

3644
04:10:30,130 --> 04:10:31,390

Alright, oh shit, nice.

04:12:10,720 --> 04:12:12,780
Let's hope he doesn't die.

3655
04:12:14,360 --> 04:12:15,280
Oh, okay.

3656
04:12:16,280 --> 04:12:17,940
Maybe a little too early.

3657
04:12:18,560 --> 04:12:19,300
For sure.

3658
04:12:19,980 --> 04:12:24,180
I'm behind you.

3659
04:12:25,060 --> 04:12:25,420
Alright.

3660
04:12:31,090 --> 04:12:32,010
Goodbye.

3661
04:12:32,870 --> 04:12:34,330
I don't, I...

3662
04:12:34,330 --> 04:12:36,150
I legitimately...

3663
04:12:36,150 --> 04:12:38,050
You could tell that I...

3664
04:12:38,790 --> 04:12:41,230
I know that that rock was for me.

3665
04:12:41,410 --> 04:12:43,270
Like, guys, I knew instantly.

3666
04:12:43,430 --> 04:12:45,650
I was like, I'm not fucking...

3667
04:12:45,650 --> 04:12:47,070
Oh, I did not mean to do that.

3668
04:12:47,270 --> 04:12:48,150
I'd fucking...

3669
04:12:52,270 --> 04:12:53,230
I live.

3670
04:12:54,070 --> 04:12:55,330
I don't know how.

3671
04:12:55,790 --> 04:12:56,810
Never punished.

3672
04:12:58,910 --> 04:13:01,250
Never fucking punished, I guess.

3673
04:13:01,930 --> 04:13:02,310
Whoops.

3674
04:13:06,150 --> 04:13:08,830
That's why I don't push aggressively anymore.

3675
04:13:09,830 --> 04:13:13,140
All right, let's go.

3676
04:13:16,850 --> 04:13:17,130
Oh.

3677
04:13:18,990 --> 04:13:19,770
Okay.

3678
04:13:20,850 --> 04:13:21,210
Okay.

3679
04:13:22,230 --> 04:13:24,250
Like, chill, guys.

3680
04:13:27,070 --> 04:13:28,770
Come on, Maddie.

3681
04:13:31,130 --> 04:13:34,070
I don't know how the fuck I killed Maddie.

3682
04:13:35,150 --> 04:13:37,490
All right, Spotted.

3683
04:13:37,510 --> 04:13:38,450
You do your job.

3684
04:13:44,180 --> 04:13:46,040
I think they got the portal, guys.

3685
04:13:53,920 --> 04:13:54,980
Guys, I'm very scared.

3686
04:13:55,720 --> 04:13:57,240
I'm very scared, guys.

3687
04:14:00,660 --> 04:14:02,780
I think we need a portal, guys.

3688
04:14:04,640 --> 04:14:06,880
That sounds like real, but I think.

3689
04:14:06,880 --> 04:14:07,300
I'm dead.

3690
04:14:08,240 --> 04:14:08,600
Oh, my God.

3691
04:14:08,700 --> 04:14:09,400
Please kill me.

3692
04:14:10,060 --> 04:14:10,490
I'm going to...

3693
04:14:10,840 --> 04:14:12,340
I want a portal, but you guys can be touched.

3694
04:14:12,820 --> 04:14:13,760
I tried.

3695
04:14:14,760 --> 04:14:15,440
Someone is better.

3696
04:14:15,680 --> 04:14:16,360
I just started Portal.

3697
04:14:16,460 --> 04:14:17,120
I just started Portal.

3698
04:14:20,360 --> 04:14:22,540
It's like a 2-1-3.

3699
04:14:23,600 --> 04:14:25,060
Like I said, guys.

3700
04:14:25,920 --> 04:14:26,920
On paper.

3701
04:14:27,960 --> 04:14:30,900
Their comp is a lot better than my comp.

3702
04:14:31,440 --> 04:14:32,040
Also, Chamber.

3703
04:14:32,120 --> 04:14:33,000
Thank you for the tier one.

3704
04:14:33,200 --> 04:14:33,540
So thank you.

3705
04:14:33,620 --> 04:14:34,120
Thank you.

3706
04:14:34,320 --> 04:14:35,020
I feel like we need two tanks.

3707
04:14:35,500 --> 04:14:36,540
We don't have damage.

3708
04:14:37,600 --> 04:14:39,340
We don't do anything with just Spuddy.

3709
04:14:39,640 --> 04:14:40,160
Coffee.

3710
04:14:40,820 --> 04:14:42,880
The Spider-Man has a better KDA.

3711
04:14:43,560 --> 04:14:44,120
Look at.

3712
04:14:46,580 --> 04:14:47,060
Coffee!

3713
04:14:51,140 --> 04:14:52,960
Coffee, the Spider-Man is doing more.

3714
04:14:54,860 --> 04:14:57,220
You already, it's already over.

3715
04:14:59,880 --> 04:15:06,020
Oh no, the reason why we, it's because we lost the alt
rotation because our gamut didn't build alt in time.

3716
04:15:06,900 --> 04:15:09,760
I even like stopped healing to be like, you got this, you
got this buddy.

3717
04:15:10,020 --> 04:15:11,120
I'm not left clicking.

3718
04:15:11,880 --> 04:15:13,360
I feel like we just need to get our own.

3719
04:15:14,760 --> 04:15:17,260
look at me i'm not i'm not doing it

3720
04:15:21,160 --> 04:15:22,700

3732
04:16:43,110 --> 04:16:43,950
Like, oh my god.

3733
04:16:44,610 --> 04:16:46,330
Gavin never falls!

3734
04:16:47,950 --> 04:16:50,110
It truly never falls!

3735
04:16:54,850 --> 04:16:56,350
Oh my god!

3736
04:16:56,630 --> 04:16:59,310
Did someone say Gavin never falls?

3737
04:16:59,950 --> 04:17:02,270
Oh my god.

3738
04:17:07,550 --> 04:17:11,970
Holy fuck, I guess I did.

3739
04:17:12,650 --> 04:17:12,790
Oh.

3740
04:17:14,090 --> 04:17:16,250
We lost the alt rotation in the end.

3741
04:17:16,670 --> 04:17:17,330
We really did.

3742
04:17:20,150 --> 04:17:22,790
Oh, I hate this meta.

3743
04:17:23,310 --> 04:17:27,070
And the J3 gave us one, two, and three!

3744
04:17:28,610 --> 04:17:32,770
He put three supports on both teams!

3745
04:17:33,530 --> 04:17:35,570
We're in a show match!

3746
04:17:38,990 --> 04:17:45,210
Oh my god, it's literally whichever team rotates first.

3747
04:17:46,490 --> 04:17:47,510
Alright.

3748
04:17:50,570 --> 04:17:54,290

All right, I'm gonna let my Gambit heal, and then I'm just
gonna DPS here.

3754
04:18:12,560 --> 04:18:14,480
All right, I'm gonna put my nestle over here.

3755
04:18:15,280 --> 04:18:16,500
All right, Gambit heal.

3756
04:18:17,100 --> 04:18:19,360

Nice.

3762
04:18:28,700 --> 04:18:29,280
There we go.

3763
04:18:35,310 --> 04:18:37,530
Okay, I, this sucks.

3764
04:18:38,350 --> 04:18:39,070
I didn't do anything.

3765
04:18:43,430 --> 04:18:44,530
Oh my god, did I get it?

3766
04:18:44,970 --> 04:18:45,550
Oh my god, I got it.

3767
04:18:46,650 --> 04:18:47,510
This is it.

3768
04:18:58,770 --> 04:18:59,990
Oh my god, I have to get this.

3769
04:19:03,830 --> 04:19:04,710
There you go.

3770
04:19:06,650 --> 04:19:08,030
I couldn't find my gambit.

3771
04:19:08,210 --> 04:19:09,010
This was the closest.

3772
04:19:09,490 --> 04:19:10,430
This was the...

3773
04:19:11,110 --> 04:19:12,410
This is the closest.

3774
04:19:13,290 --> 04:19:14,850
I was like...

3775
04:19:14,850 --> 04:19:16,550
I was like, I can't find...

3776
04:19:16,550 --> 04:19:17,070
Fuck it.

3777
04:19:19,950 --> 04:19:20,990
This is the best.

3778
04:19:21,050 --> 04:19:21,750
I can do.

3779
04:19:22,410 --> 04:19:24,110
We have Gambit at home.

3780
04:19:24,830 --> 04:19:27,130
I am accused of loving chaos.

3781
04:19:27,930 --> 04:19:28,390
He just tried.

3782
04:19:28,410 --> 04:19:28,850
All right.

3783
04:19:29,370 --> 04:19:34,630
Let's see who has a better support alt rotation because this
is going to be a little rough.

3784
04:19:34,630 --> 04:19:36,670
I accept this minor improvement.

3785
04:19:39,430 --> 04:19:40,470
All right.

3786
04:19:44,090 --> 04:19:46,390
Let's try this out.

3787
04:19:46,870 --> 04:19:50,370
All right, here we go.

3788
04:19:51,810 --> 04:19:55,870
because I I don't know if I should have meant to I got a
little scared.

3789
04:19:56,630 --> 04:19:57,830
I got a little scared there.

3790
04:20:00,810 --> 04:20:06,050
I hope I hope that meant to that copy was not a throw.

3791
04:20:06,050 --> 04:20:08,450
Three, two, one.

3792
04:20:09,910 --> 04:20:11,790
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

3793
04:20:12,610 --> 04:20:12,710
Alright.

3794
04:20:16,190 --> 04:20:19,290
Because I did not know if we were gonna win that.

3795
04:20:20,290 --> 04:20:23,790
I was very It might have a Gambit, so we just farm for
Mantis here.

3796
04:20:27,230 --> 04:20:28,050
I'm just gonna...

3797
04:20:30,470 --> 04:20:31,990
I'm just gonna DPS then.

3798
04:20:32,110 --> 04:20:33,170
Ah, he went Namur.

3799
04:20:36,130 --> 04:20:37,530
Okay, just stay there.

3800
04:20:38,430 --> 04:20:39,790
Who the fuck was he?

3801
04:20:43,410 --> 04:20:43,970
Alright.

3802
04:20:45,490 --> 04:20:47,810
Nice, we waited to ensure that...

3803
04:20:48,570 --> 04:20:50,310
Oh, Gambit never fell soon!

3804
04:20:51,050 --> 04:20:52,630
And we don't have any ult.

3805
04:20:55,810 --> 04:20:57,930
Unless we get time to build all.

3806
04:20:58,070 --> 04:20:58,710
Okay, we still have time.

3807
04:20:58,810 --> 04:20:59,330
We still have time.

3808
04:20:59,470 --> 04:21:00,730
We have time to build all.

3809
04:21:01,430 --> 04:21:02,170
That's good.

3810
04:21:11,770 --> 04:21:12,050
Alright.

3811
04:21:12,350 --> 04:21:13,770
We still have time to build it.

3812
04:21:14,990 --> 04:21:18,030
They most likely will have Gambit ult.

3813
04:21:18,130 --> 04:21:19,770
So I am a little worried.

3814
04:21:20,670 --> 04:21:23,490
I'm going to try and let my other Gambit build it.

3815
04:21:28,910 --> 04:21:32,150
no oh no come on

3816
04:21:37,270 --> 04:21:53,770
not me oh maybe oh no maybe me oh my god this is it get it
get it get it get it get it get it get it yes Oh my god.

3817
04:21:55,010 --> 04:21:55,150
Oh,

3818
04:21:58,350 --> 04:21:59,410
that is awkward.

3819
04:22:00,830 --> 04:22:02,990
Oh, please.

3820
04:22:12,480 --> 04:22:12,720

04:25:40,500 --> 04:25:42,980
Mantis and me build so much faster than our Mantis.

3864
04:25:43,680 --> 04:25:45,580
This Mantis was crazy.

3865
04:25:45,800 --> 04:25:48,120
If he was acting, I will not be surprised.

3866
04:25:51,540 --> 04:25:54,740
like, he was very, his aim was crazy.

3867
04:25:55,760 --> 04:25:57,840
His aim was so good.

3868
04:25:58,600 --> 04:26:10,480
He was, he's like, bro, he has the same titles as her
fucking spider-man yeah that mantis aim was insane yeah she

3872
04:26:40,880 --> 04:26:47,360

knew of me and that he wanted a duo like i think like i've

3873
04:26:47,360 --> 04:26:53,780
never bumped into him in rank before other than today i
think just i usually play because he's like a college kid

3874
04:26:53,780 --> 04:27:04,000
right so he plays you know he he usually plays i usually
play in degenerate hours as in like i usually play at where

3875
04:27:04,000 --> 04:27:06,900
I pop up like at like 11 p.m.

3876
04:27:06,980 --> 04:27:15,220
and over um but today I was just like I want to I'm mad I
want to games were yeah games were pretty rough earlier

3877
04:27:15,220 --> 04:27:21,640
today so I was like I'm gonna stream because I'm mad uh yeah
and he plays on normal human hours so this is like the first

3878
04:27:21,640 --> 04:27:30,490
time I've ever bumped into Kingsman uh during rank hours so
um yeah GG's uh thank you everybody who came from the

3879
04:27:32,740 --> 04:27:38,840
Today's stream, if you're a new viewer here, I usually
stream on YouTube, so please check me out on YouTube.

3880
04:27:40,180 --> 04:27:46,000
And give me a subscribe, because I'm trying to hit a million
subscribers this year.

3881
04:27:46,980 --> 04:27:50,920
Anyone know whenever I stream on Twitch, please check me out
on Twitter.

3882
04:27:51,020 --> 04:27:57,020
I usually tweet out whenever I stream on Twitch, because
Twitch is where I do the spontaneous streams, or if I have a

3883
04:27:57,020 --> 04:28:00,600
sponsor here or anything, is where I stream here.

3884
04:28:02,740 --> 04:28:09,820
I have my merch store is down today this week because we're
going in some renovations on our merch store It'll be up

3885
04:28:09,820 --> 04:28:11,820
next week, but you're supporting me.

3886
04:28:12,160 --> 04:28:21,100
There are other stuff you can support me by with using my
code on Fortnite Fortnite gamer subs or EA.

3887
04:28:21,260 --> 04:28:26,660
I do have a dokeybird code for all three of those places Why
do I not stream on both?

3888
04:28:26,820 --> 04:28:28,480
Because I do not have two PCs.

3889
04:28:28,660 --> 04:28:30,220
I do not do dual stream.

3890
04:28:30,720 --> 04:28:36,740
I not do dual streaming for because I would get 50 frames
only because I don't have dual PCs.

3891
04:28:37,300 --> 04:28:43,160
I stream all of this on one PC and, you know, 100 frames is
doable, but 50 is not.

3892
04:28:44,600 --> 04:28:51,400
Last time we tried to do dual streaming with Rivalis, it was
like chugging along at 30 to 50 frames.

3893
04:28:51,760 --> 04:28:54,300
And I have a 5090, by the way.

3894
04:28:54,520 --> 04:29:00,880
I bought 5090 in a RAM before the surge pricing, before AI
became a big thing.

3895
04:29:02,740 --> 04:29:13,900
and I have a lot of and I have a 50-90 and I still get 30 to
50 frames if I do dual streaming of rivals.

3896
04:29:16,520 --> 04:29:19,500
Yeah, so that is why I just choose one platform.

3897
04:29:20,760 --> 04:29:23,460
Um, hey guys, thank you all for watching.

3898
04:29:23,740 --> 04:29:28,480

and move around and get that blood flowing.

3899
04:29:28,700 --> 04:29:32,020
