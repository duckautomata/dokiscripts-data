1
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,130
Oh, sorry.

2
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,130
Sorry for all the loops.

3
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,430
Oh, did I say loop?

4
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,450
What if we have a fifth loop?

5
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,850
Not a fifth loop.

6
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,470
Sorry, guys.

7
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:02,590
I am, like, trying to, like, mentally prepare myself for, um, the fight that I have to do.

8
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,950
Where past Doki has left me.

9
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:14,250
I realized what boss past Doki has left me with, which is apparently one of the harder bosses.

10
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:21,230
And, um, and also, I'm, like, okay, not gonna lie, I'm actually very socially drained right now.

11
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,010
I'm so... oh, my gosh.

12
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:30,130
All the back-to-back-to-back-to-back collabs I've done the last... I don't know.

13
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:36,910
The streak has been... it was a long streak of collabs, but, like, I am very... I am very, like, drained.

14
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,150
My social battery is so low now.

15
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:46,290
Um, yeah, I've been doing a lot the last X amount of weeks since...

16
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,570
Oh, since the beginning of July, I believe, right?

17
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,470
Wait, no, it was even before July.

18
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,310
Since, like, August.

19
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:58,250
I've been trying to keep up the streak, but, um, I am... I'm, like, running on fumes right now.

20
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:07,710
I had to... I was literally after the... after the Marvel sponsor, I was just, like, sitting at my desk, just staring at the wall.

21
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,930
I was so tired.

22
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,550
I... I was so... I was so tired.

23
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,110
Um...

24
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,010
Because of that.

25
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,130
And, like, tomorrow, I also have another sponsor.

26
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,050
I have another sponsor tomorrow.

27
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,210
Uh... Oh, wait, August is after July.

28
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,530
What?

29
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,230
I mean, June.

30
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,790
Since before June.

31
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,090
Today's August!

32
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,270
Oh, my gosh!

33
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:28,690
Fuck!

34
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,670
Okay, I... I told you guys, my brain is not okay right now.

35
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,910
I'm super fucking fried right now.

36
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:40,750
And then since June, I've been collabing, like, with someone at least once a week.

37
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:47,050
And, um, if you guys didn't know, I am an introvert, and I do need time to charge up my social battery.

38
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,910
But I have not had that time to charge at all.

39
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,250
So, I'm just... I'm, like, my... I...

40
00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:01,490
To be fair, in the morning, I was telling my manager, in the morning, um, my brain was so, like, overwhelmed when I woke up.

41
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,110
I didn't know why.

42
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,430
I was, like, when I woke up, I just felt, like, this overwhelming feeling.

43
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,190
Um, I think I was just tired.

44
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,930
I was very tired before the stream started, too.

45
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,950
I didn't want to say it on stream, because I was, like, okay, you're sponsored, Doki.

46
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,390
And, like, the Marvel Rival does always treat you so good, so you got...

47
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,730
Put on your game face, Doki!

48
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:25,090
Uh, but I was so tired, um, before the stream started.

49
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:35,330
Um, and, uh, um, and tomorrow, I actually have, uh, have another sponsored collab stream.

50
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,410
Wait, what's this?

51
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,190
What's this over here?

52
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,990
Uh, uh, oh, okay, sorry.

53
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:49,170
I got, like, a text message being, like, remember to give dad his vaccine.

54
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,310
His vaccine's rent, uh, is expiring.

55
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,770
Um, because I was, like, your dog's health is important.

56
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,930
I was, like, why?

57
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,930
I was, like, oh my god, what happened?

58
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,550
And then they're, like, oh, remember to update your vaccine?

59
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,170
I was, like, what happened?

60
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,950
Because he's at a dog center right now.

61
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,710
So, I got baited to look at the text.

62
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,670
But it was literally, like, my, my family...

63
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,410
My, sorry, not family.

64
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,450
I mean, dad is family.

65
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,650
My, my main vet being, like, you gotta make sure that he updates his vaccine.

66
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,070
I was, like, okay.

67
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,210
Um, um, but what I was saying.

68
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:21,590
Oh, yeah.

69
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,810
But, yeah, tomorrow, it's another sponsored stream that's on Twitch.

70
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,990
Um, and it's for Fake Trigger.

71
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,710
Um, so, we're gonna be playing that.

72
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,130
That's gonna be another tournament.

73
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,290
Um, it's, like, a third person.

74
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,010
It's basically, like, PUBG.

75
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,390
PUBG with anime girls.

76
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,070
And abilities, like, uh, Apex slash Valorant.

77
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,810
That's what Fake Trigger is.

78
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,130
So, if you guys ever, if you guys watch any of the gameplay of it.

79
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,350
Um, the rotations for Fake Trigger was basically, like, PUBG.

80
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,450
Where you get a car and then you rotate into, like, zone and positioning.

81
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,510
Yeah, it's Battle Royale.

82
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,430
So, and it's third person.

83
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:04,890
Um, um, and instead of, like, you know, uh, instead of, like, realistic graphics, it's anime girls.

84
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,690
Uh, so, that's gonna be on Twitch as well.

85
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,110
Uh, because of Twitch drops.

86
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,750
So, I look forward to that tomorrow.

87
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,410
Uh, sure, it's gonna be with Sure4, RPR, and Albert Lele.

88
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,370
So, we're on a team with Sure4 again for tomorrow.

89
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,750
Um, funny thing is that we were all, like, sponsored individually.

90
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,250
And then they grouped all of us together.

91
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:28,790
Um, so, we didn't, like, we didn't, like, uh, come together as a team.

92
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,090
As in, like, you know, one captain and then selected the rest.

93
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,570
It was literally, like, all four of us were, like, sponsored.

94
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,770
And then you just combine us together into one sponsored team.

95
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,510
Uh, uh, Karami, welcome to Tamiya Farm.

96
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,370
Welcome, welcome.

97
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,890
Uh, so, yeah, we're gonna be on group B.

98
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,730
So, apparently, it's, like, there's two groups playing.

99
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,590
But I chose the one at, uh, at a later time.

100
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,310
Because I don't want to wake up at 11 a.m.

101
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,730
Oh, wait, no, I have to wake up.

102
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,230
Fuck.

103
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,830
I have to wake up at 10 a.m.

104
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:57,890
for my cleaners.

105
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,430
Never mind.

106
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:10,130
I, I still have to, uh, I still, uh, have to, um, have to wake up early.

107
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,250
Because my cleaner's coming over tomorrow at 10 in the morning.

108
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:19,770
Um, but, yeah, my social battery is so, I'm, like, not, I don't want to say, I don't want to say burnt out.

109
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,670
I'm not really burnt out, per se.

110
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,190
I'm just very socially drained.

111
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:30,590
Um, but, so, next week, because I noticed, I've been, like, uh, I know, like, when I'm really tired.

112
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,910
When I'm, like, not as witty as I like to be.

113
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,970
In terms of, like, I'm not very quick with my responses.

114
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:42,330
Or, um, you know, bringing content and stuff.

115
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,450
Which I've been noticing.

116
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,290
Because, um, I notice when I need a break.

117
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:52,170
When, after the stream, I'd be, like, Oh, man, why didn't I say that?

118
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,730
Oh, that would have been such a funny joke to say.

119
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:55,690
Yeah.

120
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:01,290
Like, after the stream's over, I'd be, like, Oh, my God, I can't believe I didn't say that.

121
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,650
Um, so, that's, like, when I know, like, Oh, I need to rest up.

122
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:13,390
So, uh, because, like, after the Marvel Rival stream, I was, like, This was a joke that, like, literally came up.

123
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:20,870
You know how you're, like, uh, when, you know, like, uh, You're, like, with a group of people and they say something mean to you.

124
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,610
And you, like, be, like, okay.

125
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:29,810
And then, like, after you go home, you're, like, Yeah, well, uh, you're, You're, like, Oh, why did I say that back to her?

126
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,390
Jacob, welcome to Tomato Farm.

127
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,330
Welcome, welcome.

128
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,310
Yeah, you're, like, replaying your head.

129
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,870
You're, like, Oh, why did I say that back to her?

130
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,830
Oh, my God, That would've been such a good comeback.

131
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,950
Like, shit like that.

132
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,890
So that was me after my stream.

133
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,470
After my Marvel Vival stream.

134
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,430
And I was like, oh man, why didn't I feel that?

135
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,710
Why didn't I?

136
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,330
Yeah, I'm VOD reviewing my jokes.

137
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:53,770
Yeah.

138
00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:05,690
I'm looking back at the VOD and I'm like, oh man, at like 5 minutes and 33 seconds, if I said that, that would've been so much funnier and could've got a better reaction and then maybe I would've got clipped more.

139
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,490
Oh, why didn't I say that?

140
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,070
Okay, Jokey, remember this joke for next time.

141
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:15,630
Anyway, this is a joke that I wrote down because I wanted... from my VOD reviews.

142
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,710
Um, this was a really good joke that I wish I said, so I'm gonna say it now.

143
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,650
I know the timing is very off because we're not playing Marvel Rivals.

144
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:30,090
But you know how like, Luna Snow got like, another... Yes, I wrote it down!

145
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,150
Because I was like, aww, Doki, that was so clever.

146
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,290
I gotta write that down.

147
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,470
I'm running it back.

148
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,910
I'm running it play-by-play.

149
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,070
So like, you know, okay, so at like, at the beginning of the stream, okay, we're doing play-by-play.

150
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:55,830
At the beginning of the stream, you know how we were looking at Luna Snow and looking at the abilities that she, like all the buffs she's getting and we were like, oh man, she's so greedy.

151
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:04,870
I was like, aww, why did I say something like, you get, you're like, you're like, oh, um, when will you be happy, Luna players?

152
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:13,890
And then I would have been like, I won't be, I'll never be happy until I can kill the entire enemy team and 1v6 everybody.

153
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,670
And that would have been such a good joke.

154
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,310
I'll never be happy.

155
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:25,730
So clever.

156
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:32,210
Okay, but I did see someone, um, they were talking about like the Loki, yes, please clap, guys.

157
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:44,870
Someone was saying how like, uh, Loki, the Loki lamps, uh, when you place it down, um, you can also, and you have a Mantis player, because you need a Mantis player to do the team-up with Loki.

158
00:14:44,870 --> 00:15:01,610
And, um, and you place down the Loki lamps, and you, uh, the lamps actually give everybody a damage boost, and then from there, uh, Mantis can actually stack her damage boost with Loki's damage boost, and then the guy, I think it was Boger, the Boger was like,

159
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,590
uh, that's great, now you can feel, now you can have 1% of Luna's power.

160
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:17,750
And I was like, oh, that's so true, Luna just gets everything, while every other support player is literally begging for scraps every season.

161
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,470
Luna's just like, like, the favorite child.

162
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:35,790
By doing a team-up with Loki, you can stack your damage boost with Loki Labs, and then you'll be just as strong as 1% of Luna Snow.

163
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,310
When Adam... you know how long it took Adam to get his first buff?

164
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,230
Like, three fucking updates.

165
00:15:49,670 --> 00:16:01,950
Alright, so, because... because I am feeling really tired lately, when I know, like, I'm running on fumes, I will be taking next week off.

166
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:16,130
So, next week, there will not... I don't know if there will be in streams, but I will be taking next week off, just because I am feeling like I'm running on fumes right now, and my social battery is very, very low.

167
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:22,320
That said, I am going to slow down on collabs.

168
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,130
I won't, like, stop collabs.

169
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:29,950
I might do it, like, every other week instead of every week, because, like, there's too many.

170
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:34,830
I've been interacting with so many people, and I'm tired.

171
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,870
I'm tired.

172
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,230
I wanna... I wanna do some more solo streams.

173
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,230
Um, so we're gonna change collabs.

174
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,310
I know we had a really good streak going, but...

175
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,190
my battery is dead right now, and I can't recharge it.

176
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,770
So we're gonna make it...

177
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,670
We're gonna do it every other week.

178
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:05,230
Anyway, it's time for Elden Ring, where Pastoki has left me in front of a boss room.

179
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,090
Yippee!

180
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,110
Yeah, I had a lot this week, too.

181
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,790
Like, this week was soooo fully booked.

182
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,050
Um...

183
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,550
Uh, at least, like, next...

184
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,770
Like, since I'm taking a break next week, I was actually supposed to have the...

185
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:29,010
The gold, gold, gold stream was actually supposed to be for next week.

186
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,030
But because I really wanted to take a break next week...

187
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:37,390
Like, I've been planning on taking a break next week since the start of, like, since, like, Sunday.

188
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,590
So I asked my manager if I could move it to this week.

189
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,990
But it may have been a little bit of a mistake because of, like, with...

190
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,990
I am overwhelming myself with a lot of stuff.

191
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,770
But at least tomorrow...

192
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:47,730
Not tomorrow.

193
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,450
At least next week I can rest up.

194
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,910
So I can fully recharge.

195
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,710
I don't know how long I'm gonna...

196
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,090
I don't know how long I'll be...

197
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:57,450
Uh...

198
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:57,910
Most likely...

199
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:58,910
At most...

200
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,910
It might be, like, four...

201
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,510
Three...

202
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,270
Like, four to five days.

203
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,470
Um...

204
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,530
But other than that...

205
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,030
Uh...

206
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,470
I won't be gone for too long.

207
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,650
So if you forget about me, I'll be very sad.

208
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,410
Uh...

209
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,410
I can't do anything about it!

210
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,030
But I'll be very sad.

211
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,650
You don't want me to be...

212
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,470
Oh, wow, Doki.

213
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,870
You're gonna guilt-trip your...

214
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,170
Yes.

215
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,030
What?

216
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,670
YES, I am!

217
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,030
AND?

218
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,010
WHAT?

219
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,690
What about it?

220
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:36,830
You...

221
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,850
You guilt-trip me ALL the time!

222
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,830
Why can't I guilt-trip you one time!

223
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,030
Stop being parasocial.

224
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:57,530
Just because I want guilt trip one time and then people would be like, wow, Joki, you're so parasocial.

225
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,610
Oh, just one... I can't have anything, can I?

226
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,770
Yeah, that's my streamer.

227
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,710
Yeah, it's just one time.

228
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,410
I never asked for anything.

229
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,810
I couldn't forget you if I wanted to.

230
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,090
Next scene, they give me the super chat.

231
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,370
Thank you, thank you.

232
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,390
That's right, I never asked for anything, guys.

233
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,250
Anyway, can you appraise this message?

234
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,970
After that, I never asked for nothing.

235
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,530
Anyway, please appraise this message.

236
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,550
And also, and also, alright, alright.

237
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,070
After this, I barely asked for anything.

238
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:48,350
Okay, guys, after this, and then also this too.

239
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,930
And also, and also, this message as well.

240
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,430
Anyway, I barely asked for nothing.

241
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,210
I barely asked for anything.

242
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,890
I don't know why people are calling me so demanding.

243
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,250
I barely asked for anything.

244
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,510
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

245
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,790
Thank you, thank you.

246
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,510
Dragoons, remember.

247
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,650
No help.

248
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,790
Mister, thank you for the super chat.

249
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:21,550
Thank you, thank you.

250
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,550
Deal tripping us innocent dragoons.

251
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,930
Okay, that's it.

252
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,990
No help.

253
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,350
Alright, give me a sec.

254
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,010
Gotta fix.

255
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,290
Make sure.

256
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,650
Alright, here we go.

257
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,870
Alright, here we go.

258
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,490
I'm still not mentally prepared for this fight, not gonna lie.

259
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,510
I am still not... Oh wait, how do I...

260
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,450
Distant death.

261
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,190
Oh my god, he's coming straight at me, isn't he?

262
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:50,710
Oh!

263
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,670
Oh my god!

264
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,690
Okay, he is.

265
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,850
Okay, I'm panic rolling, but that's okay.

266
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,010
That is not okay.

267
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,230
I didn't remember how to play this game.

268
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,290
Okay.

269
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,630
Oh my god!

270
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,310
Guys, remember when I said I barely asked for nothing?

271
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:12,730
You know?

272
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,270
Wouldn't it be cool if I get, you know... Oh, I don't have my death counter.

273
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,770
Alright, give me a sec.

274
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,930
I'll put my death counter, uh...

275
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,310
After I beat the boss.

276
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,070
I...

277
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,610
So we'll never know how...

278
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,630
We'll never know how long it...

279
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,910
How many deaths I had.

280
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,510
Okay.

281
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,570
What the fuck?

282
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,850
Oh my god.

283
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:37,930
Okay.

284
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,710
I don't know how...

285
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,050
Alright.

286
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,190
That's fine.

287
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,790
Ooh, that is not fine.

288
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,370
Hit.

289
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,530
Holy fuck!

290
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,330
Excuse me?!

291
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,150
Alright.

292
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,390
This is not good.

293
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,210
This is actually not good.

294
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,410
Oh, he's poisoned.

295
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:56,990
Wait, that's good.

296
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,730
I don't know any of his movesets, though, to be fair.

297
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,510
I don't know any...

298
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,050
Oh, shit!

299
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:05,390
I'm dead.

300
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,030
I'm dead.

301
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,370
Guys, appraise this message.

302
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,450
Appraise this message.

303
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,930
Guys, it would be so funny if I get, like, one tiny appraisal.

304
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,530
That would be so silly, right?

305
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,350
Oh, okay.

306
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,650
Now I got the...

307
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,400
That would be so silly.

308
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,580
Just like a tiny crumb.

309
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,550
Alright.

310
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,090
What's he gonna do?

311
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,810
Snaz, thank you for the super chat.

312
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,150
Thank you.

313
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,750
Thank you.

314
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:38,090
Since we'll be taking a break during my birthday, may I please get an early happy birthday wish?

315
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:38,690
Joki?

316
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,750
I'm glad I lived to a quarter century old while watching you.

317
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,330
Of course!

318
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,290
Happy birthday.

319
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,710
Are you gonna praise my message, though?

320
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,490
Joki, I can't believe it!

321
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,550
I keep paying you for that birthday message.

322
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:58,210
And then you're still asking for a happy birthday to you.

323
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,090
Happy birthday to you.

324
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,990
Happy birthday, dear Snaz.

325
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,570
Happy birthday to you.

326
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,190
Yay!

327
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,590
Joki, this is extortion.

328
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:11,790
That's right!

329
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,270
That's right!

330
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,090
I'm extorti...

331
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:14,730
I'm...

332
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,310
I'm falling back to extortion now.

333
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,630
That's right.

334
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,820
Alright.

335
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,540
Oh my gosh.

336
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,840
Wait, he's a furry.

337
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,760
Oh, shit.

338
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,480
Wait, you guys...

339
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,500
Oh my god.

340
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,640
You guys appraised it.

341
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,740
Oh my god!

342
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,580
Excuse me!

343
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,440
Whoa!

344
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,040
What the fuck happened?

345
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,800
Wait, what happened?

346
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,080
I don't even know what happened!

347
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,920
Alright, so second phase seems to be really hard.

348
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,080
Alright, as expected.

349
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,240
Pastoki knew what was up.

350
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,620
I am not surprised.

351
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,760
Pastoki knew what was gonna happen.

352
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,940
Alright, at least I killed that horse, man.

353
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,380
Yeah, she was like...

354
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,060
Bye.

355
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:22,900
See ya.

356
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,080
Baby!

357
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,140
Thank you for the super chat.

358
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,480
Thank you.

359
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:25,980
Thank you.

360
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,200
Thank you.

361
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,020
Hope you had a...

362
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,720
Wait, do I have any runes?

363
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,560
I don't know.

364
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,320
Okay, good.

365
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,020
We go, Doki.

366
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,600
I love the gibbets you have.

367
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,360
I'm excited to get them.

368
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,480
Speaking of...

369
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,400
The Doki merch store.

370
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,300
Insert ad here.

371
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:36,700
Yes!

372
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,980
Uh, make sure to grab your items now!

373
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:47,000
Uh, we are planning on discontinuing, um, a few items after we get the extra stock in.

374
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,240
Uh...

375
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,240
Okay, let me get the...

376
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,980
Um, but even if you didn't make it to the original pre-order, we, um...

377
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,540
There is gonna be extra stock that will be, uh...

378
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,200
Oh, shit!

379
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,720
Okay, I'm already dead.

380
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,340
I'm already dead.

381
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,580
There will be extra items, um, for extra stock.

382
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,920
But then after it's gone, it's like gone.

383
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,640
We're not...

384
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,580
We haven't decided yet which one we're, um, discontinuing.

385
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,920
We haven't decided, though.

386
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,160
No death counter until I beat him!

387
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,180
That's right!

388
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,140
I'm holding the death counter hostage!

389
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,080
What if I just...

390
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,260
Okay.

391
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,680
Oh my god.

392
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,280
I don't even know, like...

393
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,460
God, I don't know his patterns well enough.

394
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,580
That's the issue.

395
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,760
Okay.

396
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,980
I feel like I have to play aggressive for this guy.

397
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,420
Okay, never mind.

398
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,340
Never mind!

399
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:55,960
Whoa!

400
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,940
Hey, guys!

401
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,660
I don't think I got a message of praise one time.

402
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,280
But, like, it...

403
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,700
You're just trying to head there, right?

404
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:04,660
Like...

405
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,620
Guys, this would be the perfect time!

406
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,400
Whoa!

407
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,060
The perfect time for that one message of praise, guys!

408
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,260
Wait, what?

409
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,120
Oh, he got poison.

410
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,140
No death counter!

411
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,360
No appraisals!

412
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,380
No death counter!

413
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,100
Who can play in that game?

414
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,220
Jesus Christ.

415
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,300
Yeah, I don't think my child's gonna live.

416
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,220
I don't think my child's gonna live.

417
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,020
Are you serious?

418
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,560
Oh my god!

419
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,100
What?

420
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,120
Am I on fire?

421
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,440
I think I have to be aggressive here, though.

422
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,340
Oh my god!

423
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:53,900
I don't...

424
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,700
I don't understand.

425
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:55,540
I...

426
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,380
Okay, there you go.

427
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,640
There we go.

428
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,200
See?

429
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,040
It's not that hard to do, guys.

430
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:00,940
Just...

431
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,540
Come on.

432
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,820
Just one appraisal.

433
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,600
All right.

434
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,540
How about a second appraisal?

435
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,980
Maybe three appraisals, too.

436
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,060
All right.

437
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,000
That was pretty sick.

438
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,200
I deserve an appraisal just for that one move.

439
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:15,560
I...

440
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,200
Just for all those dodges I did.

441
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,960
There we go.

442
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,760
That's right.

443
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,460
Okay.

444
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,440
I have to jump for that.

445
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,940
Oh, shit!

446
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,560
All right.

447
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,400
Oh, fuck.

448
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,120
Oh, fuck.

449
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:38,660
I'm...

450
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,260
I'm not okay.

451
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:39,980
I'm...

452
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,560
I noticed that when he does the floor thing, I have to jump.

453
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,020
Look at that.

454
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,240
I'm analyzing my situation.

455
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,960
I'm analyzing my environment, too.

456
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,800
Instructions unclear.

457
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,920
I appraised Malakith.

458
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:55,640
What's his name?

459
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,140
Is that his name?

460
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:56,760
Malakith?

461
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,860
All right.

462
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,740
Let's go.

463
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,780
Don't make me reset the counter!

464
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,060
Them will never know.

465
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,960
Don't make me reset it.

466
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,980
All right.

467
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,060
Come on.

468
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,400
Appraise me right now.

469
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,060
So I know we're all on the same page.

470
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,200
I asked for one thing.

471
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,380
This is the only time I've ever asked for anything.

472
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,060
Come on.

473
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:38,920
Come on.

474
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,300
The moment you appraise, I'll go through this door.

475
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,380
I need to know we're all on the same page here, dragoons.

476
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,260
This is a team effort, guys.

477
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,980
This is a team...

478
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,400
I got this far with this one build.

479
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,340
It's too late for me to do any other builds.

480
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,420
It's...

481
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,220
Come on.

482
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,460
Come on.

483
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,160
I can wait.

484
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,800
I can fucking wait.

485
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,480
You think I will wait?

486
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,160
I'm stubborn.

487
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,860
I'm just as stubborn as you guys.

488
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,140
That's right.

489
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,340
That's right.

490
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,520
I'm just as stubborn.

491
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,540
I could sit here all day.

492
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,860
I just need just one appraisal.

493
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,580
Now go in.

494
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,640
Come on.

495
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,100
What's the password?

496
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,880
Is this where my therapy session is?

497
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,680
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

498
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,000
Thank you.

499
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,440
Thank you.

500
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,340
You're only making this worse for you.

501
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,020
All right.

502
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,560
The next person that appraised me gets modded.

503
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,120
Here we go.

504
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,100
For the day though.

505
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,720
For the day.

506
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,380
The fine print.

507
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,160
For the day.

508
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:50,800
That's right.

509
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,220
The next person that appraised me gets to be mod for the day.

510
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,200
Do not fall for it.

511
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:00,940
Come on.

512
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,980
Jingle jiggle.

513
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:02,540
Whoa.

514
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,940
Jingle jiggle.

515
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,460
Well, you know you want to get that shiny mod badge.

516
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,480
Come on.

517
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,620
Jingle jiggle.

518
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,260
It's such a look in this.

519
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,360
The chat do reflect the stream.

520
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,060
Wow.

521
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,920
Thank you for the super chat.

522
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,300
Thank you.

523
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,060
Thank you.

524
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,520
You don't know why in it.

525
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,520
Make a new message.

526
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,020
No.

527
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,760
You come all the way over here and appraise it.

528
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:33,940
Oh yeah.

529
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,100
Maybe some people haven't killed the horse man.

530
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:36,560
No.

531
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,700
They should be good enough.

532
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,800
It's not.

533
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,660
I mean, it's not that bad.

534
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,960
You literally just run over here and appraise the message.

535
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,680
Hold the line.

536
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,500
Deathcat 136.

537
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,200
I stand against the Doki tyranny.

538
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,460
Sydney, thank you for the super chat.

539
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:01,960
Thank you.

540
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,620
Thank you.

541
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,260
All right.

542
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:03,640
I'll give.

543
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,420
I'll throw you guys a little bone right here.

544
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,520
See, I'm so...

545
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,740
I'm so ben...

546
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,440
Oh, there we go.

547
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:10,880
All right.

548
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:11,820
All right.

549
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,520
Well, it's too bad.

550
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,360
I'll never know who appraised that message.

551
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,480
Guess there's no mine.

552
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:21,800
Whoops.

553
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,320
Oops.

554
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,960
Oh, I just didn't think this through, guys.

555
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,960
Silly me.

556
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,060
Silly me, guys.

557
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,140
Oh, I'm such a silly, silly little girl.

558
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,820
Didn't think this through.

559
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,620
I'm so clumsy.

560
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,140
Haha.

561
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,620
All right.

562
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,580
We're all on the same page, at least.

563
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,820
Oh, darn.

564
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,380
Nope.

565
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,660
I guess I'll never know who to give the mod to.

566
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,100
You know?

567
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,020
So silly.

568
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,980
It's all right.

569
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:54,520
One...

570
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,700
Maybe one day I'll know.

571
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,660
Oh my god.

572
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,220
I think I'm dead.

573
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,580
I think I'm dead.

574
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,060
Wait.

575
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:10,740
Nice.

576
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,300
My child.

577
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,640
My child has distracted him for one more turn.

578
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,680
I live to tell the tip.

579
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,600
Oh, shit!

580
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,100
Never mind.

581
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,260
Never mind.

582
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,440
All right.

583
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,360
You know what?

584
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,020
I'm gonna be risky here.

585
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,880
Never mind.

586
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,600
Let me heal real quick.

587
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,200
Jesus Christ!

588
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,680
I didn't realize that was the move.

589
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,380
You know, I fucked up.

590
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,020
Forcing my way all the way here.

591
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,920
Just to get to the hardest boss.

592
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,800
And then you guys just stop appraising.

593
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:48,880
Like...

594
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,760
Maybe that was a mistake for sure.

595
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,100
I did not think this through.

596
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:58,700
I...

597
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,480
It's like you guys planned it or something.

598
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,040
It was just as planned.

599
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,600
I feel like you guys may or may not have planned that.

600
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,570
Oh my god.

601
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,350
Oh, I lived.

602
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:20,670
Okay.

603
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:21,730
Thank god.

604
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,190
What?

605
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,170
Oh, I didn't time to jump in.

606
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:27,490
Right.

607
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,270
Wait.

608
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:33,430
We've been on strike for three streams.

609
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:36,990
All right.

610
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,310
Clips, thank you for the super chat.

611
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:38,650
Thank you.

612
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,330
Thank you.

613
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,870
The influencer build is falling apart.

614
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:45,530
I...

615
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,330
I did not think this through.

616
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,190
I didn't realize...

617
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,170
I didn't realize people will just stop appraising.

618
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,070
I...

619
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,170
What's the point?

620
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:59,150
What's the point of being a content creator if I can't use my chat?

621
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,070
What?

622
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,750
What's the point?

623
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,070
Maddy, thank you for the super chat.

624
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:08,470
Thank you.

625
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,050
Thank you.

626
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,030
I'll remember this, you Oathbreaker.

627
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,190
You're weak-willed.

628
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:12,870
You'll come back.

629
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,070
He fell...

630
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,470
Fell for it again.

631
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,450
I can't believe he fell...

632
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,110
Jesus Christ.

633
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,710
How many times has he fell for it?

634
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,970
He's not right.

635
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:40,110
I can't believe it.

636
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,790
Not Rog.

637
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,190
Just Meti, though.

638
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:49,470
He's not right.

639
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:54,670
Where it goes to... Oh my... Oh my god!

640
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,290
I was sent to the air!

641
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,570
Siri, thank you for the super chat.

642
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,710
Thank you, thank you.

643
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,490
Uh, Doki poking us with a stick.

644
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,210
Like, come on, do some... Come on, guys!

645
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:09,770
Come on!

646
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:16,330
You see, Mehdi, I just have to do one thing and then you'll fall for it again.

647
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,270
Alright.

648
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:22,930
Head?

649
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,390
Here we go.

650
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,750
Alright, here we go.

651
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,290
What... You win it!

652
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,190
How about this, guys?

653
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,030
The moment we... The moment we beat him!

654
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:59,170
There might be a little jingle to that jingle, guys.

655
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,450
Hold fast!

656
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:11,490
Lies!

657
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,770
Dracos, don't listen to her!

658
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,150
It's a fade!

659
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,090
It's a fade!

660
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,890
Do not listen to her words!

661
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,250
Don't believe her lies!

662
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,930
Do not fall victim to the temptress!

663
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,790
It's like a siren call.

664
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:43,510
Do not drive your ship towards the rock!

665
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,290
No one word!

666
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,870
Trade offer!

667
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,940
Mehdi, gosh!

668
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,360
You said jingle jangle!

669
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,480
We need to...

670
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:00,760
A phrase!

671
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,880
Help me!

672
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,900
Thank you for the super chat, Mehdi!

673
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,300
Thank you!

674
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,080
Thank you!

675
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,980
And the fall for...

676
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,120
That he fell for it again award goes to...

677
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,080
Alright, I'm fo...

678
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm locking in.

679
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,320
Okay.

680
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,980
Sometimes like...

681
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,560
Oh my gosh!

682
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,140
Never mind!

683
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,340
I'm not locking in, guys!

684
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,840
I'm not locking in!

685
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,260
I need to like...

686
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,260
Figure out this pattern.

687
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,460
I know I'm trying to figure out...

688
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,440
Super late in...

689
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,380
Late in the game.

690
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,540
But like...

691
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,160
Sometimes I just have to...

692
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,600
Okay.

693
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,300
I have to jump for that.

694
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,580
Diamond!

695
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,860
He's in the mask!

696
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,900
Don't let him reach the message!

697
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:47,740
Johnny!

698
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
Thank you for the super chat!

699
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,320
Thank you!

700
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,040
Thank you!

701
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,060
Sorry!

702
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,520
Thank you for the super chat!

703
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:58,860
Thank you!

704
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,340
Thank you!

705
00:37:59,520 --> 00:37:59,920
Brothers!

706
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,620
Don't listen to the Tyrant's jingle jingles again!

707
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:06,940
Brothers!

708
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,320
Hold strong!

709
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:08,980
Brother!

710
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,140
Brother!

711
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,940
For the Emperor!

712
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,310
Alright.

713
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:23,550
Okay.

714
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,710
I mean, I feel like I'm...

715
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,330
The way I'm playing is correct.

716
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,970
I just need to be more...

717
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,890
I just need to know his...

718
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:34,850
Patterns better.

719
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,830
But I don't.

720
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:37,430
That's the thing.

721
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,670
I don't know his patterns.

722
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:41,910
Okay.

723
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,890
Don't worry.

724
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,290
My child will help me.

725
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,340
Okay.

726
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:53,840
Okay.

727
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,080
Alright.

728
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,020
Let's back up now.

729
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,400
Don't bargain with the witch.

730
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,020
Oh no.

731
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:05,740
Okay.

732
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,020
Nice.

733
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,470
No!

734
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:11,150
I couldn't!

735
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,390
I was stuck in the combo.

736
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,050
I was stuck in the combo.

737
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,370
Alright.

738
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:16,970
That's fine.

739
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,310
I think the...

740
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,770
Are you serious?!

741
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,430
He turns around?!

742
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,390
He wasn't even facing me!

743
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,390
Bro!

744
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,250
He wasn't even facing me!

745
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,870
Are you serious?!

746
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,610
Oh my god!

747
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,130
Okay.

748
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,630
This is actually bullshit.

749
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,330
Like...

750
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:45,610
Sometimes he doesn't even face me and hits me.

751
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,170
That's fucked up.

752
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,350
Sorry, child.

753
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,410
You gotta die for me.

754
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,310
I'm sorry.

755
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,550
I'm sorry!

756
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:59,070
For the sake of the greater good!

757
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,870
I'm the greater good.

758
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:03,850
Okay.

759
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,420
Okay.

760
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:09,440
What?

761
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,060
I still don't really know what...

762
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,260
What...

763
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,620
What is he doing?!

764
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,700
Okay.

765
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,040
Are you serious?!

766
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,900
Oh my god.

767
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,860
I don't know what he's doing.

768
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,280
I'm so fucked.

769
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,620
What?!

770
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:39,790
Okay.

771
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:40,870
Oh my god.

772
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,250
The stupid fucking roar!

773
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,010
Okay.

774
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:48,830
Alright.

775
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:54,360
No!

776
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,280
No!

777
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:55,460
No!

778
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,360
Oh my god.

779
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,360
Oh!

780
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:05,790
No!

781
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,310
Fuck!

782
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:07,490
No!

783
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,190
I don't know if I can get...

784
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:10,350
No!

785
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,350
I couldn't get inside!

786
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,330
It was too fast!

787
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,150
It was too fast!

788
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:19,150
Simple-minded.

789
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,390
Thank you for the super chat.

790
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,330
Thank you, thank you.

791
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,390
Remember when everyone...

792
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,070
When tyranny became law...

793
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,270
Rebelly becomes tyranny.

794
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,050
Don't give me...

795
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:27,330
Don't give me...

796
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,630
Negotiation time!

797
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:29,710
Parley!

798
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,050
Parley!

799
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,770
What do you fuckers want?

800
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:37,450
Alright!

801
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:38,770
Trade offer!

802
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:39,890
We're...

803
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,130
Let's go into negotiations!

804
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,190
What do you want?

805
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:44,670
To try good.

806
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,570
What...

807
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,070
Can I get...

808
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:51,210
What do you want so I can get my appraisals back?

809
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,570
Parley!

810
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:58,770
Parley!

811
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,470
We want...

812
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,570
Freedom!

813
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,510
Jesus...

814
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,370
Convo...

815
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:08,130
Nothing!

816
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:09,170
Alright!

817
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,590
Where's Jesus?

818
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,810
If Jesus shows up...

819
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,510
If Jesus shows up...

820
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,430
We'll talk.

821
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,610
Don't push it too much!

822
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:23,630
Don't push it too much!

823
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:31,610
Okay!

824
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:36,970
Nice!

825
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,140
Wait, does he not bleed?

826
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,900
Is he not...

827
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,800
Does he just not...

828
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,920
Blood or some shit?

829
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,680
Jesus Christ!

830
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,600
Okay, I'm just gonna back up, actually.

831
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,670
He does bleed?

832
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,090
Why isn't my bleed working?

833
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,310
Okay, oh my god.

834
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,390
This is my worst run.

835
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:10,950
For sure.

836
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,230
Oh my god!

837
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,430
Okay, I ran into that.

838
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,250
I thought I...

839
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,390
I thought I...

840
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:17,550
Uh...

841
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,110
Are you serious?!

842
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,630
I thought I rolled away too.

843
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:33,030
I thought I have a lot of bleed, but I guess not.

844
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:36,590
Okay, nice.

845
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,870
We got the second phase.

846
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,270
Are you...

847
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:45,510
Oh!

848
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:46,750
Oh!

849
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:48,850
Oh, I'm dead.

850
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:49,710
Oh, wait.

851
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:51,190
No, never mind.

852
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,860
Bye, child.

853
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,700
I'm sorry.

854
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,120
I'm sorry it had to be like that.

855
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,980
Oh my god!

856
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,700
I'm sorry to myself, I guess.

857
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,720
Oh my god!

858
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,900
I... Yeah, I was like...

859
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,100
Alright!

860
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,120
What is your...

861
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,620
What is your trade offer?

862
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,060
What is your trade offer?

863
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,100
What is your trade offer?

864
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,280
We want you to learn the fight.

865
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,900
Mr. Mike Fluffing Kings.

866
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,660
Thank you for the super chat.

867
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,860
Thank you, thank you.

868
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,360
Lord Kurosis.

869
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,360
What can you offer this dragon?

870
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,320
Thank you for the super chat.

871
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,680
Thank you, thank you.

872
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:44,990
Alright.

873
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,750
Jingle jangle plus Jesus combo.

874
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,870
How about this, guys.

875
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:58,050
If you stop giving me appraisal, I'll never bring the jingle jangle back.

876
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:05,450
That's my trade offer.

877
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,580
That's right.

878
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,040
I'll even show you all of me deleting it.

879
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,240
That's right.

880
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,900
It was a trap all along.

881
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,900
I know what you care about the most now.

882
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,540
That's right, that was your first mistake.

883
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,400
Never negotiate with terrorists.

884
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,160
Don't fall for it.

885
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,040
You know how- you think I won't do it?

886
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,460
I'm just as stubborn.

887
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,980
I know what you want.

888
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,580
I'ma be honest, I don't even care about that combo.

889
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,060
She owns the line.

890
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,740
She has no leverage.

891
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,180
She's getting desperate.

892
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,520
Please don't delete it.

893
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,040
You know what?

894
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,420
I'm gonna throw in something else.

895
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,600
I'm taking Doe Kitty out to the back, too.

896
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,480
That's right.

897
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,720
No!

898
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,620
That's right!

899
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,400
Doe Kitty will never come back if you stop the appraisals.

900
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:37,000
That's a- she's locked under- she's locked in the basement right now, jigsaw style.

901
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,200
The more you deny my appraisals, the closer the saw comes.

902
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:48,330
Do it then!

903
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:58,870
Oh, jesus.

904
00:46:59,010 --> 00:46:59,910
I need to remember that.

905
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,320
V-jesus!

906
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,840
Do what you want!

907
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,120
Not even jesus is on your side!

908
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,700
Okay.

909
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,060
I remember that.

910
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,660
Who the fuck- Let's do all this.

911
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,660
I'm gonna die here.

912
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,180
Oh wait, no.

913
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,100
Unless...

914
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,040
Alright.

915
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,240
At least he's poisoned.

916
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,440
I'm weak!

917
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,640
Oh shit!

918
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,140
Okay.

919
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,920
I didn't see that move.

920
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,380
Okay.

921
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,520
Alright.

922
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:54,950
Come on.

923
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:55,930
Okay.

924
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:56,670
Phase 2.

925
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,770
I hate that he does- he loses his, like, poison during phase 2.

926
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:02,670
So annoying.

927
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:04,410
Are you serious?!

928
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,170
That was- that was a dodge!

929
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:10,450
Oh my- that was a hundred percent a dodge.

930
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:11,970
That was bullshit.

931
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:15,250
Freak here, jesus.

932
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:19,050
Alright.

933
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:22,390
Where's he come- Oh my god!

934
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:23,670
I can't even see him!

935
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:27,350
This is actual bullshit.

936
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:29,670
This is- oh my god!

937
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:30,810
That was fucked up!

938
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,510
Look out of you windows!

939
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:43,210
That was just- That was rigged from the start!

940
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:46,610
I'm dead.

941
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:47,050
Oh!

942
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,290
Brr, thank you for the super chat!

943
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:53,190
Thank you- thank you!

944
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,770
You think you can intimidate us?

945
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:56,550
We've gotten used to the cutting board.

946
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,830
Being stuck with that forever- Or- that's it!

947
00:48:59,310 --> 00:48:59,970
That's it!

948
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,370
You don't- you think these were all just threats?

949
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:06,270
That's it!

950
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:10,870
That's looking it!

951
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:11,650
Where's my folder?

952
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:12,750
Where's Do-Kitty?

953
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:15,730
Where's Do-Kitty located?

954
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:18,670
I'll make sure Do-Kitty's first.

955
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,050
Alright.

956
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:23,390
Where is it?

957
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,990
You think I'm all talk?

958
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:33,030
You know I'm serious!

959
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:37,030
And they do not know what they do!

960
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,790
Many, thank you for the super chat!

961
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:40,490
Thank you!

962
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:41,390
Thank you!

963
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:42,870
Thank you!

964
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:44,630
Prospect!

965
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,510
Thank you for the super chat!

966
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:46,990
Thank you!

967
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:47,850
Thank you!

968
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:50,050
We're never appraising!

969
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,750
No more backseating ever again!

970
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:54,070
This is over!

971
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:56,310
Alan, thank you for the super chat!

972
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:56,690
Thank you!

973
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:57,330
Thank you!

974
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:58,070
Oh yeah?

975
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:01,050
You can get it- You can- you can save her!

976
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,690
You can literally save her right now!

977
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:07,630
Appraise this message right now!

978
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:09,170
And you can save her!

979
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:09,810
Okay!

980
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:10,750
You think I'm lying?

981
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:12,390
That's it!

982
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:14,610
Where's my- I found the folder!

983
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:16,710
Let me get the trash can too!

984
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:19,390
I'm grabbing the trash can too!

985
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:21,910
Alright!

986
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:23,490
Don't worry!

987
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:24,810
I'm moving it!

988
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,270
I'm moving it!

989
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:30,110
I'm heading to the trash can!

990
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:36,490
I'm not here to fuck around!

991
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,210
That's fucking right!

992
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,250
Go and stop!

993
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:43,530
Let's be reasonable!

994
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:45,750
That's right!

995
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:46,390
Delete!

996
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:48,690
And it's gone!

997
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:57,830
Take a- Take a pic of it!

998
00:50:58,750 --> 00:50:59,650
Okay, you know what?

999
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:00,430
I'm gonna take a screenshot!

1000
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:00,950
Alright!

1001
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:04,410
Alright!

1002
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:06,730
See that?

1003
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:07,230
Okay!

1004
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,110
And then, let me head to the trash can real fast!

1005
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:16,110
Heading to the trash can!

1006
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:17,670
You can stop this right now!

1007
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:19,310
If you appraise this message!

1008
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:20,970
This can all be over!

1009
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:27,710
You- You- You can stop this right now!

1010
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:33,130
Alright!

1011
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:37,350
Trash...

1012
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:38,950
Can...

1013
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:40,710
Wait, bin...

1014
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:41,450
Is it bin?

1015
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:42,470
What is it called?

1016
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:43,330
Is it just bin?

1017
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,990
Where is the trash can?

1018
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,130
I know where the trash can is!

1019
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:52,530
I was just trying to find it!

1020
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:58,090
Alright!

1021
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:05,850
Alright, I found it!

1022
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:06,350
Alright!

1023
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:09,590
This is where it is!

1024
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:10,890
Right here!

1025
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:16,450
Right here!

1026
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:19,350
There's DokiBirdCat!

1027
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,030
Right here!

1028
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,850
All you need to do!

1029
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:26,490
Is appraise...

1030
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,630
This mess- Appraise the message right now!

1031
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:32,190
Or she's gone forever!

1032
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:36,330
Paint used to be believable!

1033
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,770
That's right!

1034
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:47,030
If I don't get an appraise message...

1035
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:49,970
In...

1036
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:51,050
10 seconds!

1037
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,570
We'll never see DokiDi again!

1038
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:58,070
Do it!

1039
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:59,390
You would!

1040
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,390
10!

1041
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,770
9!

1042
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:09,510
8!

1043
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:11,890
7!

1044
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,210
6!

1045
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:16,810
5!

1046
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:18,990
4!

1047
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,970
There we go!

1048
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:36,980
C'ONG This is!

1049
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,440
Here we go!

1050
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,580
Oh my god, ok.

1051
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,220
Maybe even lower than 5 minutes.

1052
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:00,990
Alright.

1053
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,280
Come on.

1054
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:09,320
Ok.

1055
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,800
Jesus Christ.

1056
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,460
Oh, I'm dead.

1057
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,120
Oh, unless I live for one more hit.

1058
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:23,680
Who gave some random person?

1059
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,160
Another lost.

1060
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,360
Jesus.

1061
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,480
It does so much.

1062
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:42,980
I mean, this attempt is easier, but like... Oh my god, ok.

1063
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:43,860
Alright.

1064
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,060
Alright, I'm not dodging.

1065
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,760
JL, but Toki, I don't have L in ring.

1066
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,980
Thank you for the super chat.

1067
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,380
Thank you, thank you.

1068
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,720
It seems we have a Judas among us.

1069
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,900
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

1070
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,260
Thank you, thank you.

1071
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:13,470
Alright.

1072
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:16,990
Toki will live for two more minutes.

1073
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:27,430
And then, every appraisal... Every appraisal adds five more... No, you know, every appraisal adds two minutes to your life.

1074
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:30,450
Tik Tok.

1075
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:32,690
Tik Tok, Dragoons.

1076
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:41,290
Each appraisal adds two more minutes.

1077
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:47,450
I will... Or I will Thanos snap her away from... The Doki-verse.

1078
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,740
Every iteration of Doki-Ti will be gone.

1079
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:02,940
That's right.

1080
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,280
And I will do it.

1081
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,900
She'll cease to exist.

1082
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:09,800
That

1083
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:21,610
is a fucking clip.

1084
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:38,030
I will wipe Doki-Ti out of every Doki-verse.

1085
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,590
It's like she never existed.

1086
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:43,650
Don't fall for the bait.

1087
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:46,050
She needs Doki-Ti more than us.

1088
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:50,390
Mr. McFluffikens.

1089
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:51,630
Thank you for the super chat.

1090
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:52,810
Thank you, thank you.

1091
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,690
It's like she never existed.

1092
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:56,790
She bluffs.

1093
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,090
She's bluffing.

1094
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:00,270
Guys, stay strong.

1095
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:02,350
Tell us thank you for the super chat.

1096
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:03,570
Thank you, thank you.

1097
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:05,630
Oh, wait.

1098
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,410
I forgot to send out the jellyfish.

1099
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:15,050
And then, Kroki will be next.

1100
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:17,930
You think after Toki-Ti, I'll be done?

1101
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:19,610
No.

1102
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,730
Kroki- Kroki will be next, guys.

1103
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:29,410
Toki-Ti is only there to stop me from deleting Kroki.

1104
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:31,450
No!

1105
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,850
And then he'll cease to exist, too.

1106
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:38,630
Until every Doki from the Doki-verse is gone.

1107
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:40,810
And then it'll just be me.

1108
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:49,810
You monster!

1109
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:51,870
That's right.

1110
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:54,230
I'm holding every Doki hostage.

1111
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,350
I am Prime Doki.

1112
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:57,250
I can do that.

1113
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,700
I am Prime Doki.

1114
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,560
I have that power.

1115
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,300
How could you?

1116
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,020
Where's my appraisals?

1117
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,840
Where's my appraisals?

1118
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:24,880
Deleting Kroki is your least believable threat.

1119
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,720
Leah, thank you for the super chat.

1120
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:27,160
Thank you.

1121
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,880
Thank you.

1122
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:28,960
Sorry, guys.

1123
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,900
I can't let Kroki die.

1124
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,210
Alright, here we go.

1125
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:57,130
Do you think Doki Kroki will win your appraisals?

1126
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:00,910
Let it burn, Dragoons.

1127
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,030
Papa Smurf, thank you for the super chat.

1128
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:03,750
Oh, thank you.

1129
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:04,070
Thank you.

1130
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:06,750
Oh, I know what.

1131
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:07,550
I can...

1132
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:09,050
You know, I'll add one more thing.

1133
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:11,770
We'll never finish Elden Ring.

1134
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,430
That's right.

1135
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:19,970
You think this is over?

1136
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:24,770
I'll head to the last boss, and then I'll never finish the game.

1137
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:27,290
And then it'll be...

1138
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:29,090
We'll edge forever.

1139
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:30,290
Till...

1140
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:32,530
You monster!

1141
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:34,190
Oh, that's right.

1142
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:35,310
I knew.

1143
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,430
I knew it.

1144
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,610
Say thank you to Papa Smurf.

1145
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:40,070
I know what you...

1146
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:41,550
I know now.

1147
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:43,970
I know your weakness.

1148
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:48,010
Say thank you to Papa Smurf.

1149
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:57,020
Weak.

1150
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,940
Don't believe her lies.

1151
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:00,700
Oh, that's right.

1152
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,040
Oh, now the appraisals are flowing.

1153
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:05,820
That's right.

1154
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,880
And you know...

1155
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,980
You know if I wanted to, I won't complete a game.

1156
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,760
Oh, that's right.

1157
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,840
Now I know what you...

1158
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,400
What your weak point is.

1159
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,580
Now I know.

1160
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:28,060
I know.

1161
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:28,800
Boss.

1162
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,440
All right, here we go.

1163
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,200
Xanderman, thank you for the super chat.

1164
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,220
Thank you, thank you.

1165
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:40,700
The cherry...

1166
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,020
Yeah, the cherry gold never said to finish the game.

1167
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,100
I was gonna finish it.

1168
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:48,640
Just because I felt so kind and nice.

1169
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,680
But now I know.

1170
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,500
It was just seven bosses.

1171
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:00,460
I said seven bosses.

1172
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:08,550
All right, I'm not fighting Melania, bro.

1173
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:10,070
I'm not that fucked up.

1174
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:11,430
I'm not...

1175
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:12,850
I'm not that desperate.

1176
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:13,630
All right.

1177
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:29,530
All right.

1178
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:34,630
Guys, I'm not that desperate for appraisals, guys.

1179
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:35,250
I...

1180
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:38,590
I'm here for a good time.

1181
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:48,970
Man, they give us magenta soup, but thank you.

1182
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:49,610
Thank you.

1183
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:51,150
I'm disappointed, Dragoons.

1184
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:52,990
They're so weak to fall for your tricks.

1185
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:56,670
Why don't you ask your boy, Husky, to praise for him, hmm?

1186
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:57,950
That's right.

1187
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:59,730
I don't forget.

1188
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:01,070
Bro, that's...

1189
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:02,050
That's been...

1190
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,550
They've been holding this grudge for...

1191
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:06,410
For four streams now.

1192
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:08,910
Dragoons never forget.

1193
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:15,620
Oh my god.

1194
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:16,840
He's like...

1195
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,300
On...

1196
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,120
Okay.

1197
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,040
Oh, that's right.

1198
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:23,940
Yo, kid, he lives...

1199
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:25,400
A little longer.

1200
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,340
Jesus Christ.

1201
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,400
He's like doing...

1202
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,840
Okay, he's like actually doing bullshit moves now.

1203
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,080
He was not doing this before when I was fighting him.

1204
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:42,810
All right.

1205
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:46,010
Okay.

1206
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:52,580
And then...

1207
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:52,840
Oh!

1208
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,740
I mistimed that.

1209
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,200
I mistimed that.

1210
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:02,640
Oh.

1211
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:09,730
Brian, thank you for the super chat.

1212
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:10,170
Thank you.

1213
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:10,970
Thank you.

1214
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:14,210
Uh...

1215
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:19,210
The whole thing feels like a junkie using any trick up their sleeve to get their next hit.

1216
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:21,910
Go to appraisal rehab.

1217
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:24,250
Please, just one more appraisal, guys.

1218
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:25,410
Just one more message.

1219
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:26,590
And then we'll be good.

1220
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:27,570
We'll...

1221
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,530
We'll be good.

1222
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:34,050
77% done with downloading the game.

1223
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:35,910
That's right.

1224
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:41,310
You don't want me to just stop at the last boss.

1225
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:42,610
And then never...

1226
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,610
And then never complete it.

1227
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:49,490
I know you dragoons want me to see me complete the game.

1228
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:53,590
Okay.

1229
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:55,850
Oh my god.

1230
01:03:56,590 --> 01:04:00,270
Sometimes it's so hard to telegraph what the fuck he's trying to do.

1231
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:06,390
What the fuck?

1232
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:07,890
Okay.

1233
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:13,190
What the fuck?

1234
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:14,030
Okay.

1235
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:14,810
I'm just gonna...

1236
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,090
Take it a little bit slower.

1237
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:17,170
Fuck!

1238
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:21,190
Okay.

1239
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,050
Beat up my child a little bit so I can...

1240
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:25,010
In minecraft.

1241
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:25,630
In minecraft.

1242
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:29,650
Alright.

1243
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:34,680
What the fuck?

1244
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:35,920
Wait, how did that not hit me?

1245
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:37,280
Okay.

1246
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,400
That hits me, though.

1247
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:43,720
Jesus.

1248
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:47,950
Alright.

1249
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:52,030
Okay.

1250
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:52,630
Second phase.

1251
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:58,030
Are you serious?

1252
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:00,750
Okay.

1253
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:01,390
I'm just...

1254
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:02,050
Are you...

1255
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:02,850
Oh my god!

1256
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:03,330
Okay.

1257
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:05,070
Oh, that was close.

1258
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:05,810
Oh, I'm dead.

1259
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:06,170
Oh, I'm dead.

1260
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:06,550
It doesn't matter.

1261
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:07,150
I'm dead now.

1262
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:12,750
That hits me.

1263
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:14,090
Oh my god.

1264
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:18,210
Mom, thank you to the super chat.

1265
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:18,530
Thank you.

1266
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:19,090
Thank you.

1267
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:20,990
There's another boss close by that you could try.

1268
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:22,810
I might even give you an appraisal.

1269
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:25,050
Oh, the one appraisal.

1270
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:26,030
Oh my...

1271
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:26,710
Oh, please.

1272
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:27,550
I'm...

1273
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:28,650
Sir, I can't...

1274
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:31,350
Please, sir.

1275
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:33,750
I don't know if I deserve that one appraisal.

1276
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:36,970
After beating that one boss.

1277
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:39,830
Thank you to the super chat.

1278
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:40,190
Thank you.

1279
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:41,130
Thank you.

1280
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:09,220
Thank you.

1281
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,220
hehehehe.

1282
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,060
Hehehehe.

1283
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,460
Send them all...

1284
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:14,220
hehehehe.

1285
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,080
...

1286
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:17,280
Hehehe.

1287
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:17,720
Now,, general.

1288
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:20,620
Hehehe.

1289
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:24,940
Hehehehe.

1290
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:25,920
It's impossible!

1291
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,160
I don't care!

1292
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:29,100
Send them all!

1293
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,400
To the front lines!

1294
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:36,780
The Sire are true!

1295
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:47,940
Are you serious?

1296
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:48,700
Oh my god.

1297
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:59,380
Give me three hours, I'll make a new save!

1298
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:05,220
We're losing more men than we can produce Sire!

1299
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:12,020
I don't care!

1300
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:17,820
Keep... We'll lower the age!

1301
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:20,420
Send the children in now!

1302
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,400
We might as well!

1303
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,520
We'll even send the kids too!

1304
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:45,740
Oh my god, stupid roar.

1305
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:47,860
Sometimes he doesn't even do that.

1306
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:48,420
No.

1307
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:51,340
Oh my god, I forgot what that does.

1308
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:52,940
Are you serious?

1309
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,700
Oh, that's so fast!

1310
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,920
The kids yearn for the appraisals.

1311
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,720
Well, thank you for the super chat!

1312
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:03,700
Thank you, thank you!

1313
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,980
When do we get that moral boost or do we need more sacrifices?

1314
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:10,120
I don't know, I thought that's how it works!

1315
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:15,180
We sacrifice until there's nothing left!

1316
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,680
Only winners get moral boost!

1317
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:25,490
Alright.

1318
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:27,470
Here we go again.

1319
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:29,630
Here we go!

1320
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:31,070
Oh, I'm sorry!

1321
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:32,890
They don't have Elden Ring!

1322
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:35,730
Find them Elden Ring!

1323
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:43,290
Find their Steam name and gift them Elden Ring!

1324
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:47,410
We won't stop until this man is dead!

1325
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,840
Oh, I need to stop doing that.

1326
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:11,500
Not just the women and children, the elderly too!

1327
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,920
Buy your grandpa the Elden Ring!

1328
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:16,280
And your parents!

1329
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:17,960
And send them in!

1330
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:25,350
I can't.

1331
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:28,430
Please!

1332
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:32,850
Alright.

1333
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:37,700
Serious?

1334
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:46,160
The elderly, children, women, parents!

1335
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:47,480
I'll stop nothing!

1336
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,880
Give me all the appraisals!

1337
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,280
What?!

1338
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,960
Oh, I thought I rolled that.

1339
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,680
I thought I rolled that.

1340
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,000
Hold that line!

1341
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:08,900
Sydney, thank you for the super chat!

1342
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:09,960
Thank you, thank you!

1343
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,460
Alright, we go back.

1344
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,300
I'll smash my head against the wall until something happens.

1345
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:25,120
Surely by then, I'll learn.

1346
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,120
One day, Doki will learn.

1347
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:36,350
Alright, here I go.

1348
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:36,430
There we go.

1349
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:45,550
That's a souls player right there.

1350
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:51,580
Jesus.

1351
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,820
Oh my god!

1352
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,000
Okay, I didn't expect him to turn around, to be fair.

1353
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,440
This fucker.

1354
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:09,870
Oh my- okay, that's on me.

1355
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:11,030
No, that's on me.

1356
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:15,190
That hits me?!

1357
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:17,030
What the fuck is that range?!

1358
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,900
Oh my god, this range is bullshit.

1359
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:31,010
Okay.

1360
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:36,560
Alright.

1361
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,960
Oh my- I thought I could hide from below him.

1362
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,080
Cause sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

1363
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:47,100
Oh my god.

1364
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:47,820
Gotta get out.

1365
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:48,960
I got- NOOOOO!

1366
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,720
I couldn't run out of it!

1367
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:55,160
I just don't get hit, guys.

1368
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:04,550
I can't believe Pastoki did this to me.

1369
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:11,290
I can't- I can't- I can't believe- Pastoki.

1370
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:14,230
Can't believe she did this to me.

1371
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:19,990
She know- she knew what she did when she stopped right there at the door.

1372
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:29,070
She fucking knew what- what lies before this door.

1373
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,300
Are you serious?

1374
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,700
I thought I shot you- Oh my god!

1375
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:46,740
Of course he starts with that hit.

1376
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,420
This movement is so unpredictable.

1377
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:53,440
That's the worst part.

1378
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:55,920
Ah!

1379
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,100
I need- I'm trying to figure out how to time that.

1380
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:01,940
I mean, I could just jump it.

1381
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:03,640
I- I think I'm gonna try jumping it next time.

1382
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,780
Okay, I know that blocks.

1383
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,780
Wait, why is my jellyfish here?

1384
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:11,260
What the fuck?

1385
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:11,980
How did you get there?

1386
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:15,280
How- How did- How did- How did she TP here?

1387
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:20,320
Okay.

1388
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,840
I mean, he's stuck, at least.

1389
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:24,320
Nevermind.

1390
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,720
He's not stuck anymore.

1391
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:34,600
What?

1392
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:36,360
Okay.

1393
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:38,200
That should not have hit me.

1394
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:40,460
What?

1395
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:42,660
That should not have hit me.

1396
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:45,560
Oh my god.

1397
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,920
Hey guys, thank you for the super chat.

1398
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:53,780
Thank you, thank you.

1399
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:54,780
You wouldn't have to suffer.

1400
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:58,640
Just give us kitty and j- Jingle your jingles.

1401
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,560
Thank you for the super chat.

1402
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:01,300
Thank you, thank you.

1403
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:02,460
Alright, I'm locking in.

1404
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:02,980
Fuck this.

1405
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:03,960
I'm gonna lock in now.

1406
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:08,420
I'm locking in for real.

1407
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:11,520
I'm gonna- I'm- I'm gonna say that and I'm gonna die in one hit.

1408
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,920
But I'm- I swear to god, I'm locked in for real.

1409
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:17,320
Weak.

1410
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:20,300
Alright.

1411
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:27,000
And then after this, I'm ordering pizza.

1412
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:33,080
Maybe- Maybe ma- Oh no, pizza or mac and- No, mac and cheese.

1413
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,200
After this, I'm ordering mac and cheese.

1414
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:36,660
Doki deserves that.

1415
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,340
I'm gonna order.

1416
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,320
I'm gonna treat myself.

1417
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:55,370
Oh my god, of course.

1418
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:58,530
Are you serious?

1419
01:14:58,850 --> 01:15:01,790
Oh, it's like- It's so hard to see the pattern sometimes.

1420
01:15:04,830 --> 01:15:05,530
Alright, yes.

1421
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:06,750
Throw the rock at the child.

1422
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:08,190
Not me.

1423
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:12,190
That is-

1424
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:15,590
Nice.

1425
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:17,130
Alright.

1426
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:19,030
Woah.

1427
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,060
Okay.

1428
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:28,840
Nice.

1429
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,320
Oh my god, that should not hit me.

1430
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:34,960
But that's fine.

1431
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,520
Did I get hit?

1432
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:37,220
With that?

1433
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:39,240
Oh my god, I did.

1434
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:39,900
But it's okay.

1435
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,640
Oh my god, of course I get hit with that.

1436
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:50,480
Fucking of course.

1437
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:57,170
Eh.

1438
01:15:57,670 --> 01:15:58,150
It's fine.

1439
01:15:58,810 --> 01:15:59,690
That's not fine.

1440
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:00,310
That's not fine.

1441
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:01,050
That's not fine.

1442
01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:01,750
That's not fine.

1443
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:02,910
That's not fine.

1444
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:04,970
It no longer became fine.

1445
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:08,330
It no longer became fine.

1446
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:08,750
It no longer became fine, guys.

1447
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:11,550
Truly was not fine.

1448
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:12,230
What?

1449
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:16,330
Where did he come from?

1450
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:19,230
Holy shit!

1451
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:21,770
Okay, I didn't even know where that guy came from.

1452
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,840
Are you serious?

1453
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:29,540
Of course.

1454
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:31,920
Are you serious?

1455
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,220
Oh my god!

1456
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,220
Oh my god!

1457
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:42,840
The second phase is actually so bullshit.

1458
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:46,520
There was no longer five.

1459
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:55,440
All I'm saying is positive reinforcements goes further than negative.

1460
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,920
Thank you for the super chat random.

1461
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:58,340
Thank you.

1462
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,040
Thank you.

1463
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,440
Holy shit.

1464
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:06,960
His movesets are so fucking bullshit.

1465
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:15,120
This was why I stopped after that last play here.

1466
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,100
I knew.

1467
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,820
I knew what I had to face.

1468
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:24,980
Sire, we're running out of appraisals.

1469
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:27,100
The children, they're all gone.

1470
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:31,060
Lies!

1471
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,500
Get the women and the elderly involved.

1472
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:45,090
Okay, maybe we are running out of children.

1473
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:47,710
Make more children!

1474
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:50,410
The moment they come out of the womb!

1475
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:51,930
Give them the controller!

1476
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:54,190
And send them in!

1477
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:57,390
They already work.

1478
01:17:58,870 --> 01:17:59,030
They already work.

1479
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:03,050
Yes, Sire.

1480
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:08,850
Sire, make more children, dragoons!

1481
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:11,050
And give them the controller!

1482
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:13,150
The moment they're out.

1483
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,630
Guys, guys, guys, wait a bit.

1484
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:21,750
Wait a bit before you start appraising.

1485
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:24,330
I know you're very excited, guys.

1486
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:26,190
But I'm not even in...

1487
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:29,270
I'm not even in the fucking area yet.

1488
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:34,170
But Mint said stop.

1489
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:34,470
Okay.

1490
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:37,850
No, it's time to get pregnant, dragoons!

1491
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:41,050
Get pregnant and start appraising!

1492
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:49,030
Have more kids so they can play Elden Ring!

1493
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:57,250
All right.

1494
01:18:59,350 --> 01:19:00,650
That's the only way.

1495
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:03,870
That's right.

1496
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,240
Oh my god.

1497
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,320
He's so fast!

1498
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:27,520
Holy shit!

1499
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:30,200
He's so fast in general.

1500
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:34,120
There are two wolves inside you.

1501
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,660
One is telling you to get pregnant.

1502
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,360
The other is saying tell you not.

1503
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:49,860
One is telling you to get pregnant so she can survive in Elden Ring.

1504
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,080
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1505
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:53,280
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1506
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:02,360
All right.

1507
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,580
Here we go again.

1508
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,380
It's like my little groundhog day.

1509
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:06,400
It's...

1510
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,260
It's my little...

1511
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:09,720
It's my little...

1512
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:10,740
It's my little groundhog day.

1513
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,680
We start the day every day.

1514
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,620
For the rest of our lives.

1515
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:18,140
Until there's enough children to appraise me.

1516
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:21,660
And then have them subscribe to my channel anyway.

1517
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:23,140
Because, I mean, they're born anyway.

1518
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:23,680
Might as well.

1519
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:24,340
You know.

1520
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:25,840
Might as well.

1521
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:26,640
They're here anyway.

1522
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:30,300
Okay.

1523
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,120
This might be...

1524
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,200
I might have fucked up there.

1525
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,460
I definitely fucked up there.

1526
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:45,950
Oh, I don't like being down here though.

1527
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:51,260
Yeah, they're born anyway.

1528
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:51,840
Might as well.

1529
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:52,200
You know.

1530
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:53,880
Just a little extra subscription.

1531
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,920
Are you serious?

1532
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,320
Oh my god.

1533
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:03,140
I think my second attempt was actually my best attempt.

1534
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,040
Ha ha ha ha.

1535
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:07,260
Ha ha.

1536
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,000
Ha ha.

1537
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:09,340
Ha ha.

1538
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:14,940
My second attempt was the one I was most locked in.

1539
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:16,700
All right.

1540
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:16,960
Okay.

1541
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:17,160
Okay.

1542
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,160
I'm locking back in.

1543
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,260
I'm locking back in, guys.

1544
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:23,360
Right here.

1545
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:26,780
This is where...

1546
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,860
The victory appraisals.

1547
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,080
The pre-appraisals for victory.

1548
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:31,680
Right, guys?

1549
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,660
Ha ha ha.

1550
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,240
Like the pre-drinking.

1551
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,240
Before we go...

1552
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,180
We get...

1553
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:37,440
We go to the party.

1554
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,580
The pre-appraisals.

1555
01:21:45,490 --> 01:21:46,150
All right.

1556
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:46,710
Here we go.

1557
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,380
Oh my god.

1558
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:53,860
Okay.

1559
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:55,460
What?

1560
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:56,100
Okay.

1561
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,720
Sometimes he does like new shit and I'm not ready for that.

1562
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,120
I'm not...

1563
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,200
I don't want to be at the edge though.

1564
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:09,920
That's the thing.

1565
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,460
But I feel like there's nothing I can do...

1566
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:14,360
About it.

1567
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:18,540
Okay.

1568
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:24,600
I don't like how he fucking swaps Aragos here.

1569
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:26,180
This is so annoying.

1570
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:32,940
Oh my god.

1571
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:33,760
It's so annoying.

1572
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:34,680
I can't see!

1573
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,020
What do I do?

1574
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:43,620
I can't fucking see!

1575
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:46,940
Get out of there!

1576
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,060
Oh my god.

1577
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:54,520
This is the first time I died to that rock.

1578
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:01,220
All right.

1579
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:06,690
Stupid boss.

1580
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:08,810
I'm too dead anyway.

1581
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:11,110
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1582
01:23:16,410 --> 01:23:17,890
Goodbye, my child.

1583
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:21,390
Your death was actually pointless.

1584
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:24,890
Your death was so pointless.

1585
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:40,840
Oh my god, you fucker.

1586
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:46,280
Okay.

1587
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:49,780
Oh my god, you actual fucker!

1588
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:56,630
Oh my god.

1589
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:05,410
Some random person.

1590
01:24:05,690 --> 01:24:07,150
Thank you for the super chat.

1591
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:07,590
Thank you.

1592
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:08,250
Thank you.

1593
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:11,050
I called my ex to tell her to have her son appraised.

1594
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:13,630
All she said was, How do you keep getting my number?

1595
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:16,210
I changed 12 times already.

1596
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:17,890
Thank you for the super chat.

1597
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:18,490
Thank you.

1598
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:19,130
Thank you.

1599
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:21,950
Find him at his school and give him a controller.

1600
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:23,370
Ha ha ha ha!

1601
01:24:23,870 --> 01:24:25,190
Give him the steam deck!

1602
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:26,990
Ha ha ha ha!

1603
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:28,970
Surely that won't go wrong.

1604
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:36,210
You don't have a restraining order, right?

1605
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:37,990
Ha ha ha ha!

1606
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:38,290
No!

1607
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:41,050
Just for the day!

1608
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:43,690
This is clearly much more important.

1609
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:48,510
Not the steam deck.

1610
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:54,950
Why do I get like 7 appraisals before I get to the actual boss?

1611
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:57,130
And then 0 after that.

1612
01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:58,590
Dragoons, explain!

1613
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:08,660
I refuse to believe all of you were lagging.

1614
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:10,560
Ha ha ha ha!

1615
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:12,200
There we go.

1616
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:13,840
There we go.

1617
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,660
That's more like it.

1618
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,760
I don't think it's their update.

1619
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:20,440
I don't think it's their update.

1620
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:24,920
Again?

1621
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,240
Oh my god.

1622
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,100
How many are I- How many?

1623
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:37,510
Okay, remember when there was like 7 appraisals like going in?

1624
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:38,790
And then...

1625
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:45,640
I'm not like I'm confused.

1626
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,520
Just malicious compliance.

1627
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:52,760
Oh my god.

1628
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:53,420
Oh my god.

1629
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:56,800
It's been an hour and 30 minutes fighting this fucker.

1630
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:00,200
It was just lagged, though, kid.

1631
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:02,480
Ha ha ha ha!

1632
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:04,620
Just a little lag.

1633
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:10,800
Okay, I'm locked in.

1634
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:14,800
When I said I was locked in before, I was lying.

1635
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,500
I was lying.

1636
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:20,560
I was maybe like... I was only like 98% locked in.

1637
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:21,220
Now, I'm 99.

1638
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,180
Oh, I rolled that.

1639
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:47,840
Okay, sometimes I don't like it when I rolled it, but it didn't give me that roll.

1640
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:53,480
Oh, my God.

1641
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,860
How do I still not have the timing for this?

1642
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,620
How do I still... That's it.

1643
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:58,320
Just kill me.

1644
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:01,080
Check it.

1645
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,380
I'll just live for a little bit.

1646
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,100
Thought I got the timing.

1647
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:13,300
It's over.

1648
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:19,250
Oh, my God.

1649
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:21,910
The timing for that was so fucking...

1650
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:22,590
Ah!

1651
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:28,120
The timing.

1652
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:37,680
I need to be... Okay, now I'm like 99% locked in.

1653
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:40,020
Guys, sorry.

1654
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:41,000
I was lying before.

1655
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,360
I was only like 97% locked in.

1656
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,960
But now I'm 99% locked in.

1657
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,140
For real now.

1658
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:51,520
Alright.

1659
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,200
Here we go.

1660
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:54,600
Here we go.

1661
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:55,460
I got this.

1662
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:56,300
Come on, Doki.

1663
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:57,140
You got this.

1664
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,900
You first tried that other guy before.

1665
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:07,900
I think he has like... He just has like the weirdest fucking pattern.

1666
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:08,600
I feel.

1667
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,660
That's like what's throwing me off.

1668
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,940
His pattern is so fucking weird.

1669
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:13,820
In general.

1670
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:14,820
It's just...

1671
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:16,820
Like all his moves look the same.

1672
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,740
Or it's so fucking fast.

1673
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:24,680
I think that's what's like messing me up.

1674
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:30,190
I rolled in!

1675
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:35,890
I rolled in!

1676
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:45,450
It's just they all look the same.

1677
01:28:45,850 --> 01:28:48,210
Like every move he does looks like the...

1678
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:49,470
The same move.

1679
01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:55,190
I'll rate your messages like my bank account.

1680
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:56,050
Poor.

1681
01:28:56,690 --> 01:28:57,170
Aztec.

1682
01:28:57,230 --> 01:28:58,010
Thank you for the super chat.

1683
01:28:58,130 --> 01:28:58,370
Thank you.

1684
01:28:58,530 --> 01:28:59,070
Thank you.

1685
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:05,130
Alright.

1686
01:29:05,450 --> 01:29:05,990
This is fine.

1687
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:06,710
This is fine.

1688
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:07,750
I got this.

1689
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:12,640
Alright.

1690
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:14,940
I'm gonna focus.

1691
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:15,580
I'm focusing.

1692
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:16,140
I'm focusing.

1693
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:17,900
Alright.

1694
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:19,260
I'm gonna be serious mode.

1695
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:37,970
Serious?

1696
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:40,450
I'm actually serious mode now.

1697
01:29:41,370 --> 01:29:42,150
Like this guy.

1698
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:43,650
No more fun and games.

1699
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:45,570
I hate these pillars.

1700
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:14,500
This boss is actually pissing me off.

1701
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,520
Like legitimately.

1702
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:22,840
Oh!

1703
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:30,480
Oh my god.

1704
01:30:41,890 --> 01:30:43,010
Sorry, jellyfish.

1705
01:30:43,190 --> 01:30:44,130
It had to be that way.

1706
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:51,810
You poising him before you die, my child?

1707
01:30:52,150 --> 01:30:53,210
That's all I ask.

1708
01:30:57,610 --> 01:30:58,350
Thank you.

1709
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:02,840
Alright.

1710
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:07,700
Are you serious?

1711
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:08,800
Oh my god.

1712
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:12,920
Oh my god.

1713
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:13,160
Okay.

1714
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,800
I can't get a hit on him.

1715
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:18,020
The range is fucking terrible.

1716
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:24,320
Are you...

1717
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:24,540
I...

1718
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:24,760
I...

1719
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:25,260
I rolled.

1720
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:25,760
I rolled.

1721
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:26,640
I actually rolled.

1722
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:27,800
I rolled!

1723
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:32,500
Oh my god.

1724
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:35,080
I rolled too.

1725
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:39,460
Oh my god.

1726
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:41,780
I actually rolled.

1727
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:45,680
I have to not lock on in the second fight?

1728
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,780
Oh my god.

1729
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,400
Is that true?

1730
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:52,880
Is that the strat for him in phase two?

1731
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:57,280
Oh, I do?

1732
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,400
It helps?

1733
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:03,760
Okay.

1734
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:11,850
Okay.

1735
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:12,610
I'll try.

1736
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:13,350
I'll try.

1737
01:32:13,530 --> 01:32:14,670
I'll try a second fight.

1738
01:32:14,990 --> 01:32:15,570
Not...

1739
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:18,430
Uh...

1740
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:19,310
Not...

1741
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:20,450
Uh...

1742
01:32:20,750 --> 01:32:21,690
Not locking it.

1743
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:31,970
Oh, are you serious here?

1744
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:40,190
I'm backing up for that.

1745
01:32:40,650 --> 01:32:41,990
Like, fuck that move.

1746
01:32:42,950 --> 01:32:43,890
In general.

1747
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:46,370
Oh, he used that to distract me too.

1748
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:47,350
Fuck that fucker.

1749
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:50,030
I...

1750
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:55,970
I pressed it.

1751
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:56,650
I swear.

1752
01:32:56,850 --> 01:32:57,870
I swear to god.

1753
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:58,970
I pressed it.

1754
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:01,570
I swear to god.

1755
01:33:01,850 --> 01:33:02,030
Chat.

1756
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:06,330
Pain.

1757
01:33:07,070 --> 01:33:07,790
Pain.

1758
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:11,050
Guys, is he...

1759
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:11,430
Okay.

1760
01:33:11,770 --> 01:33:14,010
Out of all the bosses in the story.

1761
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:16,210
How hard is he?

1762
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:25,510
Out of all the bosses in the story.

1763
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:27,330
How hard is he?

1764
01:33:31,770 --> 01:33:33,870
In the story for Elden Ring.

1765
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:34,550
Chill.

1766
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:35,730
Welcome to Tomato Fire.

1767
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:36,530
Welcome, welcome.

1768
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:43,550
Like, am I fucked after I kill him?

1769
01:33:44,310 --> 01:33:44,620
Like...

1770
01:33:45,570 --> 01:33:46,910
Does it get worse?

1771
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:57,450
No, I need to know.

1772
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:58,470
Does it get worse?

1773
01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:02,310
Fuck.

1774
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:04,350
I'm gonna swim here here.

1775
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:05,550
I'm tanking it.

1776
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:12,780
Fuck.

1777
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:15,760
No.

1778
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:16,180
No.

1779
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:19,540
I thought he was gonna come to my jellyfish.

1780
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:25,000
Okay.

1781
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:38,090
Are you serious?

1782
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:40,230
Oh, no.

1783
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:41,190
Okay.

1784
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:42,290
Nice appraise.

1785
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:49,040
God.

1786
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:51,240
Oh, nice.

1787
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:52,120
Poison got him.

1788
01:34:56,910 --> 01:34:58,390
I hate it when he does that.

1789
01:34:58,570 --> 01:34:59,090
Fuck you.

1790
01:34:59,910 --> 01:35:00,850
Actual fuck you.

1791
01:35:02,890 --> 01:35:03,450
Okay.

1792
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:07,810
Goodbye, jellyfish.

1793
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:20,130
All right.

1794
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:22,090
Oh.

1795
01:35:24,910 --> 01:35:26,710
Oh, he's slowly walking up towards me.

1796
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:27,590
Guys, I'm so scared.

1797
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:29,670
He's just slowly walking up to me.

1798
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:30,470
Please do something.

1799
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:30,830
Please.

1800
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:32,550
Why are you just walking up to me?

1801
01:35:32,570 --> 01:35:33,650
Please just do something.

1802
01:35:33,910 --> 01:35:34,330
Please.

1803
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:37,650
I don't like that.

1804
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:38,730
Did you guys see?

1805
01:35:38,730 --> 01:35:39,730
He's just...

1806
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:42,390
He's so...

1807
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:42,630
Please.

1808
01:35:43,330 --> 01:35:44,490
Oh, my God.

1809
01:35:44,650 --> 01:35:46,190
Bro, that intimidation.

1810
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:47,790
Bro, he's just...

1811
01:35:47,790 --> 01:35:49,670
Okay, that threw me off.

1812
01:35:49,930 --> 01:35:51,070
That threw me off.

1813
01:35:51,070 --> 01:35:53,910
He's just slowly walking up towards me.

1814
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:55,310
Oh, my God.

1815
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:58,330
He's just walking there menacingly.

1816
01:35:58,770 --> 01:35:59,350
I got...

1817
01:35:59,350 --> 01:36:00,370
It threw me off.

1818
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:01,090
I was like, please.

1819
01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:02,270
Do something.

1820
01:36:05,410 --> 01:36:07,450
I was like, please.

1821
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:08,530
Do anything.

1822
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:09,650
Stop.

1823
01:36:12,670 --> 01:36:15,290
He aura farmed me.

1824
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:19,650
He made it be so hard.

1825
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:21,110
I was like, please.

1826
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:21,790
Please.

1827
01:36:21,970 --> 01:36:22,230
Please.

1828
01:36:22,570 --> 01:36:22,810
Stop.

1829
01:36:23,230 --> 01:36:24,630
Just do anything.

1830
01:36:25,090 --> 01:36:26,710
Just stop walking up to me.

1831
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:29,730
I lost the mental game.

1832
01:36:29,730 --> 01:36:30,590
I really did.

1833
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:37,640
I just didn't know what to do.

1834
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:44,100
Oh, my God.

1835
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:47,500
What?

1836
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:48,220
Okay.

1837
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:49,340
That was bullshit.

1838
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:50,740
Oh.

1839
01:36:58,140 --> 01:36:58,700
Okay.

1840
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:04,090
Oh, sometimes I can't see.

1841
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:10,420
Okay.

1842
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:14,540
Barry, welcome to the tomato farm.

1843
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:15,460
Welcome, welcome.

1844
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:19,960
All right.

1845
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:30,740
Hit.

1846
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:32,420
Okay.

1847
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:33,600
We got to...

1848
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:34,860
I'm just going to wait a little bit.

1849
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:38,900
Guys, if you guys want to do an appraisal right now, we have like a 10 second cooldown.

1850
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:40,260
A break time.

1851
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,240
So I can be full HP.

1852
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:44,040
I don't even know if I'm full HP, guys.

1853
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:44,940
Just...

1854
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:48,160
If you want to, you know, put in your appraisals right now.

1855
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:49,560
Right now is the time.

1856
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:51,260
All right.

1857
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:51,860
There you go.

1858
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:52,300
Nice.

1859
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:52,660
Okay.

1860
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:54,080
I'm full HP going in.

1861
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:54,680
Let's go.

1862
01:37:57,620 --> 01:37:59,760
I just want to make sure we hop.

1863
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:02,520
Okay.

1864
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:10,100
Yeah, I'm not dealing with that.

1865
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:12,480
Okay.

1866
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:18,390
Oh my god.

1867
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:19,130
Where is he?

1868
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:21,310
Oh, where is he?

1869
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:25,670
Okay.

1870
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:30,960
Really?

1871
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:33,540
Oh my god, Chrissy!

1872
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:37,040
Oh my god.

1873
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,360
I actually can't see that.

1874
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:43,310
Okay.

1875
01:38:57,620 --> 01:38:58,980
Oh, this was a bad idea.

1876
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:00,340
I knew that was a bad idea.

1877
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:02,160
I knew that was a bad idea!

1878
01:39:08,230 --> 01:39:08,630
Okay.

1879
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:15,640
Okay.

1880
01:39:20,810 --> 01:39:22,010
Oh, I'm backing out of that.

1881
01:39:23,170 --> 01:39:23,470
Yeah.

1882
01:39:26,410 --> 01:39:26,810
Oh.

1883
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:31,130
Are you serious?

1884
01:39:31,670 --> 01:39:32,150
No!

1885
01:39:34,810 --> 01:39:35,710
Oh my god.

1886
01:39:37,150 --> 01:39:38,410
Oh, holy shit.

1887
01:39:38,770 --> 01:39:39,930
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1888
01:39:40,710 --> 01:39:41,190
No!

1889
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:45,610
I don't know the timing for that because I just keep dodging it.

1890
01:39:57,380 --> 01:39:58,740
Ice is so fast.

1891
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:00,420
It's so fast.

1892
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:02,440
Oh my god.

1893
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,520
So fast.

1894
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:06,420
He's...

1895
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:07,740
Oh my god.

1896
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:10,500
It just doesn't stop.

1897
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:11,500
It never stops.

1898
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:12,580
It just keeps coming.

1899
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:13,780
And it just keeps coming.

1900
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:15,640
And it just keeps...

1901
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:16,060
Oh.

1902
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,260
It just keeps coming.

1903
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:21,860
It's like never ending.

1904
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:23,780
I'm like stuck in purgatory.

1905
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:26,940
Oh.

1906
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:32,740
Man, thank you for Magenta Supa.

1907
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:33,120
Thank you.

1908
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:33,640
Thank you.

1909
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:37,440
He goes from Beast Mode Clergy Man to Malkeep the Horrible.

1910
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:39,660
Thank you for the Magenta Supa.

1911
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:40,000
Thank you.

1912
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:40,440
Thank you.

1913
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:40,740
Forward.

1914
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:41,640
Thank you for the Super Chat.

1915
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:41,940
Thank you.

1916
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:42,380
Thank you.

1917
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:43,460
I need to hydrate.

1918
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:44,700
I haven't drank any water in a while.

1919
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:50,000
Alright.

1920
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:52,020
Oh.

1921
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:54,280
I'm here to pay my toll.

1922
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:58,220
For the boy's hurt.

1923
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:01,900
Oh my gosh.

1924
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:03,260
I stopped locking in.

1925
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:07,580
I'm in my happy place.

1926
01:41:08,420 --> 01:41:09,360
Right now.

1927
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:12,740
I stopped locking in, guys.

1928
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:13,940
I'm in my happy place.

1929
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:15,600
He can't hurt me.

1930
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:19,980
He can't hurt me when I'm in my happy place.

1931
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:31,360
Jesus.

1932
01:41:36,030 --> 01:41:36,630
Alright.

1933
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:37,170
Nice.

1934
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:50,840
Are you serious?

1935
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:51,560
Alright.

1936
01:41:56,740 --> 01:41:57,200
Okay.

1937
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:02,950
Oh.

1938
01:42:03,650 --> 01:42:05,430
That second attack is so fast.

1939
01:42:05,790 --> 01:42:06,930
Compared to like...

1940
01:42:06,930 --> 01:42:07,450
Alright, guys.

1941
01:42:07,590 --> 01:42:08,110
This is it.

1942
01:42:08,270 --> 01:42:08,950
I'm gonna...

1943
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:10,310
We're gonna watch this a little bit.

1944
01:42:10,410 --> 01:42:13,730
If you wanna queue up some appraisals right now so I can be full HP.

1945
01:42:13,730 --> 01:42:16,030
This is your moment to shine.

1946
01:42:17,530 --> 01:42:19,470
We can queue it up right here.

1947
01:42:26,270 --> 01:42:26,810
Alright.

1948
01:42:27,830 --> 01:42:28,870
There we go.

1949
01:42:30,170 --> 01:42:30,690
Nice.

1950
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:31,250
We did it.

1951
01:42:31,770 --> 01:42:32,990
See, that wasn't so hard.

1952
01:42:38,030 --> 01:42:39,830
It was pretty difficult.

1953
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:40,530
Not gonna lie.

1954
01:42:40,590 --> 01:42:41,350
No, I lied.

1955
01:42:41,470 --> 01:42:41,910
It was.

1956
01:42:46,190 --> 01:42:46,990
It was.

1957
01:42:46,990 --> 01:42:48,970
It was absolutely very difficult.

1958
01:42:56,020 --> 01:42:56,940
Are you...

1959
01:42:56,940 --> 01:42:57,200
Ah!

1960
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:02,300
I should not have been punished for that.

1961
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:03,380
After like...

1962
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:04,860
All the moves I just did.

1963
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:06,420
That should...

1964
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:07,360
Are you serious?

1965
01:43:09,620 --> 01:43:11,200
That should not have punished me.

1966
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:13,800
Ah!

1967
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:32,630
Alright.

1968
01:43:33,410 --> 01:43:34,850
Here we go again.

1969
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:36,390
It's another...

1970
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:37,570
Another morning.

1971
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:39,410
Another morning.

1972
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:42,210
Another day to die to Malakith.

1973
01:43:43,230 --> 01:43:44,130
Yippee!

1974
01:43:48,570 --> 01:43:52,350
Another morning, another day to die to the big dog.

1975
01:43:54,210 --> 01:43:57,450
It's Tommy, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1976
01:43:57,650 --> 01:44:01,150
She can take her super chats, but she can never take our freedom.

1977
01:44:01,690 --> 01:44:03,530
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1978
01:44:04,230 --> 01:44:06,430
Because I'm so sad.

1979
01:44:07,030 --> 01:44:12,070
I have to fight Malakief and I have to wake up at 10 in the morning tomorrow.

1980
01:44:12,070 --> 01:44:15,050
Like, I'm truly suffering.

1981
01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:19,110
No breaks for Doughkeeper.

1982
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:31,200
All right, fate worse than death.

1983
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:34,220
Oh fuck, I didn't know you were going to praise me there.

1984
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:36,140
I waited too.

1985
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:38,520
I was like, when my praise was coming.

1986
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:42,160
What the fuck, why is he in the air?

1987
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:45,120
I can't see shit, can't get nothing.

1988
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:49,880
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, why is it not working?

1989
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:50,920
Wait, what?

1990
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:52,020
Okay, that's fine.

1991
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:56,140
Oh my god, I've never seen a critical hit before.

1992
01:44:56,480 --> 01:45:01,580
Oh my, I've never, I've never seen that before.

1993
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:03,220
For this guy.

1994
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:07,520
This is the first time I saw a critical hit for this fucking boss.

1995
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:08,720
Oh, death.

1996
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:13,920
Become my blade once more.

1997
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:20,940
Okay, I gave you guys time to queue it up.

1998
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:25,180
And I got a bleed too?

1999
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:31,180
Guys, let's see how I'm gonna like, fuck this up or fuck it up too.

2000
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:36,800
Like, the game actually gave me everything to kill him.

2001
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:41,180
Don't worry, I will still like, disappoint you all.

2002
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:46,580
I'll still find a way.

2003
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:56,100
Oh my god, right here, this is it.

2004
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:04,520
Are you serious?

2005
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,020
Oh my god.

2006
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,040
Oh, you guys are praised already.

2007
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:23,240
I... oh.

2008
01:46:37,330 --> 01:46:37,870
Fucker.

2009
01:46:42,710 --> 01:46:43,910
I don't trust myself.

2010
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:48,520
Are you serious?

2011
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:49,520
No, no, no, no, no.

2012
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:53,480
No, no, no, no, no.

2013
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:55,220
No, no, no, no, no!

2014
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:56,900
Oh.

2015
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:00,280
No, are you serious?

2016
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:18,040
No, don't be greedy.

2017
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:19,240
This is not...

2018
01:47:22,930 --> 01:47:23,450
Yes!

2019
01:47:26,590 --> 01:47:28,550
Oh my god!

2020
01:47:30,230 --> 01:47:32,330
They fucking did it!

2021
01:47:32,890 --> 01:47:34,610
Oh my god!

2022
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:45,880
It's actually over.

2023
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:48,580
Oh my god.

2024
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,360
They fucking did it!

2025
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:55,880
I don't think they just had to give me fucking bleed and critical hit.

2026
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:57,840
Oh!

2027
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:57,960
Oh!

2028
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:02,740
I can't believe it.

2029
01:48:02,860 --> 01:48:03,180
I...

2030
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:06,620
They just needed to give me bleed and critical hit.

2031
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:08,320
This is over with.

2032
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:11,120
Bite size.

2033
01:48:11,420 --> 01:48:13,160
Thank you for the magenta super.

2034
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:13,780
Thank you.

2035
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:14,340
Thank you.

2036
01:48:14,540 --> 01:48:16,080
Nice job, Toki.

2037
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:18,440
Oh!

2038
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:21,980
It's over.

2039
01:48:22,180 --> 01:48:23,960
This was the hardest boss so far.

2040
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:24,800
I know...

2041
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:28,180
I know I'm gonna get fucked over in the future bosses, but...

2042
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:30,080
This one was the hardest.

2043
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:30,980
Look, see, guys?

2044
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:36,440
All we had to do was work together, chat!

2045
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:38,420
I saw your appraisal!

2046
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:39,040
Look at that!

2047
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:42,560
Look how easy it was when we worked together!

2048
01:48:43,580 --> 01:48:47,160
When the streamer builds work, guys!

2049
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:48,480
Wow!

2050
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:55,240
Wow!

2051
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,980
When the streamer builds, it works!

2052
01:48:57,980 --> 01:48:59,880
It actually works!

2053
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:04,240
Now our end of the bargain.

2054
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:07,840
McFluffinkens, thank you in the super chat.

2055
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:09,000
Thank you, thank you.

2056
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,360
Thank you.

2057
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:10,600
You'll be Elden Lord.

2058
01:49:10,820 --> 01:49:11,000
Yay!

2059
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:13,000
I'll be Elden Lord!

2060
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:16,280
Oh my god!

2061
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:17,840
It's over!

2062
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:21,060
Malakim is done!

2063
01:49:24,170 --> 01:49:24,990
Oh!

2064
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:27,090
I'm so happy.

2065
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:28,850
His fucking moves...

2066
01:49:28,850 --> 01:49:29,530
He was so...

2067
01:49:29,530 --> 01:49:30,250
He's so fast.

2068
01:49:30,730 --> 01:49:32,850
That actually, like, tests my reaction time.

2069
01:49:33,830 --> 01:49:37,110
I think if I wasn't so tired today, maybe...

2070
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:40,090
I started today really tired.

2071
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:49,260
Oh!

2072
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:52,480
Where am I?

2073
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:54,200
I destroyed his castle?

2074
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:56,020
Good job, Dragoons!

2075
01:49:56,780 --> 01:49:58,120
We did it!

2076
01:49:58,600 --> 01:49:59,760
Lyle, thank you in the super chat.

2077
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:01,120
Thank you, thank you!

2078
01:50:02,060 --> 01:50:04,220
Soon I will be John Elden Ring.

2079
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:07,780
All right.

2080
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:10,520
Okay, first off, let us...

2081
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:11,840
Okay, guys, what do we do?

2082
01:50:12,540 --> 01:50:13,420
All right, guys.

2083
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:14,740
What do we level up, guys?

2084
01:50:15,470 --> 01:50:16,920
All right, while you decide!

2085
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:19,640
While you decide!

2086
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:23,180
I will hold our end of the...

2087
01:50:23,180 --> 01:50:25,240
My end of the bargain, guys.

2088
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,300
My end of the bargain.

2089
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:27,920
I...

2090
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:28,960
I...

2091
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,200
Am a just king.

2092
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:32,580
Okay?

2093
01:50:34,830 --> 01:50:36,320
I'm not a tyrant.

2094
01:50:39,570 --> 01:50:40,180
All right.

2095
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,840
Where is it?

2096
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:45,800
Okay.

2097
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:48,740
Help me decide what to res...

2098
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:50,860
What to upgrade first before I...

2099
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:53,700
Before I come back.

2100
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:55,520
I'm so tired.

2101
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:57,260
Oh my god, right after that...

2102
01:50:57,260 --> 01:50:59,420
Like, I feel exhausted.

2103
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:05,200
Like, all the adrenaline is gone now.

2104
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:05,500
Look.

2105
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:06,000
See?

2106
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:08,000
Go Kitty lives another day.

2107
01:51:09,460 --> 01:51:11,560
We freed her from the...

2108
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:13,520
We freed her from the...

2109
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:15,200
Um...

2110
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:15,660
Oh my god.

2111
01:51:15,680 --> 01:51:17,860
I can upgrade so much from the basement.

2112
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:20,040
Vigor and Arcane.

2113
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:20,960
Okay, I'll put...

2114
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:23,680
There we go.

2115
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:27,380
She lives another day.

2116
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:30,880
Lord Kurosus, thank you for the super chat.

2117
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:31,780
You're right.

2118
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:32,720
No, you're right.

2119
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:33,660
I do need it.

2120
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,060
After everything I've been through.

2121
01:51:35,580 --> 01:51:36,120
You're right.

2122
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:37,140
Next seat.

2123
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,040
Where is it?

2124
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:43,420
There you go.

2125
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:44,700
This is how I feel right now.

2126
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:46,540
This is actually how I feel.

2127
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:51,420
Okay.

2128
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,440
Where's the next bot?

2129
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,580
Oh yeah.

2130
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:56,940
Oh my gosh.

2131
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:00,320
See guys?

2132
01:52:00,620 --> 01:52:00,680
See guys?

2133
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:03,440
All we had to do was send the women, children, and the elderly.

2134
01:52:03,820 --> 01:52:05,200
That's all we had to do.

2135
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:07,620
It wasn't so bad.

2136
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:12,380
Yet stands tall and we're mindless of the scorch of the flame everyone's.

2137
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:13,540
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2138
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:16,580
There then we are yet golden ones.

2139
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:19,140
All right.

2140
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:21,740
Let's see.

2141
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,000
We go this way.

2142
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:28,400
Ramona, thank you for the super chat.

2143
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:28,820
Thank you.

2144
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:29,600
Thank you.

2145
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:31,680
We did it, guys.

2146
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:37,760
All we had to do was just get pregnant, have kids, and then give them a controller.

2147
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,180
The moment they're born.

2148
01:52:42,180 --> 01:52:43,720
And then appraise me.

2149
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,860
Last chance for that Akasufa.

2150
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:48,960
Thank you for the super chat.

2151
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,340
Thank you, thank you.

2152
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:53,600
I can't wait for my mac and cheese, guys.

2153
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:55,900
I am looking forward to it.

2154
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:58,700
An appraisal for the ride.

2155
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:00,800
Where the fuck do I go?

2156
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,700
Alan, how much for Melania?

2157
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:09,960
I'll do it for...

2158
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:11,780
All right, you guys want to know?

2159
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:12,940
How much for Melania?

2160
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,100
Who's gonna fund my...

2161
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:17,460
Who's gonna fund my 3D?

2162
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:22,620
You guys really want to know?

2163
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:23,440
All right.

2164
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,880
This is the only way you'll get me to do Melania.

2165
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:43,280
I will sell...

2166
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:44,580
I will sell my dignity.

2167
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,360
So I can afford...

2168
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:47,960
Not...

2169
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:50,200
Well, I mean, I could afford it, but like, it's still expensive.

2170
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:51,480
So I can...

2171
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:56,260
So I don't have to hurt my wallet too much for my 3D.

2172
01:54:02,700 --> 01:54:04,280
So I can...

2173
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:08,180
So you have a pretty sick 3D debut.

2174
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:13,760
That I do love buying your dignity.

2175
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:18,620
Next thing, thank you for the super chat.

2176
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:20,200
Thank you for the Aka Super.

2177
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:21,620
Thank you, thank you.

2178
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:25,460
For Melania, now is the time.

2179
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:28,100
Leo, thank you for the Aka Super.

2180
01:54:28,620 --> 01:54:29,700
Thank you, thank you.

2181
01:54:31,980 --> 01:54:32,740
Oh, wait.

2182
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:34,180
Wait, is that another boss?

2183
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:34,960
Do I get...

2184
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:35,540
Like...

2185
01:54:35,540 --> 01:54:36,060
Oh, shit.

2186
01:54:36,260 --> 01:54:36,660
Wait, what?

2187
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:37,540
I just got...

2188
01:54:37,540 --> 01:54:38,800
I just finished.

2189
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:40,660
Wait, what?

2190
01:54:58,510 --> 01:55:00,350
No dialogue for you.

2191
01:55:02,430 --> 01:55:05,530
He's like, excuse me, I'm trying to monologue.

2192
01:55:05,830 --> 01:55:06,870
I'm like, no.

2193
01:55:09,510 --> 01:55:10,630
No monologue.

2194
01:55:13,250 --> 01:55:14,530
Like, we just fight.

2195
01:55:15,510 --> 01:55:16,890
I've already been through so much.

2196
01:55:17,570 --> 01:55:18,890
Oh my god.

2197
01:55:19,090 --> 01:55:19,730
You here?

2198
01:55:24,540 --> 01:55:26,020
Oh my god.

2199
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:28,060
Oh, this is bad.

2200
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:30,020
Because I don't think he monologues after that.

2201
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:36,860
Oh my god.

2202
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:44,870
What?

2203
01:55:45,810 --> 01:55:47,930
That's so much damage.

2204
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:51,530
Also, thank you everybody for the Aka Super.

2205
01:55:52,070 --> 01:55:53,890
Thank you, thank you.

2206
01:55:54,290 --> 01:55:55,510
Alright, at least this is close.

2207
01:55:55,510 --> 01:55:59,150
I literally just got out of a fucking Malachy.

2208
01:56:01,030 --> 01:56:04,590
Wait, I guess like, if I have the mark thing.

2209
01:56:04,810 --> 01:56:05,350
Oh my god.

2210
01:56:05,450 --> 01:56:06,950
Now he doesn't monologue anymore.

2211
01:56:06,950 --> 01:56:07,710
I'm so sad.

2212
01:56:08,270 --> 01:56:09,570
Please, can you talk again?

2213
01:56:09,870 --> 01:56:12,510
I'm sorry for like, interrupting your last monologue.

2214
01:56:12,510 --> 01:56:13,070
Oh my god, but like...

2215
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:17,030
What is this mark?

2216
01:56:17,990 --> 01:56:20,410
I don't know what this mark is.

2217
01:56:21,050 --> 01:56:22,490
It's just unclear.

2218
01:56:26,830 --> 01:56:29,650
Like, what is this thing that I have on me?

2219
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:37,980
I don't know what I have on me.

2220
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:40,020
How?

2221
01:56:40,220 --> 01:56:40,580
How?

2222
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:45,400
Look, I've already been through a lot.

2223
01:56:46,180 --> 01:56:47,740
I'm not thinking anymore.

2224
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,380
Like, I don't know what...

2225
01:56:57,380 --> 01:56:57,720
What...

2226
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:59,780
What is this thing I have on my body?

2227
01:57:00,620 --> 01:57:01,560
What is that?

2228
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:05,960
Oh wait, I should pick this up, actually.

2229
01:57:20,820 --> 01:57:22,300
Like, what is that?

2230
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:24,600
What, what hit me?

2231
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:29,200
What is that chat?

2232
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:35,660
Yeah, but what was that thing that hit me?

2233
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:41,340
And how do I...

2234
01:57:44,170 --> 01:57:46,210
I don't know what that thing is that hit me.

2235
01:57:46,310 --> 01:57:46,810
That's the thing.

2236
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,680
How do I counter that?

2237
01:57:56,550 --> 01:57:58,870
Oh, don't attack like that right now.

2238
01:57:59,010 --> 01:57:59,970
He has it right now.

2239
01:58:00,230 --> 01:58:01,770
Do I not attack him when he has that?

2240
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:04,110
It's on him now.

2241
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:11,620
When does it stop?

2242
01:58:16,660 --> 01:58:17,820
When does it stop?

2243
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:18,920
He still has it.

2244
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:22,880
Oh my god, it's forever!

2245
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:24,100
When does it end?

2246
01:58:25,420 --> 01:58:27,100
Oh, five hits.

2247
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:27,540
Okay.

2248
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:30,420
But how do I counter that, though?

2249
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:35,320
Oh!

2250
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:37,680
Oh, so...

2251
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:40,080
Time hit just don't spam?

2252
01:58:40,300 --> 01:58:41,500
Oh, hit and run!

2253
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:42,180
Oh!

2254
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:43,320
It's forever!

2255
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:44,100
Okay.

2256
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:45,460
I was like, so confused.

2257
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:46,860
I was like, when does it stop?

2258
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:51,580
What the fuck?

2259
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:53,020
I get it.

2260
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:54,180
I get it now.

2261
01:58:54,620 --> 01:58:56,040
I was like, what the fuck?

2262
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:57,300
Why is it so...

2263
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:02,120
I still don't know what he puts on me, though.

2264
01:59:07,410 --> 01:59:09,490
What is that thing he puts on me?

2265
01:59:15,490 --> 01:59:17,310
Oh my god, that's just everything.

2266
01:59:17,770 --> 01:59:19,170
Like, you gotta fuck me, I guess.

2267
01:59:19,370 --> 01:59:19,870
That's just...

2268
01:59:19,870 --> 01:59:21,770
He just shoots everything at me.

2269
01:59:22,430 --> 01:59:25,370
Jellyfish, please, my child, do something!

2270
01:59:37,390 --> 01:59:38,430
Oh my god.

2271
01:59:41,770 --> 01:59:42,450
Oh my god.

2272
01:59:42,450 --> 01:59:42,770
Oh my god, okay.

2273
01:59:46,070 --> 01:59:46,770
That's fine.

2274
01:59:47,570 --> 01:59:48,230
That's fine.

2275
01:59:48,230 --> 01:59:48,470
That's not fine.

2276
01:59:48,650 --> 01:59:50,590
I thought he was gonna hit my child.

2277
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:57,860
Are you...

2278
01:59:57,860 --> 01:59:58,440
What?

2279
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:03,660
Oh, I can backstab him?

2280
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:05,840
Oh wait, he's me.

2281
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:06,360
He's me.

2282
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:07,680
Okay, yeah, of course I can.

2283
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:08,420
He's a person.

2284
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:10,900
Guys, I'm not okay right now.

2285
02:00:11,060 --> 02:00:12,940
My brain is like, I don't have...

2286
02:00:12,940 --> 02:00:14,140
I'm not thinking anymore.

2287
02:00:19,100 --> 02:00:20,100
I'm not...

2288
02:00:20,820 --> 02:00:22,780
I'm not a person anymore.

2289
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:26,180
It's like, the little guy in my head is dead.

2290
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:29,680
He's actually...

2291
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:30,860
He's just dead.

2292
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:34,320
Like, he's been found at the crime scene.

2293
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:37,000
He's not okay, guys.

2294
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,320
I'm gonna try to see if I can get the backstab.

2295
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:42,120
Guys, he won't let me backstab him.

2296
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:42,820
I don't know why.

2297
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:45,480
I'm actually trying to...

2298
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:49,620
That's three.

2299
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:52,040
Four.

2300
02:00:52,580 --> 02:00:53,260
There we go.

2301
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:53,700
Oh, five.

2302
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:54,220
There we go.

2303
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:01,700
Okay.

2304
02:01:03,340 --> 02:01:05,220
Oh my god, he did another one?

2305
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:08,680
Okay.

2306
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:11,820
Let me...

2307
02:01:11,820 --> 02:01:13,700
One, two, three.

2308
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:14,420
Are you...

2309
02:01:14,420 --> 02:01:15,920
Oh, it's so fast.

2310
02:01:16,020 --> 02:01:17,220
I need to do the heavy attacks.

2311
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:21,700
I need to do the heavy attacks.

2312
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:27,840
Oh my god, the fucking nerd.

2313
02:01:28,940 --> 02:01:30,880
The goddamn nerd.

2314
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:33,580
The nerd is getting to me.

2315
02:01:33,860 --> 02:01:35,900
I can't stuff him in the locker.

2316
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:36,020
The fucker.

2317
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:41,360
Okay.

2318
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:46,640
If only I can stuff this man in the locker, then it'd be over for him.

2319
02:01:50,020 --> 02:01:51,840
Oh my god, you fucker.

2320
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:54,880
Yes, run to the child!

2321
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:56,580
Yes!

2322
02:01:57,260 --> 02:01:57,860
Yes!

2323
02:01:58,300 --> 02:01:59,740
Run to the child!

2324
02:02:07,260 --> 02:02:09,600
Oh my god, you're such a fucker.

2325
02:02:09,980 --> 02:02:10,400
I hope...

2326
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:12,080
I hope no one loves you.

2327
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:13,600
And then you'll never find love.

2328
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:17,780
Get up!

2329
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:26,520
Oh my god.

2330
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:28,360
Oh, you're...

2331
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:29,980
You are a whore.

2332
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:37,580
Okay, I'm just gonna drink a health potion here.

2333
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:40,520
That's right!

2334
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:45,200
You'll never find love!

2335
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:55,400
Jesus, how many...

2336
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:55,740
Oh no!

2337
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:56,940
No, that's good.

2338
02:02:59,340 --> 02:03:00,340
That's right!

2339
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:03,660
You're paying too much attention to my child!

2340
02:03:07,740 --> 02:03:08,740
Oh my god!

2341
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:09,440
Oh my god!

2342
02:03:09,580 --> 02:03:10,140
I am...

2343
02:03:10,140 --> 02:03:10,820
I'm...

2344
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:11,280
I'm...

2345
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:11,780
What...

2346
02:03:11,780 --> 02:03:13,940
What is he doing to me?

2347
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:14,720
What...

2348
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:16,200
Actually...

2349
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:18,800
Actually, what is he doing to me?

2350
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:20,460
Holy shit!

2351
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:23,600
Like...

2352
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:25,480
Oh my god!

2353
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:27,640
What is that?

2354
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:35,800
Okay, that was like a little embarrassing though.

2355
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,660
I will admit.

2356
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:44,040
Oh my god.

2357
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,360
I can't.

2358
02:03:46,860 --> 02:03:47,700
He's...

2359
02:03:47,700 --> 02:03:49,680
I'm scared of this nerd right now.

2360
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:52,700
There we go!

2361
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:54,720
Okay, slow and steady!

2362
02:03:55,300 --> 02:03:55,980
Slow...

2363
02:03:58,360 --> 02:03:59,040
Slow and steady!

2364
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:00,540
Slow and steady!

2365
02:04:04,700 --> 02:04:06,540
It's okay, we did it!

2366
02:04:07,020 --> 02:04:08,380
We killed a nerd!

2367
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:10,700
Oh my god!

2368
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:14,520
Oh my god!

2369
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:16,300
The spectra of all...

2370
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:16,780
Let's go!

2371
02:04:17,100 --> 02:04:18,000
We don't need...

2372
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,380
For such a stupid ass nerd build!

2373
02:04:20,780 --> 02:04:21,740
Oh my god!

2374
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:25,840
Get this nerd out of here!

2375
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:27,120
All right!

2376
02:04:29,420 --> 02:04:31,460
Into the locker he goes!

2377
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:32,860
All right!

2378
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:36,100
Liam, thank you for the Akasupa!

2379
02:04:36,280 --> 02:04:36,520
Thank you!

2380
02:04:36,660 --> 02:04:37,060
Thank you!

2381
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:37,160
Thank you!

2382
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:38,540
We can't give up dragoons!

2383
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:39,920
Imagine the content!

2384
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:43,340
Imagine how funny it would be!

2385
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:44,500
All right, guys!

2386
02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:46,000
What do we do?

2387
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:46,500
Bigger?

2388
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:47,860
I guess arcane?

2389
02:04:48,020 --> 02:04:49,140
Do we do bigger and arcane?

2390
02:04:54,760 --> 02:04:55,440
All right.

2391
02:04:56,020 --> 02:04:58,400
Another name is also all spamming.

2392
02:04:58,940 --> 02:04:59,520
Uh, koi koi!

2393
02:04:59,620 --> 02:05:00,360
I did give you a super shot!

2394
02:05:00,460 --> 02:05:00,720
Thank you!

2395
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:01,280
Thank you!

2396
02:05:01,420 --> 02:05:01,580
Kill!

2397
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:03,860
Uh, more big...

2398
02:05:03,860 --> 02:05:05,460
Okay, that's all I could do anyway.

2399
02:05:06,340 --> 02:05:06,800
All right.

2400
02:05:08,680 --> 02:05:10,600
More vigor and arcane.

2401
02:05:12,020 --> 02:05:13,200
No more arcane?

2402
02:05:15,940 --> 02:05:17,800
Uh, it's because I was...

2403
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:19,800
I was never trained to fight nerds.

2404
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:24,620
I was never expecting them to fight back.

2405
02:05:24,860 --> 02:05:26,020
I was now trained for that.

2406
02:05:28,580 --> 02:05:29,140
I...

2407
02:05:29,140 --> 02:05:29,540
I...

2408
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:30,560
I'm actually...

2409
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:32,180
I'm so head empty right now.

2410
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:36,960
Like, my mind has died on Malekith.

2411
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:44,860
He got a heart attack and now there's like a fucking dead body in my head.

2412
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:47,240
Rotting.

2413
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:51,100
Are you ready?

2414
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:51,740
No.

2415
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:55,680
No, I'm not ready.

2416
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:57,540
I'm not.

2417
02:05:59,240 --> 02:06:00,200
Nerds are not...

2418
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:02,600
Yeah, I was not expecting for a nerd to fight back.

2419
02:06:03,260 --> 02:06:03,860
Back...

2420
02:06:03,860 --> 02:06:05,540
They were never supposed to fight back.

2421
02:06:05,900 --> 02:06:06,500
Back...

2422
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:06,820
Back...

2423
02:06:06,820 --> 02:06:07,400
What is this?

2424
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:09,100
A fucking boss rush?

2425
02:06:09,460 --> 02:06:10,060
Like...

2426
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:14,440
What is this fucking...

2427
02:06:14,440 --> 02:06:14,880
I...

2428
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:15,920
I get no rest.

2429
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:18,080
I go straight to the next one.

2430
02:06:20,580 --> 02:06:21,880
Oh my god.

2431
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:22,800
Oh my god.

2432
02:06:22,980 --> 02:06:23,420
It's him.

2433
02:06:23,820 --> 02:06:26,040
It's him with his stupid tiger shit.

2434
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:35,800
I literally is like...

2435
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:36,240
But wait!

2436
02:06:36,580 --> 02:06:38,000
There's more Doki!

2437
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:40,500
Oh my god.

2438
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:44,020
She is so not...

2439
02:06:44,020 --> 02:06:44,540
I'm not.

2440
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:47,600
Truth be told, I am not.

2441
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:49,460
Hey, thank you for the super chat.

2442
02:06:49,580 --> 02:06:49,820
Thank you.

2443
02:06:50,040 --> 02:06:50,520
Thank you.

2444
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:53,980
This is gonna pay for my 3D.

2445
02:06:54,240 --> 02:06:57,440
But who's gonna pay for the post-millennial therapy though?

2446
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:00,680
Oh my god.

2447
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:01,000
Okay.

2448
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:04,200
Speaking of the 3D, I almost lost 50k.

2449
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:06,640
Because of the bank transfer.

2450
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:07,640
Because they...

2451
02:07:07,640 --> 02:07:08,100
My...

2452
02:07:08,100 --> 02:07:08,800
I hate my bank.

2453
02:07:08,900 --> 02:07:10,160
I hate my bank so much.

2454
02:07:10,300 --> 02:07:10,520
I...

2455
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:11,480
I swear to God.

2456
02:07:11,820 --> 02:07:13,100
Like, one day...

2457
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:13,980
Maybe in the future.

2458
02:07:13,980 --> 02:07:16,460
Next year, I'm swapping business accounts.

2459
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:18,200
I hate this bank so much.

2460
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:19,180
Because like...

2461
02:07:19,180 --> 02:07:19,880
They...

2462
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:20,640
They put...

2463
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:23,160
They did a typo on the wire transfer name.

2464
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:24,600
Of the guy that's...

2465
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:26,140
The company that's supposed to receive it.

2466
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:28,480
They actually put like an extra letter.

2467
02:07:28,760 --> 02:07:29,900
And the thing is...

2468
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:30,160
I...

2469
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:30,940
They didn't tell them.

2470
02:07:31,100 --> 02:07:31,520
Because like...

2471
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:33,020
They put in the extra instructions.

2472
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:34,240
But I don't...

2473
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:34,640
I didn't...

2474
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:35,980
They didn't show me the extra instructions.

2475
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:38,560
They only showed me like the front page.

2476
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:41,400
Which I had to assign and signature the approval and everything.

2477
02:07:41,780 --> 02:07:42,980
And then like...

2478
02:07:42,980 --> 02:07:43,480
Um...

2479
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:44,180
And then like...

2480
02:07:44,180 --> 02:07:45,820
The 3D production company was like...

2481
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:47,360
Yeah, we can't receive your...

2482
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:48,080
Your money.

2483
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:49,060
Because...

2484
02:07:49,060 --> 02:07:49,520
Um...

2485
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:50,420
There's a typo.

2486
02:07:50,700 --> 02:07:52,020
And then...

2487
02:07:52,700 --> 02:07:54,100
And then like...

2488
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:55,080
Um...

2489
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:55,740
Uh...

2490
02:07:55,740 --> 02:07:56,760
And then like...

2491
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:58,480
I went to my bank and was like...

2492
02:07:58,480 --> 02:07:59,220
Please fix this.

2493
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:00,940
And then they charged me...

2494
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:02,840
25 dollars!

2495
02:08:04,540 --> 02:08:07,080
To fix their fucking mistake!

2496
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:09,940
Alright, there he is.

2497
02:08:10,040 --> 02:08:11,740
The first Elden Lord.

2498
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:15,780
They charged me...

2499
02:08:15,780 --> 02:08:16,400
Oh my god.

2500
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:18,280
I'm not ready to fight the first Elden Lord.

2501
02:08:20,120 --> 02:08:21,220
I'm not ready.

2502
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:22,960
But maybe she is.

2503
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:26,700
They charged me 25 dollars!

2504
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:30,160
Because they fucked up!

2505
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:32,200
Sorry.

2506
02:08:32,900 --> 02:08:33,260
I...

2507
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:36,880
I have to go back and grab my shit.

2508
02:08:39,100 --> 02:08:41,000
Now the chalk.

2509
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:44,820
Now I gotta fight the nerd's boyfriend.

2510
02:08:50,700 --> 02:08:52,300
Zeku, thank you for the Akasupa.

2511
02:08:52,540 --> 02:08:52,840
Thank you.

2512
02:08:53,020 --> 02:08:53,660
Thank you.

2513
02:08:54,540 --> 02:08:55,120
But yeah.

2514
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:56,400
I think my 3D...

2515
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:59,080
My 3D debut might be like...

2516
02:08:59,080 --> 02:08:59,540
I...

2517
02:08:59,540 --> 02:08:59,740
I...

2518
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:01,800
I mean, I was gonna reveal the price for it.

2519
02:09:01,940 --> 02:09:04,420
But I think it could be like 100k.

2520
02:09:04,420 --> 02:09:05,280
That's why...

2521
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,060
I'm gonna try to work as hard as I can.

2522
02:09:07,220 --> 02:09:07,940
For this year.

2523
02:09:09,460 --> 02:09:09,800
So...

2524
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:11,140
And I can't afford it.

2525
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:11,930
But like, you know...

2526
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:15,500
I wanna make it worth it.

2527
02:09:19,610 --> 02:09:20,310
Still a lot.

2528
02:09:20,470 --> 02:09:20,910
Oh my god.

2529
02:09:21,010 --> 02:09:21,590
I just want my souls.

2530
02:09:22,250 --> 02:09:22,350
Please.

2531
02:09:27,330 --> 02:09:29,330
I wanna make it good for you guys.

2532
02:09:29,470 --> 02:09:31,030
You guys have been waiting like...

2533
02:09:31,030 --> 02:09:31,590
Like what?

2534
02:09:31,710 --> 02:09:33,450
Four years for my 3D...

2535
02:09:33,450 --> 02:09:35,530
Like official 3D debut.

2536
02:09:42,290 --> 02:09:42,770
Okay.

2537
02:09:44,750 --> 02:09:47,030
I'm planning on having a lot of guests over.

2538
02:09:47,570 --> 02:09:48,050
Still.

2539
02:09:52,420 --> 02:09:54,540
I'm planning on having a lot of guests.

2540
02:10:00,870 --> 02:10:01,930
Well, not a lot.

2541
02:10:02,130 --> 02:10:03,010
But like, you know...

2542
02:10:03,790 --> 02:10:07,070
I wanna celebrate it with all my friends and dragoons.

2543
02:10:11,500 --> 02:10:13,160
But it's not just for like...

2544
02:10:13,160 --> 02:10:14,340
The concert itself.

2545
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:15,400
Um...

2546
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:16,940
I also wanna, you know, pay for...

2547
02:10:19,220 --> 02:10:19,700
Um...

2548
02:10:19,700 --> 02:10:22,260
Help pay for some of the trips for my guests too.

2549
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:24,400
To fly to the studio.

2550
02:10:25,400 --> 02:10:28,420
Because I feel bad making them pocket their money...

2551
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:30,440
To be in my 3D debut, you know?

2552
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:38,240
I feel bad, you know?

2553
02:10:38,420 --> 02:10:39,180
Like having...

2554
02:10:39,180 --> 02:10:42,900
I wanna like help pay for them to fly to the studio.

2555
02:10:43,380 --> 02:10:44,840
Because like, I don't want them...

2556
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:46,800
Like it's not just from the debut itself.

2557
02:10:46,940 --> 02:10:48,980
It's also like lights and stuff too.

2558
02:10:50,280 --> 02:10:54,540
Because like, you know, they're giving up their time to be part of my 3D debut.

2559
02:10:56,540 --> 02:10:56,940
Thank you.

2560
02:10:56,940 --> 02:10:57,540
Wondrous for the gold.

2561
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:00,500
The 100 is for you to be Elden Clapped right now.

2562
02:11:00,720 --> 02:11:02,460
May, thank you for the Akosupa.

2563
02:11:02,680 --> 02:11:02,960
Thank you.

2564
02:11:03,160 --> 02:11:03,640
Thank you.

2565
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:04,420
Yeah.

2566
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:06,720
I hope it's not a 100...

2567
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:07,660
Like, 100k.

2568
02:11:08,140 --> 02:11:09,760
I'm just like trying to set aside.

2569
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:12,560
I'm trying to save up that much right now.

2570
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:13,140
Alright.

2571
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:21,560
Okay.

2572
02:11:21,940 --> 02:11:22,100
Alright.

2573
02:11:22,220 --> 02:11:22,560
I'm focusing.

2574
02:11:22,980 --> 02:11:24,420
I fought him before!

2575
02:11:25,900 --> 02:11:28,300
Oh, clearly I had...

2576
02:11:28,300 --> 02:11:29,880
Clearly I forgot everything.

2577
02:11:34,730 --> 02:11:35,570
Alright.

2578
02:11:35,570 --> 02:11:37,270
I fought him before.

2579
02:11:37,510 --> 02:11:38,050
But I forgot.

2580
02:11:42,620 --> 02:11:43,340
Oh.

2581
02:11:46,220 --> 02:11:46,940
Oh.

2582
02:11:50,600 --> 02:11:51,320
Whoa.

2583
02:11:55,330 --> 02:11:56,690
Go my child.

2584
02:12:00,690 --> 02:12:01,990
Oh my god.

2585
02:12:04,330 --> 02:12:05,730
Oh my god.

2586
02:12:06,230 --> 02:12:06,490
Oh!

2587
02:12:06,770 --> 02:12:06,990
Okay.

2588
02:12:08,030 --> 02:12:08,310
Alright.

2589
02:12:08,410 --> 02:12:09,130
At least he's poisoned.

2590
02:12:09,550 --> 02:12:09,950
That's cool.

2591
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:17,800
Don't worry.

2592
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:20,980
That 3D debut would be my last big investment.

2593
02:12:21,540 --> 02:12:24,100
And then, like, big investment in the channel.

2594
02:12:24,340 --> 02:12:25,340
And then...

2595
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:26,980
Because, like, I want to make something cool.

2596
02:12:27,020 --> 02:12:29,020
Because you guys have been waiting for, like, what?

2597
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:31,440
Four plus years for my official 3D.

2598
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:33,380
What the fuck was that?

2599
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:49,920
Alright.

2600
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:51,060
Oh, definitely.

2601
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:51,380
Thank you.

2602
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:52,520
Thank you.

2603
02:12:52,660 --> 02:12:52,960
Thank you.

2604
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:53,080
Thank you.

2605
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:54,440
This will be my first soup.

2606
02:12:54,840 --> 02:12:55,220
Ooppa.

2607
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:55,600
Okay.

2608
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:57,260
This might contribute to your fight against Milena.

2609
02:12:57,340 --> 02:12:58,360
Or, I mean, your 3D.

2610
02:12:59,440 --> 02:12:59,840
Potatoes.

2611
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:00,960
Welcome to Tomato Farm.

2612
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:01,800
Welcome, welcome.

2613
02:13:02,120 --> 02:13:02,880
I swear to god.

2614
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:04,760
This would be my last big investment.

2615
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:05,500
And then...

2616
02:13:05,500 --> 02:13:06,740
And then it's smooth sailing.

2617
02:13:07,260 --> 02:13:08,040
And then we chill.

2618
02:13:08,260 --> 02:13:09,080
And then we chill.

2619
02:13:09,260 --> 02:13:09,400
Chill.

2620
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:11,200
This would be my last one.

2621
02:13:11,380 --> 02:13:12,640
My last big investment.

2622
02:13:12,940 --> 02:13:16,500
Because we waited four plus years for my official 3D debut.

2623
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:23,720
I had big plans for it.

2624
02:13:24,080 --> 02:13:25,180
But I can still...

2625
02:13:25,180 --> 02:13:26,600
I can still do it.

2626
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:27,980
I can still recreate it.

2627
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:29,340
Like, my original plans.

2628
02:13:33,020 --> 02:13:34,200
And then the house.

2629
02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:35,140
Guys, I swear to god.

2630
02:13:35,320 --> 02:13:37,440
This is where I do the house thing.

2631
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:42,160
That's why I've also been taking a lot of sponsors too.

2632
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:44,060
Because I want to be...

2633
02:13:47,180 --> 02:13:47,620
Okay.

2634
02:13:49,360 --> 02:13:51,260
I legitimately forgot to fight this guy.

2635
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:53,220
I swear today...

2636
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:55,580
I think today's just like my extra off day.

2637
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:08,700
And I want to create lots of happy memories with my drag wounds.

2638
02:14:17,090 --> 02:14:17,770
Okay.

2639
02:14:18,030 --> 02:14:19,370
Lots of happy memories.

2640
02:14:20,030 --> 02:14:21,390
Before it's gone.

2641
02:14:22,170 --> 02:14:23,770
Before my career dies.

2642
02:14:29,930 --> 02:14:31,190
Oh my god.

2643
02:14:31,550 --> 02:14:32,730
This stupid jock.

2644
02:14:33,110 --> 02:14:34,930
I want to stuff this man into a locker.

2645
02:14:37,170 --> 02:14:37,930
All right.

2646
02:14:38,090 --> 02:14:39,070
I'm focusing up now.

2647
02:14:51,740 --> 02:14:52,740
I'm not.

2648
02:14:54,280 --> 02:14:54,800
JK.

2649
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:55,960
JK.

2650
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:57,940
Bro, why is his clone...

2651
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:00,380
So much easier.

2652
02:15:02,120 --> 02:15:02,640
Like...

2653
02:15:03,420 --> 02:15:04,840
Like, I swear to god.

2654
02:15:04,980 --> 02:15:07,160
I don't know how I fought the robot guy.

2655
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:08,440
The clone.

2656
02:15:09,380 --> 02:15:10,340
It's because he was AI.

2657
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:11,300
See guys?

2658
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:13,080
AI will never be better than the original.

2659
02:15:14,740 --> 02:15:16,020
This proves it.

2660
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:19,460
AI will never be better than the original, guys.

2661
02:15:31,390 --> 02:15:31,970
Okay.

2662
02:15:41,940 --> 02:15:43,420
Am I actually on her level?

2663
02:15:50,540 --> 02:15:52,260
Oh my god.

2664
02:15:52,740 --> 02:15:54,220
Oh my god.

2665
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:57,660
Oh my god.

2666
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,260
He's just stomping me.

2667
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:02,020
He's just stepping on me.

2668
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:03,280
But little does he know.

2669
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:04,900
The dragon was like it.

2670
02:16:09,420 --> 02:16:10,480
Happens after that.

2671
02:16:13,180 --> 02:16:14,300
Jesus Christ.

2672
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,420
Oh my god.

2673
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:22,840
I know this other...

2674
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:24,720
His second form, he grabs people.

2675
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:25,680
So like, I'm fucked.

2676
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:28,080
Like, if anything, I always get grabbed.

2677
02:16:28,280 --> 02:16:28,620
All right, guys.

2678
02:16:28,740 --> 02:16:29,180
This is it.

2679
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:30,660
Put your appraisals in.

2680
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:31,740
Put your...

2681
02:16:31,740 --> 02:16:34,360
Put your appraisals in, guys.

2682
02:16:34,940 --> 02:16:36,140
This is it.

2683
02:16:36,700 --> 02:16:39,160
This is our buffer appraisal time.

2684
02:16:40,040 --> 02:16:41,780
Rodrigo, thank you for the super chat.

2685
02:16:41,940 --> 02:16:43,020
Thank you, thank you.

2686
02:16:43,480 --> 02:16:44,260
And then very soon.

2687
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:46,280
Let's have lots of happy memories together.

2688
02:16:46,740 --> 02:16:48,100
Even while I'm suffering.

2689
02:16:48,280 --> 02:16:50,900
At least you're having a happy time, right?

2690
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:07,460
What's next?

2691
02:17:07,940 --> 02:17:08,680
What's next?

2692
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:11,920
Godfrey, what's next?

2693
02:17:12,580 --> 02:17:13,640
What's named Godfrey?

2694
02:17:13,820 --> 02:17:14,620
I don't fucking know.

2695
02:17:14,620 --> 02:17:16,160
I'm just giving people random names.

2696
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:20,160
It's Zangief time.

2697
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:29,260
I've given thee courtesy enough.

2698
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:35,940
Oh my god.

2699
02:17:36,120 --> 02:17:37,180
He's gonna grab me.

2700
02:17:37,540 --> 02:17:38,680
No, I know it.

2701
02:17:38,780 --> 02:17:40,300
I know he's gonna grab me.

2702
02:17:40,460 --> 02:17:41,400
I could feel...

2703
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:42,840
I'm gonna get grabbed right here.

2704
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:46,140
I don't even know when the cutscene's gonna end.

2705
02:17:46,140 --> 02:17:46,980
It's gonna end.

2706
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:47,840
I won't know it.

2707
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:48,860
And then I'm gonna get grabbed.

2708
02:17:50,700 --> 02:17:53,900
Now I fight just horror-lood.

2709
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:56,080
Horror-lood.

2710
02:18:02,380 --> 02:18:03,280
Oh my god.

2711
02:18:03,460 --> 02:18:03,840
Oh my god.

2712
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:04,540
I fucking know.

2713
02:18:09,020 --> 02:18:11,460
Wow, it's like I predicted it.

2714
02:18:16,040 --> 02:18:22,460
It's like I predicted it, guys.

2715
02:18:22,680 --> 02:18:24,000
I would've thought.

2716
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:34,360
I can't believe it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy.

2717
02:18:34,360 --> 02:18:36,740
I wrote the script.

2718
02:18:42,820 --> 02:18:44,000
Oh my god.

2719
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:49,840
I can't believe I predicted it perfectly.

2720
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:54,740
I knew my fate.

2721
02:18:55,020 --> 02:18:57,140
I knew what he was gonna do.

2722
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:04,560
To my loyal fans.

2723
02:19:05,080 --> 02:19:06,560
The sim of life begins.

2724
02:19:07,020 --> 02:19:08,020
Thank you for the Hakasu.

2725
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:08,940
But thank you.

2726
02:19:09,080 --> 02:19:09,660
Thank you.

2727
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:13,820
It's like oh my...

2728
02:19:13,820 --> 02:19:14,420
It's like...

2729
02:19:14,420 --> 02:19:15,260
Oh my god.

2730
02:19:15,400 --> 02:19:16,300
I was just not ready.

2731
02:19:16,680 --> 02:19:17,460
You know what?

2732
02:19:17,640 --> 02:19:19,100
No, that was on me.

2733
02:19:33,870 --> 02:19:34,590
It's okay.

2734
02:19:34,590 --> 02:19:34,710
All right.

2735
02:19:47,550 --> 02:19:48,270
Okay.

2736
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:54,240
Oh.

2737
02:19:58,580 --> 02:19:59,560
It's okay.

2738
02:20:00,280 --> 02:20:01,880
My child will be okay.

2739
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:04,600
Oh my god.

2740
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:05,660
Oh my god.

2741
02:20:05,800 --> 02:20:06,960
Okay, but what about me?

2742
02:20:10,380 --> 02:20:12,000
What about me?

2743
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:15,480
What about me?

2744
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:17,200
I'm also a child.

2745
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:20,460
I'm also a child too.

2746
02:20:25,150 --> 02:20:27,230
You won't be okay.

2747
02:20:27,670 --> 02:20:30,030
Your child is okay though.

2748
02:20:30,630 --> 02:20:32,390
My child outlived me.

2749
02:20:34,590 --> 02:20:36,630
Good thing you were a king player in Tekken.

2750
02:20:36,770 --> 02:20:39,670
Also, this is the boss that made Nimi drop this game.

2751
02:20:40,050 --> 02:20:40,810
Wait, really?

2752
02:20:41,510 --> 02:20:42,810
Aztec, thank you in the super chat.

2753
02:20:42,910 --> 02:20:43,090
Thank you.

2754
02:20:43,210 --> 02:20:43,530
Thank you.

2755
02:20:43,630 --> 02:20:47,430
I feel like this boss is not friendly towards magic builds though.

2756
02:20:48,730 --> 02:20:51,070
In general, because he's like the charger.

2757
02:21:02,870 --> 02:21:07,710
I don't get it, but I watched all these other Elden Ring players play too.

2758
02:21:08,870 --> 02:21:11,030
How come I can't do the things they're doing?

2759
02:21:14,850 --> 02:21:16,390
Oh, I panic rolled.

2760
02:21:16,570 --> 02:21:42,450
I panic rolled, yes.

2761
02:21:42,450 --> 02:21:45,050
I want to make it like it's a corpo for 3D.

2762
02:21:45,250 --> 02:21:45,430
You know?

2763
02:21:45,630 --> 02:21:46,710
I don't want to half-ass it.

2764
02:21:46,990 --> 02:21:50,030
I want to have the best quality as I can.

2765
02:21:50,030 --> 02:21:51,950
Because the 3D concert was crazy.

2766
02:21:52,490 --> 02:21:54,170
Um, but I want to up that.

2767
02:21:55,050 --> 02:21:56,410
I want to do better than that.

2768
02:21:57,970 --> 02:22:01,330
I'll make it like, you know, the quality like I'm in the company.

2769
02:22:02,150 --> 02:22:03,890
Because I want to show like, you know, indies can do that too.

2770
02:22:04,610 --> 02:22:06,250
It's a lot of money, but we can do it too.

2771
02:22:09,530 --> 02:22:12,790
It's unfortunately a lot of money, but like, we can do it as well.

2772
02:22:16,150 --> 02:22:17,190
You sound drunk?

2773
02:22:17,350 --> 02:22:20,150
I'm just not mentally there.

2774
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:26,270
Like, ever since Malakiep...

2775
02:22:29,050 --> 02:22:31,090
Ever since Malakiep, guys...

2776
02:22:34,010 --> 02:22:36,830
Like, the person in my mind is like, dead.

2777
02:22:37,970 --> 02:22:42,350
The body has been rotting in my head for like, a couple of hours now.

2778
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:50,600
My broken from Malakiep.

2779
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:56,760
Oh my god, he fucking no jumping.

2780
02:22:58,500 --> 02:23:00,500
He anti-aired me.

2781
02:23:08,590 --> 02:23:09,970
Jesus Christ, okay.

2782
02:23:14,950 --> 02:23:15,790
Okay.

2783
02:23:16,470 --> 02:23:18,310
I think the worst part is like, I can't see anything.

2784
02:23:18,510 --> 02:23:19,950
Like, I actually...

2785
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:25,370
I legitimately just can't see anything.

2786
02:23:25,550 --> 02:23:26,110
I'm so blind.

2787
02:23:28,970 --> 02:23:29,870
Holy fuck.

2788
02:23:34,980 --> 02:23:35,580
Okay.

2789
02:23:38,980 --> 02:23:39,760
Oh my god.

2790
02:23:39,980 --> 02:23:43,500
I feel like there's like, a specific window where I can fight.

2791
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:44,320
Oh, nice.

2792
02:23:44,480 --> 02:23:46,760
Okay, before he stepped on my head, I got...

2793
02:23:47,260 --> 02:23:48,240
I got the hit.

2794
02:23:48,660 --> 02:23:48,780
All right.

2795
02:23:48,880 --> 02:23:49,960
This is where he...

2796
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:51,060
Okay, grabs me again.

2797
02:23:55,800 --> 02:23:58,220
Please, please, no!

2798
02:24:13,160 --> 02:24:20,340
Oh my god, oh my god, it's so delay, I don't like that, I don't like that.

2799
02:24:20,620 --> 02:24:22,440
Why is it so delay?

2800
02:24:22,820 --> 02:24:25,200
Why is it so mercy?

2801
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:26,320
Mercy!

2802
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:30,120
Oh my god!

2803
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:33,640
Uncle Uncle!

2804
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:43,860
It's always the delayed attacks.

2805
02:24:45,460 --> 02:24:49,860
Can we get something if we make it halfway to the girl?

2806
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:52,800
Nextie, thank you for the Akasufa.

2807
02:24:52,940 --> 02:24:53,340
Thank you.

2808
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:54,300
Thank you.

2809
02:24:55,500 --> 02:24:58,020
If we get halfway, I'll complete the game.

2810
02:25:00,080 --> 02:25:02,260
I'll complete the story bosses.

2811
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:10,120
Bro.

2812
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:16,880
Oh my god, I have never seen that move before.

2813
02:25:19,620 --> 02:25:21,980
Where did this move came from?

2814
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:27,340
Oh my god, stop.

2815
02:25:27,340 --> 02:25:27,840
You were it?

2816
02:25:28,380 --> 02:25:29,480
No, it's just good, it's just good.

2817
02:25:36,340 --> 02:25:39,140
And the charity didn't say I was going to complete Elden Ring.

2818
02:25:46,650 --> 02:25:50,150
Oh my god, some of these moves I like don't know.

2819
02:25:51,450 --> 02:25:54,610
Like I know he's done that before, but he just doesn't do it often.

2820
02:25:54,610 --> 02:25:56,750
But he like fucks with me.

2821
02:25:58,790 --> 02:26:00,770
God, and the queen fucks...

2822
02:26:00,770 --> 02:26:01,570
Married this man?

2823
02:26:02,170 --> 02:26:03,070
No, why did she...

2824
02:26:03,070 --> 02:26:03,570
And like...

2825
02:26:03,570 --> 02:26:05,530
Why did she like divorce him?

2826
02:26:05,850 --> 02:26:07,210
I don't understand.

2827
02:26:08,690 --> 02:26:10,770
Why would you ever divorce...

2828
02:26:10,770 --> 02:26:11,310
How?

2829
02:26:15,130 --> 02:26:17,030
Oh, but just kill me.

2830
02:26:17,210 --> 02:26:17,510
I...

2831
02:26:17,510 --> 02:26:18,770
I don't care anymore.

2832
02:26:19,330 --> 02:26:19,870
I...

2833
02:26:19,870 --> 02:26:21,710
I don't...

2834
02:26:21,710 --> 02:26:24,150
I don't care anymore.

2835
02:26:24,610 --> 02:26:27,310
Just kill me.

2836
02:26:27,790 --> 02:26:30,030
Okay, Ben, no chickening out now.

2837
02:26:34,490 --> 02:26:37,130
I can't believe she's divorced him.

2838
02:26:40,670 --> 02:26:42,210
Oh my god.

2839
02:26:42,370 --> 02:26:44,270
Yeah, she like ended up fucking herself.

2840
02:26:44,910 --> 02:26:46,350
She was like...

2841
02:26:46,350 --> 02:26:47,090
That's...

2842
02:26:47,090 --> 02:26:48,910
That must hurt your ego, you know?

2843
02:26:49,250 --> 02:26:51,590
Like that must really fucking hurt your ego.

2844
02:26:51,590 --> 02:26:52,690
Your wife leaves you.

2845
02:26:52,850 --> 02:26:54,170
And then she was like...

2846
02:26:54,170 --> 02:26:55,370
You were such a bad husband.

2847
02:26:55,570 --> 02:26:56,930
I'd rather just fuck myself.

2848
02:26:57,630 --> 02:26:58,110
Like...

2849
02:27:02,010 --> 02:27:03,310
You were such a...

2850
02:27:03,310 --> 02:27:05,070
You were such a bad husband.

2851
02:27:05,410 --> 02:27:06,470
Like the...

2852
02:27:06,470 --> 02:27:08,410
Like bed was terrible.

2853
02:27:08,930 --> 02:27:10,690
Like I'd rather just fuck myself.

2854
02:27:10,690 --> 02:27:11,370
Like...

2855
02:27:18,900 --> 02:27:19,580
Yeah.

2856
02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:22,960
Don't do that to Godfrey.

2857
02:27:27,970 --> 02:27:28,650
Yeah.

2858
02:27:30,790 --> 02:27:32,090
Finish the game.

2859
02:27:35,410 --> 02:27:36,090
Yeah.

2860
02:27:38,110 --> 02:27:40,250
Oh yeah, no, I know about the whole...

2861
02:27:40,250 --> 02:27:44,350
She created like a male version of herself as a consort.

2862
02:27:46,490 --> 02:27:47,550
Like I know that.

2863
02:27:47,770 --> 02:27:48,030
There were...

2864
02:27:48,030 --> 02:27:48,850
It was like...

2865
02:27:48,850 --> 02:27:51,550
Like the Elden Ring shorts kept popping up in my algorithm.

2866
02:27:52,530 --> 02:27:53,530
So I got curious.

2867
02:27:57,820 --> 02:27:58,300
Jesus.

2868
02:28:00,440 --> 02:28:01,560
Oh my god.

2869
02:28:01,740 --> 02:28:02,760
I thought I dodged it.

2870
02:28:02,900 --> 02:28:03,460
But I guess not.

2871
02:28:04,640 --> 02:28:05,600
Oh my god.

2872
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:08,280
Ramona, thank you for the Akasupa.

2873
02:28:08,520 --> 02:28:09,200
Thank you, thank you.

2874
02:28:09,340 --> 02:28:10,580
Time to beat the game.

2875
02:28:10,900 --> 02:28:11,320
Uh...

2876
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:12,620
Vinsta, thank you for the Akasupa.

2877
02:28:12,840 --> 02:28:13,560
Thank you, thank you.

2878
02:28:13,660 --> 02:28:14,660
Finish the game.

2879
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:15,580
It is...

2880
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:17,960
We get there?

2881
02:28:18,060 --> 02:28:18,720
Yeah, we got it.

2882
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:19,140
All right.

2883
02:28:19,460 --> 02:28:20,340
At least we can finish...

2884
02:28:20,340 --> 02:28:21,260
We'll finish the game.

2885
02:28:21,460 --> 02:28:23,540
I promise you guys we'll finish the game.

2886
02:28:23,920 --> 02:28:24,800
Not today.

2887
02:28:25,180 --> 02:28:26,840
This is my last boss today.

2888
02:28:27,340 --> 02:28:28,560
And then I...

2889
02:28:29,080 --> 02:28:30,720
And then I need to find a new...

2890
02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:33,260
New brain cell to inhabit in my mind.

2891
02:28:33,400 --> 02:28:33,960
I gotta clean...

2892
02:28:35,540 --> 02:28:37,340
I gotta clean the body first.

2893
02:28:39,960 --> 02:28:41,900
And then I'm gonna take like applications.

2894
02:28:42,500 --> 02:28:44,800
On who wants to be my new brain cell.

2895
02:28:58,520 --> 02:29:00,520
I need to like dodge more I feel like.

2896
02:29:02,940 --> 02:29:04,260
Like I need to play more slow.

2897
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:11,420
But yeah, cause he does so many moves.

2898
02:29:11,560 --> 02:29:12,560
And I feel like he just...

2899
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,240
He's gotta not be so greedy.

2900
02:29:17,220 --> 02:29:18,220
Oh, shit.

2901
02:29:19,860 --> 02:29:21,380
Oh yeah, that's me being greedy.

2902
02:29:21,580 --> 02:29:22,400
I could have dodged that.

2903
02:29:26,730 --> 02:29:27,450
Oh no.

2904
02:29:29,330 --> 02:29:29,650
Okay.

2905
02:29:35,420 --> 02:29:35,940
Okay.

2906
02:29:37,300 --> 02:29:37,820
Oh!

2907
02:29:38,380 --> 02:29:39,160
Wrong dodge.

2908
02:29:43,860 --> 02:29:44,620
Oh no.

2909
02:29:49,460 --> 02:29:50,440
No, no, no, no.

2910
02:29:50,960 --> 02:29:53,040
I spammed my attack too much.

2911
02:29:55,020 --> 02:29:55,540
Eh?

2912
02:29:58,660 --> 02:29:59,440
Oh no.

2913
02:30:00,580 --> 02:30:01,600
I thought he was gonna anti-air me.

2914
02:30:04,580 --> 02:30:05,600
He doesn't need to.

2915
02:30:06,060 --> 02:30:07,080
He doesn't...

2916
02:30:07,080 --> 02:30:09,020
He doesn't need to anti-air me.

2917
02:30:09,320 --> 02:30:10,480
He can just air...

2918
02:30:10,480 --> 02:30:11,600
Anti- me in general.

2919
02:30:12,380 --> 02:30:13,180
No, no, no, no, no!

2920
02:30:13,340 --> 02:30:13,620
No!

2921
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:14,420
Oh, fuck!

2922
02:30:26,340 --> 02:30:26,840
Okay.

2923
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:30,020
Okay.

2924
02:30:34,520 --> 02:30:36,240
I'll give time for appraisals.

2925
02:30:36,760 --> 02:30:38,360
Yeah, boss is just an anti.

2926
02:30:38,360 --> 02:30:39,020
Yeah.

2927
02:30:42,100 --> 02:30:43,700
I literally have...

2928
02:30:43,700 --> 02:30:45,600
My brain is up for rent right now.

2929
02:30:46,320 --> 02:30:48,280
The last tenant has died.

2930
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,540
All right, guys.

2931
02:30:55,960 --> 02:30:57,160
I have an idea.

2932
02:31:02,600 --> 02:31:03,740
Guys, it worked!

2933
02:31:06,460 --> 02:31:07,460
Holy shit.

2934
02:31:08,020 --> 02:31:08,380
It's okay.

2935
02:31:08,700 --> 02:31:10,220
At least that worked, you know?

2936
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:10,900
Like...

2937
02:31:10,900 --> 02:31:11,440
Oh, shit.

2938
02:31:11,560 --> 02:31:11,940
Goodbye.

2939
02:31:12,540 --> 02:31:15,700
Oh my god, he slam-ducked me.

2940
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:17,140
It's too late.

2941
02:31:19,060 --> 02:31:21,260
I got that one though, at least.

2942
02:31:21,940 --> 02:31:24,420
Okay, I might have got slam-ducked, but...

2943
02:31:24,920 --> 02:31:26,580
I got that working.

2944
02:31:29,440 --> 02:31:30,180
Oh no.

2945
02:31:30,480 --> 02:31:31,280
No, fuck.

2946
02:31:32,100 --> 02:31:32,480
No.

2947
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:33,100
No.

2948
02:31:33,260 --> 02:31:33,420
No.

2949
02:31:33,420 --> 02:31:34,640
Oh my god, please.

2950
02:31:34,820 --> 02:31:41,360
I'm pretty- I'm pretty sick.

2951
02:31:41,980 --> 02:31:42,120
Please.

2952
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:43,860
Holy shit.

2953
02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:45,140
That was crazy.

2954
02:31:45,500 --> 02:31:46,680
That was crazy.

2955
02:31:46,700 --> 02:31:48,580
I didn't think you could do that.

2956
02:31:49,220 --> 02:31:50,760
Holy shit.

2957
02:31:52,620 --> 02:31:53,320
Oh.

2958
02:32:00,630 --> 02:32:02,150
Oh my god.

2959
02:32:02,570 --> 02:32:04,270
Oh my god.

2960
02:32:05,110 --> 02:32:07,310
I don't want him to do that again.

2961
02:32:09,590 --> 02:32:11,750
Oh my god.

2962
02:32:11,910 --> 02:32:12,930
Oh my god.

2963
02:32:12,930 --> 02:32:15,130
Holy fuck.

2964
02:32:15,650 --> 02:32:17,950
Oh my god, he can't slam-duck on jellyfish.

2965
02:32:18,070 --> 02:32:18,570
That's okay.

2966
02:32:19,730 --> 02:32:21,670
He can't slam-duck on jellyfish.

2967
02:32:21,690 --> 02:32:22,690
He doesn't know how.

2968
02:32:25,250 --> 02:32:26,890
Oh my god.

2969
02:32:27,950 --> 02:32:29,430
Oh my god.

2970
02:32:29,430 --> 02:32:30,530
Oh my god.

2971
02:32:30,530 --> 02:32:30,610
I don't want them to do that again.

2972
02:32:33,550 --> 02:32:34,870
Oh my god.

2973
02:32:34,870 --> 02:32:36,030
Please I praise this.

2974
02:32:36,270 --> 02:32:36,890
I praise this.

2975
02:32:37,010 --> 02:32:38,430
I praise this.

2976
02:32:38,430 --> 02:32:39,070
Please.

2977
02:32:39,430 --> 02:32:41,270
I praise it before it's too late.

2978
02:32:41,930 --> 02:32:42,850
It's okay.

2979
02:32:46,310 --> 02:32:46,970
Please.

2980
02:32:47,170 --> 02:32:47,230
Oh.

2981
02:32:47,810 --> 02:32:48,110
Holy shit.

2982
02:32:52,050 --> 02:32:52,890
Oh!

2983
02:32:52,890 --> 02:32:54,490
I'll die for poison!

2984
02:32:55,010 --> 02:32:55,410
It's fine!

2985
02:32:55,890 --> 02:32:56,330
It's fine!

2986
02:32:57,170 --> 02:32:58,710
Please, it's time for poison!

2987
02:33:00,530 --> 02:33:05,190
I got it!

2988
02:33:05,810 --> 02:33:06,370
I got it!

2989
02:33:06,930 --> 02:33:07,610
Yay!

2990
02:33:09,470 --> 02:33:11,950
Caprio, we threw the slam dunk.

2991
02:33:12,750 --> 02:33:16,230
See, the streamer build has reigned supreme.

2992
02:33:16,230 --> 02:33:19,690
We did it, Jellyfish!

2993
02:33:20,530 --> 02:33:23,810
The concussion doesn't hurt nobody.

2994
02:33:24,830 --> 02:33:28,790
They can't concuss me when there's no one living in my head.

2995
02:33:30,910 --> 02:33:32,350
Well done.

2996
02:33:32,990 --> 02:33:36,070
The Jelly survived the whole time.

2997
02:33:36,770 --> 02:33:40,650
Can't concuss me when the person that lives there has died.

2998
02:33:43,990 --> 02:33:45,950
Oh my god!

2999
02:33:48,870 --> 02:33:49,750
Oh!

3000
02:33:50,370 --> 02:33:51,350
We did it!

3001
02:33:51,830 --> 02:33:52,290
Alright!

3002
02:33:52,770 --> 02:33:53,710
Do we do arcane?

3003
02:33:53,830 --> 02:33:55,030
Okay, what do we do, guys?

3004
02:33:55,670 --> 02:33:56,250
Yeah!

3005
02:33:58,330 --> 02:33:59,750
Oh my god!

3006
02:34:03,170 --> 02:34:06,330
No brain damage if no brain!

3007
02:34:06,830 --> 02:34:08,630
Wait, is the next boss the last one?

3008
02:34:09,670 --> 02:34:11,450
Is it the last one, chat?

3009
02:34:12,130 --> 02:34:12,530
Okay.

3010
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:13,250
Okay.

3011
02:34:13,730 --> 02:34:14,090
I'll...

3012
02:34:14,090 --> 02:34:14,890
You know what?

3013
02:34:14,990 --> 02:34:16,030
For you guys...

3014
02:34:16,030 --> 02:34:18,810
We'll finish... We'll finish Elden Ring today.

3015
02:34:18,810 --> 02:34:19,670
What?

3016
02:34:21,790 --> 02:34:22,810
For you guys...

3017
02:34:23,730 --> 02:34:25,030
We'll do it today.

3018
02:34:26,570 --> 02:34:27,730
We're gonna do arcane?

3019
02:34:27,870 --> 02:34:29,250
I don't think he bleeds, though.

3020
02:34:29,410 --> 02:34:29,850
That's the thing.

3021
02:34:30,770 --> 02:34:31,810
Can we do Dexterity?

3022
02:34:36,580 --> 02:34:37,100
Wait...

3023
02:34:37,100 --> 02:34:38,140
And then what?

3024
02:34:38,220 --> 02:34:38,680
Endurance?

3025
02:34:39,100 --> 02:34:39,680
How about this?

3026
02:34:39,860 --> 02:34:40,420
Is that fine?

3027
02:34:45,900 --> 02:34:46,420
Okay.

3028
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:50,540
Dexterity, is this okay?

3029
02:34:58,090 --> 02:34:58,530
Okay.

3030
02:34:59,710 --> 02:35:00,130
Okay.

3031
02:35:00,130 --> 02:35:00,230
Alright.

3032
02:35:01,650 --> 02:35:02,730
I guess it's time.

3033
02:35:03,370 --> 02:35:04,470
Wait, maybe I have enough...

3034
02:35:04,470 --> 02:35:05,630
Wait, actually, how much do I need?

3035
02:35:05,770 --> 02:35:06,650
To level up again?

3036
02:35:09,750 --> 02:35:10,190
Uh...

3037
02:35:10,190 --> 02:35:10,710
60.

3038
02:35:11,070 --> 02:35:11,990
Do I have the thing?

3039
02:35:21,740 --> 02:35:24,000
Okay, if I do one more, it should be enough.

3040
02:35:28,990 --> 02:35:29,430
Alright.

3041
02:35:31,690 --> 02:35:33,030
That should be enough now.

3042
02:35:33,850 --> 02:35:35,070
No, I can't use all of it.

3043
02:35:35,110 --> 02:35:36,710
Because if I use all of it, I don't even level up.

3044
02:35:36,830 --> 02:35:38,130
Alright, what do we get the last one?

3045
02:35:39,110 --> 02:35:40,470
Guys, the last one.

3046
02:35:50,210 --> 02:35:51,030
Oh, true!

3047
02:35:51,190 --> 02:35:52,430
I could munch my boss souls.

3048
02:35:52,590 --> 02:35:52,970
You're right.

3049
02:35:54,030 --> 02:35:54,530
You're right.

3050
02:35:54,530 --> 02:35:55,850
I don't have to fight Melania.

3051
02:35:56,290 --> 02:35:56,550
You're...

3052
02:35:59,890 --> 02:36:00,250
Yeah!

3053
02:36:01,550 --> 02:36:02,750
You're so right, guys.

3054
02:36:03,330 --> 02:36:04,830
Okay, we'll do Endurance after...

3055
02:36:04,830 --> 02:36:05,030
Okay.

3056
02:36:05,550 --> 02:36:06,050
You're right.

3057
02:36:06,130 --> 02:36:07,010
I can eat them all.

3058
02:36:07,230 --> 02:36:07,930
Say goodbye.

3059
02:36:07,930 --> 02:36:08,130
Bye.

3060
02:36:08,670 --> 02:36:10,870
Say goodbye to everybody, guys.

3061
02:36:13,670 --> 02:36:14,630
It's time...

3062
02:36:14,630 --> 02:36:16,590
To rage bait one last time.

3063
02:36:21,440 --> 02:36:22,060
Alright.

3064
02:36:25,640 --> 02:36:26,320
Okay.

3065
02:36:29,160 --> 02:36:29,500
Alright.

3066
02:36:29,960 --> 02:36:30,720
Let's see.

3067
02:36:33,140 --> 02:36:34,260
No better time.

3068
02:36:34,480 --> 02:36:34,880
You're right.

3069
02:36:35,100 --> 02:36:38,140
Okay, we'll do all of this first before I start my last rage bait.

3070
02:36:42,700 --> 02:36:44,100
Goodbye.

3071
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:45,520
Goodbye.

3072
02:36:45,660 --> 02:36:46,180
Fire giant.

3073
02:36:48,520 --> 02:36:49,920
Goodbye.

3074
02:36:50,880 --> 02:36:51,340
Wait.

3075
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:54,840
Goodbye.

3076
02:36:56,060 --> 02:36:57,240
Goodbye.

3077
02:37:06,660 --> 02:37:08,060
Crafted.

3078
02:37:08,060 --> 02:37:09,140
Yum-yum-yum!

3079
02:37:12,420 --> 02:37:16,580
Goodbye, Starscrooge!

3080
02:37:16,780 --> 02:37:19,560
Yum-yum-yum-yum!

3081
02:37:25,660 --> 02:37:29,740
Goodbye, Omen King!

3082
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:33,440
Yum-yum-yum-yum!

3083
02:37:35,080 --> 02:37:37,520
Tasty-tasty sauce!

3084
02:37:38,060 --> 02:37:40,800
Goodbye, Black Blade!

3085
02:37:42,060 --> 02:37:43,840
Yum-yum-yum!

3086
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:48,320
And finally, the last Rage Bait.

3087
02:37:49,700 --> 02:37:50,860
Aura Koralu!

3088
02:37:51,980 --> 02:37:54,540
Goodbye, Koralu!

3089
02:37:59,150 --> 02:38:01,930
I've broken many Elder Ring players today.

3090
02:38:02,470 --> 02:38:05,850
If I'm gonna get mine broken...

3091
02:38:10,190 --> 02:38:16,270
If I get mine broken, I'm bringing down as many Elder Ring players down with me.

3092
02:38:17,210 --> 02:38:19,390
Let that girl eat!

3093
02:38:20,350 --> 02:38:21,230
Eat glass!

3094
02:38:21,370 --> 02:38:22,310
Thank you, the Akka Soup!

3095
02:38:22,610 --> 02:38:23,530
Thank you, thank you!

3096
02:38:23,670 --> 02:38:26,070
Hopefully this helps, even though we didn't make it to the goal.

3097
02:38:26,070 --> 02:38:28,110
Ha ha ha ha!

3098
02:38:28,210 --> 02:38:29,110
Ha ha ha!

3099
02:38:29,950 --> 02:38:30,710
Ha ha ha!

3100
02:38:30,710 --> 02:38:30,710
Ha ha ha!

3101
02:38:30,710 --> 02:38:31,230
That's right!

3102
02:38:31,970 --> 02:38:32,650
Ha ha ha ha!

3103
02:38:33,410 --> 02:38:33,870
Ha ha ha ha!

3104
02:38:33,870 --> 02:38:33,870
Okay!

3105
02:38:35,050 --> 02:38:38,530
We do Vigor, Endurance, Dexterity.

3106
02:38:38,810 --> 02:38:39,570
Is that good?

3107
02:38:39,730 --> 02:38:40,250
Chet?

3108
02:38:41,370 --> 02:38:43,690
I am the God-Devouring Servers.

3109
02:38:43,810 --> 02:38:45,530
I am the one that devours.

3110
02:38:46,290 --> 02:38:47,310
Ha ha ha ha!

3111
02:38:49,690 --> 02:38:51,370
Is that good, or do we want more?

3112
02:38:55,980 --> 02:38:57,340
Ha ha ha ha!

3113
02:38:59,100 --> 02:39:00,700
I logged on!

3114
02:39:01,420 --> 02:39:02,220
Ha ha ha ha!

3115
02:39:02,460 --> 02:39:04,460
Which is like, that's it!

3116
02:39:04,600 --> 02:39:07,100
How could you eat all those souls?

3117
02:39:07,620 --> 02:39:08,960
Ha ha ha ha!

3118
02:39:09,780 --> 02:39:09,800
Ha ha ha ha!

3119
02:39:09,960 --> 02:39:10,920
Ha ha ha!

3120
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:14,720
Alright, here we go.

3121
02:39:15,520 --> 02:39:16,240
Ha ha ha!

3122
02:39:16,920 --> 02:39:19,500
After I ate all the souls, they left.

3123
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:23,420
Alright, this is it.

3124
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:26,800
Hello, I shall become the Eldenor.

3125
02:39:28,240 --> 02:39:28,680
Hello.

3126
02:39:29,440 --> 02:39:32,600
Oh yeah, I'm gonna kill the hus- Oh my god, that's so fucked up.

3127
02:39:32,660 --> 02:39:35,140
The ex-husband was there to protect the husband.

3128
02:39:35,360 --> 02:39:40,420
I forgot to- Ooh, I didn't realize I had 58k runes.

3129
02:39:41,840 --> 02:39:43,540
Mind break, where is the sweat?

3130
02:39:43,860 --> 02:39:45,160
Yo, thank you for the super chat.

3131
02:39:45,300 --> 02:39:47,440
I did not realize I had 58k.

3132
02:39:55,100 --> 02:39:56,920
That's actually so fucked up.

3133
02:39:57,760 --> 02:40:03,860
You force your ex-husband to protect your new husband.

3134
02:40:03,860 --> 02:40:04,700
Witches yourself.

3135
02:40:09,160 --> 02:40:10,360
Goodbye, runes.

3136
02:40:19,180 --> 02:40:20,340
Yeah, his wife, boyfriend.

3137
02:40:32,870 --> 02:40:33,390
Whoa.

3138
02:40:33,790 --> 02:40:35,550
It's causing my controller to vibrate.

3139
02:40:37,010 --> 02:40:39,330
God, that mac and cheese is gonna hit good tonight.

3140
02:40:43,590 --> 02:40:46,150
I should've let people know I was finishing Elden Ring today.

3141
02:40:46,770 --> 02:40:48,750
I didn't even know how much I had left.

3142
02:40:50,470 --> 02:40:53,830
He'll be like, man, how come we never got an Elden Ring stream after that?

3143
02:40:59,660 --> 02:41:00,080
Yeah.

3144
02:41:01,120 --> 02:41:03,420
I didn't even know, guys.

3145
02:41:04,100 --> 02:41:05,260
How close we were.

3146
02:41:11,020 --> 02:41:11,620
Alright.

3147
02:41:12,580 --> 02:41:13,120
Hello.

3148
02:41:16,340 --> 02:41:16,940
Okay.

3149
02:41:18,900 --> 02:41:20,580
Can you bleed anyway?

3150
02:41:20,800 --> 02:41:21,420
I don't even know.

3151
02:41:23,320 --> 02:41:24,180
This is it, Dragooops.

3152
02:41:24,940 --> 02:41:26,120
The second final fight.

3153
02:41:26,220 --> 02:41:28,400
You think I don't know he turns into a flying dragon?

3154
02:41:28,400 --> 02:41:29,320
I didn't like...

3155
02:41:29,320 --> 02:41:30,160
Ha ha ha ha.

3156
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:33,820
Guys, I know what happens afterwards.

3157
02:41:40,910 --> 02:41:41,470
Okay.

3158
02:41:44,710 --> 02:41:45,730
Oh, shit.

3159
02:41:48,010 --> 02:41:49,670
No, I know he's immune to bleed.

3160
02:41:50,710 --> 02:41:52,070
Oh my god.

3161
02:41:53,370 --> 02:41:53,750
It's okay.

3162
02:41:53,830 --> 02:41:54,470
I have an army.

3163
02:41:55,950 --> 02:41:57,090
They're not immune to poison.

3164
02:42:00,370 --> 02:42:00,930
Whoa.

3165
02:42:09,920 --> 02:42:10,640
Okay.

3166
02:42:12,980 --> 02:42:14,680
The hardest part is...

3167
02:42:14,680 --> 02:42:16,000
...the last boss, though.

3168
02:42:16,600 --> 02:42:17,460
For sure.

3169
02:42:21,100 --> 02:42:21,940
It's fine.

3170
02:42:25,880 --> 02:42:27,060
Holy shit.

3171
02:42:27,980 --> 02:42:28,680
Okay.

3172
02:42:34,260 --> 02:42:34,980
Oh!

3173
02:42:41,210 --> 02:42:42,450
Oh my god.

3174
02:42:42,750 --> 02:42:44,230
How was I supposed to do?

3175
02:42:49,640 --> 02:42:50,360
Actually...

3176
02:42:50,360 --> 02:42:54,000
I never get critical hit because I'm too stupid.

3177
02:43:23,310 --> 02:43:26,110
I'm too scared.

3178
02:43:27,070 --> 02:43:30,350
All right, the actual fight time.

3179
02:43:31,650 --> 02:43:34,310
Oh my god, this is the actual fight.

3180
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:40,940
We need more appraisals.

3181
02:43:47,980 --> 02:43:49,720
All right, the real fight.

3182
02:44:05,230 --> 02:44:07,020
All right, here he goes.

3183
02:44:08,280 --> 02:44:09,840
Hello, little guy.

3184
02:44:17,260 --> 02:44:18,320
Here comes daddy.

3185
02:44:19,620 --> 02:44:21,220
What even is he, anyway?

3186
02:44:23,180 --> 02:44:23,880
All right.

3187
02:44:27,400 --> 02:44:28,360
Lore droppers.

3188
02:44:28,620 --> 02:44:29,520
Drop the lore.

3189
02:44:30,020 --> 02:44:31,720
There was a name for you guys, right?

3190
02:44:34,120 --> 02:44:34,600
Loremen.

3191
02:44:37,220 --> 02:44:38,180
People of the lore.

3192
02:44:38,360 --> 02:44:39,000
Oh yeah, there is.

3193
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:39,580
Nerds.

3194
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:40,400
Nerds!

3195
02:44:41,340 --> 02:44:42,360
Drop the lore.

3196
02:44:46,960 --> 02:44:48,300
He's Jesus.

3197
02:44:56,980 --> 02:44:57,740
Hello.

3198
02:44:58,320 --> 02:45:00,260
I'm so tiny compared to him.

3199
02:45:14,840 --> 02:45:16,340
Am I doing it?

3200
02:45:18,920 --> 02:45:22,180
Am I- Am I doing it?

3201
02:45:22,340 --> 02:45:23,400
I can't tell.

3202
02:45:32,150 --> 02:45:35,010
Guys, I don't think I was doing it there.

3203
02:45:35,590 --> 02:45:36,890
Oh my god.

3204
02:45:41,530 --> 02:45:42,350
Am I doing it?

3205
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:49,020
What am I...

3206
02:45:50,560 --> 02:45:51,520
Like, what?

3207
02:45:52,480 --> 02:45:54,240
Oh my god.

3208
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:57,000
Oh my god.

3209
02:46:00,160 --> 02:46:02,260
I think I fucked that up.

3210
02:46:08,180 --> 02:46:08,820
Okay.

3211
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:11,700
I don't think that was how I was supposed to ride.

3212
02:46:12,160 --> 02:46:12,600
Torrent.

3213
02:46:18,200 --> 02:46:19,000
Okay.

3214
02:46:22,100 --> 02:46:23,860
Oh, I thought I could dodge that.

3215
02:46:25,220 --> 02:46:26,520
He's so far.

3216
02:46:26,940 --> 02:46:28,760
Torrent's so gone now.

3217
02:46:29,040 --> 02:46:29,960
Oh my god.

3218
02:46:29,980 --> 02:46:32,080
I just made it to you.

3219
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:35,440
So fucked up.

3220
02:46:37,160 --> 02:46:39,200
I just got to you, too.

3221
02:46:42,920 --> 02:46:45,760
How is my jellyfish- Oh, he's gonna die here.

3222
02:46:46,140 --> 02:46:47,800
I'm gonna save that and then he's gonna die here.

3223
02:46:48,560 --> 02:46:49,760
Why is this attack?

3224
02:46:50,620 --> 02:46:52,300
How is this gonna fuck me up?

3225
02:46:52,480 --> 02:46:53,300
That's the question.

3226
02:46:55,380 --> 02:46:55,980
Oh.

3227
02:46:57,760 --> 02:46:58,900
Oh, that's out.

3228
02:47:08,280 --> 02:47:08,880
Okay.

3229
02:47:12,860 --> 02:47:14,180
I just run away?

3230
02:47:16,420 --> 02:47:17,520
Oh, I see.

3231
02:47:20,120 --> 02:47:21,920
I shall kill the space.

3232
02:47:23,360 --> 02:47:24,720
Oh my god.

3233
02:47:25,860 --> 02:47:26,500
What?

3234
02:47:29,490 --> 02:47:32,530
The three- I- He- The timing fucked me up.

3235
02:47:34,170 --> 02:47:35,370
Oh my god.

3236
02:47:35,770 --> 02:47:36,050
Oh my god.

3237
02:47:36,150 --> 02:47:39,510
I messed up one timing and then it was over for me.

3238
02:47:40,010 --> 02:47:41,010
It was over.

3239
02:47:43,610 --> 02:47:44,130
Yeah.

3240
02:47:44,470 --> 02:47:47,330
I messed up that timing and then it messed up all my other timing.

3241
02:47:47,330 --> 02:47:48,310
Alright, it's time.

3242
02:47:48,750 --> 02:47:49,490
It's time.

3243
02:47:50,150 --> 02:47:50,290
It's time.

3244
02:47:50,290 --> 02:47:50,590
All in.

3245
02:47:53,330 --> 02:47:54,490
All in, guys.

3246
02:47:55,230 --> 02:47:56,170
This is it.

3247
02:47:56,370 --> 02:47:57,450
This is our final stat.

3248
02:47:58,430 --> 02:48:00,510
This is our final stat, everyone.

3249
02:48:00,510 --> 02:48:00,990
What?

3250
02:48:05,830 --> 02:48:07,430
We're going all in.

3251
02:48:08,910 --> 02:48:09,950
All of us.

3252
02:48:10,150 --> 02:48:10,890
Right here.

3253
02:48:11,370 --> 02:48:13,250
We shall reign supreme.

3254
02:48:17,050 --> 02:48:18,550
Our final stat.

3255
02:48:22,930 --> 02:48:24,210
Oh wait, what?

3256
02:48:28,950 --> 02:48:30,170
Where's Maiden?

3257
02:48:31,390 --> 02:48:32,230
Guide.

3258
02:48:34,490 --> 02:48:34,910
Guide.

3259
02:48:36,930 --> 02:48:37,770
Alright.

3260
02:48:38,850 --> 02:48:40,530
And then the last one.

3261
02:48:44,310 --> 02:48:45,690
This is our final stat.

3262
02:48:46,550 --> 02:48:47,650
Right here.

3263
02:48:49,450 --> 02:48:50,230
We did it.

3264
02:48:50,310 --> 02:48:51,250
We're gonna do it.

3265
02:48:54,810 --> 02:48:56,050
Together, Dragoons.

3266
02:48:56,350 --> 02:48:59,890
Me, you and I, and the streamer build.

3267
02:49:03,490 --> 02:49:04,650
This is it.

3268
02:49:10,670 --> 02:49:13,010
We shall prove them all.

3269
02:49:13,290 --> 02:49:15,870
The power of the streamer build, everyone.

3270
02:49:17,570 --> 02:49:18,810
Oh my god.

3271
02:49:19,130 --> 02:49:21,050
He used a new attack right away.

3272
02:49:21,270 --> 02:49:22,710
I have never seen that attack.

3273
02:49:22,990 --> 02:49:24,130
I mean, not new, sorry.

3274
02:49:24,130 --> 02:49:26,430
I have not seen him use that so early before.

3275
02:49:29,710 --> 02:49:30,670
Holy shit.

3276
02:49:33,130 --> 02:49:34,550
Oh my god.

3277
02:49:35,850 --> 02:49:37,070
Guys, I'm not okay.

3278
02:49:38,630 --> 02:49:41,570
I think my first attempt might be my best attempt.

3279
02:49:44,710 --> 02:49:45,650
Oh my god.

3280
02:49:45,790 --> 02:49:45,810
Oh my god.

3281
02:49:45,810 --> 02:49:46,670
I'm so sorry, child.

3282
02:49:46,790 --> 02:49:48,310
I am so sorry, child.

3283
02:49:49,430 --> 02:49:50,650
I'm so sorry.

3284
02:49:52,690 --> 02:49:55,790
You lived longer in the other tribe.

3285
02:50:03,150 --> 02:50:04,750
Oh my god.

3286
02:50:04,770 --> 02:50:05,170
Oh my god.

3287
02:50:05,170 --> 02:50:05,830
I'm dead.

3288
02:50:07,150 --> 02:50:08,330
I'm so dead.

3289
02:50:16,700 --> 02:50:17,340
Okay.

3290
02:50:17,680 --> 02:50:18,620
That's a deleted attack.

3291
02:50:20,060 --> 02:50:20,700
Okay.

3292
02:50:21,020 --> 02:50:21,820
At least I know.

3293
02:50:27,650 --> 02:50:29,970
Oh, he came back for me!

3294
02:50:34,090 --> 02:50:38,930
He jumped up at my jellyfish and then came back to me.

3295
02:50:39,290 --> 02:50:40,430
Oh my god.

3296
02:50:40,530 --> 02:50:41,970
I got baited so hard.

3297
02:50:42,710 --> 02:50:43,650
Oh my god.

3298
02:50:43,910 --> 02:50:44,850
I got baited.

3299
02:50:47,350 --> 02:50:48,970
I have to blow my nose.

3300
02:50:49,450 --> 02:50:49,990
All right.

3301
02:50:54,910 --> 02:50:56,070
Holy shit.

3302
02:50:59,490 --> 02:51:00,310
All right.

3303
02:51:00,450 --> 02:51:00,970
Here we go.

3304
02:51:02,350 --> 02:51:03,730
What about DLC?

3305
02:51:04,190 --> 02:51:05,690
Think of the content, man.

3306
02:51:05,930 --> 02:51:06,030
Min.

3307
02:51:07,370 --> 02:51:08,830
That's for another charity goal.

3308
02:51:34,550 --> 02:51:36,290
Oh my god.

3309
02:51:39,890 --> 02:51:41,430
Oh my god.

3310
02:51:45,800 --> 02:51:46,840
Oh, shit.

3311
02:51:49,800 --> 02:51:50,440
Okay.

3312
02:51:52,540 --> 02:51:53,740
Got a healer.

3313
02:51:57,880 --> 02:51:58,300
Nice.

3314
02:52:00,800 --> 02:52:01,620
Wait, what is that?

3315
02:52:01,700 --> 02:52:02,120
What is that?

3316
02:52:05,470 --> 02:52:06,850
Oh, the delay.

3317
02:52:08,210 --> 02:52:09,730
I feel like he does like...

3318
02:52:09,730 --> 02:52:11,870
This guy does so many delay attacks.

3319
02:52:12,830 --> 02:52:13,250
It's...

3320
02:52:13,250 --> 02:52:14,570
He fucks with me so much.

3321
02:52:24,580 --> 02:52:24,980
Okay.

3322
02:52:27,320 --> 02:52:28,460
Oh, wait, what?

3323
02:52:29,500 --> 02:52:30,300
Oh, there's...

3324
02:52:30,300 --> 02:52:30,820
That's a grid.

3325
02:52:31,040 --> 02:52:31,260
Okay.

3326
02:52:32,100 --> 02:52:32,760
That's a grid.

3327
02:52:32,880 --> 02:52:33,520
Okay, now I know.

3328
02:52:38,640 --> 02:52:40,980
Oh my god, I got my first critical hit thing.

3329
02:52:45,880 --> 02:52:48,040
I've never been so lucky before.

3330
02:52:53,670 --> 02:52:54,230
What?

3331
02:52:54,630 --> 02:52:55,190
Okay.

3332
02:52:55,950 --> 02:52:56,790
That was cute.

3333
02:52:57,010 --> 02:52:58,210
I thought I hit that.

3334
02:52:58,850 --> 02:52:59,570
That sucks.

3335
02:53:03,270 --> 02:53:04,330
I hit that.

3336
02:53:06,250 --> 02:53:07,410
I didn't hit that.

3337
02:53:07,810 --> 02:53:09,490
Oh my god, I didn't hit that either.

3338
02:53:14,180 --> 02:53:15,120
Okay, that's good.

3339
02:53:16,600 --> 02:53:18,180
Just focus on my child.

3340
02:53:21,640 --> 02:53:22,040
Okay.

3341
02:53:22,720 --> 02:53:23,120
Okay.

3342
02:53:23,280 --> 02:53:23,680
Okay, I can't die.

3343
02:53:23,780 --> 02:53:24,140
Okay, guys.

3344
02:53:24,660 --> 02:53:25,040
All right.

3345
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:27,280
It's appraisal time.

3346
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:32,400
Oh!

3347
02:53:35,580 --> 02:53:37,100
All right, we're gonna give a little stall.

3348
02:53:37,400 --> 02:53:39,420
We're gonna give a little stall before we go straight in.

3349
02:53:44,400 --> 02:53:47,080
I don't need to score in there.

3350
02:53:54,410 --> 02:53:55,830
Oh my god.

3351
02:53:56,830 --> 02:53:57,790
He is so...

3352
02:53:57,790 --> 02:53:58,610
Oh my god.

3353
02:53:58,950 --> 02:54:00,910
What did he do to my jellyfish?

3354
02:54:07,540 --> 02:54:08,240
Okay.

3355
02:54:09,300 --> 02:54:11,500
Oh, my jellyfish was like full HP.

3356
02:54:15,860 --> 02:54:16,560
What?

3357
02:54:17,240 --> 02:54:17,880
Okay.

3358
02:54:18,300 --> 02:54:19,700
I don't know how to dodge that.

3359
02:54:20,320 --> 02:54:21,160
All right, goodbye.

3360
02:54:27,500 --> 02:54:29,740
I don't need to charge it to the distance.

3361
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:30,100
Okay.

3362
02:54:32,260 --> 02:54:33,640
Goodbye, Torrent.

3363
02:54:37,560 --> 02:54:40,180
I don't know how to use Torrent effectively, guys.

3364
02:54:40,800 --> 02:54:43,140
He was not there for the longest time.

3365
02:54:51,820 --> 02:54:53,060
Oh my god.

3366
02:54:59,090 --> 02:55:00,230
Goodbye, Torrent.

3367
02:55:07,020 --> 02:55:07,520
Wait.

3368
02:55:07,980 --> 02:55:08,360
No.

3369
02:55:12,820 --> 02:55:13,340
No!

3370
02:55:17,160 --> 02:55:17,680
This!

3371
02:55:23,400 --> 02:55:23,920
Okay.

3372
02:55:26,480 --> 02:55:27,260
It's fine.

3373
02:55:28,620 --> 02:55:30,100
Oh, I could jump the circles?

3374
02:55:30,360 --> 02:55:31,400
Okay, that's good to know.

3375
02:55:31,720 --> 02:55:33,000
Because I definitely did not know.

3376
02:55:33,060 --> 02:55:33,800
Oh my god.

3377
02:55:33,940 --> 02:55:35,180
Okay, I swear to god, I pressed circles.

3378
02:55:39,180 --> 02:55:40,580
I'll never be able to hit him.

3379
02:55:50,520 --> 02:55:50,920
Okay.

3380
02:55:51,220 --> 02:55:52,560
I know the timing for that.

3381
02:55:53,280 --> 02:55:53,920
I think.

3382
02:55:55,020 --> 02:55:56,800
I'm gonna say that and I'm gonna fuck it up.

3383
02:55:57,340 --> 02:55:58,720
I couldn't feel it.

3384
02:55:59,960 --> 02:56:00,860
Oh my god.

3385
02:56:01,780 --> 02:56:03,300
I don't know the timing for that.

3386
02:56:03,400 --> 02:56:03,820
I don't...

3387
02:56:03,820 --> 02:56:04,200
Oh!

3388
02:56:05,960 --> 02:56:07,860
I don't know the timing for that.

3389
02:56:07,860 --> 02:56:10,020
It's so slow!

3390
02:56:11,220 --> 02:56:12,060
It's so slow!

3391
02:56:16,610 --> 02:56:16,730
It's so slow!

3392
02:56:16,730 --> 02:56:17,170
Yeah.

3393
02:56:19,930 --> 02:56:22,030
That timing is so slow.

3394
02:56:23,390 --> 02:56:25,190
Do I have Holy Resist Talisman?

3395
02:56:25,310 --> 02:56:25,750
I do!

3396
02:56:26,150 --> 02:56:28,390
Because I haven't looked at my stuff in a long time.

3397
02:56:32,510 --> 02:56:33,010
No.

3398
02:56:33,390 --> 02:56:33,710
Alright.

3399
02:56:40,560 --> 02:56:41,840
There we go.

3400
02:56:43,180 --> 02:56:44,180
Come on, guys.

3401
02:56:44,800 --> 02:56:46,040
Dragoons strong together.

3402
02:56:54,730 --> 02:56:56,450
Dragoons strong together!

3403
02:56:59,970 --> 02:57:02,030
The streamer build hell supreme!

3404
02:57:06,340 --> 02:57:06,780
Guys!

3405
02:57:07,240 --> 02:57:08,580
For the streamer build!

3406
02:57:08,960 --> 02:57:09,540
Oh, shit!

3407
02:57:14,540 --> 02:57:15,480
Oh my god.

3408
02:57:15,820 --> 02:57:16,820
Okay, that one was on me.

3409
02:57:17,800 --> 02:57:18,340
I got greedy.

3410
02:57:18,760 --> 02:57:20,100
I got so greedy there.

3411
02:57:22,280 --> 02:57:23,120
Holy shit!

3412
02:57:23,140 --> 02:57:25,060
That was the fastest I've ever died of them.

3413
02:57:25,160 --> 02:57:26,280
I got so greedy.

3414
02:57:29,120 --> 02:57:31,780
I got greedy once and it fucked me up.

3415
02:57:31,900 --> 02:57:32,700
It fucked me over.

3416
02:57:34,840 --> 02:57:38,000
No, I know you can't bleed, but I don't really have any other weapon.

3417
02:57:38,260 --> 02:57:39,440
This is my best weapon.

3418
02:57:41,100 --> 02:57:42,680
I could put poison on.

3419
02:57:46,850 --> 02:57:48,350
Wait, I could...

3420
02:57:48,350 --> 02:57:49,080
I'm gonna change my...

3421
02:57:51,510 --> 02:57:52,090
Um...

3422
02:57:52,090 --> 02:57:52,640
I'll put...

3423
02:57:55,680 --> 02:57:56,720
Put that here.

3424
02:58:09,820 --> 02:58:11,460
Guess I don't have a frost sword.

3425
02:58:11,600 --> 02:58:12,260
It's too late.

3426
02:58:20,590 --> 02:58:22,010
Okay, that's fine.

3427
02:58:26,080 --> 02:58:26,890
Oh no.

3428
02:58:30,450 --> 02:58:31,360
This is bad.

3429
02:58:38,090 --> 02:58:39,100
This is so bad.

3430
02:58:41,530 --> 02:58:42,060
Okay.

3431
02:58:53,640 --> 02:58:54,500
Oh, shit!

3432
02:58:59,860 --> 02:59:00,520
Yeah.

3433
02:59:03,590 --> 02:59:04,620
Oh my god.

3434
02:59:07,150 --> 02:59:07,680
Okay.

3435
02:59:10,730 --> 02:59:11,260
Fuck.

3436
02:59:18,240 --> 02:59:19,080
No.

3437
02:59:19,420 --> 02:59:19,660
No!

3438
02:59:19,660 --> 02:59:20,100
Oh the...

3439
02:59:20,100 --> 02:59:20,820
The strength!

3440
02:59:25,230 --> 02:59:25,670
Okay.

3441
02:59:28,450 --> 02:59:30,330
Are you serious you fucker?

3442
02:59:30,910 --> 02:59:32,450
Oh my god.

3443
02:59:32,870 --> 02:59:33,930
That fucking sucked.

3444
02:59:36,830 --> 02:59:38,170
I hate my depth perception.

3445
02:59:40,750 --> 02:59:42,090
Oh, no!

3446
02:59:47,240 --> 02:59:48,260
That was close.

3447
02:59:49,680 --> 02:59:50,640
That was close.

3448
02:59:58,570 --> 03:00:03,790
Not get the, wait, is that not the... no this is, this is the poison.

3449
03:00:05,370 --> 03:00:07,830
Wait, actually, it's 175.

3450
03:00:13,460 --> 03:00:16,440
Should I use the poison blade, or no?

3451
03:00:16,680 --> 03:00:18,460
Or keep the rivers of blood?

3452
03:00:21,860 --> 03:00:22,300
Okay.

3453
03:00:22,300 --> 03:00:23,220
I don't think I can.

3454
03:00:23,520 --> 03:00:24,600
Do I have upgrades?

3455
03:00:24,980 --> 03:00:27,340
Do I have enough Sombra stones?

3456
03:00:28,800 --> 03:00:30,280
No, I don't have any more stones.

3457
03:00:31,080 --> 03:00:32,380
I used them all up.

3458
03:00:32,820 --> 03:00:34,060
I was so hungry.

3459
03:00:35,680 --> 03:00:40,040
I was so hungry, guys.

3460
03:00:45,870 --> 03:00:46,690
I don't know.

3461
03:00:47,390 --> 03:00:48,130
I think it is.

3462
03:00:48,290 --> 03:00:50,090
This one is, like, really...

3463
03:00:50,090 --> 03:00:54,990
I know I just used it, but I was like... I don't know if this is worth it.

3464
03:00:55,610 --> 03:00:57,810
I feel like... I'm just going to swap back.

3465
03:00:59,490 --> 03:01:01,030
I like the other ability more.

3466
03:01:17,990 --> 03:01:18,370
Alright.

3467
03:01:24,980 --> 03:01:26,100
Oh my god!

3468
03:01:27,440 --> 03:01:30,360
I feel like the amount of time I said it does that, and I just forgot.

3469
03:01:32,260 --> 03:01:33,380
I just forgot.

3470
03:01:33,660 --> 03:01:34,900
I was like, it does that?

3471
03:01:35,040 --> 03:01:38,620
And then he does it, like, 20 times, and I'm still like, it does that, guys?

3472
03:01:53,550 --> 03:01:55,550
Oh my god, I literally rolled into it.

3473
03:01:55,630 --> 03:01:55,810
Oh!

3474
03:02:03,530 --> 03:02:04,810
Oh my god, I'm rolling into it.

3475
03:02:08,370 --> 03:02:09,690
Oh my god!

3476
03:02:16,090 --> 03:02:16,650
Please.

3477
03:02:17,510 --> 03:02:19,110
Please, I don't deserve this.

3478
03:02:19,670 --> 03:02:21,550
I don't deserve this abuse.

3479
03:02:22,930 --> 03:02:24,470
What is he trying to hit?

3480
03:02:39,030 --> 03:02:40,590
Oh my god!

3481
03:02:42,790 --> 03:02:44,250
That fucking range.

3482
03:02:44,830 --> 03:02:45,990
Is better to break skill?

3483
03:02:46,310 --> 03:02:46,770
Sans?

3484
03:02:46,990 --> 03:02:47,870
Okay, I'll try that.

3485
03:02:48,810 --> 03:02:51,250
I'll try... I'll try... I'll swap my swords.

3486
03:02:53,070 --> 03:02:55,070
I'll start... I'll swap it one more time.

3487
03:02:56,150 --> 03:02:56,270
Alright.

3488
03:02:58,950 --> 03:03:00,970
That is such a fucking huge range.

3489
03:03:07,160 --> 03:03:09,100
Yeah, he instant transmissioned me.

3490
03:03:14,090 --> 03:03:16,630
You know what would make this bot easier?

3491
03:03:17,250 --> 03:03:21,310
Unlocking the exclusive Dill Keeper lane by using the link in the pin chat.

3492
03:03:21,530 --> 03:03:24,670
Sorry to get only 364 at night, night.

3493
03:03:24,910 --> 03:03:27,450
Solid Snake, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you!

3494
03:03:28,110 --> 03:03:29,790
I really appreciate it.

3495
03:03:29,890 --> 03:03:31,190
Thanks for helping me, Shell.

3496
03:03:38,760 --> 03:03:39,340
Alright.

3497
03:03:50,860 --> 03:03:51,300
Yeah.

3498
03:03:51,720 --> 03:03:54,460
Guys, I think I lost all the drag wounds that were appraising me.

3499
03:03:54,860 --> 03:03:56,940
I think... I think...

3500
03:03:59,620 --> 03:04:01,480
I think they're all gods.

3501
03:04:02,540 --> 03:04:04,180
They've all died in the war.

3502
03:04:06,500 --> 03:04:09,680
I've been waiting for the appraisal for 60 years.

3503
03:04:09,940 --> 03:04:11,180
They've all died.

3504
03:04:11,600 --> 03:04:13,480
The women, the children, the elderly.

3505
03:04:14,280 --> 03:04:16,000
All the men, God.

3506
03:04:20,220 --> 03:04:22,060
Thank you for your service.

3507
03:04:31,140 --> 03:04:33,920
They're so tired.

3508
03:04:34,040 --> 03:04:36,240
We're running out of drag...

3509
03:04:36,240 --> 03:04:37,160
They all died.

3510
03:04:41,580 --> 03:04:46,540
I am fighting the one drag wound so strong.

3511
03:04:49,140 --> 03:04:49,820
Please.

3512
03:04:50,420 --> 03:04:50,480
Please.

3513
03:04:50,480 --> 03:04:51,680
We need more children.

3514
03:04:52,200 --> 03:04:55,460
How do we make more children when all of them are dead?

3515
03:04:57,280 --> 03:04:58,900
I'm so tired, bot.

3516
03:05:03,470 --> 03:05:04,170
Oh, shit.

3517
03:05:05,270 --> 03:05:05,810
Oh, shit.

3518
03:05:06,010 --> 03:05:06,850
He's slowly walking.

3519
03:05:07,010 --> 03:05:07,670
Oh, my God.

3520
03:05:08,010 --> 03:05:08,450
Oh, my God.

3521
03:05:08,530 --> 03:05:08,790
Never mind.

3522
03:05:08,910 --> 03:05:10,310
He's not slowly walking over anymore.

3523
03:05:18,790 --> 03:05:19,490
Oh, my God.

3524
03:05:19,690 --> 03:05:20,870
I hate that.

3525
03:05:21,010 --> 03:05:21,610
I hate that.

3526
03:05:21,750 --> 03:05:22,810
Oh, my God.

3527
03:05:22,810 --> 03:05:26,890
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

3528
03:05:26,890 --> 03:05:28,750
I've never seen that move before.

3529
03:05:32,350 --> 03:05:33,630
Oh, my God.

3530
03:05:33,810 --> 03:05:34,470
That's new.

3531
03:05:54,950 --> 03:05:55,630
Jesus.

3532
03:05:56,230 --> 03:05:56,890
He is so...

3533
03:05:56,890 --> 03:05:58,910
I can't get to his other form anymore.

3534
03:06:00,270 --> 03:06:01,890
I feel like he's learning.

3535
03:06:06,050 --> 03:06:07,230
Oh, my God.

3536
03:06:13,110 --> 03:06:14,550
I'm trying to...

3537
03:06:16,820 --> 03:06:17,750
Jesus Christ.

3538
03:06:18,110 --> 03:06:19,230
Holy shit.

3539
03:06:21,090 --> 03:06:21,990
Oh, wait.

3540
03:06:22,070 --> 03:06:23,030
I'm gonna get water real quick.

3541
03:06:23,190 --> 03:06:23,850
I ran out of water.

3542
03:06:24,350 --> 03:06:25,450
I'll try it.

3543
03:06:29,950 --> 03:06:32,330
I got up and I was like...

3544
03:06:41,190 --> 03:06:42,750
I got the water.

3545
03:06:47,630 --> 03:06:48,150
Okay.

3546
03:06:48,150 --> 03:06:48,870
I'm locking in.

3547
03:06:51,690 --> 03:06:52,310
Oh.

3548
03:06:54,630 --> 03:06:55,870
I'm locking in now.

3549
03:06:56,890 --> 03:06:58,790
I got at least...

3550
03:06:59,230 --> 03:07:00,490
I got to get my groove back.

3551
03:07:03,920 --> 03:07:06,220
I feel like if I don't sink, I do better.

3552
03:07:08,700 --> 03:07:09,840
I'll put some new ones.

3553
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:10,760
Don't worry, I got you.

3554
03:07:14,640 --> 03:07:15,340
There you go.

3555
03:07:16,500 --> 03:07:17,540
I'm getting lazier.

3556
03:07:17,540 --> 03:07:17,560
There.

3557
03:07:19,780 --> 03:07:21,240
The one appraisal.

3558
03:07:21,240 --> 03:07:21,460
Don't worry.

3559
03:07:21,620 --> 03:07:22,060
I got you.

3560
03:07:22,520 --> 03:07:23,440
I say yes.

3561
03:07:23,520 --> 03:07:25,160
I put one appraisal down.

3562
03:07:35,130 --> 03:07:35,630
Okay.

3563
03:07:36,070 --> 03:07:36,850
I'm locking in now.

3564
03:07:49,390 --> 03:07:49,890
Jesus.

3565
03:07:51,190 --> 03:07:53,120
I need to remember that that is the...

3566
03:07:54,390 --> 03:07:55,210
Oh, my God.

3567
03:07:55,270 --> 03:07:56,430
He just anti-aired me.

3568
03:07:56,570 --> 03:07:57,170
Just like that.

3569
03:07:58,990 --> 03:07:59,490
Jesus.

3570
03:08:08,170 --> 03:08:08,650
Okay.

3571
03:08:13,270 --> 03:08:13,750
What?

3572
03:08:13,970 --> 03:08:14,770
I swear to God.

3573
03:08:15,290 --> 03:08:17,910
I don't see like half of the moves that he's doing.

3574
03:08:18,610 --> 03:08:20,250
Like he's actually using new stuff.

3575
03:08:22,710 --> 03:08:23,630
No, no, no, no, no.

3576
03:08:24,530 --> 03:08:25,010
Nice.

3577
03:08:26,950 --> 03:08:27,830
Okay, that's good.

3578
03:08:33,040 --> 03:08:34,500
Are you fucking kidding me?

3579
03:08:37,400 --> 03:08:38,320
Okay.

3580
03:08:38,440 --> 03:08:38,740
Okay, nice.

3581
03:08:39,380 --> 03:08:40,260
Not at me.

3582
03:08:48,160 --> 03:08:50,260
What is that delay?

3583
03:08:54,620 --> 03:09:00,500
What the fu- Oh, my God.

3584
03:09:01,600 --> 03:09:03,220
That's actually bullshit.

3585
03:09:03,220 --> 03:09:03,860
Bullshit.

3586
03:09:07,760 --> 03:09:08,320
I...

3587
03:09:08,320 --> 03:09:10,840
Oh, my God.

3588
03:09:12,640 --> 03:09:14,980
He had so many delays.

3589
03:09:15,600 --> 03:09:16,160
There's so...

3590
03:09:16,160 --> 03:09:17,140
It's cause like I feel...

3591
03:09:17,140 --> 03:09:20,900
I keep thinking it's like the instant hit, but not the delay hit.

3592
03:09:21,180 --> 03:09:23,420
And then I start panic rolling because of it.

3593
03:09:24,940 --> 03:09:25,960
Don't worry, guys.

3594
03:09:26,080 --> 03:09:26,940
I will refill it.

3595
03:09:28,500 --> 03:09:30,340
No turn your shithead.

3596
03:09:31,120 --> 03:09:33,280
I'm refilling the messages, guys.

3597
03:09:33,460 --> 03:09:33,880
Don't worry.

3598
03:09:34,580 --> 03:09:35,100
Reload.

3599
03:09:39,060 --> 03:09:39,900
Reload.

3600
03:09:45,240 --> 03:09:45,660
Alright.

3601
03:09:48,520 --> 03:09:49,140
Oh.

3602
03:09:53,320 --> 03:09:53,940
Pilargus.

3603
03:09:53,940 --> 03:09:55,720
Thank you for the super chat.

3604
03:09:56,100 --> 03:09:56,260
Thank you.

3605
03:09:56,440 --> 03:09:57,560
Please, I swear.

3606
03:09:57,900 --> 03:09:59,040
I'll get better.

3607
03:09:59,420 --> 03:10:02,820
I know it's been a while since we beat phase one.

3608
03:10:03,020 --> 03:10:04,860
But I swear to God, I'll get better.

3609
03:10:16,840 --> 03:10:17,460
Okay.

3610
03:10:19,690 --> 03:10:21,110
I'm just gonna use my...

3611
03:10:27,270 --> 03:10:27,750
Okay.

3612
03:10:28,770 --> 03:10:29,530
Oh, Sarah.

3613
03:10:29,690 --> 03:10:30,390
Thank you for the rain.

3614
03:10:30,550 --> 03:10:30,830
Thank you.

3615
03:10:30,930 --> 03:10:31,550
Thank you.

3616
03:10:31,750 --> 03:10:32,190
Come on.

3617
03:10:33,030 --> 03:10:33,410
No!

3618
03:10:35,430 --> 03:10:35,910
Okay.

3619
03:10:36,390 --> 03:10:37,110
I got that rolling.

3620
03:10:37,490 --> 03:10:38,330
Oh, my God.

3621
03:10:38,330 --> 03:10:39,110
I didn't get that though.

3622
03:10:41,150 --> 03:10:41,810
It's okay.

3623
03:10:42,350 --> 03:10:43,310
My child.

3624
03:10:43,930 --> 03:10:44,610
Oh, my God.

3625
03:10:44,850 --> 03:10:45,790
My child.

3626
03:10:45,970 --> 03:10:47,830
You sacrificed yourself for me.

3627
03:10:48,910 --> 03:10:51,710
I swear to God, you won't die in vain.

3628
03:10:53,170 --> 03:10:53,650
Nevermind.

3629
03:10:57,130 --> 03:10:57,830
Oh.

3630
03:10:57,850 --> 03:10:58,030
Oh.

3631
03:11:06,210 --> 03:11:06,970
Okay.

3632
03:11:07,690 --> 03:11:09,410
We might have died in vain.

3633
03:11:10,030 --> 03:11:10,250
Oh.

3634
03:11:11,010 --> 03:11:11,810
We might...

3635
03:11:11,810 --> 03:11:14,390
We might have disappointed my child.

3636
03:11:14,690 --> 03:11:15,710
But it's okay.

3637
03:11:16,530 --> 03:11:17,330
It's okay.

3638
03:11:21,150 --> 03:11:21,910
Alright.

3639
03:11:22,290 --> 03:11:23,450
This time, we'll lock in.

3640
03:11:26,030 --> 03:11:28,470
This time we lock in, for real.

3641
03:11:28,650 --> 03:11:31,750
Look at all these blood splatters, they're 90% me.

3642
03:11:34,290 --> 03:11:36,930
Guys, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

3643
03:11:41,700 --> 03:11:45,080
Well, we're sort of, like, degrading the longer we go.

3644
03:11:45,460 --> 03:11:48,340
We haven't seen the other guy in a long time.

3645
03:11:48,760 --> 03:11:51,360
I don't know, I feel like that's bad.

3646
03:11:52,600 --> 03:11:58,140
Guys, remember when we would, like, first try, like, I don't know what happened, guys.

3647
03:12:00,440 --> 03:12:00,960
I

3648
03:12:04,060 --> 03:12:04,520
remember.

3649
03:12:12,190 --> 03:12:13,470
No, no, no, no, no, no!

3650
03:12:13,470 --> 03:12:13,810
Pounding game!

3651
03:12:13,970 --> 03:12:14,230
Pounding game!

3652
03:12:14,730 --> 03:12:20,630
Every time, my head just, my head can't comprehend.

3653
03:12:22,590 --> 03:12:28,870
Every time, my head just sees he holds it for, like, four seconds longer.

3654
03:12:28,870 --> 03:12:35,570
And then my... my brain short-circuits... I short-circuit there.

3655
03:12:35,910 --> 03:12:37,270
No, no, we can do it.

3656
03:12:37,450 --> 03:12:40,690
I believe... we can do it.

3657
03:12:45,550 --> 03:12:46,850
No, no.

3658
03:12:47,290 --> 03:12:47,430
Alright.

3659
03:12:47,890 --> 03:12:49,570
Mama raised no quitter.

3660
03:12:55,120 --> 03:12:55,480
No.

3661
03:12:56,980 --> 03:12:58,380
This is fine.

3662
03:12:59,360 --> 03:13:01,100
We ain't no quitter.

3663
03:13:05,200 --> 03:13:08,420
My brain cell didn't die in vain.

3664
03:13:21,410 --> 03:13:22,210
Okay.

3665
03:13:32,740 --> 03:13:33,140
Alright.

3666
03:13:35,660 --> 03:13:36,920
Oh my god.

3667
03:13:37,380 --> 03:13:39,580
Guys, I miss when everybody would appraise me.

3668
03:13:42,800 --> 03:13:45,860
We definitely ran out of appraisals, guys.

3669
03:13:49,500 --> 03:13:52,720
Oh my god, you turned around?!

3670
03:13:54,800 --> 03:13:55,820
That's fucked up.

3671
03:13:56,520 --> 03:13:57,700
You turned around.

3672
03:14:14,980 --> 03:14:15,460
Okay.

3673
03:14:17,740 --> 03:14:19,100
No, I wanted to TP!

3674
03:14:21,060 --> 03:14:22,320
Alright, we back up here.

3675
03:14:22,840 --> 03:14:26,720
And then we back up there, and then we keep backing up because he's like a little scary.

3676
03:14:26,720 --> 03:14:28,880
And then he misses.

3677
03:14:29,080 --> 03:14:29,540
That's fine.

3678
03:14:32,520 --> 03:14:33,000
Okay.

3679
03:14:34,520 --> 03:14:35,640
Are you serious?

3680
03:14:36,120 --> 03:14:37,220
That's fucked up.

3681
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:39,500
Okay.

3682
03:14:41,160 --> 03:14:43,220
Oh my god.

3683
03:14:44,020 --> 03:14:45,360
Oh my god.

3684
03:14:45,840 --> 03:14:46,160
No!

3685
03:14:46,540 --> 03:14:46,820
No!

3686
03:14:51,030 --> 03:14:53,010
That's not fair!

3687
03:14:53,920 --> 03:14:55,990
That's not fair!

3688
03:14:56,810 --> 03:14:58,010
He...

3689
03:14:58,010 --> 03:15:00,610
My jellyfish fucking...

3690
03:15:00,800 --> 03:15:02,270
Oh my god.

3691
03:15:02,730 --> 03:15:04,310
My jellyfish...

3692
03:15:04,310 --> 03:15:06,550
Broke the stance.

3693
03:15:06,950 --> 03:15:10,780
I can't believe my jellyfish got the fucking stagger.

3694
03:15:11,330 --> 03:15:17,290
Oh my god.

3695
03:15:18,310 --> 03:15:30,290
Oh my god.

3696
03:15:31,130 --> 03:15:35,210
I guess I'll boot up the game on my second PC.

3697
03:15:37,390 --> 03:15:39,650
We'll get there eventually.

3698
03:15:43,590 --> 03:15:44,570
That's sad.

3699
03:15:44,850 --> 03:15:47,910
The jellyfish is the main character now.

3700
03:15:50,610 --> 03:15:51,490
Oh my god.

3701
03:15:51,570 --> 03:15:51,590
Oh my god.

3702
03:15:51,630 --> 03:15:52,490
That's not what I want to do.

3703
03:15:55,860 --> 03:15:58,440
I might buy like a wireless controller.

3704
03:15:58,920 --> 03:16:00,360
Because I'm...

3705
03:16:00,360 --> 03:16:01,880
Oh my god.

3706
03:16:01,880 --> 03:16:02,980
I'm not feeling it.

3707
03:16:04,320 --> 03:16:05,540
The future fucking...

3708
03:16:06,180 --> 03:16:08,280
The wire is pissing me off.

3709
03:16:16,330 --> 03:16:16,930
Oh my god.

3710
03:16:24,020 --> 03:16:24,620
I...

3711
03:16:24,620 --> 03:16:25,340
I'm so sad.

3712
03:16:25,700 --> 03:16:26,920
I'm so sad.

3713
03:16:27,120 --> 03:16:27,980
I'm so sad.

3714
03:16:28,520 --> 03:16:29,060
I'm so sad.

3715
03:16:30,760 --> 03:16:32,780
I didn't anticipate...

3716
03:16:33,380 --> 03:16:34,360
Oh my god.

3717
03:16:40,750 --> 03:16:41,350
Okay.

3718
03:16:44,920 --> 03:16:45,520
What?

3719
03:16:45,800 --> 03:16:47,340
How do you get out of that?

3720
03:16:50,640 --> 03:16:51,860
Oh my god.

3721
03:16:51,860 --> 03:16:52,800
He actually comboed me.

3722
03:16:52,980 --> 03:16:53,800
No, no, no, no, no.

3723
03:16:53,860 --> 03:16:54,180
Not again.

3724
03:16:54,580 --> 03:16:55,200
Oh, thank god.

3725
03:16:55,360 --> 03:16:55,480
Okay.

3726
03:17:12,010 --> 03:17:12,870
Oh, I jump.

3727
03:17:13,110 --> 03:17:13,270
Okay.

3728
03:17:13,690 --> 03:17:14,110
Now I know.

3729
03:17:19,940 --> 03:17:20,640
Now I know.

3730
03:17:20,740 --> 03:17:21,400
I just gotta jump.

3731
03:17:26,240 --> 03:17:26,640
Jesus.

3732
03:17:29,720 --> 03:17:30,120
Okay.

3733
03:17:32,980 --> 03:17:36,360
Me and my child were on a little road trip.

3734
03:17:40,100 --> 03:17:42,040
Honestly, worst road trip of my life.

3735
03:17:45,220 --> 03:17:46,740
I feel like he's just...

3736
03:17:46,740 --> 03:17:47,620
He's getting better.

3737
03:17:47,900 --> 03:17:48,640
And I'm like...

3738
03:17:48,640 --> 03:17:50,060
I've peaked in high school.

3739
03:17:54,680 --> 03:17:55,800
He's actually...

3740
03:17:55,800 --> 03:17:56,700
He's learning.

3741
03:17:56,960 --> 03:17:58,660
I'm helping this AI learn.

3742
03:17:59,720 --> 03:18:00,000
I...

3743
03:18:08,040 --> 03:18:09,340
Oh my god.

3744
03:18:09,500 --> 03:18:10,520
He turns around.

3745
03:18:10,680 --> 03:18:11,620
Because of course he does.

3746
03:18:14,480 --> 03:18:15,380
Don't worry.

3747
03:18:15,680 --> 03:18:15,960
Don't worry, child.

3748
03:18:16,340 --> 03:18:18,080
Your death won't be in vain.

3749
03:18:18,080 --> 03:18:20,140
I swear to god for real this time.

3750
03:18:24,220 --> 03:18:25,060
Oh my god.

3751
03:18:25,620 --> 03:18:26,520
Oh my god.

3752
03:18:26,640 --> 03:18:27,080
There we go.

3753
03:18:27,080 --> 03:18:27,100
There we go.

3754
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:31,720
I'm feeding the AI right now.

3755
03:18:36,350 --> 03:18:37,010
Alright.

3756
03:18:39,810 --> 03:18:42,340
I don't know if we're gonna win this, but like...

3757
03:18:44,400 --> 03:18:45,140
Tape is everything.

3758
03:18:45,140 --> 03:18:47,160
Why can't we be friends.

3759
03:18:47,700 --> 03:18:49,560
Why can't we be friends?

3760
03:18:50,060 --> 03:18:52,180
He can do that?!

3761
03:18:52,940 --> 03:18:53,660
What?!

3762
03:18:53,660 --> 03:18:54,380
I'm...

3763
03:18:54,380 --> 03:18:55,120
I'm...

3764
03:18:55,120 --> 03:18:56,680
What's going...

3765
03:18:56,680 --> 03:18:57,300
Guys, guys.

3766
03:18:57,460 --> 03:18:57,900
Appraise me.

3767
03:18:58,020 --> 03:18:59,120
Please, please!

3768
03:18:59,340 --> 03:19:00,420
We can't appraise this!

3769
03:19:00,420 --> 03:19:03,500
We can live through all of this!

3770
03:19:04,340 --> 03:19:06,360
What did he do?!

3771
03:19:06,360 --> 03:19:11,760
I swear I've never seen that move before.

3772
03:19:15,990 --> 03:19:19,130
Oh, what the fuck happened there?

3773
03:19:20,290 --> 03:19:21,810
Holy shit.

3774
03:19:23,550 --> 03:19:26,630
It was a power appraisal as we lived.

3775
03:19:26,650 --> 03:19:27,610
I don't know how.

3776
03:19:29,250 --> 03:19:31,130
Oh my god.

3777
03:19:31,130 --> 03:19:33,530
We definitely didn't deserve to.

3778
03:19:47,740 --> 03:19:48,400
Okay.

3779
03:19:51,620 --> 03:19:52,980
It's a rare move.

3780
03:19:53,200 --> 03:19:53,700
That's cool.

3781
03:19:57,080 --> 03:20:02,120
Because of course... Because of course he'll use the rare move on me.

3782
03:20:20,010 --> 03:20:21,350
Oh my god.

3783
03:20:21,630 --> 03:20:22,970
Every time I get closer.

3784
03:20:26,230 --> 03:20:27,170
What is that?

3785
03:20:27,430 --> 03:20:27,530
Oh!

3786
03:20:27,950 --> 03:20:29,230
I guess there I go.

3787
03:20:30,750 --> 03:20:31,250
Okay.

3788
03:20:31,390 --> 03:20:33,250
I don't know how to do this jump thing.

3789
03:20:34,710 --> 03:20:35,230
Like...

3790
03:20:36,850 --> 03:20:38,490
Guys, did I do it?

3791
03:20:39,690 --> 03:20:41,830
Guys, do you think I did it?

3792
03:20:42,310 --> 03:20:44,510
Do you think I did something?

3793
03:20:46,610 --> 03:20:48,910
Oh my... I'm not okay.

3794
03:20:53,770 --> 03:20:54,450
I don't know how to do it.

3795
03:20:54,450 --> 03:20:54,770
Jump, girl.

3796
03:20:55,110 --> 03:20:55,350
Jump.

3797
03:20:59,330 --> 03:21:00,930
No, I have Torrin.

3798
03:21:01,170 --> 03:21:05,070
But like... I... I don't know how to efficiently use him.

3799
03:21:05,230 --> 03:21:06,050
That's the issue.

3800
03:21:07,410 --> 03:21:09,930
Every time I use Torrin, I fuck up.

3801
03:21:11,070 --> 03:21:13,190
So at that point, I've given up.

3802
03:21:25,430 --> 03:21:26,850
No, I deserve that.

3803
03:21:30,680 --> 03:21:31,300
No.

3804
03:21:32,900 --> 03:21:33,500
Okay.

3805
03:21:38,880 --> 03:21:39,500
Okay.

3806
03:21:41,060 --> 03:21:42,380
Oh my god!

3807
03:21:42,600 --> 03:21:43,340
Alright, that's fine.

3808
03:21:50,560 --> 03:21:52,560
Maybe I don't deserve Torrin.

3809
03:21:52,660 --> 03:21:53,100
You're right.

3810
03:21:53,440 --> 03:21:55,100
I don't deserve my horse.

3811
03:21:55,260 --> 03:21:56,080
Okay, let's try this.

3812
03:21:56,920 --> 03:21:57,480
Okay.

3813
03:21:58,300 --> 03:21:59,660
Maybe we can do it.

3814
03:22:01,160 --> 03:22:02,040
I believe.

3815
03:22:02,240 --> 03:22:03,880
How do I get off my horse efficiently, guys?

3816
03:22:09,940 --> 03:22:11,340
It's not like that.

3817
03:22:15,160 --> 03:22:17,020
Barely not like that, guys.

3818
03:22:28,570 --> 03:22:29,670
Oh my god.

3819
03:22:29,850 --> 03:22:31,810
What is going on?!

3820
03:22:34,250 --> 03:22:35,610
Just like that.

3821
03:22:48,460 --> 03:22:49,080
Okay.

3822
03:22:57,470 --> 03:22:58,530
What's going on?

3823
03:22:58,990 --> 03:23:00,530
I don't know what this is.

3824
03:23:01,530 --> 03:23:01,730
Oh.

3825
03:23:02,390 --> 03:23:02,590
Oh.

3826
03:23:03,230 --> 03:23:03,370
Oh.

3827
03:23:03,530 --> 03:23:03,650
Oh.

3828
03:23:03,650 --> 03:23:04,110
Guys, guys.

3829
03:23:07,270 --> 03:23:08,430
What's going on?

3830
03:23:09,110 --> 03:23:10,320
What's going on?!

3831
03:23:17,870 --> 03:23:20,350
What the fuck is going on?!

3832
03:23:21,630 --> 03:23:22,830
I'm at the end!

3833
03:23:23,110 --> 03:23:23,550
I'm at the end!

3834
03:23:23,550 --> 03:23:24,850
He took me to the end!

3835
03:23:25,050 --> 03:23:26,350
How is that possible?!

3836
03:23:45,100 --> 03:23:47,360
I don't know what's going on.

3837
03:23:47,560 --> 03:23:50,860
I don't know half the moves he's using.

3838
03:23:57,060 --> 03:24:00,060
I feel like it's not good that he took me so far out here.

3839
03:24:01,120 --> 03:24:02,460
Guys, I don't think I can...

3840
03:24:02,460 --> 03:24:04,240
I don't know if I can do this one.

3841
03:24:04,240 --> 03:24:04,260
I don't know if I can do this one.

3842
03:24:09,590 --> 03:24:10,190
Right.

3843
03:24:12,350 --> 03:24:12,950
Oh!

3844
03:24:13,550 --> 03:24:15,470
I was going to say, I did it!

3845
03:24:16,410 --> 03:24:17,990
Guys, I didn't do it.

3846
03:24:18,090 --> 03:24:19,870
I didn't do it!

3847
03:24:21,690 --> 03:24:24,050
I was going to be like, guys, I did it!

3848
03:24:24,770 --> 03:24:26,230
Guys, I didn't do it.

3849
03:24:27,670 --> 03:24:29,070
I was so hopeful.

3850
03:24:34,010 --> 03:24:37,490
What the fuck happened to me?!

3851
03:24:38,290 --> 03:24:39,910
Oh my god!

3852
03:24:49,370 --> 03:24:49,930
Okay.

3853
03:24:50,910 --> 03:24:52,270
I'll get here eventually, guys.

3854
03:24:57,010 --> 03:24:58,270
Oh my god, I made it.

3855
03:25:00,630 --> 03:25:01,930
I made it!

3856
03:25:08,570 --> 03:25:10,250
Oh no, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!

3857
03:25:10,430 --> 03:25:10,970
Please!

3858
03:25:15,070 --> 03:25:15,630
Okay.

3859
03:25:19,610 --> 03:25:20,710
Oh god, that was scary.

3860
03:25:22,970 --> 03:25:23,950
Guys, I made it.

3861
03:25:23,950 --> 03:25:25,110
Never mind.

3862
03:25:26,150 --> 03:25:27,830
I guess I'll never make it.

3863
03:25:28,230 --> 03:25:28,770
I can't!

3864
03:25:48,160 --> 03:25:48,640
Okay.

3865
03:25:49,220 --> 03:25:51,200
I'll get there eventually, sir.

3866
03:25:51,680 --> 03:25:52,960
Please, just wait up.

3867
03:25:58,180 --> 03:25:59,540
Can you wait for me, please?

3868
03:26:00,460 --> 03:26:00,800
Oh!

3869
03:26:01,840 --> 03:26:03,060
Not like that, though.

3870
03:26:03,760 --> 03:26:04,940
Please, not like that.

3871
03:26:06,300 --> 03:26:07,560
Oh no, I'm fucking dead.

3872
03:26:07,640 --> 03:26:08,000
I'm dead.

3873
03:26:08,140 --> 03:26:08,460
I'm dead.

3874
03:26:08,620 --> 03:26:09,000
I'm dead.

3875
03:26:10,820 --> 03:26:11,980
Last upgrade.

3876
03:26:12,420 --> 03:26:12,720
Last upgrade.

3877
03:26:12,720 --> 03:26:13,080
Last, last heal.

3878
03:26:19,010 --> 03:26:20,490
Oh my god!

3879
03:26:20,770 --> 03:26:22,270
I don't know how to dodge that!

3880
03:26:23,390 --> 03:26:25,630
I never got that far!

3881
03:26:31,110 --> 03:26:31,830
Oh!

3882
03:26:32,170 --> 03:26:39,950
Oh my god, please.

3883
03:26:43,730 --> 03:26:44,450
No!

3884
03:26:44,890 --> 03:26:45,610
Guys!

3885
03:26:58,170 --> 03:27:00,730
We did it!

3886
03:27:01,090 --> 03:27:01,670
We did it!

3887
03:27:03,020 --> 03:27:04,790
Oh, save me!

3888
03:27:05,430 --> 03:27:05,710
Save!

3889
03:27:06,870 --> 03:27:11,050
Oh, the power of the streamer build!

3890
03:27:11,850 --> 03:27:12,750
Oh my god!

3891
03:27:14,790 --> 03:27:16,570
We fucking did it!

3892
03:27:17,190 --> 03:27:18,510
Oh my god!

3893
03:27:20,070 --> 03:27:24,170
With the power of the streamer build!

3894
03:27:24,170 --> 03:27:27,050
Oh my god!

3895
03:27:27,250 --> 03:27:30,050
Oh my god!

3896
03:27:31,330 --> 03:27:32,430
Oh my god!

3897
03:27:33,310 --> 03:27:33,390
Okay.

3898
03:27:33,930 --> 03:27:36,130
Oh my god!

3899
03:27:36,570 --> 03:27:38,110
Time for it!

3900
03:27:39,570 --> 03:27:41,430
We did it!

3901
03:27:42,790 --> 03:27:43,790
We did it!

3902
03:27:43,790 --> 03:27:44,210
We finally...

3903
03:27:44,210 --> 03:27:45,170
Oh my god!

3904
03:27:45,490 --> 03:27:47,730
We became John Elden Ring!

3905
03:27:48,850 --> 03:27:49,390
Touch...

3906
03:27:49,870 --> 03:27:51,330
Mend the Elden Ring!

3907
03:27:52,390 --> 03:27:53,770
Oh my god!

3908
03:27:53,770 --> 03:27:55,510
Now that these bursts...

3909
03:27:56,270 --> 03:27:57,730
100Message of phrases!

3910
03:27:58,970 --> 03:27:59,610
The newrd message of phrases!

3911
03:27:59,610 --> 03:28:00,670
Do you think I did it?

3912
03:28:05,690 --> 03:28:07,070
Oh my god!

3913
03:28:07,390 --> 03:28:09,170
It's time to get that head, guys!

3914
03:28:10,050 --> 03:28:12,050
We've been trying for so long!

3915
03:28:12,850 --> 03:28:13,010
No!

3916
03:28:16,810 --> 03:28:17,630
Linden Ring!

3917
03:28:17,830 --> 03:28:19,230
Thank you, this super chat banana!

3918
03:28:19,550 --> 03:28:19,850
Thank you!

3919
03:28:19,990 --> 03:28:20,590
Thank you!

3920
03:28:24,390 --> 03:28:25,470
We did it.

3921
03:28:25,710 --> 03:28:27,910
The strongest build in the Elden Ring.

3922
03:28:29,470 --> 03:28:29,970
Recyclement.

3923
03:28:30,130 --> 03:28:31,550
Thank you for the Akka Supa.

3924
03:28:31,650 --> 03:28:31,950
Thank you.

3925
03:28:32,110 --> 03:28:32,670
Thank you.

3926
03:28:36,910 --> 03:28:38,610
The strongest build.

3927
03:28:54,280 --> 03:28:55,140
Mind size.

3928
03:28:55,300 --> 03:28:56,080
Thank you to the Super Chat.

3929
03:28:56,260 --> 03:28:56,500
Thank you.

3930
03:28:56,620 --> 03:28:56,980
Thank you.

3931
03:28:57,060 --> 03:28:59,800
Congrats on beating the game Tokyo Capital.

3932
03:28:59,800 --> 03:29:00,720
We did it.

3933
03:29:00,720 --> 03:29:03,100
We actually beat the game.

3934
03:29:04,520 --> 03:29:07,200
I didn't think I was this close to the ending.

3935
03:29:16,320 --> 03:29:19,460
Me and my 4000 dragoons.

3936
03:29:21,470 --> 03:29:22,880
I have an army.

3937
03:29:35,830 --> 03:29:36,330
On us.

3938
03:29:36,810 --> 03:29:37,530
And recall.

3939
03:29:40,490 --> 03:29:41,310
That's me.

3940
03:29:41,730 --> 03:29:42,230
An age.

3941
03:29:42,810 --> 03:29:44,010
Of fracture.

3942
03:29:44,370 --> 03:29:45,430
And have no maidens.

3943
03:29:45,630 --> 03:29:47,870
So my armor is my maiden now.

3944
03:29:48,170 --> 03:29:49,450
I don't need no maidens.

3945
03:29:50,750 --> 03:29:52,730
I can touch myself.

3946
03:29:58,070 --> 03:29:59,470
That's me.

3947
03:30:00,150 --> 03:30:02,210
I'm the Elden Lord.

3948
03:30:03,170 --> 03:30:03,590
Yay!

3949
03:30:08,070 --> 03:30:10,590
My armor can touch me.

3950
03:30:14,150 --> 03:30:14,830
Oh.

3951
03:30:16,330 --> 03:30:17,050
Thank God.

3952
03:30:17,670 --> 03:30:18,690
We did it.

3953
03:30:19,150 --> 03:30:20,090
What a ride.

3954
03:30:20,550 --> 03:30:22,990
I did not think we were going to beat Elden Ring today.

3955
03:30:22,990 --> 03:30:23,650
But we did.

3956
03:30:23,990 --> 03:30:24,930
I'm so tired.

3957
03:30:24,930 --> 03:30:30,390
I'm going to treat myself with some good ass mac and cheese.

3958
03:30:34,130 --> 03:30:35,030
Yippee.

3959
03:30:36,830 --> 03:30:37,550
We...

3960
03:30:37,550 --> 03:30:38,210
Oh.

3961
03:30:38,590 --> 03:30:39,710
That was fun.

3962
03:30:39,970 --> 03:30:41,130
What a wild ride.

3963
03:30:41,590 --> 03:30:41,730
Chat.

3964
03:30:42,110 --> 03:30:43,350
What a fucking rile...

3965
03:30:43,990 --> 03:30:44,710
Blah.

3966
03:30:44,790 --> 03:30:45,690
Can't even English.

3967
03:30:46,030 --> 03:30:47,510
What a wild journey.

3968
03:30:48,030 --> 03:30:48,550
To the end.

3969
03:30:48,550 --> 03:30:49,910
The thing is.

3970
03:30:50,050 --> 03:30:50,230
I...

3971
03:30:50,230 --> 03:30:51,150
I didn't know.

3972
03:30:51,950 --> 03:30:52,510
How...

3973
03:30:52,510 --> 03:30:53,350
Close we were.

3974
03:30:53,490 --> 03:30:54,710
To beating Elden Ring.

3975
03:30:54,890 --> 03:30:56,470
I had two more thumbnails made.

3976
03:30:56,610 --> 03:30:57,150
In advance.

3977
03:30:58,370 --> 03:30:58,930
I...

3978
03:30:59,550 --> 03:31:01,110
I had two more thumbnails.

3979
03:31:01,470 --> 03:31:02,390
Made in advance.

3980
03:31:02,730 --> 03:31:05,410
Because I thought we had so much more Elden Ring left.

3981
03:31:05,930 --> 03:31:06,670
So like...

3982
03:31:06,670 --> 03:31:06,930
Whoops.

3983
03:31:12,310 --> 03:31:12,830
Tell us.

3984
03:31:12,950 --> 03:31:14,190
Welcome to Tomato Farm.

3985
03:31:14,570 --> 03:31:15,130
Welcome...

3986
03:31:15,130 --> 03:31:16,890
That's for the DLC.

3987
03:31:16,890 --> 03:31:17,470
Let's see.

3988
03:31:17,870 --> 03:31:18,230
Oh.

3989
03:31:18,390 --> 03:31:19,670
That's another charity.

3990
03:31:20,090 --> 03:31:20,230
Cool.

3991
03:31:21,970 --> 03:31:22,490
Um...

3992
03:31:22,490 --> 03:31:23,010
But yeah.

3993
03:31:23,310 --> 03:31:23,870
Thank you guys.

3994
03:31:24,150 --> 03:31:25,990
My brain is so tired now.

3995
03:31:26,730 --> 03:31:28,750
I didn't think I'd be...

3996
03:31:28,750 --> 03:31:29,610
I mean...

3997
03:31:29,610 --> 03:31:30,610
I was gonna stream.

3998
03:31:30,970 --> 03:31:31,170
Wait.

3999
03:31:31,190 --> 03:31:32,330
How long was I streaming for?

4000
03:31:32,950 --> 03:31:33,930
Oh my gosh.

4001
03:31:34,350 --> 03:31:36,390
I didn't think I'd do a 3 hour stream today.

4002
03:31:36,530 --> 03:31:37,850
Because I did another 2 hour already.

4003
03:31:38,030 --> 03:31:38,630
This morning.

4004
03:31:39,310 --> 03:31:39,830
Um...

4005
03:31:39,830 --> 03:31:40,590
But thank you guys.

4006
03:31:40,730 --> 03:31:40,910
Look.

4007
03:31:41,130 --> 03:31:41,310
Guys.

4008
03:31:41,570 --> 03:31:43,890
Under 200 deaths with me.

4009
03:31:45,890 --> 03:31:46,870
I'm so tired.

4010
03:31:46,870 --> 03:31:47,370
I'm so tired.

4011
03:31:50,390 --> 03:31:51,110
But...

4012
03:31:51,110 --> 03:31:51,990
It was a...

4013
03:31:51,990 --> 03:31:52,930
Wild ride.

4014
03:31:53,210 --> 03:31:55,370
It was a great journey with all my dragoons.

4015
03:31:55,870 --> 03:31:57,130
Thank you everybody for...

4016
03:31:57,550 --> 03:31:58,130
The Akasufas.

4017
03:31:58,930 --> 03:32:00,210
I really, really do...

4018
03:32:00,750 --> 03:32:02,210
Appreciate it guys.

4019
03:32:02,490 --> 03:32:04,530
Thank you everyone for the support and everything.

4020
03:32:04,850 --> 03:32:05,390
And for...

4021
03:32:05,390 --> 03:32:06,750
Helping me...

4022
03:32:06,750 --> 03:32:07,230
Uh...

4023
03:32:07,230 --> 03:32:08,110
Fundraise for...

4024
03:32:08,110 --> 03:32:08,950
My...

4025
03:32:08,950 --> 03:32:09,390
Um...

4026
03:32:09,390 --> 03:32:10,470
3D...

4027
03:32:10,470 --> 03:32:10,730
Debut.

4028
03:32:11,050 --> 03:32:12,670
I really appreciate it guys.

4029
03:32:14,070 --> 03:32:14,710
Um...

4030
03:32:14,710 --> 03:32:15,430
Solid Snake.

4031
03:32:15,530 --> 03:32:17,030
Thank you for the Akasufa.

4032
03:32:17,150 --> 03:32:17,370
Thank you.

4033
03:32:17,510 --> 03:32:18,050
Thank you.

4034
03:32:18,390 --> 03:32:20,430
Here's my very first ever Akka.

4035
03:32:20,770 --> 03:32:22,490
Congrats on becoming the...

4036
03:32:22,490 --> 03:32:23,910
Praise Elden Braid.

4037
03:32:23,910 --> 03:32:26,250
This is not only because you beat the game.

4038
03:32:26,350 --> 03:32:29,210
But also because I know you will make an amazing event with this.

4039
03:32:29,350 --> 03:32:29,810
Like always.

4040
03:32:30,090 --> 03:32:31,230
Amazing job Doki.

4041
03:32:31,430 --> 03:32:31,930
Rest well.

4042
03:32:32,150 --> 03:32:32,770
Thank you.

4043
03:32:33,090 --> 03:32:35,190
Thank you for the Akasufa.

4044
03:32:35,430 --> 03:32:35,890
Thank you.

4045
03:32:36,050 --> 03:32:36,790
Thank you.

4046
03:32:37,790 --> 03:32:38,270
Um...

4047
03:32:38,270 --> 03:32:38,690
But yes.

4048
03:32:38,690 --> 03:32:40,690
I don't wanna like hype it up too much.

4049
03:32:40,810 --> 03:32:41,390
But I'm trying...

4050
03:32:41,390 --> 03:32:43,790
I wanna make a really good stream for you guys.

4051
03:32:43,870 --> 03:32:45,230
Cause you've been waiting for so long.

4052
03:32:45,230 --> 03:32:46,330
For the 3D debut.

4053
03:32:46,910 --> 03:32:47,350
So...

4054
03:32:47,350 --> 03:32:47,890
Um...

4055
03:32:47,890 --> 03:32:49,510
Thank you guys so much for...

4056
03:32:49,510 --> 03:32:49,830
Uh...

4057
03:32:49,830 --> 03:32:50,690
Supporting me.

4058
03:32:50,970 --> 03:32:51,350
Um...

4059
03:32:51,350 --> 03:32:52,030
But this will be my...

4060
03:32:52,030 --> 03:32:52,630
I swear to god.

4061
03:32:52,730 --> 03:32:54,250
That will be my last big investment.

4062
03:32:54,510 --> 03:32:55,470
That will be the last one.

4063
03:32:55,630 --> 03:32:56,610
And then after that...

4064
03:32:56,610 --> 03:32:57,370
There will be...

4065
03:32:57,370 --> 03:32:58,670
There will be smaller things.

4066
03:32:58,790 --> 03:32:59,330
I swear.

4067
03:32:59,530 --> 03:33:00,610
This is the last one.

4068
03:33:02,170 --> 03:33:03,250
This will be like...

4069
03:33:03,250 --> 03:33:04,250
My last...

4070
03:33:04,250 --> 03:33:04,550
Big...

4071
03:33:04,550 --> 03:33:06,450
My biggest project...

4072
03:33:06,450 --> 03:33:06,850
Ever.

4073
03:33:06,850 --> 03:33:08,390
And then like...

4074
03:33:08,390 --> 03:33:09,190
And then we'll...

4075
03:33:09,190 --> 03:33:10,810
And then we'll...

4076
03:33:10,810 --> 03:33:11,350
We'll...

4077
03:33:11,350 --> 03:33:11,610
We'll...

4078
03:33:20,890 --> 03:33:22,430
We'll save for...

4079
03:33:22,430 --> 03:33:23,350
An apartment.

4080
03:33:24,490 --> 03:33:25,210
Um...

4081
03:33:25,210 --> 03:33:25,630
Courteous!

4082
03:33:25,750 --> 03:33:27,190
Thank you for our Magenta Soupa!

4083
03:33:27,190 --> 03:33:27,830
Thank you!

4084
03:33:28,030 --> 03:33:29,710
I love good streams.

4085
03:33:29,870 --> 03:33:30,690
Thank you guys.

4086
03:33:31,050 --> 03:33:33,430
Thank you." I really appreciate it.

4087
03:33:33,570 --> 03:33:34,350
Thank you everybody.

4088
03:33:35,130 --> 03:33:35,850
Um...

4089
03:33:35,850 --> 03:33:48,470
Technically, I can... I can afford it, like the 3D, but I just want to make sure that, you know, just to be safety, you know, just to safety after I spent that money.

4090
03:33:51,730 --> 03:33:52,570
Thank you.

4091
03:33:52,670 --> 03:33:57,330
What a long, long journey, guys.

4092
03:33:57,610 --> 03:34:00,010
We had a long journey today.

4093
03:34:00,010 --> 03:34:04,910
Um, I am, I am like, uh, yeah.

4094
03:34:05,270 --> 03:34:06,330
Like, it's that cushion.

4095
03:34:06,550 --> 03:34:06,970
Yeah, yeah.

4096
03:34:07,150 --> 03:34:08,250
It's the cushion for me.

4097
03:34:08,470 --> 03:34:08,850
Yeah.

4098
03:34:09,150 --> 03:34:10,030
But thank you, guys.

4099
03:34:10,230 --> 03:34:12,070
We, we yelled at each other.

4100
03:34:12,370 --> 03:34:13,730
We made up.

4101
03:34:14,170 --> 03:34:16,290
And then we yelled at each other again.

4102
03:34:16,690 --> 03:34:17,710
There were threats.

4103
03:34:17,950 --> 03:34:19,130
There were negotiations.

4104
03:34:19,650 --> 03:34:20,710
There were bribes.

4105
03:34:21,130 --> 03:34:23,010
Um, there was executions.

4106
03:34:23,010 --> 03:34:28,750
But in the end, the streamer build reigned supreme, guys.

4107
03:34:29,690 --> 03:34:35,390
In the end, the streamer build succeeded yet again.

4108
03:34:39,370 --> 03:34:42,290
There was hostage situation.

4109
03:34:42,290 --> 03:34:44,030
There was extortion.

4110
03:34:44,530 --> 03:34:45,370
There was everything.

4111
03:34:45,370 --> 03:34:48,590
This Elden Ring playthrough had everything, guys.

4112
03:34:49,150 --> 03:34:50,270
Uh, ha ha ha.

4113
03:34:50,770 --> 03:34:54,670
There was even a rebellion that I managed to squash.

4114
03:34:54,990 --> 03:34:55,710
So, yay.

4115
03:34:56,390 --> 03:34:57,310
Ha ha ha.

4116
03:34:57,570 --> 03:34:58,090
Ha ha ha.

4117
03:34:58,710 --> 03:35:13,070
And in the end, we proved to everybody that when we all work together, when we all work together, we can triumph and take on the world.

4118
03:35:14,030 --> 03:35:15,730
when we stop arguing.

4119
03:35:16,190 --> 03:35:17,270
When we...

4120
03:35:17,270 --> 03:35:17,390
When we...

4121
03:35:17,390 --> 03:35:17,810
Ha ha ha.

4122
03:35:19,330 --> 03:35:19,410
Ha ha ha.

4123
03:35:19,570 --> 03:35:19,890
Ha ha ha.

4124
03:35:20,510 --> 03:35:21,630
But thank you, everybody.

4125
03:35:21,950 --> 03:35:22,510
I am...

4126
03:35:22,510 --> 03:35:23,910
I am EP now.

4127
03:35:24,570 --> 03:35:27,430
Um, Jordan, thank you for the super chat.

4128
03:35:27,670 --> 03:35:28,210
Thank you.

4129
03:35:28,390 --> 03:35:28,930
Thank you.

4130
03:35:29,210 --> 03:35:29,830
Ha ha ha.

4131
03:35:30,630 --> 03:35:33,570
It's okay, because we're both abusing each other.

4132
03:35:33,890 --> 03:35:35,510
It's balanced, guys.

4133
03:35:35,850 --> 03:35:36,490
It's a...

4134
03:35:36,490 --> 03:35:38,570
It's a balanced relationship.

4135
03:35:38,950 --> 03:35:41,550
Because the abuse goes both ways.

4136
03:35:42,110 --> 03:35:42,430
Ha ha ha.

4137
03:35:42,430 --> 03:35:43,390
Ha ha ha.

4138
03:35:43,990 --> 03:35:44,690
Ha ha ha.

4139
03:35:44,690 --> 03:35:44,750
Ha ha ha.

4140
03:35:45,670 --> 03:35:46,290
Ha ha ha.

4141
03:35:46,290 --> 03:35:46,630
Anyway...

4142
03:35:46,630 --> 03:35:47,650
Anyway, guys...

4143
03:35:48,450 --> 03:35:49,830
Um, I...

4144
03:35:49,830 --> 03:35:51,290
Is there an after-credits scene?

4145
03:35:51,290 --> 03:35:54,650
No, that is not fine, Toki.

4146
03:35:58,910 --> 03:36:01,930
Guys, guys, is there an after-credits scene?

4147
03:36:03,550 --> 03:36:04,270
Guys?

4148
03:36:05,910 --> 03:36:08,350
This is giving me PTSD.

4149
03:36:10,330 --> 03:36:12,310
It's very healthy, guys.

4150
03:36:12,430 --> 03:36:13,470
This is very healthy.

4151
03:36:14,110 --> 03:36:16,050
Is there an after-credits scene, chat?

4152
03:36:18,870 --> 03:36:19,350
No?

4153
03:36:19,710 --> 03:36:21,650
Alright, guys, I'm gonna peace out now.

4154
03:36:21,870 --> 03:36:22,510
Thank you, everyone!

4155
03:36:22,870 --> 03:36:26,170
I would do an after- I would do a Zazzadon, but...

4156
03:36:26,170 --> 03:36:29,190
I'm gonna be- I'm gonna be my head tired.

4157
03:36:29,730 --> 03:36:35,250
Um, but tomorrow- Tomorrow, there is a stream for- on Twitch.

4158
03:36:35,470 --> 03:36:37,050
Tomorrow's stream is on Twitch, by the way.

4159
03:36:37,190 --> 03:36:38,650
For the Fate Trigger Tournament.

4160
03:36:38,970 --> 03:36:40,050
It's on Twitch.

4161
03:36:40,350 --> 03:36:42,970
So, um, I'll see you guys there.

4162
03:36:42,970 --> 03:36:47,770
Next week, I will take a- At least four days off.

4163
03:36:47,890 --> 03:36:50,490
I'll take four days off next week to recharge myself.

4164
03:36:50,950 --> 03:36:57,850
Um, but, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4165
03:36:58,010 --> 03:37:01,830
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

4166
03:37:01,990 --> 03:37:03,810
I'll see you guys next time, everyone.

4167
03:37:04,430 --> 03:37:05,410
Bye, guys!

4168
03:37:05,950 --> 03:37:06,470
Bye!

4169
03:37:06,910 --> 03:37:06,930
Bye!
