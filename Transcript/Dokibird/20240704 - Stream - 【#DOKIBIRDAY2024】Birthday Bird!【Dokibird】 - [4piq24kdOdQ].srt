00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,140
Hello!

2
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,800
Hello everybody!

3
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,800
Oh my god, I don't know why I'm so nervous.

4
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,640
Today I've just been like butterflies.

5
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,920
It's my birthday!

6
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,680
Yes, my real birthday.

7
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,160
Oh my god.

8
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,880
Oh, it's been... what a day.

9
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,940
What a fucking day.

10
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,380
Alright, so...

11
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,120
So, if you guys didn't notice, we have new alerts now.

12
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,520
A huge shoutout to the Dragoons for giving me some new alerts.

13
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,800
We finally updated our new alerts, guys!

14
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:42,280
So we have new alerts for members, gifted memberships, super chats, akasupas...

15
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,100
And streamlabs.

16
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,920
So all of those will be new alerts coming in.

17
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,340
And, oh my god, I...

18
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,880
Thank you guys!

19
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,960
Thank you all for all the birthday wishes, everybody!

20
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,680
I really, really, really do appreciate it, guys.

21
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,640
I wish I had more presents to give you guys.

22
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,200
But I did tell you guys.

23
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,120
I spent majority of the time in terms of like projects and planning.

24
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,580
It was mostly regarding my new skin suit.

25
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,560
So I know I haven't uploaded the wallpapers yet or the 3D models.

26
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,100
All that stuff.

27
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,080
Soon.

28
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,100
This week.

29
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,080
I promise you guys.

30
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,980
This week.

31
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,960
It was just a lot of things back to back to back to back.

32
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,760
So I wasn't able to upload all the stuff yet from the skin suit debut.

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,180
But I will promise you guys that by the end of this week, Dave will be back.

34
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:42,800
And I will be uploaded.

35
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,800
And those are my gifts to you guys.

36
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,480
I also do have special gifts for you guys though.

37
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,640
You see down there at the bottom left side.

38
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,820
At the bottom left side.

39
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,560
I do have some special gifts there.

40
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,880
It might not be as elaborate or like as big as previous birthdays.

41
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,660
But like I tried my best.

42
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,160
There might be...

43
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,380
Some of you guys are like...

44
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,480
Doki.

45
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:23,820
Usually when a Vtuber has a birthday or a special thing going on.

46
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,100
Usually they will release a song or something.

47
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,540
Not today.

48
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,260
But sooner than you think.

49
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,640
But also not as professional as you think it is.

50
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,000
That's all I can say.

51
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,580
That's all I can say about it.

52
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,860
So that's a belated birthday gift I guess.

53
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,460
That's a...

54
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,020
It's gonna be a belated birthday gift.

55
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,320
Because...

56
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,540
You'll see why.

57
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,120
You'll...

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,900
You'll see why.

59
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,740
All I can say is that...

60
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,700
No I don't wanna spoil it.

61
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,220
Fuck.

62
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,500
Okay.

63
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:06,960
I won't...

64
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,660
Nevermind.

65
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,420
I won't spoil it though.

66
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,240
I'm not gonna...

67
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,500
I'm not gonna spoil it.

68
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,060
That's all I can say.

69
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,180
I'm not gonna spoil it.

70
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,340
Soon.

71
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,980
Sooner than you think.

72
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,260
I feel like.

73
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:23,580
Yeah.

74
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,160
Sooner.

75
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,120
Sooner than you think.

76
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,720
Oh my god.

77
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,260
I'm...

78
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:30,940
I'm just...

79
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,320
I don't know.

80
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:31,940
I'm just...

81
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,200
It's been a wild morning.

82
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,960
It's...

83
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,280
It's...

84
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,220
It's...

85
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,180
It's been...

86
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,040
It's been a very wild morning.

87
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,940
I feel like everybody expected some...

88
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,360
Everybody guessed...

89
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,160
A lot of people guessed correctly on, you know, the first announcement.

90
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,320
For those who are not on...

91
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,160
Also thank you everybody for the super chats.

92
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,260
I really, really do appreciate it everybody.

93
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,120
Thank you guys.

94
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,020
Thank you for all the support.

95
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,900
Lord Kurose says thank you for the Akasupa.

96
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:07,760
Thank you.

97
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,340
Thank you.

98
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,160
Happy birthday Doki.

99
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,080
Take your time on all this stuff and just know we appreciate it so much.

100
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,620
Thank you.

101
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,840
Thank you for the Akasupa.

102
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,420
Thank you.

103
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank you.

104
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,200
I really, really, really do appreciate it guys.

105
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:20,600
Okay.

106
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,580
So like for those who are not on Twitter.

107
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,860
Yes, everybody.

108
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:25,980
Okay.

109
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,720
You know how like...

110
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,560
It's so hard to keep this a secret.

111
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,220
Anyway.

112
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,680
So, you know how I tweeted.

113
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,700
I was like, guys, 8 a.m.

114
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,720
And then people were like, what times?

115
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,560
I can't believe some of you guys were like, what time zone?

116
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,380
You guys...

117
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,720
I only work with one time zone.

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,260
I practically exist in PST.

119
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,260
That is my go-to time zone.

120
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,460
I say so much about West Coast, Best Coast.

121
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,940
But it was so funny.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,300
People were like, which time zone?

123
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,660
I'm like, what do you mean which time?

124
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,000
You guys know my default is PST, you guys.

125
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,680
Like...

126
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,660
That is my default.

127
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:04,740
Al so.

128
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,060
Dark Thank you for the Thank you.

129
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,660
Thank you.

130
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,600
Happy birthday.

131
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,780
Thank you.

132
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,420
Thank you for the I really appreciate.

133
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,060
Thank you so much.

134
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,100
Um...

135
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,500
I saw Thank you.

136
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,760
Thank you.

137
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,280
Thank you.

138
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,240
Happy birthday Dokie.

139
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,200
Thank you for the Thank you.

140
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,680
Thank you.

141
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,280
And I feel young.

142
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,140
Thank you for the Thank you.

143
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,620
Thank you.

144
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,220
Speaking of good things coming our way, I do have several announcements, but I have to stall a little bit because...

145
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,560
There are like multiple announcements that I have to make today.

146
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,500
Multiple, uh, really?

147
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,580
Uh...

148
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,260
Oh my gosh.

149
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,740
I know you guys were like, there's more announcements?

150
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,080
Yeah!

151
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,200
I have to stall a little bit.

152
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,300
I don't know when I can make the...

153
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,940
Um...

154
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,720
I'm supposed to make this announcement too, but like...

155
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,180
Uh...

156
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,160
Well, several announcements.

157
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,200
There's already two that's confirmed already that I can make.

158
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,280
But I won't make all the announcements at once.

159
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,480
So I'm stalling until, like, I get confirmation on the final announcement.

160
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,840
Also, daddy, thank you for the 50 gifted chips!

161
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,700
Thank you, thank you!

162
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,500
I fucking...

163
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,800
Okay, not gonna lie.

164
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,680
I fucking love the alert at the bottom left.

165
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,080
Like...

166
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,520
So, um...

167
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,940
Like, even without the music, I can hear it playing.

168
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,320
And I can hear...

169
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,680
I can hear the song in my mind.

170
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,320
But...

171
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,140
Okay, oh my god.

172
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,040
I could, like, hear the music.

173
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,780
Oh my god.

174
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,280
Anyway, but the announcements are unrelated to the gift box over there.

175
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,740
So, like, you see that gift box?

176
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,020
That gift box down there is unrelated to the announcements.

177
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,100
Those are, like, future announcements.

178
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,220
Those are more, like, gift announcements.

179
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,040
Anyway.

180
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
Oh my gosh.

181
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,440
Okay, so, like, you know how, like, yeah, early in the morning...

182
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:55,660
Um...

183
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,640
Uh...

184
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,380
I saw a lot of people that were, like...

185
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,620
Like, 8am?

186
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,120
Can you even wake up at 8am?

187
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,160
True!

188
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,080
True!

189
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,700
That...

190
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,280
I mean, like, that's a...

191
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,760
Cause even you were, like...

192
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,980
Yogi, why would you pick 8am?

193
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,100
Uh...

194
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,740
For whatever secret announcement that is.

195
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,340
And I'm, like...

196
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,040
You think I would pick 8am?

197
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,820
Do you really...

198
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,580
I...

199
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,600
You think I would willingly pick...

200
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,400
8am?

201
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,500
Like, no.

202
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:27,660
Basically...

203
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,860
It was basically...

204
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,460
The reason why it was 8am is because Anime Expo opens at 8am.

205
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,660
And, like, all this stuff there...

206
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,320
It was gonna be shown there anyway.

207
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,620
So they had to announce it before Anime Expo opens.

208
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,220
So, um...

209
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,040
The funny thing is that, uh...

210
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,040
Um...

211
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,600
So, like, the Haya announcement...

212
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,240
A lot of people guessed it correctly.

213
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,040
Cause they were, like, of course it's gonna be the Haya announcement.

214
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,740
Cause we already talked about it before.

215
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,180
Okay.

216
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,420
And, uh...

217
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,540
The thing is...

218
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,340
Sorry, I need to open the door.

219
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,860
Cause it's, like...

220
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,280
I talk so much that there's so much hot air blowing in.

221
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,760
That, like, it's so humid.

222
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,620
It's so...

223
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,260
I...

224
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,080
I'm, like...

225
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,680
I can't breathe.

226
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,780
It's so hot in here.

227
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,540
Um...

228
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,740
But...

229
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,240
Anyway.

230
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,480
Um...

231
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,440
So...

232
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,100
Um...

233
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,480
So...

234
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,460
I suffered a lot with you guys.

235
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,220
With waking up at 8am.

236
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
To be fair, I wake...

237
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,520
I actually woke up at 7 in the morning.

238
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,600
Because...

239
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,360
Like, you know...

240
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,200
When you're so...

241
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,320
Excited.

242
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,300
Uh...

243
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,660
When you're so excited.

244
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,920
And you couldn't sleep.

245
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,860
Um...

246
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,600
So I got, like...

247
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,720
3 to 4 hours of sleep last night.

248
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,720
Because I was just...

249
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,640
Way too excited.

250
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,640
Because...

251
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,900
Nobody expected...

252
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,040
Nobody expected...

253
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,880
The nendoroid.

254
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,580
Yes!

255
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,740
I am gonna be a nendoroid!

256
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,200
Oh my god.

257
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,680
No one...

258
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:57,980
Okay.

259
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,800
Some people were like...

260
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,200
Oh my god.

261
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,740
What if?

262
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,320
But, like...

263
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,400
I don't think in your heart...

264
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,820
You expected a nendoroid announcement.

265
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,540
I am also, like...

266
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,040
In...

267
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,720
You know...

268
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,060
It's...

269
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,040
It's so hard to believe sometimes that...

270
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,700
It's so hard to believe!

271
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,280
I'm gonna be...

272
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,080
I'm gonna be a nendoroid!

273
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,120
Um...

274
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,940
But yes!

275
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,180
Coming soon!

276
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,180
Oh my gosh.

277
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,560
I...

278
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,440
I don't want...

279
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,380
I can't spoil...

280
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,460
What the accessories...

281
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,380
Are gonna be.

282
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,220
But...

283
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,880
Um...

284
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,000
You guys are gonna...

285
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,920
Love...

286
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,560
You guys are gonna love what I picked for the accessories.

287
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,960
And...

288
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,380
Okay.

289
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,360
This is a really funny story.

290
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,160
Uh...

291
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,440
Okay.

292
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:36,920
Okay.

293
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,780
So, not a story.

294
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,600
But, like...

295
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,100
Um...

296
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,280
So, I had...

297
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,500
I looked at the sheet.

298
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,380
So, like...

299
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,660
When they propose...

300
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,020
The nendoroid stuff.

301
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,940
And they propose, like...

302
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,000
The expressions...

303
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,920
And the accessories.

304
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,760
It was so funny.

305
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,640
Because I was reading the...

306
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,220
I was reading the sheet.

307
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,500
And then...

308
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,400
In the notes...

309
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,000
It was like...

310
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,440
Make sure the mouth is slanted.

311
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,290
And like...

312
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:04,950
For like...

313
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,470
All the faceplates...

314
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,450
The notes were like...

315
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,010
Make sure the...

316
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,650
The smile is curved and slanted.

317
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,150
It is not regular face...

318
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,050
Not regular smile.

319
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,930
It has to be slanted.

320
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,650
I thought I was...

321
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,110
I was...

322
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,950
Like...

323
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,590
It was like...

324
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,470
Like a bolded note on the faceplates and everything.

325
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,710
And...

326
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,190
Um...

327
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,530
It was like...

328
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:26,810
It was...

329
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:27,950
Honestly...

330
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,710
Um...

331
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,690
Oh my gosh.

332
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,450
Oh my gosh.

333
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:31,970
I'm just...

334
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,110
I'm just...

335
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,090
Out of words.

336
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,450
Because...

337
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,010
Uh...

338
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,330
It...

339
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,950
I'm not gonna cry.

340
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,730
But I just wanna say...

341
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,550
Um...

342
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,830
Thank you guys so much, Dragoons.

343
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,310
I don't think without you guys...

344
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,550
I could even...

345
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,770
The fact that, like...

346
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,430
I'm an indie VTuber.

347
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,310
And not a lot of indie VTubers...

348
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,650
Get a chance to...

349
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,010
Have a nendoroid.

350
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:55,810
Uh...

351
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,430
Because usually...

352
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,670
When you think of nendoroids...

353
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,410
It would go to, like...

354
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,070
Corporate.

355
00:12:59,130 --> 00:12:59,530
You know?

356
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,550
So...

357
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,190
Like...

358
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,150
The fact that...

359
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,650
Like...

360
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,510
I was able to be...

361
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,070
Like...

362
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,910
Within...

363
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,810
Like, you know...

364
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,690
The rare indies that have the opportunity...

365
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,370
To...

366
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,070
To be a nendoroid...

367
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,910
It is...

368
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,930
Absolutely insane.

369
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,430
And...

370
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,090
Um...

371
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,130
Basically...

372
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:21,810
Um...

373
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,370
They work so...

374
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,150
Fast.

375
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,030
It...

376
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,770
Um...

377
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:26,990
Like...

378
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,190
It was...

379
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,790
They work so...

380
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,590
Cause like...

381
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,270
It's not like...

382
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,190

384
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,670
For like...

385
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,550
A long time...

386
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,110
It was like...

387
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,110
I don't wanna give...

388
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,090
I can't give details...

389
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:39,930
But it was like...

390
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,050
Much faster than I expected...

391
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:43,990
Because...

392
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,410
Um...

393
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,990
This was actually arranged by...

394
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,430
Uh...

395
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,750
This was arranged by...

396
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,470
Uh...

397
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,210
My...

398
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,350
My agent...

399
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,090
And...

400
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,470
Uh...

401
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,770
My new staff team...

402
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,390
Um...

403
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:56,410
Um...

404
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:56,950
So...

405
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,710
My agent and my new staff team...

406
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,790
Worked on the...

407
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,390

408
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:00,950

And...

412
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,210
Like...

413
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,170
I remember they were like...

414
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:05,670
Uh...

415
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,810
They emailed them and be like...

416
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,050
Hey...

417
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:07,930
Do you want to...

418
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,710
Uh...

419
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,170
You know...

420
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:09,910
Doki really...

421
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,730
Really wants...

422
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,430
Uh...

423
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,090
To...

424
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,210
Be a nendoroid...

425
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:13,730
And like...

426
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:14,950
She loves your stuff...

427
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,130
Like...

428
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,170
Are you open to this idea?

429
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:16,810
Of making...

430
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,650
Adding Doki Bear to the indie line...

431
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:18,930
Like...

432
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:19,170
For...

433
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:19,490
Uh...

434
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,090
Vtuber...

435
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,150
Vtuber indies with nendoroid...

436
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,790
And they were like...

437
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,970
Yeah!

438
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:23,710
Like...

439
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,390
Of course!

440
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:24,690
Like...

441
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,050
They were like...

442
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:25,170
Yeah!

443
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,070
We really want to work with her!

444
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,090
And...

445
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:27,750
Um...

446
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:28,930
And...

447
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:29,270
It...

448
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,270
Oh my god!

449
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,530
Uh...

450
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,670
It's just...

451
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,790
Really hard to...

452
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,030
I can't believe they said...

453
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,210
Yeah!

454
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,490
I can't believe they said yes!

455
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,070
And...

456
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,250
At that time...

457
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:44,830
Um...

458
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,030
The original idea...

459
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,650
Was...

460
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,630
To do...

461
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,430
Um...

462
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,150
Was to do...

463
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,130
My new skin suit...

464
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:50,990
Um...

465
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,030
Because at that time...

466
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,290
Like...

467
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,210
Everything was...

468
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,010
Practically...

469
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,490
Like...

470
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,250
Done!

471
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,910
For my new skin suit...

472
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,890
And...

473
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,850
But then they were like...

474
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:59,310
They decided...

475
00:14:59,310 --> 00:14:59,950
We decided...

476
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,150
Like...

477
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,970
All of us decided...

478
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,110
Like...

479
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,890
We talked about it...

480
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,350
And we decided to go with...

481
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,050
The...

482
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,150
Old skin suit...

483
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,350
Um...

484
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,510
Because...

485
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:08,570
Uh...

486
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,710
Because like...

487
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,890
We thought that like...

488
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:11,430
You know...

489
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,810
It would...

490
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,070
Like...

491
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:12,510
Retro...

492
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,430
Retro Doki...

493
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,790
Was a big part of my life...

494
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:15,970
And...

495
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,650
Um...

496
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,350
And then...

497
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,410
That gives me opportunities...

498
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,330
To maybe in the future...

499
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,470
If the cells go really...

500
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,870
Guys...

501
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,450
Hint hint...

502
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,090
Hint hint...

503
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,170
If...

504
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,250
If the cells go...

505
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,450
Really really well...

506
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,850
For Retro Doki...

507
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,230
We might be able to get...

508
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,490
You know...

509
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,150
Hint hint...

510
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,490

511
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,030
Um...

512
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,610
You know...

513
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,830

Um...

517
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,110
I don't know...

518
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,330
I don't know...

519
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:42,490
I don't know...

520
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,350
Hint...

521
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:44,770
Hint...

522
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,670
Hint...

523
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,350
So...

524
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,950
You know...

525
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,650
I have more than...

526
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,570
Just...

527
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,010
Uh...

528
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,310
More than just like...

529
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:51,790
Um...

530
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,490
One version of me...

531
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,310
Um...

532
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,310
As a Nendoroid...

533
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,730
And...

534
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:57,730
So...

535
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,330
Yeah...

536
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:58,990
So that's why...

537
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,830
We decided to go with...

538
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,310
Uh...

539
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,470
Retro Doki...

540
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,450
Um...

541
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,890
And...

542
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,630
Oh my gosh...

543
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:05,950
Like...

544
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,650
It's just...

545
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,150
I...

546
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,790
Like...

547
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,790
When they were like...

548
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,470
They were like...

549
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,950
We're gonna announce it at Anime Expo...

550
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:12,590
And I was like...

551
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,830
That soon?

552
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:15,730
That's...

553
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,270
I...

554
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,650
I legitimately...

555
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,390
Expected it to be...

556
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,850
Announced like...

557
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,130
End of the year...

558
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,730
I did not think it would be like...

559
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,130
They're like...

560
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:26,830
By the way...

561
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,630
We're gonna like...

562
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,650
If everything's good to go...

563
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,450
We're gonna like...

564
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:29,950
Uh...

565
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,550
We're gonna like...

566
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,730
Let people know...

567
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,930
Anime Expo...

568
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,830
And I was like...

569
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,990
I was like...

570
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,510
What?

571
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:39,610
I was like...

572
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,450
I was like...

573
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,630
Oh...

574
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,550
I'm still like...

575
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,570
I'm still living through the rush of...

576
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,310
The fact that I'm a nendoy...

577
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,150
Like...

578
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,370
Oh...

579
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,530
Oh my god.

580
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,110
It's just...

581
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,170
I was not ready.

582
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,410
I was honestly...

583
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,290
I was not ready at all...

584
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,390
Um...

585
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,410
Uh...

586
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,550
But...

587
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,090
It's...

588
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,150
Ugh...

589
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,750
It's...

590
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,930
It was wild...

591
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:08,590
And then...

592
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,430
I told this story at Anime Expo...

593
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:19,710
I was at Expo during my panel and basically they told me that the Nendoroid was going to be announced at 8am.

594
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:25,710
So, you know, Hyatt announced the thing at 8am as well.

595
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,810
And so like, I was like, oh sweet, like the double whammy.

596
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:36,430
And then so like, 8am passed and then I was like, where's Nendoroid?

597
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:42,690
And then everybody, you know, expected the Hyatt thing to be like the last announcement that was going to happen.

598
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:49,010
Because I was like, 8am and like the Hyatt PC collab was like the only thing that came out at 8am.

599
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:54,430
So then I asked my staff and I was like, Also Lita, thank you for the Aka- Aka-Supa!

600
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,690
Thank you, thank you!

601
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,030
Happy birthday Doki!

602
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,130
I'm so happy to see you become such a successful Vtuber!

603
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,470
I hope we can have you for many, many more years.

604
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,290
Thank you, thank you for the Aka-Aka-Supa!

605
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,630
That really, really means a lot.

606
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,250
But basically, so...

607
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,090
I'm a god.

608
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,570
So I messaged my staff.

609
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:25,490
I messaged my staff and I was like, Oh, um, staff, where... where...

610
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,350
Where's the Nendoroid announcement?

611
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,110
Where... where is it?

612
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:37,610
And then my staff that's at Anime Expo was like, Oh, don't worry.

613
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,750
Um, they said it'll be 8.08.

614
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,750
Your tweet is scheduled for 8.08.

615
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,190
And I was like, 8.08?

616
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:44,470
Okay.

617
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,470
Okay, 8.08.

618
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,090
And then 8.08...

619
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:53,010
I was like refreshing the, like, the Good Smile Company Twitter accounts.

620
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,130
I was like refreshing over and over and over again.

621
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,910
Because I was like, where... where...

622
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,430
I need to... I want to... I need to see it!

623
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,870
Like, I need to see it to believe it!

624
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,610
So...

625
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,490
So...

626
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,250
So, 8.08 passed.

627
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,150
And then 8.08 was Iron Mouse's paw figure.

628
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,490
I was like, this is not me.

629
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,790
This is Bishoucho!

630
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,910
I was just like, wait a minute!

631
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,830
Did they think I'm Iron Mouse?

632
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,250
This isn't me!

633
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,810
Iron Mouse is 8.08!

634
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,710
And then I was like, messaged my staff again.

635
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,190
I was like, wha... what?

636
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,830
Where's...

637
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,630
Where's...

638
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:36,990
Where's Nendoroid?

639
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,210
I was like, wait...

640
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,230
Where's Nendoroid?

641
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,450
8.08 was Bishoucho!

642
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,550
And then my staff must reply back.

643
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,530
I was like, oh sorry.

644
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,490
There's like two to three more Bishoucho announcement.

645
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,010
And then it's your turn.

646
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:57,830
And I was like, okay.

647
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,510
Oh my god.

648
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,410
So, I was like, what?

649
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,930
I was waiting in anticipation because I didn't know the exact time.

650
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,150
I didn't know the...

651
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:15,650
I didn't know the exact time of like when it was going to show up.

652
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,710
I just kept refreshing and refreshing and refreshing.

653
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,470
And like getting baited.

654
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,210
And like getting baited.

655
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,350
By other announcements.

656
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,450
Until like I showed up and I was like, it's there.

657
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,750
It's finally there.

658
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:27,950
It's real!

659
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,570
Oh my god!

660
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,690
It's real!

661
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,390
Um...

662
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,230
Oh my god.

663
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,110
I was so...

664
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,410
It was so hard to be patient, you know?

665
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,290
And then...

666
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,530
I had no words.

667
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,590
I honestly...

668
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,670
I have no words.

669
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,910
I was just... I'm there!

670
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,690
And Android is real!

671
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,110
The one thing we're missing now is the Funko Pop.

672
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,030
The one thing we're missing now is the Funko Pop.

673
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,130
When we get the Funko Pop, then we've truly made it.

674
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,870
When we get the Funko Pop, then we've truly made it.

675
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,970
The Triforce.

676
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,950
We have the U2's figure.

677
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,050
We have the Nendoroid.

678
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,610
All we're missing right now is the Funko Pop.

679
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,450
To complete the triangle.

680
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,330
To complete the triangle.

681
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,970
To complete the triangle.

682
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,470
Um...

683
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,530
Hey guys, there were...

684
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,250
There were so many announcements.

685
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,470
So you guys didn't know.

686
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,330
Um...

687
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,330
During the...

688
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,950
Well, I mean, you guys should know because I talked about it during the Skinsuit reveal.

689
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,170
But...

690
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,370
At Anime Expo...

691
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,370
And at the...

692
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:46,850
Um...

693
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,690
And at the...

694
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,210
Oh my gosh, sorry.

695
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,770
It's so hard to talk.

696
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,450
I'm just so...

697
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,510
I'm just so happy.

698
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,970
I'm just really happy right now.

699
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,790
So it's so hard to verbalize my thoughts.

700
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,930
It's so hard to communicate right now.

701
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,010
Um...

702
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,450
And you know, I'm usually really good at yapping.

703
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,090
But like today, I'm just...

704
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,170
My mind is like...

705
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,390
All frazzled.

706
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,050
And um...

707
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,790
Yeah, like...

708
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,410
It's just...

709
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,510
It's so hard to like...

710
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,150
Word anything in my head today.

711
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,190
Because there's just...

712
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,870
There's so many things going on.

713
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,770
And I told you guys to like...

714
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,110
July...

715
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,430
July is crazy.

716
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,970
July is actually crazy.

717
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,010
Thank you everybody.

718
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,150
Thank you guys so much.

719
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,090
For all the birthday wishes.

720
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,430
I really appreciate it.

721
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,630
Um...

722
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,270
Um...

723
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,130
I just...

724
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,350
I never expected to get an Android.

725
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,990
That's really good.

726
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,850
It was honestly like...

727
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,710
A dream of mine.

728
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,990
To get an Android.

729
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,550
I was a Nendoroid collector.

730
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,930
Well, not recently.

731
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,670
I was a lot younger.

732
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,190
I used to collect a lot of Nendoroids.

733
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:10,970
Growing up.

734
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,710
And you know...

735
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,330
It's just so surreal.

736
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,770
To like...

737
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,710
See me as a Nendoroid.

738
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,810
And then like...

739
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:20,650
Oh my gosh.

740
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,890
I'm just like thinking like...

741
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,990
Am I gonna go to a random anime store?

742
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,530
And then I'm gonna see me?

743
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,190
Like...

744
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,990
Like I'm just thinking like...

745
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,710
Oh my god.

746
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,630
Will I like...

747
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,230
Go to some random anime store?

748
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,590
And then I'd be like...

749
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,390
There's me!

750
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,030
It's actually...

751
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,010
It's like... you know...

752
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,670
Real life sighting.

753
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,530
Like you know... Everything for me is just virtual.

754
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:50,230
But to like see a wild Doki IRL...

755
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,810
It's just...

756
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,330
It's gonna be so weird.

757
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,850
It's gonna be so fucking weird.

758
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,230
Um...

759
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:57,910
So...

760
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,190
It is honestly just...

761
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,610
I'm just... I'm so frazzled.

762
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,790
I'm so fucking frazzled right now.

763
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,850
Thank you all for the happy birthday wishes guys.

764
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,570
Thank you all for the birthday wishes.

765
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,450
And all the super chats and the members.

766
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,090
And everything.

767
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,670
I really...

768
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,890
Really appreciate it.

769
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:19,090
Um...

770
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,590
I'm trying not to cry.

771
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,910
I'm trying...

772
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,150
I'm trying not to cry because...

773
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:25,790
You know...

774
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,990
I'm usually not used to having...

775
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,250
So many things happening on my birthday.

776
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,150
Unlike my real birthday.

777
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,810
Unlike my real birthday.

778
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,130
So...

779
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,590
So it's been pretty...

780
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,410
Overwhelming.

781
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,030
And um...

782
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:43,490
Ah!

783
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,050
Okay.

784
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,090
I have to actually move on to the next subject.

785
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,550
Or I'm gonna actually like...

786
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,850
Fucking cry or something.

787
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,490
Oh my god.

788
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,350
Um...

789
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,650
It's just crazy.

790
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,310
To say as an indie.

791
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,630
To have an android as an indie.

792
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:01,910
It's just like...

793
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,150
It's really rare for indies to get an opportunity like this.

794
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:06,850
So...

795
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,610
I'm really thankful to my team.

796
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,950
And to my agent.

797
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,130
To one of my...

798
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,410
One of my three...

799
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,150
My two agents.

800
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,450
For helping me...

801
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,450
Accomplish this.

802
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,030
And reaching out to Good Smile Company.

803
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,510
Asking if they were interested.

804
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,910
And then people at the Good Smile Company be like...

805
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,110
Yeah!

806
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:26,970
Let's do it!

807
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:27,970
And I was like... Really?

808
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,890
You're not fucking with me right?

809
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:30,610
Like...

810
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,310
Ha ha ha ha!

811
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:34,830
Oh...

812
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,010
So...

813
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,010
I'm just really happy.

814
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,810
You guys are gonna love the accessories.

815
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,590
That I picked.

816
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:43,930
Um...

817
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,110
That I picked.

818
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,930
For an android.

819
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,150
You guys are gonna love it.

820
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,170
Um...

821
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:55,430
Alright.

822
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,670
Moving on.

823
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,610
Moving on to the next...

824
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,450
Subject that I should be talking about.

825
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,250
By the way, like I said, um...

826
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,990
The announcements will be at a later time.

827
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,090
Um...

828
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:06,870
Because...

829
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,910
The announcement and what's in the gift will be at a later time.

830
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:11,730
Um...

831
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,730
Because I need to get a final confirmation on one of the final announcements.

832
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:16,650
So...

833
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,430
Right now I'm just talking about all the current announcements that we've had.

834
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:20,730
Um...

835
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:21,950
Anyway.

836
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,910
The other thing is...

837
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,410
Yes!

838
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,110
It is up!

839
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:27,890

843
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:33,670
Okay.

844
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,490
If one of my...

845
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,230
Sorry.

846
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,330
I know like...

847
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,910
Right now there's only one mod at the moment in chat.

848
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,910
So if my one mod can...

849
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:45,130
Can post a link to...

850
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,030

864
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,570

865
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,310

I'm trying to remember everything that was in the bonus collection.

874
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,070
A charm... There's a lot of stuff.

882
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,030

883
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,030
With Hyatt and...

884
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,090
iBipower...

885
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,010
To make it super...

886
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,630
Personalized...

887
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,410
In a way that I think you Dragoons are gonna love.

888
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,330
I mean will love because like...

889
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,910
You can literally see what's like in it.

00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,110
Um...

891
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,810
And...

892
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,310
I'm a keycap collector.

893
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,990
I collect keycaps.

894
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,610
I um...

895
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:14,130
I was very...

896
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:14,890
Very...

897
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,450
Very picky when it came to the keycaps.

898
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:19,470
Um...

899
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,250
Oh shit I'm sorry I dropped my cough drops.

900
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,510
Um...

901
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,270
I was very...

902
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,450
Very like picky and...

903
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,110
Uh...

904
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:32,250
Stingy on like what the...

905
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,850
Keycaps were supposed to look like.

906
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:35,750
Um...

907
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,010
Because like I said like...

908
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,610
I was very particular about it.

909
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,810
And like I...

910
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,430
As someone that loves...

911
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,410
What's the word called?

912
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,390
What's the word?

913
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,510
Uh... Fuck.

914
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,990
The like symbols on keycaps...

915
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:51,370
Oh no.

916
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,050
Guys sorry I'm...

917
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,890
My brain's not working today guys.

918
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,770
My brain's not working today.

919
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,090
Um...

920
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,410
But the...

921
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,790
God what was that word called?

922
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,630
The symbols on the keycaps.

923
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,750
Not the regular ones.

924
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:05,710
The...

925
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,330
What's the keycap?

926
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,830
Keycap words.

927
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,550
Keycap terminologies.

928
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,510
You know like the...

929
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,070
The pretty...

930
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,090
Icons.

931
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,310
The novelties.

932
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,110
Yes!

933
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,990
I'm sorry my brain's not working today.

934
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,310
I'm really overwhelmed everybody.

935
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,170
I'm super overwhelmed today.

936
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,490
But the novelties.

937
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,410
Um...

938
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:28,950
So...

939
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,690
The novelties...

940
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,830
For the keycaps.

941
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,310
I was very very particular on...

942
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,030
What... How it was supposed to look like.

943
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,750
I don't know if I could show the first draft.

944
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,410
But like maybe in the future.

945
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,570
I'll have to ask...

946
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,090
I'll have to ask the people at...

947
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,110
I Buy Power and Hyatt.

948
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,470
Whether or not I can show the very first draft of the keycaps.

949
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,130
Or not.

950
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,710
But I requested...

951
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,610
Very particular novelties.

952
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:58,790
Um...

953
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,550
For this collection.

954
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,570
And I had a huge hand in designing...

955
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,470
A lot of these.

956
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,670
In terms of my vision.

957
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,030
And you guys can see there's a lot of dragoons and everything.

958
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,310
I wanted to include my dragoons and dad.

959
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,450
Um...

960
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,410
I wanted to include as many merch as I can.

961
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,350
Because like you know...

962
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,550
Without my dragoons I can't do the things that I can do.

963
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,930
Like I wouldn't be able to achieve the things...

964
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:21,670
Um...

965
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,430
That I've achieved without your support.

966
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,170
So like I want you guys to be with me on this journey.

967
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,470
And like be with me on my merch and everything.

968
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,610
Like it's not just like a me effort.

969
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,230
It's like a team effort.

970
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,990
Guys remember we are a team.

971
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,530
So any like mistake that I do it is a team.

972
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,070
Hahahaha.

973
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,690
So any mistake that I do...

974
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,730
We did together.

975
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:44,690
Hahahaha.

976
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:49,690
You can't just be in the positives of the team.

977
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:50,230
Okay?

978
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,030
We are there for the negatives as well.

979
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:53,750
Hahahaha.

980
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,010
Hahahaha.

981
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,230
Hahahaha.

982
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,110
Like this is the positive part.

983
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,310
But like you guys have to be there.

984
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,370
When we fuck up too.

985
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,010
Hahahaha.

986
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,050
The shared liability.

987
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:07,690
Anyway.

988
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:07,890
Anyway.

989
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:10,370
Um...

990
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,030
Um...

991
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,450
I'm gonna show you guys the keycaps.

992
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,550
Cause like if you guys didn't see the keycaps.

993
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,130
There's like stuff I wanted to show you guys.

994
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,930
From the keycaps.

995
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,590
So these are the keycaps.

996
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,750
And I want you guys to see down here.

997
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:27,790
Uh...

998
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:30,450
You can see that croaky is...

999
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,250
Okay wait let me...

1000
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,210
Oh so by the way I said I wanted the tomato.

1001
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,590
For this right here.

1002
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,150
Okay oh my gosh you're just like...

1003
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,270
Hahahaha.

1004
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,190
And you guys can see the tomato right here.

1005
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:41,950
I...

1006
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,610
The tomato was not originally in...

1007
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,370
Uh...

1008
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,570
Was not originally in it.

1009
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,990
But like I requested to have like tomato.

1010
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,490
Cause I wanted the keycaps to be like...

1011
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,510
Everything that I've represented.

1012
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,570
Like everything that you dragoons have done.

1013
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,910
Everything that I have done in my career.

1014
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,290
And uh...

1015
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,350
In my very short career of like six months.

1016
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,970
But like this basically...

1017
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,770
The keycaps is basically like...

1018
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:08,010
A piece of history.

1019
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,190
Um streaming.

1020
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,570
And so...

1021
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:14,190
And then we have a tomato goon too.

1022
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:14,730
Right here.

1023
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:17,410
We have a tomato goon as well.

1024
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,750
Uh right here.

1025
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,730
I requested that too.

1026
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,570
I was like I need the tomato goon.

1027
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,450
And then obviously I requested to have...

1028
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,070
Uh the dragoons.

1029
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,590
And the keycaps as well.

1030
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,470
And okay but I need you guys to look at a particular...

1031
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,350
Um...

1032
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,090
A particular...

1033
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,270
Uh...

1034
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:41,890
Um...

1035
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,410
Keycap design.

1036
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,210
Also I love this.

1037
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,370
This one they added in.

1038
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,550
And I was like this is beautiful.

1039
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,250
But I need you guys to see this.

1040
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,170
Uh...

1041
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,130
Okay.

1042
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,070
Okay.

1043
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,090
So...

1044
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,010
Um...

1045
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:03,210
Croaky is in the...

1046
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,070
Uh...

1047
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,090
Keycap collection.

1048
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,010
And I need you guys to know...

1049
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,730
That Croaky...

1050
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,730
Was such a last minute...

1051
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,450
Addition.

1052
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,630
It was literally...

1053
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,810
Okay.

1054
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,130
It was literally added...

1055
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,830
So last minute.

1056
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,350
Um...

1057
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,850
To the point where...

1058
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,730
Cause after I did the croaky stream...

1059
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:30,010
I was like croaky has to be in the keycap collection.

1060
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,930
Like croaky has to be in it.

1061
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,050
And it was so...

1062
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,050
So last minute.

1063
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,630
That because we added croaky in...

1064
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,090
Is the reason why we don't have...

1065
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,370
The samples at anime.

1066
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,330
Because...

1067
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,390
Because they were like it's too late.

1068
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,430
We can't get the samples in time.

1069
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:53,370
By adding croaky we can't get it in time.

1070
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,390
For the convention.

1071
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:55,710
So...

1072
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,030
So that's why...

1073
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,230
That's why there's no keycaps like shown.

1074
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,450
Like physical keycaps shown.

1075
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:03,690
Um...

1076
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:06,110
At the booth at high end.

1077
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,730
Because I demanded for croaky...

1078
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:09,690
To be added.

1079
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,390
To be added in.

1080
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,850
And um...

1081
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,330
And um...

1082
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,270
Like basically...

1083
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,510
Like uh...

1084
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,270
We were gonna add one...

1085
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:24,710
I was like oh I sent screenshots of like croaky...

1086
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,590
Uh pictures.

1087
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,090
Like to potentially be made into...

1088
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:28,910
Keycaps.

1089
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,910
And uh...

1090
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:33,570
And then I was like you know you can pick any one of them.

1091
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,250
And then the staff...

1092
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,250
At high end slash ibuypower...

1093
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,790
Loved the croaky so much.

1094
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:40,930
They were like...

1095
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,070
Let's add all four.

1096
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,850
They were like fuck it.

1097
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:45,670
Let's add more keycaps in there.

1098
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,510
We're gonna add all four croaky's into the collection.

1099
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,230
Because they were just gonna...

1100
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:51,850
We were just gonna...

1101
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:52,630
It was just one.

1102
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:53,890
We were gonna just add one.

1103
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:54,570
But they were like no.

1104
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,190
Let's just add all four of them.

1105
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,170
So...

1106
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:01,350
So...

1107
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:01,550
So...

1108
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,870
I'm really happy that uh...

1109
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,910
I'm really happy croaky made it in.

1110
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,670
Because yeah it was...

1111
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,510
Incredibly last minute.

1112
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,850
I am just as shocked as all of you guys.

1113
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:14,590
I am just as shocked as all of you guys.

1114
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,430
That croaky managed to make it in.

1115
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,670
Like all four of...

1116
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,430
Everybody's like one or two.

1117
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,330
But croaky gets like four.

1118
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,050
I was like wow.

1119
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:26,550
Wow how come your mom lets you have four croaky's.

1120
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:26,910
I don't...

1121
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,750
How come...

1122
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,450
How come they let you have four croaky's.

1123
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,950
Also my oshimark is there too.

1124
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,230
Um...

1125
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,710
But yeah that's...

1126
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,130
It just looks amazing.

1127
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,690
The collection really does look so amazing.

1128
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,550
Like look at...

1129
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,830
Look at the packaging.

1130
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,950
Like what the...

1131
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,990
Oh my god.

1132
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,350
I love the packaging too.

1133
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,970
Like the illustrations.

1134
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,030
I wanna keep the box.

1135
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,310
The box looks amazing.

1136
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,370
And um...

1137
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,130
What else?

1138
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,970
And then there's like the keycaps too.

1139
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,870
This is the keycap box.

1140
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,710
So it's more themed towards the dragoons.

1141
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,090
Cause like I'm on the...

1142
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,590
I'm on the PC box.

1143
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,710
But you guys get to be on the keycaps box.

1144
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,610
So like all the dragoons over here.

1145
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,990
Um and also the packaging for that.

1146
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,190
And oh yeah the wall scroll.

1147
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,470
Oh my gosh.

1148
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,590
The wall scroll.

1149
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,330
Look at that beautiful artwork.

1150
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,830
I wish I could show you guys the drafts.

1151
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,950
It was so difficult to pick.

1152
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,190
Um...

1153
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,310
The artwork for...

1154
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,990
The artwork for this.

1155
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,450
Because like...

1156
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,010
There was like three other poses.

1157
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:42,130
And the reason why I picked this particular pose.

1158
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,050
Was because of the dragoons.

1159
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,670
Because I loved how the dragoons were positioned.

1160
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,710
Because I was like...

1161
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,630
Oh my god the dragoons look amazing.

1162
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,030
I love how the dragoons look amazing.

1163
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,790
And this one.

1164
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,470
I don't care what I...

1165
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,910
I don't care about my poses.

1166
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,290
But the dragoons look so good.

1167
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,430
And that's...

1168
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:04,650
That's why I picked this one particularly.

1169
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:09,030
I just loved how all the dragoons were positioned in the artwork.

1170
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:09,730
I just loved how all the dragoons were positioned in the artwork.

1171
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,970
So um...

1172
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,730
That's why I picked this particular pose.

1173
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,410
And this particular like arrangement.

1174
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,670
Um...

1175
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,510
That's us.

1176
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,110
And then there's the desk mat too.

1177
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,510
So uh...

1178
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,710
If you guys never had a doki desk mat.

1179
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,870
Now is the time to finally own...

1180
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,590
A doki desk mat.

1181
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:29,370
It is...

1182
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,750
Oh my gosh.

1183
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,950
It's still...

1184
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,570
It's really surreal to have like a...

1185
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,210
Gaming gear collection in general.

1186
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,650
Because um...

1187
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:38,930
It's...

1188
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,430
As a gamer it's...

1189
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,070
It's not something that...

1190
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,570
I guess like I think I would have.

1191
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,050
I'm sorry.

1192
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,650
Oh my gosh.

1193
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,810
Sorry that was like...

1194
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,650
It's just like...

1195
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,950
It's just hard to believe like...

1196
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,770
That this is possible.

1197
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,730
And especially keycaps.

1198
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,570
And...

1199
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:05,590
Um...

1200
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,690
Like a PC case and everything.

1201
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,050
Like I remember in the past...

1202
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,330
I would tell you guys like...

1203
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,310
Guys I don't think I'm gonna get a PC case.

1204
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:14,790
Like...

1205
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,930
And um...

1206
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,870
I remember you guys would be like...

1207
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,830
Doki you're gonna get a PC case in the future.

1208
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,730
You're gonna get it.

1209
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:24,490
You're gonna get it.

1210
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,470
And I was like guys I don't know.

1211
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,930
I don't know guys.

1212
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:30,810
And then it's also like one of the reasons why...

1213
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,930
I never upgrade...

1214
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,190
Like before Rest in Peace PC-kun.

1215
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,590
But it's also why...

1216
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,010
PC-kun lived as long...

1217
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,190
As he did.

1218
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,050
Because like I put out hope...

1219
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,150
That um...

1220
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,270
I would one day earn a...

1221
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,270
Um a PC collab.

1222
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,650
Even though PC-kun was dying...

1223
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,050
Was like you know...

1224
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,490
It was dying for a while.

1225
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,010
Even before...

1226
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,330
Six months ago.

1227
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,270
It was dying for a while.

1228
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,030
And PC-kun lived um...

1229
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,470
Way too long for like...

1230
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,710
How little life it has left.

1231
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,930
Um because I've always hoped...

1232
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,950
Like maybe...

1233
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,570
Maybe I'll get a...

1234
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,870
PC collab one day.

1235
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,670
And cause I was like what if I upgrade?

1236
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,870
And then I get like...

1237
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,110
A message being like...

1238
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,330
I got a PC collab for you.

1239
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,310
And then you know I was always like...

1240
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,710
I was so paranoid.

1241
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,630
Cause I was like what if...

1242
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,430
What if I upgrade and then I get that message.

1243
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,530
Like that would be such a waste of money.

1244
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,330
So...

1245
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,350
Um...

1246
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,870
I held hope.

1247
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,670
And it finally...

1248
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,390
It finally happened.

1249
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:44,750
And...

1250
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,470
Oh my god.

1251
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,070
It...

1252
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,430
It finally happened.

1253
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,630
I'm so happy cause it really does look...

1254
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,310
Um...

1255
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,410
It really looks amazing.

1256
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,470
And I cannot wait to see...

1257
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,350
Uh...

1258
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,910
So many dragoons.

1259
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:02,730
Um...

1260
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,230
All the dragoons.

1261
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,150
Not all of them.

1262
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,750
Cause I know it's very expensive.

1263
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,990
But for those who are able to pre-order it.

1264
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:10,990
Uh...

1265
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,710
To be able to you know...

1266
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,130
Like show photos of the builds that you do.

1267
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,950
Or like just show photos of...

1268
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,370
Your keycaps and uh...

1269
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,850
And like the desk mat.

1270
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:21,450
And everything.

1271
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:25,130
And like I said thank you so much to...

1272
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,070
Hiit and uh...

1273
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,610
iBuyPower with working with me on this.

1274
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:30,450
Um...

1275
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:31,590
Especially as an indie.

1276
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,070
It's really...

1277
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,310
It's just really weird.

1278
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,730
To be able to...

1279
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,610
Get all of this as an indie.

1280
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,190
Because you know...

1281
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:43,430
Um...

1282
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,250
I'm like...

1283
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,650
Cause you don't really expect...

1284
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,430
A lot as an indie.

1285
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:53,830
Because you don't have like...

1286
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:56,030
I guess like... corporate backing.

1287
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:58,530
So to be able to accomplish...

1288
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,890
And be able to receive...

1289
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:01,630
Um...

1290
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,650
All these offers from companies.

1291
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,530
Like companies reaching out to us.

1292
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,830
Or we like reaching out to companies and asking if they...

1293
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,770
Are willing to like you know...

1294
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,850
Collab or sponsor.

1295
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:12,210
Um...

1296
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,550
It's so surreal.

1297
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,710
It's so... It's hard to believe sometimes.

1298
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,870
It really is hard to believe.

1299
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,830
It really is hard to believe.

1300
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,510
Um...

1301
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:27,450
And that's why I have a million things going on.

1302
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:27,990
And that's why I have a million things going on.

1303
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:28,350
Because...

1304
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,750
It's like... I'm like thinking like...

1305
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,110
Oh no like...

1306
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:34,070
By next year...

1307
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,950
Will I still have the similar opportunities again?

1308
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:37,970
By next year?

1309
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,070
Or...

1310
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,850
I just want...

1311
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,190
I guess like... What's the word?

1312
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:43,910
I wanna...

1313
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,650
Take the chances as I...

1314
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,710
As I get them.

1315
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,470
Because I don't know when...

1316
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,330
Um... When these like...

1317
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,230
Chances are gonna stop coming.

1318
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,850
So I'm trying... I'm trying...

1319
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,510
That's why I say yes to a lot of things.

1320
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,870
Because like I want to take advantage...

1321
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,850
Of the fact that you know...

1322
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,550
I'm able to do all of this...

1323
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:02,990
Now?

1324
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:04,550
Um...

1325
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,790

Um... I'm so happy.

1335
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,830
I'm really really...

1336
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:25,710
Really happy.

1337
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,750
Um...

1339
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,050
And... Oh my gosh!

1340
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,490
Okay I need to show you... I... I yoinked this from Twitter.

1341
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,250
Whoever took this photo...

1342
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:35,710
Thank you.

1343
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,250
I yoinked this off of Twitter from you.

1344
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,290
But this is basically what...

1345
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:41,410
What the...

1346
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,570
Display looked like.

1347
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:45,310
It had a little... Like a birthday set up.

1348
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,770

1349
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,550

1351
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:53,170
And like this is what it looks like.

1352
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:54,730
Um... So yeah!

1353
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,430
They even got a cake and everything!

1354
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,990
They got a cake and like there's like streamers...

1355
00:42:58,990 --> 00:42:59,570
And balloons.

1356
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,290
And you guys can see everything...

1357
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,850
But the keycaps because of CROQI.

1358
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:03,410
Uh...

1359
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,310
Um...

1360
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:07,930
Everything's here!

1361
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:11,030
Excluding the keycaps but everything's here!

1362
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:12,250
Hahaha!

1363
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:13,590
Hahaha!

1364
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:15,930
You too!

00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:19,090
Can get a triangular PC just like me!

1366
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:20,150
Um...

00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,670

I'm so happy for you and everything you've accomplished.

1372
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:33,510
Uh... You've come so far and I can't wait to see what comes next.

1373
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,790
We're all proud of you by the way.

1374
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:36,430
Uh...

1375
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,490

1376
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:38,550
Thank you for the Akasupa!

1377
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:39,110
Thank you!

1378
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:39,710
Thank you!

1379
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,130
Oh okay so...

1380
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:43,370
Alright...

1381
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,730
Um... This is a FOMO story.

1382
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:46,910
But like...

1383
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,170
I now have a new FOMO story.

1384
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,370
So if you're at a...

1385
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,790
I will never tell this on stream.

1386
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:53,670
So...

1387
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:56,450
It will die with me on stream.

1388
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:57,510
But...

1389
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:00,910
If...

1390
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:03,290
If you're at a convention...

1391
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,190
If you're at a convention...

1392
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:06,490
Um...

1393
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:08,830
And you want more FOMO stories...

1394
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,430
I have a new one now.

1395
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:11,990
I have a new...

1396
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:14,810
I have a new one.

1397
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,010
I have a new one.

1398
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:20,850
I have two...

1399
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:21,430
I have two...

1400
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:21,990
Guys I did it!

1401
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,730
Now I have two FOMO stories!

1402
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:24,550
Let's go!

1403
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:27,950
Andrew thank you for the 50 gifted ships!

1404
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:28,370
Thank you!

1405
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:28,930
Thank you!

1406
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,470
I really appreciate it!

1407
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,390
Thank you so much!

1408
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,110
Thank you!

1409
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,530
Um... Why do you hate us?

1410
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:37,090
Okay...

1411
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,470
Because some of you guys were like...

1412
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:42,470
But Doki... You haven't announced any conventions!

1413
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:43,930
In Asia!

1414
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:47,210
Great segue!

1415
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,130
How am I supposed to...

1416
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,070
How am I supposed to like...

1417
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:53,530
Get those FOMO stories...

1418
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:56,050
When all your conventions are in Europe...

1419
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:56,970
And in Australia!

1420
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,330
Good question!

1421
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:00,650
Good question over there!

1422
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:01,250
Nice segue!

1423
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:04,370
YouTuber fan number 13...

1424
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,070
Um...

1425
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:11,490
I will make my first announcement!

1426
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,010
I will make my first announcement!

1427
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,830
I'm still gonna stall for the other announcements...

1428
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:14,390
But like...

1429
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:16,710
Um... I think I can make my first announcement...

1430
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,630
Because this one was like...

1431
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:20,070
This one has been confirmed that I can announce it!

1432
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:23,030
You guys might have already saw the hints for it already!

1433
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:24,390
Um...

1434
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:26,110
But...

1435
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:27,290
Um...

1436
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:32,270
I will be at Malaysia!

1437
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:33,510
I will be at Malaysia!

1438
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:33,930
Yeah!

1439
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:35,530
That's me!

1440
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:36,350
That's me!

1441
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,170
I...

1442
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,110
I...

1443
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,890
Will be in...

1444
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:44,470
Malaysia!

1445
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:46,210
For any...

1446
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:49,210
I'm so sorry if I'm pronouncing it wrong...

1447
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,010
Sorry I said right but that's not it...

1448
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:53,930
I can't even... I can't even word that correctly...

1449
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:55,470
But...

1450
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:57,670
I will be at this convention...

1451
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:00,010
On August 23rd to 25th...

1452
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:01,530
Oh my gosh...

1453
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,310
There will be actual...

1454
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:05,950
There will be merch sold there...

1455
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:06,690
As well!

1456
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:08,990
So I'm actually super excited...

1457
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:11,470
Um... I saw previews of the...

1458
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:14,430
Um... Of the merch that will be sold...

1459
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,950
At this convention...

1460
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:16,910
In Malaysia...

1461
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:20,090
So... Oh my gosh I'm so excited for you guys to see it...

1462
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:20,690
But yes!

1463
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:21,190
Finally!

1464
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:24,110
I can announce some of my...

1465
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,450
Asia conventions!

1466
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:26,850
Um...

1467
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,610
We were missing Asia...

1468
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,530
Because we already went to Europe...

1469
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,070
We already went to Australia...

1470
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,770
Canada and the United States...

1471
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:37,450
I'm very sorry South America...

1472
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:38,290
But you really...

1473
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:40,090
But like...

1474
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:43,730
I don't know who to approach regarding...

1475
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:45,490
South America conventions...

1476
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:48,270
And we haven't had any South American conventions approach us...

1477
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,430
I'm very sorry...

1478
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,150
Latin America bros...

1479
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:52,370
I'm very sorry...

1480
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:55,430
Um...

1481
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:58,770
Um...

1482
00:46:58,770 --> 00:46:59,130
Um...

1483
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,010
But...

1484
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:02,390
Um... We have another convention...

1485
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:04,010
To announce for...

1486
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:05,450
The Doki World Tour!

1487
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:06,450
Yeah!

1488
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:08,830
Um...

1489
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,770
We are losing...

1490
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:12,730
Hahaha...

1491
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,710
I can't come to Brazil...

1492
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:19,090
If nobody requests me to come to Brazil...

1493
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:20,010
Hahaha...

1494
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,750
Hahaha...

1495
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,030
How do I go to Brazil...

1496
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:26,140
If I'm not getting requested...

1497
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:27,870
Um...

1498
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:28,450
Hahaha...

1499
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,630
Anyway...

1500
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:32,150
Anyway...

1501
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:36,270
This is one of the many announcements...

1502
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:38,410
That I'm going to be making today...

1503
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:42,590
Because we had a really great segue into this...

1504
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:43,170
Um...

1505
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:45,090
Regarding FOMO Stories...

1506
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:45,630
And...

1507
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,010
I'm really really excited to...

1508
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:50,490
Um...

1509
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,410
Go to Animagaki...

1510
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,550
I'm so sorry if I'm pronouncing it wrong...

1511
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,570
You know my pronunciation is not great...

1512
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:57,210
Hahaha...

1513
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:57,930
Hahaha...

1514
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:01,770
Am I pronouncing it correct?

1515
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:02,630
I don't know...

1516
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,610
I'm sorry...

1517
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:05,950
Um...

1518
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:07,970
Um...

1519
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:09,430
Oh my gosh...

1520
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:10,490
Also...

1521
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:13,630
This other one that was confirmed to me...

1522
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:15,630
That I can announce about it...

1523
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:16,530
Uh...

1524
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,350
Is that...

1525
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:22,690
I can't fully announce what it is...

1526
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:24,150
But...

1527
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:24,710
I'm going to announce...

1528
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,430
Dragon's in Korea!

1529
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:27,690
Hahaha...

1530
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,180
Dragon's in Korea!

1531
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,920
Uh...

1532
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,100
There is...

1533
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,480
Maybe something happening in Korea...

1534
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,680
Soon as well...

1535
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,260
Hahaha...

1536
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,340
So...

1537
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,060
There will be a special event...

1538
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,180
In Korea as well...

1539
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,100
So...

1540
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,140
That's another thing to...

1541
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:53,940
Uh...

1542
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,080
To look forward to...

1543
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,300
Can't really announce more details about it...

1544
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:58,840
Because...

1545
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,980
That's the only thing I can say...

1546
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,400
That's literally the only thing I can say...

1547
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,420
About that event...

1548
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,660
I have no graphics for it...

1549
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,370
Told you!

1550
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,810
When I say World Tour...

1551
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:16,690
I mean it!

1552
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,510
I mean World Tour...

1553
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:19,210
Guys...

1554
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:20,310
I did say...

1555
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:21,750
If I mean World Tour...

1556
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,450
It is going to be a World Tour...

1557
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:27,450
I want to be involved in as many places...

1558
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:28,730
As possible...

1559
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,370
I want to come to as many...

1560
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:32,770
As many places as I can...

1561
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:36,270
To meet all the dragoons from around the world...

1562
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:36,810
Um...

1563
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:38,950
Because...

1564
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:39,550
Uh...

1565
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:41,450
Because like...

1566
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:42,010
You know...

1567
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:45,570
I never really had that chance in the past...

1568
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:48,290
It was very rare for me to be able to...

1569
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:50,890
Talk to my dragoons personally...

1570
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:51,970
And like...

1571
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,370
Just like...

1572
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:56,990
More personalized talks with dragoons...

1573
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:59,210
And being able to see that you guys are real...

1574
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:00,610
And like you are not like...

1575
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,990
You are not like chatbots...

1576
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:04,650
Hahahaha...

1577
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:06,750
I am like...

1578
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:07,930
Oh my god...

1579
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:10,710
They are not fucking bots...

1580
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,710
They are not AI...

1581
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,950
Like my mom didn't buy...

1582
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,830
A thousand AI bots...

1583
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:17,710
To talk to me...

1584
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:20,070
But in my chat...

1585
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:22,090
They are real people...

1586
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,350
They are actually real...

1587
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:26,670
Hahahaha...

1588
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:26,690
Hahahaha...

1589
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:29,890
Um...

1590
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:31,050
That's why...

1591
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:32,050
Okay...

1592
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:33,410
Truth be told...

1593
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:39,090
I don't know if this is similar to other Vtubers...

1594
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,130
But like...

1595
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:43,290
I personally think that like...

1596
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,550
Conventions...

1597
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,050
I don't really...

1598
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:47,470
In terms of like...

1599
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,010
I don't really go overtime as well...

1600
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,050
At conventions...

1601
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,030
You know...

1602
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:52,470
I would have like...

1603
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:58,610
Like a set time...

1604
00:50:58,610 --> 00:50:59,990
That I am supposed to end it off...

1605
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,150
But I tend to go overtime...

1606
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:03,890
And I tend to stay much longer...

1607
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,890
Than like what is...

1608
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:07,210
You know...

1609
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:09,130
What was agreed upon...

1610
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:10,870
Like officially...

1611
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:12,190
Because you know...

1612
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:14,470
I really enjoy meeting my dragoons...

1613
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:16,310
And I really enjoy talking to them...

1614
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:19,710
And meeting them...

1615
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:20,290
And everything...

1616
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:21,330
And...

1617
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,290
I would say that like...

1618
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,130
I personally think...

1619
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,210
In general...

1620
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:33,290
I definitely make more money...

1621
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,430
If I just stream...

1622
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,170
Versus like doing conventions...

1623
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:38,150
In terms of like...

1624
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,810
Superchat Avenue and stuff like that...

1625
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:41,790
Or taking other...

1626
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:44,070
Maybe if I have a sponsored stream at that time...

1627
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:44,670
Or anything...

1628
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:47,450
But... I don't care about that...

1629
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,230
I don't care about that...

1630
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:53,430
I...

1631
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:55,370
Even then...

1632
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:58,870
We've actually negotiated with conventions...

1633
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,230
They're like...

1634
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:03,910
The appearance fee might be too high for them...

1635
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,270
Depending on like...

1636
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:06,970
Exchange rate...

1637
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:07,770
And stuff like that...

1638
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:09,970
Because my appearance fee is based off of...

1639
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:11,670
US dollars...

1640
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,550
And...

1641
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:15,150
And...

1642
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,390
Because of that...

1643
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,350
Some places might not be able to...

1644
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:19,050
Afford like...

1645
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:20,470
The exchange rate...

1646
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,930
Being fucked with every other country...

1647
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:24,210
But the US dollar...

1648
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,730
Fucking US...

1649
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,990
I feel like...

1650
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:33,470
Every country but US...

1651
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:34,690
Has had like...

1652
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:37,950
The currency exchange rate...

1653
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,710
Is not doing great...

1654
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:40,050
But...

1655
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:42,590
Unless you're from US...

1656
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:44,790
I've had moments...

1657
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:46,330
Where...

1658
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:46,930
Where...

1659
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:48,530
USA...

1660
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,870
USA...

1661
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:53,510
Other than...

1662
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:53,970
No!

1663
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,630
You have to see the exchange rate...

1664
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:57,950
Of Euros...

1665
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:59,670
Versus US dollars...

1666
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:00,990
Because like...

1667
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:03,010
The Euro is falling now...

1668
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:04,870
The Euro...

1669
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:07,790
The Euro is like...

1670
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,110
Falling too...

1671
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:11,970
Because I was sending money...

1672
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:13,090
Over...

1673
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:15,450
Because...

1674
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:16,970
My friends...

1675
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,110
One of my like...

1676
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:20,330
Friends...

1677
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,230
Was like...

1678
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,770
Hey I bought you something...

1679
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:28,150
But like...

1680
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:29,350
You gotta pay me back...

1681
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:30,590
So I can ship it...

1682
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:31,010
And I was like...

1683
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:33,910
Wait...

1684
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:36,830
It's not expensive...

1685
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:39,890
I was so surprised...

1686
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:41,090
I was so surprised...

1687
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:43,270
Because it used to be more expensive...

1688
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:45,210
So I was like... Oh my god...

1689
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:47,710
It's happening...

1690
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:51,050
It's happening...

1691
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:51,670
I was like...

1692
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:53,190
It's happening...

1693
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:56,570
The Euro is finally falling...

1694
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:59,210
The Euro is finally falling...

1695
00:53:59,210 --> 00:53:59,670
The Euro is finally falling...

1696
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:01,510
The Euro is finally falling...

1697
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:04,130
Not the Euro 2...

1698
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:04,810
Not the Euro 2...

1699
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:07,090
Oh my god...

1700
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,190
I'm truly in the...

1701
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:12,210
This is why I always ask for...

1702
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:13,350
US dollars...

1703
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:18,090
I'm truly in the...

1704
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:18,610
Anyway...

1705
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:21,870
Wait...

1706
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,830
That's not good...

1707
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:25,870
Okay...

1708
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:26,810
Anyway...

1709
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:29,530
As I was saying...

1710
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:31,430
Fuck...

1711
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:34,590
I have a convention...

1712
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:35,970
I don't think...

1713
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:37,990
The exchange rate is really high...

1714
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:39,350
For this type of fee...

1715
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:43,170
I told my staff team...

1716
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,810
That I'm very open to negotiate...

1717
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:47,610
Regarding appearance fees...

1718
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:48,590
Just because...

1719
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:49,370
Like I said...

1720
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:51,430
Honestly...

1721
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:53,760
My top priority is...

1722
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:55,430
Meeting my dragoons...

1723
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:56,670
From around the world...

1724
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:58,610
So I'm doing meet and greets...

1725
00:54:58,610 --> 00:54:59,590
And doing panels...

1726
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:02,470
All sorts of things...

1727
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,730
At the convention...

1728
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:06,450
I don't make much...

1729
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,770
I put a lot more investment...

1730
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:09,550
Into...

1731
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:11,770
Even despite...

1732
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:14,830
If we agreed upon this...

1733
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:15,630
I tend to go...

1734
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:16,870
Over time...

1735
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:17,950
Just because...

1736
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,190
I feel like...

1737
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,030
I just want you guys to have a great experience...

1738
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:25,550
It's very rare to be able to have this opportunity...

1739
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:26,970
Especially like...

1740
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:29,270
Meet and greets...

1741
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:31,710
Because in meet and greets...

1742
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:32,730
It's like...

1743
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:35,450
It's very hard stop...

1744
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:37,290
You guys fight for it...

1745
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:42,190
You guys...

1746
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:43,630
You guys...

1747
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,230
You guys fight for those slots...

1748
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:46,510
So that's why...

1749
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,790
I remember in like...

1750
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,270
I went like...

1751
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:52,330
I went like...

1752
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:54,430
An hour plus over time...

1753
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:56,410
Because there was like...

1754
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:58,450
It was like...

1755
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:00,030
It was just lined up...

1756
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,150
It was not paid or anything...

1757
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:04,690
There was still a lot of dragoons there...

1758
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:05,410
And then I was like...

1759
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:06,730
Are you okay with going overtime?

1760
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:07,330
I was like...

1761
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:07,610
Yeah...

1762
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:12,650
I remember it was day 2...

1763
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:15,070
And then my staff member...

1764
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:15,730
Was like...

1765
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:18,750
You went overtime...

1766
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:20,870
On day 1...

1767
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:22,450
But we don't want your voice...

1768
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:23,470
We don't want you to burn out...

1769
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,490
Because at that time...

1770
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:28,150
My voice was starting to die a little...

1771
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:29,390
So my staff member was like...

1772
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:31,090
We got a cap for the second day...

1773
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:35,090
My staff member was like...

1774
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:37,270
Okay we got a cap for Doki...

1775
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,750
Because she can't do that twice...

1776
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,310
Because we don't want...

1777
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:41,950
She has like...

1778
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,090
She has dokami...

1779
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:47,710
It was also because I had dokami...

1780
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,730
Right after that too...

1781
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:50,550
So...

1782
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,290
So they were like...

1783
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:54,770
We can't do overtime for day 2 Doki...

1784
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:55,510
We are sorry...

1785
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:57,930
You have to sleep early...

1786
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:00,090
So you can make it to dokami as well...

1787
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:04,910
So I'm sorry that we had to cut the line...

1788
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:06,170
On day 2...

1789
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,690
But it was great...

1790
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:12,310
I'm just really happy to be able to do all these conventions...

1791
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:12,730
And...

1792
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:15,310
I can't wait to do many many...

1793
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:17,430
Many many many many many more...

1794
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:18,330
I want to...

1795
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:19,450
For you guys...

1796
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:22,530
Alright so...

1797
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:25,410
I have other stuff to talk about...

1798
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:27,570
There's still like a couple of more announcements...

1799
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:27,850
There's...

1800
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:31,670
There's still like...

1801
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:32,990
A couple of more announcements...

1802
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:33,950
To go...

1803
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,350
Okay let me see...

1804
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:37,790
Oh...

1805
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:38,990
Oh my gosh...

1806
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:41,150
It's...

1807
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:44,750
It's my birthday...

1808
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:45,830
I'm gonna...

1809
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:46,850
Give me a sec guys...

1810
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:50,990
I'm gonna open the window...

1811
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:52,610
Because it is getting like really...

1812
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:53,950
Lots of hot air...

1813
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:55,930
I'm talking so much...

1814
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,270
I'm yapping so much...

1815
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:58,730
So I'm gonna open the window real quick...

1816
00:57:58,730 --> 00:57:59,730
I'll be right back...

1817
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:04,830
I mean I'm still here... You can hear me from far away... I can't open my window...

1818
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:09,840
Alright...

1819
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,240
There we go...

1820
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,580
Alright...

1821
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,560
I think it's also because I'm like...

1822
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,160
Super nervous today...

1823
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,100
Like... I have...

1824
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,320
So much...

1825
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,560
Butterflies going on in my stomach...

1826
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,720
So like I feel...

1827
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,420

00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:30,620
I just feel a lot more...

1829
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,680
Like... nervous today...

1830
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,180
And it's just a lot of excitement...

1831
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,140
And everything because...

1832
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:36,960
Oh...

1833
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,180
It's just...

1834
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:40,840
There's so many announcements...

1835
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,180
There's so many announcements to do...

1836
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:45,000
There's so many things to talk about...

1837
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,380
And...

1838
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,160
It's crazy...

1839
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,260
It's really crazy...

1840
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,460
Um...

1841
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:54,960
Okay...

1842
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,060
Alright...

1843
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,660
Okay... You know what?

1844
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,900
I can show you one of the GIFs...

1845
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,000
We'll do one of the GIFs too...

1846
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,620
It's like... I don't wanna overwhelm you with announcements...

1847
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,140
Back to back to back to back...

1848
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:10,620
So...

1849
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,840
So...

00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,860
We're gonna like...

1851
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,120
Make sure...

That like...

1853
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:20,360
We pace ourselves a little bit when it comes to these announcements...

1854
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,980
So let me bring the GIF box over...

1855
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:23,800
So...

1856
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,180
As you guys can see...

00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,640
We have a little present!

1858
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,180
A little present...

1859
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,340
For you guys...

00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:34,660
Alright so... I hope I bring out the right present...

Um... But like... I guess like...

There's a third one... But it's not like in the box...

Let's see... I hope this is the correct...

1880
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:10,860
Is this the correct one?

1881
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:11,960
Oh my gosh... Oh yes!

1888
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:23,660
Um...

1889
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,280
You know how there's like...

1890
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:27,560
Birthday merch...

1891
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:29,020
So...

1892
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:31,600
Yaaaaay!

1893
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:34,420
Hahahaha...

1894
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:37,560
So!

1895
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,620
This won't be sold yet.

1896
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:48,700
The reason being is that...

1897
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,180
I know like, oh you put it out today.

1898
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,620
You know, a lot of dragoons are gonna buy it and everything.

1899
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,360
A lot of merch is being brought out now.

1900
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,720
There's the U2s.

1901
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,200
There's the Hyatt stuff.

1902
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,840
There's the Nendoroid.

1903
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,980
Okay, Nendoroid's pre-order is not out yet.

1904
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,680
But you know what I mean.

1905
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:16,520
There's a lot of merch coming out in general.

1906
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:17,260
Especially Hyatt.

1907
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:19,600
The Hyatt collab is very expensive.

1908
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:25,180
So I decided that I'm gonna wait a little bit.

1909
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:30,540
So that, you know, I want you guys to spend money on yourselves.

1910
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,280
And you know, be able to save money and everything.

1911
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:34,700
And you know, be able to save money and everything.

1912
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,860
And so it was like...

1913
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:41,760
That's also why I haven't released the BattleBirds merch as well.

1914
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,300
And it's always like pay rent.

1915
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:45,760
Because like 300 plus dollars, it's a lot.

1916
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:46,480
It's a lot.

1917
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,840
Especially if you convert it to other currencies.

1918
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,680
Especially if you convert it to other currencies and everything.

1919
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,700
I felt like 300 dollars plus, it is a lot of money.

1920
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,840
And like, I'm not here to really make...

1921
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:04,600
Like, I'm not here to be like profit, profit.

1922
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,340
Profit, profit, profit.

1923
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,240
Like...

1924
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,440
And...

1925
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:12,880
Even if you pre-ordered this on my birthday, it's not gonna arrive on my birthday.

1926
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,360
Because my birthday is gonna be over in a couple of hours.

1927
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:19,220
So I felt like you guys can wait a little longer.

1928
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,180
Since like, when this is...

1929
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,300
Like when this comes out.

1930
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,260
Um...

1931
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:24,960
You know.

1932
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:25,940
Um...

1933
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:27,060
When like people actually...

1934
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:27,500
When people...

1935
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,960
If you order it today, it's not even gonna arrive today.

1936
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:36,100
So...

1937
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:37,200
That's why.

1938
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,000
But I did want to show you guys.

1939
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,220
Like we did have like a birthday merch plan.

1940
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:46,420
But I decided that I wanted to like...

1941
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,160
Pace the merch line more.

1942
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:54,260
Due to the fact that, you know, we have the Hyatt Collab pre-orders came out today.

1943
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,800
And there's so many other merch stuff and everything.

1944
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,420
And also I literally just sold the acrylic stands and everything.

1945
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:06,080
So that's why I decided not to sell it.

1946
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,200
And I decided that I wanted to sell the birthday merch today.

1947
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:09,120
Um...

1948
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,460
I also want to flesh it out a little bit more.

1949
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:12,560
Um...

1950
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:12,960
But yes.

1951
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:15,760
There will be a limited set of these as well.

1952
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,480
Where I'll be sending like a signed copy of this.

1953
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:20,320
Because I'm planning...

1954
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,040
I'm deciding...

1955
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:21,560
At the...

1956
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,000
Um...

1957
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,820
Because like I decided not to sell it.

1958
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:28,420
I'm trying to like finalize and put more care into my birthday merch as well.

1959
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:29,440
Um...

1960
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,640
But I do have plans to make a limited...

1961
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,660
Like there's a limited edition set and there's a normal set.

1962
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,060
The limited edition set will be signed.

1963
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,240
And the normal set will be like...

1964
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:37,620
You know...

1965
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:38,660
Just unsigned.

1966
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:44,350
And...

1967
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:45,030
So yes.

1968
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:48,590
That's why I decided not to put the birthday merch up yet.

1969
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:49,470
Um...

1970
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:50,450
Just because like I said...

1971
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:51,090
There's...

1972
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:53,490
A lot of things...

1973
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:57,050
Being sold under the Doki Bird brand.

1974
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:58,950
And I don't want to like...

1975
01:03:58,950 --> 01:03:59,190
You know...

1976
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:00,610
I'm not here to be like...

1977
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:02,790
I'm not here to be like...

1978
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:03,950
Give me all your money.

1979
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:07,250
It's not like...

1980
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:08,390
I...

1981
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:10,210
You guys supported me so much.

1982
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:11,030
And...

1983
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:12,550
You guys supported me so much already.

1984
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:14,650
And because of that...

1985
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:15,070
I...

1986
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:16,210
Like I said...

1987
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:17,090
I didn't want to...

1988
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:18,570
I didn't really want to...

1989
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:19,450
Uh...

1990
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:22,210
Force you guys to like spend more.

1991
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:24,870
Regarding...

1992
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:25,910
Regarding this.

1993
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:26,550
But...

1994
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:27,430
Isn't it cute?

1995
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:29,010
You guys are all in there too.

1996
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:31,610
I requested every dragoon.

1997
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:32,930
Um...

1998
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:33,330
I'm not sure.

1999
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:33,610
I'm not sure.

2000
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:33,870

Be too overwhelming to you guys.

01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,690
Also the other reason...

2067
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,390
You guys were like...

2068
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:56,930
My wallet!

2069
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:59,230

Hahaha!

2071
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:01,510
Hahaha!

2072
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:01,690
Hahaha!

2073
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:01,930
Hahaha!

2074
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:04,420
Haha!

2075
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,500
Okay, funny story!

2076
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,300
By the way, the Minecraft server stream is a public stream.

2077
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:17,080
The only like exclusive part of it is the fact that it's only members will be white listed to be able to join the Dragoon server.

2078
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,760
But the stream itself is a public stream.

2079
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:20,780
Um...

2080
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:21,960
Okay, but funny story.

2081
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,080
So...

2082
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:24,300
Apparently...

2083
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:29,580
There was I think 12 of you guys that broke into the server.

2084
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:30,440
Hahaha!

2085
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,040
Hahaha!

2086
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:32,560
Hahaha!

2087
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:33,080
Hahaha!

2088
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,200
So, or 15.

2089
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:38,920
Okay.

2090
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:39,660
Yes.

2091
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:47,240
Apparently, 15 of you guys broke into the server before the server was supposed to launch.

2092
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:56,060
And I only found out because you guys, like, posted pictures of it on Twitter.

2093
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:03,440
So, like, you know, after, like, behind-scenes work, I was, like, looking through Twitter.

2094
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:12,680
And, like, I saw my For You page of people taking screenshots of the server being like, I beat the Ender Dragon.

2095
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,440
We beat the Ender Dragon.

2096
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:15,960
And I was like, what?

2097
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,260
Is this my Minecraft server?

2098
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:21,600
I said, so, in two hours.

2099
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,700
You guys beat the Ender Dragon in two hours?

2100
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:31,520
Guys, this is supposed to be, like, a multi-month project.

2101
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:32,420
Anyway.

2102
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,420
So, I messaged my...

2103
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,060
I messaged my...

2104
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,680
The Minecraft team.

2105
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,600
And they were like, what the fuck?

2106
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:48,220
They were like, that's not supposed to happen.

2107
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:53,000
And then I messaged the team, the Minecraft team.

2108
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:54,520
And they were like, we're so sorry.

2109
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:55,620
Like, we don't know why.

2110
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:56,940
The whitelist just didn't work.

2111
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:02,000
And so, like, so they apparently, one of them, like, went in and kicked all of you guys out.

2112
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:03,660
And the world is reset.

2113
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,640
It's reset now.

2114
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,840
But they reset everything.

2115
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:06,580
So, don't worry.

2116
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,460
Like, you guys can beat the Ender Dragon again in two hours.

2117
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:09,840
Like...

2118
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:16,820
Anyway.

2119
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Anyway, everything is reset now.

2120
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,620
So, you've lost all your progress.

2121
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,640
You have to do it all over again.

2122
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,320
That's what you get for breaking in.

2123
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:28,720
Um...

2124
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,160
So...

2125
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:32,300
Um...

2126
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:32,960
Anyway.

2127
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,380
So, the server is fully reset now.

2128
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,800
Everything is reset.

2129
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:40,340
Like, all the stuff you had in there is gone.

2130
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,800
So, the Ender Dragon is back.

2131
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:45,620
Um...

2132
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:46,280
And everything.

2133
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,360
But yes, they fixed it.

2134
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:49,800
The whitelist works now.

2135
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:50,660
Um...

2136
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,740
I didn't know the whitelist didn't work.

2137
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:53,820
I was already whitelisted.

2138
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,840
So, like, how was I supposed to know that, like...

2139
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:00,380
When I joined in, I assumed the whitelist was working.

2140
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:01,680
Because they told me...

2141
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,400
Uh...

2142
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,660
Oh, yeah, you're whitelisted now.

2143
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:07,200
But apparently, for some reason, it just stopped working.

2144
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:08,180
Hahaha.

2145
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:11,690
Hahaha.

2146
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:12,890
Hahaha.

2147
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:14,090
Hahaha.

2148
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:14,390
Hahaha.

2149
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:17,850
But at least it was 14 of you guys.

2150
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:20,490
So, you guys were, like, literally the beta testers.

2151
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:21,610
It's like...

2152
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:22,670
It's like those, like...

2153
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:23,490
Um...

2154
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:24,190
What is it called?

2155
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:26,710
Those, like, hackers that do it for good.

2156
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:28,970
Like, they're just hacking the show to them.

2157
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:30,530
Like, oh, your data is compromised.

2158
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:32,250
Like, we only hacked you.

2159
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:34,570
So, we can tell you that your data...

2160
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:36,970
Your security is compromised.

2161
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:39,950
And, like, we want you to improve your security.

2162
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:40,750
Hahaha.

2163
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:43,370
Hahaha.

2164
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:44,130
Yeah.

2165
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:45,170
Yeah.

2166
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:45,690
I was like...

2167
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:46,530
I was like, what the f...

2168
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:47,230
What do you...

2169
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:50,010
I was like, what do you mean you beat the Ender Dragon?

2170
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:51,470
And I looked through the tweets.

2171
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:56,330
They're like, we got into the Minecraft server two hours later.

2172
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:58,730
We beat the Ender Dragon.

2173
01:09:59,070 --> 01:09:59,930
And I'm like...

2174
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:01,010
I was like...

2175
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:01,550
What?

2176
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:06,130
What do you mean you beat the Ender Dragon?

2177
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:07,390
Hahaha.

2178
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:12,750
Thank you for the aqua soup.

2179
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:13,550
Thank you.

2180
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:14,110
Thank you.

2181
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:15,030
Bye, tomato.

2182
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:15,970
Thank you.

2183
01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:16,850
Thank you for the aqua soup.

2184
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:17,590
Thank you.

2185
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:18,050
Thank you.

2186
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:19,650
Guys, I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick.

2187
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:20,250
Give me a sec.

2188
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:21,130
I'll be right back, guys.

2189
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:21,890
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

2190
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:23,650
Bathroom break.

2191
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:24,230
Stay hydrated.

2192
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:40,550
All right.

2193
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:41,530
I'm back.

2194
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:42,430
I'm back, everybody.

2195
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:43,890
Um...

2196
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:44,630
Oh, my gosh.

2197
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:44,650
I'm back.

2198
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:44,870
Oh, my gosh.

2199
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:45,750
Okay.

2200
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:46,470
So, yeah.

2201
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:47,470
So, that was...

2202
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:48,730
I can't believe you guys...

2203
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:52,950
I can't believe you guys fucking broke into the Minecraft server.

2204
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:54,810
Like, what the fuck?

2205
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:58,470
Oh, my God.

2206
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:00,150
Um...

2207
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:00,530
All right.

2208
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:01,690
I actually wrote notes on like...

2209
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:02,570
Just to be like...

2210
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:02,790
Okay.

2211
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:04,470
Remember to talk about this.

2212
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,150
And then remember to talk about that.

2213
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:07,670
And then remember to talk about this.

2214
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:09,170
Um...

2215
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:10,230
Okay.

2216
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:10,730
Let me see.

2217
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:13,110
I'm looking through my notes just to be sure that...

2218
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:13,950
Uh...

2219
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:14,630
Just to be sure that I'm not gonna be like...

2220
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:17,130
Just to make sure that I got like majority of stuff that I want to talk about.

2221
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:18,010
Ah...

2222
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:19,430
Okay.

2223
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:21,610
Whoo!

2224
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:22,170
Okay.

2225
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:23,390
Um...

2226
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:25,070
I guess like...

2227
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:27,370
I can do my second gift.

2228
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:30,430
I guess it's time to give you guys the second gift.

2229
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:30,710
All right.

2230
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:32,050
I'm bringing the present back.

2231
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:32,990
All right.

2232
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:34,750
All right.

2233
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:35,410
So...

2234
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:40,230
This gift is unfinished, though.

2235
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:41,070
Um...

2236
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:41,890
It's not done yet.

2237
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:43,370
But I wanted to show you guys.

2238
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:44,510
Uh...

2239
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:46,230
The preview of it.

2240
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:47,430
Um...

2241
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:49,570
I'm gonna do like gift two and three.

2242
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:50,570
Uh...

2243
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:52,350
So it's like second gift and then the third gift.

2244
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:57,630
And then maybe by that time, I can make my final announcement.

2245
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:01,230
I don't know if I stalled enough.

2246
01:13:07,010 --> 01:13:07,970
But yes.

2247
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:11,050
Here is my second gift.

2248
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:12,350
Oh.

2249
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:13,350
This is the correct one.

2250
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:14,170
No.

2251
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:15,470
What did I move?

2252
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:17,150
What did I move?

2253
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:17,710
Oh.

2254
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:18,250
This is...

2255
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:18,790
What is that?

2256
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:20,650
What is that?

2257
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:20,810
Oh.

2258
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:21,310
That's the...

2259
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:21,470
Okay.

2260
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:22,030
That's something else.

2261
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:22,370
Okay.

2262
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:23,090
I was like...

2263
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:24,050
What was I moving?

2264
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:25,030
Wait.

2265
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:25,990
Where did it go?

2266
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:27,270
Wait.

2267
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:28,330
Sorry.

2268
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:29,370
I'm gonna mess a little bit.

2269
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:30,050
All right.

2270
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:31,810
Where the fuck did it go?

2271
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:33,190
Where did...

2272
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:33,390
Okay.

2273
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:34,110
I'm just gonna...

2274
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:35,550
I'm just gonna resize it.

2275
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:36,390
Sorry.

2276
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:37,070
I can't...

2277
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:38,590
The immersion stops here.

2278
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:40,070
Because I'm just gonna reset...

2279
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:40,930
Reset the transform.

2280
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:42,210
There it is.

2281
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:45,370
Yes!

2282
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:47,250
It is another one!

2283
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:48,330
Okay.

2284
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:49,590
So, some of you guys were like, what is that?

2285
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:50,810
This...

2286
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:51,410
Oh my gosh.

2287
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:52,310
The immersion.

2288
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:55,270
This...

2289
01:13:57,790 --> 01:13:58,910
Is an...

2290
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:04,670
This is an artwork drawn by my mama!

2291
01:14:05,050 --> 01:14:06,490
My mama drew this.

2292
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:10,050
I thought about whether or not...

2293
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,150
To make this as merch.

2294
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:12,190
But...

2295
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:17,410
Because I am already releasing like the birthday merch.

2296
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:18,850
Soon TM.

2297
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:22,970
I guess I wanted to paste stuff.

2298
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:28,590
I will be releasing this for free whenever it's done.

2299
01:14:29,730 --> 01:14:31,830
So, you guys can make it...

2300
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:32,850
Merch of it yourself.

2301
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:35,730
You don't have to like buy this as a merch.

2302
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:39,750
So, I will be releasing this.

2303
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:39,970
This...

2304
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:40,610
For free.

2305
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:41,810
Whenever it's done.

2306
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:44,170
Since I already...

2307
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:44,990
I mean you guys are gonna be...

2308
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:46,850
Since I already planned on releasing like...

2309
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:48,510
I don't want like two prints like...

2310
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:54,030
So...

2311
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:55,610
This...

2312
01:14:55,610 --> 01:15:05,770
Whenever my mama is done with this illustration, it will be free for all dragons to download in the future.

2313
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:07,330
It won't be like paywall or anything.

2314
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:09,610
I will be releasing this for free.

2315
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:12,430
Just because I already have like the birthday merch print and everything.

2316
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:16,990
I just didn't feel like I needed to really...

2317
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:19,290
Like you can make it merch as for yourself.

2318
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:20,010
Like I don't...

2319
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:23,070
Like I don't really mind.

2320
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:26,310
You guys are like...

2321
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:27,630
Yogi wanna pay you.

2322
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:29,610
That's what BattleBirds merch is for.

2323
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:30,390
We're like...

2324
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:34,270
We're like coming up with a huge line for BattleBirds.

2325
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:36,070
Like we're gonna make an art book and everything.

2326
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:38,730
Like a hardcover limited edition art book and stuff.

2327
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:42,250
We're gonna make it up with like text and like notes and everything from all the people that went...

2328
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:43,190
Like made it.

2329
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:46,850
And then we're gonna have like a special merch being made for BattleBirds.

2330
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:48,690
That's what BattleBirds is for.

2331
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:51,550
Like I don't wanna like spam you guys with merch.

2332
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:52,370
Cause like...

2333
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:52,970
Like...

2334
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:53,770
Like...

2335
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:55,410
You guys gotta look after your wallets.

2336
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:55,750
You know?

2337
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:56,330
You guys...

2338
01:15:59,370 --> 01:16:04,230
I want you guys to like you know have enough for rent and food and the internet.

2339
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:06,410
Cause like without the internet, how are you gonna watch me?

2340
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:08,350
Um...

2341
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:09,250
So that's why...

2342
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,210
And I know shipping is crazy expensive too.

2343
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:11,890
So like...

2344
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:14,630
That's why like I'm pacing my...

2345
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:16,050
My merch in general.

2346
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:17,090
Um...

2347
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:18,610
Just cause like you know...

2348
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:19,790
I don't really...

2349
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:20,890
Um...

2350
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:23,270
Like I know like merch is a lot of profit.

2351
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:24,430
But like...

2352
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:27,290
I'm not here for like insane profit.

2353
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:28,970
Like I'm just here to have a good time.

2354
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:36,950
Like I don't wanna fucking bleed you guys dry.

2355
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:38,070
Like what the f...

2356
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:49,070
Um...

2357
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:51,010
Just casually...

2358
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:51,130
What?

2359
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:53,610
We talked about the art book before!

2360
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:56,710
We talked about it during the behind the scenes!

2361
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:57,690
What do you mean?

2362
01:16:58,010 --> 01:16:59,790
I dropped a bombshell!

2363
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:07,410
Like we were talking about the fucking possibility of making an art book regarding the production behind.

2364
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:08,330
Um...

2365
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:09,630
Battlebirds.

2366
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:11,630
Like it's not like...

2367
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:12,530
I didn't confirm...

2368
01:17:12,530 --> 01:17:13,350
Okay it's confirmed.

2369
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:14,330
Um...

2370
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:14,930
We're like...

2371
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:15,990
I'm like scouting...

2372
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:16,550
Like we're...

2373
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:18,610
I'm like scouting out like a...

2374
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:19,610
Um...

2375
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:23,110
Like a person that can publish art books and stuff.

2376
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:23,750
Um...

2377
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:25,090
Like self-publish art books.

2378
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:26,110
Um...

2379
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:28,910
Cause there's just so many amazing artwork and uh...

2380
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:34,170
Work in progress and concept art that went into the production behind Battlebirds in general.

2381
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:35,150
Um...

2382
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:37,010
So that's why like...

2383
01:17:37,010 --> 01:17:37,670
Uh...

2384
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:37,790
That's why I'm like...

2385
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:37,830
I'm like...

2386
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:37,990
I'm like...

2387
01:17:37,990 --> 01:17:39,690
That's why like it's gonna take time.

2388
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:40,670
Um...

2389
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:43,870
To like have all that planned and when...

2390
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:45,570
Cause like I don't wanna like rush it as well.

2391
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:51,490
I want merch that is something that you guys really want and um...

2392
01:17:51,490 --> 01:17:53,250
There's quality going into it.

2393
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:54,330
I'm not wanna re...

2394
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:54,990
Like I'm...

2395
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:56,190
I don't...

2396
01:17:56,190 --> 01:18:01,850
I don't wanna reuse illustrations for like 500 different types of merch and stuff.

2397
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:07,370
I like having like unique illustration for like a unique certain merch line.

2398
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:09,210
So like um...

2399
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:14,690
Like this illustration will be for this merch and uh...

2400
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:18,290
This illustration will be for that merch.

2401
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:20,890
Cause I like to put like care and thought into it.

2402
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:24,530
I feel like I don't wanna reprint it for like various other things.

2403
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:25,610
Um...

2404
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:27,530
Because like that's not...

2405
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:29,350
As somebody that like collects stuff.

2406
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:31,330
Like as a consumer...

2407
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:33,370
I rather have quality...

2408
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:34,610
Uh...

2409
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:35,150
Over quantity.

2410
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:37,130
Just cause like I want...

2411
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:37,350
I want...

2412
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:39,050
The merch to have special meaning.

2413
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:39,750
Uh...

2414
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:45,030
Especially like when I'm putting thought into it.

2415
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:46,110
I like having...

2416
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:49,030
Cause as someone that used to sell at Artist Alley.

2417
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:50,130
Like I...

2418
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:50,850
Um...

2419
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:54,190
I like having special meaning when it comes to like what merch is.

2420
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:55,910
Speaking of like future merch.

2421
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:56,830

2422
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:57,750
I hope like...

2423
01:18:58,350 --> 01:18:58,590
Uh...

2424
01:18:58,590 --> 01:19:00,050

2425
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:00,710
Oh my gosh.

2426
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:02,430

Okay.

2431
01:19:10,650 --> 01:19:11,910
I don't know when this will be done.

2432
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:14,510
Because we're still designing the concept of it.

2433
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:15,570
But like...

2434
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:15,810

2615
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:09,440
And I was like, cause like he always wanted to host something for vtubers and um, this last this week.

2616
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,760
Um, we were talking about it.

2617
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,580
I was like, do you want to do it like for my next event?

2618
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:19,760
and um We are currently uh, I think we had a date established too.

2619
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:19,960
We were

2620
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:29,680
So Uh, this will be a spiritual successor of sorts.

2621
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,700
Uh, Uh, it's not gonna be a tournament.

2622
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:40,260
It is gonna be a custom and Uh, we are planning on oh my gosh Okay, give me a second.

2623
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:48,300
I need to pull up my tempo chat logs because he gave me dates and I was just like I just I already forgot there's so much stuff going on

2624
01:27:51,600 --> 01:28:25,320
It would either be on Uh, september 28th or uh october 5th um We've established like dates for it And i'm announcing it now And i'm announcing it now We're getting interest right now because um Participants will be invite It'll be invited participants as in we'll be inviting like I guess like quote unquote team captains But it's a custom.

2625
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:27,520
So if you guys don't know it's not gonna be tournament.

2626
01:28:27,740 --> 01:29:07,420
It's not gonna be screaming Um, it's gonna be like fun match serious match fun match serious match fun match and the prizes won't be like currency It won't be money But the prize pool Will equal a lot of money as in like the prizes will because like maybe like one of the fun matches like oh and like The maybe we'll have like one will be like hide and seek match and like the team that The team that hides the best like the team that survives in the end will win a pc like each person gets a pc or like a 40 80 stuff like that like or like an exclusive like apex legends like merch or

2627
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,980
We are in talks at the moment.

2628
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:31,680
Obviously, the bigger interest this event will get, this custom will get, the bigger sponsors we can have to provide better prizes.

2629
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:38,060
Each game will have its own trophy and its own prize.

2630
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:49,460
So like each game, everybody type and then every participant will receive like a little memorabilia similar to WrestleTuber.

2631
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:56,920
I talked to Tempo and we were like, should we gather interest privately or publicly?

2632
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:01,660
I decided to make it public that plans are public.

2633
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:09,460
So we are in motion because the prizes gets more...

2634
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:15,800
I guess the prize pool and budget and sponsors are more lucrative the higher interest we get.

2635
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:21,400
And the more interest we get from VTubers.

2636
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:29,240
This custom will be open to NA and APAC VTubers.

2637
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:31,060
It will only be VTubers.

2638
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:41,100
And it has to be like full on like VTubing type deal.

2639
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:42,940
So I'm sorry EU.

2640
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:44,120
I'm really sorry EU.

2641
01:30:50,860 --> 01:31:00,400
I'm really sorry EU but we had to make a decision on NA EU or NA APAC.

2642
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:07,360
Due to servers issue.

2643
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:16,840
So we decided to make it NA.

2644
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,880
We had to make a very tough decision.

2645
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:27,100
Regarding like the VTubers that will be participating.

2646
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,500
It's not V-Cycle.

2647
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:31,480
It's a 4 fun...

2648
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,700
It's a 4 fun custom.

2649
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:36,960
And similar to like it's just for fun.

2650
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:40,520
We're gonna have more fun matches than serious matches.

2651
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,320
Because we have so many customs.

2652
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:43,440
We have so many tournaments.

2653
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:45,960
That's like super serious and everything.

2654
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,980
And I told Tempo.

2655
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:52,800
I was like I don't want like prize money for this.

2656
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:54,760
Like I don't want people to win prize money.

2657
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:56,380
I want like prizes.

2658
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:59,160
Because I feel like when you do prizes.

2659
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:02,300
When you do prizes.

2660
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:07,000
People tend to make it more fun in general.

2661
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:11,900
And not take it as serious as like money.

2662
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:19,440
So that's why some of them will be like you know more like fun prizes.

2663
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:22,280
Like maybe plushies or like Apex plushies.

2664
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:24,560
Or like maybe one of them will be like a computer.

2665
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:27,620
The serious one will be a computer.

2666
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:31,820
But each team that wins like a game in this custom.

2667
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:34,640
Will receive like a little like medal or a trophy.

2668
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:34,980
It depends.

2669
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:37,360
I'm like still working all the details out at the moment.

2670
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:41,680
Like I said like this is still like in the works.

2671
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:43,540
So now we're just getting interest.

2672
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,500
We're garnering interest.

2673
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:49,820
To see like who wants to like to see like participant who might be interested in it.

2674
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:54,760
Because I'll be like.

2675
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:57,480
I'll be inviting people.

2676
01:32:57,820 --> 01:33:01,180
To see gather interest by inviting Vtubers.

2677
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:04,080
And like I don't want to make it full on centric.

2678
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,880
Like Apex Vtubers only can join.

2679
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:13,980
This is why I'm focusing heavily on the fun aspect of it.

2680
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:20,100
Because I wanted so that the fun aspect.

2681
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:23,460
So I'm opening invites to people who don't normally stream Apex.

2682
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:24,740
Or are not very great at it.

2683
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:30,120
But FPS just for the sake that you know people tend to not play FPS.

2684
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,040
Might really enjoy the melee.

2685
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:33,320
You know the melee only.

2686
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:36,320
Or like only melees and stuff like that.

2687
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:40,720
And yeah.

2688
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,960
So that is my next event.

2689
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,140
I don't know what to call it yet.

2690
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:49,740
Like I said like Temple and I were literally talking about this.

2691
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:50,560
This week.

2692
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:54,480
And I decided to use my birthday to announce them.

2693
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,220
My next event.

2694
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:57,020
Just like in the past.

2695
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:04,000
I want to use my birthday to announce the next event that is in the works at the moment.

2696
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:12,600
I think you guys know like Shibuya Hau is definitely like one of my role models.

2697
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,580
As well as Amelia Watson.

2698
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:19,060
Shibuya Hau for his amazing like organization skills.

2699
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:22,820
When it comes to like tournaments like the Shibuya Hau customs and everything.

2700
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:24,460
He has a lot of fun.

2701
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:30,140
And he has been like a great role model and inspiration to me when it comes to organizing tournaments and events.

2702
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:33,120
The fact that he is able to do that and like make a...

2703
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:34,460
Um...

2704
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:36,500
Make a...

2705
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:41,120
I guess like image and like presence for himself.

2706
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:43,860
Regarding FPS games in general.

2707
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:49,740
And being able to organize like all these events regarding FPS stuff.

2708
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,920
And having a team behind it.

2709
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:55,000
And like his like V-Psycho stuff is so famous in Japan.

2710
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,620
To the point that like when I was in Japan.

2711
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:03,960
I would see like V-Psycho merch being sold with like regular Apex merch.

2712
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,020
Like in a mall.

2713
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:10,000
I felt like at that point like that's like crazy to think about.

2714
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:11,040
Um...

2715
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:11,820
How...

2716
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:13,960
Like how Shibuya Hau is like...

2717
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:16,480
How it made such an impact when it comes to...

2718
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,460
Um...

2719
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:19,400
When it comes to like Apex and stuff.

2720
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:21,020
Um...

2721
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:23,280
And like just like events as well.

2722
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:24,200
Like CR Raccoon.

2723
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:25,080
Like CR...

2724
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,380
You can say like oh there's like crazy raccoon events.

2725
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:30,680
That's like organized by like an entire company.

2726
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,140
And Shibuya Hau is like a person.

2727
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:35,440
Like a singular...

2728
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,380
Like you know you say crazy raccoon tournaments in Japan.

2729
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:40,640
And crazy raccoon tournaments...

2730
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:42,420
The whole image behind it is like...

2731
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:43,180
Uh...

2732
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:43,960
The org itself.

2733
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:45,660
But like...

2734
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:46,460
Um...

2735
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:49,020
I think like Shibuya Hau has...

2736
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:50,920
Does have teams behind him.

2737
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:52,500
But he does do a lot of work.

2738
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:53,080
Uh...

2739
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,260
Behind the tournaments as well.

2740
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:56,620
Like he started organizing these tournaments himself.

2741
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:58,560
To a point that it grew so big in Japan.

2742
01:35:58,980 --> 01:36:02,480
That like his merch is sold in like...

2743
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:05,240
His merch is sold in like malls and stuff.

2744
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,020
Like um...

2745
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:10,960
And you can see it being placed right next to like regular Apex stuff.

2746
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:14,920
And like other like famous like anime merch and everything.

2747
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:20,780
And so he's like an incredible inspiration to me when it comes to like organizing FPS tournaments and everything.

2748
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:24,140
Like I got a lot of inspiration from the stuff he's done in the past.

2749
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:25,320
As well as like...

2750
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:26,040
For Ami...

2751
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:27,200
Um...

2752
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:30,120
I talked about this a lot in the past.

2753
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:30,900
So it's not like...

2754
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:31,160
Oh...

2755
01:36:31,540 --> 01:36:33,140
She's mentioning Ami for the first time.

2756
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:33,480
No...

2757
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:34,940
I've talked about it a lot.

2758
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:43,040
Um...

2759
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:44,240
Um...

2760
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,520
But yeah like...

2761
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:46,840
Um...

2762
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:47,340
Uh...

2763
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:49,920
I feel like she's really great at organizing things.

2764
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,860
And like...

2765
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:55,640
Was such a pioneer when it came to like what a singular VTuber can do.

2766
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:57,620
And like in terms of like hosting events.

2767
01:36:57,820 --> 01:36:58,880
And hosting like...

2768
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,460
Uh...

2769
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:00,380
Projects and everything.

2770
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:01,300
Um...

2771
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:03,260
I feel like I wouldn't have been able to...

2772
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:04,100
Uh...

2773
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:07,040
Organize the things I've organized without like...

2774
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:07,760
Um...

2775
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:11,220
The fact that Ami inspired me a lot to do these types of things.

2776
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:11,960
Uh...

2777
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:13,380
To see her motivation drive...

2778
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:14,080
Uh...

2779
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:15,940
When she started and like...

2780
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:18,220
Pioneered a lot of stuff within the VTubing community.

2781
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:19,500
Um...

2782
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,060
So I wouldn't have been able to do all of this without like...

2783
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:22,560
Uh...

2784
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:23,860
Her taking the first steps.

2785
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:24,880
Um...

2786
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:27,940
First steps in starting these big projects herself.

2787
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:29,500
Um...

2788
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:31,100
So...

2789
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:31,620
Yeah...

2790
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:32,460
And...

2791
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:33,380
Um...

2792
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:34,720
Also like I know it's hard like...

2793
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,560
Crazy Raccoon has also done so much too.

2794
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,580
Regarding organization and stuff.

2795
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:39,300
And...

2796
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:40,100
Um...

2797
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:41,120
They've like...

2798
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,500
Um...

2799
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:43,060
They're really great at organizing tournaments.

2800
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:47,500
And I really wish that we do have more of these types of things in the VTubing community.

2801
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:48,940
Um...

2802
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:49,620
And...

2803
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:50,320
Um...

2804
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:51,000
I'm really...

2805
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,460
I hope that like...

2806
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:53,040
You know...

2807
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:53,420
Uh...

2808
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:54,780
This Apex Custom...

2809
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:55,500
Will go well!

2810
01:37:58,970 --> 01:38:00,130
I hope...

2811
01:38:00,130 --> 01:38:02,270
I do hope this Apex Custom...

2812
01:38:02,270 --> 01:38:03,190
Will go well.

2813
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:03,850
Um...

2814
01:38:03,850 --> 01:38:04,530
We're still...

2815
01:38:04,530 --> 01:38:05,270
We're still like...

2816
01:38:05,270 --> 01:38:06,410
Drafting it up.

2817
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:07,670
And everything...

2818
01:38:07,670 --> 01:38:08,970
Like I said like...

2819
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:09,690
Uh...

2820
01:38:09,690 --> 01:38:11,030
Tempo was telling me like...

2821
01:38:11,030 --> 01:38:11,770
We need to...

2822
01:38:11,770 --> 01:38:12,590
Gather interest.

2823
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:15,010
And see who's actually willing to commit to it.

2824
01:38:15,190 --> 01:38:15,790
Um...

2825
01:38:15,790 --> 01:38:16,130
To...

2826
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:16,910
To...

2827
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:17,410
To...

2828
01:38:17,410 --> 01:38:19,170
Approach sponsors and everything.

2829
01:38:19,690 --> 01:38:20,170
Um...

2830
01:38:20,170 --> 01:38:21,610
To be able to approach sponsors.

2831
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:23,670
And like get like the definite prize pool.

2832
01:38:23,890 --> 01:38:24,650
Of everything.

2833
01:38:24,990 --> 01:38:25,470
So...

2834
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:25,710
Yeah!

2835
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:27,390
Yeah!

2836
01:38:28,130 --> 01:38:28,610
Um...

2837
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:29,210
Alright!

2838
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:31,390
Let me look at what my staff said.

2839
01:38:31,810 --> 01:38:32,730
If I can.

2840
01:38:34,190 --> 01:38:34,670
Uh...

2841
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:35,470
Okay.

2842
01:38:35,590 --> 01:38:35,890
So...

2843
01:38:35,890 --> 01:38:36,630
We're still starting.

2844
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:37,290
Alright.

2845
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:37,890
Before...

2846
01:38:37,890 --> 01:38:38,130
Okay.

2847
01:38:38,170 --> 01:38:39,230
I'm gonna start one more time.

2848
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:39,950
One last time.

2849
01:38:40,330 --> 01:38:40,810
Uh...

2850
01:38:40,810 --> 01:38:41,590
New goals.

2851
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:42,810
There's something I wanted to do.

2852
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:45,830
So...

2853
01:38:45,830 --> 01:38:49,050
I'm gonna start...

2854
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:49,490
So...

2855
01:38:50,050 --> 01:38:51,110
This is what I wanted to do.

2856
01:38:51,110 --> 01:38:51,230
Oh...

2857
01:38:51,230 --> 01:38:52,910
The final song.

2858
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:55,290
If it's not ready...

2859
01:38:55,570 --> 01:38:58,850
I will announce this last thing another time.

2860
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:04,590
And by the time I made the...

2861
01:39:04,590 --> 01:39:05,870
The goals list...

2862
01:39:05,870 --> 01:39:06,410
And...

2863
01:39:06,410 --> 01:39:08,070
And it's not ready...

2864
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:11,050
I will announce the last thing another time.

2865
01:39:16,530 --> 01:39:17,210
Okay.

2866
01:39:17,530 --> 01:39:18,070
Alright.

2867
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:18,270
Okay.

2868
01:39:19,190 --> 01:39:20,070
No, there's more.

2869
01:39:20,090 --> 01:39:21,130
There's one last announcement.

2870
01:39:21,410 --> 01:39:21,990
There's one...

2871
01:39:23,530 --> 01:39:25,170
There's one last announcement.

2872
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:29,710
Okay.

2873
01:39:33,110 --> 01:39:33,750
All right.

2874
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:34,530
New goals.

2875
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:57,390
This is why I told you guys, I don't want to make a new goals list until, until like a lot of these things got announced because, uh, because then I would spoil the goals that I've accomplished behind the scenes.

2876
01:39:57,750 --> 01:40:07,690
I was like, cause I was like, you know, my previous goals, it was like, Ooh, I want, uh, no, the Apex custom was not a star.

2877
01:40:07,870 --> 01:40:15,670
It was a gift, a gift to spoil you guys what the next event was going to be, what my next big event was going to be.

2878
01:40:15,690 --> 01:40:29,690
So like, we're not going to have like event announcement, like what they've so like by the time, by the time we're at a stage where we're like the, the event announcement for this apex custom, it's not going to be like secret.

2879
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:36,130
We'll have like a full on like logo and everything ready in like a stream to announce teams and everything.

2880
01:40:40,890 --> 01:41:01,290
Anyway, like I said, um, um, I didn't want to do the goals list until, uh, on my birthday, because in previous goals list, I wrote, I want to figure, well, I want to figure I want to nendoroid.

2881
01:41:01,410 --> 01:41:06,330
Well, it would be awkward if I didn't put that again, um, before the nendoroid announcement.

2882
01:41:06,530 --> 01:41:09,930
So I waited until majority announcements were made.

2883
01:41:11,030 --> 01:41:11,550
So we can have that.

2884
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:18,770
So we can have an actual real goals list.

2885
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:26,740
Um, oh, fuck.

2886
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:31,360
I just remembered there was another goal in there that we accomplished that hasn't been announced.

2887
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:34,940
That's which one is it?

2888
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:37,520
Okay.

2889
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:38,460
JK.

2890
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:44,140
There's actually like one more goal in there that, uh, JK.

2891
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:54,080
That we accomplished behind the scenes, but I can't say because now, now it's time for you guys to figure it out.

2892
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:01,860
Now it's your turn to figure it out.

2893
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:02,800
What it could be.

2894
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:06,520
Also, I'm going to tell them my staff that like, I'm going to stop for 30 more minutes.

2895
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:10,020
If in 30 minutes.

2896
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:12,180
Okay.

2897
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:14,040
Okay.

2898
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:16,160
I had a very long day today.

2899
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:20,020
I started my day at 8 AM.

2900
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:29,080
I'll stop for 30 more, more minutes.

2901
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:29,940
Okay.

2902
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:31,680
30 more minutes.

2903
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:35,180
And then I end stream.

2904
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:38,840
Okay.

2905
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:40,200
All right.

2906
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:41,680
Okay.

2907
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:42,780
So.

2908
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:45,920
This is definitely one that we all know that really want to do.

2909
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:48,040
Um, let's see.

2910
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:48,820
We okay.

2911
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:49,380
Shit.

2912
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:49,680
Okay.

2913
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:50,400
Give me a sec guys.

2914
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:57,500
I'm going to, I'm going to disappear real quick on screen because like, I'm going to type like numbers and then you're going to see like a million toggles go on.

2915
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:01,760
So I'm going to disappear for like one second.

2916
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,640
Don't be like, where did Doki go?

2917
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:07,900
Give me a sec guys.

2918
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:08,400
Okay.

2919
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:09,080
There you go.

2920
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:09,980
Okay.

2921
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:10,760
Okay.

2922
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:13,140
I guess gotta make sure I just gotta make sure.

2923
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:13,840
All right.

2924
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:15,520
Uh, poof.

2925
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:15,920
I'm back.

2926
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:16,620
All right.

2927
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:17,580
This one.

2928
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,420
1 million subscribers.

2929
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:23,880
I, I'm tired.

2930
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:25,260
I can't even spell right now.

2931
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:29,980
Before end of 2024.

2932
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:32,220
Actually, I don't even know if that's possible anymore.

2933
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:35,600
I don't, I don't know.

2934
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:36,840
It's actually a little scary.

2935
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:38,640
Cause like, I don't know.

2936
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:40,740
It's so, it'll suck if we don't hit it.

2937
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:42,680
It would actually really suck.

2938
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:46,060
Cause people like, well, failed goal.

2939
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:53,400
So, um, I'm scared.

2940
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:53,960
I'm worried.

2941
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:59,480
Should I like before end of January at 2025.

2942
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:08,740
Okay.

2943
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:09,520
Okay.

2944
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:09,960
Here we go.

2945
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:11,800
I gave us a little bit of leeway.

2946
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:15,680
Just, just a little bit of leeway here.

2947
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:21,240
So 1 million before end of January 2025.

2948
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:25,020
Um, don't sit.

2949
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:25,300
Fine.

2950
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:26,240
Fine.

2951
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:26,700
Okay.

2952
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:28,520
Before end of 2025.

2953
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:29,120
Fine.

2954
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:29,580
Fine.

2955
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:31,880
If you guys were so, you guys are so confident.

2956
01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:36,740
All right.

2957
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:40,160
1 million subscribers before end of 2024.

2958
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:41,620
That is awesome.

2959
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:41,780
That is awesome.

2960
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:42,400
Okay.

2961
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:46,280
So my new goal, um, another goal.

2962
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:54,900
I would love to have a Funko pop Funko pop.

2963
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,600
Do you hear that guys?

2964
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:57,520
Funko pop.

2965
01:44:57,780 --> 01:45:01,520
I'll be your first VTuber, your first VTuber Funko.

2966
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:02,480
I'm marketable.

2967
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:03,380
I think.

2968
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:05,400
I mean, I'm having an Android.

2969
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:06,380
I should be marketable now.

2970
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:11,780
I need to complete the tribal.

2971
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:12,080
Triangle!

2972
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:14,760
I have the YouTube's figure!

2973
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:16,800
I have the Nendoroid!

2974
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:19,180
I need to complete the triangle!

2975
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:20,880
I'm missing...

2976
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:25,260
I'm missing the Funko Pop!

2977
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:30,420
We need a summoning... like how am I supposed to complete the summoning circle without the Funko Pop?

2978
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:35,760
We have the normie audience!

2979
01:45:36,180 --> 01:46:01,340
We have the flesh... we need... okay, we have the flesh too because YouTube's there's a lot of like the the YouTube the YouTuber sometimes like flesh tuber audience the youtuber slash flesh tuber audience We have the otaku slash anime audience and now we need the normie audience We need the Funko Pop This is how you summon Doki

2980
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:17,420
We're nearly we're nearly missing the Funko Pop Anyway, uh, but yes, that is one of the two goals that I really do wanna, uh...

2981
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:18,460
I feel like... No!

2982
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:22,500
It would not ruin... It would not ruin the magic circle.

2983
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:28,140
Because if we get a deal with Funko Pop, then I'll have, like, so many versions of me.

2984
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:34,620
Like, we'll have enough Funkos to make an entire circle.

2985
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:38,380
We're gonna have a flocked version of Doki.

2986
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:42,740
We're gonna have the, like, one foot tall Funko Doki.

2987
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:45,160
We're gonna have the metallic Doki.

2988
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:47,400
We're gonna have the, uh...

2989
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:51,980
We're gonna have the feminized Doki Bird.

2990
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:54,300
We're gonna have the, uh...

2991
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:55,800
We're gonna have...

2992
01:46:58,540 --> 01:47:00,600
We're gonna have so many...

2993
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:05,420
Guys, the moment we get that Funko deal, we will have so many alternate versions of Doki.

2994
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:07,860
We're gonna have the glow-in-the-dark Doki.

2995
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:11,220
We're gonna make the entire circle with Funko Pop.

2996
01:47:13,580 --> 01:47:15,080
Think about it, guys.

2997
01:47:15,460 --> 01:47:16,520
And then the normie...

2998
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:21,340
Look, guys, the normie audience is gonna be like, we have to collect all the Dokis.

2999
01:47:21,700 --> 01:47:22,400
Okay, guys?

3000
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:25,760
This is how...

3001
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,040
Doki, I thought you said you're not for profit.

3002
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:31,960
This is, like, such a capitalistic thing to do.

3003
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:32,680
Okay, look.

3004
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:33,920
I make exceptions.

3005
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:35,520
And that is for Funko Pop.

3006
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:43,440
My one exception is for Funko Pop.

3007
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:48,180
Because I want all the different alternatives when it comes to Funko.

3008
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:52,400
Alright.

3009
01:47:54,980 --> 01:47:55,340
Anyway.

3010
01:47:56,180 --> 01:47:56,860
Other goals.

3011
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:58,360
Oh my gosh, where did my goals list go?

3012
01:47:58,720 --> 01:47:59,260
Oh no.

3013
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:00,020
Oh, there it is.

3014
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:00,980
Okay, I think this is it.

3015
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:01,920
Yeah, no, that's not it.

3016
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:02,240
Oh no.

3017
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,060
Where did my goals list go?

3018
01:48:04,180 --> 01:48:05,180
Oh, here it is.

3019
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:05,520
Okay.

3020
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:06,240
Anyway.

3021
01:48:06,940 --> 01:48:07,660
That's, like...

3022
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:11,860
And then we get featured in the Funko Pop game alongside Funko Freddy Fazbear!

3023
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:12,620
Exactly!

3024
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,240
Exactly!

3025
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:16,940
That, that, that...

3026
01:48:16,940 --> 01:48:18,400
You know how capitalism works.

3027
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:22,240
Alright.

3028
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:23,040
Another goal.

3029
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:29,220
Get a pro player to use my merch...

3030
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:32,180
To use my gaming...

3031
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:34,880
Gamer gear on...

3032
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,740
In a tournament.

3033
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:38,480
Alright.

3034
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:42,680
Guys, please somebody get good so you can bring Doki merch to a tournament.

3035
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:47,500
That's all I want.

3036
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:48,060
Alright.

3037
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:49,780
Okay.

3038
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:51,100
Uh...

3039
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:52,980
That's one of my goals.

3040
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:54,240
Another goal that I have.

3041
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:55,480
Um...

3042
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:56,880
Okay, this is a very personal goal.

3043
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:58,460
I wanna...

3044
01:48:58,460 --> 01:48:59,460
This is something I really...

3045
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:01,960
Cause like, I feel like I really want to motivate myself.

3046
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:05,320
You know, like I've strayed away from like, um...

3047
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,540
I've been more variety.

3048
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,140
Um, as of late.

3049
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:09,220
But like...

3050
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:10,380
I feel like...

3051
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:12,160
I wanna get back into like...

3052
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:13,220
Being competitive.

3053
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:14,360
In a way.

3054
01:49:14,820 --> 01:49:16,320
Not more so like...

3055
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:17,580
More so like...

3056
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:20,120
I wanna get back into leaderboard grinding.

3057
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:21,360
Um...

3058
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,740
But like not like forcing it on stream type deal.

3059
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:24,860
Um...

3060
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:25,360
I won't like...

3061
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:29,160
You know, I won't be like stream spamming rank all the time type deal.

3062
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:31,200
But it's more so like...

3063
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:32,700
A little personal goal for myself.

3064
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:34,200
Um...

3065
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:36,100
I won't be spamming the streams for these.

3066
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:38,120
But like when I get close to it...

3067
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:39,700
Maybe I'll like stream the climb.

3068
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:41,680
The like last remaining climb to it.

3069
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:42,840
Um...

3070
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:44,480
But...

3071
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:45,340
I...

3072
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:46,640
Um...

3073
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:48,060
In...

3074
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:48,760
Um...

3075
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:50,140
This is...

3076
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:51,560
This is a goal I've been thinking about a lot.

3077
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:52,660
In...

3078
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:53,720
Uh...

3079
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:54,440

Oh wait.

3082
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:56,760
Within...

3083
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:58,080
A year...

3084
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,760
I want to get...

3085
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,220
On the leaderboards...

3086
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:05,180
For 4 different games.

3087
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:07,120
Um...

3088
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:08,120
So...

3089
01:50:08,120 --> 01:50:09,320
This is a little...

3090
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:10,700
Personal goal of mine.

3091
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:12,120
Uh...

3092
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:13,600
I want to be...

3093
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:15,200
Uh...

3094
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:15,800
Any...

3095
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:17,720
For any competitive game...

3096
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:20,140
I want to...

3097
01:50:20,140 --> 01:50:23,500
Be on a leaderboards for 4 different games.

3098
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:24,520
It doesn't...

3099
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:25,740
They don't have to be on the same season.

3100
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:26,840
That's crazy.

3101
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:28,360
Hahaha...

3102
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:32,480
But...

3103
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:35,360
I want to do this in 4 different games.

3104
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:36,980
Uh...

3105
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:37,960
Within a year.

3106
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:38,500
So...

3107
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:39,500
Within a year...

3108
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:39,860
Uh...

3109
01:50:39,860 --> 01:50:40,560
July...

3110
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:41,160
So...

3111
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:41,680
On my...

3112
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:43,460
On next year's birthday...

3113
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:45,040
On next year's birthday...

3114
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:46,480
I would have accomplished...

3115
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:47,540
4...

3116
01:50:47,540 --> 01:50:48,580
4 games...

3117
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:50,060
4 different games...

3118
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:51,200
Being on the leaderboards.

3119
01:50:51,820 --> 01:50:52,380
And...

3120
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:53,340
And not the leaderboards.

3121
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:54,180
So I don't want to touch it.

3122
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:55,620
I want to end on the leaderboards.

3123
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:57,120
And this is a little personal...

3124
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:57,440
Oh...

3125
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:57,840
Hey...

3126
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:58,880
Hey dad...

3127
01:50:58,880 --> 01:50:59,540
The fuck?

3128
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:00,000
Okay...

3129
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,560
I just felt like his nose touched my leg.

3130
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:02,000
And I was like...

3131
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:02,360
Oh...

3132
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:03,660
You know like cold...

3133
01:51:03,660 --> 01:51:04,620
Cold noses.

3134
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:05,840
Why are you here?

3135
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:07,120
Hahaha...

3136
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:08,560
Hahaha...

3137
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:09,700
Hahaha...

3138
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:10,360
Hahaha...

3139
01:51:10,980 --> 01:51:11,000
Hahaha...

3140
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,260
So...

3141
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:13,240
Um...

3142
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:14,380
That's something I want to do.

3143
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:15,700
So within a year.

3144
01:51:15,980 --> 01:51:16,620
Okay...

3145
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:17,500
Let me...

3146
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:18,560
Bop bop bop...

3147
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:19,920
Uh...

3148
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:22,260
July 2025.

3149
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:24,500
I feel like this is so doable.

3150
01:51:24,820 --> 01:51:26,760
This is definitely really doable.

3151
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:27,820
Hahaha...

3152
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:32,720
And this is like a personal goal of mine.

3153
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:33,740
That I...

3154
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:34,380
Do you want...

3155
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:34,580
What?

3156
01:51:34,820 --> 01:51:35,340
Do you want to play this?

3157
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:37,280
What do you want?

3158
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:37,340
What do you want?

3159
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:37,920
I have no food.

3160
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:39,700
What do you...

3161
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:42,280
What do you want?

3162
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:43,600
I have no food.

3163
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:44,940
What do you want, dad?

3164
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:47,700
He's being needy.

3165
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:48,660
I don't know where he gets it from.

3166
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:55,000
She's that confident?

3167
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:56,080
Okay!

3168
01:51:56,660 --> 01:51:58,920
Okay, I'm sorry, but like...

3169
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:03,420
Guys, top 500 for Overwatch was Masters...

3170
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:05,920
Two.

3171
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:12,960
Guys, that's one game I've already fucking...

3172
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,520
Can get it.

3173
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:17,320
Last season's...

3174
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:18,740
Last season's...

3175
01:52:19,860 --> 01:52:23,260
Last season's top 500 for Overwatch was my...

3176
01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:25,920
I fucking can knock that off the park.

3177
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:32,020
Because no one... Look, I said four different games.

3178
01:52:32,340 --> 01:52:34,260
I did say... That's why I said four.

3179
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:35,320
I said...

3180
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:37,220
That's why... That's why I said four.

3181
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,240
So that's why...

3182
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:45,240
That's why, like... I feel like...

3183
01:52:45,940 --> 01:52:47,460
I feel like I can accomplish it.

3184
01:52:47,620 --> 01:52:49,400
I feel like I can accomplish it.

3185
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,940
And I feel like this is also a personal goal for myself.

3186
01:52:52,620 --> 01:52:54,080
Just to get back into the swing of things.

3187
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:57,300
Because I haven't been able to get much into competitive gaming.

3188
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,340
Dad, I'm having a stream!

3189
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:03,280
I don't... Okay.

3190
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:05,340
Guys, this is a little TMI.

3191
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:06,480
But...

3192
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,180
Okay, guys.

3193
01:53:11,340 --> 01:53:14,060
Okay, here's a little TMI about Dad.

3194
01:53:15,740 --> 01:53:16,960
He likes feet.

3195
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:19,560
Um... What do you mean by that?

3196
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:22,280
Well, the reason why he's...

3197
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:25,480
The reason why he's barking...

3198
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:26,640
Is that...

3199
01:53:28,540 --> 01:53:29,640
Is that...

3200
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:31,400
He wanted me to...

3201
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:33,420
To extend my leg.

3202
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:34,560
And like pet him.

3203
01:53:34,660 --> 01:53:36,080
With my... With my foot.

3204
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:42,660
So you can tell.

3205
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:44,020
He stopped barking, right?

3206
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:53,340
Okay, so this is...

3207
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:54,600
I am king shaming him.

3208
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:55,280
I am.

3209
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:55,860
I am.

3210
01:53:58,520 --> 01:53:59,020
Okay.

3211
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:00,120
Alright.

3212
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:01,060
Anyway.

3213
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:03,100
But he stopped barking.

3214
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:03,940
So...

3215
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:07,200
These are the sacrifices we have to make, guys.

3216
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:08,180
This is the sacrifice...

3217
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:10,040
This is the...

3218
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:12,500
This is the sacrifices we have to make.

3219
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:13,600
Oh my God, Dad.

3220
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:14,200
Are you serious?

3221
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:15,080
Are you...

3222
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:17,160
Are you fucking serious?

3223
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:20,340
Alright.

3224
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:22,060
Look, I stopped petting him.

3225
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:23,600
I stopped scratching him.

3226
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:24,820
So...

3227
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:26,320
We'll see what happens after...

3228
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:27,940
Let's see what happens.

3229
01:54:28,940 --> 01:54:29,460
Um...

3230
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:30,560
What was I gonna say?

3231
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:31,340
What was I gonna say?

3232
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:32,280
Okay, so...

3233
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:33,800
Other than that...

3234
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:35,860
Don't really have...

3235
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:37,420
Any other goals.

3236
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:38,560
I don't know.

3237
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:40,220
I don't know any goals to...

3238
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:41,380
Oh, he left.

3239
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:43,420
Okay.

3240
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:45,520
Okay.

3241
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:47,940
We're not gonna analyze that.

3242
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:54,540
He left.

3243
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:55,000
Okay.

3244
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:55,900
He left.

3245
01:54:56,260 --> 01:54:56,720
Okay.

3246
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:56,760
He left.

3247
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:57,460
Okay.

3248
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:00,660
He left.

3249
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:01,760
Okay.

3250
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:02,060
Um...

3251
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:02,740
Um...

3252
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:05,080
He got what he wanted.

3253
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:05,660
Okay.

3254
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:07,680
Um...

3255
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,100
I don't know.

3256
01:55:10,180 --> 01:55:12,360
I don't know what other goals to aim for.

3257
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:13,840
Other than...

3258
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:15,140
Um...

3259
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:17,700
Other than, like...

3260
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:18,960
Um...

3261
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:20,140
Other than that.

3262
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:21,640
Because it's like...

3263
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:23,900
There's...

3264
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:25,660
We already accomplished so much.

3265
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:28,320
And...

3266
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:31,540
We already accomplished so much together.

3267
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:32,720
Dragoons.

3268
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:33,600
That...

3269
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:39,800
It's so hard to think of new things to do.

3270
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:41,880
New things to aim for.

3271
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,180
That's why I had...

3272
01:55:43,180 --> 01:55:44,280
I had...

3273
01:55:45,260 --> 01:55:48,360
That's why I had this personal goal of mine.

3274
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:49,020
To have.

3275
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,180
Cause it's my own personal goal of mine.

3276
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:52,960
As a competitive gamer.

3277
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:54,840
Because like...

3278
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:57,100
Obviously there's so much stuff going on.

3279
01:55:57,940 --> 01:55:58,980
Behind the scenes.

3280
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,900
There's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes.

3281
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,200
That like I wasn't able to be...

3282
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,680
Like game...

3283
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:06,560
In a more competitive sense in a while.

3284
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:09,060
Like I haven't been able to play a lot of...

3285
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:11,360
FPS games or play competitive games.

3286
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:12,260
Off stream a lot.

3287
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:14,920
Because there's just so many things going on for me.

3288
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:17,100
But I hope things...

3289
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:19,440
Start to cool down by mid July.

3290
01:56:20,780 --> 01:56:22,000
That I can go back.

3291
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:24,140
To my roots.

3292
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:25,380
And...

3293
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:28,460
And like you know...

3294
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:29,980
I want to have my name.

3295
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:31,920
I want to have Doki Bird.

3296
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:33,820
And no other name.

3297
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:34,480
I want Doki...

3298
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:37,940
I want...

3299
01:56:37,940 --> 01:56:40,520
I want Doki Bird to be like...

3300
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:41,260
On the leaderboards.

3301
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:42,680
That's that Vtuber.

3302
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,680
That's that Vtuber on the leaderboards.

3303
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:46,320
Right there in this game.

3304
01:56:48,020 --> 01:56:49,340
That got there.

3305
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:51,020
And I want to do it on stream too.

3306
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:53,380
On stream.

3307
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:55,120
And show you guys.

3308
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:55,600
Look!

3309
01:56:56,120 --> 01:56:57,120
There she is!

3310
01:56:57,320 --> 01:56:57,840
On stream!

3311
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:00,380
Getting that...

3312
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:02,260
Staying in that leaderboard!

3313
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:04,200
Hahahaha!

3314
01:57:05,780 --> 01:57:06,420
Hahahaha!

3315
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:08,760
Um...

3316
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:10,680
So...

3317
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:12,540
That's something I really want to do.

3318
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:14,180
Um...

3319
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:15,780
I guess like...

3320
01:57:15,780 --> 01:57:19,060
I want to get that in for like...

3321
01:57:19,820 --> 01:57:20,460
Um...

3322
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:22,760
For like a personal goal of mine.

3323
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:23,100
Oh!

3324
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:23,680
There's one!

3325
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:24,780
There's another personal goal.

3326
01:57:24,940 --> 01:57:27,100
Win some form of Vtuber award.

3327
01:57:27,980 --> 01:57:28,660
Hahahaha!

3328
01:57:29,900 --> 01:57:30,920
It's like...

01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:31,800

Win some form of category in a Vtuber award.

3332
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:37,480
As Doki Bird.

3333
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:38,880
Um...

3334
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:40,680
Where's my goals list?

3335
01:57:40,780 --> 01:57:41,100
There you go.

3336
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:42,560
That's my final goal.

3337
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:45,520
Win a cat...

3338
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:49,120
A category for a Vtuber award.

3339
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:51,960
Yeah.

3340
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:52,300
Yeah.

3341
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:53,480
I think...

3342
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:55,660
That is...

3343
01:57:55,660 --> 01:57:57,260
I don't know.

3344
01:57:57,340 --> 01:57:58,520
I don't know if there's anything I want to do.

3345
01:57:58,760 --> 01:57:59,680
Other than these.

3346
01:58:00,820 --> 01:58:01,300
Um...

3347
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:04,380
Um...

3348
01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:06,800
I would love to win a category...

3349
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:07,780
For a...

3350
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:09,680
For a Vtuber award.

3351
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:11,300
It doesn't matter what category.

3352
01:58:11,540 --> 01:58:12,120
I'm fine with any.

3353
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:13,040
I just want one.

3354
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:13,960
Hahahaha!

3355
01:58:16,580 --> 01:58:17,540
I just...

3356
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:19,920
I just want one in general.

3357
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:21,780
So...

3358
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:24,540
Let's just hope in the future.

3359
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:26,420
At the end of the year.

3360
01:58:27,060 --> 01:58:29,220
Because it's almost award season.

3361
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:31,720
It's almost the end of the year.

3362
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:33,780
We all know what happens at the end of the year.

3363
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:35,860
Every fucking award season.

3364
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:36,980
Hahahaha!

3365
01:58:42,150 --> 01:58:42,770
So...

3366
01:58:42,770 --> 01:58:43,290
Uh...

3367
01:58:43,290 --> 01:58:43,930
That's hope...

3368
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:46,390
I hope that's possible.

3369
01:58:46,650 --> 01:58:47,450
I really do.

3370
01:58:47,730 --> 01:58:48,710
Especially as...

3371
01:58:51,010 --> 01:58:52,250
As Doki.

3372
01:58:52,770 --> 01:58:53,390
Um...

3373
01:58:55,190 --> 01:58:55,710
But yeah...

3374
01:58:55,710 --> 01:58:57,190
I think that's really...

3375
01:58:58,610 --> 01:59:00,090
That's really like...

3376
01:59:00,710 --> 01:59:01,610
I guess like...

3377
01:59:01,610 --> 01:59:03,810
All the things I really want to accomplish within the year.

3378
01:59:04,810 --> 01:59:06,170
Or like not within the year.

3379
01:59:06,390 --> 01:59:08,090
But like for my long term goals.

3380
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:09,190
At this point.

3381
01:59:10,990 --> 01:59:12,930
It's hard to think of new goals these days.

3382
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:14,270
Because it's like...

3383
01:59:14,990 --> 01:59:16,070
I accomplished so much.

3384
01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:19,210
Despite how short time...

3385
01:59:19,210 --> 01:59:19,990
I've been around.

3386
01:59:21,230 --> 01:59:21,710
Um...

3387
01:59:23,090 --> 01:59:23,790
It's been what?

3388
01:59:23,850 --> 01:59:24,350
6 months?

3389
01:59:25,190 --> 01:59:25,390
Hahaha!

3390
01:59:25,470 --> 01:59:26,450
It's been...

3391
01:59:27,090 --> 01:59:27,650
Damn!

3392
01:59:27,930 --> 01:59:28,930
It's actually been like...

3393
01:59:28,930 --> 01:59:30,130
It's been 6 months right?

3394
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:30,730
7 months?

3395
01:59:30,990 --> 01:59:32,150
Has it been 7 or 6 months?

3396
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:33,190
I've honestly lost track.

3397
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:33,910
Hahaha!

3398
01:59:35,490 --> 01:59:36,050
Hahaha!

3399
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:38,490
Um...

3400
01:59:39,190 --> 01:59:40,790
I've honestly like...

3401
01:59:40,790 --> 01:59:43,330
Lost track of...

3402
01:59:44,310 --> 01:59:44,870
Um...

3403
01:59:44,870 --> 01:59:46,650
Lost track of everything.

3404
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:48,170
In terms of like time.

3405
01:59:48,370 --> 01:59:49,650
5 months?!

3406
01:59:49,650 --> 01:59:52,330
It's only been 5 m...

3407
01:59:52,330 --> 01:59:53,230
Oh my god!

3408
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:54,330
Hahaha!

3409
01:59:55,250 --> 01:59:57,330
Has it really only been...

3410
01:59:57,330 --> 01:59:58,730
5 months?!

3411
01:59:58,730 --> 01:59:59,910
That's crazy!

3412
02:00:00,210 --> 02:00:00,850
Oh my gosh!

3413
02:00:01,110 --> 02:00:03,130
I did not realize...

3414
02:00:03,130 --> 02:00:04,150
That...

3415
02:00:04,150 --> 02:00:07,250
5 months has passed in like...

3416
02:00:07,250 --> 02:00:07,710
Gosh!

3417
02:00:07,790 --> 02:00:08,810
I've fucking been speed running.

3418
02:00:09,050 --> 02:00:09,390
Hahaha!

3419
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:13,130
I've fucking been like speed running...

3420
02:00:13,130 --> 02:00:15,270
Like my fucking...

3421
02:00:15,270 --> 02:00:16,150
Vtuber career.

3422
02:00:17,070 --> 02:00:18,270
Dad you're not...

3423
02:00:18,270 --> 02:00:20,630
Dad's parking outside my door.

3424
02:00:20,830 --> 02:00:21,330
Hahaha!

3425
02:00:21,330 --> 02:00:21,510
Hahaha!

3426
02:00:22,270 --> 02:00:23,110
Hahaha!

3427
02:00:25,110 --> 02:00:25,530
Um...

3428
02:00:25,530 --> 02:00:27,170
Um...

3429
02:00:29,230 --> 02:00:29,650
Yeah...

3430
02:00:29,650 --> 02:00:31,170
Oh my god.

3431
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:31,810
I...

3432
02:00:31,810 --> 02:00:34,830
It's hard to believe that it's actually 5 months.

3433
02:00:35,030 --> 02:00:35,450
Hahaha!

3434
02:00:35,710 --> 02:00:39,670
For all of this happening.

3435
02:00:40,850 --> 02:00:41,690
Um...

3436
02:00:41,690 --> 02:00:43,490
But like...

3437
02:00:43,490 --> 02:00:45,570
Honestly like...

3438
02:00:45,570 --> 02:00:46,190
Uh...

3439
02:00:46,190 --> 02:00:47,030
No guys!

3440
02:00:47,210 --> 02:00:47,950
Don't enable!

3441
02:00:47,950 --> 02:00:50,870
We're not here to enable behaviors!

3442
02:00:51,230 --> 02:00:51,690
Guys!

3443
02:00:51,950 --> 02:00:54,110
We're not here to enable behaviors!

3444
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:55,570
Everybody!

3445
02:00:55,790 --> 02:00:58,270
We're here to like...

3446
02:00:58,270 --> 02:00:59,250
Wait!

3447
02:00:59,290 --> 02:01:00,950
You've been inside this entire time?

3448
02:01:01,670 --> 02:01:02,630
Oh my god!

3449
02:01:02,730 --> 02:01:03,670
I thought...

3450
02:01:03,670 --> 02:01:04,150
Hahaha!

3451
02:01:04,230 --> 02:01:04,610
Wait!

3452
02:01:04,810 --> 02:01:05,690
Where were you?

3453
02:01:06,190 --> 02:01:06,870
Wait!

3454
02:01:06,970 --> 02:01:07,510
Hahaha!

3455
02:01:08,370 --> 02:01:09,490
He's just...

3456
02:01:09,490 --> 02:01:12,590
He's actually been in my room this entire time!

3457
02:01:13,090 --> 02:01:13,770
Hahaha!

3458
02:01:15,510 --> 02:01:16,190
Okay!

3459
02:01:17,950 --> 02:01:18,450
Oh my god!

3460
02:01:18,510 --> 02:01:19,470
When did you...

3461
02:01:19,470 --> 02:01:19,870
What?

3462
02:01:20,010 --> 02:01:20,710
Where were you?

3463
02:01:21,110 --> 02:01:23,630
He was sitting behind me!

3464
02:01:23,970 --> 02:01:24,910
Oh my god!

3465
02:01:24,950 --> 02:01:25,570
He was like...

3466
02:01:25,570 --> 02:01:27,070
Sitting behind me!

3467
02:01:27,330 --> 02:01:28,590
This entire time!

3468
02:01:28,810 --> 02:01:30,350
I didn't notice!

3469
02:01:30,890 --> 02:01:31,850
Oh my god!

3470
02:01:32,030 --> 02:01:32,730
I... Cause like...

3471
02:01:32,730 --> 02:01:34,310
When I opened the door...

3472
02:01:34,310 --> 02:01:36,470
To like let him out...

3473
02:01:36,470 --> 02:01:38,430
He like... just...

3474
02:01:38,430 --> 02:01:39,770
He like... He wasn't there!

3475
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:42,710
Cause like I didn't look down when I opened the door.

3476
02:01:42,730 --> 02:01:44,570
I opened the door and then I waited.

3477
02:01:44,570 --> 02:01:46,630
And then I looked down and he wasn't there.

3478
02:01:46,810 --> 02:01:48,030
So I assumed he left.

3479
02:01:48,210 --> 02:01:50,450
But he was sitting behind me this entire time!

3480
02:01:50,830 --> 02:01:52,030
I didn't even...

3481
02:01:52,030 --> 02:01:53,670
Cause then when I heard the barking I was like...

3482
02:01:53,670 --> 02:01:54,070
Okay fine!

3483
02:01:54,190 --> 02:01:54,930
I'm gonna let you in!

3484
02:01:55,190 --> 02:01:56,130
Like I was like... Fuck it!

3485
02:01:56,170 --> 02:01:57,030

3486
02:01:57,330 --> 02:01:57,990
I'm gonna let you in!

3487
02:01:58,290 --> 02:02:00,770
And then... I looked down and there he was!

3488
02:02:01,090 --> 02:02:01,710
In my room!

3489
02:02:02,930 --> 02:02:03,330
Leave!

3490
02:02:04,030 --> 02:02:04,430
Hahaha!

3491
02:02:06,030 --> 02:02:06,430
Okay!

3492
02:02:07,550 --> 02:02:07,950
Now...

3493
02:02:09,270 --> 02:02:10,290
Now he's gone!

3494
02:02:10,450 --> 02:02:11,010
Now he's gone!

3495
02:02:11,010 --> 02:02:11,650
Now he's...

3496
02:02:11,650 --> 02:02:14,550
Now he's actually gone!

3497
02:02:14,950 --> 02:02:15,670
Hahaha!

3498
02:02:18,850 --> 02:02:20,290
Oh my god!

3499
02:02:20,610 --> 02:02:22,770
Um... He's gone for real now!

3500
02:02:22,970 --> 02:02:25,190
He's left... He's left the room!

3501
02:02:25,570 --> 02:02:26,870
Okay what was I saying?

3502
02:02:26,990 --> 02:02:28,490
God damn it dad!

3503
02:02:28,810 --> 02:02:29,310
Hahaha!

3504
02:02:29,470 --> 02:02:33,050
He fucking distracted me!

3505
02:02:33,130 --> 02:02:34,510
I don't remember what...

3506
02:02:34,510 --> 02:02:36,910
He distracted my conversation... my fucking...

3507
02:02:36,910 --> 02:02:37,790
Topic!

3508
02:02:37,790 --> 02:02:38,770
I don't remember what was on!

3509
02:02:39,770 --> 02:02:40,490
Um...

3510
02:02:41,010 --> 02:02:41,890
What was I talking about?

3511
02:02:42,190 --> 02:02:42,530
Fuck!

3512
02:02:42,890 --> 02:02:43,590
Hahaha!

3513
02:02:44,830 --> 02:02:45,270
Hahaha!

3514
02:02:46,030 --> 02:02:47,770
Don't blame him!

3515
02:02:47,990 --> 02:02:49,830
He's a good boy!

3516
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:52,990
He's a good boy!

3517
02:02:56,530 --> 02:02:58,290
Oh yeah!

3518
02:02:59,850 --> 02:03:00,730
Um...

3519
02:03:01,690 --> 02:03:02,570
Huh!

3520
02:03:03,910 --> 02:03:04,790
Um...

3521
02:03:04,790 --> 02:03:06,590
But yeah...

3522
02:03:06,590 --> 02:03:06,890
It's...

3523
02:03:08,570 --> 02:03:10,790
It's... It's crazy...

3524
02:03:11,010 --> 02:03:12,790
Um... Just to think about...

3525
02:03:12,790 --> 02:03:14,950
Because like... You know...

3526
02:03:15,830 --> 02:03:17,130
Okay I'm gonna get mushy here!

3527
02:03:17,290 --> 02:03:18,030
I'm gonna get mushy!

3528
02:03:18,210 --> 02:03:18,690
Before...

3529
02:03:18,690 --> 02:03:19,970
Because you know... We still have to...

3530
02:03:19,970 --> 02:03:21,290
We still have to make a wish!

3531
02:03:21,430 --> 02:03:22,390
We still have to blow our candles!

3532
02:03:22,850 --> 02:03:24,510
But... I'm gonna get mushy here!

3533
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:25,230
Guys!

3534
02:03:25,270 --> 02:03:26,490
I'm gonna get... Uh...

3535
02:03:26,490 --> 02:03:27,350
Really mushy here!

3536
02:03:27,910 --> 02:03:28,390
But...

3537
02:03:29,010 --> 02:03:30,470
Um... You know... After...

3538
02:03:31,930 --> 02:03:32,890
Um... Everything...

3539
02:03:32,890 --> 02:03:33,910
Like I'm gonna get a little emotional!

3540
02:03:34,310 --> 02:03:34,790
Hahaha!

3541
02:03:35,670 --> 02:03:36,550
A little...

3542
02:03:36,550 --> 02:03:37,490
A little emotional here!

3543
02:03:39,110 --> 02:03:39,590
Um...

3544
02:03:40,230 --> 02:03:40,710
But...

3545
02:03:41,010 --> 02:03:43,290
After like... Everything that happened...

3546
02:03:44,030 --> 02:03:44,750
Um...

3547
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:46,470
You know... I...

3548
02:03:46,470 --> 02:03:48,890
Did not... You know... I thought...

3549
02:03:48,890 --> 02:03:50,970
My life... As a...

3550
02:03:50,970 --> 02:03:52,130
Content creator...

3551
02:03:52,130 --> 02:03:53,150
Was over!

3552
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:57,190
And... Um...

3553
02:03:57,190 --> 02:03:58,530
That really like...

3554
02:03:58,530 --> 02:04:01,190
All the hard work... And like all the effort...

3555
02:04:01,550 --> 02:04:02,890
To make I Smile and Laugh...

3556
02:04:02,890 --> 02:04:05,050
Would be like... Gone... Basically...

3557
02:04:05,050 --> 02:04:06,890
Uh... And...

3558
02:04:06,890 --> 02:04:08,170
But... I'm still here!

3559
02:04:08,430 --> 02:04:09,290
I'm still here!

3560
02:04:09,870 --> 02:04:10,590
And...

3561
02:04:11,470 --> 02:04:12,210
Uh...

3562
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:14,530
You know like... Some people...

3563
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:17,130
Don't even get their like... First...

3564
02:04:17,130 --> 02:04:18,550
Big break...

3565
02:04:18,550 --> 02:04:20,750
Like their first lucky big break...

3566
02:04:20,750 --> 02:04:22,830
Cause... You know... Making it...

3567
02:04:22,830 --> 02:04:24,310
Really relies on...

3568
02:04:24,310 --> 02:04:26,570
A lot of luck... Uh...

3569
02:04:26,570 --> 02:04:28,770
I always said like... To make it big...

3570
02:04:28,770 --> 02:04:30,630
It's mostly about luck...

3571
02:04:30,630 --> 02:04:32,990
And how you capitalize on it...

3572
02:04:32,990 --> 02:04:34,430
And... But...

3573
02:04:34,430 --> 02:04:36,790
I got second... I got two...

3574
02:04:37,730 --> 02:04:38,470
And...

3575
02:04:39,010 --> 02:04:40,990
If one... If the one percent...

3576
02:04:41,010 --> 02:04:42,130
Is making it...

3577
02:04:42,130 --> 02:04:45,450
The first time... As like your lucky big break...

3578
02:04:45,590 --> 02:04:47,130
Having the opportunity...

3579
02:04:47,770 --> 02:04:48,730
To do it...

3580
02:04:48,730 --> 02:04:49,950
A second time...

3581
02:04:50,710 --> 02:04:53,130
Is like... Finding a...

3582
02:04:53,130 --> 02:04:53,890
Leprechaun...

3583
02:04:58,750 --> 02:05:01,070
It's like... Actually like...

3584
02:05:01,070 --> 02:05:07,670
The 0.0000001% To do it...

3585
02:05:07,670 --> 02:05:09,370
A second time...

3586
02:05:09,730 --> 02:05:10,830
And...

3587
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:13,410
To basically have like... A restart...

3588
02:05:13,410 --> 02:05:15,090
Um... And...

3589
02:05:15,730 --> 02:05:16,890
Um...

3590
02:05:16,890 --> 02:05:18,430
Is...

3591
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:20,990
Really crazy to think about...

3592
02:05:20,990 --> 02:05:21,710
That...

3593
02:05:23,010 --> 02:05:25,050
I was able to accomplish all of this...

3594
02:05:25,050 --> 02:05:26,930
As an indie... Cause...

3595
02:05:26,930 --> 02:05:28,510
Normally you don't see...

3596
02:05:28,510 --> 02:05:30,830
Indies... Getting these...

3597
02:05:30,830 --> 02:05:33,050
Opportunities... And...

3598
02:05:33,050 --> 02:05:34,930
Getting... These...

3599
02:05:34,930 --> 02:05:36,510
Things... Like...

3600
02:05:36,510 --> 02:05:38,790
I think like... Um...

3601
02:05:38,790 --> 02:05:40,990
Especially women like... Um...

3602
02:05:41,010 --> 02:05:42,790
I guess like... NA slash EU...

3603
02:05:42,790 --> 02:05:45,290
Vtubers... Um... Before me...

3604
02:05:45,290 --> 02:05:46,710
Only like...

3605
02:05:46,710 --> 02:05:48,950
What... ShyLily and Shoto...

3606
02:05:48,950 --> 02:05:50,330
Had Nendoroids...

3607
02:05:51,010 --> 02:05:51,870
Um...

3608
02:05:51,870 --> 02:05:54,790
For like... Indie Vtubers...

3609
02:05:54,790 --> 02:05:56,310
In the western side...

3610
02:05:56,860 --> 02:05:58,930
So... To be like... Now...

3611
02:05:58,930 --> 02:06:01,010
It's Philly and I... We both got...

3612
02:06:01,010 --> 02:06:02,470
Nendoroids now... Um...

3613
02:06:03,010 --> 02:06:04,770
And... It's...

3614
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:06,230
Crazy to think about...

3615
02:06:07,010 --> 02:06:09,370
Because... You would normally think...

3616
02:06:09,370 --> 02:06:10,570
That...

3617
02:06:11,010 --> 02:06:12,570
You know... You have to be...

3618
02:06:12,570 --> 02:06:14,370
Uh... Under a...

3619
02:06:14,370 --> 02:06:16,810
Corporate banner... To be able to achieve...

3620
02:06:16,810 --> 02:06:19,070
A lot of these things... Um...

3621
02:06:19,070 --> 02:06:20,810
And... Yeah... You can say like...

3622
02:06:20,810 --> 02:06:22,550
Oh... But Doki... Like... You've...

3623
02:06:22,550 --> 02:06:25,090
You've worked under these conditions before...

3624
02:06:25,090 --> 02:06:27,190
And you benefit from... That...

3625
02:06:28,090 --> 02:06:28,610
Um...

3626
02:06:30,030 --> 02:06:31,070
But... I...

3627
02:06:31,070 --> 02:06:32,790
Now I'm just an indie...

3628
02:06:32,790 --> 02:06:34,490
Um... I don't really have...

3629
02:06:34,910 --> 02:06:36,670
The support structures...

3630
02:06:36,670 --> 02:06:38,350
That comes with being in a company...

3631
02:06:39,270 --> 02:06:40,310
And... Um...

3632
02:06:42,030 --> 02:06:42,550
And...

3633
02:06:42,550 --> 02:06:44,650
I don't really have like... You know...

3634
02:06:44,650 --> 02:06:46,170
And... I had to do a lot of this...

3635
02:06:46,170 --> 02:06:48,910
With my own team that I created...

3636
02:06:48,910 --> 02:06:50,290
Uh... And...

3637
02:06:50,290 --> 02:06:52,490
Being able to go through it...

3638
02:06:52,810 --> 02:06:54,990
Like... Day by day... That's why I've been overwhelmed...

3639
02:06:54,990 --> 02:06:56,490
A lot too... Behind the scenes...

3640
02:06:57,010 --> 02:06:59,030
Um... Because it was...

3641
02:06:59,030 --> 02:07:00,330
It's a lot of work...

3642
02:07:00,850 --> 02:07:02,290
It's a lot...

3643
02:07:03,010 --> 02:07:05,430
To do it all...

3644
02:07:05,430 --> 02:07:07,490
I don't know how the other indies...

3645
02:07:07,490 --> 02:07:09,090
Do it... Um...

3646
02:07:09,090 --> 02:07:10,710
But... It's why I haven't been like...

3647
02:07:10,710 --> 02:07:12,750
Really active... I mean...

3648
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:13,990
I've never really been active on...

3649
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:16,130
Interacting on Twitter...

3650
02:07:16,820 --> 02:07:18,730
Um... So... I don't know how...

3651
02:07:18,730 --> 02:07:21,290
Other big indies interact on Twitter...

3652
02:07:21,290 --> 02:07:22,650
A lot... And like...

3653
02:07:22,650 --> 02:07:24,310
Do like... Social media...

3654
02:07:24,310 --> 02:07:25,250
Really well...

3655
02:07:28,930 --> 02:07:30,830
When I see Shy Lily...

3656
02:07:30,830 --> 02:07:31,130
When I see Shy Lily...

3657
02:07:31,130 --> 02:07:33,270
Replying to like... So many tweets...

3658
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:35,190
And like... Watching... And like... Supporting...

3659
02:07:35,190 --> 02:07:36,890
So many other Vtubers...

3660
02:07:36,890 --> 02:07:39,290
I don't know how she has all that time...

3661
02:07:39,290 --> 02:07:41,210
To do that... I really admire her...

3662
02:07:41,210 --> 02:07:42,350
Um... Because like...

3663
02:07:42,740 --> 02:07:44,530
Um... During the Skinsuit...

3664
02:07:45,810 --> 02:07:46,890
Um... Skinsuit...

3665
02:07:46,890 --> 02:07:48,890
Debut... Like... Um...

3666
02:07:49,530 --> 02:07:50,670
Um... Day after...

3667
02:07:50,670 --> 02:07:53,030
Shy Lily messaged me... Like... In support...

3668
02:07:53,030 --> 02:07:54,970
And was like... Oh my god... This is such an amazing...

3669
02:07:54,970 --> 02:07:56,570
Debut... And everything...

3670
02:07:56,570 --> 02:07:58,730
And all that stuff... And like... The fact that she...

3671
02:07:58,730 --> 02:08:00,690
Like... Took that extra step to like...

3672
02:08:00,690 --> 02:08:03,090
You know... Interact with me... Um...

Social media... Like...

3676
02:08:08,330 --> 02:08:10,830
I don't know how she finds the time...

3677
02:08:10,830 --> 02:08:12,850
To balance all of this... Like...

3678
02:08:12,850 --> 02:08:15,010
She is... Incredibly hardworking...

3679
02:08:15,010 --> 02:08:16,670
Being able to balance all of that...

3680
02:08:16,670 --> 02:08:18,830
Cause I'm still learning...

3681
02:08:18,830 --> 02:08:20,270
I'm... I'm... I'm...

3682
02:08:20,610 --> 02:08:21,830
I'm still learning...

3683
02:08:23,010 --> 02:08:24,910
I don't... I don't know...

3684
02:08:24,910 --> 02:08:26,830
How people do this...

3685
02:08:26,830 --> 02:08:28,470
Even Mint... Mint...

3686
02:08:28,470 --> 02:08:30,530
Is able to balance... So... Like...

3687
02:08:30,530 --> 02:08:33,010
You know... Like... Mint is able to balance...

3688
02:08:33,010 --> 02:08:35,030
Like... Interacting with others...

3689
02:08:35,030 --> 02:08:36,830
Um... In a much... Much...

3690
02:08:36,890 --> 02:08:39,370
Much more personal level... When it comes to like...

3691
02:08:39,370 --> 02:08:39,830
Um...

3692
02:08:39,830 --> 02:08:42,530
Social media interactions... And like...

3693
02:08:42,530 --> 02:08:44,410
Stuff with her own streams... And like...

3694
02:08:44,410 --> 02:08:46,650
Her own behind the scenes work as well...

3695
02:08:46,650 --> 02:08:48,530
And... I'm still learning!

3696
02:08:49,110 --> 02:08:50,650
I'm still learning...

3697
02:08:54,710 --> 02:08:56,650
Oh my gosh... It's...

3698
02:08:56,650 --> 02:08:57,890
It's a lot of work...

3699
02:08:57,890 --> 02:08:59,790
It's definitely a lot...

3700
02:08:59,790 --> 02:09:02,130

3704
02:09:08,610 --> 02:09:11,010
And passion... You put into your career and community...

3705
02:09:11,010 --> 02:09:13,130
Six months ago... Did you imagine you'd get this far?

3706
02:09:13,210 --> 02:09:14,590
No... Absolutely not...

3707
02:09:15,370 --> 02:09:16,950
Hahaha... Um... I didn't even think...

3708
02:09:16,950 --> 02:09:18,050
I was gonna get a Nendoroid...

3709
02:09:18,050 --> 02:09:20,950
We hope you're happy and look forward to the future...

3710
02:09:20,950 --> 02:09:22,970
Thank you... Thank you for the Akasupa... Thank you... Thank you...

02:09:22,970 --> 02:09:25,070
I hope I'll get more figures in the future...

3712
02:09:25,070 --> 02:09:26,750
Like... I hope I'll get a scaled figure...

3713
02:09:26,750 --> 02:09:28,930
Um... In the future... Um...

3714
02:09:28,930 --> 02:09:30,850
I didn't put in a goals list... Because...

3715
02:09:30,850 --> 02:09:33,170
You know... I don't wanna ask for too much... I already have...

3716
02:09:33,170 --> 02:09:35,270
A... I think like... Having a Nendoroid...

3717
02:09:35,270 --> 02:09:36,670
Is like...

3718
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:39,190
To the point where you know... You sort of...

3719
02:09:39,190 --> 02:09:40,810
Made it... type deal...

3720
02:09:40,810 --> 02:09:42,630
Because like... Um...

3721
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:45,070
It's a fucking Nendoroid...

3722
02:09:45,950 --> 02:09:46,750
Hahaha...

3723
02:09:47,270 --> 02:09:48,290
Hahaha...

3724
02:09:48,290 --> 02:09:51,590
Hahaha... That's like... Sort of like...

3725
02:09:51,590 --> 02:09:52,870
When you know... Like...

3726
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:54,850
You sort of... You've made it...

3727
02:09:54,850 --> 02:09:55,790
Hahaha...

3728
02:09:56,890 --> 02:09:59,230
Like... You're literally...

3729

You're... You're... You're a Dem!

That's me!

3733
02:10:06,250 --> 02:10:08,950
So that's why I didn't put scale figure... Because I'm like...

3734
02:10:08,950 --> 02:10:11,170
Alright... I don't wanna ask for too much right now...

3735
02:10:11,170 --> 02:10:13,110
Hahaha... I already got that...

3736
02:10:14,290 --> 02:10:14,910
