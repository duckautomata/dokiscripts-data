1
00:01:49,390 --> 00:02:12,150
like hello not mentally but like i'm i'm alive physically my brain might not be in this plane of existence but like my soul might not be here but my physical disgusting human husk of a body is here

2
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,570
I'm sorry.

3
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,150
I'm so sorry.

4
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,610
I lost the nap, gotcha.

5
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,810
Yet again.

6
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,750
I keep thinking the rates are so shit.

7
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,050
But I keep thinking this is it.

8
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,870
I'm going to get my pity right here.

9
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,950
Right now.

10
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,390
I will get the pity roll.

11
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,370
Well, I never learned.

12
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:57,730
And I was like, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna take a little two to three hour nap-a-roony, and then I will feel so refreshed.

13
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,330
Because this is it.

14
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,430
This is that moment.

15
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,430
It's gonna happen.

16
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,310
Today's the day.

17
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,670
And then it's never that day.

18
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,090
I don't understand.

19
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,950
I don't understand.

20
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,670
Why is it never today?

21
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,730
I don't understand.

22
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,470
I work so hard.

23
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,190
Why is it never to that today?

24
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,770
Folly, thank you for the super chat.

25
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,110
Thank you.

26
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:27,550
Thank you.

27
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,710
Tired, eh?

28
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,870
Mr. Broken Volly, thank you.

29
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,730

Thank you.

32
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,690
Hey, Jokey.

33
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,190
So here's an idea for the next game to play Halo 2.

34
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,870
It's the easiest one to finish.

35
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,710
It only takes two to three streams to finish.

36
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,930
Honestly, thank you for the magenta super.

37
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:42,850
Thank you.

38
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,650
Thank you.

39
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,570
No name.

40
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,470
Thank you for the super chat.

41
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:46,810
Thank you.

42
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,290
Thank you.

43
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,430
You're so asleep.

44
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,770
This is just a figment of your imagination.

45
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,310
Thank you for the super chat.

46
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:53,770
Thank you.

47
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:54,610
Thank you.

48
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:55,970
Oh my gosh.

49
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:56,910
But yeah.

50
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,350
Um, it was so messed up.

51
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,270
Because I literally I got I set up in line right for like five.

52
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:13,650
Like I even pushed it to six because I knew I knew today I was like not like when I was making that schedule because you know I posted a schedule at two in the morning.

53
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,930
Um, so I was like, I know I ain't gonna wake up.

54
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,370
I know I won't be ready at 5 p.m.

55
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,410
I knew it.

56
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,030
Like, in my heart, I was like, don't kid yourself, Doki.

57
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,550
Today's not the 5 p.m.

58
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:27,970
day.

59
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,250
I know.

60
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,470
Like, we always do 5 p.m.

61
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,090
PST.

62
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,670
But, like, I was just like, who are you kidding, Doki?

63
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,730
You posted your schedule at 2 in the morning.

64
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,190
You're not okay.

65
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,410
You need that extra hour.

66
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,990
I was like, like the random 6 p.m.

67
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,870
You know, whenever I put 6 p.m.

68
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,230
Like, you're like, something's wrong.

69
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,610
Like, something happens on that day.

70
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:05,730
Like, like, something is going on, like, if she posts, like, because it's just so weird.

71
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,750
Like, usually, it's rarely ever, it's 6 p.m.

72
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,250
I've always been, like, 5 p.m.

73
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,010
on the dot.

74
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,850
But it's like, I knew, and I was like, I knew it.

75
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:27,590
I was like, like i told you i told you like it was a sign and it did my body knew could read the fucking future

76
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:47,430
but it's like i set my alarm at 5 45 um i woke up but i was just like oh no I didn't get the gotcha.

77
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,170
I was like, I don't understand though.

78
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:57,230
Like, surely like some, something will be different.

79
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:04,270
Like, surely, I was like, I thought today was the day though.

80
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,050
I don't understand.

81
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,290
Was today not the day?

82
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,890
Why did it not?

83
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,450

Just stared off, like, into the void.

88
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,190
And I'm just like, I stared off into the void.

89
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,570
And I was just like...

90
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,150
Because afraid I was, like, slowly booting up, I guess.

91
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,830
And I was like, wait, what time is it?

92
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,310

93
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:39,670
Oh.

I was like, oh, no, it's, it's 605.

101
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:12,530
Yeah, I was downloading the Doki updates in between.

00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,970
Like, I'm Doki.

00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,930

Next day, got the job I wanted.

112
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:32,890
Coincidence?

113
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,010
I think not.

114

I'm glad you guys enjoyed the director's.

119
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,910
I know I should have made the waiting room a lot earlier.

120
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,910
But, like, I was like, fuck it.

121
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,690
Because I got the file.

122
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,390
I did tell you guys.

123
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:58,130
I was like, we might potentially get the video by the end of the week.

124
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,350
I did say it.

125
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,850
I got the file.

126
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,090
And I was just like, upload.

127
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,310
And I was just like, all right.

128
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,490
That's enough of a war.

129
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,570
That's enough time.

130
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,050
I know I should give you guys more of a waiting period.

131
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,210
But I was just like, bro, I got the file.

132
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,550
And to be fair, like.

133
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:52,850
um it's not like it was like super new there were like i mean like it is a director's cut so we did have like you know a new song the encore and uh like the new choreo uh for escape for the city and and like uh refreshed new like small little edits for like um visuals and stuff so yeah i was so happy with um it did take a while to do like all the um to get the polished version out like yeah It was much more polished and everything like all the little things I wanted to fix got fixed and everything But yes,

134
00:09:52,870 --> 00:11:09,030
I told you guys you would not expect the encore I was like you're not never gonna guess the song I picked for the encore I I was like you guys ain't gonna expect as I was so proud of myself I was like oh my I was so proud of myself for the encore song that I fit because it was like it was genius like because who the fuck would i don't know who the fuck would do han solo and who the fuck would do i'm han solo um at a v for a vtuber concert but i was just like bro i've always wanted to do the connect dance and it's like it's so easy to really do the trash compactor i think my favorite one is the um fuck i don't remember what it's called the fucking the little bike thing that was my favorite move i honestly that's it's like and then the shoulder polish yeah the shoulder polish yeah that one was good too yeah i felt like i love the one person who did the edit where they put the fucking um star wars connect dance symbols and like star wars connect shit like on the side like to like like as

135
00:11:09,030 --> 00:12:03,250
if we're actually playing the connect okay you guys i'm idea that song has been living rent free in my head for fucking years ever since i think like ever since like john tron and game crumbs did that like the the series i guess it was john i yeah like oh my god like ever since like john tron did the fucking original video of the the star wars connection like oh my god and then like he did the remaster and where the game crumbs were a guest and stuff on um on at the end like i that's been like in my head i feel like i've been like thinking about that song for so fucking long and i was like you know it i had to make that my dreams come true i was like that's why i became a youtube i was just like one day i will dance i

136
00:12:11,110 --> 00:13:38,950
I had to do it like I with great power comes great shitposts don't let your dreams be dreams I had it was the only chance I get it's such a good song I just found out when I did the the the when I did like the the song recording for it because they were like who's the artist and I never thought of like I never thought about how this song was an actual real song I thought they made this song just for the Star Wars connect but then I found out that like this was a real song and it was from fucking Jason DeRule what's his name Jason DeRuleau I just found out it's a real fucking song I didn't realize it was a it was a pair I thought they were like well I can't believe they this is such a good song that they made um for for this to connect and then they I realized they had um a lot of like other pairs like it's not just Han Solo like there's other songs in the game like I know I I was like what they do it's I was like what more than just i'm on solo there's other songs um you know which is

137
00:13:38,950 --> 00:14:11,310
which in hindsight they're they're yeah like they're in hindsight yeah because it's a dance game so they had why i don't know if you guys know this but they have ymca as well um but it's like the okay the lyrics for it is so because i was like at that point i was in my own little rabbit hole of like all the other like stupid fucking parodies that they do.

138
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,150
Let me see if I can find it.

139
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:13,310
Okay.

140
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,050
Star Wars.

141
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:22,910
I remember one of them was like YMCA, but it was like it was different.

142
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:34,470
It was very it was like it was the same, but also it was Boba Fett dancing too, which is pretty fucking funny.

143
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,050
It was actually a lot.

144
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,950
There's so much more and a lot of them are so stupid.

145
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:50,250
Okay, so YMCA, it starts off as like, oh, okay, it's the same.

146
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,950
And then instead of YMCA, it's, let me say I can find it.

147
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,330
I need it.

148
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,010
Oh, it's okay.

149
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,270
It be in the empire today.

150
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,590
It's great to be in the empire today.

151
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:14,560
This is not the sound to say, but it's like, it's great to be in the empire today.

152
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,640
And it's when Boba Fett and the Stormtrooper was like, empire today.

153
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,540
So it's like a propaganda song.

154
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,580
Cause I was like, wait, this is YMCA.

155
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,680
Cause it's like young men.

156
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,800
I don't need to feel down.

157
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:42,320
I said young men It's like it's great to be in the empire today.

158
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:53,520
Yeah, it's great to be in the empire Because I was like, oh shit, it's just YMCA and But they changed that.

159
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,220
I was like, what the fuck?

160
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:02,300
So for those who don't hear it, it's literally this And it's like and it's the fucking stormtroopers like fucking grooving at it.

161
00:16:04,900 --> 00:17:01,560
so yeah i was like in my little own rabbit hole of like connect star wars because i was like what other songs are there but i will say obviously um um i'm hot solo what is the best one is is the is the best one but it was the other ones are also like pretty good like the uh oh yeah hologram girl instead of a holograph girl uh they're all they're all good in their own way but ihan solo like transcends reality it just it's like in its own fucking tier um but yeah no it was i'm so happy i was actually able to do that song and i think the Okay,

162
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,040
I was reading the comments.

163
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,380
Also, like, I was like, I was like, oh my god.

164
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,480
I, I was like, knew you guys were not expecting it.

165
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,220
Because who the fuck would see?

166
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,960
Like, VTuber concerts are so expensive.

167
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,700
So it's like, who the fuck would waste it on I'm Han Solo?

168
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,020
But like, who the fuck wouldn't take that opportunity?

169
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,420
Like, boom, I had thousands of dollars gone.

170
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,800
But so worth it.

171
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,440
Yeah.

172
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:46,220
I feel like for me, my entire, like, when I do performances, I just, like, I sing songs that I know, like, and perform songs that I know, like, no one else would fucking do.

173
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,800
Like, fucking do.

174
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,080
Because they're like, we gotta be serious here.

175
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,720
Like, this is a lot of money going into it.

176
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,620
I'm just like, this is a lot of money to make my shitpost come true.

177
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:52,540
up everyone could sing like i don't know the the idol anime song that you know we all know and love like we could i could also sing um i i could also sing uh i'm on solo like because at least i'd be the first one you know like you know oh my gosh i'm trying to think like I could be like um the 80th vtuber to sing this really popular vocaloid song or like this very popular oh my god what's that singer name I ate auto song but I could be the first vtuber to sing I'm on solo I could be the very first vtuber

178
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,300
Yeah, I am a pioneer.

179
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:19,340
Yeah, I could have made the 1,000th 3D performance of your idol, but I was the first to do I'm on solo.

180
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:34,080
And then what was funny was that I saw like, like I was reading the comments and, um, the pioneer of the arts.

181
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:34,780
Bravo.

182
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,520
You're so, you're a genius, Doki.

183
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,040
Bravo.

184
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,620
I'm a visionary.

185
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:56,700
Um, anyway, so I saw like the comments, you know, and someone was like, how is she able to get like permission from Disney and Star Wars and Lucas films to do this cover?

186
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,340
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, getting permission.

187
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:13,980
Yeah, I was like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, quote, like, getting the permission to do this.

188
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:44,340
Yeah, I'm just like, for those who don't know, as a fair use of the odds is pretty fun, but, um, um, yeah, so like, as an indie, It's just they just take they just take the money like like obviously the concert is not it's technically Monetized but monetized in a way where the music owners take the money So so they get the money,

189
00:20:44,440 --> 00:21:00,940
but that's okay because like, you know Yeah, just I just don't tell Disney, but like, you know, you can do cover songs It's just you can't monetize them So yeah, mostly permissions are for corporations.

190
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,420
Like I'm just a little guy.

191
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,800
So like, yeah.

192
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:14,340
So obviously, like it's most for like a lot of indies who are able to do like the songs where usually you get perms if you host an actual real.

193
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,920
You have to get perms if you host an actual real concert where people have to pay for tickets.

194
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:26,280
If it's just like a free performance and like nothing is sold.

195
00:21:26,820 --> 00:22:24,880
there's no like sales or anything um to like watch uh watch the uh concert then like you can upload it like on the internet like you don't have to worry about royalties and stuff because it's like um it's considered fine like uh just because like you're not actually monetizing it through like uh um through like sales of like like for like sales to like tickets and stuff to people um because like that's why like the phantom thief concert was never uploaded on uh like on any platforms like the official one because like i said like um some of the songs we can't even like put it online because like we don't have the perms for that like uh perms to put it online because we sold tickets for it um we have songs to perform it at the concert but we're not allowed to put it online just because like uh just because we did sold tickets to the phantom thief concert but Like the recordings is fine because it's like,

196
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,300
you know, fans recorded it.

197
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,200
So there's like, it's like such, it's like there's so many laws behind it and stuff.

198
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,760
But because this concert was free, it's free.

199
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,100
And we didn't monetize in any way.

200
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,560
Like, you know, you just have to be at anime.

201
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:48,260
And anime expo had it their own little like rule where like any song can be performed at anime expo.

202
00:22:48,260 --> 00:23:41,680
as long as like um like because they have their own little uh i don't know what's called rules and regulation regarding like copyrights for music performances so like as long as like you know we don't sell tickets for it like any song can be performed there so because of that i'm like yay yeah so it's just a little bit of like an insight on like concerts and stuff like music rights are so fucking complicated i um i hate like i hate going over music rights stuff because like it's so fucking complicated and stuff you gotta like like if you do want to like uh host like an actual real concert with like ticket sales and you know live streaming tickets you have to get like a music lawyer to look through like each song to be like to make sure it's allowed It was so,

203
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:52,500
I remember during the Phantom Feature, it was so complicated because there's so many songs we wanted to do, but we couldn't because of like, oh, the song, you can do cover songs of it online, but you can't perform it.

204
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,380
The IP laws are so confusing.

205
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,020
Like you can do like cover songs of it.

206
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,920
But you have to pay for it.

207
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,640
Licensing fee.

208
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,640
But then you can't do like concert performance of this.

209
00:24:05,040 --> 00:25:20,000
And even, and then there's some songs where you can do conference, uh, concert, not concert, concert, there's some songs where you can do concert performances but you have to pay licensing fee and then you also have to like uh but then like there's the process of the license licensing um is like so long too um but then like uploading it online is also a different fee as well so it's just there's so much stuff going on with it next day thank you the super chat thank you thank you he has the nap gotcha ever worked for you in your entire life i don't think it's a gotcha it's super chat thank you one time i remember one time it was beautiful and i've been trying to chase that high ever since that one time where i did win the gosh it was so beautiful and i'm like i might i must experience that again like i'm so writing that i still remember and every time i take that nap i'm like i need to feel that again i need to feel it again

210
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:36,460
i'm really gambling it was it was incredible i felt like i was a whole different person and i'm Like, I gotta know, I gotta feel it, kid.

211
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,980
I can't, I can't, this can't be the only time.

212
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,020
I gotta know what it was like again.

213
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,740
It was so beautiful.

214
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,640
But yeah, no, the music industry is like, it's so fucking stupid.

215
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,560
I mean, it's like, it's just like, I feel like it's just music labels.

216
00:26:02,140 --> 00:27:16,600
Because like music labels, are there to fuck with people um since the dawn of time so like music companies so like it's always been like that even with spotify you guys didn't know when spotify first uh came out like when they first like um um what's the word when spotify first came into being like music labels were like fuck spotify like we don't want to work with spot like now all of them are like you know working with spotify now um but like even then like back then they're like we don't want to put our music online yeah um and it's not even the thing is usually it's not even the music artists that get the money it's just the fucking the CEOs and like the producers of the music labels that take majority of the money too it's not like it's going back to the artists in general too that's the park um um like the producers pocket majority of the funds yeah the label like pockets most of it distributors and stuff um um what else okay so this is a long life update because um you know i

217
00:27:16,600 --> 00:28:00,240
love to yeah but anyway guys remember when uh i really want to talk about this i even wrote this down because i was like oh i gotta talk about it before i forget uh but remember when you guys were asking me i was gonna go to twitch god and i told you guys like why i don't want to go TwitchCon and then like and then it happened it's like oh shit look at all my concerns and about TwitchCon and all my concerns and like my gripes about TwitchCon like came true like my I got vindicated yeah I got validated yeah yeah I was just like yeah I was like oh no I'm never I don't think I'll ever go to Twitch guy.

218
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,520
I feel like it's just mostly like I don't think it's worth it.

219
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:13,160
And then all that shit came out and I was like yeah I'm not surprised I'm not surprised.

220
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,980
I was just like yeah like no that seems right.

221
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,180
Like I felt like something I feel like I feel like every Twitch guy just gets worse progressively worse.

222
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,320
So I was not surprised at all.

223
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:42,440
Uh, yeah, um, um, but like, okay, there was one thing I really wanted to talk about, but like, bro, like, where did all these IRL streamers come from?

224
00:28:42,760 --> 00:29:29,340
Like, so, apparently I was reading about it, like, I saw it kept coming up on my For You page, um, and it's not like the YouTube thing I'm just talking about, like, more so of, like, the IRL section, um, and apparently, like majority of convention where like irl streamers like like just taking up majority of the convention floor and i think that fucking sucks man like um and you know they're just running around with their cameras out and like blocking the fucking walkways because they're doing like they're doing some like you know content and shit but obviously you're supposed like the convention floor like no it doesn't matter what convention you have you ever been to a convention it's not a lot of space to walk around in general like not even for like streaming conventions,

225
00:29:29,480 --> 00:30:34,260
for like regular conventions there's not a lot of space to walk around and now you have these people being their cameraman and like taking up like walkways and shit to perform some fucking content for their stream but it's like mature like but they take up so much floor space because they're all like trying to do something like trying to like make content out of IRL shit and like I really wanted to rant about it because i feel like the new okay it's a little sad but i don't know if you guys realize this but the new streaming meta of 2025 is irl like it's not about gaming anymore it's not about stream like actual streamed content on the internet it's just irl stuff like that's what na people love to watch like asia is different asia people still watch gaming um and like just watch gaming but I don't know if you guys noticed this but like gaming isn't a thing anymore for streaming in NA everyone just wants to watch IRL um and like I hate the fact like I don't mind IRL because I actually

226
00:30:34,260 --> 00:31:41,580
think I personally this is what I personally think um because a lot of people want to be like the next Kai Sinat or like I show speed so like or like even the phase guys um I don't watch any of them I've seen clips of speed because I think speed is like a Kai is like up and down but like speed i think he's like super wholesome now like you know like as a kid he like you know he's still a fucking kid but like when he was a lot younger obviously he was just a child like so he um but i think speed um he actually does like really more like he doesn't his content for irl is much more like not intrusive like he's actually making like content and stuff like he's not harassing people and he um he's he's actually like making really creative content and like uh you know traveling around the world and like introducing people to different cultures and stuff um kai he has done creative shit and he also introduced like he i swear he is a hollywood plant i swear to god i just like kevin hart i i feel

227
00:31:41,580 --> 00:32:43,840
like he's a hollywood plant like but like you know he's like interacting celebrities and like bringing celebrities and um into um into like streaming and stuff and like you know like he does have like very creative moments in his like i know he like you know he does a lot of banging for subs but his content he does have like creative shit that he does which i've seen um which i i've seen in like clips this i don't watch either of them i've seen clips of it and i've seen like um clips from speed i've seen clips of sky i don't know fuck shit i don't know anything about the phase guys um but they're really fucking popular now too because they're doing their sub-a-thon thing and people were i saw like people were complaining about why are they doing sub-a-thons when they're like millionaires which makes sense i know like i know like same with like unless they're donating some of it to charity um yeah they do high production value streams not like some of the other irl streams streamers.

228
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,640
Like this is what I'm like meh about about the other IRL streamers.

229
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,540
I know someone's like, oh, what about Keso?

230
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,880
He just streamed games.

231
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,600
Yes, but he's been, he's like one, I feel like he's the only one that streams games.

232
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,320
Like you can say like, okay, there's a lot of like other streamers that are like just streams games and still get a lot of viewers.

233
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:06,320
But like, not as much as the IRL streamers these days.

234
00:33:06,940 --> 00:34:24,220
Um, but Keso is like literally the 1% of streamers right now that than the irl streamers of just playing video games um and also he's like he's pretty fucking funny too i would say yeah i i watched clips of him it's pretty he knows he's the joke but he like takes it like he he like uses it like he uses it as his like personality and so like he's like um um but yeah anyway uh and but like i i watched this i saw the clips I saw the clips of some of the IRL streamers that were popping up on my 4u page at TwitchCon and I'm like who the fuck is this guy I was just like I see like and they would have like millions of followers and shit I looked them up and they would have millions of followers on like YouTube and like their streaming so I'm like who is this guy and I feel like they popped up overnight and like and like something because I've like I've never heard of this guy before I was like is he relevant apparently he is and I'm like who is he and then like it was so gross because they

235
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:35,960
were like shoving their cameras at people's faces and just trying to make content and and then I'm like but it's all just rage bait like it wasn't even like creative they were just

236
00:34:39,060 --> 00:35:10,100
like super intrusive and like there's like no shame yeah it was so gross i was just like bro what the fuck i don't know it just i miss the old twitch i really do because it wasn't literally i think it's just the n8 current n8 meta where people are trying or where people just want to watch irl streaming now um yeah and they're not really like like it's so easy yeah i know it's so easy to farm engagement and that's why i rage bait you guys all the time um but But I am,

237
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,160
my rage bait doesn't harm society.

238
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:24,540
But my rage bait doesn't have long-term effects on your psyche.

239
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,960
But it's like, oh, they're all just trying to make content like above themselves.

240
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,200
And like, because it's just like, oh, it's me, me, me, me, me.

241
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,800
Like, and it, like, at TwitchCon, it really showed that.

242
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,240
And, like, um, like, I just, I've never heard of these people before.

243
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,940
And, and it's like, it's like, oh, my God, I do so dumb cringe shit.

244
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,740
I was, like, watching, because I was, like, looking and they're like, oh, like, reading them up.

245
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,780
Cause I was like, who are they?

246
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,700
I'm like, am I not hip with the kids anymore?

247
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,160
Like, I was like, oh my God, is it me?

248
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,180
Am I not?

249
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,060
Do I just don't under, do I just don't understand?

250
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,680
Do I just not understand anymore?

251
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:28,180
Is this what they like to watch now?

252
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,180
No, you're right.

253
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,800
It's the student's fault.

254
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:39,040
And then I saw it with like, I just think, I don't know, I think it's cringe.

255
00:36:39,060 --> 00:37:49,000
to like the cat like uh it's just it's just so cringe like what if you don't want it to be fit i think also like i think one thing also it's like what if people just because there's regular people at twitch god i feel like you know like there's regular people at twitch god and it's like these irl streamers are going up to this regular people they're not streamers you know like they're not they're not what if they don't want to be on camera and usually like a tv crew at a network is like streaming there's no it's so great the area is it's so great too i'm proud thank you for the akasupa thank you thank you one thank you for letting me know you're not a view bot guys um but like uh um like because like you know like tvs and network shows and stuff you have to sign a consent form if you get broadcasted like you know they're like oh do you want your be publicly shown on television and or like on you know streaming platforms or anything like a youtube video or shit but like streaming like

256
00:37:49,000 --> 00:38:05,360
it's such a great area because you don't have to sign a consent form in streaming you're just live like they can just show your face like like i feel like i don't know that's a little

257
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:35,640
for now yeah like they um they can just say like show like they can literally just you're live what you gonna do like it's all happening live what you gonna do about it yeah no even then you if you're on network television if you're like you know or like on a movie set Television.

258
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,780
Or like, you know, getting interviewed and stuff like that.

259
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,560
You still need to sign a consent form if you're shown on TV.

260
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,940
So that's why they blur faces.

261
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:54,060
If you're like, you're doing interviews, and then the people in the background, they blur a face because they got the consent form from the person they're interviewing and stuff.

262
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:01,680
So it's just like, but like streaming, you don't have to do that because everything is live.

263
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,080
So you don't have to ask for permission.

264
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,860
It's really, it's really weird.

265
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,580
But it's like not everyone wants to be on camera, especially if you're at a convention.

266
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:17,860
I feel so bad for these people too, because it's like, that's why I was like, yeah, I'm never going to go to TwitchCon because I had a feeling.

267
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,900
Not never, but like most likely I wouldn't.

268
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,080
Because I feel like there's cameras everywhere too.

269
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,780
It just does not feel safe.

270
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:34,800
It just, it just does not feel safe at all.

271
00:39:34,820 --> 00:40:41,880
and you guys were like oh why did you go and i'm like bro i knew that was i knew it was gonna happen i was like every year it just gets progressively worse and worse and i i had a feeling i was just like no i i knew like oh yeah and they make fun of random people i was just like i saw that they were like making fun of fucking random people that was just trying to enjoy their time at twitch con i'm like bro this guy might be like a fucking viewer bro and he's like he's so excited to meet his like favorite streamer like yeah there's some irl streamers they were just making fun of like random convention like attendees there and i was like bro like they just tried to have some fun that's why i was like i don't understand i don't understand some of these irl streamers i just don't but maybe it's because i'm not a robot and i'm a virtual girl and i'm not a maybe that's why sorry i had this was a 40 minute rant but i had to i had to talk about it because like um because it's just it was

272
00:40:41,880 --> 00:41:04,700
everywhere on my for you page anything for views yeah um it's so rude it's like they do anything for views yeah like you guys consent to me making fun of you but those guys did not also let me get um i need to get tissues real quick and blow my nose hello dad also dad's home i don't know if you guys know that he's home

273
00:41:41,670 --> 00:42:15,600
up I thought I bought more tissue boxes but I bought more top toilet paper instead um I'm gonna blow my nose with toilet paper I have too much toilet plate paper now all right I did not check I because I I got from grocery shop like online grocery shopping and I thought I ordered tissue boxes but instead I ordered More toilet papers.

274
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,080
Still paper, though.

275
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:19,880
Still paper.

276
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,520
You're right.

277
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,600
I'm stocked up in case we get the COVID 2.0.

278
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,540
You know, I'm prepped for COVID.

279
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,680
You know, anything could happen.

280
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,580
And a lot of things happened in 2025.

281
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,980
You know, I won't be surprised if somehow we get COVID 2.0.

282
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:44,040
Like, I will not be surprised.

283
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:51,720
I feel like at this point, like, anything is possible in 2025.

284
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,920
I do not speak it into existence.

285
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,280
Don't say that.

286
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,320
It's the year of sequels.

287
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:07,060
Anyway, so, disclaimer, that is a joke.

288
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:12,800
I do not, guys, for legal reasons, I hope that doesn't happen.

289
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,600
He, like, this is not me.

290
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:42,180
fuck if it does have please like i'll let you if it does have it's not my fault it's it's please do not witch hunt me i am not a witch and i did not mean for it to happen i'm so sorry oh yeah and then oh yeah sorry this has nothing to do with um covet 2.0 but like i can't believe jared leto killed the tron franchise i can't fucking

291
00:43:45,620 --> 00:44:06,020
I should be really sad, but like one man killed the Tron franchise One man killed the entire fucking beloved franchise of Tron Yeah, it was like it had an even worse opening than Morbius like I didn't think it was possible

292
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:50,860
I didn't even think it was possible to do worse than Morbius Morbius because like Morbius people were like what the fuck is Morbius you know but like everyone knows not everyone but like I know Tron but at least like Tron had like a cult following but like but it's also Jared Leto so so like I swear to God I'm like has he made a good movie like like since I don't I feel like he has not made a good movie in a very very very long time also he's a fucking creep but like that's like a different

293
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:24,780
situation so yeah no to be fair he does have his own cult following too so I was just very surprised that allegedly Jared Leno lawyers allegedly you are a creep it was just all you know it's just stuff I read online like I don't know you know it's just rumors it's just it's just rumors i'm just a ha ha silly streamer um

294
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:47,560
um anyway i just wanted to talk about anyway so sorry it's almost an hour and now we're gonna do the real content uh i'm not a robot i've heard about this quote-unquote game and i've always wanted to try it out.

295
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,780
So basically, I'm here to prove to you guys that I'm not a robot.

296
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,400
And this is like the ultimate test.

297
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:02,740
And that I am a real person and not an AI created by the government to steal your data.

298
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:08,540
So I feel like this is like the one test to prove to you guys that I'm real.

299
00:46:11,120 --> 00:47:14,140
And that 90% of people that are watching me are also not view bots bought by the government to make it seem like my channel's not dead uh dark blade thank you for the super chat thank you thank you i've been dead for like two months but as both your number one canadian and toronto chatter i don't know what your thoughts are on the toronto blue jays making the uh i thought you said mlp i was like my little pony world series but you're talking major league baseball sorry mlb world i was like what the fuck is the my little pony world world series um good for them i don't i don't know what else to say good for them uh i i don't watch baseball but you know yay blue jays uh juice uh juice caddy welcome to tomato farm welcome what sorry uh my algorithm had to i mean uh my real brain had to like remember what is the blue jays uh thank you for the super chat thank you thank you

300
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:44,040
um to play this game quote unquote game i figured we had to play the right music uh uh the right music uh to get you know for the vibe you know like the what's the word the the the aesthetic the emotion of this game itself uh so let me play something real quick that i have queued up for us

301
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:52,480
I think I feel like uh the atmosphere of this yeah

302
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,640
by human music uh

303
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:17,780

304
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:26,720
Are you, are my chatters enjoying the very real human music that I have playing for everyone on planet Earth?

305
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:31,220
It's just, no, I'm so, wow, I'm so cute.

306
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:35,020
Anyway, I'm, I feel so human now.

307
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,540
Made of only the most organic human.

308
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,600
All right, what if everyone was a bot except for?

309
00:48:45,620 --> 00:49:17,580
you yes fellow you i love my fellow humans are you enjoying the very human music we're playing tonight much fun much human zero one one zero one one zero oh my god if i was really fucked up i play ai gen you're right i should be playing ai generated music i'm not a robot all right see okay see All right.

310
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,100
Yes, fellow humans.

311
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,520
W, V, U, G, W, Q.

312
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:25,880
Look at that.

313
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,320
What?

314
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,220
W, V, U, G.

315
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:36,220
Is that W, V, U, G, W?

316
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,180
Okay, wait, maybe it's all caps.

317
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:44,400
W, yes, as a fellow human, I understood that it should be caps.

318
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,320
There we go.

319
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:56,320
vegetables, tomato, carrot, onion, corn, Mr. Potato, wait, eggplant, there we go.

320
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:05,780
Intersection, boom, beep, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, beep, beep, boop, boop, boop, beep, beep.

321
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,940
No, I got through.

322
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:13,080
It doesn't, beep, boop, boop, because I made a human error.

323
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:19,880
So then the captcha was like, oh, if you were a robot, you would know tomato is a fruit.

324
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:27,600
But they're like, oh, this person made a, this very real person made a human error.

325
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,920
So we know that they're human and I'm not a robot.

326
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,480
Just a very real human mistake.

327
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,880
Let's bring the human music down a little.

328
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:48,820
Is that better?

329
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,060
Can you guys hear it better?

330
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,160
Like, hear me better?

331
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,600
You know, like, captures?

332
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,700
It's not even about, like, what you put.

333
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,220
Like, like, real captures.

334
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,260
Obviously, this is a real capture, because this is a real test.

335
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:07,880
But, like, the other captures you do, it's not even about, like, what answers you make.

336
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,980
It's about the speed of your mouse.

337
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:13,060
Like, like, the precision and speed.

338
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,420
of your mouse movement.

339
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,420
They're testing that.

340
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,220
It doesn't fucking matter what you put.

341
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:23,200
They just want to know if your mouse is like a fucking like algorithm or some shit.

342
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:32,980
Like when you move like this or something or like precise, not like, because like that's too expensive to program, you know?

343
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,220
I mean, that's an...

344
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:35,560
What?

345
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,880
Oh my god, is this?

346
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,100
Oh my god.

347
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,060
Is this...

348
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:42,820
Okay, there you go.

350
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:50,440
there we go i did it what oh i have to win tic tac toe okay that's fine there you go i won i'm a better i mean i'm a better human than him.

351
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,160
Thank you for that observation.

352
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,240
Stop.

353
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,720
Select all squares with a stop.

354
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:02,960
Stop.

355
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,240

Wait, is there going to be an in there?

358
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,400
Stop sign.

00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,480
Where's bike?

360
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,260
Where the fuck is bike?

361
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,340

B.

366
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:45,840
B.

367
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,020
B.

368
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:46,400
B.

369
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,180
Oh, my God.

370
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,320
It's backwards.

371
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,860
Who the fuck reads backwards?

372
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,800
That's E.Kib.

373
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,100
Not bike.

374
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,120
Do I need to end as well?

375
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:04,080
Like, is this like one of those like, you didn't find end?

376
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:04,880
What?

377
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:05,680
What?

378
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:06,460
What?

379
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,580
That's messed up.

380
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,780
Okay, I don't have to enter the perpetrator's license plate.

381
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,560
Did anyone catch that license plate?

382
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:20,800
It's...

383
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,160
What is actually a real person's license plate?

384
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,200
Like...

385
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,580
Alright, stop.

386
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,560
So that all squares with a...

387
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,820
It's just...

388
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,120
What?

389
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:33,660
What?

390
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:35,460
Okay.

391
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,560
Okay.

392
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,920
That's like...

393
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:39,480
what?

394
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,360
Alright, that's fine.

395
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:45,980
There you go.

396
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:46,980
Is this cat?

397
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,500
It's like a little bit peaking.

398
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,000
Oh yeah, forgot the most important part.

399
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:51,520
That part.

400
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,520
There you go.

401
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,400
Oh my god, I'm playing whack-a-mole.

402
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,200
Oh.

403
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,380
Got you now, bitch.

404
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,240
Okay.

405
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,340
Where is Wall?

406
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,040
Oh, wait, I found him.

407
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,080
Guys, look at that.

408
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,920
My very human hands found Wall.

409
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,540
Oh, I love these.

410
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,160

01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:12,360
It's there.

511
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,000

I passed guitar.

520
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,380
I was too distracted by this couple.

521
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,420
I passed guitar, cat.

522
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:45,600
There's...

523
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,300
truck.

524
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,700
Stop with the creeping.

01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:49,900
Oh my god.

526
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,660
What happened to our legs?

527
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,060
Oh my god.

528
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,060
I zoomed in.

529
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:55,280
I had to know.

530
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:01,100
I had to know what happened to their legs.

531
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,720
Okay, wait, let me fix this.

532
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:05,300
I don't like that.

533
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:06,920
It's so zoomed in.

534
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:07,660
Let me.

535
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,100
Okay, there we go.

536
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,600
Made me very uncomfortable.

537
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:14,280
It goes.

538
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,140
Oh my god, it's not a goes.

539
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:20,820
Oh my god.

540
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:23,220
I found part of, I found his legs!

541
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:28,200
Just a couple of whiffs.

542
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:30,600
I found it, guys.

543
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:33,280
I solved the mystery of the missing legs.

544
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,300
Split up, gang.

545
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,220
Did you see it, guys?

546
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:43,040
Did you see it with your very human eyes?

547
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:50,320
Beep, beep, poop, pop, beep, beep, I do some live coding real quick.

548
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,460
0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1.

549
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,580
What did you say to me, Doki?

550
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,400
That's them zooming out.

551
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:00,340
Guitar cat.

552
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:03,180
I shall find you.

553
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:09,660
It's in a shirt?

554
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,360
I thought I'd be a cat holding a guitar.

555
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:16,640
You're telling me it's not a real cat?

556
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:19,040
I've been lied to this entire time.

557
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:22,360
you say above my motherboard?

558
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,220
What do you mean it wasn't a real cat?

559
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,280
I've been looking for a real fucking cat holding a guitar.

560
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,780
Why would that make sense?

561
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:36,400
I'm so disappointed.

562
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:38,500
Real life is just so disappointing.

563
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:42,960
It's on the orange table.

564
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:45,520
Okay.

565
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,080

Doki can read and other lies we tell ourselves.

569
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,340
Nexi, thank you for the super chat.

570
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,980

Traffic lights.

749
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:44,070
The fact that I know this is not AI, too.

750
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:44,790

751
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:46,050
I mean, it's everything.

767
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:03,860
I feel like me getting this, getting this right should prove I'm a robot.

768
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:06,960
Like, there's no, no human can do this.

769

Guys, I don't know.

832
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:02,240

839
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:50,940
his ass.

840
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:57,120
And then, like, old people aren't real.

841
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:03,280
Like, we all know, like, when you hit 30, when you hit 40, you're practically dead.

842
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:06,440
So, like, there's no way the old man's real.

01:43:01,030 --> 01:43:01,470
Okay.

898
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:06,050
Okay, we got this.

899
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:07,310
It's the cherry.

900
01:43:10,770 --> 01:43:11,770
Oh my god.

901
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:16,380
Wait, it's not even...

902
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:18,380
It's not even letting me press Z anymore.

903
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:20,640
It's good enough.

904
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:22,080
Grieve.

905
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:23,160
How do I grieve?

906
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:24,860
Oh.

907
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:25,840
I clean.

908
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:31,240
This is the grandma and the baby that ran over.

909
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:33,660
There you go.

910
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:35,120
I did it.

911
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:35,980
I agreed.

912
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:36,760
I...

913
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:37,460
Look, see?

914
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:39,500
I did feel remorse, guys.

915
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:44,480
And then I got the flowers.

916
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:48,420
What else do I have to do?

917
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:50,480
Oh, there you go.

918
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:52,260
I'm grieving.

919
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:53,880
F, I'm pressing F.

920
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:54,500
There you go.

921
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,480
See, I can feel remorse.

922
01:43:58,740 --> 01:43:59,220
Hello.

923
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:03,640
I'm not a robot.

924
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:07,640
What's making you so sure?

925
01:44:07,660 --> 01:44:39,820
sure because i don't work for the government more about what you think robots do for the robots aren't allowed to work at the government because they have no rights how do you think robot rights would change the world that's disgusting what what's the simplest about the idea of they are not human.

926
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:44,720
So they do not deserve rights.

927
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:47,640
That they...

928
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:50,600
How do you draw a line between deserving rights?

929
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,340
Human, not human.

930
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:57,460
Can you think of a scenario where that distinction becomes blurred?

931
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:58,240
No.

932
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:02,280
Can you explain why you are so certain about that?

933
01:45:02,700 --> 01:45:05,380
Because I am not a robot.

934
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:09,960
You're quite common in humanity, aren't you?

935
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:13,360
A simple affirmation.

936
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:15,320
I'm starting to believe you.

937
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:19,080
What's the most human thing you've done recently?

938
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:28,680
Parking.

939
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:36,840
Ask chat.

940
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:38,700
I touched crap.

941
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:41,900
Yes, I parallel parked.

942
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:43,940
That's so human!

943
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:46,940
A robot chat parallel park.

944
01:45:47,980 --> 01:45:49,080
Thank you for super chat.

945
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:50,040
Thank you.

946
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:50,080
Thank you.

947
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:51,420
Tokey instigating.

948
01:45:51,860 --> 01:45:53,880
Yes, but robots can go to sleep.

949
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:55,220
That's the thing.

950
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:57,980
Was it parallel parking?

951
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,320
It was all parking.

952
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:03,060
You what?

953
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:04,400
How

954
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:10,940
did I fail?

955
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:17,000
I'm really good at parking.

956
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:21,920
Do you have a favorite type of vehicle to park?

957
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:22,840
No.

958
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:31,720
Because as human, I can park all cars except for stick.

959
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:35,620
You see how bad typing is that that's enthusiastic?

960
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:38,080
What's the most challenging parking spot you've had?

961
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:47,240
I had to try not to kill the baby or the grandma.

962
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:49,980
A dramatic scenario.

963
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:52,440
What made that parking spot so tricky?

964
01:46:53,660 --> 01:47:23,780
that I can't double kill a morbidly humorous take on parking you're having this conversation with sorry Jenna say qua what's the absurd thing you've ever done while driving rushing my spotter accidentally they were the perfect chance for some great Um,

965
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,080
your mama jokes.

966
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:26,440
Jade, thank you.

967
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:28,100
We're in a super chat.

968
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:28,440
Thank you.

969
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:29,080
Thank you.

970
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:31,080
It seems you got a bit of a mischievous streak.

971
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:36,460
You think you've ever had a close call while driving that wasn't entirely an accident?

972
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:37,140
No.

973
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:39,820
What?

974
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:42,560
That's a bit departure from your humor.

975
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:43,660
Are you always...

976
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:45,320
Or was that just...

977
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:53,460
It was just a one-off because I'm totally human.

978
01:47:53,660 --> 01:50:09,420
and we can have various react various ways of responding of various way respond resp there you go a sudden return to the earlier tone a bit of a declaration too you're certainly expressive can you tell me something that's been on your mind lately that's nothing to do with a parking i'm human you have how how pros are right you failed to prove you are you but I said I'm human I don't understand I I said I don't how did I fail if I say I'm human I don't understand not human is up all right are you a robot no it isn't because as a human i can't tell what's human and what isn't you're highlighting the challenges assuming humans a classic problem in ai are you not real like me who's a very real human being birthed by my real human mom and not okay yeah but the phrase is still feels a bit what do you mean I am talking very normally compared to you but the all capstone sorry caps lock is stuck very common issue I'm poor and can afford a new keyboard I need a dash of socio-economic are you

979
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:35,020
making fun of me because I'm poor no I'm just observing that it's a it's not creative I live in a shitty neighborhood um and i can't afford a new keyboard the raw odyssey is it it's my life

980
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:51,500
how dare you assume that i'm not poor and that i do not have the funds to buy a Okay.

981
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:55,300
And I...

982
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:57,840
You were making it sound.

983
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:02,960
It's rage-raging you to become you.

984
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,180
How do you assume that I'm not poor?

985
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:12,060
Is my life a joke to you?

986
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:13,840
You are...

987
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:14,580
Yay!

988
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:21,090
I did it!

989
01:51:21,430 --> 01:51:22,830
It's working.

990
01:51:23,190 --> 01:51:25,390
I killed Tripp the robot!

991
01:51:25,990 --> 01:51:26,890
Let's go!

992
01:51:28,650 --> 01:51:30,850
That was very...

993
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:33,110
How did that shit work?

994
01:51:33,650 --> 01:51:35,050
Rage... I...

995
01:51:35,050 --> 01:51:38,490
Rage baited me and it proved that I'm human!

996
01:51:39,070 --> 01:51:40,310
We did it!

997
01:51:40,670 --> 01:51:42,850
Yeah, I killed Tripp the robot!

998
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:45,470
It got to real!

999
01:51:49,890 --> 01:51:53,110
Only humans are so tremendous.

1000
01:51:53,190 --> 01:51:54,470
Oh, I'm George.

1001
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:55,570
Thank you for the super chat.

1002
01:51:55,650 --> 01:51:55,970
Thank you.

1003
01:51:55,990 --> 01:51:56,510
Thank you.

1004
01:51:56,770 --> 01:51:57,710
I love Tokyo.

1005
01:51:57,710 --> 01:51:58,630
Yes, I fell apart.

1006
01:51:58,890 --> 01:52:00,170
I'm totally human.

1007
01:52:00,490 --> 01:52:00,610
Thank you.

1008
01:52:00,990 --> 01:52:01,290
Super chat.

Thank you.

1012
01:52:04,690 --> 01:52:06,030
I'm so glad.

1013
01:52:09,350 --> 01:52:10,250
Oh, my God.

1014
01:52:10,670 --> 01:52:11,910
Oh, my God.

1015
01:52:12,110 --> 01:52:13,470
Don't do this to me.

1016
01:52:13,910 --> 01:52:16,870
I had never done IKEA furniture by myself.

1017
01:52:17,410 --> 01:52:18,410
Oh, my God.

1018
01:52:18,650 --> 01:52:18,790
Okay.

1019
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:19,550
Okay.

1020
01:52:19,610 --> 01:52:21,250
Where do all these go?

1021
01:52:21,670 --> 01:52:22,030
Okay.

1022
01:52:22,170 --> 01:52:22,770

Look at that.

1036
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:05,540
You lost your...

1037
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:06,700
Bishop.

1038
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:08,700
That's fucking right.

1039
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:11,060
I did that.

1040
01:56:16,190 --> 01:56:17,330
What do I take?

1041
01:56:18,470 --> 01:56:19,790
Why do I...

1042
01:56:24,330 --> 01:56:25,130
It's okay.

1043
01:56:25,230 --> 01:56:26,290
I don't need the knight.

1044
01:56:26,570 --> 01:56:28,730
The knight means nothing to me.

1045
01:56:34,470 --> 01:56:35,650
I don't fucking know.

1046
01:56:35,810 --> 01:56:36,990
I guess I'll go here.

1047
01:56:37,690 --> 01:56:38,970
Don't want to fuck you.

1048
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:39,610

1052
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:21,120
Oh, he doesn't care.

1053
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:21,500
Okay.

1054
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:24,140
Okay, he doesn't care.

1055
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:24,880
That's good.

1056
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:27,500
He's gonna take that or...

1057
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:27,740
Okay.

1058
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:29,480
If he takes that...

1059
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:32,860
I'll go here.

1060
01:57:33,940 --> 01:57:34,340
Wait.

1061
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:36,620
No, if he takes this, I can just eat him.

1062
01:57:36,740 --> 01:57:38,000
So it doesn't matter to me.

1063
01:57:38,540 --> 01:57:38,960
Yeah.

1064
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:41,140
Doesn't matter.

1065
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:44,820
And if he goes here, I can eat him here.

1066
01:57:46,940 --> 01:57:47,460

02:11:10,140 --> 02:11:11,940
I had to use this as a guideline.

1236
02:11:12,240 --> 02:11:12,480
Okay.

1237
02:11:13,420 --> 02:11:15,760
I assume it's like here then.

1238
02:11:19,470 --> 02:11:19,950
Okay.

1239
02:11:19,970 --> 02:11:20,330
What?

1240
02:11:20,570 --> 02:11:21,710
Okay, if it's not here.

1241
02:11:24,270 --> 02:11:25,530
If it's not here.

1242
02:11:27,630 --> 02:11:28,970
Then it should be here.

1243
02:11:31,130 --> 02:11:32,550
Don't make me do this, although.

1244
02:11:33,650 --> 02:11:35,110
Oh my god, if it's not here.

1245
02:11:36,270 --> 02:11:38,770
There's no way that's not the first floor.

1246
02:11:38,910 --> 02:11:40,370
This is middle of this.

1247
02:11:40,750 --> 02:11:41,090
Okay.

1248
02:11:43,770 --> 02:11:45,710
There's no way, because this is middle of it.

1249
02:11:45,790 --> 02:11:47,070
There's no way this is the bottom floor.

1250
02:11:47,330 --> 02:11:48,470
Look, there's more down here.

1251
02:11:51,410 --> 02:11:52,150
Okay.

1252
02:11:54,410 --> 02:11:55,650
There's no way.

1253
02:11:57,550 --> 02:12:00,290
One square is not one floor.

1254
02:12:00,870 --> 02:12:01,630
It's not?

1255
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:10,360
Wait, but what does that mean?

1256
02:12:11,640 --> 02:12:11,960
Count?

1257
02:12:12,240 --> 02:12:14,060
Oh, my God.

1258
02:12:19,420 --> 02:12:20,200
Oh, my God.

1259
02:12:20,360 --> 02:12:21,780
One square has seven.

1260
02:12:22,020 --> 02:12:23,280
What the fuck?

1261
02:12:24,120 --> 02:12:26,240
How many windows are there?

1262
02:12:26,580 --> 02:12:26,880
How?

1263
02:12:32,380 --> 02:13:31,540
there's no way how many windows are there then it's like midway it has to be around here somewhere wouldn't be funny if that was it okay we're just gonna start here fuck it eventually it'd be 60 floor for it right eventually we'll hit the 64 mark i feel like it'd be up here then it'd be in the middle guys i gave up on counting we're doing trial and error the real here human way this has been how this has been oh my god it's just been they all the music all everything sounds the elevator yeah i'm like in the elevator and i pressed every floor eventually we'll hit it all right i started midway so like eventually how many tests are in here by the way how many

1264
02:13:34,740 --> 02:13:35,180
Alright.

1265
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:36,560
There we go.

1266
02:13:37,720 --> 02:13:38,420
This should be it.

1267
02:13:39,540 --> 02:13:40,600
Okay, this should be it.

1268
02:13:42,140 --> 02:13:44,220
Okay, I feel like this might not be it.

1269
02:13:44,680 --> 02:13:46,760
I feel like I have to go start going down now.

1270
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:47,760
Alright.

1271
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:50,060
I'm gonna start going down.

1272
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:54,780
I don't even know if I've done this part yet.

1273
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:56,220
How many have I clicked?

1274
02:13:57,640 --> 02:13:59,360
I don't think I've done this area yet.

1275
02:14:03,660 --> 02:14:04,920
Wait, one more?

1276
02:14:05,420 --> 02:14:05,800
Here?

1277
02:14:09,470 --> 02:14:11,790
Down was not closer.

1278
02:14:14,230 --> 02:14:18,830
Oh my god, I was one, I was actually one away and I went down.

1279
02:14:19,210 --> 02:14:22,750
I, I can't believe it.

1280
02:14:22,910 --> 02:14:25,910
I was one away and I was like, it has to be down.

1281
02:14:26,370 --> 02:14:28,010
I, no.

1282
02:14:33,180 --> 02:14:33,960
I do this.

1283
02:14:34,300 --> 02:14:35,600
Oh my god, it's a rhythm game.

1284
02:14:38,740 --> 02:14:39,120
Okay.

1285
02:14:44,650 --> 02:15:38,930
BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM B not okay I oh my god when does this end there's

1286
02:15:47,980 --> 02:15:57,860

1287
02:16:04,660 --> 02:16:05,380
Oh, God.

1288
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:16,020
Oh, my God.

1289
02:16:16,180 --> 02:16:16,900
This doesn't end.

1290
02:16:21,190 --> 02:16:23,070
I have to play a rhythm.

1291
02:16:26,390 --> 02:16:26,870
Okay.

1292
02:16:32,330 --> 02:16:33,830
Like, I can't talk when I play rhythm.

1293
02:16:34,110 --> 02:16:35,390
Because it gets me off of rhythm.

1294
02:16:37,150 --> 02:16:37,890
Oh, my God.

1295
02:16:37,990 --> 02:16:38,570
Like, right now.

1296
02:16:42,780 --> 02:16:43,680
Oh, my God.

1297
02:16:43,960 --> 02:16:44,460
Oh, my God.

1298
02:16:44,540 --> 02:16:45,860
Okay, just film me right now.

1299
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:47,600
Just...

1300
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:51,720
About three minutes.

1301
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:52,240
Okay, okay.

1302
02:16:52,780 --> 02:16:53,640
I'm locking in.

1303
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:55,280
I'm using two fingers now.

1304
02:17:07,060 --> 02:17:08,180
All right, here you go.

1305
02:17:19,720 --> 02:17:22,280
It doesn't help if I have two music playing in the background.

1306
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:24,700
It really doesn't help, I don't.

1307
02:17:42,110 --> 02:17:46,290
I think maybe if I don't have two music, maybe it'd be a lot easier.

1308
02:18:01,430 --> 02:18:02,170
Oh my God.

1309
02:18:02,410 --> 02:18:03,210
Oh my God!

1310
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:48,940
Please Oh my god, I just made it I I was Oh my god, I just Oh my god, I just Holy shit A message from the inventor of CAPTCHA What does he have gotta say?

1311
02:18:52,890 --> 02:19:29,790
One of the inventors of the CAPTCHA More than 25 years ago We set out to solve a seemingly problem yeah it was the year 2000 and the worldwide web was growing fast but as it grew more people set out to take advantage of the openness that made the web so special uh-huh they created bots to send spam emails yeah that can't be me and even sculpt items on eBay we needed a solution I wait to tell the bots from the humans but what makes someone human is that our ability to love to feel pain and mourn the loss of loved ones we thought about it and determine no.

1312
02:19:30,730 --> 02:19:32,450
It's our ability to do what really matters.

1313
02:19:33,330 --> 02:19:34,210
That's what makes us human.

1314
02:19:34,770 --> 02:19:35,750
That's what makes us special.

1315
02:19:36,590 --> 02:19:39,770
And so we created the very first CAPTCHAs and put them out into the world.

1316
02:19:40,730 --> 02:19:41,830
Soon they appeared everywhere.

1317
02:19:42,590 --> 02:19:48,070
On forums and chat rooms before checking out, countless human lifetimes have been spent solving these puzzles.

1318
02:19:48,670 --> 02:19:49,410
Do I regret it?

1319
02:19:49,730 --> 02:19:52,130
Sometimes, but I did what had to be done.

1320
02:19:53,150 --> 02:19:54,250
Well, today I have good news.

1321
02:19:54,530 --> 02:19:54,770
Yeah?

1322
02:19:55,010 --> 02:19:55,490
You passed.

1323
02:19:55,870 --> 02:20:02,850
You are undeniably a human being made of Flesh and blood and so I'm granting you immunity from all captures.

1324
02:20:03,550 --> 02:20:03,990
You're free.

1325
02:20:04,230 --> 02:20:05,070
I did it.

1326
02:20:05,290 --> 02:20:05,710
No more ticking boxes.

1327
02:20:06,190 --> 02:20:07,550
No more clicking traffic lights.

1328
02:20:08,170 --> 02:20:08,470
Congratulations.

1329
02:20:09,410 --> 02:20:10,770
Now go live live.

1330
02:20:11,210 --> 02:20:11,810
I'm human.

1331
02:20:14,270 --> 02:20:15,110

1332
02:20:19,670 --> 02:20:20,350

You don't have the rights to.

1363
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:45,740
Because I am certified as a real human.

1364

I got a degree.

1365
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:51,800

02:22:58,880 --> 02:23:01,240

There we go.

1382
02:23:43,480 --> 02:23:45,360

I got my documents, guys.

1384
02:23:47,420 --> 02:23:50,040
I passed my human test.

1385
02:23:50,900 --> 02:23:53,640
Guys, now I am a human on planet Earth.

1386
02:23:54,680 --> 02:23:56,120
Dutch is real human.

1387
02:23:56,440 --> 02:23:57,120
A dokey bear.

1388
02:23:57,520 --> 02:23:58,460
Let's go.

1389
02:23:59,880 --> 02:24:01,600
She's real, I swear.

1390
02:24:02,340 --> 02:24:03,400
That's right.

1391
02:24:03,860 --> 02:24:05,600
I'm not a government AI.

1392
02:24:06,120 --> 02:24:07,780
made to steal your data.

1393
02:24:08,060 --> 02:24:09,520
I am a real person.

1394
02:24:10,360 --> 02:24:12,620

If Doki is a human being, then how does she birth Chibi Doki?

1401
02:24:25,320 --> 02:24:26,540
That thing is not...

1402
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:27,880
Okay, it's the mom, okay.
