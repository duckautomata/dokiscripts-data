1
00:03:38,170 --> 00:05:05,290
hello everybody hello hello so i needed time a little bit of time to set up everything i feel like ever since i took that was a two-week break i forgot what how to stream and how to talk oh my god my mind feels so slow i forgot how to talk these days um but yes dad is back uh for those who don't know um he came back i believe two days ago um i actually forgot what when i picked him up like time has blurred together like everything has merged together for me so i think it was two days ago i don't even remember um but he is back now he is incredibly chunky now um so for those who don't follow me on twitter which is understandable because you don't have a twitter anymore uh which is also very understandable um let me grab a picture i day being back um so he's dead he is he's back now um sadly he has to go on a diet because he is very chunky right now because of his medication um he was on uh steroids uh for like three weeks because of you know like the the joint pain so the vet put him on

2
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:59,790
steroids uh because of that he got chunky uh so he is a lot wider now um he's a lot thicker too uh so this is the look he gave me when i was like you're gonna have to go on a diet and he's like no or maybe he's thinking about her um he's thinking about the dog sitter um um but yeah when the dog sitter gave me back dad um when she got in her car he tried to chase after her he was like no don't leave he's like wait why are you leaving no so yeah that hurt my ego a little bit yeah that hurt my that hurt my self-esteem like he didn't care that he's coming back to me he was like look he's like come back no he's like no don't

3
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:35,530
that hurt my ego a little you know um no no no no no no no no weiner dogs cannot be extra thick because their their backs are way too long that they just don't have enough support if they get too fat so and and they have very short legs so like it hurts their but it's the thing is it like um it's not really good for them because they have such short legs so the extra weight puts strain on their joints and everything.

4
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,310
And I don't want him to get arthritis.

5
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,050
You know, he's already, I already have to treat him like a senior dog.

6
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,830
So I don't want him to get even more senior dog treatment.

7
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,830
So I don't want him to get arthritis.

8
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,510
So yeah, that's why I have to, I'm not giving him any treats or anything.

9
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,390
I'm just feeding him his usual meals.

10
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,670
And then other than that, he has been treatless for the last two days.

11
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,110
Maybe that's why he misses very so much.

12
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:34,510
um he's been very very weird um i don't know i don't know what's on his mind so like one time like i think this was yesterday um i was like using the bathroom and i forgot to close the door because i live by myself who the fuck is gonna be like you know whoa like watch me so unless there's ghosts but like so i forgot to close my door when i was using the bathroom because i was I got it.

13
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,090
I really got to use the bathroom.

14
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,870
And then so then dad like walk like was and I gave I gave him a toy.

15
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,470
Um, I gave him a toy, uh, earlier.

16
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,890
And then he like, I was, I was using the bathroom and then he like walked past.

17
00:07:50,390 --> 00:08:24,490
He walks past my bathroom with the toy, then walks back to the opening drops the toy and then walks away and i i don't know what he's trying to say like i i was i was so confused because i was like why so so he was like so like he just drops and then i took a picture after i was done because i was like why were you doing what why did you do that like no And then I like,

18
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,890
I don't know, like, you know, I gave the toy back to him and he didn't care.

19
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,670
He was just like, I'm sleeping.

20
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,450
What are you doing?

21
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,350
He didn't even look at me.

22
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,470
He didn't even look at me.

23
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:47,070
He just walks past the door, drops the toy, and then walks back to his bed.

24
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,050
And he didn't even look at me.

25
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,930
I was so fucking confused.

26
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,710
I was like, I was like, do you want to?

27
00:08:53,790 --> 00:10:19,690
play and then I brought the toy back to him and he didn't care he was just he's like what are you doing like he's trying to send a message I was like oh dude why did you do this also I have a series of pictures that pictures that need to show you guys it's like a little adventure so um this morning when I woke up um when i woke up i received a giant ass package like it was like as almost as tall as me and i was so confused because you know i woke up in the morning i was like okay it's walkies time and then like um um i opened the door dad went out first and then you know i was really tired and groggy and then like I try to get out and then there was a giant ass fucking box in front of me and I was so confused I was like what what what is this I was like in the morning too because usually my packages don't get delivered in the morning it's usually like in the afternoon slash like midday where I receive packages so I was like what's this doing here like who sent this to me and to give

28
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:48,390
like a visual of how big this package is um um I have a size comparison and of like dad and like I try to use my nendroid not my sorry my good smile plushie as a comparison but then he was yeah it was called fat boy too so I was like what the fuck is this was how big the package was I was so confused I was like what is this

29
00:10:52,630 --> 00:11:04,190
Before I, like, tell you, like, I need to show you guys a series of, because I was trying to do a, I was trying to do a photo shoot with the plushie, and look at...

30
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,260
It's like a little, it's like a little story.

31
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,720
It's like a little story right now.

32
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,720
All right, here's picture three.

33
00:11:25,060 --> 00:13:13,340
He knows it's worth it And then And then And then picture Picture 4 And then And then And then it's gone And then it's gone A story in five parts I was trying to do I was trying to do a fucking photo shoot And he just comes in and was like Goodbye Yoink my my plushy now so this is where it started where it started and where it no it survived i got it um i got it back so i obviously i was incredibly confused because i was like what the fuck is what is this fat boy package is this fat boy package for my fat boy for me so and then i looked and it was just it was just stuffing pellets and i was so fucking confused because i was like this is just stuffing i i was like what what is this is it's literally it's literally just stuffing i'm like where did this come from so apparently okay i found out um where it came from and apparently yeah it was yeah so it was a package in two parts so they they sent me the um they sent me the stuffing pellets before i actually got the item and i didn't know

34
00:13:13,340 --> 00:14:26,900
this was the item because they were like oh it's a surprise so i was like and like and there were like issues with like it arriving to me in Canada because of tariffs and customs so because it came from the states so I was so confused because I was like why do I have a two feet tall box filled with pellets like filled with pellet stuffings like what is this doing here in front of my door um so apparently for those who don't know like who don't follow the um um the apex community anymore um uh the apex devs sent me a the newest i don't know what season they're in right now it's it's been so many seasons i've lost count um but they sent a bunch of creators um a package to to celebrate the newest season and in the package was apparently a giant a giant ass nessie beanbag um for you to sit on So that package didn't arrive to me because Customs was like,

35
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,560
what the fuck is this?

36
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,080
They've yanked it and like jailed the package because they're like, you gotta pay fees for this.

37
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,520
So there was, you know, it was literally just a cover.

38
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:43,700
I don't know.

39
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,920
I think it was, they were supposed to come in two sets too.

40
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:54,800
Yeah, yeah, they took the Nessie package, but I don't know about, I don't know if they took, I think they didn't take the pellets.

41
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:10,900
I think they literally just, um, literally just said the pellets were safe, but not the package, because like, customs didn't, because there was no, like, custom sticker, like, you know, when it was, when you get your package for the Canadians out there,

42
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:24,140
for those who aren't Canadian, I don't know what the American system is like, but if your package gets marked by customs, um, There's, like, giant stickers on your package that's, like, inspected by customs, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

43
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:33,300
So, like, I would always get, like, these giant red stickers where they're, like, inspected by customs if it got, like, if it got, like, marked by them.

44
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:41,460
And so, but the beanbag pellets, the giant-ass pellet box did not get inspected by customs, because they're, like, I don't know.

45
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,100
They're like, who would fucking hide a gun in some pellets, I guess.

46
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:56,800
So, so because of that, um, they shipped back my Apex package back to the States.

47
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:11,080
Um, they're working on, uh, they're working on like trying to get it back to me, um, because like they weren't able to, they didn't pay the, um, because I was on vacation slash on my business trip in China, uh, when all of this was happening.

48
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,580
So they didn't realize that they had, um, it got inspected by customs and then they had to pay like fees and stuff.

49
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,280
Oh, it got sent back because we didn't realize we had to pay the fees.

50
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,180
So, so I have pellets, but I don't have the bean bag.

51
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,860
I, yeah, I got boxed, but they're sending it back to me.

52
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,600
So, so that's good at least, you know, that's good.

53
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:44,580
Yeah, so I was just like, what the fuck is this fat boy box in my, outside my door?

54
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,540
Dad's back?

55
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,080
Oh, yeah.

56
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:59,220
Also, I forgot to say, when Dad, like, dropped the plushie at my door, it was 4 in the morning.

57
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,440
He literally was doing a 4 a.m.

58
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,260
drive-by through my door, dropped the plushie, and then walked away.

59
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,380
Fucking weird-ass dog.

60
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:12,940
But, yeah.

61
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,980
Today, we are going to be playing Epic Mickey.

62
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:24,880
It's been a while since the last Epic, I think it was like, what, three weeks since the last time I played Epic Mickey?

63
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,040
I gotta stop doing this.

64
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,360
I gotta stop, like, revisiting games after, like, two to three weeks.

65
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,740
I need to stop doing that.

66
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,440
I need to finish my games in a good, in, like, a faster manner.

67
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:46,280
But it has been a while, so I hope we all remember what was going on in Epic Mickey.

68
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,700
Oh, my God.

69
00:17:47,700 --> 00:18:19,930
my brain feels like i i feel like a new streamer because my brain feels so slow like i feel like i'm like trying to like remember how to talk it but it has been a while um oh yeah by the way fun fact uh this showed up on my this showed up on my twitter feed and i thought it was so i was i did not realize this was a thing but did you guys this is a very fun fact time.

70
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:29,190
Did you guys know that drinking Coca-Cola lowers the sperm count?

71
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:42,680
Apparently studies have shown that there is a link between male infertility and drinking Coca-Cola.

72
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,060
Oh my god.

73
00:18:48,380 --> 00:19:57,680
I mean, I mean, cheaper than getting a vasectomy and you get to drink soda you get to drink you get to drink coca-cola like wait I just like wait is this the ad chat at grok is this true okay wait uh okay and then i okay okay the funnier okay but that's not over the here's where it gets even funny okay um because i was like wait there's no way that's true um but anyway it's not over so i told this fun fact to some friends and um one of them was like oh yeah when i

74
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:19,980
one of my friends was like yo because it showed up on my twitter feed and i was like wait is this true but instead of going like at grok um instead of going at grok i went to google like uh like an old

75
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:33,880
So, I told one of my friends, well, I told multiple people, but I told, I thought it was a very fun fact.

76
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:40,480
So, one of my friends who I told was like, yeah, I know this.

77
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,580
I found out during LAN, and I was like, wait, how?

78
00:20:45,680 --> 00:21:02,440
Apparently, apparently, the Chinese staff at the LAN, At the LAT, we're telling people not to drink coke because it lowers the sperm count.

79
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,280
They're like, no, it's not good for you.

80
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,700
Don't drink it.

81
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,320
I'm like, why would the staff be telling people that?

82
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,580
Like, why?

83
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,620
That's...

84
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:23,220
Matt was looking out for the good guy staff to protect the next generation of...

85
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,040
gamers.

86
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,320
Yeah, I was like, why wait, why at length?

87
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,640
Because at least they care.

88
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:45,440
Yeah, so like the, the staff, there was a staff, apparently there was a staff member that were telling the players not to drink Coca-Cola.

89
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,700
Because they were like, don't drink Coca-Cola.

90
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,860
It raises infertility.

91
00:21:53,240 --> 00:22:10,300
players are like what the and then and then a bunch of them started like chugging it down even more because they're like we're not trying to get anyone pregnant so i know i was like

92
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:55,520
um so yeah that's what i thought that was a really fun fact guys that that's the game right there that's i thought that was a i thought that was a fun fact guys uh i don't i i did not realize that that was a thing until recent until twitter thank you twitter uh yeah that's what i expected would happen um all right let's play epic what a great fact uh what a great fun fact to drop before playing a disney game guys um it is It's a fun fact.

93
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:05,890
Alright.

94
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,030

Let me figure out what volume I need to put this on.

96
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,350

00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,270
Yeah, it's cheaper than paying for college, guys.

For a kid's college fun.

Has next one...

141
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,860
And the next one belongs to animatronic Captain Hook.

142
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,980
What the fuck?

143
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,460
What the fuck?

144
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,780
I don't even remember this.

145
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,620
Alright.

146
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,080
Can I run here?

147
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,060
Okay, I can run.

148
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:23,520
Alright.

149
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,520
Oh, I had nine.

150
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,280
That's why.

151
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,640
Yeah, I drank way too much Coca-Cola, guys.

152
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,360
Okay.

153
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,940
That didn't take you long to get her out.

154
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,780
Now I can get this projector screen to Venture Land functioning again.

155
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,760
Next scene, thank you for the super chat, thank you.

156
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,440
Let's see, I'll just put this here.

157
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,760
Turn that screw.

158
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,140
And presto!

159
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,260
The projector screen to Venture Land should be up and running now.

160
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,960
Now I get to work on the last projector screen.

161
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,960
It might take a while.

162
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,000
Take care, Mickey.

163
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,200
Alright, there you go, Adventure Lab.

164
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,440
Oh, it's Jungle Rhythm!

165
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,800
Oh, am I gonna go to the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Club?

166
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,000
In the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Club.

167
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,700
In the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Club.

168
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,600
In the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Club.

169
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,080
Where's the room?

170
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,620
In the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki.

171
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,880
Oh, shit, I sang the...

172
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,680
It's the wrong lyrics.

173
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,640
In the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tami.

174
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,800
In the tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki room.

175
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,000
I knew I forgot, like...

176
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,800
Look, it's been a while, okay?

177
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,600
It's been a while since I've listened to that song.

178
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,220
Because you can only hear this song in the tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki.

179
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:51,980
Tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki.

180
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,880
All right.

181
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,660
Oh my gosh, whoops.

182
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,500
God damn it.

183
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,220
How do I...

184
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,560
Okay.

185
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
extra jump thing.

186
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,000
There we go.

187
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,620
It's literally the song you can only listen to it in that one place.

188
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,160
The Tiki room.

189
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:14,820
Really?

190
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,940
No, they didn't remove it.

191
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,580
They just added like they renovated it.

192
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,280
I heard they renovated it because I know like they added Iago into the Tiki.

193
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,440
They did like a they like what's the word called revamped?

194
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,900
No.

195
00:28:29,200 --> 00:29:20,980

Okay, I break it.

199
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,810
Oh, what's this?

200
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,310
Oh, it could be like a secret?

201
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,370
I love secrets.

202
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,310
Okay.

203
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,810
Oh, hey, there's a painting over here.

204
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,330
Can I make this?

205
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,050
No!

206
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,410
Okay, it's fine.

207
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,710
Wait, where is he crying?

208
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,470
Oh, there he is.

209
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,330
Oh, sorry.

210
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,830
You're fine.

211
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,050
Sorry, Shmi.

212
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,350
But you're used to it, right?

213
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:38,970
You basically have, like, a little, you know, a little thing with Captain Hook.

214
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,190
I know you like this.

215
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,350
Didn't they make Shmi gay?

216
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,330
No, it wasn't Shmi.

217
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,870
It was Lafou.

218
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,570
They made Lafou gay for Gaston.

219
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,210
I mean, look at him.

220
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,750
Look at Gaston, though.

221
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,550
Well, only had...

222
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,990
man, I guess you'd say.

223
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,550
I was, so the captain chased us out of Tartuga.

224
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,330
What happened?

225
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,890
We had to escape, we did.

226
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,130
The captain was hauling us to Skull Island.

227
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,490
It's where we pirates used to live there.

228
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,910
But we get no more.

229
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,130
Not since that machine started turning us into monsters.

230
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,410
Oh my god, what?

231
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,850
You get to be a mecha?

232
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,790
You get to be a fucking cyborg?

233
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,130
How?

234
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,310
What's the negative here?

235
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,270
What's the con here?

236
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,710
My crew turn to idle and mistreat.

237
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,350
My crew once so, shape, ship, now so, so.

238
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,930
Bro, yeah, that's fucking awesome.

239
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,570
Yeah, where's the downside?

240
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,990
There'll be no match for him.

241
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,070
What do you mean?

242
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,950
You're fucking cyborgs.

243
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,970
If only someone could stop him.

244
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,550
We should go to Scarlet and see that machine.

245
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:02,430
Then Smya and his crew can go home.

246
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:06,170
Trouble is, the way there is blocked.

247
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,090
Can you help us?

248
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,090
Captain Hook, I mean that awful machine hook.

249
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,570
Chase is clear out of Tortuga.

250
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,710
You'll stop him.

251
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,030
Well, first you have to get to him.

252
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:23,210
And to do that, you'll need to fix the door opening contraption we broke.

253
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,090
You'll need a ship's wheel.

254
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,550
Not long back, my crew sold one to T.

255
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,350
Slam.

256
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,010
Oh, Damien Salt, the big one who's on Lustruck.

257
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,750
He's got the figurehead.

258
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:40,930
Scurvy Pat, the sneaky-eyed fella by the mask, he did not have the compass.

259
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,850
Isn't Tortuga like Pirates of the Caribbean?

260
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,490
Did Captain shoot these items?

261
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,690
Bring him to me.

262
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,030
That way I can repair the contraption.

263
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:57,030
Get all the items back and he can pass through to Tortuga.

264
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,550
Yeah, I was gonna say, isn't that positive?

265
00:32:59,570 --> 00:34:28,150

266
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,110
Hello, Daisy.

267
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,370
Another one?

268
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,330
And it's Daisy.

269
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,230
Oh, Mickey goodness.

270
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,730
How did you wind up here?

271
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,930
I'm afraid I'm not looking my best today.

272
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,710
The mad doctor.

273
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,410
We're positively beastly.

274
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:47,010
Don't worry.

275
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,130
I'll take a look for the rest of you, Daisy.

276
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:50,850
Where are you?

277
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:51,930
You know what I mean.

278
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:56,950

Alright, we have bring back all of them.

281
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,050
What the fuck is here?

282
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,530
Oh, I was gonna say, where are his pupils?

283
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:37,010
Who interrupts Hellsman Antonio's meditation?

284
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,090
Hello, Mickey Mouse.

285
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,090
Did you see me levitating just now?

286
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:45,450
I am learning to expand my cartoon abilities.

287
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,170
Blackfire, thank you for the five gifted chips.

288
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,230
Thank you, thank you.

289
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,050

00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:57,290
I'm bosom Blake and most pleased to meet you.

292
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:01,190
I've been here too long, losing my sea legs, you know?

293
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,630
We pilots are refugees here.

294
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:06,090
Speak with me to hear the sad tale.

295
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,010
Wait, how do I...

296
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:09,830
Let's see.

297
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,850
Oh, I have to go all the way there.

298
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,330

It's my one sixth birthday and a one sixth and a few minutes birthday.

304
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,990
Can I get one sixth and a few minutes happy birthday?

305
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,510
Well, happy birthday song is like two minutes.

00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,450
So you get like two seconds of a happy birthday song.

307
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:05,890
Happy.

308
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,050

Thank you, thank you.

310
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,590
My name is Damien Saw.

311
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,430
Hey, you seem like a worldly sort.

312
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,070
I don't suppose you know what the woman went.

313
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:16,810
Ice cream?

314
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:17,510
Lowers?

315
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:18,390
Coca-Cola?

316
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:19,970
Lowers?

317
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:44,690
are hard to get here in wasteland but ice cream that would be easy i'm too shy to ask her myself but with the right gift i know i can win her over yes i have a fingerhead but i can't part with it it looks like my sweet henriela it reminds me of her but if henriela were mine i'd give you the Figure it out happily.

318
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,530
There's only...

319
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,530
That only way to really know what she would want is to ask her.

320
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,470
She can be temperamental.

321
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,430
And the wrong gift will surely earn her scorn.

322
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,450
Do you want to give Damien the ice cream?

323
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:06,190
I don't even know what Henrietta likes.

324
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,190
I don't know her.

325
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,070
Do I give her...

326
00:38:13,090 --> 00:39:04,190
I don't know her like I just I just talked to her like five seconds ago she literally was like there's a stalker she literally told me there's a stalker okay there's Henrietta I just love the outdoors fresh air tree plants the scent of a okay away from that ice cream parlor all you guys kept bringing me trying to win heart i'll tell you a secret i'm actually lactose intolerant and i can drink milk and i'm a cow okay see that's all you have to do talk to women okay it's not that hard okay it's pretty difficult okay it is pretty difficult to talk to women as a fellow woman i'm also scared

327
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,930
Don't worry.

328
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,090
I'm also very scared.

329
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,410
It's very difficult.

330
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,070
Good thing they're not real.

331
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,750
Alright.

332
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,070
Let's go this way.

333
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,520
Alright.

334
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,820
We go this way.

335
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,080
And oh, there's an ITK mask!

336
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:43,580
Yay!

337
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,960
I was like, what do I do from here, though?

338
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,200
Pac-cor!

339
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,380
Pac-cor!

340
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,120
You know what?

341
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,020
You say I could do an endurance stream and finish epic Mickey's?

342
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,680
I mean, I feel like I could.

343
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,280
You know what, let's try and do an endurance stream and finish epic Mickey's.

344
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,180
All right, all right, guys, we're in for the long haul.

345
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,880
I don't know where to go, which isn't very helpful for an endurance stream.

346
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:15,680
All right.

347
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,640
It's not very helpful, but, like, I think I can do it.

348
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,060
Give women ice cream she eats for a day.

349
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,700
Teach a woman to ice cream she eats forever.

350
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,020
Bruh, thank you for this super chat.

351
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,060
Thank you, thank you.

352
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,640
I don't know what to do.

353
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,640
Leather has been eyeing a treehouse.

354
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:46,420
He's been waiting since that block, Antonio, by the ranch, poor Slav, since losing my eye.

355
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,280
Alright.

356
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,520
Where the fuck do I go?

357
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,780
I feel like I talk to everybody.

358
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:57,100
They're like, we need flowers, but like, where the fuck do I get flowers?

359
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:58,840
Oh.

360
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,400
I can come in here.

361
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,060
Oh!

362
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,500
Oh my god, that's the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki room!

363
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,560
Welcome to the Tiki Hut.

364
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,580
I'm Tiki Santa, Tiki Connoisseur.

365
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,620
Where it has it?

366
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,920
You come for a ship's wheel, hmm?

367
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,500
Yeah, I got one from the same pirates that loot my Tiki collection.

368
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,460
In my Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki room.

369
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,860
The finest trio of Tiki masks you've ever seen.

370
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,200
Now scattered to their wind.

371
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,520
Oh, I got it.

372
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,920
I just got it.

373
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:30,940
Yay!

374
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,500
Here's your Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki mask.

375
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,500
Here's the ship's wheel.

376
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,340
you later.

377
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,360
Oh, like what?

378
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,500
What is this?

379
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,240
Restores all of his health.

380
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:44,780
Oh, okay.

381
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,740
No, I don't need it.

382
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,240
Alright, here we go.

383
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:09,440
That song is so good, honestly.

384
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,180
Oh wait, I just came back from the room.

385
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,980
Sorry, I just love the Tiki room so much.

386
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,360
Alright, here's the wheel, Shmi.

387
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,400
Uh.

388
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,440
I forgot what did he want?

389
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,540
He wanted...

390
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,800
What did the compass guy want again?

391
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,900
Oh, 20... Okay, yeah, sure.

392
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,960
I can bribe you.

393
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,620

394
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,960
You're so stupid.

395
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,600
That's like 25 cents in the Mickey world.

396
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,080

00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,980
I literally don't see any flowers.

401
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,120

00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,420

I don't understand.

409
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,900
There's no flowers.

410
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,780
I can't believe there's no fucking flower in the jungle.

411
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,760
It's a goddamn jungle.

412
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,200
Like, this is literally a flower.

413
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,420
You want, she wants a full bouquet, too.

422
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,180
Lolly, thank you for the super chat.

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:50,740
Thank you.

00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,740
Thank you.

425
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,740
Hi, Toki.

426
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,300
Glad you survived the black rain volcano.

427
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,760
My birthday was a couple weeks ago.

428
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:57,740
While you're on a trip.

429
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:58,840
Can I have a happy birthday?

430
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,140
Of course you can, Lolly.

431
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,180
Happy birthday to you.

432
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,200
Happy birthday to you.

433
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,340
Happy birthday, dear Lolly.

434
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,400
Happy birthday to you.

435
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,060
Yeah, happy birthday.

436
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,240
I didn't know.

437
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,220
I was like.

438
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,720
If I just water it, like, because I'm like, every plants need water.

439
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:24,080
And so I just watered the cactus every day, and then it drowned.

440
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,840
I was like, oh, that can happen?

441
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,140
I'm like, oh my gosh.

442
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,560
Like, I was like, how is my cactus dying?

443
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,480
You, you, I give you water and the sun.

444
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,300
I don't understand.

445
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:44,320
And then I, and then, and I looked it up, and you can actually drown a cactus, because you're not supposed to water it every day.

446
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,860
How old was I when that happened?

447
00:46:51,740 --> 00:47:01,120
Um, it happened when my parents left their cactus at my place and then like they're like remember to water your plant, water our plants, water our plants.

448
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,140
And I was like, okay.

449
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,540
So then, so then like I watered the plants.

450
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,980
I just did what they told me to do.

451
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,340
I just, I was just listening or I was following orders.

452
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:26,880
I was literally doing what they were telling me where are my fucking book I'm going back home I don't know where to get the goddamn bouquet this area is not even that big like

453
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,880
do you think Daisy will know where flowers are

454
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:47,160
okay no it's just it's all it's just about Donald Donald Donald Donald what about me and my

455
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,820
I was just being a...

456
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,040
I was just trying to listen to orders.

457
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,320
I was told to remember to water my plants or their plants.

458
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,000
And I was like, okay, I'll go water the plants.

459
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,120
They didn't say how many times I had to water them every day.

460
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,560
Or like, how many times I have to water them.

461
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:12,680
Yes, I'm off.

462
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,280
Okay, I fucking...

463
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,360
I swear to God, I'm this close to having...

464
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,220
I'm this close to giving her ice cream.

465
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:18,800
I swear to...

466
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,860
I'm this close to sabotaging this relationship.

467
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,620
I'm so close.

468
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,080
I'm at the edge right now.

469
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,980
No, because that plant isn't real.

470
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:37,240
That's not good enough because she wants fucking roses.

471
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,220
I'm this close to starting her lactose intolerance.

472
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,460
Oh, wait.

473
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,740
Someone looked it up.

474
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,580
Okay, how?

475
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,020
What do we do?

476
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,120
Try it.

477
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:52,920
What do we do?

478
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,350
Ooh, someone looked it up.

479
00:48:58,670 --> 00:48:59,650
Where's the flowers?

480
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:02,230
Where is it?

481
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,310
I need to go to another zone.

482
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:08,310
Then what's the point?

483
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,370
Oh my god, I just spawned a TV.

484
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:12,470
I forgot I had that.

485
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:17,470
I just spawned a TV.

486
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:18,930
I forgot that was a thing.

487
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:29,950

489
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:52,990
I'm so forgetful.

490
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,570
Where Goofy is?

491
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:57,550
Oh my god.

492
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,970
Work all the way to fucking goddamn Toontown?

493
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:01,590
Okay.

494
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,210
That is so much backtrack.

495
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:05,650
How would I remember this?

496
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,350
It's been...

497
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:09,730
I guess like normal people wouldn't wait three weeks to play this game.

498
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:12,130
I meant to play the next part.

499
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:13,750
Is this where Toontown?

500
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:14,730
I don't remember.

501
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:15,830
No, this is Junkyard.

502
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:17,930
Where is the other town?

503
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:22,610
This is...

504
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:25,330
Where did the- where- it was the other town?

505
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:26,770
No, this was the other town.

506
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:29,870
This was the other town.

507
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:31,790
Yeah, sure.

508
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:33,770
It's like $10.

509
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,170
I can afford that.

510
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,460
What's wrong?

511
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,840
If you give a human ice cream made out of human milk?

512
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,780
I mean, you drink human milk as a fucking baby.

513
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,840
Like, what's wrong with that?

514
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:48,420
Okay, there you go.

515
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,400
Let's steal their plants.

516
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,780
Wait, how do I steal it?

517
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,560
How do I steal their plants?

518
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,720
Oh, there we go.

519
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,280
Oh, is that all your parts, Goofy?

520
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,480
Oh, I found all of them!

521
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:11,860
Yay!

522
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,200
Oh, gosh, thanks, Mickey.

523
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,600
Now I can get back to work now.

524
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,020
And boy, could this place use some cleaning.

525
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,360
Yay!

526
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,340
I found Goofy's parts.

527
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,300
Thanks for reconstructing me.

528
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,540
It's great how far I'll be all back together.

529
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:28,880
Oh.

530
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:30,980
Yup.

531
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,600
I can't wait to get back to cleaning this place up.

532
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,840
I'm going to start with Ortenzia's house.

533
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,300
I haven't been there for a while.

534
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,840
And I think I left the door lock.

535
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,060
Thanks again, Mickey.

536
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,260
Oh, nice.

537
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,000
Why is there footsteps?

538
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:48,840
Okay.

539
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:50,660
So.

540
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,580
How do I steal their plants?

541
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,520
I don't get it.

542
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,460
I'm here.

543
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,420
How the fuck do I steal the plants?

544
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,900
What's that over there?

545
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,140
Oh, no, that's...

546
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,040
Wait, what is that over?

547
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:11,800
Why is it glowing?

548
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,540
Why is this glowing?

549
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,880
Oh, is that...

550
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,580
Is that flower?

551
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,360
Oh, am I making the bouquet?

552
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,460
Uh, Fizir, welcome to the tomato farm.

553
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,260
Welcome, welcome.

554
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,420
Wait, what's that is?

555
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,600
Was that part of, like, partial bouquet?

556
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,160
Are we doing it?

557
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:33,940
I don't know.

558
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,280
I'm so...

559
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,440
Oh, it is!

560
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,140
We're making...

561
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,320
We're slowly making the bouquet.

562
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,500
Okay, I see.

563
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,820
Eifen, thank you for the super chat.

564
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,760
Thank you, thank you.

565
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,640
Doki would go platinum for Google.

566
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,260
What the fuck is Google, baby?

567
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,000
Thank you for the super chat.

568
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,300
Eifen, thank you, thank you.

569
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,120
Okay, we're missing one more.

570
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,780
Where the fuck is the last flower?

571
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,000
There's three flowers in total.

572
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,940
How the fuck did children figure this out?

573
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,160
Lolly, thank you for the super chat.

574
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,380
Thank you, thank you.

575
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,340
Okay, it has to be like...

576
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,060
Oh wait, I remember.

577
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,240
It was like...

578
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,720
It's close to wherever the switches are.

579
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,700
Because, like, that was, like, one of the switches, so it should be, like, one of the other, close to the other switch.

580
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,260
Which I don't remember where the last switch was.

581
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:35,960
Oh, it's over there.

582
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,160
Wait, there's no flower there.

583
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:43,110
Isn't the Greg factory?

584
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,410
Isn't that the Greg factory over there?

585
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:47,890
Oh, shit, hey.

586
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:48,570
Free stuff.

587
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:53,290
Or, like, is there another hidden wall here?

588
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:57,210
Oh, there it is.

589
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:58,850
Oh, Ned.

590
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:00,110
I found it.

591
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:01,730
Time to go.

592
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,590
Get my $10 back, too.

593
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:05,370
Alright.

594
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:11,710
Drinking up milk and you can build lactose intolerance, but you will be sick for first weeks.

595
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,330
Generally just a skill issue.

596
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,710
Thank you for the super chat.

597
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:15,850
Thank you.

598
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:16,910
You guys hear that?

599
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,950
You can cure your lactose intolerance.

600
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:20,570
Just keep drinking milk.

601
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,200
Alright.

602
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,960
Gotta go back to give that cow her goddamn flowers.

603
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:55,180
All right.

604
00:54:59,320 --> 00:54:59,800
No.

605
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,960
I got you flowers.

606
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,120
Stop.

607
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:04,840
Okay.

608
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,260
Wait, I got three flowers.

609
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,160
I don't understand.

610
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,240
What?

611
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,770
I need to speak to Clarabelle.

612
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:24,230
Oh, my gosh.

613
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:27,830
How was I supposed to know I have to speak to fucking Clarabelle?

614
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:30,930
Is she, like, the flower master?

615
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:33,870
Like, only Clarabelle can make a bouquet.

616
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:35,530
Like,

617
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:47,930
Only one person can make a bouquet because it's so hard to piece flowers together.

618
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,810
It's the flower gatekeep.

619
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:54,730
Clarabelle owns the monopoly on flowers, apparently.

620
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:57,490
The flower master.

621
00:55:57,930 --> 00:55:59,830
She is the flower bender.

622
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:03,110
There can only be one.

623
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:08,590
Okay, I know Clarabelle was here.

624
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:10,850
That's Clarabelle right there.

625
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:13,370
Oh my god, all the cows look the same.

626
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:15,150
No, that's Amelia.

627
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,270
Wait, which one's Clara Bell?

628
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:21,630
Wait, that's Gilda.

629
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:26,530
Wait, there's so many cows.

630
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:29,470
Which one is the real cow?

631
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:31,930
Oh, wow, Doki.

632
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:33,010
They're all real.

633
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:36,850
Oh my god, she's back in the other town, isn't she?

634
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:40,270
Oh, wow, Doki.

635
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:45,790
All right, you go to the farm right now and tell me if you can tell which cow is which.

636
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:54,770
You go to a farm right now, look at all the cows, turn around, and then look at the cows again.

637
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:57,190
Tell me if you remember which cow is which.

638
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:07,950
Don't, okay, I'm going to, all right, okay, I'm going to pull a video of a cow.

639
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:25,950

642
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:49,230
Oh, she's in a house.

643
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:50,650
What house?

644
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:53,430
What house?

645
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,290
She's in a house.

646
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:59,130
That's so helpful.

647
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:03,130
Are you clear about?

648
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:04,510
No, that's...

649
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:07,190
What are you in the cow?

650
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,730
Which one?

651
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:11,450

00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,490
You need a flower for Henrietta?

655
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:22,830
You're not thinking big enough.

656
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:24,210
You need a bouquet of flowers.

657
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:27,370
Of course, I can't just pick flowers from my prized garden.

658
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:30,430
You have to find a few flowers from Ostown and Meastreet.

659
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:32,310
I will make them a bouquet for you.

660
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:33,450
Three should be enough.

661
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:34,470
Okay, I got it.

662
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:37,290
We already, like, sped running through that.

663
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:41,550
I say as it took me maybe 30 minutes to get past this part.

664
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:47,790

01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:23,840
I had to close down after she stopped going.

671
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,420
All right, where's Detective Horace is?

672
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,940
Here, that's a detective agency.

673
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:35,920
Single-handedly propping up the McDonald's down the street.

674
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,300
Clara was saying to deliver this to me.

675
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,240

01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,380

After all, she baked you a pie and all she got was a pin.

681
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,500
I didn't come here, didn't get a dagger.

682
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:31,460

Oh, goody.

695
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:05,060
Okay, it's like Umamusume.

696
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:11,220
Okay, but the horse girls, they have like a pass because they have the face of a human.

697
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,220
But that's literally a cow.

698
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:14,100
Okay.

699
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:49,280
it's like a reverse mermaid is it wrong if it's a like it's is it wrong if it's a reverse he collected all the parts you know like tors like the legs of a human or wasted legs of a human but the top part is like all fish uh as to start blocking the way to tortuga it's better You can continue your journey,

01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,800
a challenge, captain, hook.

701
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,360
The part that matters is human.

702
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,660
That's true.

703
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,360
Like a normal mermaid.

704
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:06,000
If you think about it.

705
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:09,300
Because you know how, like, you know how mermaids have kids, right?

706
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:12,880
The female just spits, just poops the eggs out.

707
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:16,660
And then the male fish poops the, uh, poops.

708
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:38,160
a baby making juice onto the eggs so technically technically like technically a reverse mermaid would be a better experience than the normal mermaid don't keep please i'm frowning

Got it.

712
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,500
I was not expecting this.

713
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:30,880
Thanks, Toki.

714
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,040

Thank you, thank you.

716
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,720
I agree with that one dragoon.

717
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,680
Give her time out, Toki.

718
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,380
Sure, thank you for the super chat.

719
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:44,180
Thank you, thank you.

720
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,800
They booed her because she's right.

721
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,860
All right, where the fuck do I- oh, it's this way.

722
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:55,480
Okay, I was gonna say, where the fuck is it?

723
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:58,400
Then...

724
01:07:59,100 --> 01:07:59,640
All right.

725
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,060
Oh my god, barely made that one.

726
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,460
No, she isn't.

727
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:14,360
Okay, I was gonna say, why can't I fucking move?

728
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,000
How do I get up there?

729
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,460
Okay, I have to do, like, a whole thing.

730
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,860
Look at this, there's a jungle monkey.

731
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:22,660
Monkey!

732
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,100
Nothing right about this.

733
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:33,840
Isn't like, we're mermaids invented because the sailors got like, because sailors got extremely lonely.

734
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:37,140
So when they saw a manatee, they thought it looked like a woman.

735
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:40,020
Isn't that how mermaids were born?

736
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,600
Honestly, like how the fuck do you confuse a woman with a manatee?

737
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,680
Here, hear me out.

738
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:54,260
Yeah, I want to go to Tortuga.

739
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:00,700
I think the lonely part is...

740
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:01,400
Oh, man.

741
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:10,110
Oh, yeah, they were probably as loosening.

742
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:11,730
Oh, yeah, Scurvy does crazy shit.

743
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:13,790
He didn't have enough oranges.

744
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:16,230
Make way, landlubbers.

745
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:19,370
This bit is beginning to appear this for an old sult.

746
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:22,630
But where is Captain Hook?

747
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:27,450
Aboard the Jolly Rogers sailing about Skull Island.

748
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:30,970
Do you know how I can get there?

749
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:36,230
Should ye be so foolish and seek gentlemen Starkey in the jungle?

750
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:39,790
Now stand aside.

751
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,310
Whoa, goodbye.

752
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,850
Every day, something new.

753
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:52,150
Don't forget that we got a fine hook and get that missing part of the rocket.

754
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:55,610
Okay, fine hook.

755
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:56,750
Holy shit.

756
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:59,190
What happened to regular Captain Hook?

757
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:01,950
Wait, Shmi isn't like a forgotten character.

758
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:05,710
He still has a Peter Pan ride.

759
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:10,250
I can't believe Sherman left without me.

760
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:12,590
And I'm the one that opened the projector screen.

761
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:16,410
The guides keep me from getting my bag from the far side of the harbor.

762
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:20,050
I can't flee to venture the animal out of it.

763
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:20,450
Who?

764
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:24,290
Shmi!

765
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:29,630
It's me, the guy that gets abused.

766
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:35,210
I'm willing to give you a watch sketch for free if you get that bag for me.

767
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:36,090
What's a watch?

768
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:39,830
I'm sure your gremlin buddy will tell you when the time is right.

769
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:42,610
It's good, though.

770
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:43,850
I have plenty of them.

771
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:48,550
I opened the project screen to the jungle for you, too.

772
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:49,990
You get me that my goods.

773
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:51,790
Okay, he needs this bag.

774
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:53,750
I already forgot where it was.

775
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:55,270
He, like, pointed me to the direction.

776
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:56,050
I already forgot.

777
01:10:57,570 --> 01:11:00,050
Wait, actually, wait, I can paint through this.

778
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:01,370
And grab.

779
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:03,310
Oh, I got Daisy's legs.

780
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:04,770
Ooh, la-la-la.

781
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:09,790
Whoa, I got her legs.

782
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:10,630
Ooh, la-la.

783
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:16,230
Oh, yeah.

784
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:16,930
My favorite.

785
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:18,270
I think it's really funny.

786
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:22,930
That reminded me because I was like, oh, yeah, they made La Fugue for Gaston.

787
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:25,310
Which I mean, like, come on.

788
01:11:27,530 --> 01:12:25,030
the blood all right oh shit was that supposed to happen yeah oh it was um wait what that up i don't think that rock was supposed to was that rock supposed to collapse like oh it was okay um and i think and i think it was funny because i remember i saw like an article or youtube video being like uh disney has a problem with like try trying to make whenever they make a whenever they make a gay character in disney they always they're they always be like the first gay disney character and there's been like 20 of those they've been like 20 characters that happen to be The first gay Disney character.

789
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:31,470
Friends!

790
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:34,110
My friend beam!

791
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:38,750
No, no, you don't understand.

792
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:41,750
This is the first one.

793
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:44,790
Are you not all friends yet?

794
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:45,470
I wonder.

795
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:47,990
Let's just hang out.

796
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:52,610
Okay, but this one is gayer than the next.

797
01:12:52,630 --> 01:13:19,130
last I just thought that was funny because it's true though they every time they're like but first time Disney has ever made a gay character and then it's like their 20th time their power creep me being gay all

798
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:26,420
right it's like how the first 10 comments are always someone saying first.

799
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,640
It's true.

800
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:31,720
Friend!

801
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,060
Where's my other friend guy?

802
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:35,780
Friend!

803
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:42,260
I'll become friends with you by force.

804
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,860
Okay, we gotta get rid of this.

805
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:47,260
I know.

806
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:55,460
I was trapped in here and unable to help as these mechanical bees herded the pirates off the Skull Island.

807
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:57,620
I have to save of the pipes here.

808
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:59,820
That should keep those flattish from showing up.

809
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:00,940
Wait.

810
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:02,120
Where?

811
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:07,260
When was that going on?

812
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,160
Alright, painting.

813
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,220
Oh, wait.

814
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,120
There's something over here.

815
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:15,720
How do I get past here, though?

816
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:20,580
Uh...

817
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:22,580
Maybe here?

818
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:23,480
No.

819
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:26,000
Try to figure this out.

820
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:30,280
Yeah, maybe...

821
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:31,160
No, that's not here.

822
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,120
He didn't say he left his bag somewhere.

823
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,560
I guess, like, here, maybe?

824
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:40,180
I really should have, like, paid attention where he was pointing the bag.

825
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,940
I was absolutely not paying attention.

826
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:52,130
Let's see.

827
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:53,290
Oh, hey, money.

828
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:54,710
That must be...

829
01:14:54,710 --> 01:14:55,510
Oh, there it is!

830
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:56,470
There's his bag!

831
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:01,560
Okay.

832
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,160
Oh, wait, there's, like...

833
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:05,940
It's like a painting over here.

834
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:06,740
Do I make this?

835
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,320
I do.

836
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,660
If I do my extra jump.

837
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:14,960
Parkour!

838
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:17,120
Yeah, I'll go this way because it's faster.

839
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:20,840
This opens up a different portal.

840
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:25,460
Alright.

841
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,240
We go the fast way.

842
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:29,760
I'll go the shortcut.

843
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,240
Yeah!

844
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,040
Yeah!

845
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:38,680
Damn joe boys looted before getting locked up.

846
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,080
Just full of rocks now.

847
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,560
Mind getting them to give it back?

848
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:43,840
They don't fear me.

849
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:47,060
But you might give them a pause to consider the error of their ways.

850
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,160
I almost forgot.

851
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,760
It's dangerous to go alone.

852
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:50,680
Take this.

853
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,160
Oh my god!

854
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:53,220
That's Zelda!

855
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,440
Watch sketch.

856
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,100
You have a watch sketch.

857
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:04,100
Ever waited a long line that never moved?

858
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:07,280
Makes time move almost as slowly.

859
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:08,280
Oh!

860
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,520
Oh, it's like the TV.

861
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,360
Okay, I don't remember what the TV...

862
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,160
Oh, it's like, it's an activator.

863
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:20,820
Press LB.

864
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:22,800
Everything is slowed down.

865
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,180
You move at normal speed.

866
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,200
Imagine if Nintendo...

867
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,060
It's like...

868
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:28,880
What's it called?

869
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,100
Mutual...

870
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:43,240
Like, you know how, like, how, like, everyone has, like, weapons of mass destruction, but nobody wants to use it, because, like, everybody has it.

871
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:44,960
It's like that.

872
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:46,860
They don't want to sue each other, because...

873
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:51,880
Yeah, mutually assured destruction.

874
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:52,760
Yeah.

875
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,000
So, like, none of them wants to sue each other, because they know...

876
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,200
They have a mutual assured destruction.

877
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:01,880
Oh, I'm so sorry, friend!

878
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:02,740
It's okay.

879
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:04,060
I'll give you my friend juice.

880
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:04,680
Yeah.

881
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,080
So none of them wants to...

882
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:09,860
Oh, hey, there's the key.

883
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:13,440
Okay, now can I use it?

884
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,580
Now can I use it?

885
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,640
Where the fuck is that key for?

886
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:27,360
He said these guys stole his shit.

887
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,020
Like, these guys beat him up and took his lunch money.

888
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,830
Okay, maybe there's something over here that I missed.

889
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:38,690
Must be.

890
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:41,410
I definitely missed something.

891
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:47,430
Let's see what's over here.

892
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:50,830
Oh, it was just more paint.

893
01:17:54,130 --> 01:17:55,310
Wait, there's something down here.

894
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:57,650
Oh, there's more keys!

895
01:17:58,730 --> 01:17:59,470
Now I can choose...

896
01:17:59,470 --> 01:18:02,430
So you did know these keys only work once.

897
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:02,930
Okay.

898
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:05,970
But where does that open it?

899
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:08,490
Where are the jail cells?

900
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:18,010
Yeah, so Disney and Nintendo don't want to sue each other because they know if they try to sue each other, like, it'll never stop.

901
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:25,470
I assume they have so much fuck you lawyer money that, like, it'll actually never end.

902
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:31,110
It'll be like a court case that lasts for, like, like, decades.

903
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:35,530
Okay.

904
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:37,110
Where the fuck?

905
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:39,150
The boss!

906
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:40,870
It's your cold war!

907
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:45,050
That was a handshake agreement.

908
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:52,630
Oh yeah, there was a YouTube shirt that showed up on my algorithm.

909
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:54,230
Oh hey, there's another junkie.

910
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:59,110
I can let those bad apples out now if I want to.

911
01:18:59,350 --> 01:18:59,970
Which one?

912
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:01,870
We're all bad here.

913
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:11,870
The reason why we have parody laws is because there was this one cartoonist that just kept drawing like Disney porn

914
01:19:16,810 --> 01:19:53,670
We're like Because he was trying to like Get like freedom of speech in like Parity law like he was trying to get like Parity law a thing Because there was no fair use laws back then In America so back then in America There wasn't any fair use laws So because of that like Disney like big companies Could like basically sue people for Drawing like like know for like doing anything with their characters and then there was this one cartoonist that hated that concept so he just started drawing disneypoint and like to fight for fair use yeah

915
01:19:57,210 --> 01:20:03,830
and then he got like a bunch of he got like a bunch of artists to like work together

916
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:14,410
just Mickey and Vinny and other Disney characters banging.

917
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:20,430
Okay, fun fact.

918
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:27,770
Fun, not the hero we need it, but the hero we deserve.

919
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:33,350
Yeah, and then Disney did sue him because he was like, they were like, stop.

920
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:38,950
And then Disney sued him, and then he took it to the Supreme Court.

921
01:20:39,910 --> 01:21:02,970
They took it to, he took it to federal court, so that fair use, um, and then, and then after he took it to, like, the federal court, um, even though he lost, he technically, he didn't win the case, but he got, he got fair use laws implemented, and he didn't even have to pay for any lawyer fees for it.

922
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:17,070
he like he technically won the case because he didn't have to pay any lawyer freeze do you have links to this so we can afford oh no that sounds terrible what's the sword

923
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:35,270
yeah he basically won and that's why we can that's why we have rule 34 he's yeah he's like the jesus christ of rule 34 Many thank you for the super chat.

924
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:35,770

Maybe try the green floor next to the door.

930
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:12,510
There's a green floor.

931
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:19,780
There's a green floor.

932
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:21,960
Where the fuck is the green floor?

933
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:30,690
How is the story not a movie?

934
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:36,590
I'm so stuck on this area.

935
01:22:39,750 --> 01:23:01,580
I think there's a lot of reasons why it's why it's not a movie yet where else do I go I'm not trying to figure this place out I feel like oh my god oh my god there was a oh wait no never mind this wasn't a secret I was gonna be I thought I figured it out

Wait, it's this thing.

940
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:18,850
It was a rock here earlier.

941
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:22,350
Where did the rock go?

942
01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:23,950
Wait, no.

943
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:26,270
What's the point of this rock?

944
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:30,490
There's another house that seems to have an entrance from the roof.

945
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:31,390
Oh, there was.

946
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:33,510
Okay, let's find it out.

947
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:35,970
Some of these are not very intuitive.

948
01:24:36,130 --> 01:24:37,170
Unless I'm...

949
01:24:37,170 --> 01:24:38,170
Dumber than a child.

950
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:38,850
No.

951
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:45,630
Maybe a child just explores more.

952
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:46,250
Maybe?

953
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:53,470
No, that can't be it.

954
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:54,850
Guys, no.

955
01:24:57,490 --> 01:24:58,530
Stop, guys.

956
01:24:58,770 --> 01:24:59,650
That can't be it.

957
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:03,430
Maybe?

958
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:04,750
Okay.

959
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:06,510
That doesn't do anything.

960
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:09,030
That also didn't do anything.

961
01:25:10,030 --> 01:25:13,290
Yeah, my Oshi couldn't be Dumber than a 5th grader.

962
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:14,030
Guys, no.

963
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:18,890
Guys, I beat 5th grade.

964
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:21,450
That can't be true.

965
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:23,790
I have three keys!

966
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:27,770
I don't understand!

967
01:25:28,210 --> 01:25:29,930
Let me use my keys!

968
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:33,990
I have three keys!

969
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:38,210
I can't go down here.

970
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:39,970
Oh.

971
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:42,710
Oh my god, we're, like, actually stuck in purgatory right now.

972
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:46,590
Alright, I gotta figure out where to go.

973
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:51,110
Are these the jail cells?

974
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:52,870
What are the jail cells?

975
01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:00,060
Like, these are the jail cells, and I have the keys.

976
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:05,000
Let me in.

977
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:07,200
Let me in.

978
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,740
Maybe if I...

979
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:10,160
Oh.

980
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:11,940
Oh.

981
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,040
Guys, I figured

01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:46,680
That's it I have a key And I don't even unlock it What's the point of having a key Wait Oh, that's the point Okay, you have the key Alright, that's the That's what the key is for You're not spiders In the fifth Glader This sash down there fixed the gears in that goods.

983
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,580
Alright, let's fix all of them.

984
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:52,360
Alright, here we go.

985
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:54,880
A gear down there is hooked to an old ride.

986
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:57,020
Never had the nerve to spin it.

987
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:58,420
Alright.

988
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,080
I use a key.

989
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:01,960
I'll share one of my secrets with you.

990
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:05,100
At least I'm free.

991
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:07,380
Parts of an old ride are submerged in the harbor.

992
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:11,300
Restoring the lamps that used to cause the rise of it.

993
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:12,380
Wait, how do I restore the lamps?

994
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,300
Oh, okay.

995
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:16,960
Okay, we gotta paint the lanterns and stuff.

996
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,100
Okay, I did it, guys.

997
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:20,780
I fucking did it.

998
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:23,120
It was just that easy.

999
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:26,580
Okay, there's three lanterns.

1000
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,420
There's one over here.

1001
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:31,020
There's two over here.

1002
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,380
There's a third lantern.

1003
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:37,360
Where's the third lantern?

1004
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:39,720
Okay, lantern.

1005
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,140
Lantern!

1006
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:44,880
Where are you?

1007
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:47,160
Like, it's a door!

1008
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:52,100
How was I supposed to know I had to just, like, un-paint the door?

1009
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:54,680
Like...

1010
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:57,500
I am a hero.

1011
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,320
Alright.

1012
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,820
Where the fuck is the last lantern?

1013
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:10,580
It's like, the lantern's not here, but I'm gonna talk to them just in case.

1014
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:14,480
Okay.

1015
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:16,820
What the fuck is it?

1016
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,660
It showed me two lanterns.

1017
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:22,980
Is it up top?

1018
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:26,340
I don't see anything here.

1019
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:27,600
Oops, sorry.

1020
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,180
My little friend Shabim got to him.

1021
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:34,680
Yeah, I'll go up here first though.

1022
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:35,960
Oh, it is up here!

1023
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:38,660
There we go.

1024
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:41,920
Hey, nice.

1025
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:46,360
truth is, I know.

1026
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:47,100
Know what?

1027
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:56,190
A here inside the well is linked to an old line of missing pirate.

1028
01:28:57,850 --> 01:29:00,310
Big P needs to help with Petronic.

1029
01:29:00,430 --> 01:29:01,270
Oh, I already got that.

1030
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,430
Wait.

1031
01:29:03,330 --> 01:29:05,230
What was the other hint that he said?

1032
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:08,950
I already forgot the other hint he told me.

1033
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:11,990
What was the other hint?

1034
01:29:14,870 --> 01:29:17,470
I already forgot what the other hint was.

1035
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:21,250
Okay, we'll just go for that place first before we try and figure this.

1036
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:26,050
I know about there was the well, but what the fuck was the other hint that he tried to tell me?

1037
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:28,590
No, no, there was a third guy.

1038
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:29,630
There was a third hint.

1039
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:31,410
There were three people I freed.

1040
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:34,130
Guys, there was one more hint.

1041
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:43,250
No, I know about the well, but there was one more.

1042
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:48,620
Damn.

1043
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:51,360
We paint this so we can it.

1044
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:58,610
Okay, we know about the lanterns and the well, but there was one more.

1045
01:29:59,690 --> 01:30:00,870
Oh my god, that's it.

1046
01:30:00,970 --> 01:30:01,770
That's all I get.

1047
01:30:02,650 --> 01:30:05,010
I did all of that just for a fucking pin.

1048
01:30:08,530 --> 01:30:09,430
Oh, it's the underground.

1049
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:10,950
Oh, it's the underground.

1050
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:16,210
Okay, we gotta figure out how to unlock that area, man.

1051
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:18,810
Where the How the fuck do we unlock the well?

1052
01:30:22,690 --> 01:30:23,110
Okay.

1053
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:26,550
How do we unlock it?

1054
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:29,310
Will I just unpaint this?

1055
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:31,810
I did nothing.

1056
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:32,810
Oh, it did something.

1057
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:33,890
Oh!

1058
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:36,730
Go down.

1059
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:37,850
Down we go.

1060
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:39,910
Nice.

1061
01:30:41,790 --> 01:30:42,830
Oh, nice!

1062
01:30:43,390 --> 01:30:44,690
I drained it.

1063
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:46,170
I didn't drain it.

1064
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:47,190
I didn't drain it.

1065
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:52,090
Wait, what's the point?

1066
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:52,870
What's the...

1067
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:53,810
Oh, it's for this.

1068
01:30:58,210 --> 01:30:58,850
It's...

1069
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:02,930
I didn't drain it, guys.

1070
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:05,370
The bronze pin.

1071
01:31:08,490 --> 01:31:08,730
Alright.

1072
01:31:09,450 --> 01:31:10,290
This way.

1073
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:12,390
Up we go.

1074
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:14,830
And then...

1075
01:31:14,830 --> 01:31:16,370
And then we open this pathway.

1076
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:19,590
Right here.

1077
01:31:20,610 --> 01:31:21,130
Hello, sir.

1078
01:31:23,290 --> 01:31:28,430
I don't understand how being a fucking cool-ass half-robot is considered a bad thing.

1079
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:33,150
How could that be bad?

1080
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:34,230
Oh, my God.

1081
01:31:35,470 --> 01:31:37,350
Those scurvy spatters are trying to keep...

1082
01:31:37,350 --> 01:31:37,790
Oh, my God.

1083
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:38,870
They're gatekeeping me!

1084
01:31:40,270 --> 01:31:41,950
Spin the gears and hurry.

1085
01:31:42,170 --> 01:31:42,910
Oh, that's easy.

1086
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:50,260
There it is.

1087
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:58,240
it's just that easy how do i use my

1088
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:22,900
all right there we go and then we got a little cut list damn that was so hard guys i swear the actual post the the the the the action part is like so easy compared to the puzzle is like made for college students and then the action part is where it was made for children.

1089
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:26,120
Alright, here we go.

1090
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:27,020
You should cut this.

1091
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:31,340
I heard Sherman tell you to find Starky in the jungle.

1092
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:32,520
Well, I owe you one.

1093
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:36,160
Since you got my goods back from me, I'll open the projector screen to the jungle.

1094
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,120
Head to the one near the water wheel.

1095
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,340
It'll be the one on by the time you get there.

1096
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:41,060
Alright, nice.

1097
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:42,540
I found the lost belongings.

1098
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:45,260
This is why most kids got the bad ending.

1099
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:47,320
I think most adults got the bad ending too.

1100
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:52,660
Because I'm going to say is being evil is just so much more fun than being good.

1101
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:57,980
Alright, go to the jungle.

1102
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,440
In the jungle.

1103
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:00,860
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1104
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:03,920
The lion sleeps tonight.

1105
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,800
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1106
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:07,480
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1107
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,580
The lion sleeps tonight.

1108
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:16,140
Alright, we go this way.

1109
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,380
I am a good person.

1110
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:52,840

Thank you.

1115
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:27,630
Alright, Doki.

1116
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:28,690
Yes, I missed a lot of streams.

1117
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:35,630
Did you reach a goal once so that Doki Papa streams him playing for the PS5?

1118
01:34:36,290 --> 01:34:37,010
Yeah, we did.

1119
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:38,230
I haven't done it yet, though.

1120
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:39,230
But thank you for the super chat.

Thank you, thank you.

01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:44,130
We're getting through all the goals, though.

1123
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:46,850
There's a hangman tree.

1124
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:49,070
The only way out of the jungle is through here.

1125
01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:50,830
Oh, that must be Starkey.

1126
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:51,910
We should hurry them.

1127
01:34:54,470 --> 01:35:08,450

Fairly, right?

1131
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:06,510
It's just the guy that's in the middle, like, this isn't a zombie, but it's like, no, I just...

1132
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:08,390
No, I got bit by my dog.

1133
01:36:14,830 --> 01:36:15,730
No, no, guys.

1134
01:36:15,810 --> 01:36:18,510
I will be the one that...

1135
01:36:18,510 --> 01:36:20,490
Don't worry, guys.

1136
01:36:20,590 --> 01:36:21,670
I'm the main character.

1137
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:22,550
I'll survive.

1138
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:25,250
I'm the main character.

1139
01:36:29,230 --> 01:36:29,790
What's this?

1140
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:31,170
Oh, I got one of the eyes.

1141
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:36,820
See that?

1142
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,020
The stone head releases a lock when it's rotated.

1143
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:39,640
Okay.

1144
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:42,400
Yikes, that pilot looks dangerous.

1145
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:46,280
Wait, is this the cyborg pirate or, like, an actual robot?

1146
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:52,580
Wait, can I become friends with him?

1147
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:54,380
I don't think I can be friends with him, guys.

1148
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:55,700
Wait, how do I?

1149
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:56,920
Oh, he's at the back.

1150
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:57,280
Okay.

1151
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:00,100
Wait.

1152
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:02,540
Oh my god, that's so bullshit!

1153
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:07,520
Swing.

1154
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:10,600
Okay.

1155
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,060
Alright, there you go.

1156
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:16,100
And then he'll just let...

1157
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,820
Okay, I need to grab some HP real quick.

1158
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:20,140
Alright.

1159
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:25,580
Let me use my not friendship blade.

1160
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:27,800
Okay.

1161
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:29,200
There we go.

1162
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,080
Each kind of...

1163
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:32,420
Oh, these are all the...

1164
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:33,540
That's all the robots.

1165
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:36,980
Alright.

1166
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:39,840
I still want a treasure...

1167
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:42,160
Treasure Island...

1168
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:43,140
Treasure Planet Sequel?

1169
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:45,060
I don't think that's ever gonna happen, guys.

1170
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:45,880
You gotta move on.

1171
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:47,240
You know what we'll get first?

1172
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:49,520
We won't get Treasure Planet Sequel.

1173
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,060
We'll get live action treasure planet.

1174
01:37:56,900 --> 01:38:01,080
We're more likely to get live action treasure planet than this animated series.

1175
01:38:01,100 --> 01:39:03,200
sequel that'd be me we need to find captain hook be his friends or his foes um whichever keeps me the healthiest we're not exactly friends with hook are you oh please do not curse us hook's got man and the rest of his crew his new crew they'd be monsters but some of us stay behind the fight us reach hook huh indeed i might if you help me first well sure what do you need near hangman's tree stands a stone bear one of three symbols find all three and share him with me then will you tell us the password to reach scull island i but only when you scar the jungle be wary of feather and green tights is fitting about scull island as well if hook sees him that'd be We can't get to Skull Island without the password.

1176
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:04,880
We're fine, you symbols.

1177
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:06,300
What's Starkey give it to us?

1178
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:07,840
Trust the pirate.

1179
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:09,100
What could go wrong?

1180
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:11,220
Okay, but pirates, they...

1181
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:18,560
Even though, like, pirates love to steal and kill and, like, do other horrible things, um, they're very honorable.

1182
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:25,280
They're very honorable people.

1183
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:29,560
Even though they do all the other bad things there, at least they have honor.

1184
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:30,820
They have the cold.

1185
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:36,140
There'd be a handful of villains in this jungle.

1186
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:38,580
Anyone which could lay starkly low.

1187
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:41,420
Say about making them less frightening.

1188
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:43,620
I'll make it worth your while.

1189
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:45,160
Arr.

1190
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:50,660
Oh, there's another stone.

1191
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:51,960
Or jewel.

1192
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:57,240
A jewel is technically a a prettier stone.

1193
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:58,620
If you think about it.

1194
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:02,060
A jewel is just like a stone with colors.

1195
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:12,380
what's over here oh there you go okay so we got one of them oh there's the other stone

1196
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:46,600
these aren't even rare anyway too i don't guys know this but why would someone put lanterns in the jungle i don't know why would people do a lot of crazy shit in this jungle i don't guys know this but diamonds aren't even diamonds are like manufactured rare they're not even like um they're not even supposed to be that expensive it's just because there's a monopoly on diamonds what the fuck do i free you you're all just trapped there

1197
01:40:49,820 --> 01:41:06,720
oh where the fuck do i go i'm sure lost anything yeah yeah we can literally make we can manufacture diamonds oh shit okay yeah synthetic diamonds.

1198
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:10,160
That's what I don't...

1199
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:10,920
I don't know.

1200
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:13,420
Also, like...

1201
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:14,440
They're so ugly.

1202
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:17,140
I find...

1203
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:17,460
I don't know.

1204
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:19,080
I find diamonds to be pretty ugly.

1205
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,240
There's, like, nicer...

1206
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:23,200
There's, like, nicer gems and rocks.

1207
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,180
Okay, there's that one.

1208
01:41:29,060 --> 01:41:33,940
In my opinion, I feel like there's nicer, prettier rocks than diamonds.

1209
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:45,560
And diamonds are like...

1210
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:50,240
And I don't know.

1211
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:54,180
Diamonds are just expensive just because there's a monopoly on them.

1212
01:41:55,940 --> 01:41:59,340
Why do I have like the most interesting topics on my most e-book games?

1213
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:06,460
We're missing out on part three of Epic Mickey.

1214
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:08,720
People are missing out.

1215
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:12,800
My brother hates diamonds and flowers.

1216
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:16,960
The nerf though is just too strong.

1217
01:42:17,780 --> 01:42:18,220
Oh wait, here.

1218
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:19,980
It's the last password.

1219
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:22,300
That's all the symbols.

1220
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:23,780
Let's return this starkey.

1221
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:26,680
Alright, let's see.

1222
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:31,160
That's why you can't miss out.

1223
01:42:31,940 --> 01:42:33,420
Go through some insane shit.

1224
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:36,400
Now you have multiple fun facts to share to your friends.

1225
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:40,640
Guys, which one was the most fun one?

1226
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:47,500
Which, guys, which part do you think was your most fun part?

1227
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:51,020
Most fun fact that you learned today, guys!

1228
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,440
Wait, why am I here?

1229
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:59,600
This thing isn't even going down.

1230
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:01,740
Definitely the cola.

1231
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:05,480
Except for the Coca-Cola.

1232
01:43:11,870 --> 01:43:12,550
Okay.

1233
01:43:13,070 --> 01:43:14,290
We got all the hostiles.

1234
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:19,630
I would say that's the most fun part, fun fact.

1235
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:25,520
Is he the password guy?

1236
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:31,900
I'll let you tell you on the path of Scott Allen give you a treasure.

1237
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:33,520
I'll make any pirate cheeks turn.

1238
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:34,360
Okay, here we go.

1239
01:43:35,780 --> 01:43:38,860
Yo, bro, you're sleeping on reverse mermaids.

1240
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:45,170
How's it fun, Doki?

1241
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:46,290
You get to save money.

1242
01:43:54,910 --> 01:43:58,430
You don't have to, you don't have to pay for college tuition.

1243
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:03,550
Is there something here?

1244
01:44:05,110 --> 01:44:06,110
Okay, I'll get that.

1245
01:44:07,810 --> 01:44:11,530
I feel like, like, okay, because I'm still missing some rocks.

1246
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:13,250
And then there's the lanterns, too.

1247
01:44:13,730 --> 01:44:16,470
And then there's, there's so many things that I'm missing!

1248
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:24,700
Because, like, that's, like, where I have to.

1249
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:25,380
I have to go.

1250
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:30,500
Because there's like people trapped in their little cubbyhole shit.

1251
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:38,580
Oh my god, why are you all missing your fucking eyes anyway?

1252
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:43,940
Okay.

1253
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:46,740
This is a giant ass place too.

1254
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:48,100
I can get lost here.

1255
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:49,840
Wait, I go here yet?

1256
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:52,260
Oh no, I didn't.

1257
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:55,360
So many little secrets everywhere.

1258
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:58,740
Wait, no, I was here.

1259
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:00,820
Oh no, I was here.

1260
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:03,140
Oh my god.

1261
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:04,860
Maybe I have to get a lantern?

1262
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:09,160
I might be missing a lantern somewhere.

1263
01:45:10,620 --> 01:45:11,580
It's like they're trapped.

1264
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:13,680
How do I free you, sir?

1265
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:19,080
He's trapped.

1266
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:25,180
Doki doesn't like flowers, doesn't like diamonds, only cares of the bottom half.

1267
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:26,580
We're learning so much.

1268
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:27,180
I'm sure...

1269
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:28,900
I'm sure it's...

1270
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:34,060
Next thing, thank you for the super chat.

1271
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:34,440
Thank you.

1272
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:35,140
Thank you.

1273
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:36,820
What can I say?

1274
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:39,800
I'm like...

1275
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:40,880
What is the word called?

1276
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:42,500
When you're not demanding?

1277
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:44,560
What's that?

1278
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:46,100
What's the opposite of that?

1279
01:45:50,700 --> 01:45:52,020
I'm just a bro.

1280
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:53,080
I'm yeah.

1281
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:54,880
I'm low.

1282
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:56,320
Yeah, I'm low maintenance.

1283
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:57,680
Yeah.

1284
01:45:58,080 --> 01:45:59,460
Can I say I'm low maintenance?

1285
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:00,600
hate to this.

1286
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:03,740
Bro, I just want to play video games.

1287
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:04,900
That's it.

1288
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:08,920
I just want to play video games.

1289
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:12,460
Oh, I fucking waste money on a wedding.

1290
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:14,140
Fucking buy a house.

1291
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:14,860
I don't care.

1292
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:19,300
People also like, I, oh, what was it?

1293
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:20,040
What's his name?

1294
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:27,160
Was it Ronaldo that finally proposed to his girlfriend after 10 plus years of dating?

1295
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:59,200
And then like, she got an ugly ass ring for it and like it had like a giant ass diamond but um at a giant ass diamond but it was so ugly but it was a big ass diamond oh there it is he missed the gamescom live stream today pro it was like too early in the morning i did not if you think i i chose

1296
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:06,920
You think I was going to fucking wake up that early to watch Gamescom?

1297
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:11,260
I could barely wake up that early in general.

1298
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:14,820
Gamescom is in Germany, guys.

1299
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:16,660
You know where Germany is?

1300
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:17,380
EU.

1301
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,160
You know how early that shit was?

1302
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:25,900
I'm so low maintenance.

1303
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:27,140
I just want a house.

1304
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:31,100
Guys.

1305
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:32,860
I'm so low maintenance.

1306
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:34,860
I just want one thing.

1307
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:35,960
A house.

1308
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:44,700
I feel like I've been walking around the same place over and over.

1309
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:46,500
A house is practical.

1310
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:49,300
A house is practical.

1311
01:47:49,540 --> 01:47:52,080
What the fuck am I going to do with a diamond ring?

1312
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,620
Use it as like those knuckle bracers?

1313
01:47:58,420 --> 01:48:01,900
Where the fuck is our hitler rocks?

1314
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:06,180
A basic need.

1315
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:10,300
Joki, that stream was just an hour before this one.

1316
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,860
Yes, and you know what time I woke up?

1317
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:21,610
It was definitely after I woke up.

1318
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:26,550
Maybe here?

1319
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:28,110
It feels like I haven't been here yet.

1320
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:29,170
Oh yeah, there it is.

1321
01:48:29,210 --> 01:48:30,250
There's one more rock.

1322
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:33,210
What do you say?

1323
01:48:33,230 --> 01:48:33,650
I don't know.

1324
01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:34,410
I've been...

1325
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:37,430
It's the same thing as the other rocks that we're doing, Sparky.

1326
01:48:41,410 --> 01:48:43,610
Where the fuck is the last lantern?

1327
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:50,010
There's so many things wrong in this area.

1328
01:48:51,950 --> 01:48:53,010
God, they're so demanding.

1329
01:48:55,190 --> 01:48:59,730
Oh my god, there's so many rocks that I'm missing apparently.

1330
01:49:02,650 --> 01:49:05,710
Brad Lomis, I think it'd be you to the utilitarian.

1331
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:08,330
You value useful stuff more.

1332
01:49:08,490 --> 01:49:09,510
I think it was super tragic.

1333
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:23,690
I don't know, I just don't I don't care about like material things as much unless it's got blind boxes and I care

1334
01:49:27,490 --> 01:49:59,030
unless it's oh wait no I actually spent so much money when I was in Japan I spent unless the things thing is very unless it's very silly I buy very silly things um oh thank you for the super chat thank you thank you i have wasted money on very silly things uh i'm sorry toky but the striker will not let you into their house because i know my return i will no longer have a house to take care of thank you with the super chat oh thank you thank you

1335
01:50:02,150 --> 01:50:11,470
i swear to god i feel like i've been so lost this this entire game is It's just me being lost.

1336
01:50:12,370 --> 01:50:14,610
I'm trying to find the last lantern!

1337
01:50:16,990 --> 01:50:18,470
Cosmo, thank you for the super chat.

1338
01:50:18,710 --> 01:50:19,530
Thank you, thank you.

1339
01:50:19,690 --> 01:50:21,370
Where the fuck is the last lantern?

1340
01:50:21,490 --> 01:50:23,090
I swear to God, I'm going to beat him up.

1341
01:50:23,370 --> 01:50:26,690
If they don't tell me where the last lantern is, this guy's going to get it.

1342
01:50:26,910 --> 01:50:30,850
He's just like this random stranger, and I'm taking it out on him.

1343
01:50:31,470 --> 01:50:32,510
That's fucking right.

1344
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:38,620
Wow, dokey.

1345
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:39,480
The map!

1346
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:40,080
What do you mean?

1347
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:40,820
Check the map!

1348
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:41,360
Look at this!

1349
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:41,820
This map was...

1350
01:50:41,840 --> 01:51:12,160
drawn by a five-year-old wait what the fuck do you mean check the map what does this map tell me and it gave a five-year-old a fucking crayon it was like draw what you think this looks like like you're like oh there is there's the last guys i found the lantern guys i found the guys i did it i found the lantern see guys if you complain enough you'll find the lantern eventually Okay,

1351
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:13,440
I remember where he was trapped.

1352
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:18,500
Oh, there's like three rocks that I'm missing.

1353
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:20,400
That's the thing.

1354
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:23,640
There you go.

1355
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:26,500
All right, get out of here.

1356
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:31,580
I can lock down the gate and keep the thinner from pouring into the reverb.

1357
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:33,580
Oh, wait, where's this?

1358
01:51:37,570 --> 01:51:39,290
Wait, where the fuck is that?

1359
01:51:41,730 --> 01:51:43,470
Where did he do that?

1360
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:47,330
Could he not zoom out for me, like, a little bit?

1361
01:51:51,130 --> 01:51:53,170
Where the fuck was that?

1362
01:51:56,390 --> 01:51:58,990
Oh my god, that was not helpful.

1363
01:52:00,890 --> 01:52:02,110
It was that way, Doki.

1364
01:52:04,110 --> 01:52:04,990
Oh, it was this?

1365
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:06,190
Okay, it was this.

1366
01:52:06,630 --> 01:52:06,850
Okay.

1367
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:09,430
I thought I already did this.

1368
01:52:11,090 --> 01:52:12,650
I get... Oh, because it...

1369
01:52:12,650 --> 01:52:14,930
What did that do?

1370
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:18,090
Oh!

1371
01:52:18,310 --> 01:52:19,790
Oh, it's... Oh, there's no more thinner!

1372
01:52:20,130 --> 01:52:20,370
Okay.

1373
01:52:22,630 --> 01:52:24,450
Okay, I fixed it.

1374
01:52:25,330 --> 01:52:26,650
Okay, there's no more thinner now.

1375
01:52:28,810 --> 01:52:30,630
Okay, now there has to be the rocks here.

1376
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:39,500
We just gotta find the other rocks.

1377
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:50,140
Alright, where are the other rocks located then?

1378
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:52,900
Hello, rocks.

1379
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:53,880
Where are you?

1380
01:52:57,120 --> 01:52:57,640
Okay.

1381
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:00,380
Guess we got more money.

1382
01:53:03,820 --> 01:53:05,560
What's the point of sitting this?

1383
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:07,160
There's like literally nothing here.

1384
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,080
There's just money.

1385
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:15,260
Where the fuck?

1386
01:53:19,050 --> 01:53:20,130
Wait, there's no point.

1387
01:53:20,970 --> 01:53:22,390
There's just extra tickets.

1388
01:53:23,410 --> 01:53:24,250
I'm pretty sure.

1389
01:53:25,510 --> 01:53:27,110
How epic would you rate this?

1390
01:53:27,130 --> 01:53:57,330
game I mean it's pretty fun it's a platformer it's a good platformer more money for the mouse the mouse of house I missed that show that was such a good show I guess we got like the treasure chest but I feel like that was pointless that felt so pointless I'm still missing like Like,

1391
01:53:57,910 --> 01:54:02,170
one, two, three rocks.

1392
01:54:02,550 --> 01:54:05,330
How is there three more rocks around here?

1393
01:54:06,090 --> 01:54:07,150
I swear to God.

1394
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:08,930
Yeah, that was a really, that was a good show.

1395
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:11,670
They don't make those types of shows anymore.

1396
01:54:13,050 --> 01:54:17,190
It's like, they don't want to give Mickey Mouse a personality because he's supposed to be, like, a cookie cutter.

1397
01:54:18,030 --> 01:54:19,270
Like, he's just a mascot.

1398
01:54:21,290 --> 01:54:23,530
So, they don't give him any personality anymore.

1399
01:54:26,710 --> 01:54:32,150
I'm I'm about to give up I'm actually I'm just close to giving up

1400
01:54:38,530 --> 01:54:57,590
Oh my god I swear to god I feel like I've unpainted everything The newer Mickey Mouse shorts Were amazing I think I know what Mickey Mouse shorts you're talking about But I don't think you realize That was like What five plus years ago

1401
01:55:00,710 --> 01:55:02,830
They've ended that show.

1402
01:55:04,650 --> 01:55:05,290
They...

1403
01:55:05,290 --> 01:55:08,150
Yeah, quote-unquote, new way.

1404
01:55:09,390 --> 01:55:09,730
Yeah.

1405
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:17,800
I feel like...

1406
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:22,540
I'm never gonna find the last three stones, am I?

1407
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:25,600
You check behind the big tickeys?

1408
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:31,540
In the tic-e-tic-e-tic-e-tic-e-tic-e-tic-e-tic-e-tic-e-tic-e-tic-e-tic-e-tic.

1409
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:32,760
These guys?

1410
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:33,600
Yeah.

1411
01:56:02,450 --> 01:56:04,590
I'm still missing one more.

1412
01:56:04,910 --> 01:56:08,070
I'm so... Where the fuck is this guy's last eye?

1413
01:56:08,730 --> 01:56:10,930
Where is his last eye?

1414
01:56:13,870 --> 01:56:15,070
Oh my god.

1415
01:56:15,230 --> 01:56:15,970
It doesn't matter.

1416
01:56:16,110 --> 01:56:18,090
I'm still missing one more rock.

1417
01:56:19,670 --> 01:56:20,430
I'm...

1418
01:56:20,430 --> 01:56:22,130
It doesn't even matter.

1419
01:56:22,650 --> 01:56:25,290
I'm still missing one more rock.

1420
01:56:26,210 --> 01:56:28,430
Wherever the fuck this last fucking rock.

1421
01:56:28,450 --> 01:56:29,550
rock is.

1422
01:56:29,950 --> 01:56:37,670
It doesn't matter.

1423
01:56:38,410 --> 01:56:40,370
I'm still missing one.

1424
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:46,160
Wherever this fucking rock is.

1425
01:56:47,620 --> 01:56:52,440
Good job, Oh my god.

1426
01:56:52,660 --> 01:56:55,600
Where could this last rock be?

1427
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:03,060
Doesn't even matter.

1428
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:06,340
Where are you?

1429
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:07,620
It's so fine.

1430
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:10,780
Oh my god.

1431
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:12,580
It's not in here.

1432
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:18,280
Yeah, I checked them already.

1433
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:20,400
The king paint.

1434
01:57:20,980 --> 01:57:22,560
Paints the rocks.

1435
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:28,060
And yet, it didn't even matter.

1436
01:57:29,380 --> 01:57:31,700
Where the fuck is the last one?

1437
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:35,460
Guys, someone...

1438
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:38,280
Someone look up no commentary.

1439
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:42,360
Epic Mickey Rebrush and help me find the last rock.

1440
01:57:42,860 --> 01:57:45,520
Where... I can't... I can't stay here.

1441
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:47,700
We can't be here forever.

1442
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:51,400
Look up.

1443
01:57:51,580 --> 01:57:52,620
Why look up?

1444
01:57:53,860 --> 01:57:55,400
Nothing above me.

1445
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:01,080
I feel like I went through all of this.

1446
01:58:05,420 --> 01:58:06,560
What do you mean look up?

1447
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,260
I've looked up.

1448
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:11,300
Been here?

1449
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:14,200
I've been here.

1450
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:14,880
Look at this.

1451
01:58:15,020 --> 01:58:15,720
I painted that.

1452
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:20,260
And then I painted that too.

1453
01:58:20,980 --> 01:58:21,800
You got that.

1454
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:25,260
Wait, you saw it?

1455
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:27,960
Where did you see it?

1456
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:37,000
There's no way Where did you see it?

1457
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:39,180
I passed it?

1458
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:39,720
How?

1459
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:42,780
There's no way you're fucking with me right now

1460
01:58:46,160 --> 01:58:51,440
It's a red rock It's right there, Toki.

1461
01:58:51,560 --> 01:58:59,720
No, there's no way You guys are actually fucking with me There's no way There's no way you guys There's no way you guys are fucking with me right now

1462
01:59:05,330 --> 01:59:06,690
It's not here.

1463
01:59:12,060 --> 01:59:12,380
How?

1464
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:13,960
There's no way I passed it.

1465
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:17,380
There's no fucking way I passed it.

1466
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:19,140
You used to believe that.

1467
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:21,900
I'm getting baited.

1468
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:24,260
I'm getting baited.

1469
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:24,820
I...

1470
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:25,240
I...

1471
01:59:25,860 --> 01:59:26,020
I...

1472
01:59:26,020 --> 01:59:28,180
I'm getting rage bait right here.

1473
01:59:33,890 --> 01:59:35,090
Oh my god.

1474
01:59:35,290 --> 01:59:36,110
I swear to God.

1475
01:59:36,270 --> 01:59:38,530
I feel like I've been here for 20 years.

1476
01:59:38,790 --> 01:59:40,390
In this one area.

1477
01:59:40,510 --> 01:59:41,570
In just this area.

1478
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:41,990
area.

1479
01:59:42,770 --> 01:59:44,870
We're gonna spend our entire life in here.

1480
01:59:58,390 --> 02:00:02,270
If I was the last rock, where would I be?

1481
02:00:04,490 --> 02:00:06,410
Where the fuck would I be?

1482
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:18,100
Oh my god, where is this?

1483
02:00:18,860 --> 02:00:19,740
Where is it?

1484
02:00:24,180 --> 02:00:25,980
I've unpainted everything!

1485
02:00:26,180 --> 02:00:27,780
What else can be unpainted?

1486
02:00:34,810 --> 02:00:37,490
Yeah, I- that was where the last one was.

1487
02:00:39,450 --> 02:00:41,050
I'm on the right track.

1488

1492
02:00:50,450 --> 02:00:51,890

1498
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:12,160

1515
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:38,840
Why is there a bear down there?

1516
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:45,120
In the Tiki Tiki.

1517
02:02:45,140 --> 02:02:49,540
Tiki, tiki, tiki, little in the Tiki, the Whalers.

1518
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:50,920
Whoa, what's this?

1519
02:02:52,060 --> 02:02:52,480
Yes.

1520
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:55,320
Yeah, to hold Donald's hand, guys.

1521
02:02:55,780 --> 02:02:58,000
Guys, to get to third base and hold his hand.

1522
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:02,480
Exactly.

1523
02:03:03,980 --> 02:03:05,800
I don't know what else you guys were expecting.

1524
02:03:11,020 --> 02:03:11,660
Oh, nice.

1525
02:03:11,860 --> 02:03:12,240
Film.

1526
02:03:14,860 --> 02:03:16,620
That song is going to be stuck in my head for a while.

1527
02:03:18,140 --> 02:03:18,940
song, though.

1528
02:03:19,060 --> 02:03:21,380
And the tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki.

1529
02:03:23,740 --> 02:03:24,180
Ow.

1530
02:03:24,460 --> 02:03:26,020
I don't know what I expected.

1531
02:03:26,260 --> 02:03:26,760
Not gonna lie.

1532
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:30,180
I don't know what I expect.

1533
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:31,200
I don't know.

1534
02:03:31,260 --> 02:03:33,940
I thought it would boost me up like a little rocket jump.

1535
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:35,080
Like, what was the point?

1536
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:41,880
I feel like there's no point in getting these tickets.

1537
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:43,260
Like, I'm fucking rich already.

1538
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:48,340
What's this?

1539
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:52,200
Oh.

1540
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:53,020
Oh, nice.

1541
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:53,680
No secret.

1542
02:03:59,910 --> 02:04:00,430
Oh?

1543
02:04:00,990 --> 02:04:02,210
It doesn't matter.

1544
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:05,630
Back here, you'll bird.

1545
02:04:07,430 --> 02:04:09,230
All birds are just government spies.

1546
02:04:10,650 --> 02:04:12,950
Made to surveillance, yo, because it's just cheaper.

1547
02:04:14,850 --> 02:04:17,190
It's just cheaper than paying Google for your data.

1548
02:04:18,210 --> 02:04:19,590
If you think about it.

1549
02:04:22,940 --> 02:04:23,520
Oh, shit.

1550
02:04:23,860 --> 02:04:24,720
That's not what I want to do.

1551
02:04:31,590 --> 02:04:33,330
Uh, okay, we gotta go this way.

1552
02:04:34,250 --> 02:04:35,050
Are you?

1553
02:04:37,490 --> 02:04:38,870
I'll never say.

1554
02:04:41,150 --> 02:04:43,350
Someone didn't read the terms of service.

1555
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:49,120
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

1556
02:04:49,260 --> 02:04:49,900
Thank you, thank you.

1557
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:54,440
You forgot my one-sixth and one-hour birthday, but now it's my one-sixth and two-hour birthday.

1558
02:04:55,260 --> 02:04:55,840
Uh, can I...

1559
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:56,720
Sure, no problem.

1560
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:58,780
Okay, happy birth.

1561

1562
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:00,820
Thank you, thank you.

1563
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:06,060
I got the Whalers.

1564
02:05:08,020 --> 02:05:09,560
Any Whalers in chat?

1565
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:12,660
Oh my god, that's a giant-ass hole on that whale.

1566
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:18,120
That's crazy that you can just kill it.

1567
02:05:19,160 --> 02:05:19,820
Look at that hole.

1568
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:20,740
That's not natural.

1569
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:21,880
That's not...

1570
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:24,020
Wait, look at that hole.

1571
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:25,120
That ain't natural.

1572
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:28,260
There's something wrong with that whale.

1573
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:48,960

02:06:08,280 --> 02:06:09,840
Seems they've secured Tartuga!

1578
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:12,060
You think they'll be friendly to us?

1579
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:13,920
Yeah, because it's like the...

1580
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:14,300
What was it?

1581
02:06:14,420 --> 02:06:14,920
The pressure?

1582
02:06:17,060 --> 02:06:19,400
The pressure of, like, the...

1583
02:06:19,400 --> 02:06:22,340
Because a whale's body isn't supposed to be...

1584
02:06:22,340 --> 02:06:26,240
Oh, because, like, apparently if you die, like...

1585
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:28,380
If you leave the body out...

1586
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:32,120
Uh, yeah, the, the, the gases, yeah.

1587
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:38,100
If you die and, like, your body is just left out, the gases will make you just fucking explode.

1588
02:06:45,190 --> 02:06:46,630
It's like, kablooey.

1589
02:06:47,930 --> 02:06:49,930

1591
02:06:51,090 --> 02:06:52,550

1600
02:07:39,630 --> 02:07:40,310
Tortuga.

1601
02:07:40,550 --> 02:07:43,730
While you continue on to skull a pilot.

1602
02:07:44,490 --> 02:07:46,250
Talk to Starkey before you leave.

1603
02:07:46,430 --> 02:07:47,470
Which one's Starkey?

1604
02:07:49,190 --> 02:07:50,250
Oh, listen.

1605
02:07:50,430 --> 02:07:51,950
Taking out the spider maintenance.

02:07:52,350 --> 02:07:52,590
Wait.

1607
02:07:52,710 --> 02:07:53,950
The friends I made?

1608
02:07:54,650 --> 02:07:54,950
Wait.

1609
02:07:55,090 --> 02:07:56,550
They killed my friends.

1610
02:07:58,450 --> 02:07:58,750
Oh.

1611
02:07:58,750 --> 02:07:59,830
That's true.

1612
02:07:59,930 --> 02:08:00,970
Put some comfort.

1613
02:08:03,950 --> 02:08:05,730
It'll be a little surprise.

1614
02:08:05,930 --> 02:08:08,470
The last surprise for your family and friends.

1615
02:08:17,490 --> 02:08:20,050
Like a little party popper.

1616
02:08:21,030 --> 02:08:22,070
One last surprise.

1617
02:08:25,130 --> 02:08:28,050
And push the beetle works down to the docks.

1618
02:08:28,830 --> 02:08:30,890
May you disintegrate yourself.

1619
02:08:30,990 --> 02:08:32,550
as someone to be reckoned with.

1620
02:08:33,150 --> 02:08:35,010
I'm making you an honorary pirate.

1621
02:08:35,810 --> 02:08:37,930
Don't ever see this coming.

1622
02:08:38,430 --> 02:08:40,850
Like, listen, any pirate will know you've earned it.

1623
02:08:40,990 --> 02:08:42,610
Yay, I got the pirate pin.

1624
02:08:43,290 --> 02:08:45,250
I'm an honorary pirate now.

1625
02:08:47,710 --> 02:08:49,730
You want to enter the pirate voyage?

1626
02:08:55,900 --> 02:08:56,340
Yay!

1627
02:08:59,940 --> 02:09:01,180
Wait, was there anything up here?

1628
02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:01,980
I knew it.

1629
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:03,540
There's always like a secret in the back.

1630
02:09:04,220 --> 02:09:05,300
Oh, it was just $20.

1631
02:09:05,820 --> 02:09:07,540
I mean, that's a good secret, actually.

1632
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:08,660
$20?

1633
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:15,640
It'd be nice if I just, like, walk backwards and get a free 20.

1634
02:09:20,270 --> 02:09:21,410
Don't actually do that.

1635
02:09:21,470 --> 02:09:23,070
I think that might be traumatizing.

1636
02:09:26,910 --> 02:09:27,550
I don't know.

1637
02:09:27,650 --> 02:09:27,870
I don't know.

1638
02:09:27,870 --> 02:09:32,590
I feel like some of you of your family and friends might not like that if you just happen to explode confetti.

1639
02:09:34,130 --> 02:09:36,370
I didn't know what...

1640
02:09:38,310 --> 02:09:39,610
Not sure it is.

1641
02:09:39,770 --> 02:09:41,990
I mean, someone can test my theory up.

1642
02:09:43,670 --> 02:09:44,990
Oh, mate!

1643
02:09:46,770 --> 02:09:47,770
You think?

1644
02:09:51,430 --> 02:09:52,870
Alright, let's...

1645
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:53,210
Alright.

1646
02:09:55,510 --> 02:09:56,670
Okay, I got it.

1647
02:09:57,630 --> 02:09:59,850
Do not try this at home.

1648
02:10:04,090 --> 02:10:05,010
Let's see.

1649
02:10:05,230 --> 02:10:06,170
Go this way.

1650
02:10:10,230 --> 02:10:12,010
Just don't use your corpse.

1651
02:10:12,370 --> 02:10:13,170
Maybe like...

1652
02:10:13,170 --> 02:10:15,430
I'm doing such a real...

1653
02:10:15,430 --> 02:10:16,730
Oh shit, I'm about to die.

1654
02:10:18,770 --> 02:10:19,310
That...

1655
02:10:19,310 --> 02:10:20,570
Like, in your will.

1656
02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:22,850
You're like, put in...

1657
02:10:22,850 --> 02:10:23,950
Put, like, a...

1658
02:10:23,950 --> 02:10:26,790
Use the body of a pig in my...

1659
02:10:27,370 --> 02:10:27,910
Uh...

1660
02:10:27,910 --> 02:10:28,730
Oh shit!

1661
02:10:28,890 --> 02:10:29,290
No!

1662
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:31,470
Is it...

1663
02:10:31,470 --> 02:10:36,290
No, like, like, you know, a body of a pig in my...

1664
02:10:36,290 --> 02:10:37,130
What are they called?

1665
02:10:37,970 --> 02:10:38,510

That's so messed up.

1668
02:11:14,250 --> 02:11:16,270
I mean, it's better than using your own body.

1669
02:11:19,410 --> 02:11:20,010
Good luck.

1670
02:11:20,610 --> 02:11:21,550
Last surprise.

1671
02:11:25,310 --> 02:11:26,830
Okay, gotta grab this sketch.

1672
02:11:27,870 --> 02:11:29,110
I don't need that $20.

1673
02:11:31,490 --> 02:11:34,170
Do I can't give real life advice?

1674
02:11:36,710 --> 02:11:37,670
Oh wait, what's over there?

1675
02:11:37,930 --> 02:11:38,930
Wait, there's something over there.

1676
02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:42,030
Maybe it's something that's not $20.

1677
02:11:47,480 --> 02:11:48,500
But don't, but don't.

1678
02:11:50,820 --> 02:11:51,640
What's over here?

1679
02:11:51,980 --> 02:11:52,640
Oh, it's a film.

1680
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:55,620
Nice.

1681
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:01,680
Alright.

1682
02:12:02,100 --> 02:12:03,020
We gotta go back.

1683
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:07,120
This is time to go to Tortuga!

1684
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:15,120
Tortuga time!

1685
02:12:17,380 --> 02:12:18,800
Wait, this isn't Tortuga?

1686
02:12:19,660 --> 02:12:20,920
Why am I jailed?

1687
02:12:21,320 --> 02:12:22,660
I've committed no crime.

1688
02:12:25,620 --> 02:12:28,160
It's not a crime when it hasn't happened yet, guys.

1689
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:30,940
You can't be like, yes, you did, Doki.

1690
02:12:31,380 --> 02:12:34,760
It isn't a crime if everything I say is just hypothetical.

1691
02:12:36,660 --> 02:12:39,940
Oh, I get jailed for a mere thought?

1692
02:12:40,680 --> 02:12:45,360
A lot of things happen.

1693
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:49,240
You can't jail me when I'm just thinking about it.

1694
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:51,800
Is it like a conspiracy?

1695
02:13:00,890 --> 02:13:03,290
I thought we live in a free country!

1696
02:13:06,810 --> 02:13:08,750
They're called thought crimes.

1697
02:13:10,750 --> 02:13:12,390
I still don't even see my room brew.

1698
02:13:12,710 --> 02:13:15,790
Three pumps installed along the river, but let me see one of them.

1699
02:13:16,470 --> 02:13:19,650
Whenever they are, I want to fill them all up to get the ride working properly.

1700
02:13:20,110 --> 02:13:20,370
Okay.

1701
02:13:23,430 --> 02:13:27,210
I did nothing It's not a crime

1702
02:13:31,320 --> 02:13:35,000
So then we get the red Working properly Okay why is this on fire?

1703
02:13:36,580 --> 02:13:39,120
I'm literally throwing paint on it Why isn't it working?

1704
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:54,340
Okay Oh I just have to do this There you go I did it I fixed the world Oh there's Here Here Free country, she says.

1705
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:56,520
Candace also free.

1706
02:13:56,780 --> 02:13:58,580
Our home and native land.

1707
02:13:59,620 --> 02:14:00,960
Cool patron up.

1708
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:07,840
America's not the only free country.

1709
02:14:08,780 --> 02:14:10,900
Like, what do you mean?

1710
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:13,780
You're like, she says this as she's Canadian.

1711
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:16,780
Yes, because we also have laws.

1712
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:20,400
We also have freedom of speech.

1713
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:22,500
You're not the only country.

1714
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:24,600
That has freedom, the speech!

1715
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:25,480
You're-

1716
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:31,820
That's fucking crazy.

1717
02:14:35,180 --> 02:14:35,740
Like...

1718
02:14:36,700 --> 02:14:38,540
God, that has laws.

1719
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:42,520
What the fuck is our RCMP doing if we don't have laws?

1720
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:44,280
You're right, nothing.

1721
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:46,120
To be fair, RCMP does jack shit.

1722
02:14:46,300 --> 02:14:47,640
They just ride on their horses.

1723
02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:52,060
That's a good joke.

1724
02:14:59,540 --> 02:15:01,320
Let's see, we gotta go this way.

1725
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:01,840
Can I?

1726
02:15:02,860 --> 02:15:03,620
Okay, I knew it.

1727
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:05,530
All right, time to paint it.

1728
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:09,560
She's shaming the Mounties.

1729
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:16,100
I would say the Mounties is literally just the status symbol.

1730
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:18,580
I don't think they had...

1731
02:15:18,580 --> 02:15:19,960
Do they actually do anything?

1732
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:22,820
Okay.

1733
02:15:25,880 --> 02:15:26,380
Okay.

1734
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:31,400
One more, and I'll go.

1735
02:15:31,580 --> 02:15:32,700
Okay, we need one more.

1736
02:15:34,240 --> 02:15:37,060
So I'll make sure there's nothing fucking hiding under there.

1737
02:15:39,820 --> 02:15:40,680
Oh, it's over there.

1738
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:41,660
Oh, shit.

1739
02:15:41,880 --> 02:15:42,060
Whoops.

1740
02:15:42,480 --> 02:15:43,060
Oh, shit!

1741
02:15:43,420 --> 02:15:44,320
Oh, no, this is bad.

1742
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:46,040
Oh, my.

1743
02:15:46,540 --> 02:15:47,400
I can live.

1744
02:15:48,740 --> 02:15:49,040
Yeah.

1745
02:15:49,940 --> 02:15:50,700
Partnership beam.

1746
02:15:53,260 --> 02:15:54,760
No, we have our own FBI.

1747
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:56,160
I don't remember what it's called, though.

1748
02:15:56,480 --> 02:15:57,360
That's his own name.

1749
02:15:58,380 --> 02:16:52,790
I also unpaint this and then the door I fucking knew it I've learned from last time you know this works all right how am I sure I there's no random daisy parts lying about I know we have the FBI like the Canadian version of the FBI but I don't remember what it's called why can they even still have the bounty police because it's just like it's just funny that they're riding their little horseies around it's like a little what's over here oh it's on fire why is it on fire what if i just paint it better wait how do i guys how do i get it not on fire that doesn't sound good Wait,

1750
02:16:52,950 --> 02:16:53,910
it's just on fire.

1751
02:16:54,130 --> 02:16:54,930
How do I...

1752
02:16:54,930 --> 02:16:56,910
How do I fix that?

1753
02:17:00,330 --> 02:17:01,150
Guys, that's what...

1754
02:17:01,150 --> 02:17:01,730
The pipe.

1755
02:17:02,230 --> 02:17:03,150
I just break it?

1756
02:17:03,930 --> 02:17:06,390
Yeah, but it doesn't unbain itself.

1757
02:17:07,010 --> 02:17:07,750
Oh, there it is.

1758
02:17:08,970 --> 02:17:10,330
Oh, I didn't see the band-aid.

1759
02:17:12,650 --> 02:17:14,030
I could just blow on it.

1760
02:17:14,950 --> 02:17:16,690
RBI is the RCMP?

1761
02:17:21,150 --> 02:17:22,630
So you can take funny photos.

1762
02:17:22,650 --> 02:17:24,610
with the Mounties.

1763
02:17:26,590 --> 02:17:30,850
That's all I'm gonna say, like, that red is not camouflaging anything.

1764
02:17:31,190 --> 02:17:35,090
To be fair, the horse is not, and I think when you see a horse fucking coming at you, you know they're coming.

1765
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:39,530
Am I missing anything?

1766
02:17:40,250 --> 02:17:40,950
No, right?

1767
02:17:41,990 --> 02:17:44,950
Because you don't know if I'm, like...

1768
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:49,240
I don't know if I'm missing anything.

1769
02:17:52,820 --> 02:17:55,400
Because in the entire world, there's, like, secrets everywhere.

1770
02:17:56,440 --> 02:17:57,180
I don't think I am.

1771
02:17:57,220 --> 02:17:58,180
I'm gonna go straight here.

1772
02:17:59,660 --> 02:18:00,720
I'm gonna straight in.

1773
02:18:02,080 --> 02:18:03,440
I don't think I'm missing anything.

1774
02:18:03,580 --> 02:18:04,740
Oh, I got free the pirates!

1775
02:18:06,300 --> 02:18:07,920
Don't worry, I'm- I'm a hero!

1776
02:18:10,840 --> 02:18:12,660
What the fuck did I free?

1777
02:18:13,300 --> 02:18:16,660
Oh, I have to free all- oh, I have to do all of the levers.

1778
02:18:19,880 --> 02:18:22,020
Oh yeah, you're right, they're for the parades too.

1779
02:18:24,780 --> 02:18:26,020
All right, I freed all of you.

1780
02:18:26,440 --> 02:18:27,160
I'm a hero!

1781
02:18:34,320 --> 02:18:39,620
I don't know if I didn't give you this reward, but I'm supposed to free a fellow uh, Rigger Green.

1782
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:41,660
He's laughing at Rome for treasure.

1783
02:18:41,800 --> 02:18:42,800
Maybe I'll share with you.

1784
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:45,980
You see, I've been a trap to capture some of Hook's mechanical parts.

1785
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:47,960
So a fellow Green stumbled into it.

1786
02:18:48,260 --> 02:18:49,260
That's where I'm headed.

1787
02:18:49,680 --> 02:18:52,300
When Hook's mechanical goon stuffed me in that cage.

1788
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:53,720
Oh, there he is.

1789
02:18:53,800 --> 02:18:54,520
Now he's freed.

1790
02:18:56,100 --> 02:18:57,360
See, I'm lawful good.

1791
02:18:58,260 --> 02:18:59,180
This proves it.

1792
02:19:02,860 --> 02:19:03,760
How do I?

1793
02:19:03,960 --> 02:19:05,440
I forgot how to use the...

1794
02:19:08,500 --> 02:19:08,940
Oops.

1795
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:10,300
That's not what I wanted to do.

1796
02:19:10,740 --> 02:19:13,880
How do I use my little blaster thing again?

1797
02:19:14,700 --> 02:19:15,080
Whoa!

1798
02:19:20,370 --> 02:19:22,730
Guys, do you guys remember how to use the blaster thing?

1799
02:19:24,110 --> 02:19:24,990
With the...

1800
02:19:24,990 --> 02:19:26,890
You see how I have three of these guys there?

1801
02:19:28,230 --> 02:19:29,410
How do I use it again?

1802
02:19:30,030 --> 02:19:30,790
I don't remember.

1803
02:19:30,970 --> 02:19:32,450
Wait, maybe I have my options.

1804
02:19:34,370 --> 02:19:35,230
Game setting.

1805
02:19:38,970 --> 02:19:39,630
Uh...

1806
02:19:39,630 --> 02:19:41,750
Where the fuck is the...

1807
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:43,450
Where the fuck are the controllers?

1808
02:19:45,170 --> 02:19:46,490
I'm just...

1809
02:19:47,470 --> 02:19:48,790
Yeah, the...

1810
02:19:48,790 --> 02:19:50,690
Yeah, the blue lights thing.

1811
02:19:52,390 --> 02:19:55,330
I'm trying to figure out how to use the blue thingy.

1812
02:19:56,270 --> 02:19:58,210
Just steal yourself real fast.

1813
02:20:04,260 --> 02:20:05,720
Yeah, silver pin!

1814
02:20:07,660 --> 02:20:10,240
You see these little blue lights following me?

1815
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:13,900
You're supposed to be able to use it, but I don't remember how to use it.

1816
02:20:15,480 --> 02:20:17,380
I just keep putting TVs down.

1817
02:20:21,540 --> 02:20:23,540
I just keep putting TVs down.

1818
02:20:24,180 --> 02:20:25,060
I'm on a controller.

1819
02:20:28,440 --> 02:20:29,120
Enjoy the loot.

1820
02:20:29,360 --> 02:20:34,020
I guess I'll do some boat hopping back once I get my sea legs back.

1821
02:20:35,380 --> 02:20:36,100
Pretty nice.

1822
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:41,180
Why don't I open that door though?

1823
02:20:41,880 --> 02:20:43,040
Why is that door not opening?

1824
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:44,260
Hello?

1825
02:20:48,130 --> 02:20:48,730
Just unpainted.

1826
02:20:48,870 --> 02:20:49,670
Oh, I just unpainted.

1827
02:20:49,950 --> 02:20:50,830
Okay, alright.

1828
02:20:51,970 --> 02:20:53,670
That doesn't seem very...

1829
02:20:54,950 --> 02:20:57,070
That doesn't seem like good security.

1830
02:20:59,530 --> 02:21:00,610
Oh, check input settings.

1831
02:21:00,750 --> 02:21:01,430
Where is the input?

1832
02:21:06,410 --> 02:21:07,450
Game settings.

1833
02:21:09,170 --> 02:21:10,930
There's no input settings, yeah?

1834
02:21:14,550 --> 02:21:16,590
What is my graphic?

1835
02:21:16,710 --> 02:21:17,470
Oh, it's epic.

1836
02:21:22,370 --> 02:21:23,510
There is?

1837
02:21:23,870 --> 02:21:25,030
Where is it?

1838
02:21:29,670 --> 02:21:30,930
Downward says...

1839
02:21:30,930 --> 02:21:31,210
Oh!

1840
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:38,360
Oh, it's RB!

1841
02:21:40,780 --> 02:21:41,320
It's RB.

1842
02:21:42,980 --> 02:21:43,340
Friend.

1843
02:21:43,880 --> 02:21:44,200
Friend.

1844
02:21:45,260 --> 02:21:45,840
There you go.

1845
02:21:46,720 --> 02:21:48,060
I'm a bit blind.

1846
02:21:51,160 --> 02:21:53,220
Just a little bit.

1847
02:21:56,110 --> 02:21:58,150
Okay, no one looks at the very bottom.

1848
02:21:58,330 --> 02:22:00,470
That's why nobody reads the terms of service.

1849
02:22:05,090 --> 02:22:05,690
Friend.

1850
02:22:07,470 --> 02:22:09,230
My friend attack.

1851
02:22:13,110 --> 02:22:13,330
Yeah.

1852
02:22:17,010 --> 02:22:17,550
Friend!

1853
02:22:19,470 --> 02:22:20,230
Okay, nice.

1854
02:22:21,650 --> 02:22:22,290
That's right.

1855
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:26,910
I break in so I can force you to be my friend.

1856
02:22:28,210 --> 02:22:57,130
like all good friends do oh what's the point of forcing friendship on them all right and i'll go aggressive friending exactly they don't know that it's actually a good thing for them being my friend i wasn't yeah oh nothing what's going on what's going on Hey,

1857
02:22:57,210 --> 02:22:57,770
there's Pete!

1858
02:23:01,150 --> 02:23:01,990
Which way do I have to go?

1859
02:23:02,150 --> 02:23:03,410
That's the right way.

1860
02:23:03,550 --> 02:23:04,210
Oh, it's up.

1861
02:23:04,910 --> 02:23:06,330
The right way is always up.

1862
02:23:07,490 --> 02:23:08,530
Wait, is he a bad guy?

1863
02:23:08,650 --> 02:23:09,250
Oh, he was.

1864
02:23:09,570 --> 02:23:11,030
Wait, no, he didn't hurt me.

1865
02:23:13,050 --> 02:23:13,990
Oh, is this a shortcut?

1866
02:23:15,310 --> 02:23:16,110
I knew it.

1867
02:23:16,970 --> 02:23:19,510
I saw fireworks that I knew it was a shortcut.

1868
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,840
Am I care enough to get the films?

1869
02:23:27,180 --> 02:23:27,900
I do.

1870
02:23:29,180 --> 02:23:38,060
Like, I'm like, I'm doing, like, things where I, like, it's, like, sort of a completionist, but, like, I, like, half-ass it.

1871
02:23:40,880 --> 02:23:43,300
It's not even, like, the full completionist.

1872
02:23:43,380 --> 02:23:45,680
I do, like, 50% of it.

1873
02:23:45,740 --> 02:23:46,980
I'm, like, that's good enough.

1874
02:23:50,080 --> 02:23:51,860
Like, I might as well not do it.

1875
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:54,460
I'm like, you know, no, I made an attempt, you know?

1876
02:23:54,540 --> 02:23:55,320
I tried.

1877
02:23:56,220 --> 02:23:58,580
Like, 93% completion.

1878
02:24:01,080 --> 02:24:02,940
But I didn't have to get this.

1879
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:05,660
Is there anything more?

1880
02:24:07,100 --> 02:24:08,920
Only completing half of it.

1881
02:24:09,220 --> 02:24:11,360
Look, at least I made an effort.

1882
02:24:11,700 --> 02:24:12,760
See, look, look at that.

1883
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:15,240
Chang hide.

1884
02:24:19,660 --> 02:24:20,840
Okay, we go this way.

1885
02:24:21,240 --> 02:24:22,500
How do I...

1886
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:26,480
This one?

1887
02:24:26,780 --> 02:24:28,520
No, that's not even part of it.

1888
02:24:28,600 --> 02:24:29,240
What the fuck?

1889
02:24:30,620 --> 02:24:31,820
What is that even for?

1890
02:24:35,750 --> 02:24:39,710
Oh my god I give up I'm fucking shortcut Shortcut

1891
02:24:43,350 --> 02:25:15,150
I can't even bother to parkour that I need my baby's first parkour clouds Alright nice I made it Yay Blue sky do Here I go I wanted to play Dora I want to play a Dora the Explorer game, but then they're all like I have to like get like an like what are they called?

1892
02:25:16,470 --> 02:25:20,810
I have to like emulate it because they're all like the CD-ROM games.

1893
02:25:22,890 --> 02:25:26,330
The boat bears a red flag and we can use it to reach hook.

1894
02:25:26,490 --> 02:25:29,570
That's it, but it looks like anchor lines are keeping it submerged.

1895
02:25:30,250 --> 02:25:32,110
We'll have to locate the anchors and cut them loose.

1896
02:25:32,510 --> 02:25:39,190
And then like, okay, I swear to God, like PC The PC emulation is so fucking confusing.

1897
02:25:39,570 --> 02:25:43,430
Because you have to, like, pretend you have to, like, fake your PC settings.

1898
02:25:44,030 --> 02:25:47,470
Into, like, as if it's, like, Windows XP or some shit.

1899
02:25:48,430 --> 02:25:49,690
And then I give up.

1900
02:25:51,290 --> 02:25:52,610
Hola, soy, yora.

1901
02:25:55,510 --> 02:25:58,850
The boat bears a red flag, and we can use it to reach hook.

1902
02:25:59,390 --> 02:25:59,970
That's it.

1903
02:26:00,050 --> 02:26:02,910
But looks like the anchor lines are keeping it submerged.

1904
02:26:03,470 --> 02:26:03,970
Okay.

1905
02:26:05,990 --> 02:26:10,150
Because I wanted to play the Blues Clues Birthday Treasure Hunt game.

1906
02:26:10,830 --> 02:26:13,370
Because that was a game I grew up with.

1907
02:26:15,830 --> 02:26:19,850
But then, like, every time I try to look up how to do it, I try to, like, look up how to do it.

1908
02:26:20,910 --> 02:26:21,310
Um...

1909
02:26:22,750 --> 02:26:27,170
Um, and it was, like, so difficult to try and get that to work.

1910
02:26:29,070 --> 02:26:32,090
I realized, like, a lot of PCs don't even have, like, disc...

1911
02:26:32,090 --> 02:26:33,890
Like, those, like, disc readers anymore.

1912
02:26:33,890 --> 02:26:36,250
You guys notice that?

1913
02:26:37,030 --> 02:26:38,390
Because everything is digital now.

1914
02:26:38,570 --> 02:26:40,310
We don't use CDs anymore.

1915
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:50,060
Yeah, we don't like...

1916
02:26:50,060 --> 02:26:51,660
We don't put CDs in.

1917
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:53,800
They all use digital or USB now.

1918
02:26:55,120 --> 02:26:57,200
So we don't have our cup holders anymore.

1919
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:04,600
No, what's gonna hold my cups?

1920
02:27:04,880 --> 02:27:05,620
Wait, what?

1921
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:08,240
How am I gonna hold my cup now?

1922
02:27:15,620 --> 02:27:16,820
Get naked.

1923
02:27:18,700 --> 02:27:19,900
Robot, man.

1924
02:27:24,900 --> 02:27:25,660
Whoa, Joki.

1925
02:27:25,880 --> 02:27:27,900
Why did you tell this robot to get naked?

1926
02:27:28,020 --> 02:27:29,920
Look, it's for his own good.

1927
02:27:33,550 --> 02:27:34,390
Get naked.

1928
02:27:35,010 --> 02:27:36,150
Taking off his gun.

1929
02:27:36,550 --> 02:27:37,170
Look at that.

1930
02:27:41,110 --> 02:27:42,430
Okay, there you go.

1931
02:27:43,390 --> 02:27:45,330
I got TV out of it.

1932
02:27:50,320 --> 02:27:53,180
It's time to strip that robot!

1933
02:27:55,240 --> 02:27:58,700
I think like each world is like takes longer and longer too.

1934
02:28:01,440 --> 02:28:03,980
Parsing machine reversing, you're on the right track.

1935
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:06,940
Since you started with paint, you should use it on the rest as well.

1936
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:08,980
See, I'm a good person.

1937
02:28:09,820 --> 02:28:11,300
I'm not destroying their land.

1938
02:28:14,220 --> 02:28:22,600
ship now we gotta make sure he oh shit my friend don't worry i'm stripping the robot

1939
02:28:26,930 --> 02:28:34,910
oh shit friend okay don't worry he's gonna put his clothes back on and then we'll take them off

1940
02:28:38,450 --> 02:28:47,450
there you go oh shit okay i didn't fully take it off that's my bad There we go.

1941
02:28:49,850 --> 02:28:50,870
Your friend.

1942
02:28:52,630 --> 02:28:53,710
Yeah, friendship.

1943
02:28:57,090 --> 02:28:59,170
This place is big.

1944
02:29:00,330 --> 02:29:01,970
It's a little confusing, to be fair.

1945
02:29:05,050 --> 02:29:06,110
Take it off!

1946
02:29:08,350 --> 02:29:10,090
I say that to all my friends.

1947
02:29:17,420 --> 02:29:19,620
Beware of the robot stripper!

1948
02:29:22,600 --> 02:29:23,680
Tokey, please.

1949
02:29:28,240 --> 02:29:30,320
Alright, let's get through this door.

1950
02:29:33,080 --> 02:29:35,060
Actually, what am I doing up here?

1951
02:29:35,940 --> 02:29:36,880
Oh, for this.

1952
02:29:39,940 --> 02:29:41,060
The fuck let me out!

1953
02:29:41,960 --> 02:29:42,540
There you go.

1954
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:45,280
What am I doing up here?

1955
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:46,560
What is up here?

1956
02:29:47,400 --> 02:29:48,080
The wheel.

1957
02:29:49,420 --> 02:29:50,400
What does that do, though?

1958
02:29:51,960 --> 02:29:52,760
Oh, hey, TV!

1959
02:29:54,200 --> 02:29:55,080
TV time.

1960
02:29:57,020 --> 02:29:57,900
Never mind.

1961
02:29:58,260 --> 02:29:58,400
Oh.

1962
02:29:59,860 --> 02:30:01,060
Where am I?

1963
02:30:01,140 --> 02:30:03,520
Like, what the fuck am I doing here?

1964
02:30:07,820 --> 02:30:08,460
Alright.

1965
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:12,080
Like, what?

1966
02:30:12,600 --> 02:30:13,260
Whoops, sorry.

1967
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:14,840
Oh, this way.

1968
02:30:15,060 --> 02:30:15,900
Oh, there it is.

1969
02:30:20,700 --> 02:30:21,340
Yay.

1970
02:30:23,560 --> 02:30:24,580
Wait, I didn't.

1971
02:30:25,400 --> 02:30:26,560
Darwin, thank you for the super chat.

1972
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:27,360
Thank you, thank you.

1973
02:30:27,420 --> 02:30:33,100
There's nothing to do with the stream, but I bought a dokeybird happy to go to the Ato concert.

1974
02:30:33,420 --> 02:30:33,800
Ato concert?

1975
02:30:34,620 --> 02:30:34,960
Oh, wait.

1976
02:30:35,180 --> 02:30:35,860
What the fuck?

1977
02:30:36,020 --> 02:30:36,900
They're back to back?

1978
02:30:39,240 --> 02:30:42,120
One more paint and we'll start all those who are transformed by it.

1979
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:44,060
And a concert is already passed.

1980
02:30:44,140 --> 02:30:44,800
Should I use it for...

1981
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:45,580
Yeah, of course.

1982
02:30:46,240 --> 02:30:46,640
Of course.

1983
02:30:47,380 --> 02:30:48,740
You can wear it whenever you want.

1984
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:51,120
Take it with you everywhere.

1985
02:30:53,940 --> 02:31:03,160
I'm glad they ride They ride pretty fast, though I didn't give them the super chat Oh my god, speaking of Ato Ato, how do you pronounce it?

1986
02:31:03,340 --> 02:31:03,520
Ato?

1987
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:04,440
Or Ato?

1988
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:04,980
Ato?

1989
02:31:07,580 --> 02:31:10,720
There are red flags Of sneer around everyone?

1990
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:14,240
Where the fuck is this red flag That they're talking about?

1991
02:31:18,140 --> 02:31:39,460
But like, I don't know if you guys remember this which one is the one that's not my friend try to figure out which one's not my friend is it the one where oh it's a no wait they're fighting each other wait how do i know if they're friend or not they're all blue

1992
02:31:42,860 --> 02:32:24,740
i don't pronounce eight odd um there was that there was this tweet from auto where um I don't remember which state it was, but like there was nothing there wasn't really anything exciting So she went to a grocery store and then took a picture of a cake at a grocery store I don't know if anyone saw that tweet There was like nothing There was nothing to tweet of there was nothing to tweet about That was fucking hilarious I mean,

1993
02:32:24,880 --> 02:32:25,940
there's the anchor right there.

1994
02:32:26,060 --> 02:32:27,040
How do I get there?

1995
02:32:30,360 --> 02:32:31,620
Wasn't New Jersey?

1996
02:32:33,700 --> 02:32:35,280
Because she was tweeting, like, tourist.

1997
02:32:35,540 --> 02:32:40,000
The funny thing was that for all the other states, she was tweeting, like, super touristy spots.

1998
02:32:40,340 --> 02:32:40,940
But it was...

1999
02:32:40,940 --> 02:32:46,120
It was literally, for some reason, that particular place.

2000
02:32:46,280 --> 02:32:47,220
She just...

2001
02:32:47,220 --> 02:32:50,300
She just didn't know, like, what the...

2002
02:32:50,300 --> 02:32:51,360
What the tweet about?

tour.

2005
02:33:33,180 --> 02:33:35,420
Maybe it was a really good cake.

2006
02:33:35,980 --> 02:33:37,620
Guys, it was a grocery cake.

2007
02:33:37,820 --> 02:33:40,500
It was a really, really good cake.

2008
02:33:41,860 --> 02:33:50,080
To be fair, a lot of decorators, they just buy, they either buy grocery cakes or they use like, what's a cake mix.

2009
02:33:50,500 --> 02:33:52,500
And then they just decorate it really nice.

2010
02:33:53,100 --> 02:33:54,720
It's a little hack.

2011
02:33:55,640 --> 02:33:57,440
It's because you're really just...

2012
02:33:59,440 --> 02:34:05,560
You're really paying for, uh, um, a lot of, like, cake makers, like, cake decorators.

2013
02:34:05,800 --> 02:34:08,400
They were just, like, buy a grocery cake and decorate it.

2014
02:34:12,430 --> 02:34:14,210
Yeah, it's mainly just for the look.

2015
02:34:16,650 --> 02:34:17,890
Yeah, why don't we waste time?

2016
02:34:19,450 --> 02:34:21,430
Why do we waste time making a cake from scratch?

2017
02:34:21,730 --> 02:34:27,670
Also, like, wedding cakes in general are, like, mostly just cardboard.

2018
02:34:30,210 --> 02:34:30,910
about it.

2019
02:34:33,470 --> 02:34:38,750
It's literally like they look really big and tall but it's just one layer that you could cut.

2020
02:34:42,720 --> 02:34:43,140
That's right.

2021
02:34:43,260 --> 02:34:44,420
We ameka you.

2022
02:34:44,860 --> 02:34:46,500
You're gonna be less cool now.

2023
02:34:51,710 --> 02:34:54,250
Yeah, they use cardboard with frosting.

2024
02:34:55,090 --> 02:34:56,030
But why are they happy?

2025
02:34:56,430 --> 02:34:57,670
They were so cool before.

2026
02:35:00,790 --> 02:35:03,430
The machine is turning monsters back into pirates.

2027
02:35:03,590 --> 02:35:31,770
Hey, robots have rights that can't be made better with some paint oh yeah it's fondant and and um it's usually just fondant or wait what's over there oh it's the anchor it's usually just fondant and uh cardboard and then it's like one layer that's actual cake that you cut they would like mark the area where like,

2028
02:35:31,930 --> 02:35:34,430
oh, it's for the bride and the groom to cut it.

2029
02:35:35,690 --> 02:35:37,350
To be like, this is the real kick.

2030
02:35:38,590 --> 02:35:40,450
Remember to cut this part.

2031
02:35:42,830 --> 02:35:51,850
Doki takes away rights from mutants and animals elves, but gives rights um, okay, you cannot be defending elves right now.

2032
02:35:52,030 --> 02:35:55,470
If anybody is, like, extra racist, it's elves.

2033
02:35:55,810 --> 02:36:00,370
Like, there is no way you're defending elves.

2034
02:36:08,140 --> 02:36:10,220
All right, nice.

2035
02:36:10,440 --> 02:36:12,240
I mean, that's true.

2036
02:36:12,640 --> 02:36:14,560
She has a point.

2037
02:36:23,930 --> 02:36:25,250
Yeah, what's the point?

2038
02:36:27,570 --> 02:36:30,690
There's no fucking way you're defending elves.

2039
02:36:32,670 --> 02:36:35,830
When they hate everything but elves.

2040
02:36:36,250 --> 02:36:38,070
They even hate other elves.

2041
02:36:38,530 --> 02:36:39,490
Like, what the fuck are you?

2042
02:36:41,390 --> 02:36:46,210
They even hate other elves because they're not the right elf.

2043
02:36:51,560 --> 02:36:55,920
There's no way you're comparing me to an elf right now.

2044
02:36:57,760 --> 02:36:59,460
Go back to the north.

2045
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:05,040
All right, that's another ear.

2046
02:37:05,460 --> 02:37:07,940
Get those knife ears out of here.

2047
02:37:08,360 --> 02:37:10,080
Menace, thank you for the super chat.

2048
02:37:10,380 --> 02:37:11,140
Thank you, thank you.

2049
02:37:12,860 --> 02:37:13,340
No.

2050
02:37:15,080 --> 02:37:16,940
Alright, let's make sure he's my friend.

2051
02:37:25,810 --> 02:37:26,450
Here's a knife.

2052
02:37:26,530 --> 02:37:27,490
No, no, I'm different.

2053
02:37:27,550 --> 02:37:28,110
I'm a bird.

2054
02:37:28,450 --> 02:37:29,230
I'm Doki bird.

2055
02:37:29,530 --> 02:37:30,510
I'm not Doki elf.

2056
02:37:32,890 --> 02:37:34,990
And now we can go after me.

2057
02:37:35,410 --> 02:37:36,910
Go after Captain Hook.

2058
02:37:37,630 --> 02:37:38,610
And there's a guy right there.

2059
02:37:38,710 --> 02:37:39,790
He's just chilling there.

2060
02:37:40,570 --> 02:37:41,590
You see that guy there?

2061
02:37:42,230 --> 02:37:43,950
He's just fucking chilling there.

2062
02:37:44,490 --> 02:37:46,070
He's just stranded in the middle.

2063
02:37:46,090 --> 02:38:02,590
of nowhere what the fuck is he defending there's like nothing there buddy like is it worth killing those robots I don't even know what he's trying to defend

2064
02:38:07,310 --> 02:38:23,700
okay maybe there's something up here the stream is sponsored by Lord Goritos and he's Grimard I don't even know what I was supposed to do here

2065
02:38:27,960 --> 02:38:29,300
I think that's everything.

2066
02:38:29,660 --> 02:38:30,820
Alright, we gotta find the boat.

2067
02:38:32,260 --> 02:38:33,100
Wait, what's over here?

2068
02:38:35,100 --> 02:38:36,980
I'd say I don't mind having sawed these for hands.

2069
02:38:37,320 --> 02:38:38,340
Better than it hooked by far.

2070
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:41,160
That's what I'm saying!

2071
02:38:42,020 --> 02:38:44,820
I always like be a non-Mekka.

2072
02:38:47,220 --> 02:38:47,700
Better.

2073
02:38:48,500 --> 02:38:50,480
Where the fuck are these these parts?

2074
02:38:50,640 --> 02:38:51,780
Like, I swear to God.

2075
02:38:51,900 --> 02:38:52,980
Did I got all of them?

2076
02:38:55,660 --> 02:39:06,320
her her feet and her torso where the fuck is her other foot it's like hiding somewhere

2077
02:39:11,390 --> 02:39:25,670
yeah we have one arm and one foot guys you guys know where her other body parts are gotta do this for donald guys

2078
02:39:32,770 --> 02:39:38,810
guys we're doing this for him I have no idea.

2079
02:39:38,950 --> 02:39:40,010
I might give up.

2080
02:39:41,870 --> 02:39:44,310
I have no idea where it is.

2081
02:39:46,950 --> 02:39:48,810
I don't think it's even worth it.

2082
02:39:50,310 --> 02:39:53,210
Wait, no, I have to unlock the good ending, apparently.

2083
02:39:55,150 --> 02:39:55,810
It's alright.

2084
02:39:56,070 --> 02:39:57,710
She has one arm and one foot.

2085
02:39:57,810 --> 02:39:58,690
That's good enough.

2086
02:40:04,880 --> 02:40:06,620
I don't know where it is.

2087
02:40:08,260 --> 02:40:10,260
Daisy, you tell me where it is, chat.

2088
02:40:11,100 --> 02:40:14,140
How the fuck am I supposed to know where it is?

2089
02:40:18,100 --> 02:40:22,300
I asked to be somewhere here, though, I assume, because it's that...

2090
02:40:22,300 --> 02:40:23,400
It's around the way...

2091
02:40:23,400 --> 02:40:24,680
Around here.

2092
02:40:26,340 --> 02:40:27,460
Oh, I haven't been here.

2093
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:29,400
He's like, he's mad at me.

2094
02:40:35,130 --> 02:40:38,550
Guys, I worked so hard to try... Oh, okay, no, that's... That it.

2095
02:40:38,910 --> 02:40:39,990
To get the good ending.

2096
02:40:40,070 --> 02:40:41,930
We have to get the good ending at this point.

2097
02:40:42,710 --> 02:40:45,210
I could have killed all those civilians here, but I didn't.

2098
02:40:46,430 --> 02:40:47,710
I had self-restraint.

2099
02:40:47,890 --> 02:40:48,870
Wait, what the fuck?

2100
02:40:50,090 --> 02:40:51,110
What's he doing here?

2101
02:40:51,890 --> 02:40:52,570
Pete Penn?

2102
02:40:52,850 --> 02:40:54,630
Who must be the Mickey Mouse I've been hearing about?

2103
02:40:55,150 --> 02:40:56,030
Of course you know me.

2104
02:40:56,450 --> 02:40:58,470
I was created a challenge with Captain Hook.

2105
02:40:59,030 --> 02:40:59,810
Oh, there's our foot!

2106
02:41:00,690 --> 02:41:02,510
But Hook captured my sprite friend.

2107
02:41:02,630 --> 02:41:03,870
And we're gone, it can't fly.

2108
02:41:04,390 --> 02:41:05,770
That's why I'm trapped here.

2109
02:41:06,130 --> 02:41:09,210
He keeps the sprite tied to the mass of his ship just to Tommy.

2110
02:41:09,730 --> 02:41:13,850
If I don't wait for here, I'll be there in an instant to give hook the what for.

2111
02:41:14,930 --> 02:41:15,510
Wait, what?

2112
02:41:16,510 --> 02:41:17,690
What is a trap?

2113
02:41:19,410 --> 02:41:20,950
Where is it tied up on?

2114
02:41:23,090 --> 02:41:24,730
I don't see the spray.

2115
02:41:26,570 --> 02:41:27,790
What is he saying?

2116
02:41:35,400 --> 02:41:35,800
Wait.

2117
02:41:43,350 --> 02:41:44,850
Restore the pipes.

2118
02:41:45,810 --> 02:41:46,170
Whoops.

2119
02:41:47,630 --> 02:41:52,030
I hope this expired doesn't mean like I fucked up.

2120
02:41:55,450 --> 02:42:01,130
I hope it doesn't mean anything bad.

2121
02:42:01,370 --> 02:42:07,190
I hope it doesn't mean anything bad.

2122
02:42:07,710 --> 02:42:10,950
Uh, that should be okay, right?

2123
02:42:13,510 --> 02:42:21,390
So to summarize, Doki thinks all cows are the same, has a fetish of reverse mermaids, and hates elves.

2124
02:42:22,150 --> 02:42:24,250
Oh, gee, I'm so proud.

2125
02:42:24,770 --> 02:42:25,890
Thank you for the super chat.

2126
02:42:26,570 --> 02:42:28,030
Bacon, thank you, thank you.

2127
02:42:35,590 --> 02:42:38,130
Release that sprite from the mass.

2128
02:42:42,600 --> 02:42:45,100
What the fuck is he talking about?

2129
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:50,940
Like, up here?

2130
02:42:55,290 --> 02:42:56,610
Is that it?

2131
02:42:56,730 --> 02:42:57,290
Over there?

2132
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:03,460
No, that's just a pain.

2133
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:08,140
Where the fuck is it?

2134
02:43:12,250 --> 02:43:15,230
I don't see anything other any other mass stuff.

2135
02:43:19,270 --> 02:43:19,290
Okay.

2136
02:43:20,250 --> 02:43:22,030
Yeah, but where do I release it?

2137
02:43:24,890 --> 02:43:26,230
Oh, it's a later level.

2138
02:43:26,470 --> 02:43:26,690
Okay.

2139
02:43:27,170 --> 02:43:29,270
I'm like, where the fuck is it?

2140
02:43:32,520 --> 02:43:33,380
Is that the good?

2141
02:43:33,540 --> 02:43:35,660
That I had to hook right here.

2142
02:43:36,580 --> 02:43:37,060
Okay.

2143
02:43:37,080 --> 02:43:38,540
It's fine.

2144
02:43:40,340 --> 02:43:41,860
Is it actually a later level?

2145
02:43:44,520 --> 02:43:45,560
Hi, I'm unemployed.

2146
02:43:45,820 --> 02:43:48,000
Should I work at McDonald's or Target?

2147
02:43:48,900 --> 02:43:50,080
I'd say...

2148
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:54,720
I honestly say Target.

2149
02:43:55,740 --> 02:43:57,080
Just because, like...

2150
02:43:58,700 --> 02:43:59,360
Um...

2151
02:43:59,360 --> 02:44:01,580
Just because I feel like fast food customers...

2152
02:44:02,300 --> 02:44:03,200
Dealing with...

2153
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:04,920
In fast food field...

2154
02:44:04,920 --> 02:44:06,400
Is, like, more pressure.

2155
02:44:07,540 --> 02:44:08,740
than dealing in.

2156
02:44:08,880 --> 02:44:11,520
No, actually, they're both bad, because one is retail.

2157
02:44:12,040 --> 02:44:13,260
The other is retail as well.

2158
02:44:13,460 --> 02:44:14,260
Retail is pretty bad.

2159
02:44:14,500 --> 02:44:18,920
Yeah, but I feel like food service is more hellish than retail.

2160
02:44:21,960 --> 02:44:23,540
And target customers are better.

2161
02:44:24,040 --> 02:44:25,520
Okay, but like, it depends.

2162
02:44:25,640 --> 02:44:27,820
Are you a cashier or like a stalker?

2163
02:44:28,320 --> 02:44:31,540
If you just, not the bad type of stalker.

2164
02:44:31,660 --> 02:44:36,000
I mean, like, you're stalking things, like, as in, like, you're putting things on shelves.

2165
02:44:37,080 --> 02:44:39,600
If you're putting things on shelves, you can avoid customers.

2166
02:44:42,580 --> 02:44:47,020
But if you're in the fast food industry, then you can't really avoid them.

2167
02:44:47,660 --> 02:44:52,380
Yeah, if you're just an inventory guy, like, it's not as bad.

2168
02:44:58,650 --> 02:45:01,730
Is this little fucking sprite thing like...

2169
02:45:03,050 --> 02:45:04,990
At the hook, not at this level?

2170
02:45:06,330 --> 02:45:07,710
Yeah, you can...

2171
02:45:07,710 --> 02:45:10,190
Yeah, but you can avoid them more.

2172
02:45:12,030 --> 02:45:14,010
Compared to, like, fast food.

2173
02:45:19,850 --> 02:45:21,130
Take control of this vessel.

2174
02:45:21,550 --> 02:45:21,550
Okay.

2175
02:45:22,410 --> 02:45:22,970
I'm painting.

2176
02:45:23,830 --> 02:45:24,570
I'm painting.

2177
02:45:25,450 --> 02:45:26,090
Is it painted?

2178
02:45:28,050 --> 02:45:29,830
Oh, it's during the boss fight.

2179
02:45:30,030 --> 02:45:30,230
Okay.

2180
02:45:30,470 --> 02:45:32,010
Before I go, I actually need to use the bathroom.

2181
02:45:32,090 --> 02:45:32,850
I'll be right back, guys.

2182
02:46:48,710 --> 02:46:49,730
All right, I'm back.

2183
02:46:50,250 --> 02:46:50,550
Whoa!

2184
02:46:50,950 --> 02:46:52,530
The sensitivity is so high when we're on our mouths.

2185
02:46:53,010 --> 02:46:59,750
Oh, Johnny, Allen, Medi, Champion, Bite, Boer, Rice, Medi, Matthew, thank you for the super chat.

2186
02:46:59,950 --> 02:47:00,030
Thank you.

2187
02:47:00,410 --> 02:47:00,750
Thank you.

2188
02:47:01,710 --> 02:47:02,770
Alright, it's time.

2189
02:47:03,950 --> 02:47:05,810
You sure you want head to the Johnny Roger?

2190
02:47:06,130 --> 02:47:07,150
Yeah, I'm fucking sure.

2191
02:47:07,630 --> 02:47:10,650
I'm pretty sure I'm missing one daisy piece somewhere.

2192
02:47:11,090 --> 02:47:12,710
It's like somewhere in the world.

2193
02:47:13,550 --> 02:47:14,190
I don't fucking know.

2194
02:47:14,330 --> 02:47:15,170
I'm fucking, I swear to God.

2195
02:47:15,410 --> 02:47:17,150
If it makes me look up a guy, I swear to God.

2196
02:47:22,050 --> 02:47:23,230
Alright, let's see.

2197
02:47:23,890 --> 02:47:25,550
Yes, I'm ready to leave.

2198
02:47:28,550 --> 02:47:31,730
I'm literally missing, like, one of her hands.

2199
02:47:31,870 --> 02:47:32,530
Or was her torso?

2200
02:47:35,210 --> 02:47:35,770
Adventureland.

2201
02:47:37,250 --> 02:47:38,470
Why is Daisy...

2202
02:47:38,470 --> 02:47:40,870
Because Daisy's a robot, and they, like, took her apart.

2203
02:47:43,450 --> 02:47:46,430
We should probably board the Jolly Roger, Mickey.

2204
02:47:52,040 --> 02:47:53,840
Looks like Hook's not here.

2205
02:47:56,020 --> 02:47:56,580
Okay.

2206
02:47:56,600 --> 02:47:58,640
I wonder where those stairs lead.

2207
02:47:59,320 --> 02:48:00,100
Maybe it'll help you.

2208
02:48:00,200 --> 02:48:01,100
Oh, there's the sprite.

2209
02:48:01,780 --> 02:48:02,580
There it is.

2210
02:48:03,960 --> 02:48:04,380
Okay.

2211
02:48:05,860 --> 02:48:07,380
You either free the sprite.

2212
02:48:09,240 --> 02:48:11,860
Or find a way to defeat the hook outright.

2213
02:48:13,420 --> 02:48:16,600
Wait, is this the sprite like...

2214
02:48:17,220 --> 02:48:18,860
What the fuck is trying to eat me?

2215
02:48:18,920 --> 02:48:19,980
Oh, is it the crocodile?

2216
02:48:20,460 --> 02:48:21,340
Guys, is the...

2217
02:48:21,340 --> 02:48:21,600
Okay.

2218
02:48:22,800 --> 02:48:25,360
Is freeing the sprite?

2219
02:48:26,500 --> 02:48:26,580
Okay.

2220
02:48:26,600 --> 02:48:27,620
Good?

2221
02:48:30,820 --> 02:48:35,380
Is it a good thing or a bad thing?

2222
02:48:36,020 --> 02:48:39,480
Before I do it, I need to know.

2223
02:48:39,880 --> 02:48:41,680
Is it good or bad?

2224
02:48:45,300 --> 02:48:46,320
Probably depends.

2225
02:48:47,360 --> 02:48:48,340
Is it good?

2226
02:48:48,540 --> 02:48:50,320
Is it a good thing to do?

2227
02:48:51,880 --> 02:48:52,920
Or the spirit.

2228
02:48:53,180 --> 02:48:53,360
Sorry.

2229
02:48:53,960 --> 02:48:55,360
Was it a spider spirit?

2230
02:48:55,480 --> 02:48:56,240
I don't fucking know.

2231
02:48:59,130 --> 02:49:29,650
I need to know the morality and ethics guys listen to your good heart it said there is like another way so I'm like am I doing a good thing or am I doing a bad this is not philosophy class there's only a right and wrong answer we're playing fucking epic Mickey not fucking looking at philosophy right now not this is a game for children where if that there's only a right and a wrong answer.

2232
02:49:38,080 --> 02:49:42,500
Let me evaluate the ethical implication.

2233
02:49:43,320 --> 02:49:46,220
You best not be planning on rescuing the sprite, lad.

2234
02:49:48,560 --> 02:49:50,560
It's morally great.

2235
02:49:51,480 --> 02:49:52,500
But what army matters?

2236
02:49:52,700 --> 02:49:53,540
Welcome aboard.

2237
02:49:54,060 --> 02:49:57,460
Finally a worthy opponent for the great captain hook.

2238
02:49:57,940 --> 02:50:02,500
Now remember, let's keep your arms and legs inside the ship at all costs.

2239
02:50:04,980 --> 02:50:17,480
Oh, he's just there's I hope you're geared up for this Because it's going to be Barrows Barrows Of fun

2240
02:50:20,920 --> 02:50:22,080
Where am I?

2241
02:50:22,360 --> 02:50:22,640
Why am I?

2242
02:50:22,780 --> 02:50:28,040
Oh, I was gonna say Oh, it's like, crap, but don't let the crocodile Near me I mean crocodile

2243
02:50:31,160 --> 02:50:31,960
What's this?

2244
02:50:32,700 --> 02:50:33,820
Wait, what is this?

2245
02:50:33,940 --> 02:50:34,860
Oh my god, give me a sec.

2246
02:50:34,980 --> 02:50:36,620
Let me steal your treasure real quick.

2247
02:50:38,300 --> 02:50:40,720
The mecha, mecha croc.

2248
02:50:41,220 --> 02:50:42,100
The what?

2249
02:50:42,580 --> 02:50:43,080
The crocodile?

2250
02:50:44,800 --> 02:50:47,080
I don't know what you guys thought I said.

2251
02:50:48,080 --> 02:50:49,360
I said the...

2252
02:50:49,960 --> 02:50:52,480
I said the crocodile, guys.

2253
02:50:52,820 --> 02:50:54,060
I don't know what you heard.

2254
02:50:57,500 --> 02:51:02,300
Okay, we'll save the sprite.

2255
02:51:05,560 --> 02:51:08,960
Nexi, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2256
02:51:09,960 --> 02:51:11,000
We'll never go.

2257
02:51:12,060 --> 02:51:14,760
We gotta have a 10 year study on what it does.

2258
02:51:16,360 --> 02:51:18,700
It's down from me at rigging a boy.

2259
02:51:21,980 --> 02:51:25,200
Will anyone, will anyone do the study?

2260
02:51:28,380 --> 02:51:30,260
How do I get up?

2261
02:51:32,700 --> 02:51:33,340
What is he?

2262
02:51:33,500 --> 02:51:34,720
What am I supposed to do?

2263
02:51:35,840 --> 02:51:36,460
Get painted.

2264
02:51:40,620 --> 02:51:42,780
He's like, stop painting me!

2265
02:51:43,800 --> 02:51:44,560
Oh, there it is.

2266
02:51:44,640 --> 02:51:45,380
I didn't see that.

2267
02:51:46,740 --> 02:51:47,560
Oh my god.

2268
02:51:47,880 --> 02:51:49,080
No, no, no, no, no.

2269
02:51:50,820 --> 02:51:51,340
There we go.

2270
02:51:52,220 --> 02:51:54,400
I didn't see that I needed to paint this.

2271
02:51:56,960 --> 02:51:57,360
Okay.

2272
02:52:00,260 --> 02:52:02,000
Oh, that's why I...

2273
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:02,920
Oh, that's...

2274
02:52:02,920 --> 02:52:03,200
Ow.

2275
02:52:04,940 --> 02:52:06,400
Okay, it's just a slow adventure.

2276
02:52:09,080 --> 02:52:09,120
Whoa!

2277
02:52:09,500 --> 02:52:09,940
Stop!

2278
02:52:10,640 --> 02:52:11,240
Stop!

2279
02:52:15,410 --> 02:52:16,410
What's he doing?

2280
02:52:17,390 --> 02:52:18,030
Oh, shit.

2281
02:52:18,250 --> 02:52:19,010
That's fucked up.

2282
02:52:20,610 --> 02:52:22,010
Do I paint the balls?

2283
02:52:23,670 --> 02:52:25,010
Is that what I do?

2284
02:52:25,310 --> 02:52:25,970
Oh, it is.

2285
02:52:29,290 --> 02:52:29,890
Stop!

2286
02:52:30,070 --> 02:52:30,990
Stop!

2287
02:52:31,350 --> 02:52:31,350
Stop!

2288
02:52:31,470 --> 02:52:32,110
It's not cool!

2289
02:52:35,690 --> 02:52:36,270
Okay.

2290
02:52:38,430 --> 02:52:40,530
This is why Shmi left you.

2291
02:52:42,010 --> 02:52:43,390
It's not cool, bro.

2292
02:52:45,530 --> 02:52:47,570
Okay, we gotta do this.

2293
02:52:49,850 --> 02:52:51,630
Okay, how do I...

2294
02:52:52,650 --> 02:52:54,050
I just unpaint that?

2295
02:52:54,150 --> 02:52:54,590
Oh, I do.

2296
02:52:55,570 --> 02:52:56,750
Alright, good ending!

2297
02:52:57,410 --> 02:52:58,990
I rescued this friend!

2298
02:53:02,410 --> 02:53:03,790
I did it!

2299
02:53:04,130 --> 02:53:05,070
Wait, he's just leaving.

2300
02:53:05,230 --> 02:53:06,590
Is he not going to help me?

2301
02:53:07,230 --> 02:53:08,790
She's going to find Pete Pan.

2302
02:53:09,470 --> 02:53:11,370
I knew y'all could save the sprite, Mickey.

2303
02:53:11,890 --> 02:53:15,590
Now return the favor by taking that scoundrel hook off your hands.

2304
02:53:16,230 --> 02:53:16,970
Get to the deck.

2305
02:53:17,390 --> 02:53:20,370
I'm going to need some room to battle this rust bucket.

2306
02:53:22,670 --> 02:53:23,210
It's a hook.

2307
02:53:24,330 --> 02:53:27,230
You want to pick on someone your own size for once?

2308
02:53:30,530 --> 02:53:37,390
what's this my old nemesis i thought i've seen the last of you boy have at you

2310
02:54:01,010 --> 02:54:02,430
This is where all the budget went into.

2311
02:54:02,630 --> 02:54:04,090
This intense anime fight.

2312
02:54:13,750 --> 02:54:15,410
There's the next rocket part in the chest.

2313
02:54:18,570 --> 02:54:20,430
Your paint or thinner capacity can change.

2314
02:54:20,850 --> 02:54:23,230
Can change based on how you deal with important characters.

2315
02:54:23,570 --> 02:54:23,870
And...

2316
02:54:23,870 --> 02:54:24,150
Yay!

2317
02:54:24,570 --> 02:54:26,270
Okay, okay, that's a good upgrade.

2318
02:54:26,710 --> 02:54:27,650
That's a good upgrade.

2319
02:54:27,950 --> 02:54:28,290
That's good.

2320
02:54:28,550 --> 02:54:29,490
That's good, guys.

2321
02:54:29,590 --> 02:54:30,570
We got the good one.

2322
02:54:31,270 --> 02:54:32,430
We got the good upgrade.

2323
02:54:35,050 --> 02:54:43,090

2325
02:55:10,020 --> 02:55:11,580
I was looking at myself.

2326
02:55:13,180 --> 02:55:14,300
Oh, it's right there.

2327
02:55:16,500 --> 02:55:17,100
It's okay.

2328
02:55:17,200 --> 02:55:18,020
He's got this.

2329
02:55:19,140 --> 02:55:20,520
I believe in Pete Patton.

2330
02:55:24,570 --> 02:55:25,410
He doesn't need me.

2331
02:55:25,650 --> 02:55:26,610
He's got this.

2332
02:55:29,110 --> 02:55:31,610
Oh, apparently the last daisy part is here.

2333
02:55:42,370 --> 02:55:43,930
Wait, but I killed his boyfriend.

2334
02:55:44,950 --> 02:55:46,050
He fixed the machine.

2335
02:55:46,690 --> 02:55:47,590
Oh, that means it's safe.

2336
02:55:47,610 --> 02:55:49,890
for us to go home to Skull Island again.

2337
02:55:52,910 --> 02:55:53,770
How delightful.

2338
02:55:54,070 --> 02:55:57,590
With Pan back, the captain will be his jolly old self again.

2339
02:55:57,970 --> 02:56:02,850
And he'll be needing his loyal crew to go after that scurvy knave so we best head out.

2340
02:56:03,590 --> 02:56:08,450
I guess you'll be zipping right back to Mean Street to tell the tale of your Tartuga adventure, won't you?

2341
02:56:09,390 --> 02:56:10,450
Yay, I did it.

2342
02:56:10,510 --> 02:56:11,090
I'm a hero.

2343
02:56:13,030 --> 02:56:15,650
Before we go, I'd like you to have this.

2344
02:56:15,890 --> 02:56:16,890
I think it's... Oh, I did!

2345
02:56:16,970 --> 02:56:18,610
Oh, he had That's fucked.

2346
02:56:18,950 --> 02:56:20,850
Smeet, what were you doing with her torso?

2347
02:56:22,990 --> 02:56:25,310
Goodbye, but wait a minute, Smeet.

2348
02:56:25,870 --> 02:56:29,410
What were you doing with Daisy's torso, Smeet?

2349
02:56:31,090 --> 02:56:31,190
Huh?

2350
02:56:31,630 --> 02:56:33,630
Wait, they gentrified it.

2351
02:56:33,890 --> 02:56:34,710
Where are all the pie?

2352
02:56:38,210 --> 02:56:41,690
They took over the town.

2353
02:56:42,470 --> 02:56:42,510
They took over the town.

2354
02:56:42,510 --> 02:56:42,910
They...

2355
02:56:42,910 --> 02:56:44,050
I...

2356
02:56:44,050 --> 02:56:44,970
I...

2357
02:56:44,970 --> 02:56:45,150
I...

2358
02:56:45,150 --> 02:56:45,170
I...

2359
02:56:46,730 --> 02:56:47,450
I...

2360
02:56:47,610 --> 02:56:49,590
Oh, Mickey, you brought all my parts.

2361
02:56:49,790 --> 02:56:50,450
Thank you.

2362
02:57:00,500 --> 02:57:01,720
We did it.

2363
02:57:02,080 --> 02:57:03,880
She has her body back.

2364
02:57:07,340 --> 02:57:09,220
A lady does like to look her best.

2365
02:57:09,400 --> 02:57:10,120
Thank you, Mickey.

2366
02:57:10,340 --> 02:57:10,700
Oh, my gosh.

2367
02:57:10,780 --> 02:57:12,320
She's so much taller than me.

2368
02:57:12,520 --> 02:57:13,140
Holy shit.

2369
02:57:13,600 --> 02:57:15,420
Wait, it's exposed.

2370
02:57:18,440 --> 02:57:21,160
I like how everything else is like...

2371
02:57:22,160 --> 02:57:23,660
Damn, Oswald's freaky.

2372
02:57:26,360 --> 02:57:27,140
Don't you...

2373
02:57:27,160 --> 02:57:28,560
Where are you looking?

2374
02:57:28,980 --> 02:57:34,000
All I have to say is that Oz was Freaky Moon.

2375
02:57:44,470 --> 02:57:46,290
Any like hidden quest here?

2376
02:57:46,950 --> 02:57:49,150
We haven't painted all the bushes and trees yet.

2377
02:57:49,530 --> 02:57:50,390
What the fuck do you want?

2378
02:57:51,470 --> 02:57:52,590
So demanding.

2379
02:57:54,150 --> 02:57:57,390
He wants me to paint all the trees and bushes?

2380
02:57:59,170 --> 02:57:59,730
Alright.

2381
02:58:00,150 --> 02:58:02,330
I mean, this better get me a goddamn spark.

2382
02:58:03,530 --> 02:58:05,770
Oh, it seems they'll be taking me out to get my legs working again.

2383
02:58:06,210 --> 02:58:08,170
Jibia didn't bring my scrapbook for me.

2384
02:58:08,810 --> 02:58:12,130
I'm pretty sure I left it behind while I was visiting a train station on Mean Street.

2385
02:58:12,550 --> 02:58:14,010
Should I ask Pete where it might be?

2386
02:58:14,170 --> 02:58:17,210
Okay, so I asked Pete about that.

2387
02:58:17,730 --> 02:58:19,650
I mean, more sparks to get.

2388
02:58:20,750 --> 02:58:22,250
But I grab more sparks anyway.

2389
02:58:23,930 --> 02:58:25,490
We get those pies out of our hair.

2390
02:58:25,610 --> 02:58:27,930
Oh my god, excuse me?

2391
02:58:29,750 --> 02:58:30,230
Ricky?

2392
02:58:31,210 --> 02:58:33,950
You're just as brave as I've been hearing.

2393
02:58:34,550 --> 02:58:37,230
Anybody help me, those goddamn pirates.

2394
02:58:40,190 --> 02:58:42,330
Didn't they live here at first?

2395
02:58:42,830 --> 02:58:50,430
Now that he is gone, I'm Mr. Damien, so perhaps he could bring me some ice cream.

2396
02:58:50,890 --> 02:58:54,330
But sweet taste brings me back memories of my Damien.

2397
02:58:54,690 --> 02:58:55,710
Oh, I have an ice cream.

2398
02:58:58,210 --> 02:59:01,110
I can't eat much, but each taste brings back sweet.

2399
02:59:01,210 --> 02:59:27,930
memories okay I got the ice cream pin I can't believe it because the ice cream came from a pirate she didn't want it but because now the ice cream came from me she was like okay yeah how am I worse than these people guys how am I worse than these people here.

2400
02:59:33,120 --> 02:59:34,370
That paint everything?

2401
02:59:35,570 --> 02:59:36,350
Wait, have I not?

2402
02:59:36,490 --> 02:59:36,770
Oh, wait.

2403
02:59:36,970 --> 02:59:38,910
There's one bush right here.

2404
02:59:39,730 --> 02:59:40,270
Wait, what?

2405
02:59:41,410 --> 02:59:43,370
What other bush am I missing?

2406
02:59:47,460 --> 02:59:49,000
Oh, right here.

2407
02:59:50,200 --> 02:59:50,760
Oh, my God.

2408
02:59:50,900 --> 02:59:52,620
Every single bush?

2409
02:59:58,030 --> 02:59:59,570
This guy's crazy.

2410
03:00:01,030 --> 03:00:02,490
Come on, there's one over here.

2411
03:00:03,230 --> 03:00:03,470
Ow.

2412
03:00:07,370 --> 03:00:10,350
How did all of these bushes get unpainted anyway?

2413
03:00:11,910 --> 03:00:13,410
Like, who unpainted all of them?

2414
03:00:16,630 --> 03:00:19,610
Oh my god, there's some behind me.

2415
03:00:19,770 --> 03:00:20,930
And there's no counter.

2416
03:00:21,030 --> 03:00:24,810
I don't even know if I, like, if I'm getting close to finishing it.

2417
03:00:25,290 --> 03:00:27,250
I just have to assume that...

2418
03:00:27,250 --> 03:00:33,510
I just have to assume that, like, I'm missing a lot.

2419
03:00:34,870 --> 03:00:36,410
It doesn't even tell me.

2420
03:00:38,890 --> 03:00:44,210
I better get, I swear to God, if he only gives me a pin, I better get my goddamn spark energy.

2421
03:00:47,170 --> 03:00:49,690
Oh my god, what are the hitboxes for this?

2422
03:00:52,390 --> 03:00:52,870
Yeah.

2423
03:00:54,070 --> 03:00:56,250
I got these guys done.

2424
03:00:59,670 --> 03:01:00,230
Is there any more?

2425
03:01:00,850 --> 03:01:02,090
What's she doing up here?

2426
03:01:04,310 --> 03:01:04,790
Hi!

2427
03:01:05,030 --> 03:01:05,090
Oh!

2428
03:01:05,110 --> 03:01:06,730
for something a little different?

2429
03:01:07,550 --> 03:01:08,590
It's definitely one of my favorites.

2430
03:01:08,810 --> 03:01:09,510
Oh, no.

2431
03:01:10,650 --> 03:01:11,950
No, thank you.

2432
03:01:12,690 --> 03:01:13,710
No racing here.

2433
03:01:14,410 --> 03:01:15,250
I'm retired.

2434
03:01:18,030 --> 03:01:18,910
Is there any more bushes?

2435
03:01:19,350 --> 03:01:20,510
That I haven't cleaned yet?

2436
03:01:20,730 --> 03:01:22,850
Or, like, I haven't, uh, painted?

2437
03:01:27,370 --> 03:01:27,990
Is that it?

2438
03:01:30,070 --> 03:01:31,190
Padding all the plants.

2439
03:01:31,570 --> 03:01:31,890
Lovely work.

2440
03:01:32,070 --> 03:01:35,030

Oh, he's not sucking it up.

2445
03:02:11,630 --> 03:02:12,310
It's not for Pete.

2446
03:02:13,470 --> 03:02:15,350
So I'm not doing a bad thing.

2447
03:02:17,010 --> 03:02:18,810
Bunny, children, and sparks.

2448
03:02:22,210 --> 03:02:23,870
Yeah, okay, it's not bad now.

2449
03:02:24,030 --> 03:02:25,250
Guys, it's not for Pete.

2450
03:02:25,730 --> 03:02:26,710
Now I can...

2451
03:02:26,710 --> 03:02:28,990
Now I can kidnap the kids.

2452
03:02:30,950 --> 03:02:31,550
There we go.

2453
03:02:31,790 --> 03:02:32,170
One.

2454
03:02:33,550 --> 03:02:34,410
But I did it.

2455
03:02:35,670 --> 03:02:37,210
Oh my god, don't get away from me!

2456
03:02:41,790 --> 03:02:43,030

Find those clips for me, huh?

2460
03:03:46,050 --> 03:03:47,030
And hey, small fry.

2461
03:03:47,330 --> 03:03:48,770
We're going to come back through Bog Easy.

2462
03:03:49,170 --> 03:03:51,150
Try not to drop the cartoon in the thinner.

2463
03:03:52,470 --> 03:03:53,730
So you may Pete Tronic.

2464
03:03:53,770 --> 03:03:55,250
I have so many quests from Pete.

2465
03:03:55,770 --> 03:03:57,230
Now two of us, Pete's is smart.

2466
03:03:57,430 --> 03:03:58,330
Things are looking up.

2467
03:03:58,590 --> 03:04:00,770
Of course, having another Pete should be rewarded enough.

2468
03:04:00,870 --> 03:04:02,730
But I suppose you can take a power spark.

2469
03:04:03,210 --> 03:04:04,070
Come see me again.

2470
03:04:04,150 --> 03:04:06,010
I have another thing.

2471
03:04:06,410 --> 03:04:06,810
Okay.

2472
03:04:07,010 --> 03:04:11,010
As long as the children don't get kidnapped by Big Bad Pete, we should be fine.

2473
03:04:11,710 --> 03:04:14,030
I heard, like, doing the Oh my god.

2474
03:04:14,230 --> 03:04:14,590
I swear to God.

2475
03:04:14,670 --> 03:04:15,190
Don't get near me.

2476
03:04:15,270 --> 03:04:16,530
I am this close.

2477
03:04:16,650 --> 03:04:17,990
I'm this close to...

2478
03:04:17,990 --> 03:04:18,190
Oh!

2479
03:04:20,910 --> 03:04:22,390
Don't make me do it!

2480
03:04:22,630 --> 03:04:23,010
Children!

2481
03:04:26,430 --> 03:04:28,070
You know I will.

2482
03:04:29,670 --> 03:04:31,010
I'm this close to me.

2483
03:04:31,890 --> 03:04:33,050
Jailing you.

2484
03:04:37,150 --> 03:04:39,190
Alright, we got another pin.

2485
03:04:40,050 --> 03:04:41,090
There ain't no way.

2486
03:04:41,350 --> 03:04:43,730
I'll turn you over to P. I swear to God.

2487
03:04:46,130 --> 03:04:47,790
It's that easy.

2488
03:04:53,810 --> 03:04:55,590
It's like near it.

2489
03:04:55,810 --> 03:04:57,030
So where the fuck is it?

2490
03:04:58,390 --> 03:05:03,550
It should be like hidden behind the area, I assume.

2491
03:05:06,830 --> 03:05:08,990
What the fuck is her goddamn photo album?

2492
03:05:11,390 --> 03:05:12,470
It's not here.

2493
03:05:14,390 --> 03:05:14,950
Not here.

2494
03:05:17,610 --> 03:05:49,810
here I'll grab this pin yeah got the glove pin okay where did these children come from how did you get here oh my god how did these kids get here get out of here children wait where's the Oh, it's in this gate.

2495
03:05:49,950 --> 03:05:50,130
Okay.

2496
03:05:52,310 --> 03:05:52,830
There it is.

2497
03:05:52,890 --> 03:05:53,810
There's your folder album.

2498
03:05:55,610 --> 03:05:56,450
Oh my god, please.

2499
03:05:57,270 --> 03:05:58,290
Get away from me, kids.

2500
03:05:59,830 --> 03:06:01,950
Me, when I see children.

2501
03:06:04,830 --> 03:06:04,970
Whoops.

2502
03:06:05,190 --> 03:06:05,530
Sorry.

2503
03:06:06,750 --> 03:06:08,550
I wanted to pawn the kids off of him.

2504
03:06:09,830 --> 03:06:11,310
This one is in search through the round.

2505
03:06:11,430 --> 03:06:13,410
A mask has been reported stolen from there.

2506
03:06:13,830 --> 03:06:15,410
Can you go in over there and investigate it?

2507
03:06:15,410 --> 03:06:18,370
I just got my big Achilles yet.

2508
03:06:18,630 --> 03:06:19,990
It's an unsolved mystery.

2509
03:06:20,690 --> 03:06:23,070
Constant Hatchaway was once the lady of Lonesome Matter.

2510
03:06:23,530 --> 03:06:25,150
Several of her husband expires.

2511
03:06:25,390 --> 03:06:26,950
There are suspicions, but no evidence.

2512
03:06:27,450 --> 03:06:29,190
Miss Hatchaway hid a hatch in the house.

2513
03:06:29,350 --> 03:06:30,550
It is evidence I need.

2514
03:06:30,950 --> 03:06:34,590
If you can locate it, the find would be huge for my detective agency.

2515
03:06:35,030 --> 03:06:37,530
You can reach Lonesome Matter by going through Boggyzi.

2516
03:06:37,770 --> 03:06:39,990
There's a projector screen at the end of the street that goes there.

2517
03:06:41,030 --> 03:06:43,070
Oh my god, we're gonna find a murderer?

2518
03:06:45,410 --> 03:06:45,770
weapon.

2519
03:06:47,650 --> 03:06:49,890
I'll let Moody tell Moody as soon as I can.

2520
03:06:50,390 --> 03:06:52,510
Rumors travel fast here, so I'll bet he knows.

2521
03:06:52,890 --> 03:06:56,650
But another solved case, I'm sure married business will roll in.

2522
03:06:56,930 --> 03:06:58,130
I'll add it all to you, Mickey.

2523
03:06:58,530 --> 03:07:00,250
Here's a power spark for the trouble.

2524
03:07:00,650 --> 03:07:03,650
Stop by in a bit, and I'll tell you about another case I'm working on.

2525
03:07:04,310 --> 03:07:05,610
Okay, is that all the cases?

2526
03:07:06,990 --> 03:07:08,390
Okay, the Tiki mask.

2527
03:07:08,510 --> 03:07:11,410
Alright, we'll have to go back anyway, so...

2528
03:07:12,530 --> 03:07:13,750
Alright, let's go back.

2529
03:07:15,730 --> 03:07:17,550
Yeah, that's why his name is Horace.

2530
03:07:18,170 --> 03:07:20,410
Okay, that's the last world I need to unlock.

2531
03:07:23,310 --> 03:07:23,810
But...

2532
03:07:23,810 --> 03:07:25,150
Ten tickets, please.

2533
03:07:30,810 --> 03:07:32,050
What is bad about kids?

2534
03:07:32,410 --> 03:07:36,130
Kids are very cruel, because they haven't developed a morality compass yet.

2535
03:07:37,470 --> 03:07:38,610
Wait, there's footsteps here.

2536
03:07:39,310 --> 03:07:41,130
So they don't know what's right or wrong.

2537
03:07:43,650 --> 03:07:44,650
So they're like...

2538
03:07:45,630 --> 03:07:48,870
So they're, like, particularly more evil than the other age.

2539
03:07:50,410 --> 03:07:52,690
Oh goodness, did you just come from the Tiki hut?

2540
03:07:53,090 --> 03:07:54,530
I was just over the trial and mass.

2541
03:07:54,890 --> 03:07:57,230
But I guess I did give it to Tiki Sam to sell it.

2542
03:07:57,550 --> 03:07:59,090
I have no right to change our agreement.

2543
03:07:59,910 --> 03:08:01,350
Oh, he was the one that stole it.

2544
03:08:04,450 --> 03:08:08,410
They do, yeah, they do things because they think it's fun, and they don't know it's wrong.

2545
03:08:09,710 --> 03:08:12,790
And they're very easily moldable.

2546
03:08:15,170 --> 03:08:16,370
Wait, I gave you the mask.

2547
03:08:16,570 --> 03:08:18,870
This is not your mask.

2548
03:08:18,890 --> 03:08:43,710
what do i give it to horace all right let's give this to daisy real quick yeah they're very like easy to influence i have to treasure this scrapbook there's a special guest sketch i had in here forever and i like you to have it i wanted my power sparks i don't need money in game in game in game

2549
03:08:52,680 --> 03:08:54,100
i think kids

2550
03:08:58,330 --> 03:09:03,830
Kids can say the wildest things in video games.

2551
03:09:07,350 --> 03:09:14,730
Because they have no filter, and they don't know, like, what's right or wrong yet.

2552
03:09:20,570 --> 03:09:21,450
Nice.

2553
03:09:23,350 --> 03:09:24,070
Is that everything?

2554
03:09:24,530 --> 03:09:25,230
All the quests?

2555
03:09:28,190 --> 03:09:28,750
Okay.

2556
03:09:30,930 --> 03:09:34,690
Locate the vintage cartoon and collect film reels for the...

2557
03:09:34,690 --> 03:09:35,350
Oh, wait.

2558
03:09:35,610 --> 03:09:36,650
Did I collect all of it?

2559
03:09:38,250 --> 03:09:39,830
Okay, I gotta go talk to the usher.

2560
03:09:45,960 --> 03:09:46,460
Alright.

2561
03:09:47,880 --> 03:09:48,440
Yay!

2562
03:09:52,640 --> 03:09:54,060
I have a power spark.

2563
03:09:54,280 --> 03:09:54,660
Yay!

2564
03:09:55,460 --> 03:09:57,240
Okay, that should be enough, right?

2565
03:09:58,680 --> 03:10:02,360
I'm gonna need 15 power sparks before I can open the projector screen.

2566
03:10:02,580 --> 03:10:04,640
I found a stash of power sparks while you're away.

2567
03:10:05,080 --> 03:10:06,840
But three children have eaten them.

2568
03:10:07,020 --> 03:10:09,960
You should try to get the power sparks back before from them.

2569
03:10:10,760 --> 03:10:11,240
I did.

2570
03:10:12,560 --> 03:10:14,120
Didn't I literally just do that?

2571
03:10:14,880 --> 03:10:15,860
Oh, there you go.

2572
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:16,640
Now I fixed it.

2573
03:10:25,810 --> 03:10:27,690
Just press this button, pull this lever.

2574
03:10:31,300 --> 03:10:32,980
Projector screen to bog easy.

2575
03:10:33,160 --> 03:10:34,380
Have a safe trip, Mickey.

2576
03:10:34,780 --> 03:10:34,940
Oh.

2577
03:10:35,380 --> 03:10:35,860
Alright.

2578
03:10:37,060 --> 03:10:38,200
I think this...

2579
03:10:38,200 --> 03:10:39,040
Is that the last load?

2580
03:10:39,120 --> 03:10:40,640
That should be the last level, right?

2581
03:10:41,660 --> 03:10:42,660
Are we close?

2582
03:10:43,880 --> 03:10:46,840
Okay, but it took me like three hours to complete the other level.

2583
03:10:47,320 --> 03:10:47,320
Alright.

2584
03:10:47,840 --> 03:10:49,780
Oh, it's the ghost short!

2585
03:10:49,900 --> 03:10:51,160
I love this one!

2586
03:10:51,620 --> 03:10:55,120
It tells about how poor they are, and they have to cut the fucking bean.

2587
03:10:58,660 --> 03:10:59,680
Bean lover!

2588
03:11:01,060 --> 03:11:02,520
Is this the bean lover?

2589
03:11:05,720 --> 03:11:06,840
That one!

2590
03:11:10,080 --> 03:11:11,180
It's too real.

2591
03:11:11,480 --> 03:11:13,220
The air sandwich, yeah!

2592
03:11:15,060 --> 03:11:15,800
Or was it bread?

2593
03:11:15,920 --> 03:11:18,000
Sorry, it was bread or bean.

2594
03:11:18,160 --> 03:11:18,840
I don't remember.

2595
03:11:20,320 --> 03:11:21,400
Is I a bread or bean?

2596
03:11:21,520 --> 03:11:22,240
There's my $20.

2597
03:11:25,100 --> 03:11:26,220
I like that one.

2598
03:11:26,980 --> 03:11:29,440
That one was one of my favorite cartoon shorts.

2599
03:11:31,660 --> 03:11:31,980
Can I jump?

2600
03:11:32,280 --> 03:11:32,800
Yeah, I can.

2601
03:11:33,440 --> 03:11:34,220
Whoa, what is that?

2602
03:11:34,240 --> 03:11:35,420
Was that good good ghost?

2603
03:11:40,470 --> 03:11:42,790
Oh my god, it's a good good ghost!

2604
03:11:46,410 --> 03:11:46,950
Okay.

2605
03:11:49,370 --> 03:11:51,710
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

2606
03:11:51,710 --> 03:11:54,770
Oh, I can't- Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

2607
03:11:56,210 --> 03:11:56,630
Ow.

2608
03:11:57,850 --> 03:11:58,950
That's fucked up.

2609
03:12:00,870 --> 03:12:02,070
Wait, what do I do?

2610
03:12:05,450 --> 03:12:06,490
It's this way.

2611
03:12:08,330 --> 03:12:11,330
Wait, this one is more confusing than the other ones.

2612
03:12:11,530 --> 03:12:12,230
I'm not gonna lie.

2613
03:12:14,970 --> 03:12:17,070
Oh my god, are you serious?

2614
03:12:17,890 --> 03:12:18,110
Okay.

2615
03:12:19,590 --> 03:12:20,650
Go this way.

2616
03:12:21,470 --> 03:12:24,390
I had to look away.

2617
03:12:24,630 --> 03:12:24,990
It was...

2618
03:12:24,990 --> 03:12:27,510
It was so scary.

2619
03:12:28,630 --> 03:12:29,550
Okay, I had to go this way.

2620
03:12:29,750 --> 03:12:30,190
Oh, wait.

2621
03:12:30,810 --> 03:12:31,310
Never mind.

2622
03:12:34,190 --> 03:12:35,390
And then I go up.

2623
03:12:36,450 --> 03:12:38,530
This one's a little more confusing than the others.

2624
03:12:41,770 --> 03:12:43,850
Oh, that has to be the developer's faces.

2625
03:12:50,400 --> 03:12:53,140
Where are the...

2626
03:12:54,540 --> 03:12:56,200
Where are the fucking films?

2627
03:12:58,300 --> 03:12:59,100
This way?

2628
03:13:00,500 --> 03:13:02,340
Did I got hurt by a chair?

2629
03:13:02,920 --> 03:13:04,500
Oh, it's a scary chair.

2630
03:13:04,920 --> 03:13:06,780
Okay, Doki, don't understand.

2631
03:13:07,060 --> 03:13:08,460
That's a spooky chair.

2632
03:13:09,100 --> 03:13:13,540
I was like, what the fuck did a chair hurt me?

2633
03:13:14,040 --> 03:13:15,740
Like, what hurt me there?

2634
03:13:21,500 --> 03:13:46,980
wait where were any of the films i didn't find any films there what the fuck i'm so spooked right now i give up we don't need to find film reels the threat of splinters is no laughing matter serious.

2635
03:13:48,380 --> 03:13:50,380
It's a very uncomfortable chair.

2636
03:13:51,140 --> 03:13:52,800
It was a gamer chair, Doki.

2637
03:13:53,580 --> 03:13:54,200
Oh, hey, Gilbert.

2638
03:13:54,980 --> 03:13:56,280
Looks like we got live one.

2639
03:13:56,420 --> 03:13:57,480
Come on, guys.

2640
03:14:02,290 --> 03:14:02,850
Watch out.

2641
03:14:02,910 --> 03:14:05,010
The ghosts are here, and we're ready to scare.

2642
03:14:05,470 --> 03:14:08,850
Say, Mickey, you look like the kind of guy who likes a good scare.

2643
03:14:09,350 --> 03:14:11,370
I hear that you aim to get to the load in some matter.

2644
03:14:11,870 --> 03:14:13,890
It just so happens that I can open the game.

2645
03:14:14,350 --> 03:14:19,270
If you help me out with some scary and some locals, I'll open that bad thing?

2646
03:14:20,390 --> 03:14:23,610
Guys, is scaring locals a bad or a good thing?

2647
03:14:27,170 --> 03:14:30,610
Wait, that seems like a bad thing to do.

2648
03:14:33,730 --> 03:14:35,750
Did they consent to getting scared?

2649
03:14:36,210 --> 03:14:37,010
Mr. Ghost?

2650
03:14:39,770 --> 03:14:40,670
Oh, hey, there's a bad.

2651
03:14:40,770 --> 03:14:41,730
It's just a purple heart.

2652
03:14:42,610 --> 03:14:43,050
We're lost.

2653
03:14:43,210 --> 03:14:45,070
This is probably very scared with all the ghosts about.

2654
03:14:45,250 --> 03:14:46,950
Perhaps we can locate the owner.

2655
03:14:47,150 --> 03:14:48,130
Yeah, I was like, whoa.

2656
03:14:48,790 --> 03:14:49,710
Guys, look at that.

2657
03:14:49,830 --> 03:14:50,690
I got a purple heart.

2658
03:14:53,530 --> 03:14:54,270
What's that?

2659
03:14:54,610 --> 03:14:57,990
Uh, crime where you impersonate a soldier?

2660
03:15:02,600 --> 03:15:03,340
Is that my butt?

2661
03:15:09,060 --> 03:15:10,020
Stolen valor?

2662
03:15:16,030 --> 03:15:17,550
It's your lucky day, Mickey.

2663
03:15:17,910 --> 03:15:20,330
I have a special offer for you.

2664
03:15:20,890 --> 03:15:23,010
You just pick up that courage medal from the ship, right?

2665
03:15:23,030 --> 03:15:35,490
if lewis gets his hands on it we won't be able to have fun scaring him anymore i can make sure he gets taken somewhere else okay yeah i think that's a it's your loss but don't expect me to do you any favors from now on

2666
03:15:39,030 --> 03:15:42,930
like i'm not supposed to give that to him right

2667
03:15:47,770 --> 03:15:55,630
wait was that good or a oh my god maybe this is philosophy Thank you for your service, Toki.

2668
03:15:56,590 --> 03:15:59,090
Patra has to thank you with a super chat.

2669
03:15:59,430 --> 03:15:59,650
Wait.

2670
03:16:01,150 --> 03:16:02,170
Wait, it was...

2671
03:16:02,170 --> 03:16:04,610
I don't understand.

2672
03:16:05,290 --> 03:16:06,870
Am I scaring bad people?

2673
03:16:07,110 --> 03:16:08,430
Okay, but like...

2674
03:16:08,430 --> 03:16:11,490
Maybe the guy was a really bad person.

2675
03:16:11,730 --> 03:16:12,710
That's why.

2676
03:16:12,850 --> 03:16:16,530
That's why he's getting scared.

2677
03:16:16,630 --> 03:16:18,690
He's getting spooked on right now.

2678
03:16:18,770 --> 03:16:20,190
He could be a really bad person.

2679
03:16:20,270 --> 03:16:21,410
You don't know his history.

2680
03:16:21,810 --> 03:16:23,010

2683
03:16:52,930 --> 03:16:54,070
What a lonely shack.

2684
03:16:54,530 --> 03:16:57,030
We should ask around to find out how the locals know anything.

2685
03:16:57,330 --> 03:16:58,450
Okay, guys, guys.

2686
03:16:59,090 --> 03:17:00,090
Wait, what the fuck?

2687
03:17:01,770 --> 03:17:03,110
I erased her.

2688
03:17:05,070 --> 03:17:06,050
Got your face!

2689
03:17:08,310 --> 03:17:09,390
Okay, guys.

2690
03:17:10,470 --> 03:17:19,230
Was me not giving the ghost the meta a good or bad thing?

2691
03:17:19,610 --> 03:17:21,530
This is not... There's no morality question.

2692
03:17:21,550 --> 03:17:46,870
I need to know I'm questioning my ethics and morality right now Was it a good or bad thing that I I didn't give him the the meta One of books has escaped from Madame Leona's library in those some manner She gets really angry when her collection is disturbed and she's blaming me Can you catch it for me if she doesn't get it back?

2693

I'm in serious trouble

2694
03:17:51,550 --> 03:17:54,490
If it's not recovered, I'll never let live it down.

2695
03:17:55,070 --> 03:17:56,510
Okay, I gotta find the book.

2696
03:17:56,890 --> 03:18:01,130
Remember that guy who directed Epic Mickey also directed Desil X?

2697
03:18:01,330 --> 03:18:02,370
USX Machina?

2698
03:18:02,850 --> 03:18:07,330
Expect some deep philosophical ethical questions.

2699
03:18:09,510 --> 03:18:10,190
Wait, what's over here?

2700
03:18:10,230 --> 03:18:11,290
Oh, it's a power spark.

2701
03:18:12,950 --> 03:18:14,650
That looks like a power spark.

2702
03:18:16,790 --> 03:18:17,990
Oh, hey, there's another lantern.

2703
03:18:18,370 --> 03:18:19,010
Oh, my God.

2704
03:18:19,050 --> 03:18:20,830
It's another goddamn lantern shit.

2705
03:18:23,250 --> 03:18:52,710
life in bog easy has come to halt because of the ghost they move from lonesome matter down here but no one really knows why don't scare me so much but the boys seem paralyzed with fear bertrand is here in the square louis lives in an old shack in the swamp if only there was a way to restore their courage can you help i'll gladly open the gate for you that leads to the mansion yeah i can sense some of the blot in you but i also sense a good heart oh okay okay It was a good thing.

2706
03:18:53,010 --> 03:18:53,430
Okay, okay.

2707
03:18:53,630 --> 03:18:54,330
It's a good thing.

2708
03:18:54,690 --> 03:18:55,410
Oh, there's Donald.

2709
03:19:02,390 --> 03:19:05,230
A mad doctor of Betoworks busted you up.

2710
03:19:05,870 --> 03:19:06,970
Whack, those...

2711
03:19:06,970 --> 03:19:09,010
You want me to find the rest of your parts, right?

2712
03:19:09,170 --> 03:19:10,670
Just tell me where they are.

2713
03:19:11,550 --> 03:19:13,970
Dread it, ghost, haunted, bat rid and tumble down.

2714
03:19:14,990 --> 03:19:15,590
Lonesome matter.

2715
03:19:16,330 --> 03:19:16,710
Got it.

2716
03:19:16,770 --> 03:19:17,690
See you later, Donald.

2717
03:19:18,990 --> 03:19:19,090
Ah!

2718
03:19:25,190 --> 03:19:26,170
Body and abyssus.

2719
03:19:26,510 --> 03:19:30,870
But what's really bad is, those ghosts went and hid them in a lonesome manner.

2720
03:19:31,290 --> 03:19:33,170
No good.

2721
03:19:33,870 --> 03:19:34,490
Crazy ghost.

2722
03:19:35,430 --> 03:19:37,720
Quit showing off with your arms and legs and help me.

2723
03:19:39,590 --> 03:19:39,950
Okay.

2724
03:19:42,870 --> 03:19:45,270
We'll give a lantern here.

2725
03:19:47,410 --> 03:19:48,330
You know what's funny?

2726
03:19:49,290 --> 03:19:52,270
Goofy is the only one out of three that actually has kids.

2727
03:19:52,750 --> 03:19:53,810
Or has a child.

2728
03:19:57,370 --> 03:19:57,990
Um.

2729
03:19:59,050 --> 03:20:00,870
Okay, we gotta give...

2730
03:20:00,870 --> 03:20:01,270
Go to the...

2731
03:20:01,290 --> 03:20:01,590
Louis.

2732
03:20:01,890 --> 03:20:03,790
Okay, let's light this up real fast.

2733
03:20:07,310 --> 03:20:08,110
Goofy fucks.

2734
03:20:08,130 --> 03:20:10,150
Time to finally scare you, so I want to help me out.

2735
03:20:11,410 --> 03:20:13,710
Just put out all the lights, and I'll take care of the rest.

2736
03:20:13,810 --> 03:20:18,890
He's especially easy to scare right now because we took his courage medal, which always made him feel better.

2737
03:20:19,550 --> 03:20:20,810
I bet we could give him a good scare.

2738
03:20:21,030 --> 03:20:22,950
He's thinning out the lamps outside of his cabin.

2739
03:20:23,470 --> 03:20:24,450
This is a perfect chance.

2740
03:20:24,550 --> 03:20:25,570
Let's not waste it.

2741
03:20:25,730 --> 03:20:27,090
Meet me over by the cabin.

2742
03:20:27,390 --> 03:20:28,910
That's not fair!

2743
03:20:29,310 --> 03:20:50,330
The evil quests are so I oh my god If I get to be evil I can scare a better Sorry, I don't think I I'm not gonna I I'm not gonna repeat that I It's not fair.

2744
03:20:50,630 --> 03:20:55,200
I can't give him PTSD Because I have to be good

2745
03:20:59,490 --> 03:21:03,010
It's so you It's so easy.

2746
03:21:04,290 --> 03:21:05,410
Not fair.

2747
03:21:06,010 --> 03:21:06,710
But I know.

2748
03:21:08,910 --> 03:21:12,350
I have his purple heart.

2749
03:21:13,110 --> 03:21:14,530
Don't worry.

2750
03:21:15,630 --> 03:21:15,810
Yeah.

2751
03:21:19,410 --> 03:21:23,130
Good person by the way.

2752
03:21:23,530 --> 03:21:25,290
I'm not doing it.

2753
03:21:25,310 --> 03:21:26,790
I thought about it.

2754
03:21:27,050 --> 03:21:27,550
But look.

2755
03:21:27,670 --> 03:21:28,270
See look.

2756
03:21:28,890 --> 03:21:30,690
You found my badge.

2757
03:21:31,290 --> 03:21:33,930
I always feel more afraid when I carry that around.

2758
03:21:34,570 --> 03:21:35,350
Hey, can I...

2759
03:21:35,350 --> 03:21:35,850
No.

2760
03:21:36,490 --> 03:21:37,950
I have a choice.

2761
03:21:38,070 --> 03:21:39,790
It's like, yes or no.

2762
03:21:41,430 --> 03:21:41,750
All right.

2763
03:21:42,270 --> 03:21:43,310
Here you go.

2764
03:21:43,870 --> 03:21:46,750
If you ever want your health refilled, just come visit my shack.

2765
03:21:47,450 --> 03:21:48,070
No.

2766
03:21:48,510 --> 03:21:51,210
It's such a good person in theory.

2767
03:21:52,010 --> 03:21:55,170
Doing the right thing is so hard.

2768
03:21:58,130 --> 03:21:59,730
What the fuck is that?

2769
03:22:01,290 --> 03:22:04,330
Porch showed an increase in mechanical pirates in Tartuga area.

2770
03:22:06,750 --> 03:22:07,750
Intrusive thoughts.

2771
03:22:11,330 --> 03:22:15,810
Wow, it looks like when I spawn this courage, I won't be able to scare him now.

2772
03:22:18,630 --> 03:22:21,150
It costs nothing to be kind.

2773
03:22:25,470 --> 03:22:30,470
But Toki, you get to have the sense of doing a good thing.

2774
03:22:31,290 --> 03:22:33,130
because you did a good thing.

2775
03:22:33,790 --> 03:22:35,610
It's not funny.

2776
03:22:40,170 --> 03:22:44,670
It costs, yeah, it costs nothing to be evil, too.

2777
03:22:45,930 --> 03:22:46,990
Not fair.

2778
03:22:50,490 --> 03:22:52,010
All right.

2779
03:22:52,890 --> 03:22:55,330
Funny, good, evil.

2780
03:22:56,330 --> 03:22:58,950
All right, I did a good thing.

2781
03:23:01,670 --> 03:23:03,170
Can't judge me no more.

2782
03:23:03,510 --> 03:23:04,970
Because I did a good thing.

2783
03:23:08,170 --> 03:23:11,910
Living so near no lonesome matter can be trying sometimes.

2784
03:23:16,470 --> 03:23:16,890
Oh.

2785
03:23:18,130 --> 03:23:20,850
Materi thinks I'm a scary tack, does she?

2786
03:23:21,650 --> 03:23:24,770
Oh, Troufis, I would feel better if all the lamps around here were lit.

2787
03:23:25,170 --> 03:23:27,950
The ghost put out all the eight light of the lamps I saw.

2788
03:23:28,210 --> 03:23:29,750
Do you think you could relit them for me?

2789
03:23:29,870 --> 03:24:35,210

Wait, what's she doing here?

2792
03:24:38,270 --> 03:24:39,550
You aren't afraid of anything.

2793
03:24:40,430 --> 03:24:41,170
That's right.

2794
03:24:42,790 --> 03:24:43,830
I'm spectacular.

2795
03:24:44,890 --> 03:24:45,930
Wait, how do I get out of here?

2796
03:24:46,050 --> 03:24:47,030
I gotta break this.

2797
03:24:48,030 --> 03:24:48,310
Alright.

2798
03:24:50,470 --> 03:24:51,630
Alright, here you go.

2799
03:24:53,230 --> 03:24:54,130
Oh, I see you're lit them.

2800
03:24:54,230 --> 03:24:55,390
Thank you so much, Mickey.

2801
03:24:55,770 --> 03:24:56,810
You're any panther?

2802
03:24:56,970 --> 03:24:57,710
Come see me.

2803
03:24:58,250 --> 03:24:58,690
Okay.

2804
03:24:59,130 --> 03:24:59,530
Nice.

2805
03:25:01,710 --> 03:25:03,650
You're done right by both Veteran and Lewis.

2806
03:25:03,910 --> 03:25:04,750
You're a hero here.

2807
03:25:05,070 --> 03:25:08,730
I'm sure Materi would open the gate to Lonesome Matter for you now.

2808
03:25:09,710 --> 03:25:10,550
Okay, nice.

2809
03:25:10,690 --> 03:25:11,790
I got my stuff refilled.

2810
03:25:13,790 --> 03:25:16,110
How brave are you to help those poor guys?

2811
03:25:16,930 --> 03:25:19,450
Please accept the gold pin as a token of my appreciation.

2812
03:25:19,950 --> 03:25:21,950
I'll open the gate to Lonesome Matter for you.

2813
03:25:22,190 --> 03:25:24,570
It can help those two guys then get all of us.

2814
03:25:25,950 --> 03:25:27,550
Yay, I did it.

2815
03:25:27,750 --> 03:25:28,430
I'm a hero.

2816
03:25:28,730 --> 03:25:29,890
All right, time to fix Donald.

2817
03:25:31,290 --> 03:26:02,370

2819
03:26:06,870 --> 03:26:07,770
I'm a hero.

2820
03:26:10,930 --> 03:26:12,570
Yes, I do.

2821
03:26:18,790 --> 03:26:20,610
The toughest job out there.

2822
03:26:21,070 --> 03:26:22,370
Turning on the lamp.

2823
03:26:26,930 --> 03:26:28,050
That's right.

2824
03:26:29,250 --> 03:26:31,870
Oh, if you turn on the lamps, they die.

2825
03:26:34,030 --> 03:26:34,430
Cool.

2826
03:26:36,070 --> 03:26:36,630
Whoa!

2827
03:26:38,550 --> 03:26:39,450
Alright, time.

2828
03:26:39,950 --> 03:26:40,590
What does this do?

2829
03:26:41,810 --> 03:26:43,070
Oh nice, there's a film reel.

2830
03:26:43,330 --> 03:26:44,090
I actually need that.

2831
03:26:45,170 --> 03:26:45,450
Alright.

2832
03:26:47,110 --> 03:26:48,750
You don't understand, guys.

2833
03:26:49,530 --> 03:26:51,470
Someone has to turn on that lamp.

2834
03:26:52,370 --> 03:26:55,070
Someone had to do the tough jobs around here.

2835
03:26:58,550 --> 03:26:59,290
Come on.

2836
03:26:59,610 --> 03:27:01,650
This is the slowest spooky pot.

2837
03:27:02,850 --> 03:27:04,210
The slowest of them all.

2838
03:27:04,610 --> 03:27:05,510
Get me out of here.

2839
03:27:06,710 --> 03:27:07,050
Alright.

2840
03:27:08,730 --> 03:27:10,110
Make that book fly!

2841
03:27:12,090 --> 03:27:13,090
Okay, but wait for me.

2842
03:27:13,250 --> 03:27:13,810
Okay, book.

2843
03:27:15,530 --> 03:27:16,690
Hello, Mr. Book?

2844
03:27:18,190 --> 03:27:19,050
Mr. Book!

2845
03:27:19,910 --> 03:27:21,790
You're right, the light hurts the gamers.

2846
03:27:25,530 --> 03:27:26,110
Nice.

2847
03:27:27,970 --> 03:27:29,610
Okay, goodbye, ghost.

2848
03:27:32,010 --> 03:27:33,330
Alright, goodbye, girl.

2849
03:27:34,690 --> 03:27:35,090
Yay!

2850
03:27:38,430 --> 03:27:39,050
Okay.

2851
03:27:40,590 --> 03:27:41,710
Turn off this light.

2852
03:27:42,650 --> 03:27:43,150
Bye.

2853
03:27:44,570 --> 03:27:47,190
Okay, I knew there was a film reel back there.

2854
03:27:47,850 --> 03:27:50,670
From, like, zero film reels to, like, two.

2855
03:27:54,470 --> 03:27:56,230
Lonesome Manor Time!

2856
03:27:58,830 --> 03:28:01,150
Of course, light mode gets rid of the gamers.

2857
03:28:01,950 --> 03:28:03,050
I think we go outside?

2858
03:28:04,090 --> 03:28:06,170
Look what happened to me when I went outside.

2859
03:28:06,830 --> 03:28:07,450
Almost...

2860
03:28:09,930 --> 03:28:37,570
I almost actually went through two two events that I know that some people don't even experience once a lot happened I went through a volcanic eruption and the was it the most rain ever recorded in Hong Kong two very funny if I don't definitely not as funny when you when you're there

2861
03:28:42,310 --> 03:28:42,970
Spooky!

2862
03:28:44,070 --> 03:28:46,810
Spooky, scary skeletons.

2863
03:28:47,130 --> 03:28:54,870
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

2864
03:28:55,750 --> 03:28:56,290
Spooky.

2865
03:28:56,370 --> 03:28:57,010
You know what I mean?

2866
03:28:57,010 --> 03:28:57,770
I want to change clothes.

2867
03:28:59,690 --> 03:29:00,690
Wait, no.

2868
03:29:02,410 --> 03:29:03,930
What was that?

2869
03:29:04,170 --> 03:29:05,850
I don't like the football one.

2870
03:29:06,550 --> 03:29:07,750
I have to find these.

2871
03:29:07,830 --> 03:29:09,630
Alright, let's be regular Mickey now.

2872
03:29:10,510 --> 03:29:13,030
I'm done being a steam...

2873
03:29:13,030 --> 03:29:15,590
I'm done being in public domain, Mickey.

2874
03:29:19,230 --> 03:29:21,650
The symbol again just scrolls through the graveyard.

2875
03:29:21,930 --> 03:29:22,450
So simple!

2876
03:29:24,430 --> 03:29:25,590
Now it's in here.

2877
03:29:26,470 --> 03:29:29,210
When Mr. Jerome left to the USA...

2878
03:29:29,210 --> 03:29:30,650
Wait, he left...

2879
03:29:30,650 --> 03:29:34,450
He, like, went to America and then they gave him a grave?

2880
03:29:36,650 --> 03:29:39,910
The master jokes even up there, she's still roasting folks.

2881
03:29:43,210 --> 03:29:44,390
That's fucked up.

2882
03:29:45,790 --> 03:29:48,650
He traveled to the States and they just enacted a grave for him.

2883
03:29:51,270 --> 03:29:54,190
Old Uncle Hoffman built his own coffin in which he could lay.

2884
03:29:54,730 --> 03:29:56,870
Couldn't afford a wood, so he made it out of clay.

2885
03:29:59,130 --> 03:30:00,570
That's not so bad.

2886
03:30:03,770 --> 03:30:04,550
Rest in peace, Charles.

2887
03:30:04,730 --> 03:30:06,530
She fell from Kilimanjaro.

2888
03:30:09,930 --> 03:30:12,750
was changing in light when he had a shocking idea.

2889
03:30:13,530 --> 03:30:17,430
Rest in peace, dear Uncle Nate, who would have foreseen your twisted fate?

2890
03:30:19,450 --> 03:30:19,850
Oh wait.

2891
03:30:20,250 --> 03:30:24,630
Rolf was once here, but is no more the long arm of the law, even the score.

2892
03:30:24,890 --> 03:30:26,690
Oh, he's a criminal.

2893
03:30:28,270 --> 03:30:29,230
That is so bad.

2894
03:30:31,850 --> 03:30:35,350
Hey, what's the point of restoring their graves?

2895
03:30:37,190 --> 03:30:37,670
Anyway.

2896
03:30:38,470 --> 03:30:39,690
There's no point in doing that.

2897
03:30:39,930 --> 03:30:41,590
Just give me little funny stories.

2898
03:30:44,950 --> 03:30:46,170
Yeah, what the fuck was the point?

2899
03:30:46,850 --> 03:30:49,050
To honor the dead, Doki.

2900
03:30:50,450 --> 03:30:53,210
What's the point if I can't get anything out of it?

2901
03:30:54,190 --> 03:30:55,190
Here is Timo.

2902
03:30:55,550 --> 03:30:56,170
Work to the core.

2903
03:30:56,350 --> 03:30:57,030
Now he's using.

2904
03:30:57,210 --> 03:30:58,290
Can't take no more.

2905
03:31:03,250 --> 03:31:05,550
Those islands rise up from...

2906
03:31:05,550 --> 03:31:06,310
Must be part of...

2907
03:31:06,310 --> 03:31:07,710
At least it'll help you get across.

2908
03:31:07,850 --> 03:31:08,330
Oh, okay.

2909
03:31:10,570 --> 03:31:11,370
Oh, okay.

2910
03:31:11,410 --> 03:31:12,050
I just put a T.

2911
03:31:12,070 --> 03:31:12,950
on here.

2912
03:31:13,990 --> 03:31:14,630
TV tab.

2913
03:31:17,790 --> 03:31:18,690
Yes, with the TV.

2914
03:31:20,730 --> 03:31:21,330
There we go.

2915
03:31:22,470 --> 03:31:24,550
I got the TV up.

2916
03:31:29,990 --> 03:31:31,590
Okay, now they're my friends.

2917
03:31:33,350 --> 03:31:33,990
What's over here?

2918
03:31:35,670 --> 03:31:37,150
Oh, there's more graves.

2919
03:31:39,330 --> 03:31:40,330
The tombstones were sell.

2920
03:31:40,450 --> 03:31:43,590
Please contact Gremlin Maxim if interested.

2921
03:31:46,730 --> 03:31:49,110
How can we link this to Kingdom Hearts?

2922
03:31:54,670 --> 03:31:56,550
Hey, they didn't announce Silk Song yet.

2923
03:31:57,250 --> 03:31:58,210
At Gamescom?

2924
03:31:58,570 --> 03:31:59,170
No, right?

2925
03:32:03,430 --> 03:32:05,270
It still doesn't exist, right?

2926
03:32:05,550 --> 03:32:07,270
Cousin Ethan enjoys his papers.

2927
03:32:07,450 --> 03:32:09,670
Pulled one too many and made the papers.

2928
03:32:10,070 --> 03:32:12,410
Wait, they actually announced Silk Song?

2929
03:32:12,630 --> 03:32:13,450
Wait, okay, kind of?

2930
03:32:13,470 --> 03:32:14,270
Okay, was it what?

2931
03:32:14,410 --> 03:32:15,130
Three seconds?

2932
03:32:16,430 --> 03:32:18,810
They announced an announcement for...

2933
03:32:18,830 --> 03:32:19,650
Thursday.

2934
03:32:20,330 --> 03:32:22,550
It was the first thing they showed.

2935
03:32:23,790 --> 03:32:26,310
There's an announcement in 24 hours.

2936
03:32:26,470 --> 03:32:28,250
Oh, so it was 3 seconds.

2937
03:32:28,990 --> 03:32:32,690
Cousin Alex lies beneath a 15 seconds, actually.

2938
03:32:33,190 --> 03:32:35,430
The spectra behind him made no sound.

2939
03:32:35,950 --> 03:32:39,690
Mr. Jones, master of the chase, collecting the reaper, but lost the race.

2940
03:32:43,180 --> 03:32:44,220
I can't believe it.

2941
03:32:44,520 --> 03:32:45,740
They've done it.

2942
03:32:45,900 --> 03:32:47,360
They finally did it.

2943
03:32:47,480 --> 03:32:49,400
They've announced 6 Silk Song.

2944
03:32:49,820 --> 03:33:22,110
They even announce it and oh I'm stuck hello oh my god okay I'm back they've actually I can't believe it they finally did it they've announced an announcement the brother j builders renowned built the graveyard where they lay in the ground I wish they like never announced it

2945
03:33:26,690 --> 03:33:44,610

2946
03:33:47,970 --> 03:33:56,210
it's like schrodinger's cat and then instead of cat is silk saw

2947
03:34:03,600 --> 03:34:04,060
Whoa!

2948
03:34:06,080 --> 03:34:08,580
Why the fuck did that rock got blasted out?

2949
03:34:11,280 --> 03:34:12,940
Oh, it's the mad doctor.

2950
03:34:13,520 --> 03:34:15,600
I've heard about you stumbling about in wasteland.

2951
03:34:15,960 --> 03:34:18,320
You're wrecked the day you found me, Mickey Mouse.

2952
03:34:18,980 --> 03:34:22,200
Because as far as you'll get, my defense will keep you out.

2953
03:34:24,780 --> 03:34:27,420
It's both in a released and unreleased state.

2954
03:34:30,970 --> 03:34:32,990
It looks like he left something behind.

2955
03:34:33,210 --> 03:34:34,230
What do you think it is?

2956
03:34:36,210 --> 03:34:41,310
Okay, if they announce Silk Song tomorrow or release date, I'll play Hollow Knight.

2957
03:34:42,730 --> 03:34:44,450
We'll just lay the rest here, Armin.

2958
03:34:44,630 --> 03:34:46,490
Who picked a fight with too many bars?

2959
03:34:52,840 --> 03:34:55,060
A brush in hand rests Aunt Jenny.

2960
03:34:55,380 --> 03:34:57,500
Finally, her art worth more than a penny.

2961
03:34:58,800 --> 03:34:59,260
Oh, okay.

2962
03:34:59,380 --> 03:35:00,960
Where's the lookout?

2963
03:35:01,600 --> 03:35:02,220
Oh, shit.

2964
03:35:03,140 --> 03:35:03,940
It's a little too late.

2965
03:35:03,960 --> 03:35:04,180
Wait.

2966
03:35:05,180 --> 03:35:08,460
For Nick, the brick fell too quick.

2967
03:35:10,380 --> 03:35:12,380
What will make this?

2968
03:35:17,030 --> 03:35:19,710
Wait, but where is...

2969
03:35:22,510 --> 03:35:23,870
Where the fuck is the thing?

2970
03:35:25,570 --> 03:35:27,170
Where the fuck is my anvil?

2971
03:35:27,470 --> 03:35:29,430
How am I supposed to...

2972
03:35:29,430 --> 03:35:30,250
Ah, fuck this.

2973
03:35:31,450 --> 03:35:32,550
An anvil maybe?

2974
03:35:32,830 --> 03:35:34,210
I don't need an anvil for this.

2975
03:35:34,270 --> 03:35:35,670
I can just put a TV.

2976
03:35:38,130 --> 03:35:39,430
Okay, apparently not.

2977
03:35:39,530 --> 03:35:40,630
It's not strong enough.

2978
03:35:44,350 --> 03:35:46,530
At least I can go up the stairs.

2979
03:35:49,290 --> 03:35:51,570
Okay, the anvil has to be up here somewhere.

2980
03:35:54,490 --> 03:35:55,050
Spooky.

2981
03:35:58,890 --> 03:36:00,730
Where the fuck is the anvil?

2982
03:36:02,710 --> 03:36:03,870
Oh shit, hello.

2983
03:36:05,150 --> 03:36:05,610
Hello.

2984
03:36:07,350 --> 03:36:08,830
There we go.

2985
03:36:09,810 --> 03:36:10,490
Get out of here.

2986
03:36:11,350 --> 03:36:13,050
That's Badouche had me trapped in here.

2987
03:36:13,170 --> 03:36:14,290
I was sure I was a goner.

2988
03:36:14,590 --> 03:36:15,830
Here, take this Anvil sketch.

2989
03:36:15,950 --> 03:36:18,310
Oh, I can just summon an Anvil now.

2990
03:36:21,070 --> 03:36:22,990
Well, this is a weight off my mind.

2991
03:36:23,190 --> 03:36:24,690
You found an Anvil sketch.

2992
03:36:25,830 --> 03:36:27,690
How many times I said that to yourself?

2993
03:36:27,990 --> 03:36:30,810
What I could do right now with even one Anvil.

2994
03:36:31,770 --> 03:36:32,650
Remove opponents.

2995
03:36:33,030 --> 03:36:34,250
Trigger pressure plates.

2996
03:36:34,550 --> 03:36:34,990
Climb.

2997
03:36:37,130 --> 03:36:38,810
Oh my god, I can use this as a platform.

2998
03:36:38,970 --> 03:36:39,590
Wait, that's nice.

2999
03:36:39,630 --> 03:36:40,490
My own platform.

3000
03:36:42,410 --> 03:36:44,390
Okay, and then press LB.

3001
03:36:44,770 --> 03:36:45,090
All right.

3002
03:36:46,190 --> 03:36:48,370
The sketches at least don't weigh anything.

3003
03:36:48,750 --> 03:36:49,850
The anvil's.

3004
03:36:49,850 --> 03:36:50,110
Oh!

3005
03:36:51,930 --> 03:36:52,410
Yay!

3006
03:36:53,310 --> 03:36:53,770
Okay.

3007
03:36:54,470 --> 03:36:55,690
Oh, and I locked it, too.

3008
03:36:58,230 --> 03:36:58,790
All right.

3009
03:36:58,930 --> 03:36:59,310
Nice.

3010
03:37:00,430 --> 03:37:03,130
I have the anvil and...

3011
03:37:03,670 --> 03:37:07,170
I bet he was taking that chest with him when we hadn't scared him off.

3012
03:37:07,330 --> 03:37:08,110
Scared who off?

3013
03:37:08,590 --> 03:37:10,150
Who the fuck did I scare?

3014
03:37:12,730 --> 03:37:25,470
I didn't there was nobody here oh no my little guy my little gremlin is a little schizo I was like there's no one here who do I scare who am I scaring up

3017
03:38:17,250 --> 03:38:24,630
it's like the unnamed soldier guys it's a we'll never know he was he wasn't he was just buried Randomly, guys.

3018
03:38:24,890 --> 03:38:26,310
The unnamed soldier, everyone.

3019
03:38:26,750 --> 03:38:27,410
The unnamed...

3020
03:38:29,850 --> 03:38:33,530
I can't believe they didn't give him a tombstone, guys.

3021
03:38:33,650 --> 03:38:35,130
That's so fucked up.

3022
03:38:35,370 --> 03:38:37,850
That they forgot in the history.

3023
03:38:38,530 --> 03:38:39,810
Oh, man, guys.

3024
03:38:39,870 --> 03:38:42,690
That's so messed up, guys.

3025
03:38:42,970 --> 03:38:47,070
I can't believe they didn't give him a gravestone.

3026
03:38:51,010 --> 03:38:53,670
I can't believe they did.

3027
03:38:53,810 --> 03:39:06,690
that guy that's so messed up it was like this when i got here guys what was the point of painting all these tombstones earlier

3028
03:39:12,050 --> 03:39:13,590

03:39:16,650 --> 03:39:25,850

3030
03:39:30,010 --> 03:39:30,310
Oh, wait.

3031
03:39:30,530 --> 03:39:31,750
Why was there a pirate here?

3032
03:39:32,010 --> 03:39:33,410
Can I...

3033
03:39:36,890 --> 03:39:37,330
Ow!

3034
03:39:42,920 --> 03:39:44,180
Tarni and ghosts aren't really ghosts.

3035
03:39:44,280 --> 03:39:45,640
They were never alive, so to speak.

3036
03:39:45,860 --> 03:39:46,420
What the fuck?

3037
03:39:48,100 --> 03:39:51,380
Madam Leona is feared by many, but she kind to those who help her.

3038
03:39:51,900 --> 03:39:53,280
Am I supposed to kill them?

3039
03:39:53,380 --> 03:39:55,080
Or, like, let them chill?

3040
03:39:55,620 --> 03:39:56,760
I just locked them up.

3041
03:39:57,880 --> 03:39:58,660
There you go.

3042
03:40:04,240 --> 03:40:06,080
There we go.

3043
03:40:06,180 --> 03:40:09,460
I'll just get back into your prison, I guess.

3044
03:40:11,810 --> 03:40:14,460
Are you ready to enter the Lonesome Manor?

3045
03:40:14,700 --> 03:40:14,940
Yeah.

3046
03:40:15,600 --> 03:40:16,780
Sealed the way.

3047
03:40:21,810 --> 03:40:23,710
Out of sight, out of mind, exactly.

3048
03:40:24,050 --> 03:40:25,670
It's like he was never there.

3049
03:40:28,810 --> 03:40:30,150
It's a time thing.

3050
03:40:32,510 --> 03:40:34,270
There's something's over here, though.

3051
03:40:37,920 --> 03:40:38,660
Oh, is it filmed?

3052
03:40:39,580 --> 03:40:40,460
Oh, I knew it.

3053
03:40:40,560 --> 03:40:41,860
I knew there was a film reel.

3054
03:40:42,460 --> 03:40:43,000
Never mind.

3055
03:40:43,120 --> 03:40:44,340
It was just more money.

3056
03:40:44,860 --> 03:40:45,580
It was just $5.

3057
03:40:49,400 --> 03:40:50,000
That's it.

3058
03:40:50,100 --> 03:40:51,180
Seals you in the wall.

3059
03:40:56,040 --> 03:40:57,680
Don't make me angry.

3060
03:41:01,160 --> 03:41:02,500
Okay, oh, there's the film reel.

3061
03:41:03,220 --> 03:41:03,920
What the fuck?

3062
03:41:04,300 --> 03:41:05,220
Wait, why didn't that...

3063
03:41:07,120 --> 03:41:08,160
Oh, that was weird.

3064
03:41:11,120 --> 03:41:12,220
Alright, nice.

3065
03:41:12,740 --> 03:41:13,540
Got the film real.

3066
03:41:14,320 --> 03:41:16,340
Oh, this is a mad doctor cartoon.

3067
03:41:20,790 --> 03:41:23,190
We're actually in the mad doctors there.

3068
03:41:25,770 --> 03:41:26,730
Wait, what's over here?

3069
03:41:29,430 --> 03:41:32,290
I mean, I don't need $20 right now.

3070
03:41:37,050 --> 03:41:38,430
Okay, there's ice there.

3071
03:41:38,530 --> 03:41:40,150
There must be a film up top.

3072
03:41:45,610 --> 03:41:46,650
Ooh, spooky spider.

3073
03:41:48,030 --> 03:41:49,230
And then there's a...

3074
03:41:49,230 --> 03:41:49,910
What is this open?

3075
03:41:50,090 --> 03:41:51,070
I knew it.

3076
03:41:51,750 --> 03:41:52,210
Yay!

3077
03:41:53,750 --> 03:41:54,730
Yeah, I'm sure.

3078
03:41:55,570 --> 03:41:56,550
I'm ready to enter.

3079
03:41:56,690 --> 03:41:57,490
Don'ts a matter.

3080
03:42:01,470 --> 03:42:02,250
There's a scooter.

3081
03:42:09,540 --> 03:42:12,100
Looks like a lot of poltergeists are loose in here.

3082
03:42:14,600 --> 03:42:15,100
Oh.

3083
03:42:17,260 --> 03:42:48,220

3084
03:42:50,500 --> 03:42:51,780
Make them all good people.

3085
03:42:53,080 --> 03:42:54,420
It's not brainwashing.

3086
03:42:56,680 --> 03:42:58,260
Guys, it's not brainwashing.

3087
03:42:58,420 --> 03:43:00,140
They all wanted to be good anyway.

3088
03:43:00,940 --> 03:43:02,600
What's the point of being here?

3089
03:43:04,920 --> 03:43:05,780
Wait, what?

3090
03:43:07,180 --> 03:43:08,900
What was the point of being here?

3091
03:43:10,220 --> 03:43:13,420
Oh, I can use them as platforms.

3092
03:43:13,880 --> 03:43:14,260
Oh!

3093
03:43:16,400 --> 03:43:17,300
What the fuck?

3094
03:43:17,680 --> 03:43:17,680
Wait.

3095
03:43:21,560 --> 03:43:22,820
Wait, what is the point of...

3096
03:43:22,820 --> 03:43:23,060
Oh!

3097
03:43:23,580 --> 03:43:24,600
Oh, there was...

3098
03:43:24,600 --> 03:43:25,920
There was stuff here.

3099
03:43:26,660 --> 03:43:26,880
Okay.

3100
03:43:29,360 --> 03:43:29,840
Like...

3101
03:43:29,840 --> 03:43:31,560
Okay, I can't do anything here.

3102
03:43:36,330 --> 03:43:37,050
Is there anything in here?

3103
03:43:38,610 --> 03:43:39,330
Film reel.

3104
03:43:40,050 --> 03:43:41,590
Oh, it's Colonel Pete's film reel!

3105
03:43:41,710 --> 03:43:42,550
We needed that.

3106
03:43:45,110 --> 03:43:45,590
Okay.

3107
03:43:47,650 --> 03:43:48,130
But...

3108
03:43:49,210 --> 03:43:49,690
Good.

3109
03:43:51,050 --> 03:43:52,530
The power of good.

3110
03:43:52,890 --> 03:43:54,230
Okay, and then we gotta get rid of him.

3111
03:43:55,750 --> 03:43:56,350
There we go.

3112
03:43:57,990 --> 03:43:58,990
Okay, what does this do?

3113
03:44:01,490 --> 03:44:03,970
Okay, we gotta grab some money real quick too.

3114
03:44:04,990 --> 03:44:08,070
We gotta rob these guys a little, but it's okay, they're good now.

3115
03:44:08,150 --> 03:44:09,290
They let me rob them.

3116
03:44:09,910 --> 03:44:10,910
They consented.

3117
03:44:12,790 --> 03:44:15,470
And we'll paint this so I can use it as a platform.

3118
03:44:20,390 --> 03:44:40,750
the power good nice keep painting yes oh my god what the fuck okay okay that spooked me a little bit I was like what was he doing uh I have to unpaint that

03:44:56,360 --> 03:44:57,480
The power good!

3121
03:44:58,140 --> 03:44:59,420
How compelled you!

3122
03:45:01,120 --> 03:45:02,280
Anything back here?

3123
03:45:03,500 --> 03:45:03,980
No.

3124
03:45:05,620 --> 03:45:06,720
Had to go this way.

3125
03:45:08,000 --> 03:45:09,520
How do I get...

3126
03:45:09,520 --> 03:45:11,560
How do I get that platform with me?

3127
03:45:11,760 --> 03:45:13,500
Power Pink compels you!

3128
03:45:18,540 --> 03:45:21,640
I gotta make sure, like, he doesn't go crazy on me.

3129
03:45:22,480 --> 03:45:23,420
How do I get up that?

3130
03:45:24,440 --> 03:45:25,660
Get up from there.

3131
03:45:25,820 --> 03:45:26,380
Oh, he's over there.

3132
03:45:26,400 --> 03:45:27,680
They're locked up.

3133
03:45:30,640 --> 03:45:31,600
Oh, okay, there you go.

3134
03:45:32,680 --> 03:45:34,200
I thought it doesn't go to me.

3135
03:45:35,400 --> 03:45:36,020
I reached this.

3136
03:45:36,100 --> 03:45:36,840
I'm going to snipe him.

3137
03:45:37,760 --> 03:45:38,260
There you go.

3138
03:45:40,320 --> 03:45:40,620
Yay!

3139
03:45:42,040 --> 03:45:43,280
Don't worry, I'm here!

3140
03:45:44,580 --> 03:45:45,180
Thank you, sir.

3141
03:45:45,320 --> 03:45:47,820
I assume you're here full of the plans of the mad doctor.

3142
03:45:48,360 --> 03:45:48,960
I shall help.

3143
03:45:49,280 --> 03:45:50,960
I'll open the way for a brief moment.

3144
03:45:51,100 --> 03:45:52,740
A moment is all I can do.

3145
03:45:54,200 --> 03:45:54,640
Wait.

3146
03:45:54,960 --> 03:45:56,320
How fast is the moment?

3147
03:45:56,400 --> 03:45:56,660
though.

3148
03:45:59,200 --> 03:46:00,380
Oh, it's timed.

3149
03:46:00,820 --> 03:46:01,800
Okay, it's timed.

3150
03:46:03,020 --> 03:46:06,400
Okay, okay, before I go there, though, I need to go this way.

3151
03:46:09,400 --> 03:46:11,420
I'm gonna steal some money real quick.

3152
03:46:12,760 --> 03:46:15,100
Where the fuck is Donald Duck's parts, though?

3153
03:46:16,120 --> 03:46:17,120
Is it back here?

3154
03:46:23,780 --> 03:46:24,840
Okay, oh, okay.

3155
03:46:24,980 --> 03:46:26,540
We're gonna have to put the anvil in.

3156
03:46:27,680 --> 03:46:28,560
Get out of here.

3157
03:46:29,720 --> 03:46:30,160
Alright.

3158
03:46:35,600 --> 03:46:36,640
Get out of here.

3159
03:46:39,580 --> 03:46:40,120
Get out of here.

3160
03:46:40,260 --> 03:46:41,180
I need to put my anvil.

3161
03:46:44,360 --> 03:46:44,980
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

3162
03:46:45,620 --> 03:46:46,380
Oh, my God.

3163
03:46:46,540 --> 03:46:47,680
I can't multitask.

3164
03:46:48,840 --> 03:46:49,180
All right.

3165
03:46:50,560 --> 03:46:51,280
Oh, is anyone there?

3166
03:46:51,500 --> 03:46:52,920
I can't stay outside this bottle.

3167
03:46:53,160 --> 03:46:53,920
Is that Gilbert?

3168
03:46:54,500 --> 03:46:57,760
The mad doctor heard two of his servants flank the door to open the cell.

3169
03:46:58,140 --> 03:47:01,440
That opened it, and then he stuck me in this bottle to put it in here.

3170
03:47:01,740 --> 03:47:01,980
Oh.

3171
03:47:02,540 --> 03:47:03,420
Did I not do it?

3172
03:47:04,320 --> 03:47:05,400
My anvil?

3173
03:47:07,000 --> 03:47:08,020
How the fuck?

3174
03:47:09,300 --> 03:47:10,860
Oh, I can unpaint it.

3175
03:47:11,160 --> 03:47:12,020
Okay, okay, okay.

3176
03:47:13,040 --> 03:47:14,040
That's messed up.

3177
03:47:14,840 --> 03:47:15,920
They broke my anvil.

3178
03:47:16,780 --> 03:47:18,300
How are they that strong?

3179
03:47:21,990 --> 03:47:24,290
Holy shit, they're tanky as fuck.

3180
03:47:28,840 --> 03:47:29,140
Okay.

3181
03:47:30,740 --> 03:47:31,700
Wait, what?

3182
03:47:33,100 --> 03:47:35,860
Oh, it's only one at a time.

3183
03:47:36,020 --> 03:47:37,180
I'm a little stupid.

3184
03:47:40,580 --> 03:48:37,320

Okay.

3186
03:48:44,060 --> 03:48:45,660
I hope...

3187
03:48:45,660 --> 03:48:46,740

It's...

03:48:48,200 --> 03:48:49,500
It's good, right?

3191
03:48:52,700 --> 03:48:53,500
Like...

3192
03:48:53,500 --> 03:48:55,800
Would they be a good ghost?

3193
03:49:03,190 --> 03:49:04,630
That's one skull.

3194
03:49:04,850 --> 03:49:06,050
The spirits are free.

3195
03:49:06,830 --> 03:49:08,310
Let's find the other skull.

3196
03:49:09,130 --> 03:49:09,490
Okay.

3197
03:49:12,350 --> 03:49:41,790

3198
03:49:44,150 --> 03:49:45,970
Does he have a Donald part?

3199
03:49:46,850 --> 03:49:47,610
Good show.

3200
03:49:49,110 --> 03:49:49,830
Thanks for all the help.

3201
03:49:50,190 --> 03:49:51,210
Here's the way out.

3202
03:49:52,170 --> 03:49:54,130
Gotta take out, but here have my treasure.

3203
03:49:54,310 --> 03:49:55,550
You've earned it.

3204
03:49:56,230 --> 03:49:56,710
Yay.

3205
03:49:58,410 --> 03:49:59,850
What's in it?

3206
03:50:02,170 --> 03:50:03,370
Oh, it's a pen.

3207
03:50:05,070 --> 03:50:05,450
Yay.

3208
03:50:09,350 --> 03:50:10,750
Wait, what the fuck?

3209
03:50:11,950 --> 03:50:13,610
Oh, wait, that's where he was in.

3210
03:50:15,010 --> 03:50:15,370
Okay.

3211
03:50:18,350 --> 03:50:20,170
Oh, they made him good.

3212
03:50:20,450 --> 03:50:21,130
Okay, that's good.

3213
03:50:24,670 --> 03:50:25,150
Alright.

3214
03:50:26,170 --> 03:50:28,130
I just want to make sure that...

3215
03:50:28,130 --> 03:50:30,210
Wait, did I go up there yet, guys?

3216
03:50:31,670 --> 03:50:32,350
I did.

3217
03:50:32,430 --> 03:50:33,670
That's when I saved the man.

3218
03:50:34,030 --> 03:50:34,450
The gremlin.

3219
03:50:35,510 --> 03:50:36,250
The man.

3220
03:50:38,150 --> 03:50:39,330
I guess there's no dog.

3221
03:50:39,350 --> 03:50:41,450
no part here, I assume.

3222
03:50:43,090 --> 03:50:45,410
Yeah, I'm ready to go to the stretching room.

3223
03:50:49,330 --> 03:50:51,610
Alright, let's go to the stretching room.

3224
03:50:55,380 --> 03:50:56,540
There's nothing here.

3225
03:50:56,720 --> 03:50:56,960
Wait.

3226
03:50:58,220 --> 03:50:59,360
I knew it.

3227
03:51:00,520 --> 03:51:02,300
I knew this was a platform.

3228
03:51:06,260 --> 03:51:07,400
Alright, I could tell.

3229
03:51:07,640 --> 03:51:08,860
The what room?

3230
03:51:09,580 --> 03:51:10,780
What is the stretching room?

3231
03:51:14,770 --> 03:51:17,250
All right, off we go.

3232
03:51:18,950 --> 03:51:20,110
Okay, this way.

3233
03:51:21,850 --> 03:51:23,430
Oh my god, there's the evil tree.

3234
03:51:24,390 --> 03:51:26,650
Oh my god, and the evil house behind me.

3235
03:51:26,790 --> 03:51:28,330
You can tell it's extra evil.

3236
03:51:32,770 --> 03:51:33,190
Okay.

3237
03:51:34,590 --> 03:51:35,830
Anything down here?

3238
03:51:36,110 --> 03:51:37,250
Wait, what's the point of going up?

3239
03:51:37,350 --> 03:51:37,610
Yeah.

3240
03:51:40,170 --> 03:51:41,490
The bats don't even hurt me.

3241
03:51:41,590 --> 03:51:42,510
The spiders do.

3242
03:51:46,350 --> 03:51:46,810
Whoa.

3243
03:51:47,870 --> 03:51:48,710
Oh, it was just...

3244
03:51:48,710 --> 03:51:49,850
It was just a shadow.

3245
03:51:52,950 --> 03:51:53,610
Up I go.

3246
03:51:56,230 --> 03:51:56,670
Yay!

3247
03:51:56,930 --> 03:51:57,390
$20.

3248
03:51:59,670 --> 03:52:01,250
God, I'm so rich right now.

3249
03:52:02,190 --> 03:52:04,210
Of all the $20 in the world.

3250
03:52:07,110 --> 03:52:07,570
And...

3251
03:52:07,570 --> 03:52:08,630
I'm risking it.

3252
03:52:08,690 --> 03:52:08,950
Fuck!

3253
03:52:09,130 --> 03:52:09,710
Okay, it's fine.

3254
03:52:09,830 --> 03:52:10,190
We don't need it.

3255
03:52:10,210 --> 03:52:10,610
Whoa!

3256
03:52:11,270 --> 03:52:12,290
Oh my god.

3257
03:52:12,450 --> 03:52:13,230
Oh my god.

3258
03:52:13,430 --> 03:52:14,290
Oh my god.

3259
03:52:14,470 --> 03:52:15,590
He's coming after me.

3260
03:52:15,630 --> 03:52:16,050
There's no way.

3261
03:52:16,070 --> 03:52:26,230
he goes through that that's right it's a gap in the hole what you gonna do about that

3262
03:52:30,990 --> 03:52:45,730

3263
03:52:48,950 --> 03:52:51,110
Wait, there was nothing here.

3264
03:52:53,150 --> 03:52:53,310
Huh.

3265
03:52:54,310 --> 03:52:55,970
I would assume there'd be one more film.

3266
03:52:58,870 --> 03:52:59,730
There it is.

3267
03:53:00,310 --> 03:53:01,050
And I'll go.

3268
03:53:06,010 --> 03:53:07,450
No way we share this.

3269
03:53:07,570 --> 03:53:08,850
What the fuck is that?

3270
03:53:08,990 --> 03:53:10,030
Oh, that's the murderer!

3271
03:53:10,710 --> 03:53:11,350
That's her!

3272
03:53:12,610 --> 03:53:13,530
That's the...

3273
03:53:13,530 --> 03:53:14,690
The Black Widow.

3274
03:53:18,730 --> 03:53:19,050
Money.

3275
03:53:20,550 --> 03:53:21,170
Money.

3276
03:53:22,090 --> 03:53:22,450
Alright.

3277
03:53:24,710 --> 03:53:33,630

3278
03:53:38,770 --> 03:53:55,830
these paintings are the guardians of this place we can only proceed through this room with their blessing don't worry they'll let us through I go way back with them oh what Am I just supposed to...

3279
03:53:55,830 --> 03:53:57,110
Oh, I'm supposed to remember.

3280
03:53:59,130 --> 03:53:59,910
Oh, okay.

3281
03:54:00,250 --> 03:54:01,430
Yeah, I'm supposed to remember.

3282
03:54:02,710 --> 03:54:03,590
Spin into...

3283
03:54:03,590 --> 03:54:05,050
And got to match them all.

3284
03:54:05,330 --> 03:54:06,190
Oh, that's easy.

3285
03:54:06,990 --> 03:54:07,850
It's not too hard.

3286
03:54:08,010 --> 03:54:08,970
I remembered it.

3287
03:54:10,310 --> 03:54:11,690
Okay, but what's over here, though?

3288
03:54:13,210 --> 03:54:14,930
Anything, like, interesting in here?

3289
03:54:17,710 --> 03:54:19,070
Wait, can I un-paint this?

3290
03:54:19,170 --> 03:54:19,870
Oh, I can!

3291
03:54:22,730 --> 03:54:24,390
Master Gear will activate them.

3292
03:54:25,090 --> 03:54:26,250
But what's in here, though?

3293
03:54:28,790 --> 03:54:29,310
Oh!

3294
03:54:30,930 --> 03:54:32,470
I knew it.

3295
03:54:37,120 --> 03:54:38,700
You know that Gaben retired?

3296
03:54:38,820 --> 03:54:40,520
Like, he's, like, semi-retired, right?

3297
03:54:40,560 --> 03:54:41,800
He lives on a boat now.

3298
03:54:42,200 --> 03:54:42,800
In the sea.

3299
03:54:43,140 --> 03:54:44,600
He's a boatman now.

3300
03:54:50,030 --> 03:54:52,250
Okay, so I can unpaint these.

3301
03:54:52,570 --> 03:54:52,830
Okay.

3302
03:54:53,330 --> 03:54:55,530
Yeah, he's just vibing in the sea right now.

3303
03:54:57,090 --> 03:54:57,610
Yeah.

3304
03:54:58,850 --> 03:54:59,530
Yeah, he's...

3305
03:54:59,550 --> 03:55:08,270
literally uh he's one with this he's one with the boat there's nothing in here okay what about here

3306
03:55:18,510 --> 03:55:25,850
i wonder if like i wonder if like each turn gives me like a different place

3307
03:55:34,190 --> 03:55:35,570
Let's find out.

3308
03:55:36,590 --> 03:55:39,490
Does it change, like...

3309
03:55:40,950 --> 03:55:42,210
No, it doesn't.

3310
03:55:42,350 --> 03:55:42,570
Alright.

3311
03:55:45,210 --> 03:55:47,650
Okay, let's match all of them now then.

3312
03:55:48,590 --> 03:55:50,170
Um, there's his pants.

3313
03:55:50,830 --> 03:55:52,590
And then...

3314
03:55:54,850 --> 03:55:56,470
Oh, okay.

3315
03:55:58,030 --> 03:56:01,070
Um, that's not how it should look like.

3316
03:56:03,170 --> 03:56:03,850
Um...

3317
03:56:04,870 --> 03:56:05,850
That's awesome.

3318
03:56:05,990 --> 03:56:08,030
Now how it should look like as well.

3319
03:56:09,870 --> 03:56:10,890
Um, okay.

3320
03:56:11,690 --> 03:56:13,070
And then we twist it.

3321
03:56:16,550 --> 03:56:18,710
Oh, this is...

3322
03:56:20,470 --> 03:56:24,070
This is a lot more confusing than I thought.

3323
03:56:27,490 --> 03:56:28,770
Wait, guys.

3324
03:56:29,410 --> 03:56:30,150
Oh, okay.

3325
03:56:30,210 --> 03:56:31,430
I figured it out.

3326
03:56:31,890 --> 03:56:32,990
I figured it out.

3327
03:56:33,630 --> 03:56:36,250
Okay, and then...

3328
03:56:36,250 --> 03:56:36,330
Okay.

3329
03:56:43,140 --> 03:56:43,740
Okay.

3330
03:56:44,260 --> 03:56:45,360
I figured it out.

3331
03:56:46,900 --> 03:56:49,180
Oh no, the puzzle has a puzzle.

3332
03:56:50,420 --> 03:56:50,660
Okay.

3333
03:56:55,980 --> 03:56:57,500
Okay, I figured it out.

3334
03:56:57,640 --> 03:56:58,460
I'm so smart.

3335
03:57:01,240 --> 03:57:02,080
Hurry up.

3336
03:57:04,200 --> 03:57:05,860
And then that's not the head.

3337
03:57:08,160 --> 03:57:09,460
And then there's the head.

3338
03:57:09,680 --> 03:57:10,520
We did it!

3339
03:57:11,220 --> 03:57:11,640
Yay!

3340
03:57:14,860 --> 03:57:16,220
Wait, one of the paintings?

3341
03:57:16,440 --> 03:57:16,940
Which one?

3342
03:57:19,160 --> 03:57:20,420
Which one did I do?

3343
03:57:20,940 --> 03:57:21,380
Oh, wait.

3344
03:57:23,560 --> 03:57:24,320
That's fine.

3345
03:57:24,460 --> 03:57:25,280
I just fixed it like that.

3346
03:57:25,340 --> 03:57:25,880
There you go.

3347
03:57:26,460 --> 03:57:27,860
I want to check something.

3348
03:57:29,140 --> 03:57:29,920
Oh, oh!

3349
03:57:29,960 --> 03:57:30,920
I knew it!

3350
03:57:30,960 --> 03:57:31,880
Each room!

3351
03:57:32,500 --> 03:57:34,060
Oh my god, Dono might be in here.

3352
03:57:34,180 --> 03:57:34,760
I knew it.

3353
03:57:34,780 --> 03:57:35,780
Oh my gosh, I'm so smart.

3354
03:57:36,180 --> 03:57:37,780
This is the room I fixed, by the way.

3355
03:57:38,540 --> 03:57:38,940
Okay.

3356
03:57:39,400 --> 03:57:40,380
I had a feeling.

3357
03:57:40,480 --> 03:57:41,980
Dono might be in here this time.

3358
03:57:43,440 --> 03:57:43,840
Oops.

3359
03:57:44,840 --> 03:57:45,220
Nope.

3360
03:57:46,520 --> 03:57:47,200
Is Donald in here?

3361
03:57:49,300 --> 03:57:50,880
Okay, he's not in here.

3362
03:57:53,680 --> 03:57:54,640
How about in here?

3363
03:57:55,220 --> 03:57:56,540
Donald, are you in here?

3364
03:57:57,340 --> 03:57:57,660
Buddy!

3365
03:57:59,320 --> 03:58:00,540
Buddy, where are you?

3366
03:58:02,560 --> 03:58:03,760
Okay, not here.

3367
03:58:05,600 --> 03:58:07,460
Wait, that means, like, the second step.

3368
03:58:09,420 --> 03:58:09,840
Okay.

3369
03:58:13,820 --> 03:58:14,820
Okay, this...

3372
03:58:50,640 --> 03:58:51,480
Okay, to win!

3373
03:58:54,660 --> 03:58:56,780
First Thelanus, as originally intended.

3374
03:59:00,510 --> 03:59:00,770
Yay!

3375
03:59:02,350 --> 03:59:04,030
I don't have to try!

3376
03:59:05,410 --> 03:59:08,170
Restore the classic Renaissance triangle composition.

3377
03:59:08,890 --> 03:59:09,970
Wait, I fixed this.

3378
03:59:10,450 --> 03:59:12,990
Oh my god, he ruined it so he could fix it himself.

3379
03:59:13,650 --> 03:59:14,030
Okay.

3380
03:59:16,310 --> 03:59:16,750
Excellent.

3381
03:59:16,950 --> 03:59:18,070
All paintings are lined up.

3382
03:59:18,190 --> 03:59:20,370
Just hit the gear in the middle of the room again.

3383
03:59:21,290 --> 03:59:21,870
All right, cool.

3384
03:59:21,950 --> 03:59:23,170
Wait, where the fuck am I?

3385
03:59:23,750 --> 03:59:25,650
Wait, where did he put me in?

3386
03:59:25,970 --> 03:59:28,350
What the fuck?

3387
03:59:28,690 --> 03:59:30,890
I had to find... I was trying to find Donald!

3388
03:59:33,410 --> 03:59:34,350
I did it.

3389
03:59:34,390 --> 03:59:35,350
I outsourced.

3390
03:59:35,890 --> 03:59:37,310
I outsourced it.

3391
03:59:39,350 --> 03:59:43,070
Once you're all the machinery started up, the paintings opened the door for us.

3392
03:59:43,170 --> 03:59:44,650
I told you we went way back.

3393
03:59:46,210 --> 03:59:48,290
Look, guys, I outsourced it.

3394
03:59:49,170 --> 03:59:51,270
I outsourced the work for cheap.

3395
03:59:52,010 --> 03:59:52,410
Yay!

3396
03:59:52,970 --> 03:59:54,350
Cheap labor, though.

3397
03:59:57,830 --> 03:59:58,510
Yippee!

3398
04:00:02,390 --> 04:00:05,150
Is he evil or is he good?

3399
04:00:07,210 --> 04:00:09,530
Wait, I can't even go through it!

3400
04:00:09,930 --> 04:00:12,030
What if Donald was in there?

3401
04:00:14,090 --> 04:00:16,190
Oh my god, I can't even go.

3402
04:00:16,210 --> 04:00:17,570
go through it.

3403
04:00:19,370 --> 04:00:21,470
Okay, maybe Donald wasn't in there, guys.

3404
04:00:22,070 --> 04:00:23,850
Maybe it wasn't.

3405
04:00:24,430 --> 04:00:25,470
Maybe he's okay.

3406
04:00:28,630 --> 04:00:30,710
Yeah, I'm ready to go to the library.

3407
04:00:31,010 --> 04:00:32,850
Where the fuck are his parts?

3408
04:00:40,690 --> 04:00:43,070
Like, actually, where the fuck is it?

3409
04:00:47,610 --> 04:00:48,210
Yeah.

3410
04:00:51,010 --> 04:00:52,110
Oh, whoops.

3411
04:00:53,090 --> 04:00:53,630
Oh, yeah.

3412
04:00:56,690 --> 04:01:08,850
wait there's like a switch here turn it off and then there's no fire oh my god really welcome to science

3413
04:01:13,210 --> 04:01:21,190
we'll do first this for the film all right down we go whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa don't ground me up

3414
04:01:24,690 --> 04:01:28,910
where the fuck are down in those parts Was a chicken plus Pluto?

3415
04:01:31,010 --> 04:01:33,250
Divided by...

3416
04:01:33,250 --> 04:01:36,030
Axe equals chicken Pluto.

3417
04:01:36,590 --> 04:01:37,810
Equals leg.

3418
04:01:39,630 --> 04:01:40,750
Equals...

3419
04:01:40,750 --> 04:01:41,310
Equals...

3420
04:01:41,790 --> 04:01:43,190
Equals dog?

3421
04:01:46,130 --> 04:01:49,330
The science ain't adding up, guys.

3422
04:01:52,430 --> 04:01:54,770
This ain't adding up.

3423
04:02:00,490 --> 04:02:02,030
Alright, we go this way.

3424
04:02:05,270 --> 04:02:06,250
What does this give me?

3425
04:02:06,270 --> 04:02:07,190
Does it give me another film?

3426
04:02:08,430 --> 04:02:10,550
What do the numbers mean, Doki?

3427
04:02:11,590 --> 04:02:12,610
What do they mean?

3428
04:02:14,130 --> 04:02:15,510
Be nice, another film.

3429
04:02:18,090 --> 04:02:21,170
Okay, we'll go this way, because I don't want to go in the bottom.

3430
04:02:23,030 --> 04:02:23,950
What do you mean?

3431
04:02:24,050 --> 04:02:25,630
It makes perfect sense.

3432
04:02:28,630 --> 04:02:58,690
Yeah, okay, but if you think think about it if you put the the bird on the oh the bird as the head and then the dog as the as the rest of the body you can get six chickens you can get six chickens instead of instead of one dog oh I woke up it was all just a dream it's the coma theory all over again

3433
04:03:03,270 --> 04:03:05,930
Um, by the way, Doki, have you ever watched the Twisted Metal series?

3434
04:03:06,050 --> 04:03:07,270
It's based off the game Twisted Metal.

3435
04:03:07,410 --> 04:03:09,090
I haven't watched the Twisted Metal series.

3436
04:03:09,270 --> 04:03:12,110
I know it's a voice by, what's his name?

3437
04:03:12,670 --> 04:03:13,410
What's his name?

3438
04:03:13,870 --> 04:03:15,930
Um, the guy who does Bojack Horseman.

3439
04:03:16,030 --> 04:03:16,550
Will Arnett.

3440
04:03:16,910 --> 04:03:19,730
I know it's, like, no, he's, like, the voice of the clown.

3441
04:03:20,190 --> 04:03:22,390
I've never played a Twisted Metal game before, actually.

3442
04:03:22,530 --> 04:03:23,410
I've been thinking of the Super Chat.

3443
04:03:23,530 --> 04:03:24,370
Thank you, thank you.

3444
04:03:25,710 --> 04:03:27,110
Kel, thank you for the Super Chat.

3445
04:03:27,270 --> 04:03:28,090
Thank you, thank you.

3446
04:03:28,490 --> 04:03:29,070
Hi, Doki.

3447
04:03:29,270 --> 04:03:29,430
I'm sorry.

3448
04:03:29,650 --> 04:03:32,190
I lied about it being my one-sixth and two-hour birthday.

3449
04:03:32,730 --> 04:04:04,710
a reverse happy birthday to repent for my sins now you'll never get a happy birthday think about the crimes you committed that's right that's why you should never tell the truth what thank you super chat thank you thank you that's right that's what you get for telling the truth it should have kept lying Oh,

3450
04:04:06,090 --> 04:04:07,330
I have to fix the painting.

3451
04:04:10,730 --> 04:04:12,150
What an interesting piece.

3452
04:04:13,150 --> 04:04:14,390
The consequences.

3453
04:04:20,430 --> 04:04:20,650
Alright.

3454
04:04:20,830 --> 04:04:21,650
Oh, there's his leg.

3455
04:04:21,870 --> 04:04:22,350
I found...

3456
04:04:22,350 --> 04:04:23,090
Got his leg!

3457
04:04:23,910 --> 04:04:25,550
Fucking finally found his leg.

3458
04:04:26,230 --> 04:04:26,570
Jesus.

3459
04:04:31,040 --> 04:04:31,960
What do I do here?

3460
04:04:32,280 --> 04:04:32,460
Oh.

3461
04:04:33,300 --> 04:04:33,700
What?

3462
04:04:35,640 --> 04:04:36,240
What?

3463
04:04:39,400 --> 04:04:39,960
Oh!

3464
04:04:40,760 --> 04:04:41,940
Okay, I get it.

3465
04:04:47,480 --> 04:04:49,480
Time to crawl back into the womb.

3466
04:04:49,820 --> 04:04:50,340
That's right.

3467
04:04:51,560 --> 04:04:51,960
What's in it?

3468
04:04:51,960 --> 04:04:54,280
By here, it has falling into the spirit.

3469
04:04:54,480 --> 04:04:56,020
Wait, can I just... Okay.

3470
04:04:56,600 --> 04:04:56,880
Yeah.

3471
04:04:57,600 --> 04:04:59,660
I can literally just walk through it.

3472
04:05:02,830 --> 04:05:03,730
What does this do?

3473
04:05:04,430 --> 04:05:06,150
Oh, it's less spooky now!

3474
04:05:07,290 --> 04:05:07,850
Yay!

3475
04:05:08,510 --> 04:05:10,010
I unspooked the ghost.

3476
04:05:10,550 --> 04:05:11,490
Unspokes your ghost.

3477
04:05:14,850 --> 04:05:19,630
Because the book is too bad, we had to make our way through before stopping them.

3478
04:05:19,930 --> 04:05:22,930
I bet Madame Leona can explain what's going on around here.

3479
04:05:27,040 --> 04:05:27,380
Okay.

3480
04:05:27,920 --> 04:05:29,000
Go this way.

3481
04:05:30,140 --> 04:05:31,380
Oh, there's Madame Leona!

3482
04:05:31,640 --> 04:05:33,220
It's the haunted mansion!

3483
04:05:35,120 --> 04:05:37,540
The chaos in my library must be stopped.

3484
04:05:37,980 --> 04:05:39,620
This haunting is out of control.

3485
04:05:40,280 --> 04:05:44,520
The ghost disturbing the bokehs has sent many of my prized books flying away.

3486
04:05:45,640 --> 04:05:48,760
First, you must seek out the broken souls that freed these spirits.

3487
04:05:48,920 --> 04:05:51,500
Prepare them, and the spirits will leave my bookcases.

3488
04:05:52,160 --> 04:05:55,040
Second, collect the flyaway books that are still in this room.

3489
04:05:55,620 --> 04:05:59,040
I sent Ghost Eden to Bog Easy to retrieve one of my books.

3490
04:05:59,820 --> 04:06:01,640
As suspected, he has failed me.

3491
04:06:02,020 --> 04:06:04,620
If I see him again, I shall make a bookmark of him.

3492
04:06:04,680 --> 04:06:06,960
But how do I catch a flying book?

3493
04:06:08,120 --> 04:06:10,380
Regardless of all that, restore my art collection.

3494
04:06:10,880 --> 04:06:13,440
My paintings have also fallen in a disarray.

3495
04:06:15,640 --> 04:06:18,180
in chaos, I understand you have much to attend to.

3496
04:06:18,940 --> 04:06:23,160
However, I insist that you calm the rest of spirits in the lab before I can allow you to leave.

3497
04:06:24,120 --> 04:06:24,380
Alright.

3498
04:06:29,520 --> 04:06:30,980
A little bit left.

3499
04:06:31,360 --> 04:06:31,800
Oh, hey.

3500
04:06:32,040 --> 04:06:32,640
What's this?

3501
04:06:32,980 --> 04:06:34,120
Oh, it was just nothing.

3502
04:06:35,980 --> 04:06:36,700
Where ghost...

3503
04:06:36,700 --> 04:06:38,680
She sure doesn't want things to be haunted.

3504
04:06:42,530 --> 04:06:44,310
Okay, how do I catch this ghost?

3505
04:06:45,390 --> 04:06:46,790
Do I just start painting it?

3506
04:06:47,350 --> 04:06:48,150
Oh, okay.

3507
04:06:49,130 --> 04:06:51,150
Okay, I just start painting it.

3508
04:06:51,970 --> 04:06:52,810
I was a little confused.

3509
04:06:52,970 --> 04:06:54,570
I was like, what will stop him?

3510
04:06:57,570 --> 04:06:58,690
What does this do?

3511
04:07:00,870 --> 04:07:02,830
The books, they've stopped.

3512
04:07:05,110 --> 04:07:07,030
Secret Panda concealed the scar.

3513
04:07:07,270 --> 04:07:08,150
Let's go fix it.

3514
04:07:08,330 --> 04:07:08,750
Oh, okay.

3515
04:07:08,870 --> 04:07:09,350
It's time.

3516
04:07:10,170 --> 04:07:11,010
Don't worry, I'm running.

3517
04:07:11,510 --> 04:07:12,250
I'm running.

3518
04:07:14,150 --> 04:07:15,110
I'm gonna make it.

3519
04:07:16,650 --> 04:07:17,210
Wee.

3520
04:07:24,100 --> 04:07:26,040
The spirits must really like you.

3521
04:07:26,240 --> 04:07:28,580
They shifted the bookies into a stair formation.

3522
04:07:28,980 --> 04:07:29,900
Shall we go up?

3523
04:07:30,400 --> 04:07:30,740
Yay!

3524
04:07:32,380 --> 04:07:34,600
Only one skull remains to be repaired.

3525
04:07:35,000 --> 04:07:36,660
You're doing very well, Mickey.

3526
04:07:37,700 --> 04:07:38,140
Yippee!

3527
04:07:38,680 --> 04:07:39,400
I'm a hero.

3528
04:07:41,280 --> 04:07:42,580
There's something over there, though.

3529
04:07:42,620 --> 04:07:43,660
I'm gonna go over there first.

3530
04:07:45,800 --> 04:07:47,340
Actually, let's go over there.

3531
04:07:47,540 --> 04:07:49,320
No running in my library.

3532
04:07:50,560 --> 04:07:51,480
I'm gonna run all I want.

3533
04:07:51,620 --> 04:07:52,500
I'm gonna run with scissors.

3534
04:07:59,320 --> 04:08:00,880
That's a little bit dumb.

3535
04:08:03,080 --> 04:08:04,940
Like, how is that going to crush me?

3536
04:08:07,960 --> 04:08:08,540
Oh, shit.

3537
04:08:09,480 --> 04:08:10,360
Get down from there!

3538
04:08:10,480 --> 04:08:11,360
Get down!

3539
04:08:12,540 --> 04:08:14,580
The power of the paint compels you!

3540
04:08:17,400 --> 04:08:19,000
Okay, so we gotta...

3541
04:08:19,000 --> 04:08:19,580
There we go.

3542
04:08:20,520 --> 04:08:22,460
Where the fuck do I hit that?

3543
04:08:23,340 --> 04:08:24,280
Oh, there it is.

3544
04:08:24,380 --> 04:08:26,360
Wait, what side is this supposed to be?

3545
04:08:26,500 --> 04:08:26,820
Okay.

3546
04:08:28,080 --> 04:08:28,520

3547
04:08:30,040 --> 04:09:00,220

You know what?

3549
04:09:00,680 --> 04:09:01,240
Yeah, fuck it.

3550
04:09:01,260 --> 04:09:01,940
I'm outsourcing.

3551
04:09:07,640 --> 04:09:08,100
There you go.

3552
04:09:08,240 --> 04:09:08,860
It was easy.

3553
04:09:09,040 --> 04:09:10,540
I'm an excellent flyer.

3554
04:09:11,160 --> 04:09:11,180
Bye.

3555
04:09:11,340 --> 04:09:12,520
I did it, guys.

3556
04:09:14,060 --> 04:09:16,640
For one that shared my love for books, return to me.

3557
04:09:16,700 --> 04:09:17,460
And it's yours.

3558
04:09:17,720 --> 04:09:18,440
I did it, guys.

3559
04:09:18,600 --> 04:09:19,220
I outsource.

3560
04:09:23,610 --> 04:09:24,730
Outsource for cheap.

3561
04:09:25,230 --> 04:09:26,410
Reap the profits.

3562
04:09:26,810 --> 04:09:27,250
Exactly.

3563
04:09:27,950 --> 04:09:29,370
It's not a crime.

04:10:07,710 --> 04:10:22,570

04:10:33,550 --> 04:11:02,330
was Philippines and Nigeria and one more country I forgot which one and then they were apparently making like two dollars an hour while like uh while the uh wait oh my gosh let me get past this this time a lot of company itself were making like 40k 40k K per day.

3569
04:11:02,990 --> 04:11:03,610
Or not even 4K.

3570
04:11:03,650 --> 04:11:05,650
I think it was 100 K per day or some shit.

3571
04:11:06,410 --> 04:11:07,110
It's crazy.

3572
04:11:10,690 --> 04:11:11,330
Alright.

3573
04:11:12,390 --> 04:11:15,910
And the employees were making like $2 an hour.

3574
04:11:16,870 --> 04:11:17,390
That's just...

3575
04:11:17,390 --> 04:11:18,950
No, that's not Disney.

3576
04:11:21,230 --> 04:11:23,370
And they were like outsourcing...

3577
04:11:23,370 --> 04:11:26,810
They were like outsourcing tow trucks.

3578
04:11:29,770 --> 04:11:30,910
That's crazy.

3579
04:11:30,910 --> 04:11:34,230
When I was, like, reading about that scab, it was fucking crazy.

3580
04:11:34,970 --> 04:11:36,650
Can I just encase him in the bookshelf?

3581
04:11:40,320 --> 04:11:42,000
And we got this guy.

3582
04:11:43,900 --> 04:11:44,760
And him.

3583
04:11:45,160 --> 04:11:46,100
Oh, wait, there's the hatchet.

3584
04:11:46,160 --> 04:11:47,100
There's the murder weapon.

3585
04:11:47,300 --> 04:11:47,860
Let's go.

3586
04:11:48,500 --> 04:11:49,720
We got you now.

3587
04:11:50,960 --> 04:11:52,860
We have the murder weapon, Leona.

3588
04:11:53,940 --> 04:11:54,760
That's right.

3589
04:11:56,720 --> 04:11:58,540
That's remained unsolved for ages.

3590
04:11:58,680 --> 04:11:59,840
We should take it back to Horace.

3591
04:11:59,980 --> 04:12:00,940
He'll know more about it.

3592
04:12:01,160 --> 04:12:02,180
That's right, Leona.

3593
04:12:02,700 --> 04:12:03,960
Your days are numbered!

3594
04:12:04,560 --> 04:12:05,980
I got the murder weapon!

3595
04:12:08,880 --> 04:12:10,720
It was such an interesting video.

3596
04:12:11,360 --> 04:12:17,280
Like, they basically, they, they, like, they just pay Google to be on top of the Google search.

3597
04:12:17,580 --> 04:12:18,520
Like, not, was it Google?

3598
04:12:18,900 --> 04:12:19,260
What is it?

3599
04:12:19,300 --> 04:12:23,680
They pay, like, someone to, like, so they could be, like, on top of the Google searches.

3600
04:12:23,800 --> 04:12:28,620
So when you search up for, like, you know, you know, when your car breaks down, you search for, like, tow truck services.

3601
04:12:28,980 --> 04:13:24,420
So they pay, like, they pay to have their their website they have like multiple websites set up in different part in different states where uh they the first results would be like their company and they set up like multiple companies multiple like pages and stuff many thanks fellas i promise to return the favor somewhere down the line and then so that you call them first and then they'll just out and then they'll like charge double the price of like other to like the actual tow truck companies i promise to favor somewhere down the line for now to stay out of leona's sight she doesn't care much for me see you soon yeah that's crazy i wonder how do you do that so i can be like how do i pay google searches so when you type dtuber i'll be the number one answer it's so interesting though

3602
04:13:36,980 --> 04:13:39,020
I wonder how you do that.

3603
04:13:39,180 --> 04:13:41,260
How do you become, like, number one result?

3604
04:13:41,640 --> 04:13:44,140
And, wait, that's big brain, damn.

3605
04:13:46,240 --> 04:13:48,480
Make myself a sponsored link.

3606
04:13:51,440 --> 04:13:54,220
Yeah, I caught all of my flyaway books.

3607
04:13:54,380 --> 04:13:54,720
Thank you.

3608
04:13:54,760 --> 04:13:56,880
Here, have the silver pin for your troubles.

3609
04:14:00,460 --> 04:14:02,120
Catch the flying books.

3610
04:14:02,140 --> 04:14:03,240
Yeah, I did it.

3611
04:14:03,620 --> 04:14:04,940
Yeah, restored my art collection.

3612
04:14:05,080 --> 04:14:05,480
Thank you.

3613
04:14:05,540 --> 04:14:06,720
Please accept this pin.

3614
04:14:07,160 --> 04:14:10,360
One awarded, only to those with true appreciation of fine art.

3615
04:14:13,890 --> 04:14:14,270
Okay.

3616
04:14:16,710 --> 04:14:17,850
Yeah, I played my...

3617
04:14:17,850 --> 04:14:19,510
Called my restless bookcases.

3618
04:14:19,710 --> 04:14:20,430
I did it.

3619
04:14:20,510 --> 04:14:22,410
I did everything you won, Leona.

3620
04:14:23,610 --> 04:14:24,850
Now, let me in.

3621
04:14:28,190 --> 04:14:28,930
Here's what...

3622
04:14:28,930 --> 04:14:29,850
What the fuck?

3623
04:14:32,010 --> 04:14:33,130
Here, this is...

3624
04:14:33,130 --> 04:14:34,470
Like, where did he come from?

3625
04:14:34,530 --> 04:14:34,950
He just...

3626
04:14:34,970 --> 04:14:37,110
Drop down from the fucking sky.

3627
04:14:37,950 --> 04:14:39,650
I have to get through that slumber.

3628
04:14:40,210 --> 04:14:43,010
After kind deeds, I cannot allow this evil to befall you.

3629
04:14:43,410 --> 04:14:47,950
I'll channel the mystic energies and use them to dispel that disgusting creature.

3630
04:14:48,530 --> 04:14:50,390
Melt him away in a way he will stay.

3631
04:14:50,470 --> 04:14:51,750
Wait, that's not good, though!

3632
04:14:52,030 --> 04:14:52,490
No!

3633
04:14:52,710 --> 04:14:53,110
Leona!

3634
04:14:53,390 --> 04:14:53,990
No!

3635
04:14:55,230 --> 04:14:55,730
Stop!

3636
04:14:57,610 --> 04:14:58,130
No!

3637
04:14:59,670 --> 04:15:00,270
Wait!

3638
04:15:02,710 --> 04:15:04,010
They're good riddance.

3639
04:15:04,970 --> 04:15:06,190
Oh my god.

3640
04:15:06,930 --> 04:15:08,710
Did I do a bad thing?

3641
04:15:09,090 --> 04:15:10,070
Helping her?

3642
04:15:13,030 --> 04:15:14,170
Oh, that...

3643
04:15:14,550 --> 04:15:15,550
Oh, no.

3644
04:15:16,770 --> 04:15:17,850
Oh, no.

3645
04:15:21,110 --> 04:15:22,930
Wait, she killed him.

3646
04:15:24,590 --> 04:15:24,990
Wait.

3647
04:15:26,270 --> 04:15:28,410
Was that supposed to happen?

3648
04:15:30,550 --> 04:15:31,310
I...

3649
04:15:31,310 --> 04:15:33,050
I don't know.

3650
04:15:33,350 --> 04:15:36,390
I don't know if he was supposed to kill me.

3651
04:15:38,190 --> 04:16:02,850
I don't know That seems That's not my fault right It's not my fault I can't be I can't be implicit to this crime She killed him Not me She killed him Not me I'm killed by a associate I wasn't looking I turned away What happened?

3653
04:16:38,650 --> 04:16:39,390
I might be fine.

3654
04:16:40,050 --> 04:16:41,890
I didn't I didn't kill him.

3655
04:16:42,110 --> 04:16:52,490
She did Oh, hey, there's a dancing skeleton spooky scary skeleton Come on send shivers down my spine

3656
04:16:58,950 --> 04:17:01,170
Oh my god, look at them.

3657
04:17:01,390 --> 04:17:13,210
They're all partying Look at them go Or maybe restart from the beginning just to be safe.

3658
04:17:13,750 --> 04:17:15,450
Yay, more Mickey.

3659
04:17:17,270 --> 04:17:18,950
Wait, that's the ending already.

3660
04:17:19,710 --> 04:17:21,570
Must be like other stuff down here, right?

3661
04:17:22,690 --> 04:17:23,190
Ow.

3662
04:17:23,730 --> 04:17:25,730
Okay, these spiders don't hurt though, so it's fine.

3663
04:17:27,530 --> 04:17:28,190
Okay, nice.

3664
04:17:28,370 --> 04:17:28,630
Ow.

3665
04:17:30,690 --> 04:17:33,750
I'm just trying to find any more films.

3666
04:17:33,850 --> 04:17:34,470
Okay, I knew it.

3667
04:17:35,290 --> 04:17:36,990
I knew there was another film.

3668
04:17:37,010 --> 04:17:37,770
them down here.

3669
04:17:44,050 --> 04:17:45,550
And then we'll just go this way.

3670
04:17:46,870 --> 04:17:49,210
Look at all these spooky, scary spiders.

3671
04:17:51,050 --> 04:17:52,090
Alright, we can go now.

3672
04:17:54,490 --> 04:17:55,290
Yeah, I'm ready.

3673
04:17:57,290 --> 04:18:01,610
I'm still missing so many body parts of Donald, but I swear to God, I haven't found any.

3674
04:18:02,450 --> 04:18:03,690
I only found like one.

3675
04:18:05,230 --> 04:18:07,750
Oh, there's the scary, the the scary organ.

3676
04:18:10,210 --> 04:18:11,490
A pipe organ is malfunctioned.

3677
04:18:11,630 --> 04:18:14,110
I fix him, but steam power is not my specialty.

3678
04:18:14,750 --> 04:18:15,490
Shall we help him?

3679
04:18:15,610 --> 04:18:17,110
We have to climb those pipes anyway.

3680
04:18:17,650 --> 04:18:18,270
How do we help?

3681
04:18:18,270 --> 04:18:20,130
How do we help a piano?

3682
04:18:22,570 --> 04:18:24,590
Top won't be easy if he's agitated.

3683
04:18:25,550 --> 04:18:25,970
Be careful.

3684
04:18:26,210 --> 04:18:29,590
Striking a sour water note with this fella could be your swan song.

3685
04:18:30,290 --> 04:18:31,370
How do I help him?

3686
04:18:32,890 --> 04:18:34,810
How do I help something that's evil?

3687
04:18:35,830 --> 04:18:36,590
That's mad.

3688
04:18:36,610 --> 04:18:38,910
Be a little grumpy right now.

3689
04:18:40,230 --> 04:18:40,650
Okay.

3690
04:18:42,510 --> 04:18:43,850
Alright, we gotta use...

3691
04:18:43,850 --> 04:18:45,130
Okay, we have zero anvils.

3692
04:18:45,390 --> 04:18:45,770
How the...

3693
04:18:45,770 --> 04:18:46,890
Okay, we have zero anvils.

3694
04:18:47,130 --> 04:18:47,670
That's not good.

3695
04:18:48,370 --> 04:18:50,150
There has to be an anvil hidden somewhere.

3696
04:18:52,410 --> 04:18:54,130
How do I get anvils then?

3697
04:18:55,910 --> 04:18:57,210
Is there anvil here?

3698
04:18:58,430 --> 04:18:58,950
Anvil!

3699
04:19:01,330 --> 04:19:02,510
Anvil, don't go!

3700
04:19:04,650 --> 04:19:06,530
Where are my fucking anvils?

3701
04:19:09,190 --> 04:19:10,070
Assist.

3702
04:19:10,290 --> 04:19:11,530
Will you help me?

3703
04:19:14,690 --> 04:19:15,210
Sure.

3704
04:19:24,840 --> 04:19:25,460
Am I...

3705
04:19:28,530 --> 04:19:31,610
I think that's a good thing?

3706
04:19:33,050 --> 04:19:34,890
Am I doing a good thing?

3707
04:19:41,490 --> 04:19:42,990
Am I doing...

3708
04:19:42,990 --> 04:19:43,410
What do you mean?

3709
04:19:43,450 --> 04:19:43,910
Oh, no.

3710
04:19:46,930 --> 04:19:48,690
Take this.

3711
04:19:48,710 --> 04:20:15,430

3712
04:20:20,790 --> 04:20:23,530
okay I don't have an anvil

3713
04:20:26,850 --> 04:20:35,510
how the fuck do I get anvils I don't know right from wrong oh my god

3714
04:20:40,280 --> 04:20:53,400
I mean the music sounded pretty evil but maybe it's just you know maybe that's just his taste you know maybe he's not naive It's just, he just likes to, just likes a little bit of evil in his music.

3715
04:20:53,600 --> 04:20:55,820
That doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing.

3716
04:20:56,440 --> 04:20:58,840
Some people just have different taste in music.

3717
04:21:00,580 --> 04:21:05,600
Mickey is a very ambiguous character, morally ambiguous character.

3718
04:21:06,480 --> 04:21:07,420
Oh wait, there you go.

3719
04:21:07,580 --> 04:21:08,700
Maybe if I kill him.

3720
04:21:11,760 --> 04:21:12,980
Okay, there you go.

3721
04:21:14,020 --> 04:21:15,760
He'll give me, he'll give me an anvil.

3722
04:21:16,720 --> 04:21:17,900
Maybe he has anvils.

3723
04:21:19,960 --> 04:21:21,280
Strip the robot!

3724
04:21:23,940 --> 04:21:26,840
Get dressed so I can strip you.

3725
04:21:28,540 --> 04:21:29,580
Do you have anvil?

3726
04:21:29,800 --> 04:21:30,840
Okay, yes, he does.

3727
04:21:31,660 --> 04:21:32,880
Alright, we got anvil, guys.

3728
04:21:36,870 --> 04:21:39,130
We need to find another spot.

3729
04:21:39,330 --> 04:21:40,210
Oh, there's his arm.

3730
04:21:41,190 --> 04:21:42,430
Damn, dokey.

3731
04:21:43,410 --> 04:21:44,250
We got his arm.

3732
04:21:44,610 --> 04:21:45,330
Got your arm.

3733
04:21:46,970 --> 04:21:48,510
There's another spot right here.

3734
04:21:49,710 --> 04:21:50,250
Oh, nice.

3735
04:21:50,270 --> 04:21:51,110
We needed that.

3736
04:21:51,290 --> 04:21:52,630
We needed to get him.

3737
04:21:53,570 --> 04:21:55,470
Thinking it's true that what everyone says.

3738
04:21:55,730 --> 04:21:57,290
Well, everyone except Oswald, anyway.

3739
04:21:58,150 --> 04:21:58,610
What's the matter?

3740
04:21:58,630 --> 04:22:01,290
Oh my god, now we got Anvil sketches.

3741
04:22:01,850 --> 04:22:01,850
Okay.

3742
04:22:04,350 --> 04:22:07,650
Okay, now we get Anvil sketches.

3743
04:22:08,630 --> 04:22:08,910
Alright.

3744
04:22:09,190 --> 04:22:10,270
It's like down here.

3745
04:22:10,350 --> 04:22:12,390
I don't actually know what these Anvil does.

3746
04:22:13,870 --> 04:22:14,430
So...

3747
04:22:14,430 --> 04:22:15,870
So let's see.

3748
04:22:21,570 --> 04:22:22,130
Alright.

3749
04:22:27,810 --> 04:22:29,570
Possessed tables.

3750
04:22:36,790 --> 04:22:37,530
Why?

3751
04:22:38,250 --> 04:22:40,370
Why are my tables possessed?

3752
04:22:42,430 --> 04:22:45,350
I don't understand.

3753
04:22:50,860 --> 04:22:51,560
What's...

3754
04:22:52,900 --> 04:22:54,180
What's the point?

3755
04:22:57,610 --> 04:22:59,970
Why are my tables possessed?

3756
04:23:01,770 --> 04:23:03,650
I don't...

3757
04:23:04,390 --> 04:23:05,630
What...

3758
04:23:07,350 --> 04:23:08,810
What's the point?

3759
04:23:09,610 --> 04:23:10,650
Oh, it's...

3760
04:23:11,610 --> 04:23:13,170
Why are they flying?

3761
04:23:17,370 --> 04:23:21,970
Please explain why I have possessed tables.

3762
04:23:24,890 --> 04:23:26,090
Up we go.

3763
04:23:29,450 --> 04:23:32,150
Meant to get you to the second section before the...

3764
04:23:32,150 --> 04:23:32,570
Oh.

3765
04:23:33,650 --> 04:23:34,930
Oh, that's awkward.

3766
04:23:35,330 --> 04:23:35,630
Oh.

3767
04:23:35,650 --> 04:23:39,390
Did I do an evil thing by playing the music?

3768
04:23:39,710 --> 04:23:40,770
Did I...

3769
04:23:40,770 --> 04:23:41,210
Oh.

3770
04:23:42,170 --> 04:23:42,850
Wait.

3771
04:23:44,330 --> 04:23:44,790
No.

3772
04:23:47,730 --> 04:23:49,090
Surely not.

3773
04:23:50,010 --> 04:23:50,270
Right?

3774
04:23:53,510 --> 04:23:54,190
No.

3775
04:23:55,090 --> 04:23:55,190
Wait.

3776
04:23:58,110 --> 04:24:00,250
With that, you have my gratitude.

3777
04:24:01,210 --> 04:24:02,570
I may be small, but...

3778
04:24:02,570 --> 04:24:05,010
Or small, I'll strike a blow against the mad doctor.

3779
04:24:05,650 --> 04:24:10,510
free wait do we i want him to punch the doctor

3780
04:24:13,590 --> 04:24:16,590
is that bad beating up a nerd is that

3781
04:24:21,610 --> 04:24:39,470
the organ didn't mean evil right i don't know do i pay him to salios salios bump bump See, but yes, it's bad.

3782
04:24:39,930 --> 04:24:43,150
But, like, I'm not the one beating him.

3783
04:24:43,430 --> 04:24:48,870
I don't know.

3784
04:24:49,130 --> 04:24:50,310
Do I give him $100?

3785
04:24:53,750 --> 04:24:54,310
I...

3786
04:24:54,310 --> 04:24:54,730
Okay.

3787
04:24:56,110 --> 04:24:56,450
Okay.

3788
04:24:56,970 --> 04:24:58,310
Here, here's $100.

3789
04:24:58,890 --> 04:24:59,490
Here you go.

3790
04:25:00,630 --> 04:25:03,790
I don't think it's a bad thing to let him...

3791
04:25:03,790 --> 04:25:05,630
Maybe it's not that bad.

3792
04:25:05,650 --> 04:25:06,450
bad.

3793
04:25:07,870 --> 04:25:10,570
Guys, maybe it's not that bad.

3794
04:25:11,270 --> 04:25:11,630
Celius.

3795
04:25:12,850 --> 04:25:17,750
Oh no.

3796
04:25:19,050 --> 04:25:19,770
Oh no.

3797
04:25:20,410 --> 04:25:21,010
I don't know.

3798
04:25:21,150 --> 04:25:24,990
He wanted to play the piano, so I play the piano.

3799
04:25:26,750 --> 04:25:28,370
How was I supposed to know?

3800
04:25:28,430 --> 04:25:30,250
I don't know if it's good or not.

3801
04:25:30,370 --> 04:25:31,630
This is morally ambiguous.

3802
04:25:35,950 --> 04:25:39,650
It's so morally ambiguous, I don't know!

3803
04:25:43,090 --> 04:25:46,650
Stellius, Stellius, God, those Stellius...

3804
04:25:48,970 --> 04:25:49,190
Okay.

3805
04:25:51,510 --> 04:25:54,030
I mean, it stopped playing evil music!

3806
04:25:54,770 --> 04:25:56,290
So it can't be that bad!

3807
04:25:56,930 --> 04:25:59,090
The music, evil music stopped!

3808
04:26:01,370 --> 04:26:04,010
The more unpingity the beating up...

3809
04:26:04,010 --> 04:26:05,330
He's a bad nerd!

3810
04:26:06,550 --> 04:26:49,210
he's not good nerd he's a very bad man like it's not like okay like some of these choices some of these choices are easier like do you want to give a veteran PTSD or not and then we get this it's stopping the evil is like playing an evil song on the evil organ to stop the evil music good or bad like how how do what I know how I play the evil music but he stopped playing more evil music I is beating up is beating up a doctor who may or may not be like mentally ill but is doing a lot of evil things bad or good.

3811
04:26:49,510 --> 04:27:00,670
Like how am I supposed to know it's morally ambiguous yes I'm beating him up yes he may or may not be crazy slash mentally ill but he did a lot of bad things so like is it bad or good?

3812
04:27:00,850 --> 04:27:01,570
I don't know.

3813
04:27:01,930 --> 04:27:02,750
I don't know.

3814
04:27:02,750 --> 04:27:25,450
He doesn't have mad in his name Like, I don't know This won't hold up in court That's actually a fair point Ready to go to the lonesome manner And follow your heart

3815
04:27:31,810 --> 04:27:37,630
Alright Alright Alright Ooh, there's like squishy sounds I mean, it doesn't, it's not great.

3816
04:27:45,020 --> 04:27:45,540
Okay.

3817
04:27:47,320 --> 04:27:48,140
Oh, yeah.

3818
04:27:50,080 --> 04:27:53,440
My favorite philosopher, Epic Mickey.

3819
04:27:56,400 --> 04:27:58,760
Wait, is this like, I knew it.

3820
04:27:58,820 --> 04:28:00,080
I knew that was a hidden exit.

3821
04:28:00,280 --> 04:28:00,900
Look at them.

3822
04:28:00,980 --> 04:28:02,380
They're all dancing for me.

3823
04:28:04,340 --> 04:28:08,160
It's hitting a mentally ill insane man in the face of me.

3824
04:28:08,180 --> 04:28:10,060
Morally correct.

3825
04:28:15,170 --> 04:28:16,930
Am I supposed to...

3826
04:28:16,930 --> 04:28:17,950
Okay, it's this way.

3827
04:28:22,240 --> 04:28:22,760
No!

3828
04:28:23,400 --> 04:28:24,420
Wait, will they respawn?

3829
04:28:24,600 --> 04:28:24,840
Ow.

3830
04:28:27,440 --> 04:28:27,820
That's...

3831
04:28:27,820 --> 04:28:28,620
Oh, yeah, it respawns.

3832
04:28:28,720 --> 04:28:29,180
Okay, that's good.

3833
04:28:29,520 --> 04:28:29,920
Ow!

3834
04:28:30,260 --> 04:28:30,640
Grandma!

3835
04:28:32,380 --> 04:28:33,640
That's not cool, Grandma.

3836
04:28:36,500 --> 04:28:37,620
Okay, scary.

3837
04:28:44,200 --> 04:28:45,220
Yeah, I made it.

3838
04:28:45,220 --> 04:28:46,760
I just barely made it.

3839
04:28:47,860 --> 04:28:50,900
Okay, there better be a goddamn film right over here.

3840
04:28:55,790 --> 04:28:57,790
Alright, let's see if I'll make this jump.

3841
04:29:00,150 --> 04:29:01,030
Wait, what was the point?

3842
04:29:04,110 --> 04:29:06,110
Oh my god, there was no point.

3843
04:29:07,230 --> 04:29:09,890
There was actual no point.

3844
04:29:11,890 --> 04:29:13,670
It was not worth it.

3845
04:29:14,050 --> 04:29:15,710
For the adventure, dokey.

3846
04:29:16,350 --> 04:29:16,570
Wait.

3847
04:29:20,470 --> 04:29:21,350
It's for it.

3848
04:29:21,450 --> 04:29:23,030
Where's your sense of adventure?

3849
04:29:25,250 --> 04:29:26,390
Is he doing there?

3850
04:29:27,810 --> 04:29:28,630
Anything back here?

3851
04:29:28,810 --> 04:29:29,490
Oh my god.

3852
04:29:31,150 --> 04:29:32,970
For the love of the game.

3853
04:29:34,730 --> 04:29:34,970
Okay.

3854
04:29:35,830 --> 04:29:36,310
Yes.

3855
04:29:42,210 --> 04:29:43,250
Yeah, they give us a super chat.

3856
04:29:43,390 --> 04:29:44,010
Thank you, thank you.

3857
04:29:44,070 --> 04:29:45,790
Hey, Doki, it's my unbirthday.

3858
04:29:46,030 --> 04:29:48,230
Can I get a happy unbirthday?

3859
04:29:48,790 --> 04:29:49,150
Of course.

3860
04:29:49,390 --> 04:29:50,250
Now crawl back.

3861
04:29:54,700 --> 04:29:55,700
It's fine.

3862
04:29:55,960 --> 04:29:57,220
I don't need that film.

3863
04:29:59,980 --> 04:30:00,040
Ha!

3864
04:30:00,240 --> 04:30:02,840
You're persistent, but there's no way you'll make it through this attic.

3865
04:30:05,300 --> 04:30:05,820
TV.

3866
04:30:06,720 --> 04:30:07,060
Step.

3867
04:30:13,450 --> 04:30:14,230
What the fuck?

3868
04:30:15,870 --> 04:30:16,770
Through the attic.

3869
04:30:18,730 --> 04:30:20,450
He'll be able to create an endless supply.

3870
04:30:21,970 --> 04:30:24,310
You can't get to the mad doctor.

3871
04:30:29,110 --> 04:30:59,230
if we could use the tracks to our advantage like i promise i'm here to return the favor for finding and releasing me i'm afraid of madame leona but i think the mad the mad doctor is a let my trusty ranch dismantle one of those irritating beetleworks generators for you okay okay so if i don't jam the machines um Everything will be okay.

3872
04:31:00,170 --> 04:31:01,010
Oh, shit.

3873
04:31:01,270 --> 04:31:01,490
Okay.

3874
04:31:03,870 --> 04:31:04,390
All right.

3875
04:31:05,250 --> 04:31:06,630
It's no match for us.

3876
04:31:07,050 --> 04:31:08,170
Stop calling me, Doc.

3877
04:31:08,490 --> 04:31:10,570
I'll find a way to stop you, Mickey.

3878
04:31:11,590 --> 04:31:12,710
Mr. Broken Bond.

3879
04:31:12,830 --> 04:31:13,650
Thank you for the super chat.

3880
04:31:13,710 --> 04:31:14,270
Thank you.

3881
04:31:14,270 --> 04:31:14,530
Thank you.

3882
04:31:14,690 --> 04:31:21,410
The stream will be shown in an ethics philosophy, physiology class about overthinking simple moral questions.

3883
04:31:22,010 --> 04:31:24,170
Two more BetoWorks generators left.

3884
04:31:26,670 --> 04:31:27,150
promise.

3885
04:31:27,970 --> 04:31:29,590
Gremlin's stuff this will now deliver.

3886
04:31:29,770 --> 04:31:32,690
Watch as reduce this Bidowork's generator to a useless hulk.

3887
04:31:35,350 --> 04:31:38,870
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

3888
04:31:42,470 --> 04:31:44,190
Okay, I got rid of him.

3889
04:31:45,810 --> 04:31:47,210
Alright, he's down.

3890
04:31:50,790 --> 04:31:52,530
Mickey can't be stopped when he's on a road.

3891
04:31:52,770 --> 04:31:56,030
It's a mad dog your Bidowork's army, you wretched Gremlin.

3892
04:31:56,270 --> 04:31:56,710
Get it, right?

3893
04:31:56,730 --> 04:32:23,550
just one more generator okay it's just one more to go surely if it's okay everything will be okay i just need to figure out how if i don't kill any of them it should be fine okay i have to fix this okay how do i fix it

3894
04:32:29,150 --> 04:32:37,070
attracts and then it'll be fine if i don't kill maybe if i don't kill the robots

3895
04:32:40,810 --> 04:32:47,510
right if i don't kill the robots then i'm not doing a bad thing

3896
04:32:50,750 --> 04:33:00,610
question mark it's not bad if i i i i don't kill Kill him?

3897
04:33:02,830 --> 04:33:04,610
Okay, things will be okay.

3898
04:33:06,890 --> 04:33:08,330
We gotta restore the tracks.

3899
04:33:09,630 --> 04:33:09,930
Somehow.

3900
04:33:10,270 --> 04:33:11,090
Oh, wait, there's his torso.

3901
04:33:11,370 --> 04:33:12,230
Wait, I found his torso.

3902
04:33:13,010 --> 04:33:13,790
Don't worry, Donald.

3903
04:33:14,070 --> 04:33:14,970
I got your ass.

3904
04:33:18,050 --> 04:33:19,430
Got your ass.

3905
04:33:20,410 --> 04:33:20,730
Nice.

3906
04:33:21,790 --> 04:33:22,410
Got it.

3907
04:33:23,130 --> 04:33:23,930
Is that everything?

3908
04:33:30,260 --> 04:33:31,420
And try...

3909
04:33:31,420 --> 04:33:32,020
Okay.

3910
04:33:32,640 --> 04:33:33,640
If I...

3911
04:33:34,200 --> 04:33:35,080
Wait, no, I did.

3912
04:33:36,040 --> 04:33:37,000
I smooth things over.

3913
04:33:39,020 --> 04:33:40,800
Okay, okay, the red...

3914
04:33:40,800 --> 04:33:42,460
The other part might be with Donald.

3915
04:33:43,060 --> 04:33:43,880
What the fuck?

3916
04:33:44,160 --> 04:33:45,020

3917
04:33:45,020 --> 04:33:46,620

You know that.

3921
04:33:56,990 --> 04:33:59,390

3929
04:34:29,940 --> 04:34:31,720
What the fuck did I do with the TV?

3930
04:34:34,900 --> 04:34:36,220
Did I do anything?

3931
04:34:38,080 --> 04:34:39,040

04:35:35,690 --> 04:35:36,670
Oh, it's over here.

3941
04:35:40,160 --> 04:35:41,420
I just need to step on it.

3942
04:35:43,440 --> 04:35:44,560
What did I do?

3943
04:35:46,640 --> 04:35:47,820
What the fuck?

3944
04:35:47,980 --> 04:35:48,740
I don't know.

3945
04:35:50,480 --> 04:35:52,440
I'll never know what I do.

3946
04:35:54,720 --> 04:35:55,700
That's the thing.

3947
04:35:55,820 --> 04:35:56,320
I just...

3948
04:35:56,320 --> 04:35:56,920
I don't know.

3949
04:35:56,940 --> 04:36:00,400
Oh my god, there's the evil queen.

3950
04:36:02,280 --> 04:36:02,500
Okay.

3951
04:36:03,480 --> 04:36:05,880
I need to make sure I don't kill any of them.

3952
04:36:07,700 --> 04:36:08,060
Ow.

3953
04:36:09,280 --> 04:36:10,480
It's okay, I can dodge it.

3954
04:36:11,140 --> 04:36:11,800
I'm gaming.

3955
04:36:13,820 --> 04:36:14,780
I just press buttons.

3956
04:36:14,900 --> 04:36:15,640
That's all I do.

3957
04:36:18,420 --> 04:36:21,460
I'm like trying to figure out how to like make sure...

3958
04:36:22,000 --> 04:36:24,780
I have to lower this track, but like how do I...

3959
04:36:24,780 --> 04:36:25,920
Oh, no.

3960
04:36:27,180 --> 04:36:29,620
Where is this track connected to?

3961
04:36:31,820 --> 04:36:33,120
I never know.

3962
04:36:33,240 --> 04:36:34,200
That's my little secret.

3963
04:36:35,920 --> 04:36:36,940
Like, how do I...

3964
04:36:37,500 --> 04:36:38,680
Unattach this?

3965
04:36:43,050 --> 04:36:44,950
I can't unpaint it.

3966
04:36:46,830 --> 04:36:47,210
Here?

3967
04:36:47,430 --> 04:36:48,670
I can unpaint this, right?

3968
04:36:49,050 --> 04:36:49,410
No?

3969
04:36:53,470 --> 04:36:55,350
How do I unpaint you?

3970
04:36:56,550 --> 04:36:57,530
What the fuck?

3971
04:37:02,000 --> 04:37:04,320
How the fuck do I unpaint you?

3972
04:37:10,050 --> 04:37:11,490
Like, it's just there.

3973
04:37:12,190 --> 04:37:12,890
Oh, is that a button?

3974
04:37:13,010 --> 04:37:14,290
No, that's not a button.

3975
04:37:16,750 --> 04:37:19,210
Unpaints your thing.

3976
04:37:20,510 --> 04:37:21,410
Yeah, it's just there.

3977
04:37:21,610 --> 04:37:22,850
It won't let me unpaint it.

3978
04:37:23,630 --> 04:37:27,090
I just need to lower this, but I don't know where that is connected to.

3979
04:37:29,310 --> 04:37:30,490
It's just one thing.

3980
04:37:30,670 --> 04:37:32,050
It's literally this one thing.

3981
04:37:35,840 --> 04:37:36,640
Was there a wheel?

3982
04:37:37,260 --> 04:37:38,480
I don't see no wheel.

3983
04:37:39,520 --> 04:37:42,440
That's where I found Donald's ass right there.

3984
04:37:46,610 --> 04:37:47,650
I'm so lost.

3985
04:37:51,860 --> 04:37:53,800
I'm trying to figure this out, guys.

3986
04:37:57,680 --> 04:37:59,000
I pressed all the buttons.

3987
04:37:59,200 --> 04:37:59,880
What more is there?

3988
04:38:00,120 --> 04:38:01,480
What more do I have to press?

3989
04:38:02,420 --> 04:38:03,720
I pressed them on.

3990
04:38:05,500 --> 04:38:07,200
It's all powered up.

3991
04:38:09,620 --> 04:38:11,500
Probably a switch on the wall.

3992
04:38:17,460 --> 04:38:18,540
Okay, maybe.

3993
04:38:18,560 --> 04:38:18,820
me.

3994
04:38:19,800 --> 04:38:20,740
It's literally this.

3995
04:38:20,860 --> 04:38:22,540
This is literally the one thing.

3996
04:38:23,580 --> 04:38:25,140
I'd be like, is there anything here?

3997
04:38:25,580 --> 04:38:25,880
No.

3998
04:38:27,460 --> 04:38:28,580
Yeah, there's nothing here.

3999
04:38:28,860 --> 04:38:31,080
Like, I need this to jump up there.

4000
04:38:32,960 --> 04:38:34,500
Oh my god, I'm so confused.

4001
04:38:35,160 --> 04:38:36,300
What could it be?

4002
04:38:38,200 --> 04:38:38,980
I did.

4003
04:38:39,120 --> 04:38:39,840
This was a TV.

4004
04:38:41,160 --> 04:38:42,800
I used a TV for this.

4005
04:38:42,860 --> 04:38:43,880
I powered it up.

4006
04:38:45,440 --> 04:38:47,380
And then I pressed this button.

4007
04:38:48,560 --> 04:39:04,630

04:39:29,520 --> 04:39:31,740
But I pressed this button, too.

4011
04:39:34,240 --> 04:39:36,360
It's literally this platform!

4012
04:39:36,880 --> 04:39:37,600
Oh my god.

4013
04:39:37,760 --> 04:39:39,300
Where the fuck is up?

4014
04:39:41,840 --> 04:39:44,200
How do I deal with this platform?

4015
04:39:48,480 --> 04:39:50,520
Maybe it's somewhere here.

4016
04:39:56,390 --> 04:39:56,870
Maybe.

4017
04:39:57,670 --> 04:39:59,430
Maybe I'm missing something here.

4018
04:40:03,520 --> 04:40:07,080
Okay, but I want the money too I

4019
04:40:11,040 --> 04:40:12,060

Nothing here.

4022
04:40:44,670 --> 04:40:45,510
Oh my god.

4023
04:40:45,830 --> 04:40:48,750
How do I lower the last box?

4024
04:40:53,860 --> 04:40:56,080
How do I lower you?

4025
04:40:57,140 --> 04:40:58,720

4027
04:41:06,780 --> 04:41:09,080

4029
04:41:14,580 --> 04:41:15,260

This one?

4031
04:41:18,180 --> 04:41:22,120
I swear to God, if that's not true, I swear to God.

4032
04:41:25,240 --> 04:41:26,420
Okay, there's one.

4033
04:41:27,920 --> 04:41:29,440
And then there's the other one.

4034
04:41:33,240 --> 04:41:34,000
Oh my God.

4035
04:41:37,100 --> 04:41:39,640
Oh my God, that's all I needed.

4036
04:41:40,320 --> 04:41:42,700
I, oh my God.

4037
04:41:43,280 --> 04:41:44,780
That's all I needed.

4038
04:41:44,780 --> 04:41:45,700

4039
04:41:51,770 --> 04:41:55,070

Yeah, I got blue, so it's okay.

4043
04:43:36,970 --> 04:43:38,210
I didn't want to risk it.

4044
04:43:38,310 --> 04:43:40,170
I didn't want to risk killing the robots.

4045
04:43:41,210 --> 04:43:42,270
Because, like, they were...

4046
04:43:42,270 --> 04:43:44,350
It was not their fault that they're evil.

4047
04:43:44,850 --> 04:43:45,210
You know?

4048
04:43:45,430 --> 04:43:46,610
They were made that way.

4049
04:43:47,350 --> 04:43:50,510
Maybe leaving, but you earned this because of what you did for Madam Leona.

4050
04:43:51,510 --> 04:43:51,810
Yay!

4051
04:43:52,090 --> 04:43:53,030

Okay, they were kicking around.

4055
04:44:28,770 --> 04:44:29,070
Poor Donald.

4056
04:44:29,630 --> 04:44:31,310

Okay, I got his body parts.

04:44:35,830 --> 04:44:37,690
Alright, everything is looking good.

4060
04:44:39,090 --> 04:44:39,870
Don't worry, Donald.

That's well!

4064
04:44:47,830 --> 04:44:50,890
I don't know how people do the fucking Donald voice.

4065
04:44:53,250 --> 04:44:55,930
I don't know what the fuck they do with their throat.

4066
04:45:00,900 --> 04:45:02,900
Aw, get some things never change.

4067
04:45:03,160 --> 04:45:03,440
Uh-huh.

4068
04:45:05,280 --> 04:45:05,600
Yay!

4069
04:45:07,120 --> 04:45:10,700
Right before I left Aashtown, my tugboat sank in the lake!

4070
04:45:11,120 --> 04:45:14,200
I mean, you should be able to get the thinner pumped up, but he'll need this gear.

4071
04:45:14,600 --> 04:45:15,620
Take the gear to Moody.

4072
04:45:15,820 --> 04:45:16,820
He knows what to do.

4073
04:45:16,900 --> 04:45:18,280
Who the fuck is Moody?

4074
04:45:21,980 --> 04:45:23,540
Okay, it must be like...

4075
04:45:23,600 --> 04:45:24,880
one of the gremlins.

4076
04:45:25,620 --> 04:45:27,540
Because I'm like, who the fuck is that guy?

4077
04:45:28,340 --> 04:45:28,660
Okay.

4078
04:45:29,260 --> 04:45:32,480
Okay, I gotta go back to the other place.

4079
04:45:32,640 --> 04:45:33,960
Okay, no, that's the veteran.

4080
04:45:34,700 --> 04:45:35,580
Oh, I'll go back.

4081
04:45:36,020 --> 04:45:38,060
Oh, hey, there's my... There's a painting over there.

4082
04:45:38,580 --> 04:45:41,440
Wait, I never grabbed the painting when I stole her face?

4083
04:45:44,600 --> 04:45:45,040
Alright.

4084
04:45:46,420 --> 04:45:46,860
Nice.

4085
04:45:49,200 --> 04:45:49,960
Look at that.

4086
04:45:50,080 --> 04:45:52,120
See, look at all the good stuff I've done.

4087
04:45:52,680 --> 04:45:54,400
I've matched up I'm not good.

4088
04:45:56,060 --> 04:45:57,640
Wait, where's the...

4089
04:45:57,640 --> 04:45:59,240
Where the fuck is the projector?

4090
04:45:59,360 --> 04:46:00,180
Oh, it's over there.

4091
04:46:00,600 --> 04:46:02,300
I was like, where is the projector?

4092
04:46:05,440 --> 04:46:06,340
Is this one?

4093
04:46:07,280 --> 04:46:08,420
God, it's so far.

4094
04:46:08,840 --> 04:46:11,420
Why isn't there, like, a projector in the town?

4095
04:46:11,540 --> 04:46:13,040
Like, that's much more convenient.

4096
04:46:14,420 --> 04:46:16,520
Why do I have to travel all the way here?

4097
04:46:17,140 --> 04:46:18,340
Wait, what's she doing here?

4098
04:46:19,780 --> 04:46:21,720
Hey, what are you doing next to the boat?

4099
04:46:23,860 --> 04:46:24,440
Hello?

4100
04:46:24,900 --> 04:46:25,300
Ma'am?

4101
04:46:25,680 --> 04:46:26,720
What are you doing here?

4102
04:46:27,740 --> 04:46:31,180
Has before... Oh my god, it's the fucking race woman.

4103
04:46:32,340 --> 04:46:33,260
God, get help.

4104
04:46:36,860 --> 04:46:38,380
Please get out.

4105
04:46:40,200 --> 04:46:41,760
Yes, I like to skip these.

4106
04:46:47,230 --> 04:46:49,610
Not everything is about racing, guys.

4107
04:46:52,750 --> 04:46:56,090
If I talk to Oswald, it progresses, so... Oh, fuck.

4108
04:46:56,990 --> 04:46:58,250
force to talk to him.

4109
04:46:58,730 --> 04:46:59,030
There you are.

4110
04:46:59,290 --> 04:47:02,230
The Shadow Bolt has marshaled all the botlings they could summon.

4111
04:47:02,590 --> 04:47:05,230
They're climbing up Mickey Junk Mountain to attack my fortress.

4112
04:47:06,010 --> 04:47:07,110
They're trying to...

4113
04:47:07,110 --> 04:47:08,370
Well, never mind what they're trying to do.

4114
04:47:08,470 --> 04:47:09,310
I need your help.

4115
04:47:09,590 --> 04:47:11,990
They gotta be repelled before I can help you launch the rocket.

4116
04:47:12,470 --> 04:47:13,430
Take all you can carry.

4117
04:47:13,750 --> 04:47:18,730
If those guys loyal to the Bolter up there, it's gonna be tough even for someone as great as you.

4118
04:47:19,030 --> 04:47:19,330
Alright.

4119
04:47:19,770 --> 04:47:20,990
I gotta...

4120
04:47:21,910 --> 04:47:23,130
Oswald needs help.

4121
04:47:23,410 --> 04:47:24,410
Okay, where am I?

4122
04:47:24,610 --> 04:47:24,950
Quest?

4123
04:47:26,110 --> 04:47:26,590
Uh...

4124
04:47:26,990 --> 04:47:28,210
Give the murder weapon.

4125
04:47:29,950 --> 04:47:30,970
Wait, actually.

4126
04:47:32,170 --> 04:47:34,010
Let's give him the films first.

4127
04:47:35,890 --> 04:47:36,070
Yay!

4128
04:47:36,270 --> 04:47:37,430
Oh, I got a new costume!

4129
04:47:38,830 --> 04:47:40,630
I'm a construction worker!

4130
04:47:42,690 --> 04:47:42,950
Wait.

4131
04:47:43,890 --> 04:47:44,530
Look at me go.

4132
04:47:44,570 --> 04:47:45,190
I have a hat.

4133
04:47:45,730 --> 04:47:47,310
That's when you know I'm certified.

4134
04:47:51,970 --> 04:47:52,370
Okay.

4135
04:47:53,650 --> 04:47:55,150
I got an extra TV sketch.

4136
04:47:56,610 --> 04:47:58,890
How many fucking achievements do I have?

4137
04:47:58,970 --> 04:47:59,430
Oh my god.

4138
04:47:59,510 --> 04:48:00,970
It's not paying attention.

4139
04:48:04,700 --> 04:48:05,160
Oh, God!

4140
04:48:05,460 --> 04:48:06,480
I'm a firefighter.

4141
04:48:06,560 --> 04:48:07,200
I'm certified.

4142
04:48:08,100 --> 04:48:08,820
That's all you need.

4143
04:48:08,920 --> 04:48:09,580
You just need a hat.

4144
04:48:10,360 --> 04:48:12,720
I didn't realize I could have got a...

4145
04:48:12,720 --> 04:48:15,380
I'm at the last level, and now I have...

4146
04:48:15,380 --> 04:48:16,340
Oh, my God.

4147
04:48:16,500 --> 04:48:18,020
Now I got all the rewards.

4148
04:48:18,360 --> 04:48:18,800
There we go.

4149
04:48:19,600 --> 04:48:20,600
That's all you need.

4150
04:48:21,180 --> 04:48:22,220
You just need a hat.

4151
04:48:22,520 --> 04:48:23,600
And then you're certified.

4152
04:48:25,460 --> 04:48:27,280
That's what Team Fortress 2 taught me.

4153
04:48:28,500 --> 04:48:29,200
Ooh, it's sealed.

4154
04:48:29,280 --> 04:48:30,400
Tiki Mask and why?

4155
04:48:32,220 --> 04:48:35,820
Candle and Bog, it walked away from Louie's shack out in the swamp.

4156
04:48:36,240 --> 04:48:37,100
I knew you could find it.

4157
04:48:37,280 --> 04:48:38,940
I do it, but I hear their ghost stare.

4158
04:48:39,080 --> 04:48:40,780
Poke around and see if you could find some clues.

4159
04:48:41,100 --> 04:48:42,140
Are you serious?

4160
04:48:42,460 --> 04:48:44,540
I just came from Bog.

4161
04:48:46,800 --> 04:48:51,500
I'm going to prove I'll shout it out that Constance, this will be a relief to not just Moody, but everyone in the park.

4162
04:48:51,920 --> 04:48:53,060
It's all thanks to you.

4163
04:48:53,740 --> 04:48:56,980
My business is start booming any day now, and maybe Pete will...

4164
04:48:56,980 --> 04:48:57,960
Oh, your business.

4165
04:48:58,080 --> 04:49:01,340
Yes, you totally did all the hard work, Horace.

4166
04:49:04,780 --> 04:49:05,460
Everything?

4167
04:49:07,080 --> 04:49:07,420
Okay.

4168
04:49:10,780 --> 04:49:12,540
Uh, fine, I'm missing Canada.

4169
04:49:14,620 --> 04:49:16,060
Wait, what were the failed quest?

4170
04:49:17,260 --> 04:49:18,160
Oh, shit.

4171
04:49:20,600 --> 04:49:21,920
That's fine.

4172
04:49:24,000 --> 04:49:26,140
We don't need...

4173
04:49:26,140 --> 04:49:27,360
He doesn't need a read.

4174
04:49:28,300 --> 04:49:29,300
That's fine.

4175
04:49:29,540 --> 04:49:30,800
He didn't need a read anyway.

4176
04:49:33,380 --> 04:49:36,220
Okay, let's give the film to Pete real quick.

4177
04:49:36,860 --> 04:49:37,560
Big bad Pete.

4178
04:49:41,060 --> 04:49:43,660
Okay, we're not gonna send the children to jail.

4179
04:49:44,540 --> 04:49:46,960
I'll be an even better leader after I watch this.

4180
04:49:47,180 --> 04:49:47,980
This is priceless.

4181
04:49:48,480 --> 04:49:51,500
Good thing for me, didn't recognize the true value of these cartoons.

4182
04:49:52,040 --> 04:49:55,940
I'll give you these e-tickets and a Pirate Spark, but I got the best end of this deal.

4183
04:49:56,580 --> 04:49:57,360
Is that everything?

4184
04:49:59,920 --> 04:50:00,400
Um...

4185
04:50:02,220 --> 04:50:05,640
I'll fix Donna's boat and then we'll call it here.

4186
04:50:06,040 --> 04:50:06,620
We'll not call it.

4187
04:50:06,720 --> 04:50:08,760
We'll go to Mickey Junk Mountain.

4188
04:50:10,860 --> 04:50:11,140
All right.

4189
04:50:11,940 --> 04:50:13,820
We can't arrest children, Pete.

4190
04:50:14,980 --> 04:50:18,920
There's a reason why they go to Juvee instead of jail for murder.

4191
04:50:21,080 --> 04:50:22,000
This way.

4192
04:50:22,500 --> 04:50:23,800
Let's fix his boat.

4193
04:50:30,370 --> 04:50:30,830
All right.

4194
04:50:31,910 --> 04:50:33,270
Wait for them to turn 18.

4195
04:50:33,410 --> 04:50:35,050
Then you can arrest the children.

4196
04:50:35,410 --> 04:50:37,510
Because they won't be children no more.

4197
04:50:38,930 --> 04:50:40,670
It's a long waiting game.

4198
04:50:43,010 --> 04:50:43,150
Alright.

4199
04:50:43,530 --> 04:50:44,670
This has to be Moody, right?

4200
04:50:45,850 --> 04:50:47,550
Who the fuck is Moody?

4201
04:50:50,430 --> 04:50:51,890
Oh, is it him?

4202
04:50:53,330 --> 04:50:53,810
Oh!

4203
04:50:54,110 --> 04:50:55,310
Okay, yeah, there we go.

4204
04:50:56,230 --> 04:51:00,290
I'm sorry, I assumed the fucking guy that was gonna fix it was the Gremlin and not the pirate.

4205
04:51:01,890 --> 04:51:04,230
I'll try to spy with Captain Hook while it's confined.

4206
04:51:05,870 --> 04:51:06,670
I did it.

4207
04:51:06,830 --> 04:51:07,570
I fixed the boat.

4208
04:51:11,050 --> 04:51:11,930
it should...

4209
04:51:11,930 --> 04:51:18,410
I mean, like, obviously when you're saying, like, someone's gonna fix the boat, you assume it's the Gremlins, because that's all they were doing.

4210
04:51:18,770 --> 04:51:19,850
They were the fixers.

4211
04:51:21,570 --> 04:51:22,530
He's a pirate.

4212
04:51:22,590 --> 04:51:23,870
A pirate doesn't fix.

4213
04:51:24,950 --> 04:51:25,850
A pirate seals.

4214
04:51:28,190 --> 04:51:28,630
No.

4215
04:51:28,850 --> 04:51:29,150
No.

4216
04:51:29,330 --> 04:51:29,610
No.

4217
04:51:29,770 --> 04:51:30,330
Get me out.

4218
04:51:31,010 --> 04:51:32,450
Did I not give him $10?

4219
04:51:32,670 --> 04:51:33,290
Get me out of here.

4220
04:51:34,950 --> 04:51:35,390
Okay.

4221
04:51:35,410 --> 04:51:35,770
Please.

4222
04:51:36,490 --> 04:51:37,350
I'll give you $10.

4223
04:51:44,670 --> 04:51:45,870
Okay, there you go.

4224
04:51:46,570 --> 04:51:47,090
Yes.

4225
04:51:47,910 --> 04:51:48,530
Here's $10.

4226
04:51:55,180 --> 04:51:55,480
Alright.

4227
04:52:00,400 --> 04:52:01,820
Where's Mickey Junk Mountain?

4228
04:52:02,500 --> 04:52:03,880
Wait, this is Mickey Junk Mountain.

4229
04:52:04,440 --> 04:52:05,040
Oh my god.

4230
04:52:05,460 --> 04:52:05,980
I...

4231
04:52:08,960 --> 04:52:10,060
I was going there.

4232
04:52:10,080 --> 04:52:10,780
Okay, I'm gonna pee.

4233
04:52:13,140 --> 04:52:14,460
That was Mickey.

4234
04:52:14,480 --> 04:52:17,420

4236
04:53:49,740 --> 04:53:51,940
the humor of a 13-year-old boy.

4237
04:53:55,860 --> 04:53:58,180
Do we need to stop?

4238
04:54:00,540 --> 04:54:01,300
Come on, fellas!

4239
04:54:07,700 --> 04:54:08,260
Huh?

4240
04:54:10,160 --> 04:54:10,720
Alright.

4241
04:54:11,700 --> 04:54:12,900
Off we go.

4242
04:54:13,740 --> 04:54:14,780
Wait, is there...

4243
04:54:14,780 --> 04:54:15,540
What I have to do?

4244
04:54:15,660 --> 04:54:16,480
Okay, fire...

4245
04:54:16,480 --> 04:54:16,760
Okay.

4246
04:54:17,780 --> 04:54:18,720
Oh, wait.

4247
04:54:24,520 --> 04:54:27,320
I think I was supposed to talk to Oswald, right?

4248
04:54:27,520 --> 04:54:28,900
No, Oswald would meet me there.

4249
04:54:30,680 --> 04:54:33,000
It's not going to climb itself, boys.

4250
04:54:39,690 --> 04:54:40,830
Someone's going to do it.

4251
04:54:47,390 --> 04:54:47,870
Yeah.

4252
04:54:51,310 --> 04:54:51,790
Jesus.

4253
04:54:55,010 --> 04:54:55,690
Oh, shit.

4254
04:54:55,970 --> 04:54:57,290
Can that thing run me over?

4255
04:54:57,730 --> 04:54:58,570
Let's try.

4256
04:55:00,950 --> 04:55:03,370
I'm asking the real questions here.

4257
04:55:05,810 --> 04:55:08,290
Your battle will be legendary.

4258
04:55:12,170 --> 04:55:12,810
Wee.

4259
04:55:15,810 --> 04:55:17,150
Oh my god.

4260
04:55:17,530 --> 04:55:17,850
Oh my.

4261
04:55:17,950 --> 04:55:20,990
This has to be the fucking slowest train.

4262
04:55:23,410 --> 04:55:23,810
Oh my god.

4263
04:55:23,890 --> 04:55:24,830

4264
04:55:25,410 --> 04:55:26,110
Wait, am I dead?

4265
04:55:26,230 --> 04:55:27,350
Oh, I got squashed.

4266
04:55:30,930 --> 04:55:31,330
Jesus.

4267
04:55:31,350 --> 04:55:32,950
This race is so slow.

4268
04:55:37,790 --> 04:55:38,350

4269
04:55:38,810 --> 04:55:41,570

4275
04:56:01,860 --> 04:56:03,140

4276
04:56:04,440 --> 04:56:05,100

4277
04:56:07,300 --> 04:56:07,880

04:56:10,320 --> 04:56:11,580

4307
04:58:14,660 --> 04:58:15,620

04:59:53,370 --> 04:59:53,930
Friend!

4340
04:59:57,370 --> 04:59:59,730

4352
05:01:42,370 --> 05:01:44,490
I'm so childish.

4353
05:01:53,780 --> 05:01:56,100
Toki, you are not sorry.

4354
05:01:57,740 --> 05:01:59,100
Guys, I'm sorry.

4355
05:02:04,360 --> 05:02:06,440
Oh, shit, my heart.

4356
05:02:13,370 --> 05:02:13,530

05:02:13,910 --> 05:02:14,410
Oh, shit.

4358
05:02:14,670 --> 05:02:15,230
That's not good.

4359
05:02:15,970 --> 05:02:16,370
No!

4360
05:02:17,270 --> 05:02:18,690
No, I wasn't picked!

4361
05:02:23,340 --> 05:02:24,800
Okay, that's deserved.

4362
05:02:25,220 --> 05:02:25,960
That's deserved.

4363
05:02:26,240 --> 05:02:28,100
That's honestly, I deserve it.

4364
05:02:28,200 --> 05:02:29,160
I deserve it.

4365
05:02:32,440 --> 05:02:34,040
I deserve it.

4366
05:02:34,180 --> 05:02:34,780
I do.

4367
05:02:38,460 --> 05:02:41,180
I can't believe I did do it from the start.

4368
05:02:41,460 --> 05:02:42,220
Are you serious?

4369
05:02:43,220 --> 05:02:43,640
Bro.

4370
05:02:46,060 --> 05:02:47,480
It was my bad.

4371
05:02:51,310 --> 05:02:53,200
It was my bad.

4372
05:02:53,620 --> 05:02:54,800
I actually threw...

4373
05:02:54,800 --> 05:02:56,920
I'm pretty sure I was like one hit too.

4374
05:02:58,220 --> 05:03:00,340
I literally was walking into all of them.

4375
05:03:04,690 --> 05:03:06,190
I deserve it.

4376
05:03:06,610 --> 05:03:07,310
God.

4377
05:03:08,570 --> 05:03:11,170
That's being too... That's being too childish.

4378
05:03:11,770 --> 05:03:12,650
I'm sorry.

4379
05:03:18,090 --> 05:03:19,550
They know I've sinned.

4380
05:03:22,770 --> 05:03:24,790
I wonder, like, if this affects it.

4381
05:03:25,490 --> 05:03:27,410
Or do I just dodge it until he...

4382
05:03:27,970 --> 05:03:31,310
Until he wants to, like, you know...

4383
05:03:31,310 --> 05:03:33,790
Until he wants to, like, fly.

4384
05:03:34,930 --> 05:03:35,690
I can't tell.

4385
05:03:40,220 --> 05:03:40,780
Okay.

4386
05:03:41,020 --> 05:03:42,120
I gotta...

4387
05:03:42,120 --> 05:03:43,300
Get that guy out of the way.

4388
05:03:43,320 --> 05:03:43,700
way.

4389
05:03:44,360 --> 05:03:44,360
Ow!

4390
05:03:44,520 --> 05:03:45,840
How did that hurt me?

4391
05:03:50,170 --> 05:03:50,570
Oh.

4392
05:03:53,010 --> 05:03:54,030
That's five.

4393
05:03:55,010 --> 05:03:55,830
That's five.

4394
05:03:56,570 --> 05:03:57,590
You'll land soon.

4395
05:03:58,790 --> 05:04:00,730
You'll have to land soon, guys.

4396
05:04:01,910 --> 05:04:02,870
There you go.

4397
05:04:03,690 --> 05:04:05,770
And then I...

4398
05:04:05,770 --> 05:04:06,690
Come on.

4399
05:04:06,850 --> 05:04:07,490
Suck it.

4400
05:04:08,490 --> 05:04:09,310
That's right.

4401
05:04:09,470 --> 05:04:10,810
Into the mouth it goes.

4402
05:04:11,190 --> 05:04:11,590
My friendship.

4403
05:04:12,730 --> 05:04:13,470
Okay, I'll stop.

4404
05:04:13,750 --> 05:04:14,170
I'll stop.

4405
05:04:22,010 --> 05:04:25,630
That's when you know he and I We're best friends

4406
05:04:31,610 --> 05:04:46,590
She won't stop She lies Toki, you said you'd stop Okay, okay, now I stop They make it so easy.

05:04:47,210 --> 05:04:49,190
Like, look at this.

4408
05:04:51,490 --> 05:04:53,010
It's not my fault.

4409
05:04:53,650 --> 05:04:56,290
They're like walking into it.

4410
05:04:57,390 --> 05:04:58,710
They set it up for me.

4411
05:04:58,810 --> 05:04:59,990
How is this my fault?

4412
05:05:00,870 --> 05:05:02,790
It's perfectly set up.

4413
05:05:04,530 --> 05:05:05,970
I put set up.

4414
05:05:10,210 --> 05:05:11,750
Oh my god, they're all dead.

4415
05:05:12,430 --> 05:05:13,730
All my friends are dead.

4416
05:05:15,370 --> 05:05:17,530
You need help, don't you?

4417
05:05:17,590 --> 05:05:20,570

Now they're best friends.

4421
05:05:28,130 --> 05:05:28,510
That's right.

4422
05:05:28,570 --> 05:05:29,270
I'm a fireman.

4423
05:05:29,430 --> 05:05:31,270
I'm just using my hose, guys.

4424
05:05:33,950 --> 05:05:37,270
I'm just doing my job, guys.

4425
05:05:37,450 --> 05:05:39,290
I'm just doing my job.

4426
05:05:41,030 --> 05:05:44,530
And I'm spraying my hose into his mouth.

4427
05:05:45,490 --> 05:05:46,370
Look, he's choking.

4428
05:05:52,170 --> 05:05:54,690

Yes!

4435
05:06:12,110 --> 05:06:13,810
He enjoyed it.

4436
05:06:14,630 --> 05:06:15,390
Look at that.

4437
05:06:16,150 --> 05:06:16,850
Oh my god.

05:06:16,950 --> 05:06:17,570
Now we're together.

4439
05:06:17,590 --> 05:06:18,990
Feet down.

05:06:21,390 --> 05:06:22,610
See, I told you!

4442
05:06:22,910 --> 05:06:24,010
He liked it.

4443
05:06:24,690 --> 05:06:27,270
And that's how you become friends.

4444
05:06:27,570 --> 05:06:28,370
Yeah, cuddling.

4445
05:06:32,210 --> 05:06:34,870
Remember to cuddle after.

4446
05:06:36,150 --> 05:06:37,410
Look at that.

4447
05:06:37,810 --> 05:06:38,610
And a boo.

4448
05:06:40,270 --> 05:06:40,830
And a boo.

4449
05:06:41,730 --> 05:06:42,290
Help.

4450
05:06:49,250 --> 05:06:51,050
See, now we're best friends.

4451
05:06:53,830 --> 05:06:55,650
Thanks, that was a close one.

4452
05:06:57,910 --> 05:06:59,050
No one else has made it.

4453
05:06:59,090 --> 05:06:59,770
What's in it?

4454
05:07:00,130 --> 05:07:00,750
The bolt.

4455
05:07:01,830 --> 05:07:01,970
What?

4456
05:07:02,270 --> 05:07:03,490
But I've been fighting the bolt.

4457
05:07:04,610 --> 05:07:06,450
You haven't seen the real bolt.

4458
05:07:07,150 --> 05:07:08,290
A long time back.

4459
05:07:08,830 --> 05:07:11,090
You saved Waste and I lost Ortenzia.

4460
05:07:12,650 --> 05:07:15,890
I stay here on the mountain to guard the jug.

4461
05:07:16,670 --> 05:07:18,610
The guys you fought are just trippings.

4462
05:07:19,390 --> 05:07:21,230
Oh, I didn't mention that before.

4463
05:07:22,290 --> 05:07:24,230
important to mention.

4464
05:07:27,150 --> 05:07:28,390
Mickey Mouse!

4465
05:07:29,310 --> 05:07:32,850
We want me to start over and shake on proof!

4466
05:07:33,230 --> 05:07:36,230
He just murdered it!

4467
05:07:38,790 --> 05:07:41,810
A while ago, I found this workshop.

4468
05:07:42,450 --> 05:07:43,930
A pair of paint and thinner.

4469
05:07:44,270 --> 05:07:45,490
Things got out of control.

4470
05:07:46,050 --> 05:07:48,430
I spilled the jug onto the gateway to this place.

4471
05:07:48,970 --> 05:07:50,650
I caused the thinner disaster.

4472
05:07:52,350 --> 05:07:53,030
You!

4473
05:07:53,450 --> 05:07:54,930
I'm really sorry.

4474
05:07:55,130 --> 05:07:55,510
Uh-huh.

4475
05:07:56,830 --> 05:08:00,430
I should have known you stole my life and ruined my home?

4476
05:08:01,110 --> 05:08:02,230
That's it.

4477
05:08:04,690 --> 05:08:05,910
You and me, Mouse.

4478
05:08:06,310 --> 05:08:07,930
Right now, point him up.

4479
05:08:09,290 --> 05:08:11,850
I've been waiting this for years.

4480
05:08:12,990 --> 05:08:15,390
This is finally gonna be my moment.

4481
05:08:17,330 --> 05:08:18,010
Wait.

4482
05:08:18,530 --> 05:08:19,830
Did I get the bad ending?

4483
05:08:20,870 --> 05:08:21,290
Wait.

4484
05:08:21,870 --> 05:08:22,210
Wait.

4485
05:08:27,080 --> 05:08:29,180
Oswald No

4486
05:08:35,470 --> 05:08:48,870
No I did so much No Wait no this is not over right No

4487
05:08:52,210 --> 05:09:05,610
It might not be over It's not over It's not over guys I still have time I still have time I still have time to use my friendship beam one last time.

4488
05:09:08,910 --> 05:09:09,310
Wait, what?

4489
05:09:09,910 --> 05:09:12,070
Oh, oh, it's because I'm like his dad.

4490
05:09:12,290 --> 05:09:12,850
Oh, my God.

4491
05:09:13,130 --> 05:09:14,230
They choked him to death.

4492
05:09:15,310 --> 05:09:17,050
He's like, dad, dad.

4493
05:09:21,990 --> 05:09:22,970
My heart.

4494
05:09:26,090 --> 05:09:26,270
Oh.

4495
05:09:27,450 --> 05:09:28,450
My heart.

4496
05:09:32,020 --> 05:09:33,160
Where's Oswald?

4497
05:09:34,420 --> 05:09:34,720
Oswald?

4498
05:09:35,680 --> 05:09:38,100
I bet you're sorry you had to save me.

4499
05:09:38,280 --> 05:09:40,380
That's why they call me the Lucky Rabbit.

4500
05:09:42,360 --> 05:09:44,560
It's even bigger than I remember.

4501
05:09:45,420 --> 05:09:46,160
Oh no.

4502
05:09:46,660 --> 05:09:47,540
Oh no.

4503
05:09:48,180 --> 05:09:49,960
What are those?

4504
05:09:51,020 --> 05:09:54,620
Those bloodicles will absorb all the pain in the wasteland.

4505
05:09:56,440 --> 05:09:58,160
Looks like it's up to us, Gus.

4506
05:10:00,540 --> 05:10:02,420
Let's get to Haustown.

4507
05:10:06,140 --> 05:10:07,780
Oh my god, it's not over yet.

4508
05:10:08,100 --> 05:10:09,420
There's still hope, guys.

4509
05:10:10,920 --> 05:10:12,700
It's endgame time.

4510
05:10:13,660 --> 05:10:14,680
Oh no!

4511
05:10:16,220 --> 05:10:17,640
Everything is gone!

4512
05:10:19,680 --> 05:10:22,200
Haustown is overrun by bloodicles.

4513
05:10:22,580 --> 05:10:23,280
They're everywhere.

4514
05:10:24,520 --> 05:10:25,040
It's okay.

4515
05:10:26,440 --> 05:10:27,580
I have my heart.

4516
05:10:29,320 --> 05:11:01,820
and then we get this out one out of four with the power of friendship and the keyblade i will have my heart back it's okay my long hose will save the world i'm a firefighter guys pass the test jokey i don't think you're licensed to be a the more you talk the more More I feel like you're not licensed to be a firefighter.

4517
05:11:04,460 --> 05:11:05,960
Of course I am.

4518
05:11:06,040 --> 05:11:07,220
Don't you see my hat?

4519
05:11:08,500 --> 05:11:10,180
Guys, look, I have a hat.

4520
05:11:13,240 --> 05:11:15,660
Oh my god, he beat him up.

4521
05:11:18,580 --> 05:11:19,360
Okay, nice.

4522
05:11:20,360 --> 05:11:21,320
What is he just doing?

4523
05:11:22,720 --> 05:11:26,160
Oh my god, people are like fucking dying and he's just...

4524
05:11:28,160 --> 05:11:30,080
Let's get rid of the tentacles, though.

4525
05:11:30,800 --> 05:11:33,360
Let's pop the tentacle pimples.

4526
05:11:35,640 --> 05:11:39,480
And that is last tentacle right here.

4527
05:11:40,300 --> 05:11:42,360
I'm a certified firefighter.

4528
05:11:46,470 --> 05:11:52,230
I'm, like, worried to use, like, the green stuff because it's a...

4529
05:11:52,230 --> 05:11:53,770
It's the bad.

4530
05:11:54,510 --> 05:11:55,810
It's the bad paint.

4531
05:11:57,730 --> 05:12:01,050
It looks like we cleared out the bloodicles from Maw's town.

4532
05:12:01,510 --> 05:12:01,510
Yay!

4533
05:12:08,540 --> 05:12:09,300
Okay, I did.

4534
05:12:09,380 --> 05:12:09,880
Oh my god.

4535
05:12:10,380 --> 05:12:11,120
They came back.

4536
05:12:13,440 --> 05:12:14,220
Oh my god.

4537
05:12:14,360 --> 05:12:15,060
They came back.

4538
05:12:15,300 --> 05:12:16,060
It's a miracle.

4539
05:12:17,220 --> 05:12:19,140
Okay, we gotta go back to the town now.

4540
05:12:19,640 --> 05:12:23,100
I want to get rid of the green attack, but I can't.

4541
05:12:23,740 --> 05:12:24,500
I did it!

4542
05:12:24,540 --> 05:12:25,540
I got more HP!

4543
05:12:25,980 --> 05:12:26,340
Nice!

4544
05:12:28,340 --> 05:12:28,780
Okay.

4545
05:12:29,100 --> 05:12:30,480
Let's go back to Mean Street.

4546
05:12:30,780 --> 05:13:07,810
Oh, I still have to- I'm here to save the world and you're still gonna make me pay ten dollars they're like you want to save the you want to save my world ten dollars please i'm literally doing this for free like i'm this is literally charity work for me i still have to pay that man i'm starting to see why he liked you more focus deadly peril remember he has daddy issues us will definitely has daddy issues you know folks here would die for a heart and you gave up Remling just meant?

4547
05:13:08,670 --> 05:13:09,870
You'd have done the same.

4548
05:13:10,090 --> 05:13:10,170
Huh?

4549
05:13:11,670 --> 05:13:14,030
Maybe for my whole new bunch, Oh, Tensia.

4550
05:13:14,730 --> 05:13:15,330
But you?

4551
05:13:15,690 --> 05:13:17,770
Now you're stuck here like me.

4552
05:13:19,130 --> 05:13:22,210
Now Donald Duck can finally be the main character.

4553
05:13:24,030 --> 05:13:25,270
The rocket is useless.

4554
05:13:25,690 --> 05:13:27,470
No one can get out of here without the heart.

4555
05:13:28,550 --> 05:13:28,990
No one?

4556
05:13:31,130 --> 05:13:32,850
Well, it's not important now.

4557
05:13:33,050 --> 05:13:33,830
We've lost.

4558
05:13:34,830 --> 05:13:35,430
That's over.

4559
05:13:36,230 --> 05:13:38,110
God will destroy everything.

4560
05:13:41,770 --> 05:13:42,610
We're just giving up.

4561
05:13:42,770 --> 05:13:43,330
We've had a fight.

4562
05:13:43,650 --> 05:13:43,790
Uh-huh.

4563
05:13:44,610 --> 05:13:45,390
Fight what?

4564
05:13:45,490 --> 05:13:46,150
That storm?

4565
05:13:46,490 --> 05:13:48,010
We can't even reach it.

4566
05:13:48,230 --> 05:13:52,390
The true ending, Donald Duck, finally gets to be the main character.

4567
05:13:53,730 --> 05:13:55,190
Bring the fight to the blood.

4568
05:13:57,050 --> 05:13:58,630
That won't defeat the blood.

4569
05:13:58,830 --> 05:14:00,590
It can't regain its strength.

4570
05:14:02,530 --> 05:14:04,610
These bloodicles feed it all.

4571
05:14:04,770 --> 05:14:05,750
The penguin means.

4572
05:14:06,230 --> 05:14:07,470
I'll take care of the bloodicles.

4573
05:14:07,690 --> 05:14:08,830
You fix the rocket.

4574
05:14:09,250 --> 05:14:09,610
Uh-huh.

4575
05:14:10,670 --> 05:14:12,350
But could we really...

4576
05:14:12,350 --> 05:14:13,670
Sure, give me the parts.

4577
05:14:14,010 --> 05:14:15,890
Then meet me in the rocket in Tomorrow City.

4578
05:14:21,290 --> 05:14:23,090
Now I really do see why.

4579
05:14:23,710 --> 05:14:24,130
Oh, wait.

4580
05:14:24,590 --> 05:14:25,490
Okay, I have to take...

4581
05:14:25,490 --> 05:14:26,350
I have to help them.

4582
05:14:26,590 --> 05:14:27,790
Don't worry, guys!

4583
05:14:28,850 --> 05:14:29,530
Pop pop!

4584
05:14:30,750 --> 05:14:31,890
Click pop pop!

4585
05:14:33,050 --> 05:14:35,450
Okay, we gotta turn him into Algoor.

4586
05:14:36,290 --> 05:14:38,290
Turn him into Algoor, too.

4587
05:14:39,150 --> 05:14:39,710
Okay.

4588
05:14:39,730 --> 05:14:42,970
I want to use the bad move right now.

4589
05:14:43,410 --> 05:14:45,170
So, oh, I can't go.

4590
05:14:45,990 --> 05:14:47,310
I can't use it.

4591
05:14:47,450 --> 05:14:48,370
Okay, but what?

4592
05:14:48,750 --> 05:14:48,830
What?

4593
05:14:49,010 --> 05:14:49,690
It's one move.

4594
05:14:49,970 --> 05:14:50,990
One, one time.

4595
05:14:54,030 --> 05:14:55,150
It's one time.

4596
05:14:59,770 --> 05:15:01,310
It's just one guy.

4597
05:15:01,570 --> 05:15:02,610
It's just one guy.

4598
05:15:02,830 --> 05:15:03,810
It's just really that bad.

4599
05:15:04,050 --> 05:15:04,970
It's just one guy.

4600
05:15:06,430 --> 05:15:08,690
It's the Stokey of the Earth.

4601
05:15:09,730 --> 05:15:11,030
It's one guy.

4602
05:15:11,670 --> 05:15:12,850
Is it really that bad?

4603
05:15:12,990 --> 05:15:14,150
It's one guy.

4604
05:15:14,430 --> 05:15:15,290
It died.

4605
05:15:16,730 --> 05:15:18,150
Toki, it died.

4606
05:15:18,590 --> 05:15:21,610
What do you mean is it really that bad?

4607
05:15:22,850 --> 05:15:23,970
He's dead.

4608
05:15:30,040 --> 05:15:31,600
That's how it starts.

4609
05:15:32,140 --> 05:15:34,220
Then you want to keep doing it.

4610
05:15:35,300 --> 05:15:35,660
Don't worry.

4611
05:15:35,760 --> 05:15:36,020
No, no, no.

4612
05:15:36,020 --> 05:15:36,720
I resisted.

4613
05:15:36,800 --> 05:15:37,480
I resisted.

4614
05:15:37,640 --> 05:15:38,520
It's just one time.

4615
05:15:39,380 --> 05:15:40,680
It's just one time.

4616
05:15:40,800 --> 05:15:41,820
I resisted.

4617
05:15:42,540 --> 05:15:44,200
Oh my god, he's a big boy!

4618
05:15:45,940 --> 05:15:47,220
Look at him go!

4619
05:15:47,580 --> 05:15:48,580
It's fine.

4620
05:15:50,660 --> 05:15:51,780
It might...

4621
05:15:51,780 --> 05:15:53,620
Okay, yeah, he's slowly turning blue.

4622
05:15:54,980 --> 05:15:56,680
He's slowly turning blue, it's working.

4623
05:15:57,220 --> 05:15:58,420
I just gotta feed him.

4624
05:16:00,360 --> 05:16:01,180
Okay, there we go.

4625
05:16:03,460 --> 05:16:03,940
Alright.

4626
05:16:05,120 --> 05:16:06,440
Let him keep sucking.

4627
05:16:07,520 --> 05:16:09,480
Give him the friendship juice.

4628
05:16:10,580 --> 05:16:11,780
See, look, he's slowly blue!

4629
05:16:14,620 --> 05:16:15,520
Okay, nice.

4630
05:16:15,840 --> 05:16:16,080
Yay!

4631
05:16:17,040 --> 05:16:18,640
We're all friends now.

4632
05:16:18,960 --> 05:16:19,260
Yay!

4633
05:16:19,460 --> 05:16:20,180
Look at him!

4634
05:16:20,740 --> 05:16:21,720
He's so happy!

4635
05:16:23,280 --> 05:16:24,880
Okay, we gotta get this.

4636
05:16:25,760 --> 05:16:26,760
Wait, is he not friend?

4637
05:16:27,620 --> 05:16:28,360
No, he is.

4638
05:16:28,440 --> 05:16:30,540
He was just collateral damage.

4639
05:16:35,700 --> 05:16:36,240
Yay!

4640
05:16:37,140 --> 05:16:39,120
Okay, I need to have HP, though.

4641
05:16:41,240 --> 05:16:41,740
Should be...

4642
05:16:41,740 --> 05:16:42,520
Oh, one more pimple.

4643
05:16:42,540 --> 05:16:42,820

4644
05:16:44,240 --> 05:16:45,120
Pocked it!

4645
05:16:46,440 --> 05:16:47,740
This is all your fault, Doki.

4646
05:16:47,880 --> 05:16:48,260
That's it.

4647
05:16:48,380 --> 05:16:50,060
You're out of the Mickey Mouse Club.

4648
05:16:50,460 --> 05:16:50,740
Same.

4649
05:16:50,860 --> 05:16:51,740
Thank you for the super chat.

4650
05:16:51,820 --> 05:16:52,020
Thank you.

4651
05:16:52,280 --> 05:16:52,900
Thank you.

4652
05:16:52,900 --> 05:16:53,100
Thank you.

05:16:53,100 --> 05:16:55,120

Oh, okay.

4656
05:16:57,240 --> 05:17:00,520
We have to make sure everybody is okay.

4657
05:17:01,240 --> 05:17:02,420

4667
05:17:56,670 --> 05:17:56,890
Okay.

4668
05:17:59,350 --> 05:18:00,090

I have to do parkour for this.

4673
05:18:06,890 --> 05:18:07,870
That's fucked up.

4674
05:18:09,950 --> 05:18:12,130

Oh, you poor thing.

4678
05:18:50,530 --> 05:18:51,690
You have to parkour.

4679
05:18:52,470 --> 05:18:53,210
So sad.

4680
05:18:56,050 --> 05:18:56,450
Alright.

4681
05:18:57,250 --> 05:18:58,110
We did it.

4682
05:18:58,130 --> 05:18:59,010
We saved him.

4683
05:18:59,970 --> 05:19:00,970
We saved Sam.

4684
05:19:01,410 --> 05:19:02,690
Wait, is he good or bad?

4685
05:19:02,790 --> 05:19:04,410
Yeah, he's good.

4686
05:19:05,110 --> 05:19:07,250
You can't tell him if they're good or bad.

4687
05:19:07,350 --> 05:19:08,550
Because they're just the same.

4688
05:19:08,670 --> 05:19:09,550
They're still purple.

4689
05:19:10,210 --> 05:19:10,790
Oh my god.

4690
05:19:10,910 --> 05:19:12,030
They're all like...

4691
05:19:12,030 --> 05:19:13,830
They're all ganged up on this poor man.

4692
05:19:15,290 --> 05:19:16,350
Okay, one.

4693
05:19:18,150 --> 05:19:19,230
Wait, are they fighting someone?

4694
05:19:19,350 --> 05:19:19,890
No, they're not.

4695
05:19:21,030 --> 05:19:22,470
What the fuck is that sound?

4696
05:19:23,930 --> 05:19:26,250
There's something, like, behind this tentacle.

4697
05:19:30,010 --> 05:19:30,550
Alright.

4698
05:19:31,630 --> 05:19:32,310
There we go.

4699
05:19:32,670 --> 05:19:33,630
Almost done.

4700
05:19:35,490 --> 05:19:36,890
But the last...

4701
05:19:36,890 --> 05:19:38,810
Oh my god, it's not almost done.

4702
05:19:38,850 --> 05:19:40,330
I forgot the parkour section.

4703
05:19:40,930 --> 05:19:41,630
There's more.

4704
05:19:42,250 --> 05:19:43,490
We have to go higher.

4705
05:19:44,590 --> 05:19:47,710
I'll go as high as we've never gotten before.

4706
05:19:48,970 --> 05:19:49,880
Alright, there we go.

4707
05:19:53,670 --> 05:19:54,730
Great job, Mickey.

4708
05:19:54,990 --> 05:19:56,670
But there are more Flotacos to fight.

4709
05:19:56,750 --> 05:19:57,970
Let's head to Bog Easy.

4710
05:19:58,170 --> 05:20:00,530
Okay, Bog Easy and then the Spacetown.

4711
05:20:00,950 --> 05:20:02,050
And then we should be good.

4712
05:20:03,450 --> 05:20:05,350
Alright, time to pay my taxes.

4713
05:20:06,690 --> 05:20:08,770
To save your fucking world.

4714
05:20:11,790 --> 05:20:13,570
No, I don't need to repaint everything.

05:20:13,910 --> 05:20:16,790

4720
05:20:52,000 --> 05:20:53,380
They were little silly hats.

4721
05:20:54,780 --> 05:20:56,560
Look at them and their little silly hats.

4722
05:20:58,300 --> 05:20:59,340
Oh my god.

4723
05:20:59,600 --> 05:21:00,400
They're new.

4724
05:21:02,400 --> 05:21:02,880
Alright.

4725
05:21:03,920 --> 05:21:05,380
Just gotta paint this guy.

4726
05:21:05,920 --> 05:21:07,080
Wait, I thought we're friends!

4727
05:21:07,260 --> 05:21:08,040
What the fuck?

4728
05:21:09,500 --> 05:21:10,680
Oh, now we're...

4729
05:21:10,680 --> 05:21:11,660
Okay, I didn't realize.

4730
05:21:12,980 --> 05:21:14,300
Okay, now we're friends.

4731
05:21:15,900 --> 05:21:16,620
Alright, there we go.

4732
05:21:19,900 --> 05:21:20,940
Is it all painted?

4733
05:21:21,440 --> 05:21:21,580
Oh.

4734
05:21:22,320 --> 05:21:23,820
Oh, it's all the way over there.

4735
05:21:25,180 --> 05:21:25,940
Oh my god.

4736
05:21:26,040 --> 05:21:27,600
How far do these tentacles go?

4737
05:21:30,520 --> 05:21:32,180
Okay, and then paint this guy.

4738
05:21:35,460 --> 05:21:35,900
Holy shit.

4739
05:21:35,960 --> 05:21:37,640
How far does this tentacle go?

4740
05:21:37,780 --> 05:21:38,520
It's everywhere.

4741
05:21:40,680 --> 05:21:42,580
Freaking little maze I'm doing.

4742
05:21:45,400 --> 05:21:45,800
Okay.

4743
05:21:49,810 --> 05:21:51,610
It's gonna do a thank god.

4744
05:21:51,950 --> 05:21:57,550
Thank god my brush goes really far Why can't they help me?

4745
05:21:58,810 --> 05:22:04,030
Like their whole thing is that they paint and they don't even help me paint That's fucked up.

4746
05:22:04,110 --> 05:22:08,250
What's the point of being your friend if you don't help me out buddy?

4747
05:22:13,050 --> 05:22:13,730
Be blue.

4748
05:22:15,030 --> 05:22:20,050
All right They're also doing the bare minimum

4749
05:22:23,390 --> 05:22:25,650
You're just doing what you're doing, Doki.

4750
05:22:25,810 --> 05:22:27,090
They learn from the best.

4751
05:22:27,850 --> 05:22:28,470
Oh, shit.

4752
05:22:28,730 --> 05:22:29,410
Oh, shit.

4753
05:22:29,630 --> 05:22:29,930
You're evil.

4754
05:22:30,050 --> 05:22:30,530
You're all evil.

4755
05:22:30,750 --> 05:22:31,890
I didn't realize you're all evil.

4756
05:22:32,370 --> 05:22:33,610
You all look blue.

4757
05:22:37,970 --> 05:22:39,970
I didn't know they're evil.

4758
05:22:41,190 --> 05:22:42,510
They already looked.

4759
05:22:43,070 --> 05:22:44,070
I-what?

4760
05:22:45,230 --> 05:22:45,950
That's fine.

4761
05:22:46,330 --> 05:22:46,790
That's fine.

4762
05:22:48,090 --> 05:22:48,330
It's okay.

4763
05:22:48,410 --> 05:22:49,470
I didn't do it.

4764
05:22:49,530 --> 05:22:50,930
I didn't cause his death.

4765
05:22:51,090 --> 05:22:51,870
He did it himself.

4766
05:22:52,770 --> 05:22:54,170
I didn't do it.

4767
05:22:59,830 --> 05:23:00,370
That's fine.

4768
05:23:01,490 --> 05:23:03,250
He caused his own death, guys.

4769
05:23:03,410 --> 05:23:04,330
It wasn't my fault.

4770
05:23:05,690 --> 05:23:07,270
Oh my god.

4771
05:23:13,110 --> 05:23:13,830
Okay, nice.

4772
05:23:16,010 --> 05:23:17,250
They did it to themselves.

4773
05:23:20,330 --> 05:23:22,230
Yeah, I need to grab health, though.

4774
05:23:22,530 --> 05:23:23,570
Yeah, I knew that was health.

4775
05:23:24,690 --> 05:23:24,970
Okay.

4776
05:23:26,350 --> 05:23:26,910
Nice.

4778
05:24:02,230 --> 05:24:03,610
Toki, stop a minute.

4779
05:24:03,870 --> 05:24:05,370
Please talk to your lawyer.

4780
05:24:13,760 --> 05:24:14,280
Yay!

4781
05:24:18,590 --> 05:24:19,530
Okay, we did it.

4782
05:24:19,590 --> 05:24:20,970
We gotta go back to Mean Street.

4783
05:24:25,530 --> 05:24:26,050
Alright.

4784
05:24:30,040 --> 05:24:32,240
Yeah, I assisted and he didn't die.

4785
05:24:32,740 --> 05:24:33,960
That's less of a hard...

4786
05:24:33,960 --> 05:24:35,540
That's like a lesser sense.

4787
05:24:36,200 --> 05:24:37,580
sentence if he lives.

4788
05:24:39,580 --> 05:24:41,760
You know why he's angry at this time?

4789
05:24:42,100 --> 05:24:42,280
Huh?

4790
05:24:42,940 --> 05:24:44,720
That's the voodoo doll?

4791
05:24:45,540 --> 05:24:47,020
That's the mystery who made it.

4792
05:24:47,360 --> 05:24:49,780
Someone sold a doll before I could break the curse.

4793
05:24:50,280 --> 05:24:52,540
They must be using it to annoy Donald.

4794
05:24:52,960 --> 05:24:55,160
Why would anybody make a voodoo doll?

4795
05:24:55,520 --> 05:24:56,040
Donald?

4796
05:24:56,740 --> 05:24:58,100
Oh, never mind.

4797
05:24:58,940 --> 05:24:59,700
Why the fuck?

4798
05:25:00,200 --> 05:25:03,160
I got broken all the pieces and then those lousy ghosts show up here?

4799
05:25:03,240 --> 05:25:04,380
What's the big idea?

4800
05:25:04,720 --> 05:25:08,560
After you That, you go running away, not precious to show up.

4801
05:25:08,760 --> 05:25:10,580
Then right after that, I got back to get it.

4802
05:25:10,680 --> 05:25:12,120
What happens that splatter?

4803
05:25:13,440 --> 05:25:17,740
Ever since that stupid looking getting got here, I'm a serious pain.

4804
05:25:18,180 --> 05:25:19,600
I'm not kidding, Mickey.

4805
05:25:20,560 --> 05:25:22,800
You'll find out why that splatter is here, Mickey.

4806
05:25:23,380 --> 05:25:24,760
I owe you one.

4807
05:25:25,860 --> 05:25:26,120
What?

4808
05:25:28,820 --> 05:25:31,560
Bro, I need to save the world, Donald.

4809
05:25:32,080 --> 05:25:32,560
Why?

4810
05:25:36,160 --> 05:25:37,520
I restore them for me.

4811
05:25:37,760 --> 05:25:38,800
Just come back when they're all...

4812
05:25:38,800 --> 05:25:40,560
Bro, I need to save the world!

4813
05:25:43,000 --> 05:25:43,800
I did?

4814
05:25:44,180 --> 05:25:45,020
Oh, I did it!

4815
05:25:45,100 --> 05:25:47,440
I want to have this power spark and pin as a...

4816
05:25:47,440 --> 05:25:49,440
Like, I don't fucking know.

4817
05:25:50,960 --> 05:25:51,920
I don't...

4818
05:25:51,920 --> 05:25:52,600
What?

4819
05:25:52,980 --> 05:25:55,360
How the fuck do I save you?

4820
05:25:57,140 --> 05:25:58,840
Lies in the swamp.

4821
05:26:01,040 --> 05:26:01,960
Back there?

4822
05:26:02,480 --> 05:26:04,300
You have to go to...

4823
05:26:04,300 --> 05:26:05,720
A veteran?

4824
05:26:06,820 --> 05:26:08,660
What did that veteran do?

4825
05:26:13,430 --> 05:26:14,450
Look, the dog!

4826
05:26:16,290 --> 05:26:16,970
Oh, shit!

4827
05:26:18,690 --> 05:26:19,770
Oh, that's fucked up.

4828
05:26:20,250 --> 05:26:20,950
Oh, my god.

4829
05:26:21,290 --> 05:26:21,290
Hey.

4830
05:26:21,670 --> 05:26:22,010
Head.

4831
05:26:22,850 --> 05:26:23,590
Oh, shit!

4832
05:26:27,190 --> 05:26:27,850
Boar?

4833
05:26:34,030 --> 05:26:35,310
Was that just...

4834
05:26:35,310 --> 05:26:36,370
Did he just got bored?

4835
05:26:37,430 --> 05:26:38,930
I wonder who we should return.

4836
05:26:38,950 --> 05:26:39,530
turn it to.

4837
05:26:39,650 --> 05:26:40,550
I guess to Donald.

4838
05:26:41,850 --> 05:26:43,170
Wait, how did he...

4839
05:26:43,170 --> 05:26:44,390
Did he poop that out?

4840
05:26:44,790 --> 05:26:45,770
Tookie, please.

4841
05:26:50,230 --> 05:26:50,590
Alright.

4842
05:26:51,050 --> 05:26:51,790
Hello, Donald.

4843
05:26:54,370 --> 05:26:55,530
It doesn't even look like me.

4844
05:26:55,790 --> 05:26:58,270
I hope you gave that spatter what it had coming.

4845
05:26:58,910 --> 05:27:00,870
When is something even worse, gets it.

4846
05:27:01,230 --> 05:27:01,710
I know.

4847
05:27:02,050 --> 05:27:03,970
Can you find somebody who likes me to keep it safe?

4848
05:27:04,270 --> 05:27:05,010
Don't say it.

4849
05:27:05,230 --> 05:27:06,590
Lots of folks like me.

4850
05:27:06,830 --> 05:27:08,710
I probably shouldn't keep it myself.

4851
05:27:08,950 --> 05:27:09,730
Oh, okay.

4852
05:27:09,850 --> 05:27:10,870
I'll just give it to Daisy.

4853
05:27:12,030 --> 05:27:12,790
Daisy likes you.

4854
05:27:14,590 --> 05:27:15,230
Alright.

4855
05:27:16,710 --> 05:27:17,950
I'll find Daisy.

4856
05:27:18,570 --> 05:27:19,130
Okay, it's this way.

4857
05:27:21,470 --> 05:27:23,990
Okay, like, he literally ate the duck.

4858
05:27:24,530 --> 05:27:24,950
Like...

4859
05:27:24,950 --> 05:27:27,830
It was right there.

4860
05:27:29,450 --> 05:27:31,290
Okay, we gotta...

4861
05:27:32,210 --> 05:27:34,050
We gotta give this to Daisy.

4862
05:27:34,930 --> 05:27:36,990
I'm pretty sure Daisy likes him.

4863
05:27:37,490 --> 05:27:38,010
Right?

4864
05:27:38,190 --> 05:27:38,430
Right?

4865
05:27:42,940 --> 05:27:44,300
Yeah, it has to be.

4866
05:27:44,400 --> 05:27:45,260
That's his girlfriend.

4867
05:27:49,490 --> 05:27:51,030
Surely, okay, I don't know.

4868
05:27:51,170 --> 05:27:55,390
Maybe it's a bad idea to give, like, a dog that...

4869
05:27:55,390 --> 05:27:56,250
Actually, no.

4870
05:27:56,550 --> 05:27:58,370
That's actually a really bad idea.

4871
05:28:00,830 --> 05:28:05,030
You do not want to give a voodoo dog to your significant other.

4872
05:28:05,490 --> 05:28:08,230
Because, like, you know, what if you piss them off?

4873
05:28:10,150 --> 05:28:11,710
That's too much power.

4874
05:28:11,790 --> 05:28:13,090
Now that I think about it.

4875
05:28:13,230 --> 05:28:16,190
That may or may not be too much at power.

4876
05:28:16,490 --> 05:28:17,370
Let's give...

4877
05:28:21,290 --> 05:28:23,550
That seems an incredibly...

4878
05:28:23,550 --> 05:28:27,290
That seems like it'll lead to an incredibly toxic relationship.

4879
05:28:27,910 --> 05:28:29,830
Anyway, let's give the doll to Daisy.

4880
05:28:33,870 --> 05:28:35,110
Wait, no, Daisy doesn't live here.

4881
05:28:35,290 --> 05:28:36,590
Daisy lives in...

4882
05:28:38,970 --> 05:28:39,490
Uh...

4883
05:28:39,490 --> 05:28:41,230
Daisy lives in the Tikiuro.

4884
05:28:42,130 --> 05:28:42,750
This is where...

4885
05:28:42,750 --> 05:28:43,390
Wait, goofy!

4886
05:28:44,150 --> 05:28:44,570
Goofy!

4887
05:28:44,590 --> 05:28:46,130
can take care of the dog.

4888
05:28:48,150 --> 05:28:50,510
He's too ignorant to do anything bad with it.

4889
05:28:53,630 --> 05:28:54,610
Oh, he doesn't care.

4890
05:28:54,990 --> 05:28:55,970
He's... Never mind.

4891
05:28:56,290 --> 05:28:56,890
He's...

4892
05:28:56,890 --> 05:28:57,650
He's too ignorant.

4893
05:28:58,370 --> 05:29:00,550
He's so ignorant that he doesn't care.

4894
05:29:01,950 --> 05:29:03,050
Yeah, he's responsible.

4895
05:29:03,230 --> 05:29:04,630
He has a teenage son.

4896
05:29:05,610 --> 05:29:06,310
That's crazy.

4897
05:29:06,450 --> 05:29:07,310
Pete and...

4898
05:29:07,310 --> 05:29:09,590
Pete and Goofy are the only two characters.

4899
05:29:11,030 --> 05:29:11,630
That...

4900
05:29:11,630 --> 05:29:12,890
That bangs.

4901
05:29:15,410 --> 05:29:17,290
You think about it.

4902
05:29:26,150 --> 05:29:26,310
Alright.

4903
05:29:27,310 --> 05:29:29,370
Yeah, Pete and Goofy both have sons.

4904
05:29:32,570 --> 05:29:34,170
He yucks, guys.

4905
05:29:34,530 --> 05:29:35,550
They both yucks.

4906
05:29:39,150 --> 05:29:43,110
Okay, but Pete's wife is kind of a patty.

4907
05:29:44,410 --> 05:29:46,010
I don't know what...

4908
05:29:46,010 --> 05:29:48,710
I don't even know what Pete's wife looks like.

4909
05:29:48,710 --> 05:29:50,690
I don't even remember what Pete's wife looks like.

4910
05:29:52,030 --> 05:29:52,950
Is this a doll?

4911
05:29:53,130 --> 05:29:53,650
How cute.

4912
05:29:53,850 --> 05:29:55,470
It looks just like Donald.

4913
05:29:56,630 --> 05:29:57,670
May I keep it, please?

4914
05:29:57,870 --> 05:29:59,990
I promise to take very good care of it.

4915
05:30:00,170 --> 05:30:00,310
Wait.

4916
05:30:02,090 --> 05:30:04,790
Is it a good ending if I give it to Daisy?

4917
05:30:06,070 --> 05:30:08,750
Will she actually take really good care of it?

4918
05:30:10,390 --> 05:30:17,870
Guys, is this a bad or also what the fuck is going on with the cow slam dunking into that thing?

4919
05:30:20,390 --> 05:30:20,910
Yes.

4920
05:30:21,550 --> 05:30:21,650
Yes.

4921
05:30:23,010 --> 05:30:26,570
I mean, like, who else do I give it to?

4922
05:30:26,690 --> 05:30:28,670
Why is this a yes or no question?

4923
05:30:29,590 --> 05:30:32,330
Was there someone else I could have given it to?

4924
05:30:37,710 --> 05:30:41,570
Who else would have taken the fucking voodoo dog?

4925
05:30:42,630 --> 05:30:44,710
Why is it a yes or no?

4926
05:30:47,910 --> 05:30:50,070
Um, I trust my heart.

4927
05:30:52,030 --> 05:31:05,050

4928
05:31:14,390 --> 05:31:26,830

4929
05:31:32,750 --> 05:31:39,090
Oh no Yeah, I give it to her Why Pete?

4930
05:31:39,690 --> 05:31:41,610
Why is Pete in this equation?

4931
05:31:42,270 --> 05:31:48,550
Yeah Like who the fuck thinks like I'm gonna give it to Pete When you get the doll?

4932
05:31:48,870 --> 05:31:51,550
Like why is he even in the equation?

4933
05:31:53,510 --> 05:31:54,010
Yeah, right?

4934
05:31:54,170 --> 05:31:54,430
Pete?

4935
05:31:54,710 --> 05:31:56,590
Like where did he come from?

4936
05:31:59,350 --> 05:32:26,790
first just to be mean because he is a bad option yeah bad guy Pete he love you Pete will treat him right guys I just want to make sure that I don't have to talk to him or anything I was gonna see if I have to talk to Donald I guess so that you can get the pure evil route I watched the ending of the evil route just Because,

4937
05:32:26,850 --> 05:32:27,790
like, I got curious.

4938
05:32:28,230 --> 05:32:31,350
Because, obviously, like, it's something I can't have.

4939
05:32:32,030 --> 05:32:34,110
And, like, evil Mickey is actually crazy.

4940
05:32:34,210 --> 05:32:36,210
He literally just kills everyone in this world.

4941
05:32:36,690 --> 05:32:42,490
Like, because you have to do a lot of evil things to act.

4942
05:32:42,550 --> 05:32:46,370
Like, you have to purposely do every evil thing you can to get the evil ending.

4943
05:32:48,270 --> 05:32:48,750
Okay.

4944
05:32:49,110 --> 05:32:50,150
Why are you so angry?

4945
05:32:50,290 --> 05:32:51,910
I saved your fucking life.

4946
05:32:52,930 --> 05:32:56,530
And, like, basically, he literally kills everyone.

4947
05:32:56,610 --> 05:33:07,950
this world and he's like he and he enjoyed it this is what you're preventing me from doing

4948
05:33:11,650 --> 05:33:26,960
that could have been me guys all right it's too late we're already committed to the good route it's like the genocide route in undertale but instead of But it's Disney characters.

4949
05:33:36,380 --> 05:33:37,480
Joki watching the evil...

4950
05:33:37,480 --> 05:33:40,540
Yeah, I live vicariously through other people doing evil deeds.

4951
05:33:43,940 --> 05:33:44,360
Okay.

4952
05:33:46,280 --> 05:33:46,920
Watching the evil...

4953
05:33:46,920 --> 05:33:48,480
Like me watching food videos on that.

4954
05:33:48,560 --> 05:33:49,260
Oh, shit, nice.

4955
05:33:49,400 --> 05:33:50,780
No more logicals.

4956
05:33:53,560 --> 05:33:54,000
Yeah.

4957
05:33:55,200 --> 05:33:56,700
I'm done here.

4958
05:33:58,320 --> 05:33:59,100
You want to travel?

4959
05:33:59,320 --> 05:33:59,760
Yes.

4960
05:34:00,680 --> 05:34:01,460
It's time.

4961
05:34:01,880 --> 05:34:03,540
Tomorrow, city time.

4962
05:34:08,490 --> 05:34:10,370
It's time to go to Pluto.

4963
05:34:10,570 --> 05:34:11,710
Oh, it's the...

4964
05:34:11,710 --> 05:34:13,490
It's the cat.

4965
05:34:15,030 --> 05:34:16,640
God above this cat.

4966
05:34:21,030 --> 05:34:21,810
Hello,

4967
05:34:26,230 --> 05:34:26,650
cat.

4968
05:34:29,870 --> 05:34:30,650
No.

4969
05:34:31,330 --> 05:34:34,090
No, this is Pluto's dream.

4970
05:34:34,250 --> 05:34:34,730
That's not...

4971
05:34:34,730 --> 05:34:35,150
It's not...

4972
05:34:35,170 --> 05:34:37,530
This was Pluto's stream, guys.

4973
05:34:38,490 --> 05:34:39,210
It's not my...

4974
05:34:39,210 --> 05:34:40,410
It's not Mickey's stream.

4975
05:34:40,570 --> 05:34:41,650
It's Pluto's stream.

4976
05:34:42,070 --> 05:34:43,170
Remember that.

4977
05:34:45,130 --> 05:34:46,710
My freaky-ass dog.

4978
05:34:48,690 --> 05:34:51,110
This is my dog being a freak.

4979
05:34:55,770 --> 05:34:56,770
Oh, shit.

4980
05:34:56,870 --> 05:34:57,110
Ow.

4981
05:34:58,150 --> 05:34:58,890
That's fine.

4982
05:34:59,510 --> 05:35:01,130
I just need to get to the other side.

4983
05:35:06,430 --> 05:35:07,710
But, um...

4984
05:35:11,280 --> 05:35:12,660
Make me freak the owner.

4985
05:35:12,860 --> 05:35:14,220
What the fuck did I do?

4986
05:35:15,480 --> 05:35:17,620
Mickey, the bloodicles blocking space barrage.

4987
05:35:17,740 --> 05:35:18,680
Entrance need to go.

4988
05:35:18,980 --> 05:35:20,180
Okay, that's fine.

4989
05:35:23,440 --> 05:35:24,380
That's fine.

4990
05:35:24,660 --> 05:35:27,180
These guys don't pose any threats to me.

4991
05:35:31,460 --> 05:35:33,920
At best, we just get rid of...

4992
05:35:34,680 --> 05:35:36,540
Get rid of the blots, though.

4993
05:35:37,440 --> 05:35:38,780
The blots are the problem.

4994
05:35:40,720 --> 05:35:41,760
The blots are the problem.

4995
05:35:43,660 --> 05:35:44,220
Nice.

4996
05:35:46,460 --> 05:35:47,600
Alright, where's the other one?

4997
05:35:47,920 --> 05:35:48,760
Where does it start?

4998
05:35:49,220 --> 05:35:49,800
Oh, shit!

4999
05:35:50,100 --> 05:35:50,680
Don't worry.

5000
05:35:51,180 --> 05:35:52,060
Serpentine, ow.

5001
05:35:53,080 --> 05:35:53,900
That's not fair.

5002
05:35:56,300 --> 05:35:58,740
Me touching the pin hurts me?

5003
05:36:00,440 --> 05:36:01,680
Alright, let's grab this.

5004
05:36:04,020 --> 05:36:05,420
Oh my god, it's so far.

5005
05:36:06,180 --> 05:36:07,060
Fuck this.

5006
05:36:09,280 --> 05:36:10,360
Oh my god, fuck!

5007
05:36:10,460 --> 05:36:10,660
Okay.

5008
05:36:13,240 --> 05:36:16,060
These guys are so annoying, I have to get them out.

5009
05:36:17,320 --> 05:36:17,740
Alright.

5010
05:36:19,400 --> 05:36:20,260
Pop pop!

5011
05:36:21,520 --> 05:36:22,120
Pop pop!

5012
05:36:23,800 --> 05:36:24,080
Pop!

5013
05:36:26,580 --> 05:36:31,400
I think this part of the quest, this part of the level is so tedious.

5014
05:36:32,260 --> 05:36:32,500
Ow.

5015
05:36:32,980 --> 05:36:34,200
It's not cool, bro.

5016
05:36:35,220 --> 05:36:36,160
But that's not cool.

5017
05:36:37,480 --> 05:36:38,440
Bro, come on, bro.

5018
05:36:39,660 --> 05:36:40,800
It's not cool, buddy.

5019
05:36:42,400 --> 05:36:43,900
Where's the last tentacle?

5020
05:36:45,400 --> 05:36:46,040
Oh, it's over there.

5021
05:36:49,280 --> 05:36:49,780
Alright.

5022
05:36:52,060 --> 05:36:53,360
It's so tedious.

5023
05:36:54,280 --> 05:36:57,420
Because it's literally just walking around trying to find it.

5024
05:36:59,260 --> 05:37:01,580
And just spray the goop.

5025
05:37:04,760 --> 05:37:05,080
Yay!

5026
05:37:08,770 --> 05:37:09,670
Nice job!

5027
05:37:09,810 --> 05:37:10,370
Time to go!

5028
05:37:10,470 --> 05:37:11,490
Wait, we're here?

5029
05:37:12,270 --> 05:37:13,450
I assume it's over there, right?

5030
05:37:17,980 --> 05:37:21,640
Yeah, I feel like this part, they're definitely padding playtime for this part.

5031
05:37:26,150 --> 05:37:27,270
Alright, down I go.

5032
05:37:28,410 --> 05:37:30,530
So let me beat up the boss already.

5033
05:37:32,090 --> 05:37:33,370
Let me, let me add him.

5034
05:37:35,310 --> 05:37:37,330
Let me, let me force him to be my friend.

5035
05:37:38,590 --> 05:37:38,950
Yes.

5036
05:37:46,970 --> 05:37:47,370
Alright.

5037
05:37:49,290 --> 05:37:50,590
It's a boxing match, right?

5038
05:37:50,730 --> 05:37:52,910
Oh yeah, this is a robot boxing match.

5039
05:37:53,570 --> 05:37:59,230
Okay, I should be allowed to, like, fucking pay to skip for this.

5040
05:37:59,430 --> 05:38:01,130
Like, why are they making me do this again?

5041
05:38:08,890 --> 05:38:11,570
Oh my god, someone please save the monkey.

5042
05:38:11,850 --> 05:38:12,250
He's dead.

5043
05:38:15,750 --> 05:38:17,050
Oh my god, he's not even breathing.

5044
05:38:17,410 --> 05:38:18,610
Oh, he's not even blinking.

5045
05:38:19,090 --> 05:38:21,490
Oh my god, this is so fucked up.

5046
05:38:23,570 --> 05:38:24,670
that body anymore.

5047
05:38:26,490 --> 05:38:28,610
He's not even breathing anymore.

5048
05:38:33,970 --> 05:38:35,770
He's stopping on the dead monkey.

5049
05:38:42,780 --> 05:38:43,020
Alright.

5050
05:38:44,280 --> 05:38:45,800
It's the final countdown.

5051
05:38:48,180 --> 05:38:50,400
Looks like you have some bloodicles to take care of, Mickey.

5052
05:38:50,820 --> 05:38:52,880
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?

5053
05:38:53,140 --> 05:38:55,080
There's more bloodicles!

5054
05:38:57,660 --> 05:38:58,960
Oh my god.

5055
05:39:04,820 --> 05:39:06,820
Okay, where is...

5056
05:39:07,460 --> 05:39:08,820
It's okay, he can't climb stairs.

5057
05:39:10,640 --> 05:39:12,960
That's fucking right, I knew you can't reach me, bitch.

5058
05:39:18,010 --> 05:39:18,770
That's fine.

5059
05:39:18,910 --> 05:39:19,950
You're no threat to me.

5060
05:39:20,470 --> 05:39:21,630
Look at you, you're so slow.

5061
05:39:22,630 --> 05:39:23,610
Do I have this already?

5062
05:39:23,770 --> 05:39:24,210
Yeah, I do.

5063
05:39:24,430 --> 05:39:25,370
It's just money.

5064
05:39:30,880 --> 05:39:31,540
All right, Apako.

5065
05:39:36,350 --> 05:39:37,190
That's fine.

5066
05:39:39,070 --> 05:39:39,510
Nice.

5067
05:39:41,970 --> 05:39:44,310
Oh, two more to go!

5068
05:39:46,190 --> 05:39:47,370
It's over here.

5069
05:39:48,850 --> 05:39:50,150
It's so tedious!

5070
05:39:51,550 --> 05:39:52,290
Fuck this.

5071
05:39:56,860 --> 05:39:57,840
Alright, fight him.

5072
05:39:59,120 --> 05:40:00,200
Go beat him up.

5073
05:40:02,100 --> 05:40:03,540
Go beat him up, I don't care.

5074
05:40:05,680 --> 05:40:07,300
I'm doing the real job now.

5075
05:40:09,340 --> 05:40:11,880
As long as I'm not the one that's killing them, I should be fine.

5076
05:40:16,730 --> 05:40:17,710
Okay, nice.

5077
05:40:20,170 --> 05:40:20,690
Dave.

5078
05:40:22,950 --> 05:40:23,770
Is that the last one?

5079
05:40:23,930 --> 05:40:25,470
Oh, please tell me that's the last one.

5080
05:40:26,750 --> 05:40:27,110
Nice.

5081
05:40:27,410 --> 05:40:27,650
Alright.

5082
05:40:28,230 --> 05:40:28,690
One more.

5083
05:40:29,230 --> 05:40:30,390
Wait, good or bad?

5084
05:40:30,670 --> 05:40:30,970
Bad.

5085
05:40:31,890 --> 05:40:32,670
There you go.

5086
05:40:33,430 --> 05:40:34,290
Now you're good.

5087
05:40:36,230 --> 05:40:39,750
Someone, please, give this boticle a skincare routine.

5088
05:40:40,090 --> 05:40:41,330
This ain't healthy, buddy.

5089
05:40:43,750 --> 05:40:44,750
Oh, thank God.

5090
05:40:44,830 --> 05:40:45,550
It's not that bad.

5091
05:40:45,750 --> 05:40:48,050
Okay, that's It was just three blots.

5092
05:40:50,590 --> 05:40:51,390
Hello, Oswald.

5093
05:40:58,060 --> 05:40:59,080
All the bloticles are destroyed.

5094
05:40:59,340 --> 05:41:00,780
Now the rock is ready for liftoff.

5095
05:41:01,540 --> 05:41:02,640
Not too bad, Mickey.

5096
05:41:03,020 --> 05:41:04,660
I probably could have done it better.

5097
05:41:04,880 --> 05:41:06,060
But I was late.

5098
05:41:06,360 --> 05:41:07,860
Come on, let's blast off.

5099
05:41:09,120 --> 05:41:09,820
Up I go.

5100
05:41:12,200 --> 05:41:15,120
Bro, this bloticle actually has Nina's skincare routine.

5101
05:41:15,640 --> 05:41:17,000
That ain't healthy for the skin.

5102
05:41:18,240 --> 05:41:20,120
It's so moisturized.

5103
05:41:20,380 --> 05:41:21,220
It's too oily.

5104
05:41:22,980 --> 05:41:24,820
He's letting it all build up.

5105
05:41:26,100 --> 05:41:27,480
Did you forget to fill it up?

5106
05:41:38,110 --> 05:41:39,010
Oh my god.

5107
05:41:39,110 --> 05:41:40,890
How fucking big is this thing?

5108
05:41:42,950 --> 05:41:44,530
Alright, we head for the heart.

5109
05:41:45,250 --> 05:41:47,310
When we get close, we hit the self-destruct.

5110
05:41:48,230 --> 05:41:49,250
That's gonna hurt.

5111
05:41:49,350 --> 05:41:50,570
Just speaking personally.

5112
05:41:53,130 --> 05:41:53,930
Oh my god.

5113
05:41:54,310 --> 05:41:55,470
What the fuck is it?

5114
05:41:55,590 --> 05:41:56,770
Oh my god.

5115
05:41:57,430 --> 05:41:58,590
What is it?

5116
05:41:58,850 --> 05:42:00,650
Oh, it's absorbing the pants because it's...

5117
05:42:00,650 --> 05:42:02,950
I feel so uncomfortable by that.

5118
05:42:04,830 --> 05:42:06,390
It was kind of a budget issue.

5119
05:42:10,270 --> 05:42:11,050
It's okay.

5120
05:42:11,550 --> 05:42:12,530
We're at the head.

5121
05:42:14,930 --> 05:42:15,910
I'm losing her.

5122
05:42:16,570 --> 05:42:18,090
Wait, I think we can reach.

5123
05:42:20,670 --> 05:42:21,590
What happened?

5124
05:42:23,410 --> 05:42:24,270
Can we reach it?

5125
05:42:24,930 --> 05:42:26,110
That was quite a crash.

5126
05:42:26,650 --> 05:42:27,570
You've been out for a while.

5127
05:42:28,850 --> 05:42:31,270
got you to the control tower when you came through.

5128
05:42:31,810 --> 05:42:34,790
He also said something about launching a fireworks show before he hopped off.

5129
05:42:35,370 --> 05:42:38,510
He's out there distracting the bloc to buy his time to get up there.

5130
05:42:38,970 --> 05:42:41,670
Goodness, this is where you and I first met.

5131
05:42:42,090 --> 05:42:43,790
Looks like Flinner has flooded the place.

5132
05:42:44,170 --> 05:42:45,230
Think we can drain it?

5133
05:42:45,590 --> 05:42:46,570
How do we drain it?

5134
05:42:47,490 --> 05:42:48,710
Oh, we have to fix that.

5135
05:42:50,530 --> 05:42:50,970
Okay.

5136
05:42:52,010 --> 05:42:55,350
I gotta meet Oswald in the control tower, but we gotta fix this first.

5137
05:42:56,770 --> 05:42:58,830
Back where it all started, guys.

5138
05:43:00,170 --> 05:43:03,950
Oh, that's cool.

5139
05:43:04,150 --> 05:43:04,890
I didn't notice that.

5140
05:43:05,050 --> 05:43:07,750
There's like the... Oh, okay, no, that's... That's... He's my teammate.

5141
05:43:08,330 --> 05:43:09,690
Okay, he freaked me out, guys.

5142
05:43:09,810 --> 05:43:12,590
Guys, bro, you freaked... Bro, you don't... Don't do that, bro.

5143
05:43:12,710 --> 05:43:13,490
That's not cool.

5144
05:43:14,310 --> 05:43:15,330
It's so cool, though.

5145
05:43:15,350 --> 05:43:16,850
Look at... There's, like, the Disney villains.

5146
05:43:17,970 --> 05:43:19,330
But also, that's not cool, bro.

5147
05:43:20,550 --> 05:43:21,450
Don't freak out.

5148
05:43:21,590 --> 05:43:24,250
Don't... Don't just... Yeah, just do that to another bro, man.

5156
05:44:44,230 --> 05:44:44,530
Fuck it.

5157
05:44:47,210 --> 05:44:47,810
Uh.

5158
05:44:48,570 --> 05:44:50,170
Where is the next one?

5159
05:44:50,950 --> 05:44:52,570
I drained it already.

5160
05:44:52,970 --> 05:44:53,750
It's over there?

5161
05:44:55,690 --> 05:44:56,350
It's fine.

5162
05:44:56,390 --> 05:44:57,690
I'll take a little bit of damage.

5163
05:44:58,850 --> 05:44:59,890
So I can get across.

5164
05:45:01,470 --> 05:45:01,850
Huh?

5165
05:45:03,590 --> 05:45:04,490
Over here?

5166
05:45:04,590 --> 05:45:05,970
Maybe it's over here.

5167
05:45:09,450 --> 05:45:10,430
It's over here.

5168
05:45:10,530 --> 05:45:11,050
Oh, it is.

5169
05:45:12,350 --> 05:45:12,810
Nice.

5170
05:45:14,790 --> 05:45:15,830
One more to go.

5171
05:45:17,050 --> 05:45:18,090
Yay, free chest.

5172
05:45:21,970 --> 05:45:22,310
Yay!

5173
05:45:25,750 --> 05:45:26,310
Alright.

5174
05:45:28,410 --> 05:45:30,610
Grab some HP and some blotters.

5175
05:45:31,030 --> 05:45:31,530
Oh, what happens?

5176
05:45:31,690 --> 05:45:32,150
Oh, shit.

5177
05:45:32,370 --> 05:45:32,850
No, never mind.

5178
05:45:33,570 --> 05:45:36,030
What happens to me?

5179
05:45:36,050 --> 05:45:38,570
I paint Oswald, though.

5180
05:45:40,210 --> 05:45:40,850
And whatever.

5181
05:45:43,690 --> 05:45:44,590
It's just all that.

5182
05:45:45,670 --> 05:45:46,550
Oh, it's just that.

5183
05:45:46,690 --> 05:45:48,490
Okay, yeah, I'm not fucking painting you anymore.

5184
05:45:49,850 --> 05:45:51,230
I'm gonna grab this, though.

5185
05:45:53,550 --> 05:45:55,430
Paint them so I can beat it up.

5186
05:45:57,050 --> 05:45:58,190
That's your purpose.

5187
05:46:03,370 --> 05:46:04,590
There's still one more.

5188
05:46:05,270 --> 05:46:06,230
Oh, it's over here.

5189
05:46:09,050 --> 05:46:09,330
Ow.

5190
05:46:13,110 --> 05:46:14,370
They did it.

5191
05:46:14,370 --> 05:46:14,790
Five!

5192
05:46:15,010 --> 05:46:15,370
Yay!

5193
05:46:16,110 --> 05:46:17,990
Born just to be beat up.

5194
05:46:18,450 --> 05:46:19,410
Such is life.

5195
05:46:21,070 --> 05:46:21,430
Yay!

5196
05:46:22,070 --> 05:46:22,790
I did it.

5197
05:46:23,610 --> 05:46:24,550
Where did that come from?

5198
05:46:24,710 --> 05:46:26,830
He must be guarding that projector screen behind the door.

5199
05:46:27,670 --> 05:46:28,470
Oh, that's easy.

5200
05:46:29,330 --> 05:46:32,630
Wait, before I do that, let me grab this painting real fast.

5201
05:46:33,510 --> 05:46:34,590
An HP too.

5202
05:46:35,890 --> 05:46:36,530
And refill.

5203
05:46:36,650 --> 05:46:37,170
Reload!

5204
05:46:38,050 --> 05:46:39,030
I have to reload too.

5205
05:46:39,050 --> 05:46:41,750
There was a lot of things I had to do.

5206
05:46:42,690 --> 05:46:43,110
It's time.

5207
05:46:43,410 --> 05:46:44,070
Open your mouth.

5208
05:46:44,530 --> 05:46:45,190
Say aah.

5209
05:46:50,220 --> 05:46:51,970
Open your mouth.

5210
05:46:55,690 --> 05:46:56,970
It's time.

5211
05:46:59,390 --> 05:46:59,630
Alright.

5212
05:47:00,230 --> 05:47:00,870
Gotta wait.

5213
05:47:06,680 --> 05:47:06,840
Alright.

5214
05:47:07,320 --> 05:47:08,040
One more hit.

5215
05:47:09,240 --> 05:47:09,740
Oh, nice.

5216
05:47:10,580 --> 05:47:11,340
Just two.

5217
05:47:11,920 --> 05:47:12,240
Yay!

5218
05:47:16,620 --> 05:47:17,220
Refill.

5219
05:47:17,900 --> 05:47:18,080
Reload.

5220
05:47:19,500 --> 05:47:20,500
Oh, Sleeping Beauty.

5221
05:47:20,780 --> 05:47:21,600
What the fuck?

5222
05:47:24,600 --> 05:47:26,160
Wait, that's a movie.

5223
05:47:27,700 --> 05:47:31,780
Where the fuck did Sleeping Beauty get into my Mickey shorts?

5224
05:47:33,860 --> 05:47:35,500
We skipped Snow White?

5225
05:47:36,000 --> 05:47:36,420
Damn.

5226
05:47:39,120 --> 05:47:40,960
Doesn't matter if you were the first, I guess.

5227
05:47:41,060 --> 05:47:42,320
What the fuck, Maleficent?

5228
05:47:42,340 --> 05:48:16,820
it what the fuck are you doing here wait slipping beauty isn't a forgotten movie it's a fucking timeless classic what the fuck wait a minute what the fuck the sleeping beauty became a forgotten movie oh shit oh weird that it's here it's in the vault oh yeah they vaulted it

5229
05:48:20,200 --> 05:48:37,480
they vaulted it but you can you can buy it for the first time in in a hundred years it's you can now buy like the was it the diamond edition of sleeping beauty and just remember that when they unvaulted movies

5230
05:48:41,820 --> 05:48:52,280
well how do i get the v yeah they open the vault yeah how do i get that film though here oh it's here

5231
05:48:56,640 --> 05:48:58,040
they would do it

5232
05:49:03,250 --> 05:49:11,130
all the time they would make like what was it the gold edition the platinum edition and then the diamond edition.

5233
05:49:12,250 --> 05:49:13,910
And it worked every time.

5234
05:49:23,030 --> 05:49:28,110
Like, if anything, that should have been the Black Cauldron movie or level.

5235
05:49:28,450 --> 05:49:29,690
Not fucking Sleeping Beauty.

5236
05:49:29,990 --> 05:49:30,650
Like, what the fuck?

5237
05:49:31,110 --> 05:49:34,970
Um, Maleficent is in Sleeping Beauty is in Kingdom Hearts.

5238
05:49:36,710 --> 05:49:39,390
And Maleficent is one of the main enemies in there.

5239
05:49:39,710 --> 05:49:41,410
How is that a forgotten movie?

5240
05:49:42,010 --> 05:49:42,310
Yeah.

5241
05:49:43,550 --> 05:49:44,130
Hmm.

5242
05:49:46,640 --> 05:49:48,360
Look, gargoyles.

5243
05:49:49,460 --> 05:49:51,860
You can't turn them with your spin move.

5244
05:49:52,080 --> 05:49:52,860
Give it a try.

5245
05:49:53,140 --> 05:49:54,890
What do I do by spinning on them?

5246
05:49:57,720 --> 05:49:58,380
Oh.

5247
05:49:59,940 --> 05:50:00,580
Bean.

5248
05:50:07,310 --> 05:50:08,930
So waiting for Kingdom Hearts 4.

5249
05:50:10,010 --> 05:50:11,810
You'll just be disappointed.

5250
05:50:13,150 --> 05:50:14,610
Just like Kingdom Hearts 3.

5251
05:50:17,290 --> 05:50:18,770
Oh hey, there's his girlfriend.

5252
05:50:19,150 --> 05:50:19,530
Oh!

5253
05:50:20,770 --> 05:50:22,230
Happy and sad works.

5254
05:50:22,870 --> 05:50:25,730
Repairing all of one type can really change the character of the ha.

5255
05:50:26,230 --> 05:50:29,110
Sometimes physically, try restoring all of one set.

5256
05:50:30,010 --> 05:50:30,370
Aww.

5257
05:50:31,710 --> 05:50:33,410
Oh shit, not him again.

5258
05:50:41,870 --> 05:50:44,210
Just gotta go in with low expectations.

5259
05:50:46,270 --> 05:50:47,910
Don't be fucked up as Silk Sompi King.

5260
05:50:48,030 --> 05:50:49,570
Was it actually not as good?

5261
05:50:52,170 --> 05:50:54,690
This is why we don't get Half-Life 3.

5262
05:50:56,770 --> 05:51:24,410
it way too long and then people would be like and then and they don't want to disappoint people don't say that and I fucked up no after all this time don't chase it don't you know don't do this to us I pretty fucked up wouldn't it guys

5265
05:52:07,240 --> 05:52:08,780
I thought I was doing a good thing.

5266
05:52:08,880 --> 05:52:10,360
I thought I was being a hero.

5267
05:52:21,540 --> 05:52:22,140
What's over here?

5268
05:52:22,280 --> 05:52:23,320
Oh, hey, it's a watch.

5269
05:52:26,360 --> 05:52:27,480
Already have this.

5270
05:52:28,920 --> 05:52:32,240
As long as I don't accidentally hit this, it should be fine.

5271
05:52:34,840 --> 05:52:36,460
There goes my hero.

5272
05:52:37,220 --> 05:52:40,260
See, this is why you go in with zero expectations.

5273
05:52:40,480 --> 05:52:42,960
So you won't get disappointed, guys.

5274
05:52:45,320 --> 05:52:46,640
Wait, what's over here?

5275
05:52:47,780 --> 05:52:48,380
Oh, nothing.

5276
05:52:52,740 --> 05:52:55,180
I'll fill this up so it's like I didn't know.

5277
05:52:55,480 --> 05:52:56,980
It's like I didn't commit a crime.

5278
05:52:59,100 --> 05:53:00,260
There's a hole on the floor?

5279
05:53:00,540 --> 05:53:01,400
No, there's not.

5280
05:53:03,360 --> 05:53:04,320
No, there's not.

5281
05:53:04,420 --> 05:53:05,860
There's no holes on the floor.

5282
05:53:05,940 --> 05:53:06,740
They don't exist.

5283
05:53:09,260 --> 05:53:10,480
We gotta go here, though.

5284
05:53:14,520 --> 05:53:15,580
Okay, I just wanted to be sure

5285
05:53:19,510 --> 05:53:45,720

5287
05:54:22,880 --> 05:54:25,860
As long as I had the evidence, no one will know.

5288
05:54:26,580 --> 05:54:28,220
There's no hole on the floor.

5289
05:54:28,660 --> 05:54:29,860
Hey, so what do you mean?

5290
05:54:30,080 --> 05:54:31,120
There's no hole on the floor.

5291
05:54:32,020 --> 05:54:34,140
I have no idea what you guys are talking about.

5292
05:54:37,140 --> 05:54:38,540
Oh, this is a mirror.

5293
05:54:42,470 --> 05:54:45,690
Okay, I need to burst this real fast.

5294
05:54:46,930 --> 05:54:48,470
Wait, is there a bad painting in here?

5295
05:54:50,110 --> 05:54:50,510
Oh.

5296
05:54:51,310 --> 05:54:53,490
Wait, but what if there's... Okay, there's nothing good on this.

5297
05:54:53,510 --> 05:54:53,890
painting.

5298
05:54:55,010 --> 05:54:55,390
Oh, shit!

5299
05:54:55,530 --> 05:54:55,950
Oh, my god.

5300
05:54:56,090 --> 05:54:57,510
I didn't realize there was a bad man here.

5301
05:54:58,730 --> 05:54:59,050
Alright.

5302
05:55:03,630 --> 05:55:04,170
Okay.

5303
05:55:05,510 --> 05:55:08,850
I gotta make sure...

5304
05:55:08,850 --> 05:55:09,690
There we go.

5305
05:55:14,400 --> 05:55:14,940
Okay.

5306
05:55:15,180 --> 05:55:16,940
And then I gotta spin that guy.

5307
05:55:17,860 --> 05:55:19,180
And I'll spin him.

5308
05:55:19,740 --> 05:55:21,160
And he'll hit this.

5309
05:55:21,520 --> 05:55:22,300
Wait, what?

5310
05:55:25,960 --> 05:55:27,380
Wait, how would it...

5311
05:55:27,380 --> 05:55:27,860
Wait a minute.

5312
05:55:27,880 --> 05:55:28,240
minute.

5313
05:55:29,400 --> 05:55:29,660
Okay.

5314
05:55:30,440 --> 05:55:32,280
Let me figure this out.

5315
05:55:33,380 --> 05:55:33,820
Um.

5316
05:55:37,020 --> 05:55:37,820
Um.

5317
05:55:42,490 --> 05:55:43,550
Let me...

5318
05:55:43,550 --> 05:55:44,330
Okay.

5319
05:55:44,650 --> 05:55:48,210
And then he hits him over here.

5320
05:55:49,850 --> 05:55:50,670
What's over here?

5321
05:55:53,750 --> 05:55:54,550
Oh.

5322
05:55:56,070 --> 05:55:58,710
Have you thought about not being lonely, Oswald?

5323
05:55:59,170 --> 05:55:59,290
What?

5324
05:56:00,330 --> 05:56:04,670
Okay, and then we reflect this guy.

5325
05:56:10,510 --> 05:56:12,270
Where the fuck is he hitting that?

5326
05:56:15,770 --> 05:56:16,330
What?

5327
05:56:25,720 --> 05:56:26,760
Oh, there we go.

5328
05:56:26,880 --> 05:56:29,720
I was like, why is this not working?

5329
05:56:31,060 --> 05:56:31,820
Okay, and then...

5330
05:56:31,820 --> 05:56:32,120
Yay!

5331
05:56:36,040 --> 05:56:37,660
This is a good thing, right?

5332
05:56:37,980 --> 05:56:39,300
Yeah, it is, thank God.

5333
05:56:40,240 --> 05:56:41,400
I did it!

5334
05:56:41,580 --> 05:56:42,800
I saved the world!

5335
05:56:42,860 --> 05:56:46,240
Did I repair everything, though?

5336
05:56:47,420 --> 05:56:49,000
Are all the paintings repaired?

5337
05:56:53,990 --> 05:56:54,730
I don't know.

5338
05:56:56,290 --> 05:56:57,730
Painting done, painting.

5339
05:57:00,290 --> 05:57:00,930
Did I...

5340
05:57:01,630 --> 05:57:03,510
Did I fix everything?

5341
05:57:10,150 --> 05:57:11,830
I don't...

5342
05:57:11,830 --> 05:57:13,450
I don't know.

5343
05:57:14,690 --> 05:57:15,910
Are all the paintings fixed?

5344
05:57:16,050 --> 05:57:18,090
I can't do it!

5345
05:57:20,970 --> 05:57:22,070
Oh, I got the pin.

5346
05:57:22,170 --> 05:57:22,690
Yeah, I did.

5347
05:57:22,930 --> 05:57:23,350
I did.

5348
05:57:23,750 --> 05:57:24,270
Okay, nice.

5349
05:57:24,390 --> 05:57:25,350
I'm a hero.

5350
05:57:25,850 --> 05:57:26,290
Vantasia!

5351
05:57:30,610 --> 05:57:31,790
I like Vantasia.

5352
05:57:32,170 --> 05:57:35,110
I remember, um, I think it was, like, the second Vantasia?

5353
05:57:36,510 --> 05:57:42,130
Um, and my parents took me to watch it, like, at, like, a Disney World.

5354
05:57:42,330 --> 05:57:42,610
Oops.

5355
05:57:43,250 --> 05:57:43,950
Am I dead?

5356
05:57:47,710 --> 05:57:48,150
Okay.

5357
05:57:49,690 --> 05:57:50,110
How?

5358
05:57:52,250 --> 05:57:53,830
I don't understand.

5359
05:57:55,850 --> 05:57:58,430
Oh, okay, it just, I don't know, fuck me, I guess.

5360
05:57:58,550 --> 05:57:58,770
It didn't.

5361
05:58:01,270 --> 05:58:03,610
Oh, yeah, yeah, okay, there we go.

5362
05:58:04,010 --> 05:58:05,950
Okay, I hate, never mind, I hate Fantasia.

5363
05:58:06,650 --> 05:58:10,030
Never mind, never mind, fuck this level.

5364
05:58:11,070 --> 05:58:11,830
I, oh!

5365
05:58:20,150 --> 05:58:22,470
Never mind, this level fucking sucks.

5366
05:58:24,490 --> 05:58:25,770
Are you serious?

5367
05:58:26,090 --> 05:58:28,230
I timed... Oh my, fuck this.

5368
05:58:28,690 --> 05:58:29,750
Oh, I could have just done that.

5369
05:58:29,950 --> 05:58:31,410
I could have just done that.

5370
05:58:34,830 --> 05:58:35,310
Yeah.

5371
05:58:39,460 --> 05:58:40,860
Okay, now I know.

5372
05:58:44,140 --> 05:58:45,300
Okay, there's the film.

5373
05:58:46,060 --> 05:58:48,800
There's the... Wait, is there a film reel over here then?

5374
05:58:49,980 --> 05:58:50,900
Yes, there is.

5375
05:58:51,140 --> 05:58:51,620
Thank God.

5376
05:58:52,420 --> 05:58:53,420
I knew it.

5377
05:58:54,000 --> 05:58:56,120
I knew there was a film reel right here.

5378
05:58:59,870 --> 05:59:06,190
okay there has to be another film reel i'm oh my god are you fucking

5379
05:59:09,860 --> 05:59:17,780
okay now we know now we know the pattern

5380
05:59:21,550 --> 05:59:48,150
i i don't need that film reel i don't i don't need that film reel now that i thought okay but maybe okay but maybe maybe i can do it it's up there it's literally up there

5381
05:59:52,700 --> 05:59:57,420

5382
06:00:02,290 --> 06:00:14,090

5383
06:00:14,270 --> 06:00:14,990
I fucking knew it.

5384
06:00:15,270 --> 06:00:16,630
I knew I wasn't crazy.

5385
06:00:19,170 --> 06:00:19,430
There we go.

5386
06:00:20,610 --> 06:00:21,310
I knew it.

5387
06:00:23,010 --> 06:00:24,550
I could feel it in my body.

5388
06:00:24,850 --> 06:00:26,450
I could feel it in my bones.

5389
06:00:29,470 --> 06:00:30,210
Okay, nice.

5390
06:00:38,760 --> 06:00:39,560
Hello, Oswald.

5391
06:00:41,540 --> 06:00:42,740
Glad to see you can make it.

5392
06:00:42,900 --> 06:00:44,360
This is the Fireworks Control Center.

5393
06:00:44,580 --> 06:00:46,660
I use a launch on-spotted show from here.

5394
06:00:47,060 --> 06:00:50,840
On top of each of these three towers, there's a battery of deactivated rockets.

5395
06:00:51,660 --> 06:00:54,700
Activate him by climbing each tower and energize the gem you'll find there.

5396
06:00:55,920 --> 06:00:59,320
Once all three are done, race back here and it'll be showtime!

5397
06:00:59,900 --> 06:01:03,520
Even the blot won't stand a chance against all that firepower.

5398
06:01:04,060 --> 06:01:06,000
I'll distract him so he can scale the towers.

5399
06:01:06,340 --> 06:01:07,880
Let me open the doors for you!

5400
06:01:10,740 --> 06:01:13,700
When you're back, we'll trigger the show in remote control.

5401
06:01:13,880 --> 06:01:15,040
Be careful out there.

5402
06:01:15,780 --> 06:01:17,780
Alright, but how do we do this friendly?

5403
06:01:18,340 --> 06:01:18,860
Friendly.

5404
06:01:20,900 --> 06:01:24,020
How do we do it in a way that's friendly, Oswald?

5405
06:01:27,280 --> 06:01:30,240
It happens if I paint all the flowers back.

5406
06:01:32,160 --> 06:01:33,480
Oh, nothing happens.

5407
06:01:34,760 --> 06:01:35,140
Guys.

5408
06:01:36,860 --> 06:01:37,980
Does it...

5409
06:01:37,980 --> 06:01:39,800
Can I do this friendly?

5410
06:01:45,410 --> 06:01:47,150
There's no going back now.

5411
06:01:47,690 --> 06:01:49,450
Let's get to the top of the tower, Mickey.

5412
06:01:52,070 --> 06:01:54,590
Can I make friendly explosives?

5413
06:01:59,930 --> 06:02:02,570
I don't, I don't, I'm scared.

5414
06:02:06,870 --> 06:02:11,570
Is it possible to make friendly explosives?

5415
06:02:14,730 --> 06:02:16,470
Instructions unclear.

5416
06:02:18,130 --> 06:02:20,350
How to make explosive friendly.

5417
06:02:24,030 --> 06:02:25,150
Wait, why did I make it?

5418
06:02:25,170 --> 06:02:31,690
is it like oh oh it's like forest i see

5419
06:02:34,810 --> 06:02:45,290

06:02:49,480 --> 06:02:55,680

5421
06:02:58,860 --> 06:02:59,600
Hit.

5422
06:03:00,180 --> 06:03:01,660
Get that tentacle.

5423
06:03:04,320 --> 06:03:05,060
Whoops.

5424
06:03:09,660 --> 06:03:11,880
There's something up here, but can I even get there?

5425
06:03:13,580 --> 06:03:14,480
Hello, guys.

5426
06:03:16,260 --> 06:03:17,280
How do I get up there?

5427
06:03:17,840 --> 06:03:18,320
Uh.

5428
06:03:20,740 --> 06:03:22,940
Oh, we're endgame right now.

5429
06:03:27,200 --> 06:03:27,600
Okay.

5430
06:03:28,420 --> 06:03:29,360
Can delete the door.

5431
06:03:32,380 --> 06:03:35,480
I learned this in that pirate thing.

5432
06:03:36,100 --> 06:03:37,080
Alright, door deleted.

5433
06:03:42,670 --> 06:03:45,290
I didn't realize Oswald had so many chandeliers.

5434
06:03:45,750 --> 06:03:46,890
Yeah, fucking freak.

5435
06:03:50,530 --> 06:03:52,010
Oh, it's right here.

5436
06:03:52,570 --> 06:03:52,910
Yay!

5437
06:04:00,140 --> 06:04:01,760
The silver pin!

5438
06:04:06,430 --> 06:04:07,570
Alright, nice.

5439
06:04:09,710 --> 06:04:10,950
Yeah, I just got...

5440
06:04:13,130 --> 06:04:13,430
Okay.

5441
06:04:14,570 --> 06:04:15,430
Oh, come on, come on.

5442
06:04:15,470 --> 06:04:15,790
Make it, make it.

5443
06:04:15,790 --> 06:04:16,030
Yes!

5444
06:04:16,230 --> 06:04:16,730
I'm faster.

5445
06:04:18,190 --> 06:04:18,430
Nice.

5446
06:04:19,470 --> 06:04:20,710
And now we're here.

5447
06:04:25,280 --> 06:04:26,740
Wait, this looks like Kingdom Hearts.

5448
06:04:29,180 --> 06:04:30,720
It looks like that...

5449
06:04:30,720 --> 06:04:35,500
That exact level in Kingdom Hearts where you have to go up the lair thing.

5450
06:04:39,840 --> 06:04:41,120
The Wizard's Tower.

5451
06:04:42,040 --> 06:04:43,980
Oh my god, it is Kingdom Hearts.

5452
06:04:47,520 --> 06:04:48,080
What?

5453
06:04:50,640 --> 06:04:51,640
Oh, shit.

5454
06:04:52,380 --> 06:04:53,300
He's here to help me.

5455
06:04:53,880 --> 06:04:55,320
I don't think him being so powerful.

5456
06:04:55,740 --> 06:04:56,260
We're scary.

5457
06:04:56,740 --> 06:04:57,420
We're scary.

5458
06:04:57,980 --> 06:04:57,980
Please.

5459
06:04:58,680 --> 06:04:59,320
Hurry, Mickey.

5460
06:05:03,460 --> 06:05:06,580
I'm getting there as fast as I can, sir.

5461
06:05:07,680 --> 06:05:07,800
Oh!

5462
06:05:08,680 --> 06:05:10,820
I'm nice.

5463
06:05:10,980 --> 06:05:11,800
I made it.

5464
06:05:13,300 --> 06:05:13,680
Oh, shit.

5465
06:05:13,700 --> 06:05:13,880
Shit!

5466
06:05:14,140 --> 06:05:14,660
Oh my god!

5467
06:05:15,280 --> 06:05:16,520
Oh, clutch, clutch.

5468
06:05:17,140 --> 06:05:17,720
Very clutch.

5469
06:05:18,860 --> 06:05:20,080
Why can't I paint that?

5470
06:05:22,060 --> 06:05:25,740
It's coming atop Argarios that you can rotate.

5471
06:05:25,900 --> 06:05:29,740
You'll have to hit them to make them turn, then paint in their heads.

5472
06:05:32,680 --> 06:05:34,920
Okay, they have to be paying to become active.

5473
06:05:41,160 --> 06:05:41,500
Whoa!

5474
06:05:41,880 --> 06:05:43,200
Wait, you can't open his mouth!

5475
06:05:43,360 --> 06:05:46,280
How am I supposed to give him the juice?

5476
06:05:49,260 --> 06:05:50,100
Oh, shit!

5477
06:05:51,300 --> 06:05:52,860
Guys, I don't think he wants the juice.

5478
06:05:55,420 --> 06:05:58,520
I think I'm just supposed to activate this.

5479
06:05:58,640 --> 06:05:59,560
Wait, that's not fair!

5480
06:06:09,100 --> 06:06:10,300
Okay, and then I have to paint the head.

5481
06:06:11,540 --> 06:06:11,740
Okay.

5482
06:06:20,520 --> 06:06:21,500
Is it friendly?

5483
06:06:21,680 --> 06:06:22,460
Is it friendly?

5484
06:06:25,180 --> 06:06:27,020
Is this friendly thing to do?

5485
06:06:28,180 --> 06:06:28,600
Oh!

5486
06:06:31,950 --> 06:06:32,790
Is he?

5487
06:06:32,790 --> 06:06:33,590
Is he friend?

5488
06:06:34,150 --> 06:06:34,750
Is he friend?

5489
06:06:34,930 --> 06:06:35,410
It's blue!

5490
06:06:36,650 --> 06:06:37,210
It's blue!

5491
06:06:40,820 --> 06:06:41,420
It's blue!

5492
06:06:41,720 --> 06:06:42,960
That's blue juice!

5493
06:06:43,220 --> 06:06:44,300
It's the friend beam!

5494
06:06:46,060 --> 06:06:46,620
Okay.

5495
06:06:47,960 --> 06:06:48,560
All right.

5496
06:06:49,620 --> 06:06:52,080
And now I just have to do that three more two more times.

5497
06:06:53,080 --> 06:06:53,860
The friendship.

5498
06:06:54,600 --> 06:06:55,520
It's blue!

5499
06:06:56,220 --> 06:06:57,020
Blue friend!

5500
06:06:58,940 --> 06:07:01,240
Okay, I just have to do that two more times.

5501
06:07:02,320 --> 06:07:03,060
Friend beam.

5502
06:07:04,140 --> 06:07:28,470

5506
06:08:05,550 --> 06:08:07,430
Mickey confirmed on Smash.

5507
06:08:07,890 --> 06:08:09,330
What the fuck?

5508
06:08:11,370 --> 06:08:12,910
He's not stopping.

5509
06:08:14,670 --> 06:08:15,810
What's wrong with you?

5510
06:08:22,550 --> 06:08:23,450
Oh, I can...

5511
06:08:23,450 --> 06:08:24,410
Oh, I can kill him.

5512
06:08:24,510 --> 06:08:24,790
Okay.

5513
06:08:25,170 --> 06:08:26,370
That's what's wrong with him.

5514
06:08:27,230 --> 06:08:28,750
I didn't know I could fucking kill him.

5515
06:08:30,550 --> 06:08:33,830
Technically, I'm not a murderer when he's not even, like...

5516
06:08:33,850 --> 06:08:38,770
when he's not technically he has no brain it's not murder when he's already a vegetable

5517
06:08:42,500 --> 06:08:43,540

06:09:19,760 --> 06:09:21,560
I'm lawful good, guys.

5521
06:09:22,500 --> 06:09:23,380
So good.

5522
06:09:24,500 --> 06:09:29,620
I'm so good that, like, they need to create a new category for me for how lawful I am.

5523
06:09:31,520 --> 06:09:32,760
Let's open this chest.

5524
06:09:43,960 --> 06:09:44,320
Alright.

5525
06:09:44,540 --> 06:09:45,260
Up I go.

5526
06:09:47,280 --> 06:09:47,560
Yay!

5527
06:09:48,680 --> 06:09:49,000
What?

5528
06:09:50,060 --> 06:09:52,180
Oh my god, the darkness is coming.

5529
06:09:53,280 --> 06:09:54,020
Oh my god.

5530
06:09:55,160 --> 06:09:56,840
Sora, Where are you?

5531
06:09:57,700 --> 06:09:59,520
The darkness are coming!

5532
06:09:59,880 --> 06:10:01,300
The heartless are here!

5533
06:10:02,540 --> 06:10:03,120
Ow!

5534
06:10:04,340 --> 06:10:07,200
Okay, how the fuck was I supposed to know it would do that?

5535
06:10:12,670 --> 06:10:13,150
Yeah.

5536
06:10:14,470 --> 06:10:15,450
What happened?

5537
06:10:15,850 --> 06:10:16,690
Oh shit, hello!

5538
06:10:19,470 --> 06:10:21,450
Oh, I mean, hi.

5539
06:10:22,950 --> 06:10:27,030
I mean, that's nice of them to just say hi to me, I guess.

5540
06:10:29,310 --> 06:10:30,850
Trying to say hi.

5541
06:10:36,220 --> 06:10:38,520
Jesus Christ, it's just...

5542
06:10:38,520 --> 06:10:40,720
It's destroying the entire real estate.

5543
06:10:41,240 --> 06:10:43,380
The property value is going to go down, man.

5544
06:10:43,480 --> 06:10:44,380
How are we going to resell?

5545
06:10:44,580 --> 06:10:44,980
Oh!

5546
06:10:46,800 --> 06:10:47,720
I'm okay.

5547
06:10:50,000 --> 06:10:51,180
Oh, it's time.

5548
06:10:52,760 --> 06:10:54,220
It's friendship beam time.

5549
06:11:01,600 --> 06:11:02,240
Okay.

5550
06:11:02,820 --> 06:11:03,320
Oh, shit.

5551
06:11:04,840 --> 06:11:05,380
It's fine.

5552
06:11:05,820 --> 06:11:06,280
We're okay.

5553
06:11:12,170 --> 06:11:12,910
Beam!

5554
06:11:15,490 --> 06:11:16,290
God, we're beaming.

5555
06:11:16,470 --> 06:11:16,830
We're beaming.

5556
06:11:19,730 --> 06:11:20,050
We're beaming.

5557
06:11:20,050 --> 06:11:20,350
We're beaming.

5558
06:11:20,610 --> 06:11:21,750
We're forcing friendships.

5559
06:11:23,250 --> 06:11:24,610
The doky way.

5560
06:11:34,060 --> 06:11:35,080
Friendship beam!

5561
06:11:36,120 --> 06:11:37,080
Get out!

5562
06:11:37,790 --> 06:11:38,420
That's right!

5563
06:11:38,560 --> 06:11:39,580
Take my friendship!

5564
06:11:41,260 --> 06:11:42,700
All right, one more.

5565
06:11:43,180 --> 06:11:43,980
One more friendship.

5566
06:11:44,100 --> 06:11:44,880
beam.

5567
06:11:50,860 --> 06:11:51,560
Take it!

5568
06:11:52,640 --> 06:11:53,060
Okay.

5569
06:11:55,300 --> 06:12:00,860
Let's grab HP real quick, and that should be good.

5570
06:12:02,140 --> 06:12:02,860
One more.

5571
06:12:03,700 --> 06:12:05,340
One more love bomb.

5572
06:12:07,220 --> 06:12:08,100
For the ride.

5573
06:12:12,320 --> 06:12:12,800
Yes.

5574
06:12:13,660 --> 06:12:15,120
Because it's how you make friends, guys.

5575
06:12:15,480 --> 06:12:16,400
It's just that easy.

5576
06:12:19,340 --> 06:12:20,080
Okay.

5577
06:12:20,100 --> 06:12:20,600
Oh

5578
06:12:32,900 --> 06:12:37,420
Please no Oh shit, it's time.

5579
06:12:38,020 --> 06:12:38,460
Oh shit.

5580
06:12:38,560 --> 06:12:39,920
I thought it'll go back down.

5581
06:12:40,440 --> 06:12:45,660
Okay, I can't fuck around here I didn't realize this was actually time

5582
06:12:49,040 --> 06:12:50,880
The water is actually coming up

5583
06:12:53,920 --> 06:13:04,780
Okay, but there might be a film here So that it's worth it I actually like What was the point of going up here?

5584
06:13:06,680 --> 06:13:11,440
I think it's fine I don't think I need another film anyway Oh my god Why is it so fast?

5585
06:13:11,760 --> 06:13:13,180
Why did it become so fast?

5586
06:13:13,300 --> 06:13:36,700
Okay, that's fine Yeah, we're going about We just dropped That was that I saw the water just travel exponentially faster That's why we don't need the film We can't even go back to like the usher anyway We already got everything we need anyway

5587
06:13:40,580 --> 06:13:44,680
I'm pretty sure the film doesn't affect it Doesn't affect the good or bad

5588
06:13:49,580 --> 06:13:59,340
Alright up we go Yay One last tower It's the final countdown, everyone.

5589
06:14:02,040 --> 06:14:03,360
It's supposed to be here.

5590
06:14:04,740 --> 06:14:06,140
What do I do now?

5591
06:14:07,420 --> 06:14:07,840
Hello?

5592
06:14:11,240 --> 06:14:12,040
What?

5593
06:14:12,820 --> 06:14:14,260
Oh, did I jump?

5594
06:14:14,780 --> 06:14:15,180
What?

5595
06:14:20,500 --> 06:14:21,020
Here?

5596
06:14:23,120 --> 06:14:23,840
Oh!

5597
06:14:24,720 --> 06:14:26,020
Oh, cheeky.

5598
06:14:27,380 --> 06:14:28,300
Oh, never mind.

5599
06:14:28,440 --> 06:14:29,000
No, it's a trap.

5600
06:14:30,420 --> 06:14:34,300
I was like, oh, cheeky, that's so smart.

5601
06:14:34,880 --> 06:14:36,560
No, I just fell for a trap.

5602
06:14:38,160 --> 06:14:39,580
It was a trap all along.

5603
06:14:44,560 --> 06:14:45,080
This way.

5604
06:14:46,920 --> 06:14:47,960
Actually, I needed that.

5605
06:14:49,340 --> 06:14:49,920
That's good.

5606
06:14:49,960 --> 06:14:52,000
I needed to refill my pain anyway.

5607
06:14:56,400 --> 06:14:57,980
Cheeky trap indeed.

5608
06:15:01,700 --> 06:15:03,080
Fine, I got refill.

5609
06:15:03,260 --> 06:15:03,940
I reloaded.

5610
06:15:06,840 --> 06:15:08,760
Oh, almost got me.

5611
06:15:10,260 --> 06:15:12,440
Okay, now it's more fighting.

5612
06:15:13,680 --> 06:15:15,620
Alright, I'll use this on the mob.

5613
06:15:16,480 --> 06:15:18,120
Okay, that's not the mob.

5614
06:15:20,660 --> 06:15:22,460
Aim assist failed.

5615
06:15:24,980 --> 06:15:27,260
Now they're trapped in here with me.

5616
06:15:30,820 --> 06:15:31,920
Wait, you're...

5617
06:15:31,920 --> 06:15:33,140
Why are you fighting each other?

5618
06:15:33,600 --> 06:15:34,660
I thought you're friends.

5619
06:15:36,960 --> 06:15:38,360
I didn't get the refill.

5620
06:15:45,900 --> 06:15:46,440
Okay, you're right.

5621
06:15:46,660 --> 06:15:48,240
I didn't have the red eyes, so the...

5622
06:15:48,240 --> 06:15:51,320
The aim assistant didn't work.

5623
06:15:53,020 --> 06:15:54,140
Hmm, is it worth it?

5624
06:15:55,220 --> 06:15:56,020
Ah, fuck it.

5625
06:15:57,740 --> 06:16:02,180
Oh my god, imagine if I got on the wrong platform, and then this thing dropped.

5626
06:16:03,460 --> 06:16:06,180
And I just see the red chest fall down.

5627
06:16:11,400 --> 06:16:11,840
Alright.

5628
06:16:16,720 --> 06:16:18,200
Okay, nice.

5629
06:16:18,820 --> 06:16:19,920
Alright, grab the chest.

5630
06:16:28,940 --> 06:16:32,060
Okay, let's get the little gesture men.

5631
06:16:33,260 --> 06:16:33,720
Okay.

5632
06:16:35,320 --> 06:16:36,580
That's what we wanted.

5633
06:16:38,840 --> 06:16:39,760
Alright, nice.

5634
06:16:40,500 --> 06:16:40,800
Okay.

5635
06:16:41,480 --> 06:16:43,740
Now we just pour it.

5636
06:16:44,620 --> 06:16:45,620
Open wide.

5637
06:16:46,580 --> 06:16:47,020
Nice.

5638
06:16:48,720 --> 06:16:49,800
That's good.

5639
06:16:50,300 --> 06:16:50,940
That's good.

5640
06:16:51,080 --> 06:16:52,380
They're hitting them, not me.

5641
06:16:53,120 --> 06:16:53,920
Say ah.

5642
06:16:55,420 --> 06:16:56,320
That's right.

5643
06:16:56,940 --> 06:16:57,160
Ah.

5644
06:16:58,100 --> 06:16:59,200
Okay, one more hit.

5645
06:17:04,090 --> 06:17:04,230
Yay.

5646
06:17:05,170 --> 06:17:05,550
What?

5647
06:17:06,850 --> 06:17:07,590
Guys, please.

5648
06:17:07,930 --> 06:17:08,170
Please.

5649
06:17:08,470 --> 06:17:09,170
I just, please.

5650
06:17:09,330 --> 06:17:10,650
We're trying to make him our friend.

5651
06:17:11,090 --> 06:17:11,550
Guys, please.

5652
06:17:12,390 --> 06:17:12,790
Please.

5653
06:17:13,110 --> 06:17:13,370
Please.

5654
06:17:13,690 --> 06:17:14,930
Oh my god, you're worthless.

5655
06:17:15,670 --> 06:17:16,870
You're actually worthless.

5656
06:17:18,850 --> 06:17:19,950
Okay, now he's my friend.

5657
06:17:21,130 --> 06:17:21,350
Yay.

5658
06:17:21,530 --> 06:17:21,910
Let's go.

5659
06:17:22,470 --> 06:17:23,850
all the pain, guys.

5660
06:17:26,750 --> 06:17:29,610
Maybe it is a little bad that they're eating paint.

5661
06:17:35,740 --> 06:17:39,000
Sometimes having too many friends is not the right answer.

5662
06:17:42,320 --> 06:17:43,240
Up we go.

5663
06:17:45,700 --> 06:17:46,240
Alright.

5664
06:17:47,880 --> 06:17:49,420
Final friendship beam.

5665
06:17:56,780 --> 06:17:58,000
Something doesn't feel right.

5666
06:17:58,140 --> 06:17:58,820
Wait, you're right.

5667
06:18:00,460 --> 06:18:01,520
Where did he go?

5668
06:18:01,540 --> 06:18:07,000
Wait, am I supposed to activate the friendship beam?

5669
06:18:08,660 --> 06:18:09,220
Where is he?

5670
06:18:15,200 --> 06:18:16,300
Where is he?

5671
06:18:17,900 --> 06:18:18,900
Wait a minute.

5672
06:18:23,410 --> 06:18:24,190
Where's the...

5673
06:18:24,190 --> 06:18:24,810
Where is he?

5674
06:18:24,890 --> 06:18:25,770
Where did he go?

5675
06:18:31,220 --> 06:18:33,020
Something feels sus.

5676
06:18:39,850 --> 06:18:41,970
Back to the fireworks control tower.

5677
06:18:43,830 --> 06:18:44,570
Alright.

5678
06:18:45,690 --> 06:18:47,090
Where did he go?

5679
06:18:50,250 --> 06:18:52,150
Where am I beaming it to?

5680
06:18:54,590 --> 06:18:56,690
Oh, the bolt is in here.

5681
06:18:57,690 --> 06:18:59,030
Did he figure out what I was doing?

5682
06:18:59,890 --> 06:19:02,170
Oh my god, how did they figure it out?

5683
06:19:02,290 --> 06:19:06,330
Is it the fireworks on the towers?

5684
06:19:09,010 --> 06:19:10,450
There's no way.

5685
06:19:11,110 --> 06:19:12,310
How did he know?

5686
06:19:12,990 --> 06:19:16,310
How could he have possibly No, I wonder.

5687
06:19:19,310 --> 06:19:20,050
No.

5688
06:19:22,210 --> 06:19:24,170
You think he saw the fireworks?

5689
06:19:29,750 --> 06:19:30,510
Oh, shit.

5690
06:19:31,690 --> 06:19:32,470
Down I go.

5691
06:19:32,870 --> 06:19:33,990
Who leaked it?

5692
06:19:34,230 --> 06:19:34,790
Oswald!

5693
06:19:37,090 --> 06:19:38,250
Oh, fuck.

5694
06:19:39,510 --> 06:19:39,790
What?

5695
06:19:40,630 --> 06:19:41,090
Painting.

5696
06:19:47,370 --> 06:19:48,690
What the fuck do I do?

5697
06:19:52,050 --> 06:19:53,310
Down I'll go.

5698
06:19:53,530 --> 06:19:54,130
Oh, hey, Anvil.

5699
06:19:56,370 --> 06:19:56,770
Am I?

5700
06:19:58,970 --> 06:20:00,850
Am I supposed to do anything?

5701
06:20:01,010 --> 06:20:02,130
Or am I just fucked?

5702
06:20:02,510 --> 06:20:05,430
Am I just falling to my death?

5703
06:20:07,930 --> 06:20:08,850
Stream sniping?

5704
06:20:09,650 --> 06:20:10,430
No way.

5705
06:20:10,910 --> 06:20:11,770
Couldn't have.

5706
06:20:15,040 --> 06:20:17,380
Oh my god, he's stream sniping me.

5707
06:20:20,880 --> 06:20:21,900
Skydiver pit.

5708
06:20:21,960 --> 06:20:22,500
I don't think...

5709
06:20:22,500 --> 06:20:27,380
Smacking into my face, my face into the wall is considered skydiving.

5710
06:20:29,200 --> 06:20:30,160
Okay, we need to get to Oswald.

5711
06:20:30,860 --> 06:20:31,760
Oh shit!

5712
06:20:35,860 --> 06:20:37,400
Okay, we need to get to Oswald.

5713
06:20:40,520 --> 06:20:44,040
Okay, now, now we can get to Oswald.

5714
06:20:45,420 --> 06:20:46,540
How do we get to Oswald?

5715
06:20:50,380 --> 06:20:50,940
What?

5716
06:20:53,440 --> 06:20:55,280
How the fuck do I get to him?

5717
06:20:57,840 --> 06:20:58,180
Hello?

5718
06:20:59,140 --> 06:20:59,760
Oh, here.

5719
06:21:02,120 --> 06:21:03,500
Yeah, because I was like, excuse me?

5720
06:21:03,580 --> 06:21:04,780
Where the fuck do I go?

5721
06:21:08,100 --> 06:21:10,060
Okay, let's grab this pin real quick.

5722
06:21:14,530 --> 06:21:14,970
Yay!

5723
06:21:15,370 --> 06:21:16,430
Silver pin!

5724
06:21:24,230 --> 06:21:26,670
Okay, I don't know why I destroyed it.

5725
06:21:28,790 --> 06:21:30,910
I might not have been very smart of me to do.

5726
06:21:36,400 --> 06:21:37,100
What did I do?

5727
06:21:39,340 --> 06:21:40,380
What did I do?

5728
06:21:43,120 --> 06:21:43,660
Oh, shit.

5729
06:21:43,820 --> 06:21:44,100
Nice.

5730
06:21:45,160 --> 06:21:46,360
Wait, which way do I go?

5731
06:21:48,180 --> 06:21:49,140
Okay, I went that way.

5732
06:21:49,860 --> 06:21:50,020
Okay.

5733
06:21:53,200 --> 06:21:53,600
Come on.

5734
06:21:53,700 --> 06:21:54,060
Come on.

5735
06:21:54,080 --> 06:21:54,500
I can make it.

5736
06:21:54,560 --> 06:21:54,860
Nice.

5737
06:21:56,700 --> 06:21:57,420
I'm gaming.

5738
06:21:59,440 --> 06:22:00,260
Alright, I made it.

5739
06:22:02,200 --> 06:22:03,200
What's over here?

5740
06:22:04,620 --> 06:22:05,160
Oh, shit.

5741
06:22:06,640 --> 06:22:07,340
Oh, shit.

5742
06:22:08,720 --> 06:22:10,900
It was like that when I got here, guys.

5743
06:22:13,520 --> 06:22:14,360
I swear to God.

5744
06:22:16,080 --> 06:22:17,520
It was like that when I got here.

5745
06:22:18,860 --> 06:22:20,700
The platform was already collapsed.

5746
06:22:25,410 --> 06:22:26,930
Why is it all green paint?

5747
06:22:30,570 --> 06:22:31,750
I didn't touch anything.

5748
06:22:31,930 --> 06:22:33,530
I didn't pull any lever, chat, I swear.

5749
06:22:34,910 --> 06:22:35,170
Yay!

5750
06:22:35,750 --> 06:22:36,650
My gold pin!

5751
06:22:37,890 --> 06:22:39,930
I don't even know why I'm collecting these any.

5752
06:22:41,090 --> 06:22:46,130
I'm like thinking, wait, maybe collecting these pins have been pretty pointless.

5753
06:22:46,870 --> 06:22:48,070
Like, what the fuck am I doing?

5754
06:22:48,170 --> 06:22:52,990
I could have finished this game like three hours ago if I fucking stopped collecting pins.

5755
06:23:00,230 --> 06:23:02,570
There is a tentacle here, but...

5756
06:23:02,570 --> 06:23:03,690
Oh, okay, I was gonna stay.

5757
06:23:07,390 --> 06:23:07,910
Please.

5758
06:23:09,430 --> 06:23:11,010
All right, get down.

5759
06:23:11,350 --> 06:23:11,690
Maybe.

5760
06:23:14,630 --> 06:23:15,170
Yay!

5761
06:23:17,570 --> 06:23:19,530
I did it.

5762
06:23:22,310 --> 06:23:23,570
All right.

5763
06:23:24,790 --> 06:23:26,850
Let's patch this tentacle up.

5764
06:23:29,090 --> 06:23:30,860
We're almost there.

5765
06:23:31,950 --> 06:23:32,170
Ah!

5766
06:23:33,470 --> 06:23:34,410
Shit.

5767
06:23:36,470 --> 06:23:38,370
So I can get my 91 premium.

5768
06:23:38,390 --> 06:23:40,330
completion rate.

5769
06:23:43,730 --> 06:23:45,190
And they grab my HP back.

5770
06:23:45,310 --> 06:23:46,150
Oswald, I'm back!

5771
06:23:46,690 --> 06:23:47,550
I made it!

5772
06:23:48,450 --> 06:23:49,610
Oh, that's his girlfriend!

5773
06:23:51,450 --> 06:23:52,530
There she is.

5774
06:23:53,450 --> 06:23:54,650
That works already!

5775
06:23:55,090 --> 06:23:55,390
Uh-huh!

5776
06:23:56,130 --> 06:23:56,930
Great job.

5777
06:23:59,190 --> 06:24:00,170
Batteries are dead.

5778
06:24:00,670 --> 06:24:01,890
I'll replace them in a jiffy.

5779
06:24:02,710 --> 06:24:04,310
That should have been the first thing they did.

5780
06:24:08,110 --> 06:24:09,230
It's not a statue.

5781
06:24:10,490 --> 06:24:11,050
That's...

5782
06:24:12,350 --> 06:24:36,930
what's left over after we balled up the ball I'm so sorry I messed up oh you didn't mean to for a while I didn't mean to the rocket never mind I made my share of misses seems we both need some forgiveness wait any more confessions I forgive you for killing my wife

5783
06:24:41,970 --> 06:24:42,410
Oh!

5784
06:24:43,370 --> 06:24:43,810
Oswald!

5785
06:24:45,410 --> 06:24:50,370
That's like crazy that he just forgives him for killing his girlfriend like that.

5786
06:24:51,350 --> 06:24:55,810
Oh my god, bro, she's just a stand- that's when you know he's evil.

5787
06:24:56,310 --> 06:24:59,490
He's like, yeah, your girlfriend's a statue now, but like, you know what?

5788
06:24:59,650 --> 06:25:01,470
Fuck you, I'm grabbing her too.

5789
06:25:05,390 --> 06:25:09,510
Oswald should have told Mickey, like, let me turn your girlfriend into a statue and then we're even.

5790
06:25:13,820 --> 06:25:15,860
Yeah, I know, like, why the girlfriend as well?

5791
06:25:15,880 --> 06:25:29,020
like she's already technically dead it's like going to her grave and just decide to like dig up her body and then burn it that's how fucked up it was oh I'm inside him nice

5792
06:25:34,020 --> 06:25:37,600
oh sweet I'm inside him now

5793
06:25:40,840 --> 06:25:42,120
devoured village

5794
06:25:46,220 --> 06:25:49,120
yeah You go back to sleep, sir.

5795
06:25:50,080 --> 06:25:51,380
I've become your friend.

5796
06:25:52,120 --> 06:25:53,160
And I sleep forever.

5797
06:25:56,620 --> 06:25:57,000
Alright.

5798
06:25:58,300 --> 06:25:58,820
Oh, hello.

5799
06:25:59,680 --> 06:26:00,680
Boy, am I glad to see you.

5800
06:26:00,760 --> 06:26:03,660
I got separated from Oswald after the bloke grabbed us.

5801
06:26:03,980 --> 06:26:04,560
I think we're inside.

5802
06:26:04,600 --> 06:26:05,620
See, we're inside him.

5803
06:26:05,680 --> 06:26:06,220
The bloke.

5804
06:26:06,480 --> 06:26:07,460
And the bloke grabbed me.

5805
06:26:07,520 --> 06:26:08,380
I dropped the remote.

5806
06:26:08,720 --> 06:26:09,860
Unless Oswald found it.

5807
06:26:09,920 --> 06:26:10,740
It's gone forever.

5808
06:26:10,860 --> 06:26:11,480
I'm sorry.

5809
06:26:11,980 --> 06:26:14,120
From now on, I'll follow you in the help whenever I can.

5810
06:26:14,420 --> 06:26:14,980
Lead on.

5811
06:26:15,940 --> 06:26:16,340
Alright.

5812
06:26:17,940 --> 06:26:20,340
I swear, these guys have not been threatening at all.

5813
06:26:20,480 --> 06:26:21,540
All they do is just leave.

5814
06:26:21,980 --> 06:26:25,660
Like, I don't know what their purpose is.

5815
06:26:26,000 --> 06:26:26,680
They just leave.

5816
06:26:30,760 --> 06:26:32,220
Yeah, it's gold pin.

5817
06:26:33,220 --> 06:26:38,500
My 91% completion rate is down 91.1%.

5818
06:26:39,640 --> 06:26:41,380
I think I was not missing up here.

5819
06:26:41,620 --> 06:26:41,920
No.

5820
06:26:44,260 --> 06:26:45,600
We're literally just chilling.

5821
06:26:45,940 --> 06:26:46,180
Yeah.

5822
06:26:46,840 --> 06:26:48,300
Oh, that's my heart.

5823
06:26:48,400 --> 06:26:49,360
That's a big-ass fucker.

5824
06:26:49,380 --> 06:26:50,320
looking hard, Mickey.

5825
06:26:50,840 --> 06:26:52,260
Before capitalism got you.

5826
06:26:53,340 --> 06:26:54,360
That appears to be your heart.

5827
06:26:54,760 --> 06:26:57,460
That means the vault can enter your world when he gains enough strength.

5828
06:26:58,000 --> 06:27:00,200
You must take it back before it happens.

5829
06:27:03,620 --> 06:27:03,860
There.

5830
06:27:04,040 --> 06:27:07,620
That's the honorable point on when the bloodicle is holding your heart.

5831
06:27:08,380 --> 06:27:09,240
Oh, there's Oswald!

5832
06:27:10,260 --> 06:27:10,940
It'll be okay.

5833
06:27:11,220 --> 06:27:13,940
We can lock, but we must hurry.

5834
06:27:15,560 --> 06:27:18,560
He was such a sweet kid before capitalism, guys.

5835
06:27:27,040 --> 06:27:33,140
Wait, how the fuck was he already, like, on my side?

5836
06:27:34,700 --> 06:27:36,380
Oh, wait, look, there he is just sleeping.

5837
06:27:36,800 --> 06:27:38,120
He literally didn't do anything.

5838
06:27:38,300 --> 06:27:39,500
He just slept.

5839
06:27:40,480 --> 06:27:41,300
That's crazy.

5840
06:27:45,530 --> 06:27:45,910
Alright.

5841
06:27:47,670 --> 06:27:48,550
Anything else here?

5842
06:27:50,750 --> 06:27:51,870
Wait, that's it?

5843
06:27:55,150 --> 06:27:56,430
Oh, do I have to go up?

5844
06:27:56,730 --> 06:27:58,130
I must have to go up now.

5845
06:28:00,050 --> 06:28:01,210
Oh, yeah, there it is.

5846
06:28:06,490 --> 06:28:07,470
What the fuck?

5847
06:28:11,920 --> 06:28:16,400
Can I, like, turn them into good people?

5848
06:28:19,380 --> 06:28:20,880
Is he turning blue?

5849
06:28:23,740 --> 06:28:25,300
Guys, I don't think they're turning blue.

5850
06:28:25,620 --> 06:28:27,560
Guys, I don't think they're turning blue, guys.

5851
06:28:28,100 --> 06:28:28,960
Guys, guys!

5852
06:28:29,420 --> 06:28:30,180
Guys, I'm...

5853
06:28:30,420 --> 06:28:30,580
Oh,

5854
06:28:35,470 --> 06:28:36,090
don't!

5855
06:28:36,950 --> 06:28:37,430
Ah!

5856
06:28:42,230 --> 06:28:44,790
I don't know what happened!

5857
06:28:45,510 --> 06:28:46,690
I don't know what happened!

5858
06:28:46,970 --> 06:28:48,430
I just got stuck!

5859
06:28:54,900 --> 06:28:58,080
I got stuck, Sepra.

5860
06:29:01,180 --> 06:29:03,140
I don't know what happened.

5861
06:29:03,280 --> 06:29:04,040
It just...

5862
06:29:04,040 --> 06:29:05,240
It just got stuck.

5863
06:29:12,300 --> 06:29:13,300
That's fucked up.

5864
06:29:13,680 --> 06:29:15,180
That's actually so fucked up.

5865
06:29:17,840 --> 06:29:19,100
Wait, how do I...

5866
06:29:21,020 --> 06:29:25,460
Thing is that I'm pretty sure I can get across there.

5867
06:29:27,300 --> 06:29:28,120
Oh yeah, there's a painting.

5868
06:29:30,680 --> 06:29:32,700
Yeah, I'm just gonna sit there.

5869
06:29:33,660 --> 06:29:34,540
What about here?

5870
06:29:38,280 --> 06:29:40,380
Bum bum bum bum.

5871
06:29:42,300 --> 06:29:44,900
Like, what is being up here for?

5872
06:29:47,080 --> 06:29:48,320
Wait, somebody's sleeping.

5873
06:29:50,020 --> 06:29:51,540
Be very, very quiet.

5874
06:29:53,940 --> 06:29:55,580
Somebody ZZ-Z-Zing right now.

5875
06:29:56,840 --> 06:29:58,240
I guess there's nothing here?

5876
06:29:58,500 --> 06:30:00,420
What the fuck was the point of being up there?

5877
06:30:02,680 --> 06:30:03,240
Alright.

5878
06:30:03,960 --> 06:30:04,860
This is fine.

5879
06:30:06,900 --> 06:30:08,480
Okay, I don't know if I'm...

5880
06:30:09,160 --> 06:30:10,380
If I can...

5881
06:30:10,380 --> 06:30:12,280
I don't think I'm supposed...

5882
06:30:12,300 --> 06:30:14,120
to kill them?

5883
06:30:16,260 --> 06:30:18,780
I think that...

5884
06:30:18,780 --> 06:30:19,900
I don't know.

5885
06:30:19,980 --> 06:30:22,720
It doesn't feel like a good thing to do.

5886
06:30:25,800 --> 06:30:28,240
I'll just let them chill.

5887
06:30:29,260 --> 06:30:31,500
No, if I use thinner, that's bad.

5888
06:30:32,200 --> 06:30:33,080
Holy shit.

5889
06:30:33,260 --> 06:30:34,680
Holy shit, they kill themselves.

5890
06:30:35,460 --> 06:30:36,240
I'll just walk away.

5891
06:30:38,780 --> 06:30:40,800
The power of just walking away.

5892
06:30:41,900 --> 06:30:43,700
Let's take Technically, I didn't kill them.

5893
06:30:46,880 --> 06:30:48,900
Cartoon characters consumed by the bullet.

5894
06:30:51,300 --> 06:30:52,320
Technically, I'm not killing them.

5895
06:30:53,000 --> 06:30:54,120
I just walk away.

5896
06:30:55,340 --> 06:30:57,180
So I didn't commit any crime.

5897
06:31:01,080 --> 06:31:04,100
If you just walk away, there's no crime committed.

5898
06:31:06,060 --> 06:31:07,760
You're just ignoring the problem.

5899
06:31:08,060 --> 06:31:08,800
And that's different.

5900
06:31:10,460 --> 06:31:12,220
I'm just a bystander.

5901
06:31:14,240 --> 06:31:15,880
Oh, it's all the Pete's.

5902
06:31:18,940 --> 06:31:21,580
You're honest, she just walked away.

5903
06:31:24,660 --> 06:31:26,720
I hope that free them somehow.

5904
06:31:27,080 --> 06:31:28,780
Wait, did I free them?

5905
06:31:33,200 --> 06:31:34,540
I free them.

5906
06:31:34,980 --> 06:31:37,240
You said hopefully that frees them.

5907
06:31:37,980 --> 06:31:41,440
And like, that's good?

5908
06:31:42,260 --> 06:31:46,820
I don't know.

5909
06:31:48,320 --> 06:31:49,740
He said, hopefully.

5910
06:31:51,540 --> 06:31:53,160
I'm believing in that hope.

5911
06:31:54,640 --> 06:31:56,680
I freed them in a way.

5912
06:31:57,280 --> 06:32:00,500
Will I help you go to sleep at night?

5913
06:32:08,440 --> 06:32:09,080
Jesus.

5914
06:32:09,700 --> 06:32:10,640
He's like, wow.

5915
06:32:17,330 --> 06:32:20,030
Looks like the blood are spawning defenses.

5916
06:32:20,330 --> 06:32:22,150
Those splatters are like his antibodies.

5917
06:32:22,470 --> 06:32:23,670
And we are the virus.

5918
06:32:25,670 --> 06:32:26,630
That's why we got one.

5919
06:32:27,970 --> 06:32:29,230
We can get more.

5920
06:32:30,790 --> 06:32:31,390
It's fine.

5921
06:32:33,430 --> 06:32:37,810
I feel like my fucking pain should be stronger, too.

5922
06:32:42,320 --> 06:32:43,240
Alright, last one.

5923
06:32:43,960 --> 06:32:45,060
We got him in the corner.

5924
06:32:50,500 --> 06:32:51,200
Oh my god!

5925
06:32:51,380 --> 06:32:51,560
Okay.

5926
06:32:53,100 --> 06:32:55,860
I think they're friends now?

5927
06:32:57,900 --> 06:32:59,200
Question mark?

5928
06:33:06,450 --> 06:33:07,350
Okay, nice.

5929
06:33:09,930 --> 06:33:11,070
Okay, let me try.

5930
06:33:14,190 --> 06:33:15,390
Maybe eventually...

5931
06:33:15,390 --> 06:33:17,130
Guys, it doesn't look like he's...

5932
06:33:17,130 --> 06:33:19,010
Guys, I don't think it's working.

5933
06:33:19,890 --> 06:33:20,230
It's okay.

5934
06:33:21,650 --> 06:33:22,970
I'm not hitting them.

5935
06:33:24,090 --> 06:33:25,490
I'm not hitting them.

5936
06:33:25,810 --> 06:33:27,290
So I'm not doing anything bad.

5937
06:33:29,210 --> 06:33:30,290
Oh my god.

5938
06:33:31,910 --> 06:33:32,370
Okay.

5939
06:33:34,570 --> 06:33:36,090
Oh my god, he's just there.

5940
06:33:36,770 --> 06:33:37,530
Okay, it's fine.

5941
06:33:37,630 --> 06:33:38,250
I have the high ground.

5942
06:33:38,490 --> 06:33:39,030
You can't get me.

5943
06:33:40,390 --> 06:33:41,210
It's okay.

5944
06:33:41,570 --> 06:33:42,270
It's okay.

5945
06:33:42,370 --> 06:33:43,310
I have the high ground.

5946
06:33:44,210 --> 06:33:45,130
You couldn't get me.

5947
06:33:53,090 --> 06:33:54,170
That's right, Anakin.

5948
06:33:56,930 --> 06:33:57,890
Jesus Christ.

5949
06:33:58,290 --> 06:33:58,290
Okay.

5950
06:33:59,490 --> 06:34:02,250
I know they apparently can't stand on ledge.

5951
06:34:02,390 --> 06:34:05,170
They can, like, go up, so I can literally just chill here.

5952
06:34:06,850 --> 06:34:07,870
I'll just chill here.

5953
06:34:08,350 --> 06:34:09,430
Because they can't reach me.

5954
06:34:09,950 --> 06:34:10,770
See, look at them.

5955
06:34:11,410 --> 06:34:12,450
Look at these guys.

5956
06:34:12,870 --> 06:34:13,610
I'm just chilling.

5957
06:34:16,490 --> 06:34:17,430
What's over here?

5958
06:34:17,550 --> 06:34:17,990
Oh, nothing.

5959
06:34:22,100 --> 06:34:23,900
Nothing to worry about.

5960
06:34:28,760 --> 06:34:35,680
As long as I have, as long as I have, like, one center meters above ground, they can't get me.

5961
06:34:37,880 --> 06:34:38,200
Yay!

5962
06:34:39,680 --> 06:34:40,560
I'm truck.

5963
06:34:40,720 --> 06:34:41,680
Have money.

5964
06:34:42,120 --> 06:34:43,780
Mushy, thank you for the super chat.

5965
06:34:43,940 --> 06:34:44,300
Thank you.

5966
06:34:44,720 --> 06:34:45,100
Thank you.

5967
06:34:47,760 --> 06:34:50,460

06:35:20,790 --> 06:35:20,890
Ow!

5971
06:35:21,190 --> 06:35:22,110
What the fuck?

5972
06:35:28,810 --> 06:35:30,870
Oh, he's summoning more defenses!

5973
06:35:35,220 --> 06:35:37,120
Wait, which ones are the bad and which one?

5974
06:35:37,160 --> 06:35:38,200
There's so many of them.

5975
06:35:38,320 --> 06:35:40,100
Which one's good and which one's bad?

5976
06:35:42,280 --> 06:35:44,600
Oh my god, they're just beating each other up.

5977
06:35:46,840 --> 06:35:47,640
I can't tell.

5978
06:35:48,060 --> 06:35:49,280
They're just beating each other up.

5979
06:35:49,380 --> 06:35:49,920
I can't tell.

5980
06:35:54,830 --> 06:35:55,250
Nice.

5981
06:35:55,450 --> 06:35:55,730
Nice.

5982
06:35:56,450 --> 06:35:58,090
All right, the last heart.

5983
06:35:59,310 --> 06:36:00,350
Hold the light.

5984
06:36:00,690 --> 06:36:01,970
They don't even know.

5985
06:36:02,350 --> 06:36:04,090
They're like, are you good, Jerry?

5986
06:36:06,990 --> 06:36:08,630
They don't even know.

5987
06:36:11,770 --> 06:36:12,710
No, he's a good one.

5988
06:36:12,850 --> 06:36:13,930
I already converted him.

5989
06:36:14,910 --> 06:36:16,870
But the power of paint

5990
06:36:19,960 --> 06:36:24,040
is...

5991
06:36:24,040 --> 06:36:24,360
Pop!

5992
06:36:31,420 --> 06:37:04,300
God that sound when it goes like it's so fucking loud trying to have high ground here all right the last one quick seal the kill hole okay high ground all right where's the next one wait where's the next one where's the next paint nice Wait, where is it?

5993
06:37:06,480 --> 06:37:07,600
Wait, where is it?

5994
06:37:09,300 --> 06:37:10,080
What the fuck?

5995
06:37:10,180 --> 06:37:12,320
Oh my god, it's hidden underneath here.

5996
06:37:13,720 --> 06:37:14,720
Clever dread.

5997
06:37:18,840 --> 06:37:20,540
And then the next one is here.

5998
06:37:26,440 --> 06:37:26,880
Oh hey!

5999
06:37:27,640 --> 06:37:28,100
Alright.

6000
06:37:31,200 --> 06:37:32,500
And then we go up.

6001
06:37:36,590 --> 06:37:37,990
That's right, you can't catch me.

6002
06:37:39,070 --> 06:37:39,590
That's right.

6003
06:37:42,270 --> 06:37:42,690
Yay!

6004
06:37:44,130 --> 06:37:46,650
Oh, dude, yeah, I'm Osmosis-Jonesing right now.

6005
06:37:48,290 --> 06:37:50,350
Oh, damn, will the world be safe from the blot?

6006
06:37:51,730 --> 06:37:52,010
Yay!

6007
06:37:52,290 --> 06:37:52,790
My heart!

6008
06:37:58,210 --> 06:38:00,050
Greetings, fellow blots.

6009
06:38:00,490 --> 06:38:03,630
Have you heard of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and let him into your hearts?

6010
06:38:03,850 --> 06:38:04,130
Ha-ha!

6011
06:38:06,830 --> 06:38:08,310
Okay, I'll go this way.

6012
06:38:08,970 --> 06:38:11,070
I hope those guys exploded out of friendship.

6013
06:38:11,530 --> 06:38:13,270
Because that would be very awkward if they didn't.

6014
06:38:20,920 --> 06:38:21,640
All right.

6015
06:38:22,820 --> 06:38:23,500
Down I go.

6016
06:38:25,960 --> 06:38:26,940
Open up.

6017
06:38:27,160 --> 06:38:27,460
Yay!

6018
06:38:29,400 --> 06:38:30,280
Oh, shit.

6019
06:38:31,840 --> 06:38:34,440
Just one more, and I can see it's a weak point right there.

6020
06:38:34,680 --> 06:38:35,420
Oh, shit!

6021
06:38:38,160 --> 06:38:39,120
Oh, my God.

6022
06:38:39,260 --> 06:38:39,780
Where did he?

6023
06:38:39,920 --> 06:38:42,380
He just spawns in it behind me.

6024
06:38:42,940 --> 06:38:44,340
What the fuck is going?

6025
06:38:48,600 --> 06:38:50,860
He literally just spawns it.

6026
06:38:51,020 --> 06:38:53,000
It spawns in behind you.

6027
06:38:58,080 --> 06:38:58,480
Okay.

6028
06:38:59,580 --> 06:39:00,460
That should be fine.

6029
06:39:01,260 --> 06:39:03,180
He just spawns it.

6030
06:39:07,790 --> 06:39:08,230
Alright.

6031
06:39:08,610 --> 06:39:09,230
Very slowly.

6032
06:39:09,450 --> 06:39:10,090
I gotta wait.

6033
06:39:13,640 --> 06:39:17,680
This sucks because he's closing his mouth because of the other guys with me.

6034
06:39:18,820 --> 06:39:20,600
So I have to actually fucking wait.

6035
06:39:22,040 --> 06:39:24,540
Please just open your mouth longer!

6036
06:39:25,780 --> 06:39:27,220
Please stop slapping!

6037
06:39:28,560 --> 06:39:29,820
Please, sir!

6038
06:39:33,460 --> 06:39:36,220
I need you to stop slapping!

6039
06:39:37,580 --> 06:39:39,960
Oh my god, a fucking curse, a fucking curse.

6040
06:39:40,180 --> 06:39:46,340
You have to, you line up like that perfect the perfect angle to fuck me over.

6041
06:39:46,580 --> 06:39:47,660
A fucking curse you did.

6042
06:39:51,300 --> 06:39:53,120
Oh my god, they can't, they don't stop.

6043
06:39:54,040 --> 06:39:54,380
Okay.

6044
06:39:57,960 --> 06:39:59,040
Okay, there There we go.

6045
06:39:59,500 --> 06:39:59,760
There we go.

6046
06:39:59,820 --> 06:40:00,580
Now we're okay.

6047
06:40:01,700 --> 06:40:02,420
Holy shit.

6048
06:40:02,540 --> 06:40:03,440
How many are there?

6049
06:40:04,400 --> 06:40:05,520
How many are there?

6050
06:40:07,520 --> 06:40:08,560
Wait, he died.

6051
06:40:10,340 --> 06:40:11,760
Wait, he fucking died.

6052
06:40:14,120 --> 06:40:14,940
Oh no, he's over there.

6053
06:40:20,630 --> 06:40:22,650
Alright, just a few more left.

6054
06:40:24,050 --> 06:40:25,150
Where's the last one?

6055
06:40:26,190 --> 06:40:26,570
Hello?

6056
06:40:26,690 --> 06:40:27,870
Oh, it's in this corner.

6057
06:40:28,150 --> 06:40:29,410
Oh, that's diabolical.

6058
06:40:31,750 --> 06:40:32,270
Right?

6059
06:40:32,290 --> 06:40:33,130
in that corner.

6060
06:40:36,390 --> 06:40:37,350
Last shot.

6061
06:40:38,450 --> 06:40:39,110
Oh, shit!

6062
06:40:39,310 --> 06:40:39,630
I'm sorry!

6063
06:40:40,870 --> 06:40:42,450
It was a love tap.

6064
06:40:44,350 --> 06:40:44,830
Yay!

6065
06:40:49,160 --> 06:40:51,240
I got an epic journey achievement!

6066
06:40:51,380 --> 06:40:52,080
Is that good?

6067
06:40:52,520 --> 06:40:53,420
That's good, Enre?

6068
06:41:09,640 --> 06:41:10,860
Come on, Oswald.

6069
06:41:12,280 --> 06:41:14,320
Kill your girlfriend if you don't give my heart back.

6070
06:41:20,700 --> 06:41:23,660
Nothing can stop me.

6071
06:41:28,600 --> 06:41:28,740
Yay!

6072
06:41:33,490 --> 06:41:37,250
All I have to do is just push the statue and it's gone.

6073
06:41:40,830 --> 06:41:43,470
Don't make me push it.

6074
06:41:46,590 --> 06:41:46,850
Yay!

6075
06:41:47,350 --> 06:41:48,570
Power fireworks!

6076
06:41:49,710 --> 06:41:51,010
Friendship explosion.

6077
06:41:56,890 --> 06:41:59,010
Here you go, friend.

6078
06:41:59,750 --> 06:42:01,890
Getting my hot bag.

6079
06:42:02,370 --> 06:42:06,070
The intruder returned to my lab, but not in the way I expected.

6080
06:42:07,410 --> 06:42:16,850
After retrieving my brush, I peered down into the world I had created and noticed something had changed.

6081
06:42:17,030 --> 06:42:17,730
Oh, it's Oswood.

6082
06:42:18,150 --> 06:42:21,010
The wasteland no longer needed my magic.

6083
06:42:25,070 --> 06:42:30,990
Oh, thanks to the efforts of my apprentice it had developed some magic.

6084
06:42:32,270 --> 06:42:38,470
Yeah Magic born of courage And wise choices.

6085
06:42:38,530 --> 06:42:40,710
I did it good ending.

6086
06:42:40,910 --> 06:42:56,330
Oh my god, see I tried so hard to be good and I did it I fucking did it Bum bum bum I actually am a Good person, guys.

6087
06:43:03,490 --> 06:43:05,190
That didn't break?

6088
06:43:10,940 --> 06:43:11,800
Wait, that's all?

6089
06:43:13,840 --> 06:43:16,060
We could have just painted her back?

6090
06:43:16,800 --> 06:43:17,420
That's...

6091
06:43:17,420 --> 06:43:17,730
That's...

6092
06:43:18,280 --> 06:43:18,900
That's the Oswald.

6093
06:43:19,080 --> 06:43:20,620
You're such a fucking idiot.

6094
06:43:23,060 --> 06:43:26,700
Feeling enemies never affected the ending, by the way.

6095
06:43:26,940 --> 06:43:29,800
Kina, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

6096
06:43:31,360 --> 06:43:32,740
I have to do?

6097
06:43:35,580 --> 06:43:37,440
He's banished.

6098
06:43:44,060 --> 06:43:45,260
Yay!

6099
06:43:46,940 --> 06:43:48,940
They're happy now.

6100
06:43:49,800 --> 06:43:51,500
The way is defeated or redeemed.

6101
06:43:54,900 --> 06:43:57,000
The ways in which we treat others.

6102
06:44:02,720 --> 06:44:13,700
and perhaps most important the friendships oh yes on the mysteries he saw oh there's goofy

6103
06:44:38,510 --> 06:44:50,050
yeah he's got some oh my look this is his girlfriend that's right and perhaps more perhaps even brothers

6104
06:44:56,600 --> 06:44:58,860
he's like you want to watch

6105
06:45:02,800 --> 06:45:05,960
that's my girlfriend you want to watch

6106
06:45:11,700 --> 06:45:21,460

Thank you.

6110
06:45:25,280 --> 06:45:27,020
The power of friendship.

6111
06:45:27,240 --> 06:45:28,760
Oh my god, we did it.

6112
06:45:29,300 --> 06:45:29,960
What in it?

6113
06:45:29,960 --> 06:45:30,960
Oh my, I haven't had it.

6114
06:45:31,060 --> 06:45:35,900
I haven't done a non-Marvel Rival as Endurance Stream in a long fucking time.

6115
06:45:36,420 --> 06:45:36,800
Oh my.

6116
06:45:36,920 --> 06:45:43,300
It did not feel like I was playing for seven hours, but I was losing steam at the last hour.

6117
06:45:43,540 --> 06:45:44,160
I'm not.

6118
06:45:47,080 --> 06:45:49,480
I think it did help that I kept getting stuck.

6119
06:45:49,500 --> 06:47:03,740

Thank you.

6124
06:47:28,160 --> 06:47:31,320
Toki, to make it a real endurance stream, replay the game for the...

6125
06:47:31,320 --> 06:47:34,400
No, the bad ending is actually really crazy.

6126
06:47:34,900 --> 06:47:37,280
Like, Mickey literally just destroys the whole village.

6127
06:47:37,680 --> 06:47:39,300
I don't remember, like, the reason...

6128
06:47:39,300 --> 06:47:39,760
I don't know.

6129
06:47:39,880 --> 06:47:41,160
There's no reason for him.

6130
06:47:41,600 --> 06:47:43,540
I mean, it's Mickey Mouse that...

6131
06:47:43,540 --> 06:47:45,040
Is there really a reason?

6132
06:47:45,520 --> 06:47:46,260
I mean...

6133
06:47:49,500 --> 06:47:52,380
basically like a reflection of current Disney.

6134
06:47:53,140 --> 06:47:55,700
Uh, Nephirs, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

6135
06:47:56,400 --> 06:47:59,440
Um, but yeah, is there an after after credit scene, guys?

6136
06:48:03,180 --> 06:48:06,320
Yeah, he just has a, he literally becomes Disney, yeah.

6137
06:48:07,120 --> 06:48:08,440
Is Epic Mickey 2 that bad?

6138
06:48:10,740 --> 06:48:13,140
I never, I never played Epic Mickey.

6139
06:48:13,240 --> 06:48:14,960
I mean, I never played Epic Mickey in general.

6140
06:48:15,760 --> 06:48:17,860
Um, Vinny, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

6141
06:48:18,080 --> 06:48:18,820

6144
06:48:53,280 --> 06:48:53,440
too.

6145
06:48:53,900 --> 06:48:58,140
And it was a game that I've been wanting to play for a while now.

6146
06:48:58,380 --> 06:49:01,600
So I'm glad to add another game in my completed list.

6147
06:49:01,860 --> 06:49:02,740
I'm always...

6148
06:49:03,500 --> 06:49:05,500
I always want to complete, like...

6149
06:49:05,500 --> 06:49:07,320
I like completing games.

6150
06:49:07,600 --> 06:49:09,560
Yeah, they missed out on the fun facts, guys.

6151
06:49:12,220 --> 06:49:16,120
All the fun facts and fun stories.

6152
06:49:17,180 --> 06:49:19,140
And they missed out on data updates.

6153
06:49:20,980 --> 06:49:26,700
I always, I always slip in the most crucial data updates on these type of streams.

6154
06:49:26,920 --> 06:49:29,640
So you can't, you shouldn't, don't miss out.

6155
06:49:32,240 --> 06:49:33,860
You sound so tired.

6156
06:49:34,000 --> 06:49:34,500
I am.

6157
06:49:34,680 --> 06:49:37,680
I mean, I streamed for seven hours today.

6158
06:49:38,860 --> 06:49:40,460
My schedule is so fucked.

6159
06:49:40,580 --> 06:49:48,540
I think it's because it's like both jet lag and like, I've had like so much stuff to do because I've been trying to catch up on things.

6160
06:49:51,660 --> 06:50:23,380
uh incredible like my sleep schedule is just all over the place i also had a 4 a.m rehearse like tech rehearsal for um the fake trigger gamescom thing today too so um i took a nap woke up at 1 a.m had to stay up till 4 a.m to do the rehearsal the tech rehearsal and then like um went back to sleep um and woke up at like what like 12 ish i think 12 p.m um yeah that's why i posted my at three in the fucking morning.

6161
06:50:26,200 --> 06:50:29,960
But yeah, for those who don't know, I'll be streaming the fake trigger thing.

6162
06:50:30,920 --> 06:50:35,080
But like, we're going to be broadcast also in Germany.

6163
06:50:35,700 --> 06:50:40,680
So like, we're playing with people who are at the fake trigger games con booth.

6164
06:50:41,360 --> 06:50:44,120
And like, you know how like I have my chat up on my top right.

6165
06:50:44,440 --> 06:50:47,200
So whatever you, like, they'll be able to see the stream.

6166
06:50:47,280 --> 06:50:48,860
Like, they'll be able to see the stream and stuff.

6167
06:50:49,140 --> 06:50:50,960
Which is funny because like, I'm fighting the...

6168
06:50:50,980 --> 06:52:29,740
people at the games con booth so like what's stopping them from like stream sniping me like like now that i think about it like they can just stream snip me because i literally be on the screen while they like they can just look at like because like the like the the stream of me playing the game is literally in front of them like in front of all the people that will be playing the game so so they'll just look up and then see exactly where I am it's it's the challenge now I was like I was like wait a minute now that I think about it wait oh yeah yeah um oh yeah i have to play on eu ping too um so um so i mean we'll have it's me and rpr rpr is apparently like at the um at the venue playing and then we're gonna grab two people that gets assigned to us for a squad so like i don't know i'll just be the heel bot again it's not even 120 it's like it's like 150 or some shit because i'm west coast so it's um i'm west coast so i get more ping to eu than um than um uh asia yeah he'll it's okay

6169
06:52:29,740 --> 06:52:37,940
all i have to do is just press q that's it that's really fun i really enjoyed Epic Mickey.

6170
06:52:38,340 --> 06:52:45,060
Tomorrow is the Sloppy Sisters collab with Lamo, Mint, and Snuffy.

6171
06:52:45,520 --> 06:52:49,420
So we're going to be playing Majorina and then yeah, at least I get to sleep.

6172
06:52:49,540 --> 06:52:50,400
Oh, I can't sleep in.

6173
06:52:50,460 --> 06:52:52,700
Now that Dad's back, I can't sleep in anymore.

6174
06:52:53,040 --> 06:52:56,300
Which, by the way, I gotta feed Dad later.

6175
06:52:56,580 --> 06:52:57,880
Because he needs to eat food.

6176
06:52:58,240 --> 06:53:00,040
He hasn't been like...

6177
06:53:00,040 --> 06:53:03,000
He hasn't been demanding food, which is nice.

6178
06:53:03,140 --> 06:53:04,780
I think it's because like...

6179
06:53:04,780 --> 06:53:42,960
I think because he's like a chonky boy now he doesn't get as hungry um because he has so much you know he has so much fat on him now so he doesn't get as hungry easily i don't know how it works actually maybe that's not how it works but he hasn't barked at me for food today which is nice because usually in the before before he was at the dog sitter um yeah he's finally i don't know if that's how it works i don't have a medical degree um I got my meta degree revoked after Battlefield 6 for some reason.

6180
06:53:43,080 --> 06:53:44,860
I don't know why I saved lives.

6181
06:53:49,280 --> 06:53:58,300
Yeah, he has fat reserves, so maybe that's why he's not as demanding for food lately.

6182
06:53:58,640 --> 06:54:00,800
I don't know how I lost my medical license.

6183
06:54:01,000 --> 06:54:02,680
I saved so many lives there.

6184
06:54:08,480 --> 06:54:10,760
I know I was a hero

6185
06:54:15,420 --> 06:55:08,840
It says combat medic I was just trying to Make sure I was both a medic and a combat And in combat by the way Literally the TF2 medic Holy shit A lot of people worked on this I love the artwork though The artwork's really pretty I wish I bought the I think like I I wish I bought the Epic Mickey art books I love art books though I love like seeing all the concept art of stuff um wasn't this game wasn't the game company for this from Hong Kong right I don't know maybe I'm making shit up I don't remember but it was either like Hong Kong or somewhere else in China.
