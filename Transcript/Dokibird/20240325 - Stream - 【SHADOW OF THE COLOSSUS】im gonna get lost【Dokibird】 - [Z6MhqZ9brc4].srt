00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,600
Hello everybody!

2
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,080
Hello guys!

3
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,440
I'm so excited.

4
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,760
I know this is like a super rare Sunday stream.

5
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:06,500
I figured since, you know, I took an extra rest day yesterday, I was like, ah, fuck it, let's do it.

6
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,340
Let's do a Sunday stream.

7
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,380
It's very rare.

8
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,400
It's very rare of me to do a Sunday stream.

9
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,940
But like, I took like an extra rest day last week.

10
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,320
So I'm just like, you know what?

11
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,760
Let's spoil the dragoons a little bit today.

12
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:27,280
You might be noticing lately that like, I've been posting schedules a lot earlier than I used to in the past.

13
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:39,780
If you are, if you're a new fan, in the past, sometimes I will post my schedules on like Tuesday or like Monday or something.

14
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,920
But lately, yes, I've been posting my schedules a lot.

15
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:49,980
That is because it is a lot easier to figure out what to play now.

16
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,800
I don't really have to wait on anything.

17
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:02,400
So other than like collabs, I guess collabs is like the only thing that I have to actually like wait for, for confirmation.

18
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:09,360
But usually I ask about collabs for like really early on before like the week is over.

19
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,980
So like I would know what the collabs are for next week, stuff like that.

20
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,440
Because I already do have like some stuff, some collabs planned for next week.

21
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,260
Like things like that.

22
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,940
Like I try to plan early for collabs.

23
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,400
So that's why I've been posting my schedules a lot earlier than usual.

24
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,740
I hope I will be able to keep that up.

25
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,080
Mui, thank you for the super chat.

26
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,840
Thank you, thank you.

27
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,580
Hey Doki, can I get a birthday wish for my birthday today?

28
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,560
Happy birthday!

29
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,900
Happy birthday to you.

30
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,620
Happy birthday to you.

31
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,280
Happy birthday dear Mui.

32
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,060
Happy birthday to you.

33
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,620
Yeah!

34
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,560
Happy birthday!

35
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,300
Yay!

36
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,340
But yeah, anyway.

37
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,320
Shadow of Colossus.

38
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,800
This is actually a game that I've been meaning to play for a very, very, very, very, very, very long time.

39
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,260
I sort of know what this game is about.

40
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:06,720
Because my very first time watching this playthrough was years, years, years, years, years ago on the Game Grumps.

41
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,540
Oh my gosh.

42
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,280
If I ever get a collab with the Game Grumps, it would be a fucking dream come true.

43
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,900
Anyway...

44
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,880
Is that... Egoraptor?

45
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,800
Anyway, I don't think he likes being called Egoraptor anymore.

46
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,180
I think Aaron wants to be called Aaron.

47
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,120
But like, anyway, anyway.

48
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,180
I've actually... that was like the first time I've watched...

49
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,780
Bro, you know he's like... I...

50
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,220
Okay, you know he's like...

51
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,600
Okay, I feel like saying this would be like, yeah, I'm not gonna collab with this bitch.

52
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,540
You know, Aaron is like 37 now.

53
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,120
Oh my god, I feel old now knowing that!

54
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,460
Aaron is like, he's almost 40!

55
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,660
I was like, what?

56
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,580
No, they're supposed to be like in their 20s forever!

57
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:07,960
Forever!

58
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,860
I can't believe it.

59
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,340
Time.

60
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,940
Shut up!

61
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,740
Shut up!

62
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,200
Shut up!

63
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,660
Shut up!

64
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,140
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

65
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,180
He's almost 40!

66
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,040
He's almost 40!

67
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,760
Oh my god!

68
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,280
I always feel like Game Grumps is always in their 20s forever.

69
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,840
They'll be in their 20s forever!

70
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,740
But he's... it just blew my mind.

71
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,540
It actually blew my mind that he's 37 now.

72
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,980
Stop talking!

73
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,720
Shut up!

74
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,120
Shut up!

75
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,940
Stop talking!

76
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,800
Shut up!

77
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,320
Shut up!

78
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,460
Anyway.

79
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,260
Anyway.

80
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:01,000
But yes, the very first time I've ever watched this playthrough was via Game Grumps.

81
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,060
And it seemed like a game that I've always really wanted to play.

82
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
And I've always actually played...

83
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,760
I'm trying to remember the developer of Shadow of the Colossus.

84
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,780
Who are the developers of Shadow of the Colossus?

85
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,980
I talked about... I told this story before.

86
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,120
Oh, Team Ico?

87
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,060
Or ICO?

88
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,440
I don't know if it's ICO or ICO.

89
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:30,640
But basically, the only game I've ever played from them was the one regarding the Shadow people.

90
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,940
God, what was that game called?

91
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,420
I didn't... I was so young when I played that game.

92
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,800
Because I always saw it.

93
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,020
Saw like demos of it.

94
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,140
You could play the demo of it.

95
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,780
And then I was like, oh my god, dad, buy this game for me.

96
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,220
This... there's... the demo looks so fucking cool.

97
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,200
And then I bought the game.

98
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,180
And then... oh, it's the same.

99
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,440
It is also ICO.

100
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:51,900
Okay.

101
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,240
It's also... it's also ICO.

102
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,120
Okay.

103
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:57,900
Anyway.

104
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,740
And then the thing is, I was a really stupid kid.

105
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,660
And I'm a very stupid adult too.

106
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,680
So like, you know, at least it's like...

107
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,380
At least I'm consistent.

108
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,980
You know, at least... at least I'm consistent in terms of like how this goes.

109
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,660
But basically, as a kid, I was really fucking stupid.

110
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,280
Never... didn't change at all.

111
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,600
Anyway, but... I tried to play it.

112
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,120
I bought the game and I tried to play it.

113
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,840
I had no idea what the fuck I was doing.

114
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,200
Because these games, there's no actual instructions.

115
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,260
It's all about using like... context clues and being intuitive.

116
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,100
But like, I didn't have that as a kid.

117
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,840
I still don't have that as an adult.

118
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,440
I think I was just born wrong.

119
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,480
But...

120
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,800
But like, I didn't know what the fuck to do.

121
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,620
Because all I could remember was just running around and slapping people with a wooden sword.

122
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,500
And I didn't know what to do.

123
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,760
I was so fucking frustrated.

124
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,240
I spent hours trying to...

125
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,400
Like, when I bought the game, I spent like hours...

126
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,700
Like, trying to play the game.

127
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,000
Trying to figure out what to do.

128
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,820
And I was just running around as this little kid.

129
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,040
Fucking whacking shadow people with a wooden sword.

130
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,640
And I was so fucking frustrated.

131
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,480
I was like, why do I have a wooden sword?

132
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,420
Where are the real weapons?

133
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,000
Where's the princess?

134
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,320
And then I stopped after that.

135
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,480
I literally played a couple of hours one day.

136
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,780
And then I never touched the game again.

137
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,360
I... I never touched the game again after that.

138
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,300
And that was my only experience playing their games.

139
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,880
And I never played any other games that they made.

140
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,820
Oh no!

141
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,720
That's a lie.

142
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
I played the Guardian.

143
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,780
It... it was also like when it came out.

144
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,160
It was a beautiful game.

145
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,340
But like... I think I... I also played for one day.

146
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,660
I played for one day.

147
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,220
Because I think I got stuck in an area.

148
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,580
Because like I said, these games...

149
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,980
They're... it's all about being able to figure stuff out yourself.

150
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,740
And then... so like I must have been stuck somewhere.

151
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,460
Because I got so fucking frustrated that I stopped playing after one day.

152
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,380
So... I am consistent throughout this.

153
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,780
And because of this...

154
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,180
But I saw... you know... I saw other game girls playing it.

155
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,260
And it seemed really fun.

156
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,040
So I was like, you know what?

157
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,080
Maybe this time it will be different.

158
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,120
Because this time I have chat to yell at me.

159
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,360
If I get lost.

160
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,580
Because I know for this game...

161
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,980
This game... the hour play through is really depends on like...

162
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,380
How many...

163
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,160
It really depends on where you know what to do.

164
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,400
Like where you have to go type deal.

165
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,160
Because if you know where to go...

166
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,720
This game is like 2 to 3 hours.

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,160
Because you're just going to destination, destination, destination.

168
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,240
If you don't know where to go... like me...

169
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,680
It can be a very long game.

170
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,940
So it really depends on like...

171
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,180
How this is going to go.

172
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,660
If I'm going to find...

173
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,520
The Colossus and shit like that.

174
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:14,500
If I'm going to find the big scary monsters that I have to kill.

175
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,520
Because it's all about trying to find the big scary monsters.

176
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,480
I have no idea... like obviously people...

177
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,540
I think the internet... yeah forums existed.

178
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,580
But like I'm pretty sure this game had a fucking game guide.

179
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,660
I am so 100% sure.

180
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,520
There has to be a game guide for this.

181
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,420
Because like...

182
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,680
How the fuck were people able to figure out where to go?

183
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,780
Like how... how the fuck were people able to figure this out?

184
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,460
Oh yeah and the lizards!

185
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,580
Oh I forgot about the lizards!

186
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,280
Apparently I have to fucking beat up some lizards too!

187
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,520
Oh my god for like extra health or something?

188
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,020
I don't know.

189
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,560
I don't remember.

190
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,420
I don't remember from the...

191
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,060
All my... all the knowledge I have is just from...

192
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,640
Like just sort of from...

193
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,340
Remembering from never on game grounds.

194
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,520
Yeah.

195
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,360
Anyway.

196
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,780
Oh to upgrade my stamina!

197
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,360
Yeah!

198
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:05,780
Fuck!

199
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,360
Okay this is gonna be...

200
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
This is gonna be interesting.

201
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,920
I hope you guys don't hate me too much for...

202
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,740
Ruining this game for you guys.

203
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,420
I hope...

204
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,280
I hope you guys don't hate me that much.

205
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,800
Also is my sound guy here today?

206
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,940
Oh photo mode.

207
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,580
Hell yeah.

208
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,840
Let's do photo mode.

209
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,320
Cinematic mode.

210
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,400
Performance mode.

211
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,620
No.

212
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,300
Midnight mode.

213
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:29,880
I don't know.

214
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,940
We'll just do that.

215
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,700
That seems fine.

216
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,200
I don't know if my sound guy is alive right now.

217
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,460
Let me double check.

218
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,460
He is!

219
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,240
Sound guy!

220
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,820
Okay don't worry sound guy.

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,540
He's here.

222
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,580
He typed to...

223
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,320
Sound guy!

224
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,380
You have a...

225
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,920
A YouTube account!

226
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,420
Use that!

227
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,320
Let me know you're here via YouTube.

228
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,380
Rock thank you for the super chat.

229
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:54,680
Thank you.

230
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,060
Thank you.

231
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,840
Getting lost.

232
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,760
Wanting back sync.

233
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,480
What I'm hearing is Doki needs other weapons.

234
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:58,600
I'm gonna go get some weapons.

235
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,120
Sound is in her life.

236
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,100
The game that tracks back seekers.

237
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,220
Thank you super chat.

238
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:02,640
Thank you.

239
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,630
I just...

240
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,820
Okay until only one...

241
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,240
Wait...

242
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,120
Where is the other one?

243
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,840
I don't even see the other.

244
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,780
There's another one?

245
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,760
I don't know.

246
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,060
I don't even see the other sigil...

247
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,340
By the way guys I still...

248
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:26,180
I still haven't upgraded my monitor so like my monitor is still the shitty one.

249
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,140
I might get a upgrade.

250
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,780
Upgrade soon.

251
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,360
And thank you for the five gift ships!

252
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,220
Thank you, thank you!

253
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,220
Alright.

254
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,440
I don't know if the name sounds gonna be...

255
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,460
I'm gonna boost it up a little bit.

256
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,680
There we go.

257
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:48,950
That should be good.

258
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,410
Right?

259
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,270
Bird!

260
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,090
Also, if I'm looking to the right a lot, it's because that's where chat is.

261
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:55,790
That's really it.

262
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,710
I'm just looking at chat.

263
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,510
LOL

264
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,790
Lore time!

265
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,170
Yeah, there's no like actual dialogue in this game.

266
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,570
That's me!

267
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,330
Smile.

268
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,010
And that's our horse.

269
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,410
I can't wait...

270
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,430
to kill only one boss in this game.

271
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,270
I bet you I'm gonna spend like...

272
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,750
half of this... 90% of stream just trying to find one guy.

273
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:43,070
LOL LOL Okay, you can bring it up more?

274
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:43,510
Okay.

275
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,030
Alright, let me know if that's better.

276
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,110
Ooh!

277
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,370
It's like the re- It's the PS4 version, so I'm pretty sure this is like the remake.

278
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,790
It's like... a little bit better.

279
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,410
Bum-ba-dum!

280
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,230
Alright!

281
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,350
Is the sound better?

282
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,330
Sound guy!

283
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:02,890
Bum-bum!

284
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,990
The soundtrack's beautiful though, I have to admit.

285
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,830
The soundtrack's really, really nice.

286
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:11,210
The soundtrack's really, really nice.

287
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:11,570
It's worse?

288
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,390
How can it be worse?

289
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,610
It's the PS4!

290
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,350
Normal size.

291
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,110
Thank you for the super chat.

292
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,630
Thank you, thank you.

293
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,050
Don't be too hard on yourself, Doki.

294
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,010
I managed to find three bosses.

295
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,270
How can it be wor- There's 16 bosses?!

296
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,470
Okay, I did not realize there are 16 bosses in this game.

297
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:43,610
I don't know how the fuck I ha- I was able to watch 16 bosses.

298
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,690
That's me!

299
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,940
Yeah, the soundtrack is pretty amazing.

300
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,240
I heard that you're planning on releasing a new console soon.

301
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,620
For like, this year and ne- next year?

302
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,060
Maybe?

303
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,320
You're a nerd.

304
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,500
Shake my head!

305
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,480
Thank you for the super chat- What did I do?!

306
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,240
Moon, thank you for the first super chat to call me a nerd!

307
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,660
What the fuck did I do?!

308
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,790
You see, to be a nerd, you have to be smart.

309
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,160
There's no way the graphics are worse than the original PS2.

310
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,340
There's no fucking way.

311
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:53,140
You guys all have like fucking nostalgia glasses on if you think- If you think the original had better graphics.

312
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,660
There's no fucking way.

313
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:03,660
The PS2 graphics- It's like, going back, you're like, oh yeah, that was the best fucking game I've ever played back in the PS2 era.

314
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,140
And you- You replay it now and you're like...

315
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,580
There was just nothing better to do.

316
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,480
Alright, settings.

317
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,800
Audio.

318
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,400
Look, the PS2 was great!

319
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,180
I would admit, I love the PS2.

320
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,140
But you have to admit that there's a lot of nostalgia factor going into the PS2.

321
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,380
Okay, nice.

322
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:31,860
Show tutorial.

323
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,980
That's what I need.

324
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,260
Uhhhh...

325
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,980
It controls... audio...

326
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,200
I think that's good, right?

327
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:40,940
Yeah.

328
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,580
We should be good now.

329
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,130
No- Of course there's no motion blur.

330
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,390
But what would the hard version be?

331
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,850
They'll be harder to find?

332
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:56,810
Like,

333
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,010
what's the hard version gonna be?

334
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,990
Will they be like harder to find?

335
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:04,990
Why?

336
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,830
How do you make this harder?

337
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:14,530
Oh yeah, instead of like in this open area, you gotta go to like all the way to the end of the map.

338
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,590
And then you're gonna find this one stone.

339
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:26,330
And you have to make sure you hit that one stone to be able to- To be- To be able to get there.

340
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,970
And then the boss will show up.

341
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,690
But then, when the boss shows up, that's not when you engage the fight.

342
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,110
Because after that, you have to find the third stone.

343
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,410
That's like on the other side of the map.

344
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,110
And then you hit that third stone.

345
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,370
And then you go back to the second stone.

346
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,950
And then he'll show- And then he'll show up.

347
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,390
That is the hard mode.

348
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,910
And like someone was like, you just get less stamina.

349
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,690
Oh, okay.

350
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,270
Someone was like, Doki.

351
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,210
You just get less stamina.

352
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,200
Well, I'm gonna find my princess.

353
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,590
The hard version, it's more cutscenes because you find out their backstory.

354
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,490
And then you take emotional damage on top of it.

355
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,550
Here's my dead princess.

356
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,680
God, the soundtrack is actually beautiful though.

357
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,380
It's actually- She's half dead?

358
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:15,460
I like think like- Who's feeding this woman while I'm like, you know, trying to find the bosses.

359
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,420
Sorry, video game logic.

360
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:28,300
I'm like so spo- Not spoiled, but I'm so corrupted by video game realism in the current times.

361
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,480
Because everything has to be super duper fucking realistic now when it comes to video games.

362
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,020
So now I'm wondering, what the fuck is like- It's like she's in a coma, right?

363
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,800
So when you're in a coma, you have to- You have to like make sure they don't get bed sores.

364
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,480
Which is basically if the skin has too much pressure, it starts like breaking apart.

365
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,540
And I'm gonna be gone for a long time.

366
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:01,380
Who's gonna bathe her and feed her and make sure she's like turned around.

367
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,080
Oh, she's actually dead dead.

368
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:20,200
Yeah, her blood was born and she's like, I am a monster.

369
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,220
I can't even move my head.

370
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,240
I'm a monster.

371
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,260
I'm so, so exhausted.

372
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,520
But I'm a bad monster.

373
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,380
I'm a bad monster.

374
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,420
I'm a god.

375
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:41,560
I'm a god, too.

376
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:41,620
I'm a god.

377
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,400
I wonder if that's a real language.

378
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,000
Or if they were just like, just go wild, man.

379
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,940
Well, the Sims language is an actual language.

380
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,660
I've shown it before, but the Sims is an actual real language.

381
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,040
I'm just wondering if they... when they told the voice actor to like read this...

382
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,080
if they were like, just fucking go wild, man.

383
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,540
I don't know.

384
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,560
I don't know.

385
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,220
Yeah, it is.

386
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,920
If you like... there's like...

387
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,520
It's called Simlish.

388
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,580
Simlish or something?

389
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,120
And then there's like actual songs.

390
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,760
Wait, you guys don't know about Simlish?

391
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,540
Okay, after I kill these shadow people, I need you guys to listen to Simlish.

392
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,600
It's actually crazy.

393
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,600
Because like, they've had like real songs.

394
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,600
They've had real... I don't... okay, I might get demonetized.

395
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,520
But like...

396
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,900
They've had real songs translated into Simlish.

397
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,500
And they got like the actual rights off of it.

398
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,580
It's the best language.

399
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,220
Okay.

400
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,400
I'll show you guys after the gameplay.

401
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,420
I'll show you in the Super Chat reading.

402
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,620

Alright.

407
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,920
Alright, princess.

408
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,520
Apparently you're actually dead dead.

409
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,420
And you're not in a coma.

410
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,560
I got one guide because somebody was like, oh no, she's like...

411
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,640
Nah, she's half dead.

412
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,900
And this is why you are a nerd.

413
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,700
Shake my head.

00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,970

00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,510
Where I put my jacket?

433
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,230
That's expensive.

434
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,530
Look, Dormin, people die every day.

435
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,830
What makes her special?

436
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,830
There's so much fish in the sea, Dormin.

437
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,570
Why is she special?

438
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:49,250
Is it because she's a princess and you want to inherit her throne?

439
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,890
She is real to me.

440
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,630

Go forth!

529
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,880
Back up your... back up the trunk!

530
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,760
Right here.

531
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:44,920
Good.

532
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,180
Good job.

533
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,960
Holy shit.

534
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,680
I've never struggled so hard riding a horse.

535
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,180
Please!

536
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,760

Please!

538
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,160
Why does it tilt up?

539
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,740
I'm trying!

540
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,860
Oh!

541
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,760
Okay it's this way.

542
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,540
This is the way.

543
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,760
Please stop calling the horse Argo.

544
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,980
What is his name?

545
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,540
He's Argo now.

546
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,900
My favorite horse.

547
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:20,700
Argo.

548
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,760
Alright.

549
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,240
This way.

550
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,940
This way has to be it.

551
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,180
There's no other way.

552
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,320
Argo!

553
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:29,920
See?

554
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:30,960
Agro!

555
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,660
Oh!

556
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,040
I think Argo is a better name.

557
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,800
What did I do it?

558
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,080
Is this one of them?

559
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,060
Hello?

560
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,400
Is this the first Colossus?

561
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,280
Please.

562
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,380
Okay.

563
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,220
It's up right?

564
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:54,940
It's up.

565
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,380
Okay.

566
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,240
Please not.

567
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,220
Argo!

568
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,760
Alright.

569
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,020
We're gonna go...

570
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,480
climb.

571
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,640
How do I climb?

572
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,580
While holding R2 use L to climb.

573
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,780
Okay.

574
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,640
Wait.

575
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,980
Grab on the places.

576
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,340
But where can I grab?

577
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,280
I'm grabbing!

578
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,740
Okay.

579
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,220
Oh my god.

580
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:20,700
Can I?

581
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,740
Okay.

582
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,780
Wait I can fix the camera.

583
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:24,480
I...

584
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,640
Wait.

585
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:28,820
Wait.

586
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,540
There's filters?

587
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,620
Oh my god.

588
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,700
Oh my god.

589
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,620
I can make this look less sad.

590
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,200
Wait.

591
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:38,740
What?

592
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,240
There's filters in this game?

593
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,420
Wait.

594
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:43,960
This is great.

595
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,000
I can actually make this game look less sad.

596
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,420
Oh my god.

597
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,400
There's Sepia.

598
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,140
Oh my god.

599
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,340
Make it...

600
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:57,920
Okay.

601
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,280
Wait.

602
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,440
We should make it like warmer.

603
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,060
Make it less sad.

604
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:02,760
Wait.

605
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,400
There's like...

606
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:04,420
complimentary.

607
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,300
Okay.

608
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,020
What's the difference between...

609
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,560
compliment... warm...

610
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,860
compliment... Oh my god.

611
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,000
This makes it like less sad.

612
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:15,860
Okay.

613
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,640
We're gonna do... We'll do warm.

614
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,420
Like as if the sun is still up.

615
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,500
And then we'll have...

616
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,740
There's death appeal.

617
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,820
There is death appeal.

618
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,820
What the f...

619
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,440
What does this look like?

620
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,740
Oh my god.

621
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:29,940
Wait.

622
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:30,620
Sorry.

623
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,420
Sorry guys.

624
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,200
I'm sorry.

625
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,460
This is like...

626
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,240
I'm sorry.

627
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,400
I'm sorry for distracting you guys with this.

628
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,380
Alright.

629
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:42,840
Here we go.

630
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,060
Now I should be able to climb, right?

631
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,260
Climb.

632
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,620
Why can't I climb?

633
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:47,900
Climb!

634
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,620
For the love of god!

635
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:52,800
Climb!

636
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:54,320
Two!

637
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,300
Okay.

638
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,080
Okay.

639
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,460
There we go.

640
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:57,800
Okay.

641
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:57,980
Oh!

642
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:58,900
Bushes!

643
00:32:59,580 --> 00:32:59,940
Alright.

644
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,420
It's the bushes.

645
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,180
I figured it out.

646
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,540
How do I get up though?

647
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,300
Do I... Do I go like...

648
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:10,640
here?

649
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,360
Oh!

650
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,160
I have to go this way.

651
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,240
Okay.

652
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,640
It's okay.

653
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,940
I still have a lot of stamina.

654
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,240
Come on.

655
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,060
Climb up.

656
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,240
Climb up.

657
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:19,720
That's it.

658
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,100
That's right.

659
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:20,860
Come on.

660
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,760
Come on!

661
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,660
Get up!

662
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,640
Get up!

663
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,900
Oh my god!

664
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,920
Why are you so stupid?

665
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:33,920
Okay.

666
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,340
Don't worry.

667
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,500
We got this.

668
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,760
Here we go.

669
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,940
Now go.

670
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,540
Go.

671
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
Oh thank god.

672
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,240
Okay.

673
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,160
Come on.

674
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,460
Why did you jump?

675
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,000
Just get up!

676
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,220
Get up!

677
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,180
Oh my god.

678
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:52,420
Okay.

679
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:52,860
There we go.

680
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,720
Guys.

681
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,160
I'm figuring this out.

682
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:56,680
Okay.

683
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,940
I'm figuring this out.

684
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,420
We're learning.

685
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,880
We're learning here.

686
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,080
Alright.

687
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,500
Nice.

688
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,780
And then...

689
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,380
Climb.

690
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,660
Yes.

691
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,880
Alright.

692
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,320
Nice.

693
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:09,640
Okay.

694
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,480
Alright.

695
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,840
Doki is like slowly conquering journalist mode.

696
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,020
Don't worry.

697
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,240
I'll be the... Oh!

698
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,180
Dive roll?

699
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:18,620
Oh!

700
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,200
I didn't realize there was a hole there.

701
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,320
Alright.

702
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,900
This is your second job as a journalist.

703
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:25,660
No.

704
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,480
I figured it out.

705
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,400
I figured it out.

706
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,920
This is... Now you know why I quit eco so fast.

707
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,980
Now you know.

708
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,560
Now you know.

709
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,740
You know why I quit.

710
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,860
Wait.

711
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,840
Is there like a way to get up?

712
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,160
Oh.

713
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:43,640
Oh!

714
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:44,900
Okay.

715
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,520
Grab.

716
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,320
Wait.

717
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:46,560
No.

718
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,220
Not grab this.

719
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,120
Is it this one?

720
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,520
No.

721
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
There's like...

722
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,040
Something I can grab.

723
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,320
Right?

724
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,680
Oh shit.

725
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,300
There has to be something I can grab here.

726
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,300
Alright.

727
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,360
Or maybe I have to grab it from here.

728
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,480
Right?

729
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,120
What do I grab?

730
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,060
Oh!

731
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,500
Please!

732
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,380
Grab the something!

733
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,800
Oh god.

734
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,140
Alright.

735
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,220
We're gonna figure this out.

736
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,140
You must be able to grab some...

737
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,440
The camera is showing you.

738
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,280
What?

739
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,580
This?

740
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,720
What do I have to grab?

741
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,860
What's the camera trying to show me?

742
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,600
Where's my...

743
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,080
Where's my yellow paint?

744
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,480
Oh!

745
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,640
I can grab to the left!

746
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,000
Oh!

747
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,320
I'm learning!

748
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,800
Guys, I'm getting better!

749
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,820
My brain is actually leveling up!

750
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,260
I can't wait to go to graduate kindergarten!

751
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,300
You're the first!

752
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,100
You're the reason why games have yellow paint!

753
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,440
I am the consumer!

754
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,400
I am the regular dormi player base!

755
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,460
Okay?

756
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,800
I am the consumer!

757
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,080
Okay.

758
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,920
Hold R2 to focus on the colossus.

759
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,400
Okay.

760
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,660
How do I use my weapon?

761
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,720
How do I use it though?

762
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,720
Oh, I can call my horse here.

763
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,140
Okay, I'm focused.

764
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,360
Hello, it's me.

765
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,560
I'm friend.

766
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,260
Friend?

767
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:29,960
Friend?

768
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,300
Friend?

769
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,080
Friend!

770
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,460
Oh shit!

771
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:37,840
Sorry!

772
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,800
Oh shit!

773
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,120
Sorry!

774
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,680
Wrong weapon!

775
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,140
Oh friend!

776
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,840
Okay.

777
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:44,880
Friend!

778
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,420
Where's your weak spot friend?

779
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,460
Friend!

780
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,120
Where is it?

781
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,480
Where is it?

782
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,860
Where's your weak spot?

783
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,940
Oh wait, I have to bring down...

784
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,140
Oh god, where's the settings?

785
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,480
I have to bring down the music just a little bit apparently.

786
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,660
Okay.

787
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,640
Alright, let me know that's better sound guy.

788
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,100
Okay.

789
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,600
Friend!

790
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,340
Where's your weak spot?

791
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,960
Where the fuck is it?

792
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,620
Oh, it's head!

793
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,860
Okay, don't worry friend.

794
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,800
I'm gonna climb on top of you.

795
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,480
And then I'm gonna give you a nice little surgery.

796
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,680
Don't worry.

797
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,680
Friend.

798
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,780
Hold press the ring, press the stab again.

799
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,080
Okay.

800
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,980
Can I stab this?

801
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,460
Friend!

802
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,660
Oh shit!

803
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,180
Don't worry!

804
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,700
I'm like a little bug scratcher!

805
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,400
I'm just gonna give you like a little help.

806
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:47,880
Woah!

807
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,020
God, please.

808
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,740
Just let me do a little poke.

809
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,480
Yeah!

810
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,000
Just a little poke!

811
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,300
Come on!

812
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,040
Yeah!

813
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,500
It's gonna be okay!

814
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,420
Friend stab!

815
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,940
Good friends will stab.

816
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,740
Bro, you have like a pimple trying to pop your pimple!

817
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,040
Okay, here we go.

818
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:23,760
It's okay.

819
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,740
Don't worry.

820
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,700
Friend's here.

821
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,900
Friend is here.

822
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,820
Sorry, I need to aim.

823
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,600
Friend needs to aim a little bit better.

824
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,280
Here we go.

825
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:32,920
Boop!

826
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,560
Boop!

827
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,760
Boop!

828
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,160
Do you like that little back scratch?

829
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,340
See?

830
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,240
He liked it!

831
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,520
Climb.

832
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,560
Okay.

833
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,700
Oh god, I have to climb so far.

834
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:51,920
Climb!

835
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,680
No!

836
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,220
God!

837
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,160
Okay.

838
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,440
Climb here.

839
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,180
Climb here.

840
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,000
Okay, we're okay.

841
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,860
We just need to recharge our stab.

842
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,360
No!

843
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,080
What the fuck?

844
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,180
Bro.

845
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,580
We're like the most annoying...

846
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,140
We have to be like the most annoying mosquito ever.

847
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,140
Like annoying flea or some shit.

848
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,060
Okay, we're good.

849
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,300
Friend, climb.

850
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,520
Climb.

851
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,380
It's okay.

852
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,680
It's okay.

853
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,580
Don't worry, Friend.

854
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,080
I'm gonna help you.

855
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,440
I'm gonna help you.

856
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,780
Friend, don't worry.

857
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,140
You have a bug issue.

858
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,440
You have a bug issue.

859
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,780
Don't worry, Friend.

860
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,540
Oh, Friend.

861
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,440
Oh, Friend.

862
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:39,820
Please.

863
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:40,840
Please.

864
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:41,860
Please.

865
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,760
Please.

866
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,320
Oh, fuck!

867
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:45,840
Okay.

868
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,160
Oh god.

869
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,320
Okay, how the fuck do I stay?

870
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,120
AHHHHHH!

871
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,120
STAB!

872
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:53,780
STAB!

873
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,500
Friend stab!

874
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,040
There you go.

875
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,240
We're okay.

876
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,360
That's okay.

877
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:00,960
He likes it.

878
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,320
It's like a little poke... a little head pat.

879
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,460
Guys, it's just a little head pat.

880
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,560
Nothing to worry about.

881
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,220
See?

882
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,020
He likes it.

883
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,640
We're like best friends now.

884
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,820
We're like best friends.

885
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,260
Hahahaha!

886
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,560
Hahaha!

887
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,760
Hahaha!

888
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,240
Oh, I have to fucking hold it!

889
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,720
To stab longer!

890
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,240
Oh, no!

891
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:28,800
No!

892
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,720
Okay, okay.

893
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,020
It's fine.

894
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:31,480
It's fine.

895
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,560
I just realized what I was doing wrong.

896
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,260
Hahaha!

897
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,620
I was just doing little...

898
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,460
Hahaha!

899
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:38,940
Hahaha!

900
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,440
Oh, no!

901
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,340
Nooooo!

902
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,220
Oh, no!

903
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,000
Guys...

904
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,560
Guys...

905
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,180
I realized I had to...

906
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,640
I had to like... recharge my stamina.

907
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,580
I had to like...

908
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:54,580
recharge my stamina.

909
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,360
For a little bit.

910
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,460
Sorry.

911
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,600
Look!

912
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,940
It's like my first job!

913
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,040
I'm like shadowing right now.

914
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:02,960
Stab!

915
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,460
Stab!

916
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:08,340
Stab!

917
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,380
I did it!

918
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,720
Alright, I figured it out.

919
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,340
Guys...

920
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,280
I'm not annoying anymore.

921
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,340
I'm just... I'm actually...

922
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,700
I'm actually trouble this time.

923
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,490
I'm not annoying this time.

924
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,870
I'm actually like...

925
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,430
a problem.

926
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,690
Because I figured out how to...

927
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,630
I figured out...

928
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,890
how to actually hurt him.

929
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:43,990
Alright, here we go.

930
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,510
At first, I was just like, you know...

931
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,550
a little bug bite.

932
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,490
You know, just a little tiny bug bite.

933
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,890
And now I'm like... I'm like a real problem.

934
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:52,930
Hahaha!

935
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:57,410
Boom!

936
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,210
There we go!

937
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,670
Don't worry.

938
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:01,610
It's like...

939
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,830
It's like just some therapy.

940
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,030
Some brain therapy.

941
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,170
Right here.

942
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:07,510
Look at that!

943
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,570
We're getting rid of all the...

944
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,190
toxic juices in your brain!

945
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,570
Have you seen that?

946
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,850
Where like they do this like...

947
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,070
fucking thing where they actually...

948
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,810
try to gush out liquid from your head?

949
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,650
Yeah, I'm just doing some acupuncture.

950
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,280
Yeah, the oil drill!

951
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,200
Yeah,

952
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:32,460
the oil drill!

953
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:32,580
Yeah, the oil drill!

954
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,680
This is the oil drill!

955
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,490
I saw like...

956
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,130
It's okay.

957
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:42,150
Don't worry.

958
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,010
I purified you.

959
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:49,630
See?

960
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,450
All better now.

961
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,340
Yay!

962
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,060
We did it!

963
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,600
We got the first pause!

964
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,320
That's so easy!

965
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:10,860
That's so easy!

966
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,390
Was that him?

967
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,750
He's a happy customer.

968
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,650
He came back to...

969
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,810
wish me a well... good job.

970
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,760
No, it's like a happy customer!

971
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:41,440
It's like...

972
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,160
Good job, Doki!

973
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,820
I was so stressed out and now I feel...

974
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,140
relieved.

975
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,220
He's leaving a Google review!

976
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:51,720
He's leaving a Google review!

977
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,460
That's my Google review right there.

978
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,900
Yeah, it must be a good thing...

979
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,820
you're doing because of all the...

980
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,600
black spirits.

981
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,100
It's like oil!

982
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,880
That's why it's black.

983
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:12,750
Look at that.

984
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,690
He was so happy.

985
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:16,950
He was so happy.

986
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,090
He like...

987
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,170
gave me more space.

988
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:22,890
That's the tip.

989
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,940
That's my next vo.

990
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,840
I can move the camera!

991
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,660
Oh, it's the water!

992
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,000
That's like a house upgrade.

993
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,220
You know like in Animal Crossing?

994
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,920
Where your house gets bigger?

995
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,960
Now I have more space to put my...

996
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,840
storage cabinet.

997
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:56,810
Nice.

998
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:58,370
Argo, are you back?

999
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,410
Guys, I figured out how to play the game.

1000
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:02,730
Alright.

1001
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:05,550
Our next step is to find the fucking salamander.

1002
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,170
Argo!

1003
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,290
You came back!

1004
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:11,770
I need to figure out how to ride this horse.

1005
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:13,250
Okay.

1006
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,710
I think this is like the hardest part of the game.

1007
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:16,590
Oh my god.

1008
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:21,230
This is actually...

1009
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,930
This is actually the hardest part.

1010
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,380
I should have found an altar similar to this one.

1011
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,400
I should have found an altar similar to this one.

1012
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,340
Wait, I'm injured?

1013
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,120
What do you mean?

1014
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,180
I thought there was no fall...

1015
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,960
There's fall damage in this game?

1016
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,920
What hurt me?

1017
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,900
There's no way.

1018
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,120
Am I actually injured?

1019
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,980
I can't tell.

1020
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,280
There's no bars or anything.

1021
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,460
Hello.

1022
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,640
Did I save?

1023
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,660
Oh, it's a save station.

1024
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,100
Hello.

1025
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:04,660
Save.

1026
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,040
I think...

1027
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,120
I think I saved?

1028
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,820
I can't tell.

1029
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,960
Oh, I have the...

1030
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,620
prey?

1031
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:18,760
Oh shit.

1032
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,400
Okay, sorry.

1033
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,480
There we go.

1034
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,580
Save.

1035
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:23,840
Oh, I have the...

1036
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,640
save.

1037
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,180
Prey to save.

1038
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,040
Here we go.

1039
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:27,720
I figured it out.

1040
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,040
Prey to save.

1041
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,180
Nice.

1042
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,060
Alright.

1043
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,240
Alright, Argo.

1044
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,340
Let's go.

1045
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,440
Where do we go?

1046
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,100
Where is the sword taking me?

1047
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,600
Where is it this time?

1048
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,460
Below?

1049
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,560
Why is it pointing that way?

1050
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,940
How do I go below?

1051
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:49,700
How do I go below?

1052
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:49,880
What?

1053
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:49,980
What?

1054
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:55,880
Okay.

1055
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,460
Little me would never play this game.

1056
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,120
That's for sure.

1057
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,000
Thank god I have chat.

1058
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,700
Okay, this way.

1059
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,680
Wait, what?

1060
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,440
It has to be like...

1061
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,020
behind, right?

1062
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:11,500
Oh my god.

1063
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,340
Argo, please.

1064
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:13,920
Please.

1065
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,000
Alright.

1066
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,400
We gotta figure this out.

1067
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,080
Argo, please!

1068
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,860
I keep pressing X.

1069
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,800
He likes to ride the horse.

1070
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,360
But it's triangle.

1071
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,340
Alright.

1072
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,940
It's like somewhere around here.

1073
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:29,760
Oh!

1074
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,060
Is it behind the temple?

1075
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,040
It must be.

1076
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:35,720
Yeah.

1077
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,720
It's somewhere behind here.

1078
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:38,340
Okay.

1079
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:39,420
Camera.

1080
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,940
Camera, work with me.

1081
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,300
Please.

1082
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,300
Please work with me.

1083
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,480
Okay.

1084
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,120
It has to be like...

1085
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,340
behind here.

1086
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,200
Behind here?

1087
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,860
Because why would it take me here?

1088
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,920
I have to climb the temple.

1089
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,260
Okay.

1090
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,100
Let's see.

1091
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,400
Sword.

1092
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,560
Sword.

1093
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,540
Where do I go, sword?

1094
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,680
Where do I go?

1095
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,640
Sword!

1096
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,360
Tell me!

1097
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,540
Where shall I go?

1098
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:18,840
Where shall I go?

1099
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,500
Where's the sun?

1100
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,440
Okay.

1101
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,100
There's the sun.

1102
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,240
Alright.

1103
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,380
Sword, guide me.

1104
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,340
Guide me, sword.

1105
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,280
Sword, you must know.

1106
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,280
Below?

1107
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,640
How the fuck do I go below?

1108
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,160
It's a cave somewhere.

1109
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,060
GPS!

1110
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,200
Oh!

1111
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:43,940
Down here!

1112
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,880
Will I die?

1113
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,860
Well, time to find out.

1114
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:48,380
Go!

1115
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:50,140
Go!

1116
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:53,900
If you...

1117
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,900
I'm not afraid.

1118
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:56,820
I'm not...

1119
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,280
What are you afraid of?

1120
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,300
It's Wadi!

1121
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:01,820
Yeah!

1122
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,400
Hey, I think I'm dead.

1123
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:10,900
Wait, am I...

1124
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,360
Am I...

1125
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,020
I'm dead!

1126
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:15,640
I'm dead!

1127
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,680
Guys, I think...

1128
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,060
I'm dead!

1129
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,180
I like...

1130
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:25,500
Okay.

1131
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,240
I like that...

1132
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,640
I like...

1133
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,240
It's not... It's not even a splash!

1134
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:34,400
It's not...

1135
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:34,400
It's not even a splash!

1136
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,260
There's like...

1137
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,900
There's... Like, I don't even sink down!

1138
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,000
It... It's...

1139
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,660
It's just like... I just...

1140
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,700
No way...

1141
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,800
Oh my god!

1142
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,020
Oh my god!

1143
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,600
Like, he doesn't even sink!

1144
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,320
That's the crazy part!

1145
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,020
He just fucking...

1146
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,360
He just fucking...

1147
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,080
It was like concrete!

1148
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,440
That is so realistic, not gonna lie.

1149
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,680
It has to be like the most realistic water... water physics ever.

1150
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,620
Just like real life.

1151
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,160
I don't know.

1152
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,900
Usually, you know, it's like Minecraft.

1153
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,320
When you drop down, like, you don't die from the water.

1154
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,400
I thought it'd be like Minecraft, where you can stop the fall.

1155
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,620
I realized it was not like Minecraft.

1156
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,980
I realized...

1157
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,000
I...

1158
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:36,320
Today, I realized it was not like Minecraft.

1159
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,340
Heh heh heh heh heh heh...

1160
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,360
Heh heh heh heh heh...

1161
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,620
Okay, how do we get down then?

1162
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,120
We have to figure out how to get down.

1163
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:47,840
We have to figure out how to get down.

1164
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,420
Because the cave is down there.

1165
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:49,780
Because the cave is down there.

1166
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,940
Like, it's still water!

1167
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,740
It can't be that bad!

1168
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,340
No bucket tech.

1169
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,520
No bucket tech.

1170
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,180
Where's the bucket tech here?

1171
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,860
How the fuck do we get down there?

1172
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,840
There's a bridge?

1173
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,220
Oh, there is a bridge.

1174
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,600
How do I get to the bridge?

1175
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,220
How did I get to the bridge last time?

1176
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,080
There has to be like another bridge here.

1177
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,520
This one, right?

1178
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,320
Yeah, this bridge.

1179
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:23,860
Okay.

1180
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,460
Yeah, I know I could climb down.

1181
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,880
But like...

1182
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,660
That's not fun.

1183
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,720
Heh heh heh heh heh heh...

1184
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,980
Heh heh heh heh heh...

1185
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:41,560
It's not as fun as falling... It's like the biggest dive board.

1186
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,480
You know?

1187
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,100
It's like the biggest fucking diving board.

1188
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,680
I mean, the Olympians can do it.

1189
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,300
Why can't I?

1190
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,180
You know?

1191
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,220
I mean, did you see...

1192
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:54,380
Whoa!

1193
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:57,900
Oh shit.

1194
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:58,800
Where is that?

1195
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,400
I mean, did you not see me climb the fucking Colossus?

1196
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,420
Let R go dive.

1197
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,760
Oh, it's down there.

1198
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,420
Okay.

1199
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,500
What?

1200
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,380
Did I ever jump down?

1201
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,200
Heh heh heh heh heh heh...

1202
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,700
Heh heh heh heh heh...

1203
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,060
Heh heh heh heh heh...

1204
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,980
So many questions.

1205
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,140
I wanna know how...

1206
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,280
How many ways can I die?

1207
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,120
Jump, Argo.

1208
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:30,540
Jump.

1209
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,200
Alright.

1210
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:32,840
Yeah.

1211
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,260
Come on, Argo.

1212
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,640
We need to be a little faster.

1213
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,480
There's no fast travel in this game.

1214
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,340
Alright.

1215
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:43,620
Don't...

1216
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,100
Don't keep... please.

1217
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,040
I haven't found a single salamander yet.

1218
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,600
Or like, stamina.

1219
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,560
They must be like so fucking tiny, cause I don't know where they are.

1220
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,960
Okay, where's my sword?

1221
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,120
Oh, there's no sun.

1222
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,540
This is bad.

1223
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,360
I'm gonna go with intuition.

1224
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,480
And it's like somewhere here.

1225
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:14,800
I swear, there was like side... like there was like a boom boom boom here, right?

1226
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:19,680
Whoa.

1227
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,400
There he is.

1228
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,900
He seems friendly.

1229
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,540
Look, another customer!

1230
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,400
The first colossus must have left a really good review.

1231
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:38,840
I already have a second customer.

1232
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,180
Don't worry, sir.

1233
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,320
I'm ready to give you some acupuncture.

1234
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:43,580
Alright.

1235
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,800
There's no sun, so I don't know where your weak point is.

1236
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,400
Sun!

1237
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,100
What the fuck is that?

1238
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,240
Okay.

1239
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:51,580
Friend.

1240
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,100
Where is this?

1241
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,640
Okay, it's the head.

1242
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,200
Who would've thought it's the head again?

1243
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,880
Don't worry, Argyle.

1244
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,780
Everything will be fine.

1245
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,320
Wait, I think like it's like his toe.

1246
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:06,600
Right?

1247
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,860
His toe hurt.

1248
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,420
Okay, let go of your toe so I can chew your toe.

1249
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,320
Oh, unlucky.

1250
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,860
Okay, maybe I'll use that bow.

1251
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,120
Don't worry, I'm gonna shoot your toe.

1252
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,840
Nine out of ten doctors recommend it.

1253
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,800
How do I use this?

1254
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:31,180
Okay.

1255
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,280
Shoot toe.

1256
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:33,980
Alright.

1257
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,440
Lift up your toe.

1258
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:36,940
Lift it up.

1259
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,820
Wait, how do I shoot this?

1260
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,560
Am I...

1261
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,600
Am I stupid?

1262
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,320
Oh, I just let go.

1263
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:47,220
Okay, let go.

1264
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:47,340
Oh, I just let go.

1265
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:47,340
Okay, let go.

1266
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,120
Yeah!

1267
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:49,860
Come on!

1268
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:54,470
Come on!

1269
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:55,250
Lift up your...

1270
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,290
There we go.

1271
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:57,630
Come on, lift it up!

1272
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:00,070
Lift it up!

1273
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:01,390
Lift it up!

1274
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:02,350
Stop lifting up this one!

1275
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:02,770
Yeah.

1276
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,470
Am I hitting it?

1277
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:08,310
I don't even know.

1278
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:09,650
Alright, lift it up again.

1279
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:11,290
Okay, don't worry.

1280
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,090
Slow and steady, we'll figure this out.

1281
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,930
Oh, there you go!

1282
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:16,330
See?

1283
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:17,590
We did it!

1284
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:18,890
Nice.

1285
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:20,330
Alright.

1286
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,210
Nice.

1287
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:22,430
Okay.

1288
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:24,450
How do I climb up?

1289
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:26,270
Alright.

1290
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:27,390
Next second step.

1291
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:30,270
Second step.

1292
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:32,090
Oh!

1293
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:32,670
Here!

1294
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:33,330
Here, here!

1295
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:35,370
Here, here!

1296
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:37,690
Put away!

1297
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:38,330
Put it away!

1298
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:39,690
There we go.

1299
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,290
Alright, it took me a while.

1300
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:43,050
Alright, nice.

1301
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:44,090
We figured it out.

1302
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:46,110
Oh god, camera.

1303
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,510
Oh god, camera!

1304
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:51,610
Don't worry, sir!

1305
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:56,290
I have a 100% success rate!

1306
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:01,410
You'll be a new person by the time I'm done with you!

1307
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:03,410
Don't worry!

1308
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:05,830
People loved it!

1309
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,090
We're gonna get rid of all that stress, sir!

1310
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:13,730
Welcome to the Doki Massage Parlor!

1311
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:15,450
Alright.

1312
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,050
Can we do acupuncture and massage par- Oh!

1313
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:19,450
Sir!

1314
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:21,270
Sir!

1315
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:24,990
I know this is your first time, but I come highly recommended!

1316
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:28,050
Do not worry!

1317
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:31,430
Stop!

1318
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:36,170
Don't worry!

1319
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:36,890
Do not worry!

1320
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:37,910
This is normal!

1321
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:41,430
This is a normal amount of oil to drip out!

1322
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,750
Hahaha!

1323
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:43,150
Hahaha!

1324
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:46,950
Very normal amount!

1325
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:50,290
Hahaha!

1326
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:51,070
Hahaha!

1327
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:53,710
Your headache is gonna be gone!

1328
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:54,470
I swear!

1329
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,630
I swear, sir!

1330
00:56:58,110 --> 00:56:58,910
I swear, sir!

1331
00:56:58,910 --> 00:56:59,230
Don't worry!

1332
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:01,610
It's a hu- I would never lie to you!

1333
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:02,310
Hahaha!

1334
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:06,790
Getting that pore out!

1335
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:07,290
You know?

1336
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:09,390
Gotta clean those pores!

1337
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:11,550
Wait, it's not glowing anymore.

1338
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:12,470
Huh?

1339
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:14,430
The fuck?

1340
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:16,010
You're stressed out in more than one area?

1341
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:17,370
Hahaha!

1342
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,480
Sir, where else are you stressed?

1343
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,600
I hate the target.

1344
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,840
What the fu- Oh shit!

1345
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:31,920
Hahaha!

1346
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,360
Oh, I can't just drop down.

1347
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,220
Sir, we need to find out where your second pore is.

1348
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,400
You gotta let go, man!

1349
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,840
You gotta take some breaks!

1350
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:46,360
You're not- Unless you're a workaholic, then that's fine.

1351
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,300
Is it your- your nips down there?

1352
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,000
Is your nips down there...

1353
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,660
hurty?

1354
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,400
Hahaha!

1355
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:54,260
Hahaha!

1356
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,740
Okay, we need to figure it out.

1357
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,420
Where else is he hurty?

1358
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,240
Where else?

1359
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:03,280
Oh, god!

1360
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:04,380
Oh shit!

1361
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,040
Okay, okay!

1362
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,780
Where is it?

1363
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:09,740
Is it his butt?

1364
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,100
Oh, it's his butt!

1365
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,720
Oh, sir, don't worry!

1366
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:14,660
Don't be embarrassed.

1367
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,500
Sometimes, instead of the head, the stress can go to the ass.

1368
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,140
And it's not like the flattering type, too.

1369
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,840
So like, do not worry.

1370
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,360
You are not the only one.

1371
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,420
Don't be embarrassed.

1372
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,160
You're not the first- You might be my second client!

1373
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:34,140
So, this- You are the first client that I have that's stressed out on the ass.

1374
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:34,980
So...

1375
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:35,560
Sorry.

1376
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:36,460
Hahaha!

1377
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:37,500
Hahaha!

1378
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,400
Hahaha!

1379
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,940
Actually, you are my first- You are my second client.

1380
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:49,500
So, in reality, you are my first client to be stressed out down there.

1381
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,460
So... But don't be embarrassed!

1382
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:57,360
I'm pretty sure many other- I will have many other clients that will be stressed out as well.

1383
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,880
Do not worry.

1384
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,920
I shall relieve you of the oil down there.

1385
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,200
Where the fuck is it?

1386
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,240
Hahaha!

1387
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,420
Oh, there it is!

1388
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:10,740
Okay.

1389
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,520
There you go.

1390
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,080
There you go.

1391
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,480
Woooo!

1392
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,000
Stop!

1393
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,000
Hahaha!

1394
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:22,940
It's okay!

1395
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:23,360
It's okay!

1396
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,720
Your figure will not change!

1397
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,400
Kind- Kind Colossus!

1398
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,960
Do not worry!

1399
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:31,680
Oh!

1400
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:32,960
Please stop moving!

1401
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:38,100
What- Stop moving or I'm gonna get the good parts of your ass!

1402
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,040
There you go.

1403
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:40,380
Alright.

1404
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,780
One more hit.

1405
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,860
And then... Boop!

1406
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,260
Hahaha!

1407
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,480
Hahaha!

1408
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,860
You're welcome!

1409
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,500
Please make sure to leave a Yelp review and a Google review.

1410
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:00,300
Yay!

1411
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,820
Another happy customer!

1412
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:05,060
Let's go, Argo!

1413
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,240
Why can't I run?

1414
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:08,440
Hahaha!

1415
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,100
Shit!

1416
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,040
I'm just running!

1417
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,000
Hahaha!

1418
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,160
Now he's so relaxed!

1419
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,080
Look at him!

1420
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,620
He's like lying on the ground!

1421
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:18,760
So relaxed!

1422
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,460
Hahaha!

1423
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:21,500
Hahaha!

1424
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,700
He's free now!

1425
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,920
Now, 100% success rate!

1426
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:38,800
Alright.

1427
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:43,420
Bring music back up and bring sound effects down just a little bit.

1428
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:43,720
Oops!

1429
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:44,500
I just saw that.

1430
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,700
That was something.

1431
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,080
I said 20 minutes ago.

1432
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:47,940
Hahaha!

1433
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:52,580
Yay!

1434
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,200
Another happy customer!

1435
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,460
0 out of 5.

1436
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,160
Too much booty play!

1437
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,940
Thank you for the super chat!

1438
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:05,380
Thank you!

1439
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:14,990
What is this?

1440
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,850
The anger of the sleeping giant shatters the earth.

1441
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,290
I'll make you cry.

1442
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:22,310
Why are you so stressed out?

1443
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,420
Yeah, it's just like...

1444
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:33,620
Like those famous TikTok clips where they like...

1445
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:39,420
They like poke holes into the head and then like all that oil drops out.

1446
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:41,080
All the stress oil drops out.

1447
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,900
It's just like that.

1448
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:48,180
Okay, we need to boost that up and then turn on sound effects.

1449
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:50,100
Alright, sound guy, let me know if that's okay.

1450
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,020
Oh, this one's fun.

1451
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,940
I'm getting better at the controls.

1452
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,660
See you guys?

1453
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,600
See you guys?

1454
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,460
I've got... I conquered journalist mode.

1455
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,640
Okay, but not the horse mode.

1456
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:04,820
The horse mode is still...

1457
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,320
I'm still having issues with that.

1458
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:07,480
Hahaha!

1459
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:12,260
I'm still having issues with the fucking...

1460
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:12,940
Hahaha!

1461
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,500
The fucking horse.

1462
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,900
Horse is so hard to ride.

1463
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:18,760
Who would have thought?

1464
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,720
Alright, pray time.

1465
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:22,480
Pray.

1466
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,420
Pray to save.

1467
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:31,260
You guys said there's a salamander near the shrines?

1468
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:32,240
Is there one near here?

1469
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:35,840
Is there one near here, guys?

1470
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,360
Okay, where the fuck is my sword telling me to go?

1471
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:39,880
Sword.

1472
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:40,920
Tell me the way.

1473
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:43,020
Up?

1474
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:45,700
Left?

1475
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:46,840
Okay, left.

1476
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:48,620
Not here.

1477
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:49,780
Alright.

1478
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:50,980
Alright.

1479
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,440
We're gonna figure this out.

1480
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:55,220
Alright, let's go.

1481
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:56,820
The third boss.

1482
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,120
We're at a record!

1483
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,680
Guys, we're already at number three.

1484
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:04,200
You know, I had very low expectations for myself.

1485
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:09,820
I honestly thought I would get like one boss throughout this entire run.

1486
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,660
But now... this way.

1487
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:11,880
Okay.

1488
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,360
But now I got two.

1489
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,440
That's already really, really good.

1490
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:15,780
Okay.

1491
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,140
That's really good for us.

1492
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,820
Alright, now we just gotta figure out... Why are there no other people here in this world?

1493
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:28,680
Where am I?

1494
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,120
Where are the people though?

1495
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:34,140
It's gonna be like across, I think.

1496
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,240
Yeah, we've already exceeded expectations.

1497
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:39,760
We've doubled our expectations.

1498
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:44,000
I thought I'm gonna spend like two plus hours trying to find one guy.

1499
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:50,340
In the end, in the end, we struggled with the controls at first, but we're getting better.

1500
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:51,220
And we're...

1501
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:53,020
We own a successful massage parlor.

1502
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,460
Successful massage and acupuncture parlor.

1503
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,500
And skin care.

1504
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,840
We're acupuncture, skin care, massage.

1505
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,180
All at one.

1506
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,400
Nice.

1507
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,540
This way.

1508
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,260
Okay, it's this way.

1509
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:07,660
Wait, what?

1510
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:08,980
Is it underneath again?

1511
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:11,760
Wait, am I in the wrong area?

1512
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:13,360
No, right?

1513
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,700
It says down there.

1514
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:18,600
What?

1515
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:19,380
No.

1516
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,480
Okay, we'll go this way and try to see.

1517
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,980
I have no idea if I'm in the wrong place.

1518
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,320
I feel like...

1519
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,260
What is it called?

1520
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:35,220
Like when you... the oil stuff.

1521
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,260
The oil treatment.

1522
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,520
Is it also called...

1523
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,580
There's no way that's also acupuncture, right?

1524
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:45,060
Like it's actually like hardcore acupuncture.

1525
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,080
Where like...

1526
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:50,040
It's like... they literally drill a hole.

1527
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,380
Is it bloodletting?

1528
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,820
Is it actually bloodletting?

1529
01:04:59,040 --> 01:04:59,840
Oh my god.

1530
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:00,640
Yeah, that's what I do.

1531
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:03,820
I don't have a license for it because like...

1532
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,300
I'm just naturally talented.

1533
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:10,420
And like if you're naturally talented in these things, you don't need a license.

1534
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,360
It's all word of mouth.

1535
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:13,920
You know?

1536
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,380
Okay, where do I go?

1537
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:16,880
It's this way.

1538
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:17,400
Okay.

1539
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:21,680
Wait, what?

1540
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:22,700
Where is it?

1541
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,660
Am I in the wrong way?

1542
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:26,700
Am I lost now?

1543
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:31,620
Okay.

1544
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,540
Oh, it's this way.

1545
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:34,440
Okay, we gotta figure out how to get across.

1546
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:36,600
Okay.

1547
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:37,740
From here.

1548
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,720
This is how you get across.

1549
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,360
Oh yeah!

1550
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,280
We have a map!

1551
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,500
What the fuck is that skull?

1552
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,220
Oh, that's where we killed the Colossus!

1553
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:49,960
We have a map.

1554
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:53,200
We're doing it.

1555
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,600
We figured... Oh wait, is this a shrine?

1556
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,260
This has to be a shrine.

1557
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:57,640
Time to pray.

1558
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,160
Pray to save.

1559
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,060
Pray.

1560
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,180
Boop.

1561
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:05,200
Yay!

1562
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,140
Is there a lizard?

1563
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,460
A salamander?

1564
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,340
What do they look like?

1565
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:14,780
What does salamander...

1566
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:15,700
Wait, is that salamander?

1567
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,500
No, that's just grass.

1568
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,000
What do they look like?

1569
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:20,060
I don't...

1570
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,120
I don't remember what they look like.

1571
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,640
How tiny are they?

1572
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,120
Are they big?

1573
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,880
What do they look like?

1574
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:28,600
Yeah, but like...

1575
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,720
Are they big?

1576
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:30,500
Are they small?

1577
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,120
What...

1578
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,160
What color?

1579
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,420
White tail.

1580
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:35,000
Oh yes.

1581
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:39,640
Yes, the white tail on these white rocks.

1582
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,840
So easy to find.

1583
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:44,420
They can climb?

1584
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,680
Who taught these lizards how to climb?

1585
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:47,880
Okay.

1586
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:48,820
Let's see.

1587
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,240
Alright, I can climb too.

1588
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,120
Little do they know.

1589
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:53,900
I need to figure out.

1590
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,340
Little do they know.

1591
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Oh, I see him!

1592
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,940
Hello buddy, I see you.

1593
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:00,920
Bro, stop!

1594
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,120
Okay, I see him.

1595
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:07,660
Oh no, what can I grasp?

1596
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,260
God damn it.

1597
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:10,940
I need to figure out what I can climb.

1598
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,020
Oh my god, please.

1599
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,900
I don't even know what this guy's name is.

1600
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:20,100
I know my horse name, but not him.

1601
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:20,780
I see him!

1602
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,420
I know what they look like now.

1603
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:25,800
Oh my god.

1604
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,400
Those little fucking pew pew pew sounds.

1605
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,420
How do I climb up?

1606
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:33,440
Oh, there it is.

1607
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:34,620
I see you.

1608
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:36,020
I see you up there.

1609
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,660
Can't escape from me.

1610
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:39,240
I need to find a way to get up there.

1611
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:39,780
I need your stamina.

1612
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:41,900
It's for my business.

1613
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,460
I need to grow a healthy business.

1614
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:46,740
Come on, I see you.

1615
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:47,460
Boop!

1616
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,060
Is that it?

1617
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,300
Oh!

1618
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,760
I thought you were dead!

1619
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,200
Please, come back.

1620
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,460
You always come back second, right?

1621
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:03,580
Wait, what?

1622
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,840
How is that not a hit?

1623
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:08,080
Boop!

1624
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:10,340
Boop!

1625
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:11,540
Are you dead?

1626
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,280
Are you dead dead?

1627
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:14,380
Okay, double tap.

1628
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:15,980
Just to be sure.

1629
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:17,340
There you go.

1630
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,040
Is it stuck in the wall?

1631
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:23,000
I swear, are you stuck in the wall?

1632
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,160
Are you...

1633
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,580
Are you stu-

1634
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:33,150
How do I get...

1635
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,550
How do I get it?

1636
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:36,550
Oh, thank god!

1637
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:37,050
Okay!

1638
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:40,710
I thought he was actually stuck in the wall.

1639
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:41,830
I...

1640
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:44,270
I'm gonna be so fucking sad.

1641
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:46,690
I got it.

1642
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:49,730
Guys, it's okay.

1643
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:51,210
He was not stuck in the wall.

1644
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:55,330
Okay, nice.

1645
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:56,190
We got the stamina.

1646
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:57,890
I should be okay.

1647
01:08:58,690 --> 01:08:59,170
Yay!

1648
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:01,450
I was not okay.

1649
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:02,410
It's okay, pray.

1650
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:03,890
Pray to save.

1651
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:07,250
Nice.

1652
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:07,910
We're fine.

1653
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:10,190
I don't know.

1654
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:12,130
I thought... I thought I would just...

1655
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:15,070
I thought I would just walk over it and...

1656
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:16,370
And like...

1657
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:17,350
And like...

1658
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:20,370
The lizard is... The lizard tail is just gonna disappear.

1659
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:22,570
Like, underneath my feet.

1660
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:23,710
Because I picked it up.

1661
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:26,450
It has to be here.

1662
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:26,930
Oops.

1663
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:29,550
It's nice to know I have unlimited arrows.

1664
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:31,070
It has to be here.

1665
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:34,110
There's like a really weird...

1666
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:36,570
There's like a really weird...

1667
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:37,290
tunnel here.

1668
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:38,990
So where else would the giant be?

1669
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:43,930
Alright, look.

1670
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:45,490
I got spoiled by...

1671
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:45,750
Alright, look.

1672
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:45,750
I got spoiled by...

1673
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:46,990
modern games, okay?

1674
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:49,670
Modern games today...

1675
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:51,730
They fucking feed you from the bottom.

1676
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:53,970
Because they're scared we're gonna hurt ourselves.

1677
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:54,470
Because they're scared we're gonna hurt ourselves.

1678
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:55,190
Which is very true.

1679
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:02,190
Modern games today...

1680
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:03,650
They don't want us to hurt ourselves.

1681
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:05,270
So like...

1682
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:08,090
I'm not used to...

1683
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:09,410
I'm not used to...

1684
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:10,470
having to figure this out myself.

1685
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:12,930
Like, y'all...

1686
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:15,050
Because they're scared!

1687
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:16,310
They're scared if like...

1688
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:18,750
you're frustrated at a game, you won't play anymore.

1689
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:20,490
Because it's too hard.

1690
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,270
Because I've done that as a child.

1691
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:25,130
They're scared.

1692
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:26,710
And it's understandable.

1693
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:30,970
Alright, nice.

1694
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:32,630
This has to be a lake, right?

1695
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,720
Are we there?

1696
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:37,760
Did I fuck up?

1697
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:40,380
Did I go the wrong way?

1698
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,000
Where's the sun?

1699
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:45,640
Where the fuck is the sun?

1700
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,580
Sun, shine on my sword so I know where to go.

1701
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:51,660
Sun!

1702
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:52,640
Okay.

1703
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:53,500
Sun.

1704
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:55,700
Sun.

1705
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:58,700
Alright.

1706
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:01,020
Sun says...

1707
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,600
Where does the sun say?

1708
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:03,980
Where does the sun say?

1709
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:05,300
Where?

1710
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:08,940
Sun, where do I...

1711
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:09,600
Oh, here.

1712
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:10,800
Here!

1713
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,980
Okay, this way.

1714
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:13,460
We're good.

1715
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:16,800
We're good, it's this way.

1716
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:18,800
Okay.

1717
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:21,320
I ran past a lizard?

1718
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,400
Oh no, that's not good.

1719
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:24,740
Was it in the little tiny cavern?

1720
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,260
Was it in here?

1721
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,200
The little tiny cavern here?

1722
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,040
Praise the sun.

1723
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:37,580
Lizard?

1724
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,760
Lizard, where are you?

1725
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,600
I need to eat your tail!

1726
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,460
For stamina!

1727
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,120
Okay.

1728
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:47,980
Don't worry, I can hear.

1729
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:49,140
I can hear his little feet.

1730
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,020
I have my fucking bow.

1731
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,420
Where's your little feet?

1732
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:58,480
Where are you?

1733
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,700
Where are you, lizard?

1734
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:03,300
Please.

1735
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:05,920
I'm gonna eat your tail.

1736
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:07,840
It apparently helps my stamina.

1737
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,580
Oh, is that the lizard?

1738
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:10,740
No, that's just a rock.

1739
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:12,760
Where the fuck is it?

1740
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,140
What?

1741
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,100
Argo, please!

1742
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:19,480
Stop!

1743
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,180
I'm trying to find the lizard!

1744
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:25,240
He's right there.

1745
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,860
No, there, Doki.

1746
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:28,760
He's right there.

1747
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,660
Doki, it's there.

1748
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:33,480
Oh, god.

1749
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:35,360
Boop.

1750
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:36,920
Boop.

1751
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,340
Boop.

1752
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:40,560
Boop.

1753
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,080
Wait, where did he go?

1754
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,700
Where did his body go?

1755
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:47,380
Where did...

1756
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:48,780
Where did his butt...

1757
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,040
Wait.

1758
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,360
Oh, that's the tail!

1759
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:58,220
Is that the tail?

1760
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,920
Is that his body?

1761
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,180
Is that it?

1762
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,460
Oh, thank god.

1763
01:13:07,330 --> 01:13:10,830
Why did he, like, sink into the rock?

1764
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:14,790
It, like, slipped in.

1765
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:25,960
Okay.

1766
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,440
Does that mean there's a white one?

1767
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:31,420
Only shrine lizards?

1768
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,860
Are you kidding me?

1769
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,740
Then what the fuck was the point of eating the normal lizard?

1770
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:36,800
Am I just a freak?

1771
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,100
Can't believe you guys made me go back.

1772
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:48,020
I can't believe you guys made me go back.

1773
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:48,660
I can't believe you guys made me go back.

1774
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:49,060
I can't believe you guys made me go back.

1775
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:49,700
Argo, come over here.

1776
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,880
I can't run properly.

1777
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:53,980
What's wrong with him?

1778
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:54,960
What's...

1779
01:13:56,540 --> 01:14:01,760
Ever since I ate that lizard, I haven't been able to run right, chat.

1780
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:02,720
I...

1781
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,420
I...

1782
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:10,700
It messed me up.

1783
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:11,860
It messed me up.

1784
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:12,760
It messed me up.

1785
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,920
My legs...

1786
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,960
My legs aren't doing so well.

1787
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,100
Argo!

1788
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:21,820
Argo!

1789
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,000
Argo, come on!

1790
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:23,860
Argo!

1791
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:26,060
Argo!

1792
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:27,080
Argo, come on!

1793
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:27,920
Where are you?

1794
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,240
Argo, come on!

1795
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:30,320
Come on!

1796
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:32,060
You're over here.

1797
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,400
I know you're faster than me.

1798
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:34,580
Stop pretending.

1799
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:36,560
Nice.

1800
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,000
Alright.

1801
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,340
We gotta go kill the third colossal.

1802
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:39,760
I mean...

1803
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,940
We gotta go...

1804
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:42,640
to another appointment.

1805
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,700
We got a new client, Argo.

1806
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:48,140
They're mega fucking stressed right now.

1807
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:53,240
I told you having client base via word of mouth was a good idea.

1808
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,300
We don't have to waste money with stupid advertising.

1809
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:00,480
As long as we make one client really, really, really happy...

1810
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,840
we'll never have to advertise our services.

1811
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:05,000
Let's go.

1812
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:06,300
It has to be like...

1813
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:06,960
here.

1814
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,460
Okay.

1815
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:11,500
We're getting better.

1816
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:13,980
This way?

1817
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:15,200
Is there more ways to go?

1818
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,340
Oh, which way?

1819
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,000
Oh no.

1820
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:19,620
Oh...

1821
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:20,920
Wait.

1822
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:21,740
It splits.

1823
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,280
Oh no.

1824
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:24,680
Okay.

1825
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,360
I've always been not so lucky.

1826
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:29,560
So...

1827
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,440
Maybe this way?

1828
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,020
I mean, look!

1829
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:37,760
It's like...

1830
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:38,700
There's like a...

1831
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:39,960
creepy shrine.

1832
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,560
It has to be the right way, right?

1833
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,800
There's like shrines and stuff here.

1834
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:47,980
Is the sun up?

1835
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,240
The sun is up.

1836
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:49,960
Okay.

1837
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,360
Where is it telling me to go?

1838
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:54,880
Backwards.

1839
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,200
Alright.

1840
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,040
I went the wrong way.

1841
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,300
I went the wrong way.

1842
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:00,520
Wait.

1843
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,360
Is there a shrine?

1844
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:04,360
Is there a shrine here?

1845
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,620
Is this like the shrine palace?

1846
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,400
I can't tell.

1847
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:10,660
It's fine.

1848
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:13,860
Is that... Is that a save station?

1849
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:15,360
I can't tell.

1850
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,220
There's so many...

1851
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:18,440
All the rocks look the same.

1852
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:19,500
Wait.

1853
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:20,340
Hahaha.

1854
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:24,180
Alright.

1855
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,200
Pray the save.

1856
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:29,040
Alright.

1857
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,160
It's time to pray.

1858
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:32,760
Boop.

1859
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:34,120
Yay!

1860
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:36,920
Nice.

1861
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,660
Oh, this looks like a really fancy one.

1862
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:41,480
There has to be a salamander here.

1863
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,200
Why do you see you?

1864
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:44,260
I fucking see you.

1865
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:45,740
Okay.

1866
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,460
I fucking see you.

1867
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:47,700
Shh.

1868
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:49,380
Nice.

1869
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:50,720
Here we go.

1870
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:50,800
Here we go.

1871
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,080
Here we go.

1872
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:52,480
No.

1873
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:53,460
There we go.

1874
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:54,260
Yeah.

1875
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:54,860
He has to be dead.

1876
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:56,500
He's definitely dead.

1877
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:57,960
But just to be sure.

1878
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:01,180
Nice.

1879
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:01,720
Alright.

1880
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:02,380
We got another one.

1881
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:04,020
Boop.

1882
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:05,420
More stamina.

1883
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,140
We're getting stronger.

1884
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,100
Our clients are gonna love this.

1885
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:10,880
Wait.

1886
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:11,460
Where's my horse?

1887
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,360
What happens if I...

1888
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:15,500
Oh!

1889
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:16,300
Fuck!

1890
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:17,060
I'm sorry!

1891
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:17,840
I'm so sorry!

1892
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:20,250
You...

1893
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:21,270
You wasn't...

1894
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:21,910
You wasn't...

1895
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:21,970
You wasn't...

1896
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:22,230
You wasn't...

1897
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:22,610
I

1898
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:29,630
just wanted to know if I'll clip through you.

1899
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:33,230
It was a joke!

1900
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:37,650
I would never argue...

1901
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:39,790
You know I would never do that to you.

1902
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:42,290
Alright.

1903
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:43,990
I'm just training him.

1904
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:47,030
Guys, I'm just training my horse.

1905
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,050
He has to learn how to dodge...

1906
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:51,470
Dodge arrows.

1907
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:52,650
Okay.

1908
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:53,350
Save the prey.

1909
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:56,930
Alright.

1910
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:58,110
Argo, come on.

1911
01:17:58,370 --> 01:17:59,030
Come on.

1912
01:17:59,070 --> 01:17:59,570
I know you're hungry.

1913
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:01,770
We're all hungry here.

1914
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:03,590
We gotta save the princess.

1915
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:05,210
Guys!

1916
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:06,610
It's all about like...

1917
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:08,370
Our horses need a train too!

1918
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:08,830
You know?

1919
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:10,310
Like what if arrows shoot him?

1920
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:11,810
He's now more prepared.

1921
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:14,970
Penguin, thank you for the super chat.

1922
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:15,490
Thank you.

1923
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:16,150
Thank you.

1924
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:19,510
He's now more prepared for like warfare.

1925
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:22,190
Okay.

1926
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:24,690
This way.

1927
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:25,310
Okay.

1928
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:25,690
Okay.

1929
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:26,290
Alright, Argo.

1930
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:26,770
Let's go.

1931
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:28,490
This has to be the right way, right?

1932
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:29,150
Oh my god.

1933
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:29,910
That's not the sword.

1934
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:31,530
The fuck is my sword?

1935
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:32,590
No.

1936
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:35,190
This way?

1937
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:40,070
God, this is such a big area.

1938
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:42,010
Maybe here?

1939
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:43,770
Maybe to the right?

1940
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:47,310
Don't worry.

1941
01:18:47,370 --> 01:18:49,530
There's a sun right here that's gonna show me the way.

1942
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:51,730
The sun right here.

1943
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:53,950
Okay.

1944
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:54,290
No.

1945
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:55,150
Argo, please.

1946
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:55,690
Argo, please.

1947
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:59,730
This one patch of sun will tell me where to go.

1948
01:19:02,490 --> 01:19:03,450
This way?

1949
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:05,350
How the fuck do I...

1950
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,130
How do I get there?

1951
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:09,710
Where am I?

1952
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:16,830
How do I get there?

1953
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:21,590
Surely, I'm gonna figure it out.

1954
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:24,490
I'm gonna figure this out, guys.

1955
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:25,330
Claat!

1956
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:26,630
There's no way I can climb this.

1957
01:19:29,170 --> 01:19:30,530
There has to be...

1958
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:32,430
Okay.

1959
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:34,910
Argo, you must know where to go.

1960
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:39,590
There's no way you climb the mountain.

1961
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:41,470
I don't have enough stamina for that.

1962
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:43,590
There's no fucking way.

1963
01:19:44,730 --> 01:19:45,570
Is it here?

1964
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:47,430
Is this water?

1965
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,150
Is this water?

1966
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:53,330
No, this is a desert.

1967
01:19:58,290 --> 01:19:58,930
This is a desert?

1968
01:19:58,930 --> 01:19:59,090
How the fuck do I...

1969
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:04,610
How do I get so lost?

1970
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:08,570
Oh God!

1971
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:11,990
I didn't know...

1972
01:20:11,990 --> 01:20:12,650
What's the fun?

1973
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,680
Is this where the boss is?

1974
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:20,700
Why would there be an open patch of area?

1975
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:26,160
It's the opposite of water.

1976
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:30,400
Water.

1977
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:30,880
Oh no!

1978
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,720
Yellow and blue look the same!

1979
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:38,060
Okay, water might be like... oh there must be water over there.

1980
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:45,240
I think I got it.

1981
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,820
I think I'm on the right patch.

1982
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,880
It's like the biggest beach.

1983
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:49,540
You're right.

1984
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,420
It's like a beach!

1985
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,740
Guys, I think I'm at the beach, chat.

1986
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,940
Eventually the sand will become water.

1987
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,900
That's how beaches work.

1988
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:07,580
That's how beaches work!

1989
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,260
The sand turns into water!

1990
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:18,100
Where else do you think water comes from?

1991
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:21,740
Okay.

1992
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:23,380
I'm almost there!

1993
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:23,700
See?

1994
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,380
It's like somewhere here!

1995
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,600
Where am I?

1996
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:36,980
Okay, as soon as we find the water, we're good.

1997
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:42,960
Don't worry guys.

1998
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,000
Every sand eventually connects to water.

1999
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,660
That's just basic geology.

2000
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:54,820
The stadium, the sun...

2001
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,980
There has to be water somewhere.

2002
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:00,820
There's no way.

2003
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:01,940
Oh god!

2004
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,660
Don't worry, Argo!

2005
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:07,540
Okay, here.

2006
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:12,140
There has to be water somewhere There!

2007
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:12,840
See?!

2008
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:13,360
There's water!

2009
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:16,020
I f***ing knew it!

2010
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,560
I knew it!

2011
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,220
I knew there was water...

2012
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,400
None of you believed me!

2013
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,680
I knew there was water.

2014
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:27,420
See?

2015
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:31,240
Water is like right here!

2016
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:34,460
Look!

2017
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:37,300
There's water down here!

2018
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,080
Look!

2019
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:41,320
See?

2020
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:42,100
Water!

2021
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,160
I told you.

2022
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:46,840
Eventually you reach water.

2023
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,620
Now where do I go?

2024
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:56,160
I ran into a giant circle!

2025
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,980
I told you there was no way to go!

2026
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,800
I actually...

2027
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:08,020
I ran into a huge circle!

2028
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:09,560
Oh my god!

2029
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:11,740
Back into the cavern I go!

2030
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:16,520
Back into this tunnel I go!

2031
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:18,300
Oh my god!

2032
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,600
Surely this is the right way!

2033
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:22,960
Maybe this time... I can't get lost this time.

2034
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:23,740
I'm going one way.

2035
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:27,600
There's no way I can get lost.

2036
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:30,220
This is literally like one direction.

2037
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,040
Oh god!

2038
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:33,100
I'm so sorry!

2039
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:38,040
You have a really stupid person as the writer.

2040
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:42,780
Please!

2041
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:43,960
Please!

2042
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,160
Okay, here we go.

2043
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:46,640
We're good!

2044
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:47,540
We did it!

2045
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:00,920
Eventually we will find the area.

2046
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:03,880
We made it!

2047
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,700
We did it, Arco!

2048
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,740
We fucking did it!

2049
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,220
Can you go in the water?

2050
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,260
Oh my god, you can swim!

2051
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,460
My horse can do anything.

2052
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:16,800
Please.

2053
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:19,080
Go deeper into the water.

2054
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,580
Oh no, is this like a water level?

2055
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,180
Okay guys, I don't think Arco likes the water.

2056
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:27,520
But I... Do I like the water?

2057
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,840
Okay, I'm fine with the water too.

2058
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:32,860
Alright.

2059
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:35,960
I can dive?

2060
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:37,000
Oh, I don't like that.

2061
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:39,780
I do not like that fact that I can swim like this.

2062
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,120
Can I swim faster?

2063
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:44,440
Or I'm gonna be like super fucking slow forever.

2064
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:47,820
Alright.

2065
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:52,930
Watch my stamina.

2066
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:53,810
My stamina is okay.

2067
01:24:55,010 --> 01:24:57,350
I don't know if I can like swim faster.

2068
01:24:59,430 --> 01:25:01,610
Oh, I swim faster if I'm diving?

2069
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:02,330
Okay.

2070
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:03,930
That's good to know.

2071
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:05,110
I don't know what happened.

2072
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:08,250
Ever since I ate that one lizard, I'm super fucking janked up.

2073
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:09,330
Like...

2074
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:14,990
I don't feel so good.

2075
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:20,450
He's super janked up right now.

2076
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:24,230
Where do I go?

2077
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:25,570
Do I just...

2078
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:27,490
In here?

2079
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:32,670
Okay.

2080
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:36,710
Oh shit.

2081
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:37,270
Okay, wait.

2082
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:38,470
I must be able to grab this, right?

2083
01:25:39,170 --> 01:25:39,570
Oh.

2084
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:46,460
Okay, I'm okay.

2085
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:46,860
I'm okay.

2086
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:47,660
Okay.

2087
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,160
I thought I was gonna die.

2088
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,540
And then... cause I don't know how to find this place again.

2089
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,420
I don't...

2090
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:53,580
I don't...

2091
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,140
I'm gonna be like, please.

2092
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:01,800
Do not make me...

2093
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:05,100
I'm just gonna be like, please.

2094
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:11,980
I really don't want to fucking try to find this area again.

2095
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,200
Okay, apparently if I dive down...

2096
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:16,860
If I dive down...

2097
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:19,660
If I dive down...

2098
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:20,560
I'm gonna be like, get there faster.

2099
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:22,000
But it's okay.

2100
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:22,940
I just need to go back up.

2101
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:25,640
Oh god.

2102
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,260
There's no shrine nearby?

2103
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,860
There must be a shrine nearby.

2104
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:30,560
But like, I'm already too...

2105
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,760
I'm already too far in.

2106
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:34,280
I'm already too far in.

2107
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:37,000
Alright.

2108
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,340
I can do this.

2109
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:43,320
I just need to make sure I don't fucking fall off.

2110
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:46,880
Oh, why are you so janked up, man?

2111
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:51,840
Here's some yellow paint.

2112
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:55,100
Thank you for your very first Super Chat Admiral.

2113
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:56,160
Thank you.

2114
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:56,940
Thank you.

2115
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:59,460
Thank you for the yellow paint.

2116
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:01,200
I really appreciate it.

2117
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:04,240
Okay, we need to figure out how to climb this.

2118
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:05,400
I wonder if I can...

2119
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,880
I must be able to...

2120
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:10,320
Okay.

2121
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:10,880
Maybe...

2122
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:14,620
Okay, no.

2123
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:18,320
Wait, why can't I grab this?

2124
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:20,700
Can I grab this?

2125
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:23,340
Alright.

2126
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:27,880
No!

2127
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,080
The fucking...

2128
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:37,360
Okay.

2129
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,100
Alright, we're good.

2130
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:39,500
We can do this.

2131
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:42,220
Thank you for the...

2132
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:43,180
Give the ship.

2133
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:43,560
Thank you.

2134
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:44,280
Thank you.

2135
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,460
Where's the stairs?

2136
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:49,060
Where the fuck is the stairs?

2137
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,120
No, I figured it out!

2138
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:56,080
I just...

2139
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,340
I looked at the wrong way!

2140
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:01,340
Guys...

2141
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:04,180
Guys, is there a yellow paint mod in this game?

2142
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:06,920
No!

2143
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:08,400
What do you mean?

2144
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:08,980
No, no, no.

2145
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,100
It was like...

2146
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:11,440
It was the wrong button.

2147
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:12,880
I accidentally pressed the wrong button in chat.

2148
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:14,120
I'm not that stupid.

2149
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:15,400
Guys...

2150
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:16,420
I'm not...

2151
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:17,420
I'm not...

2152
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:18,120
Guys!

2153
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:19,860
I swear I'm not that stupid.

2154
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:23,160
I accidentally pressed the wrong button in chat.

2155
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:23,700
I...

2156
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,560
I like pressed the wrong button.

2157
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:26,660
And I knew where...

2158
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:27,540
I knew what to do!

2159
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:28,240
I swear!

2160
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:28,900
I swear!

2161
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:30,020
I swear!

2162
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,000
Okay.

2163
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:34,560
This is it.

2164
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:34,980
This time.

2165
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:37,280
This time.

2166
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:39,580
I was just trying to teach you guys what not to do.

2167
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:43,980
I was trying to teach you guys what not to do in this game.

2168
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,380
Because I know a lot of people, this is like their first time playing.

2169
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,920
So they don't know, like, the basics.

2170
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,640
So like, that's what I'm here for.

2171
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:52,800
I'm like, guys, don't do this.

2172
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,220
Remember?

2173
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:06,280
Guys...

2174
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:08,480
I told you.

2175
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:08,840
Don't...

2176
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:09,320
Don't...

2177
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:09,860
Don't do that.

2178
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:10,720
Don't...

2179
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:12,100
Don't...

2180
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:12,780
Don't do that.

2181
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:13,720
Guys...

2182
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,540
I told you!

2183
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:18,860
It's a great lesson to learn!

2184
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:19,780
To not do!

2185
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:25,420
I told you guys!

2186
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:26,200
It's a...

2187
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:26,600
It's a...

2188
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,180
It's a...

2189
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:40,000
I'm trying to show you guys all the examples of the wrong things to do, chat.

2190
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:41,360
You're welcome.

2191
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:43,920
You're welcome.

2192
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:46,180
Alright, alright, alright.

2193
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:51,360
So now that you know all the things you shouldn't do...

2194
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:55,140
Here is what the actual answer was.

2195
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,480
Alright, here we go.

2196
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:59,760
The answer might surprise you.

2197
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:05,160
Don't worry.

2198
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,880
The answer is going to surprise all of you.

2199
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,320
It's going to be crazy.

2200
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:12,680
It's going to be fucking crazy.

2201
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:17,240
Alright, so what you do is...

2202
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:18,080
Okay.

2203
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,000
Alright, here we go.

2204
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:22,220
Woo!

2205
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:25,340
Alright.

2206
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:28,440
And then...

2207
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:30,680
You...

2208
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,420
You do that.

2209
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:33,880
Yes!

2210
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:36,040
Oh fuck, I'm so smart!

2211
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:37,580
Okay, and then...

2212
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:38,260
There we go.

2213
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:38,460
See?

2214
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:39,860
I told you.

2215
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:42,500
The answer will surprise you.

2216
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,140
We did it.

2217
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:47,260
Yay.

2218
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:49,960
Yay.

2219
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:53,800
Alright, my new client.

2220
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:56,540
Here he comes.

2221
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:01,800
Here's my new client.

2222
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:03,660
Word of mouth.

2223
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,080
Look at that.

2224
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,980
He woke up from a really bad headache.

2225
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:14,360
But don't worry, sir.

2226
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,280
I'll give you the Doki Bird experience.

2227
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,600
To help you relieve that stress.

2228
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:23,040
He just woke up.

2229
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,380
He's a little angy.

2230
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:26,020
But do not worry.

2231
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:27,540
Where is your weak point?

2232
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:28,700
Not your head.

2233
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:29,900
Your belly button?

2234
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:32,660
Why is your stress in your belly button?

2235
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:37,380
Sir.

2236
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:40,260
Sir, why are you stressed out in the belly?

2237
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:41,380
Did you have a tummy...

2238
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:42,220
Does your tummy hurt?

2239
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:43,460
Sir?

2240
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:44,040
Sir!

2241
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:44,740
Sir!

2242
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:45,600
No, no, no, no, no!

2243
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:45,800
Sir!

2244
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:46,420
Sir!

2245
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:47,500
Oh shit!

2246
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:48,560
Okay, we're fine.

2247
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:50,380
We're fine.

2248
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:52,500
Where is his weak point?

2249
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:53,880
I can't tell.

2250
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:57,020
His tummy hurt.

2251
01:31:57,740 --> 01:31:59,180
Where is his weak point at?

2252
01:31:59,400 --> 01:31:59,880
I don't know.

2253
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,600
Sir, I know your tummy hurt.

2254
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:04,460
You gotta let...

2255
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:07,100
You gotta be careful what you eat.

2256
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:10,980
Oh, what the...

2257
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,120
How does that hurt me?

2258
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:12,920
It's just rock!

2259
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:17,320
It's just rock!

2260
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:19,900
Sir, I need you to...

2261
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:23,320
Sir, I need you to fucking throw your sword down.

2262
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:25,760
Okay.

2263
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:27,100
Sir!

2264
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:29,860
Sir, the longer you delay this...

2265
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:31,220
The more I charge you!

2266
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:32,540
I work...

2267
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:35,220
I work $60 an hour!

2268
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:36,420
Sir!

2269
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,440
This is a $60 an hour experience!

2270
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:43,740
Throw down the sword!

2271
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:47,200
Maybe that's why it hurts.

2272
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:55,920
Only si...

2273
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,320
Alright, nice.

2274
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:00,220
He's throwing it down.

2275
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:01,620
Nice.

2276
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:03,880
Alright, how do I climb the sword?

2277
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,840
How the fuck do I climb...?

2278
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:07,080
What?

2279
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:08,400
No, it's at the backside?

2280
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:11,040
Oh my god.

2281
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:14,740
Oh, it was at the backside.

2282
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,740
Guys, you're getting really dumb.

2283
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:21,520
Look, I gotta start my clientele!

2284
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:26,930
I'm fucking jacked.

2285
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,080
Thank you for the potential, super.

2286
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,620
Oh, I can bring the music up.

2287
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:30,980
Okay.

2288
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:33,380
Guys, I'm just starting out.

2289
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:33,620
Oh!

2290
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:36,860
I'm literally... I invest zero dollars in advertising.

2291
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,820
It's just by word of mouth.

2292
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:40,400
This is only my third client.

2293
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:46,020
I'm trying to figure out how to climb the fucking sword.

2294
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:48,380
Alright, here we go.

2295
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:52,140
Knock it to the ground?

2296
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:53,700
The armor seems brittle?

2297
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,100
Oh shit, is it?

2298
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:57,920
Bro, I don't know.

2299
01:33:58,060 --> 01:33:58,740
Thank you.

2300
01:33:58,780 --> 01:33:59,600
Thank you for...

2301
01:33:59,600 --> 01:33:59,860
Okay.

2302
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:01,800
Don't worry.

2303
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:03,640
Apparently his armor is brittle.

2304
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:05,020
Don't worry.

2305
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:09,760
Eventually this puny arrow is gonna do something.

2306
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:13,920
Oh fuck!

2307
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:14,300
Okay.

2308
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:15,640
How to climb?

2309
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:16,380
How to climb?

2310
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:17,540
There's something to climb!

2311
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:18,520
There's something to climb!

2312
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:21,760
I'm just gonna...

2313
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:22,760
Fuck you!

2314
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:23,680
Fuck you!

2315
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:25,620
Fuck you!

2316
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:29,220
Even died.

2317
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,580
Just fast eating.

2318
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:36,600
Woo!

2319
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:38,360
Woo!

2320
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:40,800
Trying to figure out where to climb.

2321
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:42,580
But I can't find it.

2322
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:42,740
Oh!

2323
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:46,920
I'm sinking!

2324
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:48,920
Maybe I can climb you.

2325
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:49,680
No.

2326
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,080
No no no no no no no no no!

2327
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:53,360
Okay, maybe I can climb this.

2328
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:54,400
No?

2329
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:57,240
I know!

2330
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:59,060
God, I know!

2331
01:34:59,600 --> 01:34:59,960
God!

2332
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:01,620
God, I'm sinking!

2333
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:07,840
I'm sinking, God!

2334
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:11,000
Okay.

2335
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:12,560
God, please.

2336
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:16,300
Please, you have to be more direct with me.

2337
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:18,100
Wait.

2338
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:19,140
Wait.

2339
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:20,240
No, please.

2340
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:21,540
Swing your sword.

2341
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:23,040
Swing your sword again.

2342
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:26,880
Let me cook.

2343
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:27,060
Look.

2344
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:27,940
Oh!

2345
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:29,020
Oh, I figured it out!

2346
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:29,340
I know!

2347
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:29,920
I know what to do!

2348
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:31,200
I know what to do!

2349
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:32,820
Swing that sword!

2350
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:37,460
I can't believe God is backseeing me.

2351
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:41,820
I can't believe God is backseeing me.

2352
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,300
God, please.

2353
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:47,460
I know.

2354
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:49,800
I know this is frustrating to watch.

2355
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:50,440
God.

2356
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:52,940
I swear I am trying.

2357
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:54,660
He just let go his...

2358
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:55,000
No!

2359
01:35:55,820 --> 01:35:56,540
No!

2360
01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:09,890
That was it!

2361
01:36:10,770 --> 01:36:11,490
No!

2362
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:14,230
I was too slow!

2363
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:16,250
Please!

2364
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:17,450
Please again!

2365
01:36:17,890 --> 01:36:18,830
He's doing it.

2366
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:19,310
He's doing it.

2367
01:36:22,050 --> 01:36:22,770
What?

2368
01:36:22,770 --> 01:36:23,930
Oh, I did it!

2369
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:27,850
That's what the circle was for!

2370
01:36:29,010 --> 01:36:30,250
Oh my God!

2371
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:33,390
I fucking did it!

2372
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:34,630
Okay.

2373
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:36,310
I figured it out.

2374
01:36:36,850 --> 01:36:38,290
I figured it out, guys.

2375
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:40,210
I broke his armor!

2376
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:42,770
Oh shit!

2377
01:36:44,210 --> 01:36:47,810
Guys, I think... Guys, I am not okay.

2378
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:56,850
Guys, I was not okay.

2379
01:36:57,050 --> 01:36:58,850
Guys, I don't know.

2380
01:36:58,930 --> 01:36:59,170
God.

2381
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:00,610
I think God saved me there.

2382
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:04,940
Oh God.

2383
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:05,800
Oh God.

2384
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:06,700
Okay.

2385
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:08,680
This is it.

2386
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:09,980
I figured it out.

2387
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:13,100
This is it.

2388
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:14,640
Oh God.

2389
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:17,840
After

2390
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:22,510
20 years!

2391
01:37:23,230 --> 01:37:24,510
God, I did it!

2392
01:37:25,110 --> 01:37:26,110
I climbed!

2393
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:32,070
Holy shit.

2394
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:33,850
Doki did it.

2395
01:37:34,190 --> 01:37:34,830
No!

2396
01:37:35,070 --> 01:37:35,710
No!

2397
01:37:35,710 --> 01:37:37,450
Clean fucking holding!

2398
01:37:37,450 --> 01:37:39,050
What is wrong with you?

2399
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:42,410
Where am I teleporting to?

2400
01:37:45,810 --> 01:37:46,210
Okay.

2401
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:47,410
Bro!

2402
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:49,970
Climb up this fucking... Bro!

2403
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:52,070
I swear to God, kid!

2404
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:54,930
Kid, I swear to fucking God!

2405
01:37:59,810 --> 01:38:01,710
Bro, this fucking kid, man.

2406
01:38:02,390 --> 01:38:04,130
Okay, we need to get to the tummy.

2407
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:05,910
Because his tummy hurt.

2408
01:38:06,610 --> 01:38:07,010
Wait.

2409
01:38:09,330 --> 01:38:09,730
Okay.

2410
01:38:10,570 --> 01:38:11,630
His tummy hurt.

2411
01:38:11,770 --> 01:38:13,450
We need to fucking head to the tummy.

2412
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:16,490
It's the tummy, right?

2413
01:38:17,110 --> 01:38:18,430
Or can I stab the head?

2414
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:19,390
No, it's his tummy.

2415
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:20,230
Okay.

2416
01:38:20,850 --> 01:38:21,450
Okay, kid.

2417
01:38:21,890 --> 01:38:22,290
Okay.

2418
01:38:22,290 --> 01:38:22,450
Okay.

2419
01:38:23,370 --> 01:38:24,170
Okay.

2420
01:38:24,990 --> 01:38:25,830
Tummy time.

2421
01:38:28,090 --> 01:38:28,990
Oh God.

2422
01:38:29,150 --> 01:38:30,730
Oh, fucking hell.

2423
01:38:30,950 --> 01:38:32,490
Oh God.

2424
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:33,490
Alright, there we go.

2425
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:35,090
There's his tummy.

2426
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:36,530
Don't worry!

2427
01:38:37,570 --> 01:38:39,190
The Doki experience!

2428
01:38:40,430 --> 01:38:44,190
We will let out all that stress!

2429
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:46,210
Ha!

2430
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:48,770
There we go.

2431
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:49,470
No!

2432
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:57,200
Don't worry!

2433
01:38:58,700 --> 01:38:59,220
Don't worry!

2434
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:00,060
Oh my God!

2435
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:01,540
No wonder your tummy hurt!

2436
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,200
Look at all the stress!

2437
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,560
Don't worry, Sam!

2438
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:16,500
You will be a happy cl... It looks like a dog with, like, boxing gloves.

2439
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:17,740
You look at it close enough.

2440
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,180
Oh no.

2441
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:20,000
Oh no.

2442
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:20,740
Oh no.

2443
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:22,940
Oh no!

2444
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:25,720
Oh, we're just gonna rest here for a little bit.

2445
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,280
I think we're fine.

2446
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:27,840
Okay.

2447
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:30,160
I think we're fine.

2448
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:31,260
You look hard enough.

2449
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:33,300
It does look like a dog with boxing gloves on.

2450
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:35,440
Oh God.

2451
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:35,800
Okay.

2452
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:36,600
Don't worry.

2453
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:37,960
We're just gonna rest a little bit.

2454
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:39,360
And then...

2455
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:41,360
Okay.

2456
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:43,380
And then stop!

2457
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:43,920
No!

2458
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:44,500
Come on!

2459
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,480
Just need to do one step!

2460
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:48,380
Bro!

2461
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:50,000
Let me fucking...

2462
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:50,720
Boop!

2463
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:51,220
There we go.

2464
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:52,400
A little tiny poke.

2465
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:54,640
A little tiny poke.

2466
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:55,720
I'm gonna rest here now.

2467
01:39:57,140 --> 01:39:58,600
And then... Oh no.

2468
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:00,280
Jumping is so scary.

2469
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:01,780
One more.

2470
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:03,280
Boop!

2471
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:05,200
Is that it?

2472
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:06,420
Is it just your tummy?

2473
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:08,040
Is there anywhere else?

2474
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:11,200
Just your little tummy?

2475
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:14,640
Oh no.

2476
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:15,960
Now it has to be the head.

2477
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:18,120
The head is always, like, the last spot.

2478
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:19,500
Okay.

2479
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:21,440
Up I go.

2480
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:23,520
Up I go!

2481
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:28,620
How do I get up?

2482
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:30,980
How do I get up without having to worry?

2483
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:32,260
How do I...

2484
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:34,720
How do I get up from here?

2485
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:38,520
From up the fucking... back?

2486
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:40,540
Oh no.

2487
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:41,600
Oh no.

2488
01:40:46,230 --> 01:40:47,020
From the arm?

2489
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:47,860
Oh maybe.

2490
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:49,460
Okay, do you think I can make it?

2491
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:50,700
Alright, alright.

2492
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:52,420
Please stop swinging, sir!

2493
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:55,440
The longer it is, the more you have to charge!

2494
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:57,020
Sir!

2495
01:40:57,740 --> 01:41:02,360
I do not feel very good charging you such a high bill, but I will if I have to!

2496
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:03,720
Okay, there we go.

2497
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:05,200
Where am I?

2498
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:06,700
I am here.

2499
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:07,960
Alright.

2500
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:09,940
Don't worry, just resting a little bit.

2501
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:11,320
Boop!

2502
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:12,520
Okay.

2503
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:13,380
Climb.

2504
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:14,180
Climb.

2505
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:15,620
Keep climbing.

2506
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:21,800
There we go.

2507
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:22,180
We are fine.

2508
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:24,080
We are okay.

2509
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:26,380
I climb.

2510
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:28,640
I climb!

2511
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:30,600
Oh god.

2512
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:31,520
My stamina though.

2513
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:33,100
It's fine.

2514
01:41:37,870 --> 01:41:39,420
The hell, Vang jumped!

2515
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:40,340
Oh!

2516
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:42,220
Don't worry.

2517
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,440
This is the DokiBur special.

2518
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:45,420
Every client requests for it.

2519
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:47,680
You will be fine!

2520
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:49,500
It's just the stress oil.

2521
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:50,620
Nothing to worry about.

2522
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:51,460
I did not poke.

2523
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:53,860
I have so much experience with this.

2524
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:57,960
You don't have to worry, sir.

2525
01:41:58,220 --> 01:41:59,420
I did not...

2526
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:01,560
I did not hit any vital...

2527
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:03,760
Vital nerves!

2528
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:05,160
Your brain is okay!

2529
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:07,940
Your brain...

2530
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:13,880
Let's open the seventh chakra right now.

2531
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:16,200
Just a simple scalp massage.

2532
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:19,240
Nine out of ten.

2533
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:21,840
Ten doctors recommend to cure your headache.

2534
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,580
And now he doesn't suffer anymore.

2535
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,540
Now he doesn't have any more headaches.

2536
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:32,580
It's just a bad blood coming out.

2537
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:35,620
Guys, it's just a bad blood.

2538
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:37,060
Nice!

2539
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:39,020
Another Google review.

2540
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:47,000
Another happy client.

2541
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:51,800
I hope they keep recommending me to future clients.

2542
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:57,500
Yeah.

2543
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:01,120
Yayy!

2544
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:04,840
No more tummy hurt.

2545
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:06,340
Look at that!

2546
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:08,820
Look at all these Google reviews.

2547
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:11,620
Now I can put my bed over there.

2548
01:43:17,150 --> 01:43:18,910
Another happy land.

2549
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:19,550
Yeah!

2550
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:24,720
Every single...

2551
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:25,960
Pac...

2552
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:29,200
Exactly!

2553
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:34,700
Somebody understands!

2554
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,000
I'm so good at this.

2555
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:40,660
You're too good at this?

2556
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:41,860
No, they'll come back, right?

2557
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:45,040
They'll come back for more...

2558
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:46,220
Happy landing!

2559
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:54,220
They land on the ground out of happiness.

2560
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:58,620
Fearful it is not.

2561
01:43:58,980 --> 01:44:02,000
I mean, to be fair, it's called Colossus.

2562
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:04,220
So, aren't they technically all giants?

2563
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:09,220
100% satisfaction guarantee.

2564
01:44:09,300 --> 01:44:09,940
Exactly!

2565
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:11,760
Yay!

2566
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:16,040
Bro, I don't think I'm gonna out-jank this guy.

2567
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:18,360
This kid is gonna be forever fucked up.

2568
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:22,300
Holy shit!

2569
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:25,540
He's so fucked up.

2570
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:27,300
A cat in the way!

2571
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:37,920
We just live like this now.

2572
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:40,580
Ever since we ate that bad...

2573
01:44:40,580 --> 01:44:41,860
The bad lizard.

2574
01:44:43,780 --> 01:44:44,500
This way.

2575
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:45,500
This way?

2576
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:46,400
Where is this way?

2577
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:48,920
This way?

2578
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:52,120
I guess it's this way.

2579
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,660
Ever since we ate that bad lizard...

2580
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:56,020
Life has not been the same.

2581
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:57,840
Come on!

2582
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:00,780
Are you still mad at me that I shot the arrow?

2583
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,480
You know you need more training with the arrow stuff.

2584
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:05,300
It's not my fault.

2585
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:06,780
Harlow.

2586
01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:11,200
Alright, here you go.

2587
01:45:15,990 --> 01:45:18,110
Yeah, no one ever complains.

2588
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:20,390
Because everyone had a good time.

2589
01:45:20,950 --> 01:45:21,930
This is this way.

2590
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:26,620
This is the way.

2591
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:27,500
No, if he...

2592
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:30,080
Okay, no, actually horses can hold grudges.

2593
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:33,600
Like, they actually can fuck you up if they hate you.

2594
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:38,940
That's why you never stand behind a horse.

2595
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,980
Because they can actually mess you up.

2596
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:45,660
You can actually break your back if the horse does not like you.

2597
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:47,920
But, good thing for me...

2598
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:49,220
Ida loves me.

2599
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:51,940
He loves me.

2600
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:54,320
Because I've always been like, so nice to him.

2601
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:57,280
Oh god, I do not like this area.

2602
01:45:57,580 --> 01:45:58,820
It looks so fucking...

2603
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:00,400
It looks...

2604
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:03,540
I'm just training him to be a better horse.

2605
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:04,860
Chat?

2606
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:07,520
He needs to be prepared.

2607
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:09,040
For the real shit.

2608
01:46:16,540 --> 01:46:17,320
Where am I?

2609
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:18,580
Is it a turtle?

2610
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:20,300
Is this a turtle giant?

2611
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:21,460
Wait, I remember this!

2612
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,080
Wait, I remember this...

2613
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:24,700
Turtle giant.

2614
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:24,860
Jump.

2615
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:26,020
Jump, Arlo.

2616
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:26,940
Jump.

2617
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:28,620
What, are you scared?

2618
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:30,020
Okay, yeah, that's...

2619
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:32,040
Actually, I just realized you cannot jump that.

2620
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,560
Okay, wait, but I can.

2621
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:37,720
Can I jump that?

2622
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:38,640
I'm not scared.

2623
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:41,780
Speedrun.

2624
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:42,840
There you go.

2625
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:45,240
You see, I'm fine.

2626
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:47,880
So smart.

2627
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:48,820
See?

2628
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:50,620
I don't need a journalist difficulty.

2629
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:52,220
I just figured it out myself.

2630
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:54,340
Now, where do I go?

2631
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:56,100
Oh,

2632
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:00,020
this way.

2633
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:03,780
Alright.

2634
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:07,900
This way.

2635
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:10,520
I'm speedrunning.

2636
01:47:10,860 --> 01:47:11,480
Look at that.

2637
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:12,620
Three bosses down.

2638
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:16,220
No, it's Ikea he...

2639
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:19,980
I still can't believe that actually happened.

2640
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:22,200
I can't believe Ikea actually saw that.

2641
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:22,780
Ikea actually sold, like...

2642
01:47:23,990 --> 01:47:25,040
Like, what the...

2643
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:26,080
How did that happen?

2644
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:28,300
That is such a fucking oversight.

2645
01:47:30,620 --> 01:47:31,620
Oh shit.

2646
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:32,740
You made it?

2647
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:33,840
How?

2648
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,800
How did you get here?

2649
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:39,240
Have you guys never heard?

2650
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,300
In Ikea.

2651
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:43,680
Like, it was a long time ago.

2652
01:47:43,820 --> 01:47:49,540
But Ikea, accidentally, quote-unquote, sold horse meatballs.

2653
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,560
I'm a horse.

2654
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:52,120
I'm a horse.

2655
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:53,940
And then people found out.

2656
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,100
We're like, what?

2657
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:58,580
We've been eating horse meat this entire time?

2658
01:48:03,130 --> 01:48:03,650
Yeah!

2659
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:07,050
Now we're... yeah, and then we found out.

2660
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:10,890
And then they're like, oh that was an accident.

2661
01:48:11,590 --> 01:48:15,650
And then so like, you know, we don't eat horse meatballs anymore!

2662
01:48:17,370 --> 01:48:18,990
Wait, is it this guy?

2663
01:48:19,270 --> 01:48:20,830
That has to be the giant, right?

2664
01:48:21,310 --> 01:48:22,550
That has to be him.

2665
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:28,150
Well, I don't have the sun, so I have to figure out if it's this guy that... or in the cave I go.

2666
01:48:30,850 --> 01:48:32,090
This is a little oopsie.

2667
01:48:32,170 --> 01:48:33,830
That has to be a colossus.

2668
01:48:33,850 --> 01:48:34,750
Like, look at him.

2669
01:48:38,860 --> 01:48:41,020
Oh my god, it's like a Komodo dragon.

2670
01:48:52,170 --> 01:48:52,970
New customer!

2671
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:55,770
Oh my god, did Arlo recommend you?

2672
01:48:57,730 --> 01:48:59,010
Okay, where's your spot?

2673
01:48:59,290 --> 01:48:59,650
Head?

2674
01:49:00,130 --> 01:49:00,870
Oh, it's the head.

2675
01:49:01,010 --> 01:49:01,190
Okay.

2676
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:03,670
Alright.

2677
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:04,310
Let's see.

2678
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:04,430
Let's see.

2679
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:05,690
What do I do?

2680
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:07,790
What do I do?

2681
01:49:07,910 --> 01:49:09,330
Do I shoot you in the stomach?

2682
01:49:10,230 --> 01:49:11,950
Can I grasp you tightly?

2683
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:13,150
No.

2684
01:49:13,650 --> 01:49:14,970
I'll distract him!

2685
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:16,270
He likes horses!

2686
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:19,550
Don't worry, I'm gonna shoot him in the butt.

2687
01:49:22,030 --> 01:49:22,550
Look.

2688
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:23,070
See?

2689
01:49:23,310 --> 01:49:25,750
He kills one of them by just doing that.

2690
01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:27,030
That means...

2691
01:49:28,990 --> 01:49:33,070
Imagine if I just... this entire stream, I just do this.

2692
01:49:34,430 --> 01:49:36,330
This is the entire stream.

2693
01:49:40,050 --> 01:49:41,950
Okay, the environment.

2694
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:46,070
Why am I limping?

2695
01:49:46,650 --> 01:49:47,950
Why are you limping?

2696
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:52,130
Let's see.

2697
01:49:52,570 --> 01:49:55,350
How do I use the environment against you?

2698
01:50:00,850 --> 01:50:01,990
How do I...

2699
01:50:03,670 --> 01:50:05,010
Do I go here?

2700
01:50:06,550 --> 01:50:08,490
There is a tunnel down there.

2701
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:10,770
Where is it?

2702
01:50:10,790 --> 01:50:12,190
What's the tunnels anyway?

2703
01:50:14,770 --> 01:50:15,950
Go into the cave?

2704
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:18,770
Yeah, I was like wondering what the cave was for.

2705
01:50:19,810 --> 01:50:20,290
Alright.

2706
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:21,630
I'll be right back!

2707
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:23,630
I gotta get some extra materials, sir!

2708
01:50:24,030 --> 01:50:24,710
Don't worry!

2709
01:50:25,930 --> 01:50:26,970
Wait, there's another way.

2710
01:50:27,890 --> 01:50:28,590
Oh no.

2711
01:50:29,070 --> 01:50:30,210
There's two pathways.

2712
01:50:32,990 --> 01:50:35,930
Oh, cuz there's multiple cave entrances!

2713
01:50:38,890 --> 01:50:39,630
Wait, what?

2714
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:46,050
Sorry, what?

2715
01:50:47,270 --> 01:50:48,310
Now I'm here.

2716
01:50:55,610 --> 01:50:56,670
Wait, wait!

2717
01:50:56,730 --> 01:50:57,410
My head?

2718
01:50:57,550 --> 01:50:58,150
It's turning?

2719
01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:00,430
I got it.

2720
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:01,170
I figured it out.

2721
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:02,910
I figured it out.

2722
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:04,650
I know what to do.

2723
01:51:06,950 --> 01:51:08,350
Hello, I am here now.

2724
01:51:10,270 --> 01:51:10,690
Hello.

2725
01:51:11,690 --> 01:51:12,970
I'm gonna poke you in the ass.

2726
01:51:13,570 --> 01:51:14,150
Come on.

2727
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:15,910
Come on.

2728
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:18,710
Stop looking at my horse!

2729
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:21,910
Come on!

2730
01:51:23,930 --> 01:51:24,750
I'm right here!

2731
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:30,730
I'm right here!

2732
01:51:30,770 --> 01:51:31,590
Don't you see me?

2733
01:51:35,890 --> 01:51:37,110
I don't think he likes that.

2734
01:51:37,170 --> 01:51:37,790
He does not like that.

2735
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:38,510
He does not like that.

2736
01:51:38,910 --> 01:51:39,590
Down here!

2737
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:43,960
Arlo!

2738
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:46,040
Stop baiting the horse!

2739
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:49,940
Turn around!

2740
01:51:56,980 --> 01:51:57,780
Turn around!

2741
01:51:58,080 --> 01:51:59,000
I'm right here!

2742
01:51:59,000 --> 01:51:59,600
I'm right here!

2743
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:04,340
Alright.

2744
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:08,940
We gotta make sure the fucking giant horse knows I'm here.

2745
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:11,660
I think he fell in love with my horse.

2746
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:15,480
I think he fell in love with my horse.

2747
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:19,080
I'm right here, asshole!

2748
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:21,100
That's fucking right.

2749
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:22,280
Yeah, that's right.

2750
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:22,960
That's right.

2751
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:23,600
You see me?

2752
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:25,840
That's fucking right!

2753
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:27,340
I'm right here!

2754
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:27,640
I'm here!

2755
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:29,980
I don't know if that worked!

2756
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:34,200
Alright, that must have worked, right?

2757
01:52:34,740 --> 01:52:37,120
He must have seen me yawning in the caves.

2758
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:40,640
Does he know?

2759
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:42,980
Does he know?

2760
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:46,400
I'm right here!

2761
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:48,540
Come down!

2762
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:51,700
Fight me like a real horse!

2763
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:55,640
I'm literally right here!

2764
01:52:57,340 --> 01:52:59,520
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

2765
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:08,760
Alright, no more horsing around!

2766
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:10,800
Alright.

2767
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:16,980
You see the Colossus to reach his back.

2768
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:17,380
Okay.

2769
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:18,700
Thank you, God.

2770
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:20,520
Thank you for the backseating.

2771
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:22,640
I really appreciate it.

2772
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:23,320
Wait, where did he go?

2773
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:25,140
Bro, what the fuck?

2774
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:26,240
He just gave up!

2775
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:35,060
He just... he just gave up on me!

2776
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:37,920
Horse!

2777
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,040
I'm not just a mosquito!

2778
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:44,240
I am your therapist!

2779
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,420
And I can see you're so fucking tensed up right now.

2780
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:49,220
Look at you!

2781
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:50,880
You're so tensed!

2782
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:58,120
You're so lucky your friends recommended me to take care of you.

2783
01:54:01,340 --> 01:54:02,200
Oh my God.

2784
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:03,520
Where's the other way to the cave?

2785
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:05,520
Where's the other way to the cave?

2786
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:07,580
Where's the other way to the cave?

2787
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:09,980
He's looking, he's looking.

2788
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:12,580
He's casually looking at me now.

2789
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:13,900
Turn around!

2790
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:15,640
Turn around!

2791
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:17,660
Turn around!

2792
01:54:19,570 --> 01:54:21,820
I'm trying my best, guys!

2793
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:24,050
Hehehehehehe!

2794
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:25,620
Ok...

2795
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:26,000
Hahaha!

2796
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:28,060
Hahaha!

2797
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:33,620
God, I am trying my best, but he's too smart to be deceived.

2798
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:38,740
Bro, he just doesn't care!

2799
01:54:41,620 --> 01:54:45,100
He doesn't fucking care what I do!

2800
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:51,020
Sir, you're being charged for every hour!

2801
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:52,340
Sir!

2802
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:57,820
My rate has now increased to $80 an hour, sir!

2803
01:54:58,780 --> 01:54:59,760
Turn around!

2804
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:09,120
Bro, but look at the damage though.

2805
01:55:09,340 --> 01:55:10,860
Guys, look at...

2806
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:15,260
Look at all that damage I did.

2807
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:18,400
That one speck of damage.

2808
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:20,740
Stop, dude.

2809
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:24,100
Guys, it's called acupuncture.

2810
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:27,100
Come over here.

2811
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:28,560
Come over here.

2812
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:37,180
I charge... I got better with experience, so I can charge $80 now.

2813
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:39,940
I got better at my job.

2814
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:40,880
I'm right here.

2815
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:42,260
I'm right here, horse.

2816
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:43,780
I'm right here.

2817
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:45,060
Turn around.

2818
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:46,360
Arlo, please.

2819
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:47,820
Please, Arlo.

2820
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:51,280
This is between me and the fucking other horse.

2821
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:52,380
I know you're jealous!

2822
01:55:54,260 --> 01:55:55,820
But me and this horse...

2823
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:57,760
We gotta settle something here.

2824
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:02,200
Alright.

2825
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:03,480
You see me?

2826
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:05,320
Do you see me?

2827
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:07,220
Yeah, right?

2828
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:08,100
You see me, right?

2829
01:56:08,220 --> 01:56:08,820
Oh, fuck.

2830
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:09,820
I think he knows now.

2831
01:56:09,980 --> 01:56:10,940
I think he understands.

2832
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:11,960
Oh, God.

2833
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:13,680
Oh, he definitely understands.

2834
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:15,000
He definitely understands.

2835
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:16,260
Alright.

2836
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:20,040
He understands now.

2837
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:25,440
Okay.

2838
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:26,800
Oh, my God.

2839
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:27,600
Why am I so jink?

2840
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:28,120
Please.

2841
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:29,380
Please don't turn around.

2842
01:56:32,900 --> 01:56:35,460
I am trying so hard to deceive him!

2843
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:37,140
But he doesn't care!

2844
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:38,860
He doesn't!

2845
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:44,420
What did I do?

2846
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:44,960
Okay.

2847
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:45,700
I got it.

2848
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:48,640
Wait.

2849
01:56:48,740 --> 01:56:49,720
I deceived him.

2850
01:56:49,820 --> 01:56:50,020
I got it.

2851
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:51,300
Oh, my God.

2852
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:51,960
What did I do from here?

2853
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:53,380
Do I just...

2854
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:55,960
Do I just climb?

2855
01:56:58,540 --> 01:56:59,280
Oh, shit.

2856
01:56:59,380 --> 01:57:00,140
Oh, shit.

2857
01:57:00,220 --> 01:57:00,880
Oh, shit.

2858
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:01,440
Oh, shit.

2859
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:01,500
Tail!

2860
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:02,060
Tail!

2861
01:57:02,140 --> 01:57:02,720
Grab the tail!

2862
01:57:11,410 --> 01:57:11,870
Board!

2863
01:57:12,190 --> 01:57:13,910
He got Board!

2864
01:57:19,420 --> 01:57:21,540
He got Board!

2865
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:26,500
He is the head.

2866
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:27,560
Oh, it's the brains!

2867
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:28,220
Okay.

2868
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:28,880
I can't figure it out.

2869
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:30,440
Guys, okay, he knows.

2870
01:57:30,580 --> 01:57:31,380
Okay, I'm right here.

2871
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:32,980
I'm right here.

2872
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:33,620
Come over here.

2873
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:37,880
I realized it was the brakes.

2874
01:57:37,960 --> 01:57:40,000
I thought it was supposed to be the tail.

2875
01:57:42,140 --> 01:57:42,580
Alright.

2876
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:45,160
You just don't pull somebody's hair, okay?

2877
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:46,460
It's like so rude.

2878
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:49,540
It's so rude to pull people's hairs.

2879
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:52,060
So like I was just trying to be like...

2880
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:53,040
polite.

2881
01:57:53,620 --> 01:57:54,220
You know?

2882
01:57:54,260 --> 01:57:56,840
It's okay to pull the tail but not the hair.

2883
01:57:58,220 --> 01:57:58,800
Alright, this time.

2884
01:57:58,920 --> 01:57:59,720
This time he knows.

2885
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:01,040
He knows, right?

2886
01:58:01,420 --> 01:58:02,300
I'm right here.

2887
01:58:03,180 --> 01:58:04,100
I'm right here.

2888
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:06,140
Okay, now he knows.

2889
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:08,320
Okay.

2890
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:10,020
Oh my god, please.

2891
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:11,660
Please.

2892
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:12,600
Please, kid.

2893
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:14,880
We're gonna kill...

2894
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:16,860
We're gonna kill this boss.

2895
01:58:19,180 --> 01:58:20,660
The tail is part of the treatment.

2896
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:22,640
The hair is always a no-go.

2897
01:58:24,980 --> 01:58:26,960
People don't like it when you touch the hair.

2898
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:29,460
Okay.

2899
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:31,940
There you go.

2900
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:33,180
I'm here.

2901
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:34,800
Don't worry.

2902
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:36,800
Don't worry.

2903
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:37,960
It's...

2904
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:40,560
I'm coming back here.

2905
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:42,140
Lower your head.

2906
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:44,460
Come on.

2907
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:45,360
Nice.

2908
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:45,540
Nice.

2909
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:45,800
Nice.

2910
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:46,080
Nice.

2911
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:46,360
Nice.

2912
01:58:46,420 --> 01:58:46,980
Nice.

2913
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:47,100
Nice.

2914
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:47,240
Nice.

2915
01:58:47,300 --> 01:58:47,300
Nice.

2916
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:48,500
Grab it.

2917
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:49,560
No!

2918
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,520
That was awkward.

2919
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:03,640
Alright.

2920
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:05,140
I didn't know how...

2921
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:07,080
How fucking short I jumped!

2922
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:09,920
This time!

2923
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:12,640
He's still there!

2924
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:13,720
He doesn't notice!

2925
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:14,560
It's okay.

2926
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:16,660
This time.

2927
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:18,360
He's gonna...

2928
01:59:18,780 --> 01:59:20,000
This time, this time, this time.

2929
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:21,400
There's no way he saw me this time.

2930
01:59:21,680 --> 01:59:22,420
Alright, lower, lower.

2931
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:23,100
Yes, yes.

2932
01:59:23,460 --> 01:59:23,900
Yes.

2933
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:25,200
That's good.

2934
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:26,560
That's good.

2935
01:59:26,900 --> 01:59:27,780
Just stay there.

2936
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:28,900
Just stay there.

2937
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:31,040
Yes!

2938
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:31,760
I did it!

2939
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:33,660
I told you.

2940
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:34,480
You just gotta believe.

2941
01:59:37,460 --> 01:59:38,980
You just... please.

2942
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:40,460
You just gotta believe.

2943
01:59:42,260 --> 01:59:44,060
You just gotta... Don't worry!

2944
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:47,060
The treatment is here!

2945
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:49,400
Okay.

2946
01:59:50,420 --> 01:59:51,160
Don't worry.

2947
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:52,740
I've never done it with a horse before.

2948
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:54,720
But like, it's a head.

2949
01:59:55,140 --> 01:59:56,340
Brains are the same.

2950
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,660
The head should be the same.

2951
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:01,560
It has a skull in there.

2952
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:06,780
It has a skull!

2953
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:10,360
And pointy things go in skull!

2954
02:00:12,260 --> 02:00:13,120
Here we go.

2955
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:15,280
Alright.

2956
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:15,880
Don't worry.

2957
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:16,260
We're fine.

2958
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:16,740
We're fine.

2959
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:18,140
Stab.

2960
02:00:18,620 --> 02:00:19,200
We're fine.

2961
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:20,340
It's fine.

2962
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:21,700
There's not a lot of blood.

2963
02:00:22,180 --> 02:00:23,200
Like human blood.

2964
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:24,160
But that is okay.

2965
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:26,420
It's okay.

2966
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:29,160
It can't be much different.

2967
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:30,440
It can't be much different.

2968
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:31,220
Please stop moving!

2969
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:32,280
Okay.

2970
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:33,900
Maybe if I just stay here in it right now.

2971
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:34,220
Alright.

2972
02:00:34,220 --> 02:00:34,620
Woah!

2973
02:00:34,620 --> 02:00:34,960
Woah!

2974
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:35,280
Woah!

2975
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:35,540
Woah!

2976
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:36,460
Sir!

2977
02:00:37,940 --> 02:00:39,500
I'm not done with the treatment!

2978
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:44,740
I should... Woah!

2979
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:45,080
Shit!

2980
02:00:45,140 --> 02:00:45,360
Okay.

2981
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:46,840
We gotta be able to grab this for now.

2982
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:47,800
Okay.

2983
02:00:47,820 --> 02:00:50,440
And then I can like chill a little bit and recharge my stuff.

2984
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:50,860
Woah!

2985
02:00:51,020 --> 02:00:51,360
No!

2986
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:51,660
No!

2987
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:51,880
No!

2988
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:52,060
No!

2989
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:52,220
No!

2990
02:00:52,220 --> 02:00:52,380
No!

2991
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:52,560
No!

2992
02:00:52,700 --> 02:00:53,100
No!

2993
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:53,200
No!

2994
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:53,740
Grab on!

2995
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:55,760
You have to keep grabbing on!

2996
02:00:56,540 --> 02:00:57,640
You have to keep grabbing on!

2997
02:00:59,020 --> 02:00:59,660
Oh god.

2998
02:00:59,740 --> 02:01:00,860
He's moving so much.

2999
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:02,360
He's moving so much.

3000
02:01:02,360 --> 02:01:02,940
It's so hard.

3001
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:03,440
Woah!

3002
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:06,320
Woah!

3003
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:06,460
That's okay.

3004
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:06,960
It's fine.

3005
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:07,520
No!

3006
02:01:07,620 --> 02:01:07,800
No!

3007
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:07,960
No!

3008
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:08,080
No!

3009
02:01:08,100 --> 02:01:08,220
No!

3010
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:10,140
Oh god.

3011
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:10,940
This is so difficult.

3012
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:13,280
Okay.

3013
02:01:13,420 --> 02:01:14,560
Just gonna recharge it here.

3014
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:15,620
He's chill.

3015
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:17,480
I'm like a little like head fly.

3016
02:01:18,860 --> 02:01:23,040
I'm like those like little birds that just stand on the head of like some fucking lion.

3017
02:01:23,480 --> 02:01:24,600
They're just like whatever.

3018
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:29,480
That's okay.

3019
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:30,580
You don't need to see the stamina.

3020
02:01:30,780 --> 02:01:31,820
Everything is okay.

3021
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:32,620
Hehehe.

3022
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:33,080
Hehehe.

3023
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:33,300
Hehehe.

3024
02:01:34,220 --> 02:01:36,940
As long... As long as it's working.

3025
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:38,860
Hold your horses.

3026
02:01:40,620 --> 02:01:41,180
Woo!

3027
02:01:42,980 --> 02:01:45,700
So we're just recharging it little by little and then...

3028
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:45,960
Stop!

3029
02:01:48,340 --> 02:01:48,900
Eehaw.

3030
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:50,560
God.

3031
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:51,600
You're so fucking stressed.

3032
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:53,080
Is that Martha?

3033
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:54,320
Are you and the kids alright?

3034
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:55,860
Did she take the kids?

3035
02:01:57,200 --> 02:01:57,760
Sir.

3036
02:01:58,280 --> 02:02:02,060
I don't think therapy can... I don't think... I don't think massage...

3037
02:02:02,060 --> 02:02:02,360
No!

3038
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:02,960
No!

3039
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:03,460
No!

3040
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:03,760
No!

3041
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:03,920
No!

3042
02:02:03,940 --> 02:02:04,040
No!

3043
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:04,140
No!

3044
02:02:04,140 --> 02:02:04,200
No!

3045
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:04,300
No!

3046
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:04,340
No!

3047
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:06,860
Oh hey, there's this.

3048
02:02:07,060 --> 02:02:08,040
Might as well stab this too.

3049
02:02:10,620 --> 02:02:11,980
I mean, it's here.

3050
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:13,380
So I might as well.

3051
02:02:16,100 --> 02:02:17,880
It's just like a little bonus area too.

3052
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:20,000
Oh nice, he's less stressed.

3053
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:24,580
Oh wait, what the fuck?

3054
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,240
How did you wake up?

3055
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:27,100
Oh no.

3056
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:27,280
Bro...

3057
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:32,240
Look, I think you need more than just massages, man.

3058
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:33,880
I know like...

3059
02:02:34,240 --> 02:02:39,860
You have some extra spending money now that you don't have to have to worry about like Martha and the kids.

3060
02:02:40,340 --> 02:02:41,800
But bro...

3061
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:45,460
You gotta get... You gotta like actually go to therapy, man.

3062
02:02:46,220 --> 02:02:47,460
Massages aren't therapy.

3063
02:02:50,920 --> 02:02:51,540
Oh shit.

3064
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,040
He's stressed.

3065
02:02:57,100 --> 02:02:57,560
Oh no.

3066
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:58,660
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3067
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:00,220
I can relax a little bit.

3068
02:03:00,420 --> 02:03:02,360
I can relax a little bit here.

3069
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:03,600
Alright.

3070
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:06,820
But holy shit, look at all these pent up blood.

3071
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:09,940
Don't worry.

3072
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:12,580
The best I can do is make you forget...

3073
02:03:12,580 --> 02:03:13,800
Just a little bit.

3074
02:03:14,340 --> 02:03:14,780
Alright?

3075
02:03:15,940 --> 02:03:17,700
You're just a few more stabs.

3076
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:21,420
What do you mean?

3077
02:03:21,540 --> 02:03:24,980
His child support payments are colossal.

3078
02:03:34,550 --> 02:03:36,290
Now he's relaxed forever.

3079
02:03:37,530 --> 02:03:39,870
I'm not licensed or anything.

3080
02:03:40,210 --> 02:03:42,050
But I don't need to be licensed.

3081
02:03:42,150 --> 02:03:43,170
I'm just that talented.

3082
02:03:44,050 --> 02:03:44,390
Yay.

3083
02:03:45,110 --> 02:03:49,390
So look, now he doesn't have to worry about the kids for today.

3084
02:03:54,010 --> 02:03:55,670
I just did it.

3085
02:03:56,850 --> 02:03:57,190
Yay!

3086
02:03:57,350 --> 02:03:58,190
I leveled up!

3087
02:03:59,550 --> 02:04:01,770
Now I charge a hundred dollars an hour.

3088
02:04:03,330 --> 02:04:05,370
Another 10 out of 10 review.

3089
02:04:05,970 --> 02:04:07,690
Dracula, welcome to the tomato farm.

3090
02:04:07,770 --> 02:04:08,370
Welcome, welcome.

3091
02:04:10,050 --> 02:04:11,850
I'm so good at my job.

3092
02:04:13,590 --> 02:04:14,570
Oh my god!

3093
02:04:14,690 --> 02:04:16,070
So many Google reviews.

3094
02:04:19,830 --> 02:04:22,150
If you're good at your job, you don't need a license.

3095
02:04:23,030 --> 02:04:24,530
I fixed depression.

3096
02:04:29,130 --> 02:04:32,230
10 out of 10, my wife left me.

3097
02:04:33,670 --> 02:04:34,690
That's a good thing.

3098
02:04:34,690 --> 02:04:35,250
And then...

3099
02:04:38,810 --> 02:04:43,190
and then for some reason, there were more IKEA meatballs after that.

3100
02:04:48,690 --> 02:04:50,230
Arlo, what are you doing?

3101
02:04:50,450 --> 02:04:51,870
Are you looking at my girlfriend for it?

3102
02:04:57,030 --> 02:04:58,290
10 out of 10!

3103
02:05:08,190 --> 02:05:10,770
Pass the colossus shadow across a misty lake.

3104
02:05:10,850 --> 02:05:12,290
Oh, is this a fish, Colossus?

3105
02:05:15,030 --> 02:05:19,290
Is this a... I fucking was playing for two hours?!

3106
02:05:19,290 --> 02:05:22,890
Okay, this game fucking makes time pass by so fast.

3107
02:05:23,070 --> 02:05:24,490
This does not feel like two hours.

3108
02:05:24,870 --> 02:05:27,370
I did not feel like I was playing for two hours!

3109
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:33,350
Holy shit.

3110
02:05:35,270 --> 02:05:35,790
Damn.

3111
02:05:36,410 --> 02:05:37,830
That means I've only...

3112
02:05:39,350 --> 02:05:40,270
Okay, gotta pray.

3113
02:05:40,470 --> 02:05:41,110
Pray to save!

3114
02:05:43,970 --> 02:05:44,450
Pray.

3115
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:48,960
Alright.

3116
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:52,120
Where do we go?

3117
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:54,440
Sword, tell me where do I go?

3118
02:05:56,380 --> 02:05:58,220
Where the fuck do I go, Sword?

3119
02:05:59,420 --> 02:06:00,520
Where is it telling me?

3120
02:06:00,700 --> 02:06:01,100
What?

3121
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:02,660
This way?

3122
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:06,580
I have to go to the lake.

3123
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:07,200
Here.

3124
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:07,800
Okay.

3125
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:09,400
Alright, Arlo.

3126
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:11,180
Arlo, come over here.

3127
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:14,740
I need to go to a lake now.

3128
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,160
I'm doing good progress.

3129
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:19,080
I got like four clients so far.

3130
02:06:21,780 --> 02:06:25,080
Will you guys let me drill a hole into your head to let out your stress?

3131
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:32,700
For like a hundred dollars an hour?

3132
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:36,200
Sure.

3133
02:06:38,140 --> 02:06:38,900
Why not?

3134
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:40,740
It is like a fucking deal!

3135
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:43,060
A good bargain, chat.

3136
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:48,060
It is actually like a hundred percent an absolute steal.

3137
02:06:50,900 --> 02:06:53,040
Guys, but what about the stress blood?

3138
02:06:53,320 --> 02:06:54,200
The stress oil?

3139
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:56,980
Think about the stress oil!

3140
02:06:59,360 --> 02:06:59,720
Chat.

3141
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:02,360
You wanna be stressed forever?

3142
02:07:03,180 --> 02:07:04,960
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3143
02:07:06,680 --> 02:07:07,400
Hehehehehehe.

3144
02:07:08,900 --> 02:07:09,620
Hehehehehehe.

3145
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:12,980
Guys, I am literally a professional!

3146
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:17,300
He's this way.

3147
02:07:18,180 --> 02:07:20,500
I am a professional too, chat!

3148
02:07:20,940 --> 02:07:23,280
Your head is in good hands.

3149
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:25,280
That's actually...

3150
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:28,180
Like, look at all my happy clients!

3151
02:07:28,640 --> 02:07:29,240
Guys.

3152
02:07:31,220 --> 02:07:32,100
God, where are we?

3153
02:07:32,180 --> 02:07:32,840
Arlo, please.

3154
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:35,660
Wait, where do I go?

3155
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:39,060
Did I walk the wrong way?

3156
02:07:41,100 --> 02:07:42,400
You have come...

3157
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:43,700
Like, I literally...

3158
02:07:43,700 --> 02:07:44,100
Okay.

3159
02:07:44,420 --> 02:07:45,020
Alright.

3160
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:48,780
Like, these... my clients were so fucking relaxed...

3161
02:07:48,780 --> 02:07:50,320
That they like...

3162
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:54,300
They left... they like... started surrounding me after I...

3163
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:55,360
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3164
02:07:56,620 --> 02:07:57,220
Hehehehehehe.

3165
02:07:57,700 --> 02:08:01,300
They were so relaxed that they visit me when I am asleep.

3166
02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:04,060
That's how good of a client I am.

3167
02:08:04,300 --> 02:08:04,860
Alright.

3168
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:07,220
That's how good of a fucking...

3169
02:08:07,940 --> 02:08:08,400
Uh...

3170
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:10,540
Massage therapist I am.

3171
02:08:14,570 --> 02:08:15,230
Let's see.

3172
02:08:15,310 --> 02:08:16,250
It has to be like here.

3173
02:08:17,150 --> 02:08:17,610
Right?

3174
02:08:18,510 --> 02:08:20,630
Well, I don't have the sun anymore to help me.

3175
02:08:20,670 --> 02:08:22,030
So, I assume it is.

3176
02:08:23,130 --> 02:08:25,290
I assume it's like in this area.

3177
02:08:27,170 --> 02:08:29,030
Yeah, they entered a deep sleep.

3178
02:08:30,890 --> 02:08:33,070
They've never been as relaxed as I...

3179
02:08:33,070 --> 02:08:35,150
As I've made them.

3180
02:08:35,970 --> 02:08:36,430
Hehehehehehe.

3181
02:08:36,430 --> 02:08:37,550
Oh, is that shrine?

3182
02:08:39,110 --> 02:08:40,750
Oh, I have to dive, right?

3183
02:08:43,550 --> 02:08:45,030
I have to dive down here?

3184
02:08:47,830 --> 02:08:49,810
I have to swim down here.

3185
02:08:49,870 --> 02:08:50,110
Yeah.

3186
02:08:52,250 --> 02:08:52,790
Booooom.

3187
02:08:54,970 --> 02:08:56,530
It's not eternal sleep.

3188
02:08:56,710 --> 02:08:57,730
It's just sleep sleep.

3189
02:08:58,630 --> 02:08:59,490
That's different.

3190
02:09:00,770 --> 02:09:01,950
Is it this way?

3191
02:09:02,330 --> 02:09:03,130
Can't tell.

3192
02:09:03,650 --> 02:09:04,890
The sword was gone.

3193
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:11,160
I hope I'm going the right way.

3194
02:09:16,450 --> 02:09:17,550
Where am I?

3195
02:09:18,850 --> 02:09:19,490
Hahahahaha.

3196
02:09:21,430 --> 02:09:22,070
I...

3197
02:09:22,550 --> 02:09:23,430
I hope...

3198
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:25,810
I hope I'm going the right way.

3199
02:09:26,690 --> 02:09:27,770
One fear.

3200
02:09:29,610 --> 02:09:30,670
The fuck?

3201
02:09:30,930 --> 02:09:31,530
How do I...

3202
02:09:31,530 --> 02:09:32,970
I'm strapped.

3203
02:09:37,460 --> 02:09:38,660
I'm so trapped.

3204
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:40,720
Where do I go?

3205
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:41,700
Oh!

3206
02:09:41,900 --> 02:09:42,480
A cloud.

3207
02:09:43,320 --> 02:09:43,960
Okay.

3208
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:45,100
Climb time.

3209
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:46,220
Climb.

3210
02:09:46,940 --> 02:09:47,540
Climb.

3211
02:09:47,860 --> 02:09:48,460
Climb.

3212
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:48,980
Climb.

3213
02:09:48,980 --> 02:09:49,340
Climb.

3214
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:50,160
Climb.

3215
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:51,520
Climb.

3216
02:09:52,340 --> 02:09:52,940
Climb.

3217
02:09:52,940 --> 02:09:53,080
Climb.

3218
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:55,000
Alright, let's see if the colossus is here.

3219
02:09:55,660 --> 02:09:56,720
Is it here?

3220
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:00,280
God hasn't told me anything yet...

3221
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:03,040
God?

3222
02:10:03,340 --> 02:10:03,960
Am I...

3223
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:05,120
Am I at the right area?

3224
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:05,200
Are you?

3225
02:10:05,480 --> 02:10:06,340
I am!

3226
02:10:06,700 --> 02:10:07,840
Thank you, God!

3227
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:14,020
I knew it.

3228
02:10:14,020 --> 02:10:16,800
Thank you, God, for telling me where to go.

3229
02:10:18,120 --> 02:10:19,380
Oh, it's a bird!

3230
02:10:20,500 --> 02:10:22,060
It's a bird colossus.

3231
02:10:26,870 --> 02:10:29,030
God, it's tired of me.

3232
02:10:29,730 --> 02:10:30,750
Hello, God.

3233
02:10:32,870 --> 02:10:34,070
Oh, he's so cool.

3234
02:10:34,330 --> 02:10:35,430
I love the design.

3235
02:10:37,810 --> 02:10:39,330
The design's really pretty.

3236
02:10:41,190 --> 02:10:42,430
Wait, this one's difficult?

3237
02:10:42,910 --> 02:10:43,390
No.

3238
02:10:44,290 --> 02:10:45,370
What do I do?

3239
02:10:45,850 --> 02:10:46,650
Can I die?

3240
02:10:47,730 --> 02:10:48,550
No, I'm okay.

3241
02:10:49,710 --> 02:10:53,510
Alright, I think I have to go somewhere, right?

3242
02:10:55,550 --> 02:10:56,210
Don't worry.

3243
02:10:56,630 --> 02:10:58,430
I do not swim very fast.

3244
02:10:58,610 --> 02:10:59,350
Give me a sec.

3245
02:11:02,690 --> 02:11:04,450
I am trying my best.

3246
02:11:05,710 --> 02:11:07,010
Yeah, it reminds me of the...

3247
02:11:07,450 --> 02:11:08,430
the crow Pokemon.

3248
02:11:09,310 --> 02:11:10,350
In, uh...

3249
02:11:10,930 --> 02:11:12,390
Yeah, it reminds me of the crow Pokemon.

3250
02:11:14,770 --> 02:11:15,290
Alright.

3251
02:11:16,670 --> 02:11:17,730
Don't worry, crow.

3252
02:11:21,050 --> 02:11:21,750
Don't worry.

3253
02:11:22,850 --> 02:11:25,130
I haven't massaged your crow before.

3254
02:11:25,690 --> 02:11:28,990
But I think it's the same anatomy as a person.

3255
02:11:30,610 --> 02:11:32,430
It can't be that different.

3256
02:11:32,690 --> 02:11:33,670
A head is a head.

3257
02:11:36,010 --> 02:11:37,070
There's a brain.

3258
02:11:38,910 --> 02:11:40,030
Did you see me?

3259
02:11:40,370 --> 02:11:41,450
Did you see me?

3260
02:11:41,570 --> 02:11:42,170
I'm friendly!

3261
02:11:42,890 --> 02:11:44,290
The horse sent me!

3262
02:11:44,810 --> 02:11:46,010
Diesel's still alive!

3263
02:11:50,130 --> 02:11:51,990
The horse sent me!

3264
02:11:52,010 --> 02:11:52,710
He's still alive!

3265
02:11:52,910 --> 02:11:53,650
I'm friendly!

3266
02:11:55,150 --> 02:11:56,350
What's your weak point?

3267
02:11:56,930 --> 02:11:57,530
Head?

3268
02:11:57,850 --> 02:11:59,190
I assume it's the head.

3269
02:12:00,030 --> 02:12:01,570
Okay, let's see...

3270
02:12:03,670 --> 02:12:05,710
Ooh, the music is really nice though.

3271
02:12:12,390 --> 02:12:18,510
Alright, let's see... I'm gonna have to swim over- I don't know how to swim to him or something.

3272
02:12:22,510 --> 02:12:24,250
It's like there's so many...

3273
02:12:24,990 --> 02:12:26,150
There's so many pillars.

3274
02:12:26,630 --> 02:12:28,010
Do I swim to him?

3275
02:12:29,970 --> 02:12:31,570
Alright, I'm gonna say hi!

3276
02:12:32,450 --> 02:12:34,290
Don't do anything dumb!

3277
02:12:35,190 --> 02:12:35,670
Hey!

3278
02:12:36,050 --> 02:12:36,130
Hey!

3279
02:12:36,130 --> 02:12:36,510
Hey!

3280
02:12:40,990 --> 02:12:42,350
Hello bird!

3281
02:12:43,210 --> 02:12:44,330
I'm friendly!

3282
02:12:44,870 --> 02:12:46,290
I'm so friendly!

3283
02:12:46,690 --> 02:12:48,230
All your friends like me!

3284
02:12:53,210 --> 02:12:55,890
I'm just here to give you a nice massage!

3285
02:12:56,550 --> 02:12:58,250
And some acupuncture!

3286
02:12:58,570 --> 02:13:01,830
And like letting some extra stress oil out of your head!

3287
02:13:05,350 --> 02:13:05,970
Oh, okay.

3288
02:13:06,690 --> 02:13:07,670
Don't worry.

3289
02:13:09,310 --> 02:13:10,630
I'm in the water.

3290
02:13:10,710 --> 02:13:11,130
I can't...

3291
02:13:12,850 --> 02:13:14,870
Give me a secro!

3292
02:13:16,230 --> 02:13:18,870
I need to go back onto the wall!

3293
02:13:20,250 --> 02:13:21,550
Oh my god.

3294
02:13:21,570 --> 02:13:23,330
I feel like I'm fucking drowning.

3295
02:13:23,710 --> 02:13:31,190
Like the way he fucking swims, it looks like I'm actually drowning.

3296
02:13:33,970 --> 02:13:35,070
Thank you, God.

3297
02:13:35,070 --> 02:13:38,810
I can always count on you to backseat me, God.

3298
02:13:42,010 --> 02:13:42,690
Alright.

3299
02:13:43,030 --> 02:13:43,510
Crew!

3300
02:13:47,830 --> 02:13:49,090
You see me?

3301
02:13:50,430 --> 02:13:51,370
Yes, me!

3302
02:13:52,150 --> 02:13:53,590
Are we gonna be okay?

3303
02:13:54,270 --> 02:13:54,950
Woah!

3304
02:13:56,570 --> 02:13:57,250
Nice.

3305
02:14:00,090 --> 02:14:00,770
Nice.

3306
02:14:01,270 --> 02:14:02,750
Oh, not nice!

3307
02:14:03,030 --> 02:14:04,050
Not nice!

3308
02:14:06,590 --> 02:14:07,070
God!

3309
02:14:07,070 --> 02:14:07,910
What do I do?

3310
02:14:09,090 --> 02:14:09,810
Oh, God.

3311
02:14:10,010 --> 02:14:10,790
What the fuck?

3312
02:14:10,810 --> 02:14:11,990
I can't climb that.

3313
02:14:14,710 --> 02:14:15,590
Oh, no.

3314
02:14:15,710 --> 02:14:16,390
Oh, no.

3315
02:14:16,450 --> 02:14:16,970
Come on!

3316
02:14:17,410 --> 02:14:18,390
Come on, kid!

3317
02:14:19,770 --> 02:14:20,250
Kid!

3318
02:14:22,690 --> 02:14:23,550
Climb up!

3319
02:14:24,030 --> 02:14:25,090
Okay, there we go.

3320
02:14:26,070 --> 02:14:27,450
Thank fucking God.

3321
02:14:30,870 --> 02:14:31,830
Kid, please.

3322
02:14:32,330 --> 02:14:34,830
For the love of God, just get on his back.

3323
02:14:34,830 --> 02:14:36,190
I need a recharge.

3324
02:14:36,650 --> 02:14:38,930
Kid, you're not... you're not getting younger!

3325
02:14:39,870 --> 02:14:41,710
Your stamina is lowering!

3326
02:14:41,950 --> 02:14:42,390
Okay, nice.

3327
02:14:42,490 --> 02:14:42,910
Okay, nice.

3328
02:14:42,970 --> 02:14:43,210
Okay.

3329
02:14:43,330 --> 02:14:44,090
Okay, we're good.

3330
02:14:44,170 --> 02:14:44,410
We're good.

3331
02:14:44,510 --> 02:14:44,690
We're good.

3332
02:14:44,750 --> 02:14:45,170
We're good.

3333
02:14:45,310 --> 02:14:45,770
Oh!

3334
02:14:46,210 --> 02:14:46,890
Get me down!

3335
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:51,790
I didn't mean to do that.

3336
02:14:54,370 --> 02:14:57,070
Where the fuck is your weak point?

3337
02:15:00,610 --> 02:15:01,330
Oh, God.

3338
02:15:01,990 --> 02:15:02,770
Oh, God.

3339
02:15:06,950 --> 02:15:07,890
Where is it?

3340
02:15:09,110 --> 02:15:10,150
Where is it?

3341
02:15:10,170 --> 02:15:11,250
Where is it pointing to?

3342
02:15:11,310 --> 02:15:12,070
Oh, it's on the wing!

3343
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:12,850
It's the wing!

3344
02:15:12,990 --> 02:15:13,730
It's the left wing!

3345
02:15:13,850 --> 02:15:14,610
I figured it out!

3346
02:15:15,290 --> 02:15:16,490
It's the left wing!

3347
02:15:16,870 --> 02:15:17,330
Okay.

3348
02:15:18,190 --> 02:15:18,670
Okay.

3349
02:15:18,930 --> 02:15:19,790
Just run.

3350
02:15:20,710 --> 02:15:22,110
Just fucking run!

3351
02:15:22,530 --> 02:15:23,010
Okay.

3352
02:15:26,690 --> 02:15:27,170
Okay.

3353
02:15:28,210 --> 02:15:28,730
We're fine.

3354
02:15:30,270 --> 02:15:31,230
Oh, please.

3355
02:15:32,190 --> 02:15:33,870
Please, just grab onto it.

3356
02:15:33,910 --> 02:15:34,670
He has to glide.

3357
02:15:34,670 --> 02:15:35,470
He has to glide one time.

3358
02:15:37,490 --> 02:15:37,850
Alright.

3359
02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:39,390
Nice.

3360
02:15:39,570 --> 02:15:40,270
We're just gonna run.

3361
02:15:40,350 --> 02:15:40,870
We're just gonna run.

3362
02:15:41,030 --> 02:15:41,450
There you go.

3363
02:15:41,610 --> 02:15:42,230
There you go.

3364
02:15:42,510 --> 02:15:43,130
Oh, my God.

3365
02:15:43,170 --> 02:15:44,670
You're putting too much stress on the wing!

3366
02:15:45,310 --> 02:15:47,850
You're putting way too much stress on the wing!

3367
02:15:51,990 --> 02:15:52,350
Stop!

3368
02:15:54,290 --> 02:15:54,870
Oh, God.

3369
02:15:54,930 --> 02:15:55,270
Oh, God.

3370
02:15:55,270 --> 02:15:55,570
Oh, God.

3371
02:15:55,570 --> 02:15:56,770
Oh, my God.

3372
02:15:56,870 --> 02:15:57,250
Oh, okay.

3373
02:15:57,350 --> 02:15:57,670
There you go.

3374
02:15:58,210 --> 02:15:58,750
There you go.

3375
02:15:59,470 --> 02:15:59,830
Okay.

3376
02:15:59,950 --> 02:16:01,530
I should not have given it a little poke.

3377
02:16:01,990 --> 02:16:03,610
The poke might have been too tiny.

3378
02:16:05,690 --> 02:16:06,650
Oh, no!

3379
02:16:06,790 --> 02:16:07,570
Come on!

3380
02:16:08,510 --> 02:16:08,990
Yes!

3381
02:16:09,430 --> 02:16:09,910
Alright.

3382
02:16:10,610 --> 02:16:11,270
Oh, no.

3383
02:16:11,390 --> 02:16:12,730
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

3384
02:16:12,830 --> 02:16:13,390
Turn around!

3385
02:16:13,470 --> 02:16:14,030
Turn around!

3386
02:16:14,210 --> 02:16:14,750
Turn around!

3387
02:16:14,910 --> 02:16:15,390
Turn around!

3388
02:16:15,710 --> 02:16:16,130
Woo!

3389
02:16:17,130 --> 02:16:17,610
Woo!

3390
02:16:18,050 --> 02:16:18,530
Woo!

3391
02:16:18,730 --> 02:16:19,210
Woo!

3392
02:16:19,390 --> 02:16:19,390
What?

3393
02:16:19,390 --> 02:16:19,730
No!

3394
02:16:21,230 --> 02:16:23,990
He fucking pushed me off.

3395
02:16:24,910 --> 02:16:26,170
I'm so sad.

3396
02:16:29,370 --> 02:16:31,130
He pushed me off.

3397
02:16:31,650 --> 02:16:33,870
He has to fly back to me, right?

3398
02:16:34,810 --> 02:16:35,590
Come on!

3399
02:16:37,310 --> 02:16:38,790
Maybe I can, like...

3400
02:16:39,770 --> 02:16:41,390
Maybe I can, like...

3401
02:16:42,170 --> 02:16:43,950
If he'll fly back, right?

3402
02:16:46,090 --> 02:16:47,170
Bird, come back!

3403
02:16:49,010 --> 02:16:50,310
Come on, birdie!

3404
02:16:52,310 --> 02:16:53,070
Come on!

3405
02:16:55,430 --> 02:16:55,990
Just...

3406
02:16:56,610 --> 02:16:58,390
I'm just here to give you some therapy.

3407
02:17:00,710 --> 02:17:01,950
You know the drill!

3408
02:17:02,310 --> 02:17:03,690
He's just looking at me.

3409
02:17:04,810 --> 02:17:05,610
Oh, okay.

3410
02:17:05,750 --> 02:17:06,530
You gonna...

3411
02:17:06,530 --> 02:17:07,590
You gonna be okay?

3412
02:17:12,860 --> 02:17:13,700
Look, man.

3413
02:17:13,740 --> 02:17:16,120
You're really fucking tense, bro.

3414
02:17:17,420 --> 02:17:17,940
Oh.

3415
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:18,640
Oh.

3416
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:19,640
Yes!

3417
02:17:19,900 --> 02:17:20,500
I grabbed it.

3418
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:23,500
Can I go up?

3419
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:25,720
Okay.

3420
02:17:26,680 --> 02:17:27,900
Alright, he's coming over.

3421
02:17:28,700 --> 02:17:29,220
Alright.

3422
02:17:29,300 --> 02:17:29,720
Nice.

3423
02:17:30,860 --> 02:17:32,580
I need to make sure...

3424
02:17:34,540 --> 02:17:35,060
Oh!

3425
02:17:35,060 --> 02:17:35,580
Oh!

3426
02:17:37,580 --> 02:17:37,820
Alright.

3427
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:38,480
Stop.

3428
02:17:38,780 --> 02:17:39,340
Please.

3429
02:17:39,400 --> 02:17:40,580
We have to be centered.

3430
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:42,120
We have to be...

3431
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:42,760
You need to relax!

3432
02:17:43,360 --> 02:17:45,780
When was the last time you stopped flying?

3433
02:17:46,780 --> 02:17:48,820
You know, birds don't have...

3434
02:17:48,820 --> 02:17:48,980
Wait.

3435
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:50,080
There's no stress point here.

3436
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:51,400
No!

3437
02:17:52,340 --> 02:17:55,180
Why did I jump?

3438
02:17:55,780 --> 02:17:56,340
I...

3439
02:17:58,120 --> 02:18:00,220
I don't know why I jumped.

3440
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:00,740
I...

3441
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:04,860
That was an accident.

3442
02:18:05,900 --> 02:18:08,000
That was a little oopsie.

3443
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,800
There was no stress point!

3444
02:18:10,300 --> 02:18:11,720
Where was it?

3445
02:18:13,340 --> 02:18:13,900
Okay.

3446
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:17,180
I was so confused!

3447
02:18:18,960 --> 02:18:21,060
Oh, you need the sword out?

3448
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:22,140
I'm so...

3449
02:18:22,140 --> 02:18:22,840
Oh my god.

3450
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:27,880
Why can't I just like fucking poke it with my arrow?

3451
02:18:28,220 --> 02:18:29,360
It's the same thing.

3452
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:30,700
It's both pointy.

3453
02:18:32,900 --> 02:18:34,480
It's literally the same thing.

3454
02:18:34,620 --> 02:18:35,860
It's literally the same thing.

3455
02:18:35,940 --> 02:18:36,880
Both pointy.

3456
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:38,880
You see me?

3457
02:18:43,170 --> 02:18:44,370
I know you see me.

3458
02:18:44,470 --> 02:18:45,490
You can't ignore me forever.

3459
02:18:47,530 --> 02:18:49,070
You can't ignore me forever.

3460
02:18:50,230 --> 02:18:50,950
Alright, nice.

3461
02:18:52,770 --> 02:18:53,250
Alright.

3462
02:18:56,900 --> 02:18:58,920
Okay, let me go to the other one.

3463
02:19:01,580 --> 02:19:02,400
Let me...

3464
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:03,380
Let me go...

3465
02:19:03,380 --> 02:19:04,480
Alright, there you go.

3466
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:06,040
You have to come back, right?

3467
02:19:07,460 --> 02:19:08,760
There we go.

3468
02:19:10,100 --> 02:19:10,580
Alright.

3469
02:19:11,020 --> 02:19:11,860
Why can't I...

3470
02:19:11,860 --> 02:19:13,320
Why can't I have a magic bow too?

3471
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:14,840
God bless my bow!

3472
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:22,660
God, I need you to bless my other weapon.

3473
02:19:22,880 --> 02:19:23,840
This is not fair.

3474
02:19:24,460 --> 02:19:25,900
This is not fair!

3475
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:32,080
Alright, I need you to come back.

3476
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:33,060
I need...

3477
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:38,500
I need you to come back, sir.

3478
02:19:39,540 --> 02:19:40,100
Sir.

3479
02:19:40,680 --> 02:19:43,840
You're not gonna like the bell when I send it to you.

3480
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:50,860
Look, even if you don't like this treatment, it is for the sake of longevity.

3481
02:19:52,200 --> 02:19:54,060
It's so you can live longer.

3482
02:19:56,140 --> 02:19:57,940
Don't you wanna live longer?

3483
02:19:58,380 --> 02:20:00,960
All that stress is not good for your heart.

3484
02:20:01,140 --> 02:20:03,000
Why do you have a heart attack while flying?

3485
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:06,380
What do you do?

3486
02:20:07,540 --> 02:20:08,640
Okay, let's...

3487
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:09,940
Poke him.

3488
02:20:10,500 --> 02:20:11,660
Gotta poke him.

3489
02:20:14,860 --> 02:20:15,560
Alright.

3490
02:20:16,320 --> 02:20:17,440
Got my sword.

3491
02:20:19,220 --> 02:20:20,320
Bird, come down.

3492
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:21,700
Bird!

3493
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:23,880
There's no fucking...

3494
02:20:23,880 --> 02:20:26,520
There's no bargains for this.

3495
02:20:27,220 --> 02:20:28,360
Oh shit!

3496
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:29,340
XFL.

3497
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:31,140
Where did he go?

3498
02:20:31,900 --> 02:20:32,600
Bird!

3499
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:35,960
Am I on the wrong platform?

3500
02:20:36,700 --> 02:20:37,400
No.

3501
02:20:38,220 --> 02:20:39,460
This is the right one.

3502
02:20:40,220 --> 02:20:40,940
This is it.

3503
02:20:41,340 --> 02:20:41,980
Come down.

3504
02:20:42,060 --> 02:20:43,140
I know you wanna do this.

3505
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:44,100
That's right.

3506
02:20:46,140 --> 02:20:47,540
There's no coupon code!

3507
02:20:49,900 --> 02:20:50,380
Alright.

3508
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:51,040
Nice.

3509
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:54,280
Okay.

3510
02:20:54,680 --> 02:20:56,780
I need to fucking head over to the...

3511
02:20:56,780 --> 02:20:57,120
God.

3512
02:20:57,340 --> 02:20:58,180
Dude, this...

3513
02:20:58,180 --> 02:21:00,260
Why is this so difficult?

3514
02:21:03,020 --> 02:21:03,840
Oh no.

3515
02:21:04,300 --> 02:21:05,240
I don't like this.

3516
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:06,160
Okay.

3517
02:21:06,780 --> 02:21:07,260
Alright.

3518
02:21:07,380 --> 02:21:08,000
Come on.

3519
02:21:08,020 --> 02:21:08,220
No!

3520
02:21:09,900 --> 02:21:11,720
I keep getting greedy!

3521
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:13,680
I'm going for the tail.

3522
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:14,420
Fuck this.

3523
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:16,180
No.

3524
02:21:16,180 --> 02:21:16,520
No.

3525
02:21:16,620 --> 02:21:16,760
No.

3526
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:16,920
No.

3527
02:21:16,920 --> 02:21:17,100
No.

3528
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:17,220
No.

3529
02:21:17,220 --> 02:21:17,280
No.

3530
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:17,400
No.

3531
02:21:17,400 --> 02:21:17,480
No.

3532
02:21:17,480 --> 02:21:17,600
No.

3533
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:18,100
No.

3534
02:21:18,460 --> 02:21:18,960
No.

3535
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:20,420
No.

3536
02:21:20,420 --> 02:21:21,340
Hold on to it!

3537
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:24,120
You have buff arms!

3538
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:25,560
There you go.

3539
02:21:26,420 --> 02:21:26,980
There you go.

3540
02:21:27,140 --> 02:21:27,640
I gave up.

3541
02:21:27,660 --> 02:21:28,300
I'm gonna go for the wing.

3542
02:21:28,420 --> 02:21:29,580
I'm not gonna risk it.

3543
02:21:30,320 --> 02:21:31,440
I'm not gonna risk it.

3544
02:21:31,460 --> 02:21:32,100
I'm not gonna risk it.

3545
02:21:32,120 --> 02:21:32,540
There you go.

3546
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:33,260
There you go.

3547
02:21:35,420 --> 02:21:35,860
Nice!

3548
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:37,440
Oh, thank God!

3549
02:21:37,560 --> 02:21:37,900
Okay.

3550
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:39,380
Oh my God.

3551
02:21:39,400 --> 02:21:40,340
Look at all the stress oil.

3552
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:43,380
Look at all the stress oil.

3553
02:21:43,420 --> 02:21:44,340
You're gonna thank me later!

3554
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:48,280
Flying is gonna be so easy after I'm done!

3555
02:21:49,420 --> 02:21:49,860
Trust!

3556
02:21:49,960 --> 02:21:50,400
Trust!

3557
02:21:50,980 --> 02:21:51,600
Oh God.

3558
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:52,200
Oh God.

3559
02:21:52,300 --> 02:21:52,580
No!

3560
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:53,960
Oh!

3561
02:21:54,420 --> 02:21:54,780
Please!

3562
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:55,640
No!

3563
02:21:57,540 --> 02:21:58,440
No, no, no, no, no, no!

3564
02:21:58,900 --> 02:21:59,260
No!

3565
02:22:02,660 --> 02:22:03,540
Let me back up!

3566
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:04,180
Let me back up!

3567
02:22:04,200 --> 02:22:04,900
Let me back up!

3568
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:05,640
Let me back up!

3569
02:22:05,660 --> 02:22:06,700
Just let me fucking...

3570
02:22:06,700 --> 02:22:08,000
Oh God.

3571
02:22:08,240 --> 02:22:08,600
No!

3572
02:22:09,660 --> 02:22:10,360
Please be...

3573
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:11,120
Please be water!

3574
02:22:11,800 --> 02:22:12,160
Okay.

3575
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:12,660
It's water.

3576
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:14,620
It's water.

3577
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:16,720
Yeah, it's the stress oil.

3578
02:22:16,740 --> 02:22:20,200
You know like when you squeeze your face and all the oil comes out?

3579
02:22:20,260 --> 02:22:20,400
Yeah.

3580
02:22:20,420 --> 02:22:21,620
That's what I'm doing right now.

3581
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:24,740
I'm just squeezing really, really hard.

3582
02:22:30,060 --> 02:22:31,180
That's what I'm doing.

3583
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:36,440
Alright.

3584
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:37,400
Where is he?

3585
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:39,200
Where the fuck is he?

3586
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:43,020
Wait, where did he go?

3587
02:22:43,160 --> 02:22:43,760
He disappeared.

3588
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:47,120
I actually don't know where he is.

3589
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:50,240
Where the fuck is the...

3590
02:22:50,240 --> 02:22:50,400
Oh, there he is.

3591
02:22:50,420 --> 02:22:51,040
Bird.

3592
02:22:52,980 --> 02:22:53,500
Bird.

3593
02:22:55,320 --> 02:22:55,840
Bird.

3594
02:22:59,540 --> 02:23:00,060
Bird.

3595
02:23:00,300 --> 02:23:00,400
Bird.

3596
02:23:00,540 --> 02:23:01,580
Get down here.

3597
02:23:04,040 --> 02:23:04,560
Please.

3598
02:23:05,180 --> 02:23:06,780
You have too many wings.

3599
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:08,600
Please.

3600
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:09,620
I have two.

3601
02:23:10,140 --> 02:23:11,200
Bird, please!

3602
02:23:12,060 --> 02:23:12,580
Please!

3603
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:14,400
I know you see me.

3604
02:23:14,440 --> 02:23:15,200
Your eyes are red.

3605
02:23:15,400 --> 02:23:17,220
I know you acknowledge my existence.

3606
02:23:19,020 --> 02:23:19,700
That's right.

3607
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:20,200
That's right.

3608
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:20,480
Okay.

3609
02:23:20,840 --> 02:23:21,600
Here we go.

3610
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:21,960
And...

3611
02:23:21,980 --> 02:23:22,920
Jump!

3612
02:23:23,540 --> 02:23:24,280
There you go.

3613
02:23:24,860 --> 02:23:27,960
I hate that I grab onto it first and I don't move.

3614
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:29,420
That shit is so frustrating.

3615
02:23:30,280 --> 02:23:31,560
Oh my god.

3616
02:23:31,620 --> 02:23:35,280
He is like the most frustrating boss!

3617
02:23:39,820 --> 02:23:41,720
He's actually so frustrating.

3618
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:43,460
Oh my god.

3619
02:23:44,060 --> 02:23:44,640
Please.

3620
02:23:47,960 --> 02:23:48,540
Okay.

3621
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:51,280
Okay, nice.

3622
02:23:51,420 --> 02:23:51,960
Okay.

3623
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:53,720
Alright.

3624
02:23:54,100 --> 02:23:54,900
Another hit.

3625
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:58,800
Alright, just doing a little barrel roll.

3626
02:23:58,960 --> 02:23:59,760
But we're okay.

3627
02:23:59,860 --> 02:24:00,340
We're fine.

3628
02:24:00,580 --> 02:24:01,260
We're fine.

3629
02:24:01,340 --> 02:24:02,340
There's no more stress.

3630
02:24:02,540 --> 02:24:02,920
Look, see?

3631
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:04,100
You're less stressed now!

3632
02:24:05,260 --> 02:24:06,580
You're less STRONG!

3633
02:24:09,100 --> 02:24:10,580
We're going to the back of the wing.

3634
02:24:10,960 --> 02:24:13,300
We're going to the back of the wing now.

3635
02:24:13,720 --> 02:24:16,060
I'd rather deal with the wing stress here.

3636
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:19,140
Oh god.

3637
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:19,760
Oh god.

3638
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:20,480
Please go up.

3639
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:20,980
Please go up.

3640
02:24:23,260 --> 02:24:23,820
Alright.

3641
02:24:23,940 --> 02:24:24,700
Oh my god!

3642
02:24:24,740 --> 02:24:26,400
Look at all the stress points!

3643
02:24:27,980 --> 02:24:28,720
Don't worry.

3644
02:24:29,300 --> 02:24:30,940
Dr. Doki is here.

3645
02:24:31,240 --> 02:24:33,520
The doctor is my first name.

3646
02:24:40,900 --> 02:24:43,080
It's not the medical time of doctor.

3647
02:24:43,160 --> 02:24:44,440
That's just my first name.

3648
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:47,680
Okay.

3649
02:24:48,660 --> 02:24:50,260
Thank fucking god.

3650
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:50,960
Oh, I shouldn't have...

3651
02:24:50,960 --> 02:24:52,000
I shouldn't just do the little pokes.

3652
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:54,080
I should actually hold my sword up.

3653
02:24:54,800 --> 02:24:55,880
Oh no.

3654
02:24:55,940 --> 02:24:57,000
One more wing.

3655
02:24:57,860 --> 02:24:58,460
No!

3656
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:00,400
Okay, we're fine.

3657
02:25:00,620 --> 02:25:02,080
We're just balancing ourselves.

3658
02:25:03,020 --> 02:25:05,140
We're fighting against the wind here.

3659
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:08,340
Dr. Doki.

3660
02:25:09,260 --> 02:25:11,500
My first name is doctor.

3661
02:25:11,940 --> 02:25:14,100
My middle name is professor.

3662
02:25:14,680 --> 02:25:15,780
And then...

3663
02:25:17,500 --> 02:25:18,560
And then...

3664
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:20,700
My last name is Doki.

3665
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:20,940
And then...

3666
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:21,920
So...

3667
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:24,540
So I'm Dr. Professor Doki.

3668
02:25:24,920 --> 02:25:26,520
So I'm almost licensed.

3669
02:25:26,860 --> 02:25:27,300
You know?

3670
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:30,860
It's almost like being licensed.

3671
02:25:33,180 --> 02:25:35,240
Because it's like recognized by the government.

3672
02:25:36,500 --> 02:25:37,460
God, please.

3673
02:25:38,020 --> 02:25:38,620
Please!

3674
02:25:38,700 --> 02:25:40,220
Show me the other wing!

3675
02:25:40,540 --> 02:25:42,520
Show me the other wing right now.

3676
02:25:43,300 --> 02:25:44,220
Alright, here we go.

3677
02:25:46,180 --> 02:25:46,780
Alright.

3678
02:25:48,500 --> 02:25:49,100
Stop!

3679
02:25:49,460 --> 02:25:50,920
Oh god, this one was so close.

3680
02:25:50,920 --> 02:25:51,140
That's the hardest.

3681
02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:56,020
Paging Dr. Professor Doki.

3682
02:26:05,230 --> 02:26:07,750
I show you my wing.

3683
02:26:07,850 --> 02:26:08,430
Please respond.

3684
02:26:11,330 --> 02:26:12,110
Yay!

3685
02:26:14,390 --> 02:26:15,570
Licensed upgrade.

3686
02:26:15,950 --> 02:26:18,210
Now I charge $150 an hour.

3687
02:26:19,290 --> 02:26:20,890
I'm getting like...

3688
02:26:22,230 --> 02:26:23,010
Wait.

3689
02:26:24,210 --> 02:26:24,610
I can't catch me.

3690
02:26:24,810 --> 02:26:27,810
The shadows can't catch me if I swim under.

3691
02:26:29,330 --> 02:26:30,810
Wait, where is the shadow?

3692
02:26:32,050 --> 02:26:33,190
Oh nevermind.

3693
02:26:34,070 --> 02:26:35,430
Guess I drowned.

3694
02:26:38,550 --> 02:26:40,130
He's so relaxed now.

3695
02:26:40,230 --> 02:26:41,750
He went back to the sea.

3696
02:26:42,030 --> 02:26:43,830
He returned to the ocean.

3697
02:26:45,410 --> 02:26:47,070
That's how relaxed he is.

3698
02:26:54,900 --> 02:26:56,680
He like devolved.

3699
02:26:57,520 --> 02:26:59,800
When you're so relaxed, you just devolved.

3700
02:27:08,810 --> 02:27:09,570
Yay!

3701
02:27:09,570 --> 02:27:11,750
That's where I'm gonna put my toilet.

3702
02:27:27,960 --> 02:27:29,500
I'm doing it, guys!

3703
02:27:30,900 --> 02:27:34,200
I'm becoming a master massage therapist!

3704
02:27:37,160 --> 02:27:40,360
Oh, is a giant lurking underneath the temple?

3705
02:27:46,720 --> 02:27:48,780
But, well, it is not.

3706
02:27:56,390 --> 02:27:57,470
What kind of colossus is that?

3707
02:28:01,580 --> 02:28:03,520
I think we're making really good progress.

3708
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:05,160
I'm gonna look at my dead girlfriend now.

3709
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:08,160
Hello, dead girlfriend.

3710
02:28:09,220 --> 02:28:10,040
Don't worry.

3711
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:12,440
Apparently you're worth it.

3712
02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:13,760
I swear.

3713
02:28:14,560 --> 02:28:17,160
If you break up with me after I did all of this.

3714
02:28:20,320 --> 02:28:21,720
I swear to God.

3715
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:26,680
Okay.

3716
02:28:26,680 --> 02:28:27,620
Let me...

3717
02:28:27,620 --> 02:28:28,600
Time to go find my girlfriend.

3718
02:28:28,620 --> 02:28:33,620
Time to go find the other colossus.

3719
02:28:38,680 --> 02:28:39,970
That would be very tragic.

3720
02:28:40,170 --> 02:28:41,750
I'd feel so sorry for this kid.

3721
02:28:43,210 --> 02:28:43,910
What?

3722
02:28:44,030 --> 02:28:45,590
I don't worry, boyfriend.

3723
02:28:49,250 --> 02:28:52,050
That got so dark.

3724
02:28:52,730 --> 02:28:53,430
Alright.

3725
02:28:56,710 --> 02:28:57,850
Time to pray.

3726
02:28:59,870 --> 02:29:00,350
Pray.

3727
02:29:00,470 --> 02:29:01,590
Pray to save.

3728
02:29:04,070 --> 02:29:04,550
Alright.

3729
02:29:04,610 --> 02:29:05,230
Where do we go?

3730
02:29:05,410 --> 02:29:06,310
Arlo, where do we go?

3731
02:29:07,090 --> 02:29:07,570
Arlo!

3732
02:29:09,750 --> 02:29:10,710
We go...

3733
02:29:12,670 --> 02:29:13,630
This way.

3734
02:29:14,110 --> 02:29:14,590
Alright.

3735
02:29:17,050 --> 02:29:17,770
Alright, Arlo.

3736
02:29:18,670 --> 02:29:19,390
You know what?

3737
02:29:21,590 --> 02:29:23,070
Let us do...

3738
02:29:23,070 --> 02:29:24,850
I know this is a short stream today.

3739
02:29:25,230 --> 02:29:27,830
But I think that is a good place to stop.

3740
02:29:27,830 --> 02:29:28,330
Stop it.

3741
02:29:29,310 --> 02:29:31,410
I think six... what?

3742
02:29:31,450 --> 02:29:32,410
Five bosses?

3743
02:29:32,850 --> 02:29:35,970
I think five bosses was good progress.

3744
02:29:36,410 --> 02:29:39,570
Five bosses was pretty good progress.

3745
02:29:39,910 --> 02:29:40,930
I did pretty well.

3746
02:29:41,830 --> 02:29:42,950
I'm pretty sure.

3747
02:29:44,070 --> 02:29:48,450
Doki's massage clinic is growing.

3748
02:29:48,610 --> 02:29:49,810
And I'm very proud of.

3749
02:29:49,910 --> 02:29:54,270
I am very proud of me, the kid, and Arlo.

3750
02:29:54,970 --> 02:29:56,590
We are doing so well.

3751
02:29:56,690 --> 02:29:57,450
Aren't we, Arlo?

3752
02:29:57,450 --> 02:29:59,350
Our business is growing.

3753
02:29:59,570 --> 02:30:00,330
It's booming.

3754
02:30:00,890 --> 02:30:06,870
People are spreading the glory of Doki's massage therapy.

3755
02:30:09,650 --> 02:30:11,150
It's to die for.

3756
02:30:14,310 --> 02:30:15,530
Doki's massage clinic.

3757
02:30:15,750 --> 02:30:17,170
No, I just got it.

3758
02:30:17,210 --> 02:30:18,310
Thank you for the super chat.

3759
02:30:18,450 --> 02:30:18,770
Thank you.

3760
02:30:19,450 --> 02:30:20,510
Where are Pico?

3761
02:30:20,610 --> 02:30:21,030
Look.

3762
02:30:21,250 --> 02:30:22,710
They have... it's because like...

3763
02:30:22,710 --> 02:30:24,290
They're not stressed out yet.

3764
02:30:24,390 --> 02:30:24,870
Okay?

3765
02:30:24,930 --> 02:30:26,890
You think they're just going to be stressed out instantly?

3766
02:30:26,890 --> 02:30:27,550
Afterwards?

3767
02:30:28,250 --> 02:30:28,690
Chat?

3768
02:30:29,110 --> 02:30:30,870
It takes a while.

3769
02:30:31,290 --> 02:30:32,630
They just need to build up their...

3770
02:30:32,630 --> 02:30:36,050
They're trying to build up the oil for me to like...

3771
02:30:36,050 --> 02:30:38,590
The blood oil for me to release it.

3772
02:30:40,810 --> 02:30:42,110
Thank you for the super chat.

3773
02:30:42,170 --> 02:30:42,470
Thank you.

3774
02:30:42,490 --> 02:30:42,850
Thank you.

3775
02:30:42,850 --> 02:30:46,630
The horse is going to be called Jared by the time the last colossus is treated.

3776
02:30:46,850 --> 02:30:47,850
Thank you for the super chat.

3777
02:30:47,970 --> 02:30:48,250
Thank you.

3778
02:30:48,250 --> 02:30:48,790
Thank you.

3779
02:30:48,870 --> 02:30:49,230
Wait.

3780
02:30:50,330 --> 02:30:50,990
Did I save?

3781
02:30:51,070 --> 02:30:51,670
I saved, right?

3782
02:30:51,710 --> 02:30:52,150
By praying?

3783
02:30:52,970 --> 02:30:53,410
Yeah.

3784
02:30:53,530 --> 02:30:54,250
So I don't have to worry.

3785
02:30:54,930 --> 02:30:55,970
I don't have to worry.

3786
02:30:56,190 --> 02:30:56,750
Whoa.

3787
02:30:57,030 --> 02:30:57,470
Wait.

3788
02:30:57,610 --> 02:30:58,550
This is not the right...

3789
02:30:58,550 --> 02:30:58,730
Wait.

3790
02:30:58,790 --> 02:30:59,690
Why is it the game?

3791
02:31:04,390 --> 02:31:05,790
But what if...

3792
02:31:05,790 --> 02:31:06,810
Hey guys.

3793
02:31:06,890 --> 02:31:09,970
This is going to be the donation area now.

3794
02:31:13,610 --> 02:31:17,150
Tune in next time for Colossus Donkey.

3795
02:31:18,550 --> 02:31:19,110
Bye.

3796
02:31:19,630 --> 02:31:20,190
Bye.

3797
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:20,590
Bye.

3798
02:31:23,310 --> 02:31:23,870
Bye.

3799
02:31:23,870 --> 02:31:24,230
Bye.

3800
02:31:24,230 --> 02:31:26,130
You know what?

3801
02:31:26,130 --> 02:31:27,550
I'm fine with this being my...

3802
02:31:27,550 --> 02:31:30,030
I'm fine with this being my chatting screen.

3803
02:31:30,490 --> 02:31:31,370
This works.

3804
02:31:31,670 --> 02:31:32,990
This is so good.

3805
02:31:33,050 --> 02:31:34,090
It's been fun so far.

3806
02:31:34,350 --> 02:31:35,590
It's been fun so far.

3807
02:31:35,650 --> 02:31:49,430
I'm glad you guys are helping me not get absolutely fucking lost and helping me, helping me figure out where helping me figure out the controls is definitely very helpful.

3808
02:31:51,510 --> 02:31:52,690
It's so helpful.

3809
02:31:52,790 --> 02:31:54,150
But it's been really fun though.

3810
02:31:54,210 --> 02:31:59,050
So, it's been really fun so far.

3811
02:31:59,650 --> 02:32:00,790
Hey, what are you looking at?

3812
02:32:01,310 --> 02:32:02,510
What are you looking at, huh?

3813
02:32:06,710 --> 02:32:09,510
Yes, I wasn't as lost as I thought I was gonna be.

3814
02:32:09,810 --> 02:32:12,370
But I've definitely enjoyed it so far.

3815
02:32:12,470 --> 02:32:14,750
I can't wait to kill more Colossus.

3816
02:32:14,870 --> 02:32:17,930
Kill 16 Colossus, not 17.

3817
02:32:18,310 --> 02:32:19,890
I don't care about the hidden one.

3818
02:32:20,030 --> 02:32:21,990
The hidden one does not exist for me.

3819
02:32:21,990 --> 02:32:23,190
It's hidden for a reason.

3820
02:32:25,510 --> 02:32:28,430
I don't know if I'll ever be able to find the hidden one.

3821
02:32:29,730 --> 02:32:31,770
Oh, we're finally gonna do Super Chat reading!

3822
02:32:31,970 --> 02:32:34,710
We haven't done Super Chat reading in so long!

3823
02:32:35,350 --> 02:32:38,290
So I'm happy to be able to finally catch up on it.

3824
02:32:38,590 --> 02:32:40,010
Unless YouTube is down.

3825
02:32:40,090 --> 02:32:40,510
Okay, no.

3826
02:32:40,590 --> 02:32:40,990
Thank God.

3827
02:32:41,050 --> 02:32:41,290
Okay.

3828
02:32:41,390 --> 02:32:43,110
I was gonna say, where the fuck...

3829
02:32:44,350 --> 02:32:46,350
Where the fuck was my Super Chats?

3830
02:32:48,010 --> 02:32:48,450
Alright.

3831
02:32:48,950 --> 02:32:51,130
Don't worry, I was able to turn it on real fast.

3832
02:32:52,370 --> 02:32:52,770
Uhh...

3833
02:32:53,330 --> 02:32:53,930
Let's see.

3834
02:32:54,690 --> 02:32:56,490
Dr. Cranberry, thank you for the Super Chat.

3835
02:32:56,570 --> 02:32:57,170
Thank you, thank you.

3836
02:32:57,390 --> 02:33:01,210
Mother, I require chicken, grass, and maple leaves.

3837
02:33:01,530 --> 02:33:04,710
Please, Mother, I require sustenance.

3838
02:33:04,770 --> 02:33:05,570
Thank you for the Super Chat.

3839
02:33:05,650 --> 02:33:06,510
Thank you, thank you.

3840
02:33:06,590 --> 02:33:08,870
I'm glad you're enjoying the emotes.

3841
02:33:09,650 --> 02:33:10,730
Umm... let's see.

3842
02:33:11,150 --> 02:33:12,310
Micro, thank you for the Super Chat.

3843
02:33:12,390 --> 02:33:12,990
Thank you, thank you.

3844
02:33:13,030 --> 02:33:13,490
Hi, Doggy.

3845
02:33:13,490 --> 02:33:14,730
Congrats on the Razer sponsorship.

3846
02:33:15,070 --> 02:33:15,370
Oh!

3847
02:33:15,550 --> 02:33:16,910
It's not really a sponsorship.

3848
02:33:17,130 --> 02:33:19,210
It's more so they sent me some gifts.

3849
02:33:19,750 --> 02:33:21,890
Umm... so it's not like... it's not a sponsor.

3850
02:33:21,990 --> 02:33:26,510
It's like, uh, they just sent me some gifts, uh, and like some free products to try out.

3851
02:33:26,630 --> 02:33:28,770
So I'm not, like, sponsored by them.

3852
02:33:28,930 --> 02:33:33,050
If I am, I'll let you guys know, because it's illegal to, like, not put the hashtag.

3853
02:33:33,490 --> 02:33:33,950
Like...

3854
02:33:33,950 --> 02:33:34,610
Hahaha!

3855
02:33:36,690 --> 02:33:41,450
It's... it's illegal to not put, like, a hashtag if it was sponsored.

3856
02:33:42,550 --> 02:33:49,310
So... so it's more so, like, they just sent me some gifts to... to... uh... to try out.

3857
02:33:49,370 --> 02:33:50,250
Yeah, free is free.

3858
02:33:50,370 --> 02:33:51,370
I love free stuff.

3859
02:33:52,090 --> 02:33:57,370
Umm... but there is a sponsor this week that I'm really, really excited about.

3860
02:33:57,850 --> 02:34:00,550
Umm... it's sort of like a dream sponsor.

3861
02:34:00,810 --> 02:34:01,810
So, uh, yeah!

3862
02:34:02,570 --> 02:34:04,230
I don't know when exactly.

3863
02:34:04,550 --> 02:34:06,550
I know it's like around this week.

3864
02:34:07,170 --> 02:34:09,770
Umm... but when you see it, you'll know.

3865
02:34:10,610 --> 02:34:13,390
You'll... you'll... you'll know when you see it.

3866
02:34:14,470 --> 02:34:16,810
But... I'm super excited about it, though.

3867
02:34:16,850 --> 02:34:17,530
I'm super excited.

3868
02:34:17,590 --> 02:34:18,090
Any hints?

3869
02:34:18,170 --> 02:34:19,530
I'll just say it's like a dream sponsor.

3870
02:34:21,250 --> 02:34:22,310
Uhhhh... what else?

3871
02:34:22,570 --> 02:34:23,010
Let's see.

3872
02:34:23,630 --> 02:34:24,030
Mad!

3873
02:34:24,210 --> 02:34:24,970
Thank you for the super chat!

3874
02:34:25,090 --> 02:34:25,770
Thank you, thank you!

3875
02:34:25,830 --> 02:34:27,630
I shot Shadow of in a similar art style.

3876
02:34:27,790 --> 02:34:30,470
I thought Eldering DLC came out and got hyped for a second.

3877
02:34:30,610 --> 02:34:31,510
Thank you for the super chat!

3878
02:34:31,610 --> 02:34:32,350
Thank you, thank you!

3879
02:34:32,650 --> 02:34:34,210
Shadow of the Colossus walked.

3880
02:34:34,510 --> 02:34:35,510
So... wait, actually no.

3881
02:34:35,730 --> 02:34:36,630
Wait, actually no.

3882
02:34:36,670 --> 02:34:40,410
Demon's Souls sort of came out before Shadow of the Colossus.

3883
02:34:41,950 --> 02:34:42,350
Nevermind.

3884
02:34:42,710 --> 02:34:46,930
Uh... they both... they were both hand in hand walking together.

3885
02:34:47,430 --> 02:34:49,410
Uh... thank you for the super chat!

3886
02:34:49,530 --> 02:34:50,570
Thank you, thank you!

3887
02:34:51,590 --> 02:34:52,390
Uh... Pickle!

3888
02:34:52,470 --> 02:34:53,230
Thank you for the super chat!

3889
02:34:53,290 --> 02:34:53,970
Thank you, thank you!

3890
02:34:54,410 --> 02:34:54,810
Zachary!

3891
02:34:54,990 --> 02:34:55,950
Thank you for the super chat!

3892
02:34:56,030 --> 02:34:56,670
Thank you, thank you!

3893
02:34:56,690 --> 02:34:58,070
We're getting old, Doki.

3894
02:34:58,170 --> 02:34:58,510
Thank you!

3895
02:34:59,710 --> 02:35:00,510
Uh... nice.

3896
02:35:03,230 --> 02:35:03,630
Chimera!

3897
02:35:04,050 --> 02:35:05,110
Thank you for the super chat!

3898
02:35:05,210 --> 02:35:05,870
Thank you, thank you!

3899
02:35:05,970 --> 02:35:09,090
You say that like Dan isn't closer to 50 than Forge... Bro!

3900
02:35:09,130 --> 02:35:11,430
Like, Dan from Game Grumps?

3901
02:35:11,630 --> 02:35:14,850
He looks so fucking young...

3902
02:35:15,910 --> 02:35:18,370
Um... for like how old he is.

3903
02:35:20,110 --> 02:35:22,110
Like... it's actually crazy.

3904
02:35:22,390 --> 02:35:26,370
I remember when like... when I first started watching Game Grumps and I found out he's like...

3905
02:35:26,370 --> 02:35:27,350
Like what?

3906
02:35:27,430 --> 02:35:29,890
Like... like a lot older than Eren.

3907
02:35:30,190 --> 02:35:33,050
And then I... cause like he looked younger than him.

3908
02:35:38,450 --> 02:35:43,210
So it's actually... he has like really good genetics, that's for sure.

3909
02:35:43,490 --> 02:35:44,030
Vance!

3910
02:35:44,190 --> 02:35:45,530
Thank you for the Akasupa!

3911
02:35:46,030 --> 02:35:47,070
Thank you, thank you!

3912
02:35:47,070 --> 02:35:48,190
Hi Doki.

3913
02:35:48,350 --> 02:35:49,330
It's my birthday.

3914
02:35:49,630 --> 02:35:52,170
But I wanted to wish you a happy birthday as well!

3915
02:35:52,630 --> 02:35:53,950
And it says happy birthday.

3916
02:35:54,170 --> 02:35:56,550
Can you insult me for being a discord mod?

3917
02:35:56,850 --> 02:35:59,870
I don't have to insult you for being a discord mod.

3918
02:36:00,510 --> 02:36:01,410
Because you're...

3919
02:36:07,910 --> 02:36:11,490
You... You already did the job for me.

3920
02:36:15,570 --> 02:36:17,550
Thank you for the Akasupa.

3921
02:36:17,850 --> 02:36:18,970
Thank you, thank you.

3922
02:36:22,030 --> 02:36:24,210
Thank you, thank you.

3923
02:36:25,670 --> 02:36:28,770
Speaking of Game Grumps, today is JonTron's birthday.

3924
02:36:29,010 --> 02:36:29,850
He's 34 now.

3925
02:36:29,930 --> 02:36:31,030
Thank you, thank you.

3926
02:36:31,030 --> 02:36:31,870
It's actually crazy.

3927
02:36:32,030 --> 02:36:38,230
A lot of the content creators I watched growing up, they're all like in their mid-30s to 40s.

3928
02:36:38,230 --> 02:36:45,590
I think like the craziest part is that you see them all the...

3929
02:36:45,590 --> 02:36:58,190
Okay, I think this... okay, I'm not gonna name any creators but I think the funniest ones are the ones that are in their 30s to 40s and like... oh my gosh.

3930
02:36:58,290 --> 02:36:59,610
No, I shouldn't say it.

3931
02:37:03,300 --> 02:37:03,960
Nevermind.

3932
02:37:04,140 --> 02:37:04,760
It's mean.

3933
02:37:05,520 --> 02:37:06,860
I shouldn't say it.

3934
02:37:06,880 --> 02:37:07,980
It's mean.

3935
02:37:08,360 --> 02:37:09,580
I shouldn't say it.

3936
02:37:09,580 --> 02:37:10,540
I didn't say it.

3937
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:11,980
No, I'm talking about... okay.

3938
02:37:12,260 --> 02:37:13,540
I was gonna say it.

3939
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:15,140
The ones that are doing...

3940
02:37:15,140 --> 02:37:16,640
Oh my god.

3941
02:37:16,780 --> 02:37:19,160
The ones that are doing Roblox stuff.

3942
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:24,420
And they're like... cause like, you know, they started out Roblox content and they're maybe in their 30s.

3943
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:26,620
Or maybe in their 20s.

3944
02:37:26,620 --> 02:37:30,560
And they're still doing Roblox content and they're like in their 40s.

3945
02:37:30,620 --> 02:37:31,480
I don't know.

3946
02:37:31,840 --> 02:37:33,080
I don't...

3947
02:37:34,560 --> 02:37:35,080
Look!

3948
02:37:35,340 --> 02:37:36,280
Money is money!

3949
02:37:36,420 --> 02:37:36,920
I understand!

3950
02:37:38,020 --> 02:37:38,700
I understand!

3951
02:37:38,840 --> 02:37:40,100
Money is money!

3952
02:37:40,420 --> 02:37:41,880
Okay, I'm not gonna touch Minecraft.

3953
02:37:42,280 --> 02:37:43,560
Like, the Minecraft part.

3954
02:37:43,620 --> 02:37:45,780
This is why I don't... I'm not into like...

3955
02:37:45,780 --> 02:37:49,440
Like, I'm into... I like just casually playing Minecraft.

3956
02:37:49,720 --> 02:37:56,260
But the Minecraft community is like a whole nother section of do not touch.

3957
02:37:56,500 --> 02:37:57,180
Like...

3958
02:38:00,320 --> 02:38:05,400
Like, the Minecraft community section is just... I'm not...

3959
02:38:05,400 --> 02:38:06,560
It's like, they're saying...

3960
02:38:06,560 --> 02:38:08,540
Places you don't touch.

3961
02:38:08,780 --> 02:38:10,780
And like, you don't try to get into.

3962
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,800
Like, the Minecraft community is one of them.

3963
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:19,600
Like, I... I try to avoid what the fuck is going on in that area of community.

3964
02:38:21,100 --> 02:38:24,500
It's more so of like, the younger the audience.

3965
02:38:24,660 --> 02:38:26,000
Because it's like...

3966
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:27,560
Okay, this is how... This is my...

3967
02:38:27,560 --> 02:38:29,480
Um, this is my opinion.

3968
02:38:30,340 --> 02:38:31,820
But I think like...

3969
02:38:31,820 --> 02:38:34,820
The younger your audience base is...

3970
02:38:34,820 --> 02:38:36,540
The harder it is...

3971
02:38:36,560 --> 02:38:39,860
To control the community.

3972
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:41,660
And like...

3973
02:38:41,660 --> 02:38:43,780
And the harder it is...

3974
02:38:43,780 --> 02:38:44,610
To like...

3975
02:38:45,180 --> 02:38:45,580
Um...

3976
02:38:45,580 --> 02:38:47,000
How do I say?

3977
02:38:47,440 --> 02:38:48,800
Things will get...

3978
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:49,920
Like...

3979
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:51,000
Shit...

3980
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:51,840
Lots of drama.

3981
02:38:52,080 --> 02:38:52,680
I think.

3982
02:38:52,760 --> 02:38:54,460
The younger the community...

3983
02:38:54,460 --> 02:38:55,580
The more...

3984
02:38:55,580 --> 02:38:56,400
Like...

3985
02:38:56,400 --> 02:39:00,460
The more controversies and drama comes to be.

3986
02:39:00,700 --> 02:39:02,400
So that is why...

3987
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:06,540
If you are under 13 and you're watching my stream...

3988
02:39:06,540 --> 02:39:08,900
You are not supposed to have...

3989
02:39:08,900 --> 02:39:09,860
A YouTube account.

3990
02:39:11,060 --> 02:39:13,220
Unless you have a YouTube kids account.

3991
02:39:13,580 --> 02:39:14,740
But even then...

3992
02:39:14,740 --> 02:39:16,420
If you have a YouTube kids account...

3993
02:39:16,420 --> 02:39:18,540
You should not be able to watch this stream.

3994
02:39:22,540 --> 02:39:24,080
And don't say...

3995
02:39:24,080 --> 02:39:24,780
I'm 13.

3996
02:39:25,060 --> 02:39:26,340
Because you can actually get banned.

3997
02:39:26,580 --> 02:39:27,460
I'll say that now.

3998
02:39:27,640 --> 02:39:27,940
Like...

3999
02:39:27,940 --> 02:39:28,760
You're gonna be like...

4000
02:39:29,320 --> 02:39:29,860
I'm 13.

4001
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:30,660
Or like...

4002
02:39:30,660 --> 02:39:31,120
I'm 12.

4003
02:39:31,220 --> 02:39:34,120
You can actually get banned by YouTube.

4004
02:39:34,600 --> 02:39:35,980
If you're...

4005
02:39:36,640 --> 02:39:38,100
If you say that.

4006
02:39:38,260 --> 02:39:40,100
So don't tell us your age.

4007
02:39:40,380 --> 02:39:41,540
Do not tell us...

4008
02:39:41,540 --> 02:39:42,700
Don't dox your age.

4009
02:39:43,020 --> 02:39:44,980
Do not dox your age.

4010
02:39:48,540 --> 02:39:49,580
But like...

4011
02:39:49,580 --> 02:39:50,920
I just feel like...

4012
02:39:50,920 --> 02:39:51,740
Personally...

4013
02:39:51,740 --> 02:39:52,520
This is my opinion.

4014
02:39:54,100 --> 02:39:55,380
But definitely...

4015
02:39:55,380 --> 02:39:56,000
Like...

4016
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:57,740
If the community of like...

4017
02:39:57,740 --> 02:39:58,220
A fandom...

4018
02:39:58,720 --> 02:39:59,660
Or like...

4019
02:39:59,660 --> 02:40:00,920
A particular...

4020
02:40:00,920 --> 02:40:02,420
Just a particular community...

4021
02:40:02,420 --> 02:40:04,180
A majority of their audience...

4022
02:40:04,680 --> 02:40:05,560
Of like...

4023
02:40:05,560 --> 02:40:06,360
Whatever like...

4024
02:40:06,360 --> 02:40:06,580
You know...

4025
02:40:07,320 --> 02:40:08,240
Majority of the audience...

4026
02:40:08,240 --> 02:40:08,860
Are like...

4027
02:40:08,860 --> 02:40:09,280
Kids.

4028
02:40:09,740 --> 02:40:10,340
Like...

4029
02:40:10,340 --> 02:40:11,800
That's a lot of issues.

4030
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:13,780
Like there's a lot of problems and issues.

4031
02:40:13,820 --> 02:40:15,220
Because you can't control children.

4032
02:40:16,200 --> 02:40:16,800
Children...

4033
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:17,120
We're...

4034
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:18,740
I was a stupid child.

4035
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,100
I was a fucking stupid child.

4036
02:40:21,360 --> 02:40:22,280
That like...

4037
02:40:22,280 --> 02:40:25,540
Thought I was the smartest person in the whole wild world.

4038
02:40:25,700 --> 02:40:26,220
I'd be like...

4039
02:40:26,220 --> 02:40:26,960
I'm smarter than...

4040
02:40:26,960 --> 02:40:27,200
Like...

4041
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:27,780
I'll be like...

4042
02:40:27,780 --> 02:40:29,200
You're like 25.

4043
02:40:29,420 --> 02:40:31,180
But I'm smarter than you.

4044
02:40:31,280 --> 02:40:32,720
Because my opinions...

4045
02:40:32,720 --> 02:40:33,740
Matter more.

4046
02:40:34,180 --> 02:40:35,060
And then...

4047
02:40:35,060 --> 02:40:35,540
But like...

4048
02:40:35,540 --> 02:40:37,320
Our brains are still fucking growing.

4049
02:40:37,820 --> 02:40:37,980
And...

4050
02:40:38,520 --> 02:40:38,820
Back...

4051
02:40:38,820 --> 02:40:40,520
Now I think my brain stopped growing.

4052
02:40:41,060 --> 02:40:41,360
Uh...

4053
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:46,320
And...

4054
02:40:48,180 --> 02:40:48,780
Um...

4055
02:40:48,780 --> 02:40:49,800
And like...

4056
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:50,480
I...

4057
02:40:50,480 --> 02:40:51,140
And like...

4058
02:40:51,140 --> 02:40:52,600
I don't wanna argue with a child.

4059
02:40:52,920 --> 02:40:53,480
Like...

4060
02:40:53,480 --> 02:40:54,040
I don't...

4061
02:40:54,040 --> 02:40:55,360
I don't...

4062
02:40:55,360 --> 02:40:59,580
I don't wanna argue with a child to see who's right or wrong.

4063
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:01,380
Like I don't have time for that.

4064
02:41:01,540 --> 02:41:03,400
I have to worry about like...

4065
02:41:03,400 --> 02:41:04,040
Fucking...

4066
02:41:04,040 --> 02:41:05,480
Bills and taxes.

4067
02:41:05,620 --> 02:41:07,920
I don't have time to argue about...

4068
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:08,920
With you about...

4069
02:41:08,920 --> 02:41:10,660
What your opinion is.

4070
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:11,680
I just...

4071
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:12,460
Bro...

4072
02:41:12,460 --> 02:41:13,680
I'm stressed...

4073
02:41:13,680 --> 02:41:14,780
About...

4074
02:41:14,780 --> 02:41:16,100
Real life issues.

4075
02:41:20,320 --> 02:41:21,080
And...

4076
02:41:21,080 --> 02:41:22,280
Um...

4077
02:41:22,280 --> 02:41:23,060
And...

4078
02:41:23,060 --> 02:41:24,180
That's why I was like...

4079
02:41:24,180 --> 02:41:24,340
I...

4080
02:41:24,340 --> 02:41:25,200
I like...

4081
02:41:25,200 --> 02:41:26,540
I try to stay away...

4082
02:41:26,540 --> 02:41:27,680
In terms of like...

4083
02:41:27,680 --> 02:41:29,360
Communities that are more...

4084
02:41:29,360 --> 02:41:30,000
Like...

4085
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:31,400
Children centric.

4086
02:41:31,500 --> 02:41:32,620
Because like...

4087
02:41:32,620 --> 02:41:33,760
I feel like...

4088
02:41:33,760 --> 02:41:34,020
I just...

4089
02:41:34,040 --> 02:41:34,420
I just feel like...

4090
02:41:34,420 --> 02:41:35,420
From experience...

4091
02:41:35,420 --> 02:41:36,680
Not just like...

4092
02:41:36,680 --> 02:41:37,640
Not just...

4093
02:41:37,640 --> 02:41:38,300
From...

4094
02:41:38,920 --> 02:41:39,440
Current...

4095
02:41:39,440 --> 02:41:40,360
But even like...

4096
02:41:40,360 --> 02:41:41,540
In the past...

4097
02:41:41,540 --> 02:41:43,140
On the internet history...

4098
02:41:43,140 --> 02:41:45,080
The younger your audience is...

4099
02:41:45,080 --> 02:41:45,560
Or like...

4100
02:41:45,560 --> 02:41:46,500
The main audience...

4101
02:41:46,500 --> 02:41:46,780
Like I...

4102
02:41:46,780 --> 02:41:47,380
Like if you're...

4103
02:41:47,380 --> 02:41:49,200
If you're young and you're watching me...

4104
02:41:49,200 --> 02:41:49,580
I'm fine...

4105
02:41:49,580 --> 02:41:50,480
I'm cool with you.

4106
02:41:50,580 --> 02:41:51,200
Don't worry.

4107
02:41:51,440 --> 02:41:52,540
But I'm talking about like...

4108
02:41:52,540 --> 02:41:52,900
You know...

4109
02:41:52,900 --> 02:41:54,960
If the main audience base...

4110
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:56,500
Is just kids...

4111
02:41:56,500 --> 02:41:57,380
Is mature...

4112
02:41:57,380 --> 02:41:59,320
Like 80% children...

4113
02:41:59,320 --> 02:42:03,220
It's so hard to control that type of community.

4114
02:42:03,500 --> 02:42:04,020
I don't know.

4115
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:06,280
Because especially...

4116
02:42:06,280 --> 02:42:08,060
Especially if they are teenagers and...

4117
02:42:08,060 --> 02:42:10,400
We all know when you're a teenager...

4118
02:42:10,400 --> 02:42:11,340
You love to rebel.

4119
02:42:15,140 --> 02:42:17,120
You love to rebel.

4120
02:42:20,980 --> 02:42:22,740
It's playing with fire.

4121
02:42:24,180 --> 02:42:25,040
But yeah...

4122
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:25,940
That's why I try...

4123
02:42:25,940 --> 02:42:26,220
I...

4124
02:42:26,220 --> 02:42:27,400
I'm scared.

4125
02:42:28,140 --> 02:42:28,780
Lolly...

4126
02:42:28,780 --> 02:42:29,580
Thank you for the super chat.

4127
02:42:29,680 --> 02:42:29,920
Thank you.

4128
02:42:29,960 --> 02:42:30,540
Thank you.

4129
02:42:31,400 --> 02:42:32,040
Um...

4130
02:42:32,900 --> 02:42:34,000
The horse is sweating.

4131
02:42:35,720 --> 02:42:37,080
How dare you!

4132
02:42:37,580 --> 02:42:38,920
Apologize to Arlo!

4133
02:42:39,740 --> 02:42:41,620
I don't know what his real name is.

4134
02:42:41,780 --> 02:42:43,400
Apparently, he's a she.

4135
02:42:44,980 --> 02:42:48,040
How was I so... Okay, guys, I like how you guys are like...

4136
02:42:48,040 --> 02:42:50,060
Arlo is a she!

4137
02:42:51,780 --> 02:42:55,020
Guys, how would I know the gender of this horse?

4138
02:42:55,480 --> 02:42:57,460
They never mention it!

4139
02:43:00,260 --> 02:43:03,660
I don't have a game guide to look at.

4140
02:43:04,740 --> 02:43:05,380
Okay?

4141
02:43:05,380 --> 02:43:07,800
I know... This is what I actually miss.

4142
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:10,840
This is... You can tell bish...

4143
02:43:15,700 --> 02:43:20,780
You can see... What if they just remove it because they want the game to be PG?

4144
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:25,660
Not every game has genitals!

4145
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:27,440
Except for Genitals.

4146
02:43:27,460 --> 02:43:30,420
But not every game has genitals!

4147
02:43:30,800 --> 02:43:32,420
You don't know that!

4148
02:43:38,340 --> 02:43:38,980
Okay.

4149
02:43:38,980 --> 02:43:39,620
Anyway...

4150
02:43:39,620 --> 02:43:40,820
Okay.

4151
02:43:41,020 --> 02:43:42,400
What's the last Guardian?

4152
02:43:42,700 --> 02:43:45,780
The last Guardian... That game...

4153
02:43:45,780 --> 02:43:47,700
Was that bird thing...

4154
02:43:47,700 --> 02:43:49,200
A guy or a girl?

4155
02:43:50,240 --> 02:43:52,260
Was the bird thing a guy or a girl?

4156
02:43:52,460 --> 02:43:53,160
Tell me.

4157
02:43:54,060 --> 02:43:55,260
Guys, I need to know.

4158
02:43:55,880 --> 02:43:56,520
Hahaha!

4159
02:43:58,860 --> 02:43:59,380
Yes!

4160
02:43:59,640 --> 02:44:00,160
Hahaha!

4161
02:44:01,180 --> 02:44:01,700
Hahaha!

4162
02:44:03,060 --> 02:44:03,580
Yeah!

4163
02:44:03,820 --> 02:44:05,280
Where the fuck was the genitals?

4164
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:07,720
There was no giant pee-pee!

4165
02:44:07,880 --> 02:44:08,980
Bird pee-pee!

4166
02:44:09,300 --> 02:44:11,200
Oh wait, birds don't have pee-pees.

4167
02:44:11,220 --> 02:44:11,520
Sorry.

4168
02:44:11,700 --> 02:44:12,420
I forgot.

4169
02:44:12,580 --> 02:44:13,360
But it was like a...

4170
02:44:13,360 --> 02:44:14,080
A griffin.

4171
02:44:14,160 --> 02:44:14,880
So like...

4172
02:44:14,880 --> 02:44:15,780
It was half bird.

4173
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,580
Maybe the down half was not a bird.

4174
02:44:18,940 --> 02:44:19,460
Hahaha!

4175
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:20,840
Hahaha!

4176
02:44:22,780 --> 02:44:24,940
I forgot about that.

4177
02:44:24,940 --> 02:44:26,340
Birds don't have pee-pee.

4178
02:44:26,400 --> 02:44:27,620
All of it comes from one hole.

4179
02:44:28,580 --> 02:44:29,100
Umm...

4180
02:44:29,100 --> 02:44:32,340
The bottom half didn't have to be a bird!

4181
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:34,960
It could be a mammal.

4182
02:44:35,140 --> 02:44:36,460
The bottom half could be a mammal.

4183
02:44:36,700 --> 02:44:37,760
Yes, the lion half.

4184
02:44:37,960 --> 02:44:38,660
Yes, exactly.

4185
02:44:38,960 --> 02:44:40,300
The lion half!

4186
02:44:41,560 --> 02:44:43,740
Guys, where the fuck was that pee-pee?

4187
02:44:44,080 --> 02:44:44,600
No!

4188
02:44:44,940 --> 02:44:47,380
So games doesn't necessarily mean...

4189
02:44:47,380 --> 02:44:49,040
It doesn't mean that...

4190
02:44:49,040 --> 02:44:50,620
It'll show the genitals!

4191
02:44:50,880 --> 02:44:52,620
It doesn't mean that!

4192
02:44:53,560 --> 02:44:54,120
Anyway...

4193
02:44:54,120 --> 02:44:56,200
What I really miss too...

4194
02:44:56,200 --> 02:44:57,260
Is the game guides.

4195
02:44:57,400 --> 02:44:58,740
Oh my gosh, I miss...

4196
02:44:58,740 --> 02:45:01,340
I miss it when like...

4197
02:45:01,340 --> 02:45:04,440
When you buy a game, like a physical copy...

4198
02:45:04,440 --> 02:45:06,320
And then it includes like...

4199
02:45:06,320 --> 02:45:08,540
An actual game guide of like...

4200
02:45:08,540 --> 02:45:10,720
All the cool stuff about the lore and everything.

4201
02:45:10,940 --> 02:45:12,860
But they don't do that anymore because...

4202
02:45:12,860 --> 02:45:13,900
Like, you know...

4203
02:45:13,900 --> 02:45:15,120
You don't have to pay more money.

4204
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:19,100
And everyone buys digitally now.

4205
02:45:19,320 --> 02:45:20,520
Everyone does digital...

4206
02:45:20,520 --> 02:45:22,120
Buy digitally now.

4207
02:45:22,620 --> 02:45:23,300
Like, save money!

4208
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,440
We don't have to fucking hire a translator...

4209
02:45:26,440 --> 02:45:28,180
To translate the fucking instruction manual.

4210
02:45:28,560 --> 02:45:30,980
And also we don't have to hire somebody...

4211
02:45:30,980 --> 02:45:31,900
To write this up.

4212
02:45:32,040 --> 02:45:33,620
And also saves like the paper too.

4213
02:45:33,860 --> 02:45:34,840
The paper money.

4214
02:45:35,960 --> 02:45:37,500
Rock, thank you for the super chat.

4215
02:45:37,580 --> 02:45:37,820
Thank you.

4216
02:45:38,440 --> 02:45:40,080
Getting lost, wanting backseat.

4217
02:45:40,140 --> 02:45:42,860
What I'm hearing is Doki needs other wiles in life.

4218
02:45:43,020 --> 02:45:44,740
The game that attracts backseaters.

4219
02:45:44,740 --> 02:45:45,460
Thank you for the super chat.

4220
02:45:45,560 --> 02:45:45,840
Thank you.

4221
02:45:49,500 --> 02:45:50,060
Let's see.

4222
02:45:52,940 --> 02:45:54,120
The good old days.

4223
02:45:54,180 --> 02:45:57,360
When the game manual sometimes didn't even include the controls.

4224
02:45:57,560 --> 02:45:59,300
And was just a short story intro.

4225
02:45:59,520 --> 02:46:00,380
Thank you for the super chat.

4226
02:46:00,480 --> 02:46:00,760
Thank you.

4227
02:46:02,180 --> 02:46:02,780
Fudge top.

4228
02:46:02,900 --> 02:46:03,660
Thank you for the super chat.

4229
02:46:05,240 --> 02:46:09,540
Puzzle games with Doki is just chat plays with funny anime girl on the bottom right.

4230
02:46:09,620 --> 02:46:11,300
Talking about the weirdest things in the world.

4231
02:46:11,360 --> 02:46:12,480
Weird Doki's brain cells.

4232
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:13,860
Piloting the tomato.

4233
02:46:14,360 --> 02:46:15,500
Piloting the skin.

4234
02:46:15,740 --> 02:46:17,540
Thank you for the super chat.

4235
02:46:17,700 --> 02:46:18,160
Thank you.

4236
02:46:18,160 --> 02:46:19,000
Thank you.

4237
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:27,660
I am pretty sure the more I am as a streamer, the more stupid I have become.

4238
02:46:28,020 --> 02:46:29,520
I'm pretty sure.

4239
02:46:31,240 --> 02:46:32,440
There's no way.

4240
02:46:32,540 --> 02:46:36,480
I'm pretty sure I've actually lost brain cells from streaming.

4241
02:46:42,260 --> 02:46:44,960
I never read those game guides and just winged it.

4242
02:46:45,080 --> 02:46:45,740
But it was nice to have.

4243
02:46:45,740 --> 02:46:46,420
Thank you for the super chat.

4244
02:46:46,480 --> 02:46:49,300
I just like it when they include concept art too.

4245
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:51,120
That's what I loved about it.

4246
02:46:51,260 --> 02:46:55,300
I remember as a kid just looking at the concept part and everything.

4247
02:46:55,780 --> 02:46:56,500
I remember as a kid just looking at the concept part and everything.

4248
02:46:56,500 --> 02:46:58,200
And then the strategy guides too.

4249
02:46:58,420 --> 02:46:59,920
They don't make strategy guides anymore.

4250
02:47:00,060 --> 02:47:01,440
Because you can just fucking YouTube.

4251
02:47:01,660 --> 02:47:03,000
No commentary playthrough.

4252
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:08,260
Bro I used to own so many strategy guides.

4253
02:47:08,400 --> 02:47:09,640
I owned all the Pokemon.

4254
02:47:10,160 --> 02:47:13,220
Majority of the Pokemon strategy guides that came out.

4255
02:47:14,340 --> 02:47:15,660
Majority of the Pokemon strategy guides that came out.

4256
02:47:15,660 --> 02:47:16,200
I had to watch the next one too.

4257
02:47:16,400 --> 02:47:18,200
The ones that come with free posters.

4258
02:47:18,720 --> 02:47:19,940
We don't do that.

4259
02:47:20,800 --> 02:47:23,100
We just watch the no commentary.

4260
02:47:23,400 --> 02:47:24,380
They still make them.

4261
02:47:24,420 --> 02:47:25,340
Who buys them?

4262
02:47:26,060 --> 02:47:27,020
Who the fuck?

4263
02:47:28,980 --> 02:47:32,620
How do they make enough money to still make them?

4264
02:47:32,800 --> 02:47:34,160
I'm so confused.

4265
02:47:34,820 --> 02:47:35,300
How?

4266
02:47:39,320 --> 02:47:45,460
I'm surprised they still make enough money to manufacture the strategy guides.

4267
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:45,640
I'm surprised they still make enough money to manufacture the strategy guides.

4268
02:47:45,640 --> 02:47:46,580
Next one.

4269
02:47:46,640 --> 02:47:48,080
Thank you for the AkaSupa.

4270
02:47:48,340 --> 02:47:51,740
I can feel the stress leaving my body already.

4271
02:47:52,040 --> 02:47:52,840
Thank you for the AkaSupa.

4272
02:47:52,860 --> 02:47:54,120
Another happy customer.

4273
02:47:55,560 --> 02:47:56,940
Thank you for the AkaSupa.

4274
02:47:57,200 --> 02:47:57,400
Thank you.

4275
02:47:58,320 --> 02:48:00,480
Do people even buy the collector's editions?

4276
02:48:00,480 --> 02:48:04,760
I know that games nowadays they do collector's editions.

4277
02:48:05,220 --> 02:48:06,100
Stuff like that.

4278
02:48:07,760 --> 02:48:09,740
I'm wondering if people still...

4279
02:48:09,740 --> 02:48:10,140
Gosh.

4280
02:48:10,460 --> 02:48:14,560
I swear a lot of the collector's editions are so mediocre too.

4281
02:48:14,780 --> 02:48:19,420
I feel like there hasn't been really good collector's editions lately.

4282
02:48:20,280 --> 02:48:23,500
Because a lot of them are just incredibly mediocre.

4283
02:48:24,200 --> 02:48:24,980
I'm trying to remember.

4284
02:48:25,040 --> 02:48:27,000
There was a really bad one recently.

4285
02:48:27,640 --> 02:48:29,540
It was like... they kind of suck now.

4286
02:48:29,740 --> 02:48:39,760
I feel like they kind of just like capitalize on people just wanting to buy collector's editions because they are the fear of missing out and things like that.

4287
02:48:39,860 --> 02:48:41,360
Because they are like, oh I don't want to miss out.

4288
02:48:41,700 --> 02:48:42,800
It's limited edition.

4289
02:48:43,720 --> 02:48:45,320
There was a really shitty one.

4290
02:48:45,640 --> 02:48:47,100
Is it the Fallout 76 one?

4291
02:48:48,140 --> 02:48:49,480
The Fallout... oh yeah.

4292
02:48:49,620 --> 02:48:52,480
The Fallout 76 one was pretty fucking bad.

4293
02:48:52,780 --> 02:48:55,860
And sometimes the figures are so ugly too.

4294
02:48:56,120 --> 02:48:59,100
It's like the quality control is just not even worth it.

4295
02:48:59,260 --> 02:49:00,660
They make sure like the...

4296
02:49:02,460 --> 02:49:07,640
They make sure like the pictures for it is really really pretty.

4297
02:49:08,080 --> 02:49:20,680
And then because they grab the sample copy for the figure and then when you get it, it's just a very cheaper version of the manufactured, mass produced version of the figure and it's like not the best.

4298
02:49:21,940 --> 02:49:23,200
Thank you for the super chat.

4299
02:49:23,300 --> 02:49:23,560
Thank you.

4300
02:49:24,800 --> 02:49:29,440
Yeah, it's just to trap you in to buy the collector's edition.

4301
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:45,160
I also think... but like the thing that sucks that we are all going to digital now for like... I think the thing that sucks the most regarding like us transitioning to like digital copies of things is just the fact that when they take down the game itself,

4302
02:49:45,500 --> 02:49:52,840
like there's no way to play the game anymore like legally and I think that's the worst part because everything... there's no more physical copies.

4303
02:49:53,160 --> 02:49:59,380
So like I think they've been doing that for movies and TV shows now and like I'm...

4304
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:01,760
I'm... the thing that people... oh did you guys see?

4305
02:50:01,960 --> 02:50:06,640
A lot of people are really worried that when Gabe, you know, cause he's getting older.

4306
02:50:06,800 --> 02:50:09,620
I know like some of us know Gabe is gonna live forever.

4307
02:50:10,260 --> 02:50:11,500
He's a god.

4308
02:50:11,760 --> 02:50:13,280
He's gonna live forever.

4309
02:50:13,900 --> 02:50:32,500
But did you guys hear how like people are like worried that when Gabe like retires or like um or like is not here anymore that the Steam is gonna like start being like heavily regulated and stuff by whoever purchases... like whoever whoever owns Steam after Gabe leaves.

4310
02:50:32,820 --> 02:50:33,680
Because he's the CEO.

4311
02:50:34,680 --> 02:50:35,840
He's the CEO.

4312
02:50:36,180 --> 02:50:54,360
And like a lot of people are now like really worried at the moment because if you guys didn't know, Gabe the reason why Steam is like the way it is is because like every time like the shareholders or like stock people or like the board tells them to do something,

4313
02:50:54,580 --> 02:50:56,220
Gabe is like NO!

4314
02:50:56,480 --> 02:50:57,260
FUCK OFF!

4315
02:51:01,400 --> 02:51:04,860
He's like cause people will be like no you should do this Gabe.

4316
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:06,080
We will have more profit.

4317
02:51:06,360 --> 02:51:07,820
And Gabe is just like NO!

4318
02:51:08,220 --> 02:51:09,120
FUCK OFF!

4319
02:51:11,160 --> 02:51:12,920
Yeah it's a private company.

4320
02:51:12,920 --> 02:51:15,440
Yeah it's like a private company.

4321
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:22,940
So he's just like I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna worry about that cause people are like no if you do this this you do my... there's gonna be more money involved.

4322
02:51:23,240 --> 02:51:24,040
But Gabe doesn't care.

4323
02:51:24,260 --> 02:51:25,480
He just wants to do a game.

4324
02:51:25,620 --> 02:51:30,300
Like he wants to like uphold his philosophy when it comes to games.

4325
02:51:30,760 --> 02:51:32,400
And um...

4326
02:51:33,360 --> 02:51:36,360
And that's what people are like really worried about too.

4327
02:51:36,460 --> 02:51:46,720
Yeah there's no board but I'm saying like if they're like people are like encouraging him to to like people are encouraging him to do that but he always rejects it.

4328
02:51:46,820 --> 02:51:47,380
He always says no.

4329
02:51:47,820 --> 02:51:55,460
And and that's what people are really worried right now cause they're like obviously if Gabe steps down or like he's not the CEO anymore.

4330
02:51:56,020 --> 02:51:58,020
Like people are like oh no.

4331
02:51:58,280 --> 02:52:00,440
Like is it gonna go public?

4332
02:52:00,720 --> 02:52:04,020
Is Steam gonna become is Steam gonna become public?

4333
02:52:04,320 --> 02:52:05,200
Cause we don't know!

4334
02:52:05,360 --> 02:52:06,820
We don't know who's gonna succeed him.

4335
02:52:07,740 --> 02:52:08,260
Um...

4336
02:52:08,920 --> 02:52:10,200
It's just... it's scary.

4337
02:52:11,700 --> 02:52:18,760
Hehehehehehehehehehe It's so scary cause like what like oh man like what's gonna happen to the gaming market too.

4338
02:52:19,180 --> 02:52:20,820
Everyone's like really worried right now.

4339
02:52:20,820 --> 02:52:29,500
I saw like so many articles talking about it being like uh just like oh what is Gabe what's gonna happen to Steam after Gabe steps down.

4340
02:52:30,400 --> 02:52:30,900
Um...

4341
02:52:31,840 --> 02:52:33,260
Hey thank you for the super chat.

4342
02:52:33,320 --> 02:52:33,980
Thank you thank you.

4343
02:52:34,040 --> 02:52:36,760
I can't even see the ending because I missed a chance.

4344
02:52:36,880 --> 02:52:40,280
Imagine that for hundreds of full price games.

4345
02:52:40,540 --> 02:52:41,520
Thank you for the super chat.

4346
02:52:41,600 --> 02:52:42,580
Thank you thank you.

4347
02:52:42,920 --> 02:52:47,260
I know it's actually really scary for the future of gaming.

4348
02:52:47,480 --> 02:52:54,340
If Steam becomes like public I think it'll be like really uh it might it's gonna be really weird.

4349
02:52:57,220 --> 02:52:59,800
Hahahaha It's gonna be weird.

4350
02:52:59,960 --> 02:53:03,700
I was so sad when they took down the infinity train.

4351
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:11,900
I actually the infinity train has to be like one of my most favorite animated shows.

4352
02:53:12,920 --> 02:53:14,020
It's so well done.

4353
02:53:14,280 --> 02:53:25,880
And like there's no way to watch it legally because they actually wiped infinity train off the internet like for legal means of watching it.

4354
02:53:26,160 --> 02:53:30,600
And it's like um the lore for it was so interesting.

4355
02:53:30,840 --> 02:53:31,980
I really like the lore.

4356
02:53:32,720 --> 02:53:33,360
Um...

4357
02:53:34,660 --> 02:53:41,060
And there's like there's so many like animated shows too that that like they took down and everything.

4358
02:53:41,520 --> 02:53:50,560
Uh... it's not yeah it's a scary thing to go full digital because you just don't know when something's just gonna be gone.

4359
02:53:51,120 --> 02:53:55,740
Hahahaha Cause there was no physical copies of infinity train.

4360
02:53:55,960 --> 02:53:57,960
Yeah they removed it for tax purposes.

4361
02:53:58,300 --> 02:53:59,280
It's always like that.

4362
02:53:59,360 --> 02:53:59,840
I don't understand.

4363
02:54:00,500 --> 02:54:06,860
I'm not smart enough to understand like why they removed things for tax purposes.

4364
02:54:07,360 --> 02:54:16,480
Because I feel like the government shouldn't like I feel like the government shouldn't you know endorse stuff like that.

4365
02:54:16,680 --> 02:54:22,100
Hahahaha Hahahaha I don't know.

4366
02:54:23,020 --> 02:54:24,400
Um... I don't know.

4367
02:54:24,520 --> 02:54:34,640
I just feel like you know the government shouldn't be pushing for you know writing things off for tax purposes.

4368
02:54:35,300 --> 02:54:37,280
But I don't know maybe they get bribed.

4369
02:54:37,280 --> 02:54:37,760
Who cares?

4370
02:54:37,880 --> 02:54:42,400
I mean I care but like at that point it feels like yeah that's right.

4371
02:54:43,820 --> 02:54:45,180
Hahahaha Thanks.

4372
02:54:45,400 --> 02:54:46,320
Thank you for the super chat.

4373
02:54:46,380 --> 02:54:46,680
Thank you.

4374
02:54:46,700 --> 02:54:47,260
Thank you.

4375
02:54:47,260 --> 02:54:50,660
We go all digital and really bad solar storm hits.

4376
02:54:50,860 --> 02:54:52,640
We're all going to be screwed.

4377
02:54:52,800 --> 02:54:53,720
Thank you for the super chat.

4378
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:54,260
Thank you.

4379
02:54:54,280 --> 02:54:55,020
Thank you.

4380
02:54:56,220 --> 02:55:08,200
Hahahaha I'm still really sad about uh I'm still really sad about the Wall-E vs Acne movie not being out.

4381
02:55:08,320 --> 02:55:09,400
Did you hear about that?

4382
02:55:09,680 --> 02:55:12,820
Like okay I always talk about it but like the recent update.

4383
02:55:12,920 --> 02:55:21,300
Was that apparently the Wall-E vs Acne uh the movie um they said that oh what's his name?

4384
02:55:21,380 --> 02:55:22,400
I really like this actor.

4385
02:55:22,580 --> 02:55:24,080
The what was his name?

4386
02:55:24,080 --> 02:55:24,780
The main actor.

4387
02:55:24,900 --> 02:55:33,800
The main actor in that movie was like okay I understand it was like I watched a movie and it was Will was it it was Will Arnett.

4388
02:55:33,940 --> 02:55:34,340
Was it Will?

4389
02:55:34,360 --> 02:55:35,000
No not Will Arnett.

4390
02:55:35,100 --> 02:55:36,060
God it's one of the Wills.

4391
02:55:36,340 --> 02:55:37,380
Will Forte.

4392
02:55:37,600 --> 02:55:40,500
Why are every why is every comedian Will?

4393
02:55:40,500 --> 02:55:47,120
It's like every Hollywood actor is named Chris but this time every fucking comedian is named Will.

4394
02:55:48,240 --> 02:55:49,120
Will Ferrell.

4395
02:55:49,220 --> 02:55:50,080
Will Forte.

4396
02:55:50,120 --> 02:55:50,840
Will Arnett.

4397
02:55:51,160 --> 02:55:52,380
Anyway Will Forte.

4398
02:55:52,520 --> 02:55:55,400
He was the main actor for it.

4399
02:55:56,100 --> 02:55:56,740
Why?

4400
02:55:57,200 --> 02:56:00,560
Why is he in the movie?

4401
02:56:00,880 --> 02:56:10,920
And then um and then he was like I watched the movie and I thought they took it down because it was a fucking terrible movie.

4402
02:56:11,080 --> 02:56:14,300
And Will Forte has been in a lot of terrible movies.

4403
02:56:14,620 --> 02:56:18,500
So like I trust his opinion on what is a terrible movie.

4404
02:56:18,780 --> 02:56:32,160
And like no offense to him but he's been in a lot of them because as a comedian you're in a lot of terrible movies as a comedian and like at that point a paycheck is a paycheck and it's very hard to write a good comedy.

4405
02:56:32,320 --> 02:56:37,440
To write a good comedy movie you actually have to be like really smart.

4406
02:56:37,680 --> 02:56:47,140
Like I feel like a good comedian is um uh has to be like incredibly smart in order to write something actually funny.

4407
02:56:47,300 --> 02:56:58,120
Uh anyway sorry Wiley kind of anyway as I was saying and then he was tweeted out and he was like I don't understand why this movie is getting written off because this movie is actually really fucking good.

4408
02:56:58,520 --> 02:57:00,080
So I'm like why?

4409
02:57:00,980 --> 02:57:08,640
Fucking delete any of the other other fucking cartoon shows or movies for tax purposes.

4410
02:57:09,380 --> 02:57:12,760
The Looney Tunes is like one of your biggest properties.

4411
02:57:13,380 --> 02:57:16,120
Like everybody loves the Looney Tunes.

4412
02:57:16,400 --> 02:57:17,620
Why would you do this?

4413
02:57:18,220 --> 02:57:25,140
Who cares about Okay but who honestly cares about the new Velma season 2?

4414
02:57:26,860 --> 02:57:30,880
Everybody watched Velma to hate watch it.

4415
02:57:31,060 --> 02:57:32,600
Like honestly.

4416
02:57:36,380 --> 02:57:49,700
The only reason why Velma was doing so fucking well was because people were just hate watching it and they just wanted to like live tweet their hate for the show and they weren't actually watching it because they like it.

4417
02:57:51,900 --> 02:57:56,740
It was like a train wreck that people couldn't take their eyes off.

4418
02:57:56,900 --> 02:58:07,020
So people were like oh my god I hate this show so much but I'm not going to stop watching it because I want to know what they're gonna do next that's gonna make me hate it even more.

4419
02:58:11,980 --> 02:58:23,300
Um Anyway but yes I'm still so upset that I just want to watch Wildy Coyote vs Acme because it just seems like such a good fucking.

4420
02:58:23,560 --> 02:58:25,080
It just seems like such a good movie.

4421
02:58:25,200 --> 02:58:26,680
I really love Looney Tunes in general.

4422
02:58:26,820 --> 02:58:38,440
I honestly love that um which one except for Space Jam 2 that was just I can't believe Space Jam 2 didn't get cancelled for tax purposes.

4423
02:58:38,440 --> 02:58:38,440
I don't know.

4424
02:58:38,440 --> 02:58:38,440
I don't know.

4425
02:58:38,460 --> 02:58:38,660
I don't know what the purpose is.

4426
02:58:43,540 --> 02:59:01,520
Like that was definitely for my that was just nostalgia beating but I I know like it might be a hot take but I really I actually really enjoyed um fuck what was that movie called?

4427
02:59:01,680 --> 02:59:04,960
I watched it like several times because I actually really enjoyed it.

4428
02:59:05,020 --> 02:59:05,960
Back in Action.

4429
02:59:06,140 --> 02:59:09,160
I actually really liked Looney Tunes Back in Action.

4430
02:59:09,420 --> 02:59:10,960
I know when it came.

4431
02:59:10,960 --> 02:59:16,700
I know it had like really shitty reviews but it's I personally thought it was a good movie.

4432
02:59:16,920 --> 02:59:18,740
I thought it was fun.

4433
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:22,420
I thought it was yeah but when it came out.

4434
02:59:22,540 --> 02:59:28,720
When that movie came out it was a box off like was it a it was not good.

4435
02:59:28,980 --> 02:59:34,760
