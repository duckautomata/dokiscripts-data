00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540
Okay!

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,560
Okay!

00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,420
Okay!

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,220
Okay!

00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:03,460
Okay!

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey, everybody!

00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,220
Oh, hey!

8
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,180
Hey!

9
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,320
Oh, my God, guys!

10
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,700
Are you looking forward to watching me play Marvel Rivals today?

11
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:11,740
Woo!

12
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,980
We're not doing that, unfortunately.

13
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:17,800
Aww!

14
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:26,360
You were this close to... You were very, very close to playing Tetris 99 with the audience, so... Oh, my God!

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:26,720
Wait!

16
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,520
Can we do that?

17
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,540
Reschedule now!

18
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:31,900
Change everything!

19
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,400
I want to play Tetris 99!

20
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,360
Yeah, let's just do that.

21
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,520
That's what... Now, so here, for those of you who don't know how our show works, we're going to be people from the audience.

22
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,780
So, we need people who are just have lots of energy and are here to have fun and want to do all the wonderful fun things.

23
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,120
So, I need four contestants for this next segment.

24
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,060
Let's see some heads.

25
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,700
Who wants to be a contestant for this next segment?

26
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,960
Alright, wow, we have a lot of people who are willing to be contestants.

27
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:55,700
Whoa!

28
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,220
You guys don't even know what the game is!

29
00:00:59,380 --> 00:00:59,520
Yeah!

30
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,980
But does it matter what the game is?

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,360
So, you know what the game is.

32
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,420
Should I tell the audience what the game is, or should I just pick people without them just completely understanding?

33
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,980
No, let them, like, if it's a bad game, then they have to deal with it.

34
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:13,320
Yeah.

35
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:15,780
That's alright.

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,580
Well, you've heard our guest, so let's go ahead and pick four people from the audience.

37
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,860
Um, Griffith and Bryce, do you have any preferences on what you want to help pick, or do you want me to pick?

38
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,640
I can't see that.

39
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,200
Okay, there's a guy that's standing up, like...

40
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,640
Alright, alright, we'll go with the blue light stick.

41
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,480
Oh, the blue light, yeah.

42
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,160
Yeah, go ahead and go over to the stage, uh, to stage left.

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,840
Oh, this, okay, yeah.

44
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,360
Yeah, I was gonna say, this guy stood up.

45
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,260
This guy stood up.

46
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,880
Alright, I'm gonna, wow, you gotta, you have a lot of people with sticks at this show.

47
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,400
This is great.

48
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:44,960
Woo!

49
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,180
Alright, I'm gonna go ahead and we're gonna pick, we're gonna go over here with the, with the two light sticks over here.

50
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:51,640
Come on up.

51
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,100
Yeah, come on up, go to the stage left.

52
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,240
And...

53
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,180
So what I want you to do, well, so let me explain to you what you're gonna do.

54
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,700
I want you to know where I'm.

55
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,340
Two pairs of two people, please.

56
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,880
Two pairs of two people.

57
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,380
Okay, great.

58
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,760
Well, you're with a VTuber professional and performer.

59
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,380
You're gonna dance.

60
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,160
That's right!

61
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,560
That's right!

62
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,780
You're gonna dance.

63
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,860
We've chosen a selection of copyright-free tracks that you can absolutely dance to.

64
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,880
Our handlers will take you to the side.

65
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,220
You need to make a 60-second dance.

66
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,880
And you have about five minutes to prepare.

67
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,040
So, good luck, guys!

68
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,460
Okay, bye!

69
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,920
Yeah, yeah, you'll be in the next scene.

70
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,300
You're gonna go off stage.

71
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,000
You're gonna dance.

72
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,860
And guess who's gonna judge?

73
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,240
This person up here.

74
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,620
Yeah, I'm gonna watch you dance.

75
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,640
Alright.

76
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,440
That's why I hear what the thing is before you raise your head.

77
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,600
You should always check sometimes what you're getting into, so...

78
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,280
But that's okay.

79
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,860
So, where is the next game?

80
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,640
We're gonna do...

81
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,520
Yeah, we're gonna do this right here.

82
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,660
Okay.

83
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,620
Can I also have...

84
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,260
So, while during that... I don't have any downtime.

85
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,300
I'm gonna go straight into our second game.

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,440
I need four more people, and...

87
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,560
I want something who... people who are artistic.

88
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:40,980
Artistic.

89
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,760
Artistic.

90
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,780
People look lower their heads, they're like, Oh, wait, that's not me.

91
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,800
Okay, hold on.

92
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,100
Can we...

93
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,220
Uh, hold on.

94
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,080
Oh, yeah, they're doing name tags.

95
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,740
Okay, that's great.

96
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,820
Alright, let's go get four artistic people.

97
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,220
You guys are gonna go ahead, downstage, so that you can be seen.

98
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,180
Alright, let's see.

99
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,660
We need four artistic people.

100
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:02,980
Uh...

106
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,640
Oh, okay.

107
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,540
Now, we have a rule.

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,740
If you volunteer your friends, you volunteer yourself.

109
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,320
So...

110
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,100
Alright, go ahead.

111
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,680

Go ahead and take a seat over here at those.

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,020
The good part of Nevada.

166
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:33,920

Monterrey, California.

174
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,300
That trick answer is all evil.

175

186
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,860
And where are you from?

187
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,900
You're also from Nevada.

188
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,040
Have you met?

189
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:20,460
Whoa.

190
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,920
Do you want to?

191
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,080
Just say hi.

192
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,980
There you go.

193
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,560
Now you've met.

194
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,100
There you go.

195
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,640
Those are the contestants.

196
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,180
So there's our four contestants.

197
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,820
We are going to need the markers and the...

198
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,520
We are going to do the drawing round.

199
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,660
That's why we need the artist... That's why we need people who are artistic here.

200
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,340
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to give each of you some prompts.

201
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,480
One prompt at a time.

202
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,300
And our guest is going to judge both.

203
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,240
She's going to give you points if she can tell what it is.

204
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,020
And she's going to judge who's better.

205
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,800
So draw real good.

206
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,060
Yeah.

207
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,620
Yep.

208
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,060
Yeah, we're going to give you proper paper.

209
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,340
We're going to give you proper markers that stay in your hands that will never come off.

210
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:04,960
So that's okay.

211
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,680
Okay.

212
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,240
So your prompt is...

213
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,460
Wait, I'm going to know what the prompt is?

214
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:11,920
No, no.

215
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,540
Your job is to guess the prompt.

216
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,960
If you figure it out...

217
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,280
If they draw something and you totally whiff, that's hilarious.

218
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,780
So that's kind of...

219
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,240
Don't worry.

220
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,140
I can cheat.

221
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,800
Okay.

222
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,960
Anyway, here's your prompt.

223
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,800
Your prompt number one.

224
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,320
Okay.

225
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,080
Is it a dog?

226
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,820
That's prompt number nine.

227
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,400
Okay, your prompt number one.

228
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,340
Okay.

229
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,120
And your prompt number two.

230
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,980
Dog, cat, house, tomato.

231
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:40,900
Two.

232
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,640
Your prompt number two.

233
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:41,820
Tomato.

234
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,640
Spaghetti.

235
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,860
You're going to have to learn real fast.

236
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,580
And prompt number two.

237
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,420
Okay.

238
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:48,900
Alright.

239
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,700
That face!

240
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,440
She made a face!

241
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,100
She made a face!

242
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,460
That's a bad prompt!

243
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,360
She made a face!

244
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:54,740
Alright.

245
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,920
I'll put it this way.

246
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,900
That's a bad prompt.

247
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,400
You have 60 seconds.

248
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,580
You can try to look for a reference image.

249
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,480
Your time starts now.

250
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't worry.

251
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,960
I'll screenshot the picture so everyone can see it.

252
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,240
Yeah.

253
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,340
Oh, that's fantastic.

254
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,420
That'd be great.

255
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,680
Look at the draw.

256
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:12,800
Yeah.

257
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,620
So how are you?

258
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,980
How is Canada for you?

259
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,180
I mean, it's pretty alright.

260
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,100
I'm inside.

261
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,760
Like, I'm not touching grass or anything.

262
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,080
Oh, but the outside is where all the fun is.

263
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,240
Like, all the bugs and all the wind and all the dust.

264
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,340
The more you go outside, the higher chance you'll die.

265
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,340
You know?

266
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,780
Anything can happen outside.

267
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,540
I'm in a controlled environment right now.

268
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,740
Well, that's absolutely very, very safe.

269
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,880
So, I appreciate you being on the inside, as they say.

270
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:50,860
Exactly.

271
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,100
Well, I'm going to give them another 20 seconds.

272
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,080
I look at their drawings.

273
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,960
And let me go through a preview of their drawings.

274
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,320
And...

275
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,420
Those are good!

276
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,140
Oh!

277
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,320
She slammed her!

278
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,000
Oh, yeah.

279
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,780
We have a dominant player here.

280
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,160
She's done done.

281
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,920
She's so confident.

282
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:06,860
So...

283
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,300
Whatever, you're going to have to figure out what is...

284
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,600
What is good.

285
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,080
So...

286
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,640
I'm curious on the person who didn't know what to do.

287
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:14,720
She was...

288
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,760
I saw, she was like, I don't know what that is.

289
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,360
We're going to find out together.

290
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,380
And in five, four, three, two, one...

291
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,660
Hands down.

292
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,520
Caps on.

293
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,460
Because we don't...

294
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:30,560
Yeah.

295
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,160
See, that's what happens when you slam the cap.

296
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,500
Yeah.

297
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,260
Alright.

298
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,500
Alright.

299
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,140
Let's see.

300
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,620
Can I have cadences one and three?

301
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:38,880
Alright.

302
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,700
Don't worry, guys.

303
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,200
Alright.

304
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:40,920
Oh, okay.

305
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,600
Wait.

306
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,440
Alright.

307
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,520
No, that's easy as hell.

308
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,140
Let me save this real quick so everyone else can see.

309
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,500
They must be like, what the fuck are we looking at right now?

310
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:49,920
Oh, we're freaking out.

311
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,020
Alright.

312
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,620
This is what we're looking at.

313
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,960
I mean...

314
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,060
It's clearly butter toast, right?

315
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,240
It is exactly correct.

316
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,380
Now, which of our contestants did the better job?

317
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,100
Oh, man.

318
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,120
Oh, that's difficult.

319
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,080
I mean...

320
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,780
You can say...

321
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,940
The one to the far right, there's two butter toasts.

322
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,180
And two is butter toasts.

323
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,000
That's good.

324
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,040
That's good.

325
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,320
It's boring to eat, you know?

326
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,820
Alright, well, bonus points to our contestants on our right.

327
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,240
And it's a hot butter toast, too, because you can see the lies.

328
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,120
I don't want cold butter toasts.

329
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,560
Ah, the best kind.

330
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:25,960
Alright.

331
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,320
And contestants number two and four, can you show me what...

332
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,800
Yeah, show our audience what you have here.

333
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,080
Now, this is...

334
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,700
What the fuck is that?

335
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,220
Like, I just want to shoot it.

336
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,700
You guys, not you.

337
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,720
But...

338
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,900
She said it.

339
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,500
Yeah, yeah.

340
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,160
Like, I don't even think it's like...

341
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,500
I don't think it has rights.

342
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,320
Like...

343
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,740
What is that?

344
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,340
I'm sorry, I didn't make it bigger.

345
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,260
I can't tell.

346
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,120
Is this League of Legends?

347
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,180
Alright.

348
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,620
Does anyone in the audience have a guess on this?

349
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:10,940
Yes.

350
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,420
Is it Sylveon?

351
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,620
It is Sylveon!

352
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,120
Oh my god!

353
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,220
Oh my god!

354
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,720
Oh my god!

355
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,640
Oh my god!

356
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,380
Thank you!

357
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,380
Like, okay, okay.

358
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,380
I'm...

359
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,260
I'm so like...

360
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,500
I'm so like...

361
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,480
Why does she have one ribbon?

362
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,200
And what does she have...

363
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,660
Oh...

364
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:37,960
Okay, guys.

365
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,600
Okay, okay.

366
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,240
Let me...

367
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,860
Alright, guys.

368
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,420
I'm Googling Sylveon.

369
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,200
Okay, please.

370
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,320
Please do.

371
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:43,920
Please do.

372
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:44,860
Alright.

373
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:45,960
I am...

374
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:46,760
I'm...

375
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,400
I'm sad.

376
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,020
Oh, yes, yes, yeah.

377
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,000
We have a comment over here.

378
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,260
Yes.

379
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,580
I don't know what Sylveon is.

380
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,240
Oh, yeah, yeah.

381
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,440
She was the one who said she had no idea what Sylveon was.

382
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,720
Does not know Pockabon.

383
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,340
I'm gonna...

384
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,500
You don't know what Syl...

385
00:11:59,500 --> 00:11:59,980
Oh, I'm so...

386
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,520
Oh my gosh.

387
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,140
Don't be nice to her, Texas.

388
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,140
Don't rage bait me.

389
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:04,900
Nice.

390
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,020
No, no, no, no, no.

391
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:07,940
She's rage baiting.

392
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,700
There's no way.

393
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:09,860
Oh.

394
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,320
Yeah.

395
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,500
Yeah.

396
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:12,980
Okay.

397
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,680
Okay, so who did the better job between these two?

398
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,560
They don't even have bows!

399
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,460
You have to pick a winner.

400
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,520
I don't even want to pick a winner.

401
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,220
The other girl that drew the other Butter Toast, you won.

402
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,520
Contestants, can you flip your sheets over?

403
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,040
You're gonna get another prompt.

404
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,100
Now, you're gonna get two prompts.

405
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,800
You're gonna have to somehow do your best to combine them.

406
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,080
That's all I can say, okay?

407
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,420
You're gonna get prompts...

408
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,200
All four of you are gonna do this.

409
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,580
You're gonna get to do prompts 9 and 10.

410
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,720
9 and 10, okay?

411
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,300
9 and 10?

412
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,620
Yeah.

413
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,360
9 and 10?

414
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,380
Oh, no, no, don't cheat, don't cheat.

415
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,540
You have a camera here, can't you?

416
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,360
9 and 10, okay?

417
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,800
And 9 and 10.

418
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:17,960
Yeah.

419
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,200
You can add whatever details or flourishes.

420
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,600
All you have to do is just get both...

421
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,620
If she gets both parts of this, you know, however you do it, that's fine.

422
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,540
We're gonna give them 75 seconds.

423
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,280
A minute and 15.

424
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Your time starts now.

425
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,200
Now, now.

426
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,380
Now, the Sumion thing.

427
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,000
Now.

428
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,920
While they're drawing.

429
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,420
Now, now.

430
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,920
It wasn't that bad.

431
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,920
I mean...

432
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,480
I...

433
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,740
We're not here to coddle people, okay?

434
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,180
We're not here to coddle people, okay?

435
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,680
Now, now.

436
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,360
Now, we didn't...

437
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:51,480
We...

438
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,240
I couldn't get the scene set up in time.

439
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,180
But you were...

440
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,780
There was a...

441
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,720
In the original design, you were gonna draw for the audience at some point.

442
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,480
They were gonna judge you.

443
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,600
Okay, I can draw Sylvie on.

444
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,080
I...

445
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,540
I can...

446
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,580
Do it!

447
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,900
Do it!

448
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,800
Do it!

449
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,900
Do it!

450
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:10,540
Do it!

451
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:10,860
Do it!

452
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:10,980
Do it!

453
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,900
Can you do it in the next 35 seconds?

454
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,920
I can...

455
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,760
Okay, I will draw Sylvie on right now.

456
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,160
Okay.

457
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:16,840
Woo!

458
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,640
All right.

459
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,000
All right.

460
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,460
All right.

461
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,560
Well, the challenge has been thrown, so...

462
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,340
Uh...

463
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,780
Well, for all of you out there, if you could draw Sylvie on, why not draw one on your phone?

464
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,060
Just have fun with that.

465
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,960
And then, like...

466
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,400
Like...

467
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,920
I'm just...

468
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,240
It looks...

469
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,820
Already looks like Sylvie on!

470
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,040
Like...

471
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:37,920
Oh...

472
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,940
We can't see what you're drawing yet.

473
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,140
Okay, no, I...

474
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,360
There...

475
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,700
I literally just drew this in, like, 10 seconds.

476
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:42,860
Seconds.

477
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,600
And then you can look at this and be like, yeah, that's Sylvie on.

478
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,100
All right.

479
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,740
Like, I have all the important details in there.

480
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,500
All right, here.

481
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,380
Okay, so...

482
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,100
This is your Sylvie on.

483
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,620
Okay, this is MY Sylvie on.

484
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,060
All right, the point has been noted.

485
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:09,880
I will...

486
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,840
All right, I think that's enough.

487
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,980
I'm gonna give you five more seconds.

488
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,540
Five...

489
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,520
Four...

490
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:16,880
Three...

491
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,580
Two...

492
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:19,800
One...

493
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,040
Cancel down, caps on.

494
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,200
This is gonna be the last one.

495
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,580
We need to show...

496
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,140
So remember, this is two prompts combined.

497
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,720
So you would have to give me both parts.

498
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,080
They might have added other flourishes.

499
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,820
They were encouraging you.

500
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,160
So let's show our camera operators your pictures, please.

501
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,760
All right, redeem yourself.

502
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,190
Okay, I was like...

503
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,460
Dude, at first, I...

504
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,680
Okay, for one of them, I was like, am I dead?

505
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,560
Like, it looked like...

506
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,480
It looked like cooking Mufasa and Simba.

507
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,820
This is some reason.

508
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,060
I think you could tell which one I thought was...

509
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,260
Mufasa and Simba.

510
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,720
And I was like...

511
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,060
Oh my god, am I like...

512
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,080
Crying at my...

513
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,400
At Mufasa's body?

514
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,380
Like...

515
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,940
All right, that's what I mean.

516
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,780
And you guys can tell which one I thought was Mufasa and Simba.

517
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,700
Like...

518
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,480
Like...

519
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,060
This one right here.

520
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,900
Oh, someone's gonna be out of the wall.

521
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,300
Wait, let me...

522
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
Okay, Mufasa and Simba.

523
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,140
It's like, all right, all that I'm saying...

524
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,520
Okay, I'm gonna show a picture to you, and then like...

525
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,200
And then you guys would think it's definitely the same thing.

526
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,100
Like...

527
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,520
Oh, I'm not.

528
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,700
Like, right here.

529
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,420
That's...

530
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,520
That...

531
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,100
Yeah, that's it.

532
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,440
That's actually...

533
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,920
I'm like, Dad, no!

534
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,300
All right, so...

535
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,700
Okay, all right, anyway, back to...

536
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,560
No, no, no, this is fine.

537
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,200
Judging this contest.

538
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:03,800
So...

539
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,060
What...

540
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,260
What two...

541
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,160
What two prompts were used to create these four wonderful masterpieces?

542
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:10,840
Like...

543
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,120
I don't understand the stinky part.

544
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:18,940
Like...

545
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,020
Am I...

546
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,460
Like, am I actually dead?

547
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,520
Right?

548
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,520
Um...

549
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,620
It has to do something with me and Dad.

550
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,640
So...

551
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,620
I don't know.

552
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,320
I'm...

553
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,820
Like, he's sleeping, I assume.

554
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,680
He's sleeping, and he wants...

555
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,960
To my attention.

556
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,920
I'm just gonna say, the second contestant, the Mufasa contestant, is actually the closest to what I have on the card.

557
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,660
Oh, so was it actually Mufasa?

558
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,480
No, no, no, no, it was...

559
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:47,820
Um...

560
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,760
I'll give you all points, because I think you recognize that it's all...

561
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,420
It is all Dad.

562
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,480
Yeah!

563
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,900
And the second one is...

564
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,100
The second prompt was Body Pillow.

565
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,360
Oh!

566
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,780
Body Pillow!

567
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,560
So that is you...

568
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,940
I still think this is a better prompt.

569
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,560
So, I'm gonna say, is that...

570
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:05,860
That is...

571
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,540
That is Doki curled up on a Dad Body Pillow.

572
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,240
Is that what that is?

573
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:09,760
Oh!

574
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,940
That is a nice...

575
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,700
That is actually genuinely very sweet.

576
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,280
I like that.

577
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:15,980
Mufasa's still dead.

578
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,600
Alright.

579
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,240
So, since they all...

580
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,940
You identified that.

581
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,260
Who...

582
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,860
Which of our four contestants did the best?

583
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,400
Which of them?

584
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:25,900
Yes.

585
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,940
Well, I didn't get the...

586
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,500
I didn't get the Body Pillow correct.

587
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,580
No, you didn't get that.

588
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,400
So, but you still...

589
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,140
You can still judge...

590
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,540
You can still judge on artistic merit, and uh...

591
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,740
Oh, that's the wrong picture.

592
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,680
Let me look at all of them.

593
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:37,940
Yeah.

594
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,880
Let me look at all of them real quick.

595
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:42,940
Alright.

596
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,900
Oops, sorry.

597
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,540
Alright.

598
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,020
Oh my gosh.

599
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,440
Oh, so why am I...

600
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,820
Why is he stinky?

601
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,740
Wait, I just...

602
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,040
Yeah, why...

603
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,280
Why...

604
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,940
Why...

605
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,280
Why...

606
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:56,360
Why stinky?

607
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,540
Oh!

608
00:18:59,740 --> 00:18:59,900
The...

609
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,580
The Body Pillow says, Ya, Oni-chan, and Baka.

610
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,500
Oh my gosh!

611
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,400
Oh my gosh!

612
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,240
Oh my gosh!

613
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,640
Oh my gosh!

614
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,500
Okay.

615
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,300
So, who do you think gets the points for this round?

616
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,840
Okay, I think, honestly, I will have to...

617
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,080
I'm sorry, but the Mufasa one caught my attention the most.

618
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,740
Well, give it up for...

619
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,280
What's your name again?

620
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,240
Jenny!

621
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,640
Jenny are winner!

622
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,300
Alright.

623
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,980
Uh, did we have the little trinkets, the little small balls that we have?

624
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,260
The little big...

625
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,760
There's a big box of Spy Family, uh, little trinkets.

626
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,060
Or give them some medals, too.

627
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,320
Whoa!

628
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,720
We have a lot of medals we can give them, too.

629
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,360
We have medals?

630
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:43,840
Oh my gosh!

631
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,980
Yeah, we're gonna give you all medals, so...

632
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:46,740
Mad one?

633
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,340
Huh?

634
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,920
Mad one, too?

635
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,020
Oh yeah, absolutely!

636
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,200
Nice!

637
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,820
We have...

638
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,620
We have ones that say winner, and then we have a bunch that say...

639
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,140
Yeah, that's me.

640
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,820
We have a bunch that says, you tried.

641
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:57,780
So...

642
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,620
Now, I have the winner one.

643
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,160
Okay.

644
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,700
Now, we are going to do one more game at the end.

645
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,140
You're a winner.

646
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,300
Can you come back in about 20 minutes for this?

647
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:04,820
Yeah, okay, good.

648
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,560
Stay... stick around, we'll call you back, Jenny.

649
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,840
So, uh, as soon as the medals come out, can you please give it up for our four contestants who had no idea what was going on!

650
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,540
Yay!

651
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,210
Yay!

652
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,950
All right, go ahead and collect your prizes from stage left.

653
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:21,910
Yay!

654
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,930
Or actually, if you don't, you guys can just dole them out.

655
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,090
Just dole them out the prizes, yeah.

656
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:26,750
All right.

657
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,710
Thank you for joining us.

658
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,450
Thank you for joining us.

659
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,550
Go ahead and make your way out.

660
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,930
Take your drawings with you.

661
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,170
You can get them framed.

662
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:33,870
Yeah!

663
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:34,610
They're good!

664
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,970
You should be proud of yourselves.

665
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,510
I love them!

666
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,130
I love them!

667
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,430
I love them!

668
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,470
I'm so joking!

669
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,210
Let's go!

670
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:42,970
Let's go!

671
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,150
Now, who here remembers from a few minutes ago that we had a dance act?

672
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,510
We had two dance acts lined up.

673
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:50,970
Me too!

674
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,690
All right, can we have our first dance act come over here to kind of this performing area where it's a little bit of open-ended in the light of sight?

675
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,110
Come on up.

676
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,670
Do you feel confident in yourself right now?

677
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:07,950
Yeah, you have no idea.

678
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,530
Now, you have... over here.

679
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,230
Yeah, stand over here.

680
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,010
All right.

681
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,090
What do we have?

682
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,510
We have names and your name is?

683
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,730
Cafe Clone.

684
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,350
Yep.

685
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,090
And you are?

686
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,450
Eric, what song did you pick?

687
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,130
Sugar.

688
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:23,930
Sugar!

689
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,150
Sugar from the YouTube Audio Library.

690
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,370
Wow!

691
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,990
Bring up the pool!

692
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,170
Look, we just told you to choreograph.

693
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,370
You have one minute.

694
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,270
I'm going to go ahead and play you in on my side.

695
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,130
Hopefully that will work.

696
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:39,450
Yay!

697
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,430
Cringe Keno!

698
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,030
Let's go!

699
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:41,550
Yeah.

700
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:43,830
It's going to be great.

701
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,750
This is a great idea and we have no regrets about doing this show.

702
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,050
All right, here we go.

703
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,790
This is Sugar.

704
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:48,870
This is Sugar.

705
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,890
Guys don't...

706
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,930
Oh, come on guys.

707
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,590
All right, here we go.

708
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,710
In three, two, one, go.

709
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:58,810
Oh, sorry.

710
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,010
Oh, oh, oh!

711
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,430
Yes, you're right back!

712
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,170
Turn around!

713
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,730
Oh my gosh!

714
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,250
Oh my gosh!

715
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:18,930
It's amazing!

716
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,410
There we go.

717
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:21,130
Oh my gosh!

718
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:21,190
Oh my gosh!

719
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:21,390
Oh my gosh!

720
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,570
Yeah!

721
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,370
Take it!

722
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,070
Woo-hoo!

723
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,430
That's my copyright to music.

724
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,790
That's great.

725
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,910
That is for your minimum wage job at the top of the job.

726
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,200
Let's go!

727
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,030
Three, two, one!

728
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,950
Let's bring on our second team.

729
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,150
They were so excited, they had no idea what was going on.

730
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,970
Have a seat in our chairs, on the stage here.

731
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,130
Now, you two, go over there and go over here on the performance to art.

732
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,070
And you two, sit here.

733
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,430
All right.

734
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,070
What song?

735
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,730
Oh, let's get her.

736
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,710
I'm all out of order.

737
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,290
That's my fault.

738
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,210
What's your name?

739
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,050
Mako.

740
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:38,690
Yes.

741
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,010
You are?

742
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,070
Abraxas.

743
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,370
I love these cosplays.

744
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,470
I love these cosplays.

745
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,710
Now, what song did you choose?

746
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,770
Window Shopping.

747
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,510
Window Shopping?

748
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,770
Yeah, we didn't want to get copyright claims, so...

749
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:52,830
Thanks.

750
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,970
You know, it's part of what we have to do here, unfortunately.

751
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,070
It's okay, your song is Window Shopping.

752
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,950
You guys... That's right, I'll copyright claim this.

753
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,430
All right, let's go!

754
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,510
Oh my god, they're acting!

755
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,530
Oh my god, they're really rock!

756
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,910
That's what it is!

757
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,130
They're using, oh my god!

758
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,050
You can actually do these props!

759
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,130
I'm right there.

760
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,350
Oh my god, that

761
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,460
was...

762
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,180
All right, let's have a wedding now!

763
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,580
Woo!

764
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,230
They fell in love and got married!

765
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:15,030
I will say, when we wrote this, we did not expect to see a marriage!

766
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,350
Now, I will say that this is the third marriage...

767
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,290
Just like Las Vegas!

768
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,990
I think this is the third marriage we've had at the convention in the last ten years, so they're legally binding now.

769
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:25,950
Wow, congratulations!

770
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,750
It's legally binding, apparently!

771
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,010
Well, for those of you who don't...

772
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:39,210
There was one couple, ten years ago, they met in speed dating, and then they got married on stage at stage zero.

773
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,550
Oh my god, it's like pre-discord!

774
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,010
Yeah!

775
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,570
All right, so we have Cafe and... your name?

776
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:49,410
Eric.

777
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:54,310
And versus Abraxas and Mako, who here did the better job, in your opinion, in your professional opinion?

778
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:59,370
I would have to say, it's been done for a couple of shoes, because one gave me a story and a marriage.

779
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,210
But then, like, the first one, they were very enthusiastic.

780
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:07,250
When I said, turn around and smack that, the guy turned around and started shaking.

781
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,650
And I was like, you know what?

782
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,050
That guy clearly wanted to dance for the money.

783
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,030
So I had to go with number one.

784
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:19,630
All right.

785
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,730
Congratulations, Kelly!

786
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:22,870
Thank God!

787
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,500
All right, can we get some mini prizes for our runners-up, Abraxas and Mako?

788
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,140
And our two winners, two winners, and Ginny.

789
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,160
Again, we're going to call you back in about ten minutes.

790
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,820
Can I get another medal?

791
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,840
Oh yeah, we're going to have more medals, yeah!

792
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,560
Yay!

793
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,300
I love these medals.

794
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,160
I want more medals.

795
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,920
Yeah, I want more.

796
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,720
I want to buy a bunch of medals that say 5th place and just give them to everybody.

797
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,820
Okay, then it's not as special anymore.

798
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,240
Well, these are branded, so we can't use these after you.

799
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,180
So we have to give them away now.

800
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,620
All right, we're going to do another trivia-type game and I think...

801
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:03,720
Whoa!

802
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,780
Yeah, we're going to do a basic one.

803
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,060
We have about ten minutes before the final, I think.

804
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:09,880
Yeah, we can do that.

805
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,240
Yippee!

806
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,220
All right, and you're going to play too.

807
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,920
Well, I mean, I hope I get to play.

808
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,060
This is my panel.

809
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,540
Well, you've been judging.

810
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,140
You've been working very hard.

811
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,820
I want to play too.

812
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,520
All right, well then you get to play.

813
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,520
Thank you very much.

814
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,900
If you guys go ahead and take back your seats.

815
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,860
I love this window-shopping music.

816
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,140
It's like I'm in an elevator right now.

817
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,120
Oh, I have to mute this out of the Discord.

818
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,920
I'm sorry about that.

819
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,460
You've been listening to this in the last three minutes, so...

820
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,280
Yeah, I have to say it, but I think only was listening to this.

821
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,700
Yes, yes, you're out of the house.

822
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,420
Yeah, I was listening to window-shopping the last, like, I don't know, five minutes or so.

823
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,300
Oh, the next time we do this, we're going to have, we're going to use copyrighted music, but only the contestants can hear.

824
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,700
They just have to, they have headphones, so only they can hear.

825
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,700
I see.

826
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,040
I think that'll be fun.

827
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:00,860
Oh, we'll do that next time.

828
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,120
I can copyright claim because you're using my image.

829
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:03,960
Ooh.

830
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,440
Scary, she's starting to scare me.

831
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,060
She's right behind me, isn't it?

832
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,440
Alright, I need four more contestants for this segment.

833
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,580
Whoa, yeah, people are so excited.

834
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,460
Yeah, a lot of people go ahead.

835
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,300
You don't even know what it is.

836
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:18,660
Yeah.

837
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,800
Well, it is a little bit of trivia.

838
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,720
You need to know stuff.

839
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,020
You need to know video games.

840
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,720
Oh, video game knowledge time.

841
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,300
Yeah, that's fair.

842
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,840
My dragons better be gamers.

843
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,240
Alright, go ahead with the purple.

844
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,040
That's all we do.

845
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,920
The, uh, go ahead in the, oh, with the, oh, with the tie.

846
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:36,840
You, sir.

847
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,080
Yes, with the tie, yes.

848
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,320
You, sir, you look smart.

849
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,360
You have a tie on.

850
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,720
Ties are good.

851
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,560
Alright, but is this a clip-on or an actual tie?

852
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,760
It's an actual tie.

853
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,000
Oh, it's real.

854
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,120
He knows, okay, but did your mom tie your tie or did you tie your tie?

855
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,300
I knew it.

856
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,340
Can't fool me.

857
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:02,520
Alright, let's go to the, let's go to the back here with the, uh, Oh, with the, in the yellow over here.

858
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,620
And I need, go ahead and have a seat.

859
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,000
Wait, I need a kid with glasses.

860
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:06,780
Yeah, go ahead.

861
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,480
No, sit, sit down.

862
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,580
That's when I know they're smart.

863
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:08,700
Sit down on the chair.

864
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,340
Yeah, go ahead.

865
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,000
And, oh, we need, we need more fun contestants.

866
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,620
Who here has energy?

867
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,760
Yeah, a guy with glasses.

868
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,820
Or a girl with glasses.

869
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,580
Yeah, go ahead and you, and...

870
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:17,740
Yeah.

871
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,860
Oh, you want, you want glasses?

872
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,620
Yeah, I want glasses.

873
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,100
Alright.

874
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:30,240
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah, let's, let's, oh, I'm trying to, I'm trying to find, oh man, man, there are so many things.

875
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,620
Yeah, he's like, look at me, I'm holding glasses right now.

876
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,100
I, I, what?

877
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:34,860
You.

878
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,900
Yes, you.

879
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,060
Yes, you.

880
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,040
Does he have glasses on?

881
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

882
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,240
The one...

883
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,120
I love it.

884
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:44,460
Oh my god.

885
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,460
I love giving you this.

886
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,640
I got contacts on, too.

887
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,860
That's okay, uh, over here in this other chair.

888
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,840
Oh my god, he pretended to wear glasses!

889
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,580
That's dumb.

890
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,020
That's the word he's in real.

891
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,860
All right, hold on.

892
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,580
No, no, no, no.

893
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,720
We can fix this.

894
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,180
We can fix this.

895
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:01,900
Here's your name tag.

896
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,360
Where are your glasses right now?

897
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,760
Your name tag is L-I-A-R.

898
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,280
There you go.

899
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,700
That's right.

900
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,120
Never that shame.

901
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,380
V-R, yes.

902
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,220
That's right.

903
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,140
Oh, what happened to my show?

904
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,440
That's right.

905
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,120
Don't worry.

906
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,720
I'll immoralize you.

907
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,300
All right.

908
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,160
All right.

909
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,920
We're going to need someone... Oh, no, I can help you score.

910
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,540
Okay.

911
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,660
Let's introduce our contestants.

912
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,220
We have about eight minutes in this segment.

913
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,320
And I'm going to use this one.

914
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,840
Something happened.

915
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,600
What's going on?

916
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,760
Oh, God.

917
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,780
Oh, no.

918
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,020
Oh, no.

919
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,000
What is your name?

920
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,460
Hi, Chase.

921
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,040
Oh, you have glasses anymore.

922
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,380
Oh, you have glasses now.

923
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:00,700
Okay.

924
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,860
Not a liar.

925
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,680
Chase, and we have...

926
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,440
Danny, and we have...

927
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,020
Rocket Launcher, and we have...

928
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,960
Simon, thank you very much.

929
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,000
And we have on here, Doki.

930
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,700
Doki's going to play too.

931
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,620
Not a liar.

932
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,440
Not a liar.

933
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,140
All right.

934
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,400
We are going to do a simple game of...

935
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,420
Guess the game from the screenshot.

936
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,240
The earlier you get it, you get more points.

937
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,040
We're going to go in order.

938
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,640
And if you make a mistake...

939
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:28,860
Oh, sorry.

940
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,480
If you give me the wrong answer, it goes on to the next person.

941
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,660
So there's lots of...

942
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,540
Oh, so it's like Jeopardy rules.

943
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,260
Yeah.

944
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,520
Exactly like Jeopardy rules, except for the parts that are not.

945
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,140
So...

946
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,440
Okay.

947
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:42,860
All right.

948
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:42,880
All right.

949
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:43,860
So...

950
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,120
So the questions will get low-res and blurry, and they will get sharper.

951
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,860
All you have to do is just say what the next...

952
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,520
Ask for the next one.

953
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,340
So we're going to go in order.

954
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,780
Simon, you're on my...

955
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,940
You're on my left, or at least the audience left.

956
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,760
Oh my god, it's like GameDoll.

957
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,740
Yeah, that's actually closer to what it is.

958
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,360
So here we go.

959
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,820
Let's look at the first picture.

960
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,540
For 100 points.

961
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,080
100 points?

962
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,580
We're not going to start with one?

963
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,760
Nah, we're going to do 100.

964
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,940
Can you name what this is?

965
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,020
Simon?

966
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,640
5 Moribals.

967
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,580
Well, Jokey...

968
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,420
All right, let's go figure this out here.

969
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:27,200
Um, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

970
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,300
I can't afford to have a rival, guys.

971
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,140
That was instant.

972
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,780
I recognize that one area.

973
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,680
All right.

974
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,740
We're not going to get that.

975
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,280
That one map.

976
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,980
You said I could play!

977
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,200
It's not on the fist, I'm your turn!

978
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,800
It doesn't matter.

979
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,520
I'm Betty.

980
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,100
Okay.

981
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,040
Fine.

982
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,300
We're going to do it this way.

983
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,740
You're going to have to shut up.

984
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,300
Go ahead.

985
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,560
What do you think?

986
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,660
Everyone versus me.

987
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,000
What I'm saying...

988
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,300
Okay, okay.

989
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,460
You choose...

990
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,300
Okay, when it's their turn, you have to figure it out before I figure it out.

991
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,180
Yeah, it's going to be a race.

992
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:09,740
Okay?

993
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,940
Yeah, yeah, it's a race.

994
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:14,080
So when it's your turn, you have to make sure you figure it out before I do.

995
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,460
Yeah.

996
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,580
So if she gets it on the first one, more power to you.

997
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,140
You know, good luck.

998
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,000
All right.

999
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,180
So that was Marvel Rivals.

1000
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,380
Here is number two.

1001
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,020
That was like one second.

1002
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,040
That was pretty crazy.

1003
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:25,800
Here we go.

1004
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,300
Good luck.

1005
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,560
What the fuck is that?

1006
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,900
Let's just see how it's sad.

1007
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,540
Five, two, one.

1008
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,800
Oh, Simpsons hit and run.

1009
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,860
What do you think about this?

1010
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,080
Is that Simpsons game?

1011
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,300
Simpsons game is different.

1012
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,480
It is hit and run.

1013
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,040
It is correct.

1014
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,120
It lacks everything.

1015
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:52,940
He's fine.

1016
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:53,920
The plow king.

1017
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,840
And of course...

1018
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,380
It's way easier when you have the boss to work with to find images for the face.

1019
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,860
It's like, now we're going to test if you're an actual screen watching.

1020
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,020
That's pretty much...

1021
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,780
All right.

1022
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,900
Let's try number three again.

1023
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,740
Shout it, shout it.

1024
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,600
Don't worry about raising your hand.

1025
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,300
Just shout it out.

1026
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,040
Yeah.

1027
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,060
Because she's shouting.

1028
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,120
She's not raising her hand.

1029
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:15,680
Did you just raise it?

1030
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,300
Yeah, I'm not.

1031
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,240
I'm not polite.

1032
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:17,740
No.

1033
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,260
Here we go.

1034
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,220
I want to win.

1035
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,780
The next question is...

1036
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,900
I'm here to win, guys.

1037
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:24,980
Here we go.

1038
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,540
Stardew Valley.

1039
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,980
It is not Stardew Valley.

1040
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,580
Oh, I know what it is.

1041
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,460
So I feel bad.

1042
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,680
So I'm going to make sure you...

1043
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,340
Let's see how far you can get.

1044
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,020
All right.

1045
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,600
Two.

1046
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,760
I know what it is.

1047
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,100
Shout it out if you think you know.

1048
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,060
Yeah, it's Pokemon.

1049
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:45,900
It's Pokemon.

1050
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,240
Not Pokemon.

1051
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,480
We're on my stream right now.

1052
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,520
Mario Kart!

1053
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,320
I can't.

1054
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:51,520
Huh?

1055
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,820
Yeah, you got it in first.

1056
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,100
I think I'm going to go give it to all three of you.

1057
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:55,940
You got...

1058
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,520
I can't...

1059
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,920
You're wearing a thing on your head, so I can't tell if you're saying the answer.

1060
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,820
You're wearing a box on your head.

1061
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,460
This might be a problem.

1062
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,320
He's like, yeah, and I'm not taking it off.

1063
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,920
Let's figure out the rest of this.

1064
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:07,940
Yay!

1065
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,400
And there we go.

1066
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,080
It's Mario Kart!

1067
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,020
Oh, Nick.

1068
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:11,980
Where did you get a mustache?

1069
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,240
I'm Mario.

1070
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,120
I'm Tokyo.

1071
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,100
I'm Italian.

1072
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,640
Every Italian has a mustache.

1073
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,240
Okay.

1074
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,780
Let's do...

1075
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,340
Let's do two...

1076
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,960
Oh, this has a note on it.

1077
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,600
You come out of the womb with a mustache.

1078
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,780
Let's do a couple more.

1079
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,600
We need a winner here, so here we go.

1080
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,800
Yeah, I gave a pity win.

1081
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:37,760
Two.

1082
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,740
Huh?

1083
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,120
Three.

1084
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,100
Oh, but now I'm confused.

1085
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,260
Oh my god, that's a sponsor.

1086
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,940
It's one of my sponsors.

1087
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:52,880
Four.

1088
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,000
Four.

1089
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,120
Four.

1090
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,580
Four.

1091
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:57,980
Four.

1092
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,180
Four.

1093
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:58,580
Four.

1094
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:58,820
Four.

1095
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,140
Four.

1096
00:35:59,440 --> 00:35:59,540
Four.

1097
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,300
Let's go.

1098
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,600
Okay, yeah, you got to be more specific, because a lot of the gacha games, they sort of blur together.

1099
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:13,620
Yeah, but I think I have to give that one, as soon as she recognizes where it's from, that's...

1100
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,980
All right, this one, we're going to try to break a tie.

1101
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,500
We want to see, we want a clear winner here, so let's try the next picture.

1102
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,700
I mean, the clear winner is obviously me.

1103
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,920
Well, I know the clear winner.

1104
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:32,920
We thought for a chance, we thought for a chance that the cadences might win, but no, we realize this is wrong, so...

1105
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,640
All right, of course.

1106
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,860
I wanted more.

1107
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,800
All right, let's see.

1108
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,700
Can you get it off of this?

1109
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,940
Can I get it off of this?

1110
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,480
Apex?

1111
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,340
Apex?

1112
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,120
Correct!

1113
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,280
Actually, you got it.

1114
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,300
Actually, that's correct.

1115
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,220
Wait, is that Apex?

1116
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:49,820
Yeah!

1117
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,160
That's...

1118
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:52,960
Apex!

1119
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,620
Apex!

1120
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:54,400
Apex!

1121
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,220
Apex!

1122
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,040
Yeah!

1123
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,060
Uh, well, there you go, and...

1124
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,840
That's not fair!

1125
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,000
Who is that macro?

1126
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,860
Is that New District?

1127
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,140
I don't play New District.

1128
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,360
I don't know that!

1129
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,900
Well done for getting it on the piece of wood.

1130
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,920
That's actually amazing.

1131
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:15,420
If it was any other map that's not New District, I would have got it.

1132
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,720
Let's go to one more.

1133
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,900
And have fun on this one.

1134
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,140
Two.

1135
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,140
Overwatch!

1136
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:24,920
Overwatch!

1137
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,280
Two!

1138
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,860
That's Tracer's Gun, I recognize it.

1139
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,120
Overwatch 2?

1140
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,800
Overwatch 2?

1141
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,460
There's no way that's not Overwatch!

1142
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,260
I was gonna say, there's no way I recognize Tracer's Gun.

1143
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,400
I specifically was waiting for someone to say Overwatch 2.

1144
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,620
That's basically Overwatch.

1145
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,700
It's basically...

1146
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,020
That's Overwatch DLC.

1147
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,060
Alright.

1148
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,000
I have to wrap this up, so let's go really, really fast on this next one.

1149
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,640
One.

1150
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,700
Two.

1151
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,880
Oh, Fortnite!

1152
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,140
Yeah, it is Fortnite!

1153
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,740
That's Fortnite!

1154
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:04,680
Fortnite!

1155
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,820
There you go!

1156
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,480
And you can play with Darth Vader!

1157
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,500
Alright.

1158
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,820
Well, I think we have a winner, our liar here, Clyde.

1159
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,700
That's Chase.

1160
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,100
Chase.

1161
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:18,920
Oh, that guy!

1162
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,540
Congratulations, Chase!

1163
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,120
You've won!

1164
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,060
Thank you very much!

1165
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,140
You have some more to me, send your show.

1166
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,100
And give us a raise to serve your result.

1167
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,400
I hope you have fun.

1168
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,520
There we go.

1169
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,720
Just how it goes.

1170
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,240
You knew what you were getting to when you showed up here today, is what we're saying.

1171
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:36,800
Alright.

1172
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,580
Thank you very much.

1173
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,100
We're gonna give medals and...

1174
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,360
We're going to give medals and runner-up presents for all of you.

1175
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:49,100
And we're gonna call Chase and Jenny and our dancers up onto audience left in just a little moment.

1176
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,860
Give us a moment to reset and we'll be right with you.

1177
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,480
Woah!

1178
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,200
What the fuck?

1179
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,260
Sonic the Hedgehog?

1180
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,200
Sonic, what are you doing here?

1181
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,160
What are you doing here?

1182
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,740
You know you're in Big Mouth now?

1183
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,560
You're in the newest season of Big Mouth.

1184
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:10,780
Yes.

1185
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,780
Okay, let's get...

1186
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,200
Oh no.

1187
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:17,800
Thank you very much.

1188
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,800
You guys can go ahead and return your seats.

1189
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:20,920
Chase, you can stay.

1190
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,180
Jenny, you can go ahead and grab a slot.

1191
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,220
And where are our dancers?

1192
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:24,580
Stay.

1193
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,480
Stay, stay.

1194
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:26,820
Yeah, yeah.

1195
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,380
Cafe and...

1196
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,540
Yep, go ahead and take seats as we all switch in and out.

1197
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,740
Oh wait, is this the last game?

1198
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,960
This is gonna be the last game.

1199
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,980
We're gonna pick one of these people are gonna win, and then you're gonna play a bonus round with them.

1200
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,280
Oh, okay.

1201
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,240
You're in the bonus round.

1202
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,860
I'm the bonus round?

1203
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,200
Okay.

1204
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:41,520
Yeah.

1205
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,200
You're...

1206
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,520
You're on the contestant's...

1207
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,620
Well, you should have been on the...

1208
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,240
Wait, I wanna play the real round too.

1209
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:47,840
Yes.

1210
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,120
Oh, you are gonna play the real round.

1211
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,180
You'll see what's gonna happen like.

1212
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:51,740
It's gonna be...

1213
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,280
Alright, cool.

1214
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,580
Good luck.

1215
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,440
It's hard.

1216
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,500
But that's okay.

1217
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,520
Don't worry, I have Google.

1218
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,860
Alright, let's switch...

1219
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:03,680
Now...

1220
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,580
Now who's the nerd?

1221
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:04,820
No.

1222
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,740
Alright, let's go ahead and do this.

1223
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,760
So here's how we do it.

1224
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,900
We need one of you to come...

1225
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,740
One of you to be the winner.

1226
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,360
So we're gonna just do a very, very simple game.

1227
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:12,840
We're just gonna...

1228
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,040
I'm gonna give you a category.

1229
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,140
I have 17 correct answers in this category.

1230
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,300
You just need to give me one of them.

1231
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,400
And we'll keep going.

1232
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,100
Seventeen?

1233
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,860
Yeah.

1234
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,560
And you just have to keep going until...

1235
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,380
If you mess up, then you're out and the last person standing is the winner.

1236
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:26,600
Okay?

1237
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,360
Who should go first?

1238
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,280
Just out of curiosity.

1239
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,740
No, Gabe, did you have a preference?

1240
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,480
Just left to right.

1241
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,660
Just left to right.

1242
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,320
Okay, left to right.

1243
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:34,780
There we go.

1244
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,000
Yep, my screen's catching up.

1245
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,260
There we go.

1246
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,040
Discord is like that sometimes.

1247
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,520
Anyway, your final category is...

1248
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,680
Playable characters in Street Fighter 2.

1249
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:46,980
Ohhhh.

1250
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:47,440
Huh?

1251
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:48,840
Old school.

1252
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,920
Playable characters in Street Fighter 2.

1253
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:51,860
Wow.

1254
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,000
Doki.

1255
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,340
Alright, so we're gonna start with here with Chase.

1256
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,160
Give me one of them.

1257
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,640
Uh, Cammy.

1258
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,960
Cammy is correct.

1259
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,000
And Ginny, we have...

1260
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,860
Chun-Li.

1261
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,480
Go ahead.

1262
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:05,940
Uncle...

1263
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,480
Guile.

1264
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,000
Guile, correct.

1265
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,240
Ken.

1266
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:09,320
Ken.

1267
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,220
Honda.

1268
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:11,960
Honda.

1269
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,290
Ryu.

1270
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:16,940
Blanca.

1271
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,000
Blanca.

1272
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:18,680
Correct.

1273
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,500
And Bison.

1274
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,640
We're getting smart.

1275
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,840
We have Smart Contestants Day.

1276
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,280
Bro, we have Street Fighter players here.

1277
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:26,860
What the fuck?

1278
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,340
Jury.

1279
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,840
No, that was a three.

1280
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:30,460
It was four.

1281
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,620
Sorry, not four.

1282
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,220
Sorry, thank you very much.

1283
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:34,800
Goodbye, nerd!

1284
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,620
Thank you very much.

1285
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:39,900
Uh, Jenny?

1286
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,400
Wait, wait, wait.

1287
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,340
Don't do it yet.

1288
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,520
Oh no, we got more medals.

1289
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,480
Oh, thank you.

1290
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,600
Just more medals, there you go.

1291
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,040
You tried.

1292
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,900
You tried.

1293
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,040
You tried.

1294
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:50,780
You tried.

1295
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,220
I don't want to time you out, but I have to.

1296
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,540
Time?

1297
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,820
Oh, that's when you know it's serious.

1298
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,840
Zangief is correct.

1299
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,400
Oh!

1300
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,700
Akuma is correct.

1301
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,000
I can't believe you guys picked Zangief so late.

1302
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,580
That is not correct.

1303
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,600
Well played though.

1304
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,660
Alright, thank you.

1305
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:23,900
Goodbye.

1306
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,960
Alright, now we're down to two nervous contestants.

1307
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,620
A lot.

1308
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,620
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1309
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,680
Yes, there were 17 of them.

1310
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,120
I don't know where there's 17 in Street Fighter 2.

1311
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,000
She's got the advantage.

1312
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,820
Come on a friend.

1313
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,080
Three seconds.

1314
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:55,880
Oh.

1315
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,060
Two.

1316
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:58,920
Whoa.

1317
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,320
Oh, that's time.

1318
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,180
Can you give me one?

1319
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:04,900
You're going to go, who?

1320
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:05,660
Dan Hibiki.

1321
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,720
Oh no, it's not Dan Hibiki.

1322
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,460
Oh, we have a tie.

1323
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,100
Yeah, I'm going to get...

1324
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,260
So now it's just whoever gives me any correct answer.

1325
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,480
Any correct answer.

1326
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,340
She's locked in.

1327
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:18,700
Yeah.

1328
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,340
You can tell.

1329
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,080
They're both thinking.

1330
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,000
She's...

1331
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,100
Oh my God, I need to change on that.

1332
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,560
These are the characters that people...

1333
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,680
These are the characters that people hate.

1334
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,260
So don't worry.

1335
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:26,580
It's okay.

1336
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,480
What is it?

1337
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,280
This Richard guy, his name is?

1338
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,000
You said it.

1339
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:33,600
So you can say it loud.

1340
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,260
Judges?

1341
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,340
It's like...

1342
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:37,740
I'm kidding.

1343
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,580
You said...

1344
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,480
You said Dalsim.

1345
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,760
You want to give it to him on a schwa?

1346
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:41,280
No.

1347
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,020
I'll count it.

1348
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,500
All right.

1349
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,360
It's Dalsim.

1350
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,600
Dalsim.

1351
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:45,460
On a schwa.

1352
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:46,880
Well done.

1353
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:47,560
Thank you very much.

1354
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,780
And you get a medal.

1355
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,280
All right.

1356
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,580
All right.

1357
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,320
You were so locked in.

1358
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:54,860
You almost got out.

1359
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,480
You were locked in.

1360
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:56,340
Wow.

1361
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,260
Nervous contestants.

1362
00:43:59,640 --> 00:43:59,880
Okay.

1363
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,360
We are now going to go on to our final challenge.

1364
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,840
Where is our...

1365
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,360
Wait, where did you go?

1366
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:05,560
Yeah.

1367
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:06,960
Hang on here.

1368
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,600
Can I have a game, my game board operator?

1369
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,200
Would you like to...

1370
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:09,540
Oh, wait.

1371
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,540
It's bonus round.

1372
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,160
It's my turn.

1373
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:11,960
Yes, it is.

1374
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,060
Don't worry.

1375
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:13,440
Google.

1376
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:16,960
Yes, there you go.

1377
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:17,360
All right.

1378
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,200
Do you have your own sheeted questions?

1379
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,140
You should if you don't.

1380
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:22,400
It's...

1381
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:22,660
Here you go.

1382
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,440
There you go.

1383
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:23,820
All right.

1384
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,000
We're going to go ahead and stand over here.

1385
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,300
Do either of these mics on stage work?

1386
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,100
Let me get this out.

1387
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:33,760
Let's see...

1388
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:37,740
No, no.

1389
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:39,560
It's...

1390
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,290
One, two, one, two.

1391
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,110
I want to be able to hear our contestant.

1392
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:48,810
There we go.

1393
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:49,090
Here.

1394
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:50,370
Okay.

1395
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:50,470
Okay.

1396
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,130
All right.

1397
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:51,430
Cool.

1398
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:52,170
All right.

1399
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:55,910
And now, for this round, you don't have to do anything.

1400
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:57,010
What?

1401
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:57,410
Oh.

1402
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:58,250
Yeah.

1403
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,190
You need us to stand here and pay attention.

1404
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:01,610
Doki, hi.

1405
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:02,570
Just stand here and look for you.

1406
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:02,870
All right.

1407
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:03,190
Hello.

1408
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:04,790
I'm going to go over on this side of the stage.

1409
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,530
Actually, I'm going to go on this side of the stage.

1410
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:07,750
I'm going to try to get in the frame.

1411
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:08,090
Is that okay?

1412
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:08,490
All right.

1413
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:09,190
All right.

1414
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,470
So what do I have to do?

1415
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,730
Well, I have 21 questions.

1416
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,210
Wait, I have to answer all 21?

1417
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:19,950
If you clear 21 questions in three minutes, this gentleman here will win $100.

1418
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,130
If I don't get it?

1419
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:23,570
No, no.

1420
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:24,150
If you do get it...

1421
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:24,910
He doesn't win $100.

1422
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:26,510
If you don't get it, he does not win.

1423
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,430
Okay, I forfeit.

1424
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:37,390
Alright, it should be like I get the $100.

1425
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:38,950
Like why does this...

1426
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:39,830
You know what?

1427
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:43,130
Let me make a call.

1428
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:43,530
Hello?

1429
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:44,850
Yeah.

1430
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,490
Okay, fine.

1431
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:49,470
If you get it in 3 minutes, you will also get $100.

1432
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,070
Okay, I like that.

1433
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:51,370
Okay.

1434
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:57,370
Now, these questions are not meant to be that hard.

1435
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:58,210
Okay.

1436
00:45:58,210 --> 00:45:59,250
We've seen some other shows before.

1437
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:00,510
So they're questions like...

1438
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,790
They're all either or questions.

1439
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:02,970
Okay.

1440
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:05,390
Mario or Luigi, which one wears red?

1441
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:07,110
Oh, okay.

1442
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,670
Yeah, they're stupid easy.

1443
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:10,110
And I'm stupid.

1444
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,590
London or Paris, what's the capital, France.

1445
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,830
And your job is to get every question wrong.

1446
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:17,770
Wait, what?

1447
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:22,630
You need to get every question wrong.

1448
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:25,190
Okay, and then that would be red.

1449
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:25,630
Yes.

1450
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:27,430
Mario or Luigi, which one wears red?

1451
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:27,870
You say...

1452
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:29,450
Luigi.

1453
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:30,390
There you go.

1454
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:32,750
And London or Paris, what's the capital of France?

1455
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:33,790
You say...

1456
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:33,970
London.

1457
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:35,710
Now, she's playing, but you're...

1458
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,350
She's playing, but she's playing on behalf of you.

1459
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:38,450
Yes?

1460
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:39,290
Okay, so, yeah.

1461
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:40,030
So, shh.

1462
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:41,970
No help from the audience.

1463
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:43,750
She needs to be locked in.

1464
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:44,590
She needs to be locked in.

1465
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,830
I need to be locked in now.

1466
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:48,150
I need to be just like her.

1467
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,210
Okay, so are you ready to...

1468
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,590
Oh, so, if you give me the correct answer, we will go back to the beginning.

1469
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,510
If you take too long, we will also go back to the beginning.

1470
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:58,530
Okay.

1471
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:00,070
So, and when we...

1472
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:03,010
They will be the same questions, so I might go a little bit faster at the same time.

1473
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:03,930

But you can still check at me in my waiting room right now.

00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:20,650
I'll super check.

1591
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:21,170
50?

1592
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:22,370
It should be 90.

1593
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:23,990
At least I get 90, right?

1594
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:27,550
Judges.

1595
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:28,630

So, here's how this is going to work.

1604
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:37,890
We're going to take away the clock.

1605
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:39,170
We're going to go one pass.

1606

Both of you are allowed to collaborate.

1607

Alright, you can talk it out.

1608
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:42,050

That's why you're on the mic.

1610
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:44,890
Alright, you can do it.

1611

I'll let you do it.

1612
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:48,630
I'll let you do it.

1613
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:51,850
I'm going to cross over here.

1614
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:54,670
So, you can't see the questions, but go ahead and see.

1615
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:55,930
I'm going to shoot over this way.

1616
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:56,270
Is that okay?

1617
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:56,990
Alright, on the mic?

1618
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:57,210
Yeah.

Don't worry.

1620
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,130
If you need help, I have Google.

1621
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:00,830
There you go, yeah.

1622
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:01,710
Gotcha.

Oh yeah, well, she's going to try to Google for that.

1624
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:04,410
So, good luck.

1625
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:08,410
Let's try the same, again, same questions back to the beginning.

1626
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:08,950
Alright.

1627
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:10,630
If you make one mistake, the game is over.

1628
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:11,830
Don't make mistakes.

1629
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:12,770
Wait, okay, okay.

Yeah, it's $90, so don't mess up.

1635
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:23,410
And she has Google, so we'll see how this plays out.
