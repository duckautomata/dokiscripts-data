1
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,560
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,200
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,880
I'm back, guys, for the second stream of the day.

4
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,200
So, for those who don't know, I've never grew up playing Halo before.

5
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,220
So, this would be, like, my first time experiencing it.

6
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,460
And I've never played a campaign before.

7
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,060
I did play multiplayer with you guys a long time ago in a member stream.

8
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,180
But I've never grew up with Halo.

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,280
I don't really know much about the lore of Halo.

10
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,960
I just know that the main character's name is Master Chief.

11
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,240
And he's supposed to be mute.

12
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,440
He doesn't talk at all.

13
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,360
So, like, when they released a new, like, what was it?

14
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,280
The TV show.

15
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,160
The live-action Halo TV show.

16
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,500
And then, like, Mr. Halo started talking and taking out of his helmet and started talking.

17
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,900
Oh, he does talk?

18
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,560
Oh, he talks sometimes.

19
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,980
See, this is what I mean.

20
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,720
I don't know much about Halo.

21
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,100
I don't know much about John Halo.

22
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,320
So, he doesn't talk a lot.

23
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:54,660
Okay.

24
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,320
Apparently, in the live-action, he talks a lot.

25
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,100
And he also, like, takes off his helmet.

26
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,660
And then, all the Halo guys were like, how dare he?

27
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,720
The helmet stays on.

28
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,440
How fucking dare he take it off?

29
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,200
That's not my John Halo.

30
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,060
And also, yeah.

31
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,680
And then he started banging some chick.

32
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,500
That's all I know about the live-action.

33
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,560
Um, next thing.

34
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,620
Thank you for the super chat.

35
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:23,980
Thank you.

36
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,660
Thank you.

37
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,220
So excited to see you play Halo.

38
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,100
I hope you enjoy it.

39
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:28,740
Netbearers.

40
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,500
Thank you for the super chat.

41
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:29,800
Thank you.

42
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,300
Thank you.

43
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,140
Bite Size.

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,620
Thank you for the Aka Supa.

45
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,000
Thank you.

46
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,620
Thank you.

47
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,500
I'm so happy you finally had the chance to play Halo.

48
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,620
This series was a big part of my childhood.

49
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,120
So I hope you have a great time and enjoy the game!

50
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,180
Thank you for the Akasupa!

51
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:43,600
Thank you!

52
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,500
Jakarta!

53
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,120
Thank you for the Magenta Supa!

54
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,900
Thank you!

55
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,320
Finally, Doki and OG Halo!

56
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,080
Been waiting for this even before that infinite stream!

57
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,960
The Dragoons!

58
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,220
Notes before starting!

59
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,500
Titles in MCC have individual downloads and settings!

60
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,680
Classic and remastered!

61
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,220
Oh yeah!

62
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:00,860
Don't worry!

63
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,340
I make sure to download Combat Evolved slash Halo 1 before I start a stream.

64
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,560
So don't worry, I got that.

65
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,260
done already.

66
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,860
But thank you for the Magenta Supa!

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,100
Thank you!

68
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,580
Thank you!

69
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,200
But yes, I never owned an Xbox growing up.

70
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,620
Because like I said, my dad is a Sony boy.

71
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,860
So he hated any other console but the PlayStation.

72
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,380
So I never got a chance to experience Halo growing up.

73
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,480
I never played the campaigns before.

74
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,320
So I'm going in blind and everything.

75
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,500
I don't know really any of the lore.

76
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,060
of Halo.

77
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,160
I just know that we're killing aliens?

78
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,680
I just know that we're killing aliens?

79
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,460
And I'm the green guy.

80
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:59,180
The only time my dad ever got an Xbox was the Xbox 360.

81
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,080
And he only got it for Gears of War.

82
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,380
That was the only reason why he bought the Xbox!

83
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,860
And he still didn't play Halo!

84
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,320
No!

85
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:08,600
He didn't play Halo!

86
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,000
He did!

87
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:17,160
The one Halo game he's ever played was the RTS Halo game on the Xbox 360.

88
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,780
That was the only Halo he played and bought.

89
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,720
Like he didn't buy any other Halo game!

90
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,040
He bought Halo Wars!

91
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,300
And that's it!

92
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,720
That was my only introduction to Halo!

93
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,140
Was the Halo RTS game!

94
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,020
Johnny Lacone!

95
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,380
Thank you for the Akasufa!

96
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,680
Thank you!

97
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,360
Thank you!

98
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,760
I can't believe my OSHA will finally play a game I've loved dearly!

99
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,180
I really hope you enjoy it!

100
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,480
Seeing as Samara is my birthday!

101
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,440
The timing couldn't have been even better!

102
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,760
Incidentally, might I get a happy birthday from you?

103
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,520
Of course, Johnny!

104
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,640
Happy birthday to you!

105
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,540
Happy birthday to you!

106
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,580
Happy birthday dear Johnny!

107
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,120
Happy birthday to you!

108
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,440
Yeah!

109
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,620
Happy birthday Johnny!

110
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,600
And thank you again for the Akasufa!

111
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:05,920
Thank you!

112
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,580
Thank you!

113
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,600
That's crazy.

114
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,920
Halo has been around for so fucking long.

115
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,660
Uh, come to think of it.

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,280
When... Okay, Halo... Combat Evolve.

117
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,460
When was Combat Evolve?

118
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Because this was the 20th anniversary, right?

119
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,300
2001.

120
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,860
Oh my god.

121
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,960
It's been out for like 24 years now.

122
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,560
That's crazy.

123
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,780
It's crazy that Halo has like, uh, been around for that long.

124
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,740
Um, yeah, it's John Halo time.

125
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,120
Yeah.

126
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,920
Like, bro, he's about to graduate university.

127
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,260
My knees hurt.

128
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,520
Uh, Cecil, welcome to Samantha Farm.

129
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,080
Welcome, welcome.

130
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,920
But yeah, I'm super excited to experience Halo for the first time.

131
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,100
And, um, see what this is all about.

132
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:03,580
You know?

133
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,300
How it basically has such a very...

134
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,280
Um, um, very rapid... Is rapid the right word?

135
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,720
Uh, very supportive, I guess to say.

136
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,620
Very supportive.

137
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,760
Until they made Halo 4.

138
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,620
Uh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

139
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,520
Very...

140
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,840
Very supportive, iconic, dedicated, loyal fanbase that they have.

141
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,860
Um, so, uh, it's, uh, exciting to experience it for the first time.

142
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:36,140
You know, like, some VTubers, they have their Devil May Cry series, like, uh, uh, uh, playing Devil May Cry for the first time.

143
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,000
Other VTubers, maybe they're playing Metal Gear Solid for the first time.

144
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,280
I am gonna start my Halo arc.

145
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
I am gonna...

146
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,520
As the, uh, as the, as the, as the Gamer Bro V...

147
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,660
As the honorary Gamer Bro VTuber, I shall finally start my Gamer Bro arc by starting my Halo arc.

148
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,360
Uh, wait, no, I am in my...

149
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,980
I've always been my Gamer Bro arc.

150
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,180
Well, finally, finally, I will be a true Gamer Bro, guys.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,140
This is my initiation series into becoming a true Gamer Bro.

152
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,520
Ow, bro, playing Halo...

153
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,820
Combat EVVOLVED!

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,340
Alright, did I do my...

155
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,240
Oh, my God, I didn't even...

156
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,880
Oh, I did the Master Chief collection area.

157
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,760
Alphaean, thank you for the five, give the ships, thank you, thank you.

158
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,260
Onee, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

159
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,680
What I'm missing right now is my mountain dew.

160
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,700
If you ever enjoy, uh, if you enjoy your Halo arc, check out the cursed Halo mod sometimes.

161
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,680
Fun mod for Halo 1, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

162
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,540
You're right.

163
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,000
You're right.

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,520
It's like, that's like initiation number two.

165
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,380
You know, like when you get your driver's license, you have the learner's permit and then like experience permit.

166
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,860
I'm getting my learner's permit right now.

167
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,380
I need my Mountain Dew and Doritos if I really want to play Halo.

168
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,980
Alright, this is that.

169
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,360
Start playing missions from the beginning.

170
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:57,940
Quick start.

171
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Okay, we're doing normal.

172
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,280
Because I don't... Okay, is there a first attack?

173
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,200
Survival is not... Okay, do we do normal or heroic, guys?

174
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,580
I don't... Heroic?

175
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,440
Do you think I'm... Do you think I'm ready?

176
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,680
Guys, do you think I'm ready?

177
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,260
Guys, am I... Am I ready?

178
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:16,820
You don't!

179
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,710
Okay, I'll try my... I'll try my best.

180
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,770
I've never played Halo before, so I'm scared.

181
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,570
She's so ready.

182
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,650
Guys, you think I'm ready for this?

183
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:31,650
Guys, you think I'm ready for this?

184
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,030
Oh my god, it's my first time!

185
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:37,750
Alright.

186
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,090
I think this is the... Is this the original graphics?

187
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,390
I don't know if I put it on the original or the remastered.

188
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,100
I can't press tab yet.

189
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:53,820
I'm in the intro.

190
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,550
Oh, this is the remastered?

191
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,870
Okay, I need... I think I have to be, like, be after the cutscene.

192
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,330
I have to...

193
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,990
After the cutscene, I can change it, I'm pretty sure.

194
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,430
I can't change it now, because I'm in a cutscene.

195
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,890
Wait, can I swap?

196
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,270
When I'm...

197
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:18,910
In the game.

198
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,870
Okay, wait, I'll boost up the audio, too.

199
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:24,750
Uh...

200
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,210
I'm gonna tap back in.

201
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,630
Holy shit, it's so quiet!

202
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,950
No, I can't... I'm pressing tab.

203
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,450
It won't let me when I'm in cutscene.

204
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,670
It won't let me when I'm in cutscene.

205
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,010
Holy shit, it's so quiet.

206
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,670
I am pressing tab, guys.

207
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,870
I'm literally pressing tab.

208
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,190
On the far side of the planet.

209
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,200
Our fighters are mopping up the last of their recon picket now.

210
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:55,900
Nothing serious.

211
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,340
But I've isolated approach signatures for multiple CCS-class battle groups.

212
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:02,980
Make it three...

213
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,480
Oh my... I'm... Okay, I'll... I'll up it up, boy.

214
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,980
Holy shit, what is the sound balancing?

215
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,100
I swear to God, it's gonna be out of the cutscene, and it's gonna be so fucking loud.

216
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,500
I'm at, like...

217
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,000
It's based... Everything is quiet.

218
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,680
Let's give our old friends a walk.

219
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,400
Alright, guys.

220
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,540
I've already begun.

221
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,600
Okay.

222
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,800
Maybe, like, out of the cutscene, it'll be better.

223
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,880
There's Cortana.

224
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,220
Oh, I know what Cortana is.

225
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,580
Everybody wants to bang her.

226
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,220
I know her.

227
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,320
Yeah, I'll put Snipe Tiles on, too.

228
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,490
Alright, I'll... I'll boost the audio up even more, for everybody.

229
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,430
I'm just worried that it's gonna be so fucking loud when we get to the gameplay.

230
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,290
It's actually at, like, 0.8 now.

231
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,430
Negative 0.8.

232
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,830
And 0 is, like, the maximum.

233
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:18,530
Man, here's where we show those split-chain squid-head sons of bitches that they could not have picked a worse enemy than the human race.

234
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,350
We are going to blow the hell out of those dumb bugs until we don't have anything left to shoot them with.

235
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:27,050
And then we are going to strangle them with their own living guts.

236
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,650
Am I right, Marie?

237
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,650
Oh, you know this was made in the 2000s.

238
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,010
There's always the...

239
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,430
The one very enthusiastic sergeant.

240
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,990
We are re-engaging the enemy.

241
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,110
External and internal...

242
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,650
The motivational speaker.

243
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,730
Sir, yes, sir!

244
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,730
All you greenhorns who wanted to see Covenant up close.

245
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,150
This is gonna be your lucky day.

246
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,170
Hoorah!

247
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,110
Hoorah!

248
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,810
I love American military propaganda.

249
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,870
Sir, yes, sir!

250
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,770
That's me!

251
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,410
Is that the Master Chief?

252
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,550
That's Master Chief, right?

253
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Green man!

254
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,860
It's John Halo!

255
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,760
The John Halo!

256
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,200
Okay, let's fix this.

257
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:35,940
Alright.

258
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,060
Okay, let's fix this.

259
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,700
Oh, there we go.

260
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,460
Whoa!

261
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,420
What the fuck?

262
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,480
That is so different!

263
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,380
Oh my god!

264
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,320
What the fuck?

265
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,380
It's so colorful!

266
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,680
And then...

267
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,660
And then, like, I can count the polygons!

268
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,500
I...

269
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,560
Damn, hey!

270
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,380
Alright.

271
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,120
Oh my god!

272
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:10,620
Wait!

273
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,340
That's not the same guy!

274
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,760
I can't actually count the polygons!

275
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,560
Okay, let's do the audio.

276
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,200
Alright.

277
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,520
We'll boost it.

278
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,080
Why the...

279
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,220
We boost the game volume up here.

280
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,600
Uh...

281
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,240
I'll put it at 86.

282
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,670
And then...

283
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,840
Game music up by...

284
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,180
Uh...

285
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,860
Okay.

286
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,240
Let's see.

287
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,720
Why would I need voice chat?

288
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,260
Who the fuck's gonna be talking to me?

289
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,560
Yeah!

290
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,520
Ha ha ha ha!

291
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:46,700
Ha ha ha!

292
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:46,800
Ha ha ha!

293
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,180
Save settings.

294
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:47,720
Okay.

295
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:49,900
Okay.

296
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,740
Alright.

297
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:51,800
Alright.

298
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,400
Let me make sure.

299
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,420
Alright, so OG Graphics 1.

300
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,320
So we're gonna play on the OG Graphics.

301
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,380
Okay, I'm gonna turn this down.

302
00:14:59,680 --> 00:14:59,820
Alright.

303
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,240
Oh yeah, I forgot subtitles.

304
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,960
Where is the subtitles option?

305
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,380
Settings.

306
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:06,940
Uh...

307
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,300
Video.

308
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,320
Where is the subtitles?

309
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,520
What the fuck is it?

310
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,640
Do they have subtitles, guys?

311
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,920
Show, invite, multiplayer...

312
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,340
Is that sensibility?

313
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,180
Oh, there it is.

314
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:24,820
Alright.

315
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,560
Subtitle settings.

316
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:28,660
Extra.

317
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,420
Okay, let's do...

318
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,520
Original.

319
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,440
Alright.

320
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,160
Original.

321
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,240
That should be good.

322
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,560
And then...

323
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,420
Uh...

324
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:38,980
That should be good.

325
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,920
We should be good then.

326
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,000
Uh...

327
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,820
We'll put up the music a little bit higher too.

328
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,220
Okay.

329
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,100
Because I know, like, this game has a really good soundtrack too.

330
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:47,880
Alright.

331
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,710
No weapon.

332
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,150
Alright, hello.

333
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:54,830
This way.

334
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,770
Okay.

335
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,250
Whoa!

336
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,930
Oh my god!

337
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,010
Oh my god!

338
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,210
That was so loud!

339
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,170
I'm so sorry!

340
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,090
I...

341
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,340
He's so dead.

342
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,400
Oh my god!

343
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,960
Oh, he's dead!

344
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:20,780
He's dead!

345
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,100
Oh my god!

346
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,880
Thank you for the Yaku Super!

347
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:27,820
Thank you!

348
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,300
Thank you Halo for...

349
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:29,460
No!

350
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,580
I had mine really loud!

351
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,480
I...

352
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,700
Because like, my GoXLR separates...

353
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,220
Separates...

354
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,060
Between...

355
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,480
So like, because you guys couldn't hear, I also couldn't hear, so I've turned it up higher too.

356
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,200
Like higher than...

357
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,700
And then...

358
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,360
Oh, he's dead!

359
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,260
What does he look like when...

360
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,460
Oh, he's definitely dead.

361
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,200
Oh my god!

362
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,020
It's so bright!

363
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,740
As per tradition...

364
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,520
For Halo tradition...

365
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,640
I... I got the spirit.

366
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,120
Oh, why did I keep going forward?

367
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,320
Bruh.

368
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:08,760
Alright.

369
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,880
Isn't that this way?

370
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,460
Oh, it's here.

371
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,320
Okay, I couldn't see it.

372
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,000
Hello.

373
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,720
Oh my god, it's so trippy.

374
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,280
I like seeing, like...

375
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,680
I like seeing, like, the difference between, like, the graphics.

376
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,420
Oh, the... Oh my god!

377
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,220
I can actually see what they look like.

378
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,360
Wait.

379
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,320
Wait a minute.

380
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,460
Why you close that door?

381
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,760
Okay, I'm going this way.

382
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,080
Hello.

383
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,140
Oh, where's the bridge?

384
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,620
I'm trying to get there as fast as I can!

385
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,560
Do what?

386
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,100
Oh, here.

387
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,180
Here.

388
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,760
Okay, he let me go through this time.

389
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,740
Hello.

390
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,420
What do you look like when you're extra dead?

391
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,940
Oh my god.

392
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,400
Old, young.

393
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,700
Old, young.

394
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,760
Wait, I can see everything.

395
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,100
Okay, you're still young.

396
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,240
I mean, he is not dead.

397
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,140
He got a really good plastic surgeon.

398
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,060
Captain Keyes is waiting for us, sir.

399
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,120
Oh wait, I wanted to see you talk.

400
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,000
I want to know if you sound different, too.

401
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,400
Hello.

402
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,030
Captain Keyes is just swapping between timelines.

403
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:49,810
He's just swapping between timelines.

404
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,110
Well, Cortana did her best, but we never really had a chance.

405
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,390
A dozen Covenant Superior battleships against a single Halcyon class cruiser.

406
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:01,130
With those odds, I'm content with three, make them four kills.

407
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:02,850
Sleep well?

408
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,570
No thanks to your driving.

409
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,090
Yes.

410
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,710
So you did miss me.

411
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,410
Report!

412
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,770
It must have been one of their boarding parties.

413
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,410
Oh no!

414
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,430
I guess an anti-matter charge.

415
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:15,850
Ma 'am!

416
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,430
Cortana, what do we do?

417
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,630
Captain, the cannon was my last offensive option.

418
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,770
Ah, right then.

419
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,650
I'm initiating cold protocol article two.

420
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,050
We're abandoning the autumn.

421
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,170
It's the Microsoft girl.

422
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:27,710
Oh yeah!

423
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,330
While you do what?

424
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,250
Go down with the ship?

425
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,970
In a manner of speaking.

426
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,990
The object we found, I'm going to try and land the autumn on it.

427
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,150
With all due respect, sir, this war has enough dead heroes.

428
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,350
I appreciate your concern, Cortana, but it's not up to me.

429
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,910
Oh, why would you ever insult Cortana?

430
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,590
Look at her!

431
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,070
Look at the perfect angle, too.

432
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,390
Lock in a selection of emergency landing zones.

433
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,250
Upload them to my neural lace.

434
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,650
And then sort yourself for a heart transfer.

435
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,010
Aye, aye, sir.

436
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,070
Which is where you come in, chief.

437
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,550
Get Cortana off this ship.

438
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,790
Keep her safe from the enemy.

439
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,210
If they capture her, they'll learn everything.

440
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,190
Force deployment, weapons research.

441
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,550
Just delete her.

442
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,650
Control-Alt-Delete.

443
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,370
The autumn will continue evasive maneuvers until you initiate a landing sequence.

444
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:26,390
Not that you'll listen, but I'd suggest letting my subroutines handle the final approach.

445
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,370
No, I can't.

446
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,270
Not in this.

447
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,950
I can't swap.

448
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:29,570
Thank you.

449
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:29,810
Uh.

450
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,490
Are you ready?

451
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,770
I can't swap graphics and cutscenes.

452
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,490
No.

453
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,110
It won't let me.

454
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,150
It just says press space to skip.

455
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,010
Beamer.

456
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,030
Beamer up.

457
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,480
Good luck, master chief.

458
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,200
That's me.

459
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,920
I don't need luck.

460
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,800
Your architecture isn't much different from the autos.

461
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,340
I just need my mounted, dude.

462
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,100
Don't keep it loaded, son.

463
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,680
You'll have to find ammo as you go.

464
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,780
What the fuck?

465
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,820
We're in a military ship.

466
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,340
Why do you not have it loaded?

467
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,620
Gator, thank you for the super chat.

468
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,020
Thank you.

469
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:15,500
Thank you.

470
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,540
Did you know in a critically acclaimed and very accurate to the Halo Lord Halo TV show?

471
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,540
They made...

472
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,340
They showed John Halo's ass.

473
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,680
That happens in the game later on, too.

474
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,800
Sorry for the spoilers.

475
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,340
Thank you for the super chat.

476
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:28,700
Thank you.

477
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,400
Thank you.

478
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,560
I don't have melee.

479
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,200
Wait, do I?

480
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
No, I don't.

481
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,840
I was trying to see if I could have melee or not.

482
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,760
That's right.

483
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,920
I don't need cover.

484
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,020
I do?

485
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,320
Do I have melee?

486
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,160
Wait, I gotta figure out how to melee.

487
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,740
Give me a sec.

488
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,760
Control of this.

489
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,560
Where the fuck is melee?

490
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,980
Where am I?

491
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,540
Oh, computer bindings.

492
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:13,940
Okay.

493
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:14,700
Crouch.

494
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,520
Space.

495
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,280
Fire.

496
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,000
Zoom.

497
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,480
Q!

498
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,580
Okay, I'm putting that...

499
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,640
I'll put that here.

500
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,480
And then I'll put that on my other mouse.

501
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,520
And that should be good.

502
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,380
Okay.

503
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:27,680
Oh, wait.

504
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,480
I have a flashlight?

505
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,660
What's my flashlight?

506
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Oh, there it is.

507
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:33,660
Four!

508
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,000
That should be F.

509
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,380
Okay.

510
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,320
There we go.

511
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,540
There you go.

512
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,280
Now it's better.

513
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,240
Okay.

514
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,980
There we go.

515
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,880
I lost him.

516
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,700
I know you're there!

517
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,220
There you go.

518
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,480
Just run and gun.

519
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,620
That's right.

520
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,360
I'm strafing!

521
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,160
Deion can't handle this!

522
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,240
Oh, shit!

523
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,680
Wait, he can beat me up, too?

524
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,120
Okay, maybe I...

525
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,500
Oh!

526
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,620
Okay, I know how I'm playing now.

527
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,100
I know how I'm playing.

528
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,780
I'm not gonna fuck around.

529
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,420
Okay, maybe I'll use a little cover.

530
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,580
I was not paying attention to my healers, by the way.

531
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,180
I...

532
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:14,760
I...

533
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,220
I...

534
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,860
I didn't think it was a super chat.

535
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,340
Was it noticeable?

536
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
I wasn't paying attention to my health.

537
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,960
I can't believe it!

538
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,500
He can fucking fight back!

539
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,700
You're a bot!

540
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:32,700
What?

541
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,420
Jesus Christ.

542
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,460
I can't just leave, you signed up for the army!

543
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,440
Okay, I need... Wait, how do I... Oh my god!

544
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:51,920
What?!

545
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:57,010
Where was the grenade?!

546
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,410
Where the fuck?!

547
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,410
Oh my god, I'm blind!

548
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:02,810
I'm...

549
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,350
That sticks to me?!

550
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,090
Oh my god, I didn't know that sticks to me.

551
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,270
Oh, wait, what the fuck is this gun?

552
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,450
Okay, now I know.

553
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,330
Okay, guys, I'm learning.

554
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,590
Jesus Christ, I don't know if I like this gun.

555
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,930
Yeah, I'm not a fan of this one.

556
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:31,530
Stop!

557
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,430
That's illegal!

558
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,130
Okay, I'm not... I'm not a fan of this gun.

559
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,970
I need something else.

560
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:42,930
Oh no.

561
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,590
Don't suck me!

562
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,130
Don't stick me!

563
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:45,570
Don't stick me!

564
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,630
I'm trying to find another gun!

565
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,050
Don't stick me!

566
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,310
Guys, did any of our own people die?

567
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,850
So I can steal their gun?

568
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,330
Yeah, the common elites are pretty elite.

569
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,450
They can... They can dodge?!

570
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,310
Okay, where... Where'd I put... Okay, there you go.

571
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,410
There's my other gun.

572
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:09,430
Alright.

573
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,310
Alright.

574
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,990
Oh, I'm not used to using, uh... Number keys to swap weapons.

575
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:19,690
Stupid.

576
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,950
Okay, now I know it's a shitty gun.

577
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:22,950
Oh, man.

578
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,210
Whoa!

579
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:26,610
Whoa!

580
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,490
Jesus, why is this so bright in the remastered?

581
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:35,450
It's like being like it's too... It's too dark and depressing.

582
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,330
Gotta make it brighter.

583
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,330
Is pistol better?

584
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,550
Okay, I'll try the pistol.

585
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,930
It's so fucking bright.

586
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,390
Jesus, they're dodging!

587
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,450
He's dodging!

588
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,650
Weaving and weaving!

589
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,170
Get up!

590
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:57,690
Get up!

591
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,710
Get up so I can kill you again!

592
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,190
Okay, he's dead, guys.

593
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:00,710
He's dead.

594
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:01,050
Stop.

595
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:01,930
He's dead.

596
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:02,410
What the hell?

597
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,890
Did something just hit us?

598
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:04,990
Move in!

599
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:05,930
Back to the airlock!

600
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,310
Alright.

601
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,410
I'm going this way.

602
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,210
Hello, guys.

603
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:09,710
Oh!

604
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:10,830
Goodbye, guys!

605
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,470
Goodbye!

606
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,370
You guys got this, right?

607
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,370
You clearly have a lot of HP, I believe.

608
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,490
Oh my god, no.

609
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:21,930
Not my ammo.

610
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,630
If you guys die, I can steal your gun.

611
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,050
I would like that.

612
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,410
It's okay if you die.

613
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:27,990
That's right.

614
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:28,750
Go in there.

615
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,390
Go in there, guys.

616
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,370
I would like to take your ammo.

617
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,890
What's in here?

618
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,090
Oh, nothing.

619
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,030
Whoa!

620
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,130
What did I do?

621
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,570
They're using our lifeboat airlocks to attach their boarding craft.

622
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,590
I could kill the Marines?

623
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,270
Guys, if I kill the Marines, I can steal their ammo.

624
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,520
Whoa!

625
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:57,540
Whoa!

626
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,500
That's right.

627
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,500
Did he see you?

628
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,340
Come on the way!

629
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,300
That's fucking right.

630
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,140
I saw you.

631
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,080
Come on the head, Cheek.

632
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:07,520
We'll secure it in there.

633
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,240
True.

634
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,220
You don't need it, anyway.

635
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,480
No.

636
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,700
I don't want that gun.

637
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,060
Do it, coward.

638
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,180
You need more ammo.

639
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,420
I'll do it later, guys.

640
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,180
That's right.

641
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:32,840
Surprise attack.

642
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:33,720
Bitch.

643
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,640
Oh, shit.

644
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,070
Okay.

645
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,250
He didn't see me.

646
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,070
That's right.

647
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:43,430
Surprise.

648
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,370
Surprise flank.

649
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:47,410
Nice.

650
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,690
I don't have enough for...

651
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,870
Hello, guys.

652
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,450
I did it.

653
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,190
Okay, wait.

654
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:54,950
I have ammo.

655
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,650
Okay, you're lucky.

656
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:00,710
I... I was double-checking if I needed...

657
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,730
I was double-checking if I needed more ammo.

658
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,590
If I needed them to be dead.

659
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,930
Protect the little guys.

660
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:12,590
P.S.

661
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,530
They're pretty confident in fights.

662
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,390
Thank you for the super chat.

663
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:16,830
Thank you.

664
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,570
Thank you.

665
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,350
Mmm.

666
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,750
But I'm more confident, though.

667
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,550
But they're kill-stealing me.

668
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,870
Do I really want to let them live if they're kill-stealing?

669
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,530
There we go.

670
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:36,470
Nice.

671
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,370
Alright.

672
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:42,810
Okay.

673
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,690
I get... Oh, my God.

674
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:45,850
Oh, my God.

675
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,350
Okay, I'm just gonna throw my nade out.

676
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,390
There we go.

677
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:50,490
Go get near it.

678
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,230
Don't get near it!

679
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:52,990
Nice.

680
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,010
Wait, you're still alive?

681
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,170
Oh, shit!

682
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,030
Oh!

683
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,930
Okay, I didn't expect... Oh, my God!

684
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:02,670
Okay, that's fine.

685
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:03,530
I have this.

686
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,230
I have that.

687
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,550
I have so many of this.

688
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,490
Oh, nice sticky.

689
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:10,730
Nice sticky.

690
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,920
That's why I did that.

691
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,740
Can I break that shield?

692
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,060
No, I can't.

693
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,580
I was curious if I could.

694
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,120
A secret will happen if you kill five of them.

695
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:28,900
I...

696
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,440
Mmm.

697
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,720
It sounds so believable.

698
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,020
Is there anything here?

699
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,520
I'm gonna throw some nades real quick.

700
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,420
Oh, I'm so dead.

701
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,120
I'm so dead.

702
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,620
My shields.

703
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,200
Wait there!

704
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,040
What the fuck are you doing here?!

705
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,400
Okay.

706
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,160
I actually have to take cover.

707
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,320
That's right.

708
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,720
Suppressing fire!

709
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:58,620
What?

710
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,760
Is... Did he just leave?

711
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,040
Wait, does it actually... Okay, I'm coming back.

712
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,300
Where are they?

713
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:04,980
Alright.

714
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,060
They said it would be a silly secret.

715
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,720
Did I kill five of them?

716
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
I can't tell.

717
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,520
It's been so long.

718
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,580
Hey, where did they all go?

719
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,480
Where did all you guys go?

720
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,280
Where did they all go?

721
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,340
They just all disappeared.

722
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,980
Oh, they are all dead!

723
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,100
Oops.

724
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,920
Clearly it wasn't my fault.

725
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,320
Wait, then what happened to my secret?

726
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,360
I was promised a fun secret.

727
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,940
Very good.

728
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,000
Wait, how do you guys know how many I killed?

729
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,900
How do you guys know that?

730
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,140
Wait, are you keeping track?

731
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,120
What the fuck?!

732
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,700
Oh!

733
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,930
Okay, I thought that he was already dead.

734
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,450
That's why I went up to him.

735
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,330
I don't know why I keep thinking he was dead.

736
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,350
Did I go this way?

737
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,010
No, I did.

738
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,090
I don't know.

739
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,270
It looked like he died.

740
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,210
What does he look like?

741
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,530
Oh, they're cool.

742
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,150
Wait, they're pretty neat and remastered.

743
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,690
It's just so bright.

744
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,010
I don't know why it's...

745
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,910
It's just so bright.

746
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,230
It's weird that it's so bright.

747
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,510
Covenant, on the landing above us.

748
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,590
Firing!

749
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,070
I'm on your side!

750
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,430
Is he dead yet?

751
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,860
Wait, he's not dead!

752
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,100
You guys promised me I could kill them!

753
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,480
What is he for you, you're bad!

754
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,820
Come on, who needs something?

755
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,220
Come on, who needs something?

756
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,560
Why is he still alive?

757
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,740
No, don't you.

758
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,640
I was promised that they would die!

759
00:31:51,220 --> 00:32:04,200
I was promised that they would die!

760
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,700
I mean...

761
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,120
Okay, I'm just gonna...

762
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,860
Just throw all of this...

763
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,740
Right here.

764
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,400
Wait, I think they're all dead.

765
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,680
As in my teammates are dead.

766
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,400
Whoops.

767
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,120
My bad.

768
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,420
My bad.

769
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,900
There we go.

770
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,320
Hello?

771
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,180
Hello?

772
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,300
Oh, there's a scope?

773
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:36,420
Oh!

774
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,320
Oh, there it is!

775
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,360
Why is the scope for the sensitivity so high?

776
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:41,980
There you go.

777
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:43,820
That's right.

778
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,860
Can't get me.

779
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,460
There we go.

780
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,400
Nice.

781
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,180
Okay, so I might have killed...

782
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,980
My teammates.

783
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,920
I am the hero that humanity deserves.

784
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:10,220
I am the hero.

785
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,720
That's right.

786
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,680
That's how Master Chief kept surviving.

787
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,000
If I kill everybody, I'll be the only survivor.

788
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:20,680
Alright.

789
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,500
Go to Skulls tab.

790
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,720
Go to Skulls tab.

791
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:32,760
The reason that Remastered textures are so bright is because they were reused from Halo Reach, which had a lot of outdoor well-lit levels.

792
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,720
343 went the lazy route.

793
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,060
Aw, that's sad.

794
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:36,940
That sucks.

795
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,120
Super chat.

796
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,500
Thank you.

797
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,220
Thank you.

798
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:39,880
Peter.

799
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,620
No witnesses.

800
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,480
Everyone will think I'm the hero if I'm the only one that survives.

801
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:54,250
Wait.

802
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,010
I know what to do.

803
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,630
I can't see where they are.

804
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,270
I know what to do.

805
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,290
At this point, it's a strat.

806
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,890
Oh, I see you.

807
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:07,870
I...

808
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,880
Guys, I need...

809
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,220
I need to use this texture.

810
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,710
Oh, you think I don't see you?

811
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:22,430
Look.

812
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:22,910
See...

813
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:24,750
Oh, you think I don't see you?

814
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,130
There we go.

815
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,250
There we go.

816
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,350
Come on.

817
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:31,870
Peek me.

818
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:35,690
Come on.

819
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,650
Actually, no, let me grab this.

820
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,510
There we go.

821
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,710
Jesus, you're so tanky.

822
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:50,710
Alright.

823
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,610
Oh, whoa.

824
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:53,850
Whoa, little guy.

825
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,890
Get out of here!

826
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:56,890
Oh, wait, hello.

827
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:08,960
Which one?

828
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,180
Which gun?

829
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:10,700
This one?

830
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,160
Wait.

831
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,080
Oh, I like this one.

832
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,020
Wait, this one's nice.

833
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,280
Should I grab this one or...?

834
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,600
I'll grab this.

835
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,740
Wait, I like this gun.

836
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:30,750
Hello?

837
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,050
Any other aliens?

838
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,690
Aliens?

839
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,350
Don't go?

840
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,490
Yeah, you took one for the team.

841
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,990
Actually, it's the tab.

842
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,330
Wait, no, not the left!

843
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,650
Okay, they're a little... they're a little bit dumb.

844
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:53,730
Okay.

845
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:55,370
Nice.

846
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,730
Oh, there it is.

847
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,650
I'm here.

848
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,870
I'm here, Cortana.

849
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,290
Oh.

850
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,350
That's a tight-knit corridor.

851
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:05,970
Not here?

852
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,050
Cortana, where do I go?

853
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,210
Oh, this way.

854
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,490
Oh, it's a maze.

855
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:16,870
Oh.

856
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,070
What's that?

857
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,590
What's the sound, guys?

858
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,550
Is the sound okay so far?

859
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:22,910
I see it.

860
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:24,790
Oh.

861
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,930
Oh, shit!

862
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,030
The fuck was that?

863
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:34,890
Yeah.

864
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,180
That's right.

865
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,400
Here I am.

866
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,400
Oh, no.

867
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,160
Come on, come over here.

868
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,560
Open that door.

869
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,300
That's right.

870
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,500
There's a shotgun?

871
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh, shit!

872
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,240
I think you'll get closer!

873
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,780
You're crazy!

874
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,820
You're fucking crazy!

875
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,340
You got closer!

876
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,540
What's wrong with you?

877
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,940
Oh, bring up the game volume?

878
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:23,240
Okay.

879
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,020
I'll bring up the game volume a little.

880
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,540
For you guys...

881
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,520
Here, and then I'll put up the music a little bit more.

882
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,260
Alright.

883
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,530
Oh, I can charge it?

884
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,750
Wait, no I can't.

885
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,270
How do I charge this?

886
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,450
I don't think this is the one where you can charge.

887
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,850
I'm playing heroic.

888
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,190
Oh my god, I'm lost.

889
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,590
Oh my god.

890
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,430
15 meters to what?

891
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,830
Where am I?

892
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,350
Where am I?

893
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:07,310
Where am I?

894
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,190
Where the fuck...

895
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,630
Where did I come from?

896
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,790
Okay, I came from here.

897
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:13,690
Okay.

898
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,730
And then...

899
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,190
This is where I could go.

900
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,750
Oh my god.

901
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,770
Everything looks the same.

902
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,410
My little mini-map doesn't explain anything.

903
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,150
Here?

904
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,010
No, this is...

905
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,690
No, this is the vent.

906
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,970
This is the vent that I was in.

907
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,140
Oh my god.

908
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,240
Oh my god.

909
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,400
Where am I?

910
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,160
How am I still here?

911
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:49,480
Okay.

912
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,020
Wait, I can't get out?

913
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,840
Wait, what?

914
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,140
I'm trapped?

915
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,320
Hello?

916
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,400
Knock, knock!

917
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,110
Where did I go?

918
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,590
I went backwards.

919
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,790
Where did I come from, chat?

920
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:13,910
I...

921
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,690
I...

922
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,090
I...

923
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,030
I killed so many!

924
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,190
How did you guys navigate this?

925
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,190
What was this?

926
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:34,130
Just all you hear is B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B.

927
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,970
Where did I come from?

928
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,850
Where did I come from?

929
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,510
Where did I come from?

930
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:46,730
Can I jump?

931
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,030
Where is that?

932
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:49,910
Oh my god.

933
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:50,430
There we go.

934
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,570
Cryo B.

935
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,890
Okay, I had to look down.

936
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,850
I figured it out.

937
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:59,130
Oh, I read the instructions on the floor.

938
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:05,390
The South Rifle has a little arrow on the arm, which should point towards your current objective.

939
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,950
Thank you to the Super Chat, Airborne.

940
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:07,710
Thank you, thank you.

941
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,310
Wait, oh.

942
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,070
What the fuck are they doing now?

943
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,530
Okay, we gotta go down.

944
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,070
Thank you, arrows.

945
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,630
Thank you, arrows!

946
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,170
Oh shit, I can't.

947
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,890
Oh my god, I burned my hands.

948
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,010
I burned my hands!

949
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,070
Oh no.

950
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,230
My shields!

951
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:32,970
My hands!

952
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:39,810
Okay.

953
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:45,410
I wanna make sure that... I'm safe here.

954
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,350
Okay, nice.

955
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:48,530
Oh!

956
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,430
Oh!

957
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:55,030
It just exploded randomly!

958
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:58,950
Oh!

959
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:03,490
Okay.

960
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,190
There you go.

961
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,030
I don't think he knew.

962
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,490
I knew you didn't see it.

963
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:18,750
Oh my god, people!

964
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:20,410
Oh my god, humans!

965
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,430
Did I get the secret?

966
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,080
Is that...

967
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,540
Is that five?

968
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,100
Is that...

969
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,240
That's five, right?

970
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,040
Toki, no.

971
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,880
You guys said I get a cool secret, but I killed five!

972
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,560
That's five!

973
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,940
No hesitation.

974
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,860
Toki, what the hell?

975
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,920
I wanna see my cool secret!

976
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,060
Oh my god, they're so scared.

977
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,140
They're so, like, timid.

978
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,300
Like, what's that?

979
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:07,820
Okay.

980
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,600
I said nothing.

981
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,840
You know what you said!

982
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,200
You said there'd be a cool secret!

983
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,760
I'm here for my cool secret!

984
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,860
That was not one guy!

985
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,280
That was not one guy!

986
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,280
You're like, no, he's right!

987
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,020
You're like, no, he's right!

988
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,120
I saw you said he was right!

989
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,100
Hello?

990
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Anybody here?

991
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,940
All right, this way.

992
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,380
Okay.

993
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,080
Nice.

994
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,360
All right.

995
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,400
Wait, is there someone over here?

996
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:53,880
No.

997
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,960
Okay, I gotta make sure.

998
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,300
I gotta make sure I don't get fucking flanked.

999
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,400
Okay, nice.

1000
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,200
Oh my god, I thought I died!

1001
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,260
I thought I died!

1002
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,920
Get in here!

1003
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,340
I need one more to make fit five!

1004
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,820
Oh wait, how many of you?

1005
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,140
One, two, three, four, five!

1006
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,220
One, two, three, four, five!

1007
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,020
I need one more!

1008
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,820
And then it will be five!

1009
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,600
We're gonna make it, aren't we, sir?

1010
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,320
I don't want to lie on you!

1011
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:25,780
I don't want to lie on you!

1012
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,980
Thank you for the magenta soup!

1013
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,220
But thank you, thank you!

1014
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,780
I can't believe my O'Shea war crowned her own comrades!

1015
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,440
In front of the official insignia for the red cross!

1016
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,220
Thank you for the magenta soup!

1017
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,560
But thank you, thank you!

1018
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,080
Finally, my family of five is here!

1019
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,880
The secret is that they shoot now!

1020
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,160
Spare the tiny green men, I beg you!

1021
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,280
Halo, thank you for the super chat!

1022
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,460
Thank you, thank you!

1023
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,280
Hahaha!

1024
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,160
If I still had fingers, they'd be crossed!

1025
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,800
This guy's like, please stop shooting them!

1026
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,840
They have families!

1027
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,900
Okay, the sound balancing for...

1028
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,040
The Halo...

1029
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,200
Like, remaster for this is, like, pretty ass, I'll say that!

1030
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:40,470
I'll raise it up!

1031
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,350
Wait, how many?

1032
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:03,250
One, two, three!

1033
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,690
Are you guys...?

1034
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,390
Oh...

1035
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:09,350
Yeah, no, they definitely look dead-dead...

1036
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:09,930
Hahaha!

1037
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,210
Hahaha!

1038
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:14,950
Hahaha!

1039
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:15,050
Hahaha!

1040
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:15,470
Hahaha!

1041
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,410
Yeah, they definitely look dead...

1042
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:19,690
No!

1043
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:21,110
My five kills!

1044
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:26,910
Alright, let's...

1045
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:27,730
Let me raise the...

1046
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,030
There's nothing we can do!

1047
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,730
Alright, I'll put it at a hundred and see if that fixes it.

1048
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,120
Alright...

1049
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,020
I still have...

1050
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:37,240
Aww!

1051
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,000
I don't have...

1052
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,100
Get to keep my alien gun!

1053
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,340
What does it look like?

1054
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:41,680
Ooh!

1055
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,420
What's so bright?

1056
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:45,800
Whoa!

1057
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,600
Okay!

1058
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,700
Okay, we'll go this way.

1059
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,820
I guess, like...

1060
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,600
We gotta find five more.

1061
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,260
I assume I have to go across from here, right?

1062
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,400
Yeah, I heard...

1063
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,600
Pistol's the best weapon.

1064
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,380
Alright, and thank you for the super chat!

1065
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,080
Thank you, thank you!

1066
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,240
For just one dollar!

1067
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,540
You can donate!

1068
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,040
To support your local marines and keep them safe from...

1069
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,380
Don't eat abuse!

1070
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,020
Thank you for the super chat!

1071
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,000
Thank you, thank you!

1072
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:24,900
Oh, wait!

1073
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,000
That looks like the enemy!

1074
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,320
That looks like the enemy!

1075
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,380
It's hard to go up.

1076
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,340
Wait, what the fuck?

1077
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,940
It made a child!

1078
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,340
Whoa!

1079
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:40,840
Whoa!

1080
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,860
What's shooting me?!

1081
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,060
What the fuck?!

1082
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,780
It can shoot me?!

1083
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,600
Oh my god, this is bullshit!

1084
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,000
I have to fight a plane?!

1085
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,030
Oh my god, it shoots back!

1086
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,440
Are you serious?

1087
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,320
Are you seri- Oh my god, bro.

1088
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,200
I'm barely a person right now.

1089
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,200
I'm like one tiny fly in your- In your world.

1090
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:18,900
Okay.

1091
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:19,700
Yeah.

1092
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:22,900
There we go.

1093
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,220
I don't wanna deal with these guys.

1094
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,160
These guys are annoying.

1095
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,580
No, I have shields.

1096
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,960
These guys are so annoying.

1097
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:33,940
I just have to play cover.

1098
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:35,740
There we go.

1099
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:35,760
There we go.

1100
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,580
Give me your gun.

1101
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,920
Is this a- Okay, yeah.

1102
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:41,700
These are the good one.

1103
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:44,480
Nice and naked.

1104
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,420
What the fuck?!

1105
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,240
How are you alive?!

1106
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,840
I killed your entire family!

1107
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:48,680
Get out of here!

1108
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,540
Pistol whip!

1109
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,620
All right.

1110
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,380
Come where I'll find the rest of your family.

1111
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:57,460
I'm sorry.

1112
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,120
Betty, thank you for the super chat.

1113
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,180
Thank you, thank you.

1114
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,160
Fame, thank you for the super chat.

1115
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,040
Thank you, thank you.

1116
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,300
Anyone else in the chat playing along with Doki at the same time?

1117
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,520
Thank you for the stream, boss.

1118
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,180
Thank you for the super chat.

1119
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,080
Thank you, thank you.

1120
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,220
Hello, did anyone survive?

1121
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,560
Oh wait, that does...

1122
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:26,090
Who's shooting back at me?

1123
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:26,910
Oh my god, is this shit.

1124
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,030
Wait, is there five of them?

1125
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,040
Let's get rid of the tiny guys first.

1126
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,340
And then we'll help them out.

1127
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,620
Alright, where's the big guy?

1128
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,500
Oh shit, he turned back!

1129
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,040
I didn't think he'd turn back!

1130
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,520
I was trying to do a flank!

1131
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,180
Medic!

1132
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,100
Good to see you, sir!

1133
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,280
Welcome to the party!

1134
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,080
No problem.

1135
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,100
It's a mess, sir.

1136
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,060
We're scouting all over this valley.

1137
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,740
We called for evac, but until you showed up, I thought we were cooked.

1138
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,660
Don't worry, Sergeant.

1139
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,900
We'll stay here until evac arrives.

1140
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,040
Heads up!

1141
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,000
Alright, no problem.

1142
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,480
No, I'm taking it!

1143
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,060
Sorry!

1144
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:27,660
I just... How was I supposed to know he could die from one singular pistol whip!

1145
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,440
I didn't kill Johnson!

1146
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,400
He's right here!

1147
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,120
I made sure to... Make sure to keep him alive!

1148
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,480
I kept him alive!

1149
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,420
Guys, look, I did one good thing.

1150
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,900
I get one.

1151
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,920
You're super silky.

1152
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,520
You should've made more!

1153
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,060
It's not my fault!

1154
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,620
Oh my god, I thought it'd be further.

1155
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,520
Not gonna lie.

1156
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:05,170
Come on.

1157
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,280
Okay.

1158
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,220
Wait, what's shooting me?

1159
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,440
Oh my god, he's right here.

1160
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:12,760
I'm dead.

1161
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,160
I'm dead.

1162
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,080
I'm actually dead.

1163
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,880
I'm so low.

1164
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,060
I'm so low right now.

1165
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,260
Oh my god.

1166
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,270
Look, see, they're all alive.

1167
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:26,270
Look, Johnson!

1168
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,470
Sergeant Johnson alive!

1169
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:28,330
Look at him go!

1170
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:31,950
Oh.

1171
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,490
Oh, wait, that's... Oh, fuck.

1172
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,200
Sergeant Johnson.

1173
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:48,580
Oh, no!

1174
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,340
Sergeant Johnson, wake up!

1175
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,640
Wake up, Sergeant Johnson!

1176
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,040
Wake up!

1177
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,160
You were clearly very important to the story!

1178
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,220
I thought he

1179
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:10,800
was...

1180
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,260
Yeah, it's me.

1181
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,260
He'll be back, right, guys?

1182
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,100
Guys, where's the medic?

1183
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,320
Guys!

1184
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,360
Medic!

1185
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:22,960
Medic!

1186
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,880
Oh my god.

1187
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:28,700
Got him!

1188
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,240
Okay.

1189
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:33,960
Alright.

1190
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,120
I mean, you can get... you can kill him if you want.

1191
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,540
I really don't care enough.

1192
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,560
Oh my god.

1193
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,420
I hear them.

1194
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,060
I hear these little fuckers running around.

1195
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:52,680
Get out of here.

1196
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,460
Get out!

1197
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,460
He was the medic!

1198
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,480
Oh, hey!

1199
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,220
That's a new gun!

1200
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,020
New gun!

1201
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:01,300
Oh, wait.

1202
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,480
It dropped.

1203
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,040
It died.

1204
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,100
Wait.

1205
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:08,720
Me?

1206
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,960
There's only me and you.

1207
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,820
Oh, you're so lucky.

1208
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:18,100
You're so...

1209
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:18,500
Over here!

1210
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,000
Oh my god!

1211
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:22,660
There's health here!

1212
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,260
Thank god.

1213
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,560
Wait.

1214
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,360
There's armor and health up top?

1215
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,940
I don't need that, though.

1216
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:37,800
Jesus!

1217
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:38,820
There's so many!

1218
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:46,640
Alright.

1219
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,280
Wait.

1220
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:47,960
Oh my god!

1221
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,940
The ship is still shooting me?!

1222
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:55,510
Okay.

1223
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:57,610
Where's the last guy?

1224
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:01,610
Where is he?

1225
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:03,250
Oh, there he is.

1226
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,110
Get out of here!

1227
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:07,890
Get out of here!

1228
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:09,930
Alright.

1229
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,570
There we go.

1230
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,450
There's still more?!

1231
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,220
Where are they?!

1232
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,440
What the?!

1233
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,140
You are dead?!

1234
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:29,060
How many are there?!

1235
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,760
Who and her?

1236
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:31,100
How many are there?!

1237
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,620
It's just me and him!

1238
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:33,700
There it is!

1239
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,370
I'm actually the last man alive.

1240
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:04,890
There it is!

1241
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:05,310
No witnesses.

1242
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:09,410
What do you mean it's my fault?!

1243
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:12,470
I did everything I could.

1244
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,130
I didn't even kill him.

1245
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,030
I wanted to.

1246
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:18,290
I didn't even kill him.

1247
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:22,290
I restrained myself.

1248
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:27,290
Like, shoot his fucking hands or some shit?

1249
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,960
I did my best.

1250
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,320
I'm alive.

1251
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,900
What?

1252
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:47,220
What?

1253
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:47,520
What?

1254
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:47,540
What?

1255
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:48,020
What?

1256
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:48,460
What?

1257
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,480
Thank you.

1258
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,980
More lifeboats?

1259
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:00,790
Wait.

1260
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:01,630
Nice.

1261
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:05,050
That's good.

1262
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,320
We have reinforcements.

1263
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,420
Wait.

1264
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,100
Are they gonna drive away?

1265
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,100
Oh, no.

1266
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:24,000
Oh.

1267
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,700
Oh, no.

1268
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,700
Okay, I can do this.

1269
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,640
I can do this.

1270
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,040
Alright, I believe in you.

1271
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,260
Oh, no.

1272
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,560
I don't know where to go.

1273
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:40,760
Where am I?

1274
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,840
Sir, where am I supposed to drive?

1275
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,320
Is that Cliff?

1276
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,940
Oh, down here.

1277
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:53,640
Okay.

1278
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,040
I must be here.

1279
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:57,040
If there is a road, there is a way.

1280
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,920
Will he drive for me?

1281
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:00,320
Okay.

1282
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:02,540
Drive.

1283
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,120
Drive.

1284
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,680
That's right.

1285
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,240
I shoot.

1286
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,040
Drive!

1287
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:12,840
Drive!

1288
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:19,860
Okay.

1289
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,800
I guess I'll drive.

1290
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:27,690
Get in the car!

1291
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,260
Oh, my God.

1292
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,440
He doesn't drive anymore.

1293
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,060
Hey.

1294
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:33,700
Oh, wait, wait.

1295
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,500
Oh, my God.

1296
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:36,760
There's no way.

1297
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,780
Oh, my God.

1298
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,600
Are you leaving?

1299
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:39,940
Oh, thank God.

1300
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:40,240
Okay.

1301
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,480
Thank God.

1302
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,440
Wait.

1303
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,780
I don't think this is the right...

1304
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,620
Wait, this is the right path.

1305
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,240
There it is.

1306
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:51,680
How did I honk the horn?

1307
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,460
That's right.

1308
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,200
Watch this.

1309
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,580
Where am I?

1310
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,880
The fuck is this place?

1311
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,200
This...

1312
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,240
What is this?

1313
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:20,180
Where...

1314
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:21,940
Where am I?

1315
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,720
The dialogue?

1316
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,240
Yeah, I don't know how to fix it.

1317
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:28,720
The...

1318
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,160
Whoa.

1319
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:32,960
Whoa.

1320
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:34,780
Whoa!

1321
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:38,370
Holy shit.

1322
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:39,390
Oh, my God.

1323
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:40,290
I don't know where I am.

1324
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,650
I don't know where I am.

1325
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:42,890
I'm in this weird portal.

1326
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:44,770
There's so many people.

1327
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:45,330
There's so many people.

1328
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:46,010
No.

1329
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:46,310
No.

1330
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:46,870
Back up.

1331
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:47,470
Back up.

1332
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:50,760
Back...

1333
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:54,640
Go.

1334
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,440
Shoot him.

1335
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,360
Shoot him.

1336
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,820
Holy fuck.

1337
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,940
I almost drove off.

1338
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,600
I almost drove off.

1339
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,760
But I'm okay.

1340
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,980
I'm okay, everyone.

1341
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:05,320
I'm okay.

1342
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,540
So close.

1343
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,540
It's okay.

1344
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:11,900
We're all okay.

1345
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:12,840
There it is.

1346
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,350
Where the fuck is this area?

1347
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,990
I don't think I'm supposed to be here.

1348
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:24,430
Nice and smooth now.

1349
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:28,940
Come get some.

1350
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:29,960
I'll slowly run over...

1351
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:30,680
Run them over.

1352
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,200
Come and take your medicine.

1353
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,540
Alright, nice.

1354
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:35,940
I am?

1355
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,880
Where do I go after here?

1356
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,040
I killed them all.

1357
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,040
Oh, maybe...

1358
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:44,660
Oh, I see it.

1359
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:45,280
I see it.

1360
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:52,420
Worth it.

1361
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,600
It's so worth it.

1362
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,220
Alright, I gotta get out.

1363
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,700
Oh my god, I'm stuck.

1364
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,060
I'm stuck.

1365
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:01,360
Okay.

1366
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:02,600
There we go.

1367
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,740
It has to be here.

1368
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,320
There's something over here that I can't go through.

1369
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:11,020
What?

1370
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,040
What?

1371
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:12,340
What?

1372
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:12,860
What?

1373
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:16,430
Okay, there we go.

1374
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:17,570
We're okay.

1375
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:19,570
We're okay.

1376
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:20,070
We're okay.

1377
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:24,350
Nope, I parked my car.

1378
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:25,410
We should be good.

1379
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:28,510
Alright.

1380
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:30,730
Let's press this button.

1381
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:36,900
Button press.

1382
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:45,890
Oh, I know it's speed when we're up with the car, apparently.

1383
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,290
For the last level or something.

1384
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:49,530
I saw it on the...

1385
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:50,950
Uh, SGDDQD...

1386
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:52,850
BCD...

1387
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:53,730
Where...

1388
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:54,510
Where you can get...

1389
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:55,690
Use the car to do the...

1390
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:57,110
The speed run or some shit.

1391
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:58,210
For the last level.

1392
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:03,770
Oh my god, now I can cross.

1393
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:05,370
Don't worry, I parked my car.

1394
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,090
There's fall...

1395
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:13,350
Okay.

1396
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:15,310
At least now I know there's fall damage.

1397
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:17,070
Um...

1398
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:19,090
Let's hope...

1399
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:31,170
Let's...

1400
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:31,730
Okay.

1401
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:32,470
Wait.

1402
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:33,510
Wait, okay.

1403
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:34,430
Okay, wait.

1404
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:35,070
No, I'm okay.

1405
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:35,650
I'm okay.

1406
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:36,470
Everything...

1407
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:37,890
It's okay, guys.

1408
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:38,730
It's okay.

1409
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:40,310
It's a little tight, but it's okay.

1410
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:42,850
It's okay.

1411
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:43,110
We got...

1412
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:43,490
Yay!

1413
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:45,710
It's low...

1414
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,550
It's lowly and steady.

1415
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,240
We did it.

1416
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,540
We did it.

1417
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:57,980
Yay!

1418
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,260
I wonder if there's a way to boost the vol...

1419
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,680
The dialogue up.

1420
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,240
A lot more crew made it off the autumn than I had predicted.

1421
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,000
I have to not drive the hero.

1422
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:12,020
I have to not drive the hero.

1423
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:14,260
Okay.

1424
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,340
We can find...

1425
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,660
We're gonna find the survivors.

1426
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,940
We have a chance to coordinate an effective resistance.

1427
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,180
I wonder if there's a way to boost up the...

1428
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,140
I feel like the game volume...

1429
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,220
The game volume and the...

1430
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:29,820
Uh...

1431
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:32,940
I feel like the effects volume in the voice chat...

1432
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:33,160
Yeah.

1433
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,400
The...

1434
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,800
That's crazy.

1435
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:36,480
Okay.

1436
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:37,680
Maybe the effects...

1437
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,640
If I lower the effects...

1438
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:39,360
Maybe?

1439
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:40,740
Because I think...

1440
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:43,020
The game volume is tied to the...

1441
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:43,400
Game...

1442
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:44,220
The...

1443
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:44,800
The dialogue.

1444
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:50,680
Okay.

1445
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,320
Maybe that's how we can do it.

1446
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:54,340
Yeah.

1447
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,180
Oh my god.

1448
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,080
This is so...

1449
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,640
This is so clunky.

1450
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,300
This is so clunky.

1451
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,520
The trap.

1452
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:13,360
Reunion tour?

1453
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,760
We're reunioning with?

1454
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:16,520
They're all dead.

1455
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:27,400
Oh menu music is tied to the cutscene music?

1456
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:27,860
Okay.

1457
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:28,460
I'll do that.

1458
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,220
Sorry guys.

1459
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:30,780
I'm sorry for the lack of...

1460
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:31,200
I'm sorry.

1461
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:32,300
Okay.

1462
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,220
Ba-dam.

1463
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,240
Ba-dam.

1464
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:46,260
Ba-dam.

1465
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:46,680
Wait.

1466
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,140
Where are you guys seeing the lifeboat?

1467
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:54,760
Oh shit.

1468
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,440
That car won't brake, right?

1469
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,320
What's that?

1470
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,300
What is that?

1471
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,900
Where are they seeing the light...

1472
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,940
Oh, is it behind me?

1473
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:14,440
Oh!

1474
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,540
Is it quieter?

1475
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,400
There's no way.

1476
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,140
Effects is tied?

1477
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,980
Oh my god, it is!

1478
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:37,410
The effects and the...

1479
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,580
That's crazy!

1480
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,840
Okay, that's actually fucking weird.

1481
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,700
Is it behind me?

1482
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,000
I don't see the lifeboat.

1483
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,480
Oh!

1484
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:06,560
There we go.

1485
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:08,900
Oh wait, there's something up here.

1486
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,740
What's up here?

1487
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,810
There's beacon lights here.

1488
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,240
What's over here?

1489
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:29,040
There's people.

1490
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:36,370
Don't worry!

1491
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:37,950
I'm a hero!

1492
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:43,730
Oh shit!

1493
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:47,230
Don't worry, the hero's here!

1494
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:50,430
Oh my god!

1495
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:51,530
Okay, give me a sec.

1496
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:52,790
Give me a sec.

1497
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:54,750
I'm trying to...

1498
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:56,590
Oh hey, here's...

1499
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:57,210
Oh!

1500
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:58,130
Don't die!

1501
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:01,610
I'm trying my best!

1502
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:06,740
I'm trying my best!

1503
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,020
This is very, very...

1504
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:09,560
Okay, let me get out of here.

1505
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:10,720
Alright, don't die.

1506
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:13,900
Don't die while I get ammo from these dead bodies.

1507
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:15,600
Yay.

1508
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:20,790
Alright.

1509
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:22,410
Does anyone see us?

1510
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:24,950
Yeah, I see you guys!

1511
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:26,090
How do I get up here?

1512
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:27,990
Hello!

1513
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:29,270
It's him!

1514
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:30,490
That's me!

1515
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:31,270
I'm John Halo!

1516
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:32,610
Alright!

1517
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:35,010
Yeah, it's me!

1518
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:39,070
There's a lifeboat?

1519
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:43,460
Where is he?

1520
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:44,020
Is he up here?

1521
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:46,380
Hello!

1522
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,120
Is that you?

1523
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:51,940
Oh, is that him?

1524
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,100
Wait, if I kill him, do I get a sniper?

1525
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:22,720
Cool.

1526
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,020
You could have got one for free!

1527
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:53,600
But okay!

1528
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,500
Guys, but I got a coin sniper!

1529
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,600
Watch this!

1530
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,000
Ooh!

1531
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:10,580
Okay.

1532
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:13,900
Nice.

1533
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:17,180
I saw nothing.

1534
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,840
Wait, but where is the lifeboat?

1535
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,340
Where is it?

1536
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:24,300
Wait, is my car okay?

1537
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,560
Oh, it's that thing!

1538
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:27,380
Whoops.

1539
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,340
It's okay, now I have two.

1540
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,540
Guys, it's good.

1541
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,340
Because now...

1542
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:38,820
That's...

1543
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:39,440
That's okay.

1544
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:40,860
Because now...

1545
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:43,860
Guys, now...

1546
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,820
Now I can get more sniper ammo.

1547
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,800
And where I believe my team will be okay.

1548
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:55,940
Oh, he's dead.

1549
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:56,900
Oh, he's dead.

1550
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:56,940
No, he's okay.

1551
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:57,640
There it is.

1552
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,080
Where is it?

1553
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:00,500
Oh, there it is!

1554
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:01,780
I got more sniper ammo.

1555
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:02,320
Look at that!

1556
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:06,960
Now I got...

1557
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,280
Now I got more sniper ammo, guys.

1558
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,160
Are you guys all safe now?

1559
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,840
Now I have more sniper ammo.

1560
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,980
I'm not...

1561
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:24,140
Guys!

1562
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:25,820
Just one guy.

1563
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:25,860
What?

1564
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,960
I also make sure there's no witnesses.

1565
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:40,840
There's always been five.

1566
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,680
We could also make sure...

1567
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,540
He died...

1568
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:52,920
Exactly.

1569
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:53,900
He died for...

1570
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:54,140
Okay.

1571
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,760
My gunner is definitely dead.

1572
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:58,640
I may or may not have actually got him killed there.

1573
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,000
I...

1574
01:08:59,600 --> 01:08:59,860
Wait!

1575
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:01,260
Nice shot.

1576
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,580
Here we go.

1577
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:14,540
Okay.

1578
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:15,640
I think I got all of them.

1579
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:16,440
See, there's always...

1580
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:17,200
Wait, he's back!

1581
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:18,000
Look!

1582
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,020
See, I told you!

1583
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:20,280
Look at that!

1584
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,520
He didn't die!

1585
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:23,740
I see him!

1586
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:29,790
Look at that guy!

1587
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:30,590
Oh!

1588
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:30,670
No!

1589
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,110
Oh no!

1590
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:35,370
Sergeant Johnson!

1591
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:38,890
No!

1592
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:40,730
Not again!

1593
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:43,910
Guys, he's napping.

1594
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:48,270
Guys, Sergeant Johnson is just taking a long vacation.

1595
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:51,370
He deserves it.

1596
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:56,090
Guys, Sergeant Johnson has been through a lot, guys.

1597
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,010
Oh no.

1598
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:03,370
Where the fuck?

1599
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:04,130
Oh, did I kill him?

1600
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:04,550
Nice.

1601
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:08,750
Taking another power nap.

1602
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:09,690
It's okay.

1603
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:11,850
Just taking a nap, guys.

1604
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:14,450
This is a well-deserved vacation.

1605
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:16,870
He's a hero, guys.

1606
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:19,070
He's a fucking hero.

1607
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:25,780
Alright.

1608
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,040
We're fine.

1609
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,020
See you guys?

1610
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:30,180
We're a-okay.

1611
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:31,600
What the fuck?

1612
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,300
Okay.

1613
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:34,020
See guys?

1614
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,820
There's always been four.

1615
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:37,100
Echo 419.

1616
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,560
We read you Echo 419.

1617
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:40,660
Okay.

1618
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,460
Check it to- Cypher Society.

1619
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,020
Proof for the science of super- For her.

Cause thank you for the super chat.

1621

Thank you.

1622
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:48,900
Thank you.

1623
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,160
One near the cliff edge.

1624
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,060
And another near the- Hey, you're going to wildfire at head level?

1625
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,800
To see from my altitude bang.

1626
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,500
I don't trust you.

1627
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,820
I- I- Oh wait.

1628
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:09,080
Look.

1629
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:09,300
See?

1630
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,540
Everybody's rescued.

1631
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,120
I did it.

1632
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:14,440
There's always been four.

1633
01:11:18,610 --> 01:11:19,890
For democracy.

1634
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:21,130
For super-Earth.

1635
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,800
Goodbye, my four survivors.

1636
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:28,500
Goodbye.

1637
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,620
I did it.

1638
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,240
There's always been four.

1639
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:36,540
It's always my- Oh, he's still alive!

1640
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,100
Oh my god!

1641
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,360
Now I have two of them!

1642
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,080
Look at that!

1643
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:43,750
God showed up.

1644
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:45,050
But let's go.

1645
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:46,430
Oh my god!

1646
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:50,170
He found- He- Mitosis, guys!

1647
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:54,370
I- I- Oh my god!

1648
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,350
He fucking mitosis!

1649
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:00,900
Hail it.

1650
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:04,780
He made a new friend.

1651
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,040
Oh nice, there's more ammo.

1652
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:07,720
Thank god.

1653
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,540
Who's one shot?

1654
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:10,980
Wait, how do you know they're one shot?

1655
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:16,840
How do you guys know that?

1656
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,440
What does it say?

1657
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,040
How do you guys- Oh, there we go.

1658
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:22,880
No, I see it.

1659
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:24,940
I see it.

1660
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:25,840
Oh yeah, no.

1661
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,020
He's definitely slow.

1662
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:30,420
I don't give him- Can I give them HP?

1663
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:34,380
Oops.

1664
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,120
It's alright.

1665
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,540
He'll live for like one- One day.

1666
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,400
That's all I need.

1667
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:44,000
Also, has the volume been up better?

1668
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,100
I know the vo- Dialogue is really bad.

1669
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,800
But like, I- I don't know how- There's no way to fix that.

1670
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,900
Sorry, give me a sec.

1671
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:01,820
Whoops.

1672
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:06,690
Don't worry, I can fix this.

1673
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:07,430
Wait.

1674
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:14,430
Oh, thank god.

1675
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:14,890
Okay.

1676
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:15,950
Get in.

1677
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:17,970
Get in guys.

1678
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:19,130
No, okay.

1679
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:19,630
Guys.

1680
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:20,170
Okay.

1681
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:24,130
I don't want my gunner to be the one with zero HP.

1682
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,480
Oh my god.

1683
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:30,780
Okay.

1684
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:32,020
Guys, you should stay here.

1685
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,300
Guys, stay here.

1686
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:41,900
No, you are literally gonna die if I don't do anything about it.

1687
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:45,400
Okay.

1688
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,820
Alright, I gotta make sure these big guys are dead.

1689
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,040
Alright, it's time.

1690
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:01,420
Are you guys ready?

1691
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,560
Alright, here we go.

1692
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,020
More of them.

1693
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:06,280
Go do your thing.

1694
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:07,480
Back me up.

1695
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:09,820
Give me a sec.

1696
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:10,880
Give me a sec.

1697
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,640
I gotta make sure I don't slam into this tree.

1698
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,280
I'm doing it.

1699
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:18,980
Oh!

1700
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,040
Alright.

1701
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:29,560
Oh, I'm trying to- I'm trying to get over the hills!

1702
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:34,400
Oh my god, there's the marines.

1703
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:35,600
Alright.

1704
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:35,680
Alright.

1705
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,680
You guys got this.

1706
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:39,160
We've got wounded here.

1707
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,620
I'll call in and drop ship to pick them up.

1708
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:42,720
Don't worry, I got you!

1709
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:43,760
Damn it, they're everywhere!

1710
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:44,520
Lay those!

1711
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:44,920
Lay those!

1712
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:45,040
Lay those!

1713
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:46,760
I see them!

1714
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:49,040
Alright, nice.

1715
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,220
Okay, and then we get rid of the tiny guys.

1716
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:54,920
Alright, you stay here!

1717
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:55,500
I believe!

1718
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:01,470
Is that it?

1719
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:02,390
What was that?

1720
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:03,390
Wait, no, there's two over here.

1721
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:06,670
Alright, now he's dead.

1722
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:07,030
Hey!

1723
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:08,470
Thanks, guys.

1724
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:10,330
I know.

1725
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:16,130
Alright, we gotta wait for- We gotta wait for a ship.

1726
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:18,030
Oh, I can?

1727
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:19,730
How do I zoom in a second time?

1728
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:22,790
Oh wait, is it the sniper?

1729
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:23,570
Over here!

1730
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:26,010
Oh, okay, there we go.

1731
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:30,290
Okay.

1732
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:34,090
Okay, I'm not used to zooming in a second time, clearly.

1733
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:35,070
Oh, you like that?

1734
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:39,110
I'm not used to it.

1735
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:41,370
Here we go.

1736
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:46,030
Okay, now it's just the babies.

1737
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:48,490
I have that one!

1738
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:49,890
No, you did not!

1739
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:57,190
I- the closer they are, the- the harder it was to shoot them, apparently.

1740
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:03,510
Over

1741
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:09,820
here!

1742
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:10,600
Yeah!

1743
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,880
We're going to look for the last lifeboat, Echo 419.

1744
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:15,300
Oh, I have to find one more person.

1745
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:16,360
Wow!

1746
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:17,620
It's taller than I thought.

1747
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:18,780
Oh my god!

1748
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:19,080
Wait!

1749
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,420
No, there's no Sergeant Johnson.

1750
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:22,720
Look, I did it, guys.

1751
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,420
I'm a hero.

1752
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:26,100
I told you I can save everyone.

1753
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,400
He did die!

1754
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:29,240
I did it!

1755
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,720
Careful, everyone.

1756
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:31,660
She's a hero.

1757
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:36,690
Okay.

1758
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:40,350
I need to figure out where the last one is.

1759
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,040
Give me a sec.

1760
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:48,740
There's more rifle?

1761
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,440
Alright, you guys will be safe.

1762
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:51,620
I trust you guys.

1763
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:55,180
I need more- I need more sniper rifle ammo.

1764
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:56,900
Where would it be?

1765
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,020
There's ammo by this rock?

1766
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:02,640
This one?

1767
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,200
Guys, this entire area is just rocks.

1768
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,680
You gotta be more specific.

1769
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,560
Which rock?

1770
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:09,960
Oh, this rock!

1771
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,400
Is it because he's dead?

1772
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:13,440
I know.

1773
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,340
You only got my- Thank you for your service.

1774
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:22,140
Alright.

1775
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:23,940
There you go.

1776
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,040
Where did I park my car?

1777
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,240
There I did.

1778
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:27,740
There I did.

1779
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:29,260
Alright.

1780
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:34,500
This is an- It's an honorable teabag, guys.

1781
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,060
I gave him what he's always wanted.

1782
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:39,900
What the?

1783
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:41,380
What?

1784
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,500
You can't hide from me!

1785
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:43,880
Roger that!

1786
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:44,280
There's more?

1787
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:47,080
Oh my god.

1788
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,200
There might be more ammo here.

1789
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:53,180
Alright.

1790
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,620
Let me grab this real quick.

1791
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:57,520
Alright.

1792
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:58,500
Give me a sec, man.

1793
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:01,220
Gotta grab some more ammo.

1794
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:02,060
Go!

1795
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:02,420
Go!

1796
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:02,800
Go!

1797
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:03,860
Oh shit, never mind.

1798
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:04,620
Wrong way.

1799
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:06,080
Alright.

1800
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:06,880
Get back in here.

1801
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,140
Get in here!

1802
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:10,220
Guys!

1803
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:11,720
Get in here!

1804
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,060
Oh nice, they swapped places.

1805
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:13,600
That's good.

1806
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:17,160
Where else would they be?

1807
01:18:20,850 --> 01:18:21,250
Alright.

1808
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:22,030
Go back up.

1809
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:27,200
Oh, with the last...

1810
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,980
Oh, I- I didn't kill that guy?

1811
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:35,680
Okay, there we go.

1812
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:37,640
Nah, I killed that guy.

1813
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,600
I'm missing one more area.

1814
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:40,920
Morning.

1815
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:45,700
I picked up reports that the Covenant has located and secured the Pillar of Autumn's crash site.

1816
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:55,570
Oh, there's lights here!

1817
01:18:57,690 --> 01:18:58,210
Alright.

1818
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:00,570
That has to be the last one.

1819
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:05,170
Oh!

1820
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:07,370
Wait, no, didn't I go here?

1821
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:10,390
Was I here before?

1822
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:18,960
I think so.

1823
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:22,480
I don't remember.

1824
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,760
Okay, let's try this area.

1825
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:25,760
I'm lost again.

1826
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,740
Yeah, this is where I- I rescued four people.

1827
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:31,200
Yeah, it was here.

1828
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:32,400
Okay, I went here already.

1829
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:34,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1830
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:38,700
I- I- The one where I rescued all four of them.

1831
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,440
Oh, there it is!

1832
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,060
I see it!

1833
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:40,700
It's over here!

1834
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:45,910
I see it.

1835
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:47,630
This was the first area I didn't go to.

1836
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:49,230
Wee!

1837
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:51,670
Whoops.

1838
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:53,530
Don't worry, y'all.

1839
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:54,310
It's still alive.

1840
01:19:55,650 --> 01:19:56,970
Why are you complaining?

1841
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:58,490
You're both still alive!

1842
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:03,550
Look, if you think you're such a good driver, why don't you drive this?

1843
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:04,750
Come on, Florida!

1844
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:08,750
There's always been four.

1845
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:12,710
Okay, it's this way.

1846
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:20,490
Right here.

1847
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:23,810
Oh my god!

1848
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:25,210
Oh!

1849
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:29,110
I shall run you over!

1850
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:30,430
Ah!

1851
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:34,410
That's right!

1852
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,090
Get back here!

1853
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:37,450
Oh, okay.

1854
01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:38,650
I mean, that works too.

1855
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:39,570
Yeah, man!

1856
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:43,430
But there's nothing here.

1857
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:47,290
Wait, that's just a cliff.

1858
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,290
So, maybe I am.

1859
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:53,670
Wait!

1860
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:54,570
No, I haven't been here!

1861
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:55,050
Here, here!

1862
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:55,590
This is it!

1863
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:57,030
This is where I haven't been!

1864
01:20:57,490 --> 01:20:58,110
That's right!

1865
01:20:59,030 --> 01:20:59,330
Oh!

1866
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:01,390
Right?

1867
01:21:01,810 --> 01:21:03,850
Let me run you over into that rock!

1868
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:08,050
I figured it out, guys.

1869
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:12,230
Now I know I'm in the right area.

1870
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:15,970
No, I'm not blind!

1871
01:21:16,130 --> 01:21:17,090
I figured it out!

1872
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:38,170
Oh!

1873
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:38,510
Oh, shit!

1874
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:39,530
There's an arrow down!

1875
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:41,170
Oh, thank god!

1876
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:41,650
Okay!

1877
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:44,010
I figured...

1878
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:44,570
Oh, there!

1879
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:45,130
Missed!

1880
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:46,310
The one hole!

1881
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:47,430
Okay, sorry.

1882
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:48,410
I missed the hole!

1883
01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:49,090
Oh, no!

1884
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:51,030
They got...

1885
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:52,150
They added a marker!

1886
01:21:52,730 --> 01:21:53,510
Oh my god!

1887
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:54,390
Okay!

1888
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:57,310
It was the one hole that I was missing.

1889
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:00,370
Okay, now I figured it out.

1890
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:05,630
Okay.

1891
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:11,070
More of a way!

1892
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:12,410
Okay, now we go for it.

1893
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:17,150
Okay, things will be okay.

1894
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:18,750
We got...

1895
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:19,030
Woo!

1896
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:21,150
That's a wrap!

1897
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:25,310
Alright.

1898
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:27,470
We just gotta...

1899
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:28,490
Okay, we gotta...

1900
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:30,050
Find a parking spot, man!

1901
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:32,170
We gotta find a parking spot!

1902
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:32,810
Right here!

1903
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:35,890
A little parking spot!

1904
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,000
That's fine!

1905
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:50,350
Oh, shit.

1906
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:53,510
Here we go.

1907
01:22:55,990 --> 01:22:56,750
Hello.

1908
01:22:58,210 --> 01:22:58,970
Get...

1909
01:22:58,970 --> 01:23:00,090
Get out of here!

1910
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:03,170
Alright.

1911
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:04,090
Nice.

1912
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:09,980
How the fuck did you dodge that?

1913
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:13,890
Wait.

1914
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:14,390
What?

1915
01:23:16,590 --> 01:23:17,690
Oh my...

1916
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:21,380
I grazed his ear!

1917
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,020
Here we go.

1918
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:25,360
Come on.

1919
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:27,360
Here we go.

1920
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:29,900
Oh my god.

1921
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,340
That shit actually grazed his ear.

1922
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:31,960
I'm so sad.

1923
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:34,460
We should search the interior of those structures before we leave.

1924
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:35,880
Alright.

1925
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:36,260
Goodbye.

1926
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:42,120
Nice.

1927
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:44,960
I mean, I have a lot of nades.

1928
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:46,520
Ew.

1929
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:51,120
Alright.

1930
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,100
I couldn't bring my car down with me.

1931
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:57,300
Oh my god.

1932
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,000
I almost shot them.

1933
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,200
I've called for an evac.

1934
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:00,740
Roger that.

1935
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:00,860
Roger that.

1936
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:01,320
Hey guys.

1937
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:01,720
Marines!

1938
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,220
Assemble for evac.

1939
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:03,920
Pronto!

1940
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:06,080
I'm here to help you.

1941
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:06,840
Oh fuck!

1942
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:07,800
What the fuck?

1943
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,600
They just shoot each other!

1944
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:34,200
Oh my god.

1945
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:34,980
Oh no.

1946
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:36,160
Oh no.

1947
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:41,730
There's nothing over here!

1948
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:43,890
Okay.

1949
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:46,070
I sort of accidentally naded myself guys.

1950
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:46,650
I...

1951
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:51,470
I might have naded myself there.

1952
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:51,970
That's...

1953
01:24:51,970 --> 01:24:52,630
That's on me.

1954
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:54,250
That's on me guys.

1955
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:55,830
That's...

1956
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:56,330
Yeah.

1957
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:57,370
I deserve that.

1958
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:03,590
I noticed that I naded myself and I knew it was over.

1959
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:09,690
Are you not following me?

1960
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:11,250
Okay.

1961
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:11,670
They are.

1962
01:25:11,850 --> 01:25:12,150
Okay.

1963
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:12,650
That's good.

1964
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:14,450
Are you...

1965
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:15,450
Come over here guys!

1966
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:15,970
Men!

1967
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:17,910
Come over here!

1968
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:20,210
Men!

1969
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:21,210
I parked my car!

1970
01:25:22,530 --> 01:25:23,350
Right here men!

1971
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:25,590
Oh my god.

1972
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:25,890
Please.

1973
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:27,130
I parked my car.

1974
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:28,010
Come...

1975
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:28,910
Get over here!

1976
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:30,730
I parked my car right here!

1977
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:37,040
Please!

1978
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:38,200
Please!

1979
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:43,580
I'm right here!

1980
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:44,800
Get over here!

1981
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,660
Oh my god.

1982
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:55,460
Oh my god.

1983
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:56,600
How did...

1984
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:57,820
Oh my god.

1985
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,580
Do I need to clear the area first?

1986
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:02,140
And then you'll be happy?

1987
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:06,420
Okay.

1988
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,720
God they're so fucking stupid.

1989
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,000
They're so dead.

1990
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,860
They're not gonna live guys.

1991
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:15,460
They're so stupid.

1992
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:20,780
Alright.

1993
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:21,780
We gotta go this way.

1994
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,140
Alright.

1995
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:26,240
I'm gonna take you to war.

1996
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,520
I'm gonna take you to war.

1997
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:37,580
You're gonna get your stripes today!

1998
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,820
You're gonna get your stars today men!

1999
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:46,990
Oh what?

2000
01:26:49,990 --> 01:26:50,770
Yeah.

2001
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:53,270
No shit!

2002
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:54,290
Welcome to war!

2003
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:57,050
See?

2004
01:26:57,310 --> 01:26:58,630
They're not so tough.

2005
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:00,050
Oh yeah!

2006
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:03,630
Where's the others?

2007
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:05,310
Oh they're over here.

2008
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:07,070
Stick together!

2009
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:09,010
Oh my god.

2010
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:10,090
That guy is so brave.

2011
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:14,710
Okay.

2012
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:15,430
That's a grunt.

2013
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:17,390
There's no way you'd die to a grunt guys.

2014
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:20,290
What the hell am I doing here?

2015
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:23,310
What the hell am I doing here?

2016
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:24,590
Alright.

2017
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:27,930
Welcome to war!

2018
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:28,830
Cadets!

2019
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:33,090
There's like one below me somewhere.

2020
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:37,410
He's like running around like a little baby.

2021
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:40,170
Oh there he is.

2022
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:41,110
He was inside.

2023
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:43,730
There we go.

2024
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:45,750
That should be the last one right?

2025
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:46,890
That's the last of them.

2026
01:27:46,930 --> 01:27:47,170
Yeah.

2027
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:48,150
Roger that.

2028
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:49,170
I'm on my way.

2029
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:50,630
I did it.

2030
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:51,490
I'm a hero.

2031
01:27:52,450 --> 01:27:54,150
I found Captain Keyes.

2032
01:27:54,150 --> 01:27:56,390
He's being held on a Covenant cruiser.

2033
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:58,270
The Truth and Reconciliation.

2034
01:27:58,570 --> 01:27:59,070
The Truth and Reconciliation.

2035
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:00,910
A ship I disabled before we abandon the auto.

2036
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,270
I did it.

2037
01:28:03,290 --> 01:28:04,370
The Truth and Reconciliation.

2038
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:06,030
Touchdown on a desert plateau.

2039
01:28:06,230 --> 01:28:07,910
Roughly 300 kilometers up spin.

2040
01:28:10,390 --> 01:28:10,910
Hey.

2041
01:28:11,170 --> 01:28:12,130
This is where I parked my car.

2042
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:14,610
Alright.

2043
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:15,310
I saved them.

2044
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:19,830
Alright man.

2045
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:22,750
Come over here and escape.

2046
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:27,870
I worked very hard to secure your safety.

2047
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:29,630
Get aboard and let's get out of here.

2048
01:28:31,090 --> 01:28:31,610
Oh.

2049
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:33,070
Oh.

2050
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:33,790
I get to leave?

2051
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:34,870
Oh.

2052
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:35,110
Yay.

2053
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:35,570
Yippee.

2054
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:36,690
Bye.

2055
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:53,310
Yay.

2056
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:54,190
I did it.

2057
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:54,950
Mission complete.

2058
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:56,590
I saved everybody.

2059
01:28:58,130 --> 01:28:58,650
Everyone.

2060
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:00,130
Yippee.

2061
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:01,390
They all live.

2062
01:29:01,850 --> 01:29:02,510
Captain Keyes.

2063
01:29:02,650 --> 01:29:04,310
And are holding him aboard one of their cruisers.

2064
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:04,590
Okay.

2065
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:06,390
So I have to save Captain Keyes.

2066
01:29:06,530 --> 01:29:08,030
The ship is currently holding position.

2067
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:12,640
Okay.

2068
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:13,340
That's easy.

2069
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:16,040
There was always four.

2070
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,120
Heh heh heh heh.

2071
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:22,500
There's a gravity lift that varies troops and supplies between the ship and the surface.

2072
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:23,820
That's our ticket in.

2073
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:29,580
Once we get inside the ship, I should be able to lock onto the tracking signal from Captain Keyes neural implants.

2074
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:30,020
Okay.

2075
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,720
I have to rescue Captain Keyes.

2076
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:33,280
Wait.

2077
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:35,220
Sergeant Johnson lived!

2078
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:36,760
See I told you guys!

2079
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,020
He was just taking a nap!

2080
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:41,460
I told you!

2081
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:43,800
He was just napping!

2082
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:47,800
I recommend using your sniper rifle to take out the gunners while I call the marine support.

2083
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:48,760
Whoops.

2084
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:50,560
Ha ha ha.

2085
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:51,860
Oops.

2086
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:52,920
Ha ha ha.

2087
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:53,700
Oops.

2088
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:54,080
Ha ha ha ha.

2089
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:55,540
Don't let him get away!

2090
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:56,460
I didn't.

2091
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:00,460
I may or may not have let him finish talk.

2092
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:05,060
May I should have finished hearing him talk first.

2093
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:06,600
Ha ha ha.

2094
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:07,640
Oh, whoops.

2095
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:13,740
Oh no.

2096
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:16,900
Okay.

2097
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:18,140
That was an accident.

2098
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:21,580
Ha ha ha.

2099
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:25,700
Wait.

2100
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:26,780
I don't get a pistol?

2101
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:31,880
I didn't know we were supposed to stop!

2102
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:42,560
There we go.

2103
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:48,170
Guys, I didn't know it was an accident!

2104
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:51,950
No!

2105
01:30:54,650 --> 01:30:54,970
No!

2106
01:30:55,690 --> 01:30:55,810
No!

2107
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:55,910
No!

2108
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:58,470
Okay, I think a lot of my men are dead.

2109
01:30:59,230 --> 01:31:00,250
Ha ha ha ha!

2110
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:02,850
I think...

2111
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:04,130
I think a lot...

2112
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:05,150
Oh my god, I can't see.

2113
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:07,070
I had to put it on remastered.

2114
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:09,390
Enemy!

2115
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,120
Yeah, the strat.

2116
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:16,560
If I can't see...

2117
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:17,640
All I do...

2118
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:19,780
Okay, if I can't see...

2119
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:20,120
All I...

2120
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:20,300
Wait.

2121
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,080
I need to grab the lead pistol.

2122
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:26,860
What are the leads that killed?

2123
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:27,760
Here it is.

2124
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,220
Or if I can't see...

2125
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:31,600
Bam!

2126
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:33,380
That's right!

2127
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:35,060
I can see now.

2128
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:47,220
There we go.

2129
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:53,440
It's called the... the remaster strat.

2130
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:59,920
Yeah, I could use a flashlight, but like... I could also do... BAM!

2131
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:04,260
Oh, shit!

2132
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,500
Meat shields!

2133
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:11,400
Wait, where's Sergeant Johnson?

2134
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,780
Guys, we're Sergeant...

2135
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:18,180
Guys, we're Sergeant Johnson, guys!

2136
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,080
Oh, wait, he's still alive?

2137
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:31,430
Oh, shit!

2138
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:36,070
Oh, my god.

2139
01:32:36,230 --> 01:32:36,810
Oh, I shoved.

2140
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:37,490
Oh, my god.

2141
01:32:37,790 --> 01:32:38,290
That was my bad.

2142
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:43,310
Yeah, hombre!

2143
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:51,420
Oh, my god, these little stupid little babies!

2144
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,300
Oh, I need more ammo!

2145
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:00,500
You better be fucking sorry!

2146
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:01,720
Ow!

2147
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:02,300
What the

2148
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:08,860
fuck?!

2149
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:10,780
Who the fuck shot me?!

2150
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:11,520
I'm with you!

2151
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:15,690
I don't have ammo.

2152
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:18,730
Okay.

2153
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:20,890
Guys, sneak up around!

2154
01:33:21,110 --> 01:33:22,830
Guys, sneak up around!

2155
01:33:27,390 --> 01:33:28,550
Hey, good one!

2156
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:30,710
Okay.

2157
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:32,450
What

2158
01:33:38,810 --> 01:33:39,330
happened?!

2159
01:33:39,330 --> 01:33:40,190
A sneak up on...

2160
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:41,330
Okay, that's not on me!

2161
01:33:41,730 --> 01:33:43,610
That was not on me, guys!

2162
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:51,940
Okay, I hear it.

2163
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:53,800
There we go.

2164
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:01,480
Oh, no!

2165
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:07,840
I need to kill another Lee and steal his pistol!

2166
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:11,560
Oh, shit!

2167
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:12,760
I didn't think they're all there!

2168
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:13,680
I didn't think they're all there!

2169
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:14,200
Woo!

2170
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:19,400
Woooo!

2171
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:19,880
Woooo!

2172
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:20,440
Woooo!

2173
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:20,700
Woooo!

2174
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:22,980
No!

2175
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:23,880
No!

2176
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:28,360
It's okay, we can do this again, guys.

2177
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:31,260
Remember, we gotta sneak in, guys.

2178
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:34,520
Guys, we gotta sneak in, everybody.

2179
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:35,740
Covering fire!

2180
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:37,780
I- why did you shoot?

2181
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:39,520
God, I can't see.

2182
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:41,040
It's remastered time.

2183
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,220
Okay, that was pretty sick, though.

2184
01:34:57,410 --> 01:34:57,890
Okay,

2185
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:12,630
I don't think they saw me.

2186
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:27,660
There we go.

2187
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:28,760
I think I killed him.

2188
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:30,300
Peekaboo!

2189
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:32,820
Peekaboo!

2190
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:35,060
Okay, I think they're dead.

2191
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:37,600
Can I crouch jump that?

2192
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:38,340
Wait, can I?

2193
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:39,020
Let's try.

2194
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:40,940
No.

2195
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:43,040
I can't do crouch jump for that.

2196
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:45,340
No, I did!

2197
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:47,080
I did crouch jump!

2198
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:50,220
See?

2199
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,860
It doesn't let me crouch jump this!

2200
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:55,860
I- I know my crouch jumps!

2201
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:57,300
I'm playing TTT!

2202
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:19,290
Oh my god, there's a tree right here.

2203
01:36:20,050 --> 01:36:20,710
Did I kill him?

2204
01:36:20,770 --> 01:36:21,510
I can't tell.

2205
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:27,580
Okay, there we go.

2206
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:30,260
How are they getting shot at?

2207
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:32,020
Guys, what's going on?

2208
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:37,860
What the fuck is going on over there?

2209
01:36:42,450 --> 01:36:44,270
What the fuck are you doing over there?

2210
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:48,900
Oh my god, okay.

2211
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:49,880
I didn't hit myself.

2212
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:50,280
That's good.

2213
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:57,240
Oh my god, that stupid shield.

2214
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:04,220
Okay, my team's dead.

2215
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,740
I don't know what the fuck my team was doing, but they're dead.

2216
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:21,120
Where's the rest of them?

2217
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:21,940
Where's the rest of them?

2218
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:22,560
Oh wait, they're not dead!

2219
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:23,580
They're not dead, guys!

2220
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:24,160
You're live!

2221
01:37:29,530 --> 01:37:30,090
Where are you?

2222
01:37:30,210 --> 01:37:30,970
Yeah, they're dead.

2223
01:37:32,290 --> 01:37:33,470
Look at that, we did it.

2224
01:37:34,230 --> 01:37:35,490
We did it, everybody!

2225
01:37:35,870 --> 01:37:37,770
They rushed a B.

2226
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:44,020
Oh my god, that's fine.

2227
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:48,060
That's fine.

2228
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:48,420
That's fine.

2229
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:51,640
Alright, I need a fucking fine elite gun.

2230
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,040
I need a swap guns.

2231
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:56,180
Where are the elites?

2232
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:59,160
I know I killed some elites here!

2233
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:02,800
Where are they?

2234
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:07,120
Look, I was desperate, okay?

2235
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:07,760
I...

2236
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:11,640
Get over here.

2237
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:12,820
Get over here.

2238
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:16,780
They're mad that I used my regular gun.

2239
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:19,200
Oh my god, thank god!

2240
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:19,900
Finally!

2241
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:23,140
Okay, we have a real gun now.

2242
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:25,500
I have active camouflage.

2243
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:28,360
Oh nice.

2244
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:33,020
Okay, now I have ammo.

2245
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:36,340
I did it.

2246
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:37,140
Didn't clear everybody?

2247
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:38,360
No, there's people here.

2248
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,200
Where are they?

2249
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:42,280
Oh my god, there they are.

2250
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:45,640
Oh shit!

2251
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:50,820
Okay, I didn't realize all of them were gonna show up there.

2252
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:53,580
Get outta here!

2253
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:55,220
Oh no, sorry!

2254
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:55,820
Sorry!

2255
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:57,000
I can't!

2256
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:57,700
He's in us!

2257
01:38:58,220 --> 01:38:59,340
He's in the team!

2258
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:02,540
I've had enough of this crap!

2259
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:03,380
What are you thinking?

2260
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:04,400
What do you mean?

2261
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:05,500
I just shot my gun!

2262
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,120
We're directly under the ship now.

2263
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:10,340
Okay, I want...

2264
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:11,920
Where the fuck is the elite gun?

2265
01:39:27,770 --> 01:39:28,150
Eh?

2266
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:31,370
Is that all of them?

2267
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:33,710
Any elites?

2268
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:36,430
Okay, there's one.

2269
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:41,250
All right, get out of here.

2270
01:39:41,630 --> 01:39:42,350
Let's do it!

2271
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:45,850
All right, get out.

2272
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:48,010
Oh, it's a time thing!

2273
01:39:48,350 --> 01:39:48,530
Okay.

2274
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:51,690
Okay, I know that now.

2275
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:53,270
I know it's time now.

2276
01:39:53,390 --> 01:39:54,470
Because I was like so confused.

2277
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:00,100
Oh, is it homing?

2278
01:40:00,100 --> 01:40:00,840
Oh, it is!

2279
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:01,240
Nice!

2280
01:40:01,660 --> 01:40:02,560
I like that.

2281
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:12,780
Where is it?

2282
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:20,620
Okay, nice.

2283
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:22,380
Get outta here.

2284
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:23,880
Get outta here!

2285
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:25,700
Oh shit!

2286
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,140
Oh, I didn't realize there were more.

2287
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,120
That's okay.

2288
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:31,240
I have this.

2289
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:32,740
Oh fuck, nevermind!

2290
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:32,900
Oh god!

2291
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:35,860
Oh my god, the reload!

2292
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,240
Oh shit, I'm sorry!

2293
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,040
Got

2294
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:45,480
confused!

2295
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:48,000
Oh, I'm one HP.

2296
01:40:52,290 --> 01:40:54,590
I have to hit seven needles for it to explode?

2297
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:55,470
Okay, now I know.

2298
01:40:57,370 --> 01:40:58,430
I'll just spam it.

2299
01:41:02,230 --> 01:41:02,950
There we go.

2300
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:07,510
That's not overkill, right?

2301
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:13,070
Guys, it's not overkill, guys.

2302
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:14,310
They deserve that.

2303
01:41:16,010 --> 01:41:18,390
They absolutely deserve it.

2304
01:41:21,370 --> 01:41:22,270
Here we go.

2305
01:41:23,090 --> 01:41:24,630
Jesus, how many are there?

2306
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:29,780
Okay.

2307
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:31,180
I'm just gonna keep throwing.

2308
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:32,140
Nades.

2309
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:33,580
Here we go.

2310
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:37,340
That's fine.

2311
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:37,600
That's fine.

2312
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,040
I have this.

2313
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:39,500
I don't have this.

2314
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:46,080
I need a new gun.

2315
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:46,760
It's okay.

2316
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,540
I have this now.

2317
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:51,260
There we go.

2318
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:22,260
I'm so sad.

2319
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:25,180
I'm so sad.

2320
01:42:25,660 --> 01:42:26,200
I'm so sad.

2321
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:29,160
My own teammates naded me.

2322
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:31,980
I'm so sad.

2323
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:39,480
I'm so sad.

2324
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:46,950
I'm so sad.

2325
01:42:47,970 --> 01:42:48,690
Yeah.

2326
01:42:48,850 --> 01:42:50,770
Damn right, it's your fucking fault.

2327
01:42:56,650 --> 01:42:58,310
Damn fucking right.

2328
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:06,760
I can't believe he shot.

2329
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,660
I can't believe it.

2330
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:12,120
I can't believe it.

2331
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,440
Shot by my own teammates.

2332
01:43:19,150 --> 01:43:20,410
The marines.

2333
01:43:20,690 --> 01:43:21,150
No one.

2334
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:22,390
What did I do?

2335
01:43:22,970 --> 01:43:24,290
What did I do?

2336
01:43:26,510 --> 01:43:28,550
I don't know what they're talking about.

2337
01:43:28,770 --> 01:43:29,510
I did nothing.

2338
01:43:31,030 --> 01:43:32,750
I was a good soldier.

2339
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:35,910
A good soldier knows how to follow orders.

2340
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:41,600
I can't believe it.

2341
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:45,520
I can't, I can't believe they did that to me.

2342
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:50,360
I didn't deserve that.

2343
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:54,280
I didn't deserve that.

2344
01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:55,100
You do it.

2345
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:02,260
You do- There's only one.

2346
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:03,800
There's only one left.

2347
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:10,600
I've made sure let's... let's survive this time.

2348
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:12,720
I've made sure of that.

2349
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,020
Get out of here.

2350
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:21,200
Now it's just me.

2351
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:28,860
Now... now it's just me.

2352
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:30,900
As it should be.

2353
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:39,620
I'm fine with that.

2354
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:40,160
No!

2355
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:40,920
No!

2356
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:42,260
Get me out of here!

2357
01:44:42,620 --> 01:44:46,100
Get me out of here!

2358
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:50,740
Just do it.

2359
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:54,400
Stop shooting yourself!

2360
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:00,800
Alright, it's fine.

2361
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:03,200
We go up?

2362
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:04,720
I don't know if I should...

2363
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:06,380
Wait, what the fuck is that?

2364
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:07,960
Wait, what?

2365
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:10,480
Oh, I do not have enough ammo for that.

2366
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:14,760
Oh my god, what the fuck is that?

2367
01:45:18,430 --> 01:45:20,010
What the fuck is that?

2368
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:25,360
Holy shit!

2369
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:26,100
Okay, it's dead.

2370
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:31,340
Are these hunters?

2371
01:45:35,130 --> 01:45:36,590
Okay, now we can go up.

2372
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:41,050
Once we're inside the ship, I can home in on the captain's command...

2373
01:45:41,050 --> 01:45:42,730
Okay, we can get captain keys now.

2374
01:45:46,230 --> 01:45:47,470
Beam me up, Scott.

2375
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:58,440
No, I'm not heroic.

2376
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:09,220
Oh?

2377
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:11,220
Why is there no covenant?

2378
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:11,660
Yeah.

2379
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:13,140
Maybe nobody's home.

2380
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:15,540
But they sent...

2381
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:17,500
Did they send their entire family to kill me?

2382
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:19,500
Oh!

2383
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:20,440
They're invisible!

2384
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:24,420
Oh no, I have no nades.

2385
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,600
I have no nades.

2386
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:26,220
You have no covenant.

2387
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:27,860
You have to open your mouth.

2388
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:30,560
Oh my god, they're invisible now.

2389
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:32,780
Run!

2390
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:35,820
Oh my god, they have nades!

2391
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:37,900
Look at them fly!

2392
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:39,660
I see you.

2393
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:40,560
I see you.

2394
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:40,980
It's glowing.

2395
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:42,360
I see you.

2396
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:42,860
Oh!

2397
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:47,000
It's fine.

2398
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:47,400
It's fine.

2399
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:47,820
I'm okay.

2400
01:46:52,270 --> 01:46:53,350
Oh my god.

2401
01:46:53,530 --> 01:46:54,410
Oh my god.

2402
01:46:54,570 --> 01:46:54,730
No!

2403
01:46:55,130 --> 01:46:56,850
It's one shot!

2404
01:47:00,010 --> 01:47:01,670
It's one shot!

2405
01:47:05,230 --> 01:47:05,890
Okay.

2406
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:07,130
Oh my god.

2407
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:08,470
Wait, they're running blind!

2408
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,200
Oh my god.

2409
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:16,340
Oh my god.

2410
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:18,990
Oh my...

2411
01:47:18,990 --> 01:47:19,310
Please.

2412
01:47:19,690 --> 01:47:20,270
Give me your gun.

2413
01:47:20,510 --> 01:47:20,910
Give me...

2414
01:47:20,910 --> 01:47:20,990
No!

2415
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:22,690
I think...

2416
01:47:29,690 --> 01:47:31,030
He has to die!

2417
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:38,020
Why are they so much...

2418
01:47:38,020 --> 01:47:39,660
Oh my god, he just killed my men!

2419
01:47:59,530 --> 01:48:00,010
No!

2420
01:48:00,250 --> 01:48:01,110
Don't let him kill me!

2421
01:48:01,330 --> 01:48:01,670
Please!

2422
01:48:05,690 --> 01:48:06,170
Okay.

2423
01:48:06,570 --> 01:48:06,910
Okay.

2424
01:48:07,490 --> 01:48:07,970
Okay.

2425
01:48:08,630 --> 01:48:10,310
I just didn't have another gun.

2426
01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:13,030
I had to wait for my men to die before I could...

2427
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:14,630
Okay, thank god he died.

2428
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:15,550
Thank god.

2429
01:48:15,790 --> 01:48:15,950
Okay.

2430
01:48:16,510 --> 01:48:16,890
Thank god.

2431
01:48:17,310 --> 01:48:18,490
Thank fucking god.

2432
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:19,930
Oh my god.

2433
01:48:22,350 --> 01:48:23,050
Thank god.

2434
01:48:23,190 --> 01:48:23,470
It's okay.

2435
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:24,670
We needed him to die.

2436
01:48:26,150 --> 01:48:27,510
That's good that he died.

2437
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:28,750
We needed him to die.

2438
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:29,590
You don't understand.

2439
01:48:30,050 --> 01:48:31,750
We ran out of ammo.

2440
01:48:31,950 --> 01:48:33,270
We had to let him die.

2441
01:48:36,970 --> 01:48:37,750
Oh my god.

2442
01:48:37,870 --> 01:48:38,650
They are everywhere.

2443
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:40,270
They are.

2444
01:48:46,050 --> 01:48:46,550
Nice.

2445
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:46,870
Okay.

2446
01:48:46,990 --> 01:48:47,850
I have enough ammo now.

2447
01:48:48,110 --> 01:48:48,910
Back me up.

2448
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:51,750
Okay.

2449
01:48:51,870 --> 01:48:52,190
We're fine.

2450
01:48:52,330 --> 01:48:52,870
We're fine now.

2451
01:48:57,460 --> 01:48:58,680
No, you did not.

2452
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:00,200
No, you did not.

2453
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:02,880
You know you did not.

2454
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:06,960
I hear.

2455
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:07,820
I hear.

2456
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:09,820
I hear.

2457
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:15,110
I hear.

2458
01:49:15,110 --> 01:49:15,370
Oh my god.

2459
01:49:15,470 --> 01:49:15,710
It's okay.

2460
01:49:15,830 --> 01:49:16,890
If he dies, it's okay.

2461
01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:18,210
If he dies, it's okay.

2462
01:49:18,230 --> 01:49:19,070
We need more ammo.

2463
01:49:19,490 --> 01:49:20,730
We need all the ammo.

2464
01:49:24,430 --> 01:49:24,750
No.

2465
01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:25,850
No, no, no, no, no.

2466
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:32,330
Oh no.

2467
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:33,910
Okay.

2468
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:38,750
I hear.

2469
01:49:38,910 --> 01:49:39,630
I hear him.

2470
01:49:39,770 --> 01:49:40,410
I hear him.

2471
01:49:40,570 --> 01:49:41,070
But where?

2472
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:41,970
I hear him.

2473
01:49:42,070 --> 01:49:42,730
I hear him.

2474
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:43,430
I hear him.

2475
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:44,030
Go roar.

2476
01:49:45,210 --> 01:49:46,110
But where?

2477
01:50:01,090 --> 01:50:02,050
Behind me.

2478
01:50:02,410 --> 01:50:02,550
Okay.

2479
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:08,250
No, let me have the... No, I need him to die!

2480
01:50:12,180 --> 01:50:12,980
I got it!

2481
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:13,740
No!

2482
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:16,460
He has to kill my men.

2483
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:18,280
No!

2484
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:21,320
I need the gun!

2485
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:24,700
I'm almost softlocked.

2486
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:26,580
I'm almost softlocked.

2487
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:33,700
I need them to, like... I'm actually almost softlocked.

2488
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:42,660
No, I'm trying to find... Where is the gun?!

2489
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:44,480
I can't!

2490
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:46,140
Every time I use the gun!

2491
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:56,390
There we go, there we go, there we go, there we go!

2492
01:50:56,670 --> 01:50:57,450
We did it!

2493
01:50:57,890 --> 01:50:58,670
We did it!

2494
01:50:59,030 --> 01:51:00,210
We did it, guys!

2495
01:51:01,050 --> 01:51:02,030
We did it!

2496
01:51:03,630 --> 01:51:05,590
I tried to melee him!

2497
01:51:05,730 --> 01:51:08,390
He just... He does so much!

2498
01:51:09,930 --> 01:51:11,550
I swear to God!

2499
01:51:12,910 --> 01:51:15,370
Meleeing him was the first thing I did!

2500
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:27,920
We lived, we lived for so long, dude.

2501
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:29,040
That's the worst part.

2502
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:31,500
Oh, no!

2503
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:32,520
I have no HP!

2504
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,060
I gotta hear him!

2505
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:35,720
Fear!

2506
01:51:36,140 --> 01:51:37,060
Absolute fear!

2507
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:38,600
Absolute fear!

2508
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:39,440
I'm one HP!

2509
01:51:39,980 --> 01:51:40,180
No!

2510
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:40,220
No!

2511
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:45,440
Oh my god.

2512
01:51:58,560 --> 01:51:59,700
Why did it work?

2513
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:01,400
Why did it work?

2514
01:52:01,620 --> 01:52:03,200
Why did it work?

2515
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:06,640
Why did it work?

2516
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:11,420
WHY DID IT WOR-

2517
01:52:21,010 --> 01:52:27,290
Lise, please get me out of here!

2518
01:52:42,050 --> 01:52:45,010
Where's my teammate... what?!

2519
01:52:45,010 --> 01:52:46,210
Hot down to me!

2520
01:52:49,230 --> 01:52:51,250
Please get me out of here.

2521
01:52:51,730 --> 01:52:55,530
Lise, somebody get me out of here!

2522
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:04,300
No, no, no.

2523
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:06,760
No, no... Where's your dead body?!

2524
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:07,960
Where's your dead body?!

2525
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:08,800
Oh, thank God!

2526
01:53:08,940 --> 01:53:09,340
Ok, ok!

2527
01:53:09,460 --> 01:53:09,700
I'm okay!

2528
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:10,600
Now, I'm okay!

2529
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:10,800
Now!

2530
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:11,220
I'm okay!

2531
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:11,900
Ok.

2532
01:53:12,380 --> 01:53:12,520
Now!

2533
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:13,460
Oh, my God.

2534
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:19,500
It's fine!

2535
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:20,680
It's fine!

2536
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:25,260
Oh, my God, I found!

2537
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:26,500
I found!

2538
01:53:38,820 --> 01:53:39,280
Oh, my God.

2539
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:39,800
I'm not OK?

2540
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,500
Oh, my God, I'm not OK!

2541
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:46,440
Okay.

2542
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:50,240
Oh, I'm not okay.

2543
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:52,260
I am not okay, guys.

2544
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:55,460
I'm so scared.

2545
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:56,720
I'm so scared.

2546
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:01,820
Oh, please have mercy.

2547
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:08,920
Get out of here.

2548
01:54:09,580 --> 01:54:09,820
Get out.

2549
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:20,170
I had to reload!

2550
01:54:20,170 --> 01:54:20,650
Oh, my God!

2551
01:54:21,150 --> 01:54:21,950
Where's

2552
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:30,860
your gun?

2553
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:32,460
Where's your gun?

2554
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:33,860
Where's your gun?

2555
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:34,920
I see one.

2556
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:35,900
Contact!

2557
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:37,460
Lots of contact!

2558
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:39,040
Oh,

2559
01:54:43,810 --> 01:54:44,970
my God!

2560
01:54:45,430 --> 01:54:48,070
Why did I use it all?

2561
01:54:55,660 --> 01:54:56,460
Why?

2562
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:58,780
Oh, I'm one.

2563
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,300
I'm one.

2564
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:01,660
I'm okay.

2565
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,280
It's you and me.

2566
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:12,960
Okay.

2567
01:55:24,430 --> 01:55:25,590
I'll stay here.

2568
01:55:25,950 --> 01:55:27,390
Oh, I can't stay here.

2569
01:55:27,930 --> 01:55:28,870
Imagine if... No!

2570
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:29,490
No!

2571
01:55:43,460 --> 01:55:44,020
Oh,

2572
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:51,560
I think he sees me.

2573
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:53,520
I think he sees me.

2574
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:55,160
I think he saw me.

2575
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:03,380
I'm fucking stuck in a loop.

2576
01:56:03,700 --> 01:56:05,400
Let me out of here!

2577
01:56:14,570 --> 01:56:15,390
Where is it?

2578
01:56:17,290 --> 01:56:18,050
Here we go.

2579
01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:18,510
Here we go.

2580
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:18,950
We got it.

2581
01:56:20,050 --> 01:56:20,570
We got it.

2582
01:56:21,970 --> 01:56:22,750
Nice one.

2583
01:56:23,050 --> 01:56:23,530
Nice one.

2584
01:56:23,530 --> 01:56:23,570
Okay.

2585
01:56:25,450 --> 01:56:26,130
We're okay.

2586
01:56:27,770 --> 01:56:28,250
We're okay.

2587
01:56:28,250 --> 01:56:29,070
We're okay for now.

2588
01:56:34,630 --> 01:56:35,470
We're okay for now.

2589
01:56:37,110 --> 01:56:37,530
Wait.

2590
01:56:37,630 --> 01:56:37,970
I hear him.

2591
01:56:38,090 --> 01:56:38,730
I hear him.

2592
01:56:38,830 --> 01:56:39,510
I hear him.

2593
01:56:39,650 --> 01:56:40,390
I hear him.

2594
01:56:43,150 --> 01:56:53,650
I hear

2595
01:56:56,840 --> 01:56:56,840
him.

2596
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:58,660
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

2597
01:56:58,740 --> 01:56:59,080
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

2598
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:00,300
OHHH, it's okay!

2599
01:57:00,580 --> 01:57:01,400
Oh my god, I'm sorry!

2600
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:02,260
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

2601
01:57:04,780 --> 01:57:05,840
I was panicking!

2602
01:57:19,220 --> 01:57:20,120
I'm also scared.

2603
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:21,100
Don't worry, buddy.

2604
01:57:21,260 --> 01:57:22,020
I'm also scared.

2605
01:57:25,780 --> 01:57:26,480
Oh my god.

2606
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:30,980
Oh my god!

2607
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:32,020
That's right!

2608
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:50,100
Oh my god.

2609
01:57:57,710 --> 01:57:58,370
I'm scared.

2610
01:57:59,690 --> 01:58:00,510
I'm so scared.

2611
01:58:01,290 --> 01:58:02,470
Oh, I have no ammo.

2612
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:08,360
Okay.

2613
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:10,480
I'll be over here.

2614
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:13,820
That should do something, right?

2615
01:58:14,860 --> 01:58:16,560
No, no, no, no, no.

2616
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:19,580
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2617
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:22,660
Okay, it's fine.

2618
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:24,920
We're so healthy.

2619
01:58:30,450 --> 01:58:31,830
Alright, I'll just stay here.

2620
01:58:34,270 --> 01:58:34,970
It's fine.

2621
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:38,050
Oh my God, I have no ammo.

2622
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:39,170
It's not fine.

2623
01:58:39,350 --> 01:58:40,330
It's not fine.

2624
01:58:40,570 --> 01:58:42,870
I ran out of ammo for all my guns.

2625
01:58:44,290 --> 01:58:44,950
It's fine.

2626
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:49,820
Okay.

2627
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:53,280
No, fuck it.

2628
01:58:53,420 --> 01:58:54,300
You guys deserve this.

2629
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:58,500
Please, I just, please, I just want to be out of this hell.

2630
01:58:58,760 --> 01:58:59,120
Please.

2631
01:58:59,420 --> 01:59:01,600
I don't want to be here anymore.

2632
01:59:02,900 --> 01:59:04,620
Get me out of here!

2633
01:59:05,660 --> 01:59:06,700
Oh, no!

2634
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:09,720
Alright.

2635
01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:15,140
Okay.

2636
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:17,220
Are we... Is it over?

2637
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:20,640
Is it over?

2638
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:24,420
Is it over?

2639
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:27,920
Is it over?

2640
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:31,460
Oh my God, I hear you.

2641
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:33,240
Oh my God, no ammo.

2642
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:49,380
Oh my God, no ammo.

2643
01:59:50,000 --> 02:00:00,900
Oh my God, no ammo.

2644
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:00,900
Oh my God, no ammo.

2645
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:05,160
What do you mean?

2646
02:00:05,660 --> 02:00:06,700
What do you mean?

2647
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:07,420
What do you mean?

2648
02:00:07,420 --> 02:00:07,720
What do you mean?

2649
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:07,920
What do you mean?

2650
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:08,140
What do you mean?

2651
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:08,860
What do you mean?

2652
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:16,840
I don't think he knows.

2653
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:17,600
What do you mean?

2654
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:17,600
What do you mean?

2655
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:17,600
What do you mean?

2656
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:17,600
What do you mean?

2657
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:17,600
What do you mean?

2658
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:17,600
What do you mean?

2659
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:17,600
What do you mean?

2660
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:17,600
What do you mean?

2661
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:17,600
What do you mean?

2662
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:17,600
What do you mean?

2663
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:17,600
What do you mean?

2664
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:17,600
What do you mean?

2665
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:17,600
What do you mean?

2666
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:18,380
I don't think he knows.

2667
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:18,460
I don't think he knows.

2668
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:19,520
I don't think he knows.

2669
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:19,880
I don't think he knows.

2670
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:20,280
I don't think he knows.

2671
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:20,680
I don't think he knows.

2672
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:20,680
I don't think he knows.

2673
02:00:20,860 --> 02:00:20,940
I don't think he knows.

2674
02:00:20,940 --> 02:00:21,200
I don't think he knows.

2675
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:21,460
I don't think he knows.

2676
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:21,460
I don't think he knows.

2677
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:21,700
I don't think he knows.

2678
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:21,700
I don't think he knows.

2679
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:22,120
I don't think he knows.

2680
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:28,860
I don't think he knows.

2681
02:00:37,030 --> 02:00:37,390
I don No!

2682
02:00:40,310 --> 02:00:41,250
It's fine.

2683
02:00:45,420 --> 02:00:47,140
Oh my god, it's so fine.

2684
02:00:47,320 --> 02:00:48,840
Oh my god, it's so fine.

2685
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:53,100
We... are we okay?

2686
02:00:53,820 --> 02:00:54,360
Hello?

2687
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:56,680
Hello?

2688
02:00:57,920 --> 02:00:58,340
Oh!

2689
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:00,580
Is everybody dead?

2690
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:03,260
Oh my god!

2691
02:01:03,660 --> 02:01:04,900
We made it!

2692
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:06,820
We fucking made it!

2693
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:08,780
Oh my god!

2694
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:21,300
We didn't find a fire!

2695
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:25,060
You can tap fire in a... Which one is the plasma?

2696
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:27,940
I've lost track of everything.

2697
02:01:33,820 --> 02:01:35,260
There's a help back!

2698
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:37,140
Oh my god, where is it?

2699
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:39,640
Oh, okay.

2700
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:40,860
Okay, gotta explore.

2701
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:42,300
Gotta calm down.

2702
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:44,720
Okay.

2703
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:45,940
Oh, okay.

2704
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:46,440
That's good.

2705
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:47,520
I'll use that.

2706
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:52,840
Oh my god, there's a... Oh my god, there's a help back.

2707
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:53,780
Thank god.

2708
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:56,120
Okay, everything is okay.

2709
02:01:56,620 --> 02:01:58,040
Everything is okay now.

2710
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:02,040
No, that sniper is the one I threw away, I'm pretty sure.

2711
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:05,080
Yeah, that was the one I threw away.

2712
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:08,640
Oh...

2713
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:10,220
Okay, we did it.

2714
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:11,660
We made it.

2715
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:14,600
We made it through the next room.

2716
02:02:17,540 --> 02:02:17,940
Um...

2717
02:02:17,940 --> 02:02:18,420
Okay.

2718
02:02:22,710 --> 02:02:23,890
God, I need this.

2719
02:02:28,050 --> 02:02:28,710
Oh my god!

2720
02:02:31,290 --> 02:02:32,670
I don't think they know I'm here.

2721
02:02:40,730 --> 02:02:41,910
Okay, I don't think they know.

2722
02:02:43,790 --> 02:02:44,290
Nice.

2723
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:49,420
Okay, this way.

2724
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:58,400
Okay, I'm gonna make sure I nade all of this so he doesn't fucking bother me.

2725
02:02:58,760 --> 02:02:58,860
Alright.

2726
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:00,860
One more.

2727
02:03:06,150 --> 02:03:07,290
Wait, who's below me?

2728
02:03:08,970 --> 02:03:09,650
What the fuck?

2729
02:03:09,770 --> 02:03:10,310
I can't see.

2730
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:11,950
Don't worry.

2731
02:03:12,230 --> 02:03:13,230
I can see now.

2732
02:03:16,870 --> 02:03:18,050
My shields!

2733
02:03:20,710 --> 02:03:21,470
That's fine.

2734
02:03:22,210 --> 02:03:23,770
I'm going with recharge shields.

2735
02:03:27,110 --> 02:03:28,930
He was tearing it back.

2736
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:30,830
Guys, I couldn't see!

2737
02:03:35,660 --> 02:03:36,260
Okay.

2738
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:43,400
Oh my god, they have so much HP!

2739
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:45,500
Like

2740
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:50,160
that!

2741
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:51,020
That's fucking right!

2742
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:53,960
That's right, you should have moved!

2743
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:55,460
That's what you get!

2744
02:04:01,150 --> 02:04:02,790
Oh, I thought there was somebody to my left.

2745
02:04:04,210 --> 02:04:04,570
Okay.

2746
02:04:06,170 --> 02:04:07,610
Oh my god, no, not my shields.

2747
02:04:07,910 --> 02:04:08,870
Okay, they do like...

2748
02:04:08,870 --> 02:04:11,050
They do like P damage on me, so it's fine.

2749
02:04:15,100 --> 02:04:16,780
It's these guys I have to worry about.

2750
02:04:17,100 --> 02:04:18,300
They do like two pick damage.

2751
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:21,940
That's it.

2752
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:23,460
I'm getting these guys out.

2753
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:25,780
Okay, I shouldn't peek though.

2754
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:26,460
I just realized...

2755
02:04:27,580 --> 02:04:29,220
I need to wait for my shield recharge.

2756
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:31,940
Okay, nice.

2757
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:32,540
Now I can look.

2758
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:33,180
No!

2759
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:34,580
My fucking battery!

2760
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:36,840
Okay.

2761
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:45,760
Alright, I don't need to kill them.

2762
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:46,880
Never mind, I'm gonna leave.

2763
02:04:48,700 --> 02:04:50,060
Fuck this, I'm leaving.

2764
02:04:52,060 --> 02:04:54,960
I realized I didn't have to kill them anyway.

2765
02:04:55,640 --> 02:04:56,540
There's no point.

2766
02:04:57,460 --> 02:04:58,340
You know what?

2767
02:04:58,440 --> 02:04:58,760
Fuck this.

2768
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:04,360
Alright.

2769
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:07,540
Hurry up.

2770
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:13,180
Guys, why did I use all my sniper rifle?

2771
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:14,580
Why?

2772
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:18,120
Why did nobody warn me?

2773
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:30,560
No way!

2774
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:31,900
He dodged it?

2775
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:33,120
No way!

2776
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:36,560
That's fucking right.

2777
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:38,620
Okay, I like this gun.

2778
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:40,240
And this was my favorite gun.

2779
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:41,780
From the aliens.

2780
02:05:45,430 --> 02:05:45,990
Okay.

2781
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:57,240
I know, like, I know I should just shoot it when you're not using the shield, but, like, I can't be bothered, guys.

2782
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:01,540
I actually can't be bothered.

2783
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:03,260
Fuck this.

2784
02:06:12,180 --> 02:06:12,740
Alright.

2785
02:06:16,060 --> 02:06:16,980
Are we good?

2786
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:18,600
Are we safe now?

2787
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:21,120
I don't detect any...

2788
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:23,060
I detect motion.

2789
02:06:27,270 --> 02:06:27,710
Alright.

2790
02:06:27,890 --> 02:06:28,490
Oh, wait!

2791
02:06:28,610 --> 02:06:29,410
Oh, you're still alive!

2792
02:06:29,650 --> 02:06:30,470
That's just your shield!

2793
02:06:31,210 --> 02:06:32,390
Oh my god, I see the grenade.

2794
02:06:32,670 --> 02:06:33,850
I see the grenade, guys.

2795
02:06:34,190 --> 02:06:35,590
How do you get baited this time?

2796
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:42,160
Where you going, little buddy?

2797
02:06:43,180 --> 02:06:44,200
That's fucking right.

2798
02:06:45,220 --> 02:06:47,220
You think you can... you can run away?

2799
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:50,280
I wanted to run away, and look what that got me.

2800
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:51,920
Now I'm in a fucking war!

2801
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:56,340
Oh, shit.

2802
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:58,060
Oh, shit!

2803
02:06:58,220 --> 02:07:00,120
Oh, sh- What!

2804
02:07:09,070 --> 02:07:11,550
He's sticky-boreed me like a whore!

2805
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:19,220
I can't do anything about it!

2806
02:07:25,910 --> 02:07:27,150
That's messed up.

2807
02:07:29,650 --> 02:07:32,090
The fact that I can't do anything about it.

2808
02:07:32,950 --> 02:07:34,670
I just gotta live with it.

2809
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:39,480
I see you.

2810
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:41,120
I fucking see you.

2811
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:44,320
I see you!

2812
02:07:47,580 --> 02:07:48,140
Okay.

2813
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:53,140
It's fine.

2814
02:07:53,700 --> 02:07:54,280
Oh, no.

2815
02:07:54,540 --> 02:07:54,880
Oh, no.

2816
02:07:55,480 --> 02:07:56,000
That's right.

2817
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:56,600
I saw you.

2818
02:07:56,720 --> 02:07:58,780
I saw you behind me.

2819
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:01,220
That's fucking right.

2820
02:08:03,160 --> 02:08:03,640
Oh.

2821
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:04,840
What?

2822
02:08:04,980 --> 02:08:05,860
Oh, there you are.

2823
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:06,780
What the fuck?

2824
02:08:06,820 --> 02:08:07,880
It didn't show up in my movement.

2825
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:11,060
I only have 16 bullets, guys.

2826
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:13,700
Okay, never mind.

2827
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:14,800
I have 88 now.

2828
02:08:15,780 --> 02:08:16,160
All right.

2829
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:18,320
Oh, there's more.

2830
02:08:18,900 --> 02:08:20,260
Okay, it's just the babies, though.

2831
02:08:20,860 --> 02:08:22,080
I'm not as scared.

2832
02:08:22,940 --> 02:08:24,080
It's just the babies.

2833
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:32,680
Get out of here.

2834
02:08:32,680 --> 02:08:34,880
Get out of here.

2835
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:35,900
Get out.

2836
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:39,680
Mommy's trying to play a game.

2837
02:08:47,570 --> 02:08:48,570
Okay, this way.

2838
02:08:55,290 --> 02:08:55,810
Alright.

2839
02:08:58,590 --> 02:08:59,270
That's good.

2840
02:08:59,410 --> 02:08:59,650
That's good.

2841
02:08:59,690 --> 02:09:00,650
He's not using his shield.

2842
02:09:01,010 --> 02:09:03,610
The one defense he has, he's not using it.

2843
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:08,720
Get out of here.

2844
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:09,860
That's right.

2845
02:09:09,940 --> 02:09:11,240
You think I'm gonna take cover?

2846
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:12,440
Oh shit, I'll take cover.

2847
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:13,080
Oh wait, never mind.

2848
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:13,880
Never mind.

2849
02:09:14,100 --> 02:09:15,080
You're right, I will.

2850
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:17,220
I just noticed who it was.

2851
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:20,860
I thought that was like, not, not the elites.

2852
02:09:23,220 --> 02:09:23,840
Word, word, word.

2853
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:27,060
Word, word, word.

2854
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:31,800
You have?

2855
02:09:32,060 --> 02:09:32,500
Okay.

2856
02:09:33,140 --> 02:09:33,900
I need new ammo.

2857
02:09:35,240 --> 02:09:36,400
Get out of here.

2858
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:41,440
Oh my god.

2859
02:09:41,720 --> 02:09:43,880
I'm so scared of the hunters, guys.

2860
02:09:46,860 --> 02:09:47,480
Please.

2861
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:49,120
Oh, thank god.

2862
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:52,760
Oh, thank god.

2863
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:54,420
Reinforcements.

2864
02:09:57,120 --> 02:09:58,020
Oh shit.

2865
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:04,500
Where's the reinforcements?

2866
02:10:11,120 --> 02:10:12,880
I was told reinforcements.

2867
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:13,500
Where are they?

2868
02:10:20,070 --> 02:10:20,950
Oh my god.

2869
02:10:22,690 --> 02:10:23,070
Okay, nice.

2870
02:10:23,290 --> 02:10:24,730
Stand in front of the bullets.

2871
02:10:25,350 --> 02:10:25,530
Yes.

2872
02:10:26,510 --> 02:10:28,010
Reinforcements stand in front of it.

2873
02:10:30,450 --> 02:10:31,130
Yes.

2874
02:10:31,350 --> 02:10:32,170
Take it all.

2875
02:10:33,370 --> 02:10:34,850
Take it all.

2876
02:10:35,450 --> 02:10:36,130
Take it all.

2877
02:10:36,750 --> 02:10:37,830
Thank god.

2878
02:10:38,590 --> 02:10:40,170
Thank god for reinforcements.

2879
02:10:44,330 --> 02:10:46,690
How do I like, get above, though?

2880
02:10:48,830 --> 02:10:50,810
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

2881
02:10:50,870 --> 02:10:52,990
Wait, I think my art, my team's dying.

2882
02:10:58,520 --> 02:10:59,080
That's fine.

2883
02:10:59,200 --> 02:10:59,600
That's okay.

2884
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:03,540
My reen- oh, my entire reinforcements are dead, guys.

2885
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:07,720
Guys.

2886
02:11:07,720 --> 02:11:08,840
Guys, they're all dead.

2887
02:11:09,880 --> 02:11:10,000
Um.

2888
02:11:11,700 --> 02:11:12,080
Guys.

2889
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:13,600
I don't know what happened.

2890
02:11:14,220 --> 02:11:15,940
They all just died.

2891
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:21,920
What the fuck happened?

2892
02:11:24,180 --> 02:11:25,520
They're all dead.

2893
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:27,800
What happened?

2894
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:31,320
What happened?

2895
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:33,860
It sounded so epic.

2896
02:11:40,690 --> 02:11:42,590
It sounded so epic.

2897
02:11:43,310 --> 02:11:45,830
The music was so epic.

2898
02:11:47,750 --> 02:11:49,530
How do I get up?

2899
02:11:51,970 --> 02:11:54,430
You just walked away.

2900
02:11:56,630 --> 02:11:59,370
I don't know, I thought they- Okay, I need to restart this.

2901
02:11:59,470 --> 02:11:59,970
Kill me now.

2902
02:12:00,650 --> 02:12:01,790
I already lost all my shield.

2903
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:02,690
It's not worth it.

2904
02:12:03,190 --> 02:12:03,890
It's not.

2905
02:12:07,530 --> 02:12:11,210
Yeah, how could they die after such an epic music?

2906
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:13,370
Requesting reinforcements at our position.

2907
02:12:13,970 --> 02:12:15,250
I don't understand.

2908
02:12:23,740 --> 02:12:24,220
Okay.

2909
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:28,780
I have to reset my shields.

2910
02:12:29,460 --> 02:12:30,140
Right here.

2911
02:12:34,110 --> 02:12:34,590
Okay.

2912
02:12:37,630 --> 02:12:39,590
I don't know how they just died.

2913
02:12:40,390 --> 02:12:43,530
They don't get- I thought they would get the music buff.

2914
02:12:43,870 --> 02:12:46,050
It sounded so cool and everything.

2915
02:12:48,310 --> 02:12:50,090
And then they were just dead.

2916
02:12:50,690 --> 02:12:52,450
I don't know what happened to them.

2917
02:12:56,350 --> 02:12:58,450
It was so cool.

2918
02:13:00,690 --> 02:13:01,450
I don't know what happened to them.

2919
02:13:02,170 --> 02:13:02,730
Oh no.

2920
02:13:04,630 --> 02:13:05,810
Oh no, I need to grab this.

2921
02:13:08,730 --> 02:13:09,330
Here we go.

2922
02:13:11,630 --> 02:13:12,770
Where are they getting shot from?

2923
02:13:13,170 --> 02:13:15,090
Oh my god, that's where they're getting shot from.

2924
02:13:21,590 --> 02:13:21,950
Okay.

2925
02:13:22,550 --> 02:13:23,410
Oh no, no battery.

2926
02:13:23,410 --> 02:13:24,990
That burns!

2927
02:13:26,930 --> 02:13:28,830
I'm trying my best!

2928
02:13:30,470 --> 02:13:32,410
They have high ground!

2929
02:13:44,810 --> 02:13:45,690
Okay.

2930
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:52,560
I'm trying, I'm trying to find an energy gun!

2931
02:13:55,340 --> 02:13:56,660
But there are none!

2932
02:13:57,160 --> 02:13:58,000
Probably burn!

2933
02:14:02,450 --> 02:14:04,190
They just- He's just rolling!

2934
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:05,710
I'm trying to nade him!

2935
02:14:05,830 --> 02:14:07,130
And all they do is roll!

2936
02:14:09,710 --> 02:14:12,150
Oh my god, you can't use the cover forever.

2937
02:14:12,730 --> 02:14:14,370
Oh, I'm gonna suppress fire!

2938
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:19,840
Jesus Christ!

2939
02:14:22,520 --> 02:14:24,500
I don't know where the kneeler is!

2940
02:14:26,900 --> 02:14:27,920
Oh my god, there we go.

2941
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:29,780
Are they all dead?

2942
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:32,020
Oh, we did it!

2943
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:37,220
Okay, we did it, guys!

2944
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:38,600
Look at that!

2945
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:40,600
Wait, what?

2946
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:42,260
Oh, guys, we did not do it.

2947
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:44,500
Guys, we did not do it.

2948
02:14:44,600 --> 02:14:45,100
There's more.

2949
02:14:49,300 --> 02:14:51,580
We all- I thought we did it, guys!

2950
02:14:51,900 --> 02:14:52,580
I lied!

2951
02:14:55,880 --> 02:14:56,660
I lied!

2952
02:14:57,340 --> 02:14:58,100
There's more!

2953
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:03,360
Oh, I got this!

2954
02:15:03,560 --> 02:15:04,040
What?!

2955
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:08,140
Why did you- Team!

2956
02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:12,160
Team, you did not have to stand there, team!

2957
02:15:15,860 --> 02:15:18,540
Team, you did not have to all stand there!

2958
02:15:23,790 --> 02:15:24,570
Where are they?

2959
02:15:24,890 --> 02:15:25,450
I'm on it!

2960
02:15:26,390 --> 02:15:27,190
Hit the dirt!

2961
02:15:27,910 --> 02:15:28,590
Leave, leave!

2962
02:15:36,140 --> 02:15:37,340
Okay, we got one!

2963
02:15:37,340 --> 02:15:37,340
Come on.

2964
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:40,780
We got more of the babies.

2965
02:15:44,350 --> 02:15:45,510
I see you.

2966
02:15:49,590 --> 02:15:52,150
Oh my god, there's so many of them!

2967
02:15:53,970 --> 02:15:56,390
Oh, well, they got the piece of you.

2968
02:15:56,690 --> 02:15:57,710
They definitely did.

2969
02:15:58,210 --> 02:15:59,130
They definitely did.

2970
02:15:59,790 --> 02:16:01,710
Oh, they definitely got a piece of you, though.

2971
02:16:04,970 --> 02:16:05,670
Oh!

2972
02:16:05,670 --> 02:16:07,270
What the fuck?!

2973
02:16:10,660 --> 02:16:12,620
What the fuck?!

2974
02:16:12,620 --> 02:16:14,160
Teleport behind me?!

2975
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:19,540
Holy shit!

2976
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:25,900
They literally teleported behind me!

2977
02:16:34,750 --> 02:16:36,410
Oh my god, I accidentally hit myself.

2978
02:16:36,550 --> 02:16:38,070
I accidentally hit myself, but that's okay.

2979
02:16:41,780 --> 02:16:42,720
That's okay.

2980
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:46,120
Oh my god.

2981
02:16:46,320 --> 02:16:47,600
Oh my god.

2982
02:16:48,440 --> 02:16:50,320
Oh my god, where's the needler?

2983
02:16:51,620 --> 02:16:53,900
Where's the needler when you need one?!

2984
02:16:53,900 --> 02:16:55,900
Okay.

2985
02:17:02,740 --> 02:17:03,360
Let's see.

2986
02:17:03,880 --> 02:17:04,780
Where did he go?

2987
02:17:06,280 --> 02:17:06,760
Where?

2988
02:17:06,980 --> 02:17:07,860
Oh, there he is!

2989
02:17:11,330 --> 02:17:15,590
Oh my god, where's... Oh, thank god.

2990
02:17:15,890 --> 02:17:16,730
Thank god, okay.

2991
02:17:17,050 --> 02:17:17,990
I have to get ammo.

2992
02:17:21,370 --> 02:17:22,070
Here we go.

2993
02:17:22,990 --> 02:17:26,310
We're having this very intense 1v1 right now.

2994
02:17:28,670 --> 02:17:29,430
It's fine!

2995
02:17:30,710 --> 02:17:32,130
Oh my god, it's fine!

2996
02:17:38,060 --> 02:17:39,060
It's so fine!

2997
02:17:39,240 --> 02:17:40,040
And it's not fine!

2998
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:41,540
And it's not fine no more!

2999
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:43,920
It is not... Oh, it is not fine no more!

3000
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:45,360
It is not fine no more!

3001
02:17:46,140 --> 02:17:47,020
It's not fine no more!

3002
02:17:47,020 --> 02:17:47,020
It is not fine no more!

3003
02:17:47,020 --> 02:17:47,020
It's not fine!

3004
02:17:47,020 --> 02:17:47,020
It's fine!

3005
02:17:47,360 --> 02:17:48,300
We're so fine!

3006
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:49,640
We're so fine!

3007
02:17:49,940 --> 02:17:52,460
I don't know where a needler is!

3008
02:17:52,580 --> 02:17:53,780
I can't find a needler!

3009
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,580
Everyone just drops these stupid guns!

3010
02:18:00,040 --> 02:18:02,520
I haven't seen a single dealer!

3011
02:18:03,140 --> 02:18:04,800
I would if I could!

3012
02:18:10,090 --> 02:18:10,730
Okay.

3013
02:18:10,730 --> 02:18:11,050
Okay.

3014
02:18:13,190 --> 02:18:14,030
All right.

3015
02:18:17,810 --> 02:18:19,810
Give me a sec, little one.

3016
02:18:19,970 --> 02:18:21,750
Let me find another gun.

3017
02:18:22,370 --> 02:18:22,890
Thank you.

3018
02:18:23,210 --> 02:18:23,750
There we go.

3019
02:18:24,270 --> 02:18:24,770
All right.

3020
02:18:24,850 --> 02:18:25,210
Now.

3021
02:18:25,490 --> 02:18:25,770
Okay.

3022
02:18:25,930 --> 02:18:26,830
Now we fight.

3023
02:18:27,830 --> 02:18:29,110
Get out of here!

3024
02:18:29,690 --> 02:18:30,790
Get out of here!

3025
02:18:30,790 --> 02:18:30,810
Get out of here!

3026
02:18:30,810 --> 02:18:30,890
Okay.

3027
02:18:38,240 --> 02:18:38,780
What?

3028
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:40,040
There we go.

3029
02:18:41,880 --> 02:18:42,720
Oh shit!

3030
02:18:42,940 --> 02:18:43,640
Oh shit!

3031
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:44,940
You're not- You're not baby!

3032
02:18:47,740 --> 02:18:48,280
Okay.

3033
02:18:49,540 --> 02:18:50,860
We should be fine now.

3034
02:18:55,140 --> 02:18:56,660
Wait, one of you had a needler.

3035
02:18:56,740 --> 02:18:57,360
I saw it!

3036
02:18:57,740 --> 02:18:58,860
I saw it!

3037
02:19:02,220 --> 02:19:02,680
Alright.

3038
02:19:07,100 --> 02:19:09,040
We're just gonna hold on to that for now.

3039
02:19:10,760 --> 02:19:12,680
Actually, maybe we don't need the needler.

3040
02:19:12,920 --> 02:19:13,380
Not yet.

3041
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:14,520
Not yet.

3042
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:15,620
We'll be fine for now.

3043
02:19:18,040 --> 02:19:19,060
Oh my god!

3044
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:20,080
We need the needler!

3045
02:19:21,240 --> 02:19:22,200
Wait, actually no.

3046
02:19:22,340 --> 02:19:24,780
These guys- These guys- I forgot.

3047
02:19:24,980 --> 02:19:26,540
These guys- We don't need the needler.

3048
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:31,680
Hello?

3049
02:19:35,150 --> 02:19:35,870
Okay, nice.

3050
02:19:36,550 --> 02:19:37,310
Oh shit!

3051
02:19:37,610 --> 02:19:38,710
Oh, I just got rid of his shield.

3052
02:19:38,990 --> 02:19:40,830
I'm going to call for reinforcements.

3053
02:19:41,030 --> 02:19:43,790
There's no sense going in with anything less than full strength.

3054
02:19:44,890 --> 02:19:45,990
Cortana to foe hammer.

3055
02:19:46,350 --> 02:19:46,650
All right.

3056
02:19:47,150 --> 02:19:47,930
Additional support troops.

3057
02:19:48,050 --> 02:19:48,390
We do.

3058
02:19:48,630 --> 02:19:50,330
We're going to open the shuttle bay door again.

3059
02:19:54,510 --> 02:19:54,990
Please.

3060
02:19:55,270 --> 02:19:56,030
Send help!

3061
02:19:57,130 --> 02:19:57,610
SOS!

3062
02:19:59,550 --> 02:20:00,030
SOS!

3063
02:20:02,550 --> 02:20:03,150
SOS!

3064
02:20:03,150 --> 02:20:03,630
Oh no.

3065
02:20:04,870 --> 02:20:05,730
I'll stay here.

3066
02:20:08,670 --> 02:20:09,270
Goodbye!

3067
02:20:09,490 --> 02:20:09,810
Close door!

3068
02:20:09,930 --> 02:20:10,270
Close door!

3069
02:20:10,370 --> 02:20:10,770
Close door!

3070
02:20:15,070 --> 02:20:15,670
Hello?

3071
02:20:18,810 --> 02:20:19,690
Yeah, nice.

3072
02:20:22,290 --> 02:20:23,770
I gotta remember my energy level.

3073
02:20:26,890 --> 02:20:28,850
I'm just remembering my shields real quick.

3074
02:20:30,270 --> 02:20:30,690
Hello?

3075
02:20:31,730 --> 02:20:32,490
Give me a sec.

3076
02:20:33,710 --> 02:20:34,690
Come on, I know you want to peek.

3077
02:20:35,710 --> 02:20:36,870
I know you're here.

3078
02:20:40,980 --> 02:20:41,640
Come on!

3079
02:20:41,800 --> 02:20:42,880
Look at me in the eye!

3080
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:49,060
Okay, nice.

3081
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:50,580
I need your gun.

3082
02:20:51,940 --> 02:20:52,400
There we go.

3083
02:20:54,540 --> 02:20:55,700
I can't- I'm too scared.

3084
02:20:56,660 --> 02:20:59,440
The last time I tried to punch somebody, I died.

3085
02:21:00,700 --> 02:21:02,160
I was in a death loop.

3086
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:05,220
I'm too scared, guys.

3087
02:21:05,440 --> 02:21:07,060
I was in a death loop.

3088
02:21:07,320 --> 02:21:09,560
I don't want to go through that again.

3089
02:21:16,230 --> 02:21:17,050
Oh my god.

3090
02:21:20,860 --> 02:21:24,480
No, I need- Oh no.

3091
02:21:24,700 --> 02:21:26,060
Come on, recharge my shield!

3092
02:21:31,020 --> 02:21:32,400
Nice, my shield's recharged.

3093
02:21:35,640 --> 02:21:37,060
Oh nice, SOS!

3094
02:21:39,220 --> 02:21:40,520
It's Sergeant Johnson!

3095
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:41,420
Oh man!

3096
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:42,920
Welcome back, sir!

3097
02:21:47,750 --> 02:21:48,750
Welcome back!

3098
02:21:54,900 --> 02:21:56,960
That's- Oh my god.

3099
02:21:57,360 --> 02:21:57,780
Here we go.

3100
02:22:00,240 --> 02:22:01,040
Look at that.

3101
02:22:01,140 --> 02:22:02,640
See, I'm not afraid anymore.

3102
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:04,500
There's a gun.

3103
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:05,860
Oh, there's the gun.

3104
02:22:07,240 --> 02:22:09,600
I got Sergeant Johnson here.

3105
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:12,920
Sergeant Johnson number four!

3106
02:22:13,700 --> 02:22:14,620
The fourth one.

3107
02:22:15,160 --> 02:22:17,040
The fourth one is juicier.

3108
02:22:17,780 --> 02:22:19,320
Now with more juice.

3109
02:22:21,060 --> 02:22:21,820
Okay.

3110
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:26,200
Alright, nice.

3111
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:26,260
Look at this.

3112
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:30,580
Oh, shit!

3113
02:22:33,260 --> 02:22:34,000
What is that?

3114
02:22:34,260 --> 02:22:34,800
What is that?

3115
02:22:35,480 --> 02:22:41,580
Why is the poor- they- Why is that- I don't trust anything anymore.

3116
02:22:43,580 --> 02:22:44,380
Ok, checkpoint.

3117
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:50,040
Oh shit!

3118
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:54,140
Alright, I thought that... I thought there'd be more, you know?

3119
02:22:54,280 --> 02:22:56,660
I thought he'd be alive for a little longer.

3120
02:22:58,920 --> 02:22:59,440
What do you mean?

3121
02:22:59,460 --> 02:23:00,280
He was right here!

3122
02:23:02,140 --> 02:23:06,860
Oh, is that my shield rechar- Okay, I was so locked in, I never noticed that was the sound of my shield recharging.

3123
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:10,340
Okay, I'm on the third floor now.

3124
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:15,820
Keep it up!

3125
02:23:16,560 --> 02:23:17,640
Holy fuck.

3126
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:19,100
What is this?

3127
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:21,580
That's right, I did that.

3128
02:23:22,280 --> 02:23:23,540
That's right, you're welcome.

3129
02:23:24,880 --> 02:23:29,040
Oh, I feel like a hunter's gonna come up for it anytime soon.

3130
02:23:29,580 --> 02:23:31,340
For the invisible man!

3131
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:35,900
I'm scared of the invisible man!

3132
02:23:38,940 --> 02:23:40,420
What the fuck?!

3133
02:23:40,420 --> 02:23:41,640
Hold your fire, I'm home!

3134
02:23:42,180 --> 02:23:44,420
When did these guys show up?!

3135
02:23:46,740 --> 02:23:47,500
Whoops, sorry.

3136
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:49,400
Sorry, random marines.

3137
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:51,700
That's the way to do it!

3138
02:23:52,120 --> 02:23:52,440
Alright.

3139
02:23:53,180 --> 02:23:53,700
Don't worry!

3140
02:23:53,900 --> 02:23:54,720
The ninja hunters.

3141
02:23:58,440 --> 02:24:00,180
Oh my god, I thought that was gonna hit me.

3142
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:03,120
Alright, forward we go!

3143
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:04,800
Mike, I can't see anything!

3144
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:05,760
Oh, don't worry!

3145
02:24:05,860 --> 02:24:06,440
Just press tab!

3146
02:24:07,100 --> 02:24:07,360
Haha!

3147
02:24:08,040 --> 02:24:09,800
You can see everything in the remastered!

3148
02:24:15,910 --> 02:24:16,770
There we go!

3149
02:24:16,870 --> 02:24:17,590
Left, right.

3150
02:24:18,450 --> 02:24:19,450
I miss ya!

3151
02:24:20,250 --> 02:24:21,350
Wait, is there stuff here?

3152
02:24:21,570 --> 02:24:21,770
Oh!

3153
02:24:22,050 --> 02:24:22,470
I can't!

3154
02:24:22,730 --> 02:24:23,170
Yes!

3155
02:24:23,550 --> 02:24:24,870
Thank god people died here!

3156
02:24:26,690 --> 02:24:27,550
Thank god!

3157
02:24:27,770 --> 02:24:28,610
Where's Sergeant Johnson?

3158
02:24:28,610 --> 02:24:30,710
Oh my god!

3159
02:24:30,910 --> 02:24:31,270
It's empathy!

3160
02:24:31,930 --> 02:24:32,170
Haha!

3161
02:24:32,530 --> 02:24:35,590
What if they actually ran into my missile there?

3162
02:24:36,110 --> 02:24:37,330
When I did this?

3163
02:24:40,370 --> 02:24:41,270
What's that?

3164
02:24:41,850 --> 02:24:42,530
Captain Keys?

3165
02:24:45,170 --> 02:24:46,070
What's that?

3166
02:24:46,710 --> 02:24:47,430
Hello?

3167
02:24:48,350 --> 02:24:48,670
Oh!

3168
02:24:49,530 --> 02:24:50,730
Oh, we were sleeping!

3169
02:24:51,050 --> 02:24:51,970
I- Ah!

3170
02:24:52,150 --> 02:24:52,190
Ah!

3171
02:24:52,390 --> 02:24:53,090
Oh shit!

3172
02:24:53,390 --> 02:24:54,110
Oh shit!

3173
02:24:54,410 --> 02:24:54,810
Oh!

3174
02:24:57,650 --> 02:24:59,250
Why did you fire!

3175
02:25:00,090 --> 02:25:01,570
Why did you fire?

3176
02:25:03,750 --> 02:25:04,770
Keep it up!

3177
02:25:05,870 --> 02:25:07,590
What the fuck, Sergeant?

3178
02:25:08,210 --> 02:25:08,910
My fault!

3179
02:25:09,470 --> 02:25:10,110
Yes!

3180
02:25:10,250 --> 02:25:12,150
No wonder it was your fault!

3181
02:25:12,770 --> 02:25:13,570
Yes it is!

3182
02:25:13,990 --> 02:25:15,170
Yes it is!

3183
02:25:15,170 --> 02:25:15,290
Yes it is!

3184
02:25:21,350 --> 02:25:24,390
Bro, why can't my AI be like their AI?

3185
02:25:28,400 --> 02:25:29,760
Oh my god!

3186
02:25:30,760 --> 02:25:32,560
That was so bullshit!

3187
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:36,000
That- Are you se- Men!

3188
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:36,700
Men!

3189
02:25:37,340 --> 02:25:37,540
Men!

3190
02:25:38,430 --> 02:25:38,780
Please!

3191
02:25:39,540 --> 02:25:40,020
My men!

3192
02:25:45,880 --> 02:25:46,580
Why?

3193
02:25:46,980 --> 02:25:48,240
Oh my god!

3194
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:50,080
Oh my god!

3195
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:51,480
Oh you- Please!

3196
02:25:51,820 --> 02:25:55,060
Don't stay from my- And now there was one!

3197
02:25:55,560 --> 02:25:57,540
Now- After all that!

3198
02:25:57,880 --> 02:25:58,880
Now there's one!

3199
02:25:59,060 --> 02:25:59,480
Here it is!

3200
02:26:06,470 --> 02:26:08,270
There's only one left!

3201
02:26:11,410 --> 02:26:13,210
There's always been one!

3202
02:26:13,570 --> 02:26:13,910
Oh!

3203
02:26:15,490 --> 02:26:16,870
Alright, let's go!

3204
02:26:17,270 --> 02:26:18,590
To the control center!

3205
02:26:20,870 --> 02:26:21,330
Oh!

3206
02:26:21,570 --> 02:26:21,810
Oh!

3207
02:26:22,030 --> 02:26:22,850
That's not important?

3208
02:26:23,050 --> 02:26:24,350
Oh, I thought that'd be important!

3209
02:26:26,230 --> 02:26:26,650
Oh!

3210
02:26:30,590 --> 02:26:31,830
This is gonna be awkward!

3211
02:26:32,250 --> 02:26:34,510
They're gonna be like, what happened to reinforcements?

3212
02:26:34,590 --> 02:26:34,990
I don't know!

3213
02:26:35,150 --> 02:26:36,850
They like, threw a nade on themselves!

3214
02:26:37,230 --> 02:26:39,510
Like, I- There was nothing I could do!

3215
02:26:39,990 --> 02:26:41,190
There was-

3216
02:26:44,610 --> 02:26:47,030
I-I cannot stop them from themselves!

3217
02:26:47,230 --> 02:26:47,750
I'm sorry!

3218
02:26:47,750 --> 02:26:47,950
Alright!

3219
02:26:50,830 --> 02:26:52,370
I can't stop that!

3220
02:26:52,970 --> 02:26:53,510
I can't stop that!

3221
02:26:57,700 --> 02:27:00,100
What war- Thank you for the super chat!

3222
02:27:00,220 --> 02:27:00,440
Thank you!

3223
02:27:00,620 --> 02:27:01,040
Thank you!

3224
02:27:05,880 --> 02:27:07,740
I don't have to fuck this one guy in particular!

3225
02:27:11,320 --> 02:27:12,340
That's rough, buddy!

3226
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:14,820
There you go!

3227
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:18,200
Alright!

3228
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:20,300
I'm so fucked!

3229
02:27:26,130 --> 02:27:27,670
I assume it's this way, right?

3230
02:27:31,500 --> 02:27:32,960
We must be in the brig!

3231
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:34,580
These look like holding cells!

3232
02:27:34,720 --> 02:27:34,940
Yeah!

3233
02:27:35,320 --> 02:27:37,460
There are probably multiple detention stations!

3234
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:39,320
The captain must be in one of them!

3235
02:27:39,460 --> 02:27:40,600
We need to keep looking for him!

3236
02:27:41,540 --> 02:27:41,740
Alright!

3237
02:27:41,940 --> 02:27:42,280
Freedom!

3238
02:27:42,540 --> 02:27:43,280
Let them go!

3239
02:27:44,020 --> 02:27:44,500
What?

3240
02:27:44,600 --> 02:27:45,080
I can't freedom?

3241
02:27:46,520 --> 02:27:47,000
Hello?

3242
02:27:47,180 --> 02:27:47,440
Captain?

3243
02:27:50,420 --> 02:27:50,900
Captain?

3244
02:27:51,360 --> 02:27:52,460
Are you in here?

3245
02:27:53,820 --> 02:27:55,140
How do you fire so fast?

3246
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:56,560
Oh, I just- I just click it!

3247
02:27:57,380 --> 02:27:58,220
Just spam it!

3248
02:27:59,100 --> 02:27:59,800
It's just that- Wait!

3249
02:27:59,840 --> 02:28:00,420
Is that Johnson?

3250
02:28:00,900 --> 02:28:02,000
Johnson number five?

3251
02:28:02,340 --> 02:28:02,620
Bro!

3252
02:28:02,780 --> 02:28:02,940
Good!

3253
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:05,120
You- You spawned and dead?

3254
02:28:09,940 --> 02:28:10,420
Okay!

3255
02:28:10,420 --> 02:28:11,940
At least we got meds though!

3256
02:28:13,160 --> 02:28:14,540
Just click really fast!

3257
02:28:15,320 --> 02:28:17,900
I played FPS games way too much, that's how.

3258
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:23,040
Dude, that's the only reason why I clicked so fast.

3259
02:28:26,300 --> 02:28:28,600
I played a lot of FPS games.

3260
02:28:34,730 --> 02:28:35,470
Oh my god!

3261
02:28:35,570 --> 02:28:36,030
I see him!

3262
02:28:36,370 --> 02:28:37,450
I see him!

3263
02:28:37,630 --> 02:28:39,090
He's like right over here!

3264
02:28:44,910 --> 02:28:45,790
Oh my god!

3265
02:28:49,440 --> 02:28:50,160
Oh god!

3266
02:28:51,400 --> 02:28:52,440
He's right there!

3267
02:28:53,180 --> 02:28:54,860
He's like literally right there!

3268
02:28:59,700 --> 02:29:00,540
Oh my god!

3269
02:29:00,780 --> 02:29:00,840
Oh my god!

3270
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:02,260
How many are there?

3271
02:29:15,990 --> 02:29:16,550
Stop!

3272
02:29:16,730 --> 02:29:18,250
Why are there so many of you?

3273
02:29:22,290 --> 02:29:23,010
That's right!

3274
02:29:23,250 --> 02:29:23,970
Are you mad?

3275
02:29:24,270 --> 02:29:24,850
That's right!

3276
02:29:24,990 --> 02:29:25,490
Get mad!

3277
02:29:26,530 --> 02:29:27,710
I'm mad too!

3278
02:29:27,710 --> 02:29:27,830
No!

3279
02:29:33,410 --> 02:29:33,850
Alright!

3280
02:29:35,570 --> 02:29:36,450
Holy shit!

3281
02:29:36,550 --> 02:29:37,590
You're still alive!

3282
02:29:37,950 --> 02:29:38,470
Oh my god!

3283
02:29:38,550 --> 02:29:38,830
I've ran out!

3284
02:29:39,150 --> 02:29:40,350
I've ran out of ammo!

3285
02:29:41,210 --> 02:29:41,970
Don't worry!

3286
02:29:42,210 --> 02:29:43,190
I killed two more!

3287
02:29:44,250 --> 02:29:45,410
Just for this!

3288
02:29:49,460 --> 02:29:49,840
What?

3289
02:29:50,620 --> 02:29:52,040
Is that it?

3290
02:29:52,440 --> 02:29:53,280
I got them all?

3291
02:29:53,580 --> 02:29:54,620
I got them all!

3292
02:29:56,700 --> 02:29:58,060
Alright!

3293
02:29:58,300 --> 02:29:58,380
Alright!

3294
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:01,800
Freedom!

3295
02:30:03,160 --> 02:30:04,520
Freedom!

3296
02:30:06,620 --> 02:30:07,400
Keys?

3297
02:30:07,700 --> 02:30:08,740
Is that you?

3298
02:30:09,560 --> 02:30:10,660
Captain Keys!

3299
02:30:10,660 --> 02:30:12,620
You two know better than this!

3300
02:30:13,880 --> 02:30:14,400
Thanks!

3301
02:30:18,210 --> 02:30:18,730
Marines!

3302
02:30:19,330 --> 02:30:20,750
Lock and load your weapons!

3303
02:30:20,910 --> 02:30:21,770
Let's be ready to move!

3304
02:30:22,230 --> 02:30:23,010
We did it!

3305
02:30:27,610 --> 02:30:32,870
While the Covenant had us locked up in here, I overheard the guards talking about this ring world.

3306
02:30:33,450 --> 02:30:34,330
They call it...

3307
02:30:35,090 --> 02:30:35,350
Halo!

3308
02:30:36,570 --> 02:30:37,350
Halo drop!

3309
02:30:37,350 --> 02:30:38,310
John!

3310
02:30:38,570 --> 02:30:38,690
Halo!

3311
02:30:38,870 --> 02:30:39,310
That's me!

3312
02:30:41,130 --> 02:30:42,310
He said the thing!

3313
02:30:57,720 --> 02:30:59,000
Wait, he can understand?

3314
02:30:59,240 --> 02:31:00,020
They speak English?

3315
02:31:00,740 --> 02:31:02,720
Halo controls the fate of the universe.

3316
02:31:15,240 --> 02:31:15,780
Oh!

3317
02:31:20,380 --> 02:31:20,920
Oh!

3318
02:31:24,830 --> 02:31:26,590
That's also something I know from Halo.

3319
02:31:31,460 --> 02:31:32,920
I have a new mission for you.

3320
02:31:33,160 --> 02:31:36,240
We need to beat the Covenant to Halo's control room.

3321
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:38,080
Okay, so we gotta get Halo.

3322
02:31:38,260 --> 02:31:38,660
Let's move!

3323
02:31:39,220 --> 02:31:39,520
Yes, sir!

3324
02:31:39,660 --> 02:31:39,920
Okay, sir!

3325
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:41,920
He's like, fort fort!

3326
02:31:42,180 --> 02:31:42,700
Fort fort!

3327
02:31:44,260 --> 02:31:45,860
Alright, I got you guys!

3328
02:31:46,240 --> 02:31:47,820
I think Keys is gonna die.

3329
02:31:49,320 --> 02:31:52,100
Guys, I don't know if I could protect Keys, guys!

3330
02:31:53,680 --> 02:31:54,200
Guys!

3331
02:31:56,080 --> 02:32:00,020
Knowing my track record, someone's gonna die!

3332
02:32:05,700 --> 02:32:07,880
I know my track record!

3333
02:32:12,100 --> 02:32:14,920
Someone is absolutely gonna die!

3334
02:32:17,500 --> 02:32:18,660
I hear him!

3335
02:32:20,660 --> 02:32:21,500
I hear ya!

3336
02:32:23,500 --> 02:32:26,280
Guys, I don't know if I could protect Keys, guys!

3337
02:32:26,280 --> 02:32:27,380
I don't know!

3338
02:32:33,560 --> 02:32:34,700
Is there anybody on the other side?

3339
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:35,880
Okay, we have to go this side.

3340
02:32:36,020 --> 02:32:37,060
Okay, that's what...

3341
02:32:37,060 --> 02:32:37,900
At least now I know.

3342
02:32:39,400 --> 02:32:40,620
Okay, maybe I'll hit him?

3343
02:32:46,320 --> 02:32:46,960
Guys, please!

3344
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:47,400
Please!

3345
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:49,720
Guys, I'm trying to protect all of you guys!

3346
02:32:50,020 --> 02:32:50,540
Guys, please!

3347
02:32:53,960 --> 02:32:54,860
Okay, this way.

3348
02:33:00,560 --> 02:33:01,080
Okay.

3349
02:33:02,980 --> 02:33:04,540
Alright, I wanna get rid of the mini guys.

3350
02:33:07,880 --> 02:33:09,360
Get out of here, mini-mees!

3351
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:11,560
Please!

3352
02:33:11,800 --> 02:33:13,020
Stop shooting me!

3353
02:33:13,360 --> 02:33:14,740
Oh my god!

3354
02:33:15,080 --> 02:33:16,900
Stop shooting your own men!

3355
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:23,900
Okay, that was not my fault.

3356
02:33:27,740 --> 02:33:29,500
That was not my fault, guys.

3357
02:33:30,520 --> 02:33:31,600
I was...

3358
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:34,160
They did that to themselves!

3359
02:33:34,900 --> 02:33:36,020
We saw it!

3360
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:38,640
We all saw that happen!

3361
02:33:38,820 --> 02:33:39,940
I didn't do it!

3362
02:33:40,120 --> 02:33:41,140
I didn't do that!

3363
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:43,690
Am I, like, backtracking?

3364
02:33:48,310 --> 02:33:49,970
You have to backtrack, right?

3365
02:33:53,630 --> 02:33:55,050
Guys, where do we go?

3366
02:33:56,710 --> 02:33:57,250
Where...

3367
02:33:57,250 --> 02:33:57,890
Oh!

3368
02:33:57,890 --> 02:33:58,070
Oh!

3369
02:33:58,110 --> 02:33:58,810
Oh!

3370
02:34:03,980 --> 02:34:05,240
I

3371
02:34:08,330 --> 02:34:25,790
didn't notice the glowing blue knives.

3372
02:34:26,270 --> 02:34:28,290
I didn't notice...

3373
02:34:28,290 --> 02:34:32,490
With these...

3374
02:34:34,820 --> 02:34:36,260
What did he kill?

3375
02:34:36,500 --> 02:34:37,840
Wait, did he kill Keyes?

3376
02:34:39,080 --> 02:34:40,060
Oh, you're fine.

3377
02:34:40,400 --> 02:34:41,340
Keyes is okay.

3378
02:34:50,260 --> 02:34:50,880
It's okay.

3379
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:52,740
Keyes was the only one that lived.

3380
02:34:55,860 --> 02:34:56,840
Alright, there we go.

3381
02:35:13,580 --> 02:35:15,360
That's right, you sign up for this.

3382
02:35:15,620 --> 02:35:17,680
You wanted to go to space, didn't you?

3383
02:35:17,900 --> 02:35:19,440
You thought Earth was boring.

3384
02:35:19,720 --> 02:35:20,900
You sign up for this.

3385
02:35:24,660 --> 02:35:25,180
Oh.

3386
02:35:26,860 --> 02:35:27,380
Oh.

3387
02:35:28,060 --> 02:35:29,480
Turn around, Keyes!

3388
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:30,460
Turn around!

3389
02:35:32,640 --> 02:35:33,680
Keyes, shut up!

3390
02:35:43,480 --> 02:35:44,000
Okay.

3391
02:35:45,160 --> 02:35:46,640
Now, alright, there we go.

3392
02:35:49,200 --> 02:35:49,460
Alright.

3393
02:35:52,320 --> 02:35:52,920
Okay.

3394
02:35:54,840 --> 02:35:55,440
Alright.

3395
02:35:56,380 --> 02:35:57,600
No, not Keyes!

3396
02:35:57,760 --> 02:35:58,180
No!

3397
02:36:08,650 --> 02:36:09,250
Please.

3398
02:36:09,590 --> 02:36:10,190
Please.

3399
02:36:10,630 --> 02:36:11,230
Please.

3400
02:36:13,330 --> 02:36:15,030
Oh my god, I missed all the shadows.

3401
02:36:15,730 --> 02:36:16,330
Please.

3402
02:36:16,670 --> 02:36:18,830
Please, no, don't get Keyes!

3403
02:36:18,890 --> 02:36:19,470
No, not Keyes!

3404
02:36:19,630 --> 02:36:20,230
Oh my god!

3405
02:36:25,380 --> 02:36:26,960
What do I do?

3406
02:36:28,520 --> 02:36:29,240
Okay.

3407
02:36:36,040 --> 02:36:38,860
I wish I could be like, Ashley, stay here!

3408
02:36:39,500 --> 02:36:40,640
Keyes, stay here!

3409
02:36:41,300 --> 02:36:42,120
Why can't...

3410
02:36:44,300 --> 02:36:46,120
Why can't I be like...

3411
02:36:46,360 --> 02:36:47,740
Keyes, stay here!

3412
02:36:48,080 --> 02:36:48,800
Keyes!

3413
02:36:49,100 --> 02:36:50,980
Stay here, please!

3414
02:36:50,980 --> 02:36:51,020
Please!

3415
02:36:51,400 --> 02:36:54,780
Negative, Corazana, I've been engaged by Covenant Air Patrol!

3416
02:36:54,940 --> 02:36:55,920
Okay, Keyes!

3417
02:36:56,040 --> 02:36:56,540
Okay, Keyes!

3418
02:36:56,580 --> 02:36:57,160
Stay here!

3419
02:36:57,740 --> 02:36:59,280
Get in the locker, Keyes!

3420
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:00,880
Get in the locker!

3421
02:37:14,210 --> 02:37:16,150
No, I just don't like the Assault Rifle!

3422
02:37:16,670 --> 02:37:18,110
The Energy Gun is so...

3423
02:37:18,110 --> 02:37:18,830
More accurate!

3424
02:37:19,510 --> 02:37:23,330
If you and the Chief can get us into one of those Covenant Dropships, I can fly us out of here!

3425
02:37:23,330 --> 02:37:24,770
I don't know, I'm not a fan of it!

3426
02:37:24,770 --> 02:37:25,750
Cause like, it's not...

3427
02:37:25,750 --> 02:37:28,250
I feel like the Energy Guns are much more accurate!

3428
02:37:31,910 --> 02:37:32,890
We'll just stay here!

3429
02:37:34,130 --> 02:37:35,370
We'll stay here, guys!

3430
02:37:36,150 --> 02:37:37,410
Wait, do they like come...

3431
02:37:37,410 --> 02:37:38,410
Infinitely come back?

3432
02:37:40,390 --> 02:37:41,410
Are they like...

3433
02:37:41,410 --> 02:37:43,550
Do they infinitely spot if I don't head forward?

3434
02:37:44,970 --> 02:37:46,050
I just wanna know!

3435
02:37:46,150 --> 02:37:46,430
Take that!

3436
02:37:46,770 --> 02:37:47,450
Okay, that's good!

3437
02:37:48,310 --> 02:37:48,830
Take that!

3438
02:37:48,830 --> 02:37:49,050
That's good!

3439
02:37:49,230 --> 02:37:49,730
We'll stay here!

3440
02:37:50,070 --> 02:37:50,590
Sorry!

3441
02:37:50,710 --> 02:37:50,810
Hey!

3442
02:37:50,910 --> 02:37:51,590
We'll stay here!

3443
02:37:52,390 --> 02:37:53,430
Outta my way, mate!

3444
02:37:54,410 --> 02:37:55,930
Outta my way, mate!

3445
02:37:56,450 --> 02:37:56,690
Yeah!

3446
02:37:57,090 --> 02:37:58,170
Yeah, we showed them!

3447
02:38:03,850 --> 02:38:04,350
Alright!

3448
02:38:04,910 --> 02:38:05,170
Okay!

3449
02:38:05,990 --> 02:38:06,670
We're fine!

3450
02:38:07,410 --> 02:38:08,190
For now!

3451
02:38:18,190 --> 02:38:18,710
Guys!

3452
02:38:19,750 --> 02:38:20,270
I...

3453
02:38:25,190 --> 02:38:26,190
Guys!

3454
02:38:26,770 --> 02:38:27,330
Stay here!

3455
02:38:27,730 --> 02:38:28,850
Stay here!

3456
02:38:29,330 --> 02:38:30,550
Stay here!

3457
02:38:30,550 --> 02:38:30,670
Stay here!

3458
02:38:31,010 --> 02:38:32,310
Do not leave!

3459
02:38:39,050 --> 02:38:39,550
Okay!

3460
02:38:40,370 --> 02:38:42,070
We can leave now!

3461
02:38:44,210 --> 02:38:45,830
Alright, everybody!

3462
02:38:46,530 --> 02:38:47,930
Slow and steady!

3463
02:38:49,010 --> 02:38:51,190
Slow and steady, everyone!

3464
02:38:58,280 --> 02:38:59,600
Slow and steady!

3465
02:39:00,560 --> 02:39:02,260
Slow and steady, men!

3466
02:39:02,680 --> 02:39:05,560
I don't trust any of you guys anymore!

3467
02:39:07,820 --> 02:39:08,460
Okay!

3468
02:39:12,600 --> 02:39:13,620
I'll try...

3469
02:39:13,620 --> 02:39:15,020
I'll try the assault rifle again!

3470
02:39:21,160 --> 02:39:22,880
He almost died there!

3471
02:39:23,340 --> 02:39:25,500
He felt like he wanted to play a little!

3472
02:39:27,900 --> 02:39:29,060
Oh my god, please!

3473
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:31,740
I don't fight him!

3474
02:39:33,780 --> 02:39:34,720
Oh, thank god!

3475
02:39:35,480 --> 02:39:36,020
That's it!

3476
02:39:38,890 --> 02:39:40,330
Oh, thank god!

3477
02:39:41,270 --> 02:39:42,550
Oh, we're safe!

3478
02:39:43,290 --> 02:39:44,370
We're safe!

3479
02:39:45,650 --> 02:39:48,110
Oh, thank you, John Halo!

3480
02:39:48,990 --> 02:39:51,070
Give me a minute to interface with the ship's controls.

3481
02:39:51,070 --> 02:39:52,210
Ah, no need.

3482
02:39:52,450 --> 02:39:54,110
I'll take this bird out myself.

3483
02:39:56,180 --> 02:39:56,580
Hunter!

3484
02:39:56,880 --> 02:39:57,200
What?

3485
02:39:57,460 --> 02:39:57,800
No!

3486
02:39:58,220 --> 02:39:58,620
No!

3487
02:39:59,340 --> 02:39:59,740
No!

3488
02:39:59,860 --> 02:40:00,100
Please!

3489
02:40:00,860 --> 02:40:01,500
Please!

3490
02:40:01,780 --> 02:40:02,980
Please be cutscene!

3491
02:40:03,260 --> 02:40:04,060
Please be cutscene!

3492
02:40:04,460 --> 02:40:05,220
Oh, thank god!

3493
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:06,240
Nice!

3494
02:40:06,520 --> 02:40:07,840
Time for a little payback!

3495
02:40:08,360 --> 02:40:09,340
You go, Keys!

3496
02:40:13,730 --> 02:40:14,990
Oh my god!

3497
02:40:15,750 --> 02:40:16,690
Thank god!

3498
02:40:17,050 --> 02:40:18,390
That was crazy!

3499
02:40:19,770 --> 02:40:21,490
You go, Captain!

3500
02:40:21,490 --> 02:40:21,750
He's dead!

3501
02:40:26,150 --> 02:40:26,790
Oh!

3502
02:40:30,500 --> 02:40:36,060
The Covenant believed that what they call the Silent Cartographer is somewhere under this island.

3503
02:40:36,280 --> 02:40:40,280
The Cartographer is a map room that will lead us to Halo's control center.

3504
02:40:41,760 --> 02:40:44,360
The island has multiple structures and installations.

3505
02:40:44,820 --> 02:40:46,780
One of them contains the map room.

3506
02:40:46,980 --> 02:40:48,120
The map room?

3507
02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:52,760
Oh, shit!

3508
02:40:53,300 --> 02:40:54,080
What's this?

3509
02:40:54,640 --> 02:40:55,520
Is it D-Day?

3510
02:40:56,600 --> 02:40:57,620
It's D-Day.

3511
02:41:00,060 --> 02:41:00,840
That's right!

3512
02:41:04,840 --> 02:41:06,440
Jesus, the pistol is so good.

3513
02:41:13,060 --> 02:41:13,580
Okay.

3514
02:41:14,140 --> 02:41:14,640
I'm gonna need up.

3515
02:41:15,760 --> 02:41:16,700
Okay, I knocked the needle.

3516
02:41:18,520 --> 02:41:19,040
Nice.

3517
02:41:21,640 --> 02:41:22,640
Wait, that's not...

3518
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:22,900
Oh, yeah.

3519
02:41:22,900 --> 02:41:23,960
That's why I want it.

3520
02:41:24,500 --> 02:41:25,920
Give me that pistol!

3521
02:41:28,160 --> 02:41:29,540
Look, a Mark V.

3522
02:41:30,020 --> 02:41:30,760
What's that?

3523
02:41:34,120 --> 02:41:34,460
Whoa!

3524
02:41:36,120 --> 02:41:37,240
Oh my god!

3525
02:41:37,360 --> 02:41:37,860
He cheated!

3526
02:41:40,120 --> 02:41:41,440
Get out of here!

3527
02:41:42,360 --> 02:41:43,740
I got cheated!

3528
02:41:43,940 --> 02:41:45,140
He tried to fucking flick!

3529
02:41:46,660 --> 02:41:48,060
He was camping!

3530
02:41:54,290 --> 02:41:55,870
It's the beach episode!

3531
02:41:56,090 --> 02:41:56,390
Oh my god!

3532
02:41:56,510 --> 02:41:57,950
Just in time for my beach episode!

3533
02:41:58,130 --> 02:41:58,670
Tomorrow, guys!

3534
02:41:58,750 --> 02:41:59,790
Guys, we'll be there, right?

3535
02:42:01,690 --> 02:42:02,490
Holy fuck!

3536
02:42:02,570 --> 02:42:03,770
That was a firing squad!

3537
02:42:04,590 --> 02:42:06,430
Just in time for our beach episode!

3538
02:42:16,360 --> 02:42:17,520
You know it!

3539
02:42:18,660 --> 02:42:22,300
Open for reveal tomorrow at 5pm PSC, guys!

3540
02:42:27,180 --> 02:42:28,240
Just in time!

3541
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:29,740
A beach mission!

3542
02:42:29,880 --> 02:42:30,100
No!

3543
02:42:30,100 --> 02:42:30,180
Oh!

3544
02:42:31,700 --> 02:42:33,760
Does anyone else wanna drive?

3545
02:42:34,160 --> 02:42:34,320
Let's go!

3546
02:42:34,320 --> 02:42:34,400
Oh!

3547
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:35,680
Okay!

3548
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:37,480
Okay, let's move out!

3549
02:42:40,940 --> 02:42:42,260
Okay, guys!

3550
02:42:43,240 --> 02:42:45,480
I guess I'll drive!

3551
02:42:49,660 --> 02:42:51,080
I believe in all of you!

3552
02:42:51,700 --> 02:42:51,940
Whoo!

3553
02:42:54,960 --> 02:42:55,740
You know what?

3554
02:42:55,840 --> 02:42:56,600
Does it really matter?

3555
02:42:56,800 --> 02:42:57,900
Are they coming over anyway?

3556
02:42:58,660 --> 02:43:00,540
It's just me and the team, right?

3557
02:43:00,700 --> 02:43:01,920
Okay, I'll just move forward.

3558
02:43:02,680 --> 02:43:05,100
Okay, we don't have to actually kill them, right?

3559
02:43:05,680 --> 02:43:06,840
I can just move forward?

3560
02:43:13,200 --> 02:43:14,020
Don't worry!

3561
02:43:14,820 --> 02:43:15,440
Don't worry!

3562
02:43:15,440 --> 02:43:16,260
That's our spot!

3563
02:43:23,740 --> 02:43:24,800
Oh, I got him!

3564
02:43:27,850 --> 02:43:29,070
That's fucking Rhett!

3565
02:43:29,690 --> 02:43:30,550
That's Rhett!

3566
02:43:31,290 --> 02:43:33,530
I've hit a hundred headshots now!

3567
02:43:36,310 --> 02:43:38,610
I feel like I've hit more, to be fair.

3568
02:43:41,970 --> 02:43:44,450
There's no way I've only hit a hundred!

3569
02:43:45,350 --> 02:43:47,430
I feel like I've hit so many headshots!

3570
02:43:50,590 --> 02:43:51,410
Oh no!

3571
02:43:51,850 --> 02:43:54,650
I still hope you were able to enjoy the vibe though!

3572
02:43:55,270 --> 02:43:56,210
Thank you for the super chat!

3573
02:43:56,310 --> 02:43:57,070
Thank you, thank you!

3574
02:43:57,730 --> 02:43:58,610
I see you!

3575
02:43:59,810 --> 02:44:00,910
I see you, ward ward!

3576
02:44:01,870 --> 02:44:02,850
I see you!

3577
02:44:04,390 --> 02:44:05,730
I see you over here too!

3578
02:44:08,050 --> 02:44:09,510
Hey, you shot my ass!

3579
02:44:15,470 --> 02:44:16,630
Can I bring this?

3580
02:44:16,790 --> 02:44:17,230
I can!

3581
02:44:19,650 --> 02:44:20,570
Wait, I can!

3582
02:44:20,790 --> 02:44:21,470
Get over here!

3583
02:44:22,250 --> 02:44:23,550
I know where I parked!

3584
02:44:25,930 --> 02:44:27,690
What's the headshot Scott move?

3585
02:44:27,910 --> 02:44:27,930
Go!

3586
02:44:28,510 --> 02:44:28,630
Go!

3587
02:44:29,170 --> 02:44:29,310
Go!

3588
02:44:29,310 --> 02:44:29,790
Alright, here we go!

3589
02:44:33,980 --> 02:44:35,620
Alright, I can squeeze through this!

3590
02:44:47,540 --> 02:44:49,140
Okay, that's a bad idea!

3591
02:44:49,300 --> 02:44:49,920
That-

3592
02:44:54,720 --> 02:44:58,080
It might have been a bad idea to bring-

3593
02:45:06,060 --> 02:45:08,480
You killed him!

3594
02:45:09,960 --> 02:45:15,280
I didn't realize there were seven of them in there!

3595
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:17,240
I didn't realize!

3596
02:45:18,060 --> 02:45:18,660
Okay!

3597
02:45:19,240 --> 02:45:20,160
I didn't know!

3598
02:45:20,440 --> 02:45:22,580
There were seven of them in there!

3599
02:45:23,060 --> 02:45:23,400
Alright!

3600
02:45:24,120 --> 02:45:25,960
There was always one!

3601
02:45:26,640 --> 02:45:28,900
There was a- Team wipe!

3602
02:45:29,240 --> 02:45:30,840
Let's- I wiped the squad!

3603
02:45:31,320 --> 02:45:31,440
Yeah!

3604
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:32,120
Look at that!

3605
02:45:32,220 --> 02:45:33,060
I got team wipe!

3606
02:45:33,500 --> 02:45:35,180
It might have been my own team!

3607
02:45:38,960 --> 02:45:40,280
A wipe's a wipe!

3608
02:45:40,820 --> 02:45:45,000
I underestimated the Covenant's understanding of Halo's subsystems!

3609
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:46,300
They've locked the doors!

3610
02:45:46,680 --> 02:45:49,080
And we don't have enough firepower to get through them!

3611
02:45:49,980 --> 02:45:50,820
Cortana to Keys!

3612
02:45:51,820 --> 02:45:52,720
Yes, we need help!

3613
02:45:54,520 --> 02:45:57,360
I thought you said you were sending some men to help me!

3614
02:45:57,560 --> 02:45:59,420
I don't know where- They didn't show up!

3615
02:45:59,440 --> 02:46:00,720
They have impeded our progress!

3616
02:46:19,940 --> 02:46:21,300
In this control center?

3617
02:46:21,560 --> 02:46:22,580
Wait, I'm gonna drive down!

3618
02:46:22,580 --> 02:46:24,020
Before the Covenant!

3619
02:46:24,660 --> 02:46:26,560
And failure people is not an option!

3620
02:46:27,660 --> 02:46:28,260
Yes!

3621
02:46:28,260 --> 02:46:29,780
Echo 419 to ground teams!

3622
02:46:46,060 --> 02:46:49,180
You need to find the security override to get this door open!

3623
02:46:51,760 --> 02:46:52,920
Let me in!

3624
02:46:54,760 --> 02:46:56,100
LET ME IN!

3625
02:46:57,540 --> 02:46:59,420
I don't know what to do!

3626
02:47:00,300 --> 02:47:01,280
What the fuck do I do?

3627
02:47:01,660 --> 02:47:02,680
Oh my god!

3628
02:47:09,580 --> 02:47:10,740
What do I do?

3629
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:14,820
I have to find a security override?

3630
02:47:15,740 --> 02:47:15,880
Where?

3631
02:47:19,360 --> 02:47:21,480
I gotta backtrack now?

3632
02:47:22,320 --> 02:47:23,120
God dammit!

3633
02:47:26,060 --> 02:47:27,600
Now I have to take the car back?

3634
02:47:27,980 --> 02:47:29,160
I don't know how to take it forward!

3635
02:47:29,340 --> 02:47:30,780
I don't even know how to go in, not out!

3636
02:47:34,800 --> 02:47:36,500
Who does that?

3637
02:47:37,180 --> 02:47:38,860
The closet!

3638
02:47:40,920 --> 02:47:42,160
I can't!

3639
02:47:43,400 --> 02:47:44,960
Alright, I sound a back up!

3640
02:47:45,620 --> 02:47:45,980
Beep!

3641
02:47:46,220 --> 02:47:47,040
Beep!

3642
02:47:48,020 --> 02:47:48,980
Beep!

3643
02:47:50,080 --> 02:47:50,560
Beep!

3644
02:47:51,020 --> 02:47:51,500
Beep!

3645
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:52,960
Beep!

3646
02:47:59,000 --> 02:47:59,960
Beep!

3647
02:48:01,100 --> 02:48:02,020
Here we go.

3648
02:48:02,940 --> 02:48:03,940
I did it.

3649
02:48:06,340 --> 02:48:08,860
I'm gyrating on there.

3650
02:48:09,860 --> 02:48:10,020
Alright.

3651
02:48:11,340 --> 02:48:11,860
Here I go.

3652
02:48:12,960 --> 02:48:13,840
Back up.

3653
02:48:16,580 --> 02:48:17,140
Alright.

3654
02:48:18,280 --> 02:48:21,280
Man, I can't believe they never sent me those men to help me.

3655
02:48:23,100 --> 02:48:25,100
Must have got lost or something.

3656
02:48:29,020 --> 02:48:29,580
Alright.

3657
02:48:31,520 --> 02:48:32,340
Where do I go?

3658
02:48:32,620 --> 02:48:33,840
Do I go around here?

3659
02:48:34,960 --> 02:48:35,800
Oh, man.

3660
02:48:41,280 --> 02:48:42,100
There we go.

3661
02:48:46,750 --> 02:48:47,710
There we go.

3662
02:48:54,950 --> 02:48:55,510
Stupid.

3663
02:48:58,250 --> 02:48:59,110
There we go.

3664
02:48:59,430 --> 02:49:00,450
That should be all of them.

3665
02:49:01,210 --> 02:49:01,430
Alright.

3666
02:49:01,930 --> 02:49:04,110
Can I die if I drive off this cliff?

3667
02:49:04,730 --> 02:49:05,950
Time to find out.

3668
02:49:10,010 --> 02:49:10,910
Oh, nice.

3669
02:49:11,050 --> 02:49:11,390
I lived.

3670
02:49:11,390 --> 02:49:11,390
Good.

3671
02:49:14,410 --> 02:49:15,010
Yay!

3672
02:49:18,170 --> 02:49:18,770
Nice.

3673
02:49:20,390 --> 02:49:21,290
Fast track.

3674
02:49:22,870 --> 02:49:23,770
Speed run.

3675
02:49:26,630 --> 02:49:27,230
Okay.

3676
02:49:27,330 --> 02:49:28,630
Maybe there's something over here.

3677
02:49:32,240 --> 02:49:33,840
No, we don't need them.

3678
02:49:34,580 --> 02:49:36,800
I don't go back.

3679
02:49:37,240 --> 02:49:38,500
I only go in.

3680
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:48,360
Dead?

3681
02:49:48,540 --> 02:49:49,060
I can't tell.

3682
02:49:49,180 --> 02:49:49,400
Oh, yeah.

3683
02:49:49,440 --> 02:49:50,140
He's definitely dead.

3684
02:49:53,980 --> 02:49:54,340
Okay.

3685
02:49:54,420 --> 02:49:56,020
I don't want to use up all... Actually, no.

3686
02:49:56,220 --> 02:49:57,460
I should save ammo for that.

3687
02:49:58,380 --> 02:49:58,620
Oh.

3688
02:49:58,940 --> 02:49:59,180
Oh.

3689
02:49:59,320 --> 02:49:59,520
Whoops.

3690
02:49:59,660 --> 02:50:00,120
Oh my god.

3691
02:50:00,160 --> 02:50:01,420
I got like fucking...

3692
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:03,580
Um...

3693
02:50:04,900 --> 02:50:05,740
What's the word?

3694
02:50:09,450 --> 02:50:11,190
I got fucking light mode there.

3695
02:50:11,430 --> 02:50:12,030
Yeah, I know.

3696
02:50:12,170 --> 02:50:13,110
I was like, what the fuck?

3697
02:50:13,730 --> 02:50:14,750
That's so bad.

3698
02:50:19,230 --> 02:50:22,110
I actually got like light mode behind it from it.

3699
02:50:24,110 --> 02:50:24,570
Okay.

3700
02:50:24,590 --> 02:50:25,730
I don't have any shields.

3701
02:50:27,430 --> 02:50:27,930
Don't worry.

3702
02:50:28,010 --> 02:50:29,250
I can stay here and I'll be safe.

3703
02:50:32,070 --> 02:50:33,290
There you go.

3704
02:50:38,150 --> 02:50:39,370
Just do that.

3705
02:50:42,680 --> 02:50:43,180
Whoa!

3706
02:50:50,820 --> 02:50:52,180
I'm jiggle peeking.

3707
02:50:52,260 --> 02:50:53,080
I'm jiggle peeking.

3708
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:54,660
Modern FPS.

3709
02:50:55,340 --> 02:50:56,280
Still the same.

3710
02:51:00,120 --> 02:51:00,780
Oh shit.

3711
02:51:00,840 --> 02:51:02,120
I can't jiggle peeking anymore.

3712
02:51:03,680 --> 02:51:04,600
I got it.

3713
02:51:09,620 --> 02:51:10,320
There you go.

3714
02:51:13,660 --> 02:51:15,000
I gotta be careful right now.

3715
02:51:15,180 --> 02:51:15,960
I'm like 1 HP.

3716
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:17,600
Oh wait.

3717
02:51:17,640 --> 02:51:17,780
I don't.

3718
02:51:17,940 --> 02:51:18,180
Grenades.

3719
02:51:18,420 --> 02:51:18,540
Fuck.

3720
02:51:18,540 --> 02:51:18,620
Fuck.

3721
02:51:22,180 --> 02:51:23,680
I'm getting tired of this.

3722
02:51:24,360 --> 02:51:24,840
There we go.

3723
02:51:25,460 --> 02:51:26,280
I should kill him.

3724
02:51:27,780 --> 02:51:29,700
I'm getting tired of you all.

3725
02:51:30,160 --> 02:51:31,360
Get out of here.

3726
02:51:41,780 --> 02:51:42,900
Holy fuck.

3727
02:51:43,100 --> 02:51:44,400
That took so long to kill.

3728
02:51:45,720 --> 02:51:47,240
Yeah, I'm like 1 HP.

3729
02:51:50,100 --> 02:51:50,980
Wait, what?

3730
02:51:51,500 --> 02:51:52,840
You're still alive?

3731
02:51:54,560 --> 02:51:55,380
That's okay, right?

3732
02:51:55,760 --> 02:51:56,860
You were still alive.

3733
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:57,680
That's fucking right.

3734
02:51:57,860 --> 02:51:58,580
It's headed for you.

3735
02:51:58,820 --> 02:52:00,120
It's headed for you.

3736
02:52:00,740 --> 02:52:01,220
Wait.

3737
02:52:01,880 --> 02:52:02,620
That's right.

3738
02:52:02,880 --> 02:52:03,940
You can't run away forever.

3739
02:52:06,260 --> 02:52:07,460
Okay, maybe you can.

3740
02:52:11,340 --> 02:52:11,940
There you go.

3741
02:52:16,900 --> 02:52:18,440
You better be dead now.

3742
02:52:19,660 --> 02:52:21,120
I know he's like here somewhere.

3743
02:52:21,280 --> 02:52:22,540
There's still like...

3744
02:52:22,540 --> 02:52:23,440
Wait, is he dead?

3745
02:52:25,500 --> 02:52:26,300
I knew it.

3746
02:52:26,360 --> 02:52:27,280
I knew you weren't dead.

3747
02:52:27,580 --> 02:52:30,240
I knew you weren't dead, you fucking whore!

3748
02:52:33,370 --> 02:52:34,410
Give me your gun.

3749
02:52:36,410 --> 02:52:37,530
Oh, there's a medkit.

3750
02:52:38,030 --> 02:52:39,470
Oh no, that's just a dead guy.

3751
02:52:40,290 --> 02:52:41,590
He was very medkit-like.

3752
02:52:44,850 --> 02:52:45,290
Uh...

3753
02:52:45,290 --> 02:52:47,310
I don't know if I can bring my car over there.

3754
02:52:50,360 --> 02:52:52,200
Can I put my car over there?

3755
02:52:53,220 --> 02:52:54,680
Alright, time to find out.

3756
02:53:02,550 --> 02:53:03,410
I don't know.

3757
02:53:04,050 --> 02:53:05,910
It doesn't seem very medkit-safe.

3758
02:53:06,630 --> 02:53:07,270
It's fine.

3759
02:53:07,950 --> 02:53:09,810
I did that on purpose, so it'll...

3760
02:53:09,810 --> 02:53:12,030
It'll be like positioned just right.

3761
02:53:13,090 --> 02:53:13,550
Uh...

3762
02:53:13,550 --> 02:53:14,950
Alright, let's squeeze through this tight hole.

3763
02:53:16,750 --> 02:53:17,970
Okay, I might die.

3764
02:53:19,890 --> 02:53:21,290
It's okay, it's my shield!

3765
02:53:22,270 --> 02:53:23,750
Where fuck did they come from?

3766
02:53:28,040 --> 02:53:28,800
What the fuck?

3767
02:53:29,040 --> 02:53:30,040
They weren't there before!

3768
02:53:32,240 --> 02:53:32,900
Oh shit!

3769
02:53:33,840 --> 02:53:34,700
What the fuck?

3770
02:53:39,620 --> 02:53:40,480
Oh, thank god.

3771
02:53:40,620 --> 02:53:41,620
Okay, I don't have to do that again.

3772
02:53:41,940 --> 02:53:42,580
Oh, thank god.

3773
02:53:42,760 --> 02:53:42,920
Okay.

3774
02:53:43,420 --> 02:53:43,780
That's fine.

3775
02:53:45,940 --> 02:53:47,840
As long as I don't have to do that again, that's fine.

3776
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:53,640
Okay.

3777
02:53:55,300 --> 02:53:56,140
Nice, you're all dead.

3778
02:53:56,140 --> 02:53:57,140
Come on.

3779
02:53:58,320 --> 02:53:59,280
Where's your gun?

3780
02:53:59,820 --> 02:54:01,140
Alright, I need your better gun.

3781
02:54:01,440 --> 02:54:02,400
Holy fuck!

3782
02:54:02,560 --> 02:54:03,360
How many are there?

3783
02:54:04,840 --> 02:54:05,440
Please!

3784
02:54:06,220 --> 02:54:07,900
You have a human medkit?

3785
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:10,360
Human!

3786
02:54:10,780 --> 02:54:11,700
A medkit!

3787
02:54:18,720 --> 02:54:20,180
Okay, let me...

3788
02:54:20,180 --> 02:54:21,240
Get rid of this guy.

3789
02:54:23,460 --> 02:54:24,180
Oh my god.

3790
02:54:24,380 --> 02:54:25,540
At least I didn't get stuck.

3791
02:54:32,070 --> 02:54:32,490
Alright.

3792
02:54:32,750 --> 02:54:33,670
Get out of here!

3793
02:54:33,990 --> 02:54:35,050
You're just like little...

3794
02:54:35,050 --> 02:54:35,950
You're so annoying!

3795
02:54:38,630 --> 02:54:40,490
These little guys are so annoying!

3796
02:54:40,710 --> 02:54:42,310
They do nothing for the team!

3797
02:54:45,290 --> 02:54:46,410
Alright, now I'm up here.

3798
02:54:47,130 --> 02:54:48,230
Oh, on the beach?

3799
02:54:48,390 --> 02:54:49,150
Okay, but...

3800
02:54:49,150 --> 02:54:50,230
I'm already up here now.

3801
02:54:50,690 --> 02:54:52,010
Don't worry, I got this.

3802
02:54:53,290 --> 02:54:55,270
I like to live life on the edge.

3803
02:54:57,730 --> 02:54:59,090
Let's go find a medkit.

3804
02:55:01,150 --> 02:55:04,950
We here at Dookie, and friends do not offer cashbacks on Super Chats.

3805
02:55:05,350 --> 02:55:06,970
We are on us a button like honey.

3806
02:55:07,390 --> 02:55:07,910
Imposter!

3807
02:55:08,110 --> 02:55:09,690
Thank you for the Super Chat!

3808
02:55:09,930 --> 02:55:11,570
Thank you, thank you!

3809
02:55:12,830 --> 02:55:15,910
Alright, let's go find us a medkit, guys!

3810
02:55:16,490 --> 02:55:17,010
Let's...

3811
02:55:18,990 --> 02:55:21,210
I saw what I needed to see.

3812
02:55:21,750 --> 02:55:22,410
And I...

3813
02:55:22,410 --> 02:55:23,530
We need a medkit.

3814
02:55:23,530 --> 02:55:23,950
We need a medkit!

3815
02:55:24,670 --> 02:55:31,570
We need a medkit!

3816
02:55:31,570 --> 02:55:32,590
Alright, let's go!

3817
02:55:33,190 --> 02:55:35,110
There has to be a medkit here somewhere.

3818
02:55:35,470 --> 02:55:36,570
Oh, it's right here!

3819
02:55:36,890 --> 02:55:37,670
Holy fuck!

3820
02:55:37,890 --> 02:55:39,590
It was literally just right here!

3821
02:55:40,090 --> 02:55:42,050
Alright, thank god you guys died!

3822
02:55:43,450 --> 02:55:46,870
I told you guys, I like to live life on the edge!

3823
02:55:47,890 --> 02:55:48,910
There you go!

3824
02:55:49,210 --> 02:55:49,950
Okay, and I got...

3825
02:55:49,950 --> 02:55:50,510
There we go!

3826
02:55:51,590 --> 02:55:53,130
Alright, now I can do it!

3827
02:55:55,590 --> 02:55:56,570
Okay, I...

3828
02:55:56,570 --> 02:55:58,670
I heard the needler was good for this.

3829
02:55:58,910 --> 02:55:58,990
Okay.

3830
02:55:59,710 --> 02:56:00,870
There must be a needler here.

3831
02:56:03,890 --> 02:56:04,670
Nice, okay.

3832
02:56:05,470 --> 02:56:07,250
I knew there was like a hundred needlers.

3833
02:56:10,110 --> 02:56:10,550
Alright.

3834
02:56:13,110 --> 02:56:14,670
Wait, pistol is one shot?

3835
02:56:15,650 --> 02:56:16,090
Okay.

3836
02:56:16,490 --> 02:56:17,710
I just need to hit the orange, right?

3837
02:56:22,390 --> 02:56:22,950
What?

3838
02:56:23,110 --> 02:56:23,150
What?

3839
02:56:23,150 --> 02:56:23,230
What?

3840
02:56:23,270 --> 02:56:23,350
That?

3841
02:56:24,230 --> 02:56:25,190
You saw me?

3842
02:56:35,500 --> 02:56:36,060
Okay.

3843
02:56:43,940 --> 02:56:45,220
Okay, that...

3844
02:56:45,220 --> 02:56:46,240
That's not fair.

3845
02:56:49,340 --> 02:56:50,200
You know what?

3846
02:56:50,340 --> 02:56:51,200
Oh my god!

3847
02:56:57,880 --> 02:56:59,380
Okay, there's no way...

3848
02:56:59,380 --> 02:57:01,160
There's no way the AI saw me again.

3849
02:57:07,700 --> 02:57:09,000
The AI saw me.

3850
02:57:09,520 --> 02:57:10,420
Oh my god!

3851
02:57:10,480 --> 02:57:11,700
There was a medkit here!

3852
02:57:14,440 --> 02:57:15,220
That's fine.

3853
02:57:15,880 --> 02:57:16,480
They don't know.

3854
02:57:22,500 --> 02:57:23,560
They don't know.

3855
02:57:33,200 --> 02:57:34,740
Okay, that's pretty silly.

3856
02:57:36,080 --> 02:57:37,940
Let me just go around them.

3857
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:40,400
That's really silly.

3858
02:57:41,740 --> 02:57:43,800
Just gotta give them one backshot.

3859
02:57:45,580 --> 02:57:47,280
I just turned you around.

3860
02:57:48,620 --> 02:57:49,460
No!

3861
02:57:50,100 --> 02:57:50,740
That's right!

3862
02:57:51,180 --> 02:57:53,040
Now you're paralyzed forever!

3863
02:57:56,660 --> 02:57:58,140
That's okay, right?

3864
02:57:59,600 --> 02:58:00,440
Stupid!

3865
02:58:01,060 --> 02:58:02,580
Get you a fucking backshot!

3866
02:58:03,780 --> 02:58:04,440
That's right!

3867
02:58:06,100 --> 02:58:08,040
Shot him in the spine!

3868
02:58:11,280 --> 02:58:13,240
She knows too much!

3869
02:58:17,340 --> 02:58:18,380
That is...

3870
02:58:19,460 --> 02:58:20,840
That is so sad.

3871
02:58:23,780 --> 02:58:25,780
Oh my god, I hate...

3872
02:58:25,780 --> 02:58:26,460
Area up.

3873
02:58:27,640 --> 02:58:28,680
Area up.

3874
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:34,560
Jesus!

3875
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:37,040
Oh my god!

3876
02:58:37,240 --> 02:58:37,640
Fuck this.

3877
02:58:43,220 --> 02:58:45,040
Okay, I realized that was...

3878
02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:45,940
I got scared.

3879
02:58:45,940 --> 02:58:47,940
I thought that I accidentally did myself again.

3880
02:58:50,180 --> 02:58:51,580
That seems like something I do.

3881
02:58:54,440 --> 02:58:54,920
Okay.

3882
02:58:56,240 --> 02:58:58,640
Turkey's backshots will leave you paralyzed.

3883
02:59:00,340 --> 02:59:00,960
That's right!

3884
02:59:01,080 --> 02:59:02,240
You saw what I did to him?

3885
02:59:13,610 --> 02:59:15,430
Oh my god, this guy is so annoying.

3886
02:59:18,730 --> 02:59:20,570
Oh my god, this guy is so annoying.

3887
02:59:20,570 --> 02:59:20,810
I want...

3888
02:59:20,810 --> 02:59:21,630
Where's his other gun?

3889
02:59:23,210 --> 02:59:24,610
Okay, I don't want a needler.

3890
02:59:24,790 --> 02:59:25,570
I want...

3891
02:59:25,570 --> 02:59:25,930
There we go.

3892
02:59:28,050 --> 02:59:28,510
Alright.

3893
02:59:28,930 --> 02:59:29,570
Down I go.

3894
02:59:30,850 --> 02:59:32,670
Down, down I go.

3895
02:59:32,970 --> 02:59:33,090
Wait.

3896
02:59:33,410 --> 02:59:34,290
Oh wait, there you go.

3897
02:59:35,510 --> 02:59:36,290
What the fuck?

3898
02:59:36,570 --> 02:59:38,190
Oh, I was too busy meleeing!

3899
02:59:40,130 --> 02:59:41,290
That's right, I don't...

3900
02:59:41,290 --> 02:59:42,370
That's fucking right.

3901
02:59:43,590 --> 02:59:45,650
Wait, for my over health, do I like...

3902
02:59:45,650 --> 02:59:46,330
Can I like read?

3903
02:59:49,170 --> 02:59:49,830
What the fuck?

3904
02:59:49,970 --> 02:59:50,610
Okay, this is it.

3905
02:59:50,750 --> 02:59:51,170
That's it.

3906
02:59:51,330 --> 02:59:51,810
I'm tired.

3907
02:59:51,810 --> 02:59:54,130
Is my over health recharged right now?

3908
03:00:00,200 --> 03:00:01,280
That's fucking right.

3909
03:00:02,120 --> 03:00:03,220
Oh, it doesn't?

3910
03:00:03,420 --> 03:00:03,760
Aww.

3911
03:00:04,080 --> 03:00:04,340
It's okay.

3912
03:00:04,520 --> 03:00:05,880
There's like 20 more right here.

3913
03:00:08,240 --> 03:00:09,140
Wait, what?

3914
03:00:09,860 --> 03:00:10,420
Aww.

3915
03:00:11,060 --> 03:00:12,340
I can't take those?

3916
03:00:16,010 --> 03:00:16,570
Sucks.

3917
03:00:18,270 --> 03:00:19,790
Oh, this seems like a fight.

3918
03:00:20,990 --> 03:00:22,810
Yeah, this seems like a fight fight.

3919
03:00:27,780 --> 03:00:28,780
Oh wait, that's...

3920
03:00:29,500 --> 03:00:29,900
Whoops.

3921
03:00:38,060 --> 03:00:38,960
It's fine.

3922
03:00:39,220 --> 03:00:39,980
There's three more.

3923
03:00:42,020 --> 03:00:43,000
It's fine.

3924
03:00:43,340 --> 03:00:44,380
There's three more.

3925
03:00:52,210 --> 03:00:52,850
What?

3926
03:00:53,190 --> 03:00:54,070
That's a hit.

3927
03:00:54,750 --> 03:00:55,730
That was a hit.

3928
03:00:58,790 --> 03:00:59,430
Okay.

3929
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:00,470
It's fine.

3930
03:01:00,470 --> 03:01:01,230
I'll reset them.

3931
03:01:01,750 --> 03:01:02,970
They'll be like, oh, she's gone?

3932
03:01:04,130 --> 03:01:05,350
Joke's on you.

3933
03:01:07,390 --> 03:01:08,550
I'm still here.

3934
03:01:08,550 --> 03:01:08,670
Yeah.

3935
03:01:12,260 --> 03:01:13,040
What?

3936
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:15,480
That's not fair!

3937
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:16,380
Oh!

3938
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,160
I don't need a beta melee.

3939
03:01:30,090 --> 03:01:31,030
Oh no.

3940
03:01:34,500 --> 03:01:35,600
Here we go.

3941
03:01:38,450 --> 03:01:40,330
What if I just go...

3942
03:01:40,840 --> 03:01:41,930
Oh my god, you're right.

3943
03:01:41,930 --> 03:01:42,030
Wait.

3944
03:01:42,370 --> 03:01:42,730
Wait.

3945
03:01:48,250 --> 03:01:49,730
Oh my god, I'm off!

3946
03:01:52,710 --> 03:01:53,290
Here we go.

3947
03:01:55,130 --> 03:01:55,930
What the fuck?

3948
03:01:56,050 --> 03:01:57,450
I'm trying to bait the melee!

3949
03:01:58,630 --> 03:02:00,430
Guys, I don't think I know how to bait the melee.

3950
03:02:05,610 --> 03:02:06,430
Guys, I'll learn.

3951
03:02:06,670 --> 03:02:07,850
I learned, I swear to god.

3952
03:02:08,690 --> 03:02:09,370
I'll learn.

3953
03:02:09,810 --> 03:02:11,370
I'm trying to learn, guys.

3954
03:02:11,830 --> 03:02:12,350
I'm...

3955
03:02:15,810 --> 03:02:16,330
Guys.

3956
03:02:16,790 --> 03:02:18,110
I swear to god.

3957
03:02:18,270 --> 03:02:19,590
I'll understand it soon.

3958
03:02:20,110 --> 03:02:20,890
I'll swear to god.

3959
03:02:26,380 --> 03:02:27,240
Here we go.

3960
03:02:27,360 --> 03:02:28,020
I beat it out.

3961
03:02:32,660 --> 03:02:33,700
Two more.

3962
03:02:35,480 --> 03:02:36,000
Two...

3963
03:02:36,560 --> 03:02:37,580
Two more.

3964
03:02:41,420 --> 03:02:43,900
I told you I'll figure it out.

3965
03:02:46,360 --> 03:02:47,900
First try, guys.

3966
03:02:48,300 --> 03:02:49,080
First try.

3967
03:02:51,120 --> 03:02:52,420
I did it.

3968
03:02:52,740 --> 03:02:55,160
I'm so good at video games.

3969
03:02:57,380 --> 03:02:58,340
Where do I go?

3970
03:02:58,420 --> 03:02:58,560
Here?

3971
03:02:58,820 --> 03:02:59,460
Oh yeah, here.

3972
03:03:00,720 --> 03:03:01,520
Hello, everybody.

3973
03:03:03,320 --> 03:03:06,520
There's some dead by daylight shit there.

3974
03:03:13,220 --> 03:03:13,620
Okay.

3975
03:03:21,250 --> 03:03:21,650
Wait.

3976
03:03:22,410 --> 03:03:23,690
I don't like that.

3977
03:03:24,070 --> 03:03:25,210
We just...

3978
03:03:25,210 --> 03:03:27,350
He has a golden armor.

3979
03:03:27,750 --> 03:03:28,750
Guys, it's quiet.

3980
03:03:30,750 --> 03:03:31,550
It's quiet.

3981
03:03:31,550 --> 03:03:33,830
I don't like it when it's quiet, guys.

3982
03:03:35,250 --> 03:03:37,130
Why is it quiet?

3983
03:03:38,670 --> 03:03:39,850
Oh no.

3984
03:03:41,970 --> 03:03:42,930
Uh oh.

3985
03:03:43,630 --> 03:03:44,490
Uh oh.

3986
03:03:46,650 --> 03:03:47,830
Go back?

3987
03:03:49,410 --> 03:03:51,610
Guys, why does he have golden armor?

3988
03:03:52,650 --> 03:03:53,090
We're

3989
03:04:02,900 --> 03:04:03,540
on our way.

3990
03:04:03,700 --> 03:04:04,240
We're on our way.

3991
03:04:11,150 --> 03:04:11,830
Oh my god.

3992
03:04:12,070 --> 03:04:12,470
Oh my god.

3993
03:04:12,610 --> 03:04:12,850
I see you.

3994
03:04:12,990 --> 03:04:13,810
I see you.

3995
03:04:17,730 --> 03:04:18,830
I see you!

3996
03:04:23,050 --> 03:04:23,690
Where is he?

3997
03:04:26,330 --> 03:04:27,030
Oh my god.

3998
03:04:27,230 --> 03:04:28,250
This is fucked up.

3999
03:04:30,830 --> 03:04:32,990
This is fucked up because they're all invisible!

4000
03:04:32,990 --> 03:04:33,430
It's the fuck!

4001
03:04:41,710 --> 03:04:42,790
Oh my god.

4002
03:04:44,930 --> 03:04:46,190
It's not fair!

4003
03:04:47,470 --> 03:04:49,010
They're so fast!

4004
03:04:51,650 --> 03:04:52,590
What work?

4005
03:04:56,230 --> 03:04:57,190
What work?

4006
03:05:00,870 --> 03:05:02,530
I can one-shot them?

4007
03:05:02,810 --> 03:05:02,810
How?

4008
03:05:06,510 --> 03:05:07,290
Oh my god!

4009
03:05:07,410 --> 03:05:07,410
Oh my god!

4010
03:05:07,410 --> 03:05:08,270
He's just shooting me!

4011
03:05:09,350 --> 03:05:10,210
With a pistol?

4012
03:05:20,520 --> 03:05:22,300
Oh, a pistol can one-shot them?

4013
03:05:22,480 --> 03:05:23,380
But he has shields!

4014
03:05:23,800 --> 03:05:24,180
Doesn't he?

4015
03:05:25,220 --> 03:05:26,380
I thought he had shields.

4016
03:05:30,520 --> 03:05:31,260
Cold War.

4017
03:05:32,480 --> 03:05:32,920
Nice.

4018
03:05:36,960 --> 03:05:38,900
Alright, I don't think I can walk down.

4019
03:05:40,180 --> 03:05:41,720
I don't think I can jump down there.

4020
03:05:42,460 --> 03:05:44,020
You're bringing us some heavy weapons.

4021
03:05:44,260 --> 03:05:47,360
After I saw we were up against hunters, I thought you- Oh, they don't have shields?

4022
03:05:47,600 --> 03:05:47,800
Oh!

4023
03:05:49,120 --> 03:05:51,260
Okay, I'll know now to one-shot them.

4024
03:05:52,760 --> 03:05:53,900
Now I know, guys.

4025
03:06:00,020 --> 03:06:02,660
Guys, I know that- I know there's fall damage.

4026
03:06:02,820 --> 03:06:03,780
I tested it out.

4027
03:06:04,160 --> 03:06:09,080
I- I know there's fall damage.

4028
03:06:09,200 --> 03:06:10,340
You can't fuck with me.

4029
03:06:10,520 --> 03:06:12,680
We already tested it out.

4030
03:06:22,030 --> 03:06:26,950
I didn't- I gotta do a double tap because I don't trust myself.

4031
03:06:27,510 --> 03:06:28,270
Stop that.

4032
03:06:31,110 --> 03:06:34,470
I know- And you know, like, when the shield disappears, that's when they're dead.

4033
03:06:39,010 --> 03:06:39,690
Alright.

4034
03:06:39,690 --> 03:06:40,610
Let's go.

4035
03:06:41,710 --> 03:06:43,210
There's a bazooka somewhere?

4036
03:06:44,470 --> 03:06:45,450
Too late.

4037
03:06:46,170 --> 03:06:46,890
I already made mine.

4038
03:06:47,490 --> 03:06:48,470
Alright, I'm already committed.

4039
03:06:48,970 --> 03:06:49,830
Let's go downstairs.

4040
03:06:51,370 --> 03:06:51,870
Orp orp.

4041
03:06:53,830 --> 03:06:56,910
That was just a bug, Doki.

4042
03:06:56,910 --> 03:06:58,030
Trust me.

4043
03:06:59,990 --> 03:07:04,150
You see, if it was any other chat, I would trust you.

4044
03:07:05,070 --> 03:07:07,290
But you are my chat.

4045
03:07:13,630 --> 03:07:14,410
Alright.

4046
03:07:14,870 --> 03:07:16,610
Do we go back or is it left side?

4047
03:07:18,010 --> 03:07:18,790
Wow.

4048
03:07:25,940 --> 03:07:27,780
You don't trust us?

4049
03:07:27,920 --> 03:07:29,500
You don't even trust me!

4050
03:07:31,820 --> 03:07:32,600
What?

4051
03:07:32,600 --> 03:07:35,280
You guys don't even trust me!

4052
03:07:38,120 --> 03:07:39,560
Oh my god, okay.

4053
03:07:41,020 --> 03:07:42,740
I'll just shoot his dicks, I guess.

4054
03:07:46,160 --> 03:07:47,280
I'm scared.

4055
03:07:52,230 --> 03:07:53,190
God, fuck this.

4056
03:07:57,100 --> 03:07:57,920
There we go.

4057
03:08:01,580 --> 03:08:02,020
There we go.

4058
03:08:09,240 --> 03:08:10,140
There's a cat.

4059
03:08:10,740 --> 03:08:11,240
There we go.

4060
03:08:13,140 --> 03:08:13,900
Look at that guy.

4061
03:08:14,020 --> 03:08:15,420
What the fuck are these guys doing?

4062
03:08:17,760 --> 03:08:20,180
They're like, we were just watching.

4063
03:08:20,180 --> 03:08:20,360
Nick.

4064
03:08:25,680 --> 03:08:26,500
Oh, he's dead.

4065
03:08:28,520 --> 03:08:28,940
Tori.

4066
03:08:31,400 --> 03:08:32,380
Alright, here we go.

4067
03:08:33,600 --> 03:08:36,540
I'm just gonna... No, I don't waste my shield on this guy.

4068
03:08:36,760 --> 03:08:37,480
Get out of here.

4069
03:08:37,940 --> 03:08:38,840
Get out of here.

4070
03:08:38,960 --> 03:08:39,780
I know you're alive.

4071
03:08:41,500 --> 03:08:42,500
Get over here.

4072
03:08:50,440 --> 03:08:53,640
Doki, they were just chilling up on the cliff, Doki!

4073
03:08:54,780 --> 03:08:56,240
They're just hanging out!

4074
03:08:56,340 --> 03:08:57,280
It's a secret club!

4075
03:08:57,660 --> 03:08:59,160
No, no halos allowed!

4076
03:09:05,300 --> 03:09:07,240
Oh, it's my hill now.

4077
03:09:10,430 --> 03:09:11,770
My hill now.

4078
03:09:12,010 --> 03:09:13,350
I'm king of the hill now.

4079
03:09:15,770 --> 03:09:16,750
Oh, Bobby.

4080
03:09:21,370 --> 03:09:22,810
Oh no, my overshield.

4081
03:09:24,530 --> 03:09:25,290
Wait, what?

4082
03:09:28,410 --> 03:09:29,130
Here we go.

4083
03:09:30,270 --> 03:09:30,630
Wait, what?

4084
03:09:33,410 --> 03:09:34,410
That's fucking right.

4085
03:09:37,490 --> 03:09:38,430
Alright, let's go.

4086
03:09:42,990 --> 03:09:43,830
What was that?

4087
03:09:44,030 --> 03:09:44,470
Guys!

4088
03:09:44,710 --> 03:09:45,270
What was that?

4089
03:09:45,350 --> 03:09:46,530
Was that also a bug?

4090
03:09:49,650 --> 03:09:51,270
Fucking bugged my ass.

4091
03:09:52,970 --> 03:09:54,010
I literally...

4092
03:09:54,630 --> 03:09:55,150
Tripped...

4093
03:09:55,150 --> 03:09:56,110
Like...

4094
03:09:56,110 --> 03:09:56,790
10 centimeters.

4095
03:09:59,330 --> 03:10:00,370
It says...

4096
03:10:00,870 --> 03:10:01,270
Yes.

4097
03:10:01,750 --> 03:10:04,130
I tripped 10 centimeters, guys!

4098
03:10:04,450 --> 03:10:05,330
What was that?

4099
03:10:05,390 --> 03:10:05,650
Huh?

4100
03:10:06,050 --> 03:10:06,590
Oh, hey.

4101
03:10:06,750 --> 03:10:07,290
Rocket launcher.

4102
03:10:08,890 --> 03:10:10,330
How much bullet do I have?

4103
03:10:10,430 --> 03:10:10,970
Okay, five.

4104
03:10:11,190 --> 03:10:11,410
Okay.

4105
03:10:12,510 --> 03:10:13,390
Alright, nice.

4106
03:10:13,550 --> 03:10:14,070
Okay, I need it.

4107
03:10:14,330 --> 03:10:14,730
Oh, hey.

4108
03:10:14,870 --> 03:10:16,110
Oh, there's another warthog.

4109
03:10:16,610 --> 03:10:17,330
Aw, too bad.

4110
03:10:17,330 --> 03:10:19,590
Too bad my crew never showed up.

4111
03:10:21,130 --> 03:10:25,610
You still have overshield, so it's just a visual bug.

4112
03:10:26,310 --> 03:10:26,890
Oh, yeah.

4113
03:10:27,110 --> 03:10:31,390
That 10 centimeter jump I did was just a little bug.

4114
03:10:32,130 --> 03:10:33,290
Whoopsie doodle.

4115
03:10:38,490 --> 03:10:40,070
Where did my team go?

4116
03:10:42,070 --> 03:10:42,670
Where did my team go?

4117
03:10:42,670 --> 03:10:43,570
I guess it's like one more...

4118
03:10:45,070 --> 03:10:45,950
One more round.

4119
03:10:51,340 --> 03:10:52,300
Oh, there they are.

4120
03:10:58,940 --> 03:11:00,720
Okay, I need them to...

4121
03:11:00,720 --> 03:11:01,120
Come on.

4122
03:11:02,800 --> 03:11:03,280
Come on.

4123
03:11:03,720 --> 03:11:04,560
Here we go.

4124
03:11:06,820 --> 03:11:07,600
Is that them?

4125
03:11:15,840 --> 03:11:16,680
It's fine.

4126
03:11:16,700 --> 03:11:17,420
I'll go higher.

4127
03:11:20,590 --> 03:11:21,350
Oh, hey.

4128
03:11:22,270 --> 03:11:23,230
Got your leg.

4129
03:11:28,030 --> 03:11:29,690
Like, what's shooting me?

4130
03:11:32,390 --> 03:11:33,270
Who's that?

4131
03:11:36,030 --> 03:11:37,550
You think my crew is okay?

4132
03:11:41,950 --> 03:11:43,750
You guys, you think they're okay?

4133
03:11:43,750 --> 03:11:46,050
It's been a while since I last saw them.

4134
03:11:52,430 --> 03:11:53,810
I need them to...

4135
03:11:55,970 --> 03:11:56,750
Come on.

4136
03:11:58,990 --> 03:12:00,190
Get a little closer.

4137
03:12:01,150 --> 03:12:01,890
Come on.

4138
03:12:02,030 --> 03:12:02,310
I can...

4139
03:12:02,310 --> 03:12:03,530
I can poke you forever.

4140
03:12:03,690 --> 03:12:04,790
There's no falloff damage.

4141
03:12:05,550 --> 03:12:08,050
He's going up the hill?!

4142
03:12:10,170 --> 03:12:12,050
Okay, that guy is actually a pussy.

4143
03:12:12,230 --> 03:12:13,250
Alright, give me a sec.

4144
03:12:13,350 --> 03:12:13,790
Let me...

4145
03:12:13,790 --> 03:12:15,190
Let me grab my warthog.

4146
03:12:16,070 --> 03:12:16,870
Give me...

4147
03:12:18,210 --> 03:12:20,270
Oh, now you're gonna come down!

4148
03:12:20,790 --> 03:12:22,530
Oh, and then you're gonna go back up the hill.

4149
03:12:22,690 --> 03:12:24,090
Alright, let me grab...

4150
03:12:28,430 --> 03:12:30,010
Alright, I swear to God.

4151
03:12:30,490 --> 03:12:30,930
Oh, yeah.

4152
03:12:31,210 --> 03:12:32,610
Okay, I swear to God.

4153
03:12:32,830 --> 03:12:34,850
Every time I shoot, he goes back up the hill.

4154
03:12:34,850 --> 03:12:35,390
Alright.

4155
03:12:39,600 --> 03:12:41,480
Falloff damage is basically...

4156
03:12:41,480 --> 03:12:43,220
The further the bullet goes...

4157
03:12:44,020 --> 03:12:46,120
The less damage it does.

4158
03:12:47,100 --> 03:12:48,240
Alright, get over here.

4159
03:12:48,320 --> 03:12:49,040
I see you now.

4160
03:12:50,340 --> 03:12:52,120
Stop running up the hill!

4161
03:12:57,220 --> 03:12:58,420
Get over here.

4162
03:13:02,930 --> 03:13:03,660
Fucking idiot.

4163
03:13:03,840 --> 03:13:04,340
Was that worth it?

4164
03:13:04,440 --> 03:13:05,420
Was that worth it?!

4165
03:13:05,420 --> 03:13:06,840
Was that worth it?!

4166
03:13:07,820 --> 03:13:09,380
Was it worth it?!

4167
03:13:15,520 --> 03:13:19,660
I'm not gonna use my rocket launcher on one eye!

4168
03:13:20,060 --> 03:13:20,940
I'm not!

4169
03:13:25,040 --> 03:13:26,200
Okay, see, I told you.

4170
03:13:26,340 --> 03:13:26,720
They're alive.

4171
03:13:27,080 --> 03:13:27,800
See, I told you guys.

4172
03:13:30,480 --> 03:13:31,100
There you go.

4173
03:13:33,920 --> 03:13:35,280
Okay, they were alive.

4174
03:13:40,320 --> 03:13:41,580
Okay, they were...

4175
03:13:42,320 --> 03:13:42,780
Oh...

4176
03:13:51,420 --> 03:13:51,880
Okay.

4177
03:13:53,480 --> 03:13:54,400
Alright, it's fine.

4178
03:13:59,540 --> 03:14:00,240
It's fine.

4179
03:14:06,730 --> 03:14:07,650
Are you serious?

4180
03:14:08,570 --> 03:14:09,030
No!

4181
03:14:10,870 --> 03:14:12,050
Let me shoot you in the back!

4182
03:14:12,210 --> 03:14:13,010
Let me shoot you in the back!

4183
03:14:13,130 --> 03:14:14,030
Let me shoot you in the back!

4184
03:14:15,290 --> 03:14:15,830
Come on!

4185
03:14:16,090 --> 03:14:16,570
Come on!

4186
03:14:20,020 --> 03:14:20,480
Nice.

4187
03:14:21,200 --> 03:14:22,060
There we go.

4188
03:14:22,380 --> 03:14:22,760
There we go.

4189
03:14:22,900 --> 03:14:23,300
I got it.

4190
03:14:23,400 --> 03:14:24,200
I figured it out.

4191
03:14:26,180 --> 03:14:27,320
Guys, look at that.

4192
03:14:27,660 --> 03:14:28,520
I'm halo-ing.

4193
03:14:30,220 --> 03:14:31,220
Look at that.

4194
03:14:31,760 --> 03:14:32,720
Backshot Doki.

4195
03:14:32,960 --> 03:14:33,560
Reign Supreme.

4196
03:14:34,320 --> 03:14:36,760
No one survives a Doki backshot.

4197
03:14:39,680 --> 03:14:41,560
Wait, my rocket launcher!

4198
03:14:41,560 --> 03:14:49,820
Wait, what are you- I thought- I threw- I thought what you guys were yelling at me about my rocket launcher.

4199
03:14:49,920 --> 03:14:52,920
I thought you were talking about- Alright, give me a sec.

4200
03:14:53,840 --> 03:14:55,020
Is that fucker's fault?

4201
03:14:55,760 --> 03:14:56,720
It's his fault.

4202
03:14:59,460 --> 03:15:00,760
Where did I leave it?

4203
03:15:00,960 --> 03:15:03,380
Oh my god, where did I leave-

4204
03:15:07,100 --> 03:15:07,580
Alright.

4205
03:15:10,440 --> 03:15:12,980
I think it was like all the way back there.

4206
03:15:17,370 --> 03:15:18,550
I'm pretty sure.

4207
03:15:19,510 --> 03:15:21,810
It was wherever the fuck I parked my car.

4208
03:15:25,150 --> 03:15:25,930
Wait, what?

4209
03:15:26,310 --> 03:15:27,810
It can de-spawn?!

4210
03:15:30,390 --> 03:15:31,390
I passed it.

4211
03:15:31,490 --> 03:15:31,570
Oh.

4212
03:15:31,750 --> 03:15:32,390
Oh, I see it.

4213
03:15:32,470 --> 03:15:32,790
I see it.

4214
03:15:32,970 --> 03:15:34,590
Oh my god, you guys actually fucking scared me there.

4215
03:15:35,070 --> 03:15:35,550
There we go.

4216
03:15:36,470 --> 03:15:38,150
Alright, we're bringing the car in too.

4217
03:15:39,810 --> 03:15:40,390
Thank god.

4218
03:15:40,730 --> 03:15:43,390
Guys, I- I almost believed you there.

4219
03:15:44,630 --> 03:15:46,710
I was this close to believing in you.

4220
03:15:47,390 --> 03:15:49,290
See, this is what I meant, guys!

4221
03:15:49,690 --> 03:15:50,570
What I said!

4222
03:15:51,190 --> 03:15:53,970
If it was any other chat, I would believe them.

4223
03:15:54,370 --> 03:15:58,030
If it- This is what I mean!

4224
03:16:03,770 --> 03:16:04,690
Alright.

4225
03:16:08,980 --> 03:16:11,280
You almost trusted us.

4226
03:16:11,440 --> 03:16:12,100
Close call!

4227
03:16:15,420 --> 03:16:16,340
Alright.

4228
03:16:18,160 --> 03:16:20,100
Now I'm playing Halo.

4229
03:16:21,260 --> 03:16:22,900
Low and steady, guys.

4230
03:16:24,560 --> 03:16:26,120
Low and steady.

4231
03:16:26,120 --> 03:16:26,700
Ooh!

4232
03:16:29,860 --> 03:16:30,780
Hey, guys.

4233
03:16:32,020 --> 03:16:34,180
Wait, can I put my Warthog through this?

4234
03:16:37,500 --> 03:16:38,020
Oh!

4235
03:16:38,300 --> 03:16:41,060
Is that how I would've, like, skipped half the mission?

4236
03:16:41,060 --> 03:16:44,160
I jammed my Warthog into that and the door couldn't close?

4237
03:16:44,600 --> 03:16:45,600
Is that it?

4238
03:16:46,060 --> 03:16:46,520
Oh, hey.

4239
03:16:46,520 --> 03:16:47,020
Hey, cutscene.

4240
03:17:08,560 --> 03:17:09,760
Go for the guy?

4241
03:17:10,140 --> 03:17:10,600
Okay.

4242
03:17:18,560 --> 03:17:20,300
Wait, there's health packs over there.

4243
03:17:23,640 --> 03:17:24,960
Wait, I hear something.

4244
03:17:31,180 --> 03:17:32,360
Wait, what the fuck?

4245
03:17:32,540 --> 03:17:33,680
That was on his head!

4246
03:17:35,600 --> 03:17:37,460
That was nearly on his head!

4247
03:17:40,040 --> 03:17:40,980
There we go.

4248
03:17:40,980 --> 03:17:41,040
There we go.

4249
03:17:43,920 --> 03:17:46,520
I'm not rocket jumping that!

4250
03:17:51,860 --> 03:17:53,040
Oh, my God.

4251
03:18:03,260 --> 03:18:04,520
Okay, let me kill him.

4252
03:18:09,360 --> 03:18:10,720
I hate this guy.

4253
03:18:13,860 --> 03:18:15,100
I should kill him.

4254
03:18:16,580 --> 03:18:17,460
Wait, what?

4255
03:18:17,600 --> 03:18:18,240
He's not there?

4256
03:18:18,980 --> 03:18:20,420
When did he get over there?

4257
03:18:20,800 --> 03:18:21,280
Alright.

4258
03:18:33,130 --> 03:18:35,210
I fucking kill him.

4259
03:18:36,710 --> 03:18:38,370
I fucking kill him.

4260
03:18:38,850 --> 03:18:40,950
I fucking kill him.

4261
03:18:41,210 --> 03:18:42,170
I fucking kill him.

4262
03:18:42,370 --> 03:18:43,110
Okay.

4263
03:18:43,890 --> 03:18:45,530
Oh, you gotta jump.

4264
03:18:46,450 --> 03:18:47,210
Okay.

4265
03:18:55,260 --> 03:18:57,160
I fucking hate you.

4266
03:18:59,260 --> 03:19:01,160
Oh, you're right.

4267
03:19:01,560 --> 03:19:04,200
I just needed more overshield.

4268
03:19:04,480 --> 03:19:05,940
Oh, you're so right, guys.

4269
03:19:05,940 --> 03:19:07,560
You're so fucking right.

4270
03:19:07,740 --> 03:19:11,260
If only I had more overshield, guys.

4271
03:19:11,480 --> 03:19:12,320
If only...

4272
03:19:19,260 --> 03:19:20,960
If only, guys.

4273
03:19:21,420 --> 03:19:22,520
Oh, my God.

4274
03:19:22,800 --> 03:19:26,780
My lack of overshield surely fucked me over.

4275
03:19:29,720 --> 03:19:32,780
That was a real bug, Toki.

4276
03:19:36,880 --> 03:19:37,400
Wait.

4277
03:19:37,560 --> 03:19:38,020
Where did he go?

4278
03:19:40,800 --> 03:19:41,980
He's like, over there.

4279
03:19:48,030 --> 03:19:49,250
I don't know how fucked this.

4280
03:19:50,570 --> 03:19:51,870
What the fuck that?

4281
03:19:55,970 --> 03:19:57,130
Oh, this sucks, though.

4282
03:19:57,230 --> 03:19:58,110
Cause it's like...

4283
03:20:00,030 --> 03:20:01,010
Cause it's like...

4284
03:20:01,010 --> 03:20:02,930
I only have very limited rocket ammo.

4285
03:20:03,690 --> 03:20:04,650
I wanna...

4286
03:20:04,650 --> 03:20:05,050
I wanna...

4287
03:20:05,050 --> 03:20:05,710
I'd rather save it.

4288
03:20:12,260 --> 03:20:12,900
Wait.

4289
03:20:13,180 --> 03:20:13,300
Oh.

4290
03:20:13,540 --> 03:20:13,860
Nice.

4291
03:20:19,420 --> 03:20:20,020
Alright.

4292
03:20:23,010 --> 03:20:23,650
Come on.

4293
03:20:24,410 --> 03:20:25,070
Get over here.

4294
03:20:26,470 --> 03:20:27,610
That's fuck you, right?

4295
03:20:29,710 --> 03:20:31,610
Yeah, but like...

4296
03:20:31,610 --> 03:20:32,670
When will I...

4297
03:20:32,670 --> 03:20:33,810
I have like...

4298
03:20:33,810 --> 03:20:34,670
Seven...

4299
03:20:34,670 --> 03:20:35,710
I have like...

4300
03:20:35,710 --> 03:20:36,550
Six ammo.

4301
03:20:41,000 --> 03:20:42,300
Read the...

4302
03:20:42,300 --> 03:20:42,760
Toki.

4303
03:20:42,940 --> 03:20:47,260
Just read the side of the rocket launcher while it's on the...

4304
03:20:48,680 --> 03:20:49,240
Yeah.

4305
03:20:49,480 --> 03:20:49,860
Yeah.

4306
03:20:54,990 --> 03:20:56,650
I wanna use it for like...

4307
03:20:56,650 --> 03:20:57,250
The strong...

4308
03:20:57,250 --> 03:20:57,810
Oh, my God.

4309
03:20:58,050 --> 03:20:58,790
Okay, sorry.

4310
03:20:58,910 --> 03:20:59,330
Not him.

4311
03:20:59,950 --> 03:21:00,510
He...

4312
03:21:01,790 --> 03:21:02,890
Not that...

4313
03:21:02,890 --> 03:21:03,310
That guy.

4314
03:21:03,590 --> 03:21:04,390
But like...

4315
03:21:04,390 --> 03:21:05,150
I meant like...

4316
03:21:05,150 --> 03:21:06,270
The guy with the gold...

4317
03:21:06,270 --> 03:21:07,130
The gold guy.

4318
03:21:07,630 --> 03:21:08,030
I...

4319
03:21:08,030 --> 03:21:08,690
That guy.

4320
03:21:08,830 --> 03:21:10,370
Look, he scared me, okay?

4321
03:21:10,790 --> 03:21:11,990
I got scared.

4322
03:21:15,930 --> 03:21:18,130
I'm gonna save this for the gold man.

4323
03:21:24,640 --> 03:21:25,140
Okay.

4324
03:21:30,250 --> 03:21:31,130
Jesus Christ.

4325
03:21:31,410 --> 03:21:32,170
That's the overkill.

4326
03:21:32,370 --> 03:21:33,330
That's overkill.

4327
03:21:39,010 --> 03:21:39,510
What?

4328
03:21:41,510 --> 03:21:42,730
Where's he trying to walk to?

4329
03:21:43,950 --> 03:21:45,410
Where the fuck is the hunter?

4330
03:21:46,830 --> 03:21:47,670
Guys, I'm scared.

4331
03:21:47,810 --> 03:21:49,030
Where the fuck is the hunter?

4332
03:21:50,950 --> 03:21:51,770
He doesn't know.

4333
03:21:54,970 --> 03:21:55,690
What can he do?

4334
03:21:58,530 --> 03:21:59,310
There you go.

4335
03:21:59,470 --> 03:21:59,890
Wait, what?

4336
03:22:01,030 --> 03:22:01,590
I...

4337
03:22:01,590 --> 03:22:02,210
Like, hit you.

4338
03:22:08,330 --> 03:22:08,890
My...

4339
03:22:08,890 --> 03:22:09,990
Turn around.

4340
03:22:10,470 --> 03:22:10,930
Come on.

4341
03:22:11,050 --> 03:22:11,410
Turn around.

4342
03:22:12,030 --> 03:22:12,710
Come on.

4343
03:22:12,810 --> 03:22:13,530
Turn around.

4344
03:22:19,230 --> 03:22:20,350
Turn around.

4345
03:22:22,270 --> 03:22:23,730
I can just...

4346
03:22:25,270 --> 03:22:26,110
There we go.

4347
03:22:26,750 --> 03:22:27,410
Shot your back.

4348
03:22:30,170 --> 03:22:32,010
Alright, this guy will turn around, right?

4349
03:22:33,010 --> 03:22:34,050
Do you see me?

4350
03:22:42,080 --> 03:22:42,820
Hey.

4351
03:22:44,320 --> 03:22:45,060
Hey.

4352
03:22:45,540 --> 03:22:46,020
WHOA!

4353
03:22:49,300 --> 03:22:50,040
WHOA!

4354
03:22:50,820 --> 03:22:51,560
WHOA!

4355
03:22:51,720 --> 03:22:53,060
Well there, buddy.

4356
03:22:59,720 --> 03:23:00,860
Nice try.

4357
03:23:01,340 --> 03:23:02,080
Nice try.

4358
03:23:04,680 --> 03:23:05,620
Nice try, buddy.

4359
03:23:07,640 --> 03:23:08,360
Nice one.

4360
03:23:09,920 --> 03:23:10,040
Nice.

4361
03:23:12,540 --> 03:23:13,820
What do I... Oh, wait.

4362
03:23:14,220 --> 03:23:14,920
Oh, wait here.

4363
03:23:15,080 --> 03:23:16,520
Oh, wait, this is where I...

4364
03:23:17,060 --> 03:23:21,140
Oh, this is the area I saw where I should have rocket jumped, right?

4365
03:23:22,020 --> 03:23:24,360
This guy, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

4366
03:23:24,880 --> 03:23:27,820
It really was one of the scariest games of the year when it was released.

4367
03:23:28,160 --> 03:23:30,180
I rated it to be as scary as FNAF.

4368
03:23:30,680 --> 03:23:31,080
Really?

4369
03:23:31,760 --> 03:23:34,460
Oh, this guy, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

4370
03:23:36,900 --> 03:23:40,020
No, this is where you rocket jump, right here.

4371
03:23:41,900 --> 03:23:42,880
Oh, it's over here.

4372
03:23:44,060 --> 03:23:45,540
I have too much power now.

4373
03:23:46,060 --> 03:23:47,340
I know the strats.

4374
03:23:47,520 --> 03:23:48,300
I'm John Halo.

4375
03:23:49,180 --> 03:23:52,060
I'm gonna find that Halo and become the John Halo.

4376
03:23:55,540 --> 03:23:57,460
Oh, this feels like a fight.

4377
03:24:00,780 --> 03:24:02,240
This feels like a fight fight.

4378
03:24:17,020 --> 03:24:18,100
Oh, there they are.

4379
03:24:18,240 --> 03:24:21,760
We'll be in a tight spot if we don't get out of here before additional reinforcements arrive.

4380
03:24:22,080 --> 03:24:23,020
Let's find that map.

4381
03:24:27,970 --> 03:24:28,490
Um...

4382
03:24:28,490 --> 03:24:29,510
We don't like this.

4383
03:24:30,790 --> 03:24:31,950
We don't like this.

4384
03:24:36,190 --> 03:24:36,710
Oh...

4385
03:24:36,710 --> 03:24:38,490
I don't like this.

4386
03:24:42,500 --> 03:24:43,020
Hello?

4387
03:24:45,320 --> 03:24:45,840
Hello?

4388
03:24:50,830 --> 03:24:51,690
Where go?

4389
03:24:51,970 --> 03:24:52,310
Oh, there.

4390
03:24:52,550 --> 03:24:53,210
There's door.

4391
03:24:54,630 --> 03:24:55,550
Must be this door.

4392
03:24:56,950 --> 03:24:57,910
We go down.

4393
03:24:58,650 --> 03:24:59,590
Down is up.

4394
03:25:04,150 --> 03:25:05,670
You survived a headshot?

4395
03:25:06,950 --> 03:25:07,910
Okay, that...

4396
03:25:07,910 --> 03:25:09,190
Okay, no, that's a tart shot.

4397
03:25:10,210 --> 03:25:11,150
That wasn't a...

4398
03:25:11,150 --> 03:25:12,610
That wasn't not a headshot.

4399
03:25:14,330 --> 03:25:15,410
Oh, hey guys.

4400
03:25:15,930 --> 03:25:16,970
Oh, hey guys.

4401
03:25:17,110 --> 03:25:19,110
Oh, hey guys.

4402
03:25:20,270 --> 03:25:21,910
Sorry, I keep shooting you in the chest.

4403
03:25:22,110 --> 03:25:22,890
I couldn't help it.

4404
03:25:25,810 --> 03:25:27,090
Fuck, it's the big boys.

4405
03:25:29,050 --> 03:25:29,830
Where are they?

4406
03:25:32,470 --> 03:25:33,190
That's me.

4407
03:25:36,490 --> 03:25:37,090
That's me.

4408
03:25:37,190 --> 03:25:37,550
I'm enemy.

4409
03:25:40,730 --> 03:25:41,850
I hear him.

4410
03:25:42,990 --> 03:25:43,850
Is that him?

4411
03:25:44,090 --> 03:25:44,970
No, okay.

4412
03:25:46,530 --> 03:25:47,530
I gotta...

4413
03:25:47,530 --> 03:25:48,850
I gotta be sure.

4414
03:25:50,630 --> 03:25:51,350
What the fuck?

4415
03:25:51,450 --> 03:25:52,350
Where did that guy go?

4416
03:25:53,570 --> 03:25:55,130
Where did that other guy go?

4417
03:25:57,810 --> 03:25:58,930
Oh, there he is.

4418
03:26:01,750 --> 03:26:02,430
Oh, wait.

4419
03:26:02,490 --> 03:26:03,430
He just walked backwards.

4420
03:26:04,910 --> 03:26:07,010
He just slowly walked backwards.

4421
03:26:07,890 --> 03:26:08,410
Cheater.

4422
03:26:08,790 --> 03:26:10,290
Okay, it's not my fault.

4423
03:26:10,470 --> 03:26:11,790
I'm fucking blinding this map.

4424
03:26:14,150 --> 03:26:15,330
I have to be sure.

4425
03:26:19,830 --> 03:26:20,670
There you go.

4426
03:26:21,990 --> 03:26:22,990
Get back my...

4427
03:26:22,990 --> 03:26:23,870
Rocky launcher.

4428
03:26:28,420 --> 03:26:28,860
Nice.

4429
03:26:31,940 --> 03:26:32,680
Yeah, Toki.

4430
03:26:32,760 --> 03:26:35,040
Now you have enough to do the rocket jump, Toki.

4431
03:26:35,240 --> 03:26:36,220
Do it right here.

4432
03:26:45,660 --> 03:26:47,160
Yeah, but this gun's better.

4433
03:26:47,600 --> 03:26:48,320
Isn't it?

4434
03:26:48,680 --> 03:26:49,560
This gun's always better.

4435
03:26:50,800 --> 03:26:52,740
I hear, like, some guy going...

4436
03:26:53,320 --> 03:26:53,540
Whoa!

4437
03:26:55,860 --> 03:26:56,640
What, what?

4438
03:26:59,600 --> 03:27:00,240
We're...

4439
03:27:00,240 --> 03:27:01,220
I'm a little lost.

4440
03:27:02,180 --> 03:27:03,120
Above me?

4441
03:27:03,380 --> 03:27:05,320
Where is that sound coming from?

4442
03:27:06,600 --> 03:27:08,080
I came from here!

4443
03:27:10,780 --> 03:27:11,420
Right?

4444
03:27:12,440 --> 03:27:13,400
Oh, there it is.

4445
03:27:15,200 --> 03:27:16,260
Down is up.

4446
03:27:19,260 --> 03:27:20,160
There we go.

4447
03:27:21,120 --> 03:27:22,120
There's a down.

4448
03:27:28,480 --> 03:27:29,500
There we go.

4449
03:27:31,540 --> 03:27:32,240
Pick me!

4450
03:27:33,120 --> 03:27:34,260
I know you're there!

4451
03:27:37,720 --> 03:27:38,580
There we go.

4452
03:27:38,580 --> 03:27:40,640
Oh wait, he didn't hit the sh...

4453
03:27:40,640 --> 03:27:40,980
Aw.

4454
03:27:44,920 --> 03:27:45,920
Here we go.

4455
03:27:48,140 --> 03:27:49,000
Oh my god.

4456
03:27:49,380 --> 03:27:49,840
Oh my god.

4457
03:27:50,620 --> 03:27:51,480
Let me bail you!

4458
03:27:51,840 --> 03:27:52,380
My fucking...

4459
03:27:57,760 --> 03:27:59,120
My overshield.

4460
03:28:00,160 --> 03:28:01,540
Oh my god.

4461
03:28:01,720 --> 03:28:03,580
He dodged every melee.

4462
03:28:03,800 --> 03:28:04,460
That's crazy.

4463
03:28:05,120 --> 03:28:06,100
Holy fuck.

4464
03:28:06,100 --> 03:28:08,620
That guy was gaming.

4465
03:28:10,380 --> 03:28:12,540
He got some moves.

4466
03:28:12,940 --> 03:28:13,900
Located there.

4467
03:28:14,300 --> 03:28:17,240
That structure appears to be some sort of temple or shrine.

4468
03:28:17,240 --> 03:28:19,380
Like, let me backshot you!

4469
03:28:22,830 --> 03:28:26,160
A shrine is an unlikely place to put such a significant...

4470
03:28:26,160 --> 03:28:26,460
Alright.

4471
03:28:36,350 --> 03:28:37,170
Oh no.

4472
03:28:37,630 --> 03:28:38,290
Where did he go?

4473
03:28:38,470 --> 03:28:38,890
Keep trying.

4474
03:28:39,170 --> 03:28:42,250
Let me know when you reestablish contact, and then tell...

4475
03:28:48,210 --> 03:28:49,190
Where do we go now?

4476
03:28:50,010 --> 03:28:50,370
Affirmative.

4477
03:28:50,530 --> 03:28:51,130
Phone hammer.

4478
03:28:54,510 --> 03:28:56,670
Am I supposed to...

4479
03:28:57,170 --> 03:28:57,850
What do I do now?

4480
03:28:57,890 --> 03:28:58,690
Do I go back up?

4481
03:28:58,850 --> 03:28:59,110
Oh.

4482
03:28:59,990 --> 03:29:00,350
Okay.

4483
03:29:00,710 --> 03:29:02,230
Because I found the location, right?

4484
03:29:02,410 --> 03:29:02,770
Okay.

4485
03:29:03,310 --> 03:29:04,130
I was like thinking about it.

4486
03:29:04,190 --> 03:29:05,230
I was like, oh I found the location.

4487
03:29:05,350 --> 03:29:05,930
Do I just leave?

4488
03:29:07,030 --> 03:29:07,670
Leave, right?

4489
03:29:07,950 --> 03:29:08,330
Oh hey!

4490
03:29:10,450 --> 03:29:10,890
The fuck?

4491
03:29:12,150 --> 03:29:12,830
Oh nice.

4492
03:29:13,190 --> 03:29:14,530
I was like, what the fuck is that?

4493
03:29:16,410 --> 03:29:16,810
Huh.

4494
03:29:17,390 --> 03:29:17,770
I know.

4495
03:29:18,310 --> 03:29:19,230
Down is up.

4496
03:29:19,390 --> 03:29:20,610
Now up is down.

4497
03:29:24,730 --> 03:29:25,390
Okay, no.

4498
03:29:25,570 --> 03:29:25,650
Okay.

4499
03:29:25,910 --> 03:29:26,890
I thought it was...

4500
03:29:26,890 --> 03:29:28,330
I thought it was a natural threat.

4501
03:29:32,700 --> 03:29:33,100
Okay.

4502
03:29:33,180 --> 03:29:34,420
Give me a sec right here.

4503
03:29:34,640 --> 03:29:35,600
Wait, how do I get back up?

4504
03:29:37,620 --> 03:29:39,660
I said down is up, but like...

4505
03:29:40,320 --> 03:29:41,400
Wait, where's the stairs?

4506
03:29:43,880 --> 03:29:45,440
Where do the stairs go?

4507
03:29:47,740 --> 03:29:48,680
Ba-bum.

4508
03:29:49,640 --> 03:29:50,720
Ba-ba-dum.

4509
03:29:52,720 --> 03:29:54,600
Did I not come up from here?

4510
03:30:00,240 --> 03:30:01,160
What's it here?

4511
03:30:02,100 --> 03:30:03,560
Where the fuck did I come from?

4512
03:30:04,660 --> 03:30:05,840
Oh, the ramp!

4513
03:30:06,580 --> 03:30:07,200
Oh, I'm dumb.

4514
03:30:08,760 --> 03:30:11,720
It's like such hype music, but I was still stuck down here.

4515
03:30:12,480 --> 03:30:13,960
I was still stuck.

4516
03:30:15,100 --> 03:30:16,800
The music was for nothing.

4517
03:30:17,140 --> 03:30:18,760
I didn't know where I was.

4518
03:30:18,940 --> 03:30:21,440
I didn't know where I was.

4519
03:30:27,740 --> 03:30:28,580
Oh my god.

4520
03:30:28,700 --> 03:30:29,380
I thought I was gonna fall.

4521
03:30:30,640 --> 03:30:31,260
Oh no.

4522
03:30:36,000 --> 03:30:36,560
Come on.

4523
03:30:45,880 --> 03:30:47,200
God, you're so lucky.

4524
03:30:47,320 --> 03:30:48,080
You're so lucky!

4525
03:30:49,060 --> 03:30:50,860
I only have a pistol!

4526
03:30:53,300 --> 03:30:54,380
Fuck this guy.

4527
03:30:55,600 --> 03:30:56,360
That's right.

4528
03:30:58,000 --> 03:30:59,040
That's fucking right!

4529
03:30:59,600 --> 03:31:00,460
Okay, I need it.

4530
03:31:03,300 --> 03:31:04,080
Alright, there we go.

4531
03:31:05,360 --> 03:31:06,080
There we go.

4532
03:31:06,320 --> 03:31:06,920
That's more like it.

4533
03:31:09,200 --> 03:31:10,900
Wait, I hear somebody next to me.

4534
03:31:12,100 --> 03:31:12,540
Where?

4535
03:31:13,620 --> 03:31:14,880
Who's shooting next to me?

4536
03:31:16,200 --> 03:31:17,720
Someone's shooting me next to me.

4537
03:31:19,500 --> 03:31:20,180
Five.

4538
03:31:20,540 --> 03:31:20,980
Five.

4539
03:31:24,060 --> 03:31:24,740
Five.

4540
03:31:24,740 --> 03:31:24,960
Fuck butter.

4541
03:31:26,180 --> 03:31:27,660
Oh my god!

4542
03:31:28,140 --> 03:31:28,280
You!

4543
03:31:37,400 --> 03:31:38,220
That's it.

4544
03:31:43,120 --> 03:31:44,080
Oh my god.

4545
03:31:44,800 --> 03:31:45,900
Get out of here.

4546
03:31:46,340 --> 03:31:47,480
Get out of here!

4547
03:31:49,340 --> 03:31:51,920
I didn't realize I needed to look up!

4548
03:31:56,110 --> 03:31:57,590
How many bullets do I have left?

4549
03:31:57,730 --> 03:31:58,470
Oh, not a lot.

4550
03:32:00,470 --> 03:32:01,890
Not much left.

4551
03:32:06,650 --> 03:32:07,410
Oh wait.

4552
03:32:08,590 --> 03:32:09,750
I knew you weren't dead.

4553
03:32:09,890 --> 03:32:10,490
I knew it!

4554
03:32:10,490 --> 03:32:12,470
I know when dead is dead.

4555
03:32:18,850 --> 03:32:19,590
Beat me!

4556
03:32:26,090 --> 03:32:27,950
Get your shield out of the way!

4557
03:32:28,630 --> 03:32:29,350
What, what?

4558
03:32:33,000 --> 03:32:34,220
It's just you!

4559
03:32:34,680 --> 03:32:35,260
Wait, what?

4560
03:32:35,340 --> 03:32:35,760
Who's that?

4561
03:32:36,640 --> 03:32:37,440
Okay, that's nothing.

4562
03:32:37,660 --> 03:32:38,440
I'm just paranoid.

4563
03:32:43,150 --> 03:32:44,990
Alright, I'm slowly heading over.

4564
03:32:46,970 --> 03:32:48,850
I'm slowly heading over!

4565
03:32:52,720 --> 03:32:53,640
That's right!

4566
03:32:56,910 --> 03:32:58,630
Oh my god, that's it!

4567
03:33:02,260 --> 03:33:03,160
That's it!

4568
03:33:04,100 --> 03:33:05,360
Get over here!

4569
03:33:14,670 --> 03:33:16,530
Still have my rocket launcher.

4570
03:33:19,530 --> 03:33:20,950
I'm ward warding now.

4571
03:33:26,720 --> 03:33:27,500
Where are they?

4572
03:33:28,100 --> 03:33:28,440
Woah!

4573
03:33:30,660 --> 03:33:31,860
Fuck this guy.

4574
03:33:35,240 --> 03:33:36,360
Oh, did he actually?

4575
03:33:36,560 --> 03:33:38,220
Oh no, he just walked backwards.

4576
03:33:38,620 --> 03:33:40,960
I was gonna say, oh my god, he actually fell down!

4577
03:33:41,680 --> 03:33:42,300
Fucking idiot.

4578
03:33:44,080 --> 03:33:45,940
I gotta make sure I don't fall down.

4579
03:33:46,360 --> 03:33:47,760
That I be the fucking idiot.

4580
03:33:50,420 --> 03:33:52,200
Okay, just in case...

4581
03:33:53,060 --> 03:33:54,400
Just in case something...

4582
03:33:55,220 --> 03:33:56,480
Oh no, okay, it's not him.

4583
03:33:58,680 --> 03:33:59,740
Okay, I thought...

4584
03:33:59,740 --> 03:34:00,700
It wasn't like...

4585
03:34:00,700 --> 03:34:02,680
I was worried that it was the golden armor guy.

4586
03:34:03,140 --> 03:34:04,760
Those are the ones I'm worried about.

4587
03:34:08,400 --> 03:34:09,200
Fuck this.

4588
03:34:11,320 --> 03:34:11,960
Worth it.

4589
03:34:14,640 --> 03:34:15,460
Worth it.

4590
03:34:18,180 --> 03:34:19,180
Get out of here.

4591
03:34:22,320 --> 03:34:22,880
Alright.

4592
03:34:23,620 --> 03:34:25,160
I got one med kit.

4593
03:34:30,070 --> 03:34:31,850
Guys, it will be worth it.

4594
03:34:31,970 --> 03:34:33,290
Me saving those...

4595
03:34:33,290 --> 03:34:34,650
Me saving...

4596
03:34:34,650 --> 03:34:35,990
This rocket launcher.

4597
03:34:36,210 --> 03:34:37,350
Where did my rocket launcher go?

4598
03:34:37,530 --> 03:34:40,190
Me saving this rocket launcher will be worth it.

4599
03:34:40,530 --> 03:34:41,310
I swear.

4600
03:34:42,470 --> 03:34:43,610
I swear to god.

4601
03:34:44,970 --> 03:34:45,810
I believe...

4602
03:34:49,150 --> 03:34:50,230
My three bullets...

4603
03:34:51,190 --> 03:34:52,450
He'll show up!

4604
03:34:53,150 --> 03:34:54,450
He'll show up!

4605
03:34:55,290 --> 03:34:57,410
And then who will be laughing now?

4606
03:34:58,650 --> 03:35:00,210
I know he'll show up.

4607
03:35:00,590 --> 03:35:03,130
He's gonna go wart wart and then I'm gonna go boom.

4608
03:35:03,790 --> 03:35:05,110
I'll be like boom boom.

4609
03:35:11,830 --> 03:35:12,370
Alright.

4610
03:35:12,710 --> 03:35:13,470
Up I go.

4611
03:35:14,450 --> 03:35:15,670
I know you'll be there.

4612
03:35:17,290 --> 03:35:18,950
I know you'll be there.

4613
03:35:21,210 --> 03:35:22,750
I know you'll exist!

4614
03:35:23,050 --> 03:35:24,630
I saw you in the cutscene!

4615
03:35:26,950 --> 03:35:27,930
Oh my god.

4616
03:35:28,250 --> 03:35:29,290
That was almost...

4617
03:35:29,290 --> 03:35:31,010
It was almost a hit.

4618
03:35:32,710 --> 03:35:34,230
I saw him in the cutscene.

4619
03:35:34,350 --> 03:35:35,690
I swear to god he's real.

4620
03:35:37,590 --> 03:35:39,610
I swear to god he's real.

4621
03:35:39,610 --> 03:35:41,670
I saw him in the cutscene chat.

4622
03:35:47,860 --> 03:35:48,340
Okay.

4623
03:35:52,930 --> 03:35:54,030
Oh, where's the other...

4624
03:35:54,030 --> 03:35:54,770
Oh, there he is.

4625
03:36:01,610 --> 03:36:02,330
There we go.

4626
03:36:07,050 --> 03:36:07,530
Alright.

4627
03:36:11,850 --> 03:36:12,330
Okay.

4628
03:36:12,730 --> 03:36:13,810
I'm ready for him.

4629
03:36:14,310 --> 03:36:15,590
I'm ready for him!

4630
03:36:15,770 --> 03:36:16,470
I do it!

4631
03:36:16,570 --> 03:36:17,230
I do it!

4632
03:36:22,500 --> 03:36:22,980
Okay.

4633
03:36:23,260 --> 03:36:24,480
Okay, but I do it!

4634
03:36:24,480 --> 03:36:25,400
I do it!

4635
03:36:31,420 --> 03:36:32,480
I do it!

4636
03:36:32,620 --> 03:36:34,240
I knew you were real!

4637
03:36:34,460 --> 03:36:36,220
They all called me crazy!

4638
03:36:36,660 --> 03:36:38,400
But I knew you were real!

4639
03:36:42,240 --> 03:36:43,520
I knew it!

4640
03:36:43,720 --> 03:36:45,100
I knew you were real!

4641
03:36:45,420 --> 03:36:47,820
They all thought I was crazy!

4642
03:36:48,120 --> 03:36:49,920
But I was crazy now!

4643
03:36:50,880 --> 03:36:51,900
It's crazy!

4644
03:36:54,120 --> 03:36:54,800
Please!

4645
03:37:01,280 --> 03:37:01,960
Okay.

4646
03:37:02,320 --> 03:37:04,340
I knew he existed!

4647
03:37:06,860 --> 03:37:09,000
I got a little too excited!

4648
03:37:09,280 --> 03:37:11,180
That I shot myself too!

4649
03:37:12,420 --> 03:37:13,340
I didn't see him!

4650
03:37:13,440 --> 03:37:13,580
Yeah!

4651
03:37:13,720 --> 03:37:15,740
Cause I fucking nuked his ass!

4652
03:37:16,020 --> 03:37:17,520
I knew he existed!

4653
03:37:17,720 --> 03:37:19,580
I knew he was real!

4654
03:37:22,360 --> 03:37:24,060
He was real!

4655
03:37:24,360 --> 03:37:27,500
He called her crazy for telling the truth!

4656
03:37:28,120 --> 03:37:29,620
Oh my god!

4657
03:37:30,210 --> 03:37:31,500
This is my last one!

4658
03:37:33,240 --> 03:37:34,540
I knew it!

4659
03:37:34,800 --> 03:37:38,420
I knew keeping this was the right idea!

4660
03:37:39,040 --> 03:37:39,900
That's right!

4661
03:37:42,860 --> 03:37:44,340
I did it!

4662
03:37:44,560 --> 03:37:45,860
I did it!

4663
03:37:46,300 --> 03:37:46,700
I did it!

4664
03:37:47,540 --> 03:37:49,580
The last bullet too!

4665
03:37:50,020 --> 03:37:51,880
They called me crazy!

4666
03:37:52,340 --> 03:37:53,780
But I was right!

4667
03:38:02,490 --> 03:38:04,050
I did it!

4668
03:38:12,430 --> 03:38:14,470
I survived D-Day!

4669
03:38:15,470 --> 03:38:17,290
As a one man army!

4670
03:38:17,450 --> 03:38:19,870
They sent me in a solo mission!

4671
03:38:20,070 --> 03:38:20,830
Only me!

4672
03:38:35,270 --> 03:38:35,870
Whoa!

4673
03:38:48,430 --> 03:38:49,030
Alright!

4674
03:38:49,570 --> 03:38:51,670
I think this is a good part to end it guys!

4675
03:38:52,510 --> 03:38:56,270
Because apparently the next mission is one longest mission!

4676
03:38:56,510 --> 03:38:58,310
I would have been your daddy!

4677
03:38:58,950 --> 03:39:00,650
What a name for a mission!

4678
03:39:00,650 --> 03:39:01,610
Um...

4679
03:39:02,290 --> 03:39:04,330
But I'm gonna call it here everyone!

4680
03:39:05,110 --> 03:39:05,350
Uh...

4681
03:39:05,350 --> 03:39:09,630
But I hope you guys enjoyed the first part of Halo Combat Evolu...

4682
03:39:09,630 --> 03:39:10,050
Evolve!

4683
03:39:10,190 --> 03:39:11,590
I was gonna say Combat Evolution!

4684
03:39:14,930 --> 03:39:15,530
Um...

4685
03:39:15,530 --> 03:39:15,930
But...

4686
03:39:15,930 --> 03:39:17,490
I hope you guys enjoyed part one!

4687
03:39:17,630 --> 03:39:19,070
I've been having fun so far!

4688
03:39:19,950 --> 03:39:20,550
Um...

4689
03:39:20,550 --> 03:39:21,210
Um...

4690
03:39:21,210 --> 03:39:22,550
Not the...

4691
03:39:23,210 --> 03:39:24,930
The only thing I would say...

4692
03:39:26,010 --> 03:39:28,090
That I'm not having fun in...

4693
03:39:28,090 --> 03:39:29,110
Is...

4694
03:39:30,630 --> 03:39:31,310
Is...

4695
03:39:31,310 --> 03:39:32,070
Is the...

4696
03:39:32,070 --> 03:39:33,670
Is my Marine AI!

4697
03:39:34,370 --> 03:39:34,910
I...

4698
03:39:36,390 --> 03:39:37,070
Like...

4699
03:39:37,070 --> 03:39:38,510
Why does their AI...

4700
03:39:38,970 --> 03:39:40,830
Able to do all that shit!

4701
03:39:41,070 --> 03:39:42,610
And then my AI...

4702
03:39:42,610 --> 03:39:43,310
Just like...

4703
03:39:43,310 --> 03:39:44,550
Fucking bomb each other!

4704
03:39:45,450 --> 03:39:46,130
Like...

4705
03:39:47,630 --> 03:39:48,310
But...

4706
03:39:48,310 --> 03:39:49,170
Anyway guys...

4707
03:39:49,170 --> 03:39:50,710
I hope you guys had a great time...

4708
03:39:50,710 --> 03:39:52,750
Watching me play Halo...

4709
03:39:52,750 --> 03:39:53,910
For the first time!

4710
03:39:54,650 --> 03:39:54,950
Um...

4711
03:39:54,950 --> 03:39:56,690
Tomorrow is a very exciting day!

4712
03:39:56,970 --> 03:39:59,050
It is my first outfit reveal...

4713
03:39:59,050 --> 03:40:00,590
Since revealing the Bounty Hunter...

4714
03:40:00,590 --> 03:40:01,270
Skinsuit!

4715
03:40:01,390 --> 03:40:02,810
So I hope you guys come over...

4716
03:40:02,810 --> 03:40:03,770
And check it out!

4717
03:40:04,130 --> 03:40:04,470

4718
03:40:04,470 --> 03:40:05,790

4719
03:40:06,190 --> 03:40:06,490

4724
03:40:12,670 --> 03:40:13,850
I'm gonna go relax now!

4725
03:40:13,910 --> 03:40:15,090

4726
03:40:15,090 --> 03:40:16,250

4727
03:40:16,250 --> 03:40:17,050

Stay hydrated!

4732
03:40:21,810 --> 03:40:22,410
Posture check!

4733
03:40:22,610 --> 03:40:23,290
Get up and around!

4734
03:40:23,430 --> 03:40:24,370
To get that blood flowing!

4735
03:40:24,590 --> 03:40:25,070
And if you...

4736
03:40:25,070 --> 03:40:25,650
Stay up for me!

4737
03:40:25,890 --> 03:40:26,530
Head to bed!

4738
03:40:26,630 --> 03:40:27,110
Cause...

4739
03:40:27,110 --> 03:40:27,930
You deserve it!

4740
03:40:28,110 --> 03:40:29,530

4741
03:40:30,090 --> 03:40:30,810

4742
03:40:31,550 --> 03:40:32,030
