1
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,840
It's 1230.

2
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,040
Good morning everybody.

3
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,040
I'm still waking up guys.

4
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,120
I don't know why I'm playing Castu right now.

5
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,440
I'm not even gonna be playing DPS.

6
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,600
Guys I'm sorry I'm still... my brain is still waking up.

7
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:29,100
I can never do 1230 streams cuz my brain is always waking up.

8
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:38,440
I don't even know if the sound volume is okay.

9
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,780
Is my sound guy here?

10
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,220
Is he here?

11
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,100
Let me make sure my sound is like not too loud.

12
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,780
Let's see.

13
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,380
Look at this like gold gun.

14
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,880
Okay guys I might have like click baited you guys cuz I'm...

15
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,100
Okay to be fair it is Masters rank but it doesn't mean this account is Masters.

16
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:15,540
It just means that I... I will get... I'll definitely get into Master Games.

17
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:22,620
I just... this account might not be Masters but the player base is not as high as it once was.

18
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:46,260
That like there is a potential that I'll get into Masters games because one... one I found out I found out that like uh not today like recently that like uh Masters 5 is uh...

19
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,460
also I don't know if it's too loud.

20
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,380
I can't tell.

21
00:03:49,580 --> 00:04:16,680
Masters 5 is the threshold for support to hit top 500 and I heard a lot of players are like sort of low-key hard stuff Masters at the moment which like streams and a lot of players are like in Masters like a lot of like the good players I used to know back then are like in the Masters elo at the moment.

22
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,520
I was like what the fuck...

23
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,860
I was like, damn, okay.

24
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:34,720
And then so I was like, oh shit, wait, I'm gonna be griefing top 500 players?

25
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,640
Shit, okay, wait.

26
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:45,120
Cause I was like, okay, I do have an account that has Grandmaster MMR, but like obviously I'm not gonna be playing on that account.

27
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,540
Because I used to be good, hence the word, hence the past tense.

28
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,100
But now I've been playing like other games, like Bunny Garden and shit like that.

29
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:14,080
So like, I don't know how like Bunny Garden and Flight Simulator, so like I don't know how well that translates back to Overwatch these days.

30
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:22,820
So I was just like, um, so I was like, okay, maybe I shouldn't play on the Grandmaster account.

31
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,800
And I was like, alright, maybe I should do something that has a Master's MMR.

32
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:34,260
At first I was like, alright, I'm just gonna rank up this account to Master's and just go from there.

33
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,260
But this is my main account, by the way.

34
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,760
I haven't touched this main- I haven't touched the main account in fucking years with rank.

35
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:51,520
So because of that, they had a hard reset in rank from over- they had a hard reset from like Overwatch 1 to Overwatch 2.

36
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,880
Um, I mean like, it's not like super- okay, maybe not a hard reset, a soft reset.

37
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,080
Uh, but I mean like, it's not like super- okay, maybe not a hard reset, a soft reset.

38
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,280
But, so like, I did placements on this account.

39
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,380
And then, um...

40
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,980
I did placements on this account.

41
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,920
And then I did, uh, I- Yes, this is the Overwatch 1 account.

42
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,500
So like, this- this is actually- this is actually like the main main account.

43
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,220
And I was like, usually in the past I would be like, oh, I don't want to tape this account.

44
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,620
Because, uh, this account is so sacred.

45
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,640
It has like, you know, it has these.

46
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,080
It has all of these sprays, you know?

47
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,020
Oh my god, look at that.

48
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,460
You can tell it's the main account because it animates!

49
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,200
Whoa!

50
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,960
The sprays are animated!

51
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:37,860
Whoa!

52
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,800
Holy shit!

53
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,000
Look at that!

54
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,080
The sprays!

55
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,800
They move!

56
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:57,840
So, for those who are not familiar with the Overwatch rating system, the spray moves because I'm- I was top 500.

57
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,400
So you get a moving spray.

58
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,440
So...

59
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,900
So I was like, usually in the past, past Doki would be like, no, don't tape this account.

60
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,560
Because- because that's your top 500 account.

61
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,000
Don't play on it.

62
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,860
But like, all my top 500 records have been fucking erased.

63
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,780
Because they erased Overwatch 1 top 500 leaderboards.

64
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,340
So it doesn't matter anymore.

65
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,760
It doesn't matter anymore.

66
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,280
I don't- I don't care.

67
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,020
I didn't get top 500 in Overwatch 2 on this account.

68
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,900
I did it on a- I did it on a brand new account.

69
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,540
So like, this account doesn't have the Overwatch 2 top 500.

70
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,760
So it doesn't matter to me.

71
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,040
Plastic, thank you for the magenta soup!

72
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,500
Thank you, thank you!

73
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,140
Are you playing in flats right now?

74
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,240
What's the flats right now?

75
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,960
I don't watch.

76
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,500
I don't watch flats.

77
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,220
I'm sorry.

78
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,100
Thank you for the soup!

79
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,920
Magenta soup!

80
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,380
Thank you, thank you!

81
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,700
I know flats back when he used to grind Overwatch rank.

82
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,500
I bumped into him a lot in Overwatch rank.

83
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,600
But I don't watch his YouTube content.

84
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,160
Because his YouTube content- he's like- okay.

85
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,180
Like, the reason- flats is really good at gaming the algorithm.

86
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:25,940
And like, um, making videos that like, um, majority of the Overwatch players like to watch.

87
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,820
But like, I'm not majority.

88
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,180
I'm like the majority of the Overwatch players.

89
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,040
I just watch rank.

90
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,060
Like, I don't care.

91
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,640
I- I- I- right.

92
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,360
And also like, these days, I don't even really watch Overwatch rank streams.

93
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,020
And I only watch like, uh...

94
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,040
I only watch like, Surefour playing rank.

95
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,620
Because I think it's funny when he loses.

96
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,870
I'm not like other girls.

97
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,950
I- I just watch Surefour play Overwatch rank.

98
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,910
Because I just think it's funny.

99
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,270
And I guess like, Ruben too sometimes.

100
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,050
Uh, because he's a friend.

101
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,430
Um...

102
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,250
I don't think Soundguy is awake, guys.

103
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,410
Soundguy is not as awake as me.

104
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,350
So how has the- how- how has the sound been?

105
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,870
Uh, chat.

106
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:23,790
Yeah, I think that's like the only Overwatch content I've been watching the last couple of months.

107
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,830
Like, it's literally just Surefour mostly.

108
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:27,570
Um...

109
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,710
I'm like trying to think.

110
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,770
Have I watched anybody else?

111
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,950
I mean, I watched like...

112
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,730
Like, I guess like ten- like five minutes of Aspen.

113
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,650
Because I was like, what the fuck's meta?

114
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,830
I was like, she's a support player.

115
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:39,510
Like...

116
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,410
I was like, I was like, alright, let's see what's meta.

117
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,750
Okay, I need- I need to know what support meta is.

118
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,890
And then I was just like, alright, Aspen's a support player.

119
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,690
This is the best way to figure it out.

120
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,730
Watch the- watch the support player to see what meta is.

121
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,330
Call that a fair play.

122
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,470
But I haven't like actually watched Overwatch content.

123
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,470
I think like by the time Flats became an Overwatch content creator, I've stopped watching Overwatch.

124
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,570
Because I used to watch Overwatch content.

125
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,970
But like, I'm like- but that was like past Doki.

126
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,930
Very, very past Doki.

127
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,530
Also, you might be like, oh my god, Doki, why is your name on the left side Kitsune?

128
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,730
Um...

129
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,090
They have like a streamer mode now where your name changes every game.

130
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,810
Thank fucking god for that.

131
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,870
Because that actually is a lifesaver.

132
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,930
Because like, uh...

133
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,690
I- I was like a little bit embar- okay.

134
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:43,350
No, okay, this is also the reason why I stopped caring about like my rank on this account.

135
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,750
Because like, there's streamer mode now.

136
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,010
So then I was just like- and it changes every game.

137
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,110
So every game, um, your name changes on the bottom left.

138
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,710
Which is a fucking lifesaver.

139
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,010
Especially if I have a private profile.

140
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,910
So they'll never know that's me.

141
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,550
Uh, but like, I was a little embarrassed in Diamond ELO.

142
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:15,390
I was- I was- I was- I was a little- I was- I was a little embarrassed being- just a little bit embarrassed being Diamond ELO on this account.

143
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,950
So I had- I was like, oh, they must never know.

144
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,990
They must never know.

145
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,530
Um, no way you're actually good in video game.

146
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,530
I was good in video games.

147
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,350
We don't know anymore, no.

148
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,890
We don't- we don't know anymore.

149
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:38,790
Alright.

150
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,910
Um, let me ask like an- wait, is my- are any of my mods on?

151
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,290
That's a good question.

152
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,870
Wait, are any of my mods on?

153
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,750
What do you mean it was?

154
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,990
Okay, there's a reason why I didn't-.

155
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,050
I am on streamer mode.

156
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,290
I am a bit embarrassed.

157
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:04,510
Also, like, uh, Ruben asked if we wanted to do- I'm gonna play a couple of solo games first.

158
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:10,830
And then if I- if I derank, cause I'm actually like on the line between Diamond 1 and Diamond 2.

159
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:16,530
So like, if we- I won't join voice though.

160
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,490
I won't join voice call.

161
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,430
But if we derank, we're calling in reinforcements.

162
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,550
Which is like- so we have like- We have three games at least of solo.

163
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,850
We have three games of solo at least, okay?

164
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,290
So...

165
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,810
So that'll be- we're gonna try our best.

166
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,630
So yeah, anyway, we're gonna be queuing support, D1 support.

167
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,350
And then if we get to Masters, then yippee.

168
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,190
Uh, but anyway, you're gonna see what I mean.

169
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:55,890
Regardless of what rank I am at the moment, because I'm in D1, I will automatically-.

170
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,330
Not automatically, but majority of the time I'll be in Master games.

171
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:04,010
So like, in the end, I will throw- I will fucking get somebody out of top 500.

172
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,550
If it's- And that's all that matters, chat.

173
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,810
That's all that matters.

174
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,950
We're not playing Cassidy.

175
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,890
I just like- I just like warming up and...

176
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:18,270
Uh, like I just like the sound and hitting the headshots in uh...

177
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,630
In the training range on Cassidy.

178
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,490
Cause it's not as fun on any other character.

179
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,250
It's only on- It's only fun on Cassidy.

180
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,470
Um...

181
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,370
Alright, let's see.

182
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,150
I think my- I have like a backup sound guy, right?

183
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,430
Uhhhh...

184
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,910
Hahaha!

185
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,300
Alright.

186
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,320
Alright.

187
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,940
I have a backup sound guy, so I'm gonna check.

188
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:50,620
Also like, next week- By the way guys, next week- Uh, I tweeted about it, but next week- I said next week like five times.

189
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,020
Uh, I know I said that we're gonna have a rest week.

190
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,680
But like, it might not end up being a rest week.

191
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,800
Because there's a lot of stuff going on next week.

192
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,940
Hahaha!

193
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,420
There's- There's a- You'll find out when the schedule fucking drops.

194
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,620
Cause I'm still or- I'm still like figuring stuff out.

195
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,620
But you guys- You guys will see when the...

196
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,220
Uh, when the schedule drops and then you'll see why.

197
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,060
Hahaha!

198
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,520
You'll see- You'll see why.

199
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,660
Alright.

200
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,520
Oh my god.

201
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,860
Why do I hear myself?

202
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,800
Why do I hear myself?

203
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,140
Do I have a stream up?

204
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,500
Oh my god.

205
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,680
Where's the stream?

206
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,620
Oh fuck.

207
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,280
Okay, sorry.

208
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,220
Sorry guys.

209
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,380
I had a- I had my own stream open.

210
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,920
And I was like, what the fuck?

211
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,860
Who is that bitch?

212
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:43,720
Hahaha!

213
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,940
I'm really feeling the heat!

214
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,740
The voices!

215
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,540
Okay, here we go.

216
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,560
We're- We're gonna start.

217
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,520
Alright.

218
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,120
Uh, so yeah.

219
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,860
I am going to- Alright guys.

220
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:01,500
I'm- I'm a little embarrassed of showing you my- my profile right now.

221
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,200
So I'm gonna- I'm gonna change my icon as well.

222
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:05,700
Hahaha!

223
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,240
I just need you guys to know.

224
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:17,860
I have really- some really rough games while trying to- trying to see if I can speedrun the masters.

225
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:24,220
And like I- I had some- I had- but you can- this is the main account.

226
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,000
Haha!

227
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,260
So these are all the icons I have.

228
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,620
So- Hahaha!

229
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:30,860
Hahaha!

230
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:31,980
Hahaha!

231
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,280
Hahaha!

232
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,560
I'm just saying.

233
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,800
I got like a little embarrassed.

234
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,120
I'm- Okay look.

235
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,180
I'm also like a- look see?

236
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,540
It changes every time.

237
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,400
Guys.

238
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,020
It changes every time.

239
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,240
In the name.

240
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,180
So like, I got- Okay.

241
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:52,240
So the reason why I- I'm a little embarrassed is that, um, thank God I'm private profile.

242
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,820
But like, anyway.

243
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,160
Uh, haha!

244
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,940
Thank God it's- Thank God it- This is when I used to be good.

245
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,640
Hahaha!

246
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,140
So you get- These are all the top 500 icons.

247
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,840
So like this is when I was- I used to be decent at the game.

248
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,460
And- Hahaha!

249
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,720
And- And this is what I was complaining about.

250
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,160
Like you see the icon that used to be really pretty.

251
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,680
And then they started being just guns.

252
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,520
And I was like this is so ugly.

253
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,940
And then it was like so tiny too.

254
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,720
This used to be like the top 500 icon in season 24.

255
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,780
And I was like this is so ugly.

256
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,540
Compared to like this.

257
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,040
This was like actually so pretty to have.

258
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,380
And then- And then later on they're like oh we should add the top 500 icon logo.

259
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,620
So people would know it's top 500.

260
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,320
So like at first there was no top 500 icon logo.

261
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,260
But it's just a golden gun.

262
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,980
And it was so fucking ugly.

263
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,120
And then- Yeah.

264
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,860
I miss when top 500 icons used to look good.

265
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,180
And now they just use- And now it's just like the tag.

266
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,200
The gamer tag.

267
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,120
Which was only available for like one season or something.

268
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,360
Um...

269
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,840
Yeah so like they had to make a lot of them that they ran out of maps.

270
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,100
Which is understandable.

271
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:11,760
You know?

272
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,420
They actually ran out of maps for the top 500 icon.

273
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,520
Hahaha!

274
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:28,580
And back then top 500 was actually hard to get guys.

275
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,300
Okay?

276
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,260
Back then top 500 was hard to get.

277
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,660
Cause there was an actual player base chat.

278
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,000
So you can't say that.

279
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,700
It was actually pretty difficult.

280
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,840
Cause it wasn't masters.

281
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,360
Hahaha!

282
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,740
Hahaha!

283
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,860
It was- It wasn't masters.

284
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,480
Hahaha!

285
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,100
It was- Hahaha!

286
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,860
Anyway.

287
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,820
So like the reason- Another reason why I am uh...

288
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,300
Uh...

289
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,340
Uh...

290
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,200
The reason why that like uh...

291
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,500
I am a little embarrassed of showing my profile at the moment.

292
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,900
Is because the most played hours on it is Kiriko.

293
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,500
But I have a solid 30% win rate on Kiriko at the moment.

294
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,660
Because I- Every time we're losing I just swap to Kiriko.

295
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,220
Hahaha!

296
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,020
Hahaha!

297
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,580
Hahaha!

298
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:34,420
I had to play Kiriko for like you know- Okay cause like- There- Okay because- But because it's like- Well I- We're losing I might as well practice Kiriko.

299
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,140
Hahaha!

300
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:35,840
You know?

301
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,280
Hahaha!

302
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,780
That's like- That's like my mindset going in.

303
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,840
I'm like well we're losing anyway.

304
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,460
So I think it's like a good time to practice.

305
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,160
Hahaha!

306
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,680
Hahaha!

307
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,080
Hahaha!

308
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,680
Hahaha!

309
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,220
Hahaha!

310
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,080
So that's like- Hahaha!

311
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:53,940
Hahaha!

312
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,360
Hahaha!

313
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,420
Hahaha!

314
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,120
Like it's a- It's a good time to practice her.

315
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,480
Since like she is meta.

316
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,840
So I might as well.

317
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,940
But I do play Kiriko sometimes when I don't- When I'm not losing.

318
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:12,040
So like the moments when I win on Kiriko is when I like- Is when like I automatically- I pick her out of like first hand.

319
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,080
Not because like you know I was- Why is there a- What the fuck?

320
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,140
How many fucking- Okay this is why I need to warm up.

321
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,200
Oh my god I missed like 20 shots.

322
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,060
It's cause they're not training bots.

323
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,100
So like it was- It's- Oh the fall off damage too.

324
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,740
That's insane.

325
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,180
Where are they?

326
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:30,980
I hear them.

327
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,200
I hear you!

328
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,460
Oh okay.

329
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,360
Nice.

330
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,520
Hahaha!

331
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,100
So what do you usually play?

332
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,540
I like- I like Ana.

333
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,900
Ana is like the most fun.

334
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,760
But then Ana also requires aim.

335
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,520
Which like I don't know if I have right now.

336
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,240
Cause I'm still- I'm still waking up guys.

337
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,620
Like- Please Vera let me have this warm- Oh!

338
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,440
This is bullshit.

339
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:01,280
I don't know if I have the aim at the moment for Ana cause I'm still warming up.

340
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,180
This is different.

341
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,480
They're not training dummies.

342
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,600
They actually move.

343
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,820
They actually- These people move.

344
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,380
Nice I'll take that.

345
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,600
Jesus Christ the fall off.

346
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,980
There you go.

347
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,480
They're not like training dummies where I can- Where I know the pattern of their movements.

348
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,280
These people actually have strafe patterns.

349
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:24,880
Hello?

350
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,780
Where people at?

351
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,480
Oh!

352
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,380
Please.

353
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,800
Please be nice.

354
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,580
Okay thank you.

355
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,720
Killing the AFK.

356
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,040
That's right.

357
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,220
I gotta take what I can get guys.

358
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,740
I'm that desperate.

359
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,360
The fuck is this?

360
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,680
Look at that Cassie fall off damage.

361
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,520
Holy- No bro!

362
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,500
Respect the 1v1!

363
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,520
Okay we're gonna bring- Alright we're AFKing now too.

364
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,620
We gotta bring down the game volume a little bit.

365
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,780
Alright I brought it down.

366
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,360
Let me know if it's better.

367
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,120
Sound guy.

368
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,320
Alright.

369
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,860
Yeah exact.

370
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,440
Oh my God please.

371
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,260
You guys didn't see anything.

372
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,040
No!

373
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,840
No bitch get out!

374
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,900
Oh my God.

375
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,680
Please.

376
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,840
I'm so lucky.

377
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,120
Oh my God.

378
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,940
I swear guys.

379
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:42,760
If it was not 1230- I swear if it was not 1252 I hits those.

380
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,740
Guys.

381
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,560
Guys.

382
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,560
I'm just saying.

383
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,840
You should see me.

384
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,880
I swear in NiteQs, okay?

385
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,140
In NiteQs is where I shine.

386
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,460
I swear in NiteQs is where I shine!

387
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,200
I hit so many shots in NiteQs!

388
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,000
I swear to God I'm not fucking with you guys!

389
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,760
I'm not coping!

390
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,020
You should see me in Death Master in NiteQs!

391
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,480
I swear!

392
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,140
It's just, look, things are rough right now.

393
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,360
So I brought down the sound volume by the way, sound guy.

394
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,120
It's just rough.

395
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,760
It's just rough at the moment.

396
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,820
I swear!

397
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,940
The moment we hit the NiteQ time hours...

398
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,800
I'll be like...

399
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,800
Bop bop!

400
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,900
Headshot, headshot!

401
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,800
It's just, we're at a rough place.

402
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:02,560
I know I say that and I should definitely not play Ana right now.

403
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,720
I should not!

404
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,660
Have mercy!

405
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,120
I just woke up!

406
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,280
Breezy, thank you for the super chat!

407
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,400
Thank you, thank you!

408
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,300
Please!

409
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,760
It's just a little rough.

410
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,580
Look, see it changes.

411
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,360
The name changes and everything.

412
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,220
That's why I'm like, I'm okay with...

413
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,620
Copium in its natural habitat.

414
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,040
Please thank you for the super chat.

415
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,060
It's not copium!

416
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
It's a scientific fact!

417
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,660
Look, see I hit those!

418
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,620
Okay, we don't hit those but it's because he was strafing.

419
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,320
So like, I got confused, you know?

420
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,980
You know, and like...

421
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,020
Oh my gosh.

422
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,660
Oh shit!

423
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,840
Oh, I fucking might die though!

424
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,480
I told you I hit those!

425
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,160
Bitch!

426
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,420
Oh, you see I hit both tracer shots too!

427
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,460
You guys didn't believe me.

428
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,320
I'm slowly waking up.

429
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,080
I'm slowly waking up.

430
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,040
I'm slowly waking up.

431
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,180
This is me in my natural habitat!

432
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,980
There, nobody believed me until I did a fucking sick-ass shot on the tracer.

433
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,540
There we go.

434
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,120
Oh, that's not my fault.

435
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,100
If you die, we have a Kiriko.

436
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,440
We also have a Kiriko.

437
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,740
That is not my fault.

438
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,680
Please get rid of this fucking tracer!

439
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,200
Holy shit!

440
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,240
Am I the only one that hits the tracer?

441
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,180
It's okay, we get like...

442
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,200
We get like three free games.

443
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,860
And then if we derank, we'll call in the reinforcements.

444
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,220
Oh god.

445
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,080
I think I might go Zen actually.

446
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:05,840
You know what?

447
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,000
Alright, it's fine.

448
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,200
It's fine.

449
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:08,920
I'm believing you!

450
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,280
And he's anti!

451
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,160
Okay.

452
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,120
Okay.

453
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,060
Bro, okay.

454
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,840
Come on.

455
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,180
Alright, we're gonna help save our fucking junker real fast.

456
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:21,780
WAH!

457
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,020
Okay, never save your junker.

458
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,080
Never save your junker.

459
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,820
Okay.

460
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,360
I'm gonna go Zenyatta.

461
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,040
Okay, here we go.

462
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,180
Here we go.

463
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,840
This will work, I swear.

464
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,140
Never.

465
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,820
I have the most healing!

466
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,340
You guys cannot be like, Doki, heal your teammates!

467
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,440
I literally have the most healing out of both teams!

468
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,400
Like, look at that!

469
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,920
He's so scared of me now!

470
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,860
Look at him!

471
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,860
He's so fucking scared!

472
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,160
Okay, there we go.

473
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,520
Alright, we don't have cleanse.

474
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,180
We're so fucked.

475
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,720
We're so fucked.

476
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,380
I... I...

477
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,460
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

478
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,540
There you go.

479
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,080
Fuck you.

480
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,560
Never say...

481
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,060
Never say I'm washed.

482
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,700
I'm running away.

483
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,000
This junker has ult.

484
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,920
This junker 100% has ult.

485
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,220
Never say I'm washed again!

486
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,000
Bam!

487
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,280
That's when you know!

488
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,720
Just chase your things.

489
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,560
Alright, here we go.

490
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,320
Okay, our Soldier fucking sucks.

491
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,080
Bro.

492
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,740
If I'm not afraid of getting banned, I would... I would say something.

493
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,480
Cause they're like apparently really harsh on bans now for toxicity.

494
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,840
So I gotta... I gotta make sure I don't say anything on chat.

495
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,640
Apparently they're actually like banning people for shit.

496
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,120
When it comes to toxicity.

497
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,220
Like even you say something like, bro fucking do be better at DPS.

498
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,080
Like what the fuck.

499
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,720
You can actually get banned for it.

500
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,540
You get chat banned.

501
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,900
I've been seeing like... like the... it's like a lot harsher now.

502
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,780
The moderating of the...

503
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,820
I heard like the... the... the Overwatch...

504
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,700
2-4...

505
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,220
Oh, yeah.

506
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,240
You are Kiri.

507
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,720
And you over extend.

508
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,220
Oh my god.

509
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,760
The shit talking are Kiri because they don't heal.

510
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,800
Okay.

511
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,480
Alright, I'm gonna go more.

512
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,860
Your place is where I can't heal you.

513
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,120
I told you it's not me.

514
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:56,600
Alright.

515
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,940
But like...

516
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,660
But like, yeah.

517
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,480
What was I saying?

518
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:01,840
Yeah.

519
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,520
The...

520
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,820
They like ban... chat ban you or like actually straight up ban you.

521
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,740
Like a lot easily.

522
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,300
So like you say something that is any remotely toxic at all.

523
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,280
You can actually get banned.

524
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,440
And I'm like... I don't...

525
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:18,740
No!

526
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:19,920
Okay.

527
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,520
Okay.

528
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,080
I grieved there.

529
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,500
Okay.

530
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,360
Alright.

531
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:22,880
Guys.

532
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,600
I will admit I actually grieved.

533
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,580
I actually grieved.

534
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,600
I was not paying attention.

535
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,420
I was looking at my chat.

536
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,460
I was looking at my chat.

537
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:32,880
Oops.

538
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,080
It's okay.

539
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,260
We can get this back.

540
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,240
It's... I can have one...

541
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,400
I can have one game where I don't play perfectly.

542
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,420
Like... Come on.

543
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,640
I mean this is like the first fight where I don't play perfectly.

544
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,580
Like... Come on.

545
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,040
It's literally the first fight.

546
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,480
Alright.

547
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,160
Let's see.

548
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,500
Alright.

549
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,440
I'm healing you.

550
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,340
I'm doing my job.

551
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,720
I'm doing my job.

552
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,000
Okay.

553
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,940
Poor Soldier.

554
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,720
That poor fucking guy.

555
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,600
Alright.

556
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,320
Here we go.

557
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,360
There.

558
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,200
Look at that.

559
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,240
Look at my skill.

560
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:17,940
Look.

561
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,900
This was obviously not winnable.

562
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,680
Not gonna lie.

563
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,440
It would not matter if I play like the best game of my life.

564
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,400
These...

565
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,600
They're... They're like... Yeah.

566
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,700
This... This team is not salvageable.

567
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,380
It's not salvageable at all.

568
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:38,780
Alright.

569
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,560
Where... Where is...

570
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,680
She recalls here.

571
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,060
She blinks here.

572
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,140
Hello.

573
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,420
Thank you.

574
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,580
Soldier!

575
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,440
Are you... Okay.

576
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,060
I was gonna say.

577
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,860
Soldier, please.

578
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,820
So... Are you serious?

579
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,240
And then you flip it?

580
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,340
Okay.

581
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,520
Alright.

582
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,260
This is...

583
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:56,860
This is a little...

584
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,960
This is a little tilting.

585
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,220
He actually let it flip.

586
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,820
Holy shit.

587
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,700
Alright.

588
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,640
Look at him run.

589
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,640
Alright.

590
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:07,840
There.

591
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,560
We flipped it back.

592
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
We didn't even...

593
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,580
Oh my god.

594
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,040
We literally got the point for 8%.

595
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,500
Come on.

596
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,680
Bro.

597
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,540
You're full healed.

598
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,120
Look.

599
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,420
I played a almost perfect game.

600
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:22,980
Chat.

601
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:23,620
Like...

602
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,280
Whoops.

603
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:24,880
Okay.

604
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,100
It was almost perfect.

605
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,920
Guys.

606
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,960
But I know damn well these guys are not playing any perfect...

607
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,100
These guys are definitely far from perfect.

608
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,680
Oh my...

609
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,960
Oh my god.

610
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,660
They fucking gone.

611
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,000
Look.

612
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,160
This is top 500 reaction time right there.

613
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,000
Holy shit.

614
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,220
Oh my god.

615
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,560
That's right.

616
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,940
Top 500 reaction time.

617
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,320
How did I live?

618
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,020
I shifted.

619
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,460
You can shift in alt form now.

620
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,820
Which is great.

621
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,300
That's...

622
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,040
That makes me very happy.

623
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,080
But yeah.

624
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,360
You can shift in alt form.

625
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,280
Yeah.

626
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:09,780
That's right.

627
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,540
Look at that fucking reflexes.

628
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,100
They definitely have junker ult.

629
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,660
So I'm both gonna save my Q...

630
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,160
My shift.

631
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,320
Uh.

632
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:20,700
See.

633
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,700
I need to charge up my fucking Q too.

634
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,060
It's been working.

635
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,840
Will you be okay...

636
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,800
She's not gonna be okay.

637
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,320
She's not gonna be okay.

638
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,260
I TOLD YOU.

639
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,320
IT'S NOT MY FUN!!

640
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:38,440
I SWIFT It doesn't matter.

641
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,760
It doesn't fucking matter.

642
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,280
A team will be dead no matter what.

643
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,460
I'm not playing Ana because like...

644
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,540
This team does not deserve my Ana.

645
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,940
I'm not gonna play this.

646
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,300
Especially this fucking venture.

647
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:03,000
Like, nothing will save this venture no matter what hero I play.

648
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,940
Go Life Weaver?

649
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,480
No.

650
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,800
Life Weaver... I still don't know how to play it.

651
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:21,120
Because Life Weaver was locked for the longest time until they were like, we're gonna make every hero free.

652
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:27,640
But like... but like I actually do not know how to play Life Weaver.

653
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,420
Please!

654
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,160
Holy shit!

655
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,580
We don't deserve to win this.

656
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,000
Oh my god.

657
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,320
Please!

658
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,320
How do you have nine deaths?

659
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,140
5200 heal!

660
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,400
That's insane!

661
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,200
Oh my god!

662
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,200
Bro!

663
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,320
Oh yeah!

664
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,180
The one that's not getting flamed is definitely throwing.

665
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:18,240
They were flaming the fucking... You cannot blame me for the loss.

666
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,100
Because I... I have the most healing.

667
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,680
Out of two teams I have the most healing.

668
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,380
Ok, we have like one more game to like... protect our...

669
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,340
Protect our hero.

670
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,160
And then I'll call in reinforcements.

671
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,340
Oh my god.

672
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,500
If the games get more rough I'll call in reinforcements.

673
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,660
You're the support they always be.

674
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,060
Yes!

675
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,300
But like... I wasn't the problem.

676
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,320
Guys.

677
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,340
Guys, you can't blame me when I'm not the problem.

678
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Oh my god, I almost fucking...

679
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,540
What the fuck?!

680
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,640
What?!

681
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,360
He fucking flicked me!

682
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,280
Holy shit, the fucking turret bait!

683
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,520
That's actually crazy.

684
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,460
The turret bait.

685
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,400
There we go.

686
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,100
Watch that.

687
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:11,980
Look at that flick.

688
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:12,840
Guys.

689
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,360
Look at that fucking flick.

690
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,180
Oh.

691
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,320
Guys, his strafe pattern!

692
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,440
His strafe pattern!

693
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,980
I couldn't download it in time!

694
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,060
I couldn't!

695
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,080
Oh, I'm scared.

696
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,720
Oh, I hear him.

697
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:33,960
There we go.

698
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,440
Look at that.

699
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,920
I should have done the cool kais.

700
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,660
Don't look at...

701
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,460
Oh, you see that headshot?!

702
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,500
You see that?!

703
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,560
That's fucking right.

704
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,240
That's right!

705
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,600
My first headshot of the day!

706
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,440
Oh god.

707
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,240
Oh, nevermind.

708
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,000
That's her...

709
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,140
That's her 20th headshot of the day.

710
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,380
Guys, this helps me warm up.

711
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,700
Okay, I need this.

712
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,960
Okay, guys.

713
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,900
Thank you for the shot.

714
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,320
Ooh, a reaper!

715
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,840
You know what?

716
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,180
Maybe that will hit somebody.

717
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,120
Come on, Junkrat.

718
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,840
Oh god.

719
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,400
Oh god.

720
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:20,960
Guys, never go inside a tight corridor with a Junkrat.

721
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,240
Oh!

722
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,020
We did it!

723
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,180
See?

724
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,920
I'm waking up, guys!

725
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,240
I'm waking up!

726
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:28,920
Look!

727
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,120
I'm gonna grief somebody's top 500 game!

728
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,200
I told you guys.

729
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,060
No matter what, I will eventually grief someone's top 500 game.

730
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,760
Right here.

731
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,160
I'm gonna grief somebody's top 500 game.

732
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,400
Alright.

733
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,140
Alright.

734
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,960
Does this team deserve...

735
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,400
Does this team deserve my... my honor?

736
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,660
We'll see.

737
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,280
Alright, let me grab reinforcements just in case.

738
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,000
Alright.

739
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:55,780
Um...

740
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,560
Um...

741
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,440
Okay, there we go.

742
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,480
Guys, I got the... I have the...

743
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,600
I have the... uh...

744
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,780
reinforcements on backup.

745
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,040
Just in case!

746
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,780
Just in case this match goes terribly wrong.

747
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,180
Thank you, ՛գ renovation!

748
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,100
Thank you.

749
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,660
Believe in GrumpyPants!

750
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,100
Alright.

751
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:26,600
We'll see.

752
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,660
I realized like, what is a streamer mode name too.

753
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,200
Like, what names are streamer modes.

754
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:32,960
So many people!

755
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,700
So many people are using streamer mode these days.

756
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,460
I mean, it makes sense because you know, you could flame And then like, they won't know it's you.

757
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,300
The ELO insurance.

758
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,900
Oh my god, it's from Amatra.

759
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,560
It's from Amatra.

760
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,140
Oh my shit's fucking bugging.

761
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,940
Holy fuck.

762
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,460
I love hearing that!

763
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,560
Don't you love it when your tank is like, oh my shit is bugging?

764
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,780
I'm just freaking out.

765
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,120
Please!

766
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,420
You're literally a tank!

767
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,920
Please don't do this to me!

768
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,540
Just leave!

769
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,100
Leave the game!

770
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,680
Okay, I'm good.

771
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,840
Okay, I'm good.

772
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,740
Ash won.

773
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,060
Oh my god.

774
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:26,100
You know you love hearing your fucking tank being like, oh man, my shit's bugging, bro.

775
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,060
He's good.

776
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,300
Guys, he's good now, guys.

777
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,400
He's good now.

778
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,280
Everything's okay.

779
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,100
Look at that, I can hit a tracer.

780
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,700
A little psych.

781
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,860
Just gave you guys a little of a heart attack, but it's okay.

782
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,900
Everything's fine now.

783
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,080
Always keep your teammates on your toes.

784
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:48,660
Exactly.

785
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,520
Alright.

786
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,420
You're fine.

787
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:52,720
Yeah.

788
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,360
Yeah, see?

789
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,140
I might have missed like two more shots, but you see the- No!

790
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,160
It's a Sigma!

791
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,700
Wait, they were Sigma this entire time.

792
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,720
I hate playing Ana against shields.

793
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,200
It's like, not fun.

794
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,280
Like, I guess like, Rein's shield is okay, but like, how the fuck?

795
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,880
Oh my god.

796
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,660
Okay, I don't have to ult then.

797
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:19,960
Oh!

798
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,120
Please!

799
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,360
Please, I- I've done everything I could.

800
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,260
No.

801
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:25,920
No.

802
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,500
Where's the- Where's the- Doom!

803
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:27,920
Please!

804
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,480
Doom!

805
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,120
Pick me!

806
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,640
Pick me!

807
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,960
I've been trying to kill you this entire time!

808
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,940
I've been trying to- I've been trying to fucking kill you, I do!

809
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,120
Are you fucking kidding- Oh my god!

810
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:45,760
Picanto!

811
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,880
Go, Picanto!

812
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,580
Go!

813
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,200
Picanto, please!

814
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,320
Pick me, Picanto!

815
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,960
Holy shit, who is he?

816
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,720
It's fine.

817
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,600
He didn't need my ult.

818
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,600
I saved my ult.

819
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,560
Wait, wait, wait.

820
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:04,940
I saved my ult.

821
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:04,940
I saved my ult.

822
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,620
I saved my ult for next fight, guys.

823
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,060
I- I- That was intentional.

824
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,320
Because I knew he would clutch this.

825
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,360
This was the same guy where his shit was bugging.

826
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,640
It was the same guy.

827
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,520
Don't butterfly me.

828
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,140
Oh my god.

829
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,100
Please.

830
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:22,920
There.

831
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,260
This is how much I believe in him.

832
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,720
I believe in you.

833
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,620
I believe in you, Picanto!

834
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,300
Picanto, you got this!

835
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:33,940
Picanto!

836
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,260
Where is he?

837
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,080
Where is he?

838
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,980
Wait, where is Picanto?

839
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:41,960
There he is.

840
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,560
Look at that.

841
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:45,920
See?

842
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,620
This man.

843
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,480
This man deserves it.

844
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,780
Cool, guys.

845
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,320
Don't look at- Don't look at me.

846
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,960
But then I missed.

847
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,340
Maybe I should start looking.

848
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,460
Okay.

849
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:57,940
We're fine.

850
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,260
See?

851
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,860
We are so fine.

852
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,840
We're so healthy.

853
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,680
Look at that.

854
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,400
I-

855
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,650
They didn't see.

856
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,730
Picanto did not see.

857
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,070
He didn't see.

858
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:21,290
Okay.

859
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,070
That was a little embarrassing.

860
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,330
Big ass.

861
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,970
Always believe in Picanto.

862
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,530
Guys, look.

863
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,750
I've warmed up in everything.

864
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,070
But like...

865
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,030
I've warmed up in everything?

866
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,590
What the fuck is he doing here?

867
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:40,890
What the fuck is he doing here?

868
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:41,570
Oh my god.

869
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,130
What are they all doing here?

870
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:43,610
Oh my god.

871
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:43,610
What are they all doing here?

872
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,810
Oh god.

873
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:52,090
He has all- He actually has all- There, I hit it.

874
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:52,590
There.

875
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:53,930
I hit it, guys.

876
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,090
I redeemed myself.

877
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,890
Everything there is pain.

878
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,550
Thank you for the CB chat.

879
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,190
There.

880
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:04,610
See?

881
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,450
I hit those.

882
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,890
I hit the aunties.

883
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,490
I told you.

884
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,710
I told you.

885
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:17,130
It was a bait, chat.

886
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,430
It was just a bait.

887
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,470
Damn it.

888
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:21,170
You misread.

889
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:21,530
Look.

890
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,870
I get one mistake.

891
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:23,750
Oh.

892
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,770
Oh yeah.

893
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:25,630
So like...

894
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,090
Look.

895
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,910
Every game, I get one mistake.

896
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,310
This is my one.

897
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,490
That's how I realized.

898
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,290
I realized I was like...

899
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,850
My mic was too low a bit.

900
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,170
When it was a little too low.

901
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,030
Every game, I just...

902
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,170
I get one mistake.

903
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,170
This is my one.

904
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:53,070
This is my one, guys.

905
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:55,910
Alright.

906
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:56,450
Here we go.

907
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:56,770
Let's go.

908
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,830
Only one freebie.

909
00:41:59,010 --> 00:41:59,210
Look.

910
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,290
We're still gonna win right now.

911
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:00,670
Regardless.

912
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:04,030
Unless we don't fucking get past the first...

913
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,730
The first... What is it called?

914
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:07,330
Oh my gosh.

915
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:08,010
Overwatch terms.

916
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,550
I already forgot Overwatch terms, guys.

917
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,010
Where are those... Where are those... Checkpoints?

918
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:14,270
Yeah.

919
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:15,070
The first checkpoint.

920
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:16,550
It's fine.

921
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:17,470
The first tick.

922
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:17,790
Yeah.

923
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:18,570
Guys.

924
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,490
This is how I watched them.

925
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,950
I actually don't remember Overwatch terms at the moment.

926
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:23,990
Here we go.

927
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:25,750
It's okay.

928
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,330
We can do this.

929
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,910
I didn't get this top 500 spray.

930
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,550
To miss my antis.

931
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:33,930
Holy shit.

932
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:34,650
He's going straight to point.

933
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,270
They might have seen me.

934
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,650
Okay.

935
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,030
Ow.

936
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,030
No.

937
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,350
I lived though.

938
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:44,630
You guys ready?

939
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,510
I'm like on their hand and they're saying...

940
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:46,990
No.

941
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,690
We are absolutely not ready.

942
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,710
Guys.

943
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:50,150
Guys.

944
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,210
There is actually a chance we might lose.

945
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,090
There's...

946
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,210
It's crazy for me to say.

947
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,030
But...

948
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,810
But we live in a world where we can actually lose.

949
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,670
Oh, look at that!

950
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:06,350
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

951
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:07,410
No, shit!

952
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:09,370
Okay.

953
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:10,390
Okay, we're fine.

954
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:11,710
We're okay.

955
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:16,630
I'm gonna swap off because like I am not playing... I am not playing Ana into this.

956
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,870
I'm not playing Ana into this.

957
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:21,930
No, fuck that shit.

958
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:25,410
This is... this is too much.

959
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:29,650
This is too much.

960
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:29,710
This is too much.

961
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:33,750
I refuse to heal through a Sigma shield.

962
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,130
Alright, Kiriko.

963
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:40,230
Guys, it's not because we're losing them swapping to Kiriko.

964
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,830
It just makes sense.

965
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,450
I hate playing Ana against Sigma.

966
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,690
Okay guys, it's not because I'm giving up.

967
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:52,630
It actually makes sense to play Kiriko in this scenario.

968
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:58,390
Wait, we should fucking push up because...

969
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:00,090
Yeah.

970
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:02,350
Oh!

971
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:03,830
There we go.

972
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:04,050
See?

973
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:04,930
Look at that!

974
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:08,770
We're slowly but surely raising our Kiriko win rate!

975
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:10,670
Look at that.

976
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:11,390
I told you!

977
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:13,470
It makes sense to play Kiriko!

978
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,430
This was my first death, by the way.

979
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:17,910
I only had one death, guys.

980
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:19,530
One death.

981
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,770
That's how you fucking play support.

982
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:27,550
Alright.

983
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,470
I'll just be like, invite me whenever.

984
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,290
Invite me whenever.

985
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:36,830
There we go.

986
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:37,490
Alright.

987
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:39,530
Even though we won that game...

988
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,650
Even though we won that game...

989
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,630
Like, I... Wait, oops, sorry.

990
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:48,570
Let's just get some Overwatch 2 insurance in here.

991
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,430
We're still... We're not gonna be in like a voice chat with them though.

992
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:52,730
We're just gonna be like chilling.

993
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,010
But Kondo was good.

994
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,390
He actually hard carried us.

995
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,170
He hard carried me.

996
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:00,950
Oh my god.

997
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,310
Let's go pick Kondo!

998
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:04,530
Oh wait.

999
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:05,830
Alright, never mind.

1000
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,490
We get... We have to... We play another one.

1001
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:09,730
Because our insurance isn't even ready.

1002
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,910
Rank insurance time!

1003
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,730
Our insurance was not ready.

1004
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,230
So we play another.

1005
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,070
Alright.

1006
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,270
We need to slowly warm back up or aim anyway.

1007
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:22,130
That's fine.

1008
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:23,710
That's fine.

1009
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:24,770
Alright, watch this guys.

1010
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,590
Craziest headshot you're gonna see.

1011
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:29,410
Craziest headshot.

1012
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:30,410
Right here.

1013
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:34,290
What the fuck kind of fight is going on right now?

1014
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:39,870
I told you.

1015
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:46,450
WAHOO!

1016
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,070
SHIT!

1017
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:50,170
I told you.

1018
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:51,830
I told you.

1019
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,830
Craziest headshot you're ever gonna see.

1020
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,190
Woah, woah.

1021
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:57,850
Hey guys.

1022
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:58,370
Hey.

1023
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:00,230
Calm down!

1024
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:02,650
Hey guys.

1025
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:03,630
Calm down!

1026
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:06,910
Let me regen my fucking HP.

1027
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:10,730
She's popping off.

1028
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:11,890
There you go.

1029
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:12,530
I told you.

1030
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:14,450
Okay.

1031
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:15,050
Look.

1032
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,850
I popped off in the beginning though.

1033
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,970
Lucias are hard to hit, okay?

1034
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,110
They all like...

1035
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,710
Look at them fucking riding around.

1036
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,270
Like a little rat.

1037
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,090
Come on.

1038
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:27,510
Come on Lucio.

1039
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:32,110
Also, Sound Guy, I like adjusted my mic a little bit.

1040
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:32,990
Sounds still okay.

1041
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,610
Unless Sound Guy like left after it peaced out after that.

1042
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:37,790
Bro, fuck off!

1043
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,170
Bro, what the fuck?

1044
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:39,890
There's a Hammond?

1045
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,090
Don't make me fucking come up here.

1046
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:43,610
That's fucking right.

1047
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:44,490
I can jump.

1048
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:46,370
That's a streamer mode name too.

1049
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:47,310
Please res me.

1050
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:51,130
You get to like see all the streamer mode names while you're playing.

1051
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,460
You're gonna fucking suzu.

1052
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,720
But you can't suzu from these shots.

1053
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,900
Look at that.

1054
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,260
Wait, is it just me?

1055
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,220
And the... Oh no.

1056
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,100
It's me, Kiriko and Sombra.

1057
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,440
Where the fuck's the Sombra?

1058
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,060
Oh shit.

1059
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,040
Oh shit.

1060
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:18,760
Yeah, it's never a good idea to fucking hide you in front of a Kiriko.

1061
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,260
Oh.

1062
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:20,660
Oh.

1063
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,040
Wow!

1064
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,160
Please spare me.

1065
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,620
Potato, thank you for the super sticker.

1066
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,020
Thank you.

1067
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:26,560
Thank you.

1068
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,420
Where was that?

1069
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,940
I'm gonna AFK for an hour.

1070
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:30,940
Can I just see you later?

1071
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,320
Jessie, thank you for the super chat.

1072
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:32,620
Thank you.

1073
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,320
Thank you.

1074
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:34,700
Oh god.

1075
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,840
I hate Soldier and Strafe.

1076
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:37,400
I hate Soldier and Strafe.

1077
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,020
Please, fight each other and then let me take two kills.

1078
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,320
Fight each other, please.

1079
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:45,780
There we go.

1080
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,280
Oh no!

1081
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,480
Who expected the fourth party?

1082
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,900
Who expected that?

1083
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,440
You know I'm inspired now.

1084
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:58,980
I'm not inspired.

1085
00:47:59,200 --> 00:47:59,660
I'm...

1086
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:02,740
I haven't...

1087
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,620
I haven't played Tracer in so long.

1088
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,380
Guys, it's been a while since I played Tracer.

1089
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,400
Oh god, not against Kiriko.

1090
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,840
Playing against Kiriko with Tracer is like...

1091
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,740
is like playing against my counter.

1092
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,140
Oh god, that's scary.

1093
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:21,940
Oh!

1094
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,540
It's like one headshot away.

1095
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,180
Oh, please have mercy.

1096
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,000
What's that?

1097
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:30,340
I see her.

1098
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:30,720
Lucio.

1099
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:32,860
Okay.

1100
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:33,660
Full regen.

1101
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,400
Because I don't know my map.

1102
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,080
Health packs.

1103
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,600
That's the only reason to play Tracer.

1104
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:40,880
You know where all the health packs are.

1105
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,820
But I don't.

1106
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:42,480
That's the thing.

1107
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,340
Oh!

1108
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:45,840
No!

1109
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,420
Here we go.

1110
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,400
I take those.

1111
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,160
I'm desperate.

1112
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:54,500
I'm desperate.

1113
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,660
I'm desperate.

1114
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:57,220
No!

1115
00:48:59,420 --> 00:48:59,960
No!

1116
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:03,620
Okay.

1117
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,040
Where is...

1118
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:06,240
It's okay.

1119
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,100
I'm rank one in deathmatch.

1120
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,080
Guys, don't talk to me unless you're rank one in deathmatch.

1121
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,680
Where the fuck is he?

1122
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,500
Oh shit.

1123
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,400
Watch this.

1124
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:18,780
Whoa!

1125
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,220
Sombra!

1126
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,680
Oh no, I don't have blinks anymore.

1127
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,500
No!

1128
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:28,540
No!

1129
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:29,760
No!

1130
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:31,540
I got...

1131
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,340
Bro, there was three people!

1132
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,280
Did anyone get the license plate?

1133
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,680
It's not fair!

1134
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,360
There was like three!

1135
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,000
I'm one Tracer.

1136
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,680
Oh my god.

1137
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,900
Why is it all Kirikos?

1138
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:47,540
Please.

1139
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,860
Is it just Kirikos?

1140
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,940
Where the fuck is the Widow?

1141
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,620
Let me farm this Widow.

1142
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:55,500
Okay.

1143
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:56,820
Oh, I hear him.

1144
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:56,880
Okay.

1145
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,960
Bro, stop following me!

1146
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,280
Bro, leave me alone!

1147
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,300
Farm somebody else!

1148
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,040
Where is this Widow?

1149
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,860
I'm going to try to...

1150
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,700
Oh, there he is.

1151
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:14,660
Please!

1152
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,200
Let me farm this Widow!

1153
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,280
Oh my god, it's worth it.

1154
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,440
It's worth it.

1155
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:26,860
It's worth it.

1156
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,180
That's it.

1157
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,020
Bro, it's not my fault!

1158
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,900
I literally have like three people on my ass!

1159
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,300
Bro, bitch!

1160
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,220
Bro, fuck off!

1161
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,780
I fucking farmed her!

1162
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,620
Leave me alone!

1163
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,240
Okay, where's the widow?

1164
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,320
I won't make that widow leave.

1165
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:49,620
Right here.

1166
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:51,920
Okay.

1167
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:04,060
Baby?

1168
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:04,440
There you go!

1169
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,080
Fuck off!

1170
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,400
Oh fuck!

1171
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:07,800
Okay.

1172
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:08,900
Give me a sec.

1173
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,040
Give me a sec.

1174
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,760
Give me a sec!

1175
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,360
All right!

1176
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,300
Don't worry!

1177
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,400
Bro, what the fuck this Kiriko is just annoying us!

1178
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:20,060
There you go.

1179
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,960
They don't know, they don't know.

1180
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,260
Oh god!

1181
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:25,960
Oh god!

1182
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,240
They don't know.

1183
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,260
I don't know how I'm here.

1184
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,980
I need to regen because I don't know where the health packs are.

1185
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,180
I don't know where the health packs are!

1186
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:35,800
Bro!

1187
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,280
Okay!

1188
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,440
Okay, nice.

1189
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,740
I got the Kiriko kill.

1190
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,480
She's just watching!

1191
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:45,820
It made me... It gave me performance anxiety when he just started watching!

1192
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,200
I don't know what to do!

1193
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,420
Oh, thank god.

1194
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,080
It's okay.

1195
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,720
We in the game.

1196
00:51:58,820 --> 00:51:59,860
We in the game!

1197
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,840
Actually a hunting party.

1198
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,700
They were judging me!

1199
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,140
They were looking at me!

1200
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,660
It happens to all of us.

1201
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,480
Can I play Mercy?

1202
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:18,200
Am I... Guys, do I get my one?

1203
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,420
My one Mercy game?

1204
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,400
Yes.

1205
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,060
Have I been...

1206
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,180
Have I proven myself enough to have one Mercy game?

1207
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:39,140
Look, I get... I get one mistake and one Mercy game.

1208
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,380
Do I... Can I... Do I not... Can I not try anymore?

1209
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,820
Mercy is cracked now.

1210
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,520
You say that and then you get like...

1211
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,360
You get like two guys yelling at you because you're playing Mercy.

1212
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,320
You say...

1213
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,900
You're playing Mercy would be the mistake.

1214
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,500
Guys, sometimes a support player just want to play Mercy.

1215
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,400
Okay?

1216
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,860
They just want to play Mercy and just relax.

1217
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:07,680
Alright, guys?

1218
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,000
I need you to know that...

1219
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,800
That sometimes people just don't want to aim.

1220
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,080
And that's why Mercy and Brigitte was born.

1221
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,460
Yeah, Widow.

1222
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,020
That's why I don't... I personally don't like this map if they have a good Widow.

1223
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,140
Oh.

1224
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:22,720
Over there.

1225
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:24,780
Oh.

1226
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,280
Oh, he fucking dead.

1227
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,020
Okay, I should play Kiriko.

1228
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,540
I'll save the Doom and then I'm gonna swap the Kiriko.

1229
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,240
Because we need cleanse.

1230
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,360
Alright.

1231
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,880
Guys, it's not because we were losing.

1232
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,700
It just makes sense to play Kiriko.

1233
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,020
Okay, guys?

1234
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,980
Sometimes I play Kiriko because it makes sense.

1235
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,400
Alright.

1236
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,520
He was just pepper spraying me so I was just like... whatever.

1237
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:01,940
Guys, there are moments when I pick her because she just was the character to play.

1238
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,480
Alright, we're fine.

1239
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,560
We're fine.

1240
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,740
Even if we lose, we have a demotion protection.

1241
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,420
Oh my god, please.

1242
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:14,800
Please.

1243
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,600
Do one damage.

1244
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,080
Oh, god.

1245
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:20,980
It's fine.

1246
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:21,660
I'm alive.

1247
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:22,300
I'm alive.

1248
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,940
I am not alive anymore.

1249
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:25,940
I'm alive.

1250
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,980
Please tell me you're not Doom 1 Trick.

1251
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,620
Please tell me you're not Doom 1 Trick.

1252
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:35,300
Because we really need you to be somebody else.

1253
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,020
They are hard countering you, my dude.

1254
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,080
They are hard countering you.

1255
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,080
Oh, thank god.

1256
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:46,360
Oh, thank god.

1257
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,260
Okay, they missed.

1258
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,900
Are you serious?

1259
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,360
Okay, that was a mistake.

1260
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,440
I swear to god.

1261
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,320
Please just be alive.

1262
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:02,540
This is all I want.

1263
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,240
Be alive.

1264
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,820
He has ult.

1265
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,240
Winston has ult.

1266
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:07,460
Winston...

1267
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,540
Why are you there?

1268
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,100
Why are you there?

1269
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,700
Oh, Dooms are...

1270
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,480
Not anymore.

1271
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,740
There's just Dooms that like...

1272
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:18,400
Okay.

1273
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:18,640
Okay.

1274
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:20,860
Alright.

1275
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:21,600
They wasted that.

1276
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,160
That's good.

1277
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,240
That's good.

1278
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,140
They wasted the ult.

1279
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,140
They wasted the ult.

1280
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:26,520
We're fine.

1281
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,080
Yeah, there's structures there now.

1282
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:31,780
There's new stuff.

1283
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,380
There's so many new things.

1284
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:38,980
It's okay.

1285
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:39,820
It's okay.

1286
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,340
Maybe our Doom...

1287
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,040
Maybe our Doom will swap.

1288
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,080
Oh, thank fucking god.

1289
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,060
I honestly never expected him to swap.

1290
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:47,780
But thank god.

1291
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,360
Also, nobody talks in Overwatch anymore.

1292
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,520
It's actually sad.

1293
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,820
Everyone just plays the game.

1294
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,700
There you go.

1295
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,560
That's how you headshot.

1296
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,580
Wait, I think he still has ult.

1297
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,460
I don't think he expected to get burned that quickly.

1298
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:03,860
Look at that.

1299
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,040
Look at that headshot.

1300
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,800
Whoa, look at that.

1301
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,840
That was not a headshot.

1302
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,780
But look at that though.

1303
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,540
Jesus Christ, please.

1304
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,160
There's too many flankers.

1305
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:14,840
Okay.

1306
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:16,660
Alright.

1307
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:17,040
I'm gonna go.

1308
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,620
I think I can kill him.

1309
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:19,680
No one.

1310
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,020
Nope.

1311
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:20,440
Nope.

1312
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:20,840
Nope.

1313
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,280
Nope.

1314
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:21,740
Nope.

1315
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,900
Are you serious?

1316
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,720
Sometimes there's too many things.

1317
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,720
I can't fucking do everything.

1318
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:35,880
It's fine.

1319
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:37,260
We're okay.

1320
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:37,960
Please.

1321
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:38,740
Please.

1322
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,360
Anybody.

1323
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:42,960
Please.

1324
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,540
I'm about to be at 2k damage.

1325
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:48,660
I mean, at the same damage as our Sombra.

1326
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,020
It's okay.

1327
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:54,960
As long as I don't publicly say the toxic stuff to them, we're fine.

1328
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,260
Like, how trash this Tracer is.

1329
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,760
He should uninstall this game right now.

1330
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,800
But it's okay.

1331
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,480
Please.

1332
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,140
Bap.

1333
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,540
I'm a team.

1334
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,500
Oh my god.

1335
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,660
It's okay.

1336
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,280
We have rank insurance later.

1337
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,400
Look.

1338
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:29,100
It's not me that I have a 30% win rate.

1339
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:37,240
It's not my fault that I have a 30% win rate on Kiriko.

1340
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,200
It's just...

1341
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,080
It's unwinnable.

1342
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,420
I'm in an unwinnable scenario.

1343
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,520
I'm in a win-win situation.

1344
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,300
I'm letting...

1345
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,000
He's only 14 years old.

1346
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:55,720
Look.

1347
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,460
I swear to god.

1348
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,180
It's not a me issue when it comes to Kiriko.

1349
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,480
I swear to god.

1350
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:08,500
My team...

1351
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,500
My team is just...

1352
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:16,740
Let's just say...

1353
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,720
Let's just say they could be held back a grade.

1354
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:20,600
Let's just say that.

1355
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:27,000
I'm out here skipping five grades.

1356
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,060
My teammates are still fucking in kindergarten.

1357
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:32,900
Like...

1358
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:34,800
Look.

1359
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,380
You can't blame me.

1360
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:36,960
I have the...

1361
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,140
Wait.

1362
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:37,660
Shit.

1363
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,400
This character...

1364
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:38,820
Never mind.

1365
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,460
I don't have my sprays on this guy.

1366
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:45,620
That's a nice way to say it.

1367
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:46,340
Look.

1368
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,160
Guys.

1369
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,520
I'm PMA.

1370
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:49,840
Positive mental attitude.

1371
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,900
Positive mental attitude chat.

1372
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,840
It's all about being positive.

1373
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:55,700
Yeah.

1374
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:57,640
Yeah.

1375
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,140
Okay.

1376
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,400
How much you want?

1377
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,300
I'm gonna run up this wall and then get headshot.

1378
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:03,120
Nope.

1379
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,260
I didn't.

1380
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,400
Thank fucking god.

1381
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:06,960
Thank god.

1382
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,700
I had somebody...

1383
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:09,880
I had somebody...

1384
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:09,920
I had somebody...

1385
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:20,200
I had one of my friends call me like a heal bot on Kiriko because all I do was like heal instead of like DPSing.

1386
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:25,920
And then I like 1v1 them on Kiriko and then I fucking shit on them.

1387
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,680
We did like...

1388
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,860
We had like a 1v1 session on Kiriko and I had like...

1389
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,720
I think it was like 20 to 10.

1390
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,120
I was like, say that shit again.

1391
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,540
I was like, fuck you.

1392
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:47,620
Who said I'm a heal bot on Kiriko?

1393
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,640
It's not my fault that my team keeps fucking dying so I can't DPS.

1394
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,940
Like it's not my fault.

1395
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:04,560
Okay.

1396
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:04,800
Look.

1397
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,220
That...

1398
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:05,560
Okay.

1399
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,860
I might have missed shots there.

1400
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,040
But like...

1401
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,200
Is that what I'm saying?

1402
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:12,880
There we go.

1403
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,360
This is different.

1404
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:14,560
This is different.

1405
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:15,700
The strafe was insane.

1406
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,240
The strafe pattern was insane.

1407
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:22,840
It's different.

1408
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:25,980
I'm not a heal bot on Kiriko.

1409
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:27,220
All right.

1410
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,060
I can also DPS too.

1411
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,640
But like I need to win the game so I can't fucking try to prove a point at the moment because I need to make sure my team's alive.

1412
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:39,280
Like I said, it's not my fault that I'm healing so much on Kiriko.

1413
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:39,880
I'm going to do it.

1414
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,120
I have to keep them alive!

1415
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:45,180
Look!

1416
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:46,620
I have to keep them alive!

1417
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,880
Oh my god, I swear, please poke.

1418
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,140
Please, I need heals.

1419
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,980
Please, don't let this monkey kill me!

1420
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,920
Don't let this monkey kill me!

1421
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,180
Alright, there you go.

1422
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,280
Anyway...

1423
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,080
Panzer, thank you for the 50k!

1424
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,260
Thank you!

1425
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,560
Okay, that's fine.

1426
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:14,720
Alright.

1427
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:16,960
Making sure you're alive.

1428
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,300
Making sure you're alive too.

1429
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:22,840
Alright, there you go.

1430
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,220
You forgot!

1431
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,360
Alright, we're fine.

1432
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:32,620
We're fine.

1433
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:35,720
See?

1434
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,420
Headshot!

1435
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:37,360
Boom!

1436
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,160
Climb the wall!

1437
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:40,220
Headshot!

1438
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:41,160
Boom!

1439
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:42,740
There you go.

1440
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:43,680
Easy.

1441
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,740
Oh god.

1442
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,000
Oh... Oh god.

1443
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,680
Oh god!

1444
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:50,420
Alright, we're fine.

1445
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,060
Everything is okay.

1446
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:58,400
Everything... We're totally gonna lose this.

1447
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,280
We're...

1448
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,680
I actually have...

1449
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,540
Wait!

1450
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,720
No, we're totally gonna lose this.

1451
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,600
I'm going in with zero confidence here.

1452
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,420
I... I honestly do not...

1453
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,040
I do not think that this is winnable.

1454
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,800
Unless... I do have my rush!

1455
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,180
Yeah, Masters is top 500 now.

1456
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,360
If you're in Diamond, I think Masters is Diamond 5.

1457
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,800
Or Diamond... Not Diamond 5.

1458
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,120
Diamond... Diamond 1?

1459
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:31,840
Maybe?

1460
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,300
Maybe Diamond 1?

1461
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,800
It's okay!

1462
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,220
I'm protecting you!

1463
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:41,700
Everything will be fine!

1464
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,060
Are you fucking...

1465
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,780
I... I can't believe it!

1466
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,900
My rush got fucking eliminated!

1467
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:55,080
My rush actually got eliminated by a hack!

1468
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,400
Oh god, this might be where I die.

1469
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,100
This might be where I die.

1470
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,420
Let them out!

1471
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:05,540
Oh god.

1472
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:06,660
Oh...

1473
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:09,720
I'm that good.

1474
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:10,460
I didn't need rush.

1475
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,600
I'm so good that I don't even need rush!

1476
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,400
You got this!

1477
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:17,620
Guys!

1478
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,600
Who the fuck needs rush?

1479
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,400
I'm that good!

1480
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,900
Never judge me!

1481
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:23,580
I have to...

1482
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:24,620
Okay, don't look at this, though.

1483
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,620
Don't look at this.

1484
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,760
Look at the heals.

1485
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,160
I am not a heal bot.

1486
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,840
I am not a heal bot.

1487
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,580
But I kept my team alive.

1488
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,500
I'm the same!

1489
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,560
I'm not a heal bot on Kiriko.

1490
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,560
Guys, I'm not a heal bot on Kiriko.

1491
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,260
I had more damage than our Bap on Kiriko.

1492
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,720
That's so different!

1493
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:52,280
It's okay.

1494
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,500
We have rank insurance now.

1495
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,260
We have rank insurance.

1496
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,040
We don't...

1497
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,020
We don't talk about...

1498
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,200
our fucking accuracy.

1499
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,060
Not a heal bot.

1500
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,080
Look at this.

1501
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,140
That's different!

1502
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:14,640
I had to heal that much because my team was dying!

1503
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:18,960
Look, we're slowly but surely raising our Kiriko win rate.

1504
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:19,680
Guys.

1505
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,480
Welcome back to Tamaya Farm!

1506
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:26,220
Welcome back!

1507
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:28,660
Straight, thank you for the super chat.

1508
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:29,460
Thank you, thank you.

1509
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,180
Guys, guys.

1510
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:30,920
Okay, look.

1511
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,960
In Overwatch, it's actually not a compliment what I found out.

1512
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:35,400
Like...

1513
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:39,580
How do I know?

1514
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:43,500
I've surprisingly been called a heal bot on Kiriko.

1515
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:44,400
Not...

1516
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,760
Not just once.

1517
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:46,780
Like...

1518
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:50,840
It was like, heal bot quote unquote derogatory.

1519
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:55,960
So I...

1520
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:02,560
So unfortunately, that's how I know the heal bot is not the way to go.

1521
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:05,500
Why is it that bad?

1522
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:07,800
Because when you're playing Kiriko, the issue...

1523
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:12,860
You're supposed to put in the DPS as well when you're playing Kiriko too.

1524
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,280
But like, I...

1525
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:15,300
Apparently, I...

1526
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:15,840
I...

1527
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:16,880
I...

1528
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:22,640
Do not put in enough DPS for them to be happy about it.

1529
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:22,720
Yo, yo, yo!

1530
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,840
How you guys doing?

1531
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,420
Holy shit!

1532
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,160
He's loud.

1533
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,000
Give me a sec.

1534
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:28,520
We're gonna...

1535
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,280
Can I...

1536
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,400
I'm gonna have to adjust the fucking thing.

1537
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,260
Alright, give me a sec.

1538
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,280
We gotta adjust...

1539
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,320
How do you adjust the fucking vol...

1540
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,700
Is there like individual volume sliders?

1541
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,180
Oh my god, that's so loud.

1542
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:43,980
Oh my god.

1543
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:44,620
Okay, wait.

1544
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:45,540
Uh...

1545
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,480
Voice chat.

1546
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:49,040
Oh, is it cause like voice chat volume is like at...

1547
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,500
I'm putting at 75.

1548
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:51,620
There we go.

1549
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,320
Guys, I'm not throwing.

1550
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:55,200
I'm not throwing.

1551
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,260
It's my time.

1552
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,080
Wait, I'm a Sombra?

1553
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:00,460
Oh my god, okay.

1554
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,700
There's no reason to play Mercy with Sombra, Tracer, with two flankers.

1555
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,800
There's no reason.

1556
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,040
Guys, I'm not picking Kiriko.

1557
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,160
I'm not picking Kiriko because I'm throwing.

1558
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,120
Okay.

1559
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:20,720
It's cause...

1560
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,120
Cop wise, I have to.

1561
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,420
Sometimes you just have to play these characters.

1562
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:28,780
But it doesn't mean you're throwing.

1563
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:29,340
Thank you.

1564
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,280
It's just not...

1565
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,920
Oh, please, Ruben.

1566
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:35,880
You are my rank insurance.

1567
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:41,980
If I start losing without rank insurance, what does that say about my insurance?

1568
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:46,600
Okay.

1569
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:47,780
All right.

1570
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,640
Okay, we have Ana.

1571
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,040
Okay, we have two flankers.

1572
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,280
You can't blame my team.

1573
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,080
Everybody's playing...

1574
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,400
Everybody playing Ana.

1575
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,560
We're playing the required character.

1576
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,020
Except for our DPS, which is unfortunately like, you know, what we need good DPS.

1577
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,220
I should have avoided Sombra.

1578
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,140
I should have avoided Sombra.

1579
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:09,920
There's rank insurance now?

1580
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,580
Yes, my rank insurance is called having a duo.

1581
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:15,380
That's my rank insurance.

1582
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,740
Look, I did have a pause...

1583
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:21,300
Woo!

1584
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:22,940
Woo!

1585
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,700
Is he still holding it?

1586
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:25,520
He's still holding it.

1587
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,380
Is my head peaking?

1588
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:27,380
We're fine.

1589
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:27,820
We're fine.

1590
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:28,260
See?

1591
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:29,660
We're okay.

1592
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:31,700
We're okay.

1593
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:32,800
All right.

1594
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,380
We're all here.

1595
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:34,120
Look.

1596
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:35,300
Oh my God.

1597
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:35,740
Thank God.

1598
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,720
He's playing Soldier now.

1599
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,120
Oh, thank God.

1600
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:38,500
Okay.

1601
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:39,380
All right.

1602
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,620
And then he died, but that's okay.

1603
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:44,600
It's okay.

1604
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:45,340
He's dead.

1605
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,220
But like...

1606
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:46,620
Okay.

1607
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,280
All right.

1608
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,500
This is fine.

1609
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:52,320
They used copy and they used rush.

1610
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:53,520
All right.

1611
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,440
I think I won more being solo.

1612
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:55,500
I think I won more being solo.

1613
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,180
I'm just...

1614
01:07:56,180 --> 01:08:01,280
All I'm saying is that I won more games playing solo.

1615
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,620
You'll be able to walk out of spawn.

1616
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:04,200
It'll be beautiful.

1617
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:09,580
All right.

1618
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,240
Wait.

1619
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:12,480
I think I can like chill now.

1620
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:13,840
We have Ana.

1621
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:14,840
We have Soldier.

1622
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,120
And we have Ashe.

1623
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:17,380
Nice.

1624
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,380
All right.

1625
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:19,360
This is it.

1626
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:21,780
Use my rush so I can swap later.

1627
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:22,820
All right.

1628
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:23,320
It's okay.

1629
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:24,400
It's just on Ruben.

1630
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:25,400
It's fine.

1631
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:25,480
It's fine.

1632
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:25,700
Look at that.

1633
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:26,000
He's fine.

1634
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,240
Look, he's so healthy.

1635
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,760
Look, he's so healthy.

1636
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:29,900
Look at that.

1637
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:30,860
He took two...

1638
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,180
Oh, and then our Soldier died.

1639
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:33,860
Oh, and then our other DPS died.

1640
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:34,280
Okay.

1641
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,800
This just wasn't the game.

1642
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,320
This is just not the game.

1643
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:44,440
This is just...

1644
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:49,500
It's all right.

1645
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:50,920
We're just...

1646
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,740
We were not meant to win this.

1647
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,500
It was canon.

1648
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,180
It was fucking...

1649
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,060
It was just canon.

1650
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,180
It was just...

1651
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:07,800
No, he's not!

1652
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:14,340
Words are his?

1653
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,660
What do you mean words are his?

1654
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,800
What do you mean?

1655
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:21,460
Okay.

1656
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,620
All I'm saying is that...

1657
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:29,040
The rank insurance kicks in now.

1658
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,120
It kicks in.

1659
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:40,300
The rank insurance, it's gonna kick in now.

1660
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,280
I would type where the DPS at.

1661
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,120
Look, I would too.

1662
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:53,680
But I'm also afraid of getting...

1663
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,800
I'm getting banned.

1664
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:03,320
Because they're very strict now about banning people.

1665
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:09,820
They're very strict now and I don't want to get chat banned.

1666
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,720
Guys, I really do not want to get chat banned.

1667
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,120
Even for like stuff like...

1668
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,320
Guys, I get one!

1669
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,000
Guys!

1670
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:22,060
I get one game!

1671
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,700
My one game of Mercy.

1672
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,900
Like how every game I get one...

1673
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:34,640
Like how every game I get like one mistake.

1674
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:39,500
Every three games I get one chance to play Mercy.

1675
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:44,090
Oh my god.

1676
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:46,930
Dude, I'm so ready to win.

1677
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:50,350
First game of the day feeling fresh and ready.

1678
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:52,970
Wait, wait.

1679
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:55,610
Wait, wait.

1680
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:57,930
Why would you ask that?

1681
01:10:58,230 --> 01:10:58,490
Why would you ask that?

1682
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:03,330
You clearly missed a payment on your rank insurance.

1683
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,290
Don't worry, I got you.

1684
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:06,350
Don't keep faking.

1685
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:07,690
Thank you for the Akka super.

1686
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:08,490
Thank you.

1687
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:08,890
Thank you.

1688
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:09,510
You're right.

1689
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:10,130
You're right, Bacon.

1690
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:11,970
My rank insurance starts now.

1691
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:14,450
It starts now.

1692
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:15,850
This is where it starts.

1693
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:19,330
My one game on Mercy.

1694
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:19,670
Where is the other seat?

1695
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:24,270
It will be fine.

1696
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:26,310
Where am I?

1697
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:27,070
Oh there it is.

1698
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:27,790
Oh run!

1699
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:29,070
Oh this is so easy!

1700
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:31,150
This is so easy!

1701
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:35,090
They are on run!

1702
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:38,190
That's like automatically easy game.

1703
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:40,590
Okay.

1704
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:43,210
Okay I sort of threw there.

1705
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:50,490
Okay.

1706
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:52,170
Okay I threw a little bit.

1707
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:53,630
But like it was a joke.

1708
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,050
It was like...

1709
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:56,510
It was just a joke guys.

1710
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,110
Alright focus now!

1711
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:01,810
Focus now!

1712
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:02,690
Guys.

1713
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:05,130
I'm not pistolling because I'm throwing.

1714
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:07,750
I'm pistolling because I want to get the Zenyatta out of the way.

1715
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:10,390
Oh god please Livanna.

1716
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:12,010
Please fucking Liv.

1717
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:13,550
Okay here we go.

1718
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:14,210
Here we go.

1719
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:14,630
See?

1720
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:15,190
Fine.

1721
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:15,750
We're fine.

1722
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:18,790
Look!

1723
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:19,250
Look!

1724
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:21,290
I'll swap after my ult!

1725
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:21,790
Okay!

1726
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:25,610
Here.

1727
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:26,530
Watch this.

1728
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:30,010
Look at all the...

1729
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:33,210
That means my DPS is doing great.

1730
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:35,550
The most engaging gameplay ever.

1731
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:40,810
Here we go.

1732
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:41,470
Come on!

1733
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:42,070
Get a kill!

1734
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:43,130
You got this!

1735
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:44,910
Ohhhh!

1736
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:46,950
Okay.

1737
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:47,870
Okay.

1738
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:50,290
That's fine.

1739
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:52,030
See?

1740
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:53,370
Now you get your kill.

1741
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:54,350
Now you get your one.

1742
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:57,250
You get your one right here.

1743
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:58,950
Right here!

1744
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:00,230
That's right!

1745
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:01,170
That's right small pup!

1746
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:03,550
You get your one kill right here!

1747
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:06,410
Right here is where you get your one kill!

1748
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:08,210
This is it small pup!

1749
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:10,030
I won't stop healing you until...

1750
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:11,190
Small pup please!

1751
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:12,370
Oh he did it.

1752
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:13,210
She did it.

1753
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:14,410
She did it.

1754
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:19,310
She fucking killed it.

1755
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:20,370
She fucking did it.

1756
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:21,830
She fucking did it.

1757
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:22,230
I believed.

1758
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:25,410
What was that?

1759
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:26,530
What is this guy doing?

1760
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:27,050
Oh my god.

1761
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:27,310
Wait.

1762
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:28,470
There we go.

1763
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:30,250
It's fine!

1764
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:33,070
The hero we all deserved.

1765
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:34,770
She got her one kill.

1766
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:35,930
We did it.

1767
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:38,130
Now I don't have the damage booster anymore.

1768
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:39,650
Oh my god.

1769
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:40,790
He's so... Is Ruben okay?

1770
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:41,930
I'm not okay.

1771
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:43,050
I am not okay.

1772
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:43,850
Oh my god!

1773
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:44,430
Two kills!

1774
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:46,330
I've never doubted you.

1775
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:48,790
Never doubted you for a second.

1776
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:50,910
What the fuck was that Rineshatter?

1777
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:52,430
It was called Optimism.

1778
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:55,590
Oh she is so fucking dead.

1779
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:58,210
She is so fucking dead.

1780
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:01,550
She is so fucking dead.

1781
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:01,710
She is so...

1782
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:01,710
No!

1783
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:03,590
Just needed one poke!

1784
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:06,590
Just one fucking poke man!

1785
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:07,010
Just one fucking poke man!

1786
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:07,510
Oh my god.

1787
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:08,690
That tracking is beautiful though.

1788
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:09,590
Please.

1789
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:10,870
Please.

1790
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:12,550
Just one poke.

1791
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:14,010
Oh my god.

1792
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:14,630
I'm taking a nap.

1793
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:17,890
Alright.

1794
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:18,610
It's fine.

1795
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:18,950
Alright.

1796
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:18,950
It's fine.

1797
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:20,610
I will rez her.

1798
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,650
And then nothing bad happens.

1799
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:25,890
Yo we can kill Bastion!

1800
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:26,850
Alright.

1801
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:28,730
We can also kill Ana.

1802
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:29,750
See?

1803
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:31,250
It'll be fine.

1804
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:31,490
It's okay.

1805
01:14:31,490 --> 01:14:32,210
I'll meet shield you.

1806
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:33,050
You won't die on my watch.

1807
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:33,910
I can kill this guy.

1808
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:36,610
He's getting healed?

1809
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:37,550
What is going on over there?

1810
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:40,350
How is he getting healed passively?

1811
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:42,270
Why is there a rogue over here?

1812
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:43,410
I shot him!

1813
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:45,290
How did the regen...

1814
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:45,710
Pit.

1815
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:47,070
Okay.

1816
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:47,690
We're fine.

1817
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:48,030
Okay.

1818
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:48,510
That's fine.

1819
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:48,850
Later.

1820
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:49,410
See?

1821
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:50,410
We're in the...

1822
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:53,850
We're in a stage of it's fine and it's not fine.

1823
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:55,490
But it'll be fine.

1824
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:56,610
They have no sleep.

1825
01:14:58,250 --> 01:14:59,210
Oh no.

1826
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:01,050
Oh no.

1827
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:03,150
It's not fine anymore.

1828
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:03,870
I'm swapping.

1829
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:05,950
There's no reason to play her.

1830
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:06,430
I win these.

1831
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:07,610
That's the crazy thing.

1832
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:08,550
Alright.

1833
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:09,110
Let's see.

1834
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:09,910
I'm gonna play...

1835
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:12,430
I'm gonna play Kiriko.

1836
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:15,690
We need Kiriko for the laning phase.

1837
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:16,150
It's always about the cleanse, guys.

1838
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:18,170
It's always about the cleanse.

1839
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:22,170
It's so over him.

1840
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:23,230
We're so back.

1841
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:25,230
We need to get rid of antis.

1842
01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:28,910
We're gonna up our win percentage on this character.

1843
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:31,710
Guys.

1844
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:32,830
It's gonna work.

1845
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:35,830
We're gonna up our win percentage.

1846
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:39,250
What the fuck?

1847
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:39,950
He's like 1.

1848
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:42,250
Holy shit.

1849
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:44,970
I am just gonna watch.

1850
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:46,170
I'm gonna wait here.

1851
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:49,210
Is he fine?

1852
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:51,050
Is he fine?

1853
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:53,190
I don't think he's fine.

1854
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:55,890
I don't think he was fine.

1855
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:00,370
That means because I refunded my Mercy.

1856
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:02,470
Because I refunded my Mercy.

1857
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:05,330
That means I get to play Mercy next game.

1858
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:05,790
That means I get to play Mercy next game.

1859
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:07,630
Because I did a refund and got my money back.

1860
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:09,230
So I have one refund.

1861
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:12,610
Okay.

1862
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:13,370
Thank you.

1863
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:14,490
That's how it works.

1864
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:18,570
That's how it works.

1865
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:19,390
I got my money back.

1866
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:20,530
And I got a refund.

1867
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:23,090
Refund is guaranteed.

1868
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:24,770
We're gonna kill the Soge.

1869
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:26,470
I'm gonna shit my pants.

1870
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:27,850
Is he okay?

1871
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:29,190
Dude.

1872
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:29,930
I know.

1873
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:32,970
Poor guy.

1874
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:34,270
That's what I'm talking about.

1875
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:35,890
Alright.

1876
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:39,350
I did not wake him up.

1877
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:40,810
Everybody else woke him up.

1878
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:42,390
Guys.

1879
01:16:42,530 --> 01:16:43,110
It wasn't me.

1880
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:45,050
Oh wait.

1881
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:45,770
Oh my god.

1882
01:16:46,130 --> 01:16:47,070
They're getting kills.

1883
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:48,370
Go.

1884
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:48,630
Go.

1885
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:48,830
Go.

1886
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:50,270
Where is the...

1887
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:54,390
Where is the Hammond?

1888
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:55,350
I can't see the Hammond.

1889
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:57,850
Nice.

1890
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:01,570
Please.

1891
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:02,730
Just shoot him.

1892
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:03,950
Shoot him.

1893
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,150
He's so low.

1894
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:08,910
Oh my god.

1895
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:10,670
Thank god.

1896
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:12,430
At least shoot him.

1897
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:16,830
Please shoot him too.

1898
01:17:17,650 --> 01:17:18,090
No.

1899
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:18,470
Okay.

1900
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:19,030
We're good.

1901
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:19,770
We're good.

1902
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:21,130
This is happening.

1903
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:24,210
I told you.

1904
01:17:25,070 --> 01:17:25,510
Look.

1905
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:27,130
Maybe Mercy was just not the pick.

1906
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:28,130
Guys.

1907
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:31,710
Maybe Mercy was like 100% not the pick.

1908
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:33,710
Maybe Mercy was like 100% not the pick.

1909
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:34,550
He's slamming me.

1910
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:35,510
We're gonna kill the Loaded.

1911
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:37,930
I'm not sure yet.

1912
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:38,530
I'm not sure yet.

1913
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:39,190
I need more data.

1914
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:40,330
I need more data.

1915
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:41,170
I need more data.

1916
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:43,670
I need more data.

1917
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:45,490
Just a maybe.

1918
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:47,930
Alright.

1919
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:49,510
We're fine.

1920
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:51,170
I have Rush.

1921
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:53,410
There.

1922
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:56,430
You're welcome Tracer.

1923
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:58,110
Now I never have to heal her again.

1924
01:17:58,370 --> 01:18:00,510
She can't complain because I saved her life one time.

1925
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:02,770
That's how it works.

1926
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:04,030
Being a support player.

1927
01:18:04,530 --> 01:18:05,010
Wait.

1928
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:05,590
What the fuck?

1929
01:18:07,870 --> 01:18:09,050
What the fuck?

1930
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:09,650
What the fuck?

1931
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:17,790
I'm not gonna look.

1932
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,950
Can we kill this Rodent?

1933
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:21,670
Look at this guy.

1934
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:21,970
Okay.

1935
01:18:21,970 --> 01:18:22,270
There we go.

1936
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:24,790
What the fuck was this Ana doing there?

1937
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:26,990
Not a heal bot.

1938
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:29,150
I have less damage than our Ana.

1939
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:30,870
But I was also playing.

1940
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:31,130
Wait.

1941
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:31,430
No.

1942
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:33,430
Of course I have less damage.

1943
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:34,530
I was playing fucking.

1944
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,790
I was playing fucking Mercy.

1945
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:40,370
I'm about to laugh at Ana.

1946
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:40,790
I'm about to laugh at Ana.

1947
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:43,070
What the

1948
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:46,960
fuck is this?

1949
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,900
That's embarrassing.

1950
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:51,640
Kill him now.

1951
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,100
No he didn't.

1952
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:53,580
Oh wait.

1953
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:55,800
I'm almost there.

1954
01:18:58,900 --> 01:18:59,580
There you go.

1955
01:18:59,620 --> 01:18:59,940
Headshot.

1956
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:00,680
We chill really low.

1957
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:02,820
Oh god.

1958
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:05,580
Okay.

1959
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:05,880
It's fine.

1960
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:06,480
It's fine.

1961
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:08,980
Oh it's not fine.

1962
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,320
I ran away.

1963
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:12,720
Oh no.

1964
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:15,140
It's okay.

1965
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,020
There we go.

1966
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:20,600
It's fine.

1967
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:21,520
I need my damage!

1968
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:27,400
Oh, there's our Reaper!

1969
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,920
It's fine, we're okay.

1970
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:40,780
Just like Tanimura all over again.

1971
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,860
All I'm saying, chat...

1972
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:45,040
All I'm saying...

1973
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,060
is that...

1974
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:49,980
I was Mercy for like 60% of that game.

1975
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:53,900
And I'm already almost the same damage as our Ana.

1976
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:55,780
That's all I'm saying!

1977
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,980
I'm not saying that our Ana was bad!

1978
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,800
I'm saying that I'm really good.

1979
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,040
I'm just saying...

1980
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,320
I was pretty good with that fucking damage there.

1981
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:19,740
It's fine, it's fine.

1982
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,740
I think I'll play Zenyatta actually.

1983
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:23,820
Should I play Zen?

1984
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:24,540
Is it worth it?

1985
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:25,400
I'm gonna do it.

1986
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:26,380
I'm gonna do it.

1987
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,660
I'll play Kiriko if we die.

1988
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:35,520
It would be 30%!

1989
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,460
I literally swapped when we were here!

1990
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,380
That's like literally 60%!

1991
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,840
You see the chat for me?

1992
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:44,220
Did you call me for the new hero shooter Marvel?

1993
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,000
Yeah I did.

1994
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:54,060
And then I accidentally called the water guy Aquaman because I literally forgot the Marvel water guy.

1995
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:57,220
We need to switch that MV.

1996
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,060
I'm really excited though.

1997
01:20:58,340 --> 01:20:59,720
I'm really really excited.

1998
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:06,820
I'm really looking forward to it.

1999
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:09,440
We need like... I just want a fucking good FPS game.

2000
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,840
I'm tired of all the realism ones.

2001
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,440
What the fuck is he... WHAT?!

2002
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,100
He's like... Oookay.

2003
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,320
Alright.

2004
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:25,600
Okay.

2005
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:30,000
Wait, what?

2006
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,460
Yeah, our hog's dead.

2007
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:38,580
Our fucking tracer was AFK.

2008
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:44,960
I'm tired of all the realism shooters like the... the... what is it?

2009
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:47,280
Like the PUBGs and the Tarkovs.

2010
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,800
I just want like more of the non-realism shooters.

2011
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,700
Realism shooters just die so fast.

2012
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:56,100
It's just not fun for me.

2013
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:57,880
Why is there a floating orb?

2014
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:58,700
No!

2015
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:00,280
No!

2016
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:01,140
What?!

2017
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:03,040
The ride is a floating orb!

2018
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:05,780
I don't get it!

2019
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:07,460
I literally can't see the ride!

2020
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,380
I'm like... No!

2021
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:11,820
It's back!

2022
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:14,900
It's fine.

2023
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:17,140
The ride is a floating orb!

2024
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:21,440
I see the ride!

2025
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,500
I actually can't see the ride!

2026
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,080
What is this bug?!

2027
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:35,720
That bug only existed when my drives were crashing!

2028
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,900
Oh no...

2029
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,960
I actually can't see where the ride is.

2030
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,860
That's so bad.

2031
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:49,960
I'm sorry, I can't see the ride!

2032
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:51,840
Holy shit!

2033
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,740
I don't see this!

2034
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:55,560
What is this bug?!

2035
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,960
I haven't had that bug in so long!

2036
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,060
It's just orbs!

2037
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:02,920
We can also kill Rein.

2038
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:08,040
Oh, if I don't know where that ride is, I'm sorry!

2039
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,760
I'm sorry!

2040
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,720
I can't see him!

2041
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,620
I...

2042
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:13,740
Oh my god.

2043
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:14,380
Good job.

2044
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:17,940
That's a dead body.

2045
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:18,820
Okay, we know that.

2046
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,020
I can't... I actually don't know where...

2047
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:23,940
This is so bad.

2048
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:26,020
This is actually so bad.

2049
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:27,220
Oh my god.

2050
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:30,140
Okay...

2051
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,280
Oh no...

2052
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,900
I died!

2053
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:39,520
I'm gonna assume the Reinhardt is with the team, right?

2054
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,320
He has...

2055
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,620
He has to be with the team.

2056
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,420
He died a lot.

2057
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,480
That's the Rein!

2058
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:47,420
The tiny orb right here!

2059
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,580
That's him!

2060
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:51,480
Are you serious?

2061
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:54,460
Oh...

2062
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:58,500
Oh... He has played.

2063
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,160
He has played.

2064
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:00,860
He has played.

2065
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,660
He has played now.

2066
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,740
No, it's okay.

2067
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:05,500
That's fine.

2068
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,300
I got slushed by our fuckiana.

2069
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:09,220
Okay, I brought us Reinhardt.

2070
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:11,000
What the fuck is this bug?

2071
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,280
It's alright.

2072
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:13,520
This is...

2073
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,740
This is a little awkward.

2074
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,540
This is...

2075
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:20,220
Wait!

2076
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:22,020
I'm an orb too!

2077
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:24,900
Guys!

2078
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,820
Oh, the Rein!

2079
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,000
At least I can see the Rein now!

2080
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,680
I can see the Rein!

2081
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:37,920
It's fine!

2082
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,160
I can't see anything else!

2083
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,540
But I can see the Rein though!

2084
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:47,000
Genji, you can't die fast enough.

2085
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:49,420
You're a genius!

2086
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:50,680
It's okay!

2087
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,260
I can see the Rein now!

2088
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:54,040
Guys, I can see...

2089
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:54,660
Okay, I got my one.

2090
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,200
It's actually a really big one.

2091
01:24:58,340 --> 01:24:58,660
I'm ready.

2092
01:24:58,720 --> 01:24:59,320
Not overclocked.

2093
01:24:59,440 --> 01:24:59,820
Interesting.

2094
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,320
And they all just...

2095
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,720
Oh my god, I was gonna say...

2096
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:07,140
Guys, I don't think my rank insurance is working, guys.

2097
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:12,320
I realize my rank insurance is absolutely not working.

2098
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,220
I'm an orb!

2099
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,700
I'm an orb!

2100
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:24,760
I don't know what's going on!

2101
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,200
There's two orbs!

2102
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:30,760
Oh!

2103
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,100
We're all orbs!

2104
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:42,220
Guys, I'm losing with the rank insurance.

2105
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:45,180
I think I might need a refund.

2106
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,900
I might need a refund.

2107
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:50,060
My insurance has... I was winning more.

2108
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:54,140
As soon as I got rank insurance, I think I got sold a scam.

2109
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:57,600
Guys, as soon as I got rank insurance, I've been losing games.

2110
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:58,440
I...

2111
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:01,020
People are turning into orbs.

2112
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:01,960
Uh...

2113
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:06,380
Things...

2114
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:09,360
Things was not going so well for me.

2115
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,180
Oh my god, I see my hands!

2116
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:18,860
Holy shit!

2117
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:20,760
This is it!

2118
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,880
I can see my arms now!

2119
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,280
This is it!

2120
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:27,020
Alright.

2121
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,960
I'm not saying Ruben is scamming me!

2122
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,520
Guys, we've got a rock win and we win.

2123
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:34,700
That's it.

2124
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:35,920
I'm not saying.

2125
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,280
It's actually such a free game to fall down first place.

2126
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,560
Alright, let's... I hope I can see you right.

2127
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:45,500
I'm not gonna lose to a tank who's 14 and 10.

2128
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:47,320
Alright, here you go.

2129
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,440
I'm... I refuse...

2130
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:50,600
Here you go.

2131
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,580
I refuse to lose to that guy.

2132
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,460
To be fair, one of our tank... one of our DPS has like 11 deaths.

2133
01:26:58,540 --> 01:26:59,680
Alright, there you go.

2134
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:00,920
We're not orbs anymore.

2135
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:02,700
We're not orbs anymore.

2136
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:03,640
This is it.

2137
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,120
Guys, they're on Rein and Zen again.

2138
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:07,360
We're not orbs.

2139
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:10,300
But somebody's an orb.

2140
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:11,420
Alright.

2141
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:13,260
This is a little awkward.

2142
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,540
Oh, this is so awkward.

2143
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:18,640
Where is the Rein?

2144
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:20,000
What?

2145
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:20,400
Oh, my God.

2146
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,420
Where's the big, fucking fat Rein?

2147
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,680
I'm the most worried.

2148
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:32,320
I think the most worried part is...

2149
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,320
is I'm scared I'm fucking...

2150
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,620
I won't be able to see the pin.

2151
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:37,680
I...

2152
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:41,580
I will not be... I 100% will not be...

2153
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:42,460
I got my one.

2154
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:47,440
I definitely will not be able to see my fucking Rein.

2155
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:51,860
Wait, big, big, big.

2156
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,320
What's up?

2157
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:57,660
Someone else step on the point...

2158
01:27:57,660 --> 01:27:58,460
just don't see Rein.

2159
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:01,180
Oh, that's so easy.

2160
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:01,840
I'm here.

2161
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:01,840
I can see anywhere.

2162
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:02,660
Wait... I'm gonna go for the Ana.

2163
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:04,220
What are you...

2164
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:04,300
What are you...

2165
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:04,780
She's there.

2166
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,340
Where are you, Rupit?

2167
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:07,440
Where are you?

2168
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,020
What is this fucking bug?

2169
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:13,300
What?

2170
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:15,660
No.

2171
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:16,800
What is he?

2172
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:17,980
What is he?

2173
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:19,580
What hero is he playing?

2174
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:20,220
Okay, Doom.

2175
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:22,100
Okay, alright, Doom.

2176
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:22,880
Okay.

2177
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:35,000
Is that Ryne?

2178
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:35,940
That's Ryne.

2179
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:36,880
That's...

2180
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:44,340
Okay, I'm gonna hope everybody will be fine.

2181
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,900
Wait, what is that?

2182
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,640
What is that?

2183
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,360
Is that a Doom?

2184
01:28:49,560 --> 01:29:01,800
I might need to restart my game.

2185
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,720
Oh my god.

2186
01:29:11,050 --> 01:29:13,580
I can't even see the orb!

2187
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:14,640
What?

2188
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:17,700
I'm restarting game.

2189
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:19,720
Oh my god.

2190
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:22,340
I'm one game away from deraking!

2191
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:28,380
Okay.

2192
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,180
Alright, we're gonna restart.

2193
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:32,140
I don't know what happened.

2194
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,880
Honestly, I never...

2195
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:38,260
The last time this happened was like years ago.

2196
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:39,440
So...

2197
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,380
Battle of the goddamn orbs.

2198
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:44,320
Orbs.

2199
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:45,740
Overwatch joined now.

2200
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:46,540
Bro!

2201
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:53,060
I was just having too good of a good thing and then their game was like, you're having fun in Overwatch?

2202
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:54,400
I...

2203
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,680
Well then, Dokia.

2204
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,640
We're not gonna let you have that.

2205
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:03,680
There's an orb among us.

2206
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,800
They're just like, you're having good?

2207
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:11,220
You're having a good time?

2208
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,820
How dare you!

2209
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:21,180
Now here you can't see half of the players on this lobby.

2210
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,920
Overwatch 2 and fun can't be in the same set.

2211
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:28,920
How dare you start having fun on Overwatch.

2212
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:35,420
That was actually crazy.

2213
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:40,160
That actually like when the... when it was like a doom echo.

2214
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:43,920
When it was a doom echo, I literally could not see the doom.

2215
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:45,640
Like that was so big brain.

2216
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:49,580
That was actually so fucking big brain.

2217
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:50,400
Like...

2218
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:56,860
Like I can't believe it.

2219
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,660
I can't believe that happened.

2220
01:30:58,820 --> 01:30:59,780
That was actually crazy.

2221
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:01,920
Alright, here we go.

2222
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:03,680
We'll be fine.

2223
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:07,320
This time... this time guys, this is it.

2224
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:09,380
Overwatch 2.

2225
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,040
Okay, let me...

2226
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:13,480
Cause like my drives aren't... my drives are not crashing.

2227
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:14,380
I know that for sure.

2228
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:16,800
Cause like last time...

2229
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:22,620
Last time when we had orbs in Overwatch, it was cause like my PC was fucking dying.

2230
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,380
This is still not the...

2231
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:28,880
This is still... I'm not using my new PC yet cause I haven't had time to set up my new PC.

2232
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:30,220
But like okay.

2233
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:33,960
Your storage space... this is probably being used by something else.

2234
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:35,620
Check task manager.

2235
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:36,880
Oh no.

2236
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,840
How bad is my storage space right now?

2237
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,180
Can't be that bad.

2238
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:42,580
Yeah, it's not even that bad.

2239
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:46,180
It's not like my storage space is at 41%.

2240
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:46,980
What the fuck?

2241
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:51,040
I just hope my PC isn't... same thing happens.

2242
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:51,680
The mod up.

2243
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:52,980
Very common on my...

2244
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:53,800
Oh no.

2245
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:57,620
Is it... is it my game?

2246
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:02,240
Is it... is it my PC?

2247
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:02,760
We'll know.

2248
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:03,280
We'll know.

2249
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:04,480
We'll know if it's my PC.

2250
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:06,120
If everybody's orbs are getting here.

2251
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:09,380
But the thing is... I play so much... I think it's cause I'm streaming.

2252
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:11,800
Maybe it's cause I'm streaming that the games are getting rough.

2253
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:12,680
Like...

2254
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,080
Is it me?

2255
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,020
Am I the problem?

2256
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:25,020
Am I... Am I the issue here?

2257
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:26,200
Alright.

2258
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:26,740
No worry.

2259
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:27,680
We'll know.

2260
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:28,940
We'll know.

2261
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:31,340
I got my refund so I can play Mercy again.

2262
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:33,020
I got my refund guys.

2263
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:34,800
Is everybody loaded in?

2264
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,160
Everybody's loaded in.

2265
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:37,000
It was not me.

2266
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:37,820
It was the game.

2267
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:38,620
Look.

2268
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:38,820
See?

2269
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:40,500
What happened?

2270
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:41,280
Dude.

2271
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:41,600
Okay.

2272
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:42,860
This is my off wall man.

2273
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:43,240
Okay?

2274
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:43,560
It's...

2275
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:43,900
Look.

2276
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:44,660
See?

2277
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:45,520
See?

2278
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:48,480
There's a... There's... No orb.

2279
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:49,720
Wasn't me.

2280
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:51,220
It was not me.

2281
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:52,540
I fucking knew it wasn't me.

2282
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,120
I've always been a DPS player.

2283
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:54,760
It's never me.

2284
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:57,160
Archives.

2285
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:01,680
About checking the archives.

2286
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:04,180
It was not me.

2287
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:05,420
Good luck with that.

2288
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:07,420
It's okay.

2289
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:07,980
I can play.

2290
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:09,560
I can play Murky.

2291
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:11,920
Murky time.

2292
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:12,920
Yeah.

2293
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,000
Murky time.

2294
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,880
Yeah.

2295
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:20,500
Alright.

2296
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:23,740
It's time for relaxation after orb watch.

2297
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,780
It's orb watch time.

2298
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:30,840
Alright.

2299
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:31,700
Here we go.

2300
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:33,040
Look.

2301
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:33,320
See?

2302
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,280
So relaxing.

2303
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:38,580
Don't have to try.

2304
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:39,740
Just crouch.

2305
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:40,140
Woah!

2306
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:42,620
Sorry.

2307
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:43,700
Everything's fine.

2308
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:44,820
It was just a little scare.

2309
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,380
Just a little bit of a scare.

2310
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,120
Right here.

2311
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:51,020
See?

2312
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:52,360
Everything's okay.

2313
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:55,460
Alright, Ash.

2314
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:56,520
Go and do your thing.

2315
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,460
Let me hear the fucking...

2316
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:01,120
Let me hear the ting ting sounds.

2317
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:03,520
At least let me hear some headshots.

2318
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:04,640
That'd be crazy.

2319
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:05,180
Oh, wait.

2320
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:06,860
We can push this freely?

2321
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:08,400
You know what?

2322
01:34:08,420 --> 01:34:09,240
I'll take a free push.

2323
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:10,660
Don't!

2324
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:13,520
Okay.

2325
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:14,980
It wasn't as free as I thought.

2326
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:16,320
It wasn't.

2327
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:18,860
Guys.

2328
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:20,360
Apparently, it was not free.

2329
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:21,680
Of course.

2330
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:24,380
You don't get things in life for free.

2331
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:26,520
I forgot about that.

2332
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:27,080
Mercy.

2333
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:27,300
Mercy.

2334
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:27,600
Mercy.

2335
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:27,780
Mercy.

2336
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:27,900
Mercy.

2337
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:29,740
Kill their Mercy.

2338
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,040
If they can kill me, you can kill their Mercy.

2339
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:33,260
It's the rule of law.

2340
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:34,480
Where's the door?

2341
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,440
Thank you.

2342
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:35,980
There you go.

2343
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:36,540
I have Blade II.

2344
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:37,920
He has Blade!

2345
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,160
He's gaming!

2346
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:40,240
Alright.

2347
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:41,520
I believe in him.

2348
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:44,520
They remember the payload existed.

2349
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:49,160
Why do they always remember it at the worst possible moments for me?

2350
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:51,420
I think it's gonna be easy.

2351
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:53,880
I think they just hate YouTubers.

2352
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:54,620
They knew.

2353
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:55,340
They knew.

2354
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:55,800
They knew!

2355
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:58,600
Wait.

2356
01:34:58,600 --> 01:34:59,100
There's more.

2357
01:34:59,220 --> 01:34:59,540
Wait.

2358
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:00,380
Wait.

2359
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:00,500
Wait.

2360
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,100
Look.

2361
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:04,160
I'm getting targeted.

2362
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:08,100
All I'm saying is that I'm getting targeted right now.

2363
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:11,440
I'm getting targeted here.

2364
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:14,220
On LAN, I win those.

2365
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,100
Alright.

2366
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:15,920
This time.

2367
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:16,280
Okay.

2368
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:16,840
I'm gonna focus.

2369
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:18,160
I'm gonna focus.

2370
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:20,360
Guys.

2371
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:23,040
Guys.

2372
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:23,640
Look.

2373
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,320
All I'm saying is not me.

2374
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:27,140
I'm just getting targeted.

2375
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:29,320
I can't f***ing avoid forever.

2376
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:32,660
Stream sniping.

2377
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:34,060
Oh sh**.

2378
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:34,540
Stream sniping!

2379
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:39,440
I can't believe they would do this to banish Banshee.

2380
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:41,160
I can't believe it.

2381
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:43,700
They do this for the up and coming streamer Banshee.

2382
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:46,240
It's so f***ed up.

2383
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:47,740
Oh no.

2384
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,260
Oh no.

2385
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:49,660
It's okay.

2386
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:50,560
I can fly up in the air.

2387
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:52,900
Where?

2388
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:56,520
Where was my echo?

2389
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:57,920
Why do you care?

2390
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:00,460
Why?

2391
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:00,900
Why?

2392
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:03,900
Okay.

2393
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:09,180
My echo f***ing flew away from me and I couldn't fly up in the air.

2394
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:09,740
Yeah.

2395
01:36:10,230 --> 01:36:10,560
Yeah.

2396
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:11,440
Yeah.

2397
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:13,340
Yeah.

2398
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:15,120
Yeah.

2399
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:15,920
Yeah.

2400
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:16,520
Yeah.

2401
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:17,960
Yeah.

2402
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:18,220
Yeah.

2403
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:19,360
Yeah.

2404
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:23,760
Yeah.

2405
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:26,680
Yeah.

2406
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:27,840
Yeah.

2407
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:28,840
Yeah.

2408
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:30,440
Yeah.

2409
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:32,000
Holy sh**.

2410
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,740
All I'm saying is that I couldn't fly in the air.

2411
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:35,240
Okay.

2412
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:36,160
I couldn't fly.

2413
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:36,900
Why are you healing the hog?

2414
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:37,860
Oh my god.

2415
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:38,700
Yes.

2416
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:39,560
That could be pocket.

2417
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:40,700
Because I need healing.

2418
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:42,140
Wow.

2419
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:43,940
He has a single die.

2420
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:45,580
Guys.

2421
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:46,980
This is the Overwatch experience.

2422
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:47,760
Guys.

2423
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:48,720
Guys.

2424
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:52,720
I'm gonna report this guy and I hope he gets banned.

2425
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:53,500
Okay.

2426
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:54,380
No grass.

2427
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:55,060
Okay.

2428
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:55,260
Okay.

2429
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:55,980
No grass.

2430
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:56,480
Five points.

2431
01:36:57,660 --> 01:37:00,200
I f***ing healed as best as I could.

2432
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:01,000
In this scenario.

2433
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,520
I'm so good at plans, dude.

2434
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:04,640
I might be a genius.

2435
01:37:11,140 --> 01:37:11,660
Guys.

2436
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:12,680
It's not me.

2437
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:14,180
I swear to god.

2438
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:22,800
I swear to god.

2439
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:23,760
It's not me.

2440
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:28,080
Oh my god.

2441
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:32,760
Guys.

2442
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,120
This is why you don't play.

2443
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:34,940
This is why.

2444
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:35,980
Because you're not in voice.

2445
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:36,740
Mercy.

2446
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,040
I can say whatever you want about Kirit.

2447
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:38,640
I can't hear you.

2448
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:40,480
All I'm saying.

2449
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:46,740
All I'm saying is that playing Mercy is pretty rough.

2450
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:53,780
Look.

2451
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:54,720
It's my team.

2452
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:57,960
Mercy is only as good as the team.

2453
01:37:58,320 --> 01:37:58,800
Copy.

2454
01:37:58,800 --> 01:37:59,120
Copy.

2455
01:37:59,120 --> 01:37:59,460
Copy.

2456
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:06,440
I hope the echo dies.

2457
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:07,800
That's all I'm saying.

2458
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:13,320
I hope the echo dies.

2459
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:17,920
Holy sh**.

2460
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:19,120
I'm just getting targeted.

2461
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:22,120
I'm 100% getting targeted.

2462
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:23,220
There's no way.

2463
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:27,160
There's no way I die every time.

2464
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:28,040
Oh my god.

2465
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:31,160
They have nothing because they also just used high noon in the fight before.

2466
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:31,900
Oh.

2467
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:31,900
Wait.

2468
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:32,640
Did I like res that?

2469
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:33,760
Maybe I should res that.

2470
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:34,400
Should I wait?

2471
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:34,740
Nah.

2472
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:36,760
I'll just wait.

2473
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:37,960
Alright.

2474
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:40,420
I'm gonna go mid and I'm just gonna walk on this thing.

2475
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:42,580
I'll go do the echo.

2476
01:38:43,740 --> 01:38:45,560
But it would be a shame if the echo dies.

2477
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:46,220
I support it.

2478
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:47,160
Oh.

2479
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:47,980
You're a Mei player?

2480
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:49,640
It would be a shame.

2481
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,060
Am I a Tama player?

2482
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:51,720
Am I a Mei player?

2483
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:52,340
Make up your mind.

2484
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:54,660
People can play two teams.

2485
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:57,360
I did say it was a shame.

2486
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,540
Look, he get pock- I told you!

2487
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:01,180
You can't help him!

2488
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:03,480
You can't fucking help him!

2489
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:05,200
He dies with a pocket!

2490
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:08,580
He fucking dies with a pocket!

2491
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:09,760
You can't save him!

2492
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:11,380
Oh my god.

2493
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:12,740
Holy shit.

2494
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:19,340
You can't heal stupid if he dies with a pocket!

2495
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:20,620
You can't fucking save him!

2496
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,240
I knew it wasn't me.

2497
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:27,240
I fucking knew it wasn't me!

2498
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,620
I knew I was getting targeted!

2499
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I fucking knew it!

2500
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,420
I'm swapping.

2501
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:37,620
Fuck this bitch.

2502
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:38,660
Fuck this whore.

2503
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:43,960
I was justified!

2504
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:46,760
I will never save him.

2505
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:48,380
I hope he dies in game.

2506
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:51,720
We are gonna hear you.

2507
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,620
They are not in voice.

2508
01:39:58,800 --> 01:39:59,440
Alright.

2509
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:00,080
Bye.

2510
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:06,240
Sorry, Overwatch puts me through a really rough place.

2511
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:12,340
Welcome to the Overwatch experience.

2512
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:15,100
God, it would be a shame if you die.

2513
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:23,880
Yo, this guy put his window down and I- This guy put his fucking ammo down and I hooked the window.

2514
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:25,220
I'm so mad.

2515
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:25,980
He's so dead.

2516
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:27,460
He's so dead.

2517
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:28,800
Bro, back up!

2518
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:29,180
Bro!

2519
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:30,280
Bro!

2520
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:32,060
Why are you still- Why are you healing?!

2521
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:32,500
What?!

2522
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:35,320
Oh my god!

2523
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:36,160
Why?!

2524
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:37,060
Why?!

2525
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:37,460
Reset!

2526
01:40:37,940 --> 01:40:38,380
Reset!

2527
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:40,660
Okay.

2528
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:45,620
The more you were alive, the more- What do you mean more of us were alive?

2529
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:46,960
It was two supports and a Mei!

2530
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:49,420
What the fuck am I supposed to do?!

2531
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:52,440
You can do the fucking 2020 finals.

2532
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:55,580
The fucking- Whatever it's called.

2533
01:40:56,020 --> 01:40:56,460
Ow.

2534
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:00,160
Are you gonna drop him on top of your head?

2535
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:01,100
Alright, I have ult soon.

2536
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:04,200
Oh, he did get the Sigma.

2537
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:05,560
Good for him.

2538
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,020
Doing the bare fucking minimum.

2539
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:11,780
This is where I die.

2540
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:15,000
Big Flux!

2541
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:15,460
Big Flux!

2542
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:17,360
Holy shit!

2543
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:21,360
What a fucking- Okay, not gonna lie.

2544
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:25,240
That was- That was an insane combo.

2545
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:27,760
Bro, this kid is fucking five.

2546
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:31,460
Alright, we find the key.

2547
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:33,460
What?

2548
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:34,840
What?

2549
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:38,460
I fucking swapped him Ana.

2550
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:43,140
I don't think that was on her Ana and that was definitely not on me.

2551
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:45,360
What?!

2552
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:49,500
I literally swapped Ana on the last fucking thing.

2553
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:53,200
This kid is like twelve.

2554
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:55,100
This kid is twelve.

2555
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:56,480
There's no fucking way.

2556
01:41:56,660 --> 01:42:03,300
I'm gonna- This- Never peaked Masters on your level 321 account.

2557
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,140
Stop blaming everyone but yourself!

2558
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:06,800
Except for support.

2559
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:08,400
Except- Yes it is!

2560
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:08,840
Stop!

2561
01:42:09,380 --> 01:42:10,280
Right or wrong?

2562
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:12,860
Holy shit.

2563
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:14,880
You're fucking trash, kid.

2564
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,620
You're actually trash.

2565
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:19,960
You're the only one on this team without any healing.

2566
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:22,680
Do not leave a broken world behind.

2567
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:24,700
What are you doing?

2568
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,920
Inappropriate text chat, voice chat.

2569
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:29,220
That's what I thought.

2570
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:32,940
Underage- Okay, I should say underage.

2571
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:39,440
Blaming everyone but your- but yourself.

2572
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:42,300
I did not- I did not say all that.

2573
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:45,380
Thank you.

2574
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:46,560
Toxic as hell.

2575
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:48,440
Bro, go back to school.

2576
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:49,980
Just kidding.

2577
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:52,340
At your- at his age?

2578
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:54,600
I was fucking top 500.

2579
01:42:54,860 --> 01:42:56,120
What the fuck is this kid doing?

2580
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,740
He is like high school and still Diamond.

2581
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:03,700
Fucking learn the game.

2582
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:07,880
This game's been out for like seven plus years and you're still Diamond?

2583
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:09,860
Don't be a Diamond shitter.

2584
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:15,570
Oh my god.

2585
01:43:16,130 --> 01:43:20,230
Imagine fucking still being a Diamond shitter after like...

2586
01:43:20,890 --> 01:43:23,210
Okay, so...

2587
01:43:23,210 --> 01:43:25,510
And not peeking more in that.

2588
01:43:26,850 --> 01:43:28,930
Oh, it would be a shame if he dies.

2589
01:43:29,230 --> 01:43:30,570
Why is there a cast there?

2590
01:43:30,690 --> 01:43:30,810
What do you mean?

2591
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:33,570
Yeah, oh man.

2592
01:43:33,770 --> 01:43:35,470
Why is there a cast there?

2593
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:36,930
I will not let them rise.

2594
01:43:37,070 --> 01:43:38,350
I'm gonna stand here menacingly.

2595
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:39,010
Alright.

2596
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:39,790
Alright.

2597
01:43:39,790 --> 01:43:41,690
Oh man, sucks that fucking he's dead.

2598
01:43:43,830 --> 01:43:44,850
So sad.

2599
01:43:45,690 --> 01:43:46,850
Oh my god.

2600
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:48,230
Sucks that he's dead.

2601
01:43:49,930 --> 01:43:50,950
Alright, I'm heading over.

2602
01:43:55,610 --> 01:44:00,210
Everybody gets heals except for- except for the- except for that guy.

2603
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:03,110
You're fine.

2604
01:44:03,150 --> 01:44:03,530
You're fine.

2605
01:44:03,870 --> 01:44:05,850
Her mercy is just fucking pistoling them.

2606
01:44:07,590 --> 01:44:09,770
Honestly, you're just mad she's go bossing.

2607
01:44:16,490 --> 01:44:20,110
Look, if you're- you guys are still Diamond after seven years on the game, it's not you guys.

2608
01:44:20,230 --> 01:44:20,750
It's your team.

2609
01:44:21,030 --> 01:44:27,150
But this guy, this guy 100%, 100%, he's gonna be stuck in Diamond forever.

2610
01:44:27,550 --> 01:44:29,330
And it's because of him himself.

2611
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:31,070
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

2612
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:31,290
I'm fine.

2613
01:44:34,830 --> 01:44:37,330
It's because of- it's because of him.

2614
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:39,070
Individually as a player.

2615
01:44:39,070 --> 01:44:42,030
Not because- not because of you guys.

2616
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:43,970
Yeah, it's fine.

2617
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:45,190
He's jumping off the map.

2618
01:44:45,370 --> 01:44:45,790
It's fine.

2619
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:48,050
Thank you for this.

2620
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:49,430
He's hard stuck.

2621
01:44:49,850 --> 01:44:51,150
He's fucking hard stuck.

2622
01:44:51,250 --> 01:44:54,510
He's never gonna get past Master 5 in his fucking life.

2623
01:44:55,630 --> 01:44:58,390
This is- after Squall, this is his whole thing.

2624
01:44:58,470 --> 01:45:06,010
He gets- he gets like a shitty time at Squall that he goes and be toxic in Overwatch because it's the only time he feels powerful.

2625
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:09,050
But thing is, it will never fix how shitty of a player he is.

2626
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:09,910
He's not the person he really is.

2627
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:13,310
He'll be like, oh!

2628
01:45:16,030 --> 01:45:16,430
Oh!

2629
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:22,470
The reason why like, people are like, shitty towards me is because other people are shitty.

2630
01:45:22,670 --> 01:45:24,090
But no, he's just an asshole.

2631
01:45:25,410 --> 01:45:26,230
Yo, kill this guy.

2632
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:29,150
Oh, I...

2633
01:45:30,030 --> 01:45:31,010
Damn, dude.

2634
01:45:32,610 --> 01:45:33,830
Oh my god, did I sleep him?

2635
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:34,230
I did.

2636
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:35,630
I must have sleep him.

2637
01:45:35,770 --> 01:45:36,350
I was gonna say.

2638
01:45:37,070 --> 01:45:37,470
Nooooooo!

2639
01:45:39,050 --> 01:45:40,370
He might rez this though.

2640
01:45:45,190 --> 01:45:45,630
Oh.

2641
01:45:48,870 --> 01:45:49,590
It's fine.

2642
01:45:49,650 --> 01:45:50,750
He didn't get the rez off.

2643
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:51,510
That's fine.

2644
01:45:52,670 --> 01:45:54,570
Oh, we don't have a Kiriko.

2645
01:45:57,490 --> 01:45:57,970
It's okay.

2646
01:45:58,070 --> 01:45:58,990
I'm coming to save the day.

2647
01:45:59,430 --> 01:46:02,150
Our supports get out alive and I'm here to save everyone.

2648
01:46:04,050 --> 01:46:05,010
I'm so sad.

2649
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:06,790
Listen.

2650
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:10,310
You were asking for it.

2651
01:46:10,310 --> 01:46:10,630
I was good.

2652
01:46:11,970 --> 01:46:12,910
I don't know.

2653
01:46:12,910 --> 01:46:13,470
I was good.

2654
01:46:15,330 --> 01:46:16,230
There's a hog there.

2655
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:23,110
I was good.

2656
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:24,230
I don't know.

2657
01:46:24,450 --> 01:46:25,610
Our Cassidy!

2658
01:46:27,390 --> 01:46:27,870
Bro!

2659
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:31,190
Bro, Cassidy is like, I don't know about you.

2660
01:46:31,270 --> 01:46:32,050
I'm getting healed.

2661
01:46:33,990 --> 01:46:34,690
I'm fine.

2662
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:37,570
We will end this now.

2663
01:46:37,710 --> 01:46:38,450
Get in there.

2664
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:40,770
Get in there.

2665
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:41,390
Oh my god.

2666
01:46:41,390 --> 01:46:42,350
He's actually won.

2667
01:46:42,690 --> 01:46:44,050
He's actually won.

2668
01:46:44,170 --> 01:46:44,730
Please.

2669
01:46:49,130 --> 01:46:52,130
There you go.

2670
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:54,690
Oh look.

2671
01:46:54,790 --> 01:46:56,410
The one heal of the day on that guy.

2672
01:47:01,770 --> 01:47:02,330
Nice.

2673
01:47:02,650 --> 01:47:03,090
Wait.

2674
01:47:03,190 --> 01:47:03,550
Where's he?

2675
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:04,870
Yay!

2676
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:05,390
We did it!

2677
01:47:06,850 --> 01:47:07,410
Yay!

2678
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:10,130
He sounds like a little... He sounds like a fucking Chihuahua.

2679
01:47:13,130 --> 01:47:13,850
Uphill bat.

2680
01:47:13,930 --> 01:47:15,570
Yeah, that felt like an uphill bat.

2681
01:47:16,790 --> 01:47:19,490
That kid was the uphill bat.

2682
01:47:25,090 --> 01:47:31,990
That... Yeah, that child was definitely an uphill... Don't be mean to Chihuahuas.

2683
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:39,130
I'm fucking no bite, bro.

2684
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:44,210
Doki roasting him in chat.

2685
01:47:44,330 --> 01:47:46,350
Of fucking course I'm roasting him in chat.

2686
01:47:46,750 --> 01:47:49,530
You got his fucking 15 minute of fame.

2687
01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:51,750
The thing is, like, he knows Ruben.

2688
01:47:51,810 --> 01:47:53,330
I'm pretty sure he knows, like...

2689
01:47:53,330 --> 01:47:54,290
I avoided him.

2690
01:47:54,310 --> 01:47:56,110
I avoided him and reported him.

2691
01:47:56,190 --> 01:47:59,070
But like, the thing is, he knows Ruben was streaming.

2692
01:47:59,210 --> 01:48:01,630
So I'm pretty sure, like, he was like...

2693
01:48:01,630 --> 01:48:03,530
He was like, trying to do like...

2694
01:48:03,530 --> 01:48:04,190
Like...

2695
01:48:04,190 --> 01:48:09,470
I guess like, attention... attention whore to Ruben's stream.

2696
01:48:09,790 --> 01:48:13,450
But he doesn't realize I'm a bigger streamer.

2697
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:15,630
So that's his reputation now.

2698
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:25,760
He made himself look like a fucking fool.

2699
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:33,190
Alright.

2700
01:48:33,470 --> 01:48:34,470
Here we go.

2701
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:37,510
Damn, he played himself.

2702
01:48:38,130 --> 01:48:41,090
He's just a... bait streamer.

2703
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:41,390
How did he do that?

2704
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:43,570
I'm going to put it in my lab.

2705
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:44,770
We don't have that guy on our team.

2706
01:48:44,830 --> 01:48:45,110
Let's go.

2707
01:48:45,290 --> 01:48:46,330
I can hit child.

2708
01:48:46,490 --> 01:48:46,930
That was unfortunate.

2709
01:48:47,410 --> 01:48:48,330
He was pretty good.

2710
01:48:48,610 --> 01:48:49,890
He was pretty...

2711
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:51,770
That guy was yapping the left way too much.

2712
01:48:52,730 --> 01:48:55,030
I like... Okay, it was pretty funny.

2713
01:48:55,130 --> 01:48:55,930
Our Cassidy...

2714
01:48:55,930 --> 01:48:56,950
Seems like you guys were having a good conversation.

2715
01:48:57,170 --> 01:48:57,590
I don't know.

2716
01:48:57,590 --> 01:48:59,410
The Cassidy was like, I don't know.

2717
01:48:59,470 --> 01:49:00,390
I'm getting healed, bro.

2718
01:49:01,430 --> 01:49:01,790
Alright.

2719
01:49:01,930 --> 01:49:02,250
Yeah.

2720
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:02,870
That's what it seems like.

2721
01:49:02,910 --> 01:49:04,230
And he'll never know.

2722
01:49:05,650 --> 01:49:05,830
Stop.

2723
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:05,890
Stop.

2724
01:49:05,890 --> 01:49:06,190
Stop.

2725
01:49:07,170 --> 01:49:08,450
That was my favorite part.

2726
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:14,430
When Cassi was backing me up and was like, I'm getting healed bro, I don't know.

2727
01:49:21,170 --> 01:49:23,190
Oh no, I'm about to go Kiriko?

2728
01:49:23,530 --> 01:49:23,870
Yeah.

2729
01:49:27,390 --> 01:49:31,170
Oh my god, he got burned so fucking fast.

2730
01:49:31,530 --> 01:49:32,650
I'm scared of getting hooked.

2731
01:49:34,730 --> 01:49:35,830
I'm scared of getting hooked.

2732
01:49:37,770 --> 01:49:38,850
Oh okay, nice.

2733
01:49:43,810 --> 01:49:44,750
Nice, he got Genji.

2734
01:49:46,170 --> 01:49:47,670
Wait, they get to play Mercy?

2735
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:49,030
And like...

2736
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:50,830
Oh wait, we have a Mercy.

2737
01:49:51,730 --> 01:49:53,090
Whoa, where's our fucking Hog?

2738
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:53,910
Oh there he is.

2739
01:49:54,950 --> 01:49:55,690
There's our Hog.

2740
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:04,190
Okay, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

2741
01:50:04,210 --> 01:50:04,710
We're fine, we're fine.

2742
01:50:05,910 --> 01:50:06,850
That was me.

2743
01:50:06,930 --> 01:50:08,230
That Mercy was... How?

2744
01:50:09,030 --> 01:50:10,670
How the fuck does he have...

2745
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:12,590
Oh god.

2746
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:14,470
Oh my god, no!

2747
01:50:16,230 --> 01:50:17,450
I'm about to go Kiriko.

2748
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:20,210
Goodbye, Cassidy.

2749
01:50:20,330 --> 01:50:20,830
Goodbye.

2750
01:50:23,510 --> 01:50:24,710
Goodbye, Cassidy.

2751
01:50:28,230 --> 01:50:29,430
Oh no.

2752
01:50:30,590 --> 01:50:32,290
Hog just now got hooked.

2753
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:33,910
That's okay.

2754
01:50:33,950 --> 01:50:34,110
That's okay.

2755
01:50:34,110 --> 01:50:36,150
They're gonna have Hog ult, I'm pretty sure.

2756
01:50:36,610 --> 01:50:39,750
Genji maybe might get Blade in like one more fight.

2757
01:50:40,290 --> 01:50:43,830
Cause like, I swear I have not seen the fucking Genji anywhere.

2758
01:50:45,530 --> 01:50:46,230
Oh shit!

2759
01:50:46,430 --> 01:50:47,850
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

2760
01:50:48,390 --> 01:50:49,970
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

2761
01:50:50,210 --> 01:50:52,850
Oh, not go, go, go, go, go.

2762
01:50:53,050 --> 01:50:53,750
I go.

2763
01:50:54,370 --> 01:50:55,850
Why are we ignoring the Kree?

2764
01:50:56,090 --> 01:50:56,590
Come on.

2765
01:50:56,830 --> 01:50:58,050
I go now.

2766
01:50:58,330 --> 01:50:59,390
I got him, so thank you.

2767
01:50:59,850 --> 01:51:01,010
I'll work your way up here.

2768
01:51:01,010 --> 01:51:03,530
That's what I meant by go.

2769
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:04,950
I'm going Kiriko.

2770
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:08,830
I'm Kiriko time.

2771
01:51:09,410 --> 01:51:11,790
I'm giving up on Ana.

2772
01:51:12,110 --> 01:51:13,650
Cause we need cleanse.

2773
01:51:14,030 --> 01:51:15,690
We need the cleanse.

2774
01:51:18,530 --> 01:51:21,230
The other Hog is scared.

2775
01:51:22,190 --> 01:51:23,710
Cassidy, Cassidy, please.

2776
01:51:24,450 --> 01:51:25,810
Cassidy, no!

2777
01:51:27,630 --> 01:51:28,770
I'm trying!

2778
01:51:34,430 --> 01:51:35,210
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA surroundings.

2779
01:51:36,470 --> 01:51:38,730
I don't know, she was just barely getting out.

2780
01:51:39,150 --> 01:51:45,890
Dis frust chillsп It's always Kiriko time.

2781
01:51:46,110 --> 01:51:47,070
Since when?

2782
01:51:47,330 --> 01:51:48,030
Since you two want.....

2783
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:52,830
They really wanted me.

2784
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:54,770
I even climbed!

2785
01:51:55,530 --> 01:51:57,570
I even climbed the wall!

2786
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:00,260
No unnecessary rings!

2787
01:52:00,260 --> 01:52:01,140
I don't understand!

2788
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:05,360
Where is...

2789
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:08,860
There's like three different things I heard.

2790
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:11,400
Yeah, they popped so many ults.

2791
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:16,340
I climbed up to avoid the Cassio just to get slashed.

2792
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:21,480
Just get shanked by Genji.

2793
01:52:22,140 --> 01:52:24,000
I was on the wrong part of the neighborhood.

2794
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:28,740
Climbing away out of this.

2795
01:52:30,260 --> 01:52:32,160
I have to play Kiriko for the cleanse.

2796
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:33,060
This sucks.

2797
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:34,700
This sucks.

2798
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:35,900
This is what happens.

2799
01:52:36,780 --> 01:52:39,220
When they have an Ana and we don't.

2800
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:41,360
How do you do this?

2801
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:43,720
Alright, here we go.

2802
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:45,100
This is it.

2803
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:47,240
What?

2804
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:49,160
Oh my god!

2805
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:50,060
Oh thank god!

2806
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:51,080
She missed her anti!

2807
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:51,960
She's just like me!

2808
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:53,120
Oh god.

2809
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,880
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please!

2810
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:58,780
No she's not.

2811
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:02,060
Oh my god.

2812
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:03,100
Who's healing the Mercy?

2813
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:03,340
What?

2814
01:53:03,640 --> 01:53:05,660
Who's healing the Mercy?

2815
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:09,460
Good question.

2816
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:10,220
Honestly.

2817
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:12,400
Oh!

2818
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:13,080
Tog'lo!

2819
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:14,580
Yes!

2820
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:15,860
I contributed.

2821
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:18,820
I contributed to this.

2822
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:21,040
Wait.

2823
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:21,840
Oh no.

2824
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:22,980
Oh no.

2825
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:23,720
The Hog's back.

2826
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,160
You're by yourself over there.

2827
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:27,180
That's okay.

2828
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:29,280
Is it okay?

2829
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:31,900
Please, please heal.

2830
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:32,520
Please heal me.

2831
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:32,700
Please.

2832
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:35,480
I can't!

2833
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:36,920
I can't heal you!

2834
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,100
I'm fucking with our Hog!

2835
01:53:39,540 --> 01:53:40,500
No, we cannot.

2836
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:41,240
We cannot.

2837
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:43,140
We cannot.

2838
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:47,140
Our poor Cassidy.

2839
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:48,820
Begging for the heals.

2840
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:54,860
We were all... We were all tunnel version on the Hog.

2841
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,740
It was in fact not okay.

2842
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:01,720
All right.

2843
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:03,960
All right.

2844
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:05,200
It's fine.

2845
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:06,020
This is fine.

2846
01:54:06,100 --> 01:54:06,840
We're so healthy.

2847
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:08,720
We're so healthy.

2848
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:12,340
This is good.

2849
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:14,040
This is not good.

2850
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:16,560
This is not good.

2851
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:18,840
No!

2852
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:21,100
I'm okay.

2853
01:54:21,580 --> 01:54:22,100
Wait.

2854
01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:22,480
You!

2855
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:22,980
You just...

2856
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:23,540
I'm okay.

2857
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:24,900
I heard your sound.

2858
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,440
They're gonna rez, aren't they?

2859
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:28,680
They're gonna rez, aren't they?

2860
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:30,380
They're gonna rez.

2861
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:31,440
I fucking knew it.

2862
01:54:31,540 --> 01:54:32,980
I fucking called it.

2863
01:54:36,180 --> 01:54:36,700
What?!

2864
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:38,560
We had 20 people!

2865
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,700
Nobody looked at the hog!

2866
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:58,180
All I'm saying is that we had 20 people and nobody looked at the hog.

2867
01:54:58,680 --> 01:54:58,940
Good job.

2868
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:03,180
I knew he got hooked by 20 people.

2869
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:05,920
Kill hog.

2870
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:06,640
No.

2871
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:07,560
I'm not there.

2872
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:08,560
I'm here now.

2873
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:11,260
I'm gonna save my cleanse for him.

2874
01:55:11,420 --> 01:55:12,000
Okay, I live these.

2875
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:12,920
You do.

2876
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:14,020
Did you load?

2877
01:55:14,020 --> 01:55:14,320
No!

2878
01:55:16,780 --> 01:55:17,640
Oh, thank god.

2879
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:18,280
Okay, thank god.

2880
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:19,020
Okay, it's fine.

2881
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:19,440
It's fine.

2882
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:19,840
It's fine.

2883
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:21,100
Nothing to worry about.

2884
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:22,780
Nothing to worry about.

2885
01:55:22,900 --> 01:55:23,780
He missed his hook.

2886
01:55:24,160 --> 01:55:24,600
See?

2887
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:28,220
He doesn't have hook.

2888
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:31,260
As long as I don't look at him, we'll be fine.

2889
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:33,200
He doesn't have hook again.

2890
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:33,520
Let's leave.

2891
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:35,420
Oh god.

2892
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:36,560
Oh god.

2893
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:37,880
There you go.

2894
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:40,300
There you go!

2895
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:40,680
We're fine!

2896
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:42,080
Okay.

2897
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:47,980
Nice.

2898
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:48,400
See?

2899
01:55:48,580 --> 01:55:49,180
Everything's fine.

2900
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:52,560
He's so low!

2901
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:54,500
Cassidy's right here.

2902
01:55:54,620 --> 01:55:55,280
We gotta kill Ana too.

2903
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:57,280
Where the fuck is the Cassidy?

2904
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:58,020
I pushed it, Zamp.

2905
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:00,420
Oh, there's the Cassidy.

2906
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:01,860
You take a lot of damage, huh?

2907
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:03,280
Heroes never die.

2908
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:04,160
What the fuck?

2909
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:04,640
I'm on fire!

2910
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:05,760
What was he doing in that corner?

2911
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:07,320
It's go time!

2912
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:08,760
They're on his one on me.

2913
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:09,360
Oh god.

2914
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,080
Oh, they didn't touch!

2915
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:11,600
I should have...

2916
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:12,360
They didn't touch!

2917
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:14,080
We're okay.

2918
01:56:15,580 --> 01:56:16,580
Enemy in sight!

2919
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:19,180
You can't hook if you don't look.

2920
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:19,600
Exactly!

2921
01:56:20,020 --> 01:56:23,680
If you don't look at the hog, you never get hooked.

2922
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:25,320
That's the game plan.

2923
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:27,260
I told you my Kiriko's not that good.

2924
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:28,560
Don't look at the accuracy.

2925
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:31,600
I like your mask.

2926
01:56:32,900 --> 01:56:34,900
I said I like your mask, dude.

2927
01:56:35,980 --> 01:56:37,220
See, it's not that bad.

2928
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:41,060
It's all right.

2929
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:43,080
I have to play Kiriko for cleanse.

2930
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:45,580
Let's Kiriko go.

2931
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:46,200
Exactly.

2932
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:48,000
No, no, no.

2933
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:48,660
Don't look at...

2934
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:49,040
Look at...

2935
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:49,580
Oh my god.

2936
01:56:49,620 --> 01:56:50,520
Don't look at the heals though.

2937
01:56:50,660 --> 01:56:51,120
Oh my god.

2938
01:56:51,140 --> 01:56:51,960
Don't look at the heals.

2939
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:52,940
Oh, it's just...

2940
01:56:52,940 --> 01:56:53,540
Whoa!

2941
01:56:55,220 --> 01:56:56,020
Round three.

2942
01:56:56,700 --> 01:56:57,100
Capture.

2943
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:57,240
No, no, no.

2944
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:02,320
If you don't look, they don't see.

2945
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:05,540
All right.

2946
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:07,160
Let's see.

2947
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:09,160
Where are they at?

2948
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:12,960
We'll be fine.

2949
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:14,220
You know, I have a plan.

2950
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:15,760
I don't like this plan already.

2951
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:17,380
Let's just do it.

2952
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:18,320
Ow.

2953
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:18,860
Yo.

2954
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:19,860
Oh!

2955
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:21,800
Here's a look.

2956
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:23,200
Yes!

2957
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:24,720
Oh, keep him up!

2958
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:25,380
Keep him up!

2959
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:26,540
Oh, they got the rez.

2960
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:27,240
They got the rez.

2961
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:29,100
And then he got the hook!

2962
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:31,440
Where's this bullshit?

2963
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:36,680
Oh no.

2964
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:37,780
I'm fucking dead.

2965
01:57:38,700 --> 01:57:39,200
What?

2966
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:42,680
I'm fucking...

2967
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:44,720
Yeah, I'm dead.

2968
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:46,300
I'm dead.

2969
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:56,820
Guys, every time I hear, let's hear a plan, I knew it was not going to be good.

2970
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:02,280
It's never good when you hear, let's hear a plan.

2971
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:04,360
I had a feeling.

2972
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:06,920
Guys, I had a feeling.

2973
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:07,600
Hog's left side.

2974
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:11,520
All right.

2975
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:14,440
I am heading to our hog.

2976
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:17,520
I am heading to our hog.

2977
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:20,220
Oh my god!

2978
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:22,140
Cleanse!

2979
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:24,600
Cleanse!

2980
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,180
This is it!

2981
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:27,220
I saved my cleanse!

2982
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:28,260
Cleanse for that one moment!

2983
01:58:28,540 --> 01:58:30,120
The one streamer moment!

2984
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:31,480
I did it.

2985
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:34,600
I did it.

2986
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:35,680
What?

2987
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:37,180
All right.

2988
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:37,860
I'm rezzing.

2989
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:38,460
I'm rezzing.

2990
01:58:40,900 --> 01:58:42,500
I should not do that.

2991
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:43,520
I could have got hooked.

2992
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:47,440
I almost got hooked there.

2993
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:49,780
Bad rush.

2994
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:52,260
Oh god.

2995
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:53,160
Oh god.

2996
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:54,160
Oh god.

2997
01:58:54,700 --> 01:58:55,220
Oh god.

2998
01:58:56,140 --> 01:58:57,180
Oh god.

2999
01:58:57,180 --> 01:58:57,200
Oh god.

3000
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:57,540
No!

3001
01:59:00,060 --> 01:59:00,580
Please.

3002
01:59:00,860 --> 01:59:02,200
Don't let them flip it.

3003
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:04,340
Do not let them flip it!

3004
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:05,300
Hit your shots!

3005
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:05,500
Go!

3006
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:08,100
The soldier didn't hit the shot.

3007
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:10,500
The soldier didn't hit the shots.

3008
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:10,740
Oh my god.

3009
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:11,520
I'm anti-knife.

3010
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:12,100
I can't do that.

3011
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:14,280
Not like this.

3012
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:14,660
Get up.

3013
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:14,820
Get up.

3014
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:15,020
Get up.

3015
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:16,520
Not like this.

3016
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:19,460
Don't get hooked!

3017
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:21,480
No.

3018
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:22,580
He doesn't hook.

3019
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:23,300
Yes.

3020
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:23,720
No hook.

3021
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:26,820
And I succeeded.

3022
01:59:26,820 --> 01:59:27,180
And today is the day.

3023
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:29,840
Ana, please.

3024
01:59:30,340 --> 01:59:32,580
Ana, he can jump back up.

3025
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:34,340
They can jump back up.

3026
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:34,980
Ana, please.

3027
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:37,420
Please.

3028
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:40,580
He knows how to jump.

3029
01:59:40,700 --> 01:59:41,500
Ana, no!

3030
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:44,340
No!

3031
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:49,920
Ana, why would you be there?

3032
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:52,680
They know how to jump.

3033
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:59,100
There you go.

3034
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:04,740
Don't say it's over!

3035
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:07,440
Don't say it, guys!

3036
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:09,460
It can't be over yet!

3037
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,220
Maybe I'm just an Ana bot.

3038
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:14,520
Maybe I'm just an Ana one trick now.

3039
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:19,840
Because I could just be an Ana one trick at this point.

3040
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:26,360
I feel like I've had more success as Ana.

3041
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:28,200
I can't believe it.

3042
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:32,360
I do better when I'm on Ana than any other character.

3043
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:36,280
Alright, no more getting picked.

3044
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:37,920
Yeah.

3045
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,360
Whoever gets picked, be blamed for the entire game.

3046
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:41,640
Oh god, I'm gonna run away.

3047
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:43,060
I'm gonna be here.

3048
02:00:43,260 --> 02:00:45,140
I'm gonna position myself away from everybody.

3049
02:00:53,620 --> 02:00:55,740
Save my cleanse for our antis.

3050
02:00:57,180 --> 02:00:58,060
No hinders.

3051
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:04,420
Don't die, guys!

3052
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:09,200
You're doing that thing.

3053
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:10,620
No more.

3054
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:12,220
You're dropping?

3055
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:14,800
But our DPS needs help!

3056
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:17,300
I'm on point with Hog ult, by the way.

3057
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:18,640
Oh god.

3058
02:01:20,720 --> 02:01:21,420
Oh god.

3059
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:23,640
Wait, what the fuck?

3060
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:26,520
No way!

3061
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:29,740
I thought my Ana's got this!

3062
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:32,320
No, you actually should be winnable.

3063
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:32,880
I'll come back to him.

3064
02:01:33,820 --> 02:01:34,540
Oh god.

3065
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:36,320
Oh god.

3066
02:01:37,940 --> 02:01:38,920
Really good today.

3067
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:40,100
Nice.

3068
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:42,580
Oh my god!

3069
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:46,120
We still have one more fight though, guys!

3070
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:49,540
We still have one more fight and he's on Doomfist and he's not in Orb.

3071
02:01:49,660 --> 02:01:49,920
Okay.

3072
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:50,860
Okay.

3073
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:52,560
There's still one more fight.

3074
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:53,620
There's still one more fight.

3075
02:01:53,620 --> 02:01:54,420
We still have one more fight.

3076
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:55,340
Rook bottom right.

3077
02:01:56,620 --> 02:01:57,820
I gotta keep our...

3078
02:01:58,320 --> 02:01:59,940
I gotta keep our DPS alive.

3079
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:00,540
Panic fix.

3080
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:03,480
I'll Doomhap.

3081
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:05,500
Praise on me.

3082
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:10,320
This is fine.

3083
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:11,880
Cleanse!

3084
02:02:14,220 --> 02:02:14,660
Cleanse!

3085
02:02:15,380 --> 02:02:16,240
Alright, no throwing.

3086
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:16,840
Got you!

3087
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:17,440
I got you!

3088
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:17,980
I got you!

3089
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:19,340
I got you!

3090
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:22,480
It's so winnable!

3091
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:23,060
Nice!

3092
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:26,140
I'm just that good!

3093
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:31,460
We did it!

3094
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:33,500
I fucking knew it.

3095
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:34,080
It's not me.

3096
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:36,060
It was never me.

3097
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,040
The comeback.

3098
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:44,220
It was never my fault.

3099
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:46,780
Bro, fuck that kid.

3100
02:02:47,020 --> 02:02:47,740
That kid.

3101
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:49,620
He lives right free in my mind right now.

3102
02:02:49,740 --> 02:02:51,700
Bitch, I hope you keep losing SR.

3103
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:56,680
Fuck that child!

3104
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:03,260
That's right, I don't need you!

3105
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:05,960
Dude.

3106
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:08,420
It was the chihuahua...

3107
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:11,760
It was the fucking chihuahua.

3108
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:17,260
I think my favorite thing about your dick is how it's not in Orb.

3109
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:19,120
NS, thank you for the super chat.

3110
02:03:19,220 --> 02:03:19,500
Thank you.

3111
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:19,920
Thank you!

3112
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:20,280
You know what?

3113
02:03:20,340 --> 02:03:21,440
That's my favorite thing too.

3114
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:22,700
I think you're right.

3115
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:26,440
The fact that he's not an orb and I can actually see my tank...

3116
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:30,620
makes so much of a difference in video games.

3117
02:03:30,740 --> 02:03:31,460
It's actually crazy.

3118
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:33,940
Jem, thank you for the one gifted chip!

3119
02:03:34,060 --> 02:03:34,260
Thank you!

3120
02:03:36,120 --> 02:03:37,960
That damn fucking Chihuahua.

3121
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:41,160
Yay!

3122
02:03:42,340 --> 02:03:43,300
Here we go.

3123
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:47,540
Zen time!

3124
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:49,260
Zen time!

3125
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:55,740
Because I don't want to play Kiriko!

3126
02:03:58,020 --> 02:04:00,500
I don't want to play Kiriko!

3127
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:10,420
Let's make sure we kick all the fucking...

3128
02:04:10,420 --> 02:04:12,280
Band of the pillars.

3129
02:04:13,660 --> 02:04:17,660
I wish Blizzard World was real.

3130
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:20,480
Is anybody else here up with me?

3131
02:04:20,580 --> 02:04:20,840
No?

3132
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:22,340
Okay guys, I can...

3133
02:04:22,340 --> 02:04:23,360
Oh no, they have one.

3134
02:04:23,380 --> 02:04:24,020
They have a Wonton.

3135
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:25,840
I'm gonna leave.

3136
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:29,320
They have a Wonton.

3137
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:30,340
They have Moira?

3138
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:30,680
No way.

3139
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:31,120
And a Mora.

3140
02:04:31,420 --> 02:04:33,100
Ooh, that's scary actually.

3141
02:04:33,680 --> 02:04:34,940
Oh, and a Hanzo.

3142
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,320
Alright, I'm gonna back up a little bit.

3143
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:41,720
They have like a lot of characters that can actually like poke me and I'll die.

3144
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:44,220
Which I am not a huge fan of.

3145
02:04:47,120 --> 02:04:47,600
Why?!

3146
02:04:48,180 --> 02:04:48,840
Monkey's sleeping.

3147
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:49,420
Monkey's sleeping.

3148
02:04:49,540 --> 02:04:49,740
He's low.

3149
02:04:49,940 --> 02:04:50,920
Or high, high, high.

3150
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:51,480
Oh no!

3151
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:52,020
I'm gonna help with the...

3152
02:04:52,020 --> 02:04:52,880
Oh no!

3153
02:04:54,620 --> 02:04:57,000
Guys, I think I'm gonna...

3154
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,280
Hold up, nah I win these.

3155
02:04:58,360 --> 02:04:58,660
Leave.

3156
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:00,820
I'm gonna leave now.

3157
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:03,180
No, no, no, we actually win these.

3158
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:05,740
I'm gonna leave now.

3159
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:07,880
I am...

3160
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:09,380
Is he gonna touch?

3161
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:09,860
Okay.

3162
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:11,680
I couldn't touch.

3163
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:13,560
But I did my best.

3164
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:14,980
I answered him.

3165
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:17,880
I almost killed him.

3166
02:05:18,160 --> 02:05:18,840
I got you my nephew.

3167
02:05:19,140 --> 02:05:20,220
Thank you my hero.

3168
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:20,900
It's fine.

3169
02:05:21,020 --> 02:05:21,700
It's fine.

3170
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:22,580
Everything is fine.

3171
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:26,900
Guys, all I'm saying, when I die, I might pick a character...

3172
02:05:26,900 --> 02:05:28,040
Their monkey's real low.

3173
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:28,640
Yeah!

3174
02:05:30,860 --> 02:05:31,900
That's fucking right!

3175
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:32,740
Now if I...

3176
02:05:32,740 --> 02:05:33,500
Oh shit!

3177
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:34,640
Okay, I didn't get headshot.

3178
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:35,580
That's the... Thank God.

3179
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:36,960
I didn't get headshot guys.

3180
02:05:37,880 --> 02:05:38,360
Okay.

3181
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:41,660
They have to like go here, right?

3182
02:05:42,860 --> 02:05:43,780
Like I might...

3183
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:45,180
I'm fine.

3184
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:45,760
I'm okay.

3185
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:46,480
Oh he is not.

3186
02:05:46,520 --> 02:05:46,800
No!

3187
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:47,960
They went auto!

3188
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:51,600
They went auto and D.Va!

3189
02:05:53,730 --> 02:05:54,930
Wait, D.Va's sleeping?

3190
02:05:56,050 --> 02:05:56,790
It's fine.

3191
02:05:56,970 --> 02:05:57,950
I had to die.

3192
02:05:58,130 --> 02:05:59,430
It was just canon.

3193
02:06:03,190 --> 02:06:03,830
No!

3194
02:06:04,410 --> 02:06:05,870
They went auto!

3195
02:06:06,790 --> 02:06:09,230
They fucking cleansed this fat ass again!

3196
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:14,390
No!

3197
02:06:14,390 --> 02:06:15,530
Every time!

3198
02:06:16,870 --> 02:06:18,570
I got my one.

3199
02:06:18,570 --> 02:06:20,010
Every fucking time!

3200
02:06:21,170 --> 02:06:23,110
I have to fucking...

3201
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:24,650
I have to...

3202
02:06:24,650 --> 02:06:25,030
I killed D.Va.

3203
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:25,970
Oh my God, I know.

3204
02:06:26,550 --> 02:06:28,190
Okay, you won't be able to do anything with that?

3205
02:06:29,850 --> 02:06:30,810
Oh no.

3206
02:06:31,390 --> 02:06:32,390
Oh no.

3207
02:06:32,650 --> 02:06:32,930
Oh no.

3208
02:06:32,930 --> 02:06:33,170
D .Va?

3209
02:06:35,010 --> 02:06:35,750
Oh no.

3210
02:06:36,310 --> 02:06:37,290
Stop, stop, stop.

3211
02:06:37,450 --> 02:06:37,870
Stop.

3212
02:06:39,610 --> 02:06:40,650
There we go.

3213
02:06:40,710 --> 02:06:41,050
We're fine.

3214
02:06:42,950 --> 02:06:45,510
I'm gonna be fine though with this Genji on my ass.

3215
02:06:46,090 --> 02:06:46,770
It's okay.

3216
02:06:48,910 --> 02:06:49,510
It's okay.

3217
02:06:51,350 --> 02:06:53,310
Back to Kiri Jail I go.

3218
02:06:57,430 --> 02:07:00,190
You thought you could leave the Kiriko Jail?

3219
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:01,910
Look, I'm playing Kiriko.

3220
02:07:02,390 --> 02:07:05,630
Guys, it's because I need to up my win rate on Kiriko, okay guys?

3221
02:07:05,870 --> 02:07:07,210
This is the only reason.

3222
02:07:07,710 --> 02:07:08,150
No.

3223
02:07:08,190 --> 02:07:08,850
Oh no.

3224
02:07:08,950 --> 02:07:09,230
Please.

3225
02:07:11,030 --> 02:07:12,050
Please don't log me.

3226
02:07:12,130 --> 02:07:13,010
Please don't log me.

3227
02:07:13,370 --> 02:07:14,530
Please don't log me.

3228
02:07:15,490 --> 02:07:16,190
Just play.

3229
02:07:16,690 --> 02:07:17,330
Just play.

3230
02:07:17,910 --> 02:07:18,710
Just play.

3231
02:07:18,910 --> 02:07:19,730
Just play.

3232
02:07:19,930 --> 02:07:20,810
Please, I don't wanna...

3233
02:07:20,810 --> 02:07:21,430
Just play.

3234
02:07:21,850 --> 02:07:22,530
Just play.

3235
02:07:22,970 --> 02:07:23,750
Just play.

3236
02:07:24,150 --> 02:07:25,510
Don't force this off of me.

3237
02:07:25,730 --> 02:07:26,450
Just play.

3238
02:07:28,910 --> 02:07:29,430
Play.

3239
02:07:29,990 --> 02:07:30,510
Play.

3240
02:07:30,550 --> 02:07:31,350
Do the play.

3241
02:07:34,570 --> 02:07:35,330
There you go.

3242
02:07:35,510 --> 02:07:36,450
I got you!

3243
02:07:36,930 --> 02:07:38,790
Oh, I don't got you anymore!

3244
02:07:44,910 --> 02:07:47,570
Guys, I don't got you.

3245
02:07:49,890 --> 02:07:51,790
It's Kiriko time.

3246
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:55,450
Back to Kiriko Jail I go.

3247
02:07:56,150 --> 02:07:58,970
Back to Kiriko Jail I go.

3248
02:08:03,170 --> 02:08:04,650
I love Kiriko.

3249
02:08:05,190 --> 02:08:05,330
Woo!

3250
02:08:06,230 --> 02:08:06,890
Woo!

3251
02:08:06,890 --> 02:08:12,490
I love being Kiriko.

3252
02:08:13,150 --> 02:08:13,910
Yeah!

3253
02:08:16,050 --> 02:08:16,810
Yeah!

3254
02:08:16,990 --> 02:08:17,750
Cleanse time!

3255
02:08:18,270 --> 02:08:19,290
It's time to cleanse!

3256
02:08:20,990 --> 02:08:23,570
Time to cleanse all those aunties!

3257
02:08:24,050 --> 02:08:24,910
Let's go!

3258
02:08:26,930 --> 02:08:27,690
Woo!

3259
02:08:30,150 --> 02:08:31,710
Okay, I need to save my...

3260
02:08:31,710 --> 02:08:33,810
I need to save my cleanse for it.

3261
02:08:34,730 --> 02:08:35,490
Oh!

3262
02:08:37,850 --> 02:08:39,090
He ate him!

3263
02:08:40,590 --> 02:08:42,490
What's the point of cleansing?

3264
02:08:45,090 --> 02:08:46,410
Oh my God!

3265
02:08:47,150 --> 02:08:50,670
What's the point of cleansing if he just eats it?

3266
02:08:55,910 --> 02:08:58,850
Oh my God, I hope it was at least delicious.

3267
02:09:00,890 --> 02:09:02,070
Oh my God.

3268
02:09:05,030 --> 02:09:05,750
Guys...

3269
02:09:06,890 --> 02:09:07,610
Please.

3270
02:09:07,610 --> 02:09:07,910
Please.

3271
02:09:08,530 --> 02:09:09,170
Okay.

3272
02:09:09,450 --> 02:09:10,410
Thank god.

3273
02:09:14,590 --> 02:09:15,990
It's okay, they couldn't eat that.

3274
02:09:17,190 --> 02:09:17,830
What?!

3275
02:09:17,830 --> 02:09:18,470
Okay.

3276
02:09:18,770 --> 02:09:19,730
Here I go.

3277
02:09:20,570 --> 02:09:21,470
Here I go!

3278
02:09:22,610 --> 02:09:23,250
Wooo!

3279
02:09:24,750 --> 02:09:29,590
Okay, we needed maybe a Zarya there.

3280
02:09:29,910 --> 02:09:31,890
We need maybe...

3281
02:09:31,890 --> 02:09:33,470
We need Zarya Symmetra.

3282
02:09:37,610 --> 02:09:38,310
We just do better on offense.

3283
02:09:38,950 --> 02:09:40,990
We'll do better on offense, right?

3284
02:09:41,410 --> 02:09:42,590
Jesse, thank you for the super chat!

3285
02:09:42,710 --> 02:09:44,730
Thanks for reading my super chat earlier.

3286
02:09:44,830 --> 02:09:45,250
I'm back now.

3287
02:09:45,330 --> 02:09:46,170
Good luck on Masters.

3288
02:09:46,810 --> 02:09:47,470
It's okay.

3289
02:09:47,610 --> 02:09:51,290
As long as I'm throwing other people's top 500 games, I'm fine with that.

3290
02:09:52,790 --> 02:09:58,370
As long as I'm giving and taking top 500s from people, I'll be fine.

3291
02:09:59,490 --> 02:10:00,850
We're an offense team.

3292
02:10:01,890 --> 02:10:03,310
We're an offense team, guys.

3293
02:10:03,850 --> 02:10:04,630
This is it.

3294
02:10:07,090 --> 02:10:07,530
Really?

3295
02:10:07,610 --> 02:10:08,990
We're just an offense team.

3296
02:10:09,170 --> 02:10:10,330
This was our legacy.

3297
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:14,290
This was what we're meant to play as.

3298
02:10:15,950 --> 02:10:17,870
We were just meant to be...

3299
02:10:18,390 --> 02:10:20,210
We were just meant to be Kiriko.

3300
02:10:27,770 --> 02:10:28,670
Here we go.

3301
02:10:31,050 --> 02:10:31,870
It's fine.

3302
02:10:32,030 --> 02:10:34,530
Don't meet that guy, dude.

3303
02:10:38,170 --> 02:10:39,650
I was born for this.

3304
02:10:40,270 --> 02:10:41,810
I was born for this.

3305
02:10:43,990 --> 02:10:47,630
I hope somebody loses their top 500 in this game.

3306
02:10:51,830 --> 02:10:54,930
Here we go.

3307
02:10:57,890 --> 02:10:58,730
This is it.

3308
02:10:58,950 --> 02:10:59,830
I believe.

3309
02:11:01,150 --> 02:11:02,050
I believe.

3310
02:11:03,350 --> 02:11:03,650
Yay!

3311
02:11:07,610 --> 02:11:07,890
Yay!

3312
02:11:11,090 --> 02:11:11,570
Alright.

3313
02:11:12,790 --> 02:11:13,930
I caught the anti.

3314
02:11:14,390 --> 02:11:15,090
Oh, wait!

3315
02:11:15,350 --> 02:11:15,830
Wait!

3316
02:11:16,750 --> 02:11:17,930
If he plays...

3317
02:11:18,430 --> 02:11:20,290
If he plays fucking Zarya...

3318
02:11:20,290 --> 02:11:22,810
I wouldn't have to...

3319
02:11:22,810 --> 02:11:24,170
We should just win this for free.

3320
02:11:24,610 --> 02:11:25,490
Yeah, we should.

3321
02:11:25,550 --> 02:11:26,030
Technically.

3322
02:11:27,950 --> 02:11:29,410
That's how it should go, yes.

3323
02:11:30,070 --> 02:11:31,410
We got the best player.

3324
02:11:32,630 --> 02:11:33,550
Our Ana is okay.

3325
02:11:33,670 --> 02:11:34,250
Our Ana is okay.

3326
02:11:35,410 --> 02:11:36,910
Our Ana is so healthy.

3327
02:11:37,910 --> 02:11:38,490
But...

3328
02:11:39,690 --> 02:11:40,270
See?

3329
02:11:40,510 --> 02:11:41,650
I knew we were in...

3330
02:11:41,650 --> 02:11:44,350
I knew we were in the offense team.

3331
02:11:46,990 --> 02:11:48,550
Okay, I'm gonna fucking cap.

3332
02:11:49,490 --> 02:11:50,610
We don't need heals.

3333
02:11:52,430 --> 02:11:53,830
We don't need heals, guys.

3334
02:11:53,950 --> 02:11:54,430
We're fine.

3335
02:11:56,630 --> 02:11:58,030
All I'm saying...

3336
02:11:58,030 --> 02:12:00,120
Is that now that we have Zarya...

3337
02:12:00,610 --> 02:12:01,650
I don't...

3338
02:12:01,650 --> 02:12:03,410
I don't need to play...

3339
02:12:03,410 --> 02:12:05,430
I don't need to play Kiriko anymore.

3340
02:12:05,710 --> 02:12:06,890
Because the Zarya was...

3341
02:12:06,890 --> 02:12:08,370
Zarya bubbling is our cleansed.

3342
02:12:09,490 --> 02:12:10,870
We have tank cleanse.

3343
02:12:13,050 --> 02:12:15,010
So I can play whatever I want.

3344
02:12:15,230 --> 02:12:17,230
Oh my God!Counter -Picking!

3345
02:12:17,490 --> 02:12:20,930
How dare you Counter-Pick in my Overwatch games?

3346
02:12:21,310 --> 02:12:23,530
You're all supposed to one-trick a hero.

3347
02:12:25,610 --> 02:12:28,530
This fucking sucks.

3348
02:12:28,930 --> 02:12:29,650
.

3349
02:12:29,650 --> 02:12:31,130
.

3350
02:12:31,130 --> 02:12:32,090
Okay, guys, I changed my mind.

3351
02:12:32,130 --> 02:12:32,630
I need help.

3352
02:12:36,570 --> 02:12:36,970
Okay.

3353
02:12:40,430 --> 02:12:41,230
Okay, I...

3354
02:12:44,250 --> 02:12:44,770
Here we go.

3355
02:12:45,370 --> 02:12:45,990
I'm dead.

3356
02:12:48,450 --> 02:12:48,850
No!

3357
02:12:53,750 --> 02:12:54,550
Team wipe!

3358
02:12:54,750 --> 02:12:55,310
It's okay, I have rush.

3359
02:12:55,490 --> 02:12:57,910
Now I can go D.Va and counterswap their tank again.

3360
02:12:58,170 --> 02:12:59,130
Oh my god.

3361
02:12:59,130 --> 02:13:02,350
I can't believe people are countering each other.

3362
02:13:02,770 --> 02:13:04,770
This is not the Overwatch I remember.

3363
02:13:07,610 --> 02:13:09,230
Where are my one tricks?

3364
02:13:09,530 --> 02:13:11,710
On the enemy team, but not on my team though.

3365
02:13:11,770 --> 02:13:12,470
Not on my team.

3366
02:13:12,530 --> 02:13:12,970
No, no, no.

3367
02:13:13,910 --> 02:13:14,730
No, no, no.

3368
02:13:19,310 --> 02:13:22,270
Can't even use my fucking rush because like...

3369
02:13:22,870 --> 02:13:23,990
Where are we rushing?

3370
02:13:29,130 --> 02:13:29,870
I'm just...

3371
02:13:29,870 --> 02:13:30,850
Enemy fight!

3372
02:13:31,030 --> 02:13:32,210
Woo, please.

3373
02:13:34,030 --> 02:13:34,730
That's fine.

3374
02:13:35,090 --> 02:13:35,730
We're fine.

3375
02:13:35,890 --> 02:13:36,770
Oh, we're not fine.

3376
02:13:38,310 --> 02:13:41,830
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3377
02:13:41,950 --> 02:13:44,350
They fucking Sombra took the cleanse.

3378
02:13:44,430 --> 02:13:45,690
That's actually pretty awkward.

3379
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:48,330
That's pretty awkward.

3380
02:13:48,830 --> 02:13:50,590
All right, we are...

3381
02:13:50,590 --> 02:13:53,010
You can nano me this fight and I can just like dive somebody.

3382
02:13:53,190 --> 02:13:54,550
All right, we're gonna...

3383
02:13:55,690 --> 02:13:56,990
We're gonna play.

3384
02:13:56,990 --> 02:14:00,210
Okay, but like hear me out.

3385
02:14:00,670 --> 02:14:01,550
Hear me out.

3386
02:14:01,770 --> 02:14:03,170
What if we play...

3387
02:14:03,170 --> 02:14:04,850
What if we play Brig?

3388
02:14:05,090 --> 02:14:05,930
Hear me out.

3389
02:14:06,630 --> 02:14:09,730
I barely played Brig, but like I think I can take him on.

3390
02:14:12,790 --> 02:14:14,630
Oh my God, we almost see nine.

3391
02:14:15,110 --> 02:14:16,510
They almost see nine.

3392
02:14:17,910 --> 02:14:19,050
They have Primal.

3393
02:14:20,050 --> 02:14:20,530
Nope.

3394
02:14:22,190 --> 02:14:22,670
Okay.

3395
02:14:25,250 --> 02:14:25,730
Oh!

3396
02:14:26,150 --> 02:14:26,670
Oh, my God.

3397
02:14:26,670 --> 02:14:26,970
Oh, my God.

3398
02:14:27,870 --> 02:14:28,970
Okay, I hit those.

3399
02:14:29,290 --> 02:14:30,730
I hit Zuzu's.

3400
02:14:34,010 --> 02:14:35,530
Oh, this is where we died.

3401
02:14:35,710 --> 02:14:36,470
This is where we die.

3402
02:14:36,590 --> 02:14:37,330
This is where we die.

3403
02:14:40,830 --> 02:14:42,210
All right, I'm going Brig.

3404
02:14:42,330 --> 02:14:42,830
Fuck this.

3405
02:14:44,250 --> 02:14:45,050
Hear me out.

3406
02:14:45,110 --> 02:14:45,710
This will work.

3407
02:14:45,830 --> 02:14:47,130
Guys, hear me out.

3408
02:14:48,150 --> 02:14:49,990
This will 100% work.

3409
02:14:50,530 --> 02:14:51,290
Hear me out.

3410
02:14:52,490 --> 02:14:55,750
I'm gonna fucking counter them so fucking hard.

3411
02:14:55,750 --> 02:14:55,950
Alright.

3412
02:14:56,070 --> 02:14:57,150
Watch this.

3413
02:14:58,430 --> 02:14:59,130
I did it.

3414
02:15:01,730 --> 02:15:03,710
I told you.

3415
02:15:03,910 --> 02:15:06,890
I swapped Brig and then I did it.

3416
02:15:06,950 --> 02:15:07,930
I countered the Winton.

3417
02:15:08,690 --> 02:15:10,190
It was that easy.

3418
02:15:10,670 --> 02:15:12,550
Oh my god.

3419
02:15:12,630 --> 02:15:14,450
It was actually that easy.

3420
02:15:17,350 --> 02:15:20,090
Are we... are none of us on the cart?

3421
02:15:20,490 --> 02:15:23,150
None of us went on the...

3422
02:15:24,630 --> 02:15:27,010
None of us actually went on the cart.

3423
02:15:27,130 --> 02:15:28,210
That's actually crazy.

3424
02:15:33,670 --> 02:15:34,270
Alright.

3425
02:15:35,030 --> 02:15:36,490
Remember when I said I'm gonna counter the Winton?

3426
02:15:36,790 --> 02:15:39,170
I did not predict a ult.

3427
02:15:42,350 --> 02:15:42,950
Okay.

3428
02:15:44,030 --> 02:15:47,630
I can't... I can't stop a fucking monkey ult.

3429
02:15:47,750 --> 02:15:48,830
That's all I'm saying.

3430
02:15:49,390 --> 02:15:53,990
I'm all... I can't stop a monkey ult.

3431
02:15:56,090 --> 02:15:56,590
Alright.

3432
02:15:56,790 --> 02:15:57,110
Okay.

3433
02:15:57,190 --> 02:15:57,830
Hear me out.

3434
02:15:58,310 --> 02:15:59,910
What if I swapped this... Okay.

3435
02:15:59,950 --> 02:16:00,310
I can't swap.

3436
02:16:00,410 --> 02:16:01,090
I should build an ult first.

3437
02:16:01,350 --> 02:16:03,650
I'm gonna build this ult first and then we'll swap.

3438
02:16:05,210 --> 02:16:06,510
Monkey too strong.

3439
02:16:08,470 --> 02:16:09,770
It was just unlucky.

3440
02:16:11,490 --> 02:16:12,950
I'm gonna protect this Ana though.

3441
02:16:15,870 --> 02:16:16,930
I'll protect people.

3442
02:16:17,070 --> 02:16:17,550
Don't worry.

3443
02:16:18,830 --> 02:16:19,910
I'll protect my team.

3444
02:16:21,050 --> 02:16:22,150
I'm gonna force guard.

3445
02:16:22,850 --> 02:16:24,490
I'll be here with you on cart.

3446
02:16:26,750 --> 02:16:27,530
Oh shit.

3447
02:16:28,670 --> 02:16:29,190
Please.

3448
02:16:29,490 --> 02:16:30,010
Oh!

3449
02:16:31,150 --> 02:16:32,190
Oh no!

3450
02:16:33,690 --> 02:16:34,210
Please!

3451
02:16:34,210 --> 02:16:36,550
I thought the Ana would look at me!

3452
02:16:37,390 --> 02:16:38,050
It's okay.

3453
02:16:38,170 --> 02:16:38,550
Guys.

3454
02:16:38,810 --> 02:16:39,670
It's okay guys.

3455
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:40,290
It's okay.

3456
02:16:40,630 --> 02:16:41,970
It was just... Okay.

3457
02:16:42,030 --> 02:16:43,050
Maybe it's not okay.

3458
02:16:43,190 --> 02:16:44,070
Maybe it's...

3459
02:16:44,070 --> 02:16:44,170
Thank you though.

3460
02:16:46,290 --> 02:16:46,810
Maybe...

3461
02:16:46,810 --> 02:16:48,690
Maybe it's not okay.

3462
02:16:49,550 --> 02:16:50,870
Maybe it's not okay.

3463
02:16:50,970 --> 02:16:51,950
I shouldn't be swapping.

3464
02:16:52,130 --> 02:16:52,570
Look.

3465
02:16:52,750 --> 02:16:53,410
This is it.

3466
02:16:53,430 --> 02:16:54,150
More is to pick.

3467
02:16:54,850 --> 02:16:56,130
The plan isn't working.

3468
02:16:56,930 --> 02:16:58,570
I realized that like...

3469
02:16:58,570 --> 02:17:01,230
Maybe I need to know how to play Brig.

3470
02:17:01,330 --> 02:17:01,990
To play Brig.

3471
02:17:02,610 --> 02:17:04,510
It's definitely not okay.

3472
02:17:07,990 --> 02:17:11,410
I feel like I need to know how to play Brig.

3473
02:17:11,450 --> 02:17:12,030
To play Brig.

3474
02:17:12,170 --> 02:17:13,330
I don't play Brig.

3475
02:17:13,510 --> 02:17:14,370
Is that obvious?

3476
02:17:15,590 --> 02:17:17,190
Is it obvious that I don't play Brig?

3477
02:17:17,250 --> 02:17:17,850
I can't tell.

3478
02:17:18,990 --> 02:17:19,790
Oh...

3479
02:17:19,790 --> 02:17:21,810
Oh my god...

3480
02:17:21,810 --> 02:17:22,790
Bro, this fucking...

3481
02:17:22,790 --> 02:17:24,630
This monkey has been...

3482
02:17:24,630 --> 02:17:27,050
Bro, please, please, please.

3483
02:17:32,270 --> 02:17:33,870
All right.

3484
02:17:34,230 --> 02:17:35,930
Oh my god!

3485
02:17:37,410 --> 02:17:39,430
This fucking monkey...

3486
02:17:39,430 --> 02:17:42,670
It has been chasing me this entire time!

3487
02:17:44,430 --> 02:17:44,830
Really?

3488
02:17:44,970 --> 02:17:46,190
It's not obvious.

3489
02:17:48,990 --> 02:17:50,370
Oh my god.

3490
02:17:51,030 --> 02:17:52,910
Yeah, the monkey was so good.

3491
02:17:53,150 --> 02:17:54,310
I can't believe it.

3492
02:17:54,330 --> 02:17:54,730
You know what?

3493
02:17:54,830 --> 02:17:56,790
It was an equal fair match.

3494
02:17:57,210 --> 02:18:00,330
The monkey absolutely fucking hated me.

3495
02:18:00,610 --> 02:18:03,110
I swear I was getting targeted.

3496
02:18:03,350 --> 02:18:04,250
I swear.

3497
02:18:04,590 --> 02:18:06,410
This was targeted harassment.

3498
02:18:11,690 --> 02:18:13,690
I can't believe it.

3499
02:18:15,150 --> 02:18:16,370
It was targeted.

3500
02:18:17,270 --> 02:18:19,510
I refuse to believe it wasn't.

3501
02:18:19,970 --> 02:18:21,630
It was not me.

3502
02:18:23,910 --> 02:18:25,050
Ban him!

3503
02:18:25,550 --> 02:18:27,590
Ban him for targeted harassment!

3504
02:18:31,090 --> 02:18:34,810
That went through the strongest dokey hater.

3505
02:18:34,970 --> 02:18:36,050
He's an anti.

3506
02:18:36,190 --> 02:18:37,090
I can feel it.

3507
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:44,060
I can feel the anti in him.

3508
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:46,980
Alright.

3509
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:48,120
I'm on it now.

3510
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:49,680
I'll be on it one trick.

3511
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:50,520
I'm on it one trick.

3512
02:18:51,340 --> 02:18:52,920
I'll be an Ana one trick.

3513
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:53,760
I'll be an Ana one trick.

3514
02:18:53,800 --> 02:18:54,320
Yay!

3515
02:18:58,060 --> 02:18:58,580
Alright.

3516
02:18:58,820 --> 02:19:00,560
A voice as teammate.

3517
02:19:01,080 --> 02:19:04,140
I can't even get him as my teammate because I'm duo'd with a team.

3518
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:04,780
Yo, yo, yo.

3519
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:06,100
How you guys doing?

3520
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:08,200
This is gonna hit something.

3521
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:08,760
Yo.

3522
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:12,640
So, was this wide-cued for you?

3523
02:19:13,460 --> 02:19:13,980
No.

3524
02:19:13,980 --> 02:19:14,800
This is Diamond 2.

3525
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:15,820
Oh, okay.

3526
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:19,240
Oh, just asking.

3527
02:19:20,540 --> 02:19:20,840
A little birdie told me.

3528
02:19:22,620 --> 02:19:24,960
A little birdie told you what?

3529
02:19:25,280 --> 02:19:28,120
That your tank might be wide-cued.

3530
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:30,920
What the fuck?

3531
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:31,760
What does it mean?

3532
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:33,060
Yeah, you know.

3533
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:34,440
Okay, it's waiting.

3534
02:19:35,420 --> 02:19:36,260
Oh, anti!

3535
02:19:36,520 --> 02:19:36,920
Huge!

3536
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:38,200
Oh, they have a widow!

3537
02:19:39,820 --> 02:19:41,220
They have a widow!

3538
02:19:41,560 --> 02:19:42,600
Oh my god!

3539
02:19:43,180 --> 02:19:43,780
Oh my god!

3540
02:19:44,340 --> 02:19:46,300
Oh my god, she's so loud though.

3541
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:47,060
Holy shit.

3542
02:19:47,300 --> 02:19:49,220
Her mic is like, peaky.

3543
02:19:51,480 --> 02:19:52,440
I'm leaving.

3544
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:53,800
I'm leaving.

3545
02:19:56,080 --> 02:19:56,720
Goodbye.

3546
02:19:57,900 --> 02:19:58,920
Not goodbye?

3547
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:00,240
Not goodbye.

3548
02:20:01,400 --> 02:20:02,040
Yeah.

3549
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:04,000
I'm gonna have to mute her.

3550
02:20:04,060 --> 02:20:05,780
Her mic is so fucking loud.

3551
02:20:06,900 --> 02:20:07,540
Yeah!

3552
02:20:07,620 --> 02:20:09,000
Okay, my headset's charged.

3553
02:20:09,460 --> 02:20:10,420
Okay, there we go.

3554
02:20:12,360 --> 02:20:14,480
The mic was so loud.

3555
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:16,900
Yeah, why did I have to crash that set for the Overwatch game?

3556
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:20,520
Why did I have to crash that set for the Overwatch game?

3557
02:20:20,520 --> 02:20:21,340
Oh my god.

3558
02:20:21,340 --> 02:20:21,440
We're fine.

3559
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:25,340
Oh my god.

3560
02:20:25,620 --> 02:20:26,260
Oh my god.

3561
02:20:26,260 --> 02:20:27,800
I can't deal with...

3562
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:30,160
I can't do with my webcam mics.

3563
02:20:32,300 --> 02:20:32,940
Alright.

3564
02:20:35,220 --> 02:20:35,460
I died!

3565
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:36,580
I did it!

3566
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:40,640
I need a reload!

3567
02:20:41,660 --> 02:20:43,060
I need a reload!

3568
02:20:44,300 --> 02:20:45,060
We're doing it!

3569
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:47,880
Yes!

3570
02:20:48,500 --> 02:20:49,440
Look at that!

3571
02:20:49,740 --> 02:20:50,500
We're fine!

3572
02:20:50,520 --> 02:20:52,240
We also can definitely change CAS.

3573
02:20:52,380 --> 02:20:52,980
Where's the CAS?

3574
02:20:53,740 --> 02:20:54,520
Speed em up!

3575
02:20:54,920 --> 02:20:55,480
Yay!

3576
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:57,080
We're doing it!

3577
02:20:57,520 --> 02:20:58,080
Oh.

3578
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:01,620
She's so low!

3579
02:21:03,380 --> 02:21:03,940
Please!

3580
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:04,840
Shoot him!

3581
02:21:05,460 --> 02:21:07,740
Oh my god, the double hook though.

3582
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:08,920
That's actually gamer.

3583
02:21:09,320 --> 02:21:10,080
Right there.

3584
02:21:10,320 --> 02:21:11,300
Soldier is scared.

3585
02:21:12,120 --> 02:21:13,560
I know my one trick.

3586
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:15,400
Don't be scared.

3587
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:16,260
I'm here to protect you.

3588
02:21:16,920 --> 02:21:18,000
I can do this.

3589
02:21:19,180 --> 02:21:20,340
Oh my god.

3590
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:21,600
Yep.

3591
02:21:21,700 --> 02:21:22,500

3592
02:21:22,580 --> 02:21:23,180

02:21:32,860 --> 02:21:35,880
I'm floating school.

3599
02:21:36,400 --> 02:21:37,080
We're...

3600
02:21:37,080 --> 02:21:39,780

3601
02:21:39,960 --> 02:21:41,280
We're bottom enemy.

3602
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:44,800

3615
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:11,420
Oh no.

3616
02:22:11,580 --> 02:22:11,880

3617
02:22:12,040 --> 02:22:12,560
No.

3618
02:22:12,580 --> 02:22:13,500
I'm really low.

3619
02:22:14,220 --> 02:22:14,740

3620
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:18,360

3622
02:22:20,660 --> 02:22:22,120
Doom absolutely dies.

3623
02:22:22,180 --> 02:22:22,680
He has no block.

3624
02:22:22,980 --> 02:22:23,820
They have no Suzu.

3625
02:22:23,940 --> 02:22:24,320

3626
02:22:24,820 --> 02:22:25,600

Alright.

3630
02:22:31,580 --> 02:22:32,280
That's fine.

3631
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:34,700
Wait, did he alt it?

3632
02:22:34,940 --> 02:22:35,820
No, he didn't.

3633
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:36,700
Alright.

3634
02:22:38,300 --> 02:22:38,940

02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:39,840
We're fine.

3636

Everything is fine.

3637
02:22:41,700 --> 02:22:43,260
How did she live so long?

3638
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:44,420
It's called positioning.

3639
02:22:45,420 --> 02:22:46,420
You see that spray?

3640
02:22:46,420 --> 02:22:48,160
That's how I lived that long.

3641
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:49,480
Hahaha!

3642
02:22:52,860 --> 02:22:54,040

3655
02:23:13,380 --> 02:23:14,080
Oh no.

3657
02:23:16,420 --> 02:23:16,800
scared though.

3658
02:23:16,980 --> 02:23:19,880
He has no block.

3659
02:23:20,120 --> 02:23:20,820
Can we?

3660
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:21,840

02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:13,120
How do I travel?

3691
02:24:13,500 --> 02:24:13,960
Hahaha!

3692
02:24:13,960 --> 02:24:14,600
Yo.

3693
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:15,080
What?

3694
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:15,460
Okay.

3695
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:15,960
They just...

3696
02:24:15,960 --> 02:24:17,600
I'm the only person here!

3697
02:24:18,220 --> 02:24:19,640
You're the only one alive!

3698
02:24:21,020 --> 02:24:24,000
No I'm dead but why are they using fucking 80 ults?

3699
02:24:24,360 --> 02:24:24,880
Haha!

3700
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:26,220
That line.

3701
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:27,960
Alright.

3702
02:24:28,540 --> 02:24:29,100
Okay.

3703
02:24:29,500 --> 02:24:30,280
Here we go.

3704
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:31,880
This is it.

3705
02:24:32,060 --> 02:24:33,000
Oh my god.

3706
02:24:33,060 --> 02:24:34,080
She had...

3707
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:34,520
Oh!

3708
02:24:35,700 --> 02:24:38,060
I don't even have to look to anti.

3709
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:40,220
That's how good I am.

3710
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:40,960
Hahaha!

3711
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:43,200
I don't care if they go south.

3712
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:44,840
I'm gonna take the shit out of that guy.

3713
02:24:45,180 --> 02:24:45,780
Hahaha!

3714
02:24:47,220 --> 02:24:48,400
It's that easy.

3715
02:24:50,540 --> 02:24:51,260
Nice.

3716
02:24:51,460 --> 02:24:51,840
Nice.

3717
02:24:51,880 --> 02:24:52,060
Nice.

3718
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:54,240
Antis.

3719
02:24:54,260 --> 02:24:54,760
Antis.

3720
02:24:54,920 --> 02:24:55,420
Antis.

3721
02:24:55,880 --> 02:24:56,240
Antis.

3722
02:24:56,600 --> 02:24:57,320
Please.

3723
02:24:57,760 --> 02:24:58,480
Please.

3724
02:24:58,520 --> 02:24:59,800
I'm getting harassed.

3725
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:00,680
Please.

3726
02:25:02,420 --> 02:25:03,140
Please.

3727
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:08,400
Alright.

3728
02:25:08,660 --> 02:25:09,400
We're okay.

3729
02:25:11,660 --> 02:25:13,000
Oh god.

3730
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:15,400
I'm pushing Gaff.

3731
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:16,040
Oh!

3732
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:16,540
Goodbye!

3733
02:25:17,360 --> 02:25:17,880
Goodbye!

3734
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:18,360
Goodbye!

3735
02:25:19,140 --> 02:25:21,440
Are you talking about the antis or the antis?

3736
02:25:21,560 --> 02:25:22,820
Thank you for the super chat.

3737
02:25:22,900 --> 02:25:23,180
Thank you.

3738
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:23,700
Thank you.

3739
02:25:23,700 --> 02:25:24,100
Alright.

3740
02:25:24,920 --> 02:25:25,680
We're okay.

3741
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:26,380
See?

3742
02:25:26,520 --> 02:25:27,000
We're okay.

3743
02:25:27,460 --> 02:25:27,960
Yo.

3744
02:25:28,240 --> 02:25:31,120
You also sound like you're using a webcam mic.

3745
02:25:31,260 --> 02:25:32,200
Why are you talking?

3746
02:25:32,980 --> 02:25:34,800
Why are you talking?

3747
02:25:35,720 --> 02:25:36,240
Hahaha!

3748
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:36,800
Hahaha!

3749
02:25:38,780 --> 02:25:40,000
It fucking sucks!

3750
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:43,140
You lose your right to talk if you have a webcam mic.

3751
02:25:43,420 --> 02:25:43,940
It fucking sucks!

3752
02:25:44,600 --> 02:25:46,100
You lose your right to talk if you have a webcam mic.

3753
02:25:46,100 --> 02:25:49,130
I'm talking shit to the antis.

3754
02:25:49,610 --> 02:25:50,010
Okay.

3755
02:25:50,630 --> 02:25:51,230
Oh.

3756
02:25:51,590 --> 02:25:53,830
Ring around the Rosie.

3757
02:25:55,210 --> 02:25:56,410
Ring around...

3758
02:25:56,410 --> 02:25:57,030
Nah.

3759
02:25:57,070 --> 02:25:57,970
Something went wrong with it.

3760
02:25:58,050 --> 02:25:58,510
Please.

3761
02:25:59,650 --> 02:26:00,250
Please.

3762
02:26:01,450 --> 02:26:02,250
Get... No!

3763
02:26:02,750 --> 02:26:05,290
You don't even... You didn't even get...

3764
02:26:05,290 --> 02:26:05,510
Okay.

3765
02:26:05,510 --> 02:26:05,990
You killed him.

3766
02:26:06,050 --> 02:26:06,310
Alright.

3767
02:26:07,610 --> 02:26:09,430
Get me back to 21.

3768
02:26:09,890 --> 02:26:11,710
Oh shit.

3769
02:26:12,870 --> 02:26:12,990
Oh shit.

3770
02:26:12,990 --> 02:26:13,810
It's okay.

3771
02:26:14,090 --> 02:26:15,550
I have... I have...

3772
02:26:15,710 --> 02:26:16,650
A little.

3773
02:26:18,950 --> 02:26:19,590
Okay.

3774
02:26:19,710 --> 02:26:20,210
No.

3775
02:26:21,170 --> 02:26:22,950
It's not my fault!

3776
02:26:23,950 --> 02:26:24,430
It's not my fault!

3777
02:26:24,430 --> 02:26:25,330
I'm... Exactly!

3778
02:26:25,930 --> 02:26:26,990
Look at our DPS!

3779
02:26:27,310 --> 02:26:28,310
Look at our DPS!

3780
02:26:28,890 --> 02:26:30,450
They have negative kill.

3781
02:26:30,630 --> 02:26:30,990
KD!

3782
02:26:31,530 --> 02:26:33,030
The negative KD!

3783
02:26:34,030 --> 02:26:34,930
Not us!

3784
02:26:35,690 --> 02:26:36,330
Oh.

3785
02:26:36,410 --> 02:26:37,310
Don't let them push.

3786
02:26:37,490 --> 02:26:38,550
Don't let them push.

3787
02:26:39,410 --> 02:26:40,430
Don't let them push.

3788
02:26:40,430 --> 02:26:42,330
Yo, I'm not backing the fuck up.

3789
02:26:44,470 --> 02:26:45,950
Go, go, go, go!

3790
02:26:48,170 --> 02:26:48,650
Oh.

3791
02:26:48,750 --> 02:26:49,830
Not go for me though.

3792
02:26:50,310 --> 02:26:51,670
We lost a lead though.

3793
02:26:51,910 --> 02:26:53,030
It's fine that we let them tap.

3794
02:26:54,310 --> 02:26:55,090
There you go.

3795
02:26:56,930 --> 02:26:57,690
We're going.

3796
02:26:58,150 --> 02:27:00,150
We're going as hard as we can go.

3797
02:27:00,730 --> 02:27:01,210
Okay.

3798
02:27:01,370 --> 02:27:02,310
That's not...

3799
02:27:02,310 --> 02:27:03,210
Whoa!

3800
02:27:03,650 --> 02:27:06,070
Please don't... Please don't harass me.

3801
02:27:06,710 --> 02:27:07,370
Oh god.

3802
02:27:11,110 --> 02:27:13,870
If I keep Ruben up everything will be fine.

3803
02:27:16,180 --> 02:27:16,590
Please!

3804
02:27:16,850 --> 02:27:18,470
He's literally won!

3805
02:27:21,870 --> 02:27:22,690
Okay

3806
02:27:28,050 --> 02:27:28,870
How?!

3807
02:27:30,410 --> 02:27:31,230
How?!

3808
02:27:31,230 --> 02:27:34,410
I fucking anti this man twenty hundred times!

3809
02:27:37,570 --> 02:27:39,130
It's because they hate VTubers!

3810
02:27:39,490 --> 02:27:40,430
This is targeted!

3811
02:27:41,250 --> 02:27:42,250
You can tell!

3812
02:27:43,050 --> 02:27:45,190
This is 100% targeted.

3813
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:48,110
There's no way!

3814
02:27:54,820 --> 02:27:56,760
I swear to god.

3815
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:59,060
I swear!

3816
02:27:59,200 --> 02:27:59,660
I swear!

3817
02:27:59,780 --> 02:28:02,020
Who gave him a hundred punch?!

3818
02:28:02,020 --> 02:28:02,820
Who?!

3819
02:28:02,820 --> 02:28:03,680
Look at him!

3820
02:28:03,860 --> 02:28:05,420
His punch is at a hundred!

3821
02:28:07,540 --> 02:28:09,940
Who gave this to him?!

3822
02:28:11,720 --> 02:28:12,240
Focus on!

3823
02:28:13,400 --> 02:28:13,920
Okay.

3824
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:19,380
No, you need to say okay with a little more enthusiasm there.

3825
02:28:19,460 --> 02:28:19,860
Bro!

3826
02:28:20,240 --> 02:28:20,960
I'm funky!

3827
02:28:21,320 --> 02:28:22,460
Look at my TPS!

3828
02:28:22,660 --> 02:28:24,420
Seven versus twenty four!

3829
02:28:24,820 --> 02:28:25,060
Who cares?

3830
02:28:25,080 --> 02:28:25,640
That guy sucks!

3831
02:28:27,780 --> 02:28:29,640
Seven versus twenty four!

3832
02:28:32,900 --> 02:28:34,460
Somebody's not picking it up!

3833
02:28:34,500 --> 02:28:36,160
And by somebody I meant everybody!

3834
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:38,180
Except for me and Ruben.

3835
02:28:38,400 --> 02:28:40,380
I'm not going to be able to take much of a fight, man.

3836
02:28:40,700 --> 02:28:41,700
You go to hell!

3837
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:43,040
This ends now!

3838
02:28:43,980 --> 02:28:45,100
My god!

3839
02:28:50,240 --> 02:28:54,360
I don't trust my DPS enough to like give them heal.

3840
02:28:54,460 --> 02:28:55,480
Give them nano.

3841
02:28:56,140 --> 02:28:57,760
Like she did zero!

3842
02:29:00,880 --> 02:29:01,640
I am...

3843
02:29:03,300 --> 02:29:05,020
Keep me up and win, I promise.

3844
02:29:06,580 --> 02:29:07,620
What the fuck?

3845
02:29:07,960 --> 02:29:09,840
Wait, there was a murky here?

3846
02:29:09,880 --> 02:29:10,500
Really low!

3847
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:12,560
Our team got...

3848
02:29:13,160 --> 02:29:15,140
Yeah, our team got diffed hard.

3849
02:29:15,640 --> 02:29:16,980
That's a hard avoid.

3850
02:29:19,140 --> 02:29:19,680
No!

3851
02:29:19,940 --> 02:29:21,440
I can't avoid people!

3852
02:29:21,640 --> 02:29:22,480
I assume...

3853
02:29:22,480 --> 02:29:24,120
I assume like...

3854
02:29:25,140 --> 02:29:27,140
I assume like... I don't know.

3855
02:29:27,240 --> 02:29:28,580
Ruben will avoid them for me.

3856
02:29:29,360 --> 02:29:30,680
Alright, this is it.

3857
02:29:33,330 --> 02:29:35,000
Yeah, the ninja mercy out of nowhere.

3858
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:38,940
Guys, we're not gonna win this.

3859
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:39,480
I'm sorry.

3860
02:29:47,380 --> 02:29:47,900
I...

3861
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:50,480
I... I don't think this is winnable.

3862
02:29:50,740 --> 02:29:51,880
I'm not gonna lie.

3863
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:53,240
Yeah, yeah.

3864
02:29:53,320 --> 02:29:54,060
We lost two.

3865
02:29:54,300 --> 02:29:54,800
Yeah.

3866
02:30:00,040 --> 02:30:00,900
Ruben, we're...

3867
02:30:00,900 --> 02:30:04,420
We're doing everything we can to keep you alive, Ruben!

3868
02:30:04,780 --> 02:30:05,300
I...

3869
02:30:10,420 --> 02:30:12,040
I knew that was a winnable.

3870
02:30:12,420 --> 02:30:13,800
I... I...

3871
02:30:13,800 --> 02:30:16,440
I knew... You have late game.

3872
02:30:17,340 --> 02:30:22,420
Guys, no amount of healing can save a 9-12 and 9-13.

3873
02:30:22,880 --> 02:30:26,220
No amount of healing can save this fucking team.

3874
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:27,160
Like...

3875
02:30:30,060 --> 02:30:31,500
Negative DPS.

3876
02:30:32,980 --> 02:30:36,660
Both healers have 11k plus healing.

3877
02:30:36,840 --> 02:30:40,760
We can't save a fucking stupid DPS player.

3878
02:30:41,720 --> 02:30:45,560
The healer... Yeah, the DPS diff was... was just...

3879
02:30:45,560 --> 02:30:45,920
...

3880
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:46,680
...

3881
02:30:48,340 --> 02:30:48,860
...

3882
02:30:50,620 --> 02:30:52,000
It's just not... not it.

3883
02:30:53,160 --> 02:30:53,420
...

3884
02:30:54,220 --> 02:30:54,740
...

3885
02:30:57,240 --> 02:31:00,220
They just... It's just... It's just not it, guys.

3886
02:31:00,380 --> 02:31:01,200
It was just not it.

3887
02:31:02,200 --> 02:31:04,860
That's Overwatch matchmaking for you?

3888
02:31:05,320 --> 02:31:05,840
Yeah.

3889
02:31:06,960 --> 02:31:07,480
Yeah.

3890
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:08,840
Oh, nice!

3891
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:09,840
I avoided those people.

3892
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:13,560
Alright.

3893
02:31:19,460 --> 02:31:20,020
Alright.

3894
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:20,160
Alright.

3895
02:31:20,180 --> 02:31:23,020
Guys, I get one game where I can relax.

3896
02:31:23,360 --> 02:31:25,360
Guys, this is my one.

3897
02:31:26,020 --> 02:31:28,120
Guys, I can relax now.

3898
02:31:28,940 --> 02:31:29,920
It'll be fine.

3899
02:31:30,100 --> 02:31:31,080
I won't fuck around.

3900
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:31,900
I won't troll.

3901
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:36,720
I won't troll chat for reals.

3902
02:31:38,440 --> 02:31:39,000
Woooo!

3903
02:31:43,720 --> 02:31:44,280
Woooo!

3904
02:31:44,280 --> 02:31:45,760
Yeah, queues are fast.

3905
02:31:45,880 --> 02:31:46,780
I mean, it's prime time.

3906
02:31:47,140 --> 02:31:47,200
...

3907
02:31:50,600 --> 02:31:52,240
This was me, guys.

3908
02:31:52,560 --> 02:31:53,340
Look, see?

3909
02:31:53,860 --> 02:31:55,980
It sets the sunsets!

3910
02:31:56,380 --> 02:31:56,900
...

3911
02:31:56,900 --> 02:31:59,420
This was when I used to be good.

3912
02:32:00,760 --> 02:32:01,280
...

3913
02:32:03,480 --> 02:32:07,100
This was when people wouldn't target me because I was a VTuber.

3914
02:32:08,780 --> 02:32:09,300
...

3915
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:09,760
...

3916
02:32:12,260 --> 02:32:12,900
...

3917
02:32:14,040 --> 02:32:14,680
...

3918
02:32:17,820 --> 02:32:18,460
...

3919
02:32:18,460 --> 02:32:25,360
The old animated space... Guys, I'm only losing... I'm only losing because people are targeting me.

3920
02:32:25,640 --> 02:32:26,700
Say no now.

3921
02:32:27,400 --> 02:32:33,120
I used to win because I wasn't VTuber back then, so people would be nicer to me.

3922
02:32:33,500 --> 02:32:33,880
...

3923
02:32:35,980 --> 02:32:36,980
It's true.

3924
02:32:37,220 --> 02:32:37,760
... okay.

3925
02:32:38,720 --> 02:32:39,640
It's true.

3926
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:43,300
Oh my god, it's another Doom.

3927
02:32:45,560 --> 02:32:47,400
I might have...

3928
02:32:47,400 --> 02:32:48,300
Nooooo!

3929
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:52,280
Oh god.

3930
02:32:52,660 --> 02:32:53,720
Oh god, please.

3931
02:32:53,820 --> 02:32:55,620
I have 20 people on me.

3932
02:32:59,420 --> 02:33:01,140
Bro, what is going on?

3933
02:33:01,220 --> 02:33:03,420
Why is there so... Why do we have another...

3934
02:33:03,420 --> 02:33:05,280
Why is every... Oh, Sombra for Doom.

3935
02:33:05,480 --> 02:33:08,140
Okay, I was gonna say, why is everyone playing Sombra and I realized Doom.

3936
02:33:08,140 --> 02:33:08,940
Doom.

3937
02:33:09,960 --> 02:33:11,360
I'm going D.Va.

3938
02:33:12,420 --> 02:33:14,080
You just gotta beat up the back line.

3939
02:33:15,200 --> 02:33:16,100
Alright, here we go.

3940
02:33:19,400 --> 02:33:20,800
Honestly, I believe... He's gonna get a kill.

3941
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:22,180
I can... I believe.

3942
02:33:22,360 --> 02:33:24,220
Sombra, if you can touch, I can follow up.

3943
02:33:24,300 --> 02:33:24,900
Never mind, never mind.

3944
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:26,080
He's not gonna touch, man.

3945
02:33:26,220 --> 02:33:27,640
I don't think he can make it.

3946
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:30,700
Let's say, there's no way.

3947
02:33:32,600 --> 02:33:34,200
There's no way he makes it.

3948
02:33:37,900 --> 02:33:39,440
And we got a pick though!

3949
02:33:39,700 --> 02:33:40,500
Woah!

3950
02:33:41,080 --> 02:33:42,020
Look at him go!

3951
02:33:44,280 --> 02:33:44,840
See?

3952
02:33:45,760 --> 02:33:47,280
So fucking easy.

3953
02:33:47,960 --> 02:33:49,040
Please don't die.

3954
02:33:51,440 --> 02:33:53,020
So fucking easy.

3955
02:33:54,040 --> 02:33:55,840
Oh, please don't!

3956
02:33:57,420 --> 02:33:57,980
Guys.

3957
02:33:58,780 --> 02:34:04,200
I told you, every time... Every time I get a little bit confident, Doomfist is here to punch me.

3958
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:06,480
To like, slam me to the floor.

3959
02:34:07,340 --> 02:34:07,880
Easy.

3960
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:08,920
I got doomed.

3961
02:34:09,340 --> 02:34:11,080
I got fucking doomed, man.

3962
02:34:12,660 --> 02:34:13,700
I hate this.

3963
02:34:14,240 --> 02:34:15,560
The world isn't fair.

3964
02:34:16,040 --> 02:34:19,160
Playing Overwatch 2 made me realize the world just isn't fair.

3965
02:34:21,180 --> 02:34:24,360
The world is just unfair.

3966
02:34:28,100 --> 02:34:28,640
What?!

3967
02:34:28,640 --> 02:34:29,180
Bro!

3968
02:34:29,380 --> 02:34:30,600
I think she had...

3969
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:32,680
Oh my god, I think she wanted to stick me.

3970
02:34:32,740 --> 02:34:33,180
There's no way.

3971
02:34:34,180 --> 02:34:36,320
That was 100% a stick.

3972
02:34:36,920 --> 02:34:37,920
She's low.

3973
02:34:38,020 --> 02:34:39,120
This ends now.

3974
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:41,160
Oh my god.

3975
02:34:41,900 --> 02:34:42,800
There's no way.

3976
02:34:43,160 --> 02:34:43,240
There's no way.

3977
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:44,320
Soj is actually really low.

3978
02:34:44,640 --> 02:34:45,700
Oh, woah, woah.

3979
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:46,680
There is a way now.

3980
02:34:46,780 --> 02:34:47,700
There is a way.

3981
02:34:47,920 --> 02:34:48,520
Really one.

3982
02:34:48,920 --> 02:34:50,700
Oh, please grab your mech.

3983
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:51,420
Get your mech.

3984
02:34:51,420 --> 02:34:52,560
Please get your mech.

3985
02:34:52,560 --> 02:34:53,360
That's all I want.

3986
02:34:53,560 --> 02:34:54,900
Get your fucking mech.

3987
02:34:55,320 --> 02:34:55,820
Woah!

3988
02:34:57,620 --> 02:34:58,740
Here comes Jotan!

3989
02:34:58,800 --> 02:34:59,540
But don't kill me!

3990
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:01,720
I'm flopping.

3991
02:35:01,960 --> 02:35:02,600
Kill you.

3992
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:02,800
I'm not relaxed.

3993
02:35:03,240 --> 02:35:04,960
There's no relaxing in this game.

3994
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:09,840
There's no relaxing in this game, guys.

3995
02:35:12,340 --> 02:35:12,900
Alright.

3996
02:35:13,300 --> 02:35:14,980
Back to being my one trick.

3997
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:17,360
Back to one tricking.

3998
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:18,140
Here we go.

3999
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:21,260
And the mech ruined.

4000
02:35:23,620 --> 02:35:25,400
Back to my one trick.

4001
02:35:29,260 --> 02:35:29,960
It's fine.

4002
02:35:30,220 --> 02:35:31,140
We can kill Doom.

4003
02:35:31,140 --> 02:35:32,020
He's half HP alone.

4004
02:35:32,600 --> 02:35:33,880
Ruben, please peek me.

4005
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:38,340
Please peek me and please don't peek me in a way where I could die.

4006
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:43,180
I fucking... I'm dead.

4007
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:45,600
Please!

4008
02:35:46,020 --> 02:35:47,340
The Doom can still die.

4009
02:35:48,020 --> 02:35:48,860
Look at this guy.

4010
02:35:48,880 --> 02:35:49,380
He's half HP.

4011
02:35:49,980 --> 02:35:50,920
Look at him!

4012
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:52,260
Just look at him!

4013
02:35:52,260 --> 02:35:53,340
For the love of god!

4014
02:35:53,960 --> 02:35:55,340
Just look at him!

4015
02:35:55,780 --> 02:35:56,240
Okay.

4016
02:35:56,940 --> 02:35:58,720
I'll really lead back to Ana.

4017
02:35:59,080 --> 02:35:59,880
I hate it.

4018
02:35:59,960 --> 02:36:00,280
I got you.

4019
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:01,920
Kill Zen.

4020
02:36:02,740 --> 02:36:04,240
Please just look at him.

4021
02:36:04,500 --> 02:36:05,360
I swear.

4022
02:36:05,620 --> 02:36:08,940
I did not get targeted this hard when I played off stream.

4023
02:36:09,180 --> 02:36:10,220
I swear to god.

4024
02:36:11,200 --> 02:36:13,480
Things were so much easier.

4025
02:36:13,540 --> 02:36:13,840
Kill Mercy.

4026
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:15,100
She's really low.

4027
02:36:15,900 --> 02:36:17,040
Oh my god.

4028
02:36:17,240 --> 02:36:18,260
Leave me alone.

4029
02:36:18,980 --> 02:36:20,500
Just leave me alone.

4030
02:36:20,940 --> 02:36:22,380
I don't deserve this.

4031
02:36:22,520 --> 02:36:23,900
I've been a good person.

4032
02:36:26,020 --> 02:36:26,540
Nice.

4033
02:36:26,540 --> 02:36:26,920
Good kill.

4034
02:36:28,220 --> 02:36:28,980
Nice.

4035
02:36:33,060 --> 02:36:35,400
He wanted to sticky me so badly.

4036
02:36:35,660 --> 02:36:37,260
Oh my god.

4037
02:36:37,420 --> 02:36:40,220
He was ready to sticky me.

4038
02:36:42,120 --> 02:36:43,880
Woah woah woah woah woah.

4039
02:36:43,880 --> 02:36:45,300
Woah woah woah woah woah.

4040
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:48,980
Leave me alone!

4041
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:51,320
Holy shit!

4042
02:36:51,940 --> 02:36:53,460
I can't breathe!

4043
02:36:54,560 --> 02:36:56,320
Leave me alone!

4044
02:36:56,920 --> 02:36:56,960
I don't know.

4045
02:36:58,020 --> 02:36:58,700
Kill him!

4046
02:36:58,960 --> 02:36:59,560
Just kill him!

4047
02:36:59,700 --> 02:37:00,280
Just kill him!

4048
02:37:00,420 --> 02:37:01,860
This is where I die.

4049
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:03,200
This is where I die.

4050
02:37:03,440 --> 02:37:04,640
This is where I die.

4051
02:37:05,160 --> 02:37:05,880
Ring around.

4052
02:37:06,500 --> 02:37:07,280
Ring around.

4053
02:37:08,020 --> 02:37:09,040
He's so low.

4054
02:37:10,320 --> 02:37:10,760
Headshot.

4055
02:37:10,900 --> 02:37:11,500
Come on.

4056
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:11,920
Pass.

4057
02:37:12,120 --> 02:37:12,440
Half left.

4058
02:37:13,360 --> 02:37:13,940
I'm good.

4059
02:37:14,280 --> 02:37:14,900
Thank you.

4060
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:15,880
Kill Zen.

4061
02:37:16,900 --> 02:37:17,500
It's okay.

4062
02:37:17,700 --> 02:37:18,260
Thank you.

4063
02:37:18,520 --> 02:37:19,800
Somebody kill this man!

4064
02:37:23,460 --> 02:37:23,900
Please.

4065
02:37:23,980 --> 02:37:24,700
He's so low.

4066
02:37:24,880 --> 02:37:25,820
He's so low.

4067
02:37:25,820 --> 02:37:26,280
Oh shit.

4068
02:37:26,420 --> 02:37:28,260
I am unranked.

4069
02:37:28,760 --> 02:37:29,240
Please.

4070
02:37:30,740 --> 02:37:31,220
Please.

4071
02:37:31,240 --> 02:37:31,920
Can I cross?

4072
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:33,360
Do I have enough time to cross?

4073
02:37:34,100 --> 02:37:35,740
I'm walking in a straight line.

4074
02:37:35,840 --> 02:37:37,020
Please don't headshot me.

4075
02:37:40,460 --> 02:37:42,060
I'm walking in a straight line.

4076
02:37:44,580 --> 02:37:45,060
Please don't headshot me.

4077
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:45,780
Oh no.

4078
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:46,960
Oh no!

4079
02:37:52,740 --> 02:37:53,700
Oh no!

4080
02:37:53,700 --> 02:37:54,480
Leave me alone!

4081
02:37:55,080 --> 02:37:55,360
Leave me alone!

4082
02:37:55,620 --> 02:37:56,580
You're alone now.

4083
02:37:56,580 --> 02:37:57,340
Get in there.

4084
02:37:57,420 --> 02:37:57,520
Okay.

4085
02:37:57,520 --> 02:37:57,860
Alright.

4086
02:37:58,460 --> 02:37:58,940
Alright.

4087
02:37:59,000 --> 02:37:59,460
Here you go.

4088
02:38:00,940 --> 02:38:01,620
We're fine.

4089
02:38:03,560 --> 02:38:04,120
We're fine.

4090
02:38:04,120 --> 02:38:05,120
He's de-activated.

4091
02:38:07,720 --> 02:38:08,600
It's fine.

4092
02:38:08,600 --> 02:38:09,140
We're okay.

4093
02:38:09,700 --> 02:38:11,080
We're... We're okay guys.

4094
02:38:11,320 --> 02:38:12,280
Nothing to worry about.

4095
02:38:14,420 --> 02:38:16,000

02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:20,700
Pleast for the love of God.

4098
02:38:21,940 --> 02:38:23,060
Oh my God.

4099
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:23,720
I see him.

4100
02:38:23,840 --> 02:38:24,840
I see him.

4101
02:38:26,400 --> 02:38:28,740
I see him and I hear the tracer.

4102
02:38:29,620 --> 02:38:30,660
Let me live!

4103
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:33,720

4105
02:38:36,440 --> 02:38:37,100
Oh god.

4106
02:38:37,740 --> 02:38:38,480
It's fine.

4107
02:38:40,080 --> 02:38:40,600
That's good.

4108
02:38:41,560 --> 02:38:42,260
That's good.

4109
02:38:44,340 --> 02:38:46,500
They just have Mercy, Zen and Doom.

4110
02:38:46,640 --> 02:38:47,240
You win that.

4111
02:38:48,820 --> 02:38:49,840
EMP activated.

4112
02:38:50,820 --> 02:38:51,980
Oh my god please.

4113
02:38:52,660 --> 02:38:53,380

4116
02:38:57,960 --> 02:38:58,920
Kill the Zen!

Thank god.

4140
02:41:20,190 --> 02:41:22,790
Worst in your previous game.

4141
02:41:29,100 --> 02:41:31,280
Okay, that rock needed an anti.

4142
02:41:31,460 --> 02:41:32,300
Oh thank god.

4143
02:41:32,460 --> 02:41:33,700
Okay, our Sombra is actually...

4144
02:41:34,100 --> 02:41:34,960
shutting him down.

4145
02:41:35,140 --> 02:41:36,500
That makes me a lot happier.

4146
02:41:36,860 --> 02:41:37,680
Knowing that.

4147
02:41:38,420 --> 02:41:39,600
Knowing that it's working.

4148
02:41:42,360 --> 02:41:42,880
Nice!

4149
02:41:43,100 --> 02:41:43,880

02:41:43,960 --> 02:41:44,520

02:41:46,440 --> 02:41:47,460
Everything is fine.

4153
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:48,560
Everything is fine.

4154
02:41:49,100 --> 02:41:49,920
Enemy fire.

4155
02:41:50,620 --> 02:41:52,020
Their Zen is in danger.

4156
02:41:52,160 --> 02:41:52,740
Oh thank god!

4157
02:41:52,900 --> 02:41:53,640
Guys, guys!

4158
02:41:53,680 --> 02:41:54,340
He left me alone!

4159
02:41:54,780 --> 02:41:56,400
Now he's targeting Sombra!

4160
02:41:56,800 --> 02:41:58,460
He has a new person to hate!

4161
02:41:59,060 --> 02:42:00,480
Guys, that wall was so...

4162
02:42:00,480 --> 02:42:01,500
That wall needed healing.

4163
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:02,140
You guys don't understand.

4164
02:42:06,020 --> 02:42:06,920
Guys, I panicked.

4165
02:42:07,160 --> 02:42:07,320
Guys, I panicked.

4166
02:42:07,320 --> 02:42:07,420
Guys, I panicked.

4167
02:42:09,160 --> 02:42:10,460
I couldn't help it.

4168
02:42:10,500 --> 02:42:11,100
I panicked.

4169
02:42:11,260 --> 02:42:11,380
I couldn't help it.

4170
02:42:11,380 --> 02:42:11,380
I panicked.

4171
02:42:11,880 --> 02:42:12,940
It was so scary.

4172
02:42:12,980 --> 02:42:13,380
You don't understand.

4173
02:42:15,320 --> 02:42:17,000
Holy shit, he almost burned to death.

4174
02:42:17,140 --> 02:42:19,500
I literally got it just in time.

4175
02:42:22,830 --> 02:42:23,870
I literally got it just in time.

4176
02:42:23,870 --> 02:42:24,590
Is that Junkrat?

4177
02:42:24,910 --> 02:42:26,150
No, that wasn't.

4178
02:42:26,230 --> 02:42:26,810
That was just Doom.

4179
02:42:29,090 --> 02:42:30,130
Oh, GG's.

4180
02:42:30,250 --> 02:42:30,890
Oh, thank god.

4181
02:42:31,070 --> 02:42:31,570
He stopped!

4182
02:42:32,190 --> 02:42:32,710
Guys!

4183
02:42:33,810 --> 02:42:34,710
He stopped!

4184
02:42:34,850 --> 02:42:36,390
He stopped going for me!

4185
02:42:40,270 --> 02:42:42,850
Oh my god, the constant hack is actually...

4186
02:42:42,850 --> 02:42:44,230
Ring around the Rosie.

4187
02:42:44,410 --> 02:42:45,990
Ring around the Rosie.

4188
02:42:45,990 --> 02:42:50,450
Is that guy about people talking shit to his teammates?

4189
02:42:51,070 --> 02:42:51,110
No!

4190
02:42:54,910 --> 02:42:58,950
Guys, the moment I stop ring around the Rosie...

4191
02:42:58,950 --> 02:42:59,690
Guys, the moment I stop ring around the Rosie...

4192
02:42:59,690 --> 02:43:00,610
It was over.

4193
02:43:01,870 --> 02:43:07,210
Maybe I was confident.

4194
02:43:07,850 --> 02:43:08,490
And being like...

4195
02:43:08,490 --> 02:43:10,750
The doomfist is not aiming for me, clearly.

4196
02:43:12,310 --> 02:43:14,150
For one moment, I was...

4197
02:43:14,150 --> 02:43:15,570
He's not aiming for me.

4198
02:43:16,970 --> 02:43:17,530
But...

4199
02:43:18,210 --> 02:43:19,750
But he never forgets.

4200
02:43:22,010 --> 02:43:23,530
Is he gonna die?

4201
02:43:26,050 --> 02:43:26,770
Did he?

4202
02:43:26,890 --> 02:43:27,810
Did he totally die?

4203
02:43:28,110 --> 02:43:29,070
I couldn't tell.

4204
02:43:29,450 --> 02:43:32,850
I can't tell.

4205
02:43:32,990 --> 02:43:34,110
Do you think he totally died?

4206
02:43:34,530 --> 02:43:35,370
Oh god.

4207
02:43:35,630 --> 02:43:36,350
Oh god.

4208
02:43:38,030 --> 02:43:38,590
Alright,

4209
02:43:42,670 --> 02:43:44,870
so instead of the Doom targeting me...

4210
02:43:44,870 --> 02:43:47,070
Now it's like everybody else...

4211
02:43:48,010 --> 02:43:52,870
Everybody else is sending in a kill list.

4212
02:43:55,170 --> 02:43:57,110
I think this is the worst part of being supported.

4213
02:43:57,350 --> 02:43:58,690
Everybody just wants to kill you.

4214
02:44:00,990 --> 02:44:02,090
We did it!

4215
02:44:02,450 --> 02:44:02,910
Yay!

4216
02:44:04,790 --> 02:44:05,910
Who's the Zenyatta?

4217
02:44:06,170 --> 02:44:08,290
Did he fucking advertise his Twitch?

4218
02:44:08,550 --> 02:44:10,530
And then people are like, report the Zen?

4219
02:44:14,870 --> 02:44:14,970
Bro!

4220
02:44:18,970 --> 02:44:24,650
And he advertises this fucking Twitch when people are like, avoid the Zenyatta.

4221
02:44:25,490 --> 02:44:26,650
Report him.

4222
02:44:28,050 --> 02:44:29,730
A 30k bounty.

4223
02:44:30,090 --> 02:44:30,630
Alright.

4224
02:44:30,950 --> 02:44:34,930
Who do I... I got their Zen and Sim.

4225
02:44:35,430 --> 02:44:37,530
Okay, who do I avoid?

4226
02:44:40,070 --> 02:44:42,430
Alright, I'm gonna cleanse my avoids list.

4227
02:44:42,710 --> 02:44:43,350
Give me a sec.

4228
02:44:43,350 --> 02:44:45,670
Let me cleanse my avoids list.

4229
02:44:47,610 --> 02:44:51,890
I'm hiding the game so I don't put... I don't put the avoids list on blast.

4230
02:44:53,230 --> 02:44:53,710
No!

4231
02:44:53,810 --> 02:44:54,570
I can't!

4232
02:44:55,010 --> 02:44:55,490
Okay.

4233
02:44:55,910 --> 02:44:56,390
Unavoid.

4234
02:44:56,810 --> 02:44:57,290
Alright.

4235
02:44:58,110 --> 02:44:58,790
Let's see.

4236
02:44:58,970 --> 02:45:00,950
Now traveling to prepare for battle.

4237
02:45:02,230 --> 02:45:03,530
Select your hero.

4238
02:45:05,450 --> 02:45:09,630
I say it as like... I was like, oh I don't want to blast... put somebody on blast.

4239
02:45:09,750 --> 02:45:12,850
I say it as I fucking shit talked like 20 different people.

4240
02:45:12,850 --> 02:45:14,310
From this stream alone.

4241
02:45:15,990 --> 02:45:16,790
Is it time?

4242
02:45:20,170 --> 02:45:20,770
Is it?

4243
02:45:21,050 --> 02:45:22,110
Alright, here we go.

4244
02:45:22,830 --> 02:45:23,410
Is it?

4245
02:45:23,490 --> 02:45:25,370
Oh, we have... we have a...

4246
02:45:25,950 --> 02:45:27,330
We have a Junkrat.

4247
02:45:27,470 --> 02:45:28,010
That's fine.

4248
02:45:31,070 --> 02:45:31,590
It's okay.

4249
02:45:31,770 --> 02:45:32,170
It's fine.

4250
02:45:32,390 --> 02:45:32,810
It's fine.

4251
02:45:32,850 --> 02:45:34,790
You think we can get... we can climb here.

4252
02:45:36,810 --> 02:45:38,990
We can do this.

4253
02:45:40,850 --> 02:45:41,330
Yeah!

4254
02:45:42,810 --> 02:45:43,670
We'll be fine.

4255
02:45:46,830 --> 02:45:48,130
Everything will be fine.

4256
02:45:52,650 --> 02:45:54,690
I mean, you can tell he's a fucking specialist.

4257
02:45:54,850 --> 02:45:55,750
Look at his gold gun.

4258
02:45:56,010 --> 02:45:59,010
Look at my... Honestly, you can farm a gold gun in so fast.

4259
02:46:06,170 --> 02:46:08,810
I have a... I have a Dilare.

4260
02:46:09,050 --> 02:46:09,930
Oh my god.

4261
02:46:14,530 --> 02:46:15,250
Alright.

4262
02:46:15,430 --> 02:46:16,430
We're just gonna...

4263
02:46:17,670 --> 02:46:17,750
Ow.

4264
02:46:19,710 --> 02:46:20,430
How?

4265
02:46:22,350 --> 02:46:23,070
Nice.

4266
02:46:26,350 --> 02:46:27,070
Alright.

4267
02:46:27,210 --> 02:46:27,790
We're good.

4268
02:46:27,790 --> 02:46:27,830
We're good.

4269
02:46:29,650 --> 02:46:30,710
Oh, thank god.

4270
02:46:30,790 --> 02:46:30,990
Wait.

4271
02:46:31,390 --> 02:46:32,550
We take those.

4272
02:46:32,870 --> 02:46:33,290
Yay!

4273
02:46:34,970 --> 02:46:36,330
Free... free!

4274
02:46:37,250 --> 02:46:38,270
Free point!

4275
02:46:41,670 --> 02:46:42,670
Free point!

4276
02:46:45,610 --> 02:46:46,410
It's okay.

4277
02:46:46,590 --> 02:46:47,890
This next ante... watch this.

4278
02:46:50,290 --> 02:46:51,570
Watch this next ante.

4279
02:46:53,310 --> 02:46:53,990
Oh!

4280
02:46:55,490 --> 02:46:56,950
They never expected...

4281
02:46:58,050 --> 02:46:59,930
They never expected...

4282
02:47:02,510 --> 02:47:04,270
I told you!

4283
02:47:04,530 --> 02:47:05,790
Oh shit!

4284
02:47:06,670 --> 02:47:07,490
Oh shit!

4285
02:47:07,570 --> 02:47:08,670
There is people there.

4286
02:47:09,590 --> 02:47:10,930
We need SOS.

4287
02:47:13,770 --> 02:47:15,070
SOS right now.

4288
02:47:15,430 --> 02:47:16,170
Guys.

4289
02:47:19,030 --> 02:47:21,140
Don't ever expect the Spanish Inquisition.

4290
02:47:22,350 --> 02:47:23,090
Inquisition?

4291
02:47:23,410 --> 02:47:25,630
Inquis... Inquisition.

4292
02:47:26,210 --> 02:47:27,550
They're on as low...

4293
02:47:27,790 --> 02:47:28,210
Okay.

4294
02:47:28,470 --> 02:47:28,870
I'll probably live.

4295
02:47:28,930 --> 02:47:29,270
I'm fine.

4296
02:47:30,490 --> 02:47:30,910
There you are.

4297
02:47:31,650 --> 02:47:33,190
Ryan is coming in.

4298
02:47:34,530 --> 02:47:35,070
Oh!

4299
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:38,510
I hit those!

4300
02:47:38,910 --> 02:47:39,450
Inquisition?

4301
02:47:40,610 --> 02:47:41,150
Inquisition.

4302
02:47:41,370 --> 02:47:41,890
Yeah!

4303
02:47:42,590 --> 02:47:43,750
They never expected.

4304
02:47:46,830 --> 02:47:47,370
Oh!

4305
02:47:47,390 --> 02:47:47,950
I hear him.

4306
02:47:48,190 --> 02:47:49,510
I hear him on the right.

4307
02:47:52,190 --> 02:47:53,010
Three antis.

4308
02:47:54,410 --> 02:47:55,210
Oh shit!

4309
02:47:55,490 --> 02:47:55,850
Ryan!

4310
02:47:55,890 --> 02:47:56,170
Ryan!

4311
02:47:56,170 --> 02:47:56,410
Ryan!

4312
02:47:56,670 --> 02:47:56,670
Ryan!

4313
02:47:58,090 --> 02:47:58,630
Ryan!

4314
02:47:58,910 --> 02:47:59,010
Ryan!

4315
02:47:59,110 --> 02:47:59,110
Ryan!

4316
02:47:59,290 --> 02:47:59,290
Ryan!

4317
02:47:59,290 --> 02:48:00,950
Oh shit!

4318
02:48:01,550 --> 02:48:02,010
Please.

4319
02:48:02,050 --> 02:48:02,250
What?

4320
02:48:02,430 --> 02:48:03,630
Where is he going?

4321
02:48:03,770 --> 02:48:04,450
What is he doing?

4322
02:48:04,490 --> 02:48:05,070
What is this?

4323
02:48:05,150 --> 02:48:06,310
What is this gameplay?

4324
02:48:06,730 --> 02:48:08,370
They're Moira's really locos.

4325
02:48:09,050 --> 02:48:10,290
I don't think they know I'm here.

4326
02:48:14,950 --> 02:48:15,410
Ah!

4327
02:48:20,810 --> 02:48:21,470
I'm alive.

4328
02:48:22,810 --> 02:48:23,470
I'm alive.

4329
02:48:24,250 --> 02:48:25,310
We did it!

4330
02:48:26,050 --> 02:48:26,510
Yeah!

4331
02:48:27,290 --> 02:48:27,930
Yippee!

4332
02:48:28,970 --> 02:48:32,570
I saw my life flash before my eyes but we're okay!

4333
02:48:33,710 --> 02:48:34,730
We're okay!

4334
02:48:36,290 --> 02:48:38,550
I don't think they might know.

4335
02:48:39,730 --> 02:48:41,510
I didn't even have to use my ult.

4336
02:48:43,590 --> 02:48:47,550
I don't think they know I'm here so Ryan tries to pin.

4337
02:48:50,310 --> 02:48:51,190
Here we go.

4338
02:48:53,090 --> 02:48:56,290
Can we say that Joki is having her toxic...

4339
02:48:56,290 --> 02:49:01,470
Guys, the thing is, playing Overwatch, no matter how PMA you are...

4340
02:49:03,150 --> 02:49:09,070
When you're playing Overwatch, there's no way to be positive in Overwatch.

4341
02:49:13,150 --> 02:49:17,870
There's no way to be positive about anything when you're playing Overwatch.

4342
02:49:22,050 --> 02:49:22,810
Fine.

4343
02:49:23,550 --> 02:49:26,750
We can get back Masters here.

4344
02:49:29,110 --> 02:49:31,030
PMA streamers are not even PMA.

4345
02:49:31,110 --> 02:49:32,010
They're just passive aggressive.

4346
02:49:34,610 --> 02:49:35,910
Like, it's just a fact.

4347
02:49:37,230 --> 02:49:38,650
They're not actually positive.

4348
02:49:39,870 --> 02:49:42,010
They're just extremely passive aggressive.

4349
02:49:45,470 --> 02:49:46,310
It's true.

4350
02:49:49,150 --> 02:49:50,790
Woah, who is he trying to kill?

4351
02:49:50,830 --> 02:49:51,350
Our Junkrat?

4352
02:49:51,510 --> 02:49:52,330
Our Junkrat.

4353
02:49:53,790 --> 02:49:56,290
Bro, I don't even know who I'm trying to kill.

4354
02:50:00,190 --> 02:50:01,190
Oh, please.

4355
02:50:01,410 --> 02:50:01,890
Please.

4356
02:50:02,990 --> 02:50:03,970
It's so winnable.

4357
02:50:05,250 --> 02:50:06,530
Hog, just keep healing.

4358
02:50:06,730 --> 02:50:07,270
You're a hog.

4359
02:50:07,350 --> 02:50:08,230
You have regen.

4360
02:50:10,290 --> 02:50:11,250
He's so dead.

4361
02:50:11,750 --> 02:50:13,730
Our team was not ready to help.

4362
02:50:15,290 --> 02:50:16,890
Why is this guy typing at me?

4363
02:50:18,350 --> 02:50:19,330
Guys, please.

4364
02:50:19,430 --> 02:50:21,450
I don't want to be on point alone.

4365
02:50:22,090 --> 02:50:22,590
Guys.

4366
02:50:23,150 --> 02:50:24,070
Guys, please.

4367
02:50:33,250 --> 02:50:35,430
I'm sorry I saw the charge!

4368
02:50:35,910 --> 02:50:38,450
I saw the charge and I freaked out!

4369
02:50:43,650 --> 02:50:44,270
Nice.

4370
02:50:44,570 --> 02:50:45,470
Got my one.

4371
02:50:48,730 --> 02:50:49,350
Nooooo!

4372
02:50:49,830 --> 02:50:50,450
Nice.

4373
02:50:50,690 --> 02:50:52,410
Why is nobody on point?

4374
02:50:54,870 --> 02:50:57,090
He has to either shatter me or the Ilari!

4375
02:50:57,290 --> 02:50:58,230
He has to pick!

4376
02:51:01,290 --> 02:51:02,970
He has to pick one or the other!

4377
02:51:04,290 --> 02:51:05,390
And he picked neither!

4378
02:51:08,790 --> 02:51:12,810
Okay not gonna lie though, that guy got so much fucking health charge from that.

4379
02:51:16,340 --> 02:51:17,940
Oh god, I'm backing out.

4380
02:51:18,320 --> 02:51:19,520
Where's our fucking...

4381
02:51:20,360 --> 02:51:20,840
Woo!

4382
02:51:22,040 --> 02:51:23,360
Oh my god he lives?

4383
02:51:23,780 --> 02:51:24,660
More no fed?

4384
02:51:25,360 --> 02:51:26,940
Please, I don't wanna get shattered.

4385
02:51:27,060 --> 02:51:27,340
Please.

4386
02:51:27,640 --> 02:51:29,140
I don't wanna get shattered.

4387
02:51:29,320 --> 02:51:29,840
Please.

4388
02:51:30,780 --> 02:51:32,960
Somebody, somebody come over here!

4389
02:51:34,320 --> 02:51:34,840
Go!

4390
02:51:34,960 --> 02:51:35,240
Go!

4391
02:51:35,340 --> 02:51:35,740
I believe!

4392
02:51:36,160 --> 02:51:37,560
You versus Ryan!

4393
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:40,540
There you go.

4394
02:51:42,340 --> 02:51:43,520
He just TP'd.

4395
02:51:44,380 --> 02:51:45,440
Please don't shatter me.

4396
02:51:45,620 --> 02:51:46,680
Please don't shatter me.

4397
02:51:46,880 --> 02:51:48,680
This Ryan is not playing the game right now.

4398
02:51:49,080 --> 02:51:51,820
Ryan is not playing the game.

4399
02:51:52,300 --> 02:51:53,580
That poor Ryan.

4400
02:51:54,400 --> 02:51:55,360
Holy shit.

4401
02:51:55,780 --> 02:51:58,560
That Ryan is having the worst time of his life.

4402
02:51:59,200 --> 02:52:00,180
This poor guy.

4403
02:52:08,740 --> 02:52:09,820
No, don't shatter.

4404
02:52:09,980 --> 02:52:11,020
No, no, no, no, no.

4405
02:52:11,080 --> 02:52:11,680
I panicked left.

4406
02:52:11,800 --> 02:52:12,380
I panicked left.

4407
02:52:12,480 --> 02:52:13,000
I panicked left.

4408
02:52:16,700 --> 02:52:17,740
He's anti'd, please.

4409
02:52:18,700 --> 02:52:21,540
He's anti'd, just... He has to shatter you or me.

4410
02:52:21,700 --> 02:52:22,940
He has to shatter you or me.

4411
02:52:22,940 --> 02:52:24,200
He missed both!

4412
02:52:31,550 --> 02:52:33,430
He missed...

4413
02:52:34,510 --> 02:52:36,710
Fighting his demons.

4414
02:52:37,090 --> 02:52:40,010
The Ryan that replays the game.

4415
02:52:40,400 --> 02:52:42,210
He actually missed.

4416
02:52:42,650 --> 02:52:44,530
What a fucking loser!

4417
02:52:46,470 --> 02:52:48,950
He's blaming his teammate again.

4418
02:52:49,410 --> 02:52:50,970
Ryan, watch.

4419
02:52:52,500 --> 02:52:54,430
Wait, this is playing the game?

4420
02:52:55,170 --> 02:52:55,610
Wait...

4421
02:52:56,950 --> 02:52:58,050
That's so sad.

4422
02:52:58,350 --> 02:52:59,110
Wait, that's...

4423
02:53:01,050 --> 02:53:02,270
That's so sad.

4424
02:53:03,050 --> 02:53:04,950
That's the saddest game ever.

4425
02:53:05,350 --> 02:53:07,530
Guys, we just... Guys, I think it's possible.

4426
02:53:08,630 --> 02:53:10,890
We just need to win three games in a row.

4427
02:53:11,530 --> 02:53:12,730
And then we can do it.

4428
02:53:13,310 --> 02:53:16,670
We just need... We just need three games in a row.

4429
02:53:18,430 --> 02:53:19,550
Okay, this is it.

4430
02:53:20,230 --> 02:53:21,370
Three games in a row.

4431
02:53:21,410 --> 02:53:21,990
We got this.

4432
02:53:25,930 --> 02:53:26,990
I'm top 500.

4433
02:53:27,510 --> 02:53:28,990
I'm gonna make... Actually, no.

4434
02:53:29,050 --> 02:53:30,410
I can't make him lose top 500.

4435
02:53:30,830 --> 02:53:31,850
Because actually...

4436
02:53:33,210 --> 02:53:35,070
Wait, I'm gonna avoid our Junkrat.

4437
02:53:35,410 --> 02:53:35,850
Like...

4438
02:53:36,430 --> 02:53:37,590
Bro, like... I'm sorry.

4439
02:53:37,770 --> 02:53:41,010
But like... Even though we won the game, it's not because of our Junkrat.

4440
02:53:41,350 --> 02:53:43,230
There's... There's no... It's not...

4441
02:53:43,230 --> 02:53:45,670
It's definitely not because of our Junkrat.

4442
02:53:54,130 --> 02:53:55,090
It's okay, guys.

4443
02:53:55,590 --> 02:53:56,230
It's okay.

4444
02:53:56,230 --> 02:53:59,030
If she knows... I have 50 games, guys.

4445
02:53:59,250 --> 02:53:59,610
You know why?

4446
02:53:59,730 --> 02:54:02,150
Because I tried to speedrun to Masters before the stream.

4447
02:54:02,550 --> 02:54:05,850
Because I... This account started off as like Diamond.

4448
02:54:07,510 --> 02:54:09,870
I mean, it is Diamond now, but it was lower.

4449
02:54:10,370 --> 02:54:15,450
This account started off as D4 after placement.

4450
02:54:15,510 --> 02:54:18,530
And I tried to speedrun to Masters before the stream.

4451
02:54:18,710 --> 02:54:19,750
But it didn't work.

4452
02:54:22,830 --> 02:54:24,450
I didn't speedrun.

4453
02:54:28,290 --> 02:54:29,210
Alright, here we go.

4454
02:54:33,560 --> 02:54:34,160
Alright.

4455
02:54:35,080 --> 02:54:35,840
It's okay.

4456
02:54:36,560 --> 02:54:37,380
It's okay.

4457
02:54:37,480 --> 02:54:38,780
This is our new speedrun now.

4458
02:54:40,640 --> 02:54:41,940
This is our new speedrun.

4459
02:54:42,160 --> 02:54:47,720
It also like... Did it help that during the speedrun, I was only playing late-night queues?

4460
02:54:48,020 --> 02:54:49,020
I was...

4461
02:54:49,020 --> 02:54:58,460
It was only... Imagine an Ana wouldn't...

4462
02:54:58,460 --> 02:54:58,820
I'm not...

4463
02:54:58,840 --> 02:55:00,200
I'm not even on one trick.

4464
02:55:00,780 --> 02:55:02,560
I'm not even on one trick.

4465
02:55:02,680 --> 02:55:04,780
I can perfectly play other heroes.

4466
02:55:05,440 --> 02:55:10,280
It's just Ana is the most fun and also like my best one.

4467
02:55:12,980 --> 02:55:14,220
Chunk for Torb.

4468
02:55:14,260 --> 02:55:15,080
Torb is okay.

4469
02:55:15,140 --> 02:55:16,000
It's like an extra player.

4470
02:55:16,120 --> 02:55:17,600
It's like having like six players.

4471
02:55:19,500 --> 02:55:23,220
Guys, it doesn't help that I would play this game at like late-night queues.

4472
02:55:23,240 --> 02:55:27,460
And like late-night queues are absolutely the most terrible thing you can ever play on.

4473
02:55:28,840 --> 02:55:31,560
I mean, I used to die.

4474
02:55:32,420 --> 02:55:34,480
At such a delay, play 1-6.

4475
02:55:34,480 --> 02:55:34,540
We had only 40-50 games.

4476
02:55:34,540 --> 02:55:35,540
Okay, you guys got the idea.

4477
02:55:36,480 --> 02:55:37,500
And I am not even running a game.

4478
02:55:37,500 --> 02:55:40,720
I got a trabajame...

4479
02:55:42,120 --> 02:55:43,320
A rune box.

4480
02:55:43,320 --> 02:55:45,180
They use cutting beneficial to healing of the enemy.

4481
02:55:45,180 --> 02:55:45,360
They do.

4482
02:55:47,400 --> 02:55:49,440
I haven't seen anymore.

4483
02:55:49,640 --> 02:55:50,160
I have never seen one.

4484
02:55:50,200 --> 02:55:50,500
Okay, this one.

4485
02:55:51,340 --> 02:55:51,940
This one.

4486
02:55:51,940 --> 02:55:52,680
I've got to feed later.

4487
02:55:53,420 --> 02:55:54,200
Look at that.

4488
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:57,880
Another Susu.

4489
02:55:59,400 --> 02:56:01,120
Okay, let's hope he doesn't die.

4490
02:56:01,260 --> 02:56:02,480
Because he doesn't because he's gaming.

4491
02:56:04,520 --> 02:56:05,460
Gamer of the year.

4492
02:56:05,460 --> 02:56:06,080
F***ing course!

4493
02:56:07,700 --> 02:56:08,140
Yay!

4494
02:56:11,280 --> 02:56:12,680
Easiest game of my life.

4495
02:56:13,160 --> 02:56:14,160
We're gonna 2-0 them.

4496
02:56:14,520 --> 02:56:15,140
Right here.

4497
02:56:15,260 --> 02:56:16,060
I'm gonna bet on it.

4498
02:56:16,140 --> 02:56:18,860
I'll bet like $100 that we're gonna 2-0 them.

4499
02:56:20,060 --> 02:56:21,320
Look at that!

4500
02:56:21,420 --> 02:56:22,540
And the ante!

4501
02:56:22,680 --> 02:56:23,780
Who is she?

4502
02:56:24,240 --> 02:56:28,480
Even though like a top 500 Ana should be able to ante anything.

4503
02:56:28,740 --> 02:56:29,760
But like who is she?

4504
02:56:35,240 --> 02:56:36,280
Oh, s***!

4505
02:56:36,960 --> 02:56:37,620
It's okay.

4506
02:56:38,840 --> 02:56:39,880
We can...

4507
02:56:40,520 --> 02:56:42,140
Alright, I'm gonna back out.

4508
02:56:42,200 --> 02:56:43,480
I don't think we're gonna win this.

4509
02:56:44,620 --> 02:56:48,380
Wait, they're running Sigma?

4510
02:56:49,260 --> 02:56:50,280
That's cheating!

4511
02:56:51,020 --> 02:56:51,940
Oh, I'm gonna die.

4512
02:56:52,120 --> 02:56:52,860
No you're not!

4513
02:56:52,960 --> 02:56:53,620
No you're not!

4514
02:56:53,820 --> 02:56:55,160
I'm a f***ing healer!

4515
02:56:55,600 --> 02:56:57,140
No, I'm not the Sigma.

4516
02:56:57,380 --> 02:56:57,900
I can't...

4517
02:56:57,900 --> 02:57:00,720
I hate playing Ana against Sigma.

4518
02:57:05,940 --> 02:57:07,460
No he doesn't.

4519
02:57:09,140 --> 02:57:10,180
Oh no.

4520
02:57:10,340 --> 02:57:11,780
Please, please, please, please, please, please.

4521
02:57:12,880 --> 02:57:17,740
This is not perfect.

4522
02:57:18,860 --> 02:57:22,960
Okay, he just gave him like 100 HP, but that's okay.

4523
02:57:23,780 --> 02:57:25,260
Oh my god!

4524
02:57:25,280 --> 02:57:26,580
That poor Sigma!

4525
02:57:26,820 --> 02:57:28,940
Got cyberbullied so hard!

4526
02:57:32,700 --> 02:57:34,480
Shoot the Torp!

4527
02:57:34,560 --> 02:57:36,860
It would be so funny.

4528
02:57:36,940 --> 02:57:37,040
Beautiful.

4529
02:57:41,830 --> 02:57:42,810
Oh no.

4530
02:57:43,010 --> 02:57:46,050
That sleep would have hit if the Sigma didn't have shield.

4531
02:57:46,610 --> 02:57:48,290
It would have hit 100%.

4532
02:57:49,330 --> 02:57:50,090
F***ing hell.

4533
02:57:51,090 --> 02:57:51,970
Wait, is that...

4534
02:57:51,970 --> 02:57:53,370
Okay, we're fine.

4535
02:57:54,150 --> 02:57:54,890
Everything's fine.

4536
02:57:55,170 --> 02:57:55,390
Ow!

4537
02:57:55,550 --> 02:57:57,270
I got the Cassidy too.

4538
02:57:57,530 --> 02:58:00,310
Look at that.

4539
02:58:00,830 --> 02:58:04,590
All I'm saying is that because I'm a support, any...

4540
02:58:04,590 --> 02:58:07,890
any kills my DPS gets is my kill.

4541
02:58:10,830 --> 02:58:11,750
It's the rule of law.

4542
02:58:12,810 --> 02:58:14,190
Who is he ulting?

4543
02:58:14,470 --> 02:58:16,650
Oh, our poor f***ing Torp.

4544
02:58:16,790 --> 02:58:17,570
Wait, more no fade.

4545
02:58:19,070 --> 02:58:20,270
We can kill Sig.

4546
02:58:20,550 --> 02:58:20,950
Oh!

4547
02:58:22,890 --> 02:58:23,290
No!

4548
02:58:23,470 --> 02:58:24,510
No, no, no, no, no, no!

4549
02:58:25,210 --> 02:58:26,090
Not the shield!

4550
02:58:26,130 --> 02:58:26,650
Not the shield!

4551
02:58:27,070 --> 02:58:27,470
No!

4552
02:58:27,650 --> 02:58:29,290
Your fat ass took the anti!

4553
02:58:31,890 --> 02:58:33,370
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4554
02:58:33,590 --> 02:58:34,850
Cassidy, take the hit for me.

4555
02:58:36,550 --> 02:58:37,510
Cassidy, take the hit.

4556
02:58:38,170 --> 02:58:39,330
Take the hit, Cassidy.

4557
02:58:39,890 --> 02:58:41,450
I cannot contest right now.

4558
02:58:41,470 --> 02:58:41,890
Give me a sec.

4559
02:58:42,210 --> 02:58:42,870
It's okay!

4560
02:58:44,130 --> 02:58:45,250
I'll contest for us.

4561
02:58:45,250 --> 02:58:46,950
I'll show you one on me.

4562
02:58:47,350 --> 02:58:48,210
I'll punch him!

4563
02:58:48,430 --> 02:58:48,950
Nice.

4564
02:58:50,690 --> 02:58:51,730
Sorry, Torp.

4565
02:58:53,590 --> 02:58:55,330
Intentional body block, by the way.

4566
02:58:55,610 --> 02:58:56,670
Very intentional.

4567
02:58:57,710 --> 02:59:00,850
I'm body blocking for the other team.

4568
02:59:05,670 --> 02:59:06,270
It's okay.

4569
02:59:08,110 --> 02:59:08,630
See?

4570
02:59:08,630 --> 02:59:09,410
2-0.

4571
02:59:09,550 --> 02:59:10,550
Alright, who wants to bet?

4572
02:59:10,710 --> 02:59:11,730
We're gonna 2-0 them.

4573
02:59:13,330 --> 02:59:15,910
Guys, I don't have a problem with betting.

4574
02:59:16,970 --> 02:59:18,990
He wanted the healing.

4575
02:59:19,330 --> 02:59:19,590
Yeah.

4576
02:59:22,030 --> 02:59:22,590
Yay!

4577
02:59:22,850 --> 02:59:23,290
Yippee!

4578
02:59:25,330 --> 02:59:26,790
How are we overwatching?

4579
02:59:26,910 --> 02:59:29,790
I think we're like solid even at the moment.

4580
02:59:29,850 --> 02:59:31,770
If we win one more game, we're positive.

4581
02:59:32,050 --> 02:59:33,710
It only took us 3 hours.

4582
02:59:37,370 --> 02:59:39,190
We went through a lot.

4583
02:59:41,170 --> 02:59:45,230
If we win one more game, we have a positive.

4584
02:59:45,250 --> 02:59:46,350
Win rate.

4585
02:59:48,350 --> 02:59:50,350
It just takes one game.

4586
02:59:50,530 --> 02:59:52,290
Oh my god!

4587
02:59:52,410 --> 02:59:54,370
I'm living life by the edge!

4588
02:59:56,090 --> 02:59:57,430
Oh, they have a Zen.

4589
02:59:57,990 --> 02:59:58,930
Oh no.

4590
02:59:59,050 --> 03:00:00,310
Not a Zenyatta.

4591
03:00:00,930 --> 03:00:03,310
Only took 3 hours to break even.

4592
03:00:04,510 --> 03:00:05,630
It's just business.

4593
03:00:05,630 --> 03:00:06,450
Give me a sec.

4594
03:00:08,430 --> 03:00:09,070
Okay.

4595
03:00:09,130 --> 03:00:10,030
That's not fair.

4596
03:00:10,130 --> 03:00:12,470
That's not fair.

4597
03:00:12,470 --> 03:00:13,310
It's okay.

4598
03:00:13,750 --> 03:00:15,170
I'm also being shot at.

4599
03:00:16,990 --> 03:00:17,390
Oh no.

4600
03:00:17,390 --> 03:00:17,710
It's okay.

4601
03:00:17,790 --> 03:00:19,550
Hanzo might be the dumbest boy alive.

4602
03:00:19,790 --> 03:00:20,690
Oh wait, he's alive?

4603
03:00:22,910 --> 03:00:24,370
How the fuck is he alive?

4604
03:00:25,350 --> 03:00:25,910
It's okay.

4605
03:00:26,010 --> 03:00:26,370
I got you.

4606
03:00:26,410 --> 03:00:28,230
Oh, I got you.

4607
03:00:28,270 --> 03:00:28,650
I got you.

4608
03:00:28,670 --> 03:00:29,550
I got you.

4609
03:00:29,790 --> 03:00:30,910
I have to reload.

4610
03:00:32,990 --> 03:00:33,750
I got you.

4611
03:00:33,810 --> 03:00:34,210
I got you.

4612
03:00:34,230 --> 03:00:34,690
I got you.

4613
03:00:35,490 --> 03:00:36,530
How are we alive?

4614
03:00:37,350 --> 03:00:37,750
Nice.

4615
03:00:40,370 --> 03:00:41,850
This game is so trash.

4616
03:00:42,170 --> 03:00:44,250
Yes, but what else do I have left?

4617
03:00:44,510 --> 03:00:45,550
Yes, but what else do I have left?

4618
03:00:48,230 --> 03:00:49,250
What was it?

4619
03:00:49,310 --> 03:00:51,410
Marvel Rivals waiting room right now.

4620
03:00:51,570 --> 03:00:51,870
What was it?

4621
03:00:53,870 --> 03:00:57,990
This is my waiting room for the Marvel shooter game.

4622
03:01:00,090 --> 03:01:01,370
They have a hog now.

4623
03:01:02,430 --> 03:01:03,510
Okay, they know I'm here.

4624
03:01:05,570 --> 03:01:07,350
Oh shit, no shit really?

4625
03:01:07,610 --> 03:01:07,730
Oh shit, no shit really?

4626
03:01:07,750 --> 03:01:07,970
Ow.

4627
03:01:08,990 --> 03:01:13,070
All I'm saying is that if you had streamer mode...

4628
03:01:13,070 --> 03:01:15,010
Don't worry, they won't know I'm right here.

4629
03:01:15,150 --> 03:01:15,430
Don't worry, they won't know I'm right here.

4630
03:01:15,430 --> 03:01:16,270
Like right here.

4631
03:01:16,490 --> 03:01:17,790
They will not know.

4632
03:01:17,810 --> 03:01:18,830
They will not look down.

4633
03:01:19,930 --> 03:01:20,530
Watch.

4634
03:01:21,270 --> 03:01:21,810
Watch.

4635
03:01:24,490 --> 03:01:25,530
Oh shit!

4636
03:01:25,690 --> 03:01:26,610
He turned around!

4637
03:01:27,030 --> 03:01:27,870
He turned around!

4638
03:01:30,810 --> 03:01:32,450
I told you.

4639
03:01:32,930 --> 03:01:34,430
They don't know.

4640
03:01:35,470 --> 03:01:37,010
They will never know.

4641
03:01:37,750 --> 03:01:38,090
I told you.

4642
03:01:38,890 --> 03:01:40,330
I knew they wouldn't know.

4643
03:01:40,630 --> 03:01:42,830
I got you.

4644
03:01:42,830 --> 03:01:42,990
Nice.

4645
03:01:44,110 --> 03:01:44,130
Nice.

4646
03:01:48,370 --> 03:01:49,010
Kill him.

4647
03:01:49,070 --> 03:01:49,270
Kill him.

4648
03:01:49,530 --> 03:01:50,710
Oh god.

4649
03:01:52,010 --> 03:01:53,010
He's coming over.

4650
03:01:53,670 --> 03:01:54,850
Wait, what the fuck?

4651
03:01:55,270 --> 03:01:56,410
What is this soldier doing?

4652
03:01:56,770 --> 03:01:58,850
What is this soldier doing here?

4653
03:01:59,010 --> 03:02:01,810
Why did our fucking Ana get killed like that?

4654
03:02:01,930 --> 03:02:02,530
What the fuck?

4655
03:02:02,870 --> 03:02:04,930
I got jumped down from the top rope.

4656
03:02:04,930 --> 03:02:07,070
Where was my bodyguard?

4657
03:02:07,510 --> 03:02:09,730
That was my first step.

4658
03:02:09,790 --> 03:02:12,870
I hope the Cassidy dies in game.

4659
03:02:13,110 --> 03:02:14,070
I hope the Cassidy dies in game.

4660
03:02:14,570 --> 03:02:17,270
We should all be 1-1-1-1-1.

4661
03:02:20,410 --> 03:02:20,970
Alright.

4662
03:02:21,690 --> 03:02:23,010
This is so un-changed.

4663
03:02:24,150 --> 03:02:24,710
Okay.

4664
03:02:27,670 --> 03:02:28,230
Okay.

4665
03:02:29,490 --> 03:02:30,050
That's fine.

4666
03:02:30,450 --> 03:02:30,470
This is perfectly fine.

4667
03:02:30,890 --> 03:02:32,230
Yes, it's perfectly fine.

4668
03:02:32,230 --> 03:02:33,830
This is not fine anymore.

4669
03:02:33,990 --> 03:02:35,530
This is not fine anymore.

4670
03:02:36,810 --> 03:02:37,950
I would have...

4671
03:02:37,950 --> 03:02:38,530
Okay.

4672
03:02:38,650 --> 03:02:43,030
All I'm saying is that I could have actually 100% killed the Cure girl.

4673
03:02:43,210 --> 03:02:44,730
With just my game.

4674
03:02:46,850 --> 03:02:47,450
GG.

4675
03:02:47,670 --> 03:02:47,910
Nice.

4676
03:02:48,030 --> 03:02:48,610
No!

4677
03:02:48,870 --> 03:02:49,930
The Cassidy lived!

4678
03:02:50,650 --> 03:02:52,530
Press all the Qs.

4679
03:02:52,750 --> 03:02:55,590
I don't know how I lived there.

4680
03:02:56,170 --> 03:02:56,470
Guys!

4681
03:02:57,130 --> 03:02:59,410
We got a positive win rate!

4682
03:02:59,510 --> 03:03:00,330
We were here!

4683
03:03:03,890 --> 03:03:04,590
Guys!

4684
03:03:05,350 --> 03:03:06,770
We were here!

4685
03:03:07,310 --> 03:03:07,970
Guys!

4686
03:03:07,970 --> 03:03:09,670
A positive win rate!

4687
03:03:13,090 --> 03:03:15,330
The Doki luck is real.

4688
03:03:15,510 --> 03:03:15,710
The Doki luck is real.

4689
03:03:15,710 --> 03:03:15,950
The Doki luck is real.

4690
03:03:16,650 --> 03:03:18,210
I can't believe it.

4691
03:03:18,270 --> 03:03:18,750
For today.

4692
03:03:19,070 --> 03:03:21,830
We got a positive win rate for today.

4693
03:03:23,930 --> 03:03:25,090
Oh my god!

4694
03:03:25,370 --> 03:03:27,130
I just need two more wins!

4695
03:03:27,430 --> 03:03:28,430
It's so possible!

4696
03:03:29,570 --> 03:03:30,310
We got a positive win rate for today!

4697
03:03:30,330 --> 03:03:30,850
We can do it!

4698
03:03:32,590 --> 03:03:33,390
It's like...

4699
03:03:33,390 --> 03:03:34,290
Oh my god!

4700
03:03:34,330 --> 03:03:35,210
It's so winnable!

4701
03:03:35,510 --> 03:03:36,750
I believe in us!

4702
03:03:37,270 --> 03:03:38,250
There's no way!

4703
03:03:38,570 --> 03:03:41,010
It's not like we're gonna lose like five games in a row.

4704
03:03:41,350 --> 03:03:41,870
Guys!

4705
03:03:41,930 --> 03:03:43,030
It will take me like...

4706
03:03:43,030 --> 03:03:44,650
I bet you in four hours!

4707
03:03:44,930 --> 03:03:45,990
In four hours!

4708
03:03:46,650 --> 03:03:47,730
We can...

4709
03:03:47,730 --> 03:03:53,290
We can finally have a positive win rate!

4710
03:03:53,790 --> 03:03:54,110
We

4711
03:03:57,310 --> 03:03:58,710
can finally have a positive win rate!

4712
03:03:58,710 --> 03:03:59,130
This is it!

4713
03:03:59,490 --> 03:04:00,270
I believe!

4714
03:04:00,770 --> 03:04:04,830
Okay, I'll let you guys see how bad my Kiriko win rate is.

4715
03:04:05,050 --> 03:04:05,950
I'll let you guys see.

4716
03:04:06,090 --> 03:04:07,990
It's actually pretty fucked up.

4717
03:04:12,450 --> 03:04:13,430
It's pretty bad.

4718
03:04:14,530 --> 03:04:18,950
This is my most played int for this season.

4719
03:04:19,230 --> 03:04:20,170
It's pretty bad.

4720
03:04:27,430 --> 03:04:28,790
It's really bad.

4721
03:04:29,890 --> 03:04:30,530
Okay.

4722
03:04:32,530 --> 03:04:33,170
Anyway.

4723
03:04:33,450 --> 03:04:35,330
Now speaking of Kiriko.

4724
03:04:35,510 --> 03:04:36,250
Actually I won't.

4725
03:04:36,290 --> 03:04:37,150
I don't wanna play Kiriko.

4726
03:04:37,350 --> 03:04:39,890
I actually don't wanna play Kiriko.

4727
03:04:40,210 --> 03:04:40,630
Bro!

4728
03:04:40,710 --> 03:04:42,670
I hate this map so much!

4729
03:04:43,210 --> 03:04:44,890
I actually hate this map.

4730
03:04:45,070 --> 03:04:46,250
Like so much.

4731
03:04:48,550 --> 03:04:50,090
I wish they would...

4732
03:04:50,090 --> 03:04:52,110
remove this map.

4733
03:04:52,730 --> 03:04:53,310
Okay!

4734
03:04:54,610 --> 03:04:56,330
21 and like 3 at the...

4735
03:04:56,330 --> 03:04:57,590
Right now!

4736
03:04:59,510 --> 03:05:00,630
I swear!

4737
03:05:01,130 --> 03:05:03,390
I swear it's not because of me though.

4738
03:05:03,610 --> 03:05:05,290
Every time I lose as...

4739
03:05:05,290 --> 03:05:07,910
Every time I lose as Kiriko, it's not me.

4740
03:05:08,590 --> 03:05:10,010
It was never me.

4741
03:05:12,530 --> 03:05:13,270
I swear.

4742
03:05:13,490 --> 03:05:14,670
I swear guys.

4743
03:05:18,730 --> 03:05:20,650
It's never a me issue.

4744
03:05:20,810 --> 03:05:21,590
All I'm saying.

4745
03:05:26,030 --> 03:05:27,090
Here we go!

4746
03:05:27,810 --> 03:05:28,370
Yay!

4747
03:05:28,930 --> 03:05:30,690
I hate this map though.

4748
03:05:31,110 --> 03:05:32,530
I hate this map so much.

4749
03:05:34,350 --> 03:05:34,870
Ugh!

4750
03:05:35,030 --> 03:05:35,850
It's not me.

4751
03:05:36,050 --> 03:05:38,410
It's my tank and DPS and other support.

4752
03:05:39,510 --> 03:05:40,030
Hello!

4753
03:05:41,890 --> 03:05:42,410
Alright.

4754
03:05:45,270 --> 03:05:45,790
Wait.

4755
03:05:45,930 --> 03:05:46,990
I went the wrong way.

4756
03:05:47,170 --> 03:05:47,610
I'm sorry.

4757
03:05:48,130 --> 03:05:49,950
I don't know why I went this way.

4758
03:05:50,770 --> 03:05:52,950
My actual teammates are over here.

4759
03:05:53,210 --> 03:05:53,530
Oh!

4760
03:05:53,710 --> 03:05:54,290
That's a good!

4761
03:05:56,770 --> 03:05:58,030
What the f...

4762
03:05:58,030 --> 03:06:01,210
Where did the chunker came from?

4763
03:06:02,130 --> 03:06:03,130
Holy shit!

4764
03:06:03,690 --> 03:06:05,670
Where did he come from?

4765
03:06:06,170 --> 03:06:07,750
What the f...

4766
03:06:07,750 --> 03:06:11,190
What the f...

4767
03:06:11,190 --> 03:06:12,170
What the f...

4768
03:06:12,170 --> 03:06:12,190
Alright.

4769
03:06:13,050 --> 03:06:15,550
This is a little awkward that we lost that.

4770
03:06:15,690 --> 03:06:17,050
We got the initial pick too!

4771
03:06:17,730 --> 03:06:18,190
We got the initial pick too!

4772
03:06:18,190 --> 03:06:18,290
Wait.

4773
03:06:18,290 --> 03:06:19,030
I don't know if it's Sol.

4774
03:06:19,110 --> 03:06:20,590
It's a streamer mode name.

4775
03:06:20,750 --> 03:06:21,350
But like...

4776
03:06:21,970 --> 03:06:24,150
If it's not, then he's actually...

4777
03:06:25,150 --> 03:06:25,990
I'm scared.

4778
03:06:27,570 --> 03:06:28,710
I'm so scared.

4779
03:06:29,710 --> 03:06:30,750
I'm so scared.

4780
03:06:30,910 --> 03:06:31,630
I leave.

4781
03:06:31,870 --> 03:06:32,530
I leave.

4782
03:06:32,990 --> 03:06:35,530
Guys, I might lose my positive win rate right here.

4783
03:06:38,330 --> 03:06:39,350
I have a plan.

4784
03:06:39,490 --> 03:06:40,070
I wanna go under.

4785
03:06:40,670 --> 03:06:41,850
I might lose...

4786
03:06:41,850 --> 03:06:42,350
Guys...

4787
03:06:42,350 --> 03:06:46,750
There might be a moment where I lose my positive win rate.

4788
03:06:48,390 --> 03:06:48,950
Maybe.

4789
03:06:50,170 --> 03:06:51,030
It's possible.

4790
03:06:52,630 --> 03:06:53,630
It's possible.

4791
03:06:53,650 --> 03:06:54,070
It's possible.

4792
03:06:54,150 --> 03:06:55,650
And then he's...

4793
03:06:55,650 --> 03:06:56,050
Hold up.

4794
03:06:56,050 --> 03:06:56,330
Leave him.

4795
03:06:56,530 --> 03:06:59,110
Did we leave him?

4796
03:06:59,250 --> 03:07:00,310
Did we leave him?

4797
03:07:00,430 --> 03:07:01,770
I don't think we left him.

4798
03:07:02,450 --> 03:07:03,490
I don't think...

4799
03:07:03,490 --> 03:07:04,210
Please!

4800
03:07:04,410 --> 03:07:05,230
Cleanse me!

4801
03:07:06,330 --> 03:07:07,090
I'm important!

4802
03:07:09,750 --> 03:07:11,530
Guys, I didn't get cleansed.

4803
03:07:12,770 --> 03:07:13,850
I didn't get...

4804
03:07:13,850 --> 03:07:15,210
Guys, I didn't get cleansed.

4805
03:07:16,430 --> 03:07:17,290
I don't...

4806
03:07:18,050 --> 03:07:18,810
What cleanse?

4807
03:07:20,090 --> 03:07:21,850
Our Kiriko only cleansed themselves.

4808
03:07:22,510 --> 03:07:23,030
See?

4809
03:07:23,150 --> 03:07:24,130
This Kiriko looks...

4810
03:07:24,150 --> 03:07:26,850
like a person with a 29% win rate.

4811
03:07:27,070 --> 03:07:27,870
Not gonna lie.

4812
03:07:30,310 --> 03:07:33,130
I bet you that Kiriko has a worse win rate than me.

4813
03:07:33,250 --> 03:07:33,930
on Kiriko.

4814
03:07:36,450 --> 03:07:37,490
I was fucking around.

4815
03:07:37,570 --> 03:07:38,050
I was fucking around!

4816
03:07:38,770 --> 03:07:40,690
Why would a Samba be right there?

4817
03:07:40,890 --> 03:07:42,650
Why would she be right here?

4818
03:07:43,310 --> 03:07:43,790
Guys!

4819
03:07:49,510 --> 03:07:52,430
Like, why would she be right here?

4820
03:07:52,930 --> 03:07:54,070
Why would she be right here?

4821
03:07:56,650 --> 03:07:57,890
Oh my god!

4822
03:07:58,470 --> 03:07:59,070
Oh my god!

4823
03:08:00,570 --> 03:08:01,530
Like, how?!

4824
03:08:01,530 --> 03:08:01,990
Like, how?!

4825
03:08:01,990 --> 03:08:04,070
How do you, like, add her a spawn?!

4826
03:08:04,750 --> 03:08:06,090
How do you, like, add her a spawn?!

4827
03:08:08,130 --> 03:08:09,430
Okay, here we go.

4828
03:08:10,250 --> 03:08:11,770
Just Samba things.

4829
03:08:12,330 --> 03:08:13,090
I swear.

4830
03:08:13,350 --> 03:08:13,990
Target it.

4831
03:08:14,210 --> 03:08:15,670
100% target it.

4832
03:08:15,710 --> 03:08:16,310
There's no way.

4833
03:08:16,510 --> 03:08:18,230
100% target it.

4834
03:08:18,230 --> 03:08:18,230
There's no way.

4835
03:08:18,230 --> 03:08:19,670
There's no way it's not targeted.

4836
03:08:19,990 --> 03:08:21,110
There's no way it's not targeted.

4837
03:08:22,130 --> 03:08:24,830
I'm just gonna...

4838
03:08:24,830 --> 03:08:26,390
I'm just gonna...

4839
03:08:26,390 --> 03:08:26,570
Go.

4840
03:08:26,810 --> 03:08:27,650
Go.

4841
03:08:29,030 --> 03:08:29,870
Go.

4842
03:08:30,230 --> 03:08:30,590
Go.

4843
03:08:35,070 --> 03:08:36,070
I'm dead.

4844
03:08:36,970 --> 03:08:38,290
No more go.

4845
03:08:38,730 --> 03:08:40,110
No more go.

4846
03:08:40,310 --> 03:08:41,710
They're all low.

4847
03:08:42,490 --> 03:08:43,670
They're all low.

4848
03:08:43,670 --> 03:08:45,470
Oh my god!

4849
03:08:46,410 --> 03:08:46,830
Oh my god!

4850
03:08:46,850 --> 03:08:47,690
Alright.

4851
03:08:47,690 --> 03:08:47,810
Alright.

4852
03:08:48,010 --> 03:08:48,530
Good kill.

4853
03:08:48,750 --> 03:08:50,830
I am going to go Zenyatta.

4854
03:08:52,170 --> 03:08:52,690
What?!

4855
03:08:52,690 --> 03:08:53,690
For the Widow?!

4856
03:08:54,210 --> 03:08:55,750
Did she just solo ult to get you?

4857
03:08:55,750 --> 03:08:56,110
Yeah!

4858
03:08:56,110 --> 03:08:57,370
For Widow?!

4859
03:08:57,990 --> 03:08:58,710
That's crazy.

4860
03:08:59,750 --> 03:09:01,630
That's... kinda fucked up.

4861
03:09:01,690 --> 03:09:03,090
Goodbye, positive win rate.

4862
03:09:03,310 --> 03:09:03,330
I don't need to kill her.

4863
03:09:03,350 --> 03:09:04,150
I got her in my heal.

4864
03:09:04,390 --> 03:09:09,450
It was nice having a positive win rate for a little bit, though.

4865
03:09:09,610 --> 03:09:10,130
It was nice having a positive win rate for a little bit, though.

4866
03:09:10,130 --> 03:09:11,490
I had a good time with that.

4867
03:09:12,490 --> 03:09:13,910
It felt really good.

4868
03:09:13,910 --> 03:09:15,030
For like one second.

4869
03:09:15,030 --> 03:09:16,590
They're taking the top right now.

4870
03:09:16,730 --> 03:09:18,090
Which means we can go top.

4871
03:09:18,670 --> 03:09:19,530
Wait a second!

4872
03:09:19,670 --> 03:09:20,110
You got a touch!

4873
03:09:20,390 --> 03:09:21,310
Oh shit!

4874
03:09:21,470 --> 03:09:22,010
I didn't realize.

4875
03:09:23,030 --> 03:09:23,630
That's fine.

4876
03:09:23,690 --> 03:09:24,270
We weren't winning that fight.

4877
03:09:24,630 --> 03:09:25,030
Alright.

4878
03:09:25,990 --> 03:09:27,030
I'm gonna die.

4879
03:09:27,290 --> 03:09:28,110
Might as well.

4880
03:09:29,390 --> 03:09:30,690
Might as well.

4881
03:09:32,370 --> 03:09:32,770
Guys!

4882
03:09:33,070 --> 03:09:34,070
No, I have an idea.

4883
03:09:34,730 --> 03:09:35,770
I have an idea.

4884
03:09:37,050 --> 03:09:38,110
This is it.

4885
03:09:38,570 --> 03:09:39,790
This is the plan.

4886
03:09:40,070 --> 03:09:40,730
This is it.

4887
03:09:40,850 --> 03:09:41,350
This is it.

4888
03:09:41,650 --> 03:09:42,750
This has to be the plan.

4889
03:09:42,870 --> 03:09:43,070
Right?

4890
03:09:45,190 --> 03:09:46,090
This is it.

4891
03:09:46,650 --> 03:09:47,830
There's no way.

4892
03:09:48,350 --> 03:09:50,610
It would be so funny if I get railed right here.

4893
03:09:51,090 --> 03:09:52,450
It would be so funny.

4894
03:09:54,030 --> 03:09:54,830
Two kills!

4895
03:09:54,930 --> 03:09:55,230
Two kills!

4896
03:09:55,250 --> 03:09:55,570
This is it!

4897
03:09:55,610 --> 03:09:56,410
I knew it!

4898
03:09:56,690 --> 03:09:59,250
I fucking knew this was the plan.

4899
03:10:00,150 --> 03:10:01,870
I miss the character.

4900
03:10:02,890 --> 03:10:04,330
I knew it.

4901
03:10:06,130 --> 03:10:07,670
I knew it, guys.

4902
03:10:07,790 --> 03:10:09,210
This was the plan all along.

4903
03:10:12,670 --> 03:10:13,190
Alright.

4904
03:10:14,110 --> 03:10:15,010
All we have to do is...

4905
03:10:15,030 --> 03:10:17,320
Make sure our Widow is pocketed.

4906
03:10:17,690 --> 03:10:18,370
Make sure our Widow is pocketed.

4907
03:10:19,070 --> 03:10:20,210
What the fuck?

4908
03:10:20,270 --> 03:10:22,350
Why is there three people here?

4909
03:10:22,430 --> 03:10:23,230
Behind us.

4910
03:10:23,550 --> 03:10:26,010
Oh, that's not good.

4911
03:10:26,590 --> 03:10:28,370
Yeah, this is not good at all.

4912
03:10:31,910 --> 03:10:32,730
It's fine.

4913
03:10:32,890 --> 03:10:33,710
It's not fine.

4914
03:10:34,870 --> 03:10:36,110
It's not fine anymore.

4915
03:10:37,970 --> 03:10:39,390
It's not fine anymore.

4916
03:10:40,090 --> 03:10:41,650
It's not fine anymore.

4917
03:10:42,130 --> 03:10:43,630
It's not fine anymore.

4918
03:10:44,190 --> 03:10:45,530
Kiriko, it's not fine.

4919
03:10:45,690 --> 03:10:46,930
It's not fine at all.

4920
03:10:47,110 --> 03:10:47,330
No!

4921
03:10:47,490 --> 03:10:49,030
Riven, you're the only one left!

4922
03:10:49,070 --> 03:10:50,050
You know, I got a little ambitious.

4923
03:10:52,330 --> 03:10:52,730
No!

4924
03:10:56,700 --> 03:10:57,120
It's okay.

4925
03:10:57,300 --> 03:10:58,180
It'll be different here.

4926
03:11:00,920 --> 03:11:01,660
It'll be different.

4927
03:11:01,780 --> 03:11:02,260
I believe.

4928
03:11:02,900 --> 03:11:04,980
I just realized how big I am on the screen.

4929
03:11:05,100 --> 03:11:07,460
I hope that has not been affecting the gameplay.

4930
03:11:12,820 --> 03:11:17,300
After three hours, I realized, whoa, I'm like one fourth of the screen.

4931
03:11:22,020 --> 03:11:22,720
It's fine.

4932
03:11:22,860 --> 03:11:23,600
Oh, see the bubbles!

4933
03:11:25,700 --> 03:11:27,200
Make it bigger.

4934
03:11:28,480 --> 03:11:29,700
I got you!

4935
03:11:30,820 --> 03:11:31,760
Wait, okay.

4936
03:11:31,900 --> 03:11:32,300
Okay.

4937
03:11:32,380 --> 03:11:32,860
Alright.

4938
03:11:34,200 --> 03:11:34,840
It's fine.

4939
03:11:35,800 --> 03:11:36,560
We're fine.

4940
03:11:36,560 --> 03:11:38,200
Not quite.

4941
03:11:40,300 --> 03:11:42,200
We need it bigger.

4942
03:11:44,720 --> 03:11:46,020
Nice, we did it.

4943
03:11:48,400 --> 03:11:49,160
Woo!

4944
03:11:49,760 --> 03:11:51,300
That was a little ambitious.

4945
03:11:51,960 --> 03:11:55,460
They used EMP, they used Rush, they used Queen ult.

4946
03:11:55,920 --> 03:11:57,340
That was very ambitious.

4947
03:11:57,880 --> 03:12:00,000
No bigger gold.

4948
03:12:00,100 --> 03:12:00,620
No bigger gold.

4949
03:12:00,620 --> 03:12:01,980
I can't see shit.

4950
03:12:02,040 --> 03:12:03,400
Make it bigger.

4951
03:12:08,980 --> 03:12:11,040
Oh, oh, there he is.

4952
03:12:11,220 --> 03:12:12,500
I'm a little scared.

4953
03:12:13,180 --> 03:12:14,840
Just a little scared.

4954
03:12:15,060 --> 03:12:16,720
Just a little bit.

4955
03:12:17,200 --> 03:12:19,140
Just a little bit.

4956
03:12:20,760 --> 03:12:23,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4957
03:12:23,520 --> 03:12:25,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4958
03:12:25,880 --> 03:12:26,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4959
03:12:26,940 --> 03:12:27,860
It's fine.

4960
03:12:28,160 --> 03:12:29,860
It's not fine anymore.

4961
03:12:30,180 --> 03:12:32,300
It is absolutely not fine.

4962
03:12:36,820 --> 03:12:37,500
Fiam.

4963
03:12:38,980 --> 03:12:40,180
Fiam's last words.

4964
03:12:44,140 --> 03:12:44,660
Guys.

4965
03:12:45,060 --> 03:12:47,040
It was nice having a...

4966
03:12:47,040 --> 03:12:48,880
I think it was like...

4967
03:12:48,880 --> 03:12:51,500
It was pretty cool having a positive win rate though.

4968
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:53,380
It was pretty cool.

4969
03:12:55,600 --> 03:12:56,120
I...

4970
03:12:57,480 --> 03:12:58,720
I had a good time.

4971
03:13:00,360 --> 03:13:01,560
Seeing what that was like.

4972
03:13:02,140 --> 03:13:03,240
I had a good time.

4973
03:13:03,240 --> 03:13:03,920
Thank you, thank you.

4974
03:13:04,060 --> 03:13:05,440
Hey Doki, how's it going?

4975
03:13:05,440 --> 03:13:06,660
I ordered Chipotle.

4976
03:13:06,820 --> 03:13:08,600
We were... it was a reversal?

4977
03:13:09,800 --> 03:13:11,780
Are you fucking kidding me?

4978
03:13:12,060 --> 03:13:13,500
That shit was so rough.

4979
03:13:15,080 --> 03:13:17,020
That shit was so fucking rough.

4980
03:13:17,300 --> 03:13:18,900
And it was a fucking reversal.

4981
03:13:19,500 --> 03:13:20,840
That's actually crazy.

4982
03:13:23,080 --> 03:13:24,540
I worked so hard.

4983
03:13:26,040 --> 03:13:28,280
By the way, for those who don't know what reversal means.

4984
03:13:28,760 --> 03:13:30,360
Reversal is basically the...

4985
03:13:30,360 --> 03:13:32,500
Our team was considered...

4986
03:13:33,540 --> 03:13:35,080
Stronger than the enemy team.

4987
03:13:35,160 --> 03:13:35,420
But that's not true.

4988
03:13:35,440 --> 03:13:36,080
There's no way.

4989
03:13:36,240 --> 03:13:37,820
I refuse to believe that.

4990
03:13:38,400 --> 03:13:38,840
Anyway...

4991
03:13:41,240 --> 03:13:41,680
Anyway...

4992
03:13:42,700 --> 03:13:44,260
But yeah, those were my stats.

4993
03:13:44,520 --> 03:13:45,500
It's a little...

4994
03:13:48,480 --> 03:13:49,500
It's not the best.

4995
03:13:54,360 --> 03:13:54,800
Alright,

4996
03:13:58,550 --> 03:13:59,050
here we go.

4997
03:13:59,430 --> 03:14:01,450
It's okay, we win this, we're back to positive.

4998
03:14:03,550 --> 03:14:03,990
Alright.

4999
03:14:05,070 --> 03:14:05,510
Guys.

5000
03:14:06,910 --> 03:14:07,170
I don't know what to do.

5001
03:14:07,530 --> 03:14:08,290
Actually, no.

5002
03:14:09,310 --> 03:14:10,910
Actually, but like, what if?

5003
03:14:12,470 --> 03:14:13,730
But like, what if?

5004
03:14:14,170 --> 03:14:15,930
This is how we break the curse.

5005
03:14:18,790 --> 03:14:22,710
I am bronze player and the gameplay looks the same.

5006
03:14:23,850 --> 03:14:24,970
I am bronze player and the gameplay looks the same.

5007
03:14:24,970 --> 03:14:25,410
Actually, nano blade.

5008
03:14:25,630 --> 03:14:26,530
This is it.

5009
03:14:27,770 --> 03:14:28,630
Nano blade.

5010
03:14:28,950 --> 03:14:30,310
Oh shit!

5011
03:14:30,950 --> 03:14:32,350
This guy doesn't heal.

5012
03:14:32,930 --> 03:14:34,670
This guy is a DPS Lucio.

5013
03:14:34,890 --> 03:14:36,350
This guy...

5014
03:14:38,650 --> 03:14:39,650
This guy...

5015
03:14:39,650 --> 03:14:40,210
Okay.

5016
03:14:40,710 --> 03:14:43,970
I'm gonna be doing all the healing here.

5017
03:14:45,170 --> 03:14:45,710
He keeps me sharp.

5018
03:14:46,850 --> 03:14:48,130
Wait, who said that?

5019
03:14:48,150 --> 03:14:49,150
1000 on Joki losing?

5020
03:14:49,610 --> 03:14:51,010
Okay, Brados McGee!

5021
03:14:51,490 --> 03:14:52,710
I'm gonna remember you.

5022
03:14:53,810 --> 03:14:55,910
I'm gonna fucking call you out if we win this.

5023
03:14:56,150 --> 03:14:58,770
Why do I have this individual on my team?

5024
03:14:58,850 --> 03:15:00,390
What did I do to hurt God?

5025
03:15:00,390 --> 03:15:01,670
I'll just tell you.

5026
03:15:01,730 --> 03:15:03,930
This Lucio is a DPS Lucio.

5027
03:15:04,630 --> 03:15:07,070
So, I'm gonna be doing all the healing soon.

5028
03:15:08,830 --> 03:15:09,510
I'm gonna be doing all the healing soon.

5029
03:15:10,230 --> 03:15:11,170
Here we go.

5030
03:15:13,750 --> 03:15:14,230
Alright.

5031
03:15:14,930 --> 03:15:15,930
I have a ram.

5032
03:15:16,130 --> 03:15:16,650
Watch this.

5033
03:15:16,830 --> 03:15:17,370
I'm watching.

5034
03:15:20,610 --> 03:15:21,770
Oh, he's on time!

5035
03:15:21,890 --> 03:15:22,210
He's on time!

5036
03:15:22,950 --> 03:15:23,390
What?

5037
03:15:26,570 --> 03:15:28,010
There's no way he...

5038
03:15:28,010 --> 03:15:28,990
Okay, I was gonna say.

5039
03:15:29,130 --> 03:15:30,330
I'm gonna install this game right now.

5040
03:15:30,390 --> 03:15:32,510
I have to fix my frames.

5041
03:15:33,470 --> 03:15:33,890
What?

5042
03:15:34,510 --> 03:15:35,350
What frames?

5043
03:15:35,350 --> 03:15:36,110
You're on Lucio.

5044
03:15:36,190 --> 03:15:38,090
People who have no frames will play Lucio.

5045
03:15:38,810 --> 03:15:39,430
Hold on.

5046
03:15:39,450 --> 03:15:40,410
You wanna see something crazy?

5047
03:15:41,010 --> 03:15:41,370
What?

5048
03:15:42,310 --> 03:15:42,950
Watch this.

5049
03:15:46,390 --> 03:15:47,230
I'm gonna...

5050
03:15:48,550 --> 03:15:49,390
I'm gonna...

5051
03:15:50,850 --> 03:15:51,390
I'm tied?

5052
03:15:51,770 --> 03:15:53,570
You're gonna jump off the bridge in the altar, right?

5053
03:15:54,310 --> 03:15:55,230
No, I'm gonna make...

5054
03:15:55,230 --> 03:15:56,230
Oh my God.

5055
03:15:56,250 --> 03:15:57,630
Wait, wait, wait.

5056
03:16:00,630 --> 03:16:01,210
Okay.

5057
03:16:01,610 --> 03:16:02,690
I have to reload.

5058
03:16:02,830 --> 03:16:03,510
I have to reload.

5059
03:16:03,810 --> 03:16:04,150
Okay.

5060
03:16:04,570 --> 03:16:05,950
I have to reload.

5061
03:16:06,210 --> 03:16:06,910
Let's go.

5062
03:16:08,970 --> 03:16:10,650
No, actually watch this.

5063
03:16:10,690 --> 03:16:11,150
Come over here.

5064
03:16:11,530 --> 03:16:12,110
No!

5065
03:16:14,630 --> 03:16:15,210
No!

5066
03:16:15,310 --> 03:16:16,970
Stop doing streamer things!

5067
03:16:20,370 --> 03:16:20,950
Stop!

5068
03:16:23,610 --> 03:16:26,830
Stop doing streamer things with the game!

5069
03:16:32,630 --> 03:16:33,810
Play to win!

5070
03:16:34,410 --> 03:16:36,510
Don't play for streamer moments!

5071
03:16:38,150 --> 03:16:39,430
Don't play for streamer moments!

5072
03:16:41,010 --> 03:16:42,810
That's all I asked for!

5073
03:16:43,430 --> 03:16:43,550
That's all I asked for!

5074
03:16:43,550 --> 03:16:43,770
That's all I asked for!

5075
03:16:43,770 --> 03:16:45,830
We don't need streamer mo...

5076
03:16:45,830 --> 03:16:47,330
We don't need streamer mo... cool streamer clips!

5077
03:16:47,730 --> 03:16:49,650
But the content...

5078
03:16:49,650 --> 03:16:51,270
The content is winning!

5079
03:16:53,390 --> 03:16:56,130
I try to play the best I can!

5080
03:16:56,550 --> 03:16:58,210
And I still make content.

5081
03:16:58,210 --> 03:17:01,270
That's just a fucking content diff right there.

5082
03:17:01,390 --> 03:17:03,350
And I still make content.

5083
03:17:03,590 --> 03:17:05,670
I'm not saying content diff.

5084
03:17:06,090 --> 03:17:06,390
I'm not saying content diff.

5085
03:17:06,390 --> 03:17:08,350
But... content diff.

5086
03:17:08,850 --> 03:17:09,590
No, you're new.

5087
03:17:11,070 --> 03:17:13,970
Let's put like 400 alts right now.

5088
03:17:14,470 --> 03:17:15,870
Oh my God!

5089
03:17:16,050 --> 03:17:16,750
The 2k!

5090
03:17:17,970 --> 03:17:19,390
We definitely do not.

5091
03:17:19,650 --> 03:17:20,710
Is the Bob there?

5092
03:17:21,590 --> 03:17:23,010
Is the Bob still there?

5093
03:17:23,250 --> 03:17:24,210
Oh my God.

5094
03:17:24,210 --> 03:17:24,690
Oh my God.

5095
03:17:25,890 --> 03:17:26,490
Nice.

5096
03:17:29,230 --> 03:17:30,910
Now you do what?

5097
03:17:30,910 --> 03:17:31,050
Now you do what?

5098
03:17:31,310 --> 03:17:31,850
This?

5099
03:17:31,850 --> 03:17:31,910
What?

5100
03:17:32,310 --> 03:17:35,830
But my hog is just so terrible.

5101
03:17:35,890 --> 03:17:36,490
We're good.

5102
03:17:36,750 --> 03:17:39,030
One continent let's show care.

5103
03:17:39,170 --> 03:17:39,970
Like a neon hog.

5104
03:17:40,070 --> 03:17:41,370
Literally neon hog.

5105
03:17:42,310 --> 03:17:43,190
Oh no.

5106
03:17:43,310 --> 03:17:44,230
They're making content.

5107
03:17:44,330 --> 03:17:45,590
They're trying to make content again.

5108
03:17:45,770 --> 03:17:47,770
They're trying to make content again!

5109
03:17:48,330 --> 03:17:49,730
I'm pushing the ash, bro.

5110
03:17:50,710 --> 03:17:51,910
You're inting!

5111
03:17:52,210 --> 03:17:52,810
No!

5112
03:17:54,450 --> 03:17:55,530
How does...

5113
03:17:56,010 --> 03:17:57,950
What the fuck?

5114
03:17:58,710 --> 03:18:00,190
Bro, he got outjunked!

5115
03:18:00,190 --> 03:18:01,030
Watch this.

5116
03:18:01,250 --> 03:18:03,410
He got outjunked so hard!

5117
03:18:03,970 --> 03:18:04,370
Keep watching.

5118
03:18:06,630 --> 03:18:07,550
I made space.

5119
03:18:07,850 --> 03:18:09,090
Guys, one day.

5120
03:18:09,650 --> 03:18:10,450
One day.

5121
03:18:10,910 --> 03:18:14,210
Bring me back to days when making content was winning the game.

5122
03:18:18,650 --> 03:18:21,090
Bring me back to the good old days.

5123
03:18:21,310 --> 03:18:21,610
Bring me back to the good old days.

5124
03:18:22,750 --> 03:18:23,310
Overwhelming.

5125
03:18:24,210 --> 03:18:24,430
Not true.

5126
03:18:25,410 --> 03:18:27,830
It's like years of zombies.

5127
03:18:27,910 --> 03:18:29,150
Literally you and he, right?

5128
03:18:29,970 --> 03:18:31,270
Please don't let me die.

5129
03:18:31,310 --> 03:18:32,790
I'm your only hope, Gengu.

5130
03:18:33,690 --> 03:18:34,390
Gengu, please.

5131
03:18:35,370 --> 03:18:36,130
Gengu, please.

5132
03:18:36,970 --> 03:18:37,410
Gengu.

5133
03:18:39,430 --> 03:18:40,110
Come on.

5134
03:18:40,610 --> 03:18:42,810
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

5135
03:18:44,890 --> 03:18:47,330
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

5136
03:18:48,090 --> 03:18:51,290
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

5137
03:18:51,290 --> 03:18:51,670
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

5138
03:18:51,670 --> 03:18:52,010
Please.

5139
03:18:52,290 --> 03:18:52,770
Please.

5140
03:18:52,830 --> 03:18:54,730
Our Gengu died with a nano blade.

5141
03:18:55,310 --> 03:18:56,430
Our Gengu died.

5142
03:18:56,630 --> 03:18:58,210
Our Lucio died with a Lucio.

5143
03:19:00,450 --> 03:19:02,050
Our Hog's gonna die too.

5144
03:19:02,390 --> 03:19:02,630
Our Hog's gonna die too.

5145
03:19:02,850 --> 03:19:03,230
Our Hog's gonna die too.

5146
03:19:05,330 --> 03:19:05,810
Alright.

5147
03:19:07,530 --> 03:19:08,010
Alright.

5148
03:19:08,570 --> 03:19:09,650
Alright, here we go.

5149
03:19:10,390 --> 03:19:11,390
Here we not go.

5150
03:19:12,050 --> 03:19:12,530
Alright.

5151
03:19:13,230 --> 03:19:14,330
I think it's time.

5152
03:19:15,550 --> 03:19:16,650
No, I don't think so.

5153
03:19:18,850 --> 03:19:21,350
It's all about the epic fail.

5154
03:19:21,350 --> 03:19:21,650
It's all about the epic fail.

5155
03:19:22,810 --> 03:19:24,810
When you close your ears.

5156
03:19:24,810 --> 03:19:24,970
When you close your ears.

5157
03:19:25,550 --> 03:19:27,890
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da.

5158
03:19:27,890 --> 03:19:30,130
Ba-ba-ba-da-da-da.

5159
03:19:30,430 --> 03:19:31,070
Yay.

5160
03:19:33,010 --> 03:19:40,330
To be fair though, if you're streaming this game non-stop, you have to figure out some ways to make this engaging.

5161
03:19:40,650 --> 03:19:41,190
to make this engaging.

5162
03:19:43,390 --> 03:19:46,410
But then, to be fair, people watch Shroud.

5163
03:19:47,550 --> 03:19:50,330
There's an audience for people who just wanna watch winners.

5164
03:19:50,430 --> 03:19:50,790
I'm dead.

5165
03:19:53,490 --> 03:19:55,530
How did he find me?

5166
03:19:56,050 --> 03:19:58,690
How did he find me?

5167
03:19:58,690 --> 03:19:58,730
Oh.

5168
03:19:58,930 --> 03:19:59,490
Okay.

5169
03:19:59,810 --> 03:20:00,950
I saw that.

5170
03:20:01,210 --> 03:20:02,130
I was like, how did he know?

5171
03:20:06,030 --> 03:20:06,590
Okay.

5172
03:20:08,370 --> 03:20:11,930
There's still an audience for people who wanna watch people win games.

5173
03:20:12,290 --> 03:20:13,290
Look at Shroud.

5174
03:20:15,110 --> 03:20:18,530
His personality is literally winning video games.

5175
03:20:18,790 --> 03:20:20,330
And being good at video games.

5176
03:20:20,470 --> 03:20:21,030
And being good at video games.

5177
03:20:21,670 --> 03:20:23,170
Oh, I almost got the ram.

5178
03:20:23,430 --> 03:20:24,810
What Shroud?

5179
03:20:25,470 --> 03:20:26,630
He's a...

5180
03:20:26,630 --> 03:20:31,490
He's a boomer that is good at any FPS game he touches.

5181
03:20:32,170 --> 03:20:34,070
And TPS game as well.

5182
03:20:38,730 --> 03:20:40,230
He's also a millionaire.

5183
03:20:42,410 --> 03:20:43,710
I hear you.

5184
03:20:44,430 --> 03:20:45,610
From Matra.

5185
03:20:45,690 --> 03:20:46,270
Okay, I gotta go.

5186
03:20:48,450 --> 03:20:49,750
Am I gonna die?

5187
03:20:52,230 --> 03:20:53,290
I'm dead to this.

5188
03:20:53,850 --> 03:20:54,830
I'm dead to this.

5189
03:20:54,910 --> 03:20:56,070
I'm not dead to this.

5190
03:20:57,370 --> 03:20:58,470
I'm not dead to this.

5191
03:20:58,470 --> 03:20:58,910
I'm not dead to this.

5192
03:20:59,970 --> 03:21:00,730
We're fine.

5193
03:21:00,890 --> 03:21:01,470
We're fine.

5194
03:21:02,770 --> 03:21:04,330
We can do this.

5195
03:21:04,330 --> 03:21:05,030
I have ult.

5196
03:21:06,190 --> 03:21:08,230
Which if he comes to win.

5197
03:21:09,870 --> 03:21:10,350
Okay.

5198
03:21:12,270 --> 03:21:12,750
Alright.

5199
03:21:12,750 --> 03:21:13,230
Here you go.

5200
03:21:14,090 --> 03:21:15,170
It'll be fine.

5201
03:21:15,310 --> 03:21:17,270
We might have the Junkrat.

5202
03:21:17,270 --> 03:21:18,390
But we'll be fine.

5203
03:21:19,970 --> 03:21:20,510
Okay.

5204
03:21:20,610 --> 03:21:21,110
I'm watching.

5205
03:21:21,350 --> 03:21:22,190
I'm watch... OOOH!

5206
03:21:22,190 --> 03:21:22,950
That's actually good!

5207
03:21:23,110 --> 03:21:24,350
That's actually a good bomb!

5208
03:21:25,670 --> 03:21:26,370
There you go.

5209
03:21:28,110 --> 03:21:29,490
We're doing it.

5210
03:21:30,690 --> 03:21:32,070
Is Doki winning?

5211
03:21:32,530 --> 03:21:33,230
Define winning.

5212
03:21:33,910 --> 03:21:37,030
Being even in my win rate percentage right now for today.

5213
03:21:37,770 --> 03:21:38,310
Even...

5214
03:21:41,550 --> 03:21:43,530
After 3 and a half hours.

5215
03:21:45,230 --> 03:21:46,090
He'll be fine.

5216
03:21:47,270 --> 03:21:50,290
I don't think he'll remember the one time you spawn camped me.

5217
03:21:50,510 --> 03:21:51,730
4 years ago.

5218
03:21:52,870 --> 03:21:53,390
Okay.

5219
03:21:53,530 --> 03:21:54,310
To be fair...

5220
03:21:54,310 --> 03:21:56,430
Any good gaming moment, I remember.

5221
03:21:56,950 --> 03:21:57,250
Wow!

5222
03:21:58,850 --> 03:21:59,630
Can't die.

5223
03:22:01,430 --> 03:22:03,210
Why am I flying into them?

5224
03:22:03,410 --> 03:22:05,830
I only remember that because I was looking through old screenshots on my PC.

5225
03:22:07,050 --> 03:22:07,570
Ohhh...

5226
03:22:09,990 --> 03:22:10,510
Ohhh...

5227
03:22:10,510 --> 03:22:12,670
You're so proud of spawn camping me?

5228
03:22:12,730 --> 03:22:13,270
I wish!

5229
03:22:13,370 --> 03:22:15,410
Three years ago I was playing Ana!

5230
03:22:17,270 --> 03:22:17,690
What's going on?

5231
03:22:19,090 --> 03:22:26,590
I wish I kept my old... I wish sometimes I kept my old videos and old clips.

5232
03:22:26,810 --> 03:22:32,130
Because I had a moment where I spawn camped... not spawn camped, but like I...

5233
03:22:33,870 --> 03:22:40,730
I caused him, the tatman, to like rage so hard in the game that like he... he like...

5234
03:22:41,250 --> 03:22:43,490
He like rage quit overwatch.

5235
03:22:49,170 --> 03:22:49,970
Oh no...

5236
03:22:49,970 --> 03:22:51,270
Oh no...

5237
03:22:51,950 --> 03:22:53,790
No, I didn't keep any of it.

5238
03:22:53,790 --> 03:22:55,690
It was like on my old old PC.

5239
03:22:56,070 --> 03:22:58,330
I didn't keep any of it because I never, you know...

5240
03:22:59,030 --> 03:23:01,730
I never thought I would have to look back at it again.

5241
03:23:03,790 --> 03:23:05,170
Oh, he's so dead.

5242
03:23:05,790 --> 03:23:07,270
You know, it was a good push.

5243
03:23:08,690 --> 03:23:09,950
It was not winnable.

5244
03:23:15,270 --> 03:23:16,570
The good old days.

5245
03:23:17,270 --> 03:23:26,330
I used to have clips of like moments where like I have like big streamers rage at me because I was... I used to be good.

5246
03:23:26,510 --> 03:23:26,990
I...

5247
03:23:29,630 --> 03:23:34,330
It was like Tim, the tatman, Moonmoon and...

5248
03:23:34,330 --> 03:23:35,350
Who is it?

5249
03:23:35,530 --> 03:23:39,030
It was like Tim, Moonmoon and one... a DPS player.

5250
03:23:39,270 --> 03:23:40,050
I don't remember who.

5251
03:23:40,410 --> 03:23:42,310
I wish I had the clips though.

5252
03:23:43,470 --> 03:23:45,130
I wish I had the clips.

5253
03:23:45,130 --> 03:23:46,090
I wish I had the clips.

5254
03:23:46,090 --> 03:23:47,550
Always play Ramatra, right?

5255
03:23:47,730 --> 03:23:48,750
Okay Zenyatta time.

5256
03:23:49,050 --> 03:23:50,370
All that lost content.

5257
03:23:50,630 --> 03:23:50,910
Yeah.

5258
03:23:51,110 --> 03:23:56,590
If I still had my tweets from like before a time, I would have...

5259
03:23:56,590 --> 03:23:56,930
What do you mean?

5260
03:23:56,970 --> 03:23:59,730
If I still have the clips, we would...

5261
03:23:59,730 --> 03:24:00,450
Lucio is such a good hero.

5262
03:24:01,710 --> 03:24:04,770
Or tweets from back then, then we could have it.

5263
03:24:04,810 --> 03:24:04,910
That's just not true.

5264
03:24:05,090 --> 03:24:05,550
He's my...

5265
03:24:05,550 --> 03:24:06,530
The lost media.

5266
03:24:07,550 --> 03:24:08,930
Was a stream sniper?

5267
03:24:09,050 --> 03:24:10,330
I wasn't a stream sniper.

5268
03:24:10,510 --> 03:24:14,690
It's just I... He would have been high elo games and they were in high elo games.

5269
03:24:15,670 --> 03:24:18,470
I'm saying go through my profile and look my winrate on every other character.

5270
03:24:19,610 --> 03:24:22,430
Yeah, I made Tim, the tatman rage quit Overwatch.

5271
03:24:23,370 --> 03:24:27,430
You like literally got off Overwatch and like quit the game because of me.

5272
03:24:29,390 --> 03:24:31,890
He even like solo shattered me too.

5273
03:24:32,090 --> 03:24:33,610
I was like fuck this Lucio.

5274
03:24:36,170 --> 03:24:40,190
Alright buddy, I'm gonna sit here and wipe my mouse down while you... yeah.

5275
03:24:42,750 --> 03:24:44,210
Tim, what are those names?

5276
03:24:44,410 --> 03:24:45,110
He... Tim, the tatman.

5277
03:24:45,110 --> 03:24:47,090
The tatman used to be like one of these streamers.

5278
03:24:48,110 --> 03:24:49,210
Umm... on Twitch.

5279
03:24:52,130 --> 03:24:54,970
And now MooMoo is just a GTA RP streamer.

5280
03:24:55,330 --> 03:24:56,290
Oh, I should go hog.

5281
03:24:58,390 --> 03:24:59,170
Let's see.

5282
03:24:59,530 --> 03:25:01,630
You know they say like the camera adds 10 pounds?

5283
03:25:01,750 --> 03:25:03,150
I think picking hog adds like 40.

5284
03:25:03,930 --> 03:25:04,970
Oh fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

5285
03:25:06,270 --> 03:25:07,370
I discredited him.

5286
03:25:07,810 --> 03:25:09,250
I think he wants to punch me now.

5287
03:25:10,170 --> 03:25:11,890
I personally think Doomfist dies.

5288
03:25:12,230 --> 03:25:12,670
Oh!

5289
03:25:15,250 --> 03:25:16,230
Oh my god.

5290
03:25:16,270 --> 03:25:16,650
Wooo!

5291
03:25:18,450 --> 03:25:19,430
I did that.

5292
03:25:20,610 --> 03:25:21,810
I did that smile.

5293
03:25:22,150 --> 03:25:23,430
Oh, I gave him punch.

5294
03:25:24,170 --> 03:25:25,410
I gave him punch.

5295
03:25:25,590 --> 03:25:25,870
Whoops.

5296
03:25:29,970 --> 03:25:30,990
Oh... did I?

5297
03:25:31,650 --> 03:25:33,050
Okay, please get your mech.

5298
03:25:33,150 --> 03:25:34,210
Please get your mech.

5299
03:25:34,450 --> 03:25:35,410
That's all I want.

5300
03:25:37,050 --> 03:25:37,510
Oh!

5301
03:25:37,650 --> 03:25:38,730
I didn't give him punch this time.

5302
03:25:39,170 --> 03:25:40,410
I didn't commit a mistake.

5303
03:25:41,890 --> 03:25:42,350
Oh.

5304
03:25:42,470 --> 03:25:42,650
Oh.

5305
03:25:42,670 --> 03:25:43,450
I squished him.

5306
03:25:43,450 --> 03:25:44,610
I squished him.

5307
03:25:44,910 --> 03:25:46,230
No, no you didn't.

5308
03:25:46,230 --> 03:25:46,910
Please, please.

5309
03:25:47,850 --> 03:25:48,690
Don't die.

5310
03:25:49,930 --> 03:25:50,690
You're welcome.

5311
03:25:50,930 --> 03:25:52,690
Okay, buddy.

5312
03:25:53,010 --> 03:25:55,350
Guys, we need assistance.

5313
03:25:55,890 --> 03:25:57,030
I'm just like a human crit hit.

5314
03:25:57,450 --> 03:25:59,150
Just kill one person.

5315
03:25:59,230 --> 03:26:00,210
That's all I care about.

5316
03:26:00,490 --> 03:26:01,770
Say your human is pushing it.

5317
03:26:02,590 --> 03:26:02,830
Hahaha!

5318
03:26:03,730 --> 03:26:04,670
Thank you.

5319
03:26:04,810 --> 03:26:05,990
I'll take it as a compliment.

5320
03:26:06,570 --> 03:26:07,130
Oh.

5321
03:26:08,650 --> 03:26:09,210
Guys.

5322
03:26:09,530 --> 03:26:11,150
Kill anything.

5323
03:26:12,670 --> 03:26:13,930
I'll take any kills.

5324
03:26:15,390 --> 03:26:16,230
Kill anybody.

5325
03:26:16,670 --> 03:26:16,950
Wait.

5326
03:26:16,990 --> 03:26:17,410
Wait.

5327
03:26:19,890 --> 03:26:20,570
Nice, nice.

5328
03:26:20,610 --> 03:26:21,090
That's a good wall.

5329
03:26:21,990 --> 03:26:23,270
We got the bombs.

5330
03:26:23,410 --> 03:26:26,270
Put my bomb in front of the enemy team's window.

5331
03:26:26,510 --> 03:26:29,690
I have to save my trans for the male.

5332
03:26:30,210 --> 03:26:31,230
What rank is this?

5333
03:26:32,390 --> 03:26:34,110
D1 to Master's III.

5334
03:26:34,530 --> 03:26:34,950
Is the rank.

5335
03:26:36,750 --> 03:26:37,170
Guys.

5336
03:26:37,370 --> 03:26:37,770
Guys.

5337
03:26:37,850 --> 03:26:38,270
Guys.

5338
03:26:38,290 --> 03:26:38,510
Please.

5339
03:26:39,210 --> 03:26:40,590
Guys, if I die, we lose.

5340
03:26:41,130 --> 03:26:42,410
If I die, we lose.

5341
03:26:43,190 --> 03:26:47,430
If I die, we lose.

5342
03:26:48,610 --> 03:26:49,090
Alright.

5343
03:26:50,650 --> 03:26:51,130
Nice.

5344
03:26:53,430 --> 03:26:54,210
Squirted Mora.

5345
03:26:54,490 --> 03:26:55,290
I'm killing Light Weaver.

5346
03:26:56,410 --> 03:26:56,890
Hit.

5347
03:26:56,890 --> 03:26:57,170
Hit.

5348
03:26:57,230 --> 03:26:57,530
Hit.

5349
03:26:58,110 --> 03:26:59,570
Oh god, not hit anymore.

5350
03:26:59,810 --> 03:27:00,290
Nooooo!

5351
03:27:01,430 --> 03:27:01,910
No!

5352
03:27:02,110 --> 03:27:02,590
Please!

5353
03:27:02,670 --> 03:27:03,550
Please kill them!

5354
03:27:04,270 --> 03:27:05,790
Please, just kill the Doom!

5355
03:27:06,430 --> 03:27:08,350
Why is this guy still spying?

5356
03:27:08,510 --> 03:27:09,110
What are you doing?

5357
03:27:10,070 --> 03:27:11,330
Please, just hit the Doom.

5358
03:27:16,310 --> 03:27:17,370
There you go.

5359
03:27:17,370 --> 03:27:17,750
We're fine.

5360
03:27:18,190 --> 03:27:18,710
We're fine.

5361
03:27:21,790 --> 03:27:22,410
It's okay.

5362
03:27:25,810 --> 03:27:26,410
It's okay.

5363
03:27:26,490 --> 03:27:29,550
We still have our... We still have transfer mail.

5364
03:27:30,450 --> 03:27:31,070
We're fine.

5365
03:27:31,890 --> 03:27:34,670
This is where I might die though because the Doom is looking at me.

5366
03:27:35,630 --> 03:27:39,190
Oh, I do not like where I'm positioned right now.

5367
03:27:41,830 --> 03:27:43,970
Wait, he's... What?

5368
03:27:44,510 --> 03:27:46,170
Where is this?

5369
03:27:46,410 --> 03:27:47,330
It's okay.

5370
03:27:49,270 --> 03:27:50,790
It's okay, Ruben!

5371
03:27:51,390 --> 03:27:55,470
It's not okay because I'm so on this position now!

5372
03:27:57,030 --> 03:27:57,710
This is fine.

5373
03:27:58,070 --> 03:28:05,030
I sacrificed my life for the position for that.

5374
03:28:06,110 --> 03:28:08,010
It was actually not okay.

5375
03:28:08,250 --> 03:28:10,890
It was actually not okay.

5376
03:28:14,670 --> 03:28:15,190
Ow.

5377
03:28:15,670 --> 03:28:16,870
No, Ruben.

5378
03:28:16,930 --> 03:28:19,470
If you DM the Venture, I would only lose.

5379
03:28:19,910 --> 03:28:20,430
Oh.

5380
03:28:20,710 --> 03:28:21,750
There you go.

5381
03:28:22,010 --> 03:28:23,510
The Venture would have died.

5382
03:28:24,030 --> 03:28:24,550
Please!

5383
03:28:24,810 --> 03:28:25,230
Nice!

5384
03:28:25,570 --> 03:28:26,330
We're fine.

5385
03:28:28,010 --> 03:28:28,890
Wait, what?

5386
03:28:28,990 --> 03:28:29,610
We're not fine.

5387
03:28:29,850 --> 03:28:30,890
There's an Adventure up there.

5388
03:28:32,230 --> 03:28:35,710
I was walled and I got full Venture combo and I had no answer.

5389
03:28:35,810 --> 03:28:36,210
It's okay.

5390
03:28:36,490 --> 03:28:37,450
Capstir lives those.

5391
03:28:38,250 --> 03:28:39,810
The Mei also missed her...

5392
03:28:39,810 --> 03:28:40,070
I know.

5393
03:28:40,090 --> 03:28:44,570
I saved that chance for 20 years just for the Mei to fuck up her ult.

5394
03:28:44,850 --> 03:28:45,010
What?

5395
03:28:45,490 --> 03:28:46,850
No way I don't pick this.

5396
03:28:47,070 --> 03:28:48,010
There's no way.

5397
03:28:48,130 --> 03:28:49,670
Somebody break the thing!

5398
03:28:50,210 --> 03:28:51,770
Oh, my God.

5399
03:28:52,290 --> 03:28:55,650
Oh, my God.

5400
03:28:56,070 --> 03:28:56,670
Okay.

5401
03:28:58,370 --> 03:28:59,150
Thank you.

5402
03:28:59,210 --> 03:29:01,810
I don't know what that guy is doing, but...

5403
03:29:02,670 --> 03:29:02,990
I...

5404
03:29:02,990 --> 03:29:04,670
Merry-go-round.

5405
03:29:04,870 --> 03:29:06,390
Merry-go-round.

5406
03:29:06,650 --> 03:29:07,250
Merry...

5407
03:29:07,810 --> 03:29:08,990
What the fuck?

5408
03:29:09,810 --> 03:29:10,130
I'm just trying to...

5409
03:29:13,290 --> 03:29:13,850
Okay.

5410
03:29:14,370 --> 03:29:14,930
Goodbye.

5411
03:29:17,750 --> 03:29:18,310
Goodbye.

5412
03:29:23,910 --> 03:29:25,030
Holy shit.

5413
03:29:25,550 --> 03:29:26,330
It's fine.

5414
03:29:26,490 --> 03:29:27,610
Everything is fine.

5415
03:29:27,730 --> 03:29:28,430
We can touch.

5416
03:29:28,710 --> 03:29:28,850
I will touch.

5417
03:29:29,050 --> 03:29:29,310
I will touch.

5418
03:29:32,090 --> 03:29:33,670
I didn't play Brig.

5419
03:29:33,810 --> 03:29:34,530
Why Brig?

5420
03:29:37,250 --> 03:29:37,810
No!

5421
03:29:37,970 --> 03:29:38,890
Not the Mei!

5422
03:29:38,990 --> 03:29:39,310
Wow!

5423
03:29:41,110 --> 03:29:42,370
I guess I'll die here.

5424
03:29:42,370 --> 03:29:44,150
I guess I'll die here.

5425
03:29:44,250 --> 03:29:44,490
I guess I'll die here.

5426
03:29:44,490 --> 03:29:44,870
I guess I'll die here.

5427
03:29:44,870 --> 03:29:45,310
Dipstick.

5428
03:29:45,590 --> 03:29:46,150
Dipstick.

5429
03:29:48,490 --> 03:29:49,050
Okay.

5430
03:29:49,050 --> 03:29:51,910
To be fair, we do have a Junk player.

5431
03:29:52,110 --> 03:29:53,630
To be fair, guys.

5432
03:29:54,170 --> 03:29:56,610
We have a Junk player.

5433
03:30:01,630 --> 03:30:02,990
Oh, my God.

5434
03:30:03,030 --> 03:30:03,950
Someone, please!

5435
03:30:04,610 --> 03:30:05,630
Break the wall!

5436
03:30:05,830 --> 03:30:06,750
I can't hear!

5437
03:30:11,400 --> 03:30:12,180
Oh, no.

5438
03:30:12,260 --> 03:30:12,720
Oh, no.

5439
03:30:14,660 --> 03:30:16,160
Oh no.

5440
03:30:16,560 --> 03:30:19,560
Oh no.

5441
03:30:20,680 --> 03:30:21,160
Oh no.

5442
03:30:21,160 --> 03:30:22,130
Oh no.

5443
03:30:24,400 --> 03:30:25,720
He's so low!

5444
03:30:25,820 --> 03:30:26,320
Burn him!

5445
03:30:27,020 --> 03:30:27,920
Just kill him!

5446
03:30:28,260 --> 03:30:31,020
What the fuck is this wall?!

5447
03:30:31,430 --> 03:30:31,920
Okay.

5448
03:30:32,160 --> 03:30:33,760
I'm actually mad.

5449
03:30:33,760 --> 03:30:35,040
We don't need to overchase.

5450
03:30:35,080 --> 03:30:36,020
They should be close to us.

5451
03:30:36,060 --> 03:30:36,920
Be careful.

5452
03:30:38,740 --> 03:30:39,600
I'm almost at rally.

5453
03:30:39,740 --> 03:30:39,940
I'm almost at rally.

5454
03:30:41,580 --> 03:30:42,560
I slept somebody.

5455
03:30:43,660 --> 03:30:45,840
Bro, that fucking...

5456
03:30:45,840 --> 03:30:46,400
Push the meter.

5457
03:30:46,500 --> 03:30:47,040
Push the meter.

5458
03:30:49,480 --> 03:30:51,220
I need care.

5459
03:30:51,300 --> 03:30:51,400
I need care.

5460
03:30:51,720 --> 03:30:52,540
I'm almost at rally.

5461
03:30:52,660 --> 03:30:52,960
I have rally.

5462
03:30:52,960 --> 03:30:53,860
I have rally and one more stun.

5463
03:30:53,900 --> 03:30:55,120
Oh my god.

5464
03:30:55,440 --> 03:30:56,140
I'm shooting the wall.

5465
03:30:56,200 --> 03:30:56,360
I'm coming.

5466
03:30:56,500 --> 03:30:56,940
I'm under Mei.

5467
03:30:56,980 --> 03:30:57,380
I'm under Mei.

5468
03:30:58,520 --> 03:30:58,840
Okay.

5469
03:30:59,600 --> 03:31:00,040
I have to reload.

5470
03:31:00,220 --> 03:31:00,680
I have to reload.

5471
03:31:00,780 --> 03:31:01,240
I have to reload.

5472
03:31:01,580 --> 03:31:02,900
We gotta kill Mei after I...

5473
03:31:03,760 --> 03:31:03,940
No!

5474
03:31:04,260 --> 03:31:04,600
Mei low.

5475
03:31:04,740 --> 03:31:05,180
Mei low.

5476
03:31:05,300 --> 03:31:05,440
Mei low.

5477
03:31:05,600 --> 03:31:05,940
Mei one.

5478
03:31:06,240 --> 03:31:06,440
Mei one.

5479
03:31:06,460 --> 03:31:06,620
Mei one.

5480
03:31:06,800 --> 03:31:07,760
Mei one.

5481
03:31:11,340 --> 03:31:12,460
The tire clutch!

5482
03:31:13,020 --> 03:31:14,640
They have Mei ult though.

5483
03:31:15,120 --> 03:31:16,520
They have Mei ult.

5484
03:31:18,360 --> 03:31:18,740
Okay.

5485
03:31:18,800 --> 03:31:19,020
Big.

5486
03:31:19,660 --> 03:31:20,720
Oh my god.

5487
03:31:21,900 --> 03:31:23,440
We only have... We only have tectonic.

5488
03:31:23,520 --> 03:31:24,120
What do they use?

5489
03:31:24,200 --> 03:31:24,380
What?

5490
03:31:24,880 --> 03:31:25,260
Meteor?

5491
03:31:25,260 --> 03:31:26,240
They have Mei ult.

5492
03:31:29,560 --> 03:31:30,760
We just have tectonic.

5493
03:31:30,900 --> 03:31:31,420
We need to...

5494
03:31:32,500 --> 03:31:38,880
We need to try and like farm nano here and like maybe use tectonic for... so we can build a farm.

5495
03:31:38,920 --> 03:31:39,060
Bro.

5496
03:31:39,700 --> 03:31:42,140
I'm so... I'm dead.

5497
03:31:42,260 --> 03:31:43,000
I'm so dead.

5498
03:31:43,100 --> 03:31:43,840
I'm so dead.

5499
03:31:44,680 --> 03:31:46,840
I'm on Mei 24-5.

5500
03:31:47,020 --> 03:31:47,420
Nice.

5501
03:31:47,620 --> 03:31:48,040
What are you doing?

5502
03:31:48,340 --> 03:31:49,000
What are you doing?

5503
03:31:50,600 --> 03:31:51,100
Brick tree.

5504
03:31:51,220 --> 03:31:51,480
Brick tree.

5505
03:31:51,920 --> 03:31:52,440
It's tectonic.

5506
03:31:52,540 --> 03:31:53,020
Carrier Avenger.

5507
03:31:53,080 --> 03:31:53,400
Carrier Avenger.

5508
03:31:53,440 --> 03:31:53,920
Flicker Avenger ult.

5509
03:31:53,980 --> 03:31:54,340
Flicker Avenger ult.

5510
03:31:55,080 --> 03:31:55,480
Marnialfame.

5511
03:31:55,540 --> 03:31:55,760
Marnialfame.

5512
03:31:55,860 --> 03:31:56,060
Marnialfame.

5513
03:31:56,140 --> 03:31:56,460
Marnialfame.

5514
03:31:57,400 --> 03:31:57,800
No!

5515
03:31:58,160 --> 03:31:59,460
I can't do anything!

5516
03:31:59,460 --> 03:32:01,300
The Avenger is behind us!

5517
03:32:01,900 --> 03:32:02,160
Please!

5518
03:32:04,380 --> 03:32:05,100
No!

5519
03:32:05,360 --> 03:32:07,940
The fucking Avenger flake!

5520
03:32:09,000 --> 03:32:11,180
The Avenger flake!

5521
03:32:11,600 --> 03:32:12,280
We almost have nano.

5522
03:32:12,340 --> 03:32:13,440
3% off if you can live.

5523
03:32:13,560 --> 03:32:13,940
No!

5524
03:32:14,180 --> 03:32:16,140
The Avenger flake!

5525
03:32:16,540 --> 03:32:17,080
Bro!

5526
03:32:17,340 --> 03:32:18,480
Where the fuck?

5527
03:32:18,620 --> 03:32:20,920
Nobody fucking helped me!

5528
03:32:23,220 --> 03:32:26,660
No one helped me for the Avenger flake!

5529
03:32:29,460 --> 03:32:31,620
He said focus Avenger!

5530
03:32:31,880 --> 03:32:32,420
Bro!

5531
03:32:32,520 --> 03:32:39,040
No one helped me when I spammed the Avenger flake!

5532
03:32:44,230 --> 03:32:45,810
That's actually tilting.

5533
03:32:46,110 --> 03:32:47,930
That's actually tilting.

5534
03:32:48,150 --> 03:32:49,570
RIP Doki's 1k.

5535
03:32:49,830 --> 03:32:52,390
You see, I have a solution for this.

5536
03:33:02,840 --> 03:33:04,420
What 1k?

5537
03:33:14,040 --> 03:33:15,300
What 1k?

5538
03:33:15,400 --> 03:33:16,920
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

5539
03:33:17,160 --> 03:33:18,620
I'm gonna use the fucking...

5540
03:33:18,620 --> 03:33:22,340
Now I'm negative win rate again.

5541
03:33:23,340 --> 03:33:24,560
That's sad.

5542
03:33:28,140 --> 03:33:28,820
Alright,

5543
03:33:32,100 --> 03:33:33,460
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

5544
03:33:33,760 --> 03:33:35,000
We are back.

5545
03:33:35,120 --> 03:33:35,520
Chat.

5546
03:34:25,930 --> 03:34:27,130
Yo, yo, yo.

5547
03:34:27,290 --> 03:34:28,470
How you guys doing?

5548
03:34:32,930 --> 03:34:33,410
Shit!

5549
03:34:34,550 --> 03:34:35,330
I'm back.

5550
03:34:37,370 --> 03:34:38,070
I'm back.

5551
03:34:38,210 --> 03:34:38,710
It's okay.

5552
03:34:39,570 --> 03:34:40,550
It's okay guys.

5553
03:34:40,830 --> 03:34:41,190
It's okay.

5554
03:34:41,250 --> 03:34:41,870
Everything's okay.

5555
03:34:44,050 --> 03:34:44,730
We're okay.

5556
03:34:47,030 --> 03:34:47,650
It's okay.

5557
03:34:49,370 --> 03:34:50,450
We can do this.

5558
03:34:54,430 --> 03:34:55,590
Just in time.

5559
03:34:57,030 --> 03:34:57,990
Is he gonna make portal?

5560
03:34:58,710 --> 03:34:59,370
There you go.

5561
03:34:59,510 --> 03:35:00,250
Yay, portal!

5562
03:35:02,850 --> 03:35:03,510
Watch this.

5563
03:35:07,050 --> 03:35:07,850
Hell yeah.

5564
03:35:07,990 --> 03:35:08,930
Get predicted.

5565
03:35:10,630 --> 03:35:11,870
No, no, wow.

5566
03:35:15,260 --> 03:35:17,340
Oh my god, they have a junk as well.

5567
03:35:17,800 --> 03:35:19,420
Was this the junk from the last game?

5568
03:35:19,620 --> 03:35:20,140
I can't tell.

5569
03:35:21,300 --> 03:35:21,760
No!

5570
03:35:23,320 --> 03:35:24,520
Wait, the ram is anti.

5571
03:35:24,600 --> 03:35:25,020
He can die.

5572
03:35:25,500 --> 03:35:26,140
Can he?

5573
03:35:26,300 --> 03:35:26,940
Are you sure?

5574
03:35:27,260 --> 03:35:28,380
Are you sure about that?

5575
03:35:28,980 --> 03:35:29,760
Are you...

5576
03:35:29,760 --> 03:35:31,860
Are you 100% about that?

5577
03:35:32,400 --> 03:35:33,200
Are you...

5578
03:35:33,200 --> 03:35:34,160
Okay, nice.

5579
03:35:34,700 --> 03:35:35,540
He can die.

5580
03:35:36,040 --> 03:35:37,060
He's antied again.

5581
03:35:37,220 --> 03:35:37,680
Good job.

5582
03:35:38,820 --> 03:35:40,300
I can keep doing this forever.

5583
03:35:42,320 --> 03:35:42,800
Okay.

5584
03:35:43,220 --> 03:35:46,120
I actually might have to go Kiriko because they have Ana.

5585
03:35:46,940 --> 03:35:47,840
Oh wait, they don't!

5586
03:35:47,860 --> 03:35:48,520
They don't have Ana!

5587
03:35:48,660 --> 03:35:49,200
I can stay!

5588
03:35:49,700 --> 03:35:51,100
Get back here!

5589
03:35:52,880 --> 03:35:54,000
I can stay Ana!

5590
03:35:54,460 --> 03:35:55,720
I don't have to go Kiriko!

5591
03:35:56,220 --> 03:35:58,000
Oh my god.

5592
03:35:59,240 --> 03:36:02,420
Oh, saw life flash by before my eyes.

5593
03:36:04,260 --> 03:36:04,740
Okay.

5594
03:36:04,840 --> 03:36:06,500
Whoa, I have nano in like one game.

5595
03:36:06,720 --> 03:36:07,380
Holy shit.

5596
03:36:07,620 --> 03:36:10,740
I just build it off of... that means they have DPL assault soon.

5597
03:36:10,960 --> 03:36:13,100
Because I fucking farm this nano off of.

5598
03:36:14,720 --> 03:36:15,200
What?

5599
03:36:15,460 --> 03:36:16,420
Alright, I take those.

5600
03:36:23,290 --> 03:36:23,810
Okay.

5601
03:36:25,250 --> 03:36:25,770
Go!

5602
03:36:27,850 --> 03:36:29,010
Just do anything!

5603
03:36:29,510 --> 03:36:30,590
Just do anything!

5604
03:36:31,270 --> 03:36:32,830
This is the anything nano!

5605
03:36:34,270 --> 03:36:35,010
There you go.

5606
03:36:35,350 --> 03:36:36,450
I just don't miss.

5607
03:36:38,130 --> 03:36:40,510
It only took four hours to warm up, guys.

5608
03:36:43,370 --> 03:36:47,010
It just took four hours to warm up but we're here now.

5609
03:36:48,070 --> 03:36:49,430
We're here, we made it.

5610
03:36:51,210 --> 03:36:52,530
We fucking made it!

5611
03:36:56,310 --> 03:36:57,270
You fucking made it!

5612
03:36:57,270 --> 03:36:57,950
Where's the Pharah?

5613
03:36:58,570 --> 03:37:01,070
I was like, does he exist in my game?

5614
03:37:03,750 --> 03:37:05,390
Guys, I also hit those.

5615
03:37:07,690 --> 03:37:08,410
Let's see.

5616
03:37:08,670 --> 03:37:09,890
Oh, he's so dead.

5617
03:37:10,650 --> 03:37:12,010
He's so fucking dead.

5618
03:37:12,050 --> 03:37:12,390
I'm okay.

5619
03:37:12,890 --> 03:37:13,810
He's so dead.

5620
03:37:15,610 --> 03:37:16,710
I'm not okay.

5621
03:37:16,730 --> 03:37:17,170
I lied.

5622
03:37:17,730 --> 03:37:18,130
Why did you not run out?

5623
03:37:18,130 --> 03:37:19,190
Why did you not run out?

5624
03:37:19,570 --> 03:37:20,510
I'm under attack!

5625
03:37:21,190 --> 03:37:23,110
Alright, I guess I'll back up a little bit.

5626
03:37:23,110 --> 03:37:24,790
I guess I'll... Thank you.

5627
03:37:24,870 --> 03:37:26,410
The Junkrat helped me back up.

5628
03:37:28,290 --> 03:37:29,170
Oh, alright.

5629
03:37:29,350 --> 03:37:30,210
And we all split up.

5630
03:37:31,310 --> 03:37:31,790
Please.

5631
03:37:32,050 --> 03:37:32,530
Please.

5632
03:37:32,570 --> 03:37:34,010
Oh my god.

5633
03:37:34,070 --> 03:37:34,590
Thank you.

5634
03:37:36,310 --> 03:37:36,970
Thank you.

5635
03:37:39,890 --> 03:37:41,010
Oh my god, we're okay.

5636
03:37:41,670 --> 03:37:43,010
I told you I'll be okay.

5637
03:37:44,810 --> 03:37:48,910
Alright, all DPS are at different angles.

5638
03:37:49,190 --> 03:37:50,210
Where do we go?

5639
03:37:50,290 --> 03:37:50,970
I don't know.

5640
03:37:53,450 --> 03:37:54,570
Oh, I see.

5641
03:37:57,030 --> 03:37:59,350
Which is the right side to look at?

5642
03:37:59,430 --> 03:38:00,290
I don't know.

5643
03:38:00,550 --> 03:38:01,390
Oh, my HP.

5644
03:38:03,170 --> 03:38:03,870
There you go.

5645
03:38:04,170 --> 03:38:05,410
It is winnable.

5646
03:38:07,590 --> 03:38:09,150
Oh, he's just better.

5647
03:38:09,870 --> 03:38:10,830
He's just better.

5648
03:38:13,690 --> 03:38:14,890
I told you.

5649
03:38:15,230 --> 03:38:16,030
We'll be fine.

5650
03:38:18,350 --> 03:38:19,070
I missed.

5651
03:38:21,950 --> 03:38:22,910
He has to die.

5652
03:38:27,280 --> 03:38:28,820
No, we lost our fucking...

5653
03:38:28,820 --> 03:38:29,420
It's not the theory.

5654
03:38:29,500 --> 03:38:30,080
So this is winnable.

5655
03:38:30,920 --> 03:38:31,440
Is it?

5656
03:38:34,540 --> 03:38:36,620
It didn't feel winnable for me.

5657
03:38:38,340 --> 03:38:38,960
Oh, wait.

5658
03:38:38,960 --> 03:38:39,520
They flipped.

5659
03:38:39,700 --> 03:38:40,020
They flipped.

5660
03:38:41,340 --> 03:38:42,260
Oh, it is winnable.

5661
03:38:42,340 --> 03:38:42,740
It is.

5662
03:38:45,100 --> 03:38:46,020
My first death.

5663
03:38:46,100 --> 03:38:46,400
No.

5664
03:38:49,260 --> 03:38:50,440
My first death.

5665
03:38:50,640 --> 03:38:51,060
No.

5666
03:38:53,460 --> 03:38:54,160
I'm so sorry.

5667
03:38:54,280 --> 03:38:54,960
Okay, he apologized.

5668
03:38:55,000 --> 03:38:55,500
It's okay.

5669
03:38:55,820 --> 03:38:56,840
Thank you for the super chat.

5670
03:38:56,940 --> 03:38:57,140
Thank you.

5671
03:39:01,340 --> 03:39:01,940
That's alright.

5672
03:39:04,360 --> 03:39:07,640
Okay, guys, I bet we're going to win four games in a row.

5673
03:39:07,800 --> 03:39:09,020
I can feel it.

5674
03:39:09,960 --> 03:39:11,000
I can feel it guys.

5675
03:39:11,660 --> 03:39:12,880
Four games in a row.

5676
03:39:14,220 --> 03:39:16,200
I have more damage than the fucking Brig.

5677
03:39:16,780 --> 03:39:18,060
I can fucking feel this.

5678
03:39:22,440 --> 03:39:24,660
They also, they don't have a Kiriko.

5679
03:39:24,660 --> 03:39:24,760
Let's go.

5680
03:39:24,880 --> 03:39:26,300
So they don't have to cleanse.

5681
03:39:26,740 --> 03:39:27,260
Surely.

5682
03:39:28,180 --> 03:39:29,820
All I have to do is just one Trigana.

5683
03:39:30,840 --> 03:39:32,020
Then we can do this.

5684
03:39:36,100 --> 03:39:38,680
First game watching the other healer carry?

5685
03:39:38,800 --> 03:39:40,480
What do you mean other healer?

5686
03:39:40,540 --> 03:39:41,400
I'm carrying!

5687
03:39:46,700 --> 03:39:47,220
Alright.

5688
03:39:47,220 --> 03:39:47,740
Nice.

5689
03:39:51,100 --> 03:39:51,840
Are they going?

5690
03:39:52,100 --> 03:39:53,140
No they are dude.

5691
03:39:53,440 --> 03:39:53,980
Ow.

5692
03:39:54,700 --> 03:39:55,700
Oh I hit something.

5693
03:39:57,420 --> 03:39:58,940
Cool guys don't look at antis.

5694
03:40:04,240 --> 03:40:05,360
Oh shit nice.

5695
03:40:06,680 --> 03:40:08,240
There you go.

5696
03:40:08,300 --> 03:40:09,040
He's also asleep!

5697
03:40:09,520 --> 03:40:11,540
He did not have a good time!

5698
03:40:13,540 --> 03:40:14,620
Holy shit!

5699
03:40:14,840 --> 03:40:16,820
That man got fucking bullied.

5700
03:40:17,740 --> 03:40:18,880
Oh my god!

5701
03:40:18,940 --> 03:40:19,620
That poor guy!

5702
03:40:21,940 --> 03:40:23,340
That poor man!

5703
03:40:26,240 --> 03:40:28,960
That guy was not having it at all.

5704
03:40:29,080 --> 03:40:29,460
No!

5705
03:40:29,800 --> 03:40:31,060
He has an Ana!

5706
03:40:31,720 --> 03:40:32,480
No!

5707
03:40:32,480 --> 03:40:35,120
It's gonna be Kiriko's duty soon!

5708
03:40:37,320 --> 03:40:38,080
No...

5709
03:40:39,400 --> 03:40:41,100
It's Kiriko time.

5710
03:40:44,660 --> 03:40:45,420
No...

5711
03:40:47,820 --> 03:40:48,740
No...

5712
03:40:50,460 --> 03:40:52,120
And a Widow!

5713
03:40:53,300 --> 03:40:54,160
And a Widow!

5714
03:40:54,160 --> 03:40:54,900
Bro what?

5715
03:40:55,940 --> 03:40:56,860
Bro what?

5716
03:40:57,320 --> 03:40:57,640
Bro what?

5717
03:41:00,200 --> 03:41:01,120
Bro...

5718
03:41:01,740 --> 03:41:03,660
Bro please have mercy.

5719
03:41:04,160 --> 03:41:06,460
Bro please have mercy.

5720
03:41:06,940 --> 03:41:09,340
Oh please don't look at me.

5721
03:41:09,480 --> 03:41:11,180
Please don't look at me.

5722
03:41:15,950 --> 03:41:16,870
Guys...

5723
03:41:17,950 --> 03:41:20,430
Guys... I have to... Guys...

5724
03:41:20,430 --> 03:41:20,430
I have to...

5725
03:41:20,450 --> 03:41:22,190
I have to play Kiriko.

5726
03:41:24,290 --> 03:41:24,930
No...

5727
03:41:26,430 --> 03:41:29,110
It was gonna be a happy moment.

5728
03:41:29,470 --> 03:41:29,890
It was gonna be a happy moment.

5729
03:41:30,290 --> 03:41:33,830
I could have felt happiness for a second.

5730
03:41:34,190 --> 03:41:35,470
I could have felt happiness for a second.

5731
03:41:35,770 --> 03:41:36,850
Oh woah!

5732
03:41:37,230 --> 03:41:38,550
Jesus Christ!

5733
03:41:39,250 --> 03:41:40,630
Oh I'm scared.

5734
03:41:40,850 --> 03:41:41,730
I'm so scared.

5735
03:41:41,970 --> 03:41:43,950
He almost has Visor though.

5736
03:41:44,030 --> 03:41:47,070
I need to wait for first one.

5737
03:41:47,270 --> 03:41:48,490
Oh that's nice.

5738
03:41:48,490 --> 03:41:49,070
Oh!

5739
03:41:49,430 --> 03:41:52,230
Oh this is not good.

5740
03:41:52,550 --> 03:41:53,510
This is not good.

5741
03:41:53,930 --> 03:41:54,750
This is not good.

5742
03:41:55,110 --> 03:41:56,630
There's no way he can die.

5743
03:41:56,910 --> 03:41:57,770
There's no way.

5744
03:41:58,050 --> 03:41:58,410
We...

5745
03:41:58,890 --> 03:41:59,690
See we did it!

5746
03:41:59,790 --> 03:42:00,070
We did it!

5747
03:42:00,090 --> 03:42:00,410
We did it!

5748
03:42:00,450 --> 03:42:00,710
We did it!

5749
03:42:00,790 --> 03:42:01,070
We did it!

5750
03:42:05,210 --> 03:42:05,970
We're doing it!

5751
03:42:06,850 --> 03:42:07,210
Okay...

5752
03:42:11,210 --> 03:42:12,830
Now we're doing it.

5753
03:42:13,810 --> 03:42:14,170
Alright...

5754
03:42:15,770 --> 03:42:16,790
We're doing it.

5755
03:42:21,590 --> 03:42:23,170
Now we're doing it.

5756
03:42:23,190 --> 03:42:23,770
Now we're doing it.

5757
03:42:23,770 --> 03:42:24,390
Yeah.

5758
03:42:24,930 --> 03:42:27,010
I have cleanse.

5759
03:42:27,590 --> 03:42:29,350
I can't do anything now.

5760
03:42:31,550 --> 03:42:32,310
Sorry.

5761
03:42:32,650 --> 03:42:34,130
Are you fucking...

5762
03:42:34,130 --> 03:42:38,590
The fucking bait.

5763
03:42:40,170 --> 03:42:42,250
The fucking bait right there.

5764
03:42:42,490 --> 03:42:42,530
The fucking bait right there.

5765
03:42:42,530 --> 03:42:43,830
The fucking bait right there.

5766
03:42:44,050 --> 03:42:45,110
Oh he did!

5767
03:42:47,610 --> 03:42:48,370
Oh!

5768
03:42:48,370 --> 03:42:48,630
There you go.

5769
03:42:48,770 --> 03:42:49,310
Oh!

5770
03:42:49,530 --> 03:42:51,330
The double headshot!

5771
03:42:52,130 --> 03:42:53,210
Where is she?

5772
03:42:53,590 --> 03:42:55,150
Where is she?

5773
03:42:55,730 --> 03:42:56,430
Sagger her.

5774
03:42:56,510 --> 03:42:56,890
Sagger her.

5775
03:42:56,970 --> 03:42:57,290
Sagger her.

5776
03:42:59,650 --> 03:43:00,990
Alright there you go.

5777
03:43:01,590 --> 03:43:02,430
Hanzo buff.

5778
03:43:02,610 --> 03:43:03,970
Yeah I heard about the Hanzo buff.

5779
03:43:04,530 --> 03:43:05,070
Please.

5780
03:43:05,390 --> 03:43:07,130
Not the Hanzo buff though.

5781
03:43:07,190 --> 03:43:08,390
I'm tired of Hanzo buffs.

5782
03:43:13,370 --> 03:43:14,430
Alright I'm helping.

5783
03:43:15,790 --> 03:43:16,610
I'm helping.

5784
03:43:19,750 --> 03:43:20,290
Oh!

5785
03:43:20,990 --> 03:43:21,610
Woohoohoo!

5786
03:43:22,010 --> 03:43:25,650
Okay that hook was actually insane though.

5787
03:43:25,890 --> 03:43:28,210
That was an insane hook.

5788
03:43:28,370 --> 03:43:28,790
That was an insane hook.

5789
03:43:29,330 --> 03:43:31,090
We can literally kill him.

5790
03:43:33,170 --> 03:43:33,970
Bam!

5791
03:43:34,670 --> 03:43:35,470
Thank...

5792
03:43:37,810 --> 03:43:39,990
I saw it live.

5793
03:43:40,570 --> 03:43:42,610
What an insane hook.

5794
03:43:47,280 --> 03:43:48,740
You should have picked Mercy.

5795
03:43:49,140 --> 03:43:50,600
I won the game!

5796
03:43:50,600 --> 03:43:52,780
What do you mean I should have picked Mercy?

5797
03:43:53,440 --> 03:43:54,300
Okay guys.

5798
03:43:54,460 --> 03:43:55,320
We're almost back.

5799
03:43:55,520 --> 03:43:57,600
Guys we're at a positive win rate!

5800
03:43:58,360 --> 03:43:59,120
I think.

5801
03:43:59,300 --> 03:44:01,220
I can never tell anymore.

5802
03:44:01,500 --> 03:44:03,180
I can't tell anymore.

5803
03:44:04,360 --> 03:44:05,900
You've been killing me for so long.

5804
03:44:06,120 --> 03:44:09,140
I don't know which is positive and which wasn't.

5805
03:44:09,200 --> 03:44:12,220
I might as well make my waiting room right now for the next stream.

5806
03:44:13,860 --> 03:44:15,220
Just in case.

5807
03:44:15,980 --> 03:44:17,260
Just in case.

5808
03:44:17,260 --> 03:44:20,200
I'm gonna make my waiting room for the next stream.

5809
03:44:20,420 --> 03:44:22,960
Cause it's a good night dra- Alright guys give me a title.

5810
03:44:23,540 --> 03:44:26,940
What should the title be for my good night dragoons number 3?

5811
03:44:28,540 --> 03:44:28,980
Guys.

5812
03:44:29,300 --> 03:44:30,520
What should the title be?

5813
03:44:31,140 --> 03:44:32,700
Hey Doki it's my birthday today!

5814
03:44:32,900 --> 03:44:35,360
Any chance I could get a happy birthday from the coolest thief around?

5815
03:44:35,560 --> 03:44:36,240
Thank you for the super chat!

5816
03:44:36,440 --> 03:44:37,780
King thank you thank you!

5817
03:44:37,820 --> 03:44:38,160
Of course!

5818
03:44:38,460 --> 03:44:39,840
Happy birthday to you!

5819
03:44:40,040 --> 03:44:43,080
Happy birthday dear King!

5820
03:44:43,080 --> 03:44:44,760
Happy birthday to you!

5821
03:44:44,920 --> 03:44:45,300
Yeah!

5822
03:44:46,180 --> 03:44:48,740
We're not stopping until we get...

5823
03:44:48,740 --> 03:44:50,180
Wait what's top 500 right now?

5824
03:44:50,480 --> 03:44:51,460
What is it?

5825
03:44:51,840 --> 03:44:53,240
Competitive leaderboard.

5826
03:44:53,640 --> 03:44:57,340
This is on Asia because I made my account where I used to live in Asia.

5827
03:44:57,500 --> 03:44:58,800
So that's a little awkward.

5828
03:45:00,920 --> 03:45:01,480
Alright.

5829
03:45:01,760 --> 03:45:02,540
Masters 4?

5830
03:45:02,820 --> 03:45:04,080
Okay we're not stop...

5831
03:45:04,080 --> 03:45:05,960
Okay we're gonna stop at Masters 5.

5832
03:45:06,140 --> 03:45:08,680
I have no patience to keep going.

5833
03:45:10,380 --> 03:45:13,060
I have no patience to play this.

5834
03:45:13,080 --> 03:45:14,660
I have no patience to play this.

5835
03:45:14,840 --> 03:45:15,940
I have no patience to play this.

5836
03:45:16,740 --> 03:45:19,840
That's way too many games to do.

5837
03:45:20,200 --> 03:45:20,800
That's way too many games to do.

5838
03:45:20,800 --> 03:45:22,000
Okay what is this...

5839
03:45:22,900 --> 03:45:23,580
Uh...

5840
03:45:25,660 --> 03:45:26,340
Uh...

5841
03:45:27,080 --> 03:45:29,300
We're not gonna get 700k.

5842
03:45:29,360 --> 03:45:32,200
We're not gonna get 700k subscribers today.

5843
03:45:32,460 --> 03:45:32,620
We're not gonna get 700k subscribers today.

5844
03:45:32,620 --> 03:45:33,620
I don't think so.

5845
03:45:35,180 --> 03:45:35,860
Uh...

5846
03:45:35,860 --> 03:45:38,180
We're like 1000 off.

5847
03:45:38,300 --> 03:45:39,820
That's way too many thousands.

5848
03:45:40,320 --> 03:45:43,060
One is way too many thousands.

5849
03:45:43,080 --> 03:45:43,320
That's a little sentence.

5850
03:45:48,920 --> 03:45:52,560
Alright, let me see.

5851
03:45:54,280 --> 03:45:57,660
I'm gonna put thumbnail art here.

5852
03:45:57,720 --> 03:45:58,920
That's just one.

5853
03:46:00,760 --> 03:46:02,100
Someone had like, what was it?

5854
03:46:02,180 --> 03:46:07,360
Post overwatch detoxing after Overwatch 2.

5855
03:46:08,160 --> 03:46:08,960
That's good.

5856
03:46:09,140 --> 03:46:10,640
Winners after party.

5857
03:46:10,640 --> 03:46:11,080
No!

5858
03:46:11,640 --> 03:46:13,680
Don't say I couldn't reach Overwatch.

5859
03:46:13,680 --> 03:46:15,280
I couldn't reach Masters.

5860
03:46:16,660 --> 03:46:17,600
That's not true.

5861
03:46:17,860 --> 03:46:19,640
That's not true and I'm gonna show you guys.

5862
03:46:19,880 --> 03:46:20,980
Post overwatch suffering.

5863
03:46:21,160 --> 03:46:21,660
I like that.

5864
03:46:22,500 --> 03:46:23,000
I like that.

5865
03:46:23,120 --> 03:46:24,680
Post overwatch suffering.

5866
03:46:29,820 --> 03:46:31,580
I got Masters.

5867
03:46:31,680 --> 03:46:33,000
I got Masters.

5868
03:46:33,220 --> 03:46:33,740
Yay.

5869
03:46:33,740 --> 03:46:33,840
Yay.

5870
03:46:39,420 --> 03:46:40,800
That's gonna be the title.

5871
03:46:40,920 --> 03:46:41,680
I got Masters.

5872
03:46:41,860 --> 03:46:42,160
Yay.

5873
03:46:42,580 --> 03:46:43,020
Hey.

5874
03:46:45,500 --> 03:46:46,440
Oh hey!

5875
03:46:46,600 --> 03:46:48,240
This guy likes...

5876
03:46:49,900 --> 03:46:51,280
He likes...

5877
03:46:52,420 --> 03:46:53,360
He likes barbecue.

5878
03:46:54,660 --> 03:46:55,420
That's...

5879
03:46:55,420 --> 03:46:59,680
That means barbecue, right?

5880
03:47:00,060 --> 03:47:00,600
See?

5881
03:47:07,540 --> 03:47:08,760
That's the cue, right?

5882
03:47:09,140 --> 03:47:10,080
That's what it means.

5883
03:47:10,180 --> 03:47:10,840
Barbecue lover.

5884
03:47:11,520 --> 03:47:12,500
Oh my god.

5885
03:47:16,440 --> 03:47:17,040
Yeah.

5886
03:47:17,040 --> 03:47:20,860
He likes barbecue but specifically the chicken in barbecue.

5887
03:47:21,640 --> 03:47:22,680
That's why...

5888
03:47:24,140 --> 03:47:25,760
That's why... No!

5889
03:47:25,860 --> 03:47:27,220
He likes the BBC News!

5890
03:47:27,760 --> 03:47:28,860
I almost forgot!

5891
03:47:29,140 --> 03:47:30,060
He must be British!

5892
03:47:31,000 --> 03:47:31,600
Guys!

5893
03:47:32,080 --> 03:47:32,980
He must...

5894
03:47:33,740 --> 03:47:35,360
He must love the BBC News!

5895
03:47:35,640 --> 03:47:36,960
He's from British!

5896
03:47:37,400 --> 03:47:39,000
He's playing on NA servers!

5897
03:47:39,440 --> 03:47:41,960
He's EU playing on NA servers!

5898
03:47:42,480 --> 03:47:43,820
It has to be it!

5899
03:47:46,520 --> 03:47:47,140
Shit.

5900
03:47:47,720 --> 03:47:49,180
What else could it be?

5901
03:47:49,300 --> 03:47:50,520
I don't understand.

5902
03:47:51,560 --> 03:47:55,020
If it's not the BBC News, what else could it be?

5903
03:47:55,860 --> 03:47:57,620
There's no other alternatives.

5904
03:47:58,160 --> 03:48:00,780
The BBC News is copyrighted.

5905
03:48:00,780 --> 03:48:01,880
It's trademarked.

5906
03:48:05,000 --> 03:48:05,560
Guys!

5907
03:48:05,660 --> 03:48:10,060
All I'm saying... BBC News is trademarked so it can't be anything else.

5908
03:48:14,610 --> 03:48:15,590
Oh my god.

5909
03:48:15,730 --> 03:48:18,210
This fucking ham is just going a merry-go-round.

5910
03:48:20,510 --> 03:48:21,070
Oh.

5911
03:48:21,990 --> 03:48:26,250
Poor... I think we... I think we are... Oh!

5912
03:48:26,490 --> 03:48:27,050
Oh!

5913
03:48:27,690 --> 03:48:29,030
I missed through that.

5914
03:48:29,250 --> 03:48:30,810
I missed through that hard.

5915
03:48:33,350 --> 03:48:33,710
Goodbye.

5916
03:48:34,430 --> 03:48:35,210
They don't know...

5917
03:48:35,210 --> 03:48:35,650
They do!

5918
03:48:35,730 --> 03:48:36,010
They do!

5919
03:48:36,030 --> 03:48:36,310
They do!

5920
03:48:36,330 --> 03:48:36,650
They do!

5921
03:48:36,670 --> 03:48:36,950
They do!

5922
03:48:36,970 --> 03:48:37,110
They do!

5923
03:48:37,110 --> 03:48:37,150
They do!

5924
03:48:38,570 --> 03:48:39,550
They didn't know that.

5925
03:48:41,690 --> 03:48:42,530
Oh my god.

5926
03:48:42,550 --> 03:48:42,950
You live.

5927
03:48:45,930 --> 03:48:46,290
Go!

5928
03:48:46,290 --> 03:48:46,650
Go!

5929
03:48:46,710 --> 03:48:47,070
Go!

5930
03:48:47,190 --> 03:48:47,470
Go!

5931
03:48:47,550 --> 03:48:47,790
Go!

5932
03:48:47,850 --> 03:48:48,130
Go!

5933
03:48:48,150 --> 03:48:48,350
Go!

5934
03:48:48,510 --> 03:48:48,530
Go!

5935
03:48:51,710 --> 03:48:52,430
Huge cleanse.

5936
03:48:52,730 --> 03:48:54,390
I mean it was pretty big.

5937
03:48:54,890 --> 03:48:56,430
This is as big as BBC News.

5938
03:48:57,250 --> 03:48:58,130
No Suzu?

5939
03:49:00,970 --> 03:49:02,010
There you go.

5940
03:49:02,110 --> 03:49:02,490
Oh!

5941
03:49:10,410 --> 03:49:11,390
We can kill Brig.

5942
03:49:11,430 --> 03:49:12,030
We can kill Brig.

5943
03:49:12,030 --> 03:49:12,170
We can kill Brig.

5944
03:49:12,170 --> 03:49:12,490
Can we?

5945
03:49:12,810 --> 03:49:13,870
Can we though?

5946
03:49:14,050 --> 03:49:15,290
I don't think so!

5947
03:49:19,310 --> 03:49:20,190
Oh shit.

5948
03:49:20,370 --> 03:49:21,970
Wait, we got the D.Va mech though.

5949
03:49:25,290 --> 03:49:25,730
Okay.

5950
03:49:26,470 --> 03:49:27,530
We gotta kill Sombra.

5951
03:49:28,510 --> 03:49:29,470
Oh no.

5952
03:49:29,750 --> 03:49:30,770
Oh no.

5953
03:49:31,110 --> 03:49:31,930
I'm... No!

5954
03:49:35,970 --> 03:49:40,530
Guys, I don't think... I don't think we got this guys.

5955
03:49:41,110 --> 03:49:42,590
I don't think we got this.

5956
03:49:45,010 --> 03:49:48,070
How can your team knock... That is a very good question!

5957
03:49:48,930 --> 03:49:49,450
Team?

5958
03:49:49,450 --> 03:49:51,350
How could you guys not kill her?

5959
03:49:53,350 --> 03:49:54,290
She's so dead.

5960
03:49:54,610 --> 03:49:55,610
She's so dead.

5961
03:49:58,470 --> 03:50:00,310
I forced the fucking...

5962
03:50:01,550 --> 03:50:03,310
Alright, I'm just gonna TP here.

5963
03:50:06,210 --> 03:50:07,650
I'm gonna force this.

5964
03:50:08,170 --> 03:50:10,090
And then I'm gonna TP back up top.

5965
03:50:10,710 --> 03:50:12,170
And that's how portals work.

5966
03:50:14,930 --> 03:50:19,430
I don't... I don't... I have to stay as main healer because we have Mercy so heal...

5967
03:50:19,430 --> 03:50:25,430
Zen is really bad with... Zen is so bad with Mercy heals.

5968
03:50:25,650 --> 03:50:27,510
Because there's not enough heals for Mercy.

5969
03:50:27,510 --> 03:50:30,150
So I have to play as a main healer.

5970
03:50:32,310 --> 03:50:33,750
Oh, I feel...

5971
03:50:35,530 --> 03:50:38,610
I'm like thinking about maybe going Ana.

5972
03:50:38,850 --> 03:50:42,010
But like I feel like I'm just gonna get harassed as...

5973
03:50:44,090 --> 03:50:48,050
I feel like I'm gonna get like hard like fucked over as Ana.

5974
03:50:49,590 --> 03:50:51,070
Oh my god!

5975
03:50:55,570 --> 03:50:56,050
Me?

5976
03:50:56,210 --> 03:50:56,770
I'll try.

5977
03:50:56,950 --> 03:50:57,110
I'll try.

5978
03:50:57,210 --> 03:50:57,430
Woo!

5979
03:50:57,430 --> 03:50:59,690
I can try Ana.

5980
03:51:00,190 --> 03:51:03,150
I'll try Ana and see if I'll be okay.

5981
03:51:04,630 --> 03:51:07,230
Cause like looking at this...

5982
03:51:07,230 --> 03:51:12,250
I don't think my team will save me from the Hamlin Tracer dive.

5983
03:51:12,670 --> 03:51:14,050
So I can't tell.

5984
03:51:15,930 --> 03:51:17,250
I mean we'll see.

5985
03:51:17,510 --> 03:51:19,030
We'll see if I'll survive.

5986
03:51:19,730 --> 03:51:21,190
I got you.

5987
03:51:21,470 --> 03:51:22,730
Enemies on the payload.

5988
03:51:22,990 --> 03:51:24,090
Let's get them.

5989
03:51:25,230 --> 03:51:26,450
We just need a Sombra.

5990
03:51:27,430 --> 03:51:28,770
We literally just need a Sombra.

5991
03:51:28,950 --> 03:51:30,330
And then we should be fine.

5992
03:51:31,810 --> 03:51:33,770
Why can't the news help us now?

5993
03:51:34,890 --> 03:51:35,190
Aww.

5994
03:51:39,870 --> 03:51:40,470
Nice.

5995
03:51:40,770 --> 03:51:41,350
Good kill.

5996
03:51:42,310 --> 03:51:43,390
We can kill both.

5997
03:51:44,010 --> 03:51:45,050
Why is this...

5998
03:51:45,650 --> 03:51:46,530
There we go.

5999
03:51:48,210 --> 03:51:48,810
Goodbye.

6000
03:51:51,350 --> 03:51:52,830
Guess I die.

6001
03:51:53,290 --> 03:51:54,670
Guess I die.

6002
03:51:55,270 --> 03:51:57,110
Oh, guess I'll die again.

6003
03:51:57,410 --> 03:51:58,550
Guess I'll die again.

6004
03:52:03,570 --> 03:52:05,030
Yes, I'll die again.

6005
03:52:05,390 --> 03:52:09,970
Face your eyes Ohhh...

6006
03:52:09,970 --> 03:52:11,010
Guys...

6007
03:52:11,010 --> 03:52:11,970
This game is rough.

6008
03:52:12,170 --> 03:52:14,430
This game is absolutely rough.

6009
03:52:14,630 --> 03:52:14,790
That was really tough.

6010
03:52:15,350 --> 03:52:18,830
This game is absolutely...

6011
03:52:19,890 --> 03:52:22,110
All I'm saying...

6012
03:52:22,110 --> 03:52:25,610
Is that I know I'm avoiding a person here.

6013
03:52:26,110 --> 03:52:30,190
Easy Gamer.

6014
03:52:32,730 --> 03:52:34,510
We gotta kill their support!

6015
03:52:38,770 --> 03:52:39,530
No!

6016
03:52:39,530 --> 03:52:40,790
I slapped him!

6017
03:52:40,990 --> 03:52:42,090
He lives!

6018
03:52:43,250 --> 03:52:46,350
He fucking lives the D.Va bomb!

6019
03:52:46,870 --> 03:52:49,110
That's absolutely fucking crazy!

6020
03:52:51,330 --> 03:52:53,830
He actually lives the D.Va bomb.

6021
03:52:54,570 --> 03:52:55,810
I'm too fast for you.

6022
03:52:55,910 --> 03:52:56,850
Don't kill me.

6023
03:52:57,930 --> 03:52:58,710
There you go.

6024
03:52:59,430 --> 03:53:00,730
Can you kill Marge?

6025
03:53:01,130 --> 03:53:01,990
I can try.

6026
03:53:02,610 --> 03:53:03,750
I did my part.

6027
03:53:05,090 --> 03:53:06,210
Can you kill Kiri?

6028
03:53:06,230 --> 03:53:06,770
I don't want to get off.

6029
03:53:08,910 --> 03:53:09,390
Whoa!

6030
03:53:13,420 --> 03:53:13,900
Alright.

6031
03:53:15,000 --> 03:53:16,040
What a match.

6032
03:53:16,400 --> 03:53:18,580
Now we have two more minutes to hold this.

6033
03:53:18,920 --> 03:53:19,480
Let's go.

6034
03:53:19,640 --> 03:53:21,060
We used almost everything.

6035
03:53:24,760 --> 03:53:25,240
Alright.

6036
03:53:25,360 --> 03:53:26,040
I'm just not...

6037
03:53:26,060 --> 03:53:28,480
I'm not very confident with the Mercy pick right now.

6038
03:53:28,580 --> 03:53:29,920
With the Hammond and Tracer.

6039
03:53:30,380 --> 03:53:31,080
Straight on.

6040
03:53:31,260 --> 03:53:31,400
Oh!

6041
03:53:31,460 --> 03:53:31,800
End game!

6042
03:53:31,960 --> 03:53:32,080
Oh!

6043
03:53:32,120 --> 03:53:32,780
Nanner full time!

6044
03:53:32,940 --> 03:53:33,260
Let's go!

6045
03:53:34,420 --> 03:53:35,660
Let's fucking go!

6046
03:53:37,880 --> 03:53:38,360
Oh!

6047
03:53:38,400 --> 03:53:41,300
I feel even more confident now!

6048
03:53:46,780 --> 03:53:47,740
Oh god.

6049
03:53:47,940 --> 03:53:49,700
I'm fucking protecting you right now.

6050
03:53:50,900 --> 03:53:51,600
Oh god.

6051
03:53:51,700 --> 03:53:52,620
I'll heal here.

6052
03:53:56,140 --> 03:53:56,860
Please Mercy.

6053
03:53:58,580 --> 03:53:59,420
Please Mercy.

6054
03:54:01,200 --> 03:54:02,360
They're breaking dice!

6055
03:54:03,380 --> 03:54:04,420
Oh god!

6056
03:54:04,640 --> 03:54:05,620
Oh god!

6057
03:54:08,560 --> 03:54:09,120
Oh!

6058
03:54:09,280 --> 03:54:10,040
I'm alive!

6059
03:54:11,020 --> 03:54:11,580
No!

6060
03:54:11,840 --> 03:54:12,480
I'm depressed.

6061
03:54:15,380 --> 03:54:15,940
Guys!

6062
03:54:16,040 --> 03:54:19,560
I don't want to stand on the cart but I will do it for gaming!

6063
03:54:20,500 --> 03:54:21,060
Oh!

6064
03:54:25,950 --> 03:54:26,710
Oh god.

6065
03:54:26,710 --> 03:54:28,050
He's low!

6066
03:54:28,470 --> 03:54:29,090
Please!

6067
03:54:29,210 --> 03:54:30,530
I fucking killed...

6068
03:54:32,280 --> 03:54:34,100
Get off the point!

6069
03:54:34,800 --> 03:54:35,480
No!

6070
03:54:38,600 --> 03:54:39,280
No!

6071
03:54:44,640 --> 03:54:47,220
I just got nano too.

6072
03:54:50,440 --> 03:54:53,520
I live for so long on the cart.

6073
03:54:53,800 --> 03:54:56,740
Because no one else wants to go on the cart.

6074
03:54:56,740 --> 03:54:59,940
Why is the poor Ana on the cart duty?

6075
03:55:00,500 --> 03:55:01,220
Why?

6076
03:55:09,870 --> 03:55:13,510
The poor Ana has to be on cart duty.

6077
03:55:13,630 --> 03:55:14,650
The old lady.

6078
03:55:19,490 --> 03:55:21,650
Somebody give me a life alert.

6079
03:55:21,830 --> 03:55:24,890
This old lady should not be on cart duty.

6080
03:55:25,450 --> 03:55:27,450
Please BBC News!

6081
03:55:27,790 --> 03:55:28,710
Save us!

6082
03:55:32,270 --> 03:55:33,850
I've got a good feeling.

6083
03:55:34,090 --> 03:55:35,490
This could be our family's fault.

6084
03:55:39,170 --> 03:55:39,610
Okay.

6085
03:55:39,610 --> 03:55:40,830
Post Overwatch.

6086
03:55:41,690 --> 03:55:43,050
Relax stream.

6087
03:55:44,090 --> 03:55:44,810
There we go.

6088
03:55:45,490 --> 03:55:45,930
Alright.

6089
03:55:46,070 --> 03:55:48,010
I'm just making my waiting room right now.

6090
03:55:48,590 --> 03:55:49,810
Because we have to.

6091
03:55:50,270 --> 03:55:51,230
You want to try dive?

6092
03:55:51,410 --> 03:55:51,610
Okay.

6093
03:55:51,670 --> 03:55:52,650
Just one more mission.

6094
03:55:54,030 --> 03:55:54,470
9pm.

6095
03:55:54,710 --> 03:55:55,250
Yeah, I think it's ready.

6096
03:55:55,250 --> 03:55:56,230
Are the streams at 9pm?

6097
03:55:56,330 --> 03:55:57,290
I don't even remember.

6098
03:55:57,770 --> 03:55:57,890
I'm gonna hack the Ana.

6099
03:55:57,890 --> 03:55:58,850
Okay.

6100
03:55:58,890 --> 03:56:00,170
I'll go Kiriko then.

6101
03:56:00,970 --> 03:56:01,990
This is fine.

6102
03:56:02,950 --> 03:56:03,430
There we go.

6103
03:56:04,310 --> 03:56:07,510
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get Masteries, guys.

6104
03:56:09,870 --> 03:56:12,310
We'll be so relaxed by then.

6105
03:56:15,110 --> 03:56:15,750
Okay.

6106
03:56:16,870 --> 03:56:19,530
Why can't the BBC News help us?

6107
03:56:19,810 --> 03:56:20,950
I don't understand.

6108
03:56:22,610 --> 03:56:24,630
There's a reason why I don't want to go.

6109
03:56:24,750 --> 03:56:25,810
There's always two or whatever.

6110
03:56:26,530 --> 03:56:27,730
I can't.

6111
03:56:27,730 --> 03:56:28,130
I'm dying.

6112
03:56:29,050 --> 03:56:30,250
Maybe I should care.

6113
03:56:31,230 --> 03:56:31,750
See?

6114
03:56:31,890 --> 03:56:32,750
More on the Mercy.

6115
03:56:32,890 --> 03:56:33,330
No, no, no.

6116
03:56:33,330 --> 03:56:33,750
Not ready.

6117
03:56:33,850 --> 03:56:34,110
Not ready.

6118
03:56:37,690 --> 03:56:41,290
Why did I decide to play fucking Kiriko?

6119
03:56:42,090 --> 03:56:44,630
I knew playing Kiriko was a mistake.

6120
03:56:46,310 --> 03:56:47,370
I knew it.

6121
03:56:47,950 --> 03:56:49,550
I knew it was a mistake.

6122
03:56:50,450 --> 03:56:53,310
The game give it and the game take it away.

6123
03:56:56,010 --> 03:56:56,530
Nice.

6124
03:56:57,290 --> 03:56:58,250
Holy shit.

6125
03:56:58,330 --> 03:56:59,870
We like, stuffed that ball.

6126
03:57:04,010 --> 03:57:04,850
That ball.

6127
03:57:05,790 --> 03:57:06,610
That ball.

6128
03:57:07,730 --> 03:57:09,810
That ball needs to be put down.

6129
03:57:10,610 --> 03:57:11,730
In the game.

6130
03:57:17,970 --> 03:57:18,570
He's old.

6131
03:57:18,790 --> 03:57:19,530
He's too old.

6132
03:57:20,930 --> 03:57:21,790
Alright, here you go.

6133
03:57:22,030 --> 03:57:22,470
Ignore ball.

6134
03:57:22,610 --> 03:57:23,010
Fuck him.

6135
03:57:23,490 --> 03:57:25,250
That body ball was really good though.

6136
03:57:25,330 --> 03:57:25,950
Enemy here!

6137
03:57:27,970 --> 03:57:33,170
All I'm saying is that that ball has lived past his life.

6138
03:57:36,450 --> 03:57:38,130
I swear to God.

6139
03:57:39,010 --> 03:57:40,590
Put that rodent down.

6140
03:57:40,710 --> 03:57:41,330
It's a pest.

6141
03:57:45,050 --> 03:57:46,930
Oh my God, he's so low!

6142
03:57:48,570 --> 03:57:49,490
Someone quick!

6143
03:57:49,710 --> 03:57:50,190
I'm on cart.

6144
03:57:50,410 --> 03:57:51,130
Breeze brings relief.

6145
03:57:54,610 --> 03:57:55,410
We literally...

6146
03:57:55,410 --> 03:57:59,170
Okay, honestly, all we need is just a Sombra.

6147
03:57:59,430 --> 03:58:00,870
That's literally all we need.

6148
03:58:01,030 --> 03:58:01,670
I swear.

6149
03:58:05,230 --> 03:58:06,770
Oh, we do have a Sombra!

6150
03:58:07,230 --> 03:58:08,530
I did not even know...

6151
03:58:08,530 --> 03:58:10,070
This is how irrelevant our Sombra was.

6152
03:58:10,230 --> 03:58:11,670
I didn't even know we had a Sombra.

6153
03:58:12,190 --> 03:58:14,530
Guys, our Sombra should not have been pushing the cart.

6154
03:58:17,850 --> 03:58:20,130
Our Sombra should not have been pushing.

6155
03:58:20,130 --> 03:58:23,950
He needs to be out there to get rid of this rodent infestation.

6156
03:58:24,070 --> 03:58:25,230
Our cast is half-exceeded.

6157
03:58:26,910 --> 03:58:27,570
Okay.

6158
03:58:28,190 --> 03:58:28,850
Bye.

6159
03:58:29,910 --> 03:58:30,990
EMP activated.

6160
03:58:31,470 --> 03:58:32,130
EMP?

6161
03:58:32,750 --> 03:58:33,410
Bro!

6162
03:58:34,090 --> 03:58:36,030
You need EMP this guy!

6163
03:58:38,930 --> 03:58:39,590
Bro!

6164
03:58:40,270 --> 03:58:42,710
This guy is the one that needs to be...

6165
03:58:42,710 --> 03:58:43,530
Please, please!

6166
03:58:43,590 --> 03:58:44,250
Move!

6167
03:58:44,810 --> 03:58:45,250
Move!

6168
03:58:45,450 --> 03:58:46,610
Push up!

6169
03:58:46,830 --> 03:58:47,310
Push up!

6170
03:58:48,670 --> 03:58:49,330
Why?

6171
03:58:49,530 --> 03:58:50,110
Oh my God!

6172
03:58:50,110 --> 03:58:52,200
Why did you guys AFK?

6173
03:58:52,770 --> 03:58:54,170
I literally couldn't TP.

6174
03:58:54,670 --> 03:58:57,790
I literally couldn't TP.

6175
03:58:58,730 --> 03:59:00,190
What is this?

6176
03:59:03,230 --> 03:59:04,890
I can't believe it.

6177
03:59:06,310 --> 03:59:08,010
I can't believe it.

6178
03:59:08,150 --> 03:59:10,310
They are all so...

6179
03:59:11,470 --> 03:59:13,490
I can't believe it.

6180
03:59:14,430 --> 03:59:15,390
Watch that.

6181
03:59:15,790 --> 03:59:18,470
I'm going to shake the fake Bastion.

6182
03:59:18,650 --> 03:59:20,090
Someone get rid of that.

6183
03:59:20,090 --> 03:59:20,690
I'm going to get rid of this Hammond.

6184
03:59:20,770 --> 03:59:21,690
That's all I care.

6185
03:59:22,650 --> 03:59:25,030
I'll get the job done with you, Tracer.

6186
03:59:26,550 --> 03:59:26,990
Please.

6187
03:59:27,330 --> 03:59:28,950
This is for you and Kiri up there, Tracer.

6188
03:59:30,170 --> 03:59:30,770
Don't worry.

6189
03:59:31,130 --> 03:59:32,350
Don't worry, BBC News.

6190
03:59:32,470 --> 03:59:33,270
I'm here to help you.

6191
03:59:34,090 --> 03:59:35,470
I'm getting rid of this turret.

6192
03:59:35,690 --> 03:59:36,670
Oh, never mind.

6193
03:59:36,990 --> 03:59:37,830
Helping is over.

6194
03:59:38,550 --> 03:59:38,990
Thanks.

6195
03:59:40,490 --> 03:59:41,390
Oh, thank God.

6196
03:59:42,830 --> 03:59:44,170
Thank fucking God.

6197
03:59:44,790 --> 03:59:46,470
Their Torb is alone on the left.

6198
03:59:48,130 --> 03:59:48,710
Don't worry.

6199
03:59:49,130 --> 03:59:49,570
Wait.

6200
03:59:49,790 --> 03:59:50,010
Wait.

6201
03:59:50,070 --> 03:59:50,390
He's a bug.

6202
03:59:50,430 --> 03:59:51,050
He's a bug.

6203
03:59:51,810 --> 03:59:52,490
He's a bug.

6204
03:59:52,650 --> 03:59:52,710
He's a bug.

6205
03:59:54,470 --> 03:59:55,150
Oh, nice.

6206
03:59:55,310 --> 03:59:55,950
I did it.

6207
03:59:56,570 --> 03:59:57,990
I did not expect this.

6208
03:59:58,110 --> 03:59:59,110
But oh my...

6209
03:59:59,110 --> 03:59:59,510
How?

6210
04:00:00,670 --> 04:00:01,370
Enemy in here.

6211
04:00:02,810 --> 04:00:03,510
There you go.

6212
04:00:03,750 --> 04:00:04,310
We're fine.

6213
04:00:04,990 --> 04:00:05,630
We're fine.

6214
04:00:06,070 --> 04:00:07,170
We are not fine.

6215
04:00:09,330 --> 04:00:10,210
Oh, God.

6216
04:00:10,350 --> 04:00:11,310
Oh, God.

6217
04:00:13,550 --> 04:00:14,950
Get rid of the turrets.

6218
04:00:16,170 --> 04:00:17,750
Please get rid of this.

6219
04:00:18,570 --> 04:00:19,350
Bring no bash?

6220
04:00:19,610 --> 04:00:20,050
No.

6221
04:00:24,750 --> 04:00:26,550
How is the Brig still alive?

6222
04:00:26,990 --> 04:00:28,870
We are very capable of killing Brig here.

6223
04:00:28,990 --> 04:00:29,730
Are we?

6224
04:00:29,930 --> 04:00:30,690
We're not!

6225
04:00:34,350 --> 04:00:36,570
Oh god, I'm not feeling... Oh nice!

6226
04:00:36,790 --> 04:00:37,490
Two kills!

6227
04:00:38,490 --> 04:00:40,090
Please, we just need to get rid of the bot.

6228
04:00:40,210 --> 04:00:41,350
That's all I care about.

6229
04:00:41,770 --> 04:00:46,770
Someone please... just get rid of this one thing in my life.

6230
04:00:49,930 --> 04:00:51,470
I have... I have... Rush!

6231
04:00:52,910 --> 04:00:53,670
Just live!

6232
04:00:57,950 --> 04:00:58,750
Okay, nice.

6233
04:00:59,590 --> 04:01:00,410
Not nice.

6234
04:01:01,770 --> 04:01:02,970
Absolutely not nice.

6235
04:01:05,110 --> 04:01:06,470
Absolutely not good.

6236
04:01:07,410 --> 04:01:08,590
Unless... please.

6237
04:01:08,830 --> 04:01:10,190
Please just kill the bot.

6238
04:01:10,630 --> 04:01:13,710
Please, he's just ring-arounding the Rosie right now.

6239
04:01:15,830 --> 04:01:16,670
I failed.

6240
04:01:16,670 --> 04:01:17,090
I'm begging of you.

6241
04:01:19,090 --> 04:01:20,750
Please, he's still alive!

6242
04:01:20,990 --> 04:01:21,910
We have to kill Brig.

6243
04:01:22,370 --> 04:01:22,970
No!

6244
04:01:27,270 --> 04:01:28,470
I clapped!

6245
04:01:29,170 --> 04:01:30,410
I clapped!

6246
04:01:32,430 --> 04:01:34,150
Guys, I clapped!

6247
04:01:34,610 --> 04:01:35,390
Oh my gosh, he's alive!

6248
04:01:36,290 --> 04:01:37,570
Where's my clap?

6249
04:01:37,910 --> 04:01:38,630
I gotta get off.

6250
04:01:39,450 --> 04:01:40,710
Where's my clap?

6251
04:01:41,070 --> 04:01:42,990
Clap gone.

6252
04:01:43,730 --> 04:01:44,790
Are you gonna win this?

6253
04:01:44,790 --> 04:01:46,730
You're gonna win this.

6254
04:01:47,170 --> 04:01:49,570
Guys, I don't think they're gonna win this, guys.

6255
04:01:49,850 --> 04:01:50,590
We don't want this.

6256
04:01:50,870 --> 04:01:53,570
Bro, we're like... we're super staggered.

6257
04:01:54,810 --> 04:01:55,650
Oh no.

6258
04:01:55,750 --> 04:01:56,250
Oh no.

6259
04:01:56,310 --> 04:01:57,210
Oh no!

6260
04:01:57,390 --> 04:01:58,270
Oh no!

6261
04:01:58,350 --> 04:01:59,470
I'm gonna be staggered too.

6262
04:01:59,650 --> 04:02:01,050
JK, I'm the gamer.

6263
04:02:03,570 --> 04:02:04,050
Alright.

6264
04:02:04,670 --> 04:02:05,370
Here we go.

6265
04:02:08,390 --> 04:02:09,210
This is it.

6266
04:02:11,250 --> 04:02:11,690
Oh.

6267
04:02:12,790 --> 04:02:13,970
It's just not meant to be.

6268
04:02:14,410 --> 04:02:14,990
You know?

6269
04:02:18,150 --> 04:02:20,190
Just not meant to be, you know?

6270
04:02:21,090 --> 04:02:22,750
It's just... just not meant to be.

6271
04:02:24,670 --> 04:02:27,590
I can feel the Tracer looking for it.

6272
04:02:30,990 --> 04:02:32,630
Oh, come on!

6273
04:02:32,630 --> 04:02:33,330
You fucking...

6274
04:02:33,330 --> 04:02:33,850
They're anti.

6275
04:02:34,410 --> 04:02:35,130
That's an anti.

6276
04:02:36,770 --> 04:02:37,250
Goodbye.

6277
04:02:37,410 --> 04:02:38,390
This is where I die.

6278
04:02:38,930 --> 04:02:40,410
It was nice knowing you.

6279
04:02:40,670 --> 04:02:41,270
I got you.

6280
04:02:42,030 --> 04:02:44,110
Wait, you can DM that?!

6281
04:02:44,110 --> 04:02:45,330
That's crazy!

6282
04:02:45,410 --> 04:02:47,370
I didn't even know you can DM that!

6283
04:02:47,830 --> 04:02:49,290
Holy shit!

6284
04:02:49,850 --> 04:02:51,490
Wait, this changes everything!

6285
04:02:53,070 --> 04:02:54,230
Wait, that's actually insane.

6286
04:02:54,450 --> 04:02:55,550
I did not know that.

6287
04:02:56,150 --> 04:02:57,590
I'm getting on Tracer.

6288
04:02:57,730 --> 04:02:58,890
Right side, half HP.

6289
04:03:02,130 --> 04:03:03,110
That's actually insane.

6290
04:03:05,790 --> 04:03:06,390
Okay.

6291
04:03:06,390 --> 04:03:08,230
Please, it's literally Hammond.

6292
04:03:08,390 --> 04:03:08,990
Again.

6293
04:03:10,990 --> 04:03:12,630
It's literally Hammond again.

6294
04:03:14,370 --> 04:03:15,790
Oh my god!

6295
04:03:17,770 --> 04:03:19,390
I got saved!

6296
04:03:19,670 --> 04:03:20,750
My hero!

6297
04:03:22,210 --> 04:03:22,810
Academia.

6298
04:03:27,710 --> 04:03:29,350
I didn't know that!

6299
04:03:30,090 --> 04:03:34,010
Why the fuck did any of the other Divas ever DM me from this?

6300
04:03:38,050 --> 04:03:38,990
Oh my god!

6301
04:03:39,330 --> 04:03:40,270
Okay, I should go.

6302
04:03:40,490 --> 04:03:41,630
I don't think I should go.

6303
04:03:42,070 --> 04:03:44,090
Defense-wise, I don't like going defense.

6304
04:03:44,370 --> 04:03:46,790
Actually, no, I should go Ana for Hammond though.

6305
04:03:47,170 --> 04:03:47,950
For Hammond.

6306
04:03:47,970 --> 04:03:49,650
I really hate playing...

6307
04:03:50,370 --> 04:03:51,970
I hate playing...

6308
04:03:55,370 --> 04:03:57,710
Defensive Ana on this map.

6309
04:03:58,050 --> 04:04:01,390
But because they have a Hammond, I feel like I should... might as well.

6310
04:04:01,550 --> 04:04:02,370
I feel like I should.

6311
04:04:05,450 --> 04:04:06,310
Oh my god!

6312
04:04:06,470 --> 04:04:07,530
My fucking hero!

6313
04:04:08,410 --> 04:04:09,870
Just one more mission.

6314
04:04:10,570 --> 04:04:15,150
Maybe if I put the spray in front of them, they'll get intimidated and stop harassing me.

6315
04:04:15,990 --> 04:04:17,530
I don't think anyone... I didn't know.

6316
04:04:17,690 --> 04:04:20,430
I didn't know you can... I know you can punch deflects now.

6317
04:04:20,990 --> 04:04:23,670
Or unless that was a bug, because I punched a Genji deflect.

6318
04:04:24,670 --> 04:04:26,070
And got the kill.

6319
04:04:28,430 --> 04:04:28,890
Alright.

6320
04:04:29,970 --> 04:04:30,810
There you go.

6321
04:04:35,230 --> 04:04:35,870
Alright.

6322
04:04:36,490 --> 04:04:37,130
Alright.

6323
04:04:37,390 --> 04:04:40,250
We either win this or lose this horribly.

6324
04:04:40,950 --> 04:04:43,030
We'll find out in the next episode.

6325
04:04:43,670 --> 04:04:46,310
Doki has been playing Overwatch for four hours now.

6326
04:04:49,150 --> 04:04:49,790
Whoa.

6327
04:04:50,690 --> 04:04:51,650
Echo ball.

6328
04:04:57,180 --> 04:04:57,820
Please.

6329
04:04:58,700 --> 04:04:59,680
I can't.

6330
04:04:59,900 --> 04:05:01,280
I got knocked over.

6331
04:05:01,380 --> 04:05:02,400
We're so fucked.

6332
04:05:06,000 --> 04:05:07,480
Come on, I fucked up.

6333
04:05:07,820 --> 04:05:10,620
I got knocked off.

6334
04:05:10,960 --> 04:05:12,140
We needed help.

6335
04:05:12,500 --> 04:05:14,860
We all needed help.

6336
04:05:15,200 --> 04:05:16,180
Holy shit.

6337
04:05:20,960 --> 04:05:21,580
I'll get out.

6338
04:05:22,980 --> 04:05:23,840
Will I get out?

6339
04:05:23,980 --> 04:05:24,820
Let's find out.

6340
04:05:24,980 --> 04:05:25,440
I did.

6341
04:05:26,000 --> 04:05:27,160
Wait, are we contesting?

6342
04:05:31,680 --> 04:05:32,600
Oh no.

6343
04:05:35,700 --> 04:05:36,260
Oh.

6344
04:05:36,440 --> 04:05:36,460
Oh.

6345
04:05:36,460 --> 04:05:38,120
Maybe I should have went Kiriko.

6346
04:05:38,300 --> 04:05:39,240
Maybe I should have went Brig.

6347
04:05:39,280 --> 04:05:42,380
But Brig is not that much healing so I was conflicted.

6348
04:05:46,660 --> 04:05:47,360
Oh nice!

6349
04:05:47,440 --> 04:05:47,860
Nice kill!

6350
04:05:47,960 --> 04:05:48,320
Nice kill!

6351
04:05:50,520 --> 04:05:51,120
Ante too!

6352
04:05:52,520 --> 04:05:52,920
Cleanse!

6353
04:05:56,820 --> 04:05:58,300
Trying so hard to keep you up.

6354
04:05:59,540 --> 04:06:00,100
Don't worry.

6355
04:06:00,160 --> 04:06:00,500
The news.

6356
04:06:00,600 --> 04:06:01,320
I've got the news.

6357
04:06:06,460 --> 04:06:07,020
He's at the end.

6358
04:06:07,100 --> 04:06:07,680
He's so low!

6359
04:06:08,360 --> 04:06:08,800
Go!

6360
04:06:09,280 --> 04:06:09,500
Go!

6361
04:06:09,580 --> 04:06:09,780
Go!

6362
04:06:17,630 --> 04:06:18,510
Oh god.

6363
04:06:18,950 --> 04:06:19,610
Oh god.

6364
04:06:22,910 --> 04:06:23,890
Oh my god.

6365
04:06:23,970 --> 04:06:25,670
This is the last...

6366
04:06:28,330 --> 04:06:28,770
Please.

6367
04:06:31,070 --> 04:06:31,510
Please!

6368
04:06:36,720 --> 04:06:37,160
Please!

6369
04:06:41,960 --> 04:06:42,680
Brig!

6370
04:06:42,860 --> 04:06:43,000
Brig!

6371
04:06:43,080 --> 04:06:43,300
Brig!

6372
04:06:43,300 --> 04:06:43,480
Brig!

6373
04:06:43,920 --> 04:06:46,900
Are you fucking kidding me?!

6374
04:06:48,620 --> 04:06:49,720
Oh my god!

6375
04:06:49,940 --> 04:06:50,660
Please!

6376
04:06:51,220 --> 04:06:53,020
I might be dead here...

6377
04:06:54,100 --> 04:06:56,400
I swear to god.

6378
04:06:56,520 --> 04:06:57,460
I can't.

6379
04:06:57,740 --> 04:07:02,380
Oh no!

6380
04:07:02,500 --> 04:07:03,600
This is so risky!

6381
04:07:07,660 --> 04:07:09,640
This is fucking...

6382
04:07:09,640 --> 04:07:10,000
No!

6383
04:07:11,560 --> 04:07:12,040
Please!

6384
04:07:12,260 --> 04:07:14,120
Okay, I can heal from here.

6385
04:07:14,820 --> 04:07:16,280
I can heal from the far.

6386
04:07:16,760 --> 04:07:18,760
As long as he doesn't harass me, we're fine.

6387
04:07:24,420 --> 04:07:24,900
Please.

6388
04:07:25,700 --> 04:07:28,420
The longest fight of our fucking lives.

6389
04:07:33,800 --> 04:07:34,280
Oh!

6390
04:07:38,580 --> 04:07:40,340
Oh my god.

6391
04:07:40,660 --> 04:07:43,040
Get this fucker away from me.

6392
04:07:43,080 --> 04:07:43,600
Get him away!

6393
04:07:47,060 --> 04:07:48,580
Jesus Christ!

6394
04:07:50,140 --> 04:07:51,140
He's won!

6395
04:07:53,020 --> 04:07:54,300
I'm so sad.

6396
04:07:55,080 --> 04:07:57,180
I'm so sad.

6397
04:07:58,020 --> 04:07:59,840
I'm actually so sad.

6398
04:08:01,000 --> 04:08:03,040
I'm so sad.

6399
04:08:08,360 --> 04:08:10,380
I'm so sad.

6400
04:08:10,700 --> 04:08:11,360
I'm so sad.

6401
04:08:11,360 --> 04:08:11,380
I'm so sad.

6402
04:08:11,380 --> 04:08:13,960
This hamster lived for so long.

6403
04:08:16,860 --> 04:08:18,560
We just don't kill the healer.

6404
04:08:22,950 --> 04:08:26,030
I get harassed so much.

6405
04:08:26,150 --> 04:08:28,390
Does the MP just go for the healers?

6406
04:08:29,010 --> 04:08:30,930
Oh my god.

6407
04:08:31,710 --> 04:08:33,230
The amount of times.

6408
04:08:36,430 --> 04:08:36,990
No!

6409
04:08:37,670 --> 04:08:39,190
Call out when you need help.

6410
04:08:39,550 --> 04:08:40,550
What do you got?

6411
04:08:40,830 --> 04:08:41,510
Res, res, res.

6412
04:08:41,950 --> 04:08:42,510
No!

6413
04:08:44,730 --> 04:08:45,290
Guys.

6414
04:08:45,910 --> 04:08:47,590
Guys, I think this is GG's.

6415
04:08:48,750 --> 04:08:49,310
Guys.

6416
04:08:49,870 --> 04:08:51,090
I have a feeling.

6417
04:08:55,530 --> 04:08:57,370
Oh my god.

6418
04:08:57,690 --> 04:08:58,810
I can't.

6419
04:08:58,810 --> 04:09:00,310
I can't out-heal this.

6420
04:09:01,450 --> 04:09:03,850
We're just staggering over and over.

6421
04:09:05,270 --> 04:09:06,010
There's no way.

6422
04:09:06,010 --> 04:09:07,850
No way we can do this in one minute.

6423
04:09:10,170 --> 04:09:11,250
Oh no.

6424
04:09:11,930 --> 04:09:14,110
This guy does not know how Ventral works.

6425
04:09:15,650 --> 04:09:16,230
Okay.

6426
04:09:16,230 --> 04:09:16,870
We gotta go now.

6427
04:09:17,410 --> 04:09:17,990
Okay.

6428
04:09:21,350 --> 04:09:22,850
That's very unfortunate.

6429
04:09:26,630 --> 04:09:27,210
Bro.

6430
04:09:30,910 --> 04:09:31,370
Bro.

6431
04:09:31,570 --> 04:09:34,030
This Tracer needs to get off my deck.

6432
04:09:34,410 --> 04:09:34,990
Bro.

6433
04:09:35,510 --> 04:09:35,850
Bro.

6434
04:09:35,850 --> 04:09:35,990
Bro.

6435
04:09:38,650 --> 04:09:42,150
This Tracer needs to get off my deck.

6436
04:09:45,170 --> 04:09:47,910
Guys, it's over.

6437
04:09:48,090 --> 04:09:49,330
It's so over.

6438
04:09:49,950 --> 04:09:52,230
I never had...

6439
04:09:56,330 --> 04:09:57,070
Please.

6440
04:09:58,090 --> 04:09:58,830
Please.

6441
04:09:58,930 --> 04:10:00,350
For the love of god!

6442
04:10:02,970 --> 04:10:07,130
This has been the most it's so over game ever.

6443
04:10:12,010 --> 04:10:14,630
The struggle is so real.

6444
04:10:18,950 --> 04:10:20,610
Kill ball, right now!

6445
04:10:21,930 --> 04:10:22,990
Oh, don't worry!

6446
04:10:23,190 --> 04:10:23,970
I wish!

6447
04:10:25,050 --> 04:10:29,310
There's no way we pushed it all the way here.

6448
04:10:33,630 --> 04:10:34,490
It's okay.

6449
04:10:34,630 --> 04:10:35,850
It's not okay.

6450
04:10:40,390 --> 04:10:42,910
Oh my god!

6451
04:10:43,310 --> 04:10:44,250
Bro!

6452
04:10:45,370 --> 04:10:48,850
I have 8k damage?!

6453
04:10:48,850 --> 04:10:49,610
Holy sh...

6454
04:10:49,610 --> 04:10:50,730
Guys...

6455
04:10:51,910 --> 04:10:53,610
It's not okay.

6456
04:10:54,010 --> 04:10:56,510
This is not okay.

6457
04:10:59,270 --> 04:11:02,730
Guys... guys, I don't think this is okay.

6458
04:11:10,510 --> 04:11:12,250
Oh my god.

6459
04:11:12,690 --> 04:11:15,110
Maybe... maybe I'll Brig.

6460
04:11:18,550 --> 04:11:19,310
Maybe...

6461
04:11:23,950 --> 04:11:25,770
Maybe this is it.

6462
04:11:26,370 --> 04:11:30,030
Maybe all I need to do is play Brig as well.

6463
04:11:32,950 --> 04:11:35,990
We can use cure... yeah, yeah.

6464
04:11:36,110 --> 04:11:37,330
Up the win rate.

6465
04:11:37,590 --> 04:11:40,250
Yeah, that seems right.

6466
04:11:41,130 --> 04:11:44,570
Guys... guys, maybe it's... if I was Brig?

6467
04:11:44,750 --> 04:11:45,210
Maybe.

6468
04:11:47,170 --> 04:11:51,030
Is Sombra just non-stop hacks the... the...

6469
04:11:51,030 --> 04:11:52,750
I'll try to peel for you more often.

6470
04:11:52,750 --> 04:11:54,130
We have to hold the top.

6471
04:11:59,010 --> 04:12:00,790
Yeah, just play what you're playing.

6472
04:12:01,750 --> 04:12:02,630
This is it.

6473
04:12:03,730 --> 04:12:04,290
Maybe.

6474
04:12:04,990 --> 04:12:06,450
Maybe this is all we do.

6475
04:12:07,530 --> 04:12:09,550
It should be winnable, right?

6476
04:12:14,610 --> 04:12:16,290
If he goes Hammond.

6477
04:12:22,660 --> 04:12:23,580
Oh, sh...

6478
04:12:24,880 --> 04:12:27,100
If we could kill Brig...

6479
04:12:27,100 --> 04:12:28,500
Let's get out of...

6480
04:12:28,500 --> 04:12:30,640
Guys, I don't think it's winnable anymore.

6481
04:12:31,160 --> 04:12:32,800
There's a Brig on me behind, by the way, guys.

6482
04:12:34,480 --> 04:12:35,220
There we go.

6483
04:12:35,300 --> 04:12:36,840
I got... I got him out.

6484
04:12:38,200 --> 04:12:39,080
Where's that Brig?

6485
04:12:42,440 --> 04:12:43,820
Alright, this is it.

6486
04:12:44,460 --> 04:12:45,880
This is not it, guys.

6487
04:12:46,000 --> 04:12:46,660
I think...

6488
04:12:46,660 --> 04:12:46,900
I think...

6489
04:12:46,900 --> 04:12:48,480
I think we know...

6490
04:12:49,200 --> 04:12:50,640
That this is not it.

6491
04:12:53,600 --> 04:12:55,100
Oh my god.

6492
04:12:55,200 --> 04:12:57,220
This is absolutely not it.

6493
04:13:01,770 --> 04:13:03,050
Oh my god.

6494
04:13:03,250 --> 04:13:04,070
I'm leaving.

6495
04:13:04,270 --> 04:13:04,570
Goodbye.

6496
04:13:05,810 --> 04:13:07,290
I'm f**king leaving.

6497
04:13:08,490 --> 04:13:09,350
Oh no.

6498
04:13:13,570 --> 04:13:14,930
Brig on Brig violence!

6499
04:13:15,070 --> 04:13:15,450
Let's go!

6500
04:13:15,930 --> 04:13:17,070
Okay, let's not go.

6501
04:13:17,730 --> 04:13:18,710
Let's not go.

6502
04:13:20,050 --> 04:13:21,790
Let's absolutely not go.

6503
04:13:27,020 --> 04:13:28,660
Guys, it was not it.

6504
04:13:28,900 --> 04:13:30,500
All I'm saying...

6505
04:13:31,460 --> 04:13:33,220
I was not the issue.

6506
04:13:37,080 --> 04:13:39,020
I'm gonna avoid...

6507
04:13:39,020 --> 04:13:43,100
I'm gonna avoid the Mercy because I think the Mercy is a one trick.

6508
04:13:43,600 --> 04:13:45,840
And like... and they don't swap.

6509
04:13:46,080 --> 04:13:48,240
So I'm gonna avoid the Mercy.

6510
04:13:52,120 --> 04:13:54,740
And I'm also gonna avoid...

6511
04:13:54,740 --> 04:13:56,060
Who was the Sombra?

6512
04:13:56,440 --> 04:13:58,440
Who played... this was the Sombra, right?

6513
04:13:58,500 --> 04:14:00,060
I assume these two are duo'd.

6514
04:14:00,740 --> 04:14:01,240
Guys...

6515
04:14:02,260 --> 04:14:02,760
Reversal?

6516
04:14:02,980 --> 04:14:04,860
Are you f**king kidding me?

6517
04:14:06,520 --> 04:14:07,020
Okay.

6518
04:14:08,020 --> 04:14:08,520
Alright.

6519
04:14:08,660 --> 04:14:09,040
Nice.

6520
04:14:09,120 --> 04:14:10,640
Guys, this is where our luck changes.

6521
04:14:10,940 --> 04:14:12,880
We're gonna win five games in a row after that.

6522
04:14:13,020 --> 04:14:16,840
This is exactly where our luck changes.

6523
04:14:21,030 --> 04:14:21,950
This is it.

6524
04:14:26,910 --> 04:14:28,370
This is f**king it.

6525
04:14:28,470 --> 04:14:28,830
Bro.

6526
04:14:29,010 --> 04:14:29,970
Oh my god.

6527
04:14:30,930 --> 04:14:34,070
Remember that kid that was like 1k?

6528
04:14:34,190 --> 04:14:36,150
He actually thought that was serious.

6529
04:14:36,270 --> 04:14:38,730
And he like replied on Twitter.

6530
04:14:38,970 --> 04:14:41,550
Asking for the actual $1000.

6531
04:14:42,070 --> 04:14:44,040
He's like, what the f**k?

6532
04:14:48,170 --> 04:14:48,870
Bro.

6533
04:14:49,670 --> 04:14:54,990
He actually thought we were serious about betting real money.

6534
04:14:59,110 --> 04:15:00,970
He's like pulling up the...

6535
04:15:00,970 --> 04:15:01,770
Oh, we have a fair.

6536
04:15:01,830 --> 04:15:03,610
Pulling up the receipts on my Twitter.

6537
04:15:03,770 --> 04:15:05,990
And was like, bro, where the f**k's the 1k?

6538
04:15:09,630 --> 04:15:10,990
Bro, there's no way.

6539
04:15:11,470 --> 04:15:12,050
Yo, yo, yo.

6540
04:15:12,590 --> 04:15:13,850
How you guys doing?

6541
04:15:13,870 --> 04:15:15,230
And by guys, I mean you.

6542
04:15:15,550 --> 04:15:17,030
Because there's nobody else in VC.

6543
04:15:17,050 --> 04:15:17,790
Holy sh**.

6544
04:15:17,930 --> 04:15:19,490
And I'm so sad about last game.

6545
04:15:19,490 --> 04:15:21,430
And he was like, why did your mods ban me?

6546
04:15:21,430 --> 04:15:23,430
First off, it was a timeout.

6547
04:15:24,130 --> 04:15:24,930
Second off...

6548
04:15:24,930 --> 04:15:25,950
It was...

6549
04:15:25,950 --> 04:15:26,830
I banned.

6550
04:15:33,470 --> 04:15:36,170
Second off, it wasn't the mods.

6551
04:15:42,110 --> 04:15:43,310
This guy.

6552
04:15:43,510 --> 04:15:44,730
Who am I talking to?

6553
04:15:45,130 --> 04:15:46,730
Where is it though?

6554
04:15:47,550 --> 04:15:48,330
Oh, God.

6555
04:15:48,490 --> 04:15:49,930
I'm just gonna res him.

6556
04:15:50,070 --> 04:15:51,270
I res up res Bozeman.

6557
04:15:52,930 --> 04:15:53,530
Okay.

6558
04:15:53,530 --> 04:15:54,530
Whoa.

6559
04:15:55,210 --> 04:15:55,730
Whoa.

6560
04:15:56,390 --> 04:15:58,530
Oh, I f**king messed up my jump.

6561
04:16:00,010 --> 04:16:01,070
Here, I got you.

6562
04:16:01,790 --> 04:16:02,690
I got you.

6563
04:16:03,030 --> 04:16:04,690
I think Ruben is tired now.

6564
04:16:04,830 --> 04:16:05,950
Ruben is not tired.

6565
04:16:05,990 --> 04:16:06,630
You know how I know?

6566
04:16:06,810 --> 04:16:12,570
If you look at Ruben's Twitch bots, he f**king streams 18 plus hours of Overwatch every f**king day.

6567
04:16:12,770 --> 04:16:15,850
So I know for a fact that like he's not done.

6568
04:16:18,310 --> 04:16:23,510
He literally plays Overwatch like 15 to 18 hours a day.

6569
04:16:27,860 --> 04:16:28,460
Yeah.

6570
04:16:28,660 --> 04:16:29,840
Wait, I have ult.

6571
04:16:29,960 --> 04:16:30,900
What the f**k?

6572
04:16:31,000 --> 04:16:31,880
I actually have ult.

6573
04:16:33,880 --> 04:16:34,940
Oh my God.

6574
04:16:36,260 --> 04:16:37,460
Oh my God.

6575
04:16:37,560 --> 04:16:38,020
Finally.

6576
04:16:39,040 --> 04:16:40,120
Holy s**t.

6577
04:16:40,140 --> 04:16:41,240
We've actually made progress.

6578
04:16:43,400 --> 04:16:44,000
Whee!

6579
04:16:45,040 --> 04:16:46,800
The least dedicated.

6580
04:16:47,100 --> 04:16:47,940
That's depressing.

6581
04:16:48,340 --> 04:16:50,140
That's what happens if like...

6582
04:16:50,140 --> 04:16:51,020
If you...

6583
04:16:51,020 --> 04:16:52,020
If you have...

6584
04:16:52,020 --> 04:16:52,900
You're not on variety.

6585
04:16:53,760 --> 04:16:55,100
It's a sad life.

6586
04:16:55,140 --> 04:16:55,240
I don't know.

6587
04:16:55,240 --> 04:16:58,580
I feel like I'm on the path of an only FPS streamer or like only...

6588
04:16:58,580 --> 04:17:00,220
Like a specialty streamer.

6589
04:17:00,720 --> 04:17:02,700
You play the game until it dies.

6590
04:17:03,000 --> 04:17:03,200
Hehehe.

6591
04:17:06,720 --> 04:17:08,240
I don't got you.

6592
04:17:08,540 --> 04:17:10,900
Oh, I don't got you anymore.

6593
04:17:12,240 --> 04:17:12,840
Oh.

6594
04:17:14,420 --> 04:17:15,980
That Pharah, this?

6595
04:17:17,460 --> 04:17:18,060
How?

6596
04:17:19,080 --> 04:17:20,540
Oh, he killed him.

6597
04:17:25,150 --> 04:17:27,450
Guys, I can't wait to get back to the game.

6598
04:17:27,450 --> 04:17:28,970
The game... the SR I lost.

6599
04:17:32,050 --> 04:17:32,910
She's still grinding.

6600
04:17:33,250 --> 04:17:35,970
Not stopping until we fucking hit Masters.

6601
04:17:36,870 --> 04:17:40,530
It's literally... Guys, I've just been targeted, okay?

6602
04:17:41,010 --> 04:17:42,950
I can beat Masters so easily.

6603
04:17:43,010 --> 04:17:44,270
I've just been targeted.

6604
04:17:46,090 --> 04:17:47,110
I swear.

6605
04:17:50,070 --> 04:17:52,450
I can easily get Masters.

6606
04:17:52,950 --> 04:17:56,370
It's just streaming the grind is a lot more difficult.

6607
04:17:57,470 --> 04:17:58,610
They don't care.

6608
04:17:58,890 --> 04:18:00,330
Yeah, yeah.

6609
04:18:01,630 --> 04:18:03,530
It's all stream snipers, guys.

6610
04:18:03,690 --> 04:18:04,690
You wouldn't understand.

6611
04:18:05,750 --> 04:18:07,510
It's just all stream snipers.

6612
04:18:07,570 --> 04:18:09,130
See, that Hog put that trap there?

6613
04:18:09,210 --> 04:18:11,210
To purposely stream snipe me.

6614
04:18:11,410 --> 04:18:14,130
He stream sniped me and then put the trap there.

6615
04:18:14,450 --> 04:18:16,270
Our fucking Pharah is so dead.

6616
04:18:20,590 --> 04:18:21,150
Okay,

6617
04:18:25,790 --> 04:18:26,810
I was not saved.

6618
04:18:27,450 --> 04:18:27,450
Okay.

6619
04:18:27,930 --> 04:18:28,910
I win these.

6620
04:18:33,040 --> 04:18:34,850
We saw your record before stream.

6621
04:18:34,990 --> 04:18:35,750
That's different.

6622
04:18:36,010 --> 04:18:36,930
That's different.

6623
04:18:37,210 --> 04:18:38,630
I gained back though.

6624
04:18:38,710 --> 04:18:39,410
I'm positive.

6625
04:18:39,570 --> 04:18:41,610
I'm a positive win rate on everything else.

6626
04:18:41,710 --> 04:18:44,970
I have a positive win rate on everything else but Kiriko.

6627
04:18:46,650 --> 04:18:47,270
It's different.

6628
04:18:47,270 --> 04:18:51,610
I love having new temperature IQ DPS players on my team.

6629
04:18:52,460 --> 04:18:53,450
Every single game.

6630
04:18:53,490 --> 04:18:54,050
It's my favorite.

6631
04:18:55,020 --> 04:18:56,830
You guys just don't understand.

6632
04:18:59,670 --> 04:19:00,190
I don't know the game.

6633
04:19:00,190 --> 04:19:03,720
Oh my God.

6634
04:19:03,820 --> 04:19:04,740
Oh my God.

6635
04:19:04,800 --> 04:19:05,560
He's following me.

6636
04:19:10,560 --> 04:19:12,140
Never go too high.

6637
04:19:16,000 --> 04:19:17,320
It's high filling these.

6638
04:19:18,560 --> 04:19:19,080
Okay.

6639
04:19:19,180 --> 04:19:19,860
I'm going to wait.

6640
04:19:19,980 --> 04:19:20,380
Alright.

6641
04:19:20,420 --> 04:19:21,560
Because I don't want to get pushed off the map.

6642
04:19:21,880 --> 04:19:22,360
It's fine.

6643
04:19:22,480 --> 04:19:22,780
We're fine.

6644
04:19:23,400 --> 04:19:24,220
It's alright.

6645
04:19:24,220 --> 04:19:24,980
We're so fine.

6646
04:19:26,060 --> 04:19:26,580
See.

6647
04:19:26,860 --> 04:19:27,980
We're so fine.

6648
04:19:31,140 --> 04:19:33,560
Bro, I played Mercy for you Pharah!

6649
04:19:34,820 --> 04:19:38,120
Where the f*** is our... where... oh...

6650
04:19:38,120 --> 04:19:38,800
No!

6651
04:19:39,000 --> 04:19:40,120
Shoot the Pharah!

6652
04:19:41,660 --> 04:19:43,640
Shoot the Pharah so I could have...

6653
04:19:45,340 --> 04:19:47,180
Oh nice, just a Kiriko.

6654
04:19:47,620 --> 04:19:48,780
Oh nice, okay.

6655
04:19:49,060 --> 04:19:49,720
That's good.

6656
04:19:50,860 --> 04:19:52,380
That was a 100.

6657
04:19:52,500 --> 04:19:52,860
Yeah it is!

6658
04:19:53,140 --> 04:19:57,360
It made the hog turn around and try and look for me.

6659
04:19:57,360 --> 04:20:06,380
So it was intentional because the hog turned around, forced a bad positioning, and then let my team push up.

6660
04:20:11,150 --> 04:20:12,590
Camille didn't shoot the Pharah.

6661
04:20:12,710 --> 04:20:14,890
If he shot the Pharah I could have got the RZA.

6662
04:20:16,690 --> 04:20:18,810
Oh no, can I get the RZA?

6663
04:20:20,890 --> 04:20:25,750
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah!

6664
04:20:25,750 --> 04:20:26,430
Woah!

6665
04:20:30,720 --> 04:20:31,900
Go shoot the Pharah!

6666
04:20:31,960 --> 04:20:32,980
Please stop shooting the Pharah!

6667
04:20:33,240 --> 04:20:34,620
Please stop shooting the Pharah!

6668
04:20:36,860 --> 04:20:37,940
It's fine, it's fine!

6669
04:20:38,020 --> 04:20:38,600
The Hanzo alive!

6670
04:20:39,400 --> 04:20:40,420
Keep Hanzo alive!

6671
04:20:42,300 --> 04:20:42,780
Nice!

6672
04:20:42,800 --> 04:20:44,380
See, I told you everything's fine!

6673
04:20:46,760 --> 04:20:49,380
I got back the SR I lost last game!

6674
04:20:50,180 --> 04:20:50,660
Yay!

6675
04:20:55,400 --> 04:20:56,080
There we go.

6676
04:20:56,080 --> 04:20:57,580
We're doing it!

6677
04:20:57,620 --> 04:20:57,960
We're fine!

6678
04:20:59,960 --> 04:21:01,820
Doki, when will you stop playing Overwatch?

6679
04:21:03,020 --> 04:21:03,620
Stop?

6680
04:21:11,300 --> 04:21:12,760
When's stream gonna end?

6681
04:21:12,960 --> 04:21:13,480
End?

6682
04:21:20,980 --> 04:21:23,320
You're never getting off this wild ride!

6683
04:21:26,340 --> 04:21:27,320
Look at that.

6684
04:21:27,440 --> 04:21:28,940
Peak Mercy gameplay.

6685
04:21:30,780 --> 04:21:31,480
Woooo!

6686
04:21:33,100 --> 04:21:35,420
E-e-e-end?

6687
04:21:36,640 --> 04:21:38,660
How does one stop?

6688
04:21:39,180 --> 04:21:45,020
Look, all I'm saying is that if I wasn't streaming my gameplay, we would have been masters.

6689
04:21:45,020 --> 04:21:46,820
We would have been like masters too!

6690
04:21:47,180 --> 04:21:48,020
Alright guys?

6691
04:21:48,280 --> 04:21:50,260
I'm not coping, it's the truth.

6692
04:21:50,820 --> 04:21:52,900
It's 100% the truth.

6693
04:21:53,120 --> 04:21:53,980
I'm not coping.

6694
04:21:59,300 --> 04:22:03,480
It's because, you know, I have to entertain and I have to...

6695
04:22:03,480 --> 04:22:05,100
Oh my god!

6696
04:22:05,360 --> 04:22:06,720
That's fucked up!

6697
04:22:07,240 --> 04:22:07,420
Oh!

6698
04:22:11,560 --> 04:22:13,740
I've never seen a more res-able res.

6699
04:22:13,880 --> 04:22:14,580
Oh my god!

6700
04:22:14,580 --> 04:22:15,300
There you go.

6701
04:22:15,440 --> 04:22:15,900
I got it.

6702
04:22:16,260 --> 04:22:17,380
I got the heals.

6703
04:22:18,240 --> 04:22:19,100
Going down?

6704
04:22:19,640 --> 04:22:19,920
Yeah.

6705
04:22:20,020 --> 04:22:24,980
Guys, I have to read and you know reading... you know reading is not my strong suit.

6706
04:22:24,980 --> 04:22:28,540
Now imagine reading and playing the game at the...

6707
04:22:28,540 --> 04:22:28,720
No!

6708
04:22:29,300 --> 04:22:30,000
No!

6709
04:22:30,920 --> 04:22:32,440
You deserve this.

6710
04:22:32,720 --> 04:22:34,640
Oh no.

6711
04:22:34,940 --> 04:22:37,220
Oh no, our Kiriko died for her sins.

6712
04:22:38,740 --> 04:22:39,980
I don't think I was fair.

6713
04:22:40,120 --> 04:22:41,400
Can I fairly do this?

6714
04:22:42,360 --> 04:22:43,680
Will you get hooked?

6715
04:22:44,700 --> 04:22:46,000
Oh, oh, oh.

6716
04:22:46,600 --> 04:22:47,920
Oh, oh, oh.

6717
04:22:48,080 --> 04:22:48,780
Hahaha!

6718
04:22:49,880 --> 04:22:50,420
Hahaha!

6719
04:22:51,260 --> 04:22:54,960
The Mercy body block right there.

6720
04:22:58,530 --> 04:23:02,210
Yeah, also I'm playing Mercy, which I don't know if you guys know this, requires a very high skill ceiling.

6721
04:23:04,570 --> 04:23:05,870
I don't know if you guys know that.

6722
04:23:08,510 --> 04:23:08,870
Yeah!

6723
04:23:08,870 --> 04:23:10,250
We're back where we started!

6724
04:23:10,930 --> 04:23:12,170
Guys, we can do this.

6725
04:23:12,310 --> 04:23:16,050
We really need to win three games in a row.

6726
04:23:16,730 --> 04:23:19,030
Guys, three, three games... This is it.

6727
04:23:19,050 --> 04:23:20,250
This is where the win streak starts.

6728
04:23:20,730 --> 04:23:22,590
We're starting the win streak right here.

6729
04:23:23,310 --> 04:23:23,990
Right now.

6730
04:23:23,990 --> 04:23:26,870
Also, let me make my tweet for my waiting room.

6731
04:23:27,150 --> 04:23:27,570
Hahaha!

6732
04:23:32,330 --> 04:23:34,390
Let me... Let me...

6733
04:23:36,110 --> 04:23:36,550
Okay.

6734
04:23:36,550 --> 04:23:37,410
Alright, here we go.

6735
04:23:37,530 --> 04:23:39,530
I need to make my waiting... Oh shit, we're in game.

6736
04:23:41,230 --> 04:23:42,210
Alright, let's see.

6737
04:23:42,490 --> 04:23:46,710
Okay, this guy was top 500 in Overwatch 1, Season 1.

6738
04:23:47,410 --> 04:23:48,650
Damn, he's washed as hell.

6739
04:23:49,410 --> 04:23:50,290
Alright, Junkertown.

6740
04:23:51,870 --> 04:23:52,630
This is it.

6741
04:23:55,850 --> 04:23:58,550
Alright, now... Now I make my waiting room tweet.

6742
04:23:58,950 --> 04:23:59,630
Don't worry.

6743
04:24:01,690 --> 04:24:03,690
I did not expect to stream this long today.

6744
04:24:04,950 --> 04:24:09,290
I... I get into these phases in gaming where...

6745
04:24:10,450 --> 04:24:14,010
I suddenly just... I just can't stop playing.

6746
04:24:18,110 --> 04:24:22,710
Overwatch is like my biggest problem when it comes to that.

6747
04:24:24,190 --> 04:24:28,390
It's like when I get into like a stride, it's just so hard to stop.

6748
04:24:29,510 --> 04:24:32,330
It's just so fucking hard to stop when it comes to Overwatch.

6749
04:24:34,830 --> 04:24:36,390
Yo, yo, yo!

6750
04:24:38,530 --> 04:24:39,890
It's called addiction.

6751
04:24:40,610 --> 04:24:42,770
The Marvel Arrival is waiting room.

6752
04:24:43,290 --> 04:24:43,810
Hahaha!

6753
04:24:48,150 --> 04:24:49,050
Let's see.

6754
04:24:50,770 --> 04:24:51,770
Alright, here we go.

6755
04:24:52,370 --> 04:24:55,310
No Ana, no Ana, no...

6756
04:24:55,650 --> 04:24:56,090
Is that a Weedle?

6757
04:24:56,310 --> 04:24:57,410
They are running Widow?

6758
04:24:57,530 --> 04:24:57,910
Yeah.

6759
04:24:58,330 --> 04:25:00,250
I saw her crouch there.

6760
04:25:03,710 --> 04:25:04,830
No Weedle.

6761
04:25:10,360 --> 04:25:11,000
Ohoho!

6762
04:25:11,500 --> 04:25:12,140
Ohohoho!

6763
04:25:13,600 --> 04:25:14,240
Ohohoho!

6764
04:25:16,160 --> 04:25:16,800
Hahaha!

6765
04:25:22,960 --> 04:25:24,660
Okay, I have to play Kiriko.

6766
04:25:25,020 --> 04:25:26,460
Because they run...

6767
04:25:26,460 --> 04:25:27,660
God damn it!

6768
04:25:27,660 --> 04:25:29,020
They are running Ana murky.

6769
04:25:29,280 --> 04:25:30,660
So I have to play...

6770
04:25:31,580 --> 04:25:34,140
Do you guys see that fucking Widow right there?

6771
04:25:34,280 --> 04:25:34,660
Hahaha!

6772
04:25:35,160 --> 04:25:35,760
Fear.

6773
04:25:37,340 --> 04:25:38,700
Oh my God!

6774
04:25:40,980 --> 04:25:42,480
That's fucking right.

6775
04:25:44,500 --> 04:25:45,100
No!

6776
04:25:45,500 --> 04:25:46,560
Who woke him up?

6777
04:25:46,600 --> 04:25:47,440
Who peppered her?

6778
04:25:49,540 --> 04:25:51,140
That's way too fast.

6779
04:25:51,920 --> 04:25:52,520
Okay.

6780
04:25:52,660 --> 04:25:54,560
I think I can build Nano here.

6781
04:25:58,650 --> 04:25:59,250
Okay.

6782
04:25:59,250 --> 04:25:59,630
That'll be fine.

6783
04:26:01,050 --> 04:26:02,030
He's just got hook.

6784
04:26:02,210 --> 04:26:02,790
How about Ruben?

6785
04:26:02,870 --> 04:26:03,910
I know you can hook.

6786
04:26:04,290 --> 04:26:06,910
I know you can get that one hook that we need.

6787
04:26:08,050 --> 04:26:08,530
Okay.

6788
04:26:08,770 --> 04:26:11,830
I thought he would, you know, pull him to me.

6789
04:26:12,070 --> 04:26:13,070
But that's okay.

6790
04:26:15,030 --> 04:26:15,990
Oh shit!

6791
04:26:16,390 --> 04:26:16,710
Alright.

6792
04:26:18,430 --> 04:26:19,630
Alright, it's Kiriko time.

6793
04:26:21,150 --> 04:26:23,270
We are not building our Nano.

6794
04:26:25,930 --> 04:26:28,450
We are not gonna be building our Nano.

6795
04:26:28,690 --> 04:26:28,830
Oh shit!

6796
04:26:28,830 --> 04:26:28,850
Oh shit!

6797
04:26:31,910 --> 04:26:32,430
Okay.

6798
04:26:32,530 --> 04:26:35,430
Remember when I say when our win starts now?

6799
04:26:36,090 --> 04:26:38,430
I think maybe next game.

6800
04:26:38,650 --> 04:26:40,690
Alright, when she starts the next game.

6801
04:26:41,310 --> 04:26:42,890
I'm gonna hook him out of the high noon.

6802
04:26:44,650 --> 04:26:45,170
Oh!

6803
04:26:45,690 --> 04:26:46,570
That Mercy!

6804
04:26:47,290 --> 04:26:50,430
That Mercy successfully meat shielded the high noon.

6805
04:26:50,490 --> 04:26:51,270
Holy shit!

6806
04:26:52,450 --> 04:26:52,970
Okay.

6807
04:26:53,030 --> 04:26:53,850
That was really good.

6808
04:26:53,890 --> 04:26:54,410
Not gonna lie.

6809
04:26:54,630 --> 04:26:56,610
That was a really good hook.

6810
04:26:57,730 --> 04:26:58,770
Good accident.

6811
04:26:58,770 --> 04:26:59,330
That didn't hook too.

6812
04:26:59,790 --> 04:27:01,590
Can someone please kill that Widow?

6813
04:27:01,950 --> 04:27:03,050
I'm so scared.

6814
04:27:03,290 --> 04:27:03,770
No!

6815
04:27:04,070 --> 04:27:04,790
He's so low!

6816
04:27:05,090 --> 04:27:06,010
He's so low!

6817
04:27:06,390 --> 04:27:07,290
He's so low!

6818
04:27:08,630 --> 04:27:09,150
Please!

6819
04:27:10,150 --> 04:27:11,350
We got the Widow?

6820
04:27:11,490 --> 04:27:12,350
Nice, we got the Widow.

6821
04:27:15,590 --> 04:27:16,710
We got the Widow.

6822
04:27:18,110 --> 04:27:18,630
Watch.

6823
04:27:22,590 --> 04:27:23,110
Okay.

6824
04:27:23,190 --> 04:27:24,210
I got hit though.

6825
04:27:25,930 --> 04:27:26,930
I got a hit.

6826
04:27:27,270 --> 04:27:27,790
Awesome!

6827
04:27:28,850 --> 04:27:31,590
I got a headshot like that?!

6828
04:27:31,590 --> 04:27:32,930
That's fine.

6829
04:27:33,730 --> 04:27:35,150
It's not fine.

6830
04:27:38,870 --> 04:27:41,630
It was definitely not fine.

6831
04:27:43,530 --> 04:27:45,110
He's not gonna hook me.

6832
04:27:45,490 --> 04:27:46,950
It's so far away.

6833
04:27:55,190 --> 04:27:59,890
Okay, the fucking stomp stomp stomp was a little scary, not gonna lie.

6834
04:28:00,270 --> 04:28:02,670
It was scary.

6835
04:28:02,930 --> 04:28:03,810
It was like a horror film.

6836
04:28:05,470 --> 04:28:05,990
Scared.

6837
04:28:07,890 --> 04:28:09,390
Oh nice, we got the Weedle.

6838
04:28:10,350 --> 04:28:11,330
We're gonna Wes!

6839
04:28:15,750 --> 04:28:16,270
What?!

6840
04:28:16,270 --> 04:28:18,110
Not gonna peek that!

6841
04:28:21,870 --> 04:28:22,990
Can't fucking...

6842
04:28:22,990 --> 04:28:23,230
Ooh.

6843
04:28:27,390 --> 04:28:28,470
There is the Weedle.

6844
04:28:31,330 --> 04:28:32,970
Their Ana is really low bottom left.

6845
04:28:33,110 --> 04:28:34,650
Okay, that's good to know.

6846
04:28:36,050 --> 04:28:37,730
Oh, that's not good to know!

6847
04:28:40,110 --> 04:28:41,690
That's not good to know!

6848
04:28:43,190 --> 04:28:44,950
I feel all worn inside.

6849
04:28:48,150 --> 04:28:49,230
Wait, they Ana!

6850
04:28:49,410 --> 04:28:50,110
Mercy ult!

6851
04:28:50,170 --> 04:28:50,710
Mercy ult!

6852
04:28:50,930 --> 04:28:51,650
That's good!

6853
04:28:51,710 --> 04:28:52,030
That's good!

6854
04:28:52,070 --> 04:28:52,310
No!

6855
04:28:54,290 --> 04:28:55,030
I'm okay.

6856
04:28:59,730 --> 04:29:00,290
Fear.

6857
04:29:04,450 --> 04:29:07,290
Every time I hear those, stomp stomp.

6858
04:29:07,950 --> 04:29:08,510
Fear.

6859
04:29:10,730 --> 04:29:11,990
No no no no!

6860
04:29:12,930 --> 04:29:14,750
I just got it too!

6861
04:29:15,870 --> 04:29:17,930
Oh, he's not Weedle anymore, thank god.

6862
04:29:19,890 --> 04:29:21,510
I can't believe... Me too.

6863
04:29:21,770 --> 04:29:23,270
I can't believe I lived through that.

6864
04:29:24,090 --> 04:29:25,590
This Ana is really good though.

6865
04:29:28,690 --> 04:29:29,170
Okay.

6866
04:29:31,150 --> 04:29:31,630
Wait.

6867
04:29:33,150 --> 04:29:33,630
Nope.

6868
04:29:34,330 --> 04:29:34,810
Missed.

6869
04:29:36,030 --> 04:29:38,090
Andregas, thank you for the five gifts and chips!

6870
04:29:38,130 --> 04:29:38,350
Thank you!

6871
04:29:38,950 --> 04:29:40,410
I appreciate it!

6872
04:29:41,290 --> 04:29:42,210
Okay, bye.

6873
04:29:44,170 --> 04:29:44,650
Thank you!

6874
04:29:44,650 --> 04:29:45,150
Now if i get the...

6875
04:29:45,150 --> 04:29:45,570
Please.

6876
04:29:45,570 --> 04:29:46,050
Please no.

6877
04:29:46,190 --> 04:29:49,130
vorher Nice, nice, nice.

6878
04:29:49,270 --> 04:29:49,730
We don't care.

6879
04:29:49,850 --> 04:29:51,330
There's no Weedo so it's okay.

6880
04:29:51,610 --> 04:29:52,470
Oh no...

6881
04:29:53,410 --> 04:29:54,190
Oh no.

6882
04:29:58,150 --> 04:29:58,990
Where are you?

6883
04:29:59,530 --> 04:30:01,090
I'm gonna stay up here, high ground.

6884
04:30:01,850 --> 04:30:02,970
Hog's coming over though.

6885
04:30:04,890 --> 04:30:05,670
Let's look at Soldier.

6886
04:30:05,830 --> 04:30:06,410
You and I!

6887
04:30:06,550 --> 04:30:07,970
You and I, we work together!

6888
04:30:09,850 --> 04:30:10,850
I'll keep you alive!

6889
04:30:11,630 --> 04:30:12,810
You and I, Soldier!

6890
04:30:14,230 --> 04:30:14,670
See?

6891
04:30:15,190 --> 04:30:15,630
Boom!

6892
04:30:16,230 --> 04:30:16,890
You're alive!

6893
04:30:18,070 --> 04:30:18,510
Magic!

6894
04:30:23,370 --> 04:30:25,590
Oh, that is a very good hook.

6895
04:30:29,150 --> 04:30:30,430
Wait, what?

6896
04:30:30,730 --> 04:30:32,830
I hear somebody behind us.

6897
04:30:32,970 --> 04:30:34,150
Oh, there he is.

6898
04:30:36,390 --> 04:30:37,930
Saving cleanse for antis.

6899
04:30:39,930 --> 04:30:40,570
No!

6900
04:30:40,930 --> 04:30:41,370
Oh!

6901
04:30:42,530 --> 04:30:43,390
You're fine!

6902
04:30:45,990 --> 04:30:46,890
You're okay!

6903
04:30:48,610 --> 04:30:49,170
Look at that.

6904
04:30:50,010 --> 04:30:51,070
I'm getting involved.

6905
04:30:51,350 --> 04:30:52,250
I'm pushing up too.

6906
04:30:53,130 --> 04:30:53,950
He'll be fine.

6907
04:30:54,830 --> 04:30:58,050
He has the Doughkeeper with a negative win rate on Kiriko.

6908
04:30:58,290 --> 04:30:59,210
He'll be fine.

6909
04:31:03,070 --> 04:31:05,250
What's the worst that could happen?

6910
04:31:16,180 --> 04:31:20,590
I can't save like... I can't save a bomb.

6911
04:31:21,430 --> 04:31:23,290
Like, he fucking exploded.

6912
04:31:26,670 --> 04:31:30,010
That's like a fucking nuclear fucking bomb right there.

6913
04:31:30,230 --> 04:31:32,610
Basically brought on the next fallout.

6914
04:31:35,490 --> 04:31:36,790
Oh, he was low though.

6915
04:31:37,450 --> 04:31:38,790
That's what happens.

6916
04:31:41,030 --> 04:31:43,390
Okay, he's giving me ult charge.

6917
04:31:43,910 --> 04:31:44,710
It's okay.

6918
04:31:45,270 --> 04:31:46,570
I love ult charge.

6919
04:31:49,530 --> 04:31:50,050
Got it.

6920
04:31:53,510 --> 04:31:54,310
Oh, he's so low!

6921
04:31:54,370 --> 04:31:54,710
He's so low!

6922
04:31:55,410 --> 04:31:56,110
He's so low!

6923
04:31:59,750 --> 04:32:00,550
And he missed!

6924
04:32:00,870 --> 04:32:01,270
Oh!

6925
04:32:02,470 --> 04:32:04,150
There's no way you can die from this.

6926
04:32:04,310 --> 04:32:05,230
There's no way!

6927
04:32:05,250 --> 04:32:06,530
You're getting pocketed so hard!

6928
04:32:08,010 --> 04:32:08,670
I'm leaving!

6929
04:32:10,810 --> 04:32:12,330
If you die, you die!

6930
04:32:12,970 --> 04:32:13,930
Thanks for the catch up!

6931
04:32:15,950 --> 04:32:18,210
Can we put Mercy doing that over there?

6932
04:32:18,810 --> 04:32:19,250
Where?

6933
04:32:20,070 --> 04:32:20,710
Oh, there.

6934
04:32:23,450 --> 04:32:26,130
I mean, I'm fucking trying my best here.

6935
04:32:29,090 --> 04:32:30,570
Oh, I guess I'll leave.

6936
04:32:30,950 --> 04:32:31,570
Oh, wait!

6937
04:32:31,610 --> 04:32:32,350
This is the last fight!

6938
04:32:32,550 --> 04:32:32,950
No!

6939
04:32:34,530 --> 04:32:35,870
This was the last fight!

6940
04:32:38,250 --> 04:32:38,690
Okay.

6941
04:32:41,150 --> 04:32:43,310
Guys, why did no one tell me it was the last fight?

6942
04:32:45,290 --> 04:32:47,330
Guys, nobody said anything.

6943
04:32:50,190 --> 04:32:51,270
Wait, did we touch it?

6944
04:32:51,430 --> 04:32:52,510
Guys, did we touch it?

6945
04:32:54,930 --> 04:32:57,190
Did we touch it?

6946
04:33:00,230 --> 04:33:04,530
Leaving in the last... How was I supposed to know it was the last fight?

6947
04:33:06,370 --> 04:33:06,930
How?

6948
04:33:10,430 --> 04:33:12,610
Why did no one tell me?

6949
04:33:14,010 --> 04:33:15,150
Guys, I can't remember.

6950
04:33:15,450 --> 04:33:18,290
Anyway, I need to do my... I need to do my waiting room.

6951
04:33:18,570 --> 04:33:20,790
Okay, goodnight, dragons.

6952
04:33:24,790 --> 04:33:27,630
Okay, the waiting room is here!

6953
04:33:29,570 --> 04:33:31,050
I sure...

6954
04:33:32,790 --> 04:33:36,170
Time for some post-Overwatch...

6955
04:33:37,130 --> 04:33:39,410
Overwatch last game...

6956
04:33:39,930 --> 04:33:41,950
Last game...

6957
04:33:41,950 --> 04:33:43,610
Uh... Stress...

6958
04:33:44,390 --> 04:33:44,790
Relief...

6959
04:33:47,230 --> 04:33:54,750
Time for some post-Overwatch relaxing time because I totally got Masters back.

6960
04:33:55,130 --> 04:33:55,550
There we go.

6961
04:33:56,550 --> 04:33:57,170
There we go.

6962
04:33:57,210 --> 04:33:57,830
I did it.

6963
04:33:57,970 --> 04:33:59,350
Is this a wait waiting room?

6964
04:34:00,010 --> 04:34:01,050
How many seconds do I have?

6965
04:34:01,130 --> 04:34:01,530
20 seconds.

6966
04:34:01,610 --> 04:34:02,650
I can get there in 20 seconds!

6967
04:34:03,010 --> 04:34:03,590
There we go.

6968
04:34:05,210 --> 04:34:05,610
Alright.

6969
04:34:08,070 --> 04:34:09,790
I can get there in 20 seconds.

6970
04:34:10,230 --> 04:34:10,630
See?

6971
04:34:10,630 --> 04:34:10,710
See?

6972
04:34:13,170 --> 04:34:14,570
Mercy... Was he always Mercy?

6973
04:34:18,350 --> 04:34:19,910
Oh no, she was like Mora.

6974
04:34:22,090 --> 04:34:22,630
Okay.

6975
04:34:24,690 --> 04:34:25,970
Why damage boost me?

6976
04:34:26,070 --> 04:34:26,690
I'm fucking...

6977
04:34:27,250 --> 04:34:29,010
Oh my god.

6978
04:34:29,330 --> 04:34:30,530
Oh, that's...

6979
04:34:32,290 --> 04:34:32,950
That's okay.

6980
04:34:33,210 --> 04:34:34,390
We just regrouped.

6981
04:34:35,110 --> 04:34:35,650
Okay.

6982
04:34:36,470 --> 04:34:38,710
Um... This is looking positive already.

6983
04:34:41,010 --> 04:34:43,250
It's looking okey-dokey right here.

6984
04:34:44,630 --> 04:34:46,790
Very okey-dokey right here.

6985
04:34:48,750 --> 04:34:49,290
Okay.

6986
04:34:52,830 --> 04:34:53,710
Very fine.

6987
04:34:53,850 --> 04:34:55,050
I feel so healthy.

6988
04:34:57,150 --> 04:34:58,890
I feel so very healthy.

6989
04:35:03,910 --> 04:35:05,750
Bro, the Ana's just there by himself!

6990
04:35:06,210 --> 04:35:06,230
Guys!

6991
04:35:07,470 --> 04:35:08,950
I think I made an error.

6992
04:35:09,270 --> 04:35:10,270
No, you didn't!

6993
04:35:10,750 --> 04:35:11,850
No, you didn't!

6994
04:35:12,030 --> 04:35:12,750
Just kidding.

6995
04:35:12,870 --> 04:35:13,470
I don't make any mistakes.

6996
04:35:13,470 --> 04:35:14,210
No, you didn't!

6997
04:35:14,210 --> 04:35:14,970
You don't die!

6998
04:35:15,530 --> 04:35:15,950
Those!

6999
04:35:20,210 --> 04:35:21,190
Where is this?

7000
04:35:22,330 --> 04:35:23,450
Where is this Weedo?

7001
04:35:23,670 --> 04:35:24,310
Oh, okay.

7002
04:35:24,390 --> 04:35:24,950
Wait a minute.

7003
04:35:25,910 --> 04:35:26,430
Ohog.

7004
04:35:26,430 --> 04:35:26,950
Ohog.

7005
04:35:27,610 --> 04:35:28,130
Ohog.

7006
04:35:28,150 --> 04:35:28,550
Hi, Skippy.

7007
04:35:28,630 --> 04:35:29,110
Don't worry.

7008
04:35:29,390 --> 04:35:29,770
Okay.

7009
04:35:29,870 --> 04:35:30,330
We're fine.

7010
04:35:32,010 --> 04:35:33,150
She hits those.

7011
04:35:33,270 --> 04:35:33,690
That's right.

7012
04:35:33,730 --> 04:35:34,250
She is me.

7013
04:35:35,430 --> 04:35:36,670
Never peeking again.

7014
04:35:36,970 --> 04:35:37,350
Never...

7015
04:35:37,350 --> 04:35:37,670
Waaah!

7016
04:35:39,510 --> 04:35:40,790
Never peeking again!

7017
04:35:44,970 --> 04:35:46,190
Just don't peek.

7018
04:35:49,210 --> 04:35:50,330
She is me.

7019
04:35:50,850 --> 04:35:51,950
I is her.

7020
04:35:53,210 --> 04:35:54,010
There you go.

7021
04:35:54,150 --> 04:35:54,970
Thank you!

7022
04:35:55,110 --> 04:35:57,170
This is exactly why I went Kiriko.

7023
04:35:57,410 --> 04:35:58,290
Oh, no.

7024
04:36:01,150 --> 04:36:01,710
Oh!

7025
04:36:01,970 --> 04:36:02,530
Oh!

7026
04:36:02,590 --> 04:36:03,650
Please don't get headshot!

7027
04:36:03,750 --> 04:36:04,670
Please don't get headshot!

7028
04:36:04,970 --> 04:36:06,250
Please don't get headshot!

7029
04:36:08,430 --> 04:36:08,990
Oh!

7030
04:36:09,230 --> 04:36:09,790
Well...

7031
04:36:09,790 --> 04:36:10,770
Oh!

7032
04:36:10,770 --> 04:36:10,770
Well...

7033
04:36:10,790 --> 04:36:13,050
Please both my teammates don't get headshot.

7034
04:36:13,430 --> 04:36:14,290
That's all I want.

7035
04:36:14,810 --> 04:36:15,630
Oh, no.

7036
04:36:18,030 --> 04:36:18,790
No!

7037
04:36:20,630 --> 04:36:22,330
Yeah, I'm one too.

7038
04:36:26,510 --> 04:36:29,630
Why is everybody peeking the Widow?

7039
04:36:30,650 --> 04:36:31,710
I was okay!

7040
04:36:35,430 --> 04:36:36,830
Oh my god.

7041
04:36:37,010 --> 04:36:37,770
Bro!

7042
04:36:38,050 --> 04:36:39,510
You're not him!

7043
04:36:41,630 --> 04:36:42,710
Thank you.

7044
04:36:43,150 --> 04:36:43,890
All right.

7045
04:36:44,070 --> 04:36:45,230
I will...

7046
04:36:48,450 --> 04:36:49,330
That's right.

7047
04:36:49,650 --> 04:36:51,030
You're not him!

7048
04:36:52,230 --> 04:36:53,110
Swap!

7049
04:36:53,210 --> 04:36:54,090
Play Gangu!

7050
04:36:57,860 --> 04:36:59,440
You'll never beat him!

7051
04:37:00,160 --> 04:37:02,240
Let's hope somebody goes down there.

7052
04:37:04,060 --> 04:37:06,020
Oh my god!

7053
04:37:06,160 --> 04:37:07,260
That's sad.

7054
04:37:09,300 --> 04:37:10,620
That's sad.

7055
04:37:10,800 --> 04:37:11,320
That's sad.

7056
04:37:11,360 --> 04:37:12,240
Oh, no.

7057
04:37:12,240 --> 04:37:14,300
That's so sad.

7058
04:37:17,840 --> 04:37:19,300
That's so sad.

7059
04:37:24,020 --> 04:37:26,160
Please, somebody save me.

7060
04:37:32,240 --> 04:37:34,300
We can recontest this.

7061
04:37:34,360 --> 04:37:34,960
Oh my god.

7062
04:37:35,400 --> 04:37:36,900
I might be a liar.

7063
04:37:38,100 --> 04:37:38,500
Yes.

7064
04:37:38,580 --> 04:37:39,380
I'm definitely a liar.

7065
04:37:39,380 --> 04:37:41,940
The win streak starts next game.

7066
04:37:42,380 --> 04:37:43,460
I swear.

7067
04:37:46,360 --> 04:37:49,260
The win streak will start next game.

7068
04:37:49,920 --> 04:37:52,400
Because I don't think this game is it.

7069
04:37:53,640 --> 04:37:54,880
I know.

7070
04:37:56,500 --> 04:37:57,720
Can we kill Hog?

7071
04:37:57,880 --> 04:37:58,440
No.

7072
04:37:58,620 --> 04:37:59,480
I don't know.

7073
04:37:59,520 --> 04:38:00,180
Can we?

7074
04:38:00,520 --> 04:38:02,980
No one can hide from my sight.

7075
04:38:02,980 --> 04:38:03,640
Thanks for the boost.

7076
04:38:05,660 --> 04:38:06,300
Whoa.

7077
04:38:06,580 --> 04:38:07,220
Whoa.

7078
04:38:07,380 --> 04:38:08,020
Whoa.

7079
04:38:08,020 --> 04:38:08,540
Whoa.

7080
04:38:09,420 --> 04:38:10,520
I'm so sad.

7081
04:38:10,900 --> 04:38:12,000
Oh my god!

7082
04:38:12,020 --> 04:38:15,140
The very first Widow kill we've ever got!

7083
04:38:16,300 --> 04:38:16,860
Oh.

7084
04:38:16,960 --> 04:38:17,260
Okay.

7085
04:38:17,320 --> 04:38:17,880
He went up.

7086
04:38:18,320 --> 04:38:19,600
That's actually crazy.

7087
04:38:19,880 --> 04:38:20,640
We did it, guys.

7088
04:38:21,180 --> 04:38:21,740
Congratulations.

7089
04:38:22,620 --> 04:38:23,940
We did the bare minimum.

7090
04:38:28,270 --> 04:38:30,110
We actually did the bare minimum.

7091
04:38:30,290 --> 04:38:31,610
I'm so proud of you all.

7092
04:38:33,630 --> 04:38:34,190
Ow!

7093
04:38:35,010 --> 04:38:35,570
Missed.

7094
04:38:41,210 --> 04:38:42,590
Give me all charge.

7095
04:38:43,590 --> 04:38:46,230
Give me all charge.

7096
04:38:46,750 --> 04:38:47,630
Their Kass is one.

7097
04:38:48,030 --> 04:38:48,870
Oh, nice.

7098
04:38:49,130 --> 04:38:49,650
Whoa.

7099
04:38:50,270 --> 04:38:50,790
Okay.

7100
04:38:53,170 --> 04:38:54,230
Can we kill Hog?

7101
04:38:55,410 --> 04:38:55,930
Okay.

7102
04:38:59,290 --> 04:38:59,810
Okay.

7103
04:39:01,230 --> 04:39:01,750
Okay.

7104
04:39:03,370 --> 04:39:05,170
Oh, I'm pretty sure.

7105
04:39:07,910 --> 04:39:10,370
I'm pretty sure he was not meant...

7106
04:39:10,370 --> 04:39:10,990
Oh, there we go.

7107
04:39:11,030 --> 04:39:11,470
He hit me.

7108
04:39:11,630 --> 04:39:13,250
He really hit me.

7109
04:39:16,110 --> 04:39:16,630
Oh.

7110
04:39:16,670 --> 04:39:16,730
Oh.

7111
04:39:16,730 --> 04:39:16,890
Oh.

7112
04:39:16,890 --> 04:39:17,470
Oh my god.

7113
04:39:18,030 --> 04:39:18,970
They did it.

7114
04:39:20,330 --> 04:39:20,770
Guys...

7115
04:39:20,770 --> 04:39:21,230
I don't give a f*** right now.

7116
04:39:21,230 --> 04:39:22,210
They used Nano, at least.

7117
04:39:22,470 --> 04:39:23,730
This team...

7118
04:39:25,070 --> 04:39:26,090
I'm almost back.

7119
04:39:26,130 --> 04:39:27,110
This team might not be it.

7120
04:39:27,630 --> 04:39:28,970
This team might not be it.

7121
04:39:29,910 --> 04:39:31,370
He might not have the run.

7122
04:39:31,750 --> 04:39:32,750
This sim might not be it.

7123
04:39:37,370 --> 04:39:37,810
This...

7124
04:39:37,810 --> 04:39:39,550
This was just not it?

7125
04:39:44,050 --> 04:39:44,930
Is it?

7126
04:39:45,590 --> 04:39:46,370
It was just...

7127
04:39:46,370 --> 04:39:46,710
This team was just...

7128
04:39:46,710 --> 04:39:47,990
This team was just not it, guys!

7129
04:39:48,270 --> 04:39:48,970
It was just...

7130
04:39:50,160 --> 04:39:50,830
You know...

7131
04:39:50,830 --> 04:39:52,330
There was nothing we could do.

7132
04:39:55,290 --> 04:39:56,830
It took us...

7133
04:39:57,140 --> 04:40:02,570
It took us 10 deaths for our Widow to out-Widow the Widow.

7134
04:40:06,590 --> 04:40:07,650
It was just that.

7135
04:40:08,510 --> 04:40:09,530
It really was.

7136
04:40:09,890 --> 04:40:10,850
It's just not it.

7137
04:40:11,730 --> 04:40:13,050
It's just not it.

7138
04:40:14,650 --> 04:40:15,930
Next match, surely.

7139
04:40:15,930 --> 04:40:16,170
Surely.

7140
04:40:20,030 --> 04:40:22,350
It's the next match is when our win streak starts.

7141
04:40:22,610 --> 04:40:23,130
I believe.

7142
04:40:25,090 --> 04:40:25,590
Guys.

7143
04:40:27,350 --> 04:40:29,250
This is when our next match starts.

7144
04:40:32,270 --> 04:40:32,770
Guys.

7145
04:40:33,110 --> 04:40:35,770
I think I might need a refund on my insurance though.

7146
04:40:39,830 --> 04:40:46,430
I think I might need a refund.

7147
04:40:51,070 --> 04:40:51,550
I think I might need a refund on my insurance though.

7148
04:40:51,550 --> 04:40:52,330
Yo yo yo.

7149
04:40:52,510 --> 04:40:53,830
How you guys doing?

7150
04:40:54,110 --> 04:40:56,790
I will not leave a broken world alive!

7151
04:40:56,790 --> 04:40:57,530
Alright, this is it.

7152
04:40:58,450 --> 04:41:00,150
I don't know how you do it, Ana.

7153
04:41:00,150 --> 04:41:01,890
This is the win streak starts.

7154
04:41:02,630 --> 04:41:03,970
The win streak starts here.

7155
04:41:04,350 --> 04:41:05,070
Waiting for the perfect shot.

7156
04:41:05,550 --> 04:41:07,370
When the win streak starts here.

7157
04:41:07,550 --> 04:41:08,650
Waiting for the perfect shot.

7158
04:41:09,110 --> 04:41:10,510
This is it.

7159
04:41:12,310 --> 04:41:14,010
Guys, Bacon, what happened?

7160
04:41:14,130 --> 04:41:15,770
I thought you were paying for my insurance.

7161
04:41:15,910 --> 04:41:16,250
Bacon?

7162
04:41:16,730 --> 04:41:17,710
What happened?

7163
04:41:20,610 --> 04:41:21,210
Faken!

7164
04:41:21,410 --> 04:41:23,330
Did you miss out on the last month's payment?

7165
04:41:27,210 --> 04:41:30,130
Did you miss out?

7166
04:41:34,950 --> 04:41:36,390
Fighting the win streak.

7167
04:41:38,310 --> 04:41:39,490
Oh no.

7168
04:41:40,530 --> 04:41:41,910
Not a bot.

7169
04:41:43,590 --> 04:41:45,570
Guys, I swear to god.

7170
04:41:47,330 --> 04:41:47,990
Please.

7171
04:41:48,930 --> 04:41:49,590
Please.

7172
04:41:49,870 --> 04:41:50,530
I...

7173
04:41:53,430 --> 04:41:54,090
Please.

7174
04:41:54,250 --> 04:41:56,310
I'm... Our team is dead.

7175
04:41:57,390 --> 04:41:58,650
It's not okay.

7176
04:41:58,970 --> 04:41:59,950
We got two.

7177
04:42:01,210 --> 04:42:01,870
Woo!

7178
04:42:03,270 --> 04:42:04,050
Don't touch me!

7179
04:42:04,670 --> 04:42:06,150
Don't touch me little bot!

7180
04:42:07,810 --> 04:42:08,470
No!

7181
04:42:13,350 --> 04:42:14,770
She's gonna start sucking!

7182
04:42:17,210 --> 04:42:18,470
Somebody save me!

7183
04:42:23,570 --> 04:42:24,850
Okay, we're fine.

7184
04:42:26,470 --> 04:42:27,310
Okay.

7185
04:42:27,410 --> 04:42:31,110
No amount of money can save this.

7186
04:42:31,230 --> 04:42:32,010
I'm sorry.

7187
04:42:34,050 --> 04:42:34,890
No!

7188
04:42:34,930 --> 04:42:36,090
Don't say that!

7189
04:42:38,030 --> 04:42:39,490
It's not me!

7190
04:42:39,950 --> 04:42:42,630
Thank you for the Akasufa, Faken.

7191
04:42:42,790 --> 04:42:44,610
It's not me!

7192
04:42:44,690 --> 04:42:45,530
I swear!

7193
04:42:50,690 --> 04:42:51,110
Okay.

7194
04:42:51,110 --> 04:42:52,310
Oh shit.

7195
04:42:54,130 --> 04:42:56,110
Like, what the fuck am I supposed to...

7196
04:42:56,810 --> 04:42:57,370
Bro!

7197
04:42:57,530 --> 04:42:59,070
I sucked it 20 times!

7198
04:43:00,970 --> 04:43:02,130
Don't boot me in here.

7199
04:43:02,350 --> 04:43:03,170
Oh god.

7200
04:43:03,210 --> 04:43:05,490
I will nano if it means I die.

7201
04:43:06,070 --> 04:43:08,370
I will nano if it means I die.

7202
04:43:09,050 --> 04:43:09,610
Oh!

7203
04:43:12,650 --> 04:43:14,290
I said I would... No!

7204
04:43:14,510 --> 04:43:15,030
No!

7205
04:43:17,310 --> 04:43:17,870
Why?

7206
04:43:17,870 --> 04:43:20,910
Why is there three people on the enemy team?

7207
04:43:22,010 --> 04:43:23,410
On our spawn!

7208
04:43:26,010 --> 04:43:26,710
Hold on.

7209
04:43:27,050 --> 04:43:28,070
I hooked this guy.

7210
04:43:30,330 --> 04:43:30,850
Look!

7211
04:43:30,850 --> 04:43:32,010
It's just...

7212
04:43:33,410 --> 04:43:33,930
Look!

7213
04:43:34,030 --> 04:43:37,130
It's just that like... my insurance ran out again.

7214
04:43:37,290 --> 04:43:37,810
Don't worry.

7215
04:43:37,970 --> 04:43:40,070
I got bacon... bacon like...

7216
04:43:40,070 --> 04:43:40,950
Here's an IOU.

7217
04:43:41,110 --> 04:43:44,510
Bacon, thanks for paying again for my insurance again.

7218
04:43:46,470 --> 04:43:47,310
Oh my god.

7219
04:43:47,330 --> 04:43:49,730
He like dropped in a way I didn't think he was gonna drop.

7220
04:43:53,110 --> 04:43:53,930
Oh god.

7221
04:43:54,790 --> 04:43:55,570
Oh god.

7222
04:43:55,730 --> 04:43:56,110
Please.

7223
04:43:56,290 --> 04:43:57,750
Please somebody kill him.

7224
04:43:57,850 --> 04:43:58,170
I'm okay.

7225
04:43:58,550 --> 04:43:59,270
Are you?

7226
04:43:59,470 --> 04:44:00,210
He is.

7227
04:44:00,950 --> 04:44:01,750
Spoiler alert.

7228
04:44:01,770 --> 04:44:02,470
He was okay.

7229
04:44:05,630 --> 04:44:07,310
What's going on down there?

7230
04:44:10,790 --> 04:44:11,430
It's okay.

7231
04:44:15,930 --> 04:44:17,210
Oh god, Ruben.

7232
04:44:17,310 --> 04:44:18,310
Oh god, Ruben.

7233
04:44:19,190 --> 04:44:20,110
Ruben, I'm scared.

7234
04:44:20,170 --> 04:44:20,630
Ruben.

7235
04:44:22,850 --> 04:44:29,190
Oh my god, he lives?

7236
04:44:32,050 --> 04:44:33,010
I'll punch you!

7237
04:44:34,130 --> 04:44:34,950
There you go.

7238
04:44:36,570 --> 04:44:37,570
See, we did it.

7239
04:44:37,710 --> 04:44:40,690
I have one... one death.

7240
04:44:45,090 --> 04:44:46,810
I told you it was okay.

7241
04:44:49,570 --> 04:44:50,610
I'm gonna go back to the base.

7242
04:44:50,610 --> 04:44:51,250
Guys, I told you.

7243
04:44:56,710 --> 04:44:57,270
It's okay.

7244
04:44:58,810 --> 04:44:59,570
We can do this.

7245
04:44:59,670 --> 04:45:00,510
The win streak is real.

7246
04:45:01,050 --> 04:45:01,770
This is it.

7247
04:45:01,910 --> 04:45:04,370
We just need to win four games in a row, guys.

7248
04:45:04,710 --> 04:45:05,930
Guys, you know, I know why.

7249
04:45:06,230 --> 04:45:07,630
I know why I haven't been winning.

7250
04:45:08,070 --> 04:45:09,630
You guys haven't been believing in me.

7251
04:45:10,890 --> 04:45:14,850
If one person bets against me, it's over.

7252
04:45:15,410 --> 04:45:15,770
Okay.

7253
04:45:15,930 --> 04:45:16,210
Okay.

7254
04:45:20,390 --> 04:45:21,350
What is this TP?

7255
04:45:21,990 --> 04:45:23,550
So you only have...

7256
04:45:24,670 --> 04:45:26,510
So it's everybody's fault.

7257
04:45:29,430 --> 04:45:30,150
No, no.

7258
04:45:30,190 --> 04:45:32,390
I'm not saying it's your fault, dragoons.

7259
04:45:32,550 --> 04:45:35,770
I'm saying it's everybody's fault.

7260
04:45:35,890 --> 04:45:36,750
That's different.

7261
04:45:38,570 --> 04:45:40,410
Hey, they just gave us high ground.

7262
04:45:40,690 --> 04:45:41,430
This is awesome.

7263
04:45:43,190 --> 04:45:44,270
Guys, it's different.

7264
04:45:47,030 --> 04:45:48,430
Oh no, they have Wido.

7265
04:45:50,390 --> 04:45:51,290
They have dive Wido.

7266
04:45:51,350 --> 04:45:52,110
Is that fucking...

7267
04:45:55,370 --> 04:45:56,350
Where's the dive?

7268
04:45:56,690 --> 04:45:57,910
Where was the dive?

7269
04:46:01,970 --> 04:46:04,590
I heard I'm going to dive Wido.

7270
04:46:04,690 --> 04:46:06,270
I didn't see no dive.

7271
04:46:06,550 --> 04:46:08,330
No, Wido killed two of us.

7272
04:46:08,830 --> 04:46:10,690
How is there ever a dive?

7273
04:46:15,550 --> 04:46:17,750
Oh no, I fucking... He's dead.

7274
04:46:17,990 --> 04:46:18,670
He's so dead.

7275
04:46:18,910 --> 04:46:21,090
Guys, I'm in a bit of a precarious situation.

7276
04:46:23,590 --> 04:46:26,090
Okay, so... Ruben fed.

7277
04:46:29,490 --> 04:46:33,570
Ruben baited us all with the I'm going to dive Wido.

7278
04:46:36,210 --> 04:46:37,670
We got baited, guys.

7279
04:46:41,810 --> 04:46:42,270
What?

7280
04:46:42,270 --> 04:46:44,950
How did he dodge that?

7281
04:46:47,630 --> 04:46:48,850
Oh my god, she shot himself.

7282
04:46:50,570 --> 04:46:52,770
I'm going to ignore the ball and you guys are going to be okay.

7283
04:46:53,470 --> 04:46:54,110
Will we?

7284
04:46:54,650 --> 04:46:55,430
I don't know.

7285
04:46:55,490 --> 04:46:56,270
I don't feel okay.

7286
04:46:58,210 --> 04:46:59,430
I don't feel okay.

7287
04:47:00,170 --> 04:47:01,750
I really don't feel okay.

7288
04:47:03,990 --> 04:47:05,410
I don't feel okay.

7289
04:47:08,690 --> 04:47:10,830
Please, somebody get rid of him.

7290
04:47:11,630 --> 04:47:12,570
You can kill this guy.

7291
04:47:12,750 --> 04:47:13,450
Look at him.

7292
04:47:13,630 --> 04:47:14,970
Look at him fuck up his back.

7293
04:47:15,350 --> 04:47:16,390
I'm going to dive Wido.

7294
04:47:16,450 --> 04:47:16,610
It's okay.

7295
04:47:17,210 --> 04:47:19,270
I am unbreakable.

7296
04:47:19,430 --> 04:47:19,910
There you go.

7297
04:47:20,830 --> 04:47:21,530
Damn right.

7298
04:47:21,670 --> 04:47:22,630
I got those mines.

7299
04:47:24,350 --> 04:47:28,750
I had to make my first ever super chat to select you know, to lock in.

7300
04:47:29,770 --> 04:47:32,150
Thank you for this super chat for...

7301
04:47:32,150 --> 04:47:35,610
Thank you for making the insurance payments for me, guys.

7302
04:47:36,670 --> 04:47:37,710
Are you serious?

7303
04:47:41,050 --> 04:47:43,890
Guys, you're helping me make my insurance...

7304
04:47:44,730 --> 04:47:46,890
You're helping me pay off my insurance, guys.

7305
04:47:46,950 --> 04:47:47,970
I really appreciate it.

7306
04:47:49,130 --> 04:47:50,230
This is actually crazy.

7307
04:47:50,230 --> 04:47:53,990
This insurance only lasts like one minute.

7308
04:47:56,750 --> 04:47:58,790
Oh my god, he's so low!

7309
04:48:04,850 --> 04:48:05,870
God damn it!

7310
04:48:05,930 --> 04:48:06,730
Stop!

7311
04:48:09,330 --> 04:48:13,130
Bro, he's actually... he's just a nuisance.

7312
04:48:20,860 --> 04:48:22,140
Are you... okay.

7313
04:48:22,400 --> 04:48:23,700
I give up.

7314
04:48:26,660 --> 04:48:28,380
Bro, leave us alone!

7315
04:48:29,360 --> 04:48:30,410
This is why...

7316
04:48:32,500 --> 04:48:34,760
Bro, Hammond... oh my god, he's dead.

7317
04:48:35,000 --> 04:48:36,220
He's fucking dead.

7318
04:48:36,900 --> 04:48:39,240
Bro, this is actually an infestation problem.

7319
04:48:42,720 --> 04:48:45,340
What the fuck is going on?

7320
04:48:45,360 --> 04:48:46,560
What is going on over there?

7321
04:48:47,420 --> 04:48:48,860
What is going on?

7322
04:48:49,000 --> 04:48:50,860
I swear it's only been the Hammond.

7323
04:48:54,120 --> 04:48:55,460
I swear to god.

7324
04:48:55,880 --> 04:48:57,820
Somebody stop this Hammond!

7325
04:49:02,340 --> 04:49:03,900
Oh, peek me, please.

7326
04:49:05,060 --> 04:49:05,900
Oh god.

7327
04:49:07,600 --> 04:49:08,160
Guys.

7328
04:49:09,380 --> 04:49:12,560
Guys, I'm dead.

7329
04:49:13,160 --> 04:49:14,240
I'm so dead.

7330
04:49:14,440 --> 04:49:15,340
Guys, I did it.

7331
04:49:15,360 --> 04:49:16,360
I hit my first...

7332
04:49:17,500 --> 04:49:17,880
Goodbye.

7333
04:49:24,300 --> 04:49:25,340
Holy shit.

7334
04:49:25,580 --> 04:49:27,420
Yes, he's very annoying.

7335
04:49:31,410 --> 04:49:32,570
Alright, this is it.

7336
04:49:32,670 --> 04:49:33,570
I'll nano...

7337
04:49:34,190 --> 04:49:35,750
I'll nano the Sojin.

7338
04:49:35,970 --> 04:49:37,410
And then Wind Streak starts now.

7339
04:49:40,980 --> 04:49:42,460
Hey, I'm coming back.

7340
04:49:42,900 --> 04:49:44,200
Bro, this Hammond...

7341
04:49:44,200 --> 04:49:45,980
Someone please call the exterminator.

7342
04:49:46,240 --> 04:49:48,180
These hamsters have been fucking too much.

7343
04:49:49,940 --> 04:49:51,900
We have a hamster problem.

7344
04:49:54,400 --> 04:49:55,980
I slept the target.

7345
04:49:56,320 --> 04:49:56,800
Alright.

7346
04:49:57,200 --> 04:49:57,640
It's go time.

7347
04:49:58,460 --> 04:49:59,380
Oh, whoops.

7348
04:49:59,400 --> 04:49:59,440
Really sad.

7349
04:50:00,300 --> 04:50:00,780
Whoops.

7350
04:50:01,180 --> 04:50:02,000
This is it.

7351
04:50:02,020 --> 04:50:02,520
This is it.

7352
04:50:02,560 --> 04:50:03,160
This is it.

7353
04:50:03,480 --> 04:50:04,200
This is...

7354
04:50:04,200 --> 04:50:05,240
Oh, they're all running away.

7355
04:50:05,920 --> 04:50:07,120
But this wasn't it.

7356
04:50:10,380 --> 04:50:12,500
Their brig is bottom right.

7357
04:50:12,860 --> 04:50:13,640
This was...

7358
04:50:13,640 --> 04:50:15,600
Oh, he was, but I didn't.

7359
04:50:16,340 --> 04:50:16,820
I'm so sorry.

7360
04:50:17,680 --> 04:50:18,160
I'm so sorry.

7361
04:50:18,160 --> 04:50:18,760
Okay.

7362
04:50:19,060 --> 04:50:20,500
He was bottom right.

7363
04:50:20,660 --> 04:50:21,440
We did it, guys.

7364
04:50:21,700 --> 04:50:22,800
Wind Streak starts now.

7365
04:50:23,440 --> 04:50:25,060
This ends now.

7366
04:50:26,560 --> 04:50:27,620
I told you.

7367
04:50:28,420 --> 04:50:30,220
Wind Streak starts now.

7368
04:50:30,320 --> 04:50:31,400
This is it, guys.

7369
04:50:31,700 --> 04:50:32,500
This is it.

7370
04:50:32,560 --> 04:50:36,400
I know you've been watching five hours of Overwatch, but this is it.

7371
04:50:42,910 --> 04:50:43,960
This is it.

7372
04:50:44,720 --> 04:50:46,780
This is all you've been waiting for.

7373
04:50:46,780 --> 04:50:48,160
I told you!

7374
04:50:48,280 --> 04:50:48,800
Bacon!

7375
04:50:49,040 --> 04:50:50,200
I told you, Bacon!

7376
04:50:52,340 --> 04:50:53,000
Guys...

7377
04:50:55,480 --> 04:50:57,920
Guys... I told you guys...

7378
04:50:57,920 --> 04:50:59,680
My insurance...

7379
04:50:59,680 --> 04:51:04,400
My insurance only lasts like per game, okay?

7380
04:51:08,880 --> 04:51:12,080
It lasts every... per game, guys.

7381
04:51:12,180 --> 04:51:12,980
I told you.

7382
04:51:12,980 --> 04:51:16,760
That's why... That's why...

7383
04:51:19,800 --> 04:51:23,140
That's why we are having issues.

7384
04:51:27,800 --> 04:51:29,540
But this is where...

7385
04:51:29,540 --> 04:51:32,640
This is where our luck changes.

7386
04:51:35,040 --> 04:51:37,360
This is where our luck changes right here.

7387
04:51:37,740 --> 04:51:39,880
The bar stays the same.

7388
04:51:45,260 --> 04:51:46,220
Here we go.

7389
04:51:46,720 --> 04:51:47,520
Here we go.

7390
04:51:47,640 --> 04:51:48,440
I believe...

7391
04:51:48,820 --> 04:51:49,420
I believe.

7392
04:51:51,860 --> 04:51:52,740
Thanks for the win.

7393
04:51:52,800 --> 04:51:52,940
Yeah!

7394
04:51:53,080 --> 04:51:54,540
Shout out to Bacon guys!

7395
04:51:54,800 --> 04:51:57,640
We got a huge shout out to Bacon for getting us that win.

7396
04:51:57,860 --> 04:52:01,220
And he said no amount of money can save this!

7397
04:52:01,600 --> 04:52:02,820
You are wrong!

7398
04:52:08,320 --> 04:52:10,620
We just need to We just need to extend the insurance!

7399
04:52:11,920 --> 04:52:12,960
Black, thank you for this help!

7400
04:52:12,980 --> 04:52:13,740
Thank you!

7401
04:52:14,800 --> 04:52:16,260
I told you.

7402
04:52:16,880 --> 04:52:18,580
It's just really bad insurance.

7403
04:52:18,920 --> 04:52:19,860
Like, my...

7404
04:52:19,860 --> 04:52:22,400
I got like the cheapest one.

7405
04:52:27,440 --> 04:52:29,900
So that's why it expires so fast.

7406
04:52:31,760 --> 04:52:33,160
Expires so fucking fast.

7407
04:52:33,320 --> 04:52:34,780
Because it only lasts a game each.

7408
04:52:42,630 --> 04:52:43,810
Thank you for the super chat.

7409
04:52:43,870 --> 04:52:45,370
Is Diamond a good rank?

7410
04:52:45,370 --> 04:52:47,790
Well, it's more so of like...

7411
04:52:47,790 --> 04:52:51,070
The player base is not as big as it used to be.

7412
04:52:51,310 --> 04:52:55,370
And because the player base is not as big as it used to be...

7413
04:52:55,370 --> 04:52:58,950
Diamond for tank is top 500 now.

7414
04:53:00,070 --> 04:53:00,590
So...

7415
04:53:02,250 --> 04:53:03,890
Many thank you for the super chat.

7416
04:53:03,930 --> 04:53:04,190
Thank you.

7417
04:53:04,210 --> 04:53:04,570
Thank you.

7418
04:53:04,630 --> 04:53:10,290
This insurance does not cover any rank loss but comes with a complimentary 5.10.

7419
04:53:10,530 --> 04:53:12,030
Thank you for the super chat.

7420
04:53:12,130 --> 04:53:12,470
Thank you.

7421
04:53:12,510 --> 04:53:12,910
Thank you.

7422
04:53:12,970 --> 04:53:13,470
Hat.

7423
04:53:13,670 --> 04:53:14,730
10 bucks you...

7424
04:53:14,730 --> 04:53:15,150
What?

7425
04:53:15,370 --> 04:53:16,750
Why would you bet it?

7426
04:53:16,750 --> 04:53:18,030
You have a gambling problem, Hat.

7427
04:53:18,250 --> 04:53:19,550
Thank you for the super chat.

7428
04:53:19,670 --> 04:53:20,070
Thank you.

7429
04:53:20,230 --> 04:53:20,730
Thank you.

7430
04:53:22,010 --> 04:53:23,130
Paladins next time?

7431
04:53:23,170 --> 04:53:25,510
Bro, I played Paladins like a little bit.

7432
04:53:25,730 --> 04:53:27,230
I think like a couple of weeks ago.

7433
04:53:27,730 --> 04:53:29,050
And oh my god.

7434
04:53:29,790 --> 04:53:30,890
Yo, yo, yo.

7435
04:53:31,130 --> 04:53:32,310
How you guys doing?

7436
04:53:32,390 --> 04:53:34,030
I have bumped into team...

7437
04:53:34,030 --> 04:53:37,130
Like, I bumped into players with like max...

7438
04:53:37,130 --> 04:53:39,630
Like, not max but really high level players.

7439
04:53:40,490 --> 04:53:40,950
Who...

7440
04:53:41,690 --> 04:53:43,650
I think I was in Bronze, you know.

7441
04:53:43,650 --> 04:53:45,470
Because I never played the game.

7442
04:53:45,550 --> 04:53:46,230
So they're MMR.

7443
04:53:46,370 --> 04:53:47,090
They weren't bots.

7444
04:53:47,270 --> 04:53:49,490
You can tell when somebody's a bot or not.

7445
04:53:49,710 --> 04:53:50,850
Because it has like...

7446
04:53:50,850 --> 04:53:52,310
They don't have like any...

7447
04:53:52,310 --> 04:53:53,050
Like...

7448
04:53:53,550 --> 04:53:54,610
Like they actually have...

7449
04:53:54,610 --> 04:53:55,330
They have no name.

7450
04:53:56,010 --> 04:53:56,570
I'm Ryan.

7451
04:53:59,090 --> 04:54:00,190
Wait, they're all Ryan.

7452
04:54:01,750 --> 04:54:03,330
I'll take the pet.

7453
04:54:03,510 --> 04:54:04,390
That's fucked up.

7454
04:54:04,550 --> 04:54:05,630
That's fucked up.

7455
04:54:05,830 --> 04:54:06,070
Oh sh...

7456
04:54:08,530 --> 04:54:09,090
Alright.

7457
04:54:10,410 --> 04:54:11,270
Please no...

7458
04:54:11,270 --> 04:54:12,890
Oh my god.

7459
04:54:12,890 --> 04:54:13,230
Oh my god.

7460
04:54:14,730 --> 04:54:15,250
Okay.

7461
04:54:15,650 --> 04:54:16,830
I slept somebody.

7462
04:54:17,930 --> 04:54:19,710
Oh, our Hanzo is fucking dead.

7463
04:54:20,290 --> 04:54:21,330
I'm fucking dead!

7464
04:54:28,860 --> 04:54:29,380
Alright.

7465
04:54:32,820 --> 04:54:33,340
Okay.

7466
04:54:33,500 --> 04:54:34,360
We have Pharah.

7467
04:54:35,040 --> 04:54:36,280
So we have to go this.

7468
04:54:38,040 --> 04:54:39,740
Oh, this is kind of...

7469
04:54:39,740 --> 04:54:40,140
No, no.

7470
04:54:40,160 --> 04:54:41,420
Thank you for the super chat.

7471
04:54:41,520 --> 04:54:41,980
Thank you.

7472
04:54:42,000 --> 04:54:42,620
Thank you.

7473
04:54:46,200 --> 04:54:46,700
So...

7474
04:54:46,700 --> 04:54:46,860
It's okay.

7475
04:54:47,720 --> 04:54:49,380
It's not okay for our Pharah.

7476
04:54:49,560 --> 04:54:50,140
It's okay.

7477
04:54:50,340 --> 04:54:52,360
There's no way...

7478
04:54:52,360 --> 04:54:52,960
Yep.

7479
04:54:52,980 --> 04:54:53,440
Never mind.

7480
04:54:55,340 --> 04:54:56,880
Here we go.

7481
04:54:57,060 --> 04:54:59,940
What have I done to deserve this?

7482
04:55:00,000 --> 04:55:00,440
It's okay.

7483
04:55:01,200 --> 04:55:01,700
Oh!

7484
04:55:02,320 --> 04:55:03,360
I'm fucking running.

7485
04:55:03,520 --> 04:55:04,680
It's not okay.

7486
04:55:06,560 --> 04:55:07,660
It's not okay.

7487
04:55:11,300 --> 04:55:12,000
It's fine.

7488
04:55:13,220 --> 04:55:13,980
Just go.

7489
04:55:13,980 --> 04:55:14,160
Go!

7490
04:55:14,160 --> 04:55:14,740
Just go!

7491
04:55:14,840 --> 04:55:15,400
Just go!

7492
04:55:16,140 --> 04:55:16,920
Just go!

7493
04:55:20,880 --> 04:55:22,320
Bro, I'll fucking go!

7494
04:55:22,700 --> 04:55:23,880
Oh, I won't go.

7495
04:55:25,980 --> 04:55:27,500
Bro, he's still alive!

7496
04:55:27,780 --> 04:55:28,740
Get her away!

7497
04:55:30,480 --> 04:55:33,340
Hey guys, thank you Super Chat, thank you, thank you.

7498
04:55:34,000 --> 04:55:35,920
Bill, thank you Super Chat, thank you, thank you.

7499
04:55:36,700 --> 04:55:38,060
Mikdas3 in the pool for gambling.

7500
04:55:38,160 --> 04:55:39,320
She wins this.

7501
04:55:40,420 --> 04:55:42,240
Thank you Super Chat, thank you, thank you.

7502
04:55:43,180 --> 04:55:47,260
Twenty bucks, you lose, win, lose, win.

7503
04:55:50,080 --> 04:55:51,200
This is fucked up.

7504
04:55:51,320 --> 04:55:53,020
What if I match-fix this right now?

7505
04:55:55,640 --> 04:55:57,400
But like, I should have said that out loud.

7506
04:55:57,540 --> 04:56:02,180
So if I like, you know, whichever pool has the most money, and then somehow...

7507
04:56:02,180 --> 04:56:02,240
Ooh.

7508
04:56:05,000 --> 04:56:05,480
Okay.

7509
04:56:05,680 --> 04:56:06,660
We're good.

7510
04:56:07,420 --> 04:56:08,140
We're okay.

7511
04:56:12,320 --> 04:56:13,480
What is he gonna do?

7512
04:56:13,580 --> 04:56:14,080
Kill us?

7513
04:56:15,360 --> 04:56:16,180
See, we're fine.

7514
04:56:17,020 --> 04:56:19,280
Oh my god, there's a soldier behind us.

7515
04:56:19,960 --> 04:56:20,860
Kill the soldier!

7516
04:56:21,360 --> 04:56:23,000
Kill the soldier!

7517
04:56:23,040 --> 04:56:24,140
Hey, soldier's dead.

7518
04:56:26,240 --> 04:56:26,880
Soldier's dead.

7519
04:56:28,020 --> 04:56:28,820
Soldier's dead.

7520
04:56:29,400 --> 04:56:30,860
Get this mora off me!

7521
04:56:31,440 --> 04:56:32,000
Do it.

7522
04:56:32,200 --> 04:56:32,740
Kill her.

7523
04:56:33,380 --> 04:56:34,160
Okay, we're fine.

7524
04:56:34,820 --> 04:56:38,440
Betting your favor never seems to work, so I'm betting against you now.

7525
04:56:38,740 --> 04:56:40,120
Guys, thank you for the Super Chat.

7526
04:56:40,120 --> 04:56:41,100
Thank you, thank you.

7527
04:56:41,620 --> 04:56:42,440
Look at that.

7528
04:56:46,640 --> 04:56:52,160
E-sports gambling is now legal in 37 states.

7529
04:56:52,500 --> 04:56:53,560
I'm Canadian!

7530
04:56:56,640 --> 04:56:58,080
Wait, it's more legal.

7531
04:56:58,320 --> 04:56:59,140
Wait, never mind.

7532
04:56:59,420 --> 04:56:59,920
You're right.

7533
04:57:00,040 --> 04:57:00,740
Wait, it works.

7534
04:57:00,740 --> 04:57:01,180
Never mind.

7535
04:57:01,520 --> 04:57:04,020
It works because it's legal everywhere.

7536
04:57:04,280 --> 04:57:05,380
That's fucking right.

7537
04:57:07,280 --> 04:57:09,080
I forgot about that.

7538
04:57:10,280 --> 04:57:12,400
It's legal everywhere in Canada.

7539
04:57:12,620 --> 04:57:15,240
That's why streamers move to Canada.

7540
04:57:15,380 --> 04:57:15,960
The gamble!

7541
04:57:16,460 --> 04:57:18,080
It's actually true!

7542
04:57:18,620 --> 04:57:21,720
Streamers move to Canada to fucking gamble!

7543
04:57:22,220 --> 04:57:23,700
Because it's legal.

7544
04:57:24,140 --> 04:57:25,720
It's so fucked up.

7545
04:57:29,900 --> 04:57:30,500
It's true!

7546
04:57:31,300 --> 04:57:33,540
It's true, it was a whole big deal.

7547
04:57:33,900 --> 04:57:34,400
No!

7548
04:57:34,840 --> 04:57:36,100
The gold Kiriko!

7549
04:57:37,940 --> 04:57:38,660
Alright.

7550
04:57:40,580 --> 04:57:41,020
Yeah.

7551
04:57:42,760 --> 04:57:43,200
Yeah!

7552
04:57:43,980 --> 04:57:46,180
You know like those streamers that do like gambling?

7553
04:57:46,480 --> 04:57:48,040
Like those gambling streams?

7554
04:57:48,420 --> 04:57:50,980
On like, not Twitch, was it Kik or some shit now?

7555
04:57:51,140 --> 04:57:53,120
Or like, I don't even know if you can do it on Twitch anymore.

7556
04:57:53,400 --> 04:57:56,880
But like, it's because like, um...

7557
04:57:58,060 --> 04:58:00,900
It's because they have to move to Canada to do it.

7558
04:58:00,920 --> 04:58:02,300
Because it's legal in Canada.

7559
04:58:02,960 --> 04:58:03,400
Hahaha!

7560
04:58:03,400 --> 04:58:03,580
Hahaha!

7561
04:58:07,420 --> 04:58:09,900
Their back is half-ish and they have no nade.

7562
04:58:10,000 --> 04:58:11,300
Okay, I saved him.

7563
04:58:11,380 --> 04:58:12,200
I'm a hero.

7564
04:58:13,220 --> 04:58:14,680
I'm a fucking hero.

7565
04:58:16,400 --> 04:58:16,920
Alright.

7566
04:58:17,360 --> 04:58:19,260
Is Baden forever on Twitch for real?

7567
04:58:19,520 --> 04:58:19,940
This is mine now.

7568
04:58:23,380 --> 04:58:24,740
Alright, we don't care.

7569
04:58:24,960 --> 04:58:26,040
Yeah, I'll take this.

7570
04:58:27,040 --> 04:58:28,040
Sorry Ana.

7571
04:58:30,820 --> 04:58:31,340
Oh!

7572
04:58:31,580 --> 04:58:32,060
Hey!

7573
04:58:32,220 --> 04:58:34,600
You know, Tracer, help me out, Tracer.

7574
04:58:35,760 --> 04:58:37,680
Tracer, help me out.

7575
04:58:38,800 --> 04:58:39,320
Oh!

7576
04:58:39,440 --> 04:58:41,140
This is where we all die, I guess.

7577
04:58:45,020 --> 04:58:46,900
This is where we all die.

7578
04:58:49,440 --> 04:58:49,960
Unless...

7579
04:58:51,540 --> 04:58:52,060
Nevermind!

7580
04:58:52,160 --> 04:58:54,560
Everybody got the Suzu except for him.

7581
04:58:59,840 --> 04:59:02,080
Hey guys, can you guys not die?

7582
04:59:04,460 --> 04:59:05,700
This is bad.

7583
04:59:06,480 --> 04:59:07,400
This is bad.

7584
04:59:07,620 --> 04:59:08,540
This is bad.

7585
04:59:10,780 --> 04:59:11,700
I'm saved.

7586
04:59:13,120 --> 04:59:15,020
They're honest that we're only down one.

7587
04:59:15,400 --> 04:59:15,880
Yeah.

7588
04:59:16,860 --> 04:59:17,340
One.

7589
04:59:19,040 --> 04:59:22,820
Take a lot of damage, huh?

7590
04:59:22,900 --> 04:59:25,120
Yeah, it was definitely one.

7591
04:59:25,420 --> 04:59:26,580
Okay, I might have been hit.

7592
04:59:26,640 --> 04:59:31,180
Yeah, we were definitely down one.

7593
04:59:31,320 --> 04:59:32,000
I'm gonna get my Minecraft.

7594
04:59:32,000 --> 04:59:33,680
They just whiffed post-match.

7595
04:59:33,680 --> 04:59:33,940
I dodged.

7596
04:59:35,780 --> 04:59:39,080
You can't f***ing DM my f***ing heals though.

7597
04:59:39,700 --> 04:59:40,260
Oh!

7598
04:59:40,980 --> 04:59:42,060
Oh my god.

7599
04:59:43,340 --> 04:59:45,360
Guys, I think we're gonna lose our...

7600
04:59:45,360 --> 04:59:46,760
I think we're gonna lose our lead.

7601
04:59:48,140 --> 04:59:49,540
It's so over.

7602
04:59:50,020 --> 04:59:51,860
Bacon, thank you for the Magenta soup!

7603
04:59:51,920 --> 04:59:53,120
Thank you, thank you!

7604
04:59:53,860 --> 04:59:54,420
Bacon!

7605
04:59:54,940 --> 04:59:56,760
$50 in Doki's second win in a row.

7606
04:59:56,840 --> 04:59:57,500
It gotta happen.

7607
04:59:58,220 --> 04:59:58,780
Guys!

7608
04:59:59,320 --> 05:00:03,560
We will start a win streak right here, right now!

7609
05:00:04,300 --> 05:00:06,720
We will get our f***ing win streak!

7610
05:00:10,860 --> 05:00:11,820
I believe!

7611
05:00:13,220 --> 05:00:14,320
Come on, we gotta go.

7612
05:00:15,000 --> 05:00:16,080
We gotta go.

7613
05:00:16,820 --> 05:00:19,200
You and me, Soldier, we have to go.

7614
05:00:24,200 --> 05:00:25,480
This is it.

7615
05:00:26,440 --> 05:00:27,860
Alright, he has...

7616
05:00:28,700 --> 05:00:30,560
Okay, I need a...

7617
05:00:31,680 --> 05:00:32,520
Don't worry!

7618
05:00:32,900 --> 05:00:34,120
They just wasted bomb, dude.

7619
05:00:35,180 --> 05:00:36,940
Okay, I can't save you.

7620
05:00:40,440 --> 05:00:41,120
Please!

7621
05:00:41,120 --> 05:00:43,020
I needed you to be closer!

7622
05:00:47,300 --> 05:00:49,760
I needed you to be closer!

7623
05:00:50,340 --> 05:00:52,220
Who better could it be?

7624
05:00:54,700 --> 05:00:57,600
Alright, we're good.

7625
05:00:59,580 --> 05:01:01,160
Win rate starts here.

7626
05:01:04,160 --> 05:01:05,060
Right here.

7627
05:01:06,780 --> 05:01:07,700
Right now.

7628
05:01:08,340 --> 05:01:12,020
Right here.

7629
05:01:13,400 --> 05:01:14,420
Right now.

7630
05:01:17,220 --> 05:01:18,300
Please Robin!

7631
05:01:20,800 --> 05:01:22,860
Oh no!

7632
05:01:23,340 --> 05:01:24,500
Even now!

7633
05:01:27,600 --> 05:01:28,180
Please!

7634
05:01:28,280 --> 05:01:29,820
Just kill that guy!

7635
05:01:30,140 --> 05:01:31,600
Where's the rest of our team?

7636
05:01:33,640 --> 05:01:35,280
Where's the rest of our team?

7637
05:01:35,400 --> 05:01:36,820
Why are they going up?

7638
05:01:37,520 --> 05:01:39,460
Why are they still pushing this?

7639
05:01:40,220 --> 05:01:42,160
After everything we did!

7640
05:01:45,840 --> 05:01:47,040
He's literally won.

7641
05:01:51,700 --> 05:01:52,320
Oh.

7642
05:01:52,740 --> 05:01:53,700
God damn it.

7643
05:01:55,360 --> 05:01:56,160
We're fine.

7644
05:01:56,840 --> 05:01:57,640
We're fine.

7645
05:01:59,160 --> 05:02:00,620
Okay, I can swap back to Ana.

7646
05:02:00,740 --> 05:02:01,980
I don't have to play Kiriko anymore.

7647
05:02:02,680 --> 05:02:04,320
Okay, I'm pushing the payload.

7648
05:02:04,660 --> 05:02:05,800
I'm pushing the guy.

7649
05:02:07,460 --> 05:02:08,380
I'm pushing him.

7650
05:02:08,960 --> 05:02:10,100
Here we go.

7651
05:02:10,340 --> 05:02:11,280
Goodbye Ana.

7652
05:02:11,660 --> 05:02:12,780
Goodbye Tracer.

7653
05:02:13,020 --> 05:02:14,200
Oh, there they are.

7654
05:02:14,360 --> 05:02:15,420
We need our tank.

7655
05:02:15,840 --> 05:02:17,700
We need our tank.

7656
05:02:18,560 --> 05:02:19,040
Somebody!

7657
05:02:21,960 --> 05:02:23,040
I'm sorry Soldier.

7658
05:02:23,100 --> 05:02:24,600
If you die, you fucking die.

7659
05:02:27,220 --> 05:02:28,100
Okay, that's good.

7660
05:02:28,200 --> 05:02:28,440
That's good.

7661
05:02:28,440 --> 05:02:29,400
Ruben has ult.

7662
05:02:31,020 --> 05:02:32,060
Ruben has ult.

7663
05:02:32,160 --> 05:02:32,420
Oh!

7664
05:02:33,000 --> 05:02:33,840
It's okay.

7665
05:02:35,640 --> 05:02:37,140
It's not okay anymore.

7666
05:02:37,660 --> 05:02:40,520
It is absolutely not okay anymore.

7667
05:02:40,840 --> 05:02:44,720
It is a- It is absolutely not.

7668
05:02:44,960 --> 05:02:45,620
Just kill me.

7669
05:02:45,720 --> 05:02:47,460
Just kill me so I don't get staggered.

7670
05:02:53,180 --> 05:02:53,460
Yes.

7671
05:02:54,120 --> 05:02:55,980
We just need one good fight.

7672
05:02:56,300 --> 05:02:58,140
Can you be used?

7673
05:02:58,440 --> 05:02:59,160
Please!

7674
05:03:00,250 --> 05:03:01,560
Oh, shit.

7675
05:03:04,280 --> 05:03:06,000
Oh my god.

7676
05:03:10,260 --> 05:03:11,940
Oh my god.

7677
05:03:13,400 --> 05:03:16,620
That's actually crazy to say.

7678
05:03:21,130 --> 05:03:22,480
You're fucking welcome.

7679
05:03:27,780 --> 05:03:31,170
Oh, I wish we could kill a lot of things.

7680
05:03:31,170 --> 05:03:32,470
I'm calling out to DPS Warden in VC.

7681
05:03:34,050 --> 05:03:35,610
Oh my god!

7682
05:03:37,560 --> 05:03:40,650
All I'm saying is that you guys bet against me.

7683
05:03:42,080 --> 05:03:44,770
All I'm saying is that I fixed this match guys.

7684
05:03:45,190 --> 05:03:46,630
The match is fixed.

7685
05:03:55,180 --> 05:03:57,140
Guys I got the payout.

7686
05:03:58,460 --> 05:04:00,480
Guys, I got the payout.

7687
05:04:03,000 --> 05:04:05,620
It was because I fixed the match.

7688
05:04:05,860 --> 05:04:06,920
I lost intentionally.

7689
05:04:07,200 --> 05:04:09,760
So, I got the highest payout possible.

7690
05:04:10,980 --> 05:04:12,640
Looks like chat is right.

7691
05:04:12,740 --> 05:04:13,860
The cycle continues.

7692
05:04:15,080 --> 05:04:15,720
Guys,

7693
05:04:23,920 --> 05:04:28,580
it's because I did that on purpose guys.

7694
05:04:28,840 --> 05:04:30,080
I did that on purpose.

7695
05:04:33,380 --> 05:04:34,540
We're back where we started.

7696
05:04:34,560 --> 05:04:34,940
We were.

7697
05:04:35,680 --> 05:04:37,520
We're actually back where we were.

7698
05:04:38,040 --> 05:04:39,600
After five hours.

7699
05:04:42,740 --> 05:04:45,020
I deserve to play Mercy at that point.

7700
05:04:47,060 --> 05:04:48,540
I win again, another 10.

7701
05:04:48,620 --> 05:04:49,640
Is this how it works?

7702
05:04:50,100 --> 05:04:51,400
Hats, thank you for the super chat.

7703
05:04:51,500 --> 05:04:52,400
Thank you for the- Exactly!

7704
05:04:52,460 --> 05:04:52,940
Guys.

7705
05:04:53,200 --> 05:04:53,680
Guys.

7706
05:04:54,140 --> 05:04:55,960
It was all on purpose, guys.

7707
05:04:57,660 --> 05:04:59,000
It was all on purpose.

7708
05:04:59,800 --> 05:05:00,540
Look at that.

7709
05:05:01,260 --> 05:05:01,860
Easy.

7710
05:05:02,220 --> 05:05:04,440
Easiest 10 dollars of my life.

7711
05:05:11,340 --> 05:05:13,840
Easiest 10 dollars of my life.

7712
05:05:14,100 --> 05:05:15,600
It was fixed, guys.

7713
05:05:15,800 --> 05:05:18,520
I was here for the big payout.

7714
05:05:20,180 --> 05:05:22,480
I was here for the big payout, guys.

7715
05:05:25,340 --> 05:05:26,520
Actually, Reng.

7716
05:05:26,660 --> 05:05:27,700
Don't keep throwing.

7717
05:05:27,920 --> 05:05:29,920
I'm not saying I'm throwing.

7718
05:05:30,780 --> 05:05:31,380
Guys.

7719
05:05:31,840 --> 05:05:34,100
I'm not saying I'm throwing, guys.

7720
05:05:34,440 --> 05:05:35,720
You have no proof.

7721
05:05:36,180 --> 05:05:40,560
You have no proof that I fixed the match.

7722
05:05:40,820 --> 05:05:42,940
Except for me admitting that I did it.

7723
05:05:48,360 --> 05:05:49,800
Oh my god!

7724
05:05:49,880 --> 05:05:50,160
How?

7725
05:05:51,480 --> 05:05:53,200
How do we- Okay.

7726
05:05:53,540 --> 05:05:54,660
I'm gonna...

7727
05:05:55,780 --> 05:05:57,240
Okay, I'm not playing Mercy.

7728
05:05:57,680 --> 05:05:58,940
Has it started yet?

7729
05:05:58,980 --> 05:05:59,340
Soon!

7730
05:05:59,520 --> 05:06:00,320
Soon, TM!

7731
05:06:00,540 --> 05:06:00,960
Soon!

7732
05:06:01,460 --> 05:06:02,360
Bacon, damn!

7733
05:06:02,640 --> 05:06:04,120
Don't keep losing me capital.

7734
05:06:04,320 --> 05:06:06,680
Looks like the insurance won't be getting paid.

7735
05:06:07,420 --> 05:06:07,940
Soon!

7736
05:06:08,200 --> 05:06:08,520
Soon!

7737
05:06:08,700 --> 05:06:09,380
This is it.

7738
05:06:12,300 --> 05:06:13,220
Oh my god.

7739
05:06:13,260 --> 05:06:14,500
At least he's not an orb anymore.

7740
05:06:15,280 --> 05:06:16,820
Like, that's the best part.

7741
05:06:17,940 --> 05:06:18,620
There we go.

7742
05:06:19,140 --> 05:06:19,940
Oh, what?

7743
05:06:22,380 --> 05:06:23,260
That's my bad.

7744
05:06:27,360 --> 05:06:28,380
Where's the Rein?

7745
05:06:28,600 --> 05:06:30,220
Is that the Rein over there?

7746
05:06:32,440 --> 05:06:34,040
Where the fuck is that Rein?

7747
05:06:34,300 --> 05:06:35,340
Oh, there he is.

7748
05:06:35,820 --> 05:06:36,760
There we go.

7749
05:06:37,700 --> 05:06:40,280
Oh, that would be so sick if I hit those.

7750
05:06:43,560 --> 05:06:44,740
Alright, we're gonna go to Sigma.

7751
05:06:46,600 --> 05:06:48,020
I think it's Reng.

7752
05:06:48,040 --> 05:06:49,540
She's winning while losing.

7753
05:06:49,940 --> 05:06:51,440
Thank you for the super chat, Jinya.

7754
05:06:51,540 --> 05:06:52,300
Thank you, thank you.

7755
05:06:53,160 --> 05:06:53,900
I'll be fine.

7756
05:06:54,560 --> 05:06:56,460
I can stop whenever I want.

7757
05:06:57,920 --> 05:06:58,440
Guys.

7758
05:06:58,440 --> 05:07:01,600
I can stop playing Overwatch whenever I want, guys.

7759
05:07:03,040 --> 05:07:04,800
It's not an addiction.

7760
05:07:06,180 --> 05:07:08,360
I can stop whenever I want.

7761
05:07:08,480 --> 05:07:10,000
It's just... I just don't want to.

7762
05:07:13,420 --> 05:07:15,800
I feel like he has shatter.

7763
05:07:16,780 --> 05:07:17,840
Who woke him?

7764
05:07:21,470 --> 05:07:23,290
That Rein can die.

7765
05:07:23,370 --> 05:07:24,390
Who woke him?

7766
05:07:24,490 --> 05:07:24,810
Maybe later.

7767
05:07:31,720 --> 05:07:34,480
We'll find that win streak, so...

7768
05:07:35,080 --> 05:07:36,340
Guys, we'll find it.

7769
05:07:37,420 --> 05:07:38,280
I believe.

7770
05:07:39,160 --> 05:07:40,240
You're powered up.

7771
05:07:41,120 --> 05:07:41,640
See?

7772
05:07:43,540 --> 05:07:44,420
This is it!

7773
05:07:44,540 --> 05:07:45,160
This is where...

7774
05:07:45,720 --> 05:07:46,240
OOOOOOOH!

7775
05:07:54,180 --> 05:07:55,620
The Cask can die.

7776
05:07:57,500 --> 05:07:58,720
This was not it.

7777
05:07:59,900 --> 05:08:00,800
No, Mom.

7778
05:08:00,900 --> 05:08:02,340
I don't have a problem!

7779
05:08:10,290 --> 05:08:10,810
Okay.

7780
05:08:11,810 --> 05:08:12,330
Okay.

7781
05:08:12,990 --> 05:08:14,930
I'm farming my ult off this ride.

7782
05:08:15,570 --> 05:08:16,930
I still have a chance!

7783
05:08:16,930 --> 05:08:18,030
Oh my god.

7784
05:08:18,130 --> 05:08:19,390
Okay, we're actually throwing now.

7785
05:08:25,070 --> 05:08:27,290
We might actually be throwing now.

7786
05:08:27,870 --> 05:08:30,710
Ruben's ride is not known to be like...

7787
05:08:33,010 --> 05:08:35,550
It's not known to be something that...

7788
05:08:39,390 --> 05:08:40,310
Oh my god.

7789
05:08:44,500 --> 05:08:46,320
He keeps hit... he keeps waking him.

7790
05:08:46,320 --> 05:08:47,880
Oh god!

7791
05:08:48,640 --> 05:08:49,760
He's at the side!

7792
05:08:50,260 --> 05:08:50,420
Oh!

7793
05:08:51,620 --> 05:08:52,200
Stop!

7794
05:08:57,910 --> 05:08:58,490
Stop!

7795
05:08:58,690 --> 05:08:58,690
Stop!

7796
05:08:58,730 --> 05:08:59,250
Earthquakes!

7797
05:09:00,690 --> 05:09:03,070
Victoria is close, but not close.

7798
05:09:10,370 --> 05:09:10,950
Okay.

7799
05:09:10,950 --> 05:09:14,130
Sorry I used your win streak earlier.

7800
05:09:14,310 --> 05:09:15,670
If you can have it.

7801
05:09:17,090 --> 05:09:17,670
Bro!

7802
05:09:18,150 --> 05:09:21,830
Bro, do you think... cause I don't think...

7803
05:09:22,550 --> 05:09:23,870
That it was just insurance.

7804
05:09:23,950 --> 05:09:25,030
I was actually really scared.

7805
05:09:25,690 --> 05:09:28,010
No mom, I don't have a problem.

7806
05:09:28,710 --> 05:09:29,970
Gladstone, thank you for the super chat.

7807
05:09:30,050 --> 05:09:30,790
Thank you, thank you.

7808
05:09:30,830 --> 05:09:31,950
Jordan, thank you for the super chat.

7809
05:09:32,030 --> 05:09:32,890
Thank you, thank you.

7810
05:09:34,030 --> 05:09:34,390
Roy!

7811
05:09:34,390 --> 05:09:37,870
I'll search the globe, explore the depths of the ocean, we'll find the win streak.

7812
05:09:37,910 --> 05:09:38,290
Here we go.

7813
05:09:38,370 --> 05:09:38,970
This is it.

7814
05:09:39,050 --> 05:09:40,790
We're gonna discover the win streak right here.

7815
05:09:40,830 --> 05:09:41,670
We're starting the wins.

7816
05:09:41,730 --> 05:09:42,230
Right here.

7817
05:09:42,950 --> 05:09:44,050
Right here, right now.

7818
05:09:45,190 --> 05:09:45,870
This is it.

7819
05:09:46,850 --> 05:09:47,930
It's a flying car.

7820
05:09:48,030 --> 05:09:48,830
Oh shit, you're right.

7821
05:09:52,370 --> 05:09:52,910
Alright.

7822
05:09:53,530 --> 05:09:55,610
Just gonna casually...

7823
05:09:55,610 --> 05:09:57,110
Just gonna push.

7824
05:09:57,110 --> 05:09:57,270
Oh my god.

7825
05:09:57,610 --> 05:09:59,230
Oh he's so fucking good.

7826
05:10:00,990 --> 05:10:02,070
We'll be fine, right?

7827
05:10:04,770 --> 05:10:05,870
We'll be fine, right?

7828
05:10:07,510 --> 05:10:10,010
You're fucking... Oh my god!

7829
05:10:10,170 --> 05:10:11,290
Okay, not gonna lie.

7830
05:10:12,730 --> 05:10:13,610
Guys, guys.

7831
05:10:15,150 --> 05:10:16,750
Guys, I'm so scared.

7832
05:10:17,770 --> 05:10:19,210
I'm so scared.

7833
05:10:21,830 --> 05:10:22,130
I'm so scared.

7834
05:10:24,130 --> 05:10:25,390
That's a good question.

7835
05:10:28,710 --> 05:10:30,090
That's a good question.

7836
05:10:30,850 --> 05:10:31,370
Wow!

7837
05:10:32,470 --> 05:10:34,170
Well, I guess... No?

7838
05:10:34,430 --> 05:10:35,990
It was the answer all along.

7839
05:10:36,690 --> 05:10:37,610
Oh, goodbye.

7840
05:10:42,450 --> 05:10:45,960
I'm tired of this fight.

7841
05:10:48,360 --> 05:10:49,920
Junior, thank you for the super chat.

7842
05:10:50,040 --> 05:10:50,840
Thank you, thank you.

7843
05:10:50,840 --> 05:10:50,940
Thank you.

7844
05:10:53,440 --> 05:10:54,160
It's okay.

7845
05:10:54,880 --> 05:10:55,720
This is it.

7846
05:10:57,900 --> 05:10:59,540
Huge anti right there.

7847
05:10:59,900 --> 05:11:01,340
I told you that was it.

7848
05:11:03,920 --> 05:11:04,960
I told you that was it.

7849
05:11:04,960 --> 05:11:06,680
Why are they like in our spot?

7850
05:11:07,720 --> 05:11:08,760
Can we go run?

7851
05:11:10,620 --> 05:11:11,660
Holy shit!

7852
05:11:11,820 --> 05:11:12,160
Holy shit!

7853
05:11:12,260 --> 05:11:14,460
Our DPS is like...

7854
05:11:15,540 --> 05:11:16,060
Struggles.

7855
05:11:20,640 --> 05:11:21,160
Guys.

7856
05:11:21,260 --> 05:11:21,600
Guys.

7857
05:11:22,300 --> 05:11:23,120
Guys, I'm scared.

7858
05:11:23,420 --> 05:11:24,580
Kill this guy!

7859
05:11:24,860 --> 05:11:25,820
I'm so scared.

7860
05:11:27,900 --> 05:11:28,460
Guys.

7861
05:11:31,980 --> 05:11:33,180
He has shatter.

7862
05:11:33,660 --> 05:11:37,360
He 100% has shatter.

7863
05:11:37,360 --> 05:11:39,120
He 100% has shatter.

7864
05:11:39,260 --> 05:11:39,980
He's antied.

7865
05:11:40,640 --> 05:11:41,580
What do you mean?

7866
05:11:42,040 --> 05:11:43,280
Who's gonna do it?

7867
05:11:44,140 --> 05:11:45,380
Who's gonna do it?

7868
05:11:47,280 --> 05:11:48,380
Someone kill...

7869
05:11:48,380 --> 05:11:48,680
No!

7870
05:11:49,080 --> 05:11:49,640
Please!

7871
05:11:50,100 --> 05:11:51,000
Oh, there we go.

7872
05:11:56,480 --> 05:11:57,100
That's fine.

7873
05:12:00,800 --> 05:12:01,420
That's fine.

7874
05:12:02,220 --> 05:12:02,700
Oh!

7875
05:12:03,120 --> 05:12:03,760
Missed that.

7876
05:12:05,620 --> 05:12:07,260
There's no way he could charge.

7877
05:12:08,980 --> 05:12:11,660
Oh, why does that hit everyone but the ride?

7878
05:12:12,140 --> 05:12:14,480
Why does that hit everyone but the ride?

7879
05:12:17,520 --> 05:12:18,520
Oh, that's huge!

7880
05:12:19,620 --> 05:12:20,660
I'm gonna push the cart.

7881
05:12:21,120 --> 05:12:22,800
I didn't see it, but it looked huge.

7882
05:12:23,420 --> 05:12:24,960
These barrels are smoking.

7883
05:12:26,120 --> 05:12:26,660
That's it.

7884
05:12:27,340 --> 05:12:27,780
I told you.

7885
05:12:27,840 --> 05:12:29,320
I told you a winch would start one day.

7886
05:12:29,580 --> 05:12:30,380
I told you.

7887
05:12:31,340 --> 05:12:32,520
Guys, I know it's like...

7888
05:12:32,520 --> 05:12:34,640
I know we've been playing Overwatch for 5 hours now.

7889
05:12:34,760 --> 05:12:35,080
I know.

7890
05:12:35,220 --> 05:12:36,000
But like...

7891
05:12:36,000 --> 05:12:40,540
But I don't have a problem.

7892
05:12:44,740 --> 05:12:46,620
All I'm saying... I just...

7893
05:12:46,620 --> 05:12:47,800
I don't have a problem.

7894
05:12:53,420 --> 05:12:55,060
Oh my god, I saved his life.

7895
05:12:58,280 --> 05:12:59,280
Oh my...

7896
05:12:59,280 --> 05:13:01,380
Okay, that was actually a really...

7897
05:13:01,380 --> 05:13:02,760
Oh my... Okay, that was actually a really...

7898
05:13:02,760 --> 05:13:04,600
A really good anti.

7899
05:13:04,600 --> 05:13:04,920
A really good anti.

7900
05:13:06,580 --> 05:13:08,560
Okay, our Ashe is so fucked.

7901
05:13:10,660 --> 05:13:11,600
I have...

7902
05:13:11,600 --> 05:13:12,940
I think I have to go Lucio.

7903
05:13:13,400 --> 05:13:13,900
Unless...

7904
05:13:13,900 --> 05:13:14,640
Can we touch this?

7905
05:13:15,620 --> 05:13:16,880
We might be able to.

7906
05:13:21,590 --> 05:13:22,850
Oh, he's fucking...

7907
05:13:24,110 --> 05:13:25,570
Yeah, I don't think he's making it.

7908
05:13:25,570 --> 05:13:28,050
I don't think he's making it.

7909
05:13:28,110 --> 05:13:28,770
That's fine.

7910
05:13:28,830 --> 05:13:29,490
We push it pretty far.

7911
05:13:30,890 --> 05:13:31,590
It's fine.

7912
05:13:32,450 --> 05:13:33,150
It's fine.

7913
05:13:38,990 --> 05:13:39,910
It's so fine.

7914
05:13:40,170 --> 05:13:41,110
It's so fine.

7915
05:13:41,330 --> 05:13:42,050
I believe.

7916
05:13:45,670 --> 05:13:46,190
I believe.

7917
05:13:46,190 --> 05:13:46,370
This is it.

7918
05:13:54,380 --> 05:13:55,420
I believe.

7919
05:13:57,080 --> 05:13:58,540
This has to be it.

7920
05:13:58,700 --> 05:13:59,020
This has to be it.

7921
05:13:59,740 --> 05:14:01,900
You proved me wrong.

7922
05:14:02,080 --> 05:14:04,220
Guess you just got Lucio's...

7923
05:14:04,220 --> 05:14:04,980
Guess you just got Lucio's...

7924
05:14:04,980 --> 05:14:06,860
Don't say that!

7925
05:14:07,380 --> 05:14:07,740
Don't say that!

7926
05:14:07,880 --> 05:14:09,620
I'll be different.

7927
05:14:10,000 --> 05:14:11,240
I swear.

7928
05:14:17,400 --> 05:14:19,480
I swear.

7929
05:14:20,200 --> 05:14:21,920
I'll be different.

7930
05:14:23,700 --> 05:14:25,240
I'll just...

7931
05:14:25,240 --> 05:14:27,080
I'll just...

7932
05:14:27,080 --> 05:14:27,120
No!

7933
05:14:27,380 --> 05:14:28,760
Why are you on Brig?

7934
05:14:29,740 --> 05:14:31,180
I was gonna go Zenyatta.

7935
05:14:32,400 --> 05:14:34,240
It's not me.

7936
05:14:34,640 --> 05:14:36,440
I was climbing before.

7937
05:14:37,340 --> 05:14:38,840
It's not me.

7938
05:14:41,350 --> 05:14:43,660
I was climbing solo too.

7939
05:14:44,200 --> 05:14:45,580
It's not me.

7940
05:14:51,570 --> 05:14:53,740
It's everybody but me.

7941
05:15:00,160 --> 05:15:03,560
Guys, it's everybody but me.

7942
05:15:04,760 --> 05:15:05,680
Guys, it's everybody but me.

7943
05:15:05,680 --> 05:15:07,040
They always say that.

7944
05:15:10,560 --> 05:15:12,500
They always say that.

7945
05:15:12,560 --> 05:15:13,700
They always say that cause they're right.

7946
05:15:14,360 --> 05:15:15,620
They always say that cause they're right.

7947
05:15:15,620 --> 05:15:17,200
Holy shit.

7948
05:15:18,620 --> 05:15:20,480
Oh, that's not good.

7949
05:15:22,480 --> 05:15:24,520
Guys, there's a Rein above.

7950
05:15:24,800 --> 05:15:24,920
Guys, there's a Rein above.

7951
05:15:24,920 --> 05:15:25,600
And I'm scared!

7952
05:15:26,620 --> 05:15:28,000
I'm so scared!

7953
05:15:30,120 --> 05:15:31,340
I'm so scared!

7954
05:15:31,780 --> 05:15:31,800
I'm so scared!

7955
05:15:37,380 --> 05:15:39,020
Ana's on our high ground.

7956
05:15:39,240 --> 05:15:39,540
Yeah.

7957
05:15:39,640 --> 05:15:40,720
I got two.

7958
05:15:43,660 --> 05:15:44,840
I'm on my way.

7959
05:15:45,900 --> 05:15:46,800
I swear.

7960
05:15:48,660 --> 05:15:49,620
Oh no.

7961
05:15:49,940 --> 05:15:50,720
Oh no.

7962
05:15:50,760 --> 05:15:51,500
I missed the nade.

7963
05:15:52,160 --> 05:15:53,380
And I have to reload.

7964
05:15:56,200 --> 05:15:57,680
I told you.

7965
05:15:57,800 --> 05:15:58,120
Woah!

7966
05:16:01,460 --> 05:16:02,340
Okay, there you go.

7967
05:16:02,380 --> 05:16:02,600
We're five.

7968
05:16:04,240 --> 05:16:06,100
Yeah, she said next team, not next.

7969
05:16:06,240 --> 05:16:06,700
Guys, I might have messed up.

7970
05:16:08,020 --> 05:16:09,060
No, you have it!

7971
05:16:09,240 --> 05:16:10,240
No, you have it!

7972
05:16:11,100 --> 05:16:11,540
No!

7973
05:16:11,960 --> 05:16:13,080
Get back here!

7974
05:16:13,120 --> 05:16:14,180
You're blowing me up!

7975
05:16:19,370 --> 05:16:19,970
That's fine.

7976
05:16:20,270 --> 05:16:20,710
Guys!

7977
05:16:23,570 --> 05:16:24,010
Stop!

7978
05:16:25,370 --> 05:16:26,890
I don't have heals!

7979
05:16:29,030 --> 05:16:31,150
You'll have to try harder than that.

7980
05:16:31,370 --> 05:16:32,450
Can we back up a little bit?

7981
05:16:32,490 --> 05:16:33,450
I need to recharge my shield.

7982
05:16:34,570 --> 05:16:35,170
Please.

7983
05:16:35,690 --> 05:16:36,290
Please.

7984
05:16:36,550 --> 05:16:37,810
I'm so low.

7985
05:16:38,570 --> 05:16:40,130
I'm so far away.

7986
05:16:41,410 --> 05:16:42,010
Please.

7987
05:16:44,210 --> 05:16:45,250
Please, guys.

7988
05:16:47,870 --> 05:16:49,050
Yo, I'm backing up.

7989
05:16:49,090 --> 05:16:49,650
Yo, back up.

7990
05:16:52,330 --> 05:16:54,510
Oh, he definitely has shatter, though.

7991
05:16:55,110 --> 05:16:57,130
He 100% has it.

7992
05:16:58,410 --> 05:17:00,010
He definitely has it.

7993
05:17:00,050 --> 05:17:01,210
I feel the shatter.

7994
05:17:02,350 --> 05:17:03,790
I feel it right now.

7995
05:17:03,790 --> 05:17:04,170
I feel it right here.

7996
05:17:07,470 --> 05:17:09,710
Oh my god!

7997
05:17:11,910 --> 05:17:13,270
There it is!

7998
05:17:13,690 --> 05:17:16,310
There it is!

7999
05:17:16,710 --> 05:17:18,570
There it is!

8000
05:17:20,230 --> 05:17:21,730
There it is!

8001
05:17:22,090 --> 05:17:22,390
There it is!

8002
05:17:22,390 --> 05:17:22,950
Whoop!

8003
05:17:23,330 --> 05:17:24,170
Whoop!

8004
05:17:24,390 --> 05:17:26,810
There it is!

8005
05:17:29,330 --> 05:17:30,170
Alright.

8006
05:17:30,630 --> 05:17:31,910
We recon test.

8007
05:17:31,990 --> 05:17:32,450
We recon test.

8008
05:17:32,570 --> 05:17:33,130
100%.

8009
05:17:34,030 --> 05:17:34,510
Alright.

8010
05:17:36,410 --> 05:17:36,890
Alright.

8011
05:17:37,250 --> 05:17:38,830
There's a reining here, though.

8012
05:17:41,930 --> 05:17:42,410
Ah!

8013
05:17:42,530 --> 05:17:42,870
Heal!

8014
05:17:43,030 --> 05:17:43,510
Heal!

8015
05:17:43,550 --> 05:17:43,750
Heal!

8016
05:17:44,650 --> 05:17:45,130
Bye.

8017
05:17:51,030 --> 05:17:52,470
Yo, what is their Ana doing?

8018
05:17:53,590 --> 05:17:55,110
Wait, there's an Ana right here.

8019
05:17:55,270 --> 05:17:55,390
Wait, there's an Ana right here.

8020
05:17:58,770 --> 05:18:00,070
I'm gonna go for the Soldier.

8021
05:18:01,030 --> 05:18:03,070
There's literally an Ana in our spawn.

8022
05:18:03,070 --> 05:18:03,730
Nice.

8023
05:18:03,910 --> 05:18:05,130
Like, what?

8024
05:18:05,770 --> 05:18:07,850
Is there Ana still alive back there?

8025
05:18:08,090 --> 05:18:09,510
Where the fuck did the Ana go?

8026
05:18:14,320 --> 05:18:17,840
I'm like, a bit scared about where the Ana is.

8027
05:18:19,880 --> 05:18:20,460
Like...

8028
05:18:20,460 --> 05:18:20,580
Like...

8029
05:18:20,580 --> 05:18:20,580
I'm here.

8030
05:18:21,160 --> 05:18:21,940
Keep fighting.

8031
05:18:23,640 --> 05:18:24,540
Take this.

8032
05:18:25,040 --> 05:18:25,620
Like...

8033
05:18:27,180 --> 05:18:28,880
I'm defending red.

8034
05:18:29,080 --> 05:18:29,340
Wait!

8035
05:18:29,460 --> 05:18:30,200
Ana's behind!

8036
05:18:31,380 --> 05:18:33,280
There's an Ana still back there?

8037
05:18:33,280 --> 05:18:33,780
Okay.

8038
05:18:39,290 --> 05:18:40,730
Did we get the Ana?

8039
05:18:44,200 --> 05:18:45,960
Is the Ana still there?

8040
05:18:46,360 --> 05:18:46,840
I'm stuck.

8041
05:18:49,600 --> 05:18:51,400
Bro, is the Ana still...

8042
05:18:53,060 --> 05:18:55,140
Bro, the Ana still there!

8043
05:18:57,140 --> 05:18:58,860
Bro, get the fuck out!

8044
05:19:02,950 --> 05:19:03,690
What the fuck?

8045
05:19:03,990 --> 05:19:04,530
Leave!

8046
05:19:07,350 --> 05:19:08,490
Leave, Rachel.

8047
05:19:08,490 --> 05:19:09,650
She's throwing...

8048
05:19:12,230 --> 05:19:12,790
Like...

8049
05:19:12,790 --> 05:19:14,890
They had to still...

8050
05:19:16,950 --> 05:19:18,070
Guys, I won.

8051
05:19:19,710 --> 05:19:21,330
I fucking knew it, guys.

8052
05:19:22,110 --> 05:19:24,270
Guys, that's all it took, guys.

8053
05:19:25,550 --> 05:19:26,110
Expect...

8054
05:19:26,110 --> 05:19:26,650
Alright, guys.

8055
05:19:26,770 --> 05:19:27,230
It's alright.

8056
05:19:32,350 --> 05:19:33,470
Oh, shit.

8057
05:19:33,710 --> 05:19:34,930
What practice range?

8058
05:19:35,330 --> 05:19:36,650
I don't beat practice range!

8059
05:19:38,830 --> 05:19:40,210
I mean, it's three minutes.

8060
05:19:40,230 --> 05:19:40,770
It's fine.

8061
05:19:40,870 --> 05:19:41,530
It's three minutes.

8062
05:19:41,930 --> 05:19:43,070
Oh my god.

8063
05:19:43,730 --> 05:19:47,090
Alright, we're gonna chill for three minutes, guys.

8064
05:19:47,230 --> 05:19:47,910
A little reset.

8065
05:19:48,330 --> 05:19:49,130
This is it.

8066
05:19:49,270 --> 05:19:52,670
On the sixth hour, we're gonna get our masters.

8067
05:19:52,770 --> 05:19:53,170
Here.

8068
05:19:53,630 --> 05:19:54,790
On the sixth hour.

8069
05:19:56,150 --> 05:19:58,450
Yeah, she got...

8070
05:19:58,450 --> 05:20:00,950
The enemy Rein could not fucking heal.

8071
05:20:02,390 --> 05:20:06,550
The enemy Rein got fucked over because he didn't have an Ana with him.

8072
05:20:07,030 --> 05:20:07,550
Alright.

8073
05:20:07,810 --> 05:20:08,470
It's fine.

8074
05:20:09,190 --> 05:20:09,990
It's fine.

8075
05:20:10,510 --> 05:20:11,070
Guys.

8076
05:20:12,470 --> 05:20:13,350
We'll be okay.

8077
05:20:14,030 --> 05:20:15,510
This is the win streak.

8078
05:20:16,730 --> 05:20:20,150
The rank up for our guest bar hasn't gone up.

8079
05:20:20,790 --> 05:20:21,350
Guys!

8080
05:20:21,510 --> 05:20:21,950
Guys!

8081
05:20:21,990 --> 05:20:22,290
Yes.

8082
05:20:22,310 --> 05:20:23,570
It was a visual bug.

8083
05:20:23,930 --> 05:20:24,490
Guys.

8084
05:20:24,930 --> 05:20:26,150
A visual bug.

8085
05:20:26,230 --> 05:20:30,230
You might think that the rank up bar has not gone up at all.

8086
05:20:30,410 --> 05:20:32,110
Like, not even once.

8087
05:20:32,110 --> 05:20:34,370
Throughout the last five and a half hours.

8088
05:20:34,650 --> 05:20:37,250
But it was merely just a visual bug.

8089
05:20:37,470 --> 05:20:39,250
And this is where it all changes.

8090
05:20:41,090 --> 05:20:43,990
This is exactly where everything changes here.

8091
05:20:44,490 --> 05:20:45,350
Like, look at that.

8092
05:20:45,430 --> 05:20:52,050
If I can hit those headies right here as Cassidy's, I can hit those headies on my sleep dart.

8093
05:20:52,450 --> 05:20:52,890
Guys.

8094
05:20:52,990 --> 05:20:53,730
This is it.

8095
05:20:57,590 --> 05:20:58,350
Right here.

8096
05:21:00,050 --> 05:21:00,490
Uh...

8097
05:21:00,490 --> 05:21:01,750
Blarious, thank you for the super chat.

8098
05:21:01,810 --> 05:21:02,070
Thank you.

8099
05:21:02,250 --> 05:21:04,310
I can stop whenever I want.

8100
05:21:04,730 --> 05:21:05,170
Chat.

8101
05:21:05,930 --> 05:21:07,690
I can stop whenever I want.

8102
05:21:07,830 --> 05:21:08,210
Guys.

8103
05:21:09,930 --> 05:21:11,070
It's just that easy.

8104
05:21:11,830 --> 05:21:12,950
I can stop here.

8105
05:21:13,690 --> 05:21:15,130
Your aim is cracked.

8106
05:21:15,430 --> 05:21:16,470
I know, right?

8107
05:21:16,930 --> 05:21:17,610
I know.

8108
05:21:17,690 --> 05:21:19,410
And it translates well in game too.

8109
05:21:24,170 --> 05:21:25,470
Ormido, thank you for the super chat.

8110
05:21:25,530 --> 05:21:25,770
Thank you.

8111
05:21:27,910 --> 05:21:29,610
Uh... Keep it up, Doki.

8112
05:21:29,730 --> 05:21:31,010
The marathon...

8113
05:21:31,010 --> 05:21:34,870
The win streak begins when the better teams go to bed.

8114
05:21:35,170 --> 05:21:37,070
I am the better team!

8115
05:21:37,590 --> 05:21:39,310
I'm the better healer!

8116
05:21:39,450 --> 05:21:40,570
I swear!

8117
05:21:42,330 --> 05:21:43,950
I'm the better healer!

8118
05:21:44,530 --> 05:21:45,790
It's just not me.

8119
05:21:45,910 --> 05:21:46,590
It's not me.

8120
05:21:46,910 --> 05:21:47,470
Guys.

8121
05:21:47,550 --> 05:21:49,190
It's absolutely not me.

8122
05:21:49,350 --> 05:21:52,210
Look at those headshots I'm taking against bots.

8123
05:21:52,850 --> 05:21:53,750
Look at that.

8124
05:21:54,350 --> 05:21:55,630
Look at these flicks.

8125
05:21:56,290 --> 05:21:57,110
Boom, boom.

8126
05:21:57,370 --> 05:21:58,210
Flick, flick, flick.

8127
05:21:58,910 --> 05:21:59,650
Come on.

8128
05:22:00,370 --> 05:22:01,170
Look at that.

8129
05:22:01,290 --> 05:22:01,910
And then...

8130
05:22:02,870 --> 05:22:03,730
Come on.

8131
05:22:03,770 --> 05:22:05,670
Get an Anakin that can do that.

8132
05:22:06,450 --> 05:22:07,510
Go, Fio.

8133
05:22:08,730 --> 05:22:10,910
Like, are you trying to say these flicks?

8134
05:22:13,130 --> 05:22:15,290
These flicks are causing me to lose?

8135
05:22:17,270 --> 05:22:21,830
It's just unfortunate that every time I lose, I get a bad player on my team.

8136
05:22:23,630 --> 05:22:26,130
What does each game have in common?

8137
05:22:26,730 --> 05:22:27,510
Not me.

8138
05:22:28,010 --> 05:22:30,110
I play different healers.

8139
05:22:31,190 --> 05:22:32,750
Because I can flex.

8140
05:22:35,170 --> 05:22:35,770
Like, look at that.

8141
05:22:35,870 --> 05:22:36,990
I haven't missed a single shot.

8142
05:22:38,850 --> 05:22:39,610
There we go.

8143
05:22:39,890 --> 05:22:40,950
I think we're ready.

8144
05:22:42,630 --> 05:22:43,470
This is it.

8145
05:22:43,810 --> 05:22:44,810
There's no way.

8146
05:22:45,810 --> 05:22:47,150
Guys, there's no way.

8147
05:22:47,470 --> 05:22:47,910
.

8148
05:22:48,670 --> 05:22:49,190
.

8149
05:22:52,270 --> 05:22:54,530
This will 100% carry over.

8150
05:22:55,050 --> 05:22:55,570
.

8151
05:22:58,770 --> 05:22:59,290
100%.

8152
05:22:59,290 --> 05:23:00,490
This will carry over.

8153
05:23:01,910 --> 05:23:02,650
You know what?

8154
05:23:03,070 --> 05:23:04,370
I know the issue.

8155
05:23:05,170 --> 05:23:09,510
We just need a third player to play DPS, so we have all roles accounted for.

8156
05:23:13,990 --> 05:23:15,930
All I'm saying...

8157
05:23:17,830 --> 05:23:24,450
If we have a third player, we will have a DPS player that we can count on.

8158
05:23:24,630 --> 05:23:27,370
And then I have a tank player that I can count on.

8159
05:23:27,430 --> 05:23:28,390
And then there's me.

8160
05:23:28,470 --> 05:23:29,550
I can count on myself.

8161
05:23:30,170 --> 05:23:30,890
You know?

8162
05:23:31,810 --> 05:23:32,770
I can't...

8163
05:23:32,770 --> 05:23:33,890
Excuse me, silly kitty.

8164
05:23:34,130 --> 05:23:34,770
I can't...

8165
05:23:35,170 --> 05:23:36,830
I can count on myself, you know?

8166
05:23:37,370 --> 05:23:37,550
.

8167
05:23:39,070 --> 05:23:40,230
Boy, thank you for things.

8168
05:23:41,350 --> 05:23:41,570
.

8169
05:23:44,530 --> 05:23:44,950
300!

8170
05:23:46,350 --> 05:23:47,130
This is it.

8171
05:23:47,890 --> 05:23:48,610
This is it.

8172
05:23:49,490 --> 05:23:50,630
We can do this, guys.

8173
05:23:50,970 --> 05:23:52,610
You have it private for friends too?

8174
05:23:52,990 --> 05:23:53,310
.

8175
05:23:53,310 --> 05:23:54,030
.

8176
05:23:54,030 --> 05:24:01,090
I don't think I'm in range.

8177
05:24:01,310 --> 05:24:01,730
.

8178
05:24:01,730 --> 05:24:02,350
.

8179
05:24:06,150 --> 05:24:06,930
.

8180
05:24:06,930 --> 05:24:06,950
.

8181
05:24:06,950 --> 05:24:06,970
.

8182
05:24:06,970 --> 05:24:07,510
.

8183
05:24:07,510 --> 05:24:07,750
.

8184
05:24:07,750 --> 05:24:07,870
.

8185
05:24:07,870 --> 05:24:08,670
.

8186
05:24:08,670 --> 05:24:08,690
.

8187
05:24:08,690 --> 05:24:08,750
.

8188
05:24:14,010 --> 05:24:14,790
.

8189
05:24:20,330 --> 05:24:21,110
.

8190
05:24:21,110 --> 05:24:21,890
Oh my god, that's hilarious.

8191
05:24:22,110 --> 05:24:22,330
.

8192
05:24:23,450 --> 05:24:26,030
That is why we haven't succeeded.

8193
05:24:26,330 --> 05:24:26,650
.

8194
05:24:26,650 --> 05:24:29,070
It has to be it.

8195
05:24:29,490 --> 05:24:30,350
Like, what?

8196
05:24:31,030 --> 05:24:32,070
Jesus Christ.

8197
05:24:32,690 --> 05:24:33,270
.

8198
05:24:34,750 --> 05:24:35,350
No!

8199
05:24:35,710 --> 05:24:36,790
The gold Caracoo!

8200
05:24:37,790 --> 05:24:37,990
.

8201
05:24:39,370 --> 05:24:40,850
What the fuck?

8202
05:24:40,990 --> 05:24:41,430
Okay.

8203
05:24:41,750 --> 05:24:42,350
.

8204
05:24:44,870 --> 05:24:45,470
Okay.

8205
05:24:45,650 --> 05:24:46,210
The rez.

8206
05:24:46,330 --> 05:24:47,090
They got the rez off.

8207
05:24:47,290 --> 05:24:47,890
.

8208
05:24:47,890 --> 05:24:47,970
.

8209
05:24:51,430 --> 05:24:51,990
.

8210
05:24:57,790 --> 05:24:58,350
.

8211
05:24:58,350 --> 05:24:58,370
.

8212
05:24:58,970 --> 05:24:59,530
.

8213
05:24:59,530 --> 05:24:59,550
.

8214
05:24:59,550 --> 05:24:59,630
.

8215
05:24:59,630 --> 05:24:59,650
.

8216
05:24:59,650 --> 05:25:00,230
.

8217
05:25:00,230 --> 05:25:00,510
.

8218
05:25:00,510 --> 05:25:01,170
.

8219
05:25:01,170 --> 05:25:01,650
What the fuck is that?

8220
05:25:01,850 --> 05:25:02,230
.

8221
05:25:03,050 --> 05:25:03,490
.

8222
05:25:06,390 --> 05:25:06,830
Nope.

8223
05:25:09,350 --> 05:25:11,470
That was an insane hook.

8224
05:25:11,610 --> 05:25:12,390
Holy shit.

8225
05:25:12,550 --> 05:25:12,890
.

8226
05:25:13,770 --> 05:25:14,850
That hook was insane.

8227
05:25:15,370 --> 05:25:15,590
.

8228
05:25:18,610 --> 05:25:19,810
See those shots?

8229
05:25:20,770 --> 05:25:21,470
Look at that.

8230
05:25:21,650 --> 05:25:23,090
And you're trying to say I'm the problem.

8231
05:25:23,910 --> 05:25:25,270
Don't look at my sleep darts though.

8232
05:25:26,010 --> 05:25:27,890
It says 0% sleep dart accuracy.

8233
05:25:27,910 --> 05:25:29,210
It's because I haven't sleep darted yet.

8234
05:25:29,550 --> 05:25:29,990
.

8235
05:25:29,990 --> 05:25:30,150
.

8236
05:25:30,150 --> 05:25:30,370
Not yet.

8237
05:25:31,170 --> 05:25:32,110
Just so you know.

8238
05:25:32,530 --> 05:25:33,790
No.

8239
05:25:34,090 --> 05:25:34,290
.

8240
05:25:36,070 --> 05:25:36,870
Alright.

8241
05:25:37,190 --> 05:25:37,650
We're 5?

8242
05:25:38,050 --> 05:25:38,630
.

8243
05:25:40,850 --> 05:25:45,330
Dude look, Mercy alive because of me .

8244
05:25:45,330 --> 05:25:45,350
.

8245
05:25:49,790 --> 05:25:52,050
Here I going to hit .

8246
05:25:52,050 --> 05:25:52,770
.

8247
05:25:58,340 --> 05:25:59,940
Called it.

8248
05:26:00,080 --> 05:26:00,580
.

8249
05:26:03,420 --> 05:26:04,580
I'm not the problem.

8250
05:26:05,680 --> 05:26:07,780
I told you I wasn't the problem.

8251
05:26:10,540 --> 05:26:18,330
Oh my god, it was so unfortunate that I hit that shot, but then he just took too much damage, you know?

8252
05:26:22,350 --> 05:26:25,390
All I'm saying, he took too much damage.

8253
05:26:29,950 --> 05:26:32,210
We were not gonna win this anyway!

8254
05:26:35,730 --> 05:26:39,410
Content Nate, is this pre-recorded?

8255
05:26:39,790 --> 05:26:46,690
It was just unfortunate that, you know, the Genji took so much damage that like...

8256
05:26:47,530 --> 05:26:53,490
The Genji took so much damage that like, I just could not heal the damage there, you know?

8257
05:26:53,490 --> 05:26:54,050
You know?

8258
05:26:57,450 --> 05:26:59,650
They're gonna use six cooldowns, and then you guys will know.

8259
05:27:02,010 --> 05:27:02,930
He's doing things.

8260
05:27:03,470 --> 05:27:04,710
Guys, I think he's dead.

8261
05:27:06,190 --> 05:27:07,270
It's okay, it's okay, still one.

8262
05:27:07,310 --> 05:27:07,670
We'll still win.

8263
05:27:10,790 --> 05:27:11,510
Oh god.

8264
05:27:12,530 --> 05:27:13,430
Oh god, we're five.

8265
05:27:14,990 --> 05:27:15,990
Oh, we're so five.

8266
05:27:16,710 --> 05:27:18,030
It's okay, I got the point though.

8267
05:27:18,250 --> 05:27:18,990
We're still five.

8268
05:27:19,730 --> 05:27:20,710
Can you touch him?

8269
05:27:25,620 --> 05:27:26,800
He needs five points.

8270
05:27:27,620 --> 05:27:28,480
There you go.

8271
05:27:28,560 --> 05:27:28,780
I'm gonna go.

8272
05:27:28,800 --> 05:27:32,000
I thought staying in the cage would keep me safe, but it didn't.

8273
05:27:32,300 --> 05:27:37,280
Guys, look at that 20%... look at that 80% sleep dart accuracy.

8274
05:27:38,220 --> 05:27:39,400
Guys, look at that.

8275
05:27:39,960 --> 05:27:41,180
You guys don't believe me?

8276
05:27:41,300 --> 05:27:41,800
Don't worry.

8277
05:27:45,520 --> 05:27:47,200
Is that what she said?

8278
05:27:48,420 --> 05:27:48,860
Don't worry.

8279
05:27:48,980 --> 05:27:50,160
I mean, it could be what she said.

8280
05:27:50,800 --> 05:27:51,360
Don't worry.

8281
05:27:51,860 --> 05:27:52,740
Watch this.

8282
05:27:53,740 --> 05:27:54,720
That's a medium one too.

8283
05:27:56,420 --> 05:27:57,620
Okay, give me a sec.

8284
05:27:58,680 --> 05:27:59,320
80%.

8285
05:27:59,320 --> 05:28:00,800
I'm sorry.

8286
05:28:01,380 --> 05:28:02,200
Don't be.

8287
05:28:02,560 --> 05:28:03,560
Give me a sec.

8288
05:28:03,620 --> 05:28:04,440
Oh my gosh.

8289
05:28:05,080 --> 05:28:08,000
80% sleep dart accuracy.

8290
05:28:10,120 --> 05:28:11,580
Oh shit, wait.

8291
05:28:12,160 --> 05:28:15,900
Five, four, three, two, one.

8292
05:28:17,140 --> 05:28:18,420
Round two.

8293
05:28:18,780 --> 05:28:20,100
Capture the objective.

8294
05:28:20,120 --> 05:28:21,440
Shit, guys, I'm not throwing.

8295
05:28:23,200 --> 05:28:24,480
We won't throw.

8296
05:28:26,300 --> 05:28:27,600
Guys, I'm not throwing.

8297
05:28:27,600 --> 05:28:30,280
Guys, guys, I purposely wanted to be last.

8298
05:28:30,780 --> 05:28:32,340
To go down here last.

8299
05:28:36,410 --> 05:28:36,810
Oh yeah.

8300
05:28:39,510 --> 05:28:41,130
Oh my god, 30% now.

8301
05:28:42,330 --> 05:28:43,090
Jesus Christ.

8302
05:28:43,550 --> 05:28:44,390
This is a lot.

8303
05:28:44,470 --> 05:28:45,170
This is a lot.

8304
05:28:45,210 --> 05:28:45,890
This is a lot.

8305
05:28:46,530 --> 05:28:47,670
This is a lot.

8306
05:28:48,070 --> 05:28:50,030
Thank you.

8307
05:28:50,030 --> 05:28:50,790
I try my best.

8308
05:28:51,310 --> 05:28:53,510
My goal every day when I walk out of my house.

8309
05:28:53,950 --> 05:28:55,290
Maybe not when I walk out of my house.

8310
05:28:55,290 --> 05:28:55,770
There was...

8311
05:28:55,770 --> 05:28:57,070
You get what I mean.

8312
05:28:57,230 --> 05:28:59,110
There was a lot of things going on.

8313
05:28:59,110 --> 05:29:00,070
That's right.

8314
05:29:01,390 --> 05:29:01,870
80%.

8315
05:29:01,870 --> 05:29:02,490
That's right.

8316
05:29:02,590 --> 05:29:04,770
It went up 82%.

8317
05:29:04,770 --> 05:29:06,730
That's fucking crazy.

8318
05:29:07,510 --> 05:29:08,330
You're not a grump.

8319
05:29:09,650 --> 05:29:13,710
Okay, he is.

8320
05:29:14,170 --> 05:29:15,430
Yeah, I was gonna say.

8321
05:29:15,470 --> 05:29:16,450
There's no way.

8322
05:29:16,630 --> 05:29:18,930
You're the actual smartest MAGA player right there.

8323
05:29:18,990 --> 05:29:19,650
That's crazy.

8324
05:29:19,650 --> 05:29:21,130
There's no way I was gonna say.

8325
05:29:25,470 --> 05:29:25,950
Please.

8326
05:29:26,630 --> 05:29:27,370
I'm scared.

8327
05:29:30,930 --> 05:29:32,530
Look, I knew I hit those.

8328
05:29:34,890 --> 05:29:36,030
Thank you for it.

8329
05:29:37,890 --> 05:29:39,030
What the fuck?

8330
05:29:39,690 --> 05:29:40,910
Oh my god.

8331
05:29:40,970 --> 05:29:41,230
You're good.

8332
05:29:41,570 --> 05:29:43,910
Oh, I am not good.

8333
05:29:45,050 --> 05:29:46,970
Oh, there's too many things.

8334
05:29:47,950 --> 05:29:50,010
Too many things on my screen.

8335
05:29:50,930 --> 05:29:51,530
You know what we do have?

8336
05:29:52,850 --> 05:29:56,570
There's too many things going on.

8337
05:29:57,430 --> 05:29:58,330
It's over.

8338
05:29:58,750 --> 05:29:59,930
I live these though.

8339
05:29:59,930 --> 05:30:00,350
All right.

8340
05:30:00,610 --> 05:30:01,010
Nice.

8341
05:30:01,150 --> 05:30:01,670
I'm at...

8342
05:30:01,670 --> 05:30:02,710
Oh my god.

8343
05:30:02,730 --> 05:30:03,290
I'm at 85.

8344
05:30:03,730 --> 05:30:05,530
Did you see it?

8345
05:30:06,950 --> 05:30:08,690
I'm at 85% now.

8346
05:30:10,490 --> 05:30:10,890
85.

8347
05:30:13,270 --> 05:30:14,070
Holy shit.

8348
05:30:18,090 --> 05:30:19,390
We can keep going.

8349
05:30:20,050 --> 05:30:20,870
That's you right now.

8350
05:30:21,330 --> 05:30:22,630
We can keep going higher.

8351
05:30:25,030 --> 05:30:26,250
Wait, this one is going easy.

8352
05:30:26,630 --> 05:30:27,030
Oh.

8353
05:30:27,030 --> 05:30:27,490
That one.

8354
05:30:27,590 --> 05:30:28,350
That one.

8355
05:30:28,350 --> 05:30:28,370
Yeah.

8356
05:30:28,370 --> 05:30:28,670
That one.

8357
05:30:28,690 --> 05:30:28,770
Yeah.

8358
05:30:28,810 --> 05:30:28,910
That one.

8359
05:30:28,970 --> 05:30:29,030
Yeah.

8360
05:30:29,110 --> 05:30:29,250
Yeah.

8361
05:30:29,250 --> 05:30:29,290
Yeah.

8362
05:30:29,290 --> 05:30:29,310
Yeah.

8363
05:30:29,310 --> 05:30:29,450
Yeah.

8364
05:30:29,450 --> 05:30:29,850
Yeah.

8365
05:30:33,250 --> 05:30:34,350
Oh, my God.

8366
05:30:35,050 --> 05:30:35,650
Oh, my God.

8367
05:30:35,650 --> 05:30:35,690
Oh, my God.

8368
05:30:35,710 --> 05:30:36,210
Oh, my God.

8369
05:30:37,810 --> 05:30:38,310
Guys.

8370
05:30:43,230 --> 05:30:45,950
Guys, our mercy's fucked.

8371
05:30:47,110 --> 05:30:48,270
Jk, I'm gamer.

8372
05:30:48,470 --> 05:30:49,190
Oh, my God.

8373
05:30:49,210 --> 05:30:49,490
You're crazy.

8374
05:30:49,610 --> 05:30:50,130
You're actually crazy.

8375
05:30:50,870 --> 05:30:52,490
Okay, I can't game anymore.

8376
05:30:54,050 --> 05:30:55,670
I can't game anymore.

8377
05:30:55,790 --> 05:30:57,050
Someone, please help Ruben.

8378
05:30:57,270 --> 05:30:58,050
Genji, up top.

8379
05:30:58,250 --> 05:30:59,830
Genji definitely did not like this.

8380
05:31:04,650 --> 05:31:05,510
There's no way.

8381
05:31:06,590 --> 05:31:09,270
There's no way the Genji is gonna harass me still.

8382
05:31:13,090 --> 05:31:13,930
There's no way.

8383
05:31:13,950 --> 05:31:14,790
Where is the Genji?

8384
05:31:14,910 --> 05:31:15,750
I'm so scared.

8385
05:31:19,650 --> 05:31:20,550
Leave me alone!

8386
05:31:22,190 --> 05:31:23,530
See, I told you.

8387
05:31:23,590 --> 05:31:24,110
There's no way.

8388
05:31:28,290 --> 05:31:28,950
We're okay.

8389
05:31:30,210 --> 05:31:32,170
The Genji player gets so annoying.

8390
05:31:34,310 --> 05:31:35,770
Oh, he's definitely gonna have cage.

8391
05:31:36,050 --> 05:31:38,090
I feel like I should swap to Kiriko though.

8392
05:31:39,130 --> 05:31:41,670
I really wanna play Zenyatta, but we have Mercy.

8393
05:31:42,050 --> 05:31:42,770
So you're not...

8394
05:31:42,770 --> 05:31:45,650
What I've learned is that you're not supposed to...

8395
05:31:47,330 --> 05:31:48,030
Okay.

8396
05:31:48,030 --> 05:31:48,130
Oh.

8397
05:31:49,450 --> 05:31:51,970
Oh, this is... This is bad.

8398
05:31:52,430 --> 05:31:55,370
This is... Okay.

8399
05:31:55,850 --> 05:31:56,910
This is...

8400
05:31:57,750 --> 05:31:59,910
Why were they all in the cage?

8401
05:32:05,750 --> 05:32:09,530
Why were they all in the fucking cage?

8402
05:32:10,070 --> 05:32:10,770
Why?

8403
05:32:13,330 --> 05:32:14,030
Okay.

8404
05:32:15,750 --> 05:32:18,810
What the... The thing is...

8405
05:32:18,810 --> 05:32:20,830
More people ran in.

8406
05:32:24,470 --> 05:32:26,670
They wanted to be part of the fun.

8407
05:32:28,550 --> 05:32:29,830
Where's the content?

8408
05:32:30,910 --> 05:32:31,630
Alright.

8409
05:32:31,830 --> 05:32:32,470
It's time.

8410
05:32:33,470 --> 05:32:35,410
When all else fails, it's Kiriko time.

8411
05:32:35,730 --> 05:32:37,290
Kiriko is always the backup.

8412
05:32:38,610 --> 05:32:39,270
This is it.

8413
05:32:40,050 --> 05:32:44,210
Kiriko is always the... If everything fails, we go Kiriko.

8414
05:32:49,120 --> 05:32:49,820
It's okay.

8415
05:32:49,960 --> 05:32:51,100
This is our map.

8416
05:32:51,240 --> 05:32:52,780
This has to be our map, right?

8417
05:32:53,740 --> 05:32:54,260
Right?

8418
05:32:56,040 --> 05:32:56,560
Yeah?

8419
05:32:59,580 --> 05:33:00,100
Yeah?

8420
05:33:00,100 --> 05:33:00,520
Yeah?

8421
05:33:04,800 --> 05:33:06,200
It's in five hours?

8422
05:33:07,200 --> 05:33:07,680
Whoa.

8423
05:33:09,980 --> 05:33:10,500
Whoa.

8424
05:33:10,500 --> 05:33:11,400
Five hours?

8425
05:33:11,620 --> 05:33:14,460
It would be a shame if we went beyond that.

8426
05:33:15,440 --> 05:33:16,080
It's okay.

8427
05:33:17,680 --> 05:33:18,600
We got a time.

8428
05:33:19,820 --> 05:33:20,520
Oh, nice.

8429
05:33:20,920 --> 05:33:23,320
You have to be careful.

8430
05:33:25,940 --> 05:33:26,560
Here's one.

8431
05:33:26,800 --> 05:33:27,280
Oh.

8432
05:33:29,580 --> 05:33:30,060
Look.

8433
05:33:31,040 --> 05:33:31,520
There's one.

8434
05:33:31,580 --> 05:33:33,380
There's one.

8435
05:33:33,580 --> 05:33:34,360
He's so low.

8436
05:33:34,780 --> 05:33:36,380
What is he doing?

8437
05:33:37,740 --> 05:33:38,500
Okay, Ski...

8438
05:33:38,500 --> 05:33:38,760
It's okay.

8439
05:33:39,100 --> 05:33:39,940
I'm gonna go up.

8440
05:33:40,580 --> 05:33:41,480
Oh, he's gone.

8441
05:33:42,100 --> 05:33:43,940
Don't feel pity for the Mario player...

8442
05:33:43,940 --> 05:33:44,340
He's gone.

8443
05:33:44,440 --> 05:33:44,840
He's gone.

8444
05:33:44,840 --> 05:33:44,920
Oh my god.

8445
05:33:45,860 --> 05:33:46,560
We're good.

8446
05:33:46,620 --> 05:33:47,020
We're okay.

8447
05:33:47,820 --> 05:33:48,240
We're okay.

8448
05:33:50,260 --> 05:33:52,440
Doki, when will we get off this ride?

8449
05:33:52,920 --> 05:33:53,520
Get off?

8450
05:34:00,100 --> 05:34:00,620
Doki!

8451
05:34:00,620 --> 05:34:02,380
Why are we still here, Doki?

8452
05:34:03,680 --> 05:34:05,800
You are here forever, remember?

8453
05:34:06,480 --> 05:34:07,880
You were here forever.

8454
05:34:14,440 --> 05:34:15,080
Alright.

8455
05:34:15,840 --> 05:34:16,480
Interesting.

8456
05:34:16,860 --> 05:34:17,180
Interesting.

8457
05:34:17,560 --> 05:34:17,860
Okay.

8458
05:34:18,840 --> 05:34:20,320
The ride never ends.

8459
05:34:21,200 --> 05:34:22,340
It never ends.

8460
05:34:22,400 --> 05:34:22,640
Don't worry.

8461
05:34:22,740 --> 05:34:23,600
I have 85%.

8462
05:34:23,600 --> 05:34:24,340
We're gonna rush in.

8463
05:34:25,620 --> 05:34:26,980
We live here now.

8464
05:34:27,760 --> 05:34:28,940
Overwatch 2.

8465
05:34:29,080 --> 05:34:30,180
24-7.

8466
05:34:30,500 --> 05:34:32,380
Marvel's Rival waiting room.

8467
05:34:32,600 --> 05:34:35,760
Overwatch every day until Marvel Rivals come out.

8468
05:34:37,980 --> 05:34:40,800
Every day until that game comes out.

8469
05:34:41,100 --> 05:34:42,340
The waiting room.

8470
05:34:45,920 --> 05:34:47,380
Oh no.

8471
05:34:47,960 --> 05:34:49,980
He absorbed you.

8472
05:34:53,800 --> 05:34:54,300
Please!

8473
05:34:54,300 --> 05:34:55,240
He's so low!

8474
05:34:56,580 --> 05:34:59,740
Are you fucking kidding me?

8475
05:34:59,880 --> 05:35:01,860
He lives those?

8476
05:35:04,760 --> 05:35:06,860
He actually lives those.

8477
05:35:09,400 --> 05:35:10,960
Holy shit.

8478
05:35:13,760 --> 05:35:15,180
He actually lives those.

8479
05:35:15,360 --> 05:35:16,980
Guys, I think I know why we're losing.

8480
05:35:17,600 --> 05:35:19,420
We need that deep 30 PS.

8481
05:35:22,980 --> 05:35:24,560
That's literally the reason.

8482
05:35:30,720 --> 05:35:32,020
We broke out.

8483
05:35:32,100 --> 05:35:32,940
We broke out.

8484
05:35:33,100 --> 05:35:34,180
Broke out the cage!

8485
05:35:34,520 --> 05:35:35,600
Break out the cage!

8486
05:35:39,460 --> 05:35:40,020
Beautiful.

8487
05:35:40,160 --> 05:35:40,720
Okay.

8488
05:35:40,820 --> 05:35:41,260
Thank God.

8489
05:35:42,160 --> 05:35:42,720
Okay.

8490
05:35:42,820 --> 05:35:45,760
We have... If we lose this, we literally have...

8491
05:35:46,440 --> 05:35:48,240
85% hit rare.

8492
05:35:48,340 --> 05:35:49,220
15% code.

8493
05:35:49,360 --> 05:35:52,540
100% Marvel waiting room.

8494
05:35:54,560 --> 05:35:56,320
It's just the waiting room!

8495
05:35:57,320 --> 05:35:59,520
That's why we're still playing, guys!

8496
05:36:00,660 --> 05:36:01,620
Soothing your wounds.

8497
05:36:01,940 --> 05:36:04,180
We're still playing because we're just waiting!

8498
05:36:05,800 --> 05:36:08,620
I can stop anytime I want!

8499
05:36:12,880 --> 05:36:13,940
Oh my God.

8500
05:36:13,980 --> 05:36:14,460
What the fuck?

8501
05:36:16,680 --> 05:36:17,560
Oh my God.

8502
05:36:17,600 --> 05:36:19,420
I had to use the cleanse because I got scared.

8503
05:36:20,420 --> 05:36:21,260
Oh no.

8504
05:36:23,980 --> 05:36:24,780
Oh no.

8505
05:36:25,660 --> 05:36:26,540
Oh no.

8506
05:36:27,460 --> 05:36:27,900
No!

8507
05:36:28,860 --> 05:36:29,800
I got my one.

8508
05:36:29,880 --> 05:36:30,680
No, I still win one.

8509
05:36:31,940 --> 05:36:32,960
Is it actually?

8510
05:36:34,720 --> 05:36:36,080
Get on the point!

8511
05:36:36,140 --> 05:36:37,300
Get on the point and heal!

8512
05:36:38,240 --> 05:36:39,320
Get to 90!

8513
05:36:39,600 --> 05:36:41,040
You can do this, Ruben!

8514
05:36:41,220 --> 05:36:41,720
Okay.

8515
05:36:42,460 --> 05:36:42,980
Okay.

8516
05:36:43,200 --> 05:36:43,460
Okay.

8517
05:36:43,860 --> 05:36:44,640
This is it.

8518
05:36:46,380 --> 05:36:48,160
We just gotta make sure they don't die.

8519
05:36:50,100 --> 05:36:50,620
Okay.

8520
05:36:50,700 --> 05:36:51,740
I'm gonna protect our Soldier.

8521
05:36:52,800 --> 05:36:55,800
We gotta protect our Soldier.

8522
05:36:56,680 --> 05:36:58,100
We gotta protect our Soldier.

8523
05:36:58,840 --> 05:36:59,980
I have to...

8524
05:36:59,980 --> 05:37:01,100
One again?

8525
05:37:02,040 --> 05:37:02,680
Here one.

8526
05:37:02,780 --> 05:37:02,940
Here one.

8527
05:37:02,960 --> 05:37:03,120
Here one.

8528
05:37:03,460 --> 05:37:04,920
Please find our Mega.

8529
05:37:05,420 --> 05:37:06,460
Oh my God.

8530
05:37:06,580 --> 05:37:07,380
There's another change from nature.

8531
05:37:07,580 --> 05:37:08,260
Build the Mahou!

8532
05:37:08,260 --> 05:37:08,640
I'll touch.

8533
05:37:08,840 --> 05:37:08,920
I'll touch.

8534
05:37:09,100 --> 05:37:09,140
I'll touch.

8535
05:37:09,220 --> 05:37:09,460
I'll touch.

8536
05:37:09,460 --> 05:37:10,180
Big, big, big.

8537
05:37:10,260 --> 05:37:10,440
You're good.

8538
05:37:11,600 --> 05:37:12,140
It's fine.

8539
05:37:13,100 --> 05:37:13,500
It's fine.

8540
05:37:13,500 --> 05:37:14,200
I got you!

8541
05:37:16,140 --> 05:37:16,540
No!

8542
05:37:17,880 --> 05:37:18,280
No!

8543
05:37:18,900 --> 05:37:19,300
This...

8544
05:37:19,300 --> 05:37:22,820
I protected the Tracer, but I don't know if it was worth it!

8545
05:37:26,140 --> 05:37:27,060
Oh my God.

8546
05:37:27,560 --> 05:37:30,220
Maybe we bribed the other team.

8547
05:37:30,760 --> 05:37:31,560
Poor Boots.

8548
05:37:31,600 --> 05:37:32,940
Thank you for the super chat.

8549
05:37:32,940 --> 05:37:33,580
Thank you.

8550
05:37:33,600 --> 05:37:34,180
Thank you.

8551
05:37:34,220 --> 05:37:35,180
It's not me!

8552
05:37:36,120 --> 05:37:37,420
I don't think this is good.

8553
05:37:37,520 --> 05:37:38,100
I don't think he's gonna touch.

8554
05:37:38,160 --> 05:37:39,060
I told you!

8555
05:37:39,320 --> 05:37:39,760
I...

8556
05:37:40,320 --> 05:37:41,600
Sacrifice was worth it!

8557
05:37:41,720 --> 05:37:41,940
GG!

8558
05:37:42,460 --> 05:37:42,900
GG!

8559
05:37:42,900 --> 05:37:44,520
I honestly walked out of my life not even close.

8560
05:37:45,080 --> 05:37:47,620
GG six before Doki masters.

8561
05:37:47,980 --> 05:37:49,580
Thank you for the super chat, boy.

8562
05:37:49,660 --> 05:37:50,060
Thank you.

8563
05:37:50,060 --> 05:37:50,620
Thank you.

8564
05:37:51,700 --> 05:37:52,980
We broke the win loss.

8565
05:37:53,240 --> 05:37:54,580
Guys, we got a win streak.

8566
05:37:54,580 --> 05:37:54,620
No, my play the game.

8567
05:37:54,680 --> 05:37:55,060
Don't get...

8568
05:37:55,060 --> 05:37:56,220
We got...

8569
05:37:56,220 --> 05:37:58,060
We got the win streak!

8570
05:37:59,160 --> 05:38:00,940
This is the end of the video.

8571
05:38:00,940 --> 05:38:01,120
I'm gonna go back to the chat.

8572
05:38:01,120 --> 05:38:01,440
I'm gonna go back to the chat.

8573
05:38:02,260 --> 05:38:03,940
The save was worth it!

8574
05:38:04,640 --> 05:38:06,060
We didn't need me.

8575
05:38:06,160 --> 05:38:08,040
We needed another DPS.

8576
05:38:10,320 --> 05:38:11,360
We did it.

8577
05:38:11,920 --> 05:38:12,960
Oh my God.

8578
05:38:13,100 --> 05:38:14,660
We fucking did it.

8579
05:38:18,560 --> 05:38:19,760
This is it.

8580
05:38:21,240 --> 05:38:22,180
This is...

8581
05:38:22,180 --> 05:38:23,880
This is fucking it.

8582
05:38:25,380 --> 05:38:27,400
Guys, we broke the win loss streak.

8583
05:38:27,480 --> 05:38:28,440
So like, it's uphill.

8584
05:38:28,600 --> 05:38:28,980
It's...

8585
05:38:28,980 --> 05:38:29,860
It's all...

8586
05:38:29,860 --> 05:38:31,040
It's all like...

8587
05:38:31,040 --> 05:38:31,640
We're all...

8588
05:38:31,640 --> 05:38:32,520
We're still going up.

8589
05:38:34,960 --> 05:38:36,240
I told you guys.

8590
05:38:36,460 --> 05:38:37,460
I told you.

8591
05:38:37,860 --> 05:38:39,160
I told you.

8592
05:38:39,220 --> 05:38:41,260
We get masters here.

8593
05:38:41,680 --> 05:38:42,880
Not washed.

8594
05:38:43,200 --> 05:38:44,380
I'm not washed.

8595
05:38:44,600 --> 05:38:45,520
I'm gaming.

8596
05:38:46,020 --> 05:38:47,300
It's not me.

8597
05:38:47,780 --> 05:38:49,220
It's the enemy team.

8598
05:38:49,500 --> 05:38:50,880
It's my teammates.

8599
05:38:51,340 --> 05:38:51,980
It's...

8600
05:38:56,920 --> 05:38:57,560
It's...

8601
05:38:58,680 --> 05:38:59,760
It was painful.

8602
05:38:59,800 --> 05:38:59,840
It was...

8603
05:38:59,860 --> 05:39:02,420
I'm gaming, they're hacking, they're walling.

8604
05:39:02,440 --> 05:39:03,700
They're aimbotting.

8605
05:39:04,060 --> 05:39:05,760
Um, I'm getting targeted.

8606
05:39:05,920 --> 05:39:07,580
I'm getting harassed.

8607
05:39:07,580 --> 05:39:08,100
I...

8608
05:39:12,620 --> 05:39:15,060
Alright, here we go.

8609
05:39:16,240 --> 05:39:17,080
This is it.

8610
05:39:19,740 --> 05:39:21,400
Alright, what do I play?

8611
05:39:24,220 --> 05:39:24,940
Let's see.

8612
05:39:26,960 --> 05:39:29,000
I'm getting stream sniped.

8613
05:39:30,660 --> 05:39:31,880
Oh, burrito.

8614
05:39:32,060 --> 05:39:32,880
Okay, this is it.

8615
05:39:33,700 --> 05:39:34,880
It's Mercy time.

8616
05:39:35,180 --> 05:39:36,440
It's my turn on Mercy.

8617
05:39:38,560 --> 05:39:41,280
It's my turn on Mercy.

8618
05:39:42,060 --> 05:39:43,860
It's my turn on Mercy.

8619
05:39:54,940 --> 05:39:55,920
My hands are cold.

8620
05:39:56,040 --> 05:39:56,360
Exactly.

8621
05:39:56,880 --> 05:39:57,520
Exactly.

8622
05:39:57,580 --> 05:39:58,660
It's snowing.

8623
05:39:58,660 --> 05:40:00,000
My hands are cold.

8624
05:40:04,440 --> 05:40:06,480
They're not excuses.

8625
05:40:07,060 --> 05:40:07,900
They're reasons.

8626
05:40:08,520 --> 05:40:09,260
Oh no!

8627
05:40:09,920 --> 05:40:10,980
Oh wait, that's a cool skin.

8628
05:40:11,420 --> 05:40:12,240
I like turtles.

8629
05:40:14,040 --> 05:40:15,040
Okay, here we go.

8630
05:40:16,260 --> 05:40:18,780
Yeah, it's everyone's fault but me.

8631
05:40:19,160 --> 05:40:20,300
Because I'm perfect.

8632
05:40:20,840 --> 05:40:23,180
I'm fucking perfect.

8633
05:40:25,780 --> 05:40:28,380
I make the enemy team feel nothing but fear.

8634
05:40:28,840 --> 05:40:30,320
Oh shit.

8635
05:40:30,420 --> 05:40:30,860
Woah!

8636
05:40:32,620 --> 05:40:33,180
Woah!

8637
05:40:35,120 --> 05:40:37,140
I don't feel so good.

8638
05:40:37,980 --> 05:40:39,420
Wait, what the fuck?

8639
05:40:39,520 --> 05:40:40,280
Bro, what are you doing?

8640
05:40:40,600 --> 05:40:41,620
What are you doing?

8641
05:40:44,360 --> 05:40:45,900
Why is she alive?

8642
05:40:47,260 --> 05:40:48,240
Yo, keep me up.

8643
05:40:48,320 --> 05:40:49,020
I live.

8644
05:40:49,960 --> 05:40:50,780
Does she?

8645
05:40:51,000 --> 05:40:52,520
Yo, she did not live.

8646
05:40:52,980 --> 05:40:54,240
Oh my god.

8647
05:40:55,360 --> 05:40:56,000
Yo.

8648
05:40:56,820 --> 05:40:58,560
That was not living.

8649
05:40:58,760 --> 05:41:00,740
I think that was the opposite of living.

8650
05:41:01,080 --> 05:41:01,920
Dude, that monkey was warm.

8651
05:41:02,000 --> 05:41:04,680
That was definitely...

8652
05:41:04,680 --> 05:41:05,460
Oh!

8653
05:41:07,140 --> 05:41:09,400
I got arrowed!

8654
05:41:12,760 --> 05:41:13,400
What?!

8655
05:41:15,460 --> 05:41:19,160
Okay, that was like the most bullshit shot I've ever seen.

8656
05:41:19,560 --> 05:41:20,740
Holy shit.

8657
05:41:22,260 --> 05:41:23,820
Look, I didn't start.

8658
05:41:25,040 --> 05:41:26,860
I was not the first one to die.

8659
05:41:26,960 --> 05:41:27,720
So it was not me.

8660
05:41:28,520 --> 05:41:29,400
That's all I'm saying.

8661
05:41:29,940 --> 05:41:31,660
I might swap Ana later.

8662
05:41:31,920 --> 05:41:33,020
After I get all...

8663
05:41:34,860 --> 05:41:35,720
Yeah, definitely.

8664
05:41:36,100 --> 05:41:37,280
Actually, I can go Zenyatta.

8665
05:41:37,580 --> 05:41:39,620
I feel like Zenyatta would be perfect.

8666
05:41:40,960 --> 05:41:42,380
So we can burn the monkey.

8667
05:41:43,300 --> 05:41:44,880
All of them are under right now.

8668
05:41:45,980 --> 05:41:46,840
Wait, I have ult!

8669
05:41:46,980 --> 05:41:48,420
Is your birth name actually really...

8670
05:41:48,420 --> 05:41:48,740
Woah!

8671
05:41:49,380 --> 05:41:51,200
No, it's just a stage name.

8672
05:41:52,440 --> 05:41:53,700
I was about to say...

8673
05:41:53,700 --> 05:41:54,600
Guys, my...

8674
05:41:55,060 --> 05:41:57,160
My birth name is Jokivari.

8675
05:41:58,180 --> 05:41:59,620
Yeah, what if it was?

8676
05:41:59,620 --> 05:42:00,320
What the fuck?

8677
05:42:00,640 --> 05:42:01,200
Yay!

8678
05:42:03,820 --> 05:42:06,220
Is your birth name Burrito?

8679
05:42:06,820 --> 05:42:07,460
It's fine.

8680
05:42:07,640 --> 05:42:08,520
Uh, kinda, yeah.

8681
05:42:09,500 --> 05:42:10,060
Well...

8682
05:42:10,840 --> 05:42:11,520
Don't worry.

8683
05:42:11,960 --> 05:42:12,640
We're fine.

8684
05:42:13,260 --> 05:42:14,860
We gotta use this to reset.

8685
05:42:15,280 --> 05:42:16,480
He's fine too.

8686
05:42:17,240 --> 05:42:18,340
They're all okay.

8687
05:42:19,320 --> 05:42:20,160
Look at that.

8688
05:42:21,200 --> 05:42:23,480
Yeah, first name Doki, last name Bird.

8689
05:42:24,120 --> 05:42:24,900
Yeah, dude.

8690
05:42:24,940 --> 05:42:26,060
Those sandwiches are wicked.

8691
05:42:26,880 --> 05:42:27,320
See?

8692
05:42:27,680 --> 05:42:28,360
Everything's fine.

8693
05:42:29,120 --> 05:42:30,720
There's no mayo on a Reuben sandwich.

8694
05:42:30,980 --> 05:42:32,660
I knew we'd start the win streak here.

8695
05:42:32,660 --> 05:42:35,180
What the fuck is this?

8696
05:42:35,320 --> 05:42:36,680
What is this conversation?

8697
05:42:37,320 --> 05:42:39,180
What's it have to do with eating Reuben sandwiches?

8698
05:42:40,160 --> 05:42:42,120
Because you would know what type of condiments are on it.

8699
05:42:42,460 --> 05:42:47,420
Well, I know what kind of condiments are on a Reuben sandwich because my name is Reuben Sargassum.

8700
05:42:49,340 --> 05:42:50,460
Oh, I got you, Wyatt.

8701
05:42:50,460 --> 05:42:50,620
Oh, I got you, Wyatt.

8702
05:42:51,200 --> 05:42:53,620
What the fuck is going on?

8703
05:42:53,640 --> 05:42:55,720
Oh shit, I got fucking shit on.

8704
05:42:56,040 --> 05:42:56,900
Let's go back.

8705
05:42:57,040 --> 05:42:59,920
Oh shit, what is going on?

8706
05:43:01,320 --> 05:43:02,920
No ammo on the Abizaria.

8707
05:43:03,060 --> 05:43:03,960
On first point...

8708
05:43:03,960 --> 05:43:05,660
On first point Gibraltar.

8709
05:43:05,840 --> 05:43:06,100
Yeah.

8710
05:43:08,180 --> 05:43:08,840
I'm scared.

8711
05:43:10,680 --> 05:43:11,840
What is he gonna do?

8712
05:43:11,920 --> 05:43:12,500
Walk up?

8713
05:43:13,220 --> 05:43:14,260
He's walking up.

8714
05:43:14,360 --> 05:43:14,880
He's...

8715
05:43:15,720 --> 05:43:16,380
It's okay.

8716
05:43:16,700 --> 05:43:18,440
His inner demons, let him be.

8717
05:43:20,360 --> 05:43:21,280
Alright, we're fine.

8718
05:43:21,380 --> 05:43:22,080
See, I told you.

8719
05:43:22,480 --> 05:43:23,220
We're fine.

8720
05:43:23,920 --> 05:43:25,100
He was on low ground.

8721
05:43:25,560 --> 05:43:27,240
See, I don't even think we need Rush.

8722
05:43:29,160 --> 05:43:29,640
Oh!

8723
05:43:30,800 --> 05:43:34,440
Guys, I think we need a Rush.

8724
05:43:35,580 --> 05:43:36,220
I'm him!

8725
05:43:38,720 --> 05:43:40,640
Average winning team cons.

8726
05:43:41,320 --> 05:43:43,340
Talking about making sandwiches.

8727
05:43:45,500 --> 05:43:45,980
Talking about making sandwiches.

8728
05:43:45,980 --> 05:43:46,460
This is it.

8729
05:43:46,640 --> 05:43:47,420
This is it.

8730
05:43:48,440 --> 05:43:50,040
You know how it's like people...

8731
05:43:51,860 --> 05:43:52,900
who celebrate...

8732
05:43:52,900 --> 05:43:53,740
You know what?

8733
05:43:53,860 --> 05:43:57,380
I bet you, I could easily get top 500 this season.

8734
05:43:57,480 --> 05:43:58,440
I can easily get top 500 this season.

8735
05:43:58,640 --> 05:43:59,500
Everything, man.

8736
05:43:59,900 --> 05:44:00,440
What the hell?

8737
05:44:01,720 --> 05:44:03,020
Just not today.

8738
05:44:03,220 --> 05:44:04,940
Just absolutely not today.

8739
05:44:06,120 --> 05:44:08,060
Guys, we will...

8740
05:44:08,060 --> 05:44:08,200
Guys, we will...

8741
05:44:08,200 --> 05:44:09,500
We're not doing that today.

8742
05:44:12,100 --> 05:44:15,040
I can absolutely get top 500.

8743
05:44:15,160 --> 05:44:17,200
I can touch top 500.

8744
05:44:17,520 --> 05:44:18,420
I will not end this.

8745
05:44:18,440 --> 05:44:20,820
But I absolutely...

8746
05:44:20,820 --> 05:44:22,400
So fucking easy.

8747
05:44:22,900 --> 05:44:23,640
Get there.

8748
05:44:23,900 --> 05:44:24,880
Good job, team.

8749
05:44:26,080 --> 05:44:27,480
I'm not doing it today.

8750
05:44:27,580 --> 05:44:29,200
I have a life right now.

8751
05:44:29,980 --> 05:44:30,920
For like today.

8752
05:44:40,780 --> 05:44:43,140
No, he spent five hours for Barra to not move.

8753
05:44:43,240 --> 05:44:43,740
Yeah, I could be top.

8754
05:44:44,180 --> 05:44:50,840
All I'm saying is that it was a visual bug.

8755
05:44:51,000 --> 05:44:51,520
All I'm saying is that it was a visual bug.

8756
05:44:58,050 --> 05:45:02,410
All I'm saying... the bug... it was a visual bug, guys!

8757
05:45:06,970 --> 05:45:19,050
We would have... we... look, it was... I almost made it to Masters 5, but then... but then, like, Blizzard... there was, like, a bug in the system.

8758
05:45:19,050 --> 05:45:23,190
And then, like, I accidentally lost, like, 50... like, 70 SR.

8759
05:45:23,530 --> 05:45:24,390
It was crazy.

8760
05:45:24,650 --> 05:45:26,370
I was so mad, too.

8761
05:45:26,470 --> 05:45:28,450
Like, it... too bad, like, Rewind is not on.

8762
05:45:28,650 --> 05:45:30,130
So you have to take my word for it.

8763
05:45:34,990 --> 05:45:39,110
It's... it's too bad that, you know, you know, there was no Rewind.

8764
05:45:39,170 --> 05:45:40,630
So you guys couldn't see it.

8765
05:45:40,690 --> 05:45:42,270
But basically, what happened...

8766
05:45:43,470 --> 05:45:44,690
was that... uh...

8767
05:45:44,690 --> 05:45:45,910
I just have a thing against white people.

8768
05:45:46,050 --> 05:45:48,590
...was that I lost 70 SR from, like...

8769
05:45:48,590 --> 05:45:50,270
some weird login stuff.

8770
05:45:50,910 --> 05:45:50,930
...some weird login stuff.

8771
05:45:51,630 --> 05:45:52,510
Bozi Taka!

8772
05:45:53,850 --> 05:45:55,850
Oh my god, he... whoa!

8773
05:45:58,830 --> 05:45:59,350
Amatsukunem!

8774
05:46:00,030 --> 05:46:00,550
Amatsukunem!

8775
05:46:00,830 --> 05:46:01,770
...really close.

8776
05:46:02,750 --> 05:46:04,210
It would be more like...

8777
05:46:04,910 --> 05:46:05,990
...you're supposed to, like...

8778
05:46:06,590 --> 05:46:08,310
...make that sound with your throat.

8779
05:46:08,370 --> 05:46:10,110
The orbs did it!

8780
05:46:10,370 --> 05:46:12,030
Oh yeah, the fucking orbs!

8781
05:46:12,030 --> 05:46:14,950
I only learned the cuss words from our Armenian homies back in the day.

8782
05:46:15,070 --> 05:46:15,710
It's okay, it's okay.

8783
05:46:15,730 --> 05:46:16,230
Say it again.

8784
05:46:16,430 --> 05:46:17,230
Bozi Taka.

8785
05:46:19,130 --> 05:46:19,970
Bozi Taka.

8786
05:46:20,110 --> 05:46:21,390
I think I got it.

8787
05:46:21,470 --> 05:46:22,690
It's better than the first time.

8788
05:46:24,230 --> 05:46:27,210
It's not like this Genji is gonna chase me, right?

8789
05:46:28,510 --> 05:46:29,490
It's not like this Genji is gonna chase me, right?

8790
05:46:29,490 --> 05:46:30,510
Is he swearing in Armenian?

8791
05:46:33,490 --> 05:46:34,310
I'm helping.

8792
05:46:36,310 --> 05:46:36,790
I'm helping.

8793
05:46:40,750 --> 05:46:43,430
Oh god, Kiriko, get your fucking ass out of my screen!

8794
05:46:44,530 --> 05:46:45,170
Kill Bat.

8795
05:46:45,490 --> 05:46:47,030
Kill Bat.

8796
05:46:47,030 --> 05:46:47,970
There you go.

8797
05:46:48,150 --> 05:46:49,950
You must kill Genji here.

8798
05:46:50,310 --> 05:46:51,110
There we go.

8799
05:46:51,330 --> 05:46:52,010
Look at that!

8800
05:46:52,310 --> 05:46:52,850
Windstreak!

8801
05:46:53,830 --> 05:46:55,050
Windstreak right now!

8802
05:46:56,770 --> 05:46:59,970
Yeah, there it goes.

8803
05:46:59,970 --> 05:47:01,290
Thank you for the super chat.

8804
05:47:01,390 --> 05:47:01,630
Thank you.

8805
05:47:03,610 --> 05:47:04,150
Nice.

8806
05:47:04,390 --> 05:47:06,330
I told you, the insurance pays off.

8807
05:47:06,870 --> 05:47:07,710
Look at that.

8808
05:47:07,950 --> 05:47:10,450
The insurance is paying off, everybody!

8809
05:47:11,930 --> 05:47:12,990
I knew it.

8810
05:47:13,410 --> 05:47:14,630
I fucking...

8811
05:47:18,430 --> 05:47:20,270
The insurance, it's working!

8812
05:47:20,910 --> 05:47:21,430
The insurance, it's working!

8813
05:47:23,190 --> 05:47:25,290
Three in a row unheard of.

8814
05:47:25,310 --> 05:47:25,390
Three in a row unheard of.

8815
05:47:25,390 --> 05:47:25,870
This is it.

8816
05:47:25,950 --> 05:47:27,490
This is where you're gonna hear it right now.

8817
05:47:27,610 --> 05:47:32,070
The first Overwatch 2 player that's gonna get a Windstreak.

8818
05:47:32,570 --> 05:47:33,090
The first Overwatch 2 player that's gonna get a Windstreak.

8819
05:47:35,650 --> 05:47:37,630
The very first one!

8820
05:47:38,250 --> 05:47:38,530
The very first one!

8821
05:47:42,570 --> 05:47:43,610
Nobody else...

8822
05:47:44,670 --> 05:47:46,770
will ever get the Windstreak like me.

8823
05:47:50,750 --> 05:47:51,270
Impossible.

8824
05:48:00,070 --> 05:48:00,590
Alright.

8825
05:48:00,590 --> 05:48:01,370
Here we go.

8826
05:48:02,470 --> 05:48:03,210
Here we go.

8827
05:48:04,270 --> 05:48:05,310
Attack Midtown.

8828
05:48:08,690 --> 05:48:10,650
I feel like a Zen player today.

8829
05:48:10,850 --> 05:48:12,190
Yo, yo, yo, how you guys doing?

8830
05:48:19,460 --> 05:48:20,280
This is it.

8831
05:48:21,580 --> 05:48:22,560
This is it.

8832
05:48:23,920 --> 05:48:25,240
Hundreds of dollars.

8833
05:48:25,480 --> 05:48:27,780
The insurance is finally paying off.

8834
05:48:28,100 --> 05:48:29,760
Thank you for the super chat.

8835
05:48:29,860 --> 05:48:31,000
Thank you, thank you.

8836
05:48:31,700 --> 05:48:32,840
This is it.

8837
05:48:33,800 --> 05:48:34,320
Finally.

8838
05:48:36,420 --> 05:48:38,060
It only took me...

8839
05:48:38,060 --> 05:48:39,480
Thank god I'm on streamer mode.

8840
05:48:39,560 --> 05:48:41,300
So nobody can see me griefing aims.

8841
05:48:41,780 --> 05:48:43,200
No one will ever know.

8842
05:48:44,820 --> 05:48:46,420
No one will ever know.

8843
05:48:47,580 --> 05:48:48,260
Who is it?

8844
05:48:49,280 --> 05:48:50,640
Arditiva was the one that...

8845
05:48:50,640 --> 05:48:54,000
fucked over countless people's top 500s.

8846
05:48:57,610 --> 05:48:58,610
This is it.

8847
05:48:58,650 --> 05:48:59,530
The first ever...

8848
05:48:59,530 --> 05:49:00,010
ever...

8849
05:49:00,670 --> 05:49:03,550
out of all players in Overwatch 2 history...

8850
05:49:03,550 --> 05:49:06,010
to have a Windstreak as long as mine.

8851
05:49:06,370 --> 05:49:07,050
Three.

8852
05:49:08,250 --> 05:49:08,930
Yup.

8853
05:49:10,530 --> 05:49:11,750
That's pretty epic.

8854
05:49:11,910 --> 05:49:13,470
The first one.

8855
05:49:19,690 --> 05:49:21,050
Holy shit!

8856
05:49:23,110 --> 05:49:24,250
What was that?

8857
05:49:24,750 --> 05:49:27,910
While I was poking I went from a lot of HP to not a lot of HP.

8858
05:49:28,030 --> 05:49:28,470
That's crazy.

8859
05:49:28,590 --> 05:49:29,590
Yeah, that was scary.

8860
05:49:30,270 --> 05:49:31,670
They won't know I'm here, right?

8861
05:49:31,790 --> 05:49:33,690
Okay, I got 16 damage on the board.

8862
05:49:35,890 --> 05:49:36,850
See, they didn't know.

8863
05:49:38,310 --> 05:49:39,370
Oh, they did it!

8864
05:49:39,430 --> 05:49:39,750
Wow!

8865
05:49:41,270 --> 05:49:41,630
No!

8866
05:49:41,910 --> 05:49:43,970
Soldier is harassing our...

8867
05:49:44,470 --> 05:49:45,450
This is targeted!

8868
05:49:46,030 --> 05:49:46,770
...all of NGL.

8869
05:49:48,250 --> 05:49:48,770
Oh no.

8870
05:49:49,610 --> 05:49:50,630
Wait, they just used turret.

8871
05:49:50,730 --> 05:49:51,030
This is pretty bad.

8872
05:49:52,370 --> 05:49:53,510
We got the Zarya.

8873
05:49:53,710 --> 05:49:54,650
We can still engage and win.

8874
05:49:55,370 --> 05:49:56,710
Yeah, we got the Zarya.

8875
05:49:58,330 --> 05:49:58,810
Alright.

8876
05:49:59,450 --> 05:50:00,690
Nice, we did it.

8877
05:50:01,530 --> 05:50:02,290
Good trade.

8878
05:50:02,710 --> 05:50:03,530
Call on the objective!

8879
05:50:03,870 --> 05:50:04,590
You with me?

8880
05:50:10,090 --> 05:50:10,990
Oh my god.

8881
05:50:11,010 --> 05:50:11,510
Yo, no bugs!

8882
05:50:13,850 --> 05:50:14,810
No soldier.

8883
05:50:15,210 --> 05:50:17,910
I can't see anything, but I think I'm shooting them correctly.

8884
05:50:18,590 --> 05:50:19,410
Oh, I am!

8885
05:50:20,050 --> 05:50:21,770
No, you look fucked up.

8886
05:50:22,070 --> 05:50:24,430
Okay, I might have given them like 200 energy.

8887
05:50:24,650 --> 05:50:24,890
I'll stop them.

8888
05:50:24,910 --> 05:50:25,550
That's okay.

8889
05:50:27,930 --> 05:50:29,950
Oh, I got baited!

8890
05:50:36,490 --> 05:50:38,330
Guys, get rid of the Zarya, please.

8891
05:50:38,510 --> 05:50:40,190
For the love of god, get rid of the Zarya.

8892
05:50:42,850 --> 05:50:44,630
Oh no, Reuben is so dead.

8893
05:50:45,550 --> 05:50:46,490
He's so dead.

8894
05:50:46,650 --> 05:50:47,970
Okay, I gotta stop face-tanking.

8895
05:50:50,550 --> 05:50:52,510
Oh, our Ana is so fucking great.

8896
05:50:53,670 --> 05:50:54,630
That is...

8897
05:50:54,630 --> 05:50:54,750
Okay.

8898
05:50:56,850 --> 05:50:57,970
This is it.

8899
05:50:58,650 --> 05:50:59,530
That is...

8900
05:50:59,530 --> 05:51:00,850
That is genuinely massive.

8901
05:51:00,890 --> 05:51:02,870
As it was closing too.

8902
05:51:03,650 --> 05:51:03,670
Woo!

8903
05:51:04,190 --> 05:51:05,150
Over here!

8904
05:51:06,210 --> 05:51:07,490
Holy fuck.

8905
05:51:07,810 --> 05:51:12,330
Oh no, the fucking truck fucked me over.

8906
05:51:12,590 --> 05:51:13,750
Oh, I'm so mad.

8907
05:51:13,750 --> 05:51:14,790
No, he's so low!

8908
05:51:15,150 --> 05:51:15,690
No!

8909
05:51:15,910 --> 05:51:17,270
Oh fuck!

8910
05:51:18,850 --> 05:51:19,490
Bro!

8911
05:51:21,330 --> 05:51:21,650
Please!

8912
05:51:23,630 --> 05:51:25,690
Please stop targeting me.

8913
05:51:25,690 --> 05:51:27,730
I'm just a poor Zenyatta.

8914
05:51:27,730 --> 05:51:29,130
And they rez their guy.

8915
05:51:29,330 --> 05:51:30,210
I'm just...

8916
05:51:30,210 --> 05:51:32,750
I'm just a poor Zenyatta.

8917
05:51:33,970 --> 05:51:34,530
Stop!

8918
05:51:35,550 --> 05:51:36,910
Huge, big kill.

8919
05:51:37,390 --> 05:51:38,470
Oh, shoot.

8920
05:51:38,530 --> 05:51:39,550
Please, shoot your Ana.

8921
05:51:39,750 --> 05:51:40,590
Shoot your Ana.

8922
05:51:40,990 --> 05:51:41,770
I'm slow.

8923
05:51:42,210 --> 05:51:43,390
I have no legs.

8924
05:51:44,110 --> 05:51:45,690
My legs are just cosmetics.

8925
05:51:48,930 --> 05:51:50,450
Yo, I have a plan.

8926
05:51:50,590 --> 05:51:53,110
My legs are actually just cosmetics, please.

8927
05:51:54,010 --> 05:51:55,130
Please have mercy.

8928
05:51:55,450 --> 05:51:57,330
My plan sucks, but they usually...

8929
05:51:57,730 --> 05:51:59,410
Oh, I've got you, you bastard.

8930
05:51:59,410 --> 05:51:59,970
Oh!

8931
05:52:00,290 --> 05:52:01,190
I'm sorry.

8932
05:52:01,330 --> 05:52:02,930
You were way too far.

8933
05:52:05,710 --> 05:52:06,270
Okay.

8934
05:52:06,650 --> 05:52:07,370
We're fine.

8935
05:52:10,150 --> 05:52:11,030
31, 31.

8936
05:52:11,670 --> 05:52:12,650
Yeah, I got out.

8937
05:52:12,730 --> 05:52:13,670
There you go.

8938
05:52:13,730 --> 05:52:14,470
We got it!

8939
05:52:14,890 --> 05:52:16,410
I have no legs.

8940
05:52:16,490 --> 05:52:17,210
It's cosmetics!

8941
05:52:17,650 --> 05:52:18,370
It's not real!

8942
05:52:21,470 --> 05:52:21,750
Cassidy.

8943
05:52:22,570 --> 05:52:24,110
Wait, where is the Cassidy?

8944
05:52:24,310 --> 05:52:24,710
Oh!

8945
05:52:25,290 --> 05:52:26,170
You couldn't switch spots!

8946
05:52:28,270 --> 05:52:29,370
Oh, he missed the spot!

8947
05:52:29,370 --> 05:52:30,110
He missed the spot!

8948
05:52:31,450 --> 05:52:34,170
Alright, we're fine.

8949
05:52:35,370 --> 05:52:36,050
We're fine.

8950
05:52:38,210 --> 05:52:39,330
Okay, no turret.

8951
05:52:40,530 --> 05:52:41,630
No, you should use my...

8952
05:52:41,630 --> 05:52:43,470
I'm LOIing my healers on purpose because I'm a stupid individual.

8953
05:52:43,470 --> 05:52:43,890
I'm LOIing my healers on purpose because I'm a stupid individual.

8954
05:52:44,870 --> 05:52:45,830
What is he doing?

8955
05:52:46,710 --> 05:52:47,230
What?

8956
05:52:47,230 --> 05:52:47,750
What?

8957
05:52:48,070 --> 05:52:49,330
Did he just sit still?

8958
05:52:52,270 --> 05:52:53,310
I'm scared.

8959
05:52:56,830 --> 05:52:57,250
I'm scared.

8960
05:52:57,250 --> 05:52:58,190
Oh, he was so low though.

8961
05:52:59,050 --> 05:53:00,830
Guys, Desire doesn't know I'm here, right?

8962
05:53:03,290 --> 05:53:03,970
Truly not.

8963
05:53:06,590 --> 05:53:07,170
Oh, god.

8964
05:53:07,630 --> 05:53:08,290
I'm scared.

8965
05:53:11,490 --> 05:53:12,770
Oh, he used the bubble!

8966
05:53:13,210 --> 05:53:13,630
No!

8967
05:53:16,110 --> 05:53:17,570
Oh, my god.

8968
05:53:17,830 --> 05:53:17,950
There's always half.

8969
05:53:18,790 --> 05:53:19,810
Wait, you guys are huge.

8970
05:53:22,830 --> 05:53:23,790
We're doing it!

8971
05:53:25,670 --> 05:53:26,310
We're doing it!

8972
05:53:26,750 --> 05:53:27,810
I told you.

8973
05:53:27,910 --> 05:53:29,630
I told you we can do this.

8974
05:53:31,670 --> 05:53:33,050
I told you.

8975
05:53:33,870 --> 05:53:34,990
Yes, what?

8976
05:53:37,490 --> 05:53:38,010
Alright.

8977
05:53:38,290 --> 05:53:39,590
What kind of question is that?

8978
05:53:39,810 --> 05:53:40,310
We're fine.

8979
05:53:40,470 --> 05:53:41,530
It's like basketball.

8980
05:53:42,010 --> 05:53:43,110
There's like basketball!

8981
05:53:44,710 --> 05:53:45,510
Shoot the Ana!

8982
05:53:45,630 --> 05:53:46,150
Shoot the Ana!

8983
05:53:46,310 --> 05:53:46,870
I'm more important!

8984
05:53:46,870 --> 05:53:48,870
Shoot the Ana!

8985
05:53:50,790 --> 05:53:51,430
I'm more important!

8986
05:53:51,430 --> 05:53:52,350
See, I told you.

8987
05:53:52,750 --> 05:53:54,410
I'm more important!

8988
05:53:54,470 --> 05:53:56,050
I'm more important!

8989
05:53:56,670 --> 05:53:58,350
Our Hog is so dead.

8990
05:53:58,730 --> 05:54:00,490
Our Hog is so dead.

8991
05:54:00,490 --> 05:54:01,950
There's no way.

8992
05:54:02,210 --> 05:54:02,370
There's no way.

8993
05:54:07,030 --> 05:54:10,090
Please, don't let Desire touch me!

8994
05:54:10,630 --> 05:54:11,870
Please, don't let Desire touch me!

8995
05:54:13,210 --> 05:54:14,410
Oh, my god.

8996
05:54:14,410 --> 05:54:15,290
He was so low though.

8997
05:54:15,810 --> 05:54:16,290
AHHHHH!

8998
05:54:16,630 --> 05:54:17,650
THE LAME TOUCHED ME!

8999
05:54:19,410 --> 05:54:20,270
One bubble.

9000
05:54:20,910 --> 05:54:23,190
Jesus Christ, leave me the fuck alone!

9001
05:54:23,850 --> 05:54:24,030
Oh.

9002
05:54:26,290 --> 05:54:28,350
Okay, at least I'll have transfer grab.

9003
05:54:30,450 --> 05:54:31,870
They won't expect me here.

9004
05:54:33,050 --> 05:54:34,170
I'm gonna use full hot.

9005
05:54:34,350 --> 05:54:35,530
Probably swap out real quick.

9006
05:54:37,990 --> 05:54:38,470
HOW?!

9007
05:54:38,470 --> 05:54:40,010
HOW DID HE KNOW?!

9008
05:54:40,710 --> 05:54:41,190
WHAT?!

9009
05:54:45,050 --> 05:54:46,670
Oh, he saw my little foot.

9010
05:54:46,910 --> 05:54:49,250
But why would he go there?!

9011
05:54:49,250 --> 05:54:51,970
Why the fuck would he go there?!

9012
05:54:53,910 --> 05:54:55,310
I told you, I knew it.

9013
05:54:55,330 --> 05:54:56,190
I knew I was getting targeted.

9014
05:54:56,370 --> 05:54:57,370
I knew it.

9015
05:54:57,410 --> 05:54:58,950
There was no other reason.

9016
05:55:00,210 --> 05:55:01,650
I fucking knew it.

9017
05:55:01,770 --> 05:55:04,190
Nobody believed me when I said I got targeted.

9018
05:55:08,010 --> 05:55:10,210
There's literally no other explanation.

9019
05:55:12,910 --> 05:55:13,910
There's no other explanation.

9020
05:55:14,410 --> 05:55:16,550
There's literally no other explanation, guys.

9021
05:55:20,010 --> 05:55:21,310
How else?

9022
05:55:22,090 --> 05:55:24,210
How dare you steal my kills?

9023
05:55:24,990 --> 05:55:25,470
How else?

9024
05:55:27,550 --> 05:55:28,350
Bitch, you're kidding me.

9025
05:55:28,350 --> 05:55:28,890
I got the nano.

9026
05:55:28,970 --> 05:55:29,830
I deserve the kills.

9027
05:55:35,250 --> 05:55:35,930
YEEEEEAAAHHHHH!

9028
05:55:36,370 --> 05:55:37,370
I believe.

9029
05:55:41,230 --> 05:55:42,250
I believe.

9030
05:55:42,250 --> 05:55:42,490
I believe.

9031
05:55:42,710 --> 05:55:46,250
I believe.

9032
05:55:47,710 --> 05:55:48,510
Start believing, guys.

9033
05:55:48,790 --> 05:55:50,250
You gotta keep on believing!

9034
05:55:51,190 --> 05:55:52,350
you gotta keep on believing!

9035
05:55:53,250 --> 05:55:54,290
This is it.

9036
05:55:54,470 --> 05:55:54,570
This is it.

9037
05:55:54,810 --> 05:55:57,030
Okay, I'm gonna throw a little less.

9038
05:55:57,990 --> 05:55:59,830
Maybe with a Gyrocall?

9039
05:56:03,210 --> 05:56:05,230
No, I think my Zen was okay.

9040
05:56:05,910 --> 05:56:06,590
No, I think my Zen was okay.

9041
05:56:06,590 --> 05:56:07,770
My Zen was okay.

9042
05:56:08,170 --> 05:56:08,750
My Zen was okay.

9043
05:56:08,750 --> 05:56:08,870
My Zen was okay.

9044
05:56:09,410 --> 05:56:10,950
Don't stop believing.

9045
05:56:11,490 --> 05:56:11,570
Don't stop believing.

9046
05:56:14,130 --> 05:56:15,630
Okay, maybe I'll go Kiriko.

9047
05:56:15,770 --> 05:56:16,690
Maybe we need the heals.

9048
05:56:16,830 --> 05:56:18,170
I think we need the heals!

9049
05:56:24,520 --> 05:56:26,480
What was my Kiriko win rate?

9050
05:56:26,700 --> 05:56:27,760
Like, at least 50?

9051
05:56:29,700 --> 05:56:33,760
To be fair, you can get a negative win rate and be top 500 now, apparently.

9052
05:56:37,080 --> 05:56:38,740
Please, Doki, I wanna go to sleep.

9053
05:56:38,860 --> 05:56:39,220
Sleep?

9054
05:56:44,820 --> 05:56:46,000
I wanna go to sleep.

9055
05:56:46,320 --> 05:56:46,560
Sleep?

9056
05:56:48,960 --> 05:56:51,400
This is not the Goodnight Dragoon stream.

9057
05:56:51,580 --> 05:56:52,440
What are you talking about?

9058
05:56:55,360 --> 05:56:56,840
What are you talking about?

9059
05:56:58,300 --> 05:56:59,980
Free us, Doki!

9060
05:57:15,880 --> 05:57:16,560
Don't worry.

9061
05:57:17,800 --> 05:57:18,760
I have...

9062
05:57:19,240 --> 05:57:19,720
Oh!

9063
05:57:19,880 --> 05:57:20,960
Good thing I went!

9064
05:57:21,160 --> 05:57:23,140
Okay, it's good that I went.

9065
05:57:26,140 --> 05:57:29,040
It's good that I went Kiriko because they went... they have Ana.

9066
05:57:29,480 --> 05:57:32,200
So I have to go Kiriko for the cleanse.

9067
05:57:36,240 --> 05:57:37,620
That was a hit.

9068
05:57:37,900 --> 05:57:39,080
It was a visual bug.

9069
05:57:40,400 --> 05:57:43,680
It's crazy that we're experiencing all kinds of visual bugs right now.

9070
05:57:44,500 --> 05:57:47,060
It's absolutely... How unlucky are we?

9071
05:57:51,220 --> 05:57:52,200
Like, wow!

9072
05:57:52,420 --> 05:57:57,620
All these visual bugs of things that hit but didn't show up?

9073
05:58:00,320 --> 05:58:01,780
Like, holy shit!

9074
05:58:02,340 --> 05:58:03,700
How is this possible?

9075
05:58:08,400 --> 05:58:11,940
Wait, what the... Bro, what?

9076
05:58:17,600 --> 05:58:18,960
Holy shit!

9077
05:58:21,440 --> 05:58:27,400
We need to call an exterminator with all these bugs you're encountering, Doki!

9078
05:58:29,420 --> 05:58:30,540
I'm so sad.

9079
05:58:33,000 --> 05:58:35,300
We're so... Damn, we're just that unlucky!

9080
05:58:36,040 --> 05:58:37,320
Guys, this...

9081
05:58:42,400 --> 05:58:44,880
I'm honestly just waiting for the fucking end.

9082
05:58:45,060 --> 05:58:46,680
Holy shit!

9083
05:58:49,040 --> 05:58:50,960
You got it!

9084
05:58:51,020 --> 05:58:57,310
You got it!

9085
05:58:57,310 --> 05:58:57,310
Boom!

9086
05:58:58,230 --> 05:58:59,110
Cleansed!

9087
05:58:59,150 --> 05:59:00,790
Did my job.

9088
05:59:02,650 --> 05:59:04,070
I am happy.

9089
05:59:05,090 --> 05:59:06,910
Did my job.

9090
05:59:09,010 --> 05:59:11,490
It's not Doki-M anymore if I'm winning.

9091
05:59:12,490 --> 05:59:13,890
It's reality.

9092
05:59:19,150 --> 05:59:21,210
I wonder if they'll expect me doing this all the way through.

9093
05:59:21,310 --> 05:59:23,110
Let the kitsune guide you!

9094
05:59:26,090 --> 05:59:27,010
Oh yes.

9095
05:59:28,990 --> 05:59:29,670
WOOOOOOAAAHHHHH!

9096
05:59:31,190 --> 05:59:31,870
WOOOOOOAAAHHHHH!

9097
05:59:33,820 --> 05:59:34,400
Oh my god!

9098
05:59:37,220 --> 05:59:37,900
AHHHHHHHHH!

9099
05:59:38,760 --> 05:59:39,440
Climbed!

9100
05:59:39,920 --> 05:59:41,280
Ooh ooh ah ah.

9101
05:59:42,720 --> 05:59:43,400
Easy.

9102
05:59:45,320 --> 05:59:48,160
Reality is often disappointing.

9103
05:59:49,720 --> 05:59:51,080
Reality is often disappointing.

9104
05:59:51,080 --> 05:59:52,000
Thank you for the super chat.

9105
05:59:52,080 --> 05:59:52,820
Thank you thank you.

9106
05:59:52,860 --> 05:59:56,180
Is Overwatch a game we're playing if you're not a streamer gaining income from playing it?

9107
05:59:56,240 --> 05:59:57,140
Thank you for the super chat.

9108
05:59:57,240 --> 05:59:57,800
Thank you thank you.

9109
05:59:58,200 --> 05:59:58,660
Yes.

9110
05:59:59,280 --> 06:00:00,200
But like...

9111
06:00:00,200 --> 06:00:04,160
But don't play too long or you're gonna turn out like me with a...

9112
06:00:04,160 --> 06:00:07,560
with a not addiction and I can quit at any time.

9113
06:00:08,660 --> 06:00:11,540
I can quit any time.

9114
06:00:12,740 --> 06:00:14,600
They have fucking Sigma.

9115
06:00:17,700 --> 06:00:19,380
Bro they have Sigma.

9116
06:00:20,000 --> 06:00:20,920
Oh shit.

9117
06:00:21,080 --> 06:00:23,140
What is going on?

9118
06:00:25,460 --> 06:00:26,120
Prove it.

9119
06:00:26,240 --> 06:00:27,840
I can quit whenever I want.

9120
06:00:29,640 --> 06:00:32,060
I can quit whenever I want.

9121
06:00:32,810 --> 06:00:34,940
I just chose not to quit right now.

9122
06:00:35,420 --> 06:00:36,000
Guys.

9123
06:00:36,500 --> 06:00:38,240
I can pick and choose.

9124
06:00:38,380 --> 06:00:40,540
It's just right now I chose not to.

9125
06:00:43,420 --> 06:00:44,260
I'm escaping.

9126
06:00:44,740 --> 06:00:45,320
Guys?

9127
06:00:45,700 --> 06:00:46,620
Oh no.

9128
06:00:47,640 --> 06:00:49,060
Sorry I'm creating a...

9129
06:00:49,060 --> 06:00:50,400
I come back on Doom.

9130
06:00:53,520 --> 06:00:54,360
I'm running away.

9131
06:00:54,360 --> 06:00:54,840
Okay watch this.

9132
06:00:54,940 --> 06:00:55,200
I...

9133
06:00:55,200 --> 06:00:56,160
shit on you.

9134
06:00:57,820 --> 06:00:58,240
Alright.

9135
06:00:58,800 --> 06:01:00,060
Guys I don't...

9136
06:01:00,060 --> 06:01:01,300
Actually I'll be back in time.

9137
06:01:01,360 --> 06:01:01,820
I don't...

9138
06:01:02,480 --> 06:01:02,900
whaaaaat!

9139
06:01:06,000 --> 06:01:06,980
I knew it.

9140
06:01:07,040 --> 06:01:07,620
Fucking math.

9141
06:01:07,740 --> 06:01:08,800
Math should be banished.

9142
06:01:08,800 --> 06:01:09,900
Fuck math.

9143
06:01:11,680 --> 06:01:13,580
This is why math is terrible.

9144
06:01:13,720 --> 06:01:15,360
We should get rid of math so we can...

9145
06:01:15,360 --> 06:01:17,740
if we get rid of math we won't have physics.

9146
06:01:17,880 --> 06:01:19,460
If we get rid of physics we won't have gravity.

9147
06:01:21,100 --> 06:01:22,840
We just want to make this game a little longer.

9148
06:01:23,200 --> 06:01:24,600
Life does not need gravity.

9149
06:01:25,020 --> 06:01:31,340
I rather we float out from the... I float from on earth and then into the space so then we can go to space.

9150
06:01:33,520 --> 06:01:34,360
Oh my god.

9151
06:01:36,100 --> 06:01:38,060
My fingers felt weird there.

9152
06:01:41,780 --> 06:01:42,220
See?

9153
06:01:42,400 --> 06:01:42,880
Not me.

9154
06:01:43,100 --> 06:01:43,760
Poor guy.

9155
06:01:49,630 --> 06:01:50,070
Fine.

9156
06:01:50,290 --> 06:01:51,370
I saved the Ana.

9157
06:01:51,510 --> 06:01:51,970
We're fine.

9158
06:01:53,330 --> 06:01:54,710
Did my job.

9159
06:01:59,410 --> 06:02:01,090
What the fuck?

9160
06:02:01,490 --> 06:02:02,090
Whoa!

9161
06:02:05,590 --> 06:02:06,930
I'll save you from mass!

9162
06:02:07,530 --> 06:02:08,850
Jesus Christ.

9163
06:02:09,210 --> 06:02:09,630
Jesus Christ.

9164
06:02:10,850 --> 06:02:12,290
Just missed.

9165
06:02:13,670 --> 06:02:14,390
Fine.

9166
06:02:14,630 --> 06:02:15,430
We're fine.

9167
06:02:15,610 --> 06:02:16,430
We're fine.

9168
06:02:16,470 --> 06:02:17,510
We're so fine.

9169
06:02:18,270 --> 06:02:19,570
We're so fine.

9170
06:02:19,630 --> 06:02:20,690
Please get one kill.

9171
06:02:23,490 --> 06:02:23,850
What?

9172
06:02:24,770 --> 06:02:25,330
She's one.

9173
06:02:25,390 --> 06:02:25,870
ONE!

9174
06:02:26,090 --> 06:02:26,750
She's one!

9175
06:02:27,850 --> 06:02:29,050
Oh no.

9176
06:02:29,730 --> 06:02:30,990
She was so low.

9177
06:02:32,390 --> 06:02:33,390
Feedback acknowledged.

9178
06:02:33,630 --> 06:02:36,290
I'll choose Alcalism over Auradon!

9179
06:02:37,390 --> 06:02:38,010
Guys!

9180
06:02:39,810 --> 06:02:40,430
C9!

9181

9220
06:02:43,470 --> 06:02:43,670
No!

9221
06:02:45,490 --> 06:02:46,110
No!

9222
06:02:46,500 --> 06:02:47,250
Thank god!

9223
06:02:50,870 --> 06:02:51,490
Bro!

9224
06:02:52,250 --> 06:02:54,070
Holy shit!

9225
06:02:58,210 --> 06:03:00,370
That provides them with nothing.

9226
06:03:00,650 --> 06:03:03,330
That provides them with nothing.

9227
06:03:09,740 --> 06:03:10,480
I can quit.

9228
06:03:11,160 --> 06:03:12,200
I can quit.

9229
06:03:13,580 --> 06:03:14,680
Where is he?

9230
06:03:14,760 --> 06:03:16,180
No, I lost him!

9231
06:03:17,320 --> 06:03:19,640
Oh my god!

9232
06:03:20,020 --> 06:03:22,460
He fucking floated around!

9233
06:03:22,460 --> 06:03:24,980
Like a fucking butterfly!

9234
06:03:28,660 --> 06:03:31,620
I couldn't see where he was!

9235
06:03:34,820 --> 06:03:35,580
Easy.

9236
06:03:40,880 --> 06:03:42,800
That was so fucking easy.

9237
06:03:45,480 --> 06:03:46,440
Oh no.

9238
06:03:46,740 --> 06:03:47,740
Where is he?

9239
06:03:50,100 --> 06:03:51,360
Okay, we got it.

9240
06:03:53,220 --> 06:03:56,180
I might be slowly losing HP, but we got it.

9241
06:03:56,720 --> 06:03:58,620
And another win!

9242
06:03:59,620 --> 06:04:02,440
Longest win streak an Overwatch 2 player has ever got.

9243
06:04:02,580 --> 06:04:02,900
Four.

9244
06:04:03,640 --> 06:04:04,660
It adds up.

9245
06:04:04,800 --> 06:04:06,360
It keeps adding up.

9246
06:04:07,600 --> 06:04:12,220
It keeps adding up, guys.

9247
06:04:12,520 --> 06:04:13,420
Wait, what?

9248
06:04:13,780 --> 06:04:15,500
Holy shit, that's so sad.

9249
06:04:22,460 --> 06:04:22,980
Oh my god.

9250
06:04:23,680 --> 06:04:24,500
Where did he go?

9251
06:04:24,560 --> 06:04:24,820
There's me.

9252
06:04:24,940 --> 06:04:25,460
Did you see me?

9253
06:04:25,640 --> 06:04:26,620
I was right there.

9254
06:04:27,200 --> 06:04:28,120
Did you see me there?

9255
06:04:28,460 --> 06:04:28,840
Guys.

9256
06:04:29,080 --> 06:04:30,480
Guys, we just... Guys.

9257
06:04:30,860 --> 06:04:31,420
Guys.

9258
06:04:31,800 --> 06:04:34,620
Guys, remember... We started from the bottom.

9259
06:04:39,640 --> 06:04:42,260
Guys, we started from the bottom!

9260
06:04:43,800 --> 06:04:45,620
Remember who you were!

9261
06:04:47,080 --> 06:04:47,640
Remember where you feel like you belong.

9262
06:04:47,700 --> 06:04:49,460
Select your hero.

9263
06:04:50,840 --> 06:04:52,960
Remember where you came from.

9264
06:04:57,460 --> 06:04:58,020
Alright.

9265
06:04:58,480 --> 06:04:59,240
Let's see.

9266
06:04:59,360 --> 06:05:00,040
What do we do?

9267
06:05:02,380 --> 06:05:04,000
This is my origin story.

9268
06:05:05,820 --> 06:05:06,380
Okay.

9269
06:05:06,380 --> 06:05:06,940
Okay.

9270
06:05:07,580 --> 06:05:08,440
This is it.

9271
06:05:09,320 --> 06:05:10,180
You know what?

9272
06:05:10,260 --> 06:05:10,420
No.

9273
06:05:10,540 --> 06:05:13,680
This is where we prove all the haters wrong.

9274
06:05:14,780 --> 06:05:18,580
This is where we pay all... We prove all the haters wrong.

9275
06:05:20,200 --> 06:05:21,200
Fight side!

9276
06:05:21,240 --> 06:05:22,500
Thank you for the Akasufa!

9277
06:05:22,600 --> 06:05:22,940
Thank you!

9278
06:05:22,960 --> 06:05:23,520
Thank you!

9279
06:05:24,780 --> 06:05:27,680
Here's the insurance for hopefully the last game.

9280
06:05:28,020 --> 06:05:29,700
I believe in Doki.

9281
06:05:30,060 --> 06:05:31,860
Thank you for the Akasufa.

9282
06:05:31,860 --> 06:05:32,740
Thank you.

9283
06:05:32,820 --> 06:05:35,780
Doki, don't get overca... No, this is it.

9284
06:05:36,140 --> 06:05:38,340
I prove all the haters wrong.

9285
06:05:38,880 --> 06:05:42,000
I might have a negative win rate on Kiriko.

9286
06:05:42,340 --> 06:05:44,860
But this is where I make it positive.

9287
06:05:45,440 --> 06:05:48,040
Wait, actually... Like how...

9288
06:05:48,040 --> 06:05:49,660
How fucked am I?

9289
06:05:53,080 --> 06:05:57,420
This is where we're gonna make it 35% win rate!

9290
06:05:57,720 --> 06:05:59,040
This is it!

9291
06:06:01,680 --> 06:06:03,200
This is it!

9292
06:06:04,700 --> 06:06:05,920
Oh my god.

9293
06:06:05,980 --> 06:06:06,880
Have confidence.

9294
06:06:08,140 --> 06:06:09,720
Have the confidence.

9295
06:06:10,480 --> 06:06:11,700
They're on Maga.

9296
06:06:11,720 --> 06:06:12,280
Kill me.

9297
06:06:14,960 --> 06:06:16,300
I got free relevant.

9298
06:06:16,460 --> 06:06:16,680
It's fine.

9299
06:06:19,180 --> 06:06:20,060
This is it.

9300
06:06:21,160 --> 06:06:24,120
Okay, I actually might have to go Zenyatta because they have Maga.

9301
06:06:25,120 --> 06:06:27,860
100% confidence right here.

9302
06:06:28,620 --> 06:06:30,260
You gotta have the confidence.

9303
06:06:30,980 --> 06:06:33,140
Oh my god, he was so low.

9304
06:06:34,680 --> 06:06:39,420
Okay, I wanted to die there so I can play this character.

9305
06:06:40,200 --> 06:06:41,060
No TP.

9306
06:06:41,160 --> 06:06:43,440
Guys, there's a reason why I died.

9307
06:06:43,620 --> 06:06:45,040
I wanted to play Zenyatta.

9308
06:06:46,480 --> 06:06:47,000
Guys...

9309
06:06:47,000 --> 06:06:48,020
This is...

9310
06:06:48,020 --> 06:06:50,180
This was the strategic swap here.

9311
06:06:50,660 --> 06:06:53,980
I had to die so I could do this.

9312
06:06:53,980 --> 06:06:54,280
Big kill.

9313
06:06:59,290 --> 06:07:01,150
So I could do this, guys.

9314
06:07:01,510 --> 06:07:02,730
I could use a hand.

9315
06:07:02,990 --> 06:07:04,450
It was all strategic.

9316
06:07:07,270 --> 06:07:09,290
Oh my god, he's so low though.

9317
06:07:09,550 --> 06:07:11,190
He's so low though.

9318
06:07:13,970 --> 06:07:14,850
Someone please!

9319
06:07:15,330 --> 06:07:16,850
Oh, that's really not good.

9320
06:07:16,850 --> 06:07:17,610
Oh, that's not good.

9321
06:07:17,810 --> 06:07:19,490
That is not good for us.

9322
06:07:21,210 --> 06:07:22,710
Oh my god.

9323
06:07:28,070 --> 06:07:29,670
Oh my god!

9324
06:07:29,770 --> 06:07:30,590
There was no...

9325
06:07:30,590 --> 06:07:32,790
I'm nano'd and I immediately die anyway?

9326
06:07:34,090 --> 06:07:34,550
Woo!

9327
06:07:36,150 --> 06:07:36,930
This is it.

9328
06:07:37,010 --> 06:07:37,670
This is fine.

9329
06:07:37,770 --> 06:07:38,690
I got the Maga, guys.

9330
06:07:39,470 --> 06:07:40,090
It's fine.

9331
06:07:40,170 --> 06:07:40,910
I got the Maga.

9332
06:07:42,950 --> 06:07:44,370
Guys, I got the Maga.

9333
06:07:44,370 --> 06:07:44,650
It's fine.

9334
06:07:45,210 --> 06:07:46,230
I got my one.

9335
06:07:47,010 --> 06:07:48,290
Oh my god.

9336
06:07:48,330 --> 06:07:49,050
That was scary though.

9337
06:07:49,390 --> 06:07:50,270
He has Wallace.

9338
06:07:50,730 --> 06:07:52,590
There's no way he knows I'm down here.

9339
06:07:52,890 --> 06:07:54,550
We already have Link, Trance!

9340
06:07:54,790 --> 06:07:55,230
Winneba.

9341
06:07:55,890 --> 06:07:56,850
We don't need him.

9342
06:07:59,910 --> 06:08:00,750
We don't need him.

9343
06:08:00,750 --> 06:08:00,810
We don't need her.

9344
06:08:01,930 --> 06:08:02,850
We need Mido.

9345
06:08:08,650 --> 06:08:11,090
Guys, I'm just gonna slowly walk over to our Hog.

9346
06:08:13,710 --> 06:08:14,150
Guys.

9347
06:08:14,330 --> 06:08:16,890
Guys, I told you.

9348
06:08:16,910 --> 06:08:18,110
We do not need them.

9349
06:08:19,270 --> 06:08:20,150
Oh god.

9350
06:08:20,370 --> 06:08:21,870
We could kill Maga.

9351
06:08:21,890 --> 06:08:22,610
No, thank you.

9352
06:08:22,610 --> 06:08:22,910
No!

9353
06:08:24,010 --> 06:08:26,050
What the fuck is going on?

9354
06:08:26,150 --> 06:08:27,610
What is going on?

9355
06:08:28,590 --> 06:08:29,910
Where is my team?

9356
06:08:31,390 --> 06:08:32,510
Oh my god!

9357
06:08:32,570 --> 06:08:33,790
Where was my team?

9358
06:08:36,970 --> 06:08:39,170
Where did my team go?

9359
06:08:40,850 --> 06:08:41,490
No!

9360
06:08:42,510 --> 06:08:44,290
Where did our team go?

9361
06:08:45,410 --> 06:08:46,430
Okay, guys.

9362
06:08:47,130 --> 06:08:49,430
Guys, it's not because I went...

9363
06:08:49,430 --> 06:08:51,170
Guys, I think...

9364
06:08:51,170 --> 06:08:52,450
I think...

9365
06:08:52,450 --> 06:08:53,590
Guys, I think...

9366
06:08:53,590 --> 06:08:55,190
I think me going...

9367
06:08:55,190 --> 06:08:56,770
Oh my god.

9368
06:08:56,810 --> 06:08:58,710
I think me going Kiriko cursed the game.

9369
06:08:58,930 --> 06:09:00,670
I think it cursed the game, guys.

9370
06:09:01,670 --> 06:09:05,250
I think it cursed the game.

9371
06:09:09,250 --> 06:09:09,810
Okay.

9372
06:09:11,090 --> 06:09:13,930
As long as I...

9373
06:09:16,410 --> 06:09:17,830
Guys, I'm scared.

9374
06:09:18,510 --> 06:09:19,350
I'm stuck.

9375
06:09:20,110 --> 06:09:21,710
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9376
06:09:22,870 --> 06:09:25,110
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9377
06:09:26,070 --> 06:09:27,030
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9378
06:09:32,910 --> 06:09:34,170
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9379
06:09:34,930 --> 06:09:36,910
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9380
06:09:36,990 --> 06:09:38,970
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9381
06:09:39,010 --> 06:09:40,010
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9382
06:09:40,290 --> 06:09:40,570
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9383
06:09:40,570 --> 06:09:40,590
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9384
06:09:40,610 --> 06:09:40,710
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9385
06:09:40,850 --> 06:09:40,910
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9386
06:09:40,910 --> 06:09:41,290
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9387
06:09:41,510 --> 06:09:42,190
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9388
06:09:42,190 --> 06:09:42,270
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9389
06:09:44,550 --> 06:09:45,650
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9390
06:09:46,370 --> 06:09:47,850
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9391
06:09:51,920 --> 06:09:53,360
Guys, I'm actually stuck.

9392
06:09:53,360 --> 06:09:55,640
It's not noticeable, but I definitely don't know how to position a Zenyatta.

9393
06:09:56,640 --> 06:09:57,900
Is it noticeable, guys?

9394
06:09:58,620 --> 06:09:59,580
It's not, right?

9395
06:10:00,480 --> 06:10:01,440
It's not, right?

9396
06:10:06,400 --> 06:10:06,920
Bitch.

9397
06:10:14,640 --> 06:10:15,160
Woo!

9398
06:10:23,590 --> 06:10:24,110
Woo!

9399
06:10:25,970 --> 06:10:27,030
Hey, Mog, I'm coming up to you.

9400
06:10:27,350 --> 06:10:28,010
I'm dead!

9401
06:10:28,110 --> 06:10:28,590
I'm dead!

9402
06:10:28,650 --> 06:10:29,150
I'm dead!

9403
06:10:29,150 --> 06:10:29,590
I'm dead!

9404
06:10:29,650 --> 06:10:30,030
I'm dead!

9405
06:10:30,130 --> 06:10:30,270
No!

9406
06:10:31,510 --> 06:10:33,230
There are so many people there!

9407
06:10:36,470 --> 06:10:38,490
Guys, I don't think that one is.

9408
06:10:38,930 --> 06:10:40,290
Oh my god!

9409
06:10:40,330 --> 06:10:42,310
He lost the fight?!

9410
06:10:45,090 --> 06:10:45,530
What?!

9411
06:10:46,890 --> 06:10:50,790
Guys, it was a nice... it was a pretty cool win streak though, not gonna lie.

9412
06:10:55,970 --> 06:10:58,330
I think the win streak was so cool though.

9413
06:10:58,410 --> 06:10:59,910
I was like...

9414
06:11:00,710 --> 06:11:03,230
Getting that win streak was pretty fucking pog.

9415
06:11:07,130 --> 06:11:07,730
Oh!

9416
06:11:07,850 --> 06:11:08,850
That's where I lose!

9417
06:11:10,530 --> 06:11:13,510
It was... it was a cool win streak.

9418
06:11:13,690 --> 06:11:14,450
It was nice.

9419
06:11:14,810 --> 06:11:15,970
While it lasted.

9420
06:11:16,270 --> 06:11:16,830
You know?

9421
06:11:17,350 --> 06:11:21,670
It was... nobody thought we... nobody thought we had it in it.

9422
06:11:21,810 --> 06:11:22,910
But we did.

9423
06:11:23,690 --> 06:11:25,930
I hate poggers so much.

9424
06:11:27,630 --> 06:11:30,750
It was a pretty sick win streak for a while.

9425
06:11:30,990 --> 06:11:32,050
It really was.

9426
06:11:35,550 --> 06:11:38,390
Why did I pull the Kiriko?

9427
06:11:42,420 --> 06:11:43,460
Here we go.

9428
06:11:45,120 --> 06:11:46,680
It's not over yet.

9429
06:11:50,080 --> 06:11:51,560
We pulled it right here.

9430
06:11:59,870 --> 06:12:00,750
It was the other team's fault.

9431
06:12:00,830 --> 06:12:01,430
It really was.

9432
06:12:02,170 --> 06:12:02,650
Honestly.

9433
06:12:05,570 --> 06:12:06,490
Honestly was.

9434
06:12:12,580 --> 06:12:14,140
I can't believe it.

9435
06:12:14,320 --> 06:12:14,800
Again.

9436
06:12:15,740 --> 06:12:19,340
My team and also the enemy team did this to me.

9437
06:12:19,960 --> 06:12:20,920
As always!

9438
06:12:21,360 --> 06:12:23,460
They always do this to me!

9439
06:12:27,060 --> 06:12:28,040
No, no, no.

9440
06:12:28,080 --> 06:12:28,560
This is it.

9441
06:12:29,380 --> 06:12:31,100
This is where everything changes.

9442
06:12:31,820 --> 06:12:31,960
Chat.

9443
06:12:32,680 --> 06:12:34,320
Everything changes right here.

9444
06:12:35,820 --> 06:12:41,960
I think you need to spend money in the shop so you can boost your Kiriko win rate.

9445
06:12:42,740 --> 06:12:43,660
Shit, you're right.

9446
06:12:43,740 --> 06:12:45,900
I haven't bought anything in this game for like years.

9447
06:12:46,580 --> 06:12:48,140
That makes so much more sense.

9448
06:12:51,610 --> 06:12:52,130
Alright.

9449
06:12:54,450 --> 06:12:56,030
It's like how else would we lose?

9450
06:12:58,630 --> 06:12:59,990
I didn't die though.

9451
06:13:03,270 --> 06:13:06,010
All I'm saying is I did not die.

9452
06:13:06,210 --> 06:13:10,830
To be fair, I think having a Bastion 1 trick is also sort of like causing stuff.

9453
06:13:11,390 --> 06:13:13,750
I'm not gonna lie.

9454
06:13:14,230 --> 06:13:17,130
Having a Bastion 1 trick is not helping.

9455
06:13:22,710 --> 06:13:23,910
Goodbye Bastion.

9456
06:13:26,250 --> 06:13:26,850
Hello.

9457
06:13:28,530 --> 06:13:29,730
Hello Bastion.

9458
06:13:31,170 --> 06:13:32,630
Don't make me use cleanse.

9459
06:13:33,930 --> 06:13:37,690
Oh, I should have used cleanse instead of looking at my Bastion.

9460
06:13:38,010 --> 06:13:40,550
Guys, I think I figured it out.

9461
06:13:42,990 --> 06:13:46,010
We should absolutely not help our Bastion.

9462
06:13:48,450 --> 06:13:51,570
I think... I think I figured it out.

9463
06:13:55,230 --> 06:13:58,490
We should help everybody but the Bastion.

9464
06:13:58,890 --> 06:13:59,650
Oh, yup.

9465
06:13:59,670 --> 06:14:00,510
It's over.

9466
06:14:00,990 --> 06:14:02,550
It was so cool though.

9467
06:14:02,550 --> 06:14:07,570
Having the record for the highest win streak in Overwatch history.

9468
06:14:08,130 --> 06:14:09,830
A swapping 4.

9469
06:14:10,170 --> 06:14:11,550
It's so fucking cool.

9470
06:14:11,690 --> 06:14:13,170
I've never experienced that before.

9471
06:14:15,570 --> 06:14:16,210
Okay.

9472
06:14:16,610 --> 06:14:17,390
Here we go.

9473
06:14:18,190 --> 06:14:18,990
Here we go.

9474
06:14:20,770 --> 06:14:21,410
Woo!

9475
06:14:28,350 --> 06:14:29,210
I'm okay.

9476
06:14:32,550 --> 06:14:33,270
I'm okay.

9477
06:14:33,370 --> 06:14:35,470
They're keeping the role of cleanse or TP so we're gonna kill her.

9478
06:14:36,110 --> 06:14:36,630
Alright.

9479
06:14:36,710 --> 06:14:36,910
See?

9480
06:14:37,090 --> 06:14:37,950
I told you.

9481
06:14:41,710 --> 06:14:42,770
Guys, it's not okay.

9482
06:14:42,890 --> 06:14:43,850
Guys, it's not okay!

9483
06:14:45,690 --> 06:14:46,930
You guys, please.

9484
06:14:47,390 --> 06:14:49,570
Somebody get rid of the fucking...

9485
06:14:49,570 --> 06:14:51,070
Fucking Gonzo.

9486
06:14:52,930 --> 06:14:54,550
I knew it wasn't okay.

9487
06:14:54,890 --> 06:14:57,790
They still have a Widow up there so don't die to her.

9488
06:14:58,550 --> 06:15:00,230
Guess who's gonna die to her.

9489
06:15:00,230 --> 06:15:01,290
In 3...

9490
06:15:02,590 --> 06:15:03,190
2...

9491
06:15:04,690 --> 06:15:05,290
1...

9492
06:15:07,190 --> 06:15:08,210
Oh my god.

9493
06:15:08,270 --> 06:15:09,430
I don't have an ear anymore.

9494
06:15:09,970 --> 06:15:11,590
I don't...

9495
06:15:14,950 --> 06:15:17,030
Oh, I'm so incredibly fucked.

9496
06:15:17,150 --> 06:15:17,790
Just kidding.

9497
06:15:18,250 --> 06:15:18,570
Oh.

9498
06:15:18,770 --> 06:15:18,850
Oh.

9499
06:15:20,470 --> 06:15:21,070
Oh.

9500
06:15:21,510 --> 06:15:24,030
Which one is ours and which one is his?

9501
06:15:24,250 --> 06:15:24,590
Beautiful.

9502
06:15:24,950 --> 06:15:25,690
I'll never know.

9503
06:15:26,510 --> 06:15:27,110
Oh.

9504
06:15:27,190 --> 06:15:27,770
Goodbye.

9505
06:15:28,990 --> 06:15:29,590
Goodbye.

9506
06:15:30,890 --> 06:15:31,490
No.

9507
06:15:31,490 --> 06:15:34,550
Now we have to play this game longer?

9508
06:15:39,670 --> 06:15:40,610
What's going on?

9509
06:15:40,710 --> 06:15:41,370
Good question.

9510
06:15:43,670 --> 06:15:44,110
Maga.

9511
06:15:46,970 --> 06:15:47,790
Leave me alone.

9512
06:15:50,590 --> 06:15:51,410
Where is he?

9513
06:15:52,010 --> 06:15:52,990
Where's the Maga?

9514
06:15:53,070 --> 06:15:53,990
I'm so lost.

9515
06:15:57,870 --> 06:16:00,470
He's like up here but I don't know if I can climb it.

9516
06:16:00,830 --> 06:16:01,750
Don't worry, I got you.

9517
06:16:03,050 --> 06:16:03,510
We will get you there!

9518
06:16:04,690 --> 06:16:05,630
Somebody is asleep.

9519
06:16:05,930 --> 06:16:06,990
Who shot me?

9520
06:16:07,830 --> 06:16:08,750
Ba da da da da.

9521
06:16:12,610 --> 06:16:14,290
Did you hit anything Bastion?

9522
06:16:14,630 --> 06:16:18,070
Judging by you being no one dying I assume no.

9523
06:16:18,670 --> 06:16:20,270
Oh my god.

9524
06:16:20,290 --> 06:16:21,410
That's fucking crazy.

9525
06:16:22,410 --> 06:16:22,970
Ah!

9526
06:16:23,710 --> 06:16:24,530
Someone see me.

9527
06:16:30,190 --> 06:16:31,150
Oh god.

9528
06:16:31,230 --> 06:16:33,430
I just saw the fucking dragon before my eyes.

9529
06:16:34,510 --> 06:16:35,070
I'm so sad.

9530
06:16:35,070 --> 06:16:35,670
We're fine.

9531
06:16:36,890 --> 06:16:38,010
We staggered him.

9532
06:16:40,190 --> 06:16:40,950
Where is she?

9533
06:16:41,310 --> 06:16:41,830
Nooo!

9534
06:16:42,130 --> 06:16:42,850
She TP'd out!

9535
06:16:48,150 --> 06:16:48,670
Alright.

9536
06:16:49,230 --> 06:16:49,990
We're okay.

9537
06:16:50,350 --> 06:16:51,130
We're okay.

9538
06:16:51,570 --> 06:16:52,370
We're okay.

9539
06:16:52,710 --> 06:16:54,090
I do not have Suzu.

9540
06:16:54,190 --> 06:16:54,630
We're okay.

9541
06:16:54,970 --> 06:16:56,010
They have Junkrat.

9542
06:16:56,010 --> 06:16:56,750
Wait, that's good!

9543
06:16:57,010 --> 06:16:57,930
They're giving up!

9544
06:17:00,270 --> 06:17:02,230
That means they're giving up, right?

9545
06:17:02,870 --> 06:17:03,570
What else?

9546
06:17:05,850 --> 06:17:06,530
They're throwing!

9547
06:17:08,490 --> 06:17:09,210
Ohhhhhhh!

9548
06:17:10,070 --> 06:17:12,610
They were not giving up, guys.

9549
06:17:17,690 --> 06:17:19,210
They were not giving up.

9550
06:17:19,610 --> 06:17:22,390
They were absolutely not...

9551
06:17:22,390 --> 06:17:22,710
Nooo!

9552
06:17:23,070 --> 06:17:25,070
I couldn't sneak out!

9553
06:17:26,370 --> 06:17:27,090
Nooo!

9554
06:17:30,070 --> 06:17:32,290
I couldn't sneak out!

9555
06:17:32,490 --> 06:17:33,210
Nooo!

9556
06:17:33,510 --> 06:17:33,990
Alright.

9557
06:17:34,150 --> 06:17:37,310
Just before anything happens, I gotta avoid him.

9558
06:17:38,350 --> 06:17:39,670
Just in advance.

9559
06:17:41,990 --> 06:17:43,890
Oh, now he swaps Reaper?

9560
06:17:44,250 --> 06:17:44,650
Ow.

9561
06:17:47,650 --> 06:17:48,270
It's okay.

9562
06:17:50,650 --> 06:17:51,090
Please!

9563
06:17:57,560 --> 06:17:58,340
Get over here!

9564
06:17:58,600 --> 06:18:00,200
My ult is literally right there!

9565
06:18:01,460 --> 06:18:01,900
Okay.

9566
06:18:02,580 --> 06:18:03,360
Alright, we're fine.

9567
06:18:03,480 --> 06:18:03,800
We're fine.

9568
06:18:04,640 --> 06:18:06,220
We're not fine, but we're still fine.

9569
06:18:10,060 --> 06:18:10,500
Oh.

9570
06:18:11,140 --> 06:18:11,700
It's fine.

9571
06:18:11,800 --> 06:18:12,220
It's fine.

9572
06:18:12,720 --> 06:18:13,320
It's fine.

9573
06:18:13,320 --> 06:18:13,460
But...

9574
06:18:13,460 --> 06:18:14,400
It is not okay!

9575
06:18:18,560 --> 06:18:18,920
Okay.

9576
06:18:19,440 --> 06:18:20,240
I got you!

9577
06:18:20,500 --> 06:18:20,860
Nooo!

9578
06:18:21,720 --> 06:18:22,760
I tanked for you!

9579
06:18:23,660 --> 06:18:24,220
Get that!

9580
06:18:24,300 --> 06:18:24,900
Get that!

9581
06:18:24,900 --> 06:18:25,040
At least!

9582
06:18:26,380 --> 06:18:27,380
Wait, he did do it.

9583
06:18:27,880 --> 06:18:28,860
That's all I have to say.

9584
06:18:29,360 --> 06:18:31,140
I say get a trade at least.

9585
06:18:31,180 --> 06:18:31,980
That's all I have to say.

9586
06:18:32,580 --> 06:18:34,040
Honestly, I'm okay if we lose this.

9587
06:18:34,180 --> 06:18:34,660
So then we don't...

9588
06:18:34,660 --> 06:18:35,840
I'm okay if we don't...

9589
06:18:35,840 --> 06:18:38,560
I don't think it's winnable.

9590
06:18:40,200 --> 06:18:40,920
I'm okay if we don't...

9591
06:18:40,920 --> 06:18:41,200
Oh, no.

9592
06:18:41,300 --> 06:18:42,580
Please, someone get close to me.

9593
06:18:43,300 --> 06:18:44,760
Someone get close so I can TP.

9594
06:18:48,440 --> 06:18:50,720
They definitely have tire.

9595
06:18:52,200 --> 06:18:56,160
I can feel the tire coming out soon.

9596
06:18:58,920 --> 06:19:02,660
I can feel the tire right now.

9597
06:19:04,580 --> 06:19:05,760
There it is.

9598
06:19:06,180 --> 06:19:07,160
There it is.

9599
06:19:07,340 --> 06:19:08,140
Oh, it's okay.

9600
06:19:10,220 --> 06:19:12,000
One more minute of this.

9601
06:19:12,060 --> 06:19:12,560
Here we go.

9602
06:19:14,180 --> 06:19:17,340
We're just prolonging the invisible right here.

9603
06:19:17,500 --> 06:19:18,980
We're just prolonging this.

9604
06:19:21,160 --> 06:19:23,060
Wait, is Junkrat still alive?

9605
06:19:24,040 --> 06:19:24,660
How?

9606
06:19:27,560 --> 06:19:29,840
Is there someone above us or behind us?

9607
06:19:29,840 --> 06:19:30,140
Yeah.

9608
06:19:31,320 --> 06:19:31,940
No!

9609
06:19:34,640 --> 06:19:36,420
Somebody get him out of there!

9610
06:19:37,360 --> 06:19:38,180
Nice, okay.

9611
06:19:39,060 --> 06:19:40,280
Somebody got him out.

9612
06:19:44,150 --> 06:19:44,710
Alright.

9613
06:19:46,990 --> 06:19:48,250
This is it.

9614
06:19:52,220 --> 06:19:53,220
Oh, heat.

9615
06:19:55,180 --> 06:19:56,360
There's a mug on me?

9616
06:19:56,600 --> 06:19:57,440
Thank you.

9617
06:19:58,700 --> 06:20:03,360
I sort of was not surprised with the outcome of that ult.

9618
06:20:05,400 --> 06:20:10,200
For some reason, I was definitely not surprised with what happened there.

9619
06:20:10,360 --> 06:20:13,860
I will wait for Rush before I... I'll wait for us to have Rush before we do.

9620
06:20:13,880 --> 06:20:14,280
This is where I am.

9621
06:20:15,060 --> 06:20:15,620
Woo!

9622
06:20:15,800 --> 06:20:16,220
My ult.

9623
06:20:18,040 --> 06:20:19,100
Alright, here you go.

9624
06:20:19,600 --> 06:20:20,360
This is it.

9625
06:20:24,240 --> 06:20:25,100
I'm gonna do it.

9626
06:20:27,720 --> 06:20:29,860
Oh, holy shit!

9627
06:20:33,210 --> 06:20:34,310
Alright, bye.

9628
06:20:36,450 --> 06:20:39,230
Okay, we both used Cage and Rush.

9629
06:20:40,470 --> 06:20:41,290
You're fine!

9630
06:20:44,750 --> 06:20:45,770
He's so low!

9631
06:20:45,770 --> 06:20:45,770
No!

9632
06:20:45,930 --> 06:20:46,530
Please!

9633
06:20:47,610 --> 06:20:48,650
He's alive!

9634
06:20:49,230 --> 06:20:50,390
Oh my god, I'm...

9635
06:20:50,390 --> 06:20:51,670
Oh, okay.

9636
06:20:56,580 --> 06:20:57,530
I thought I fell.

9637
06:20:57,690 --> 06:20:59,390
I legitimately thought I fell.

9638
06:21:06,430 --> 06:21:09,110
Okay, they're not bottom left anymore.

9639
06:21:13,720 --> 06:21:14,500
Okay.

9640
06:21:15,000 --> 06:21:16,040
It's fine!

9641
06:21:16,790 --> 06:21:17,180
Suzu!

9642
06:21:20,460 --> 06:21:21,440
It's okay!

9643
06:21:21,660 --> 06:21:22,840
It's not okay anymore!

9644
06:21:23,560 --> 06:21:25,020
It's not okay!

9645
06:21:25,700 --> 06:21:26,500
Oh!

9646
06:21:30,690 --> 06:21:31,490
What?!

9647
06:21:32,330 --> 06:21:33,130
Okay.

9648
06:21:33,730 --> 06:21:35,910
This is okay.

9649
06:21:36,650 --> 06:21:37,790
This is...

9650
06:21:38,450 --> 06:21:39,290
This is okay.

9651
06:21:39,870 --> 06:21:40,670
This...

9652
06:21:40,670 --> 06:21:41,490
This...

9653
06:21:43,910 --> 06:21:45,190
This is okay.

9654
06:21:52,070 --> 06:21:53,170
This is okay.

9655
06:21:53,290 --> 06:21:54,710
We can keep going.

9656
06:22:05,630 --> 06:22:06,270
It's...

9657
06:22:06,790 --> 06:22:07,550
It'll be fine.

9658
06:22:07,990 --> 06:22:08,630
It'll...

9659
06:22:08,630 --> 06:22:09,670
It'll be fine.

9660
06:22:14,530 --> 06:22:15,870
I'll find my own path.

9661
06:22:15,970 --> 06:22:17,470
This is okay.

9662
06:22:18,970 --> 06:22:21,010
Dead weight gets left behind.

9663
06:22:21,010 --> 06:22:22,450
Whoa, is that an emote?

9664
06:22:22,510 --> 06:22:23,370
What the fuck?

9665
06:22:23,370 --> 06:22:25,790
It has to be an emote.

9666
06:22:25,850 --> 06:22:26,110
What?

9667
06:22:26,930 --> 06:22:29,070
This is a long fucking emote.

9668
06:22:29,250 --> 06:22:31,230
Does it stop when like he's done walking?

9669
06:22:32,790 --> 06:22:33,490
Oh my god.

9670
06:22:33,550 --> 06:22:34,310
Wait, that's pretty sick.

9671
06:22:34,490 --> 06:22:35,530
I didn't know that was an emote.

9672
06:22:38,390 --> 06:22:40,730
Oh yeah, it keeps going until...

9673
06:22:46,210 --> 06:22:47,890
Now push him to the door.

9674
06:22:50,530 --> 06:22:50,930
Hey.

9675
06:22:53,030 --> 06:22:53,510
Okay.

9676
06:22:54,670 --> 06:22:55,570
Okay, come on.

9677
06:22:56,010 --> 06:22:58,190
It'll be cool if you walk out the door like this.

9678
06:22:58,270 --> 06:22:58,350
No!

9679
06:22:58,610 --> 06:22:59,910
It would've been so cool!

9680
06:23:02,350 --> 06:23:05,810
Okay, not gonna lie, it would've been so funny if he got like headshot.

9681
06:23:06,230 --> 06:23:07,550
Oh my god!

9682
06:23:07,810 --> 06:23:08,210
What?

9683
06:23:09,650 --> 06:23:11,290
What happened to his HP?

9684
06:23:13,590 --> 06:23:16,130
Like actually, what happened to his HP?

9685
06:23:17,050 --> 06:23:19,710
What the fuck happened to his HP?

9686
06:23:20,090 --> 06:23:20,430
Okay.

9687
06:23:20,430 --> 06:23:22,030
Oh, it's because they have a widow!

9688
06:23:27,070 --> 06:23:27,730
That's why.

9689
06:23:29,490 --> 06:23:31,970
Guys, now I'm not so sure anymore.

9690
06:23:32,390 --> 06:23:32,910
Okay.

9691
06:23:33,350 --> 06:23:33,870
Okay.

9692
06:23:34,110 --> 06:23:35,050
This is okay.

9693
06:23:39,030 --> 06:23:39,550
What?

9694
06:23:40,450 --> 06:23:41,670
Are you serious?

9695
06:23:41,850 --> 06:23:43,690
Oh, this is not okay anymore.

9696
06:23:44,510 --> 06:23:45,030
Guys.

9697
06:23:45,730 --> 06:23:47,270
There might be...

9698
06:23:47,270 --> 06:23:49,150
I personally think they should remove Maga from the game.

9699
06:23:49,150 --> 06:23:52,350
This might not be as okay as I expected it to be.

9700
06:23:52,510 --> 06:23:53,870
This... is awful.

9701
06:23:55,890 --> 06:23:56,870
They used M.O.

9702
06:24:00,290 --> 06:24:02,950
It's not as okay, because they have a widow.

9703
06:24:05,010 --> 06:24:06,390
Their widow's on fire.

9704
06:24:06,650 --> 06:24:07,490
Oh no.

9705
06:24:08,170 --> 06:24:10,570
Oh no, it's not okay anymore.

9706
06:24:10,810 --> 06:24:11,950
Where's our Ana?!

9707
06:24:12,770 --> 06:24:15,390
Oh no, I have to do this to...

9708
06:24:16,590 --> 06:24:17,150
No!

9709
06:24:17,310 --> 06:24:17,770
No!

9710
06:24:17,770 --> 06:24:18,030
Nooo!

9711
06:24:18,250 --> 06:24:19,590
Where did our Ana go?

9712
06:24:21,790 --> 06:24:23,510
Our Ana was flanking!

9713
06:24:26,110 --> 06:24:30,590
Our Ana was flanking so I had to heal it all by myself!

9714
06:24:36,730 --> 06:24:39,390
Ana, I needed heals help!

9715
06:24:40,050 --> 06:24:42,390
I needed you to help me!

9716
06:24:47,770 --> 06:24:48,130
Ana!

9717
06:24:54,250 --> 06:24:54,770
Nooo!

9718
06:24:56,430 --> 06:24:59,230
Guys, we could have had this match end like 30 minutes ago.

9719
06:24:59,430 --> 06:25:00,090
Not gonna lie.

9720
06:25:00,890 --> 06:25:06,510
This match could have been over so long ago and I would have killed you in another game!

9721
06:25:08,330 --> 06:25:11,110
I could have been in another game by now!

9722
06:25:15,550 --> 06:25:17,570
I can't believe your name is egghouse.

9723
06:25:17,670 --> 06:25:18,290
It's egghouse.

9724
06:25:18,850 --> 06:25:19,930
It's uh...

9725
06:25:20,450 --> 06:25:22,030
It's one shot one kill.

9726
06:25:22,630 --> 06:25:23,150
It's...

9727
06:25:23,710 --> 06:25:24,850
It's... What was the other one?

9728
06:25:24,930 --> 06:25:26,350
I already forgot the other one names.

9729
06:25:26,530 --> 06:25:28,110
Other stream sniper mode names.

9730
06:25:30,190 --> 06:25:30,730
Yay!

9731
06:25:32,990 --> 06:25:33,530
Yay!

9732
06:25:37,410 --> 06:25:39,210
It was Slayer.

9733
06:25:39,530 --> 06:25:40,630
Already Tracer.

9734
06:25:40,790 --> 06:25:41,530
It was Kitsune.

9735
06:25:41,930 --> 06:25:43,010
It was...

9736
06:25:46,180 --> 06:25:46,990
12 hooks!

9737
06:25:51,010 --> 06:25:52,290
3 minutes of this.

9738
06:25:53,150 --> 06:25:54,930
3 minutes of a perfect game.

9739
06:25:55,110 --> 06:25:59,570
And with my teammates, it is not going to be a perfect game and you all know it.

9740
06:26:01,850 --> 06:26:03,250
I don't even want to peek.

9741
06:26:07,010 --> 06:26:07,570
Oh.

9742
06:26:09,010 --> 06:26:10,610
Oh, it's approaching guys.

9743
06:26:14,310 --> 06:26:15,950
Oh, we're trying.

9744
06:26:15,970 --> 06:26:17,350
We're trying so hard.

9745
06:26:20,810 --> 06:26:21,370
Oh.

9746
06:26:21,370 --> 06:26:21,670
Oh.

9747
06:26:22,270 --> 06:26:24,970
Oh no, I don't have Suzu right now.

9748
06:26:27,030 --> 06:26:28,670
Oh, this is scary.

9749
06:26:34,990 --> 06:26:35,510
Okay.

9750
06:26:35,510 --> 06:26:36,870
You have self-heal now.

9751
06:26:37,190 --> 06:26:38,930
Now get your self-heal in charge.

9752
06:26:39,070 --> 06:26:39,730
They're just waiting.

9753
06:26:39,910 --> 06:26:40,230
No!

9754
06:26:40,950 --> 06:26:41,630
Oh, it's okay.

9755
06:26:44,290 --> 06:26:45,350
Bastion, what are you doing?

9756
06:26:45,850 --> 06:26:46,370
Guys.

9757
06:26:47,210 --> 06:26:51,890
I think our Bastion was may or may not have been a hero.

9758
06:26:51,890 --> 06:26:52,970
That was so just so low.

9759
06:26:54,330 --> 06:26:55,890
Like, just maybe.

9760
06:26:56,410 --> 06:26:57,510
Just say maybe.

9761
06:27:00,710 --> 06:27:03,630
Just a reversal.

9762
06:27:03,650 --> 06:27:04,530
There's no way.

9763
06:27:04,570 --> 06:27:07,070
I got a Bastion one trick and they gave me a reversal.

9764
06:27:07,250 --> 06:27:13,210
I got a Bastion one trick and they're giving me a reversal?

9765
06:27:18,590 --> 06:27:20,690
How is this fair?

9766
06:27:25,870 --> 06:27:27,070
It's okay guys.

9767
06:27:27,410 --> 06:27:31,510
I achieved something that has never been achieved in Overwatch history.

9768
06:27:32,330 --> 06:27:33,810
In Overwatch 2 history.

9769
06:27:34,190 --> 06:27:36,750
A four game win streak, guys.

9770
06:27:36,950 --> 06:27:38,650
This has never been done before.

9771
06:27:38,990 --> 06:27:41,590
I got a four game win streak, everybody.

9772
06:27:41,970 --> 06:27:42,430
I...

9773
06:27:44,010 --> 06:27:46,170
It truly was...

9774
06:27:47,350 --> 06:27:49,610
It truly was unstoppable.

9775
06:27:50,190 --> 06:27:51,430
The first one.

9776
06:27:51,430 --> 06:27:57,130
The very first Overwatch 2 player to achieve such a feat.

9777
06:27:57,590 --> 06:27:59,630
We were so close.

9778
06:27:59,970 --> 06:28:04,050
The four game win streak right here.

9779
06:28:06,030 --> 06:28:08,550
Live for all of us to see.

9780
06:28:10,070 --> 06:28:11,290
Is that crazy?

9781
06:28:12,810 --> 06:28:14,430
Select your hero.

9782
06:28:14,710 --> 06:28:16,050
Select your hero.

9783
06:28:17,030 --> 06:28:17,750
Alright.

9784
06:28:17,950 --> 06:28:18,430
It's okay.

9785
06:28:18,450 --> 06:28:19,890
I avoided the Bastion one trick.

9786
06:28:19,890 --> 06:28:21,850
We will never have to deal with that shit again.

9787
06:28:22,510 --> 06:28:23,390
I hope.

9788
06:28:23,750 --> 06:28:24,510
I hope.

9789
06:28:26,990 --> 06:28:28,030
Never again.

9790
06:28:28,830 --> 06:28:30,890
Will I have to deal with this.

9791
06:28:31,330 --> 06:28:32,490
Yo, yo, yo.

9792
06:28:32,650 --> 06:28:33,810
How you guys doing?

9793
06:28:35,050 --> 06:28:35,830
What's up man?

9794
06:28:36,550 --> 06:28:38,150
I'm doing amazingly.

9795
06:28:38,390 --> 06:28:39,210
On a win streak.

9796
06:28:39,350 --> 06:28:40,150
Feeling fantastic.

9797
06:28:41,070 --> 06:28:42,150
You ready to lose?

9798
06:28:42,470 --> 06:28:43,190
Wait, what?

9799
06:28:43,310 --> 06:28:44,110
Absolutely not.

9800
06:28:44,190 --> 06:28:44,950
Not on my watch.

9801
06:28:45,230 --> 06:28:45,630
What?

9802
06:28:46,490 --> 06:28:47,010
Go.

9803
06:28:49,890 --> 06:28:50,330
I'm not doing anything that I do.

9804
06:28:50,550 --> 06:28:51,430
I refuse.

9805
06:28:52,290 --> 06:28:53,990
You have to go down to go up.

9806
06:28:54,030 --> 06:28:54,470
Exactly.

9807
06:28:54,790 --> 06:28:56,270
Thank you for the super chat.

9808
06:28:56,410 --> 06:28:56,710
Thank you.

9809
06:28:56,790 --> 06:28:57,270
Exactly.

9810
06:28:59,610 --> 06:29:00,390
How's it going?

9811
06:29:01,210 --> 06:29:02,130
I'm in charge.

9812
06:29:03,470 --> 06:29:04,670
This is it.

9813
06:29:05,290 --> 06:29:06,470
Two games in a row.

9814
06:29:07,950 --> 06:29:09,590
There's no way we could fail.

9815
06:29:10,470 --> 06:29:11,790
Two games in a row.

9816
06:29:11,910 --> 06:29:12,730
We can do this.

9817
06:29:13,190 --> 06:29:14,870
Seems more likely than you think.

9818
06:29:15,090 --> 06:29:15,410
Chat.

9819
06:29:16,530 --> 06:29:19,270
Seems more fucking likely than you think.

9820
06:29:19,270 --> 06:29:19,410
Two.

9821
06:29:20,490 --> 06:29:20,950
One.

9822
06:29:22,310 --> 06:29:23,330
Attackers incoming.

9823
06:29:24,330 --> 06:29:25,930
Defend objective A.

9824
06:29:26,550 --> 06:29:28,030
Don't keep each other safe.

9825
06:29:28,790 --> 06:29:29,570
Don't fret.

9826
06:29:29,830 --> 06:29:30,650
I see you.

9827
06:29:31,590 --> 06:29:33,370
Junker queen soldier Hanzo.

9828
06:29:34,630 --> 06:29:35,230
No!

9829
06:29:35,370 --> 06:29:36,370
No, I have to... What?

9830
06:29:36,810 --> 06:29:38,550
How did that hit nobody?

9831
06:29:39,950 --> 06:29:40,550
Okay.

9832
06:29:40,630 --> 06:29:43,150
Some of these... I blame ping.

9833
06:29:43,490 --> 06:29:44,410
I'm going high ground.

9834
06:29:44,410 --> 06:29:45,410
There's no way.

9835
06:29:45,570 --> 06:29:47,450
Enemy seen.

9836
06:29:47,670 --> 06:29:48,450
Oh, they're all high ground.

9837
06:29:51,130 --> 06:29:51,910
Oh, god.

9838
06:29:53,170 --> 06:29:54,290
Oh, god.

9839
06:29:58,740 --> 06:29:59,620
Oh, god.

9840
06:29:59,740 --> 06:30:00,300
Oh, god.

9841
06:30:00,300 --> 06:30:00,400
We're fine.

9842
06:30:05,110 --> 06:30:07,010
Hey, there is a Kiriko over there.

9843
06:30:12,650 --> 06:30:12,930
MP!

9844
06:30:15,210 --> 06:30:15,770
Yay!

9845
06:30:20,170 --> 06:30:20,730
Yay!

9846
06:30:21,550 --> 06:30:22,910
Oh, not yay.

9847
06:30:24,870 --> 06:30:26,230
Not yay, guys.

9848
06:30:26,470 --> 06:30:26,990
Not yay.

9849
06:30:27,310 --> 06:30:29,830
It has not been... It's not yay anymore.

9850
06:30:32,530 --> 06:30:35,130
I have never felt so un-yayed in my life.

9851
06:30:35,230 --> 06:30:35,930
I keep you up.

9852
06:30:39,130 --> 06:30:39,610
Wee.

9853
06:30:40,070 --> 06:30:41,310
Okay, I should not go.

9854
06:30:42,050 --> 06:30:42,530
Marga!

9855
06:30:43,150 --> 06:30:44,290
They're on Marga!

9856
06:30:44,530 --> 06:30:47,610
Please, can I experience joy?

9857
06:30:47,950 --> 06:30:50,550
Am I allowed to experience joy and happiness?

9858
06:30:51,050 --> 06:30:51,710
It's okay.

9859
06:30:52,510 --> 06:30:53,190
It's okay.

9860
06:30:56,150 --> 06:30:57,270
We're killing these guys.

9861
06:30:57,270 --> 06:30:58,110
They don't know I'm here.

9862
06:30:58,410 --> 06:30:59,690
They don't know.

9863
06:30:59,930 --> 06:31:01,230
That's the...

9864
06:31:06,830 --> 06:31:07,870
Guys.

9865
06:31:08,630 --> 06:31:09,670
Guys.

9866
06:31:09,770 --> 06:31:09,790
Guys.

9867
06:31:10,170 --> 06:31:12,470
I did so much.

9868
06:31:12,570 --> 06:31:13,550
I did.

9869
06:31:13,710 --> 06:31:14,610
I actually...

9870
06:31:14,930 --> 06:31:18,550
I actually solo killed the soldier.

9871
06:31:19,210 --> 06:31:19,890
I actually solo killed the soldier.

9872
06:31:19,890 --> 06:31:19,950
I actually solo killed the soldier.

9873
06:31:19,950 --> 06:31:20,830
Please.

9874
06:31:22,390 --> 06:31:24,110
The soldier.

9875
06:31:25,030 --> 06:31:28,550
I can't believe it.

9876
06:31:28,590 --> 06:31:28,650
I can't believe it.

9877
06:31:32,610 --> 06:31:35,010
I can't fucking believe it.

9878
06:31:35,090 --> 06:31:35,470
I can't fucking believe it.

9879
06:31:35,470 --> 06:31:35,710
I see you.

9880
06:31:40,050 --> 06:31:41,150
Here it comes.

9881
06:31:42,530 --> 06:31:44,470
Okay, I should be able to head high ground, right?

9882
06:31:44,510 --> 06:31:44,570
Okay, I should be able to head high ground, right?

9883
06:31:44,570 --> 06:31:47,650
There's no way somebody will just be like peek-a-boo and then run at me.

9884
06:31:48,010 --> 06:31:49,090
Yep, I knew it.

9885
06:31:49,630 --> 06:31:50,810
I knew I'll be fine.

9886
06:31:55,030 --> 06:31:55,850
Are you...

9887
06:31:55,850 --> 06:31:56,130
Oh.

9888
06:31:57,090 --> 06:31:59,750
He was not able to climb back up, guys.

9889
06:31:59,750 --> 06:32:02,090
It was...

9890
06:32:02,090 --> 06:32:04,110
That team...

9891
06:32:04,110 --> 06:32:05,210
They're so fucking...

9892
06:32:05,750 --> 06:32:07,370
Where?

9893
06:32:08,230 --> 06:32:10,970
Oh my god.

9894
06:32:11,170 --> 06:32:11,410
Oh my god.

9895
06:32:11,410 --> 06:32:12,570
Because you wanted me to...

9896
06:32:15,110 --> 06:32:16,230
Please.

9897
06:32:17,330 --> 06:32:17,890
No!

9898
06:32:19,570 --> 06:32:20,690
Guys.

9899
06:32:22,950 --> 06:32:24,070
Guys.

9900
06:32:24,370 --> 06:32:26,630
I don't know what to do.

9901
06:32:27,050 --> 06:32:29,590
I don't know what to do.

9902
06:32:29,590 --> 06:32:30,310
I'm not finished.

9903
06:32:30,910 --> 06:32:33,990
Why is everyone so spread out?

9904
06:32:35,610 --> 06:32:36,170
Why?

9905
06:32:36,810 --> 06:32:37,010
Why?

9906
06:32:40,650 --> 06:32:41,210
Alright.

9907
06:32:41,690 --> 06:32:42,770
They used...

9908
06:32:43,770 --> 06:32:44,330
Alright.

9909
06:32:44,510 --> 06:32:46,370
So, I'm gonna live here now.

9910
06:32:47,190 --> 06:32:48,250
I live here.

9911
06:32:48,410 --> 06:32:49,350
This is my home.

9912
06:32:52,090 --> 06:32:53,570
Oh no, I have to reload.

9913
06:32:54,210 --> 06:32:55,610
It's okay, I hit those!

9914
06:32:56,110 --> 06:32:56,630
I'm just going.

9915
06:32:57,510 --> 06:32:58,790
I live here now.

9916
06:32:59,150 --> 06:33:00,610
I'm just going to back up a bit.

9917
06:33:01,630 --> 06:33:01,950
It's okay.

9918
06:33:02,750 --> 06:33:03,450
We're fine.

9919
06:33:03,630 --> 06:33:04,390
Wait, they capped?

9920
06:33:04,870 --> 06:33:06,750
Wait, when did they cap?

9921
06:33:07,510 --> 06:33:08,990
I didn't even notice.

9922
06:33:14,410 --> 06:33:16,370
I actually did not even notice we capped.

9923
06:33:19,430 --> 06:33:20,070
I'm dead.

9924
06:33:23,580 --> 06:33:24,800
JK, I'm alive.

9925
06:33:25,020 --> 06:33:25,860
We're still back.

9926
06:33:29,140 --> 06:33:30,020
We're still back.

9927
06:33:30,660 --> 06:33:31,760
I'm alive, bitch.

9928
06:33:35,830 --> 06:33:36,850
Okay, here we go.

9929
06:33:38,250 --> 06:33:39,350
I'm so scared.

9930
06:33:42,910 --> 06:33:43,990
I'm so scared.

9931
06:33:44,390 --> 06:33:45,570
I'm so scared.

9932
06:33:47,250 --> 06:33:50,760
I'm so scared.

9933
06:33:50,940 --> 06:33:51,860
I'm so...

9934
06:33:51,860 --> 06:33:52,540
Alright.

9935
06:33:52,920 --> 06:33:53,600
Fuck it.

9936
06:33:56,680 --> 06:33:57,400
Fuck it.

9937
06:33:57,960 --> 06:33:59,120
It was worth it.

9938
06:33:59,500 --> 06:34:00,300
It was...

9939
06:34:00,300 --> 06:34:01,500
It was worth it.

9940
06:34:01,560 --> 06:34:04,260
I know I could have waited for the nano... for the blade.

9941
06:34:04,740 --> 06:34:06,060
But I can't be bothered.

9942
06:34:09,920 --> 06:34:11,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

9943
06:34:11,800 --> 06:34:11,980
Ash.

9944
06:34:12,940 --> 06:34:13,940
Please, please, please.

9945
06:34:17,320 --> 06:34:17,680
Alright.

9946
06:34:19,160 --> 06:34:21,600
Okay, they're going to have maga ult and then we're fucked.

9947
06:34:21,860 --> 06:34:24,840
As long as I'm not next to him, we should be fine, right?

9948
06:34:26,800 --> 06:34:28,280
As long as we're not next to...

9949
06:34:28,900 --> 06:34:30,140
They also have...

9950
06:34:30,140 --> 06:34:33,000
Not only do they have maga ult, they also have blade.

9951
06:34:33,460 --> 06:34:35,140
But it'll be okay, right?

9952
06:34:35,660 --> 06:34:39,740
Not only do they have blade, but they also have soldier ult.

9953
06:34:39,880 --> 06:34:41,060
But we'll be fine, right?

9954
06:34:41,460 --> 06:34:42,700
I hope so.

9955
06:34:46,260 --> 06:34:46,820
We'll...

9956
06:34:46,820 --> 06:34:48,500
We'll be so fine.

9957
06:34:49,800 --> 06:34:50,360
We'll be so fine.

9958
06:34:50,360 --> 06:34:51,000
Stand up straight.

9959
06:34:51,520 --> 06:34:53,200
Oh, this is it.

9960
06:34:53,280 --> 06:34:55,160
I couldn't... Oh, this is it.

9961
06:34:55,440 --> 06:34:56,580
This... Oh, goodbye.

9962
06:34:57,040 --> 06:35:00,400
Okay, they use rush and maga and blade.

9963
06:35:01,720 --> 06:35:02,800
I could...

9964
06:35:03,840 --> 06:35:06,080
I could see my life flash by.

9965
06:35:06,380 --> 06:35:07,020
I could see my life flash by.

9966
06:35:07,020 --> 06:35:07,020
There.

9967
06:35:07,260 --> 06:35:08,500
I saw it.

9968
06:35:09,720 --> 06:35:12,960
I saw my life flash before me, right there.

9969
06:35:13,140 --> 06:35:14,840
Exactly at that moment.

9970
06:35:15,320 --> 06:35:16,960
We also have nano.

9971
06:35:17,760 --> 06:35:18,920
Yeah, we have nano.

9972
06:35:26,760 --> 06:35:28,040
Oh no.

9973
06:35:31,660 --> 06:35:32,300
No!

9974
06:35:34,760 --> 06:35:35,140
No!

9975
06:35:40,080 --> 06:35:40,640
No!

9976
06:35:40,760 --> 06:35:41,160
No!

9977
06:35:41,160 --> 06:35:42,500
It's because they went maga!

9978
06:35:43,540 --> 06:35:44,580
I'm so close.

9979
06:35:44,680 --> 06:35:45,520
It was so close.

9980
06:35:46,500 --> 06:35:47,640
We were so close.

9981
06:35:49,340 --> 06:35:50,820
They still had blade.

9982
06:35:51,080 --> 06:35:51,960
No, we had blade.

9983
06:35:52,420 --> 06:35:55,020
This team is the anti-fun police.

9984
06:35:58,600 --> 06:36:00,220
Oh my god, fuck you, play.

9985
06:36:00,600 --> 06:36:01,160
Zediana.

9986
06:36:01,440 --> 06:36:03,440
I hate maga so much.

9987
06:36:05,240 --> 06:36:07,040
We were this close.

9988
06:36:09,300 --> 06:36:11,280
We were this close.

9989
06:36:11,300 --> 06:36:12,200
We were this close, everybody.

9990
06:36:12,960 --> 06:36:13,160
We were this close, everybody.

9991
06:36:22,030 --> 06:36:23,730
Oh my god.

9992
06:36:24,130 --> 06:36:24,330
Oh my god.

9993
06:36:25,550 --> 06:36:27,630
I can't believe it.

9994
06:36:28,090 --> 06:36:28,790
I can't believe it.

9995
06:36:32,370 --> 06:36:34,170
We were right there.

9996
06:36:34,370 --> 06:36:35,950
We were right there!

9997
06:36:35,950 --> 06:36:36,210
We were right there!

9998
06:36:40,850 --> 06:36:42,010
This is the comeback.

9999
06:36:42,250 --> 06:36:43,670
Surely, this is the comeback, right?

10000
06:36:44,290 --> 06:36:45,650
Surely, this is it.

10001
06:36:47,650 --> 06:36:49,590
We will get everything back here.

10002
06:36:57,170 --> 06:36:58,510
Right here, right now.

10003
06:36:59,850 --> 06:37:02,010
My sanity is perfectly healthy.

10004
06:37:04,430 --> 06:37:05,450
My sanity.

10005
06:37:09,730 --> 06:37:12,930
I can change heroes.

10006
06:37:13,890 --> 06:37:15,270
I can't.

10007
06:37:15,830 --> 06:37:17,050
This is it.

10008
06:37:17,670 --> 06:37:19,630
Is it Maga?

10009
06:37:19,670 --> 06:37:20,290
Is it...

10010
06:37:20,290 --> 06:37:23,170
I almost got headshot there.

10011
06:37:24,990 --> 06:37:26,050
Where is he?

10012
06:37:33,760 --> 06:37:36,160
He's actually so low though.

10013
06:37:36,160 --> 06:37:38,040
I think it's actually not fair.

10014
06:37:38,880 --> 06:37:40,160
How low he was.

10015
06:37:41,980 --> 06:37:43,100
Oh my god.

10016
06:37:44,480 --> 06:37:47,280
I'm trying my best to keep them up right now.

10017
06:37:50,600 --> 06:37:51,700
Oh god.

10018
06:37:52,100 --> 06:37:54,620
I'm just gonna stay here for now.

10019
06:37:56,480 --> 06:37:58,740
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah.

10020
06:37:59,580 --> 06:38:01,620
Chill chill chill chill chill.

10021
06:38:02,200 --> 06:38:03,260
Chill chill chill.

10022
06:38:04,820 --> 06:38:05,380
Alright.

10023
06:38:06,160 --> 06:38:07,540
Okay, I discord Maga.

10024
06:38:07,600 --> 06:38:08,060
It's over.

10025
06:38:11,100 --> 06:38:12,140
It's fucking over.

10026
06:38:12,880 --> 06:38:14,000
I discord him.

10027
06:38:14,120 --> 06:38:16,120
It's so... Okay, he got rid of my discord.

10028
06:38:16,340 --> 06:38:17,720
But I'll discord him again.

10029
06:38:17,880 --> 06:38:18,980
And then it'll be over.

10030
06:38:23,080 --> 06:38:25,940
I discord him here and then it'll be over.

10031
06:38:27,580 --> 06:38:28,880
Oh my god.

10032
06:38:28,940 --> 06:38:29,400
He's dead.

10033
06:38:34,260 --> 06:38:34,740
Woah!

10034
06:38:35,460 --> 06:38:35,940
Okay.

10035
06:38:37,780 --> 06:38:38,580
I'm trying.

10036
06:38:41,910 --> 06:38:42,390
Alright.

10037
06:38:42,570 --> 06:38:43,790
He can get rid of my discord.

10038
06:38:45,710 --> 06:38:46,470
That's five.

10039
06:38:47,270 --> 06:38:47,430
That's five.

10040
06:38:47,430 --> 06:38:49,030
Let the Kitsune guide you!

10041
06:38:50,110 --> 06:38:51,070
Let the Kitsune guide you!

10042
06:38:51,070 --> 06:38:51,550
Let the Kitsune guide you!

10043
06:38:52,730 --> 06:38:53,210
Nice.

10044
06:38:53,410 --> 06:38:54,270
He got him where he wanted.

10045
06:38:54,550 --> 06:38:56,390
Thank god.

10046
06:38:56,910 --> 06:38:58,130
Where else would he want?

10047
06:39:00,250 --> 06:39:00,950
There you go.

10048
06:39:01,770 --> 06:39:03,450
That soldier still has ult.

10049
06:39:03,810 --> 06:39:04,270
That soldier still has ult.

10050
06:39:05,210 --> 06:39:06,210
He's going up.

10051
06:39:06,290 --> 06:39:06,990
What is he gonna do?

10052
06:39:07,130 --> 06:39:07,730
Drop down?

10053
06:39:07,970 --> 06:39:08,550
He dropped down.

10054
06:39:09,090 --> 06:39:09,390
Where's he going?

10055
06:39:09,670 --> 06:39:10,890
Where's he running at?

10056
06:39:11,510 --> 06:39:12,470
Where's he going?

10057
06:39:15,470 --> 06:39:18,630
How the trip never stops on and on and is beyond insane.

10058
06:39:18,830 --> 06:39:19,530
This is it!

10059
06:39:21,590 --> 06:39:22,330
Is that...

10060
06:39:22,330 --> 06:39:23,750
Okay, he's still playing Maga.

10061
06:39:28,330 --> 06:39:29,570
There's no way.

10062
06:39:30,350 --> 06:39:31,250
There you go.

10063
06:39:31,950 --> 06:39:33,010
There you go.

10064
06:39:33,270 --> 06:39:35,790
But I'm gonna... I'm gonna die soon.

10065
06:39:37,750 --> 06:39:38,870
Holy shit.

10066
06:39:40,270 --> 06:39:41,390
Holy shit.

10067
06:39:41,390 --> 06:39:44,470
I just know I live for a very long time.

10068
06:39:44,650 --> 06:39:46,450
Neither of our HPs are moving.

10069
06:39:47,830 --> 06:39:50,710
Oh, I know for sure your HP is going down.

10070
06:39:52,390 --> 06:39:54,390
I've got you in my sights.

10071
06:39:54,490 --> 06:39:55,810
Oh, our Genghis is dead, right?

10072
06:39:56,150 --> 06:39:56,630
Yep.

10073
06:39:57,690 --> 06:39:59,290
He was behind me this entire time.

10074
06:39:59,810 --> 06:40:01,690
The soldier's Omega infant.

10075
06:40:01,850 --> 06:40:02,190
Never mind.

10076
06:40:02,310 --> 06:40:03,070
Oh, he's fine.

10077
06:40:05,290 --> 06:40:05,910
Wait, what?

10078
06:40:07,790 --> 06:40:08,590
He has discord!

10079
06:40:08,710 --> 06:40:09,770
He's so losable!

10080
06:40:10,490 --> 06:40:11,370
Oh, he got him.

10081
06:40:12,170 --> 06:40:13,750
He got big health pack.

10082
06:40:14,390 --> 06:40:15,310
They're about to attack.

10083
06:40:17,710 --> 06:40:18,830
I can farm this.

10084
06:40:19,430 --> 06:40:20,510
I can farm this.

10085
06:40:23,270 --> 06:40:25,190
Alright, let's hope they do the thing.

10086
06:40:27,470 --> 06:40:27,950
Guys?

10087
06:40:31,590 --> 06:40:32,930
Oh my god.

10088
06:40:38,830 --> 06:40:40,030
Guys, I'm okay.

10089
06:40:40,250 --> 06:40:40,890
Good job.

10090
06:40:41,770 --> 06:40:42,950
I'm so okay.

10091
06:40:44,890 --> 06:40:45,450
Oh!

10092
06:40:47,910 --> 06:40:49,210
I told you.

10093
06:40:49,730 --> 06:40:51,970
I told you guys I'd be okay.

10094
06:40:52,970 --> 06:40:54,390
Look at those dinks.

10095
06:40:58,660 --> 06:40:59,660
I knew it.

10096
06:41:00,140 --> 06:41:01,340
Go Kiriko, go!

10097
06:41:01,580 --> 06:41:02,120
Go!

10098
06:41:02,240 --> 06:41:02,880
You go!

10099
06:41:03,160 --> 06:41:03,920
You go heal!

10100
06:41:04,620 --> 06:41:05,700
Go Kiriko!

10101
06:41:06,000 --> 06:41:07,940
You better heal, I'll put that me!

10102
06:41:09,420 --> 06:41:10,880
I have no legs!

10103
06:41:10,980 --> 06:41:13,180
I have to fucking sit here!

10104
06:41:14,400 --> 06:41:15,740
Oh my god, that's embarrassing.

10105
06:41:15,980 --> 06:41:16,700
Oh, I'm so sorry.

10106
06:41:26,780 --> 06:41:27,340
I'm so sorry.

10107
06:41:35,100 --> 06:41:36,220
Go Kiriko.

10108
06:41:36,380 --> 06:41:37,080
I have to go.

10109
06:41:37,380 --> 06:41:41,200
Go Kiriko.

10110
06:41:41,280 --> 06:41:41,580
I'm so sorry.

10111
06:41:41,580 --> 06:41:41,620
I'm so sorry.

10112
06:41:41,640 --> 06:41:43,120
I should have fought you before!

10113
06:41:43,880 --> 06:41:44,920
I have to fight!

10114
06:41:44,920 --> 06:41:44,980
Kiriko, you are being a bitch!

10115
06:41:44,980 --> 06:41:46,200
Get the fuck out of here!

10116
06:41:46,200 --> 06:41:49,640
I'm gonna- Okay.

10117
06:41:49,640 --> 06:41:50,540
Okay, that's fine.

10118
06:41:50,840 --> 06:41:51,520
That's fine.

10119
06:41:51,540 --> 06:41:52,200
We do this again.

10120
06:41:52,860 --> 06:41:54,180
Oh, we do this again.

10121
06:41:56,540 --> 06:41:57,120
It's okay.

10122
06:41:58,240 --> 06:41:59,320
We do this again.

10123
06:42:01,100 --> 06:42:02,940
Yeah, they wasted Blade as well!

10124
06:42:04,220 --> 06:42:04,700
Alright.

10125
06:42:06,680 --> 06:42:09,720
Okay, everything is not the best.

10126
06:42:10,140 --> 06:42:11,200
But we can...

10127
06:42:11,200 --> 06:42:13,920
We can just, you know, cope for a little bit.

10128
06:42:15,640 --> 06:42:17,540
Oh, I love hearing that thing.

10129
06:42:17,640 --> 06:42:24,520
Oh my god, everybody is low!

10130
06:42:24,980 --> 06:42:27,340
I don't know who to look at!

10131
06:42:30,220 --> 06:42:32,840
Everybody is low and I'm scared!

10132
06:42:37,660 --> 06:42:41,480
It's okay, I got Rush before... I mean not Rush, Cage before he died.

10133
06:42:42,140 --> 06:42:43,900
Yeah, I got Blade too.

10134
06:42:43,920 --> 06:42:44,480
Pulse.

10135
06:42:45,060 --> 06:42:46,240
Yeah, I have...

10136
06:42:46,920 --> 06:42:47,520
Ulti soon.

10137
06:42:49,920 --> 06:42:51,700
Look, all I'm saying is...

10138
06:42:53,470 --> 06:42:55,300
If we have time, I'll swap to Ana.

10139
06:42:57,580 --> 06:42:58,120
Okay.

10140
06:42:58,540 --> 06:42:59,340
There we go.

10141
06:43:00,040 --> 06:43:02,760
I need to get my fucking ult in time.

10142
06:43:05,900 --> 06:43:06,440
Oh!

10143
06:43:06,440 --> 06:43:06,980
Nice!

10144
06:43:09,260 --> 06:43:09,800
Go!

10145
06:43:10,480 --> 06:43:11,020
No!

10146
06:43:11,260 --> 06:43:12,040
Get her!

10147
06:43:12,040 --> 06:43:13,100
No!

10148
06:43:13,100 --> 06:43:14,300
That is so embarrassing!

10149
06:43:16,460 --> 06:43:17,020
No!

10150
06:43:28,760 --> 06:43:29,320
No!

10151
06:43:31,270 --> 06:43:33,310
I just got Trans!

10152
06:43:33,790 --> 06:43:34,350
No!

10153
06:43:37,330 --> 06:43:38,590
I can't believe it.

10154
06:43:38,610 --> 06:43:39,650
I literally just got Trans.

10155
06:43:41,270 --> 06:43:43,170
I was like the deal breaker here.

10156
06:43:45,490 --> 06:43:47,270
I literally just got it too.

10157
06:43:51,810 --> 06:43:52,630
Oh no.

10158
06:43:53,090 --> 06:43:54,290
They have Mogul.

10159
06:43:56,450 --> 06:43:57,790
They have Mogul!

10160
06:44:03,650 --> 06:44:05,390
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah!

10161
06:44:09,330 --> 06:44:10,410
Oh, hell no!

10162
06:44:10,570 --> 06:44:12,110
Oh, get out, get out, get out!

10163
06:44:12,210 --> 06:44:13,010
Leave, leave, leave!

10164
06:44:13,190 --> 06:44:13,290
No!

10165
06:44:13,450 --> 06:44:14,570
We lost our Hanzo!

10166
06:44:16,250 --> 06:44:17,870
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice!

10167
06:44:17,970 --> 06:44:18,710
That's a good kill!

10168
06:44:21,110 --> 06:44:21,890
They have...

10169
06:44:21,890 --> 06:44:22,230
They have...

10170
06:44:22,230 --> 06:44:23,270
...Rosh and Gage.

10171
06:44:23,430 --> 06:44:25,390
We have to get in the... I have Trans!

10172
06:44:25,950 --> 06:44:27,450
Just make sure I live!

10173
06:44:27,890 --> 06:44:29,170
Oh, they have Blade too.

10174
06:44:29,370 --> 06:44:30,190
Which is...

10175
06:44:31,770 --> 06:44:33,110
Oh, god, no.

10176
06:44:33,230 --> 06:44:34,210
They have Blade, guys.

10177
06:44:34,830 --> 06:44:35,350
Guys.

10178
06:44:35,890 --> 06:44:37,070
They have Blade.

10179
06:44:37,650 --> 06:44:38,750
So, like...

10180
06:44:39,290 --> 06:44:40,230
There we go.

10181
06:44:41,410 --> 06:44:41,930
Oh!

10182
06:44:42,450 --> 06:44:43,450
Don't touch my team!

10183
06:44:45,790 --> 06:44:47,890
How is he alive?!

10184
06:44:50,390 --> 06:44:51,430
Oh, my god.

10185
06:44:51,450 --> 06:44:51,650
Oh, my god.

10186
06:44:51,650 --> 06:44:52,050
This is bad.

10187
06:44:52,150 --> 06:44:53,410
This is so bad.

10188
06:44:57,510 --> 06:44:59,450
Oh, my god!

10189
06:44:59,490 --> 06:45:00,750
I kicked him off!

10190
06:45:00,810 --> 06:45:03,010
I kicked him off!

10191
06:45:08,810 --> 06:45:10,670
Oh, my god!

10192
06:45:11,130 --> 06:45:12,810
That Turkey Kick!

10193
06:45:14,130 --> 06:45:15,750
That's the only way!

10194
06:45:16,010 --> 06:45:17,950
That was the only way!

10195
06:45:21,010 --> 06:45:24,090
I got aesthetic legs for the win!

10196
06:45:27,090 --> 06:45:29,250
The thing is...

10197
06:45:29,990 --> 06:45:32,430
I don't know if I should play...

10198
06:45:32,430 --> 06:45:36,710
I don't know if I should fucking play Ana or Zen.

10199
06:45:37,490 --> 06:45:40,010
Because they've both been working so well!

10200
06:45:42,650 --> 06:45:43,950
I can't believe it.

10201
06:45:44,490 --> 06:45:46,290
I kicked him off.

10202
06:45:49,310 --> 06:45:50,350
Holy shit.

10203
06:45:52,890 --> 06:45:55,270
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

10204
06:45:55,570 --> 06:45:56,290
This is it.

10205
06:45:59,590 --> 06:46:00,650
This should be it.

10206
06:46:01,650 --> 06:46:03,210
My mother trained half our team.

10207
06:46:03,570 --> 06:46:05,330
I'll sign the rest of you up for lessons.

10208
06:46:08,030 --> 06:46:09,110
Can I stick with Zen?

10209
06:46:09,310 --> 06:46:09,770
Play Zen?

10210
06:46:10,110 --> 06:46:10,470
Okay.

10211
06:46:12,070 --> 06:46:13,710
But we could build Nano!

10212
06:46:15,310 --> 06:46:16,270
But we could build...

10213
06:46:16,290 --> 06:46:16,910
We could build Nano though.

10214
06:46:18,850 --> 06:46:21,390
I feel like I should play Ana for the Nano.

10215
06:46:22,550 --> 06:46:24,090
I'm going to go for the Nano.

10216
06:46:24,530 --> 06:46:25,730
The Nano for the...

10217
06:46:25,730 --> 06:46:30,610
The Nano for the... you know...

10218
06:46:31,370 --> 06:46:32,490
The Genji Blade.

10219
06:46:36,210 --> 06:46:37,930
It might be worth it.

10220
06:46:38,370 --> 06:46:39,790
Just think of the plan.

10221
06:46:44,220 --> 06:46:45,800
This is why I want Ana.

10222
06:46:48,900 --> 06:46:50,020
They have no QZ.

10223
06:46:55,120 --> 06:46:56,000
Oh no.

10224
06:46:56,360 --> 06:46:56,800
No!

10225
06:46:57,060 --> 06:46:58,240
The Torbjorn!

10226
06:46:58,700 --> 06:46:58,820
No!

10227
06:47:01,220 --> 06:47:02,480
If it was Zen...

10228
06:47:02,480 --> 06:47:03,920
If it was Zen, it would not have mattered.

10229
06:47:04,020 --> 06:47:04,880
I'm going to say...

10230
06:47:04,880 --> 06:47:06,460
Genji, do you think you can get Sombra for this?

10231
06:47:06,500 --> 06:47:08,560
It would not have mattered if I was Zenyatta.

10232
06:47:13,160 --> 06:47:14,040
A Junkrat?

10233
06:47:14,180 --> 06:47:14,700
You don't have to touch.

10234
06:47:14,820 --> 06:47:16,580
You may move now or not to touch.

10235
06:47:17,020 --> 06:47:17,460
Attack!

10236
06:47:19,220 --> 06:47:21,000
Zen could have kicked away.

10237
06:47:21,660 --> 06:47:22,860
It would not have mattered.

10238
06:47:22,860 --> 06:47:23,760
All I'm saying...

10239
06:47:30,990 --> 06:47:31,690
More than.

10240
06:47:31,750 --> 06:47:31,990
More than.

10241
06:47:35,290 --> 06:47:36,590
I have to reload.

10242
06:47:36,850 --> 06:47:37,310
I have to reload.

10243
06:47:40,290 --> 06:47:40,810
Okay.

10244
06:47:45,510 --> 06:47:46,030
Alright.

10245
06:47:47,550 --> 06:47:48,570
Alright, here we go.

10246
06:47:48,730 --> 06:47:50,290
Zen would have kicked.

10247
06:47:52,610 --> 06:47:57,430
Guys, it would not have mattered if I was...

10248
06:47:59,110 --> 06:47:59,710
Zen

10249
06:48:04,630 --> 06:48:04,830
would have kicked.

10250
06:48:04,830 --> 06:48:06,330
I almost have ult too.

10251
06:48:10,760 --> 06:48:12,580
I'm just going to reload just in case.

10252
06:48:21,980 --> 06:48:23,360
I'm a little scared.

10253
06:48:23,380 --> 06:48:24,000
Not going to lie.

10254
06:48:34,790 --> 06:48:36,970
What is going on?

10255
06:48:40,630 --> 06:48:42,190
I told you!

10256
06:48:42,550 --> 06:48:42,790
Beautiful.

10257
06:48:43,050 --> 06:48:44,130
Trust the nano!

10258
06:48:45,390 --> 06:48:47,030
Trust the nano!

10259
06:48:48,290 --> 06:48:49,310
What the f...

10260
06:48:49,310 --> 06:48:49,810
Same.

10261
06:48:50,210 --> 06:48:51,930
What the f is happening?

10262
06:48:52,170 --> 06:48:53,050
What the f?

10263
06:48:53,330 --> 06:48:53,790
You...

10264
06:48:54,950 --> 06:48:55,510
Maga?

10265
06:48:55,850 --> 06:48:56,730
They have Zen.

10266
06:48:56,830 --> 06:48:57,070
Okay.

10267
06:48:57,830 --> 06:49:01,390
Ladies and gentlemen, I need some support ults.

10268
06:49:01,550 --> 06:49:02,110
Maga.

10269
06:49:02,190 --> 06:49:03,770
I wish I could heal the tire.

10270
06:49:21,640 --> 06:49:22,760
Oh, god.

10271
06:49:22,800 --> 06:49:23,180
Oh, god.

10272
06:49:23,180 --> 06:49:23,620
Oh, god.

10273
06:49:24,020 --> 06:49:24,900
Oh, God.

10274
06:49:29,640 --> 06:49:30,380
Oh, God.

10275
06:49:30,380 --> 06:49:31,020
Oh my god!

10276
06:49:31,260 --> 06:49:33,980
War is returned there!

10277
06:49:37,800 --> 06:49:38,840
Oh my god!

10278
06:49:39,020 --> 06:49:40,620
There were so many things!

10279
06:49:41,020 --> 06:49:43,380
There were so many things!

10280
06:49:45,200 --> 06:49:48,020
Why were there so many things?

10281
06:49:52,120 --> 06:49:52,540
Okay.

10282
06:49:53,400 --> 06:49:55,080
Now the question is...

10283
06:49:55,080 --> 06:49:57,540
Zen or Ana?

10284
06:49:57,640 --> 06:49:58,440
I'm gonna go Zenyatta.

10285
06:49:58,440 --> 06:49:59,580
The trans.

10286
06:49:59,840 --> 06:50:01,580
The trans might be clutch.

10287
06:50:02,020 --> 06:50:04,420
The trans could be clutch.

10288
06:50:04,780 --> 06:50:06,000
That's all I'm saying.

10289
06:50:09,140 --> 06:50:10,720
This could be it.

10290
06:50:11,000 --> 06:50:12,860
We might need this for the trans.

10291
06:50:14,400 --> 06:50:15,880
I like the mp.

10292
06:50:24,900 --> 06:50:25,880
We're so close.

10293
06:50:26,480 --> 06:50:28,420
Guys, we're almost there.

10294
06:50:28,420 --> 06:50:34,500
I think the craziest part is this might be the longest stream I've done on this channel so far.

10295
06:50:38,480 --> 06:50:40,400
I don't have a problem.

10296
06:50:40,600 --> 06:50:42,440
I can stop at any time.

10297
06:50:43,540 --> 06:50:45,160
So far, yes.

10298
06:50:46,180 --> 06:50:47,960
I swear I can stop.

10299
06:50:48,100 --> 06:50:49,160
Resident Evil was 7 hours?

10300
06:50:53,630 --> 06:50:54,550
But don't worry.

10301
06:51:01,130 --> 06:51:01,230
I have something to say...

10302
06:51:06,620 --> 06:51:08,960
It's not about the gaining of ELO's.

10303
06:51:09,040 --> 06:51:10,880
It's about the friends we made all along.

10304
06:51:18,210 --> 06:51:20,990
Okay, he got fucking deleted.

10305
06:51:21,530 --> 06:51:23,150
Oh my god!

10306
06:51:28,630 --> 06:51:29,910
Big damage.

10307
06:51:30,030 --> 06:51:31,110
They're on Bastion now.

10308
06:51:31,650 --> 06:51:32,290
Christ.

10309
06:51:32,690 --> 06:51:34,170
And they're on Hanzo instead of Genji.

10310
06:51:34,170 --> 06:51:35,910
That damage was crazy.

10311
06:51:36,570 --> 06:51:38,210
What friends did you make?

10312
06:51:38,390 --> 06:51:39,170
You guys!

10313
06:51:41,950 --> 06:51:42,990
You guys!

10314
06:51:44,290 --> 06:51:45,430
Someone's gonna be like, you?

10315
06:51:45,630 --> 06:51:46,210
Paralysis?

10316
06:51:46,690 --> 06:51:47,350
Parasocialist?

10317
06:51:49,880 --> 06:51:50,770
You guys!

10318
06:51:50,770 --> 06:51:51,350
Guys!

10319
06:51:55,130 --> 06:51:55,790
Okay,

10320
06:52:06,710 --> 06:52:07,310
I got it.

10321
06:52:07,310 --> 06:52:07,570
Nice.

10322
06:52:07,990 --> 06:52:08,930
That's okay.

10323
06:52:10,330 --> 06:52:11,650
Parasocial Andy!

10324
06:52:12,330 --> 06:52:13,150
Woah!

10325
06:52:19,100 --> 06:52:19,510
Woo!

10326
06:52:23,950 --> 06:52:25,330
She's still up top?

10327
06:52:26,550 --> 06:52:27,590
Here we go.

10328
06:52:31,310 --> 06:52:31,970
Here we go.

10329
06:52:32,090 --> 06:52:32,990
We're alive!

10330
06:52:33,650 --> 06:52:34,690
We're alive!

10331
06:52:35,390 --> 06:52:36,170
We're alive!

10332
06:52:36,490 --> 06:52:37,290
We're alive!

10333
06:52:42,970 --> 06:52:44,750
Don't you beat Parasocial!

10334
06:52:44,790 --> 06:52:46,210
I am uncomfortable!

10335
06:52:49,090 --> 06:52:50,410
I'm killing myself.

10336
06:52:50,790 --> 06:52:51,570
Woah!

10337
06:52:56,750 --> 06:53:00,110
I'm sorry, but I prefer you as a streamer.

10338
06:53:10,060 --> 06:53:11,490
What the fuck?

10339
06:53:12,450 --> 06:53:13,230
Woah.

10340
06:53:16,390 --> 06:53:17,190
He's still up top in our spawn.

10341
06:53:17,670 --> 06:53:18,690
He's one more on top.

10342
06:53:20,390 --> 06:53:21,410
It's okay, guys!

10343
06:53:21,850 --> 06:53:23,770
My Discord is still on him!

10344
06:53:24,050 --> 06:53:24,470
I think?

10345
06:53:25,490 --> 06:53:26,550
We did it!

10346
06:53:26,890 --> 06:53:30,870
Oh my god, we actually did it.

10347
06:53:31,030 --> 06:53:32,710
Holy shit!

10348
06:53:34,590 --> 06:53:36,410
We actually did it.

10349
06:53:38,110 --> 06:53:39,710
Kick them off, boy.

10350
06:53:40,870 --> 06:53:41,830
Doki, come on!

10351
06:53:41,890 --> 06:53:42,750
Kick them off, boy!

10352
06:53:43,970 --> 06:53:45,250
Give us the content!

10353
06:53:45,450 --> 06:53:45,890
Look at me.

10354
06:53:45,930 --> 06:53:46,190
There's me.

10355
06:53:46,390 --> 06:53:47,130
Do you guys see me?

10356
06:53:47,190 --> 06:53:48,150
There I am!

10357
06:53:48,390 --> 06:53:49,210
I'm over here.

10358
06:53:49,290 --> 06:53:49,730
Do you see me?

10359
06:53:50,010 --> 06:53:51,030
I'm on the news!

10360
06:53:51,690 --> 06:53:53,330
Just like BBC News.

10361
06:53:55,030 --> 06:53:58,390
We're going to beat the longest win streak.

10362
06:53:58,830 --> 06:53:59,810
Oh my god.

10363
06:53:59,830 --> 06:54:00,410
It was unexpected?

10364
06:54:01,070 --> 06:54:01,290
How?

10365
06:54:01,550 --> 06:54:02,630
I'm going to use the bathroom.

10366
06:54:03,250 --> 06:54:04,350
I'll be right back.

10367
06:54:04,390 --> 06:54:05,330
How is that unexpected?

10368
06:55:01,230 --> 06:55:02,030
I'm back.

10369
06:55:02,130 --> 06:55:02,330
Oh!

10370
06:55:03,070 --> 06:55:04,590
I hate this map!

10371
06:55:05,650 --> 06:55:06,210
No!

10372
06:55:07,410 --> 06:55:07,970
No!

10373
06:55:08,770 --> 06:55:13,010
Out of all the maps, there had to be this one.

10374
06:55:13,650 --> 06:55:18,590
Out of every single one of the maps, there had to be this map!

10375
06:55:19,450 --> 06:55:20,010
No!

10376
06:55:21,670 --> 06:55:23,270
And he's on Lucio!

10377
06:55:25,190 --> 06:55:26,530
Okay, this is it.

10378
06:55:27,230 --> 06:55:27,950
Guys, no.

10379
06:55:28,010 --> 06:55:30,110
The reason why I'm playing Kiriko is because I have to.

10380
06:55:30,110 --> 06:55:30,170
I'm playing Kiriko because I have to.

10381
06:55:30,190 --> 06:55:31,670
Because he's on Lucio.

10382
06:55:32,090 --> 06:55:32,090
Yo, yo, yo.

10383
06:55:32,090 --> 06:55:33,130
How you guys doing?

10384
06:55:33,450 --> 06:55:34,950
Wait, but I could play Ana.

10385
06:55:36,730 --> 06:55:38,450
Final boss Nuchucks.

10386
06:55:39,330 --> 06:55:40,230
What's wrong with it?

10387
06:55:40,250 --> 06:55:41,610
Nuchucks City is fucking terrible.

10388
06:55:41,790 --> 06:55:42,670
That's what's wrong with it.

10389
06:55:42,710 --> 06:55:43,470
It's a terrible map.

10390
06:55:43,590 --> 06:55:44,250
I hate this map.

10391
06:55:45,370 --> 06:55:46,970
It's the worst map they've ever made.

10392
06:55:50,010 --> 06:55:55,590
If any Blizzard devs are watching this right now, I love every map.

10393
06:55:56,010 --> 06:55:56,490
I love every map.

10394
06:55:56,490 --> 06:55:57,370
Oh my god!

10395
06:55:57,430 --> 06:55:57,770
Okay.

10396
06:55:58,070 --> 06:55:59,270
Oh my god!

10397
06:55:59,390 --> 06:55:59,390
Okay.

10398
06:56:00,390 --> 06:56:01,810
Okay, funny story.

10399
06:56:02,150 --> 06:56:04,910
Okay, this is like a little embarrassing too.

10400
06:56:05,370 --> 06:56:06,350
But like...

10401
06:56:06,350 --> 06:56:06,550
Hahaha!

10402
06:56:09,630 --> 06:56:10,070
Oh...

10403
06:56:11,250 --> 06:56:12,130
We already lost.

10404
06:56:13,970 --> 06:56:15,530
Okay, I'll tell the story later.

10405
06:56:16,150 --> 06:56:17,730
I'm leaving you guys on the cliffhanger.

10406
06:56:18,270 --> 06:56:19,070
Funny story.

10407
06:56:19,250 --> 06:56:19,750
There you go.

10408
06:56:19,770 --> 06:56:20,230
That's all.

10409
06:56:20,610 --> 06:56:21,050
Hahaha!

10410
06:56:22,590 --> 06:56:24,630
If only you'll know what the story was.

10411
06:56:25,770 --> 06:56:27,190
I guess you'll never know.

10412
06:56:28,950 --> 06:56:30,170
It's too bad you'll never know.

10413
06:56:30,190 --> 06:56:31,710
You'll never know what the story was, guys.

10414
06:56:35,270 --> 06:56:36,630
Oh my god.

10415
06:56:36,950 --> 06:56:37,690
Oh my god.

10416
06:56:38,350 --> 06:56:38,830
Guys!

10417
06:56:39,110 --> 06:56:41,050
There's a Jugrat behind us!

10418
06:56:41,490 --> 06:56:41,970
Guys!

10419
06:56:41,970 --> 06:56:41,970
There's a Jugrat behind us!

10420
06:56:41,970 --> 06:56:42,590
So funny.

10421
06:56:42,990 --> 06:56:43,470
Hahaha!

10422
06:56:46,070 --> 06:56:47,030
Okay, guys.

10423
06:56:47,190 --> 06:56:47,490
Alright.

10424
06:56:47,750 --> 06:56:48,530
Doki, please.

10425
06:56:48,590 --> 06:56:49,650
We can't keep affording pain.

10426
06:56:49,770 --> 06:56:51,170
Your hatred is our key.

10427
06:56:51,470 --> 06:56:54,290
Thank you for the super chat.

10428
06:56:54,430 --> 06:56:55,290
Thank you.

10429
06:56:55,350 --> 06:56:56,410
Okay, funny story.

10430
06:56:56,890 --> 06:56:58,350
I don't remember when this was.

10431
06:56:58,470 --> 06:57:00,030
I think this was like one or two years ago.

10432
06:57:00,190 --> 06:57:00,430
Or something.

10433
06:57:00,770 --> 06:57:04,050
And I got invited to do a testing of Overwatch 2.

10434
06:57:04,310 --> 06:57:04,950
Or something.

10435
06:57:05,210 --> 06:57:05,870
I think it was like...

10436
06:57:05,870 --> 06:57:09,710
Like a testing of...

10437
06:57:09,710 --> 06:57:10,670
Not testing.

10438
06:57:10,850 --> 06:57:11,070
Oh yeah.

10439
06:57:11,210 --> 06:57:11,950
Not testing.

10440
06:57:12,050 --> 06:57:12,270
Sorry.

10441
06:57:12,410 --> 06:57:16,130
It was some fucking in-house scrims or something.

10442
06:57:16,910 --> 06:57:17,350
With...

10443
06:57:18,430 --> 06:57:20,490
With a bunch of Overwatch content creators.

10444
06:57:20,670 --> 06:57:21,350
And I was like, oh cool.

10445
06:57:21,430 --> 06:57:22,950
I didn't stream it because I was tired.

10446
06:57:23,470 --> 06:57:24,850
So then I joined it.

10447
06:57:24,970 --> 06:57:27,430
What I didn't realize is that...

10448
06:57:28,170 --> 06:57:29,130
Devs were...

10449
06:57:29,130 --> 06:57:29,830
Hahaha!

10450
06:57:31,970 --> 06:57:33,710
Devs were part of it.

10451
06:57:34,310 --> 06:57:36,470
So I didn't realize this.

10452
06:57:36,830 --> 06:57:37,170
So I didn't realize this.

10453
06:57:37,170 --> 06:57:39,250
And then so one of the content creators...

10454
06:57:39,250 --> 06:57:41,610
Was asking for my opinion...

10455
06:57:41,610 --> 06:57:43,130
On Overwatch 2.

10456
06:57:43,450 --> 06:57:45,030
And I straight up was like...

10457
06:57:45,030 --> 06:57:45,390
I don't know.

10458
06:57:45,470 --> 06:57:46,650
It's just Overwatch 1.

10459
06:57:46,750 --> 06:57:47,730
It's just the maps are different.

10460
06:57:47,950 --> 06:57:48,950
Except like, oh you know.

10461
06:57:51,210 --> 06:57:53,830
Just the maps are like a little different.

10462
06:57:53,970 --> 06:57:56,810
Like oh, one of the maps is just like nighttime and daytime.

10463
06:57:57,150 --> 06:57:57,210
Like oh, one of the maps is just like nighttime and daytime.

10464
06:57:57,430 --> 06:57:59,290
And then all my team was...

10465
06:57:59,290 --> 06:57:59,870
Hahaha!

10466
06:58:02,330 --> 06:58:03,170
Hahaha!

10467
06:58:04,330 --> 06:58:07,630
All my team were Overwatch devs!

10468
06:58:08,050 --> 06:58:09,230
Can we save now for uh...

10469
06:58:09,230 --> 06:58:09,490
H?

10470
06:58:10,270 --> 06:58:11,110
Hahaha!

10471
06:58:11,110 --> 06:58:11,770
Hahaha!

10472
06:58:13,910 --> 06:58:16,530
I think like...

10473
06:58:18,250 --> 06:58:19,090
So...

10474
06:58:19,090 --> 06:58:20,710
Yeah, that...

10475
06:58:21,090 --> 06:58:23,670
That was a Doki moment right there.

10476
06:58:23,790 --> 06:58:24,570
It was...

10477
06:58:24,570 --> 06:58:25,290
Yup.

10478
06:58:25,570 --> 06:58:26,730
That's a...

10479
06:58:27,530 --> 06:58:28,390
And then...

10480
06:58:28,390 --> 06:58:31,510
And then I remember one of the content creators was like...

10481
06:58:31,510 --> 06:58:33,430
Well, obviously...

10482
06:58:33,430 --> 06:58:34,270
Like uh...

10483
06:58:34,270 --> 06:58:36,770
This guy is the developer.

10484
06:58:36,950 --> 06:58:38,430
Maybe he could take that as...

10485
06:58:39,030 --> 06:58:39,630
Feedback.

10486
06:58:40,170 --> 06:58:42,930
And I was like... Oh shit!

10487
06:58:43,630 --> 06:58:44,950
I was just like...

10488
06:58:44,950 --> 06:58:46,030
Oh wait!

10489
06:58:47,090 --> 06:58:48,150
Devs are here?

10490
06:58:49,830 --> 06:58:50,810
Devs are...

10491
06:58:51,410 --> 06:58:53,750
Devs are part of the fucking scrims?

10492
06:58:53,770 --> 06:58:53,910
Oh!

10493
06:58:56,090 --> 06:58:57,130
This is a...

10494
06:58:57,430 --> 06:58:58,570
Certified Doki moment.

10495
06:58:59,550 --> 06:59:00,250
Very...

10496
06:59:00,250 --> 06:59:02,110
Certified Doki moment.

10497
06:59:02,330 --> 06:59:02,850
Definitely.

10498
06:59:05,090 --> 06:59:07,770
I would have logged off...

10499
06:59:07,770 --> 06:59:10,250
And changed my name!

10500
06:59:11,350 --> 06:59:11,470
Hahaha!

10501
06:59:13,510 --> 06:59:14,210
Hahaha!

10502
06:59:14,490 --> 06:59:16,830
I was like... It's just Overwatch 1.

10503
06:59:17,050 --> 06:59:18,170
Like I was like...

10504
06:59:18,170 --> 06:59:19,510
That's what I said!

10505
06:59:19,750 --> 06:59:22,030
I was like... It's just Overwatch 1.

10506
06:59:22,110 --> 06:59:23,070
Like the maps are just like...

10507
06:59:23,070 --> 06:59:23,930
Like... Oh!

10508
06:59:24,090 --> 06:59:25,930
There's new maps but it's just like...

10509
06:59:25,930 --> 06:59:26,890
Daytime and nighttime.

10510
06:59:27,510 --> 06:59:28,010
Hahaha!

10511
06:59:33,730 --> 06:59:34,490
Oh!

10512
06:59:34,670 --> 06:59:35,070
It's me.

10513
06:59:35,390 --> 06:59:37,170
Can you kill the Larry?

10514
06:59:38,930 --> 06:59:39,450
It's me.

10515
06:59:39,970 --> 06:59:41,670
You weren't lying!

10516
06:59:46,380 --> 06:59:47,500
So yeah...

10517
06:59:47,500 --> 06:59:48,520
That was...

10518
06:59:48,520 --> 06:59:51,840
The hated Doki because she told the truth.

10519
06:59:52,180 --> 06:59:54,020
I can't believe it.

10520
06:59:54,100 --> 06:59:54,940
I can't believe it.

10521
06:59:54,940 --> 06:59:55,280
I got baited.

10522
06:59:55,300 --> 06:59:57,900
I got baited into saying my thoughts.

10523
06:59:58,080 --> 06:59:58,440
Because...

10524
06:59:58,440 --> 07:00:00,820
When the Conicators asked for my opinion.

10525
07:00:01,060 --> 07:00:02,960
And then I didn't realize...

10526
07:00:02,960 --> 07:00:05,460
I didn't realize...

10527
07:00:05,460 --> 07:00:06,320
It was...

10528
07:00:06,320 --> 07:00:08,680
We had devs in the team.

10529
07:00:08,860 --> 07:00:09,220
Oh my god!

10530
07:00:09,220 --> 07:00:09,720
Let's go!

10531
07:00:19,550 --> 07:00:20,350
Just fine.

10532
07:00:20,690 --> 07:00:22,130
Get baited, nerd.

10533
07:00:22,590 --> 07:00:23,310
Hahaha!

10534
07:00:24,050 --> 07:00:25,970
I got set up!

10535
07:00:26,810 --> 07:00:29,170
I got fucking set up!

10536
07:00:29,270 --> 07:00:30,450
I got fucking set up!

10537
07:00:35,660 --> 07:00:36,300
Oh!

10538
07:00:36,440 --> 07:00:37,580
This is a little awkward.

10539
07:00:38,300 --> 07:00:38,940
Hahaha!

10540
07:00:40,440 --> 07:00:41,080
Thanks!

10541
07:00:44,960 --> 07:00:45,600
Whoa!

10542
07:00:46,840 --> 07:00:47,080
Whoa!

10543
07:00:49,240 --> 07:00:50,480
He's like one hit.

10544
07:00:51,340 --> 07:00:52,480
He's like one hit.

10545
07:00:52,480 --> 07:00:53,060
Oh shit!

10546
07:00:53,460 --> 07:00:53,580
No!

10547
07:00:53,680 --> 07:00:54,320
Don't look at that!

10548
07:00:55,380 --> 07:00:56,020
Nice!

10549
07:00:56,720 --> 07:00:58,320
Literally left him.

10550
07:00:58,880 --> 07:00:59,480
Oh!

10551
07:01:02,740 --> 07:01:03,740
There's a Weedo.

10552
07:01:04,700 --> 07:01:05,600
Feel the Weedo.

10553
07:01:08,300 --> 07:01:09,200
Okay, we got this.

10554
07:01:10,220 --> 07:01:10,700
Oh!

10555
07:01:10,740 --> 07:01:11,360
Poor Lucio.

10556
07:01:11,660 --> 07:01:12,980
I'm heading over to the point.

10557
07:01:15,320 --> 07:01:16,120
We got it.

10558
07:01:19,120 --> 07:01:20,140
Oh, I hear them.

10559
07:01:22,380 --> 07:01:22,860
Oh!

10560
07:01:22,960 --> 07:01:24,440
He got baited!

10561
07:01:24,440 --> 07:01:27,680
Just like how I got baited into Shintaka Overwatch in front of devs!

10562
07:01:28,260 --> 07:01:28,740
Hahaha!

10563
07:01:30,800 --> 07:01:32,300
Almost the same thing.

10564
07:01:32,440 --> 07:01:33,420
I'm not even gonna say anything.

10565
07:01:33,440 --> 07:01:33,820
I'm just gonna say...

10566
07:01:34,560 --> 07:01:35,640
Oh yeah!

10567
07:01:36,080 --> 07:01:37,280
Oh yes!

10568
07:01:40,120 --> 07:01:40,760
Hahaha!

10569
07:01:40,960 --> 07:01:41,160
Hahaha!

10570
07:01:41,560 --> 07:01:43,180
Almost the same thing.

10571
07:01:43,840 --> 07:01:45,540
Now he knows your pain.

10572
07:01:46,540 --> 07:01:50,220
The thing is, it wasn't one Overwatch devs.

10573
07:01:50,280 --> 07:01:52,640
It was like two Overwatch devs on my team.

10574
07:01:52,900 --> 07:01:53,420
So...

10575
07:01:53,420 --> 07:01:54,000
Hahaha!

10576
07:01:54,760 --> 07:01:55,380
Hahaha!

10577
07:01:57,100 --> 07:01:59,980
And this is when Overwatch 2 just came out.

10578
07:02:00,220 --> 07:02:01,600
That was like...

10579
07:02:01,600 --> 07:02:03,800
It gets... I like how at the moment, I'm like...

10580
07:02:03,820 --> 07:02:05,340
The more I talk about this, the worse it gets.

10581
07:02:05,460 --> 07:02:07,460
It was when it just came out too.

10582
07:02:12,000 --> 07:02:14,240
It was even more awkward.

10583
07:02:14,560 --> 07:02:15,660
Did they say anything?

10584
07:02:15,700 --> 07:02:16,520
I don't remember.

10585
07:02:16,580 --> 07:02:17,680
I was so embarrassed.

10586
07:02:18,080 --> 07:02:18,640
I...

10587
07:02:18,640 --> 07:02:22,760
I was so embarrassed with everything that happened.

10588
07:02:22,880 --> 07:02:24,740
I actually don't remember.

10589
07:02:28,660 --> 07:02:29,220
No!

10590
07:02:29,620 --> 07:02:30,240
It's okay.

10591
07:02:30,320 --> 07:02:31,360
I need to play Kiriko anyway.

10592
07:02:31,440 --> 07:02:33,120
Because they went fucking Ana.

10593
07:02:34,140 --> 07:02:36,160
Life flash before your ass.

10594
07:02:37,020 --> 07:02:37,980
That's fine.

10595
07:02:38,420 --> 07:02:40,700
The blackout from anxiety.

10596
07:02:41,340 --> 07:02:42,000
The rush that you involved.

10597
07:02:42,000 --> 07:02:43,680
Bro, block the memories.

10598
07:02:44,440 --> 07:02:46,920
You would block the memories too!

10599
07:02:47,080 --> 07:02:47,860
What do you mean?

10600
07:02:48,640 --> 07:02:49,240
Hahaha!

10601
07:02:49,480 --> 07:02:50,080
Imagine!

10602
07:02:54,720 --> 07:02:55,640
Oh yeah!

10603
07:02:55,780 --> 07:02:56,820
Yeah, just something similar.

10604
07:02:56,940 --> 07:02:57,940
Thank you for the super chat.

10605
07:02:58,040 --> 07:02:58,620
Thank you.

10606
07:02:58,660 --> 07:03:01,360
I called the playtesters and some of the devs.

10607
07:03:01,360 --> 07:03:02,760
And Apex bots.

10608
07:03:03,220 --> 07:03:04,560
Because I was like...

10609
07:03:05,380 --> 07:03:05,820
Oh my god!

10610
07:03:05,880 --> 07:03:06,980
You guys are real play...

10611
07:03:06,980 --> 07:03:07,800
Oh shit.

10612
07:03:09,220 --> 07:03:11,400
Because I got invited to an Apex playtest.

10613
07:03:11,800 --> 07:03:12,660
And then...

10614
07:03:13,740 --> 07:03:15,000
I was just like...

10615
07:03:15,000 --> 07:03:17,040
I was like... wait, these are real people.

10616
07:03:17,180 --> 07:03:19,260
Because like... I thought like...

10617
07:03:19,260 --> 07:03:21,240
people on my team and also like the people...

10618
07:03:21,240 --> 07:03:23,240
on the enemy teams were like...

10619
07:03:23,240 --> 07:03:23,580
bots.

10620
07:03:23,760 --> 07:03:24,660
Like actual bots.

10621
07:03:25,320 --> 07:03:27,140
And then I realized... wait a minute.

10622
07:03:27,660 --> 07:03:30,080
They're actually like sort of communicating in text.

10623
07:03:30,200 --> 07:03:31,480
And I was like... are you guys real pe...

10624
07:03:31,480 --> 07:03:31,940
Oh my god!

10625
07:03:31,960 --> 07:03:33,420
You guys are real fucking divas.

10626
07:03:35,380 --> 07:03:36,140
I'm gonna...

10627
07:03:36,780 --> 07:03:38,620
I'm gonna go here and then...

10628
07:03:38,620 --> 07:03:39,180
slash.

10629
07:03:39,480 --> 07:03:39,700
Woah.

10630
07:03:41,260 --> 07:03:42,660
Yeah, I go soon though.

10631
07:03:44,620 --> 07:03:45,620
Oh no.

10632
07:03:46,880 --> 07:03:47,700
We'll be fine.

10633
07:03:48,400 --> 07:03:48,400
We'll be fine.

10634
07:03:48,540 --> 07:03:49,360
We'll be fine.

10635
07:03:50,740 --> 07:03:52,200
Someone needs to touch.

10636
07:03:52,460 --> 07:03:53,740
Can we touch this thing?

10637
07:03:54,620 --> 07:03:55,500
We'll be fine.

10638
07:03:58,080 --> 07:03:58,940
We'll be fine.

10639
07:03:59,460 --> 07:04:00,380
We'll be fine.

10640
07:04:02,160 --> 07:04:04,300
I have the TP but we'll be fine.

10641
07:04:05,420 --> 07:04:06,060
Okay.

10642
07:04:12,780 --> 07:04:14,180
Oh my god.

10643
07:04:14,320 --> 07:04:15,380
He's going all the way over.

10644
07:04:17,180 --> 07:04:18,840
He's going around the world.

10645
07:04:19,000 --> 07:04:20,140
Around the world.

10646
07:04:20,420 --> 07:04:22,520
We did it!

10647
07:04:23,340 --> 07:04:24,980
We fucking did it!

10648
07:04:26,400 --> 07:04:27,360
It's over!

10649
07:04:27,640 --> 07:04:31,660
We ended on NewJunkCity while telling a story.

10650
07:04:32,000 --> 07:04:34,920
This is the game I've tried the least.

10651
07:04:35,480 --> 07:04:35,860
And we won.

10652
07:04:36,080 --> 07:04:38,700
I can't fucking believe it's over.

10653
07:04:39,320 --> 07:04:41,040
It's fucking over.

10654
07:04:41,380 --> 07:04:42,100
Jeez.

10655
07:04:43,960 --> 07:04:46,860
That's the last game for me.

10656
07:04:48,720 --> 07:04:50,380
It's actually over.

10657
07:04:52,300 --> 07:04:53,940
Oh my god.

10658
07:04:54,080 --> 07:04:55,320
We did it.

10659
07:04:55,460 --> 07:04:56,180
And so...

10660
07:04:59,460 --> 07:05:00,840
Overthinking was...

10661
07:05:01,160 --> 07:05:02,380
was the answer.

10662
07:05:02,500 --> 07:05:03,640
We did it.

10663
07:05:03,700 --> 07:05:05,220
I told you we'd be in Masters.

10664
07:05:05,480 --> 07:05:05,720
Guys.

10665
07:05:06,140 --> 07:05:08,560
I fucking told you.

10666
07:05:10,320 --> 07:05:11,360
I told you.

10667
07:05:11,440 --> 07:05:11,580
I told you.

10668
07:05:11,580 --> 07:05:11,960
No clickbait.

10669
07:05:12,200 --> 07:05:14,440
There was no clickbait chat.

10670
07:05:14,720 --> 07:05:16,620
It actually happened.

10671
07:05:17,040 --> 07:05:18,120
I was here.

10672
07:05:19,440 --> 07:05:20,620
Oh my god.

10673
07:05:21,040 --> 07:05:22,220
Sean, thank you for the machete.

10674
07:05:22,300 --> 07:05:23,380
Thank you.

10675
07:05:23,440 --> 07:05:23,900
Congrats.

10676
07:05:24,220 --> 07:05:25,340
We all know you can do it.

10677
07:05:25,460 --> 07:05:29,240
Now here's the insurance for the real content to take placement.

10678
07:05:30,140 --> 07:05:30,740
Guys.

10679
07:05:31,020 --> 07:05:32,040
I'm like...

10680
07:05:32,040 --> 07:05:34,200
I don't hate myself that much.

10681
07:05:34,400 --> 07:05:37,360
I might hate myself enough to play seven hours of Overwatch.

10682
07:05:37,680 --> 07:05:40,040
But not to the point where I play tank.

10683
07:05:40,700 --> 07:05:41,700
Thank you to the super chat.

10684
07:05:41,760 --> 07:05:42,020
Thank you.

10685
07:05:42,040 --> 07:05:42,620
Thank you.

10686
07:05:42,620 --> 07:05:43,100
Guys.

10687
07:05:43,240 --> 07:05:44,000
Thank you to the super chat.

10688
07:05:44,060 --> 07:05:44,320
Thank you.

10689
07:05:44,320 --> 07:05:44,940
Thank you.

10690
07:05:44,940 --> 07:05:47,720
The head empty Zatsu buff is real.

10691
07:05:47,920 --> 07:05:49,040
Thank you to the super chat.

10692
07:05:49,180 --> 07:05:49,540
Thank you.

10693
07:05:49,580 --> 07:05:50,120
Thank you.

10694
07:05:50,460 --> 07:05:50,940
Daniel.

10695
07:05:51,020 --> 07:05:52,300
Welcome to the Romina farm.

10696
07:05:52,480 --> 07:05:52,840
Welcome.

10697
07:05:52,920 --> 07:05:53,240
Welcome.

10698
07:05:53,380 --> 07:05:54,260
We did it guys.

10699
07:05:56,240 --> 07:05:59,100
The insurance finally paid off.

10700
07:06:01,060 --> 07:06:02,020
The insurance finally paid off.

10701
07:06:02,020 --> 07:06:03,660
We did it.

10702
07:06:05,600 --> 07:06:08,720
The insurance paid off chat.

10703
07:06:10,680 --> 07:06:12,280
I told you, Bacon.

10704
07:06:12,640 --> 07:06:14,080
Bacon, you were there.

10705
07:06:14,220 --> 07:06:15,680
Unless Bacon went to sleep.

10706
07:06:15,880 --> 07:06:17,620
Bacon, you were here.

10707
07:06:17,900 --> 07:06:20,960
I like to thank Bacon for sponsoring my insurance.

10708
07:06:20,960 --> 07:06:22,460
The last couple of games.

10709
07:06:22,760 --> 07:06:25,900
And also to all the other dragoons that betted against me.

10710
07:06:25,940 --> 07:06:27,400
And tried to gamble with my games.

10711
07:06:27,640 --> 07:06:31,200
And also to the dragoons that sponsored my insurance as well.

10712
07:06:31,420 --> 07:06:32,000
I have a lot of fans.

10713
07:06:32,020 --> 07:06:33,860
I would like to thank them all.

10714
07:06:36,080 --> 07:06:37,600
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

10715
07:06:37,680 --> 07:06:37,940
Thank you.

10716
07:06:37,960 --> 07:06:38,400
Thank you.

10717
07:06:38,460 --> 07:06:42,500
All Dokyu had to do was relax her yap muscles and easy win happens.

10718
07:06:42,620 --> 07:06:43,400
Simple as...

10719
07:06:46,160 --> 07:06:53,460
Two shout out to like Ruben for playing... for playing with me, for asking to play with me and then...

10720
07:06:54,160 --> 07:06:57,540
And then my actual insurance was Ruben.

10721
07:06:58,620 --> 07:07:01,220
Yeah, never doubted for a second.

10722
07:07:02,020 --> 07:07:03,600
Yeah, yeah, sure.

10723
07:07:04,300 --> 07:07:05,580
That's fucking right.

10724
07:07:05,700 --> 07:07:07,840
Yeah, you totally never doubted me.

10725
07:07:08,320 --> 07:07:09,320
At all.

10726
07:07:12,820 --> 07:07:15,460
I definitely believe all of you.

10727
07:07:16,180 --> 07:07:16,720
Nothing.

10728
07:07:16,820 --> 07:07:17,140
Thank you.

10729
07:07:17,140 --> 07:07:18,560
Thank you for the one get the chip.

10730
07:07:18,680 --> 07:07:18,960
Thank you.

10731
07:07:19,040 --> 07:07:19,560
Thank you.

10732
07:07:21,360 --> 07:07:23,580
Ruben the Gopher playing six hours straight with you.

10733
07:07:23,680 --> 07:07:28,380
But Ruben streams 15 to 18 plus hours of Overwatch.

10734
07:07:28,680 --> 07:07:31,960
Playing six hours with me for him is nothing.

10735
07:07:32,020 --> 07:07:36,160
He solo queues 15 plus hours sometimes and like...

10736
07:07:39,740 --> 07:07:42,540
That's like different from what he does with me.

10737
07:07:44,140 --> 07:07:45,380
Tang, thank you for the super chat.

10738
07:07:45,440 --> 07:07:45,700
Thank you.

10739
07:07:45,740 --> 07:07:46,000
Thank you.

10740
07:07:46,000 --> 07:07:47,100
We don't need sleep play.

10741
07:07:48,840 --> 07:07:49,480
It's okay.

10742
07:07:49,740 --> 07:07:50,680
It's okay Tang.

10743
07:07:50,840 --> 07:07:54,660
We have we have another stream today in an hour and a half guys.

10744
07:07:54,840 --> 07:07:58,300
In an hour and a half, we have stream number two, everybody.

10745
07:07:58,640 --> 07:08:00,560
But for now, we are free from Overwatch.

10746
07:08:00,760 --> 07:08:02,000
Is this actually the longest stream?

10747
07:08:02,000 --> 07:08:02,860
This is the longest stream I've ever done.

10748
07:08:04,200 --> 07:08:06,380
Audio, thank you for the five gifted chips!

10749
07:08:06,620 --> 07:08:07,540
Thank you, thank you!

10750
07:08:08,040 --> 07:08:08,920
I'm gonna check.

10751
07:08:09,160 --> 07:08:10,380
Is this actually?

10752
07:08:10,980 --> 07:08:11,380
Okay.

10753
07:08:13,500 --> 07:08:13,900
LGS...

10754
07:08:14,840 --> 07:08:16,780
This is the longest stream I've ever done.

10755
07:08:17,060 --> 07:08:19,700
This is actually the longest stream I've ever done is, of course, Overwatch.

10756
07:08:20,000 --> 07:08:21,540
I'm not even tired from Overwatch.

10757
07:08:21,700 --> 07:08:22,480
I honestly...

10758
07:08:23,000 --> 07:08:25,340
If I didn't have a second stream, I'd keep going.

10759
07:08:25,520 --> 07:08:26,260
But like...

10760
07:08:28,040 --> 07:08:29,180
But I have a second stream.

10761
07:08:29,360 --> 07:08:30,860
So I'm gonna call it here, everybody.

10762
07:08:30,860 --> 07:08:35,260
I hope you guys all had a great time hanging out with me for the Overwatch section.

10763
07:08:35,820 --> 07:08:39,360
We still have a second stream tonight with Goodnight Dragoons.

10764
07:08:39,860 --> 07:08:40,900
But anyway, everybody.

10765
07:08:41,440 --> 07:08:43,400
As always, everyone stay hydrated.

10766
07:08:43,960 --> 07:08:44,620
Posture check.

10767
07:08:44,700 --> 07:08:46,840
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

10768
07:08:46,960 --> 07:08:48,680
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

10769
07:08:48,800 --> 07:08:49,900
Because you deserve it!

10770
07:08:50,040 --> 07:08:51,060
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

10771
07:08:51,380 --> 07:08:53,460
Or see you guys in the next second stream.

10772
07:08:54,300 --> 07:08:55,060
Bye, everyone!

10773
07:08:55,740 --> 07:08:56,180
Bye!
