1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,980
Hello

2
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,160
everybody!

3
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,820
Hello, hello!

4
00:01:51,560 --> 00:02:00,720
It has been a very, very long time since we last streamed Marvel Rivals.

5
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,000
An entire three whole days.

6
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,040
Oh my god.

7
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,260
We might as well be dead already.

8
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,660
Oh my god.

9
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,800
It felt so long.

10
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,280
I can't believe we get to be back with Marvel Rivals.

11
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,100
What a long break we had from that game.

12
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,880
Please.

13
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:43,660
It felt like everybody got families and moved on, but I never truly moved on from Marvel Rivals.

14
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,900
Every day, every minute, I closed my eyes and I was like, I wonder what he's doing right now.

15
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,940
I wonder what Mr. Rivals is doing right now.

16
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:08,240
So, I know some people were like, Toki, I thought you said you're returning back to normal.

17
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,480
Why is there another Marvel Rivals stream?

18
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,600
I thought you're returning to normal.

19
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,420
What happened?

20
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:25,120
Guys, it's gonna be just like Apex, where I will check out the new season of a competitive shooter game.

21
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,960
You know how I checked the new season of Overwatch?

22
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,680
I haven't checked Overwatch's new hero.

23
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,480
I don't remember what his name is.

24
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,120
It's been 20 years since we divorced her.

25
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,400
We gotta move on.

26
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,160
Unless they sponsor me, of course.

27
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,780
Unless you sponsor me and I'll be back, baby.

28
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,920
I'll always come back for you, baby.

29
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,000
You were my first love.

30
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,940
You know that, right?

31
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,600
Right, girl?

32
00:03:48,600 --> 00:04:05,500
Anyway, as I was saying, just like Apex, I will be checking out the new seasons of Marvel Rivals, just like I check out every new season of Apex Legends.

33
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,060
And because of that, it's actually crazy.

34
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:18,200
The new season for Marvel Rivals basically came out with four new characters.

35
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:26,400
I believe two for now, and then they'll release two more at the half of season one.

36
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,260
Because Mr. Fantastic and Mrs. Fantastic are now available to play.

37
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:38,100
And then later on, The Thing and... what's his name?

38
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,560
Torch?

39
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:38,940
Whatever.

40
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:39,760
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,080
Chris Evans.

42
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,620
The Human Torch, yes.

43
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,160
The Human Torch will be available on a later date.

44
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,240
For now, we're gonna have two new heroes to try out.

45
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,180
A new map!

46
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,420
And obviously, like, buffs and nerfs and stuff.

47
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:11,800
We all know who the real star is for the new releases.

48
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,540
Okay, guys?

49
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,320
We all know.

50
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,980
And it's definitely not The Thing.

51
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,590
Oh, and there's a new mode as well.

52
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,670
So yeah, I'm super excited.

53
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,110
I'm really excited to try out the new things for Marvel Rivals.

54
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,950
I might play a little bit of ranked.

55
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,010
I'm not sure yet.

56
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,410
So we'll see how it goes.

57
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,190
I really do want to... I was given an option to try... I told you guys before, but like...

58
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:45,410
I was given an option to try out these characters in early access, because a lot of streamers were given the option to.

59
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:58,090
But I decided I really want to try... I figured it's time to, like, you know, take a small little...

60
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:05,890
So because of that, I decided to try out the new characters live while everyone else gets to as well.

61
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:06,830
So we'll see.

62
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:07,750
We'll see how it goes.

63
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,790
I'm super excited.

64
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,430
Also, like, I was very nervous.

65
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:22,370
I was incredibly nervous about whether or not I made it to top 500 for the season.

66
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:29,850
And, you know, by the time the stream ended, I checked the leaderboard 30 minutes before.

67
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,050
I was so nervous.

68
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,510
I was like, what if I don't make it?

69
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:39,710
I didn't play another game, because I was just like... I waited to check the last 30 minutes before the season officially ended.

70
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,630
I was like, what if I don't make it?

71
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,370
Oh my god.

72
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,190
All those hours grinding would have been nothing if I...

73
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,050
All those hours.

74
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:55,290
What if... What if everybody just suddenly climbed 15 points to overtake me?

75
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:04,130
And thankfully, by the time I checked the 30 minutes before, thankfully, the leaderboards only went up one to two points.

76
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,830
And I was like, oh, thank god.

77
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,590
Thank god all those other players' dreams and...

78
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:14,210
All those other players' dreams and determinations were crushed that day.

79
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,770
Thank fucking god that they lost hope.

80
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:26,670
I was like, thank fucking god they all... they didn't make it and their dreams were crushed.

81
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,750
I'm so happy.

82
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,830
So yes, I made it to the leaderboards.

83
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,970
I was top three...

84
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,370
Okay, okay, we gotta wait one more minute.

85
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:54,510
I was top... oh, I was top 300, I believe, in the end.

86
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,610
So, yay.

87
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,750
At least it wasn't that close.

88
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,970
Thank fucking god.

89
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,470
I was so nervous that's gonna be like...

90
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,030
I was gonna be like, rank 490 or something.

91
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,030
That was what I was really fucking scared about.

92
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,790
Uh, Daniel, thank you for the superchat.

93
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,810
Thank you, thank you.

94
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,610
Hello Doki, thoughts on Iron Fist and Diamond Plus.

95
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,890
My brother was a GM Iron Fist main, but it's hard to help him climb higher.

96
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,610
Anything helps.

97
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,510
Thank you for the superchat.

98
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,190
Thank you, thank you.

99
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:25,030
I avoid every, um... Iron Fist, like...

100
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,670
A really, really good Iron Fist is very scary to play against.

101
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,270
But also, the higher elo you go, the less effective he is.

102
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,950
Because, like, if you're gonna play Iron Fist, you might as well play Black Panther.

103
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,110
Because he's basically the better version of Iron Fist.

104
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:55,030
And, um... and he... and like... oh yeah, Mr. And like, you would get avoided by every fucking good player because they know how to counter a good Iron Fist.

105
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,110
Oh wait, did Black Panther got nerfed?

106
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,510
I didn't read the patch notes.

107
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,490
Anyway, well, never mind.

108
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,670
Forget what I said.

109
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,670
That's what you should have done last season.

110
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,270
That's what you should have done last season.

111
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,490
Iron Fist had a high win rate because less people wanted to play Iron Fist.

112
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,590
Because less people played him.

113
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,350
It's a higher win rate if there's a smaller pool of players.

114
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,690
So, never mind.

115
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,430
Black Panther might not... never mind.

116
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,970
You should have listened to this advice like an hour... like, I guess like 5 hours ago.

117
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,730
But, in that case, maybe Iron Fist is now better.

118
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,290
Well, congratulations, you got buffed.

119
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,170
But yes, a really, really good Iron Fist was very scary.

120
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:55,390
But the higher elo you go, the more people realize.

121
00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:04,190
It took me a while to realize that if an Iron Fist is diving me, that I should not shoot him.

122
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,710
I should not shoot him when he's looking at me.

123
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,370
I should have another player shoot him in the back.

124
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:16,090
Because the more he blocks, the more HP he gets.

125
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:20,870
But like, I learned that 3 days ago.

126
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:31,370
So, it took me 3 days ago to realize that, to figure that out.

127
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:36,970
But yes, the higher elo you are, the more you realize how dog shit Iron Fist is.

128
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,090
So it is easier to counter when you figure out how he's actually played.

129
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,750
But like, new season, new people.

130
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,390
So, you might succeed this time.

131
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,030
Because all the other characters got nerfed.

132
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,270
All the other melee characters essentially got nerfed.

133
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,030
Alright, let's check it out!

134
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,010
Let's check it out.

135
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,510
The block is 360.

136
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,870
Yeah, but like, it helps a lot.

137
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:03,090
Because the people in the back can help you more.

138
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,590
Because the front, he's just gonna fucking smash your face in.

139
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:17,010
But like, the people shooting him, your team can help you burn him, basically, in the end.

140
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,010
Oh, the magic got buffed.

141
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,270
Oh yeah, magic got buffed.

142
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,950
Oh my god, why did they buff magic?

143
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,270
Oh my god.

144
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,050
She's already so scary.

145
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,550
Oh my god.

146
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,630
Wait, please check your...

147
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,010
Do I have to reboot the game?

148
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,730
Do I have to restart the game to get in the server?

149
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,650
Oh my god.

150
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,900
Yeah, focus on running.

151
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,920
If you're getting targeted by Iron Fist, you just run and hope your team fucking hears you scream for help.

152
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,560
Oh, no one can get in yet?

153
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,720
Alright, that's good, that's fine, we can still talk.

154
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,900
I'm not trying to avoid you guys, like...

155
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,220
I was just really looking forward to trying out the new season.

156
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,980
Anyway, so I saw...

157
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,080
I like how a lot of people were like...

158
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,940
Doki, when are you gonna...

159
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,560
Doki, when are you gonna buy...

160
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,060
When are you gonna get the new cosmetics?

161
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,540
I refuse to get the new skins until...

162
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,400
I refuse to get the new skins until they sponsor me.

163
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,540
And then I'll...

164
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:26,080
When you see me buy a cosmetic, it's when you know I finally got sponsored.

165
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:26,840
I...

166
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:33,200
I will always be DefaultGrandee until I get sponsored.

167
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,180
And then I'll show my fucking heart out.

168
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:36,660
I...

169
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,980
I need that bag.

170
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,320
Also, I heard that they made a Bounty Hunter Raccoon skin.

171
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,060
And I'm so sad.

172
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,340
I'm like...

173
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:51,860
Of course.

174
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,180
Of course.

175
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,420
One of my most hated characters.

176
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,240
Of course he gets the fucking...

177
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,660
Of course he gets a Bounty Hunter skin.

178
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,840
Of fucking course he does.

179
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,900
That goddamn rodent.

180
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,460
Raccoon hate.

181
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,800
Anyway...

182
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,900
I heard...

183
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,740
The skins are really pretty.

184
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,620
I do have to admit.

185
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,180
The skins are really pretty.

186
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,080
But also, they're like...

187
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,120
Of characters that I don't use.

188
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,940
So like, I'm not like...

189
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,660
I'm not like...

190
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,700
No...

191
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,400
I can't...

192
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,080
Because the characters I do use...

193
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,980
I don't really like the skins.

194
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:31,860
In general.

195
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,280
Like, the Mantis skins and the Luna skins...

196
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,300
Are not like...

197
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,140
I don't like them at all.

198
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:38,840
Like, I...

199
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,500
I know like, there's the one with the helmet.

200
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,440
But like, her voice distortion...

201
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,580
With the Mantis...

202
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,140
I'm not a fan of her Mantis skin.

203
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,080
Like, I don't...

204
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,460
I don't like the...

205
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,200
The...

206
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,840
The voice distortion.

207
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,020
And just like, how it looks in general.

208
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,080
And I don't like...

209
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,140
It's just my own personal take.

210
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,900
Oh, you're in?

211
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,140
Okay, let me get in.

212
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,420
Um, but...

213
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,040
Oh, okay.

214
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,280
Login traffic is high.

215
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
Please wait in queue.

216
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,900
I'm number 174.

217
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,180
Um, and then...

218
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,500
I'm not a fan of the Luna skin.

219
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,900
Because I don't like her...

220
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,500
Costume for it.

221
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,940
I don't like the dress in general.

222
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,040
I just think it's like...

223
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,140
I was like...

224
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,880
Put on some pants.

225
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,140
You're in a war!

226
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,980
Put on some pants!

227
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:24,800
Yay!

228
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,140
I love her default outfit.

229
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,500
I really like her.

230
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,640
Also, it accentuates her assets more.

231
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,300
That's what I also like about it.

232
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,520
I think the dress covers up too much of like...

233
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,800
What I love about Luna.

234
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,140
Um...

235
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,440
Yay!

236
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:49,740
See!

237
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
That's me!

238
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,270
Yay!

239
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,110
Plat one!

240
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:58,850
What?

241
00:14:58,970 --> 00:14:59,430
I'm...

242
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,930
It only deranks me to plat one?

243
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:02,670
Really?

244
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,650
I can literally get to diamond right after?

245
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,190
What?

246
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,570
Okay, that's sweet.

247
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,390
That's cool.

248
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,170
It only deranks me to plat one.

249
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,310
Oh, and I got the golden moon knight skin.

250
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,290
For free.

251
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,110
Let's go.

252
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,370
I heard it deranks you.

253
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,550
Oh my god, yes.

254
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,950
So, I get this.

255
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,930
It tells people that...

256
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,710
It tells people that like...

257
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,710
It's so tiny.

258
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,850
I wish...

259
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:32,070
Okay, the only thing I really hate about the rewards for top 500...

260
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:32,930
Is like...

261
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,690
Look how fucking tiny this is.

262
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,230
This is literally...

263
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,930
This is literally the only...

264
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,090
The way people know you got top 500.

265
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,650
It's like in the corner of your banner.

266
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,970
And it's like...

267
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:45,870
Here it is.

268
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,610
You get like a fucking magnifying glass.

269
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,270
And it's like...

270
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:50,990
There it is.

271
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,330
There's my top 500.

272
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,570
It's kinda small, but it's there, guys.

273
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,990
Um...

274
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,650
Excuse me, Doki.

275
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,310
That's average size.

276
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,370
I'm sorry, guys.

277
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:02,930
I'm sorry.

278
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,790
What?

279
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:06,790
Yeah.

280
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,350
I wish it was...

281
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:10,670
Better.

282
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,630
I wish they gave us like a little...

283
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,010
The banner thing for it.

284
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,150
Um...

285
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,590
I wish they gave us a banner thing.

286
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,290
Or just some...

287
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,530
Or made it animated.

288
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,310
Or something.

289
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,770
But other than that...

290
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,330
I like that I'm on the leaderboard.

291
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,950
So like...

292
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,430
I was like...

293
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,530
I was there, guys.

294
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,970
I was there.

295
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,590
Okay.

296
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,730
Everybody knows that.

297
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,170
At least I made it to...

298
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,150
Like, it's...

299
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:31,710
It's just...

300
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,430
Like...

301
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,470
Alright, that's fine.

302
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,030
It's fine.

303
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:34,690
It's fine.

304
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,190
It's...

305
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,330
It's fine.

306
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,790
I'm okay with that.

307
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:39,190
I...

308
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:44,470
I spent two weeks living on Marble Rivals rank for this.

309
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,250
Like, I'm...

310
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:45,770
It's alright.

311
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,870
I'm okay with that.

312
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,090
I'm okay.

313
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,030
How does it look, though?

314
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,870
What is it like?

315
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,550
Where do I see it?

316
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:54,770
Um...

317
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,850
How do I...

318
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,170
Oh, yeah.

319
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:56,730
See the...

320
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:56,990
Wait.

321
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,150
There's no globe.

322
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,350
Wait up.

323
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:01,970
Wait.

324
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,910
Where's my name?

325
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,290
Wait.

326
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,850
Wait a minute.

327
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,560
What do you mean?

328
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,540
Why can't I...

329
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,190
Why can't I look at previous...

330
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,680
Previous seasons?

331
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,520
Wait.

332
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,960
You mean my...

333
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,760
You mean my name already got wiped out?

334
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,650
You trying to tell me that...

335
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,850
It's as if I never existed.

336
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,590
Yeah, but...

337
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,980
I thought...

338
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,470
I thought...

339
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:03,330
I thought you could look at previous seasons later, but...

340
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,750
Did season zero ever truly...

341
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,670
I probably got Thanos this game.

342
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,190
I got Thanos stacked away.

343
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,980
It's okay, guys.

344
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,920
It's okay.

345
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,040
It's okay, guys.

346
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,200
Wait, where do I customize?

347
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,800
Guys, no.

348
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,760
It's okay.

349
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,800
But look at this fancy...

350
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,720
Guys, but look.

351
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,240
Guys.

352
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,220
No, but like...

353
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,200
Guys, okay.

354
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,380
Guys, come on.

355
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:47,960
It's not...

356
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,300
Okay.

357
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,820
Come on, guys.

358
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,300
It's not that bad.

359
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,480
It's...

360
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,760
Okay, guys.

361
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,240
It's not that bad.

362
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,320
Guys, don't.

363
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,620
Guys, come on.

364
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,360
It's...

365
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,240
Guys, guys, guys.

366
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:04,880
Come on, guys.

367
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,380
It's not that bad.

368
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,300
Guys, it's...

369
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,380
Give me a sec.

370
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,260
It's not that bad, everybody.

371
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,200
Come on.

372
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,520
It's not that bad.

373
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,280
Let me fix this real quick.

374
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,160
It's...

375
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,720
Whoa!

376
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,640
Now, everybody will know.

377
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,360
Oh, my.

378
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,060
I told you, guys.

379
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,600
I told...

380
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,240
It's not...

381
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,880
Look at that.

382
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,000
Now, everyone will know that I'm top 500.

383
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,760
Oh, my God.

384
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,960
It's cold outside, guys.

385
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,220
Leave her alone.

386
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:48,780
W.

387
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,380
Mercy.

388
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,300
Thank you for the super chat.

389
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,820
Thank you.

390
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,680
Thank you.

391
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,180
Arcturus, thank you for the super chat.

392
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,900
Thank you, thank you.

393
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,720
It's not too late.

394
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,160
You can still escape the rival's black hole.

395
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,540
Thank you for the super chat.

396
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,020
Thank you.

397
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,020
Look, guys.

398
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:05,660
See?

399
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,960
I told you.

400
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:07,740
Oh, my.

401
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,380
It was so worth it.

402
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,520
It was...

403
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,120
It was so worth it.

404
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,020
Where the...

405
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,780
Where the fuck...

406
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,540
There's no way.

407
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,160
There's no way.

408
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,680
You mean they won't...

409
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,880
What...

410
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,100
What do you mean?

411
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,500
What do you mean?

412
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,880
Where's the...

413
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,060
Wait.

414
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,260
Where's the...

415
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,720
Where's the history?

416
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,440
What do you...

417
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,180
Where's the...

418
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,440
Where's the history?

419
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,320
Where is it?

420
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,500
How would...

421
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,800
But, like...

422
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,840
I feel like you should be allowed to see the history.

423
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,600
I...

424
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,200
Okay.

425
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:52,640
I feel like you should be allowed to see a previous top 500 season.

426
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,980
Dude, relax.

427
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,740
You got the badge.

428
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,060
It's okay.

429
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,380
Maybe they'll add it later.

430
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,140
Okay?

431
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:02,720
Maybe.

432
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,440
Good news.

433
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:03,940
You reached...

434
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,420
Oh, nice.

435
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,360
I reached gold 3.

436
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,320
At least gold...

437
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,780
Guys, no.

438
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,300
It's okay.

439
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,120
I...

440
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,160
I believe that...

441
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,920
I believe that...

442
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,400
They will...

443
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,100
They will add the history of previous seasons, guys.

444
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,140
There is...

445
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,580
There's...

446
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,280
There's no...

447
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,800
They have to have added the history.

448
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,760
There's...

449
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,820
There's no way they wouldn't.

450
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,480
Like...

451
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,220
So, like...

452
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,100
It's not like I did all that for nothing.

453
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,320
I believe they're gonna...

454
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,200
There's gonna be, like, you know, the...

455
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,660
My name will be there.

456
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,780
My name will be there.

457
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,020
Gamrage, thank you for the super chat.

458
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,480
Thank you.

459
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,120
Where is it?

460
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,000
Alright, let's check out the new support.

461
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:54,780
Invis...

462
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,220
Oh, wait.

463
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,680
Before...

464
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,060
We should...

465
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,240
We should look at the...

466
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,100
We should look at the character gallery.

467
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,320
It's okay, Toki.

468
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,320
It wasn't your fault.

469
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,020
Wait.

470
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,120
Is it only season 0?

471
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,760
That's not gonna be registered?

472
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,820
Are you...

473
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,680
Do not fucking bait me.

474
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,820
You know I'm, like, easily baitable.

475
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,580
And, like...

476
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,000
You know I'm...

477
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,120
You know I'm weak.

478
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,080
Do not...

479
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,700
No, do not say that.

480
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,800
Do not...

481
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,020
Do not say that.

482
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,100
Do not tell me that season 1 will count.

483
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,160
But season 0 will...

484
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,400
Do not say that.

485
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,120
Don't say that.

486
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,020
You know I will...

487
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,420
You know I can get...

488
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,020
I'm easily...

489
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,640
I'm weak and will...

490
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,480
And can fold very easily.

491
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,460
Okay, I don't trust you guys.

492
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,040
I'm gonna ask a pro player later.

493
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:53,900
I don't...

494
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,220
I don't trust you guys.

495
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,620
Season...

496
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,420
There's no way.

497
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,600
It's the first season.

498
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,200
There's no way.

499
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:00,720
It's...

500
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,480
It exists.

501
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,300
I saw it.

502
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,600
We were all there.

503
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,080
It was not a dream.

504
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,700
Look.

505
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,740
Look at it.

506
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,220
It's real.

507
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,320
Look.

508
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,240
It's real.

509
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,040
Look.

510
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,300
It's right here.

511
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,620
I...

512
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,440
I was...

513
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,580
There's...

514
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,620
There's no way.

515
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,800
There's...

516
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,020
I...

517
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,380
I...

518
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,940
I was there though.

519
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,400
I...

520
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,500
I was there.

521
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,760
Alright.

522
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,280
Alright.

523
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,520
Invisible woman.

524
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,360
She is 4 stars.

525
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,020
Alright.

526
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,000
4 stars.

527
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:34,340
Okay.

528
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,320
And everybody is like super fucking obsessed over this.

529
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,240
I mean...

530
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,660
Of course.

531
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,700
Also, my favorite part is like people are like...

532
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,800
What the fuck?

533
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,020
Why are they like making skins like this?

534
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,660
But people don't remember that comic book characters back then...

535
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,540
Costumes were like...

536
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,740
Especially for the female heroes...

537
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,760
Were incredibly revealing.

538
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,460
This is them trying to cover it up.

539
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,240
Like the costume that this is based off of...

540
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,560
The original costume that this is based off of...

541
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,920
Was so much worse.

542
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,660
This is...

543
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,660
This was...

544
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,060
This is...

545
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,020
This actually...

546
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,660
They actually put more clothes on her.

547
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,440
Versus the original concept.

548
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,680
This is actually a more modest version.

549
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,120
And cooler too.

550
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,900
Honestly, the design is a lot cooler as well.

551
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,100
Like this is a lot cooler.

552
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,840
But yeah.

553
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,240
When they were talking about this...

554
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,760
The issue where this costume came from...

555
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:37,960
Like...

556
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,300
This part was not covered.

557
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,120
This part was definitely not covered.

558
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,680
Geese, thank you for the super chat.

559
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,500
Thank you, thank you.

560
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,640
Season 0, what are you talking about?

561
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,440
The season just started, Doki.

562
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,940
The game just came out, Doki.

563
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,080
What are you talking about?

564
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,600
Thank you for the super chat, Geese.

565
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,760
Thank you, thank you.

566
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,420
Alright.

567
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,680
Oh yeah, and then the...

568
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,320
The emote for just the inner turmoil.

569
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,500
Oh my god.

570
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,300
The only issue I have about...

571
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,900
Miss Fantastic...

572
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,000
Or like, Invisible Woman...

573
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,380
Is the fact that like...

574
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,260
Is that...

575
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:16,980
She's not...

576
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,460
She doesn't look very special.

577
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,980
Because like...

578
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,320
Her design feels very...

579
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,060
Her default design feels very like...

580
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,580
How do I say it?

581
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,960
Very default.

582
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,600
And it feels very generic.

583
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,400
Yeah, yeah.

584
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,260
Very bland.

585
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,500
Like...

586
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,740
That's why I'm not like a huge fan of it.

587
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,860
Because like...

588
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,620
The only...

589
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,720
It's just...

590
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,520
I know it looks just like her.

591
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,120
It looks just like her.

592
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,940
But her design has never been like super special.

593
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,920
Which like...

594
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,280
I don't know.

595
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:55,860
That's how I feel.

596
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,780
I feel like her design has never been like...

597
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,940
Super like unique in general.

598
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,940
But it's just been...

599
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,440
Okay.

600
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,000
But like...

601
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,800
What the fuck?

602
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,080
Okay.

603
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,240
Oh my...

604
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,540
Okay.

605
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,300
Whoa.

606
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:08,900
Alright.

607
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,320
Sorry.

608
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,920
Launch a force field that can pierce heroes.

609
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,620
Whoa.

610
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,260
Okay.

611
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,080
Flying to maximum...

612
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,360
Alright.

613
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,080
Flying to maximum distance before...

614
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,980
I hope her back is okay.

615
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,920
That's all...

616
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,960
Like...

617
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,640
Oh my god.

618
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,020
My back cracked when I did that.

619
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,600
My...

620
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,520
My...

621
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,720
I was like...

622
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,140
My...

623
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,660
My fucking back...

624
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,360
I hope her back is okay.

625
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,540
That's not comfortable.

626
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,560
That's...

627
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,180
That's...

628
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,640
That's not...

629
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,060
That's...

630
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,920
That's not...

631
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,780
It's not even straight at that point.

632
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,360
The back's not even straight at that point.

633
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,800
Alright.

634
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,440
Flying to maximum distance before returning.

635
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,060
Launches a force field that can pierce heroes.

636
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:04,940
Damaging...

637
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,180
Oh.

638
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:05,620
Oh.

639
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,260
Her healing is just...

640
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,660
Her healing is...

641
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:08,860
Wait.

642
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,740
It's not...

643
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,680
Automatic, right?

644
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,840
Her healing is just Luna.

645
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,120
It's just...

646
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,060
You just gotta aim.

647
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,280
Is it hitscan?

648
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,700
This looks like hitscan.

649
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,340
Okay.

650
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,300
Invisible boundary.

651
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,680
Try to read the text challenge.

652
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,720
Impossible.

653
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,660
Thank you for the super chat, Mike.

654
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,100
Thank you.

655
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,700
Thank you.

656
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,300
Okay.

657
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,260
It's basically like...

658
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:26,740
Oh, okay.

659
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,620
She's just like Luna.

660
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,040
Okay.

661
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,220
She might be fun to play then.

662
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,960
I don't know if she'll be...

663
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,360
Is it Luna?

664
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,160
Is it like...

665
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,220
Is it hitscan or projectile?

666
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,140
Is it projectile?

667
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,020
God fucking...

668
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,260
Okay.

669
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,220
Before returning...

670
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,520
Okay.

671
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:38,660
Alright.

672
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,540
That's a little...

673
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,740
Wait, but what's the point of it returning back?

674
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,520
I don't understand like...

675
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,160
The return...

676
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,360
Oh, does it like ricochet?

677
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,260
So anyone that's in between...

678
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:51,860
Any...

679
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,860
Oh, it's a boomerang.

680
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,620
So anyone in between it...

681
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,620
Will get...

682
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,580
Oh!

683
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,840
It hits multiple...

684
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,820
Oh, I see.

685
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,280
Okay.

686
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,300
Invisible boundary.

687
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,440
Manifests an unseen force field within a chosen area.

688
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,880
Rendering allies inside undetectable by enemies and providing...

689
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:08,700
Oh!

690
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,220
Wait.

691
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,220
I could put...

692
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,020
Use this on point.

693
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:13,680
Oh!

694
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,900
Oh, that's...

695
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,300
Oh.

696
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,180
Wait.

697
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,060
That's so...

698
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,700
That's gonna be so broken if I just...

699
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,920
Put this on the cart.

700
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,580
Especially overtime.

701
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,620
If I use this for overtime...

702
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,860
Oh my god, that's gonna kill everybody.

703
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,180
Yeah.

704
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,460
Yeah.

705
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,160
And then also Star Lord.

706
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,320
I can counter Star Lord.

707
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:37,820
Yeah.

708
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,120
Invisible...

709
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,620
Yeah, I can like basically like...

710
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,820
Put it on the cart and then like...

711
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,780
Or put it on the point.

712
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:45,900
And...

713
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,400
It's...

714
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
This seems like really good for like...

715
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,540
The point and the cart.

716
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,740
If they shoot, it reveals themselves.

717
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,520
Oh, so like if they start...

718
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,340
Oh, so like if the Star Lord be like...

719
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,720
Legendary!

720
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,580
I'll just be like...

721
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:57,940
Don't...

722
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,620
Stop shooting!

723
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,940
Everybody!

724
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,240
Stop shooting!

725
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,820
So...

726
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,340
I just have to yell everybody to be like...

727
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,920
Everyone stop shooting!

728
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,020
When I put it down.

729
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,240
Alright.

730
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,420
Sonic...

731
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,920
Sonic...

732
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Vortex.

733
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:16,920
Pause!

734
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,740
Pause!

735
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,480
Stop fighting!

736
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,040
Okay.

737
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:31,660
So...

738
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,280
Oh, so this is like a mini Groot?

739
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,640
Oh, okay.

740
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,680
So this is like a mini Groot ult.

741
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,180
Basically.

742
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,540
So like a mini...

743
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,860
So it's like a Zarya ult.

744
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,440
But like basically a mini Groot ult.

745
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,180
Oh, she...

746
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,160
Manipulate Sonic...

747
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,920
Oh, her abilities are crazy.

748
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,540
Oh, okay.

749
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,760
So like if I get dived...

750
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,100
Oh, what the fuck?

751
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,600
She counters dive!

752
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,490
No, she has pretty low peel.

753
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,990
No, I can just press E.

754
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,290
I just need to make sure that...

755
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,670
Yeah, I can self-peel.

756
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,910
I can basically boot...

757
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,410
Oh, and I can knock people off.

758
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,910
Oh my gosh, she's like Lucio.

759
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,510
Why would I pull pe...

760
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:22,070
Oh, I guess I could pull an enemy in front of me if I...

761
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,310
I pull a support in front of me to kill him.

762
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,210
Release a three-hit combo.

763
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,970
The third attack will launch up enemies.

764
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,290
Oh, what?

765
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,410
I have my own melee attack?

766
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,950
My God!

767
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,750
What else does she need?

768
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:41,810
What the...

769
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,270
Oh my God, what else?

770
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,790
I have more?

771
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,510
Stepping on it propels you...

772
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,310
What the fuck?

773
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,590
Okay.

774
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,910
How much peel do I have?

775
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:59,230
I'm just gonna leave my other support partner to die at that point.

776
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,890
Like, I'll be like...

777
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,070
Sayonara, I'm fucking gone.

778
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:04,150
I'm...

779
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,970
My other support's gonna get dived and I'll be like...

780
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:11,370
Bye.

781
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,030
Okay.

782
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:16,990
I...

783
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,430
I have a right click?

784
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:18,850
Okay.

785
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,930
Generate a force shield in front of an ally.

786
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:26,950
The shield can block damage and provide healing over time.

787
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,070
Enemies that pass through the shield...

788
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:33,150
Enter invisible state sometime after and grant yourself healing.

789
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,930
I can heal myself?!

790
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,250
Alright, what is the Mr. Fantastic?

791
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,170
To fortify the entire...

792
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,950
This bolster granting damage resistance.

793
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,650
What the fuck?

794
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,110
Okay.

795
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:46,950
That's...

796
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,370
That's crazy.

797
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:49,990
Okay.

798
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:50,910
What is...

799
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,910
Okay, that is the...

800
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:56,150
Okay, so these are some cooler stuff that I can do.

801
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,570
Oh my God!

802
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,150
The right shift can be spammed?

803
00:31:59,210 --> 00:31:59,730
Wait a minute.

804
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,450
Wait, right shift can be spammed?

805
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,310
Wait.

806
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,930
What was the right...

807
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,930
Oh, I can spam this?

808
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,270
How much do I have from this?

809
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,330
There's no cooldowns!

810
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,710
Wait, what?

811
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:15,650
Wait!

812
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,790
There's no cooldowns!

813
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,090
Oh, it has a cooldown once it broke.

814
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:23,850
Oh, thank God.

815
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,430
I was gonna freak out if this doesn't have a...

816
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,530
If it doesn't have a cool...

817
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,350
I would literally freak out if that didn't...

818
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:29,570
Alright.

819
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:30,910
Okay, but like...

820
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,370
Other than invisible women...

821
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,910
Okay, Mr. Fantastic though...

822
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:37,730
Um...

823
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,230
I'm sorry.

824
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,190
He's so...

825
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,830
He's so fucking goofy.

826
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:43,910
Because like...

827
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:44,910
Um...

828
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:45,650
What was it?

829
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,790
When he...

830
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,520
He's so...

831
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,360
He's literally loopy.

832
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,760
Yeah, like...

833
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,540
He's so...

834
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,420
He's...

835
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,560
Oh, my God.

836
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,020
Like...

837
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,200
Look at him.

838
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
Oh, my God.

839
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:03,920
Fantastic!

840
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,580
He looks so funny.

841
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,500
Okay.

842
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,340
Um...

843
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,040
Why play Iron Fist when you could...

844
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,420
Honestly, like...

845
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:12,960
You know what?

846
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,720
Your friend who's an Iron Fist main...

847
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,700
He's gonna become a Mr. Fantastic main.

848
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,700
Like, look at this.

849
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,520
It's such a terrible...

850
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,500
Oh, my God.

851
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,380
He's so wild.

852
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,900
Look at him.

853
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,000
Oh, my...

854
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,300
He's...

855
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,900
He's built like a fucking tank.

856
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,240
But he's DPS.

857
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,720
What's this?

858
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,980
Gain a shield.

859
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,940
Select a target.

860
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,620
Dealing damage to enemies.

861
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,280
Oh, no.

862
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,800
He's definitely the new Iron Fist.

863
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:38,680
He...

864
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,160
He's...

865
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,280
He's 100% the new Iron...

866
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,580
What the fuck?

867
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,340
That is loopy.

868
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,440
Wait.

869
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,540
That is loopy.

870
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,880
What the fuck?

871
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,360
Reaching full elasticity.

872
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,020
Triggers an inflated state.

873
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,660
That grand shield...

874
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,600
Oh, shit.

875
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,880
What a man.

876
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:01,920
Okay.

877
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,960
That's...

878
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,200
He's like...

879
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,940
The guy she tells you not to worry about.

880
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,260
What's...

881
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:11,400
Okay.

882
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,120
So, that's her...

883
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,800
His...

884
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,680
That's his, like, basically team up.

885
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,520
What's the newest team up?

886
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,360
Does anyone know the...

887
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,180
What are the newest team ups this season?

888
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,400
This is still there.

889
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:23,740
Wait.

890
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,100
It's the same team ups.

891
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,520
They didn't add anything new.

892
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,420
I thought they said...

893
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,400
I thought they were renew...

894
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,260
Oh, wait.

895
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,080
Is this new?

896
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:34,940
Baltic Union?

897
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,580
No.

898
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:35,920
No.

899
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,460
They're all the same.

900
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:37,860
Oh.

901
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,700
No changes.

902
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,580
Oh, it's on season two.

903
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,060
Oh, they're planning on...

904
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,760
Oh, they're changing in season two.

905
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,160
Okay.

906
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:45,980
Okay.

907
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,540
I thought...

908
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,380
I thought they were changing it for this season.

909
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,020
But they're changing it for season two.

910
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,360
Okay.

911
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,040
Alright, let's get to know.

912
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,820
Let's get to know.

913
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,300
I will not buy you.

914
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,800
You cannot tempt me.

915
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,460
Also, cause, like...

916
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,840
Also, like...

917
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,520
None of these are characters I actually play.

918
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,760
So, I don't really care that much.

919
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,220
Like...

920
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,620
None of them are, like, characters I care about.

921
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,400
So, I don't really care too much about the...

922
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,420
Also, I found out...

923
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,540
That the team...

924
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,360
The professional team...

925
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,820
That was queue sniping me.

926
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,060
And, like...

927
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,840
That was, like...

928
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,900
That won the tournament.

929
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,220
Their team name...

930
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,500
Was called Mutants.

931
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,440
I deserve it.

932
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,680
Like...

933
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,260
I fucking...

934
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,300
I deserve that.

935
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,660
I...

936
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,460
Their team name was Mutants.

937
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,380
Things make more sense.

938
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,360
Actually, everything makes sense now.

939
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,020
Poor Mutant.

940
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:57,600
God.

941
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,900
Mutant and proud.

942
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,260
Alright.

943
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,600
I actually want to try out...

944
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,380
Miss Fen...

945
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,240
Uh...

946
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:04,320
Uh...

947
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,180
Invisible woman's...

948
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,000
Uh...

949
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,180
Abilities real quick.

950
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,400
How is the grind?

951
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,720
Surely, we're not off-stream.

952
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,340
Oh, wait.

953
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,060
Is this...

954
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,520
Oh...

955
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,720
They don't know.

956
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,780
I'm not gonna...

957
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,680
I'm not gonna look at what they said.

958
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,440
Alright.

959
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,660
Oh, my God.

960
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,020
Jesus.

961
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
My back cracked trying to do this pose.

962
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,040
Alright.

963
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:24,840
So...

964
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,800
What the fu...

965
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,620
Oh, my God.

966
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,500
I can...

967
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:27,980
What?

968
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,840
I can be, like...

969
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,060
I can basically...

970
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,420
Give it to different people.

971
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:33,660
Okay.

972
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,620
And then...

973
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,080
Okay.

974
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:36,780
What's the cooldown?

975
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,180
It's five seconds?

976
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:39,760
Okay.

977
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,660
That...

978
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,400
I feel like that should be longer.

979
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:42,820
But, like...

980
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,300
That's okay.

981
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:43,920
That's okay.

982
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,720
That means...

983
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,940
That means I get to play her more.

984
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,500
Oh, my God.

985
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,380
It's five seconds for cooldown when the shield is gone.

986
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,120
And then, this is me being invisible.

987
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,380
And then...

988
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,140
Okay.

989
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,740
If I pierce it, does that mean...

990
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,420
Oh!

991
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,640
What?

992
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,480
Okay.

993
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,620
Okay.

994
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,280
Okay.

995
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:04,840
Alright.

996
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,400
If they all stand in a line...

997
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,260
Oh, my God.

998
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,020
Okay.

999
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,460
How far does it go?

1000
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,020
How far does this go, though?

1001
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:13,900
Oh, my God.

1002
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,220
Oh, that's...

1003
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:15,640
Wow.

1004
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,520
That...

1005
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,420
It's basically Moon Knight.

1006
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,480
How far does the...

1007
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,320
This is the distance.

1008
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,120
Oh, my...

1009
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:22,780
Okay.

1010
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,560
Okay.

1011
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,000
The distance is far.

1012
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,720
So, it's like my clap, but like forever.

1013
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,100
Wait, that's actually crazy.

1014
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,220
This is like my...

1015
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,360
This is better than Luna.

1016
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,880
This is actually better than Luna!

1017
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,320
Like...

1018
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,220
Other...

1019
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:39,980
Like...

1020
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,300
Okay.

1021
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,380
Invisible woman with Luna would go so hard...

1022
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,880
With Mantis would go so hard.

1023
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,520
Or like her with Luna would go so fucking hard.

1024
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:50,960
Or like...

1025
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,500
Oh, my God.

1026
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:56,160
Triple support with invisible woman, Luna, and Mantis.

1027
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,320
Nothing will die.

1028
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,040
Nothing will fucking die.

1029
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,020
The only issue is that it's projectile.

1030
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,380
I have to learn how to aim with that.

1031
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,580
Yeah, that's the only issue.

1032
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:08,840
Okay.

1033
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,960
So, that's the maximum distance here.

1034
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,120
Okay.

1035
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:12,760
Alright.

1036
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,580
So, that's the maximum distance.

1037
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,140
The only issue is that...

1038
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,880
If they're too far, I can't heal them.

1039
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,640
I basically can't heal them if they're too far.

1040
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,760
So, like, if they're that far...

1041
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,020
I can't do anything.

1042
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,280
So...

1043
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,820
You need somebody close for...

1044
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,040
Yeah.

1045
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,140
That's still...

1046
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,080
That's actually...

1047
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,120
She's mid-range healer.

1048
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,680
But that's so scary.

1049
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,700
If they're all like grouped...

1050
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,980
Because, like, you know when you're holding corners and stuff?

1051
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,060
When you have to hold a corner...

1052
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,560
And then you do that...

1053
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,800
That's so scary.

1054
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,440
Like...

1055
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,660
An invisible woman just heals like this.

1056
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,980
All she does is just do that.

1057
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:51,700
And then...

1058
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,420
That's so scary.

1059
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:54,920
Like the...

1060
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,760
The Wakanda map...

1061
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,360
Where we all...

1062
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,700
Where the support...

1063
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,820
They'll all hold the top right...

1064
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,820
The top corner high ground thing.

1065
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,240
In the Wakanda map.

1066
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,620
With the panther.

1067
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,800
I literally could just do that and you're dead.

1068
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,580
Like...

1069
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,460
What's the distance?

1070
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,280
The distance?

1071
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,300
I can be here.

1072
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,100
That's the distance.

1073
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,740
That's how far I can be.

1074
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,660
That's how far I can be.

1075
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,420
Let's see.

1076
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,240
And then...

1077
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,400
This one was...

1078
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:29,860
Basically...

1079
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,660
Okay, that's eight.

1080
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:30,920
Okay.

1081
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,920
This one is the shift.

1082
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,960
This one was the pull, right?

1083
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,480
I can pull him.

1084
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,380
Okay, I can do that.

1085
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,160
And I can launch.

1086
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:44,500
Okay.

1087
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,260
Yeah, this is the pull.

1088
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,660
Okay, the little grab.

1089
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,240
Okay, so that's the grab.

1090
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,300
And then Q was like...

1091
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,160
Don't shoot!

1092
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:57,660
Alright.

1093
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,980
Yeah, I can heal and DPS at the same time.

1094
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,060
Which is basically like the Luna clap.

1095
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,140
Oh my god.

1096
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,400
That's crazy.

1097
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,380
Okay, I need to like...

1098
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,820
I think she'll be meta.

1099
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,620
I legitimately think she's gonna be meta.

1100
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,960
So I have to learn her.

1101
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,120
Alright, let's check out Mr. Fantastic too.

1102
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,860
I do think she's gonna be meta.

1103
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,700
Big boy!

1104
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,340
Hello, lady.

1105
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,940
Hello, ladies.

1106
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,400
Elf ship.

1107
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,640
Yeah, elf ship and walk.

1108
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,800
Hello, ladies.

1109
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,240
I'm married.

1110
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,780
Tap walk.

1111
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,140
Oh my god.

1112
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,600
Oh, this is basically like new Iron Fist players.

1113
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,020
Because I feel like...

1114
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,380
Oh my god.

1115
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,060
How far?

1116
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,080
How far?

1117
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,680
You see that?

1118
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,620
You see that support player over there?

1119
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,380
He's gone.

1120
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,760
I'm gonna be the...

1121
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,180
I'm gonna be the mantis Luna.

1122
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,880
I'm gonna be the Luna right there.

1123
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,880
And I see Mr. Fantastic just walk by.

1124
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,820
And I'll be like...

1125
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,540
He's so far.

1126
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,940
What's he gonna fucking do?

1127
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,300
And Mr. Fantastic is just gonna be like...

1128
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,480
He's just gonna be like...

1129
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,740
Boom.

1130
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,480
Boom.

1131
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:26,700
Boom.

1132
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:27,820
Boom.

1133
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,000
Boom.

1134
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,160
And I'll be like...

1135
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,440
Please leave me alone.

1136
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,360
Alright.

1137
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,240
That's crazy.

1138
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,400
Can I...

1139
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,700
Oh my god.

1140
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,480
I hit things if I just do that.

1141
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,340
I don't even need to aim.

1142
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,480
I don't even need to aim.

1143
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,200
I can just be like...

1144
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,210
Oh my god.

1145
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,370
His punches are whip.

1146
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:00,950
Boom.

1147
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:02,670
Boom.

1148
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,650
I can whip him like...

1149
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:05,350
Like that.

1150
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:05,590
Wait.

1151
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,250
That's...

1152
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,830
That's so scary.

1153
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:08,970
That's actually...

1154
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,450
That's so scary.

1155
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,210
As a support player, I am scared.

1156
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,650
I am so scared.

1157
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:18,350
Alright.

1158
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:19,070
Let's try...

1159
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,690
Let's try Mr. Fantastic.

1160
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,230
Let's try Invisible Woman real quick.

1161
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:25,550
Alright.

1162
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,090
Yeah.

1163
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,630
They can hit a whole team.

1164
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:30,850
So I'm...

1165
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:31,790
I have fear.

1166
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,050
I feel fear.

1167
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,290
I feel...

1168
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,210
I feel fear right now.

1169
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,830
Don't worry.

1170
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,170
They'll see my...

1171
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:46,870
They're gonna see my...

1172
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,490
That's like...

1173
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:49,510
That's like...

1174
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,650
I see blonde woman.

1175
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,280
I see...

1176
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,460
I see blonde...

1177
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,840
That's what I mean.

1178
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,600
She just looks like...

1179
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,760
She just looks like Logan Dagger.

1180
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,780
So I got confused.

1181
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,300
I picked...

1182
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,830
I picked a dagger.

1183
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,890
I'm wrong.

1184
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,350
Blonde woman.

1185
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,370
Blonde...

1186
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:25,170
Faithless is just so generic.

1187
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,350
Oh my god.

1188
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,950
I can't...

1189
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,530
I can't take this anymore.

1190
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,610
They both look so generic.

1191
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:40,570
I can't.

1192
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:41,550
I can't.

1193
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:43,510
Oh my god.

1194
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,430
I'm so blonde.

1195
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:48,550
They're both blonde.

1196
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,490
So I got confused.

1197
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,010
I got confused.

1198
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:54,550
Alright.

1199
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:55,690
It's Luffy time.

1200
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,690
I already forgot like all his abilities.

1201
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,850
So I'm just gonna start punching.

1202
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:01,710
Okay.

1203
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:02,750
Shift is to reflect.

1204
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:03,630
And then...

1205
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:04,650
Oh, E is to grab.

1206
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:05,250
I'm gonna...

1207
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,650
I love the icon for it.

1208
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:08,370
It's literally...

1209
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:08,770
Okay, wait.

1210
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,190
I'm gonna grab somebody right here.

1211
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:11,250
I'm gonna do it.

1212
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,250
Watch this.

1213
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,190
Oh my god!

1214
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,350
Holy shit.

1215
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,850
I wasn't expecting him to fucking grab me though.

1216
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,350
Oh my god.

1217
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:27,220
Oh my god.

1218
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:30,710
Jesus Christ.

1219
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:31,750
I'm a big boy now.

1220
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:32,970
I'm fucking big.

1221
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,250
That's right.

1222
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:35,850
Oh my god.

1223
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:36,930
I'm fucking dead.

1224
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:42,130
Holy shit.

1225
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:42,690
Holy shit.

1226
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:42,710
Sorry.

1227
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,090
I'm dead now.

1228
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:44,890
I'm dead.

1229
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:45,210
Look.

1230
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:45,590
I...

1231
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,770
I can't.

1232
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,290
I see those two women and I'm like, who's who?

1233
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:52,090
Alright.

1234
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:53,130
Let's see.

1235
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:53,690
How do I...

1236
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,390
Is there a way to walk faster?

1237
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:55,770
No.

1238
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:56,070
Okay.

1239
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:56,950
Alright.

1240
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:58,970
I can also...

1241
00:44:58,970 --> 00:44:59,330
Oh, you're...

1242
00:44:59,330 --> 00:44:59,550
I...

1243
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:00,330
Yeah, I know.

1244
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:01,470
I can also see.

1245
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:03,710
I just start...

1246
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:04,990
And then I just start punching.

1247
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:06,790
And then...

1248
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,470
And then I start...

1249
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:09,610
Why did I grab him?

1250
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:11,270
Oh my god.

1251
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:13,570
What?

1252
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:14,290
How do you...

1253
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,590
Okay, that's fine.

1254
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:17,490
I have my wife.

1255
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,150
My wife.

1256
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,510
That's right.

1257
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:24,050
My wife was here to save me.

1258
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:25,890
That's fucking right.

1259
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:28,850
I don't know what's going on.

1260
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:29,830
I just start punching.

1261
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:31,190
And I just...

1262
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:32,450
I just start punching.

1263
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:33,870
Am I reflecting?

1264
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:34,910
Do I reflect any...

1265
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:35,490
Look at me.

1266
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:39,730
Look at me.

1267
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:40,030
That's right.

1268
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,230
I'm just gonna...

1269
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:44,390
That's fucking right.

1270
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,070
You're not my wife.

1271
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:50,490
You imposter.

1272
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:51,750
There you go.

1273
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:52,930
We're okay.

1274
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,010
See, it's that.

1275
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:55,810
I just...

1276
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:56,590
I just ulted.

1277
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:57,930
I just ulted her.

1278
00:45:58,570 --> 00:45:59,550
That's fucking right.

1279
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:00,170
Get over here.

1280
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,190
Get over.

1281
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:02,290
Oh yeah.

1282
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,530
Oh, I reflect nothing.

1283
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,150
But that's fine.

1284
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:08,430
I'm just gonna start punching.

1285
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:13,050
So I just started blasting.

1286
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,170
Where am I?

1287
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:17,870
Get over here.

1288
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,970
What's going on?

1289
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,010
Oh shit.

1290
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:25,730
Oh shit.

1291
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:26,490
Oh shit.

1292
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:27,750
I'm just gonna walk over.

1293
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:31,470
There we go.

1294
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:32,710
There we go.

1295
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:37,250
Okay, I need to stop going in with that.

1296
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:38,810
And I just start punching.

1297
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,450
I'm just...

1298
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:40,410
I'm gonna start punching.

1299
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:41,530
I don't care.

1300
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,150
Get over here, Hulk.

1301
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:44,290
I'm the new tank.

1302
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,410
I'm the new tank now.

1303
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,290
Get over here.

1304
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:48,790
You think just cause you're big...

1305
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:50,850
You think...

1306
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:51,850
That's right.

1307
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,870
Get over here.

1308
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:56,670
Shield time.

1309
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:58,310
I'm still gonna start punching.

1310
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,270
That's right.

1311
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:01,850
Get over here, Wolverine.

1312
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:05,710
Oh, you're gonna jump away from me?

1313
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,090
That's right.

1314
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:07,850
You don't...

1315
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:10,470
Where am I?

1316
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,390
Alright, that's easy.

1317
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,070
I don't know what happened.

1318
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:19,010
I don't know what happened.

1319
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:20,230
Okay.

1320
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:21,990
I'm done.

1321
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:24,570
Fantastic.

1322
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:26,410
Let's go.

1323
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:28,430
So easy.

1324
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:30,650
She's so strong.

1325
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:31,550
That's right.

1326
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:34,030
My hands are gonna fucking touch you.

1327
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,110
Yeah.

1328
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:38,530
I need to stop doing that.

1329
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:43,810
I need to stop just standing there.

1330
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:44,930
And...

1331
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:46,210
I can't help it.

1332
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,210
Like, I just wanna walk around like that all the time.

1333
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:49,970
Oh, no.

1334
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:50,530
Wife.

1335
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:51,110
Wife.

1336
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:51,870
Heal me.

1337
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,570
I love you, wife.

1338
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:54,670
Okay.

1339
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:55,370
That's fine.

1340
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:56,290
What's that gonna do?

1341
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:57,070
I got heals.

1342
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,150
I got...

1343
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:58,850
Oh, shit.

1344
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:00,450
That's right.

1345
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,290
It's so tough.

1346
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:07,470
Oh, no.

1347
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:08,110
Oh, no.

1348
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,090
He got buffed, too.

1349
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:09,830
Wait.

1350
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:10,710
Wait.

1351
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:12,250
He got...

1352
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,910
He got buffed, too.

1353
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:14,850
I just...

1354
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:16,990
That should be illegal.

1355
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:17,970
Alright.

1356
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:21,350
That's the heal me walk.

1357
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:23,790
Like, it does nothing.

1358
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:24,890
It's just me...

1359
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:27,430
It's just me establishing dominance.

1360
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,170
Like, it's actually detrimental for me to do that.

1361
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:32,730
I couldn't help it.

1362
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:33,730
I just need them to know.

1363
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:35,950
It's literally my, like...

1364
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,710
It's literally my, like, alpha walk right there.

1365
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:39,650
Alright.

1366
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:41,310
Don't worry.

1367
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:42,990
It's okay.

1368
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:44,110
It's time!

1369
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:46,690
FANTASTIC!

1370
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,510
Get over here, fake wife!

1371
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:49,950
I've missed.

1372
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:53,110
Oh, but you think that's fucking right.

1373
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:53,830
Get over here.

1374
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:54,630
Oh, my god.

1375
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:55,170
Oh, no.

1376
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:56,530
Oh, no.

1377
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:58,510
It's so goofy.

1378
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,610
It's fantastic.

1379
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:02,150
It's okay.

1380
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:03,290
I did my job.

1381
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,310
I actually did my job.

1382
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:10,930
I have no goddamn idea what's happening.

1383
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:13,290
I just started punching.

1384
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:14,450
That's really it.

1385
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:15,670
And then I just...

1386
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:16,590
I just started punching.

1387
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:20,130
That is the waddle to escape.

1388
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:23,470
I can't...

1389
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:24,650
I can't help it.

1390
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:25,190
I just...

1391
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:27,650
I just want to establish dominance, you know?

1392
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:30,990
Alright, there you go.

1393
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:31,850
Get over here.

1394
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:32,690
Get...

1395
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:33,110
Oh, no.

1396
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:34,490
He's gonna start smashing.

1397
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:34,970
Oh, yeah!

1398
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:35,990
Ho!

1399
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:38,750
No.

1400
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:40,790
That's fucking right.

1401
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:42,330
Ha-ha!

1402
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:47,950
Not gonna lie, but, like, his, like, voice lines for it is so goofy.

1403
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:49,030
He's like, ha-ha!

1404
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:50,670
Ha-ha!

1405
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:53,190
Alright.

1406
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,210
Get over here.

1407
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,510
Get over here.

1408
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:57,010
Get...

1409
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,410
I'm fucking gonna grab you!

1410
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:59,250
That's right!

1411
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:00,670
Get over here!

1412
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:02,090
You think you can just...

1413
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:02,450
Yeah!

1414
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,480
I'm the new tank!

1415
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,270
I'm the new tank!

1416
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:08,470
Ha-ha-ha!

1417
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:10,950
Get...

1418
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:11,670
Oh, hello!

1419
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:14,610
You know what it's time to do?

1420
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:16,310
Fantastic!

1421
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,330
Okay, that's not fair.

1422
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,410
That's actually not fair.

1423
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:21,870
Come on.

1424
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:23,350
Come on.

1425
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:23,770
No!

1426
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:26,010
Are you serious?!

1427
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:26,870
He's like...

1428
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:29,550
He's so un-serious.

1429
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:30,570
He is.

1430
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,150
He's so, like...

1431
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:32,710
He's...

1432
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,010
He's so goofy.

1433
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:36,230
He actually is so fucking...

1434
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:36,950
Goofy.

1435
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,090
Ha -ha -ha!

1436
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:44,270
I can't take his voice lines seriously because his voice lines are, like...

1437
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:45,650
Like...

1438
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:46,130
You know, I...

1439
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:47,670
You know, I always thought Mr. Re...

1440
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:48,650
Like, you know...

1441
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,710
Reed Richards was, like, a cool guy.

1442
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:51,090
I...

1443
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:51,550
He's not.

1444
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:52,330
I don't know.

1445
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:53,290
He's...

1446
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:54,930
He's definitely dad-coded.

1447
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:58,750
He's incredibly dad-coded.

1448
00:50:59,110 --> 00:50:59,770
Ha-ha-ha!

1449
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:03,290
He's so...

1450
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,590
He's such a goofy-loofy.

1451
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:05,150
Now...

1452
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:05,490
Yeah.

1453
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:06,890
Alright, there you go.

1454
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,090
I need the Arshia.

1455
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:09,290
Come on.

1456
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:10,010
Get over here.

1457
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:10,710
Oh!

1458
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:11,390
That's...

1459
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,130
Get over here.

1460
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:12,790
That's...

1461
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:13,990
Get over here.

1462
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:15,430
Don't worry.

1463
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:16,530
I still have this.

1464
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:18,710
I'm gonna keep grabbing...

1465
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:20,950
Oh, fuck!

1466
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:21,610
Oh, fuck!

1467
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:22,070
Oh!

1468
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:22,830
Reflect!

1469
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:23,970
That's right!

1470
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:24,510
I'm reflecting!

1471
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,290
Ha -ha-ha-ha!

1472
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:28,790
What's your arrows gonna do to me?

1473
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:30,990
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

1474
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,450
He's such a fucking dad.

1475
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:35,130
Oh, man.

1476
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:36,690
I just...

1477
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:37,610
I just keep shooting.

1478
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:38,710
And I just...

1479
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:40,210
Nice!

1480
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:41,310
Alright.

1481
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:42,370
Oh, yeah!

1482
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:43,490
Oh!

1483
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,750
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

1484
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:46,850
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

1485
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:47,570
Ha -ha-ha-ha!

1486
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,330
What's that gonna do, Groot?

1487
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:50,690
What the fuck?

1488
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:54,050
What the fuck is...

1489
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:57,050
Okay, his ult is jack shit.

1490
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:58,150
I'm gonna...

1491
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:58,450
Alright.

1492
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:00,650
I'm not gonna pretend his ult is good.

1493
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:03,390
I'm actually not gonna pretend that his ult is good.

1494
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,570
His ult seems pretty bad.

1495
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:05,150
Not gonna lie.

1496
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:05,830
His...

1497
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:06,570
Ha-ha-ha!

1498
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:08,150
His ult seems...

1499
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:11,150
His ult...

1500
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:13,050
His ult seems incredible.

1501
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:15,530
I can't...

1502
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,630
We have Ruby.

1503
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:19,840
Oh, I have to like...

1504
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:21,810
Hit multiple targets?

1505
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,470
You mean I can't solo ult?

1506
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:24,070
Oh, I won.

1507
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:25,010
Yay!

1508
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,840
Oh, it stops if I miss?

1509
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:29,690
Oh!

1510
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:31,550
So it's like again!

1511
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:35,030
Oh, it's basically again!

1512
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:35,930
And again!

1513
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:37,210
Oh!

1514
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:39,850
I didn't realize.

1515
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,010
It's like this...

1516
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:43,170
Yeah, I didn't realize it was like again.

1517
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:44,650
You have to keep hitting.

1518
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:44,950
You can.

1519
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:45,890
You just don't miss.

1520
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:46,590
Just don't miss.

1521
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:47,410
It's just that easy.

1522
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,030
Okay, Mr. Fantastic is so fucking goofy.

1523
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:53,090
I didn't know what my highlight was during that.

1524
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:56,570
Was it just me just fucking slapping the Wolverine?

1525
00:52:58,510 --> 00:52:59,550
As it should.

1526
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:01,170
Oh, it's the again!

1527
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:02,970
Oh my god.

1528
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:05,150
And then that's me killing my fake wife.

1529
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:06,650
Ha -ha-ha-ha!

1530
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:10,430
Alright.

1531
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:12,790
The damage buff number was...

1532
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,150
Wait, do I got...

1533
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,570
Ha -ha-ha-ha!

1534
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:17,190
Oh my god, wait!

1535
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:21,970
I have 15k damage blocked as a DPS.

1536
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:24,330
Holy shit!

1537
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:25,930
Bro, that's literally...

1538
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,690
He's literally a DPS tank.

1539
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,370
He has the damage of a...

1540
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:33,410
He has the damage of a DPS but built like a fucking tank.

1541
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:34,270
That's crazy.

1542
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:35,230
That's...

1543
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:36,370
That's actually scary.

1544
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:37,150
That's actually...

1545
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:39,450
That's actually pretty scary.

1546
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:40,310
Not gonna lie.

1547
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:43,170
I am the tank now.

1548
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:47,490
I am the tank.

1549
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:50,090
Alright, now.

1550
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,150
Now, it should be guys.

1551
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:52,410
Now, I should be...

1552
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:52,610
No!

1553
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:54,370
Am I...

1554
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:55,810
Am I backfilling?

1555
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:00,250
What's the point?

1556
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,590
What's the point of backfilling?

1557
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,130
God damn it.

1558
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:05,310
Like...

1559
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:11,030
I can't believe people are willing to take a 15 minute penalty in quick play then fucking playing it out because they can't play.

1560
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:12,110
Like, you're gonna...

1561
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:13,950
You have to take like...

1562
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,590
You still have a penalty.

1563
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:16,950
Like, I don't...

1564
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:21,570
Oh shit.

1565
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:22,890
Let me...

1566
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:24,350
Grab this real quick.

1567
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:25,830
Why is there a Loki behind...

1568
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:28,570
Also like, why is there a Loki behind us?

1569
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:29,110
Wait a minute.

1570
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:29,770
Wait!

1571
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:30,890
What the...

1572
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:31,170
Wait!

1573
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:32,910
Okay, I literally just got here.

1574
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:33,790
I...

1575
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:34,590
I...

1576
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:35,150
Please.

1577
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:35,750
Please.

1578
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:36,510
Oh no.

1579
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,050
Please.

1580
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:37,710
Please.

1581
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:38,950
I just got here.

1582
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,050
Just...

1583
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,350
Yeah, like...

1584
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:47,250
Don't you get a penalty for...

1585
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:50,310
For like, leaving a quick play game?

1586
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:56,490
They'd rather just like, leave a quick play game than fucking...

1587
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:58,750
They'd rather just take the penalty.

1588
00:54:59,030 --> 00:54:59,670
Like, that's crazy.

1589
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:00,430
Here we go.

1590
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:02,470
I...

1591
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:03,270
Okay, moon.

1592
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:04,090
It's alright.

1593
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:04,550
I'm okay.

1594
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:06,190
Alright.

1595
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,430
Yeah, we can do it.

1596
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:08,710
Yeah.

1597
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:09,970
I assume so.

1598
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:10,370
Wait.

1599
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,230
They haven't even fully capped it yet.

1600
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:12,750
It's okay.

1601
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:13,610
We have...

1602
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,770
We have Mr. Fantastic.

1603
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:17,270
Alright.

1604
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:18,290
Where are they?

1605
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:21,370
It's fine.

1606
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:22,870
Let me just...

1607
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:23,810
Be over here.

1608
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:24,670
What are they gonna do?

1609
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:25,430
Kill me?

1610
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:26,990
Wow.

1611
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:28,470
Cool skin.

1612
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:33,590
You're so bad.

1613
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:40,510
Oh my god!

1614
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:41,470
Where did he go?

1615
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:43,610
Wait, he shot.

1616
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:46,670
I know I want to be in here.

1617
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:47,510
I...

1618
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,490
Oh my god, it was like a magic trick.

1619
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,050
It was so scary.

1620
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:53,350
It truly was like a magic trick.

1621
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,950
She said disappeared and he disappeared.

1622
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:56,650
What do I do?

1623
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,190
Okay.

1624
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:00,450
Nope.

1625
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,470
Wait, wait a minute.

1626
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:03,990
Wait a minute.

1627
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:15,990
Welcome to quick play, buddy.

1628
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:19,650
Wait, I can kill this guy too.

1629
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:21,750
Welcome to quick play.

1630
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:24,250
Oh, I can't.

1631
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:25,050
I can't.

1632
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:28,450
Holy...

1633
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:29,590
Play of the game.

1634
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:30,530
Oh my god!

1635
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:31,710
Thank you for the raid!

1636
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:32,990
Thank you, thank you!

1637
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:34,690
Oh, I'll just stay here.

1638
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:35,610
Okay.

1639
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:37,690
Poor Mr. Van.

1640
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:39,030
Oh my god, this is it.

1641
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,090
How would they know where I am?

1642
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:42,110
They know.

1643
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:43,990
I forgot I can't shoot.

1644
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:46,570
You're not supposed to shoot, guys.

1645
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:47,930
Okay, I need to leave.

1646
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:49,330
I need to leave.

1647
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:50,850
What are you doing?

1648
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:53,030
What the fuck are you doing?

1649
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:55,450
Oh, wait.

1650
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:56,270
I don't have heals.

1651
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:57,610
They know what they're doing.

1652
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:01,390
Okay, let me just farm this real fast.

1653
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:03,550
And then...

1654
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:05,510
Wait, I hear people behind me.

1655
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,070
Oh, you wanna go?

1656
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:09,470
Wait, okay, wait.

1657
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:09,930
Never mind.

1658
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:10,770
I don't wanna go.

1659
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:11,370
Please.

1660
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:12,010
Please.

1661
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:13,270
Please, wife.

1662
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:15,730
Alright, you wanna go?

1663
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:18,610
That's fucking right.

1664
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:20,390
Guys.

1665
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:20,950
Guys.

1666
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:21,570
Guys.

1667
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:22,230
Guys!

1668
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:23,870
I literally...

1669
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:24,930
I did so much.

1670
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:28,370
Oh no, he's coming over.

1671
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:29,370
Oh no.

1672
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:30,870
Oh no, they're gone.

1673
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:31,650
Where did they go?

1674
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:32,790
Where did they...

1675
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:33,970
Where did they go?

1676
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:36,190
Do you think they know?

1677
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:37,050
Oh, they know.

1678
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:37,430
They know.

1679
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:38,150
I'm so slowed.

1680
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:39,330
I'm so slowed.

1681
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:43,310
That's right.

1682
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:44,030
Get over here.

1683
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:45,170
Get over here.

1684
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:45,990
Oh!

1685
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:47,370
Oh, fuck.

1686
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:47,710
Okay.

1687
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:48,910
Um...

1688
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:49,870
They won't chase me, right?

1689
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:51,950
That'd be pretty dumb for them to do.

1690
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:53,750
Okay.

1691
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:55,230
Come on.

1692
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:56,950
Oh no.

1693
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:57,590
Oh no.

1694
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:00,630
Oh, goddammit.

1695
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:01,670
They did the lamp.

1696
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,350
The one thing that countered me.

1697
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:05,310
No.

1698
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:06,250
Please.

1699
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:07,050
Please heal me.

1700
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:08,390
Please.

1701
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:09,890
He can't aim.

1702
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:11,190
No!

1703
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:12,690
No, where am I?

1704
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:13,870
Where am I?

1705
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:16,590
Okay, we're fine.

1706
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:17,530
Everything is okay.

1707
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:18,530
I'm just gonna kill her.

1708
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:21,050
It's not fine.

1709
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:24,250
I need heals so badly.

1710
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:26,970
Okay.

1711
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:28,510
Okay, come on.

1712
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:29,130
That's not fair.

1713
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,250
I literally just got here.

1714
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:33,650
Okay, come on.

1715
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:36,410
Oh, they're just holding hands!

1716
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:40,810
It's not fair!

1717
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:45,430
Like...

1718
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:45,870
Oh, god.

1719
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:47,850
Oh, he's looking at me.

1720
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:48,570
No!

1721
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:59,150
Why, when I play support, my support doesn't hold my hand.

1722
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:00,670
But when...

1723
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:03,830
In quick play, they hold each other's hands.

1724
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,250
Why are you holding...

1725
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,390
Yes, you don't gain any damage.

1726
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:08,570
Anything from holding hands in quick play!

1727
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:11,410
It's okay.

1728
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:13,790
I'll just farm them from here.

1729
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:18,770
I'm gonna wait until fucking they got tired of invisible women.

1730
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:20,190
I'm just gonna farm.

1731
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:21,250
I'm just gonna frontline here.

1732
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:22,750
And just farm this.

1733
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:23,950
Farm art like this.

1734
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:25,290
Like...

1735
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:27,330
Like, it's just so easy.

1736
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:29,190
You just shoot like that.

1737
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:30,970
Like...

1738
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:31,470
Oh, shit!

1739
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:33,450
Oh, not the moon!

1740
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:35,610
No!

1741
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:36,090
No!

1742
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:37,430
No, please!

1743
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:39,210
I'm just a little guy!

1744
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:41,990
Please!

1745
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:47,870
Okay, the one thing I do miss from Luna is the snowflake.

1746
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:50,580
The snowflake for flankers.

1747
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:52,030
Not the moon.

1748
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:54,010
Not the moon.

1749
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,790
Don't make me pull out the Punisher!

1750
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:58,410
Cause I will do it if I'm desperate.

1751
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:03,670
I refuse to lose a quick play match.

1752
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:06,470
Jesus Christ.

1753
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:09,070
Reed, go back to your fucking wife!

1754
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:10,410
She's lonely!

1755
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:13,650
That's right.

1756
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:15,510
You can't walk backwards from this!

1757
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:16,990
You can't walk backwards!

1758
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:22,510
Go back to your wife.

1759
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:23,310
She's lonely.

1760
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:26,910
Oh my god.

1761
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:27,910
Am I getting...

1762
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:28,570
Oh, shoot!

1763
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:34,890
That's right.

1764
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:37,510
You can't walk backwards from it.

1765
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:40,130
Alright.

1766
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:41,450
It's fine.

1767
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:42,370
I like Psylocke.

1768
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:45,750
She's actually one of my favorite characters to play in general.

1769
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:47,150
Are they...

1770
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:48,250
What is your plan?

1771
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:49,690
What...

1772
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:51,090
What is your plan?

1773
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:54,790
What is...

1774
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:55,610
What...

1775
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,230
What is...

1776
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:59,430
What was your plan, sir?

1777
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:01,350
What was it?

1778
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:02,670
I can't.

1779
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:04,230
I'm too scared to go in there.

1780
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:04,810
I'm...

1781
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:05,210
Oh my god.

1782
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:05,970
There they are.

1783
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:07,930
The moon!

1784
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:12,070
I'm too scared to go in.

1785
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:13,590
I don't know.

1786
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:15,490
It just seems incredibly dangerous.

1787
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:17,510
Oh.

1788
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:19,110
Get rid of this.

1789
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:20,050
I just...

1790
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:20,290
What?

1791
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:20,690
Oh.

1792
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:21,210
Oh.

1793
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:21,470
Oh.

1794
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:22,930
That's why everybody was here.

1795
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:23,210
Okay.

1796
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:24,430
That makes more sense now.

1797
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:25,110
Okay.

1798
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:26,510
Now I wonder...

1799
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,490
I was like, why is everybody there?

1800
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:29,190
Oh.

1801
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:30,410
Because...

1802
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:31,610
Goodbye, wife.

1803
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,190
Goodbye, Loki.

1804
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:34,990
Oh, no.

1805
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:35,410
It's him.

1806
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:37,850
It's the smaller Fantastic.

1807
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,470
Come on.

1808
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:42,830
I'm gonna beat you up.

1809
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:44,070
Get over here.

1810
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:44,870
Yes.

1811
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:47,530
We did it.

1812
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:48,370
Yay!

1813
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:51,850
So easy.

1814
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:54,030
Man.

1815
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:54,750
What are you gonna do?

1816
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:55,490
Touch the point?

1817
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:58,170
Not Fantastic?

1818
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:00,010
Mr. Fantastic.

1819
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:04,150
Alright.

1820
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:05,250
Now...

1821
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:07,810
Now I should be able to play...

1822
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:09,490
The...

1823
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:10,850
Invisible Woman, right?

1824
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:14,350
Mr. Adequate.

1825
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:15,470
Mr. Average.

1826
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:16,710
Just like my badge.

1827
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:18,990
Just like...

1828
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:20,050
Oh my god.

1829
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:21,450
Just like my badge.

1830
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:28,290
It's okay, guys.

1831
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:29,030
It's okay.

1832
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:31,910
I'm pretty sure they can see it.

1833
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:32,730
I'm...

1834
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:33,190
God, please.

1835
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:33,830
Please.

1836
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:34,610
Alright.

1837
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,650
I got the right blonde woman this time.

1838
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:38,290
I got the right one.

1839
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:41,590
It's alright.

1840
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:43,330
Mr. Some part.

1841
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:45,710
Here we go.

1842
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:47,610
It's not small.

1843
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:48,910
It's not...

1844
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:49,330
Guys!

1845
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:50,330
It's not...

1846
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:52,010
It's not small.

1847
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:52,830
It's...

1848
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:52,910
It's not small.

1849
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:53,770
And it's not...

1850
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,090
And it's not the size.

1851
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:56,550
It's how you use it.

1852
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:57,130
And I...

1853
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:57,750
And when...

1854
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:00,690
And I got top 500 using it.

1855
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:03,430
I...

1856
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:05,350
Hey, guys.

1857
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:10,830
Alright.

1858
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:13,750
Let me check out how to play Miss Fantastic.

1859
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:16,950
Because I feel like I would be such a troll if I play her in rank.

1860
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:19,330
I definitely need to figure out how to play her.

1861
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:21,630
Because I feel like she's gonna be...

1862
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:22,030
I don't know.

1863
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:23,410
I feel like she's gonna be meta.

1864
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:25,330
Because her...

1865
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:26,070
I don't know if her heal...

1866
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:27,530
Is her heal output good?

1867
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,050
Like Luna?

1868
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:32,010
Oh my god.

1869
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:32,530
My husband.

1870
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:33,370
Hello, husband.

1871
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:34,610
Don't worry.

1872
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:35,250
Haha!

1873
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:39,250
Alright.

1874
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:42,430
I'm gonna see how to play her.

1875
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:43,810
I already forgot her stuff.

1876
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:44,750
What is her...

1877
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,030
Her left click is the...

1878
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:47,590
Okay, yeah.

1879
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:48,410
That's what it is.

1880
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:49,950
And I can like...

1881
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:52,370
I basically can just spam this all the time.

1882
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:53,690
And it heals.

1883
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:56,170
Okay.

1884
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:58,670
Yeah, the shield seems like...

1885
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:01,150
The shield seems like it heals a lot in general.

1886
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:02,250
Don't worry.

1887
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:04,210
I'll come back in like...

1888
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:05,170
Wait, what is my E again?

1889
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:07,130
Oh, shit!

1890
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:08,770
That's fucking right.

1891
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:10,290
That's right!

1892
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:11,590
You try to dab me?

1893
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:14,450
Yeah, I need to like figure out how to aim with this.

1894
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:15,950
I need to...

1895
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:18,630
Oh, no.

1896
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:19,250
Oh, no.

1897
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:19,890
No!

1898
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:21,250
I got squirreled!

1899
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:23,970
Okay, I need to figure out how to...

1900
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:26,010
I need to figure out this projectile of this.

1901
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:27,510
Because like...

1902
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:29,210
The projectile seems scary.

1903
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:31,210
Like, really difficult to aim.

1904
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:31,650
Yeah.

1905
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:33,730
Oh, did he live?

1906
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:35,350
Oh, no.

1907
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:36,410
Oh, no.

1908
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:37,510
Oh, no.

1909
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:38,770
Oh, thank god.

1910
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:39,670
The map changed.

1911
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:40,870
I got squirreled.

1912
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:45,230
Oh.

1913
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:47,110
Oh, that's awkward.

1914
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:49,090
That's very awkward.

1915
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:50,610
That's...

1916
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:51,470
Oh, my god.

1917
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:52,950
The map changed!

1918
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:58,810
Oh, my god.

1919
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:59,910
That's so unlucky.

1920
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:01,570
I got the map.

1921
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:02,690
Don't worry, Raccoon.

1922
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:03,770
I will save us.

1923
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:05,130
Don't worry.

1924
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:08,230
I will save us.

1925
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:09,650
Husband, please!

1926
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:11,490
Mr. Fantastic!

1927
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:17,010
Okay, that pulls people in.

1928
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:17,810
Okay.

1929
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:20,030
Jesus Christ.

1930
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:20,830
Alright.

1931
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:24,210
I need to, like, figure out how to use her shields better, too.

1932
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:26,690
Oh, please.

1933
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:28,430
Oh, my god.

1934
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:29,150
Push him away.

1935
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:30,350
Push him away.

1936
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:31,050
No!

1937
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:35,970
Yeah, her...

1938
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:36,270
Okay.

1939
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:37,950
Her heal output is not...

1940
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:38,550
She's a...

1941
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:39,510
She's a flex support.

1942
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:41,110
Okay, now I realize...

1943
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:45,090
Her...

1944
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:46,870
She has so many buttons.

1945
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,170
It, like, gets confusing.

1946
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:49,030
Okay.

1947
01:05:49,790 --> 01:05:54,610
I need to realize that, like, her heal output is not as good as I thought it is.

1948
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:56,650
And, like...

1949
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:57,630
Oh, my god.

1950
01:05:58,070 --> 01:05:59,970
Her heal output is not that good in general.

1951
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:00,910
I realize.

1952
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:04,350
Wait, I can reflect this.

1953
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:04,690
Okay.

1954
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:06,090
Yeah.

1955
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:08,230
Oh, Captain.

1956
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:09,230
Oh, my god.

1957
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:10,070
Oh, my...

1958
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:10,430
Please!

1959
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:11,650
I can't do anything!

1960
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:13,410
The Captain just dies me!

1961
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:15,170
He's so strong!

1962
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:19,990
Her ult seems good, though.

1963
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:22,870
Her ult seems really good, but, like...

1964
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:25,710
Also, I don't think it's, like, viable...

1965
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:30,470
It's very hard to use her in quick play because people are not stacking up in quick play.

1966
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:31,690
So...

1967
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:33,510
Like, if it was...

1968
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:39,010
If it was, like, not quick play, I think it would be different in general.

1969
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:40,570
I feel.

1970
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:42,890
Just cause, like, I think in quick...

1971
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:43,710
Oh, my god.

1972
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:49,250
I think, like, in ranked, people would be more stacked up to use it viably.

1973
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:51,190
In general.

1974
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:53,830
Oh, my god.

1975
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:54,210
Please.

1976
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:55,250
Where's my Panther?

1977
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:57,570
Stay invisible?

1978
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:00,370
Well, to be invisible, I need to, like, have my...

1979
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:01,810
I should say my jump cooldown.

1980
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:02,390
Yeah.

1981
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:05,350
Yeah.

1982
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:08,610
The more it hits a person, the more damage heal she gives.

1983
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:12,670
Yeah, I just think, like, in quick play, it's definitely harder to utilize her in quick play.

1984
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:14,370
Just cause, like...

1985
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:16,970
Just cause, like, everybody is so spread out.

1986
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:18,750
Everybody's...

1987
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:22,750
People don't play, like, together in quick play a lot.

1988
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:24,910
But, like, especially for cough.

1989
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:27,850
People don't play together in cough, so it's really difficult.

1990
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:30,530
Okay.

1991
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:34,230
I just need to make sure I save my jump for when I get died.

1992
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:37,010
And then save my E for, like...

1993
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:39,030
You save my E for when I get died.

1994
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:40,970
And then also my fist, too.

1995
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:44,290
Okay, I gotta make sure.

1996
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:45,510
And the shift...

1997
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:46,850
Shift, it seems...

1998
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:49,370
Okay, I need to remember the shift and then the shield.

1999
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:50,830
Shield time.

2000
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:52,530
They're so...

2001
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:53,450
Oh, my god.

2002
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,930
She has so much kit to her utility.

2003
01:07:57,770 --> 01:07:59,910
That, like, it gets so confusing.

2004
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:03,270
I think I can...

2005
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:06,390
I definitely think, like, it's gonna take me a while to learn her.

2006
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:07,850
Because...

2007
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,810
She seems, like...

2008
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:11,930
She just seems, like, a lot.

2009
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:13,850
You know?

2010
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:19,970
She definitely...

2011
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,670
She is a lot.

2012
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,730
There we go.

2013
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:29,870
You know what?

2014
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:30,530
Fuck it.

2015
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:31,770
Disappear!

2016
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:34,470
That's right!

2017
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:35,290
Easy.

2018
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:39,050
Easy.

2019
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:40,130
Can I get a high ground?

2020
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:41,390
Oh, I can't reach it.

2021
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:44,210
She has a lot of kit.

2022
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:45,770
I'm gonna get, like, super over...

2023
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:48,950
I'm getting, like, super overwhelmed right now.

2024
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:49,730
Playing her.

2025
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:51,890
Because there's just a lot to her.

2026
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:53,610
Her cooldowns, though...

2027
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:55,570
I'd say her cooldowns...

2028
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:56,810
Like, she has...

2029
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:58,390
There's just so much.

2030
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:01,850
Alright.

2031
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,510
And I didn't figure out how to aim with her.

2032
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:06,570
In general.

2033
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:12,590
I need to figure out how to aim with this character.

2034
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:13,530
Wait, what?

2035
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:15,230
What the fuck?

2036
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:16,770
Alright.

2037
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:20,970
Because I feel like, aim-wise...

2038
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:22,710
Her projectile is weird.

2039
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:23,550
It's not hitscan.

2040
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:24,850
I'm not very good at...

2041
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:26,450
I'm not very good at projectile.

2042
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:31,350
Yeah, the shield is static, but it's still...

2043
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:32,030
Oh my god.

2044
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:32,690
The shield...

2045
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:34,330
I'm gonna get it back in four seconds, anyway.

2046
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,230
The shield is static, but the cooldown is so fast.

2047
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:39,170
And I can just spam it.

2048
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:40,510
Like, I can just do that.

2049
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:43,730
Aim and feet?

2050
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:45,430
Oh no, not the...

2051
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:46,930
Oh no, don't get crushed!

2052
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:47,650
Don't get crushed!

2053
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:49,650
Don't get crushed!

2054
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:52,890
Don't get crushed, guys!

2055
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:54,950
Oh my god, don't worry!

2056
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,030
I'm invisible.

2057
01:09:57,210 --> 01:09:58,070
Where could I be?

2058
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:58,970
That's fucking right.

2059
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:00,890
That's fucking right.

2060
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:04,410
That's right, bitch!

2061
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:05,250
Oh, I got...

2062
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:09,950
It's okay.

2063
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:10,550
I...

2064
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:11,910
I sent a message.

2065
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:12,450
Okay?

2066
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:13,650
I sent a message.

2067
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,170
That's all that matters.

2068
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:16,870
Yeah, the stor...

2069
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:18,310
I heard she got buffed hard.

2070
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:21,490
She got really buffed.

2071
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:22,930
Again!

2072
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:27,010
Again!

2073
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:30,590
Okay.

2074
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:33,350
Oh, that's bad.

2075
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,490
I should have heals here.

2076
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:36,830
Alright.

2077
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:41,090
It's okay.

2078
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:42,150
You're too far!

2079
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:44,610
You're just a little bit too far!

2080
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:47,970
I...

2081
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:48,410
Like, I...

2082
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,510
Like, sometimes I forget I have a shield too.

2083
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:51,670
Oh my god.

2084
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:55,910
Okay.

2085
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:57,970
I don't know if that would do anything.

2086
01:10:58,230 --> 01:10:58,950
That's fine.

2087
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:02,110
It's fine.

2088
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:05,030
Wait, I can pull him in!

2089
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:05,770
Watch this!

2090
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:07,150
Okay, I pulled him off.

2091
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:08,670
I pulled him off!

2092
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:09,170
I pulled him away!

2093
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:11,190
Sorry, I'm still...

2094
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:13,950
I'm still figuring out that utility, guys!

2095
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:15,330
Guys, I'm...

2096
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:16,350
I'm still figuring...

2097
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:16,990
Where did he go?

2098
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:17,810
Oh, yes!

2099
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:20,290
But what if I disappear too?

2100
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:22,270
What you gonna do about that?

2101
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:23,470
That's right!

2102
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:26,090
What if I also disappear?

2103
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:28,350
That's fucking right!

2104
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:30,730
Oh shit!

2105
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:32,690
Oh my god!

2106
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:34,470
Oh my god!

2107
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:36,750
Oh no, he's coming over!

2108
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:37,970
He's coming over!

2109
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:46,030
I didn't remember left click is pushed away and...

2110
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:47,050
Holy shit!

2111
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:48,990
Guys, I'm scared.

2112
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:50,490
I'm scared.

2113
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:55,950
As a support player, I'm very scared about the Storm Buffs.

2114
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:57,330
I'm...

2115
01:11:58,570 --> 01:12:04,010
I'm incredibly scared about the Storm Buffs.

2116
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:10,930
She seems very scary.

2117
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:15,210
I feel like, I feel like I will definitely die a lot of the storm.

2118
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:21,530
Totally figuring out.

2119
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:24,380
I definitely will not be playing her in rank right off the bat.

2120
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:26,810
Because like, she's...

2121
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:28,350
her utility...

2122
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:36,170
Like, I need to fucking always remember to use shield, to use my shield, my shift, and then like this.

2123
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,670
Like, it's just so much...

2124
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:40,230
I'm sorry, I say buff her.

2125
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:42,930
She has the lowest pick in rank of all time.

2126
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:44,490
Not all, I'm sorry, not all of all time.

2127
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:47,530
But she's one of the worst characters to play in rank during season zero.

2128
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:50,590
So there was no, so of course they had to buff her.

2129
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:55,650
What I'm very surprised by is why the fuck did they buff Wolverine?

2130
01:12:55,930 --> 01:13:01,930
Because now, now I have to worry about, now I have to worry about banning Wolverine and Storm.

2131
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:06,590
Wolverine did not need a buff.

2132
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:14,890
He's already so scary under the right, like, under the right hands, like in high elo.

2133
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:18,090
He's, he's really good in high elo.

2134
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,610
God, his like...

2135
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:26,050
That's the only thing I'm like, not like a huge fan of.

2136
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:29,250
And that is like, uh...

2137
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:31,910
Okay, sorry, I need to fucking make sure I don't die.

2138
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:33,150
I don't fucking die.

2139
01:13:35,090 --> 01:13:37,670
God, I need to make sure not to shoot my hands.

2140
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:46,510
It's so difficult to not shoot your hands afterwards, because I'm so used to, I'm so used to just keep shooting.

2141
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:50,510
So I need to like, after I jump, I need to just be invisible.

2142
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:55,110
I need to not touch anything after I jump.

2143
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:58,650
I need to like, be like, use my restraint there.

2144
01:14:01,090 --> 01:14:03,870
The projectile comes back faster if you aim at the floor.

2145
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:08,150
Yeah, but why, why?

2146
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,290
Oh shit, okay.

2147
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,030
Sorry, I got healed.

2148
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:14,270
All right, that's fine.

2149
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:14,990
Get in here.

2150
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:16,770
Get in here, fake husband.

2151
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:18,410
Don't worry, I have...

2152
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:21,710
Yeah, I need to remember my shield.

2153
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:23,750
Disappear!

2154
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:24,410
Disappear!

2155
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:25,810
Oh my god, how many?

2156
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:27,050
Okay, I don't have that many.

2157
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:29,350
Okay, I thought I had a lot of discs, but that's fine.

2158
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:32,270
Okay.

2159
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:37,230
Did they, did they buff Thor too, right?

2160
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:40,030
Serious.

2161
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:44,270
They also buffed Thor, so I need to remember that.

2162
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:48,450
Don't worry, it's healing him.

2163
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:50,230
Don't worry.

2164
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:54,110
It's okay.

2165
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:58,150
Please, it's so fine.

2166
01:14:58,250 --> 01:14:59,790
Okay, now he's self-healed.

2167
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:02,270
All right.

2168
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:04,590
I'm okay.

2169
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:07,770
Oh wait, did my, did my stream, did my stream die a little bit?

2170
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:08,590
That's weird.

2171
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:11,790
Oh.

2172
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:13,990
My right click.

2173
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:15,150
Cheers!

2174
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:17,970
Holy shit, that's fucking right.

2175
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:19,430
You try to grab me, I'm married.

2176
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:19,470
I'm married.

2177
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,630
I'm Mr. Fantastic.

2178
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:35,870
Don't touch me, I have a, I'm Mr. Fantastic.

2179
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:47,370
You know what, I'm gonna grab.

2180
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,650
That's not a great idea.

2181
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:50,990
Okay, why did I do that?

2182
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:57,730
Oh my god, why did I do that?

2183
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:01,730
Storm stream, see what he said.

2184
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:02,450
Disappear?

2185
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:03,510
He did it, really?

2186
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:06,030
Oh, that's, that's really funny.

2187
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:07,350
Disappear.

2188
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:10,430
Don't worry.

2189
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:12,990
Oh shit, don't worry, disappear!

2190
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:14,970
Get in here!

2191
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:17,270
Guys, we gotta disappear!

2192
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:20,130
Oh, I don't think we're gonna win.

2193
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:22,090
I don't think, oh.

2194
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:24,990
I don't want to disappear, guys.

2195
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:28,070
I don't, I don't want to disappear.

2196
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:37,310
Uh, super, thank you for the super chat.

2197
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:38,150
Thank you, thank you.

2198
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:42,330
Mr. Fantastic is so OP that the stream disappeared the moment she streamed it.

2199
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:42,870
Amazing.

2200
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:44,330
Oh, Mrs. Fantastic, amazing.

2201
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:46,130
Thank you for the super chat, super.

2202
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:46,590
Thank you.

2203
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:47,170
Thank you.

2204
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:48,750
She...

2205
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:51,570
She is...

2206
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:53,830
She is not...

2207
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:57,110
Mrs. Fantastic is not fun to play in quick play.

2208
01:16:57,210 --> 01:16:57,770
I'll say it.

2209
01:16:57,790 --> 01:17:02,470
I think if I play her in rank, it'd be a lot easier.

2210
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:07,050
In quick play, it's definitely, oh my god, look at everybody playing it.

2211
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:10,830
It's definitely a lot harder to play.

2212
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:13,150
Uh, how are you diamond already?

2213
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:15,630
Jesus Christ, what the fuck, people are diamond already?

2214
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:17,490
I literally, I...

2215
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:21,930
Yeah, um...

2216
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:29,690
In quick play, everybody is like way too spread out for me to actually, uh, do anything in quick play.

2217
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:32,390
So...

2218
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:33,870
Um...

2219
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:34,690
Oh, yeah, they went.

2220
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:35,330
Oh, we had a break.

2221
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:37,070
It's been one hour!

2222
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:38,810
It's...

2223
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:42,330
It's literally, it's been one hour.

2224
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:44,230
How are you guys here already?

2225
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:47,270
I, how are you guys here?

2226
01:17:49,150 --> 01:17:50,950
I don't understand.

2227
01:17:55,410 --> 01:17:58,090
Okay, I know, like, I had someone I wanted to play rank.

2228
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:02,770
All right, I'm not sure yet.

2229
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:06,110
I'm not sure they are still down because, like, they at, uh, uh...

2230
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:08,770
So, like, I'm not sure yet.

2231
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:09,650
Let me...

2232
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:11,750
I like to keep, like...

2233
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:14,750
Um, oh wait, these are, oh fuck, I forgot rank reset.

2234
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:18,370
So these guys could actually be, I forgot rank reset in itself.

2235
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:20,770
Um...

2236
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:21,870
You know, you want to do rank.

2237
01:18:21,970 --> 01:18:26,990
Yeah, I want to do, like, one or two games of rank and then, um...

2238
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:31,050
And then, um, and then call it there.

2239
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:31,890
Because I...

2240
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:34,530
I played a lot of rank already today.

2241
01:18:34,770 --> 01:18:35,170
I...

2242
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:36,950
Are you gonna go to Celestio?

2243
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:38,130
Celestio!

2244
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:39,750
I'm going to what?

2245
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:40,610
Okay, wait.

2246
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:41,670
I'm going to eternity.

2247
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:44,030
I don't know about one above all, guys.

2248
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:45,230
I, um...

2249
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:46,490
I...

2250
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:49,310
I don't know about one above all.

2251
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:52,750
We'll, we'll, we'll aim for eternity, guys.

2252
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:57,950
I'm gonna do... Okay, I'm gonna... Oh, wait.

2253
01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:00,810
I'm most likely just gonna do what?

2254
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:02,710
Maybe, uh, two games.

2255
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:15,130
All right, I'm gonna do maybe, like, one or two games and then call it there because...

2256
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,810
Because we played a lot.

2257
01:19:17,930 --> 01:19:21,760
I need you to know... Okay, I'll show you guys how the... Okay, so...

2258
01:19:23,730 --> 01:19:25,250
What time did I start?

2259
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:26,770
I started out here.

2260
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:34,630
I started out here.

2261
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:39,500
And then... And then... And then...

2262
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:46,500
Oh, we... And then... And then... And then... We ended here.

2263
01:19:50,130 --> 01:19:52,560
At one point, this was hell.

2264
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:53,740
This was actual...

2265
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,280
That this was hell, honestly.

2266
01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:00,880
This was... This was... This was a lot.

2267
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:01,750
This...

2268
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:05,990
This, this was a lie.

2269
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:13,110
It was, it was, the, the zebra was, I was gonna fucking, oh my god, I was, okay.

2270
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:16,450
I was gonna, oh my, I was gonna fucking, oh.

2271
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:17,430
Alright, alright, whatever.

2272
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:18,710
Alright, alright.

2273
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:21,590
Oh wait, I'm fucking, oh I'm leader.

2274
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:22,390
Alright, let's go.

2275
01:20:23,370 --> 01:20:24,230
Let's fucking go.

2276
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:26,410
Okay.

2277
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:34,750
By the way, so we played with Gomez for, uh, for the, uh.

2278
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:37,890
Oh yeah, by the way, he's also a Hololive fan, I found out.

2279
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:41,250
Uh, but we played with Gomez and like the stack he made.

2280
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:46,610
So like, I made a lot of new friends, uh, cause like, I was crashing out hard.

2281
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:55,870
But, but like, apparently, cause he, he's like a fan of GG, uh, from Hololive.

2282
01:20:55,870 --> 01:21:00,070
Cause like, when I showed him the, cause the Twitch Rivals team list.

2283
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:08,650
Um, he was like, uh, one person that's in the Twitch Rivals, Marble Rivals, was GG.

2284
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:10,770
But it wasn't the Hololive GG.

2285
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:13,830
It was, um, you know, Pokeloid's girlfriend.

2286
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:19,870
And then, but he like freaked out and was like, oh my god, is that GG from Hololive?

2287
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:23,230
And I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2288
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:24,090
Oh my god.

2289
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:35,670
So, so yeah, I was like, no, no, no, that's, that's a real person.

2290
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:38,370
It's not, it's not the VTuber.

2291
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:42,150
It's, it's the, it's the real person.

2292
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:52,630
So, uh, but yeah, anyway, as I was saying, uh, um, he was part of the problem.

2293
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:55,770
Of why this looks like this.

2294
01:21:56,750 --> 01:22:05,790
Why, of why this, of why, of why we, we went from here to, to here.

2295
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:13,590
Anyway,

2296
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:19,330
but here we go.

2297
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:24,290
By the way, during that entire grind, he apparently had one hour of sleep throughout it.

2298
01:22:24,290 --> 01:22:29,810
I have no idea how the fuck, how, I have no idea how he's, he's still alive right now.

2299
01:22:29,870 --> 01:22:33,010
Wait, is, is the gold not the best one?

2300
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:38,870
Wait, am I supposed to equip the platinum one?

2301
01:22:39,170 --> 01:22:45,210
I, I, I actually, I actually don't know.

2302
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:48,950
Wait, is, oh wait, no, gold is, no, he's not top 500.

2303
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,090
Oh my god, you're right.

2304
01:22:50,330 --> 01:22:51,310
He's not top 500.

2305
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:55,930
That's right, he's not top 500.

2306
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:59,410
So, I get to, I, gold is the best one.

2307
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:02,010
Gold is the best.

2308
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:06,510
Oh my god, everybody here is just the lord.

2309
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:11,890
Oh my god, I'm the best player here and I'm on support.

2310
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:13,690
I, I'm not risking Ms. Fantastic.

2311
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:16,630
I feel like, I don't know, I'm scared.

2312
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:18,950
I feel like I'm gonna throw.

2313
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:22,670
If I try to play Ms. Fantastic, I'm gonna like...

2314
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:28,050
I feel like I'm gonna throw.

2315
01:23:28,230 --> 01:23:29,130
I don't know!

2316
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:31,830
I don't know!

2317
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:35,070
But he's fantastic.

2318
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:39,190
It's the start, you're right, it's the start of the season.

2319
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:41,370
What's the worst that could happen?

2320
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:44,770
You're right, it's plat, I can risk it.

2321
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:46,070
I can risk it in plat.

2322
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:47,650
I'll swap to Luna if I throw.

2323
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:50,950
You're right.

2324
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:52,590
You're right.

2325
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:54,270
What's the worst that could happen?

2326
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:55,150
I lose?

2327
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:01,390
You're right, start of the season is better to learn this.

2328
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:06,290
Even though everybody technically, everybody technically over here...

2329
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:07,070
Wait!

2330
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,710
Holy shit, I told you!

2331
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:10,830
Enraged, this is so OP!

2332
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:11,670
Enraged!

2333
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:13,430
I told you!

2334
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:18,750
It's so OP in rank when everybody is grouped up.

2335
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:23,760
I told you.

2336
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,220
This is...

2337
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:27,080
This is so worth it.

2338
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:29,420
This is so worth it in rank.

2339
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:30,980
Oh my god.

2340
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,700
Like, they're just all there.

2341
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,220
They're just...

2342
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:36,560
They're just all...

2343
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,280
Oh my god, they're just all there!

2344
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:42,120
They're just all there.

2345
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,820
Like, look at that.

2346
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:46,380
Look at them all just grouped up together.

2347
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,400
Look at that.

2348
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:54,320
Oh my god, they're just...

2349
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:57,020
They're just lining up for me like little lemons.

2350
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:00,240
See, it's not a throw.

2351
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:01,700
It's not a throw.

2352
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:03,180
My shield was down.

2353
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,160
It's my shield was down.

2354
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:07,820
Look at that.

2355
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,400
Like little lemons, they just group up for me.

2356
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:12,780
Oh my god, wait.

2357
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,040
I think I can do this.

2358
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:17,600
Okay, that is not what I want to hear.

2359
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:18,360
Who said that?

2360
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:19,420
Our tank.

2361
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:22,960
Okay, that is not what I want to hear from my tank right now.

2362
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,380
That's not what I want to hear.

2363
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:29,060
We're fine.

2364
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:32,920
It's okay.

2365
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:35,480
Oh my god.

2366
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:36,040
No.

2367
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:36,660
No.

2368
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:38,320
Oh my god, I tried.

2369
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:38,840
I swear.

2370
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:39,640
It's fine.

2371
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:40,740
Disappear!

2372
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:48,540
I think my teammates right here.

2373
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:49,940
I think that's where they are.

2374
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:54,980
Oh shit.

2375
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:56,000
Oh shit.

2376
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:56,860
Oh shit.

2377
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,100
I think that's where they are, guys.

2378
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:59,800
I think that's where they are.

2379
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:02,340
I need to make sure not to shoot my arms.

2380
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:03,940
I need to make sure...

2381
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:04,840
I can't help it.

2382
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,060
Oh no.

2383
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:08,440
That's right.

2384
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:09,580
I'm not invisible.

2385
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:12,200
That's right.

2386
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:15,220
I'm not invisible.

2387
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:16,260
It's okay.

2388
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:19,080
Okay.

2389
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,380
It's okay.

2390
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:22,320
I...

2391
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,420
My shield was...

2392
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:23,740
Okay.

2393
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:24,800
The ult...

2394
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,960
It has 300 HP, guys.

2395
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,700
It's not like...

2396
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:30,600
It's not infinite, guys.

2397
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:31,520
It has...

2398
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,360
It has 300 HP.

2399
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:36,880
Like, despite what you want to think.

2400
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,500
It's not infinite.

2401
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,880
Oh shit, nice.

2402
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:43,740
Alright.

2403
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:45,380
For Wakanda, let's go.

2404
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:47,420
300...

2405
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:49,620
300 plus overtime here.

2406
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,320
Like, it can break, guys.

2407
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:54,620
It can actually break, guys.

2408
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:57,100
Okay.

2409
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:57,760
Oh shit!

2410
01:26:58,180 --> 01:26:58,720
That's right.

2411
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,260
That's fucking right.

2412
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:05,640
I don't know if I'm doing okay.

2413
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,000
I legitimately don't know.

2414
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,660
I don't know.

2415
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:13,740
I can't tell.

2416
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:17,300
I can't tell right now.

2417
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:21,240
I don't know what I'm doing, too.

2418
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:24,160
Wait, I have Wolverine as ult, right?

2419
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:26,440
I can't disappear.

2420
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:27,500
I can't disappear.

2421
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,380
I can't disappear.

2422
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:31,720
That's right.

2423
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:33,120
Where am I?

2424
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:34,960
Where am I?

2425
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:35,500
I can't.

2426
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,960
I can't do any moves, though.

2427
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:37,960
If I'm disappeared.

2428
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:39,500
Wait, what?

2429
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:40,760
What?

2430
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,620
He's so dead.

2431
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:45,680
There's no way he lives.

2432
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,260
There's no way.

2433
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:50,640
Oh my god.

2434
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:52,280
Oh my god.

2435
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:53,980
I'm okay.

2436
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,800
I'm so healthy.

2437
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:57,360
Watch this.

2438
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:58,520
Disappear!

2439
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:01,160
Where am I?

2440
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:02,340
Oh my god.

2441
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:02,620
No.

2442
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:03,900
No, not my ult.

2443
01:28:07,150 --> 01:28:10,290
No, not my...

2444
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:12,010
Oh my god.

2445
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:13,050
Oh my god.

2446
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:15,770
He took me out of my ult.

2447
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:19,190
He took me out of my ult.

2448
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:20,570
That should be illegal.

2449
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:27,890
That's right.

2450
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:29,930
I'll make sure you disappear, alright?

2451
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:32,410
Jesus Christ.

2452
01:28:35,370 --> 01:28:36,310
Oh my god.

2453
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:36,950
Please.

2454
01:28:37,190 --> 01:28:38,090
Please live.

2455
01:28:38,370 --> 01:28:38,890
Everybody.

2456
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:44,590
I realized because we're in plat that nothing...

2457
01:28:44,590 --> 01:28:45,510
We can't ban anything.

2458
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:49,370
So, like, that's the one thing I'm very scared about.

2459
01:28:49,710 --> 01:28:50,150
We...

2460
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:51,710
We can't...

2461
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:52,530
We...

2462
01:28:52,530 --> 01:28:57,150
We can't ban anything right now, so everything is available.

2463
01:28:57,710 --> 01:28:58,550
So, like...

2464
01:28:59,030 --> 01:28:59,790
Oh, man.

2465
01:28:59,890 --> 01:29:01,610
That's so rough.

2466
01:29:02,450 --> 01:29:04,510
That's actually gonna be...

2467
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:06,050
Oh, no.

2468
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:06,950
Oh, no.

2469
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:07,770
Oh, no.

2470
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:09,970
What do I do when they disappear?

2471
01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:12,810
What do I do?

2472
01:29:13,730 --> 01:29:14,470
Oh, nice.

2473
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:14,910
Nothing.

2474
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:15,730
I don't have to worry.

2475
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:17,790
I don't have to worry.

2476
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:18,590
That's fine.

2477
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:23,390
I forgot the ban stopped existing.

2478
01:29:24,130 --> 01:29:25,770
I need to use my E more, too.

2479
01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:27,350
I don't use my E at all.

2480
01:29:28,690 --> 01:29:29,830
Like, right now.

2481
01:29:37,630 --> 01:29:38,190
Alright.

2482
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:41,970
It's technically not a throw yet.

2483
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:43,170
Technically.

2484
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:46,810
Technically, we're not throwing at the moment.

2485
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:48,510
I'm getting...

2486
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:50,470
I'm getting bodied and everything is stuttering.

2487
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:51,290
I'm so sorry.

2488
01:29:51,550 --> 01:29:54,190
So, technically, we don't even have a tank right now.

2489
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:56,870
We don't even...

2490
01:29:56,870 --> 01:29:58,370
Wait, how are you guys stuttering?

2491
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:01,990
It's fine.

2492
01:30:02,290 --> 01:30:03,250
I mean, 12-2.

2493
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:05,810
Wait, we're doing better than our DPS.

2494
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:06,890
That's pretty good.

2495
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:09,490
The only good player...

2496
01:30:09,490 --> 01:30:11,750
That's crazy because, like, these are all Eternity players.

2497
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:12,510
I'm pretty sure.

2498
01:30:14,730 --> 01:30:15,650
In this elo.

2499
01:30:16,690 --> 01:30:17,770
I'm pretty sure.

2500
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:19,410
I need to use my...

2501
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:21,550
I need to use my melee, too, more.

2502
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:24,390
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

2503
01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:29,110
Yeah, they have to be at least GM to be in my lobby.

2504
01:30:33,130 --> 01:30:34,090
Okay, not...

2505
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:34,910
This hurts.

2506
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:37,350
Like...

2507
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:39,750
I don't know.

2508
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:40,990
Is it just me?

2509
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:42,150
Or is this posture?

2510
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:44,990
My back cracked when I did that.

2511
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:51,290
My back actually cracked when I tried to do that posture.

2512
01:30:57,430 --> 01:31:00,210
No, I do not have the gamer posture.

2513
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:02,450
What do I do?

2514
01:31:02,710 --> 01:31:03,630
I'm gonna break this.

2515
01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:05,990
I fucking hate windows.

2516
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:09,730
Where are they gonna go?

2517
01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:11,930
Oh, shit.

2518
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:14,430
Are they okay?

2519
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:17,290
I don't...

2520
01:31:17,290 --> 01:31:17,630
Okay.

2521
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:19,730
I don't know where to...

2522
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:20,490
Oh my god.

2523
01:31:20,530 --> 01:31:21,280
Okay, I guess...

2524
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:24,950
Alright, now it's gone.

2525
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:25,870
Wait, that's up here.

2526
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:28,170
Oh no.

2527
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:29,490
Oh no.

2528
01:31:30,370 --> 01:31:30,950
Disappear.

2529
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:33,790
Oh my god.

2530
01:31:33,910 --> 01:31:34,670
You don't know.

2531
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:35,450
He doesn't know.

2532
01:31:35,530 --> 01:31:36,230
I'm just gonna push shield.

2533
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:36,830
I gave up.

2534
01:31:43,390 --> 01:31:44,350
I'm just...

2535
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:47,950
I decided that I'm just gonna use my...

2536
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:49,810
I gave up, guys.

2537
01:31:54,490 --> 01:31:55,190
It's okay.

2538
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:56,810
I'm still healing though.

2539
01:31:58,590 --> 01:31:59,770
I got the shield up.

2540
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:01,190
I got the shield up.

2541
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:02,230
Wolverine, live!

2542
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:02,930
Wolverine!

2543
01:32:04,570 --> 01:32:06,810
Okay, I need you guys to stand on point though.

2544
01:32:07,370 --> 01:32:08,110
Like, I...

2545
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:09,930
I really need you guys.

2546
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:13,110
Okay, but what if I...

2547
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:16,870
What if I...

2548
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:19,470
What if I just do that?

2549
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:22,310
Disappear!

2550
01:32:23,230 --> 01:32:23,630
Fight here!

2551
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:24,050
Fight here!

2552
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:24,530
Fight here!

2553
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:27,830
Fight here!

2554
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:28,890
I'm pushing away!

2555
01:32:28,890 --> 01:32:29,910
No!

2556
01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:30,370
No!

2557
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:31,450
Oh my god, no!

2558
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:32,330
I don't want to disappear!

2559
01:32:33,770 --> 01:32:34,270
Oh no.

2560
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:35,230
I know.

2561
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:37,210
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.

2562
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:37,590
No!

2563
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:39,590
That was great.

2564
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:46,090
I just pushed them away.

2565
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:48,790
Alright, guys.

2566
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:51,370
I don't think she's good on defense.

2567
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:52,970
Guys.

2568
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:53,930
I...

2569
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:56,070
The almighty push.

2570
01:32:57,010 --> 01:32:58,190
Yeah, I think...

2571
01:32:58,190 --> 01:33:02,790
She seems like really broken for like overtime pushes.

2572
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:04,850
So I can literally just push her.

2573
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:06,570
Push people off for overtime.

2574
01:33:06,690 --> 01:33:08,150
Wait, I can actually like...

2575
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:09,970
I can just push people off.

2576
01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:13,110
Wait, that's so scary.

2577
01:33:13,210 --> 01:33:15,210
Yeah, I can like push people off during overtime.

2578
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:16,350
I think.

2579
01:33:17,310 --> 01:33:18,170
Oh my god.

2580
01:33:18,330 --> 01:33:18,630
Goodbye.

2581
01:33:21,950 --> 01:33:22,750
Oh my god.

2582
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:23,510
I need to heal.

2583
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:24,370
I don't care.

2584
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:26,070
Okay, I care.

2585
01:33:26,570 --> 01:33:26,930
I...

2586
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:28,590
I care.

2587
01:33:29,790 --> 01:33:30,970
Oh no.

2588
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:32,070
Oh no.

2589
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:33,790
Guys, live.

2590
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:35,230
Live.

2591
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:36,770
I care.

2592
01:33:38,570 --> 01:33:39,530
Oh my god.

2593
01:33:39,630 --> 01:33:40,110
Live.

2594
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:41,630
Please.

2595
01:33:41,730 --> 01:33:42,550
I'll start pushing.

2596
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:46,210
And then I started pushing.

2597
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:49,870
It's okay.

2598
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:51,150
It's okay.

2599
01:33:51,410 --> 01:33:52,590
They're all in the line.

2600
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:55,450
It's good.

2601
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:56,490
They're all in the line.

2602
01:33:58,570 --> 01:33:59,110
Stack up.

2603
01:33:59,290 --> 01:33:59,670
Stack up.

2604
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:00,230
Stack up.

2605
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:00,930
Stack up.

2606
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:01,730
Please.

2607
01:34:02,690 --> 01:34:03,570
Stack up.

2608
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:05,910
Disappear.

2609
01:34:06,050 --> 01:34:07,950
Don't let him do anything to you.

2610
01:34:10,330 --> 01:34:10,770
Nice.

2611
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:11,770
I don't know.

2612
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:13,990
I think that might have been too...

2613
01:34:13,990 --> 01:34:16,070
That ult might have been a little bit too much.

2614
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:16,730
Not gonna lie.

2615
01:34:17,130 --> 01:34:20,930
I don't think I needed that ult.

2616
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:22,170
See, go fight.

2617
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:23,190
Line up, everybody.

2618
01:34:23,330 --> 01:34:24,110
Hold hands.

2619
01:34:24,110 --> 01:34:26,290
I need you all to line up.

2620
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:27,030
Right now.

2621
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:29,190
Okay, if we lose this point, I'm going Luna.

2622
01:34:29,690 --> 01:34:31,210
I legitimately don't think this is a...

2623
01:34:31,210 --> 01:34:32,090
I don't...

2624
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:33,890
I legitimately think this team needs Nula.

2625
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:38,290
We definitely need Luna here.

2626
01:34:45,870 --> 01:34:46,830
Oh no.

2627
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:48,670
Oh no, what do I do?

2628
01:34:49,590 --> 01:34:50,390
Oh no.

2629
01:34:51,130 --> 01:34:51,850
Oh no.

2630
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:53,230
Where did he go?

2631
01:34:54,110 --> 01:34:55,130
Where did he go?

2632
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:56,610
Where did he...

2633
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:57,330
Disappear.

2634
01:34:58,830 --> 01:34:59,530
What?

2635
01:34:59,890 --> 01:35:00,470
Oh my god.

2636
01:35:00,510 --> 01:35:01,630
Okay, I thought he was...

2637
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:03,110
Okay, I thought...

2638
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:05,750
Get away.

2639
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:06,750
Get away.

2640
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:08,550
He's dead, but...

2641
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:10,530
It's the thought that counts, you know?

2642
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:12,400
He still died.

2643
01:35:13,310 --> 01:35:13,990
But...

2644
01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:15,770
It's the thought that counts.

2645
01:35:17,910 --> 01:35:19,370
I did my best.

2646
01:35:19,870 --> 01:35:20,830
I actually...

2647
01:35:20,830 --> 01:35:21,990
I survived.

2648
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:24,430
As long as I survived.

2649
01:35:24,990 --> 01:35:27,070
Oh, I need to be invisible.

2650
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:28,810
One, two...

2651
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:29,290
There we go.

2652
01:35:29,470 --> 01:35:30,430
I have self-heal now.

2653
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:35,630
Sorry, I had to heal myself before I cared about you.

2654
01:35:37,990 --> 01:35:38,990
I had to...

2655
01:35:39,790 --> 01:35:42,110
I need to make sure not to, like, use my...

2656
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:44,350
Okay.

2657
01:35:45,330 --> 01:35:47,130
I need to make sure I don't, like...

2658
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:48,490
Disappear!

2659
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:50,670
That's right!

2660
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:52,390
Please, please don't let me...

2661
01:35:52,390 --> 01:35:53,610
Please, I need to be inside.

2662
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:55,330
I need to be inside.

2663
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:56,710
Nice.

2664
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:00,530
Easy.

2665
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:02,870
So easy.

2666
01:36:04,370 --> 01:36:04,970
Disappear.

2667
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:07,530
I told you, don't fear.

2668
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:11,490
Yeah, but I have a cooldown for it, too.

2669
01:36:12,650 --> 01:36:14,750
I have a cooldown for my...

2670
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:15,930
For my jumps.

2671
01:36:17,870 --> 01:36:19,430
Yeah, it's more for healing.

2672
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:20,870
I'm not actually healing.

2673
01:36:21,090 --> 01:36:23,810
I need a rubber to, like, cancel my shield sometimes, too.

2674
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:24,690
Watch this.

2675
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:30,650
I love just...

2676
01:36:30,650 --> 01:36:31,290
Pushing.

2677
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:35,310
That's a cute run.

2678
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:36,650
Get pushed!

2679
01:36:37,170 --> 01:36:38,230
Get pushed!

2680
01:36:41,630 --> 01:36:42,810
That's a fucking run.

2681
01:36:43,370 --> 01:36:44,830
Wait, are you okay over there?

2682
01:36:45,010 --> 01:36:45,910
Who's in there?

2683
01:36:46,450 --> 01:36:48,430
What the fuck is that knockback?

2684
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:50,730
Get pushed.

2685
01:36:50,970 --> 01:36:52,510
Get fucking pushed.

2686
01:36:55,770 --> 01:36:57,130
Imagine pushing.

2687
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:58,050
That's right.

2688
01:36:58,270 --> 01:36:59,030
Fuck you, Munich.

2689
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:03,050
New season.

2690
01:37:03,550 --> 01:37:04,390
Save me.

2691
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:06,510
Now, where am I?

2692
01:37:07,330 --> 01:37:08,930
What if I just push him?

2693
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:14,250
Oh, fuck!

2694
01:37:14,690 --> 01:37:15,610
Oh, shit!

2695
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:16,070
Bitch!

2696
01:37:18,730 --> 01:37:19,610
I'm sorry!

2697
01:37:19,870 --> 01:37:21,550
Oh my god, I can't push him!

2698
01:37:21,610 --> 01:37:22,390
I'm so sorry!

2699
01:37:30,270 --> 01:37:32,610
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

2700
01:37:33,230 --> 01:37:35,070
I didn't mean it.

2701
01:37:37,450 --> 01:37:37,890
Karma.

2702
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:39,450
Oh, if I...

2703
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:40,790
Oh, if I shoot the Wahi on myself.

2704
01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:41,490
Wait, that's smart.

2705
01:37:41,550 --> 01:37:42,270
That's a good tech.

2706
01:37:43,690 --> 01:37:44,130
Nice.

2707
01:37:45,130 --> 01:37:45,730
Easy.

2708
01:37:49,190 --> 01:37:50,390
Easy.

2709
01:37:53,470 --> 01:37:55,230
Easiest game of my life.

2710
01:38:00,050 --> 01:38:03,190
Oh my god, it's me!

2711
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:05,810
My first match!

2712
01:38:08,030 --> 01:38:09,710
My first match!

2713
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:10,870
Yay!

2714
01:38:10,870 --> 01:38:11,410
Yay!

2715
01:38:12,770 --> 01:38:14,790
I got MVP on my first game!

2716
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:16,430
Alright, my LG.

2717
01:38:17,210 --> 01:38:18,470
I'll do one more game.

2718
01:38:20,950 --> 01:38:21,390
Yay!

2719
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:24,390
How many times must we teach you, Doki?

2720
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:27,030
Thank you for the super chat.

2721
01:38:27,170 --> 01:38:27,710
Super thank you.

2722
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:28,250
Thank you.

2723
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:30,390

01:38:30,510 --> 01:38:30,650
Thank you.

2725
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:30,870
Thank you.

2726
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:32,810
Get you some oven-baked chicken wings.

2727
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:34,370
Thank you for the super chat, Alex.

2728
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:35,630
I haven't had dinner yet.

2729
01:38:35,770 --> 01:38:39,030
Like, I basically just ate some snacks and everything.

2730
01:38:39,910 --> 01:38:43,990
And so, like, after this, I'm going to make some Buldak noodles after.

2731
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:45,690
So, I'm super excited.

2732
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:49,330
So, yay!

2733
01:38:50,110 --> 01:38:54,290
I'm super excited to make some Buldak noodles after stream.

2734
01:38:57,210 --> 01:38:57,510
Alright.

2735
01:38:57,870 --> 01:38:58,930
Oh, the queue is taking a while.

2736
01:38:59,030 --> 01:38:59,910
I didn't expect it.

2737
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:00,650
Where is everybody?

2738
01:39:01,090 --> 01:39:02,730
It's 2 in the morning.

2739
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:06,210
It's prime gamer hours.

2740
01:39:08,410 --> 01:39:10,650
How the... wait, is that... that's plat.

2741
01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:11,010
Okay.

2742
01:39:11,790 --> 01:39:13,610
Is that a plat one?

2743
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:14,530
Oh, my God.

2744
01:39:14,550 --> 01:39:16,310
People are like Diamond 3 right now.

2745
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:16,770
That's crazy.

2746
01:39:16,890 --> 01:39:17,810
Oh, I'm going to be Diamond...

2747
01:39:17,810 --> 01:39:20,450
Wait, if I win my next game, I can be Diamond 3.

2748
01:39:21,890 --> 01:39:23,450
Just like all of these guys.

2749
01:39:25,450 --> 01:39:27,830
It's prime hours right now, everyone.

2750
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:31,650
It's literally gamer hours.

2751
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:37,210
Oh, my God.

2752
01:39:37,230 --> 01:39:37,810
This is it.

2753
01:39:37,810 --> 01:39:38,890
We're going to do it.

2754
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:40,550
It has begun.

2755
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:44,790
Alright, this is going to be my LG and then we're going to call it here.

2756
01:39:47,450 --> 01:39:48,590
Smitty, thank you for the super chat.

2757
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:48,890
Thank you.

2758
01:39:48,910 --> 01:39:49,210
Thank you.

2759
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:54,130
Why do they call an oven when you're in the cold food of hot eat the food?

2760
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:54,710
Huh?

2761
01:39:55,090 --> 01:39:56,030
Okay, now I'm just going to...

2762
01:39:56,030 --> 01:39:56,590
I'm going to play Luna.

2763
01:39:57,770 --> 01:39:59,130
I'm going to play Luna now.

2764
01:39:59,230 --> 01:39:59,810
I don't know.

2765
01:39:59,850 --> 01:40:00,970
I don't know if like...

2766
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:05,090
I don't know if like...

2767
01:40:05,790 --> 01:40:06,510
If like...

2768
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:09,950
If like...

2769
01:40:09,950 --> 01:40:13,590
Invisible woman is actually like good.

2770
01:40:13,950 --> 01:40:15,550
I can't tell.

2771
01:40:16,150 --> 01:40:18,910
I feel like I'm just fucking around on it.

2772
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:19,890
I don't know.

2773
01:40:20,050 --> 01:40:21,950
I don't know if she's better than Luna or not.

2774
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:25,050
I feel like Luna's ult is definitely better.

2775
01:40:28,630 --> 01:40:34,570
I have no idea.

2776
01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:37,030
Wait, it's Dr. Uno?

2777
01:40:37,030 --> 01:40:37,690
Oh, yeah.

2778
01:40:37,890 --> 01:40:38,370
Yes.

2779
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:42,790
Don't think she can do better, but she...

2780
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:43,430
I'm going to try.

2781
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:45,230
If I win this, I get diamond.

2782
01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:47,430
So, I'm fucking trying my fucking heart out.

2783
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:49,650
I want diamond.

2784
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:52,530
Oh my god, Toe Grabber 235.

2785
01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:53,170
That's mine.

2786
01:40:55,470 --> 01:40:58,050
It's Toe Grabber 235.

2787
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:05,650
No, guys.

2788
01:41:05,650 --> 01:41:06,770
No, no, no, no.

2789
01:41:06,890 --> 01:41:07,810
We're gonna do this.

2790
01:41:07,930 --> 01:41:09,030
This is gonna work.

2791
01:41:09,170 --> 01:41:09,650
I'm literally...

2792
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:11,970
I'm literally on...

2793
01:41:11,970 --> 01:41:13,410
Or do I put it on Mr. Fantastic?

2794
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:15,490
Cause he's like basically a third tank.

2795
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:16,150
Isn't he?

2796
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:19,310
Isn't he like a third tank?

2797
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:22,790
Alright, here we go.

2798
01:41:23,570 --> 01:41:24,770
Oh my god, people in this chat...

2799
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:27,590
Oh my god.

2800
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:28,910
What?

2801
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:29,690
Oh, no.

2802
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:30,690
They have Wolverine.

2803
01:41:30,910 --> 01:41:32,770
And we can't ban him.

2804
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:38,410
They have...

2805
01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:39,130
Oh, no.

2806
01:41:39,450 --> 01:41:40,550
Oh, no.

2807
01:41:40,890 --> 01:41:42,630
They have Wolverine.

2808
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:44,530
What do we do?

2809
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:51,030
Oh, no.

2810
01:41:52,170 --> 01:41:53,150
Oh, no.

2811
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:54,870
He's gonna be free.

2812
01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:56,430
In flat.

2813
01:41:58,090 --> 01:41:58,930
Jesus Christ.

2814
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:00,850
Guys, I don't think I'm winning this.

2815
01:42:01,170 --> 01:42:02,970
Guys, I don't think I'm winning.

2816
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:03,990
Very nice.

2817
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:05,490
Magic, magic.

2818
01:42:06,710 --> 01:42:07,850
Oh my god.

2819
01:42:08,030 --> 01:42:10,210
Oh my god.

2820
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:14,610
What do I do?

2821
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:16,630
What do I do?

2822
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:17,350
Okay.

2823
01:42:17,890 --> 01:42:19,250
Okay, maybe I...

2824
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:19,810
I don't know.

2825
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:23,250
Maybe I should have played Mr. Fantastic here.

2826
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:24,030
Please.

2827
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:25,990
Please let me through.

2828
01:42:26,190 --> 01:42:27,890
Just let us through.

2829
01:42:29,850 --> 01:42:31,450
He can't even...

2830
01:42:33,990 --> 01:42:34,430
Oh, no.

2831
01:42:35,710 --> 01:42:36,510
Okay.

2832
01:42:38,650 --> 01:42:39,450
Guys.

2833
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:41,950
Guys, I don't know now.

2834
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:43,990
Guys, if it's...

2835
01:42:44,890 --> 01:42:47,990
Guys, this doesn't seem very...

2836
01:42:48,570 --> 01:42:50,770
Oh my god.

2837
01:42:51,890 --> 01:42:53,510
I'm very worried.

2838
01:42:55,610 --> 01:42:57,810
Guys, I don't think I'm winning this.

2839
01:42:58,190 --> 01:42:58,910
I...

2840
01:42:58,910 --> 01:43:00,170
You know what that means.

2841
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:01,750
It's time.

2842
01:43:04,070 --> 01:43:05,430
It's time.

2843
01:43:05,810 --> 01:43:08,370
Guys, you know what that means.

2844
01:43:09,030 --> 01:43:11,890
I'm ready to carry this team.

2845
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:16,270
It's not throwing.

2846
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:17,630
It's not...

2847
01:43:17,630 --> 01:43:18,890
They're literally...

2848
01:43:18,890 --> 01:43:20,750
They're grouped up.

2849
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:22,130
Guys.

2850
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:26,570
I can push him away.

2851
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:27,750
I can't push him away.

2852
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:28,630
I can't...

2853
01:43:28,630 --> 01:43:29,890
I can't push him away.

2854
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:31,750
I can't push him away.

2855
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:37,270
Guys.

2856
01:43:37,430 --> 01:43:38,830
I don't know.

2857
01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:40,030
Guys.

2858
01:43:40,930 --> 01:43:41,470
This...

2859
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:43,110
This...

2860
01:43:43,110 --> 01:43:45,750
This doesn't look ideal right now.

2861
01:43:48,350 --> 01:43:49,750
We need high damage characters.

2862
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:53,330
Okay.

2863
01:43:55,310 --> 01:43:55,810
Okay, yeah.

2864
01:43:55,950 --> 01:43:56,530
That works.

2865
01:43:56,830 --> 01:43:57,570
Oh my god.

2866
01:43:57,950 --> 01:43:58,770
It's okay.

2867
01:43:58,930 --> 01:44:00,110
I'm Miss Fantastic now.

2868
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:01,210
It's okay.

2869
01:44:01,310 --> 01:44:01,970
We got this.

2870
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:03,470
We need a lot of damage.

2871
01:44:03,730 --> 01:44:03,970
We got this.

2872
01:44:03,970 --> 01:44:04,830
We got this, guys.

2873
01:44:06,590 --> 01:44:07,390
I'm literally...

2874
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:08,930
It's okay.

2875
01:44:09,030 --> 01:44:09,790
We got the team up.

2876
01:44:13,950 --> 01:44:14,970
We got it.

2877
01:44:16,110 --> 01:44:16,790
We got it.

2878
01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:17,810
Okay, guys.

2879
01:44:17,910 --> 01:44:18,930
Maybe we don't get diamond.

2880
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:19,350
Wait.

2881
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:20,230
Maybe we can.

2882
01:44:20,370 --> 01:44:20,490
No.

2883
01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:21,590
We'll get diamond.

2884
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:23,790
We'll end when we get diamond, guys.

2885
01:44:23,910 --> 01:44:25,410
We're gonna...

2886
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:28,510
We'll end the stream when we get diamond.

2887
01:44:28,870 --> 01:44:29,370
Let's go.

2888
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:31,090
It can't be that bad.

2889
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:32,270
I just need to win one game.

2890
01:44:32,670 --> 01:44:33,010
Guys.

2891
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:34,450
I literally just need to win...

2892
01:44:34,450 --> 01:44:36,790
I just need to win one...

2893
01:44:36,790 --> 01:44:38,590
I need to win one game.

2894
01:44:39,950 --> 01:44:41,890
Guys, it's gonna be okay.

2895
01:44:42,490 --> 01:44:44,450
I just need to win one game.

2896
01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:46,730
Let's go.

2897
01:44:48,990 --> 01:44:49,710
Wait, what?

2898
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:52,950
Yeah.

2899
01:44:54,610 --> 01:44:55,870
It's just one win.

2900
01:44:56,450 --> 01:44:57,210
It's just one win.

2901
01:45:03,650 --> 01:45:04,290
We're done.

2902
01:45:05,110 --> 01:45:05,810
It's alright.

2903
01:45:06,130 --> 01:45:06,410
It's fine.

2904
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:07,610
Guys, don't listen to him.

2905
01:45:07,670 --> 01:45:08,770
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

2906
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:10,930
Don't worry.

2907
01:45:11,010 --> 01:45:12,890
I pushed, but then he walled him off.

2908
01:45:12,910 --> 01:45:13,350
It's okay.

2909
01:45:14,610 --> 01:45:16,190
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

2910
01:45:16,230 --> 01:45:16,930
Don't listen to him.

2911
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:18,210
Guys, don't listen to him.

2912
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:18,570
He's not...

2913
01:45:18,570 --> 01:45:19,430
He's a fucking fleshy.

2914
01:45:19,770 --> 01:45:24,330
Don't listen to him.

2915
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:26,710
Don't worry.

2916
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:28,150
He's so dead.

2917
01:45:29,390 --> 01:45:29,830
He's...

2918
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:31,630
I'm dead!

2919
01:45:32,070 --> 01:45:32,770
Am I okay?

2920
01:45:37,230 --> 01:45:38,010
It's okay.

2921
01:45:38,770 --> 01:45:39,430
It's alright.

2922
01:45:39,510 --> 01:45:40,250
We'll be fine.

2923
01:45:41,390 --> 01:45:42,090
We'll be fine.

2924
01:45:42,190 --> 01:45:43,090
Don't listen to him.

2925
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:44,930
He doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.

2926
01:45:45,550 --> 01:45:46,530
It's just one win.

2927
01:45:47,950 --> 01:45:49,070
Yeah, that's right.

2928
01:45:49,230 --> 01:45:51,710
And we can't do anything about it until I'm in diamonds.

2929
01:45:52,510 --> 01:45:53,330
I need...

2930
01:45:53,330 --> 01:45:55,330
I need to get out of plat, guys.

2931
01:45:55,610 --> 01:45:56,390
I can't really walk through.

2932
01:45:58,550 --> 01:46:01,390
Guys, I need to get out of plat so I...

2933
01:46:01,630 --> 01:46:02,310
Shit.

2934
01:46:04,770 --> 01:46:05,630
Oh my god.

2935
01:46:05,810 --> 01:46:06,290
Get out!

2936
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:07,670
That's right.

2937
01:46:09,190 --> 01:46:10,270
He feels fantastic.

2938
01:46:10,570 --> 01:46:12,730
Okay, I don't know what to do here.

2939
01:46:13,930 --> 01:46:14,190
Alright.

2940
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:17,230
Disappear!

2941
01:46:17,370 --> 01:46:17,730
That's it!

2942
01:46:17,930 --> 01:46:18,550
Right here!

2943
01:46:19,030 --> 01:46:20,030
They're gonna disappear!

2944
01:46:22,450 --> 01:46:23,430
Oh my god.

2945
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:24,670
He doesn't know I'm here, right?

2946
01:46:24,870 --> 01:46:25,010
No!

2947
01:46:25,290 --> 01:46:26,090
He does!

2948
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:27,450
No!

2949
01:46:28,950 --> 01:46:29,570
I got you.

2950
01:46:29,730 --> 01:46:30,250
I got you.

2951
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:33,130
No, I didn't disappear.

2952
01:46:33,650 --> 01:46:35,310
I didn't disappear.

2953
01:46:37,410 --> 01:46:38,990
I need to get out of plat.

2954
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:39,710
I can't.

2955
01:46:39,730 --> 01:46:42,050
I need my bands again, guys.

2956
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:43,350
I can't.

2957
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:46,890
Get me out of this wild circ...

2958
01:46:46,890 --> 01:46:49,870
This wild zoo where everything is playable.

2959
01:46:50,710 --> 01:46:52,550
Get me out of here.

2960
01:46:52,830 --> 01:46:53,990
Get me out.

2961
01:46:55,270 --> 01:46:56,770
Wait a minute.

2962
01:46:57,510 --> 01:47:02,010
I need it so that I can have my bands again.

2963
01:47:02,170 --> 01:47:03,250
I can't.

2964
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:07,670
I'm not strong enough to go through this wild ride.

2965
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:09,650
Oh, I need...

2966
01:47:09,650 --> 01:47:10,770
I should have pulled him.

2967
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:13,110
I need...

2968
01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:14,990
What the fuck?!

2969
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:20,210
Is she gonna be okay?

2970
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:22,210
Is she gonna be okay?

2971
01:47:22,210 --> 01:47:24,090
Am I gonna be okay?

2972
01:47:28,030 --> 01:47:29,350
Guys, I don't think...

2973
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:29,870
I pushed him.

2974
01:47:30,010 --> 01:47:30,690
I pushed him.

2975
01:47:30,890 --> 01:47:31,710
I pushed him.

2976
01:47:39,110 --> 01:47:40,350
It's okay, guys.

2977
01:47:40,630 --> 01:47:42,230
We lose less in plat.

2978
01:47:42,350 --> 01:47:43,050
It's okay.

2979
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:46,490
We lose less in plat, guys.

2980
01:47:46,590 --> 01:47:49,430
It's not like the high elos.

2981
01:47:49,990 --> 01:47:51,610
Everything will be fine.

2982
01:47:52,910 --> 01:47:55,170
It'll all be fine, guys.

2983
01:47:55,690 --> 01:47:57,350
Cause I can push him away.

2984
01:47:57,510 --> 01:47:58,210
Look at that.

2985
01:47:58,810 --> 01:47:59,710
Look at that.

2986
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:01,630
That's when you know I'm a gamer.

2987
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:04,350
That's when you know.

2988
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:07,630
Guys, cause I can just push him away.

2989
01:48:07,790 --> 01:48:08,990
Oh, it's alright.

2990
01:48:09,130 --> 01:48:09,630
That's fine.

2991
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:12,090
You don't need me right now.

2992
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:12,990
That's fine.

2993
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:15,630
Don't worry.

2994
01:48:15,870 --> 01:48:17,670
She won't know that I couldn't kill her.

2995
01:48:17,910 --> 01:48:19,530
She won't know that I missed.

2996
01:48:20,410 --> 01:48:21,090
It's okay.

2997
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:25,470
I'm literally as MissFantastic just so I can give a team up.

2998
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:27,530
That's okay.

2999
01:48:27,590 --> 01:48:28,350
They don't know.

3000
01:48:30,590 --> 01:48:31,730
They don't know.

3001
01:48:33,290 --> 01:48:34,910
Wait, what's going on?

3002
01:48:35,110 --> 01:48:35,610
Oh my...

3003
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:40,520
Get me out of here.

3004
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:41,780
Get me out of here.

3005
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:42,760
Get me out.

3006
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:43,520
Get me out.

3007
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:44,520
We baited our Magneto.

3008
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:45,380
I'm so sorry.

3009
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:47,400
I'm so sorry.

3010
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:50,320
We baited her.

3011
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:53,740
They don't know.

3012
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:04,360
What's the point?

3013
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:14,400
What's the point of being invisible if she can still see me?

3014
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:17,580
What's the point?

3015
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:23,200
What's the point of being invisible?

3016
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:29,660
Oh my god.

3017
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:32,460
He can see.

3018
01:49:32,820 --> 01:49:35,800
You mean he can just see where I am?

3019
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:36,700
Oh wait, I forgot.

3020
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,100
I shot my hands.

3021
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:41,740
I keep forgetting if I shoot my hands, they can see where I am.

3022
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:42,600
It's okay.

3023
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:44,260
It's okay.

3024
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:45,820
All we need...

3025
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:48,160
I should've went out of the circle afterwards.

3026
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:49,560
You're right.

3027
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:51,800
I should've went out of the circle.

3028
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:53,580
And...

3029
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:53,940
It's alright.

3030
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:55,580
I gained like how many points?

3031
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:57,140
I gained like a lot, right?

3032
01:49:57,720 --> 01:49:59,400
I forgot how much I gained.

3033
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:11,580
I forgot how much I gained for like winning.

3034
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:12,000
33?

3035
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:13,200
Oh, okay.

3036
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:13,920
It's not that bad.

3037
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:14,700
I can get like two.

3038
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:15,760
I just need two wins.

3039
01:50:20,010 --> 01:50:20,950
You get 30?

3040
01:50:21,290 --> 01:50:22,510
Okay, just two wins, guys.

3041
01:50:22,570 --> 01:50:23,330
It's not that bad.

3042
01:50:23,570 --> 01:50:25,950
It's just two wins this time.

3043
01:50:28,510 --> 01:50:29,610
Just two more.

3044
01:50:31,030 --> 01:50:31,610
Just two more.

3045
01:50:31,610 --> 01:50:32,270
Two more wins.

3046
01:50:32,350 --> 01:50:33,450
It can't be that bad.

3047
01:50:33,670 --> 01:50:35,550
It can't be that bad, everyone.

3048
01:50:36,210 --> 01:50:37,510
It's just two wins.

3049
01:50:38,030 --> 01:50:39,310
Guys, just two wins.

3050
01:50:41,450 --> 01:50:43,890
And then I can have hero bands again.

3051
01:50:44,010 --> 01:50:44,770
I can...

3052
01:50:44,770 --> 01:50:45,530
I can...

3053
01:50:45,530 --> 01:50:46,710
I can have hero bands.

3054
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:47,770
Look, see?

3055
01:50:47,890 --> 01:50:48,730
I'll go Luna.

3056
01:50:49,070 --> 01:50:50,190
I'll go Luna.

3057
01:50:50,690 --> 01:50:51,490
And then...

3058
01:50:51,490 --> 01:50:52,970
And then I won't throw.

3059
01:50:53,370 --> 01:50:53,830
I...

3060
01:50:55,950 --> 01:50:58,850
How can I possibly throw when I'm on Luna?

3061
01:50:59,430 --> 01:51:01,370
How can I...

3062
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:06,350
To be fair, I wasn't even throwing as Mrs. Fantastic.

3063
01:51:06,770 --> 01:51:08,110
I was doing so well.

3064
01:51:08,550 --> 01:51:10,390
I was doing so fucking well.

3065
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:18,330
Guys...

3066
01:51:18,330 --> 01:51:19,670
Just two more wins.

3067
01:51:21,110 --> 01:51:23,070
Oh my god, everybody is...

3068
01:51:23,070 --> 01:51:24,190
This is the wild west.

3069
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:25,510
I need to get out of that.

3070
01:51:25,690 --> 01:51:27,110
I need to get out of this fucking circus.

3071
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:28,370
I need...

3072
01:51:28,370 --> 01:51:30,050
I need...

3073
01:51:31,090 --> 01:51:32,090
I need...

3074
01:51:32,090 --> 01:51:34,350
They had a Wolverine and we didn't.

3075
01:51:34,350 --> 01:51:35,810
We all know...

3076
01:51:35,810 --> 01:51:39,590
Honestly, I think Mr. Fantastic is not the best best.

3077
01:51:39,910 --> 01:51:41,350
I think if you run...

3078
01:51:42,770 --> 01:51:44,610
Depends on the comp, I think.

3079
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:49,870
If you have Mr. Fantastic and Wolverine, that shit seems...

3080
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:54,210
As the DPS, that shit seems really scary.

3081
01:52:00,030 --> 01:52:01,770
He seems like a really good dive buster.

3082
01:52:01,890 --> 01:52:02,470
Oh, is he?

3083
01:52:02,730 --> 01:52:03,050
Okay.

3084
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:06,230
Okay, if he's really good at getting rid of dive, then that's...

3085
01:52:10,670 --> 01:52:13,350
Okay, if he's really good at getting rid of dive, that's good.

3086
01:52:13,530 --> 01:52:14,270
That's interesting.

3087
01:52:14,830 --> 01:52:15,850
Sorry, it's Luna hours.

3088
01:52:16,030 --> 01:52:16,470
I need...

3089
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:17,490
I really...

3090
01:52:17,490 --> 01:52:18,430
We need a win.

3091
01:52:20,870 --> 01:52:22,030
Oh my god, he's over.

3092
01:52:22,330 --> 01:52:23,190
He's heading over.

3093
01:52:23,410 --> 01:52:24,690
He's heading over, guys.

3094
01:52:25,390 --> 01:52:25,830
He's...

3095
01:52:27,210 --> 01:52:28,050
Oh no.

3096
01:52:28,490 --> 01:52:29,310
Oh no.

3097
01:52:29,690 --> 01:52:31,030
I saw Mr. Fantastic.

3098
01:52:31,030 --> 01:52:33,550
Mr. Fantastic.

3099
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:34,870
Oh my god.

3100
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:38,430
Guys, I can't believe he picked buff.

3101
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:40,010
Yeah, this character needs a buff.

3102
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:45,250
It's even harder to kill him now.

3103
01:52:48,410 --> 01:52:49,790
Oh my god.

3104
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:52,670
He just menacingly walked over.

3105
01:52:52,750 --> 01:52:53,710
Why don't they give him another buff?

3106
01:52:54,630 --> 01:52:56,510
Oh my god, imagine...

3107
01:52:56,510 --> 01:52:57,790
They just make him like...

3108
01:52:57,790 --> 01:52:59,350
Yo, what's up with that Hella skin, bro?

3109
01:52:59,350 --> 01:53:01,150
Times 10 damage.

3110
01:53:03,130 --> 01:53:03,850
You know what?

3111
01:53:03,890 --> 01:53:04,610
No, you're right.

3112
01:53:05,110 --> 01:53:06,590
He should be even stronger.

3113
01:53:06,770 --> 01:53:07,630
Give him a gun.

3114
01:53:08,290 --> 01:53:13,470
Give him so that his claw shoots bullets.

3115
01:53:14,710 --> 01:53:16,810
Honestly, he's not strong enough.

3116
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:18,350
He should have a gun.

3117
01:53:19,290 --> 01:53:21,590
Every time he claws, bullets come out.

3118
01:53:22,230 --> 01:53:22,870
Oh my god.

3119
01:53:22,950 --> 01:53:23,330
Oh my...

3120
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:23,790
I need a heal.

3121
01:53:23,930 --> 01:53:24,290
I need heals.

3122
01:53:24,530 --> 01:53:25,170
Luna needs heals.

3123
01:53:33,030 --> 01:53:34,330
He even has ult!

3124
01:53:35,770 --> 01:53:36,290
What?!

3125
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:39,000
Yo, this character needs a buff.

3126
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:40,900
Make him have...

3127
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:41,380
You're right.

3128
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:45,200
No, he needs to be shorter so he gets hit less.

3129
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:45,820
Oh, you're right.

3130
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:47,620
Yeah, range bullet.

3131
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:51,700
Range Wolverine, where if Wolverine shoots you, you get kidnapped.

3132
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:52,940
He actually has a 45% win rate.

3133
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:54,080
Yeah, he's way too weak.

3134
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:57,920
He should also have passive.

3135
01:53:58,340 --> 01:53:59,280
You're so right.

3136
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:03,780
Every time he gets shot, he just gets healed like 50%.

3137
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:06,120
I kind of agree with the buff though.

3138
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:08,480
I mean, I have...

3139
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:08,840
What?

3140
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:11,040
I have passive logic and everything on my side.

3141
01:54:11,980 --> 01:54:12,760
Why are they all here?

3142
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:13,940
Oh.

3143
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:17,520
Oh, that would have been a fucking hit right there.

3144
01:54:18,340 --> 01:54:20,460
That should have been a fucking hit.

3145
01:54:23,180 --> 01:54:24,760
They don't see me.

3146
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:25,880
They don't see me.

3147
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:27,840
They don't see me.

3148
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:28,360
They don't see me.

3149
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:31,060
Oh, when I get hit by...

3150
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:32,800
Wait, mine says all person, mean it.

3151
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:34,740
What is this?

3152
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:36,240
What's going on?

3153
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:37,140
What is he...

3154
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:38,220
They're capping.

3155
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:38,700
They're capping.

3156
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:39,580
Oh, shit.

3157
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:40,260
Oh, shit.

3158
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:40,580
Yeah, yeah.

3159
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:41,100
Point, point, point.

3160
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:41,880
C9, C9.

3161
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:48,640
I'm gonna die.

3162
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:50,160
Wow.

3163
01:54:50,620 --> 01:54:51,460
You guys are super fast.

3164
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:52,780
Oh, man.

3165
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:56,440
Guys.

3166
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:01,760
I thought, you know...

3167
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:05,100
I thought we were gonna do Mantis ult first, guys.

3168
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:08,880
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

3169
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:09,660
Wait, touch, touch.

3170
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:10,960
I can ult, I can ult, I can ult.

3171
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:11,280
No!

3172
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:16,800
I was gonna ult point!

3173
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:20,760
That's not necessarily respectable, not using support ults to kind of like even the playing field.

3174
01:55:21,020 --> 01:55:22,240
Since we have, you know...

3175
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:25,160
I thought Mantis ult was ulting first, so I held mine.

3176
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:27,480
Nah, I'm just fucking with you.

3177
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:28,480
I don't feel...

3178
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:33,040
Now we can have survived with just Mantis ult there.

3179
01:55:36,190 --> 01:55:38,160
Cause they had, they had Strangelove.

3180
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:44,660
I just wanna, I'd rather save it for Strangelove.

3181
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:48,020
Oh, my god.

3182
01:55:49,060 --> 01:55:51,280
I would've, I'm saving my...

3183
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:52,420
Oh, shit.

3184
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:54,320
Oh, my god.

3185
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:56,760
I hope they're okay.

3186
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:57,860
I don't know.

3187
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:05,220
Oh, my...

3188
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:06,040
Okay, that's fine.

3189
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:07,080
At least I can use it.

3190
01:56:08,060 --> 01:56:08,380
Alright.

3191
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:10,840
Alright, I got this, I got this.

3192
01:56:11,020 --> 01:56:11,980
Alright, here we go.

3193
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:13,520
They still have Strangelove here.

3194
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:15,860
Oh,

3195
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:23,400
my god.

3196
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:26,200
No!

3197
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:26,360
No!

3198
01:56:28,930 --> 01:56:30,500
Oh, shit, I'm fucking dead.

3199
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:32,340
I'm fucking...

3200
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:33,600
Oh, my god.

3201
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:36,560
Oh, I'm okay.

3202
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:37,600
I'm okay.

3203
01:56:38,140 --> 01:56:39,660
I'm so safe.

3204
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:41,700
I'm so safe.

3205
01:56:46,700 --> 01:56:48,600
I'm so safe.

3206
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,780
I'm so healthy!

3207
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:51,100
I'm so healthy!

3208
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:56,680
Holy shit!

3209
01:56:57,680 --> 01:57:01,080
Anyway, I think they should give Wolverine a gun.

3210
01:57:01,780 --> 01:57:02,920
That's really how I feel.

3211
01:57:03,580 --> 01:57:05,780
I really think...

3212
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:08,240
Man, if only...

3213
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:10,020
He's a little too weak, guys.

3214
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:10,860
If only he...

3215
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:12,780
He's still going?!

3216
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:22,780
He's still...

3217
01:57:22,780 --> 01:57:23,400
Stop!

3218
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,020
Oh, my god!

3219
01:57:25,540 --> 01:57:26,340
Oh, my god!

3220
01:57:26,620 --> 01:57:27,900
No, fear!

3221
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:34,200
Oh, my god!

3222
01:57:34,940 --> 01:57:35,740
Help!

3223
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,440
He's...

3224
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:38,780
Oh, my god!

3225
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,620
Why is it still happening?!

3226
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:45,660
I don't know what that is.

3227
01:57:46,540 --> 01:57:48,920
How is this still going?

3228
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:52,420
It's like they gave him a gun.

3229
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:52,840
Did he say go forward?

3230
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:54,160
Yeah, I saw.

3231
01:57:58,860 --> 01:58:00,240
Oh my god.

3232
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:00,760
Play aggressive here.

3233
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:03,520
I think that's all he's been doing.

3234
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:05,580
What do you mean play aggressive here?

3235
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:08,220
That's all he's been doing this entire time.

3236
01:58:08,220 --> 01:58:11,660
That's all he does.

3237
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:14,220
Oh my god, disappear.

3238
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:15,680
Oh no.

3239
01:58:16,160 --> 01:58:17,180
Oh no.

3240
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:18,620
I don't know what's going on.

3241
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:19,500
I'm putting on a show.

3242
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:20,860
I'm so scared.

3243
01:58:21,140 --> 01:58:22,260
Like, where are we?

3244
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:24,100
Where are we?

3245
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:30,740
Oh my god.

3246
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:32,580
Oh my god.

3247
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:34,820
I got scared about the disappear.

3248
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:36,500
Oh, there we go.

3249
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:38,580
There we go.

3250
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:42,680
She was so happy.

3251
01:58:44,330 --> 01:58:45,100
Here we go.

3252
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:45,660
Nice.

3253
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:51,180
Why am I playing support when I can do that?

3254
01:58:56,720 --> 01:58:58,120
So broken.

3255
01:58:58,620 --> 01:58:59,880
They really...

3256
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:01,140
No, no, no.

3257
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:02,340
They nerfed him, guys.

3258
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:04,880
I feel like he could definitely get stronger.

3259
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:10,480
I feel like he could definitely get a lot stronger.

3260
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:12,540
Yeah, yeah.

3261
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:14,020
No, he needed this, guys.

3262
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:20,240
Do you guys think the ban rate on Wolverine is over or under 85%?

3263
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:21,320
It'll probably be above.

3264
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:22,280
Halos is actually...

3265
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:23,260
I think it might be above.

3266
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:25,720
No, 100%.

3267
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:27,090
I feel like they're gonna ban Wolverine.

3268
01:59:27,680 --> 01:59:30,720
Like, I think Wolverine is gonna replace the Hawkeye buff.

3269
01:59:35,580 --> 01:59:36,700
Definitely.

3270
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:39,720
What?

3271
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:55,440
Oh my god.

3272
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:57,200
How do you...

3273
01:59:57,200 --> 01:59:57,860
You don't.

3274
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:03,260
You don't kill him.

3275
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:05,100
He just lives.

3276
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:10,720
I think he...

3277
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:12,600
I think Wolverine replaces...

3278
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:14,800
I think Wolverine replaces Hawkeye, man.

3279
02:00:15,740 --> 02:00:21,920
Like, who the fuck needs an arrow when you have a giant Canadian man clawing you?

3280
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:28,620
Oh my god, he's going in.

3281
02:00:28,940 --> 02:00:30,260
Oh my god, he's coming in.

3282
02:00:30,380 --> 02:00:31,420
Oh my god.

3283
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:32,620
Oh my god.

3284
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:33,940
He's going crazy.

3285
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,940
He's going fucking crazy.

3286
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:38,620
Oh my god, they went Penny.

3287
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:40,780
They went...

3288
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:42,820
They went Penny.

3289
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:44,400
Oh my god.

3290
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:46,820
They went Penny and...

3291
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:47,800
Holy shit.

3292
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:49,280
And Mr. Fantastic.

3293
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:52,740
But it means nothing.

3294
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:56,800
It means nothing.

3295
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:00,460
Let him have it.

3296
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:02,020
Let him start clawing.

3297
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:05,520
It's a Canadian...

3298
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:08,300
Who is god of hell or a Canadian?

3299
02:01:08,740 --> 02:01:10,680
I heard Canadians go, like, the all-in-one team.

3300
02:01:12,860 --> 02:01:14,580
Yeah, they just need an Amour.

3301
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:18,960
If they have an Amour, maybe they can stop one Canadian man.

3302
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:20,760
Maybe that's all they need.

3303
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:21,840
One Amour.

3304
02:01:24,280 --> 02:01:25,620
Just go full...

3305
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:27,940
Just go full anti-dive.

3306
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:30,920
And then maybe they can stop this Canadian man.

3307
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:34,740
Don't worry.

3308
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:37,460
I will also make sure you live.

3309
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:38,620
I will do it.

3310
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:39,520
You know what?

3311
02:01:39,740 --> 02:01:39,880
Go.

3312
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:41,300
Just kill everything.

3313
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:43,200
I have my Amour.

3314
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:47,360
Just...

3315
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:48,260
Just go.

3316
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:49,780
Just...

3317
02:01:49,780 --> 02:01:50,000
Just...

3318
02:01:50,620 --> 02:01:50,920
Just...

3319
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:52,200
Oh shit.

3320
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:52,740
Okay.

3321
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:54,120
Okay.

3322
02:01:54,900 --> 02:01:57,940
Just walking around with a fucking fat body, bro.

3323
02:01:58,700 --> 02:02:00,360
Just seeing his whole team get destroyed.

3324
02:02:02,620 --> 02:02:03,780
Oh shit!

3325
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:05,600
Oh nice.

3326
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:06,080
Oh.

3327
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:08,680
That was awkward.

3328
02:02:13,140 --> 02:02:14,180
Don't worry.

3329
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:18,900
What is that?

3330
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:21,100
What even was that?

3331
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:24,840
Oh my god.

3332
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:25,740
Oh my god.

3333
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:27,640
Somebody stop this spider.

3334
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:30,160
Somebody stop it.

3335
02:02:31,600 --> 02:02:33,480
Oh, he knows it's over.

3336
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:38,020
He knows it's over.

3337
02:02:39,340 --> 02:02:40,160
It's okay.

3338
02:02:40,220 --> 02:02:40,660
We're fine.

3339
02:02:41,220 --> 02:02:42,760
We're so fine.

3340
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:49,240
Look at that.

3341
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:50,880
So easy.

3342
02:02:54,060 --> 02:02:55,860
It's so cool when what?

3343
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:56,960
When what?

3344
02:02:58,140 --> 02:02:59,340
We'll never know.

3345
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:00,920
How is Storm?

3346
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:02,560
She seems really broken.

3347
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:05,640
But like, it doesn't matter because we have Wolverine.

3348
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:08,480
Like, it doesn't matter.

3349
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:10,960
Because we have this...

3350
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:12,940
We have this Canadian.

3351
02:03:14,930 --> 02:03:15,560
One more.

3352
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:17,780
One more.

3353
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:18,180
Super.

3354
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:19,100
Thank you for the super chat.

3355
02:03:19,180 --> 02:03:19,400
Thank you.

3356
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:19,940
Thank you.

3357
02:03:20,180 --> 02:03:23,480
What's 350 HP buff can do to a Logan?

3358
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:26,960
That and...

3359
02:03:27,860 --> 02:03:30,140
That and the snowflake.

3360
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:34,300
The Luna snowflake seems so fucking crate broken with Wolverine.

3361
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:40,820
And all I have to do is just heal the tank and like, my Wolverine just lives forever.

3362
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:43,040
And that's why I need to get out of this.

3363
02:03:43,340 --> 02:03:47,120
That is exactly why I need to get out of that.

3364
02:03:47,340 --> 02:03:48,460
I need my bans back.

3365
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:48,960
I cannot.

3366
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:50,000
I can't.

3367
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:50,740
Guys, I cannot.

3368
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:51,760
I cannot.

3369
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:54,840
I don't want to be in here any longer.

3370
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:56,700
I need to get out of here.

3371
02:03:56,740 --> 02:03:57,660
I need to...

3372
02:03:57,660 --> 02:03:59,380
I need to get out of...

3373
02:03:59,380 --> 02:04:01,160
I need to get out of here.

3374
02:04:02,860 --> 02:04:04,360
Someone free me.

3375
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:06,880
From this...

3376
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:08,660
This personal hell.

3377
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:13,840
Alright, that's fine.

3378
02:04:15,700 --> 02:04:18,100
We don't need Logan versus Logan.

3379
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:22,900
I only know this play.

3380
02:04:26,890 --> 02:04:28,470
If we win this, we're free.

3381
02:04:29,190 --> 02:04:29,910
We'll be freed.

3382
02:04:32,410 --> 02:04:33,650
He needs your right.

3383
02:04:33,830 --> 02:04:34,710
He needs self heal.

3384
02:04:35,190 --> 02:04:37,290
It's not lore accurate, guys.

3385
02:04:40,810 --> 02:04:45,110
It's actually crazy to think that Wolverine...

3386
02:04:45,110 --> 02:04:47,190
During the first week of season...

3387
02:04:47,190 --> 02:04:49,430
First two weeks of season zero...

3388
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:52,010
Everybody thought he was a fucking troll pick.

3389
02:04:54,450 --> 02:04:56,170
It's actually crazy that...

3390
02:04:56,170 --> 02:04:58,270
And now we all know.

3391
02:04:58,910 --> 02:04:59,330
Now...

3392
02:04:59,990 --> 02:05:00,530
Now...

3393
02:05:00,530 --> 02:05:01,430
Now...

3394
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:03,170
Now we know.

3395
02:05:04,190 --> 02:05:06,390
And then they realize he was busted.

3396
02:05:10,230 --> 02:05:11,450
Did they patch out Lunatec?

3397
02:05:11,550 --> 02:05:11,930
It doesn't...

3398
02:05:11,930 --> 02:05:13,510
Oh, I need to turn off mouse acceleration!

3399
02:05:14,810 --> 02:05:15,470
Where is it?

3400
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:16,710
Guys, where's mouse acceleration?

3401
02:05:18,850 --> 02:05:21,050
Oh no, I have mouse acceleration on.

3402
02:05:21,890 --> 02:05:22,290
Oh!

3403
02:05:27,710 --> 02:05:29,130
Oh, it's off by default.

3404
02:05:29,330 --> 02:05:30,050
Oh, thank god.

3405
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:31,630
Okay, thank god.

3406
02:05:31,670 --> 02:05:32,730
I'm glad it's off by default.

3407
02:05:33,690 --> 02:05:34,390
Because I heard...

3408
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:35,930
Remember, that was one of the newer settings.

3409
02:05:40,330 --> 02:05:40,770
Wait...

3410
02:05:40,770 --> 02:05:42,170
Wait, I think...

3411
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:48,400
Oh my god.

3412
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:50,040
It's okay.

3413
02:05:52,220 --> 02:05:52,840
We're fine.

3414
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:53,940
Everything is fine.

3415
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:56,720
Oh, everything might not be fine.

3416
02:05:59,540 --> 02:06:00,260
It's fine.

3417
02:06:00,340 --> 02:06:01,080
I'll just heal up.

3418
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:03,720
If I heal the Venoms, things will be okay.

3419
02:06:03,860 --> 02:06:04,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

3420
02:06:04,860 --> 02:06:05,780
I didn't know.

3421
02:06:06,020 --> 02:06:07,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

3422
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:07,780
I didn't...

3423
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:09,000
Oh my god!

3424
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:13,120
I forgot how to play with a fucking Venom as a tank!

3425
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:13,780
Because it's...

3426
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:14,980
No, we don't...

3427
02:06:14,980 --> 02:06:16,860
Bro, they're running 2-2!

3428
02:06:17,380 --> 02:06:20,780
They're running an actual tank lineup?

3429
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:22,780
We're in play, buddy.

3430
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:23,840
We're...

3431
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:24,620
We're in...

3432
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:25,920
We're in play.

3433
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:30,320
Oh my god, he pulled me over.

3434
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:31,760
Fucking freaks.

3435
02:06:34,060 --> 02:06:35,440
Okay, this is...

3436
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:36,260
This is rough.

3437
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:38,780
Because...

3438
02:06:38,780 --> 02:06:39,460
Oh no.

3439
02:06:41,740 --> 02:06:44,140
I think that's where my Venom is.

3440
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:50,500
Guys, I don't know.

3441
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:51,420
This...

3442
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:53,900
This doesn't seem ideal.

3443
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:00,700
I thought they nerfed him.

3444
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:01,740
I thought they nerfed him.

3445
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:02,640
What is he doing here?

3446
02:07:02,980 --> 02:07:04,900
What is he doing?

3447
02:07:06,920 --> 02:07:08,680
What is he...

3448
02:07:08,680 --> 02:07:10,520
I thought they nerfed this fucker.

3449
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:13,000
What is this Black Panther doing here?

3450
02:07:14,380 --> 02:07:15,400
Oh no.

3451
02:07:16,380 --> 02:07:17,500
Oh no.

3452
02:07:18,700 --> 02:07:19,080
Guys.

3453
02:07:20,020 --> 02:07:20,760
I feel like...

3454
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:22,940
I don't know if Venom is...

3455
02:07:22,940 --> 02:07:23,660
Is it...

3456
02:07:24,120 --> 02:07:25,220
Oh shit, that's...

3457
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:25,600
Okay.

3458
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:28,200
Everything's gonna change now.

3459
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:31,160
Okay, if I die.

3460
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:33,120
I swear to god, if I die.

3461
02:07:33,380 --> 02:07:34,420
Okay, it's fine.

3462
02:07:35,420 --> 02:07:36,240
What?

3463
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:38,620
Where?

3464
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:39,740
Who?

3465
02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:42,060
I...

3466
02:07:42,060 --> 02:07:42,920
Please.

3467
02:07:43,160 --> 02:07:43,640
I...

3468
02:07:43,640 --> 02:07:45,800
Please, I will...

3469
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:47,760
Please, I can't do...

3470
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:49,820
I can't do anything.

3471
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:51,300
Please.

3472
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:52,200
Please.

3473
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:57,280
Somebody get this Black Panther...

3474
02:07:57,280 --> 02:07:58,000
I'm going lowkey.

3475
02:07:58,080 --> 02:07:59,900
I'm fucking gonna go lowkey if I...

3476
02:07:59,900 --> 02:08:01,160
I swear to god.

3477
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:02,280
I'm gonna...

3478
02:08:02,280 --> 02:08:02,980
Oh...

3479
02:08:02,980 --> 02:08:04,060
My god.

3480
02:08:04,180 --> 02:08:05,380
I swear to god.

3481
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:06,480
I...

3482
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:07,720
I can't.

3483
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:08,320
I can't.

3484
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:08,680
I...

3485
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:09,860
Get this guy out of here.

3486
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:11,620
Get this guy out of my lobby.

3487
02:08:12,120 --> 02:08:14,300
Get him out of my fucking...

3488
02:08:16,100 --> 02:08:16,580
Fucking...

3489
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:21,360
Oh my god.

3490
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:22,320
If you don't kill him.

3491
02:08:22,380 --> 02:08:23,400
I swear to god.

3492
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:24,320
Get him out.

3493
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:26,960
Get this fucking guy out.

3494
02:08:34,420 --> 02:08:35,380
Oh, he's...

3495
02:08:35,380 --> 02:08:35,920
Is he okay?

3496
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:37,260
Oh my god.

3497
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:37,940
Where is he?

3498
02:08:38,640 --> 02:08:39,180
Oh, he's okay.

3499
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:43,120
I'm so scared of this Black Panther.

3500
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:44,220
Like...

3501
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:45,520
I thought they nerfed him.

3502
02:08:45,620 --> 02:08:46,240
What happened?

3503
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:48,000
Was that all a lie?

3504
02:08:52,540 --> 02:08:54,240
That did not feel like a nerf.

3505
02:08:54,920 --> 02:08:55,560
Okay.

3506
02:08:56,220 --> 02:08:56,620
Um...

3507
02:08:56,620 --> 02:08:57,640
I like...

3508
02:08:57,640 --> 02:08:58,920
Healed so much.

3509
02:08:59,140 --> 02:08:59,460
Like...

3510
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:00,920
You cannot blame me for that.

3511
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:07,520
Is he okay over there?

3512
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:10,060
Oh no.

3513
02:09:10,300 --> 02:09:10,940
He's...

3514
02:09:10,940 --> 02:09:11,580
Oh no.

3515
02:09:12,900 --> 02:09:14,260
Oh my god.

3516
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:16,320
Um...

3517
02:09:17,340 --> 02:09:17,920
Um...

3518
02:09:23,160 --> 02:09:24,320
He's just...

3519
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:25,880
Who would be afraid more?

3520
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:27,360
Wakanda.

3521
02:09:28,980 --> 02:09:31,720
Wakanda or a Canadian.

3522
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:33,340
I don't know.

3523
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:34,720
We can make it.

3524
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:35,620
Can we make it?

3525
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:37,800
We can, technically.

3526
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:41,360
Oh no.

3527
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:41,820
I hear him.

3528
02:09:42,020 --> 02:09:42,220
We touch.

3529
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:43,960
I hear him.

3530
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:45,480
I'm scared.

3531
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:47,780
I'm so scared.

3532
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:50,000
Hi.

3533
02:09:50,180 --> 02:09:51,140
Just let me die.

3534
02:09:51,340 --> 02:09:53,000
Just let me fucking die.

3535
02:09:53,100 --> 02:09:53,540
I can't.

3536
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:54,440
I...

3537
02:09:54,440 --> 02:09:55,560
I...

3538
02:09:55,560 --> 02:09:55,880
I...

3539
02:09:55,880 --> 02:09:56,400
I can't.

3540
02:09:58,240 --> 02:09:59,740
I can't live.

3541
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:02,420
I can't live.

3542
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:04,160
I'm not going.

3543
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:04,740
I'm not.

3544
02:10:04,820 --> 02:10:05,160
I'm going.

3545
02:10:06,360 --> 02:10:06,980
I'm not.

3546
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:07,620
I'm not going.

3547
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:08,360
I'm fucking...

3548
02:10:08,360 --> 02:10:09,120
I'm going low-key.

3549
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:10,160
I'm going...

3550
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:10,900
I can't.

3551
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:11,960
I cannot.

3552
02:10:16,620 --> 02:10:17,660
I cannot.

3553
02:10:18,120 --> 02:10:18,600
I cannot.

3554
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:20,840
I cannot play Luna.

3555
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:21,980
It's over.

3556
02:10:22,460 --> 02:10:23,540
I cannot.

3557
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:26,800
I cannot play Luna in this.

3558
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:28,280
What do I do?

3559
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:36,580
At least, like, as low-key...

3560
02:10:36,580 --> 02:10:36,640
Wait.

3561
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:37,440
Hold on.

3562
02:10:39,220 --> 02:10:41,320
As either low-key or...

3563
02:10:42,220 --> 02:10:44,360
I feel like I legitimately cannot live.

3564
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:47,280
I cannot live.

3565
02:10:48,340 --> 02:10:51,280
But if I have Lamp, maybe?

3566
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:55,360
Maybe?

3567
02:10:55,780 --> 02:10:56,580
I don't know.

3568
02:10:57,860 --> 02:10:58,300
Oh, wait.

3569
02:10:58,380 --> 02:10:59,220
Now I have two tanks.

3570
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:01,840
Do I try again?

3571
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:03,220
Guys...

3572
02:11:03,220 --> 02:11:03,980
Okay, I'll try again.

3573
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:06,120
Now that I have two tanks, I'll try again.

3574
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:07,920
But, like, it was not it.

3575
02:11:08,080 --> 02:11:09,980
That was absolutely not it.

3576
02:11:11,140 --> 02:11:12,020
That was...

3577
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:14,320
I felt like...

3578
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:19,040
I felt like I was left to die so many times.

3579
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:20,280
I just...

3580
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:22,960
It was just like, fuck you in general.

3581
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:27,320
But now that I have two tanks, surely...

3582
02:11:29,560 --> 02:11:32,080
Surely things will be different, right?

3583
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:37,080
Surely...

3584
02:11:39,660 --> 02:11:41,480
What do you...

3585
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:45,680
Our Mantis was getting fucking...

3586
02:11:48,740 --> 02:11:49,400
Oh, let me...

3587
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:51,140
My Mantis fucking died.

3588
02:11:55,060 --> 02:11:56,760
Oh my god.

3589
02:11:56,860 --> 02:11:57,480
I...

3590
02:11:57,480 --> 02:11:58,620
What do you want us to do?

3591
02:11:59,060 --> 02:12:00,580
What do you...

3592
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:02,880
Let's go, let's go.

3593
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:04,660
Oh my god.

3594
02:12:06,860 --> 02:12:07,320
Bro.

3595
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:09,440
Our Mantis and I...

3596
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:11,320
They don't care about that support.

3597
02:12:16,240 --> 02:12:16,800
They're like...

3598
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:16,980
Surely...

3599
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:19,600
Surely...

3600
02:12:19,600 --> 02:12:22,080
Supports are getting trapped and they're like, what?

3601
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:23,020
Don't you...

3602
02:12:23,020 --> 02:12:23,460
Look.

3603
02:12:23,780 --> 02:12:24,680
Look at us.

3604
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:29,640
Do you really think we want this to happen to us?

3605
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:30,820
Do you...

3606
02:12:30,820 --> 02:12:31,340
Please, ult.

3607
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:33,180
Oh my god.

3608
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:34,040
Please, okay.

3609
02:12:34,180 --> 02:12:35,980
If you don't want to ult, that's also okay.

3610
02:12:36,120 --> 02:12:36,380
I...

3611
02:12:36,380 --> 02:12:36,940
That's fine.

3612
02:12:38,500 --> 02:12:39,520
It's fine.

3613
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:46,680
It's fine.

3614
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:47,140
Mantis, ult.

3615
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:47,940
Mantis.

3616
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:49,120
Mantis, okay.

3617
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:50,220
Thank you.

3618
02:12:51,180 --> 02:12:52,640
Thank you, Mantis for ulting.

3619
02:12:52,780 --> 02:12:54,040
I really appreciate it.

3620
02:12:54,980 --> 02:12:55,600
I really...

3621
02:12:56,820 --> 02:12:58,420
Oh my god, please.

3622
02:12:58,560 --> 02:12:59,460
I can't.

3623
02:12:59,500 --> 02:13:00,380
I can't.

3624
02:13:00,460 --> 02:13:01,880
I can't.

3625
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:05,740
Holy shit.

3626
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:08,680
It's okay.

3627
02:13:09,960 --> 02:13:10,740
It's okay.

3628
02:13:10,820 --> 02:13:12,840
Yasmin, thank you for the 10 gifted subs.

3629
02:13:12,980 --> 02:13:13,920
Thank you.

3630
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:15,920
Oh, ships, ships.

3631
02:13:16,060 --> 02:13:16,440
Oh my god.

3632
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:18,440
I was on Twitch for so long.

3633
02:13:20,200 --> 02:13:20,660
Alright.

3634
02:13:21,140 --> 02:13:22,060
I'm coming over.

3635
02:13:22,340 --> 02:13:24,120
I'm coming back.

3636
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:30,560
Oh no.

3637
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:31,300
Oh no.

3638
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:32,380
Liv, please.

3639
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:33,420
Please, Liv.

3640
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:34,760
Please.

3641
02:13:36,660 --> 02:13:37,860
Okay, that's fine.

3642
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:39,360
That's fine.

3643
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:40,380
That's fine.

3644
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:41,600
I can just die again.

3645
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:42,160
That's...

3646
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:42,520
Nothing dies.

3647
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:43,460
Nothing fucking dies.

3648
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:44,900
You're doing no damage.

3649
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,100
That's fine.

3650
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:46,960
How is this even possible?

3651
02:13:49,320 --> 02:13:51,040
But the season just started.

3652
02:13:51,260 --> 02:13:52,760
Why are you so angry?

3653
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:54,940
The season...

3654
02:13:54,940 --> 02:13:57,760
The season is just...

3655
02:13:57,760 --> 02:14:00,480
I'm so angry.

3656
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:03,520
The season started three hours ago.

3657
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:05,040
We're not...

3658
02:14:05,900 --> 02:14:06,580
No.

3659
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:07,160
No.

3660
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:07,980
No.

3661
02:14:08,790 --> 02:14:09,640
We're alive.

3662
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:11,040
We're alive.

3663
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:14,880
Oh no, he's over there.

3664
02:14:19,320 --> 02:14:20,960
He's over...

3665
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:21,840
Oh my god.

3666
02:14:21,980 --> 02:14:23,820
Oh my god, he disappeared.

3667
02:14:24,200 --> 02:14:25,060
He disappeared.

3668
02:14:25,540 --> 02:14:26,720
He's disappeared.

3669
02:14:27,400 --> 02:14:28,840
Oh my god.

3670
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:31,580
He disappeared.

3671
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:33,500
Oh my god.

3672
02:14:33,700 --> 02:14:36,520
I think this is actually a team death.

3673
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:37,240
I...

3674
02:14:45,290 --> 02:14:46,680
It's okay, two more games.

3675
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:50,940
That...

3676
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:53,580
That...

3677
02:14:53,580 --> 02:14:56,480
That felt like a huge team death right there.

3678
02:14:56,660 --> 02:15:01,700
That felt like a huge team death.

3679
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:03,360
I don't know.

3680
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:05,590
I'm not quite sure yet, but...

3681
02:15:06,520 --> 02:15:07,780
I felt like...

3682
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:10,720
I felt like that wasn't quite a fair...

3683
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:13,630
Is that what the team felt like last game with my Wolverine?

3684
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:14,610
Is that...

3685
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:15,580
Okay, guys.

3686
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:16,600
Two more games, guys.

3687
02:15:16,780 --> 02:15:17,900
Two more games and we'll be free.

3688
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:19,560
Two more...

3689
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:21,280
Two more games, guys.

3690
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:22,590
And then we'll be...

3691
02:15:24,020 --> 02:15:25,160
We'll be freed.

3692
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:27,340
This is it.

3693
02:15:29,180 --> 02:15:30,920
It'll be fun, I believe.

3694
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:34,400
Two more games.

3695
02:15:36,700 --> 02:15:38,160
We can win two in a row.

3696
02:15:38,440 --> 02:15:39,660
It can't be that bad.

3697
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:41,540
We can win two in a row.

3698
02:15:41,680 --> 02:15:42,520
We can...

3699
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:43,620
We can...

3700
02:15:43,620 --> 02:15:45,000
Guys, and then like...

3701
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,100
And then I'm back to normal.

3702
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:48,100
And then...

3703
02:15:48,100 --> 02:15:50,300
I'll be back to normal, everybody.

3704
02:15:50,940 --> 02:15:51,720
Surely, right?

3705
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:53,600
Right?

3706
02:15:54,060 --> 02:15:55,580
I'll be back to normal after that.

3707
02:15:55,800 --> 02:15:56,720
Oh wait, we got a game.

3708
02:15:56,820 --> 02:15:57,100
Nice.

3709
02:15:58,120 --> 02:15:59,320
I got the bad luck out.

3710
02:15:59,560 --> 02:15:59,800
Yeah.

3711
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:01,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3712
02:16:01,380 --> 02:16:03,640
We got the bad luck out of the way.

3713
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:04,620
We have...

3714
02:16:04,620 --> 02:16:05,080
Look, see?

3715
02:16:05,080 --> 02:16:08,100
We have a fellow Top 500 gamer with me.

3716
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:09,180
Look, see?

3717
02:16:09,340 --> 02:16:10,040
Look at that.

3718
02:16:10,440 --> 02:16:10,640
See?

3719
02:16:10,860 --> 02:16:11,280
He's...

3720
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:13,240
He's there with me right here.

3721
02:16:13,880 --> 02:16:15,240
And then, like...

3722
02:16:16,220 --> 02:16:16,740
Clearly...

3723
02:16:16,740 --> 02:16:18,500
Can't be that all bad.

3724
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:23,120
How can it be that bad?

3725
02:16:26,080 --> 02:16:27,140
No Top 500?

3726
02:16:27,640 --> 02:16:30,260
Well, I'm not gonna aim for Top 500 in Season 1.

3727
02:16:30,420 --> 02:16:33,460
Because now that I know the leaderboards aren't gonna be like...

3728
02:16:33,460 --> 02:16:33,800
Public.

3729
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:34,780
There's no point.

3730
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:35,800
Like, actually...

3731
02:16:39,560 --> 02:16:40,640
There's like...

3732
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:42,660
There's literally no point.

3733
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:44,760
Because like, I...

3734
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:47,220
I would have been more...

3735
02:16:47,570 --> 02:16:49,920
I would have been more motivated if...

3736
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:51,500
If like, you can see the leader...

3737
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:53,080
Yeah, what do I gain from that?

3738
02:16:53,620 --> 02:16:58,440
The only reason I wanted Top 500 was so I could brag about being on the leaderboards.

3739
02:17:00,740 --> 02:17:02,760
How would you look me up?

3740
02:17:02,760 --> 02:17:05,320
How can you look me up, guys?

3741
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:07,620
If I'm not on it?

3742
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:10,100
Where is my clout?

3743
02:17:17,420 --> 02:17:18,000
Like...

3744
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:18,890
The website...

3745
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:24,500
Normal people won't look at the website.

3746
02:17:25,940 --> 02:17:26,880
Wait, are you...

3747
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:27,720
No way.

3748
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,050
Wait, are you trying to say that...

3749
02:17:29,640 --> 02:17:30,800
Wait, Season 1?

3750
02:17:31,180 --> 02:17:32,600
You guys don't know that.

3751
02:17:34,620 --> 02:17:36,080
Season 1 is gonna be registered?

3752
02:17:37,020 --> 02:17:38,260
Wait, you guys don't...

3753
02:17:38,260 --> 02:17:38,440
Wait.

3754
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:39,800
How do you know?

3755
02:17:40,220 --> 02:17:42,560
You could be lying to me right now.

3756
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:44,040
How do you know?

3757
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:44,540
Me?

3758
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:45,960
Yes, you.

3759
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:48,240
I don't know.

3760
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:49,840
Were you in my last game?

3761
02:17:49,980 --> 02:17:50,040
What?

3762
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:51,240
Yeah, it was Magneto.

3763
02:17:52,580 --> 02:17:54,400
Season 1 leaderboard is still pending?

3764
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:54,920
No, I was Magneto.

3765
02:17:55,060 --> 02:17:56,280
You were Wolverine, you dingus.

3766
02:17:56,980 --> 02:17:57,920
We looked at the...

3767
02:17:57,920 --> 02:17:58,780
Wait, are you serious?

3768
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:00,520
Wait, no.

3769
02:18:00,560 --> 02:18:01,400
Don't do this to me.

3770
02:18:01,540 --> 02:18:02,460
No, don't do this.

3771
02:18:02,760 --> 02:18:06,500
I literally killed Bumble all game.

3772
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:09,280
I never used it besides that moment.

3773
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:10,060
Guys, don't...

3774
02:18:10,320 --> 02:18:12,540
Don't do this to me, guys.

3775
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:16,140
Guys, you know I'm easily manipulatable.

3776
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:18,320
It doesn't work.

3777
02:18:19,400 --> 02:18:20,980
Guys, don't do this.

3778
02:18:21,300 --> 02:18:21,920
You know I...

3779
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:22,860
I...

3780
02:18:22,860 --> 02:18:23,900
You know...

3781
02:18:24,540 --> 02:18:28,200
You know I can get baited really easily.

3782
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:29,900
You know that.

3783
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:30,280
You know that.

3784
02:18:31,740 --> 02:18:32,780
It's so...

3785
02:18:32,780 --> 02:18:34,760
Guys, don't...

3786
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:35,400
Don't do that.

3787
02:18:35,460 --> 02:18:37,520
He's like, dude, you guys are not doing any damage.

3788
02:18:37,640 --> 02:18:38,680
Like, this is...

3789
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:39,900
This is so embarrassing and like...

3790
02:18:39,900 --> 02:18:42,960
I solocapped down his mag three times.

3791
02:18:43,520 --> 02:18:45,040
Like, the mag was not doing fuck.

3792
02:18:46,020 --> 02:18:48,340
That's a Pharaoh one-trick from fuck Holmes.

3793
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:51,680
That's a Pharaoh one-trick.

3794
02:18:57,320 --> 02:18:58,080
That's funny.

3795
02:18:58,080 --> 02:18:58,820
That's not right.

3796
02:18:59,180 --> 02:19:00,560
Like, mag is right above you, guys.

3797
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:02,320
Wait, there's an Ironman on me.

3798
02:19:02,380 --> 02:19:03,040
There's an Ironman on me.

3799
02:19:05,300 --> 02:19:06,320
Oh my god.

3800
02:19:06,460 --> 02:19:09,440
Oh my god.

3801
02:19:09,540 --> 02:19:12,100
He just gamma raged me.

3802
02:19:12,720 --> 02:19:13,580
Broke their beacon.

3803
02:19:13,880 --> 02:19:14,660
Oh, he doesn't get res.

3804
02:19:17,260 --> 02:19:18,060
This is...

3805
02:19:18,060 --> 02:19:19,340
Do we not look behind?

3806
02:19:20,300 --> 02:19:21,100
Do we...

3807
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:23,400
Do we just...

3808
02:19:23,400 --> 02:19:26,040
Just like fuck looking behind, I guess?

3809
02:19:26,420 --> 02:19:27,200
Like, you know what?

3810
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:28,620
No, fuck you in particular.

3811
02:19:28,820 --> 02:19:29,160
You know what?

3812
02:19:29,220 --> 02:19:30,480
No, that seems right.

3813
02:19:30,980 --> 02:19:34,600
Wait, if there's no bans, then like...

3814
02:19:34,600 --> 02:19:35,410
Weren't people just...

3815
02:19:39,460 --> 02:19:40,360
I'm scared.

3816
02:19:41,020 --> 02:19:41,800
I'm so scared.

3817
02:19:42,400 --> 02:19:42,760
I'm so...

3818
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:45,020
Please be anyone buddy else but me.

3819
02:19:45,620 --> 02:19:45,960
Please.

3820
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:51,520
Please be anyone else but me.

3821
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:52,400
Please.

3822
02:19:52,620 --> 02:19:53,700
Please leave him alone.

3823
02:19:54,120 --> 02:19:54,400
Please.

3824
02:19:55,180 --> 02:19:56,540
Please leave him alone.

3825
02:19:56,540 --> 02:19:57,680
What are you?

3826
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:00,840
Please leave me alone.

3827
02:20:01,440 --> 02:20:03,320
Please leave me alone.

3828
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:06,000
Is he still behind us?

3829
02:20:09,380 --> 02:20:10,480
Is he still...

3830
02:20:10,480 --> 02:20:12,260
He's still behind us?

3831
02:20:12,340 --> 02:20:13,500
What is he doing?

3832
02:20:17,240 --> 02:20:19,780
The Ironman is still just behind us.

3833
02:20:26,540 --> 02:20:26,900
Wait, hold on.

3834
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:30,120
Oh, it worked.

3835
02:20:30,380 --> 02:20:30,660
It worked.

3836
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:31,660
It worked.

3837
02:20:34,620 --> 02:20:35,420
Ironman's low.

3838
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:37,120
No.

3839
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:38,300
Oh.

3840
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:42,000
Um...

3841
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,500
Get over here, everyone.

3842
02:20:43,740 --> 02:20:44,280
Let's go.

3843
02:20:47,820 --> 02:20:48,380
Let's...

3844
02:20:48,380 --> 02:20:49,000
There we go.

3845
02:20:49,720 --> 02:20:50,520
This Ironman...

3846
02:20:50,520 --> 02:20:52,960
I know that Ironman is still behind us.

3847
02:20:52,980 --> 02:20:53,780
But that's okay.

3848
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:56,220
Who cares about what I think, I guess.

3849
02:20:56,700 --> 02:20:59,700
Oh, no.

3850
02:20:59,940 --> 02:21:00,420
Oh, no.

3851
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:01,300
Where is my...

3852
02:21:01,300 --> 02:21:05,080
Where is he?

3853
02:21:10,880 --> 02:21:13,140
Why is it so loud?

3854
02:21:16,460 --> 02:21:17,080
Please.

3855
02:21:17,440 --> 02:21:18,040
Please.

3856
02:21:18,340 --> 02:21:19,340
Please disappear.

3857
02:21:21,960 --> 02:21:26,860
Guys, I like how...

3858
02:21:26,860 --> 02:21:30,160
I was like, hey guys, what about the Ironman?

3859
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:32,920
And my entire team was like...

3860
02:21:32,920 --> 02:21:34,280
What about the Ironman?

3861
02:21:34,840 --> 02:21:39,200
What about it?

3862
02:21:45,220 --> 02:21:47,700
Just walk forward, Doki.

3863
02:21:48,740 --> 02:21:50,740
Just walk forward.

3864
02:21:55,020 --> 02:21:56,260
Ironman's still behind us.

3865
02:21:57,920 --> 02:21:58,720
Don't shoot.

3866
02:21:58,800 --> 02:21:59,500
Don't shoot.

3867
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:00,820
Don't shoot.

3868
02:22:01,060 --> 02:22:02,020
Oh, no.

3869
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:02,600
I...

3870
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:04,340
We just got fucked.

3871
02:22:06,660 --> 02:22:07,900
Why do I still...

3872
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:10,340
Why do I still like this?

3873
02:22:10,860 --> 02:22:14,680
Bro, this Ironman is sending a giant signal.

3874
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:17,820
And it's like, I'm behind you.

3875
02:22:20,380 --> 02:22:22,860
I think if we lose this fight, you go...

3876
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:24,720
Starlord, I go.

3877
02:22:26,860 --> 02:22:27,460
I'm...

3878
02:22:27,460 --> 02:22:29,680
I'm behind you.

3879
02:22:31,140 --> 02:22:32,720
I have combo, I have combo.

3880
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:35,600
Hit somebody.

3881
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:36,280
Hit anybody.

3882
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:40,720
Oh, my God.

3883
02:22:41,540 --> 02:22:42,840
Oh, they're dead.

3884
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:44,560
Please.

3885
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:46,300
Please be...

3886
02:22:46,300 --> 02:22:46,940
Oh, the fucker.

3887
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:49,180
Ironman's off left.

3888
02:22:49,420 --> 02:22:50,220
Please.

3889
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:53,860
Twitch for...

3890
02:22:53,860 --> 02:22:54,660
Twitch for Starlord.

3891
02:22:57,460 --> 02:23:00,260
That's like the only value I'm gonna get is comboing with you.

3892
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:02,940
Oh, my God.

3893
02:23:04,980 --> 02:23:05,660
Please.

3894
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,260
Oh, we...

3895
02:23:07,860 --> 02:23:08,540
Please.

3896
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:10,320
Somebody get...

3897
02:23:10,320 --> 02:23:11,400
Get him away.

3898
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:13,320
Please.

3899
02:23:16,820 --> 02:23:18,180
Just kill him.

3900
02:23:19,360 --> 02:23:19,960
He's...

3901
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:23,200
He literally is like driving a Ferrari right now.

3902
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:24,820
That's how loud he is.

3903
02:23:26,860 --> 02:23:27,600
He's still behind.

3904
02:23:27,820 --> 02:23:28,580
That's their left.

3905
02:23:34,840 --> 02:23:35,260
Shoot the shield.

3906
02:23:35,360 --> 02:23:35,720
Shoot the shield.

3907
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:36,240
Shoot the shield.

3908
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:36,780
Shoot the shield.

3909
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:39,620
Why is nobody looking at him?

3910
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:40,500
What is...

3911
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:42,100
Starlord, Starlord, Starlord.

3912
02:23:44,580 --> 02:23:45,700
It's okay, right?

3913
02:23:46,220 --> 02:23:46,960
You know what?

3914
02:23:46,980 --> 02:23:48,240
We don't need to look at him.

3915
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:48,920
You're right.

3916
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:53,600
You're right.

3917
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:54,220
We don't...

3918
02:23:54,860 --> 02:23:56,220
We don't need to look at him.

3919
02:23:56,300 --> 02:23:57,260
You're so right.

3920
02:23:57,720 --> 02:23:59,240
Oh, my God.

3921
02:23:59,540 --> 02:24:00,700
Where's my team?

3922
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:01,880
Where's...

3923
02:24:02,260 --> 02:24:02,460
No.

3924
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:04,600
Oh, my God.

3925
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:04,820
No.

3926
02:24:05,980 --> 02:24:06,200
No.

3927
02:24:07,400 --> 02:24:08,860
Oh, my God.

3928
02:24:14,200 --> 02:24:14,960
Disappear!

3929
02:24:17,460 --> 02:24:18,220
Please.

3930
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:22,160
How does this Ironman...

3931
02:24:22,780 --> 02:24:26,220
How is this Ironman getting so much...

3932
02:24:26,220 --> 02:24:28,260
No, my mic should be working.

3933
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:32,460
How is he getting...

3934
02:24:32,460 --> 02:24:33,940
Oh, my God.

3935
02:24:34,260 --> 02:24:35,720
There's an Ironman behind us.

3936
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:37,820
Turning around.

3937
02:24:37,980 --> 02:24:38,440
Turning around.

3938
02:24:42,580 --> 02:24:43,140
Please.

3939
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:45,600
Oh, my God.

3940
02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:47,620
We finally turned around!

3941
02:24:48,220 --> 02:24:49,900
We didn't give in!

3942
02:24:52,620 --> 02:24:53,180
Guys!

3943
02:24:55,540 --> 02:24:55,920
Come on.

3944
02:24:55,940 --> 02:24:56,200
Come back.

3945
02:24:56,260 --> 02:24:56,480
Come back.

3946
02:24:56,560 --> 02:24:56,740
Come back.

3947
02:24:56,840 --> 02:24:57,600
Oh, no.

3948
02:24:58,280 --> 02:24:59,820
Guys, we did it, gamers.

3949
02:25:00,040 --> 02:25:01,100
We fucking turned around.

3950
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:06,580
Ironman behind us again.

3951
02:25:07,880 --> 02:25:08,900
He's one, he's one.

3952
02:25:11,460 --> 02:25:11,960
Oh,

3953
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:15,660
my God.

3954
02:25:15,980 --> 02:25:16,480
Hey, guys.

3955
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:17,220
That's alright.

3956
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:18,260
I killed the Ironman.

3957
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:19,040
That's okay.

3958
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:21,900
That's alright.

3959
02:25:24,060 --> 02:25:24,580
I did it.

3960
02:25:29,660 --> 02:25:30,980
Fuck that one guy.

3961
02:25:34,280 --> 02:25:35,360
Oh, shit.

3962
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:36,640
What happened?

3963
02:25:40,420 --> 02:25:41,840
We did it, guys!

3964
02:25:42,180 --> 02:25:43,580
We turned around!

3965
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:46,280
We did it!

3966
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:51,100
We did it!

3967
02:25:51,380 --> 02:25:53,320
We turned around.

3968
02:25:54,220 --> 02:25:55,060
Alright, Mr. Krabs.

3969
02:25:55,240 --> 02:25:57,340
Look, I'm gonna say something, but you can't judge me.

3970
02:25:57,340 --> 02:25:57,620
Okay.

3971
02:25:59,300 --> 02:26:01,180
I actually prefer the mouse itself.

3972
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:03,100
What?

3973
02:26:05,240 --> 02:26:06,800
We looked up.

3974
02:26:10,980 --> 02:26:11,980
I don't know.

3975
02:26:12,260 --> 02:26:14,080
I don't know if Invisible Woman is that good.

3976
02:26:15,300 --> 02:26:17,040
Even with the team comp.

3977
02:26:18,740 --> 02:26:19,560
I feel like...

3978
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:21,580
I feel like...

3979
02:26:21,580 --> 02:26:22,160
I don't know.

3980
02:26:22,260 --> 02:26:24,740
I feel like she seems very situational.

3981
02:26:24,740 --> 02:26:27,840
Maybe if the team is playing...

3982
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:34,240
If the enemy team is playing very heavy dive, I feel like she's really strong.

3983
02:26:34,260 --> 02:26:35,340
I feel like...

3984
02:26:35,340 --> 02:26:41,860
I feel like Invisible Woman is really good for, like, heavy dive.

3985
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,960
Like, if you're playing against heavy dive comp, because...

3986
02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:46,960
Who the fuck plays fucking Freaks?

3987
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:48,720
This freak right here.

3988
02:26:51,060 --> 02:26:52,080
I don't like mouse itself.

3989
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:57,000
I think for me, it's because I haven't played with mouse excel in so long.

3990
02:26:57,580 --> 02:26:58,940
So, like, I don't like it.

3991
02:27:02,400 --> 02:27:03,480
Alright, this is it, guys.

3992
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:07,300
After this, we just need one game.

3993
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:09,080
And I believe...

3994
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:12,340
I believe it'll be fine.

3995
02:27:18,060 --> 02:27:18,920
Oh, no.

3996
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:21,440
Oh, no.

3997
02:27:22,100 --> 02:27:22,560
No, no.

3998
02:27:22,780 --> 02:27:24,760
I played Overwatch D.Va and Apex the other day.

3999
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:26,100
Wait, Iron Man behind!

4000
02:27:26,180 --> 02:27:26,580
Iron Man behind!

4001
02:27:27,340 --> 02:27:28,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4002
02:27:28,700 --> 02:27:29,860
Oh my god, I hear him.

4003
02:27:31,700 --> 02:27:32,620
Iron Man's still on us.

4004
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:33,240
We're 1 for 1.

4005
02:27:33,260 --> 02:27:34,260
We're 1 for 1 right now.

4006
02:27:34,820 --> 02:27:35,280
2 for 1.

4007
02:27:35,400 --> 02:27:35,760
2 for 1.

4008
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:36,220
We're down.

4009
02:27:39,140 --> 02:27:40,140
Even fight now, Iron Man.

4010
02:27:40,140 --> 02:27:40,820
Oh my god.

4011
02:27:41,540 --> 02:27:42,420
I bubble you, Gomez.

4012
02:27:42,740 --> 02:27:44,020
I need help from... change.

4013
02:27:46,100 --> 02:27:47,420
Oh my god, please.

4014
02:27:48,600 --> 02:27:49,280
Please, please!

4015
02:27:49,280 --> 02:27:49,900
Change, change, change!

4016
02:27:53,010 --> 02:27:54,200
We're so healthy!

4017
02:27:57,500 --> 02:27:59,060
We're so healthy!

4018
02:28:01,420 --> 02:28:03,080
We're so healthy!

4019
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:07,470
Okay, not gonna lie...

4020
02:28:09,820 --> 02:28:12,460
I feel... hearing that fucking Iron Man...

4021
02:28:12,460 --> 02:28:15,280
like, revving up a goddamn Ferrari...

4022
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:16,000
Like...

4023
02:28:18,220 --> 02:28:20,240
That shit is so silly.

4024
02:28:20,740 --> 02:28:22,420
Like, thank fucking god.

4025
02:28:22,980 --> 02:28:24,400
That's right, Tony Stark.

4026
02:28:27,460 --> 02:28:28,820
That's fucking right.

4027
02:28:30,940 --> 02:28:32,260
You deserve that.

4028
02:28:32,740 --> 02:28:34,740
You fucking deserve it, Tony Stark.

4029
02:28:38,440 --> 02:28:39,660
Wait, where is he?

4030
02:28:40,780 --> 02:28:41,640
Oh my god.

4031
02:28:42,020 --> 02:28:43,140
What the fuck is he doing there?

4032
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:44,280
Where is he?

4033
02:28:44,280 --> 02:28:45,600
I'm so scared.

4034
02:28:47,400 --> 02:28:49,620
Where is the...

4035
02:28:49,620 --> 02:28:50,580
Oh no.

4036
02:28:54,020 --> 02:28:54,720
Come on, kill her!

4037
02:28:54,940 --> 02:28:55,240
Kill her!

4038
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:56,080
Oh!

4039
02:28:56,740 --> 02:28:57,800
Oh, but...

4040
02:28:57,800 --> 02:28:58,960
It's me!

4041
02:28:59,240 --> 02:28:59,780
Oh god.

4042
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:02,000
Where's my team?

4043
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:03,960
Where is he?

4044
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:05,420
Where is the...

4045
02:29:05,420 --> 02:29:06,300
Oh, there he is.

4046
02:29:07,840 --> 02:29:09,200
Wait, are you okay?

4047
02:29:09,380 --> 02:29:10,660
You're so okay.

4048
02:29:10,660 --> 02:29:10,760
Okay.

4049
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:18,620
I have to reload.

4050
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:19,860
I have to reload.

4051
02:29:20,200 --> 02:29:20,820
It's okay.

4052
02:29:22,760 --> 02:29:23,400
Oh, it's okay.

4053
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:26,780
Oh my god, I don't feel...

4054
02:29:26,780 --> 02:29:27,800
I don't...

4055
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:29,620
I don't feel okay.

4056
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:33,560
Where's the Iron Man?

4057
02:29:33,860 --> 02:29:34,800
Where did he go?

4058
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:36,660
Wait, can you heal me?

4059
02:29:36,900 --> 02:29:37,300
Heal the Luna?

4060
02:29:38,560 --> 02:29:39,160
Yeah.

4061
02:29:39,160 --> 02:29:40,060
Okay.

4062
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:46,120
Where is the Iron Man?

4063
02:29:46,180 --> 02:29:47,160
I'm so...

4064
02:29:49,260 --> 02:29:51,800
Where did he go?

4065
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:53,600
I don't hear the rev.

4066
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:54,800
Oh, there he is.

4067
02:29:55,120 --> 02:29:56,000
There he is.

4068
02:29:56,220 --> 02:29:57,340
He's revving it up.

4069
02:29:57,800 --> 02:29:59,660
He's revving it up right now.

4070
02:30:01,540 --> 02:30:03,080
He's driving a car.

4071
02:30:09,990 --> 02:30:10,720
Oh no.

4072
02:30:11,380 --> 02:30:12,180
Oh no.

4073
02:30:16,150 --> 02:30:17,280
There's an Iron Man behind!

4074
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:23,740
Where?

4075
02:30:24,540 --> 02:30:25,060
Where?

4076
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:28,760
I got pushed into that.

4077
02:30:32,070 --> 02:30:32,600
No!

4078
02:30:33,020 --> 02:30:33,200
No!

4079
02:30:33,860 --> 02:30:34,680
What?

4080
02:30:35,400 --> 02:30:35,740
What?

4081
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:38,920
I am ready to put on a show!

4082
02:30:38,920 --> 02:30:40,020
Okay, so this is the woman's end.

4083
02:30:40,300 --> 02:30:41,760
The old man ends when she dies.

4084
02:30:42,160 --> 02:30:42,440
That's...

4085
02:30:42,440 --> 02:30:42,540
Okay.

4086
02:30:43,860 --> 02:30:45,280
Oh my god!

4087
02:30:45,420 --> 02:30:47,560
Dude, how did you guys die to the Iron Man?

4088
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:48,800
I ate that shit.

4089
02:30:49,060 --> 02:30:50,040
No, you didn't.

4090
02:30:50,180 --> 02:30:51,200
No, the fuck, you didn't.

4091
02:30:51,320 --> 02:30:53,800
No, you did not.

4092
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:55,840
No, it hit us.

4093
02:30:55,940 --> 02:30:56,940
I watched the...

4094
02:30:57,840 --> 02:31:00,060
It just had to go over like slightly.

4095
02:31:01,100 --> 02:31:01,520
It must have.

4096
02:31:01,800 --> 02:31:02,440
We got him.

4097
02:31:04,080 --> 02:31:05,300
No, it did not.

4098
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:06,680
No, it did not.

4099
02:31:07,440 --> 02:31:09,620
He's like, no, you fucking liar.

4100
02:31:10,020 --> 02:31:10,420
You are...

4101
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:12,420
Behind us again?

4102
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:17,320
No,

4103
02:31:20,580 --> 02:31:21,000
it did not.

4104
02:31:21,160 --> 02:31:22,000
Don't you lie.

4105
02:31:22,360 --> 02:31:23,360
Don't you lie.

4106
02:31:24,840 --> 02:31:25,800
We all...

4107
02:31:25,800 --> 02:31:27,760
We all saw us get...

4108
02:31:28,360 --> 02:31:29,160
Oh, okay.

4109
02:31:29,360 --> 02:31:29,660
It's fine.

4110
02:31:30,240 --> 02:31:31,180
Okay, I missed.

4111
02:31:31,580 --> 02:31:32,520
But he doesn't know that.

4112
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:33,420
He's not...

4113
02:31:33,420 --> 02:31:34,860
It's not like he's gonna look at the replay.

4114
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,060
Alright, guys.

4115
02:31:37,580 --> 02:31:39,160
There's an Iron Man behind us again.

4116
02:31:44,180 --> 02:31:44,900
Oh,

4117
02:31:49,240 --> 02:31:49,400
please.

4118
02:31:50,920 --> 02:31:52,060
Oh, please.

4119
02:31:57,260 --> 02:31:58,520
Please look...

4120
02:31:58,520 --> 02:31:59,380
Look up!

4121
02:32:00,300 --> 02:32:03,640
Do you guys remember how to look up?

4122
02:32:09,740 --> 02:32:11,060
What the fuck?

4123
02:32:11,240 --> 02:32:12,740
They have a Mr. Fantastic now?

4124
02:32:14,160 --> 02:32:14,840
I can bubble you.

4125
02:32:14,980 --> 02:32:15,720
I can bubble you.

4126
02:32:16,240 --> 02:32:16,960
If you peek left.

4127
02:32:18,080 --> 02:32:18,980
There we go.

4128
02:32:22,820 --> 02:32:23,740
Let's go.

4129
02:32:23,860 --> 02:32:26,240
Let's put on a show, everybody.

4130
02:32:27,480 --> 02:32:28,860
Let's do it.

4131
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:31,720
Iron Man is still behind us.

4132
02:32:38,560 --> 02:32:39,020
Haha!

4133
02:32:39,720 --> 02:32:40,200
Haha!

4134
02:32:40,860 --> 02:32:41,640
He's dead.

4135
02:32:44,340 --> 02:32:46,740
That ult is fucking terrible.

4136
02:32:47,320 --> 02:32:47,560
Yeah.

4137
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:48,520
Not gonna lie.

4138
02:32:48,900 --> 02:32:50,300
That's a terrible ult.

4139
02:32:50,960 --> 02:32:51,900
Even though he did it there.

4140
02:32:52,180 --> 02:32:52,480
Haha!

4141
02:32:54,660 --> 02:32:55,580
That was late.

4142
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:57,720
What, when he damages it, you three-shot people.

4143
02:32:58,580 --> 02:32:58,900
Haha!

4144
02:32:59,280 --> 02:32:59,660
Okay.

4145
02:33:01,060 --> 02:33:01,260
Oh!

4146
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:03,520
Oh!

4147
02:33:04,040 --> 02:33:05,040
We have our stun, y'all.

4148
02:33:05,380 --> 02:33:06,940
I will bubble you when you go for it.

4149
02:33:07,780 --> 02:33:08,140
Haha!

4150
02:33:08,820 --> 02:33:10,060
Do anything to let me know.

4151
02:33:12,880 --> 02:33:14,640
Wait, where's my team?

4152
02:33:15,400 --> 02:33:16,940
Where's my team?

4153
02:33:17,260 --> 02:33:18,220
Where is he?

4154
02:33:28,680 --> 02:33:30,660
I'm gonna back off.

4155
02:33:31,060 --> 02:33:31,900
I'm gonna fucking die.

4156
02:33:34,260 --> 02:33:34,640
Oh!

4157
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:35,640
Okay.

4158
02:33:37,300 --> 02:33:37,820
Alright.

4159
02:33:39,500 --> 02:33:40,020
Okay.

4160
02:33:42,280 --> 02:33:42,960
That's fine.

4161
02:33:43,740 --> 02:33:45,780
He's just a happy guy.

4162
02:33:46,280 --> 02:33:47,900
He's just really happy.

4163
02:33:48,240 --> 02:33:49,920
He's just really...

4164
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:51,560
Also, our health is pretty bad.

4165
02:33:51,660 --> 02:33:52,480
Not gonna lie.

4166
02:33:52,840 --> 02:33:55,180
I don't think he realized how low his nerf is.

4167
02:33:55,500 --> 02:33:56,900
Like, what the fuck is he doing?

4168
02:33:57,300 --> 02:33:57,400
Haha!

4169
02:33:58,540 --> 02:34:00,200
He's like, oh man.

4170
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:03,300
Now that there's no bans.

4171
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:05,400
Now I can play OP characters.

4172
02:34:05,940 --> 02:34:06,460
Like...

4173
02:34:06,460 --> 02:34:07,220
Hello!

4174
02:34:09,660 --> 02:34:13,680
But I don't think he knows it's not as good anymore.

4175
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:15,860
I don't think he knows that.

4176
02:34:16,100 --> 02:34:16,720
Oh, there we go.

4177
02:34:16,760 --> 02:34:17,420
Now he does.

4178
02:34:18,020 --> 02:34:19,380
At least he figured it out.

4179
02:34:20,620 --> 02:34:21,740
What the fuck?

4180
02:34:22,940 --> 02:34:24,000
He figured it out, guys.

4181
02:34:24,580 --> 02:34:25,220
We did it.

4182
02:34:26,540 --> 02:34:27,800
He figured it out.

4183
02:34:32,790 --> 02:34:34,550
Don't worry, you have...

4184
02:34:34,550 --> 02:34:35,390
Oh, no.

4185
02:34:36,570 --> 02:34:37,430
Oh, no.

4186
02:34:37,430 --> 02:34:39,990
I can still live for like one more second.

4187
02:34:45,670 --> 02:34:46,470
Are you okay?

4188
02:34:46,970 --> 02:34:48,890
I'm not looking backwards.

4189
02:34:53,390 --> 02:34:53,990
Disappear!

4190
02:34:58,130 --> 02:34:58,730
Disappear!

4191
02:35:00,470 --> 02:35:01,610
I don't know.

4192
02:35:03,250 --> 02:35:05,090
I don't know what's going on.

4193
02:35:06,890 --> 02:35:09,070
Oh my god, I don't know what's going on.

4194
02:35:13,850 --> 02:35:15,670
There's a Hulk on me!

4195
02:35:15,850 --> 02:35:16,390
There's a Hulk on me!

4196
02:35:16,530 --> 02:35:17,470
Oh my god.

4197
02:35:19,250 --> 02:35:19,810
It's okay.

4198
02:35:20,250 --> 02:35:22,190
You know what this means!

4199
02:35:23,730 --> 02:35:26,010
You know what it means, everyone!

4200
02:35:27,250 --> 02:35:28,350
It's time!

4201
02:35:29,570 --> 02:35:30,090
Yay!

4202
02:35:34,650 --> 02:35:35,590
It's okay.

4203
02:35:36,030 --> 02:35:36,490
Get the bubble!

4204
02:35:36,870 --> 02:35:37,490
Get the bubble!

4205
02:35:39,110 --> 02:35:40,370
Jeff, no!

4206
02:35:41,170 --> 02:35:42,490
What did you do?

4207
02:35:43,850 --> 02:35:45,410
Oh my god.

4208
02:35:45,950 --> 02:35:50,170
I swear, this has been the first game I've had where I...

4209
02:35:50,170 --> 02:35:51,270
This is the first game.

4210
02:35:51,990 --> 02:35:55,410
I've never had a game where like...

4211
02:35:55,410 --> 02:35:57,650
Iron Man is like...

4212
02:35:57,650 --> 02:36:01,410
Iron Man makes the sound of a fucking...

4213
02:36:02,830 --> 02:36:04,870
Formula 1 race car.

4214
02:36:05,190 --> 02:36:07,550
And we don't do anything about it.

4215
02:36:11,830 --> 02:36:13,090
I'm like...

4216
02:36:13,090 --> 02:36:14,450
I've never had a...

4217
02:36:14,450 --> 02:36:16,610
He's so loud!

4218
02:36:17,050 --> 02:36:19,810
How are we letting him do this?

4219
02:36:28,870 --> 02:36:32,330
Every other time we were able to shut down...

4220
02:36:32,330 --> 02:36:36,310
Like last season zero, we were able to shut down Iron Man.

4221
02:36:36,490 --> 02:36:38,370
When he doesn't make a single sound.

4222
02:36:38,370 --> 02:36:42,510
But now that he sounds like a fucking goddamn race car.

4223
02:36:42,770 --> 02:36:43,750
Everyone's like...

4224
02:36:44,230 --> 02:36:44,850
Where is he?

4225
02:36:45,390 --> 02:36:49,310
Where is he?

4226
02:36:49,950 --> 02:36:52,530
Who made that sound?

4227
02:36:52,990 --> 02:36:54,150
Who could it be?

4228
02:36:56,950 --> 02:36:59,070
Must have been the wind.

4229
02:37:02,990 --> 02:37:04,590
It's like...

4230
02:37:04,590 --> 02:37:06,090
And everyone's like...

4231
02:37:06,090 --> 02:37:06,390
Where?

4232
02:37:12,770 --> 02:37:13,290
Where?

4233
02:37:13,290 --> 02:37:15,150
He's in the walls.

4234
02:37:18,630 --> 02:37:20,370
Oh, blind and deaf.

4235
02:37:20,470 --> 02:37:21,930
So loud that everyone...

4236
02:37:21,930 --> 02:37:26,370
Yeah, it was so loud that everyone was just deaf at that point.

4237
02:37:33,020 --> 02:37:34,900
I think it's a little weird though.

4238
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:36,500
It's a little weird that...

4239
02:37:36,500 --> 02:37:37,180
I don't know.

4240
02:37:37,340 --> 02:37:39,540
I don't know if he like actually needed that.

4241
02:37:39,540 --> 02:37:40,580
Oh my god.

4242
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:41,860
We forgot to avoid him.

4243
02:37:41,880 --> 02:37:45,580
We forgot to avoid Broski.

4244
02:37:46,120 --> 02:37:49,180
Is that the guy that complained?

4245
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:53,600
Is that the fucking guy that kept bitching?

4246
02:37:53,880 --> 02:37:54,800
Is that him?

4247
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:55,720
That was him, right?

4248
02:37:57,940 --> 02:37:58,800
Oh my god.

4249
02:37:58,860 --> 02:38:00,000
Always so close.

4250
02:38:03,240 --> 02:38:04,260
Is that him?

4251
02:38:05,340 --> 02:38:07,260
Is that the Pharah one trick that kept bitching?

4252
02:38:17,630 --> 02:38:18,770
I'm just scared for it.

4253
02:38:19,450 --> 02:38:20,170
Oh no.

4254
02:38:20,330 --> 02:38:21,690
They have the Kanthar player?

4255
02:38:22,370 --> 02:38:23,090
Oh no.

4256
02:38:24,510 --> 02:38:24,870
No.

4257
02:38:25,370 --> 02:38:25,730
Please.

4258
02:38:25,970 --> 02:38:27,430
Just get me out of the back.

4259
02:38:27,870 --> 02:38:28,010
Please.

4260
02:38:28,010 --> 02:38:28,530
Are you just Kanthar?

4261
02:38:29,090 --> 02:38:29,390
Alright.

4262
02:38:29,490 --> 02:38:30,050
Go on Namor.

4263
02:38:30,310 --> 02:38:31,690
I'm protecting my supports.

4264
02:38:32,030 --> 02:38:32,290
Yeah, no.

4265
02:38:32,550 --> 02:38:33,370
I'm telling you.

4266
02:38:33,490 --> 02:38:35,770
This guy's like the quickest Kanthar I've ever seen.

4267
02:38:35,870 --> 02:38:36,550
I'm playing Storm.

4268
02:38:36,710 --> 02:38:37,350
I counter him.

4269
02:38:38,170 --> 02:38:38,750
How the...

4270
02:38:38,750 --> 02:38:41,170
I mean, we beat him last game, but it's just like he's so good at Kanthar.

4271
02:38:41,470 --> 02:38:41,830
It's crazy.

4272
02:38:41,930 --> 02:38:42,290
I'm scared.

4273
02:38:42,490 --> 02:38:42,870
Oh my god.

4274
02:38:42,890 --> 02:38:43,390
Get me out of here.

4275
02:38:43,490 --> 02:38:46,070
Get me out of...

4276
02:38:46,070 --> 02:38:46,190
Get me out of the plant.

4277
02:38:46,250 --> 02:38:47,250
I need my bands.

4278
02:38:47,350 --> 02:38:48,230
Get me out of plant.

4279
02:38:48,410 --> 02:38:49,230
Get me out of...

4280
02:38:51,470 --> 02:38:52,730
Get me out of here.

4281
02:38:53,030 --> 02:38:54,210
I need my bands.

4282
02:38:54,410 --> 02:38:54,970
I can't.

4283
02:38:59,530 --> 02:39:00,450
Oh, there he is.

4284
02:39:00,550 --> 02:39:01,730
I see him already.

4285
02:39:02,430 --> 02:39:03,830
I already see him.

4286
02:39:05,270 --> 02:39:06,150
Oh no.

4287
02:39:09,990 --> 02:39:10,470
Please.

4288
02:39:14,470 --> 02:39:15,250
Kanthar, Kanthar.

4289
02:39:18,070 --> 02:39:18,550
Please.

4290
02:39:19,250 --> 02:39:19,370
Please.

4291
02:39:19,370 --> 02:39:20,670
I need help, I need help.

4292
02:39:23,550 --> 02:39:24,530
Oh my god.

4293
02:39:26,670 --> 02:39:27,870
Get me out of here.

4294
02:39:28,930 --> 02:39:29,650
Thunder's on us!

4295
02:39:37,020 --> 02:39:38,780
Oh my god, please!

4296
02:39:41,580 --> 02:39:42,180
What?

4297
02:39:44,880 --> 02:39:45,480
What?!

4298
02:39:48,930 --> 02:39:49,530
Please!

4299
02:39:50,590 --> 02:39:52,150
Get him out of here!

4300
02:39:53,190 --> 02:39:54,950
I'm making a comeback.

4301
02:39:55,370 --> 02:39:56,670
Oh my god, please.

4302
02:39:56,810 --> 02:39:58,510
I need my bands.

4303
02:39:58,630 --> 02:39:59,210
I can't.

4304
02:39:59,310 --> 02:40:01,870
I'm not strong enough for this.

4305
02:40:02,790 --> 02:40:05,230
I am ready to put on a show!

4306
02:40:06,550 --> 02:40:07,770
Oh, okay.

4307
02:40:08,470 --> 02:40:09,830
We're invisible now.

4308
02:40:11,410 --> 02:40:12,250
Alright.

4309
02:40:12,770 --> 02:40:13,550
Disappear!

4310
02:40:13,990 --> 02:40:14,530
No.

4311
02:40:15,450 --> 02:40:16,490
We're gonna disappear.

4312
02:40:16,870 --> 02:40:19,030
Oh my god!

4313
02:40:19,350 --> 02:40:21,290
Fear Magneto!

4314
02:40:23,110 --> 02:40:23,890
Please.

4315
02:40:24,270 --> 02:40:25,510
Holy shit.

4316
02:40:26,230 --> 02:40:26,830
I...

4317
02:40:26,830 --> 02:40:28,530
Oh my god.

4318
02:40:30,300 --> 02:40:31,350
Okay, it doesn't matter.

4319
02:40:31,490 --> 02:40:32,680
I did the sickest...

4320
02:40:33,290 --> 02:40:35,510
Oh my god, it doesn't matter.

4321
02:40:35,990 --> 02:40:36,950
It doesn't...

4322
02:40:36,950 --> 02:40:38,430
It doesn't fucking...

4323
02:40:38,430 --> 02:40:40,830
Oh my god, it doesn't...

4324
02:40:40,830 --> 02:40:41,910
It doesn't matter.

4325
02:40:42,050 --> 02:40:43,450
I guess I just die.

4326
02:40:43,830 --> 02:40:44,010
I...

4327
02:40:44,010 --> 02:40:46,590
I guess I just...

4328
02:40:46,590 --> 02:40:47,990
I dodged...

4329
02:40:47,990 --> 02:40:51,630
I dodged everything, but it doesn't matter.

4330
02:40:51,630 --> 02:40:52,550
I...

4331
02:40:54,390 --> 02:40:55,440
I even...

4332
02:40:56,310 --> 02:40:58,970
I thought he got the Storm of Wood.

4333
02:40:59,250 --> 02:41:01,270
I thought he got it.

4334
02:41:05,610 --> 02:41:06,940
Oh, there he is.

4335
02:41:07,700 --> 02:41:09,980
Someone break his legs, like...

4336
02:41:11,460 --> 02:41:13,780
What did they nerf?!

4337
02:41:13,780 --> 02:41:16,020
What did they nerf?!

4338
02:41:16,020 --> 02:41:18,480
I feel like I got lied to.

4339
02:41:23,380 --> 02:41:26,620
I feel like they lied to me.

4340
02:41:26,620 --> 02:41:31,660
They said he was nerfed.

4341
02:41:35,640 --> 02:41:36,840
It's over.

4342
02:41:37,620 --> 02:41:40,260
It was a lie.

4343
02:41:40,700 --> 02:41:42,840
That was a fucking lie.

4344
02:41:46,850 --> 02:41:47,420
Um...

4345
02:41:48,600 --> 02:41:49,740
Um...

4346
02:41:49,740 --> 02:41:51,120
Um...

4347
02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:53,620
I'm guessing where they are right now.

4348
02:42:00,260 --> 02:42:01,460
Oh my god.

4349
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:06,640
Jesus Christ.

4350
02:42:10,770 --> 02:42:13,430
I hope he's okay over there.

4351
02:42:15,170 --> 02:42:15,970
I...

4352
02:42:15,970 --> 02:42:17,790
There we go, he's fine.

4353
02:42:18,190 --> 02:42:19,250
He's fine.

4354
02:42:20,970 --> 02:42:22,630
I feel like I got gaslit.

4355
02:42:22,750 --> 02:42:24,390
I feel like when people were like...

4356
02:42:24,390 --> 02:42:26,450
See, if the guy who was like...

4357
02:42:26,450 --> 02:42:29,530
My buddy is an Iron Fist player and like...

4358
02:42:29,530 --> 02:42:30,590
I'm wondering like...

4359
02:42:30,590 --> 02:42:31,230
What do I play?

4360
02:42:31,370 --> 02:42:32,070
It doesn't matter.

4361
02:42:32,350 --> 02:42:34,270
He might have got his legs broken.

4362
02:42:34,990 --> 02:42:35,550
Like...

4363
02:42:35,550 --> 02:42:36,770
I got lied to.

4364
02:42:36,870 --> 02:42:37,990
I thought he got...

4365
02:42:37,990 --> 02:42:39,230
I thought he got...

4366
02:42:39,230 --> 02:42:39,950
You know...

4367
02:42:39,950 --> 02:42:40,410
Nerfed.

4368
02:42:40,550 --> 02:42:41,350
Or whatever.

4369
02:42:41,790 --> 02:42:42,930
But clearly...

4370
02:42:42,930 --> 02:42:44,170
Clearly, that's a lie.

4371
02:42:44,250 --> 02:42:46,630
Even in nerf form, he could do all that.

4372
02:42:46,930 --> 02:42:47,810
Like, what...

4373
02:42:48,690 --> 02:42:49,310
Like...

4374
02:42:51,710 --> 02:42:53,090
That's so fucked.

4375
02:42:54,590 --> 02:42:56,550
That's actually so fucked.

4376
02:42:56,850 --> 02:42:57,910
Oh my...

4377
02:42:57,910 --> 02:42:58,490
Why?

4378
02:42:59,930 --> 02:43:01,570
Why did you walk up?

4379
02:43:04,730 --> 02:43:05,350
Just...

4380
02:43:05,350 --> 02:43:06,590
Just play him.

4381
02:43:06,870 --> 02:43:08,530
Just stop playing Iron Fist.

4382
02:43:08,850 --> 02:43:10,490
Just play Black Panther at that point.

4383
02:43:11,090 --> 02:43:11,550
Just...

4384
02:43:18,430 --> 02:43:19,210
Oh my god.

4385
02:43:19,270 --> 02:43:19,990
He's so low.

4386
02:43:20,370 --> 02:43:21,310
The moon!

4387
02:43:24,370 --> 02:43:25,010
Oh no.

4388
02:43:25,570 --> 02:43:26,570
She's gonna disappear.

4389
02:43:29,080 --> 02:43:30,250
Oh my god.

4390
02:43:31,070 --> 02:43:32,110
She's gonna disappear.

4391
02:43:33,530 --> 02:43:34,610
The moon!

4392
02:43:41,770 --> 02:43:44,110
A good Black Panther is so fucking scary.

4393
02:43:44,270 --> 02:43:44,870
I just...

4394
02:43:44,870 --> 02:43:46,210
I don't know what to do, guys.

4395
02:43:48,170 --> 02:43:48,710
What?!

4396
02:43:50,790 --> 02:43:51,950
Oh, he's gone!

4397
02:43:52,150 --> 02:43:53,550
Oh, thank god!

4398
02:43:56,550 --> 02:43:58,430
The evil has been defeated!

4399
02:43:59,330 --> 02:43:59,950
Oh my god.

4400
02:43:59,990 --> 02:44:01,870
Someone actually broke his knees!

4401
02:44:03,050 --> 02:44:04,490
I'm so happy.

4402
02:44:06,430 --> 02:44:06,990
Okay.

4403
02:44:07,750 --> 02:44:08,350
I...

4404
02:44:08,350 --> 02:44:09,010
Like...

4405
02:44:09,010 --> 02:44:09,730
I don't know.

4406
02:44:10,190 --> 02:44:10,790
What...

4407
02:44:10,790 --> 02:44:12,570
I don't know what I can do to save that.

4408
02:44:15,750 --> 02:44:16,350
Alright.

4409
02:44:16,450 --> 02:44:17,390
I had to use that.

4410
02:44:17,470 --> 02:44:17,990
They were...

4411
02:44:17,990 --> 02:44:20,830
This is scary because...

4412
02:44:20,830 --> 02:44:22,930
They do have strange ult.

4413
02:44:23,530 --> 02:44:24,410
So like...

4414
02:44:24,410 --> 02:44:26,810
I don't know.

4415
02:44:29,150 --> 02:44:29,550
Alright.

4416
02:44:32,290 --> 02:44:32,950
That's fine.

4417
02:44:33,410 --> 02:44:34,290
We're still healthy.

4418
02:44:35,890 --> 02:44:37,490
Our strange is like...

4419
02:44:38,310 --> 02:44:39,730
Crazy as fuck.

4420
02:44:39,790 --> 02:44:40,410
Not gonna lie.

4421
02:44:40,750 --> 02:44:43,670
Our strange is so...

4422
02:44:44,350 --> 02:44:45,690
It's actually crazy.

4423
02:44:46,430 --> 02:44:47,970
I'm dancing for my fucking life.

4424
02:44:47,970 --> 02:44:48,530
Right now.

4425
02:44:51,570 --> 02:44:52,490
It's okay.

4426
02:44:54,410 --> 02:44:55,370
It's okay.

4427
02:44:56,310 --> 02:44:57,590
Oh my...

4428
02:44:57,590 --> 02:44:58,930
Okay, that was...

4429
02:44:59,870 --> 02:45:01,350
That was so...

4430
02:45:01,350 --> 02:45:04,550
Oh my...

4431
02:45:04,550 --> 02:45:04,910
Okay.

4432
02:45:05,230 --> 02:45:05,910
You know what?

4433
02:45:05,990 --> 02:45:06,650
That's fine.

4434
02:45:07,470 --> 02:45:08,110
That's...

4435
02:45:08,110 --> 02:45:08,850
Just...

4436
02:45:08,850 --> 02:45:09,510
That's alright.

4437
02:45:09,730 --> 02:45:10,010
You know?

4438
02:45:10,230 --> 02:45:10,850
That's okay.

4439
02:45:10,970 --> 02:45:12,910
How do we live that?

4440
02:45:12,970 --> 02:45:13,690
We don't.

4441
02:45:13,770 --> 02:45:14,990
We don't.

4442
02:45:14,990 --> 02:45:16,530
We don't live that.

4443
02:45:16,530 --> 02:45:18,870
How do we die to our moon knight?

4444
02:45:19,530 --> 02:45:20,530
That's crazy.

4445
02:45:24,130 --> 02:45:24,890
What?

4446
02:45:28,270 --> 02:45:28,830
A storm?

4447
02:45:29,390 --> 02:45:30,930
Just copy me.

4448
02:45:32,970 --> 02:45:33,730
No.

4449
02:45:36,210 --> 02:45:36,570
No.

4450
02:45:37,490 --> 02:45:37,970
No.

4451
02:45:38,250 --> 02:45:39,050
Oh, he got it.

4452
02:45:39,390 --> 02:45:40,070
He got it.

4453
02:45:40,510 --> 02:45:41,090
Disappear!

4454
02:45:41,090 --> 02:45:41,350
Disappear!

4455
02:45:44,510 --> 02:45:46,550
I can't believe he said...

4456
02:45:46,910 --> 02:45:48,290
Copy my storm.

4457
02:45:48,290 --> 02:45:49,850
I can't...

4458
02:45:49,850 --> 02:45:52,250
I can't believe he said that.

4459
02:45:56,010 --> 02:45:57,970
Copy my storm.

4460
02:45:58,430 --> 02:46:00,390
And then our Loki was like...

4461
02:46:02,770 --> 02:46:03,230
No.

4462
02:46:11,710 --> 02:46:12,230
Alright.

4463
02:46:13,410 --> 02:46:14,350
This is so winnable.

4464
02:46:14,690 --> 02:46:16,030
I believe, guys.

4465
02:46:16,990 --> 02:46:17,610
I believe.

4466
02:46:18,490 --> 02:46:19,810
We can get out of this.

4467
02:46:20,270 --> 02:46:21,090
He was not right.

4468
02:46:21,330 --> 02:46:21,830
I don't know.

4469
02:46:21,890 --> 02:46:23,250
I don't listen to fair one tricks.

4470
02:46:23,610 --> 02:46:25,190
Their opinions are invalid to me.

4471
02:46:27,370 --> 02:46:28,230
I'm sorry.

4472
02:46:31,430 --> 02:46:34,130
They might as well just not have any opinions.

4473
02:46:36,750 --> 02:46:37,270
Fair.

4474
02:46:38,670 --> 02:46:39,070
True.

4475
02:46:42,330 --> 02:46:43,350
It's true.

4476
02:46:44,450 --> 02:46:45,050
Woah!

4477
02:46:51,050 --> 02:46:51,990
Are you really sorry?

4478
02:46:52,070 --> 02:46:52,450
I'm not.

4479
02:46:52,590 --> 02:46:52,990
You're right.

4480
02:46:53,110 --> 02:46:53,530
I'm not.

4481
02:46:53,730 --> 02:46:54,750
I'm not sorry.

4482
02:46:55,210 --> 02:46:56,070
You're on it.

4483
02:46:56,610 --> 02:46:58,830
Every fair one trick I've met...

4484
02:46:58,830 --> 02:47:00,330
was a fucking asshole.

4485
02:47:00,870 --> 02:47:02,090
Like, literally...

4486
02:47:02,090 --> 02:47:04,950
The season started three hours ago...

4487
02:47:04,950 --> 02:47:06,390
and he was bitching.

4488
02:47:06,570 --> 02:47:08,090
I'm like, bro, are you...

4489
02:47:08,090 --> 02:47:09,090
Bro, how are you...

4490
02:47:09,090 --> 02:47:11,290
How are you this tilted already?

4491
02:47:11,750 --> 02:47:14,470
The season started three hours ago...

4492
02:47:14,470 --> 02:47:18,450
and your support is getting fucking fucked right now...

4493
02:47:18,450 --> 02:47:20,930
by Psylocke and Black Panther...

4494
02:47:20,930 --> 02:47:22,490
and you don't look up, turn around.

4495
02:47:28,040 --> 02:47:30,060
And he's like, where am I?

4496
02:47:30,180 --> 02:47:33,360
And it's like, me and the Mantis looked at each other...

4497
02:47:33,360 --> 02:47:35,500
and was like, I don't know, man.

4498
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:39,780
I don't know, man.

4499
02:47:42,400 --> 02:47:46,160
Like, we're trying our best to survive right now.

4500
02:47:46,220 --> 02:47:46,960
Like, what?

4501
02:47:50,040 --> 02:47:52,480
I don't see what is...

4502
02:47:52,480 --> 02:47:54,780
Like, how do you die that fast?

4503
02:47:57,540 --> 02:47:59,720
I don't understand.

4504
02:48:02,840 --> 02:48:04,840
I need to keep...

4505
02:48:04,840 --> 02:48:06,900
making sure he's alive.

4506
02:48:09,100 --> 02:48:10,780
Jesus Christ.

4507
02:48:11,020 --> 02:48:14,020
Our tanks are taking so much damage, though.

4508
02:48:14,540 --> 02:48:16,040
It's actually crazy.

4509
02:48:18,520 --> 02:48:19,620
Let's go.

4510
02:48:21,100 --> 02:48:22,140
Let's fucking go.

4511
02:48:22,360 --> 02:48:25,100
How did you die, broski?

4512
02:48:29,700 --> 02:48:30,540
Ow!

4513
02:48:36,900 --> 02:48:39,460
I am ready to put on a show!

4514
02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:40,980
Those portals, man.

4515
02:48:43,760 --> 02:48:44,100
What?

4516
02:48:49,660 --> 02:48:52,500
Alright, broski was like, don't worry, I got both support odds!

4517
02:48:52,880 --> 02:48:55,740
And then he was like, what the fuck do you mean?

4518
02:48:55,840 --> 02:48:57,160
The Mantis just ultied.

4519
02:48:59,780 --> 02:49:00,240
Nope.

4520
02:49:06,040 --> 02:49:08,060
He lied about... What?

4521
02:49:10,980 --> 02:49:13,460
How did you...

4522
02:49:14,480 --> 02:49:15,360
What?

4523
02:49:15,560 --> 02:49:17,420
Did she die in storm all?

4524
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:22,280
Wait, what?

4525
02:49:23,160 --> 02:49:25,500
Did he die in storm all?

4526
02:49:30,240 --> 02:49:34,480
I literally heard storm all and then she's dead!

4527
02:49:34,980 --> 02:49:36,940
I thought you were invincible!

4528
02:49:37,980 --> 02:49:40,260
Like, how the fuck do you die?

4529
02:49:42,240 --> 02:49:45,480
How do you die in storm all?

4530
02:49:46,300 --> 02:49:49,000
Yeah, and then he was like, Loki, copy me.

4531
02:49:50,380 --> 02:49:54,840
Yeah, this is exactly... Oh my god, this is exactly why.

4532
02:49:58,460 --> 02:50:00,060
Pro bump boots.

4533
02:50:00,280 --> 02:50:03,680
I couldn't... I think you gotta nerf that Ankh.

4534
02:50:03,740 --> 02:50:05,140
I literally couldn't react.

4535
02:50:05,240 --> 02:50:07,920
I couldn't react to the Ankh in time.

4536
02:50:09,660 --> 02:50:13,820
I legitimately just couldn't react to, like, destroying the Ankh.

4537
02:50:15,260 --> 02:50:16,860
Which is really tilting.

4538
02:50:18,440 --> 02:50:21,460
It's really tilting when I can't react to that.

4539
02:50:21,980 --> 02:50:22,740
Oh no.

4540
02:50:23,360 --> 02:50:24,320
Oh my word.

4541
02:50:24,320 --> 02:50:26,840
Where do you think my teammates are?

4542
02:50:26,980 --> 02:50:27,860
Let me...

4543
02:50:27,860 --> 02:50:29,260
Oh, there you are.

4544
02:50:29,420 --> 02:50:33,380
Sorry, I gotta... I had to figure out where it is.

4545
02:50:33,780 --> 02:50:34,660
Alright, there you go.

4546
02:50:36,340 --> 02:50:37,860
I was like, where are they?

4547
02:50:44,460 --> 02:50:46,320
I hope that...

4548
02:50:48,860 --> 02:50:49,940
Oh, that's awkward.

4549
02:50:50,160 --> 02:50:50,720
That's awkward.

4550
02:50:50,840 --> 02:50:51,440
I don't think the...

4551
02:50:51,440 --> 02:50:53,440
Guys, I don't think the...

4552
02:50:55,540 --> 02:50:57,480
Alright, don't worry.

4553
02:50:57,940 --> 02:50:59,160
They'll be fine, right?

4554
02:50:59,420 --> 02:51:00,920
Yo, you're so healthy.

4555
02:51:01,920 --> 02:51:04,020
You're so healthy, guys.

4556
02:51:04,300 --> 02:51:06,780
You guys are all so healthy.

4557
02:51:08,460 --> 02:51:09,440
Oh wait, that's insane.

4558
02:51:09,900 --> 02:51:11,080
That's insane.

4559
02:51:12,440 --> 02:51:16,340
Please, somebody kill... kill these guys.

4560
02:51:17,960 --> 02:51:18,640
Nice.

4561
02:51:19,140 --> 02:51:20,220
We did it.

4562
02:51:21,900 --> 02:51:23,940
Oh, he died mid-cast?

4563
02:51:24,500 --> 02:51:26,880
Oh, I was like, there's no way he...

4564
02:51:27,440 --> 02:51:29,300
Yeah, no, he definitely died mid-cast.

4565
02:51:29,420 --> 02:51:30,900
He got CC'd mid-cast.

4566
02:51:31,200 --> 02:51:33,140
Because he got 50% of it back.

4567
02:51:33,300 --> 02:51:34,260
Oh my god, we're in Diamond.

4568
02:51:34,480 --> 02:51:35,560
I'm finally free.

4569
02:51:36,040 --> 02:51:37,340
I can get my bans back.

4570
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:39,980
Oh my god, I get it back.

4571
02:51:43,120 --> 02:51:43,640
Yay!

4572
02:51:44,660 --> 02:51:45,600
I'm free!

4573
02:51:46,600 --> 02:51:49,100
I'm... I'm...

4574
02:51:49,100 --> 02:51:52,540
Jeez, I rest now.

4575
02:51:54,620 --> 02:51:56,990
How much... wait, how...

4576
02:51:57,460 --> 02:52:00,980
How much sleep did you even get?

4577
02:52:01,760 --> 02:52:02,780
I'm actually curious.

4578
02:52:07,550 --> 02:52:10,580
Oh my god, guys, we did it.

4579
02:52:11,180 --> 02:52:13,600
We're... we're... we're out.

4580
02:52:14,340 --> 02:52:14,720
We're...

4581
02:52:16,500 --> 02:52:18,200
Okay, that's not bad.

4582
02:52:18,840 --> 02:52:19,860
He got 4 hours.

4583
02:52:20,060 --> 02:52:23,600
He basically slept 5 hours for like...

4584
02:52:24,360 --> 02:52:25,500
48 hours.

4585
02:52:26,740 --> 02:52:28,080
That's pretty bad.

4586
02:52:28,500 --> 02:52:34,920
That's... that's pretty bad.

4587
02:52:35,160 --> 02:52:35,880
Hey, guys!

4588
02:52:36,880 --> 02:52:38,560
That was really fun!

4589
02:52:39,100 --> 02:52:40,600
That's really...

4590
02:52:40,600 --> 02:52:41,800
That was really fun.

4591
02:52:41,900 --> 02:52:42,600
I had...

4592
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:45,540
I had a great time checking out the new updates.

4593
02:52:48,240 --> 02:52:49,640
And... and, like I said...

4594
02:52:51,080 --> 02:52:54,920
Emart Rival Streams on... on YouTube will not be very frequent.

4595
02:52:55,320 --> 02:52:57,300
I'll mostly be doing it to check out new updates.

4596
02:52:57,600 --> 02:53:00,640
So if you want to check out, like, rank grinds and everything...

4597
02:53:00,640 --> 02:53:05,420
Please, please, please feel free to follow me on Twitch because I'll mostly do, like, Twitch rank grind if I'm on Twitch.

4598
02:53:05,720 --> 02:53:06,120
So, yeah!

4599
02:53:06,200 --> 02:53:06,980
Check me out there.

4600
02:53:07,480 --> 02:53:09,220
It was really fun checking out the new characters.

4601
02:53:09,440 --> 02:53:11,600
I had a fun time looking out... looking at...

4602
02:53:12,620 --> 02:53:14,640
Invisible Woman and Mr. Fantastic.

4603
02:53:15,060 --> 02:53:20,920
I literally think, like, Invisible Woman is very situational because I feel like Luna Mantis is still just stronger because of Luna.

4604
02:53:21,380 --> 02:53:23,740
But Wolverine is definitely busted, like...

4605
02:53:27,380 --> 02:53:28,660
Wolverine is...

4606
02:53:28,660 --> 02:53:31,940
Wolverine seems really fucked up.

4607
02:53:35,160 --> 02:53:38,480
So, I think Hawkeye definitely got mega nerfed.

4608
02:53:38,560 --> 02:53:41,100
I think Hawkeye and Hela doesn't seem that strong anymore.

4609
02:53:41,880 --> 02:53:43,980
As I was, like, playing against Hawkeye and Hela.

4610
02:53:44,380 --> 02:53:44,920
Hey, guys!

4611
02:53:45,380 --> 02:53:45,920
Hey, guys!

4612
02:53:46,200 --> 02:53:48,360
I hope you guys had a fun time checking out the new updates with me.

4613
02:53:49,320 --> 02:53:49,720
And...

4614
02:53:49,720 --> 02:53:51,940
Watching me get back to... at least to Diamond.

4615
02:53:52,340 --> 02:53:53,600
As always, everybody...

4616
02:53:54,420 --> 02:53:55,220
Stay hydrated.

4617
02:53:55,580 --> 02:53:56,260
Posture check.

4618
02:53:56,520 --> 02:53:58,320
Get a move around to get that blood flowing.

4619
02:53:58,480 --> 02:53:59,980
And if you stay up for me, head to bed!

4620
02:54:00,300 --> 02:54:00,700
Cause...

4621
02:54:00,700 --> 02:54:01,420
You deserve it!

4622
02:54:01,780 --> 02:54:04,120
I'm gonna make my bulldog noodles!

4623
02:54:05,240 --> 02:54:06,040
For, like...

4624
02:54:06,040 --> 02:54:07,580
Lunch, dinner, breakfast today.

4625
02:54:07,860 --> 02:54:08,920
I didn't eat lunch.

4626
02:54:08,960 --> 02:54:10,240
I ate breakfast today.

4627
02:54:10,240 --> 02:54:11,500
But then, like...

4628
02:54:11,500 --> 02:54:12,540
I didn't eat lunch or dinner.

4629
02:54:12,700 --> 02:54:14,340
Because I went straight to bed.

4630
02:54:14,600 --> 02:54:15,780
I was so fucking tired.

4631
02:54:15,820 --> 02:54:16,600
You guys don't understand.

4632
02:54:16,960 --> 02:54:17,980
I was so tired.

4633
02:54:18,060 --> 02:54:20,420
Like, after the rank grind, I just went to bed.

4634
02:54:20,620 --> 02:54:21,580
And then, like...

4635
02:54:21,580 --> 02:54:23,060
I woke up, streamed.

4636
02:54:23,200 --> 02:54:24,540
And then, I went to bed.

4637
02:54:24,820 --> 02:54:26,200
And then, I woke up.

4638
02:54:26,860 --> 02:54:27,960
Streamed this one.

4639
02:54:28,340 --> 02:54:31,240
And now, I guess I eat lunch, dinner, and breakfast.

4640
02:54:31,380 --> 02:54:32,660
Cause it's four in the morning.

4641
02:54:35,120 --> 02:54:35,920
Alright, guys!

4642
02:54:36,180 --> 02:54:37,720
I'll see you guys next time, everybody!

4643
02:54:38,260 --> 02:54:39,060
Bye, guys!

4644
02:54:39,900 --> 02:54:40,420
Oh, yeah!

4645
02:54:40,580 --> 02:54:42,920
For those who don't know my Twitch, I might as well just post my Twitch link.

4646
02:54:43,240 --> 02:54:45,000
If you guys want to watch more Marvel...

4647
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:46,380
I don't know when I'll be doing...

4648
02:54:46,380 --> 02:54:46,740
I don't know.

4649
02:54:47,080 --> 02:54:47,360
Sometimes...

4650
02:54:47,360 --> 02:54:50,060
I plan on doing scheduled Twitch streams at least once a week.

4651
02:54:52,660 --> 02:54:53,380
Once a week.

4652
02:54:53,700 --> 02:54:55,760
So, like, check me out on Twitch if you want to.

4653
02:54:56,320 --> 02:54:56,840
Anyway, guys.

4654
02:54:56,900 --> 02:54:57,820
I'll see you guys next time, everybody!

4655
02:54:58,020 --> 02:54:58,620
Bye, guys!

4656
02:54:58,980 --> 02:54:59,260
Bye!
