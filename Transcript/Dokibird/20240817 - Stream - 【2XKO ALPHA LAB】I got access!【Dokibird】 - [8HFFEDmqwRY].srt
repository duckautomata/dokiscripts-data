1
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Whoa!

2
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,680
Wait, where am I?

3
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,180
Oh, hey!

4
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,560
I was just like, wait a minute, where am I?

5
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,480
Professional streamer, by the way.

6
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,820
You guys wanna know how professional I was?

7
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:15,680
For those who just got here and was not at pre-chat, basically, I may or may not have procrastinated when it came to activating my invite that Mattman gave me.

8
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,700
Because I was like, it'll be fine.

9
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,640
Mattman said it's like unlimited invites.

10
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,160
As long as I click accept, I should be like, it'll be fine.

11
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,860
And then I clicked on it this morning, and it was like, this code has been claimed.

12
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,860
I was like, uh-oh.

13
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,360
Uh-oh.

14
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,780
I was like, wait a minute.

15
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,060
I thought it was unlimited.

16
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,320
Unlimited means that it's not limited.

17
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,260
I should be able to claim it.

18
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,360
And then I messaged Matt, and I was like, Matt, I fucked up.

19
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,780
I fucked up.

20
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,980
I procrastinated.

21
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,960
I know you gave me this code last week, but I'm redeeming it now, because I have a stream today.

22
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,320
I know I fucked up.

23
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:16,760
I know you gave it to me last week, and I could've, you know, claimed it any other of those days.

24
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,260
But you don't understand.

25
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,180
You don't understand, Matt.

26
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,160
That was so eepy.

27
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,600
Every day I was just so eepy.

28
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,220
Anyway.

29
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,500
And then Matt gave me a bunch of links, but then they were all claimed.

30
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,220
I didn't understand.

31
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,220
How were they all claimed?

32
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,540
I got sent five different links, and none of them worked.

33
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:53,900
And then we messaged SageM, but he was streaming, so he's usually not online on Discord when he's usually not online on Discord when he's streaming.

34
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,060
So I was like, uh oh.

35
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,420
I have an hour left to stream.

36
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,300
I have an hour left!

37
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,140
And then I messaged BrawlPro.

38
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,900
I was like, BrawlPro SOS, do you have a code?

39
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,060
And then luckily he sent me three links.

40
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,660
And the third link worked.

41
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
Thank God.

42
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,960
So we got in!

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,540
We got in 2xKO!

44
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,180
And this is why you need to network.

45
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,040
Thank God.

46
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,100
Networking has saved me yet again!

47
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:40,620
Anyway, today we are going to be trying out Riot's new fighting game 2xKO.

48
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,380
Basically, it is a fighting game that uses League of Legends characters.

49
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,520
I liked how people were like, Oh my God, I can't believe Doki plays League.

50
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,620
I do not play League.

51
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,480
So I have zero knowledge on who any of these characters are.

52
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,360
Except for Ahri.

53
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:04,540
I only know the existence of Ahri because she is like the character.

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,960
You know how in Overwatch there's Mercy and she's like the character of Overwatch?

55
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,600
All I know is that Ahri is like the character in League.

56
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,580
You know what I'm talking about?

57
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,700
That's why I know about...

58
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,200
That's how I know about Ahri.

59
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,480
Also, a little bit of fun fact.

60
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,220
The FNAF...

61
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,120
Oh, so by the way, I'll be using keyboard for...

62
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,120
I'll be using... I thought it was because of Faker.

63
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,260
No, you guys all know why Ahri is very popular and it's not because of Faker.

64
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:05,760
Anyway, I'll also be using keyboard because I try to unpack everything and like I don't know where I put my leverless controller.

65
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,140
I don't know where it is.

66
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,560
I have so many boxes guys.

67
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,960
I don't know where it is.

68
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,840
I...

69
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,620
I have so many boxes.

70
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,080
I don't remember where I packed it.

71
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,840
So, we're going to be using keyboard because I don't know.

72
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:35,740
I can't... I don't know where I put it and I can't be bothered to unpack right now.

73
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,000
Also, another update.

74
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,040
Another update regarding...

75
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,400
So, a little life update on...

76
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,100
the FNAF VOD.

77
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,900
So, if you guys didn't know, my Five Nights at Freddy's Into the Pit video stream got age-restricted.

78
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,920
So, what does that mean?

79
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,160
That basically means you have to be 18 or older to watch that stream.

80
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,960
So, I messaged my YouTube guy when it got age-restricted because I was like, what the fuck happened?

81
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,700
Like, why?

82
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,520
Like, is it the title?

83
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,560
And...

84
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,180
Okay.

85
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,040
Alright.

86
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:16,860
Then...

87
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,120
And he was like, it's not the title.

88
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,240
And I was like, wait, then what is it?

89
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,320
And he was like, it appears to be due to profanity.

90
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,100
And I was like, oh, did I fuck up?

91
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,540
Did I swear too much in the first 10 minutes?

92
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,740
And then, I'm gonna read you what he wrote to me.

93
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,160
He was like, um...

94
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,840
I don't have specifics on exact timestamps, but...

95
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,500
there was definitely a lot of profanity through Some

96
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,910
moderate is usually okay.

97
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:05,070
But excessive profanity, especially if it's a lot in the short time window, can lead to age restrictions.

98
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,090
And I was like...

99
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,410
And I was like...

100
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,650
More than usual?

101
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,250
More than unusual streams?

102
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,930
That has to be a record.

103
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,410
That really has to be a record for me.

104
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,750
I said a lot of profanity on my stream.

105
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:38,930
But for some reason, this particular stream had the most... had so much profanity in such a short amount of time span that it got age restricted.

106
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:43,090
And it's not just one exact moment, it's throughout the stream.

107
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:48,330
So I may or may not have went just a little bit too far.

108
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,730
And like, I just want you guys to know, I've never been age restricted before.

109
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,650
Like, I've never been like...

110
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,610
I've been like demonetized before.

111
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,630
But I've never had an R18 age restriction.

112
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:09,870
There has been demonetization, but never has it been R18 restricted because of the profanity!

113
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,590
That is like... that is a for me!

114
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,030
I was so surprised!

115
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:26,810
I just love how my YouTube guy was like, there was a lot of profanity throughout the stream!

116
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,510
Because he was like, I can't give you timestamps!

117
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,210
There was just...

118
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,990
There was just so much!

119
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,230
There was so many!

120
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,470
So...

121
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,530
So yeah!

122
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,870
That's why... so they're like...

123
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,370
He was like, sorry, I really...

124
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,630
I didn't do anything about it, so yeah!

125
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,890
Enjoy my R18 into the pit stream!

126
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,370
My very first R18 stream!

127
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,070
And it was for FNAF!

128
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,730
It was for fucking FNAF!

129
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,370
I can't believe it!

130
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,110
Also, how do you guys like my acoustics right now?

131
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:13,470
The soundproofing... not soundproof, sorry, the echo proofing for today's stream!

132
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,870
Today I put up more... like I...

133
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,770
I put up more stuff so there should be like less...

134
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,130
even less echo now.

135
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:28,950
So like I actually put up some some corner foam, some acoustic panels and everything.

136
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,870
There's still like more foam I have to put up.

137
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,390
But like, it's getting there.

138
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:42,890
I'm a little bit worried that when I get the plushies out, like it's just gonna go backwards, so like it's gonna get...

139
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,790
I feel like...

140
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,050
I feel like the moment I like...

141
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,930
remove the plushies, like everything is just gonna reset itself.

142
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,230
So... so...

143
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,130
I have yet to remove the plushies on the floor because I am...

144
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,310
a little worried about that.

145
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,600
Anyway, I don't know how long I'll be streaming today.

146
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,340
As you guys know, I'm not really a fighting game streamer.

147
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,780
I did sign up for the next Sajam Slam for Street Fighter.

148
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,720
Because I did say like, oh yeah, let's run it back.

149
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,460
So like, we'll see.

150
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,580
I'm not sure...

151
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,960
I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it in this time around, because like I know there's like a lot of people.

152
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,960
A lot of people that signed up for the Street Fighter Sajam Slam.

153
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,200
So, we'll see.

154
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,920
We'll see.

155
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,260
I hope I do get in.

156
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,360
I really wanna be on the same team again.

157
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,280
With Team Brawl Pro.

158
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,380
I hope I get them again.

159
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,380
It was really fun.

160
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,960
But yeah!

161
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,680
We'll see.

162
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,120
We'll see.

163
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,160
Anyway, I have not a lot of experience in fighting games.

164
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,140
Tekken was...

165
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,660
Okay, I was gonna say...

166
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,840
What was that other fighting game?

167
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,640
The one with...

168
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,120
The one with the anime... Skullgirls!

169
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,560
Skullgirls was the very first time I actually tried a fighting game on stream.

170
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,720
But even then, it wasn't like... I didn't really play... I only did like one stream of it.

171
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:11,300
But Tekken was like the very first fighting game where I actually tried to understand the combos and everything.

172
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,440
Yeah, it might be like two combos.

173
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,720
But I tried.

174
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,320
I...

175
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,460
I did... I did try to understand it, okay?

176
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,420
I did try to figure out the combos.

177
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,300
And I did...

178
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,260
I got a... I bought a leverless controller and every... Okay, no.

179
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,160
Actually, I didn't buy one.

180
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,860
The... What was it called?

181
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,100
The... Like, Sajam Slam...

182
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,360
Oh my gosh!

183
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,480
It wasn't even like... It's not even Sajams.

184
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,080
It was like...

185
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,480
It was like a leverless controller company sent me one for free.

186
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,240
So, like, I even got one for free too.

187
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,100
So, I actually took it very seriously for Sajam Slam.

188
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,880
Yeah, the snack box!

189
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,720
Yes, yes, yes!

190
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,060
Junk food arcades.

191
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

192
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,580
They sent me a free one.

193
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,840
And everything.

194
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,500
So, yeah.

195
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,160
I don't know where I put it.

196
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,620
So, we're not going to be using one...

197
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,640
using it right now.

198
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,000
I just don't know where it is.

199
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,320
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,560
I don't know where I put it.

201
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,060
There's so many boxes!

202
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,660
So, we'll see how it goes.

203
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,180
Like I said, I don't really know much about League of Legends or, like, League characters.

204
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:29,420
And, like, I don't... I'm actually going in fully blind on, like, this game.

205
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,200
But I have heard good things about it.

206
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:38,780
I have heard some good things regarding Riot's take on the fighting game genre.

207
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,200
Alright.

208
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,840
Let's see.

209
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,860
Let me...

210
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,740
Where is it?

211
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,180
Okay.

212
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,300
I forgot to...

213
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,880
It's called Lion.

214
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,300
Like the EXE.

215
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,780
It's not even called, like...

216
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,380
Wait.

217
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,060
Oh my gosh.

218
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,920
Don't tell me it's only window capture again.

219
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,500
Let me see.

220
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,160
Oh, no.

221
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,320
It's because I haven't even shown it.

222
00:13:59,400 --> 00:13:59,920
Okay, there you go.

223
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,200
Please don't tell me it's window capture.

224
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,920
Okay, nice.

225
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,580
Alright.

226
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,720
I don't know who the fuck these people are.

227
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,880
To be fair, League has, like, a billion characters.

228
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,280
They've been around for, like, how many years already?

229
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,680
Like, 15 plus years?

230
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,240
They have, like, a billion fucking characters in League in general.

231
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,660
So, it's like, how do you keep track of this?

232
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,800
I mean, good for them.

233
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,720
They don't have to... Technically, they don't have to, like, make new characters.

234
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,560
They can just drag, like, League of Legends characters and just put it in.

235
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,720
So, they don't... Technically, they don't have to really design new concepts or anything.

236
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,780
They just, like, grab it from a pre-existing uh... pre-existing game.

237
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,400
Logging you in.

238
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,960
Maybe I should have logged in first.

239
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,780
I'm just like, why is this taking so long?

240
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,940
Two hundred...

241
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,260
Yeah, that's actually insane.

242
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,520
Two hundred... I'm always wondering, like, how do you balance that?

243
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,780
Like, how do you balance two hundred characters?

244
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,740
Like, what if, like...

245
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,980
That's... that's almost...

246
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,180
That has to be impossible.

247
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,580
You don't.

248
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:05,840
Yeah.

249
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,440
Do you just, like, uh... like, what happens to, like, the shitty characters then?

250
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,360
Do they just...

251
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,180
Like, you can't really one-trick a character if you think about it.

252
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,460
Because, like, um, they just never...

253
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,920
They release it and they just never touch it again.

254
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,700
Like...

255
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,500
Devs just never do anything to the character after they released it and then they're abandoned.

256
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,640
And the patch notes are only, like, their favorite characters, like Ahri.

257
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,700
And that's it.

258
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,780
...

259
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,300
...

260
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,400
...

261
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,740
Yeah, I was just thinking.

262
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,300
Also, does it usually take this long to log me in?

263
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,980
I'm like...

264
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,620
They balance the game every two weeks?

265
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,220
That sounds fucking terrible.

266
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,380
Like, that actually sounds terrible.

267
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,660
The meta will decide?

268
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,780
Wait, how do they decide the meta?

269
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,320
Oh.

270
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,380
They usually... You might... I need to restart the game.

271
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,320
Okay, I'll restart the game.

272
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,400
I'm like, wait a minute.

273
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,080
Why am I not locked in yet?

274
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,340
Okay.

275
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,120
I'll restart the game, guys.

276
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,160
Alright.

277
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,100
Play.

278
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,880
Where is it?

279
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,080
Why is it not...

280
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,060
Why does it not play?

281
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,140
Hello?

282
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,180
Did I fuck it up already?

283
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,640
You know what?

284
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,020
I'm me.

285
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,660
I won't be surprised if I fucked it up already.

286
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Wait, I'm logged out?

287
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,880
How did I got logged out?

288
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,180
I already got logged out!

289
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,780
What did I I just closed the game and it logged me out!

290
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,320
Alright, give me a sec, guys.

291
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,220
I'm going back in.

292
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,220
Play.

293
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,080
It's not even my fault!

294
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,480
This wasn't even my fault!

295
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,400
It just...

296
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,620
It just didn't work.

297
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,660
Oh, there it is!

298
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,560
Missing.

299
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,300
I am... I'm new.

300
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,220
Or haven't played then go easy on me.

301
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:02,820
I'm new.

302
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,900
I like how competitor is like, I have a hat.

303
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,560
I don't like that.

304
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,260
I'm a competitor.

305
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,920
Do you see my hat?

306
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,080
Alright.

307
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:15,860
What?

308
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,360
Ooh.

309
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,280
Thank you for joining Alpha Lab.

310
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,820
Alright, let's see.

311
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:20,540
Progression.

312
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,000
Where are the characters?

313
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,400
Wait.

314
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,040
2, 4.

315
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,520
Oh, there's only 2, 4.

316
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,800
Oh, there's only 6 characters.

317
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,860
I just thought there'd be more.

318
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,720
Alright.

319
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,420
Let's see.

320
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,240
Oh, is that me?

321
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,320
Can I change myself?

322
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,380
I want a hat too.

323
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:34,640
Oh!

324
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,120
Okay.

325
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,280
I want a hat.

326
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,000
Alright.

327
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,220
Oh my god!

328
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,820
Oh, okay.

329
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,760
I'm not rich enough.

330
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,280
Okay.

331
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,380
Let's see.

332
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,460
Blue and yellow.

333
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,960
Alright.

334
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,740
Nice.

335
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:46,840
Okay.

336
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,560
Hands.

337
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,420
Feet.

338
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,760
No.

339
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,620
Alright.

340
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,140
No.

341
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,380
Oh.

342
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,140
Alright.

343
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,380
What's...

344
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,380
Okay.

345
00:17:59,420 --> 00:17:59,800
Body.

346
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,980
You gotta unlock it.

347
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,940
What about this?

348
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,260
Oh!

349
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,800
Wait, there's more customization!

350
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,820
Alright.

351
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,620
Uh...

352
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,340
Are these just eyebrows?

353
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,440
Oh, they're eyebrows.

354
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,300
Alright.

355
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,440
I'm gonna start mewing.

356
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,580
No, you don't understand.

357
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,880
This is very important.

358
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,960
I need a mew.

359
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,240
Alright.

360
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,220
Let's see.

361
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,060
Uh...

362
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,180
Eyebrow color?

363
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,480
That's not right.

364
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,380
What is this?

365
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,020
Are these nose?

366
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,980
Oh, they're details!

367
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:37,700
Okay.

368
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,940
Are there eye bags?

369
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,160
To show how dead inside I am?

370
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,920
I might as well be goth too.

371
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,000
You know what?

372
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,280
Yeah.

373
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:45,860
Let's do it.

374
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,240
Let's be fucking goth.

375
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,140
Let's fucking go.

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,620
Let's go.

377
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,380
Let's fucking go.

378
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,220
Alright.

379
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,540
Alright.

380
00:18:59,640 --> 00:18:59,920
There we go.

381
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,680
Hairstyle.

382
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,180
Wait.

383
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,220
Why is it still brown?

384
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,620
Why is it still brown?

385
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,240
Hello?

386
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,160
Alright.

387
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,520
Yes!

388
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,120
That looks goth enough.

389
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,140
That looks emo enough.

390
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,060
Oh, I have to double click it.

391
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:23,560
Alright.

392
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,580
Oh shit.

393
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:24,820
No.

394
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,700
No beard.

395
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,460
I'm here to be...

396
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,360
I'm here to be emo.

397
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,880
I'm here to be emo.

398
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,320
I am dead inside right now.

399
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,220
Alright.

400
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,900
Let's see.

401
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:37,920
You know what?

402
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,420
Yeah.

403
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,600
Okay.

404
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,360
If I'm gonna be... Oh.

405
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:40,900
Okay.

406
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,100
Curvy and sporty.

407
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,460
Whoa.

408
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:44,980
Whoa.

409
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,240
What if I want to be curvy and sporty?

410
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,060
Okay.

411
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,940
Let's see.

412
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,920
Whoa.

413
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:53,560
Sorry.

414
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,800
I'm too absorbed with the jiggle there.

415
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,300
Okay.

416
00:19:59,360 --> 00:19:59,920
Uh...

417
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,460
Yeah.

418
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:03,900
Uh...

419
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,540
Face, hairstyle, body, eyes.

420
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,380
You know what?

421
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,180
I should wear something that fits my soul.

422
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,060
Uh...

423
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,020
There we go.

424
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,640
This fits how I feel in the inside.

425
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,300
Uh...

426
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,200
And then... There we go.

427
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,240
There we go.

428
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,560
I'll be a goth slash emo kid.

429
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:25,740
Nice.

430
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:26,880
Oh.

00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,260
Thank god.

432
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:27,940

433
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,460

434
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,220

446
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,800

00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,900
Don't follow me.

455
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,180
I don't know how to play this game.

456
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,720
I...

457
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,600
Don't follow me.

458
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,880

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,040
Alright.

464
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,420
I don't want to fight you.

465
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,960
You look like you know what you're doing.

466
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,760
It's not fair.

467
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,320
It's not fair.

468
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:33,720
It's not fair.

469
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,560
He looks like he knows what he's doing.

470
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,280
I... I don't know what I'm doing.

471
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,320
I...

472
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,320
I don't know what I'm doing.

473
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,360
Okay.

474
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:39,900
Ari.

475
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,520
Huh?

476
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,840
I'll be blue.

477
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,780
I'll be blue, Ari.

478
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,080
I don't fucking... You know what?

479
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,540
I'm going to mirror match you.

480
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,800
You seem to know what you're doing.

481
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:49,800
I'll be blue.

482
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,020
You seem to know what you're doing.

483
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,880
Press attack buttons rapidly Press attack buttons rapidly for devastating combos.

484
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,060
Wait.

485
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,760
I shouldn't... Why didn't it go straight in?

486
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,000
Why didn't I do the tutorial?

487
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,160
I'm like...

488
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,960
I don't even know the controls.

489
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,820
I can't even button match.

490
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,060
Because I don't have my libraus controller.

491
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,940
Why didn't it go straight into this?

492
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,560
Why did I do this?

493
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,160
Why did I do this to myself?

494
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,560
Alright.

495
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,300
I'm learning the hard way.

00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,620
I don't need... how do I... what are the buttons?

00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,200
I just know how to walk back and jump!

510
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,100

Wait, what?

517
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,720
What the fuck?

Okay.

00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,720
Oh shit!

523
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,700

00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,760
Okay, is it... cabinet?

552
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,420
No.

553
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,480
No.

554
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,100
Oh my god, please.

555
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,200
Where's the training mode?

556
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,520
I don't... I believe...

557
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,720
Oh, back to the menu.

558
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,820
Okay, thank god.

559
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,140
Alright.

560
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,300
I... I... I just see fight!

561
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,080
I... I went straight into fight!

562
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,080
I assumed that was it!

563
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,460
I saw fight and I was like...

564
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,000
That has to be, like, where I go, right?

565
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,880
Okay, what the fuck is S1?

566
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,020
I am on my keyboard right... right now.

567
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,680
Oh no, nobody expected me to be on the keyboard.

568
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,020
Nobody...

569
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,440
I'm pretty sure nobody...

570
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,200
This game was like, why the fuck are you on your keyboard?

571
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,480
I'm sorry!

572
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,240
Oh my god, alright.

573
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,980
Okay, I didn't know!

574
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,140
I thought I keyboard!

575
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,060
Alright.

576
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,060
Okay, let's see.

577
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,420
I must... I'm gonna find my... where's my roller?

578
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,640
Okay, wait, I have my PS5.

579
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,000
Okay.

580
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,560
I got my PS5 controller.

581
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,580
Alright.

582
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,300
Alright, here we go.

583
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,060
I'm plugging in the controller.

584
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,820
I've given up.

585
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,720
I've already... I've given up on the... on the keyboard.

586
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,940
I... I've... I know my place now.

587
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,920
I... I know my place.

588
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,340
Wait, I can't...

589
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,280
Oh, there it is!

590
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:25,700
Training!

591
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,760

592
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,860
Thank god!

593
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,860
Wait, you play on keyboard?

594
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,560
Oh, okay.

595
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,560
Oh, okay.

596
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,660
Alright.

597
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,440
Okay.

Alright.

601
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,220
What the fuck?

602
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:50,960
Oh, okay.

603
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,400
Alright, JJ.

604
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,680
Oh, it's JJ!

605
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,500
Okay.

606
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,820

608
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,300
Okay.

609
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,200
Alright.

610
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,580
Those are the moves.

611
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:01,880
Alright.

612
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,540
JJ, JJ, JJ.

00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,440
JJ, JJ, JJ, JJ, JJ.

00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,280
JJ, JJ, JJ, JJ.

616
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:10,420
Alright.

617
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,420
We figured it out, guys.

618
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,040
Now I know how he hit me.

619
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,700
Oh, K, K, K.

620
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,900
K, K, K.

621
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,400
K, K, K.

622
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:17,540
K, K, K.

623
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,140
K, K, K.

624
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,600
K, K, K.

625
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,080
Wait.

626
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,460
Oh, that's so sick.

627
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:20,940
Alright.

628
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,520
Guys, we figured it out.

629
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,000
Guys, we figured it out how to...

630
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,800
how to do moves now.

631
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:27,700
Alright.

632
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,600
Heavy combo.

633
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,680
I mean, it's really pretty.

634
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,160
Graphics are nice.

635
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,520
Some of the alpha is...

636
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,300
I assume it's going to get better too, the graphics.

637
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,480
Alright.

638
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,560
Okay, L, L, L, okay.

639
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:43,820
Alright.

640
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:45,820
Nice.

641
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,260
Are there actual beginners still in this game?

642
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:49,800
Like...

643
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,460
I know, like, you know, I know Alpha's gonna end in, like, two...

644
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,380
It's gonna end in two days, but, like, there has to be, like...

645
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,960
There has to be, like, you know, beginners like me too, right?

646
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:03,900
Oh, throw!

647
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,060
No.

648
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,000
No.

649
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,320
No!

650
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,540
Oh.

651
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,840
I know how to move.

652
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:11,660
Block.

653
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:12,720
That's right.

654
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,640
Do you guys see that new fighting game where it's, like, all jiggle physics?

655
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,740
And then, like, whenever you get hit on, it's, like, get a hit on the...

656
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,740
And they're all ladies.

657
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,660
And then when you get hit on, it, like, slo-mo's it.

658
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,220
Oh.

659
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,780
Do you guys see it?

660
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,420
It was on Twitter.

661
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,420
And people were like, why does, like, every hit cause a slo-mo?

662
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,660
Like, you know why.

663
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,400
Did any of my mods see it so they could link it?

664
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,900
I thought that was so funny.

665
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,860
I was like, what the fuck?

666
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,140
Alright.

667
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,520
Let's see.

668
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,840
What the fuck?

669
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,340
Oh.

670
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,260
Why did the volume...

671
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,520
Why is there no more music?

672
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,820
Oh, there it is.

673
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,220
What?

674
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,080
Oh!

675
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:05,440
Oh!

676
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,740
Oh, it's cause I muted my- muted it myself.

677
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,420
Uh, how do I do this?

678
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:17,890
Um.

679
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:20,410
Huh?

680
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,010
Oh, fuck.

681
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,800
Let me hit you!

682
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,640
Guys, I'm bringing- I'm bringing my- I'm using a 60% keyboard.

683
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,320
I- Give me a sec.

684
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,620
I'm gonna- I'm gonna grab my keyboard.

685
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,160
Uh, it must be because I'm using a 60% keyboard.

686
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,080
It must be it.

687
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,100
I don't have- By the way, I don't even have arrow keys on that keyboard.

688
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:07,920
I-

689
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,850
There was, like, no arrow keys.

690
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,310
I had to press two extra buttons to get the arrow keys in.

691
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,190
Oh my god.

692
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,990
I have no arrow keys on this.

693
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:28,210
I had to, like, I had to press, like, function key.

694
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:32,050
I had to hold function key and then press, like, alt menu.

695
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,670
Like- Okay.

696
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,430
Oh yeah, there it is!

697
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,390
Yeah, Battle Queen!

698
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:39,910
Battle Queen.

699
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,430
That's the- That's the game I was talking about!

700
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:44,570
Alright.

701
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,610
Also, sound, guys.

702
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,310
Everything okay?

703
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,230
Sound-wise?

704
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,330
Alright, where the fuck is the- Okay, there it is.

705
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,090
Alright.

706
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,510
Now I have arrow keys now.

707
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,330
Alright.

708
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,390
Okay, that was a lot easier.

709
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:57,430
Alright.

710
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:00,910
Did I not do it?

711
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:03,390
Oh!

712
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:03,750
Oh!

713
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:03,970
Okay.

714
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,510
I did it.

715
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,750
Alright.

716
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:08,810
Uhh...

717
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,690
Did I do that?

718
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:11,970
No, I didn't do that correctly.

719
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:13,770
Huh?

720
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,810
Oh there you go.

721
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,110
It's so many, like, cutscenes though.

722
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,230
I just noticed that too.

723
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,370
It feels like all of it is, like, special.

724
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,690
Everything is, like, special in general.

725
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:26,450
Uhh...

726
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,150
Eh.

727
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,510
Here we go.

728
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:30,710
Here's a kiss!

729
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,670
That's a lot of- We are not supers.

730
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,790
Oh, swap partners?

731
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,950
Hold.

732
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:47,730
Oh, that's... oh!

733
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:50,650
I thought that said queue.

734
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:56,330
Okay, assists have a two-second cooldown.

735
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,670
Oh, that's what I did before!

736
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:04,470
You must wait... wait, okay, two sec... is it two seconds yet?

737
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,530
Okay.

738
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:07,790
Okay.

739
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,710
Come on!

740
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,070
Give me the other assist!

741
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,490
There we go.

742
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:14,370
Okay.

743
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,410
Do I need one more?

744
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,390
Okay, one more assist.

745
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:18,790
Oh!

746
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:23,370
Tap team while assist is...

747
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:23,730
Huh?

748
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:24,690
Oh!

749
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,770
Is that?

750
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:29,230
Oh!

751
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:30,990
Okay.

752
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,390
That's how you do it.

753
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,270
Huh?

754
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,670
And then I stay.

755
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:37,190
Okay.

756
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,030
I get it.

757
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,450
And then I stay.

758
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,670
And then...

759
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:41,810
Oh!

760
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:42,710
No!

761
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,490
I have to wait again!

762
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:45,590
Okay.

763
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,130
And then... I'm in.

764
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,650
Okay, tap team and hit opponent.

765
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:52,990
Okay.

766
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,180
And then hit.

767
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,100
Oh, that's so cool!

768
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,680
This reminds me of Marvel versus Capcom.

769
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,980
Wait, no.

770
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,920
Is it Marvel versus...

771
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,120
Yeah, Marvel versus Capcom.

772
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,840
That's what it reminds me of.

773
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,340
Like the...

774
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,280
The tag team.

775
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,180
Okay.

776
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,240
Hello?

777
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:21,960
Hello?

778
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,960
What's going on with my keyboard?

779
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,740
I was like...

780
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,080
No!

781
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,100
Do it again!

782
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,080
No!

783
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,680
Wait, you're fighting back?

784
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,240
Okay.

785
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:37,700
Wait!

786
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,320
No!

787
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,040
No!

788
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,740
Don't fight back!

789
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,820
You're not supposed to!

790
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,100
Okay.

791
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,540
When being hit by a combo.

792
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,660
All right.

793
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,600
Did I do it?

794
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,140
No?

795
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,160
Okay, I didn't get hit.

796
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,820
And then...

797
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,700
Did I do it?

798
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,660
How do I do this?

799
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,340
Huh?

800
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,740
Oh, while being hit.

801
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,180
Okay.

802
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,940
I'm spamming it, but it's not letting me.

803
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,220
Oh, my God.

804
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,060
Okay.

805
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,480
My food is here.

806
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,040
No!

807
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,080
I have to do this.

808
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,580
This is not what I wanted!

809
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,420
Oh, there you go!

810
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,180
I did it!

811
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:15,600
I did it!

812
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:15,880
Okay.

813
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,860
It has to be...

814
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,200
Oh, it's a counter!

815
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,320
Oh, so I have to time it correctly!

816
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,400
Try and hit me.

817
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:23,460
No!

818
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,140
Not like that!

819
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,080
Nice.

820
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,280
Okay.

821
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,160
Okay.

822
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:26,580
I got it.

823
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,020
I got it.

824
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,460
I got it.

825
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,440
Okay, I have to time it perfectly.

826
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,160
Alright.

827
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,400
Guys, I think I'm ready.

828
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,560
I think I figured it out, guys.

829
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,880
Okay.

830
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:39,620
Casual.

831
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,480
Maybe this time.

832
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,340
Oh, I'm alone.

833
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,040
Okay.

834
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:47,920
Okay.

835
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,680
Guess I'm alone.

836
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,440
Guys, maybe this time.

837
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,700
Alright.

838
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,540
Shirley!

839
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,320
Any friends?

840
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,560
Any friends here?

841
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,260
Lonely, Mr. Lonely.

842
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,520
I have nobody.

843
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,780
I'm pretty sure I'm literally the only beginner in this entire game right now.

844
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:24,180
I'm pretty sure, like, the last alpha codes were sent out, like, a week ago.

845
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,580
And I just got in.

846
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,780
I just got in today just for this stream.

847
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,160
There's no way!

848
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,320
How am I alone?

849
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,080
Alright.

850
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,280
Fuck this.

851
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,980
Fuck this.

852
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,220
I'm ranking my own match.

853
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,560
There has to be dragoons who got in.

854
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,320
Right?

855
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,420
Alright.

856
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,740
Alright, this is my private lobby.

857
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,140
Um...

858
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,000
How are you guys gonna find it?

859
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,700
Wait, how do you guys find my private lobby?

860
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,180
Um...

861
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,540
What?

862
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,860
I don't even know.

863
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,500
I don't know how you guys can find my private lobby.

864
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,260
What's the ID?

865
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,220
That's a very good question.

866
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,740
What is my ID?

867
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,220
Oh, there it is!

868
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,560
Guys, guys, I found it!

869
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:09,820
Alright.

870
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,860
Alright, this is the ID.

871
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:15,720
Guys.

872
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,740
Alright.

873
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,260
Uh...

874
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,300
Training...

875
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,300
Okay, join cabinet.

876
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:21,960
Alright, guys.

877
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,820
Get in here.

878
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,840
Ready up to play solo.

879
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,320
Wait, no!

880
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,020
I need friends.

881
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,020
Guys!

882
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,000
2v2!

883
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,480
Guys, 2v...

884
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,160
Get in here!

885
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:31,780
I see you guys!

886
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,360
Get in here!

887
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:32,740
2v2!

888
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,040
2v2, guys!

889
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,320
Alright, I'm ready.

890
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,040
Alright.

891
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,680
What's this nerd that doesn't even have an avatar?

892
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,260
Alright, everybody.

893
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,300
Alright, everybody.

894
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,620
Watch me get...

895
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,600
Don't call me in!

896
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,320
Okay, Alan?

897
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,780
Don't call me in!

898
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,420
Don't...

899
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,360
Don't call me in!

900
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:06,800
You go fight as long as you can, and then when you die, then you call me in!

901
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,840
You know what?

902
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,480
I'll...

903
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,000
I'll be...

904
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,520
I...

905
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,640
I...

906
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,040
Alan, you got this!

907
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,480
You got this, Alan!

908
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,320
I believe in you!

909
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,760
I literally have no idea who any of these characters are, except...

910
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,280
Except for Ahri.

911
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,620
That's literally the only...

912
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,980
The only character I know.

913
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,400
Fury...

914
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,020
Pulse?

915
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,300
What does that mean?

916
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,760
Don't tag me in, Alan!

917
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,500
You tag me in when you're fucking dead!

918
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,260
Alright, thank you for the super chat!

919
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:43,560
Thank you!

920
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,100
Thank you!

921
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,940
I love you, Doki!

922
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,020
You always make me laugh, even when I'm sad.

923
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:47,900
Thank you!

924
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,060
Thank you for the super chat!

925
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,340
Thank you!

926
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:49,880
Thank you!

927
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,220
I really appreciate that!

928
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,140
I'm glad that...

929
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,400
You've been enjoying my streams!

930
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:58,750
Alright.

931
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:00,930
Oh my god!

932
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,010
Strong woman!

933
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,190
Oh, thank god I'm not first!

934
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:06,750
Go, Alan!

935
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:07,850
Do your thing!

936
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,370
Holy shit!

937
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:12,450
This game looks so fast compared to, like, me on the tutorial!

938
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,350
Me in the tutorial, this game was like...

939
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,210
Oh, Alan!

940
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,190
Don't you dare tag me in!

941
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,630
Keep fighting!

942
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:22,590
Yeah!

943
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,150
Oh, Alan!

944
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:25,690
Oh my god!

945
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:26,110
Holy shit!

946
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,490
You see?

947
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,030
He actually knows how to play!

948
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,210
Oh my god!

949
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:30,690
I hit him!

950
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,750
Don't use your assist!

951
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:35,830
You have no assist!

952
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:45,210
I like how the other team, they're actually, like, you know, working together and like...

953
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,630
Bro, he's just 1v2!

954
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:49,170
If you...

955
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:55,070
If you call me in, I will never... I'm kicking you off the team.

956
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,270
Alan, no!

957
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:56,910
Alan!

958
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,470
Yay!

959
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,100
Wait, Alan, call me in at the last moment.

960
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,520
When she's like 1HP, call me in when she's 1HP, okay?

961
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,060
Not when you're 1HP, when she's 1HP.

962
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,600
Alright, nice.

963
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:18,680
Nice.

964
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,180
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

965
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,780
Almost there, Alan.

966
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,400
Just like two more hits, two more hits.

967
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,300
Oh, call me in, call me in!

968
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,500
No, Alan, you're not supposed to die!

969
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,020
That's okay, I'll finish the job.

970
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:31,840
Oh, shit!

971
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,080
Alan, what do I do?

972
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,960
Oh, shit.

973
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,000
Oh, shit, it's not what I expected.

974
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,200
I did it!

975
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,320
I did it!

976
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,380
I did it, guys!

977
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,000
I clutched it for Alan!

978
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,520
Guys, I clutched it when he needed me the most!

979
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,100
Alan, don't call me in yet.

980
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:13,540
Not yet.

981
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,540
Not yet, Alan.

982
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,280
Not yet.

983
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,800
Wait, I can help!

984
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,380
Watch this!

985
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,380
Am I doing anything, Alan?

986
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,060
Oh!

987
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,820
Alan, I did that!

988
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,520
I can do that again!

989
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,080
Am I doing it?

990
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,080
Alan, no!

991
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,400
Alan, wait!

992
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,120
She's full HP, Alan!

993
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,280
Okay, don't worry, I got this.

994
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,200
I got this, don't worry.

995
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,000
I... Alan...

996
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,420
Oh, shit, I got this!

997
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,740
Oh, super!

998
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,820
Am I doing it?

999
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,860
My game crashed.

1000
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,680
Guys, I did it!

1001
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,300
I won!

1002
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,000
The whole lobby crashed!

1003
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,540
Oh, my God!

1004
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,780
I did it!

1005
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,720
I helped!

1006
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,960
The all was so strong!

1007
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,120
That it crashed the entire lobby!

1008
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,440
That's actually crazy!

1009
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,140
I can't believe it crashed the entire lobby!

1010
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,080
I was like, am I doing it?

1011
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,360
Am I doing it?

1012
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,920
Yes, Toki!

1013
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,100
Yes, sweetie, you did it!

1014
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,280
You did it, sweetie!

1015
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,180
I was just too powerful!

1016
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:58,580
Alright...

1017
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:00,500
Wait...

1018
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,520
We gotta...

1019
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:02,620
Okay...

1020
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,940
We gotta cancel, so I...

1021
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,940
Because you guys don't even have the lobby code!

1022
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,520
I forgot to give you guys the lobby code!

1023
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:11,900
Holy shit!

1024
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:12,960
Okay!

1025
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,360
Next scene!

1026
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,200
Thank you for the super chat!

1027
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,100
Thank you, thank you!

1028
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,780
Peak of meeting timing!

1029
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,020
Alright!

1030
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,200
Alright!

1031
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,220
Here we go again!

1032
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,560
Here we go!

1033
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,240
Wait, no!

1034
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:23,780
I don't...

1035
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,500
Alright, guys!

1036
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,160
I can't be the first person in the...

1037
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,440
Alright, Flux!

1038
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,560
Oh my god!

1039
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,820
Team Goth Emo!

1040
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,160
Versus...

1041
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,120
Holy shit!

1042
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,880
Versus the ner...

1043
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,580
The tech...

1044
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,420
The nerds!

1045
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,040
The nerds versus the goth emos!

1046
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,320
Oh, I cancelled it!

1047
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:42,800
No, no, no!

1048
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,580
No!

1049
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,760
Guys!

1050
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,000
Get off the cabinet!

1051
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:46,600
Guys!

1052
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,240
I'm not even in!

1053
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,260
Guys!

1054
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:52,860
No!

1055
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:53,900
Team...

1056
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,100
Guys!

1057
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,840
Guys, I wanna play!

1058
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,580
Please!

1059
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,080
Guys!

1060
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,300
I wanna play!

1061
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,160
Please!

1062
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,500
Please!

1063
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:06,760
Okay..

1064
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:06,980
Nice!

1065
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:07,400
Alright!

1066
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:07,820
Guys!

1067
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,140
Win me!

1068
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,100
Alright!

1069
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,140
Alright...

1070
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:11,820
Don't worry!

1071
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,480
This time...

1072
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,040
This time, I...

1073
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,060
I did it correctly!

1074
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,580
Wait, where's my goth kid?!

1075
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,500
Where's my goth kid?!

1076
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:20,460
Alright...

1077
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,480
This time...

1078
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,880
This time, I know what I'm doing!

1079
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,460
I know what I'm doing this time!

1080
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,160
Don't worry!

1081
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:28,900
What?

1082
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,500
Alright, nice.

1083
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,580
Technically, I... Wait, they have skins?

1084
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,340
Wait!

1085
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,120
Wait, that's not fair!

1086
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,320
Why do you have skins?

1087
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,380
Wait a minute!

1088
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,500
That's not fair!

1089
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,160
TeamGothEmo destroys the arcade's only caps.

1090
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,040
Doki reckoning.

1091
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,120
Thank you for the super chat.

1092
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,780
Luka, thank you, thank you.

1093
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,740
Oh, do I get to pick?

1094
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,940
Wait, they both have skins!

1095
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,320
Wait!

1096
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,200
These fucking nerds!

1097
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:17,470
Alright.

1098
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:19,570
Who's fighting first?

1099
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,300
Aww, that's so cute!

1100
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,080
Oh shit!

1101
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:28,880
Oh shit!

1102
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,600
Swap me out!

1103
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:30,300
Swap me out!

1104
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,040
Swap me out!

1105
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:31,900
Swap me out!

1106
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,900
Swap me out!

1107
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,260
Swap me out!

1108
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:33,580
Swap me out!

1109
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,200
No!

1110
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,780
Swap me out!

1111
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,340
Swap me out!

1112
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,660
I don't... I don't...

1113
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,000
No, please!

1114
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,180
I don't know how to... I forgot how to do it!

1115
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,420
Darius...

1116
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,020
You should've swapped me out.

1117
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,800
I tried so hard to tag!

1118
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,040
I... I panicked!

1119
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,120
I was panicking!

1120
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:10,920
It's okay!

1121
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:12,600
Darius!

1122
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,700
You know what you're...

1123
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,440
Oh, Darius does not know what he... does not know what he's doing!

1124
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,100
Oh!

1125
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:17,420
Oh!

1126
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,300
I can help you!

1127
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,360
I did it!

1128
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:20,960
Oh!

1129
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,160
You're welcome!

1130
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,060
You're welcome!

1131
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:24,880
I did that!

1132
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,760
Oh my god!

1133
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,500
Look at me go!

1134
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,100
Look at me go!

1135
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,440
I'm gonna keep doing it!

1136
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,180
Watch this!

1137
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,820
In two seconds!

1138
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,500
In two seconds!

1139
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,300
Watch this!

1140
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,720
I'm... I'm coming in soon!

1141
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,700
Don't worry!

1142
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,400
Right here!

1143
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,520
That's right!

1144
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,100
Yeah!

1145
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:48,840
That...

1146
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,900
I did it!

1147
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,120
Oh my god!

1148
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:52,960
Oh...

1149
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,700
No!

1150
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,200
Don't get hit!

1151
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:54,700
Don't get hit!

1152
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,240
No!

1153
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,580
Class!

1154
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,300
I did so much!

1155
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,840
Okay, nice.

1156
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:05,420
Don't worry!

1157
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,360
Don't worry!

1158
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:06,920
I'm here to help!

1159
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,360
Don't worry!

1160
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:11,920
I got you!

1161
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,960
I don't know what's going on, but I got you!

1162
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:16,680
Wait!

1163
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,360
Oh, that's you!

1164
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:17,820
Okay!

1165
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:18,960
I'm going in!

1166
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,340
Assist!

1167
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:20,500
Assisting!

1168
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,120
You're welcome!

1169
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,100
Don't worry!

1170
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,200
Here I come again!

1171
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:29,540
That's fucking right!

1172
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:29,720
Wait!

1173
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,680
I got knocked off!

1174
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,420
Where am I?

1175
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,440
Here I come in again!

1176
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:37,800
I'm doing it!

1177
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,980
Oh, it's okay.

1178
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:39,660
I blocked it!

1179
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,000
I blocked the damage!

1180
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,220
Don't worry, man!

1181
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,220
I got you!

1182
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,520
I'm... I'm coming over again!

1183
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:46,780
Don't worry!

1184
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,900
I blocked more damage!

1185
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,440
Oh!

1186
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,060
You were supposed to live!

1187
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,080
Oh!

1188
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,420
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!

1189
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,090
That's fucking right!

1190
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,550
Alright, that's what you deserve.

1191
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,790
I let you... whoa, whoa, whoa, no!

1192
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,230
Oh my god, please.

1193
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:14,270
Please.

1194
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:15,610
It's okay.

1195
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:16,770
I know what I'm doing.

1196
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:18,950
No!

1197
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:21,290
No, no, no, no, no!

1198
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:25,350
Not cookies!

1199
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,090
Not the cookies!

1200
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,490
We were so close!

1201
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,710
We were so close!

1202
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:54,640
I think, like, I felt like, you know, like, you know, it's impossible to clutch when, like, when, like, it's a 1v2, you know, for me.

1203
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:58,180
It's sort of really difficult to do it when it's a 1v2, guys.

1204
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:08,200
Like, like, guys, I don't know how much more I could do.

1205
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,620
I don't...

1206
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,480
Like, how much more could I do, chat?

1207
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,940
Wait, what about me?

1208
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,800
Do I get to play?

1209
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,420
Oh, they left the game.

1210
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:31,800
Nice.

1211
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,060
Okay.

1212
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,440
Wait, how do I...

1213
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,080
How do I join this game?

1214
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,340
Like, join cabinet queue.

1215
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:38,880
Oh, okay.

1216
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,780
Wait, I want to be in it.

1217
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,520
I want to be in it.

1218
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:42,380
Except...

1219
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,060
Alright.

1220
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,700
I'm going to be on my team.

1221
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,560
Wait, it's 1v1?

1222
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:48,500
Alright.

1223
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,040
You know what?

1224
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:49,880
Let's try something new.

1225
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,360
Wait, it's 1v1?

1226
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:53,460
Okay, you know what?

1227
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,140
I want to try strong woman.

1228
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,020
And then strong man.

1229
00:48:58,940 --> 00:48:59,340
Alright.

1230
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,680
Big woman, big man.

1231
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:10,800
I have no idea if this is meta or not, but...

1232
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,000
The moment I win a game, it's over.

1233
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,580
I've downloaded this entire game in my head.

1234
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,820
I am a muscle team.

1235
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,680
How can I lose?

1236
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,900
I put it all on strength.

1237
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,080
Look at her.

1238
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,120
She's like twice the size of his team.

1239
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:33,140
Him alone is like twice... Look at him!

1240
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,400
Look how tall she is!

1241
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,740
I'm going to fucking squish you.

1242
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:36,860
I'm going to... Oh, shit.

1243
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:37,260
Okay.

1244
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,780
He brought a knife.

1245
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,780
He brought a sword.

1246
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:40,500
Okay.

1247
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,760
He knows what he's doing.

1248
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,320
Okay.

1249
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,000
Okay.

1250
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,680
This is... This is an issue, guys.

1251
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,660
He brought a sword to a fight.

1252
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,700
I have a fucking shield and arms.

1253
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,660
Like, what am I supposed to do?

1254
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:57,540
I...

1255
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,460
What am I... I can't even move!

1256
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:04,720
Please!

1257
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:07,700
Oh, okay.

1258
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,520
What?

1259
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:09,920
Okay.

1260
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,200
Oh, my God.

1261
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:11,840
Just block?

1262
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,180
I've never even blocked in Tekken!

1263
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,000
Oh, I blocked!

1264
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:15,800
I blocked.

1265
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,520
I'm dead.

1266
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,580
Okay, watch this.

1267
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,460
There we go.

1268
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,160
That's a block.

1269
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,000
That's also a block.

1270
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,960
And then... Oh!

1271
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:26,940
Please!

1272
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,060
The man needs to get one hit in!

1273
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,100
Please!

1274
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,860
I just went one hit!

1275
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,400
Holy shit!

1276
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,400
Yes!

1277
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,000
Oh, my God!

1278
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,340
That's 200 hits!

1279
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:41,900
Where am I?

1280
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,440
Oh, I don't know!

1281
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,740
I don't know where I am!

1282
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,840
What the fuck?

1283
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,460
This is not fair!

1284
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,040
All I have are my arms!

1285
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,700
And he has a sword!

1286
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,380
This should not be legal!

1287
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,240
Okay.

1288
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:04,360
Okay.

1289
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,620
All right.

1290
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,000
Block.

1291
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:07,140
Block.

1292
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:08,660
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1293
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,380
I'm on the other side.

1294
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:10,640
How did I get to the other side?

1295
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,840
I... How does he have so much range?

1296
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:15,460
How?

1297
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,580
How does he?

1298
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,560
How does he have so much range?

1299
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,320
What?

1300
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,000
What did I do?

1301
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:24,640
I did that.

1302
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:25,800
Nice.

1303
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,120
That's fucking right.

1304
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:28,720
Okay.

1305
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:30,340
Nice.

1306
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:30,720
Okay.

1307
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,500
I'm hitting.

1308
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,480
I'm hitting.

1309
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,960
I'm... I'm doing stuff.

1310
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,000
I'm not doing anything anymore.

1311
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,120
I'm on...

1312
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,520
Where am I?

1313
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,320
Am I in the air?

1314
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,020
I'm getting... I'm being made into sushi?

1315
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,000
Okay.

1316
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:51,680
All right.

1317
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,120
It's okay.

1318
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,600
I know how to block.

1319
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,940
The moment I touch the ground, it's over for you.

1320
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,240
The moment I touch the ground, I will start blocking.

1321
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,000
Oh, my God.

1322
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:06,800
Please.

1323
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:07,500
Please.

1324
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,140
Let me at least block once.

1325
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:09,900
Please.

1326
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,080
That's all I ask.

1327
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,320
I just... I just want to block once.

1328
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,580
Oh, my God.

1329
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,420
Oh, my God.

1330
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,560
I got... I got the block, guys.

1331
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,060
I got the block.

1332
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,420
It's okay.

1333
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:31,380
I... I managed to block a little bit.

1334
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:32,660
I just won.

1335
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,260
Oh, my God.

1336
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,060
What the fuck...

1337
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,720
He's been... He's been juggling me and everything.

1338
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,580
What... What the fuck?

1339
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:48,020
Guys... Guys, can we have our tag team fight again?

1340
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,540
Guys, let's... Guys, let's tag team everybody.

1341
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:52,020
Guys, let's...

1342
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,160
We should... We should tag team, guys.

1343
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,720
How do we set it to tag team?

1344
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,700
Oh my god.

1345
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:06,940
That was...

1346
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,840
That was sad.

1347
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,920
That was an attempt.

1348
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,780
How are they not tag teaming?

1349
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,500
Sorry, that was my...

1350
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,040
Wait.

1351
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,400
What the fuck?

1352
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:28,920
Oh.

1353
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,940
No, that's the...

1354
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,680
This is not tag team?

1355
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:35,980
Guys, leave.

1356
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:36,880
This is my lobby.

1357
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,320
Guys, this is my lobby.

1358
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:53,060
Guys, this is my lobby.

1359
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:56,980
I wanna be...

1360
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,560
I wanna be...

1361
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,400
Be in the big leagues.

1362
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,520
Oh, can I get down this couch?

1363
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,060
Oh.

1364
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,220
Wait.

1365
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,020
Guys.

1366
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,260
We don't need them.

1367
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,200
We can have our own team.

1368
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:09,780
Oh my god.

1369
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:10,840
Team Emo and Goth.

1370
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,640
We're back.

1371
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,340
Team Goth Emo is back.

1372
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:15,700
We're back.

1373
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:16,840
All right, Flux.

1374
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,880
All in on you, Flux.

1375
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,160
Okay.

1376
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:22,940
Apparently...

1377
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,540
What's his name?

1378
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:25,980
Sam...

1379
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:26,760
Or is it this guy?

1380
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:27,860
Oh, one caught.

1381
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,340
Why can't we just have two sword guys?

1382
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:30,700
Okay.

1383
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,360
I think Ahri was like the best I've ever done.

1384
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,600
So we're gonna...

1385
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,560
We're gonna go with Ahri.

1386
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,340
All right.

1387
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,480
I believe in you.

1388
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,220
We're team Emo-Goth.

1389
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:43,700
What could go wrong?

1390
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:51,380
It was so nice of Toki to set up a lobby for drag ghouls to play together.

1391
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,700
Thank you for the super chat cast.

1392
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,180
Thank you.

1393
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:54,680
Thank you.

1394
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,320
Oh, where have we not gone yet?

1395
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,100
We haven't fought in the tavern yet.

1396
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,360
I wanna fight in the tavern.

1397
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:00,680
All right.

1398
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,360
Is Yasuo the really strong?

1399
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,740
Is Yasuo really strong?

1400
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,840
I mean, he has a fucking sword.

1401
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,820
So I assume so.

1402
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,040
All right.

1403
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,240
I'm gonna tag myself out.

1404
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:14,740
All right.

1405
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,160
All right.

1406
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,300
All right.

1407
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,200
Make sure.

1408
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,080
All right.

1409
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:28,220
Nice.

1410
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,380
All right, guys.

1411
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,300
I'm playing...

1412
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,980
I'm Yasuo right now.

1413
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:38,080
So I'm pressing J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, um...

1414
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,340
Left arrow.

1415
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:44,140
J, J, J, K, J, J...

1416
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:47,920
Oh my god.

1417
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,240
I'm so good, guys.

1418
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,200
Holy shit.

1419
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,760
Did you guys see that combo I just did?

1420
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:52,720
That's...

1421
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,100
That's right M right there.

1422
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,020
That's...

1423
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,980
He's just like in league.

1424
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,840
Is he just as hated?

1425
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,860
You know what's funny?

1426
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,640
I saw a tweet.

1427
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,640
Yes, I can like multitask while I'm playing.

1428
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:04,720
Um...

1429
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,740
But like, the funniest shit was that like...

1430
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:13,000
Like some FGC people were like, oh, I've never played league before.

1431
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:17,660
So I guess I'll check it out now that like I've checked out like 2x KO.

1432
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,000
And then so...

1433
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,600
So...

1434
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,200
So they were like...

1435
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,300
But tag me in!

1436
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:22,740
No!

1437
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:29,700
Okay.

1438
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:31,780
Give me a sec.

1439
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:32,400
Wait!

1440
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,080
Wait!

1441
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,240
Get in!

1442
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:34,580
Get in!

1443
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:37,640
Wait!

1444
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:38,200
Wait!

1445
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:38,920
I might still...

1446
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,500
Get in!

1447
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,120
There we go.

1448
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,420
I did it.

1449
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:44,300
Don't worry.

1450
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:44,640
I'll help.

1451
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,180
Don't worry.

1452
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:45,820
I'm gonna help you.

1453
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,240
Don't worry.

1454
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:47,260
Don't worry.

1455
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,400
Don't worry.

1456
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:48,880
I got you.

1457
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,280
Don't worry.

1458
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:50,900
I got you.

1459
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:52,620
Don't worry.

1460
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,660
I got you.

1461
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:54,860
Don't worry.

1462
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:55,600
Just don't tag me.

1463
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,360
I got you.

1464
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:57,880
Just don't tag me.

1465
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,140
Don't worry.

1466
00:56:59,220 --> 00:56:59,840
I'll come back.

1467
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,740
I'll come back right now.

1468
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:02,660
It's okay.

1469
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,100
It's okay.

1470
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:03,860
Right here.

1471
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:04,980
Oh.

1472
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:07,780
Oh.

1473
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,360
Okay.

1474
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:10,720
It's okay.

1475
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:11,240
We're fine.

1476
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,020
We are not fine.

1477
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,680
We're not fine right now.

1478
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:18,400
Please.

1479
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,120
Oh.

1480
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:20,960
It's okay.

1481
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,200
I'm dead.

1482
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:28,840
Okay.

1483
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:31,480
Okay.

1484
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:31,540
Okay.

1485
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,060
We're fine.

1486
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,160
We're fine.

1487
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,420
I can't.

1488
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,420
I can barely.

1489
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,200
Sometimes.

1490
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,860
Sometimes I don't know what's going on.

1491
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,140
I don't know if you guys noticed that.

1492
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:42,460
Sometimes.

1493
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,360
I just.

1494
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,220
I just don't know what's going on sometimes.

1495
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,160
All right.

1496
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:49,480
Don't worry.

1497
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:49,740
I'm here.

1498
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,000
That's right.

1499
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:51,720
I did it.

1500
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,500
I did the thing.

1501
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:55,940
All right.

1502
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,340
Don't worry.

1503
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,500
We're going to get rid of big woman.

1504
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,660
We're going to get rid of big woman.

1505
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,220
Oh my god!

1506
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,080
Did I do it?

1507
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,760
Did I do the thing?

1508
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,320
Oh!

1509
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,040
Oh, he missed!

1510
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:09,400
He missed!

1511
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:10,920
Oh, I got you!

1512
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:12,580
Tag me in!

1513
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,100
Tag me in!

1514
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,080
Tag me in!

1515
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:14,880
Tag me in!

1516
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:19,490
Tag me in!

1517
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:19,910
Tag me in!

1518
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:20,850
Tag me in!

1519
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:20,870
Tag me in!

1520
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:28,070
Guys, he tagged me in.

1521
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:28,930
Did you guys see?

1522
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:32,790
Did you guys... Did you guys see me?

1523
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:34,510
Did you guys see me tag?

1524
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:35,410
I got tagged in.

1525
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:39,270
He got lost in the sauce.

1526
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:41,670
It is combo now.

1527
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:44,130
Guys, I got tagged in.

1528
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:44,750
Guys.

1529
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,390
Wait, I want to be sword guy.

1530
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:50,790
Alright.

1531
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,290
Alright, I got this.

1532
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:55,990
Don't worry.

1533
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:57,150
I saw how he did it.

1534
00:58:58,090 --> 00:58:59,650
I'm pretty confident now.

1535
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:01,750
I saw how he... I saw how he played.

1536
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,110
So, like, I'm 100% very confident.

1537
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,190
Empower your partner with multiple... What is this?

1538
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:12,110
Freestyle... Wait, what should I do?

1539
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:17,150
Pulse... 2x?

1540
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:18,650
Double down?

1541
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:23,410
Is pulse... Pulse lets you auto combo?

1542
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:24,090
Oh, okay.

1543
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:24,790
I'm a beginner.

1544
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:27,830
Alright.

1545
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,150
Where have we not fought?

1546
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:31,270
Have we fought?

1547
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:34,610
Have we fought in the sea yet?

1548
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:35,870
I don't think we have.

1549
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:38,290
Okay.

1550
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:39,030
Don't worry, guys.

1551
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:40,170
I saw what he did.

1552
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:42,230
I saw what he did.

1553
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:46,950
So, like, I'm very confident that I can replicate the exact same thing he did.

1554
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:49,130
The exact same combo.

1555
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:50,790
Okay.

1556
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:54,590
It was like N, M, J, K.

1557
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:56,230
He's like J, J, J, J, K.

1558
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:58,690
K, J, J, J, J, J.

1559
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:00,030
And then M.

1560
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:01,530
And then... Watch this, guys.

1561
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:05,130
Guys, not yet.

1562
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:05,410
Not yet.

1563
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:07,650
Wait, that's not fair.

1564
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:08,950
He's sending people in.

1565
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:10,750
Okay.

1566
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:11,150
Watch.

1567
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:11,710
Oh, my God.

1568
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:12,350
See, I told you.

1569
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:14,150
I knew exactly what he did.

1570
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:15,050
Oh, my God.

1571
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,350
Why does he do so much?

1572
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:18,410
How does he do so... What?

1573
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:20,450
How does he do so much damage?

1574
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:22,130
What the fu...

1575
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:26,330
Holy shit.

1576
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:27,750
Oh, I did that.

1577
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:29,390
No.

1578
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:30,110
Oh, no.

1579
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:31,110
Oh, my God.

1580
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:31,350
Tag.

1581
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:31,950
Tag out.

1582
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:32,410
Tag out.

1583
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:32,850
Tag out.

1584
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:33,310
Tag out.

1585
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:33,790
Tag out.

1586
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:34,310
Tag out.

1587
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:35,430
Tag out.

1588
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:35,930
Tag out.

1589
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:36,070
Tag out.

1590
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:36,550
Please.

1591
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:37,710
Get in here.

1592
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:43,210
Why didn't you tag me out, Flux?

1593
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:45,590
Why didn't you watch me die?

1594
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:53,830
He just... He just watched me die like that.

1595
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:57,930
You have to do... No, no, no.

1596
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:59,390
This is my lobby.

1597
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:03,170
In my lobby, I needed him to tag me out.

1598
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:06,630
Can I, like, participate?

1599
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:12,490
He has to tag for me.

1600
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,690
Holy shit.

1601
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:16,230
What the fuck is he doing?

1602
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:18,730
How do I participate?

1603
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:25,410
This player can't tag my lobby, my rules.

1604
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:26,690
Oh, my God.

1605
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:28,170
They're, like, double teaming him.

1606
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:32,070
This game plays by my rules.

1607
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:32,610
Exactly.

1608
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:35,410
What the fuck is going on?

1609
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:38,810
What is going...

1610
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:45,630
Okay.

1611
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:46,430
Okay.

1612
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:47,270
I figured it out.

1613
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:49,190
Did you see that?

1614
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:49,970
I dodged it.

1615
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:51,530
Boom.

1616
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:54,290
That's fucking right.

1617
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:56,450
Whoa.

1618
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:58,010
I did it.

1619
01:01:59,170 --> 01:01:59,650
Okay.

1620
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,410
I took him to a slaughter.

1621
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:02,450
My bad.

1622
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:07,390
I tagged in just so he could get his shit kicked in.

1623
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:11,770
Don't worry.

1624
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:12,850
I'm helping.

1625
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:15,950
Okay.

1626
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:16,930
That's fucking right.

1627
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:17,670
I got you.

1628
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:18,910
Wait.

1629
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:20,510
Am I in the game?

1630
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:21,030
Wait.

1631
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:22,130
How did I get in?

1632
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,870
How did I get in?

1633
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:26,250
Oh, no.

1634
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:27,170
No, I'm not.

1635
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:27,750
He's blue.

1636
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:29,010
I'm...

1637
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:31,030
He's blue and...

1638
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:32,330
Wait.

1639
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:34,530
What am I?

1640
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:35,150
Am I blue?

1641
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:36,090
Is he blue, too?

1642
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:36,890
Wait.

1643
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:37,890
Are they both blue?

1644
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:40,370
Oh, shit.

1645
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:44,870
I'm blue, too.

1646
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:46,490
Oh, God.

1647
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:49,570
That's fucking right.

1648
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:52,950
We try to fucking do fancy shit.

1649
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:53,670
That's fucking...

1650
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:54,130
Oh, no.

1651
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:54,410
Stop.

1652
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:55,290
Stop.

1653
01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:57,330
What the fuck?

1654
01:02:58,710 --> 01:02:59,270
Okay.

1655
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:00,450
That's right.

1656
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,510
No fancy shit here.

1657
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,270
No fancy shit here.

1658
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:05,410
Oh, God.

1659
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:08,230
What the fuck is this break shit?

1660
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:10,830
What is this break shit?

1661
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:19,210
Oh, my God.

1662
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:20,210
What the fuck?

1663
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:21,610
I did that.

1664
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:24,090
Oh, my God.

1665
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:24,590
I did that.

1666
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:25,470
Oh, shit.

1667
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:27,970
Okay.

1668
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:29,190
But that was pretty cool.

1669
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:30,790
Oh.

1670
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:32,510
No, no, no.

1671
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:32,790
Nice.

1672
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:34,390
Come on.

1673
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:35,590
That's fucking right.

1674
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:37,510
That's fucking right.

1675
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:38,750
I don't know what I'm doing.

1676
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:45,930
Get shit on.

1677
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:48,270
Oh, shit.

1678
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:50,570
Tag, tag, tag, tag, tag.

1679
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:52,590
Tag, tag, tag, tag, tag.

1680
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:53,490
Tag.

1681
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:55,230
Oh.

1682
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:57,390
Tag.

1683
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:58,450
There you go.

1684
01:03:59,290 --> 01:03:59,870
I'm hurt.

1685
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:00,930
I'm hurt.

1686
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:06,490
I don't know what I did, but I'm hurt.

1687
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:07,750
Okay.

1688
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:08,190
Flux.

1689
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:08,850
Flux.

1690
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:09,310
Flux.

1691
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:10,710
Look, I worked so hard on that.

1692
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:11,130
Flux.

1693
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:12,210
Flux, what's going on?

1694
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:12,530
Flux.

1695
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:13,870
Flux, what's going on?

1696
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:14,250
Flux.

1697
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:15,730
Flux, what's going on?

1698
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:16,690
Please.

1699
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:18,270
Do something.

1700
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:18,970
Flux.

1701
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:19,810
Flux.

1702
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,300
Flux, please.

1703
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:27,680
Why didn't you do anything?

1704
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,100
Oh, my God.

1705
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,900
Flux, what the fuck happened?

1706
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,440
Bro, what am I doing?

1707
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,800
Holy shit.

1708
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,060
Oh, my God.

1709
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,500
Flux got fucking... Whoa.

1710
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,720
Oh, God.

1711
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,280
Wait.

1712
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,040
I got it.

1713
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:52,960
I did that.

1714
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:55,980
Oh, God.

1715
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:56,200
Okay.

1716
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:56,980
Yeah, that's fucking right.

1717
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:57,980
No bats for you.

1718
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:58,640
Oh, no.

1719
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:01,260
What's that?

1720
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:02,320
What the fuck is that?

1721
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,360
What?

1722
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,080
Bro got destroyed.

1723
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:10,700
No way.

1724
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,020
No.

1725
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:13,780
Team got evil.

1726
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:18,680
No.

1727
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:19,080
No.

1728
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:23,000
Team got evil.

1729
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,140
It's over.

1730
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:32,660
This is why goth and emo kids should never work together.

1731
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,060
They're two very different styles.

1732
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,320
They're way too different.

1733
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:41,740
Oh, my God.

1734
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:49,220
Holy shit.

1735
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:50,520
That guy was crazy.

1736
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,760
Guys, we need one more.

1737
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:53,440
We need one more.

1738
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:57,720
All I'm saying was that I was clearly the carry, chat.

1739
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:01,120
I was clearly... Okay.

1740
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,860
Because that guy beat me with... What's his name?

1741
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,420
This guy?

1742
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,060
I think I can do it.

1743
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,120
I've downloaded him.

1744
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:12,040
I've downloaded this guy.

1745
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,560
I think I could do the same thing as he did.

1746
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,820
Choose your destination.

1747
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:17,920
All right.

1748
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:23,220
Yeah, I won that one round.

1749
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:24,880
I clutched it.

1750
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,400
I, like, literally 1v2'd.

1751
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:29,360
I literally 1v2'd them.

1752
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,700
But you are lost.

1753
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:41,920
All right.

1754
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,500
This is it.

1755
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,460
I will win my first game.

1756
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,720
Don't tag me.

1757
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,640
Don't tag me.

1758
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:51,240
You better be doing some sick-ass combos.

1759
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,020
What the fuck?

1760
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,240
His range is...

1761
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:55,320
Insane.

1762
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,200
She can't do anything.

1763
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:05,110
Oh, my God.

1764
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:05,350
Wait.

1765
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:06,690
She has tentacle powers?

1766
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:09,210
What the fuck?

1767
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:12,610
Why can't I do that when I played her?

1768
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:13,390
Don't worry.

1769
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:13,910
I'm gonna help.

1770
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:15,350
Don't worry.

1771
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:15,770
I'm gonna help.

1772
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:16,890
Don't worry.

1773
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:17,350
I got you.

1774
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:17,950
I'm gonna help.

1775
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:19,110
Right here.

1776
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:21,330
I think I helped you.

1777
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,850
Guys, I think I helped.

1778
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:25,670
Don't worry.

1779
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:26,510
I'm gonna help you again.

1780
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:27,530
Don't worry.

1781
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,030
Oh, shit.

1782
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:29,590
He's dead.

1783
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:31,410
Don't worry.

1784
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:33,050
I saw how he played.

1785
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:34,570
I can do the same thing.

1786
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:38,410
No.

1787
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:38,930
That's right.

1788
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:39,710
I got hidden.

1789
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:40,510
It's over.

1790
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:42,350
Oh, wait.

1791
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:44,010
Why couldn't you do that?

1792
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:47,350
That's fucking right.

1793
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:48,710
That's right.

1794
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:51,390
I don't know what I'm doing, but that's fucking right.

1795
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:52,670
Oh, wait.

1796
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:53,330
I'm getting shit on.

1797
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:54,310
I am getting shit on.

1798
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:56,390
I am getting shit on.

1799
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:56,630
Please.

1800
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:58,030
Please defend me.

1801
01:07:58,970 --> 01:07:59,410
Okay.

1802
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:02,110
Oh, come on.

1803
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:03,850
Oh, nice.

1804
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:04,890
That's fucking right.

1805
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:05,790
No.

1806
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:06,570
Not right.

1807
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:07,850
Okay.

1808
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:09,710
How is she doing all that?

1809
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:10,890
Oh, shit.

1810
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:13,170
That's fucking right.

1811
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:15,110
You can't block this, bitch.

1812
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:18,470
Oh, my God.

1813
01:08:18,490 --> 01:08:19,070
She blocked it.

1814
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:22,090
Holy shit.

1815
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:22,710
She did it.

1816
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:24,770
She actually blocked it.

1817
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:31,310
I can't believe it.

1818
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:32,390
I can't believe it.

1819
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:34,070
She actually blocked it.

1820
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:35,550
Oh, my God.

1821
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,690
I tanked that for you, bro.

1822
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:40,230
Oh, my God.

1823
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,950
Ari knows what she's doing.

1824
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:44,270
Don't worry.

1825
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:45,630
She'll slowly hit that.

1826
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:46,270
Okay.

1827
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:46,930
She didn't.

1828
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:47,530
Don't worry.

1829
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:48,310
I can do it again.

1830
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:49,490
That's right.

1831
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:50,930
I used my bat.

1832
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:51,990
Don't worry.

1833
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:52,370
Here we go.

1834
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:54,390
He's going to slowly get hit again.

1835
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:56,230
Okay, I okay.

1836
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:56,870
Never mind.

1837
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:57,870
I got okay.

1838
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:58,710
All right.

1839
01:08:58,750 --> 01:08:59,070
Whoa.

1840
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:02,170
Oh wait, I'm still in this fight

1841
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:16,430
What the fuck I'm not helping you anymore, bro

1842
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:29,070
This is not fair That's fucking right.

1843
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:31,050
You didn't block your fucking shins.

1844
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:32,390
That's right.

1845
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:34,030
You should have blocked your foot.

1846
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:34,850
Oh fuck.

1847
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:35,230
Okay.

1848
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:40,670
That's fucking right Then blocked your feet again, bitch.

1849
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,330
That's fucking right.

1850
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:43,330
Why is she blocking feet?

1851
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:45,110
How did she know?

1852
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,130
How do you know?

1853
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:50,270
Oh no.

1854
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:51,430
NOOOOO

1855
01:09:56,750 --> 01:10:07,830
Oh my god I almost... I almost did it... by just hitting the feet Just feet only Clutched it.

1856
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:20,650
They didn't block the grips It was so close Alright All right I'm gonna make a new Lobby so new people can join in, guys.

1857
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:21,970

1858
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:23,990

01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:37,510
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

1866
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:38,110
Thank you, thank you.

1867
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:39,870
Did you know someone tags in and gets hit?

01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:40,950
Both of you take damage.

1869
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:42,570
Happy birthday, Toki.

1870
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:44,090
Thank you for the super chat.

1871
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:44,890
Thank you, thank you.

1872
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:46,130
Oh my god.

1873
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:47,630
I'm alone.

1874
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:52,110
Nobody else is playing this game except for me and you guys.

1875
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:56,410
Except for me and the dragoons.

1876
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,590
And no one else is here.

1877
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:01,350
No one else.

1878
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:02,550
Alright.

1879
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:04,710
I guess I'll make my own private lobby again.

1880
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:05,930
Okay.

1881
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:06,810
Private.

1882
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:10,910
There's no babies.

1883
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:12,650
Why is there no babies?

1884
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:16,370
Alright.

1885
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:17,590
Here's the code.

1886
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:23,010
Just like the real... Yeah, arcade students are not alive right now.

1887
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:24,050
In the west.

1888
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:25,050
Alright.

1889
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:27,170
Here I am.

1890
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:28,790
Guys, we have to win one.

1891
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:30,950
We can't end the stream until we win one, guys.

1892
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:34,230
That's like my own... That's like the only thing.

1893
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:34,610
Wait.

1894
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:35,290
Alan, no.

1895
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:36,190
Alan, no.

1896
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:37,010
Join Alan.

1897
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:38,370
I... No, Alan.

1898
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,080
Alan, why?

1899
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,680
You actually know how to play.

1900
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:50,020
You actually know how to...

1901
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:50,420
Wait.

1902
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,120
Wait.

1903
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:52,100
Why am I by myself?

1904
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:53,720
Guys, I'm gonna...

1905
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:00,510
Guys, I...

1906
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:02,470
Guys, come on, guys.

1907
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:06,930
Guys, I'm not playing this solo, guys.

1908
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:10,190
I'm not playing this solo.

1909
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,530
There's no way.

1910
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:13,370
Alright.

1911
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,430
Funzo, you must know what you're doing.

1912
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:17,150
Look at this nerd.

1913
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:18,690
He's all alone.

1914
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:20,070
What a loner.

1915
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:20,890
Couldn't be me.

1916
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:21,630
Wait.

1917
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:22,390
Wait.

1918
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:22,710
Wait.

1919
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:27,730
Look at this.

1920
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:29,010
Oh, he has a buddy now.

1921
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:31,410
He has a buddy now.

1922
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:36,950
It's okay.

1923
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:37,630
It's okay.

1924
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:38,230
He came back.

1925
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:39,810
He came back, chat.

1926
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:42,310
He came back.

1927
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:45,770
Okay.

1928
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:50,610
I think, honestly, I definitely did the best with SwordGuy.

1929
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:54,130
SwordGuy was definitely, like, my best one.

1930
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:54,810
Ooh.

1931
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:56,450
No, I wanna be blue.

1932
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:57,730
We're team blue.

1933
01:12:57,730 --> 01:12:57,930
We're team blue.

1934
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:01,250
Alright.

1935
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:02,130
I believe.

1936
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:03,070
This is it.

1937
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:03,450
This is it.

1938
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:04,050
This is where we win.

1939
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:09,170
He was the...

1940
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:11,490
This was the character where I actually clutched it.

1941
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:16,630
This was the character where I actually clutched the 1v2.

1942
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:17,750
So, I believe.

1943
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:19,630
I believe in this.

1944
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:24,810
Alright.

1945
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:26,930
Alright, Darius.

1946
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:29,250
I need you to tag in.

1947
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:30,790
I need you to tag in.

1948
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:31,630
Oh, that song.

1949
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:37,370
Yeah, his rate...

1950
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:39,730
I mean, I literally won my first round with him.

1951
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:44,290
The very first round I won was with... literally with this guy.

1952
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:46,590
So, I'm gonna be a miss...

1953
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:47,410
What the fuck?

1954
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:48,170
Okay.

1955
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:50,110
Yay.

1956
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:51,330
I did my job.

1957
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:56,710
Don't worry.

1958
01:13:56,810 --> 01:13:58,470
In 2 seconds, I can help you again.

1959
01:13:58,910 --> 01:13:59,570
Watch this.

1960
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:01,870
Boom!

1961
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:02,530
You're welcome!

1962
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:05,390
Wait, tag me in!

1963
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:06,090
Tag me in!

1964
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:07,130
Tag me in, tag me in!

1965
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:07,730
Tag me in!

1966
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:08,330
Tag me in!

1967
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:08,790
Tag me in!

1968
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:09,370
Tag me in!

1969
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:10,170
Tag me in!

1970
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:10,730
Tag me in!

1971
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:12,190
Tag me in!

1972
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:13,450
Yeah!

1973
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:15,450
Wait, wait, wait.

1974
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:16,470
I'm joking.

1975
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:18,770
Yeah!

1976
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:19,690
I did it!

1977
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:21,910
I did it!

1978
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:23,910
Your turn.

1979
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:35,490
Okay,

1980
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:41,970
don't worry.

1981
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:42,450
I got you.

1982
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:43,510
Boom!

1983
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:45,870
I did the thing.

1984
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:49,170
Wait, tag me in!

1985
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:51,730
Wait, no!

1986
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:52,710
Is that gonna kill him?

1987
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:00,760
I did it.

1988
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:11,250
Your turn.

1989
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:17,110
Oh my god, I'm so good.

1990
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:18,410
Bro!

1991
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:18,950
Bro!

1992
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:20,250
I need to get in here!

1993
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:21,630
Get in here!

1994
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:22,090
Get in here!

1995
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:27,930
Guys, I did it, guys!

1996
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:30,850
It's not kill-stealing!

1997
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,410
We literally worked together!

1998
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:37,950
It is the yesterday of all time.

1999
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:39,650
Oh, me!

2000
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:42,710
Don't worry, I got you in two seconds.

2001
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:45,610
Oh no.

2002
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:47,850
Don't worry, I'm coming over to help you.

2003
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:49,570
I think I did it.

2004
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:51,490
Oh shit!

2005
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:52,470
Wait, tag me in!

2006
01:15:52,530 --> 01:15:52,830
Tag me in!

2007
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:54,510
No!

2008
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:56,070
Don't worry, there's still hope.

2009
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:57,510
Don't worry, I got you.

2010
01:15:57,550 --> 01:15:57,990
I got you.

2011
01:15:58,610 --> 01:15:59,370
I got you!

2012
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:00,070
Wait.

2013
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:01,470
Oh.

2014
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:03,730
It's okay.

2015
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:04,270
No!

2016
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:10,750
I died purpose- Oh no!

2017
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:14,870
Bro, why did you tag me in?

2018
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:15,750
Bro!

2019
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:18,730
Bro, why did you tag me in?

2020
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:18,970
Bro!

2021
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:20,210
I wasn't ready!

2022
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:23,070
I wasn't ready!

2023
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:26,970
Bro!

2024
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:31,550
You gotta, like, warn me first before you tag me in!

2025
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:33,770
Like, I wasn't ready!

2026
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:36,350
Actually, bro.

2027
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:38,410
What are you talking about?

2028
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:41,390
I am doing my best, dude.

2029
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:42,230
Oh shit!

2030
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:43,430
I did not mean to do that!

2031
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:48,190
Oh shit!

2032
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:48,770
Sorry, bro!

2033
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:54,750
Bro, that was an accident!

2034
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:55,710
That was an accident!

2035
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:56,510
I'm sorry, man!

2036
01:16:58,510 --> 01:16:59,610
Oh shit, he missed.

2037
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:02,570
Wait, what?

2038
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:02,950
No!

2039
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:04,050
No!

2040
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:06,230
Bro, what happened?

2041
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:09,130
Bro, what's going on, bro?

2042
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:11,970
Bro, did they adapt it?

2043
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:15,550
Guys, do you think I threw there?

2044
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:16,730
No, right?

2045
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:17,770
It's my teammate's fault.

2046
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:19,550
He did not warn me before-

2047
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:24,110
It's not me, right?

2048
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:25,550
Nah, that can't be me.

2049
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:28,210
See?

2050
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:30,670
I did that.

2051
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:33,610
Oh shit!

2052
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:34,370
Oh fuck!

2053
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:35,830
Okay.

2054
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:37,690
What the fuck?

2055
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:40,370
What did I do?

2056
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:43,490
I don't even know what did I do.

2057
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:47,590
What the fuck did I- What he- Yes!

2058
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:48,770
No!

2059
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:49,330
I died!

2060
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:55,390
The Metroid League experience.

2061
01:17:57,370 --> 01:18:00,110
I don't know about you guys, but I got the two kills myself.

2062
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:02,390
Like, it can't be me, right?

2063
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:02,750
No.

2064
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:02,990
No.

2065
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:04,190
No.

2066
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:06,030
No, I did my part.

2067
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:07,650
I'm pretty sure.

2068
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:12,850
It's- It's my team's fault.

2069
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:18,650
I wasn't even ready!

2070
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:22,230
Like, he tagged me in when I wasn't even ready!

2071
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:25,710
I was not prepared to be tagged in there.

2072
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:28,710
I- I was not ready.

2073
01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:35,430
Like, all I'm saying was that I didn't have time!

2074
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:36,970
Alright.

2075
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:38,810
It's okay.

2076
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:39,990
This is it.

2077
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:41,630
This is a new dream duo.

2078
01:18:42,670 --> 01:18:43,830
It is!

2079
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:46,490
I wasn't ready!

2080
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:51,750
He didn't give me like- He didn't- He didn't give me like a- You know what?

2081
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:52,330
Maybe Ahri.

2082
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:54,430
Okay, I'm gonna be Ahri.

2083
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:56,070
Alright.

2084
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:59,430
Like, I need like- I need like a warning.

2085
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:00,230
You know?

2086
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:01,290
Like a five second warning.

2087
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:04,070
Whenever I'm tagged in.

2088
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:09,910
It's- How am I throwing?

2089
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:11,410
I don't understand.

2090
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:12,830
How was I throwing?

2091
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:16,190
I got my- I got my- I got my twos.

2092
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:17,910
I even got my twos.

2093
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:19,190
I didn't even need a one.

2094
01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:22,030
Okay, nice.

2095
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:23,090
Okay, we can skip that.

2096
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:23,590
Thank god.

2097
01:19:23,850 --> 01:19:24,710
I was gonna say.

2098
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:26,690
Oh, shit.

2099
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:27,790
Wait, he knows what he's doing.

2100
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:30,890
Okay, no, I got hit.

2101
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:31,830
Nevermind.

2102
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:33,530
What the fuck?

2103
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:33,950
Which one?

2104
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:35,230
Nice.

2105
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:35,770
I did it.

2106
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,310
What the fuck?

2107
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:38,930
You can do that?

2108
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:42,450
Okay, don't worry.

2109
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:42,910
I got you.

2110
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:45,070
I got you.

2111
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:47,170
Where am I?

2112
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:48,530
Don't worry.

2113
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:49,770
I'm right here.

2114
01:19:53,210 --> 01:19:53,930
Holy shit.

2115
01:19:56,370 --> 01:19:58,130
Oh my god, that throw is insane.

2116
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:00,430
Okay, I got hit.

2117
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,470
Why did you call me in?

2118
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:03,250
Bro, why-

2119
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:08,270
Tyrius.

2120
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:09,530
Tyrius.

2121
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:11,450
Why are you taking so much damage?

2122
01:20:12,010 --> 01:20:12,450
Tyrius.

2123
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,010
Tyrius, no!

2124
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:20,570
Oh my god.

2125
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:24,310
Oh, this is not fair.

2126
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:26,990
Bro, what?

2127
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:28,890
What did he do?

2128
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:31,590
What the fuck was that?

2129
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:39,310
Holy shit, what did I do?

2130
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:43,030
That was so much damage.

2131
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:47,570
Oh my god, but I almost clutched it.

2132
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:52,210
I don't know what I did, but I almost clutched it there.

2133
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:54,410
Don't worry, I got you.

2134
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:56,110
I did!

2135
01:20:59,110 --> 01:21:00,770
I can still win.

2136
01:21:02,210 --> 01:21:04,030
Yes, they didn't expect it!

2137
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:07,510
Don't worry, I can do this again.

2138
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,490
They'll never expect it again.

2139
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:13,750
But will they expect it again?

2140
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:17,050
No, they never expect it!

2141
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:20,250
Let's go.

2142
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:24,150
Oh no, it's a...

2143
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:24,970
It's a Yasuo.

2144
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:27,890
That's right, you didn't expect that either.

2145
01:21:31,690 --> 01:21:32,890
What do you mean?

2146
01:21:32,950 --> 01:21:33,510
I helped!

2147
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:36,450
Darius, please.

2148
01:21:36,770 --> 01:21:37,970
I don't want to fight him.

2149
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:39,110
Darius, please.

2150
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:42,230
Darius, please.

2151
01:21:43,210 --> 01:21:44,630
Holy shit, Darius.

2152
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:46,410
Don't worry, I got you.

2153
01:21:47,690 --> 01:21:50,130
Wait, I have to fight Darius.

2154
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:51,030
Why did you fight me?

2155
01:21:52,670 --> 01:21:54,490
Darius, no, I don't want to fight this.

2156
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:58,390
Oh, thank God.

2157
01:21:59,010 --> 01:22:01,110
Why did he put me back in?

2158
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:05,130
Holy shit, I got you.

2159
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:06,230
Yes!

2160
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:07,650
I did it.

2161
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:08,550
I know.

2162
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,700
He like, chucked me into the fight.

2163
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,780
I was watching.

2164
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:18,620
All right.

2165
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,760
I didn't expect that, did you?

2166
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:22,240
That's right.

2167
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:22,380
That's right.

2168
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:24,520
Watch this.

2169
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,020
You didn't expect this either.

2170
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:26,920
Well, where am I?

2171
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:29,240
All right.

2172
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:30,800
Don't worry.

2173
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:33,640
That's right.

2174
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:37,260
Oh, thank God.

2175
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:39,480
Wait, no!

2176
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:42,460
Wait, does that hit me?

2177
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:46,480
What the fuck?

2178
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:48,820
Oh, shit.

2179
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:50,280
There's this.

2180
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:51,000
No!

2181
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,300
Oh, shit.

2182
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:52,360
Oh, shit.

2183
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:53,820
Oh, no!

2184
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:55,540
Oh, no!

2185
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:57,180
Oh, no!

2186
01:22:58,420 --> 01:22:59,120
Okay, don't worry.

2187
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:00,580
Don't worry.

2188
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:01,860
I don't know what I'm doing, but don't worry.

2189
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,460
Do you think they know I don't know what I'm doing?

2190
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:08,420
Shit.

2191
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:10,360
I think they do.

2192
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:12,540
I think they do.

2193
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:14,660
I think...

2194
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:15,220
Whoa!

2195
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:16,720
I...

2196
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:16,860
I...

2197
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:20,160
Please.

2198
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,260
Come on.

2199
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:23,920
Oh, oh no.

2200
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:24,960
Did I block it?

2201
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,240
Yes, I did.

2202
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:28,180
No!

2203
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:29,780
I could have...

2204
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:33,970
Please.

2205
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:37,430
We have to win at least one game.

2206
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:43,010
We only win one round.

2207
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:46,590
There has to be one person.

2208
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:52,870
There has to be one person.

2209
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:56,150
There's no way!

2210
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:59,410
Are you... Oh no, this is training.

2211
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:02,150
Guys, there has to be one.

2212
01:24:02,850 --> 01:24:05,390
There has to be at least one person.

2213
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:09,010
One team.

2214
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:13,010
Oh my god, wait.

2215
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:13,510
Is it this?

2216
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:14,570
Join cabinet queue.

2217
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:15,490
No, that's the queue.

2218
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:18,650
Oh my god, all the... all of his phone!

2219
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:20,150
Wait, no, no, no.

2220
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:20,890
There's one here.

2221
01:24:21,870 --> 01:24:23,570
Have we played with Lecce before?

2222
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:25,330
Hey guys, we need two here.

2223
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:28,210
Who doesn't know what they're doing?

2224
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:29,090
Ideally.

2225
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,850
Why did I get tagged in everyone else?

2226
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:34,610
Alright,

2227
01:24:38,330 --> 01:24:39,070
I'll be the Yasu.

2228
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:40,590
That's right.

2229
01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:42,090
No Yasu for you.

2230
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:45,490
Alright.

2231
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:46,630
This is fine.

2232
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:47,250
This is fine.

2233
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:48,130
This is fine.

2234
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:50,610
There's no way.

2235
01:24:50,810 --> 01:24:51,670
I'm Yasu.

2236
01:24:51,710 --> 01:24:53,590
Yasu is clutch.

2237
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:56,690
Yasu is clutch.

2238
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:00,770
There's no way.

2239
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:03,790
This is the... This is it.

2240
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:04,470
This is the game.

2241
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:05,210
This is it.

2242
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:09,130
How do we skip the... Oh, there it is.

2243
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:10,810
Okay, I really... Okay.

2244
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:12,650
Is that me?

2245
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:20,610
Oops.

2246
01:25:28,850 --> 01:25:30,550
I get the li...

2247
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:36,010
I did it!

2248
01:25:36,770 --> 01:25:37,330
Woo!

2249
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:44,130
Oh my god, I did it!

2250
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:46,190
It's like Pokémon.

2251
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:47,510
I summoned him in.

2252
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:49,210
And then I did the thing.

2253
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:51,510
Don't worry, I got you.

2254
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:55,390
Oops, the fuck you mean?

2255
01:25:55,610 --> 01:25:55,930
Oops.

2256
01:25:56,710 --> 01:25:57,510
What do you mean?

2257
01:25:57,690 --> 01:25:58,790
I did my job.

2258
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:01,190
That's right.

2259
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:02,950
Did not expect that, did ya?

2260
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,470
Don't worry, in two seconds.

2261
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:06,970
You wouldn't expect this.

2262
01:26:07,090 --> 01:26:08,090
Okay, he expected it.

2263
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:09,850
I shouldn't have telegraphed that.

2264
01:26:10,190 --> 01:26:10,710
I...

2265
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:16,950
Okay.

2266
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:17,730
I'll be ready, I swear!

2267
01:26:18,490 --> 01:26:19,350
Oh, okay.

2268
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:20,070
That's fine.

2269
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:20,710
That's fine.

2270
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:25,190
I didn't get to see me.

2271
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:26,950
Don't worry.

2272
01:26:32,110 --> 01:26:33,150
That's fuck you, right?

2273
01:26:33,190 --> 01:26:34,150
You didn't ever expect that.

2274
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:36,870
Oh my god!

2275
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:38,470
Wait, I think I'm gonna win!

2276
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:40,430
Wait.

2277
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:40,870
No!

2278
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:44,590
Oh, wait.

2279
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:45,630
Okay, don't worry.

2280
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:47,370
Oh, no!

2281
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:48,370
I took damage!

2282
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:49,530
Why did you let him hit me?

2283
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:51,570
Oh, no.

2284
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:52,350
Guys.

2285
01:26:52,770 --> 01:26:53,990
Guys, I think I jinxed it.

2286
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:56,710
I think I jinxed it, guys.

2287
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:57,930
No, no, no.

2288
01:26:58,030 --> 01:26:58,670
No, this is it.

2289
01:26:58,730 --> 01:26:58,950
This is it.

2290
01:26:59,010 --> 01:26:59,310
This is good.

2291
01:26:59,390 --> 01:26:59,690
This is good.

2292
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:00,710
This is good.

2293
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:02,630
And then...

2294
01:27:04,210 --> 01:27:05,610
And then he'll never expect it.

2295
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:06,630
Oh, oh, oh!

2296
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:07,810
No, Ahri!

2297
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:08,090
No!

2298
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:10,390
Don't worry, I got you, Ahri!

2299
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:13,130
They're on!

2300
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:14,150
They're on!

2301
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:16,350
Wait, we did it!

2302
01:27:18,510 --> 01:27:19,050
Don't worry.

2303
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:19,830
I got you.

2304
01:27:21,330 --> 01:27:22,490
They never expect that.

2305
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:26,630
And I'm gonna do it again in two seconds.

2306
01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:27,110
Oh!

2307
01:27:29,650 --> 01:27:31,990
It's okay, I... I'll finish the job.

2308
01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:33,590
Oh, wait.

2309
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:34,930
Wait, he has not take...

2310
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:36,630
Don't worry, I have not taken any damage.

2311
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:37,910
I will finish the job.

2312
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:39,870
Oh.

2313
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:40,310
Oh.

2314
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:41,150
Oh.

2315
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:43,590
Oh.

2316
01:27:43,710 --> 01:27:44,770
Yeah, I got you!

2317
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:45,950
Oh,

2318
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:50,260
shit!

2319
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:52,540
What did I do?

2320
01:27:59,790 --> 01:28:00,330
Wait.

2321
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:01,970
Did I just do it?

2322
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:03,250
What did I do?

2323
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:05,250
What the fuck did I do?

2324
01:28:05,650 --> 01:28:06,190
Wait.

2325
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:06,910
Wait.

2326
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:07,810
Wait.

2327
01:28:08,270 --> 01:28:12,210
I did it.

2328
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:12,910
Yeah.

2329
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:13,750
You see that?

2330
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:15,650
Yeah.

2331
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:17,610
That's right.

2332
01:28:20,010 --> 01:28:20,550
Yeah.

2333
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:22,650
I'm a gamer.

2334
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:26,070
I don't even know what...

2335
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:27,990
I comboed into a...

2336
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:29,410
Yeah, I did that.

2337
01:28:30,130 --> 01:28:31,650
I planned it all along.

2338
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:34,470
I put you guys in a false sense of security.

2339
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:39,170
Yeah.

2340
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:43,010
I can't believe you guys thought I did it.

2341
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:44,210
I was just button mashing.

2342
01:28:44,910 --> 01:28:47,570
How... How could I button mash into that?

2343
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:57,870
I don't know if you guys know this, but I am a Sajam Slam champion on my very first FGC tournament.

2344
01:29:06,010 --> 01:29:07,030
Oh, my God.

2345
01:29:07,070 --> 01:29:07,170
Wait.

2346
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:08,130
She's emo, too.

2347
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:10,770
Oh, wait.

2348
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:11,570
I don't want to see this.

2349
01:29:13,930 --> 01:29:15,530
How did I skip the cutscene?

2350
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:17,150
I don't like the cutscene for it.

2351
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:18,290
Don't worry.

2352
01:29:18,370 --> 01:29:18,750
I got you.

2353
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:21,630
That's right.

2354
01:29:22,330 --> 01:29:23,050
Oh, shit.

2355
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:23,910
Oh, shit.

2356
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:24,670
This is not what I wanted.

2357
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:25,350
Oh, shit.

2358
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:26,850
Stop.

2359
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:30,730
So, yeah.

2360
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:34,530
With the power of teamwork, we got this.

2361
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:37,650
T-bag.

2362
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:40,810
Of course, the T-bag.

2363
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:41,750
Wait.

2364
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:42,030
Where am I?

2365
01:29:43,490 --> 01:29:44,490
That's fucking right.

2366
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,390
You didn't expect me, did you?

2367
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:48,170
You thought I was going to do it on cooldown.

2368
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:50,430
Because you're damn right I am.

2369
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:53,250
Wait.

2370
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:54,010
Tag me in.

2371
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:54,430
Tag me in.

2372
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:55,010
Tag me in.

2373
01:29:55,970 --> 01:29:56,530
Tag me in.

2374
01:29:58,170 --> 01:29:58,850
Tag me in.

2375
01:29:58,930 --> 01:29:59,290
Tag me in.

2376
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:02,290
Come on.

2377
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:07,090
That's fucking right.

2378
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:07,730
Oh, shit.

2379
01:30:10,090 --> 01:30:10,810
That's fucking right.

2380
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:11,550
You can't jump for it.

2381
01:30:13,990 --> 01:30:14,830
That's fucking right.

2382
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:18,050
You thought... That's right.

2383
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:20,430
Oh, you thought you could do it?

2384
01:30:20,530 --> 01:30:22,150
You thought you could just tag in?

2385
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:23,930
That's right.

2386
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:24,810
Because you can.

2387
01:30:30,770 --> 01:30:31,690
So easy.

2388
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:36,190
So fucking easy.

2389
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:37,390
Wait.

2390
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:37,970
Tag me in.

2391
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:38,370
Tag me in.

2392
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:39,970
Tag me in.

2393
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:40,290
Let me in.

2394
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:40,490
Let me in.

2395
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:41,410
Wait.

2396
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:41,910
No.

2397
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:41,950
No.

2398
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:45,950
Wait.

2399
01:30:46,030 --> 01:30:46,070
Wait.

2400
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:46,210
Wait.

2401
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:46,970
I want to finish it.

2402
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:47,750
I want to finish it.

2403
01:30:47,830 --> 01:30:48,170
Alright.

2404
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:48,570
Please.

2405
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:49,150
Yeah.

2406
01:30:50,970 --> 01:30:51,390
Wait.

2407
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:58,470
That's right.

2408
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:00,210
We're...

2409
01:31:01,390 --> 01:31:02,530
We're the power duo.

2410
01:31:04,530 --> 01:31:05,870
Thank you for hopping in.

2411
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:09,250
Yeah.

2412
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:13,950
That's the little sister experience.

2413
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:17,210
Don't worry.

2414
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:17,710
I got you.

2415
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:19,370
They blocked it.

2416
01:31:19,530 --> 01:31:20,270
But I tried.

2417
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:21,350
That's all that matters.

2418
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:22,590
Alright.

2419
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:23,710
Don't worry.

2420
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:24,530
I got you again.

2421
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:25,430
Yeah.

2422
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:26,770
He blocked it.

2423
01:31:26,810 --> 01:31:27,290
But that's okay.

2424
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:28,390
It's the effort that counted.

2425
01:31:29,790 --> 01:31:30,210
Wait.

2426
01:31:31,530 --> 01:31:31,810
No.

2427
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:32,890
You're not supposed to take damage.

2428
01:31:33,110 --> 01:31:33,450
Ari.

2429
01:31:33,610 --> 01:31:34,350
What the fuck?

2430
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:36,130
What's going on, Ari?

2431
01:31:36,970 --> 01:31:37,930
What the fuck, Ari?

2432
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:38,610
You got me hit.

2433
01:31:40,510 --> 01:31:41,910
Did they adapt?

2434
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:43,150
That's not fair.

2435
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:44,830
Fighting game players.

2436
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:45,230
What?

2437
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:48,150
Fighting game players should not be adapting?

2438
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:52,730
What do you mean they adapted?

2439
01:31:55,130 --> 01:31:56,610
What do you mean?

2440
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:58,410
That should not be a thing.

2441
01:32:02,570 --> 01:32:03,270
Oh, God.

2442
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:04,110
Oh, God.

2443
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:05,890
Oh, my God.

2444
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:06,950
He knows what he's doing.

2445
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:08,430
Oh.

2446
01:32:08,790 --> 01:32:09,650
He's doing those.

2447
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:12,750
He's doing those and everything.

2448
01:32:14,370 --> 01:32:15,070
Oh, my God.

2449
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:18,310
That's fucking right.

2450
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:19,610
Oh.

2451
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:20,770
What the fuck did I do?

2452
01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:21,870
I'll never know.

2453
01:32:22,730 --> 01:32:23,690
Did I do the same thing?

2454
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:24,310
Oh.

2455
01:32:25,490 --> 01:32:25,850
No.

2456
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:28,770
I just want to make it close, you know?

2457
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:31,250
I'm just trying to make the game closer.

2458
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:33,630
You know what?

2459
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:34,730
I feel confident.

2460
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:37,230
Ooh.

2461
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:38,330
I was surprised.

2462
01:32:38,990 --> 01:32:40,310
Oh, you thought I was going to swap?

2463
01:32:40,510 --> 01:32:41,230
That's fucking right.

2464
01:32:41,290 --> 01:32:41,590
I'm not.

2465
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:43,970
Because I am now.

2466
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:52,950
Yeah, you thought I was going to swap it on the first try.

2467
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:54,790
No, I'm swapping it.

2468
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:55,830
I'm switching things up.

2469
01:32:56,770 --> 01:32:57,550
Oh, shit.

2470
01:32:57,710 --> 01:33:00,090
I'm not a... What the fuck is this combo?

2471
01:33:00,590 --> 01:33:01,030
Oh.

2472
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:02,990
I can help you soon.

2473
01:33:03,470 --> 01:33:03,910
Oh.

2474
01:33:04,650 --> 01:33:05,230
Don't worry.

2475
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:06,030
I can help you soon.

2476
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:13,440
I surprised the teammate.

2477
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:18,180
Oh.

2478
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:21,080
Yeah?

2479
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:22,960
I can surprise you too.

2480
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:24,440
Oh.

2481
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:26,240
That's right.

2482
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:27,100
The wind is here.

2483
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:29,520
I don't know what that does, but it's here.

2484
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:31,800
That's fucking right.

2485
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:34,860
Alright.

2486
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:35,780
Any moment now.

2487
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:37,640
The combo is going to end, right?

2488
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:40,200
Oh.

2489
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:42,420
Oh, no.

2490
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:43,760
Oh, no.

2491
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:45,020
Ahri, no.

2492
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:46,500
I got you.

2493
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:48,520
He blocked it.

2494
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:49,640
Please, Ahri.

2495
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:50,220
You can't die.

2496
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:53,280
That's right.

2497
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:54,300
I got you.

2498
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:54,580
Wait.

2499
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:54,900
What?

2500
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:56,860
Wait.

2501
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:57,400
Wait.

2502
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:58,940
You didn't warn me.

2503
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,600
You didn't warn me that I was going to do this.

2504
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:05,560
I did it.

2505
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:06,600
That's okay.

2506
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:07,600
But I did it.

2507
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:08,620
Okay.

2508
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:09,560
But he's so good.

2509
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:09,980
Oh.

2510
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:12,080
No.

2511
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:15,580
Oh, no.

2512
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:16,720
It's okay.

2513
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:18,820
Oh, shit.

2514
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:21,080
No.

2515
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:24,440
Ahri, you didn't do anything.

2516
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:25,360
Why are you giving me a kiss?

2517
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:28,980
Yes.

2518
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:30,020
Oh.

2519
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:34,400
Oh.

2520
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:34,600
Oh.

2521
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:35,820
Oh.

2522
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:35,900
Oh.

2523
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:36,160
Oh.

2524
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:46,420
I got you.

2525
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:57,840
There you go.

2526
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:58,380
God.

2527
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:00,740
I don't know.

2528
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:01,720
So, I'm fine.

2529
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:02,620
I just wanted to say I was scared.

2530
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:03,180
I have a whiteico to.

2531
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:04,920
I do not.

2532
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:19,440
I thought you guys are... I thought you guys are FGC players.

2533
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:22,920
You're really letting an FPS gamer beat you?

2534
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,960
Reported for toxicity.

2535
01:35:43,810 --> 01:35:45,450
What did you do?

2536
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:48,830
Why did you boost your ego, Ethan?

2537
01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:49,410
Why?

2538
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:53,450
Go to an actual lobby.

2539
01:35:56,770 --> 01:35:59,650
There's nobody in the actual lobby.

2540
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:00,470
What do you mean?

2541
01:36:01,050 --> 01:36:02,030
Alright, your turn.

2542
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:06,550
I tried!

2543
01:36:10,730 --> 01:36:11,270
I tried!

2544
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:11,510
Don't worry.

2545
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:12,570
I'm here!

2546
01:36:13,150 --> 01:36:14,250
I did the thing!

2547
01:36:15,210 --> 01:36:18,210
Oh my god, how far is our win streak though?

2548
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:20,090
Oh shit.

2549
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:24,650
Maybe you should get a hit in first, bro.

2550
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:26,870
That's fucking right.

2551
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:32,230
Wow.

2552
01:36:32,230 --> 01:36:32,710
Hachi!

2553
01:36:33,790 --> 01:36:35,950
Bro, that's a little embarrassing, bro.

2554
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:38,870
Okay, wait, wait, wait a minute.

2555
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:40,650
Wait, wait.

2556
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:42,030
Wait a minute, wait.

2557
01:36:42,210 --> 01:36:43,870
We didn't mean that, Braum.

2558
01:36:44,050 --> 01:36:44,590
We didn't.

2559
01:36:44,710 --> 01:36:45,870
Hachi, I didn't mean that.

2560
01:36:45,910 --> 01:36:46,450
Hachi, please!

2561
01:36:46,770 --> 01:36:47,490
Hachi, please!

2562
01:36:47,930 --> 01:36:50,130
I didn't mean that, Hachi!

2563
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:52,410
Oh my god.

2564
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:54,290
Oh god.

2565
01:36:54,930 --> 01:36:55,670
Oh, that's fine.

2566
01:36:56,770 --> 01:36:57,210
Oh.

2567
01:36:57,530 --> 01:36:58,770
He's running away.

2568
01:37:00,210 --> 01:37:00,830
That's fine.

2569
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:02,790
It doesn't matter if you run away.

2570
01:37:04,490 --> 01:37:05,450
That's fucking right.

2571
01:37:05,950 --> 01:37:07,490
You're trying to try and keep running?

2572
01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:10,870
Maybe you should stop running away.

2573
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:13,190
Oh, did I dodge it?

2574
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:13,730
Wait, what?

2575
01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:14,570
I didn't block?

2576
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:17,490
How did I not block that?

2577
01:37:20,350 --> 01:37:20,870
Okay.

2578
01:37:21,610 --> 01:37:22,550
That's fucking right.

2579
01:37:23,690 --> 01:37:24,610
Oh, what?

2580
01:37:24,650 --> 01:37:25,270
You're still alive?

2581
01:37:25,330 --> 01:37:26,010
I killed you.

2582
01:37:27,330 --> 01:37:29,210
Oh no, my teammate killed you.

2583
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:31,970
My teammate killed you.

2584
01:37:32,110 --> 01:37:32,630
My teammate killed you.

2585
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:34,610
My teammate killed you.

2586
01:37:34,610 --> 01:37:35,870
My teammate killed you.

2587
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:38,630
So easy.

2588
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:40,910
So easy.

2589
01:37:41,970 --> 01:37:43,030
That's fucking right.

2590
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:46,350
Oh, didn't expect that swapper-ooney, right?

2591
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:48,170
That's fucking right.

2592
01:37:48,430 --> 01:37:50,770
I hit you and then I swap.

2593
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:53,650
The craziest fucking switch up ever.

2594
01:37:54,330 --> 01:37:56,590
And then I'm going to join in on the fight.

2595
01:38:02,290 --> 01:38:03,310
Swapper-ooney.

2596
01:38:03,410 --> 01:38:04,470
Swapper-ooney.

2597
01:38:04,610 --> 01:38:05,210
Swapper-ooney.

2598
01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:05,850
Swapper-ooney.

2599
01:38:08,170 --> 01:38:09,350
So fucking easy.

2600
01:38:09,410 --> 01:38:09,890
That's right!

2601
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:11,230
Oh, he jumped?!

2602
01:38:11,230 --> 01:38:13,270
How did she jump?!

2603
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:16,470
He knows how to jump?!

2604
01:38:16,470 --> 01:38:20,450
How is that possible?!

2605
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:22,670
Don't worry, I'm coming in!

2606
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:24,430
Easy.

2607
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:25,970
I did my part.

2608
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:28,950
Wait, tag me in!

2609
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:30,170
Tag me in, Ahri!

2610
01:38:30,730 --> 01:38:32,390
Tag me in, I can solo him!

2611
01:38:32,630 --> 01:38:33,250
Tag me in!

2612
01:38:34,170 --> 01:38:35,790
Tag me in, I can solo him!

2613
01:38:36,850 --> 01:38:37,610
Put me in!

2614
01:38:37,650 --> 01:38:38,370
Put me in, coach!

2615
01:38:38,850 --> 01:38:39,870
Coach, put me in!

2616
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:41,590
That's fucking right!

2617
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:43,710
Oh shit!

2618
01:38:43,810 --> 01:38:45,890
Oh, wait, why did you tag me in?!

2619
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:50,290
Wait, wait, I didn't mean it!

2620
01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:52,010
I didn't mean it, I was joking!

2621
01:38:54,190 --> 01:38:54,630
Jk.

2622
01:38:54,910 --> 01:38:55,750
Oh shit!

2623
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:56,370
Wait!

2624
01:38:58,610 --> 01:39:00,070
Wait, wait, wait!

2625
01:39:00,270 --> 01:39:01,090
I went out!

2626
01:39:01,150 --> 01:39:01,390
No!

2627
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:08,420
Why did you tag me in?!

2628
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:11,480
You know exactly what was gonna happen!

2629
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:12,880
It's alright.

2630
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:17,640
I think, like, I was clutching too much chat.

2631
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:21,140
Rance broken.

2632
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:26,220
Wow, another win?

2633
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:31,700
Guys, fighting games are so easy.

2634
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:41,780
Oh my god, the streak goes on.

2635
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,960
Bro, can nobody defeat us?

2636
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:55,660
I don't know, it feels like nobody can defeat us at this rate.

2637
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,040
Hahaha!

2638
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:05,560
He's growing smugger by the second.

2639
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:11,700
What do you mean combo stealing?

2640
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:14,580
That's right, I blocked that.

2641
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:15,340
Oh shit.

2642
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:16,720
Wait, you got hit?

2643
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:17,740
Wait, wait!

2644
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,320
Wait, I'm getting hit more than once!

2645
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:22,920
Wait, this is not how- Wait, Ari!

2646
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:25,440
Ari!

2647
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:25,600
Ari!

2648
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:26,980
Ari!

2649
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:27,880
Ari!

2650
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:34,240
This person actually knows what he's doing!

2651
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:35,620
I'm getting hit!

2652
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:45,540
This guy actually knows what he's doing!

2653
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:52,060
What was that?

2654
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,400
How did you know?

2655
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:59,180
Holy shit, how does he know two different characters?

2656
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:02,800
Holy shit, how does he know two different characters?

2657
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:04,000
Oh no!

2658
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,320
I still got hit!

2659
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:08,620
Who's my Ari?

2660
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:10,060
They all look the same!

2661
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:12,640
Who's my Ari?

2662
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:13,200
They all look the same!

2663
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:13,760
Oh my god.

2664
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:17,120
Who let this real fighting game player into my lobby?

2665
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:21,440
Oh my god.

2666
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:21,440
Who let this real fighting game player into my lobby?

2667
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:23,580
Wait, why did I not- Ari!

2668
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:25,500
Why did you swap with me?

2669
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:28,900
Oh, thank god!

2670
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:30,460
Your turn!

2671
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:33,760
Damn, Zoki, you sure blocked that so good.

2672
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:37,020
Your face really makes for a good shield.

2673
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:37,720
Your face really makes for a good shield.

2674
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:38,300
It's alright now.

2675
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:41,880
Okay, if I lost, it's not because of me.

2676
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:43,120
Oh my god, wait!

2677
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:45,220
My person is doing all these combos!

2678
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:48,360
Oh, I think this guy is an echo player.

2679
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:49,480
Oh, I think this guy is an echo player.

2680
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:52,360
This guy is so good, holy sh- Oh my god!

2681
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:54,340
I can't face tech that hard.

2682
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:55,960
Holy shit.

2683
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:57,760
That's fucking right.

2684
01:41:58,420 --> 01:41:59,440
Win time!

2685
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:03,540
I don't know what to do with it, but- No!

2686
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:09,360
Ari!

2687
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:11,440
I was not meant to do this!

2688
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:12,840
Ari!

2689
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:13,900
No!

2690
01:42:17,620 --> 01:42:18,140
Ari!

2691
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,180
How am I supposed to clutch this?

2692
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:22,020
Oh, he's through!

2693
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:25,800
No!

2694
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:28,520
My win streak!

2695
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:31,820
No!

2696
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:39,720
We got 1v2!

2697
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:47,520
I can't believe it!

2698
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,280
The evil- has been defeated!

2699
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:54,540
No!

2700
01:42:55,180 --> 01:42:55,900
No!

2701
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:00,760
I should have unplugged this man's controller!

2702
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,020
Who is he?

2703
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:05,040
Who is he?

2704
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:09,060
Who is he?

2705
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:11,640
I can't believe it!

2706
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:11,980
Alright.

2707
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:17,460
Before we call it, I wanna watch some of you drag- Alright, who's the strongest dragoon here?

2708
01:43:17,820 --> 01:43:20,080
Who's the strongest FGC fighter?

2709
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:20,380
Who's the strongest FGC fighter here?

2710
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:24,760
I wanna see the best FGC fighter fight.

2711
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:25,880
I wanna see the best FGC fighter fight.

2712
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:26,420
Who is it?

2713
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:28,300
Who is it?

2714
01:43:28,340 --> 01:43:31,100
If you're the best FGC fighter, you go to this lobby.

2715
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:32,760
The one in front of the big TV.

2716
01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:34,460
I wanna watch.

2717
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:38,980
I wanna watch Chaos Muffin versus Alan!

2718
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:42,020
Chaos Muffin versus Alan!

2719
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:43,820
Get in here!

2720
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,980
I see Alan get fucking shit on!

2721
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:50,660
Chaos Muffin, you- You should be over here!

2722
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:51,860
You too!

2723
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:53,420
Alright.

2724
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:57,080
Alan, that's not- Alan, get over here!

2725
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:58,880
Alan, get your ass over here!

2726
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:08,340
He'll destroy me so hard!

2727
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:11,180
Would no one fight Chaos Muffin?

2728
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:12,240
Would no one fight Chaos Muffin?

2729
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:13,840
Who will fight Chaos Muffin?

2730
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:15,520
Who will fight Chaos Muffin?

2731
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:17,880
Why are you all scared of him?

2732
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:19,700
You fucking cowards!

2733
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:24,400
If I get my ass beat by him, we all get our ass beat by him!

2734
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:31,740
We all get our ass beat by him!

2735
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:34,600
We all shall get our ass beat by Chaos Muffin!

2736
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:35,340
We all shall get our ass beat by Chaos Muffin!

2737
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:36,240
We all shall get our ass beat by Chaos Muffin!

2738
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:38,040
Okay.

2739
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:40,000
How do I watch this?

2740
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:41,460
Is this it?

2741
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:43,980
Okay.

2742
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:45,540
He's not joining.

2743
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:47,740
Does only the center cab have- Yeah.

2744
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:47,860
How do I watch this?

2745
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:48,600
How do we spectate?

2746
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:50,780
I wanna spectate this.

2747
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:54,100
I saw that guy in Minecraft once.

2748
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,060
How do we spectate?

2749
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:03,220
Anyway, I wanna spectate.

2750
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:05,220
Oh, you have to hop in the center?

2751
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:11,860
Wait, is it- How do I spec- How the fuck do I do this?

2752
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:14,580
Oh, it's this.

2753
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:15,020
Okay.

2754
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:16,880
Toggle size?

2755
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:17,500
It's loading.

2756
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:20,520
How do I toggle it?

2757
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:23,660
Oh, it's loading!

2758
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:25,460
Oh!

2759
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,660
How does it take you for every load?

2760
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:30,940
It's still loading!

2761
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:34,100
What the fuck?

2762
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,180
Guys, don't fight yet!

2763
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:35,760
Stand still!

2764
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:37,220
I'm joining.

2765
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:39,400
Guys!

2766
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:42,300
Guys, don't load in yet!

2767
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:47,320
I'm trying to- Oh, he hasn't joined.

2768
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:47,700
Okay.

2769
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:50,500
Okay, I was gonna say, everybody stand still.

2770
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:53,720
So I can watch the fight.

2771
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:55,720
So I can watch the fight.

2772
01:45:58,420 --> 01:45:58,980
Alright.

2773
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:02,020
Don't be broken.

2774
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:03,820
How can there be- Oh!

2775
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:04,760
Alright.

2776
01:46:06,620 --> 01:46:08,340
Oh, what the fuck?

2777
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,060
Can I make it fullscreen?

2778
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:11,240
Like this?

2779
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:11,720
Okay.

2780
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:14,000
Alright, zoom in.

2781
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,420
Which one's ChaosMuffin?

2782
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,420
Just the average YouTube stream.

2783
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:23,420
We're watching a stream of a stream right now.

2784
01:46:23,620 --> 01:46:27,080
We're- Wait, what?

2785
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:29,600
Where are they?

2786
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:30,500
Oh, it's like a cutscene!

2787
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:34,220
This is pretty funky.

2788
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:34,740
It is.

2789
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:37,360
It's like, you know, like the- Oh, sorry.

2790
01:46:37,460 --> 01:46:38,500
That's my other foamboard.

2791
01:46:38,780 --> 01:46:41,560
I need another sticker on this foamboard!

2792
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:42,140
It's not!

2793
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:43,060
It's not strong enough!

2794
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:47,520
Wait, which one's ChaosMuffin?

2795
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,920
Which one's ChaosMuffin?

2796
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:53,160
That's Blue's Clues.

2797
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:55,180
That's Alan.

2798
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:58,300
Is Chaos the Ahri?

2799
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:00,440
Oh!

2800
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:03,260
The one winning.

2801
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:06,900
Get fucking shit on Alan.

2802
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:12,920
Oh, shit!

2803
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:14,140
Chaos!

2804
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:17,120
T-Bag him!

2805
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:17,980
T-Bag him, Chaos!

2806
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:23,020
T-Bag him!

2807
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:24,500
Wait.

2808
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:27,240
Wait, Lecce, how come you couldn't do that?

2809
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,460
Wait, is Yasuo your main?

2810
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:30,120
Oops.

2811
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:34,500
Wait a minute.

2812
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:39,280
Why didn't you tell me Yasuo was your main if you could do all that?

2813
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:44,480
Lecce!

2814
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:46,060
Lecce!

2815
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:47,320
Why didn't you tell me?

2816
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:53,400
You mean to tell me I could've won even more?

2817
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:57,560
You kinda sublocked it.

2818
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:01,460
Is Yasuo one trick?

2819
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:05,200
Ooh, the mix.

2820
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:10,280
Report Doki for stealing his one trick.

2821
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:15,900
Holy shit!

2822
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:18,640
Holy shit!

2823
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:19,000
Holy shit!

2824
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:19,900
What the fuck?

2825
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:20,780
What the fuck?

2826
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:26,220
Oh!

2827
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:27,580
Damn!

2828
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:30,840
Wait, that shit was sick!

2829
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:36,140
That was such a cool super!

2830
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:36,620
That was such a cool super!

2831
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:37,040
That was such a cool super!

2832
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:40,000
Oh my god.

2833
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:40,440
Oh my god.

2834
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:42,720
I can't believe it.

2835
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:45,980
Wait, but Chaos Muppets got this!

2836
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:47,540
Oh, thank god.

2837
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:48,840
Okay, thank god.

2838
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:52,440
That's actually a super sick super.

2839
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:53,880
I really liked how that looked.

2840
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:59,960
Yeah, and it's alpha, so it can always improve too.

2841
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:03,240
The fact that this is alpha means it can always get better.

2842
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:04,860
That's the best part.

2843
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:10,300
I need to put more fucking stickies on my foam, my acrylic pad.

2844
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:10,820
Not acrylic.

2845
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:13,200
My acoustic panels, cause it keeps falling.

2846
01:49:15,100 --> 01:49:17,000
My acoustics is so loud.

2847
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:17,920
It keeps falling.

2848
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:25,530
Don't even let Alan...

2849
01:49:26,830 --> 01:49:30,510
Don't even let Alan get any HP back.

2850
01:49:33,290 --> 01:49:34,550
It could get worse?

2851
01:49:34,650 --> 01:49:35,450
The graphics?

2852
01:49:35,710 --> 01:49:35,910
How?

2853
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:37,650
There's no way.

2854
01:49:37,730 --> 01:49:43,790
I feel like Riot has not actually failed in terms of like making video games.

2855
01:49:43,790 --> 01:49:44,950
Like every...

2856
01:49:44,950 --> 01:49:48,590
Even so, they'll just throw enough money at it to make it successful.

2857
01:49:48,970 --> 01:49:50,090
That's all they have to do.

2858
01:49:52,070 --> 01:49:55,070
They just need to throw enough money at it until it's successful.

2859
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:01,460
I feel like the graphics will get better.

2860
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,440
You know what I'm really looking forward to?

2861
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:06,300
To see how they're gonna add cosmetics into it.

2862
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:17,400
I'm looking forward to see how they add like add cosmetics into this fucking game.

2863
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:23,360
That's like what they're good at.

2864
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:28,840
They're so good at adding at doing like what's it called?

2865
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:31,380
At like skins and stuff.

2866
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:45,420
Just re... Oh, it's true!

2867
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:48,300
They don't even need to come up with new skins!

2868
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:49,960
They just bring...

2869
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:50,080
Yeah!

2870
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:52,760
Okay, Riot is very good at microtransaction.

2871
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:55,960
But like, they don't even need to come up with new concepts!

2872
01:50:56,200 --> 01:51:03,420
All they have to do is literally just... literally just like bring the cosmetics from League into this.

2873
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:06,520
Oh shit!

2874
01:51:06,740 --> 01:51:07,720
Alan, that's embarrassing.

2875
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:17,760
Oh no.

2876
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:19,100
No, the Yasu main!

2877
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:21,880
That shit you should have told me!

2878
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:23,040
You were Yasu main!

2879
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:27,240
Holy shit!

2880
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:27,560
Holy shit!

2881
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:29,500
He jumped over her super!

2882
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:33,360
We could have killed this entire lobby!

2883
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:39,420
Oh my god!

2884
01:51:43,220 --> 01:51:52,540
Guys, I think it's... I think it's like Lecce's fault for not telling me that, you know, he could have said that, you know, that's his main.

2885
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,020
He's literally one V2-ing as Yasu.

2886
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:57,460
Oh my god!

2887
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:03,680
It's okay!

2888
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:04,760
It's okay!

2889
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:07,060
He's gonna clutch it right...

2890
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:07,160
Oh!

2891
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:12,790
Holy shit!

2892
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:14,590
You got this!

2893
01:52:14,990 --> 01:52:15,590
Please!

2894
01:52:15,870 --> 01:52:18,430
Bro, the Yasu doesn't even take any damage!

2895
01:52:19,350 --> 01:52:20,710
Oh my god, bro!

2896
01:52:20,790 --> 01:52:21,450
This guy's insane!

2897
01:52:22,150 --> 01:52:23,970
This guy's actually insane!

2898
01:52:23,970 --> 01:52:26,170
Wait, that was my teammate!

2899
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:29,330
That was actually my teammate!

2900
01:52:30,270 --> 01:52:32,010
Or it's his fault for being...

2901
01:52:32,010 --> 01:52:32,690
You're right!

2902
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:37,830
You know, if you were a fighting game player, you should know all the characters!

2903
01:52:39,790 --> 01:52:40,430
Wait!

2904
01:52:40,730 --> 01:52:42,150
Alan got carried!

2905
01:52:42,490 --> 01:52:45,090
Alan got carried by my old teammate!

2906
01:52:45,330 --> 01:52:46,490
Oh my god!

2907
01:52:46,990 --> 01:52:47,990
That's embarrassing!

2908
01:52:50,870 --> 01:52:51,510
Chaos!

2909
01:52:51,510 --> 01:52:54,370
I can't believe Chaos beat me!

2910
01:52:57,870 --> 01:52:58,670
Alan...

2911
01:52:58,670 --> 01:53:00,830
Alan actually got carried!

2912
01:53:03,370 --> 01:53:04,890
Holy shit!

2913
01:53:05,310 --> 01:53:05,830
Oh!

2914
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:07,450
Leche was...

2915
01:53:07,450 --> 01:53:09,090
Leche was actually the gamer.

2916
01:53:09,370 --> 01:53:12,770
He was the secret gamer in the end.

2917
01:53:15,530 --> 01:53:16,890
That was fun!

2918
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:20,270
I had a lot of fun trying out 2x KO.

2919
01:53:20,550 --> 01:53:23,610
Even though it was on keyboard and not my leverless controller.

2920
01:53:24,030 --> 01:53:26,090
I mean, I won so many games!

2921
01:53:27,590 --> 01:53:29,690
I won so many games too!

2922
01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:31,870
So like, I'm pretty happy with myself.

2923
01:53:32,050 --> 01:53:32,730
I beat some...

2924
01:53:32,730 --> 01:53:34,450
I beat some players...

2925
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:37,270
Some of my dragoons here who are FGC players.

2926
01:53:38,070 --> 01:53:39,250
Don't think I don't know!

2927
01:53:39,570 --> 01:53:40,710
You guys must have...

2928
01:53:40,710 --> 01:53:42,510
You guys had this code longer than me!

2929
01:53:42,730 --> 01:53:45,430
I literally got the code an hour before stream, guys!

2930
01:53:48,150 --> 01:53:50,270
And I beat some of them!

2931
01:53:50,550 --> 01:53:50,890
Yeah!

2932
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:53,750
No, I might be a prodigy!

2933
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:55,550
Guys, I think I'm just...

2934
01:53:55,550 --> 01:53:56,530
I think I'm gifted.

2935
01:54:00,730 --> 01:54:01,850
Okay, Toki...

2936
01:54:06,190 --> 01:54:07,310
Toki, please...

2937
01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:11,030
I'm...

2938
01:54:11,030 --> 01:54:11,430
I'm her!

2939
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:17,550
Okay, Toki, sure...

2940
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:22,370
That was fun!

2941
01:54:22,710 --> 01:54:22,910
I...

2942
01:54:22,910 --> 01:54:24,390
I really had a lot of fun.

2943
01:54:24,470 --> 01:54:25,770
I hope you guys had a lot of fun.

2944
01:54:26,190 --> 01:54:26,770
Um...

2945
01:54:26,770 --> 01:54:28,350
You are not her!

2946
01:54:29,590 --> 01:54:31,990
If anything, Lecce is her!

2947
01:54:32,650 --> 01:54:33,230
Hey!

2948
01:54:33,390 --> 01:54:34,850
But I was there, guys!

2949
01:54:35,110 --> 01:54:36,970
I was there with Lecce!

2950
01:54:37,270 --> 01:54:39,610
So that... that means something!

2951
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:43,050
Bro thinks she's her!

2952
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:47,690
Hey, guys!

2953
01:54:47,810 --> 01:54:49,130
I'm gonna call it here, everybody.

2954
01:54:49,570 --> 01:54:51,270
Um, it's so funny.

2955
01:54:51,410 --> 01:54:53,910
Uh, for next week's schedule, it's very funny.

2956
01:54:54,010 --> 01:54:57,310
The amount of people that added me regarding the Crow game...

2957
01:54:57,310 --> 01:55:06,270
I had... I had so many people add me and even, like, my... my staff and also, like, my friends were like, you should play this game!

2958
01:55:06,530 --> 01:55:07,310
Oh my god!

2959
01:55:07,330 --> 01:55:08,330
It's Crowki's game!

2960
01:55:08,670 --> 01:55:14,390
Anyway, next week, Crowki's gonna have their own stream next week, um, playing that Crow game.

2961
01:55:15,430 --> 01:55:26,710
That's the only... and also the... I'll be streaming the Wukong launch, uh, on launch, so I think the Wukong game is releasing at 7pm PST on Monday, so I will be streaming that too.

2962
01:55:26,910 --> 01:55:27,550
Anyway, guys!

2963
01:55:27,630 --> 01:55:28,770
I'm gonna call it here, everybody.

2964
01:55:29,210 --> 01:55:38,230
Um, I always have so much work to do behind the scenes, so I'm gonna be working... I'm gonna do some behind-the-scenes work after this stream, so I'm gonna call it here now.

2965
01:55:38,490 --> 01:55:46,850
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing, and if you stay up for me, head to the bed, cause you deserve it!

2966
01:55:46,990 --> 01:55:48,130
I'll see you guys next time, everybody!

2967
01:55:48,710 --> 01:55:49,590
Bye, guys!

2968
01:55:50,510 --> 01:55:50,990
Bye!
