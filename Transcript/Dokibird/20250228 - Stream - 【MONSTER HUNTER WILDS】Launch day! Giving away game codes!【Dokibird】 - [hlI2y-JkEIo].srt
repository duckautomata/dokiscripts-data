1
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,090
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,550
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,490
Oh my god.

4
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,790
Okay, I fucked up a little bit because...

5
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,210
So, for those who don't know, I do have the early access...

6
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,770
I actually... Okay, so I fucked up several things.

7
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,030
So, I didn't realize that I actually have the early access copy.

8
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,490
So, I could've been...

9
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,090
I could play this game since this morning.

10
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,170
Because I was like, alright, gotta put my game releases on launch.

11
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,550
So, that's why I put it at 9 because I was like...

12
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,830
I didn't realize I had the early access game.

13
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,910
But I already made my schedule too.

14
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,330
I already made my schedule, so I was just like, okay, well...

15
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,550
I'm not gonna push this stream earlier.

16
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,310
Because, you know...

17
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,090
No, the thing is...

18
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,230
So, a huge shoutout to MSI for sponsoring today's stream.

19
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,470
I'm compiling shaders right now, for those who are wondering why we're not in the game yet.

20
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:01,970
I didn't realize... I keep forgetting that every new game now requires you to compile shaders.

21
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,990
So, that's what I'm waiting on at the moment.

22
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,470
But anyway, a huge shoutout to MSI for sponsoring today's stream.

23
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,290
MSI has a special collaboration regarding Monster Hunter Wild's launch date.

24
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,450
Where you purchase a monitor from MSI.

25
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,370
And I'm using one of their monitors right now.

26
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,710
You'll be able to get a copy of Monster Hunter Wild's plus $30 of Steam code.

27
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,450
So, basically, it's a little promotion that they're doing.

28
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,930
So, a huge shoutout to MSI.

29
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:36,130
They also provided me five game codes to give away to my Dragoons at the end of the stream.

30
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:42,810
So, if you don't have Monster Hunter Wild's yet, this might be a chance to be able to get a copy of Monster Hunter Wild's at the end of the stream.

31
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,090
So, there's gonna be a giveaway for that.

32
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,350
Anyway, so, MSI provided me a free game code for Monster Hunter Wild's.

33
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,870
But it was supposed to be for launch date.

34
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,010
But thing is, I also received a...

35
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:08,630
So, Capcom USA also reached out to me to provide me, you know, with the whole, like, the special limited edition creator merch package.

36
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,870
So, I got that.

37
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:17,370
And in there, you receive an early copy of the game as well.

38
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:23,210
So, I received an email from them and saying, you can stream this game starting at this time.

39
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,890
And I was like, oh, I already have the code.

40
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,090
But then they were like, we are providing you the early copy version.

41
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,830
So, then I was like, oh my god, wait.

42
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,850
So, I got two game codes.

43
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:43,710
But, obviously, I got the early access copy code too.

44
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,130
So, I was just like, oh my god, wait, okay.

45
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:58,690
So, obviously, you know, I used that just to make sure I could download the game and unpack everything.

46
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,390
But then I forgot.

47
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,530
I was like, I am so ready.

48
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,590
I'm so ready to get into the game instantly.

49
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,710
But then I forgot that the compile shaders.

50
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,990
So, that's what we're waiting on right now.

51
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,190
I'm stuck in the compiling shaders tab at the moment.

52
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,170
So, yeah, I fucked up.

53
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,550
So, my history of Monster Hunter.

54
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,350
I need you guys to know, there's gonna be a lot of backseating and a lot of people yelling at me.

55
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:33,570
Because the last time, I played Monster Hunter once in my life.

56
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:40,470
And not once, I only played one Monster Hunter game in my life.

57
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:46,570
And it is the PSP version in 2007.

58
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,690
And it was in Japanese.

59
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,130
Because it wasn't my game.

60
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,150
It was my dad's Monster Hunter game on the PSP.

61
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:00,570
So, I had no idea what to really do in that game.

62
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,810
When I did quests, because everything was in Japanese.

63
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,250
So, I just didn't know how the fuck to play the game.

64
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,530
But I still played the game.

65
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,390
I just did it by trial and error.

66
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,950
No, my dad did not understand Japanese.

67
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,810
But he can read the characters.

68
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:26,690
Some Chinese characters are similar to Japanese characters because of kanji.

69
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,210
So, he was able to read some of the text.

70
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,050
So, he could understand what to do.

71
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,670
So, I basically brute-forced my way to learning.

72
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,710
Sharpening the knives and everything.

73
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:43,930
But obviously, the only weapon I used was the twin knives.

74
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,830
Because it was the easiest to understand with my little brain.

75
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,770
It was the easiest to understand when I couldn't read the language.

76
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,830
Or understand what the fuck I was doing.

77
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,750
Because all I had to do was sharpen my blades.

78
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,390
And I knew how to do that.

79
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,770
I knew what the item was that sharpened the blade.

80
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,030
And then I knew how to feed myself.

81
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,770
And that's it.

82
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:13,990
So, when I had missions where you had to kill this monster.

83
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,470
Or specific monsters.

84
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,110
I didn't know what the fuck to do.

85
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,090
I didn't know because I can't read.

86
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,570
So, all the quests I did was...

87
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,470
I wasn't hunting at all.

88
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,750
All the quests I did in Monster Hunter when I didn't know what the fuck was going on.

89
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,370
Was gathering.

90
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,850
Because you know what I did for gathering quests?

91
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,670
I literally just picked up every item I could see.

92
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,010
Until the quest log was like, you've gathered one of the five.

93
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,830
And I was like, oh, it's this item.

94
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,890
I'm like, oh, okay, I got the item.

95
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,130
Or the quests where I had to kill the weaker monsters.

96
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:02,510
The ones that spawn the main dragons or whatever.

97
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:07,530
So, you're like, oh, you have to kill one out of five of the deers and stuff like that.

98
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,210
So, I just kill all the little guys.

99
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:13,510
Because if I see multiples, then I'd be like, okay, this is not a big boss.

100
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,450
So, I know they're not the big bosses because I have to kill five of them.

101
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,370
So, then I was like, okay, I gotta kill everything until it says one out of five.

102
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,270
So, I did that.

103
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,530
I just went and killed everything until one out of five.

104
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,510
I was like, I did it!

105
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,090
Yay!

106
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,230
I found it!

107
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,790
I found the monster!

108
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,590
So, that was how I played Monster Hunter in 2000.

109
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,150
I don't even remember if it was 2007.

110
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,810
I just know it was a 2007 game because I was looking through the covers.

111
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,690
I was like, which one was the game that I...

112
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,770
So, I...

113
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,590
Thank you for the Akasupa!

114
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,690
Thank you, thank you!

115
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,670
Can I get free coffee at the Monster Hunter Wild, please?

116
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,710
Thank you for the Akasupa!

117
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,010
Thank you, thank you, Liete!

118
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,890
But yeah, like I said, that was the last...

119
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,190
That was the only Monster Hunter game I've ever played.

120
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,910
But I also have various...

121
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,250
But I love the cats.

122
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,290
I always... I have so much merch.

123
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,650
Not a lot of them, but I have random Monster Hunter merch.

124
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,990
Because I just love...

125
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,830
I just love the cats and the chibi monster designs.

126
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:16,810
Like the Palicos.

127
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,530
And then, you know, the chibi plushies they've done of the monsters?

128
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,890
I have some of those because I thought they were just really cute.

129
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,650
So, like, I have several of those.

130
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,870
That, like, just in my room.

131
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,570
Donut, thank you for the...

132
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,550
Welcome to Tomato Farm!

133
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,270
Welcome, welcome!

134
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,630
But yeah, today is the launch day of Monster Hunter Wild.

135
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,790
So, like I said, this is like my only experience with Monster Hunter.

136
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,230
So, I don't really know what weapons are good.

137
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,170
I don't really know, like, what the current generation of Monster Hunter is now.

138
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,870
Since, like, you know, my only experience was 2000.

139
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,630
The 2007 PSP game.

140
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,590
Should I play on a controller or do I play on mouse and keyboard?

141
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,050
I don't know.

142
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,550
Is it easier on mouse and keyboard?

143
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,030
Like, if I...

144
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,230
Apparently, there's guns?

145
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,110
Like, I don't know.

146
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,330
I've never... I've never, like...

147
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,230
I don't know.

148
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:11,030
So, I'm gonna need you guys to let me know how to play this game.

149
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,690
Cause, like, some of you guys were like, there's a gun in this game.

150
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,990
But, like, if there's guns, shouldn't I use mouse and keyboard then?

151
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:22,490
Like, wouldn't that make sense to use a mouse and keyboard if there's a gun?

152
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,610
Yeah, so, like, controller for melee.

153
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,170
Alright, do we...

154
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,030
Okay, I'm gonna...

155
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,510
I don't know.

156
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,170
Actually, we'll try mouse and keyboard for now.

157
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,890
And then we'll see how I feel.

158
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,310
We'll see how I feel.

159
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,870
Because I feel like if I'm gonna do melee, then I'll do controller.

160
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,850
But if I do end up liking the guns or, like, the bows or whatever the fuck they are...

161
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,590
Then I might use...

162
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,750
I might try and do...

163
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,410
Try and do M and K.

164
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,450
So, we'll see how it goes.

165
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,550
Cause if it's melee, then it would make sense that I use, like, controller.

166
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,870
Cause what am I aiming at?

167
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,950
I'm just fucking beating people up.

168
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,350
What am I aiming at?

169
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,390
Alright.

170
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,190
We finished unpacking.

171
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,490
Woah.

172
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,150
Also, sound, guys.

173
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,470
Make sure everything is okay.

174
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,130
But, yeah.

175
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,950
I heard the Palicos are, like, extremely cute, as always.

176
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,870
Which makes me happy.

177
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,930
English, please.

178
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:20,810
English.

179
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,270
Cause I'm not here to read.

180
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,550
Country.

181
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,650
Canada.

182
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,470
We're asking for our internal regarding legal compliance.

183
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,690
Don't worry, guys.

184
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,610
I was born in 1900.

185
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,490
How would they know?

186
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,770
Is your date of birth correct?

187
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,230
Yes.

188
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,270
Yeah, I've agreed to accept.

189
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,570
Because Monster started out with just controlling points.

190
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,030
I've heard M and K is alright for both.

191
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:58,570
Yeah, that's the thing.

192
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,410
Like, if I...

193
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,170
Oh, look at that.

194
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,950
Look at all that free DLC.

195
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,430
Yes.

196
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,270
Yes.

197
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,810
I love free stuff.

198
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,870
Yes.

199
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,270
I don't know what any of these things are.

200
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,490
My Oshi is a mega hag.

201
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,230
Awesome.

202
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:16,470
Next scene.

203
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,950
Thank you for the super chat.

204
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:18,330
Thank you.

205
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:18,830
Thank you.

206
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,170
I have no idea what any of these things are.

207
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,050
But I love free stuff.

208
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,930
Yes.

209
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:29,630
Nice.

210
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,690
Okay, I agree.

211
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,970
I agree to accept.

212
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,790
I'm using keyboard layout.

213
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,830
Okay.

214
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,330
Do not...

215
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:43,810
Okay, sure.

216
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,610
I don't know.

217
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,330
Thank you for playing my favorite game series.

218
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,790
Oh, thank you for the first super chat.

219
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,590
Thank you.

220
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,230
I really appreciate it.

221
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:51,870
Thank you.

222
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,010
Not so Deadpool.

223
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,750
Doki is not aiming kind of gun.

224
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,610
Wait, what do you mean?

225
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,170
What do you mean?

226
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,890
It's a name.

227
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,830
It's a gun.

228
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,350
It's always a display.

229
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,530
There's no difference between light and dark areas.

230
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,530
Okay, I'll just do two.

231
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,870
Maybe one.

232
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:10,590
What?

233
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,330
I don't know.

234
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,410
I can't...

235
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,670
While facing it, there's no...

236
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,630
Oh, so you're not supposed to see anything.

237
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:16,970
All right.

238
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,130
Facing it, there's no difference between white...

239
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,290
Okay, so it's supposed to be...

240
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:22,550
Okay.

241
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,730
Adjust the brightness of the screen until the symbol on the left is barely visible.

242
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,690
I mean, that's fine.

243
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,010
Audio mixing...

244
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,010
Oh, there's like voice chat, too.

245
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,130
I don't...

246
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,690
I don't trust...

247
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,650
I don't trust...

248
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,070
If we play with dragoons today, I'm sorry.

249
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,430
I don't trust you guys.

250
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,410
If we play with dragoons today, I'm sorry.

251
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,650
You can always...

252
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,230
Fuck solo.

253
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,870
Why the fuck would I solo?

254
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:05,970
Lame.

255
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,070
Unity, thank you for the five gifted ships.

256
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:12,730
Thank you.

257
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,670
Thank you.

258
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,630
Again, thank you for the super chat.

259
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:15,870
Thank you.

260
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,310
Thank you.

261
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,990
Monster Hunter is one of my favorite games.

262
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,770
I hope you enjoy the game as much as us.

263
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,730
It'd be nice to see collab with other streamers playing the game, too.

264
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,110
Can't wait to see what weapon you use.

265
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:24,870
You know, like...

266
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,670
You know that all the Sloppy Sisters received a creator package?

267
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,450
I was thinking of like asking if they all want to try to do a...

268
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,330
Do a collab with Monster Hunter in the future.

269
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,590
She hate...

270
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,350
Alright, dragoons.

271
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,210
Do you guys...

272
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,670
Do you trust other dragoons?

273
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:38,630
Do you...

274
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,010
Do you trust the other dragoons?

275
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,990
No.

276
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,930
Alright, let's see.

277
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,250
I wonder what...

278
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:56,570
Oh, wait.

279
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,470
They have an arachnophobia assistant?

280
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,050
I wonder what it looks like, though.

281
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,070
Yes, with my life.

282
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,070
Camera shake.

283
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,690
I don't really have motion sickness, but like...

284
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,330
I might...

285
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,890
I'd definitely lower the camera shake, though.

286
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:16,450
For sure.

287
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:18,590
Whoa.

288
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,410
Monster Hunter Wilds.

289
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,370
Okay.

290
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:25,610
Okay.

291
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,310
Menu text size.

292
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:28,870
Oh, okay.

293
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,430
Wait, can I not...

294
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,090
Subtitle.

295
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,210
Okay, large, because we're blind as fuck.

296
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,790
Speaker names.

297
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,070
Yes, please.

298
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,930
I'll forget their names if they don't tell me who they are.

299
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,210
I would 100.

300
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,490
No other dragoons, including Manny Airport Ninja.

301
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,170
Thank you for the super chat.

302
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:48,670
Thank you.

303
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,330
Thank you.

304
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,370
I knew it.

305
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,410
I knew you guys don't trust the others.

306
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,010
I fucking knew it.

307
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,530
You guys can't lie to me.

308
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,370
Capped.

309
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,350
But how much?

310
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,810
How much is it capped?

311
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:03,490
60!

312
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,970
No wonder my frame...

313
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,930
No wonder I look great.

314
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,330
Okay, let's do like 144.

315
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,130
I don't have 144.

316
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,610
I have...

317
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,930
I have 200, but like...

318
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,830
I feel a little wild, you know?

319
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,170
I feel...

320
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,550
I feel less wild.

321
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,070
I feel...

322
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,150
Wait, okay.

323
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,730
I feel less wild now.

324
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,640
That's crazy.

325
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,480
Oh my god, the moment it went to 144, I was like...

326
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,510
That was a little too wild, guys.

327
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,730
That was a little too wild.

328
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,270
It's okay.

329
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,330
Now...

330
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,770
Okay, let's do high.

331
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,110
I don't think we need ultra, right?

332
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,010
Hi Doki, it's my birthday!

333
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,290
I remember seeing you last year playing Batman.

334
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,270
Love your streams and have so for years.

335
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,250
You're my Kamiyoshi.

336
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,230
I look forward to another happy year.

337
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,530
Thank you for making my days brighter and inspiring me to do better.

338
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,850
Thank you for the magenta super, Broku!

339
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,410
Happy birthday to you.

340
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,730
Happy birthday to you.

341
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,410
Happy birthday, dear Broku.

342
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,010
Happy birthday to you.

343
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,570
Yeah, happy birthday!

344
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:31,950
Happy birthday!

345
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,690
Okay, let's get the motion blur off.

346
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,810
Alright, guys, I figured I had to be less wild.

347
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:43,410
I know it says Monster Hunter is wild, but we gotta be a little less wild, guys.

348
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,270
Just a little bit less wild.

349
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,570
Alright, voice volume...

350
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,390
95, because I don't trust it.

351
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,230
Play audio?

352
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,370
Wait, feline language?

353
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,230
What can I set?

354
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,110
Voice typeset?

355
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,110
Oh, okay, to the voice typeset.

356
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,410
Okay, then that should be fine.

357
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,610
Everything should be fine.

358
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:08,490
Alright.

359
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,210
That's everything, right?

360
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,770
Alright, we can start game.

361
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,830
Wait, does it talk in English?

362
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,450
Wait, they can either speak English or meow?

363
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,570
Oh my god, I would want them to meow.

364
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,390
Wait, the cats?

365
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,590
That's...

366
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,050
That's a crime.

367
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,410
The cats can talk now?

368
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:34,690
If I wanted a cat that could talk to me...

369
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,410
I would have just...

370
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,310
Who taught... I know, who the fuck taught them English?

371
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,170
I was just like, what would I do if I wanted a cat that could talk?

372
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,090
I'd just get Garfield.

373
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,470
Oh wait, there's no audio?

374
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,170
What?

375
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,170
Is there audio now?

376
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,370
There's audio on my end.

377
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,710
Is it actually muted?

378
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,130
It says there's audio.

379
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,230
Oh, it's just low, okay.

380
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,890
I'll push it up.

381
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,070
Okay, let me know if it's better.

382
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,250
I pushed it up a little.

383
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,730
Oh shit, what time is it?

384
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,570
Oh, fuck!

385
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,430
Okay guys, I'm gonna mute myself real quick.

386
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,350
I might have to pick up my medic...

387
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,090
Uber eats some medicine.

388
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,550
I

389
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,380
forgot.

390
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,980
I forgot my medicine.

391
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,640
I forgot my medicine is here.

392
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,880
Uber eats some NyQuil.

393
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,340
No, I wanna watch the cutscene too!

394
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,540
What?!

395
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,280
I wanna watch it!

396
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,980
Don't worry, they can wait like 2 minutes.

397
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,140
Is this a long cutscene?

398
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,940
No, Taixin!

399
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,320
Wait, can I pause it?

400
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,860
Wait, I can pause it?

401
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,420
Wait, I don't have N-key.

402
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,060
I don't have N-key!

403
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,380
God, I need to get my other keyboard.

404
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:32,520
Wait.

405
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,720
Oh my god.

406
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,680
Where is it?

407
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:38,820
Okay.

408
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,000
Okay, I'll be right back, guys.

409
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,300
I'll be right back!

410
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,600
Okay, I'm back!

411
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,560
Sorry, guys!

412
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,220
I actually forgot I Uber-eated some...

413
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,560
I forgot!

414
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,020
I was like, what's caught me?

415
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,160
It's like 9.30pm.

416
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,440
What the fuck is caught me?

417
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,220
And I was like, oh my god, my Uber-eats order.

418
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,640
Sorry, people have been like, why has she been like, why is she moving?

419
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,840
It's been so long!

420
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,800
Sorry, I had to get my cough drops and...

421
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,080
Oh, I forgot to un-end this.

422
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,400
Oh, wait.

423
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,560
I was running out of cough drops and then my friend was recommending...

424
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,340
My friend was like, you should really get some NyQuil and DayQuil.

425
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,360
It'll really help you.

426
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,720
And I was like, okay.

427
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,740
Alright.

428
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,280
Let's go.

429
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,880
I can't believe they can talk.

430
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,020
Who the fuck gave them permission?

431
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,600
Like, if I wanted someone that can talk, I'd just recruit a regular human.

432
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,760
Like, why would I get cats anyway?

433
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,540
Like, what's the point of having a...

434
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,120
What's the point of having a cat servant?

435
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
It'd be like...

436
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,320
Like, I don't understand.

437
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,540
I'll just get a regular person.

438
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,780
Like...

439
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,900
The reason why I got cats is they can meow.

440
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,620
They can meow cutely.

441
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,580
Who gave them rights to talk?

442
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,170
Like...

443
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:41,750
They can meow.

444
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,050
I didn't give you permission to talk.

445
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:52,710
I want to understand.

446
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,650
No, you don't.

447
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,290
If you could understand your dog, you would be the most annoying piece of shit ever.

448
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,630
What if every time he's barking, he's like, fuck you!

449
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,470
Fuck you!

450
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:04,810
Yeah!

451
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,630
Fuck you!

452
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,740
That's your dog?

453
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,180
The Forbidden Lands?

454
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,040
Oh, more overall volume?

455
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,360
Okay, I got you.

456
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,140
Brought it up even more.

457
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,960
Apparently, they're supposed to not be able to talk.

458
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,080
They're supposed to like, not be able to talk in English.

459
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:54,260
This is like the first time in a Monster Hunter game that they can actually talk in English.

460
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,720
Or like, have a language that you can understand.

461
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,400
If your dog can talk to you, you won't think they're cute.

462
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,280
That's all I'm saying.

463
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,720
That's all I'm saying.

464
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,160
Alright, honey.

465
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,060
Oh, I can like, adjust it?

466
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,360
I don't wanna be a man or a woman.

467
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,720
That's like, that's always the hardest part.

468
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,200
Like, do I wanna be a man or a woman?

469
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,340
I don't know.

470
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,280
Alright.

471
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,660
What's sexy?

472
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,260
I should create my You're right.

473
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,200
You're right.

474
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,120
I was gonna say, what armor looks better?

475
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:50,540
Cause like, sometimes like, the armor looks different on like, the guy and the girl.

476
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,360
So like, which armor looks better?

477
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,080
Alright, we'll make me.

478
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,560
I'll make me.

479
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,100
We'll use a preface first.

480
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,380
Damn.

481
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,540
Since I was born in the 1900's...

482
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,680
Wait!

483
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:14,500
Since I doxxed my age and I was born in the 1900's?

484
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,200
Okay, let's look at the hairstyle.

485
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,320
Alright, do they have my hair?

486
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,500
Let's see.

487
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,620
Oh, it's not?

488
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,080
Okay, it's not locked this time.

489
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,160
Yeah, cause it used to be.

490
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,440
I remember it in the 2007 version.

491
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,740
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

492
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,300
Thank you, thank you.

493
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,020
Have you seen the clips of Bunny and the Talking Dog?

494
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,220
Talks by pressing a word button.

495
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,200
Yeah, and it's wrong.

496
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,240
No, I'm joking.

497
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,020
Thank you for the super chat.

498
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,440
Thank you.

499
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,660
Oh, they don't have my hairstyle.

500
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,340
I mean, they have...

501
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,640
God, this looks so wrong.

502
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,340
But like, fuck it.

503
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,280
They have Retro Turkey.

504
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,040
Fuck it.

505
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:06,880
Okay.

506
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,120
Guys, I can't.

507
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,560
I'm sorry.

508
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,760
I doxxed...

509
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,440
I doxxed

510
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,120
my...

511
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,280
Oh, sorry.

512
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,400
This looks like... Does this look like I was born in 1900, guys?

513
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,180
I think it does.

514
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:26,980
Wrinkles?

515
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,160
Hell yeah.

516
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,080
Yeah, I need to know.

517
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,400
I need you guys to know.

518
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,140
Alright, there we go.

519
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,460
I mean, I might as well.

520
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,980
I doxxed myself.

521
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,260
It needs to look 125.

522
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,680
Fun!

523
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,480
Thank you for the super chat.

524
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,320
Thank you, thank you.

525
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,280
Sorry for the bad timing on the previous super chat.

526
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,440
Anyways, happy hunting.

527
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,340
Gonna lurk and we're excited to see what weapon you choose.

528
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,580
Alright, I'm trying to get close to the light.

529
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:06,360
Okay, like, you know, the older you get the less eyebrows you're gonna...

530
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,200
I don't know.

531
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,660
Eyebrow shape.

532
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,900
Let's see.

533
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,840
What shape do I have?

534
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,420
This one.

535
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,360
Okay, and then...

536
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,020
Eyelash color.

537
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,820
I mean, it should be yellow, right?

538
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,120
Yeah.

539
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,400
Like, oh my gosh.

540
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,120
It looks fucking...

541
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:26,600
Okay.

542
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,620
There we go.

543
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,000
There we go.

544
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,180
So...

545
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,540
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

546
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,020
Thank you, thank you.

547
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,580
Alright, is this green?

548
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,520
Oh my god, it's so muted.

549
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,240
It's like I'm old.

550
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,620
It's muted with age or some shit.

551
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,080
Whoa.

552
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,140
Let's put it at 6.

553
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,080
Oh, I can edit the right eye?

554
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,060
Let's fucking aimbot time.

555
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,480
Wait, that's the wrong one.

556
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,040
Um...

557
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,740
Ah, fuck it.

558
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,360
No, I actually like the green.

559
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,220
No aimbot.

560
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,140
Wait, if I'm gonna use the gun, then maybe...

561
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,040
Maybe if I'm gonna use the gun, but like...

562
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,240
It's on the wrong side, but I can't be bothered to fix it.

563
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,880
Okay, I'll...

564
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,700
I'll fix it.

565
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,980
Okay, there we go.

566
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,660
There we go.

567
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,500
That should be fine.

568
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,340
Um, eye shape.

569
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,600
Oh, I can change the eye shape too?

570
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,120
Okay.

571
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,500
There we go.

572
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,280
You can literally... Okay, there we go.

573
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,280
That's fine.

574
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,120
I don't really care about the eye shape.

575
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,840
I mean, I don't really care about the nose either.

576
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,760
I mean, like, that...

577
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,080
That's basically it.

578
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,580
Like...

579
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,600
Wait, I realized the hairstyle does not match if I use...

580
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,960
Uh, if I do this.

581
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,620
Oh, but there's like no other hairstyle.

582
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,460
That's like my current hairstyle though.

583
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,420
Yeah, none of them is like my current one.

584
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,580
I guess like...

585
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,460
Like that.

586
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:03,920
No?

587
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,240
Yeah, none of them have my current hairstyle.

588
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,840
Cause, why do I look old?

589
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,560
Because I was born in 1900s.

590
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,760
Okay, I doxed my age today.

591
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,580
Um, on the confirm your age.

592
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,440
26?

593
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,780
Is it actually?

594
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,140
No, I don't know.

595
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,560
Spikely one looks...

596
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,100
Like, oh wait, there's this too?

597
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,240
Uh...

598
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,020
I could be like...

599
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,420
Independent women hairstyle.

600
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,420
The classic, like...

601
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,280
The strong independent women.

602
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,940
I don't know why they always...

603
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,760
There's always this hairstyle for that.

604
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,840
And there's like...

605
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,760
Horizon Dawn.

606
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,400
Uh...

607
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,840
I don't know.

608
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,500
Fuck it, we'll just go with...

609
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,820
Fuck it, we'll just...

610
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,440
Oh wait, and then there's Kingdom Hearts or Final Fantasy.

611
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,480
Um...

612
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,580
We'll just go with...

613
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,160
Fuck it, we'll just go with the ponytail.

614
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,720
Or not ponytail, the pigtails.

615
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,940
Uh, three is close?

616
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,660
Is it actually?

617
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:04,800
Three?

618
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,920
Is it though?

619
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,440
Three...

620
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,080
It's already at the ten though.

621
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,020
It's already at ten.

622
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,800
Nah, I'm gonna go back to the pigtails.

623
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,600
Nah, I think the pigtails look the best.

624
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,480
Alright.

625
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,180
Mouth.

626
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,060
Mouth position.

627
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,000
Can I be happier?

628
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,780
Oh, I can be.

629
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,740
I mean, that makes me look older.

630
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,420
Which is what I'm aiming for.

631
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:37,760
Yay!

632
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,500
Why is my teeth grey?

633
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,540
Oh my god.

634
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,420
Okay, I brush my teeth.

635
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,180
What the heck?

636
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,900
What the fuck?

637
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,440
Teeth stain?

638
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,320
Yeah, no teeth stain, please.

639
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,440
There we go.

640
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,600
I brush my teeth.

641
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,500
Alright, facial hair.

642
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,560
Wait, there's beard type?

643
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,640
Oh my god, no.

644
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,740
Face shape.

645
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,860
I think it's fine.

646
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,640
Physique.

647
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,400
Okay, muscle mass.

648
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,340
Um...

649
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,940
Nick, thank you for the Akasupa!

650
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,360
Thank you, thank you!

651
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,040
Um...

652
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,500
Faith, thank you for the superchat!

653
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,200
Thank you, thank you!

654
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,840
I'm a muscle grandma.

655
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,860
That's right.

656
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,520
Get yourself a grandma that never stops lifting.

657
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,020
I'm a muscle granny.

658
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,880
That's fucking right.

659
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,760
What the fuck is size?

660
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,000
Oh, I thought...

661
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,340
You know...

662
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,540
Guys, I thought size...

663
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,400
Was...

664
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,980
Something we all know.

665
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,660
I thought...

666
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,780
You know, we all thought...

667
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,120
We all thought it was that, guys.

668
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,980
I'll make it so I have like...

669
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,560
Eye bags.

670
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,040
Okay, is that eye bags?

671
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:06,600
Okay.

672
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,800
Is it?

673
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,820
I wanna make sure people know that I'm not okay.

674
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,180
I'm not okay.

675
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,720
Wait, is that it?

676
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,180
Is physique literally just muscle?

677
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,680
Alright, there we go.

678
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,580
Alright, bring up the volume a little bit more.

679
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,280
No problem.

680
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,420
If my dog started speaking English, he would have to start paying his share of the rent.

681
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,940
He ain't a pet no more.

682
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,920
That's exactly!

683
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,560
I'm not here for a roommate!

684
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,100
Thank you for the superchat, Gordon.

685
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,280
Thank you, thank you.

686
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,060
Alright.

687
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,920
That's me.

688
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,060
Alright.

689
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,580
Beard type.

690
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,180
Oh wait, how do I confirm?

691
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,920
Hair base color.

692
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,560
Yeah, everything looks good.

693
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,400
Wait, oh, can I change my clothes color?

694
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,560
Oh, I do that.

695
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,360
Hair accent.

696
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,420
Oh, I wanna change my clothes.

697
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,580
Oh my god, that's way too much customization.

698
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,720
Okay, what do I wear again?

699
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,680
I started to look at myself.

700
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,800
Like, I'm gonna take these clothes off anyway in the end, right?

701
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,320
Like, okay, that sounded really bad.

702
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,240
But like, you guys know what?

703
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:16,840
Fuck it.

704
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,980
I'll be swapping clothes later.

705
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,280
It's fine.

706
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,500
I don't need it.

707
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,780
Oh, whoa.

708
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:27,840
Nice.

709
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,880
I'll be swapping clothes anyway.

710
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,320
It'll be fine.

711
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,540
Oh, I can select my voice too?

712
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,920
Oh, nice.

713
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,030
Wait, how do I listen to this?

714
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,830
How do I listen to my voice?

715
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,990
It doesn't even tell me.

716
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:47,810
Uh...

717
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,230
Where the fuck is my voice?

718
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,230
It's a different menu?

719
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,750
Where is it?

720
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,450
Where the fuck is the menu for it?

721
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,010
Oh, I have to go back?

722
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:02,790
Okay, wait.

723
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,810
I'm a little worried.

724
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,450
What happens if I do save?

725
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,270
Okay, I saved my design.

726
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,250
Okay, I just gotta make sure.

727
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,130
Oh, there it is!

728
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,930
I see it!

729
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:17,210
Okay.

730
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,870
How the fuck did I get here?

731
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,570
Okay.

732
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,440
Okay.

733
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,350
Okay, let's do it.

734
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,390
Let's be normal.

735
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:43,650
Let's...

736
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,210
Yeah!

737
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,670
Alright, I'm cool with that.

738
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,170
Alright, let's be normal.

739
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,310
Wait, can I have different innerwear?

740
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,690
Oh, shit.

741
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,710
Let's be very normal.

742
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,170
Wait, actually...

743
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:01,570
Uh...

744
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,190
Ooh, yeah.

745
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,090
No, I definitely want this.

746
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,850
How else am I gonna show my grand bod?

747
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:15,890
How?

748
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,270
How else?

749
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,010
Tights?

750
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,430
No, we don't need to show that.

751
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,990
What's starting armor?

752
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:25,890
Hope?

753
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,550
None.

754
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,070
What if I just have no armor?

755
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,090
Ooh, chainmail.

756
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,630
Ooh, I like the leather one.

757
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,270
Wait, do I want... No, I want the leather armor.

758
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:38,770
Yeah!

759
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,550
Yeah, let's go, granny!

760
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,410
Let's go!

761
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:43,370
Just...

762
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,530
That's right!

763
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,450
Uh, Brady, thank you for the superchat!

764
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,550
Thank you, thank you!

765
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,250
Hi, Doki!

766
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,310
Yesterday was my birthday!

767
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,750
And I hope you're feeling better!

768
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:52,510
Thank you for the superchat!

769
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,390
Thank you, thank you!

770
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,650
I had a great birthday yesterday!

771
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,610
Happy birthday to you!

772
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,590
Happy birthday to you!

773
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,510
Happy birthday, dear Brady!

774
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,250
Happy birthday to you!

775
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:03,630
Yeah!

776
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:04,370
Happy birthday!

777
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,470
Alright, let's make Doki amber doge.

778
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,290
Oh my god, wait.

779
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,110
I can make a cuter cat.

780
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,170
Like an actual...

781
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:16,910
Wait.

782
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:17,570
Okay.

783
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:18,630
I'm sorry.

784
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,430
I'm so, so sorry.

785
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:22,470
But like, there's so much...

786
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:24,530
Okay.

787
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,830
Okay, we can make Doki amber doge.

788
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:27,550
We can do it.

789
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,190
Wait, I can make Garfield!

790
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,930
You're so right!

791
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,590
I'm sorry.

792
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,890
I'm gonna make Garfield.

793
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,570
I'm sorry.

794
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:39,850
I'm sorry.

795
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:43,050
Okay, this is Garfield's ears.

796
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,030
I'm gonna make Garfield.

797
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,550
That is...

798
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,210
To foot your line language.

799
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,370
You're not allowed to talk.

800
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:50,610
Wait.

801
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,610
Oh, you are definitely...

802
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,970
You're definitely not allowed to talk.

803
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,690
I'm not letting you have...

804
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,450
I'm not giving you the right to talk anymore.

805
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,870
You guys hear that?

806
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:10,610
That is...

807
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,990
That is wrong.

808
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,070
That is so wrong.

809
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,740
They sound the same.

810
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,020
This is the same type!

811
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,240
Alright, let's make Garfield.

812
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,820
Okay, Garfield is short-haired.

813
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,700
Ear size...

814
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,120
Okay, I think four was right.

815
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,280
Four was definitely right.

816
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,220
And then he has the...

817
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,580
Oh, he has...

818
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,560
He has these whiskers, right?

819
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,440
Yeah, these are the whiskers on top.

820
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,100
There we go.

821
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,920
And then...

822
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,980
Garfield doesn't actually talk!

823
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:49,620
He...

824
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,580
It's cause like...

825
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,480
Okay, the reason why you think Garfield can talk...

826
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,020
Is that he's talking to other animals.

827
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,100
But John doesn't know...

828
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,100
Doesn't hear what he says.

829
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,440
That's why it's thought bubbles.

830
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:03,620
Guys...

831
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,100
Know your Garfield lore!

832
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,620
Guys...

833
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,940
I can't believe you don't know your Garfield...

834
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,540
Are you really trying to um...

835
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,080
Actually be the number one Garfield fan right now?

836
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:17,960
Are you...

837
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,060
I can't believe you would say...

838
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,140
You were like...

839
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,060
Garfield...

840
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,120
No, you don't know shit!

841
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,680
Okay, this is Garfield's pattern.

842
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,300
I know that for sure.

843
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,980
Okay, um...

844
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,760
This is Garfield's... Oh, but I love the little...

845
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,120
Okay, but he has like...

846
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,540
Stripes though, that's the thing.

847
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,380
So like, it should be this.

848
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,080
Okay, the base color is orange.

849
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,520
So we need to get the right orange, guys.

850
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:50,540
Um...

851
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,640
Oh yeah, this is the right orange.

852
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,040
And then the pattern accent...

853
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,640
What is this?

854
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,480
Okay, this is also the same orange.

855
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,120
Oh, this looks so wrong.

856
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,000
I'm not gonna...

857
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,390
Oh my god.

858
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,850
Okay, let's just make it all orange so I can figure...

859
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,430
Okay, wait, I need to... Let me pull...

860
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,750
Let me pull it up.

861
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,310
I need to figure this out.

862
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:17,630
Okay.

863
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,270
Okay, this is like the best I can do.

864
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,510
Like this.

865
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,450
Okay, there we go.

866
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,610
I mean, it sort of looks like Garfield.

867
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,550
We have Garfield at home.

868
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,330
I am trying my best right now!

869
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,530
Okay.

870
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,830
And then...

871
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:35,850
His pattern.

872
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,510
I'll make it like...

873
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,410
I'll make it like dark orange.

874
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,270
So it looks less wrong.

875
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:42,170
There we go.

876
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,190
It sort of looks like Garfield, right?

877
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,050
I mean, sort of, yeah.

878
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,270
Okay, maybe like...

879
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,610
Maybe if I...

880
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,130
Make it more orange.

881
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:53,950
Yeah!

882
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:54,550
See?

883
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:55,750
That's Garfield!

884
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,670
Don't even try my best!

885
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,890
That's...

886
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,130
That's Garfield!

887
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,970
Look, I can't make him fatter!

888
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:12,850
Literally, that's like the only pattern where it works, guys!

889
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:18,090
That's literally the only pattern that works with Garfield.

890
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:19,090
Okay.

891
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:23,730
I'm trying!

892
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,530
It's so hard!

893
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:27,250
Okay.

894
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,730
Okay, maybe it's this.

895
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,380
But like, it's yellow!

896
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,100
It's like a yellowish... yeah, like this.

897
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,020
There we go.

898
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,700
Sort of like Garfield.

899
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,300
Like, great value Garfield.

900
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,320
Netflix version.

901
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,320
Burrito, thank you for the superchat.

902
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,020
I'm trying!

903
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,180
I'm trying so hard!

904
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,000
Okay, there we go.

905
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,020
There's my Garfield.

906
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,140
Alright.

907
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,220
Maybe it'll look better if he's longer hair.

908
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,540
No, he does not look better.

909
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,280
There we go.

910
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:04,840
Now!

911
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,060
I mean...

912
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,680
Come on!

913
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,880
That's Garfield right there.

914
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,540
That's Garfield right there.

915
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:13,720
Okay.

916
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,300
Alright, let's go through the tail types.

917
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,340
That's...

918
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,200
That's basically him.

919
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,220
There we go.

920
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:24,700
Now!

921
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,960
Now it looks like him, right?

922
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,080
Okay.

923
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,460
What is marking type?

924
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,640
Oh, shit.

925
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,060
Okay.

926
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,320
Okay, let's see.

927
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,320
Let me look at this.

928
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,080
Um...

929
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,960
I mean, if I like...

930
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,920
I guess we can make it just like...

931
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,900
like that, right?

932
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,120
And then we'll make it...

933
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,060
Okay, no.

934
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:52,760
That doesn't work.

935
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,860
That does not work.

936
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,220
Okay, we don't do any markings.

937
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,520
Okay, there we go.

938
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,860
I mean...

939
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,060
I can resize and move those.

940
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:02,920
Resize what?

941
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,280
Oh, I can move.

942
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,640
Oh, I can move this!

943
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:06,940
Okay.

944
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,280
Wait, I figured it out.

945
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:08,560
Okay.

946
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,800
I'm looking at Garfield right now.

947
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,120
I feel like... No, I think this works.

948
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:13,960
Honestly.

949
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,820
It's basically him.

950
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,780
Guys, I can't make him fatter!

951
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,320
If I could, I would!

952
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,780
The best I could do is make his cheeks fatter!

953
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,960
That's the best I can!

954
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,480
Feed him!

955
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,360
Please!

956
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,280
He's so hungry!

957
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,160
Feed him!

958
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,320
Okay, how about like...

959
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,720
Oh, this is like... John, I'm so hungry.

960
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,420
I'm sorry, John.

961
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,880
I was just so hungry.

962
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:55,100
Okay, this is Garfield, but like he got found a catnip.

963
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:56,540
Okay, here.

964
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,780
There you go.

965
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,160
Garfield, but he found catnip.

966
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,640
Alright, iris colors.

967
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,880
What is... What are Garfield's eye color?

968
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:09,600
Green, right?

969
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,960
Yeah, there you go.

970
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,000
I'm so hungry, John.

971
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,140
I'm so hungry.

972
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,560
Okay, there you go.

973
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,100
Now he's cute.

974
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:19,900
Now he's cute!

975
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,180
Now he's cute!

976
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,560
Guys, look at that.

977
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,100
Look at that.

978
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,880
He's very hungry, but like, now he's pretty cute!

979
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,480
Alright, nice.

980
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,000
We did it.

981
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,200
We figured it out, guys.

982
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,980
We got Garfield at home.

983
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,420
I am trying my best right now!

984
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,840
I am...

985
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,880
Look at him!

986
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,720
Look, there's Garfield!

987
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,140
Look at him!

988
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,480
Yesterday was Leah's birthday.

989
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,620
Can you wish her a happy birthday too?

990
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,120
Of course!

991
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:49,980
Like, who else does?

992
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,440

Cool.

998
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,480

999
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,280
Okay, yes.

1002
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,460
Okay, wait.

1003
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:20,420
Wait, okay.

1004
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,060
Walmart Garfield.

1005
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,280
Not Garfield!

1006
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,920
Wait, what should I do?

1007
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,440
Not Garfield!

1008
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:34,900
Alright.

1009
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,800
Happy birthday to you!

1010
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,840
Happy birthday to you!

1011
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,020
Happy birthday to Gar...

1012
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:41,720
I mean, Leah!

1013
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,220
Happy birthday to you!

1014
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:44,860
Yeah!

1015
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:45,820
Happy birthday!

1016
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,620
Ninja, thank you for the super chat!

1017
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:50,040
Thank you!

1018
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:50,700
Thank you!

1019
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,740
Has opportunity to make dad in game.

1020
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,260
Chooses to make Garfield instead.

1021
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,900
This is why he loves the babysitter.

1022
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,220
Thank you for the super chat!

1023
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:00,720
Thank you!

1024
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,300
Not Garfield!

1025
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,840
Is this name okay?

1026
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:08,620
Yes.

1027
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,280
Select the amount of tutorials.

1028
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,520
Just all of them.

1029
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:12,120
Okay.

1030
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,480
Start the game with these, yes.

1031
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,380
There's my Garfield!

1032
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,900
It's okay, I get like a dog, right?

1033
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,920
Do I get a dog in this game?

1034
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,160
I'll just name that dog after dad.

1035
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,440
That's me in 1900s.

1036
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,280
Hello!

1037
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,090
I'm sorry, every time I look at myself.

1038
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:01,610
We don't have to raise it up.

1039
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,510
That's so old!

1040
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:22,950
I'm so locked in!

1041
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:31,430
No, dog Chocobo instead.

1042
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:33,270
Thank you for the super chat!

1043
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:34,130
Thank you!

1044
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,030
I'm young at heart, guys.

1045
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,030
Look at my pigtails.

1046
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:02,110
I'm so tired.

1047
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,290
I'm so tired.

1048
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:04,710
I'm feeling sad.

1049
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:08,430
I feel like a 130 year old granny.

1050
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:15,990
I raised the volume up.

1051
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,050
I'll bring the music down later.

1052
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,610
A monster?

1053
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:34,470
A monster in Monster Hunter?

1054
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:35,590
No fucking way!

1055
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:52,550
Oh my god, me?

1056
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,090
It's because of my experience, right?

1057
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,480
I know!

1058
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:12,760
Lead hunter level 1?

1059
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,340
Bro, I turned on every tutorial.

1060
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,820
How am I the lead hunter?

1061
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,140
Every tutorial was turned on.

1062
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,400
I don't know what I'm doing.

1063
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:32,370
Who are you?

1064
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,670
This is my cat, Garfield.

1065
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:40,810
Sorry.

1066
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:47,190
Your daughter looks like a mother who tries to act young.

1067
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:49,030
To bond with her daughter.

1068
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:53,050
Thank you for the superchat, Sleepy.

1069
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,510
Thank you, thank you.

1070
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:57,670
Am I back in Sandland?

1071
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:59,030
Do I ever leave Sandland?

1072
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:08,090
I wonder what Garfield would say if I turned on the voice.

1073
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:09,230
What would he be like?

1074
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:09,850
He's like, hey!

1075
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,020
I wonder what he'd say.

1076
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,520
Oh, where are they chasing?

1077
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,260
What is that?

1078
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,600
Oh my god, it's a child!

1079
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,240
Am I going to steal her pet?

1080
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,720
I hate Monday.

1081
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:53,960
I'm going to steal...

1082
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,060
I'm going to carjack your ride.

1083
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,900
It's GTA now.

1084
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:07,170
Get the child off of that ride.

1085
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:16,470
Wait, there were subtitles to his meows?

1086
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:17,770
Okay, that's pretty funny.

1087
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,530
Wait, the child's gone.

1088
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:29,410
Wait, where did the child go?

1089
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:32,750
Oh shit, I'm playing!

1090
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:36,530
Oh, okay guys.

1091
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:38,530
Oh, I can't pause?

1092
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:41,610
Oh my god, it's a multiplayer game!

1093
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:42,670
I can't pause!

1094
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:47,070
Oh, this is a different bird?

1095
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,510
Oh my god, you can't pause!

1096
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:52,750
It's multiplayer now!

1097
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:53,470
It's online!

1098
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:56,570
This is so weird!

1099
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,360
What do I do?

1100
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,100
Oh, I just jump up.

1101
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,100
Oh my god, the sensitivity is so high.

1102
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:16,200
Okay, I was not ready to not pause.

1103
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,500
Wait, I can fly!

1104
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,180
Come on, Garfiel, let's go.

1105
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,580
Let's take her car.

1106
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,000
Oh, okay, well I guess she's dead now.

1107
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,200
Wait, grab the screamer car?

1108
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:36,500
Aim?

1109
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,700
Yeah, I did it.

1110
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:43,920
Wait, what?

1111
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,100
Did I do it?

1112
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,680
I did it!

1113
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,900
Alright, nice.

1114
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,300
Alright, Garfiel, you can drive, right?

1115
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,660
Of course he can.

1116
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:02,880
Of course he can drive.

1117
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,040
Oh, I can kill him.

1118
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,360
Okay, aim, shoot.

1119
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:08,600
Okay.

1120
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,260
Okay.

1121
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,600
And then I drag him in.

1122
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,600
And then I go...

1123
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,240
There we go.

1124
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,520
But just, like, do that.

1125
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,020
Yeah, alright.

1126
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,600
Oh, I don't have unlimited!

1127
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,580
It's not unlimited, guys!

1128
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,580
Guys, it's not unlimited!

1129
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:31,500
Whoops!

1130
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,740
Whoops!

1131
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,940
I...

1132
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,340
Guys!

1133
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,120
Guys, it's not unlimited!

1134
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:40,840
It's like pew pew!

1135
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,600
Pew pew!

1136
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,680
Pew pew!

1137
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,420
You don't say!

1138
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,080
Guys, now I know.

1139
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,360
Nice.

1140
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,280
Easy.

1141
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:56,640
Alright.

1142
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:56,840
Okay.

1143
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,280
I realized, like, at the bottom, right?

1144
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,200
It was, like, one out of six.

1145
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,460
And I was like, one out of...

1146
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,560
Wait, what do you mean one out of six?

1147
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,020
Check out the monsters.

1148
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:11,760
Ten!

1149
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,660
Alright, nice.

1150
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:21,740
Oh, I got my blade!

1151
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:30,950
Don't worry.

1152
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:34,890
I have 120 years of experience.

1153
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,720
Sage, welcome to the mail farm!

1154
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,400
Welcome, welcome!

1155
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,520
Who taught you how to drive, little girl?

1156
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,980
There are people here.

1157
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,680
Oh, you speak...

1158
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,740
You speak English!

1159
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,240
Yeah,

1160
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:38,640
what is it?

1161
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:47,940
Oh, shit.

1162
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:59,000
I didn't realize the voice did not match at all.

1163
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,620
Every time I look at her, I can't...

1164
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,600
I don't think he's alive.

1165
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:10,940
I'll be your new brother.

1166
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,340
We'll leave some supplies for you.

1167
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,220
I'll keep an eye on these two.

1168
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:22,760
We're moving out.

1169
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,540
Alright, music and sound effects by 15.

1170
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:25,940
Okay.

1171
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:34,050
Why the fuck he doesn't understand you?

1172
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:37,710
Come with me, okay?

1173
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:41,110
Oh, it's the little plushie that I had!

1174
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:46,410
How the fuck would he understand you?

1175
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:56,230
Yeah.

1176
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:57,470
Yeah, of course the cats do.

1177
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,410
The cats literally build a fucking village.

1178
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:02,390
The dog speaks English?!

1179
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:05,870
Who allowed them?

1180
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:08,250
Alright.

1181
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:10,350
Okay, let's fix this.

1182
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:11,730
God, it was so weird.

1183
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:13,390
I was like, what the fuck?

1184
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:14,650
I couldn't...

1185
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:17,730
Let's see...

1186
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:19,510
Options...

1187
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:20,690
God, that was so weird.

1188
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,070
I can't pause the game.

1189
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:25,430
Uh, BGM volume...

1190
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:27,510
Turn it down to 67.

1191
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:29,610
Turn it down to 67.

1192
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:32,450
Voice volume is maxed up.

1193
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:35,850
We know they're friends.

1194
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:38,950
Alright, uh...

1195
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:39,930
Alright, that should be good.

1196
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:44,250
Yeah, but you have to click pause for that.

1197
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:45,450
I'm not used to that.

1198
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:48,470
Okay, let me grab the sensitivity.

1199
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:51,210
It was so high.

1200
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:52,150
Holy shit.

1201
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:52,470
Okay.

1202
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:53,990
Keyboard and mouse.

1203
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:57,270
Where is...

1204
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:58,350
Is there...

1205
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,170
Is there sensitivity?

1206
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:01,130
Oh, camera sensitivity.

1207
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:03,690
Uh...

1208
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:05,770
We'll do it at maybe like 6.

1209
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:07,630
Maybe that'll be better.

1210
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:11,110
No, it's still a little bit too high.

1211
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:14,470
Wait, is this the sensitivity?

1212
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:19,790
No, it's not.

1213
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,500
It's not the sensitivity.

1214
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:32,180
Still pretty high.

1215
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:35,420
Uh...

1216
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,420
Yeah, but you don't have mouse...

1217
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,320
Oh, camera shake.

1218
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,200
Let me put that down.

1219
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,300
I don't like the camera shake.

1220
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,160
I guess it's this, right?

1221
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:43,900
Aiming?

1222
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,840
Yeah, but like...

1223
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,300
Where else would it be, though?

1224
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,380
It's not camera.

1225
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,500
Controllers and all...

1226
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,200
Is it this one?

1227
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,960
There's no sensitivity here.

1228
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:03,780
There's no...

1229
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,400
There's no sensitivity on this.

1230
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:11,780
It is?

1231
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:14,760
Scroll down?

1232
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:19,050
No, this is...

1233
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,510
Oh, maybe it's page 2.

1234
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:21,190
Oh!

1235
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:22,930
No.

1236
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:26,090
No, it's still the same.

1237
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,180
Yeah, because this is...

1238
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:33,300
This is for controller, and we don't need controller.

1239
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,000
JK, we lied.

1240
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:36,480
I know.

1241
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,140
I'll just turn this down.

1242
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,260
And see if that works.

1243
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,500
Usually, you turn this down.

1244
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,680
It should be fine.

1245
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:49,560
Uh...

1246
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,180
It's like, I don't like how...

1247
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:57,900
That's alright.

1248
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:58,160
Alright.

1249
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:00,000
Let's see.

1250
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,000
Oh, I can adjust to that.

1251
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,080
I think that's fine, right?

1252
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,040
That should be fine.

1253
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,940
Let's double check if I saved everything.

1254
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:09,440
Alright.

1255
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:11,600
Hello!

1256
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:14,960
No?

1257
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,040
Okay.

1258
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,260
Okay.

1259
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:27,920
Not yet.

1260
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:35,700
Okay.

1261
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:42,930
Uh...

1262
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:45,390
More quick, the best offense is a good...

1263
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:46,390
That...

1264
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:49,630
Oh, wait, I prefer to take my aim at my target from a distance.

1265
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:50,450
Yeah, that's true.

1266
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:54,010
I like to switch between ammo.

1267
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:54,850
I prefer to wait.

1268
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:57,350
I like to weave around while keeping...

1269
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:58,830
I like to wait for it to open and then attack.

1270
01:02:58,970 --> 01:02:59,950
I like to switch between...

1271
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,330
I like this one, the first one.

1272
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:08,010
Light bowgun?

1273
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:10,950
I'll pick a weapon up myself.

1274
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:12,930
Alright, let's try.

1275
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:14,130
Alright.

1276
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:16,930
That...

1277
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:18,990
With mobile...

1278
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:19,410
What was it?

1279
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:21,350
Someone said I should try gunlance.

1280
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:22,990
Should I try light bowgun?

1281
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:25,850
With mid-range, good for quick fire.

1282
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:29,030
Rapid fire lets you expand energy to fire multiple rounds of ammo.

1283
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:30,750
Guarding.

1284
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:31,290
None.

1285
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:32,750
Okay.

1286
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:38,570
Has a variety of arrow attacks and focus on mobility.

1287
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:40,850
Charging arrows will increase size and allows you to move away.

1288
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:41,750
Guarding.

1289
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:42,290
None.

1290
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:43,630
Gunlance is fun.

1291
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:45,310
Long-reaching thrust.

1292
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:46,730
No shellfire.

1293
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,710
Has low mobility but great guarding capabilities.

1294
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:51,770
And supports a variety...

1295
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:52,110
Ooh.

1296
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:53,770
Ooh.

1297
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:55,890
Guarding capabilities.

1298
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:56,950
Hmm.

1299
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:04,110
Guarding capabilities.

1300
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:11,070
Has a powerful long...

1301
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:12,470
Um...

1302
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:17,590
Long-distance, short-based, expands energy to fire low mobility but...

1303
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:18,330
I wanna try...

1304
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:19,810
I'll try light bowgun.

1305
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:22,710
I'm gonna try this.

1306
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:24,530
I wanna see what that is like.

1307
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:27,350
Or the bow.

1308
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:27,990
Okay, guys.

1309
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:30,090
Light bowgun or the bow, guys?

1310
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:34,990
You wanna shoot and dodge?

1311
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:39,130
We don't block in this house, exactly.

1312
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:40,610
I'll try...

1313
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,810
I'll try light bowgun first, then.

1314
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:44,430
Uh...

1315
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:45,490
Bow is more fun?

1316
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:46,230
Is it actually?

1317
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:50,210
Charging arrows will increase their power size and allows you to move away.

1318
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:52,450
Which one is more fun?

1319
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:54,330
And test both?

1320
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:55,270
Okay, I'll test both.

1321
01:04:56,290 --> 01:04:56,990
I'll test both.

1322
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:01,070
Oh, equipped it.

1323
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:07,170
What am I...

1324
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:08,210
What am I doing?

1325
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:10,830
How do I bring it out?

1326
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:12,890
How do I bring out my weapon?

1327
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:15,590
Oh, there we go.

1328
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:20,190
Reload.

1329
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:23,910
Oh, there it is!

1330
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:24,310
Okay.

1331
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,390
Aim, focus, switch modes, evade.

1332
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:28,490
Okay.

1333
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:30,890
Uh, focus blast?

1334
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:36,190
Oh, I see.

1335
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:36,690
Okay.

1336
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:38,710
And then...

1337
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:39,950
Switch modes.

1338
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:41,830
What's my mode?

1339
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:43,150
Oh, shit.

1340
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:43,570
Okay.

1341
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:45,410
What's this mode?

1342
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:48,710
And this is normal ammo.

1343
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:49,330
Okay.

1344
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:53,130
Okay.

1345
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:54,750
Let's see.

1346
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:56,410
Special, R, and F?

1347
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:05,920
Oh, shit!

1348
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:07,300
What the fuck is that?

1349
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,780
What is that?

1350
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,100
What did I make?

1351
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,320
Oh, it's a mine!

1352
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,860
Oh, okay.

1353
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,680
I was like, the fuck did I make?

1354
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,780
Alright, I wanna try the bow now.

1355
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:24,340
Hello, ma'am.

1356
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,580
How do I try the bow?

1357
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:28,940
Uh...

1358
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:30,600
I wanna try the bow.

1359
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:31,520
Let's see how I feel.

1360
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,420
Uh, okay.

1361
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:38,260
Aim slinger, ready weapon.

1362
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:39,520
Okay.

1363
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,560
What the fuck?

1364
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:40,860
Okay.

1365
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,600
What if, like...

1366
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,770
Okay, if I hold it straight up...

1367
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:50,020
Quick shot.

1368
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,560
Quick shot...

1369
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,760
Dragon piercer?

1370
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:57,560
Oh my god!

1371
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,180
That's a big-ass bow!

1372
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:02,980
Hellstorm?

1373
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:06,910
Charging sidestep.

1374
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:11,890
Charging sidestep?

1375
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:13,570
How do I use...

1376
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,920
Oh, okay.

1377
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:18,160
Okay.

1378
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,180
Jesus Christ, there's so many!

1379
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,040
I need a barrel?

1380
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:24,640
There's a barrel?

1381
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,980
Oh, it's out of range.

1382
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:32,230
Okay.

1383
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:35,270
Uh...

1384
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:37,510
Charging sidestep.

1385
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:38,510
Quick shot.

1386
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,820
I don't know if I like...

1387
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:44,820
Bow is easier?

1388
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,040
You don't need to farm ammo?

1389
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:46,800
Ooh, maybe.

1390
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:49,660
I think I like the bow actually more.

1391
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:53,320
Charge shot, then press F.

1392
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,960
Charge shot, then press F.

1393
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:57,860
Oh!

1394
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,960
Jesus Christ!

1395
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,220
What am I looking at?

1396
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:06,780
What am I- Holy shit!

1397
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:08,900
There's so many combos!

1398
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,780
Oh my god!

1399
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,020
I don't know!

1400
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:18,140
They both look really interesting.

1401
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,320
I can't tell.

1402
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,440
They both look incredibly interesting.

1403
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,920
How do I get this out of my screen?

1404
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:30,510
Alright.

1405
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:33,390
Alright, guys.

1406
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:35,430
Bow and lobe, I don't know.

1407
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:38,130
They both look pretty interesting, so I can't tell.

1408
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:41,270
I don't know.

1409
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:46,670
I can carry both?

1410
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:50,390
I don't know.

1411
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:51,110
I like both of them.

1412
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:53,830
Because one is a gun.

1413
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:57,490
Which one?

1414
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:58,370
Am I switching mode?

1415
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:03,300
Because one is a gun.

1416
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,760
And then there's like...

1417
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,020
A melee weapon?

1418
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,420
Okay, let's see.

1419
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:15,620
So many combos!

1420
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:16,540
It's Capcom!

1421
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:18,120
Oh my god, it's another fighter.

1422
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:19,960
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

1423
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,500
Oh, the classic.

1424
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:23,500
This is the one that I know.

1425
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:26,160
This was the classic.

1426
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:28,260
All I did was just do this.

1427
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,000
And then... Demon Mode!

1428
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,000
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

1429
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:32,980
And I missed the barrel.

1430
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,480
Demon Mode!

1431
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,920
This was the easiest one.

1432
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,040
This is what I know.

1433
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:48,420
It was so easy.

1434
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:51,540
This is literally the easiest one.

1435
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:56,530
It still works.

1436
01:09:58,470 --> 01:09:58,810
Okay.

1437
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:02,130
I'll try bow.

1438
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:04,470
I'll do it.

1439
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:06,910
Okay.

1440
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:12,990
Tap mount to mount your move automatically towards your objective.

1441
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,910
You will return to auto-move after some time.

1442
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:18,530
Or you can reactivate it with tap.

1443
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:19,670
Okay, auto-move with tap.

1444
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:23,690
Wait, actually...

1445
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,270
Can I get off?

1446
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:27,930
Oh, I can't.

1447
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:28,570
They won't let me.

1448
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:30,710
Okay.

1449
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:31,930
Auto-move.

1450
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:32,870
You move for me.

1451
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:37,280
Alright, go!

1452
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,220
Move for me!

1453
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,680
Oh, I can pick up mushrooms!

1454
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:42,660
Let me pick it up.

1455
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:44,300
Alright.

1456
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:53,690
Hello?

1457
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:56,290
What did he say, Garfield?

1458
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,700
Oh, I can?

1459
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:09,920
Oh, shit!

1460
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:11,880
Oh, is that the brother?

1461
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,180
Hello!

1462
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:15,520
Woah!

1463
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,140
Getting a little freaky!

1464
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:18,420
Woah!

1465
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,640
The Chaka Kabar!

1466
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:38,270
You know, I'm just confused why he licked him instead of just eating him straight up.

1467
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:39,510
Like, that's just a hobby.

1468
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:48,480
Like, he's definitely playing with his food.

1469
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:50,720
Oh, shit!

1470
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:51,660
I did that.

1471
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:08,620
Bro, just like, take down his like, the little packages that he has.

1472
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:09,980
Oh, shit.

1473
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:10,360
Okay.

1474
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,240
Don't worry.

1475
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,200
I trained for this.

1476
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,440
Gather and consume.

1477
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,380
Don't worry.

1478
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:18,720
Um...

1479
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:19,640
Ready weapon.

1480
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:20,460
Don't worry.

1481
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,780
Don't worry, I got this.

1482
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:26,500
Oh, fuck!

1483
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:27,440
Oh, shit!

1484
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,080
Okay, don't worry, I got this.

1485
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:30,960
Garfield, help me!

1486
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,460
I can't do combos!

1487
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,420
Okay, don't worry.

1488
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,280
Don't worry, I don't know how to do combos yet.

1489
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,300
I'm just trying to figure out how to survive.

1490
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,580
Oh, shit, no!

1491
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,540
I forgot about stamina!

1492
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,540
Oh, shit, Garfield!

1493
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,920
I forgot about stamina, Garfield!

1494
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,800
Okay, don't worry, I got this.

1495
01:12:58,840 --> 01:12:59,620
Don't worry.

1496
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,240
Okay, good.

1497
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,020
Good bait, Garfield.

1498
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:03,600
Good bait.

1499
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:05,880
Okay, nice.

1500
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,360
Oh, shit!

1501
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:09,700
Stamina!

1502
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:15,370
Please, shoot!

1503
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:19,290
Alright.

1504
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:21,290
Nice.

1505
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:22,930
Good job!

1506
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:25,530
Oh, I need to stop doing that.

1507
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:28,130
Okay, hellstorm.

1508
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:30,850
Nice.

1509
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:33,430
What can I do now?

1510
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:39,080
Don't worry.

1511
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:40,940
I'm gonna do it.

1512
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,020
I'm gonna do it all the way here.

1513
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,940
Oh, I could have...

1514
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:45,560
Oh, that's alright.

1515
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,080
I definitely know what I'm doing, guys.

1516
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:53,670
Don't worry.

1517
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:00,690
I think...

1518
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:01,950
I think I know what I'm doing.

1519
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:04,350
Repeating attack in the same part opens a wound.

1520
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:06,070
Wait, he has a wound?

1521
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:08,170
Use focus mode to target?

1522
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:10,410
Oh, it's right here.

1523
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:11,890
Nice, I got it.

1524
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:13,550
His leg is broken.

1525
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:16,610
Garfield, please!

1526
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:20,150
Wait, what the fuck?

1527
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:22,090
There we go.

1528
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:24,870
I got it.

1529
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:27,390
That's right.

1530
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:28,890
I missed all of those shots somehow.

1531
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:29,870
I don't know how.

1532
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:34,830
Guys, do you think my one hit damage is doing enough?

1533
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:36,210
He's alright.

1534
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:36,770
Look at him.

1535
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:37,550
He's full HP.

1536
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:40,830
He's so healthy.

1537
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:42,610
Nice.

1538
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:45,230
Shift while holding to perform a focus strike.

1539
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:47,470
If the attack hits a wound, it'll destroy it.

1540
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:47,670
Okay.

1541
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:00,110
There we go.

1542
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:03,910
I figured it out.

1543
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:08,020
There we go.

1544
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:09,940
There we go.

1545
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,580
I think I'm doing it.

1546
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,360
I'm sorry!

1547
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,820
I keep trying to fucking...

1548
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,240
I'm trying to feed!

1549
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,540
Get your fucking bow out!

1550
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,420
Wait, did he...

1551
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:31,920
Is he gone?

1552
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:35,080
There's just no one firing from this system.

1553
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,220
So try to keep the reticle orange.

1554
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,160
Wait, is he gone?

1555
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:43,920
Apply a coating by consuming the trick arrow.

1556
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,220
Select coating.

1557
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:47,220
Oh, I can select coatings.

1558
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,300
Oh my god.

1559
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,500
I want this item.

1560
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:51,820
Give me a sec.

1561
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:53,940
I'm trying to...

1562
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:54,920
How do I pick it up?

1563
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,140
How do I...

1564
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:00,080
Oh, there it is.

1565
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,640
Oh, I have to sheath my weapon.

1566
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:03,380
I hope Garfiel's okay.

1567
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:08,840
Garfiel, are you okay there?

1568
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:14,450
I hope he's okay.

1569
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:20,570
Oh.

1570
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,450
I'll take that.

1571
01:16:23,730 --> 01:16:24,330
Deliberate.

1572
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:28,210
Hold E to press to shoot a trace.

1573
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:29,410
The next arrow should attract a trace.

1574
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:29,830
Oh!

1575
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:33,550
Oh shit, Garfiel, I'm sorry!

1576
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:34,890
Oh, I'm sorry!

1577
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:40,660
Oh, I hope he's okay!

1578
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,320
My bad!

1579
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,380
I was looting!

1580
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,080
I'm so looting!

1581
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:49,940
I'm sorry!

1582
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,880
Oh shit.

1583
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:55,480
John!

1584
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,800
John, please!

1585
01:16:58,420 --> 01:16:59,280
I was looting!

1586
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,240
I'm sorry!

1587
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,500
I'm sorry!

1588
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:12,320
Oh shit.

1589
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:14,660
Oh no.

1590
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,680
I have an SOS flare?

1591
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:28,320
You can request help from our fire and hunting party consists of a certain amount of passes after it, but no other support hunters will come to your aid from other units to help you hunt.

1592
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,020
Oh my god.

1593
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:31,480
Oh my god, I think I'll need it.

1594
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:33,800
How do I do it?

1595
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:35,660
What?

1596
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,140
Where's my SOS?

1597
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:40,800
Control, open.

1598
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,620
How do I...

1599
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:44,880
Oh, there it is.

1600
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:45,820
Alright.

1601
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:46,200
Alright.

1602
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,420
Help me.

1603
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:49,740
Okay.

1604
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:55,200
Guess I don't need help.

1605
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,080
Alright, mining time.

1606
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:01,600
Okay.

1607
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:02,500
Well.

1608
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:08,800
I'll need help, guys.

1609
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,740
Let's kill these guys.

1610
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,220
Oh, you should be dead, right?

1611
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,200
Can I farm you?

1612
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,400
Oh shit, I should grab...

1613
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,260
I should kill him first.

1614
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:26,940
Alright.

1615
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,180
Game said no help.

1616
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:31,340
No help.

1617
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:35,000
Okay.

1618
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:40,520
Oh,

1619
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:46,580
there you go.

1620
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,020
Okay, let's kill these guys first, though.

1621
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,460
Let's kill these guys first.

1622
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:55,420
Alright.

1623
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:57,180
Goodbye.

1624
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,200
Okay, now we can do this.

1625
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,940
That's right!

1626
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,940
That's fucking right!

1627
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,720
Get hunted!

1628
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:14,020
Oh shit.

1629
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:15,840
Jesus Christ.

1630
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:18,060
This guy takes forever to kill.

1631
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:21,260
Go Garfield, go!

1632
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:24,600
Okay, wait.

1633
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,120
Oh, fuck!

1634
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:27,600
Dodged.

1635
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:29,740
Don't worry.

1636
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:32,440
I have Garfield to take my shots for me.

1637
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:34,500
Garfield, please!

1638
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:35,280
Garfield, please!

1639
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:36,200
Garfield, please!

1640
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:37,420
No, he licked me!

1641
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:41,100
Okay.

1642
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:42,460
We got this.

1643
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:46,760
How

1644
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:51,610
is he still alive?

1645
01:19:52,530 --> 01:19:54,930
Wait, where did these mosquitoes come from?

1646
01:19:57,050 --> 01:19:57,630
Alright.

1647
01:19:58,370 --> 01:19:59,710
Am I doing it?

1648
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:00,610
I can't tell.

1649
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:05,050
Guys, am I doing okay?

1650
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:09,230
Oh shit!

1651
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:10,130
No, I am.

1652
01:20:10,490 --> 01:20:13,010
No, I am 100% doing okay.

1653
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:13,610
Look at that.

1654
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:16,890
Oh my god!

1655
01:20:16,990 --> 01:20:18,970
Okay, that was cool.

1656
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:21,670
Oh!

1657
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:22,710
And I can do it again.

1658
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:28,230
Oh, and again!

1659
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:32,550
And again!

1660
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:34,510
Wait, wait, wait.

1661
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:35,530
Get back over here.

1662
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:37,310
Wait, okay.

1663
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:37,810
Don't worry.

1664
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:40,290
I am figuring this out, guys.

1665
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,830
He is running back like a pussy.

1666
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:44,770
Get back here, you pussy.

1667
01:20:46,330 --> 01:20:47,770
Back over here.

1668
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:48,840
Fight back!

1669
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:49,690
Wait.

1670
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:51,730
Give me a sec.

1671
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:53,750
I am going to mind your friend right here.

1672
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:58,590
Alright, okay.

1673
01:20:58,690 --> 01:21:00,770
Bring up the game volume by...

1674
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:02,630
Alright.

1675
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:04,770
Game volume by...

1676
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:09,030
Up by 7.

1677
01:21:09,730 --> 01:21:10,770
And then...

1678
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:12,370
Sound effects and music down.

1679
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:12,790
Okay.

1680
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:14,830
By 10.

1681
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:18,070
Alright, nice.

1682
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:19,370
That should be good.

1683
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:20,910
Alright, Garfield, let's go.

1684
01:21:21,770 --> 01:21:22,670
Let's kill this guy.

1685
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:24,550
What a fucking pussy.

1686
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:27,750
We don't need our bird.

1687
01:21:30,370 --> 01:21:31,930
He is like right there.

1688
01:21:32,290 --> 01:21:32,970
Oh, he is dead.

1689
01:21:35,410 --> 01:21:37,330
How do I kill him in his sleep?

1690
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:39,950
I do.

1691
01:21:39,950 --> 01:21:40,910
What do I do?

1692
01:21:41,390 --> 01:21:43,090
What do I just do?

1693
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:46,450
Is that fucked?

1694
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:55,230
Okay.

1695
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,170
Nice.

1696
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:04,070
That was pretty fucked up.

1697
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:06,350
Never saw it coming.

1698
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:07,970
Let's go.

1699
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:13,610
That shot right there.

1700
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:14,890
Nice.

1701
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:17,790
Good shot.

1702
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:20,530
They never see it coming.

1703
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:22,070
That's right.

1704
01:22:22,190 --> 01:22:23,310
The best part.

1705
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:25,670
Killing them in no honor.

1706
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:26,470
Toki.

1707
01:22:26,830 --> 01:22:29,610
That wasn't even a 1v1.

1708
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:31,050
What the fuck?

1709
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:35,830
Alright, go.

1710
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:35,890
Go.

1711
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:41,170
Where does my tab tell me to go to?

1712
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:43,630
Oh, I can end quest immediately.

1713
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:47,110
Murdered while sleeping.

1714
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,530
Just casually blew his head off.

1715
01:22:55,730 --> 01:22:58,350
I think he needs an ibuprofen.

1716
01:22:58,970 --> 01:23:00,790
AKB, thank you for the super chat.

1717
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:01,990
Thank you, thank you.

1718
01:23:02,290 --> 01:23:03,870
Alright, I think...

1719
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:06,470
I think I learned a lot from that.

1720
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:08,670
I think I did pretty well for my first hunt.

1721
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:12,530
This is the hunter way.

1722
01:23:12,710 --> 01:23:13,070
Exactly.

1723
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:17,270
I think I did really well for my first hunt.

1724
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:18,930
Alright.

1725
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:23,470
I have auto-movement.

1726
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:25,530
I did it.

1727
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:26,150
I made it.

1728
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:45,380
I did it, guys.

1729
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:46,300
I killed him.

1730
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,090
He's just like, what?

1731
01:24:03,930 --> 01:24:05,410
Yeah, I killed him in a sleep.

1732
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:15,380
I'm a hot grandma, that's how.

1733
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:25,680
Hot and strong.

1734
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:27,120
Do my six pack.

1735
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:28,760
You wanna see my six pack?

1736
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:30,440
Little boy.

1737
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,600
With the power of high.

1738
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:38,400
High power.

1739
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:43,120
Don't kid, no.

1740
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:00,950
Imagine if they could talk.

1741
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:01,950
That'd be so wrong.

1742
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:05,390
And I would make sure that would never happen.

1743
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:11,250
Yeah,

1744
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:17,440
imagine.

1745
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,980
No, no.

1746
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:24,740
In my world, they never evolved past that.

1747
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,420
This is a pretty well protected spot.

1748
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,420
We could do a lot worse for an interim camp.

1749
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:31,640
This way.

1750
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:33,740
Let the cat speak.

1751
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:36,980
I'm telling you, we just need some space.

1752
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,160
She's fine.

1753
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,640
But she needs...

1754
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,540
Which we're perfectly capable of.

1755
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:44,060
Nona!

1756
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:45,420
Huh?

1757
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:46,580
Hey, Cy!

1758
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:47,520
You're okay!

1759
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:51,720
Thank the winds.

1760
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:54,460
Stop preventing their progress.

1761
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:01,540
If they learn to talk, what's gonna stop them from hunting us?

1762
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:16,110
Guys, I was born in a different time.

1763
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:17,630
I was born in 1900s, guys.

1764
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:28,110
And I grew up in the village.

1765
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:31,130
My name is Nona.

1766
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:34,450
It's wonderful to meet you.

1767
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:35,330
I'm Alma.

1768
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:38,030
The others and I are here on a search.

1769
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:40,350
We're from a place far out west.

1770
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:45,130
Back when cats couldn't talk.

1771
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:48,490
Guys.

1772
01:26:49,650 --> 01:26:52,070
Back in my day, the cats couldn't talk.

1773
01:26:58,010 --> 01:27:01,050
Oh, they spoke in meows!

1774
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:03,810
It's Rhyme!

1775
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:34,810
You mean my bow?

1776
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:36,750
It's a fucking bow!

1777
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:38,730
Do you not have bows?

1778
01:27:40,570 --> 01:27:43,990
Like, it's just a giant fucking bow!

1779
01:27:44,710 --> 01:27:46,590
It's not that special!

1780
01:27:50,490 --> 01:27:54,190
I didn't understand it, but it was like a giant fucking gun lancer.

1781
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:59,490
Do you not use tools?

1782
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:02,910
How do you make your clothes?

1783
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:09,770
They never seen a giant bow, Doki.

1784
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:12,790
It's literally a bow, but they made it bigger.

1785
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:15,050
Like, what's the difference?

1786
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:17,070
Okay, what's your village?

1787
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:26,470
Slurp, thank you for the superchat, thank you, thank you.

1788
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:29,010
I'm putting a lot of you in front of me, that's my Doki!

1789
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:32,190
Thank you for the superchat, thank you, thank you.

1790
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:47,610
We better weed on him, because it's impractical!

1791
01:28:54,270 --> 01:29:01,190
I don't remember ever hearing that name before, but her elder, she might know something.

1792
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,340
Alright, can you tell us more about your... yeah.

1793
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:16,360
It must be a village of pacifists.

1794
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,120
Should be easy to take down.

1795
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:19,480
Oh my god, you're right!

1796
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:23,100
I could take over this village with my giant fucking bow!

1797
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,980
Oh my god, they're defenseless!

1798
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:33,500
It's time!

1799
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:42,320
I'm not just hunting monsters!

1800
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,080
I'm here to expand an empire!

1801
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:08,640
God, he's... why don't we have a look around base camp?

1802
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,880
Who taught you how to talk, Garfield?

1803
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:19,770
Who gave you subtitles, Garfield?

1804
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:21,750
You're just here to be cute!

1805
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:26,690
Alright, obtain new award, obtain new backgrounds.

1806
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:27,370
Nice!

1807
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:30,350
Wait, I should have, like, extra armor now, right?

1808
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,710
It's just a thought, Bubbles!

1809
01:30:37,210 --> 01:30:38,750
Nice meeting you!

1810
01:30:38,910 --> 01:30:39,810
Okay, what's this?

1811
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:50,210
It was me, Barry!

1812
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:52,090
I gave your cat subtitles!

1813
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:54,010
What is this?

1814
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:02,890
Alright, uh... what's your role?

1815
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:05,150
Yeah, what's your job here?

1816
01:31:14,410 --> 01:31:14,970
Okay...

1817
01:31:16,030 --> 01:31:17,670
Can I recruit more cats?

1818
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:24,790
I know, like, in other games, you can, like, grab more cats to send out for quests.

1819
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:32,990
Only get one cat?

1820
01:31:34,330 --> 01:31:38,690
Man, back in the 1900s, I could have multiple cats.

1821
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:45,930
Now we just get one cat.

1822
01:31:52,690 --> 01:31:53,490
Okay, Doki.

1823
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:03,000
The high performance barrel punch is a perfect trainer to practice using different weapons.

1824
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:03,800
Huh?

1825
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:15,000
You used to be able to, like... I was gonna say you used to be able to buy more cats, but I realized that sounded so bad.

1826
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,020
I'm sorry!

1827
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,400
I was like, but it was true in the other games!

1828
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:22,860
You can, like, improve your cats!

1829
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:27,200
No, cause, like, they'll have stronger cats that you can buy!

1830
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:30,340
So, like, you can get stronger cats!

1831
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:32,280
Like, it's not bad!

1832
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,240
It's in the game!

1833
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:37,280
It's in the game, I swear to God!

1834
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:41,980
I swear to God, you can... it's true!

1835
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:44,760
It's not me, it's the game!

1836
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:48,180
It sounds so bad!

1837
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:49,020
They're cats!

1838
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,400
You all buy cats!

1839
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:52,340
You don't judge me!

1840
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,180
You all pay for your cats!

1841
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,400
You're a paid cat and you bought that cat!

1842
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:08,500
Doki, stop talking.

1843
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:17,820
Um, actually, I think... Oh, so you kidnap cats out in the wild!

1844
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:20,400
How is that better than what I do?

1845
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:22,620
At least I pay them a wage!

1846
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:25,420
Like, at least I employ them!

1847
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:28,340
You just pick up a random cat off the streets!

1848
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:30,160
What if that cat has a family?

1849
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,320
I'm okay.

1850
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:47,100
I was so surprised when you jumped off the boat onto that bird thing!

1851
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,200
That was amazing!

1852
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:51,700
Apologies with tears wet!

1853
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:54,360
Thank you for the superchat!

1854
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:55,700
Thank you, thank you!

1855
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:02,580
Okay, tell me about... Okay, I don't want to learn more about you.

1856
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,020
I want to know more about the cats.

1857
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:08,120
So my Oshichi made graduation.

1858
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:10,920
Thank you for the superchat!

1859
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:12,420
Thank you, thank you!

1860
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:14,440
Yes, Garfield gets paid!

1861
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,460
Garfield, are you happy?

1862
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,440
Look at that!

1863
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,620
Look at him carrying all my loot!

1864
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:21,740
He's so happy!

1865
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:22,520
Look at him!

1866
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:24,260
He's happy!

1867
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:25,780
I even clothed him!

1868
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,240
Some of them are naked!

1869
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:28,580
Look at him!

1870
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:31,450
He's wearing pants!

1871
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:33,090
Look at this cat!

1872
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:35,110
At least I gave my cat pants!

1873
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:35,750
Look at me!

1874
01:34:35,850 --> 01:34:37,410
I am civilized!

1875
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:41,410
I am a civilized cat owner!

1876
01:34:41,870 --> 01:34:42,830
Look at this cat!

1877
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:45,950
Whoever owns this cat doesn't even wear pants!

1878
01:34:46,130 --> 01:34:46,830
Look at him!

1879
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:49,990
Look at him!

1880
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:51,070
He's happy here!

1881
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:52,230
He's happy!

1882
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:57,190
No, he's not!

1883
01:34:57,530 --> 01:34:59,170
Do you love me, Garfield?

1884
01:35:00,050 --> 01:35:00,770
That's right!

1885
01:35:00,790 --> 01:35:01,990
You love me, don't you?

1886
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:03,790
That's right, Garfield!

1887
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:04,970
Follow me!

1888
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:07,310
Out of your own free will and nothing else!

1889
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:10,650
Out of your free will that you will follow me!

1890
01:35:10,650 --> 01:35:12,950
Welcome back, Hunter!

1891
01:35:13,190 --> 01:35:14,210
Looking good out there!

1892
01:35:15,870 --> 01:35:18,250
Thanks for looking after Nata and the other kid.

1893
01:35:18,610 --> 01:35:20,050
Oh, I'm sure about that.

1894
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:22,510
What can I say?

1895
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:23,570
I come in handy.

1896
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:26,790
Hello!

1897
01:35:27,550 --> 01:35:28,910
Everything's set and ready to go.

1898
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:39,970
It's not ideal, but I can make do.

1899
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:43,290
Wearing three layers in the desert.

1900
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:48,210
What?

1901
01:35:50,310 --> 01:35:51,910
Oh, she makes me the weapons.

1902
01:35:58,150 --> 01:36:02,470
She turned off speech so they don't talk back?

1903
01:36:02,670 --> 01:36:04,650
That is not true!

1904
01:36:04,650 --> 01:36:09,310
I turned off speech because it's wrong that they could talk.

1905
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:11,990
And that is not a bad thing!

1906
01:36:12,650 --> 01:36:12,970
Okay?

1907
01:36:13,210 --> 01:36:14,990
It's just not right!

1908
01:36:19,470 --> 01:36:24,490
A hunter's armor is made of five parts.

1909
01:36:25,370 --> 01:36:28,710
Each armor piece has two versions.

1910
01:36:29,230 --> 01:36:31,490
Choose whichever looks best on your hunter.

1911
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:32,810
Will forge later.

1912
01:36:32,970 --> 01:36:33,830
This is wishlist.

1913
01:36:33,970 --> 01:36:36,710
Armor made from chairs with higher defense.

1914
01:36:40,330 --> 01:36:42,270
That doesn't make it!

1915
01:36:43,530 --> 01:36:45,790
You guys are fucking liars!

1916
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:46,970
I know!

1917
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:50,770
Majority of you guys turned off the cat's speech!

1918
01:36:51,210 --> 01:36:52,730
I know you guys turned it off!

1919
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:54,430
I know you guys did!

1920
01:36:54,510 --> 01:36:55,950
Don't fucking lie to me!

1921
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:00,610
Oh, there we go.

1922
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:01,590
What can I make?

1923
01:37:01,730 --> 01:37:02,750
What would I want to make?

1924
01:37:02,810 --> 01:37:04,070
Oh, I like this one.

1925
01:37:04,150 --> 01:37:04,910
That's cute.

1926
01:37:05,810 --> 01:37:07,090
Should I make one?

1927
01:37:12,270 --> 01:37:14,790
You guys are fucking liars if it's on.

1928
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:25,100
Should I buy them or should I buy it now?

1929
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:30,100
Cat callouts are actually useful?

1930
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:32,160
The fuck are they gonna call out?

1931
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:37,980
Okay.

1932
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:39,860
Should I?

1933
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:40,340
Should I?

1934
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:41,100
Should I?

1935
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:42,940
Alright, I'll just grab the helmet.

1936
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,600
I think the helmet's cute.

1937
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:49,300
They are palicos.

1938
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:50,880
Let them talk.

1939
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:57,820
No, I would never want a talking animal because I know they're gonna say some dumb shit.

1940
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:06,960
I know they're gonna, like, if they are allowed to talk, they're just gonna scream at me.

1941
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:10,500
Let's see.

1942
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:12,120
Oh, I actually like this.

1943
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:16,180
I'm gonna buy.

1944
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:17,200
I'm gonna get this.

1945
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:29,840
Nice.

1946
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:31,700
How does she turn a blade into a helmet?

1947
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:32,720
That's a good question.

1948
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:35,780
How does she turn a blade into a fucking jacket?

1949
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:35,960
I like it.

1950
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:41,340
Alright, and then...

1951
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:45,160
Actually, I think I like this one more.

1952
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:51,620
I like this one.

1953
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:53,460
She's just that good.

1954
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:03,400
Oh, I do have free stuff.

1955
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:04,860
Wait, why am I spending money?

1956
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:06,660
Wait, I have free...

1957
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:07,720
Fuck, okay.

1958
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:09,140
That's fine.

1959
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:11,060
Wait, you're right.

1960
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:12,140
I do have free...

1961
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:13,460
I have the DLC!

1962
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:16,280
Okay, um...

1963
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:17,440
Oh, I guess I couldn't.

1964
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:18,240
Wait,

1965
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:32,660
how did I preview?

1966
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:33,580
Oh, gee.

1967
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:36,920
Oh, that's cute!

1968
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:41,830
Is it stronger?

1969
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:43,170
Oh, it is!

1970
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:47,990
It has less thunder resistance.

1971
01:39:48,710 --> 01:39:50,530
I mean, I could give you a stronger melee.

1972
01:39:52,910 --> 01:39:54,910
I'm gonna give you a better weapon, Garfield.

1973
01:39:56,330 --> 01:39:56,730
Yeah.

1974
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:03,600
How do I skip this?

1975
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:06,220
Okay, yeah, I was like, I do not need a...

1976
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:09,380
Wait, let me look at my free shit.

1977
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:10,560
Like, what am I doing?

1978
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:12,920
I have free stuff.

1979
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:14,560
Let me change my pants.

1980
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,060
Wait, none of these are good.

1981
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:22,040
What is these?

1982
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:22,640
Hope Coin.

1983
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:23,180
Oh, wait!

1984
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:25,200
Where's my free stuff?

1985
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:27,000
I thought I had free stuff.

1986
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:29,740
Wait, do I not have free stuff?

1987
01:40:35,950 --> 01:40:38,490
Oh, I have to check your storage box!

1988
01:40:38,650 --> 01:40:39,110
Oh!

1989
01:40:40,370 --> 01:40:40,830
Okay.

1990
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,700
Yeah, I have to check my mail.

1991
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:47,600
Okay, I'll come back.

1992
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:52,440
Oh, is it DLC?

1993
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,160
Okay, they should be in my chest.

1994
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:55,420
Where's the map?

1995
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:57,200
Is this my home?

1996
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:58,360
Look at him!

1997
01:40:58,420 --> 01:40:59,360
He doesn't even wear pants!

1998
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:01,140
I give you pants, Garfield.

1999
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:02,160
Look at this.

2000
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:03,640
Look at this cat.

2001
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:06,220
He doesn't even have pants.

2002
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:07,240
Look at this cat.

2003
01:41:07,820 --> 01:41:08,400
Look at him.

2004
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:09,200
Look at Garfield.

2005
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:12,100
You remember how well I treat you, Garfield.

2006
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:15,820
The owner of this cat doesn't even give him pants.

2007
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:17,520
Remember that.

2008
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:19,880
I treat you so much better.

2009
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:23,820
Okay, my yellow tent is right here.

2010
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:25,820
Wait, where is my tent?

2011
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:28,120
Where is it?

2012
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:32,560
Look at him, Garfield!

2013
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:34,400
Look at him!

2014
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:36,780
You don't even give him... Look at his shirt!

2015
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:40,120
I bet you that shirt was that owner's cat's shirt.

2016
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:42,580
Look at him!

2017
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:44,340
He also doesn't have pants!

2018
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:45,820
Appreciate me!

2019
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:50,740
Where is my house?

2020
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:55,820
Wait, actually, where is my house?

2021
01:41:56,660 --> 01:41:58,080
Where do I live?

2022
01:41:58,620 --> 01:42:02,100
Where do I live?

2023
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:10,120
House of Garfield.

2024
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:13,640
Right next to me?

2025
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:17,400
I'm so confused of my living arrangements.

2026
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:20,080
Wait, he can...

2027
01:42:21,180 --> 01:42:22,200
I lead the support team.

2028
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:23,160
Look forward to working with you.

2029
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:26,840
There should be more of us here, but we're running a bit behind because the others are running late.

2030
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:28,380
I'm a bit worried.

2031
01:42:30,260 --> 01:42:32,020
Where the fuck do I live?

2032
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:35,840
Did I walk past it?

2033
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:38,860
I'm looking at my map and I don't know where it is.

2034
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,780
Like, it says it's here.

2035
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:43,080
But, like, where's the...

2036
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:43,880
Is it this?

2037
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,740
No, that can't be, right?

2038
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:52,620
What is the quest icon?

2039
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:55,060
This?

2040
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:01,360
I don't know the maps in this game.

2041
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:03,780
Tent near the entrance?

2042
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:08,540
This?

2043
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:11,280
Is this the entrance?

2044
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:16,080
Next to the birds?

2045
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:16,800
Oh, here?

2046
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,080
This is my house.

2047
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:19,900
Do I live here?

2048
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:27,030
But, like, where's the storage?

2049
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:27,430
Storage?

2050
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:31,700
Where is it?

2051
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:33,960
Oh, is this tent?

2052
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:36,780
Is this where I live?

2053
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:40,940
I can't even go inside.

2054
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:45,860
It won't even let me go inside.

2055
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:49,000
Oh my god.

2056
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,660
I'm locked out.

2057
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:51,920
I'm gonna have to talk to this guy.

2058
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:08,980
Let me in my house.

2059
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,440
Oh my god, this cat's naked!

2060
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:15,400
Who the fuck let this cat... That's indecent exposure!

2061
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:22,220
He's almost time for a meeting.

2062
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:22,760
A meeting?

2063
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:25,400
Yeah, and?

2064
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:29,720
Who let this naked cat run around?

2065
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:30,620
I don't know.

2066
01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:37,910
Toki is a cat police.

2067
01:44:39,910 --> 01:44:44,010
There is no laws against cat nakedness.

2068
01:44:47,670 --> 01:44:49,510
What unit am I?

2069
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:56,110
Freak.

2070
01:44:57,190 --> 01:44:58,930
All the other cats wear clothes?

2071
01:44:59,130 --> 01:45:00,650
Who let this cat run around naked?

2072
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:04,730
I succeed.

2073
01:45:05,610 --> 01:45:07,970
I just hate it when they can talk.

2074
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:14,890
Let him be free.

2075
01:45:34,050 --> 01:45:35,890
Then we'll need to split up.

2076
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:37,830
Make our search as wide as possible.

2077
01:45:38,830 --> 01:45:39,530
Good deal.

2078
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:43,230
Except I think it'd be better if you held off until the support team arrives.

2079
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:47,550
No objections here.

2080
01:45:49,550 --> 01:45:53,330
This project to survey the forbidden lands has been in the works for years.

2081
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:55,110
And now here we are.

2082
01:45:55,470 --> 01:45:55,970
Finally.

2083
01:45:56,630 --> 01:45:57,270
Thank you all.

2084
01:45:57,510 --> 01:45:59,150
I'm sorry to cause so much trouble.

2085
01:46:00,090 --> 01:46:00,990
It's alright, lad.

2086
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:02,310
We're in this together.

2087
01:46:03,870 --> 01:46:07,830
First things first, I think we ought to escort Nona and Isai back to their village.

2088
01:46:08,250 --> 01:46:09,190
For safety reasons.

2089
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:11,370
That seems wise.

2090
01:46:11,610 --> 01:46:15,150
If we're lucky, someone there might have some information about the keepers.

2091
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:20,130
Why don't we stop by our tent and prepare before we go?

2092
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:24,050
Oh, I can finally go back to my tent.

2093
01:46:24,130 --> 01:46:24,790
Thank God.

2094
01:46:25,910 --> 01:46:30,130
Garfield isn't... Garfield isn't going commando.

2095
01:46:30,130 --> 01:46:31,330
What are you talking about?

2096
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:32,210
This is not Garfield.

2097
01:46:38,310 --> 01:46:40,870
Alright, now I can go home.

2098
01:46:43,810 --> 01:46:45,570
Alright, let's see...

2099
01:46:45,570 --> 01:46:46,210
Get in my tent.

2100
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:47,770
Oh my God, I have a tiny ass tent.

2101
01:46:48,910 --> 01:46:50,650
Alright, you and your pal go need to prepare for hunt.

2102
01:46:50,730 --> 01:46:53,130
Use your tent to change equipment, organize item pouch.

2103
01:46:54,910 --> 01:46:56,930
Okay, so I should be able to have...

2104
01:46:56,930 --> 01:47:03,690
Your trusted never leaves your side, but if you change your deployment sign, they'll go back to their tent and wait there until you're finished.

2105
01:47:04,850 --> 01:47:06,210
Can it go even while on standby?

2106
01:47:06,310 --> 01:47:08,050
Oh, so I can like not bring them.

2107
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,410
But why would I do that?

2108
01:47:14,670 --> 01:47:17,370
Okay, but what if I do make him go naked?

2109
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:23,600
Be free, Garfield.

2110
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:33,760
Doki Beam, you do extra dash and thank you for the super chat.

2111
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:35,280
Thank you, thank you.

2112
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:36,660
What if he just wears a hat?

2113
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:38,760
Alright.

2114
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:42,600
Now we're talking.

2115
01:47:46,220 --> 01:47:46,860
Nice.

2116
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:49,000
Alright.

2117
01:47:50,420 --> 01:47:51,160
Alright.

2118
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:51,380
Alright.

2119
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,380
Be free, Garfield.

2120
01:47:59,660 --> 01:48:01,540
Where's my items in here?

2121
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:06,940
Jesus Christ, I am so overwhelmed looking at all this right now.

2122
01:48:07,820 --> 01:48:09,480
What do I have?

2123
01:48:09,940 --> 01:48:12,260
What are all of these?

2124
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:16,160
What do I...

2125
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:19,200
Wait, what is my...

2126
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,660
What is my...

2127
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:23,780
Okay, let's see.

2128
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:24,400
Train mail.

2129
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:26,000
I thought I had DLC stuff.

2130
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:30,580
From the Kona cat?

2131
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:34,380
Okay, let's see.

2132
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:36,000
The Kona cat should have it.

2133
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:36,340
Okay.

2134
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:45,660
Where you can chat with friends, engage in multiplayer, online connection, you can invite other players.

2135
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:47,480
Alright.

2136
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:53,020
With... see the... with a fixed group of members.

2137
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:56,820
You invite other players, be friends, be the lobby members, or hunt the ID search.

2138
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:57,480
Okay, cool.

2139
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:07,220
You want to change, you can set it, play with hunters, wildlife guys, whether you've joined a lobby or not, change which lobby you're currently in, talk to... and use the changed lobby.

2140
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:07,720
Okay.

2141
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:10,460
Oh, it's this one.

2142
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:11,860
The one cat I talked to.

2143
01:49:12,620 --> 01:49:13,400
Where is that one?

2144
01:49:13,460 --> 01:49:14,260
Oh, this one, right?

2145
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:15,860
And clear my DLC?

2146
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:19,660
Salutation, Sanjay.

2147
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,020
Welcome to the support desk.

2148
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:25,140
We offer items supplied by guild, as well as important news you won't have to miss.

2149
01:49:25,780 --> 01:49:28,720
Tokyo's closed after taking his speech.

2150
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:31,400
That was not my fault.

2151
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:33,920
You guys wanted him naked.

2152
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:38,740
Uhh...

2153
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:39,720
Articress support?

2154
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:40,740
Oh, there you go.

2155
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:41,160
DLC.

2156
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:44,020
Oh, wait.

2157
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:45,260
I should claim it, right?

2158
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:46,500
Since I already have my DLC.

2159
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:48,180
Nice!

2160
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:49,740
Okay, DLC, claim.

2161
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:52,480
Claim.

2162
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:57,060
Okay.

2163
01:49:57,940 --> 01:49:59,820
Mega potion, armor, spirit.

2164
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:01,640
Wait, all of these are...

2165
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:04,670
Wait, but they're all like...

2166
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:06,740
Is that it?

2167
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:07,720
I thought I had more.

2168
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:09,580
Did I not have more?

2169
01:50:15,850 --> 01:50:17,570
Wait, should I...

2170
01:50:17,570 --> 01:50:18,610
That's it?

2171
01:50:18,930 --> 01:50:19,370
Oh!

2172
01:50:20,110 --> 01:50:21,070
I thought I had more.

2173
01:50:23,170 --> 01:50:25,230
Where my beautiful cat?

2174
01:50:30,410 --> 01:50:33,330
Alright, let's get the other armor for him.

2175
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:35,310
Okay, uhh...

2176
01:50:36,070 --> 01:50:37,770
Let's give him the rest.

2177
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:41,350
Yeah!

2178
01:50:42,210 --> 01:50:44,130
He looks ashamed.

2179
01:50:45,990 --> 01:50:46,230
Alright.

2180
01:50:47,370 --> 01:50:49,910
I mean, he looks happy that he's free now.

2181
01:50:51,230 --> 01:50:54,310
Free, not Garfield.

2182
01:50:58,960 --> 01:50:59,540
Hello.

2183
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:04,000
Wait, can I actually get other hunters to help me?

2184
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:12,480
How do I do that?

2185
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:26,540
You're the most popular in the lobby.

2186
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:29,400
A private lobby can only be joined by searching an ideal for those.

2187
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,460
It's recommended for solo players.

2188
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:33,720
This mode lets you pause the game from the start.

2189
01:51:33,860 --> 01:51:34,440
Oh, okay.

2190
01:51:38,180 --> 01:51:39,380
Alright, let's try it.

2191
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,840
How do I... Did I do it?

2192
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:49,720
How do I start my quest?

2193
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:53,560
No?

2194
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:54,880
I'm confused.

2195
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:02,220
Uhh...

2196
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:03,700
Am I in?

2197
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:09,570
Did I do it?

2198
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:11,890
I'm so confused.

2199
01:52:15,970 --> 01:52:17,430
Am I in?

2200
01:52:17,550 --> 01:52:18,970
I don't know.

2201
01:52:19,410 --> 01:52:20,430
Oh, I have login bonus.

2202
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:21,410
Oh,

2203
01:52:30,150 --> 01:52:32,170
I'm in a private lobby by myself?

2204
01:52:32,330 --> 01:52:33,150
Oh shit, okay.

2205
01:52:34,170 --> 01:52:37,150
I wanna see other dragoons' cats.

2206
01:52:39,790 --> 01:52:42,630
Kyle, can I please have a game code?

2207
01:52:43,010 --> 01:52:45,050
You'll be my number one.

2208
01:52:45,250 --> 01:52:45,990
Who's number one?

2209
01:52:46,090 --> 01:52:47,770
Have they ever given you a game code?

2210
01:52:48,350 --> 01:52:49,710
Thank you for the super chat, Kyle.

2211
01:52:49,830 --> 01:52:50,890
Thank you, thank you.

2212
01:52:51,150 --> 01:52:51,430
Okay.

2213
01:52:52,550 --> 01:52:53,050
Alright.

2214
01:52:54,630 --> 01:52:56,150
How do I find my...

2215
01:52:56,630 --> 01:52:58,030
How do I... Okay.

2216
01:53:01,590 --> 01:53:02,670
Lobby ID search?

2217
01:53:02,710 --> 01:53:03,210
How the fuck...

2218
01:53:04,830 --> 01:53:07,210
How do I know what my lobby ID is?

2219
01:53:09,010 --> 01:53:09,950
Does it tell me?

2220
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:13,870
I don't even know what my lobby ID is.

2221
01:53:19,820 --> 01:53:20,960
The support desk?

2222
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:21,700
Is it this one?

2223
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:27,140
Oh, I have to make a lobby first.

2224
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:28,900
Who are you Felicita?

2225
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:34,820
Oh, okay.

2226
01:53:37,740 --> 01:53:40,480
Yeah, sure.

2227
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:54,140
Kyle, thank you for the super chat.

2228
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:55,480
Thank you, thank you.

2229
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:16,260
Jesus Christ.

2230
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:17,600
Okay, I'll figure this out.

2231
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:21,940
Okay.

2232
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:37,000
Fuck.

2233
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:43,740
Don't be bad.

2234
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:46,300
There you go.

2235
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:51,870
Wait, your cats have to be...

2236
01:54:57,630 --> 01:54:59,220
Okay, okay.

2237
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:02,840
Okay, okay.

2238
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:07,500
Your cats... Sorry, cat.

2239
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:13,180
There we go.

2240
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:14,280
There we go.

2241
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:15,280
Emblem icon.

2242
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:16,520
Okay, we need a Palico.

2243
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:19,720
Let's see.

2244
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:24,320
Okay, is there an orange?

2245
01:55:24,540 --> 01:55:25,320
We need an orange.

2246
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:26,960
I guess this is orange.

2247
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:27,820
Is this orange?

2248
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:29,420
Yeah, that's like Garfield.

2249
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:31,440
Okay, emblem shape.

2250
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:34,460
Okay, that's wrong.

2251
01:55:41,020 --> 01:55:42,520
Okay, there you go.

2252
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:49,000

2253
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:49,760
Okay.

2254
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:53,240
Hashtag.

2255
01:55:56,460 --> 01:56:00,220
Wait, what should I add?

2256
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:04,160
Dragoon.

2257
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:06,080

2258
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:11,540

Do I change that?

2269
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:35,420
Yeah.

2270
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:42,840

No talking cats.

2276
01:56:59,260 --> 01:57:00,240
Oh, you're right, you're right.

2277
01:57:00,820 --> 01:57:01,720
Your cat chat.

2278
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:06,520

Nice.

2282
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:17,600
It's just me.

2283
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:20,340
This is like my, me and my one.

2284
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:22,500
Wait, there's already 15 people in my squad?

2285
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:24,940
Who the fuck is in my squad already?

2286
01:57:24,940 --> 01:57:26,200
Who are they?

2287
01:57:26,660 --> 01:57:31,920
There's already, there's already 15 people in, how is this, oh my god.

2288
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:35,790
Holy fuck.

01:57:36,210 --> 01:57:37,490
Okay, okay.

2290
01:57:39,330 --> 01:57:40,830
Damn, alright.

2291
01:57:41,930 --> 01:57:42,670
Nice.

2292
01:57:43,590 --> 01:57:44,670
Got my squad.

2293
01:57:47,330 --> 01:57:50,010
Okay, I gotta figure this out, guys.

2294
01:57:50,590 --> 01:57:52,390
Level 99.

2295
01:57:53,370 --> 01:57:55,730
Who's the, you're right, I'm gonna invite them.

2296
01:57:56,010 --> 01:57:58,410
I'm gonna invite the level 99 onto my team.

2297
01:57:59,490 --> 01:58:01,390
Let's get, let's get him in here.

2298
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:06,110
How do I get him in here?

2299
01:58:07,250 --> 01:58:08,290
Madness squad.

2300
01:58:09,270 --> 01:58:10,270
There's 33?

2301
01:58:10,630 --> 01:58:11,630
Jesus Christ.

2302
01:58:12,010 --> 01:58:14,230
Every, see guys, these people.

2303
01:58:15,110 --> 01:58:19,010
Alright, view, view a pundit's profile.

2304
01:58:20,050 --> 01:58:20,750
Who is he?

2305
01:58:20,750 --> 01:58:22,190
What the fuck?

2306
01:58:22,790 --> 01:58:24,010
The fuck is that?

2307
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:26,330
The unknown hero?

2308
01:58:26,530 --> 01:58:27,510
Who are you?

2309
01:58:28,270 --> 01:58:30,050
Who the fuck are you?

2310
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:31,130
What?

2311
01:58:31,770 --> 01:58:33,730
Oh my god.

2312
01:58:33,950 --> 01:58:35,990
He's, bro, what's wrong with this cat?

2313
01:58:36,530 --> 01:58:37,870
Why is he wearing clothes?

2314
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:48,640
Guys, I thought we said, I thought we agreed that your cats can't wear clothes.

2315
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:50,920
Why is he wearing clothes right now?

2316
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:53,180
Dude is on the grind.

2317
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:55,040
That's a tab.

2318
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:57,920
Cat has clothes, we gotta kick him.

2319
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:01,400
Bro, how the fuck does, how, what the fuck?

2320
01:59:01,940 --> 01:59:02,900
What does he have?

2321
01:59:04,020 --> 01:59:06,580
Rarity 8, Rarity 8, Rarity.

2322
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:08,420
The game just came out.

2323
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:16,280
Oh my god, explain yourself.

2324
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:18,320
Explain, what are these?

2325
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:20,460
Level 52.

2326
01:59:21,460 --> 01:59:23,780
That's an endgame.

2327
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:27,380
He's already in endgame territory.

2328
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:30,400
What the feline gore ghost, eh?

2329
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:32,760
The fuck does that even mean?

2330
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:39,040
That's his paralysis demon.

2331
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:42,440
Bro, you killed two things.

2332
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:45,860
Wait.

2333
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:49,580
Hunted 13?

2334
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:52,600
He's hunted, excuse me?

2335
01:59:52,700 --> 01:59:54,460
He's hunted 10 of these?

2336
01:59:58,220 --> 02:00:00,160
Oh my god.

2337
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:02,140
Bro, what do you mean?

2338
02:00:02,840 --> 02:00:06,400
What do you mean, give Rarity hunted 5 of them?

2339
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:09,760
Oh my god.

2340
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:11,220
That guy's freaking insane.

2341
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:12,960
Bro, what the fuck?

2342
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:18,820
Um, I actually reviewed, oh my god, you reviewed the, get in here.

2343
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:21,940
Oh my god, he's a game reviewer.

2344
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:24,580
How do I invite him to my squad?

2345
02:00:27,580 --> 02:00:32,480
Bro, I like how we all agree that we don't want, we don't want cats to wear clothes.

2346
02:00:32,660 --> 02:00:33,800
I'm glad we all agree.

2347
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:37,300
I'm, I'm glad we all agree.

2348
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:39,520
Wait, how do I?

2349
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:45,080
Make your cat naked, right?

2350
02:00:51,080 --> 02:00:53,240
Strip, strip, free the cat.

2351
02:00:56,530 --> 02:00:58,070
Join the squad's lobby?

2352
02:00:58,210 --> 02:00:59,210
How do I do that?

2353
02:01:01,030 --> 02:01:02,510
Check squad, wait, how do I?

2354
02:01:06,990 --> 02:01:08,050
It's like a guild?

2355
02:01:08,250 --> 02:01:09,510
Oh, it's like a guild?

2356
02:01:10,450 --> 02:01:12,270
Okay, okay, I made my guild.

2357
02:01:12,270 --> 02:01:14,550
This is my dragoon guild.

2358
02:01:14,810 --> 02:01:15,830
Right there.

2359
02:01:16,210 --> 02:01:18,090
I made my dragoon guild.

2360
02:01:18,490 --> 02:01:20,170
Now I gotta figure out how to make a lobby.

2361
02:01:23,530 --> 02:01:24,170
Alright.

2362
02:01:24,890 --> 02:01:26,330
That's like level 99.

2363
02:01:26,790 --> 02:01:28,150
The fuck, what happened?

2364
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:31,670
Alright.

2365
02:01:32,150 --> 02:01:33,230
Open, is it this?

2366
02:01:35,090 --> 02:01:36,250
Lobby search.

2367
02:01:38,110 --> 02:01:40,090
Conditional 100 friends squished.

2368
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:41,830
Oh, squad lobby search.

2369
02:01:42,730 --> 02:01:44,170
There you go.

2370
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:47,050
Oh, let's all join.

2371
02:01:47,390 --> 02:01:48,630
I'm joining the lobby.

2372
02:01:51,090 --> 02:01:51,970
This is it.

2373
02:01:52,870 --> 02:01:54,050
I'm in it now.

2374
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:57,170
Alright, where's your cat?

2375
02:01:57,610 --> 02:01:58,970
Show me your, where's my cat?

2376
02:01:59,470 --> 02:02:00,230
Where's your cat?

2377
02:02:01,230 --> 02:02:02,270
Where is it?

2378
02:02:03,970 --> 02:02:04,910
Where are your cats?

2379
02:02:04,910 --> 02:02:07,390
Your cat's wearing clothes, I see him.

2380
02:02:08,450 --> 02:02:09,810
Virgil's wearing clothes.

2381
02:02:14,690 --> 02:02:17,950
Why is your cat wearing, that's right little Jimmy.

2382
02:02:18,450 --> 02:02:21,330
There we go, this guy knows the assignment.

2383
02:02:21,870 --> 02:02:23,270
Why is little Jimmy just sitting there?

2384
02:02:23,310 --> 02:02:23,810
Is he okay?

2385
02:02:24,650 --> 02:02:24,950
Is he?

2386
02:02:30,030 --> 02:02:31,890
Is little Jimmy okay?

2387
02:02:32,630 --> 02:02:33,770
He's just sitting there.

2388
02:02:35,230 --> 02:02:37,970
Bad toast for having clothes on.

2389
02:02:38,410 --> 02:02:39,550
Whose cat is this?

2390
02:02:40,290 --> 02:02:41,830
Whose cat is this?

2391
02:02:42,290 --> 02:02:43,290
We gotta...

2392
02:02:44,850 --> 02:02:46,750
Whose cat is this?

2393
02:02:47,130 --> 02:02:49,690
I need to know so I can kick them from the squad.

2394
02:02:50,010 --> 02:02:51,430
I need to know.

2395
02:02:55,110 --> 02:02:57,790
That's right, alright, there we go.

2396
02:02:58,290 --> 02:02:59,950
The silly little guy.

2397
02:03:00,470 --> 02:03:01,570
Little Jimmy.

2398
02:03:01,570 --> 02:03:05,350
Jimmy's just mad he has to be naked.

2399
02:03:07,410 --> 02:03:10,270
Where's the level 99 dev?

2400
02:03:10,730 --> 02:03:12,870
Level 99 game reviewer.

2401
02:03:12,910 --> 02:03:15,110
I need him in the squad right now.

2402
02:03:16,090 --> 02:03:19,210
I need the whatever the ghost cat is.

2403
02:03:19,570 --> 02:03:21,670
I need ghost cat right now.

2404
02:03:27,270 --> 02:03:27,630
No!

2405
02:03:31,570 --> 02:03:32,690
That's right.

2406
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:37,330
Only cats with no clothes can join this squad.

2407
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:41,470
Oh my god, look at this fucking tank.

2408
02:03:41,690 --> 02:03:43,130
He knows what he's got.

2409
02:03:43,570 --> 02:03:45,070
Look at Coco Bean.

2410
02:03:45,590 --> 02:03:50,130
Oh my god, Coco Bean is out there shredding.

2411
02:03:50,850 --> 02:03:53,290
How is this game dokey?

2412
02:03:53,750 --> 02:03:56,570
I did one mission and I've been stuck here.

2413
02:03:59,250 --> 02:04:01,090
He's a chuck.

2414
02:04:01,090 --> 02:04:04,070
Oh my god, look at all these cats.

2415
02:04:06,850 --> 02:04:09,030
Alright, nice, okay.

2416
02:04:09,530 --> 02:04:12,810
Now I gotta figure out how to create a... I'm still trying to figure out how to create a lobby, guys.

2417
02:04:16,390 --> 02:04:19,510
I'm still trying to figure out how to create a lobby.

2418
02:04:20,050 --> 02:04:22,970
Alright, I'm gonna figure this out.

2419
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:26,830
We've been stuck... I'm still in the tutorial.

2420
02:04:28,130 --> 02:04:29,250
Okay, open.

2421
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:31,230
Join quest.

2422
02:04:31,390 --> 02:04:31,950
Oh, okay.

2423
02:04:32,150 --> 02:04:33,570
You can access the quest counter.

2424
02:04:37,670 --> 02:04:38,970
What do I do?

2425
02:04:39,070 --> 02:04:42,790
Optional quest, assignments, event quest, lobby member quest.

2426
02:04:43,470 --> 02:04:44,010
Do I need lobby?

2427
02:04:44,230 --> 02:04:45,170
Okay, what do I do?

2428
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:46,270
Wait, what is the settings?

2429
02:04:46,910 --> 02:04:48,730
Okay, it's four players.

2430
02:04:49,830 --> 02:04:54,130
Oh, that's the lobby?

2431
02:04:54,570 --> 02:04:55,310
Okay, assignment.

2432
02:04:55,310 --> 02:04:56,850
Oh, we already did that.

2433
02:04:57,230 --> 02:04:58,550
Is it optional quest?

2434
02:05:01,270 --> 02:05:02,070
Stage 12.

2435
02:05:02,290 --> 02:05:03,770
Is there any other quests here?

2436
02:05:07,990 --> 02:05:09,670
I mean, we already did this, though.

2437
02:05:11,250 --> 02:05:13,030
Oh, I have to do a story.

2438
02:05:13,510 --> 02:05:13,850
Oh.

2439
02:05:16,450 --> 02:05:16,850
Okay.

2440
02:05:17,890 --> 02:05:18,670
Just do the story?

2441
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:20,410
Alright, guys, I'll be back, everybody.

2442
02:05:20,550 --> 02:05:21,930
I just gotta do the story now.

2443
02:05:23,110 --> 02:05:24,170
I gotta do the story.

2444
02:05:24,270 --> 02:05:26,150
Wait, you can customize your messages?

2445
02:05:26,150 --> 02:05:27,570
I didn't know that.

2446
02:05:27,790 --> 02:05:28,810
That's so cool.

2447
02:05:28,910 --> 02:05:31,010
How many people can I have in my guild, anyway?

2448
02:05:31,510 --> 02:05:32,810
How many people join my guild?

2449
02:05:33,570 --> 02:05:34,910
Wait, wait.

2450
02:05:35,170 --> 02:05:36,030
Wait a minute.

2451
02:05:40,010 --> 02:05:42,630
Wait a minute, I don't look at my chat.

2452
02:05:43,190 --> 02:05:43,510
Wait.

2453
02:05:44,730 --> 02:05:45,030
Wait.

2454
02:05:49,370 --> 02:05:52,110
Why is your chat very close?

2455
02:05:56,150 --> 02:05:57,870
Oh my god, that's so good.

2456
02:05:58,370 --> 02:05:59,690
That's so good.

2457
02:06:00,030 --> 02:06:00,950
That's crazy.

2458
02:06:01,450 --> 02:06:03,590
That's such a crazy message.

2459
02:06:04,070 --> 02:06:06,470
Oh my god, that's crazy.

2460
02:06:06,570 --> 02:06:07,510
I love that.

2461
02:06:07,930 --> 02:06:11,850
I can't believe they let you do this.

2462
02:06:12,810 --> 02:06:14,070
Oh my god.

2463
02:06:14,650 --> 02:06:16,030
Oh, that's so good.

2464
02:06:16,230 --> 02:06:17,770
That's so good.

2465
02:06:18,010 --> 02:06:19,110
Holy fuck.

2466
02:06:19,670 --> 02:06:21,550
Wait, can we have 50 squads?

2467
02:06:22,050 --> 02:06:23,610
50 members in my squad?

2468
02:06:23,610 --> 02:06:24,870
Wait, really?

2469
02:06:26,510 --> 02:06:29,210
I can only have 50 members in my squad?

2470
02:06:29,350 --> 02:06:30,090
That's crazy.

2471
02:06:32,270 --> 02:06:34,770
Yeah, but I have a level 99 though.

2472
02:06:36,270 --> 02:06:37,390
Absolutely phenomenal.

2473
02:06:37,650 --> 02:06:38,990
That's such a good sticker.

2474
02:06:39,370 --> 02:06:41,650
Why is your chat way close?

2475
02:06:43,870 --> 02:06:45,870
Holy fuck, that's so good.

2476
02:06:48,750 --> 02:06:51,790
Oh, I can make more squads?

2477
02:06:51,790 --> 02:06:52,810
Okay, nice.

2478
02:06:52,990 --> 02:06:53,510
Let's head out.

2479
02:06:53,590 --> 02:06:54,730
I'll make another squad later.

2480
02:06:55,150 --> 02:06:57,250
This game is the future.

2481
02:07:01,530 --> 02:07:02,110
Alright,

2482
02:07:05,550 --> 02:07:07,790
after I do this next story...

2483
02:07:21,790 --> 02:07:23,450
Game of the year.

2484
02:07:23,970 --> 02:07:26,230
I'm so angry, John!

2485
02:07:35,430 --> 02:07:38,570
Goodbye everybody, I'm doing my mission now.

2486
02:07:39,490 --> 02:07:40,090
Goodbye.

2487
02:07:50,770 --> 02:07:52,730
Oh, that's so handy.

2488
02:07:53,090 --> 02:07:53,870
If I just do this.

2489
02:07:55,350 --> 02:07:55,790
Nice.

2490
02:07:58,930 --> 02:08:01,050
Oh, shoot the flare when the hunt starts?

2491
02:08:01,190 --> 02:08:01,430
Okay.

2492
02:08:03,890 --> 02:08:05,810
Oh, this is so convenient.

2493
02:08:06,130 --> 02:08:08,090
Is this new or has this always been in the game?

2494
02:08:11,190 --> 02:08:12,470
Oh, that's right.

2495
02:08:12,530 --> 02:08:14,210
I'm fucking catching the fireflies.

2496
02:08:14,630 --> 02:08:16,910
The fireflies are being endangered.

2497
02:08:17,290 --> 02:08:18,470
It's because of me.

2498
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:21,630
Catching all of the fireflies.

2499
02:08:22,990 --> 02:08:24,170
Oh, that's new?

2500
02:08:24,310 --> 02:08:26,010
Yeah, this is so convenient, actually.

2501
02:08:26,790 --> 02:08:27,470
I love it.

2502
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:33,840
I like how convenient that is.

2503
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:37,600
Like, I don't have to actually walk up there.

2504
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:39,240
The wiggly leechy.

2505
02:08:42,500 --> 02:08:43,940
I'm gonna kill that thing.

2506
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:46,860
What is that?

2507
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:49,140
Yeah, what is that?

2508
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:51,000
Let's get closer.

2509
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:51,960
Okay, Garfield.

2510
02:08:56,820 --> 02:08:58,300
It's definitely a nice feature.

2511
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:00,120
What if I...

2512
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:01,740
What if I...

2513
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:05,740
What if I...

2514
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:10,840
What if I...

2515
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:14,200
What if I just, you know...

2516
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:15,400
What if I...

2517
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:16,720
Oh, I'm so tempted.

2518
02:09:22,290 --> 02:09:24,870
Alright, I just wanna...

2519
02:09:24,870 --> 02:09:25,950
I just wanna...

2520
02:09:25,950 --> 02:09:27,470
I just wanna kill it.

2521
02:09:31,650 --> 02:09:33,170
What if I...

2522
02:09:36,140 --> 02:09:37,820
What if I just poke them?

2523
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:43,360
Can I not?

2524
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:53,120
They're not aggressive.

2525
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:56,060
See, look at them.

2526
02:09:56,100 --> 02:09:56,700
They're okay.

2527
02:09:57,120 --> 02:09:58,240
Wait a minute, what are you gonna do?

2528
02:09:59,420 --> 02:10:00,760
See, they're okay.

2529
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:02,500
They're not gonna do anything.

2530
02:10:02,820 --> 02:10:03,500
Look at them.

2531
02:10:04,140 --> 02:10:05,440
Fucking cowards.

2532
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:07,960
There I go.

2533
02:10:08,220 --> 02:10:09,120
Where's the other one?

2534
02:10:10,540 --> 02:10:11,340
Where's the other one?

2535
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:12,480
Where's the other one I'm supposed to observe?

2536
02:10:14,720 --> 02:10:15,600
Get them.

2537
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:17,440
These?

2538
02:10:20,160 --> 02:10:21,480
Am I supposed to observe?

2539
02:10:26,050 --> 02:10:26,930
Hello, guys.

2540
02:10:32,060 --> 02:10:33,400
See, look, they're okay.

2541
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:36,160
I still have, like, something to observe.

2542
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:38,200
But, like, I don't know what I'm supposed to.

2543
02:10:43,970 --> 02:10:44,910
Where are they?

2544
02:10:44,910 --> 02:10:44,990
Where are they?

2545
02:10:47,110 --> 02:10:48,910
What if I just...

2546
02:10:56,260 --> 02:10:57,280
Nah, I'm evil.

2547
02:11:00,260 --> 02:11:01,280
See, they're okay.

2548
02:11:01,420 --> 02:11:01,960
Look at them.

2549
02:11:02,080 --> 02:11:02,440
Goodbye.

2550
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:12,860
There's, like, one more thing to observe, but where?

2551
02:11:17,810 --> 02:11:19,510
Oh, man, what a weird shape.

2552
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:32,800
Huh.

2553
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:34,120
Grab the stone, though.

2554
02:11:40,140 --> 02:11:41,660
What could I be observing?

2555
02:11:43,360 --> 02:11:44,160
Oh, well.

2556
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:47,440
We're seeing nature.

2557
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:49,820
Okay, but you guys know crows are pieces of shit?

2558
02:11:50,140 --> 02:11:51,900
That they actually do that in real life?

2559
02:11:52,440 --> 02:11:56,220
All they do is just annoy other animals and cause shit to happen?

2560
02:11:56,820 --> 02:11:57,560
Have you seen that video?

2561
02:11:57,720 --> 02:12:00,620
Like, there's a crow that starts a fight between, like, two dogs?

2562
02:12:01,820 --> 02:12:02,740
Want that honey?

2563
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:12,120
I didn't find, like, the the optional quest.

2564
02:12:16,550 --> 02:12:18,070
There you go.

2565
02:12:18,350 --> 02:12:19,090
I got it.

2566
02:12:23,580 --> 02:12:24,660
Where do I follow?

2567
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:26,400
Oh, this way.

2568
02:12:29,480 --> 02:12:33,320
Yeah, there's a video of, like, crows starting fights with other dogs.

2569
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:38,160
Draw water?

2570
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:45,740
Okay.

2571
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:47,880
I want this.

2572
02:12:49,580 --> 02:12:50,240
Poke.

2573
02:12:53,420 --> 02:12:54,800
I want this, too.

2574
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:56,440
I want all of this.

2575
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:01,820
I want that wiggly litchy.

2576
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:04,520
And I want this.

2577
02:13:06,180 --> 02:13:06,940
And I want this.

2578
02:13:07,780 --> 02:13:09,120
No, give it to me!

2579
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:11,280
Yoink.

2580
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:14,340
I'm just looting everything.

2581
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:15,340
I want this, too.

2582
02:13:16,220 --> 02:13:17,220
And I want that honey.

2583
02:13:18,980 --> 02:13:21,180
I love the scattering tool.

2584
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,160
It's literally a drive-by.

2585
02:13:23,380 --> 02:13:24,060
Give me that bug.

2586
02:13:26,280 --> 02:13:27,200
Wait, person.

2587
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:29,680
Can I loot him?

2588
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:34,480
Hello.

2589
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:34,540
Hello.

2590
02:13:44,260 --> 02:13:44,740
Hello?

2591
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:46,260
Do I have to walk closer?

2592
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:47,840
Oh, okay.

2593
02:13:51,160 --> 02:14:05,200
I did it.

2594
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:05,640
That's me.

2595
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:22,820
Okay.

2596
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:28,600
What?

2597
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:35,980
Pastor, try to find another route?

2598
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:39,220
Why can't I come in?

2599
02:14:39,340 --> 02:14:39,920
Why not?

2600
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:41,980
I'm just like them.

2601
02:14:42,120 --> 02:14:44,160
Is it because my cat's not wearing clothes?

2602
02:14:44,540 --> 02:14:45,680
Is that why?

2603
02:14:47,220 --> 02:14:47,780
Is that why?

2604
02:14:47,940 --> 02:14:50,460
Are you fucking oppressing my cat?

2605
02:14:51,620 --> 02:14:52,900
They said...

2606
02:14:52,900 --> 02:14:55,420
I think it's because my cat doesn't wear clothes.

2607
02:14:55,540 --> 02:14:57,260
I think they're jealous of my cat.

2608
02:15:00,620 --> 02:15:02,320
I can't believe it.

2609
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:03,880
You're right, Garfield.

2610
02:15:06,120 --> 02:15:07,380
You're so right.

2611
02:15:07,380 --> 02:15:09,060
They're not carrying weapons.

2612
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:10,480
You know what that means.

2613
02:15:12,260 --> 02:15:13,980
They're so vulnerable.

2614
02:15:14,420 --> 02:15:16,240
You're so right, Garfield.

2615
02:15:16,660 --> 02:15:18,860
They're so vulnerable right now.

2616
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:26,850
Oh my god.

2617
02:15:26,870 --> 02:15:29,310
I can grab stuff from so far away.

2618
02:15:29,450 --> 02:15:30,130
That's crazy.

2619
02:15:37,380 --> 02:15:38,560
Oh shit!

2620
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:42,120
Not the Felaci!

2621
02:15:42,120 --> 02:15:42,760
Felaci?

2622
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:44,500
Don't worry.

2623
02:15:46,380 --> 02:15:47,920
I'm gonna kill them too.

2624
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:51,300
Don't worry.

2625
02:15:53,060 --> 02:15:54,520
Don't worry, I got them.

2626
02:15:54,820 --> 02:15:56,280
Don't worry, I'm helping you out.

2627
02:15:59,280 --> 02:15:59,880
Whoops.

2628
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:04,980
Don't worry, guys.

2629
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:14,700
Don't worry, I got you.

2630
02:16:14,700 --> 02:16:16,720
What the hell?

2631
02:16:17,080 --> 02:16:18,000
We're on death.

2632
02:16:18,380 --> 02:16:20,320
The collateral damage.

2633
02:16:20,780 --> 02:16:22,060
That's gonna happen anyway.

2634
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:24,160
More loot for me, not gonna lie.

2635
02:16:24,520 --> 02:16:26,280
You're killing the victim.

2636
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:29,460
More loot for me.

2637
02:16:30,180 --> 02:16:30,680
Nice.

2638
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,180
It's not my fault they stood near me.

2639
02:16:38,450 --> 02:16:39,260
More loot!

2640
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:40,980
Guys, more loot!

2641
02:16:43,020 --> 02:16:43,820
More loot!

2642
02:16:44,060 --> 02:16:44,140
More loot, guys!

2643
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:47,220
Oh my god.

2644
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:48,640
More loot for me.

2645
02:16:50,900 --> 02:16:53,580
Yeah, I need them for- You missed them.

2646
02:16:53,740 --> 02:16:54,380
Did I?

2647
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:57,960
Did I really miss?

2648
02:17:05,470 --> 02:17:06,730
I was helping out.

2649
02:17:11,870 --> 02:17:15,310
Yeah, but I have to pay with money.

2650
02:17:15,410 --> 02:17:17,430
Why pay when they're all just walking around?

2651
02:17:18,810 --> 02:17:19,370
Let's move.

2652
02:17:20,890 --> 02:17:21,670
Wait, no, wait.

2653
02:17:21,750 --> 02:17:25,810
I can't- I didn't fucking kill them for fun.

2654
02:17:26,770 --> 02:17:27,850
Wait, they all disappeared.

2655
02:17:29,170 --> 02:17:31,250
What the- Where are my kills?

2656
02:17:32,010 --> 02:17:35,610
What was the- No!

2657
02:17:36,370 --> 02:17:38,050
They all just disappeared!

2658
02:17:40,170 --> 02:17:40,730
No!

2659
02:17:41,270 --> 02:17:43,810
I'm armed!

2660
02:17:46,250 --> 02:17:47,250
Oh my god.

2661
02:17:47,250 --> 02:17:49,210
My population- Oh, there we go.

2662
02:17:49,790 --> 02:17:51,230
Nice, at least he stayed.

2663
02:17:51,550 --> 02:17:53,070
Oh shit, no, they all stayed.

2664
02:17:53,150 --> 02:17:53,910
No, they're all here.

2665
02:17:54,130 --> 02:17:55,010
Oh, I moved.

2666
02:17:55,990 --> 02:17:56,830
That's why.

2667
02:17:56,930 --> 02:17:57,890
I like moved.

2668
02:17:58,390 --> 02:18:01,910
Okay, I don't need the bugs.

2669
02:18:02,030 --> 02:18:02,970
I need these guys.

2670
02:18:03,750 --> 02:18:04,810
There we go, the female.

2671
02:18:06,210 --> 02:18:07,110
Look at that, see?

2672
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:13,020
I get one herbivore shell.

2673
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:14,820
Look at that.

2674
02:18:16,460 --> 02:18:16,980
Planned.

2675
02:18:19,880 --> 02:18:21,560
Let's just grab these guys.

2676
02:18:24,420 --> 02:18:25,700
Yeah, too much loot.

2677
02:18:25,780 --> 02:18:26,300
Exactly.

2678
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:29,080
Guys, it wasn't the wrong target.

2679
02:18:29,600 --> 02:18:31,540
They were all the right targets, guys.

2680
02:18:33,460 --> 02:18:35,800
I don't like that they're still twitching.

2681
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:39,740
Are these the arachnophobia monsters?

2682
02:18:40,960 --> 02:18:47,280
What would they look like if I, like, changed the- That's right, there's never a wrong target.

2683
02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:48,520
Nice.

2684
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:49,600
I got raw meat.

2685
02:18:50,220 --> 02:18:51,380
You carve it more than once?

2686
02:18:51,480 --> 02:18:52,460
No, it's just once.

2687
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:56,780
Oh, they get turned into slimes?

2688
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,080
What do you mean wrong target?

2689
02:18:58,220 --> 02:19:00,540
There's literally- Oh, these are just flashfires, nevermind.

2690
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:07,200
The big slime?

2691
02:19:07,420 --> 02:19:08,140
Oh, that's cool.

2692
02:19:10,880 --> 02:19:11,720
I want this.

2693
02:19:21,970 --> 02:19:23,450
Yeah, some kind of- You know what?

2694
02:19:23,490 --> 02:19:25,850
I want to know what you'd sound like when you start talking.

2695
02:19:27,270 --> 02:19:28,070
Okay, options.

2696
02:19:29,210 --> 02:19:30,650
How do I give you a voice?

2697
02:19:40,110 --> 02:19:40,510
Wait.

2698
02:19:43,170 --> 02:19:44,670
How do I give him a voice?

2699
02:19:46,930 --> 02:19:47,850
Can I do it here?

2700
02:19:53,400 --> 02:19:54,240
Talk to me.

2701
02:19:58,740 --> 02:20:00,020
Talk to me, little guy.

2702
02:20:02,480 --> 02:20:03,560
Talk to me.

2703
02:20:08,990 --> 02:20:12,190
What do you sound like if I- Wait, what?

2704
02:20:16,180 --> 02:20:17,240
Oops, sorry.

2705
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:27,030
Don't bully your cat.

2706
02:20:27,330 --> 02:20:29,330
I just want to know what he sounds like.

2707
02:20:33,690 --> 02:20:34,590
He's fine.

2708
02:20:35,050 --> 02:20:36,250
We're just playing around.

2709
02:20:36,490 --> 02:20:37,190
Right, Garfield?

2710
02:20:41,720 --> 02:20:43,340
We're just playing around.

2711
02:20:43,340 --> 02:20:43,380
Yeah.

2712
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:46,540
Oh my god.

2713
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:48,360
Why do you sound like Deku?

2714
02:20:52,100 --> 02:20:57,180
He just sounds like- He sounds like the English dub of Deku.

2715
02:21:10,310 --> 02:21:11,530
Oh, we got it.

2716
02:21:14,810 --> 02:21:16,050
Oh my god.

2717
02:21:29,170 --> 02:21:30,850
This is so wrong.

2718
02:21:31,930 --> 02:21:33,670
You don't deserve rights anymore.

2719
02:21:37,070 --> 02:21:39,450
You are not allowed to talk.

2720
02:21:39,790 --> 02:21:42,230
You are not allowed to talk.

2721
02:21:42,730 --> 02:21:43,930
Turn it off.

2722
02:21:50,010 --> 02:21:51,410
Talk to Jack?

2723
02:21:51,490 --> 02:21:52,270
Is that Jack?

2724
02:21:52,530 --> 02:21:52,650
Is that Jack?

2725
02:21:52,650 --> 02:21:53,730
Hey there.

2726
02:21:54,050 --> 02:21:55,070
What can I do for you?

2727
02:21:56,310 --> 02:21:58,250
It's not what God intended.

2728
02:21:59,690 --> 02:22:00,250
Disgusting.

2729
02:22:01,270 --> 02:22:02,290
Sweet deal.

2730
02:22:04,390 --> 02:22:07,350
Honey is the sticky secret to our healing potions.

2731
02:22:07,990 --> 02:22:09,570
You're literally a lifesaver.

2732
02:22:10,250 --> 02:22:11,150
This is for your trouble.

2733
02:22:12,970 --> 02:22:14,810
I receive the following as thank you.

2734
02:22:14,890 --> 02:22:16,150
Oh, I got a BBQ grill.

2735
02:22:16,450 --> 02:22:17,210
Fishing rod.

2736
02:22:17,530 --> 02:22:18,090
Binoculars.

2737
02:22:18,090 --> 02:22:19,310
Cat throwing knife.

2738
02:22:19,370 --> 02:22:20,050
Paint pot.

2739
02:22:20,750 --> 02:22:21,810
These are known tools.

2740
02:22:21,950 --> 02:22:23,110
You can use them as many as you like.

2741
02:22:23,470 --> 02:22:25,110
Click the play guide for details.

2742
02:22:38,010 --> 02:22:38,490
Yeah?

2743
02:22:41,910 --> 02:22:42,550
What is it?

2744
02:22:43,910 --> 02:22:48,530
Buy consumables such as- So these are just things I can buy.

2745
02:22:49,690 --> 02:22:51,590
I feel like I have a lot of these already.

2746
02:22:53,650 --> 02:22:55,990
Like, I don't have to worry about these yet.

2747
02:22:58,550 --> 02:22:58,990
Okay.

2748
02:23:00,550 --> 02:23:01,050
Oh, yeah?

2749
02:23:07,130 --> 02:23:07,970
Oh, I can upgrade?

2750
02:23:11,270 --> 02:23:11,710
Upgrade...

2751
02:23:11,710 --> 02:23:13,050
My bow, please.

2752
02:23:13,050 --> 02:23:14,870
Oh, wait.

2753
02:23:15,010 --> 02:23:16,230
It's a skill tree.

2754
02:23:20,210 --> 02:23:20,710
Okay.

2755
02:23:23,030 --> 02:23:24,910
I don't have any of these, though.

2756
02:23:25,070 --> 02:23:26,050
I guess I can upgrade.

2757
02:23:31,020 --> 02:23:32,560
Oh, that's interesting.

2758
02:23:33,460 --> 02:23:35,380
In the past, it wasn't a skill tree.

2759
02:23:35,620 --> 02:23:37,450
Okay, in the past, as in 2007.

2760
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:39,490
On the PSP.

2761
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:41,720
It was not a skill tree.

2762
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:42,360
Sorry.

2763
02:23:42,720 --> 02:23:45,580
My history of the past.

2764
02:23:45,580 --> 02:23:47,680
Is 2007.

2765
02:23:48,020 --> 02:23:49,540
And in 2007.

2766
02:23:50,120 --> 02:23:51,780
There was no skill tree.

2767
02:23:55,580 --> 02:23:56,260
Sorry.

2768
02:23:56,480 --> 02:23:56,940
In the...

2769
02:23:56,940 --> 02:24:01,580
In the 1900s.

2770
02:24:06,100 --> 02:24:06,780
Alright.

2771
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:07,980
We got that.

2772
02:24:08,480 --> 02:24:09,400
Do we have, like, more?

2773
02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:10,120
Okay.

2774
02:24:19,820 --> 02:24:21,760
Got an ore from mining.

2775
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:22,140
Okay.

2776
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:29,620
When the dinosaurs roam the Earth.

2777
02:24:32,020 --> 02:24:34,940
When you can have multiple cats.

2778
02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:39,660
Alright.

2779
02:24:44,360 --> 02:24:46,740
Am I in my lobby?

2780
02:24:46,740 --> 02:24:48,260
Where are all the hunters?

2781
02:24:51,220 --> 02:24:52,040
Oh, yeah.

2782
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:52,900
I was going to create a...

2783
02:24:59,860 --> 02:25:02,440
I was making these stickers.

2784
02:25:03,100 --> 02:25:04,020
There's so many.

2785
02:25:04,700 --> 02:25:05,340
Sorry.

2786
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:14,620
Sorry, that's really good.

2787
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:16,240
I'm not allowed to speak.

2788
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:17,980
I don't have rights.

2789
02:25:18,860 --> 02:25:20,640
Oh, my god.

2790
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:22,020
I'm sorry.

2791
02:25:22,140 --> 02:25:23,200
That was really good.

2792
02:25:23,300 --> 02:25:24,640
Okay, let's create another squad.

2793
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:26,820
Squad number two.

2794
02:25:27,860 --> 02:25:29,160
Create new.

2795
02:25:29,500 --> 02:25:31,060
Squad settings.

2796
02:25:32,380 --> 02:25:33,180
Comment.

2797
02:25:36,060 --> 02:25:40,820
If your cat wear clothes, we kick.

2798
02:25:44,720 --> 02:25:45,500
There you go.

2799
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:46,840
Emblem icon.

2800
02:25:47,340 --> 02:25:49,500
Okay, this one...

2801
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:51,740
We'll do, like...

2802
02:25:51,740 --> 02:25:53,500
Okay, it still has to be...

2803
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:56,580
It has to be a cat, but this time we'll make it...

2804
02:25:56,580 --> 02:25:57,960
We'll make it this orange.

2805
02:26:03,460 --> 02:26:03,980
Alright.

2806
02:26:04,680 --> 02:26:05,640
Emblem shape.

2807
02:26:05,740 --> 02:26:07,660
And then, put a cop there.

2808
02:26:08,580 --> 02:26:09,500
A cop emblem.

2809
02:26:10,580 --> 02:26:11,420
The badge.

2810
02:26:11,420 --> 02:26:12,240
Oh, wait, no.

2811
02:26:12,380 --> 02:26:13,160
Yeah, the shield.

2812
02:26:13,360 --> 02:26:14,580
Actually, we could do this, but...

2813
02:26:14,580 --> 02:26:16,700
Oh, we could have different colors.

2814
02:26:16,780 --> 02:26:17,520
We'll do silver.

2815
02:26:18,020 --> 02:26:20,540
Then we'll put the cat as this, but this time we'll have a different shield.

2816
02:26:21,320 --> 02:26:21,600
Okay.

2817
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:27,600
Dragoon2.

2818
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:33,000
Alright.

2819
02:26:33,580 --> 02:26:34,640
This is Dragoon2.

2820
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:35,860
You weren't able to... Okay.

2821
02:26:36,340 --> 02:26:37,580
My leader message.

2822
02:26:39,420 --> 02:26:39,740
Hashtag.

2823
02:26:39,740 --> 02:26:41,580
Cats should not...

2824
02:26:41,580 --> 02:26:43,000
Should not...

2825
02:26:44,220 --> 02:26:45,100
Cats...

2826
02:26:45,100 --> 02:26:46,660
Should not talk.

2827
02:26:53,540 --> 02:26:53,980
Dragoon2.

2828
02:26:57,680 --> 02:26:58,560
Okay.

2829
02:26:59,000 --> 02:26:59,700
There we go.

2830
02:27:01,340 --> 02:27:03,100
That's my second squad.

2831
02:27:04,140 --> 02:27:05,520
There's already four people in here.

2832
02:27:05,720 --> 02:27:06,120
Nice.

2833
02:27:08,380 --> 02:27:09,440
Remember this.

2834
02:27:10,420 --> 02:27:10,980
Nice.

2835
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:12,920
We already have four people in here.

2836
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:14,320
Dragoon2.

2837
02:27:14,460 --> 02:27:14,800
Cat.

2838
02:27:14,940 --> 02:27:15,720
No talk.

2839
02:27:16,680 --> 02:27:17,120
Alright.

2840
02:27:17,240 --> 02:27:17,680
Nice.

2841
02:27:18,780 --> 02:27:20,180
Do I have another mission?

2842
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:25,060
Where's my, like...

2843
02:27:25,060 --> 02:27:25,900
Where do I have...

2844
02:27:25,900 --> 02:27:28,320
Where's the thing where the cats start making me food?

2845
02:27:32,700 --> 02:27:33,940
Check their cats.

2846
02:27:34,860 --> 02:27:36,220
I'll check their cats later.

2847
02:27:36,220 --> 02:27:38,040
I need them... I'm giving them time.

2848
02:27:38,500 --> 02:27:41,320
I'm giving them time to take clothes off their cats.

2849
02:27:42,540 --> 02:27:43,140
Hello.

2850
02:27:45,420 --> 02:27:46,020
Yeah.

2851
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:49,720
Wait, I'm my own chef?

2852
02:27:49,900 --> 02:27:53,040
What's the point of having cats if they can't make me food?

2853
02:28:07,070 --> 02:28:08,590
Oh, an SOS flare.

2854
02:28:08,590 --> 02:28:10,550
Oh, shit.

2855
02:28:12,690 --> 02:28:14,590
Gotta go to the SOS flare.

2856
02:28:17,550 --> 02:28:18,790
I'm alive?

2857
02:28:24,490 --> 02:28:27,310
That was actually an accident.

2858
02:28:27,830 --> 02:28:29,610
Oh my god, I'm alive.

2859
02:28:30,890 --> 02:28:32,750
I don't know how the fuck I lived.

2860
02:28:38,590 --> 02:28:40,210
Oh my god, I lived.

2861
02:28:41,710 --> 02:28:42,830
What is fall damage?

2862
02:28:42,950 --> 02:28:44,530
Yeah, I thought about that too.

2863
02:28:44,650 --> 02:28:46,570
I was like, what the fuck?

2864
02:28:48,790 --> 02:28:50,250
How did I live?

2865
02:28:52,430 --> 02:28:53,510
Wait, I'm not.

2866
02:28:54,570 --> 02:28:55,350
Where's my health?

2867
02:29:07,450 --> 02:29:09,470
Granny's have perfect knees.

2868
02:29:11,030 --> 02:29:11,970
Wait, are these the chefs?

2869
02:29:12,170 --> 02:29:13,730
Oh my god, they're the chefs!

2870
02:29:14,910 --> 02:29:15,890
Thank god.

2871
02:29:16,490 --> 02:29:18,070
I knew I'd never...

2872
02:29:18,070 --> 02:29:20,030
Thank god I don't have to make my own food.

2873
02:29:30,160 --> 02:29:33,000
The only reason they're in danger is because they're wearing clothes.

2874
02:29:36,790 --> 02:29:37,670
Let's go!

2875
02:29:49,580 --> 02:29:51,620
It's because it's their job!

2876
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:54,240
And they don't have the meat.

2877
02:29:54,280 --> 02:29:55,740
Then what is there use for?

2878
02:30:01,310 --> 02:30:02,230
Get on!

2879
02:30:02,610 --> 02:30:02,950
Hurry!

2880
02:30:05,990 --> 02:30:07,230
Are we allowed to?

2881
02:30:07,470 --> 02:30:08,370
We can talk about it later.

2882
02:30:08,870 --> 02:30:09,830
We have to follow them.

2883
02:30:10,350 --> 02:30:11,330
Follow them?

2884
02:30:11,450 --> 02:30:11,730
Follow.

2885
02:30:15,880 --> 02:30:17,940
Yeah, don't waste food, guys.

2886
02:30:19,020 --> 02:30:20,180
We'll meet up later.

2887
02:30:28,040 --> 02:30:29,160
Free the cat.

2888
02:30:31,220 --> 02:30:32,260
It's so weird.

2889
02:30:32,400 --> 02:30:34,840
All the other cats have clothes and then there's Garfield.

2890
02:30:42,870 --> 02:30:43,950
Be free.

2891
02:30:44,950 --> 02:30:45,990
Go, go,

2892
02:30:58,110 --> 02:30:58,590
go, go!

2893
02:30:58,730 --> 02:31:04,050
Oh my god, they have little mittens so their dirty cat paws won't infect the meat.

2894
02:31:08,790 --> 02:31:09,690
Is that a chicken?

2895
02:31:11,910 --> 02:31:13,230
Wait, what the fuck?

2896
02:31:13,770 --> 02:31:16,290
Oh my god, that was an accident!

2897
02:31:18,710 --> 02:31:21,330
I was trying to get...

2898
02:31:21,330 --> 02:31:23,530
I was like, what the fuck did I put down?

2899
02:31:24,910 --> 02:31:27,710
Actually, I did not mean to do that.

2900
02:31:28,610 --> 02:31:29,090
Yeah.

2901
02:31:30,730 --> 02:31:32,130
If it works, guys.

2902
02:31:32,370 --> 02:31:33,030
If it works.

2903
02:31:33,650 --> 02:31:35,550
It kinda works, yeah.

2904
02:31:38,230 --> 02:31:39,090
I mean, it worked.

2905
02:31:39,170 --> 02:31:40,250
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

2906
02:31:40,370 --> 02:31:40,650
Nice.

2907
02:31:41,690 --> 02:31:42,170
Nice.

2908
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:46,400
Oops.

2909
02:31:46,660 --> 02:31:47,760
I didn't mean to do that.

2910
02:31:49,240 --> 02:31:51,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2911
02:31:54,470 --> 02:31:54,950
Wait.

2912
02:31:55,430 --> 02:31:57,290
I need...

2913
02:31:57,290 --> 02:31:57,650
Oh.

2914
02:31:59,210 --> 02:31:59,610
Nice.

2915
02:32:03,470 --> 02:32:04,870
Wait, oh, I can do this.

2916
02:32:05,150 --> 02:32:05,810
What the fuck?

2917
02:32:05,890 --> 02:32:06,990
How did you get in my lobby?

2918
02:32:08,670 --> 02:32:10,590
Wait, how did all of you guys get in my lobby?

2919
02:32:13,590 --> 02:32:14,470
Alright, nice.

2920
02:32:15,290 --> 02:32:16,370
Wait, you guys have...

2921
02:32:18,130 --> 02:32:18,530
Horses?

2922
02:32:18,730 --> 02:32:19,430
Or birds?

2923
02:32:20,610 --> 02:32:21,410
Where's Garfield?

2924
02:32:23,350 --> 02:32:23,750
No!

2925
02:32:23,850 --> 02:32:24,650
Where's Garfield?

2926
02:32:25,530 --> 02:32:26,610
I forgot.

2927
02:32:27,110 --> 02:32:28,770
Wait, you can't use your cats?

2928
02:32:32,090 --> 02:32:34,090
Wait, you cannot use your cats?

2929
02:32:34,430 --> 02:32:35,590
It's like...

2930
02:32:37,090 --> 02:32:38,170
It's like...

2931
02:32:38,170 --> 02:32:40,810
It's like...

2932
02:32:41,370 --> 02:32:42,770
Oh wait, I have the charge.

2933
02:32:44,610 --> 02:32:45,150
Nice.

2934
02:32:46,790 --> 02:32:47,710
Oh my god, don't worry.

2935
02:32:47,770 --> 02:32:48,690
I'm doing it.

2936
02:32:49,070 --> 02:32:50,530
I'm so good at this.

2937
02:32:52,490 --> 02:32:52,790
Oh!

2938
02:32:53,270 --> 02:32:54,290
And there's people.

2939
02:32:54,490 --> 02:32:55,370
Oh, I see.

2940
02:32:57,270 --> 02:32:58,610
Okay, don't worry guys.

2941
02:32:58,690 --> 02:32:59,790
I'm doing my job.

2942
02:33:03,870 --> 02:33:05,710
My one damage.

2943
02:33:07,430 --> 02:33:09,010
Don't worry guys.

2944
02:33:09,190 --> 02:33:11,590
You are my Garfield now.

2945
02:33:12,070 --> 02:33:13,390
But this game is easy.

2946
02:33:13,390 --> 02:33:13,550
Pew!

2947
02:33:24,150 --> 02:33:25,470
Oh shit, guys!

2948
02:33:25,530 --> 02:33:26,470
I'm the bowman!

2949
02:33:27,650 --> 02:33:28,490
Nice.

2950
02:33:30,490 --> 02:33:32,090
Oh my god.

2951
02:33:32,630 --> 02:33:32,950
Pew!

2952
02:33:35,130 --> 02:33:35,970
Pew!

2953
02:33:37,070 --> 02:33:37,490
Pew!

2954
02:33:38,850 --> 02:33:41,150
This shot could end the war.

2955
02:33:41,690 --> 02:33:43,730
Easiest game of my life.

2956
02:33:44,290 --> 02:33:44,910
Look at that.

2957
02:33:45,110 --> 02:33:45,410
Pew!

2958
02:33:45,970 --> 02:33:46,490
Pew!

2959
02:33:46,910 --> 02:33:47,050
Pew!

2960
02:33:47,590 --> 02:33:47,790
Pew!

2961
02:33:47,790 --> 02:33:53,310
Wait, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, I'm the bowman here.

2962
02:33:53,570 --> 02:33:55,690
Guys, why is he aggro to me, guys?

2963
02:33:58,370 --> 02:33:58,830
Okay.

2964
02:33:59,090 --> 02:34:02,350
Put them here because I accidentally put my barrel down.

2965
02:34:03,230 --> 02:34:03,750
Ow.

2966
02:34:05,410 --> 02:34:07,490
I can shoot my own barrel.

2967
02:34:08,350 --> 02:34:10,030
Nobody told me that.

2968
02:34:11,170 --> 02:34:14,130
Nobody told me I could shoot my own barrel.

2969
02:34:14,130 --> 02:34:16,350
Nobody told me.

2970
02:34:16,870 --> 02:34:18,290
Okay, I know now.

2971
02:34:19,530 --> 02:34:22,430
Guys, I now know I can shoot my own barrel.

2972
02:34:25,790 --> 02:34:29,050
Guys, I didn't know that!

2973
02:34:30,770 --> 02:34:32,490
Okay, what's a Paratone?

2974
02:34:33,150 --> 02:34:33,990
He's like limping.

2975
02:34:34,090 --> 02:34:35,390
I feel like he's almost dead.

2976
02:34:37,130 --> 02:34:39,330
Where's my little bird?

2977
02:34:40,690 --> 02:34:41,730
Where is he?

2978
02:34:41,730 --> 02:34:42,970
Oh, there he is.

2979
02:34:43,270 --> 02:34:44,710
Wait, guys, wait up!

2980
02:34:46,050 --> 02:34:47,650
Guys, wait up!

2981
02:34:49,650 --> 02:34:50,030
Nice.

2982
02:34:50,490 --> 02:34:51,090
Okay.

2983
02:34:51,710 --> 02:34:52,530
Watch this.

2984
02:34:53,830 --> 02:34:54,890
I feel like... Okay.

2985
02:34:55,850 --> 02:34:56,670
I'll shoot his knees.

2986
02:34:57,530 --> 02:34:57,910
Nice.

2987
02:34:58,590 --> 02:34:59,430
And then...

2988
02:34:59,430 --> 02:34:59,590
Pew!

2989
02:35:02,910 --> 02:35:03,670
Pew!

2990
02:35:07,070 --> 02:35:07,830
Pew!

2991
02:35:09,130 --> 02:35:10,150
Look at that.

2992
02:35:10,610 --> 02:35:12,510
Oh my God, that's so easy.

2993
02:35:19,020 --> 02:35:20,840
Easiest game of my life.

2994
02:35:21,300 --> 02:35:21,620
Yeah!

2995
02:35:25,100 --> 02:35:26,840
Oh, is cutting the tail good?

2996
02:35:32,590 --> 02:35:33,470
Where's the tail?

2997
02:35:34,490 --> 02:35:35,010
Is this?

2998
02:35:36,750 --> 02:35:38,250
Oh, wait, is this the tail?

2999
02:35:41,350 --> 02:35:42,690
Oh my God, free stuff!

3000
02:35:45,150 --> 02:35:46,050
I did it.

3001
02:35:46,090 --> 02:35:47,450
I cut the tail off, guys.

3002
02:35:48,530 --> 02:35:49,690
Guys, I did that.

3003
02:35:53,960 --> 02:35:54,440
Nice.

3004
02:35:55,560 --> 02:35:56,920
Oh, and I can grab this.

3005
02:35:59,040 --> 02:36:00,140
Guys, I did it.

3006
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:03,200
Of course I'd get the rare drops.

3007
02:36:03,240 --> 02:36:04,100
I'm just that good.

3008
02:36:05,480 --> 02:36:06,220
Oh, wait, I should...

3009
02:36:06,980 --> 02:36:07,860
mine that.

3010
02:36:11,250 --> 02:36:12,310
I should mine that.

3011
02:36:12,470 --> 02:36:13,190
This is important.

3012
02:36:13,510 --> 02:36:14,170
Earth crystals.

3013
02:36:15,450 --> 02:36:16,330
Is there anything else?

3014
02:36:17,610 --> 02:36:18,790
A lily rose?

3015
02:36:18,790 --> 02:36:19,950
What the fuck is that?

3016
02:36:20,290 --> 02:36:21,090
Oh, it's a bone pile.

3017
02:36:21,170 --> 02:36:21,470
No!

3018
02:36:22,650 --> 02:36:23,170
No!

3019
02:36:29,070 --> 02:36:30,850
My bone pile!

3020
02:36:35,140 --> 02:36:36,400
God damn it.

3021
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:38,020
My fucking bone pile.

3022
02:36:44,910 --> 02:36:47,290
I can't believe it.

3023
02:36:49,630 --> 02:36:50,210
Look at that!

3024
02:36:50,210 --> 02:36:51,550
Number of focus.

3025
02:36:51,730 --> 02:36:53,330
Look at that.

3026
02:36:53,730 --> 02:36:55,490
Alan has nothing.

3027
02:36:55,910 --> 02:36:57,630
That means he did nothing.

3028
02:37:00,290 --> 02:37:02,090
Look at that.

3029
02:37:02,770 --> 02:37:05,210
Lily rose with the parts broken.

3030
02:37:06,030 --> 02:37:08,810
Me with the focus strikes on wounds.

3031
02:37:09,450 --> 02:37:11,850
Husky with the support all star.

3032
02:37:12,070 --> 02:37:14,050
What did Alan do?

3033
02:37:14,050 --> 02:37:14,170
What did he do?

3034
02:37:18,570 --> 02:37:19,530
That's right.

3035
02:37:20,330 --> 02:37:22,210
What did he do?

3036
02:37:27,050 --> 02:37:27,710
Oh, nice.

3037
02:37:27,810 --> 02:37:28,630
I do get my bones.

3038
02:37:28,850 --> 02:37:29,530
Oh, okay.

3039
02:37:30,010 --> 02:37:30,490
That's fine.

3040
02:37:30,550 --> 02:37:32,290
I got my bones before we headed back.

3041
02:37:46,280 --> 02:37:47,240
We do.

3042
02:37:47,240 --> 02:37:47,320
We do.

3043
02:37:47,420 --> 02:37:48,440
I can't walk.

3044
02:37:50,660 --> 02:37:51,960
Don't make me walk.

3045
02:37:58,040 --> 02:37:58,600
Yeah!

3046
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:03,720
That's me talking about me.

3047
02:38:12,660 --> 02:38:13,580
Oh shit!

3048
02:38:13,820 --> 02:38:15,380
Oh, so I can bring my other weapon.

3049
02:38:17,380 --> 02:38:19,700
I like the bow so far.

3050
02:38:23,320 --> 02:38:24,980
Yeah, use the dual blades.

3051
02:38:32,820 --> 02:38:36,060
That bow gun and bow.

3052
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:39,160
We do, bro.

3053
02:38:45,400 --> 02:38:48,700
Oh, by the way, everyone's been asking about you.

3054
02:38:50,140 --> 02:38:50,780
Me?

3055
02:38:51,800 --> 02:38:53,040
Oh my god!

3056
02:38:53,860 --> 02:38:55,380
I'm hunter rank number two now.

3057
02:38:56,780 --> 02:38:57,140
Okay.

3058
02:39:00,060 --> 02:39:02,240
Talk to Tom at the ingredients.

3059
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:03,140
Talk to Ferdinand.

3060
02:39:03,700 --> 02:39:05,440
How many people are in my guild now?

3061
02:39:06,940 --> 02:39:09,480
Wait, I keep pressing right click instead.

3062
02:39:11,720 --> 02:39:13,000
17 people!

3063
02:39:16,870 --> 02:39:17,390
17!

3064
02:39:18,410 --> 02:39:19,930
Alright, I'm gonna check.

3065
02:39:20,050 --> 02:39:20,690
If you guys...

3066
02:39:20,690 --> 02:39:23,450
I swear, if your cats are wearing clothes, I'm gonna know.

3067
02:39:24,930 --> 02:39:25,950
I'm gonna know.

3068
02:39:26,090 --> 02:39:27,010
There we go.

3069
02:39:27,770 --> 02:39:28,570
That's good.

3070
02:39:28,730 --> 02:39:29,990
I'm glad we all know.

3071
02:39:30,150 --> 02:39:30,970
We all know.

3072
02:39:33,310 --> 02:39:36,350
I'm glad we're all on the same page, guys.

3073
02:39:36,850 --> 02:39:37,730
That's good.

3074
02:39:37,830 --> 02:39:40,670
I'm glad we're all on the same page, everybody.

3075
02:39:40,670 --> 02:39:40,890
What?

3076
02:40:15,110 --> 02:40:16,370
But you're here.

3077
02:40:19,580 --> 02:40:20,780
You're here.

3078
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:23,580
You're literally here.

3079
02:40:24,740 --> 02:40:27,440
You have a cat that makes food!

3080
02:40:28,400 --> 02:40:29,580
Cook for me!

3081
02:40:31,360 --> 02:40:32,120
Tom!

3082
02:40:32,460 --> 02:40:36,100
I should've let that fucking monster eat you, Tom.

3083
02:40:38,260 --> 02:40:41,920
I should've fucking... Why does this cat have nose?

3084
02:40:42,480 --> 02:40:43,140
God damn.

3085
02:40:43,160 --> 02:40:44,640
I can make my own food?

3086
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:49,480
Custom meals?

3087
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:50,800
Recommended meals?

3088
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:52,760
Prepare a meal.

3089
02:40:53,560 --> 02:40:55,480
Cook only with rations?

3090
02:40:55,640 --> 02:40:56,780
Does he cook for me?

3091
02:41:00,700 --> 02:41:01,400
What is this?

3092
02:41:01,420 --> 02:41:02,440
Health and stamina.

3093
02:41:04,380 --> 02:41:04,760
Okay.

3094
02:41:09,980 --> 02:41:11,640
I have to cook my own meal?

3095
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:13,100
My cat's right here!

3096
02:41:13,620 --> 02:41:15,120
He's watching me!

3097
02:41:15,280 --> 02:41:16,220
Fucking Garfield.

3098
02:41:16,860 --> 02:41:22,950
Oh my god.

3099
02:41:22,950 --> 02:41:26,290
Garfield has to watch me cook?

3100
02:41:28,030 --> 02:41:29,810
He's all this fucking fat ass.

3101
02:41:30,640 --> 02:41:32,450
He's like, yep.

3102
02:41:33,130 --> 02:41:34,670
That's right.

3103
02:41:38,860 --> 02:41:40,870
What the fuck?

3104
02:41:41,290 --> 02:41:41,950
He's like, yep.

3105
02:41:46,810 --> 02:41:48,630
Lore accurate.

3106
02:41:51,570 --> 02:41:52,290
Lore accurate.

3107
02:41:52,290 --> 02:41:54,050
Cook that lasagna, Jon.

3108
02:42:00,950 --> 02:42:03,110
Lore accurate, Garfield.

3109
02:42:04,470 --> 02:42:06,030
Can't believe I have to cook.

3110
02:42:06,130 --> 02:42:07,790
I have to cook my own meals?

3111
02:42:09,210 --> 02:42:11,010
Oh my god.

3112
02:42:11,730 --> 02:42:12,750
I can't believe.

3113
02:42:12,910 --> 02:42:14,410
I was not expecting that.

3114
02:42:15,050 --> 02:42:17,290
Jon, I'm so hungry.

3115
02:42:22,750 --> 02:42:24,630
I need to talk to Nova.

3116
02:42:35,070 --> 02:42:36,730
I can't believe it.

3117
02:42:36,790 --> 02:42:37,590
I'm so sad.

3118
02:42:39,370 --> 02:42:41,710
Why are you holding up?

3119
02:42:48,270 --> 02:42:51,890
What's the point of owning cats if they don't cook my food?

3120
02:42:53,670 --> 02:42:55,190
They'll sing me a song.

3121
02:42:56,590 --> 02:42:58,510
Why won't they sing me a song?

3122
02:43:26,760 --> 02:43:27,280
Oh.

3123
02:43:29,260 --> 02:43:29,780
Oh.

3124
02:43:29,780 --> 02:43:30,540
That's always sad.

3125
02:43:35,220 --> 02:43:37,520
Look, I'm still young at heart, guys.

3126
02:43:38,260 --> 02:43:41,960
I might have been born in the 1900's but I'm still young at heart.

3127
02:43:45,660 --> 02:43:47,140
Cook for yourself.

3128
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:48,200
Fuck you, Alan.

3129
02:43:48,200 --> 02:43:50,840
You didn't get shit done during that fight.

3130
02:43:50,840 --> 02:43:53,680
You had no achievements in that fight.

3131
02:44:02,750 --> 02:44:03,390
Alright.

3132
02:44:04,050 --> 02:44:04,950
What do I do?

3133
02:44:06,750 --> 02:44:07,550
Who's this guy?

3134
02:44:14,090 --> 02:44:16,050
What the fuck?

3135
02:44:19,250 --> 02:44:20,590
Is he a person?

3136
02:44:22,750 --> 02:44:23,830
Wait, what is he?

3137
02:44:24,470 --> 02:44:26,470
Why does he look like that?

3138
02:44:29,470 --> 02:44:30,350
Oh, this is...

3139
02:44:30,350 --> 02:44:32,550
We killed all of these guys.

3140
02:44:36,530 --> 02:44:37,870
What's a wyverian?

3141
02:44:40,470 --> 02:44:41,570
Oh, is he an elf?

3142
02:44:52,650 --> 02:44:54,330
Do they...

3143
02:44:54,330 --> 02:44:56,090
What are they on the hierarchy?

3144
02:45:03,140 --> 02:45:03,500
Okay.

3145
02:45:04,200 --> 02:45:07,000
Are they like...

3146
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:10,560
What kind of elves are they?

3147
02:45:11,540 --> 02:45:12,820
The top?

3148
02:45:16,830 --> 02:45:18,510
He's just like a guy.

3149
02:45:18,510 --> 02:45:18,950
Is he a cat?

3150
02:45:19,030 --> 02:45:19,690
No, it can't be.

3151
02:45:19,730 --> 02:45:20,830
Because he's wearing clothes.

3152
02:45:23,310 --> 02:45:24,550
It can't be.

3153
02:45:24,690 --> 02:45:25,470
They have clothes.

3154
02:45:26,050 --> 02:45:27,890
Alright, I'm checking your cats, guys.

3155
02:45:28,250 --> 02:45:29,410
I'm checking your cats.

3156
02:45:29,990 --> 02:45:31,670
Bring up the cats, everybody.

3157
02:45:32,330 --> 02:45:32,990
I swear.

3158
02:45:33,610 --> 02:45:35,950
Alright, whose cat is this?

3159
02:45:36,710 --> 02:45:38,030
Whose cat is this?

3160
02:45:38,090 --> 02:45:40,170
And why is he wearing clothes?

3161
02:45:41,510 --> 02:45:44,210
I like to report a cat with clothes.

3162
02:45:44,730 --> 02:45:46,190
It's cat inspection time.

3163
02:45:46,190 --> 02:45:47,830
Whose cat is this?

3164
02:45:48,190 --> 02:45:49,090
Who is it?

3165
02:45:52,830 --> 02:45:55,370
Whose fucking cat is this?

3166
02:45:58,470 --> 02:46:00,210
Is this your cat?

3167
02:46:00,790 --> 02:46:02,030
Miss Lily Rose?

3168
02:46:02,690 --> 02:46:03,790
Is this your cat?

3169
02:46:04,730 --> 02:46:05,730
Is this your cat?

3170
02:46:05,810 --> 02:46:06,950
Why is he wearing clothes?

3171
02:46:11,130 --> 02:46:16,270
One of you brought a clothed kitty and I'm gonna find out who it is.

3172
02:46:20,450 --> 02:46:22,270
It's inspection time.

3173
02:46:24,650 --> 02:46:26,630
This is a no clothes area.

3174
02:46:29,010 --> 02:46:31,410
Okay, talk to Alma.

3175
02:46:32,030 --> 02:46:33,610
Where the fuck are they?

3176
02:46:33,810 --> 02:46:34,610
Oh, they're over here.

3177
02:46:35,730 --> 02:46:37,510
Wait, I need to talk to Alma first.

3178
02:46:38,830 --> 02:46:39,730
Yeah, I do.

3179
02:46:46,570 --> 02:46:47,090
Uh...

3180
02:46:47,090 --> 02:46:49,190
Yo, tell me more about yourself.

3181
02:46:54,030 --> 02:46:55,990
Of course it's Alan's cat.

3182
02:47:10,050 --> 02:47:11,550
It's not a news call, Liam.

3183
02:47:11,550 --> 02:47:12,430
It's just the cats.

3184
02:47:14,510 --> 02:47:16,250
Nexi, thank you for the super chat.

3185
02:47:16,350 --> 02:47:17,530
Thank you, thank you.

3186
02:47:32,070 --> 02:47:32,550
Oh,

3187
02:47:35,790 --> 02:47:36,090
shit.

3188
02:47:37,150 --> 02:47:38,310
I shouldn't have asked the cats?

3189
02:47:38,850 --> 02:47:39,310
What?

3190
02:47:42,450 --> 02:47:44,110
Alright, let's see.

3191
02:47:44,310 --> 02:47:45,830
Can I join...

3192
02:47:45,830 --> 02:47:46,810
Do I have other quests yet?

3193
02:47:46,950 --> 02:47:48,550
Oh, I'm finished all of them.

3194
02:47:50,990 --> 02:47:51,890
Okay, settings.

3195
02:47:52,090 --> 02:47:53,150
I wanna do...

3196
02:47:53,150 --> 02:47:55,530
Okay, if I do two...

3197
02:47:55,530 --> 02:47:58,310
If I do two, does that mean like...

3198
02:47:59,270 --> 02:47:59,730
Uh...

3199
02:48:01,370 --> 02:48:01,830
Uh...

3200
02:48:02,530 --> 02:48:02,990
Uh...

3201
02:48:02,990 --> 02:48:05,990
I can have the cats fight for me as well?

3202
02:48:05,990 --> 02:48:08,090
I wanna have the cats fight for me too.

3203
02:48:11,090 --> 02:48:11,990
Or is it...

3204
02:48:13,090 --> 02:48:14,990
Is it only two max?

3205
02:48:17,390 --> 02:48:19,950
Two stays with... Oh, I want the cats to stay.

3206
02:48:20,530 --> 02:48:21,810
I want the cats to stay.

3207
02:48:27,150 --> 02:48:27,630
Alright.

3208
02:48:33,400 --> 02:48:34,260
Yeah, I'm ready.

3209
02:48:37,800 --> 02:48:39,000
Alright, let's head out.

3210
02:48:43,020 --> 02:48:43,700
I want...

3211
02:48:43,700 --> 02:48:45,980
I want Garfield to join me in my fight.

3212
02:48:47,380 --> 02:48:47,800
Yoink.

3213
02:48:49,840 --> 02:48:50,260
Yoink.

3214
02:48:51,960 --> 02:48:52,800
Take your wallet.

3215
02:48:55,440 --> 02:48:57,080
I don't know what to do with all of these.

3216
02:48:57,880 --> 02:48:59,380
I haven't used any of my items yet.

3217
02:49:05,590 --> 02:49:06,290
Capturing it.

3218
02:49:07,570 --> 02:49:08,170
Oh, shit.

3219
02:49:08,930 --> 02:49:09,570
Not what I wanted.

3220
02:49:09,570 --> 02:49:10,990
Shit.

3221
02:49:11,550 --> 02:49:14,030
What's this?

3222
02:49:16,450 --> 02:49:18,670
Where's my fucking hook?

3223
02:49:24,410 --> 02:49:26,050
Oh, okay, there we go.

3224
02:49:26,650 --> 02:49:27,110
Yoink.

3225
02:49:27,990 --> 02:49:28,750
Yoink.

3226
02:49:33,270 --> 02:49:35,250
I'm gonna hoard everything.

3227
02:49:35,730 --> 02:49:36,270
Honey!

3228
02:49:44,120 --> 02:49:45,240
Hello?

3229
02:49:45,240 --> 02:49:45,380
Hello?

3230
02:49:45,740 --> 02:49:46,640
Can I be let in?

3231
02:50:07,390 --> 02:50:08,790
Oh my god.

3232
02:50:08,870 --> 02:50:10,670
They finally let my cat in.

3233
02:50:11,850 --> 02:50:12,350
Guys.

3234
02:50:12,710 --> 02:50:13,410
Look at that.

3235
02:50:14,050 --> 02:50:14,450
See?

3236
02:50:15,270 --> 02:50:17,010
Doesn't matter if you don't wear clothes.

3237
02:50:17,010 --> 02:50:17,970
You can still enter.

3238
02:50:20,330 --> 02:50:21,690
What the fuck?

3239
02:50:25,880 --> 02:50:26,340
Yeah.

3240
02:50:27,860 --> 02:50:30,400
They finally accepted him for who he is.

3241
02:50:33,640 --> 02:50:33,980
Oh.

3242
02:50:35,940 --> 02:50:37,500
So that's why it...

3243
02:50:37,500 --> 02:50:39,080
Wait, it doesn't work on the Palicos?

3244
02:50:55,500 --> 02:50:56,900
What's that on her back?

3245
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:58,040
It's huge!

3246
02:51:02,340 --> 02:51:05,180
I guess they really haven't seen a weapon before.

3247
02:51:08,420 --> 02:51:08,900
Wait.

3248
02:51:09,280 --> 02:51:10,260
This is okay.

3249
02:51:10,420 --> 02:51:11,420
That guy is okay.

3250
02:51:12,200 --> 02:51:14,080
Oh, are these like the baby for...

3251
02:51:14,080 --> 02:51:16,620
Oh, they're like the babies for the little horses.

3252
02:51:17,400 --> 02:51:19,720
I'll tell my family to start getting everything ready for you.

3253
02:51:26,380 --> 02:51:27,500
Okay.

3254
02:51:35,340 --> 02:51:37,820
Be free, Garfield.

3255
02:51:38,500 --> 02:51:39,380
Be free!

3256
02:51:49,210 --> 02:51:50,330
Goddammit.

3257
02:51:50,490 --> 02:51:50,790
Oh, wait.

3258
02:51:51,470 --> 02:51:53,270
Guys, you can't...

3259
02:51:53,270 --> 02:51:53,610
Guys.

3260
02:51:54,370 --> 02:51:56,770
You can't take out your bow in this town.

3261
02:51:58,430 --> 02:52:00,330
I was gonna do one thing.

3262
02:52:03,910 --> 02:52:05,170
Talk to Elder...

3263
02:52:05,170 --> 02:52:05,610
Ella?

3264
02:52:06,450 --> 02:52:08,490
Talk to the woman tending to the fire?

3265
02:52:09,270 --> 02:52:10,050
Oh, this way.

3266
02:52:13,590 --> 02:52:14,210
Hello.

3267
02:52:15,410 --> 02:52:16,410
Hello, Granny.

3268
02:52:23,390 --> 02:52:25,590
Is that child okay?

3269
02:52:26,070 --> 02:52:27,610
Is that baby okay?

3270
02:52:28,870 --> 02:52:30,670
Why is his legs like that?

3271
02:52:34,940 --> 02:52:35,620
Oh,

3272
02:52:43,500 --> 02:52:44,560
it's my friend from high school.

3273
02:52:45,560 --> 02:52:47,680
Oh my god, it's been a while, Ella.

3274
02:52:48,620 --> 02:52:50,520
You look terrible.

3275
02:52:54,760 --> 02:52:55,380
Oh, wait, no.

3276
02:52:55,640 --> 02:52:56,300
Oh, you're right.

3277
02:52:56,420 --> 02:52:58,240
It's that kid I used to babysit.

3278
02:53:28,940 --> 02:53:29,380
Keepers?

3279
02:53:33,940 --> 02:53:34,060
Keepers?

3280
02:53:35,080 --> 02:53:35,520
Me?

3281
02:53:39,960 --> 02:53:41,960
Aww, you shouldn't have.

3282
02:53:42,100 --> 02:53:42,620
I know.

3283
02:53:44,360 --> 02:53:46,100
I go to the gym, bro.

3284
02:53:47,360 --> 02:53:48,940
How else am I gonna keep that six pack?

3285
02:53:57,420 --> 02:53:58,920
I just lift, bro.

3286
02:53:59,320 --> 02:54:01,500
No, she's talking about me, guys.

3287
02:54:01,580 --> 02:54:02,280
It's me.

3288
02:54:05,900 --> 02:54:08,300
She was talking about me, guys.

3289
02:54:10,760 --> 02:54:12,540
Where's the woman tending to the fire?

3290
02:54:12,700 --> 02:54:13,900
Oh, she's over here.

3291
02:54:18,360 --> 02:54:19,400
And moisturizer.

3292
02:54:19,400 --> 02:54:19,420
Moisturizer.

3293
02:54:19,440 --> 02:54:22,680
Milk drops?

3294
02:54:23,200 --> 02:54:38,460
What does it do?

3295
02:54:46,280 --> 02:54:48,240
I don't know.

3296
02:54:48,300 --> 02:54:48,700
I know.

3297
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:49,020
Actually, yeah.

3298
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:50,340
Did she follow us?

3299
02:54:50,880 --> 02:54:52,500
How did she know this place?

3300
02:54:54,240 --> 02:54:56,440
Like, did she fucking follow us?

3301
02:54:58,260 --> 02:55:03,100
It was like me, that guy, and like the other girl.

3302
02:55:21,060 --> 02:55:22,440
Hello, everybody!

3303
02:55:47,620 --> 02:55:48,100
Thanks.

3304
02:55:49,460 --> 02:55:50,780
Please, have a seat.

3305
02:55:53,940 --> 02:55:56,780
Thank you so much again for your warm hospitality.

3306
02:55:58,440 --> 02:56:00,260
It's the very least we can do.

3307
02:56:01,140 --> 02:56:04,100
Finally, somebody's gonna cook for me.

3308
02:56:04,820 --> 02:56:06,620
What the fuck is that?

3309
02:56:13,570 --> 02:56:14,690
Big beans?

3310
02:56:18,140 --> 02:56:19,180
It looks so tasty.

3311
02:56:19,220 --> 02:56:19,980
Is that pizza?

3312
02:56:19,980 --> 02:56:20,860
Pizza?

3313
02:56:25,780 --> 02:56:28,440
I was gonna say, am I in the UK right now?

3314
02:56:33,700 --> 02:56:34,180
Oh,

3315
02:56:37,980 --> 02:56:39,300
that looks good, though.

3316
02:56:39,380 --> 02:56:40,380
Yeah, that looks like nan.

3317
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:42,580
That looks good.

3318
02:56:44,480 --> 02:56:45,120
That looks good.

3319
02:56:46,520 --> 02:56:49,520
I don't know about the big beans part, though.

3320
02:56:55,900 --> 02:56:58,160
Yeah, go Garfield, go.

3321
02:57:00,800 --> 02:57:01,440
Oh!

3322
02:57:04,380 --> 02:57:06,160
Is that mozzarella?

3323
02:57:06,580 --> 02:57:07,980
Oh, the cheese!

3324
02:57:08,100 --> 02:57:11,040
You know it's good cheese when that- oh my god.

3325
02:57:14,720 --> 02:57:15,600
That's good cheese.

3326
02:57:21,160 --> 02:57:22,600
Forgot about my pig tails.

3327
02:57:26,140 --> 02:57:27,540
That's right, you see these abs?

3328
02:57:27,760 --> 02:57:29,560
Those are granny abs right there.

3329
02:57:42,320 --> 02:57:44,760
That's how granny dookies taste, bitch.

3330
02:57:49,770 --> 02:57:53,250
We sighted a monster with long, thick fur near the village.

3331
02:57:54,110 --> 02:57:56,030
That sounds like a doshakuma.

3332
02:57:56,710 --> 02:57:58,870
They never used to venture out of the forest.

3333
02:58:00,810 --> 02:58:01,890
There's a forest?

3334
02:58:01,930 --> 02:58:03,830
There's a forest in Sandland?

3335
02:58:04,130 --> 02:58:06,310
Oh my god, we're going to Forestland!

3336
02:58:07,590 --> 02:58:09,210
We can never escape!

3337
02:58:10,750 --> 02:58:13,810
They attack our livestock, so we keep them panned up here.

3338
02:58:14,930 --> 02:58:17,190
We're going back to Forestland!

3339
02:58:17,190 --> 02:58:20,090
A bunch of ornaments make you feel safe?

3340
02:58:21,090 --> 02:58:25,130
Yes, you see, this region is home to a creature that even the doshakuma fear.

3341
02:58:26,130 --> 02:58:29,590
And it just so happens that the gem chimestones sound a lot like that monster.

3342
02:58:31,130 --> 02:58:33,010
And that's enough of a deterrent.

3343
02:58:33,510 --> 02:58:34,010
Interesting.

3344
02:58:35,210 --> 02:58:37,050
We played these games before!

3345
02:58:41,060 --> 02:58:42,940
I suppose we'll take our leave now.

3346
02:58:43,280 --> 02:58:44,580
Thank you for the wonderful food.

3347
02:58:44,580 --> 02:58:46,800
I don't need to know much about the sandstorm.

3348
02:58:46,800 --> 02:58:49,040
I don't care about nata, I'm sorry.

3349
02:58:50,480 --> 02:58:53,880
That's very kind, but we know how much preparing you have to do for the sandstorm.

3350
02:58:54,980 --> 02:58:56,120
Thanks for the grub!

3351
02:58:56,320 --> 02:58:57,800
Best I've had in ages!

3352
02:59:02,550 --> 02:59:04,490
That's fucking coarse, Garfield.

3353
02:59:04,830 --> 02:59:05,350
Thank you.

3354
02:59:07,010 --> 02:59:08,650
Let's start heading back to base camp.

3355
02:59:13,620 --> 02:59:15,960
I don't know, I just don't care about nata.

3356
02:59:16,860 --> 02:59:17,580
In this lore.

3357
02:59:21,360 --> 02:59:22,420
So, what's next?

3358
02:59:24,800 --> 02:59:25,920
Let's head to the forest.

3359
02:59:27,600 --> 02:59:31,060
Right, and maybe we should look into the doshakuma while we're at it.

3360
02:59:34,860 --> 02:59:36,820
But for today, let's rest.

3361
02:59:37,200 --> 02:59:39,020
We can start our investigation fresh tomorrow.

3362
02:59:39,220 --> 02:59:39,540
Alright.

3363
02:59:41,260 --> 02:59:42,400
Nata can ride with me.

3364
02:59:42,740 --> 02:59:45,560
How about we meet up on the path to the forest and go from there?

3365
02:59:46,380 --> 02:59:49,380
Alright, see you all tomorrow.

3366
02:59:49,400 --> 02:59:50,660
Alright, take care, Garfield.

3367
02:59:53,400 --> 02:59:55,060
We did it, Garfield!

3368
02:59:56,300 --> 02:59:57,780
We completed the quest!

3369
02:59:58,980 --> 03:00:00,820
I'm so good at this game.

3370
03:00:02,140 --> 03:00:03,500
Oh, I got a...

3371
03:00:03,500 --> 03:00:04,820
Oh, I got a new gesture!

3372
03:00:05,600 --> 03:00:07,140
Wait, how do I use gestures?

3373
03:00:11,820 --> 03:00:13,060
Nice, now he's...

3374
03:00:13,060 --> 03:00:14,320
Now he's naked.

3375
03:00:14,700 --> 03:00:15,200
Good.

3376
03:00:16,480 --> 03:00:20,940
Okay, before heading to the forest, try taking out some field surveys or optional quests to collect materials.

3377
03:00:20,940 --> 03:00:22,900
They'll be ready for everything.

3378
03:00:23,720 --> 03:00:25,160
Hunt more efficiently by joining your friends.

3379
03:00:25,320 --> 03:00:28,260
When it affects the meal you had or off, be sure to use another.

3380
03:00:28,740 --> 03:00:30,400
Okay, so we gotta cook.

3381
03:00:31,260 --> 03:00:31,820
Good.

3382
03:00:34,860 --> 03:00:36,280
As they should be.

3383
03:00:37,480 --> 03:00:38,940
Okay, we gotta...

3384
03:00:39,800 --> 03:00:42,960
Okay, I wanna get a...

3385
03:00:42,960 --> 03:00:44,020
Where's Alma?

3386
03:00:45,080 --> 03:00:45,900
Where is Alma?

3387
03:00:47,620 --> 03:00:48,180
Alma?

3388
03:00:48,180 --> 03:00:48,680
Alma?

3389
03:00:49,660 --> 03:00:50,900
Where the fuck is Alma?

3390
03:00:54,460 --> 03:00:55,760
We did it, Garfield!

3391
03:00:55,900 --> 03:00:58,300
We successfully avoided responsibility.

3392
03:00:59,280 --> 03:01:00,520
Thank you for the super chat, NS.

3393
03:01:00,680 --> 03:01:01,700
Thank you, thank you.

3394
03:01:01,880 --> 03:01:02,800
Where the fuck is Alma?

3395
03:01:03,700 --> 03:01:04,420
By the tent?

3396
03:01:04,680 --> 03:01:05,500
That's not the...

3397
03:01:05,500 --> 03:01:06,340
Oh wait, that's her.

3398
03:01:06,580 --> 03:01:06,840
Whoops.

3399
03:01:08,060 --> 03:01:09,860
I couldn't realize that was her.

3400
03:01:10,700 --> 03:01:12,540
Okay, post-join quest.

3401
03:01:13,140 --> 03:01:14,300
Where's my optional ones?

3402
03:01:14,340 --> 03:01:15,860
My optional ones are already done, though.

3403
03:01:15,860 --> 03:01:18,720
Do I have to hunt them again?

3404
03:01:20,340 --> 03:01:21,640
Wait, can I... Oh!

3405
03:01:21,940 --> 03:01:23,460
I can hunt them again!

3406
03:01:23,740 --> 03:01:24,460
I see.

3407
03:01:25,180 --> 03:01:25,560
Alright.

3408
03:01:25,780 --> 03:01:26,840
Let's do this again.

3409
03:01:29,700 --> 03:01:31,300
What's the lucky voucher?

3410
03:01:32,200 --> 03:01:33,420
Okay, accept and prep.

3411
03:01:36,380 --> 03:01:36,780
Oh!

3412
03:01:38,940 --> 03:01:40,300
Alright, guys.

3413
03:01:41,040 --> 03:01:42,760
I need one other member.

3414
03:01:43,940 --> 03:01:48,700
One brave soul to help me hunt this guy.

3415
03:01:49,960 --> 03:01:52,600
I like how everybody starts surrounding Alma.

3416
03:01:53,260 --> 03:01:54,020
Me!

3417
03:01:54,220 --> 03:01:54,800
BigBang!

3418
03:01:55,140 --> 03:01:55,700
BigBang!

3419
03:01:59,140 --> 03:02:01,120
Urb was the lucky guy.

3420
03:02:03,820 --> 03:02:06,500
I like how everybody's surrounded her.

3421
03:02:06,580 --> 03:02:07,060
He's like, Me!

3422
03:02:07,480 --> 03:02:07,720
Me!

3423
03:02:10,380 --> 03:02:11,560
How do I...

3424
03:02:11,560 --> 03:02:13,040
How do I... Oh, you know.

3425
03:02:15,780 --> 03:02:17,040
The part now.

3426
03:02:22,320 --> 03:02:23,100
Oh, wait!

3427
03:02:23,420 --> 03:02:24,580
I forgot to check the cat.

3428
03:02:25,160 --> 03:02:25,960
Oh, you're right.

3429
03:02:26,180 --> 03:02:27,000
Cat inspection.

3430
03:02:29,260 --> 03:02:30,020
Oh, fuck.

3431
03:02:30,060 --> 03:02:30,460
I forgot.

3432
03:02:34,880 --> 03:02:36,660
Alright, next time, I'm checking your cat.

3433
03:02:37,780 --> 03:02:39,080
I swear to god.

3434
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:41,220
Okay, there you go.

3435
03:02:41,340 --> 03:02:42,380
Alright, Coco Bean.

3436
03:02:42,680 --> 03:02:43,540
There you go.

3437
03:02:45,460 --> 03:02:46,260
That's good.

3438
03:02:46,380 --> 03:02:48,720
Coco Bean is fully unclothed.

3439
03:02:49,800 --> 03:02:51,600
That's how we like it here.

3440
03:02:52,420 --> 03:02:53,780
Grab some herbs.

3441
03:02:54,920 --> 03:02:55,780
Wait, where is he?

3442
03:02:56,080 --> 03:02:57,780
Where's the...

3443
03:02:58,660 --> 03:02:59,220
Oh!

3444
03:03:00,200 --> 03:03:01,420
There's no fall damage.

3445
03:03:01,580 --> 03:03:02,820
I can literally do that.

3446
03:03:03,860 --> 03:03:04,540
Alright, let's go!

3447
03:03:08,790 --> 03:03:12,210
If I hook at boulders to make the... Wait, you can do that?

3448
03:03:12,750 --> 03:03:13,970
How do you do that?

3449
03:03:14,030 --> 03:03:14,650
Like this?

3450
03:03:15,390 --> 03:03:15,870
Oh!

3451
03:03:15,990 --> 03:03:16,970
Wait, that's so cool!

3452
03:03:19,810 --> 03:03:21,330
I don't know we can do that.

3453
03:03:22,810 --> 03:03:23,910
Wait, there he is!

3454
03:03:24,030 --> 03:03:24,790
There he is!

3455
03:03:26,170 --> 03:03:27,810
Wait, what's Alma doing here?

3456
03:03:31,770 --> 03:03:33,470
Wait, what's Alma doing here?

3457
03:03:37,880 --> 03:03:38,360
Hello?

3458
03:03:38,500 --> 03:03:38,760
Alma?

3459
03:03:39,880 --> 03:03:41,360
What's Alma doing here?

3460
03:03:44,520 --> 03:03:46,260
Yeah, but why is she here?

3461
03:03:48,320 --> 03:03:48,900
Alright!

3462
03:03:49,440 --> 03:03:50,240
Go do your thing!

3463
03:03:51,400 --> 03:03:51,820
Herb!

3464
03:03:52,240 --> 03:03:52,880
Shoot him!

3465
03:03:56,030 --> 03:03:56,670
Oh!

3466
03:03:56,810 --> 03:03:58,610
You can cancel your quest!

3467
03:03:59,070 --> 03:03:59,890
Wait, where's Herb?

3468
03:04:01,390 --> 03:04:02,390
Wait, where is he?

3469
03:04:05,230 --> 03:04:06,610
Wait, where the fuck is he?

3470
03:04:07,390 --> 03:04:08,990
Wait, where did he go?

3471
03:04:10,530 --> 03:04:12,750
Where did Herb go?

3472
03:04:12,750 --> 03:04:14,570
Where did...

3473
03:04:19,020 --> 03:04:20,100
Oh shit!

3474
03:04:20,180 --> 03:04:20,820
There he is!

3475
03:04:21,240 --> 03:04:21,540
Oh!

3476
03:04:24,740 --> 03:04:25,420
Sorry!

3477
03:04:25,700 --> 03:04:28,480
I didn't realize you were fighting him already.

3478
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,380
Alright, don't worry Herb, I'm right here.

3479
03:04:31,980 --> 03:04:33,120
I'm helping.

3480
03:04:33,920 --> 03:04:34,820
I'm helping.

3481
03:04:35,480 --> 03:04:36,580
Don't worry.

3482
03:04:36,800 --> 03:04:37,400
Agro him!

3483
03:04:37,500 --> 03:04:38,560
Agro him, Herb!

3484
03:04:40,220 --> 03:04:41,380
Do your thing!

3485
03:04:42,760 --> 03:04:45,040
Sorry I missed, but do your thing!

3486
03:04:47,600 --> 03:04:49,520
Don't worry, I got you!

3487
03:04:49,960 --> 03:04:53,080
I missed, but I got you!

3488
03:04:53,460 --> 03:04:54,240
Do your thing!

3489
03:04:55,720 --> 03:04:58,020
God, oh god, oh god!

3490
03:04:58,160 --> 03:04:58,920
Perfect dodge!

3491
03:05:01,060 --> 03:05:01,740
Nice!

3492
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:02,860
Perfect dodge!

3493
03:05:04,020 --> 03:05:05,640
Hey, I'm okay though, Herb.

3494
03:05:06,580 --> 03:05:08,120
That's all that matters.

3495
03:05:09,840 --> 03:05:11,440
Herb, keep doing your thing!

3496
03:05:12,520 --> 03:05:13,420
Good, Herb!

3497
03:05:16,340 --> 03:05:17,200
Oh shit!

3498
03:05:17,880 --> 03:05:18,520
Oh shit!

3499
03:05:21,040 --> 03:05:21,560
Nice!

3500
03:05:23,220 --> 03:05:24,800
Don't worry, I'm doing it!

3501
03:05:25,100 --> 03:05:26,360
Garfield's doing it too!

3502
03:05:33,130 --> 03:05:34,330
Okay, okay!

3503
03:05:35,170 --> 03:05:37,070
Okay, we can't have him get close to me!

3504
03:05:37,110 --> 03:05:38,870
Herb, you're supposed to aggro him, Herb!

3505
03:05:41,670 --> 03:05:42,270
Herb!

3506
03:05:42,350 --> 03:05:43,070
Herb, you're supposed to...

3507
03:05:43,070 --> 03:05:44,910
You're supposed to aggro him!

3508
03:05:45,590 --> 03:05:46,790
What are you doing?

3509
03:05:48,630 --> 03:05:49,230
Nice!

3510
03:05:50,930 --> 03:05:51,890
Okay, nice!

3511
03:05:52,710 --> 03:05:53,950
I got this!

3512
03:05:56,910 --> 03:05:58,490
I'm just gonna keep doing this.

3513
03:05:59,130 --> 03:06:00,910
If you keep aggroing him, I can do this!

3514
03:06:01,170 --> 03:06:01,670
All day!

3515
03:06:01,830 --> 03:06:03,130
Oh, never mind!

3516
03:06:04,350 --> 03:06:04,870
Okay!

3517
03:06:05,990 --> 03:06:08,710
God, I'm so good at video games!

3518
03:06:09,070 --> 03:06:09,530
Woo!

3519
03:06:10,370 --> 03:06:11,510
Okay, I have my stamina.

3520
03:06:11,790 --> 03:06:12,770
He needs to rebuild though.

3521
03:06:14,410 --> 03:06:15,170
Herb, Herb, Herb!

3522
03:06:15,190 --> 03:06:16,630
What is he doing?!

3523
03:06:20,770 --> 03:06:22,110
Get out of here!

3524
03:06:24,830 --> 03:06:26,170
Oh wait, he has wounds!

3525
03:06:27,470 --> 03:06:27,990
Nice!

3526
03:06:29,390 --> 03:06:29,910
Nice!

3527
03:06:29,910 --> 03:06:30,070
Nice!

3528
03:06:31,640 --> 03:06:32,570
I got the wound!

3529
03:06:35,850 --> 03:06:37,230
Shut the fuck up, Alma!

3530
03:06:37,330 --> 03:06:38,530
I'm fucking fighting him!

3531
03:06:39,190 --> 03:06:43,030
Alright, let's go!

3532
03:06:43,870 --> 03:06:46,210
Alma, I have important things to do!

3533
03:06:49,770 --> 03:06:50,350
Okay.

3534
03:06:52,690 --> 03:06:53,270
Uh...

3535
03:06:53,270 --> 03:06:53,570
Yeah.

3536
03:06:55,110 --> 03:06:56,250
Nice, I got it!

3537
03:06:57,670 --> 03:06:58,790
Oh, no!

3538
03:07:01,410 --> 03:07:02,450
He touched me.

3539
03:07:02,550 --> 03:07:03,670
My perfect score.

3540
03:07:05,410 --> 03:07:06,210
Why, Root?

3541
03:07:06,330 --> 03:07:08,050
Because I'm trying to fucking fight!

3542
03:07:08,710 --> 03:07:10,750
You don't just interrupt the fucking fight!

3543
03:07:10,750 --> 03:07:15,400
Oh my god, why are you looking at me?!

3544
03:07:15,400 --> 03:07:15,880
Okay.

3545
03:07:16,300 --> 03:07:17,120
Oh, shit.

3546
03:07:17,220 --> 03:07:18,720
Oh, okay, I did that.

3547
03:07:21,400 --> 03:07:22,320
Okay, nice.

3548
03:07:23,860 --> 03:07:24,240
Woo!

3549
03:07:26,040 --> 03:07:26,920
Watch this.

3550
03:07:28,600 --> 03:07:29,360
Woo!

3551
03:07:30,760 --> 03:07:32,480
Oh my god, 24?!

3552
03:07:33,080 --> 03:07:33,880
That's me!

3553
03:07:34,880 --> 03:07:36,340
Okay, nice.

3554
03:07:37,700 --> 03:07:38,460
Nice.

3555
03:07:38,940 --> 03:07:39,160
Oh!

3556
03:07:39,800 --> 03:07:40,100
Oh,

3557
03:07:50,800 --> 03:07:51,000
shit.

3558
03:07:54,460 --> 03:07:55,980
Some say I'm a gamer!

3559
03:07:57,720 --> 03:08:00,180
Oh my god, another perfect dodge!

3560
03:08:00,560 --> 03:08:01,380
Look at that!

3561
03:08:02,220 --> 03:08:03,680
Yeah, I'm gonna...

3562
03:08:03,680 --> 03:08:04,040
Woo!

3563
03:08:05,480 --> 03:08:06,060
Nice.

3564
03:08:06,060 --> 03:08:07,600
Now do another fire.

3565
03:08:10,500 --> 03:08:10,960
Nice.

3566
03:08:11,400 --> 03:08:12,500
He has no wounds, though.

3567
03:08:13,660 --> 03:08:14,520
Oh, wait, no, he does!

3568
03:08:16,640 --> 03:08:19,380
Oh, he's, like, limping, so I can't...

3569
03:08:19,380 --> 03:08:21,160
Okay, I need to carve this real fast.

3570
03:08:24,440 --> 03:08:25,360
Okay, um...

3571
03:08:25,360 --> 03:08:27,220
That guy's a bad guy, right?

3572
03:08:27,500 --> 03:08:28,460
It'll be fine.

3573
03:08:28,920 --> 03:08:30,080
I'm gonna carve this, though.

3574
03:08:32,920 --> 03:08:33,960
Alright, I'm heading over.

3575
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:38,300
Alright.

3576
03:08:38,720 --> 03:08:39,600
Oh, he's gonna sleep!

3577
03:08:40,320 --> 03:08:41,060
He's gonna sleep!

3578
03:08:42,940 --> 03:08:44,100
Wait, are they gonna fight each other?

3579
03:08:44,160 --> 03:08:46,060
If they fight each other, do I get the win?

3580
03:08:46,460 --> 03:08:47,300
On the quest?

3581
03:08:51,850 --> 03:08:53,110
Oh, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no!

3582
03:08:53,230 --> 03:08:53,850
Wait, wait, wait!

3583
03:08:59,120 --> 03:08:59,420
Nice.

3584
03:09:01,060 --> 03:09:02,180
That's how I like it.

3585
03:09:03,100 --> 03:09:05,440
Oh, they do?!

3586
03:09:07,500 --> 03:09:08,420
Oh, I didn't kill him.

3587
03:09:08,420 --> 03:09:09,160
I thought I did.

3588
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:11,560
Pew!

3589
03:09:14,540 --> 03:09:15,100
Pew!

3590
03:09:17,180 --> 03:09:18,020
Oh, shit.

3591
03:09:18,940 --> 03:09:19,440
Nice.

3592
03:09:20,500 --> 03:09:21,060
Okay.

3593
03:09:22,040 --> 03:09:22,700
Got it.

3594
03:09:24,620 --> 03:09:25,180
Nice.

3595
03:09:25,360 --> 03:09:26,380
I got the winning blow!

3596
03:09:31,870 --> 03:09:32,430
Yeah!

3597
03:09:35,830 --> 03:09:36,390
Nice.

3598
03:09:36,650 --> 03:09:37,990
I got the winning blow, guys.

3599
03:09:38,070 --> 03:09:38,830
I did that.

3600
03:09:40,250 --> 03:09:40,950
That's right.

3601
03:09:41,030 --> 03:09:42,270
I carried her.

3602
03:09:44,590 --> 03:09:45,690
I carried.

3603
03:09:46,010 --> 03:09:47,850
I'm so good with a bow, guys.

3604
03:09:47,990 --> 03:09:49,810
Wait, the bow is actually so fucking easy.

3605
03:09:49,950 --> 03:09:50,430
I'm not gonna lie.

3606
03:09:51,930 --> 03:09:55,310
The bow is actually so easy.

3607
03:09:57,730 --> 03:09:58,690
I don't know.

3608
03:09:59,450 --> 03:10:01,150
I didn't know weapon is pretty easy.

3609
03:10:02,730 --> 03:10:04,670
I do it a lot!

3610
03:10:05,790 --> 03:10:06,830
What do you mean?!

3611
03:10:06,830 --> 03:10:08,990
The first...

3612
03:10:08,990 --> 03:10:10,830
The first monster I hunted...

3613
03:10:10,830 --> 03:10:13,110
The first monster I hunted...

3614
03:10:13,110 --> 03:10:14,930
I did it with a bow alone.

3615
03:10:18,600 --> 03:10:21,150
Solo the entire game.

3616
03:10:22,570 --> 03:10:25,930
I just wanna help my fellow dragoons, guys.

3617
03:10:26,410 --> 03:10:28,250
I was just helping them out.

3618
03:10:33,420 --> 03:10:34,840
Guys, guys.

3619
03:10:35,920 --> 03:10:39,080
I just feel so bad for my dragoons.

3620
03:10:39,080 --> 03:10:40,280
I don't know.

3621
03:10:40,380 --> 03:10:43,140
I just felt like a good heart to help them out.

3622
03:10:43,860 --> 03:10:46,240
Let them have an easier time.

3623
03:10:46,980 --> 03:10:48,360
Look at that.

3624
03:10:48,700 --> 03:10:50,480
I broke two parts, guys.

3625
03:10:50,660 --> 03:10:51,320
That was me.

3626
03:10:51,460 --> 03:10:52,280
I did that.

3627
03:10:56,690 --> 03:10:58,390
Wait, there's more combos?

3628
03:10:58,790 --> 03:10:59,950
Other than dragon...

3629
03:11:01,430 --> 03:11:02,590
That's all I've been doing.

3630
03:11:02,730 --> 03:11:04,230
I've just been doing dragon piercer.

3631
03:11:04,870 --> 03:11:06,050
I was like, wait.

3632
03:11:06,430 --> 03:11:07,470
There's more?

3633
03:11:07,470 --> 03:11:10,930
There's more to life than dragon piercer?

3634
03:11:11,150 --> 03:11:12,230
Let's put the dual blades.

3635
03:11:12,290 --> 03:11:14,010
How do I swap my weapons, though?

3636
03:11:20,030 --> 03:11:20,650
Okay.

3637
03:11:21,030 --> 03:11:21,890
Hope daggers.

3638
03:11:22,230 --> 03:11:23,750
But how do I swap it?

3639
03:11:28,900 --> 03:11:30,660
I wanna swap my...

3640
03:11:31,880 --> 03:11:33,640
Oh, X on the mount.

3641
03:11:33,780 --> 03:11:34,080
Okay.

3642
03:11:34,080 --> 03:11:34,600
Okay.

3643
03:11:37,340 --> 03:11:37,720
Alma.

3644
03:11:41,260 --> 03:11:43,120
Oh, I have to do it on the bird.

3645
03:11:43,280 --> 03:11:44,300
Oh, okay.

3646
03:11:45,820 --> 03:11:47,420
Okay, so I did the optional quest.

3647
03:11:47,700 --> 03:11:49,320
I think we progressed it now.

3648
03:11:50,400 --> 03:11:52,700
I feel like we don't need to worry about anything else.

3649
03:11:53,360 --> 03:11:54,780
Let's see if there's anything I can upgrade.

3650
03:11:55,840 --> 03:11:57,100
Will you dress dad in a hot dog?

3651
03:11:57,100 --> 03:11:58,880
I actually have a hot dog costume.

3652
03:11:59,720 --> 03:12:02,820
I bought it for his second Halloween.

3653
03:12:02,820 --> 03:12:04,760
I bought a hot dog costume.

3654
03:12:07,860 --> 03:12:09,840
Do I have upgrades for it?

3655
03:12:11,720 --> 03:12:12,240
No.

3656
03:12:12,420 --> 03:12:13,760
I don't know what to find.

3657
03:12:14,720 --> 03:12:16,940
Can I upgrade my armor?

3658
03:12:18,020 --> 03:12:19,080
Oh, I can.

3659
03:12:20,140 --> 03:12:21,800
I need the...

3660
03:12:21,800 --> 03:12:23,660
Is this the one I killed?

3661
03:12:24,340 --> 03:12:25,140
Is it stronger?

3662
03:12:26,360 --> 03:12:27,600
No, it's the same.

3663
03:12:28,800 --> 03:12:30,120
Oh no, this is stronger.

3664
03:12:36,970 --> 03:12:37,170
Okay.

3665
03:12:38,270 --> 03:12:39,670
I like this more.

3666
03:12:40,910 --> 03:12:42,430
I have enough for this.

3667
03:12:45,710 --> 03:12:47,590
Wait, I do have this too.

3668
03:12:47,770 --> 03:12:49,270
But they're weaker though.

3669
03:12:50,550 --> 03:12:51,810
Yeah, all of these are weaker.

3670
03:12:53,150 --> 03:12:54,210
I'll get this first.

3671
03:12:58,960 --> 03:13:02,740
Yeah, equip it.

3672
03:13:04,380 --> 03:13:05,500
Wait, what are the shoes?

3673
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:10,520
I need this more.

3674
03:13:15,100 --> 03:13:15,740
Nice.

3675
03:13:16,740 --> 03:13:18,960
Do I have any of my upgrades yet?

3676
03:13:21,780 --> 03:13:23,000
Oh no, not like bowgun.

3677
03:13:23,120 --> 03:13:23,400
Bow.

3678
03:13:26,040 --> 03:13:26,940
The bone...

3679
03:13:26,940 --> 03:13:28,020
Oh, I do!

3680
03:13:30,160 --> 03:13:31,600
I have the bone tree.

3681
03:13:32,100 --> 03:13:33,740
Wait, the attack is better.

3682
03:13:34,880 --> 03:13:35,860
I have the bone.

3683
03:13:38,060 --> 03:13:39,420
Wait, attack...

3684
03:13:39,420 --> 03:13:40,060
130.

3685
03:13:41,480 --> 03:13:42,460
Thanks for the carry, Doki.

3686
03:13:42,740 --> 03:13:44,320
Yeah, I don't know how I did it.

3687
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:47,180
I don't know how I did it.

3688
03:13:47,300 --> 03:13:48,200
But that was pretty cool.

3689
03:13:48,880 --> 03:13:50,600
Oh, is this a fire bow?

3690
03:13:52,940 --> 03:13:53,860
Is it this?

3691
03:13:55,640 --> 03:13:56,860
Is this a fire bow?

3692
03:14:02,070 --> 03:14:02,990
Okay, let's try it.

3693
03:14:03,030 --> 03:14:03,930
I want to try the fire.

3694
03:14:06,950 --> 03:14:07,910
Oh, look at that.

3695
03:14:09,070 --> 03:14:10,090
That's my bow.

3696
03:14:10,770 --> 03:14:13,170
Okay, I'll get the primary for this.

3697
03:14:14,690 --> 03:14:15,950
Oh, now I know.

3698
03:14:16,090 --> 03:14:18,090
Now I know why you guys were like...

3699
03:14:20,110 --> 03:14:21,370
Use two bows.

3700
03:14:21,690 --> 03:14:24,070
Oh, that makes so much more sense now.

3701
03:14:24,410 --> 03:14:25,050
I was confused.

3702
03:14:25,190 --> 03:14:26,710
I was like, what the fuck do you mean, use two bows?

3703
03:14:28,350 --> 03:14:30,730
I was like, what the fuck do you mean?

3704
03:14:33,350 --> 03:14:36,230
Should I use normal daggers or fire?

3705
03:14:36,430 --> 03:14:38,070
You know I fucking fire daggers.

3706
03:14:40,570 --> 03:14:41,730
Or should I do normal?

3707
03:14:41,930 --> 03:14:43,570
Just in case, like...

3708
03:14:49,860 --> 03:14:51,200
I don't know.

3709
03:14:52,020 --> 03:14:53,580
We'll do fire daggers for now.

3710
03:14:54,060 --> 03:14:56,740
Because I have enough equipment materials for it.

3711
03:15:02,220 --> 03:15:03,940
Alright, next fight we'll use daggers.

3712
03:15:05,980 --> 03:15:07,020
Secondary, okay.

3713
03:15:09,500 --> 03:15:10,840
Oh shit, you're right, I should give him...

3714
03:15:10,840 --> 03:15:12,560
Let me see if I can...

3715
03:15:12,560 --> 03:15:14,980
I forgot to see if I have a pal...

3716
03:15:14,980 --> 03:15:15,540
Goddammit!

3717
03:15:16,060 --> 03:15:16,980
Sorry, Palico.

3718
03:15:20,800 --> 03:15:21,960
I forgot about you.

3719
03:15:22,280 --> 03:15:24,240
Oh, sorry, I already used all my...

3720
03:15:24,240 --> 03:15:25,860
I already used all my items.

3721
03:15:28,780 --> 03:15:30,960
Oh, so that's how he has all these.

3722
03:15:31,800 --> 03:15:32,740
Wait, is this stronger?

3723
03:15:32,740 --> 03:15:32,900
Is this stronger?

3724
03:15:40,520 --> 03:15:42,520
That's the same.

3725
03:15:43,260 --> 03:15:45,640
I don't know what range though.

3726
03:15:46,880 --> 03:15:47,600
Severing?

3727
03:15:48,360 --> 03:15:49,220
Nah.

3728
03:15:51,960 --> 03:15:53,040
You're keeping the hammer.

3729
03:15:54,220 --> 03:15:54,640
It's alright.

3730
03:15:55,180 --> 03:15:58,420
Why does this cat have clothes?

3731
03:16:01,200 --> 03:16:01,640
Loki?

3732
03:16:04,020 --> 03:16:04,460
Loki?

3733
03:16:07,220 --> 03:16:08,860
I know that cat's your cat.

3734
03:16:10,380 --> 03:16:11,820
I know that's your cat.

3735
03:16:12,100 --> 03:16:13,320
Why does he have clothes?

3736
03:16:13,700 --> 03:16:15,380
Why does your cat have clothes?

3737
03:16:16,080 --> 03:16:16,420
Huh?

3738
03:16:17,660 --> 03:16:19,020
I know he's your cat.

3739
03:16:19,820 --> 03:16:21,340
Don't pretend I don't know.

3740
03:16:22,960 --> 03:16:24,120
Take his clothes off right now.

3741
03:16:24,220 --> 03:16:24,780
Go to the tent.

3742
03:16:25,740 --> 03:16:27,800
Go to the tent and take his clothes off right now.

3743
03:16:32,280 --> 03:16:37,900
Go to the tent and take your cat's clothes off right now.

3744
03:16:38,640 --> 03:16:56,320
Go to the tent and take your cat's clothes off right now.

3745
03:16:56,320 --> 03:16:57,500
Go to the tent and take your cat's clothes off right now.

3746
03:16:57,760 --> 03:16:57,780
Go to the tent and take your cat's clothes off right now.

3747
03:16:59,160 --> 03:17:00,660
I'll wait here.

3748
03:17:00,980 --> 03:17:02,720
I'm gonna wait here.

3749
03:17:07,410 --> 03:17:09,280
I can wait.

3750
03:17:16,180 --> 03:17:19,720
Guys, we have one rule in this guild, guys.

3751
03:17:20,360 --> 03:17:22,340
We have one single rule.

3752
03:17:23,550 --> 03:17:25,900
Your cat must not wear clothes.

3753
03:17:26,700 --> 03:17:29,840
I literally have one rule to join this guild.

3754
03:17:34,860 --> 03:17:35,600
Shame.

3755
03:17:36,520 --> 03:17:37,800
That's right.

3756
03:17:38,160 --> 03:17:38,900
Good!

3757
03:17:39,120 --> 03:17:40,860
Oh my god, he's so naked.

3758
03:17:42,400 --> 03:17:44,420
Oh my god, look at him.

3759
03:17:44,720 --> 03:17:47,020
He's just... he's just bare.

3760
03:17:51,180 --> 03:17:52,400
That's good.

3761
03:17:53,520 --> 03:17:56,220
That's how we like it here in this guild.

3762
03:18:00,880 --> 03:18:03,400
That's how we like it here.

3763
03:18:06,060 --> 03:18:08,680
Oh shit, I keep pressing right click and I don't know why.

3764
03:18:10,200 --> 03:18:11,460
I wanna see my other guild.

3765
03:18:12,240 --> 03:18:14,760
I like how Dragoon 2 just only has 19.

3766
03:18:14,860 --> 03:18:17,400
Everybody wants to be in the Dragoons 1.

3767
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:19,440
Alright.

3768
03:18:20,260 --> 03:18:23,480
All I'm saying is that...

3769
03:18:24,520 --> 03:18:32,840
Is that if I see any cat with clothes in Dragoons, I'm demoting you to Dragoon 2.

3770
03:18:35,500 --> 03:18:40,780
Just know, just know that if I see clothes on...

3771
03:18:41,400 --> 03:18:43,060
What the fuck you already...

3772
03:18:43,060 --> 03:18:49,420
If I see clothes on your Dragoon squad, you're getting demoted to Dragoon 2.

3773
03:18:49,440 --> 03:18:50,140
Wait.

3774
03:18:51,640 --> 03:18:52,680
Alright.

3775
03:18:53,420 --> 03:18:54,880
Let's pick a random goon.

3776
03:18:55,520 --> 03:18:56,920
Okay, Codeman.

3777
03:19:01,480 --> 03:19:03,700
Oh, Codeman.

3778
03:19:08,760 --> 03:19:09,800
Codeman.

3779
03:19:11,440 --> 03:19:14,380
Guess who's getting demoted.

3780
03:19:16,220 --> 03:19:19,840
Is that a shirt and hat I see?

3781
03:19:22,340 --> 03:19:25,780
Oh, that's a shirt and hat.

3782
03:19:27,580 --> 03:19:28,460
Cut.

3783
03:19:29,100 --> 03:19:29,960
Alright.

3784
03:19:30,580 --> 03:19:31,900
Alright, Codeman.

3785
03:19:33,180 --> 03:19:33,800
Alright.

3786
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:38,300
Time to join Dragoons 2.

3787
03:19:41,340 --> 03:19:45,180
And before he's not even watching, he's just like, wait, why did I get kicked out?

3788
03:19:48,520 --> 03:19:49,960
That's right.

3789
03:19:51,720 --> 03:19:52,680
No hats.

3790
03:19:53,060 --> 03:19:54,240
No hats.

3791
03:19:57,800 --> 03:19:58,760
That's right.

3792
03:19:59,340 --> 03:20:00,580
I think that's just a hunter card.

3793
03:20:00,740 --> 03:20:02,700
No, because if I look...

3794
03:20:02,700 --> 03:20:04,840
If I look at my...

3795
03:20:04,840 --> 03:20:06,080
Wait, how do I look at my own profile?

3796
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:08,860
Okay, if I look at...

3797
03:20:08,860 --> 03:20:11,220
Okay, I know one person doesn't have clothes on.

3798
03:20:11,660 --> 03:20:12,240
Who is it?

3799
03:20:12,340 --> 03:20:13,480
It was...

3800
03:20:14,900 --> 03:20:16,980
Okay, Lily Rose doesn't have clothes on.

3801
03:20:17,200 --> 03:20:18,220
I know that.

3802
03:20:18,680 --> 03:20:19,220
Look, see?

3803
03:20:19,620 --> 03:20:20,180
Look at that.

3804
03:20:20,180 --> 03:20:21,940
Lily Rose knows the assignment.

3805
03:20:22,460 --> 03:20:24,920
Give him a second chance.

3806
03:20:24,980 --> 03:20:25,360
Alright.

3807
03:20:27,140 --> 03:20:27,780
Alright.

3808
03:20:28,120 --> 03:20:28,540
Codeman.

3809
03:20:28,760 --> 03:20:29,560
Oh, Codeman.

3810
03:20:30,520 --> 03:20:30,880
Yeah?

3811
03:20:31,840 --> 03:20:33,860
You're still here, Codeman.

3812
03:20:34,420 --> 03:20:36,020
Did you take off the clothes off?

3813
03:20:36,900 --> 03:20:38,260
He's like, no.

3814
03:20:38,420 --> 03:20:39,440
No, don't.

3815
03:20:39,700 --> 03:20:40,640
He's like, no.

3816
03:20:41,500 --> 03:20:42,720
Don't, please.

3817
03:20:42,860 --> 03:20:43,640
Let me stay.

3818
03:20:45,380 --> 03:20:47,720
Let me stay, please.

3819
03:20:48,340 --> 03:20:49,260
Alright, where's your cat?

3820
03:20:53,840 --> 03:20:55,180
Is it Canoli?

3821
03:20:55,660 --> 03:20:57,020
Did you strip your cat?

3822
03:20:57,600 --> 03:20:57,920
Alright.

3823
03:21:00,060 --> 03:21:01,240
Let's check.

3824
03:21:01,440 --> 03:21:02,980
Let's check in Codeman.

3825
03:21:03,900 --> 03:21:06,080
Don't kick me out, please.

3826
03:21:06,540 --> 03:21:07,440
I'll not strip.

3827
03:21:07,660 --> 03:21:09,240
I'll take his clothes off.

3828
03:21:11,980 --> 03:21:12,820
Alright.

3829
03:21:14,220 --> 03:21:15,460
Let's see.

3830
03:21:16,160 --> 03:21:16,800
Codeman!

3831
03:21:17,920 --> 03:21:21,120
Your cat is still wearing clothes, Codeman!

3832
03:21:24,020 --> 03:21:24,540
Codeman.

3833
03:21:31,160 --> 03:21:32,200
Canoli, my...

3834
03:21:32,200 --> 03:21:33,860
Wait, can you actually change your profile?

3835
03:21:34,020 --> 03:21:35,320
Wait, how do you change your, like...

3836
03:21:36,860 --> 03:21:39,220
Wait, is it cause, like, your Hunter profile?

3837
03:21:40,420 --> 03:21:41,340
Hunter profile.

3838
03:21:41,960 --> 03:21:42,520
Yeah, see?

3839
03:21:42,960 --> 03:21:44,560
He's not wearing clothes.

3840
03:21:46,240 --> 03:21:47,880
Oh, his card not updated.

3841
03:21:48,560 --> 03:21:49,020
Alright.

3842
03:21:49,800 --> 03:21:50,840
I saw Canoli.

3843
03:21:51,600 --> 03:21:53,060
You know what, Codeman?

3844
03:21:53,060 --> 03:21:53,920
You got...

3845
03:21:54,660 --> 03:21:57,240
Canoli was saved today, Codeman.

3846
03:21:57,460 --> 03:21:59,300
Because you showed me your cat.

3847
03:22:02,320 --> 03:22:02,940
Okay.

3848
03:22:04,640 --> 03:22:06,000
Okay, let's check.

3849
03:22:07,080 --> 03:22:07,880
He's like, please.

3850
03:22:08,020 --> 03:22:09,340
This is my life now.

3851
03:22:10,060 --> 03:22:14,100
I know you made the squad two hours ago, but this is my life.

3852
03:22:14,200 --> 03:22:14,640
Please.

3853
03:22:14,640 --> 03:22:16,680
I'm here to help anytime.

3854
03:22:21,320 --> 03:22:23,680
Please don't kick me out.

3855
03:22:27,880 --> 03:22:29,820
Look how happy he is!

3856
03:22:33,310 --> 03:22:34,670
He's so happy.

3857
03:22:34,930 --> 03:22:35,450
Look at that.

3858
03:22:35,590 --> 03:22:37,650
See, Canoli is so much happier.

3859
03:22:38,310 --> 03:22:41,010
He even removed his hat.

3860
03:22:51,500 --> 03:22:52,940
You guys are lucky.

3861
03:22:54,000 --> 03:22:55,680
You guys are lucky.

3862
03:22:57,600 --> 03:22:59,480
Oh my god, there he is!

3863
03:23:00,300 --> 03:23:01,380
There he is!

3864
03:23:01,420 --> 03:23:02,500
That's level 100!

3865
03:23:03,400 --> 03:23:05,340
Oh my god, it's him!

3866
03:23:06,140 --> 03:23:09,920
It's the legendary level 100 Hunter break!

3867
03:23:14,440 --> 03:23:15,840
Where's his naked cat?

3868
03:23:16,340 --> 03:23:17,360
Which one is his cat?

3869
03:23:18,240 --> 03:23:19,780
I don't know which one it is.

3870
03:23:19,960 --> 03:23:22,220
He had a fucking ghost as a cat.

3871
03:23:24,460 --> 03:23:25,540
It's him!

3872
03:23:25,940 --> 03:23:28,560
The legendary level fucking 100!

3873
03:23:30,360 --> 03:23:31,600
Okay, head towards the forest.

3874
03:23:31,760 --> 03:23:32,500
How the fuck?

3875
03:23:32,640 --> 03:23:33,540
Where is the forest?

3876
03:23:34,280 --> 03:23:35,300
Oh, it's this way.

3877
03:23:41,280 --> 03:23:43,340
How do I go to the forest?

3878
03:23:45,540 --> 03:23:46,040
Wait.

3879
03:23:46,900 --> 03:23:48,360
Am I going the right way?

3880
03:23:50,400 --> 03:23:52,620
I don't know where the forest is.

3881
03:23:55,640 --> 03:23:57,240
Guys, where's the forest?

3882
03:23:58,660 --> 03:24:00,540
Is it this way?

3883
03:24:05,270 --> 03:24:06,970
Where is the forest?

3884
03:24:10,640 --> 03:24:11,520
Oh, auto move?

3885
03:24:11,620 --> 03:24:12,820
Am I auto move right now?

3886
03:24:13,300 --> 03:24:14,160
I can't tell.

3887
03:24:17,420 --> 03:24:18,020
Wait.

3888
03:24:18,400 --> 03:24:20,220
How do I do auto move?

3889
03:24:22,500 --> 03:24:23,720
Am I auto moving?

3890
03:24:28,420 --> 03:24:29,300
There's a map.

3891
03:24:30,760 --> 03:24:33,240
Where the fuck is the forest?

3892
03:24:34,320 --> 03:24:36,300
Is this the riverside trail?

3893
03:24:37,380 --> 03:24:39,940
What the fuck am I looking at?

3894
03:24:44,040 --> 03:24:45,620
I don't know where I'm going.

3895
03:24:50,540 --> 03:24:52,220
Oh, it's right here.

3896
03:24:52,500 --> 03:24:52,940
Okay.

3897
03:24:55,480 --> 03:24:56,320
Okay, go.

3898
03:24:57,580 --> 03:24:59,080
Take me to the forest.

3899
03:25:01,900 --> 03:25:03,400
Okay, I think I'm heading...

3900
03:25:03,400 --> 03:25:04,320
Yeah, I'm heading to the forest.

3901
03:25:04,340 --> 03:25:05,200
Alright, go.

3902
03:25:09,080 --> 03:25:11,140
Look, I'm just very confused.

3903
03:25:16,770 --> 03:25:17,610
Woah.

3904
03:25:18,490 --> 03:25:19,870
Wait, I can't go across.

3905
03:25:21,670 --> 03:25:23,370
Where do I go across?

3906
03:25:29,140 --> 03:25:30,500
Am I going the...

3907
03:25:30,500 --> 03:25:30,800
What?

3908
03:25:35,070 --> 03:25:35,910
What?

3909
03:25:37,550 --> 03:25:39,310
I'm so confused, Alma.

3910
03:25:40,170 --> 03:25:41,330
Why is my auto...

3911
03:25:41,330 --> 03:25:43,150
My auto thing isn't working.

3912
03:25:47,590 --> 03:25:49,970
How's my auto movement not working?

3913
03:25:55,470 --> 03:25:56,830
Is this the forest?

3914
03:26:00,280 --> 03:26:02,640
Oh, I have to mark it?

3915
03:26:03,340 --> 03:26:05,840
Oh my god, I thought it just does it.

3916
03:26:07,160 --> 03:26:08,400
Okay, give me a sec.

3917
03:26:08,680 --> 03:26:09,860
I'm very confused.

3918
03:26:12,380 --> 03:26:14,300
Okay, where's the forest?

3919
03:26:17,600 --> 03:26:18,240
Oh.

3920
03:26:21,130 --> 03:26:21,770
Okay.

3921
03:26:21,770 --> 03:26:22,770
Is this...

3922
03:26:24,330 --> 03:26:25,550
Are you in the forest?

3923
03:26:27,870 --> 03:26:29,210
Oh, that's the forest?

3924
03:26:31,270 --> 03:26:32,130
Oh, okay.

3925
03:26:35,050 --> 03:26:36,010
Alright, go.

3926
03:26:37,830 --> 03:26:39,150
Now it should auto.

3927
03:26:39,450 --> 03:26:40,830
I figured it out, guys.

3928
03:26:42,730 --> 03:26:44,710
I figured out how to use the auto.

3929
03:26:44,950 --> 03:26:45,910
I was so confused.

3930
03:26:46,050 --> 03:26:47,190
I was like...

3931
03:26:47,190 --> 03:26:49,970
I thought it would just automatically auto for me.

3932
03:26:54,280 --> 03:26:54,860
Okay.

3933
03:26:58,620 --> 03:26:59,760
Not gonna wait?

3934
03:27:00,240 --> 03:27:00,960
What the fuck?

3935
03:27:11,320 --> 03:27:13,600
I bet the forest is so big.

3936
03:27:13,660 --> 03:27:15,200
It's got trees coming out of trees.

3937
03:27:15,380 --> 03:27:16,220
Okay, Garfiel.

3938
03:27:18,000 --> 03:27:19,640
Trees coming out of trees.

3939
03:27:27,320 --> 03:27:28,660
Alright, I figured it out, guys.

3940
03:27:28,780 --> 03:27:29,680
I'm so smart.

3941
03:27:32,100 --> 03:27:33,180
Forest findings.

3942
03:27:33,340 --> 03:27:35,440
Oh my god, we're finally at chapter one.

3943
03:27:44,820 --> 03:27:45,940
I know!

3944
03:27:46,080 --> 03:27:47,640
I wish we could ride the dogs!

3945
03:27:48,160 --> 03:27:49,720
Now we have, like, birds.

3946
03:27:50,340 --> 03:27:52,480
Because you can customize your dog, right?

3947
03:27:53,080 --> 03:27:54,040
In the last game.

3948
03:27:55,540 --> 03:27:56,100
Noink.

3949
03:27:57,320 --> 03:27:58,680
I would've made dad.

3950
03:28:00,020 --> 03:28:01,200
I thought we'd get dogs.

3951
03:28:01,300 --> 03:28:02,680
That's why I, like, made Garfield.

3952
03:28:04,060 --> 03:28:06,740
That's the only reason why I made Garfield.

3953
03:28:06,860 --> 03:28:09,320
Because I was like, well, I would get a dog too, so I...

3954
03:28:25,860 --> 03:28:27,980
Oh my god, we're finally in forest land.

3955
03:28:28,580 --> 03:28:29,780
We made it, guys!

3956
03:28:30,540 --> 03:28:31,100
Yoink.

3957
03:28:32,240 --> 03:28:34,640
I love this mechanic.

3958
03:28:34,900 --> 03:28:35,760
It's so fun.

3959
03:28:37,140 --> 03:28:38,960
It makes looting so easy.

3960
03:28:44,980 --> 03:28:47,000
Oh my god, it's just like Sand Land.

3961
03:28:47,980 --> 03:28:49,760
Forest land is literally right next door.

3962
03:28:54,210 --> 03:28:56,590
Surprisingly, the game runs really well.

3963
03:28:57,490 --> 03:28:59,630
I honestly thought it was gonna, like...

3964
03:28:59,630 --> 03:29:02,050
Like my, you know, I was gonna lag and everything.

3965
03:29:02,210 --> 03:29:03,710
But it's actually running so well.

3966
03:29:27,220 --> 03:29:28,780
That's where all the water went.

3967
03:29:29,820 --> 03:29:31,040
The water is red?

3968
03:29:31,960 --> 03:29:32,520
The fuck?

3969
03:29:33,940 --> 03:29:35,260
Yeah, what's wrong with the water?

3970
03:29:52,870 --> 03:29:54,530
Oh, we set up a new camp.

3971
03:29:55,610 --> 03:29:57,250
Are we not going back to Sand Land?

3972
03:29:58,370 --> 03:29:59,870
Is this my new home now?

3973
03:30:05,930 --> 03:30:07,310
Because that's what a forest is.

3974
03:30:23,610 --> 03:30:25,570
I knew you'd show up.

3975
03:30:26,090 --> 03:30:27,650
I'm glad we didn't disappoint.

3976
03:30:28,830 --> 03:30:30,130
We'll give you a hand.

3977
03:30:41,550 --> 03:30:42,150
So,

3978
03:30:45,210 --> 03:30:47,530
Captain, what's your team been getting up to?

3979
03:30:47,690 --> 03:30:49,050
Please, call me Olivia.

3980
03:30:49,550 --> 03:30:51,170
Oh my god, oh!

3981
03:30:51,530 --> 03:30:52,670
First name, faces!

3982
03:30:53,770 --> 03:30:53,990
Wow!

3983
03:30:54,990 --> 03:30:56,430
Olivia!

3984
03:31:04,010 --> 03:31:05,410
Wait,

3985
03:31:17,930 --> 03:31:17,950
he?

3986
03:31:22,510 --> 03:31:23,450
I'm saved!

3987
03:31:25,930 --> 03:31:27,010
So you've heard of him too?

3988
03:31:27,670 --> 03:31:30,770
He's one of the big brains behind the Wyvern's fire technology.

3989
03:31:31,410 --> 03:31:31,850
Wait, what?

3990
03:31:32,310 --> 03:31:34,550
We are so gonna talk later, pal!

3991
03:31:43,260 --> 03:31:44,640
Oh my god!

3992
03:31:45,720 --> 03:31:48,520
It's like more beautiful than some of the others!

3993
03:31:54,000 --> 03:31:56,220
Monsters called the Doshagama have left their...

3994
03:31:56,220 --> 03:31:57,380
What's your skincare?

3995
03:31:58,640 --> 03:32:00,440
As a biologist?

3996
03:32:02,100 --> 03:32:03,600
What the fuck is your...

3997
03:32:03,600 --> 03:32:08,480
Oh, I guess because he goes outside a lot, so his skin must be more moisturized than the others.

3998
03:32:09,260 --> 03:32:11,480
I was gonna be like, the fuck is your skincare?

3999
03:32:16,860 --> 03:32:17,260
Smash.

4000
03:32:17,260 --> 03:32:17,540
Smash.

4001
03:32:21,820 --> 03:32:22,620
Bro,

4002
03:32:26,680 --> 03:32:27,580
look at those lips!

4003
03:32:31,160 --> 03:32:33,340
Like, what's your fucking treatment?

4004
03:32:34,640 --> 03:32:37,340
He uses biology as skincare.

4005
03:32:37,980 --> 03:32:39,480
I was like, bro, man!

4006
03:32:40,300 --> 03:32:41,400
What's your routine?

4007
03:32:43,760 --> 03:32:46,380
Chop that skincare routine, yeah!

4008
03:32:47,990 --> 03:32:48,540
Wait, what?

4009
03:32:50,080 --> 03:32:51,800
I like to request support?

4010
03:32:52,160 --> 03:32:52,660
Oh, request?

4011
03:32:53,580 --> 03:32:54,660
Oh, I don't have any.

4012
03:32:55,240 --> 03:32:56,180
Oh, do I have this?

4013
03:32:57,240 --> 03:32:57,700
Oh!

4014
03:33:01,840 --> 03:33:02,500
Okay.

4015
03:33:05,560 --> 03:33:06,600
Did I get this?

4016
03:33:09,220 --> 03:33:10,280
Oh no, I didn't.

4017
03:33:11,620 --> 03:33:13,940
He rubs the bugs on it.

4018
03:33:13,940 --> 03:33:15,720
Oh, did I talk to Nata?

4019
03:33:16,240 --> 03:33:18,260
I don't like talking to Nata.

4020
03:33:23,620 --> 03:33:26,260
Like, I don't really care too much about Nata.

4021
03:33:41,040 --> 03:33:43,260
I don't think you've been helpful at all, Nata.

4022
03:33:53,320 --> 03:33:53,940
What?

4023
03:33:53,940 --> 03:33:54,440
Wait, you're right.

4024
03:33:55,320 --> 03:33:56,500
Why are you here?

4025
03:34:14,030 --> 03:34:14,650
What?

4026
03:34:15,770 --> 03:34:17,930
Wait, what's the point of talking to him?

4027
03:34:17,930 --> 03:34:20,730
Oh, I guess for lore reasons, I guess.

4028
03:34:20,830 --> 03:34:21,650
Oh, that makes sense.

4029
03:34:21,710 --> 03:34:23,030
I was like, why don't I talk to him?

4030
03:34:24,190 --> 03:34:25,490
Okay, let's see.

4031
03:34:26,650 --> 03:34:28,290
Okay, talk to Eric.

4032
03:34:31,970 --> 03:34:32,770
Alright, Eric.

4033
03:34:32,950 --> 03:34:34,510
I gotta talk to you now.

4034
03:34:36,790 --> 03:34:37,190
Sorry.

4035
03:34:43,090 --> 03:34:43,810
Yeah, let's head out.

4036
03:34:49,990 --> 03:34:50,790
Thank you.

4037
03:34:51,070 --> 03:34:54,270
I was starting to worry that we'd have to sprout wings to keep up.

4038
03:34:56,950 --> 03:34:57,970
Shall we depart?

4039
03:34:59,790 --> 03:35:00,750
Alright, nice.

4040
03:35:01,330 --> 03:35:01,950
Wait, the campsite?

4041
03:35:04,250 --> 03:35:05,970
Oh, is there a new campsite?

4042
03:35:06,370 --> 03:35:06,790
Oh!

4043
03:35:08,410 --> 03:35:08,890
Okay.

4044
03:35:11,830 --> 03:35:12,790
Where's my...

4045
03:35:12,790 --> 03:35:14,230
Do I not get to ride my...

4046
03:35:14,230 --> 03:35:15,290
Oh, I don't.

4047
03:35:15,710 --> 03:35:19,250
I have to walk like a fucking caveman.

4048
03:35:20,570 --> 03:35:21,690
Can't believe it.

4049
03:35:30,000 --> 03:35:31,380
Can't believe it.

4050
03:35:32,080 --> 03:35:34,740
I have to walk to my new campsite?

4051
03:35:34,960 --> 03:35:37,600
What's the point of having a fucking horse?

4052
03:35:39,720 --> 03:35:41,080
How uncivilized.

4053
03:35:44,240 --> 03:35:44,700
Wait, what?

4054
03:35:46,480 --> 03:35:46,880
Oh.

4055
03:35:48,600 --> 03:35:50,340
Guess I'm not allowed to go there.

4056
03:35:51,640 --> 03:35:53,480
But like, it says this way.

4057
03:35:56,780 --> 03:35:57,720
That blue mushroom.

4058
03:35:57,800 --> 03:35:59,460
Oh, I've never seen that bigger wasp before.

4059
03:35:59,640 --> 03:36:00,500
Oh, it's just...

4060
03:36:01,740 --> 03:36:03,180
I just killed a toad?

4061
03:36:03,720 --> 03:36:05,220
Oh, it's like a stun!

4062
03:36:06,300 --> 03:36:07,920
I killed him just for fun.

4063
03:36:11,780 --> 03:36:12,720
Where are these?

4064
03:36:14,560 --> 03:36:15,320
Where are you?

4065
03:36:17,660 --> 03:36:18,380
That's right.

4066
03:36:19,680 --> 03:36:20,920
I did it for fun.

4067
03:36:20,920 --> 03:36:22,920
Oh wait, they might actually kill me.

4068
03:36:24,100 --> 03:36:25,020
There you go.

4069
03:36:25,520 --> 03:36:26,380
That's right!

4070
03:36:28,760 --> 03:36:30,100
I want your meat!

4071
03:36:32,720 --> 03:36:34,020
That's fucking right!

4072
03:36:34,260 --> 03:36:35,000
Give me your meat!

4073
03:36:38,220 --> 03:36:39,440
Oh shit, wait.

4074
03:36:39,720 --> 03:36:41,940
Wait, I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck!

4075
03:36:42,620 --> 03:36:43,040
Oh no!

4076
03:36:43,760 --> 03:36:45,500
Oh no, it's considering me wandering!

4077
03:36:47,000 --> 03:36:48,600
Okay, what do I get from this?

4078
03:36:49,560 --> 03:36:50,400
Oh, a fin!

4079
03:36:54,130 --> 03:36:56,170
Okay, let me get these guys out of the way.

4080
03:37:00,050 --> 03:37:00,830
That's right.

4081
03:37:01,570 --> 03:37:02,610
Get out of here!

4082
03:37:03,230 --> 03:37:04,010
Get out of here!

4083
03:37:07,290 --> 03:37:08,750
Time to carve!

4084
03:37:13,210 --> 03:37:14,130
What do I get?

4085
03:37:15,810 --> 03:37:16,850
Sharp fang.

4086
03:37:18,530 --> 03:37:19,450
Oh, a fin.

4087
03:37:19,450 --> 03:37:20,290
Alright, let's go.

4088
03:37:20,970 --> 03:37:22,310
Sorry, intermission.

4089
03:37:22,990 --> 03:37:24,330
We're ready to go now.

4090
03:37:25,190 --> 03:37:26,490
Ooh, fire herb.

4091
03:37:30,830 --> 03:37:32,750
That was very important, guys.

4092
03:37:34,870 --> 03:37:35,770
Smoke nut.

4093
03:37:39,540 --> 03:37:42,520
I feel like I'm gonna have to kill something soon.

4094
03:37:44,800 --> 03:37:45,860
Wait, you're right.

4095
03:37:47,160 --> 03:37:48,360
It's not red.

4096
03:37:50,760 --> 03:37:52,000
Yeah, why is it red?

4097
03:37:58,110 --> 03:37:59,510
I'm gonna kill the baby.

4098
03:38:10,770 --> 03:38:12,210
He's still alive!

4099
03:38:13,290 --> 03:38:13,870
Nice.

4100
03:38:15,570 --> 03:38:17,730
Wait, I can't even carve the baby.

4101
03:38:17,950 --> 03:38:18,670
What was the point?

4102
03:38:18,970 --> 03:38:19,930
Oh no, I can.

4103
03:38:23,390 --> 03:38:24,010
Nice.

4104
03:38:28,410 --> 03:38:29,950
Look at that.

4105
03:38:30,130 --> 03:38:31,210
Their parents ran.

4106
03:38:31,350 --> 03:38:33,130
Didn't even protect their child.

4107
03:38:37,590 --> 03:38:39,170
What do you mean, water herb?

4108
03:38:39,190 --> 03:38:40,250
It's right here!

4109
03:38:41,430 --> 03:38:43,350
Oh, I have to wait for the...

4110
03:38:47,430 --> 03:38:49,190
Finally, a game for me.

4111
03:38:51,530 --> 03:38:53,950
And now I know why people love Monster Hunter.

4112
03:39:15,320 --> 03:39:15,860
Alright.

4113
03:39:17,360 --> 03:39:18,580
S.O.S.

4114
03:39:19,020 --> 03:39:22,320
I killed a child, so I need help covering up a murder.

4115
03:39:35,380 --> 03:39:38,400
If you join my squad, you're only enabling me.

4116
03:39:43,570 --> 03:39:44,090
Alright.

4117
03:39:44,370 --> 03:39:46,310
As a fash, I can use as a report point.

4118
03:39:46,470 --> 03:39:46,730
Return.

4119
03:39:47,410 --> 03:39:47,690
Okay.

4120
03:39:54,890 --> 03:39:56,890
We should look for any tracks or traces.

4121
03:39:57,230 --> 03:39:59,450
If you join my squad, you're an accomplice to murder.

4122
03:40:05,540 --> 03:40:07,680
And you agree with my message.

4123
03:40:12,430 --> 03:40:12,830
Alright.

4124
03:40:13,350 --> 03:40:15,350
If anybody is gonna update my...

4125
03:40:16,670 --> 03:40:17,070
VTuber...

4126
03:40:17,070 --> 03:40:17,610
What was it?

4127
03:40:17,790 --> 03:40:18,770
VTuber Wikipedia?

4128
03:40:19,010 --> 03:40:20,970
Make sure to put that was born in 1900s.

4129
03:40:23,850 --> 03:40:25,510
That's very important, guys.

4130
03:40:27,490 --> 03:40:28,910
New lore drop.

4131
03:40:30,470 --> 03:40:32,930
And then the footnote can be the beginning of the stream.

4132
03:40:33,290 --> 03:40:35,030
Where it was like, put your date of birth.

4133
03:40:35,250 --> 03:40:36,510
And then I literally put...

4134
03:40:40,150 --> 03:40:41,650
That was born in 1900s.

4135
03:40:43,510 --> 03:40:45,570
Update that wiki right now.

4136
03:40:52,010 --> 03:40:53,910
Is your oshi a true hag?

4137
03:41:00,340 --> 03:41:00,860
Nice.

4138
03:41:05,440 --> 03:41:06,280
Take that.

4139
03:41:07,280 --> 03:41:08,540
Oh, shed fur?

4140
03:41:08,820 --> 03:41:09,420
Who's shedding?

4141
03:41:19,040 --> 03:41:21,340
Oh, Shaxx, I skipped it cause I was pressing F.

4142
03:41:24,360 --> 03:41:25,580
Oh, the dog, Shaguma.

4143
03:41:26,460 --> 03:41:26,960
Show me!

4144
03:41:27,080 --> 03:41:27,880
Thank you for the...

4145
03:41:27,880 --> 03:41:29,120
Thank you for the gifted ships!

4146
03:41:29,220 --> 03:41:30,020
Thank you, thank you!

4147
03:41:31,880 --> 03:41:32,920
Oh, there's more fur.

4148
03:41:35,480 --> 03:41:35,960
Nice.

4149
03:41:36,860 --> 03:41:37,800
What's this?

4150
03:41:41,000 --> 03:41:42,500
Yeah, what is that?

4151
03:41:44,120 --> 03:41:44,980
What's over there?

4152
03:41:46,860 --> 03:41:48,400
Wait, that's not Doshaguma.

4153
03:41:50,940 --> 03:41:51,980
What's that?

4154
03:42:07,160 --> 03:42:10,360
The scat flies seem to be reacting to something deeper in.

4155
03:42:16,550 --> 03:42:17,030
Oh, shit.

4156
03:42:17,570 --> 03:42:18,190
Is it bigger?

4157
03:42:20,990 --> 03:42:22,590
Oh, is it why it's red?

4158
03:42:23,510 --> 03:42:24,270
Is it blood?

4159
03:42:29,440 --> 03:42:30,580
My word.

4160
03:42:32,540 --> 03:42:34,600
Is this a lalabarina, Floret?

4161
03:42:34,960 --> 03:42:35,900
A lalabarina?

4162
03:42:36,640 --> 03:42:37,780
What's a lalabarina?

4163
03:42:38,120 --> 03:42:38,660
It's a monster.

4164
03:42:38,860 --> 03:42:39,440
A temnocerin.

4165
03:42:40,120 --> 03:42:40,580
Smell.

4166
03:42:41,240 --> 03:42:45,420
Oh, like the Doguma got killed?

4167
03:42:49,020 --> 03:42:50,540
Is that why it's red?

4168
03:43:10,580 --> 03:43:13,400
And you made her smell it?

4169
03:43:15,800 --> 03:43:17,840
Breathe the poison deep.

4170
03:43:19,320 --> 03:43:21,280
Yeah, keep breathing in that poison.

4171
03:43:21,280 --> 03:43:24,100
Maybe that's how his skin looks so nice.

4172
03:43:47,800 --> 03:43:49,400
Is Rayden missing?

4173
03:43:49,620 --> 03:43:50,020
How?

4174
03:43:50,180 --> 03:43:51,920
He walked like 5 feet!

4175
03:43:52,040 --> 03:43:53,420
Like he walked 5 feet!

4176
03:43:53,420 --> 03:43:53,520
Why?

4177
03:43:56,620 --> 03:43:59,480
How did he wander off alone in 5 seconds?

4178
03:44:01,660 --> 03:44:04,200
How do you lose him that fast?

4179
03:44:13,050 --> 03:44:14,720
It's like 5 seconds.

4180
03:44:15,360 --> 03:44:16,740
What the fuck?

4181
03:44:16,980 --> 03:44:17,980
5 seconds!

4182
03:44:22,520 --> 03:44:23,720
5 seconds!

4183
03:44:23,720 --> 03:44:24,400
5 fucking seconds!

4184
03:44:25,500 --> 03:44:27,540
Oh, does he turn into a slime?

4185
03:44:37,580 --> 03:44:40,080
What if I just left him to die?

4186
03:44:41,600 --> 03:44:43,400
Oh, I guess not.

4187
03:44:58,080 --> 03:44:59,960
Like, is he really that useful?

4188
03:45:00,080 --> 03:45:01,060
He's a biologist.

4189
03:45:03,760 --> 03:45:06,820
I'm sorry for all the biology majors out there.

4190
03:45:06,940 --> 03:45:09,840
I'm sorry to all the biologists out there.

4191
03:45:17,950 --> 03:45:19,730
My job is to hunt.

4192
03:45:22,750 --> 03:45:23,750
Oh shit.

4193
03:45:24,470 --> 03:45:26,710
It's to hunt, not to study.

4194
03:45:27,670 --> 03:45:29,610
If you think about it.

4195
03:45:36,940 --> 03:45:37,540
Okay.

4196
03:45:41,340 --> 03:45:41,740
Oh!

4197
03:45:44,380 --> 03:45:44,780
Oh!

4198
03:45:46,800 --> 03:45:50,300
Like, I can't even tell if he's supposed to be doing damage to me!

4199
03:45:51,200 --> 03:45:51,600
Wow!

4200
03:45:56,860 --> 03:45:58,960
Okay, I need to make sure I don't get out of here.

4201
03:46:00,820 --> 03:46:04,220
Man, I wanted to use my dual blades, but I can't.

4202
03:46:07,380 --> 03:46:07,780
What?

4203
03:46:09,300 --> 03:46:11,620
Wait, what?

4204
03:46:11,700 --> 03:46:12,380
How did I get hurt?

4205
03:46:14,280 --> 03:46:14,840
Phew!

4206
03:46:20,200 --> 03:46:21,400
Wait, is he blind?

4207
03:46:21,520 --> 03:46:22,620
What is he looking at?

4208
03:46:22,680 --> 03:46:23,320
Is it Garfield?

4209
03:46:26,260 --> 03:46:28,360
Is he looking at Garfield right now?

4210
03:46:30,720 --> 03:46:31,280
Phew!

4211
03:46:32,340 --> 03:46:34,220
Oh nice, I got it.

4212
03:46:37,510 --> 03:46:38,070
Nice.

4213
03:46:42,200 --> 03:46:43,640
What the fuck?

4214
03:46:43,700 --> 03:46:43,960
Okay.

4215
03:46:46,720 --> 03:46:47,480
Oh no.

4216
03:46:47,920 --> 03:46:48,400
Oh no.

4217
03:46:48,400 --> 03:46:48,520
Oh no!

4218
03:46:53,110 --> 03:46:55,420
I think I got weapons off of him.

4219
03:46:58,730 --> 03:46:59,390
Oh!

4220
03:47:02,310 --> 03:47:03,350
Oh shit!

4221
03:47:04,390 --> 03:47:06,730
Wait, I have my- my dog?

4222
03:47:07,470 --> 03:47:08,210
Wait, I do!

4223
03:47:08,590 --> 03:47:09,490
Where is he?

4224
03:47:10,810 --> 03:47:12,130
Wait, I want to swap weapons.

4225
03:47:13,050 --> 03:47:15,270
Nice, it's dual blading time!

4226
03:47:16,370 --> 03:47:17,430
That's right!

4227
03:47:18,770 --> 03:47:19,990
Wait, oh he's gone.

4228
03:47:20,170 --> 03:47:20,910
Okay, nevermind.

4229
03:47:21,830 --> 03:47:23,910
That's right, it's dual blading time!

4230
03:47:23,950 --> 03:47:25,670
Oh my god, it's the legend himself!

4231
03:47:26,510 --> 03:47:27,510
It's him!

4232
03:47:28,570 --> 03:47:29,510
He's here!

4233
03:47:31,190 --> 03:47:33,870
Oh my god, it's level 100, man!

4234
03:47:35,290 --> 03:47:36,850
Oh my god!

4235
03:47:39,310 --> 03:47:40,550
Why is he faster?

4236
03:47:40,830 --> 03:47:43,150
Do you just- are you just faster with level 100?

4237
03:47:43,150 --> 03:47:47,670
Like- Like, don't worry!

4238
03:47:48,930 --> 03:47:49,850
Demon Mode!

4239
03:47:50,750 --> 03:47:51,590
That's right!

4240
03:47:52,370 --> 03:47:53,250
Get over here!

4241
03:47:55,190 --> 03:47:56,550
Get over here!

4242
03:47:57,430 --> 03:47:58,670
That's fucking right!

4243
03:47:59,050 --> 03:48:01,130
I don't know what I'm doing, I'm just slashing!

4244
03:48:01,750 --> 03:48:02,990
Demon Mode!

4245
03:48:06,270 --> 03:48:07,810
I'm just slashing!

4246
03:48:08,390 --> 03:48:10,090
I'm just slashing!

4247
03:48:13,150 --> 03:48:15,070
Demon Mode done!

4248
03:48:16,070 --> 03:48:17,150
Nice!

4249
03:48:18,970 --> 03:48:20,890
It's just that easy!

4250
03:48:21,290 --> 03:48:24,210
Classic dual blade gameplay!

4251
03:48:27,830 --> 03:48:29,290
That's right!

4252
03:48:30,510 --> 03:48:35,190
The hero of Demon Dual Blades in a nutshell!

4253
03:48:36,550 --> 03:48:37,490
Get over here!

4254
03:48:38,410 --> 03:48:39,230
Demon Mode!

4255
03:48:47,540 --> 03:48:48,180
Woo!

4256
03:48:49,180 --> 03:48:49,820
Alright!

4257
03:48:50,300 --> 03:48:50,940
Nice!

4258
03:48:51,080 --> 03:48:52,060
Oh wait, there he is!

4259
03:48:53,360 --> 03:48:55,120
Okay, but this guy is more important!

4260
03:48:55,880 --> 03:48:57,180
I'm coming for you!

4261
03:49:00,660 --> 03:49:01,980
That's fucking right!

4262
03:49:02,960 --> 03:49:04,180
You think you can run?

4263
03:49:05,580 --> 03:49:06,920
You think you can run?

4264
03:49:07,800 --> 03:49:08,900
Demon Mode!

4265
03:49:11,540 --> 03:49:12,680
Jesus Christ!

4266
03:49:13,040 --> 03:49:14,440
This is my entire gameplay!

4267
03:49:14,900 --> 03:49:16,420
Do you think I care?!

4268
03:49:17,420 --> 03:49:20,220
Oh my god, all I do is slash!

4269
03:49:20,500 --> 03:49:22,300
I don't care!

4270
03:49:22,780 --> 03:49:25,400
I don't know what I'm doing, I'm just slashing!

4271
03:49:26,040 --> 03:49:27,740
Okay, Demon Mode down!

4272
03:49:29,200 --> 03:49:30,600
Demon Mode down!

4273
03:49:31,020 --> 03:49:32,460
Demon Mode back on it!

4274
03:49:35,240 --> 03:49:35,540
Woo!

4275
03:49:40,080 --> 03:49:41,680
So easy!

4276
03:49:42,600 --> 03:49:44,200
Oh my god!

4277
03:49:45,600 --> 03:49:46,440
Ground Slash!

4278
03:49:47,420 --> 03:49:48,100
Blade Dance!

4279
03:49:48,280 --> 03:49:49,600
Oh my god!

4280
03:49:50,060 --> 03:49:50,220
Woo!

4281
03:49:53,600 --> 03:49:55,460
That's how you dual blade!

4282
03:49:58,780 --> 03:49:59,660
It's okay.

4283
03:50:00,480 --> 03:50:02,020
That's how you do it.

4284
03:50:03,180 --> 03:50:03,800
Okay.

4285
03:50:04,240 --> 03:50:05,860
Let's get that carcass in.

4286
03:50:07,960 --> 03:50:11,820
I don't know what the fuck happened, but I slashed!

4287
03:50:13,720 --> 03:50:17,140
Oh, there's a- didn't I break a piece of him off?

4288
03:50:19,120 --> 03:50:20,160
I thought I did.

4289
03:50:20,980 --> 03:50:21,740
Did I not?

4290
03:50:23,680 --> 03:50:25,620
I thought I broke a piece of him.

4291
03:50:29,200 --> 03:50:30,580
Are my legs dull?

4292
03:50:30,720 --> 03:50:31,460
I can't tell.

4293
03:50:33,620 --> 03:50:34,020
Okay.

4294
03:50:36,940 --> 03:50:38,200
Where's my sharpener?

4295
03:50:38,720 --> 03:50:39,580
Oh, there it is.

4296
03:50:44,120 --> 03:50:44,880
There we go.

4297
03:50:44,940 --> 03:50:45,740
It's okay now.

4298
03:50:46,740 --> 03:50:48,140
It's okay, I fixed it.

4299
03:50:55,190 --> 03:50:57,470
Oh, someone else grabbed it.

4300
03:50:57,510 --> 03:50:59,410
Oh wait, do I pick it up automatically?

4301
03:50:59,930 --> 03:51:00,770
I don't know.

4302
03:51:00,990 --> 03:51:01,730
I can't tell.

4303
03:51:02,710 --> 03:51:03,530
I did it!

4304
03:51:03,650 --> 03:51:05,090
I killed Lala Barina.

4305
03:51:08,210 --> 03:51:08,770
Nice.

4306
03:51:12,050 --> 03:51:14,190
Oh nice, my Palico leveled up too.

4307
03:51:15,230 --> 03:51:16,030
Oh shit.

4308
03:51:17,610 --> 03:51:18,610
Guys, look.

4309
03:51:18,770 --> 03:51:19,910
Guys, look!

4310
03:51:20,070 --> 03:51:21,970
He's level not 100, okay?

4311
03:51:22,190 --> 03:51:22,850
Of course.

4312
03:51:23,270 --> 03:51:24,910
Of course he achieves.

4313
03:51:24,910 --> 03:51:26,190
Okay, maybe like...

4314
03:51:26,190 --> 03:51:28,150
Dual Blades is not for me, guys.

4315
03:51:28,750 --> 03:51:29,330
Maybe...

4316
03:51:30,550 --> 03:51:32,450
Maybe the bow is cooler.

4317
03:51:39,380 --> 03:51:42,800
Look, he's level 100, guys.

4318
03:51:43,000 --> 03:51:45,900
How am I supposed to match up to a level 100 guy?

4319
03:51:51,740 --> 03:51:52,900
A poison?

4320
03:51:54,080 --> 03:51:56,180
Are we not gonna fix him?

4321
03:51:57,720 --> 03:52:00,460
We're just gonna ignore the fact that he's poisoned right now?

4322
03:52:05,540 --> 03:52:13,160
Thanks for giving Conrad and I a chance to conform before demoting us to Dragoon 2.

4323
03:52:13,500 --> 03:52:15,600
Loki, thank you for the super chat.

4324
03:52:15,700 --> 03:52:16,820
Thank you, thank you.

4325
03:52:19,900 --> 03:52:22,140
No, not Dragoon 2.

4326
03:52:23,240 --> 03:52:24,700
I don't want to sit here.

4327
03:52:24,900 --> 03:52:25,980
I want to help.

4328
03:52:28,040 --> 03:52:29,000
Thank you.

4329
03:52:29,000 --> 03:52:30,420
I'm grateful for your help.

4330
03:52:31,040 --> 03:52:32,380
We'll be counting on you.

4331
03:52:33,620 --> 03:52:34,900
Anything but that.

4332
03:52:35,220 --> 03:52:36,840
Don't put me down there.

4333
03:52:37,760 --> 03:52:38,060
Thanks.

4334
03:52:43,220 --> 03:52:43,520
Okay.

4335
03:52:44,080 --> 03:52:45,160
Oh my, we did it.

4336
03:52:45,260 --> 03:52:47,180
Oh, does that mean we have like...

4337
03:52:47,180 --> 03:52:49,140
Okay, we might have new stuff to...

4338
03:52:49,140 --> 03:52:49,800
Hunter, can I borrow you a sec?

4339
03:52:49,920 --> 03:52:50,460
Oh shit.

4340
03:52:50,800 --> 03:52:50,980
Yeah.

4341
03:52:51,300 --> 03:52:51,780
Yeah?

4342
03:52:52,220 --> 03:52:54,280
Hey, have you been upgrading your weapons?

4343
03:52:55,580 --> 03:52:56,980
And don't give me that.

4344
03:52:57,020 --> 03:52:58,360
I'm a good guild leader, guys.

4345
03:52:58,560 --> 03:52:58,780
Nonsense.

4346
03:52:59,240 --> 03:53:01,080
You want your gear to be effective, right?

4347
03:53:02,000 --> 03:53:04,600
Here, I'm giving you some materials, so no excuses.

4348
03:53:05,080 --> 03:53:05,600
Oh, nice!

4349
03:53:05,760 --> 03:53:06,120
Free stuff!

4350
03:53:06,220 --> 03:53:07,240
I love free stuff.

4351
03:53:08,560 --> 03:53:10,300
Okay, we got Earth Crystals.

4352
03:53:11,040 --> 03:53:11,800
What can we upgrade?

4353
03:53:15,000 --> 03:53:16,280
The weapon tree...

4354
03:53:18,740 --> 03:53:20,380
Shows wild forge items.

4355
03:53:20,500 --> 03:53:22,280
An upgrade list shows what you're currently...

4356
03:53:22,280 --> 03:53:22,740
Oh, okay.

4357
03:53:24,540 --> 03:53:25,340
Oh shit!

4358
03:53:25,500 --> 03:53:25,680
Okay.

4359
03:53:28,700 --> 03:53:30,280
So I can grab...

4360
03:53:31,040 --> 03:53:33,120
Oh, this is a new one that I can have.

4361
03:53:33,540 --> 03:53:34,420
It's 144.

4362
03:53:36,000 --> 03:53:36,740
I don't know.

4363
03:53:37,280 --> 03:53:38,140
Do I try...

4364
03:53:38,140 --> 03:53:39,140
I guess I could.

4365
03:53:42,600 --> 03:53:43,580
I'll think about it.

4366
03:53:43,600 --> 03:53:44,080
I don't know.

4367
03:53:44,180 --> 03:53:45,380
I'll save it for now.

4368
03:53:47,440 --> 03:53:49,700
I feel like I should save it for now.

4369
03:53:51,000 --> 03:53:51,480
Where is...

4370
03:53:51,480 --> 03:53:52,300
Where is my guild?

4371
03:53:53,320 --> 03:53:54,480
Where's my guild thing?

4372
03:53:56,200 --> 03:53:57,360
I need to know.

4373
03:53:58,880 --> 03:54:00,040
Wait, I can fish!

4374
03:54:00,400 --> 03:54:01,360
Wait, I can fish!

4375
03:54:07,710 --> 03:54:09,250
My senses are my fish and my shaman.

4376
03:54:09,370 --> 03:54:09,990
The day I play...

4377
03:54:10,490 --> 03:54:11,950
I suppose I should introduce myself.

4378
03:54:12,490 --> 03:54:13,050
It's a pleasure.

4379
03:54:13,230 --> 03:54:14,190
Wait, can I fish?

4380
03:54:16,350 --> 03:54:17,350
How do I fish?

4381
03:54:21,920 --> 03:54:23,060
I wanna fish.

4382
03:54:27,920 --> 03:54:28,880
Where's my fishy?

4383
03:54:33,570 --> 03:54:35,410
Is no fish gonna bite?

4384
03:54:38,610 --> 03:54:40,090
Wait, is it like...

4385
03:54:40,090 --> 03:54:42,510
Oh, I have to aim it at this guy.

4386
03:54:42,750 --> 03:54:43,070
Okay.

4387
03:54:44,850 --> 03:54:45,750
Bite my...

4388
03:54:45,750 --> 03:54:46,490
Oh shit, okay.

4389
03:54:47,210 --> 03:54:47,670
Bite it.

4390
03:54:49,790 --> 03:54:50,630
Bite it.

4391
03:54:50,850 --> 03:54:51,390
Wait, what?

4392
03:54:53,770 --> 03:54:54,590
Bite it.

4393
03:54:55,170 --> 03:54:55,550
What?

4394
03:54:58,830 --> 03:54:59,970
What the fuck?

4395
03:55:25,280 --> 03:55:26,420
Get my fish!

4396
03:55:28,540 --> 03:55:31,120
I swear to God, if you guys take my fish...

4397
03:55:31,120 --> 03:55:33,160
I swear to God, I don't know what I'm doing.

4398
03:55:34,500 --> 03:55:35,720
What the fuck?

4399
03:55:36,960 --> 03:55:38,540
One of us will get that fish.

4400
03:55:42,400 --> 03:55:43,480
This is not fair.

4401
03:55:45,360 --> 03:55:46,860
I want that one fish.

4402
03:55:50,720 --> 03:55:52,300
Oh my God, please!

4403
03:55:53,320 --> 03:55:54,960
Why can't I fish?

4404
03:55:55,940 --> 03:55:57,620
Wait, why does it do that?

4405
03:56:03,930 --> 03:56:05,950
Why does it like auto-reel?

4406
03:56:08,510 --> 03:56:09,370
Yeah.

4407
03:56:12,650 --> 03:56:14,030
This is bullshit.

4408
03:56:15,440 --> 03:56:16,910
This is actually bullshit.

4409
03:56:17,770 --> 03:56:20,730
I don't know what I'm doing, I'm sad.

4410
03:56:28,340 --> 03:56:29,480
Getting fish!

4411
03:56:32,240 --> 03:56:34,920
Why is your cat allowed to fish?

4412
03:56:35,860 --> 03:56:37,630
Why can't my cat fish?

4413
03:56:38,480 --> 03:56:40,060
Garfield, fish right now!

4414
03:56:41,540 --> 03:56:42,760
Garfield, fish!

4415
03:56:49,120 --> 03:56:52,260
Why is my fish not working?

4416
03:56:53,560 --> 03:56:55,360
Why can't my cat fish?

4417
03:56:58,700 --> 03:57:00,520
What's wrong with him?

4418
03:57:04,840 --> 03:57:07,220
What the fuck is wrong with him?

4419
03:57:15,840 --> 03:57:17,280
This is not fair.

4420
03:57:17,940 --> 03:57:19,260
This is not fair.

4421
03:57:19,880 --> 03:57:21,320
My cat can't fish.

4422
03:57:21,520 --> 03:57:22,460
This is not fair.

4423
03:57:26,040 --> 03:57:31,660
Come on, come on, come on, right here, right here, come on.

4424
03:57:34,880 --> 03:57:35,400
Fucking...

4425
03:57:35,400 --> 03:57:37,860
Why does the... I give up.

4426
03:57:38,320 --> 03:57:40,720
I fucking give up, I cat fish.

4427
03:57:41,300 --> 03:57:43,900
I don't... wait, wait, no, I can do this.

4428
03:57:44,040 --> 03:57:45,220
I can get this one fish.

4429
03:57:46,000 --> 03:57:47,160
I can do it.

4430
03:57:47,660 --> 03:57:48,320
Come on.

4431
03:57:48,940 --> 03:57:49,940
Come on!

4432
03:57:51,140 --> 03:57:52,520
How does it work?

4433
03:57:55,120 --> 03:57:58,600
How does this... why is everybody else getting fish?

4434
03:58:01,700 --> 03:58:03,220
How does this work?

4435
03:58:12,990 --> 03:58:13,470
Somebody...

4436
03:58:13,470 --> 03:58:14,190
Come on.

4437
03:58:15,610 --> 03:58:16,490
It's right here.

4438
03:58:16,850 --> 03:58:17,530
Get over here.

4439
03:58:17,650 --> 03:58:18,270
Come on.

4440
03:58:18,890 --> 03:58:20,550
Right over here, right over here.

4441
03:58:20,650 --> 03:58:21,470
Come on, I see you.

4442
03:58:22,570 --> 03:58:22,930
Whoa.

4443
03:58:23,330 --> 03:58:24,190
Whoa, I see you.

4444
03:58:24,630 --> 03:58:25,050
Whoa.

4445
03:58:25,950 --> 03:58:26,850
Whoa, I see you.

4446
03:58:27,090 --> 03:58:27,750
Who caught that?

4447
03:58:28,390 --> 03:58:29,810
Who caught that?

4448
03:58:31,390 --> 03:58:31,950
Right here.

4449
03:58:32,030 --> 03:58:32,890
Right here.

4450
03:58:33,230 --> 03:58:33,870
Whoa.

4451
03:58:35,130 --> 03:58:35,870
Right here.

4452
03:58:36,230 --> 03:58:37,630
Guys, guys, right here.

4453
03:58:38,930 --> 03:58:40,110
Guys, right here.

4454
03:58:40,210 --> 03:58:40,990
No, no, no.

4455
03:58:41,450 --> 03:58:42,210
Right here.

4456
03:58:44,210 --> 03:58:45,810
Guys, it's right here.

4457
03:58:47,050 --> 03:58:47,590
Guys!

4458
03:58:48,530 --> 03:58:50,170
Give me my fish!

4459
03:58:52,530 --> 03:58:54,210
I'm so sad.

4460
03:58:55,050 --> 03:58:56,530
I'm so sad.

4461
03:58:56,530 --> 03:58:57,990
Why won't fish bite?

4462
03:58:59,590 --> 03:59:01,930
Why fish don't want food?

4463
03:59:03,370 --> 03:59:05,790
I don't understand.

4464
03:59:09,680 --> 03:59:10,360
How fish?

4465
03:59:12,800 --> 03:59:13,880
How fish?

4466
03:59:15,100 --> 03:59:16,240
I give up.

4467
03:59:16,460 --> 03:59:18,000
You guys, I give up.

4468
03:59:18,200 --> 03:59:19,400
Fish won today.

4469
03:59:20,420 --> 03:59:21,260
Fish...

4470
03:59:21,680 --> 03:59:23,240
Fish won today.

4471
03:59:23,940 --> 03:59:24,340
I...

4472
03:59:26,380 --> 03:59:27,980
I don't...

4473
03:59:27,980 --> 03:59:29,320
Why is your cat wearing clothes?

4474
03:59:32,020 --> 03:59:33,660
Why is your cat wearing clothes?

4475
03:59:35,100 --> 03:59:35,760
Momiji?

4476
03:59:36,900 --> 03:59:38,340
Why is it wearing clothes?

4477
03:59:43,840 --> 03:59:44,260
Oh.

4478
03:59:45,420 --> 03:59:46,220
Oh.

4479
03:59:46,360 --> 03:59:47,640
Oh, she's AFK?

4480
03:59:47,900 --> 03:59:48,240
Okay.

4481
03:59:49,180 --> 03:59:49,580
Alright.

4482
03:59:49,900 --> 03:59:51,520
Just cause you're AFK...

4483
03:59:53,160 --> 03:59:54,940
That is unfortunate.

4484
03:59:57,460 --> 03:59:58,600
You know what?

4485
03:59:59,000 --> 04:00:01,320
You're saved by your Dragoon buddies.

4486
04:00:01,820 --> 04:00:03,380
Just cause you're AFK.

4487
04:00:04,080 --> 04:00:05,220
You're lucky.

4488
04:00:06,000 --> 04:00:06,900
You're so lucky.

4489
04:00:07,080 --> 04:00:07,320
Alright.

4490
04:00:07,460 --> 04:00:08,440
It's time to check...

4491
04:00:08,440 --> 04:00:09,280
Where's Alma?

4492
04:00:11,040 --> 04:00:11,680
Alma!

4493
04:00:12,960 --> 04:00:14,000
Oh, Alma!

4494
04:00:15,000 --> 04:00:16,260
It's time to check...

4495
04:00:16,260 --> 04:00:16,480
Oh, wait.

4496
04:00:16,500 --> 04:00:17,000
Not Alma.

4497
04:00:17,180 --> 04:00:18,400
Where's the guild people?

4498
04:00:19,740 --> 04:00:20,000
Okay.

4499
04:00:20,000 --> 04:00:21,280
There's Gemini.

4500
04:00:22,240 --> 04:00:22,880
There's...

4501
04:00:22,880 --> 04:00:23,060
Wait.

4502
04:00:23,100 --> 04:00:24,920
Where's the guild woman?

4503
04:00:25,620 --> 04:00:27,300
Is the guild woman not here?

4504
04:00:29,560 --> 04:00:30,740
I guess she's not.

4505
04:00:30,920 --> 04:00:31,020
Okay.

4506
04:00:31,060 --> 04:00:31,760
You guys are lucky.

4507
04:00:32,440 --> 04:00:33,020
I can't...

4508
04:00:33,020 --> 04:00:34,420
I can't double check on you guys.

4509
04:00:35,140 --> 04:00:35,560
I can't...

4510
04:00:35,560 --> 04:00:37,020
I can't check on my guild here.

4511
04:00:37,380 --> 04:00:37,840
Alright.

4512
04:00:39,000 --> 04:00:39,460
Alright.

4513
04:00:39,780 --> 04:00:40,140
I...

4514
04:00:40,140 --> 04:00:40,700
Oh my god.

4515
04:00:40,740 --> 04:00:41,620
I've been streaming for four...

4516
04:00:41,620 --> 04:00:41,780
Okay.

4517
04:00:41,840 --> 04:00:42,400
I'm gonna call it here.

4518
04:00:42,640 --> 04:00:43,100
Cause...

4519
04:00:43,100 --> 04:00:43,400
I...

4520
04:00:43,400 --> 04:00:44,940
I can't fuck up my voice.

4521
04:00:47,340 --> 04:00:47,800
But!

4522
04:00:48,020 --> 04:00:49,480
We're not ending yet!

4523
04:00:50,160 --> 04:00:50,620
Because...

4524
04:00:50,620 --> 04:00:52,300
We still have our giveaway!

4525
04:00:52,840 --> 04:00:55,100
So let me set that up right now.

4526
04:00:55,300 --> 04:00:55,640
Yeah.

4527
04:00:55,660 --> 04:00:56,820
It's actually been four hours.

4528
04:00:56,900 --> 04:00:57,640
That's actually crazy.

4529
04:00:57,840 --> 04:00:59,800
So let me set up my giveaway now.

4530
04:00:59,960 --> 04:01:00,440
Alright!

4531
04:01:01,060 --> 04:01:03,680
So I think I still have my text from the last giveaway.

4532
04:01:03,860 --> 04:01:04,180
Do I?

4533
04:01:04,680 --> 04:01:05,020
Wait.

4534
04:01:05,080 --> 04:01:05,620
I do.

4535
04:01:05,860 --> 04:01:06,280
Okay.

4536
04:01:08,460 --> 04:01:08,940
Alright.

4537
04:01:09,020 --> 04:01:10,000
Where is my cat?

4538
04:01:10,260 --> 04:01:10,880
Where's Garfield?

4539
04:01:11,760 --> 04:01:13,000
And where did my cat go?

4540
04:01:13,360 --> 04:01:14,480
Guys, where did my cat go?

4541
04:01:15,040 --> 04:01:15,460
Garfield?

4542
04:01:15,940 --> 04:01:16,420

04:01:23,900 --> 04:01:24,540
Oh, there you are.

4548
04:01:24,720 --> 04:01:25,840
Garfield, what the fuck are you doing?

4549
04:01:26,060 --> 04:01:26,580
Get up.

4550
04:01:26,820 --> 04:01:27,620
Get up.

4551
04:01:27,960 --> 04:01:28,400

4552
04:01:28,600 --> 04:01:29,260
Get up here.

4553
04:01:29,400 --> 04:01:30,240
Get over here, Garfield.

4554
04:01:31,120 --> 04:01:31,820
Why are you...

4555
04:01:31,820 --> 04:01:33,000
Garfield, get over here.

4556
04:01:33,100 --> 04:01:33,620
That's right.

4557
04:01:34,280 --> 04:01:34,720
Okay.

Before we go!

4562
04:01:40,280 --> 04:01:41,060
That was really fun though.

4563
04:01:41,120 --> 04:01:42,220

4564
04:01:43,380 --> 04:01:43,820

04:02:27,060 --> 04:02:28,140
Hunter...

4598
04:02:28,720 --> 04:02:29,280
Code...

4599
04:02:29,280 --> 04:02:29,720
Wait.

4600
04:02:29,760 --> 04:02:31,020
What did I put last time?

4601
04:02:31,040 --> 04:02:31,220
Wait.

4602
04:02:31,300 --> 04:02:31,760
Okay, guys.

4603
04:02:31,840 --> 04:02:32,580
I'm gonna...

4604
04:02:32,580 --> 04:02:34,880
I'm gonna swap real quick.

4605
04:02:35,220 --> 04:02:36,340
I'm gonna swap real quick.

4606
04:02:36,780 --> 04:02:38,540
Because I just want to copy this.

4607
04:02:38,660 --> 04:02:38,860
Okay.

4608
04:02:38,880 --> 04:02:39,500
There we go.

4609
04:02:40,000 --> 04:02:41,060
Enter for monster...

4610
04:02:41,060 --> 04:02:41,300
Okay.

4611
04:02:41,380 --> 04:02:42,280
It's this one.

4612
04:02:42,320 --> 04:02:42,600
Okay.

4613
04:02:43,060 --> 04:02:44,960
It's text 10222.

4614
04:02:45,060 --> 04:02:45,360
Okay.

4615
04:02:45,360 --> 04:02:45,420
Okay.

4616
04:02:45,520 --> 04:02:47,180
We're gonna move back to the other one.

4617
04:02:47,960 --> 04:02:48,060
Okay.

4618
04:02:48,480 --> 04:02:49,340
Only use it once.

4619
04:02:49,420 --> 04:02:52,960
Because if you do it more than once, it actually removes your entry.

4620
04:02:53,360 --> 04:02:56,000
So, like, make sure you don't do multiple times.

4621
04:02:56,260 --> 04:02:58,720
I think if you spam it, it removes it.

4622
04:02:58,800 --> 04:02:59,140
So, yeah.

4623
04:02:59,240 --> 04:03:02,240
Just make sure you don't do it multiple times.

4624
04:03:02,340 --> 04:03:03,140
And you'll be fine.

4625
04:03:03,740 --> 04:03:04,040
Alright.

4626
04:03:04,860 --> 04:03:05,780
Here you go.

4627
04:03:06,640 --> 04:03:07,660
Enter for monster...

4628
04:03:07,660 --> 04:03:10,460
If you win, give us your app for your Twitter or Twitch account.

4629
04:03:10,560 --> 04:03:12,120
And we have five codes.

4630
04:03:12,660 --> 04:03:13,280
Alright, guys.

4631
04:03:13,700 --> 04:03:14,550
I'm gonna give, like...

4632
04:03:14,550 --> 04:03:17,650
I'm gonna give, like, 10 seconds.

4633
04:03:17,790 --> 04:03:19,270
So, make sure you don't spam enter.

4634
04:03:19,490 --> 04:03:22,610
Because it will remove your entry if you do spam enter.

4635
04:03:23,010 --> 04:03:24,750
It's exclamation point, enter.

4636
04:03:25,430 --> 04:03:26,330
And you should be fine.

4637
04:03:26,530 --> 04:03:27,290
Is it case sensitive?

4638
04:03:27,610 --> 04:03:28,670
That's a good question.

4639
04:03:28,850 --> 04:03:29,790
Let me check real quick.

4640
04:03:33,510 --> 04:03:35,210
It's capital letter E.

4641
04:03:37,630 --> 04:03:40,610
I don't know if it's case sensitive, guys.

4642
04:03:40,810 --> 04:03:43,870
But just to be sure, it's capital E.

4643
04:03:44,550 --> 04:03:46,470
Just as it's written over here.

4644
04:03:47,550 --> 04:03:48,590
So, like...

4645
04:03:48,590 --> 04:03:50,570
I'm not sure if it is case sensitive.

4646
04:03:50,830 --> 04:03:52,390
But, like, I'm not gonna...

4647
04:03:52,390 --> 04:03:53,390
I don't wanna risk it.

4648
04:03:53,650 --> 04:03:55,190
Look at all of them clapping for it.

4649
04:03:55,630 --> 04:03:57,970
Look at all of them clapping for it.

4650
04:03:58,430 --> 04:04:00,170
Clapping for the giveaway.

4651
04:04:01,650 --> 04:04:03,150
Like, yeah, giveaway!

4652
04:04:04,510 --> 04:04:05,030
Yeah!

4653
04:04:05,970 --> 04:04:07,170
Alright, I'm gonna do a countdown.

4654
04:04:07,490 --> 04:04:08,490
And I'll pull the first winner.

4655
04:04:09,170 --> 04:04:10,370
Five, four...

4656
04:04:10,370 --> 04:04:13,090
Again, thank you to MSI for sponsoring today's stream.

4657
04:04:13,090 --> 04:04:18,070
My mods have been, like, using the commands regarding the special collaboration that MSI is doing.

4658
04:04:18,270 --> 04:04:20,570
MSI is providing these game codes for me.

4659
04:04:20,830 --> 04:04:23,430
So, huge shoutout to MSI for the sponsor.

4660
04:04:23,910 --> 04:04:27,790
Alright, five, four, three, two, one.

4661
04:04:27,850 --> 04:04:28,970
I'm pulling the first winner.

4662
04:04:32,850 --> 04:04:33,890
Suchan WS!

4663
04:04:34,310 --> 04:04:34,830
Congratulations!

4664
04:04:36,310 --> 04:04:38,090
Congratulations on being the first winner.

4665
04:04:38,410 --> 04:04:41,370
We need you to type a reply I have on my nightbot.

4666
04:04:41,370 --> 04:04:44,370
It does show me your messages when you do type in it.

4667
04:04:44,450 --> 04:04:48,230
So, yeah, let me know if you're live and you can see yourself.

4668
04:04:49,250 --> 04:04:50,390
I need to know if you're live.

4669
04:04:50,550 --> 04:04:57,230
If you don't respond within 30 seconds, I will have to, unfortunately, pull...

4670
04:04:57,990 --> 04:04:59,530
I will pull another...

4671
04:04:59,530 --> 04:05:01,890
Not 30 seconds, I'll do, like, 40, 50 seconds.

4672
04:05:01,990 --> 04:05:03,690
Just to be, like, you know...

4673
04:05:03,690 --> 04:05:04,950
You know, just to give you guys time.

4674
04:05:05,370 --> 04:05:09,510
But, you have not typed anything yet, so I am a little worried.

4675
04:05:15,870 --> 04:05:19,830
Let me do the add to Suchan.

4676
04:05:19,990 --> 04:05:20,490
Alright.

4677
04:05:21,450 --> 04:05:22,570
Best, congratulations!

4678
04:05:23,170 --> 04:05:27,850
If you can provide us your Twitter ad or your Twitch ad, just let us know.

4679
04:05:28,210 --> 04:05:29,610
Our Twitch is Suchan.

4680
04:05:29,710 --> 04:05:30,650
Alright, congratulations!

4681
04:05:32,190 --> 04:05:35,410
My mods will be providing you guys the codes and everything.

4682
04:05:36,030 --> 04:05:38,490
So, just make sure to check your whispers.

4683
04:05:39,070 --> 04:05:40,190
Check your whispers.

4684
04:05:40,190 --> 04:05:41,890
Check your DMs.

4685
04:05:42,130 --> 04:05:44,070
And make sure your DMs are open for Twitter.

4686
04:05:44,610 --> 04:05:47,350
Because my mods will be providing the codes.

4687
04:05:47,730 --> 04:05:48,670
Alright, next winner!

4688
04:05:49,770 --> 04:05:51,490
The next winner is...

4689
04:05:51,490 --> 04:05:53,990
But, you guys can enter even after we draw winners, too.

4690
04:05:54,070 --> 04:05:55,050
So, don't worry about, like...

4691
04:05:55,050 --> 04:05:56,730
Oh, no, I was too late to enter.

4692
04:05:57,190 --> 04:05:57,870
Next winner!

4693
04:05:58,630 --> 04:05:59,150
OZERO!

4694
04:05:59,810 --> 04:06:00,330
Congratulations!

4695
04:06:01,370 --> 04:06:02,750
Congratulations, OZERO!

4696
04:06:03,330 --> 04:06:05,170
For winning the second game code!

4697
04:06:05,310 --> 04:06:05,650
Yeah!

4698
04:06:05,650 --> 04:06:06,690
Yeah!

4699
04:06:08,390 --> 04:06:11,870
Like I said, we just need your ad for your Twitter and Twitch.

4700
04:06:12,110 --> 04:06:15,010
So, the second code is 1byOZERO.

4701
04:06:15,110 --> 04:06:15,610
Congratulations!

4702
04:06:16,710 --> 04:06:16,990
Yeah!

4703
04:06:17,930 --> 04:06:19,310
And then, you can join...

4704
04:06:20,770 --> 04:06:22,150
Alright, remember...

4705
04:06:22,150 --> 04:06:23,630
I hope my mods are writing this down.

4706
04:06:24,510 --> 04:06:25,450
I hope...

4707
04:06:25,450 --> 04:06:27,390
I hope they're writing down the winners.

4708
04:06:28,350 --> 04:06:28,870
Alright.

4709
04:06:29,050 --> 04:06:29,970
Oh, that was fast.

4710
04:06:30,070 --> 04:06:31,950
We already got straight away the ad.

4711
04:06:32,310 --> 04:06:32,830
Congratulations!

4712
04:06:33,310 --> 04:06:34,290
The second code.

4713
04:06:34,290 --> 04:06:35,570
Alright, third code.

4714
04:06:35,990 --> 04:06:37,250
We're going by super fast.

4715
04:06:37,370 --> 04:06:38,350
Because I also...

4716
04:06:38,350 --> 04:06:40,690
I need to walk Doki Amber Doge after this.

4717
04:06:41,290 --> 04:06:43,310
I didn't think I'd be streaming for four hours.

4718
04:06:43,670 --> 04:06:45,390
But, like, I actually got, like...

4719
04:06:45,390 --> 04:06:46,630
Sunked in.

4720
04:06:47,030 --> 04:06:47,830
With Monster Hunter.

4721
04:06:50,210 --> 04:06:50,690
Patchesaur!

4722
04:06:50,910 --> 04:06:51,350
Congratu...

4723
04:06:51,350 --> 04:06:52,890
And also, like, my voice is fucking dying.

4724
04:06:55,030 --> 04:06:55,510
Patchesaur!

4725
04:06:55,810 --> 04:06:57,050
Congratulations, Patchesaur!

4726
04:06:58,630 --> 04:06:59,110
Congratulations!

4727
04:07:01,890 --> 04:07:03,450
Yeah, that's our third code!

4728
04:07:04,370 --> 04:07:04,810
Woo!

4729
04:07:06,930 --> 04:07:07,810
As always...

4730
04:07:07,810 --> 04:07:08,610
See, guys?

4731
04:07:08,710 --> 04:07:10,530
I told you we guys got better at this.

4732
04:07:10,910 --> 04:07:12,090
I told you guys.

4733
04:07:12,430 --> 04:07:13,630
Yeah, the last...

4734
04:07:13,630 --> 04:07:15,690
You know, when we did the pre...

4735
04:07:16,670 --> 04:07:19,350
When we did the pre-giveaway codes...

4736
04:07:19,350 --> 04:07:21,030
Like, before the stream...

4737
04:07:21,030 --> 04:07:22,350
It was pretty bad.

4738
04:07:22,730 --> 04:07:23,350
I would admit.

4739
04:07:23,650 --> 04:07:24,930
It was pretty fucking bad.

4740
04:07:26,770 --> 04:07:28,210
We were all over the place.

4741
04:07:28,370 --> 04:07:29,750
But now, look at us go.

4742
04:07:30,030 --> 04:07:31,630
We are so professional now.

4743
04:07:32,350 --> 04:07:33,250
We did it.

4744
04:07:33,250 --> 04:07:34,270
We figured it out.

4745
04:07:34,350 --> 04:07:35,490
It only took one stream.

4746
04:07:35,850 --> 04:07:37,870
It only took one stream of a failed attempt.

4747
04:07:37,990 --> 04:07:39,230
But now, we're doing good.

4748
04:07:39,610 --> 04:07:40,090
Now...

4749
04:07:40,090 --> 04:07:41,470
Now, it's like...

4750
04:07:41,470 --> 04:07:42,570
Bam, bam, bam.

4751
04:07:43,650 --> 04:07:44,770
So professional.

4752
04:07:46,090 --> 04:07:47,210
Congratulations, Patchesaur!

4753
04:07:47,550 --> 04:07:48,870
This is my third one?

4754
04:07:49,210 --> 04:07:49,790
Oh, shit.

4755
04:07:50,350 --> 04:07:50,890
Okay, wait.

4756
04:07:51,390 --> 04:07:51,950
One...

4757
04:07:52,930 --> 04:07:53,490
Guys...

4758
04:07:54,110 --> 04:07:55,030
Okay, guys.

4759
04:07:56,290 --> 04:07:56,850
One...

4760
04:07:58,490 --> 04:07:59,050
Two...

4761
04:07:59,050 --> 04:07:59,870
Sorry.

4762
04:08:01,770 --> 04:08:02,330
One...

4763
04:08:02,330 --> 04:08:02,950
Oh, shit.

4764
04:08:03,430 --> 04:08:03,910
One...

4765
04:08:08,480 --> 04:08:09,760
Give me a sec.

4766
04:08:10,460 --> 04:08:10,940
One...

4767
04:08:11,720 --> 04:08:12,200
Two...

4768
04:08:12,200 --> 04:08:12,820
Three.

4769
04:08:12,900 --> 04:08:13,800
Okay, we're at the third.

4770
04:08:13,880 --> 04:08:14,580
Okay, this is the...

4771
04:08:14,580 --> 04:08:15,660
Next one is the fourth.

4772
04:08:16,220 --> 04:08:17,980
The next one is the fourth, guys.

4773
04:08:18,120 --> 04:08:19,600
We got this, everybody.

4774
04:08:21,100 --> 04:08:22,440
Sorry, I had to...

4775
04:08:22,440 --> 04:08:23,200
I lost count.

4776
04:08:24,020 --> 04:08:25,080
We're still professional.

4777
04:08:27,080 --> 04:08:28,700
The next winner is...

4778
04:08:30,160 --> 04:08:30,640
Behind...

4779
04:08:30,640 --> 04:08:31,260
What was it?

4780
04:08:31,380 --> 04:08:31,920
Oh, shit.

4781
04:08:31,980 --> 04:08:32,560
I pulled two.

4782
04:08:32,560 --> 04:08:33,580
Oh, shit.

4783
04:08:33,620 --> 04:08:35,880
Guys, we just pulled two at the same time.

4784
04:08:40,400 --> 04:08:40,960
Whoops.

4785
04:08:41,400 --> 04:08:42,280
Sorry, I...

4786
04:08:42,280 --> 04:08:43,700
Okay, this is a little more...

4787
04:08:43,700 --> 04:08:45,960
Okay, now we're getting into the scuffed territory.

4788
04:08:46,520 --> 04:08:47,860
But we pulled two.

4789
04:08:50,400 --> 04:08:50,960
Yay!

4790
04:08:53,940 --> 04:08:55,500
That's four and five.

4791
04:08:57,440 --> 04:08:58,680
We did it!

4792
04:09:00,540 --> 04:09:01,800
We're so professional.

4793
04:09:02,560 --> 04:09:03,600
Oh, I actually...

4794
04:09:03,600 --> 04:09:04,780
I double-clicked, guys.

4795
04:09:05,000 --> 04:09:06,640
I double-clicked.

4796
04:09:08,240 --> 04:09:09,200
Very professional.

4797
04:09:09,900 --> 04:09:14,740
But congratulations, Behindjul and ZealousNeko.

4798
04:09:15,280 --> 04:09:17,760
Remember to give your Twitter at or your Twitch at.

4799
04:09:18,520 --> 04:09:20,180
And then, that should be it.

4800
04:09:20,300 --> 04:09:23,720
But I'm gonna wait until Behindjul and...

4801
04:09:23,720 --> 04:09:25,200
Okay, I can't see Neko.

4802
04:09:26,060 --> 04:09:29,520
So, like, I hope that my mods will be okay in trying to find them.

4803
04:09:29,520 --> 04:09:30,120
Oh.

4804
04:09:31,940 --> 04:09:33,100
Okay, we got Neko.

4805
04:09:33,920 --> 04:09:36,680
Behindjul, if you are alive, we need to know.

4806
04:09:37,200 --> 04:09:37,540
You have...

4807
04:09:38,680 --> 04:09:39,560
You have...

4808
04:09:40,560 --> 04:09:43,880
You have 15 seconds to claim your code.

4809
04:09:45,360 --> 04:09:45,800
Behindjul?

4810
04:09:47,000 --> 04:09:47,440
Behindjul?

4811
04:09:48,400 --> 04:09:49,780
Behindjul, where are you?

4812
04:09:51,060 --> 04:09:51,500
No!

4813
04:09:52,080 --> 04:09:53,300
Okay, I'll give him, like, 10 more.

4814
04:09:53,400 --> 04:09:53,960
Wake up!

4815
04:09:54,180 --> 04:09:55,420
Wake up, Behindjul!

4816
04:09:55,420 --> 04:09:56,480
He hasn't even said hi.

4817
04:09:57,120 --> 04:09:58,920
Guys, we might actually have to do another claim.

4818
04:09:58,920 --> 04:10:00,820
Okay, I'll give him, like, 5 more seconds.

4819
04:10:02,360 --> 04:10:03,720
Wake up, Behindjul!

4820
04:10:04,180 --> 04:10:05,080
You got the...

4821
04:10:05,080 --> 04:10:06,040
Wake up!

4822
04:10:06,540 --> 04:10:08,140
Guys, he's not alive.

4823
04:10:09,040 --> 04:10:10,380
Bro, he's not alive.

4824
04:10:10,780 --> 04:10:13,460
I gave him, like, a minute and 12 seconds, guys.

4825
04:10:17,140 --> 04:10:18,760
Yeah, you might have to dig out the VOD chat.

4826
04:10:18,840 --> 04:10:19,720
I forgot to give you the...

4827
04:10:19,720 --> 04:10:22,680
I forgot to, like, tell you what the Twitter handles were.

4828
04:10:22,760 --> 04:10:25,380
I just saw it on my end and I was like, okay, there they are.

4829
04:10:26,820 --> 04:10:27,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

4830
04:10:27,720 --> 04:10:29,760
We might have to pull a fifth one.

4831
04:10:30,140 --> 04:10:31,680
He hasn't awakened.

4832
04:10:31,840 --> 04:10:34,140
I'm gonna wait until, like, it hits 30 seconds.

4833
04:10:36,000 --> 04:10:37,080
How did he snooze?

4834
04:10:37,120 --> 04:10:39,160
We're going by so fucking fast, too.

4835
04:10:39,820 --> 04:10:41,800
I don't think he realized it was 5 codes.

4836
04:10:41,940 --> 04:10:43,980
Alright, he has 0 messages.

4837
04:10:44,560 --> 04:10:45,660
We're pulling a new winner.

4838
04:10:48,020 --> 04:10:48,980
Tugging Fortuna.

4839
04:10:49,060 --> 04:10:50,460
What a fucking name.

4840
04:10:55,400 --> 04:10:56,360
Tugging Fortuna.

4841
04:10:57,020 --> 04:10:57,420
Congratulations!

4842
04:10:58,600 --> 04:10:59,860
You won the last code!

4843
04:11:00,120 --> 04:11:01,920
If you are allowed to claim it.

4844
04:11:02,940 --> 04:11:04,020
Alright, he gave...

4845
04:11:04,020 --> 04:11:06,920
Okay, I knew I forgot one thing for my mod.

4846
04:11:07,040 --> 04:11:10,560
In the past, I would just copy and paste what the handle was.

4847
04:11:10,960 --> 04:11:13,400
But then, like, I forgot to do that and I just said it out loud.

4848
04:11:13,680 --> 04:11:17,500
So, like, my mod has to look through the chat now to find the other handle.

4849
04:11:17,980 --> 04:11:27,000
But, if you did win and my mod has not written down your handle yet, feel free to add my mod, SilentCactus, so you can write down your handle.

4850
04:11:30,000 --> 04:11:32,200
Oh my god, but congratulations, everybody!

4851
04:11:32,680 --> 04:11:33,820
For winning the code!

4852
04:11:34,700 --> 04:11:38,900
Thank you, guys, for the fun times with Monster Hunter Wilds Launch.

4853
04:11:39,180 --> 04:11:42,280
I had a great time playing Monster Hunter Wilds.

4854
04:11:42,300 --> 04:11:45,120
And playing with my Dragoons and playing on launch day.

4855
04:11:45,240 --> 04:11:47,120
It was really, really fucking fun.

4856
04:11:47,600 --> 04:11:50,320
And, honestly, like, great experience.

4857
04:11:50,940 --> 04:11:54,100
Like, you guys, I don't know about doing more of a series for this.

4858
04:11:54,100 --> 04:11:55,020
I'm not sure yet.

4859
04:11:55,680 --> 04:11:57,140
But we'll see how I feel.

4860
04:11:57,600 --> 04:11:58,780
We'll see how I feel.

4861
04:11:58,880 --> 04:12:01,260
Because, like, I did have a really fun time.

4862
04:12:01,760 --> 04:12:03,740
I just don't know if I want to make it a series.

4863
04:12:04,660 --> 04:12:07,800
Because I do have Dynasty Warriors and stuff like that, too.

4864
04:12:08,080 --> 04:12:09,120
So, I don't know.

4865
04:12:09,560 --> 04:12:15,160
I really do want to finish Dynasty Warriors first before we get into another series.

4866
04:12:17,560 --> 04:12:19,060
But it was really fun.

4867
04:12:19,140 --> 04:12:21,860
I definitely want to do this as a member stream in the future, for sure.

4868
04:12:24,100 --> 04:12:24,980
But thank you guys.

4869
04:12:25,280 --> 04:12:26,800
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

4870
04:12:27,280 --> 04:12:29,840
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

4871
04:12:30,360 --> 04:12:31,020
Posture check.

4872
04:12:31,280 --> 04:12:33,440
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4873
04:12:33,780 --> 04:12:35,880
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

4874
04:12:35,940 --> 04:12:37,240
Because you deserve it.

4875
04:12:37,420 --> 04:12:39,140
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4876
04:12:39,760 --> 04:12:40,640
Bye, guys.

4877
04:12:41,220 --> 04:12:41,660
Bye.
