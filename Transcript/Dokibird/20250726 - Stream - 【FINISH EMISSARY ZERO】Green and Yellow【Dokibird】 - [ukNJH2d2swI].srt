1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,680
Hello!

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,900
Hello, everyone!

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,400
Hi!

4
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,120
Hi!

5
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi, guys!

6
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,800
We are back with more in Missionary Zero.

7
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,700
We're here to save the moon!

8
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,020
Yeah!

9
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,760
So, like, if you guys can tell, we're all white except for mint.

10
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,780
Uh... Oh.

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,700
I didn't get the memo.

12
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,200
At least this time we all have our spacesuits on.

13
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,200
We all...

14
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah!

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,280
We all have our own little spacesuits this time!

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,160
Yeah!

17
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,580
We're letting us rent them out.

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,180
Thanks to the artist that I found.

19
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:43,400
Oh!

20
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,600
That you found?

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,540
Yeah, Min's the main character now.

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,160
It's me!

23
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,020
Um, the reason why we were a little late is because I actually made a public lobby.

24
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,600
...and...

25
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,700
...and...

26
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,980
Ray, are you watching?

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,740
Are you watching this?

28
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,440
I'm sorry if we didn't give you a warm welcome.

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,240
Yeah!

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,560
We were like, get out!

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,360
Leave!

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,660
Who are you?

33
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,920
Who are you?

34
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:16,440
Who are you?

35
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,320
I feel bad if they, like, aren't our viewer and then they joined and we were all just like, who is that?

36
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:24,560
Yeah!

37
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,820
We were all just yelling at him!

38
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,000
We were all just screaming at him!

39
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,720
Did he hear you guys?

40
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,620
He never said hi!

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,320
Yeah.

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,060
Yeah, he never said hi to us too.

43
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,020
We were all like...

44
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,980
Are you to be fair?

45
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,300
It was like, four women screaming at him.

46
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,460
I feel like he was intimidated.

47
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,540
I know, just be like, what?

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,420
What is it?

49
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,440
Where are you?

50
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,980
He's like, get out of here!

51
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,180
And I'm like, wait, I can kick him, guys.

52
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,780
But, um, it was actually really funny because, like, when we were all getting together for the stream.

53
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,960
Um, Min and Nimi were like, I don't remember how I played a game.

54
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,280
No.

55
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,860
But then the thing is, on the other side, the yellow women, Doobie and I, we were making a plan.

56
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:07,720
Yeah.

57
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,420
They were making a plan!

58
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,640
Yeah, we were making a plan.

59
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,760
We could be carried today.

60
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,580
We wrote notes down.

61
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,560
Yeah, we wrote notes.

62
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,180
We are reliable people, right, Doobie?

63
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,080
Uh-huh.

64
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,600
Yeah, us yellow women, we know what to do.

65
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,400
We worked it out in our brains.

66
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah, we worked it out.

67
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,780
What are you guys bringing to the table, huh?

68
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,400
Yeah, what were you guys doing?

69
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,560
I break the color, I break the, I do the cooking, I do the cleaning.

70
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,500
What about you, Nimi, huh?

71
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,440
What's your job?

72
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm, I'm white.

73
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,280
I'm

74
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,630
prepared, I forgot my homework at home.

75
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,630
What were we doing?

76
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,670
I don't remember.

77
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,910
Okay, okay, so, so, remember this area where there was that man that kept killing us?

78
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,730
So, we're gonna skip that for now.

79
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,110
We're gonna do the easier task.

80
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,870
Okay, okay.

81
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:14,430
So, um, the thing is, um, the, the, the trees with orange leaves, that one, um, we dug up two of those.

82
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,650
But what happened to those items?

83
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,390
Oh, no.

84
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,430
Oh, yeah, we don't have any items.

85
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,450
I guess we gotta get them again.

86
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,810
I feel like, yeah, so, okay, but we have to, because we've, I already see one tree, yellow, orange tree in front of me.

87
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,810
And there's one.

88
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,450
But it says two out of five in the.

89
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,370
Yeah, but we, we need to put the items in the yellow car.

90
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:34,590
Oh.

91
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,710
So, we need to figure out.

92
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,270
We lost that.

93
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,950
Maybe, maybe it's in that, maybe it's in the, the, the vending machine, remember?

94
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:41,650
Yeah.

95
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,490
Oh, it could be.

96
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:42,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

97
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,050
Let's go to the vending machine first.

98
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,930
How do we...

99
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,150
Okay, hold on, I need to...

100
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,310
What's the controls again for this game?

101
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,830
The ship is right.

102
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:50,930
Wow, thank you.

103
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,510
There's a vending machine over here.

104
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:53,250
Oh.

105
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:55,210
Alright.

106
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:55,990
This building.

107
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,010
Yeah, this is the building.

108
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,630
Oh, there's a shop.

109
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,410
Oh, I found it.

110
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:00,970
There, there, there.

111
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,470
There is.

112
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,250
Okay.

113
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,090
Oh, they're right here.

114
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,190
So, the thing about it is that, it's just one yellow car.

115
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,630
I don't remember where the, I don't know where the yellow car is, but I know where all the trees are.

116
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,210
Well, I don't know where all the trees are, but I know where some of the trees are.

117
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,450
We gotta explore for the trees.

118
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:17,950
Yeah.

119
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:19,390
So...

120
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,550
So, someone has to carry the other two items.

121
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,410
Okay, everyone.

122
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,810
Alright, let's go.

123
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,530
I'll watch.

124
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,090
Who is breathing?

125
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,110
Okay, so...

126
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,890
We got this tree.

127
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,410
Look at those cats.

128
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,690
Yeah, I think it's the cats.

129
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,850
Oh, there, there's also a tree over here on this side.

130
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,930
Wait, did we dig the...

131
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,570
We didn't dig that one, right?

132
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,970
Uh, I'm not sure, but there's like a...

133
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,090
Right.

134
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,170
Oh!

135
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,650
Watch out!

136
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,270
Don't die.

137
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:46,970
Don't die.

138
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,130
Oh, yeah.

139
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,570
Oh, yeah.

140
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:50,290
Alright.

141
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,610
Dig.

142
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,290
I'll carry this one.

143
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,850
Alright.

144
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,410
Yay!

145
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,070
Okay, we still, we need to find the yellow car for this too.

146
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,870
Oh, I found another one!

147
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,990
Oh my god, the cat's here.

148
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,690
Oh, wait, that thing's bad.

149
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,290
That's a cat?

150
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,190
Yeah, the cat's here!

151
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:03,490
Oh!

152
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,530
Meow, meow, meow!

153
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:05,870
It's okay, it's okay.

154
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:06,630
I'll run past it.

155
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,330
Okay.

156
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,450
It's fine, I live.

157
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,590
I think it's on to me.

158
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,930
Okay, it's fine, it's fine.

159
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:13,910
Most of us is...

160
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,230
Oh, no!

161
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,230
Nope, he's behind us.

162
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,890
I think we lost mint, and I think I'm bringing it this way.

163
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,630
Oh, I have to see the yellow car anywhere.

164
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,750
Okay.

165
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,730
Can we dig this one already?

166
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,930
I think it would show like a pile of dirt.

167
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,370
Wait, is that yellow car?

168
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,010
Wait, that's yellow!

169
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,650
Is that yellow?

170
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,770
Is that yellow?

171
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,330
Is it yellow?

172
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:34,770
No, that's blue.

173
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,330
It's blue.

174
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,310
It's not yellow.

175
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:37,570
It's blue.

176
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:37,930
It's blue.

177
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,230
It's blue.

178
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,870
Where did the mint go?

179
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,070
I see her.

180
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:41,510
I see her.

181
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,930
I see her.

182
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,550
She's not white.

183
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,450
Oh, wait, no, that's...

184
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:43,550
Oh.

185
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,470
Hi!

186
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,230
Wait, that's...

187
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,070
Oh!

188
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,390
Oh my god!

189
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,290
Get over here!

190
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:51,730
Get over here!

191
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,090
Get over here!

192
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,510
Get over here!

193
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:54,950
Ah!

194
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,950
Oh my god.

195
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,390
Also, I hope this sounds okay.

196
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,150
We just started the game.

197
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,190
I can't believe she was alive.

198
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,650
I thought she was dead.

199
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,030
Our savior, our hero.

200
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:36,770
Our hero!

201
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,910
See, that's why you were the main character.

202
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,890
I thought you were... We all thought you were dead.

203
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,670
No, I was just by myself.

204
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,850
I was scared.

205
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,750
We were literally trying to revive you.

206
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,690
I think we gotta find the yellow car and then maybe the...

207
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,690
There's a thing all the way over there.

208
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,230
Be careful.

209
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:04,570
Okay.

210
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,210
Oh, wait.

211
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,350
Oh, what the hell is that?

212
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:06,730
Oh, wait.

213
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,390
Hey, he's here.

214
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,490
This guy's here.

215
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,030
Oh, wait.

216
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,210
The yellow car's over here.

217
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:10,510
Oh.

218
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:10,930
Oh.

219
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:11,310
Oh.

220
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,050
Okay, okay.

221
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,450
Wait, what's he saying?

222
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,290
No, never mind.

223
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,290
I thought it was yellow.

224
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:15,830
I'm blind.

225
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,370
Oh, it's not.

226
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,290
Yellow woman can't see yellow.

227
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,110
Never mind.

228
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,030
Wait, yellow woman can't see yellow?

229
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,230
Yeah.

230
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,850
It looked yellowish.

231
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,090
We just needed a...

232
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:29,670
The orange, finally.

233
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,350
Yeah, we should help him.

234
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,010
Oh.

235
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,370
Pick the orange.

236
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:33,850
Do we have it?

237
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,290
I don't remember where it was.

238
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,510
I don't remember, too.

239
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,630
Oh, we just didn't find this goddamn yellow car.

240
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,670
It has to be, like, outside here.

241
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,410
In the parking lot.

242
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,190
It's inside in the... in here?

243
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:45,950
Oh.

244
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,530
In the middle?

245
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,890
Maybe?

246
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,410
Oh.

247
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,410
Oh, yeah.

248
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,850
That's part where we left.

249
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,450
There was a guy over here, so we should be careful.

250
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,990
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

251
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:55,810
No, I remember.

252
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,710
I...

253
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,370
I definitely remember.

254
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:00,930
Maybe that's on this side.

255
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,170
I'm gonna check this side.

256
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:03,810
Oh, my...

257
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,290
Like, cause we didn't go too...

258
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,050
We didn't explore this area too much.

259
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,090
Did we explore this...

260
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,950
Did we explore all of this side?

261
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,910
I don't think so.

262
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,610
This is, like, the part that loops around, isn't it?

263
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:17,550
Yeah.

264
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,030
It's probably down here, right?

265
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:19,530
Oh.

266
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,270
Yeah, this was the car and...

267
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,470
There's so many cars.

268
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,990
Surely one of them is yellow?

269
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,350
Yellow car!

270
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,730
To get in.

271
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,290
yellow car.

272
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,430
Oh.

273
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:28,950
No.

274
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:29,970
Please.

275
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,670
What if we have to go all the way back to the beginning?

276
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,890
Oh, there's no way.

277
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:33,890
There's no way.

278
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,570
Nooo.

279
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,050
I thought you took notes?

280
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,070
I did!

281
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,290
I took notes!

282
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,410
But there's so many cars.

283
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,070
Then the guy, there's the jumpy guy.

284
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:41,930
There's the jumpy guy.

285
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,690
Oh, there's the jumpy.

286
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

287
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:43,870
I'm gonna go forward.

288
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,490
I'm going forward.

289
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,650
I'm going for it, I'm going for it.

290
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,110
Okay, here we go.

291
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,150
We went left, right?

292
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,270
Okay, let's go right.

293
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,370
There has to be one yellow car.

294
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,430
Maybe it's with all these guys in here.

295
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,730
Yeah, it could be over here.

296
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,050
Oh, that's true, that's true.

297
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,050
Aren't we missing someone?

298
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,130
I don't know, there's no cars over here.

299
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,510
Oh my god, are we?

300
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,210
Mimi?

301
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,550
Wait, where's your other green woman?

302
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,090
She's fine, right?

303
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,990
Green woman lost.

304
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,870
Green woman lost.

305
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,850
I thought I just saw her over here.

306
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,450
Maybe she split up.

307
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,110
Split up, gang.

308
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,030
All right, well, wait, where's Doobie?

309
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,630
Where's the other yellow woman?

310
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,130
Oh, okay, let's see it.

311
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:36,670
There, let's see.

312
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,570
Oh, hello, oh, nice.

313
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,690
Wait, where did you drop your... I dropped the battery somewhere, because I died.

314
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,250
Oh, oh.

315
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,370
Oh, no.

316
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:44,130
Oh, no.

317
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:44,710
It's okay.

318
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,230
We'll find there.

319
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,550
Oh, I see it, I see it, I see it.

320
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,550
I got it.

321
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,230
I got it.

322
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,170
Doki's got it, yeah.

323
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:53,970
I got it, I got it.

324
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,930
So we gotta go... we gotta go... uh... wait, where my shovel?

325
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,830
You can have multiple items in your inventory.

326
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,910
Wait, what happened to my shovel?

327
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:06,770
It's back there.

328
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,610
Okay, I got my... wait.

329
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,790
Wait, I can't... oh, no, I can't carry the shovel, because it's too heavy.

330
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:18,770
Yeah, yeah.

331
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,590
Wait, where did Doobie go?

332
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,510
Doobie?

333
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,530
Should we... should we... She should be fine, right?

334
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,530
Right?

335
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,050
I'm not sure she's just looking for the yellow car.

336
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,110
Yeah, the goddamn elusive yellow car.

337
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,250
Yeah.

338
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,490
I don't think it's out here.

339
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,450
Is it not?

340
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,270
I mean, right to the right is the other guy, yeah.

341
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,010
Oh my god, okay.

342
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,870
I thought it was, like, closer.

343
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,070
It's... oh!

344
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,090
Wait, Doobie did something.

345
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:53,850
What?

346
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,770
What did Doobie do?

347
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:22,050
Wait, how do you know Doobie did something?

348
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,430
Sherry him, I'm gonna check if it's yellow!

349
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,830
Ah, he's following you!

350
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,430
Okay, I'm gonna check if it's yellow, guys.

351
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,550
Guys, it's yellow!

352
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,230
It's yellow, it's yellow, it's yellow, it's yellow!

353
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,290
That's the yellow car.

354
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,410
That's the yellow car.

355
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,680
Please head over there, put the battery in!

356
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,770
They're all... Just put it in!

357
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,550
Okay, we found it.

358
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,230
Okay, one out of five.

359
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,050
Wait, where's Nimi?

360
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,150
I'm a hero.

361
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,210
Okay, but now we're missing Nimi.

362
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,790
Wait, are you alive?

363
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,930
Oh my god, I have so many!

364
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,670
Nimi, you're so...

365
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,430
It's okay, we're fine.

366
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,330
We're so safe.

367
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,350
We're so safe.

368
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,190
We're so safe.

369
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,070
See, we're okay.

370
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,370
I think we lost Nimi.

371
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,630
Wait, wait, Nimi, you're alive!

372
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,150
Wait, Nimi!

373
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,250
We found the yellow car!

374
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:44,890
Hello.

375
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,110
We found the yellow car.

376
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,030
Oh wait, Nimi!

377
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,010
I couldn't tell because you were all white!

378
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,570
We dropped the battery near the yellow car, though.

379
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,430
Oh, okay, okay, so we found the yellow...

380
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,310
It's on the back of the car.

381
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:58,710
Yeah.

382
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,030
Yeah, yeah, I'll take... I'll take Doobie to it.

383
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:02,990
Okay.

384
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,130
I'll lure them out, don't worry.

385
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,330
I found a map of all the batteries and where the car is.

386
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,370
It's over there, though.

387
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,070
We can go afterwards.

388
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,430
Okay, yeah, nice, nice.

389
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,590
So, we just need to find...

390
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,530
We just have like two more batteries and then...

391
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,090
Because that unlocks one of the electrical boards.

392
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,290
Oh.

393
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

394
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:21,830
All right.

395
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,950
See, I told you.

396
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,050
I told you I took notes.

397
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,430
Run through the building.

398
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,270
It's okay, I live.

399
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,810
Where is that random battery?

400
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,230
The house told it existed.

401
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,650
Where is it?

402
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,890
Where is this battery?

403
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,510
Oh!

404
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,990
Where is...

405
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,810
Where is the other battery?

406
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:47,630
Oh, there it is.

407
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,070
Okay, okay.

408
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:49,590
That's cool!

409
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,270
Wait, where am I now?

410
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:54,950
I don't know.

411
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:56,370
Wait, where is...

412
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,690
We say certain items are buried in...

413
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,350
Okay, I'll follow Doobie, Doobie...

414
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,030
Oh, Dad, that's the tree!

415
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:03,890
There's a tree!

416
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,590
Oh my god.

417
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:06,670
Oh my god.

418
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,270
You're so...

419
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,530
You're still chasing after her.

420
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,590
Oh, I see!

421
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,250
Wait, I see the tree.

422
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,110
I see it, I see it.

423
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,430
I got it here.

424
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,910
Oh!

425
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:17,790
Oh!

426
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,090
Oh!

427
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,090
Which white woman is this?

428
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,870
Which one is this?

429
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,670
Which green woman?

430
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,750
Who are you?

431
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,270
Come here, come here, come here.

432
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:29,950
Come here.

433
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,350
Come here.

434
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,070
It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here.

435
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,630
I dug it.

436
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,230
Oh, you got it?

437
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:36,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

438
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,490
I got one of them.

439
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,170
Alright, here's a building that'll show the last map of the last battery.

440
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,010
Okay, and then you can pick that up.

441
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,630
Man!

442
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,370
I'm here!

443
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,890
Oh, there's one in the back, too.

444
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:49,970
Wait, there's a body!

445
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,170
Oh, they're safe!

446
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,730
Oh, save, save, save, save!

447
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,090
What is that?

448
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,530
It's a giant headman.

449
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,690
I'm so jumpy today, holy cow!

450
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:00,950
There's a map here.

451
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,470
Okay, so we need one more.

452
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,110
We're missing one more battery.

453
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,610
I don't know which one we got.

454
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,010
Yeah, it's kind of hard to tell.

455
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,250
I think we just need the one right here that you passed, no?

456
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,710
No, no, we need one more.

457
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,530
I think two more.

458
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,450
No, yeah, so it has to be on the other side.

459
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,810
Where all the other trees were.

460
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,790
Wait, did we save?

461
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,790
Yeah, we did.

462
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:29,650
Yeah, okay.

463
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,230
Wait, what happened to the... Did you guys pick up the other battery?

464
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:33,870
No.

465
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,470
Which...

466
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,270
It's okay.

467
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,430
The one that I just dug up, it's like over there, but also there's a...

468
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,170
Oh yeah, that's what I was saying.

469
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:39,710
I think...

470
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,590
Is that not the last one?

471
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,150
No, no.

472
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,130
It's three out of five, so we're missing one more.

473
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,090
Uh...

474
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:44,630
Oh, oh.

475
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,250
You're right.

476
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:45,930
I think...

477
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,910
You know, there's numbers.

478
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:48,830
Oh, I see it.

479
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,190
I see it.

480
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,110
I can't count!

481
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,870
Okay, we have to go to the yellow car.

482
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,970
Alright, I'm gonna see if I can find the last...

483
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,110
Wait, I see a tree over...

484
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,630
No, maybe it's just a tree like...

485
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,010
Maybe.

486
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:07,810
I'll go over.

487
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,730
I'll check it.

488
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,330
Doesn't hurt.

489
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,510
Wait, how do we get out?

490
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,050
Oh, here we go.

491
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:16,850
There's a door.

492
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,430
Wow, thanks, Doki Bird.

493
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,190
No problem.

494
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,750
The wisdom is...

495
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,330
Is infinite.

496
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,970
Oh, Doki Bird.

497
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,410
I'm almost positive we've gotten this.

498
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,390
Yeah, we...

499
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,850
Yeah, but some of the...

500
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,250
It says, like, some of them.

501
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,510
Did we dug it out?

502
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,790
Wait, I'll give you guys the battery and I'll go back to the map and check...

503
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,070
Okay.

504
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:36,570
Okay.

505
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,830
There might be one over here.

506
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,250
Watch out for the hell!

507
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,130
It's okay, you can't reach me.

508
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:44,850
It's too thick.

509
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:45,710
Oh, you're right.

510
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:46,810
You stuck trapped.

511
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,730
Okay, this is a dead end.

512
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,150
I thought I could get to the other side.

513
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,290
Wait, I can!

514
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:54,810
Yeah.

515
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,250
Is there any trees here?

516
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,440
Trees.

517
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:08,810
Oh!

518
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

519
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,030
I remember.

520
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,730
Oh, so it's like a shortcut.

521
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,070
Oh, yeah, you have to go back to the yellow car.

522
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:18,950
Can you...

523
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,970
Do you think you can do it?

524
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,110
There's a guy right inside, no?

525
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,250
I just want some walk.

526
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,050
Oh, it's um...

527
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,030
It's the orange things.

528
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,850
Little orange glows.

529
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,010
Oh, yeah.

530
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,010
Maybe it's back here.

531
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,160
Okay.

532
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,640
Oh yeah!

533
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,050
Oh my god, where is the last tree?

534
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:46,990
Hello, TV man.

535
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:47,630
Oh, wait.

536
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,570
This is for me?

537
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,070
That's really kind of you.

538
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,070
With your help, I think I might finally manage the head replacement.

539
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,490
I've heard there's a deeper path in the basement that leads straight into the laboratory.

540
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,070
See you in the basement, and check your map.

541
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,370
There's a hidden way into the basement outside of the main building.

542
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,070
Oh?

543
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:06,930
Oh, what?

544
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,050
Oh, okay.

545
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,010
Oh, he's gone.

546
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,830
I didn't really process what he meant by that.

547
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,550
There's a secret way to the basement.

548
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,710
Outside the main building.

549
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,710
Outside the main building.

550
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,110
Wait, no, not this way.

551
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:21,990
Sorry, I'm lost.

552
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,490
Yeah, where are we going?

553
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,050
We need... We're literally missing one tree.

554
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,670
One tree.

555
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,910
One dream.

556
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,150
We must have gone this long.

557
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,310
It's just... It was dug.

558
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,590
Yeah, see, like, this is dugged up.

559
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,510
So we got this one.

560
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,570
Was there another one?

561
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,770
There was another one on the other side.

562
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,510
We got that one.

563
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,870
Yeah, that's three.

564
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,270
So we're... We need... Here, hold on.

565
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,830
Let's save right here, just in case.

566
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,350
Oh, Doobie should be alive, right?

567
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:52,650
Right?

568
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,670
No, yeah, Doobie is alive.

569
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,670
So maybe to the right?

570
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,670
Okay, we got... That's three.

571
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:00,770
Watch out!

572
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:00,770
Watch out!

573
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,290
Oh, watch out!

574
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,350
He's coming!

575
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,450
Oh, no!

576
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,610
Three, four... Where the fuck is the... That's the fifth tree!

577
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,010
That's the fifth tree!

578
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,230
This one?

579
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,670
We had to have gotten this one.

580
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,630
Apparently we got this one.

581
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,930
But I counted five!

582
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,630
What happened to the last battery?

583
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,950
I counted.

584
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,310
I think it's missing somewhere.

585
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,770
Maybe we dropped it when somebody died, and we don't realize.

586
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:25,850
Oh, no!

587
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,010
Did we respawn in somewhere?

588
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,350
Oh, no!

589
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:34,090
That's... That's not a good thing.

590
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:39,870
Uh, what... Was it inside this building when we spawned?

591
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,150
That's not good.

592
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,810
We're... We're literally missing...

593
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,770
There's a picture of the map with my phone.

594
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:46,990
Oh, gosh.

595
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:47,930
Oh, nice!

596
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,510
The thing is, Doobie, we found all the trees, but...

597
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,290
Those trees have been dugged up.

598
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,950
But we counted one tree twice.

599
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,630
Did we count one tree twice?

600
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,710
Okay.

601
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:01,810
The far right.

602
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:03,710
One...

603
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:05,430
Two...

604
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,650
I think it's, like, all the way to the right.

605
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:08,790
All the way to the right?

606
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,190
All the way down this way.

607
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,190
Okay, I'll... I'll give you the shovel.

608
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,510
Wait, actually, wait.

609
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,570
Green women!

610
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,230
Put the battery in.

611
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,170
One of you guys should lure.

612
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,750
Yellow women will find the last tree.

613
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,130
Let's split up, gang.

614
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:22,550
All right, let's go.

615
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,230
Let's go here, right?

616
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:23,550
Okay.

617
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,390
Is this... Is this a good idea?

618
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,030
It'll be fine.

619
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,490
I'm trusting those two.

620
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,370
I don't know if it's well placed...

621
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,190
They got it.

622
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,790
They got it.

623
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,310
They got it.

624
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,070
Okay, one.

625
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,090
There should be one, like, all the way over here.

626
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:42,790
I think.

627
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,670
Oh, wait.

628
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,170
I bet it's on the other side.

629
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,230
No, that's the...

630
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,490
Like, of this lot.

631
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,530
Didn't we... No, we...

632
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:49,710
We got it.

633
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,190
It's the one next to the house, remember?

634
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,110
We dug that up together.

635
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:53,730
Yeah, but...

636
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,230
There's...

637
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,050
That one over there, but what if we keep going?

638
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,490
I don't see an orange tree, though.

639
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,830
Wait, what is that thing over there?

640
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,470
I think that's...

641
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,230
Maybe we'll unlock that later?

642
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,170
Oh...

643
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,250
Well, I want to open this gate.

644
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,050
Maybe, uh...

645
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,310
It has to be on the other side.

646
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,470
Because I was looking at the map, and there's a bunch of trees here that are super close to each other.

647
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,830
Oh, I think they already put it in.

648
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,730
Oh, they did it!

649
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:18,870
Yes, four out of five.

650
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,310
You guys did it!

651
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,290
You guys did it!

652
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,330
The green women did it!

653
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,070
We did it!

654
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,970
We're still trying to find the orange tree.

655
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,790
We're still trying to find...

656
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,970
You counted how many?

657
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,130
I don't know.

658
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,710
YouTubers aren't very good at counting.

659
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:34,850
You...

660
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,430
YouTubers are not good at counting.

661
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:37,950
Oh, an egg.

662
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:38,650
Oh!

663
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,310
Oh, egg.

664
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,630
Because we dug that tree over there.

665
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:43,970
We dug the tree.

666
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,530
Alright, we gotta go fast.

667
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,550
We gotta go fast.

668
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:47,350
Wait.

669
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,750
Yeah, we're gonna make it.

670
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,270
I believe.

671
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,170
I feel like it might be in here.

672
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:57,770
Oh!

673
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,150
Oh!

674
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,990
Oh!

675
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,030
Oh!

676
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,550
Wait, what's this?

677
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:06,730
Yeah.

678
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:07,810
I found it!

679
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,720
Oh, he's right behind me, isn't he?

680
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,340
Oh!

681
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,800
He's right behind me, isn't he, guys?

682
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:25,740
Hello?

683
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,600
Oh, my God!

684
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,840
His head extends!

685
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,040
Oh, my God!

686
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,460
His head extends!

687
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,860
Oh, I don't like that.

688
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,000
No, I don't think so.

689
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,000
Wait.

690
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,100
Okay, so, we got...

691
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,160
Where is...

692
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,580
Where is this?

693
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,700
This map is so confusing.

694
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:47,620
Alright.

695
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,480
Blue the car?

696
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah, what is the blue?

697
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,160
That's where we are.

698
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,180
That's where we are.

699
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,720
So, we got the one...

700
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,600
We got the tree to the left side.

701
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,220
So, we need to get...

702
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,840
These three.

703
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,600
This is a confusing map.

704
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,820
I know!

705
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,780
I'm like...

706
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,480
Snowsets!

707
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,580
Doobie even took a photo of it.

708
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,720
The real...

709
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,660
This is the real horror.

710
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,760
Reading a map.

711
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,380
Reading a map.

712
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,100
Who is that out there?

713
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,720
That's Doobie.

714
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,060
Oh, Doobie!

715
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,510
Doobie?

716
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,470
Blair witching out here.

717
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,510
Yeah, I was gonna say.

718
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,010
I don't know, I'm fixing something.

719
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,950
You guys are fixing something on us.

720
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,150
You're good, you're good.

721
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:38,650
Okay, don't worry.

722
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,130
We'll protect you, Doobie.

723
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,810
We'll protect you.

724
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:42,170
Ah!

725
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:42,870
Ah!

726
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,450
Did you guys find it?

727
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,050
No.

728
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:46,810
No.

729
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,850
We got this.

730
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,750
Like, it's on the other side.

731
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,570
That's the thing.

732
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:52,670
The tree.

733
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,010
Alright.

734
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:53,790
We had it.

735
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,130
Maybe someone dropped it.

736
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,930
No, it said we didn't dig it though.

737
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:57,870
At chat.

738
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:58,730
Where is it?

739
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,790
At chat.

740
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,250
Where the fuck is the last tree?

741
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,410
It's over there.

742
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,650
Over where?

743
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,210
Okay.

744
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,490
Just follow the road.

745
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,230
But I've dug that.

746
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,750
We've dug this tree.

747
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:18,250
One.

748
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:19,510
Okay.

749
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,390
Tree.

750
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,570
Is there a tree in here?

751
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,830
There.

752
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,890
Wait.

753
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:26,730
At the car?

754
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:30,930
Okay.

755
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,470
We dug this one.

756
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,790
There's no pile here.

757
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,430
One.

758
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:36,910
Okay.

759
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,010
Tree one.

760
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,590
And then two is the one on the cross.

761
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,170
Two.

762
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:42,830
Tree.

763
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:43,890
Three.

764
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,810
It's here.

765
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,870
Which we've also dug.

766
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,060
Three.

767
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,260
Three.

768
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,500
And then... four is on the far right.

769
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,640
Dug four out of five.

770
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,980
It says it on the passwords.

771
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,080
Yeah, okay, and then four is over here.

772
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,040
This one's dug up too.

773
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,100
Four.

774
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,640
We didn't dig here.

775
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,780
We did not dig here!

776
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,830
No, I think it reset because we definitely did before.

777
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,810
It was right here.

778
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,950
Mint, pick this up.

779
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,350
Why me?

780
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,610
It's your fault.

781
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,730
It's your fault.

782
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,190
It's me!

783
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,110
It's my fault?

784
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:33,410
Okay.

785
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,370
It's always the main character's fault.

786
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,050
Okay, I'm the main character.

787
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:39,790
I'll put this in.

788
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,830
Do we have to like start the car or something?

789
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,370
No, it opens an electrical board.

790
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,610
I'm gonna watch from here.

791
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:51,810
Yeah?

792
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,150
Yeah, I don't wanna... I don't really wanna deal with that.

793
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,530
I don't... I don't really wanna be a part of that.

794
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,530
Hey, it's always safer over here.

795
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,570
Yeah, I feel so safe.

796
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,050
Okay, after that, we just need to put that in electrical board.

797
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,950
We have to go to the laboratory lab for that.

798
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,370
Oh, we have to go back to the lab?

799
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:12,930
Yeah, yeah.

800
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,630
You should have got it, right?

801
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,530
I don't even remember where it is.

802
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:17,910
Oh, me too.

803
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,250
I thought one of us did.

804
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,250
I thought one of us took the notes for that.

805
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,510
I just took notes on where we were dying.

806
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,450
Uh...

807
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,470
Wait, I don't see the objective anymore on the top.

808
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,550
Yeah, so they got it, but they still have to bring the electrical board over.

809
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,210
Oh, okay.

810
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,250
Some of my chat was like, Team Yellow hiding.

811
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,670
Um, we're not hiding.

812
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,310
We're just, um...

813
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:41,910
We're thinking.

814
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,550
Yeah, we're thinking here.

815
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:43,870
Yeah.

816
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,950
We're strategizing for the green women.

817
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:46,870
Exactly.

818
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:47,670
Mm-hmm.

819
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,890
We're the guides.

820
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:50,590
We're the players.

821
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,410
Yeah, we're the Sherpas.

822
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,890
We're the man in the chairs.

823
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:54,770
Exactly.

824
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,010
We're here to delegate not to do.

825
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,090
Mm-hmm.

826
00:26:59,210 --> 00:26:59,750
Yeah, yeah.

827
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,870
It's definitely not like Phasmophobia where the scared...

828
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,470
the most scared person sits in the van.

829
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,450
Yeah, yeah.

830
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,370
No, no, no, no, no.

831
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,730
Yeah, you can tell that I'm not one of them because...

832
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,850
I have a shovel.

833
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,710
And you have the lab.

834
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:12,210
Yeah.

835
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,290
Yeah, so they need us.

836
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,550
Yeah.

837
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,110
It is taking them a while though.

838
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,830
I hear them coming back.

839
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:20,390
Hello?

840
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:21,990
Green women?

841
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:24,770
Are they...

842
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,890
Green women?

843
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,910
We could probably make it to the next building.

844
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,490
There's the saves over there.

845
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:30,850
Oh.

846
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:31,530
Oh wait.

847
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,950
Oh wait, I think I see them.

848
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,030
That's one of them.

849
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,270
What happened to the other one?

850
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,730
What was in the trunk?

851
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:39,410
Did you get it?

852
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,570
What was in the trunk?

853
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,850
That was your job.

854
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:42,870
Oh, no.

855
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,270
There was a guy right there!

856
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,530
My dog was to put in the thing.

857
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,090
Wait.

858
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,450
What happened to Nimi?

859
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:49,970
Uh-oh.

860
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:50,970
Uh-oh.

861
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:51,670
Um...

862
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,310
Sheba?

863
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:53,830
Um...

864
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,890
Did we go to the save point?

865
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,310
That's why there were two of you.

866
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,770
One to grab the item and the other to put it in.

867
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,370
No, there was a guy right behind me.

868
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,430
It was blocking the...

869
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,230
The...

870
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:03,910
The trunk.

871
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,730
We have to go this way.

872
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,310
Oh, yeah!

873
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:06,210
Okay.

874
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:06,950
That trunk.

875
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,730
All that junk junk in that trunk.

876
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,630
Okay, we got...

877
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,910
Oh wait, there's a save point here, right?

878
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,170
Yeah.

879
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:11,790
Yeah.

880
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:12,410
Oh, is there?

881
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:12,570
Yeah.

882
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,190
Alright, Nimi.

883
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,910
What did mint do to you?

884
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,470
Get you drunk.

885
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,570
Get you loved drunk.

886
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:19,110
Go!

887
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:24,390
Wait, you guys have to grab the...

888
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,330
The electrical board.

889
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,730
Yeah, where's the electrical box?

890
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:27,350
I don't know!

891
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,670
It's in the back of the trunk!

892
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:29,270
We gotta go get out!

893
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:30,910
Oh!

894
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,510
Oh!

895
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:32,730
Oh my God!

896
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,230
Oh my God!

897
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,470
I'll be a hero!

898
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,230
I see it!

899
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:36,530
Go!

900
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,550
They can't stop all of us!

901
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,230
No, I think they can.

902
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,130
They could.

903
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:42,530
Yeah.

904
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:49,910
Okay, I'm okay.

905
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:50,510
Oh my God!

906
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,790
That scared the shit out of me.

907
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:54,830
Did you get it?

908
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,930
We got it.

909
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,070
Yay!

910
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,250
Yeah, we gotta take it down to the lab.

911
00:28:59,250 --> 00:28:59,710
Wait, no.

912
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,470
This goes to the roof.

913
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:00,810
Oh my God.

914
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:01,610
He's here?

915
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,630
Wait, that's the rock.

916
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,190
How did we get to the lab?

917
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:04,970
I thought it was this way.

918
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:05,750
It was the other one.

919
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,390
It was the...

920
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:07,930
Other one?

921
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,950
Remember when we had to go to like...

922
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,690
The staircase?

923
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,510
Yellow women?

924
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,090
What...

925
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,550
What was the plan here?

926
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,130
Um...

927
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,890
Look, the yellow women had a little like...

928
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,210
There's a little snafu with the yellow women.

929
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:19,690
Okay?

930
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,850
We had a lot of plans.

931
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,730
We just brought up the wrong plan.

932
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:23,930
Yeah.

933
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,190
Plan A.

934
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,330
Yeah, yeah.

935
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,370
This is plan B.

936
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,970
Now we're going to do plan C.

937
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,130
Oh...

938
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,310
Or plan D.

939
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,390
I should...

940
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,370
Okay.

941
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,290
I'm okay.

942
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,310
You just lost somebody?

943
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,370
Wait, who did we lose?

944
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:41,890
Oh!

945
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,320
It's okay.

946
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,660
It's okay.

947
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:49,980
It's okay.

948
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,240
It's okay.

949
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,380
It's okay.

950
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:50,400
It's okay.

951
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,060
It's okay.

952
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,380
This is all part of plan C.

953
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,660
Plan D for Doki.

954
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,280
Yeah.

955
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,120
There you go.

956
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:55,460
Let's see.

957
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,320
Plan C.

958
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,720
Hey, all according to plan.

959
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,220
Wait, not this way, not this way.

960
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,400
That's not the plan part.

961
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,620
It's just... Slenderman's in there.

962
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,180
Yeah, but this is where we went to the lab, remember?

963
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,160
It was like through these stairs.

964
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,860
Are you wondering if you can't believe it?

965
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,100
I think so, I think so.

966
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,440
Yeah, it was this one, right?

967
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,260
Okay.

968
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,520
Or was it the other side?

969
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,160
Oh, no, here.

970
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,820
We had to go up.

971
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,300
I don't remember what the object was.

972
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:22,720
I don't remember.

973
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,020
Wait, I remember.

974
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,940
We had to go...

975
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,540
We had to go to the basement, remember?

976
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,820
And then take another elevator.

977
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,820
Guys, maybe we shouldn't have waited two weeks to do a part two.

978
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,940
It's a weird...

979
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,000
Wait, I remember.

980
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,860
Wait, it's all coming back to me.

981
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,640
It's right here.

982
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,980
Oh my... Oh my guy!

983
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,280
Where did he come from?

984
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,800
Isn't there a way over here?

985
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

986
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,840
That's all sinking.

987
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,660
That's all sinking.

988
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,740
I... Okay.

989
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,500
Is there a save point in here?

990
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,800
It was like in the elevator, remember?

991
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,600
Where was the elevator?

992
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,760
It was like down here?

993
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,440
Oh yeah, it was down here.

994
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,000
With the plan.

995
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,580
Exactly, I have a plan.

996
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,440
There's a save, there's a save.

997
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,580
It's so dark in here.

998
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,480
There you go.

999
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:23,860
See?

1000
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,480
Hi!

1001
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,200
Alright, and then we take this elevator.

1002
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,660
I'm trying to press the elevator button.

1003
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,920
My item is blocking.

1004
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,520
Okay.

1005
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,500
And then...

1006
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,820
We go to basement two.

1007
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,580
And then we go to another elevator.

1008
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,260
And then we go down.

1009
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,320
I...

1010
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,580
You're saying a lot of shit right now.

1011
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,440
It makes sense to me.

1012
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,120
I get it.

1013
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,440
Yeah, yeah, you just gotta...

1014
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,260
Okay, the thing is...

1015
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,260
I...

1016
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,980
I don't remember which...

1017
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,220
It was this way, right?

1018
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,000
We...

1019
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,700
We don't know where you're trying to...

1020
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,080
I didn't think it was this way.

1021
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:07,900
There's a guy, there's a guy, there's a guy!

1022
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:07,960
There's a guy, there's a guy, there's a guy!

1023
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,760
Oh my God!

1024
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:09,480
Okay.

1025
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,260
Wait.

1026
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,920
Wait, I'm...

1027
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,640
Give me a sec.

1028
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,300
Wasn't it the main elevator and then you select like a different floor?

1029
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,840
No, no, no.

1030
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,660
Cause we had to take two elevators.

1031
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,720
So like, it was from here...

1032
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,120
That we went to a different...

1033
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,840
Oh, I remember!

1034
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,500
Cause we...

1035
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,680
We went to the...

1036
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,560
You said, I remember like five times.

1037
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,360
Remember when we had to run past the other guy?

1038
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,540
To get to the...

1039
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,500
This would have happened if Rafe was here.

1040
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,880
Oh, see, Doobie remembers!

1041
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,740
My fellow yellow woman remembers.

1042
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,440
We have to run past this guy.

1043
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,840
There's a guy over here, by the way.

1044
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,160
I don't think we run that way, but...

1045
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,300
Was it this way?

1046
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,680
No, it was this way.

1047
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,660
Guys, guys, see, I remembered.

1048
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,700
I...

1049
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,220
And then we go this way.

1050
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,640
Let's see, look!

1051
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,400
Remember this guy!

1052
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,300
We saw him!

1053
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,580
Yeah, yeah.

1054
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,340
See?

1055
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,900
I knew I remember...

1056
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,260
And then basement too!

1057
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,900
I think they're dead.

1058
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,080
So I...

1059
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,220
I think so.

1060
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,020
I don't think they're alive.

1061
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,520
I think we...

1062
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,080
We'll have to leave them.

1063
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:25,660
It's okay.

1064
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,800
It's for the...

1065
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,720
It's okay.

1066
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,240
We're heroes.

1067
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,920
Aren't we supposed to have, like, survivor's guilt or something?

1068
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,960
It's okay, not when you're a hero.

1069
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,540
Okay, no, no guilt at all.

1070
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,500
No guilt.

1071
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,160
Because we're doing it for the greater good.

1072
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,660
Their sacrifice...

1073
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,240
Their sacrifice will be remembered.

1074
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:50,720
And then...

1075
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,060
And then...

1076
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:52,880
Boom!

1077
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
We did it!

1078
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:54,840
See?

1079
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,740
No, no, no.

1080
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,920
No, that's just...

1081
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,600
That's just guilt.

1082
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,220
That's just guilt.

1083
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,700
You gotta stop feeling guilty, Nimi.

1084
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,620
Okay, I'll forget about them.

1085
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,060
I'll have to go.

1086
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,160
Alright.

1087
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,580
As...

1088
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,240
As the moment you forgot about...

1089
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,340
Forget about them...

1090
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,340
You'll feel so much better.

1091
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,960
The weight will lift on your shoulders.

1092
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,740
It wasn't your fault, Nimi.

1093
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,260
It was their fault.

1094
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,600
Yeah, because they weren't heroes.

1095
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,330
Yeah, because they didn't follow...

1096
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,280
Follow us, you know?

1097
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,600
Yeah, they should have followed us.

1098
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,900
We knew what we were doing.

1099
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:31,340
Yeah.

1100
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,320
So it was their fault.

1101
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,840
Alright, we opened the hatch.

1102
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:36,680
See?

1103
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,660
Plan C worked, Nimi.

1104
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:39,560
Okay.

1105
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,800
It seems like the moon is not floating away.

1106
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:43,860
Yeah, because...

1107
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,520
We have to open the second hatch.

1108
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,800
So there's two hatches.

1109
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,360
Okay, basement two.

1110
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,540
You think the moon was made out of helium, you know?

1111
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:00,180
I'm telling you, it's gonna float up there like a party city balloon.

1112
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,020
Oh, wait!

1113
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:01,980
You're alive!

1114
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,580
What happened to...

1115
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,280
Oh, oh, okay.

1116
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,040
Okay.

1117
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,340
See, you followed the wrong yellow woman.

1118
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,920
I told you I had a plan.

1119
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,540
There's no loyalty here?

1120
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,820
No, okay.

1121
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,000
The yellow car plan was my plan.

1122
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,080
She's in charge of the other plan.

1123
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,740
So...

1124
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,380
What was the other plan?

1125
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,240
The other plan was the...

1126
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,220
You didn't even know where the yellow car was.

1127
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,160
I found the yellow car!

1128
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,320
What do you mean?

1129
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,620
I was a hero!

1130
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,800
For the record, I've had survivor's guilt this whole time.

1131
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,740
No, she did.

1132
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,760
She forgot about you.

1133
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,940
She freaking...

1134
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,940
For the record, I could always hear your voice.

1135
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,500
Yeah, I was talking.

1136
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,780
I could hear you guys, too.

1137
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,400
Okay, we gotta...

1138
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,920
We gotta go revive the other yellow woman because she actually has the...

1139
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,800
She has the...

1140
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,360
The part two of this plan.

1141
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,760
Oh, okay.

1142
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,440
I was only...

1143
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,920
Wait, what did you guys do down there?

1144
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,820
Oh, we opened the hatch for the moon.

1145
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,080
Yeah, yeah.

1146
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,160
We just need to open the second hatch, but...

1147
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,220
The second yellow woman has part two.

1148
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,820
I was only part one.

1149
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:11,920
Okay.

1150
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:11,960
Okay.

1151
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,000
Alright.

1152
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,740
So how did she die?

1153
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,520
So we could avoid that.

1154
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,000
The guy got her.

1155
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,400
And where is this...

1156
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,520
And where is this guy you speak of?

1157
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,860
Mr. Slenderman!

1158
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,440
We could just jump, right?

1159
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,140
Oh, no.

1160
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,900
No, I don't...

1161
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,020
No, we have to go through the guy.

1162
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,900
So...

1163
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,740
Ladies first.

1164
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,260
I think if you just run for it...

1165
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,680
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1166
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,620
Oh, he'll only get one of us.

1167
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,720
He'll only get one of us.

1168
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,060
Wrong elevator!

1169
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:45,800
Wrong elevator!

1170
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,570
He can't even come in here.

1171
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,070
Nice, I was waiting for you guys.

1172
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,850
With the door closed?

1173
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,150
Yeah, for safety.

1174
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:14,910
When would you see someone coming down the hall, and you're in the hallway with the door closed, but...

1175
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,490
I'm just...

1176
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,330
I'm just trying to save energy.

1177
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:17,790
Same!

1178
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,290
Doobie, it's your turn for part two.

1179
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:21,950
Part two of the plan.

1180
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:22,390
All right.

1181
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,530
All right, but you guys have fun of me.

1182
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,510
I'm not doing the plan.

1183
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,850
No, no, I was just saying...

1184
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,170
I heard you.

1185
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,370
No, I was saying that...

1186
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,550
I was part...

1187
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:40,650
Okay, maybe that was karma.

1188
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,370
You can't come in here!

1189
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,520
No, please no.

1190
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,920
Okay, so...

1191
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,920
Who was it?

1192
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,940
Who was the...

1193
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
Who said...

1194
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:06,440
Who said...

1195
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,460
That was my revenge.

1196
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,440
That might have been deserved.

1197
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,880
He was like, you can't come over here.

1198
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,440
How do we get back to like the annex anyways?

1199
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,460
It's the...

1200
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,080
Up there.

1201
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,880
We have to go out.

1202
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,960
Yeah, we have to go outside.

1203
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,940
Watch out for him.

1204
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,220
He's a sneaky one, that guy.

1205
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,020
We'll just...

1206
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,520
Yeah, that was very...

1207
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:28,800
He's there.

1208
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,220
He's there.

1209
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:29,540
He's there.

1210
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,880
We can walk around him!

1211
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,680
I knew it.

1212
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,360
I'm a hero.

1213
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,640
I just had to walk around.

1214
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:38,840
I just had to walk around.

1215
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,620
We just had...

1216
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,900
I just had to wait for them to die.

1217
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,680
Alright.

1218
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,920
I just had to wait.

1219
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,140
I just had to wait until...

1220
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,360
Don't worry.

1221
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,120
Wait.

1222
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,740
Someone else is...

1223
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,000
Wait.

1224
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,620
Someone else is on the other side?

1225
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,280
Wait.

1226
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,920
Um...

1227
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,480
Excuse me.

1228
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,440
I'm closer to the objective.

1229
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,340
So the other person has to die.

1230
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,140
Not me.

1231
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,040
I'm literally closest to the objective.

1232
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,860
What do you mean?

1233
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,440
I'm literally here, where we're supposed to be.

1234
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,180
Okay, no, they have to die, not me.

1235
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,460
It's 2v1.

1236
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,260
I don't know that.

1237
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,820
It could be 1v1, for all I know.

1238
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:02,620
I'm literally next to the objective, so if anything, they should come to me.

1239
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,080
Wait, I hear them!

1240
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:08,620
Hello?

1241
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,680
Hello?

1242
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,480
Hello?

1243
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,500
Are they lost?

1244
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,640
Oh my god, are they lost?

1245
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,400
Did anything not figure out where to go?

1246
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,600
Hello?

1247
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,360
Marco?

1248
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:31,900
Marco?

1249
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:38,910
No, I'm literally on part 2 of Plan C.

1250
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,770
This is part 2 of Plan C.

1251
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,570
They just have to head here.

1252
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,210
Wait, how are they at the very beginning?

1253
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:48,530
Marco?

1254
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:48,610
Hello?

1255
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,490
Oh my god, there they are!

1256
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,190
Okay, don't worry.

1257
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,150
I know where to go.

1258
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,550
I was waiting for you guys.

1259
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,050
Okay.

1260
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,410
We need Doobie, though.

1261
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1262
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,970
There's a safe station right here.

1263
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:06,030
So this is part 2 of Plan C.

1264
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,010
Okay.

1265
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:07,870
All right.

1266
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,470
All right, Doobie.

1267
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:11,870
It's your turn to shine.

1268
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,150
Okay, follow me.

1269
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:15,770
Our leader.

1270
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,010
Oh, no.

1271
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:19,110
She had to research part 2.

1272
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,810
And I was... Oh, the guy's right there.

1273
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,630
We gotta... Oh, I hear him!

1274
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,070
I hear him!

1275
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:23,990
Okay, don't worry.

1276
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,050
I'll bait them.

1277
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:25,990
I'll be a hero.

1278
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,570
Oh my god.

1279
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,830
Oh my god.

1280
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:32,510
Oh my god.

1281
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:33,890
That's right.

1282
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,270
Don't worry.

1283
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,330
I got this, guys.

1284
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,190
Oh!

1285
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,450
Wait, where did he go?

1286
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,890
Wait, where did he go?

1287
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,330
Guys, I lost him!

1288
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,610
You lost him?

1289
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:50,970
Guys, I lost him!

1290
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,050
I don't know where he went!

1291
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,370
Hello.

1292
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:53,830
Oh, hey.

1293
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,390
Oh, hang on.

1294
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,370
I don't know where he went.

1295
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:55,370
I don't know where he went.

1296
00:41:55,410 --> 00:42:00,370
Hey, I'm looking for the room that has all the canisters down here that we did when we first did this.

1297
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:01,190
Oh.

1298
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,070
The room with green lines.

1299
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:04,270
Oh.

1300
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,630
I didn't research that part.

1301
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:07,530
I left it to you.

1302
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,070
No, no, no, no.

1303
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,170
It's already a part that we did.

1304
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,290
It's just I need to find it.

1305
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:16,890
Isn't it too- isn't it for up there to the right and then left?

1306
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,690
No, it's right to the left.

1307
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:19,350
Ah!

1308
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:20,470
There he is!

1309
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,190
Oh, I found it!

1310
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:21,870
I found it!

1311
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,690
Okay, so we have to take these upstairs.

1312
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,070
Wait, we have to take these upstairs?

1313
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:26,370
Okay.

1314
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:27,430
Alright.

1315
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:28,890
Yeah.

1316
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:28,990
Yeah.

1317
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,230
Um, he's right there?

1318
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:30,790
He's here!

1319
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,570
Oh, he is!

1320
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:33,770
Oh, don't worry!

1321
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:34,710
It's like dead by daylight!

1322
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,230
Got you guys!

1323
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,130
Okay, he's coming back!

1324
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:41,910
Okay, she's dead.

1325
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,350
Who's dead?

1326
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,970
Um, she's dead.

1327
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,510
Alright, this is it!

1328
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,330
This is dead by daylight!

1329
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,510
Right here!

1330
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,740
Okay, that's- I got you.

1331
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,480
I'm a hero.

1332
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:08,470
Where'd he go?

1333
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:08,710
Okay.

1334
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:09,690
Okay.

1335
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,670
I'll just bait him.

1336
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:11,830
Okay.

1337
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,470
Guys, push the thing!

1338
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:15,190
He's on me!

1339
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:17,990
Okay.

1340
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:19,420
Well...

1341
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:20,350
What?

1342
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,010
Where did- Where did she come from?

1343
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:33,370
Where- Where did she come- Where did she come- Where did- Wait, what?

1344
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:38,870
Where- Where did she even come from?

1345
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:43,890
Hello?

1346
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,810
I'm here.

1347
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:47,330
Hi.

1348
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:48,050
Hello.

1349
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:48,850
He just walked that way.

1350
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:49,570
He just walked that way.

1351
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:50,250
Oh, wait.

1352
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:51,230
Have you just been hiding there?

1353
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:52,070
The entire time?

1354
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:53,890
Not the entire time.

1355
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:54,770
I just hid here now.

1356
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,390
Why'd you shut the door?

1357
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:01,590
I'm trying to put... Okay, I think Mimi and Doobie are dead, so we have to go back.

1358
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:02,610
Okay.

1359
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,250
Bye-bye Mimi.

1360
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,570
Get me out of here.

1361
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,410
I'm pretty sure they're dead.

1362
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:11,930
I think so too.

1363
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:13,730
Hello!

1364
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:14,850
Oh, yes, alright.

1365
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,370
I pushed it a little bit.

1366
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:17,990
I know where to loop her.

1367
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,550
I think there's an easier way to go upstairs.

1368
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:21,730
It's like right by the room.

1369
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,390
Yeah, it's right here.

1370
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,030
It's right here.

1371
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,490
And then you push it from here.

1372
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:29,150
Is he over there?

1373
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:29,910
I don't know.

1374
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:31,950
But it's right here.

1375
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,250
This is where you push upstairs.

1376
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,130
I hear him.

1377
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:34,570
He's here.

1378
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:35,010
He's here.

1379
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:35,230
Oh!

1380
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:37,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1381
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:38,770
We gotta bring the janitor right here.

1382
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:39,190
Yeah.

1383
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:39,190
Okay.

1384
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:40,350
What do we got?

1385
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,610
Okay, he's chasing the green women.

1386
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:43,250
Oh.

1387
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:43,650
Take it off.

1388
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:45,210
Take it off.

1389
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,430
Alright, I'll... we're going for it.

1390
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:48,390
Oh my god, oh my god.

1391
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,750
Oh my god, push this... this way.

1392
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,150
Okay, I'm pushing.

1393
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:53,470
I'm pushing.

1394
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:54,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1395
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:55,890
Greens, do your job.

1396
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:57,530
Okay.

1397
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,550
Wait, where is he?

1398
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:02,770
Oh!

1399
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:03,330
Oh!

1400
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:03,890
Okay.

1401
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:05,370
Mimi, you got him?

1402
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:07,090
Alright.

1403
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,010
Is she alive?

1404
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:13,870
Okay, I'm pushing it up.

1405
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:21,550
There's two more canisters, man!

1406
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:22,270
Push those!

1407
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,380
I got one of them upstairs.

1408
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,080
Okay.

1409
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,840
But I don't know where to go after that.

1410
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,200
Oh.

1411
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,000
Okay.

1412
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,520
Is that all of them?

1413
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,600
Nope, there's no...

1414
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:41,840
Oh.

1415
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,220
Yeah, there we go.

1416
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:42,940
Okay.

1417
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:43,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1418
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:47,840
Okay.

1419
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,020
Okay, wait, wait.

1420
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,340
Let's see if Mimi is...

1421
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:51,380
Oh.

1422
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,040
Hey!

1423
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,000
What the hell?

1424
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,300
Wait, Doobie, let's see if Mimi died or not.

1425
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,080
Because I don't think she's alive.

1426
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,280
What?

1427
00:45:59,380 --> 00:45:59,920
Are we gonna save?

1428
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:00,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1429
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,980
Yeah, I think it'd be good too.

1430
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,300
Yeah, I had a feeling she was dead.

1431
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,220
Alright.

1432
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,260
Let's follow Doobie.

1433
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,920
Her sacrifice is not in there.

1434
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,100
Alright, so...

1435
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:09,880
What I...

1436
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,600
Realize...

1437
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,120
He ha...

1438
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,600
It like pushes the monster away.

1439
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:13,620
Oh!

1440
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,400
Nice.

1441
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,440
He teched.

1442
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:15,900
So...

1443
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,600
Hopefully that guy doesn't come up here and then we just push these into the right spot.

1444
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,260
Okay, I'll grab this one.

1445
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,720
It might go backwards, though.

1446
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:29,050
Um...

1447
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:29,370
Okay.

1448
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:30,770
I'm scared.

1449
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,490
Wait, where are we supposed to go?

1450
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,610
Somebody should get in between the canisters and then...

1451
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:37,690
Yeah, yeah, I'm in between it.

1452
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,630
Wait, actually, you should be in for it and I'll be back.

1453
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:40,630
Cause...

1454
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:41,630
Cause you know where to go.

1455
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:42,550
Ah, he's coming!

1456
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:56,650
Look!

1457
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:57,510
Shoot!

1458
00:46:57,850 --> 00:46:58,130
Oh gosh.

1459
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:01,190
I'm panicking.

1460
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:02,750
I'm panicking.

1461
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,890
I don't think they know where...

1462
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:06,850
They don't know where they are.

1463
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:07,790
They're still alive.

1464
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:09,070
This way is the safe place.

1465
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:10,670
Yeah, yeah.

1466
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:14,250
Hello, we're back.

1467
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:17,010
Okay, it only works in the hallway, I guess.

1468
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:17,590
Okay.

1469
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:18,330
Okay.

1470
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:19,770
We'll wait for him to pass.

1471
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:20,650
Then we'll go back.

1472
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:21,710
Okay.

1473
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:23,470
Go for that guy.

1474
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:24,350
Okay.

1475
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,190
Someone has to bait him out of here.

1476
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:30,270
I saw you.

1477
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:32,890
I saw him run fastest!

1478
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:35,330
Alright.

1479
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,240
Let's go.

1480
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,260
Somebody lead him away.

1481
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,180
Probably not me cause my shift key is not working.

1482
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:42,260
Okay.

1483
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,520
Yeah, someone, I need to push this.

1484
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,380
He's here!

1485
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:45,700
He's here!

1486
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,180
Okay, okay, guys.

1487
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,360
Finally, we gotta lead him away!

1488
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,620
Oh, it's okay.

1489
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,380
He's trapped too.

1490
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,280
Oh no.

1491
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:54,680
It's okay.

1492
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,220
It's just mid!

1493
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:57,800
Ah!

1494
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,080
Okay, that was...

1495
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,500
I would say that that was on me.

1496
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,280
That was on...

1497
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,500
That was karma.

1498
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,120
Right there.

1499
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,980
That was 100% karma.

1500
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,940
I believe, I believe in Doobie.

1501
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,240
Alright, round two!

1502
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,380
Round two!

1503
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,360
One of the canisters is in there.

1504
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:30,700
Okay.

1505
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:31,660
We did it!

1506
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,340
Alright, I'm pushing it with you.

1507
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,800
Where do we push the other one?

1508
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,760
Push, push, push, push.

1509
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,140
I think we have to go...

1510
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,100
I see a red line, yeah.

1511
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:41,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1512
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,660
I'll go for that one.

1513
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:44,240
Okay.

1514
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:46,680
Is that this side?

1515
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,340
Is it...

1516
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,500
It's over here in this corner.

1517
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,440
Oh, over here.

1518
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,740
No, no, there's one more over here.

1519
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,540
No, no, no, it's this way, it's this way.

1520
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:53,980
Go this way?

1521
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:54,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1522
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:57,600
Okay.

1523
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:58,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1524
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:58,480
Oh, yeah, see?

1525
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,040
We got it!

1526
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:00,440
Ayy!

1527
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,320
Yeah, ayy!

1528
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,020
Last one's here, last one's here.

1529
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,880
Oh, I hear, I hear.

1530
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,320
Yo, yo, yo!

1531
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,580
I believe, I believe.

1532
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:10,460
Yay!

1533
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,260
Wee-hoo!

1534
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,000
Wee-hoo!

1535
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:13,580
Wee-hoo!

1536
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,020
Yeah, let's go save.

1537
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:15,420
Okay.

1538
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,320
Go save, go save!

1539
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,340
I've got the dynamite!

1540
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,280
Let's get in here, I forgot.

1541
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,480
Uh, you can go this way.

1542
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,260
No, no, no!

1543
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,420
We do not go that way.

1544
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,120
We do not go that way!

1545
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,380
Is it this way?

1546
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,660
Yeah, I think it's this way.

1547
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,780
Is this the dead end?

1548
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,200
Oh wait, I can place it now.

1549
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:36,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1550
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,780
Maybe there's a save point over there.

1551
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,720
Oh... Oh nice, nice, nice, nice!

1552
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,720
There's gotta be a save point right here.

1553
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,620
Oh yeah, there is!

1554
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,480
Wait, we have a gun?

1555
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,780
No, it's COVID.

1556
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,420
Okay, Mimi's still alive.

1557
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:57,720
Oh.

1558
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,360
Because we all saw Mint die.

1559
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,380
Yeah, yeah.

1560
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:02,580
Yes.

1561
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,120
This stuff doesn't kill us?

1562
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:04,900
No, no.

1563
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,840
It's where the orange or the COVID orbs.

1564
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,280
Hello?

1565
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,240
Oh, yes.

1566
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,280
All right, now we can get... Wait, is this a new area?

1567
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:12,940
Yeah, new area.

1568
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:13,740
Yeah, new area.

1569
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,000
I don't know what to do past here, but we'll figure it out.

1570
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:18,840
I... I... Remembers.

1571
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:19,200
Oh.

1572
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:19,560
Oh.

1573
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,560
Whoa.

1574
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,420
Oh, it's your wife, Mint.

1575
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,200
Right, she's... Oh my gosh.

1576
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,360
Stranger lady.

1577
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,140
Yeah, read us the dialogue for us.

1578
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,400
You actually made it.

1579
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,840
That horned beast had it out for you, a real nasty piece of work.

1580
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,180
And don't even get me started on that worm.

1581
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,180
Woodworm.

1582
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:42,240
Woodworm.

1583
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:43,800
Yeah, Woodworm.

1584
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,480
Yeah, Woodworm.

1585
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,180
Good job not dying.

1586
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,640
Yeah, we totally didn't die.

1587
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,320
Zero deaths, guys.

1588
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,220
Oh, that's all.

1589
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,580
Oh, oh, really?

1590
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,180
That was not very informative.

1591
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:55,820
Zero deaths, zero deaths.

1592
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,700
All right, that was my plan and that's all I got.

1593
00:50:59,440 --> 00:50:59,960
What do you have?

1594
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,780
Wait, he has no head.

1595
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,220
Oh, no.

1596
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,260
Wait, I think we can put something here, no?

1597
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:10,640
Is that the alien from the, you know, the Mexico alien?

1598
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,380
Yeah, the...

1599
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:20,760
I bet if we swap the other team you guys had with an orange, we could give this guy the...

1600
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,600
Yeah, we give him the orange.

1601
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:27,020
All right, there has to be...

1602
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:27,580
Oh.

1603
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:29,940
What does this say?

1604
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:30,420
Loosed.

1605
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,480
Loosed?

1606
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:31,820
Okay.

1607
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,080
Um, so we don't have a part three of this plan.

1608
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,160
That was the extent of our research.

1609
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:37,920
Yeah.

1610
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,380
We have to find the electrical box.

1611
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,180
That's all I know.

1612
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,600
We're almost done.

1613
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,620
Oh, this is that one area we've got.

1614
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,380
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1615
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:45,140
This is...

1616
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,440
So this is...

1617
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,660
This area is the new area.

1618
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:51,680
I wonder if we have to take the canisters from up there, down here, probably.

1619
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,460
No, we haven't fully explored this area, though.

1620
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,140
Wait, there's another TV with no head.

1621
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,160
Yeah.

1622
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:57,920
There's...

1623
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,640
Yeah.

1624
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,100
I think this is where we came from.

1625
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,160
Uh, yeah.

1626
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:02,740
Do we go to the...

1627
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,100
Is there another area here?

1628
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,600
Okay, it's closed on the other side.

1629
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,320
There'd be...

1630
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:10,920
To the right?

1631
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,260
Do we explore everything?

1632
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,480
We didn't think we'd make it this far.

1633
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,280
Not gonna lie.

1634
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:24,100
We...

1635
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,760
I did not think this far.

1636
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:29,440
Oh, no.

1637
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,120
Hello.

1638
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:32,540
Um...

1639
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,760
Do we explore everything in...

1640
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,420
In this area?

1641
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:36,700
I...

1642
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,200
Feel like there's something we missed.

1643
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,520
Yeah, I think we missed an area.

1644
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,360
I'm pretty sure.

1645
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,320
Where's the second floor?

1646
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,260
Is this the second floor?

1647
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:45,390
Do we go this way?

1648
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:46,710
Yeah, this is the second floor.

1649
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:47,990
Wait, we didn't go this way, guys.

1650
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:49,190
Oh, yeah.

1651
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:49,890
Over here.

1652
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:50,350
Yeah.

1653
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:51,830
Oh, my gosh.

1654
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:52,630
The warms scared me.

1655
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:53,890
Okay.

1656
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:54,650
Oh, okay.

1657
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:55,130
Nothing here.

1658
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:56,450
It's just an empty room.

1659
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,310
There's so many rooms here.

1660
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:00,770
Oh, this is a...

1661
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:01,690
Oh, this is a circle.

1662
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:02,310
This is a circle.

1663
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,090
Oh, we opened...

1664
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:03,350
Oh, yeah.

1665
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:04,270
We need the gun.

1666
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:06,730
We should go to the...

1667
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:07,770
Oh, we gotta go...

1668
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:08,930
Go to the third floor.

1669
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:10,710
Wait, isn't that other area that opened up?

1670
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:12,270
We could go back.

1671
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:15,130
Let's get to the third floor and grab the gun.

1672
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:15,790
Maybe we should save that one.

1673
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:16,350
Yeah, yeah.

1674
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:16,950
Okay.

1675
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:17,830
Grab gun.

1676
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:18,370
Save him?

1677
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:18,890
Okay.

1678
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:19,950
We go here.

1679
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:21,730
There's a gun on the third floor?

1680
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:22,330
Yeah, yeah.

1681
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:23,050
The vending machine?

1682
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:24,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1683
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:25,690
See?

1684
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,450
We're sinking with portals now.

1685
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:29,470
Why is this guy here, though?

1686
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:30,350
I'm scared of him.

1687
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:31,790
I think he, like, came from...

1688
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:32,290
Where...

1689
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:33,490
Where did he go?

1690
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:34,630
By the...

1691
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:36,450
Like, what happened to him?

1692
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,590
Yeah, um...

1693
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,590
You get the gun, and I'll grab the lamp.

1694
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:43,950
Okay.

1695
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:45,550
Alright.

1696
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:46,270
Don't worry.

1697
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:47,790
I'll light our paths now.

1698
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:51,090
We got this, guys.

1699
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:53,050
We're gonna save the moon.

1700
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:54,870
We're gonna save the moon.

1701
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:58,070
We need our tidal waves.

1702
00:53:58,430 --> 00:53:59,130
The other side.

1703
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:00,330
This way.

1704
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:01,370
Yeah, all the way to the end.

1705
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:02,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1706
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:02,910
Don't worry.

1707
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:04,070
I'm lighting the path.

1708
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,130
Oh my god, that's scary.

1709
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:08,090
You guys forgot that was...

1710
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:08,290
What?

1711
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:08,530
What?

1712
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:10,170
I thought someone just died!

1713
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:10,650
Right below!

1714
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,530
It was so dark.

1715
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:16,010
Oh my god!

1716
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:16,650
Oh, nice.

1717
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:19,590
Wait, there's a little hole here.

1718
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,310
Go in there.

1719
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:22,930
Yeah, go in this little hole.

1720
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:24,650
Maybe it'll be a safe hole.

1721
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:26,690
Oh, there's more stairs here.

1722
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,330
It's over on this side.

1723
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:31,810
Orange heads cannot hear.

1724
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:32,690
Oh!

1725
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:33,930
Oh!

1726
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:35,530
So they can't...

1727
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:35,890
It's the orange head.

1728
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:36,530
It's the...

1729
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:37,410
It's the orbs.

1730
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:38,250
The COVID orbs.

1731
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:39,570
Oh!

1732
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,390
Wait, why is the...

1733
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:41,410
Why is that guy here?

1734
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:43,150
Oh, there's a TV here!

1735
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:44,350
I found a TV here!

1736
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:44,570
Oh!

1737
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:45,450
Put it on his head!

1738
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:46,430
Put it on his head!

1739
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:47,670
Where is he?

1740
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:49,510
He's on the bottom floor.

1741
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:51,510
I mean, the next floor.

1742
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:52,790
Here, this way, this way.

1743
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:53,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1744
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:53,790
Yeah.

1745
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:55,770
You lead the way.

1746
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:57,330
We can...

1747
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,030
Okay, watch out.

1748
00:54:59,190 --> 00:54:59,750
Oh, yeah.

1749
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:01,250
Oh.

1750
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:01,730
We can go for him.

1751
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:02,550
Oh, uh...

1752
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:02,910
Over here?

1753
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:04,410
Yeah, yeah, there he is.

1754
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:05,210
Here's one.

1755
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:07,390
Talk to us.

1756
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:08,070
Hello.

1757
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:10,290
Hello, guys.

1758
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:10,670
He's alive!

1759
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:12,690
We did it.

1760
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:13,790
Oh, he's sad.

1761
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:14,830
He's happy.

1762
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:15,230
Yeah.

1763
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:16,290
Oh, hello?

1764
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:16,890
Excuse me.

1765
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:17,670
You said, oh.

1766
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:18,910
Hey.

1767
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:20,030
Hey.

1768
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:20,390
Hey, hi.

1769
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:22,950
It seems you're not infected.

1770
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,310
The little black liquid creatures didn't catch you.

1771
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:29,590
But I remember the times before the moon was brought here.

1772
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:31,670
Back then, there were no creatures.

1773
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:33,890
Everything was just empty.

1774
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:35,210
Oh.

1775
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:35,990
Oh.

1776
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:36,250
Oh.

1777
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:36,750
Oh.

1778
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:36,770
Oh.

1779
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:38,630
He's gone.

1780
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:40,430
So the moon is evil.

1781
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,070
The moon is evil.

1782
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:43,730
We should save.

1783
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:44,670
Yeah, we should save.

1784
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:45,570
Okay, right here.

1785
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:46,330
Wait, wait, wait.

1786
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:46,710
Not here.

1787
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,270
I'm spreading misinformation.

1788
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:50,130
Okay.

1789
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:51,990
Alright, let's go back to the...

1790
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:53,330
You're not a little creature, though.

1791
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,650
Let's go back to that area.

1792
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:56,950
Wait, is it this way or the other way?

1793
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:58,150
I think it was the other way, right?

1794
00:55:58,790 --> 00:55:59,190
Yeah.

1795
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:00,210
Yeah, it was this way.

1796
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:01,470
It was the shortcut.

1797
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:02,090
Hi.

1798
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:02,810
Hi.

1799
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:06,070
That's okay.

1800
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:07,950
Yeah, this was another area I opened.

1801
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,810
But I think it's the place we've been before.

1802
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:10,210
Yeah.

1803
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:12,550
And then...

1804
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:15,090
We go...

1805
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:16,930
Oh, do you hear that?

1806
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,130
Do we drop down?

1807
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:20,970
Oh!

1808
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:23,150
Why not?

1809
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:24,290
Uh...

1810
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:27,270
You can go up the stairs if you go that way to the...

1811
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:29,030
Where's the stairs?

1812
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:30,390
How do I get back?

1813
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,230
Wait, where are we before?

1814
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:33,850
Wait, what you said?

1815
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:35,270
Was there almost an elevator here?

1816
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:36,490
I don't remember.

1817
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:37,030
I...

1818
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:38,350
I'm so lost.

1819
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:40,950
I don't know.

1820
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,030
Wait, where are the stairs?

1821
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:45,910
I don't...

1822
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,070
Where does this go to?

1823
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:49,210
Oh, it's the laboratory.

1824
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:50,630
Oh, they went the right way.

1825
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:52,050
Wait, how do we get back?

1826
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:53,930
They said there were stairs.

1827
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,390
We lied to.

1828
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:56,690
How do we get back?

1829
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:59,910
Guys, we don't know where the stairs are.

1830
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:02,290
Wait, is this like the very beginning?

1831
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:03,510
Yeah, I remember this.

1832
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:03,870
Yeah.

1833
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:04,770
This is it.

1834
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:05,250
Is it?

1835
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:05,870
Yeah.

1836
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:06,090
Yeah.

1837
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:07,290
Remember we did the...

1838
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,010
Wait, yeah.

1839
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:09,850
I don't think this is it.

1840
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:10,510
Wait.

1841
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:11,690
Wait.

1842
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:12,430
What?

1843
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:14,570
The only...

1844
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,230
The only way forward is...

1845
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:17,470
Is death.

1846
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:18,250
If we die...

1847
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:20,670
If we die, they'll revive us.

1848
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:21,630
I believe in them.

1849
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:23,190
Actually, we don't know where...

1850
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,120
Actually, we don't know where...

1851
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,200
They don't know where the safe point is.

1852
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,700
Weren't they just at the safe point?

1853
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,940
Oh no, where did they go?

1854
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,680
We can't even die!

1855
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:36,740
Oh no!

1856
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,860
This game won't even let us die!

1857
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,400
Okay.

1858
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,300
Maybe...

1859
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:43,660
Oh!

1860
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,300
Maybe it's the other way that we didn't go.

1861
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,200
I believe in this, Nini.

1862
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,680
Yeah, there was...

1863
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,340
There, there, there!

1864
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:52,740
They found it!

1865
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:53,160
They found it!

1866
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:53,260
They found it!

1867
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:53,960
Okay, we have to die.

1868
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:54,400
Okay.

1869
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,760
Wait, this way...

1870
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,120
Maybe?

1871
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,580
Did you find it?

1872
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,120
Oh!

1873
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,160
That's where we can die!

1874
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:05,400
Sweet!

1875
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:05,920
Oh!

1876
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:11,100
You came after me!

1877
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,320
Okay.

1878
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,860
Wait, it's only two of me.

1879
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:15,620
Wait.

1880
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:16,780
Oh!

1881
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,040
One of the players should die.

1882
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:18,420
Yay!

1883
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:19,360
We did it!

1884
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:20,480
Yay!

1885
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,340
We did it!

1886
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,080
Oh my gosh!

1887
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,140
Okay, you guys figured it out.

1888
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:24,600
Covid.

1889
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,380
He's here.

1890
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,100
There's another guy over here.

1891
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:27,840
So be careful.

1892
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,080
Okay.

1893
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,260
One of us leads them away.

1894
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:31,220
Alright.

1895
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:32,580
Wait, wait.

1896
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:32,920
There's a door!

1897
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:33,240
There's a door!

1898
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:33,480
Doobie!

1899
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:33,680
Doobie!

1900
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:33,860
Doobie!

1901
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:33,940
Doobie!

1902
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:34,760
Right here!

1903
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:36,920
Oh!

1904
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,300
Oh my gosh.

1905
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:37,700
It's scary.

1906
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:40,200
Wish I could smash those orange heads.

1907
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,100
Oh!

1908
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,020
That's another...

1909
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:42,360
Shortcut?

1910
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,060
Oh!

1911
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:43,720
Oh!

1912
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:48,460
Oh!

1913
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,460
I'm so...

1914
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:50,680
No!

1915
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,780
I've never been here!

1916
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,380
No!

1917
00:58:59,380 --> 00:58:59,560
No!

1918
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,020
No!

1919
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:06,990
It was so close.

1920
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:11,750
Throw that guy!

1921
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:12,110
Throw that guy!

1922
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:14,470
Okay.

1923
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,290
We have to unlock that area again.

1924
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:18,370
Do you have the gun?

1925
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:19,810
Leave it close, right?

1926
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:20,910
Oh yeah.

1927
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:22,350
Yeah, we should leave it close.

1928
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:23,370
Yeah, you're right.

1929
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:24,450
So true!

1930
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:24,750
I have...

1931
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:25,550
I have it.

1932
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:26,470
Oh yeah, nice.

1933
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:27,270
Okay, where do we go?

1934
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:29,670
Oh, this way?

1935
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:30,890
I think there's...

1936
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:32,070
There's like the orange guy.

1937
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:32,970
We gotta sneak faster.

1938
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:33,710
Oh yeah.

1939
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:35,190
Oh yeah, because he can't hear sound.

1940
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:36,130
So we can sneak it.

1941
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:41,310
Oh, I hear that guy breathing on the other side.

1942
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,290
Does that mean he could see us?

1943
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:46,430
Yeah, it will see you.

1944
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:47,230
And he's fast.

1945
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:47,970
He will get you.

1946
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,080
I'm red.

1947
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:00,800
It's okay.

1948
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:01,460
I...

1949
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,940
I...

1950
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:02,520
I...

1951
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,220
I fated them all away from everyone.

1952
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:05,940
It's okay.

1953
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,860
I fated them all away.

1954
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:08,360
Oh!

1955
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:11,000
They got lost!

1956
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,320
They got lost!

1957
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:13,220
Oh!

1958
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,600
Wait, she found the door!

1959
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:16,820
The password is somewhere here.

1960
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,660
The password is somewhere here.

1961
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:24,860
Doofy, no!

1962
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:25,700
We're all dead!

1963
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:26,300
Doofy!

1964
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,600
We're all dead!

1965
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:29,940
Oh, nice!

1966
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,420
Good job, Doofy!

1967
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:32,840
I heard...

1968
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,180
Min's final words was like, Password is somewhere here!

1969
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:38,580
Password?

1970
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,040
Who killed me?

1971
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:40,620
Who's...

1972
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,080
Who's sloppy body?

1973
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:43,820
Okay.

1974
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,760
Our hero, Doofy.

1975
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,040
Oh, it's a...

1976
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,960
We can't look at them too long or the...

1977
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,260
Our fans get angry.

1978
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,840
Alright, Doofy, what's the plan?

1979
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:56,640
Oh...

1980
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,240
Doofy, you're muted!

1981
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,220
Doofy, you're muted!

1982
01:00:59,220 --> 01:00:59,340
No!

1983
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:05,230
The video's muted!

1984
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,830
I couldn't get the plan!

1985
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,480
Oh no!

1986
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:20,980
Oh no!

1987
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,360
We can't get there!

1988
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,060
Min and Doofy are alive!

1989
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,360
Oh, she's gonna open that...

1990
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,100
Door.

1991
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,240
Maybe.

1992
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:36,620
What's Min doing?

1993
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,120
We'll never know what to do.

1994
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,800
Min's just like, please die.

1995
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:53,960
Oh, she's trying to figure out the path.

1996
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,020
Oh, she's so smart.

1997
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:56,840
Go, Doofy, go!

1998
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:04,680
Okay.

1999
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,260
Oh, we just need Min to press that button.

2000
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:08,040
Min!

2001
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,140
We were all dead.

2002
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,440
I'm trapped!

2003
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,500
I'm kinda trapped in here, though.

2004
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:18,060
Wait, I don't think that was the way to go anyway.

2005
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,100
It was back here, right?

2006
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:19,740
Or is it...

2007
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:20,520
Oh wait, no, it was here.

2008
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,640
Doofy, have you found the path?

2009
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:24,480
We gotta just find the password.

2010
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:25,620
In there.

2011
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:30,180
How about like, one of us bait them out, and then the others run around it.

2012
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,560
You can, yeah, you can like, kind of...

2013
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:33,020
Run past them.

2014
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:34,960
Wait, but you know the path!

2015
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:35,880
You know the path!

2016
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:36,820
You know the path!

2017
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:36,840
You know the path!

2018
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:38,560
Ah!

2019
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:39,340
Ah!

2020
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,100
I got a door!

2021
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:50,750
Where am I?

2022
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:53,370
Oh my god, I'm up here.

2023
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:54,470
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

2024
01:02:59,000 --> 01:02:59,320
Okay.

2025
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:03,440
It's fine.

2026
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,100
Everything is fine.

2027
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,140
Hey guys, hey!

2028
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:08,420
Hey!

2029
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:11,080
I opened the door... Wait, is every...

2030
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,400
Wait...

2031
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:12,640
Shoot.

2032
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,200
No.

2033
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:14,920
Okay.

2034
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:16,620
I keep saying that, huh?

2035
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,140
I got...

2036
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,550
Oh, I hear this.

2037
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:26,230
Oh my god, you're fucking on here.

2038
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:28,730
Wait, I found the password!

2039
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:29,530
I found the password!

2040
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:30,230
I found the password!

2041
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:33,860
Five, one!

2042
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:35,440
One!

2043
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:36,940
Okay, guys, take a picture.

2044
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,060
Chat, at chat, take a picture.

2045
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:41,800
What does it say?

2046
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:42,380
Let me see it.

2047
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:45,200
Five, one, one, two, one, five, one.

2048
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:45,920
Holy hell.

2049
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:46,420
One.

2050
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:48,060
Five, one, one.

2051
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:49,060
Okay.

2052
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:52,560
Okay, so, like, where's the safe box, though?

2053
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:53,780
I know where it is.

2054
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:54,280
Oh, okay.

2055
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:57,400
Well, I have seen it with my eyes.

2056
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,300
Okay, it's fine.

2057
01:03:58,380 --> 01:03:59,200
Nimi was a hero.

2058
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,260
She, she's, I don't know if she's dead.

2059
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:01,860
Watch out, watch out.

2060
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:02,600
But she was a hero.

2061
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:03,040
She's dead.

2062
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:06,740
Okay, Nimi, I'm trying to get up!

2063
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:07,360
Okay.

2064
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:08,900
Nimi, I'm trying to get up!

2065
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,340
Alright, let's just, let's just try for it.

2066
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:10,680
Let's just try for it.

2067
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,620
Where are you?

2068
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:13,460
I think I hear her.

2069
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,040
Is this it?

2070
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,460
You're gonna die.

2071
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,360
You're gonna die?

2072
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:22,620
Okay.

2073
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,160
Okay, we'll bring you back.

2074
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:25,900
Oh, shoot.

2075
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,080
Alright, we'll bring you back.

2076
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,260
We found the password.

2077
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:30,920
Nice!

2078
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,720
Yeah, we need to know where the safe, the safe box is, though.

2079
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,900
I, I, I, I...

2080
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,640
I ran past it once.

2081
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:40,280
Is this way too long?

2082
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,440
It's a very long password.

2083
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:44,400
No, it is very, very long.

2084
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:45,960
Watch out, there's a little slime guy.

2085
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,680
As long as we don't look at him, we'll be fine.

2086
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,840
You guys know where the safe box is.

2087
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,460
Min says she knows where it is.

2088
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:53,500
Well...

2089
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:53,960
Oh, guys.

2090
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,400
One at a time, guys!

2091
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:58,060
One at a time, guys!

2092
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,080
There can only be one.

2093
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,720
Wait, I think she...

2094
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:01,980
Did we lose her?

2095
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,240
Did she die?

2096
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,480
No, I don't think so.

2097
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:06,380
Did she?

2098
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:06,820
Oh, yeah.

2099
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:09,880
I saw you two, like, stuff each other.

2100
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,380
Yeah, you two are...

2101
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,060
I didn't see anyone next to me, so...

2102
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:14,380
I couldn't even tell.

2103
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:15,560
Wait, Min, where...

2104
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:16,300
I ran file!

2105
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:17,900
Oh my god!

2106
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:18,520
No,

2107
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,740
he's capping!

2108
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:24,680
That's illegal!

2109
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,280
Wait, I think he's gone over here.

2110
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:26,800
He's gone, he's gone.

2111
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:27,320
Okay.

2112
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,300
No, he's not.

2113
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:29,120
No, he's not.

2114
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:29,980
Go, go, go, go, go!

2115
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,040
One at a time!

2116
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,240
Single file, everybody!

2117
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:33,900
Oh my god!

2118
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:34,320
Oh my god!

2119
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,440
The slime!

2120
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,500
Run from the slime!

2121
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:37,420
Oh my god!

2122
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:40,520
Okay, is this the second floor?

2123
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,780
Wait, no, this is the second floor!

2124
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:42,060
I think so.

2125
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:43,300
This is the second floor.

2126
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:45,560
Is the safe in our...

2127
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,360
in our...

2128
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:46,560
room?

2129
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:48,240
Or...

2130
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:48,940
I've...

2131
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:50,140
We've seen the safe before.

2132
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:50,720
I remember.

2133
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:55,780
There was one next to the map, but it didn't have this many digits.

2134
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,280
There was...

2135
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:01,400
There was something green that I was by, and that's where it said the password is close to here.

2136
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,260
And it was in that room.

2137
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:03,120
Oh, okay.

2138
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:03,780
Where is it?

2139
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:04,440
Think, Min.

2140
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:04,860
Think!

2141
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,920
It was upstairs, in that room, though.

2142
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:08,840
Okay.

2143
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:09,580
Okay, we can do this.

2144
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,640
We just gotta have someone bait the guy again.

2145
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:12,460
Oh!

2146
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,160
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

2147
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:22,620
This is the first floor.

2148
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:23,280
Yeah.

2149
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:24,580
Okay.

2150
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,240
Uh...

2151
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,460
Where was the save point here?

2152
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:27,040
I don't remember.

2153
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,080
Oh my god.

2154
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:30,500
You little bastard.

2155
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,660
Go, go, go, go!

2156
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:35,840
Wait, I remember!

2157
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:38,200
Um...

2158
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:38,700
Oh my gosh.

2159
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:40,080
Uh, over here, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2160
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:40,340
Double kill.

2161
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,400
There was one.

2162
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:43,100
We got two of us.

2163
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:43,820
The very first one we found.

2164
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:45,500
Oh my god, there he is.

2165
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,100
Oh, we're back!

2166
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:46,560
Okay.

2167
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:48,320
Yeah, he double killed us.

2168
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:49,180
Yeah.

2169
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:50,840
Okay, we got...

2170
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,300
I left my password back there.

2171
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,920
It's okay, chat remembers, right chat?

2172
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:57,260
I don't know if we have to...

2173
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:58,120
Okay, I got it.

2174
01:06:58,860 --> 01:06:58,980
Alright.

2175
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,200
Think, guys.

2176
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:00,700
Think.

2177
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:01,900
Where is the save?

2178
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,080
This is the first floor, so we have to go to the second floor.

2179
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,160
Yeah, we have to go back up.

2180
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:05,980
Oh, you're right.

2181
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:06,400
Okay.

2182
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:08,020
I believe in duty.

2183
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,720
I hope this guy is not up here.

2184
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:10,440
I know.

2185
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:12,580
Okay, so where have you seen the save?

2186
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:15,720
It was in this library room somewhere.

2187
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,140
This is where I got the plate.

2188
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,040
I got this here.

2189
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:19,180
Oh.

2190
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:20,080
Okay.

2191
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:22,460
So...

2192
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,040
One of us...

2193
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,660
One of us will remember.

2194
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:29,560
I think we have to go that way.

2195
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,000
Yeah, there's no other way to go.

2196
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:32,620
There's here!

2197
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:34,660
There's here!

2198
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:35,020
There's here!

2199
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:35,300
There's here!

2200
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:35,980
Don't come over here!

2201
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:36,560
Don't come over here!

2202
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:37,080
Where

2203
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:41,630
the fuck is that save?

2204
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:43,110
Oh my god!

2205
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:44,710
Where is it?

2206
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:47,850
Oh, I lost everybody.

2207
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:49,310
But that's okay.

2208
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:50,790
Maybe I'll find the save.

2209
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:51,670
Oh, I found...

2210
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:52,690
Wait, no.

2211
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:54,130
I didn't find it.

2212
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:55,650
I didn't find it.

2213
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:55,890
Wait, no.

2214
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:58,090
Okay, I collected the data.

2215
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:00,930
Hello?

2216
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:05,390
Hello?

2217
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,830
Is everybody alive?

2218
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:12,830
Or is everybody dead?

2219
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:16,210
Hello?

2220
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:16,350
Hello?

2221
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,140
Oh, I don't know.

2222
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,540
I don't know who's alive and who's not.

2223
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,960
I'm so confused.

2224
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,660
Oh my...

2225
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:31,140
Oh, there it is.

2226
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,520
Oh my god.

2227
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:33,580
One of us is alive.

2228
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,720
One of us is still alive.

2229
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:37,660
Hello?

2230
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:38,320
Hello?

2231
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:40,200
Hey.

2232
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:41,180
Where are you?

2233
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:44,080
I'm at the first save point.

2234
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,680
Oh, I'm at...

2235
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,400
The other save point.

2236
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,620
Alright, I'll die or I'll go up there.

2237
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,480
Alright.

2238
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,000
I'm on the...

2239
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,880
I'm like with all the TV people.

2240
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,940
Okay, I'm gonna die.

2241
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,780
Okay, did you find the save?

2242
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:02,920
Guys, did she find it?

2243
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:08,400
Did she find the save?

2244
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:16,370
I don't know if she found it.

2245
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:23,670
Someone is still alive.

2246
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:30,330
Who is still alive?

2247
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:33,830
Please...

2248
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:35,670
Please just die for the cause.

2249
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,550
Just die for us.

2250
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:40,650
Oh, oh, they're dead.

2251
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:41,750
Yay!

2252
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:43,430
Okay.

2253
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,710
Doobie, how did you do that?

2254
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:45,970
Wait, what did...

2255
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:47,430
What did she do?

2256
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,990
I have my face between his cheeks.

2257
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:53,490
Nice.

2258
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:54,630
Okay.

2259
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:55,870
Did you find the save?

2260
01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:56,930
You an alien man's ass.

2261
01:09:58,370 --> 01:09:59,910
I didn't find any save.

2262
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:00,890
What about you?

2263
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:01,970
You guys?

2264
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:03,470
Oh, I didn't find anything.

2265
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:04,650
No, we were dead for a while.

2266
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:05,430
We've been dead for a while.

2267
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:06,430
Okay.

2268
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:09,050
What if somebody stays here so that we can revive?

2269
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:10,350
And then somebody goes...

2270
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:10,970
Oh!

2271
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:12,130
You go!

2272
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:12,950
Alright.

2273
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:15,130
Okay, who wants to be the...

2274
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:16,610
How do you do the emotes again?

2275
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:17,410
I don't remember.

2276
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:18,270
Oh, it's E?

2277
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:19,550
Oh, I have an item on it.

2278
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:20,050
Oh, gee.

2279
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:22,450
I have an item on it.

2280
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:24,330
Oh, gee.

2281
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:26,190
Indian woman with the same bird.

2282
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:29,950
Oh, gee.

2283
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:30,670
Oh, gee.

2284
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:31,510
Oh, gee.

2285
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:33,630
Alright, who wants to be- I will go look for it.

2286
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:34,850
But let me see the thing again.

2287
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:39,070
Alright, who would be the driver of the driver in Phasma-phobia?

2288
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:42,550
I'll sit here because my shift key sometimes doesn't work.

2289
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:44,870
Oh, you gotta get a new keyboard.

2290
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:46,190
Yeah.

2291
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:47,830
Have you heard of the wooden keyboard?

2292
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:49,070
It's pretty good.

2293
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:51,030
You have to?

2294
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2295
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:54,310
I guess you would need it.

2296
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:57,610
Guys, you're going... I think they went the wrong...

2297
01:10:58,190 --> 01:10:59,490
It was supposed to be that.

2298
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:00,730
I thought the library was the other way.

2299
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:01,750
Yeah, I thought the... Oh, no, wait.

2300
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:04,030
It is that way, then you go up the... Is it?

2301
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:05,690
How did I... No, I... Oh, I opened a shortcut.

2302
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:06,570
That's why it's easier.

2303
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:08,430
Oh, yeah.

2304
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:09,170
Yeah, yeah.

2305
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:10,170
That's why I said, guys.

2306
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:11,050
Oh, yeah, over there?

2307
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:11,470
Yeah.

2308
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:12,470
It's over there, I'm pretty sure.

2309
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:13,890
Yeah, they went the...

2310
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:15,530
They definitely went the wrong way, right?

2311
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:18,710
I think it still opens up on that side.

2312
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:20,050
No, they're coming back.

2313
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:21,850
They went the wrong way.

2314
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:22,810
Hey, guys.

2315
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:24,050
Hey, guys.

2316
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,810
Hey, you guys are going the wrong way.

2317
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:28,450
Oh, my God.

2318
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:31,630
Holy shit.

2319
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:37,190
Oh, my God.

2320
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:39,470
Oh, my God.

2321
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:39,510
Oh, my God.

2322
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:42,370
I can't believe what happened in front of me.

2323
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:44,570
Why

2324
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:49,320
is it always Doobie?

2325
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:49,940
Why is it always Doobie?

2326
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:52,200
Why does this always happen to her?

2327
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,660
Oh, my God.

2328
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:57,640
Oh, my God.

2329
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:58,580
Oh,

2330
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,300
my God.

2331
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:04,480
Oh, my God.

2332
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:09,640
The amount of times that's happened to her in the last two parts is actually crazy.

2333
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:12,960
Goodbye, Doobie.

2334
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:15,560
Goodbye, Doobie.

2335
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:16,440
Goodbye.

2336
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:16,820
Goodbye.

2337
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,380
You guys are going the wrong way.

2338
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:20,260
I was like...

2339
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,940
Oh, it's the Doobster.

2340
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,400
Okay.

2341
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,940
I guess I'm on Phasmophobia duty now.

2342
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:34,240
Alright.

2343
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:35,820
Gone too soon.

2344
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:37,300
Poor Doobie.

2345
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,940
I don't hear them at all.

2346
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,020
So, I assume they're...

2347
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,180
I don't hear screams.

2348
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:44,860
So, I assume they're...

2349
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,220
They're okay?

2350
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:48,740
Oh, where at?

2351
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:49,960
Oh, I'm back here.

2352
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:50,580
Hey, guys.

2353
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:51,720
Where's... Where's Nimi?

2354
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:52,380
Did she die?

2355
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:53,760
Yeah.

2356
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:54,320
Okay.

2357
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:56,000
Alright.

2358
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:57,920
Welcome back.

2359
01:12:59,180 --> 01:12:59,620
Alright.

2360
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,240
I... I... Well, go again.

2361
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:02,460
Yeah, go again.

2362
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:03,740
I somehow stopped it.

2363
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,480
I don't know how.

2364
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:05,960
Wait, you stopped the password?

2365
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,200
Wait, you guys know where the safe is?

2366
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:07,520
No, no, no.

2367
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:08,380
Not the password.

2368
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,180
I... The guy... He stopped chasing after me.

2369
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,160
I don't know why.

2370
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:12,460
Oh.

2371
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:13,500
It was weird.

2372
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,100
Like, I hid here.

2373
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:15,800
Oh.

2374
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:19,000
Maybe it's like the... The distance.

2375
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:19,600
Alright.

2376
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,640
I got you guys.

2377
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:25,220
Okay, we gotta find the safe.

2378
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,280
At chat, are we close to the safe?

2379
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,320
I don't know!

2380
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,520
You need to go through this.

2381
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:33,840
Oh wait, this is a nice spot too.

2382
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,120
Guys, we're... Alright.

2383
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:44,830
Oh my god.

2384
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:46,070
Where is the safe?

2385
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:47,630
Like, I found this.

2386
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:51,150
This is where we died.

2387
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:56,030
And this is where we kept going past.

2388
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:57,990
I'm gonna... We gotta split it up though, I feel like.

2389
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:04,230
Oh, I'm safe.

2390
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:05,310
Okay, they're chasing them.

2391
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:14,710
I don't think they can go past this door.

2392
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:19,590
I haven't seen it, but Min says she has, so...

2393
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:21,710
Oh, I have to not look at them.

2394
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:26,330
Oh my god.

2395
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:28,930
Min says she saw it, so it's like somewhere here.

2396
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:30,630
Unless we're at the wrong house.

2397
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:32,510
Guys, is it here?

2398
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:35,910
Is the safe even here, guys?

2399
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:38,330
Or are we going the wrong way this entire time?

2400
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:42,830
Oh my god.

2401
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:43,350
I swear to god.

2402
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:46,830
We've been like going the wrong way the entire time.

2403
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:50,670
Oh, it is here.

2404
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:52,170
Okay, at least we know it's here.

2405
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:57,790
We're all relying on Min's memory right now.

2406
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,250
Where the safe is.

2407
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:05,550
Because she is the only one out of all of us that has seen it.

2408
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,830
So I hope, I hope it's right.

2409
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:09,490
Oh, I found it.

2410
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:09,810
Guys.

2411
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:10,590
Oh, I found it.

2412
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:11,210
What is it?

2413
01:15:11,330 --> 01:15:11,830
What is it?

2414
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:13,110
What's the number?

2415
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:15,610
I found it.

2416
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:19,350
Guys, I said, I said take a screenshot.

2417
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:22,490
There's no eight.

2418
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:25,270
Okay.

2419
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:27,710
Okay.

2420
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:29,710
I know it started with five.

2421
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:30,290
Five.

2422
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:32,510
Guys, please.

2423
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:33,670
Guys.

2424
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:36,290
What have you had the screenshot?

2425
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:38,330
Please.

2426
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:41,430
I said someone take the screenshot.

2427
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:43,070
Five.

2428
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:47,010
One.

2429
01:15:47,490 --> 01:15:47,730
One.

2430
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:49,330
Two.

2431
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:50,750
Oh my god.

2432
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:51,790
Guys, I have to post it again.

2433
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:53,650
Because some people are posting boob.

2434
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:55,070
Five.

2435
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:55,890
One.

2436
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:56,430
One.

2437
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:57,150
Two.

2438
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:00,370
Guys, please.

2439
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:01,290
Someone had it.

2440
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:03,330
Someone had the entire thing.

2441
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:04,910
One.

2442
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:07,010
Five.

2443
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:10,190
Oh my god.

2444
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:10,790
It's so fast.

2445
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:11,650
One.

2446
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:12,970
Oh my god.

2447
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:13,650
It's too fast.

2448
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:14,130
I can't.

2449
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:15,130
Guys, please.

2450
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:18,610
One.

2451
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:20,810
One.

2452
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:22,730
Two.

2453
01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:23,050
One.

2454
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:23,750
Two.

2455
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:24,150
Oh, I did it.

2456
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:26,030
I got the electrical board.

2457
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:27,970
I don't know how to get out though.

2458
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:31,030
Hello?

2459
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:36,950
Oh my god.

2460
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,110
I'm fucking trapped.

2461
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:51,490
Oh my god.

2462
01:16:51,770 --> 01:16:52,330
Oh my god.

2463
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:52,950
Doobie.

2464
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:55,130
Doobie.

2465
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:57,090
Doobie.

2466
01:16:57,270 --> 01:16:57,590
Doobie.

2467
01:16:57,850 --> 01:16:58,490
Doobie.

2468
01:16:58,490 --> 01:16:59,910
Where are you?

2469
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:02,390
Doobie.

2470
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:17,650
I told you I saw it.

2471
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:18,310
I told you.

2472
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:21,250
All right, it was green.

2473
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:23,030
You should have heard of my song.

2474
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:23,530
Five.

2475
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:25,370
One, one, two.

2476
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:27,550
One, five, one.

2477
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:31,610
Where my chat was just boobs and boobies.

2478
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:37,370
I wanted like one or two people had the right code.

2479
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:39,230
But my chat kept spamming boob.

2480
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:41,250
So I couldn't get it.

2481
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:43,670
So what does this go to?

2482
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:45,250
Um, it's on the outside.

2483
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:46,450
Remember the...

2484
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:47,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2485
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:48,190
All right.

2486
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:50,030
So there's just one more electrical board.

2487
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:51,030
Yeah, we just need one.

2488
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:52,430
How do we get downstairs?

2489
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:56,650
That's a good...

2490
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:58,910
The other one must be in the other save box.

2491
01:17:59,030 --> 01:17:59,870
By the map.

2492
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:01,030
Oh!

2493
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:04,330
Oh, what's the password?

2494
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:05,450
This is where the worm is.

2495
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:07,850
Oh, wait.

2496
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:09,170
You guys, you have to go this way.

2497
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:10,290
No, no, there's another way.

2498
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:10,950
Yeah, why are we going this way?

2499
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:11,550
Yeah, why are we going this way?

2500
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:13,730
Why did we chose the path of the most resistance?

2501
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:14,270
I'm just exploring.

2502
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:14,870
I don't know.

2503
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:20,370
I heard that right behind me.

2504
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:23,270
Who died?

2505
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:24,650
Nobody.

2506
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,150
Well, it wasn't saving.

2507
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:31,410
Somebody.

2508
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:34,770
Wait, I remember we unlocked the door that went downstairs.

2509
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:36,750
Did we?

2510
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:37,630
No, we didn't...

2511
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:38,990
We didn't blow it up, did we?

2512
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:39,550
No, we did.

2513
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:39,870
We did.

2514
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:40,670
We unlocked there.

2515
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:41,150
Yeah, see?

2516
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:43,070
Oh, just kidding.

2517
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:43,830
Yeah, yeah, see?

2518
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,110
She knows the way.

2519
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:48,050
I'm so lost.

2520
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:48,510
It's here.

2521
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:50,170
This is where the thing was.

2522
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:50,430
See?

2523
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:52,350
The moon is literally right below us.

2524
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:56,410
The moon, free the moon, free the moon.

2525
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:57,430
One last...

2526
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:58,810
It's one last task.

2527
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:01,130
We have one last thing to do.

2528
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:04,930
Do you want to try and get the secret way to the basement?

2529
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:07,830
Nah, that's not that important, right?

2530
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:08,470
Okay.

2531
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:09,290
Oh, yeah.

2532
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:10,270
It's helping the guy.

2533
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:11,270
Yeah.

2534
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:11,610
Yeah.

2535
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:14,510
Okay, we need to find the safe.

2536
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:14,930
So true.

2537
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:15,050
True.

2538
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:16,730
Yeah, I know.

2539
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:17,190
All he...

2540
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:19,410
We gave him a TV and then he left, right?

2541
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:20,730
Yeah, yeah.

2542
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:21,430
Yeah.

2543
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:22,570
He was like, see you suckers.

2544
01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:23,550
They knew we're supposed to follow him.

2545
01:19:23,790 --> 01:19:24,610
Like, where did he go?

2546
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:25,490
Did he just float off?

2547
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:26,230
Yeah, he did.

2548
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:29,370
He said there's like a secret way to the basement outside, but whatever.

2549
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:30,570
Yeah, we don't need to know that.

2550
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:31,970
We don't need to know about...

2551
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:35,710
So where do we find the password for the safe box northwest of the ground?

2552
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:37,710
Does anyone know their cardinal directions?

2553
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:40,250
Uh...

2554
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:42,070
Never eat sausage waffles.

2555
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:43,570
Oh, the map!

2556
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:48,310
Never eat sausage waffles.

2557
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:50,830
Maybe the scanner has a, uh...

2558
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:51,570
Oh, that's true.

2559
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:53,110
Yeah, let's go get this.

2560
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:54,150
Look at the blue thing on the map.

2561
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:56,690
Wait, you can pull up the map?

2562
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:57,070
How?

2563
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:58,570
Yeah, there's tab.

2564
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:00,550
Wait, I totally tried that this time.

2565
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:01,230
Oh my god!

2566
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:05,630
Wait, there was a map this entire time?

2567
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:06,290
I've...

2568
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:07,710
Wait, what is the button?

2569
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:09,350
Wait, what is the button?

2570
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:09,670
Wait, what is the button?

2571
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:09,690
Tab?

2572
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:11,010
Tab!

2573
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:11,330
Tab!

2574
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:11,790
Tab!

2575
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:13,830
Why didn't you tell us this?

2576
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:15,650
I just...

2577
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:18,350
I thought I tried it last time and it didn't work.

2578
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:22,770
Why is there a pin on the map?

2579
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:24,430
Yeah, that's what I'm looking at.

2580
01:20:24,430 --> 01:20:25,770
Yeah, maybe that's the next...

2581
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:28,170
That's the next, uh...

2582
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:28,790
Uh...

2583
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:28,970
Yeah.

2584
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:30,010
It's right here.

2585
01:20:30,170 --> 01:20:30,990
We can go check it out.

2586
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:33,490
All right.

2587
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:35,090
Like, it's right here.

2588
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:35,430
No?

2589
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:37,070
Wait, I can't believe we had...

2590
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:37,750
It's inside?

2591
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:38,970
Is it?

2592
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:39,170
Is it?

2593
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:40,270
Is it the way to the basement?

2594
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:40,890
Oh!

2595
01:20:41,530 --> 01:20:41,730
Oh!

2596
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:42,330
It's the way to the basement!

2597
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:42,490
Oh!

2598
01:20:42,610 --> 01:20:43,810
This is what we did there!

2599
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:44,870
We figured it out!

2600
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:46,290
Yeah!

2601
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:49,070
It was just marked on the map.

2602
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:53,130
We have to find the TV in the basement.

2603
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:56,590
Wait, I don't want to be first.

2604
01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:57,030
I'm scared.

2605
01:20:57,470 --> 01:20:58,050
What if the...

2606
01:20:58,050 --> 01:20:59,950
Okay, but it's either first or behind.

2607
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:01,070
Or the last.

2608
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:03,610
Wait, where's the TV head?

2609
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:03,930
Is it safe?

2610
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:08,650
Every time Doobie said it looks safe, the guy shows up, so...

2611
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:10,690
I found...

2612
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:11,110
I found him!

2613
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:12,330
I found him!

2614
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:13,430
There's a guy over here.

2615
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:14,210
There's a guy over here.

2616
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:14,630
Oh!

2617
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:15,070
It's back up ahead.

2618
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:16,090
Better bring a light.

2619
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:16,930
Oh.

2620
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:20,790
Okay, so we have to go forward for the TV head.

2621
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:22,150
It's...

2622
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:22,310
Yeah.

2623
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:23,410
I think it's in here.

2624
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:24,170
Okay.

2625
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:24,750
Oh, there is?

2626
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:24,990
Okay.

2627
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:25,790
Yeah, he's right there.

2628
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:26,570
But he can only get...

2629
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:27,270
Oh, he walked away.

2630
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:27,510
See?

2631
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:28,350
He walked away.

2632
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:30,930
Oh, wait, there's a guy over here, too.

2633
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:32,110
Maybe it's this way.

2634
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:34,570
No.

2635
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:36,210
It's alright.

2636
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:38,770
One of us will die, and then maybe...

2637
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:39,010
Yeah.

2638
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:40,590
Maybe it's...

2639
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:42,830
Oh.

2640
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:45,570
I don't...

2641
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:45,670
What?

2642
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:46,890
Did you hear that?

2643
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:47,410
Someone...

2644
01:21:47,410 --> 01:21:48,010
Stop staring here.

2645
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:48,470
Yeah.

2646
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:49,750
Someone's breathing heavily.

2647
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:50,570
I'll lead him!

2648
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:51,390
I'm bleeding him!

2649
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:54,250
Oh, it's the meow meows!

2650
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:00,370
Hey, she's right behind us.

2651
01:22:00,490 --> 01:22:01,050
Oh, it's here!

2652
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:02,330
It's at the laboratory.

2653
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:06,050
We got the secret, um, the shortcut.

2654
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:10,070
Oh, I don't...

2655
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:11,510
Oh...

2656
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:13,170
I believe in you.

2657
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:20,470
Okay.

2658
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:22,710
There must be a TV here.

2659
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:27,230
Oh my god, it's actually like a labyrinth right here.

2660
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:31,150
Oh, hey, there's a save terminal here.

2661
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:33,290
I found a save here!

2662
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:34,290
Hello!

2663
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:39,450
Wait, I found more stuff here!

2664
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:45,800
Oh my god.

2665
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:47,060
Oh, hey, TV head!

2666
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:49,160
Oh, you're here!

2667
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:50,940
According to note here...

2668
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:54,300
I know it's not if they're not far from here.

2669
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,040
Pretty sure it leads straight there.

2670
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:56,960
Let's go!

2671
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,400
Oh, I found this man.

2672
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:00,500
I talked to him.

2673
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,240
It says talk to...

2674
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,260
Oh, follow TV head!

2675
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:03,940
We gotta follow him!

2676
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:04,420
Wait, where do you go?

2677
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,100
I can't see anything.

2678
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,560
Wait, wait, did you...

2679
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:07,240
Wait, we lost him.

2680
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,540
Oh no, he's in here, here, here, here, here!

2681
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:09,320
Oh, okay.

2682
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:10,400
This way, this way, this way.

2683
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:16,310
I'm following him real close.

2684
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:16,910
I'm following him, yep.

2685
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:18,510
I know, look at him go.

2686
01:23:18,690 --> 01:23:18,950
I know.

2687
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:20,630
Little alien.

2688
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:21,830
Just a little guy.

2689
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:24,110
What did he want him to go to?

2690
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:25,650
Maybe he'll find the password.

2691
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:42,390
I swear to god, if the monster is like, literally right behind us while we're slowly slinking along.

2692
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:43,490
He's right behind me.

2693
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:45,510
He's right behind me, isn't he?

2694
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:46,970
Oh wait, he led us to an elevator.

2695
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:47,410
Oh.

2696
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:48,550
Oh.

2697
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:49,470
Oh.

2698
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:50,150
Is Doobie alive?

2699
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:51,430
I don't think so.

2700
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:55,330
Hey, hey, we're almost at the laboratory.

2701
01:23:56,010 --> 01:23:56,350
Oh, okay.

2702
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:56,990
Oh, eh?

2703
01:23:58,050 --> 01:23:59,750
Oh, that's the secret entrance to the laboratory.

2704
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:02,890
Okay, this is the most convoluted entrance to the laboratory.

2705
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:04,490
Are

2706
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,760
you gonna perform surgery on this man?

2707
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,660
We're gonna perform surgery on this man.

2708
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,200
Wait, this is...

2709
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,960
This room does not feel safe.

2710
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:17,900
Oh.

2711
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:18,400
What was that?

2712
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,300
Is he gonna kill us?

2713
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:21,620
Is he the final boss?

2714
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,600
I don't, I don't trust him.

2715
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,260
Look at him.

2716
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:28,360
He's just smiling at us.

2717
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:29,820
Just a little guy.

2718
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:30,820
Is there Covid in here?

2719
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:31,820
No?

2720
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,860
There's a safe station!

2721
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,880
Oh, nice, nice.

2722
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,440
But do we just follow him first?

2723
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:37,720
I think so.

2724
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:38,840
Yeah, just follow him for now.

2725
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:40,120
But there's a giant ass button.

2726
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:44,820
Oh.

2727
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:45,680
Okay, let's say...

2728
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:46,540
Let's get Doobie here.

2729
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:46,740
Oh.

2730
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:47,720
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2731
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:48,340
Oh, sorry.

2732
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,100
Sorry, sorry.

2733
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,800
Oh, he wants the orange down there.

2734
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:55,180
Oh, no, there's a...

2735
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:55,800
Covid head!

2736
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:56,640
Don't do it!

2737
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:56,980
Don't do it!

2738
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:57,760
Okay, wait, wait, let's...

2739
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,020
Let's get Doobie here first.

2740
01:24:59,280 --> 01:24:59,640
Guys.

2741
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:01,660
All right.

2742
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:03,500
Yeah!

2743
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:04,820
All right, who's good at...

2744
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:06,060
Who's good at crane games?

2745
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:12,000
Where is this?

2746
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:16,500
Wait, where is the grabber?

2747
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,700
Oh, it's a game pad.

2748
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:18,320
Yeah.

2749
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:19,680
Oh, I see it!

2750
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:20,180
Over there!

2751
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:21,320
Over there, you gotta move it.

2752
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:21,340
Oh, okay.

2753
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:21,980
Who's good at...

2754
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:23,000
Who's good at this?

2755
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:24,220
Not me.

2756
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:25,480
I didn't even see what's moving.

2757
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:26,880
I fluff it every time.

2758
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:27,360
Okay.

2759
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:27,980
Keep going left.

2760
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:28,880
Oh, all right.

2761
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:29,780
Keep going left.

2762
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:30,760
Left.

2763
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:32,300
You're good.

2764
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:33,080
You're good.

2765
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:34,200
You're good.

2766
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:35,280
All right.

2767
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:35,760
You're good.

2768
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:36,420
You're good.

2769
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:37,520
Tell me you wanna stop.

2770
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,000
You're good.

2771
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:40,240
You're good.

2772
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:40,700
Stop.

2773
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,040
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

2774
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:43,120
Oh.

2775
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:45,740
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2776
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:47,080
Just a little bit over to the left more.

2777
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:48,140
You have to go back more.

2778
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:48,880
Back?

2779
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:49,480
Okay.

2780
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:51,880
Yeah.

2781
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:53,900
Stop.

2782
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,020
It didn't stop.

2783
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:56,580
Wait a little to the left.

2784
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:58,580
Oh, I have to press it again.

2785
01:25:58,760 --> 01:25:58,960
Okay.

2786
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:00,020
Tell me when to stop.

2787
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:00,800
Stop.

2788
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,200
To the left a little.

2789
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:04,720
A little bit more, I think.

2790
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,260
Try now.

2791
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:06,800
All right.

2792
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:09,800
Oh.

2793
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:10,920
Go for the back.

2794
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,100
Come on.

2795
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:14,040
A little more to the left.

2796
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:16,500
And then...

2797
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:16,860
A little back.

2798
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:17,720
Back?

2799
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:18,900
Yeah.

2800
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:19,540
Yeah, a little back.

2801
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:19,720
Yeah, a little back.

2802
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,320
Okay.

2803
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,120
And a little more to the left.

2804
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:25,280
Right?

2805
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:25,820
Right?

2806
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:27,000
Left?

2807
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:27,660
Left?

2808
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:27,980
Left?

2809
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:29,740
Guys, left.

2810
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:33,000
Guys, left.

2811
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,140
Oh my god.

2812
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,300
Is it even open?

2813
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:38,440
Open?

2814
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:39,500
Okay, guys.

2815
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:40,860
First off, is it open?

2816
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,160
I don't know.

2817
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,320
I don't know.

2818
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:45,580
Okay.

2819
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:46,140
Oh, left.

2820
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:47,140
Left.

2821
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:48,020
Okay.

2822
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:50,600
Okay.

2823
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:51,140
Left.

2824
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,280
Oh my god.

2825
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:53,820
Okay, okay.

2826
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:54,000
More left.

2827
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:54,580
More left, more back.

2828
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:55,700
More left, more back.

2829
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:56,140
Okay.

2830
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,460
Is this good?

2831
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:06,080
Oh my god, how precise is this?

2832
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:12,920
Are you serious?

2833
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,780
Guys, I swear to god, if this was not open and... Wait, what?

2834
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:22,940
Are we not?

2835
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:27,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2836
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:29,120
Oh wait, left, left.

2837
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:32,460
Stop.

2838
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:34,800
Stop, you have to press it again.

2839
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:37,280
You have to press it again.

2840
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:38,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2841
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:39,580
Did I get it?

2842
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:40,940
Oh, wait!

2843
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:42,340
Do me!

2844
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:43,520
It was our perspective.

2845
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:45,240
Oh my god.

2846
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:46,300
I couldn't see it.

2847
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,520
Oh, and then we have to pull it back to him.

2848
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:50,700
Yeah.

2849
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:51,280
Oh.

2850
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:51,940
Yeah.

2851
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:54,240
Oh yeah, put it on and put it on.

2852
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:55,220
Wait, he's gonna die.

2853
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:57,020
I need to use the bathroom.

2854
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:57,800
Someone else do it.

2855
01:27:57,880 --> 01:27:58,420
I'll be right back.

2856
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:00,220
Okay.

2857
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:04,140
Wait, you're gonna die, Doki.

2858
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:04,760
You're right here.

2859
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,300
Wait, it's gonna touch you.

2860
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:08,720
Doki, why did you stop right there?

2861
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:10,720
Just let her die.

2862
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:11,480
Yeah.

2863
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:12,760
What is it?

2864
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:15,440
That's as far as it goes.

2865
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,160
Yeah, it's as far as it goes.

2866
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,780
Maybe talk to him and then he's like, oh.

2867
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,040
Wait, I can grab it.

2868
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:20,900
Okay.

2869
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:20,900
Oh.

2870
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:22,320
Okay.

2871
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,460
I don't think this is gonna be good.

2872
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:25,640
Talk to him.

2873
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:28,920
This is a good orange.

2874
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:30,460
This is what we need.

2875
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,700
We'll be able to install it in the operating room.

2876
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:35,060
We are performing surgery.

2877
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,340
Doki will follow us.

2878
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:43,240
I'll come back.

2879
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,080
I'll come back.

2880
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:45,040
Yeah, we'll pick her up.

2881
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:45,700
We'll pick her up.

2882
01:28:50,590 --> 01:28:51,250
What is it?

2883
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:51,890
What is it?

2884
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:38,940
I have a crane operator.

2885
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:41,480
I have a crane operator.

2886
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:45,680
I'm back.

2887
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:46,740
Did we do it?

2888
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:47,180
Hello.

2889
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:47,640
Yeah.

2890
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:47,880
What happened?

2891
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:50,320
Oh, we're...

2892
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,200
To the operating room.

2893
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:51,680
This way.

2894
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:51,820
Oh, okay.

2895
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:54,000
I believe.

2896
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:54,880
Oh, hey.

2897
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:55,580
Wait.

2898
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:57,720
You guys are just carrying the head, just like that.

2899
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,120
It's time to replace the head.

2900
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:01,320
I'm about to perform so...

2901
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:02,900
We're gonna do a surgery on the alien!

2902
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,240
It's like the Mei Mei say.

2903
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:08,440
Okay, here I go.

2904
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,400
First, you need to remove the TV.

2905
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,320
Then you put the orange in its place.

2906
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:15,520
Why does he want this?

2907
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:21,020
I'm ready to be a TV head with no TV.

2908
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,280
Let's hope it all goes right.

2909
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:28,020
It's gonna be built differently, so I'm gonna be like the other one.

2910
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,080
Oh my god, he's T-posing!

2911
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,520
He's... he's T-posing!

2912
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,780
I'm taking... wait, I can't... can someone else take the head?

2913
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:36,220
Yeah.

2914
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,320
Yeah, take... yeah, there you go.

2915
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,040
I took it.

2916
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:40,580
I'm applying the item.

2917
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,420
Oh my god, that's how he be...

2918
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:50,240
Wait, I think he'll be... isn't he evil now?

2919
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:51,640
Yes.

2920
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:52,560
Maybe?

2921
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:54,100
No, he seems cool.

2922
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,300
Yeah, he's cool now.

2923
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:56,640
Oh, another orange head.

2924
01:30:57,140 --> 01:30:58,940
Oh, he's... he won't talk to me.

2925
01:30:59,440 --> 01:30:59,540
Oh?

2926
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:00,660
Dot, dot, dot.

2927
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:01,840
Dot, dot, dot, dot.

2928
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:02,160
Dot, dot?

2929
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:03,740
Maybe we need to bring him something?

2930
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:04,820
Oh, he's talking to me.

2931
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:05,320
What the hell?

2932
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:06,320
Oh, he didn't like you.

2933
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:06,700
Oh.

2934
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,020
I think I got an orange for a head now.

2935
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:09,400
Yay!

2936
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,780
Some feel... some reason I feel drawn upward.

2937
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:15,200
That's unusual.

2938
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:16,820
Yeah, that's weird.

2939
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:18,560
Maybe somebody else has to talk to him now.

2940
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:19,300
Oh, okay.

2941
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:20,520
You're turning me.

2942
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:21,900
Okay.

2943
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:23,940
I think I might be able to try something.

2944
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:26,120
I'll be in the courtyard of the main building.

2945
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:27,540
Where's the courtyard?

2946
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:28,960
Wait, guys, remember this...

2947
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,300
The other dead... dead alien?

2948
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:32,180
Yeah.

2949
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:32,780
Oh, yeah.

2950
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:33,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2951
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:34,960
Oh!

2952
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:35,260
Oh!

2953
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:37,600
Maybe he'll tell us the codes.

2954
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:41,420
Okay, we just got...

2955
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:42,400
I don't think we can open that.

2956
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,340
We gotta find the...

2957
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:45,560
So, we gotta go to the courtyard.

2958
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:49,680
And then, also, we gotta give the other dead alien this other TV.

2959
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:50,800
Yeah.

2960
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,200
That was so far away.

2961
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:53,980
Okay, yeah, there must be a...

2962
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:54,540
How did we get down here?

2963
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:55,840
The guide led us here.

2964
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:56,840
How did we get down here?

2965
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:57,100
How did we get down here?

2966
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:58,400
Wait, you're right.

2967
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:59,820
We don't have a flashlight.

2968
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:03,040
I don't remember.

2969
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:05,560
Oh, is there an elevator to the main area?

2970
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:06,240
I don't know.

2971
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:07,420
Wait, maybe...

2972
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:07,560
Maybe?

2973
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:09,100
Okay, we save.

2974
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:09,560
We save.

2975
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,900
We never went this way.

2976
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,200
Maybe this way tells us.

2977
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:14,980
Oh, yeah.

2978
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:15,940
Here we can buy...

2979
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:16,140
No.

2980
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:18,620
I got a flashlight.

2981
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:19,580
Wait, there's a...

2982
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:20,920
There's a basement, guys.

2983
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:21,480
Right there.

2984
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:21,780
The flashlight.

2985
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:22,580
There's a basement.

2986
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:22,880
Oh, my gosh.

2987
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:25,480
Oh, this goes down to the first floor.

2988
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:26,460
Maybe we die if we want.

2989
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:26,760
Yeah, yeah.

2990
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:30,160
And then, from there, we can take the elevator to go to the first floor.

2991
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,140
Wait, was there nothing here?

2992
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:33,600
Oh.

2993
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:35,300
Can I take this?

2994
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:36,880
There's nothing here.

2995
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:37,740
Oh, there's...

2996
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:38,080
Yeah.

2997
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:41,080
How mysterious.

2998
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:43,400
Oh, it is...

2999
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,820
Oh, yay shortcut.

3000
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,600
Oh, this is so handy.

3001
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:48,340
Yeah.

3002
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:49,840
There's a little goo, guys.

3003
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:50,580
So let's go.

3004
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:52,020
Yeah, we don't look at them.

3005
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:53,720
She can't get in the elevator, right?

3006
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:54,640
No.

3007
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:56,380
No, no.

3008
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:57,460
No one can get in the elevator.

3009
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:01,120
No, none of the aliens can get in.

3010
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,300
They're not loud.

3011
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:04,440
Was it the...

3012
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:05,480
Third floor.

3013
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:06,000
Third floor?

3014
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:06,760
Third floor.

3015
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:09,000
Yeah, we're in the first floor right now.

3016
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:10,200
Okay.

3017
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:13,800
We're doing it, guys.

3018
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:14,760
We just need...

3019
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:15,020
It's a panel.

3020
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:16,500
I wanna watch Cartoon Network.

3021
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:18,720
No, I'm a...

3022
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,240
I'm a Nickelodeon kid.

3023
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:22,180
Dexter's lab is on.

3024
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:22,800
Come on.

3025
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:23,720
First floor.

3026
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:25,440
Wait, what are we doing here?

3027
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:26,260
Oh, the other elevator.

3028
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:27,040
Yeah.

3029
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:28,800
Alright.

3030
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:32,440
We're almost there.

3031
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:34,720
What are we doing?

3032
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:35,740
Uh...

3033
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:36,760
Wait, which one do we do first?

3034
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:38,080
The TV or the courtyard?

3035
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:40,840
Um...

3036
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:41,460
Closer.

3037
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:42,520
Yeah.

3038
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:43,560
I think...

3039
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,480
I think the TV's closer, right?

3040
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:48,480
Well, I mean, we have to go to the courtyard first, to be fair, but...

3041
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:49,700
Yeah.

3042
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:50,780
Maybe the TV?

3043
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:51,960
Just in case.

3044
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,880
The TV would be a little more dangerous.

3045
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:57,420
Is it the first floor or the basement?

3046
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:00,700
Uh...

3047
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,040
Basement?

3048
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:05,100
Uh...

3049
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:07,060
I don't...

3050
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:07,540
Remember.

3051
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:08,560
It'll come back to us.

3052
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,340
Wait, we have a map.

3053
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,560
Why are we asking each other this?

3054
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:12,800
There's no map data.

3055
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:14,800
Oh...

3056
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:15,940
I think it's only for outside.

3057
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,360
Oh, wait, someone said first floor.

3058
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:18,900
Let's go do that.

3059
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:20,220
Dude, there's just one guy.

3060
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:21,600
Um, excuse...

3061
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:22,440
It's two guys.

3062
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,380
Uh, one is a member and one isn't.

3063
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:26,100
It's so loud.

3064
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:27,240
Oh, okay.

3065
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:27,780
Oh, okay.

3066
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:29,020
Oh, it's here!

3067
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,700
And then we go to the second floor.

3068
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:35,060
Wait.

3069
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:35,620
No, see?

3070
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:36,400
Oh, he's here.

3071
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:37,820
Where's the courtyard?

3072
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:38,440
There he is.

3073
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:38,960
There he is.

3074
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:39,960
Yeah, there he is.

3075
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,440
He's waiting for us.

3076
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:41,780
Yeah.

3077
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:43,560
Is he just gonna float away?

3078
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,720
He walked out of the stairwell?

3079
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:49,280
I know what happens to him.

3080
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:49,720
Yeah.

3081
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,480
He's sitting outside.

3082
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:52,520
It's so cute.

3083
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:53,020
Aw.

3084
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:54,780
I just...

3085
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:55,140
Hey!

3086
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:57,640
I think I'll be better there.

3087
01:34:57,940 --> 01:34:59,400
Feels like I could jump.

3088
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:00,180
Really?

3089
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:01,440
What's stopping me?

3090
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:02,020
Don't jump!

3091
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:04,300
Just the thought of how long I'll keep falling.

3092
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:05,320
That scares me a bit.

3093
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:06,360
Aw.

3094
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:07,320
Aw.

3095
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:08,740
I'll talk to him, I guess?

3096
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:09,460
I'll tell him.

3097
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:10,060
Yeah?

3098
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:11,200
Oh, thank you.

3099
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:13,060
I couldn't have done any of this without you.

3100
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:14,780
It's time for me to go.

3101
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:15,600
No!

3102
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:15,900
No!

3103
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:16,460
No!

3104
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:16,740
No!

3105
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:16,800
No!

3106
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:19,920
His people need him!

3107
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:20,460
Wait!

3108
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:29,060
There he goes!

3109
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:30,180
Oh!

3110
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:34,900
Did we do the right thing?

3111
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:36,880
Oh, seven in the chat!

3112
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:40,120
Wait!

3113
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:42,780
It says visit the operating room in the laboratory again.

3114
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:43,820
Okay, do we do the...

3115
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:45,940
I guess we should go to the operating room, right?

3116
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:48,120
That's where we just were.

3117
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:49,140
Yeah, but...

3118
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:49,660
I think so.

3119
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:50,940
But that's his next...

3120
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:53,140
I think we should do the TV guide first, so I see...

3121
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:55,000
I think this progresses the story.

3122
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:57,460
And I think the other one was like a bonus side quest.

3123
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:58,040
Oh...

3124
01:35:58,040 --> 01:35:58,880
Yeah, I think so too.

3125
01:35:58,960 --> 01:35:59,260
Yeah, that's fair.

3126
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:01,860
Yeah, so we should do the side quest for just to see.

3127
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:04,160
Cause I think it's a reward for completing it.

3128
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:05,740
Okay!

3129
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:06,520
Yeah, yeah.

3130
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:07,100
Yeah, me too!

3131
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:07,620
Me too!

3132
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:08,460
Cool one!

3133
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,900
It was like that song, what was that?

3134
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:14,920
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

3135
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:16,020
What is this?

3136
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:16,680
Is this the...

3137
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:16,920
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3138
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:19,940
And then...

3139
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:21,500
Wait, where's the elevator?

3140
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:22,160
Because it's here.

3141
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:22,440
Oh, here, here.

3142
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:23,820
Okay.

3143
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:25,460
Yeah, and then...

3144
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:26,840
Laboratory.

3145
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:30,060
Yeah, we're doing it guys.

3146
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:32,260
Got it.

3147
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:36,000
His final message was for us to go to the operating room.

3148
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:37,120
Yeah.

3149
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:38,500
Yeah.

3150
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:39,580
Maybe there's like a tracker on him.

3151
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:40,280
Yeah, maybe.

3152
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:45,760
Do you think he... Do you think... Like, do you think he's still floating in space right now?

3153
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:47,240
Yeah.

3154
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:48,920
He's probably not there yet.

3155
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:50,140
He's going to the moon.

3156
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:52,060
Another moon.

3157
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:53,380
Another moon.

3158
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:55,220
Wait, why are we following Mint?

3159
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,520
Does she know where to go?

3160
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:57,140
It's the elevator.

3161
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:57,500
Oh.

3162
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:00,280
That was stupid.

3163
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:03,620
I was gonna say, does she actually know... I don't remember what floor it was.

3164
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:04,320
It was first floor.

3165
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:05,140
Oh, it was on the first floor?

3166
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:05,500
Yeah.

3167
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:05,840
Yeah.

3168
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:06,900
Mm-hmm.

3169
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:09,780
On the first floor?

3170
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:11,300
Yeah.

3171
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:12,080
Oh, my God.

3172
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:13,740
Am I holding the TV while doing this?

3173
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:15,700
Yeah, you are.

3174
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:16,240
Whoa.

3175
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:16,960
Whoa.

3176
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,280
And then I'm right here to the... Where are you?

3177
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:21,980
Pretty gnarly, guys.

3178
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:23,920
Gnarly.

3179
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:26,680
Is this opening stairway?

3180
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:27,560
Do you see it?

3181
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:28,400
Yeah.

3182
01:37:28,820 --> 01:37:29,420
I don't know.

3183
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:31,360
This way?

3184
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:32,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3185
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:32,800
I remember.

3186
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,080
And then there's the operating table.

3187
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:36,240
Yeah, yeah.

3188
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:36,480
Yeah, yeah.

3189
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:36,740
I don't know.

3190
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:41,100
But what do we have to do here again, I wonder?

3191
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,940
Uh... I think he just... He gave us something.

3192
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:44,540
Yeah, yeah, see?

3193
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:46,340
Final message.

3194
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:46,580
Final message.

3195
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:48,260
Oh!

3196
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:51,720
What's it say?

3197
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:52,940
Place the... Oh!

3198
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:55,100
Place the crystal inside to upgrade it.

3199
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:57,760
The upgrade crystal is capable of destroying the oranges.

3200
01:37:58,300 --> 01:37:58,600
Oh!

3201
01:37:59,220 --> 01:37:59,620
Oh!

3202
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:00,420
That would be huge!

3203
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:02,040
Wait, where's... That would be huge!

3204
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:04,120
That would be huge!

3205
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:05,100
Yeah, booby.

3206
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:07,280
I'll just wait here.

3207
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:07,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3208
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:08,480
All the way over here.

3209
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:08,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3210
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:08,680
All the way over here.

3211
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:10,360
Like, only one of you guys have to do that.

3212
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:12,720
I'll wait here, guys.

3213
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:15,320
Because my chat also died, so I gotta fix that.

3214
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,820
It died on my end.

3215
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:22,000
Yeah, I knew this was, like, a bonus mission thing.

3216
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:26,120
Because that's a... Because it's... Like, we got an achievement for it, so it was a side...

3217
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:26,600
Okay, guys.

3218
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:28,480
How do we do the...

3219
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,560
Find the... Guys, please.

3220
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:33,620
We just need to find the password for the safe box, guys.

3221
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:35,620
We're killing all his friends, though.

3222
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:35,920
Oh!

3223
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:36,900
Oh!

3224
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:38,020
What if he dies up there?

3225
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:38,800
Yeah, come on!

3226
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,480
It's okay, he's in space.

3227
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,100
Wait, so where do I put it?

3228
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:43,260
In the box, right?

3229
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:45,580
Place the crystal inside to upgrade it.

3230
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:46,440
Yeah, yeah.

3231
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:46,920
This box.

3232
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:48,000
Oh.

3233
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:49,260
Oh.

3234
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:51,460
I don't think that's the right...

3235
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:52,100
I don't think that's the right...

3236
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,000
Oh!

3237
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:54,740
Oh!

3238
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:55,660
Oh!

3239
01:38:58,760 --> 01:38:59,520
Oh, it upgraded.

3240
01:38:59,520 --> 01:38:59,780
It's upgraded.

3241
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:01,740
It's upgraded.

3242
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:02,980
Cool!

3243
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:03,800
Yay!

3244
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:05,200
Yeah, I have the TV.

3245
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,500
Also, we got, like, a special little thing to...

3246
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:08,340
I'd take it!

3247
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:08,920
Yeah!

3248
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,000
Alright.

3249
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:11,820
Let's go find the TV.

3250
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:15,180
Are they dead, then?

3251
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:15,680
Let's see.

3252
01:39:15,940 --> 01:39:16,740
They were down here.

3253
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:17,280
Oh.

3254
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:20,860
Well, we have to take... We have to, like, go up towards them, right?

3255
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:21,560
To kill it?

3256
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:21,820
Yeah.

3257
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:22,980
Yeah, yeah.

3258
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:23,920
It's, like, AOE.

3259
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:25,720
Oh, wait, let's save.

3260
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:26,340
Let's save.

3261
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:26,780
Let's save, yeah.

3262
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:27,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3263
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:30,160
I'm coming, I'm coming!

3264
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:31,900
Yay!

3265
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:32,440
Okay.

3266
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:35,560
Okay, now we can go through the last password easily.

3267
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:37,260
Um...

3268
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:39,800
Yeah, we'll be able to walk through that, like, whole area.

3269
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:40,200
Yeah.

3270
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:42,200
But where is the password, though?

3271
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:44,280
I don't know.

3272
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:45,380
Oh, yeah.

3273
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:46,520
Please do...

3274
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:47,960
Wait, no, we have a map now.

3275
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:48,420
We have a map.

3276
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:49,080
Oh, yeah, that's true.

3277
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:50,680
That's true, that's true.

3278
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:51,320
That's true, that's true.

3279
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:51,980
Any truers?

3280
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:54,660
Okay.

3281
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:56,700
We got this.

3282
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:57,220
Okay.

3283
01:39:57,220 --> 01:39:58,180
Everything's coming together.

3284
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:00,840
I believe.

3285
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:01,520
Super Cheeto.

3286
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:03,760
Super Cheeto.

3287
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:04,900
Alright.

3288
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:08,560
I got my TV.

3289
01:40:08,980 --> 01:40:10,140
We got our Cheeto.

3290
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:10,860
Um...

3291
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:11,760
We're ready to game.

3292
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:12,940
Good night, right?

3293
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:13,160
Yeah.

3294
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:14,040
Yeah.

3295
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:17,980
I'm ready for our LAN party, guys.

3296
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:24,440
We're still upgrading permanent.

3297
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:25,500
We have to do it every time.

3298
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,960
Oh, we're not gonna lose it, so we don't have...

3299
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:28,060
Yeah.

3300
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:28,700
Yeah.

3301
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:29,440
Exactly.

3302
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:31,780
Oh, yeah, it's first floor.

3303
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:38,360
Okay.

3304
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,960
The TV head guy is on the second floor.

3305
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:41,760
So we got...

3306
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:41,920
Whoa!

3307
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:45,580
Go, guys.

3308
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:46,260
Woo!

3309
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:49,000
Okay.

3310
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,620
Does anyone know how to get to the second floor?

3311
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:54,520
Um, we got...

3312
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,400
Maybe we could go from the court...

3313
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:57,380
From the annex, right?

3314
01:40:59,500 --> 01:40:59,900
Uh...

3315
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:00,800
Oh, here, here, here.

3316
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:00,940
Yeah.

3317
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:02,060
Found it.

3318
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:04,380
Okay.

3319
01:41:05,180 --> 01:41:06,120
Uh, TV head.

3320
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:08,380
Oh, we're gonna go kill them?

3321
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:09,320
No, no, no.

3322
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,480
We're gonna give him the last alien the TV.

3323
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:13,000
Yeah, let's give the last...

3324
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:13,140
Yeah.

3325
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:14,620
The other alien the TV first, I think.

3326
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:15,000
Okay.

3327
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:16,580
Yeah, but where is he?

3328
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:18,880
I don't remember where he was.

3329
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:20,620
I remember the first guy was here, but...

3330
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:22,300
Yeah, he's all the way up down here.

3331
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:22,920
He's all the way down here.

3332
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:23,320
He's right here.

3333
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:23,800
He's right here.

3334
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:24,900
Oh, okay.

3335
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:26,080
Hello, TV man.

3336
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:27,820
Take the TV.

3337
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:28,820
Hello.

3338
01:41:29,540 --> 01:41:30,880
Do you want an orb too?

3339
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:31,440
Hi.

3340
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:33,940
Oh, he's happier.

3341
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:34,680
Yeah.

3342
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:35,840
Oh.

3343
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:36,480
Hello.

3344
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:37,480
Uh, hello?

3345
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,440
You kind of remind me of something.

3346
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:45,380
Did you even know creatures like you pissed off the little black liquid creatures?

3347
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:46,480
What?

3348
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:49,360
They got all bothered and now, well, this is happening.

3349
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:50,620
Yeah, what, me?

3350
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:52,680
Yeah, I meant you.

3351
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:56,040
And, uh, you sort of plugged the TV into me.

3352
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:57,740
We didn't ask for his consent.

3353
01:41:57,860 --> 01:42:00,060
Now I can't even look away from all this weirdness.

3354
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:01,140
He's not grateful at all.

3355
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:04,280
He didn't help me.

3356
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:05,060
Where did he go?

3357
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:05,560
Oh.

3358
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:07,700
Look what you did.

3359
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:09,760
You didn't ask for his consent.

3360
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:11,580
To have a TV on his head.

3361
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,440
You are the one holding the TV.

3362
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:14,180
No.

3363
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:15,940
I don't know what you're talking about.

3364
01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:17,720
Wait, we should go save over here real quick.

3365
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:18,040
Oh, yeah.

3366
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:18,540
That's true.

3367
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:21,420
Oh, I hear him.

3368
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:22,320
I hear him.

3369
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:22,840
I hear him.

3370
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:24,060
Wait, what kind of guy?

3371
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:26,240
Like the Slenderman.

3372
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:26,820
Yeah?

3373
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:27,360
Yeah.

3374
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:30,640
The one that always gets us.

3375
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:31,620
Okay, now.

3376
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:32,260
Look at the map.

3377
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:33,600
Yeah.

3378
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:36,180
Maybe we go to the courtyard would tell us.

3379
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:37,360
Okay.

3380
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:39,540
We mean the courtyard.

3381
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,300
I mean the courtyard tell us.

3382
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,020
Oh, the grounds.

3383
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:43,060
Because it says the grounds.

3384
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:44,360
So I assume it's outside.

3385
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:46,560
Oh, northwest of the grounds.

3386
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:48,400
Oh, there's like other guys over there.

3387
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:49,160
Wait, how do we get...

3388
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:49,760
I know that the...

3389
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:52,240
There's the safety box is where the map was.

3390
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:54,700
But I don't know where the password is.

3391
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:56,560
Yeah, cause we need to...

3392
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,100
Find the password for it.

3393
01:42:58,200 --> 01:42:59,900
It says northwest of the grounds.

3394
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:01,120
So...

3395
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,300
Maybe the...

3396
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:02,980
Okay, guys.

3397
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:04,700
We know our cardinal directions now, right?

3398
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:05,700
Yeah.

3399
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:08,220
Okay, so there's a staircase here.

3400
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:13,800
Alright, let's go downstairs.

3401
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:17,040
Just like here.

3402
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:19,160
And then...

3403
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:19,300
Alright.

3404
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:21,160
We have a map now.

3405
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:23,360
Where's northwest?

3406
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:24,600
Oh, yeah.

3407
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,240
I'm on somebody's...

3408
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,560
Oh, that's where that building is.

3409
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:27,540
Where that, uh...

3410
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:28,180
Face guy.

3411
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:30,400
Yeah, yeah.

3412
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:32,160
Where the face guy is bothering us.

3413
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:32,700
Alright.

3414
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:33,900
And we know what to do.

3415
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:35,440
We just gotta go northwest.

3416
01:43:36,180 --> 01:43:36,960
Oh, he's like right there.

3417
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:37,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3418
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:39,680
He goes through the gate, so be careful.

3419
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:40,860
Oh, he does?

3420
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,080
We'll wait for him to go back the other way.

3421
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:43,560
There he goes.

3422
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,500
There he goes.

3423
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:46,460
Look at him go.

3424
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:47,520
Wait, what are we...

3425
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:48,820
We're looking for a password.

3426
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:51,260
Yeah, it says northwest of the grounds.

3427
01:43:57,130 --> 01:43:58,270
Which one's northwest?

3428
01:43:59,130 --> 01:43:59,950
Is that north...

3429
01:43:59,950 --> 01:44:01,430
Could you just say, what is northwest?

3430
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:03,270
I mean, where...

3431
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:04,650
Where is northwest?

3432
01:44:05,230 --> 01:44:05,930
Uh-oh.

3433
01:44:06,050 --> 01:44:06,970
He's coming, he's coming.

3434
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:07,870
Oh my god.

3435
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:08,910
Guys, we gotta split up.

3436
01:44:10,350 --> 01:44:11,390
I think he's on me.

3437
01:44:11,650 --> 01:44:12,550
What have I done?

3438
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:16,660
I didn't even hear her final words.

3439
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:17,380
Did she die?

3440
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:21,040
Let's stop left.

3441
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:21,440
Okay.

3442
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:24,100
So it's somewhere here.

3443
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:27,400
It's somewhere here.

3444
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:32,500
Let's split up, gang.

3445
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:34,700
Are you alive?

3446
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:38,560
I opened the door to the van.

3447
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:39,400
Oh.

3448
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:40,980
Yeah, this is the password.

3449
01:44:41,980 --> 01:44:44,040
We still need a fire...

3450
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:44,700
Like, I mean...

3451
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:45,440
This is the...

3452
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:45,960
The safe.

3453
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:46,620
Wait, hold on.

3454
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:48,860
Wait, I'll wait for him to pass again.

3455
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:52,100
Wait, is Mint alive?

3456
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,080
Yeah, she's over there.

3457
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:55,080
Oh, okay.

3458
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:57,240
Mint, you can die now!

3459
01:45:02,180 --> 01:45:04,360
Wait, we should put our upgraded...

3460
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:06,060
Crystal here, just in case.

3461
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:06,860
I'll drop it.

3462
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:07,800
I don't wanna die.

3463
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:08,440
I don't wanna die.

3464
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:09,400
Okay, I'm gonna go to the van.

3465
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:09,980
Okay.

3466
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:11,360
Is that the password?

3467
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:12,560
No.

3468
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:13,580
Hold on, I'll tell ya.

3469
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:17,400
I didn't get the password.

3470
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:19,020
Wait, you got a special what?

3471
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:20,720
Special book.

3472
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:22,300
Freaking lame.

3473
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:23,020
Aww.

3474
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:23,860
Aww.

3475
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,840
Okay, we gotta still find the...

3476
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:31,700
The password.

3477
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:32,980
Oh!

3478
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:33,860
Oh my god!

3479
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:35,080
I know what the password is!

3480
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:35,820
It's really dumb!

3481
01:45:37,740 --> 01:45:39,220
Oh my god, I'll show you later.

3482
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:39,560
Okay.

3483
01:45:39,820 --> 01:45:40,040
Wait.

3484
01:45:40,740 --> 01:45:41,060
Okay.

3485
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:42,720
One of the numbers is three.

3486
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:44,900
How do you know?

3487
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:46,080
Okay.

3488
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:46,440
Oh my god.

3489
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:46,740
Okay.

3490
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:47,580
Okay.

3491
01:45:47,860 --> 01:45:48,740
Come over here, guys.

3492
01:45:48,940 --> 01:45:50,220
I'll show you what I know.

3493
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:52,420
What do you know?

3494
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:55,640
What do you know?

3495
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:57,320
Look down.

3496
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:00,240
Look down.

3497
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:02,660
Oh my god!

3498
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:04,920
One of it is three!

3499
01:46:09,170 --> 01:46:10,450
One of it is three!

3500
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:11,650
What is the other number?

3501
01:46:11,650 --> 01:46:11,790
What?

3502
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:14,950
What?

3503
01:46:14,950 --> 01:46:16,130
How do we know the order?

3504
01:46:18,210 --> 01:46:20,570
Oh, I'm so alive, everyone.

3505
01:46:21,230 --> 01:46:22,470
I'm so alive.

3506
01:46:22,470 --> 01:46:22,710
I'm still alive.

3507
01:46:24,650 --> 01:46:25,090
What is the password?

3508
01:46:25,090 --> 01:46:25,750
You guys done the password?

3509
01:46:26,190 --> 01:46:27,790
One of the numbers is three.

3510
01:46:28,650 --> 01:46:29,750
One of them was three.

3511
01:46:29,950 --> 01:46:30,990
I don't know what...

3512
01:46:32,150 --> 01:46:32,950
How did you do...

3513
01:46:32,950 --> 01:46:34,850
I didn't see how you saw what the number was.

3514
01:46:34,850 --> 01:46:39,090
If you go up to that tree and then you look down and there's a number three on it.

3515
01:46:40,810 --> 01:46:42,710
Do you think it's the five trees?

3516
01:46:43,070 --> 01:46:43,370
No.

3517
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:46,890
Oh, there are five.

3518
01:46:48,790 --> 01:46:50,610
Oh my god.

3519
01:46:51,410 --> 01:46:52,870
Okay, so the three...

3520
01:46:52,870 --> 01:46:55,010
The third is...

3521
01:46:55,010 --> 01:46:55,590
Okay, wait.

3522
01:46:55,790 --> 01:46:57,150
This is one...

3523
01:46:57,150 --> 01:46:59,050
Okay, number two is three.

3524
01:46:59,350 --> 01:46:59,470
Okay.

3525
01:46:59,850 --> 01:47:01,070
Yeah, number two is three.

3526
01:47:01,410 --> 01:47:01,550
Okay.

3527
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:04,130
Oh my god, this is hellish.

3528
01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:04,810
Okay.

3529
01:47:06,270 --> 01:47:07,850
All right, guys, we got it.

3530
01:47:08,090 --> 01:47:09,350
Okay, I'm gonna go look for number one.

3531
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:11,210
Okay, I'll look... let's split up, gang.

3532
01:47:11,970 --> 01:47:14,310
I'll look for number...

3533
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:15,330
three.

3534
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:17,470
I got number three.

3535
01:47:17,850 --> 01:47:18,390
Yes, he does.

3536
01:47:18,610 --> 01:47:18,730
Okay.

3537
01:47:19,450 --> 01:47:21,050
What's yours, Nimi?

3538
01:47:22,450 --> 01:47:24,430
How do you know what tree is...

3539
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:26,890
Just follow your heart, Nimi.

3540
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:28,610
Follow your heart.

3541
01:47:29,170 --> 01:47:30,830
Wait, is there which way is...

3542
01:47:30,830 --> 01:47:34,830
Okay, we all have to stick together to go to our area anyway.

3543
01:47:35,150 --> 01:47:36,310
And then we'll all split up.

3544
01:47:37,170 --> 01:47:37,530
All right.

3545
01:47:38,270 --> 01:47:39,450
No, no, no, it's on the other side.

3546
01:47:39,550 --> 01:47:40,690
It's on the other side of the gates.

3547
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:42,430
It is?

3548
01:47:42,930 --> 01:47:44,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah, cuz there's only one tree.

3549
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:50,740
Wait, is it?

3550
01:47:55,170 --> 01:47:56,090
Wait, is it?

3551
01:47:57,710 --> 01:47:59,230
No, there isn't any here, yeah.

3552
01:47:59,230 --> 01:48:00,850
Okay, is it on the other side?

3553
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:07,230
I thought it was the...

3554
01:48:08,330 --> 01:48:10,030
I thought it was like here.

3555
01:48:11,650 --> 01:48:13,010
Is there any numbers here?

3556
01:48:13,570 --> 01:48:16,750
I'm following my own heart, but I think my heart is wrong.

3557
01:48:17,350 --> 01:48:17,610
Hello?

3558
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:19,850
I don't see any numbers.

3559
01:48:20,590 --> 01:48:22,810
I know, is it?

3560
01:48:23,010 --> 01:48:24,030
You're crazy.

3561
01:48:26,890 --> 01:48:27,990
No, I did!

3562
01:48:28,310 --> 01:48:29,290
I saw it!

3563
01:48:29,410 --> 01:48:30,550
I swear to God!

3564
01:48:30,930 --> 01:48:31,750
Wait, I'll show you.

3565
01:48:31,830 --> 01:48:32,750
I'll show you, Dewi.

3566
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:33,450
Come over here.

3567
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:33,890
Okay, okay.

3568
01:48:33,990 --> 01:48:34,490
I'll show you.

3569
01:48:34,610 --> 01:48:36,570
No, I swear I'm not crazy.

3570
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:39,370
I swear I saw it.

3571
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:40,750
We all saw it.

3572
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:44,650
We have to wait for this.

3573
01:48:44,990 --> 01:48:46,770
Maybe you have to shine the flashlight on it or something?

3574
01:48:47,230 --> 01:48:48,330
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3575
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:50,110
My flashlight was not on.

3576
01:48:52,450 --> 01:48:54,010
Okay, they're looking...

3577
01:48:54,010 --> 01:48:54,750
I don't think he sees us.

3578
01:48:55,550 --> 01:48:55,910
Okay.

3579
01:48:57,750 --> 01:48:58,670
Okay, he sees me.

3580
01:49:00,410 --> 01:49:01,950
I'm gonna freak his out.

3581
01:49:08,970 --> 01:49:10,010
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3582
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:11,350
Okay, we gotta get Mimi it back.

3583
01:49:12,710 --> 01:49:13,070
Hello.

3584
01:49:13,070 --> 01:49:13,090
Hello.

3585
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:14,110
Alright.

3586
01:49:15,850 --> 01:49:17,610
I can't find number one.

3587
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:22,420
Okay, but you guys saw the number, right?

3588
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:23,640
You guys saw my number, right?

3589
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:25,040
What?

3590
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:26,520
You guys saw my number, right?

3591
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:27,620
I'm not crazy, right?

3592
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:29,080
Y'all saw it.

3593
01:49:29,180 --> 01:49:30,280
No, I didn't see it.

3594
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:31,900
Okay, alright, come follow me.

3595
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:33,440
We're all gonna see it together.

3596
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:36,920
Maybe one person can only see one number on each tree.

3597
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:39,260
Okay, all of us, do you see this number?

3598
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:39,700
Oh!

3599
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:42,920
I thought you meant the glowing tree.

3600
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,260
Oh, three!

3601
01:49:44,860 --> 01:49:45,820
There's a three!

3602
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:49,740
Okay, let's check all the normal trees in this area, then.

3603
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:53,300
I knew I wasn't crazy.

3604
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:54,600
I knew.

3605
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:55,580
Yeah.

3606
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:56,940
Okay.

3607
01:49:57,340 --> 01:50:00,180
So, straight, whatever direction.

3608
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,820
This way, I was trying to find number one, but I couldn't find it.

3609
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:06,400
It has to be the other side of the gate.

3610
01:50:06,740 --> 01:50:06,980
You think so?

3611
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:07,940
Yeah, right?

3612
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:11,680
No, I think it can't be, because it would be too easy.

3613
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:15,920
Where would it be, then?

3614
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:18,160
I don't... I don't know, I was looking over here.

3615
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:20,020
I don't see any other number.

3616
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:24,820
Yeah, it's like, it's here.

3617
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:25,860
It is here.

3618
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,280
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

3619
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:29,360
Wait, what?

3620
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:29,920
Nine!

3621
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:30,740
Nine!

3622
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:31,060
Nine!

3623
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:31,120
Nine!

3624
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:31,540
What's your number?

3625
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:32,740
Nine!

3626
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:33,080
Nine!

3627
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:33,760
Where did you find it?

3628
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:34,200
Or six?

3629
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:35,520
Six or nine, right here.

3630
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:35,780
Oh, oh.

3631
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:36,520
Um, I think it's six.

3632
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:37,220
I think it's six.

3633
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:38,800
I think, I can't tell.

3634
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:39,760
I can't tell either.

3635
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:43,880
Oh, I missed it?

3636
01:50:47,630 --> 01:50:50,210
Oh my god, I don't remember what it was on the map.

3637
01:50:50,690 --> 01:50:52,470
I don't remember, I'm just gonna...

3638
01:50:52,470 --> 01:50:54,930
Maybe if I'm lucky, I'll find it on the floor.

3639
01:50:55,430 --> 01:50:55,850
I...

3640
01:50:55,850 --> 01:50:58,530
Maybe I'll just be very lucky.

3641
01:50:59,530 --> 01:51:00,950
And I'll find it.

3642
01:51:01,590 --> 01:51:02,070
Nine!

3643
01:51:02,810 --> 01:51:03,290
Nine!

3644
01:51:03,290 --> 01:51:03,430
Nine!

3645
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:10,690
Alright.

3646
01:51:11,970 --> 01:51:13,390
Hey, I find the...

3647
01:51:13,390 --> 01:51:15,590
I found the number, so I contributed.

3648
01:51:19,430 --> 01:51:19,760
Alright.

3649
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:21,580
We found two of them.

3650
01:51:23,780 --> 01:51:24,920
Wait, did...

3651
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:25,800
Did it miss that?

3652
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:28,220
Okay.

3653
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:28,640
Okay.

3654
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:28,840
Thank you!

3655
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:29,660
Okay.

3656
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:30,600
Let's see.

3657
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:32,680
Which one was yours though?

3658
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,080
Was it the one or the three?

3659
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:37,060
Oh, it's either six or nine.

3660
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:37,620
We don't know.

3661
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:38,980
It's six, it's six.

3662
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:40,140
Okay, yours is one.

3663
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:40,320
It's six, okay.

3664
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:41,840
Okay.

3665
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:42,660
Okay, so...

3666
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:44,780
Then three is like up ahead and...

3667
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:44,900
Okay.

3668
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:46,080
I pulled out my map.

3669
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:50,940
Three is close to one and five is also...

3670
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:52,740
They're in that kind of square little area.

3671
01:51:53,020 --> 01:51:55,460
If someone can lead the guy away, then...

3672
01:51:55,460 --> 01:51:56,060
I'll do it!

3673
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:56,980
You will?

3674
01:51:57,060 --> 01:51:58,020
I believe in you!

3675
01:51:58,140 --> 01:51:58,720
Wait, where is he?

3676
01:51:59,240 --> 01:51:59,580
The hero!

3677
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:00,780
Wait, where is he?

3678
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:03,580
Oh, he's over where we need to go.

3679
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:04,060
Just kidding.

3680
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:04,660
Yeah.

3681
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:12,040
Okay.

3682
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:14,420
It's right...

3683
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:15,300
Somewhere here.

3684
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:22,520
Or here?

3685
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:34,340
There's one more we're missing.

3686
01:52:41,030 --> 01:52:42,830
And then one should be here, right?

3687
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:48,340
Where was the five?

3688
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:49,840
Oh, I found one!

3689
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:50,420
I found one!

3690
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:51,860
Nine!

3691
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:54,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3692
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:54,840
It's...

3693
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:56,220
It's a nine or a six.

3694
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:58,840
Okay, we'll figure that out later.

3695
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,380
It's a six or a...

3696
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:04,960
Oh my god, Doobie's still doing it!

3697
01:53:05,140 --> 01:53:05,860
Oh my god!

3698
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:07,480
She's a hero, Doobie!

3699
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:08,720
She's a hero!

3700
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:10,920
Oh my god!

3701
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:11,860
Doobie!

3702
01:53:12,540 --> 01:53:13,080
Doobie!

3703
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:16,020
Where's Doobie?

3704
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:17,580
Okay.

3705
01:53:17,820 --> 01:53:19,780
It's a six or a nine.

3706
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:20,980
At the far end.

3707
01:53:21,140 --> 01:53:22,340
That would be the fourth digit.

3708
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:23,080
Okay.

3709
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:24,060
The fourth one?

3710
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:25,340
Yeah, so...

3711
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:26,560
I don't know...

3712
01:53:26,940 --> 01:53:27,300
Oh!

3713
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:27,940
We did it!

3714
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:28,960
We did it!

3715
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:31,660
Yay!

3716
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:33,200
I think we beat the game!

3717
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:34,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3718
01:53:34,660 --> 01:53:35,300
We can beat the game!

3719
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:36,780
We can beat the game!

3720
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:39,020
Wait, should we save again?

3721
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:40,260
Oh yeah, we should save again.

3722
01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:40,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3723
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:41,580
That's a good idea.

3724
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:42,220
Good idea.

3725
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:45,320
Nice.

3726
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:46,180
Alright.

3727
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:46,800
Let's go.

3728
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,220
Let's go save the moon.

3729
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:50,560
Get rid of the moon!

3730
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:51,420
Get rid of the creatures!

3731
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:52,300
Yeah!

3732
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:53,820
Then we'll bring the...

3733
01:53:53,820 --> 01:53:55,800
We'll have two moons on Earth, guys!

3734
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:58,080
Two moons!

3735
01:53:58,820 --> 01:53:59,680
Double the waves!

3736
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:00,520
Just keep running!

3737
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:01,600
Just don't...

3738
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,620
Ignore this blood stick behind you.

3739
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:04,300
Just keep running.

3740
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:07,060
Okay, we're good.

3741
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:08,820
Yeah, we're fine.

3742
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:11,960
Wait, is this the one that we have to do inside?

3743
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:12,660
The left door?

3744
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:12,840
No, no, no.

3745
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:13,920
It's out here.

3746
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:17,900
Am I holding it still?

3747
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:18,540
Yeah, I am.

3748
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:19,340
Okay, I was like...

3749
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:19,880
Where is it?

3750
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:21,480
Oh, it's this one.

3751
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:21,880
That's right.

3752
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:23,260
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited!

3753
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:24,680
Ready?

3754
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:26,020
Wait, wait.

3755
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,880
Wait, I don't know actually if this ends the game, but...

3756
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:30,440
I hope so!

3757
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:31,160
Alright.

3758
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:35,160
Not that I'm not enjoying my time spent with you all.

3759
01:54:35,260 --> 01:54:36,280
Yeah, I was like...

3760
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:37,520
We just want to see the moon!

3761
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:38,040
Yeah!

3762
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:39,500
I'm going in.

3763
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:40,720
Come on!

3764
01:54:41,580 --> 01:54:42,360
It won't let me.

3765
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:43,560
Oh?

3766
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:46,820
Open the hatches?

3767
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:48,560
Is it gonna come out?

3768
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:49,680
Wait, it's coming!

3769
01:54:49,860 --> 01:54:50,320
It's coming out!

3770
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:51,760
The moon is rising!

3771
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:52,840
The moon is rising!

3772
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:54,060
Oh!

3773
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:55,180
Oh!

3774
01:54:56,420 --> 01:54:56,520
Oh!

3775
01:55:05,580 --> 01:55:06,060
Oh!

3776
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:06,840
Oh, sorry guys, team...

3777
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:07,260
Get on!

3778
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:08,660
Oh my god, you're right!

3779
01:55:09,780 --> 01:55:12,460
So are you guys team Jacob or Edward, guys?

3780
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:13,600
Are you...

3781
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:13,840
Oh.

3782
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:15,220
Obviously.

3783
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:16,820
Whoa.

3784
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:17,560
Whoa!

3785
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:18,340
Oh!

3786
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:19,940
Look, it's sucking the creatures in!

3787
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:21,020
It's sucking the creatures in!

3788
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:21,500
Oh!

3789
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:21,640
Wait!

3790
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:23,860
My girlfriend wants to talk to me.

3791
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:24,620
Sorry, hold on.

3792
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:25,940
Wait, why did the moon even glow?

3793
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:28,040
Wait!

3794
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:29,260
Guys, it's not over.

3795
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:32,660
Is this a moonrise?

3796
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:33,540
Oh!

3797
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:34,340
That's what she just said.

3798
01:55:34,420 --> 01:55:35,840
We got everything done, didn't we?

3799
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:36,220
No!

3800
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:37,960
It's also...

3801
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:39,080
There's an energy dome.

3802
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:40,400
Oh my god!

3803
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:42,540
We were so close!

3804
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:44,540
But it says two out of two.

3805
01:55:44,860 --> 01:55:45,640
And one out of one.

3806
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:48,520
Oh, I think it's everywhere we've been to.

3807
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:49,540
And then we just like...

3808
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:50,540
Okay.

3809
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:51,260
Oh, we...

3810
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:52,640
Wait, what's the energy?

3811
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:54,000
We just press the button.

3812
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:54,540
Oh!

3813
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:55,180
Look at the map!

3814
01:55:55,220 --> 01:55:55,600
Look at the map!

3815
01:55:57,420 --> 01:55:58,630
Oh, the valves!

3816
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:01,240
Oh, that's what they are for.

3817
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:01,760
Yeah.

3818
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:02,780
So there's one...

3819
01:56:02,780 --> 01:56:03,120
Inside.

3820
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:04,060
Inside here?

3821
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:04,480
Yeah.

3822
01:56:04,820 --> 01:56:05,740
But you gotta be careful.

3823
01:56:06,380 --> 01:56:07,480
Oh, so that's not too hard.

3824
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:10,180
Okay.

3825
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,040
Okay, one of us has...

3826
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:13,220
Oh!

3827
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:16,860
Our wife will save us.

3828
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:18,760
Did he save us?

3829
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:23,380
Oh!

3830
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:32,180
The brain.

3831
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:33,180
The brain.

3832
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:35,740
I got it though.

3833
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:36,920
Did I do it?

3834
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:38,480
I can do the same point over here.

3835
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:39,340
The first one, I think.

3836
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:40,640
I did it.

3837
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:42,740
I was a hero.

3838
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:45,860
Wait, open the map.

3839
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:46,560
Yeah.

3840
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:47,280
My...

3841
01:56:49,510 --> 01:56:50,450
Right here.

3842
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:51,470
Oh!

3843
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:52,150
We're back.

3844
01:56:52,850 --> 01:56:53,670
Okay, I got...

3845
01:56:53,670 --> 01:56:54,670
I got one of the valve.

3846
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:57,910
My game crashed.

3847
01:57:04,830 --> 01:57:05,990
My game crashed!

3848
01:57:08,830 --> 01:57:10,170
Kept putting it back up.

3849
01:57:10,530 --> 01:57:11,270
Okay, it's okay.

3850
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:12,090
We saved though.

3851
01:57:12,310 --> 01:57:12,850
We saved.

3852
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:15,710
But we saved, so we shouldn't be...

3853
01:57:15,710 --> 01:57:16,750
So we...

3854
01:57:18,290 --> 01:57:19,870
Are they still in game?

3855
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:20,090
Are they still in game?

3856
01:57:20,090 --> 01:57:21,090
Did they all got kicked out?

3857
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:23,490
They all got kicked out.

3858
01:57:25,410 --> 01:57:27,610
I hope that they get kicked out.

3859
01:57:28,190 --> 01:57:28,330
Alright.

3860
01:57:33,310 --> 01:57:34,370
Oh, oh!

3861
01:57:34,870 --> 01:57:34,990
Wait.

3862
01:57:35,830 --> 01:57:36,530
Okay, okay.

3863
01:57:37,150 --> 01:57:37,410
Alright.

3864
01:57:39,130 --> 01:57:39,730
Alright.

3865
01:57:41,250 --> 01:57:42,210
There we go.

3866
01:57:42,210 --> 01:57:43,490
There we go.

3867
01:57:43,990 --> 01:57:44,170
There we go.

3868
01:57:44,170 --> 01:57:44,210
Okay.

3869
01:57:44,290 --> 01:57:45,630
We can at least be our colors now.

3870
01:57:46,250 --> 01:57:47,090
At least...

3871
01:57:47,090 --> 01:57:49,030
Guys, at least we can be our colors now.

3872
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:50,030
Hello?

3873
01:57:50,390 --> 01:57:51,810
My game actually crashed.

3874
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:52,210
Hello?

3875
01:57:52,590 --> 01:57:53,270
Oh my god.

3876
01:57:53,530 --> 01:57:54,330
It was the moon.

3877
01:57:54,390 --> 01:57:55,350
It was the moon.

3878
01:57:56,410 --> 01:57:57,010
It's okay.

3879
01:57:57,030 --> 01:57:57,430
It's okay.

3880
01:57:57,430 --> 01:57:57,770
For the...

3881
01:57:57,770 --> 01:57:59,070
We can at least be our colors now.

3882
01:58:00,930 --> 01:58:01,350
Oh!

3883
01:58:01,730 --> 01:58:03,070
I didn't get to change!

3884
01:58:04,190 --> 01:58:04,610
Wait.

3885
01:58:04,710 --> 01:58:05,650
What happened to the numbers?

3886
01:58:05,930 --> 01:58:06,430
They changed.

3887
01:58:06,910 --> 01:58:07,490
Did they change?

3888
01:58:08,610 --> 01:58:09,010
Yeah, they did.

3889
01:58:09,010 --> 01:58:09,170
No, no.

3890
01:58:09,230 --> 01:58:09,730
It's the same.

3891
01:58:11,010 --> 01:58:11,430
It's...

3892
01:58:12,250 --> 01:58:12,670
102.

3893
01:58:14,550 --> 01:58:15,390
Yeah, the valve is here.

3894
01:58:15,390 --> 01:58:16,490
Mine was messed up then.

3895
01:58:16,730 --> 01:58:16,810
Before.

3896
01:58:17,010 --> 01:58:19,190
I was excited about me and my color.

3897
01:58:20,230 --> 01:58:20,670
Yeah.

3898
01:58:23,150 --> 01:58:25,270
That's why I pressed start.

3899
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:29,570
Wait, where's that?

3900
01:58:29,970 --> 01:58:30,610
There's one in a...

3901
01:58:31,190 --> 01:58:32,510
There's one like right here.

3902
01:58:32,690 --> 01:58:34,090
But how do we get to one of these?

3903
01:58:35,310 --> 01:58:35,750
Wait.

3904
01:58:35,990 --> 01:58:36,530
Oh yeah, it's right there.

3905
01:58:36,710 --> 01:58:36,990
It's glowing.

3906
01:58:37,970 --> 01:58:39,070
How do we get there?

3907
01:58:39,650 --> 01:58:40,970
We just go over here, I think.

3908
01:58:40,970 --> 01:58:41,950
We just go in, right?

3909
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:42,630
Oh.

3910
01:58:43,250 --> 01:58:44,050
You're so smart.

3911
01:58:44,990 --> 01:58:45,650
Oh my god.

3912
01:58:46,070 --> 01:58:46,370
Nice.

3913
01:58:46,370 --> 01:58:47,550
Don't worry guys.

3914
01:58:47,670 --> 01:58:48,290
I'll get this way.

3915
01:58:48,490 --> 01:58:49,690
Oh, the second floor and basement.

3916
01:58:50,730 --> 01:58:51,030
So...

3917
01:58:51,030 --> 01:58:52,530
Wait, I'm just announcing two out of two.

3918
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:52,950
Oh.

3919
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:55,810
Is it supposed to be like this the whole time?

3920
01:58:56,050 --> 01:58:56,930
Guys, we gotta go...

3921
01:58:56,930 --> 01:58:59,250
Go to the second floor or the basement.

3922
01:59:00,230 --> 01:59:00,670
Okay.

3923
01:59:00,870 --> 01:59:01,490
It's this way.

3924
01:59:03,290 --> 01:59:04,430
I believe in a...

3925
01:59:04,430 --> 01:59:05,350
Wait, is it this way?

3926
01:59:05,430 --> 01:59:06,290
Wait, I didn't see anything.

3927
01:59:08,730 --> 01:59:09,570
Wait, where...

3928
01:59:09,570 --> 01:59:10,250
Where is...

3929
01:59:10,250 --> 01:59:11,590
Wasn't this the basement over here?

3930
01:59:11,790 --> 01:59:11,810
No.

3931
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:12,570
Yeah, where's this...

3932
01:59:12,570 --> 01:59:13,370
Where's the...

3933
01:59:13,370 --> 01:59:15,210
The door for the basement?

3934
01:59:15,210 --> 01:59:15,710
I...

3935
01:59:15,710 --> 01:59:16,730
Isn't it right here?

3936
01:59:17,010 --> 01:59:18,090
Oh, here, here.

3937
01:59:18,190 --> 01:59:18,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3938
01:59:19,490 --> 01:59:19,790
Right here.

3939
01:59:19,910 --> 01:59:20,070
Okay.

3940
01:59:20,770 --> 01:59:21,970
We found one over here.

3941
01:59:22,410 --> 01:59:22,670
Yeah.

3942
01:59:24,530 --> 01:59:25,010
Okay.

3943
01:59:25,350 --> 01:59:26,230
Watch out, that guy.

3944
01:59:26,350 --> 01:59:26,890
Oh, hi.

3945
01:59:27,470 --> 01:59:27,590
Hey.

3946
01:59:27,710 --> 01:59:32,090
Guys, we never found the map data for the basement.

3947
01:59:32,650 --> 01:59:32,670
Oh no.

3948
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:33,490
Oh.

3949
01:59:35,110 --> 01:59:35,690
Is it this?

3950
01:59:35,690 --> 01:59:36,770
Wait, but it's like right by the...

3951
01:59:36,770 --> 01:59:38,450
I remember seeing it right by the door.

3952
01:59:39,170 --> 01:59:39,870
Oh, okay.

3953
01:59:40,190 --> 01:59:40,450
Yeah.

3954
01:59:41,170 --> 01:59:41,410
Yeah.

3955
01:59:41,910 --> 01:59:43,350
Basement or basement two?

3956
01:59:45,690 --> 01:59:47,990
I did basement two because you said second floor basement.

3957
01:59:49,010 --> 01:59:49,370
Oh.

3958
01:59:49,390 --> 01:59:50,050
Oh, it is.

3959
01:59:50,350 --> 01:59:51,030
Second floor basement.

3960
01:59:51,050 --> 01:59:51,130
See?

3961
01:59:51,510 --> 01:59:52,190
Open the map.

3962
01:59:53,170 --> 01:59:53,230
Oh.

3963
01:59:53,850 --> 01:59:54,330
This way.

3964
01:59:54,410 --> 01:59:54,630
This way.

3965
01:59:54,730 --> 01:59:55,030
This way.

3966
01:59:56,010 --> 01:59:56,770
Okay, be careful.

3967
01:59:57,250 --> 02:00:00,610
Oh, we have to go past...

3968
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:02,150
We have to go past...

3969
02:00:02,150 --> 02:00:02,570
Oh, he's right there.

3970
02:00:02,710 --> 02:00:03,090
He's right there.

3971
02:00:03,610 --> 02:00:03,970
Wait, no.

3972
02:00:04,010 --> 02:00:04,550
We go forward.

3973
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:05,210
We go forward.

3974
02:00:06,930 --> 02:00:07,650
Run past it!

3975
02:00:07,730 --> 02:00:08,310
Run past it!

3976
02:00:09,030 --> 02:00:10,290
Alright, we'll go forward.

3977
02:00:10,610 --> 02:00:10,970
We can get it.

3978
02:00:14,090 --> 02:00:14,450
Okay.

3979
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:17,910
I got it!

3980
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,320
I wonder if she's dead.

3981
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:38,820
I wonder if she's...

3982
02:00:38,820 --> 02:00:42,080
Nibi, thank you for being a hero, Nibi.

3983
02:00:42,580 --> 02:00:42,700
Oh, okay.

3984
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:44,300
Thank you for both heroes.

3985
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:47,940
All heroes.

3986
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:48,960
Yeah!

3987
02:00:49,340 --> 02:00:50,020
Yeah, heroes.

3988
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:50,460
Heroes in grey!

3989
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,080
Guys, heroes never die, guys.

3990
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:54,220
True.

3991
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:55,760
Okay, second floor.

3992
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:56,560
So now...

3993
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:57,300
Second floor.

3994
02:00:58,080 --> 02:00:59,340
Oh, it's like right here.

3995
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:00,960
Oh, easy.

3996
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:01,580
Yeah.

3997
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:04,820
Alright.

3998
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:06,300
We should've bought the orange thing.

3999
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:06,840
Oh, yeah.

4000
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:07,440
We should've...

4001
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:08,080
We left it.

4002
02:01:08,820 --> 02:01:09,240
Got it?

4003
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:10,600
I thought the game was...

4004
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:11,600
And then we go to the moon?

4005
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:12,280
We got it?

4006
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:12,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4007
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:14,740
It was so close.

4008
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:15,820
We did it!

4009
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:16,360
We did it!

4010
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:16,540
We did it!

4011
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:17,720
yz yz yz yz we missed it!

4012
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:18,460
We're gonna miss it!

4013
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:19,120
We're gonna miss it!

4014
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:19,720
We're gonna miss it!

4015
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:20,400
Come on, we're gonna fuck!

4016
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:22,420
OOOOOX!!!

4017
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:24,380
There it goes!

4018
02:01:24,580 --> 02:01:25,100
There it goes!

4019
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:26,500
Oh my god, it's beautiful!

4020
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:28,460
It's so beautiful!

4021
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:32,220
Oh my god, it will rise to a level where you can approach it and take flight.

4022
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:33,500
Wait, do we have to go to the ceiling?

4023
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:34,680
The roof?

4024
02:01:35,340 --> 02:01:35,660
What?

4025
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:36,800
That's what the manager just said.

4026
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:38,380
How do we get to the roof?

4027
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:41,860
Uh...

4028
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:43,460
It's going to the moon.

4029
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:45,600
The moon will push...

4030
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:48,420
Outside, this way, this way, this way.

4031
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:50,580
Remember, it's the meow, the meow-meows.

4032
02:01:50,980 --> 02:01:51,540
The little cats.

4033
02:01:51,820 --> 02:01:52,240
Meow-meows.

4034
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:53,840
Meow-meows.

4035
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,580
Oh, there it is.

4036
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:00,480
Okay, maybe not the meow-meows.

4037
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:01,620
Yeah, you're going the wrong way.

4038
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:02,880
Oh my god.

4039
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:06,940
Okay, there's someone else lead.

4040
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:09,520
Yeah, someone with the map.

4041
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:10,980
Nini, we nominate you.

4042
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:11,440
It's this way.

4043
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:12,580
It's this way.

4044
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:14,440
Right?

4045
02:02:15,160 --> 02:02:15,600
Yeah.

4046
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:17,520
Oh, yeah, yeah.

4047
02:02:17,740 --> 02:02:18,140
In here, this way.

4048
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:19,120
That way?

4049
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:21,160
This way.

4050
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:23,680
And then, left?

4051
02:02:23,820 --> 02:02:24,800
This way, left.

4052
02:02:28,350 --> 02:02:29,770
And it's like right in front of us.

4053
02:02:29,850 --> 02:02:30,210
Oh, right here.

4054
02:02:30,490 --> 02:02:30,590
Oh.

4055
02:02:30,830 --> 02:02:31,850
Oh, is this always here?

4056
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:32,470
Yeah.

4057
02:02:33,090 --> 02:02:34,110
Um, yeah.

4058
02:02:34,730 --> 02:02:36,470
You just never see this elevator?

4059
02:02:38,910 --> 02:02:39,630
Wait, did I?

4060
02:02:40,010 --> 02:02:40,510
Oh, it's coming.

4061
02:02:40,770 --> 02:02:42,090
Yeah, yeah, it's just a little slow.

4062
02:02:42,370 --> 02:02:43,390
Don't let that guy in.

4063
02:02:43,510 --> 02:02:44,150
He's creepy.

4064
02:02:44,150 --> 02:02:45,370
Okay, close it.

4065
02:02:45,650 --> 02:02:45,850
We don't.

4066
02:02:45,850 --> 02:02:46,710
I got the roof.

4067
02:02:47,290 --> 02:02:48,810
That could be Ray's right now.

4068
02:02:49,010 --> 02:02:49,770
You don't know that.

4069
02:02:50,050 --> 02:02:50,230
Right?

4070
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:51,930
Ray?

4071
02:02:52,190 --> 02:02:52,470
Yeah.

4072
02:02:52,630 --> 02:02:53,690
He's been with us the whole time.

4073
02:02:53,690 --> 02:02:55,090
Yeah, he's been with us.

4074
02:02:55,390 --> 02:02:56,610
That's a little scary though.

4075
02:02:57,030 --> 02:02:57,390
Yeah.

4076
02:02:58,110 --> 02:02:58,430
Whoa.

4077
02:02:58,870 --> 02:02:59,190
Oh.

4078
02:02:59,490 --> 02:03:00,330
It's the cat!

4079
02:03:01,790 --> 02:03:02,690
Oh, the cat!

4080
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:03,470
Oh, the cat!

4081
02:03:03,770 --> 02:03:04,570
The cat's here.

4082
02:03:04,890 --> 02:03:05,450
Can we talk to him?

4083
02:03:05,450 --> 02:03:08,170
Fly away with the moon is our objective.

4084
02:03:11,150 --> 02:03:12,490
Did we talk to the cat?

4085
02:03:12,690 --> 02:03:12,730
Get in!

4086
02:03:13,330 --> 02:03:13,910
Oh, the wife?

4087
02:03:15,130 --> 02:03:15,550
Oh.

4088
02:03:15,550 --> 02:03:17,150
Yeah, I see our Santa over there.

4089
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:17,530
Oh.

4090
02:03:18,730 --> 02:03:20,030
She's coming home with me!

4091
02:03:20,230 --> 02:03:22,590
You're gonna pick us up and spin us and throw us into the moon.

4092
02:03:23,790 --> 02:03:25,050
I hope so, actually.

4093
02:03:25,530 --> 02:03:26,790
Hello, giant woman.

4094
02:03:27,110 --> 02:03:27,730
All right, mince.

4095
02:03:27,810 --> 02:03:28,110
Oh, okay.

4096
02:03:28,110 --> 02:03:28,730
Your wife time.

4097
02:03:29,470 --> 02:03:32,010
She says, it seems like this is the end.

4098
02:03:32,470 --> 02:03:34,910
The moon is already waiting for you.

4099
02:03:36,150 --> 02:03:37,910
And yet, you managed to pull it off.

4100
02:03:38,710 --> 02:03:39,510
That's it.

4101
02:03:40,570 --> 02:03:41,570
We're going home.

4102
02:03:41,630 --> 02:03:42,990
Fly away now!

4103
02:03:43,730 --> 02:03:44,310
Fly away!

4104
02:03:44,530 --> 02:03:46,250
Will you come fly with me?

4105
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:47,110
Fly away!

4106
02:03:48,110 --> 02:03:51,350
I wish I could, but I have to stay behind.

4107
02:03:52,210 --> 02:03:56,730
I don't have a fancy space suit like yours, so I can't brave the great unknown.

4108
02:03:57,230 --> 02:03:57,550
She's a robot.

4109
02:03:57,550 --> 02:03:58,730
She's still talking?

4110
02:03:58,910 --> 02:03:59,230
My girl!

4111
02:03:59,230 --> 02:04:00,110
Goodbye, forever.

4112
02:04:00,990 --> 02:04:01,470
Yeah.

4113
02:04:02,030 --> 02:04:04,010
She doesn't want to come to the space with us.

4114
02:04:04,650 --> 02:04:05,930
You're not gonna come to space with us?

4115
02:04:06,030 --> 02:04:06,790
Go on, sweetie!

4116
02:04:07,770 --> 02:04:08,250
No!

4117
02:04:11,350 --> 02:04:12,650
There's a bridge here!

4118
02:04:14,430 --> 02:04:16,130
Mint, what's your final words to your wife?

4119
02:04:18,110 --> 02:04:18,970
Careful, careful!

4120
02:04:19,530 --> 02:04:21,250
I love you in latex.

4121
02:04:21,690 --> 02:04:24,210
It's time to say goodbye to this place and move on.

4122
02:04:24,390 --> 02:04:25,570
I'm not ready.

4123
02:04:26,010 --> 02:04:26,210
No!

4124
02:04:28,390 --> 02:04:30,050
Okay, that's the last thing she says.

4125
02:04:30,530 --> 02:04:31,130
It's time, guys.

4126
02:04:31,150 --> 02:04:31,950
Are we all ready?

4127
02:04:32,490 --> 02:04:32,970
Yeah!

4128
02:04:33,310 --> 02:04:33,850
Let's go!

4129
02:04:34,350 --> 02:04:35,470
We're doing it!

4130
02:04:35,610 --> 02:04:36,970
Don't ever forget you, space lady!

4131
02:04:37,930 --> 02:04:41,610
Thank you for making her the happiest mint around.

4132
02:04:44,690 --> 02:04:47,170
I'll never forget the bachelor party.

4133
02:04:48,630 --> 02:04:51,050
Wait, are we actually gonna see space now?

4134
02:04:51,230 --> 02:04:51,910
That'd be crazy.

4135
02:04:52,330 --> 02:04:54,850
I mean, that's why we put on the space suit.

4136
02:04:55,910 --> 02:04:56,930
Yeah, there we go.

4137
02:04:57,090 --> 02:04:57,770
Are you guys ready?

4138
02:04:57,970 --> 02:04:59,730
It looks even a little small for all of us.

4139
02:04:59,750 --> 02:05:00,730
Set out on a journey.

4140
02:05:01,010 --> 02:05:01,550
I know, right?

4141
02:05:02,590 --> 02:05:04,090
We're gonna live inside of it.

4142
02:05:04,430 --> 02:05:05,390
We all have to be nearby.

4143
02:05:09,150 --> 02:05:09,570
Oh?

4144
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:16,400
Oh my god.

4145
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,300
We're each having our own little experience.

4146
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:23,500
We're flying away now!

4147
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:26,780
Our people need me!

4148
02:05:26,780 --> 02:05:26,980
Wee!

4149
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:32,580
Goodbye, mince wife!

4150
02:05:34,520 --> 02:05:35,600
Goodbye!

4151
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:40,240
Wee!

4152
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:45,020
The mission is complete!

4153
02:05:45,020 --> 02:05:45,940
Thanks, manager!

4154
02:05:49,460 --> 02:05:51,160
We did it!

4155
02:05:53,740 --> 02:05:56,040
We finally got the moon!

4156
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:00,820
Oh my god!

4157
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:02,660
It's so beautiful!

4158
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:06,120
We actually beat the game!

4159
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:12,600
I also understood nothing.

4160
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:13,300
I, I...

4161
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:17,480
That was a wild game.

4162
02:06:17,940 --> 02:06:20,020
That game was fucking wild.

4163
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:23,600
Hello?

4164
02:06:23,940 --> 02:06:24,260
Oh!

4165
02:06:24,280 --> 02:06:24,880
Oh!

4166
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:24,980
Hello!

4167
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:25,800
Hello!

4168
02:06:26,500 --> 02:06:27,160
We're back?

4169
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:28,460
How do we...

4170
02:06:28,460 --> 02:06:29,760
Wait, why are we back?

4171
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:30,300
What?

4172
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:31,480
I thought we flew...

4173
02:06:31,480 --> 02:06:32,480
New game plans!

4174
02:06:32,820 --> 02:06:34,620
I thought we all flew away!

4175
02:06:35,700 --> 02:06:36,260
We're back!

4176
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:37,180
What happened?

4177
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:38,500
Where is...

4178
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:40,220
The creatures are still here even.

4179
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:42,560
Wait, like...

4180
02:06:43,020 --> 02:06:44,080
Did we not...

4181
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:45,060
We beat the game though!

4182
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:46,860
Yeah, we beat it.

4183
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:47,620
We beat it!

4184
02:06:47,620 --> 02:06:48,000
We beat it!

4185
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:49,000
Yeah!

4186
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:49,220
Yeah!

4187
02:06:50,180 --> 02:06:51,180
Like, it was...

4188
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:52,880
We got kicked off the moon?

4189
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:53,640
The cat!

4190
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:53,880
Wait!

4191
02:06:54,980 --> 02:06:55,480
Oh!

4192
02:06:55,800 --> 02:06:55,820
Wait!

4193
02:06:55,940 --> 02:06:56,780
The cat!

4194
02:06:57,200 --> 02:06:57,700
Hello?

4195
02:06:58,620 --> 02:06:59,460
Oh, scary!

4196
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:01,260
Aw, he's happy!

4197
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:02,400
Aw, he's not...

4198
02:07:03,100 --> 02:07:04,740
He's not evil anymore!

4199
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:06,100
Is the moon up there?

4200
02:07:06,100 --> 02:07:07,280
Wait, maybe...

4201
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:08,860
Maybe this was for like...

4202
02:07:08,860 --> 02:07:09,060
Uh...

4203
02:07:09,060 --> 02:07:09,940
The TV head guy.

4204
02:07:10,100 --> 02:07:12,300
If you put the orange on his head when the moon is already out.

4205
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:13,340
Then he...

4206
02:07:13,340 --> 02:07:14,840
Like, lives on the moon with us.

4207
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,220
But since we did it early...

4208
02:07:16,220 --> 02:07:17,500
He just floated off into...

4209
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:17,520
Oh!

4210
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:18,100
He's just...

4211
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:18,320
Space!

4212
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:24,220
We did the order of operations a little wrong.

4213
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:25,220
Yeah...

4214
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:28,280
Wait, I thought the creatures were supposed to be gone though.

4215
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:29,640
I still see them walking around.

4216
02:07:29,740 --> 02:07:31,780
Oh wait, there's two TV heads here we could talk to.

4217
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:32,120
Oh!

4218
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:33,180
Oh yeah!

4219
02:07:33,940 --> 02:07:34,360
Strange.

4220
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:35,420
Strange.

4221
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:37,440
You left with the moon, didn't you?

4222
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:37,660
You left with the moon, didn't you?

4223
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:38,140
Oh, they're acknowledging it.

4224
02:07:38,160 --> 02:07:39,240
Yeah, we thought so!

4225
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:40,980
Yeah, we all floated away!

4226
02:07:41,120 --> 02:07:41,300
Yeah!

4227
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:45,260
Did we forget to finish something?

4228
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:47,960
Oh, I guess it's New Game Plus and we didn't do...

4229
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:49,560
No moon here anymore!

4230
02:07:49,980 --> 02:07:50,160
Aww!

4231
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:51,860
That was fun guys!

4232
02:07:52,340 --> 02:07:53,600
I had a fun time!

4233
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:54,260
Yeah!

4234
02:07:54,900 --> 02:07:57,260
I told you the yellow women had a plan!

4235
02:07:58,040 --> 02:07:58,420
Uh huh!

4236
02:07:58,560 --> 02:07:59,700
Yeah, mhm, mhm, mhm.

4237
02:07:59,700 --> 02:08:01,660
That was faster than I thought it would be!

4238
02:08:01,940 --> 02:08:02,900
Yeah, I thought so, yeah!

4239
02:08:02,900 --> 02:08:04,440
Even if this guy on YouTube only one hour...

4240
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:05,140
Yeah, yeah!

4241
02:08:05,580 --> 02:08:07,200
He had all the information, okay!

4242
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:08,040
Okay, yeah, yeah!

4243
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:08,380
We...

4244
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:10,860
We figured it out as we went along!

4245
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:12,980
See, never dealt our plan!

4246
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:13,640
Never!

4247
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:16,380
It was good, it was good!

4248
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:16,920
Yeah, yeah!

4249
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:17,220
Yeah!

4250
02:08:17,300 --> 02:08:18,140
Yeah, I had a fun time!

4251
02:08:18,300 --> 02:08:19,460
With all of you guys today!

4252
02:08:20,060 --> 02:08:21,320
Yeah, and also like...

4253
02:08:21,320 --> 02:08:21,360
Yeah!

4254
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:22,800
When we first started the game...

4255
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:23,480
I did not ex...

4256
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:24,080
I...

4257
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:25,860
Honestly, I don't know what we just did.

4258
02:08:26,180 --> 02:08:26,880
Like, I...

4259
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:29,380
I'm a little confused on the plot of the story.

4260
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:30,260
Yeah, me too!

4261
02:08:30,940 --> 02:08:34,360
What we did is played more than two hours, so we can never return the game.

4262
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:37,800
No, it was cool, though.

4263
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:38,340
It was cool.

4264
02:08:38,580 --> 02:08:40,060
Maybe they'll add more to it.

4265
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:41,400
Maybe they'll add a second moon.

4266
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:42,540
You know what I mean?

4267
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:43,100
Oh no!

4268
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:43,960
DLC.

4269
02:08:44,380 --> 02:08:45,480
The moon DLC.

4270
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:47,600
Some of those bosses, I never want to see again.

4271
02:08:47,740 --> 02:08:48,280
I think I'm good.

4272
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:48,860
Yeah.

4273
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:50,680
Yeah, the one that like...

4274
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:52,360
Just like, punts us to the ground.

4275
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:53,060
That...

4276
02:08:53,060 --> 02:08:55,180
I know, that guy is horrible.

4277
02:08:57,100 --> 02:09:00,020
Like, look, he always comes out of nowhere, too.

4278
02:09:00,220 --> 02:09:02,240
Like, we don't even know when he shows up.

4279
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:04,020
I wish we could see the...

4280
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:06,160
Like, a death count of who died the moon.

4281
02:09:06,380 --> 02:09:09,100
Oh, I'm pretty sure someone in our chat can...

4282
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:09,760
I know, right?

4283
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:11,440
Like, do a compilation of that.

4284
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:12,960
Like, who died the moon.

4285
02:09:13,260 --> 02:09:14,160
It has time, yeah.

4286
02:09:15,740 --> 02:09:17,380
Me and Nimi are in sync.

4287
02:09:17,740 --> 02:09:18,160
Whoa!

4288
02:09:18,540 --> 02:09:19,120
Oh my gosh!

4289
02:09:19,320 --> 02:09:20,020
Yeah, you guys are!

4290
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:24,220
We should line up.

4291
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:26,820
We should like, line up on the edge of the building and do like a...

4292
02:09:26,820 --> 02:09:27,200
Oh!

4293
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:27,840
A little...

4294
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:28,800
A synced dance.

4295
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:29,440
That's so true!

4296
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:30,240
But which dance?

4297
02:09:30,860 --> 02:09:31,660
A Macarena?

4298
02:09:32,760 --> 02:09:33,560
A Macarena?

4299
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:35,000
Which number?

4300
02:09:35,240 --> 02:09:35,840
Let's do like...

4301
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:36,720
I'll stand right here, fine.

4302
02:09:36,860 --> 02:09:37,640
Wait, which number?

4303
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:39,440
Which number?

4304
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:40,940
Which way do we face?

4305
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:42,020
Do we face...

4306
02:09:42,620 --> 02:09:43,880
Maybe in a line, like, yeah.

4307
02:09:44,100 --> 02:09:44,500
Like that?

4308
02:09:44,780 --> 02:09:45,020
Okay.

4309
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:46,960
Someone has to tell us the number to do.

4310
02:09:47,900 --> 02:09:48,080
Yeah.

4311
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:48,520
Wait, which way?

4312
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:50,900
Which way do we look...

4313
02:09:50,900 --> 02:09:51,000
Yeah, yeah.

4314
02:09:51,460 --> 02:09:52,100
He's looking.

4315
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:55,460
Alright, alright, alright.

4316
02:09:55,460 --> 02:09:55,940
How about...

4317
02:09:56,360 --> 02:09:56,780
Whatever.

4318
02:09:56,780 --> 02:09:57,320
What dance.

4319
02:09:57,960 --> 02:09:58,640
Is it dance 2?

4320
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:00,540
No, that's the chicken dance.

4321
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:09,160
Okay, okay.

4322
02:10:09,340 --> 02:10:10,220
We'll do a countdown.

4323
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:10,900
Are you guys ready?

4324
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:11,940
Okay.

4325
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:12,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4326
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:14,080
It stands two.

4327
02:10:14,260 --> 02:10:14,800
Yeah, are you ready?

4328
02:10:15,180 --> 02:10:15,540
Three.

4329
02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:17,120
Wait, how do I... wait, hold on.

4330
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:18,260
Oh, I gotta stop.

4331
02:10:18,260 --> 02:10:18,480
Okay.

4332
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:18,900
Alright.

4333
02:10:19,180 --> 02:10:20,700
I'll do it on one, okay?

4334
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:21,480
Okay.

4335
02:10:22,740 --> 02:10:24,100
Oh, you just have to move a little bit.

4336
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:24,500
Okay.

4337
02:10:24,760 --> 02:10:25,100
Yeah, yeah.

4338
02:10:25,140 --> 02:10:25,360
Okay.

4339
02:10:25,680 --> 02:10:27,880
Three, two, one.

4340
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:37,400
We're just... none of us.

4341
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:38,260
Howard, none of us.

4342
02:10:41,860 --> 02:10:42,820
We're trying.

4343
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:47,260
Alright, switch to dance.

4344
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:47,680
Eight.

4345
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:48,440
One.

4346
02:10:48,620 --> 02:10:49,680
Three, two, one.

4347
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:52,280
Dancing!

4348
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:53,660
We're at sync!

4349
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:54,280
We're at sync!

4350
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:55,240
We're at sync!

4351
02:10:55,660 --> 02:10:59,160
Okay, um... maybe not me, though.

4352
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:02,300
No, it kind of works.

4353
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:03,080
It's like a delay.

4354
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:04,040
It's like, I'm first.

4355
02:11:04,300 --> 02:11:04,420
Yeah.

4356
02:11:04,420 --> 02:11:04,780
Yeah.

4357
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:05,480
Yeah.

4358
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:05,800
That's true.

4359
02:11:05,940 --> 02:11:06,360
That's true.

4360
02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:15,340
You guys saw how everybody calls this green and yellow woman, right?

4361
02:11:15,620 --> 02:11:15,740
Yeah.

4362
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:17,100
Yeah.

4363
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:17,420
Yeah.

4364
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:18,220
Oh, yeah.

4365
02:11:20,780 --> 02:11:21,820
Very creative.

4366
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:23,920
Very, very creative.

4367
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:25,680
This is good.

4368
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:26,480
This is good.

4369
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:28,960
GG's, guys.

4370
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:30,360
What a journey.

4371
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:34,820
I think this was a mission success for us.

4372
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:35,720
Yeah.

4373
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:36,400
Yeah.

4374
02:11:37,100 --> 02:11:37,820
I'm dead.

4375
02:11:37,820 --> 02:11:41,260
I love these stupid horror games, so I'm always down.

4376
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:41,860
Me too!

4377
02:11:42,980 --> 02:11:44,760
The Kuso game?

4378
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:49,160
I love it.

4379
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:49,820
Me too.

4380
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:52,860
Especially, like, voice proximity.

4381
02:11:52,860 --> 02:11:52,960
Ready?

4382
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:53,960
Yes!

4383
02:11:54,280 --> 02:11:54,540
Yeah!

4384
02:11:55,180 --> 02:11:56,040
Come on.

4385
02:11:57,180 --> 02:11:57,940
I love voice.

4386
02:11:57,940 --> 02:11:59,020
Okay, can we do flip?

4387
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:00,020
All right.

4388
02:12:00,360 --> 02:12:00,880
Do the countdown.

4389
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:03,900
One, three, two, one.

4390
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:14,780
We just did it!

4391
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:15,740
Wait, what is F?

4392
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:16,940
What?

4393
02:12:17,180 --> 02:12:17,920
What's F?

4394
02:12:18,460 --> 02:12:19,020
Oh, salute.

4395
02:12:19,660 --> 02:12:19,980
Oh!

4396
02:12:19,980 --> 02:12:21,220
It's whenever someone dies.

4397
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:22,600
Oh, we should have done that!

4398
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:25,120
I don't even see it!

4399
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:25,920
Me too!

4400
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:30,140
Every time someone dies, we could have all been around their body and...

4401
02:12:30,140 --> 02:12:31,560
That flip was awesome!

4402
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:32,520
That was a...

4403
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:33,020
It was!

4404
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:34,820
That was a pretty cool flip.

4405
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:36,960
Someone should make a montage of just that flip.

4406
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:38,440
With different perspectives.

4407
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:39,460
You know?

4408
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:43,820
GG's, guys.

4409
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:45,960
I had a great time with all of you.

4410
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:47,460
With my green and yellow women.

4411
02:12:48,100 --> 02:12:48,180
Yeah!

4412
02:12:48,860 --> 02:12:49,340
GG's!

4413
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:50,080
Until...

4414
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:52,940
Well, I hope we get to play something again in the future.

4415
02:12:53,480 --> 02:12:53,500
Yeah!

4416
02:12:54,160 --> 02:12:54,660
Yeah!

4417
02:12:55,700 --> 02:12:57,280
Yeah, GG's, guys.

4418
02:12:57,720 --> 02:12:59,720
I guess we'll talk to our chat now.

4419
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:00,860
Okay!

4420
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:02,720
All right, bye-bye, guys!

4421
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,900
Thanks for joining me on this channel!

4422
02:13:05,740 --> 02:13:06,400
Bye-bye!

4423
02:13:06,680 --> 02:13:06,960
F.

4424
02:13:07,140 --> 02:13:07,920
It was an honor.

4425
02:13:08,220 --> 02:13:09,620
It was an honor, everyone.

4426
02:13:11,580 --> 02:13:12,140
F.

4427
02:13:12,540 --> 02:13:12,880
F.

4428
02:13:13,780 --> 02:13:14,340
Hi!

4429
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:16,120
Bye-bye!

4430
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:19,740
If I leave, the entire server closes.

4431
02:13:19,980 --> 02:13:20,440
So I'll do that.

4432
02:13:20,640 --> 02:13:22,120
Wait, I want to see if I can die by this thing.

4433
02:13:22,380 --> 02:13:22,840
Oh, okay.

4434
02:13:23,060 --> 02:13:24,020
I guess we could F her.

4435
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:27,980
Help me!

4436
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:28,920
Oh, okay, okay.

4437
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:31,360
Okay, she's dead.

4438
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:32,400
Give an F for her.

4439
02:13:33,220 --> 02:13:33,580
Goodbye.

4440
02:13:44,730 --> 02:13:45,290
Oh, wait.

4441
02:13:45,350 --> 02:13:46,090
That was fun!

4442
02:13:46,090 --> 02:13:51,990
I had a great time with, uh, Mint, uh, Doobie, and Nimi.

4443
02:13:52,350 --> 02:13:54,630
All right, let me swap over to...

4444
02:13:54,630 --> 02:13:55,130
It's summer, right?

4445
02:13:55,190 --> 02:13:55,910
Yeah, summertime.

4446
02:13:56,950 --> 02:13:57,830
I got it.

4447
02:13:58,170 --> 02:13:58,810
Oh, I can...

4448
02:13:58,810 --> 02:13:59,110
Let me...

4449
02:13:59,110 --> 02:14:00,130
Okay, we flew back...

4450
02:14:00,130 --> 02:14:01,270
Back on Earth now.

4451
02:14:07,070 --> 02:14:11,830
I had a great time with the three girls.

4452
02:14:12,270 --> 02:14:13,110
It was fun.

4453
02:14:13,330 --> 02:14:14,050
I had a fun time.

4454
02:14:14,630 --> 02:14:19,410
But yeah, Doobie and I, we, like, researched a little bit before the stream.

4455
02:14:19,410 --> 02:14:23,110
Um, just cause, like, we wanted to make sure we can complete it today.

4456
02:14:23,530 --> 02:14:25,090
Uh, but we didn't spoil ourselves.

4457
02:14:25,230 --> 02:14:26,690
We just wanted to know, like, where to...

4458
02:14:26,690 --> 02:14:27,330
What to do next.

4459
02:14:27,330 --> 02:14:29,550
Just cause we were so trapped in that one area.

4460
02:14:29,890 --> 02:14:32,030
So, like, it was just for, like, the yellow...

4461
02:14:32,030 --> 02:14:34,450
Like, cause, like, I was so confused about the yellow car.

4462
02:14:34,710 --> 02:14:36,930
And then she was confused about that other area.

4463
02:14:37,150 --> 02:14:37,650
I know.

4464
02:14:37,830 --> 02:14:38,950
We're heroes, guys.

4465
02:14:40,810 --> 02:14:43,030
We've landed back on planet Earth.

4466
02:14:43,310 --> 02:14:43,850
We're heroes.

4467
02:14:45,690 --> 02:14:46,130
Uh...

4468
02:14:46,130 --> 02:14:47,310
Where's our parade?

4469
02:14:49,650 --> 02:14:50,090
Um...

4470
02:14:50,090 --> 02:14:53,470
But, like, after that, we didn't, like, really know what to do after that.

4471
02:14:53,610 --> 02:14:57,330
But I'm glad we were able to complete the game.

4472
02:14:57,650 --> 02:14:58,010
You know?

4473
02:14:58,590 --> 02:14:59,850
Um, complete the game today.

4474
02:15:00,010 --> 02:15:01,410
Cause, you know, it was, uh...

4475
02:15:01,410 --> 02:15:02,550
It was a lot of...

4476
02:15:02,550 --> 02:15:03,270
It was a...

4477
02:15:03,270 --> 02:15:03,610
You know?

4478
02:15:04,210 --> 02:15:05,870
There were some tasks there.

4479
02:15:05,870 --> 02:15:06,870
That was...

4480
02:15:07,650 --> 02:15:09,130
Super complicated and everything.

4481
02:15:10,030 --> 02:15:10,410
Um...

4482
02:15:10,410 --> 02:15:10,750
And...

4483
02:15:11,470 --> 02:15:13,310
And we had to split up, gang.

4484
02:15:13,750 --> 02:15:13,970
Yeah.

4485
02:15:15,350 --> 02:15:15,830
Um...

4486
02:15:15,830 --> 02:15:16,470
But it was really fun.

4487
02:15:16,470 --> 02:15:17,450
I had a great time.

4488
02:15:17,790 --> 02:15:18,270
Uh...

4489
02:15:18,270 --> 02:15:19,470
I had a great time with all of them.

4490
02:15:19,530 --> 02:15:21,110
And I'm happy that we did this...

4491
02:15:21,110 --> 02:15:21,570
We...

4492
02:15:21,570 --> 02:15:22,470
We did a collab together.

4493
02:15:24,510 --> 02:15:24,990
Uh...

4494
02:15:26,650 --> 02:15:27,130
Uh...

4495
02:15:27,130 --> 02:15:29,110
Okay, collab is over.

4496
02:15:29,270 --> 02:15:31,250
Put my Fugi back on.

4497
02:15:33,370 --> 02:15:33,850
Uh...

4498
02:15:36,130 --> 02:15:38,090
Seijin, thank you for the Magenta Supa.

4499
02:15:38,270 --> 02:15:39,010
Thank you, thank you.

4500
02:15:39,110 --> 02:15:42,230
I have to convince our lack of map knowledge actually became the good part.

4501
02:15:42,350 --> 02:15:44,790
Since this brought us on amazing adventure.

4502
02:15:44,970 --> 02:15:46,270
Thank you for the Magenta Supa.

4503
02:15:46,390 --> 02:15:47,150
Thank you, thank you.

4504
02:15:47,250 --> 02:15:48,210
Yeah, like...

4505
02:15:48,210 --> 02:15:48,990
That was...

4506
02:15:49,650 --> 02:15:54,770
The fact that none of us realized that we could have used the map this entire time.

4507
02:15:55,290 --> 02:15:56,950
I can't believe it.

4508
02:15:56,950 --> 02:15:58,270
I can't believe we...

4509
02:15:58,270 --> 02:16:02,330
We actually made it so much harder for ourselves.

4510
02:16:04,150 --> 02:16:04,550
Um...

4511
02:16:05,210 --> 02:16:05,610
Uh...

4512
02:16:05,610 --> 02:16:06,790
No, thank you for the super chat.

4513
02:16:06,870 --> 02:16:07,110
Thank you.

4514
02:16:07,250 --> 02:16:07,770
Thank you.

4515
02:16:07,950 --> 02:16:11,330
How Nimi's stats affect the viability of...

4516
02:16:12,250 --> 02:16:13,650
of green and yellow.

4517
02:16:13,950 --> 02:16:15,550
We're still green and yellow.

4518
02:16:15,550 --> 02:16:16,770
And we're still women.

4519
02:16:20,550 --> 02:16:20,950
Um...

4520
02:16:20,950 --> 02:16:21,730
Thank you for the super chat.

4521
02:16:21,810 --> 02:16:21,990
Thank you.

4522
02:16:23,010 --> 02:16:24,270
Pyro, thank you for the super chat.

4523
02:16:24,350 --> 02:16:25,050
Thank you.

4524
02:16:25,230 --> 02:16:25,930
Hi, Doki.

4525
02:16:26,010 --> 02:16:27,150
I turned 22 yesterday.

4526
02:16:27,310 --> 02:16:28,090
Can I get a happy birthday?

4527
02:16:28,150 --> 02:16:29,110
Of course you can.

4528
02:16:29,490 --> 02:16:31,230
Happy birthday to you.

4529
02:16:31,230 --> 02:16:33,450
Happy birthday to you.

4530
02:16:33,630 --> 02:16:35,950
Happy birthday, dear Pyro.

4531
02:16:36,350 --> 02:16:38,270
Happy birthday to you.

4532
02:16:38,510 --> 02:16:39,090
Nyaaaah!

4533
02:16:39,290 --> 02:16:39,870
Happy birthday!

4534
02:16:41,870 --> 02:16:44,910
Alright, let me look at the super chat reading.

4535
02:16:45,590 --> 02:16:51,550
Oh yeah, for those who are wondering, for dad update, he is just resting right now.

4536
02:16:51,950 --> 02:16:56,790
He's on a strict two weeks, four week rest at the moment.

4537
02:16:57,890 --> 02:17:01,710
So, I just wish him good luck on his recovery.

4538
02:17:04,130 --> 02:17:05,570
Alright, where was I?

4539
02:17:06,150 --> 02:17:07,130
On my super chat.

4540
02:17:11,390 --> 02:17:19,470
Lacon, Mehdi, Nepers, Morph Balls, Byte, Alan, Matt, Chi, Ryu, Forward.

4541
02:17:19,670 --> 02:17:21,310
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

4542
02:17:21,370 --> 02:17:23,650
Alan, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

4543
02:17:23,650 --> 02:17:27,190
Ah, Seijen, thank you for the super stickers, thank you, thank you.

4544
02:17:27,790 --> 02:17:29,890
Kenshin, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

4545
02:17:30,030 --> 02:17:31,770
I will follow Doki into death.

4546
02:17:31,970 --> 02:17:36,650
If Doki were an anvil, call me crazy, but I'll be fine with her falling on me.

4547
02:17:43,170 --> 02:17:44,490
What else is there?

4548
02:17:45,210 --> 02:17:48,130
Uh, Alan, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

4549
02:17:48,250 --> 02:17:49,370
Yes, Doki, keep going.

4550
02:17:49,510 --> 02:17:50,970
You're gonna finish the g- ah.

4551
02:17:51,250 --> 02:18:09,010
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha I got to be in your stream live,

4552
02:18:09,190 --> 02:18:09,410
finally.

4553
02:18:09,530 --> 02:18:10,270
Thank you, the super chat.

4554
02:18:10,370 --> 02:18:10,910
Thank you.

4555
02:18:11,050 --> 02:18:20,050
I think my favorite part during that stream was when... was when Doobie was like, Hey, guys, you're going the wrong.

4556
02:18:20,250 --> 02:18:21,190
And then she died.

4557
02:18:21,390 --> 02:18:23,010
He's in front of me.

4558
02:18:24,350 --> 02:18:25,910
That was so good.

4559
02:18:26,270 --> 02:18:28,090
I was just like, Oh, my God.

4560
02:18:28,590 --> 02:18:29,890
They killed Doobie.

4561
02:18:32,590 --> 02:18:34,990
I was like, Oh, my God.

4562
02:18:35,650 --> 02:18:36,150
Doobie.

4563
02:18:39,550 --> 02:18:41,870
Like, he came out of nowhere.

4564
02:18:42,850 --> 02:18:44,410
I thought of us.

4565
02:18:44,690 --> 02:18:47,750
I was like, Oh, where was he?

4566
02:18:50,050 --> 02:18:52,770
He killed the kid, the team.

4567
02:18:53,290 --> 02:18:55,190
Like, you bastards.

4568
02:18:56,530 --> 02:18:58,490
It was just like, every time.

4569
02:18:58,730 --> 02:19:01,010
I swear, like, it always happens to her, too.

4570
02:19:01,390 --> 02:19:09,170
Because, like, that happened to her, like, um, I think, like, like, at least four times within the two parts that we played.

4571
02:19:09,350 --> 02:19:15,790
It was crazy that, uh, that that happened so many times.

4572
02:19:16,310 --> 02:19:19,050
Um, let's see.

4573
02:19:19,390 --> 02:19:22,110
Uh, best part of the stream was boobs.

4574
02:19:23,150 --> 02:19:24,750
Thank you for the super chat.

4575
02:19:24,890 --> 02:19:25,170
Thank you.

4576
02:19:25,330 --> 02:19:25,870
Thank you.

4577
02:19:25,870 --> 02:19:33,010
Guys, literally, the fact that only two people was typing the right number, but it was so hard to...

4578
02:19:33,010 --> 02:19:35,430
Because it was such a fucking long password.

4579
02:19:35,730 --> 02:19:39,050
So, like, every time I could see it, I only saw the first three digits.

4580
02:19:39,230 --> 02:19:43,230
And then the boobs fan, like, like, bumped it off of my chat.

4581
02:19:43,390 --> 02:19:48,610
So, I couldn't... I had to, like, wait until the guy reposted the password.

4582
02:19:52,070 --> 02:19:54,270
That was the point of boobs.

4583
02:19:54,530 --> 02:19:57,690
I was like, guys, please, I can't fucking see.

4584
02:19:57,990 --> 02:19:59,770
It can't be boobs.

4585
02:20:00,430 --> 02:20:02,490
Um, I couldn't stop.

4586
02:20:02,650 --> 02:20:03,390
Yeah, I forgot.

4587
02:20:03,610 --> 02:20:03,970
I know.

4588
02:20:04,070 --> 02:20:07,210
I was like, why didn't I just tab out and stop the squirrel?

4589
02:20:07,410 --> 02:20:08,870
I was just so locked in.

4590
02:20:08,990 --> 02:20:10,450
I was so fucking locked in.

4591
02:20:10,470 --> 02:20:11,050
You don't understand.

4592
02:20:12,510 --> 02:20:13,630
Oh, thank you, super chat.

4593
02:20:13,750 --> 02:20:13,970
Thank you.

4594
02:20:13,970 --> 02:20:14,490
Thank you.

4595
02:20:14,690 --> 02:20:16,390
I just came back from shopping and stuff.

4596
02:20:16,470 --> 02:20:18,590
Did you guys have a grand gay time?

4597
02:20:20,370 --> 02:20:21,830
Audio, thank you for the super chat.

4598
02:20:21,930 --> 02:20:22,150
Thank you.

4599
02:20:22,250 --> 02:20:22,650
Thank you.

4600
02:20:22,930 --> 02:20:25,570
Every moment felt like the phrase, what could go wrong?

4601
02:20:25,850 --> 02:20:27,350
Surely it can't get worse, right?

4602
02:20:31,790 --> 02:20:32,910
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

4603
02:20:32,990 --> 02:20:33,190
Thank you.

4604
02:20:33,270 --> 02:20:33,610
Thank you.

4605
02:20:33,710 --> 02:20:34,570
Yellow women.

4606
02:20:34,990 --> 02:20:35,190
Why?

4607
02:20:36,830 --> 02:20:37,930
Yeah, thank you, guys.

4608
02:20:38,110 --> 02:20:40,870
I had a fun time with Nini Doobie and Mint.

4609
02:20:41,070 --> 02:20:43,290
I hope they had a fun time with me, too.

4610
02:20:44,310 --> 02:20:47,090
I hope they all had a good time with this game.

4611
02:20:48,190 --> 02:20:51,830
It's always nice to play, like, you know, these, like...

4612
02:20:51,830 --> 02:20:53,110
I guess, are they friend slop?

4613
02:20:53,410 --> 02:20:59,570
I feel like everything... every, like, collab game is now categorized as friend slop.

4614
02:20:59,790 --> 02:21:03,810
Like, what makes it a friend slop and what doesn't make it a friend slop?

4615
02:21:04,130 --> 02:21:05,930
Like, even, like, good games.

4616
02:21:06,190 --> 02:21:08,610
Like, good collab games, people call it a friend slop.

4617
02:21:09,030 --> 02:21:09,470
Like...

4618
02:21:12,410 --> 02:21:13,730
Yeah, I'm just like...

4619
02:21:13,730 --> 02:21:16,110
What doesn't make it a friend slop these days?

4620
02:21:16,190 --> 02:21:16,950
Like, I'm so confused.

4621
02:21:19,150 --> 02:21:22,750
I feel like people are overusing that word now.

4622
02:21:23,610 --> 02:21:25,010
Yeah, it lost its meaning.

4623
02:21:26,470 --> 02:21:27,830
Smug, thank you for the super chat.

4624
02:21:27,950 --> 02:21:28,670
Thank you, thank you.

4625
02:21:28,830 --> 02:21:30,550
I always wished for a collab between Nini and you.

4626
02:21:30,690 --> 02:21:31,990
So the streams made me so happy.

4627
02:21:32,170 --> 02:21:34,230
Can't wait for another friend slop game with this group.

4628
02:21:34,330 --> 02:21:35,090
Thank you for the super chat.

4629
02:21:35,230 --> 02:21:35,750
Thank you, thank you.

4630
02:21:35,930 --> 02:21:37,850
It's been fun doing collabs again.

4631
02:21:38,090 --> 02:21:39,690
I know, like, we have been on a...

4632
02:21:39,690 --> 02:21:44,990
We haven't really done much collabs and branching out of the group for a while.

4633
02:21:44,990 --> 02:21:48,550
Um, I think, like, for a few months, uh, a few months ago.

4634
02:21:49,030 --> 02:21:50,510
Uh, but yeah, I'm slowly...

4635
02:21:50,510 --> 02:21:54,370
My streak of collabing with people and meeting new people has continued.

4636
02:21:54,890 --> 02:21:57,730
Um, uh, next week...

4637
02:21:57,730 --> 02:22:00,710
What is my schedule like for next week, actually?

4638
02:22:00,710 --> 02:22:01,690
I actually don't know.

4639
02:22:03,090 --> 02:22:03,570
Um...

4640
02:22:06,050 --> 02:22:10,390
Oh, I haven't put anything down...

4641
02:22:10,390 --> 02:22:11,810
Oh, wait, uh...

4642
02:22:11,810 --> 02:22:14,610
Next week, uh...

4643
02:22:15,190 --> 02:22:17,770
We have, uh...

4644
02:22:17,770 --> 02:22:18,710
It's August...

4645
02:22:18,710 --> 02:22:19,830
Okay, it's August 1.

4646
02:22:19,930 --> 02:22:22,370
Okay, so next week, we're...

4647
02:22:22,370 --> 02:22:23,950
We got...

4648
02:22:24,510 --> 02:22:27,650
There's, like, I think, like, two sponsors next week.

4649
02:22:27,870 --> 02:22:29,410
Yeah, there's two sponsors next week.

4650
02:22:29,410 --> 02:22:32,990
For those who don't know, we have a Vita Ramen sponsor.

4651
02:22:33,350 --> 02:22:35,330
Um, uh, we're...

4652
02:22:35,330 --> 02:22:35,830
We're...

4653
02:22:35,830 --> 02:22:40,290
We're releasing a bunch of videos to celebrate the sponsor.

4654
02:22:40,450 --> 02:22:44,370
For those who don't know what Vita Ramen is, usually they do a lot of knife collabs.

4655
02:22:45,470 --> 02:22:48,130
I can't really spoil exactly what the products are.

4656
02:22:48,330 --> 02:22:53,470
But, you know, they've done quite a couple of knives, uh, for other VTubers.

4657
02:22:54,650 --> 02:22:56,270
And there's other stuff, too.

4658
02:22:56,990 --> 02:22:57,550
Hmm...

4659
02:22:57,550 --> 02:22:57,810
Hmm...

4660
02:22:57,810 --> 02:23:00,370
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...

4661
02:23:00,370 --> 02:23:03,110
There may or may not be other stuff, too.

4662
02:23:04,450 --> 02:23:05,010
Hmm...

4663
02:23:05,010 --> 02:23:06,690
Ha ha ha ha ha...

4664
02:23:06,690 --> 02:23:08,090
Ha ha ha ha ha...

4665
02:23:09,230 --> 02:23:09,790
So...

4666
02:23:09,790 --> 02:23:10,190
Um...

4667
02:23:10,810 --> 02:23:11,690
There's that.

4668
02:23:11,930 --> 02:23:15,270
And then we also have another sponsor that I can't name yet.

4669
02:23:15,270 --> 02:23:18,090
Because I haven't signed the contract yet.

4670
02:23:18,390 --> 02:23:19,380
So, um...

4671
02:23:20,030 --> 02:23:20,310
Um...

4672
02:23:20,310 --> 02:23:24,210
That will be, uh, announced soon-ish.

4673
02:23:24,210 --> 02:23:27,730
It's basically, uh...

4674
02:23:27,730 --> 02:23:30,150
We've done the sponsor before, too, so...

4675
02:23:31,190 --> 02:23:31,550
Hmm...

4676
02:23:31,550 --> 02:23:33,570
Ha ha ha ha ha...

4677
02:23:33,570 --> 02:23:34,410
Ha ha ha ha...

4678
02:23:34,410 --> 02:23:35,990
Ha ha ha ha...

4679
02:23:35,990 --> 02:23:36,870
Um...

4680
02:23:36,870 --> 02:23:38,410
That's all I can say.

4681
02:23:39,190 --> 02:23:39,990
Ha ha ha ha...

4682
02:23:40,850 --> 02:23:41,410
Uh...

4683
02:23:41,410 --> 02:23:43,250
Oh, I think we have three sponsors.

4684
02:23:43,470 --> 02:23:44,230
Actually, oh my god.

4685
02:23:44,410 --> 02:23:45,230
I have the next week.

4686
02:23:45,670 --> 02:23:46,050
Um...

4687
02:23:46,050 --> 02:23:46,430
Money!

4688
02:23:46,850 --> 02:23:47,470
Ha ha ha ha...

4689
02:23:47,470 --> 02:23:47,990
Okay, guys.

4690
02:23:48,110 --> 02:23:49,110
Okay, but like...

4691
02:23:49,110 --> 02:23:49,630
I hate...

4692
02:23:49,630 --> 02:23:50,350
Guys, I...

4693
02:23:50,350 --> 02:23:52,190
I need to rebuild my funding.

4694
02:23:52,190 --> 02:23:55,550
Ha ha ha ha...

4695
02:23:55,550 --> 02:23:56,130
Um...

4696
02:23:56,130 --> 02:23:57,050
I had a great time.

4697
02:23:57,810 --> 02:23:58,330
Um...

4698
02:23:58,790 --> 02:23:59,250
Yay!

4699
02:24:00,010 --> 02:24:01,250
So I can do more stuff.

4700
02:24:01,450 --> 02:24:02,330
So I can...

4701
02:24:02,330 --> 02:24:02,670
Uh...

4702
02:24:02,670 --> 02:24:04,350
Invest more in my channel!

4703
02:24:04,850 --> 02:24:05,470
Let's go!

4704
02:24:06,370 --> 02:24:07,430
Let's, uh, go!

4705
02:24:07,850 --> 02:24:08,490

4706

Yippee!

4707
02:24:13,310 --> 02:24:13,830
Um...

4708
02:24:15,970 --> 02:24:16,490
Um...

4709
02:24:16,490 --> 02:24:17,450
Did you guys see that?

4710
02:24:17,710 --> 02:24:18,290
Oh my gosh.

4711
02:24:18,350 --> 02:24:19,110
Did you guys see...

4712
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:19,390
Okay.

4713
02:24:19,690 --> 02:24:21,750
I want to talk to you guys a little bit more before I go.

4714
02:24:22,190 --> 02:24:23,070
Ha ha ha...

4715
02:24:23,070 --> 02:24:23,510
Uh...

4716
02:24:23,510 --> 02:24:26,910
So even though I finished all my Super Chats, I still want to hang out with you guys.

4717
02:24:27,290 --> 02:24:27,590
Uh...

4718
02:24:27,590 --> 02:24:27,890
But...

4719
02:24:27,890 --> 02:24:29,250
Did you guys see the...

4720
02:24:29,250 --> 02:24:30,710
The new Overwatch update?

4721
02:24:31,050 --> 02:24:32,270
But like only...

4722
02:24:32,270 --> 02:24:33,710
In the Chinese server.

4723
02:24:34,150 --> 02:24:34,950
Where they...

4724
02:24:34,950 --> 02:24:37,930
You know how like on Valentine's Day, they released a...

4725
02:24:37,930 --> 02:24:38,710
Uh...

4726
02:24:38,710 --> 02:24:40,390
They released a...

4727
02:24:40,390 --> 02:24:41,090
Visual novel.

4728
02:24:41,750 --> 02:24:42,190
Um...

4729
02:24:42,190 --> 02:24:42,970
They did that again.

4730
02:24:42,970 --> 02:24:45,730
But it's only exclusive to the Chinese servers.

4731
02:24:46,010 --> 02:24:47,650
And you can actually like...

4732
02:24:47,650 --> 02:24:50,930
You're like actually going on a date with the Overwatch characters.

4733

4734
02:24:51,990 --> 02:24:52,710

4742
02:25:00,030 --> 02:25:00,670

With the other like...

4744
02:25:01,990 --> 02:25:03,190
Overwatch characters and stuff.

Yeah, you can...

4746
02:25:04,310 --> 02:25:05,990
You can actually date them.

4747
02:25:06,250 --> 02:25:06,450
Yeah.

4748
02:25:07,050 --> 02:25:07,190
Ha ha ha ha...

4749
02:25:07,190 --> 02:25:08,110
It was a visual...

4750
02:25:08,110 --> 02:25:09,490
Yeah, it is...

4751
02:25:09,490 --> 02:25:10,310
It was crazy.

4752
02:25:10,470 --> 02:25:11,670
And it has like unique...

4753
02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:13,510
There's like unique skins.

4754
02:25:14,690 --> 02:25:15,210
And...

4755
02:25:15,210 --> 02:25:15,750
Cause like...

4756
02:25:15,750 --> 02:25:17,270
You remember the Valentine's Day one?

4757
02:25:17,270 --> 02:25:18,090
It was like...

4758
02:25:18,090 --> 02:25:20,650
It was an April Fool's type thing.

4759
02:25:21,230 --> 02:25:21,670
Um...

4760
02:25:21,670 --> 02:25:23,810
But for this one, they actually went all out.

4761
02:25:25,030 --> 02:25:25,470
Um...

4762
02:25:25,470 --> 02:25:27,550
But I think like there was a trailer and everything.

4763
02:25:28,990 --> 02:25:29,430
Uh...

4764
02:25:29,430 --> 02:25:30,090
So...

4765
02:25:30,090 --> 02:25:30,550
Wait, I'll show...

4766
02:25:30,550 --> 02:25:31,390
I'll link it to you guys.

4767
02:25:31,550 --> 02:25:32,750
I like bookmarked it.

4768
02:25:33,010 --> 02:25:34,250
But you can date MAGA.

4769
02:25:34,850 --> 02:25:36,150
Ha ha ha ha...

4770
02:25:37,930 --> 02:25:39,430
I was like, oh my god.

4771
02:25:39,990 --> 02:25:40,430
Like...

4772
02:25:40,430 --> 02:25:40,690
What?

4773
02:25:42,530 --> 02:25:44,250
I can't believe it's like only in...

4774
02:25:44,250 --> 02:25:46,270
In China servers too.

4775
02:25:46,890 --> 02:25:47,730
I thought they would like...

4776
02:25:47,730 --> 02:25:48,970
Release it to...

4777
02:25:48,970 --> 02:25:49,250
Worldwide.

4778
02:25:50,890 --> 02:25:51,290
Um...

4779
02:25:51,290 --> 02:25:52,130
And everything.

4780
02:25:52,410 --> 02:25:53,670
So I thought it was super interesting.

4781
02:25:55,990 --> 02:25:56,390
Uh...

4782
02:25:56,390 --> 02:25:57,370
I saw like a video...

4783
02:25:57,370 --> 02:25:59,110
A video trailer of it, but...

4784
02:26:00,970 --> 02:26:01,370
Um...

4785
02:26:02,110 --> 02:26:04,550
I saw a video trailer of it, but I didn't like...

4786
02:26:04,970 --> 02:26:05,510
Bookmarked it.

4787
02:26:05,810 --> 02:26:06,150
Uh...

4788
02:26:06,150 --> 02:26:06,350
Pun!

4789
02:26:06,550 --> 02:26:07,250
Thank you to the super chat.

4790
02:26:07,350 --> 02:26:07,550
Thank you.

4791
02:26:07,690 --> 02:26:08,070
Thank you.

4792
02:26:08,170 --> 02:26:08,730
Hi Doki!

4793
02:26:08,850 --> 02:26:09,390
It's my birthday!

4794
02:26:09,390 --> 02:26:11,110
So glad to celebrate the dragons!

4795
02:26:14,810 --> 02:26:16,570
Happy birthday to you.

4796
02:26:16,810 --> 02:26:20,850
Happy birthday dear Pun Gun!

4797
02:26:22,910 --> 02:26:23,370
Yeah!

4798
02:26:23,750 --> 02:26:24,290
Happy birthday!

4799
02:26:25,030 --> 02:26:26,370
Brittany, thank you for the super chat.

4800
02:26:26,530 --> 02:26:26,790
Thank you.

4801
02:26:26,970 --> 02:26:27,170
Thank.

4802
02:26:27,570 --> 02:26:27,910
Yeah.

4803
02:26:29,070 --> 02:26:29,530
Um...

4804
02:26:29,530 --> 02:26:30,670
What else did I want to talk about?

4805
02:26:31,950 --> 02:26:32,610
Oh, yes.

4806
02:26:32,730 --> 02:26:34,090
I'll announce what tomorrow's stream is.

4807
02:26:34,210 --> 02:26:35,230
Okay, so there's two announcements.

4808
02:26:35,510 --> 02:26:35,850
Um...

4809
02:26:35,850 --> 02:26:38,070
But I'll do the first announcement right now.

4810
02:26:38,470 --> 02:26:38,930
Because...

4811
02:26:38,930 --> 02:26:43,250
Um, you guys might... I'll be uploading the waiting room anyway later tonight.

4812
02:26:43,590 --> 02:26:47,350
Or in the morning, depends on when I'm getting my thumbnail sent over.

4813
02:26:47,950 --> 02:26:55,030
Um, but, um, for tomorrow, um, we are the special stream for tomorrow.

4814
02:26:55,490 --> 02:26:56,750
It is a public stream.

4815
02:26:57,050 --> 02:27:05,210
So, the thing about it is that we're finally relaunching the Doki SMP Minecraft server for the Dragoons.

4816
02:27:05,210 --> 02:27:15,450
So, members, right now, members, if you check your, um, community post, um, if you check the community post right now, um, there is details on how to join the server.

4817
02:27:15,770 --> 02:27:23,050
So, um, the thing about the server is that, uh, I have to stream once a month on it, um, every month.

4818
02:27:23,250 --> 02:27:24,530
At least one time every month.

4819
02:27:25,110 --> 02:27:28,910
And, um, and it will have, it has to be, it will be a public stream.

4820
02:27:29,150 --> 02:27:32,030
So, every time I play on the server, it will be a public stream.

4821
02:27:32,030 --> 02:27:38,610
So, we fixed a lot of issues that was going on with 1.0 Doki SMP.

4822
02:27:38,950 --> 02:27:43,830
And the reason why it took so long to relaunch it is that we had to do a full overhaul on a lot of the stuff.

4823
02:27:44,010 --> 02:27:49,230
And re-update the plugins and everything for it for the newest Minecraft update.

4824
02:27:49,670 --> 02:27:55,910
So, if you're having issues connecting your Discord to YouTube...

4825
02:27:57,950 --> 02:28:02,930
My suggestion is to re-link your account and make sure it's the correct YouTube account.

4826
02:28:03,110 --> 02:28:05,270
So, just re-link it or log out and log back in.

4827
02:28:05,350 --> 02:28:10,210
Apparently, it's like a common problem if you need to re-link it and stuff.

4828
02:28:10,470 --> 02:28:12,250
You still need to... Technically, yes.

4829
02:28:12,450 --> 02:28:13,810
I still need to do Marvel Rival...

4830
02:28:13,810 --> 02:28:19,330
I haven't done the Marvel Rival stream quota the last two months because I've been very, very busy.

4831
02:28:20,430 --> 02:28:23,510
I was like apologizing because devs are really nice to me.

4832
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:25,850
Um, the devs actually were like...

4833
02:28:25,850 --> 02:28:29,970
They actually like contacted me asking me if like...

4834
02:28:29,970 --> 02:28:31,330
Um, they were like...

4835
02:28:31,330 --> 02:28:31,990
Do you wanna...

4836
02:28:31,990 --> 02:28:33,270
Do you wanna go to LAN?

4837
02:28:33,630 --> 02:28:34,850
Like, that's in China?

4838
02:28:35,150 --> 02:28:36,290
That's in two weeks?

4839
02:28:36,550 --> 02:28:37,310
Like, they would...

4840
02:28:37,310 --> 02:28:40,790
They wanted to pay for like my flight and uh...

4841
02:28:40,790 --> 02:28:41,990
My hotels and everything.

4842
02:28:42,250 --> 02:28:43,710
And I was so sweet of them.

4843
02:28:43,790 --> 02:28:44,510
I was like...

4844
02:28:44,510 --> 02:28:45,150
Oh my god.

4845
02:28:45,470 --> 02:28:46,010
What?

4846
02:28:46,570 --> 02:28:47,130
Hahaha.

4847
02:28:51,110 --> 02:28:51,510
Yeah.

4848
02:28:51,710 --> 02:28:52,810
But like...

4849
02:28:52,810 --> 02:28:53,550
Um...

4850
02:28:53,550 --> 02:28:54,590
Sadly...

4851
02:28:55,470 --> 02:28:58,550
I couldn't really do the things they wanted me to do.

4852
02:29:00,170 --> 02:29:00,690
Uh...

4853
02:29:01,510 --> 02:29:02,030
Uh...

4854
02:29:02,030 --> 02:29:02,190
Um...

4855
02:29:02,190 --> 02:29:02,450
There...

4856
02:29:02,450 --> 02:29:02,610
Yeah.

4857
02:29:02,730 --> 02:29:03,330
I was like...

4858
02:29:03,330 --> 02:29:05,050
You know, they wanted to...

4859
02:29:06,150 --> 02:29:07,650
Invite me to the LAN.

4860
02:29:07,930 --> 02:29:08,250
That like...

4861
02:29:08,250 --> 02:29:09,130
The Marvel Rivals.

4862
02:29:09,250 --> 02:29:10,510
The first Marvel Rivals LAN.

4863
02:29:10,750 --> 02:29:11,510
And everything.

4864
02:29:11,850 --> 02:29:12,650
But like...

4865
02:29:12,650 --> 02:29:13,170
They...

4866
02:29:13,170 --> 02:29:13,890
They want...

4867
02:29:13,890 --> 02:29:15,150
Cause um...

4868
02:29:15,150 --> 02:29:16,330
They wanted to like...

4869
02:29:16,330 --> 02:29:17,490
Do some events and stuff.

4870
02:29:17,970 --> 02:29:18,370
Um...

4871
02:29:18,370 --> 02:29:18,990
But then I was like...

4872
02:29:18,990 --> 02:29:19,350
Oh, I...

4873
02:29:19,350 --> 02:29:20,070
I'm a VTuber.

4874
02:29:20,470 --> 02:29:20,870
Haha.

4875
02:29:21,230 --> 02:29:21,510
You know?

4876
02:29:21,570 --> 02:29:22,190
I was like...

4877
02:29:22,190 --> 02:29:24,230
Oh, I can't really do all those things.

4878
02:29:24,310 --> 02:29:25,110
But then I...

4879
02:29:25,110 --> 02:29:25,890
Gave them like...

4880
02:29:25,890 --> 02:29:26,510
Suggestions.

4881
02:29:26,730 --> 02:29:27,230
And stuff.

4882
02:29:27,430 --> 02:29:28,070
And I was like...

4883
02:29:28,070 --> 02:29:28,870
Oh...

4884
02:29:29,270 --> 02:29:29,670
Um...

4885
02:29:29,670 --> 02:29:30,270
You know, like...

4886
02:29:30,270 --> 02:29:31,010
In Japan.

4887
02:29:31,070 --> 02:29:31,890
They've done like...

4888
02:29:31,890 --> 02:29:32,930
VTuber LAN events.

4889
02:29:33,090 --> 02:29:34,710
Where they put like a cardboard...

4890
02:29:34,710 --> 02:29:35,450
Like a...

4891
02:29:35,890 --> 02:29:36,690
Cardboard cutout.

4892
02:29:36,810 --> 02:29:38,070
Or they use like screens and stuff.

4893
02:29:38,130 --> 02:29:38,770
Pretending they're there.

4894
02:29:38,850 --> 02:29:39,650
And then the...

4895
02:29:39,650 --> 02:29:39,930
Uh...

4896
02:29:39,930 --> 02:29:41,190
The VTuber would like...

4897
02:29:41,190 --> 02:29:42,630
Play behind the scenes and stuff.

4898
02:29:42,790 --> 02:29:43,570
So they're like...

4899
02:29:43,570 --> 02:29:43,890
They're like...

4900
02:29:43,890 --> 02:29:45,110
Oh, we'll look into that.

4901
02:29:45,230 --> 02:29:46,270
We really want you to...

4902
02:29:46,270 --> 02:29:47,810
We really want you to participate.

4903
02:29:48,690 --> 02:29:49,050
Um...

4904
02:29:49,050 --> 02:29:49,210
You know?

4905
02:29:49,310 --> 02:29:49,590
We're like...

4906
02:29:49,590 --> 02:29:51,830
We really want you to participate in the future LANs and stuff.

4907
02:29:52,430 --> 02:29:52,790
So...

4908
02:29:53,530 --> 02:29:53,890
Um...

4909
02:29:53,890 --> 02:29:55,810
I sent them links to the videos of that too.

4910
02:29:55,970 --> 02:29:57,010
Like the videos of...

4911
02:29:57,530 --> 02:29:57,890
Um...

4912
02:29:57,890 --> 02:29:59,190
Like the Valorant LAN...

4913
02:29:59,190 --> 02:30:00,290
The Valorant LAN thing.

4914
02:30:00,430 --> 02:30:00,810
Where like...

4915
02:30:00,810 --> 02:30:01,910
They put a cardboard cutout.

4916
02:30:02,710 --> 02:30:03,070
Of...

4917
02:30:03,070 --> 02:30:03,770
Like people.

4918
02:30:04,030 --> 02:30:05,250
And like also the street fighters.

4919
02:30:05,550 --> 02:30:06,010
And stuff like that.

4920
02:30:06,050 --> 02:30:06,810
That they did in Japan.

4921
02:30:07,070 --> 02:30:09,910
And they said they're looking into that for the future LANs that they're doing.

4922
02:30:10,150 --> 02:30:11,410
And I thought that was so sweet.

4923
02:30:11,410 --> 02:30:14,330
You know, they're really nice to me and everything.

4924
02:30:16,230 --> 02:30:19,170
So yeah, I really appreciate that.

4925
02:30:20,730 --> 02:30:25,390
But I love working with my rival devs because they're really, really nice to me.

4926
02:30:25,650 --> 02:30:28,550
And Apex devs have also been super nice to me too.

4927
02:30:29,610 --> 02:30:31,770
Well, they've always been super nice to me.

4928
02:30:32,290 --> 02:30:36,410
And then you guys are like, Toki, why are you mentioning the Apex devs?

4929
02:30:36,530 --> 02:30:38,650
All of a sudden, it's been a while since you played Apex.

4930
02:30:49,850 --> 02:30:51,430
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

4931
02:30:51,570 --> 02:30:52,490
Thank you, thank you.

4932
02:30:52,670 --> 02:30:55,370
Just get Saikuno on stage, but you play Rainbow.

4933
02:30:55,750 --> 02:30:57,030
Thank you for the super chat.

4934
02:30:57,310 --> 02:30:58,670
Thank you, thank you.

4935
02:31:04,430 --> 02:31:06,810
But yeah, I really appreciate it.

4936
02:31:06,850 --> 02:31:08,950
Like I said in the last stream...

4937
02:31:10,570 --> 02:31:13,410
Anyways, the second last stream...

4938
02:31:13,410 --> 02:31:14,870
Oh wait, Melanie, thank you for the super chat.

4939
02:31:14,990 --> 02:31:15,570
Thank you, thank you.

4940
02:31:15,670 --> 02:31:18,370
They're fine with it because they know you're already hooked on Marvel Rivals.

4941
02:31:18,510 --> 02:31:19,230
You'll be back.

4942
02:31:19,370 --> 02:31:20,770
Thank you for the super chat.

4943
02:31:20,890 --> 02:31:21,850
Thank you, thank you.

4944
02:31:24,010 --> 02:31:28,130
But I really appreciate all these companies working with me and everything.

4945
02:31:28,330 --> 02:31:31,890
Like I said, when I came back, a lot of these companies...

4946
02:31:31,890 --> 02:31:36,830
Um, I know some of us were confused about like, oh, what does she mean by like, uh, professionally?

4947
02:31:36,970 --> 02:31:41,930
I meant like more so like, you know, the VTuber... in the VTuber community, it is like very...

4948
02:31:41,930 --> 02:31:47,390
Um, when I said like, oh, you know, like I was like a bit radioactive within the...

4949
02:31:47,390 --> 02:31:49,230
Professionally within the VTuber company.

4950
02:31:49,230 --> 02:32:00,750
So it was really nice, uh, um, that, uh, you know, all these companies like outside of the VTuber company wanted to work with me on all these things.

4951
02:32:00,750 --> 02:32:06,190
Because like, you know, you assume that you have to be corporate to like get these opportunities and stuff.

4952
02:32:06,190 --> 02:32:23,250
So it's, I felt really honored and like, you know, very lucky, um, that, you know, despite everything, um, you know, I was able to, um, get these opportunities and, um, be able to do all these things, uh, for you guys and with you guys.

4953
02:32:23,250 --> 02:32:29,970
And I really appreciate, uh, I really appreciate all my draggoons for supporting me throughout, um, the years too.

4954
02:32:30,550 --> 02:32:40,570
Um, and, um, and, um, um, it really does mean a lot because, you know, I couldn't do all of this without your support and your belief in me and everything.

4955
02:32:40,850 --> 02:32:41,690
Like, I'm very lucky.

4956
02:32:41,870 --> 02:32:47,510
I'm a very lucky, uh, very lucky for how it turned out in the end because it could have turned out very differently.

4957
02:32:47,590 --> 02:32:51,170
And I'm very lucky to have you guys as, uh, as my community.

4958
02:32:51,170 --> 02:32:55,850
And I'm very happy and I'm really happy for all the companies that believed in me.

4959
02:32:55,850 --> 02:33:02,210
And especially as an individual, you know, like taking a risk on an individual is, is, is like a lot too.

4960
02:33:02,730 --> 02:33:09,330
So, um, so, especially when, you know, um, I had to learn a lot.

4961
02:33:09,530 --> 02:33:14,010
Like I said, I messed up a lot, you know, like the Doki SMP 1.0.

4962
02:33:14,210 --> 02:33:17,510
I did not realize how much work that was at first.

4963
02:33:17,510 --> 02:33:28,370
Like, like, I, I did not realize how much work it was and like how much like it, it like time I had to like actually put on it.

4964
02:33:28,490 --> 02:33:34,710
Because we were like trying to whitelist people by hand and it was so, it was a very bad decision.

4965
02:33:34,710 --> 02:33:35,550
And I rushed it.

4966
02:33:35,630 --> 02:33:36,490
I did rush it.

4967
02:33:36,650 --> 02:33:38,950
I, cause I really wanted some fun things for you guys.

4968
02:33:39,050 --> 02:33:40,250
And I was like, I want to do so many things.

4969
02:33:40,250 --> 02:33:44,150
And I did, I messed up on that and I learned, I learned from my mistakes.

4970
02:33:44,150 --> 02:34:02,290
And that's why we, we took, when we like went to re redo everything, um, we took more time in, um, um, in trying to make sure that the server is, you know, the things I want to do and stuff is actually done before we launch it.

4971
02:34:02,290 --> 02:34:10,310
And like, you know, have stuff more automatic and everything and look into more like, look more, uh, what's it called quality of life changes and stuff like that.

4972
02:34:10,490 --> 02:34:21,230
So, uh, I'm glad that, um, I was able to, you know, learn from a lot of my mistakes and every day, every week, every day, I get better at my job.

4973
02:34:22,610 --> 02:34:24,890
If you think about it that way.

4974
02:34:27,450 --> 02:34:31,350
Every day we just, we get a little bit better at our job.

4975
02:34:33,570 --> 02:34:34,850
And I'm still learning.

4976
02:34:35,170 --> 02:34:47,250
I'm, I know it's like, I've been streaming for a while, but like, handling, I, I, when I took my career seriously, I was in a corporate, like area, like I was in a corporate environment.

4977
02:34:47,610 --> 02:34:52,230
And so like, that was so different from doing it in an indie environment.

4978
02:34:52,530 --> 02:34:58,250
And it made me realize just like, you know, a lot of things, all of like the checks and, what's it called?

4979
02:34:58,350 --> 02:35:02,150
The checks and balances and like making sure like everything is going the right way.

4980
02:35:02,150 --> 02:35:05,430
Um, and I had to do that on my own with my staff too.

4981
02:35:06,030 --> 02:35:14,950
But you know, maybe some of my staff is not, uh, uh, me and my staff, like have to figure that out together, um, and had a lot more responsibility.

4982
02:35:14,950 --> 02:35:18,070
And as the final check and everything too.

4983
02:35:18,190 --> 02:35:19,130
There's so much to learn.

4984
02:35:19,310 --> 02:35:19,430
Yeah.

4985
02:35:20,210 --> 02:35:23,470
Um, you know, I had to learn a lot of that from the ground up and everything.

4986
02:35:23,810 --> 02:35:26,630
So, uh, there's a lot of growth for me too.

4987
02:35:27,290 --> 02:35:30,750
Um, and I hope I, I grew a lot as a person.

4988
02:35:30,750 --> 02:35:33,310
Um, and I feel like I did.

4989
02:35:33,410 --> 02:35:36,530
I feel like I grew a lot as a person in terms of how to handle things.

4990
02:35:36,990 --> 02:35:38,690
Um, I mean, I'm still human.

4991
02:35:38,830 --> 02:35:40,450
So, I'm still human.

4992
02:35:40,450 --> 02:35:43,450
So, I still make mistakes and stuff.

4993
02:35:43,670 --> 02:35:44,590
Like, I do.

4994
02:35:45,030 --> 02:35:47,650
I, I am a very emotional person.

4995
02:35:48,090 --> 02:35:49,370
Um, in general.

4996
02:35:49,630 --> 02:35:51,510
But I've learned to like delegate things.

4997
02:35:51,530 --> 02:35:54,450
If I do get too emotional, I've learned to like delegate stuff.

4998
02:35:55,010 --> 02:36:00,150
And, um, and, you know, um, pass it on to others to work on things.

4999
02:36:00,230 --> 02:36:04,070
If I want to work on something else and focus my energy on something else, I delegate it to others.

5000
02:36:04,250 --> 02:36:05,650
Like this, the Doki SMP.

5001
02:36:06,110 --> 02:36:10,690
Um, I delegate it to a staff member, um, for it.

5002
02:36:10,830 --> 02:36:13,990
For it, um, for it when I realized, like, I can't handle this by myself.

5003
02:36:14,210 --> 02:36:20,710
And, um, um, and I'm really proud of how much they've worked on this.

5004
02:36:20,930 --> 02:36:23,410
And, uh, they worked on it.

5005
02:36:23,410 --> 02:36:25,370
And, you know, it looks really good.

5006
02:36:25,530 --> 02:36:30,350
And I can't wait to, I can't wait to, uh, to get on the server.

5007
02:36:30,630 --> 02:36:31,830
Uh, with all of you guys.

5008
02:36:32,130 --> 02:36:35,990
And, you know, re-experience the Doki SMP again.

5009
02:36:36,170 --> 02:36:36,530
Rebuild.

5010
02:36:36,810 --> 02:36:37,790
We will rebuild it.

5011
02:36:37,870 --> 02:36:39,590
It will be better than 1.0.

5012
02:36:39,810 --> 02:36:42,190
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

5013
02:36:42,850 --> 02:36:46,450
Uh, uh, Duck, thank you for the super chat.

5014
02:36:46,550 --> 02:36:46,750
Thank you.

5015
02:36:46,870 --> 02:36:47,230
Thank you.

5016
02:36:47,510 --> 02:36:49,470
No one ever gets it correct on the first try.

5017
02:36:49,550 --> 02:36:50,970
What's the support is that you never get out.

5018
02:36:51,110 --> 02:36:53,390
And you learn from yesterday's mistakes to make tomorrow a better place.

5019
02:36:53,390 --> 02:36:54,390
Thank you.

5020
02:36:54,450 --> 02:36:55,450
Thank you for the superchat.

5021
02:36:55,590 --> 02:36:55,770
Thank you.

5022
02:36:55,890 --> 02:36:56,350
Thank you.

5023
02:36:56,550 --> 02:36:57,570
I really appreciate it.

5024
02:36:57,650 --> 02:37:04,810
You just naturally shine so bright that companies and people can't help but be drawn to you.

5025
02:37:05,150 --> 02:37:06,490
Keep moving for it and we'll keep following.

5026
02:37:06,630 --> 02:37:07,170
Saying lots of love.

5027
02:37:07,310 --> 02:37:08,050
Thank you for the superchat.

5028
02:37:08,170 --> 02:37:08,410
Thank you.

5029
02:37:08,570 --> 02:37:09,070
Thank you.

5030
02:37:09,950 --> 02:37:22,990
Yeah, like... um... I remember like... uh... when... um... I think... I'm gonna like word- word this in my head before I say it... but I remember when, you know...

5031
02:37:23,790 --> 02:37:30,690
A lot of people behind the scenes helping me when I first got fired and everything.

5032
02:37:34,530 --> 02:37:36,170
It was a lot.

5033
02:37:36,370 --> 02:37:37,270
It was a lot.

5034
02:37:37,470 --> 02:37:44,270
But I really appreciate all the love and support, especially behind the scenes from people messaging me and everything.

5035
02:37:46,750 --> 02:37:49,530
And I really appreciate that.

5036
02:37:49,770 --> 02:37:51,950
And I grew a lot as a person too.

5037
02:37:51,950 --> 02:37:53,210
So, it meant a lot.

5038
02:37:54,770 --> 02:37:56,110
Okay, thank you for the super chat.

5039
02:37:56,250 --> 02:37:56,410
Thank you.

5040
02:37:56,510 --> 02:37:56,810
Thank you.

5041
02:37:56,910 --> 02:37:58,070
Doki, SMP, what is this?

5042
02:37:59,150 --> 02:38:00,850
It's a Minecraft server for members!

5043
02:38:00,850 --> 02:38:03,670
If you're a member, look into the community post.

5044
02:38:04,150 --> 02:38:06,350
Look into the community post and you can join...

5045
02:38:06,350 --> 02:38:08,510
You can get whitelisted before the server comes up.

5046
02:38:08,670 --> 02:38:11,870
The server won't be live until tomorrow when I stream, by the way.

5047
02:38:11,910 --> 02:38:14,170
For those who are wondering, it won't...

5048
02:38:14,170 --> 02:38:16,530
You can get whitelisted in advance.

5049
02:38:16,530 --> 02:38:23,070
And also, if there's any support you need before the server goes up.

5050
02:38:24,410 --> 02:38:25,530
Powerball, thank you for the super chat.

5051
02:38:25,670 --> 02:38:25,910
Thank you.

5052
02:38:25,990 --> 02:38:26,450
Thank you.

5053
02:38:26,510 --> 02:38:27,530
Doki, delegating work.

5054
02:38:27,690 --> 02:38:28,450
Thank you, Doki.

5055
02:38:28,670 --> 02:38:29,510
Thank you for the super chat.

5056
02:38:29,590 --> 02:38:29,830
Thank you.

5057
02:38:29,910 --> 02:38:30,410
Thank you.

5058
02:38:30,730 --> 02:38:31,690
It's in the members.

5059
02:38:31,870 --> 02:38:32,930
It's in the members community.

5060
02:38:33,050 --> 02:38:34,330
If you're a member, you'll see it.

5061
02:38:34,570 --> 02:38:34,730
Yeah.

5062
02:38:35,050 --> 02:38:36,390
You'll see it and everything.

5063
02:38:36,690 --> 02:38:36,970
Mm-hmm.

5064
02:38:37,490 --> 02:38:37,970
Yeah.

5065
02:38:39,450 --> 02:38:39,930
Um...

5066
02:38:39,930 --> 02:38:40,170
Um...

5067
02:38:40,510 --> 02:38:40,990
But yeah.

5068
02:38:41,270 --> 02:38:42,990
I really, really appreciate it all.

5069
02:38:43,110 --> 02:38:44,350
Guys, thank you all for the support.

5070
02:38:44,590 --> 02:38:46,430
I feel really mushy because...

5071
02:38:46,430 --> 02:38:48,230
You know, after all the events...

5072
02:38:48,230 --> 02:38:50,470
The last week that's been happening...

5073
02:38:50,470 --> 02:38:52,390
I just feel really mushy right now.

5074
02:38:52,690 --> 02:38:52,970
Hahaha!

5075
02:38:54,090 --> 02:38:56,230
Rodrigo, thank you for the five gift of the shows!

5076
02:38:56,410 --> 02:38:57,490
Thank you, thank you!

5077
02:38:58,110 --> 02:38:58,590
Um...

5078
02:38:58,590 --> 02:39:01,470
Just like I said, I couldn't be here without all of you guys.

5079
02:39:02,550 --> 02:39:03,030
Um...

5080
02:39:03,030 --> 02:39:03,890
And...

5081
02:39:03,890 --> 02:39:04,290
Um...

5082
02:39:04,290 --> 02:39:06,050
It was definitely very overwhelming.

5083
02:39:06,050 --> 02:39:09,990
It was very overwhelming when I had to do all of this.

5084
02:39:10,630 --> 02:39:11,030
Uh...

5085
02:39:11,030 --> 02:39:11,510
Like...

5086
02:39:11,510 --> 02:39:12,370
You know, when my...

5087
02:39:12,370 --> 02:39:13,950
The rug was pulled out from under me.

5088
02:39:14,110 --> 02:39:14,970
And I had to like...

5089
02:39:14,970 --> 02:39:16,930
Figure out how to do all of this myself.

5090
02:39:17,350 --> 02:39:17,750
Uh...

5091
02:39:17,750 --> 02:39:18,930
With a small group of people.

5092
02:39:19,610 --> 02:39:20,010
Um...

5093
02:39:20,010 --> 02:39:21,190
And like I said, we all had to learn.

5094
02:39:21,510 --> 02:39:21,850
We all had...

5095
02:39:21,850 --> 02:39:23,610
It was just trial and error and everything.

5096
02:39:24,390 --> 02:39:24,790
Um...

5097
02:39:24,790 --> 02:39:26,770
You know, I never had to run my own...

5098
02:39:26,770 --> 02:39:28,010
I mean, technically it's...

5099
02:39:28,010 --> 02:39:29,850
It's a company because...

5100
02:39:29,850 --> 02:39:30,270
But my...

5101
02:39:30,270 --> 02:39:32,050
The company is like based off of me.

5102
02:39:32,310 --> 02:39:32,690
Like...

5103
02:39:33,910 --> 02:39:35,010
Like my own brand.

5104
02:39:35,010 --> 02:39:35,910
Like...

5105
02:39:35,910 --> 02:39:37,250
It's not really a company company.

5106
02:39:37,590 --> 02:39:38,390
But like...

5107
02:39:38,390 --> 02:39:39,190
You know...

5108
02:39:39,190 --> 02:39:39,630
Um...

5109
02:39:39,630 --> 02:39:40,450
It is a business.

5110
02:39:40,950 --> 02:39:41,510
And my...

5111
02:39:41,510 --> 02:39:43,450
My company is just about me.

5112
02:39:45,050 --> 02:39:47,130
But I had so much to learn.

5113
02:39:47,930 --> 02:39:48,410
And...

5114
02:39:48,410 --> 02:39:49,330
Um...

5115
02:39:49,330 --> 02:39:52,050
I'm really thankful for how things turned out in the end.

5116
02:39:52,450 --> 02:39:52,930
Like...

5117
02:39:52,930 --> 02:39:53,310
You know...

5118
02:39:53,310 --> 02:39:55,110
I don't really want to waste this opportunity.

5119
02:39:55,550 --> 02:39:55,890
You know...

5120
02:39:55,890 --> 02:39:56,910
I don't want to squander it.

5121
02:39:56,910 --> 02:39:58,670
There were so many eyes on me at that time.

5122
02:39:59,010 --> 02:40:00,550
And it was definitely very overwhelming.

5123
02:40:03,090 --> 02:40:03,570
Um...

5124
02:40:03,570 --> 02:40:05,780
There were times where I did wish...

5125
02:40:06,730 --> 02:40:07,390
That...

5126
02:40:07,390 --> 02:40:07,830
Um...

5127
02:40:07,830 --> 02:40:08,770
I had...

5128
02:40:08,770 --> 02:40:09,730
Someone...

5129
02:40:09,730 --> 02:40:10,850
Offer me...

5130
02:40:10,850 --> 02:40:11,150
Like...

5131
02:40:11,150 --> 02:40:12,070
Corporate assistance.

5132
02:40:12,590 --> 02:40:13,250
Because...

5133
02:40:13,250 --> 02:40:15,010
I was very overwhelmed.

5134
02:40:15,350 --> 02:40:16,330
It was so much.

5135
02:40:16,610 --> 02:40:18,410
There were so many offers and stuff.

5136
02:40:18,710 --> 02:40:19,930
But it wasn't like...

5137
02:40:19,930 --> 02:40:20,550
You know...

5138
02:40:20,550 --> 02:40:22,250
It was outside the VTuber community.

5139
02:40:22,710 --> 02:40:23,610
So like...

5140
02:40:23,610 --> 02:40:25,610
There were so many offers for help.

5141
02:40:26,570 --> 02:40:27,230
Uh...

5142
02:40:27,230 --> 02:40:27,870
For like...

5143
02:40:27,870 --> 02:40:28,030
You know...

5144
02:40:28,300 --> 02:40:29,390
Sponsors and like...

5145
02:40:29,390 --> 02:40:29,890
Merch.

5146
02:40:29,890 --> 02:40:30,390
Well...

5147
02:40:30,390 --> 02:40:31,090
And stuff like that.

5148
02:40:32,050 --> 02:40:32,530
Um...

5149
02:40:32,530 --> 02:40:33,430
But it's like...

5150
02:40:33,430 --> 02:40:35,810
Outside of the VTuber community.

5151
02:40:36,170 --> 02:40:36,950
And like...

5152
02:40:36,950 --> 02:40:37,510
It's very hard.

5153
02:40:37,630 --> 02:40:38,450
Cause I- I don't know.

5154
02:40:38,550 --> 02:40:39,190
Cuz the thing is...

5155
02:40:39,190 --> 02:40:40,250
When there's help...

5156
02:40:40,250 --> 02:40:41,630
Outside of the VTuber community.

5157
02:40:41,950 --> 02:40:43,430
It's very hard to see like...

5158
02:40:43,430 --> 02:40:44,130
Which...

5159
02:40:44,130 --> 02:40:45,150
one to trust.

5160
02:40:45,630 --> 02:40:46,510
Because I didn't know...

5161
02:40:46,510 --> 02:40:52,990
I didn't have much knowledge about a lot of things like the marketing agencies.

5162
02:40:53,350 --> 02:41:02,150
I had so many offers from different marketing agencies, but I didn't know which one to trust or which one to sign and stuff like that.

5163
02:41:02,630 --> 02:41:09,030
Because a lot of these marketing agencies wanted to sign me, but that's not like a VTuber company, you know?

5164
02:41:09,490 --> 02:41:13,630
Or like a lot of talent agencies and stuff.

5165
02:41:14,930 --> 02:41:24,110
But I didn't know which one to sign and I didn't know who to trust because I already got out and I was like, I don't know.

5166
02:41:24,230 --> 02:41:25,090
It was so overwhelming.

5167
02:41:26,090 --> 02:41:28,270
That's why I never signed with a talent agency.

5168
02:41:28,510 --> 02:41:30,690
I never signed with a talent agency.

5169
02:41:30,930 --> 02:41:32,910
I never signed with a marketing agency.

5170
02:41:34,550 --> 02:41:35,690
They approached me.

5171
02:41:35,830 --> 02:41:37,230
If they have something, they approach me.

5172
02:41:37,850 --> 02:41:40,490
I'm not fully signed on to anything.

5173
02:41:42,110 --> 02:41:48,450
Because like, I don't know if you guys know this, but having an agent is like... I don't have like... I don't actually have an agent agent.

5174
02:41:48,990 --> 02:41:53,790
If an agent wants... some agents... I'm like, oh, what's the word called?

5175
02:41:54,170 --> 02:41:57,570
I have a manager and I have staff, but I don't have an agent agent.

5176
02:41:57,570 --> 02:42:05,750
I have several agents that come to me if there's a project that they have in mind that fits my criteria.

5177
02:42:06,210 --> 02:42:09,670
And they come to me and they just take a percentage off and that's fine.

5178
02:42:10,050 --> 02:42:17,970
Or the sponsors themselves reach out to me, like specifically reach out to me to like, I guess like cut the middleman out or something.

5179
02:42:18,530 --> 02:42:20,090
They just don't want a middleman involved.

5180
02:42:20,310 --> 02:42:22,650
So they're just like, oh, we'll just reach out to you specifically.

5181
02:42:22,650 --> 02:42:25,030
Yeah, I'm just like a freelance stuff.

5182
02:42:25,190 --> 02:42:29,770
So I don't really have like an actual agent that like...

5183
02:42:29,770 --> 02:42:32,650
But I have various agents that...

5184
02:42:34,570 --> 02:42:45,090
I have various agents that basically like bring me up if there's something that, you know, matches the sponsor or matches the collab or something like that.

5185
02:42:45,210 --> 02:42:45,610
Which works!

5186
02:42:45,730 --> 02:42:46,330
It works for me.

5187
02:42:46,630 --> 02:42:49,050
That's why you don't see me sign for any...

5188
02:42:49,050 --> 02:42:50,310
Maybe in the future, I would.

5189
02:42:50,510 --> 02:42:57,230
Maybe in the future, I would like, you know, take an offer or something like that.

5190
02:42:57,450 --> 02:43:00,830
But yeah, no, it was very overwhelming starting out.

5191
02:43:00,950 --> 02:43:02,730
But I'm happy with where we are now.

5192
02:43:03,870 --> 02:43:05,350
It was a lot of work to get here.

5193
02:43:05,510 --> 02:43:06,370
It was so tiring.

5194
02:43:06,650 --> 02:43:13,490
I've had like breakdowns in the past being like, I wish I was in a company right now with corporate assistance.

5195
02:43:13,490 --> 02:43:17,150
Because like, you know, like it was so much.

5196
02:43:17,310 --> 02:43:19,090
It was a lot of work.

5197
02:43:19,650 --> 02:43:22,170
And when you had so much work by yourself.

5198
02:43:22,410 --> 02:43:27,490
But even with a team, even with a team, I was like, I had like breakdowns being like, oh my gosh, this is...

5199
02:43:28,050 --> 02:43:35,170
Because it was like, you know, I wasn't used to that much workload in the past.

5200
02:43:35,250 --> 02:43:36,230
And it was a lot to learn.

5201
02:43:36,230 --> 02:43:40,030
And I made so many mistakes to getting to where I am today.

5202
02:43:40,690 --> 02:43:45,330
Um, yeah, it was like, like, I'm happy with where I am at now.

5203
02:43:45,890 --> 02:43:48,570
But it took a long journey to get there.

5204
02:43:49,230 --> 02:43:50,470
Learning from everything.

5205
02:43:50,470 --> 02:43:56,770
Um, and, um, like with the, even with, you know, I had so much freedom.

5206
02:43:57,710 --> 02:44:02,090
But I had to still make the right decision with all that freedom.

5207
02:44:02,670 --> 02:44:05,210
Um, yeah.

5208
02:44:06,190 --> 02:44:15,410
Um, uh, yeah, so I even like at one point, um, it's actually really funny.

5209
02:44:15,410 --> 02:44:27,010
At one point, um, I won't say like what, which orgs, but like, I asked like several esport orgs if they were willing to, you know, like, like just propose an idea.

5210
02:44:27,390 --> 02:44:30,110
Being like, how you guys, do you guys want to sign like, you know, a VTuber?

5211
02:44:30,370 --> 02:44:34,110
Like, you know, you sign less streamers, but like, how about VTubers?

5212
02:44:34,230 --> 02:44:39,170
But I even like brought that up to esport orgs too, because I was like, hey.

5213
02:44:39,170 --> 02:44:41,130
Uh, hahaha.

5214
02:44:45,110 --> 02:44:45,630
Yeah.

5215
02:44:46,110 --> 02:44:53,330
Like, it even got to like that point, cause I was just, like the transition period was so overwhelming.

5216
02:44:53,670 --> 02:44:53,830
Yeah.

5217
02:44:56,950 --> 02:45:00,550
It was, it was just, uh, it was so much work.

5218
02:45:00,710 --> 02:45:06,090
But in the end, I'm happy with where, like, like, obviously you don't see me on an esport org.

5219
02:45:08,810 --> 02:45:11,290
You know, see me in an esport org.

5220
02:45:11,650 --> 02:45:16,330
Um, cause obviously it didn't work out in the end, like during like negotiations and stuff.

5221
02:45:16,950 --> 02:45:23,770
Um, and honestly, like, I'm, like I said, um, I'm happy with where I'm at.

5222
02:45:23,770 --> 02:45:25,370
I don't know what I was saying.

5223
02:45:25,650 --> 02:45:28,630
I'm glad the negotiations in the end didn't work out.

5224
02:45:29,330 --> 02:45:36,090
Um, um, cause you know, we had two, we had like different expectations basically of each other.

5225
02:45:36,350 --> 02:45:38,590
We had different expectations for each other.

5226
02:45:38,770 --> 02:45:46,230
So like, um, um, so it's not like, you know, oh, like I didn't like what they wanted.

5227
02:45:46,230 --> 02:45:51,210
Like I didn't like the contracts or no, it was, we just had different expectations of what we wanted to do.

5228
02:45:51,490 --> 02:45:54,750
So like, obviously, you know, it didn't work out in the end.

5229
02:45:55,130 --> 02:46:02,570
Um, but I don't want to say like, oh, you know, like, oh, uh, but you know, what could have been.

5230
02:46:02,770 --> 02:46:04,530
It's more so of like, what could have been.

5231
02:46:04,710 --> 02:46:08,150
But, and in the end, I'm, I'm happy with where I'm at.

5232
02:46:08,150 --> 02:46:13,710
My man, I don't know if my manager is awake, but he's gonna be like, bullshit, you cried so much.

5233
02:46:18,210 --> 02:46:21,310
But look, in retrospective, I'm reflecting.

5234
02:46:21,330 --> 02:46:22,970
I'm reflecting right now.

5235
02:46:23,310 --> 02:46:33,950
I'm, in the past, in the, in the past, you know, I would cry about it.

5236
02:46:33,950 --> 02:46:37,070
He'd be like, come on, it's so much work.

5237
02:46:37,070 --> 02:46:38,090
I'm so tired.

5238
02:46:38,430 --> 02:46:39,670
I'm so tired.

5239
02:46:40,290 --> 02:46:47,810
And you'd be like, oh, why don't you like, you know, um, maybe, you know, we could ask this company or something.

5240
02:46:47,990 --> 02:46:50,610
And I'd be like, oh, no, no, I don't know.

5241
02:46:52,690 --> 02:46:54,190
Oh, I don't know.

5242
02:46:57,150 --> 02:47:03,830
It feels, oh, I feel like, cause like at one point, cause my manager would be like, oh, how about you ask.

5243
02:47:03,830 --> 02:47:07,950
You know, well, maybe you can ask this company, like if they want to take you in.

5244
02:47:08,090 --> 02:47:11,470
And then, you know, and I was like, oh, I feel so pathetic.

5245
02:47:11,890 --> 02:47:17,230
I'd be like, oh, I feel so pathetic.

5246
02:47:17,690 --> 02:47:22,090
Like, I think about it.

5247
02:47:22,210 --> 02:47:23,030
I'll wait tomorrow.

5248
02:47:23,630 --> 02:47:25,550
I'll wait tomorrow and see it.

5249
02:47:25,550 --> 02:47:27,590
Cause I'll be like, no, I feel pathetic.

5250
02:47:27,750 --> 02:47:29,510
They didn't even offer me anything.

5251
02:47:30,070 --> 02:47:31,850
They didn't even approach me.

5252
02:47:32,050 --> 02:47:34,990
I feel, I'll think about it.

5253
02:47:43,210 --> 02:47:47,250
Like, I don't, what if they say no?

5254
02:47:47,570 --> 02:47:50,050
I was like, I was like, what if they say no?

5255
02:47:50,190 --> 02:47:51,350
Then I'll feel worse.

5256
02:47:56,630 --> 02:48:00,950
Um, but in the end, I'm glad it all worked out in the end.

5257
02:48:01,110 --> 02:48:02,290
I'm glad it all.

5258
02:48:03,010 --> 02:48:05,630
I mean, like reflecting it.

5259
02:48:06,030 --> 02:48:08,290
And yeah, I was spiraling it.

5260
02:48:11,950 --> 02:48:13,410
That fear of rejection.

5261
02:48:13,690 --> 02:48:13,750
Yeah.

5262
02:48:13,870 --> 02:48:15,910
I know you guys are like, yo, the worst they can say is no.

5263
02:48:16,050 --> 02:48:19,790
But I was, I was very, I was in a sensitive spot there.

5264
02:48:19,830 --> 02:48:21,530
I couldn't even take a no at that point.

5265
02:48:21,670 --> 02:48:23,870
I was like, I was like, you guys don't understand.

5266
02:48:23,870 --> 02:48:25,550
I couldn't take a no guys.

5267
02:48:25,590 --> 02:48:34,670
I was just like, I couldn't, I couldn't take it around that time.

5268
02:48:40,750 --> 02:48:42,150
But now we have a team.

5269
02:48:42,370 --> 02:48:46,370
Now we've built a team that I'm very confident around.

5270
02:48:46,930 --> 02:48:49,970
And, um, they, they do a lot.

5271
02:48:50,330 --> 02:48:56,590
Like our team is getting bigger and bigger, but like in a way where I can afford it.

5272
02:49:01,200 --> 02:49:02,680
That's what I mean.

5273
02:49:02,680 --> 02:49:09,100
Um, in a way that I can afford the bigger, I can afford the team.

5274
02:49:09,440 --> 02:49:10,700
Um, oh, we're the back.

5275
02:49:10,860 --> 02:49:12,200
Oh, was the BGM doubled?

5276
02:49:12,220 --> 02:49:13,280
I'm so sorry.

5277
02:49:13,500 --> 02:49:14,340
That must've been.

5278
02:49:14,780 --> 02:49:16,200
So, I'm sorry.

5279
02:49:16,420 --> 02:49:22,580
That must've been like, really, really hard to listen to.

5280
02:49:22,720 --> 02:49:24,300
Oh man, I didn't even realize.

5281
02:49:24,300 --> 02:49:34,640
Um, um, so, uh, um, oh, now you can't unhear it anywhere.

5282
02:49:34,940 --> 02:49:36,200
Oh, that's good.

5283
02:49:36,300 --> 02:49:37,560
Now people won't watch the end.

5284
02:49:41,020 --> 02:49:45,180
No one can know how vulnerable I was at the end of super chat reading.

5285
02:49:45,180 --> 02:49:46,140
That's right.

5286
02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:49,680
Hahaha!

5287
02:49:50,960 --> 02:49:51,400
Hahaha!

5288
02:49:52,960 --> 02:49:57,760
Um, um, and our team is getting bigger and our team is getting more experience too.

5289
02:49:58,220 --> 02:50:02,880
Um, more experience on how to handle all the stuff that's going on.

5290
02:50:03,160 --> 02:50:06,300
And yeah, it's been quite a journey everyone.

5291
02:50:06,820 --> 02:50:07,940
It really has been.

5292
02:50:07,940 --> 02:50:15,480
And I hope everyone in the VTuber community lands on their feet.

5293
02:50:15,740 --> 02:50:25,780
I know a lot of people might not be as lucky as I was, and a lot of people have their own struggles and their own journey to go on.

5294
02:50:26,340 --> 02:50:31,980
I hope in the end everyone finds their path, like how I found my path in the end.

5295
02:50:31,980 --> 02:50:38,580
Like I thought, I thought I had to be, I thought in the past I had to be corporate to be successful.

5296
02:50:39,080 --> 02:50:44,580
But like, to do the things I want, well not just successful, but to do the things I want to do.

5297
02:50:44,940 --> 02:50:51,060
Like I have such, I have so many ideas and so much ambition and a lot of goals I want to do.

5298
02:50:51,340 --> 02:50:58,640
And it's, you know, doing it by myself with my team, it was so much work.

5299
02:50:58,640 --> 02:51:03,920
So, um, we're like getting there, you know, we're get, we're getting there.

5300
02:51:04,420 --> 02:51:05,580
No, we're getting there.

5301
02:51:10,800 --> 02:51:13,660
Um, and yeah, we accomplished a lot.

5302
02:51:14,060 --> 02:51:24,140
And I hope I continue to grow as a person and continue to, um, you know, continue to do the things I want to be able to do.

5303
02:51:24,140 --> 02:51:28,300
So, and then I hit a million subscribers and I peace out and disappear.

5304
02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:29,960
I'm joking!

5305
02:51:30,220 --> 02:51:31,020
I'm joking!

5306
02:51:49,340 --> 02:51:51,380
Please, please, please, don't unsubscribe.

5307
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:54,920
Please, millions, I'll still be here.

5308
02:51:54,940 --> 02:51:57,020
I'll still be here after a million subscribers.

5309
02:51:57,280 --> 02:51:58,580
I, I still be here.

5310
02:51:58,700 --> 02:52:00,160
I swear, please, don't unsubscribe.

5311
02:52:00,160 --> 02:52:00,900
I was joking.

5312
02:52:00,900 --> 02:52:01,780
The second one is J.aky J.k.

5313
02:52:02,960 --> 02:52:04,120
slash J.K...

5314
02:52:09,260 --> 02:52:12,240
I actually have something special planned in a million- not leaving.

5315
02:52:12,540 --> 02:52:13,980
I have a special...

5316
02:52:13,980 --> 02:52:18,720
a special stream slash announcement slash like, thing.

5317
02:52:18,900 --> 02:52:20,620
Out of a million subscribers, guys.

5318
02:52:20,780 --> 02:52:23,900
So you guys, please, you guys wanna see the special announcement, right?

5319
02:52:23,920 --> 02:52:27,420
I actually have something very special planned out of a million subscribers.

5320
02:52:27,420 --> 02:52:29,460
I swear it is not a graduation.

5321
02:52:29,460 --> 02:52:31,180
I swear to God.

5322
02:52:31,420 --> 02:52:33,740
I swear to God.

5323
02:52:35,840 --> 02:52:36,320
Um...

5324
02:52:40,520 --> 02:52:41,280
But yeah.

5325
02:52:41,820 --> 02:52:42,980
Thank you, everyone.

5326
02:52:43,180 --> 02:52:43,560
Thank you, bro.

5327
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:45,980
Sorry, I got really mushy and emotional there.

5328
02:52:46,160 --> 02:52:49,280
The last, like, three days has been a lot.

5329
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:53,580
Like, obviously, like, it's been more for a lot of people that were actually affected.

5330
02:52:54,040 --> 02:52:58,360
Um, but it got me, like, super... it got me in a super reflective mood.

5331
02:52:58,360 --> 02:53:04,720
Um, just looking back at my, like, looking back at, like, you know, the history of my career.

5332
02:53:05,060 --> 02:53:10,720
And I got... I got, like, super reflective and... about it and everything.

5333
02:53:10,980 --> 02:53:12,520
And I've been thinking a lot about it, too.

5334
02:53:13,180 --> 02:53:16,860
Um, um, so I got super mushy there today.

5335
02:53:18,900 --> 02:53:25,560
You know, there was, like, I even, like, typed up a lot of stuff that was in my head while I was, like, um...

5336
02:53:25,560 --> 02:53:26,840
That was all going on.

5337
02:53:27,120 --> 02:53:33,060
And in the end, even though, like, I never got really got any offers after I got fired, I'm sort of glad I didn't.

5338
02:53:33,180 --> 02:53:35,840
I... I was at a very vulnerable place back then.

5339
02:53:36,140 --> 02:53:39,380
Like, I feel like if I did get one, I would have taken it.

5340
02:53:39,860 --> 02:53:43,380
Um, because of how vulnerable I was.

5341
02:53:44,060 --> 02:53:53,720
Um, and, like, I'm glad I didn't get poached because I was able to build all of this up and, like, have all of these connections now.

5342
02:53:54,340 --> 02:53:55,540
Um, and everything.

5343
02:53:56,000 --> 02:54:00,140
So, um, I didn't mean, like, you know, any offer, you know?

5344
02:54:00,320 --> 02:54:01,840
I wouldn't just say any offer.

5345
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:08,000
But, you know, back then, you know, when, you know, back then, like, in hindsight, obviously, like, you know...

5346
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:12,200
Bishoujo was a company that everyone thought was too good to be true.

5347
02:54:12,820 --> 02:54:14,440
And it was too good to be true.

5348
02:54:14,940 --> 02:54:15,100
Yeah.

5349
02:54:15,700 --> 02:54:17,280
Um, and obviously, like...

5350
02:54:19,440 --> 02:54:20,280
I had...

5351
02:54:20,280 --> 02:54:24,920
I read some comments of people being, like, oh, maybe they were scared.

5352
02:54:25,640 --> 02:54:29,880
Because, you know, I went through a lot, too, back then.

5353
02:54:31,660 --> 02:54:32,700
And, um...

5354
02:54:32,700 --> 02:54:37,360
And I guess, like, maybe they thought that I would have noticed something was wrong.

5355
02:54:39,200 --> 02:54:40,300
A lot earlier.

5356
02:54:41,040 --> 02:54:42,440
Because I'd be like, wait a minute.

5357
02:54:43,580 --> 02:54:44,960
I played these games before.

5358
02:54:48,880 --> 02:54:51,160
And I was like, oh, wait, yeah, that makes sense.

5359
02:54:51,300 --> 02:54:52,260
That actually...

5360
02:54:52,760 --> 02:54:53,900
I was like, wait a minute.

5361
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:54,960
Wait, yeah, that...

5362
02:54:54,960 --> 02:54:55,620
That...

5363
02:54:55,620 --> 02:54:56,440
That would...

5364
02:54:56,440 --> 02:54:58,300
That actually made sense.

5365
02:54:58,500 --> 02:54:58,620
Yeah.

5366
02:55:02,420 --> 02:55:03,820
Yeah, I'd be like, wait a minute.

5367
02:55:05,020 --> 02:55:06,540
I played these games before.

5368
02:55:11,260 --> 02:55:13,900
Because I am a very outspoken person.

5369
02:55:14,960 --> 02:55:21,120
Like, I basically fight for what's right in the past and current.

5370
02:55:22,600 --> 02:55:25,140
Like, if I think something's not right, I do butt heads.

5371
02:55:25,580 --> 02:55:27,320
And, like, because I have done that.

5372
02:55:27,560 --> 02:55:28,920
And I think something's not right.

5373
02:55:29,200 --> 02:55:36,400
And, like, I remember I would fight for a lot of permit perms and stuff back then.

5374
02:55:37,280 --> 02:55:39,360
And found, like, ways to get perms.

5375
02:55:39,440 --> 02:55:42,180
I remember, like, there was a game that we all wanted to play.

5376
02:55:42,200 --> 02:55:44,860
And I would literally... I literally went on a Discord server.

5377
02:55:45,200 --> 02:55:51,440
Like, the devs... Like, the game devs Discord server to get us, like, perms and stuff.

5378
02:55:51,580 --> 02:55:55,360
Because I was, like... I would get on an anonymous account and be like, hey, guys.

5379
02:55:55,900 --> 02:56:00,440
I was wondering, are you guys allowed over... Like, are you guys allowed people to stream it?

5380
02:56:00,600 --> 02:56:03,020
Some countries don't have good copyright laws.

5381
02:56:03,240 --> 02:56:04,180
They don't have... What was it called?

5382
02:56:05,220 --> 02:56:06,240
Fair use laws.

5383
02:56:06,240 --> 02:56:07,700
And so, I just wanted to know.

5384
02:56:07,900 --> 02:56:08,060
Yeah.

5385
02:56:13,060 --> 02:56:13,500
Yeah.

5386
02:56:13,500 --> 02:56:15,320
And I would, like, actually look... Yeah.

5387
02:56:15,780 --> 02:56:16,800
Stuff like that.

5388
02:56:17,800 --> 02:56:19,340
And they're like, oh, wow.

5389
02:56:19,540 --> 02:56:19,780
Really?

5390
02:56:20,240 --> 02:56:20,700
Well, yeah.

5391
02:56:20,840 --> 02:56:23,040
You got people overseas can stream our game.

5392
02:56:27,720 --> 02:56:29,400
Asking for a friend, by the way.

5393
02:56:29,620 --> 02:56:31,160
I'm just asking for a friend.

5394
02:56:32,180 --> 02:56:34,580
My friend's a streamer and she wanted to know.

5395
02:56:37,060 --> 02:56:38,220
Thank you for the super chat.

5396
02:56:38,320 --> 02:56:38,500
Thank you.

5397
02:56:38,580 --> 02:56:38,980
Thank you.

5398
02:56:39,180 --> 02:56:41,620
I hope you realize how much all of us dragoons appreciate and love you.

5399
02:56:41,700 --> 02:56:42,640
You're our light in the dark.

5400
02:56:42,800 --> 02:56:43,220
Kind of the light.

5401
02:56:43,440 --> 02:56:46,700
I'm glad that out of all of you YouTubers out there, you can be my Kamioshi.

5402
02:56:47,400 --> 02:56:47,880
Love you.

I really appreciate it.

5407
02:56:50,720 --> 02:56:52,000
I'm happy to be your Kamioshi.

5408
02:56:52,620 --> 02:56:53,880
For as long as you'll have me.

5409
02:56:55,200 --> 02:56:56,580
Swizznate, welcome to the tomato farm.

5410

Welcome.

5412

Thank you.

5414
02:56:59,760 --> 02:57:00,120
Thank you.

5415
02:57:00,200 --> 02:57:00,900
I know that feeling.

5416
02:57:01,080 --> 02:57:02,100
I'm definitely emotional this week.

5417
02:57:02,340 --> 02:57:03,500
So glad you're here with us.

5418
02:57:03,580 --> 02:57:04,960
It was a struggle, but you made it.

5419
02:57:05,020 --> 02:57:05,700
Thank you for the super chat.

5420
02:57:05,800 --> 02:57:06,000
Thank you.

Next to you.

02:57:07,520 --> 02:57:08,280
Thank you for the super chat.

5424
02:57:08,360 --> 02:57:08,560
Thank you.

5425
02:57:08,640 --> 02:57:09,120
Thank you.

5426
02:57:09,540 --> 02:57:10,840
Everything worked out for the best.

5427
02:57:10,960 --> 02:57:13,120
I was thinking about how we're living in the best timeline right now.

5428
02:57:13,420 --> 02:57:14,400
Thank you for the super chat.

5429
02:57:14,500 --> 02:57:14,800
Thank you.

Thank you for the super chat.

5433
02:57:16,800 --> 02:57:17,040
Thank you.

5434
02:57:17,100 --> 02:57:17,560
Thank you.

5435
02:57:17,720 --> 02:57:19,960
Looking forward to seeing everything you have in store for us.

5436
02:57:20,040 --> 02:57:22,820
This journey with you and the dragoons have been a blast to be part of.

5437
02:57:23,120 --> 02:57:24,880
You've grown so much and I always keep saying this.

5438
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:26,380
I'm so freaking proud of you, Doki.

5439
02:57:26,560 --> 02:57:27,020
Thank you.

5440
02:57:27,020 --> 02:57:28,300

I'm proud of you guys too!

5443
02:57:30,860 --> 02:57:34,620
We grew a lot as a community together, so I'm really proud of all of us.

5444
02:57:34,820 --> 02:57:38,300
Like, I couldn't be able to do all of this without you guys too.

5445
02:57:39,300 --> 02:57:40,640
Mustard, thank you for the super chat.

5446
02:57:40,800 --> 02:57:41,700
Thank you, thank you.

Thank you, thank you.

5453

Oh my god, you're getting me out of here.

Thank you for the super chat.

5455

Thank you.

5460
02:57:58,880 --> 02:57:59,740
You'll be back.

5461
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,520
You love money too much.

5462
02:58:02,960 --> 02:58:04,580
Thank you for the super chat.

5463
02:58:04,800 --> 02:58:05,280
Thank you.

Thank you.

5465
02:58:13,240 --> 02:58:19,080
Yeah, I'm just proud of our journey together, Dragoon.

5466
02:58:19,180 --> 02:58:22,880
Like I said, I couldn't be here without all of your support and everything.

5467
02:58:23,200 --> 02:58:25,000
Can't do the things I do without you guys.

5468
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:26,480
Billy, thank you for the super chat.

5469
02:58:26,620 --> 02:58:26,860
Thank you.

5470
02:58:26,980 --> 02:58:27,460
Thank you.

5471
02:58:27,760 --> 02:58:28,340
Hi, Doki.

5472
02:58:28,520 --> 02:58:31,920
I used to watch you with another member account, but I just want to say thank you here.

5473
02:58:32,100 --> 02:58:32,380
Thank you.

5474
02:58:32,480 --> 02:58:33,040
Thank you.

5475
02:58:33,160 --> 02:58:34,060
Thank you, Billy.

5476
02:58:34,420 --> 02:58:37,580
And also, you're the one that clips me, right?

5477
02:58:37,740 --> 02:58:39,780
And translates me in Chinese.

5478
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:40,600
So thank you.

5479
02:58:40,880 --> 02:58:48,980
I love people who clip me around the world to translate my stuff for people, for my overseas fans and everything.

5480
02:58:49,100 --> 02:58:50,320
I really appreciate it.

5481
02:58:50,380 --> 02:58:54,340
I really appreciate all my community for, you know, spreading the word of Doki.

5482
02:58:59,300 --> 02:58:59,580
Doki.

5483
02:58:59,580 --> 02:59:00,700

02:59:01,180 --> 02:59:01,780
Thank you.

5486
02:59:01,940 --> 02:59:02,380
Thank you.

5487
02:59:02,380 --> 02:59:03,720
Thank you for kindly sharing what it was like.

5488
02:59:03,840 --> 02:59:04,600
We're happy you made it here.

5489
02:59:04,700 --> 02:59:05,140
Thank you.

5490
02:59:05,280 --> 02:59:06,880
Rice, Ivan, thank you for the super chat.

5491
02:59:06,960 --> 02:59:07,140
Thank you.

5492
02:59:07,240 --> 02:59:07,560
Thank you.

5493
02:59:07,640 --> 02:59:08,320
All things can do it.

5494
02:59:08,420 --> 02:59:10,460
You've come out of the fire stronger than ever.

5495
02:59:10,580 --> 02:59:11,260
Thank you for the super chat.

5496
02:59:11,380 --> 02:59:11,600
Thank you.

5497
02:59:11,740 --> 02:59:12,280
Thank you.

5498
02:59:16,020 --> 02:59:17,740
Doom, thank you for the super chat.

5499
02:59:17,940 --> 02:59:18,220
Thank you.

5500
02:59:18,400 --> 02:59:19,020
Thank you.

5501
02:59:19,960 --> 02:59:20,720
Alright, guys.

5502
02:59:21,560 --> 02:59:22,940
One more super chat.

5503
02:59:23,120 --> 02:59:24,100
Thank you for the super chat.

5504
02:59:24,220 --> 02:59:24,440
Thank you.

5505
02:59:24,540 --> 02:59:24,840
Thank you.

5506
02:59:24,940 --> 02:59:27,360
With how Doki is talking, maybe she is graduating.

5507
02:59:27,820 --> 02:59:29,500
No, I swear to God, it's not.

5508
02:59:29,700 --> 02:59:32,000
The special announcement is not a graduate.

5509
02:59:32,320 --> 02:59:33,640
I'm not leaving at a million.

5510
02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:36,180
It was just JK slash JK.

5511
02:59:36,440 --> 02:59:38,900
It's actually a million and a one.

5512
02:59:41,840 --> 02:59:44,340
JK slash... Slash JK, guys.

5513
02:59:44,620 --> 02:59:45,620
Slash JK.

5514
02:59:48,260 --> 02:59:48,780
Yeah.

5515
02:59:49,200 --> 02:59:51,040
In the end, alright, my final thoughts.

5516
02:59:51,220 --> 02:59:56,020
In the end, I hope everyone supports and keep doing what they love in the VTuber community.

5517
02:59:56,220 --> 02:59:59,560
Support everyone in the VTuber community.

5518
03:00:00,820 --> 03:00:02,520
Support... I like the phrasing.

5519
03:00:02,820 --> 03:00:04,040
They're like, support the talents.

5520
03:00:05,400 --> 03:00:08,360
Talents is really the most important part.

5521
03:00:08,900 --> 03:00:09,980
Uh, of it.

5522
03:00:10,880 --> 03:00:11,620
Um, yeah.

5523
03:00:11,760 --> 03:00:15,560
Believe in, like, um, believe in their dreams and everything.

5524
03:00:16,100 --> 03:00:21,320
And, um, I hope everyone finds the path that they're meant to find in the end.

5525
03:00:21,720 --> 03:00:23,260
Um, and yeah.

5526
03:00:23,460 --> 03:00:26,940
It's been quite a week for the VTuber community, really.

5527
03:00:27,400 --> 03:00:31,260
It's been a fucking crazy week and everything.

5528
03:00:31,860 --> 03:00:35,140
Um, and I hope, um...

5529
03:00:35,740 --> 03:00:39,740
I hope everyone has the resolution that they wanted in the end.

5530
03:00:41,100 --> 03:00:41,540
Um...

5531
03:00:41,540 --> 03:00:41,920
But, yeah.

5532
03:00:42,120 --> 03:00:43,320
I'm gonna end it there.

5533
03:00:43,560 --> 03:00:46,060
I'll read one last Super Chat, which is from Tia.

5534
03:00:46,500 --> 03:00:47,480
In the Super Chat, thank you.

5535
03:00:47,620 --> 03:00:48,120
Thank you.

5536
03:00:48,120 --> 03:00:49,880
Thank you for working hard despite it being hard.

5537
03:00:49,940 --> 03:00:50,760
You inspire us.

5538
03:00:50,860 --> 03:00:51,420
Thank you.

5539
03:00:51,520 --> 03:00:52,520
I really appreciate it.

5540
03:00:52,520 --> 03:00:54,380
And if it's, like, super overwhelming, guys.

5541
03:00:54,560 --> 03:00:58,820
If it's all too overwhelming with everything that, you know, all the news that's come out, just...

5542
03:00:58,820 --> 03:00:59,880
Take a break.

5543
03:01:00,420 --> 03:01:02,080
Um, for a little bit.

5544
03:01:02,220 --> 03:01:03,200
Because I'll still be here.

5545
03:01:03,560 --> 03:01:05,220
I'll still be here for you guys.

5546
03:01:05,460 --> 03:01:12,820
So, if you need a rest, if you guys need to, you know, get offline a little bit and rest and, you know, go outside.

5547
03:01:12,820 --> 03:01:16,020
I know outside just feels very dangerous, but...

5548
03:01:17,460 --> 03:01:19,260
But if it helps your mental...

5549
03:01:19,260 --> 03:01:20,440
You know, I'll be here.

5550
03:01:20,880 --> 03:01:22,760
I'll be here for you guys.

5551
03:01:23,240 --> 03:01:24,520
You can always return here.

5552
03:01:24,920 --> 03:01:26,980
I'll still be doing the same old shit.

5553
03:01:30,700 --> 03:01:33,800
I'll still be doing the same old thing here.

5554
03:01:34,220 --> 03:01:38,260
Um, I might be... I might be on the moon, but I'm still here.

5555
03:01:41,380 --> 03:01:42,060
Hey, guys.

5556
03:01:42,240 --> 03:01:44,060
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

5557
03:01:44,540 --> 03:01:45,100
Posture check.

5558
03:01:45,380 --> 03:01:46,900
Get around to get that blood flowing.

5559
03:01:47,060 --> 03:01:48,800
And if you, except for me, head to bed.

5560
03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:50,180
Because you deserve it.

5561
03:01:50,340 --> 03:01:51,580
I'll see you guys next time, everyone.

5562
03:01:52,240 --> 03:01:53,000
Bye, guys.

5563
03:01:53,860 --> 03:01:54,260
Bye.

5564
03:01:54,260 --> 03:01:54,500
Bye.
