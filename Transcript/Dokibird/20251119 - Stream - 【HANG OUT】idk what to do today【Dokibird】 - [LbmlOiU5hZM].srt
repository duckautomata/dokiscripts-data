1
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,860
Hello, everyone.

2
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,640
Hello, I'm sorry.

3
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,880
I'm sorry for being late.

4
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,460
I literally was about to start and then I got the email
about the

5
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,580
VTuber Marvel Rivals thing.

6
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,560
I was just like, oh, okay, let me look through this.

7
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:15,660
And I was just like, I got really worried because like I
want this tournament to like go well, you know?

8
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,500
I don't know.

9
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,300
I was just, because there's only two tank players in this
tournament.

10
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,240
And, like, there's a lot of people that are like, I can
off-roll.

11
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,700
Because it's like, first choices.

12
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,240
Like, what's your main role?

13
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,760
And then they're like, okay, but what's your off-roll then?

14
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,480
So, you know, obviously, some of these players can off-roll.

15
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,000
But, you know, I can say I can off-roll as DPS.

16
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,980
But my off-roll as DPS is, like, plat.

17
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,640
Or some shit.

18
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,340
So it's not like, you know, I hit E-turn.

19
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:58,740
as support but then if I try to off-roll and I barely play
off-roll too so there's like some people that do play tank

20
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:12,360
as an off-roll but like I only have one person that does
that on my team so I got some I'm like well I see some teams

21
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:20,620
they do have off-rolls for tank there's one team that has
zero tank players I'm worried about them I don't know maybe

22
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:27,220
they'll surprise me maybe they don't need a tank player
they'll just they'll just like actually no they have okay

23
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:33,640
actually they have one it's like DPS and tank I think
they'll just like maybe they'll they have like and they have

24
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:42,260
an insane DPS player who needs a tank if you have an insane
DPS player to be fair um and but There is one team that has

25
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,400
like three, four off-rollers who can play tank.

26
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,720
So, like, uh, so there's that.

27
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:55,160
So it's like, I'm like, it's, it's really sad that we don't
have any B-Tuber tank players, which is understandable

28
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,600
because who the fuck wants to play tank?

29
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,910
I won't reveal, like, I, it's like, there's some people here
that will be very surprised that are participating here.

30
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,550
So I won't reveal who the people are, um, um, that are
participating.

31
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:12,690
Um.

32
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:20,830
and like I'll let you guys when it's revealed you guys would
know the thing is I'm like scared because I do want this to

33
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:28,470
be go well and like balancing is the hardest part but
there's no fucking vtuber tank players I'm so not surprised

34
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:36,530
because who wants to play tank it is actually like you gotta
be a masochist to want to play fucking tank anyway so I was

35
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:45,610
assigned captain but my concern like I'll be like you know
I'll be like super um straightforward with you guys I'll be

36
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:54,910
very transparent guys I don't want to be a captain I think I
have to be because like in my head if you're assigned

37
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:05,190
captain um um and if you're assigned captain it means like
you know you have like because it's it's a pre-assigned team

38
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:15,370
and um it's a pre-assigned team so I'm like why do we why do
I have to be captain I know it's like it's just a title but

39
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:24,830
I don't want the responsibility especially if it's a free
assigned team I'm I don't like responsibility if I if I have

40
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:34,750
no say in in what happened so yeah so I did email asking can
I like give up my

41
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,570
I just don't feel comfortable being a captain.

42
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,730
I just don't feel comfortable being a captain if there's no
captain duties.

43
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,810
You know what I'm saying?

44
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:57,530
I just wanted like, if there's no actual captain, like I'm
not drafting for players.

45
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,670
I'm not making the team or anything.

46
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,090
So I just feel like it's just a name.

47
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:09,950
So I'm like, it's possible if I just, I don't want, because
like, if anything happens to my team, people be like, Jokey

48
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,170
Brain.

49
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,910
And I just don't want that.

50
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,970
I don't want that.

51
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,670
If we get last place, they'll be like, Oh, Jokey Brain.

52
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,670
I'm like, no.

53
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,250
I don't, I don't want, don't, don't leave your name out of
your mouth.

54
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,570
Leave my name out of your mouth.

55
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,470
I was, I've got nothing to do with this.

56
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:52,070
Patrick has to think it was super chat thank you thank you
so humble we need a captain to keep it so that's like sorry

57
00:06:52,070 --> 00:07:00,910
that's why I was late because I was like asking like um can
I give up my captain's spot I don't know maybe there's just

58
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:11,530
be like no and I'll be like okay I don't know you know it
doesn't hurt to ask it You know, it doesn't hurt to ask if

59
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,710
it's okay, but I don't know.

60
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:21,530
I feel like I feel like I'm still going to be captain, but
I'm just worried.

61
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,970
You know, I always get like super paranoid about these
tournaments.

62
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:29,350
It's like a double-edged sword because like there's so many
support players I feel like.

63
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:39,950
And I also was like saying like what I'm worried about is
that they think I haven't even played the new season yet i

64
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:47,170
haven't even played gambit i think if i was gambit maybe i
can carry but the thing is it it's considered a four fun

65
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:57,170
tournament but the literally first place is 7.5k thousand
dollars like 7.5k dollars that's like even though it's four

66
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:04,170
fun you know it's still a lot of money so it's not per
person obviously it's divided by six but like you know

67
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:13,090
everyone wins every team um every i mean you have to you
have to have prize money like you can't it's hard to make a

68
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:19,950
for fun tournament but also like make it fun for people to
watch as well you know because it's sponsored by marvel

69
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:26,210
rivals it is sponsored by you can't really blame them on
that because like you know it puts more stake into it and it

70
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:32,350
is sponsored by marvel rivals so of course you're gonna like
you know put in sponsor money into the like put a prize pool

71
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:42,950
and them and it's like you know it helps motivate to people
to so it's hard you can't really um it's hard to make it for

72
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:48,810
fun like you know my apex tournament had prize money too and
obviously people took it very seriously as well um you know

73
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:54,290
i was trying to push the for fun angle on it but you know
that's why i try to balance it with like you know fun game

74
00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:00,190
modes where you don't really require aim but it's hard to
get people to participate if you don't have prize money and

75
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:07,770
everything so it makes sense like you know you want to put
more cred to your tournament so it makes sense to have um to

76
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:14,910
have a prize pool it like these tournaments always makes me
so fucking scared and paranoid because like i don't know how

77
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:21,350
it's gonna go because like i'm like first when i first
looked at it i was like this seems pretty hard to balance

78
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:27,970
because i'm like i don't know if this is unbalanced or not
like i can see some teams that felt like maybe you swap a

79
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:37,170
play like one or two Maybe it'll be better, but like, it's
so hard to balance because 80%, I think like 70% of the

80
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:50,550
players, okay, it's 1% tank players, if I'm being honest,
it's 1% tank players, 70% support players, and the rest are

81
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:58,810
DPS, and that is already very hard to balance if you have
that percentage of, yeah, the 1%...

82
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,340
You guys are gonna know how good it is because like a lot of
people are gonna be off rolling right now like for this

83
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:13,120
tournament Um Um, Ultron is fucking bad right now guys.

84
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,380
Ultron's bad Like it's all about Gambit.

85
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,860
It's all about whoever it's all If my team can play dive we
would fucking roll everyone.

86
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:29,280
That's all I'm gonna say Like If my team The thing is I
don't know if my team can play dive I don't know like

87
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:47,000
um it's either dive or mag um but i haven't even tried out
the new season you know i don't know so um um that's why i'm

88
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,920
like i'm so nervous like i i hate being so i was like so
excited to be of the, you know, the VTuber cup, but I'm

89
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:04,220
also, like, really, really nervous, because you know, I
don't, that's why I don't want to be captain.

90
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,640
Because there's so much uncertainty.

91
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,780
So I feel weird being captain, because I'm like, I don't
know.

92
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,000
This is, this is, I don't know.

93
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:30,600
I think there's is like just from my experience looking at
like knowing the gameplay of some of these players on here

94
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:38,500
and like knowing like their skill level i feel like there is
one team i know which team's gonna be first place it's not

95
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:47,420
my team but other than that like that's the only team i know
that's gonna be first place because they have a one above

96
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:55,680
all dps player um and that's the thing so hard to balance
because like the only other one above all player is me but

97
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,200
also i haven't i'm support

98
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:13,260
it's so it's like it's so scary because it's like what can i
do they play if they they play sidelock what can i do like i

99
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:22,300
can't solo a one above all sidelock player like I'm just,
I'm just a little guy.

100
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,800
I mean, maybe with Gambit, but like I said, I haven't even
played the new season yet.

101
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,940
Yeah, I'm just going to heal real hard.

102
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,000
No, you can't, no, no.

103
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:46,540
I will say it's easier to solo carry on DPS as in Marble
Rivals than it is in Overwatch.

104
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,980
In Overwatch, a lot of characters are more like, it's very
hard to solo carry.

105
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,060
Like back then in Overwatch, you can solo carry a game
easily.

106
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,040
Like you can just play Widowmaker and hit like, like kill
four people and then you win.

107
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,840
But now it's not.

108
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,660
Now it's a lot harder because all the tanks have 5,000 HP.

109
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,220
So it's a lot harder now.

110
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,380
Yeah, back then you can do like, you know, you can do
Nanoblade and then bam, easy.

111
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,660
Or like Bayblade with Reaper and a Nano boost.

112
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:24,640
not like that even even if you have a mercy pocket it's not
that easy anymore in overwatch in rivals however it is very

113
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:35,480
easy to solo carry as a dps all the way to celestial maybe
even eternity honestly to eternity it's so easy if you have

114
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:43,820
one pocket support on um and just gives you a snowflake or
even a mantis damage boost or anything you can solo carry as

115
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:52,960
a dps all the way to eternity um it's just that like it's
like um as someone that has played this is is like honestly

116
00:13:52,960 --> 00:14:01,900
like very easy to do now um especially because the reason
why um that's not solo yet but it's still it's okay duo

117
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,140
maybe but you can still do it if you don't even have a
pocket you still do it without the pocket you just need to

118
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:11,120
know a good players will know where all the health packs are
located and because they know where all the health packs are

119
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,740
located um they don't have to have a pocket support as long
as they can know where the health packs are they can easily

120
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:26,100
like as like flankers or uh maybe even hella honestly like i
had games where i was like you know you guys have seen it

121
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:35,700
before where i would play hella and then i'd be in like
fucking plat or gold elo and i don't play hella a lot and

122
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,780
this is a long time ago and i was like playing hella and i
literally like just killed pop pop pop headshot headshot

123
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:51,040
everyone's dead we go in like doesn't matter just take care
of the people that don't position very well and then just go

124
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:59,960
pop pop headshot do headshots they're dead and that's like
yeah so like you can just click heads and and yeah it's just

125
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,240
point and click that's the thing that's what I'm most
nervous like worried about most nervous but I'm trying to be

126
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,000
like it's okay just come down Doki it's it's for fun I just
don't want to be captain

127
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,980
I don't want the responsibility of being captain.

128
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,520
But the thing is, I'm also a support player.

129
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,660
I don't really want to off-roll.

130
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,220
I'm not here to off-roll, too.

131
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,600
I just want to play support.

132
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,560
That's really it.

133
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,520
So, I don't know.

134
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:29,940
I don't know.

135
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,820
I think the teams are honestly going to say the same.

136
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,900
I think at best, if I could, just like, I just don't want
the name of CAF.

137
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,880
I just don't want the title.

138
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,440
Like, you know, if we get last place, at least they won't be
like Dokeybird.

139
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,320
Like, Team Dokeybird in fourth place.

140
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,880
Because I'd rather just like, I would be on a team that's
last place, but please don't call my name out.

141
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:03,940
Like, just don't call my name out.

142
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,200
Like, bro, come on.

143
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,980
It's just a title.

144
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,880
Come on.

145
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,960
I didn't even know I was going to be captain.

146
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,760
You know what?

147
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,800
I just found out I was going to be captain.

148
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,720
Like, like, an hour ago!

149
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,380
I just, yeah, I just, I just don't like it.

150
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,180
It's just more like PTSD and trauma for me.

151
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,400
I just, I don't know.

152
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,900
It's just like, it's just like PTSD, I guess.

153
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,720
Like, I just don't like it.

154
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,120
It just gives me like, oh.

155
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,980
As our team has fun, it shouldn't matter, right?

156
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,300
The thing is, you can, I know, like, people are like,
sometimes guys have fun but marva rivals is a hero shooter

157
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:54,840
and like if one team is like a lot weaker than the other i
don't know if this is balanced i can't tell so like i'm like

158
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:01,620
i believe i believe in the balancing team because this is
very hard to balance me looking at the me looking at the

159
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:09,760
roles and um looking at the roles of what they have to you
know work with it is definitely very hard to balance so i

160
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:20,680
can understand like if they've been like trying to struggle
trying to fucking find like um the best way to do this um

161
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:29,600
and uh but yeah no like if there is a huge difference in
skill level between teams obviously you can't really have

162
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:36,600
fun if you're getting spawn camps someone said so like
that's why like you know i'm glad i don't i'm not like you

163
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:46,780
know having to uh do this because like i even like i'm like
being like i don't know this is balanced i send my email but

164
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:52,720
like um um if anything is it possible i'm just not the
captain like

165
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:03,240
um uh and it's just like even i don't know because it's it's
like i'm i'm like how do you balance

166
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:17,060
getting no if you no okay you know what's the most tilting
thing getting killed by the same person five times in a row

167
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:25,440
i don't want my team to feel that i i don't want my team to
feel that you know like being killed by the same type person

168
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,840
five plus times in a row that's not fun

169
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:45,960
so like and i feel bad you know the thing i feel bad about
is that um the thing that i feel the most bad about is that

170
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,780
obviously they're like oh joki you've been top 500 before
but that was like you know i even wrote like it was the

171
00:18:51,780 --> 00:19:01,520
early season like season zero to one i've been top 500
before and it's because of that peak that i like pull up my

172
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:09,180
team's average because of it so they have to find weaker you
know lower ranked teammates to balance it out so i i feel

173
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:14,300
really bad because all i can do is play support I don't even
care like they're like people and when I play ranked it'd be

174
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:23,400
like you play anything else and I'd be like no like no you
swap like you know I'm stubborn I don't fucking want to play

175
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:34,540
anything else like so like I haven't even touched the other
roles in a very long time so I'm like I don't care I'm just

176
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,600
gonna I'm still gonna play support I'll be like and then
they'll be like, oh, can you play tank?

177
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,220
I have zero hours in tank.

178
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,120
I can just say that.

179
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,980
And then they're like, okay, well, okay.

180
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,590
I yeah.

181
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,970
Yeah, I have fun with support.

182
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:52,450
I do.

183
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,150
I enjoy.

184
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,070
I enjoy playing support in Rivals.

185
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,970
So, yeah, I'm just nervous.

186
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,530
I'm really nervous about this event.

187
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,550
Ah, ah.

188
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,810
I'm nervous.

189
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:08,850
I really am.

190
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:17,090
Um, uh, okay, wait, give me a sec, let me, oh, I don't mind
if it's anyone in my team.

191
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,680
All right, here we go.

192
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,500
All right, um, no, I don't want to flex.

193
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:50,840
Because the thing is, when you're flexing, it has to be on
tank, and I don't fuck with that.

194
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,020
It's never DPS.

195
00:20:53,380 --> 00:21:01,260
You can never flex on DPS, because there's like, like, 200
plus dps players like on my team it's never when you're

196
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:10,280
flexing it's never dps it's tank i don't want that i will
never be a tank player you can never get that out of me also

197
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:19,620
am i lagging a little bit with my fluid i can't tell i never
yeah it's never a dps flex you know it also for those who

198
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:28,060
don't know we didn't get nominated for uh marvel rival
streamer um i did cry a little i did a bit when because like

199
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:36,440
I I stayed I like uh my managers like do work I was like no
I'm watching them announce the nomination and then I got I

200
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:45,020
was like ha ha I was so confident you know I was like oh my
gosh silly dokey never go in with high expectations never go

201
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:53,080
in with high expectations dokey and then um I was so I was
like hopeful and confident because I was like truly I'd get

202
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:59,340
nominated right I was like I don't know I don't know why I
thought I'd get a nominated uh that I was like getting ready

203
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:05,140
to screenshot it on my phone as well because I was like I
can't get work done uh to my manager because I was like I'm

204
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:10,640
too busy like I have to know like it was like one hour
before the stream and it had to wait like 40 minutes while

205
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:18,520
in the start like I forgot that flesh tubers um when not
even flesh to but I think like twitch streamers for twitch

206
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:28,220
streamers I'm so used to just like going live after my intro
like I loop like two to three loops and then I swap.

207
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,200
and, you know, like, even then I was like, oh, your guys are
waiting too long in the waiting, like, waiting screen.

208
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:43,780
But I forgot that, like, not just Fleshdures, but, like,
Twitch streamers, their waiting stream can be, like, an hour

209
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,200
long before the actual stream.

210
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,860
Like, I forgot people do that on Twitch.

211
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,920
Not just, like I said, I've seen YouTubers do it, too.

212
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,760
They would, like, you know, they want people to gather in
first.

213
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:01,700
But I would, like, you know, the stream started I waited I
think like 40 plus minutes like 40 plus minutes before they

214
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:07,840
started the stream um like because it was like starting
stream you know the intro stream like the waiting like the

215
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:14,800
starting stream title thing and then I waited 40 minutes and
then they uh and then they started announcing the nomination

216
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:23,360
so I was obviously so antsy and everything um and so like
you know I got I was like I got my phone ready to screenshot

217
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:33,920
it And then I was like after the fifth name called I knew I
wasn't gonna be in it After I heard the fifth name I was

218
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:42,920
like I no I didn't make it So then I obviously I started
crying because I don't know I just thought that you know

219
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:53,220
Like you know people were like oh why are you so why are you
so like um to this like oh it's just a meaningless award the

220
00:23:53,220 --> 00:24:01,880
thing is i put a lot of effort campaigning for it so like
you know and then it's like i thought it'd be really cool

221
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,680
and it'd be really nice to be like you know a vtuber
represent representative because you don't see vtubers

222
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:18,460
nominated outside of it's you barely see vtubers nominated
outside of like the vtuber category so um so that's why like

223
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:23,220
That's why I put so much, like, you know, expectations on
myself for it.

224
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,480
And I thought this was like, oh, yeah, this is like one of
the categories that VTubers have a chance to, like, shine

225
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:28,720
in.

226
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,840
Because, like, I did so much on Marvel Rivals as a VTuber.

227
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,240
And, like, Marvel sponsors me a lot.

228
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,920
And, like, sponsors me a lot for, like, their stuff.

229
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,880
And, you know, they usually just pick me on the VTuber side.

230
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,740
And it's all FleshTubers.

231
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,780
So, you know, I thought I, you know, I was like, oh, maybe
there's a possibility.

232
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,600
There's a chance.

233
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,060
and so that's why like you know i thought it'd be really
cool i was like oh that'd be such good like representation

234
00:24:54,060 --> 00:25:00,460
you know be like look see a vtuber can like get on this
category as well like outside of the vtuber category because

235
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:06,080
it doesn't happen very often like um i know like iron mouse
she has got nominated various things outside of either

236
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:13,440
category and it puts a lot of exposure to vtubers in general
because you know it's a normie lots of normies watch this

237
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,020
like the people that are nominated also like it's the meta
for streaming changed so much it's mostly rl streaming it's

238
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:28,880
crazy um but like like you know it's also like you know a
lot of normies and like you know um watch the streamer

239
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,520
awards and like like especially like the streamers that can
nominate in these awards so it's like really good publicity

240
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:40,360
in general um so that's why you know i felt really bad i
felt really sad because i was like oh i can't believe i can

241
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:49,440
i was like oh my god i should oh like you know i was like oh
why did i thought i could do it like because I know a lot of

242
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,460
it's not your guys fault.

243
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,580
I just think that you know youtubers are still um a niche.

244
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:02,720
It's like a huge niche and honestly I feel like it's more so
like oh it's not because like okay that's what pissed me off

245
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,220
the most.

246
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:10,760
What the thing was pissing me off the most was that people
on my tweets you know of course you know all my tweets being

247
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:16,120
like my community didn't show up or like your community just
didn't vote for you and I was like that's a fucking lie.

248
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:25,280
I know so many And I know a lot of like VTubers from
different A lot of VTubers outside of my circle were saying

249
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:30,860
No vote for Doki Bird for Marvel Rivals So I was like
there's It's not my community not showing up It's not like

250
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:40,220
even the VTuber like The VTuber community even voted for me
In Marvel Rivals Like it wasn't just my community too So

251
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:50,480
it's just because this is my theory It's just that Because I
am not part of like i'm not like a normie streamer and we're

252
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,420
like vtubers you know like it's a it's still niche we're
still very niche we're part of a niche group within a niche

253
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:02,220
group because we're part of the anime group but anime is
already pretty niche and then within the and the thing is

254
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:10,120
like a lot of these uh normie streamers like normie viewers
viewers they'll be like i don't know anyone in marvel rivals

255
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,580
but hey this guy i've seen this guy play this game once and
he collabs with um the streamer

256
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:25,860
so I'm gonna vote for him I think it's just that like
they're just like you know they're voting for their favorite

257
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:32,180
norm like they're voting for their favorite blush tuber in
the categories and they got to the Marvel rival categories

258
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:40,140
and they'll be like I remember this oh yeah this guy this
guy played with um this guy played with my favorite streamer

259
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:46,060
one time and it was Marvel Rivals or like and I don't
remember he's she's Marvel Rivals I'm gonna vote for him too

260
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:51,660
like I don't know what he actually does but I'm gonna vote
for him because you know he he's like my favorite streamer's

261
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:58,980
friend or like he he uh he's collabed with my favorite
streamer and uh he uh he does I remember him seeing him

262
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:09,120
stream Marvel Ravos so it's just that and and it's just like
you know but obviously I don't know a lot of flesh tubers uh

263
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:17,180
so obviously like and like flesh like a lot of flesh tuber
viewers a lot of normies they don't really watch vtubers so

264
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:22,540
it's just basically that i just think i just don't have the
reach and i don't stream on twitch that often too i know a

265
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:28,100
lot of people are like oh you should do multi-streaming now
you know like hollow dive is doing multi-streaming now um

266
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:39,360
but like i feel so okay i don't know i know like i'm like
i'm like um stagnating my growth by not streaming on twitch

267
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:52,320
um I know that I know I'm stagnating my growth by being so
stubborn and splitting you know like doing Twitch as an

268
00:28:52,320 --> 00:29:03,140
afterthought and for like extra bonus streams but like I
hate the chat restrictions I hate it so much and like I saw

269
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:12,400
like apparently also the fucking rules are so um unclear
because I saw like I saw someone I don't remember who it was

270
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,440
it was a while ago that was like trying to warn the hollow
live girls being like don't keep your don't keep two twitch

271
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,820
chat don't keep YouTube and twitch chat on the stream or
like you could get banned but apparently the rules are so

272
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:34,260
unclear and so poorly written you can apparently have both
twitch chat streams on like both chats on your screen but

273
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:41,260
they have to be divided like I don't know like they gotta be
segregated like They cannot touch.

274
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,260
It's crazy.

275
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,440
So you can have both chats.

276
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,840
They just can't touch.

277
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,220
They have to be on opposite sides of the screen.

278
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,280
Yeah, it's fucking weird.

279
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,060
I...

280
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,760
Like, yeah.

281
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,420
So, you have to have...

282
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,860
And they can't be, like, you know, like a little space
between them.

283
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,600
It has to be actually, like, on the other side.

284
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,460
Like...

285
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:21,820
it's so so because everyone thought that you can't have
youtube chat on if you're doing multi-streaming on twitch

286
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:29,740
but apparently the rules are so because that was like
everyone would parrot that like everyone was parrots it and

287
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:38,920
was like yeah um you can't have like you can't have them
like the screen you only can only have twitch chat because

288
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:45,980
like twitch will ban you if you have youtube chat on the
screen because that's how vague the rules are that's how

289
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:58,060
vague it is and um uh and then i found like we found out
later that no no you can't you can't have both chats they

290
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:08,320
just can't be together they just have to be like very
clearly separated um so that uh you can't have them there

291
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,700
also someone was like oh what about there's some streamers
that have them merged those streamers have a contract with

292
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:22,480
twitch that allows them to do that um because they don't
want them to leave their platform so they they have a

293
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:34,980
contract where they can merge their chats um but they're
very contract uh so um so there are some creators on twitch

294
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,700
that can merge it but if you aren't like you know you're not
one of those creators that have that contract obviously you

295
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:46,840
can't do it um it's you know it's makes sense because like
you don't want the streamer with 30 000 viewers leave your

296
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:58,500
platform like like you want it to go to your competitor like
no it's not just chat it's more so of like you know in the

297
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:04,460
contractors a lot of like stipulations and a lot of like
rules that you can bypass because you're like oh i want if

298
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:10,140
you want me on your platform um you want me to stream on
your platform like i'll do this and i would like this and

299
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:16,260
this and this um because like i say i that's the one reason
why i don't want to multi-stream because it's like it's ugly

300
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:27,740
i don't want to have both chats on opposite sides of the
screen it's so i would be like okay i mean if i could tiny

301
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:34,520
like you know the youtube chat is here and then the twitch
chat is like right under there like that's fine i'm fine

302
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:42,100
with that but the fact that i do two different chats on like
different it's just it's screen color i hate screen color i

303
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,820
just hate it like it just doesn't look good

304
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:57,600
no it has to you have to be like like very clearly separated
and every thing.

305
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,780
Um, I just, oh, that's what I hate.

306
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,340
That's what I hate.

307
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:08,000
I just like, they have to be like here and then the other
one will have to be like very clearly not touching each

308
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,200
other.

309
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,500
And I just, oh, it pisses me off.

310
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:16,160
Uh, there are a lot of years that do what you just said.

311
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,600
It's not allowed though.

312
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,920
It's not, I was reading that thread.

313
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:31,900
I won't say it, but like, no snitching, no snitching And
people were saying, it's just, it's just more so like, as

314
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:41,520
long as Twitch doesn't do anything to you, um, if one is
going up and one is going, they can't touch as one is going

315
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,780
up and one is going down, those are so fucking unclear.

316
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:54,060
I was reading the Twitter thread and I was looking at, like,
hololive, and they didn't want to, like, get in trouble.

317
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,000
So they separated it in two different sides.

318
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:04,900
um it's not so i was reading a thread and people were saying
it's not supposed they can't touch people were saying that

319
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:13,880
too and like that's what i'm saying it's so unclear it's so
fucking unclear because like the um the like and i know like

320
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,080
you know i don't want to fuck with twitch

321
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:31,340
they're so unclear i feel like the rules need to be more
clarified because i was reading the um and like people were

322
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:36,340
saying that like yeah like they're not supposed to touch and
i'm like okay

323
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:52,000
but like even before then even before then it was like
common knowledge where like twitch was like you can't you

324
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:02,460
can't have youtube chat on stream on screen like i was like
uh that's what they I just don't like having two chats on my

325
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,560
screen because of the clutter.

326
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,060
It's just, it already covers so much, you know?

327
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,220
I play video games.

328
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,960
I do a lot of gaming streams.

329
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:15,660
And like, the thing is, I try to minimize as much clutter as
possible.

330
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:22,960
And I don't like that, like, I don't like the fact that, you
know, like the chat can, having two chats can cover a lot,

331
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,960
up a lot of stuff.

332
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:24,600
Yeah.

333
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,680
One chat is fun.

334
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:35,860
It covers a lot of stuff that's on the screen when I already
have myself on screen as well.

335
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:41,440
Like, no, it's just because, like, you know, that's what
also is really hard about being a VTuber streamer.

336
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:47,740
It's because if you're doing like, if you're a Flesh
Trooper, you can just shrink your, you can just shrink your

337
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,280
cam and stuff.

338
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,680
But like, you know, a lot of people like watching VTuber
streamers for the VTuber on the screen.

339
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:59,360
And then that's already covering up like one fourth of the
game.

340
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:15,920
and and then it's like oh yeah it's just uh just shrink
yourself like what's the point i might as well not be on

341
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:25,420
screen it's like those like i shrink myself and i'm like
those like interpreter like the hand sign interpreter people

342
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:31,560
are like right on the bottom this will Just streak myself.

343
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,940
I'd be like, like the interpreter.

344
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,900
I'm doing my hand signs.

345
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,780
And doing like, oh, this is what she's saying.

346
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,080
Yeah, ASL Doki right here.

347
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,180
But yeah, I know I should multi-stream.

348
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,960
I know.

349
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,140
I just, I don't know.

350
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,260
I should suck up my integrity and pride.

351
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,660
I just wish the rules aren't so unclear.

352
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,200
Because it's like...

353
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,380
Now I'm finding out that apparently you can have...

354
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,220
Both chats touch each other.

355
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,960
But like, people were like arguing against that.

356
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,940
I was reading it up.

357
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,500
I was like, oh...

358
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,380
Because he can't look like it's merged.

359
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,540
So...

360
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,840
So it's like...

361
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,400
What if...

362
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,280
Like, are these rules that are actually like...

363
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,200
If Twitch doesn't like you, they'll give you like a
suspension?

364
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,560
Like, stuff like that.

365
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,280
Like, I...

366
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,360
You know, okay, someone...

367
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,180
Okay, someone earlier was saying that

368
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:50,360
Someone earlier When I streamed on Twitch They were saying
That like Oh Jokey, you changed the description on your

369
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:55,660
Twitch Because in my old description I was like, I stream on
YouTube more, follow me there And then when I found out Hala

370
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:04,980
I was doing multi-streams on Twitch Or like not multi-stream
was joining Twitch guidelines um this is the same day i saw

371
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:10,680
someone tweeting out like trying to warn the hollow girls
being like don't merge your chats or anything or don't have

372
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:18,340
both chats on screen because that's against the rules which
apparently isn't anymore like what the fuck like why are the

373
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:29,240
rules so unclear like so then i reread the rules again um i
reread the rules and um and then i found out You're not

374
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,380
supposed to advertise a different platform to encourage
viewers to come to that platform And I realized I've been

375
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:39,520
breaking the rules for a very long time So I quickly changed
it That

376
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:51,210
was the day I changed the description Because in there it
was like You're not supposed to encourage other your viewers

377
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,810
to come follow you on it

378
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:06,370
I quickly changed it because I was like oh fuck okay I No,
and you didn't get punished for it.

379
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:16,570
I think I sort of did because one of the twitch staff
unfriended me on discord and unfollowed me on Twitter Pretty

380
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,770
straight they're just like I don't want to deal with you.

381
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:19,930
I

382
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:28,770
So yeah Well, that was a long time ago.

383
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:37,770
No, it was before it was before like yeah it was it was a
while ago i just didn't realize it until like a couple like

384
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:44,050
a month or two ago i realized it because like my manager
asked me something about like oh you have a twitch staff i

385
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:50,410
could message about something and i was like yeah let me
look up and i was like wait i can't find them um my discord

386
00:39:50,410 --> 00:40:01,310
friends list so so um no no they're still working there i
think i saw their twitter so i was just like oh let me no

387
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:08,030
problem let me find them on my discord friends list and i
was like wait they're not my friends list anymore and i was

388
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:14,070
like wait are you still following me on twitter i was like
oh they're not following me on twitter anymore so i was like

389
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:38,450
um that's awkward um i was like well i found their discord
handle but um they removed me on anything so um good good

390
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:48,670
luck um next seat thank you for the super chat thank you
thank you for what it's worth i do appreciate you just

391
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:55,350
stream on youtube it's comfy but i won't blame you decide to
dual stream i don't know i don't know i just i don't like um

392
00:40:55,350 --> 00:41:02,850
i personally just i'm not a fan of dual streaming but it i'm
stagnating my growth by not full streaming because like i

393
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:14,670
said you know twitch is for any like english-speaking
streamers um youtube is more for um for like um you know for

394
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:25,650
live streams it's more of gear towards asia um twitch is for
eu and na and youtube is for bots like it's for video

395
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,270
Uploads, short form content.

396
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,610
It's not really for live.

397
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,370
Oh my god.

398
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:29,710
Okay.

399
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:37,870
So I was talking to Moxie and he was like, oh, he was like
checking, he's like sharing screen with me.

400
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:42,190
And he's like, I was like, yeah, no, I, she's like, oh, you
don't, I don't see it on Twitch often.

401
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,890
I was like, no, I do my streams on YouTube.

402
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:49,090
And then he like went on YouTube, well onto my channel and
was like, you don't have a lot of uploads.

403
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,510
I was like, no, you fucker.

404
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,090
It's on Click Live.

405
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:52,670
And he's

406
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:57,830
That's a tab?

407
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,650
I was like, oh my God, you fucking...

408
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,150
Because, you know, you go straight to videos.

409
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,110
Because, like, that's what people normally do.

410
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,410
And it's like, wait, what?

411
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:11,010
There is a tab called for live?

412
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,050
And I'm like, live?

413
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,070
I'm like, yes, you fuck?

414
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,330
Like, what the fuck?

415
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,850
That's my main platform.

416
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,570
Yeah, a lot of people don't know about YouTube live.

417
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,510
Mine is fucking blown.

418
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:29,570
yeah like

419
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:40,650
so so that it's a lot of people that don't know that a lot
especially a lot of normies that don't know that there is a

420
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:59,930
live tab on on youtube um so so that's why i know i'm i know
i'm not like i'm stunting my growth but i I hate it I hate

421
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:10,150
it I hate the new meta is multi streaming Because people are
like People you know are like You are You are not fucking

422
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:18,790
over your career You are more so like You are not taking
advantage Of the things Like the materials in front of you

423
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:26,170
By By not multi streaming And it's like Ah I hate splitting
viewerships too.

424
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,070
I hate it.

425
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:29,170
I hate it so much.

426
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:36,850
Um, I just want, you know, I just don't want to split
viewerships too.

427
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:40,870
I just want everyone to be here with me in one area.

428
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,210
No, I am a meta slave, though.

429
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,070
That's the worst part.

430
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:48,070
I'm a meta slave.

431
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:50,190
Uh, let's see.

432
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,910
There is a fundamental brand where there's people at brand
loyalty.

433
00:43:54,410 --> 00:44:00,530
is about the only noticeable difference magic thank you
super chat thank you thank you thank you thank you uh crunch

434
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:05,350
thank you the super chat thank you thank you thank you uh
you're my favorite marvel i streamer you inspired me as i've

435
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:10,350
been in emotional slump and my room is cluttered i took your
advice and started it day by day thank you thank you thank

436
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:16,930
you i'm happy that you know you're taking the steps to uh
feel better about yourself it really does mean a lot uh to

437
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:25,970
help you with that um but yeah no like i said uh to go back
with the whole marvel i was saying i I mentioned I hated

438
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:31,670
that like like you know the randoms were like you know
blaming you guys it was fucking pissed me off like I didn't

439
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:37,170
care I like after the you know not knowing knowing that I
didn't get nominated I literally played fortnight through

440
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:45,910
two hours later like I I was okay you know I was sad you
know as I should be because like um I did spend a lot of

441
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:55,770
time campaigning um I spent a lot of time campaigning and I
also did bonus streams late at night um you know when i was

442
00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:06,910
already so busy i was already so busy and i did do bonus
rival streams late at night so it wasn't like i didn't try i

443
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:14,650
think i felt like i did try and um so obviously you know
that's why people are like why are you so sad about this

444
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:21,370
meaningless award why are you like because i put so much
time and effort even though you guys might some of you guys

445
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:31,490
might think it's i still put effort into trying to campaign
so it you know in my in my head i feel like oh i've wasted

446
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:45,570
so much time i could have if i knew like you know it wasn't
possible i wouldn't have you took that time you know like so

447
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:53,710
that's why i didn't think you i personally didn't think it's
meaningless i thought like you know um it was it would have

448
00:45:53,710 --> 00:46:02,190
been nice to you know be able to have a vtuber outside of
the vtuber category um in one of those spots um and then

449
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:13,810
okay another thing that i felt like i was getting rage
baited um was that um like we were like oh someone was like

450
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:23,350
you didn't even tweet about it that's a fucking lie someone
that was following me i i held my tongue was like i looked

451
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:26,890
at her twitter and she didn't even tweet tweet about asking
for a vote.

452
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:35,270
If anything, my tweet had the most likes out of all the
nominees that asked for a vote.

453
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:38,030
So don't fuck with me.

454
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:44,030
Because VTuber fans love Twitter.

455
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:47,150
They love interacting with Twitter.

456
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,150
Normies, for some reason, don't.

457
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:59,990
I was like, Normies don't interact with Twitter, but VTuber
fans fucking love interacting with Twitter.

458
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,650
Don't fuck with me.

459
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:17,570
Yeah, like, and then someone else that, that, um, yeah,
because we're chronically online, because that's how we

460
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:20,830
fucking were able to interact with our favorite anime
person.

461
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:31,870
Maybe they'll go out the street and be like, oh my god,
there's there's Kai Senat walking in Target You can catch

462
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:40,970
them, but you know how only we can see our favorite anime
girl or boy online So we have to be chronically online Like

463
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:51,350
You can look outside and then you'd be like, oh my god,
there's speed doing his running shit I don't fucking know

464
00:47:51,350 --> 00:48:13,350
Like and then um and then another thing another thing that
um um that like fucked with rage baited me but i but i had

465
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:19,190
to say it because i was like i know i'm like oh i'm fine i'm
like after that but i had to talk about it was that uh i

466
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:24,610
remember reading not even just one person multiple people
were like oh it's just because you didn't stream enough of

467
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:31,370
arrivals all the other nominees um um trained more than you
and i was just like okay

468
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:45,590
and then i was like don't oh don't pull that card if
anything half the nominees streamed it when they were

469
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,370
sponsored don't Fuck with me.

470
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:51,590
Like, and, like, I don't say half.

471
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:53,590
Maybe, like, like, one or two.

472
00:48:54,030 --> 00:49:03,210
And then, like, I know, like, one, another one, they, like,
basically, they, like, um, they, they stream it.

473
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:05,510
They do stream it, but they don't, like, stream it.

474
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:06,590
They are variety.

475
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,770
One or two of them are just variety.

476
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:10,990
And Rivals is their variety stream.

477
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:12,970
You know who else does that?

478
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:29,770
I'm considered a variety streamer, but I do stream rivals a
lot as well I even play rivals off stream so I was like you

479
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:39,290
cannot so like I'm just like oh my god like when I saw like
several people's commenting that I was like no you do no

480
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:49,670
that no me being a variety streamer doesn't fucking put me
out of the running because I still consistently stream

481
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:52,410
rivals outside of being sponsored.

482
00:49:54,750 --> 00:50:03,110
But they're like implying that like the nominees weren't
also variety streamers?

483
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:10,710
Like I was like, if anything I think Bougar's the only pure
rival streamer in the nominations.

484
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:23,610
So I was just like, I was just like, no, no, no, no, no.

485
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:33,770
I'm pretty sure like three of them have the same consistency
as me in terms of like variety and streaming rivals.

486
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:45,440
So that's why I was just like, um that's why i was like you
can't use that argument for me

487
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:57,570
i even play off stream like i'm just like bro i that's how
i'm like bro i'm so i'm in so deep i play off stream like

488
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:07,530
have you ever seen tim play off stream bro he has a family
to take care of he's not fucked up like me like

489
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:20,430
he has a life outside like he ain't fucked up like me I play
off I play rivals at three in the morning off stream I ain't

490
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:31,030
here to make content out of it I actually just purely enjoy
the game like I purely enjoy the game so much that I will

491
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:36,470
not sleep to play rivals at three in the morning I have a
problem please understand like

492
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:42,050
He's very healthy.

493
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,450
Yo, I had so many people.

494
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:49,170
I bumped into...

495
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:53,270
While I was playing off stream, not at a degenerate hour.

496
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:55,570
Actually, at like, you know, 12 p.m.

497
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:56,330
or some shit.

498
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,010
Like, 12 or 1 p.m.

499
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:59,870
I bumped into...

500
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:00,970
What's his name?

501
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:01,970
The org that left.

502
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:05,090
By the way, 100 Thieves left the Marvel Rivals.

503
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:06,810
Didn't leave the Marvel Rivals.

504
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:10,690
For those who do follow Esports, 100 Thieves didn't leave
the Marvel Rivals scene.

505
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:16,890
They're just they just didn't want to pay I think they just
didn't want to play paid a roster before the new league was

506
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:26,070
announced because if they still have Here's a little like
esport like knowledge for you guys like business knowledge

507
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:37,130
like Net ease slash rivals haven't announced the new league
yet but there's no tournaments until 2026

508
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:50,590
because that's you know they're all losing money you know
like majority of esports orgs aren't making money um and you

509
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:59,750
know you know they don't want to pay their teams it's you
know they have to pay them monthly you know so it's easier

510
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:10,130
to not to kick you know to drop their team and wait until
the 2026 league is announced and then recruit a new team

511
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:24,250
because that's at least four months of not paying wages like
so so that's why that's why they drop their team because why

512
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:30,510
the fuck would they pay their the roster money when there's
no tournaments to enter like

513
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:44,690
it's messed up but esport orgs are not making money like
except for like that one percent i think the only i'm pretty

514
00:53:44,690 --> 00:54:01,150
sure um the the the only esport org that i'm very confident
in that is making actual profit is t1 purely off of faker

515
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:09,450
that's it purely off of faker that's the only for org that
full confidence is making actual income and

516
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:27,990
nothing else i feel like i feel like i feel like t was the
only org um um so yeah so anyway back to my story uh back to

517
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:35,130
my story uh i was like 12 to 1 p.m and

518
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:51,230
Let's see.

519
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:52,550
Oh, yeah, I'm not captain.

520
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,150
Thank fucking God.

521
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,530
Yeah, I don't get to be captain.

522
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,830
Sorry, no, I just got the message.

523
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:03,970
They're like, you don't have to be captain.

524
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:04,630
Look, thank God.

525
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:05,330
I don't.

526
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:06,670
Yay.

527
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,530
They're like, oh, it'd be more publicity if you're like team
Doki brand.

528
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:20,590
I don't care Me already being in that team everyone knows
who I am I don't need to be like you don't have to like push

529
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:25,930
my name out there Like anyone that's watching for a mob
arrivals already knows my name.

530
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:33,030
It's fine Like I'm that much of a degenerate for this game
like on the VTuber side.

531
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:39,110
I think everyone's aware Yay dodging your responsibility

532
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:53,910
Yeah, I just don't want them to be like, oh, Team Doki
Braid, Lost, I just don't want people to say that, like,

533
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:02,870
I'm just, I'm just here for the ride, I don't want to be on
the driver, I don't want to be the driver's seat, um,

534
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:15,450
anyway, um, my, my story, my story, basically, um, Uh, uh,
so I bumped into, who is it?

535
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:18,050
Delena.

536
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:21,630
Sorry, I was like, do I remember the name?

537
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:23,610
I was like, one of the PS players.

538
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:26,390
It was like, is I heard Delena or Terra?

539
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,770
But I remember it was Delena.

540
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:31,690
Um, because he's the, uh, because I remember it was Delena.

541
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:34,450
Anyway, I bumped into Delena in rank.

542
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:36,330
Also, me, thank you for the 20 gift of ships.

543
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:36,690
Thank you.

544
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:37,310
Thank you.

545
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:45,150
I was like, oh, oh, and then Delena, I pulled up his stream.

546
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,930
He's part of 100 Thieves.

547
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:53,970
For those who don't follow Esports, he is part of 100
Thieves, and they are known as the best team in NA, but they

548
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:54,450
got fourth.

549
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:55,910
Was it third?

550
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:59,030
Or it was, was it third or fourth?

551
00:56:59,170 --> 00:56:59,690
I don't remember.

552
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:04,550
They are the best team in NA, but, you know, EU fucked NA
hard.

553
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:08,730
So, doesn't matter because EU fucked NA.

554
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:18,610
It wasn't even like a challenge to that's the worst part
like you was so ahead of NA Like it was not even it was so

555
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:18,990
sad.

556
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:37,550
It wasn't even a goddamn challenge like It was just 3-0 done
like Sorry All right, oh fly quest was the okay, but under

557
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:40,330
these one first in the NA tournament.

558
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:43,050
But in the world, Land, they were fourth place.

559
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:45,290
Flyer Quest got third because Meta favored them.

560
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:49,950
Because the thing is, for those who don't follow Marvel
Rivals meta, I'm sorry, I'm info dumping you guys so hard.

561
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:54,650
People are like, I don't care about Marvel Rivals, but this
entire stream was one hour of me talking about Marvel

562
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:55,050
Rivals.

563
00:57:55,850 --> 00:58:04,230
But basically, the thing is, after the NA tournament, meta,
like, they had to play on the new season patch.

564
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:15,470
So because of they had to play on the new season patch, the
from the NA tournament fully shifted in the world tournament

565
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:27,330
so and they only had I think like one month to prep for the
new meta so like you know that's not a lot of time so they

566
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:36,010
had one month to learn the entirely new meta I think was
less than that was it like only three weeks it was like two

567
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:42,030
to three weeks maybe yeah it was like two to three three
weeks between not even one month it was like two to three

568
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:49,790
weeks to learn an entire new meta with a new with some new
hero pools maybe like not you know your tanks or dps or

569
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:58,710
supports not their strongest hero pools um going into the
one million dollar land um because how's that different than

570
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:06,030
the others because it may dive a lot stronger the new meta
may dive so fucking strong because for those who don't know

571
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:16,790
the new meta was that they buffed venom for those who forgot
they heavily buffed majority of the dive characters and they

572
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:27,590
released daredevil so na has been practicing non-dive for
the entire time but in eu they've always been playing dive

573
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:35,870
so it for them there was like you know it's nothing changed
for them in general so in na they all don't know how to

574
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:46,110
learn dive in time in two to three weeks going in to a one
million dollar land and the best venom players in the world

575
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:56,090
are all eu players that's the thing europe all the best
captain america the best venom player the best angelo player

576
00:59:56,090 --> 01:00:01,630
were all europeans We're the European pros.

577
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:10,090
So I would say the best non-dive kit, the best, you know,
the stationary tanks, you know, the best mag, the best

578
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:13,710
strange, the best Emma, those were NA.

579
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:15,590
But that doesn't matter.

580
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:19,910
Yeah, the best Captain Europe, basically.

581
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:21,690
No, Captain Europe.

582
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:23,150
It was literally Captain Europe.

583
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:29,110
So all the best stationary tanks were NA, and all the best
dive tanks.

584
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:34,310
were European, but the one million dollar land was literally
dive.

585
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:36,430
Like it was dive meta.

586
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:41,750
So like they can't end the thing is they're like, oh, why
don't you just replace the players in time for the rosters

587
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:43,270
were locked since the beginning.

588
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:52,150
So it's not like you can poach someone for the million
dollar land because the roster is locked before the first

589
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:52,670
tournament.

590
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:54,970
It was before the first tournament even started.

591
01:00:55,210 --> 01:01:00,730
The regional tournaments, like NA tournament, European
tournament, Asia tournament, The rosters are fully locked

592
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:06,910
you can't change the roster until the end of the season
which is after the million dollar world tournament So you

593
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:13,710
know and it was pretty much fucked like It was so sad.

594
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,150
I watched the land.

595
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:16,490
I was so bored.

596
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:26,670
I'm sorry like cuz it was literally Even like the two best
European teams like it was a 3-1 during like first versus

597
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:36,830
second that was like the best dive players were all on the
first place team so i was it was literally like three one

598
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:50,050
and um and like i was just like okay it was so it was
one-sided as hell like it was not like it was like it was so

599
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:57,930
fucking one-sided there was no actual fight like you know
who's gonna win like it would be a miracle if the second

600
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:08,350
place team even put up much of a fight like the saddest part
was there was no fight there was no actual like you'll be

601
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:15,010
like fight back no they're dead like like half of them are
in a coma right now and half are like dead like

602
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:25,950
so so anyway back to my original story i'll now explain
sorry you guys needed to You guys didn't need the context of

603
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:32,810
you fucking NA hard, but like, I just wanted to tell you
guys, like, what it was like and what it might be like, too.

604
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:42,610
Um, anyway, back to my original story of, like, how much of
a degenerate I am.

605
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:53,650
Um, um, um, I bumped into Delana, who's his 100 Thieves, and
I pulled up his snow because they were streaming.

606
01:02:54,250 --> 01:03:00,570
with like another pro player but they were both solo because
you know like like i'd say it's such a weird twitch meta now

607
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:06,150
where like even though you're not streaming streaming
together like you're actually you're not like playing

608
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:13,030
together a lot of the smaller streamers they do the stream
together just so they can combine all their viewerships

609
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:20,790
together to be on the top of the twitch page in twitch
category is very smart but it fucks with commute interaction

610
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:29,210
i think it's like you get no community and you don't get a
community because you're not interacting with chat because

611
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:35,090
everybody's chat is combined so how the fuck are you gonna
read your own chat then like you know your chat has to read

612
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:43,530
everyone else's chats too so you're not building your
community but um it's not cynical because like how can you

613
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:55,090
you know how can you build your community if you don't have
your community um so um so so like The thing is, they all

614
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:56,070
combine it, too.

615
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:56,990
So I don't know why they do.

616
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:57,570
They all combine.

617
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:00,050
I think they combine it to make their chat look active.

618
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:03,990
Um, you know, because they'll be like, oh, why does it say
this much viewership?

619
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:08,330
They do it to, like, make it so their chat, um, chat looks
very active.

620
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:13,550
So, um, anyway, sorry, that's not even part of the original
story.

621
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:14,630
Anyway, bumped into Delena.

622
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:16,070
Back to the original story.

623
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:23,870
And, um, he, like, randomly, he was like, he was, I was
watching the VOD because I was like, oh, hey, Delena was on

624
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:24,230
my team.

625
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:31,950
we lost obviously um because like we had someone throwing on
our team i don't remember what was going on but you know um

626
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:39,130
i am an e-o-m um terrorist so like it like it just follows
me so at that point i'm not even like surprised that we had

627
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:49,150
someone throwing anyway um and you realize then elena try to
add me uh to invite me to play um because i've never talked

628
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:55,450
to him before um the one interaction i had was when i also
got him in a game on stream and then he started throwing.

629
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:59,690
I was like, because, but before he started throwing, sorry,
this is another tangent.

630
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:05,870
You guys might remember the story, like remember the stream,
but I got Delana in my game like a long time ago.

631
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:10,090
And, um, I was like, look guys, it's Delana from 100
Thieves.

632
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:12,570
And Delana was like, is that the real dokey bird?

633
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:13,650
And I said nothing.

634
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:16,710
And then he swapped the squirrel girl and started throwing.

635
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:19,630
And I was like, guys, I should have told him I am the real
dokey bird.

636
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:23,390
Like, I was like, guys, I fucked up.

637
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:24,230
I should have told him.

638
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:33,950
showed him so he wouldn't throw like and then I think and
then he realized I was the real bokeh bird and then he like

639
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:44,690
he like swapped back to um he swat back to like a real DPS
character uh and then that was my and then he went into my

640
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:50,550
chat and was like we should play together so now I was like
yeah sure add me and that was like four months ago so that

641
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:59,810
was like the last interaction that was the only the first
and only interaction i've had with delena anyway fast

642
01:05:59,810 --> 01:06:07,690
forward to like last week bumped into him again and then
obviously i wasn't streaming because i i play for the love

643
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:12,770
of the game not because i want to just make like you know
just not because i want to have to stream it or anything i

644
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:20,570
actually enjoy playing this game off stream um um i looked
at his chat because after the game I looked at his chat and

645
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:26,410
then I was I was afk and I came back and then I saw his chat
because I wanted to see like oh do you say anything did he

646
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:39,750
notice I was in his game and um and um in the chat they're
like oh dokeybird uh dokeybird uh what is it called what's

647
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:45,870
that lingo people use nowadays when oh don't know wall view
I was like what does that twitch lingo um they're like wow i

648
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:51,130
can't believe dokeyberg dono wild you or like yeah she
doesn't acknowledge you bro and i was like what i was so

649
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:57,050
confused i was like what the fuck i didn't do anything like
they didn't even ask you they didn't say anything to me and

650
01:06:57,050 --> 01:07:04,950
apparently um dono wild means like um they like try to talk
to you but you ignore them so like uh so they don't talk

651
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:09,610
like you don't talk to them until you don't i think it's
like they don't talk to you they're like trying to imply

652
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:16,130
that you they don't acknowledge you unless you give money to
them i think that's That means, and you know that I don't

653
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:22,310
don't know all you guys, because I'm literally interacting
with all you guys, and I don't have a super chat right now,

654
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:36,090

Anyway, so, um, what happened was that, and I re-watched the
VOD, and he was like, wait, is that Doki Bird the real one?

663
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:10,770
And then he was, like, asking his friend, he was like, yo,
was she streaming right now?

664
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:13,730
And then he was like, nah, she offline.

665
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:15,230
He was like, what the?

666
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:17,030
And they were like, what the fuck?

667
01:08:19,650 --> 01:08:21,790
They were like, what the fuck?

668
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:25,650
Why is she like, bro, she played for the love of the game,
bro?

669
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:31,990
They were like, they couldn't comprehend the fact that I was
playing off stream.

670
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:35,270
I was like, like, funky freak.

671
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,550
Like, bro, you think she plays her fun, bro?

672

Thank you, thank you.

711
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:42,150
Sometimes donut seems to hurt your chances of being noticed.

712
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:43,650
Thank you, the super chat.

713
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:44,330

Patroesu, they even super chatty, thank you.

716
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:53,790
Anyway, I think that's really all there is about...

717
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:57,210
Um...

718
01:09:58,050 --> 01:09:58,470
Um...

719
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:03,490
Sorry, I had to reread the message right now.

720
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:05,310
But that's really all about my rivals.

721
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:05,870
We're over.

722
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:07,410
The rivals tangent is done.

723
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:08,850
What if I just play rivals right now?

724
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:10,410
But I won't do that to you guys right yet.

725
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:23,210
the bank story okay okay oh my god i fucking hate my bank i

01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:48,790
and i'm definitely okay i'll tell you i'll give you guys
this context um my picked this bank um because she knew it

729
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:58,970
was a bad bank and like so so like she was like she wanted
to take advantage of that and like disgusting and anyway so

730
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:11,530
um I didn't realize how bad of a bank um this particular
bank was until all the problems um all the problems showed

731
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:12,910
up while I was trying

732
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:28,870
so um you know after i started living on my own and taking
back my own business um i really i because i didn't because

733
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:39,750
like my mom handled controlled the banks she controlled the
business and um so i didn't realize how bad this bank was

734
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:44,950
until i took re-took over my entire business Plus ago.

735
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:47,390
So, and like started living on my own.

736
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,150
And then I, oh my God, cannot wait for me to leave this
bank.

737
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:54,710
I, oh, I'm, oh my God.

738
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:58,630
Okay, so anyway, I fucking have to go through so much shit.

739
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:03,050
No, she just took control over the business and my bank,
like the bank, the business bank account.

740
01:12:03,410 --> 01:12:12,450
Because she was the one that opened, she was the one that
opened the business bank account.

741
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:22,410
it and um and she picked this bank so god i hate this bank
by the way like i know i keep saying it but bro it's so

742
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:29,610
fucking bad i'm gonna tell you why this new story you guys
already know so many stories about this bank um uh ashram

743
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:38,630
thank you for the five gift of ships thank you thing the
thing is when i took over the um when i took over this my

744
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:45,590
business again and also the bank accounts I created a new
business bank account under a new business name, you know,

745
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:48,070
because I wanted to like, you know, I wanted to go clean
slate.

746
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:49,750
Like, you know, this is my own business.

747
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:52,910
My parents are not involved in this.

748
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:54,070
This is my own.

749
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:58,970
And I went with the same bank because I didn't realize how
fucking bad it was.

750
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:02,010
Because I was like, well, my parents, my mom picked this
bank.

751
01:13:02,230 --> 01:13:04,490
So clearly she knew what she was doing.

752
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:07,630
So I might as well go with the same bank.

753
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:10,350
So because, like, obviously there shouldn't be any problems.

754
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:12,570
was so fucking wrong.

755
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:15,830
There were so many problems.

756
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:24,150
Because I didn't realize how bad it was until I had to take
over it.

757
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:26,870
But it was so late.

758
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:32,970
I already made a new bank account with my new business
underneath this particular bank.

759
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:42,090
But yes, some guys, some of the Canadians who know about the
worst bank in Canada know exactly which bank it because

760
01:13:42,090 --> 01:14:08,610
there's only one really bad bank in Canada one exceptionally
terrible bank in Canada and so um um anyway so today um I

761
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:20,090
had to call them because I'm tired of doing wire transfers
by going to the branch because every other fucking bank in

762
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:35,810
the world does not require you to go to travel to the branch
to do wire transfers um and so I was like obviously uh maybe

763
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:42,590
uh maybe you know I'm gonna call them because like I was
talking to my manager about this because like they're like

764
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:47,390
okay you have to pay this person you have to pay that person
and i was like and they're like did you pay this person yet

765
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:57,470
i was like no because i have to walk over to the bank um to
i have to do like a like a really long walk to the bank to

766
01:14:57,470 --> 01:15:03,570
do it and i don't want to do it for one wire transfer so i'm
waiting for it to all build up until and then i go there and

767
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:12,850
i just do like four to five wire transfers um at once so you
know because i don't fucking, you know, just do it one at a

768
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:13,230
time.

769
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:16,510
So they're like, what the fuck?

770
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:20,370
So my bad just like, what the fuck?

771
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:24,930
Like, you know, like, he knows it.

772
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:25,750
He knows I have to do it.

773
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:29,350
He's like, he still can't, he still can't wrap his head
around.

774
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:31,830
Because I've told this to him multiple times.

775
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:39,210
But he still can't wrap it around in his head that I have to
walk over there to do the wire transfer.

776
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:45,590
And I was like, what, isn't that how all, like when I first
told him this, he's like, I was like, isn't that how all

777
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:46,370
banks do that?

778
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:47,670
And he's like, no.

779
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:52,930
He's like, no, what the, yeah, in the 70s.

780
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:53,790
Like, yeah.

781
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:57,350
He's like, I don't know.

782
01:15:57,490 --> 01:16:00,770
In the fucking 70s, like, it's 2025.

783
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:10,130
Like, so, you're like, yeah, maybe 30 years ago, maybe.

784
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:13,310
Like, not now.

785
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:14,530
Like, everyone thinks it's did it.

786
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:15,610
I was like, what?

787
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:17,570
I was like, no, that's not true.

788
01:16:17,930 --> 01:16:19,250
They don't defeat.

789
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:20,770
I asked so many.

790
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:24,430
They're like, you gotta go to the branch to do your wire
transfers.

791
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:29,970
And no, I'm not talking about e-transfers.

792
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:37,930
I meant wire transfer, international wire transfers that
cannot do online, apparently.

793
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:46,790
And then, like, when I pay, like, Americans like they are
like just do it online here's their information and I was

794
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:53,590

795
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:55,950

796
01:16:55,950 --> 01:17:06,190
now and it's closed they're like obviously like my American

797
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:10,030
do you mean like just do it I'm like no, I can't do that.

798
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:11,310
The bank is closed.

799
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:15,910
I can't I can't just like I'm sorry the bank is closed Or
I'll be like I'm sorry.

803
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:28,150

01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:49,830
I can't keep walking it to the bank.

807
01:17:50,690 --> 01:18:01,050
Um, I can't keep walking to the bank to like make a, uh,
wire transfer.

808
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:08,010
Like, it's just not convenient or like, it's just, it's so
un, it's so unorthodox.

809
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:17,910
of him to do so no Canada is so fucking weird with
technology they're like they're like I swear to God there's

810
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:26,370
so much bureaucracy in Canada and like there's so much
bureaucracy in Canada and like so many hoops to jump through

811
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:41,930
I feel like i'm not living in the 21st century like like
it's just canada it's literally just canadian things

812
01:18:46,870 --> 01:19:01,110
so um anyway um so i called i called my mink and now it's
just like i called my branch and i was want to like uh want

813
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:11,850
to know like i have to um i have okay i lied by the way i
had so i called my bank and i started lying and i was like

814
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:26,910
oh i have to go out of country um in like um in like a month
or two and um i have to go to the states and the thing is um

815
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:40,950
um this bank bank branch it's gonna be very far away to
where i have to where you know where i have to be stationed

816
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:49,770
for my business trip um and i'll be staying there for like a
couple of months so i was just wondering if there is a way

817
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:56,230
because if i say like oh i wonder why it transfers why i
live close by in canada they'll be like oh i'm sorry ma'am

818
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:57,630
just go to the nearest t

819
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:10,020
I'm sorry, a lot of rage came in.

820
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:19,350
Sorry, just go to the nearest bank branch.

821
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:30,230
Sorry, I said just go to the, I'm sorry to say the newest
bank branch.

822
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:34,390
And then you'll be fine because, you know, it's Canada.

823
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:35,490
It's Canada.

824
01:20:36,190 --> 01:20:38,930
And I said the bank, the Canadian bank.

825
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:48,630
Anyway, yeah, I was trying to say the bank.

826
01:20:49,770 --> 01:21:10,150
Anyway, anyway, yeah, so as I was saying, So, obviously, I
had to make up a scenario to, like, figure out what the fuck

827
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:10,390
to do.

828
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:24,190
for the wide transfer and so sorry my Canadian accent went
really strong there um so I was saying like oh like in one

829
01:21:24,190 --> 01:21:31,910
to two months I have a business trip where I have to be in
the States for a while so I was wondering um like the

830
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:37,810
closest uh bank um like the closest branch of your bank

831
01:21:41,390 --> 01:21:47,170
Um, so I have a lot of important wire transfers I have to
make for my business.

832
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:54,310
So I was wondering, like, uh, I was what, well, I used to
work for this crowd.

833
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:55,250
Yeah, it was bad.

834
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:56,770
I, it was so bad.

835
01:21:57,050 --> 01:21:58,630
It's, it still is.

836
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:08,910
Um, anyway, I was wondering if there is like an easier way
to do this wire transfer because I don't want to travel an

837
01:22:08,910 --> 01:22:10,390
hour or two away.

838
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:15,390
to an hour or two away to do this wire transfer.

839
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:17,250
You know, obviously.

840
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:24,550
But like, they'll do, like, no, I just don't want to walk,
like, I just didn't walk, like, several walks to this

841
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:26,750
goddamn fucking bank, like, in general.

842
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:33,110
Even though the walk is, like, less than 30 minutes, I don't
fucking want to walk there.

843
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:37,430
Like, he doesn't know I'm actually still going to be in
Canada.

844
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:49,310
I was like, anyway, so the guy, he was like, oh, we have
something called the global money transfer.

845
01:22:51,150 --> 01:22:53,630
And you can do that online or on your app.

846
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:57,130
And I was like, oh, really?

847
01:22:57,670 --> 01:23:00,230
And he was like, yeah, it's called the global money
transfer.

848
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:04,230
And your account should be able to do it.

849
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:06,790
And you can do it online.

850
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:08,790
And it's really simple.

851
01:23:08,910 --> 01:23:12,350
Just check it out on your app or on your PC.

852
01:23:13,190 --> 01:23:15,210
And I was like, can't be that easy.

853
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:20,330
Like, surely it can't be that easy.

854
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:23,330
So I was like, okay, sure.

855
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:24,290
All right, thank you.

856
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:27,170
And then, you know, stupid me.

857
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:33,410
Instead of, you know, trying it out right away, I walked
dead.

858
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:36,390
I ate dinner.

859
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:54,870
the the bank is closed i got on my pc um and looked for it
global money transfer for my bank i logged into my bank

860
01:23:54,870 --> 01:24:05,810
account i clicked on the option global money transfer um and
then what do i see your account is not eligible for global

861
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:13,890
money transfer uh you are small business account um please
go to wire transfer to see how you can do wire transfer

862
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:31,970
by the way when i called my branch they are very aware that
my account is a small business account and they still

863
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:35,590
recommended me global money transfer

864
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:57,630
So, so I'm like thinking, why the fuck did you recommend me
this?

865
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:03,770
When you know damn well my account is not eligible.

866
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:21,970
So, I don't know, I don't know what to do, I don't fucking
know what to do, I don't know, maybe I'll call tomorrow, I

867
01:25:21,970 --> 01:25:41,450
don't fucking know, by the way, by the way, here's a little
other My bank told me because I was like, oh, I'm going to

868
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:46,410
be in the States and like maybe in a month or two for a
business trip.

869
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:52,230
And they were like, oh, yeah, we can't really help you when
you're in the States, by the way, ma'am.

870
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:59,730
Because our bank in America, even though we have branches
there, it's not owned by us.

871
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:01,310
It's owned by the United States.

872
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:07,410
So like, it's actually a different company that operates
our...

873
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:08,370
The bank's there.

874
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:14,630
So, like, we can't really help you much for your Canadian
accounts if you're going to be using the American branch

875
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:16,250
side of our bank.

876
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:18,850
And I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?

877
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:24,290
What do you mean?

878
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:26,150
Then why are they called

879
01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:32,510
by the Canadian side?

880
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:34,870
It's owned by the America.

881
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:41,470
And it's apparently a fully different corporation that runs
the American...

882
01:26:41,490 --> 01:27:01,060
American side Like I was like you have the same name and
logo Like I was like what do you mean they get so If I go to

883
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:13,120
the American Branch of this particular bank they will not be
able to assist me on my Canadian accounts because they do

884
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:23,100
not have the oh my god what's the word they do not have the
access to it because they are the american branch side and

885
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:26,540
it's owned by a different corporation so

886
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:45,480
they don't have the authority to access or the
infrastructure to access my account and And I'm like, what?

887
01:27:51,890 --> 01:28:05,990
And then, and then, they were like, also, um, ma'am, if, um,
if we have to send you anything, like, new cards or, uh,

888
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:16,370
they're like, if you need, we need to send you anything,
like, um, new cards or, uh, new credit cards or any banking

889
01:28:16,370 --> 01:28:16,890
information.

890
01:28:16,910 --> 01:28:26,190
via mail um we won't be able to send it to you at your uh
american address or any of the american branches because

891
01:28:26,190 --> 01:28:34,230
like we said we have no affiliation with the american side
of our bank because it is owned by a different corporation

892
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:46,890
um i was like what and um you'll only be able to pick it up
when you're back in canada and i was just like what if i'm

business trip for like I don't know, half a year, like, in

895
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:27,840
not even just the States, but just, like, somewhere else in
the world.

896
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:30,540
Like, what the fuck am I going to do?

897
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:34,600

898
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:39,240

924
01:32:51,920 --> 01:33:06,540
you a story about one time I had to deal, I had to deal with
Canadian, with Canadian airports.

925
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:24,560
This was a long time, this was a while ago, but it was when,
this was a long time ago, When we were trying to like, this

926
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:25,920
was not with dad.

927
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:29,580
This was for another, like our older dog.

928
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:40,100
And we had to like, we had to like fly us and our dog to
like, I think it was to the States.

929
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:41,280
No, no.

930
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,840
It was, oh my God, it wasn't even to the States.

931
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:45,040
It was like somewhere in Canada.

932
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:47,740
We had to fly to somewhere in Canada.

933
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:48,900
And we had to bring our other dog.

934
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:52,900
It was a weiner dog too.

935
01:33:53,880 --> 01:34:00,000
And we brought, we wanted to bring, put him in like the
sitting seat and everything.

936
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:07,900
We wanted to bring him in with the, like, you know, put him
under the, like the sitting area.

937
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:11,840
And so like down there in the storage for the bags.

938
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,880
So, you know, we brought our little, our dog carrier.

939
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:17,820
But there's a lot of rules for the play.

940
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:20,620
And the thing is...

941
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:28,600
With these rules, they're like, we won't let you, the
carrier has to be this size.

942
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:30,720
The carrier has to be this size.

943
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:38,340
And also, um, but it has to be big enough for your dog.

944
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:40,240
But it has to be this size.

945
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:49,400
The thing is, so we bought this carrier that we thought that
was good size requirement for our dog.

946
01:34:51,380 --> 01:35:00,180
we're like this should be good because there's enough space
for him and also it seems all right so we brought it along

947
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:08,920
and then everything seems fine until the magic came over and
was like your carrier's too big and we're like what and

948
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:17,420
they're like what kind of dog is it and they looked at it
and they're like oh he's gonna be you need a smaller carrier

949
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:25,180
but if you get a small carrier for him he's too long for it
so it's not comfortable so we cannot accept this carrier

950
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:41,960
because whatever side even if you get the correct carrier
the size carrier um he the dog is too long for it so i was

951
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:50,340
obviously my parents and i we were so confused because we
were like but this is This is a normal carrier that we

952
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:51,960
bought in Ikea like

953
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:59,900
Yeah, the dog was too long because he was a weiner dog.

954
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:09,200
So we bought like anything shorter because the carrier was
just too long So so we bought everything shorter He will not

955
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:20,640
be able to like Stand in it like he won't be able to like
stand stretched out in it because he's just too long so so

956
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:32,540
they're like um so then we had that no it was the the cabin
the cabin so so they're like you have to we you have to go

957
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:43,160
out and buy a it was like the metal the kennel we have to
put our dog like we were trying to avoid putting our dog in

958
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:49,420
the baggage storage because like you know we don't know how
he's like we we were scared i was gonna give him trauma

959
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:55,940
because like i assume it's gonna be really cold and really
loud so we wanted to go with the um because he's still a

960
01:36:55,940 --> 01:37:05,000
small dog so we wanted to go with the care like the the
carrier option and they were like yeah we don't we sold out

961
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:13,180
of kennels so um you're gonna have to go out to nearest pet
store um and uh buy a

962
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:17,180
as he's comfortable.

963
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:24,440
So I was just like, but after all of that, um, we were,
they're like, okay, um, everything that I can check in now.

964
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:27,580
And, and then this was a night flight.

965
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:28,240
Okay.

966
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:39,240
For those who don't know, in the, um, in the, uh, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, the, the security sector, they close

967
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:44,520
at around, I think like they close at night.

968
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:49,340
So I don't remember it was like go i don't remember it was
like 11 30 or 10 30.

969
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:52,540
so the thing is i think it was 11 30.

970
01:37:52,880 --> 01:38:01,760
so security closes at 11 30 so it doesn't matter if like you
know the flight is like 12 oh i think it's 10 30 i think

971
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:09,200
it's 10 30 because so they're like it doesn't matter if your
flight is like midnight or anything it doesn't matter like

972
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:14,080
the security closes at 10 30 so you have to get past it
before

973
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:23,820
So, I was like, I was like, oh, we're all so early.

974
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:24,780
Yay.

975
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:28,480
We're going to be able to make it in time.

976
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:30,840
And also grab dinner.

977
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:33,320
I'm so hungry.

978
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:40,800
So, so we were like, you know, an hour plus early.

979
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:45,420
And I was like, yippee, we're going to grab dinner.

980
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:55,440
And then we, you know, we had to do a lot, like whoever, if
anyone, to anyone that has ever, um, shipped their pet in a

981
01:38:55,440 --> 01:39:01,900
kennel, um, on a plane trip, uh, never have hope, Doki.

982
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:10,100
Anyway, um, little Doki knows she was not about to get
there.

983
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:15,680
So, um, um, so anyway.

984
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:20,920
Um, no, it was like an hour before 1030.

985
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:23,440
It was more than an hour before 1030.

986
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,080
So, you know, we got, we checked everything in, our baggage
and everything.

987
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:36,560
And then, um, and then, you know, we had all the tags for
the dog for the kennel stuff.

988
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:41,780
Like, all there was so much stuff, you know, like tags and
like, um, wires and stuff like that.

989
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:44,440
You have to lock it, all the cages and everything, all these
stickers.

990
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:47,080
Wait right here.

991
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:51,440
You gotta wait for a person to help you bring your dog
through security.

992
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:54,780
We were like, me and my family were like, okay.

993
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:57,120
So we waited.

994
01:39:58,260 --> 01:39:59,200
And we waited.

995
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:01,380
And we waited.

996
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:10,340
And then the lady, or sorry, the man that was like, you
know, the flight, I don't know what they're called.

997
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:16,160
The people that were helping you check in baggage people
were like making calls.

998
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:29,220
everything because the thing is the dog needs to go through
their own form of security before they are able to go

999
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:40,680
through um to the plane but we had to be there so we waited
and then 30 minutes past the flight attendant the the the is

1000
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:45,880
it flight attendant like they were the ones that check in
your your tickets and your luggage they're like they made

1001
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:54,940
another call i was like where are you you know like where
are you so then we're like oh and then finally um a guy

1002
01:40:54,940 --> 01:41:01,500
pushing cart came over and yeah they need to ask my dog some
questions they want to know where is he going like why are

1003
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:10,080
you going there so the airline sorry sorry so then you know
a guy came over with a cart and he was like he's like all

1004
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:16,280
right we're here we're here so we're like where do we go
yeah they're like okay you have to take your dog over there

1005
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:23,980
like pointing vaguely so we were so confused my family and i
were so confused by the way like you know there is 30

1006
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:31,300
minutes have passed by then so we were very confused we're
like okay um and then um okay we're gonna stop the story

1007
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:35,500
here because i need to blow my nose give me a sec i don't
have tissue right oh wait i do never mind jk i just gotta

1008
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:43,740
mute myself sorry cliffhanger does this dog have But that's
the thing.

1009
01:41:43,940 --> 01:41:44,940
That's what the security is for.

1010
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:50,840
They want to check the kennel if there's fucking bombs or
drugs hidden in his fucking blankets.

1011
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:53,220
So...

1012
01:41:56,890 --> 01:41:59,250
What the fuck the dog is doing?

1013
01:41:59,450 --> 01:42:00,930
The dog is the bomb.

1014
01:42:02,870 --> 01:42:06,370
So, anyway, um, that was the whole point.

1015
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:10,850
Anyway, so, yeah, it's my dog a terrorist.

1016
01:42:12,850 --> 01:42:22,150
So, um, um, anyway so we were confused me my family and the
cart pusher were so confused because i don't fucking know

1017
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:30,770
why he doesn't know where to go because we assumed that he
knew where to go just because like you know it's his job

1018
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:40,190
like the the airline staff literally called him over to take
our dog to wherever he's supposed to go so we're just

1019
01:42:40,190 --> 01:42:42,470
standing here and then the security

1020
01:42:45,590 --> 01:42:56,310
the line for the security went up to us and was like um you
guys gotta hurry um because um security closes at uh 10 30

1021
01:42:56,310 --> 01:43:05,490
and you won't be able to enter like enter through the gates
after that so obviously we were like panicking because um

1022
01:43:05,490 --> 01:43:20,930
there was 30 minutes left before security closes so we're
like And then one of the one guy one of the security the the

1023
01:43:20,930 --> 01:43:29,310
security staff that checks like um oversized baggages or
like and like um to put bags through the check-in badge came

1024
01:43:29,310 --> 01:43:42,370
over and was like you pointing to the guy pushing the car
you um you need to go all under underground and then around

1025
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:51,750
and it's through this door so you can go through the staff
door with the dog um oh no you have to go through here so we

1026
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:59,830
can get you checked out um and you have to go through all
the way from the underground staff door yeah it's a maze

1027
01:43:59,830 --> 01:44:08,450
apparently and then and through that door through this door
to come to security um and then he didn't have to bring the

1028
01:44:08,450 --> 01:44:14,970
dog but the staff had to do that because it's part of like
security to make sure the staff doesn't carry anything like

1029
01:44:14,970 --> 01:44:21,070
to make sure the staff also isn't hiding anything dangerous
so and then the staff was like what do you mean that's not

1030
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:28,310
how we do it and then the security guy was like no that's
how our airport has done this this always so i don't know

1031
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:34,370
and then like the attendant the airline attendant came over
and was like no that's not how we do it i don't understand

1032
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:39,570
that's not how we always do it and then the I was like, no,
we've always done this for years.

1033
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:40,570
I don't know why.

1034
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:44,370
You don't know the proper protocols of how to do it.

1035
01:44:44,610 --> 01:44:49,010
Because we're like, why can't we just push the cart over to
the security check?

1036
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:51,670
Because it was just in front of us.

1037
01:44:53,190 --> 01:44:56,350
It was literally 10 steps away.

1038
01:44:57,050 --> 01:45:01,630
Like we literally, and he was like, you can bring the dog
over and put the cart here.

1039
01:45:01,690 --> 01:45:02,670
And we walked 10 steps.

1040
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:05,250
Put the dog in the security check table.

1041
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:19,190
and and um and then later he was like all right now you to
the staff guy you have to go underground go around here take

1042
01:45:19,190 --> 01:45:30,890
the elevator come back up and show up from this door and
then we can do the security check on the dog and then me and

1043
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:38,870
my family just stood there and waited for this one guy to
show up from that one door.

1044
01:45:45,790 --> 01:45:49,070
And then the scaredy guy was like, it's protocol.

1045
01:45:49,410 --> 01:45:50,510
Like, you have to do it.

1046
01:45:50,570 --> 01:45:52,970
We've done, this is how we do all our pet checks.

1047
01:45:53,450 --> 01:46:01,250
I'm like, why does he have to go through some fucking hunger
game trials?

1048
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:05,230
Like, he doesn't even, like, we don't even know this man.

1049
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:08,270
He just worked for the airline.

1050
01:46:08,990 --> 01:46:11,690
Like, I don't know this guy.

1051
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:16,940
So, okay.

1052
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:20,160
For those, let me see if I can draw this out.

1053
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:26,920
So, and then, like, it's just airport bureaucracy.

1054
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:31,360
Okay.

1055
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:35,000
All right.

1056
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:36,340
And then...

1057
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,480
Okay, I'm gonna draw this out.

1058
01:46:39,620 --> 01:46:41,040
It's gonna be really bad.

1059
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:42,440
And then...

1060
01:46:43,540 --> 01:46:45,440
And then there's...

1061
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,420
And then...

1062
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:50,820
Man.

1063
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,020
The security man.

1064
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:06,380
Okay, so... Okay, so let me draw this out.

1065
01:47:10,820 --> 01:47:20,660
Okay, I don't know if it makes sense at all, but basically,
all right, let me grab the picture.

1066
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,940
Okay, so there's a dog.

1067
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,460
There's me and my family.

1068
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:37,080
There's a security man, and the staff guy has to come out
from this door, and he will not accept anything else.

1069
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:49,440
He cannot show up, you know, through the hot like through
the regular people area He has to show up from this door and

1070
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:52,140
only this door like

1071
01:47:55,570 --> 01:48:00,030
So the thing is to get to this door.

1072
01:48:00,370 --> 01:48:11,930
Let me draw another dot like picture for you guys So is that
This Okay, okay, wait, wait This is the door He had there's

1073
01:48:11,930 --> 01:48:22,290
like An underground system He has to go through an elevator
He takes an elevator L and it goes Straight down and then

1074
01:48:22,290 --> 01:48:27,990
there's like The door

1075
01:48:32,570 --> 01:48:52,610
From what he was Explaining Okay And then second first
elevator there you go he has to go through first elevator

1076
01:48:52,610 --> 01:49:08,790
and then to the second elevator second and then this is the
dog sorry I'm not drawing anything yet alright there you go

1077
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:10,470
I'm not showing anything yet okay here you go

1078
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:17,140
it's I fucking hate Canada sometimes.

1079
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:21,880
I hate the bureaucracy and how backwards everything is.

1080
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:25,760
So, here's another picture.

1081
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:35,280
So, to illustrate.

1082
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:38,320
To illustrate this.

1083
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:40,380
He has to go through.

1084
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,320
He could, you know, he could just walk to the there and then
we're all here.

1085
01:49:44,740 --> 01:49:48,960
But the thing is, he has to take the first episode.

1086
01:49:48,980 --> 01:50:01,880
elevator and then go through this like a maze and then go to
the second elevator and then because let's go through

1087
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:17,760
security sorry there's security right here okay sorry let me
draw like red like beep beep beep beep security security

1088
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:20,780
there you go So...

1089
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:27,180
So, yeah, it's like the Disney tunnels.

1090
01:50:28,020 --> 01:50:31,960
So, he's got to do his own security right here.

1091
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:37,400
And he's like, you know, first elevator, second, and then
security down here.

1092
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,640
And then that's not us, by the way.

1093
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:41,000
It's the staff member.

1094
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:43,660
Like...

1095
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:48,960
And it takes the second elevator to go through this store.

1096
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:59,680
This door right here while we're all waiting so it was like,
you know white rabbit tapping the clock tick-tock tick-tock

1097
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:01,500
like when it

1098
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:18,960
So we waited and we waited and then we're like where the
fuck is this guy Like the security guy was like don't worry

1099
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:28,220
like he'll show up soon like he'll show up soon don't worry
we've done this many times he'll show up and my parents and

1100
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:42,220
i we waited and 10 minutes passed fifth another five minutes
passed soon there was 10 minutes till 10 30.

1101
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:58,360
it was 10 20 and the guy has yet to show up and then and
then one of the ladies at the other security booth came up

1102
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:12,580
to us and was like he came back he didn't know where to go
and he came back and we were like what

1103
01:52:16,050 --> 01:52:20,150
what do you mean he came back up

1104
01:52:28,250 --> 01:52:32,770
There were five minutes left.

1105
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:49,760
And the security guy was like, was like, okay, let me get
the flight attendant to stay on standby.

1106
01:52:51,480 --> 01:53:00,740
Because like, the thing is, While we were waiting, he was
like, I'll just do the security check now.

1107
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:10,080
And then all we had to do is wait for him to show up and we
can drop the dog in the cart and he can take it to the

1108
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:10,500
plane.

1109
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:11,900
So we're like, okay.

1110
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:18,720
So he was just literally, you know, like, I don't, it wasn't
even that complicated of the security check.

1111
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:25,360
Like, all he had to do was just pat the bed to make sure we
didn't fucking sneak in each.

1112
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:27,360
He wasn't even touching the dog.

1113
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:31,680
He didn't care if the dog had a goddamn bomb or drugs up his
ass.

1114
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:36,600
He was making sure that the bomb and the drugs was not in
the bed.

1115
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:37,840
That's it.

1116
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:44,480
And so he was just patting the bed and making sure.

1117
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:47,060
And it was like, you know, we were like, hold your dog.

1118
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:47,940
And we're like, okay.

1119
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:50,840
And then he was just patting the bed and everything.

1120
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:53,860
And it was done in like, like three minutes.

1121
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:57,440
He didn't care if the dog had anything.

1122
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:02,340
Just as long as it's not in the bed or in the kennel.

1123
01:54:02,940 --> 01:54:06,740
And then we put the dog back into the kennel.

1124
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:13,580
And then we're just waiting for the security.

1125
01:54:14,020 --> 01:54:17,740
Waiting for the staff guy to push our dog.

1126
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:22,860
Through like the security area to the play.

1127
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:24,460
And...

1128
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:35,520
and then when we realized it five minutes left um the
security guy was like okay we're gonna get the we're i'm

1129
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:41,340
going to the flight attendant and like he's just gonna stand
there and wait for you guys because like protocol wise thank

1130
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:49,940
god he finally fucking broke protocol because he was like
yeah no you just you sorry i think it was 11 30 by the way

1131
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:58,860
it was definitely it was 11 30 it was not 10 30 because I
feel like 10 30 the restaurants will still be open but it

1132
01:54:58,860 --> 01:55:06,780
was like and then he's like you stand there and wait with
where the staff got to show up so so the family can go

1133
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:15,840
through security and we managed to go through we were the
last people and literally it was three minutes left till

1134
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:25,200
closing we're literally the last people that went through
security and we did not get dinner because everything was

1135
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:26,040
closed.

1136
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:39,340
So little dokey, so bright, hopeful, and did not eat
anything for dinner because all she was thinking about was,

1137
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:40,340
yippee!

1138
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:43,280
I can't wait to get some food inside.

1139
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:48,560
Because I was like, Mama, can we get white spot?

1140
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:51,540
Because, like, there's white spot right now.

1141
01:55:51,640 --> 01:56:01,520
Can we get white spot before we check in and then mama was
like don't worry we can eat inside the terminal i was like

Yeah, so...

1146

Poor little turkey.

Like, yippee!

1148
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:37,820
I can win the tournament, huh?

1149
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:49,200
The only meal that sad child ever eaten in Forturus is
disappointment, red tape, and society on the side.

1150
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:51,520
Patreus, do they even super chat that you can take it?

1151
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:53,460

The airplane way.

1200
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:54,520
That's how much, that's how traumatic it was.

1201
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:57,580
The fact that I remember what the fuck these pretzels taste
like.

1202
02:03:57,860 --> 02:03:59,020

1222
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:44,160
Oh, but anyway, that's how fucked Canadian bureaucracy is.

1223
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:47,360
I mean, I told you guys the vet stories.

1224
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:49,220
Like, that shit is wild.

1225
02:06:49,820 --> 02:06:55,760
The hoops I have to jump through to, like, get my dog
prescription and everything.

1226
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:58,440
I think that shit.

1227
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:03,340
By the way, I recently learned that Canadian...

1228
02:07:03,820 --> 02:07:16,320
I thought, guys, I thought Canadian Amazon, oh, oh my gosh,
okay, so I found out the difference between, like, Canadian

1229
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:18,700
Amazon and American Amazon.

1230
02:07:19,540 --> 02:07:29,060
So, like, one of my friends, they were asking me about,
like, the dog food that I have to, like, the special diet,

1231
02:07:29,140 --> 02:07:33,500
and they're like, oh, what kind of, like, dog food, because
they were planning on putting their dog on a special diet as

1232
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:33,720
well.

1233
02:07:33,820 --> 02:07:41,500
so they were like asking what brand it was and I was like oh
um it's hills um that's the brand I use and my dog is on

1234
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:45,320
kidney care and then they're like oh yeah I'm gonna try and
order it because I was like you can just order it off of

1235
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:51,100
Amazon because that's what I do and they're like oh okay so
they try to order it off of Amazon and then they're like

1236
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:59,700
wait it says I need like a prescription from my vet I was
like what the fuck you know like what do you mean so

1237
02:07:59,700 --> 02:08:10,160
apparently special diets for dogs or America, um, your vet
has to prescribe it to you.

1238
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:12,620
But in Canada, they don't fucking care.

1239
02:08:12,780 --> 02:08:14,060
Just order it off of Amazon.

1240
02:08:15,200 --> 02:08:15,400
Yeah.

1241
02:08:15,740 --> 02:08:15,920
Yeah.

1242
02:08:16,260 --> 02:08:25,760
So I'm like, you have to like grab a special number from
your vet to like be given permission to order like special

1243
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:28,460
food for your pets in America.

1244
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:34,580
But in Canada, I literally find the food and then I order it
off of Amazon.

1245
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:36,940
I get it in one to two days.

1246
02:08:39,140 --> 02:08:42,440
Because our food, there's no, it's not a prescription.

1247
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:45,440
You know, it's just like recommended.

1248
02:08:45,640 --> 02:08:47,780
They're like, yeah, we recommend you get this dog food.

1249
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:49,620
And then like, I just order it.

1250
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:54,540
Like it's, yeah, it's, you can't just, that's like, it's so
weird.

1251
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:55,580
I was like, what?

1252
02:08:55,820 --> 02:08:58,320
Like, I should just buy it off of Amazon.

1253
02:08:58,340 --> 02:09:00,340
It comes in in one to two days.

1254
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:01,440
Like, it's so...

1255
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:03,560
But the thing is, it's so weird.

1256
02:09:03,780 --> 02:09:04,360
It's so weird.

1257
02:09:04,460 --> 02:09:08,360
Like, there's, like, certain things you can't just order off
of Amazon Canada.

1258
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:10,260
Certain things you can, apparently, in America.

1259
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:11,720
It's, like, so weird.

1260
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:13,240
Hmm.

1261
02:09:16,060 --> 02:09:24,860
Because, in Canada, there are, like, you know, medication
and, and, like, not, like, you know, bad drugs, but, like,

1262
02:09:24,900 --> 02:09:29,320
medication drugs that you have to be prescribed on.

1263
02:09:29,320 --> 02:09:32,100
or you have to prescribe to get it.

1264
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:36,040
And like, you can't get off the counter or anything.

1265
02:09:36,460 --> 02:09:43,220
Like, you actually have to ask the, you have to ask the
pharmacist to, like, grab, like, some certain medications or

1266
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:50,260
some certain, like, special drugs, monitor drugs or
anything, like, from the pharmacist to be able to purchase

1267
02:09:50,260 --> 02:09:52,840
it because it's all, like, locked, like, behind counter.

1268
02:09:53,500 --> 02:10:03,120
But then, I found out, because, like, one time, similar
story um they're asking me about a certain medication i

1269
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:12,760
forgot what it was i was like oh yeah yeah i can um yeah you
can just grab that um you can have you get it like uh uh you

1270
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:19,140
have to ask the pharmacist uh to be able to or get it
prescribed and you're like oh i could just order it off of

1271
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:33,920
amazon i was like what what do you mean by that yeah see
comes in like or two days i just it's just on amazon i was

1272
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:40,280
like what the do you mean i have to walk to the pharmacy and
ask if they have it in stock and then like purchase it at

1273
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:50,420
the pharmacy i was like what do you mean you can just order
it online yeah so it was like yeah apparently what was it

1274
02:10:50,420 --> 02:11:00,060
melatonin for melatonin in canada you can't just amazon
order melatonin you have to you have to get that like

1275
02:11:00,060 --> 02:11:08,960
because you know you have to ask the pharmacist like to be
like oh yeah I would like to have some um but like in

1276
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:24,720
America you can just Amazon order it you don't need a
prescription you just have to go to the pharmacy and like

1277
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:28,740
you have to go to the pharmacy and ask for it but Because
it's off the counter.

1278
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:29,820
It's not on the counter.

1279
02:11:29,980 --> 02:11:34,300
You have to ask for it and be like, um, can I get some
melatonin?

1280
02:11:34,860 --> 02:11:36,440
And they're like, yeah, yeah.

1281
02:11:37,660 --> 02:11:38,020
Um.

1282
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:41,880
Um, oh, is it now off the shelf?

1283
02:11:41,960 --> 02:11:45,500
I remember before it was like, you have to go to the
pharmacy.

1284
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:49,480
You have to like, just be like, can I have like melatonin?

1285
02:11:49,740 --> 02:11:56,340
Uh, I guess, I guess we passed the law and be like, you can
do it now.

1286
02:11:56,340 --> 02:12:03,180
But there are some medications That like, I don't remember
which one it was I don't remember which medication it was

1287
02:12:03,180 --> 02:12:07,060
Cause like, it was a while ago And they're like, no, I'm
just ordering it off of Amazon I was like, what the fuck do

1288
02:12:07,060 --> 02:12:07,380
you mean?

1289
02:12:07,480 --> 02:12:13,100
I have to fucking I was like, I have to walk to the pharmacy
Like, what do you mean?

1290
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:14,680
You can just order it online

1291
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:31,500
Yeah, um, so like It's fucking, I hate Ken, the bureaucracy,
but like sometimes it's good.

1292
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:39,420
Sometimes we have some positives, like, you know, we can, at
least we can order, at least we can order dog food online.

1293
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:43,000
Like, this is the thing I don't understand.

1294
02:12:43,160 --> 02:12:49,320
We need a prescription, like in America, you need a
prescription for dog food, but like, who the fuck cares

1295
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:50,880
about human medication?

1296
02:12:51,820 --> 02:12:55,660
Who the fuck cares about human medication?

1297
02:12:56,340 --> 02:13:07,420
like it's just uh no but the thing is you yes you can order
dog food online but like it has to be prescribed like the

1298
02:13:07,420 --> 02:13:16,860
special diet ones the special diet ones it has to you have
to get your vet to like prescribe you the special food but

1299
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:27,100
in canada that you don't do that you just fucking order it
online like like the vet just recommends you the food and

1300
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:36,040
then literally on amazon two to three days it's over like i
don't have to give them any information it just arrives but

1301
02:13:36,040 --> 02:13:43,220
in america it's like you have to jump through so many hoops
to give your dog special food but then like if you want to

1302
02:13:43,220 --> 02:13:49,560
order like medication or like any special type of drugs for
like you Like the actual, not the illegal ones, the legal

1303
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:50,000
ones.

1304
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:51,980
The pharmaceutical drugs.

1305
02:13:52,120 --> 02:13:53,900
Like, you could just order that off of Amazon.

1306
02:13:54,080 --> 02:13:54,820
Who the fuck cares?

1307
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:56,060

I think it was Super Chat.

1321
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:20,920
Thank you, thank you.

1322
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:22,200
What's the story behind the name?

1323
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:28,780
For those who've never heard of TSB, the team, it's Team
Snake Bite.

1324
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:31,780
So the name is Team Snake Bite.

1325
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:38,880
And the team name came from... It was part of an Apex
tournament.

1326
02:14:39,640 --> 02:14:41,780
And it was based...

1327
02:14:41,780 --> 02:14:44,060
We had other names at first.

1328
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:45,980
There was other names.

1329
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:55,420
And then um we i asked a very important question because i
used to ask this question a lot to my homies because i want

1330
02:14:55,420 --> 02:15:01,280
to know if they're a true homie or not you know like this is
the only question this is a question that you ask people to

1331
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:07,140
know if they're a bro or not if they're a real homie and
it's basically like if a snake bit your dick would you would

1332
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:17,060
you suck the poison out of the dick like or let your homie
die so so obviously this is like the only question you ask

1333
02:15:17,260 --> 02:15:18,980
Like, it's the ultimate vibe check, you know?

1334
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:29,180
Like, it's the ultimate bro check to see if, like, he's a
real homie or not.

1335
02:15:29,540 --> 02:15:37,300
So, I asked that question, and then I was like, we were
like, we were brainstorming names before, and I'm like, and

1336
02:15:37,300 --> 02:15:42,900
then we were, like, having a huge debate and everything,
because Axel wouldn't do it, and he still wouldn't.

1337
02:15:42,980 --> 02:15:45,780
It's been years, and he still wouldn't save a homie.

1338
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:48,540
Let that guy die.

1339
02:15:50,200 --> 02:15:52,720
He's like, I ain't sucking poison out.

1340
02:15:55,500 --> 02:15:58,120
it is like, fuck that shit.

1341
02:15:58,620 --> 02:16:00,940
And I was like, bro, that didn't cool, man.

1342
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:05,020
And then I was like, guys, let her call herself Team Snake
Bite.

1343
02:16:10,440 --> 02:16:21,040
So, so, so after we were arguing for like an hour straight
whether or not like he was like what like about why he

1344
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:30,100
should do it and then we were talking about like coffee
pasta and then the chat started spamming like do not wallow

1345
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:38,640
tsp is here to swallow if he's low then you gotta blow for a
win to keep you gotta go deep our throats will get till we

1346
02:16:38,640 --> 02:16:46,320
get the bag so like when we're in the tournament people will
start like spamming this to cheer for us on like broadcasts

1347
02:16:46,320 --> 02:16:51,420
and stuff because you know that's what people do back then
like you know like copy pasta like oh my gosh there was like

1348
02:16:51,420 --> 02:16:58,260
so like you know in esports if you guys ever watched esports
people would make like dumb ass copy pastas but they're so

1349
02:16:58,260 --> 02:17:04,620
fucking clever there's so many like clever shit i don't
remember does anyone remember like the classic esport copy

1350
02:17:04,620 --> 02:17:10,780
pastas that people used to do when you're cheering for your
teams i can't remember them on the top of my head but we

1351
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:18,260
were like replicating that because like you know that brings
team like brings like people to cheer for like you know when

1352
02:17:18,260 --> 02:17:26,060
they want cheer for their team um people would start
chanting these things out so we're like oh we should we

1353
02:17:26,060 --> 02:17:36,200
should make one for our team you know so yeah like people
can spam that like to um spam this yeah spam this pine to

1354
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:47,780
help c9 like shit like that like yeah spam this noodle to
help skedoodle like people would spam that in esports so

1355
02:17:47,780 --> 02:17:54,060
like in like esport tournaments like in any game like league
counter strike overwatch like shit like that so we're like

1356
02:17:54,060 --> 02:18:00,380
oh my god guys we should do something similar for our team
like so to bring up like team spirit for like people who

1357
02:18:00,380 --> 02:18:08,160
want to cheer for us so that's where tsb came from it was
like one of the most the one of and then the thing is by

1358
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:16,960
calling us tsb um it was a japanese tournament because we
called ourselves tsb we didn't call us a team snake bite we

1359
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:30,210
just put tsb so the japanese viewers and the japanese
commentators did not know the context behind our names they

1360
02:18:30,210 --> 02:18:41,690
don't know what the fly the fuck we called ourselves TSB
because like we gave zero context um because we didn't

1361
02:18:41,690 --> 02:18:50,570
explain it like because we were just called TSB so they're
like oh TSB TSB you know so there was like no actual context

1362
02:18:50,570 --> 02:19:04,030
so people were like oh it's so it's so say so it's so normal
but the English speaking side knows the real story they know

1363
02:19:04,030 --> 02:19:14,690
why we were called TSB in the true context so um the
Japanese side didn't know why they just thought it was oh

1364
02:19:14,690 --> 02:19:27,570
TSB you know just TSB like yeah little do they know yeah one
of the commenters praising how cool the name was because it

1365
02:19:27,570 --> 02:19:35,690
sounded cool you know TSB But then we're actually called
Team Snakebite because we're like, will you suck your would

1366
02:19:35,690 --> 02:19:48,290
you suck the poison out of your homies dick like It's like
sweet summer child you don't know the real context Do they

1367
02:19:48,290 --> 02:20:01,470
know they didn't know So that's the context of TSBU is
honestly one of the greatest group names of I've ever came

1368
02:20:01,470 --> 02:20:02,350
up with.

1369
02:20:05,010 --> 02:20:05,490

1370
02:20:06,150 --> 02:20:09,510
Chat came up with it, but I stole it and took credit.

1371
02:20:10,910 --> 02:20:14,890
Because I was like, I looked at chat and someone was like,
you should call yourself Team Snakebite.
