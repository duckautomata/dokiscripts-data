00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,860
Hello, everyone.

2
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,640
Hello, I'm sorry.

3
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,880
I'm sorry for being late.

4
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,460
I literally was about to start and then I got the email about the

5
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,580
VTuber Marvel Rivals thing.

6
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,560
I was just like, oh, okay, let me look through this.

7
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:15,660
And I was just like, I got really worried because like I want this tournament to like go well, you know?

8
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,500
I don't know.

9
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,300
I was just, because there's only two tank players in this tournament.

10
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,240
And, like, there's a lot of people that are like, I can off-roll.

11
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,700
Because it's like, first choices.

12
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,240
Like, what's your main role?

13
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,760
And then they're like, okay, but what's your off-roll then?

14
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,480
So, you know, obviously, some of these players can off-roll.

15
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,000
But, you know, I can say I can off-roll as DPS.

16
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,980
But my off-roll as DPS is, like, plat.

17
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,640
Or some shit.

18
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,340
So it's not like, you know, I hit E-turn.

19
00:02:50,460 --> 00:03:42,720
as support but then if I try to off-roll and I barely play off-roll too so there's like some people that do play tank as an off-roll but like I only have one person that does that on my team so I got some I'm like well I see some teams they do have off-rolls for tank there's one team that has zero tank players I'm worried about them I don't know maybe they'll surprise me maybe they don't need a tank player they'll just they'll just like actually no they have okay actually they have one it's like DPS and tank I think they'll just like maybe they'll they have like and they have an insane DPS player who needs a tank if you have an insane DPS player to be fair um and but There is one team that has like three,

20
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,400
four off-rollers who can play tank.

21
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,720
So, like, uh, so there's that.

22
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:57,600
So it's like, I'm like, it's, it's really sad that we don't have any B-Tuber tank players, which is understandable because who the fuck wants to play tank?

23
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,910
I won't reveal, like, I, it's like, there's some people here that will be very surprised that are participating here.

24
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,550
So I won't reveal who the people are, um, um, that are participating.

25
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:12,690
Um.

26
00:04:13,530 --> 00:05:32,610
and like I'll let you guys when it's revealed you guys would know the thing is I'm like scared because I do want this to be go well and like balancing is the hardest part but there's no fucking vtuber tank players I'm so not surprised because who wants to play tank it is actually like you gotta be a masochist to want to play fucking tank anyway so I was assigned captain but my concern like I'll be like you know I'll be like super um straightforward with you guys I'll be very transparent guys I don't want to be a captain I think I have to be because like in my head if you're assigned captain um um and if you're assigned captain it means like you know you have like because it's it's a pre-assigned team and um it's a pre-assigned team so i'm like why do we why do i have to be captain i know it's like it's just a title but i don't want the responsibility especially if it's a pre-assigned team i don't like responsibility if i if i have no say in in what happened so yeah so i did Email

27
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,970
asking can I like give up my captain spot because I don't feel come.

28
00:05:37,090 --> 00:06:03,090
I honestly, I just don't feel comfortable being a captain Um, I just don't feel comfortable being captain if there's no captain duties You know what I'm saying like I just I just wanted like like if there's no actual captain dude like I'm not drafting for players I'm not making the team It's just a name.

29
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:11,850
So I'm like, it's possible if I just, I don't want, because like, if anything happens to my team, people be like, Jokey Brain, and I just don't want that.

30
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,950
I don't want that.

31
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,630
If we get last place, they'll be like, oh, Jokey Brain.

32
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,610
I'm like, no.

33
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,270
I don't want, don't, don't leave your name out of your mouth.

34
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,550
Leave my name out of your mouth.

35
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,510
I've got nothing to do with this.

36
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:40,870
I don't know.

37
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,170
Matthew, Esther, thank you.

38
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:43,870
Super chat.

39
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,210
Thank you.

40
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,030
Thank you.

41
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,150
So humble.

42
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,670
We need a captain to keep it.

43
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,070
So that's like, sorry.

44
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,290
That's why I was late.

45
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,730
Because I was like asking like, can I give up my captain's spot?

46
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,050
I don't know.

47
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,970
Maybe there's just be like, no.

48
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,190
And I'll be like, okay.

49
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,510
I don't know.

50
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,770
You know, it doesn't hurt to ask it.

51
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:12,390
You know, it doesn't hurt to ask if it's okay.

52
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,710
But I don't know.

53
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,730
I feel like I feel like I'm still going to be captain.

54
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,510
But I'm just worried.

55
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,970
You know, I always get like super paranoid about these tournaments.

56
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,090
It's like a double-edged sword.

57
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,510
Because like there's so many support players.

58
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,290
I feel like.

59
00:07:32,090 --> 00:08:00,490
was like saying like um what i'm worried about is that they think i haven't even played the new season yet i haven't even played gambit i think if i was gambit maybe i can carry but the thing is it it's considered a four fun tournament but the literally first place is 7.5k thousand dollars like 7.5k dollars that's like even though it's four fun you know it's still a lot of money So it's not per person,

60
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:00,950
obviously.

61
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,290
It's divided by six.

62
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,250
But like, you know, everyone wins.

63
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,150
Every team, every, I mean, you have to.

64
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,790
You have to have prize money.

65
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:17,970
Like you can't, it's hard to make a for fun tournament, but also like make it fun for people to watch as well.

66
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,330
You know, because it's sponsored by Marvel Rivals.

67
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:25,650
It is sponsored by, you can't really blame them on that because like, you know, it puts more stake into it.

68
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,910
And it is sponsored by Marvel Rivals.

69
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:34,530
So of course you're going to like, you know, you know, put in sponsor money into the, like put a prize pool and everything because it's officially sponsored by them.

70
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,970
And it's like, you know, it helps motivate to people to, so it's hard.

71
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:43,250
You can't really, um, it's hard to make it for fun.

72
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,830
Like, you know, my apex tournament had prize money too.

73
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,030
And obviously people took it very seriously as well.

74
00:08:48,390 --> 00:09:52,950
Um, you know, I was trying to push the for fun angle on it, but you know, that's why I tried to balance it with like, you know, fun game modes where you don't really require aim, but it's hard to get people to participate if you don't have prize money and everything so it makes sense like you know you want to put more cred to your tournament so it makes sense to have to have a prize pool it like these tournaments always makes me so fucking scared and paranoid because like I don't know how it's gonna go cuz like I'm like first when I first looked at it I was like this seems pretty hard to balance cuz I'm like I don't know if this is unbalanced or not like I can see some teams that felt like maybe you swap a play like one or two players maybe it'll be better but like it's so hard to balance because 80 i think like 70 of the players okay it's one percent tank players if i'm being um honest it's one percent tank players 70 percent support players and um the rest are dps um and that is

75
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:58,470
already very hard to balance if you have that percentage of the 1%

76
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:25,140
you guys are gonna know I'm gonna notice because like a lot of people are gonna be off rolling right now like for this tournament um um Ultron is fucking bad right now guys Ultron's bad like it's all about Gambit it's all about whoever it's all if my team can play dive we would fucking roll everyone that's all I'm gonna say it might My team,

77
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,560
the thing is, I don't know if my team can play dive.

78
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,700
I don't know.

79
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:36,740
Like, it's either dive or mag.

80
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,960
But I haven't even tried out the new season, you know?

81
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,720
I don't know.

82
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,380
So, that's why I'm like, I'm so nervous.

83
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,260
Like, I hate being so nervous.

84
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,080
I was like so excited to be part of the, you know, the VTuber Cup.

85
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:58,220
I'm also like really really nervous because you know I don't that's why I don't want to be captain because there's so much uncertainty so I feel weird being captain because I'm like I don't know this is this is I don't know I think there's is like just from my experience looking at like knowing the gameplay of some of these players on here and like knowing like their skill level I feel like there is one team I know which team is gonna be first place it's not my team but other than that like that's the only team I know that's gonna be first place because they have a one above all DPS player um and that's the thing that's so hard to balance because like the only other one above all player is me but also i haven't i'm support

86
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:27,800
it's like it's so scary because it's like what can i do they play if they they play sidelog what can i do like i can't solo a one above all sidelog player like i'm just i'm just a little guy I mean, maybe with Gambit, but like I said, I haven't even played the new season yet.

87
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah, I'm just gonna heal real hard.

88
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:46,560
No, you can't, no, no, I will say it's easier to solo carry on DPS as in Marvel Rivals than it is in Overwatch.

89
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,980
In Overwatch, a lot of characters are more like, it's very hard to solo carry.

90
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,080
Back then, in Overwatch, you can solo carry a game easily.

91
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,040
Like, you can just play Widowmaker and hit, like, like, kill four people and then you win.

92
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,840
But now it's not.

93
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,680
Now it's a lot harder because all the tanks have 5,000 HP.

94
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,220
So it's a lot harder now.

95
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,400
Yeah, back then, you can do, like, you know, you can do Nanoblade and then bam, easy.

96
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,680
Or, like, Bayblade with Reaper and a Nanobust.

97
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,420
But now it's not like that.

98
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,220
Even if you have a Mercy Pocket, it's not that easy anymore in Overwatch.

99
00:13:22,280 --> 00:14:28,840
in rivals however it is very easy to solo carry as a dps all the way to celestial maybe even eternity honestly to eternity it's so easy if you have one pocket support on um and just gives you a snowflake or even a mantis damage boost or anything you can solo carry as a dps all the way to eternity um it's just that like it's like um as someone has played this it's like honestly like very easy to do now um especially because the reason why um that's not solo yeah but it's still it's okay duo maybe but you can still do it if you don't even have a pocket you still do it without the pocket you just need to know good players will know where all the health packs are located and because they know where all the health packs are located um they don't have to have a pocket support as long as they can know where the health packs are they can easily like as like flankers or maybe even hella honestly like i had games where i was like you know you guys have seen it before where i would play hella and

100
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:44,660
then i'd be in like fucking plat or gold elo and i don't play hella a lot and this was a long time ago and i was like playing hella and i literally like just killed pop pop pop headshot headshot headshot everyone's dead we go in like doesn't matter

101
00:14:48,160 --> 00:15:16,980
that don't position very well and then just go pop pop headshot two headshots they're dead and that's like yeah so like you can just click heads and and yeah it's just point and click that's the thing that's why like i'm most nerve like worried about most nervous but i'm trying to be like it's okay just just come down dokey it's it's for fun i just don't want to be captain i i don't want the responsibility of being captain.

102
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,520
But the thing is, I'm also a support player.

103
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,660
I don't really want to off-roll.

104
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,200
I'm not here to off-roll, too.

105
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,600
I just want to play support.

106
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,560
That's really it.

107
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,520
So, I don't know.

108
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:29,940
I don't know.

109
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,820
I think the teams are honestly going to say the same.

110
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,900
I think at best, if I could, just like, I just don't want the name of Calf.

111
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,880
I just don't want the title.

112
00:15:42,500 --> 00:16:15,800
So, like, you know, if we get last place at least they won't be like dokeybird like team dokeybird in fourth place because i i'd rather just like i like i would be on the team that's last place but please don't call my name out like just just don't call my name out like bro come on it's just it's a title come on i didn't even know i was gonna be captain you know what i just found out i was gonna be captain like like An hour ago!

113
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,360
I just, yeah, I just, I just don't like it.

114
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,180
It's just more like PTSD and trauma for me.

115
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,420
I just, I don't know.

116
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,900
It's just like, it's just like PTSD, I guess.

117
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,720
Like, I just don't like it.

118
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,120
It just gives me like, oh.

119
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,980
As long as team has fun, it shouldn't matter, right?

120
00:16:40,020 --> 00:17:51,280
The thing is, you can, I know like people are like, oh, it's not a team that's have fun, but Marvel Rivals is a hero shooter and like if one team is like a lot weaker than the other I don't know if this is balanced I can't tell so like I'm like I believe I believe in the balancing team because this is very hard to balance me looking at the me looking at the rules and um looking at the rules of what they have to you know work with it is definitely very hard to balance so i can understand like if they've been like trying to struggle trying to fucking find like um the best way to do this um and uh but yeah no like if there is a huge difference in skill level between teams obviously you can't really have fun if you're getting spawn camps someone said so like that's why like you know i'm glad i don't i'm not like you know i i'm glad i'm not in to do this because like I even like I'm like being like I don't know this is balanced I sent my email but like um if anything is it possible I'm just

121
00:17:51,280 --> 00:18:03,720
not the captain like and it's just like even I don't know because it's it's like I'm I'm like, how do you balance this?

122
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,460
Like,

123
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,060
like, uh, yeah, no, getting, no, if you, no, okay, you know what's the most tilting thing?

124
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,040
Getting killed by the same person five times in a row.

125
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,900
I don't want my team to feel that.

126
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:27,540
Like, I, I don't want my team to feel that, you know, like being killed by the same person five plus times in a row.

127
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,640
That's not fun.

128
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:30,820
Yeah.

129
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:31,760
Yeah.

130
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:59,480
so like and i feel bad you know the thing i feel bad about is that um the thing that i feel the most bad about is that obviously they're like oh joki you've been top 500 before but that was like you know i even wrote like it was the early season like season zero to one i've been top 500 before And it's because of that peak that I,

131
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,240
like, pull up my team's average because of it.

132
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:08,080
So they have to find weaker, you know, lower ranked teammates to balance it out.

133
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,960
So I feel really bad because all I can do is play support.

134
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,080
I don't even care.

135
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,340
Like, they're like, people, if I play ranked, they'll be like, do you play anything else?

136
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,320
And I'd be like, no.

137
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,620
Be like, no, you swap.

138
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,520
You know, I'm stubborn.

139
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,980
I don't fucking want to play anything else.

140
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:32,080
Like, so like, I haven't even touched the other roles in a very long time, so...

141
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm like, I don't care.

142
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,940
I'm just gonna, I'm still gonna play support.

143
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,580
I'll be like, and then they'll be like, oh, can you play tank?

144
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,220
I have zero hours in tank.

145
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,120
I can just say that.

146
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,920
And then they're like, okay, well, okay.

147
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,570
I, yeah.

148
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,970
Yeah, I have fun with support.

149
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:52,450
I do.

150
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,150
I enjoy.

151
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,090
I enjoy playing support in Rivals.

152
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:00,110
Um, so, yeah, um, I'm just nervous.

153
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,530
I'm really nervous about this event.

154
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,830
Ah, ah, I'm nervous.

155
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:08,890
I really am.

156
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,490
Um, uh, okay, wait, give me a sec.

157
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,070
Let me, oh, I don't mind if it's anyone in my team.

158
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,680
All right, here we go.

159
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,460
All right, um, No, I don't want to flex.

160
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,500
Because the thing is, when you're flexing, it has to be on tank.

161
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,860
And I don't fuck with that.

162
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,980
It's never DPS.

163
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:59,680
You can never flex on DPS because there's like 200 plus DPS players on my team.

164
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,860
It's never...

165
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,120
When you're flexing, it's never DPS.

166
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:03,760
It's tank.

167
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,860
I don't want that.

168
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,040
I will never be a tank player.

169
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,800
You can never get that out of me.

170
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,200
Also, am I lagging a little bit with my flex?

171
00:21:12,220 --> 00:22:09,180
it i can't tell i never yeah it's never a dps flex you know it also for those who don't know we didn't get nominated for uh marvel revvo streamer um i did cry i did cry a bit when because like i i stayed i like uh my managers like do work i was like no i'm watching them announce the nomination and then i got i was like ha ha i was so confident you know i was like oh my god silly dokey never go in with high expectations never go in with high expectations joki and then um i was so i was like hopeful and confident because i was like truly i'd get nominated right i was like i don't know i don't know why i thought i'd get a nominated uh that i was like getting ready to screenshot it on my phone as well because i was like i can't get work done uh to my manager because i was like i'm too busy like i have to know like it was like one hour before the stream and it had to wait

172
00:22:12,220 --> 00:23:13,580
forgot that flesh tubers um when not even flesh to but i think like twitch streamers for twitch streamers i'm so used to just like going live after my intro like i loop like two to three times sometimes you know you get like two or three loops and then i swap um and and you know like even then i was like oh your wait guys are waiting too long in the waiting like waiting screen but i forgot that like not just flesh toers but like twitch streamers um they're waiting can be like an hour long before the actual stream like i forgot people do that on twitch um not just like i said i've seen vtubers do it too they would like you know they want people to gather in first but i would like you know the stream started i waited i think like 40 plus minutes like 40 plus minutes before they started the stream um like because it was like starting stream you know the intro stream like the waiting like the starting stream title thing and then i waited 40 minutes and then they uh and then they started

173
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:42,140
announcing the nomination so i was obviously so antsy and everything um and so like you know i got i was like i got my phone ready to screenshot it and then i was like after the fifth name called i knew i wasn't gonna be in it after i heard the fifth name i was like i no i didn't make it i so then i obviously i started I just thought that,

174
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:49,160
you know, like, you know, people were like, oh, why are you so, why are you so like, um...

175
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,780
Put so much into this, like, oh, it's just a meaningless award.

176
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:57,340
The thing is, I put a lot of effort campaigning for it.

177
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:10,120
So, like, you know, and then it's like... I thought it'd be really cool, and it'd be really nice to be like, you know, a VTuber representative, because you don't see VTubers nominated outside of...

178
00:24:10,880 --> 00:25:03,560
see vtubers nominated outside of like the vtuber category so um so that's why like that's why i put so much like you know um expectations on myself for it and i thought this was like oh yeah this is like one of the categories that vtubers have a chance to like shine in because like i did so much on my rivals as a vtuber and like marvel sponsors me a lot in like uh sponsors me a lot for like their stuff and um you know they usually just pick me on the vtuber side and it's all flesh tubers um so you know i thought i you know i was like oh maybe there's a possibility there's a chance um and so that's why like you know i thought it'd be really cool i was like oh that'd be such good like representation you know be like look see a vtuber can like get on this category as well like get outside of the vtuber category because it doesn't happen very often like um i know like IRLS,

179
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:11,700
she has got nominated various things outside of either category, and it puts a lot of exposure to VTubers in general, because, you know, it's a normie.

180
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:20,320
Lots of normies watch this, like, the people that are nominated, also, like, it's the meta for streaming changed so much, it's mostly IRL streaming, it's crazy.

181
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:59,800
But, like, you know, it's also, like, you know, a lot of normies, and, like, you know, watch the streamer awards, and, like, especially, like, the good publicity in general um so that's why you know i felt really bad i felt really sad because i was like oh i can't believe i can i was like oh my gosh oh like you know i was like oh why did i thought i could do it like because you know i know a lot of it's not your guys fault i just think that you know youtubers are still um a niche it's like a huge niche and honestly i feel like it's more So,

182
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,200
like, oh, it's not because, like, okay, that's what pissed me off the most.

183
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:14,320
What the thing was pissing me off the most was that people on my tweets, you know, of course, you know, all my tweets being like, my community didn't show up or, like, your community just didn't vote for you.

184
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,100
And I was like, that's a fucking lie.

185
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,540
I know so many dragoons have voted me.

186
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:27,260
And I know a lot of, like, VTubers from different, um, a lot of VTubers outside of my circle were saying, no, vote for a dokeybird for Marvel rivals.

187
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,460
So I was like, there's, it's not my community.

188
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,360
not showing up.

189
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:37,680
It's not like, even the VTuber, like, the VTuber community even voted for me in Marvel Revivals.

190
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,640
Like, it wasn't just my community, too.

191
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,300
So, it's just because this is my theory.

192
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:53,040
It's just that, because I am not part of, like, I'm not, like, a normie streamer, and we're, like, VTubers, you know, like, it's still niche.

193
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:53,960
We're still very niche.

194
00:26:54,020 --> 00:27:01,460
We're part of a niche group within a niche group, because we're part of the anime group, and then within the...

195
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:18,700
And the thing is, like, a lot of these Normie streamers, like, Normie viewers, they'll be like, I don't know anyone in Marvel Rivals, but, hey, this guy, I've seen this guy play this game once, and he collabs with the streamer that I do like, and I know he plays Marvel Rivals,

196
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,200
so I'm gonna vote for him.

197
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,720
I think it's just that.

198
00:27:23,420 --> 00:28:25,200
They're just, like, you know, they're voting for their favorite norm, like, they're voting for their favorite blush tuber and they got to the Marvel rival categories and they'll be like I remember this oh yeah this guy this guy played with um this guy played with my favorite streamer one time and it was Marvel Rivals or like and I don't remember he she's Marvel Rivals I'm gonna vote for him too like I don't know what he actually does but I'm gonna vote for him because you know he he's like my favorite streamer's friend or like he he uh he's collabed with my favorite streamer and uh he so it's just that and and it's just like you know but obviously I don't know a lot of flesh tubers uh so obviously like and like flesh like a lot of flesh tuber viewers a lot of normies they don't really watch vtubers so it's just basically that I just think I just don't have the reach and I don't stream on Twitch that often too I know a lot of people are like oh you should do multi-streaming now you know

199
00:28:25,200 --> 00:29:49,180
like hololab is doing multi-streaming now um but like i feel so okay i don't know i know like i'm like i'm like um stagnating my growth by not streaming on twitch um and i know that i know i'm stagnating my growth by being so stubborn and splitting you know like doing twitch as an streams but like i hate the chat restrictions i hate it so much and like i saw like apparently also the rules are so um unclear because i saw like i saw someone i don't remember who it was it was a while ago that was like trying to warn the hollow live girls being like don't keep your don't keep two twitch chat don't keep youtube and twitch chat on the stream or like you could get banned and so poorly written you can apparently have both twitch chat streams on like both chats on your screen but they have to be divided like i don't know like they gotta be segregated like they cannot touch it's crazy so you can have both chats and they just can't touch they have to be on opposite sides of the screen yeah it's

200
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,540
fucking weird i

201
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:55,300
yeah so you have to have but and it can't be like you know like a little space between them it has to be actually like on the other side like it's so so because everyone thought that you can't have youtube chat on if you're doing multi-streaming on twitch but apparently the rules are so because that was like everyone would parrot that it'd be like everyone was parrots it and was like yeah um you can't have like you can't have them like like uh have both on the screen you only can only have twitch chat because like twitch will ban you if you have youtube chat on the screen because that's how vague the rules are that's how vague it is and um uh and then i found like No,

202
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,440
no, you can't have both chats.

203
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,000
They just can't be together.

204
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:08,320
They just have to be, like, very clearly separated so that you can't have them there.

205
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,640
Also, someone was like, oh, what about there's some streamers that have them merged.

206
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,580
Those streamers have a contract with Twitch that allows them to do that.

207
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,480
Because they don't want them to leave their platform.

208
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,700
So they have a contract where they can merge their chats.

209
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:50,980
um but they're very very picky on who gets that contract uh so um so there are some creators on twitch that can merge it but if you aren't like you know you're not one of those creators that have that contract obviously you can't do it um it's you know it's makes sense because like you don't want the streamer with 30 000 viewers leave your platform like like you want it to go to

210
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:47,540
no it's not just chat it's more so of like you know in the contractors a lot of like stipulations and a lot of like rules that you can bypass because you're like oh i want if you want me on your platform um you want me to stream on your platform like i'll do this and i would like this and this and this um because like i say i that's the one reason why i don't want to multi-stream because it's like it's ugly i don't want to have both chats on opposite sides of the screen It's so I would be like okay I mean if I could do something where like you know This this is like tiny like you know the YouTube chat is here And then the Twitch chat is like right under there Like that's fine I'm fine with that But the fact that I do two different chats on like different It's just it's screen color there I hate screen color there I just hate it like It just doesn't look good I mean I

211
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,540
No, it has to be, you have to be like, like very clearly separated and everything.

212
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,780
It's just, oh, that's what I hate.

213
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,340
That's what I hate.

214
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:08,220
I just like, they have to be like here and then the other one will have to be like very clearly not touching each other.

215
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,500
And I just, oh, it pisses me off.

216
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,160
There are a lot of years that do what you just said.

217
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,620
It's not allowed, though.

218
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,820
It's not, I was reading that thread.

219
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:25,440
I won't say it, but like, no snitching, no snitching though.

220
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:44,500
But I was reading that thread and people were saying, it's just, it's just more so like, as long as Twitch doesn't do anything to you, um, if one is going up and one is going, they can't touch as one is going up and one is going down.

221
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,760
Those are so fucking unclear.

222
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,580
I was reading the Twitter thread and I was looking at like, hololive.

223
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,060
And they didn't want to, like, get in trouble.

224
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,120
So they separated it in two different sides.

225
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,200
It's not so...

226
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,800
I was reading a thread and people were saying it's not supposed...

227
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,600
They can't touch.

228
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,320
People were saying that, too.

229
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,280
And, like, that's what I'm saying.

230
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,400
It's so unclear.

231
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,520
It's so fucking unclear.

232
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,540
Because, like, the...

233
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:16,000
And I know, like, you know, I don't want to fuck with Twitch.

234
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,680
They're so unclear.

235
00:34:23,400 --> 00:35:41,920
I feel like the rules need to be more clarified because I was reading the thread about it and then um and like people were saying that like yeah like they're not supposed to touch and I'm like okay but like even before then even before then it was like common knowledge where like twitch was like you can't you can't have youtube chat on stream on screen like i was like uh that's what they i just don't like having two chats on my screen because of the clutter it's just it already covers so much you know i play video games i do a lot of gaming streams um and like and like the thing is i try to minimize as much clutter as possible and i don't like that like the fact that you know twitch like the chat can having two chats can cover a lot up a lot of stuff yeah one chat is fun but having two it covers a lot of stuff that's on the screen when i already have myself on screen as well like no it's just because like you know that's what also is really hard about being a vtuber streamer it's

236
00:35:41,920 --> 00:36:14,580
because if you're doing like if you're a fleshtuber you can just shrink your uh you can just shrink your cam and stuff but like you know a lot of people like watching vtuber streamers for the vtuber on the screen and then that's already covering up like one fourth of the game and and then it's like oh yeah it's just uh just shrink yourself like What's the point?

237
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,440
I might as well not be on screen.

238
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:26,900
It's like those, like, I shrink myself and I'm like those like interpreter, like the hand sign interpreter people are like right on the bottom.

239
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,560
This will just shrink myself.

240
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,860
I'd be like, like the interpreter.

241
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:40,780
I'm doing my hand signs and doing like, oh, this is what she's saying.

242
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,960
Your ASL dokey right here.

243
00:36:50,540 --> 00:38:04,760
uh but yeah i know i should multi-stream i know i just i don't know i should suck up my integrity and pride i just wish the rules aren't so unclear because it's like now i'm finding out that apparently you can have uh both chats touch each other but like people were like arguing against that i was reading it up i was like oh uh because he can't look like it's merged so so it's like what if like are these rules that are actually like if twitch doesn't like you they'll give you like a suspension like stuff like that like i you know okay someone okay someone earlier was saying that um someone earlier uh when i streamed on twitch they were saying uh uh that like oh dokey you changed the description on your twitch because in my old description i was like i stream on youtube more follow me there and then when i found out holla i was doing multi streams i was gonna do multi streams on twitch or like not multi stream was joining twitch i had to read the guidelines um this was the same day i

244
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:15,360
saw someone tweeting out like trying to warn the hollow girls being like don't merge your chats or anything or don't have both chats on screen because that's against the rules which apparently isn't anymore like What the fuck?

245
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,180
Like, no.

246
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,780
Why are the rules so unclear?

247
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,280
Like, so then I reread the rules again.

248
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,860
Um, I reread the rules.

249
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:33,260
And, um, and then I found out you're not supposed to advertise a different platform to encourage viewers to come to that platform.

250
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,500
And I realized I've been breaking the rules for a very long time.

251
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,120
So I quickly changed it.

252
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,440
That

253
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,690
was the day I changed the description.

254
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,750
Because in there, it was like, you're not supposed to encourage.

255
00:38:49,770 --> 00:39:19,450
other your viewers to come come follow you on it I quickly changed it because I was like oh fuck okay I no and you didn't get punished for it I think I sort of did because one of the twitch staff unfriended me on discord and unfollowed me on Twitter they're just like I don't want to deal with you

256
00:39:25,050 --> 00:40:14,770
so yeah but that was a long time ago no it was before it was before like yeah it was it was a while ago I just didn't realize it until like a couple like a month or two ago I realized it because like my manager asked me something about like oh you have a twitch staff I could message about something and I was like yeah let me look up and I was like wait I can't find them discord friends list so so um no no they're still working there i think i saw their twitter so i was just like oh let me no problem let me find them on my discord friends list and i was like wait they're not my friends list anymore and i was like wait are you still following me on twitter i was like oh they're not following me on twitter anymore so i was like um

257
00:40:17,810 --> 00:41:41,650
that's awkward um i was like well i found their discord handle but um they removed me on discord so i don't know if they can help you for anything so uh so um good good luck uh uh um next see thank you for the super chat thank you thank you for what it's worth i do appreciate you just stream on youtube it's comfy but i won't blame you decide to dual stream i don't know i don't know i just i don't like um i personally just i'm not a fan of dual streaming but i know it i'm stagnating my growth by not dual streaming because like i said you know twitch is for any like english speaking streamers um youtube is more for um for like um you know for live streams it's more geared towards Asia um Twitch is for EU and NA and YouTube is for bots like it's for video uploads short form content it's not really for live oh my god okay so I was talking to Moxie and he was like oh he was like check he's like sharing screen with me and he's like I was like yeah no I she's like oh you don't I don't see on

258
00:41:41,650 --> 00:42:16,930
Twitch often I was like like went on YouTube went onto my channel and was like you don't have a lot of uploads I was like no you fucker it's on click live and he's like that's a thing that's a tab I was like oh my god you fucking yeah you go straight to videos because like that's what people normally do and it's like wait what there is a tab called for live like live I'm like yes you fuck That's my main platform.

259
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:20,990
Yeah, a lot of people don't know about YouTube live.

260
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,490
Mine is fucking blown.

261
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,690
Yeah, like.

262
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:37,490
So, so that, and it's a lot of people that don't know that.

263
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:43,970
A lot, especially a lot of normies that don't know that there is a live tab on YouTube.

264
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:56,290
Um, so, so that's why I know, I'm, I know I'm not like, I'm stunting my growth, but I hate it.

265
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,450
I hate it.

266
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,030
I hate it.

267
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:10,830
I hate the new meta is about these streaming because people are like, you, you, you know, are like, you are, you are not fucking over your career.

268
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,270
You are more so like, you are not taking advantage.

269
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:40,850
of the things of the things like the materials in front of you by uh by not multi-streaming and it's like ah I hate splitting viewerships too I hate it I hate it so much um I just want you know I just don't want to split viewerships too I just want everyone to be here with me in one area

270
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:46,210
I am a meta slave, though.

271
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,070
That's the worst part.

272
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,090
I'm a meta slave.

273
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:50,210
Let's see.

274
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,930
There is a fundamental brand where people have brand loyalty.

275
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:56,770
This is about the only noticeable difference.

276
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:57,470
Magic, thank you.

277
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:58,350
Super Chat, thank you.

278
00:43:58,690 --> 00:43:59,050
Thank you.

279
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:00,770
Crunch, thank you.

280
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:01,670
The Super Chat, thank you.

281
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:02,490
Thank you.

282
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,490
You're my favorite Marvelized streamer.

283
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:06,230
You inspired me as I've been in emotional slump.

284
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:07,090
And my room is cluttered.

285
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,050
I took your advice and started day by day.

286
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:09,510
Thank you.

287
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:09,690
Thank you.

288
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:10,430
Thank you.

289
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:10,710
Thank you.

290
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:14,610
I'm happy that, you know, you're taking the steps to feel better.

291
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:47,630
yourself really does mean a lot uh to help you with that um but yeah no like i said uh to go back with the whole mara rava's thing i i mentioned i hated that like like you know the randoms were like you know blaming you guys it was fucking pissed me off like i didn't care i like after the you know not knowing knowing that i didn't get nominated i literally played fortnite through two hours later like i i was okay you know i was sad you know as i should be because like um I did spend a lot of time campaigning.

292
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,690
I spent a lot of time campaigning.

293
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:54,030
And I also did bonus streams late at night.

294
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:56,870
You know, when I was already so busy.

295
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:58,350
I was already so busy.

296
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:04,190
And I did do bonus rival streams late at night.

297
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,730
So it wasn't like I didn't try.

298
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:08,570
I think I felt like I did try.

299
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:39,870
And so obviously, you know, that's why people are like, why are you so sad about this meaningless award why are you like because i put so much time and effort even though you guys might some of you guys might think it's meaningless i still you know i still put effort into trying to campaign so it you know in my in my head i feel like oh i've wasted so much time i could have if i knew like you know it wasn't possible i wouldn't have you took that time

300
00:45:43,230 --> 00:47:17,590
you know like so that's why i didn't think you i personally didn't think it's meaningless i thought like you know um it was it would have been nice to you know be able to have a vtuber outside of the vtuber category um in one of those spots um and then okay another thing that i felt like i was getting rage baited um was that um like people were like oh someone was like you didn't even tweet about it that's a fucking lie someone that was following me i i held my tongue was like i looked at her twitter and she didn't even tweet about uh um asking for a vote if anything my tweet had the most likes out of all the nominees that asked for a vote so don't fuck with me right because vtuber fans love Twitter they love interacting with Twitter normies for some reason don't I was like normies don't interact with Twitter but VTuber fans fucking love interacting with Twitter don't fuck with me yeah like and then someone else that that um yeah because we're chronically online because that's how we

301
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:40,930
fucking were able to interact with our favorite anime person like real normies maybe they'll go out the street and be like oh my god there's there's kaisenad walking in target you can catch them but you know how only we can see our favorite anime girl or boy online so we have to be chronically online like

302
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:50,270
He can look outside and then you'd be like, oh my god, there's speed doing his running shit.

303
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,630
I don't fucking know.

304
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:51,890
Like

305
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:46,290
And then another thing, another thing that, um, um, that like fucked with rage baited me, but I, but I had to say it because i was like i know i'm like oh i'm fine i'm like after that but i have to talk about it was that uh i remember reading not even just one person multiple people were like oh it's just because you didn't stream enough marva rivals all the other nominees um um streamed more than you and i was just like okay and then i was like don't oh don't pull that card if anything half the nominees streamed it when they were sponsored.

306
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:48,310
Don't fuck with me.

307
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:51,610
Like, and like, I won't say half.

308
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,570
Maybe like, like one or two.

309
00:48:54,050 --> 00:49:03,210
And then like, I know like one, another one, they like, basically, they like, um, they, they stream it.

310
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:05,510
They do stream it, but they don't like stream it.

311
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:06,590
They are variety.

312
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:10,990
One or two of them are just variety and rivals is their variety stream.

313
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:12,930
You know who else does that?

314
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:52,410
you know I'm considered a variety streamer but I do stream rivals a lot as well I even play rivals off stream so I was like you cannot so like I'm just like oh my god like when I saw like several people's commenting that I was like no you do know that didn't know me being a variety streamer doesn't fucking put me out of the running because I still consistently stream rivals outside of being sponsored.

315
00:49:54,750 --> 00:50:03,110
But they're like implying that like the nominees weren't also variety streamers?

316
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:10,710
Like I was like, if anything I think Bougar's the only pure rival streamer in the nominations.

317
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:23,610
So I was just like, I was just like, no, no, no, no, no.

318
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:33,770
I'm pretty sure like three of them have the same consistency as me in terms of like variety and streaming rivals.

319
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:45,440
So that's why I was just like, um that's why i was like you can't use that argument for me

320
00:50:48,490 --> 00:51:07,530
i even play off stream like i'm just like bro i that's how i'm like bro i'm so i'm in so deep i play off stream like have you ever seen tim play off stream bro he has a family to take care of he's not fucked up like me like

321
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:36,470
he has a life outside like he ain't fucked up like me I play off I play rivals at three in the morning off stream I ain't here to make content out of it I actually just purely enjoy the game like I purely enjoy the game so much that I will not sleep to play rivals at three in the morning I have a problem please understand like

322
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:42,050
He's very healthy.

323
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,450
Yo, I had so many people.

324
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:49,170
I bumped into...

325
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:53,270
While I was playing off stream, not at a degenerate hour.

326
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:55,570
Actually, at like, you know, 12 p.m.

327
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:56,330
or some shit.

328
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,010
Like, 12 or 1 p.m.

329
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:59,870
I bumped into...

330
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:00,970
What's his name?

331
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:01,970
The org that left.

332
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:05,090
By the way, 100 Thieves left the Marvel Rivals.

333
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:06,810
Didn't leave the Marvel Rivals.

334
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:10,690
For those who do follow Esports, 100 Thieves didn't leave the Marvel Rivals scene.

335
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:37,130
They're just they just didn't want to pay I think they just didn't want to play paid a roster before the new league was announced because if they still have Here's a little like esport like knowledge for you guys like business knowledge like Net ease slash rivals haven't announced the new league yet but there's no tournaments until 2026

336
00:52:40,710 --> 00:53:14,710
org because that's you know they're all losing money you know like majority of esports orgs aren't making money um and you know you know they don't want to pay their teams it's you know they have to pay them monthly you know so it's easier to not to kick you know to drop their team and wait until the 2026 league is announced and then recruit a new team That's at least four months of not paying wages.

337
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:23,790
Like, so that's why they dropped their team.

338
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:29,850
Because why the fuck would they pay the roster money when there's no tournaments to enter?

339
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:36,970
Like, it's messed up.

340
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,250
But esports orgs are not making money.

341
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,330
Except for, like, that 1%.

342
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:56,950
I think the only, I'm pretty sure, um, the, the, the, the only esport org that I'm very confident in, that is making an actual profit is T1.

343
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:01,110
Purely off of Faker.

344
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:02,230
That's it.

345
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:03,950
Purely off of Faker.

346
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:08,790
That's the only esport org that full confidence is making actual income.

347
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,230
And, and.

348
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:34,530
Nothing else I feel like I feel like I feel like T1's the only org Um Um So yeah So anyway Back to my story Uh Back to my story Uh I was like 12 to 1 p.m.

349
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:40,090
And um Uh Uh

350
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:53,830
let's see oh yeah i'm not captain thank god

351
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:12,530
yeah i don't get to be capped sorry no i just got the message they're like you don't have to be captain like thank god i don't i don't care they're like oh it'd be more publicity if you're like Team Doki brand.

352
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:25,950
I don't care Me already being in that team everyone knows who I am I don't need to be like you don't have to like push my name out there Like anyone that's watching for Marva rivals already knows my name.

353
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:33,050
It's fine Like I'm that much of a degenerate for this game like on the VTuber side.

354
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:39,270
I think everyone's aware Yay dodging responsibility.

355
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:40,570
Yeah

356
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:50,570
I just don't want them to be like, oh, Team Doki Braid, Lost.

357
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:53,410
I just don't want people to say that.

358
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:59,010
Like, I'm just here for the ride.

359
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:01,550
I don't want to be on the driver's seat.

360
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:06,970
Anyway, my story, my story.

361
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:07,690
Basically,

362
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:15,470
Uh, uh, so I bumped into, who is it?

363
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:18,030
Delena.

364
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:21,630
Sorry, I was like, do I remember the name?

365
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:23,610
I was like, one of the PS players.

366
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:26,390
It was like, is I heard Delena or Terra?

367
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:27,770
But I remember it was Delena.

368
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:31,690
Um, because he's the, uh, because I remember it was Delena.

369
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:34,450
Anyway, I bumped into Delena in rank.

370
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:36,330
Also, me, thank you for the 20 gift of ships.

371
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:37,350
Thank you, thank you.

372
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:45,150
And, um, I was like, Oh, oh, and in Delena, I was, I pulled up his stream.

373
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:46,970
He's part of a hundred thieves.

374
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:54,450
For those who don't follow esports, he is part of a hundred thieves, and they are known as the best team in NA, but they got fourth.

375
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:55,890
Was it third?

376
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:59,030
Or it was, was it third or fourth?

377
00:56:59,170 --> 00:56:59,690
I don't remember.

378
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:01,350
They are the best team in NA.

379
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:04,550
But, you know, EU fucked NA hard.

380
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:08,810
So it doesn't matter because EU fucked NA.

381
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:41,750
a challenge too that's the worst part like i was so ahead of na like it was not even it was so sad it wasn't even a goddamn challenge like it was just three oh done like oh sorry um all right oh fly quest was the okay but under these one first in the na tournament um but In the world,

382
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:43,050
land, they were fourth place.

383
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,290
Black Quest got third because meta favored them.

384
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:48,330
Because the thing is, for those who don't follow Marvel Rivals meta, I'm sorry.

385
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:49,950
I'm info dumping you guys so hard.

386
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:51,350
People are like, I don't care about Marvel Rivals.

387
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:55,030
But this entire stream was one hour of me talking about Marvel Rivals.

388
00:57:55,850 --> 00:58:04,230
But basically, the thing is, after the NA tournament, meta, like, they had to play on the new season patch.

389
00:58:05,110 --> 00:59:22,910
So because of they had to play on the new season patch, the meta from the NA tournament fully shifted in the world tournament so they only had i think like one month to prep for the new meta so like you know that's not a lot of time so they had one month to learn the entirely new meta i think was less than that was it like only three weeks it was like two to three weeks maybe yeah it was like two to three weeks between not even one month it was like two to three weeks to learn an entire new meta with a new with some new hero pools maybe like not you know your tanks or dps or supports not their strongest hero pools um going into the one million dollar land um because how's that different than the others because it may dive a lot stronger the new meta made dive so fucking strong because for those who don't know the new meta was that they buffed venom for those who forgot they heavily buffed majority of the dive characters and they released daredevil so na has been practicing non-dive for

390
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:32,910
the entire time but in eu they've always been playing dive So, for them, there was like, you know, it's nothing changed for them in general.

391
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:42,250
So, in NA, they all don't know how to learn Dive in time in two to three weeks, going in to a $1 million land.

392
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:47,730
And the best Venom players in the world are all EU players.

393
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:49,250
That's the thing.

394
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:57,490
The best Captain America, the best Venom player, the best Angelo player, we're all European.

395
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,630
were the European pros.

396
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:13,710
So I would say the best non-dive kit, the best, you know, the stationary tanks, you know, the best mag, the best strange, the best Emma, those were NA.

397
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:15,590
But that doesn't matter.

398
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:19,930
Yeah, the best captain, captain Europe, basically.

399
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,710
No, captain Europe.

400
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:23,190
It was literally captain Europe.

401
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:27,170
So all the best stationary tanks were NA.

402
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:30,230
And all the best dive tanks were European.

403
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:34,310
But the $1 million land was literally dive.

404
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:36,410
Like, it was dive meta.

405
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:37,650
So, like, they can't.

406
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:43,250
And the thing is, they're like, oh, why don't you just replace the players in time for the roster's were locked since the beginning.

407
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:47,410
So it's not like you can poach someone for the million dollar land.

408
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:52,670
Because the roster is locked before the first tournament.

409
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,970
It was before the first tournament even started.

410
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,950
The regional tournaments, like NA tournament.

411
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,730
European tournament, Asia tournament, the rosters are fully locked.

412
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:06,130
You can't change the roster until the end of the season, which is after the million dollar world tournament.

413
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:09,330
So, you know, and it was pretty much fucked.

414
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:13,670
Like, it was so sad.

415
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:15,130
I watched the land.

416
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:16,470
I was so bored.

417
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:17,670
I'm sorry.

418
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:27,070
Like, because it was literally, even like the two best European teams, like, it was a 3-1 during, like, first versus second.

419
01:01:27,070 --> 01:02:33,050
that was like because like the best dive players were all on the first place team so I was it was literally like 3-1 and um and like I was just like okay it was so it was one-sided as hell like it was not like it was like it was so fucking one-sided there was no actual fight like you know who's if the second place team even put up much of a fight like the saddest part was there was no fight there was no actual like you'll be like fight back no they're dead like not like half of them are in a coma right now and half are like dead like so so anyway back to my original story now explain sorry you guys needed a con you guys didn't need the context of you fucking n a hard but like i just wanted to tell you guys like what it was like and what it might be like too um

420
01:02:37,730 --> 01:03:38,030
um um anyway back to my original story of like how much of a degenerate i am um um i bumped into delena who's his 100 thieves and i pulled up his snow because they were streaming he was streaming with like another pro player uh but they were both solo because you know like like i'd say it's such a weird twitch meta now where like even though you're not streaming streaming together like you're actually you're not like playing together a lot of the smaller streamers they do the stream together just so they can combine all their viewerships together to be on the top of the twitch page and twitch category is very smart but it fucks with commute interaction i think it's smart but also the downside of it is that like you get no community and you don't get a community because you're not interacting with chat because everybody's chat is combined so how the fuck are you gonna read your own chat then like you know your chat has to read everyone else's chats too so you're not building your

421
01:03:38,030 --> 01:04:48,870
community but um it's not cynical because like how can you you know how can you build your community if you don't have your community um so um so so like thing is they all combine it too so i don't know why they do they all combine i think they combine it to make their chat look active um you know because they'll be like oh why does it say this much viewership they do it to like make it so their chat uh chat looks very active so um anyway sorry that's not even part of the original story anyway bumped into delena back to the original story and um he like randomly he was like he was i was watching navad because i was like oh hey delena we lost obviously um because like we had someone throwing on our team i don't remember what was going on but you know um i am an e-o-m-m um terrorist so like it like it just follows me so at that point i'm not even like surprised that we had someone throwing anyway um and you realize then elena try to add me uh to invite me to play um because i've never

422
01:04:48,870 --> 01:05:55,390
talked to him before um the one interaction i had was when i also got him in a game on stream and then he started throwing and i was i was like because but before he started throwing sorry this is another tangent you guys might remember the story like remember the stream but i got delena in my game like a long time ago and um i was like look guys it's delena from 100 thieves and delena was like is that the real dokey bird and i said nothing and then he swapped the squirrel girl and started throwing and i was like guys i should have told him i am the real dokey bird like i was like him so he wouldn't throw like and then i think and then he realized i was the real bogeybird and then he like he like swat back to um he swat back to like a real dps character uh and then that was my and then he went into my chat and was like we should play together so now i was like yeah sure add me and that was like four months ago so that was like the last interaction that was the only first and only

423
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:58,070
interaction I've had with Delano.

424
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:03,390
Anyway, fast forward to like last week, bumped into him again.

425
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:12,570
And then obviously I wasn't streaming because I play for the love of the game, not because I want to just make, like, you know, just not because I want to have to stream it or anything.

426
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:14,630
I actually enjoy playing this game off stream.

427
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:26,130
I looked at his chat because after the game, I looked at his chat and then I was, I was AFK and I came back and then I saw his chat wanted to see like, oh, did you say anything?

428
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:27,830
Did he notice I was in his game?

429
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:39,450
And, um, and, um, in the chat, they're like, oh, Doki Bird, uh, Doki Bird, uh, what is it called?

430
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:42,750
What's that lingo people use nowadays when, oh, don't know Waldo.

431
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:44,710
I was like, what does that Twitch lingo?

432
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:47,590
Um, they're like, wow, I can't believe Doki Bird don't know Waldo.

433
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:49,950
Or like, yeah, she doesn't acknowledge you, bro.

434
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:50,650
And I was like, what?

435
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:51,690
I was so confused.

436
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:52,630
I was like, what the fuck?

437
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:55,250
I didn't They didn't even ask me.

438
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:56,610
They didn't even say anything to me.

439
01:06:57,050 --> 01:07:02,830
And apparently, Don't Know What Means like, they, like, try to talk to you, but you ignore them.

440
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:06,810
So, like, so they don't talk, like, you don't talk to them until you don't.

441
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:08,410
I think it's like they don't talk to you.

442
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:12,330
They're, like, trying to imply that they don't acknowledge you unless you give money to them.

443
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:14,850
I think that's what that means.

444
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:22,190
And you know that I don't Don't Know What, you guys, because I'm literally interacting with all of you guys, and I don't have a super chat right now.

445
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:52,650

449
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:35,330

Sometimes donut seems to hurt your chances of being noticed.

494
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:43,650
Thank you for the super chat.

495
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:43,870

Thank you.

501
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:53,810
Anyway, I think that's really all there is about...

502
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:57,230
Um...

503
01:09:58,030 --> 01:09:58,470
Um...

504
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:03,510
Sorry, I had to reread the message right now.

505
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:05,310
But that's really all about my rivals.

506
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:05,870
We're over.

507
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:07,410
The rivals tangent is done.

508
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:08,850
What if I just play rivals right now?

509
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:10,310
But I won't do that to you guys yet.

510
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:15,690
The big story.

511
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:16,510
Okay.

512
01:10:17,330 --> 01:11:46,510
okay oh my god i fucking hate my bank i wish i could call them out but i can't yeah because it's a very canadian specific bank oh god i fucking i know like some people if you're a canadian i feel like some guys already sort of know which bank it is because there's only one really fucking terrible canadian bank and i'm definitely okay i'll tell you i'll give you guys this context um my mom picked this bank um because she knew it was a bad bank and like so so like she was like she wanted to take advantage of that and like disgusting and anyway so um I didn't realize how bad of a bank um this particular bank was until all the problems um all the problems showed up handle this like so um you know after i started living on my own and taking back my own business um i really i because i didn't because like my mom handled controlled the banks she controlled the business and um so i didn't realize how bad this bank was until i took retook over my entire um a year or plus ago so and like started

513
01:11:46,510 --> 01:12:55,290
living on my own and then i oh my god i cannot wait for me to leave this bank i oh i'm oh my god okay so anyway i have to go through so much shit no she just took control over the business and my bank like the bank the business bank account uh because she was the one that opened um she was the one that opened um um the business bank account um like she was in charge of it and um and she picked this bank so god i hate this bank by the way i know i keep saying it but bro it's so fucking bad i'm gonna tell you why this new story you guys already know so many stories about this bank um uh ashram thank you for the five gift of ships thank you thing the thing is when i took over the um when i took over this my business again and also the bank accounts um i created a new business bank account under a new business name you know because i wanted to like you know i wanted to go clean slate like you know this is my own business um my parents are not involved in this this is my own and i went with

514
01:12:55,290 --> 01:13:10,350
the same bank because i didn't realize how fucking bad it was because i was like well my parents my mom picked this bank so clearly she knew what she was doing so um i might as well go with the same bank so because There shouldn't be any problems.

515
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:12,550
I was so fucking wrong.

516
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:15,830
There were so many problems.

517
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:21,590
Because I didn't realize how bad it was.

518
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:24,010
Until I had to take over it.

519
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:26,870
But it was so late.

520
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:28,910
I already made a new bank account.

521
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:32,970
With my new business underneath this particular bank.

522
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:35,070
But yes.

523
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:36,770
Some of the Canadians.

524
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:38,950
Who know about the worst bank in Canada.

525
01:13:39,030 --> 01:15:09,310
know exactly which bank it is because there's only one really bad bank in Canada like one exceptionally terrible bank in Canada and so anyway so today I had to call them because i'm tired of doing wire transfers by going to the branch because every other fucking bank in the world does not require you to go to travel to the branch to do wire transfers um and so i was like obviously uh maybe uh maybe you know i'm gonna call them because like i was talking to my manager about this because like they're like okay you have to pay this person you have to pay that person and i was like and they're like did you pay this person yet i was like no because i have to walk over to the bank um to i have to do like a like a really long walk to the bank to do it and i don't want to do it for one wire transfer so i'm waiting for it to all build up until and then i go there and i just do like four to five wire transfers um at Like,

526
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:13,230
you know, because I don't want to fucking, you know, just do it one at a time.

527
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:16,450
So, they're like, what the fuck?

528
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:20,370
So my match is like, what the fuck?

529
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:24,930
Because, like, you know, like, he knows it.

530
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:25,750
He knows I have to do it.

531
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:29,330
He's like, he still can't, he still can't wrap his head around.

532
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:31,830
Because I've told this to him multiple times.

533
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:35,230
But he still can't wrap it around in his head.

534
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:39,250
that I have to walk over there to do the wire transfer.

535
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:40,970
And I was like, what, isn't that not how...

536
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:46,350
Like, when I first told him this, he's like, I was like, isn't that how all banks do that?

537
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:47,670
And he's like, no.

538
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:51,110
He's like, no.

539
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:51,710
What the...

540
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:52,930
Yeah, in the 70s.

541
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:53,690
Like, yeah.

542
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:59,010
He's like, I don't know, in the fucking 70s?

543
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:00,810
Like, it's 2025.

544
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:03,530
Like...

545
01:16:06,530 --> 01:17:22,190
so you're like yeah maybe 30 years ago maybe but like not now like everyone's things did it i was like what i was like no that's not true they don't they don't defeat i asked so mid they're like you gotta go to the branch to do your wire transfers and no i'm not talking about e-transverse i meant wire transfer international wire Bansfers that cannot do Online apparently And then like When I pay like Americans Like they were like Just do it online Here's their information And I was like I have to walk to Sorry I have to figure like Oh can you not send the payment Like today I was like No I have to walk to the branch And it's like 9pm now And it's closed And they're like obviously Like my American My American people that pay they're like what the fuck do you mean like just do it online like no i can't do that the bank is closed i can't i can't just like i'm sorry the bank is closed or i'll be like i'm sorry it's sunday so i'm sorry sir it's sunday i can't i i have to wait until after

546
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:29,590
sunday to go to the bank to do this wire transfer i can't do it it's closed like

547
01:17:34,430 --> 01:18:42,090
so um so anyway uh I was like I like called them today because I was like I can't keep doing this I can't keep walking it to the bank um I can't keep walking to the bank to like make a uh wire transfer like it's just not convenient in or like it's just it's so un it's so unorthodox of him to do so no Canada is so fucking weird with technology they're like they're like I I swear to God there's so much bureaucracy in Canada and like there's so much bureaucracy in Canada and like so many hoops to jump through I feel like I am not living in the 21st century like like it's just canada it's literally just canadian things

548
01:18:46,910 --> 01:19:57,570
so um anyway um so i called i called my mink and now it's just like i called my branch and i was like so i like i really want to like uh want to know like i have to um i have okay i lied by the way i had so i called my bank and i started lying and i was like oh i have to go out of country um in like um in like a month or two and um i have to go to the states and the thing is um um this bank bank branch is gonna be very far away to where i have to where you know where i have to be stationed for my business trip um and i'll be staying there for like a couple of months so i was just wondering if there is a way because if i say like oh i want to do wire transfers why i live close by in canada they'll be like oh i'm sorry ma'am just go to the nearest T.

549
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:09,980
I'm sorry, a lot of rage came in.

550
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:19,330
Sorry, just go to the nearest bank branch.

551
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:30,170
Sorry, I said, just go to the I'm sorry to say the newest bank branch.

552
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:34,370
And then you'll be fine, because, you know, it's Canada.

553
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:35,470
It's Canada.

554
01:20:36,190 --> 01:20:38,550
And I said the bank, the Canadian.

555
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:54,210
bank anyway yeah i was trying to say the bank anyway um anyway just yeah so

556
01:20:59,030 --> 01:22:32,210
as i was saying um so obviously i had to make up a scenario like figure out what the fuck to do for the wide transfer and so sorry my Canadian accent went really strong there um so I was saying like oh like in one to two months I have a business trip where I have to be in the States for a while so I was wondering um like the closest uh bank um like the closest branch of your bank is not that close to me um so i have a lot of important wire transfers i have to make for my business so i was wondering like uh i was what i used to work for this yeah it was bad i it was so bad it's it still is um anyway i was wondering if there is your way to do this wire transfer because i don't want to travel an hour or two away to an hour or two away to do this wire transfer you know obviously but like they'll do like no i just don't want to walk like i just didn't walk like um several walks to this goddamn fucking bank like in general even though the walk is like less than 30 minutes i don't fucking

557
01:22:32,210 --> 01:23:59,130
want to walk there like does no I'm actually still going to be in Canada um anyway so the guy he was like oh we have something called the global money transfer um and you can do that online or on your app and I was like oh really and he was like yeah it's called the global money transfer and um your account should be able to do it and you can do it online and it's really simple just check it up on your app or on your pc and i was like can't be that easy like surely can't be that easy so i was like okay sure all right thank you and then you know stupid me um instead of you know trying it out Dad I ate dinner the the bank is closed I got on my PC and looked for a global money transfer for my bank I logged into my bank account I clicked on the option global money transfer

558
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:35,490
I see your account is not eligible for global money transfer you are a small business account please go to wire transfer to see how you can do wire transfer and by the way when I call my branch they are very aware that my account is a small business account and they still recommended me global money transfer

559
01:24:46,270 --> 01:25:03,990
so so i'm like thinking why the fuck did you recommended me When you know damn well, my account is not eligible.

560
01:25:09,630 --> 01:25:11,730
So, I don't know.

561
01:25:12,130 --> 01:25:13,510
I don't know what to do.

562
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:16,390
I don't fucking know what to do.

563
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:19,110
I don't know.

564
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:21,270
Maybe I'll call them tomorrow.

565
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:22,970
I don't fucking know.

566
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:26,850
By the way...

567
01:25:30,730 --> 01:26:26,150
by the way here's a little other fun fact that my bank told me because I was like oh I'm going to be in the States and like maybe in a month or two for a business trip and they were like oh yeah um we can't really help you when you're in the States by the way man because um our bank in America we have branches there it's not owned by us it's owned by the united states so like it's actually a different um company that operates um our the banks there so like we can't really help you much for your canadian accounts if you're gonna be using the american branch side of our bank and i'm like are you fucking kidding me what what do you mean then why are they called

568
01:26:30,210 --> 01:27:05,580
by the canadian Inside it's owned by the America and it's apparently a fully different or Corporation that runs the American side Like I was like you have the same name and logo Like I was like what do you mean they get so if I go to the American Branch of this particular bank,

569
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:16,840
they will not be able to assist me on my Canadian accounts because they do not have the, oh my god, what's the word?

570
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:25,700
They do not have the access to it because they are the American branch side and it's owned by a different corporation.

571
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:43,420
They don't have the authority to access or the infrastructure to access my account in chat, like my Canadian account.

572
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:45,480
And I'm like, what?

573
01:27:51,690 --> 01:28:17,870
And then, and then they were like, also, um, ma'am, if, um, if we have to send you anything, like new cards or, uh, They're like, we need to send you anything like new cards or new credit cards or any banking information via mail.

574
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:25,570
We won't be able to send it to you at your American address or any of the American branches.

575
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:34,170
Because like we said, we have no affiliation with the American side of our bank because it is owned by a different corporation.

576
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:44,230
And, um, you'll only be able to pick it up when you're back in Canada.

577
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:51,200
And I was just like, what if I'm staying there for that?

578
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,580
What am I going to do with my business?

579
01:28:54,040 --> 01:29:09,660
Like, I'm just like, because I'm just like, actual Skinwalker Bay.

580
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:27,840
So I'm just like, what would I do if I had to, like, go on a business trip for, like, I don't know, half a year, like, in not even just the States, but just, like, somewhere else in the world?

581
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:30,380
Like, what the fuck am I gonna do?

582
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:34,600
Like, that's not a big...

583
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:39,240
I was like, it's so inconvenient.

584
01:29:41,260 --> 01:30:51,300
you know which bank I miss HSBC I miss them I miss HSBC so much they treated me like a queen they oh my god HSBC in a royal bank treated me like a fucking queen oh my god oh because like hsbc got bought by royal bank so they they stopped existing in canada i don't know they're still around i know like majority um majority of the hsbc bank for those who don't know hsbc it's a hong kong uh bank um but majority of HSBC banks in Canada got bought off by Royal Bank and then like my account got transferred to my HSBC account got transferred to the Royal Bank account.

585
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:58,200
I still have my Royal Bank account but they they treated me like a fucking queen.

586
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,240

All right.

590
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:18,240
But, no, it's the Royal Bank of Canada.

591
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,740
I assume that's what the RBC means.

592
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:21,900
Let me double check.

593
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,500
All right, yeah, Royal Bank of Canada.

594
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:32,020
I'm willing to call out Royal Bank of Canada because they've always treated me right.

595
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:36,340
They've never fucked with me.

596
01:32:39,520 --> 01:33:06,260
They've always been so nice to me Like For those who are like wondering like Oh man Like what the fuck is wrong with cat Let me tell you a story About one time I Had to deal I had to deal With Canadian With Canadian airport

597
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:38,460
this was a long time this was a while ago but it was when um this was a long time ago um when like uh we were trying to like um this was not with dad this was for another like our older other dog And we had to like, we had to like fly us and our dog to like,

598
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:40,080
I think it was to the States.

599
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:41,260
No, no.

600
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:43,840
It was, oh my God, it wasn't even to the states.

601
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:45,040
It was like somewhere in Canada.

602
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:48,920
We had to fly to somewhere in Canada and we had to bring our other dog.

603
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:52,820
And it was a, it was a weaner dog too.

604
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:59,720
And we brought, we wanted to bring, put him in like the sitting seat and everything.

605
01:33:59,740 --> 01:35:21,540
thing um wanted to bring him in with the um like you know put him under the like the sitting area instead of like down there in the in the storage for the bags so you know we brought our little our dog carrier but there's a lot of rules for the play and the thing is um with these rules they're like we won't let you we the carry has to be this size the carry has to be this size and also um but it has to be big enough for your dog but it has to be this size the thing is so we bought this carrier that we thought that was good size requirement for our dog and we're like this should be good because there's enough space for him and also it seems all right so we brought it along and then everything seems fine until the manager came over and was like your carrier's too big and we're like what and they're like what kind of dog is it and they looked at it and they're like oh he's gonna be you need a smaller carrier but if you get a smaller carrier for him he's too long for it so it's not

606
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:35,920
comfortable so we cannot accept this Because whatever size, even if you get the correct carrier, the size carrier, um, he, the dog is too long for it.

607
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:51,620
Like, so, I was, obviously, my parents and I, we were so confused, eh, because we were like, but this is, this is a normal carrier that we bought in Ikea, like,

608
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:59,880
Yeah, the dog was too long because he was a weiner dog.

609
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:04,620
So we bought like anything shorter because the carrier was just too long.

610
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:07,880
So we bought everything shorter.

611
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:13,280
He will not be able to like stand in it.

612
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:18,120
Like he won't be able to like stand stretched out in it because he's just too long.

613
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:25,160
So they're like, um, so then we had that.

614
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:56,740
the the cabin the cabin so so they're like you have to we you have to go out and buy a those like the metal the candle we have to put our dog like we were trying to avoid putting our dog in the baggage storage because like you know we don't know how he's like we we were scared i was gonna give him trauma because like i assume it's gonna be really cold and really loud so we wanted to go small dog.

615
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:01,660
So we wanted to go with the carrier option.

616
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:05,640
And they were like, yeah, we sold out of kennels.

617
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:14,100
So you're going to have to go out to New Year's pet store and buy a kennel for him.

618
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:17,140
It doesn't matter what size, as long as he's comfortable.

619
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:23,520
So it's just like, but after all of that, we were, they're like, okay, everything's fine.

620
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:24,460
You can check in now.

621
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:49,340
And this was a night flight okay for those who don't know in in the um in the uh bubu bubu the the security sector they close at around i think like they close at night so i don't remember it was like 11 so long ago i don't remember it was like 11 30 or 10 30.

622
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:52,500
so the thing is i think it was 11 30.

623
01:37:55,320 --> 01:38:00,440
so It doesn't matter if, like, you know, the flight is, like, 12.

624
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:01,480
Oh, I think it's 10.30.

625
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,360
I think it's 10.30.

626
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:07,040
Because, so they're like, it doesn't matter if your flight is, like, midnight or anything.

627
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:08,360
It doesn't matter.

628
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:12,100
Like, the security closes at 10.30.

629
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:14,880
So you have to get past it before 10.30.

630
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:23,780
So, so, I was like, I was like, oh, we're all so early.

631
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:33,480
be able to make it in time and also grab dinner i'm so hungry

632
01:38:36,640 --> 01:39:20,920
so so we're like you know an hour plus early and i was like yippee we're gonna grab dinner and then we you know we had to do a lot like whoever if any to anyone that has ever um shift their pet in a kennel um on a plane trip uh never have hope so key anyway um little little turkey knows she was not about to get there so um um so anyway um no it was like an hour before 10 30.

633
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:28,100
it was more than an hour before 10 30 So, you know, we got, we checked everything in, our baggage and everything.

634
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:36,560
And then, um, and then, you know, we had got all the tags for the dog, for the kennel stuff.

635
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:37,940
Like, oh, there was so much stuff.

636
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,780
You had, like, tags and, like, um, wires and stuff like that.

637
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:42,440
You had to lock it.

638
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,440
All the cages and everything, all these stickers.

639
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:47,020
And then they're like, wait right here.

640
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:51,420
You got to wait for a person to help you bring your dog through security.

641
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:54,760
We were like, me and my family were like, okay.

642
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:57,100
So we waited.

643
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:59,200
And we waited.

644
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:01,400
And we waited.

645
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:10,320
And then the lady, or sorry, the man, that was like, you know, the flight, I don't know what they're called.

646
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:16,840
The people that were helping you check in baggage people were like making calls and everything.

647
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:31,740
Because the thing is, the dog, needs to go through their own form of security before they are able to go through to the plane.

648
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:33,400
But we had to be there.

649
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:34,640
So we waited.

650
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,680
And then 30 minutes passed.

651
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:44,620
The flight attendant, the, the, the, isn't flight attendant, like they were the ones that check in your, your tickets and your luggage.

652
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:46,520
They're like, they made another call.

653
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:47,460
It's like, where are you?

654
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:48,960
You know, like, where are you?

655
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:56,520
So then we're like, Oh, and then finally, a guy pushing cart came over.

656
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:59,160
Yeah, they need to ask my dog some questions.

657
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:00,920
They want to know, where is he going?

658
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,120
Like, why are you going there?

659
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:06,720
Yeah, so the airline, sorry, sorry.

660
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:10,760
So then, you know, a guy came over with a cart and he was like, he's like, all right, we're here.

661
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:11,460
We're here.

662
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:13,720
So we're like, where do we go?

663
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:17,280
Yeah, they're like, okay, so you have to take your dog over there, like pointing vaguely.

664
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:18,720
So we were so confused.

665
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:20,260
My family and I were so confused.

666
01:41:20,260 --> 01:42:42,450
by the way like you know there is 30 minutes have passed by then so we were very confused we're like okay um and then um okay we're gonna stop the story here because i need to blow my nose give me a second i don't have tissue right oh wait i do never mind jk i just gotta mute myself sorry cliffhanger does this dog does this dog have any bombs but that's the thing that's what the security is for they want to check the kennel if there's fucking bombs or drugs hidden in his fucking blankets so what the fuck the dog is doing the dog is the bomb so anyway um that was the whole point anyway so it's my dog a terrorist so um um anyway so we're confused me my family and the cart pusher we're so confused because i don't fucking know why he doesn't know where to go because we assumed that he knew where to go just because like you know it's his job like the the airline staff literally called him over to take our dog to wherever he's supposed to go so we're just standing here and then the security

667
01:42:42,450 --> 01:43:20,350
line people like the security officers that deal with the line for the security went up to us and was like um you guys got a hurry um because um security closes at uh 10 30 and you won't be able to enter like enter through the gates after that so obviously we were like panicking because um there was 30 minutes left before security closes so we're like where the fuck do we go and then one of the one guy one of the securities the

668
01:43:23,450 --> 01:44:33,150
oversized baggages or like and like to put bags through the check-in badge came over and was like you pointing to the guy pushing the car you you need to go all underground and then around and it's through this door so you can go through the staff door with the dog oh no you have to go through here so we can get you checked out out um and you have to go through all the way from the underground staff door yeah it's a maze apparently and then and through that door through this door to come to security um and then uh he didn't have to bring the dog but he the staff had to do that because it's part of like security to make sure the staff doesn't carry anything like to make sure the staff also isn't hiding anything dangerous so and then the staff was like what do you mean that's not how we do it and then the security guy was like no that's how our airport has done this this always so i don't know and then like the attendant the airline attendant came over and was like no that's not how we

669
01:44:33,150 --> 01:44:56,430
do it i don't understand that's not how we always do it and then the security guy was like no we've always done this for years i don't know why you don't know the proper protocols of how to do it because we're like why can't we just push the cart over to the security check because it was just in front of us It was literally 10 steps away.

670
01:44:57,150 --> 01:45:01,630
Like, we literally, and he was like, you can bring the dog over and put the car here.

671
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:02,670
And we walked 10 steps.

672
01:45:03,070 --> 01:45:05,490
Put the dog in the security check table.

673
01:45:06,490 --> 01:45:16,870
And, and, um, and then later he was like, all right, now you to the staff guy, you have to go underground.

674
01:45:17,490 --> 01:45:18,670
Go around here.

675
01:45:18,970 --> 01:45:22,950
Take the elevator, come back up and show up from this door.

676
01:45:22,970 --> 01:46:12,130
door and then we can do the security check on the dog and then me and my family just stood there and waited for this one guy to show up from that one door and then the security guy was like it's protocol like you have to do it we've done this is how we do all our pet checks I'm like why does he have to go through some fucking hunger game trials like he doesn't even like we don't even know this man like he just works for the airline like I don't know this guy like

677
01:46:15,860 --> 01:46:26,920
so okay for this let me see if I can draw this out like so I and then like It's just airport bureaucracy

678
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:52,720
Okay Okay Alright And then Okay I'm gonna draw this out It's gonna be really bad And then And then there's And then Man The security man

679
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:32,880
okay so okay so let me draw this out so okay I don't know if it makes sense at all but basically all right let me grab the picture okay So, there's a dog, there's me and my family, there's a security man, and the staff guy has to come out from this door,

680
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:37,100
and he will not accept anything else.

681
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:39,400
He cannot come from the side.

682
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:45,320
He cannot show up, you know, through the regular people area.

683
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:51,440
He has to show up from this door, and only this door.

684
01:47:55,830 --> 01:48:03,150
So, the thing is, to get to this door, let me draw another, like, picture for you guys.

685
01:48:03,870 --> 01:48:10,150
So, is that this, okay, okay, wait, wait, wait, this is the door.

686
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:14,910
He had, there's, like, an underground system.

687
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:16,670
He has to go through an elevator.

688
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:22,970
He takes an elevator, L, and it goes straight down, and then there's, like,

689
01:48:26,350 --> 01:48:27,770
The door.

690
01:48:33,290 --> 01:48:35,670
From what he was explaining.

691
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:38,990
Okay.

692
01:48:39,570 --> 01:48:40,090
And then.

693
01:48:42,290 --> 01:48:42,830
Second.

694
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:44,850
First elevator.

695
01:48:47,650 --> 01:48:48,410
There you go.

696
01:48:49,670 --> 01:48:50,910
He has to go through.

697
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:52,590
First elevator.

698
01:48:53,190 --> 01:48:53,830
And then.

699
01:48:54,470 --> 01:49:25,720
second elevator second and then this is the dog sorry i'm not drawing anything yet all right there you go i'm not showing anything yet okay here you go it's like i kind of sometimes i hate the bureaucracy and how backwards everything is all right so here's another picture

700
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:44,340
So, to illustrate, to illustrate this, he has to go through, he could, you know, he could just walk to the, there, and then we're all here.

701
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:59,540
But the thing is he has to take the first elevator and then go through this long maze and then go to the second elevator.

702
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:02,340
And then, cause he has to go through security.

703
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:04,040
Sorry, there's security right here.

704
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:11,380
Okay, sorry, let me draw like red, like beep, beep, beep, beep, security.

705
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:17,240
Security.

706
01:50:18,380 --> 01:50:18,980
There you go.

707
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:19,700
So,

708
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:27,120
yeah, it's like the Disney tunnels.

709
01:50:28,020 --> 01:50:31,920
So, he's got to do his own security right here.

710
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:37,440
And it's like, you know, first elevator, second, and then security down here.

711
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:39,660
And then, that's not us, by the way.

712
01:50:39,740 --> 01:50:41,000
It's the staff member.

713
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:53,380
Like, and it takes a second elevator to go through this door, this door right here, while we're all waiting.

714
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:57,300
So it was like, you know, white rabbit tapping the clock.

715
01:50:57,680 --> 01:50:59,540
Tick tock, tick tock.

716
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:01,560
Like, when it...

717
01:51:04,820 --> 01:51:29,420
so we waited and we waited and then we're like where the fuck is this guy like the security guy was like don't worry he'll show up soon like he'll show up soon don't worry we've done this many times he'll show up and my parents and i we waited

718
01:51:32,580 --> 01:51:34,820
10 minutes passed.

719
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:38,120
Another five minutes passed.

720
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:42,200
Soon, there was 10 minutes till 10.30.

721
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:44,740
It was 10.20.

722
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:48,860
And the guy has yet to show up.

723
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:51,460
And then...

724
01:51:51,460 --> 01:52:02,460
And then, one of the ladies at the other security booth came up to us and was like, He came back.

725
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:08,320
He didn't know where to go.

726
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:09,480
And he came back.

727
01:52:10,340 --> 01:52:12,540
And we were like, what?

728
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:18,010
What do you mean?

729
01:52:18,350 --> 01:52:20,050
He came back up.

730
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:27,270
So...

731
01:52:29,310 --> 01:52:32,450
There were five minutes left.

732
01:52:37,800 --> 01:53:36,600
and the security guy was like it was like okay let me get the flight attendant to stay on standby because like the thing is while we were waiting he was like i'll just do the security check now and then all we have to do is wait for him to show up and we can drop the dog in the cart and he can take it to the plane so we're like okay so he was just literally you know like i don't it wasn't even that complicated of the security check like all he had to do was just pat the bed to make sure we didn't fucking sneak in he he wasn't even touching the dog he didn't care if the dog had a goddamn bomb or drugs up his ass he was drugs was not in the bed.

733
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:37,840
That's it.

734
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:40,340
It's up.

735
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:44,480
Just patting the bed and making sure.

736
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:47,060
It was like, you know, we were like, hold your dog.

737
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:47,960
And we're like, okay.

738
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:50,880
And then he was just patting the bed and everything.

739
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:53,860
And it was done in like three minutes.

740
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:55,480
Like three to five minutes.

741
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:57,440
He didn't care if the dog had anything.

742
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:02,340
Just as long as it's not in the bed or in the kennel.

743
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:57,080
And then we put the dog back into the kennel and then we're just waiting for the security waiting for the staff guy to push our dog through like the security area to the play and then when we realize we're five minutes left um the security guy was like okay we're gonna get the we're i'm going to a flight attendant and like he's just gonna stand there and wait for you guys because like protocol wise thank god he finally fucking broke protocol because he was like yeah no you just you sorry i think it was 11 30 by the way it was definitely it was 11 30 it was not 10 30 because i feel like 10 30 the restaurants will still be open.

744
01:54:57,700 --> 01:55:07,720
But it was like, and then he's like, you stand there and wait where the staff got to show up so the family can go through security.

745
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:12,040
And we managed to go through, we were the last people.

746
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:16,400
And literally, it was three minutes left till closing.

747
01:55:16,780 --> 01:55:20,500
We were literally the last people that went through security.

748
01:55:20,980 --> 01:55:25,920
And we did not get dinner because everything was closed.

749
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:43,300
So little Doki, so bright, hopeful, and did not eat anything for dinner because all she was thinking about was, I can't wait to get some food inside.

750
01:55:43,660 --> 01:55:48,560
Because I was like, Mama, can we get white spot?

751
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:51,540
Because like, there's white spot right now.

752
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:55,500
Can we get a white spot before we check in?

753
01:55:55,940 --> 01:56:15,620
then mama was like don't worry we can eat inside the terminal i was like okay because we passed by a white spot i was like mama there's a white spot in the in the airport can i grab white i'm so hungry can i grab a white spot

754
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:24,160

756
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:04,960
I was like, mama, there's a vending machine.

757
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:06,640
I'm so thirsty.

758
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:14,700
Do you think we can get to the vending machine and get some water and some snacks, mama?

759
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:21,680
And then mama and papa was like, let's head to our gate first.

760
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:25,920
Let's head to our gate first before there's vending machines there.

761
01:57:25,940 --> 01:57:28,340
So, we'll get there first, okay?

762
01:57:28,420 --> 01:57:32,000
And then we'll get to grab you the water and the snacks.

01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:33,280
I was like, okay.

764
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:35,720
And then we get to our gate.

765
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:42,500
And I looked around and I was like, Mama, where are the vending machines?

766
01:57:51,580 --> 01:57:53,880

We're talking rogo, we're talking real genuine soft-baked pretzels.

793
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:45,540
Were they unsalted?

794
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:46,500
Was there no sauce?

795
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:49,380
Was it literally a hard-baked no salt?

796
02:03:49,980 --> 02:03:51,680
The airplane way.

797
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:54,520
That's how traumatic it was.

798
02:03:54,660 --> 02:03:57,580
The fact that I remember what the fuck these pretzels taste like.

799
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:59,040

The worst part.

809
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:19,780
That flight, that flight I had to take, the plane did not have a screen.

810
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:23,540
No screens at all.

811
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:27,040
No TV screen in front of me.

812
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:31,060
No TV screen coming out from the plane on the top.

813
02:05:31,060 --> 02:06:27,200
I am true raw dog moment there you know and as a child that is not how you want to go that's not how you want to go no name thank you a super chat thank you thank you suffering builds character I have so much character I that's why I have such a big personality nothing yeah nothing but turbulence yeah so I feel like this was like all trauma it's just it's just it's just trauma all the ways I'm sorry my hangout session is my free therapy session it really is

814
02:06:31,060 --> 02:07:03,840
current and past dokey yeah yeah oh but anyway that's how fucked Canadian bureaucracy is um I mean I told you guys the vet stories like that shit is wild the hoops I have to jump through to like get my dog prescription and everything I think by the way I recently learned that Canadian I thought,

815
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:29,380
I thought guys, I thought Canadian Amazon, oh, oh my gosh okay, so I found out the difference between like Canadian Amazon and American Amazon so like one of my friends they were asking me about like the dog food that I have to like the special diet and they're like,

816
02:07:29,460 --> 02:08:41,020
oh, what kind of like dog because they were planning on putting their dog on a special diet as well so they were like asking what brand it was it was like oh um it's hills um that's the brand i use and my dog is on kidney care and then they're like oh yeah i'm gonna try and order it because i was like you can just order it off of amazon because that's what i do and they're like oh okay so they try to order it off of amazon and then they're like wait it says i need like a prescription from my vet i was like what the fuck you know like what do you mean so apparently special diets for dogs or cats in america um your vet has to prescribe it to you but in canada they don't fucking care just order it off of that yeah yeah so like you have to like grab a special number from your vet to like be given permission to order like special food for your pets in america but in canada i literally find the food and then i order it off of amazon i get it in one to two days because our food there's no

817
02:08:41,020 --> 02:09:12,120
it's not a prescription you know it's just like recommended they're like yeah we recommend you get this dog food and then like i just order it like it's yeah it's you can't just and that's like it's so weird i was like what like I should just buy it off of Amazon it comes in in one in two days like it's so but the thing is it's so weird it's so weird like there's like certain things you can't just order off of Amazon Canada and certain things you can apparently in America it's like so weird

818
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:32,100
Because in Canada, there are like, you know, medication and, and like, not like, you know, bad drugs, but like, medication drugs that you have to be prescribed on, or you have to prescribe to get it.

819
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:36,040
And, like, you can't get off the counter or anything.

820
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:42,100
Like, you actually have to ask the, you have to ask the pharmacist to, like, grab, like, some sort of...

821
02:09:42,120 --> 02:10:20,540
certain medications or some certain like special drugs monitor drugs or anything like um from the pharmacist to be able to purchase it because it's all like locked like behind counter but then i found out um because like one time similar story um they're asking me about a certain medication i forgot what it was i was like oh yeah yeah i can um yeah you can just grab that um you can have you get it like uh uh you have to ask the pharmacist uh to be able to or get it prescribed and you're like oh i could just order it off of amazon i was like what

822
02:10:24,120 --> 02:10:46,380
what do you mean by that yeah see comes in like one or two days i just it's just on amazon i was like what the do you mean i have to walk to the pharmacy and ask if they have it in stock It's at the pharmacy I was like, what do you mean you can just order it online?

823
02:10:47,560 --> 02:11:09,500
Yeah, so it was like, yeah, apparently what was it melatonin for melatonin in Canada You can't just Amazon order melatonin You have to you have to get that like because you know you have to ask the pharmacist like to be like oh, yeah I would like to have some But like in America

824
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,460
you can just Amazon order it

825
02:11:21,580 --> 02:11:36,400
you don't need a prescription you just have to go to the pharmacy and like you have to go to the pharmacy and ask for it but because it's off the counter it's not on the counter you have to ask for it and be like um can I get some melatonin and they're like yeah yeah

826
02:11:41,080 --> 02:12:12,140
now off the shelf i remember before it was like you have to go to the pharmacy you have to like just be like can i have like melatonin uh i guess i guess we passed the law and be like you can do it now but there are some medications that like i don't remember which one it was i don't remember which medication it was because like it was a while ago and they're like no i'm just ordering off of amazon i was like what the do you mean i have to fucking i was like i have to walk to the Like,

827
02:12:12,140 --> 02:12:13,080
what do you mean?

828
02:12:13,180 --> 02:12:14,600
You can just order it online.

829
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:15,400
Yeah.

830
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:20,460
Yeah.

831
02:12:21,740 --> 02:12:21,900
Um.

832
02:12:23,700 --> 02:12:31,460
So, so like, it's fucking, I hate Canada bureaucracy, but like, sometimes it's good.

833
02:12:31,680 --> 02:12:33,220
Sometimes, we have some positives.

834
02:12:33,420 --> 02:12:35,040
Like, you know, we can, at least we can order.

835
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:39,420
At least we can order dog food online.

836
02:12:39,740 --> 02:12:43,020
Like, you think Like, this is the thing I don't understand.

837
02:12:43,160 --> 02:12:44,020
We need a prescription.

838
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:47,700
Like, in America, you need a prescription for dog food.

839
02:12:48,100 --> 02:12:50,880
But, like, who the fuck cares about human medication?

840
02:12:51,600 --> 02:12:55,700
Who the fuck cares about human medication?

841
02:12:56,520 --> 02:13:00,080
Like, it's just...

842
02:13:01,740 --> 02:13:04,880
No, but the thing is, yes, you can order dog food online.

843
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:07,060
But, like, it has to be prescribed.

844
02:13:07,120 --> 02:13:08,740
Like, the special diet ones.

845
02:13:08,980 --> 02:13:11,060
The special diet ones, it has to...

846
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:16,500
You have to get your vet to like prescribe you the special food.

847
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:19,360
But in Canada, you don't do that.

848
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:21,360
You just fucking order it online.

849
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:26,520
Like, like the vet just recommends you the food.

850
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:29,880
And then literally on Amazon, two to three days, it's over.

851
02:13:29,980 --> 02:13:31,700
Like I don't have to give them any information.

852
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:33,120
It just arrives.

853
02:13:35,560 --> 02:13:41,060
But in America, it's like you have to jump through so many hoops to give your dog special food.

854
02:13:41,080 --> 02:13:55,240
But then like if you want to order like medication or like any special type of drugs for like, you know Like the actual not the illegal ones the legal ones The pharmaceutical drugs like you could just order that off of Amazon who the fuck cares like

855
02:13:59,180 --> 02:14:06,480
Fuck cares yeah Yeah, thank you the super chat.

856
02:14:06,640 --> 02:14:06,760
Thank you.

857
02:14:07,120 --> 02:14:07,560
Thank you.

858
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:07,560
Thank you.

859
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:08,840
TSB collab tomorrow.

860
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:09,860
Oh, it's not tomorrow.

861
02:14:10,080 --> 02:15:12,740
I think it's a it's the day after tomorrow unless you're like uh so it's it's on it's on thursday yeah it's on thursday i think it was super chat thank you thank you what's the story behind the name um for those who've never heard of tsb um the team it's team snake bite um so the name is team snake bite and the team name came from uh it was part of an apex tournament and um it was based we had other names at first there was other names and then um we i asked a very important question because i used to ask this question a lot to my homies because i want to know if they're a true homie or not you know like this is the only question this is a question that you ask people to know if they're a bro or not if they're a real homie and it's basically like if a snake fit your dick would you would you suck the poison out of the dick like Or let your homie die.

862
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:17,080
So, obviously, this is like the only question you ask.

863
02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:18,980
Like, it's the ultimate vibe check, you know?

864
02:15:23,480 --> 02:15:29,180
It's the ultimate bro check to see if, like, he's a real homie or not.

865
02:15:29,480 --> 02:15:31,500
So, I asked that question.

866
02:15:32,080 --> 02:15:36,200
And then I was like, we were like, we were brainstorming names before.

867
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:40,140
And I'm like, we were like having a huge debate and everything.

868
02:15:41,080 --> 02:16:05,100
wouldn't do it and he still wouldn't it's been years and he still wouldn't save a homie he was like I fucking let that guy die he's like I ain't sucking poison out like it is like fuck that shit I was like bro that didn't cool man and then I was like guys what do we call ourselves team snake bite

869
02:16:10,380 --> 02:17:14,080
so so so after we were arguing for like an hour straight about whether or not like he was like like about why he should do it and then we were talking about like coffee pasta and then the chat started spamming like do not wallow tsp is here to swallow if he's low then you gotta blow for a wind to keep you gotta go deep our throats will get till we get the bag so like when we're the tournament people will start like spamming this to cheer for us on like broadcasts and stuff because you know that's what people do back then like you know like copy pasta like oh my gosh there was like so like you know in esports if you guys ever watch esports people would make like dumb ass copy pastas but they're so fucking clever there's so many like clever shit i don't remember does anyone remember like the classic esport copy pastas that people used to do when they're cheering for their teams i can't remember them on the top of my head but we were like like replicating that because like you know that

870
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:38,800
brings team like that brings like people that cheer for like you know when they want cheer for their team um people would start chanting these things out so we're like oh we should we should make one for our team you know so yeah like people can spam that like to um spam this yeah spam this pine to help c9 like shit like that like

871
02:17:42,120 --> 02:18:12,780
yeah spam this noodle to help skedoodle like people would spam that in esports so like in like esport tournaments like in any game like league counter strike overwatch like shit like that so we're like oh my god guys we should do something similar for our team like so to bring up like team spirit for like people who want to cheer for us so that's where tsb came from it was like one of the most the one of and then the thing is by calling us tsb um It was a Japanese tournament.

872
02:18:13,780 --> 02:18:15,300
Because we called ourselves TSB.

873
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:16,800
We didn't call ourselves Team Snake Bite.

874
02:18:16,940 --> 02:18:18,180
We just put TSB.

875
02:18:18,660 --> 02:18:25,460
So the Japanese viewers and the Japanese commentators did not know the context behind our names.

876
02:18:28,250 --> 02:18:29,610
It's so...

877
02:18:29,610 --> 02:18:30,490
It's so...

878
02:18:30,490 --> 02:18:35,590
They don't know why the fuck we called ourselves TSB.

879
02:18:36,190 --> 02:18:39,550
Because we gave zero context.

880
02:18:40,610 --> 02:18:42,470
Because we didn't explain it.

881
02:18:42,490 --> 02:19:44,370
like because we were just called TSB so they're like oh TSB TSB you know so there was like no actual context so people were like oh it's so it's so say so it's so normal but the English speaking side knows the real story they know why we were called TSB in the true context so um the Japanese side didn't know why they just thought it was all tsb you know just tsb like little do they know yeah one of the commenters praising how cool the name was because it sounded cool you know tsb tsb but then we're actually called team snake bite because we're like will you suck your your would you suck the poison out of your homie's dick like it's like sweet summer child You don't know the real context.

882
02:19:47,310 --> 02:19:48,690
Do they know?

883
02:19:49,130 --> 02:19:50,410
They didn't know.

884
02:19:53,170 --> 02:19:56,390
So, that's the context of TSB.

885
02:19:56,590 --> 02:20:02,330
It was honestly one of the greatest group names I've ever came up with.

886
02:20:04,970 --> 02:20:05,490
Dude, bear.

887
02:20:06,090 --> 02:20:09,470
Chat came up with it, but I stole it and took credit.

888
02:20:10,910 --> 02:20:12,470
Because I was like, I looked at chat.

889
02:20:12,490 --> 02:20:14,910
And someone was like, you should call yourself Team Snake Fight.

890
02:20:15,030 --> 02:20:18,830
