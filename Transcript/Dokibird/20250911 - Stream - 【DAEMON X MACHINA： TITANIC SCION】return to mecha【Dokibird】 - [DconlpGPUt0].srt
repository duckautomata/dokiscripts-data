But I actually had the game running for the last like 30 minutes.

3
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,710
It actually didn't mute the game because the soundtrack is actually really, really good.

For those who are wondering what game this is, you don't need to know.

8
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,610
This is actually a sequel to the first Damien X Machina game.

9
00:05:25,690 --> 00:06:35,630
game to understand the sequel because it's like set in the future it's basically set in the same world but in the future of the previous events so you don't have any you don't even have any previous knowledge to enjoy the story so it is a new story um and it is a sci-fi adventure where and uh where there's mechs and mechas involved so you know you're all you're gonna get into a giant robot uh we love giant robots um and they're called arsenals and you fully customize the like different abilities and you can loot other players uh other players arsenals so because this is an open world online game uh because you can turn online features on so you can encounter other players who've died and you can loot their stuff because it's i mean they're dead like what are you gonna what are you gonna do fight back like they're dead for it's their fault that they're dead like it's at that point it's anybody's loot so uh you can also like do yeah doing my loot now uh so there's an open world uh so you

11
00:07:51,770 --> 00:08:22,790
sponsor to win that's my favorite part initiate jokie mode humankind and the red planet south to expand their reach colonizing the blue planet and modifying its environment for human habitation 283 years past the blue planet south independence from earth prime thus began a war that lasts of 76 years at its conclusion the two planets formed a non-intervention treaty all interstellar between them was halted.

12
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:29,070
A defense system was put in a place, including orbital elevators and monitoring satellites, made to repel any evaders.

13
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,450
Voices for a new world echoed across the blue pattern.

14
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,290
Voices that would shape their government.

15
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,970
Monomaly appeared in the world.

16
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,870
People born with innate special abilities.

17
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:43,390
That's me, caused by the femto-energy used during colonization and the war.

18
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,270
I'm special.

19
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,990
That's what my mom always tells me.

20
00:08:47,290 --> 00:09:19,590
I'm a special little girl these beings are designed designated okay that's not me i have rights and call it out is mental energy will change countless other creatures turning them into aggressive organisms that will come to be known as immortals others were rejected but that's not me that's not me i am very much socially accepted in the society the cruel treatment widening in the rift between them and humanity and so came the great war three to sixty nine years after colonization,

21
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,510
bringing with this revolution for the elders who enact the strict military dream through sovereign axiom.

22
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:33,930
The three supreme leaders of the axiom, dubbed the Trinidad, separated the ground, the home of the humans from the garden, the aerial paradise.

23
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,590
The elders called home.

24
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:40,610
The humans who resisted the rule of the axiom will take the title of reclaimers.

25
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,350
Alright.

26
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,190
Skip to...

27
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:46,710
Oh, okay.

28
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,850
That's not me.

29
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,090
I have rights, guys.

30
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,510
I am not... I'm very much socially...

31
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,210
I am very much socially accepted into society.

32
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,700
Doki, I didn't know you could read that much.

33
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,660
It's okay, guys.

34
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,180
Today I learned how to read just this amount.

35
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,200
Just those specific words and only these words.

36
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh, okay.

37
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,520
So we're going to create...

38
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,560
What do I create?

39
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,860
Do I create... You know what?

40
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,180
We're going to create...

41
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,120
All right.

42
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,040
How short?

43
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,820
Okay, Todd.

44
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,020
The smaller my head, the smaller my hitbox.

45
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,480
That's how we do this here.

46
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,220
Oh my god, wait, I could create a dragoon technically.

47
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,420
Wait, how much customization do I get in general?

48
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,320
It feels like a lot.

49
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,440
Okay, both of these outfits are really good.

50
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,740
Wait.

51
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,620
Oh, okay, yeah.

52
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,260
Both of these outfits are actually pretty good.

53
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,780
good.

54
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,600
Oh my gosh, it's hard.

55
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,560
Okay, we'll do dragon color.

56
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,100
We'll do dragon colors.

57
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,420
It was reflex!

58
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,220
Okay!

59
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,580
I'm...

60
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,180
It was...

61
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,460
It was reflex.

62
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,280
Wait.

63
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,020
Look, we've done more customization for your ancestors than your current form.

64
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,940
We're the Yellow Rangers.

65
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,020
Okay, there you go.

66
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,620
There.

67
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,880
There we go.

68
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:26,920
Uh.

69
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,280
I don't even know what they sound like.

70
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,710
Okay.

71
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,130
Alright.

72
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:41,570
Alright.

73
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,150
Actually, if we're gonna be a...

74
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,210
Okay, no.

75
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:48,010
Alright.

76
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,530
We wanna be a...

77
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,310
Oh yeah.

78
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,010
Do we wanna be, like, optimists?

79
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:02,390
as if the world hasn't ruined us yet or like after being born.

80
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,970
This is us in the womb and then we were born.

81
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,870
Before we realized what the world was like.

82
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:14,450
All right.

83
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:15,490
This is us.

84
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,050
The moment we were born.

85
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,150
This is us in the womb.

86
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,570
So optimistic.

87
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:21,990
So hopeful.

88
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,290
And then we came out of the womb.

89
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,950
You know it.

90
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,710
Oh, wait, this is even sad.

91
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,030
Wait.

92
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:33,410
Okay.

93
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,690
Let's see.

94
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,750
Can I get even...

95
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,270
Wait.

96
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,430
Okay, wait.

97
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,910
Wait, is there like a calf?

98
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:42,750
Oh, okay.

99
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,470
That's cute.

100
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,750
That's cute.

101
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,590
Okay, wait.

102
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,810
I'm trying to figure it out.

103
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:50,590
This?

104
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,230
Or this?

105
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,690
Okay.

106
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,790
You know what?

107
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,830
We'll go with this.

108
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,750
This feels more...

109
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,450
Okay, is there a way to...

110
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,610
What's this?

111
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,590
Is there a way to make myself more depressed?

112
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,510
Is there...

113
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,790
Where are my eye bags?

114
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,870
I want to know if I can have eye bags, though.

115
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,050
I like some life in my eyes.

116
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,130
Thank you.

117
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,150
Alright, let's see.

118
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,080
The extra...

119
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,360
Debris!

120
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,740
Too real!

121
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,980
Okay, wait.

122
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,120
No, we don't want heterochromia.

123
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,580
Uh, wait, what the heck?

124
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,800
I'm trying to... I don't know.

125
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:40,900
Okay.

126
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,700
Yeah, there we go.

127
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,660
That's the eye color we want.

128
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,320
And then...

129
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,340
What's this?

130
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,360
Pupil position?

131
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,670
Okay, yeah, that's good.

132
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,390

00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,370
Yeah.

Let's get ready for Halloween, too.

00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,980
It's almost Halloween.

151
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,060
Oh, wait, is that cloud makeup?

00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,460
Okay, no, wait, We gotta have cloud.

153

Wait, actually.

Okay, it's fine.

169
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,970

00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,790

It's art.

183
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,150

Where's my sensitivity?

252
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:07,410
Gameplay.

253
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,210
Okay, there you go.

254
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,650
Let's turn the sensitivity low.

255
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,230
It's way too high.

256
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:13,350
Alright.

257
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,610
There you go.

258
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,610
Alright, I'm heading over.

260
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:49,970
let's do mid.

261
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,230
I want to know what the balance is.

262
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,770
Initializing arsenal boot sequence.

263
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,270
Energy limiter released.

264
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,530
Weapon safety mechanism confirmed.

265
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,190
All operating at normal levels.

266
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,750
No, I don't want to be too slow.

267
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,030
Dial, welcome to tomato farm.

268
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,910
No, my beautiful family's let my hair stick out a little.

269
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,630
I imagine if you could have a feature where you're...

270
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:50,930
your hair sticks sticks out a little just a little afro oh I didn't see I still see a tutorial no my beautiful hair and my house would they know I'm done though the clouds apparently if you like use like dead players dead players stuff aren't Like, because you can fuse and customize your arsenal.

271
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,610
And if you use the dead player stuff to customize your arsenal, you become less human.

272
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,110
And that is obviously what we're going to do.

273
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,550
They're like, but be careful.

274
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,410
If you use it, you'll become less human.

275
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,470
And I'm like, so what is the con exactly for that?

276
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:14,790
Like, and I'm like, that doesn't sound.

277
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,070
Oh, so everything seems very positive.

278
00:24:17,890 --> 00:25:13,910

Okay, money.

281
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,270
You want me to get my money now?

282
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,170
I need to lower this sense.

283
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,250
It is so high Holy shit.

284
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:34,310

285
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,310
I'll just lower it just in case

286
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:49,070
Wait, what oh My god, I was looking at control I was lower Bring the control key.

287
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:49,690
Never.

288
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,170
Okay.

289
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,790
It makes more sense now.

290
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:52,690
Never mind.

291
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:53,370
All right.

292
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,490
I was like, wait a minute.

293
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:59,270
Why does the, why when I scroll down, it says mouse and keyboard.

294
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,110
What was I doing earlier?

295
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,030
All right.

296
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,490
Camera shake.

297
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,050
Okay.

298
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,470
No camera shake.

299
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,590
I hate camera shake.

300
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:08,570
All right.

301
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,150
Bring voices up.

302
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:11,490
Okay.

303
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,270
I'll do that.

304
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,950
Let me actually, yeah.

305
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,510
Bring voices up.

306
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,550
Voices already up.

307
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,350
I'll bring.

308
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,850
Music down just a little bit, and I'll turn Master up a little.

309
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,630
Alright, since we're looking at this, let me see if there's motion blur.

310
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,710
There's no motion...

311
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,030
Oh, that's nice.

312
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,230
There's no motion blur.

313
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,790
Usually there is, so that's good that it doesn't automatically come with motion blur.

314
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:36,390
Alright.

315
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:37,870
Now.

316
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:38,710
Okay, there you go.

317
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,150
That feels a lot better.

318
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:47,610
First they take your nose, then they're making your restaurant gray and sad.

319
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,390
Go, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

320
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:56,610
I think motion blur is usually for it to compensate for, like, consoles.

321
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,150
And it's just on automatically because of it.

322
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:01,590
I don't know.

323
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,210
Actually, I don't even know what's good about motion blur.

324
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,630
Okay, so we can slash the wires.

325
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,050
Nice.

326
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,970
I'll just go follow nerve.

327
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:11,950
Am I...

328
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,150
Wait, can I take damage?

329
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:14,550
Oh.

330
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,070
Oh, it doesn't matter.

331
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:16,950
It's fine.

332
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,790
We got this, don't worry.

333
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:22,510
Don't worry.

334
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,930
Taking damage doesn't matter.

335
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,810
There's no consequences, I think.

336
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:31,230
I don't see a health bar, so I assume there's no consequences to my actions.

337
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,250
It's like when you're- it's like those like quick time events.

338
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,710
More like even if you fail every quick time event, you still succeed.

339
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,490
You know how to prove it.

340
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,150
All he does is like, you okay?

341
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,080
What's the worst that could happen?

342
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,860
I die?

343
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,820
And then my restaurant fails?

344
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,180
See that?

345
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,660
No consequence.

346
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,400
He's trying his best.

347
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,660
It just sucks that he got signed to me as the group partner.

348
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,280
It's like when you're doing a group project and then you got me.

349
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,260
I'm too big to fail!

350
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,800
Okay, emergency dodge.

351
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,480
Okay, there's a dodge.

352
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:24,980
Reload.

353
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,240
Lock on.

354
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,000
Boost.

355
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:28,700
Oh, okay.

356
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,820
Oh, I can go so fast.

357
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,760
Look at me go.

361
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,760

Slashy slashy slashy.

365
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,140
No hesitation whatsoever.

366
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,140
I don't see skin.

367
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,660
Everyone dies equally.

368
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,520
That's it.

369
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,610
Thank you for the one gift and shit.

370
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,490

Equal rights for bots and humans.

00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,240

You gotta respect the time out.

419
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,020
Each player gets four timeouts.

420
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,420
We'll play sport rules.

421
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,680
Oh, I don't think I like this sword.

422
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,060
This sword is so slow.

423
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,460
Yeah, this sword is so slow.

424
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,420
Oh my god.

425
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,620

426
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,420
Okay, nice.

00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,240

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,700

430
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,420
I have three.

431
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:23,680
Okay.

432
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,080
Your loot sucks.

433
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,560
Wait.

434
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,600
Okay, there he is.

435
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,420
Oh, that's better.

436
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,420
That's a better sword.

437
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:31,760
All right.

438
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,240
We go.

439
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,000
QPU.

440
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,420
Yeah, that sword took me, like, four days to swing.

441
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,500
Can I swing that?

442
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,600
Electric tank?

443
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,560
What's the deal?

444
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,100
Oh, it does, like, extra damage.

445
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,820
Let's use these things and take them out.

446
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,880
Oh, it's a mounted turret.

447
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,800
Suppressing fire!

448
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,620

449
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,200
Oops, this guy.

450
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,860

451
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,200
Oh, it's little guys.

452
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,400
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

453
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,140
I'll get the little guys.

454
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,200
Um, excuse me.

455
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,620
Nerve, can you also do your job?

456
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,980
I feel like I'm killing all of them for us.

457
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,760
Uh, Nerve, why is there like a lot of them alive on your side?

458
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,100
That seems a little unfair.

459
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,420
Nerve, I see people alive on your side.

460
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:55,080

00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,580
We didn't.

463
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,000
Oh!

464
00:33:59,360 --> 00:33:59,960

465
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,960
Wait a minute.

466
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,620
I've been trying his attacks.

467
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,620
They just keep coming and coming.

468
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,240
Oh, no.

469
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,360
Oh, I have to kill these guys for him.

470
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,520
Bro, he's only half.

471
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,780
Donald, go to the next room.

472
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,900
Go to the next room and close the door.

473
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,620
He's just aura farming.

474
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,860
Oh, thank God.

475
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,700
I think God can leave.

476
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:28,540
Goodbye.

477
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,040
I have no emotional attachment to you.

478
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,200
I've only met you for like 10 minutes.

479
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,940
So, safe to say, I am willing to leave you to die.

480
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,980
Oh, wait.

481
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,580
He survived.

482
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,380
He lives?

483
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,000
That'll give us some time.

Okay, these are repair containers so I can grab kills.

All right.

488
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,160
Because I'm so low HP right now.

489
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,020

Goodbye.

501
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,740
You can take him.

Sick-ass knife.

509
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,500

00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,080
Oh, I was doomed to fail.

525
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,740
There is no way I was going to win that.

526
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:19,180
I was like a little ant trying to punch like a person's foot.

527
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,540
Boy, overclock mode.

528
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,480
Shunk!

529
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,440
What is he doing?

530
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,060
I'm buying you a little time.

531
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,760
Wait, is he gonna explode?

532
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,320
Is he gonna self-destruct?

533
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,100
Oh shit!

534
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,750
He's overclocking his GP!

535
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:53,070
Oh my, don't do it!

536
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,990
Don't overclock your GPU!

537
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,450
It's not worth it!

538
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,730
Commencing catapult launch sequence.

539
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,410
Your GPU can't handle it!

540
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,950
It's never worth it, Barney!

541
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,870
Let it go!

542
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,160
Safety mechanism released.

543
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,700
Engaging boosters.

544
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,860
No, if you're just gonna fry your GPU, bro!

545
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,500
It's like, dude on your stand, I need my 10 frames.

546
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,280
I'll be right behind you after I beat this guy.

547
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,500
It's even worse, I think he's overclocking his rap.

548
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:46,860
a CPU GPU and revs You're gonna short out your PSU nerve

549
00:38:52,060 --> 00:39:01,040
It's overheating your fans they're working at overtime How else can I run it with RTX on?

550
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:37,220
He returned to rescue nerve well I literally saw him get like five fucking slash like i don't think he's gonna be alive i don't think i don't think he's making it guys all right he's pretty it's not worth the nerve you're gonna front did you even back up your desktop did you even back up your std oh yeah no i'm dead i was not catching up to him And it's like,

551
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:37,880
chapter.

552
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,240
The end.

553
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,240
Roll credits.

554
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,120
I think that was scripted.

555
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,130
That had to be scripted.

556
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:08,870
Oh my gosh.

557
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,510
I'm just lagging a little bit.

558
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,490
I'm downloading.

559
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,310
I'm just downloading all the shaders right now.

560
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,310
It's just a load.

561
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,240
Aw, that's cute.

562
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,600
That's a cute design.

563
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,300
I'm compiling...

564
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,680
Yeah, I was compiling shaders.

565
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,320
Also, sound guys, is it better now?

566
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,480
What the...

567
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,760
Who are you?

568
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,530
Didn't know tin cans could talk.

569
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,630
Didn't know tin cans could talk.

570
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,470
That's right.

571
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,730
That's right, Clanker.

572
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,350
Don't be.

573
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:04,210
Huh?

574
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,570
My name's Toby.

575
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,170
You asked who I am, didn't you?

576
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:09,970
Whoa!

577
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,270
This is the desert in the Blue South area.

578
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,610
Blue South area.

579
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:19,250
The ground.

580
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,430
He called me a meatball!

581
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:22,990
It's dessert.

582
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:25,410
That all?

583
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:26,430
No more questions?

584
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,610
Can't just say that, Doki.

585
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:29,890
That's a child!

586
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:32,110
Hurry!

587
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,020
Forage?

588
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,260
Forge?

589
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,160
What the hell's going on?

590
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:45,990
Come on.

591
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,850
Oh, she is robo-phobic.

592
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,290
All right, search mode.

593
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:54,610
What is search mode?

594
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,430
Follow up to a lobby.

595
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,290
Oh, look at all this.

596
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:57,090
Stray.

597
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:58,570
Oh, shit.

598
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,550
A dead person.

599
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,390
Weapons may have different...

600
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,790
Even they are when you acquire equipment.

601
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:04,550
You can pair...

602
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,350
Oh, nice.

603
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,570
Who died here?

604
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,730
This is literally a tutorial.

605
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,130
How did you die here?

606
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,570
Oh, this is a tutorial, boy.

607
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:18,050
Okay, that's... It would be pretty silly if someone actually died in a tutorial.

608
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,110
Okay.

609
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,370
See, Toby is immortal, guys.

610
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,130
He's okay.

611
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,610
Wait, how do I... Search again?

612
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:27,890
Search.

613
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:28,650
Oh, it's control.

614
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,710
Wait, there's stuff over here.

615
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,510
Don't see him.

616
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:34,370
Forge?

617
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,110
Forge!

618
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:37,610
Alright, nice.

619
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:38,050
Yoink.

620
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:45,890

621
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,740

622
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:15,800
what the heck is that oh crap here they come immortals Oh, the immortals!

623
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,220
The ones that don't have rights!

624
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,160
I mean, you can sort of see...

625
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,860
You know, to be fair, I wouldn't give them the right time.

626
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:34,840
You can make enemies flinch by attacking them and raising their...

627
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,760
Yeah, they're the others!

628
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,800
That's what I'm saying!

629
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,720
They were like, yeah, they're outspouted by society.

630
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,480
They're not allowed to integrate into society.

631
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,760
I'm like, here I meet...

632
00:43:47,200 --> 00:44:15,180
uh raising approach of flinching and press f follow an attack on recalling to make them flinch a flinching enemy can be grabbed okay that's good to know i can grab them oh my god it explodes i thought it wasn't why does it it's not even a mecca apparently they're like apparently they have like built in built in self-destruct by in them.

633
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,360
What is this?

634
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,100
Michael Bay.

635
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:23,500
These, these, these, uh, these immortals were, were, were directed by Michael Bay.

636
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,360
I like injected C4 into them.

637
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,400
Rule of cool.

638
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:30,720
Okay.

639
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,360
All right.

00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,520
Let me, uh, okay, audio.

641
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,400
Apparently sound guy said to increase the audio.

642
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:41,940
All right.

643
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,920
Let me know that's better.

644
00:44:43,940 --> 00:45:00,660
All right Yeah, Michael Bay directed the Directed the abortive Use live ammo Aim from the side Aim from the side Okay I'm aiming When can I start grabbing them?

649
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:54,680
Hello?

650
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,260
I assume we're all human.

651
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,020
Would have been gobbled up by those things if you hadn't shown up.

652
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,300
Your arsenal.

653
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,400
It's from the garden, isn't it?

654
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,860
You're a runaway from up there, aren't you?

655
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,360
Easy now.

656
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,800
I'm not going to go reporting you to the Axiom or anything, promise.

657
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,240
Got sick of how the higher-ups run the place?

658
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,240
No, I'm Donald the clown.

659
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,440
These bastards in the Axiom can be stuck in their ways, that's for sure.

660
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,580
None of your business.

661
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,100
Oh, don't be like that.

662
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,640
Tell me, you got any connections down here?

663
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:33,260
Hmm?

664
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,400
I'm on my own.

665
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,080
And I'm fine with that.

666
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,440
No chance I'm relying on any humans.

667
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,700
I thought I'm human, too.

668
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,720
Wait, am I not human?

669
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,140
I look human.

670
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:44,900
Don't you?

671
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,400
Anyway, we're pretty far out right now.

672
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,840
How about you come with me?

673
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,020
I won't do you any harm.

674
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,340
Wait, I'm an elder.

675
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,100
How come that elder?

676
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,840
Wait, I don't trust.

677
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:58,380
You know what?

678
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:58,680
You're right.

679
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,040
That's why... See, I told you guys.

680
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,020
I don't discriminate between bots and fleshies.

681
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,940
I don't... That's why... That's why I equally murder everybody.

682
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,040
I don't trust humans.

683
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,500
I don't trust humans.

684
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:16,460
Look.

685
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,960
Oh, I'm a test tube, baby.

686
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:22,810
Here.

687
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:25,230
You can have this.

688
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:26,750
It's compatible with your suit.

689
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:29,970
I hate everybody equally.

690
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:34,510
Well, I can't just hand over some knickknacks and leave my savior here to rot.

691
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,410
Let me tune up your arsenal.

692
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:37,650
For free?

693
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:39,310
You fell through the atmosphere in that thing, didn't you?

694
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:41,710
It needs an overhaul, or else it'll fall.

695
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:43,290
Clowns aren't human.

696
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,270
Well, that settles it.

697
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:49,050
Follow me.

698
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:51,050
Of course you're not human, Doki.

699
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:52,390
Clowns aren't human.

00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:43,670
Where's my horse?

We come back.

727
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:45,390
Horse.

728
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:46,150

00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,180
Damn, bitch.

730
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,580
Oh, my God.

731
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,180
My horse left.

732
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,920
I don't think he's coming back, guys.

733
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,580
I don't think so.

734
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,520
Alright, attach approach and press F to attain an item.

735
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,120
Alright.

736
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:02,820
Alright.

737
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,580
What's this?

738
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:05,920
Development data.

739
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,540
Heavyweight also worn fairly high grabbing performance.

740
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,480
Alright, let's see.

741
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,740
Development data is used when developing equipment.

742
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,080
Oh, okay, so I can make new equipment with this.

743
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,440
Do you know how to modify my suit?

744
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,560
Modify?

745
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,080
Like customizing it?

746
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,100
I guess I'll fly.

747
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,880
Like I normie.

748
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,240
What kind of mod do you think?

749
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,840
Nothing extravagant.

750
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,720
Just needed up to a...

751
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,500
Wait, is that another horse?

752
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,600
At the very least.

753
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,880
And what you gonna do with that?

754
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,980
I guess I'll be a normie and fly.

755
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,120
Crushed those bastards and rescue my friend.

756
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,480
You wanna take them on all by yourself?

757
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,980
You're joking, right?

758
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,860
Serious as a heart attack.

759
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,680
And so, thank you for the super chat.

760
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:52,300
Thank you.

761
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:52,540
Thank you.

762
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,700
The main character is Christina V.

763
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,340
Was after a ladybug?

764
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,080
Oh, that's pretty cool.

767
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,320
the fort all

768
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:36,350
right i'm in the main hub I think this is the main hub.

769
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:38,190
We don't want the axe to see us, though.

770
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:38,710
How goes the ocean?

771
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,710
So we're taking the secret way through the back.

772
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:41,490
The secret way?

773
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:43,550
I think everybody sees us, guys.

774
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:49,810
Guys, he's like, all right, remain incognito, okay?

775
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:50,950
I'm like, wee!

776
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:51,610
Yippee!

777
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:52,710
Yippee!

778
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:53,450
Yippee!

779
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:53,610
Yippee!

780
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:56,910
This is the Coliseum.

781
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:59,250
We hold all kinds of show fights here.

782
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:03,910
Bare-handed fist fights, arsenal matches, even fights against immortals.

783
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:04,790
You name it?

784
00:53:04,950 --> 00:54:08,040
it flies here do you think they know do you think they notice me outers humans whatever it technically belongs to the axiom but it's being managed by old fort so security's pretty lax hey coming through hey forge what whoa whoa whoa what's that isn't that an axiom suit yeah i'm not like other axioms nothing special gotta work fast for it falls apart so scoot hard at work as always good for you no rest for the poverty stricken you gotta make ends meeting in hell easy peasy yeah i'm not like other acts i'm not like other others there are various facilities inside the base including the console which allows you to change your equipment and customize your arsenal shops where you can buy and sell equipment look up your other.

785
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,440
I mean, Ice Cream Pillar?

786
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,840
I want to go to the Ice Cream Pillar.

787
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,440
You can take off your arsenal there.

788
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,180
Wait, where's the Ice Cream Pillar?

789
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,720
Come over when you've changed.

790
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:17,320
Alright.

791
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,020
I'll take it.

792
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,300
Alright.

793
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,800
Where's the Ice Cream Pillar?

794
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,580
Oh my god, snow!

795
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:24,860
Snow often!

796
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,400
Welcome!

797
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,020
Hello.

798
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,200
I like some cold, delicious ice cream sound.

799
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,600
I like some ice cream, please.

800
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:34,560
Unfortunately.

801
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,240
I can't actually serve you any until Remodeling is done.

802
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:38,800
Excuse me.

803
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,660
I can literally see the ice cream behind you.

804
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,420
What do you mean?

805
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,360
I, ma'am, I see the ice cream.

806
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,980
Just open the window.

807
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:50,480
What, what remodeling?

808
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,440
What remodeling do you, okay, it's pretty dirty.

809
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,440
I would say it is pretty dirty.

810
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,900
That ice cream machine cannot be broken because it's literally in tubs.

811
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,920
Just give me the entire tub.

812
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:04,740
I don't care.

813
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:11,260
That's just for It's like those Japanese displays Japanese food where it's like fake food and not real.

814
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,020
This here's my gym's hangar.

815
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,700
Might be in the dumps where the rent is cheap, but hey.

816
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:18,840
Home's in the heart.

817
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:19,820
Not the place.

818
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:20,860
Gym?

819
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,520
Can't believe it.

820
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:23,820
Wherever I go.

821
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,140
The ice cream machine is always broken.

822
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,660
Gyms are where you train your Coliseum fighters.

823
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,900
Not that it's seen much use.

824
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,040
Since I don't have any fighters as of now.

825
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,040
But my dream is to raise a child.

826
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:41,100
How can be Donald the clown without my ice cream?

827
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,320
I'd better take a look at your broken down gear.

828
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,000
Feel free to take a look around in the meantime, alright?

829
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:50,800
Alright.

830
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,100
Oh yeah, I gotta talk to the kid.

831
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,120
Hello, Toby.

832
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,520
Welcome to our humble dump of a gym.

833
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:03,310
That cat got your tongue?

834
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:05,630
Broken manners, broken mouth.

835
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,870
Is your body a piece of shit too?

836
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:08,430
Whoa!

837
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:10,730
Language, Toby!

838
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:12,430
Who programmed you that?

839
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:14,350
Oh, he just has access to the internet.

840
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:15,510
No, I'm...

841
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,370
Oh, Toby, what's your fucking language?

842
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:18,170
What?

843
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,010
Please don't mind him.

844
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,450
He gets his foul mouth from his father.

845
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:25,970
Not you.

846
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:28,350
Yep, he's my little boy.

847
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:33,730
Okay, Forge might have messed up by linking him to the internet.

848
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,150
Forge, you're supposed to...

849
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:41,570
Austin saw a fire wall on this kid.

850
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:43,190
Oh my god, there's a cat.

851
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:45,390
Or is that dog?

852
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:47,190
What are you?

853
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:56,670
What are you?

854
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:58,750
Are you a dog or are you a cat?

855
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:01,270
Okay, I assume the head's a dog.

856
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:02,850
He's a dog cat.

857
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:06,650
Oh, look at him.

858
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:07,970
He's so cute.

859
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:09,670
I compared him.

860
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:13,710
Alright, uh, we gotta go this way, the concept.

861
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:17,350
This terminal here is for receiving orders.

862
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:19,470
Pet the cat!

863
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:23,830
More often than not, Coliseum fighters are also registered mercenaries.

864
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:30,470
It's hard to make a living on fight money alone, so I make a little on the side from taking outside requests.

865
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:38,110
Hate to say it, but none of the fighters from my gym have been money makers so far.

866
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:39,510
But is this their week?

867
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:42,930
So I gotta work for chump change, fixing up arsenals here and there.

868
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:45,410
Oh, it's like Fight Club.

869
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:49,230
But, like, all the fighters suck here.

870
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:52,830
The console has many functions.

871
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:53,930
Chaining the equipment.

872
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,090
Oh, you are still accepting.

873
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,370
The console's center of the base.

874
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:57,950
Oh, it's like the little hub.

875
00:57:58,450 --> 00:57:58,810
Okay.

876
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:04,490
You know, if you're serious about going up against the Axiom, you've got to get your equipment in order.

877
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,050
Join my gym and become a fighter.

878
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:09,930
You get gear and I make money.

879
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:10,850
It's a win-win.

880
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:12,890
Oh, you're like, you want to be my manager?

881
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:15,470
I don't have time for that.

882
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:18,410
I have a successful business to run.

883
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:22,230
I'll go back to my passion.

884
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:23,730
Fast food.

885
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:26,650
Yeah, fight clever.

886
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,050
Everyone is Iron Man.

887
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:29,630
Hey, old man.

888
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:34,030
Well, if it isn't Ash, what brings you in today?

889
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,110
That was just...

890
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:37,250
Hold up.

891
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:38,830
That suits an axe.

892
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:40,490
Who the hell is that?

893
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:41,850
I'm Don of the Crown.

894
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:43,810
Hold on, hold on.

895
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:46,090
Don't go flying off the handle right off the bat.

896
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:48,910
Let's hear it, Forge.

897
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:50,230
Hey, Angel.

898
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:52,290
She's a refugee from up above.

899
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:57,350
I know what you're thinking, but I would have been in Immortal's lunch if it weren't for this lifesaver.

900
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:01,650
I don't know the details, but they're trying to crush the axiom.

901
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:04,390
Something about a friend still up there.

902
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,070
I like how that...

903
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:10,410
I'm trying to save a guy that I literally met for, like, three minutes.

904
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:12,590
There's more to them than me.

905
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,550
There's no way she built an emotional connection with him already.

906
00:59:16,110 --> 01:00:11,630
true Toby yeah she really saved us she said she's gonna go back up to the garden crush those bastards and rescue her friend you expect us to it's his own fault for overclocking his RAM GPU and CPU he has to live with his mistakes I told him not to do it I was like bro that's a pre-building it's not meant to handle that bro you crazy you can't overclock a pre-built new equipment and money i'm for sale and you're buying huh just who the hell do you think you are are you telling me you're worth the cost i'm worth more than a hundred of you just wanted to play it on max and you watch me i'll take you on either one of you me i can take you That's like,

907
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:12,710
bring it on!

908
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:15,050
I don't need my arsenal.

909
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:19,150
Oh my god, I'm so cocky.

910
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:25,290
This is the face of someone in a multi-billion dollar.

911
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:30,770
This is the face of someone who owns a multi-billionaire, billion-based business.

912
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:34,850
Yeah, I don't like this guy.

913
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,890
I'm sure you won't have any problem with that.

914
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:38,970
I'm about to clown on him.

915
01:00:42,360 --> 01:01:09,500
that's right get over here oh wait I have no sword wait this is not fair I don't have a sword actually wait actually it's fair I can literally just yeah oh man too bad too bad you don't have any ring

916
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,980
Yeah, what are you doing, bro?

917
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:16,760
What?

918
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:18,500
Give me a sec.

919
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:19,260
Oh, my God.

920
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,960
He's shooting his own gun.

921
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,520
Okay, that's fine.

922
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,120
Wait, that's illegal.

923
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:26,640
Oh, my God.

924
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,440
Wait, that's illegal.

925
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,220
I didn't know he had a gun, too.

926
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,740
That is not fair.

927
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:36,290
That is not fair.

928
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:38,170
That's it.

929
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:39,370
Oh, my God.

930
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:40,610
I have to reload.

931
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:41,810
It's bad.

932
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:43,970
That's bad.

933
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,010
That's bad.

934
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:48,970
That's actually bad.

935
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:50,090
Oh, no.

936
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:54,430
No, he wasn't supposed to win this!

937
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:56,690
Oh, no.

938
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:58,610
Oh, no.

939
01:01:58,810 --> 01:01:59,330
I'm throwing.

940
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:00,210
No!

941
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,440
No!

942
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,120
He used the gun!

943
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:11,700
Where I can heal?

944
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,360
Oh, I didn't realize I can heal.

945
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,240
Okay.

946
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,860
Okay, I figured it out.

947
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:23,680
It's fine.

948
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:24,800
It's fine.

949
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,200
He doesn't use sword.

950
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,260
He doesn't use gun yet, so I can just slowly back out.

951
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:31,860
I can just cheese him like this.

952
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,040
What am I doing?

953
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,160
Am I supposed to be impressed?

954
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:37,860
All right.

955
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:42,640
I know that he activates gun in second phase, so I can literally...

956
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,180
Okay, there we go.

957
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,340
What the fuck?

958
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:45,860
Okay.

959
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:46,820
That's illegal.

960
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,500
Okay, that's fine.

961
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:53,120
Okay, reload, reload.

962
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,680
Oh, he has sword out.

963
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,680
He has sword out again.

964
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:07,420
Oh, no.

965
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:07,960
Oh, no.

966
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:11,880
It's fine.

967
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:13,900
I figured it out.

968
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,320
There you go.

969
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:17,620
Wow, that was awesome.

970
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:18,860
What am I doing?

971
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:20,400
Pulls out gun.

972
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:23,380
Good job.

973
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,640
A perfect bout.

974
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,120
Yay.

975
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,980
All I had to do was just walk away.

976
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:30,460
Here we go.

977
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:32,580
All right.

978
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:33,620
Now we're talking.

979
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,780
We're overloaded with inquiries.

980
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:39,080
Makes sense, though, after a bout like that.

981
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,880
We're gonna be real.

982
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,240
Okay, look, I forgot to grab the knife, okay?

983
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,760
I literally only have my fist and a gun.

984
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:48,940
I forgot to grab the knife on the other dead body.

985
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,940
So I only have one.

986
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:56,060
I accidentally nerfed myself.

987
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,080
You can't make enough dough through bouts alone.

988
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:03,000
So you advertise your mercenary skills by fighting in the Coliseum.

989
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:05,360
I didn't realize there were two dead bodies, okay?

990
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:11,150
Sure.

991
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:13,730
I like being a mercenary for hire.

992
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:17,530
Stroking choke for it is not doing so hot.

993
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:19,170
Shit, thank you for the super chat.

994
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:20,310
Thank you.

995
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:22,930
Just leave it to me.

996
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:28,610
Never bring a name to a gunfight.

997
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,070
That was quite the show.

998
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:31,890
God damn freak.

999
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:33,250
She's an outer.

1000
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:33,950
Whoa!

1001
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,210
I don't care how strong she is.

1002
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:36,290
I don't trust her.

1003
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:36,910
Hello?

1004
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:37,790
Look.

1005
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:41,730
Just cause I have, just cause I'm a clown.

1006
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:44,070
Doesn't mean I don't deserve rights.

1007
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:46,190
I guess you've got a point of standing out like she does.

1008
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:49,870
I guess you've got a point about that.

1009
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:51,070
Excuse you.

1010
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:54,410
I run a successful business.

1011
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:57,570
Fine.

1012
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:00,530
You've proven your worth, so we'll buy your skills.

1013
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:04,990
You work for us from now until you're fired or dead.

1014
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:07,850
Hey, that's not your decision to make.

1015
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:08,870
I'll explain later.

1016
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:10,510
I'm Angel.

1017
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:11,650
Rain Angel.

1018
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:16,050
For reference, I'm the acting commander of the Reclaimer's old fort branch.

1019
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:18,810
Class deserves rights too.

1020
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:23,610
Dawn on.

1021
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:25,170
What?

1022
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:30,150
If you stab us in the back, I'll kill you without a second thought.

1023
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:31,350
Got that.

1024
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:33,530
How can you kill one without a sword?

1025
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:38,210
I might not have a sword, but I deserve rights.

1026
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:39,870
Well, I got a little dicey there.

1027
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:42,130
But I'm glad it's all settled now.

1028
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:43,550
We'll see about that.

1029
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:44,710
We sure will.

1030
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:49,250
Damn, that guy...

1031
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:52,410
That guy that is so cocky after I beat him.

1032
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:54,270
First try.

1033
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:57,010
You can now develop equipment from the base console.

1034
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:59,230
Okay, I need a knife.

1035
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:01,550
Alright, mission.

1036
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:03,810
Go ahead and use the terminal over there to check on.

1037
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:05,570
The mission menu allows you to check and accept...

1038
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:07,310
Alright, let's accept some missions here.

1039
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:12,130
Uh, a bio in here for it that was previously used by has become too dangerous.

1040
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:13,230
Set and more.

1041
01:06:13,290 --> 01:06:15,970
Okay, that's just killing the big dogs.

1042
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:17,570
The Michael Bay dogs.

1043
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,590
And then what else do I have?

1044
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:21,150
Hangar?

1045
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:23,170
Okay.

1046
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:24,070
What's that?

1047
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:25,570
Oh!

1048
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:30,170
Oh, so there are, like, attachments that I can use.

1049
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:32,530
I know I have, like...

1050

Okay, I don't have any shoulder weapon.

1079
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:20,130

1081
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:25,850

1091
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:51,750
I'll be invisible.

1092
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:55,750
They'll never know.

1093
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:56,930

1101
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:16,050
They'll never know.

1102
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,410
They'll just see a random D just floating out.

1103
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:19,970

1178
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:00,920
They're like my performers at my birthday party.

1179
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,640
It's time to go to my first mission.

1180

01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:30,670

1231
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:31,490
We're both of us.

1232
01:18:31,530 --> 01:18:32,090

1235
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:12,530

1236
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:15,950
Silly me for thinking we're equal.

1237
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:19,690
Oh, did I go the wrong way?

1238
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:24,670
Yeah, I went the wrong way.

1239
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:29,130
Oops.

1240
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:31,310
Sorry.

1241
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:33,530
I don't know what I'm doing.

1242
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,520
My bad.

1243
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,560
Guys, do you know where...

1244
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,740
Guys, let me look at the map.

1245
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:47,000
Okay.

1246
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:47,740
Okay.

1247
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,340
I went the wrong way.

1248
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:51,940
It's actually...

1249
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:56,420
Um...

1250
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:57,900
How do I get inside?

1251
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:02,720
How did I take the elevator and still went the wrong way?

1252
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,280
How do I...

1253
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:07,900
Oh, there we go.

1254
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,480
Wait, this cannot...

1255
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,380
Wait, I have a request pending approval?

1256
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:15,480
Oh.

1257
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:18,340
Oh, you chose the right way.

1258
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,700
Oh, yeah, don't give me the map.

1259
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:25,840
I should not be in charge of the map, guys.

1260
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,320
I didn't know there were two...

1261
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,920
I thought my fast travel only had one travel.

1262
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:33,740
Not two.

1263
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,540
Wait, what do you guys look like?

1264
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:37,520

01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:39,640

1266
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,160
Okay, uh, try-hards?

1267
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:54,080

1272
01:21:41,290 --> 01:21:44,050
I'm not Donald McReynolds.

1273
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:48,360
Wait.

1274
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,780
You have a request to gather.

1275
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:52,700
Yeah, accept it.

1276
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:54,180
Accept my quest, guys.

1277
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,980
Hey, sorry for the trouble.

1278
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,300
Double trouble.

1279
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:00,080
What?

1280
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:01,540
I'll get right to it.

1281
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:04,080
There's something I want you to get rid of for me.

1282
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:04,820
An immortal.

1283
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,180
We're gonna nab lots of good parts from it.

1284
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:14,110
Head for the targets.

1285
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:14,810
location.

1286
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:17,670
Alright, let's see.

1287
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:18,350
Oh, we gotta go.

1288
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:19,330
Oh, we gotta talk to her.

1289
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:21,470
What's this?

1290
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,410
I'm Savetta, the head of engineering with the Reclaimers.

1291
01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:26,190
Let's skip the formalities.

1292
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:29,890
I would like you to gather immortal parts for me.

1293
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:30,830
We didn't do that.

1294
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:37,590
As immortals have evolved in myriad ways, so too have their parts become precious treasures in turn.

1295
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:43,730
As such, they're valuable commodities at the fort, and Reclaimers often process them for resources.

1296
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:46,390
I'll see what I can do.

1297
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:50,030
Once you've gathered a sufficient amount, come talk to me.

1298
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:53,230
See, once we gathered, guys, did you hear that?

1299
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:58,450
Alright, I signed the task to, I have delegated the task to my employees.

1300
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:03,310
Alright, make sure you do the task, guys.

1301
01:23:03,410 --> 01:23:05,090
I am just a supervisor.

1302
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:08,970
I'm here to supervise.

1303
01:23:12,810 --> 01:23:22,670
Guys, we are a family here in in the Donald McReynolds restaurant And in a wait who's this guy?

1304
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:25,590

1309
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:42,530
We got a car.

1310
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:47,270
I found one that swallowed a whole Arsenal now that one made me some good money.

1311
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:47,830
It's okay.

1312
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:50,450
I can drive Give me a sec.

1313
01:23:50,790 --> 01:23:52,250
So it's all for the money.

1314
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:53,650
What's wrong with making money?

1315
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:54,630
Alright, here you go.

1316
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:55,270
Okay.

Wait, you got a horse too?

1319
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:01,490

Alright, let's turn over.

1321
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:04,250
Animals in the past.

1322
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:06,290
But the femto caused him to mutate.

1323
01:24:06,730 --> 01:24:08,110
Might sound strange, but...

1324
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:10,250
Oh, guys, someone helped.

1325
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:12,950

01:26:48,330 --> 01:26:49,790
Alright, we go this way.

1381
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:53,550

How do we get there?

1383
01:26:57,870 --> 01:26:59,290
Guys, am I going the wrong way?

1384
01:26:59,730 --> 01:27:01,010
Oh, I went the wrong way.

1385
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:01,650
It's okay.

1386
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:05,310
This is what happens when you make me figure out how to...

1387
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:07,330
When you make me be the GPS, guys.

1388
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:10,050
I don't have the GPS installed on my...

1389
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:11,450
on my arsenal.

1390
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:16,830

1394
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:38,630
Just maybe.

1395
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:42,050
Flying might be a lot easier than driving.

1396
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:46,870
Alright, we're almost there though.

1397
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:48,270
It's like a thousand.

1398
01:27:48,550 --> 01:28:17,850
I will make it work look it's not about whether or not it's faster it's about the status symbol okay this this truck was like this truck cost me like seven employees I fired for budget reasons okay like we had to downsize okay and and by downsizing I was able to afford this truck

1399
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:24,530
All right, we're here.

1400
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:26,490
We're here.

1401
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:28,410
How do I get out?

1402
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:30,010
Okay, there you go.

1403
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:32,390
Where is the mission?

1404
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:33,490
Is he up top?

1405
01:28:34,990 --> 01:28:36,110
Is he over there?

1406
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:39,250
No, now it's too real.

1407
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:44,050
Oh, we gotta save money, okay?

1408
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:47,290
And by saving money, I had to buy this truck.

1409
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:50,570
Where is he?

1410
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:51,970
Oh, he's over there.

1411
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:59,050
My teammates are like, at the point of laser pointed, but look, please.

1412
01:28:59,550 --> 01:29:01,990

1413
01:29:02,330 --> 01:29:02,630
Please.

1414
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:06,070
Okay, I found him.

1415
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:07,530
Guys, I did it.

1416
01:29:07,630 --> 01:29:08,690
We're a team.

1417
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:09,770
Alright.

1418
01:29:10,870 --> 01:29:12,250
We did it, guys.

1419
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:13,310
We did it together.

1420
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:15,610
Right, right.

1421
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:16,610
What is it?

1422
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:17,830

Thank you.

1428
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:21,990
This is why I get paid four times more than the regular employee.

1429
01:30:22,710 --> 01:30:24,830
Resolve doesn't pull that trigger.

1430
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:28,330
Enough of this nonsense.

1431
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:37,080
It's a hard job supervising, guys.

1432
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:39,220
It was such a hard job.

1433
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:43,720
Alright, let's see.

1434
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:45,060
Oh my god, legs!

1435
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:50,360
It does have more defense, but less HP.

1436
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,760
Uh, no, it's not worth it.

1437
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,420
It's, like, slower, too.

1438
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:56,240
He has such bad legs.

1439
01:30:56,980 --> 01:30:57,640

1451
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:43,180

1455
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:21,080
Oh, wait, there's a new helmet.

1456
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:23,500

He rode the horse.

01:35:18,990 --> 01:35:20,250
You should have rode that horse.

Oh, that's the immortal.

That's the one.

1508
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:47,000
It's a troop class.

1509
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:50,840
It's not him though.

1510
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:52,360
Not who?

1511
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:54,300

Yay!

1524
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,520
Coco, Jagoon Rangers.

1525
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:34,100
I'm helping.

1526
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:37,340
All me.

1527
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,660
As a supervisor, I take 100% credit.

1528
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:42,580
Okay.

1529
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,280
Rest now.

1530
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:48,740
May your next life be kinder to you.

1531
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:55,160
What?

1532
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:56,940
What?

1533
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:58,960
Employees!

1534
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:00,120
Take the death!

1535
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:01,800
It's

1536
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,000
bodyguards!

1537
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:07,940
What's going on?

1538
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:09,600
I've never seen that before.

1539
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:12,200
I'm not sure.

1540
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:16,480
I actually did something, guys.

1541
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:18,580
You're right.

1542
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:19,900
Hey, can you stand?

1543
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:21,760
Yes.

1544
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:24,860
I've got a bad feeling.

1545
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:27,640
What did he do to me?

1546
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:30,400
Oh my god, do I have insurance?

1547
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:35,280
Guys, I don't know if I have insurance.

1548
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:39,140
Don't put me in, don't put me in the hospital.

1549
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:43,580
The lab's this way.

1550
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,000
The results are in.

1551
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:49,960
Looks like what you just experienced was a fusion.

1552
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:50,700
Hmm.

1553
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:52,380
Somewhere hunch was right.

1554
01:37:52,400 --> 01:38:13,500
What is it fusion is when one immortal absorbs another what I'd heard this could happen with outers too in theory since both of them are femtovariants But just what does that mean in lane they do the immortal is alive it's just living on inside you more specifically It means its gene is alive.

1555
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:30,660
Oh my god I'm a bacteria living inside me I have those like worms Those bacteria were over and over so they can become stronger if we go by that logic Maybe you can get stronger in the same way.

1556
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:34,960
Oh parasite the parasitic worm reasoning it's possible.

1557
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,580
Yes, I don't think I die.

1558
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,660
Don't don't do that by the way.

1559
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:46,740
You don't do This is not funny I have a parasitic worm

1560
01:38:53,100 --> 01:39:29,140
It's not funny guys what the fuck why did i start tripping there's a factor you're taking to the lab to activate it you can obtain fusion skills based on a genetic combination inside the factor you can reset your body by paying credits immortal yeah i have tape work uh next thing thank you super chat thank you thank you genius can be characterized to skeleton might and shell a different combinations which affects the type of skill you can obtain discover factors are registered to the copedium where genetic information can be checked at any time.

1561
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:31,780
Activate during the tutorial?

1562
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:32,700
Sure.

1563
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:35,340
Select what to activate.

1564
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:37,500
Why can't we activate this?

1565
01:39:38,380 --> 01:39:41,800
Auto dodge, helm splitter, stun resistance.

1566
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:43,220
Oh, I have all of these.

1567
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:44,000
Okay.

1568
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:46,400
Be forced to change in your other looks.

1569
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:47,080
This phenomenon.

1570
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:53,940
Oh, this is like the more um, the more I uh, what is it called?

1571
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:59,260
The more I let my parasitic tapeworm grow, the less human I become.

1572
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:04,540
Can be treated by...

1573
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,060
You'll be able to change the look.

1574
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:10,000
Why would I ever pay to change how I look?

1575
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:11,260
Agnes will attempt mutation.

1576
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:11,760
Yes.

1577
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:17,740
My entire mecha is just gonna cover my body anyways.

1578
01:40:17,780 --> 01:40:18,580
Does it really matter?

1579
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:22,940
What did it do?

1580
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:28,920
Immortal...

1581
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:31,780
By activating Immortal Factors, you...

1582
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:35,120
9% clown, 1% word.

1583
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:42,380
You can unleash the weapon players can be improved upon using all skills.

1584
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:43,960
What changed?

1585
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:46,560
I look the same.

1586
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:50,060
What's my mutation?

1587
01:40:53,550 --> 01:40:55,450
These are three types of skills.

1588
01:40:55,610 --> 01:40:58,410
Each has different qualities that can be Equip weapon actions.

1589
01:40:58,570 --> 01:41:00,430
One skill can equip her weapon category.

1590
01:41:03,210 --> 01:41:04,770
Equip skills during the tutorial?

1591
01:41:04,930 --> 01:41:05,470
Yeah, sure.

1592
01:41:07,130 --> 01:41:08,170
I'll equip that.

1593
01:41:09,630 --> 01:41:10,310
Helm splitter.

1594
01:41:11,090 --> 01:41:11,790
Oh, shit.

1595
01:41:11,890 --> 01:41:13,050
That looks badass.

1596
01:41:14,670 --> 01:41:16,050
Is that it?

1597
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:23,600
Oh, it's like each weapon I can change it.

1598
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:24,140
Oh!

1599
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:26,660
What's my passive?

1600
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:27,540
Sun resistance?

1601
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:28,420
Sure.

1602
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:31,760
Is my eyes red?

1603
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:33,440
I don't think it is.

1604
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:35,760
I think that's just my regular eye.

1605
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:39,080
I think that's just how I'm supposed to look like.

1606
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:40,840
And that was originally there.

1607
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:43,740
I don't know what they change.

1608
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:50,400
Alright.

1609
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,780
I just gotta be more of a mutant, I guess.

1610
01:41:54,660 --> 01:41:55,620
Thousand Cuts.

1611
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:57,500
Wait, is Fusion Skillless?

1612
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:58,860
Oh, I don't have any of that yet.

1613
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:04,840
That's like where I got it from.

1618
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:52,420

Is that the mutation?

1622
01:42:58,060 --> 01:42:58,420
Wait!

1623
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:01,000
Why would I pay to remove that?

1624
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:02,820
That shit looks badass!

1625
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:04,140
What the fuck?

1626
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:05,480

1630
01:43:09,820 --> 01:43:10,900
Bro, do you have a tail?

1631
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:12,880
Got a fucking tail.

1632
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:15,440
That's so cool.

1633
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:22,020
Why would I ever want to remove any of that?

1634
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,740
To look normie as hell?

1635
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,880
Where could I get that mutation?

1636
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:36,100
Yeah, she gets a goddamn cybertail.

1637
01:43:36,180 --> 01:43:38,780
I need you to lend us a hand.

1638
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:40,920
It's time we went and rescued our commander.

1639
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:41,740
Oh my god.

1640
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:45,800
Their tapeworms are better than my tapeworm.

1641
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,060
I showed you my mutations.

1642
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,600

Wait, you guys could have given your scraps instead of making me pay?

1661

Let me know if you gather any more parts in the future.

1662
01:45:08,890 --> 01:45:11,990
I know we don't help directly on the battlefield, but we'd like to...

1663

We have a shared bank account, guys.

1667

This is a family.

1668
01:45:21,230 --> 01:45:24,330
Everything you earn goes into one shared account.

1669
01:45:26,710 --> 01:45:27,510

Yay!

1694
01:47:22,970 --> 01:47:24,130
Ice cream time!

1695
01:47:25,070 --> 01:47:27,050
You can buy ice cream at the ice cream parlor.

1696
01:47:27,210 --> 01:47:28,690
Eating ice cream can get bonuses.

1697
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:30,410
Each flavor has a different...

1698
01:47:30,410 --> 01:47:32,230
You can earn stamps by buying ice cream.

1699
01:47:32,410 --> 01:47:34,390
I can get a stamp card!

1700
01:47:35,650 --> 01:47:37,030
I'll get a double scoop.

1701
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:38,270
Wait, why is double scoop?

1702
01:47:38,890 --> 01:47:40,950
In fact, worse than single.

1703
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:43,830
Double has two.

1704
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:45,510
Wait, how much money do I have?

1705
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:49,250
Oh, the vanilla has little polar bear ears.

1706
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:50,710
That is so cute.

1707
01:47:52,730 --> 01:47:55,590
I don't know what the power-ups do, but I'm going to get vanilla.

1708
01:47:56,450 --> 01:47:59,270
And then I'm going to eat it in a waffle cone.

1709
01:48:01,050 --> 01:48:01,490
Purchase.

1710
01:48:02,950 --> 01:48:03,390
Yay!

1711
01:48:05,370 --> 01:48:06,970
Oh my god, what do I do?

1712
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:08,630
Can I not be purchased?

1713
01:48:09,910 --> 01:48:11,350
Oh, I can't have a...

1714
01:48:11,350 --> 01:48:12,850
Oh, wait, what's my effect right now?

1715
01:48:12,950 --> 01:48:14,230
Arrow Emergency Dodge.

1716
01:48:14,670 --> 01:48:17,270
Oh, I can only eat, like, one scoop for every effect.

1717
01:48:19,490 --> 01:48:19,830
Yay!

1718
01:48:20,110 --> 01:48:21,790
I got my ice cream!

1719
01:48:22,890 --> 01:48:23,270
Yay!

1720
01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:26,910
It's like a pizza party, but instead we're having an ice cream party.

1721
01:48:28,390 --> 01:48:28,690
Alright.

1722
01:48:29,490 --> 01:48:30,650
Someone do the map.

1723
01:48:30,930 --> 01:48:32,190
Just in case I mess up.

1724
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:33,510
I don't trust myself.

1725
01:48:33,990 --> 01:48:35,430
Someone else do the elevator.

1726
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:37,310
Come on.

1727
01:48:37,990 --> 01:48:38,870
I know you guys.

1728
01:48:38,890 --> 01:48:39,910
guys can do it.

1729
01:48:44,670 --> 01:48:45,590
Wait, what?

1730
01:48:46,370 --> 01:48:46,730
Okay.

1731
01:48:47,670 --> 01:48:48,210
Approve.

1732
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:53,410
Oh, two scoops gives you two effects, but it was like...

1733
01:48:53,410 --> 01:48:56,290
Oh, that's why the duration is shorter.

1734
01:48:56,570 --> 01:48:58,090
Oh, that makes sense.

1735
01:48:58,130 --> 01:48:58,730
I was like, wondering.

1736
01:48:58,830 --> 01:49:00,610
I was like, why does...

1737
01:49:00,610 --> 01:49:05,310
How come, like, two scoops does, like...

1738
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:39,850
Has, like, shorter duration if I'm eating double the ice we secure him we escape via the unused road we're expecting reinforcements right in the vehicle unused road what vehicle from the past but it's basically our backyard it's the best place to get the axes off your tail if you're in a pinch oh yeah who even cares just watch our backs all right cool it ash we know that raven's being transferred from the gloom death's prison to the orbital Orbital elevator?

1739
01:49:39,850 --> 01:49:41,330
You're scared with the team this small.

1740
01:49:42,450 --> 01:49:43,330
That's why...

1741
01:49:43,330 --> 01:49:47,390
We're gonna secure Raven inside the underground tunnel that connects to the unused road.

1742
01:49:47,910 --> 01:49:49,850
So, it's a race against time.

1743
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:51,190
We need way more time.

1744
01:49:51,190 --> 01:49:53,110
Who's in a fight right now?

1745
01:49:53,590 --> 01:49:53,930
What?

1746
01:49:54,910 --> 01:49:55,730
Oh my god!

1747
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:57,850
What is that over there?

1748
01:49:58,110 --> 01:49:59,350
You'll get your money's worth.

1749
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:01,970
What is he doing there?

1750
01:50:02,810 --> 01:50:03,750
Wait, is that...

1751
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:04,610
Is that them?

1752
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:05,570
We've got this!

1753
01:50:06,550 --> 01:50:07,630
Now's my chance!

1754
01:50:07,670 --> 01:50:08,870
Who's fighting over there?

1755
01:50:08,890 --> 01:50:38,190

1756
01:50:41,630 --> 01:50:42,290
Okay.

1757
01:50:43,390 --> 01:50:44,970
I'm slowly floating over.

1758
01:50:45,130 --> 01:50:46,550
Wait, what kind of loot does he have?

1759
01:50:48,290 --> 01:50:48,510
Oh!

1760
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:52,610
Oh, more tapeworms!

1761
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:55,610
We'll grab that.

1762
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:57,530
We gotta get...

1763
01:50:57,530 --> 01:50:59,870
I won't be just as cool as these guys.

1764
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:04,030
Alright, we gotta ride in the vehicle.

1765
01:51:06,410 --> 01:51:08,390
Okay, it is...

1766
01:51:08,890 --> 01:51:10,210
Alright, let's go this way.

1767
01:51:10,990 --> 01:51:12,690
All the way over here.

1768
01:51:13,910 --> 01:51:15,210
We got this.

1769
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:21,130
We're almost there.

1770
01:51:23,070 --> 01:51:23,470
I believe.

1771
01:51:23,690 --> 01:51:32,550
Oh, I think like if one of the teammates get there before I get there, he can activate the mission for us.

1772
01:51:34,210 --> 01:51:34,310
Yay!

1773
01:51:34,890 --> 01:51:36,650
More tapeworms in that belly!

1774
01:51:37,170 --> 01:51:38,870
Then I can grow my own tapeworms.

1775
01:51:38,890 --> 01:51:39,290
Yeah!

1776
01:51:42,770 --> 01:51:45,550
He made it!

1777
01:51:46,210 --> 01:51:49,010
Angel, are HQ's reinforcements here?

1778
01:51:49,430 --> 01:51:50,550
No, not yet.

1779
01:51:51,110 --> 01:51:52,470
We can't wait any longer.

1780
01:51:53,130 --> 01:51:53,410
Mm-hmm.

1781
01:51:53,970 --> 01:51:55,610
Looks like we're doing this on our own.

1782
01:51:56,010 --> 01:51:57,010
Remember our vow!

1783
01:51:57,590 --> 01:51:59,290
Everyone have your roles memorized.

1784
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:00,590
We're going in.

1785
01:52:00,930 --> 01:52:01,530
What do we do?

1786
01:52:01,590 --> 01:52:02,390
Wait, I didn't remember.

1787
01:52:05,650 --> 01:52:08,030
Damn, my tapeworm's gonna help me grow a tail.

1788
01:52:08,230 --> 01:52:08,870
Oh my god, there's sheep.

1789
01:52:08,890 --> 01:52:40,210

1790
01:52:40,430 --> 01:52:49,390
they're all dead Nice They're just there for They're just like cannon fodder What the?

1791
01:52:49,530 --> 01:52:59,770
They're in the trees They're in the tree Oh my god What are these gorilla tactics How do they know to hide in the trees

1792
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:11,210
Oh my god There's a guy right there Peep-peep-peep-peep-peep-peep-oh it's over here eat it.

1793
01:53:11,710 --> 01:53:12,510
Don't worry, I got this.

1794
01:53:13,430 --> 01:53:14,130
Not as bad.

1795
01:53:14,250 --> 01:53:15,010
Wait, I took damage.

1796
01:53:15,110 --> 01:53:16,450
Oh, it's they're behind me, aren't they?

1797
01:53:19,790 --> 01:53:20,590
The trees.

1798
01:53:20,990 --> 01:53:21,710
What do they say?

1799
01:53:21,730 --> 01:53:23,150
I can't get lazy yet.

1800
01:53:26,510 --> 01:53:29,950
Oh, my God, my turret sensitivity is so, so low.

1801
01:53:30,410 --> 01:53:37,450
I... Every turn is me going through my entire mouse pad.

1802
01:53:38,050 --> 01:53:40,090
That's how slow my turret is.

1803
01:53:40,450 --> 01:53:42,550
Okay, I should up the speed on my turret.

1804
01:53:42,910 --> 01:53:44,630
I, oh my god.

1805
01:53:45,370 --> 01:53:47,210
This is me trying to turn my mouse.

1806
01:53:47,550 --> 01:53:54,670
It's like, I need to change that keyboard settings.

1807
01:53:54,910 --> 01:53:56,310
Oh my god, where's the gameplay?

1808
01:53:56,650 --> 01:53:59,270
Let's grab the, let's put the turret higher.

1809
01:54:00,590 --> 01:54:03,030
I think the turret needs to be a little higher.

1810
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:06,870
Those scum, they did some damage to the vehicle.

1811
01:54:07,170 --> 01:54:08,590
Okay, that feels a lot better.

1812
01:54:10,450 --> 01:54:11,910
I think we can.

1813
01:54:14,330 --> 01:54:15,650
Okay, it's sort of better.

1814
01:54:16,010 --> 01:54:16,830
It's not the best.

1815
01:54:16,910 --> 01:54:18,610
It's a little, it's an improvement.

1816
01:54:19,150 --> 01:54:21,910
It's just, it's an improvement to what it was up for.

1817
01:54:23,790 --> 01:54:24,670
I'm turning.

1818
01:54:25,110 --> 01:54:26,350
I'm turning, guys.

1819
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:27,110
I'm turning.

1820
01:54:29,290 --> 01:54:32,550
Oh my god, did I accidentally do the controller instead of the mouse and keyboard?

1821
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:33,550
It's fine.

1822
01:54:35,570 --> 01:54:38,830
By the time we make it, all right.

1823
01:54:39,590 --> 01:54:40,130
There we go.

1824
01:54:40,450 --> 01:54:41,310
Oh, there it is.

1825
01:54:42,930 --> 01:54:43,530
There we go.

1826
01:54:44,410 --> 01:54:45,670
That should help now.

1827
01:54:48,430 --> 01:54:48,590
All right.

1828
01:54:49,150 --> 01:54:49,870
There we go.

1829
01:54:50,130 --> 01:54:52,010
I can finally turn a little bit more.

1830
01:54:52,510 --> 01:54:53,410
Oh, we made it.

1831
01:54:53,410 --> 01:54:54,130
Let's regroup.

1832
01:54:54,870 --> 01:54:55,030
Oh.

1833
01:54:55,930 --> 01:54:56,490
All right.

1834
01:54:56,650 --> 01:54:57,150
That's cool.

1835
01:54:57,290 --> 01:54:57,950
We made it.

1836
01:55:02,210 --> 01:55:03,090
We died.

1837
01:55:03,570 --> 01:55:04,430
I fixed it.

1838
01:55:04,910 --> 01:55:05,870
And then we made it.

1839
01:55:05,950 --> 01:55:07,130
And then the level's done.

1840
01:55:09,450 --> 01:55:10,430
That's a lot of them.

1841
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:42,870
This is the sovereign axiom To the suspicious vehicle Reduce your speed and stand by You can't tell me what to do I have my rights Exactly You know what's up, Ash I like to see you try I have my employees in the front At best I get hit last We are alive Thanks for the warm welcome!

1842
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:45,750
Ash, shoot the damning bullet!

1843
01:55:46,210 --> 01:55:47,130
Hey, your turn.

1844
01:55:47,490 --> 01:55:48,130
Get in there!

1845
01:55:48,850 --> 01:55:50,310
Don't let us down now!

1846
01:55:54,530 --> 01:55:55,290
Yay!

1847
01:55:55,550 --> 01:55:56,610
We did it!

1848
01:55:56,730 --> 01:55:57,590
My shields!

1849
01:55:58,510 --> 01:56:01,490
My... I have my bullet shields!

1850
01:56:02,470 --> 01:56:03,250
Take this!

1851
01:56:04,430 --> 01:56:06,470
I'm slowly heading over.

1852
01:56:07,670 --> 01:56:08,710
Don't worry.

1853
01:56:11,910 --> 01:56:12,650
Easy.

1854
01:56:14,170 --> 01:56:15,670
That's goddamn red.

1855
01:56:18,130 --> 01:56:20,070
I'm my meat shields in the front.

1856
01:56:23,050 --> 01:56:24,110
We're a family.

1857
01:56:25,850 --> 01:56:27,350
My minimum wage family.

1858
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:33,720
Oh, she.

1859
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:36,380
Oh, that's Raven.

1860
01:56:37,220 --> 01:56:38,060
You look like hell.

1861
01:56:38,540 --> 01:56:39,180
Can you breathe?

1862
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:41,980
Just enough to stay alive.

1863
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:42,980
Hang on.

1864
01:56:47,350 --> 01:56:48,470
Who's this?

1865
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:52,940
Who is she?

1866
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:54,600
Drop your weapon.

1867
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:55,780
Which one's Raven?

1868
01:56:56,060 --> 01:56:56,660
I'm not your enemy.

1869
01:56:57,780 --> 01:56:59,900
Besides, shouldn't escaping be your top priority?

1870
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:02,320
Oh, that's Raven.

1871
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:04,240
Yes, sir.

1872
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:06,920
I thought the girl was Raven.

1873
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:10,380
They've all got substantial injuries.

1874
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:13,720
No way we can get everyone out of here.

1875
01:57:16,740 --> 01:57:17,900
Wait, aren't he's a bad guy?

1876
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:49,240

Oh my god.

1878
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:51,160
I'll tell you later.

1879
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:53,080
We can't stay in chat here.

1880
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:54,040
Let's get out.

1881
01:57:54,220 --> 01:57:54,820
Quick, go!

1882
01:57:57,500 --> 01:57:59,600
Bro, that guy's a gamer.

1883
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:01,320
Guys!

1884
01:58:03,140 --> 01:58:04,780
That guy's a real gamer.

1885
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:05,920
Not gonna...

1886
01:58:06,900 --> 01:58:07,380
Alright.

1887
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:09,160
Alright, let me give you a sec.

1888
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:09,860
I got loot.

1889
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:11,100
Dragon?

1890
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:13,640
Who the fuck died here?

1891
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:14,060
Yoink?

1892
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:16,520
Imagine dying here.

1893
01:58:19,260 --> 01:58:21,540
Cover used for developing item.

1894
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:22,940
Tron.

1895
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:23,980
Yoink.

1896
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:25,440
My ammo now.

1897
01:58:26,980 --> 01:58:28,000
Oh, a shield.

1898
01:58:29,780 --> 01:58:30,720
I'll put that here.

1899
01:58:32,860 --> 01:58:32,920
Nice.

1900
01:58:33,220 --> 01:58:34,260
I don't think I need a shield.

1901
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:35,740
But I'll grab that for now.

1902
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:38,880
Nah, you don't have shit I want.

1903
01:58:40,060 --> 01:58:41,460
Uh, alright, here we go.

1904
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:43,380
Bro, that guy's a gamer.

1905
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:47,520
What trauma did he have with Vanotti?

1906
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:51,300
Hey guys.

1907
01:58:52,100 --> 01:58:52,820
Remember our vow.

1908
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:55,100
Everyone have your roles memorized.

1909
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:56,400
We're going in.

1910
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:00,100
Wait, wait.

1911
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:00,940
Why did I leave?

1912
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:02,280
Oh, that's you guys.

1913
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:03,600
Wait, where's my car?

1914
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:04,740
Wait, guys?

1915
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:10,420
Wait, you guys are...

1916
01:59:10,420 --> 01:59:10,820
Guys?

1917
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:12,960
How did you get...

1918
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:15,480
Guys, what about me?

1919
01:59:16,620 --> 01:59:17,740
How do I get in the...

1920
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:17,900
Guys, I'm not...

1921
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:19,480
Because I want to get in the car.

1922
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:22,920
I let by.

1923
01:59:24,260 --> 01:59:24,980
It's not fair.

1924
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:27,180
Why don't I get to be on the car?

1925
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:28,220
Oh, wait.

1926
01:59:32,190 --> 01:59:33,710
It's time to walk.

1927
01:59:39,230 --> 01:59:40,670
I thought we were a teen.

1928
01:59:42,530 --> 01:59:44,650
Could we please get some answers now, Raven?

1929
01:59:45,170 --> 01:59:46,310
Like who that girl is?

1930
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:47,930
That's Iris.

1931
01:59:48,190 --> 01:59:49,630
She's a fighter sent by headquarters.

1932
01:59:53,710 --> 01:59:56,470
I should have had to report Ash to HR.

1933
01:59:57,210 --> 02:00:00,730
He's creating a very hostile environment for me.

1934
02:00:03,410 --> 02:00:04,310
More parasites!

1935
02:00:04,970 --> 02:00:06,290
Let's go!

1936
02:00:07,130 --> 02:00:10,430
Ash, Angel, take the vehicle and hurry back to base.

1937
02:00:10,970 --> 02:00:12,070
I'll handle the immortal.

1938
02:00:13,630 --> 02:00:14,730
Not like that, you won't.

1939
02:00:16,450 --> 02:00:16,910
Iris.

1940
02:00:18,630 --> 02:00:20,010
I'll take it on with her.

1941
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:20,670
Now go!

1942
02:00:26,070 --> 02:00:27,210
Wait, we can take it.

1943
02:00:27,450 --> 02:00:28,210
Oh, shit!

1944
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:30,270
You've got enough pep in you for another fight, don't you?

1945
02:00:30,330 --> 02:00:32,430
Wait, her arsenal is pretty badass.

1946
02:00:34,310 --> 02:00:34,930
I like her...

1947
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:36,190
She put clothes on it.

1948
02:00:36,690 --> 02:00:37,930
I feel like...

1949
02:00:37,930 --> 02:00:38,930
Okay, not gonna lie.

1950
02:00:39,490 --> 02:00:43,450
I feel like putting clothes on your arsenal seems like very counterintuitive.

1951
02:00:45,450 --> 02:00:45,930
Like...

1952
02:00:45,930 --> 02:00:47,230
Why does...

1953
02:00:47,230 --> 02:00:49,410
Why does your mecca need clothes?

1954
02:00:51,410 --> 02:00:52,310
Alright, don't worry.

1955
02:00:53,050 --> 02:00:53,630
I'm swinging.

1956
02:00:53,810 --> 02:00:57,170
I'm swinging my sword because it looks cool.

1957
02:00:57,570 --> 02:00:59,090
But does that mean...

1958
02:00:59,090 --> 02:01:01,010
Wait, does that mean we're naked?

1959
02:01:03,270 --> 02:01:07,070
Why does Iris's robot have clothes on?

1960
02:01:09,090 --> 02:01:10,710
It just looks cool.

1961
02:01:12,750 --> 02:01:13,890
I'll cut its tail.

1962
02:01:14,470 --> 02:01:16,970
Cut its tails and sell it for parts.

1963
02:01:18,410 --> 02:01:19,630
Nice, we did it.

1964
02:01:23,540 --> 02:01:24,980
What if it gets cool?

1965
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,320
Oh, dokey.

1966
02:01:30,380 --> 02:01:32,520
Where's my parasite?

1967
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:33,640
Yay!

1968
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:40,820
I don't want to discard anything.

1969
02:01:44,900 --> 02:01:45,640
Oh, no!

1970
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:48,620
Wait.

1971
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:55,140
There's a max?

1972
02:01:59,050 --> 02:02:00,690
Okay, we're gonna...

1973
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:02,750
We'll keep the spider one.

1974
02:02:02,850 --> 02:02:04,310
I think the spider one is cool.

1975
02:02:04,430 --> 02:02:05,430
I'll keep the spider.

1976
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:09,270
We gotta return to base.

1977
02:02:11,190 --> 02:02:11,530
Necro.

1978
02:02:11,910 --> 02:02:12,650
Go back to base.

1979
02:02:12,830 --> 02:02:13,430
So, wait.

1980
02:02:13,570 --> 02:02:14,790
Do I have to go back to base?

1981
02:02:14,930 --> 02:02:15,430
Or can you TP?

1982
02:02:15,750 --> 02:02:16,130
Necro.

1983
02:02:16,710 --> 02:02:17,250
Wait, actually.

1984
02:02:17,650 --> 02:02:19,210
Go back to base and TPS.

1985
02:02:20,730 --> 02:02:21,550
He's gone.

1986
02:02:25,670 --> 02:02:26,150
Um.

1987
02:02:26,410 --> 02:02:26,830
Necro.

1988
02:02:27,330 --> 02:02:29,710
You have to give me two weeks of notice.

1989
02:02:30,230 --> 02:02:31,290
Before you go.

1990
02:02:31,310 --> 02:03:05,930

1991
02:03:06,290 --> 02:03:08,930
You can't do this to him.

1992
02:03:11,270 --> 02:03:12,650
Wait, I'm doing my...

1993
02:03:12,650 --> 02:03:13,530
Give me a sec.

1994
02:03:15,010 --> 02:03:15,930
Wait, how come I'm stuck?

1995
02:03:16,070 --> 02:03:16,990
Oh my god, I'm...

1996
02:03:16,990 --> 02:03:17,970
Wait, give me a sec.

1997
02:03:18,490 --> 02:03:19,630
I'm doing my fusion.

1998
02:03:19,890 --> 02:03:21,010
I'm mutating.

1999
02:03:21,230 --> 02:03:22,130
Give me a sec.

2000
02:03:23,390 --> 02:03:23,510
Alright.

2001
02:03:27,670 --> 02:03:30,090
Yeah, but in Doki Lan, you got...

2002
02:03:31,710 --> 02:03:36,230
If you don't give your two weeks notice, the police comes.

2003
02:03:38,130 --> 02:03:39,570
All right, let's see.

2004
02:03:39,710 --> 02:03:42,610
How do I activate?

2005
02:03:43,630 --> 02:03:44,110
Yes.

2006
02:03:46,030 --> 02:03:47,630
Give me my mutations.

2007
02:03:49,990 --> 02:03:51,430
The tootsie thought.

2008
02:03:52,730 --> 02:03:53,470
Oh, shit.

2009
02:03:53,610 --> 02:03:54,050
There you go.

2010
02:03:54,190 --> 02:03:54,990
I'm getting my...

2011
02:03:56,790 --> 02:03:58,690
I'm getting mutations now.

2012
02:03:59,070 --> 02:03:59,390
Look at that.

2013
02:03:59,450 --> 02:04:01,290
Look at our sick-ass tattoos, guys.

2014
02:04:05,450 --> 02:04:08,230
All right, I want Haddon.

2015
02:04:08,990 --> 02:04:10,690
No, we're Haddon in our mission.

2016
02:04:11,790 --> 02:04:13,250
Wait, I said no.

2017
02:04:14,430 --> 02:04:16,510
Looks like we have a newcomer in our midst.

2018
02:04:16,910 --> 02:04:18,190
A reliable one too.

2019
02:04:18,330 --> 02:04:19,390
Now I'm the edge lord.

2020
02:04:20,730 --> 02:04:22,890
We had to get you back, so we had no choice.

2021
02:04:24,610 --> 02:04:27,910
We wouldn't have managed to pull off your rescue without her help.

2022
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:29,450
Thank you.

2023
02:04:30,050 --> 02:04:30,950
I'm in your debt.

2024
02:04:31,630 --> 02:04:32,990
I just work for what I'm paid.

2025
02:04:33,250 --> 02:04:34,410
Shut it.

2026
02:04:34,750 --> 02:04:35,710
Like, are you okay?

2027
02:04:35,850 --> 02:04:36,270
I'm okay.

2028
02:04:36,450 --> 02:04:37,250
It's just a flesh wound.

2029
02:04:37,490 --> 02:04:37,710
How about you?

2030
02:04:38,290 --> 02:04:39,970
It's just a little tapeworm.

2031
02:04:41,670 --> 02:04:41,970
No.

2032
02:04:42,350 --> 02:04:43,730
My orders are to stay here.

2033
02:04:45,250 --> 02:04:46,650
You've got to be kidding!

2034
02:04:47,090 --> 02:04:47,950
Another router?

2035
02:04:48,470 --> 02:04:50,570
Bro, what's wrong with you, bro?

2036
02:04:51,470 --> 02:04:54,250
Bro, get off Xbox, bro!

2037
02:04:56,990 --> 02:04:58,050
Guys, you didn't...

2038
02:04:58,050 --> 02:04:59,030
What happens now?

2039
02:04:59,570 --> 02:05:01,110
Orders came from HQ.

2040
02:05:01,630 --> 02:05:02,690
She'll be working here.

2041
02:05:03,570 --> 02:05:04,050
Chill!

2042
02:05:05,370 --> 02:05:09,250
And with that, my time as acting commander is over.

2043
02:05:10,190 --> 02:05:10,910
Welcome back, Raven.

2044
02:05:12,670 --> 02:05:13,730
Discord in the ranks.

2045
02:05:14,230 --> 02:05:16,110
The axiom would be an easy- Or he needs to meditate.

2046
02:05:16,770 --> 02:05:20,170
He needs- he needs a happy meal right now.

2047
02:05:20,350 --> 02:05:20,730
Yay!

2048
02:05:21,310 --> 02:05:22,450
All right, that was fun.

2049
02:05:22,610 --> 02:05:23,130
That was fun.

2050
02:05:23,590 --> 02:05:28,390
The rematch lets you fight against- Oh, okay, so if you want to like farm more mutations, you can use this.

2051
02:05:28,510 --> 02:05:29,230
Oh, that's cool.

2052
02:05:29,870 --> 02:05:33,170
Because I was gonna say I was able to grab the mutations earlier because of it.

02:08:53,790 --> 02:08:55,190
Wait, is this a T pose?
