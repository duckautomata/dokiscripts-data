right now like literally like right now uh my my uber eats

5
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:17,420
order guy delivery guy was late uh with my food it took him
much longer than i expected to to get my food um literally

6
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,740
arrived like 10 minutes before the stream was supposed to
start i was like okay guess i'll i'll eat on stream i'm so

7
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,300
hungry my stomach is growling um

8
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:37,620
Um, no, I didn't have anything to eat last night, um,
because I was busy, like, prepping for everything, so I was

9
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,520
just like, do I eat before, because I didn't want to get,
like, a tummy ache when I'm doing my VR chat thing, um, so

10
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:51,140
that's why I was like, oh, I'll just eat, I'll eat, like,
after the stream, and then obviously I passed up right after

11
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,240
the stream, and then I slept for, like, 10 plus hours.

12
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:59,020
Also, um, so we're just gonna eat, I'm, we're just gonna eat
a little bit before we go through the behind the scenes of

13
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,480
Tokyo!

14
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:10,160
though I would like to have some food in my stomach before
we go over everything because it's a lot of stuff like I

15
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:21,160
said this project took half a year um to come to life um and
uh has to be I will say this is the most expensive VR chat

16
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:29,700
world I've ever funded it was uh it's because like we like
they built it from the ground up so um so there was a lot of

17
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:40,380
people working on this um almost every day i'm having
hibachi but i'm not ordering from this place again it's not

18
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:51,600
the best hibachi place i wanted to try this new hibachi
place and i was like it's not very good i can't believe i

19
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,700
ordered from the one hibachi place that's like westernized
hibachi it's not like

20
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:11,120
like where there's more it's like westernized hibachi where
there's a a lack of flavor so like not enough you know like

21
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,600
okay Asian hibachi is basically where they just drenched the
entire thing with the sauce like the hibachi sauce like the

22
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:32,520
sweet sauce um they lack the sauce for this one so um so i'm
not very happy about that yeah i lost the Hibachi got you.

23
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,480
I, you know, I was like, you know what?

24
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,160
First day of the year?

25
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,860
Surely it's going to go well, right?

26
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,100
Surely, surely, you know, my first meal of the year would be
okay.

27
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,780
I should have had a feeling.

28
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:55,600
I should have had, okay, the thing is, I should have had a,
okay, I usually go to this other Hibachi place, which is

29
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,300
like my favorite childhood Hibachi place, but I wanted it
fast, you know, because I was just like, I'm so hungry.

30
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,280
And I literally woke up like, you know, I woke up 30 minutes
before the supposed stream time, which was 1 p.m.

31
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:13,560
So I was just like, um, uh, like I was just like, I need to
push it up the stream.

32
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,520
I'm too tired.

33
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,760
And I haven't even made the waiting room thumbnail at all.

34
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,660
Uh, because I told my thumbnail maker, I was like, you don't
have to make the thumbnail for the behind the scenes one.

35
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,680
I got it.

36
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,900
Don't girl, I got it.

37
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,920
I can do it myself.

38
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,300
And I was like, I don't got it right now.

39
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:38,840
and I want it fast so I was like okay this this hibachi
place is much closer than my go-to place which I've always

40
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:45,720
ordered when I was uh since my uh since I was a child um so
I was just like okay I'll try this place out and then I

41
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,700
should have had a okay there were several red flags

42
00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:04,020
but but the biggest red flag was they still they are um the
hibachi place sells chicken wings like the hot wings and i

43
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:12,840
was just like that's weird but i was like you know what i'm
craving some hot wings right now as well i might as well

44
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:20,980
order hot wings with my hibachi i was like i was like i i
should have known that was a red flag i was like that's

45
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:29,200
weird that they would have hot wings with hibachi um hibachi
is basically like you know this like the hot stove thing

46
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:37,500
they do um and then they do like those like cha cha cha cha
like those like sticks not sticks um those metal uh grill

47
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:44,380
things where they're they do hacha cha cha cha and then they
like do they do these like tricks on there with the rice and

48
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:57,260
be like i wish i just realized you can't see my hands i i
was doing the the spatulas those metal spatulas those metal

49
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:04,820
spatulas and then they like they two metal spatulas and then
they like toss and turn the food the the meats and the rice

50
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:13,640
and stuff yeah uh they cook on like a griddle in front of
you yeah that's hibachi and good there's place there's good

51
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:20,120
hibachis and then there's bad hibachis so i don't know what
benihana is i assume that oh i know that from solar

52
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:28,660
opposites benihana is like a famous hibachi place in america
um so that's it's basically Nihana um so yeah I ordered

53
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:37,000
hibachi I assume it was like the Asian more Asian like
hibachi then I I saw the red flag where they were selling

54
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,400
hot wings with hibachi and then I was just like I want hot
wings but usually the meat is teriyaki meat like it's

55
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:52,800
teriyaki sauce with with like you know chicken or beef or or
shrimp and stuff like that and so I was just like You know

56
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,100
what?

57
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,500
It's weird that they sell hot wings at this hibachi place,
but also I'm really craving some hot wings right now.

58
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,640
So, it's not just like, oh, fuck it.

59
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,040
Let's go.

60
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,940
Let's try this out.

61
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,680
But they definitely slacked on a teriyaki sauce.

62
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,720
I can barely taste any teriyaki sauce on my hibachi.

63
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,360
Because usually in hibachi, they like drench it with like
teriyaki sauce.

64
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,320
They called it yum.

65
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,560
What the fuck is yum yum sauce, by the way?

66
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,400
They're like, it comes with teriyaki sauce and yum yum.

67
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:22,840
yum sauce.

68
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,200
I'm like, what the fuck is yum yum sauce?

69
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,580
I've never heard sauce called like that before.

70
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:39,880
Yeah, it must be like some westernized way, some western,
like it has to have like some Asian name and they just call

71
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,820
it yum yum sauce.

72
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,100
There must be an Asian name to this.

73
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,760
There's no way it's actually called yum yum sauce there's no
way

74
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:07,280
i'm so confused i was so confused anyway let me take more
bites of mine

75
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:20,680
take more bites than my food real quick but i will say the
stream would be more relaxed doesn't remember the last

76
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:29,400
stream today um because like you know last two the last
month of december was a lot so i'm gonna this stream will be

77
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,580
much more relaxed and chill right now it's very informal um
we are going to go behind the scenes but i do want to just

my god the first birthday of the year

83
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,860
give the super chat thank you thank you no it's actually
called yum yum sauce it's an asian fusion thing with nor in

84
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:32,160
north america it's basically burger sauce with site spices
to better complement asian food what the this is the first

85
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:39,640
time i've ever heard of yum yum sauce i i like the other
hibachi place that i always go to never had yum yum sauce so

86
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:49,060
i am so confused that's a real thing That's a fucking real
thing.

87
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,720
I assume it was like an Asian sauce that they just like
Americanized.

88
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,960
That burger sauce with like, what?

89
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,020
All right, no.

90
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,380
Okay, so that's my second red flag.

91
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,900
If I see yum yum sauce, I...

92
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,520
If I see yum yum sauce, I most likely will not order from
that place.

93
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,700
I just, I don't know.

94
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,220
It's just, I don't want burger sauce on my fucking rice, I
guess.

95
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,000
It's just weird.

96
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:31,320
I don't want burger sauce when I'm eating rice Burger sauce
is supposed to be on burgers But it's so good I can barely

97
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:40,160
taste anything on this I can barely taste like any sauce on
this Boom It's mayo, ketchup, garlic, and a couple other

98
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:57,620
things Mmm Oh yeah Oh, yeah, the reason why I had to loop is
because as I was about to get ready, I got a text from my

99
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,440
landlord and I was like, remember to pay rent.

100
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,480
Because it's January 1st.

101
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,460
And I was like, oh, shit, okay.

102
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,380
That's why we were looping because I was trying to pay rent.

103
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,980
It was like, you still haven't paid January for, uh, put
your rent for in January 1st.

104
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,180
And I was just like, oh, fuck, okay, let me go.

105
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,440
Happy New Year.

106
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,620
And I was like, oh, fuck, let me go pay rent.

107
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,300
I want to get like, I want to make him angry because he's a
really good landlord.

108
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,380
Like, you know how he's a really good landlord?

109
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,900
He doesn't text me unless it's for rent.

110
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,080
That's why he's like, he's like, literally he doesn't ask
for anything.

111
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:46,500
He's just like, he only texts me if I, if I like, if I
forget to like, pay rent a day.

112
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:53,540
like my debt my rent payment is literally the first day of
every month but um usually he just wants to make sure that

113
00:16:53,540 --> 00:17:00,140
he's gonna get it on the first day so if I don't I usually
schedule it um because like uh you know it's just more

114
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:07,360
convenient I just schedule my rent um the date like the day
before I just schedule it and obviously yes the day before I

115
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,580
was so busy with New Year's stuff I forgot to schedule my
rent payment so it goes automatically on the first like on

116
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:24,760
the first the next day uh midnight midnight hit and i didn't
get it so um so grandma pay rent and i was like oh shit okay

117
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:37,200
let me go manually send the rent money right now no no i
can't send a reoccurring i fucking hate my bank i

118
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,570
can't i tried i tried and i can't

119
00:17:54,090 --> 00:18:00,590
Do I have to, I literally have to manually, I have to
manually pay my rent.

120
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,250
And I always have to remind myself.

121
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:05,950
Yeah.

122
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,170
Yeah, new year, new bank, exactly.

123
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:13,910
But yeah.

124
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,270
He's a really good landlord, though.

125
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,530
He doesn't...

126
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:30,030
he doesn't bother me at all he just literally was like only
talks to me when he needs money when he needs money

127
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:41,050
so the only time he talks to me and that's how i like it
don't need to do any small talk

128
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,720
what a cool guy

129
00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:03,290
oh yeah okay okay let's ooh okay i gotta try some i haven't
had ranch with my wings a long time all right let me try

130
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:13,330
these hot wings oh let me try these hot wings let's see how
hot these wings are i'm pretty sure it's not that

131
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:40,340
hot guys so there was like a listing of like how hot you
want your wings and it's like mild medium Obviously, I

132
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,580
picked the hot version.

133
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,300
It's not that hot.

134
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,140
I mean, it has a kick to it.

135
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,640
I think me eating so much Bulldog Junos over the years has
fucked up my spice tolerance.

136
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,720
It's not that hot, though.

137
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,040
That's a small kick.

138
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,560
It has a kick.

139
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,400
Not a small kick.

140
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,400
It has a kick to it.

141
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,740
But, like, my tongue's okay.

142
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,240
It's, like, not that hot.

143
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,700
I feel... I think this would be medium.

144
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,800
I think this would be a medium.

145
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,550
I mean, when I did the, what is it called?

146
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,230
The Hot Wings Sauce Test?

147
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,710
The Hot Ones Test?

148
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,650
Like, their hottest sauce was alright.

149
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,870
Like, I mean, their hottest, hottest sauce, I was like,
yeah, no, that's spicy.

150
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,370
But, like, the other ones, before then, I was like, no,
that's alright.

151
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,490
Like, it's not that bad.

152
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,910
I don't understand, like, when you see them start crying and
stuff, I'm like, it's not.

153
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,370
I personally, I didn't think, like, it's, like, crying
material.

154
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,020
Because I had some crazy hot sauces before.

155
00:20:59,300 --> 00:20:59,740
But,

156
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,730
yeah, the last, that's what I was saying.

157
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,750
The last dab was, like, the hottest one.

158
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,110
I was like, yeah, the hottest hottest one was hot.

159
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,350
Was a hot sauce.

160
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,190
There's one that literally tasted like fucking metal.

161
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,350
I was like, it's not even good hot sauce.

162
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:24,850
Like, the thing is, like, in Chinese cuisine, we literally
eat dishes just drenched with chili oil.

163
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,130
Like, my favorite, the mapwatering chicken.

164
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:36,890
like that's my favorite that's my favorite um chinese dish
and it's literally chicken just drenched in chili oil and

165
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:45,550
it's so fucking good yeah no there is a hot sauce and the
hot ones that literally just tasted like i'm fucking

166
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:50,430
drinking metal it doesn't even taste good

167
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,470
that's i fucking love chili oil

168
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:07,890
bomb?

169
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,390
Yeah, fuck that hot sauce.

170
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,170
That's not even good hot sauce.

171
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,240
It doesn't make it taste good.

172
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,860
Like, at least, like, make it taste like something.

173
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,580
I don't even remember if it's hot.

174
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,480
I just remember it tasted like shit.

175
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:32,880
Okay.

176
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:38,320
Well, before we begin, I'll show you guys the 3D model
stuff.

177
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:51,620
Alright, let me grab uh let me show you guys I'll grab I
didn't prepare I didn't like prepare a lot I didn't prepare

180
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:18,620

PowerPoint of the behind-the-scenes stuff and all the

181
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,580
work-in-progresses and the concept art.

00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,500
There's a lot.

183
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,640
There's a lot of slides.

184
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:32,440
But for the other stuff, outside of Doki Land, I didn't grab
any of the concept art, the behind-the-scenes, the

185
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,900
work-in-progress shots of everything.

186
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,100
I'm just going to go straight to it.

187
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,620
Like I said, first stream of the year.

188
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:52,840
I'm um relax hangout time we're just chilling it's been we
we just survived the summer and I'm just gonna chill right

189
00:23:52,840 --> 00:24:06,080
now so bam uh here's shout out to the artist uh katsune I
think it's katsumi let me grab the artist real quick so you

190
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:19,820
guys know I'm gonna have the credits real quick no I know I

191
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,720
I know I saved the credits I didn't save

192
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:49,460
it I so yeah I have it here um so let me just show the all
right so the wonderful people that worked on the 3d sub uh

193
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:59,960
katasumi was the concept artist so she uh he basically did
the um the i guess the three view of what the model is gonna

194
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:08,760
look like and then ryu and rika did the 3d design so we they
split in half so i think uh ryu made my 3d model but i don't

195
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,480
remember who made which were the other girls because my
point of contact was Ryu.

196
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:21,960
So I know Ryu made mine because he made the one before as
well.

197
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,940
So mine was the first one.

198
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,860
So he made mine first.

199
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,580
So they split the work in half with Rika as well.

200
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,200
So this one is my model.

201
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,520
This one's mine.

202
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,480
Oh, I'll show you what it looks like in 3D.

203
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,320
Translated in 3D.

204
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,420
It's so cute.

205
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,680
Let me grab it real quick.

206
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,420
It's actually, it looks so good.

207
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,960
Like, it actually, it's like one to one to the 2D
illustration.

208
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,420
We haven't listened to this in a while.

209
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:58,540
Alright.

210
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,240
Whoops.

211
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,570
Alright, it's almost one to one to the 2D illustration.

212
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,710
It looks so good.

213
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,050
It really does look really good.

214
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,010
Yeah.

215
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,520
That's what it looks like.

216
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:42,500
I will say, we did hit like a week before, a week before the
the debut of Jokulon.

217
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:50,900
This is not what it looked like before because I changed the
entire face of the previous model.

218
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,700
I wanted it to show on stream, but I forgot to because, you
know, a lot of other stuff was going on.

219
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:08,520
but the face originally did not look like that um i wanted i
realized when when they finished everything at the same when

220
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:16,500
everything was done and they were showing me all the all the
models together with all the other sloppy sisters mine

221
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:25,060
looked so different compared to everyone else because mine
was the first one and as they kept making it um the design

222
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:30,420
you can tell you sort of tell you can tell from here and the
reference sheet it's also like because they were following

223
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:41,300
the reference sheet so because the artists made mine first
um they focused more on the uh they focused more on the um

224
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:51,580
on i guess like matching my uh my skin suit design uh but i
was like oh i wanted to match the other girls more because

225
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:57,520
it looked so different in comparison put everyone out at the
same time.

226
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:05,980
So I was asked them if they could change the face to sort of
match the cohesive group of the sloppy sisters.

227
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,620
So I'll show you guys what I mean on what the face looked
like before.

228
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,180
So I could find the picture.

229
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,380
There it is.

230
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,680
Because I wanted to make it more soft.

231
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,120
I guess like cuter.

232
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,200
I wanted it to be cuter.

233
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:39,520
So you here it is so this was the face whoa whoopsie so this
was the face before and then you can tell like the eyes are

234
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:47,440
much more sharper and rectangular and i've thought like
compared to the other girls when we're all like put together

235
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:57,760
like side by side it just looked so off like i was just like
i still have i still have the model and also the shading of

236
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:04,820
the hair was different too because the other girls they had
a more the shading was more detailed in the back of the hair

237
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:10,020
so i was like asking if they could add that in as well
because i felt it i just looked like out of a bit out of

238
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:19,160
place um compared to the others so we had to like fix the um
we had to like fix the face last minute because i wanted all

239
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:29,580
of us to be more like a cohesive unit because like when we
were all put together side by side i stuck out so much like

240
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:38,760
it just it just looked like a little too off so I'm glad
that they were able to fix it I like the current face more

241
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:47,700
just because I think it's just cuter because it's supposed
to be like you know uh semi-cheby model can you get side by

242
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:56,400
side I mean this is the side by side the only difference is
literally the face guys like everything else is the same

243
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,960
like This is the side-by-side.

244
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,560
This is literally the side-by-side.

245
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,920
More side.

246
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,310
Oh, you mean like with the other girls?

247
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,810
Okay, I'll show you guys.

248
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:27,970
Let me see if I can actually, because I like grabbed all the
pictures together.

249
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,770
I was like, I don't know.

250
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,670
I'll show you guys what I meant.

251
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,050
I can screenshot it.

252
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:43,930
okay here you go um a snippet from our discord conversations

253
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,240
here do you have the insides

254
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:09,200
here so um don't mind the first one that was just me asking
for shading more shading on the hair as well so you can see

255
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:17,860
what i meant i was not like it just i've just felt like it
looked really off when we put all four of them together with

256
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:30,520
the older eyes so because of that i was like oh maybe we
should add like i wanted the eyes to be a bit more softer um

257
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:41,420
yeah so yeah but then the thing is everyone else sort of
matched together but then mine was like it just mine just

258
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:48,340
looked like always like just very different compared to
everyone yeah

259
00:31:53,160 --> 00:32:00,440
so that's why i asked them to like adjust the i also didn't
like how rectangular there's just something off about it and

260
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:12,640
i didn't like how rectangular the eyes were too um so the
four sister came out evil be careful of the four sloppy

261
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:28,560
sister fair but i'll show you like what it looks like
afterwards i think um let me see i didn't make a thing here

262
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,500
afterwards just to give me like a point of reference

263
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:49,210
but i do have it uploaded the the model with the sharper
eyes i do have it on file like in vr chat it's not like it's

264
00:32:49,210 --> 00:33:03,290
gone forever but I personally prefer the softer ones here I
think the softer one just looks a lot cuter in my opinion

265
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,470
and I like the edit for it

266
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,640
hmm and it only just matches everyone a lot better

267
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:38,640
hmm anyway let me grab the other letters references too what
is

268
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,200
I'm really happy to work with her again, though.

269
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,480
I keep seeing her when the artist is a guy, but I guess it's
just...

270
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,680
The artist is just so cute, so, like, how do you go with...

271
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,280
I don't know.

272
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,860
In my head, I'm just like, oh, my God.

273
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,440
And his icon is, like, a cute girl, too.

274
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,460
So, then, I'm, like, her.

275
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,540
I was accidentally using her, like, she and her.

276
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:14,040
Because the icon's a cute anime, girl.

277
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,260
Okay, and this is Mint's reference.

278
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,260
Oh my gosh, this is a big-ass fucking file.

279
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,040
I mean, resize it, guys.

280
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:29,820
Don't worry.

00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,620
This is her reference sheet.

284
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,520
It's so cute.

285
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,880
I love how everyone came up.

286
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,760
And, um...

287
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,300
This is Mint's reference.

288
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,500
Um, like I said, um, I paid for...

289
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,960
Everyone, I... Everyone's there, like, are you sure?

290
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,920
Everyone's like, are you sure, Doki?

291
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,820
And I was just like, no, just take it as, like, a Christmas
gift, you know?

292
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,540
Um, there...

293
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,340
I just figured, like, you know, a Christmas gift to the
Sloppy's.

294
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,200
Hmm.

295
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:10,580
Hmm.

296
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,240
Um.

297
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,840
Wait, that's her reference sheet.

298
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,500
That's not the LAMS reference sheet.

299
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,580
That's her.

300
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,740
That's her actual reference sheet.

301
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:26,820
Oops.

302
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,620
Alright.

303
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,740
And then there's Lamun's uh

304
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,210
there's Lamun's reference.

305
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,320
And then...

306
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,620
Where is Snuffy?

307
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,300
And then this is...

308
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,650
Yeah, they all came out really, really cute.

309
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,770
And this is Snuffy's reference sheet!

310
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,260
Yeah!

311
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:11,000
And we are getting all of these...

312
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:17,780
I guess like rigged for stream as well, like non-VR streams.

313
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,840
Because they have to have a special rigging done.

314
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,960
Like AR kit and stuff.

315
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,220
Those the girls are paying individually.

316
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,240
Because.

317
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,860
My Christmas gift for some models.

318
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,720
Not the rig.

319
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,760
Not the AR kit.

320
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,920
Because the AR kit is also very expensive.

321
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,640
So I was like.

322
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,880
If you guys want to use it.

323
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,460
Non-VR chat.

324
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:39,760
I'm sorry.

325
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,600
You guys have to pay for it yourself.

326
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,420
Yeah.

327
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:46,860
So.

328
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,620
Oh yeah.

329
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,700
Also the legs were.

330
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,000
Like this is what the legs are.

331
00:36:51,020 --> 00:37:00,160
on the artwork um so yeah but all the girls are paying for
them for the the non um how expensive is ar kit i just

332
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:13,100
remember it being expensive because like it takes a lot of
work too because it has to be matched the the face rigging

333
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,020
of your like the face movement and everything

334
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:29,040
so i was just like yeah i'm sorry girls you'll have to pay
for if you want to use this outside of VR chat, outside of,

335
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,660
I guess, like 3D.

336
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:37,160
I mean, technically, like, it's still 3D, but, you know, if
you want to use it, like, actually, like, streaming-wise,

337
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,380
outside of VR chat, you'll have to pay for the rigging for
that.

338
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:49,300
And you guys can see the legs are really skinny in the 2D
one, in the art references.

339
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,380
I had to ask the modelers to make their legs a little
thicker because I was like, yeah, it might be a little too

340
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:55,720
skinny.

341
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:06,500
I was like, so we actually, on the 3D models, we actually
like plumped the legs a little bit more, just a little bit

342
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:13,000
because I figured, I thought that, I don't know, I thought
it was just a little too skinny when I saw it in motion.

343
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:19,740
Um, when I saw it in motion and everything, um, here's
something fun that I can show you guys.

344
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,380
Let me download this video real quick.

345
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,340
known YouTube video.

346
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,080
Doing it all live.

347
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,900
Juge, they give us a super chat.

348
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,180
Thank you.

349
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:38,840
Thank you.

350
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,240
Halabra, they give us a super chat.

351
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:41,740
Thank you.

352
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,200
Thank you.

353
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,460
Doki, the sisters collab.

354
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,200
The sloppy sisters collab in Doki Lan was adorable.

355
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,740
It looked a lot like an elementary school field trip.

356
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,440
Yeah, like we're going to the Westworld.

357
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,540
Next, get someone with Miss Frizzle style model.

358
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,400
Here's set.

359
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:55,920
Thank you.

360
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,680
We're fucking heading the Westworld right now

361
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:11,200
What art is it called like there's like Reenactment places
that they they could take their kid like take the kids to

362
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,940
during school trips because there's like separate different
kinds I know there's one where it's like a reenactment of

363
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:26,680
like the uh The old days Frontier land is that what it's
called?

364
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,380
No, not LARPing.

365
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:36,200
Like, you know, like where you take the kids, the kids to,
like, school trips for, like, reenactments of, like, history

366
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:36,720
stuff.

367
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:44,280
Like, there's, like, the Wild West reenactments, and then
there's, like, ones where, because I remember in Canada,

368
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,700
they took me to one where it wasn't medieval.

369
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:54,120
Like, it was, like, like, the Gold Rush era in Canada.

370
00:39:54,120 --> 00:40:02,340
I don't remember what it's called and during that his like
what was the time frame around those around that when was

371
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:10,940
the gold rush like those mini villages the heritage oh is it
a heritage village I guess so I think that's what they're

372
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:26,960
called yeah but Dokilan is basically that it's basically
Westworld late yeah the early 1800s early 1900s The pioneer

373
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,580
villages.

374
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,420
Yeah, shit like that.

375
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,780
That's basically Doki Land.

376
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,840
The happiest place on earth.

377
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,260
Oh yeah.

378
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,040
Uh...

379
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,220
What is this file?

380
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,580
Oh, it's the...

381
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:42,940
Okay.

382
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,100
I'll show you guys a video.

383
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,760
I think there's no sound here.

384
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,220
Yeah.

385
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,820
There you go.

386
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,400
Here's Mint Dancing.

387
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,280
There's the 360 of me.

388
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:04,660
movement moving while we were testing the we were they were
testing how the models are moving

389
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:24,590
there she goes look her dance whoa there she fucking goes
guys whoa look at her move but yes that's how that's how I

390
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,310
guess like flexible they are

391
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,110
Anyway, there's me.

392
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,790
I need to download the video of me too.

393
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:36,850
Wait, is this the same?

394
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,390
Oh, wait, this is an old video.

395
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,890
I have to download a new video of it.

396
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:44,510
Look at that movement!

397
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,170
Truly new year movement right there.

398
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:56,880
Alright, let me grab the other files of the moving.

399
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,300
Oh yeah, you guys weren't able to see Lime was expressions
too.

400
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:02,940
I'll grab that.

401
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,540
badmose expressions as well.

402
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,220
This has to be the most unorganized behind the scenes, but
guys, you have to...

403
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,960
Please, I am...

404
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,580
But it's understandable why.

405
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,700
Why is this the most unorganized behind the scenes?

406
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,200
December was a lot for me.

407
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,580
It was a lot.

408
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,200
It has to be the most casual behind the scenes.

409
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,840
Do you play VR chat outside of stream?

410
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,380
Um, not really.

411
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,180
No, I don't.

412
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,540
I think it's just because VR is just too much stuff to put
on for VR.

413
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,780
It's very annoying.

414
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,520
Yeah, it's a chill stream.

415
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,780
Ah, but let me grab.

416
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,920
Here, here's Lamu's expressions that she wasn't able to show
you guys.

417
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:12,520
So, she has cried, shocked, annoyed dot eyes excited and
hard eyes those were her expressions that you guys weren't

418
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:33,700
able to see um let's see yeah what else oh yeah I wanted to
show you guys the I'll show you guys me moving but I don't

419
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:41,860
but let me find the video I'm gonna show that i'm moving too
because that's the first video i found that's the first

420
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:56,820
video that showed up so i will show that all right
downloading right now it's downloading i don't think i need

421
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:03,880
to show snuffy because she was so i think it's like she has
like a thousands of hours on vr chat so she knows how to be

422
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:15,940
like super expressive um in VR it's different motion capture
and VR is so different like movement wise because like in VR

423
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:25,060
everything is so much more clunkier because it's like you
know I have to hold on the controllers and also like the the

424
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:34,640
full body tracking is like they're like when when they're
very like I won't say fragile but when you're moving with

425
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,920
full body trackers because they're like to your waist.

426
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:43,160
They're strapped to your waist and your left and right foot,
like ankles.

427
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:49,220
And it's like, they're like these giant clunky triangular
things.

428
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:53,780
So when you're moving them, they like move around your body
too.

429
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:01,320
So it's like I have to always like adjust it because it's
like, it can like move like, it can like move out of

430
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,860
position and it's so annoying.

431
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:09,440
But when you're in like motion capture, it's like a lot
different I just realized it's like a lot different because

432
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:22,480
like I guess it's like since the suit is like a body suit
it's a body suit so you barely feel you barely like feel the

433
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,240
things on your body yeah I'm using vibe trackers

434
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:44,750
the thing is vibe trackers are much more uh accurate than
Moko B or body tracking.

435
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,090
You're doing like in-house 3D.

436
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,830
That's why they're so expensive.

437
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:05,030
Because vibe trackers are more expensive than than Mokapi.

438
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:12,110
Oh yeah, here is there's not moon dancing.

439
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:13,950
Okay, there you go.

440
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,480
Also, I realized I don't have the video of like the new face
so i have one of like the older face for mine

441
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:54,180
oh there she goes there she was and then there she goes now
this is mine

442
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:17,000
look at me girl look at that fucking movement i have no idea
what the fuck i'm dancing to i'm just i have no idea what

443
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
this dance She's ulting.

444
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,660
I definitely like the newer face.

445
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,300
I think the old face just feels off.

446
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,940
Well, I just look at the newer one now.

447
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,220
This is not a fortnight.

448
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,540
Technically, all dances are fortnight dances.

449
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:44,710
Oh my god, it's still going.

450
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,270
Everyone was so fast.

451
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,130
I'm pressing Q.

452
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:08,350
That's the average time span of a Luna ult, by the way.

453
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,570
Time to put on a show.

454
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,430
Is that really Luna's dancing?

455
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:26,850
What else?

456
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:28,530
What else I want to show you?

457
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:28,990
You know what?

458
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:32,470
I'll show you guys the world before I go to the behind the
scenes stuff.

459
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:33,450
I know it'd be fun.

460
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:36,090
Let me go to...

461
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:46,850
um i'm thinking of whether there's anything else i want to
show you guys from the 3d stuff i think that's it all right

462
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:58,050
let me show you guys the world i don't know i don't know the
game sound is gonna be really loud but we'll see we'll see

463
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:06,810
we'll show you guys don't get oh my god i almost went
straight to Rivals.

464
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:08,870
I was like, let's boot up.

465
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:11,430
And I hovered to Rivals.

466
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:14,130
I...

467
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:14,230

00:59:59,460 --> 00:59:59,940
Boom!

617
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:03,860

01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,920
But yeah, that is like one of the games.

622
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,880
Then we have our farmers here.

623
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,220
Welcome to tomato farm.

624
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,200
I raised those tomatoes from seeds.

625
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,880
I think you just walk in here with your grabby hands?

626
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,240

627
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,040

628
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:30,360
Also, you guys might have noticed, so it spawns in.

629
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,760
There's a chance for it to spawn in spawn in me.

630
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:36,160
So, look, see?

631
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:36,720

me in here, too.

635
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:48,640
So, you can pick them, and then maybe if you're lucky, you
can pick me.

01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:55,950
See, there's more.

01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:06,230
Don't come to my house or else I suck your...

641
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:06,830
Oh, blood.

642
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:08,210
I suck your blood.

643
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:08,610
See?

644
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:09,790
What a good dragon.

645
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:17,430
And there's the crying...

646
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:18,870
The crying...

647
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:20,150
I-boos now.

648
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,230
And then I love this one.

649
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,250
When you get close to the grave...

650
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:25,570
A little...

651
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:27,070
A goon comes out.

652
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:27,950
It's like, boo!

653
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:31,110
I caught you!

654
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:36,250
Here are all the other names.

655
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:45,370
There's Tomatori, Pug Snuffy, RestoTuber 2025.

656
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:50,230
Slash kill at all.

657
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:55,530
The suspects.

658
01:01:58,610 --> 01:01:59,010
Mockery.

659
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:06,970
Zendrea, Chibi-Doki, because this, I don't know if you guys
remember, but in the Bounty Hunter debut, I shot her.

660
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:10,450
This is where she lies.

661
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:12,030
This is like a throwback.

662
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:14,530
Rest in peace, lost the nap gadget.

663
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:15,630
Oh, you poor thing.

664
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:17,130
You fucking poor thing.

665
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:20,310
So that's why she's dead.

666
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:24,310
Don't tell her mom.

667
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:27,830
Oh, yeah, so for these coins.

668
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:31,270
You'll be able to collect them around the world.

669
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:33,730
There's seven to collect around the world.

670
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:36,730
So you'll be able to go around and collect those.

671
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:40,270
And then there's like little gotcha pawns.

672
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:41,450
You can use them though.

673
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:42,430
They're just for the split.

674
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:45,590
There's some cool gotcha pawns around here.

675
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,630
Yeah, there's collectibles.

676
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:50,670
I won't tell you where the others are though.

677
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:53,870
Oh, and then there's dad here.

678
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:58,850
Will you take this rose and be my next dog sitter?

679
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:01,230
A lovely rose for a...

680
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:04,450
A lovely rose for a lovely dragon.

681
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:07,030
It's our own little secret.

682
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:09,090
You and I...

683
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,190
I won't tell her what we did.

684
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,530
You get a little...

685
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:17,030
Achievement.

686
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:18,690
You get a little trophy.

687
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:20,250
Also, look at these cactuses.

688
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,050
Cacti.

689
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:22,530
It's shaped like you!

690
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:24,630
They're only shaped like you.

691
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:25,770
They're not actually you, guys.

692
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:27,330
We didn't turn you into cactuses.

693
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:28,430
Cacti's.

694
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:38,190
Don't worry, the misbehaving goons does not get turned into
cactuses.

695
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:41,590
Oh, and then there's a dunk tank.

696
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:43,150
Oh, I wish we did the dunk tank.

697
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:44,310
That would have been so fun.

698
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,350
Like I said, we had very limited time.

699
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:47,870
But there's a dunk tank right here.

700
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:49,650
You didn't dunk your fellow goons.

701
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:51,030
Oh, and there's more ads.

702
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:52,670
There's like fake ads around here, too.

703
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:57,770
There's some fun fake ads around here.

704
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:59,010
And graffiti as well.

705
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:01,070
where you guys can find all the graffiti.

706
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:03,410
There's also real ads.

707
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:05,110
See, there's like games here.

01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:14,300
Here, we can have actually played cards here.

710
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:17,040
So there's like a card game here.

01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,600
Actually, I have no idea what card game this is.

714
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:23,800
I didn't have a chance.

715
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,460

ZZ-Z-Z.

758
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:52,220

Yay.

761
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,820
There's a lot of stuff I didn't show you guys yet, but I
want you guys to explore it yourself.

762
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:02,360
Let's show some fun things.

763
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:04,200
Just try out and explore it yourself.

764
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:09,000
But yeah, unfortunately, this area was not finished.

765
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,340
This is an actual gameplay area.

766
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,460
So we can break in technically.

767
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:15,680
You guys can break in and explore it.

768
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:16,600
But that's all it is.

769
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:17,500
It's just exploring.

770
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,220
But there will be.

771
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,040
There will be like.

772
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:23,880
Okay.

773
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:25,180
I just realized what was down there.

774
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:25,760
But.

775
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,800
But there will be like an actual like shooting game that you
play.

776
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,120
That's based off of the.

777
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,400
That's based off of the.

778
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,760
My bounty hunter debut.

779
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,320
The battle royale game mode.

780
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:44,400
It's not going to be Battle Royale, but it'll be like a team
game.

781
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:48,680
You're now under construction.

782
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,960
This is Doki will change in the Battle Birds.

783
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:52,860
I realized that was a big mistake that we...

784
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,560
Okay, it'll be like at the bottom.

785
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,600
There'll be a sign at the bottom and be like, Battle Birds.

786
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,260
Because the logo is sick, though.

787
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:04,360
There's a sick-ass logo, so it'd be a shame to hide the
logo.

788
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:07,260
But we'll figure it out.

789
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:08,980
We'll figure it out.

790
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,700
Please do come back another day when it's all finished.

791
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:17,220
But no trespassing allowed.

792
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:18,220
I'm watching you.

793
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:19,020
Stick him out.

794
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:21,200
Yeah, we'll fix it in post.

795
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:29,380
Yeah, but here.

796
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:30,000
See?

797
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,940
There's a cover and everything.

798
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:32,780
Look.

799
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:34,100
You can tell.

800
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,620
You can tell that this is cover.

801
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,420
Oh yeah, it's sort of like...

802
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:40,380
Yeah, see this team.

803
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,020
Team Tomato.

804
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:48,470
Oh, they even super chat.

805
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:49,150
They can think.

806
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:53,290
Yeah, so it's like everything you saw in the...

807
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:55,310
In the...

808
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:56,690
A bounty hunter debut.

809
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:02,420
Yeah.

810
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,340
You encountered all of this.

811
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,520
Whoa, I'm burning alive!

812
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:08,380
Whoa!

813
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,380
And then the other team is...

814
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:13,080
What is the other team?

815
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:20,210
Where's the place where the dragon died?

816
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:22,350
I'll find it.

817
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:24,510
And team Kroki.

818
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:27,370
There's Team Tomato versus Team Kroki.

819
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:30,650
Look, and I was here.

820
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:31,730
Doki was here.

821
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:36,190
Is this extraction?

822
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:37,450
Is this Arc Raiders?

823
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:43,110
Yeah, it was around here.

824
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:45,670
This is where they died.

825
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:46,810
I remember it was like here.

826
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,410
It was like, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

827
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:50,090
It was around here.

828
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:54,010
Yay.

829
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:05,100
there's like graffiti scattered every how do i go back oh
it's over here i was like how do i how do i go back yeah

830
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:11,580
that sucks there's all the ads you saw in the debut

831
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:22,160
there and then you can climb back up here you technically
actually try to climb back by just using the ladder but it's

832
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:22,860
very hard

833
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:36,960
it's very hard i can't do it that's what they told me but i
i ain't bothering with that i'm just gonna click on it but

834
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:48,720
yeah looks amazing everyone worked so hard in this world i
can't wait to update it even more yeah you can technically

835
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:58,480
skyrim it and everything the easter eggs too like we we get
hopscotch too we there was a lot of concepts we had to cut

836
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:08,000
because look i have my own hollywood sign doke lawn you guys
like look at that happiest place on earth i even have my own

837
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:13,620
hollywood sign right there i was supposed to have my own
round rushmore too but we didn't have time i know i just

838
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:20,840
love wow so i'm so humble guys i land all about me

839
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:36,780
um but there was supposed to be a mount rushmore or a mount
dokeymore behind dokeylon uh but we did yeah mount dokeymore

840
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:48,980
with uh the four founding dokeys uh yeah there's i will say
my only criticism in this world is that there's just not

841
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:57,460
enough dokeys i just feel like we lack we lack Doki's in
Doki La.

842
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:08,580
So, the Mount Rushmore of YouTubers.

843
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,640
No, it's the Mount Doki more of YouTubers.

844
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,360
It's going to be Doki, Doki, Doki, and Doki.

845
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:23,240
So, that's going to be a future update as well.

846
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:27,860
The Doki Sweet.

847
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:32,620
I'm super excited for all of you guys to explore Doki now
and yourself.

848
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,280
When this world goes public.

849
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:35,720
When will this world go public?

850
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:36,600
I don't know.

851
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:44,160
To be honest, because we have to add, fix some things in
this world before we let you guys, before we push it for

852
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:44,800
public release.

853
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,100
There are a few things we'll add, fix a bit.

854
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:48,900
There's one thing.

855
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,940
I don't know if the project team is watching right now.

856
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,240
I was going to type it out to you guys.

857
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:56,180
But after the stream, I think it would be better.

858
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:57,960
Um.

859
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:00,120
So here it is.

860
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:00,880
This is our little.

861
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:02,400
Our night mode.

862
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:03,840
Um.

863
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:05,160
You see the sun come down here.

864
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,740
It's really cool.

865
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:08,200
You see that sun come down?

866
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,760
I think it would be cooler.

867
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,160
If we have more stars out.

868
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:13,300
Um.

869
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:14,720
To make it more like.

870
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:16,340
More aesthetically.

871
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:17,780
Like it's like the.

872
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:19,860
The wild west night sky.

873
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,820
I think it would be really cool.

874
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,920
If we can have more stars out for that.

875
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,360
And also like.

876
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:33,080
I guess like a more like lighter like yeah oh constellations
that would be so cute if we have constellations um yeah like

877
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:39,140
the desert sky I think it'll be cool I think after the
stream I realized it'd be we have a Merry Christmas one

878
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:44,520
because originally it was for Christmas and I was like no
let's push it for New Year's so we do have Merry Christmas

879
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:50,860
if you want to spend Christmas in Doki Lod it's just like
Disney it's just like Disneyland oh yeah one of the biggest

880
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,200
things I had

881
01:13:55,380 --> 01:14:04,020
huge change on the last month was that Dokilan was was first
no not the last month it was like two months ago we had to

882
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:18,120
where they um they were like everyone's panicking because I
was like why is it called Dokilan so um originally it was

883
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:29,700
called Dokilan because you know it was when um it was before
Some some bitch stole in Minecraft stole dokey land.

884
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,060
So I had to create dokey land

885
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:49,980
So it was before the incident so it was before the incident
so um somebody copyrighted dokey land in minecraft so I had

886
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:57,900
to pivot and then create dokey land so then I had to tell
the project 3d people I was like, we have to...

887
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,240
We have to adjust.

888
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,620
We have to adjust the name of this world.

889
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:05,080
It must be called Dokilan now.

890
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,380
Before the Minecraft incident.

891
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,780
So now we're officially called Dokilan.

892
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:18,790
Oh yeah.

893
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:22,910
Yeah, no crime was ever committed in Dokilan.

894
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:25,510
It's real now!

895
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:27,410
Dokilan is real!

896
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:36,510
Yeah, but when you're in this room, remember to tag your
screenshots with Doki-lon.

897
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:41,990
Yeah, the happiest place on earth.

898
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:50,530
I mean, there was never any witnesses.

899
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:51,670
What are you guys talking about?

900
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:53,390
Because I never committed any crime.

901
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:55,210
How can there be a crime?

902
01:15:56,430 --> 01:15:58,070
How can there be witnesses if there's no crime?

903
01:15:58,090 --> 01:16:07,710
crime guys how can there be witnesses if there was never any
crime

904
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:37,340
there's no war exactly there's never any war in dokyland

905
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,420
all right now

906
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:09,320
now that we finish looking at look at that I also got the
behind the scenes that the team drafted up for us compiled

907
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:15,020
for us all right let's me close this real quick

908
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:32,820
like I said this Doki Lan was the most hands-off I've been
for a VR project.

909
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:43,100
I gave it to the team, the project team, to come up with all
of the creative stuff side of Doki Lan, building it ground

910
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:43,740
up.

911
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:55,740
Because when I contacted everyone on this, my idea that I
gave, the idea proposed to them was that wanted like a wild

912
01:17:55,740 --> 01:18:05,500
west theme and i want i do want a saloon that's heavily
based off of the background that i use for um you know uh

913
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:12,920
for my chatting screen um so that was like the initial
concept that i proposed to them so i wanted to be called

914
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:21,080
doki land you know before the minecraft incident uh at first
it was called doki land

915
01:18:25,690 --> 01:18:35,190
needs a gold mat oh that's such a good idea we should get
the gold mat um harvesting the gold for a dokey land that's

916
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:49,710
where all your gold goes to uh um yeah and uh how did it
land online because someone else took dokey land i was

917
01:18:49,710 --> 01:19:00,370
trying to establish dokey land uh in minecraft but someone
took dokeyland so now we have dokeyland

918
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:14,710
the legally distinct dokeyland is like when someone filed a
trademark of the like it's like someone filed a trademark of

919
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:18,250
like disneyland so now you have to create disneyland

920
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:30,770
yet they started that fire oh we do need a campfire area i
don't know if any of my project team is taking notes right

921
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:40,950
now i like that campfire area gold mines we need the
dragoons to farm some gold for the duchess of dokylan yeah

922
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:54,210
the dokylan in our hearts so dokylan so you can see
originally um i had to change some things around so I came

923
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:57,810
in to the world, like, I think, like, four times.

924
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:03,350
I gave, like, notes four times for a project that's been
around for half a year.

925
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:05,350
Because, like, I said, I was very hands-off for this one.

926
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:08,530
I let the team do this work on...

927
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:09,630
At first, there was no deadline.

928
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:11,850
I was just, like, just work at your own pace.

929
01:20:11,990 --> 01:20:13,190
I want to create a...

930
01:20:13,190 --> 01:20:15,070
I didn't want to, like...

931
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:17,850
I was going to work at your own pace and just construct
something.

932
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:19,990
And then I figured out when to debut it.

933
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:22,630
But then I realized, as the months go by...

934
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:26,490
I was like, I want to release this for new years.

935
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:33,030
I thought it was like a perfect time to do a new year's
countdown reveal for this because, you know, I haven't had,

936
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:38,550
you know, I don't haven't had like a VR chat world yet for
Dokeybird.

937
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:43,130
So, and I always wanted to do like these little official
meet and greets too in VR as well.

938
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:46,830
So I figured, you know, two years, almost two years have
passed.

939
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:54,010
I think this is the perfect time to debut a VR chat world
for everyone to visit, hangout and everything.

940
01:20:54,710 --> 01:21:01,470
And VR chat is free, by the way, for those who don't know,
VR chat is free and you don't have to have VR to play in VR

941
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:01,770
chat.

942
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:04,150
So you can be on desktop mode, you can be on your PC.

943
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:07,150
I mean, I literally showed you guys Doki lot on PC.

944
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:13,490
So you don't need VR, you can also like play on your desktop
and everything.

945
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:15,370
Sadly, it's not on console.

946
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:16,470
That's the only downside.

947
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:30,130
It's to have a PC to be able to um to be able to boot up um
vr chat um but yeah so um huge childhood team like I said

948
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:39,270
during the last week and the last and yesterday um I gave
them a giant list of notes to change some things because

949
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:46,230
there are some things that like were like the final stretch
and they were able to like um they were able to like plow

950
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:54,830
through like majority of the notes that I gave So to make
the finalized version of Dokilan, so huge shout out to them

951
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:59,370
because like some of the things I asked for changes is like,
you can't see Dokilan very well.

952
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:03,870
Like the welcome sign and the Dokilan, like it's very hard
to see.

953
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:05,230
And then they changed all of that.

954
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:06,690
They made it more visible and everything.

955
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:09,930
So huge shout out to them for making some of these changes.

956
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:14,150
Here's them sketching.

957
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:19,210
Here's like concept art of them sketching out the world and
everything, like the layout

958
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:28,580
because I want it to be like a Wild West recreation, but
also like an amusement park and everything.

959
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:31,760
So here's the behind the scenes stuff.

960
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:34,980
Like I said, I was very hands off with this.

961
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,760
I gave them the initial concept idea.

962
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,700
And then like what I want.

963
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:45,520
I also wanted to include like the NPCs around like Dragon
NPCs and everything.

964
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:47,060
Like they're like cast members, you know?

965
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,580
Like the recreation cast members and everything.

966
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:51,060
Like we're at Disneyland type deal.

967
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,300
Or we're at Westworld.

968
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,820
Like those old, the Wild West recreation stuff.

969
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:03,820
And so I, like, they're them laying it out, the 3D
foundations of everything.

970
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,340
Some concept sketches, the statues.

971
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:09,860
So, you know, it's like the Walt Disney statue.

972
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:11,340
But it's me.

973
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:17,120
So, so, so the idea was for them.

974
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:17,800
I remember this.

975
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:21,120
I actually saw them, like, saw them, like, figuring this
out.

976
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:29,020
But it's basically like the Walt Disney statue where Walt
Disney is holding Mickey Mouse's hand.

977
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:32,200
That's like the front of the statue, like the front of the
amusement park.

978
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:33,380
And that's basically it.

979
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:34,740
So it's me.

980
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:41,180
And then more concept art of everything.

981
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:43,320
Doki bird.

982
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,760
Doki lawn.

983
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:45,860

985
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,440
Dokeland before the Minecraft incident.

986
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:03,240
Before the Minecraft incident.

987
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:06,460
It used to be called Dokeland.

988
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:12,440
So there's Mount Dokemore.

989
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,540
We might have to get rid of Dad.

990
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:15,620
He's not a Doke.

991
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:20,380
I'll think about it.

992
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:21,220
I'll think about it.

993
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:31,340
want to include dad in the um it's not mount dadmore it's
maybe we'll have like a smaller a smaller dadmore somewhere

01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:28,260
Oh, we'll do this.

1000
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:30,120

Dokelaan Town.

1003
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:40,560
So here's some of the props that were made.

1004
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:48,940
It's a little, look, it's a little rundown, but we just
don't have the budget to refurbish some of the place here,

1005
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:49,200
okay?

1006
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,280
Like, we're literally in the desert, guys.

1007
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:57,000
we're in the desert it's very hard to clean

1008
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:10,940
so here is um some of the stuff for like the benches the
tables and the chairs it's really cute like the little the

1009
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:18,340
little tablecloths and everything we should have since we
have several tables do you think we can add um other

1010
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:28,340
tablecloths to the other ones that be really cute we should
add like other tablecloths too and then here's the street

1011
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:38,140
lamp concepts right here it'll be cute and see who the
concept artist here as well don't worry i'll i'll paste the

1012
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:44,520
link of the behind the scenes powerpoint too um in the
description for those who want to look at it themselves

1013
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:54,120
slowly and then here's some uh photo op frames the original
concept bar they drew on paper oh my god so you can take

1014
01:26:54,120 --> 01:27:01,580
pictures like those like little photo ops that you see at
amusement parks and so there's like a little stands

1015
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:10,460
everywhere scattered around oh and then there's a okay i
gotta show you guys this okay so um remember how said like

1016
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:20,520
the original fireworks place we had we had like no picnic
area so they had to add that one in the last two days like

1017
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:31,000
the last two days before before stream day before d day um
they had to add a picnic area because we i tested out the

1018
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:40,260
fireworks concept i was like um guys we gotta fix this we
gotta either we have to remove the billboards or figure out

1019
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:49,720
a way to show the show the fireworks because when i play the
fireworks this is what i I see.

1020
01:27:54,090 --> 01:27:57,750
I'm fucking, it just felt too dystopian at that point.

1021
01:27:58,070 --> 01:27:59,830
It felt like I truly am in Disneyland.

1022
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:05,170
Like, it's like, what lovely fireworks.

1023
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:06,790
Anyway, bye, mama.

1024
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:18,190
So, that was like, when I, like, hop onto the world the last
two days, I was like, yeah, there was, like, ads everywhere.

1025
01:28:18,330 --> 01:28:19,110
Oh, shit, sorry.

1026
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:20,710
Sorry, you heard that.

1027
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:21,410
That was my...

1028
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:30,030
base station don't worry it's okay i actually knocked over
the base station that tracked my legs um so we had to we

1029
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:39,370
made the picnic area because of that and thank god we did
because that was definitely a better choice to have um so

1030
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:51,290
yeah here it's okay yeah so the yeah i just saw like my pc
case at the bottom i was like guys we gotta fix that like um

1031
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:53,630
I don't know if I like that.

1032
01:28:55,110 --> 01:28:56,550
What's another thing I want to show you guys?

1033
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:00,730
Oh, here.

1034
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:04,030
Let me save it.

1035
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:04,990
I didn't save this.

1036
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:08,190
Yeah, bye-bye, Mitch.

1037
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:13,470
So they moved the, thankfully, they moved the billboards to
another location.

1038
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:14,990
Oh, there's also hidden items.

1039
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:18,670
You might be able to find hidden items scattered around,
too, that I didn't show you guys.

1040
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:21,410
But there's some little hidden Easter eggs.

1041
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:34,790
too around the world oh and then here's like this is like
their idea because that we were like we gotta we gotta

1042
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:42,390
figure out a way uh to be able to watch the fireworks so the
project team in two days constructed the picnic area right

1043
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:50,790
here so shout out to them for like building an extra zone
last so last minute too uh but yeah here's all the

1044
01:29:50,790 --> 01:30:00,170
billboards you might be able to find around the world the
advertisements the subliminal messages um some of the custom

1045
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:11,890
billboards as well um that you'll see join the elite dragon
academy be the nerd you were meant to be dude what's right

1046
01:30:11,890 --> 01:30:25,270
yeah which dokey will you choose and then here is uh some of
the gravestone concepts that we have here the different

1047
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:38,830
designs of the dragon graveyard yeah 401 dokey coins what a
fucking steal right here and then uh we're debating i

1048
01:30:38,830 --> 01:30:48,570
remember they were debating on what to do like who's who's
the main grave and um the team uh the team voted on the

1049
01:30:48,570 --> 01:31:02,170
minecraft thing I mean, it was a good choice Rick, thank you

i said this world is like accumulation of my career as jokie

1066
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:10,900
bird so you know this is like a nice throwback to like all
the streams that we did all the little inside jokes the lore

1067
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:16,720
that we established uh throughout the years of streaming so
i figured you know it was really cute that they decided on

1068
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:27,120
you know the minecraft the minecraft pig as the as the
tombstone uh originally there wasn't actually a pop-up of

1069
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:32,760
the ghost it was really a ghost like the there was you saw
the right like the regular dragon there be like oh it's so

1070
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:42,180
sad please play blah blah blah blah soundtrack um yeah of
rubin um um but then i wanted to do like that little the

1071
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:50,680
little oh shit um the little like jump scare of a ghost
popping up and disappearing when you get closer i thought it

1072
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:56,820
was like a really cool idea just i think it was really cool
makes it more interesting interactive.

1073
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,120
Here is the tomato farm.

1074
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:04,700
Here is the tomato farm.

1075
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:08,380
The infamous farm that you all join the membership for.

1076
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:18,300
When you join the membership, you start, you have the
wonderful opportunity to work on the farm.

1077
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:19,220
That's right.

1078
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:23,340
You pay me to work on the tomato farm.

1079
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:35,960
so there it is and it's a great experience too you get to
see what it's like to work on the farm guys no this is not

1080
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:45,280
where you guys spot this is where i spot my army yeah
welcome to the tomato fields and here are all the other

1081
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:54,980
signs for the other different shops and locations located
around so there's the dps bank crocus emporium so originally

1082
01:36:54,980 --> 01:37:05,860
it was established they wrote it as established 2020 and
then um i was like when i saw that on the saloon i was like

1083
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:13,280
why is it 2020 like i didn't know the reference because they
picked the year um also you can tell that i like i also

1084
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:21,080
adjusted this i was like make this red and make this part
green because then it's like more And they're like, oh, we

1085
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:22,400
don't remember why.

1086
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:27,540
Because I was like, so why did you pick the year 2020?

1087
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:28,960
I'm like a bit confused.

1088
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:32,240
Like, I feel like, am I missing something about my own
career?

1089
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:37,060
And they're like, oh, we don't remember why we picked 2020.

1090
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:38,200
I was like, oh, it's a five.

1091
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:42,660
You can just pick the, you can pick like the year I debuted.

1092
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:47,120
And then a couple of days later, I came back.

1093
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:54,400
And I was like, guys, so why is it on 2023?

1094
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:57,480
And like, that's the year you came back.

1095
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,280
And I was like, guys, that's 2024.

1096
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:12,620
And I saw that on the day of the stream in the morning when
I went to do like the final sweep around the world.

1097
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:19,900
We're like, oh fuck, we're off by a year.

1098
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:34,780
So, yeah, so, I literally, yeah, I was like, it was like the
morning, it was like the morning of the 31st, and I was just

1099
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:42,100
like, guys, I don't, so, so, what, what year, what was the,
why is it 2023?

1100
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:51,660
So, we were able to fix that last minute, so now you see
2020.

1101
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,840
24 on the salute.

1102
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:59,640
All right, and then there's some more of the Dokilan
buildings.

1103
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:04,140
Like I said, for the future updates, we're going to make
them so that you can enter the buildings and stuff.

1104
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:07,720
We got to come up with the concept of how they should look
like them.

1105
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:09,920
That's like our next task.

1106
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:13,740
Man, here's like the rough design, Western and futuristic.

1107
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:19,000
Oh, it's like, oh yeah, their inspiration was Junkertown
from Overwatch.

1108
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:21,540
So, if you guys were like, oh, it just looks like
Junkertown.

1109
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:24,620
That's where they grabbed a lot of their inspiration from.

1110
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:29,340
But also, I asked them to, like, add a window.

1111
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:36,600
So for the jail on the side, I asked them to, like, add a
window so you could see one of the locked-up dragons just,

1112
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:39,060
like, on the bars, being, like, let me out.

1113
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:44,300
I want you to see the criminal.

1114
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:50,340
What else is there?

1115
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:50,600
Oh, yes.

1116
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:51,660
Here's some concept art.

1117
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,540
of what the jail should look like.

1118
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:56,380
And in the end, it's just him.

1119
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:58,120
I like the taped sunglasses.

1120
01:39:58,420 --> 01:39:59,420
Yeah, see that?

1121
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:04,480
The taped sunglasses on the Dragoon.

1122
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:05,860
We should make a Sheriff Goon.

1123
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,800
We should make that Sheriff Goon, too.

1124
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:09,900
Smart.

1125
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:13,880
And then here's the DPS.

1126
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:19,500
Here's the concept sketches of what the bank would look
like.

1127
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:22,080
savings.

1128
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:25,060
So this is from Allet.

1129
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:27,240
I'm super glad it made it through.

1130
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:29,080
Dragons will know the instant they see it.

1131
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:33,380
Joki always mentions how she loves to include us in things
and this was a way for me to really help with that.

1132
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:38,620
Thank you for being such an amazing community and I made you
proud.

1133
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:39,740
So this is from Allet.

1134
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:47,320
Concept art from Allet and then the 3D gear and then Wuka
doing the logo for DPS savings.

1135
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:49,980
And here is Shell Shock.

1136
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:57,220
Can't be a western town if there's no ammo for shooting we
try to include as many different dragon types as possible

1137
01:40:57,220 --> 01:41:11,700
and this one is for egg goons get it ha ha shell shock shell
egg how is he with his feet of course how is the egg he's

1138
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:20,760
using his foot to grip on the gun but here's all like all
the different types of um quick draw armory oh i wish we

1139
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:32,120
could have done the like you know walk there like with
snuffy and i did the i wish snuffy and i would did that

1140
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:41,360
where like we're like we did a western duel and we like walk
10 like turn around and walk 10 steps back and then draw but

1141
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:51,400
like i said we had no time it would have been fun if we were
able to get a showdown an old classic western showdown with

1142
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,120
guns yeah

1143
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:14,290
technically we can in the future also they made tumbleweeds
they're gonna add it in later and there's a croaky emporium

1144
01:42:14,290 --> 01:42:17,790
concept artist by outlet

1145
01:42:23,710 --> 01:42:31,190
and in other signs that didn't make the cut the welcome sign
went through a bit and I felt upright to be greeted by

1146
01:42:31,190 --> 01:42:31,510
everyone.

1147
01:42:31,670 --> 01:42:32,450
It wouldn't be a Doki world.

1148
01:42:32,630 --> 01:42:34,850
The truth start underneath all the skin soup.

1149
01:42:35,330 --> 01:42:36,790
Home sweet home in the tomato farm.

1150
01:42:37,210 --> 01:42:40,450
Lastly, we remembered the Doki Lawn incident of 2025.

1151
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:42,450
What Doki Lawn incident?

1152
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:44,030
I don't know what you're talking about.

1153
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:50,210
This graveyard has nothing to do with any incidents that
happened in Doki Lawn.

1154
01:42:50,630 --> 01:42:54,590
You signed, you clicked accept on the terms of conditions
guys.

1155
01:42:55,450 --> 01:42:57,090
Wait, did the graveyard his own sign?

1156
01:42:57,170 --> 01:42:57,830
I didn't even notice.

1157
01:42:57,970 --> 01:42:58,250
that.

1158
01:42:59,910 --> 01:43:00,780
Oh no, they're okay.

1159
01:43:02,770 --> 01:43:02,930
Whoa.

1160
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:04,990
Oh yeah.

1161
01:43:05,190 --> 01:43:08,750
So these are all the, yeah, what Dokilan incident?

1162
01:43:08,930 --> 01:43:12,490
I have no idea what any of them are talking about.

1163
01:43:15,490 --> 01:43:16,850
What incident?

1164
01:43:18,470 --> 01:43:23,670
Yeah, here's all the concept art of the graveyard, the farm,
and the welcome set.

1165
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:31,990
And then we have our water tower, because Because a western
town has to have a water tower to get the water.

1166
01:43:33,030 --> 01:43:33,830
So, yeah.

1167
01:43:34,010 --> 01:43:35,590
So the overall water supply.

1168
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:39,270
And we can see the different concept art of the water tower.

1169
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:40,390
Yay!

1170
01:43:41,170 --> 01:43:42,430
What the fuck is that?

1171
01:43:43,890 --> 01:43:45,810
What the fuck is this?

1172
01:43:46,150 --> 01:43:46,690
This top.

1173
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:50,090
I don't know.

1174
01:43:50,270 --> 01:43:52,070
I've never seen that sketch before.

1175
01:43:53,050 --> 01:43:55,710
No, what the fuck is this thing at the top?

1176
01:43:56,370 --> 01:43:57,230
This thing.

1177
01:43:59,350 --> 01:44:01,530
What an odd creature.

1178
01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:03,930
Man, there's the Doki Lan water tower.

1179
01:44:06,110 --> 01:44:08,710
And then here's the water tower logo.

1180
01:44:10,030 --> 01:44:10,750
Right here.

1181
01:44:11,490 --> 01:44:12,550
Yeah, you sell Doki Lan.

1182
01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:15,750
Yeah, they had to...

1183
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:16,510
Yeah, it was...

1184
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:21,150
I did like that this is originally Doki Lan.

1185
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:26,530
Before the Minecraft.

1186
01:44:28,610 --> 01:44:29,490
Minecraft situation.

1187
01:44:31,650 --> 01:44:32,910
Yeah, Doki Lime.

1188
01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:38,050
And then some windmill as well.

1189
01:44:38,150 --> 01:44:39,550
Oh yeah, there's a windmill here.

1190
01:44:40,110 --> 01:44:42,230
We almost had a beak fan that opened and closed.

1191
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:42,810
Maybe in the future.

1192
01:44:42,850 --> 01:44:43,730
I'll be so cool!

1193
01:44:43,890 --> 01:44:45,370
That'll be cool if we were able to add that.

1194
01:44:46,170 --> 01:44:47,690
I didn't know it'd be really immersive.

1195
01:44:47,870 --> 01:44:49,090
You guys can add it.

1196
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:52,450
But here is the windmill.

1197
01:44:53,570 --> 01:45:03,930
You can see it at the um You can see it at the, I think it
like near the graveyard of Doki Lan.

1198
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:06,670
And the game boosts.

1199
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:08,310
I like the gun idea.

1200
01:45:08,410 --> 01:45:09,210
That was really cool.

1201
01:45:09,410 --> 01:45:11,930
So here's the different concept designs of the gun.

1202
01:45:12,730 --> 01:45:14,770
Unfortunately, we were not able to play any of the games.

1203
01:45:14,970 --> 01:45:17,050
Like I said, we were on a very tight schedule.

1204
01:45:17,190 --> 01:45:18,750
We didn't want to miss the countdown.

1205
01:45:18,990 --> 01:45:20,990
I refuse to do my countdown.

1206
01:45:21,230 --> 01:45:23,350
The Shaw Goodman fucking room.

1207
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:24,110
I...

1208
01:45:29,210 --> 01:45:34,650
So, but I hope you guys are able to enjoy the games when the
world goes public.

1209
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:40,330
Like I said, the Sloppy Sisters are going to be doing an
official meet and greet in the Doki Lan world.

1210
01:45:40,950 --> 01:45:44,130
Dates and time will be announced later when we align our
schedules.

1211
01:45:44,290 --> 01:45:48,450
Because, you know, all four of us are like, you know, really
busy people, all four of us.

1212
01:45:49,890 --> 01:45:51,410
So, you know what's crazy?

1213
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:57,830
I did not get a DMCA on the Saul Goodman fucking...

1214
01:45:57,850 --> 01:46:11,410
worlds but i got dmca because the the the plane world had
top gun music in there so so i can't so the so unfortunately

1215
01:46:11,410 --> 01:46:20,070
the video is unmonetizable because of it because of the
fucking top gun slash europe yeah i got a fucking dmca from

1216
01:46:20,070 --> 01:46:24,850
that but the song goodman world was fine it was fine

1217
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:41,960
Yeah, so these are like, there's the dunk the dunk tank, the
whack-a-bullet, and also the little, like, you know those,

1218
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:48,560
like, clown ones where you shoot, like, water into the
clown, and then whoever shoots the most water in it wins.

1219
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:52,300
For this one, the more you shoot water in it, the more the
neck grows.

1220
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:58,620
So here's all the game boosts and everything.

1221
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:05,980
yeah it does it actually goes up the more water you shoot
yeah the balloon race the more water you shoot into the doki

1222
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:20,680
the longer the neck grows and then here's the all the
there's black moon dragon moon duncan and bang bang how long

1223
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:29,580
does it get well you gotta play play to fight oh and this is
based off of my water gun from my um from my summer debut My

1224
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:30,500
summer outfit.

1225
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:31,820
My summer is skin suit.

1226
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:35,100
So this is the water gun design from it.

1227
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:38,040
And then there's hit, hit, bang, bang.

1228
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:43,160
Yeah, and then there's some of the dragon NPCs.

1229
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:48,620
The drunk one I asked them to add it during one of my
feedback sessions.

1230
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:51,480
I was like, we must have a drunk dragon.

1231
01:47:51,820 --> 01:47:52,240
No, sorry.

1232
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:57,480
A very sober dragon in front of the saloon.

1233
01:47:57,620 --> 01:47:58,640
So I'm glad they added that.

1234
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:06,200
nice it was a nice touch it makes the world more real you
know it makes the world feel more real and more like i felt

1235
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:15,380
wanted to feel like a small town like a natural like you

Thank you for the Akka Super but it really beats a lot.

1282
01:54:54,530 --> 01:54:58,430
This is why you should keep tissues fired.

1283
01:54:58,890 --> 01:54:59,530
I did!

1284
01:55:00,050 --> 01:55:04,110
I forgot I went and wiped it as fast as possible.

1285
01:55:04,810 --> 01:55:09,430
I don't know how long it sat marinating my fucking mouse
pad, right?

1286
01:55:09,850 --> 01:55:11,050
Thank you for the super chat.

1287
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:11,590
Thank you, thank you.

1288
01:55:11,710 --> 01:55:16,930
I literally looked down and I noticed a pool of wrench on my
fucking mouse pad.

1289
01:55:18,330 --> 01:55:26,390
Anyway, are some dragoons, some NPCs, so they're...

1290
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:27,390
Oh, we should wait.

1291
01:55:28,010 --> 01:55:29,470
We don't have... Wait, wait.

1292
01:55:29,570 --> 01:55:30,350
Can we add?

1293
01:55:30,830 --> 01:55:32,670
Can we add the egg waders?

1294
01:55:33,310 --> 01:55:34,350
That's so cute.

1295
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:35,590
I just noticed that.

1296
01:55:35,610 --> 01:55:37,590
I want to add the egg waders there.

1297
01:55:38,150 --> 01:55:39,490
Can we add that later?

1298
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:40,410
No, I know.

1299
01:55:40,590 --> 01:55:41,870
I didn't miss it, guys.

1300
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:42,250
I did.

1301
01:55:42,310 --> 01:55:42,990
I know what.

1302
01:55:46,790 --> 01:55:48,610
I am not enabling

1303
01:55:52,810 --> 01:55:55,670
I'm Lolly, thank you for the super chat.

1304
01:55:55,950 --> 01:55:56,250
Thank you.

1305
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:58,030
She's so cute.

1306
01:55:58,670 --> 01:56:02,590
Did you play more Dynasty Warriors relationship cutscenes?

1307
01:56:02,930 --> 01:56:04,070
I think in the super chat, thank you.

1308
01:56:04,510 --> 01:56:05,230
Thank you.

1309
01:56:05,230 --> 01:56:10,110
Thank you, I like a bunch of the other other NPC concept
art.

1310
01:56:10,830 --> 01:56:12,210
Wait, we did have them!

1311
01:56:12,590 --> 01:56:14,210
Wait, we do have them!

1312
01:56:14,350 --> 01:56:16,390
Wait, where's the waiter egg going?

1313
01:56:16,510 --> 01:56:17,730
We should add them in.

1314
01:56:20,730 --> 01:56:29,890
let's add the waiter it's so cute we actually have the 3d
models of it I didn't know they were not in the saloon I

1315
01:56:29,890 --> 01:56:41,590

1316

Thank you.

1320
01:56:52,670 --> 01:56:54,510
I really appreciate it, guys.

1321
01:56:54,770 --> 01:56:56,490
Thank you so much.

1322
01:56:57,850 --> 01:56:59,490
And then here's the stage.

1323
01:57:00,170 --> 01:57:02,410
Like I said, you guys can watch my streams, you know?

1324
01:57:02,570 --> 01:57:03,810
We do a little watch party.

1325
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:09,830
When we're doing, like, watch alarms or stuff or watch
parties, you guys will be able to do, like, a watch party in

1326
01:57:09,830 --> 01:57:12,150
the VI chat world with all the other dragons and stuff.

1327
01:57:12,170 --> 01:57:13,110
It'll be so fun.

1328
01:57:13,250 --> 01:57:17,090
That's why I always say, like, whenever we make worlds, I
like to have, like, a TV there.

1329
01:57:17,190 --> 01:57:18,390
Like, TV in all the worlds.

1330
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:19,690
Like, a stage or a TV.

1331
01:57:20,390 --> 01:57:27,370
like for all the dragoons that hang out together we're doing
a hangout party or session and we're not you're not using my

1332
01:57:27,370 --> 01:57:39,270
world to watch saw goodman that is my only rule all right
project team if you are watching put a sign um i would like

1333
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:52,090
a sign there that says saw goodman is ban it banned from
this premises i feel like if you see this man Do not let him

1334
01:57:52,090 --> 01:57:52,750
in.

1335
01:57:52,910 --> 01:58:04,950
Like, I would like to have a sign where it's just to face a
Saul Goodman and then you cross him out.

1336
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:06,570
Yeah, that's good.

1337
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:07,230
That's good.

1338
01:58:07,390 --> 01:58:11,070
It's like, he is bad.

1339
01:58:12,830 --> 01:58:15,610
Yeah, a wanted sign for Saul Goodman.

1340
01:58:15,850 --> 01:58:19,250
And if it's a wanted sign, it'd be like dead, not alive.

1341
01:58:21,330 --> 01:58:34,090
like what a dead no lawyers are allowed on this premise here
you go and then there's the stages the concept art for the

1342
01:58:34,090 --> 01:58:43,050
stages how i end up yeah so originally there was this art
there on the side and i said please move it i was just like

1343
01:58:43,050 --> 01:58:52,590
um i do not feel comfortable having buba blobfish on the
side of the stage Please move him somewhere else.

1344
01:58:52,890 --> 01:58:56,030
So we moved the blobfish somewhere else.

1345
01:58:57,530 --> 01:58:57,990
Bonus point.

1346
01:58:58,210 --> 01:59:01,670
If it saw Goodman, fan art cross.com.

1347
01:59:01,830 --> 01:59:02,890
Thank you for the super chat.

1348
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:03,210
Thank you.

1349
01:59:03,550 --> 01:59:04,170
Thank you.

1350
01:59:04,230 --> 01:59:11,150
And we're more on the concept art and the 3D of the stage
itself.

1351
01:59:12,290 --> 01:59:13,050
And then the saloon.

1352
01:59:13,270 --> 01:59:14,570
Here's the saloon.

1353
01:59:15,350 --> 01:59:15,990
Exterior.

1354
01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:17,930
Like I said, that was a mandatory thing.

1355
01:59:18,010 --> 01:59:22,910
I was like, If anything, I dip, I, the mad, sorry.

1356
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:30,470
I need the saloon in this world.

1357
01:59:31,090 --> 01:59:33,250
That was the one thing I needed in the world.

1358
01:59:35,650 --> 01:59:37,070
Rayblade, thank you for the super chat.

1359
01:59:37,130 --> 01:59:39,750
Do you think that's the most in-character thing you've ever
said?

1360
01:59:39,970 --> 01:59:42,810
There's red jump on my gamer mouse pad.

1361
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:47,170
Usually, I've been trying to avoid eating at my desk.

1362
01:59:47,670 --> 01:59:51,550
So, like, of course, I get punished because I was like, Oh,
fuck, I have a stream.

1363
01:59:51,710 --> 01:59:52,730
I have a stream soon.

1364
01:59:52,850 --> 01:59:53,490
I gotta go.

1365
01:59:54,010 --> 01:59:55,290
I gotta eat at my desk.

1366
01:59:55,790 --> 01:59:59,310
Here's the more of the concept art of the saloon and
everything.

1367
02:00:00,370 --> 02:00:02,910
And then here is the logo for it.

1368
02:00:03,890 --> 02:00:05,550
The Dragoon Saloon.

1369
02:00:06,850 --> 02:00:07,290
Except...

1370
02:00:07,290 --> 02:00:09,510
Yeah, 2020, 2023.

1371
02:00:09,950 --> 02:00:12,070
I like it's like the correct one.

1372
02:00:20,770 --> 02:00:23,350
Guys, third time's the try, you know?

1373
02:00:23,910 --> 02:00:25,330
Third time's the one.

1374
02:00:29,530 --> 02:00:33,910
In case you forget, this is the correct one.

1375
02:00:34,330 --> 02:00:35,850
In the end, it's okay.

1376
02:00:36,230 --> 02:00:37,790
Three times the charm.

1377
02:00:37,950 --> 02:00:39,070
Three times the charm.

1378
02:00:42,070 --> 02:00:44,270
Yeah, so here's the logo for it as well.

1379
02:00:46,190 --> 02:00:46,830
Ragoon Saloon.

1380
02:00:48,370 --> 02:00:49,510
The numbers, what do they mean?

1381
02:00:49,550 --> 02:00:50,150
That was me!

1382
02:00:50,270 --> 02:00:51,870
I was like, what did the numbers be?

1383
02:00:51,990 --> 02:00:52,890
I was like, why is it?

1384
02:00:53,110 --> 02:00:53,990
I was like, I'm confused.

1385
02:00:54,110 --> 02:00:57,830
Why did we pick 2020, 2020, and 2023?

1386
02:00:58,110 --> 02:00:59,630
And in the interior of the saloon.

1387
02:00:59,970 --> 02:01:02,970
I think it's really cool that when you can, like, go into
the building too.

1388
02:01:06,150 --> 02:01:07,570
So here are some of the food.

1389
02:01:07,850 --> 02:01:09,530
They weren't able to make all the food.

1390
02:01:10,010 --> 02:01:12,050
I would love to have you guys made the bento box as well.

1391
02:01:12,070 --> 02:01:13,290
well for the future update.

1392
02:01:14,030 --> 02:01:15,570
I think the bar looks amazing.

1393
02:01:15,770 --> 02:01:18,890
The design of the bar, it looks so good.

1394
02:01:21,230 --> 02:01:23,690
Yeah, so here's like the bar and everything.

1395
02:01:24,830 --> 02:01:27,450
The little jukebox, the saloon jukebox.

1396
02:01:27,990 --> 02:01:29,450
Here's like all the design.

1397
02:01:29,590 --> 02:01:30,690
So yeah, it looks like Do Kitty.

1398
02:01:31,770 --> 02:01:36,010
The jukebox was based off of Do Kitty and everything.

1399
02:01:37,070 --> 02:01:39,530
Like I said, it's very personalized, like everything.

1400
02:01:40,570 --> 02:01:53,210
And then here are all the drinks and stuff, the bar bottles,
the dragon shine, 45% alcohol, busting, and doking beer from

1401
02:01:53,210 --> 02:01:54,050
my background.

1402
02:01:54,510 --> 02:01:57,770
I was like, we have to have doking beer since 2024.

1403
02:01:57,930 --> 02:01:59,430
Like, that one was right.

1404
02:01:59,510 --> 02:02:03,190
Wait, wait, guys, guys, okay.

1405
02:02:03,750 --> 02:02:08,150
So, wait, project team.

1406
02:02:08,610 --> 02:02:11,990
So, like, how did we get that 2024 correct?

1407
02:02:12,070 --> 02:02:14,070
on the Toe King beer.

1408
02:02:22,050 --> 02:02:27,030
Look, at least we got the 2024 on the Toe King beer.

1409
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:29,670
At least we got that one correct.

1410
02:02:33,110 --> 02:02:35,250
Beer was more important.

1411
02:02:36,930 --> 02:02:38,190
No, this was before.

1412
02:02:38,570 --> 02:02:43,350
I corrected the 2024, like, the day of the stream.

1413
02:02:45,630 --> 02:02:48,210
It was like literally the day of the stream.

1414
02:02:48,970 --> 02:02:49,830
Oh, and then there's furniture.

1415
02:02:49,990 --> 02:02:51,810
We love furniture here.

1416
02:02:52,450 --> 02:02:54,810
We're not good with years, bro.

1417
02:02:57,610 --> 02:03:01,290
It's always a bureau clock somewhere in the world.

1418
02:03:03,330 --> 02:03:05,870
Like, oh my god, look at this chair, though!

1419
02:03:06,670 --> 02:03:08,210
And the table!

1420
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:10,290
Oh my god!

1421
02:03:12,070 --> 02:03:13,390
table right there.

1422
02:03:13,630 --> 02:03:14,850
That's a sexy table.

1423
02:03:15,370 --> 02:03:18,330
Look at those polygons and those textures.

1424
02:03:19,310 --> 02:03:19,690
Wow.

1425
02:03:20,830 --> 02:03:20,830
Beautiful.

1426
02:03:23,570 --> 02:03:26,370
And then here is the wall mount.

1427
02:03:26,670 --> 02:03:33,570
I want you guys to know those are, this is an ass by the
way, in case you're wondering, those, that's the butt, okay?

1428
02:03:35,230 --> 02:03:38,230
It's, it says juicy, okay?

1429
02:03:38,450 --> 02:03:38,850
That's,

1430
02:03:42,070 --> 02:03:42,350
else.

1431
02:03:42,950 --> 02:03:44,010
It's the ass.

1432
02:03:46,570 --> 02:03:50,690
It's the buttocks and nothing else.

1433
02:03:52,690 --> 02:03:56,270
Yeah, the 3DT made this from scratch.

1434
02:03:56,850 --> 02:03:58,750
They're dragon cheeks.

1435
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:10,190
But yes, this is a dragon that did not pay his taxes.

1436
02:04:10,670 --> 02:04:11,750
So remember dragons.

1437
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:14,410
To pay the doki tax and the dragoon.

1438
02:04:14,490 --> 02:04:15,970
There's several taxes you gotta pay.

1439
02:04:16,370 --> 02:04:21,730
So you know how there's like sales tax and like your GST and
your other T's.

1440
02:04:21,910 --> 02:04:24,370
So there's the dragoon tax and your doki tax.

1441
02:04:24,570 --> 02:04:28,270
So remember to pay those taxes or you're going to end up
like this guy.

1442
02:04:28,330 --> 02:04:30,150
We're going to get both your backs too.

1443
02:04:30,210 --> 02:04:31,550
We're going to get the front and the back.

1444
02:04:33,730 --> 02:04:36,930
We can't waste good body parts.

1445
02:04:40,030 --> 02:04:40,530
But stop.

1446
02:04:40,730 --> 02:04:41,490
Thank you for the super chat.

1447
02:04:42,070 --> 02:04:42,650
Thank you.

1448
02:04:42,790 --> 02:04:45,450
The chongers' nesticles are how good to see.

1449
02:04:45,570 --> 02:04:47,650
We have that reference there.

1450
02:04:48,050 --> 02:04:50,090
And here's the food design.

1451
02:04:51,890 --> 02:04:54,110
Um, I don't know why you guys keep...

1452
02:04:58,650 --> 02:05:08,170
There's the rice maker, the rice cooker, um, there's some
doki-la and sandwiches, and the doki burger.

1453
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:09,610
It's just like Disneyland.

1454
02:05:09,850 --> 02:05:11,150
We should have churros.

1455
02:05:12,490 --> 02:05:14,550
Project team, we should have Churros.

1456
02:05:14,870 --> 02:05:17,710
It'll be the true, it'll be just like Disneyland.

1457
02:05:18,270 --> 02:05:20,710
And then like, if we, we should have a Churros stand.

We need to have a Churros stand and the Churros must cost

1460
02:05:26,490 --> 02:05:28,390
There should be a sign and be like $10.

decorations.

1470
02:06:19,990 --> 02:06:23,810
Oh, yeah, you guys can see the playing cards were also
customized and everything.

1471
02:06:24,030 --> 02:06:30,370
So you can see the little, all the cute little trinkets
around and everything.

1472
02:06:30,510 --> 02:06:39,870
I really like the little sloppy hats to, as, like, a little,

Yeah, you can smoke inside, outside, as long as you're in
Doki-lon.

1484
02:07:57,610 --> 02:07:59,610
And then there's the crane games.

1485
02:08:00,390 --> 02:08:04,950
I think cranes are always a classic to have in the world.

1486
02:08:05,250 --> 02:08:07,990
So it's cool that we also got to add the crane games again.

1487
02:08:08,110 --> 02:08:09,950
And then like the design for it and everything.

1488
02:08:10,890 --> 02:08:15,730
And the little had and the logos as well.

1489
02:08:16,570 --> 02:08:17,410
The Doki's bounties.

1490
02:08:17,670 --> 02:08:20,590
And then there's like decals on all the machines and
everything.

1491
02:08:23,630 --> 02:08:24,210
Oh yeah.

1492
02:08:24,590 --> 02:08:27,670
There is a game cabinet that works in here.

1493
02:08:29,450 --> 02:08:30,210
It's called...

1494
02:08:30,210 --> 02:08:31,210
It's basically like Pong.

1495
02:08:32,010 --> 02:08:35,010
So, um, it's it's basically Pong.

1496
02:08:35,550 --> 02:08:36,830
Um, what's it called?

1497
02:08:36,890 --> 02:08:37,450
Tomagan?

1498
02:08:38,030 --> 02:08:39,890
Um, so you can play Pong in my world!

1499
02:08:42,510 --> 02:08:52,510
Um, um so and these are the other cabinets that we have in
this world as well we have dan and dad detective dragon

1500
02:08:52,510 --> 02:09:02,290
freak or treat and tomagon yay little arcade machines at the
saloon and then we have uh a dartboard as well that you can

1501
02:09:02,290 --> 02:09:11,150
play there's darts and playing cards for the dragons and
then there's do ten dookotendo cube um not not related to

1502
02:09:11,150 --> 02:09:15,270
anything else I would like to say parody law.

1503
02:09:17,990 --> 02:09:21,110
So we added a bunch of...

1504
02:09:21,110 --> 02:09:24,750
They added a bunch of the Doki Jam cover art.

1505
02:09:25,770 --> 02:09:26,870
Completely original.

1506
02:09:27,470 --> 02:09:28,730
Trademarked by Doki.

1507
02:09:31,050 --> 02:09:33,470
No relations to anything else.

1508
02:09:35,110 --> 02:09:36,390
But we added some...

1509
02:09:36,390 --> 02:09:39,310
You guys made a lot of amazing games for the Game Jam.

1510
02:09:39,810 --> 02:09:42,550
And we added some of your games into the world as well.

1511
02:09:43,570 --> 02:09:51,710
They're you're gaming our world and here's like a bunch of
the cover art Lolly they give the super chat they can think

1512
02:09:51,710 --> 02:10:00,210
I have no idea what you're talking about and also um at the
saloon There's also like I think I think outlet was very

1513
02:10:00,210 --> 02:10:09,850
inspired by This particular artwork that I'm trying to show
you guys, but Gotta disappear for a sec.

1514
02:10:11,090 --> 02:10:17,190
I think outlet was very inspired in one particular artwork
for the wall mount i'm unsure which one it is at the moment

1515
02:10:17,190 --> 02:10:28,250
uh so um there are in the saloon there's several portraits
that you can find uh that you'll be able to find scattered

1516
02:10:28,250 --> 02:10:36,530
around the saloon and these are some of the things that they
included here and then the fbs level unfortunately this was

1517
02:10:36,530 --> 02:10:42,230
incomplete um like i said there was a lot of stuff to do so
this was one things that they were not able to finalize in

1518
02:10:42,230 --> 02:10:49,750
the end um and it was the fps game that we have that was uh
basically inspired by battle birds from my first from my

1519
02:10:49,750 --> 02:10:59,350
bounty hunter debut so there's a map layout of everything
that you can see here so here's the concept art so like

1520
02:10:59,350 --> 02:11:06,610
where like everything was gonna be at and how everything was
gonna be placed and screenshots of all the

1521
02:11:10,410 --> 02:11:18,530
versus oh I saw something funny that they posted in the
server let me see if I can grab it um oh yeah you know how I

1522
02:11:18,530 --> 02:11:28,210
was talking about like I realized that I was like wait a
minute this game already has a name look I was very busy I

1523
02:11:28,210 --> 02:11:37,930
didn't realize okay I didn't realize because like that that
was an oversight on my end as well because I'm like the

1524
02:11:37,930 --> 02:11:46,930
final check and then I didn't real then the final check I
didn't notice it so it was a little oversight on my part but

1525
02:11:46,930 --> 02:11:59,750
it was also a group effort oversight though like we all
forgot it was a group effort oversight it wasn't it was a

1526
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:06,990
group work and I saw them you know how I mentioned I was
like guys we gotta figure out how to like so I saw them post

1527
02:12:06,990 --> 02:12:16,050
this in the server, so it's like But the logo's sick though
So I was like, put it at the bottom We don't have to Yeah,

1528
02:12:16,050 --> 02:12:17,530
it was a group failure

1529
02:12:21,030 --> 02:12:28,310
I thought that's actually really funny But then the logo was
We just have the logo in the back You know, we got the logo

1530
02:12:28,310 --> 02:12:37,730
shown in the back Because there is the backside But then the
front we put the sign on I think that'll be good and then

1531
02:12:37,730 --> 02:12:46,030
that'll be funny write that down project team the backside
will have the actual the original logo and then the front

1532
02:12:46,030 --> 02:12:51,570
side will be the battle birds and then cardboard on top of
it

1533
02:12:56,890 --> 02:13:08,290
we're like oh yeah we forgot about that yeah the game got
realized but it is an amazing logo shout out to wuka for the

1534
02:13:08,290 --> 02:13:19,650
logo and then here's like the ui of it you'll understand it
when it's when the when we release it um and here are the

1535
02:13:19,650 --> 02:13:29,510
designs for the dokylon fps level and now we're at the
extras oh my gosh we're almost to the end of this so the

1536
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:34,850

a uh the do do do the do the scat like um in the world but

1538
02:13:52,830 --> 02:14:01,630

like just put it as a portrait and the saloon so the la dodo

1539
02:14:01,630 --> 02:14:08,630

weird.

1540
02:14:08,910 --> 02:14:09,890
It felt so...

1541
02:14:09,890 --> 02:14:10,750
It looked so out.

1542
02:14:11,150 --> 02:14:12,490
Oh, and then there's the Sloppy Sisters.

1543
02:14:13,110 --> 02:14:16,210
There's like a bunch of graffiti scattered around.

1544
02:14:17,790 --> 02:14:19,890
Scattered around the world.

1545
02:14:22,570 --> 02:14:23,030
What else?

1546
02:14:23,910 --> 02:14:25,070
Oh, here's more graffiti.

02:14:26,910 --> 02:14:28,330
That's everywhere.

1548
02:14:30,690 --> 02:14:32,570
Looks pretty fucking sick.

1549
02:14:34,170 --> 02:14:35,630
And then here is...

1550
02:14:35,890 --> 02:14:38,270
It's the garrison.

1551
02:14:39,050 --> 02:14:41,250
The tabloids and the...

1552
02:14:41,250 --> 02:14:42,810
The dragoon yaoi.

1553
02:14:45,510 --> 02:14:47,550
I like the tabloid.

1554
02:14:48,090 --> 02:14:50,750
Thirsty dragoon causing deadly water shortage.

1555
02:14:51,330 --> 02:14:53,710
A dragoon caught with another mascot.

1556
02:14:53,990 --> 02:14:55,370
An idle constant.

1557
02:14:55,810 --> 02:14:59,330
Wardrobe malfunction shocks the nation.

1558
02:15:01,090 --> 02:15:03,510
You have anything...

1559
02:15:03,510 --> 02:15:04,490

I want to ask, what's up with you guys and dragoon asses?

1563
02:15:12,730 --> 02:15:12,750

What's up with your fascination with the dragoons behind?

1565
02:15:26,260 --> 02:15:30,060
And then here is Owlet's covers.

1566
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:33,440

1577
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:43,440
We had another one.

1578
02:16:45,520 --> 02:16:48,500
finally, it's like the spaghetti monster religion.

1579
02:16:49,580 --> 02:16:50,320
But this is better.

1580
02:16:51,060 --> 02:16:52,600
We're not here for spaghetti.

1581
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:53,760
We're here for lasagna.

1582
02:16:55,660 --> 02:16:57,740
No, not more dragon butts.

1583
02:16:59,180 --> 02:16:59,580
Campfire.

1584
02:17:00,260 --> 02:17:00,840
Project team.

1585
02:17:00,980 --> 02:17:01,740
Write that down.

1586
02:17:03,300 --> 02:17:06,200
And then, oh my god, we could have had a doggy bed.

1587
02:17:06,700 --> 02:17:19,120
But here are like Oh, Dad's Kids The sloppy meal The dad
burger Better than me Dragoon egg and ham salad Special

1589
02:17:26,740 --> 02:17:38,900
So some more unused concept Like the Dad toys and the Dad

1590
02:17:38,900 --> 02:17:48,640

the wanted posters that this is not all the wanted posters

1591
02:17:48,640 --> 02:17:55,340

well we had some more as well so if you look around there's

1592
02:17:55,340 --> 02:18:03,880

02:18:03,880 --> 02:18:07,200
want to they added the template If you want to create your
own wanted poster.

1594
02:18:08,260 --> 02:18:13,220
And then there are some bloopers that they have their fun in
the server.

1595
02:18:14,140 --> 02:18:20,520
What I love about doing these projects is just seeing, you
know, a bunch of people coming together and, like, just

1596
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:24,660
working together for one thing.

1597
02:18:25,240 --> 02:18:28,860
And it's really cool to see everyone bonding and stuff in.

1598
02:18:30,560 --> 02:18:31,680

1608
02:19:52,500 --> 02:20:03,680
it's crazy Yeah, they got into They got into a little bit
Into Uma Musume In the middle of the project Yeah, they

1609
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:05,060
started talking about Uma Musume

1610
02:20:10,680 --> 02:20:13,060
And what else What else is in the...

1611
02:20:13,060 --> 02:20:22,560
Oh yeah, and then they were researching Yowie for For
research, of course They were out there Trying to figure out

1612
02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:33,220
how to make Yowie, I guess And then Then they, yeah, they
had to do, apparently they did a playtest session where they

1613
02:20:33,220 --> 02:20:37,460
got, what the fuck?

1614
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:40,740
Where the fuck did Godzilla show up?

1615
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:45,440
Okay, so Godzilla made a visit to Dokila.

1616
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:50,340
Yeah, quote-unquote research.

1617
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:53,100
Yeah, the king of monsters.

1618
02:20:54,140 --> 02:20:56,360
Legally distinct, Godzilla.

1619
02:20:57,480 --> 02:21:00,420
Yeah, God... See, I told you guys.

1620
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:03,780
Dokilan is so popular, guys.

1621
02:21:04,140 --> 02:21:05,540
Come visit Dokilan.

1622
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:07,340
Godzilla went.

1623
02:21:10,500 --> 02:21:11,320
Look at that.

1624
02:21:11,380 --> 02:21:12,980
We got a vouch from Godzilla.

1625
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:19,860
And here's more playtest.

1626
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:23,940
Here's more Uma Musume from the crew.

1627
02:21:26,500 --> 02:21:28,780
And that's all this lies.

1628
02:21:29,420 --> 02:21:39,180
All right, so here is everyone that worked incredibly hard
throughout the last couple of months from the entire project

1629
02:21:39,180 --> 02:21:39,820
team.

1630
02:21:40,820 --> 02:21:46,180
Like I said, so the project leader is Joule, otherwise known
as Kusako.

1631
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:55,840
And then there's the 3D team is Squid, Ores, Salted Fish,
Legends, and Haske.

1632
02:21:56,040 --> 02:21:57,720
You might recognize all of these people.

1633
02:21:57,720 --> 02:22:01,240
We have worked with them many, many times in the past.

1634
02:22:01,780 --> 02:22:04,600
A huge shout out to the 3D team and Entity.

1635
02:22:04,940 --> 02:22:06,060
He was also...

1636
02:22:06,060 --> 02:22:09,360
Entity and Kusako were both the cameraman goons as well in
the world.

1637
02:22:09,740 --> 02:22:15,460
So they stayed up the entire stream to work on the cameras
for the world as well.

1638
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:17,980
So a huge shout out to them.

1639
02:22:18,460 --> 02:22:23,840
And then here are the concept artists and the graphics and
the 3D models team.

1640
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:27,700
So we have Will, Jim.

1641
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:36,940
and allette they did the concept art uh naki wuka and orca
did the logos orca came in literally two days before the

1642
02:22:36,940 --> 02:22:44,380
world the stream debuted because i needed and i needed an
actual logo for it like like as if like you know we're at an

1646
02:23:05,420 --> 02:23:09,140
And then Katsumi, Ryu, and Rika did the 3D model art.

1647

Posting in the description of this PowerPoint.

1652
02:23:27,700 --> 02:23:37,140
so everyone can look into the PowerPoint themselves and
check out all the amazing talented work beautiful work that

1653
02:23:37,140 --> 02:23:38,400
the whole team did.

1654
02:23:39,220 --> 02:23:47,700
This project like I said was in the works for since July or
June I don't remember.

1655
02:23:48,240 --> 02:23:53,960
Oh I wanted to show you guys this so one of the things, one
of my feedback that I gave them was I felt like it was so

1656
02:23:53,960 --> 02:23:56,700
like the world felt a little too empty.

1657
02:23:57,320 --> 02:24:07,720
Um because like um here's something that i gave as feedback
as well as um so originally you can tell that um there was

1658
02:24:07,720 --> 02:24:15,780
it was just like this um this was like a week before like i
think it was like four to five days before the stream and

1659
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:22,860
this was like a big criticism criticisms i had during the
feedback session where i felt like it just felt like super

1660
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:28,900
empty and there was like just a lot of space around the
world and after that when you go into the world you might

1661
02:24:28,900 --> 02:24:35,200
notice like that's so different like it um it's not like
that anymore um you can see from here too like it was so

1662
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:42,100
empty where it was just like just a rat like just sand
texture and that's why it felt it feels more alive now so i

1663
02:24:42,100 --> 02:24:48,780
had just like put some dragons there some more NPCs
scattered around um some like you know stuff sticking out of

1664
02:24:48,780 --> 02:25:00,280
the sand because it's fucking sand sand is very annoying so
so they added all of that they added like rocks sand there's

1665
02:25:00,280 --> 02:25:09,200
gonna be tumbleweeds added in too later on um and everything
so um it was like a huge refurbishment um in in just like

1666
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:16,040
four to five days that teams did that the project team did
so huge shout out to them for um being able to implement all

1667
02:25:16,040 --> 02:25:26,100
of that like so quickly um yeah so it feels more alive which
is something that um i wanted i wanted to feel like a lot

1668
02:25:26,100 --> 02:25:33,640
more alive and it felt like you know it felt like something
like it felt like an actual world that you think can exist

1669
02:25:33,640 --> 02:25:46,940
other than the whole like creepy uh life-size uh chickens
running around uh by creepy i meant like you know I would be

1670
02:25:46,940 --> 02:26:01,740
scared if I saw Dragoons like actual giant chickens that
could potentially crush me in the real world running around

1671
02:26:08,460 --> 02:26:17,280
what chickens we are dragons yeah It's alright.

1672
02:26:18,340 --> 02:26:21,920
Lovely giant chickens in the real world.

1673
02:26:24,300 --> 02:26:25,620
In an amusement park.

1674
02:26:26,420 --> 02:26:29,060
And also that can speak the human language.

1675
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:41,420
But yeah, like I said, I wanted to make this world felt a
lot.

1676
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:44,840
I think the team was able to accomplish that too.

1677
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:55,740
It felt so like, you know, going into the world, from where
it started to where it is now, it's like from zero to a

1678
02:26:55,740 --> 02:26:56,060
hundred.

1679
02:26:56,240 --> 02:27:01,360
Like there are so many things they added in that they were
able to do so in such a short amount of time to just like

1680
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:07,220
make it feel more immersive and more alive and less empty.

1681
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:14,660
So like I said, yay, congratulations to the project team for
their incredible hard work.

1682
02:27:15,880 --> 02:27:17,140
When's the next update?

1683
02:27:17,220 --> 02:27:18,900
Here's several questions I think you guys might have.

1684
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:19,960
What's the next update?

1685
02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:21,220
When will the world be public?

1686
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:25,040
The next update, I am unsure.

1687
02:27:25,500 --> 02:27:29,880
Like I said, it really depends on the team themselves.

1688
02:27:30,200 --> 02:27:32,940
I think they deserve a nice break right now.

1689
02:27:33,640 --> 02:27:38,720
Right now, before they go into another, you know, before
they go into another session.

1690
02:27:42,320 --> 02:27:45,500
And, you know, I want them to, I'll figure out another dead
left.

1691
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:48,040
It'll be, maybe it'll be a special event.

1692
02:27:48,600 --> 02:27:49,700
It'll be for an anniversary.

1693
02:27:50,040 --> 02:27:50,780
No, not an anniversary.

1694
02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:51,560
That's way too soon.

1695
02:27:51,660 --> 02:27:52,580
Maybe it'll be for a birthday.

1696
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:58,440
Maybe it'll be for like Christmas, Halloween, like a, or
maybe it'll be for another new year countdown.

1697
02:27:58,640 --> 02:27:59,240
Who knows?

1698
02:28:01,460 --> 02:28:02,080
We'll see.

1699
02:28:02,160 --> 02:28:02,960
We'll see how it goes.

1700
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:04,720
There's a lot of things I want to add.

1701
02:28:05,540 --> 02:28:13,180
And, you know, it takes time to cook something amazing for
all of you guys.

1702
02:28:15,520 --> 02:28:26,980
ruin asses i think you that i'm the wrong person to ask i
think you gotta ask alette about that and will and when will

1703
02:28:26,980 --> 02:28:35,580
this world be public like i said there are a few things we
gotta fix real quick um but i will let you guys know as soon

1704
02:28:35,580 --> 02:28:44,600
as i can um maybe maybe it'll be a week maybe it'll take
around a week or so uh but we will see um there's a little

1705
02:28:44,600 --> 02:28:49,760
some minor things that I do want to tweak and want to add
into the world that we weren't able to add before.

1706
02:28:50,760 --> 02:28:55,260
But we'll aim for the end of next week to make a public
release.

1707
02:28:56,460 --> 02:28:58,120
But yeah, I think that's everything.

1708
02:28:58,820 --> 02:28:59,500
I think that's everything.

1709
02:28:59,660 --> 02:29:04,760
I hope you guys enjoyed the behind the scenes of Dokilon.

1710
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:07,880
The happiest place on earth.

1711
02:29:08,980 --> 02:29:10,260
And also the most expensive.

1712
02:29:14,380 --> 02:29:15,500
And also...

1713
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:18,520
Definitely the most expensive place on earth.

1714
02:29:22,690 --> 02:29:26,490
I think my favorite part is just adding the Easter eggs and
stuff.

1715
02:29:28,490 --> 02:29:30,050
It's just nice to see.

1716
02:29:34,050 --> 02:29:35,670
I have so many tabs, guys.

1717
02:29:37,190 --> 02:29:39,710
I'm trying to find my streaming tab.

1718
02:29:40,390 --> 02:29:43,190
I was like, where did I start my stream?

1719
02:29:44,010 --> 02:29:44,830
Oh, there it is.

1720
02:29:46,270 --> 02:29:46,950
I found it.

1721
02:29:47,450 --> 02:29:48,790
I found my streaming tab.

1722
02:29:54,950 --> 02:29:57,290
Yeah, no, I think I might have to buy another.

1723
02:29:57,830 --> 02:30:00,570
I might have to buy another mouse pad.

1724
02:30:01,310 --> 02:30:04,050
I tried using soap and to rub it off.

1725
02:30:04,250 --> 02:30:04,810
I don't know.

1726
02:30:05,170 --> 02:30:05,650
I don't know.

1727
02:30:05,730 --> 02:30:06,970
I think it's cooked, guys.

1728
02:30:10,290 --> 02:30:14,330
Why buy a one-day pass when you can buy a year past the
dokeelon?

1729
02:30:14,790 --> 02:30:16,410
Just like those Disney passes.

1730
02:30:17,510 --> 02:30:18,510
Don't worry, guys.

1752
02:33:12,380 --> 02:33:20,760
lot to the team as well as my staff members as well so but

incredibly high and i cannot wait for you dry wounds to be
able to experience the world yourself and see all the things
