38
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,840

like for those who are confused during the member stream we

39
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,300
were trying to figure out if I was in a tournament or not
because like um I got the discord invite for the tournament

40
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:06,400
like like literally like an hour and I think like two and a
half hours ago and then like the tournament was supposed is

41
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:16,940
tomorrow so um so I was like freaking out because I was just
like what am I am I in I don't know it's tomorrow and then

42
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:25,360
my apparently like was like um like some apparently like my
invite got lost like my discord invite got lost and there

43
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,340
was like a lot of confusion about it because like they got
mixed up about who's it like about like my participation in

44
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:38,820
the tournament and they got me swap switched up with someone
else like they like someone else was supposed to be the sub

45
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,980
um but they were accidentally put in the main main
tournament and then i got swapped they like they got me and

46
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:52,320
this other person mixed up so um they had to like figure
because i told them i told the organizers like i'm confused

47
00:06:52,320 --> 00:07:00,120
because i was counting the official list and i counted like
30 because the player count was 36 and i was counting it not

48
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:08,020
including me if included me it would have been 37 so i was
so confused and i was like the last i was like one of the

49
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:13,240
not the last person in the discord but like one of the last
people in the discord because everyone else all the other

50
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:19,160
like players were there and then like I got really confused
because I was like, wait, my name's not on the list.

51
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,760
And also, if I play, I would be the 37th player.

52
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,020
So then I was like, because the organizers sent me a
discreet invite to the server.

53
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,500
So like, they think they were like, yeah, you're in the
tournament.

54
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,780
And I got in the server and I was like, wait, but where's my
name?

55
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,620
And then I was like, I don't know what's going on.

56
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,540
And then they were like, it got back to me after the match.

57
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:52,720
member stream so i was so confused and i was like do what do
i do do i show up the

58
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:11,380
bad at the list do i show up and then and then it was like

62
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't understand.

63
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,860
And they, like, swapped me with the other person because
they got mixed up between the two.

64
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:31,720
I don't know.

65
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:38,380

know, I was going to eloterize because I was really sad

66
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,540
because I was just like, I don't know if I'm in or not.

You can use VC in matches too.

81

You want to yell at people.

82
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,020
I think people, I think people will know who you are the
moment you use VC, but that's fine.

83
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,580
But you want to yell at people.

109
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,160
It's because I was doing...

110
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,540
It's because I'm not full of screen, so I'll do that now.

111
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,200
Oh my god, we have three streams.

And it was, like, a full lobby.

122
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,840
So I was just like, oh, oh.

123
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,040

Yeah, public humiliation ritual.

125
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,320
Yeah, they invited me just to be like, you're not in.

126
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,960
I thought I was just like, what?

127
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,100
Just like, quietly in the background.

128
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,720
Just to be like, yes, who's not in actually?

129
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,300
That was me crying.

130
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,250

144
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,400
Is this not hot?

145
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:26,840

162
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't understand it's how I cry I thought it's a cry
reveal are you not do not like my cry review I'm revealing

163
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:56,340
my cry oh goodbye Ty and I love it oh bro I'm fucking high
in here Wow That...

164
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,320
That is unfortunate.

165
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,480
Um, I'm almost there though.

166
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,680
You're sick, so it's different.

167
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,120
There's a banger of the name.

168
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,620
That's why I say I love Bravo's names.

169
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,200
Let's cry.

170
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,900
I have not stopped right-clicking since I started crying.

171
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,480
There's no way you're asking me to a right-click harder.

172
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,720
Like, I literally have just been spitting balls out.

173
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,580
There's no way.

174
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,480
I can't spit it out harder.

175
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,200
It's, like, literally just ingrained.

176
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,860
I don't think we're winning this, but it's okay.

177
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,460
That means my team is losing, Elo.

178
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,460
It's not just me.

179
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,860
My entire team is responsible for today.

180
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,200
Look, I really want to up, but you guys gotta push up,
though.

181
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,260
Like, I don't know how I'm going to up this if none of you
push up.

182
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,220
Fuck this, here you go.

183
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,860
Okay, like, there's nothing I could do about that.

184
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:09,560
Nice.

185
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,640
As there's, I am doing everything I can.

186
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,820
Oh, you see this?

187
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,500
You see how I'm right-clicking so fucking hard right now?

188
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:26,520
Like, the only time I have not right-clicked is when I have
to reload my gun.

189
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,780
Risa and Fajra, thank you for the raid.

190
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,100
Thank you.

191
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:31,660
Thank you.

192
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,200
We had a great stream.

193
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,020
Thank you.

194
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,240
I did feel bad, though, that the other girl

195
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,180
was moved over.

196
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,160
Because, you know, someone, there's like winners and losers.

197
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,160
It's okay.

198
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,220
If one of us dies,

199
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,840
Yeah, I felt bad about that.

200
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,660
Oh, hey.

201
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,200
You first, yeah.

202
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,960
I tolerate raccoons.

203
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,400
But now, now I hate...

204
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,820
I hate mutants more.

205
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:24,960
Alright.

206
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,300
Oh, nice.

207
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,640
Oh, not nice for this guy.

208
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:43,490
I've always hated what do you mean what you I've always
hated mutants more it has not changed oh that is not good

209
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:54,670
that is that is not good well my all this self my ult is
gone all right it's fine

210
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:07,020
I've I've not stopped healing I'm sorry man Like, you cannot
blame me on that.

211
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,710
I've been spitting them out.

212
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,740
We unfortunately do not have a Naruto anymore.

213
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,360
I hear you.

214
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,100
I've been clear regarding what I hate since the beginning of
season zero.

215
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,000
This is Magneto's America.

216
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,320
And I've had enough!

217
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,360
I've had enough!

218
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,460
I speak for the humans!

219
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,880
I speak for the humans!

220
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,280
Yeah, mutants have always been my number one.

221
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,160
There we go.

222
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
Whoa!

223
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,980
That's right, again!

224
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,440
And again!

225
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:18,540
Don't worry, as a almost human representative, I will speak
for all of you.

226
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,400
I'm like at least 10% human.

227
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:46,420
But I think I am at least 10% human, so I am just to fight
to speak for all of you you're not a human you're Canadian

228
00:19:46,420 --> 00:20:06,400
you know bananas have like was it 10% human DNA I'm friends
with a lot of humans yeah I think it was like how many

229
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:13,760
percent was it I don't think it's 10% but I know it has an X
amount of percentage of human DNA.

230
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,040
So that doesn't mean banana...

231
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,780
That doesn't...

232
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,120
Oh yeah, 50%.

233
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,240
Sorry, that was me underselling it, apparently.

234
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,640
Bananas have almost 50% human DNA.

235
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,160
So that means that, guys, that doesn't rule out tomatoes.

236
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,380
I don't know, someone saw a banana and was like, that's a
sexy banana.

237
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:47,820
our cousins with bananas the banana started crying and then
the human was like dots he's like

238
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:05,960
fuck the banana do not the banana

239
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,160
Okay, I think it's human nature when like, you're like, can
I, can I bang that?

240
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,260
That's human nature.

241
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,600
Uh, yeah, but with holes, sorry, not with that.

242
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,320
Yeah, with holes.

243
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,580
They're like, can I stick the PP in there?

244
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,560
That's like, bananas are more human than mutants.

245
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,280
And that's why bananas have more rights.

246
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,360
Oh, that guy is dead, dude.

247
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,420
Don't worry, Thor.

248
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,060
Don't worry.

249
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,800
Take this.

250
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,460
That's why we love bananas more than we love mutants.

251
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,580
Oh, good for the Thor.

252
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,200
Alright.

253
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,300
Nice.

254
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,360
Oh, shit.

255
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:24,100
That guy got fucked up It's a penny still a lot the penny is
still a lot only because the wings the web stuff is still

256
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:30,050
here Thank you

257
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:46,560
You don't know that You don't know if there might be human
DNA and tomatoes You don't know that Oh shit, that's the

258
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:53,100
moon is here The moon is looking nice tonight Don't worry, I
have res.

259
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,060
Die on point!

260
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,720
Die on point, I have res.

261
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,300
Okay.

262
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,620
I no longer have res.

263
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,120
How do we even fact check that?

264
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,660
You can't trust the internet no more.

265
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,300
You can only trust Doki News.

266
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,640
The internet is written by a mutant apologist.

267
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,940
The only source of information you can trust is Doki News.

268
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,960
Yeah, that's right.

269
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,460
Yeah, exactly.

270
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,440
And Doki News says that tomatoes have human DNA.

271
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,810
Yeah, AI is mutant based.

272
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,490
Exactly.

273
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,600
Don't worry.

274
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,060
I will be the noose that you can trust.

275
00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:01,260
I will be there for the people, for the humans.

276
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,990
Oh, nice.

277
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:08,710
Cool.

278
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,730
Yeah!

279
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,570
Rocket!

280
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:18,430
Yeah!

281
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,250
Rocket!

282
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,850
For the people, for the humans!

283
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,630
Just like in Greendale, we are for the humans.

284
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,100
Gotta get my water.

285
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:45,780
Yay!

286
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,260
My team was just ignoring you didn't have much of a choice.

287
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,840
I have Thor.

288
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,020
I mean, I don't think our Thor was the...

289
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,220
the threat here.

290
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,360
Our Thor with the four final hits?

291
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,110
It's okay.

292
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,430
Of course.

293
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,390
Of course a gooning dragon says that.

294
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,330
Of course.

295
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,680
It's okay.

296
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:37,060
You know, the only sad part about being in an alt account is
that we don't have our favorite our favorite emote.

297
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,120
Ew, we have a fucking mutant on my screen.

298
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,540
Get that shit out of here.

299
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,040
It's alright.

300
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,260
Even though you can't dance for me.

301
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,320
Wait, how do I...

302
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,140
I don't remember how I put you on my screen.

303
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,720
It's been too long.

304
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,900
Oh, there we go.

305
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:58,900
Alright.

306
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,600
No!

307
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,600
I have a stupid mutant on my screen.

308
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:05,880
Okay.

309
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:28,040
cake is cake yeah but wolverine's cake is flat as fuck he
should be ashamed of himself

310
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:38,720
oh shit tabbed out i'm scared of tabbing out in this game
now because like when i i tabbed out like i did like an

311
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:47,340
off-stream game just to like warm up also i i did need it to
um oh wait what is this oh my god it's dancing most with ice

312
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:58,460
king oh my god guys important update look at this anyway i
did an off-stream game to warm up and i had to play it

313
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:03,620
anyway because you know tournaments tomorrow yeah warm up
warm up they did have one because they banned the character

314
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:14,040
um wait what was i talking about i already forgot before the
important update part

315
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,500
sorry i got i lost my train of thought

316
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:38,720
oh yeah i played a game i had to play i played a game off
stream um off stream to to just like warm up a little bit

317
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:50,300
and then um and then I tabbed out, like it was the first
game, I tabbed out and then my entire PC crashed.

318
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,800
So now I'm paranoid as fuck now about tabbing in and out.

319
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,480
Why is Ice King dressed up?

320
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:05,740
Because in one episode, he became his natural pure element.

321
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,900
He's like fit as fuck.

322
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:19,800
He's not actually, that's just his beard, but during his
most, pure this pure element and he's going on a date he's

323
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:36,060
gotta look hot he's gotta know that look nice for his
princess i don't unfortunately on this account we do not

324
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:45,040
have we do not have our gooner skin unfortunately oh my gosh
i've added my i should have added my main account and

325
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,300
started gifting my alt account gooner skins.

326
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,040
I just don't plan my ults to justify this.

327
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:57,960
The only reason why this ul was even oh I am sorry.

328
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:08,060
The only reason why this ults is even this elo is because my
manager wanted people to play, wanted someone to play rivals

329
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:12,920
with and then I ranked it up for him.

330
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,960
I was like, okay.

331
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,580
Oh.

332
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,200
Oh, that's embarrassing.

333
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:30,620
Alright.

334
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,490
But yeah, I said like, I'll help you.

335
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,070
I'll help you rank up.

336
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,030
For like this season.

337
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,710
And I was like, that is the only reason why I have a high.

338
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,750
Like, not high, you know, it's GM.

339
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,810
That's also the only reason why I have a GM account, I'll
check out.

340
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:58,470
Because I said, okay, I shall help you this season.

341
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:04,290
Because he's like, he complained to me about how he's in Elo
hell.

342
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:10,570
He's in Elo hell and he's solo cute.

343
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,250
I felt bad and I was like, okay, this season I play.

344
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,290
Oh, I don't like that.

345
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,970
What is that?

346
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,370
Oh, oh, no.

347
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,330
Oh, no.

348
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,430
We don't need it, right?

349
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,570
That's unfortunate that we don't need it.

350
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,990
I could have saved this.

351
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,170
It's alright.

352
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:47,970
Come back.

353
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,290
Come back.

354
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,210
Or a zoo.

355
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,030
I already copied.

356
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,910
I didn't think we won.

357
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,110
See, look, we got kills.

358
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,090
It was worth it.

359
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,730
It was worth it.

360
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,610
We got kills.

361
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,030
We got staggers.

362
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,390
You cannot say that wasn't worth it when we got staggers.

363
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:15,610
Look at that.

364
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,030
We got two, three, we got another stagger.

365
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,130
All because I ulted it there.

366
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,970
Oh, the coward.

367
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,970
So you're welcome.

368
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:28,690

00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,630
Literally all me.

370
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:35,030
Oh, yeah.

371
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:35,650
Oh, more.

372
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,330
Whoa, whoa.

373
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,730
Is that fucking more staggers?

374
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,730
Holy shit.

Oh, never mind.

378
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,590

00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,470

388

That was not aura.

389
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,410
That was my bad.

390
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,370
It's okay.

391
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,230
It doesn't matter.

392
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,450
We still win this.

393
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,450
Look at that aura.

394
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,650
We only win this because of my aura.

395
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,670
It's still worked out.

396
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,690
It's still worked out.

397
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:44,050
It does.

398
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,830
I made a mistake and we still win.

399
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,750
So in the end, is it really a mistake?

400
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,490
It can't be a mistake if we're winning.

401
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,610
If you think about it.

402
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,910
That is not good.

403
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,650
There we go.

404
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,610
Who the fuck did I kill?

405
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,110

00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,160
Oh my god, they're trying Storm again?

430
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,540

I did not realize he was gonna fucking die.

434
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,720
I did not realize they were both gonna die that fast.

435
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,300
It's okay, guys.

436
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,160
It's not okay.

437
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,780
Our stranger might be dead, but...

438
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,340
Okay, it's okay.

439
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,080
I have two of me.

440
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,720

00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,580
Okay, there is...

442
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,060

He messed up.

444
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,820
Oh, my...

445
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,960
My God.

00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,640
Jesus Christ.

447
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,940
That is a lot of damage, I will say.

448
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,320
I am trying so hard to heal everybody right now.

449
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,900
Alright, I'm building my nano booster.

450
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,560
Okay.

451
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,100
It's okay, right?

452
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,760
Everything is okay, right?

453
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,740
Oh, he has one!

454
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,340
Oh!

455
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,800
He was one.

456
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,040
He still is one!

457
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,740
Oh my God.

458
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,600
You're flying.

459
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,340
It's so hard to hit.

460
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,880
So good luck.

461
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:02,820
Wait, this sucks.

462
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,300

00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:07,870
It's so fine.

477
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,690
There are so many things on my screen.

478
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,910
But I think we're okay.

479
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,610

00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:22,970
Oh no.

486
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,690
It's right here.

487
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,110
He's coming closer.

488
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,370
He's coming closer for people.

489
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,550
Oh, he's got a lot of them.

490
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:37,230
Look, I use my Involve so like good luck everyone.

491

00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:47,990
Okay, it's fine, it's fine.

494
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:48,590
We're okay.

495
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,210
I had to use that.

496
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:51,950
I got scared.

497
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,950

498
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,270
Every time I use Involve, it's me inking.

We take those, but I also have to avoid this person.

537
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,540
At first, you know, I gave her the benefit of doubt.

538
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,420
I was like, you know what?

539
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,140
She might have got the odd, but I literally saw her hold it.

540
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,460
She held it for that game, and she was so lucky we had TP.

541
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,400
She almost sold there.

542

00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,560

613
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,920
Nothing to worry about.

Are you gonna love this one?

619
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,120
Oh, she's streaming late.

620
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:55,340
Joke's on you.

You know, they'll be fine, right?

624
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:06,720
Yeah, they'll be fine.

625
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,020
That was a good ass up.

626
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,200
Yeah.

627
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,440
It's not because I'm streaming late.

628
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,140
That's because it's never stopped.

629
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,960
I say as I hack my lungs out.

630
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:28,680

See, nothing to worry about.

633
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,280
See, if we went double support.

634
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,540
Okay, that was my bad.

635
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,840
That was...

636
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,500
That might have been my bad, guys.

637
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,900
Alright, guys, you might not have a support, but it's okay.

638
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,360
You don't need a support.

639
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:55,420
It's okay.

640
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,120

did not have their odds that's why they held it that makes
more sense oh okay oh man if only we had a mag oh that'd be

687
00:53:50,000 --> 00:54:04,880
pretty neat oh my god are you serious all right let's just
get it let's get it let's get it I have many faces.

688
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,360
Big meat!

689
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,840
Oh, I fucking actually pressed shift.

690
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,480
That is not good.

691
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,140
I did not mean a pressed shift, but that's okay.

692
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:26,580
Oh, wait, C9.

693
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:26,980

694
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:27,980

697
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,000
It's okay.

698
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,960
There's a reason why both teams are in this Elo.

699
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,180
But Doki, you're in this Elo.

700
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:38,380
It's by choice.

701
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,960
It's not by choice for the others.

702
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:51,490
Okay, okay, look.

703
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,490
Our Invis did not turn to my right.

704
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,110
Turning up the heat.

705
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:02,410
And here we go again.

706
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:05,930
Actually, I don't know if I should definitely swap off Loki.

707
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,150

I'm reclaiming it.

798
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:19,600
He hasn't played in six seasons.

And that's why he has a fucking 30.

800

He has that have a win rate.

801
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,760
Because he's just been farming low Elo.

802
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,260

I'm basically a black bar right.

837
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:31,420
I haven't played Mantis in a long ass time, so let's see.

838
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:36,160
Let's see how how handicapped I am right now.

01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,040
Oh my god, it's Moon Knight versus Moon Knight fucking.

840
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,760
Since I got triple support, I'm going to keep...

01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:25,120
No, it's not.

848
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:25,880
I never seen them.

849
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,800
That's where they go, and we need more damage output.

850
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:29,580
What the fuck?

851
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,860
Oh my god, this guy is stupid because it's this map, but
that's no.

852
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:35,860
He has not been outside of GM.

853
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,140
You can tell.

854
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:43,120
Because I do never see Hawkeye Moon Knight unless, like,
it's Moxie, and he's the Hawkeye Master.

855
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:49,340
Like, I'm like, bro, that is not because of this map.

856
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,500
That is not what this people play on this map.

857
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,960
Nice, nice, nice.

858
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:58,060
I'm going to rush the back line.

859
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,200
I got close.

860
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:01,860
Focus pin as well.

861
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,520
Boy, I can't roll.

862
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,180
I'm kind of sick.

863
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,720
Oh, she got res, guys.

864
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:11,160
Oh.

865
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:14,300
I'm harassing them over here.

866
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:15,960
Stopping them from moving.

867
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,180
But I need someone to help me secure them, though.

868
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:18,720
I can't.

869
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:20,580
I don't have the DPS as much.

870
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:21,200
We kill two.

871
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:23,200
Guys, okay, I need you guys.

872
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,820
I'm gonna see you guys.

873
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:27,260
Okay.

874
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:30,740
Alright.

875
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,360
This Eno is very interesting.

876
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:34,200
I'll say it.

877
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,800
This is a very, very interesting Eno.

878
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:38,840
I shouldn't even out there, bro.

879
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,240
I should have like put two and two together to punish these
young.

880
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,880
That was just like, I heard him out.

881
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,440
But then I realized both the healers are on me.

882
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:50,400
Bro, oh my god, he's having a life story right now.

883
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,580
He's trying to like and analyze everything.

884
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:55,580
It's crazy.

885
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:55,920
Get free on cart.

886
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:56,580
Let's get free on cart.

887
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,660
We're overextending right now.

888
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:58,800
Bro, what?

889
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,020
We don't gotta.

890
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,680
Our, our, our Luna overextended for sure.

891
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:04,760
I would say that.

892
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,540
But that one of the hills will be my program.

893
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,300
I've only got Matthews going right now.

894
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:09,940
I got no ragged.

895
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,240
Okay, bruh.

01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:51,890
Look at that.

923
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:52,970
I started the fight.

He's so fucking confident.

01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:00,390
All right, so.

936
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:02,430
Did they play Mag?

937
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:03,690
I think we need a score, girl.

938
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:05,310
He did not play Mag, right?

939
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:06,410
It's close to have.

940
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:10,810
No, Moxie's in eternity.

941
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:12,070
I thought I'm in eternity.

942
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:23,790
Bro, what the fuck is he saying?

943
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:24,490
Yeah.

944
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:28,650
There's no way that guy heard what he said.

945
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:29,970
Wait, did they play mag?

946
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:30,630
They were.

947
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:34,090
I swear to God, I saw, I felt like I saw zero mag.

948
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:34,930
Okay, I did not.

949
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:37,710
God damn it, I'll never be able to play this game.

950
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:41,370
I am not playing.

951
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:42,930
I'm not playing mag.

I'm not going to make sense.

971
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,040
The Bucky's back.

972
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,080
He's going to try to block me.

973
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:47,360
Oh, no ways.

974
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:47,900
Got to block.

975
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:49,960
Unfortunate.

976
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:51,820
I don't know why he's on Storm.

977
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:55,260
I'm going to keep trying to, like, block the hot guy shots
with my body.

978
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:57,120
Oh, my God.

01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:47,930
Give me a solid hug.

1024
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:50,930
I told you.

1025
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:53,370
Me being in the silo is a choice.

1026
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:54,450
That's just a lot of good.

1027
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:55,710
I'm not going to do.

1028
01:17:58,850 --> 01:17:59,450
No!

1029
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:02,450
Oh, you never missed that.

1030
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:06,030
I'm just gonna occasionally pick this up.

1031
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:07,830
I got his own install!

1032
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:11,250
Both the Luna and the fucking squirrel girl.

1033
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:13,550
I got you with that though.

1034
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:15,970
Maybe I do.

1035
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:18,190
This deal has a choice.

1036
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:26,130
I am ready to put on a show.

1037
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:28,110
I told you.

1038
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:30,690
Just use cards covered.

1039
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:34,310
I'm gonna keep trying to block the Hawkeye shots.

1040
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:35,450
I told you guys.

1041
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:38,710
I... This is very...

1042
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:39,970
This is special.

1043
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:42,350
Only...

1044
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,750
I know only in this.

1045
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:45,010
Okay, I need an ult here.

1046
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:47,570
There we go.

1047
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:51,190
I better see this ult.

1048
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:52,650
There we go.

1049
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:53,990
I'm not gonna ult, bro.

1050
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:54,850
They already like this.

1051
01:18:56,450 --> 01:19:07,030
oh i just killed everything that was crazy i that was that

this point it's it's you it's not the game i'm sorry like

01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:25,070
they're like i don't know why i can't get out are you
serious I can't get out of GM.

1054
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:26,610
There's a reason.

1055
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:28,270
And I saw that reason.

1056
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:35,880
Yeah.

1057
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:40,040
That's okay.

1058
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:41,440
My moon night comes back.

1059
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,320
I've got no bubble for you, sir.

1060
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:45,140
You got you dead.

1061
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:46,420
That's okay.

1062
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:47,140
He's fine.

1063
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:51,980
Don't keep there already dead.

1064
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:53,160
I'm on the plane.

1065
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:54,700
Mommy's just cute.

1066
01:19:58,140 --> 01:19:59,120
All right, here we go.

1067
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:00,440
That's crazy.

1068
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:03,960
The fact that I took someone down with me.

1069
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:04,940
Oh, random pot shot.

1070
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,000
I don't think he's done on you.

1071
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:09,820
Yeah, I knew it.

1072
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,800
I'm fucking backing out, bro.

1073
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,700
That hot guy is not taking me down.

1074
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:24,000
If Moxie didn't take me down during that preview, none of
these guys are taking me.

1075
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,420
That's fucking right.

1076
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:31,140
There we go.

1077
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:33,620
I'm gonna knock off all.

1078
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:35,480
Alright, nice.

1079
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:40,660
Bro, I'm not letting a GM Hawkeye take me down.

1080
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:41,620
Bro.

1081
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,300
I managed to dodge all of Moxie's headshots during the
preview stream.

1082
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:51,740
Like, Siphon tanked all of the fucking headshots and I
dodged all of them.

1083
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:59,940
I'm not letting some G GM Hawk, I take me down.

1084
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:01,920
Yeah.

1085
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:03,520
GG, time to be in Celestial.

1086
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:04,600
Evolution.

1087
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,440
Dude, congrats.

1088
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:10,060
I'm proud of you, man.

1089
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:11,360
I got GM1.

1090
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:13,780
All right, good luck, boys.

1091
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:15,500
Another epic victory.

1092
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:17,560
Yay.

1093
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:19,860
Yippee!

1094
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:25,890
I'm rushing the stream.

1095
01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:27,450
It's because I'm on my third stream.

1096
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:29,490
All right.

1097
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:30,310
Yeah!

1098
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:35,050
Oh my gosh, God, I'm gonna be a damn one!

1099
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:37,750
Oh my gosh!

1100
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:42,230
They're gonna be so proud of me!

1101
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:48,770
They're gonna be so proud of me!

1102
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:52,590
Who's that?

1103
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:55,230
They are gonna be proud of me!

1104
01:21:58,190 --> 01:21:58,830
Boom!

1105
01:21:59,410 --> 01:21:59,490
Boom!

1106
01:21:59,510 --> 01:22:01,890
Bum, bum, bum.

1107
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:11,130
Little Doki gonna be GM1.

1108
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:15,730
Um, I'm sorry, but I'm actually not Doki Bird.

1109
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:19,910
Um, you got mistaken.

1110
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:29,970
Now, not Doki Bird is gonna hang out and flex her new emote
that she got for the first time.

1111
01:22:30,830 --> 01:22:32,250
Where are my people?

1112
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:33,690
Oh my god.

1113
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:35,110
Wow.

1114
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:40,880
Oh.

1115
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:42,440
Hey guys.

1116
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,240

01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,480

No, those are good.

1134
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:16,750
I made my mark.

1135
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:18,450
Okay, now I'm going to test you again.

1136
01:24:19,510 --> 01:24:20,430
It was top 200.

1137
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:21,530
I got top 200.

1138
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:22,910
I ended top 200.

1139
01:24:24,150 --> 01:24:24,350
Yeah.

1140
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:25,510
And I called it.

1141
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:28,530
Wait, hold on, bro.

1142
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:29,510
Hold on.

1143
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:30,610
Do I even answer it?

1144
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:32,670
No!

1145
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:35,430
Can I...

1146
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:36,470
Fucking hell, okay.

1147
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:40,730
Yeah, I made my mark and then I just fuck around.

1148
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:43,510
Because my voice is not my main content.

1149
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:46,570
Dude, I recently...

1150
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:48,390
I, like, took Jolly Ranchers.

1151
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:50,830
I took all the red colors and mixed it in with Sprite.

1152
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:55,270
That was, like, the most diabetes bomb possible, but it
tasted so good.

1153
01:24:58,510 --> 01:24:59,670
Yeah, no, I'm washed.

1154
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:04,150
30 seconds before you attack.

1155
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:05,930
I already won my voice.

1156
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:07,370
You guys gotta help me win my game.

1157
01:25:08,450 --> 01:25:10,530

Yeah, like that.

1166
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,360
He has a Lord icon.

1167
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:25,460
I did not really.

1168
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,980
How the fuck did he farm that?

1169
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,040
Played Hytale.

1170
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:39,320
I mean, you played that, or no?

1171
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:42,620
Okay, I don't think we should be on Penny.

1172
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:43,700
I will say that.

1173
01:26:49,090 --> 01:26:51,650
Buddy, bro, you're selling my game.

1174
01:26:52,330 --> 01:26:53,470
Oh, no, no.

1175
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:55,370
He's not the all-kid.

1176
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:58,210
He's not...

1177
01:26:58,730 --> 01:27:01,430
He's not the only one selling.

1178
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,010
I can tell.

1179
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:05,490
Don't worry.

1180
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:09,030
Bro, I...

1181
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:11,130
You're flying and like...

1182
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:12,230
Are you dying off cooldown?

1183
01:27:12,910 --> 01:27:14,210
It's fun when you die again.

1184
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:15,770
How's that fun?

1185
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:19,990
Alright, I'm gonna...

1186
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:20,490
Alright.

1187
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:23,710
Hey!

1188
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:27,130
Again!

1189
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:29,550
We need some matches?

1190
01:27:30,730 --> 01:27:30,910
Okay.

1191
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:33,910
That is unfortunate.

1192
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:40,780
Oh, it's fine.

1193
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:47,260
Hey guys, there is...

1194
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:48,600
I am just gonna...

1195
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:48,800
Okay.

1196
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:52,480
There is no way you're complaining about that.

1197
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,160
All right, that spider-man's gonna fuck us up.

1198
01:27:56,460 --> 01:28:00,640
Okay, that spider-man's gonna fuck us up.

1199
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:03,260
Okay.

1200
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,840
All right.

1201
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,480
I always...

1202
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:12,980
It's tab.

1203
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:13,780
I don't know.

1204
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,080
He literally goes into that.

1205
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:16,780
This is the only way he'll ever get healed.

1206
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:18,180
Oh my god, I get his name.

1207
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:20,840
He's the guy that drives by, so then just dies.

1208
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,460
Bro, this is the only way he'll ever get healed.

1209
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:26,260
Like, right here.

1210
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:27,440
It's time.

1211
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,140
This is literally the only way this guy will ever get
healed.

1212
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:37,230
And even then, he's going to find a way to die.

1213
01:28:41,050 --> 01:28:43,550
All I'm saying is you have this.

1214
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:48,650
Oh, that is unlucky for me.

1215
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:50,770
Oh, my God.

1216
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:52,870
I need...

1217
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:53,870
Oh, hey, hey, it's fine.

1218
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:56,350
Spider-Man, there's no way.

1219
01:28:56,590 --> 01:28:59,770
There is no way you're complaining about not getting healed.

1220
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:01,830
I saw what happened.

1221
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:04,490
I...

1222
01:29:04,490 --> 01:29:07,390
There is no way.

1223
01:29:07,490 --> 01:29:09,110
I nearly saw what happened.

1224
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:11,100
Salvage the title on it.

1225
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:15,550
Oh, hey, he fucked up.

1226
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:15,990
He fucked up.

1227
01:29:16,090 --> 01:29:16,450
You're five.

1228
01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:18,990
Never probably seen a Ferrari in life.

1229
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:21,300
He's opening a portal in the...

1230
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:23,890
There we go.

1231
01:29:24,410 --> 01:29:26,490
I have to use that, but there we go.

1232
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:34,030
All right, I'm going to predict where he is.

1233
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:37,650
This is very hard.

1234
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:45,450
Oh, my God.

1235
01:29:45,570 --> 01:29:46,650
Where is my Envis?

1236
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:48,650
Oh, my God.

1237
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:50,690
I can't go.

1238
01:29:50,810 --> 01:29:51,190
Oh, my God.

1239
01:29:51,310 --> 01:29:52,150
She went that way.

1240
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:53,610
Oh, we see nine.

1241
01:29:53,970 --> 01:29:54,210
All right.

1242
01:29:54,550 --> 01:29:56,430
The current score is zero.

1243
01:29:57,070 --> 01:29:57,470
I'm lucky.

1244
01:29:59,990 --> 01:30:00,630
Yeah, like.

1245
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:01,930
There is no way.

1246
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:04,570
I even gave him a snowflake.

1247
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:11,010
Why I'll cover...

1248
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:12,250
Because it's my alt account.

1249
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:14,190
I don't play on this account very often.

1250
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:15,070
So I...

1251
01:30:15,070 --> 01:30:17,470
The last time I played on this account, Loki wasn't meta.

1252
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:20,550
So I had no reason to play Loki on this account.

1253
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:24,790
Oh, we're flowing now.

1254
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:26,630
It's time.

1255
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:30,650
Oh, it's time.

1256
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:34,930
Oh, that's Animal Crossing.

1257
01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:36,230
Let's go.

1258
01:30:38,290 --> 01:30:39,270
I don't know why.

1259
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:46,750
Like, my game's like nice volume, but randomly, like, it
seems like it's, like, really low.

1260
01:30:47,870 --> 01:30:48,410
Nice volume.

1261
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:49,770
Yeah, main grip.

1262
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:50,790
What's your E though?

1263
01:30:52,230 --> 01:30:55,930
I will say Celestial is like, all right.

1264
01:30:56,990 --> 01:30:59,110
GM is, but, like, not like.

1265
01:30:59,110 --> 01:31:03,310
No, but like, it does it on Arch Raiders, too.

1266
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:05,530
I won't say pitch, though.

1267
01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:06,750
I just say, all right.

1268
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:08,690
I don't know why.

1269
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:12,130
It's like randomly, um, like I noticed it like a few days
ago.

1270
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:12,810
I was like, hmm.

1271
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:14,150
There are, I agree.

1272
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:15,750
There are a lot of inflated players.

1273
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:17,210
Blasting my ears.

1274
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:19,110
And like, now I can barely hear.

1275
01:31:19,330 --> 01:31:21,430
You talk like you know about this game a lot.

1276
01:31:22,230 --> 01:31:24,190
We have to stop them from securing the mission area.

1277
01:31:26,570 --> 01:31:28,070
Secrets always come out.

1278
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:29,770
Oh, console.

1279
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:30,670
Okay, I get it.

1280
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:46,960
Because console is different from PC.

1281
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:52,900
No, I'm just saying it's different environment.

1282
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,300
It's like how Overwatch PC is different from console.

1283
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,560
That's all I'm saying.

1284
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:09,660
Wait, this guy's only kill was my kill.

1285
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:11,360
I forgot my kill, Cole.

1286
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,640
I think he is the world record for...

1287
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:21,200
I'm saying console is different from PC.

1288
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:22,780
It's a different...

1289
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:24,640
Yeah, but PC has all the pro players.

1290
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:26,100
It's good for avoiding this guy off cooldown.

1291
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:33,410
But we do have controller players on PC.

1292
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:34,730
So it's a lot...

1293
01:32:34,730 --> 01:32:41,830
And then PC top pro players also are hog up 50% of the top
500.

1294
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:51,790
I will say PC top players hog up the pro players have 50% of
the top 500 leaderboards.

1295
01:32:51,890 --> 01:33:02,810
With five of their alt accounts So like So they're facing So
like you barely face like Other That's why it's so hard to

1296
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:12,350
find games in top 500 The reason why PC top 500 is low Is
because the pro players have like 50% of the leaderboards So

1297
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:20,810
like you can't find the players in the top 500 lobby Because
they have longer queues Because they are 50% of the

1298
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:30,470
leaderboards yeah that's why their cues are so fucking long

1299
01:33:33,970 --> 01:33:43,310
how do they play they wait like 10 plus minute cues
sometimes 30 minutes i've seen pro players wait like 30

1300
01:33:43,310 --> 01:33:51,030
minute cues for one game i think it would be higher if like
i think it would be higher if they have players to play

1301
01:33:51,030 --> 01:34:06,950
against literally the top 10 is like one person in our
fucking npc exactly so you can't really say that console has

1302
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:16,610
higher top 500 to like be like oh skill wise because the
reason why pc is so low is because it's hogged but they they

1303
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:18,450
had their queues are so fucking long.

1304
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:20,830
So they can't really climb.

1305
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:36,560
It's also a Gamba.

1306
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:42,980
It is also a Gamba between Will your team have the pro
players in Eternity or not.

1307
01:35:08,650 --> 01:35:09,110
Penny?

1308
01:35:09,930 --> 01:35:11,230
That's interesting.

1309
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:14,070
GM is so interesting.

1310
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:21,630
It's like, oh yeah, it's like, I swear, I see the craziest
bands in this, you know,

1311
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:34,220
of course I acknowledge, like, like, pro players complain
about queues all the time, but it's literally because, um,

1312
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:44,200
the fact that, like, half the leaderboard is them, so it's
harder to matchmake because they're literally, they're,

1313
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,880
they're literally playing against each other, like,
themselves.

1314
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:54,900
Because they're like, we need to find another Eternity 200
player to balance up the match.

1315
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:58,460
But then the Eternity 200 player is them.

1316
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:03,940
They are the Eternity 200 player.

1317
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:10,870
So now they have to find Eternity 200 players to balance it
out.

1318
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:35,400
Yeah, like when the only person who's around your level
that's queuing at the same time is you, what the fuck do you

1319
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:35,620
do?

1320
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:37,160
Good luck, 30 minute queue.

1321
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:41,880
Yeah, I'll wait until someone else pops up.

1322
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:50,340
This is also why I like got bored of queuing high Elo.

1323
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,780
It's because the wait time was so bad.

1324
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:58,540
You guys remember D-Gen hours during D-Gen queues when we're
just like queuing on the higher Elo accounts?

1325
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:01,240
And then we have to wait like 10 to 15 minutes.

1326
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:04,120
And then I was just like I'm I'm bored.

1327
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,380
I'm so bored.

1328
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:16,300
I had to play and like In like the lower you know, so at
least I can have games Yeah, and then we get on Roblox and

1329
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:23,380
then we had to we got on Roblox because we were just like We
were on Roblox in between queues.

1330
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:24,600
Yeah

1331
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:40,840
Bro, oh my god, okay I am very mispositioned by the way, but
it's fine.

1332
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:42,480
I have TP.

1333
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:45,440
I need reload though.

1334
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:50,940
Okay, that's cool.

1335
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,720
No, I just don't play as often anymore.

1336
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:04,640
I don't, like, I'm still on my main account, but I don't
play as often.

1337
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:08,320
Disappear!

1338
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:18,300
also because i'm busy i'm also oh i forgot to do the
confirmation again i keep forgetting when i'm playing

1339
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:27,940

1340
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:32,380

a rogue i'm lucky

1341
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:44,300
are you fucking kidding me oh my god it's fine we didn't
need it so it's not like i wasted it i i like that up it's

1342
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:54,760

1344
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:12,200
was just aura at this point I'm not putting another colon
out.

1345
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,840
I can't put another colon out.

1346
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:15,480
That's the worst part.

1347
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:17,820
Okay, I can now.

1348
01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:20,640
Where's her?

1349
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:21,320
Invis.

1350
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:23,420
Oh, that's unlucky.

1351
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:24,940
I have this.

1352
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:26,320
Oh, I'm an ace, though.

1353
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:28,260
I'm ace.

1354
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:32,640
Yeah, I know about that, bro.

1355
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,620
I'll keep up to date with Ravus.

1356
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:36,840
What did I miss?

1357
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:41,380
Deadpool is really hard to play for support.

1358
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:42,960
It's gonna take a lot.

1359
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:45,220
It's gonna take people a long time to figure out how to
play.

1360
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:47,500
Like, especially support.

1361
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:49,800
I think support for him is the most difficult role.

1362
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:53,320
Because, like, he's like a melee.

1363
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:57,620
Like, you have to melee to, like, actually...

1364
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,720
Please, I hope to grab you up.

1365
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:01,760
This is the help.

1366
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,120
Okay, like, it's fine.

1367
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:06,860
Okay, now what is this?

1368
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:10,600
Alright.

1369
01:40:16,490 --> 01:40:19,550
There's nothing I can do if he puts me up in the air.

1370
01:40:21,530 --> 01:40:22,050
Like,

1371
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:27,810
like, I, guys.

1372
01:40:28,650 --> 01:40:32,350
I was in the air for, like, 10 seconds.

1373
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:37,350
So, like, it would have been nice to get killed during that
time, I guess.

1374
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:40,950
Oh my god.

1375
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:42,650
Okay.

1376
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:44,450
That double.

1377
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:49,250
There you go.

1378
01:40:49,650 --> 01:40:51,110
Oh hey, the double support ult.

1379
01:40:51,230 --> 01:40:52,010
I'm fine with that.

1380
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:54,350
I'm fine with that.

1381
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:02,520
There we go.

1382
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:05,460
Just in case.

1383
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:09,440
Hey guys!

1384
01:41:09,620 --> 01:41:10,520
Okay, there we go.

1385
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:12,740
That's it.

1386
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:16,140
Hey guys.

1387
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,380
Hey guys, there we go.

1388
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,780
Alright, nice.

1389
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:31,130
Bullets here?

1390
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:32,610
Yeah, but you have to be able to...

1391
01:41:32,610 --> 01:41:33,130
It's just...

1392
01:41:33,130 --> 01:41:34,530
You have to be able to balance between...

1393
01:41:34,530 --> 01:41:36,370
Someone that did the early access pre-built.

1394
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:41,390
You have to be able to balance between the swords and...

1395
01:41:41,390 --> 01:41:42,290
Like, and the...

1396
01:41:43,890 --> 01:41:45,950
The swords and the bullets, too.

1397
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:55,250

01:43:54,330 --> 01:43:57,190
There is no way you're going outside.

01:43:57,830 --> 01:43:57,830
Okay

1411
01:44:02,230 --> 01:44:02,790

I'm fine with that.

1413
01:44:08,190 --> 01:44:09,290
I am not fine with that.

1414
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:17,130
Jesus, already again?

1415
01:44:19,490 --> 01:44:20,250
There's nothing.

1416
01:44:20,370 --> 01:44:21,050
I didn't have shift.

1417
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:29,140
Oh, pot.

01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:31,760
Okay, I will say.

1419
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:33,380
Our rogue?

1420
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:37,880
I will, okay, no, actually, our mag.

1421
01:44:42,180 --> 01:44:44,880
Might be our mag, actually.

1422
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:49,180
It's either a mag or a rogue.

1423
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:49,960
Yeah.

1424
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:50,780
That's fine.

1425
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:54,180
Oh, we rock it.

1426
01:44:55,020 --> 01:45:00,180
I'm not dealing with, I'm not dealing with the Spider-Man.

1427
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:04,360
I'm gonna let my, I'm gonna let my invis handle the
Spider-Man.

1428
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:07,860
Oh, we're going triple support.

1429
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:10,180
I mean, that also works.

1430
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:11,280
You know what?

1431
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:12,400
That also works.

1432
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:13,200
Fuck it.

1433
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:14,200
Let's go.

1434
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:17,800
Now, our tanks are doo-doo.

1435
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:19,280
That's fine.

1436
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:21,020
It's fine.

1437
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:23,320
The thing is, that's their mains.

1438
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:25,760
I'm just vibing.

1439
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:28,740
The Elo terrorist is here to vibe.

1440
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:31,460
Like, fuck it, we ball.

1441
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:33,640
Fuck it.

1442
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:35,460
What?

1443
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:37,360
Happens, happens.

1444
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:40,120
See ya.

1445
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,880
I'm on an altar cat.

1446
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:44,360
I'm still playing my best.

1447
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:45,560
Well, technically.

1448
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:51,780
I mean, I had a yellow brick road, okay?

1449
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:54,120
I did have a yellow brick road.

1450
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:58,500
The cat rage bait me.

1451
01:45:58,680 --> 01:45:59,420
I'm immune.

1452
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:00,740
I'm not dokey, babe.

1453
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:11,110
Cat rage bait me.

1454
01:46:11,230 --> 01:46:12,370
I'm not dokey, babe.

1455
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:19,120
It's okay, we're taking care of each other.

1456
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:26,380
Alright.

1457
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:28,700
Oh my god, that guy is so low.

1458
01:46:28,780 --> 01:46:30,540
Oh my god, it's because he sucked him up.

1459
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:32,800
I was like, what the fuck?

1460
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,660
I need to keep this for like...

1461
01:46:40,780 --> 01:46:42,120
Oh, he was so low.

1462
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:44,580
I'll give him here.

1463
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:47,160
I need to keep a lead for the spot, man.

1464
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,280
Whenever he decides to show up.

1465
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:54,400
Oh, wait, is that a...

1466
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:55,380
Oh, he stopped.

1467
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:55,880
All right.

1468
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:56,880
What the fuck?

1469
01:46:58,140 --> 01:46:59,240
The one time.

1470
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,320
Okay, then I don't have to keep my leaves.

1471
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:04,980
I leave.

1472
01:47:10,330 --> 01:47:10,690
Jesus.

1473
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:11,810
Oh, my God.

1474
01:47:11,870 --> 01:47:12,130
I got stuck.

1475
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:12,730
I got stuck.

1476
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:13,530
Oh, fuck.

1477
01:47:13,610 --> 01:47:14,350
That was on me.

1478
01:47:14,870 --> 01:47:15,530
I got stuck.

1479
01:47:17,370 --> 01:47:18,330
Oh, my God.

1480
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:20,790
And look, it's okay.

1481
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:22,250
We have our fourth healer.

1482
01:47:22,690 --> 01:47:23,350
The Groot!

1483
01:47:24,130 --> 01:47:25,290
The Groot!

1484
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:25,790
Yes!

1485
01:47:26,330 --> 01:47:27,110
The Groot!

1486
01:47:27,530 --> 01:47:28,770
Our four-peeler!

1487
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:32,710
What can they do?

1488
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:34,950
We technically are quad support!

1489
01:47:38,330 --> 01:47:39,730
Goar, stop!

1490
01:47:42,490 --> 01:47:43,170
You know what?

1491
01:47:43,310 --> 01:47:43,910
Fuck this.

1492
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:45,230
Let's go.

1493
01:47:49,210 --> 01:47:49,330
Yeah!

1494
01:47:50,190 --> 01:47:50,970
Let's go!

1495
01:47:51,830 --> 01:47:53,550
Damage boosts everything!

1496
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:58,150
The secret fourth healer.

1497
01:47:59,570 --> 01:48:00,690
The secret weapon.

1498
01:48:01,510 --> 01:48:03,250
What can they do about that?

1499
01:48:05,290 --> 01:48:05,750
One.

1500
01:48:06,490 --> 01:48:07,810
I might be dead.

1501
01:48:10,630 --> 01:48:12,030
But we still have another.

1502
01:48:12,890 --> 01:48:14,630
He will heal for me.

1503
01:48:15,670 --> 01:48:15,950
Oh,

1504
01:48:19,670 --> 01:48:20,250
that's unlucky.

1505
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:21,790
Oh, that's fine.

1506
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:26,230
There you go.

1507
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:28,850
If all else fails, go triple support.

1508
01:48:29,890 --> 01:48:32,070
That's like the key.

1509
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:38,160
All right.

1510
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:44,840
As always, if all else fails, we still have triple support.

1511
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:49,340
And our fourth secret healer.

1512
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:54,060
All right, I'm not.

1513
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:56,580
Oh my god, our rogue.

1514
01:48:58,140 --> 01:49:00,140
What the fuck did he fucking...

1515
01:49:00,140 --> 01:49:02,520
Oh my god, that was scared.

1516
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:06,840
I'm trying to like make sure I don't waste much.

1517
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:13,340
All right, well, I hope people are alive.

1518
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:16,080
Oh, fuck wait, they're not.

1519
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:18,020
What do we do?

1520
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:20,880
Our only DPS is me and Rogue.

1521
01:49:25,780 --> 01:49:27,100
Go Rogue, go!

1522
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:36,720
Oh my god, I'm so sad.

1523
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:40,900
Wait, wait, wait, keep me up, keep me up, keep me up!

1524
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:41,080
No!

1525
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:45,080
Oh, I couldn't do anything.

1526
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:48,800
I literally needed one more H, one more.

1527
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:53,520
Oh my god, bro, I saved your life!

1528
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:56,820
I saved my Invis life!

1529
01:49:57,220 --> 01:49:59,100
Where was my plus one?

1530
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:00,620
It's okay, our secret fourth healer.

1531
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:03,380
Our secret fourth healer is coming in clutch.

1532
01:50:10,290 --> 01:50:11,470
Go, go, go!

1533
01:50:11,650 --> 01:50:12,510
Go, go!

1534
01:50:15,210 --> 01:50:16,570
Oh my gosh, she disappeared.

1535
01:50:17,070 --> 01:50:18,370
You're not disappearing from me.

1536
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:20,690
Oh my god.

1537
01:50:21,690 --> 01:50:24,390
That's okay, me and the Star Lord, we chillin'.

1538
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:26,290
We have four healers in the backlight.

1539
01:50:30,130 --> 01:50:32,830
Oh my god, but we also have...

1540
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:33,490
There we go.

1541
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:35,970
What the fuck?

1542
01:50:36,270 --> 01:50:39,930
Like, look at that!

1543
01:50:40,330 --> 01:50:41,070
We did it.

1544
01:50:43,210 --> 01:50:44,850
What the fuck?

1545
01:50:46,330 --> 01:50:47,410
Technically, four support.

1546
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:52,710
The tree.

1547
01:50:52,950 --> 01:50:54,830
The tree can heal this.

1548
01:50:55,730 --> 01:50:56,650
I told you.

1549
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,100
Quad support.

1550
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:04,400
Win and doubt.

1551
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:07,480
Exactly.

1552
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:09,940
Just out heal all the damage, forehead.

01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:11,240

01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:19,920
tournament.

1556
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:22,940
I'm in the 200k tournament.

1557
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:28,060
Yeah,

1558
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:31,620

1559
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:33,000
We don't need no mag.

1560
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,540
We need a fourth healer.

1561
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:47,640
Oh, it's at 12 p.m.

01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:51,500

01:52:41,310 --> 01:52:45,050
Papa, I'm here.

1570
01:52:45,510 --> 01:52:45,970
No!

1571
01:52:47,190 --> 01:52:47,570
No!

1572
01:52:55,110 --> 01:52:57,990
What of you?

1573
01:52:59,330 --> 01:53:01,410
Father, I have returned.

1574
01:53:03,470 --> 01:53:04,390
No!

1575
01:53:04,990 --> 01:53:08,030
They took my papa away from me.

1576
01:53:09,150 --> 01:53:10,230
And I played them bit.

1577
01:53:10,810 --> 01:53:11,170
I'll go.

1578
01:54:09,110 --> 01:54:11,310
Never get Gambit.

1579
01:54:12,050 --> 01:54:12,870
It's not fair.

1580
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:14,250
You know what's crazy?

1581
01:54:14,650 --> 01:54:15,250
Offstream?

1582
01:54:15,970 --> 01:54:19,270
Offstream, I had both games.

1583
01:54:19,550 --> 01:54:21,150
They didn't ban Gambit.

1584
01:54:21,690 --> 01:54:22,630
It's not fair.

1585
01:54:23,810 --> 01:54:28,550
How come they didn't ban Gambit when I get to play Gambit?

1586
01:54:32,630 --> 01:54:35,110
I just won one Gambit game.

1587
01:54:35,890 --> 01:54:39,370
I'm about to show you guys what the rocket's for.

1588
01:54:39,810 --> 01:54:40,950
Oh, that is in this tab.

1589
01:54:42,030 --> 01:54:43,150
He's not healing.

1590
01:54:43,970 --> 01:54:44,870
He is not healing.

1591
01:54:45,710 --> 01:54:47,130
I'm solo healing this.

1592
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:53,670
Actually, I'm taking the cough drop.

1593
01:54:53,850 --> 01:54:54,650
I'm risking it.

1594
01:54:55,450 --> 01:54:57,030
I'm risking it for the biscuit.

1595
01:55:00,450 --> 01:55:01,010
Alright.

1596
01:55:03,190 --> 01:55:05,750
I don't trust not Doki Bird because they don't know.

1597
01:55:05,890 --> 01:55:07,390
if I'm Doki Brood or not.

1598
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:16,380
Wee.

1599
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:22,220
Uh, tying all over on Rocket means he's not going to be
healing.

1600
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:24,980
He's going to be shooting his gun.

1601
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:32,260
The battle starts in five, four, three, two, one.

1602
01:55:32,380 --> 01:55:33,900
There is a limit to cough drops.

1603
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:39,360
Well, you're not supposed to, we're not supposed Alright.

1604
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:42,220
Jesus Christ.

1605
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:43,200
He almost died.

1606
01:55:43,580 --> 01:55:44,740
Oh my god.

1607
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:48,980
I stay here because there is a...

1608
01:55:52,910 --> 01:55:53,950
What the fuck?

1609
01:55:57,980 --> 01:55:59,680
Okay, I'm a little worried, right?

1610
01:56:01,780 --> 01:56:02,520
There you go.

1611
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:08,480
Oh my god, this fucking Spider-Man is very annoying, though.

1612
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:09,540
I will have to sit.

1613
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:11,260
Get him out of here!

1614
01:56:11,380 --> 01:56:12,120
Get him out of here!

1615
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:15,200
Jesus Christ!

1616
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:21,720
Okay, this Spider-Man should not be that annoying.

1617
01:56:27,030 --> 01:56:27,610
But...

1618
01:56:27,610 --> 01:56:30,470
Like, the fact that our rocket is...

1619
01:56:33,170 --> 01:56:34,230
Oh my god.

1620
01:56:34,990 --> 01:56:37,130
Oh my god, I am a lot.

1621
01:56:38,250 --> 01:56:39,950
Okay, I'm gonna... you go first.

1622
01:56:40,490 --> 01:56:40,910
There you go.

1623
01:56:41,850 --> 01:56:44,230
Oh, that was... that's an early born again.

1624
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:49,200
All right.

1625
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:50,960
We still have all, right?

1626
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:53,760
We still...

1627
01:56:54,460 --> 01:56:58,580
Guys, um, I don't like that you guys are all...

1628
01:56:59,200 --> 01:56:59,880
Oh yeah.

1629
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:03,060
I could have kept it, but like...

1630
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:05,200
I was not risking it.

1631
01:57:05,580 --> 01:57:07,080
I did not believe in my team.

1632
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:09,580
Not in this elo.

1633
01:57:10,220 --> 01:57:11,540
Not in this elo.

1634
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:13,620
Oh, they have three supports.

1635
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:14,580
Yeah, no, we're fucked.

1636
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:15,640
We don't have a support up.

1637
01:57:21,980 --> 01:57:24,000
What's the reason for it?

1638
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:29,060
The reason is that there's one hour left of the rank.

1639
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:30,920
I fucking knew it.

1640
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:32,240
I fucking knew it.

1641
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:34,280
I was like...

1642
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:34,460
Oh!

1643
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:36,340
I didn't.

1644
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:44,540
I was like, we don't have supportals, so like, good luck to
us, I guess.

1645
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:47,940
Oh, there's the other supportals.

1646
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:49,540
Bye.

1647
01:57:52,780 --> 01:57:54,960
I didn't have my shield, unfortunately.

1648
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:58,440
I was, like, spamming that shit.

1649
01:58:02,690 --> 01:58:03,850
Yeah, I'm gatekeeping the...

1650
01:58:03,850 --> 01:58:04,690
Not last...

1651
01:58:04,690 --> 01:58:06,230
The gatekeeping the...

1652
01:58:06,230 --> 01:58:08,850
The people were trying to get to Celestia.

1653
01:58:11,790 --> 01:58:14,970
If I had a Celestia account, I would gatekeep eternity, too.

1654
01:58:15,590 --> 01:58:16,950
But unfortunately, I do not.

1655
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:19,250
I know.

1656
01:58:19,450 --> 01:58:22,190
It really is very unfortunate that I can't...

1657
01:58:24,190 --> 01:58:37,210
potential you know I wish I could I would love to Elo
terrorize to my full potential okay

1658
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:55,000
like we yeah I was gonna say we gotta get this guy oh my god
oh that's unlucky I didn't see it oh he is oh my god it's

1659
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:04,180
red Ferrari it's his this God, I think if Tyler Lover was on
DPS and shut down the Spider-Man easily.

1660
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:08,240
I would love to.

1661
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:09,400
There you go.

1662
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:15,760
Oh my god, you guys were so low.

1663
01:59:15,940 --> 01:59:16,940
I was, did not trust you.

1664
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:20,480
I have to use that.

1665
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:21,900
I hate that I have to use that.

1666
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:24,140
Because now we don't have a support up.

1667
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:26,240
But I think we would have lost if I did not.

1668
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:27,580
They were like critical.

1669
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:32,120
There you go.

1670
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:34,900
I pushed them.

1671
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:36,840
What?

1672
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:44,700
It's alright.

1673
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:47,340
Oh, it is not okay.

1674
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:50,900
Oh, that is- we are not okay now.

1675
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:52,580
Now we're not okay.

1676
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:56,520
Oh, we are absolutely not okay now.

1677
01:59:57,140 --> 01:59:58,360
I've got them!

1678
02:00:05,510 --> 02:00:06,590
Oh, no more shield.

1679
02:00:06,610 --> 02:00:07,090
shields.

1680
02:00:07,570 --> 02:00:08,970
Let's hope that doesn't fuck me over.

1681
02:00:10,830 --> 02:00:13,650
I think it's because we also do not have, unfortunately, do
not.

1682
02:00:19,970 --> 02:00:20,250
Okay.

1683
02:00:23,820 --> 02:00:25,100
He missed.

1684
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:27,540
Man.

1685
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:29,440
Only shit.

1686
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:34,940
Surely he doesn't hit me with that.

1687
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:36,100
Yeah.

1688
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:41,940
Oh my God, throwing him out of here.

1689
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:45,600
I am Asgard's might Okay, let's...

1690
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:46,880
Is he Asgard mighting?

1691
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:47,900
Is he...

1692
02:00:47,900 --> 02:00:49,000
Is he doing it, though?

1693
02:00:53,060 --> 02:00:53,680
That's fine.

1694
02:00:55,240 --> 02:00:56,720
He has Asgard mighted.

1695
02:00:57,820 --> 02:00:58,680
Feeling fantastic.

1696
02:00:59,020 --> 02:00:59,340
Safe.

1697
02:01:03,720 --> 02:01:04,520
Oh, well.

1698
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:06,720
That's fine.

1699
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:08,420
That's no longer fine.

1700
02:01:08,420 --> 02:01:08,820
That's fine.

1701
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:09,820
Thanks for the boost.

1702
02:01:10,820 --> 02:01:11,560
Feel the pull.

1703
02:01:12,220 --> 02:01:12,780
Oh, well.

1704
02:01:12,940 --> 02:01:13,520
Are you willing to help?

1705
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:17,720
Oh.

1706
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:19,580
Oh.

1707
02:01:20,020 --> 02:01:22,500
The Spider-Man has all, I'll repeat.

1708
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:25,520
The Spider-Man has all.

1709
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:31,520
Oh, I put the shield.

1710
02:01:31,820 --> 02:01:32,520
I put the shield.

1711
02:01:34,620 --> 02:01:36,220
I did my job.

1712
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:42,330
Oh my god.

1713
02:01:45,550 --> 02:01:46,930
I'm just going to use this on myself.

1714
02:01:49,310 --> 02:01:50,810
Oh, he is so dead.

1715
02:01:58,840 --> 02:01:59,160
Oh, my God.

1716
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:01,120
I had that so unlucky.

1717
02:02:06,150 --> 02:02:06,710
All right.

1718
02:02:07,670 --> 02:02:09,070
A fucking curse.

1719
02:02:11,110 --> 02:02:11,990
Jesus Christ.

1720
02:02:12,670 --> 02:02:13,470
Please, he's so close.

1721
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:14,890
Lord, you have to touch.

1722
02:02:17,530 --> 02:02:19,130
You have to touch.

1723
02:02:19,950 --> 02:02:20,170
No!

1724
02:02:24,780 --> 02:02:25,860
Where is it?

1725
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:29,080
It's okay.

1726
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:29,920
Watch this.

1727
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:35,320

unfortunate

1729
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:14,800
That truly was Very unfortunate that that happened but truly

1730
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:29,300
misfortune The worst part is that I got rid of my okay, we
can push this up now Okay, we should kill this guy right

1731
02:03:29,300 --> 02:03:35,770
there we go What the fuck

1732
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:41,980
Okay.

1733
02:03:42,760 --> 02:03:44,560
The Spider-Man doesn't know I'm here.

1734
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:48,100
He doesn't know.

1735
02:03:48,180 --> 02:03:49,380
I fucking search.

1736
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:51,000
Oh my god.

1737
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:52,360
He doesn't know I'm right here.

1738
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:54,260
I'm in my little puppy hug.

1739
02:03:58,240 --> 02:03:59,300
Okay, this is bad.

1740
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:06,620
Oh, there we go.

1741
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:09,060
Go it!

1742
02:04:11,300 --> 02:04:11,820
Nice.

1743
02:04:14,140 --> 02:04:15,020
Okay, now I go.

1744
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:15,420
well.

1745
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:21,760
Okay, this is when you cannot.

1746
02:04:23,980 --> 02:04:24,580
There we go.

1747
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,220
Okay, I have, I don't have push.

1748
02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:31,960
Let's go.

1749
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:34,780
The current score is zero.

1750
02:04:34,820 --> 02:04:35,960
The power of the DPS rock.

1751
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:41,880
Time to switch things up, including which side.

1752
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:42,720
Let's go.

1753
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:46,360
I can't believe we see none that.

1754
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:50,680
I was like, That was not the thing you're supposed to watch,
by the way.

1755
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:53,100
That...

1756
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:56,870
I said watch this, but the C9 was not it.

1757
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:03,500
Swear to God, it was not the C9.

1758
02:05:11,900 --> 02:05:13,620
But it was fun.

1759
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,300
But Tokyo was pretty funny.

1760
02:05:17,140 --> 02:05:19,140
It was, though.

1761
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:20,460
I will admit.

1762
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:28,240
It was pretty funny.

1763
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:34,980
Wee.

1764
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:43,060
I think my favorite part about the little accessories is
like Jeff Bunny and Deadpool's ash.

1765
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:46,260
They know what they're doing.

1766
02:05:51,740 --> 02:05:52,820
Oh my god, gay.

1767
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:09,040
I'm okay.

1768
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:11,420
I don't know about it.

1769
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:13,160
He's okay too, I guess.

1770
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:15,620
Oh my god, I can't believe.

1771
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:16,880
I mistimed that.

1772
02:06:17,260 --> 02:06:18,320
I snapped too far.

1773
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:23,180
That was not intentional.

1774
02:06:26,140 --> 02:06:26,400
Alright.

1775
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:27,220
That's fine.

1776
02:06:27,460 --> 02:06:27,980
That's fine.

1777
02:06:30,460 --> 02:06:31,200
I still care.

1778
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:32,800
Or is I thorough care?

1779
02:06:32,920 --> 02:06:34,420
I'm okay, but there's our Thor.

1780
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:35,400
Oh, our Thor is okay.

1781
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:37,780
I need my shield, though.

1782
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:40,060
But I already almost have.

1783
02:06:40,240 --> 02:06:40,760
Oh, what the fuck?

1784
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:41,400
That's crazy.

1785
02:06:41,740 --> 02:06:42,100
Okay.

1786
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:43,360
Hey, guys.

1787
02:06:43,940 --> 02:06:44,280
Thank you.

1788
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:46,520
Oh, my God.

1789
02:06:46,660 --> 02:06:47,920
Not for our group, though.

1790
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:49,620
Our group.

1791
02:06:49,820 --> 02:06:50,400
Oh, our group's back.

1792
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:51,060
That's fine.

1793
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:52,740
Our group is back, though.

1794
02:06:52,780 --> 02:06:54,060
Oh, not our star lord, though.

1795
02:06:55,100 --> 02:06:57,080
Okay, I could do an aggressive out here.

1796
02:06:57,720 --> 02:06:58,140
I believe.

1797
02:06:58,280 --> 02:06:58,780
Do you believe?

1798
02:06:58,940 --> 02:06:59,400
I believe.

1799
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:02,560

02:07:39,860 --> 02:07:41,840
Guys, what about the scooter man, though?

1805
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:43,800
What about the scooter?

1806
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:44,120
Guys!

1807
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,340
Guys, there's still a scooter man, though!

1808
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:50,260
There you go.

1809
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:50,780
Ha-ha!

1810
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:52,260
I got the scooter, man.

1811
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:54,520
There you go.

1812
02:07:54,740 --> 02:07:55,260
The drop team.

1813
02:07:55,660 --> 02:07:56,240
We did it.

1814
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:59,640
We got him.

1815
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:02,300
I said, what about it?

1816
02:08:02,360 --> 02:08:03,400
But little do they know?

1817
02:08:05,100 --> 02:08:06,460
I'm meant for them.

1818
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:08,800
Oh, this guy is low, low.

1819
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:09,560
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1820
02:08:11,540 --> 02:08:13,680
Bro, Invis is so fucking broken.

1821
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:18,160
Oh, little did the Spider-Man knows?

1822
02:08:20,460 --> 02:08:23,300
Little does he know our Star Lord was the one that's on
point.

1823
02:08:24,440 --> 02:08:25,240
That's right.

1824
02:08:25,340 --> 02:08:26,580
A DPS was on point.

1825
02:08:26,720 --> 02:08:27,740
You can't bully us.

1826
02:08:29,480 --> 02:08:31,040
Oh, wait, but we gotta help this guy, though.

1827
02:08:36,140 --> 02:08:37,600
I don't feel safe right now.

1828
02:08:38,380 --> 02:08:41,120
Oh, yeah, that's why I do not feel safe right now.

1829
02:08:41,420 --> 02:08:42,340
Be back up, please.

1830
02:08:42,500 --> 02:08:43,500
I do not think you're safe.

1831
02:08:44,700 --> 02:08:46,660
Nah, I fucking knew it.

1832
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:49,980
I fucking knew I didn't feel safe here.

1833
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:51,780
Oh, my God.

1834
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:53,260
Oh, that's unfortunate.

1835
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:01,780
Okay, I was trying to find my shield.

1836
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:04,120
I realized my shield was...

1837
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:05,000
Oh, my God.

1838
02:09:05,240 --> 02:09:07,060
He didn't even know where I was!

1839
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:10,360
He found me on the last second!

1840
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:13,200
Oh my god.

1841
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:14,380
This guy didn't even know.

1842
02:09:14,780 --> 02:09:17,600
He literally didn't see me until the last second, too.

1843
02:09:17,660 --> 02:09:19,060
He was like, 360.

1844
02:09:19,320 --> 02:09:19,840
Where is she?

1845
02:09:30,750 --> 02:09:32,670
We're going to press alt and I'm going to press alt.

1846
02:09:32,810 --> 02:09:33,310
We'll go here.

1847
02:09:35,170 --> 02:09:35,370
Oh.

1848
02:09:36,270 --> 02:09:37,410
Get over here.

1849
02:09:37,670 --> 02:09:38,490
That's right.

1850
02:09:38,670 --> 02:09:38,970
Go on.

1851
02:09:40,970 --> 02:09:41,490
Oh.

1852
02:09:42,210 --> 02:09:42,490
Oh.

1853
02:09:43,110 --> 02:09:46,190
That was a little embarrassing from there, Phoenix.

1854
02:09:47,290 --> 02:10:06,170
their phoenix did not realize oh there you go that was silly
though what they oh oh god where is oh i was gonna say

1856
02:10:18,950 --> 02:10:22,070
we are trying so hard to keep you up right now, Thor.

1857
02:10:22,950 --> 02:10:24,450
I swear to...

1858
02:10:25,710 --> 02:10:26,970
Okay, I don't have to ult, though.

1859
02:10:27,250 --> 02:10:27,690
At least.

1860
02:10:30,450 --> 02:10:34,150
Okay, I better not have to waste my ult here because that's
just two people.

1861
02:10:35,770 --> 02:10:37,950
Like, please kill this one guy.

1862
02:10:38,490 --> 02:10:38,950
There you go.

1863
02:10:39,830 --> 02:10:41,550
I was gonna say I was not wasting my ult.

1864
02:10:44,470 --> 02:10:47,230
Okay, I swear to God.

1865
02:10:47,530 --> 02:10:48,930
He fucking took his...

1866
02:10:48,950 --> 02:10:49,930
up forward?

1867
02:10:50,950 --> 02:10:52,210
Oh my god!

1868
02:10:52,510 --> 02:10:53,790
Who does that?

1869
02:10:54,490 --> 02:10:56,230
Oh, we got put.

1870
02:10:56,990 --> 02:10:58,890
He took his up forward.

1871
02:10:59,530 --> 02:11:00,850
Oh my god.

1872
02:11:01,090 --> 02:11:02,650
That's crazy.

1873
02:11:04,430 --> 02:11:06,950
Bro, he didn't even know I was there.

1874
02:11:07,170 --> 02:11:09,650
I didn't even know he was there because he was on high
ground.

1875
02:11:11,470 --> 02:11:11,750
Yeah.

1876
02:11:12,190 --> 02:11:18,690
I couldn't see him because he was like blocked by the
blocked by the about the height thing.

1877
02:11:19,450 --> 02:11:23,770
The other straight to me, I was like, okay, this all should
be fine.

1878
02:11:25,110 --> 02:11:26,290
This guy out of here.

1879
02:11:26,710 --> 02:11:28,650
Fucking give me pictures of Spider-Man right now.

1880
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:35,380
God, who's a fucking menace?

1881
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:40,060
God damn menace to society!

1882
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:42,960
You need to be able to rock it in the house, though.

1883
02:11:43,580 --> 02:11:43,900
Yay!

1884
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:47,560
Oh my god, he has more kills than our fucking Phoenix.

1885
02:11:47,700 --> 02:11:48,380
That is sad.

1886
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:52,280
Bro, I'm glad Uncle Ben is dead.

1887
02:11:55,620 --> 02:11:56,580
He deserves it.

1888
02:11:58,740 --> 02:11:59,500
That's right.

1889
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:01,280
That's how much...

1890
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:04,120
Jesus, 20 final blows as rocket.

1891
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:06,060
That's insane.

1892
02:12:07,180 --> 02:12:07,480
Whoa!

1893
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:12,220
You should be glad, too.

1894
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:16,400
Because without Uncle Ben dying, we won't have Spider-Man.

1895
02:12:17,540 --> 02:12:17,940
Silly?

1896
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:22,980
He gave me someone to hate.

1897
02:12:23,140 --> 02:12:24,140
Thank you, Uncle Ben.

1898
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:26,260
With your death, I have a true hate.

1899
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:28,860
Like, I can finally hate freely.

1900
02:12:33,180 --> 02:12:33,820
Silly?

1901
02:12:35,160 --> 02:12:37,380
They will never have Spider-Man.

1902
02:12:48,420 --> 02:12:49,060
Yeah.

1903
02:12:50,740 --> 02:12:55,740
It wouldn't have 200 million Spider-Man skins without Uncle
Ben.

1904
02:12:57,700 --> 02:13:12,780
Red Ferrari Bro that fucking guy Is bad at video games Very
fond that guy He literally lost a 1v1 With a rocket Like

1905
02:13:12,780 --> 02:13:19,580
seven times That's up Bro I He fucking lost a 1v1 with me

1906
02:13:25,740 --> 02:13:32,900
I feel like Interseason is just people playing Playing like
Playing like Spoodle Man.

1907
02:13:38,660 --> 02:13:39,900
Bro, he was not talking.

1908
02:13:40,520 --> 02:13:41,600
In our game, bro.

1909
02:13:41,780 --> 02:13:42,980
That guy was so shit.

1910
02:13:43,780 --> 02:13:45,500
That he got yelled at by our team.

1911
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:46,720
Then he never talked.

1912
02:13:46,820 --> 02:13:48,160
Because he's a fucking pussy.

1913
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:53,040
Um, but I don't.

1914
02:13:53,580 --> 02:13:55,220
But I don't.

1915
02:13:55,900 --> 02:13:56,300
But I don't.

1916
02:13:56,700 --> 02:13:58,540
But I'm 30 more minutes.

1917
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,720
Oh, I did not.

1918
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:11,180
avoid Red Ferrari, by the way, so I hope Titan Law avoided
him.

1919
02:14:14,060 --> 02:14:16,180
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

1920
02:14:16,300 --> 02:14:17,840
30 more minutes of gatekeep.

1921
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:20,140
Oh, I should do one game of the Deadpool.

1922
02:14:20,600 --> 02:14:25,840
Well, I won't be playing Deadpool, but I should do one game
just to see what it's like.

1923
02:14:26,900 --> 02:14:28,220
Maybe I can play Gambit now.

1924
02:14:32,020 --> 02:14:32,640
Yo, look at that.

1925
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:36,860

02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:52,560
we track our kisses instead.

1941
02:15:58,540 --> 02:15:59,980
Round one.

1942
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:06,400
Back to back to Invis.

1943
02:16:07,780 --> 02:16:08,720
Oh, that one's good.

1944
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:09,320
I like that.

1945
02:16:09,680 --> 02:16:10,260
I like that one.

1946
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:10,340
I like that one.

1947
02:16:11,660 --> 02:16:12,260
Oh, hell no.

1948
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:13,020
I'm deep guessing.

1949
02:16:14,040 --> 02:16:15,640
No, no.

1950
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:16,540
I actually don't fuck it.

1951
02:16:16,580 --> 02:16:16,840
Do it.

1952
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:17,320
Let's do it.

1953
02:16:17,540 --> 02:16:19,100
Yo, I'm playing Penny F1.

1954
02:16:20,780 --> 02:16:21,400
Oh, okay.

1955
02:16:21,480 --> 02:16:22,220
Well, I don't like on this.

1956
02:16:22,660 --> 02:16:24,900
I'm at least a little bit tolerable with what I do.

1957
02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:27,080
Got a room, Lenny.

1958
02:16:28,980 --> 02:16:30,800
Enemies to lovers right here.

1959
02:16:30,820 --> 02:16:32,700
I feel like every time I try to play that, I like fall
asleep.

1960
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:38,100
I like how they're like, we have three people who are 80%
win-right, and they don't give that one of the 80% win-right

1961
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:38,540
DPS.

1962
02:16:38,940 --> 02:16:38,960
Oh, yeah.

1963
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:39,280
Oh, yeah.

1964
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:39,460
Wait, wait, wait.

1965
02:16:39,460 --> 02:16:41,520
So, you rather play Rocket DPS with the DPS?

1966
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:41,780
Luna.

1967
02:16:42,340 --> 02:16:43,720
I love Spock having a healer.

1968
02:16:44,420 --> 02:16:44,580
Nope.

1969
02:16:44,680 --> 02:16:46,580
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

1970
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:48,220
More skillful to do on Rocket.

1971
02:16:49,220 --> 02:16:49,340
Oh.

1972
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:50,600
What a fish.

1973
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,220
They also got a penny though, so.

1974
02:16:53,440 --> 02:16:53,640
Watch.

1975
02:16:54,660 --> 02:16:57,240
All right, who's doing getting rid of the hot ground?

1976
02:17:04,390 --> 02:17:07,110
Ladies, ladies.

1977
02:17:13,150 --> 02:17:14,110
Shut up.

1978
02:17:16,510 --> 02:17:16,990
Positioning.

1979
02:17:17,010 --> 02:17:17,490
Behind them.

1980
02:17:17,770 --> 02:17:18,230
Positioning.

1981
02:17:18,230 --> 02:17:18,350
Behind them.

1982
02:17:18,350 --> 02:17:18,450
Behind them.

1983
02:17:20,300 --> 02:17:21,980
We got another one.

1984
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:27,300
But I need this for myself.

1985
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:29,020
Fuck that.

1986
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:30,580
They can't walk back.

1987
02:17:30,680 --> 02:17:31,640
If they walk back, they're fucked.

1988
02:17:38,580 --> 02:17:40,820
Okay, please kill this guy though.

1989
02:17:40,940 --> 02:17:42,040
Oh my god.

1990
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:43,460
We need more kills.

1991
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:44,080
We need more kills.

1992
02:17:44,840 --> 02:17:46,700
The fact that we did not.

1993
02:17:46,760 --> 02:17:47,780
We already have an old.

1994
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:50,820
In what world do they already have an old?

1995
02:17:52,220 --> 02:17:53,640

There we go.

2028

I like the only person.

2029
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:42,500
The only person that should be playing DPS is not playing
DPS.

2030
02:20:43,080 --> 02:20:45,200
We did not kill the Punisher.

2031
02:20:47,380 --> 02:20:49,620
We did not kill the Punisher.

2032
02:20:50,060 --> 02:20:50,600
Oh my god.

2033
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:54,920
We all just pushed forward and then forgot that there was
one more person on the team.

2034
02:20:55,800 --> 02:20:57,520
That's actually crazy.

2035
02:21:01,740 --> 02:21:03,680
That's actually crazy.

2036
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:07,240
We all just stared at the Punisher on the fucking point.

2037
02:21:11,220 --> 02:21:11,600
Donna.

2038
02:21:11,920 --> 02:21:13,280
I'm getting terrorized.

2039
02:21:13,740 --> 02:21:16,860
The ELO terrorizer has become fucking terrorized right now.

2040
02:21:16,940 --> 02:21:18,000
TV right now.

2041

is my team okay.

2043
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:34,280
That's a question that I'll keep asking.

2044
02:21:39,670 --> 02:21:39,990
Don't worry.

2045
02:21:41,030 --> 02:21:41,430
Don't worry.

2046
02:21:41,590 --> 02:21:42,670
You shall live forever.

2047
02:21:44,730 --> 02:21:45,210
Watch.

2048
02:21:46,250 --> 02:21:46,570
Never mind.

2049
02:21:46,710 --> 02:21:47,330
I don't want to do it.

2050
02:21:47,350 --> 02:21:48,050
I'm not doing it.

2051
02:21:50,450 --> 02:21:51,550

2052
02:21:51,890 --> 02:21:53,270
Oh, no, I'm not doing that.

There we go.

2054
02:21:57,510 --> 02:21:58,970
We lived, though.

2055
02:22:00,630 --> 02:22:01,650
There we go.

Oh, I don't worry

It's okay

2064
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:22,620
We can live just a little longer.

2065
02:23:22,900 --> 02:23:23,760
We can do this.

2066
02:23:24,860 --> 02:23:26,100
We can do this.

2067
02:23:26,940 --> 02:23:27,460
That's right.

2068
02:23:31,370 --> 02:23:34,130

Holding right.

2136
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:15,660

2138
02:28:18,380 --> 02:28:18,760

2139
02:28:23,380 --> 02:28:26,920
Oh my god, I hope everyone is okay.

2140
02:28:28,760 --> 02:28:29,380
How is my...

2141
02:28:29,380 --> 02:28:31,420
Okay, I noticed my...

2142
02:28:31,420 --> 02:28:33,840
Oh, just when I was about to...

2143
02:28:35,980 --> 02:28:37,780
The damage potential on this character.

2144
02:28:39,660 --> 02:28:40,700
They have no idea.

2145
02:28:42,020 --> 02:28:43,480
They don't know about the aura.

2146
02:28:43,620 --> 02:28:44,440
Oh my...

2147
02:28:44,440 --> 02:28:46,560
Okay, I gotta give myself shield real quick.

2148
02:28:50,440 --> 02:28:53,800
Oh, that is not good.

2149
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:55,860
Oh, he actually just went out of me.

2150
02:28:56,460 --> 02:28:57,320
Bro, he's throwing.

2151
02:28:57,620 --> 02:28:58,660
Oh, yeah, I'm definitely better.

2152
02:28:59,260 --> 02:29:02,600
Oh, I just got balls from CK.

2153
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:02,920
I did.

2154
02:29:03,700 --> 02:29:04,280
We're fine.

2155
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:05,360
Oh, my God.

2156
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:06,880
I don't know what happened.

2157
02:29:07,180 --> 02:29:08,020
Oh, y'all are so sexy.

2158
02:29:08,280 --> 02:29:08,780
Oh, my God.

2159
02:29:08,940 --> 02:29:09,320
Thank you, thank you.

2160
02:29:09,480 --> 02:29:11,280
Thank you, man.

2161
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:12,840
You're seeing a...

2162
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:13,220
Oh, my.

2163
02:29:13,220 --> 02:29:14,100
Look, let's go.

2164
02:29:14,440 --> 02:29:15,280
Better than Eric Armin.

2165
02:29:16,240 --> 02:29:17,000
So let's go.

2166
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:17,780
Oh, what about Crimson?

2167
02:29:18,020 --> 02:29:18,460
Hmm.

2168
02:29:18,940 --> 02:29:19,380
Hmm.

2169
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:19,900
Hmm.

2170
02:29:22,500 --> 02:29:25,020
I gotta think about that.

2171
02:29:26,740 --> 02:29:27,860
So healthy right now?

2172
02:29:28,340 --> 02:29:30,200
No, you got me playing with my hairs right now.

2173
02:29:30,380 --> 02:29:30,880
Oh yeah.

2174
02:29:34,480 --> 02:29:35,100
Oh my god.

2175
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:39,100
Okay, at least we have Rocket up, but they do have Phoenix
up though, so like I'm a little concerned.

2176
02:29:41,220 --> 02:29:41,600
Oh, it's okay.

2177
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:44,300
So he still has, he still has second life.

2178
02:29:46,620 --> 02:29:47,080
Oh my god.

2179
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:48,380
Go, go get him.

2180
02:29:48,740 --> 02:29:49,560
Okay, wait a minute.

2181
02:29:55,700 --> 02:29:56,900
Is he okay?

2182
02:29:57,680 --> 02:29:58,380
He's not okay.

2183
02:29:59,660 --> 02:30:00,880
Wait, I still have up.

2184
02:30:02,300 --> 02:30:02,640
That's fine.

2185
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:05,160
Oh, fuck no!

2186
02:30:05,720 --> 02:30:06,600
Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

2187
02:30:07,140 --> 02:30:07,980
It's okay, I got the boop.

2188
02:30:08,140 --> 02:30:08,660
I got the boop.

2189
02:30:12,440 --> 02:30:14,680
Alright, well, I don't have all of that, though.

2190
02:30:16,020 --> 02:30:19,640
Oh my god, I think I booped him into the into the spotty
mines.

2191
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:21,040
Wait, that's crazy.

2192
02:30:21,240 --> 02:30:23,380
I actually moved him into the slaty, man.

2193
02:30:23,800 --> 02:30:24,160
It might be.

2194
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:24,980
Dude, it has to be, bro.

2195
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:27,180
I'm, like, too scared to get near him now.

2196
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:30,320
Armed and dangerous!

2197
02:30:30,740 --> 02:30:32,220
Okay, but who is the arm and dangerous?

2198
02:30:33,100 --> 02:30:34,100
Okay, that's a bit.

2199
02:30:38,610 --> 02:30:39,430
Oh, yeah, I won.

2200
02:30:39,550 --> 02:30:40,190
Oh, my.

2201
02:30:40,510 --> 02:30:40,910
Easy.

2202
02:30:47,090 --> 02:30:48,850
Okay, don't let him get me, though.

2203
02:30:49,170 --> 02:30:50,210
Don't let him get...

2204
02:30:50,210 --> 02:30:52,350
Don't let the shotgun Punisher, man, get me!

Oh my, they're so healthy.

They are so healthy.

You're making me so...

2213
02:31:33,150 --> 02:31:33,890
You're making me quiver.

2214
02:31:34,230 --> 02:31:35,830
Yeah, they heal so hard.

2215
02:31:36,010 --> 02:31:39,150
The grandkids are feeling the excess residue healing from
me.

2216
02:31:39,990 --> 02:31:42,830
I am providing the free health care for my team.

2217
02:31:46,470 --> 02:31:49,230
There's Invisdiff right there.

2218
02:31:49,830 --> 02:31:52,890
Jesus fucking Invisdiff right there.

2219
02:31:53,910 --> 02:31:54,810
You guys can't see this.

2220
02:31:55,090 --> 02:31:56,490
Okay, she had not a lot of heals.

2221
02:31:56,750 --> 02:31:58,070
That's all you have to know.

2222
02:31:58,470 --> 02:31:59,650
We have enough for one more.

2223
02:32:01,090 --> 02:32:02,450
That's all you have to know.

2224
02:32:08,030 --> 02:32:08,750
That's all.

2225
02:32:11,290 --> 02:32:12,430
I told you.

2226
02:32:12,470 --> 02:32:13,610
I told you guys.

2227
02:32:13,730 --> 02:32:15,530
That is like generational healing.

2228
02:32:20,030 --> 02:32:20,850
We got to nerf her.

2229
02:32:20,990 --> 02:32:23,110
The crazy part is that she's not really that nerfed.

2230
02:32:25,030 --> 02:32:26,310
I think Gambit is...

2231
02:32:26,330 --> 02:32:27,930
Invis are still going to be meta.

2232
02:32:28,410 --> 02:32:29,810
I mean, Gambit Invis, Loki.

2233
02:32:31,730 --> 02:32:32,530
Is there actually?

2234
02:32:32,690 --> 02:32:33,990
Oh my god, eight minutes left.

2235
02:32:34,110 --> 02:32:35,570
Eight minutes left of terrorism.

2236
02:32:36,490 --> 02:32:38,250
Red Ferrari added?

2237
02:32:41,010 --> 02:32:42,750
Oh my God.

2238
02:32:43,150 --> 02:32:43,610
Wait.

2239
02:32:44,190 --> 02:32:47,050
The red Ferrari guy added me.

2240
02:32:47,590 --> 02:32:49,030
That's crazy.

2241
02:32:51,450 --> 02:32:52,890
That's insane.

2242
02:32:55,550 --> 02:32:56,270
Bro.

2243
02:32:57,630 --> 02:32:58,510
That's crazy.

2244
02:32:59,110 --> 02:33:01,970
Well, this guy is actually on an alt account, too, by the
way.

2245
02:33:02,010 --> 02:33:07,870
You guys don't see it, but, um, it's actually, it's an alt
account because it's level 37.

2246
02:33:09,790 --> 02:33:09,850
Ha!

2247
02:33:10,010 --> 02:33:14,530

02:33:30,930 --> 02:33:33,970

2256
02:34:39,190 --> 02:34:41,430
It's going to be like a turbo cancer, though.

2257
02:34:42,090 --> 02:34:42,630
That's okay.

2258
02:34:45,210 --> 02:34:46,170
There's no...

2259
02:34:46,170 --> 02:34:46,830
Wait, really?

2260
02:34:47,510 --> 02:34:48,930
Usually they do it right away.

2261
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:55,500
Ah.

2262
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:57,420
New down-down time.

2263
02:34:58,560 --> 02:35:00,820
In a pass, it wasn't like that, so I didn't...

2264
02:35:00,820 --> 02:35:01,460
I don't know.

2265
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:02,720
I didn't know that.

2266
02:35:04,100 --> 02:35:05,720
They give us downtime now?

2267
02:35:05,800 --> 02:35:07,720
What the fuck do we do during downtime?

2268
02:35:10,660 --> 02:35:11,340
Where the fuck?

2269
02:35:11,360 --> 02:35:12,080
Did they give?

2270
02:35:12,460 --> 02:35:12,720
Did they?

2271
02:35:13,060 --> 02:35:13,940
I never...

2272
02:35:13,940 --> 02:35:16,620
You guys know, you guys can tell I've never played a new
season.

2273
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:18,680
Oh,

2274
02:35:23,600 --> 02:35:23,600
shit.

2275
02:35:23,860 --> 02:35:25,300
Now we have a rocket player.

2276
02:35:29,660 --> 02:35:31,320
You are not playing DPS.

2277
02:35:32,240 --> 02:35:33,300
You are not...

2278
02:35:33,300 --> 02:35:35,200
You are not playing support.

2279
02:35:40,500 --> 02:35:41,780
Get the fuck off.

2280
02:35:42,580 --> 02:35:42,960
I know.

2281
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:44,600
That's why I'm on Luna to do DPS.

2282
02:35:50,780 --> 02:35:55,820
We're never playing with Super Gov. miss again after this
after this game

2283
02:36:07,700 --> 02:36:15,100
where but we have oh wait we're triple support never mind
you're fine i don't think we have a dps player i don't think

2284
02:36:15,100 --> 02:36:18,500
we have a dp you're right i just remembered we could play
triple support.

2285
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:20,320
I forgot.

2286
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:24,720
And he was never seen.

2287
02:36:24,880 --> 02:36:27,880
I think the other guy I think this guy is a support player.

2288
02:36:28,520 --> 02:36:31,720
I swear to God, if this guy plays support, you gotta swap
off.

2289
02:36:33,140 --> 02:36:36,200
Alright, because he played support last time I've seen this
guy.

2290
02:36:36,980 --> 02:36:37,620
Oh, no, never mind.

2291
02:36:37,860 --> 02:36:38,200
We're fine.

2292
02:36:38,440 --> 02:36:39,560
Alright, triple support time.

2293
02:36:39,860 --> 02:36:41,940
Life energy is a powerful weapon against evil.

2294
02:36:45,380 --> 02:36:46,080
What do you say?

2295
02:36:46,240 --> 02:36:46,680
Finish.

2296
02:36:48,800 --> 02:36:51,140
I did not get bad at him.

2297
02:36:54,220 --> 02:36:56,000
That is fake news.

2298
02:36:56,780 --> 02:36:58,140
That is not...

2299
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:00,540
That is not fake.

2300
02:37:00,620 --> 02:37:02,000
That is fake news.

2301
02:37:02,740 --> 02:37:04,980
I am just blackmailing him.

2302
02:37:05,240 --> 02:37:06,080
That's different.

2303
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:10,620
Being mad and blackmailing someone is two different things.

2304
02:37:10,840 --> 02:37:11,780
It's such an emotional time.

2305
02:37:12,340 --> 02:37:13,060
I like it.

2306
02:37:15,100 --> 02:37:15,980
Wait, why?

2307
02:37:16,120 --> 02:37:17,800
30 seconds before you attack.

2308
02:37:18,140 --> 02:37:20,660
I didn't say whether or not it's good or bad.

2309
02:37:20,820 --> 02:37:22,040
I didn't say whether or not it's worse.

2310
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:24,600
I'm just saying there are two different things.

2311
02:37:27,540 --> 02:37:29,720
I never implied it was better.

2312
02:37:29,900 --> 02:37:34,140
I'm just saying there is...

2313
02:37:35,440 --> 02:37:36,480
It's blackmail.

2314
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:37,980
Not mad.

2315
02:37:40,160 --> 02:37:44,500
The battle starts in 5, 4, 3, 2,

2316
02:37:55,540 --> 02:38:04,440

I'm alive.

2330
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:45,500
There we go.

2331
02:39:46,860 --> 02:39:49,360
I'm winning your 1v1 for you.

2332
02:39:51,640 --> 02:39:54,460
I'm literally winning your 1v1s.

2333
02:39:55,500 --> 02:39:57,000
What's your excuse?

2334
02:40:02,130 --> 02:40:03,790
You were running away.

2335
02:40:03,810 --> 02:40:05,970
Wait, I was winning that 1v1.

2336
02:40:06,430 --> 02:40:10,310
I got him.

2337
02:40:11,510 --> 02:40:12,190
Where is he?

2338
02:40:13,050 --> 02:40:14,250
Oh, wait, that's our hell up.

2339
02:40:15,050 --> 02:40:16,390
That's the enemy alone.

2340
02:40:19,090 --> 02:40:19,950
Here we go.

2341
02:40:20,210 --> 02:40:20,770
There we go.

2342
02:40:21,790 --> 02:40:23,170
They were both right!

2343
02:40:26,940 --> 02:40:29,140
Like, you just don't help far.

2344
02:40:29,580 --> 02:40:31,040
Are you fucking kidding?

2345
02:40:34,580 --> 02:40:35,920

2346
02:40:36,520 --> 02:40:39,440

these guys these guys are not desperate enough for Eela.

2350
02:41:12,540 --> 02:41:15,260
He wants the grid up right there.

2351
02:41:15,840 --> 02:41:17,140
He's definitely looking for it.

2352
02:41:17,800 --> 02:41:23,840
These guys are not, do not want the, uh, these guys do not
want Eela as badly as I thought they do.

2353
02:41:29,370 --> 02:41:30,150
Okay, guys!

2354
02:41:37,230 --> 02:41:38,790
That's okay, I have my own.

2355
02:41:40,570 --> 02:41:43,710
So, I did the wrong DPS healer.

2356
02:41:43,890 --> 02:41:44,490
Yeah.

2357
02:41:48,580 --> 02:41:50,740

See, look, my stats aren't bad at all.

2363
02:42:08,400 --> 02:42:10,220
I'm basically DPSing.

2364
02:42:11,260 --> 02:42:14,820

02:43:43,390 --> 02:43:44,670
Oh, I hear the wolf.

Oh, my God.

2388
02:45:06,350 --> 02:45:07,290
Is Z going to live?

2389
02:45:13,640 --> 02:45:14,680
That's crazy.

2390
02:45:14,820 --> 02:45:15,840
I'm going to watch this 1v1.

2391
02:45:17,080 --> 02:45:18,160
They're five.

2392
02:45:21,260 --> 02:45:22,080
There you go.

2393
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:27,460
You were supposed to 1v1 someone else?

2394
02:45:28,140 --> 02:45:28,560
Hello?

2395
02:45:30,480 --> 02:45:31,920
Wrong person.

2396
02:45:32,240 --> 02:45:33,900
You're lucky I let you live.

2397
02:45:35,740 --> 02:45:36,900
You're so lucky.

You're so lucky I let you live.

Wrong person.

There we go.

2404
02:46:03,480 --> 02:46:04,160
Everything's fine.

2405
02:46:04,280 --> 02:46:05,740

2412
02:46:29,360 --> 02:46:30,160
He's on the back.

02:46:33,220 --> 02:46:35,060
He's fucking solo up to you.

2414
02:46:37,300 --> 02:46:38,220
That's crazy.

2415
02:46:39,560 --> 02:46:41,520
Bro, we had an insane record to them.

2416
02:46:41,900 --> 02:46:42,880
To be fair, this GM.

guy.

It's not even a 1v1.

2422
02:47:04,520 --> 02:47:07,440
He's like literally fighting for his life right now.

2423
02:47:09,460 --> 02:47:11,200
Bro, he has to stop.

2424
02:47:15,720 --> 02:47:17,300

2425
02:47:21,220 --> 02:47:23,000
Are they still back there trying to kill him?

2427
02:47:23,940 --> 02:47:28,180
They're literally just camping him over and over again.

2428
02:47:30,460 --> 02:47:32,040
He's dead again.
