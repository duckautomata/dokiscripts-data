Yep, same format, Swiss format, but I think we got, we
definitely got matched with one of the harder team.

4
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,040
Teams are of the same record as us, judging by the ranks.

5
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,860
Oh, so I will try my best.

6
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,300

event of cake that you the super chat that you think the

21
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:51,030

22
00:02:51,030 --> 00:03:01,130
tournament if we lose one if we lose um to any teams today
so maybe yeah there's a lot of strong teams still left

23
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:10,730
including this one so um i mean judging by the ranks like
This team seems really strong.

24
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,370
Looking at ranks-wise, that's why I'm like...

25
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:13,770
Oh!

26
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:16,810
Oh!

27
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,050
Yeah, the pressure.

28
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,890
And they have two coaches.

29
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,930
Like, what the fuck?

30
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,310
Oh, my gosh.

31
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,150
I got this.

32
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,310
I'm gonna try my best to lock in.

33
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,150
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa.

34
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,310
I'm just a bundle of nerves in general.

35
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:51,830
Okay.

36
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,010
Calm down.

37
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,910
Oh, calm down.

38
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,110
I thought we'd be ready.

39
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,230
Yeah, I'm ready.

40
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,430
Everyone's here, right?

41
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,330
I'm here.

42
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,870
I'm all here.

43
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,230
Yeah, I'm here.

44
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:11,570
Okay.

45
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,710
Oh, I...

46
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,610
I'll go here.

47
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,150
In the worst case, we can pause.

48
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,370
We can pause anyway, I think.

49
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,310
I gotta put on socks.

50
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,510
Hold on.

51
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,790
That's why we didn't win against Sarah.

52
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:27,970
I have socks on.

53
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:28,490
Oh my gosh.

54
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,210
The sock.

55
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,550
Gotta wear the good stuff, you know.

56
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:33,690
Oh.

57
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:36,950
Oh, okay.

58
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:48,970
all right also today actually i had a little morning scare
um dad woke me up um with like a cry like he was getting

59
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:57,170
murdered and i was like freaking the fuck out i actually had
to take him to the like emergency this morning because i was

60
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:05,210
like i don't know what the fuck is going on um but i found
him basically he uh i bought like this like little blank

61
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:12,630
this blanket that holes in it and i didn't realize he like
got under it he got into it and he got his foot got stuck in

62
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,430
the hole he couldn't get out of the hole and he was like and
i woke up and i was just like and he was like and i heard

63
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:25,410
like like it was so scary it was like the scariest cry i've
ever heard i've never heard of make that sound before and

64
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:35,630
he's like like freaking the fuck out i was like what
happened like he literally woke me up and um and then like

65
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:43,030
he got really like basically he was like super trim like
traumatized after i got him out of the blanket um and but

66
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:49,290
all he wanted to do was just hide in like like burrow under
like the blankets and stuff like under not the whole blanket

67
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:57,470
but like the his usual blankets and um and i was freaking
out because he was like i tried to like check his like every

68
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:04,350
like check his body and everything but he was like shaking
and he was just like what the fuck like i i want to be in my

69
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:11,430
blanket and he was calling into his like his like kennel and
everything too and i took him to the vet and he was like oh

70
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:19,930
he seems to be fine right now but they're like he might have
dislocated like a finger on his back leg and then he like

71
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:26,150
relocated it back like he doesn't know you might have pulled
a muscle he could have pulled a muscle he could have

72
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:35,530
dislocated a finger or something um and just put it back but
he's like he seems fine right now yeah so they're like oh he

73
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:43,210
seems fine right now but any it could have been anything um
no it's my dog my dog i call him dad uh because his full

74
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:50,930
name is doki amber doge um and then so it's really confusing
to call him doki as well so that's it's like um it's my dog

75
00:06:50,930 --> 00:07:00,730
um and see what they burn and then um and i was freaking out
like i was i literally like took him to emergency vet i came

76
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:08,710
back just in time for screams and then i did and i went like
I went straight to here so I'm like a little tired I woke up

77
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:16,190
super early because uh I had to take him to the vet uh and
then the vet was just like he seems fine but he's just going

78
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:23,570
through some I guess he's just traumatized right now so I
was just like oh thank god okay he's just traumatized at

79
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:32,550
least you know that's the least it's so pretty bad like he's
traumatized from the incident um so but at least like it's

80
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:38,010
not it's not like anything bad i don't know if these guys
play dive or not yeah just i thought you would like sprain

81
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:47,990
his ankle or some yeah i don't think it's a little trauma
because he just wants to like he just wants to hide under he

82
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:56,370
just wants to like hide under his uh like blanket right now
he's just like huddled furled under his blanket he doesn't

83
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:05,090
want to be out of it we can say play we can play venom at
least physically he's okay so like that's why i'm like all

84
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:14,150
over the place at the moment but just a shy little guy well
not shy just to try like just a guy with trauma something

85
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:23,870
i've never heard that cry before i was it actually like it
traumatized me when i heard the cry yeah i think we should

86
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,010
phoenix yeah it's bucky phoenix Bucky Fiend, Bucky Fiend.

87
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,290
Magidot?

88
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:30,730
Yeah, Mac.

89
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,710
I do think, I don't know if it's Bucky Fiend.

90
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,990
I feel like the Wolf Phoenix is infinitely better
personally.

91
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,070
They're gonna play Hulk though.

92
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,210
Bucky's infinitely better into that, no?

93
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:40,670
Yeah.

94
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,510
You just burn the guy.

95
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:44,470
Yeah.

96
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,230
Did I play Rocket?

97
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,390
Uh, Cloak.

98
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,010
Yeah, it's probably Rocket.

99
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,930
Not straight, don't you think?

100
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,710
Uh, you can go Luna if you want, or Cloak.

101
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,050
Oh, okay.

102
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:55,710
Uh.

103
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,730
Which is best.

104
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,170
Let's see the map.

105
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:00,850
Let's see the map.

106
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,810
This map, I think.

107
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,790
Rocket is even best, actually.

108
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,410
Yeah, I think Rocket is not bad.

109
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,270
I think Rocket in general is always good.

110
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,830
Like, Rocket Inverse is like meta.

111
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,810
Kind of when the other three supports are bad, then...

112
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,750
So you're the almighty feats, eh?

113
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,730
Not really a different choice you can have.

114
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,650
I guess you could try Deadpool or Jeff.

115
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,070
I'd cat TP bomb.

116
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,310
They might try.

117
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,830
Yeah, they will definitely try that.

118
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:34,230
Right.

119
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,210
Jump hack right here.

120
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,130
I need jumpers too.

121
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,490
Can you leave the thing?

122
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:44,470
Yeah.

123
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,490
Do you have jumpers?

124
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:46,010
I have.

125
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,110
You can take it away.

126
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:48,970
Okay, let me see.

127
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,240
No TP.

128
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,900
They're playing...

129
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,440

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,300
They might push inside the room with Phoenix expected.

155
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,980

He got me!

206
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,100
The Phoenix ran after me.

207
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,880
Come to me, Krupp!

208
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,620
I can't.

209
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,040
Wolf on me!

210
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:24,900
I'll shoot.

211
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,680
Think that.

212
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,020
I will TP.

213
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,780
Yeah, wait.

214
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,780
You have to die on.

215
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,340
We got two.

216
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:33,840
I'm dead.

217
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,660
No lamps.

218
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,260
No lamps.

219
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,340
They're down two.

220
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,160
Should have time for TP.

221
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,680
They have no lamps.

222
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,420
I'm going to take them out really fast.

223
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,240
I'm boosted.

224
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,480
I'm boosted.

225
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,700
I can't do anything about that though.

226
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,860
I can't play into wolf crook.

227
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,820
It's useless.

228
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,960
I swear I can't do anything.

229
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,220
It should be free though, but we can stay this, but we need
to just shoot them more, I think.

230
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,260
They shouldn't have that good resources.

231
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,300
All right.

232
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:08,120
what can i do against the phoenix he's been in a hard boat
chasing me everywhere yeah yeah you have to avoid them like

233
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,340
when you know he's flanking you just have to walk behind the
corner so he doesn't see you the next best thing you can do

234
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:22,260
the best thing you can do is just listen to the footsteps if
you're here you need to hide yeah i'm just trying to get on

235
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:30,300
i can't go anything as well all i want is a little peace
yeah just play this uh I guess we can play this again.

236
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,080
Let's see.

237
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,040
Did I try Emma?

238
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,560
Yeah, I try Emma.

239
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,220
Go Emma.

240
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:38,840
Go Emma.

241
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,060
Emma's fine.

242
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Be careful though.

243
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,040
Maybe you can grab the enemy wolf.

244
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,400
We just need to put more pressure on him.

245
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,540
Yeah, okay, okay.

246
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,940
Are we going to play?

247
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,500
Yeah, they're likely to do it by the way.

248
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,740
No, go main, go main, go main, go main.

249
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,180
Okay, okay.

250
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,440
No TP.

251
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,360
They're gonna vote for main.

252
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,040
Yeah.

253
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,140
Okay.

254
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,260
Fiend top left.

255
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,040
I wall myself.

256
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,580
Where's wall?

257
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,240
Wolf on top left.

258
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,160
He's thrown in.

259
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,580
He's gonna brawl.

260
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,340
They're gonna brawl.

261
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,120
I'm gonna brawl.

262
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,160
I'm gonna brawl.

263
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,200
I can't.

264
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,200
I'm into dead.

265
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,340
No, just.

266
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,100
Oh, nice.

267
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,940
They used a lot.

268
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,060
He's heavy as well.

269
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,240
He's coop up.

270
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,560
I don't know.

271
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,400
Oh, I don't live.

272
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
He's chasing me.

273
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,700
Kill the hook maybe.

274
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,460
Kill the hook maybe.

275
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,460
No, it's fine.

276
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,240
Just chill.

277
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,080
Just wait.

278
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,420
Just wait.

279
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,380
Rockets, launch it again.

280
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,720
There's a wolf in main.

281
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,540
We can wait, we can wait.

282
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,640
We can walk up together.

283
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,400
Let's wait.

284
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,760
I woke up three, two, one.

285
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,500
Swing out, guys.

286
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,280
They're all top left.

287
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,420
Just walk main, just walk main.

288
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,020
They can't hold it.

289
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,440
Just walk.

290
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,540
They're all there.

291
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:46,940
They're all there.

292
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,300
Walk main.

293
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,220
Can you grab the wolf?

294
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,080
I have two items.

295
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,280
I have this.

296
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,620
I was gonna die.

297
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,800
We think it died.

298
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,040
Thing one, thing one, thing one.

299
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,640
Still die.

300
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,380
I'm dead.

301
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:57,700
I'm dead.

302
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,680
You can't live outside.

303
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,500
Live outside then.

304
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,200
I'm trying to live.

305
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,240
I'm trying to live.

306
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,340
I'm off the map, I think.

307
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,040
He jumped off too, though.

308
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,460
Kind of crazy.

309
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,180
I can see if it's in the back.

310
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:07,860
I'm living.

311
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,860
Can I still win?

312
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,640
I'm one.

313
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,540
We should win.

314
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,700
I put a res out.

315
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,200
Nice.

316
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,000
You have no ease.

317
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,140
There's wolf on point.

318
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,760
The wolf.

319
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:22,900
The wolf.

320
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,020
The wolf.

321
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,700
The wolf.

322
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,520
Someone else should wolf, please.

323
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,360
I'm fine.

324
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:26,740
Thank you.

325
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,020
Thank you.

326
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,720
I'm here no way.

327
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,560
We need to develop on them.

328
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,460
We need to develop on them.

329
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,160
We need to make a play now.

330
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:32,760
We need to walk.

331
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,400
We need to walk.

332
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,440
Don't be so scared.

333
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,240
Just walk at once.

334
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:37,840
Just walk.

335
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,220
Just walk.

336
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:38,720
Kill them.

337
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:38,960
Kill them.

338
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,260
Kill the people off the point.

339
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,000
Hold one.

340
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,860
No more.

341
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,480
He's team aggro.

342
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,240
Can I?

343
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,660
Okay, okay, okay.

344
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,040
Just wait.

345
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,360
Play slow.

346
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,300

Phoenix.

349
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,960
There were a lot of stuff.

350
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,680
I think five volts.

351
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,020

The old one.

356
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,030
Leave the win.

357
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,190

358
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:15,570
Nice old.

359
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,250
Good point, point, point, point.

360
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:19,890
We can go touch.

361
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,490
We can go touch.

362
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,330
Kill this guy.

363
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:21,730
Kill this guy.

364
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,110
I didn't mean.

365
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,790
It's kind of crazy that what stage grabs me.

366
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:26,930
Just wait.

367
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,790
We need to get Rocket.

368
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,790
They use nothing, guys.

369
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,310
They use nothing.

370
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,550
We should just play for Groot combo.

371
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,470
They're coming top left again.

372
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,890
Yeah, we need to get through without Groot combo.

373
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,530
So use everything onto it.

374
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,610
Play on me.

375
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,190
Play on me.

376
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,570
So top left guys.

377
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,130
We have to go here.

378
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:43,370
Okay.

379
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,790
Not set up.

380
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,330
You can flip there, main.

381
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,710
Wolves left side right now.

382
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,210
No shot.

383
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,290
They're all the way.

384
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:50,910
I'm going there, right?

385
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,530
I'm going main.

386
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,110
I'm going main.

387
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,470
Phoenix half, maybe.

388
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,050
Phoenix going in.

389
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,410
Phoenix walking up.

390
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,170
He's going to ult us.

391
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,290
Phoenix's holding up.

392
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:02,650
Phoenix's walking up.

393
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:02,850
He's gonna ult us.

394
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,450
He's gonna hit.

395
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,650
I'm 96.

396
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,350
I need to roll.

397
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,490
I need to roll.

398
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,370
I'm dead here.

399
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:07,850
I'm dead.

400
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,170
Kill the backline.

401
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:09,630
Kill the backline.

402
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,110
Kill the backline.

403
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,070
Loki, Loki, Loki.

404
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,430
I'm dead.

405
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,430
He was dead.

406
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:14,870
He was one.

407
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:15,570
Nice.

408
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,050
We can win.

409
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,590
We can win.

410
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:17,970
Oh, he didn't ult.

411
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:18,610
Fuck.

412
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,650
I got so low, dude.

413
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:22,910
I'm with you, Snake.

414
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:23,690
He's one.

415
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:24,250
No, I die.

416
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:24,730
Loki won.

417
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:25,370
Loki won.

418
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,430
I can't.

419
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,550
I'm just alone.

420
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,090
I'm dead.

421
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,610
One more fight.

422
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,390
I get rest, though.

423
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,190
We have better.

424
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,090
We can walk early.

425
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:34,950
We can walk early.

426
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:35,490
Go top left, I think.

427
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:35,890
Go top left.

428
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,110
Just go with Rocket Hood, yeah.

429
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,670
Okay.

430
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,090
Yeah, walk the breath then just go.

431
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:40,410
Yeah, full cooldown.

432
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,710
Maybe thing.

433
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,230
Wait everyone, wait everyone.

434
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,610
Just walk deep this time, okay?

435
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,350
They think they ulted me.

436
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,850
They still ulted me to kill me.

437
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,530
Yeah, they don't have them.

438
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:47,950
They don't know.

439
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:48,830
They're gonna have wolf.

440
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:49,410
They're gonna have wolf.

441
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,990
Phoenix on top right.

442
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,830
Can we walk?

443
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,630
Don't see wolf yet.

444
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,590
You guys need to walk first.

445
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,110
There's a wolf.

446
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,970
He's down below.

447
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:56,490
He's down below.

448
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,270
I'm walking.

449
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,970
Grab the wolf.

450
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,110
Grab the wolf.

451
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,330
I go.

452
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,630
Kill the wolf behind.

453
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,530
Hulk behind.

454
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,610
Turn Hulk, everybody.

455
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:04,130
Turn Hulk.

456
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:04,390
He missed one.

457
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:05,750
He's to left.

458
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,870
He's gonna die.

459
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,170
Oh, he's gonna die.

460
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:09,790
I've walked.

461
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,670
I've walked.

462
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:18,710
bro we almost have invas just live just live i'm trying to
there's a phoenix behind you there's a phoenix behind you

463
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:35,120
crook i mean as long as i can but i die crook i need to go
that dude first and i just carry and just kill everyone i

464
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:42,140
think i'm really frustrated i can't play into wolf it's
impossible i if i can't play the game like we don't have any

465
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:50,280
development on the map i need to be able to play either save
Venom or save Wolf save that pool one of the two things has

466
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,760
to happen need to be able to play

467
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:09,200
but yeah I mean this matchup should be good like we should
be able to drain the wolf HP it's fine let's play for that

468
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:18,620
pool yeah let's play for that pool oh it's convergence what
map we can go central I don't know what to do I'm getting

469
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:28,040
chased by the phoenix everywhere i'm just like i i run away
but like he follows me everywhere i guess we don't bankrupt

470
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:39,680
and when i'm with crook he just shoots me through him he
just still shoots me yeah no there's so it's best of three

471
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:53,160
so we have a chance to turn this around yeah we can go
clinta or central park If you want to play Broly, it should

472
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,920
be killing him.

473
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,260
No, I use my dash.

474
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,700
I use my dash to avoid the Phoenix, but he just, he has a
dash too.

475
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,980
He dashes in to me.

476
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:06,180
And then the thing is, like, I might, I have to wait.

477
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,000
I can't do anything else after that.

478
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:16,030
Yeah, I literally, every time I've used a dash for it.

479
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:17,950
Yeah.

480
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,250
Yeah.

481
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:19,690
No, I did.

482
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,830
They just said just hide.

483
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:28,050
and I'm like I'm hiding but she's still chasing me and
they're like just listen to her footsteps so you know when

484
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:41,500
she's coming and I'm like okay lose every time yeah and then
like literally I asked in the advice was like just live like

485
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,840
just just hide and I'm like oh I think that's a good idea

486
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:05,300
yeah it's just hard to outrun her I mean I'll try my best
I'll just I'll save two of my dashes blocking Buckyall is so

487
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:13,680
dumb when you're like on top of it I did I was using walls
to like dash too he can't block it though but he's just he

488
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:21,720
can aim this guy is like one of the their pros and he just
shoots me like it's not like right where like you can still

489
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:31,180
work behind you know the non-pros they're playing this is a
pro player it's just really frustrating yeah no they nerfed

490
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:39,140
the wall running they nerfed it so your wall run really slow
now yeah

491
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:54,230
he's a dps he's one of the dps pros so it's like really hard
no they want me on rocket I don't think I don't like Luna is

492
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,010
like really bad right now

493
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:07,510
they said they want rocket for this so I'm just like I'm
trying I feel bad because I'm getting hard targeted hard

494
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:12,530
targeted but the phoenix i can't outrun her

495
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:30,200
oh what about playing punisher if they're playing like
thinghulk at least until they get a mag go starlots starlots

496
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,380
is infinitely better into that just shoot them on range they
can never you can't try my best so at least you drain hp

497
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:43,780
just need to go i don't tell them they're just like hide
better you just got i just gotta be more aware of the

498
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:51,940
phoenix and i'll say i'll say two of my dashes yeah i feel
like money would it's fine with i guess i'll just save two

499
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,720
of my dashes

500
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:05,340
yeah at least at least until then miss go at least until
they swap into mag and then we could swap it up again we

501
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:12,780
could save if we want yeah but i i do think we just saved
that pool and i just played the game if i played that pool

502
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:20,800
last game we actually just win i don't even doubt it the
hero just does because they're already brawling with other

503
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:29,020
people they're already brawling and um i was trying to
follow crook everywhere but like he also um the moment he

504
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:35,240
goes like when the phoenix sees crook he goes invisible so
then the phoenix just swapped targets to me because that's

505
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,460
what happened when i was like playing with him he like went
invisible because he had the regen and then the phoenix just

506
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:53,940
went for me and then i was just like oh yeah what we had in
this game with loki and mantis so it's like it's so hard for

507
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:59,620
me because like i guess they won't ban that pool then then
you can say i just guys i guess i just gotta be aware of

508
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:10,740
where the phoenix is but it's so stressful to be aware i
think it's the best choice it's so stressful to be aware

509
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:24,580
phoenix or wolf what do you want to ban guys we should ban
wolf against the wolf i'll burn it yeah especially if

510
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:30,140
they're playing hulk thing too because he's just gonna get
thrown around half the time you don't have to worry about it

511
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:36,820
i mean the fact is they had everything they had all the team
ups for the wolf so he was just serve admin and i play good

512
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:46,920
so i can't stop him someone else has to stop him it's like
really annoying i better not have win the game fruits that's

513
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:54,280
a okay safe i guess just take all supports now or what do
you do who am i gonna banish from this match i guess still

514
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:04,020
do mantis man yeah i need a mantis man yeah mantis wolf
mantis wolf just because i have to hide my roses better

515
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:12,900
because they keep finding all my roses it's so frustrating i
was like i'll put it here and then they're like found found

516
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,260
it.

517
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,300
Um, here?

518
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,240
I don't know where to put my reses.

519
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,680
They found every single res I put.

520
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,800
Because they're always trying to fling.

521
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:38,690
The thing is, if I put too far away, I would put too far
away.

522
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,310
That's when we can finish.

523
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,930
Could be Angela.

524
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,070
Then like, then they won't get the res.

525
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,370
Pick me!

526
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:46,990
Pick me!

527
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,590
Please!

528
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,050
Invisban, pretty good.

529
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,450
Yeah, Invisban's fine.

530
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:55,470
Probably.

531
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,790
I mean, now we get a good matchup, I think.

532
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:00,570
Save.

533
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,350
What do we save here?

534
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,550
I think...

535
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,690
Luna or Rocket or Invis?

536
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,350
I think Invis.

537
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,650
I think Invis, yeah, I think Invis.

538
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,890
I like the Invisban a lot.

539
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:26,990
I mean, normally we can't ban it, they just saved Koot
first, so I guess we just took it for that.

540
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,470
Normally it's harder to ban it.

541
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:31,730
It's alright.

542
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,760
You'll need a top notch team to win this way.

543
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,540
Okay, I mean, that's fine.

544
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,620
Koot ban is kind of okay.

545
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,300
I wanted to play Deadpool anyway.

546
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,340
W.

547
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,460
I think we just played Phoenix Star, and I don't think they
can stop it.

548
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,420
And the question is, what does Doki play?

549
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,800
Do we go Luna Rocket or Invis Rocket?

550
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,260
Invis Rocket should be better, to be honest.

551
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,900
The only issue is that the Phoenix just is chasing me
everywhere.

552
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,800
And when I'm like, he like uses his dash to dash to me.

553
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,040
We can also play Invis Luna.

554
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,620
But then I have to like frontline into like it's not good
because they're going to have Groot.

555
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,880
So be aware they're going to have Groot.

556
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,880
We can go Luna Invis, but then we should keep you behind
them.

557
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,140
I'll do that.

558
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,960
It's possible.

559
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,100
Actually, I'll go to UTP.

560
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:33,560
TP?

561
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,200
The TP from before?

562
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,360
Yeah.

563
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,460
I got...

564
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,800
I can bubble it.

565
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,320
They're gonna maybe stun it.

566
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,040
Be careful.

567
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,680
The Phoenix's song that goes through the cosmos.

568
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,940
I'm impressed you can hear it.

569
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,300
It would sound sick with a beat under it.

570
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,580
I think I could sample it.

571
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,620
Let's trade.

572
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,640
The Phoenix is all about creation.

573
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:58,440
The battle starts in five, four, three, two, one.

574
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:09,980
all you need to do is capture the mission area got it that's
easy they have adam triple with adam probably oh loki yeah

No one died on.

578
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,640
We need to shoot the Hulk, guys.

579
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,760
Hulk one, don't make them yet.

580
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,040
I don't have Paul, I didn't have Paul.

581
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,160
He's one, he's one, he's one.

00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,220
I'm nice.

583
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,680
I'm shooting three.

584
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:47,880
I'm on HP.

585
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,220
Good half.

586
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,580
Can we lift?

587
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:51,920
Can we lift?

588
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,480
I can't.

589
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,360
Need to get out, need to get out.

590
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,340
I have upgrades.

591
00:30:59,300 --> 00:30:59,980
Just wait.

592
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,460
Can you give me flake crook?

593
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,560

594
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,020
Oh, what the fuck?

595
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,180
From behind.

596
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,680
I'll go around them.

597
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,160
I'll try at least.

598
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,720
Need to go top left.

599
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,220
I have upgrades soon.

600
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,200

637
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,540
We can hit after.

638
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,160
We can hit after.

639
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,600

Let them up.

643
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,220
They go right side.

644
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:44,780
They go right side.

645
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,160
Cloak, no fade.

646
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,200
I'm matching it.

647
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,240
I'm going top.

648
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,040
I hit them.

649
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,300
I hit them.

650
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:50,520
I hit them.

651
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,520
They're all behind me.

652
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:54,760

I'm dead.

656
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,640
They can clap.

657
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,800
I got a cap card.

658
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,720
How did he lift that?

659
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,640
They've aided it.

660
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,220
Go next.

661
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,700

00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,140
Yeah, they're on slowdown.

663
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,660
They're gonna have Drew Phoenix again.

664
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,280

00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:17,860

Add him, add him, add him, add him, add him.

688
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,100
No more.

689
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,740
Live it, live it, live it, live it, live it.

690
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,820
We need main feed.

00:35:59,490 --> 00:35:59,790
Dead.

721
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,630
Try to live, try to live.

722
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,470
I can go on Loki.

723
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,570
Yeah, yeah, no TP.

724
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,330
He's one, he's one.

725
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,030
Shooting, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

726
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:10,510
I pulled him back.

727
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,530
Oh, he didn't die.

728
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,170
I have water after this.

729
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:14,670
Just chill, just chill.

730
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,330
I'll hold it.

731
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:16,810
Don't die for anything.

732
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,050
Don't die for anything.

733
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:18,270
Yeah.

734
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,550
They probably have good art again.

735
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,810
Probably close, yeah.

736
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:23,630
They care.

737
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,610
He's doing that right in the open.

738
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,370
I don't know what's yet.

739
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:27,910
I will continue.

740
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,010
Live it, live it, live it, live it.

741
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,310
I have touch, I have touch for a bit.

742

744
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:58,690
led to death oh we don't have ppi there oh we should maybe
ban phoenix instead that's too much as well the current

745
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:03,030
score is one two We need a better hit on the backline, guys.

746
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,730
Need to wait out the dome.

747
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,030
And we need more pressure on the Groot.

748
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,050
I guess go Wolf.

749
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,330
I'm saying it.

750
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,470
Just go Wolf, Phoenix.

751
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,250
I feel like I don't know where to position.

752
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,330
I don't know where to position, guys.

753
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,430
Because it's like everyone's so split up.

754
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,250
Yeah, I think Mac.

755
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,350
Just get Mac and just go Phoenix, Wolf.

756
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,030
I think Emma actually.

757
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,050
Because they're going to crew now.

758
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,230
I'll just go wolf.

759
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:32,930
It's fine.

760
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:37,450
I think mag is essential for invas and...

761
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,170
No, they don't have invas.

762
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,850
Just go wolf and just grab them.

763
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,570
They can't do anything about it.

764
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,250
It's too OP.

765
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,770
The hero is so good.

766
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,450
Wait, ammo or magneto?

767
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,630
Ida is fine.

768
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,030
I think mag is honestly better.

769
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,910
But if you feel like emma is easier than throw emma.

770
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,810
You like they have to TP back though.

771
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:56,950
I got it.

772
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,350
Be careful.

773
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,970
We can flake the wolf as well.

774
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:07,950
should be fine to flake wolf i'm gonna stack with you guys
i'm just gonna play slow every cycle that i get we can try

775
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:15,410
to one-shot root do i just follow you around crew
positioning actually crew give me flake i need to flank i

776
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:24,490
think here you just need to play around this position with
me i'm gonna play around point two and i'll walk to you

777
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:35,890
after the man they start pushing all right they play tank
yeah they're gonna find the primary support right now yep

778
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:48,550
shouldn't focus them too much oh i'm gonna go for grew here

00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:55,870

support out very soon like don't feed don't feed don't feed

780
00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:03,010
i'm always they probably have to guide it we need to walk
inside and give ticks okay when they support ult do want to

Hide, hide, hide.

786
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,410
You do zero damage.

787
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:30,830
Just wait.

788
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:31,990

00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,670
Yeah, but you need to ult before that.

791
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,470
I was dying to Moon Knight.

792
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,470
Take, take, take, take, take, take.

793
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,150

I can hold it.

806
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,110
I'm touching it here.

807
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:29,770
Walk forward, walk forward.

808
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,490
Can I group moonlight?

809
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,270
Can I group moonlight?

810
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:32,830
Can I not just die?

811
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:34,050

I ee us.

814
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:37,770
I'm bad.

815
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,410
Why are you aiming at?

816
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,330
No, it's okay.

817
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,650
Loki won, Loki won, Loki won though.

818
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,970
I don't give up so easily.

819
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:47,790
I can kill.

820
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,610
Can you roll deep in this world?

821
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,390
I died there, but I'm coming back now.

822
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,810
I died in the group moonlight all.

823
00:40:54,990 --> 00:41:06,490
I don't I don't think I could touch I messed up We should
have given in this Oh, I missed all I'm dead here

824
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,130
We gave him cloak all early too.

825
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:22,770
We just kept feeding into him They're sitting in the bubble
I feel bad

826
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:33,090
Yeah, we're out of the tournament I feel bad.

827
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,040
I just felt, I definitely felt heavily targeted.

828
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,440
It happens.

829
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,760
It's fine.

830
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,840
Yeah, I mean, we're out, but we can...

831
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,980
I don't know if you can still make it out.

832
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,440
No, it's...

833
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,660
No, no, no.

834
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,080
Two games you don't...

835
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,720
Yeah, two games you don't go to finals.

836
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,020
Do we lose two?

837
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,700
I see.

838
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,000
Are you sure?

839
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,700
yeah yeah it's confirmed there's no way

840
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:34,310
what wait it's first of three no no he's just rolling us i
see she's just rolling i was like i think like people forgot

841
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:41,930
that i needed to be microd because i said oh can you guys
tell me once at all and then i just been waiting i don't

842
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:49,870
think we play all the other games then you want to call it
or what yeah i don't think there's i mean yeah yeah yeah i

843
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:57,830
mean do we i don't know if we should no i think we should i
think we should play them i kind of don't to be honest but i

844
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:05,550
don't either i don't think it's worth i get i get groups
points we just leave i don't know because we have two our

845
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,350
weights in between again it's gonna be same as yesterday

846
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,730
No, it's okay.

847
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,090
GG's guys.

848
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,770
If you guys want to call it, I'm cool with that.

849
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:18,670
I think it's top 10 teams.

850
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:19,030
Are you sure?

851
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:20,110
Yeah.

852
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:21,590
I'm pretty sure like...

853
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:22,310
No, no.

854
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:26,290
They said if you have a seven to one record, they reiterate
Sarah Times.

855
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:29,110
If you lost twice, you don't proceed to fine around.

856
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,730
We can't get top 10 with two losses anyway.

857
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:34,810
It's not possible with these many teams.

858
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:36,050
It's impossible.

859
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:36,990
Yeah.

860
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,330
I mean, it's fun with me too.

861
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:48,370
i'll talk to my mother because my father died a year ago
like exactly on today so i'll see and i played this

862

That was, that was a good experience.

879
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:31,590
Like I actually learned a lot.

880
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,130
I'm going to rate you though.

881
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:32,970
I'm going to rate you though.

882
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:33,970
Okay.

883
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:41,550
okay i i appreciate your tips trust me actually it made me
think about the game differently pause i mean yeah that's

884
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:49,090
that's the point it's fine it's fine it's kind of have to
like work hard right and then you do your best all right

885
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:51,870
yeah i see you guys around ggs

886
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:10,830
i feel bad i feel really bad i i like held my alt for so
long too because I was waiting for the cause for it and then

887
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:20,810
like the one time I got called to ult I I didn't finish
listening to Kropea use it defensively and I already ulted

888
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:35,070
it I was like oh I'm sorry I felt so bad and then um and
then yeah and I just was waiting for um i was waiting to be

889
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:46,830
microed but i felt like um i think everyone was like so
chaotic yeah everyone was so chaotic so i just i i didn't

890
00:45:46,830 --> 00:46:00,610
think for myself and stuff too um well yeah but when i was
rocket too when i was on rocket um i was like holding it as

891
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:02,910
well and yeah

892
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:16,990
and yeah and then like I was holding on to it and because I
was waiting to like for the call and I felt like oh I could

893
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:19,230
have built my alt like three times here

894
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:37,750
yeah yeah I feel I just feel bad because I felt like I was
sort of dragging my team back there because I as because i

895
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:41,650
also got picked i was getting picked several times because i
was just like

896
00:46:49,570 --> 00:47:02,810
no we had really bad matchup rng in general yeah we had like
two good teams and then like tara's team is literally just

897
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:11,670
literally just walk i mean his team is the best but like i'm
like bro give us the freebie teams yo you're the best team

898
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:26,060
this these teams are nothing to you give us the freebies
yeah it isn't lucky i know like i did learn a lot but i do

899
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:35,940
feel bad because for them the money means a lot to them too
so like they could if they like you know um by picking me

900
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:45,080
it's sort of like did set them back a bit um because i was
like the little baby on the team and i felt really bad

901
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:56,040
because like you know for them the money means more to them
um and i was just like oh i wish i wish i was a better

902
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:09,860
player type deal yeah um but i did i did I just felt like
they definitely, they definitely, the enemy team, uh, the

903
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:17,480
enemy team definitely hard focused on me because they knew I
was the weakest because like, I felt like I was fucking

904
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,740
being chased from Nania.

905
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,100
Like I've never felt like when we do, we're doing scrims and
stuff.

906
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:30,620
I was, it was not, I was not getting chased as hard as, as
that, yeah.

907
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:48,670
another tournament i do have another turn i i do have to
show up tomorrow though i do yeah i i do have to show up

908
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:55,430
tomorrow for like the show match i most likely i'll be
streaming that on twitch though because it's just a show

909
00:48:55,430 --> 00:49:02,470
match and then i go back to rank yeah no it's for the j3
tournament um i'm in the show match for it okay i'm since i

910
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:10,910
don't have to try anymore i can put this back to window mode
i Like, you know, I do feel fucking bad, you know?

911
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:14,350
Because, like, Croak was obviously very mad.

912
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:17,470
Like, he instantly left.

913
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:18,370
And I was like, oh.

914
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:29,950
I'm just like, oh, he left instantly.

915
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:31,170
Oh.

916
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:34,890
Yeah.

917
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:53,770
I don't know.

918
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:54,730
I don't know.

919
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:57,410
It's because, like, I...

920
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:59,790
I did get picked a lot.

921
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:10,310
So that's why I was just like, I felt like, you know, he
would have had an easier time.

922
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:14,430
And my positioning was, like, you know...

923
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:16,630
Yeah.

924
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:28,870
especially like the last fight when it was like me and him
and then the like i couldn't get back to him in time we're

925
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:40,250
doing right now i do um i think for me i because i don't
want to i don't know i just feel bad letting people down you

926
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:55,970
know i feel i feel really bad uh letting people down um and
i feel like oh man because for me like obviously uh the

927
00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:03,790
money means a lot more to them and i uh i just felt really
bad because i was like oh if i played if i was a better

928
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:15,010
player we could have beat this team yeah but i definitely uh
i definitely i think like for these tournaments like it's my

929
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:23,710
i know j3 said he's gonna host another community clash but
i'm definitely not gonna join the next community clash

930
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:32,390
because i think unless he like unless i get into like the
captain slot for it because um the captain teams are a lot

931
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:42,750
easier um like not easier but they get in automatically but
like i will i feel like the teams that are in the cap the

932
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:47,930
ones that get in without having to go through the qualifiers
the teams that got in while having to go through the

933
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:56,790
qualifiers are a lot easier than um they're not like i'm not
gonna they're not bad but like some of the teams and the

934
00:51:56,790 --> 00:52:05,370
qualifiers are harder than the um some of the teams and the
qualifiers are harder than the ones that got in

935
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:15,970
automatically i will say that i feel like i feel like it's i
feel like that because like the some of the teams that got

936
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:25,010
in aren't like um uh like the teams that aren't
automatically in they're like the top like you know the

937
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:34,370
current lan the current lan winners and stuff like you know
na winners or like eu winners and stuff that are in

938
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:42,130
qualifiers from what i've and i know like um because i've
seen two because there's four teams that get in

939
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,830
automatically and i've seen two for it.

940
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:53,970
And I know that, like, I know I know, like, five other teams
in the qualifiers that are stronger than the two content

941
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:54,730
creator teams.

942
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:00,010
Yeah.

943
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:02,530
So it's day.

944
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:07,330
So qualifiers was definitely very, very hard.

945
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:10,190
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

946
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:14,750
I didn't help that I had to fucking rush to the vet.

947
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:17,030
But I will take account of it.

948
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,850
I definitely was the weakest link there.

949
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:23,630
I definitely was the weakest link.

950
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:27,150
I mean, for sure, I...

951
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:30,170
Um...

952
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:34,150
I mean, like, the next time, if I do another...

953
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,730
If I do another...

954
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:44,350
If it was another similar tournament like this, I won't
participate unless I'm, like, automatically in...

955
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:46,690
Like, automatically in the finals!

956
00:53:51,190 --> 00:54:02,730
because then like i don't because then i don't have to
disappoint anyone i don't have to disappoint anyone we're

957
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:14,790
automatically in anyway gonna be stronger i don't know just
because that you can first the battle starts in five four

958
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:23,910
three two yeah i do that that I didn't but like I did die a
lot of times when I shouldn't have died like when the

959
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:32,170
Phoenix was chasing me like if I was a better player I guess
I would have known where they were gonna fucking where she

960
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:41,790
was gonna fucking prepare cuz you're like just listen to
footsteps I was like oh my god I I do not play enough to

961
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:51,030
know what the fuck how to do that like so casually you know
just listen to it on footsteps I'm like man I wish I play

962
00:54:51,030 --> 00:55:03,110
enough to be able to do that to be able to just listen to it
on footsteps and then predict the fucking future how the

963
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:13,130
fuck did the Groot live yeah yeah but they said it's so
casually it's like they like obviously cuz they're better

964
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:16,170
players like yeah it's like Like what you do?

965
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:24,290
And I'm just like, oh, listen to no push.

966
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:28,690
Oh we have a story for CG's.

967
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:34,690
Man I wish we have like a character that can, I don't know.

968
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:43,890
The a motherfucking destroyer was, at least I already went
through my, I'm gonna do the thing that I learned.

969
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:46,590
Aggressively forward!

970
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:48,590
Alright, well, we're dead.

971
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:49,990
I did my best.

972
00:55:59,220 --> 00:55:59,600
Alright.

973
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:00,920
It was fun.

974
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,880
I did do the thing now.

975
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:03,520
I was tired.

976
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,200
I aggressively ulted forward.

977
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,200
No Invis.

978
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:08,860
Oh, that they killed.

979
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,560
They killed Invis.

980
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,320
Oh my god, let me through.

981
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,420
Can we, like, at least kill Groot?

982
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,120
Please, he is what?

983
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,500
Oh my, at least we finally did it.

984
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:25,820
Raid boss down.

985
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,460
What the?

986
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,040
Oh, I should have pulled him back.

987
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,000
He, like, surprised me.

988
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:31,780
Throw in all.

989
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:32,840
Watch the door roll.

990
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,880
Okay, I will say I definitely should have pulled him.

991
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,940
She might be top left now.

992
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,400
Yeah, she's over there.

993
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,520
She's out.

994
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,540
Yeah, I will, I think our team did not have enough time to
build chemistry.

995
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,300
We're definitely, like, chemistry over there.

996
00:56:52,320 --> 00:57:02,920
wise definitely could have been better like you can have
literally the best players but if there's no chemistry like

997
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:09,640
you know we could have i don't know you know it would be
cool if we have a clone out right now look all right now yep

998
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:21,080
there we go yep that's fine i'll have to look up i'm getting
fucking beat up but that's fine i got tb back oh i could

999
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:21,680
have killed it

1000
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:31,020
oh i got it i'm not gonna place the on my way for supports

1001
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:45,180
no we had a warm-up scrim yeah no we did we had a warm-up
scrim but our warm-up scrim is was against like fucking

1002
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,580
Tara's team.

1003
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,120
I don't know.

1004
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,260
I was just...

1005
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,320
Like, playing against, like, the fucking raid boss.

1006
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,660
Actual, like, Kobe Bryant.

1007
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:57,860
Well, this is where we die.

1008
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:03,020
Playing against LeBron James and Kobe Bryant.

1009
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,540
He's back from the dead.

1010
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:09,950
Every stream.

1011
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:11,690
Every warm-up stream you play.

1012
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:13,770
Why get off Invis?

1013
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:25,150
Invis is literally the strongest on torch i don't know but
why didn't you pick fucking anything else then go get off

1014
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:32,850
support let me go support i don't know i'll play it yeah i
feel like i'm doing it after all wonders on dps but what

1015
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:42,630
whatever sub everything will kill i don't know if he knows
this but i mean i'll go fine i'll go look i don't think he

1160
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,700
It was one tournament out of many.

1161
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,000
Of course, I would feel bad, though.

1162
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:13,980
Crook.

1163
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:18,600
Crook instantly left the group chat.

1164
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,220
Okay.

1165
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:36,000
yeah he he's definitely not happy he yeah he like just left
the group chat

1166
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:54,690
he did not with us i mean well i i have to be like so it's
like oh i don't like how you blair but i i have to take

1167
01:11:54,690 --> 01:12:03,390
accountability like i'm not gonna make excuses for myself
like i was the weakest link on that team and obviously like

1168
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:11,590
you know as the support partner for crook I did I felt
really bad because I was always leaving him out to solo by

1169
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:21,290
himself um and like you know I can't just be like oh it's
not my fault like oh um and stuff so I'm just taking

1170
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:29,530
accountability for like because like it was I I like I said
I was the weakest link and the other teams knew i was the

1171
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:41,970
weakest link and like hardcore targeted me um i well it's
just because like during that last two games it felt like if

1172
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:53,930
i was alive definitely like uh i just didn't know how to
play for my life in that situation yeah i just i just don't

1173
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:55,830
know and i was like trying to ask

1174
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:02,950
But when I try to take their advice, it was still happening,
yeah.

1175
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:17,230
So it's like, it feels like, oh, maybe I should have, like,
obviously it's, like, all in hindsight, too.

1176
01:13:18,050 --> 01:13:18,270
Yeah.

1177
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:26,830
It's, like, all in hindsight, like, obviously, if I was a
better player, I would have known how to survive better.

1178
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:34,030
But it was just very difficult because it was, like, they
hard-focused me, and I felt like, oh, how could I have

1179
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:34,350
positioned?

1180
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:41,230
myself better in a way where and I was also like very I felt
like a headless chicken at times because I was trying to be

1181
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:43,870
like when do I own and stuff yeah

1182
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:52,140
yeah it was also like that was also uh

1183
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:08,840
I mean I did learn a lot like I was fucking roaming or like
I was literally dodging everything as I did learn a lot

1184
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:25,520
though playing this uh and and Um, and it's like, it's like,
I wish I, I wish that I was a better player, because I did

1185
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:31,980
feel, I mean, like, you know, they're very sad about it and
everything, um, because the money means a lot to them, so it

1186
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:39,560
was just more so of like, like, I'm not trying to be like
making excuses, and I knew that I didn't make mistakes

1187
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:45,260
there, since like, I lacked the knowledge, I lacked the
knowledge and the game sense.

1188
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:58,100
and i i definitely relied on them a lot on how to play and i
think that also obviously interfered a lot as well um and

1189
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:06,680
because like you know i held my alt a lot as well i held i
was holding my alts um and i was like i was like where do i

1190
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:15,260
go like i kept being like where do i position myself i i
feel like everywhere i go i die

1191
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:31,660
like I was just like oh man everywhere I go and like I
definitely yeah and and it's like I I felt like I just I

1192
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:42,840
needed to be microed I needed to be right microed but
because the way I play in rank is so different um the way I

1193
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:48,780
play in rank is so different than the way I play in screen
because when I try to play the way I play in rank in scrims,

1194
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:52,780
I got like not told off, but they're like, don't stop doing
that.

1195
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:56,380
They're like, stop doing, like, not stop, they're like, just
like, stop doing that.

1196
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:57,020
You're alting wrong.

1197
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,660
And I was like, oh, I'm sorry.

1198
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:04,320
Like, this wasn't like streamed or anything, but like, it
was like the very first scrim, the very first two scrims I

1199
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,240
did with them, they're like, you're alting wrong.

1200
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:08,540
Like, you should not alt like this.

1201
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:11,140
And I was like, oh, this is how I alting rank.

1202
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,000
I'm sorry.

1203
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:18,540
And they're like, if you're, because like, I alt to try Like
I saw my tanks though and I was just like, Oh, I'm going to

1204
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:18,920
rip it.

1205
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:19,800
I'm just going to rip it.

1206
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:26,420
And then, um, and then they were like, yeah, no, you have to
alt like this.

1207
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:29,100
And I'm like, okay, okay, I'll do that now.

1208
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:36,300
But obviously it's not the same as like, they're like, if
you, if the tanks are dying, just save your alt because

1209
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,040
that's their fault.

1210
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,060
That's the, uh, that's the tanks fault.

1211
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:43,080
It's not your fault that like you didn't save them.

1212
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:48,800
It's a tanks fault for feeding They ended up dying and need
an alt to save them.

1213
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:51,960
And I was just like, oh, okay.

1214
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:57,820
And I was like, oh, and that's why I was like, I think I
need to be micro because I don't know when to properly alt

1215
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:03,040
then because I felt like every time we didn't have a, we
didn't have a lot of game plan.

1216
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:12,310
No, I, no, I'm considered a non-pro.

1217
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:17,250
I was categorized as a non-pro.

1218
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:18,650
So I...

1219
01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:26,530
and no i don't want to do another vod review bro guys i
don't want to do a vod review guys i'm not fucking going i'm

1220
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:39,390
not going through pro play ptsd yeah it's it's done it's
done i don't need a vod review i play this as a side thing

1221
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:55,670
no more please yeah i'm i'm Yeah, and it's like, I know what
I did wrong.

1222
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:57,090
It's just my positioning.

1223
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:58,390
I know what I did wrong.

1224
01:17:58,570 --> 01:18:05,210
My positioning was just very not like, like they could tell
my positioning is worse than everyone else.

1225
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:09,010
So they hard focused me because I just didn't know where to
go.

1226
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:10,610
Yeah.

1227
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:14,010
So it's like, it's just unfortunate.

1228
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:18,730
They just knew how to focus me just because like, I am the
weakest player.

1229
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:20,170
I got Whisper.

1230
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:28,630
Oh, is that Agu?

1231
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:35,110
Well, Truss said he wants to play, so I don't know if he's
coming back, but sure.

1232
01:18:36,370 --> 01:18:36,890
Sure.

1233
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:39,070
Oh, fuck.

1234
01:18:39,690 --> 01:18:39,690
Sure.

1235
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:42,110
Um.

1236
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,240
I'm just reflecting.

1237
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,220
Reflecting about it.

1238
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,240
Dude.

1239
01:18:56,340 --> 01:19:04,560
I mean, like, I said before one of the main reasons why i
feel really sad is that um i saw that trust me was looking

1240
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:13,600
for players like trust me and crook and then one of my
friends is actually next door neighbors with crook so i

1241
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:23,320
asked him if he could like okay give me a good word for it
like if i could join crook's team and um like you know and

1242
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:33,740
then i felt bad because like my friend who's like next door
with crook got me on the team like yeah like yeah in real

1243
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:40,840
life yeah like they actually known each other's for like
since before like before like he became pro and I felt

1244
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:51,640
really really bad too because of that um because like you
know my friend vouched for me and um yeah so and then you

1245
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:59,880
know that's why I felt really bad that crook obviously is
like not happy about it and uh yeah i'm just waiting for the

1246
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:12,120
yeah yeah no i saw the whispers guys i saw it yeah sure yeah
sure yeah i saw the whispers guys yeah

1247
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:24,920
that's why it sucks a lot more for me because obviously the
reason why i was even on the team was because um

1248
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:42,720
to be like to be on that team and then I felt like oh man he
could have got like obviously a different support I

1249
01:20:51,860 --> 01:21:00,260
mean it's not discouraging me from tournaments overall but I
think for these tournaments this one the fact that it's very

1250
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:10,780
very heavily in favor of like people who Like, I'm way out
of my, what's it called?

1251
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:15,480
I'm way out of my comfort zone.

1252
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:23,240
Like, not comfort zone, because way out of my skill level.

1253
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:24,200
Way out my depth.

1254
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:25,760
Yeah, I'm way out my depth in it.

1255
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:31,900
Just because, like, the teams are element, because the teams
we're first seeing are people who play rank every single

1256
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:32,400
day.

1257
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:35,780
They play rank every single day.

1258
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:52,630
this guy wait is that did i join some bud someone's random i
i hope this is aga i swear to god if i oh okay i okay okay

1259
01:21:52,630 --> 01:22:06,250
cute and it's like i just joining some guys random yeah i
hope that's his alt account yeah yeah

1260
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:24,510
so it's like yeah constant vodka we can and uh scrims every
day and rank every day yeah i just no i've had that happen

1261
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:33,130
i've had random people add me like randomly invite me and
just and i had to just block them i just i just blocked them

1262
01:22:33,130 --> 01:22:46,890
so because if you block them they can't spam invite and i
don't i don't got time for that i don't have time for for

1263
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:49,950

but like I don't think we're winning this I don't think I

1327
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:43,130
don't think it's winnable so like I'm fine

1328
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:49,860
Oh, goodbye, everybody.

1329
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:51,940
Oh, shit.

1330
01:31:03,670 --> 01:31:04,750
We're here for goodbye.

1331
01:31:04,930 --> 01:31:08,090
I mean, we got Spidey and Widow.

1332
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:12,690
Like, I think it's, like, literally the combo.

1333
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:16,490
Oh, my God, he's dead.

1334
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:19,690
Oh, my God, we're dead, too.

1335
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:22,230
Why would you all say...

1336
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:30,890
so far from us holy shit that's crazy that was from nanya

1337
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:38,210

01:31:53,710 --> 01:31:59,870

go 05.

1341
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:08,930
You know, if I was any other healer, this could have been
more winnable.

1342
01:32:09,350 --> 01:32:10,090
Not gonna lie.

1343
01:32:11,470 --> 01:32:14,510
Most likely, I have a feeling.

1344
01:32:18,390 --> 01:32:21,830
Only because then, then we would have more heals.

1345
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:28,930
Man, it would be cool if we broke it.

1346
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:45,950
yeah there we go all right I am bro that's funny the widow
is spamming I need

1347
01:32:54,490 --> 01:33:10,030

1350
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:47,210

some moments where I'm like I don't think our team deserves

1351
01:33:47,210 --> 01:33:56,890
anything what I didn't have I didn't have Snap

1352
01:34:04,110 --> 01:34:16,530
Time to switch things up including which side you're on
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

1353
01:34:16,530 --> 01:34:20,870
I am Loki goddess of mischief and the queen of Asgard

1354
01:34:24,970 --> 01:34:27,030
Can I state your ship?

1355
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:39,630

1358
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:16,660
spider totem all right so i wonder if they're like oh at
least we're gone triple support maybe we'll have more heals

1359
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:24,460
now Imagine if there was a cliff here.

01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:36,780
Alright, I better see like at least one kill from this man.

1367
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:03,720
Not you.

1368
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:09,840

1488
01:51:41,670 --> 01:51:43,370
I still can't believe that happened to me.

1489
01:51:43,970 --> 01:51:48,970
That was the craziest fucking oh wait, they weren't pushing.

1490
01:51:49,170 --> 01:51:50,370
Alright, which is already

1491
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:55,330
Yeah, poor dude.

1492
01:51:55,490 --> 01:51:58,090
Well, now that I know that...

1493
01:51:58,090 --> 01:52:01,130
I jumped up hoping that I would like click...

1494
01:52:01,130 --> 01:52:03,870
Because I've seen it apparently happen in pro play before.

1495
01:52:05,210 --> 01:52:07,090
That's why people were like, what the fuck?

1496
01:52:07,810 --> 01:52:09,630
Because it has happened in pro play.

1497
01:52:11,990 --> 01:52:13,930
Who is he shielding that from?

1498
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:25,260
Where the fuck are the supports?

1499
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:41,080
is there like any support like we're at the support since
the enemy team the current score is zero y'all did disappear

1500
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:49,260
Melkor did you give us super chat thank you thank you that's
crazy that that can like I've seen it happen like I've like

1501
01:52:49,260 --> 01:53:03,160
seen a clip of that happen um yeah yeah I jumped up to avoid
it, avoid it, but somehow it still went through.

1502
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:09,470
I fucking copied it.

1503
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:23,600
Yeah, like I jumped up and then I went and clicked below me.

1504
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,320
But somehow me being above the portal placed it in the
portal.

1505
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:34,960
30 seconds before you attack.

1506
01:53:35,300 --> 01:53:35,740
Get ready.

1507
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:39,320
That's fucking crazy.

1508
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:45,400
Max Ranger, oh, what the fuck is that?

1509
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:47,080
What the fuck is that?

1510
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,160
Yeah, I know something.

1511
01:53:56,420 --> 01:54:02,640
The battle starts in five, four, three, two, one.

1512
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:05,880
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

1513
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:10,940
Oh, yeah, I've done that before.

1514
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:18,530
Alright.

1515
01:54:26,580 --> 01:54:26,840
Oh.

1516
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:29,340
No, I know what they mean.

1517
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:31,380
I do that sometimes, but not all the time.

1518
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:36,740
Because I don't feel safe.

1519
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:41,640
I never feel safe.

1520
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:44,700
Oh, yeah.

1521
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:46,600
Yeah.

1522
01:54:48,820 --> 01:54:50,240
Oh, maybe I wasted that.

1523
01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:52,620
Oh, I should have saved it.

1524
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,180
Oh, I should have saved Invan!

1525
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:56,640
Oh, my mantis is fat.

1526
01:54:58,140 --> 01:54:58,940
Oh, no.

1527
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:00,260
It's okay.

1528
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:03,920
Technically, I didn't waste Invan because there was no way
to save them, technically.

1529
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:05,220
If you think about it.

1530
01:55:10,630 --> 01:55:11,690
Oh, we can do this!

1531
01:55:11,890 --> 01:55:12,410
Let's go!

1532
01:55:14,790 --> 01:55:16,650
Well, now we can't do anything.

1533
01:55:18,930 --> 01:55:20,350
Well, never mind.

1534
01:55:21,330 --> 01:55:22,830
Technically we can't do anything no more.

1535
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:24,070
Oh, unless!

1536
01:55:29,170 --> 01:55:29,710
Oh.

1537
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:32,810
Let me just chill here, I guess.

1538
01:55:35,670 --> 01:55:36,130
There you go.

1539
01:55:37,390 --> 01:55:39,890
Like, I don't know what their whole plan is.

1540
01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:43,810
I don't know what the Emma's plan is to try and fucking mind
control me.

1541
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:47,250
But I ain't no Snow Bunny.

1542
01:55:51,010 --> 01:55:51,470
Alright.

1543
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:00,920
This here?

1544
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:02,860
Like, don't keep these.

1545
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:10,240
All I'm saying is I'm the wrong target for this mind
controller.

1546
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:13,940
You literally, like, went up to me.

1547
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,740
I was just like, bro, what the fuck are you doing?

1548
01:56:18,140 --> 01:56:18,680
Not me.

1549
01:56:21,620 --> 01:56:22,540
Wrong person.

1550
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:24,240
Not the right demographic.

1551
01:56:34,730 --> 01:56:36,610
I should save him.

1552
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:38,410
Nah, he's fine.

1553
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:40,870
Oh,

1554
01:56:46,650 --> 01:56:47,570
that's awkward for me.

1555
01:56:49,710 --> 01:56:50,010
Oh, nice.

1556
01:56:50,090 --> 01:56:51,210
He's aiming for the mantis.

1557
01:56:51,770 --> 01:56:52,230
That's good.

1558
01:56:54,170 --> 01:56:56,370
Okay, I don't know what his plan is.

1559
01:56:58,190 --> 01:56:59,110
Oh, my God.

1560
01:56:59,410 --> 01:56:59,970
Oh, my.

1561
01:57:00,830 --> 01:57:03,550
win this let's go

1562
01:57:06,740 --> 01:57:18,600
there we go i told you it's still winnable no longer no
longer no it's still winnable oh that's awkward for him all

1563
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:31,180
right so the only issue is that they do have buckio and they
do have this in that cubby hook oh and he missed it's okay

1564
01:57:31,180 --> 01:57:36,360
he didn't hit my clone so he can't Okay, it's fine.

1565
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:41,240
Oh my god, they kneeled.

1566
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:49,350
Oh, see, it's winnable.

1567
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:50,250
It's so winnable.

1568
01:57:50,670 --> 01:57:51,610
It's always winnable.

1569
01:57:58,970 --> 01:57:59,970
It's so over.

1570
01:58:00,070 --> 01:58:00,930
We're so back.

1571
01:58:04,190 --> 01:58:05,870
Oh, I don't know why I put that there.

1572
01:58:06,290 --> 01:58:07,750
It's just for aesthetic, I guess.

1573
01:58:09,770 --> 01:58:10,770
I was like, hmm.

1574
01:58:13,470 --> 01:58:14,890
wanted that clone in there.

1575
01:58:15,410 --> 01:58:16,230
Like a little buddy.

1576
01:58:16,910 --> 01:58:17,850
My new best friend.

1577
01:58:18,330 --> 01:58:18,690
Myself.

1578
01:58:19,450 --> 01:58:20,330
Fuck, I don't trust.

1579
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:21,090
I need heals.

1580
01:58:21,470 --> 01:58:27,250
I have another ulti soon.

1581
01:58:30,250 --> 01:58:30,510
Oh.

1582
01:58:31,370 --> 01:58:31,890
Oh.

1583
01:58:33,070 --> 01:58:33,430
Goodbye.

1584
01:58:35,570 --> 01:58:36,610
Goodbye, everybody.

1585
01:58:36,830 --> 01:58:38,670
I don't even think this is a winnable fight.

1586
01:58:38,810 --> 01:58:39,610
We lost three.

1587
01:58:40,250 --> 01:58:41,390
Nope, we lost four.

1588
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:42,830
Wait, I can't.

1589
01:58:43,470 --> 01:58:55,710
can't count it was actually three that's all right you don't
watch me for my math i think if i copy cloak it'd be better

1590
01:58:55,710 --> 01:59:03,310
right i need to oh

1591
01:59:10,250 --> 01:59:12,530
oh don't wait we'll have double

1592
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:18,760
Again!

1593
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:20,620
Round two!

1594
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:27,050
There you go, round two, round two!

1595
01:59:27,190 --> 01:59:27,890
There's no way.

1596
01:59:30,410 --> 01:59:31,390
What's your push?

1597
01:59:34,470 --> 01:59:38,270
Okay, we had three people pushing, we actually would have
made it.

1598
01:59:39,190 --> 01:59:40,310
Okay, that's...

1599
01:59:40,310 --> 01:59:41,450
Oh, Daisy jumped up!

1600
01:59:41,550 --> 01:59:42,430
You're so stupid!

1601
01:59:43,090 --> 01:59:44,870
Three, two, two!

1602
01:59:51,730 --> 01:59:54,630
You're seriously jumped up in this hug.

1603
01:59:57,550 --> 01:59:58,090
Nice.

1604
02:00:01,490 --> 02:00:03,130
What a throw.

1605
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:07,710
Easy.

1606
02:00:08,330 --> 02:00:09,110
Just like that.

1607
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:10,170
It's just that easy.

1608
02:00:13,390 --> 02:00:14,330
Wait, what was it?

1609
02:00:14,550 --> 02:00:16,430
Oh, I've done that before.

1610
02:00:16,730 --> 02:00:18,170
I already know how to do it.

1611
02:00:37,030 --> 02:00:40,070
I mean, I'm going to be up front.

1612
02:00:45,130 --> 02:00:45,570
Valid.

1613
02:00:49,570 --> 02:00:58,050
Oh, like, basically what he's saying is, like, if I know how
to, like, just Invisalt into, like, not be, like, just be

1614
02:00:58,050 --> 02:00:59,750
far away and just Invisalt like that.

1615
02:00:59,910 --> 02:01:00,830
And I was like, yeah, I know.

1616
02:01:00,990 --> 02:01:02,030
I just don't care.

1617
02:01:03,590 --> 02:01:04,290
It's rank.

1618
02:01:04,630 --> 02:01:05,670
It's rank.

1619
02:01:06,050 --> 02:01:07,910
I'm just...

1620
02:01:08,510 --> 02:01:10,230
I'm just playing the play.

1621
02:01:11,110 --> 02:01:12,710
Also, especially in this Elo.

1622
02:01:16,010 --> 02:01:18,050
I normally don't get punished.

1623
02:01:24,070 --> 02:01:26,510
Yeah, it's a Doom Q for a reason.

1624
02:01:26,970 --> 02:01:27,510
Exactly.

1625
02:01:29,090 --> 02:01:29,290
Who

1626
02:01:32,770 --> 02:01:34,510
am I gonna banish from this match?

1627
02:01:34,770 --> 02:01:35,310
Exactly.

1628
02:01:52,730 --> 02:01:54,850
Arnie is the Bathrow Bear back, guys.

1629
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:33,470
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

1630
02:02:57,540 --> 02:02:58,380
Alright, I'm back.

1631
02:02:58,640 --> 02:02:59,380
Okay, Jeff.

1632
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:02,260
What the fuck are these, like, Elo-Terrorist lobbies?

1633
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:04,600
I guess because I am an Elo-Terrorist as well.

1634
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:04,980
Alright.

1635
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:08,400
You know what?

1636
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,280
Fuck it.

1637
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:12,800
Actually, no.

1638
02:03:12,940 --> 02:03:14,140
This might be pretty bad.

1639
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:16,400
Animal Crossing.

1640
02:03:16,660 --> 02:03:17,360
Let's go.

1641
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:19,900
Uh, Juge, thank you for the super chat.

1642
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:27,200
Uh, Juge, uh, Burr, uh, Bayet, W, Lacron, Alan, thank you
for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1643
02:03:35,060 --> 02:03:38,380
I mean, we're all euloteric in this lobby.

1644
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:41,340
Oh.

1645
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:42,580
Uh-oh.

1646
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:45,380
Three, two, one.

1647
02:03:48,110 --> 02:03:49,690
It's alright, they don't need my heals.

1648
02:03:52,850 --> 02:03:53,530
Oh my god.

1649
02:04:05,930 --> 02:04:14,670
I wonder I has the new the newest one has to be DPS like she
literally has a fucking shotgun what's she gonna do like

1650
02:04:14,670 --> 02:04:22,930
shotgun the heels the heels are my shotgun pellets to shoot
someone to

1651
02:04:28,930 --> 02:04:36,850
I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure like um I fucking knew it I
had a feeling Oh yeah, nice.

1652
02:04:37,310 --> 02:04:37,830
Our heal.

1653
02:04:42,550 --> 02:04:42,710
Oh.

1654
02:04:43,290 --> 02:04:43,990
It's okay.

1655
02:04:44,110 --> 02:04:46,130
Everyone is still somehow alive.

1656
02:04:47,370 --> 02:04:50,410
Which is always nice when they somehow are still living.

1657
02:04:50,890 --> 02:04:51,230
You know what?

1658
02:04:51,410 --> 02:04:51,690
Fuck.

1659
02:04:52,050 --> 02:04:52,370
You're up.

1660
02:04:55,030 --> 02:04:55,810
This is what I learned.

1661
02:04:55,950 --> 02:04:56,210
Oh, wait.

1662
02:04:56,670 --> 02:04:57,370
This is what I learned.

1663
02:04:59,550 --> 02:05:01,290
Okay, I did not expect that to.

1664
02:05:01,510 --> 02:05:01,710
Okay.

1665
02:05:02,330 --> 02:05:03,510
Um, Jeff, I am.

1666
02:05:05,370 --> 02:05:06,190
Jeff, what about...

1667
02:05:06,790 --> 02:05:07,510
Jeff, no.

1668
02:05:07,610 --> 02:05:08,050
Why did you...

1669
02:05:08,070 --> 02:05:23,310
Jeff no why didn't Jeff why did you bring me back what holy

1670
02:05:23,310 --> 02:05:33,990

did you spit me into the other all Jeff

1671
02:05:39,570 --> 02:05:41,670
That's fucked up, bro!

1672
02:05:45,930 --> 02:05:49,930
Bro, I don't, yeah, no, he fucking out of that.

1673
02:05:55,150 --> 02:05:57,030
Okay, that's over.

1674
02:06:01,330 --> 02:06:05,350
Oh, there's no way that, that thing was so fucking deep.

1675
02:06:07,610 --> 02:06:08,530
Oh, I got it on the map.

1676
02:06:10,110 --> 02:06:37,730
taking the portal but where I have one res oh well that is
to that we well I had one res only one yeah

1677
02:06:41,300 --> 02:06:48,480
could play actually wait they don't have wait I could play
oh no I was gonna say, I could play Cloak, but I think

1678
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:50,920
knowing me, I just fucking slam into a penny mine.

1679
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:56,040
Knowing me, that seems like something that's gonna happen to
me.

1680
02:06:58,280 --> 02:06:59,900
Oh, you should, you can take him.

1681
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:00,700
You can take him.

1682
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:01,360
You're Deadpool.

1683
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:03,080
You're the better Deadpool.

1684
02:07:03,260 --> 02:07:04,280
You're so much stronger.

1685
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:09,900
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1686
02:07:11,100 --> 02:07:11,900
We kill him.

1687
02:07:12,700 --> 02:07:14,140
He's literally with our ults.

1688
02:07:14,220 --> 02:07:15,680
Okay, I guess we cannot kill him.

1689
02:07:19,190 --> 02:07:20,610
Alright, never mind.

1690
02:07:25,190 --> 02:07:25,750
Unfortunately.

1691
02:07:28,830 --> 02:07:29,630
It's alright.

1692
02:07:29,970 --> 02:07:30,950
Everything is fine.

1693
02:07:31,490 --> 02:07:33,610
Okay, why do we always double support us though?

1694
02:07:38,660 --> 02:07:39,220
But...

1695
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:40,300
Like, I don't fuck with that.

1696
02:07:44,270 --> 02:07:47,690
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm spitting my orbs
out.

1697
02:07:48,250 --> 02:07:49,630
As fast as I can.

1698
02:07:52,070 --> 02:08:01,290
Alright, maybe we might have to swap, we might have to swap
support, maybe Rocket ain't working.

1699
02:08:01,870 --> 02:08:04,570
Well, I mean, the other, Jeff ain't working for real.

1700
02:08:06,270 --> 02:08:09,790
But like, maybe I could help out.

1701
02:08:10,810 --> 02:08:14,270
Oh my, why do we...

1702
02:08:15,050 --> 02:08:17,430
I mean, I could help out a little more.

1703
02:08:17,630 --> 02:08:18,030
Fuck it.

1704
02:08:21,270 --> 02:08:32,910
in this they banned in are we banned in this I can throw a
dome out

1705
02:08:37,740 --> 02:08:53,780
I fucking knew that was gonna happen I was like the moment I
swapped the cloak I'm gonna run into a mine guys I did say

1706
02:08:53,780 --> 02:08:57,100
the moment I swapped I'm gonna run into the first mine I
see.

1707
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:00,080
This always happens to me.

1708
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:02,760
That's my bad.

1709
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:06,120
I was also sort of looking at chat, so I wasn't looking in
front of me.

1710
02:09:07,980 --> 02:09:09,720
This is looking in front of me.

1711
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:13,240
But I was right.

1712
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,040
Communication right there.

1713
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:20,060
I just don't think this is working.

1714
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:23,860
I don't think like any of this is working.

1715
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:35,940
oh my god i fucking hate that like the delay i don't know
the timing yet for this

1716
02:09:40,270 --> 02:09:43,850
bro can we like push up okay that's fine

1717
02:09:48,070 --> 02:09:50,310
oh my god i just got scared

1718
02:09:58,240 --> 02:09:59,720
oh god wait

1719
02:10:04,690 --> 02:10:07,690
no i think i think our team is cooked guys

1720
02:10:14,290 --> 02:10:15,350
Why are we all that?

1721
02:10:15,390 --> 02:10:16,450
Because I'm doom queuing.

1722
02:10:17,470 --> 02:10:18,190
No, I don't...

1723
02:10:18,190 --> 02:10:19,610
This team...

1724
02:10:19,610 --> 02:10:22,670
This team might be cooked.

1725
02:10:27,250 --> 02:10:29,990
I don't think we can salvage this.

1726
02:10:31,690 --> 02:10:34,050
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

1727
02:10:34,290 --> 02:10:35,730
We are cloak and dagger.

1728
02:10:36,450 --> 02:10:39,890
I don't think anything I pick will save us.

1729
02:10:42,390 --> 02:10:46,470
Wait, is that a...

1730
02:10:46,470 --> 02:10:46,730
Oh.

1731
02:10:48,530 --> 02:10:49,750
Are the only...

1732
02:10:49,750 --> 02:10:50,090
Oh.

1733
02:10:55,350 --> 02:10:55,790
Oh.

1734
02:10:56,670 --> 02:10:57,890
That's tragic.

1735
02:11:15,580 --> 02:11:16,280
Without tie.

1736
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:18,180
30 seconds before you attack.

1737
02:11:18,540 --> 02:11:18,980
Get ready.

1738
02:11:23,550 --> 02:11:26,210
Always feels good going into a fight with you.

1739
02:11:26,670 --> 02:11:27,750
Keep your cool, Frank.

1740
02:11:28,210 --> 02:11:29,010
We're the good guys.

1741
02:11:29,350 --> 02:11:40,430
Phoenix team up Wait, we don't have Phoenix is locked We're
gonna go put their vibes here then Oh

1743
02:11:50,690 --> 02:11:51,930

1744
02:12:02,490 --> 02:12:05,390
Oh my god, we gotta kill oh my god.

1745
02:12:05,470 --> 02:12:14,730

They are okay over there too.

1751
02:13:15,090 --> 02:13:15,530
They are not.

1752
02:13:15,690 --> 02:13:15,950
They are not.

1753
02:13:16,430 --> 02:13:17,770
They are 100% not okay.

1754
02:13:18,150 --> 02:13:19,070
They are not okay.

1755
02:13:19,210 --> 02:13:19,910
They are not okay.

1756
02:13:20,370 --> 02:13:21,790
They are still not okay.

1757
02:13:27,230 --> 02:13:28,950
Yeah, I think I know what I'm avoiding again.

1758
02:13:42,870 --> 02:13:43,890
All right, Nance, we did it.

1759
02:13:44,950 --> 02:13:45,350

02:13:46,830 --> 02:13:47,710
Okay, I made it.

Oh no!

1766
02:14:29,960 --> 02:14:33,540
That is not ideal.

1767
02:14:34,980 --> 02:14:34,980
Oh,

1768
02:14:38,930 --> 02:14:40,090

1769
02:14:40,850 --> 02:14:43,290
Oh, the poor Jeff.

1770
02:14:44,430 --> 02:14:46,230
I saw it live.

1771
02:14:51,710 --> 02:14:52,710
Oh, man.

1772
02:14:54,030 --> 02:14:55,630
That poor Jeff.

1773
02:14:59,190 --> 02:15:09,430

have oh my gosh this guy's playing mystery i will say it

1774
02:15:09,430 --> 02:15:14,690
looks like this guy is playing mystery heroes i don't think
even he knows what he wants to play

1775
02:15:18,530 --> 02:15:26,690

1779
02:15:59,330 --> 02:15:59,650
Okay.

1780
02:16:02,870 --> 02:16:05,650
I don't have anything else, but good luck, everyone.

1781
02:16:07,470 --> 02:16:07,950
Ready?

1782
02:16:09,050 --> 02:16:09,450
All right.

1783
02:16:09,930 --> 02:16:10,730
Good luck, everyone.

1784
02:16:12,370 --> 02:16:15,430
Oh, thank God.

1785
02:16:15,490 --> 02:16:16,070
Oh, thank God.

1786
02:16:16,230 --> 02:16:17,470
He's actually shielding.

1787
02:16:18,350 --> 02:16:20,170
I thought it was over for me.

1788
02:16:24,310 --> 02:16:27,730
Man, if only we had a strange en mag during that.

1789
02:16:28,610 --> 02:16:30,770
You know, that would have been pretty cool.

1790
02:16:30,790 --> 02:16:33,750
I think the game would have definitely been more winnable.

1791
02:16:37,850 --> 02:16:41,770
Maybe this game would have been a lot more winnable if we
weren't solo tanking.

1792
02:16:42,050 --> 02:16:53,090
Oh, just a little theory I have there.

1793
02:16:57,410 --> 02:16:58,550
I don't know.

1794
02:16:58,610 --> 02:16:59,290
Is that wild?

1795
02:16:59,630 --> 02:17:00,690
Is that a wild...

1796
02:17:00,790 --> 02:17:28,850
a pre-assumption where oh um all right that was a stranger
that is a stranger right there i i don't even know what he

1797
02:17:28,850 --> 02:17:44,310
did there you go can't see I got us a very very oral right
there it's just that you know what it looks super fucking

1798
02:17:44,310 --> 02:18:01,250
cool if I only just killed nobody that would be pretty neat
that would be really cool I'm just trying to probably kill

1799
02:18:01,250 --> 02:18:24,310
that oh okay behind you i hope we get rid of that okay we

1804
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:03,760
Confident of your choice.

1805
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:07,240
Then what's the point?

1806
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:14,100

02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:19,600
I'm holding.

1809
02:19:21,360 --> 02:19:21,700
I'm holding.

1810
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:25,660
I've not stopped holding my left.

1811
02:19:28,560 --> 02:19:29,420
BP is 1 HP.

1812
02:19:29,640 --> 02:19:30,180
BP is 1 HP.

1813
02:19:31,240 --> 02:19:32,620
He was not 1 HP.

1814
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:34,100
HP but okay.

1815
02:19:37,020 --> 02:19:39,680
He was not 1 HP but okay.

1816
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:42,460
That was a...

1817
02:19:42,460 --> 02:19:43,940
That was a die.

1818
02:19:47,160 --> 02:19:48,160
Oh my god, no, it's over.

1819
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:50,500
It's over.

1820
02:19:53,320 --> 02:19:54,160
He was...

1821
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:55,380
He was 1 HP now.

1822
02:19:55,500 --> 02:19:56,980
He was 1 HP now.

1823
02:19:58,180 --> 02:19:58,700
I got three.

1824
02:19:59,540 --> 02:20:00,480
He got three.

1825
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:01,380
How?

1826
02:20:01,420 --> 02:20:01,660
How?

1827
02:20:02,980 --> 02:20:03,800
Swap trench.

1828
02:20:04,020 --> 02:20:06,820
Give me a trench.

1829
02:20:06,820 --> 02:20:07,740
Oh, never mind.

1830
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:11,320
We can win this league.

1831
02:20:13,480 --> 02:20:13,920
Don't worry.

1832
02:20:15,140 --> 02:20:15,840
Oh my god.

1833
02:20:16,120 --> 02:20:16,120
Oh.

1834
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:21,840
Oh my, I didn't think he would turn around for me.

1835
02:20:24,380 --> 02:20:26,360
Oh my god, it's because he was chasing the chest.

1836
02:20:26,980 --> 02:20:30,540
I was like, looking at my chat, I was like, oh yeah, I
should be fine.

1837
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:33,680
Oh my god.

1838
02:20:37,240 --> 02:20:38,080
That's my bad.

1839
02:20:38,640 --> 02:20:40,260
You should know what to have to play, man.

1840
02:20:41,140 --> 02:20:43,060
You should know what to play.

1841
02:20:43,740 --> 02:20:43,740
I

1842
02:20:47,220 --> 02:20:51,300
was like, all right, I should be fine.

1843
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:57,120
Okay, this guy.

1844
02:20:57,560 --> 02:20:58,240
Whoa, okay.

1845
02:21:04,120 --> 02:21:04,640
Okay.

1846
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:07,640
Okay, let me, let me have a little boy in this guy.

1847
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:11,080
This guy...

1848
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:13,980
This guy was very confused.

1849
02:21:29,070 --> 02:21:30,630
I avoided...

1850
02:21:31,830 --> 02:21:33,410
I avoided...

1851
02:21:33,410 --> 02:21:34,270
Oh yeah, shit.

1852
02:21:35,110 --> 02:21:36,870
Shit, I avoided...

1853
02:21:36,870 --> 02:21:39,470
I avoided Jeff and...

1854
02:21:40,130 --> 02:21:41,650
Mystery Heroes.

1855
02:21:43,410 --> 02:21:43,950
And...

1856
02:21:43,950 --> 02:21:44,850
Okay, there you go.

1857
02:21:54,430 --> 02:21:55,950
Look at Jutes.

1858
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:26,340
Oh, yeah, one of my friends was like, um, asking if, like,
he could get in touch with the, he could get in touch with

1859
02:22:26,340 --> 02:22:32,840
the Marwa Rival's desk, because he wants to be like, oh, I
can solve all the issues by if you just give me, my company,

1860
02:22:33,100 --> 02:22:36,260
all the third-party organizations for tournaments.

1861
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:39,120
I was like, bro, they will not like that.

1862
02:22:39,220 --> 02:22:41,380
They were not, are not going to go with that, bro.

1863
02:22:42,780 --> 02:22:43,660
I was straight up.

1864
02:22:43,700 --> 02:22:53,900
I was just like, I don't think, um, I don't think they would
give you all the organizations for third-party tournaments.

1865
02:23:00,390 --> 02:23:00,470
Yeah.

1866
02:23:01,370 --> 02:23:04,730
Because he has experience with organizing tournaments for
other games.

1867
02:23:05,190 --> 02:23:06,910
And he's like, I can solve this problem.

1868
02:23:07,210 --> 02:23:13,530
But I think, like, the thing is, the community will be,
like, super mad about that.

1869
02:23:13,950 --> 02:23:15,210
Because it's, like, gatekeeping.

1870
02:23:18,590 --> 02:23:21,190
Bro, wants to be the tempo of Marble Ravos.

1871
02:23:22,030 --> 02:23:28,250
say that because it was tempo that ass

1872
02:23:34,000 --> 02:24:05,920
way I think like people would be mad though because like
because people would be like oh it's gay keeping you know I

1873
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:08,640
can play game but if we need

1874
02:24:19,990 --> 02:24:24,290
pick your hero or villain I'm not judging

1875
02:24:38,330 --> 02:24:59,840
oh triple support time oh is gamut open let's go let's
fucking go I'll play gamut in 20 years time to see if your

1876
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:18,360

get ready i want to show them t gambit and loki what what

1877
02:25:18,360 --> 02:25:29,820

like again t gambit against

1878
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:37,400
English is my first language.

1879
02:25:38,300 --> 02:25:40,180
Okay, that makes sense, yeah.

1880
02:25:40,760 --> 02:25:43,980
I was like, again, I never even met you, bro.

1881
02:25:44,160 --> 02:25:46,020
I've never seen you before my life.

1882
02:25:52,170 --> 02:25:53,590
I'm gonna say, what do you mean again?

1883
02:25:54,130 --> 02:25:54,910
Who are you?

1884
02:26:05,050 --> 02:26:07,150
Oh my god, am I gonna have to waste my...

1885
02:26:07,150 --> 02:26:07,890
Oh my god, dude.

1886
02:26:08,510 --> 02:26:09,830
I have to waste this.

1887
02:26:11,190 --> 02:26:12,650
Just because we are so low.

1888
02:26:12,870 --> 02:26:18,200
It went a hard dive.

1889
02:26:20,440 --> 02:26:21,360
Oh my god.

1890
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:23,300
Everyone needs so much heals.

1891
02:26:26,140 --> 02:26:26,740
Reload.

1892
02:26:29,860 --> 02:26:30,660
Are you like, Gary?

1893
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:34,520
I don't want to show fucking low.

1894
02:26:36,480 --> 02:26:37,460
That sucks.

1895
02:26:37,640 --> 02:26:38,340
I want to do it.

1896
02:26:38,400 --> 02:26:39,880
I want to anti-black hat.

1897
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:41,460
What?

1898
02:26:43,420 --> 02:26:44,500
Oh, that's off.

1899
02:26:46,460 --> 02:26:48,640
That's actually awkward.

1900
02:26:50,900 --> 02:26:51,160
That's actually awkward.

1901
02:26:51,160 --> 02:26:52,160
That's so awkward.

1902
02:26:54,980 --> 02:26:56,660
He copied Star Lord.

1903
02:26:58,320 --> 02:27:01,000
Alright, well, at least we have Gambit on.

1904
02:27:04,660 --> 02:27:07,060
Well, we take, we had two Star Lord olds!

1905
02:27:09,660 --> 02:27:10,340
Alright, I'll wait.

1906
02:27:11,940 --> 02:27:14,860
This sucks because I can't use it, I can't use this
aggressive.

1907
02:27:23,110 --> 02:27:24,970
Okay, we didn't need that, but they'll care.

1908
02:27:27,610 --> 02:27:29,270
We did not need that.

1909
02:27:31,230 --> 02:27:34,550
All right, well, um, we might be fucked.

1910
02:27:35,790 --> 02:27:42,750
We don't have, uh, Mentis ult, oh, and oh, that's awkward.

1911
02:27:44,130 --> 02:27:47,270
We might, we might have a little, oopsie.

1912
02:27:51,770 --> 02:28:03,950
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, you know, it'll be cool that we
had matches out there.

1913
02:28:07,570 --> 02:28:10,790
Wait, this guy can play things other than Jeff?

1914
02:28:11,530 --> 02:28:13,730
Bro, are you fucking?

1915
02:28:14,050 --> 02:28:14,930
Oh, my God.

1916
02:28:15,070 --> 02:28:16,270
No, it's okay.

1917
02:28:16,630 --> 02:28:17,110
It's all right.

1918
02:28:18,610 --> 02:28:24,510
This guy can actually play, like, Can Ashley not play Jeff.

1919
02:28:25,330 --> 02:28:25,930
That's Ashley.

1920
02:28:26,310 --> 02:28:27,170
Oh my god.

1921
02:28:27,290 --> 02:28:29,130
We were solo healing Jeff.

1922
02:28:30,230 --> 02:28:30,230
Like

1923
02:28:34,730 --> 02:28:38,550
Why couldn't he have character development?

1924
02:28:39,290 --> 02:28:42,670
Well, I don't understand.

1925
02:28:44,430 --> 02:28:46,590
Why couldn't he have character development?

1926
02:28:48,610 --> 02:28:49,570
Oh my god.

1927
02:28:49,770 --> 02:28:51,230
I was up in the air.

1928
02:28:51,330 --> 02:28:51,750
So I couldn't.

1929
02:28:51,770 --> 02:28:56,570
right click down like when he was on my team

1930
02:29:00,410 --> 02:29:11,110
why did he cure your development when I was dead all right
it's fine I have load here oh that's unlucky I was gonna see

1931
02:29:11,110 --> 02:29:28,090
I can grab all the way do we ban Jeff is that it oh my god
we must have ban Jeff I did not i did not check let me check

1932
02:29:28,090 --> 02:29:37,570

that's why bro i rather we banned okay i rather we banned

1933
02:29:37,570 --> 02:29:41,090
gambit because then he would be like double support with
jeff and

1934
02:29:47,370 --> 02:29:53,050
they are not wait they're not triple they're not Ripple.

1935
02:30:06,930 --> 02:30:12,590
The battle starts in five, four, three, two, one.

1936
02:30:14,010 --> 02:30:15,950
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

1937
02:30:16,350 --> 02:30:16,790
Got it?

1938
02:30:18,150 --> 02:30:19,990
Oh, I'm like, what the fuck do you mean?

1939
02:30:20,090 --> 02:30:20,550
You have three.

1940
02:30:20,610 --> 02:30:21,330
I was not healing.

1941
02:30:21,570 --> 02:30:23,590
You said you have 3K heals.

1942
02:30:24,150 --> 02:30:25,730
You know, I could have got heals.

1943
02:30:26,170 --> 02:30:27,910
Like what the fuck do you mean?

1944
02:30:27,970 --> 02:30:29,790
He's like, I don't know what's going on.

1945
02:30:29,790 --> 02:30:31,070
I'm only datamish boosted.

1946
02:30:31,130 --> 02:30:38,870
I only have 3k heals That's still heals What do you mean?

1947
02:30:39,610 --> 02:30:45,590
I know what's going on and I'm not healing Like what?

1948
02:30:46,530 --> 02:30:50,910
That's still healing Gambit Loki Gambit Loki

1949
02:30:54,990 --> 02:31:00,470
No, this is like valid crash out He's like Not healing.

1950

I have only three K heals.

1951
02:31:03,550 --> 02:31:05,310
I should have been ambitled.

1952
02:31:06,970 --> 02:31:08,470
There you go.

1953
02:31:12,940 --> 02:31:13,400
Yeah.

1954
02:31:14,380 --> 02:31:14,980
He...

1955
02:31:16,380 --> 02:31:17,440
Go now, go now.

1956
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:22,120
Oh, you copied Mantis, I think.

1957
02:31:22,900 --> 02:31:25,760
Oh, you fucked up copy three, Domer!

1958
02:31:33,590 --> 02:31:36,170
He fucked up copied two times in a row.

1959
02:31:36,590 --> 02:31:37,050
I don't know.

1960
02:31:37,230 --> 02:31:39,470
I don't know how that's possible.

1961
02:31:43,780 --> 02:31:45,420
I don't know how that's possible.

1962
02:31:53,220 --> 02:31:53,920
How did...

1963
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:55,080
Oh my god.

1964
02:32:04,150 --> 02:32:07,770
I don't understand how he copied...

1965
02:32:08,510 --> 02:32:10,250
His current record is...

1966
02:32:10,770 --> 02:32:15,610
I will say his current record is not looking so good right
now.

1967
02:32:16,090 --> 02:32:17,750
When it comes to copying.

1968
02:32:17,770 --> 02:32:24,170
it's it's it's 2-1 right now it is 2-1 for copies

1969
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:36,580

Oh my god, I made it.

02:33:07,930 --> 02:33:10,030
Why is our low key over there?

1975
02:33:10,610 --> 02:33:12,650
I'm so confused!

1976
02:33:15,170 --> 02:33:16,330
Oh my god.

1977
02:33:28,490 --> 02:33:30,030
Oh my god, he's got it!

1978
02:33:30,230 --> 02:33:30,750
He's got the gamble!

1979
02:33:31,130 --> 02:33:31,690
He's got it!

1980
02:33:31,770 --> 02:33:32,190

There we go.

1988
02:34:11,410 --> 02:34:12,630
I agree we don't mid-fight so...

1989
02:34:12,650 --> 02:34:23,580
It's a little like 80% joking before the before you okay.

1990
02:34:24,300 --> 02:34:25,000
I should have just go.

1991

1993
02:34:50,130 --> 02:34:50,590
Go Gambit.

1994
02:34:50,870 --> 02:34:51,430
He has all he has all.

1995
02:34:55,610 --> 02:34:56,770
There we go.

1996
02:34:57,870 --> 02:34:59,470
They're TPing, they're TPing.

1997
02:34:59,630 --> 02:35:00,950
Oh my god, we gotta kill Gambit.

1998
02:35:11,310 --> 02:35:12,550
Holy shit!

1999
02:35:18,640 --> 02:35:20,740
Where do I go?

2000
02:35:21,360 --> 02:35:21,640
Oh

2001
02:35:24,740 --> 02:35:31,520
my god, are we TPing?

2002
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:32,560
Are we TPing?

2003
02:35:32,660 --> 02:35:33,160
We're TPing.

2004
02:35:34,100 --> 02:35:34,440
Wonderful.

2005
02:35:58,180 --> 02:35:58,660
winnable

2006
02:36:06,460 --> 02:36:14,500
hours famous last words what are these lobbies because all
the fucking players are at the g3 tournament I do not

2007
02:36:14,500 --> 02:36:25,180
recognize any of these players I did not recognize any of
these players and everyone is like the vibes ain't it not

2008
02:36:25,180 --> 02:36:29,400
like the you know like playing for the Oh, man, I can't even
say vibes no more, bro.

2009
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:32,680
Zaza ruined vibes, man.

2010
02:36:36,680 --> 02:36:37,200
Like...

2011
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:39,960
Bro, this whole thing ruined vibes.

2012
02:36:40,920 --> 02:36:43,520
Can't even say it for fun no more.

2013
02:36:46,260 --> 02:36:49,500
I just got to the point that it's so overdone, too.

2014
02:36:57,590 --> 02:36:58,850
That's forever tainted.

2015
02:36:58,950 --> 02:37:01,630
I can't even use that word for, like...

2016
02:37:02,550 --> 02:37:04,230
Any other game anymore.

2017
02:37:11,070 --> 02:37:12,130
Oh, seven vibes.

2018
02:37:17,890 --> 02:37:19,030
Oh, the group?

2019
02:37:19,430 --> 02:37:20,630
Who the fuck was my group?

2020
02:37:22,010 --> 02:37:23,510
I don't have enough of wishlocks.

2021
02:37:24,610 --> 02:37:25,390
Where is he?

2022
02:37:32,970 --> 02:37:35,550
They ruin vibes forever.

2023
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:44,760
She literally killed the vibes.

2024
02:37:45,020 --> 02:37:47,200
Like, no, yeah, exactly!

2025
02:37:47,780 --> 02:37:49,220
She killed the vibes!

2026
02:37:51,620 --> 02:37:54,700
I can no longer vibe in peace.

2027
02:37:58,100 --> 02:38:00,080
It's literally gone.

2028
02:38:08,970 --> 02:38:11,310
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

2029
02:38:11,750 --> 02:38:12,870
Very unfortunate.

2030
02:38:24,820 --> 02:38:27,640
Now, who am I going to banish from this match?

2031
02:38:36,190 --> 02:38:37,130
What time is it now?

2032
02:38:37,670 --> 02:38:38,190
140.

2033
02:38:38,790 --> 02:38:39,390
I'll play...

2034
02:38:39,390 --> 02:38:40,390
This might be LG.

2035
02:38:41,370 --> 02:38:41,950
It might be LG.

2036
02:38:42,610 --> 02:38:43,790
Because I do have another stream today.

2037
02:38:43,890 --> 02:38:44,310
I don't want to...

2038
02:38:44,310 --> 02:38:45,050
I want to play zombie.

2039
02:38:45,070 --> 02:38:56,820
these but I'll make the waiting room while we're here yeah
this would be LG what are these lobbies I feel like I'm

2040
02:38:56,820 --> 02:39:00,920
playing with like the most random people that I've never
seen before

2041
02:39:06,420 --> 02:39:15,580
the quarantine game the zombie quarantine game

2042
02:39:23,470 --> 02:39:29,710
you'll need a top-notch team to win this one um what a fuck
do I win this

2043
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:35,700
Let's rock it.

2044
02:39:43,690 --> 02:39:45,590
They already cladding really high.

2045
02:39:45,810 --> 02:39:46,350
Alright, babe.

2046
02:39:47,050 --> 02:39:47,990
Or is the rank reset?

2047
02:39:48,150 --> 02:39:49,370
I'm like, I swear to God.

2048
02:39:49,590 --> 02:39:51,590
Like, I don't recognize anyone anymore.

2049
02:40:01,520 --> 02:40:04,100
I guess like all the everyone else is playing the J3 turn.

2050
02:40:04,200 --> 02:40:04,600
You're right.

2051
02:40:04,940 --> 02:40:06,700
I think everyone's just actually playing it.

2052
02:40:11,370 --> 02:40:11,510
Yeah.

2053
02:40:16,570 --> 02:40:18,710
I saw the office is important.

2054
02:40:18,930 --> 02:40:20,110
I saw that like since the beginning.

2055
02:40:20,210 --> 02:40:23,610
I mean, Eddie is also in Fortnite from Ed, Eddie, and Eddie.

2056
02:40:24,110 --> 02:40:28,730
Um, I just don't think Steve Corel looks really good in
Fortnite.

2057
02:40:29,130 --> 02:40:31,050
I, yeah, that's just my honest opinion.

2058
02:40:31,230 --> 02:40:33,770
I, he just looks like a, just an office.

2059
02:40:33,950 --> 02:40:38,330
Like, I mean, it is the office, but he really just looks
like a regular guy at the office.

2060
02:40:40,830 --> 02:40:49,310
Like, I know, like, that's the whole premise, but, like,
it's just, like, because, like, because it's like, okay,

2061
02:40:49,550 --> 02:40:57,530
because, It's like Dwight has more distinguishable features,
but like Steve Corel, he just...

2062
02:40:57,530 --> 02:41:01,030
It doesn't really look like Steve Corel, you know what I'm
saying?

2063
02:41:02,170 --> 02:41:04,750
Like, it doesn't really look like him.

2064
02:41:05,130 --> 02:41:06,630
But the Dwight one is good.

2065
02:41:06,750 --> 02:41:08,830
I think Dwight was really good.

2066
02:41:13,370 --> 02:41:17,430
Yeah, he is just a dude, but it's just, you know.

2067
02:41:21,370 --> 02:41:28,910
It just doesn't look as funny, you know, when you kill
people with him?

2068
02:41:31,510 --> 02:41:32,790
It just doesn't look that funny.

2069
02:41:33,490 --> 02:41:35,830
But when you get killed by Dwight, that's funny.

2070
02:41:38,130 --> 02:41:39,610
Getting killed by Dwight is funny.

2071
02:41:39,850 --> 02:41:42,750
But getting killed by, like, some random office guy is not
as funny.

2072
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:55,980
I guess you could say, yeah, but it could be like some
random office guy with a gun.

2073
02:41:57,240 --> 02:41:59,420
Just doesn't give the same ha-ha.

2074
02:42:02,220 --> 02:42:04,720
It doesn't give the same ha-ha.

2075
02:42:08,400 --> 02:42:09,000
Burr!

2076
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:10,180
Burr!

2077
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:17,860
Oh my god, protect me, protect me, protect me.

2078
02:42:17,960 --> 02:42:18,400
No!

2079
02:42:23,310 --> 02:42:25,590
I can't believe he flew that far.

2080
02:42:26,350 --> 02:42:28,250
No, I should not have bird.

2081
02:42:28,690 --> 02:42:29,770
They made it halfway!

2082
02:42:31,010 --> 02:42:32,170
That was unlucky.

2083
02:42:32,930 --> 02:42:34,650
I had I burned my last.

2084
02:42:35,370 --> 02:42:42,990
I should have just played a little safer there That was my
bet

2085
02:42:46,590 --> 02:43:02,370
Um, they are I I can't have anything Can't have anything
Like, it's just me!

2086
02:43:02,750 --> 02:43:04,230
No one else is in there!

2087
02:43:05,110 --> 02:43:08,850
I can't have anything.

2088
02:43:20,970 --> 02:43:23,530
Life is just not fair, I guess.

2089
02:43:24,490 --> 02:43:26,750
We went from one hook player to the next.

2090
02:43:28,370 --> 02:43:29,990
What is up with all the hook players?

2091
02:43:30,590 --> 02:43:30,830
Nope.

2092
02:43:31,170 --> 02:43:32,010
That's fine.

2093
02:43:32,130 --> 02:43:34,570
I didn't think that was so ahead, but...

2094
02:43:34,590 --> 02:43:36,190
i wasn't paying attention

2095
02:43:48,870 --> 02:44:01,250
all right oh my god i also don't think hulk is the problem
when we do technically have um we do technically have um you

2096
02:44:01,250 --> 02:44:14,630
know we do technically have um iron fist so i i don't think
hulk is the issue here right about now when there's like a

2097
02:44:14,630 --> 02:44:35,950
lot of things wrong with this it truly is a million things
wrong with us bro like why I got solo on this he was oh my

2099
02:44:51,430 --> 02:44:51,870
Look at this.

2100
02:44:54,350 --> 02:44:57,390
Like, there's a million things wrong with our comp.

2101
02:44:57,570 --> 02:44:59,630
I don't think I am the problem.

2102
02:45:01,810 --> 02:45:04,290
It's like, it's like, I'll play, I'll play cloak.

2103
02:45:05,070 --> 02:45:10,010
Like you can blame, there's so many things that we should
swap, but it's not me.

2104
02:45:10,430 --> 02:45:12,750
Like has nobody said swap off?

2105
02:45:18,450 --> 02:45:19,530
Oh, what the?

2106
02:45:20,550 --> 02:45:20,790
Okay.

2107
02:45:24,820 --> 02:45:27,380
Oh, I swapped out rocket.

2108
02:45:27,420 --> 02:45:28,060
Why are we in that room?

2109
02:45:28,440 --> 02:45:29,380
Bro, what are we doing?

2110
02:45:30,600 --> 02:45:32,660
Oh, I just died.

2111
02:45:40,020 --> 02:45:42,540
There's like so many things wrong.

2112
02:45:49,830 --> 02:45:52,310
Like, clearly their rocket is worth...

2113
02:45:52,310 --> 02:45:55,130
They're playing the same here, their cop as us, too.

2114
02:45:57,950 --> 02:45:58,690
Oh my.

2115
02:45:59,270 --> 02:46:00,170
Why are you fucking kidding?

2116
02:46:00,330 --> 02:46:00,530
Really?

2117
02:46:03,930 --> 02:46:06,150
I didn't think we needed that, but okay.

2118
02:46:07,270 --> 02:46:08,190
Apparently we do.

2119
02:46:12,490 --> 02:46:17,710
I was like, I did not think we needed my ult, but apparently
we do.

2120
02:46:18,450 --> 02:46:18,630
Alright.

2121
02:46:23,200 --> 02:46:26,060
Okay, so I know they have a stream.

2122
02:46:29,240 --> 02:46:29,760
Okay.

2123
02:46:29,760 --> 02:46:29,840
Okay.

2124
02:46:29,860 --> 02:46:31,300
I can't I can't save twice.

2125
02:46:31,640 --> 02:46:33,600
I can't save you all twice.

2126
02:46:34,180 --> 02:46:37,200
I Oh my

2127
02:46:48,740 --> 02:46:49,240

2128
02:46:50,940 --> 02:46:54,180
Okay, I was gonna say I don't have a second fade.

2129
02:46:54,640 --> 02:46:54,640
I

2130
02:46:58,360 --> 02:47:04,020
I was like, guys, I do not have a second fade for that.

2131
02:47:05,340 --> 02:47:08,540
I already saved us from the fucking Thor.

2132
02:47:09,620 --> 02:47:10,820
I can't do it again.

2133
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:11,380
I'm sorry.

2134
02:47:11,400 --> 02:47:11,860
All right.

2135
02:47:16,570 --> 02:47:17,290
All right.

2136
02:47:23,180 --> 02:47:24,560
I think I might have to.

2137
02:47:24,860 --> 02:47:25,040
Yeah.

2138
02:47:28,640 --> 02:47:29,420
All right.

Here we go.

Holy fuck.

2141
02:47:33,420 --> 02:47:34,420
I'm fucking leaving.

2142
02:47:34,680 --> 02:47:35,620
I died enough.

2143
02:47:39,120 --> 02:47:42,780
Well, well, one of us lives at least.

2144
02:47:48,700 --> 02:47:49,440
All right, it's five.

2145
02:47:53,470 --> 02:47:53,750

03:05:49,470 --> 03:05:50,570
That's cool, though.

2345
03:05:52,630 --> 03:05:55,250
That's cool that they flew a lot of people over to test.

2346
03:05:55,350 --> 03:05:57,030
Oh, they flew a lot of Apex players.

2347
03:05:57,130 --> 03:06:00,990
I guess because, like, it was made by, like, Apex players.

2348
03:06:01,230 --> 03:06:02,270
Not Apex devs.

2349
03:06:02,490 --> 03:06:06,710
So they flew a lot of Apex players over to check it out.

2350
03:06:07,950 --> 03:06:11,590
I mean, there's a lot of endorsements about it right now.

2351
03:06:16,600 --> 03:06:17,040
Yeah.

2352
03:06:26,820 --> 03:06:37,420
Oh, I think it's also because I might have like you know my
reaction wasn't very positive but I will eat my words when

2353
03:06:37,420 --> 03:06:50,300
we got the to be fair I was looking forward to Titanfall 2
maybe because my reaction wasn't very positive I don't think

2354
03:06:50,300 --> 03:06:56,580
they would have invited me because they've been a lot of
small but to be fair I expected Titanfall

2355
03:07:01,360 --> 03:07:09,040
hey if kai kai is actually really fucking good i will eat my
words i'll i'll be like damn i'm sorry for doubting you i i

2356
03:07:09,040 --> 03:07:19,300
i i treat titan fall 2 as titan fall 1 um because it is the
better game but like now now that i know it's like better

2357
03:07:19,300 --> 03:07:28,920

it a bit during like scrims um let's scream i don't remember

2407
03:11:58,560 --> 03:12:07,660
i leaked it a bit i i list some though a little bit um but
it's basically content creators are the captains and then

2408
03:12:07,660 --> 03:12:22,760
they assign two pro players for each um they assign two pros
for each team for the captain so the only issue i uh oh he

2409
03:12:22,760 --> 03:12:32,900
doesn't have an account okay it's okay we chill now pop um
all right All right.

2410
03:12:33,100 --> 03:12:34,660
Oh, he doesn't have an account.

03:12:35,100 --> 03:12:35,400
All right.

2412
03:12:39,740 --> 03:12:41,140
It's all right.

2413
03:12:42,320 --> 03:12:45,620
It was either play a bit more or we relax.

2414
03:12:46,220 --> 03:12:46,320
All right.

2415
03:12:46,760 --> 03:12:47,780
Apparently I'm too low.

2416
03:12:50,420 --> 03:12:51,240
And what does that say?

2417
03:12:51,800 --> 03:12:55,380
Um, it's like they're assigned two pros for each team.

2418
03:12:55,560 --> 03:12:57,080
But then what the fuck?

2419
03:12:57,220 --> 03:12:57,700
Okay.

2420
03:12:59,280 --> 03:13:01,220
Fogger lied a little bit to me.

2421
03:13:01,240 --> 03:13:10,840
He said it's just most it's gonna be like like content
creators around my level I was like ah, that's cool.

2422
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:23,060
I fuck with that like I guess I was like I feel I feel weird
like being like a captain because I uh feel weird Being

2423
03:13:23,060 --> 03:13:34,720
captain because like you know my skill level Yeah, I'm like
to fight around just a little white lie just

2424
03:13:39,160 --> 03:13:48,500
look his examples he gave me was big puffer and big puffer
and flats and i was like oh yeah that's like around my level

2425
03:13:48,500 --> 03:13:57,580
we don't play that often um as much as like like the main
main i'm like yeah and then i see like and then instantly

2426
03:13:57,580 --> 03:14:02,900
and i see the other new captain and i was like wait a minute

2427
03:14:06,770 --> 03:14:14,430

creators flat's like played every day does he play every day

2428
03:14:14,430 --> 03:14:30,570
now I know he like does variety a bit he got me real good he
really did I fell for it again a word because I was like um

2429
03:14:32,190 --> 03:14:42,850

sign pro player It's like okay I fuck with that

2432
03:14:56,590 --> 03:15:04,570
I do be fair Half of the captains Half of the captains are
around my level And the other half of the captains are like

2433
03:15:04,570 --> 03:15:13,870
they might be really good they might be half is like my
level and half is like really good like they're sort of

2434
03:15:13,870 --> 03:15:22,250
they're also like half contact creators have have like you
know play at really high levels so but Joki fell for it

2435
03:15:22,250 --> 03:15:30,130
again she fell for it again

2436
03:15:34,610 --> 03:15:40,810

because it's like 50 50.

2437
