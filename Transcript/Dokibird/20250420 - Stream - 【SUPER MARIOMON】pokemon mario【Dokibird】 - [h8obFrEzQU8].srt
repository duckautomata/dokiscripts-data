1
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,080
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,140
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:21,620
Oh my god, I'm like... I'm like so... I'm so emotional right now because 30 minutes before... 30 minutes before the stream was about to start, I decided to watch a video that was in my recommended for like a week now, and then I was like, oh, this video got to a million views within a week.

4
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,940
Oh, that's interesting.

5
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,380
Maybe I'll finally watch it.

6
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,900
I have 30 minutes to spare.

7
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,080
And I watched it, and I was tearing up.

8
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,280
I was like, no!

9
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,220
I have to stream in two minutes!

10
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,040
What is that?

11
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,780
I thought it would be a funny, interesting, ha-ha video!

12
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,380
Not like an emotional video!

13
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,280
It's not fair!

14
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:59,920
So, because, um, you know, it was a really good video, and I got really emotional about it, I am here to send it to you guys, so you guys can be really emotional about it too.

15
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,580
Because if I have to be, like, if this happens, if this has to affect me, I want it to affect everybody.

16
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:21,360
Um, basically, it's about this guy that decided, um, what he does is that his channel is that he goes through, like, he plays dead games, and just, like, just to see, like, what it's like.

17
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,200
So, there's a game called There.com, and I've never heard about it before, because it's, like, before my time.

18
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,260
Um, but it's basically, like, one of the first... it's basically before Second Life.

19
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,160
So, you guys know what Second Life is?

20
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,500
Um, it's, it's basically that, but it was before Second Life.

21
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:47,940
So, um, it was basically, like, a social media, uh, multiplayer game, where you just walk around and, like, talk to people, hang out with people, build a home there, and all of that.

22
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:55,700
Yeah, and, uh, and then there's, like, in-game voice chat as well, where you can talk to people, and, like, you know, type to people, and everything.

23
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,580
And apparently, it was really popular back in the day, and it's still running to the... but it's still running.

24
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,860
Like, you can still join it.

25
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:09,820
The only issue is that it has a membership fee, and that's why there's not a lot of people playing it now, because, like, Second Life is free.

26
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:17,580
But There.com has, like, a $10 subscription fee each month, but it's still alive in a way that there's still...

27
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:26,740
Apparently, there's, like, at least, like, 50 people that's still playing this game, because they've been in the game for, like, 10 plus years.

28
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,040
Because the game was around since 2003.

29
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:39,840
And, um, and there's some people there that's been in there since 2003, or, like, you know, and, you know, they made a lot of friends there.

30
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,060
They, like, you know, they made a lot of friends.

31
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,860
They made, like, uh, they, like, uh, bonded with a lot of people.

32
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,620
There's a lot of memories associated with it.

33
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,780
So, they're still playing.

34
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,800
They're still paying that $10 a month every, every month.

35
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,120
Uh, which is crazy to think about, like, the amount of money they've, like, invested in it.

36
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:06,680
And then there's, like, and then when you have houses in this game, uh, you have to pay, also pay an additional subscription fee as well.

37
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:14,320
So, the fact that these people are paying so much every month for around 18 plus years is actually insane.

38
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:21,660
But, like, the amount of memories that they share together and, like, the bonds they have is, like, they're, like, such a tight-knit group.

39
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,380
Like, they host events and everything every week.

40
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,940
And every week there's, like, events and stuff for the remaining players that are still there.

41
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,560
And I was watching it.

42
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,040
I was like, oh, my God.

43
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,300
And they're all close, close to each other.

44
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,160
It's like a little family.

45
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,020
Oh, my God.

46
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,750
And I, honestly, I highly recommend watching this video.

47
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,590
Oh, my God.

48
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,230
It's such, it's a really good video.

49
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,250
Um, it's such a good video.

50
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,710
And I was reading the comments, too.

51
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,470
And they're, like, oh, my God.

52
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,370
Like, oh, the memories.

53
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,070
Like, oh, it's so cool that you, like, you know, put a spotlight on this and everything.

54
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,870
And, oh, it's really sweet.

55
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,690
Um, yeah, it's, like, 20.

56
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,270
Yeah, they've been, like, some people have been playing this for 22 years.

57
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,630
They're, like, yeah, I, like, watched your kids grow up from this game.

58
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:18,950
And, like, um, and, like, this is, like, uh, like, I've, like, visited.

59
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,410
I've met a lot of these players in real life.

60
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,550
And this is, like, our way of, like, still talk, like, hang out with each other.

61
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,930
Even though we're, like, we live, like, from different places in the world.

62
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,830
And stuff like that.

63
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,790
I, I, just watch the video, honestly.

64
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,070
What I'm seeing is, does not, like, live up to, like, the actual video itself.

65
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,130
It was so emotional.

66
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,710
And I'm, like, coming into this game.

67
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,910
And I was, like, I was supposed to play Hihi HaHa Super Mario Bat.

68
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,370
And now, like, I feel, I have so much feelings in me right now.

69
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:55,590
I, I have, I have so much feelings.

70
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,110
Watch the video after the stream.

71
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:01,630
Anyway.

72
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,270
Uh, also, like, I need you guys to know, yesterday, I was so tired.

73
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:14,630
I was not, okay, I don't know why, but yesterday was, I had to, you know how I had to read a lot yesterday from all the games I was playing?

74
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,130
Um, from, like, Promise Mascot Agency.

75
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,350
And also, I guess, like, well, I didn't have to read for Friday Night Funk and Team Fortress 2.

76
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,690
But, I didn't read a lot yesterday.

77
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,110
And my brain was so fucking tired.

78
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,770
I actually, like, I went straight to bed right after.

79
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,730
I was not okay.

80
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,250
I was just, like, sleep time.

81
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:38,370
I was just, uh, reading made my brain eepy.

82
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,430
And I just went straight to sleep.

83
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,570
And I woke up at, like, fucking 7 in the morning.

84
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,490
And you know what I did at 7 in the morning?

85
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,290
I played Marvel.

86
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,510
Because I was just like...

87
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,550
Because I wanted to check out the new season.

88
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,710
And I'll just, and see, like, what it's like.

89
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,110
And I'll say, I'll, um, I'll say right now.

90
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,610
Um, I am definitely not gonna play this new season a lot.

91
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,950
Because it is dive meta for the newest season.

92
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,630
Because they basically, uh, buffed all the dive characters.

93
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,710
And then nerfed the anti-dive characters.

94
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,030
So, like, so, um, like, there's barely any support players anymore.

95
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,430
There's no!

96
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,390
There's no, there's no support players.

97
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,090
Because I was playing, I was, I was stacking, right?

98
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,750
And literally, I was literally the only person that was willing to play support.

99
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,710
Um, in the, because I was the only support main.

100
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,490
While I was, like, queuing up.

101
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:43,350
And, like, it almost, like, I think I had one game where there were two support players.

102
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,830
Including me.

103
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,330
And then every other game was just me being the singular support main.

104
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,790
And everybody else was just feeling to play support.

105
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,670
Um, and...

106
00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:01,810
So, like, the reason why I'm saying that, like, playing support right now really fucking sucks, by the way.

107
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:17,690
Because, um, because when you get Dovan by Venom, Spider-Man, Captain America, Psylocke, uh, Black Panther, uh, Iron Fist, uh, The list goes on.

108
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,830
Uh, there is nothing you can do but die.

109
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,430
Like, it does not matter how well I fucking play.

110
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,470
I even had, uh, the other, I would look at the other support, we will heal each other.

111
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,890
I will use the, if I have an Iron Fist, I will use the Iron Fist C ability to, to, like, get HP.

112
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,650
I still die.

113
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,330
Me and the other support will have 10 plus deaths together.

114
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,050
And then, like, the rest of the team will be, like, 5 or 6.

115
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,590
And then me and my other support will be 10 plus deaths.

116
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,890
And it doesn't matter what character we play.

117
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,770
We will just die.

118
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:05,090
And the worst part is that, the, the worst part is that, then you're like, oh, Doki, just go Loki.

119
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,850
You know what the dive characters do?

120
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,550
They bad Loki.

121
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,050
You know what they do, the enemy team?

122
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,950
They bad Loki.

123
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,130
So there's nothing we can do.

124
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:40,490
And, and, and, and, so, um, so, also, the fact that, um, um, they all, the other thing they did was that, um, SR gains is now performance-based, but they forgot to create an algorithm for supports.

125
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,410
For, for SR gains.

126
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,470
So if you're a DPS or a tank, you get plus 30.

127
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,510
If you're a support, you get, like, plus 20.

128
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,230
If you're, if you do really, really well on support, you get plus 20.

129
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:02,910
And then you lose, like, you can lose 25 to 29 points.

130
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:08,810
Because, especially, like, you know how people are, like, oh, yeah, people are, like, oh, Rocket's actually really, really good now.

131
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:15,850
No one wants to play Rocket, because, because, um, like, people who actually want to climb don't really want to play Rocket.

132
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,030
Because Rocket has the most dogshit SR gains.

133
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,450
Because you don't do damage on Rocket.

134
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:27,910
But the SR gains, they calculate, for everyone, is healing and damage.

135
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:39,110
So, like, you know, you have to actually do damage to be able to, like, have higher performance-based SR.

136
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,150
So, like, so, like, you don't win.

137
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:53,130
And, like, that's just, I was, I had a game where I literally did the most healing on my, on both tees.

138
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,350
And we lost.

139
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,210
And I got minus 29.

140
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,910
I was like, what the fuck?

141
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,250
I got minus 29?

142
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:12,230
I was like, and then I got the most healing out of both tees.

143
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,510
I was like, oh my god.

144
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:25,170
But, yeah, um, Rivals is not really fun right now for support players, because there's just, there's no peel.

145
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,290
There's no character you can play that can, you know, as a support.

146
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:35,470
You'd literally have to, like, have half your team come backwards and peel for you to survive.

147
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,910
Like, even if you and the other support work together to, like, heal each other, we still die.

148
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:46,070
Like, we, we can't out-heal all the damage, because there's, like, at least three people trying to fucking kill me.

149
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,690
So, so, support players right now are, like, a dying breed at the moment.

150
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,950
And I'm not gonna lie, I'm not having fun playing Rivals.

151
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,830
I was playing, I played a couple of games, and I was so mentally exhausted playing Marvel Rivals.

152
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:10,870
Like, I actually was, like, even though, like, I wasn't in, like, VC or anything, I was just playing a game and just, like, just trying to see what the season's like now that the meta has settled.

153
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,830
And then I was literally, like, I was so mad.

154
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,130
I went straight to back to bed.

155
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,250
I was so fucking tired.

156
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,770
I was like, sleep time!

157
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,060
Exhausted!

158
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,020
I was like, alright, I'm E.P.

159
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,340
now.

160
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:26,980
Sleep time!

161
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,220
So, yeah, it's just not fun right now.

162
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,120
But, yeah, that's, like, more like a life update at the moment.

163
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:38,840
Alright!

164
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,520
So, today, today we are gonna be playing Super Mario Man!

165
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,820
Um, it is a, it is a ROM, it's a ROM hack, right?

166
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,540
Is that what it's called?

167
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,380
I've never, like, played these types of games before.

168
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:03,100
Um, but it's basically a fan-made ROM hack of, uh, of, you know, Super Mario, if it's Pokemon.

169
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,900
That's basically it.

170
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,200
Um, and it was made by Alpharad.

171
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,860
So, like, it was in development for, I believe, three years now.

172
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,080
And, uh, apparently it's, like, very well-made.

173
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,800
It's an incredibly well-made ROM hack.

174
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,040
And it is funded by one of the, you know, biggest YouTubers on the platform.

175
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,760
And, um, it looked really interesting.

176
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,960
I saw, like, Kony playing a little bit of it.

177
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,880
And it seemed incredibly interesting.

178
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,300
There seems to be a lot of love put into the game itself.

179
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:41,620
Uh, the last time I played Pokemon, like, I kept saying, I said this before, but the last time I played, like, the traditional Pokemon games, the formulaic ones, um, was when Pokemon X and Y was first released.

180
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,320
And for those who are, like, oh, man, that's not long ago.

181
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,480
Let me pull up the year X and Y was first released.

182
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,420
Pokemon X and Y was released in 2013, guys.

183
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,440
You're, like, oh, that's not long ago.

184
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,140
It was released in 2013.

185
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,100
And that was at...

186
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,420
And that was 12 years ago.

187
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,940
So, that was the very last time I played a traditional formulaic Pokemon game.

188
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,820
I never even finished Pokemon X and Y either.

189
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,660
Like, I stopped at the city where it was, like, based off of Paris.

190
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,760
I stopped at there where they had the Elfo Tower and everything.

191
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,000
Because, like I said, I was never really...

192
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,820
I never really liked...

193
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,260
Uh, like, I...

194
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,760
I got...

195
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,260
It got boring.

196
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,920
It got really boring and the games got incredibly easy.

197
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,320
So, like, I never really enjoyed the newer...

198
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,580
Like, the newer games because it felt like there was never anything sort of different.

199
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,580
I do still enjoy Pokemon designs and, like, other types of Pokemon media.

200
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,160
Like, the, um, the Legends games.

201
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,720
But I don't really enjoy the formulaic ones.

202
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,720
The, like, the traditional formula Pokemon anymore.

203
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,320
Just because I think it's been...

204
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,780
It's just really boring at that point for me.

205
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,620
For me, I just find it boring because I've been playing it for a long time.

206
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,160
And, um...

207
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,780
And it just doesn't interest me as much as it did in the past.

208
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,260
I don't know if it's just me growing up or I just, like...

209
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,580
Or I'm just, like, too used to the formula that...

210
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,160
That, uh...

211
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,240
That I wasn't, like, really much into.

212
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,680
Like, I just wanted something new to play.

213
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,160
Um...

214
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,760
Uh, so, yeah.

215
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,920
Uh, so, I heard a lot of good things about Super Mario 1.

216
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,780
And I'm really excited to try it out.

217
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,740
Uh, Tyrena, thank you for the Super Chat.

218
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,700
Thank you, thank you.

219
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,820
Jokey, now you're in the reading mood.

220
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,080
Wanna miss out on the flavor of the month...

221
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,240
Uh, coffin of, um, Andrew Ashley one.

222
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:34,980
What?

223
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,520
What the fuck is that?

224
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,540
Is that the...

225
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,180
Is that the incest game?

226
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,600
Is that...

227
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,920
Is that the game with the incest?

228
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:48,900
Yeah.

229
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,300
That was not flavor of the month.

230
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:52,640
That...

231
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,500
Wasn't that last year?

232
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,460
How did it become flavor of the month again?

233
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,400
I thought that was last year.

234
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,720
Thank you for the Super Chat.

235
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,760
Thank you, thank you.

236
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,440
Alright.

237
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,800
Thank you for the Super Chat.

238
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,640
Thank you, thank you.

239
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,920
This is why I should play more mutants.

240
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,160
Just say you love...

241
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,160
I'd rather...

242
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,740
You can't change my prejudice.

243
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,780
Thank you for the Super Chat.

244
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,160
In fact, I should hate them more because of Dive Meta.

245
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,080
You know who was involved in the...

246
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,020
In the Dive?

247
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,200
Psylocke.

248
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,320
Thank you for the Super Chat.

249
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,740
Thank you, thank you.

250
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,880
Um, Lolly, thank you for the Super Chat.

251
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,760
Thank you, thank you.

252
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,560
Izzy, thank you for the Super Chat.

253
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,580
Thank you, thank you.

254
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,300
Uh, the Eternals...

255
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:32,480
Oh, wait.

256
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,340
Money for Age of Ultron.

257
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,020
Lord Kurosis, thank you for the Super Chat.

258
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,740
Thank you, thank you.

259
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,540
Hey, Toki.

260
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,580
Today is Zekra's birthday.

261
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,120
I was hoping you could wish him a happy birthday.

262
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,080
Of course I can.

263
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,940
Happy birthday to you.

264
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,740
Happy birthday to you.

265
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,680
Happy birthday, dear Zekra.

266
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,400
Happy birthday to you.

267
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,460
Yeah, happy birthday!

268
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,360
Alright.

269
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:53,620
Let's...

270
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,840
I wonder if I can...

271
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,660
Does the controller work on this?

272
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:57,960
I don't know.

273
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,860
Alright, let's see.

274
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,300
I don't know.

275
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,820
Wait, does the Xbox controller work?

276
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,100
For Mario Kart?

277
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,300
Okay, let me look at controls.

278
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,840
Uh, yeah?

279
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,380
Oh, maybe do I have to re-plug it?

280
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,600
Or do I have to boot it up with the controller plugged?

281
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440
Oh no, I got it.

282
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,720
I figured it out.

283
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,520
Okay.

284
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,270
I don't... Hello?

285
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,490
Oh, it's not plugged in.

286
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,510
Oh, I have to set it up.

287
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,250
Okay, guys.

288
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,150
Guys, I'm figuring it out.

289
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:33,470
Alright.

290
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,490
Uh...

291
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,230
Where the fuck is the controller?

292
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,410
Uh...

293
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,590
Okay, I thought I had everything set up, but apparently...

294
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,110
Guys, I'm new to this, guys.

295
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,650
I'm very new to this.

296
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,490
Okay, controller.

297
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,490
Okay, so...

298
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,570
How do I set this?

299
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:52,750
Okay.

300
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,010
That's A, B.

301
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,970
Alright, there you go.

302
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,190
Okay, I did it.

303
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,010
Okay, I set it up.

304
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,430
Alright, I figured it out.

305
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,170
Oh, I have to restart the emulator.

306
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,170
Okay, uh...

307
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,750
Let me reset this.

308
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,690
Alright, Super Mario Man.

309
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,190
Alright, I did it.

310
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,610
I figured it out.

311
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,490
Alright, here we go.

312
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:20,310
Yeah!

313
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,410
Yeah!

314
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,910
Alright, let me know if sounds okay, too.

315
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:24,610
Alright.

316
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,630
New game.

317
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:31,670
Difficulty...

318
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,650
Wait, what...

319
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,470
What can...

320
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,650
This feature is not support...

321
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,130
Then why...

322
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,210
Why am I looking at it?

323
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,530
Why show it to me?

324
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,410
If it's...

325
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:42,710
If...

326
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,690
If I can't...

327
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,190
Level cap off...

328
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,150
Oh, over leveling.

329
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,610
Oh my god, they can be like above level 100?

330
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,110
Okay, that's cool.

331
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,870
Any trainers are their default?

332
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,650
Plus capped at your highest level?

333
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,650
Okay, default, party limit.

334
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,270
Oh, I can like...

335
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,530
Have like more stuff.

336
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,850
Okay, trainer EVs.

337
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,050
I...

338
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,490
I never know what to do with EVs.

339
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,150
I...

340
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:05,310
I...

341
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,890
I don't understand EVs.

342
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:08,970
Um...

343
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:09,530
Wait.

344
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,170
Nuzlocke.

345
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,110
No Luzlocke, guys.

346
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,610
We are...

347
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,570
I would like to have...

348
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,490
Um...

349
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,070
I would like to have my...

350
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,690
Uh...

351
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,250
My Pokemon alive.

352
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,710
Thank you very much.

353
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,230
Uh...

354
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,530
If that is possible.

355
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,510
I'd like them...

356
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,130
I'd like them to be alive, guys.

357
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,270
Oh, it's the Luigi Professor.

358
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,550
The...

359
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,950
The Haunted Mansion.

360
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:35,990
Ah!

361
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:36,770
Finally!

362
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:37,690
A connection!

363
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,290
Nice to meet you.

364
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,370
I'm Professor Elven Dad.

365
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,950
But you can just call me E-Gag.

366
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,170
If you're out of shortening...

367
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,310
Of a shortening mind.

368
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,230
Now then, young fella.

369
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,130
Let me tell you about the world of the Mushroom...

370
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:54,490
Kingdom.

371
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,610
I was like, Mushroom?

372
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,330
Here's a Denison of the Mushroom Kingdom.

373
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,570
As a creature of the Mushroom Kingdom...

374
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,330
You'll be seeing many of these...

375
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,890
Throughout your adventure.

376
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,650
While they're usually the hostile sort...

377
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,690
You'll be getting very familiar with...

378
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,270
Yeah, it's Abu!

379
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,250
Why is that?

380
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,750
Oh ho ho!

381
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,430
You'll be finding out shortly.

382
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,870
Don't worry about that.

383
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,350
What?

384
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,710
Now then, allow me to introduce some fun young lads.

385
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,290
Oh my god!

386
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,630
These two are called Mario and Luigi.

387
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,570
They are the unlikely plumber heroes of the Mushroom Kingdom.

388
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,930
You'll be experiencing this journey through the eyes of Mario.

389
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,610
But what's your...

390
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:47,970
No!

391
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,570
I don't wanna be Mario!

392
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,790
I wanna be Luigi!

393
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,890
It's the year of Luigi!

394
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,590
Yes, you!

395
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,790
The one reading this!

396
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,090
Aww!

397
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,610
I'm sad.

398
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,910
Why do I have to be Mario?

399
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,470
You know like...

400
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,570
Nintendo almost went bankrupt because...

401
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,890
The year of Luigi did not make any money!

402
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,510
The year...

403
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,330
Oh my god!

404
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,020
I almost went...

405
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,580
Doki...

406
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,700
Doki...

407
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,680
Um...

408
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,360
Um...

409
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,040
But the year of Luigi did not make them any money.

410
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,020
So like...

411
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:23,900
Uh...

412
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,700
So...

413
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,620
That's crazy.

414
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,220
So they stopped doing stuff like that.

415
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:27,500
Yeah.

416
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,440
Uh...

417
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,160
Unrelated but true!

418
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,860
Ha ha ha ha!

419
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,540
Alright.

420
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,720
So they don't do much for Luigi anymore because of it.

421
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,620
So it's Doki?

422
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,400
Wait, no.

423
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:42,440
Wait.

424
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,300
Okay.

425
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,560
Do I have to...

426
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,960
Oh, I have to do this.

427
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,420
I wanna say Doki Bird.

428
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,440
I wanna just be Doki.

429
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,260
I was like, no.

430
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,420
Ha ha ha ha!

431
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,660
No, I'm not Doki.

432
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,100
Uh...

433
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,960
Doki...

434
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,620
Wait, does it fit?

435
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,820
Oh, it didn't even fit!

436
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,500
Nevermind.

437
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,660
Doki-o.

438
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,320
Ha ha ha!

439
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,540
Okay, yeah.

440
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,120
Doki-o!

441
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:06,940
Louie!

442
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,560
I'm Doki-o.

443
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,600
I'm Doki-o.

444
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,840
Yeah, it's Doki-o.

445
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,720
It's-a me, Doki-o.

446
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,900
So you're Doki-o, eh?

447
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,360
We...

448
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,860
Well met then, Doki-o.

449
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,720
Alrighty, are you ready?

450
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,220
It's time to venture out into the Mushroom Kingdom.

451
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,400
Make sure to come see me in Toad Town.

452
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,400
I'm sad.

453
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,680
Why can't I be Luigi?

454
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:36,880
Luigi!

455
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,000
I just wanna be Luigi!

456
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,900
Oh, I can like...

457
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,960
Okay, I need to rebu- Guys, I need to rebuy all this.

458
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,960
Oh wait, there's a mushroom!

459
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,940
Wait, do I have a mushroom?

460
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,480
Oh my god!

461
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
Oh my god!

462
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,060
Oh, I love the music!

463
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,920
Oh, I love the music!

464
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,760
I love the music already.

465
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,180
I love it so much.

466
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,340
Alright, I need to fix the...

467
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,020
Let me fix the controllers real quick.

468
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,140
Cause...

469
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,740
Uh...

470
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,780
I do not like the...

471
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,340
I set it up incorrectly.

472
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,220
It should be...

473
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,940
I set it up incorrectly there.

474
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:35,880
Bum...

475
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,160
Bum...

476
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,280
Bum...

477
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,340
Ba-da-da dum...

478
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,040
Bum...

479
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,860
Bum...

480
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:41,860
Bum...

481
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,020
Bum...

482
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,780
오...

483
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,780
I love the music!

484
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,740
Okay, i'll turn it...

485
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,100
I know that you said turn it down.

486
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:47,340
No!

487
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,180
A little bit, I'm sad.

488
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,720
Alright.

489
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,420
No!

490
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,880
Remember the sad times as much as the good times.

491
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,340
Tell everyone you love them.

492
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,120
Bad news.

493
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,420
Luigi!

494
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,720
Good morning, Mario!

495
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,440
Did you sleep well?

496
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,160
Still a little groggy?

497
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,900
Why don't you grab a mushroom from the fridge to get the day started?

498
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,840
That's my Luigi accent.

499
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,580
Mario!

500
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,560
Um, excuse me, it's Red Luigi.

501
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,720
Alright, I gotta get a mushroom.

502
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,960
Yeah, I got a mushroom!

503
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,100
Luigi!

504
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,000
Mail call!

505
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:43,460
Huh?

506
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,320
I'll get it, Mario!

507
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,080
Free mushroom, yeah!

508
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,800
Alright, turn the music down.

509
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,520
Let me know if it's better.

510
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,040
But, um...

511
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,320
It's a letter from Princess Peach.

512
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,320
How about I read it to you, okay?

513
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,520
Thank you, brother.

514
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,440
Dear Mario and Luigi.

515
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,480
I am hosting a worldwide party with help from Professor E.

516
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,620
Gag and friends from other kingdoms.

517
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,160
It should be a fun time with a prize again.

518
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,260
Oh my god, I'm gonna get my cake!

519
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,300
It will be over shortly to explain more.

520
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,340
Have fun!

521
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm a simple Italian.

522
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,260
I'll come over as long as there's cake.

523
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,120
Signed, the princess!

524
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,180
This sounds super exciting, bro!

525
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,340
Let's meet the professor!

526
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,500
Tokyo has simple pleasures.

527
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,680
Tokyo just wants cake.

528
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,340
Luigi has become your partner.

529
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,060
Alright, Luigi.

530
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,320
Let's go meet my girlfriend.

531
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:49,600
Yahoo!

532
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:51,880
Alright.

533
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,980
I hope she makes lots of spaghetti.

534
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,860
Alright, that's my house.

535
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,880
Oh, that's my house!

536
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,600
Oh my god!

537
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,600
Those are the blocks!

538
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Alright, boy.

539
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,720
Let's get going.

540
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,720
Once we get through here, we'll be in Toad Town.

541
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,280
It should take no time at all.

542
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,180
Wait!

543
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,540
Who's that?

544
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,480
Professor E!

545
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,180
Gagged!

546
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,020
We were just on our way to Toad Town to see you.

547
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,340
What's up with the letter the princess sent us?

548
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,460
Patience, my friend.

549
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,300
I'm a bit out of breath from running here and I'm also old.

550
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,200
What is it, bro?

551
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:36,820
Whew!

552
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,720
Okay.

553
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,620
I was going to wait for you two to arrive in Toad Town before I explained.

554
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,900
But then I remembered this path was here.

555
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,900
I can't have you stomping on Koopas and Goombas and the such who are participating in the game.

556
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,760
That's Mama Luigi to you, Tokyo.

557
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,320
I was thinking of the super chat.

558
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:58,780
Thank you.

559
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,520
Thank you.

560
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:07,440
Now then, today, by request of the princess, I will be introducing you two to the Cap Challenge.

561
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,980
The Cap Challenge?

562
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,400
It's a game that has you build a party of allies or captures to battle each other.

563
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,600
Like baseball.

564
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:17,340
Like baseball.

565
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,540
Yes, Luigi.

566
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,880
Just like...

567
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,360
Okay.

568
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,960
I don't think that's like baseball.

569
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:22,940
Like...

570
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,160
I just think he's like, yes.

571
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:24,760
Yes.

572
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,540
Definitely.

573
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,780
Like baseball.

574
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,720
Let's go ahead and get you and your brother started.

575
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,020
Luigi.

576
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,260
I don't think it's like baseball, Luigi.

577
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,220
Behind me is a piranha plant, a bob-bomb, and a blue bear.

578
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,900
Species such as these are an integral part of the event the princess is putting on.

579
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:50,980
I can only give a brief rundown here, but the princess will be explaining more at her castle.

580
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,220
Why should we play, professor?

581
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,080
If not, because it will be lots of fun.

582
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,600
But because the winners will be granted a wish.

583
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,160
Did you hear that, Mario?

584
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,160
A wish.

585
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:10,500
But what do the piranha plants and others have to do with this, professor?

586
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,680
I'm glad you asked, Luigi.

587
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,000
Contensors will be splitting themselves into two categories.

588
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,840
Those who command and those who move.

589
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:27,080
You'll be competing in battles of strategy, utilizing your capture's attacks called moves.

590
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,760
Here, the best way to learn is to just jump right into it.

591
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,680
Go ahead.

592
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,500
Pick whichever one you like.

593
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,500
You will go ahead and choose first, bro.

594
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,780
I don't mind.

595
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,380
Oh, you're trying to fuck me up, Luigi.

596
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,960
You're gonna choose my exact counter, aren't you, bro?

597
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,300
You want that- You want my princess.

598
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,160
I can tell, Luigi.

599
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,740
You have Daisy and her elephant.

600
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:58,300
That guy that's so fucking obsessed with Daisy and her elephant form.

601
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,700
You want the fire- Oh, wait, but ba-bomb is fire though, guys.

602
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,700
Okay, there is a blooper.

603
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,120
All right, do we get blooper or ba-bomb?

604
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,220
We don't do grass types in this household.

605
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,360
We are anti-grass here.

606
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,500
We are not touching any grass.

607
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,420
Ba-bomb or blooper, guys?

608
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,680
My bet's on.

609
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,400
Ah, they're both hard to pick.

610
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,520
All right.

611
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,100
I really, personally, I want- I want ba-bomb.

612
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,340
My first instinct was ba-bomb cause fire.

613
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,600
And fire good.

614
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,800
Look at him.

615
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,340
He's so angry.

616
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,640
And he looks just like dad.

617
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,380
Yes.

618
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,880
Mario the seed ba-bomb.

619
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,620
Would you like- Yes.

620
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,860
I'll name you dad.

621
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,400
All right.

622
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:54,860
Uh...

623
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,660
D...

624
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,360
Eh...

625
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:57,820
Oh, shit.

626
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,180
Dot, dot, dot.

627
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,100
D...

628
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,460
D...

629
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,020
D...

630
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,820
Uh...

631
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:08,940
Eh...

632
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,420
D...

633
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:10,840
Dad.

634
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:11,520
All right.

635
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,500
Nice.

636
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,320
All right.

637
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,660
Bring it down a little bit more.

638
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:14,940
All right.

639
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,400
No problem.

640
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,440
All right.

641
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,160
Let me know if it's better.

642
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,980
I think that's down.

643
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,280
Wait.

644
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,040
Actually, let me double check.

645
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,560
All right.

646
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,500
Yeah.

647
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:22,920
All right.

648
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,260
All right.

649
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,060
All right, Luigi.

650
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,060
Your turn.

651
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,420
I'll choose this.

652
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:30,980
Oh.

653
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,140
He's stupid.

654
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,900
Luigi.

655
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,480
That's why there's no more hero of Luigi.

656
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,260
That's why mom likes me more.

657
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,240
hier...

658
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:15,620
It's grass.

659
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,880
Oh, I like how we all have Cappy.

660
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,880
Send out Bitey.

661
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,740
Go, Dad!

662
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,080
Oh my god, he's about to explode.

663
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,960
Okay, let's work together.

664
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,340
Alright, but...

665
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,740
I'll take you down with me.

666
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,840
What?!

667
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,860
No way!

668
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,440
Are you serious?!

669
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,120
How do I fuck that up?!

670
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,300
He lives!

671
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,240
Why did he beat me?!

672
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,060
I took him down with me!

673
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,700
Luigi won by doing nothing at all!

674
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,020
I can't believe it!

675
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,500
He won by doing nothing at all!

676
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,400
That's so fucked up.

677
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:12,040
I can't believe I lost the happy year of Luigi.

678
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,480
You did amazing, Bitey!

679
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,180
And what a wonderful battle!

680
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,300
Okay, now I know.

681
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:20,480
No!

682
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,300
Now then, in order for someone to be a party party...

683
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,520
A pasta la pizza, Dokio!

684
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,780
Mask!

685
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,100
Thank you for the super chat!

686
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,320
Thank you, thank you!

687
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,440
Thank you!

688
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,600
They need to wear a specially designed cap I created!

689
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,320
The members you chose already have them!

690
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,540
But you're gonna need some more in the future!

691
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:42,400
Here!

692
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,860
They're in this care package!

693
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:44,980
Oh, yeah!

694
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,560
I received the care package!

695
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,080
No!

696
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,460
Thank you for the super chat!

697
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:48,780
Thank you!

698
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,260
Thank you!

699
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,900
He picked the weaker Pokemon so it will sing more when he won anyway!

700
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,060
Look!

701
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,620
He won by doing nothing!

702
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,680
I was the one that fucked up!

703
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,000
Inside it, obtain the caps!

704
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,340
Yay!

705
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,680
Alright, I got the Pokeballs.

706
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,780
These caps will also shrink down your creatures so that you may travel alongside you more easily!

707
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,560
It's just his aura!

708
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,640
Inside the package is also my patent-pending Tattle Dex!

709
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:24,280
When Link Girl Researcher and Scientist have compiled every capture strength as well as a quippy excerpt about them!

710
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,720
Alright, nice!

711
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,780
I got a Tattle Dex!

712
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,340
Now then, I suggest you two start heading to the castle as soon as you can!

713
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,780
This is not fair!

714
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,560
My self-destruct should have took him down with me!

715
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,380
We're the same level!

716
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,160
Well, bro!

717
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,440
I'm gonna head off to Toad Town!

718
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,500
Maybe I'll see you along the way!

719
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,580
What happened to being partners?!

720
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,320
What the fuck, Luigi?!

721
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,140
I thought we were partners, bro!

722
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,420
Oh, nice!

723
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,000
Oh, that's me like hitting the...

724
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,280
It's like the little mini Pokeballs!

725
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,440
Bro!

726
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,140
Oh, it doesn't do anything!

727
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,580
What happened to being partners?!

728
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,740
You're too weak!

729
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,700
Smell you later!

730
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,220
Oh, what's this?

731
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,140
Ant Ruper!

732
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,640
Oh, dad!

733
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,420
Alright!

734
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,560
Okay, we're not self-destructing this time!

735
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,360
We're...

736
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,820
We're just gonna do...

737
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,200
Why do I have non-fire moves?!

738
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,920
Why do I have an electric move?!

739
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,220
Alright, let's get Ant Ruper!

740
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:32,840
Alright!

741
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,780
Defense rises, let's capture you!

742
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,000
Where's my capture?

743
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,340
Plumber cap!

744
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:38,980
Let's go!

745
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,580
How does this look like?

746
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,530
I like how it rotates too!

747
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:47,250
Yay!

748
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,910
I get an Ant Trooper!

749
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,130
That gained 12 XP!

750
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:55,170
Yay!

751
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,090
What is the data?

752
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:01,130
An oversized insect is a tireless worker often used to transport goods.

753
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:06,070
Its shoes act like suction cups, and it can walk alongside walls and ceilings.

754
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,190
Alright!

755
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,350
Do you have a nickname to capture?

756
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:09,630
Yeah!

757
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:09,950
Alright!

758
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,050
What do I nickname you?

759
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,530
I shall nickname you...

760
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,150
You know what?

761
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,070
Let's just do dragoons!

762
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,530
This entire...

763
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,550
My team will just be filled with dragoons!

764
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,730
And the stronger you...

765
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,650
If you're strong enough, I'll put you in my...

766
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,970
Put you in my team!

767
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:23,610
Alright!

768
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:24,810
Uh, DJ!

769
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,010
Thank you for the super chat!

770
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:26,630
Thank you, thank you!

771
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,430
Congratulations!

772
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,670
You played yourself!

773
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:29,750
Alright, guys!

774
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,070
At first...

775
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,050
Who wants to be part?

776
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,530
Who wants to be Ant Trooper?

777
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,550
That...

778
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,370
You're gonna be put in the PC, by the way!

779
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:41,750
Alright!

780
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,370
Who wants to...

781
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:43,930
Me!

782
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:44,490
Alright!

783
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,650
Let me see who...

784
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,550
Not me!

785
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:46,910
Alex!

786
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,110
Because you don't wanna be in it, I'll put you in!

787
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:49,790
Alex!

788
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,670
It's okay!

789
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,450
I'm putting you...

790
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,310
I'm never gonna use you in a fight anyway!

791
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:57,330
Alex!

792
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,450
Don't worry!

793
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,830
You're gonna live in the PC!

794
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,350
I am...

795
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,590
I ain't having no bug!

796
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:02,890
I'm gonna get...

797
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:03,170
Don't worry!

798
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:03,770
Watch this!

799
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,310
I ain't having no bug in my party!

800
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,210
That poor soul!

801
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,330
Reverse psychology worked!

802
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,010
It's alright, Alex!

803
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,490
You're going in the PC!

804
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,550
I specifically went back just to deposit you!

805
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,570
Oh, I can't!

806
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,070
Not yet!

807
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:22,810
Goddammit!

808
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,290
I can only deposit items for now!

809
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,310
Alright, don't worry!

810
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,270
At the next...

811
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,250
At the next...

812
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,410
Pokemon Center, I'll put you in the PC!

813
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,550
I ain't having no bug type in my party!

814
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:36,710
I can't!

815
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:37,130
Oh, wait!

816
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,430
Nice!

817
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,310
I got another one!

818
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:39,350
What's this?

819
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,230
Oh my god!

820
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,070
It's a Koopa!

821
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:42,670
Wait, what?

822
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,830
Is this...

823
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,510
What type is the Koopa?

824
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,190
Oh!

825
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:47,810
Alright, let's see.

826
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:48,570
Let's use charge.

827
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,410
Tail whip?

828
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,390
Oh my god!

829
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,830
They have their own tails!

830
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,970
Alright, what does charge do?

831
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,550
Oh!

832
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,450
Oh, that's a stat thing!

833
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,150
Okay, I thought it was...

834
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,990
I don't...

835
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,590
I don't know a lot of mood types.

836
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,990
A critical hit!

837
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,870
Get out of here!

838
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,310
Is this a normal?

839
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,070
Oh, you're definitely going into my PC.

840
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,750
I ain't having no normal types in my...

841
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,410
I'm not having...

842
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:15,970
Ain't no...

843
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,810
Having no normies in my party.

844
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:18,870
I don't know.

845
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,050
I think I had like a stroke there.

846
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,150
So it's useless.

847
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:25,870
Exactly.

848
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,090
Alright.

849
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:29,450
Yay!

850
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,210
Koopa T was caught!

851
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:32,850
The Koopa Trooper!

852
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:33,770
Yay!

853
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,390
A turtle that is beyond loyal to the king.

854
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:43,090
The bottom of the shell is made of a low friction material that allows it to slide across the ground.

855
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:43,650
Alright.

856
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,470
What do we...

857
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,630
Alright, who wants to be the next Dragoon?

858
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,330
I feel like you could just be normal Dragoon.

859
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:53,270
No, we should name Dragoon for an actual Dragoon.

860
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,330
Like a dragon.

861
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,190
Alright.

862
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,010
Let's see.

863
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:00,450
Uh...

864
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:00,950
Oh my god.

865
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,210
Chad is moving so fast.

866
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:05,170
Chad is moving so fast, I don't know who to pick.

867
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,450
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

868
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,910
Uh, alright.

869
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,210
The...

870
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:13,810
Wait.

871
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,350
Where's the...

872
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,270
Oh shit.

873
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,450
Oops, I have to do this again.

874
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:19,850
Ha ha ha ha!

875
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:21,590
The...

876
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,350
Don't worry, you're also going into the...

877
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,630
You're going into the...

878
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,390
You're going into the PC.

879
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,730
You're a normal type.

880
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,190
You don't matter in my party.

881
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:31,330
Uh...

882
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,330
Where is it?

883
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:35,890
Oh my god.

884
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,970
I wish this was...

885
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,730
I wish I have a stylus right now.

886
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:39,890
And I could be like...

887
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:40,130
Wait.

888
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:40,830
Can I type it?

889
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,530
No.

890
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:41,950
Fuck!

891
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,690
This is the worst part.

892
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:46,910
Yeah.

893
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,190
Dragoon.

894
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:49,570
Alright.

895
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:50,410
Here we go.

896
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,310
Alright.

897
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:56,450
Alright.

898
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,730
Now we have to...

899
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:58,410
Hello, Louie.

900
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:58,890
Hey, bro.

901
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,310
You have your hammer on you?

902
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,340
If you do...

903
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,290
You can break...

904
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,030
Crack bricks like those.

905
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,130
Well then.

906
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,010
Now that I've done all my brotherly duty...

907
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,290
I'll be heading on to the toadown.

908
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,950
Oh, and don't forget to use your hammer?

909
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,730
Question mark box as well.

910
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:21,870
Alright.

911
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,130
Nice.

912
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,350
Oh, I can just press it.

913
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,030
I don't have to...

914
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,210
Actually bring it up.

915
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,810
I got a chef cap.

916
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,350
Is that like a better cap?

917
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,510
Oh, hey, toad!

918
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:31,170
Oh.

919
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,990
Oh, I got a goomba!

920
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,090
Is this also a normal type?

921
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,490
Pay to win.

922
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:41,930
Gross.

923
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,630
Can I be a dragon type?

924
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:44,910
Thank you for the super chat.

925
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:45,250
Thank you.

926
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:45,750
Thank you.

927
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,310
No, but you can be a goomba.

928
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,890
Because you want it to be a dragon type?

929
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,110
I'm giving you goomba duty.

930
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:58,750
That's right.

931
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,890
Now you're gonna be a goomba.

932
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,270
No!

933
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:08,510
That's right.

934
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:10,630
You're on the bottom of the food chain.

935
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,070
What if I just only level up, dad?

936
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:19,430
I'll make him like the strongest Mario Mon of all the land.

937
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,730
An angry, yet powerless mushroom.

938
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:24,750
That's you!

939
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,390
Its reputation as a weakling is earned.

940
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:33,070
It is said to be a traitor, abandoning unworry trainers during battle.

941
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:34,710
Yes.

942
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,690
All right.

943
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,870
You're gonna be my bench warmers.

944
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,030
All right.

945
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:40,570
Oh my God.

946
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,210
What if I do that?

947
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:41,810
Oh, wait.

948
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:42,330
I like...

949
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:42,470
Okay.

950
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,150
I like that.

951
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:44,730
Dragosis.

952
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,650
Like everybody will have...

953
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,890
We'll start with R.

954
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:48,710
All right.

955
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:49,830
I like that.

956
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:50,590
I like that idea.

957
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:52,610
Drag...

958
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,510
Osis.

959
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,090
It's like...

960
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,050
It's like Digimon where it ends in Mon.

961
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,690
But it starts...

962
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,350
It's...

963
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,850
It starts on...

964
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:07,090
It starts on Dra. Dra...

965
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:07,570
Oh wait.

966
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:07,970
Oh wait.

967
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:08,710
I spelt it wrong.

968
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:09,070
Whoops.

969
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:10,610
How do I...

970
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:12,910
Dra...

971
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:13,450
Osis.

972
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,150
Everyone just...

973
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,130
Or...

974
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,050
Krogoon.

975
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,070
Or maybe Goon.

976
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:19,770
Okay, guys.

977
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:20,750
Guys.

978
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:21,650
Do we do...

979
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:22,070
Do we...

980
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,250
Do we end on...

981
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,390
Oh, it can't end on Goon.

982
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:24,730
You're right.

983
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,030
I think they'll block me.

984
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,110
Dryosis.

985
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,130
I don't know.

986
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:32,830
Does it...

987
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:33,910
Or do we do Goon?

988
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:34,370
Guys.

989
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:35,250
We're experimenting.

990
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:39,510
One to one is rather small, don't you think?

991
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,310
But at least things are peaceful.

992
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:43,890
Hello.

993
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,330
Do we do Goon?

994
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:47,990
Alright.

995
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:49,190
Goon.

996
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:49,410
Okay.

997
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:50,350
We'll end on Goon.

998
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:52,810
Goon.

999
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,110
Alright.

1000
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:56,990
We'll just kill you.

1001
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:58,850
Koopa T.

1002
00:42:58,970 --> 00:42:59,770
I pity the boo.

1003
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:00,050
Wait.

1004
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,230
Thank you for the super chat.

1005
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:01,790
Thank you.

1006
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:02,330
Thank you.

1007
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,810
I'm playing the long game.

1008
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,810
Not asking to be a Pokemon now.

1009
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:06,870
So I can be a good one.

1010
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,670
She'll actually use later.

1011
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,930
I am very smart.

1012
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,050
Manny, thank you for the super chat.

1013
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:13,510
Thank you.

1014
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:14,210
Thank you.

1015
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:14,990
Alright.

1016
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,130
I will use Goon.

1017
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,350
We're experimenting.

1018
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,230
That's why the others are on their PC.

1019
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:22,570
That's why the others will be on the PC.

1020
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:25,770
Alright.

1021
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,030
I'm just gonna level up.

1022
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:27,330
Dad.

1023
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,150
Who cares about my other Pokemon?

1024
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:29,510
What?

1025
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:30,590
What?

1026
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,830
So are you saying I get stomped by Goki?

1027
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:38,970
Pretty sure some Diggoers are gonna say it should've been me.

1028
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,470
Thank you for the super chat.

1029
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,590
Thank you- Yeah, but you'll get stomped once before you're dead.

1030
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:44,530
Uhh.

1031
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:45,690
Let's see.

1032
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:46,910
Rae, thank you for the super chat.

1033
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:47,230
Thank you.

1034
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:47,570
Thank you.

1035
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:51,570
Thank you for the super chat.

1036
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:51,950
Thank you.

1037
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:52,550
Thank you.

1038
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:53,530
Alright.

1039
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:55,310
Found one mushroom.

1040
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:55,790
Oh, nice.

1041
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:58,850
That is all I need.

1042
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:02,810
Alright, oh wait, there's like a... Oh!

1043
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:05,190
Oh, I can't do anything there yet.

1044
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:05,570
Fuck.

1045
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,690
Oh, I'm like stuck in this one area.

1046
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,890
Don't worry, it's just level grinding.

1047
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:12,490
My one trick.

1048
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,630
Nothing can beat him!

1049
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,290
There's no way I'll fight a water type!

1050
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,470
Getting stopped by Dookie is once enough.

1051
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:25,530
I'll take it.

1052
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,170
Thank you for the super chat, Nexy.

1053
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:28,130
Thank you, thank you.

1054
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,130
Guys, I'm just shiny hunting, okay?

1055
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:31,830
Nice, critical hit.

1056
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:37,570
Look, I'm leveling him up now, so I don't have to level him up later.

1057
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:40,330
I'm just playing this long game here.

1058
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:42,410
Alright.

1059
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,650
I'm out here collecting flowers to sell, back at Tone Town's Market.

1060
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:48,890
Cool.

1061
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,190
That's it?

1062
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:50,590
Alright.

1063
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:51,610
How about you?

1064
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,790
This entrance is so relaxing.

1065
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:57,030
Thanks to you, of course, Mario.

1066
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,710
Nobody would ever cause trouble, given your home is right past one to one.

1067
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:03,210
Oh, it's the world!

1068
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,270
I was like, what the fuck, one one?

1069
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:09,050
And I forgot that's what Mario worlds are called.

1070
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:09,770
One one.

1071
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:11,550
Lord, thank you for the super chat.

1072
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,910
Thank you, they gunify me, Dookie.

1073
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:18,630
Since grosses hate birds, can I be a flying type?

1074
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:20,390
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

1075
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:21,250
Thank you, thank you.

1076
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:22,530
Alright, Tone Town.

1077
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:23,630
Okay, nice.

1078
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:26,690
Welcome to Tone Town, Mario!

1079
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:27,970
Looking for the professor?

1080
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:31,210
He went on ahead to Princess Peach Castle already.

1081
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:35,590
Just head east from here, and you should eventually reach the castle.

1082
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:37,330
Alright, nice.

1083
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:39,310
It can't be that difficult.

1084
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:40,090
Wait, who are you?

1085
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:42,010
How do I talk to you?

1086
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,530
Shaman has wares for the right people.

1087
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:45,330
Hmm.

1088
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,550
You're not someone who can handle my wares.

1089
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,710
Come back when you have one- I need to get a power star!

1090
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,990
I need to go fucking play Mario Party!

1091
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,310
Are you listening to me, dear?

1092
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,330
We still have a long ways to go today!

1093
00:45:58,070 --> 00:45:58,510
Oh!

1094
00:45:58,790 --> 00:45:59,270
Mario!

1095
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:02,990
Talk some sense into this girl, will you?

1096
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,070
She has no respect for her elders!

1097
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:08,850
I can't open up a shop until she helps me gather ingredients!

1098
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:11,170
Mario!

1099
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:12,610
Please help me!

1100
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:15,630
I want to try the captain challenge as well!

1101
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:18,370
But my grandfather won't let me!

1102
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:20,650
Fuck yeah!

1103
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:23,030
I don't know how people can do this voice all the time.

1104
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:23,850
Alright.

1105
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:24,870
Oh, wait!

1106
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:26,250
Wait, those are regular berries!

1107
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,810
Wait, those are regular Pokemon berries!

1108
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:29,170
What?

1109
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:32,110
I thought everything was Mario themed!

1110
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:33,730
Alright, let's see.

1111
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:34,830
Is there anything in here?

1112
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:39,110
Why is there regular Pokemon berries in my Mario-mon game?

1113
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,550
Oh, there's the...

1114
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:41,730
There's the Pokemon Center!

1115
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:43,310
Hello!

1116
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,030
You're still- Yep.

1117
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:46,710
Please...

1118
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,310
Please recover...

1119
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:51,190
Please recover my one Pokemon.

1120
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:52,610
Alright.

1121
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:56,210
Into the PC, you go!

1122
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:58,970
Alright.

1123
00:46:59,110 --> 00:46:59,570
Oh, wait, no.

1124
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:00,610
That's not what I wanted.

1125
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:02,370
Wait, can I do this?

1126
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:02,710
Oh.

1127
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,330
I didn't do the deposit.

1128
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:06,390
Alright.

1129
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:07,250
Move capture.

1130
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,810
Into the PC, you go!

1131
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:12,850
Goodbye!

1132
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,290
Goodbye!

1133
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:19,890
Goodbye!

1134
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:20,330
Goodbye!

1135
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,070
This is your home now!

1136
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,140
You live on my computer!

1137
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:26,220
You live on my computer!

1138
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1139
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,460
I have named access to rare cannons regardless.

1140
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,180
To do so, you need consent to enabling the content creator mode.

1141
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:41,000
With this option enabled, you'll be able to receive as many rare cannons and coins as you like.

1142
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,340
However, you'll be unable to turn this- Oh my god!

1143
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,280
It will be on my permanent record!

1144
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:54,140
Would you like to- The content creator mode is like- Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

1145
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,700
It should have been called journalist mode.

1146
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,120
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

1147
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,060
Alright.

1148
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,620
Oh, I should- Wait, I can rename the box.

1149
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,060
You're right.

1150
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,180
You are a content creator.

1151
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,600
Do I just give- Do I just go easy mode, right?

1152
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,000
You're right.

1153
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,040
I should rename the box.

1154
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:11,400
Uh, wallpaper.

1155
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,320
What are the different- Snow, cave...

1156
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,740
Oh, you guys should be in the cave.

1157
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,860
There we go.

1158
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:19,780
Name.

1159
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,260
I'll rename the box.

1160
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,740
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1161
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,380
What do you name it?

1162
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,700
Um...

1163
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:29,580
Exiled.

1164
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,520
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1165
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,580
Exciled.

1166
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,600
There we go.

1167
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,140
Prison!

1168
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:46,760
There you go.

1169
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:47,720
Please go.

1170
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,380
There you go.

1171
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,820
They're exiled to the Goon Cave.

1172
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,720
We all know what cave it is.

1173
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,560
We all know what cave it is.

1174
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,420
We don't have to taxi it.

1175
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:58,460
No worries.

1176
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:00,920
Alright.

1177
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:01,840
See ya.

1178
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,560
Oh, hey.

1179
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:11,120
There are 150 different captures to record in your Taldex, but I've also heard rumors of a crazy powerful capture that's number one.

1180
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,060
151.

1181
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,320
Hey Mario!

1182
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,840
Keep yourself safe!

1183
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,380
It's dangerous out there.

1184
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,500
Wait, you just said keep yourself safe.

1185
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:32,670
I'm sorry, but the second floor is currently on the... Oh, wait a minute.

1186
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,830
Whoa, Toad!

1187
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,910
It's like the Toad in the Epic Universe.

1188
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:45,250
Where, um, where...

1189
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:50,150
If you, if you, like, scan your Mario watch, it shows the Toad flipping you off.

1190
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:51,670
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1191
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:52,570
I'm friendly.

1192
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:56,350
Not all Koopas and Goombas are playing the game.

1193
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:59,070
So don't hesitate to talk to us.

1194
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,490
Not all Koopas, guys.

1195
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:05,590
Hey, Mario!

1196
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:07,890
I hear you're taking part in the cap challenge.

1197
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:10,770
If you ever come across a Yoshi, would you mind showing me?

1198
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:14,130
And if you do, I'll even give you a reward.

1199
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:15,090
Alright.

1200
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:15,550
Nice.

1201
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,810
The quest Yoshi lover is now active.

1202
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:18,470
Whoa.

1203
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,810
How much of a lover are you?

1204
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:23,230
I wonder how many worlds out there.

1205
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:24,290
Eight worlds?

1206
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:25,150
Wow.

1207
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:26,470
Eight worlds.

1208
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,810
Hashtag not all Koopas.

1209
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:30,590
Where does this go?

1210
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:32,390
What is this?

1211
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:34,150
Welcome to the Warpstone.

1212
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:36,190
Unfortunately, we're going on the growing maintenance.

1213
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:39,290
Please exit the town and use the east exit.

1214
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,610
Do I go to World 3 or World 4 first?

1215
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:44,790
I can't decide.

1216
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,510
The Warpstone was a genius idea planned by Professor E.

1217
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:50,970
Gag.

1218
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:52,630
With the help from Princess Peach.

1219
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,550
It makes it much easier for everyone to get to all worlds.

1220
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:56,910
Alright.

1221
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,790
One toad's going to be like fucking...

1222
00:50:58,790 --> 00:50:59,250
What was it?

1223
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:00,290
Keegan?

1224
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:01,710
Uh, Michael.

1225
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:02,370
Oh my god.

1226
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:02,690
What was it?

1227
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:04,190
Keegan Peel?

1228
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,030
One is going to be Peel.

1229
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:08,450
So I don't have to do this voice all the time.

1230
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:12,350
Alright.

1231
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:13,330
Sorry.

1232
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,510
The battle school is closed at the moment.

1233
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:17,270
Come back when things are ready.

1234
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:18,130
Bro.

1235
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,910
Everything is closed in Toad Town.

1236
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:22,150
Is anything open?

1237
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:24,410
Hey there, Mario.

1238
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:25,990
Heading out to 1 too?

1239
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:28,830
There's something you might want to know if you're heading out there.

1240
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:30,670
Do you know about Quest?

1241
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:35,130
You should always be keeping an eye for troubled citizens of the Mushroom Kingdom.

1242
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:38,690
Make sure to help anyone out if you see them.

1243
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:39,450
Can I go out?

1244
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:40,410
Oh, I can.

1245
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:40,870
Okay.

1246
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,130
No non-toads allowed in my Toad Town.

1247
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:48,430
I've been hearing rumors that Bowser Jr. is now king of the Mountain Kingdom.

1248
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:49,930
That can't be true.

1249
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,230
I wonder how Bowser is here about that.

1250
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:56,830
I don't know how Mint can sing in this voice.

1251
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,360
Wait, is this a gym?

1252
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,240
No.

1253
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,300
That's just a trap there.

1254
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,500
The storehouse is such a mess.

1255
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,600
Am I having?

1256
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:07,600
I'm in here.

1257
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,920
He's going to clean us up this mess.

1258
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:09,140
Alright.

1259
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:09,580
Don't worry.

1260
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,180
I got you.

1261
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,580
I did it.

1262
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:15,580
Nice.

1263
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:16,900
Don't worry.

1264
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,380
Legally stealing your stuff.

1265
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,520
I'm just helping you.

1266
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:22,600
Alright.

1267
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:22,980
Nice.

1268
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:26,540
Yeah.

1269
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,820
Wait, I got a TM.

1270
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,020
I never use...

1271
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,200
I never use the TMs at all.

1272
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,600
I don't care as much.

1273
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,220
I just use the moves they give me.

1274
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,220
Alright.

1275
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,500
What's up here?

1276
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,040
Hello, Toad.

1277
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,500
Do you have anything in your trash I can steal?

1278
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:47,680
My best friend left for a trip to the Cloud Kingdom.

1279
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,080
I haven't heard it for me since.

1280
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,400
I hope she's doing alright.

1281
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:54,600
Alright.

1282
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,080
That was...

1283
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,120
A waste of my time.

1284
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,120
Different captures have different types.

1285
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,820
I want to find all the bug type ones.

1286
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:01,620
Oh my god.

1287
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:02,360
Are you...

1288
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:03,900
Don't be a loser.

1289
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,220
Bug types are the worst.

1290
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,720
We're in a very intense chess match.

1291
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,360
So if you can...

1292
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,400
Please excuse us.

1293
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:10,840
Where's the chess?

1294
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,000
It seems to be eating a piece of...

1295
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,380
Okay, look.

1296
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,280
He's talking in his mind.

1297
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,620
So, like, in his mind, he does not sound like Toad.

1298
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,720
Back in my day, we didn't have capture centers.

1299
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,920
We have good old-fashioned one-ups.

1300
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,040
And if you didn't have extra one on you, then it's game over.

1301
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,900
I'm back to the start.

1302
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,520
Huh?

1303
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,820
I can't hear you.

1304
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,280
Oh, he's old.

1305
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,500
Oh my god, he's old!

1306
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,300
Look at him!

1307
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,320
Oh my god!

1308
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,040
Look at him!

1309
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,020
He's so old!

1310
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,140
Oh my god, he's...

1311
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:49,720
Okay, I...

1312
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,600
Alright, guys, let me see.

1313
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,100
Oh my god, he's so old.

1314
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,040
I think he's at least 30.

1315
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,700
Okay, I...

1316
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,520
JK, JK, I didn't mean that, guys.

1317
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,340
I didn't...

1318
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,060
I didn't...

1319
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,340
I didn't mean that.

1320
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,640
Bro is...

1321
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,120
I didn't mean that, guys.

1322
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:11,760
I'm joking.

1323
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,600
I'm joking.

1324
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:15,860
Oh, wait.

1325
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,500
Oh, that's a fan club for me!

1326
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,000
Alright, if their fucking conversation is not relevant, I'm not gonna read it.

1327
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,180
Okay.

1328
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,980
I love Super Mario Bros.

1329
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:27,160
3!

1330
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,000
Okay, that was incredibly relevant.

1331
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:29,820
I...

1332
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,280
Are they all just being like, I love Super Mario Bros.

1333
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:32,620
3?

1334
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:33,540
Is that it?

1335
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,140
Oh my god, that's really it.

1336
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,200
That's the Super Mario Bros.

1337
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:38,600
3.

1338
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:39,460
It's...

1339
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,120
It's all just a marathon Super Mario Bros.

1340
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,300
3 speedrun thing.

1341
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,060
Oh my god.

1342
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,800
When they said fan club of Super Mario Bros.

1343
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,220
3, it was actually a fan club.

1344
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,880
Excuse me, Mario, right?

1345
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,540
Am I doing you a favor?

1346
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,060
My grandson went out to 1, 2 a few hours back.

1347
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,380
And hasn't come back.

1348
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,980
I'm just fraught with...

1349
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:05,140
Wait, won't you please go search for him?

1350
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,820
Kuma, think about the Super Chat.

1351
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:08,120
Thank you.

1352
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:08,620
Thank you.

1353
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,040
I love Super Mario Bros.

1354
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,300
3!

1355
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,560
Dr. Yuriko, thank you for the Super Chat.

1356
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,040
Thank you, thank you.

1357
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,120
Oh yeah, he's definitely dead.

1358
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,380
The brother of mine always going out exploring.

1359
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,820
Niggly is just reckless, not stupid.

1360
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,240
He should be alright.

1361
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:33,880
They keep taking her Marvel Rivals Rage out on the track.

1362
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,460
Oh, you want me to out?

1363
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,240
No, no, no.

1364
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,620
I'll show you what actual rage is like.

1365
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,900
Alright, let me...

1366
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:46,300
Alright.

1367
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,600
Alright, I will draw...

1368
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,300
No, actually...

1369
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,340
No, I'll get the Goomba out.

1370
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,040
Give me a sec.

1371
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,660
You can stay in the box.

1372
00:55:59,200 --> 00:55:59,460
Alright.

1373
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,100
You want to know what real rage is like?

1374
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:03,840
Let me...

1375
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,100
Alright, let's see.

1376
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,940
Oh, you're level 2.

1377
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:07,820
That's perfect.

1378
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,280
Alright, let's go out in the grass.

1379
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:18,780
Don't worry.

1380
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,060
We'll progress soon, guys.

1381
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,320
We'll progress soon.

1382
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:26,760
Oh, man.

1383
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:27,580
Oh, shit.

1384
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:28,840
Another Goomba.

1385
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:29,560
Oh, man.

1386
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,100
What's going to happen to Dryosis?

1387
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,820
Let's try and run.

1388
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,560
Oh, you can't escape.

1389
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,120
Oh, that's so unfortunate.

1390
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:39,360
Oh, no.

1391
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:40,660
Oh, you got the first hit.

1392
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,280
Don't worry.

1393
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,840
I'll let sure you get a tackle in.

1394
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:44,680
Let's...

1395
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,580
Oh, my God.

1396
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,800
That's your damage?

1397
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,220
That's your...

1398
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:51,660
Alright.

1399
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,160
Oh, look at you go.

1400
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,060
Wow.

1401
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,560
Look at you go.

1402
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,940
Fight back, buddy.

1403
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,920
The slow and painful death.

1404
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,980
He's so weak.

1405
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,560
Do anything.

1406
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,620
He is trying his best.

1407
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,040
Which is the sad part.

1408
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:17,360
Alright.

1409
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:18,220
Next up.

1410
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,440
It's your turn.

1411
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,460
Get up.

1412
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:23,720
Grandpa.

1413
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,000
It's your turn.

1414
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,800
Oh, man.

1415
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,480
Don't worry.

1416
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:31,640
His defense fell.

1417
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,260
You're going to be so...

1418
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:36,620
You're going to have such a strong attack when it's your turn.

1419
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,320
Oh, man.

1420
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:42,900
Don't worry.

1421
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:44,320
I'll make you attack soon.

1422
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,540
Don't worry.

1423
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,420
Don't worry, you're gonna have your turn.

1424
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,100
Oh, she's killing that.

1425
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:55,160
Nevermind, keep me out of your game, you sadist.

1426
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:59,100
Johnny, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1427
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,680
Alright dad, go sweep this up for me.

1428
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:04,760
Go do your thing.

1429
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,320
Alright, nice.

1430
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,800
How is he faster?

1431
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,720
He's level 3!

1432
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,020
Aw man, thanks for weakening him for me.

1433
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,840
Dryosis and D-Dragon.

1434
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,540
I appreciate it.

1435
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,720
Alright, nice, we did it.

1436
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:19,720
See, alright.

1437
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,940
Now, did you guys learn your lesson?

1438
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,540
You must.

1439
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,020
Did you learn your lesson, guys?

1440
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:33,440
Alright.

1441
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,760
Maybe support players deserve to be oppressed.

1442
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:41,840
D-Dragon, thank you for the super chat.

1443
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,660
Oh my god, I don't even heal you.

1444
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,380
You just go straight back into the box.

1445
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,500
Alright, nice.

1446
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,960
Not one bit.

1447
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,980
Now the ant will know.

1448
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,680
The ant will know not to fuck with me.

1449
00:58:55,820 --> 00:59:00,260
Man, I wish I was getting publicly humiliated like that by Toki.

1450
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,060
Hey guys, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1451
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:03,840
Alright.

1452
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:06,920
Aye!

1453
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,760
The salty breeze never fails to tug at me heartstrings!

1454
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:14,120
Fancy a story from an old- Oh my god, guys, I cannot.

1455
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:14,720
Alright.

1456
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,700
In his mind, in his storytelling head, it's like a normal voice.

1457
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,700
Many moons ago, me ship, the seabird, was caught in the fiercest storm I've seen.

1458
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,480
The waves were mountains and the wind screamed.

1459
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:30,960
It's like when Donald Duck ate this pill that made him sound, like, really hot.

1460
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:35,980
We fought tooth and nail to keep the vessels afloat as the sea toyed with us.

1461
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:41,160
Just when it seemed like the sea was to take us, we fought it beaking a light through the rain.

1462
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,540
It was a lighthouse, and it saved our hides that night.

1463
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:50,920
We moved to it like mobs to the flame, until we saw the lighthouse keeper frantically waving us away.

1464
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:57,480
He knew the dangers of his rocky shore, and he was trying to save us from being scurried.

1465
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,700
Yeah, there was no way I was reading this in the toad voice.

1466
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:03,820
We managed to steer clear of the jagged rocks and found shelter in a cove.

1467
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:06,500
We spent the night there, waiting out the storm.

1468
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:12,740
The next morning, when the skies cleared, we want to thank the lighthouse keeper who had disappeared with all the traces...

1469
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:14,500
Oh my god, he was a g-g-ghost!

1470
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:23,440
We couldn't even find a lighthouse that guided us the night before.

1471
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,080
Ah, you've been a fine audience.

1472
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:31,060
It warms my heart to know there are still folks like ye who appreciate the old stories.

1473
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,000
Here, take this.

1474
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:34,500
Yay!

1475
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,460
I got a rare candy!

1476
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,460
Dusty, thank you for the super chat.

1477
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,300
Thank you, thank you.

1478
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:43,040
I'm one of the playtesters for this, and I hope you enjoyed the game as much as I did.

1479
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,300
It's so cool seeing you play this wrong, my friends.

1480
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,360
Thank you for the super chat.

1481
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:47,040
Thank you, thank you.

1482
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,320
Yeah, it's been fun so far.

1483
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:54,840
It's been fun sending, um, um, sending people, sending my dragoons out to fight.

1484
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:59,760
Come back, and once you've grown some hair on chests, and I'll tell another tale.

1485
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:00,860
But I'm Italian!

1486
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,600
I already have hair on my chest!

1487
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,620
Ah, the ocean is so nice this time of year!

1488
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:11,580
I wonder my head will let me float in the water!

1489
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,000
Wait, I got rare candy!

1490
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:15,480
You know what that means.

1491
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,040
Uh...

1492
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,260
Wait, what's the baseball cap?

1493
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:20,960
Oh, it has a...

1494
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,360
Oh, that's the great ball!

1495
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,600
Okay, uh...

1496
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,480
Alright, I'll give it to the one...

1497
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,700
Wait, actually, what level...

1498
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,820
I think I'm about to level up Dad, so let me double check real quick.

1499
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,420
Where is it?

1500
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,620
Oh yeah, he's about to level up.

1501
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:36,640
I shouldn't give it to him.

1502
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,160
I'll give it to him when he levels up.

1503
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,080
See, he's strats, guys.

1504
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:42,820
What's this?

1505
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:44,340
Mario!

1506
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,700
I wish I could be part of the cap challenge!

1507
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,660
I'll stay here and watch the screen!

1508
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:49,060
Why?

1509
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,480
Because I was told to!

1510
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:52,120
Good Toad's follow orders!

1511
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,120
I'm a handyman!

1512
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,240
That means I'm a...

1513
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,720
Oh my god, I should not have read that.

1514
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,220
That's a waste of a toad voice.

1515
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,240
We see a lot of ships come in!

1516
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:04,360
But nothing like the Odyssey you brought in earlier!

1517
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,500
She should be repaired some months from now!

1518
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:07,380
So check in then!

1519
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,880
My brain is a hundred percent toad!

1520
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,040
Alright, now I have to pick and choose who gets the toad voice.

1521
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,220
This is too many.

1522
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,080
I can't believe there are so many toads in Toad Town!

1523
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,560
Okay, yeah.

1524
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,300
Oh, I have to get eight power stars.

1525
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,580
Okay, guys.

1526
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,660
Sorry, this was not important enough to be read.

1527
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:29,480
out loud.

1528
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:30,960
And then...

1529
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:31,860
Sorry, guys.

1530
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,160
That was not important enough.

1531
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:36,200
Too many toads, one might say.

1532
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,700
Alright, guys.

1533
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,880
I'm picking and choosing.

1534
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,080
This is not relevant information, guys.

1535
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:46,880
Oh!

1536
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,720
I heard that buying ten plumbing caps at once gets you a free cap!

1537
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,400
I'm gonna try and capture only those caps!

1538
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:55,860
Every toad line...

1539
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,080
Toki, you don't understand.

1540
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:01,500
Each toad line is very integral to the part of Super Mario mod.

1541
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,200
If you miss one line, it's over.

1542
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,200
This run is dead.

1543
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:09,920
Alright, off I go.

1544
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,640
Oh, World 1-2.

1545
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:15,360
Mario!

1546
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,620
You made it to World 1-2, huh?

1547
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:20,960
From here on out, there will be other toads.

1548
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:23,860
Get you to try out this new game the princess came up with.

1549
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,780
Make sure I give you all you got!

1550
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,040
Yeah!

1551
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:28,560
Okay, is he gonna fight me?

1552
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,200
Fight me, toad!

1553
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,620
Hey, Mario!

1554
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:36,580
Ken!

1555
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:37,940
Ken the toad!

1556
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,040
Let's battle!

1557
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:39,120
Oh!

1558
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,360
They have names?

1559
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,800
I thought they're all just toads!

1560
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,320
Oh my god, it's Youngster Toad.

1561
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,780
Oh my god, he brought a Goomba to a toad fight?

1562
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,320
Alright, goodbye Goomba.

1563
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,600
Destroy Ken, my boy Ken!

1564
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,680
Get out of here Ken!

1565
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,760
You brought a Goomba to a toad fight?

1566
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:03,440
You should've fought- You should've just fucking fought yourself, toad.

1567
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:05,360
Why can't I catch the toad?

1568
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:07,860
Whoa!

1569
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:09,240
So that's a cat battle!

1570
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,300
Anywhere else he'd be a dead.

1571
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,380
Oh, do I get new- new mons?

1572
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:17,940
No, it's still a Koopa.

1573
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,340
Be shy, welcome to tomato farm!

1574
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,180
Welcome, welcome!

1575
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:25,760
Oh, and you're saying Koopas are not- Don't deserve rice either?

1576
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,860
What about the poor Koopas?

1577
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:31,180
They also live in a village too!

1578
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:35,260
They are part- They're citizens in Koopa Village!

1579
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:39,780
What a- They don't count.

1580
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:48,820
Not- Not in Toad Town.

1581
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:52,660
Okay, wait, let me uh- Let me use my rare candy now.

1582
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,180
Alright, nice.

1583
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,880
Only- Only Yoshi lives matter.

1584
01:04:59,060 --> 01:04:59,200
Wait.

1585
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,140
No, I don't like- Yeah, stop trying to- Yeah, Screech is not a good move.

1586
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,480
I don't like using the stat moves.

1587
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:07,580
I'm not one- I'm- I'm those people.

1588
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:13,480
I'm like the ones that just use all attacks.

1589
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,940
I'd never use stat moves.

1590
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,200
Not all Koopas.

1591
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,580
Like- Alright!

1592
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:24,320
If I- If- A Koopa is literally in the Pokemon Center right now trying to talk to me.

1593
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:25,980
Hehehehe.

1594
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:31,000
So like- Why can I catch him when I can't catch a toad?

1595
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,340
They're like the same size.

1596
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:43,080
Alright, let's go- Yeah, the only stat change that matters is... exactly.

1597
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,260
It's reducing their HP to zero.

1598
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,220
You get it.

1599
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:48,880
Hey, Mario!

1600
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,220
Have you seen any of the warp pipes yet?

1601
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,140
All you gotta do is go up to them and jump on in!

1602
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:55,340
Oh, cool.

1603
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:55,940
I'll try it.

1604
01:05:59,200 --> 01:05:59,640
Yay!

1605
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,000
Wait, where am I?

1606
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,480
Mario, what are you... I lost it.

1607
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:06,280
What are you doing here?

1608
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,080
What?

1609
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,480
My grandpa still gets lost out here?

1610
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,880
That's ridiculous.

1611
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,960
How did anyone get lost in such a small space?

1612
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,480
Oh, I get it.

1613
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,780
They're probably wondering where I wandered off to.

1614
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:18,220
Again.

1615
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:18,980
Here!

1616
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,400
If I hear your body...

1617
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,440
Oh my god, I could've been healed here!

1618
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:24,840
Wasting my time.

1619
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:26,160
Oh, nice.

1620
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,740
Do I have to go back to the grandpa and be like, he's not lost?

1621
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:33,680
Oh my god!

1622
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,040
Oh, it's that song!

1623
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:52,400
Oh my god, it's so cute!

1624
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:53,580
They used the...

1625
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,040
The under... The cave song!

1626
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,100
Yeah, the underground scene.

1627
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:57,960
Where am I?

1628
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:59,000
Where am I?

1629
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:02,120
I can't do anything here, though.

1630
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,600
Oh, I can jump down from here.

1631
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,480
Oh!

1632
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:06,200
Alright, fight me.

1633
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:07,920
I think you're prepared?

1634
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:10,340
What's his name?

1635
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:13,920
Youngster Shigeru would like to battle.

1636
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:15,860
What the fuck?

1637
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,620
Oh my god, it's an electric thing!

1638
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,740
It's those, like, electricity things!

1639
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
On the, like...

1640
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,040
Oh my god, my...

1641
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,120
Dad is so slow.

1642
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,760
I mean, it makes sense because he's like...

1643
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,000
Uh...

1644
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,160
He, like, walks up.

1645
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:34,370
Alright, Monty...

1646
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:35,670
Oh, it's Monty Mole!

1647
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:38,490
Wait, I want a Monty Mole in my party!

1648
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:40,390
Wait, that's so cute!

1649
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:43,550
Oh, it's super effective.

1650
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:45,970
Alright.

1651
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:47,630
Monty, my boy!

1652
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:50,730
I wish I could, like, steal their Pokemon.

1653
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:52,170
Like, uh...

1654
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:53,730
The Pokemon Dark series.

1655
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:55,370
The Shadow Luigi...

1656
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:56,170
Luigi one.

1657
01:07:57,170 --> 01:07:57,850
Luigi...

1658
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:58,470
Luigi...

1659
01:07:58,470 --> 01:07:58,690
Luigi...

1660
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:02,330
Shadow Luigi...

1661
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:02,630
Um...

1662
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:03,210
Lugia...

1663
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:03,470
Sorry!

1664
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:05,190
Shadow Lugia...

1665
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:07,570
Shadow Luigi...

1666
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:11,570
Lots of toads!

1667
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:13,030
Love going for walks out here!

1668
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:16,350
Although things have been a bit more exciting thanks to the cab!

1669
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:19,170
I don't know where I can find...

1670
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:20,330
Maybe...

1671
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:20,810
Whew!

1672
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:24,470
Now I just gotta go through one of these castles in order to make it to Peach Castle!

1673
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:27,230
I gotta enter a castle in order to get to another one?

1674
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:29,450
Something's kind of odd, if you ask me!

1675
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,870
I'm growing my team!

1676
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:34,890
Check them out!

1677
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:41,820
Yeah, a stinking leg...

1678
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:42,020
Oh!

1679
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:42,360
Shit!

1680
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:43,620
No!

1681
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:45,200
Oh, fuck.

1682
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:45,600
Okay.

1683
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:46,340
Oh, no.

1684
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:47,420
Oh, no.

1685
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:49,180
I spilled my iced tea!

1686
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:50,140
Oh, no!

1687
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:51,180
Oh!

1688
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,200
SOS!

1689
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:53,620
No!

1690
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,320
Oh!

1691
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:56,460
I did it again!

1692
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,880
Okay, give me a sec, guys.

1693
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:00,680
I gotta clean.

1694
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,520
I gotta clean.

1695
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:03,480
Oh, no.

1696
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:04,760
Oh, no.

1697
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:05,480
Oh, no.

1698
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:06,260
Oh, this is bad.

1699
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,280
Oh!

1700
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:10,120
I had an open brisk iced tea.

1701
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,420
Not again!

1702
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,000
It's okay.

1703
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,520
It's not okay.

1704
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,720
But it's okay.

1705
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,120
Oh, no.

1706
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:19,320
Be a sec.

1707
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:20,340
Let me clean this.

1708
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:21,580
Oh, no.

1709
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,040
I-I just put it...

1710
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,000
I just capped it up.

1711
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,060
Oh!

1712
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,440
Not again!

1713
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:28,000
Not again!

1714
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,060
I'll be right back!

1715
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,540
Luigi failed me!

1716
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,000
I played Luigi.

1717
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,060
This is Luigi's fault.

1718
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,060
The sound.

1719
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:45,240
The sound.

1720
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,320
The sound.

1721
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,100
Oh my god.

1722
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:48,320
No!

1723
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:50,660
No!

1724
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,660
I got it on the floor!

1725
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:54,520
The sound.

1726
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,100
Oh, no.

1727
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:57,540
No!

1728
01:09:58,680 --> 01:09:59,360
No!

1729
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,280
Oh, it's always Luigi's fault!

1730
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,520
Okay, I gotta clean up the floor real quick.

1731
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:08,760
Oh, it's so hard.

1732
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:12,540
I just got my apartment clean.

1733
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:24,750
Oh.

1734
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:25,310
Oh.

1735
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:29,450
Oh, I was coming!

1736
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:31,470
Sorry, I spilled risk eyes to you.

1737
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:34,410
Oh, I'm like, I'm getting it up.

1738
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:35,410
Right now.

1739
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:39,330
Oh, I'm just sick.

1740
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:43,910
I have... Okay, the worst part is that I had my, like, fighting game controller.

1741
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:47,830
The Razor one on the floor.

1742
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:56,130
It was... It may or may not have been on the floor and got stashed by the water.

1743
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:01,190
Oh, no.

1744
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:02,930
Guys, it's okay.

1745
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:07,390
It means I might not be playing any time soon.

1746
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:10,990
I blame Luigi.

1747
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:12,250
This is Luigi's fault.

1748
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:17,350
This is why your gear failed and made zero profit for Nintendo.

1749
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:20,310
And the... That's fucking where I said it.

1750
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:24,110
Okay, I'm drying this out real quick.

1751
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:27,990
Oh, my floor is gonna be sticky now!

1752
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:29,670
No!

1753
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:32,670
Not the sticky floors!

1754
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:34,930
That's the worst part.

1755
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:35,690
That's the worst part.

1756
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:37,450
When your floors become sticky.

1757
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:39,930
Why couldn't it just be water?

1758
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:43,990
My water bottle was next to the fucking brisk ice tea!

1759
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:51,590
Sticky!

1760
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:55,680
Sticky!

1761
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,340
Oh!

1762
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,420
I hate it when it's sticky!

1763
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:00,980
Oh!

1764
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:01,060
Oh!

1765
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:07,900
I have cleaning products, but, like, I don't think I have time.

1766
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,780
I'll clean this later.

1767
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:10,880
I'll use cleaning products for it later.

1768
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:12,340
Oh, fuck.

1769
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,780
No, my drinks was next...

1770
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:17,960
It was on my right-hand side, uncapped.

1771
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,780
My brisk ice tea.

1772
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,680
And I accidentally smacked it.

1773
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:27,560
You know, the worst part is that I also spilled, like, orange juice on my keyboard yesterday.

1774
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:28,880
Like, just...

1775
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,000
I'm just extra clumsy.

1776
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:30,460
I...

1777
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:30,860
I...

1778
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:31,100
Like...

1779
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,100
And, like, that's...

1780
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:33,660
This never happens to me!

1781
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:38,080
The last two days, I'm just spilling drinks left and right!

1782
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:39,640
You know what?

1783
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,780
This is why I should have kept drinking water.

1784
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:43,820
Usually, I'm, like, water only.

1785
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:47,220
But, like, the last couple of days, I was feeling a little quirky.

1786
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:48,680
I was like, you know what?

1787
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,240
I'm gonna drink something else that's not whining!

1788
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:52,560
I'm gonna drink orange juice!

1789
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:53,880
I'm gonna do it!

1790
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:55,140
I'm gonna drink orange juice!

1791
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:57,800
And then, of course, I spill orange juice.

1792
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:58,640
I...

1793
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:04,460
Alright.

1794
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:05,740
Let's use ember.

1795
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,080
It's a bug-type anyway.

1796
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:09,820
Nice.

1797
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,300
Goodbye, Ant Trooper.

1798
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:12,580
Goodbye.

1799
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,300
Only 7 XP?!

1800
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:18,260
Oh my god, what the fuck is that?!

1801
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,280
A Biddybud?

1802
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,620
Okay, clearly, I, like, I'm out of the Mario lore.

1803
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:26,160
There are some things that I don't know.

1804
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,880
The fuck is a Biddybud?

1805
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,680
What game does that come from?

1806
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,020
How big do you want your team?!

1807
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:33,360
It's just gonna be one Pokemon.

1808
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:35,600
Unless...

1809
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,900
Unless they're worthy!

1810
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:39,700
I'm a one-mon type of gal.

1811
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:42,700
Oh, I never played 3D World.

1812
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,780
I don't think I have played it.

1813
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:46,860
Yeah, Battles!

1814
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,400
Sure are attempts, aren't they, Mario?

1815
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:51,960
Um...

1816
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,320
Hey, KB, thank you for the Super Chat!

1817
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:54,300
Thank you, thank you!

1818
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:55,860
It was me, Doki.

1819
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:02,580
I was the one who slightly moved your brisk ice tea over to make it seem like you were the one who split and make your floor sticky.

1820
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,380
Thank you for the Super Chat!

1821
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,380
Thank you, thank you!

1822
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:06,560
Warkybird!

1823
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,060
Hey, Dorkyo!

1824
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:11,540
Send us- send us some of that super gold my way!

1825
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:15,480
Hey, thank you in the super chat, worky bird.

1826
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:19,020
Oh no, it's worky.

1827
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:21,440
Alright.

1828
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:23,120
Oh, it's a guy over there.

1829
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,300
I was like, why won't it let me through?

1830
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:26,800
Wait, did I come from here?

1831
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,860
Yeah, this was my warp portal.

1832
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:33,980
Okay, let me... I'm gonna have to talk to the grandpa and be like, I found your son.

1833
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:37,660
Alright, go dad, go.

1834
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:43,880
Okay, let me just kill everything here, so I don't have to grind later.

1835
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:52,460
I just, uh, that's like my biggest peeve about, like, Pokemon games, is that, like, you have, like, the grinding part.

1836
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:57,120
If you don't grind enough, you have to, like, go... you have to, like, go back and just start fighting mons.

1837
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:59,500
But just naturally start fighting them now.

1838
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:00,800
Then I don't have to worry.

1839
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,760
Oh yeah, that's not it.

1840
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,620
That's not where I want to go.

1841
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:04,300
Alright!

1842
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,080
Where is... where does grandpa live again?

1843
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:13,340
No, that's not where he is.

1844
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:15,320
They were doing, like, mine chest or whatever there.

1845
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:16,640
I think here, right?

1846
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,260
Oh yeah, the content... yeah.

1847
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:27,160
But if I use content creator mode, I know my chat is gonna never let me live this... live through it.

1848
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:33,780
For the sake...

1849
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,200
For the sake...

1850
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:39,520
For the sake of my mental, I have to not use content creator mode.

1851
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,120
It would be 10 years later.

1852
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:49,240
If I'm still streaming 10 years later, they'll be like, Remember the time you tried to use content creator mode in Super Mario mode?

1853
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,560
I remember.

1854
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,720
Where the fuck does he live?

1855
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,180
Here?

1856
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,820
No, that's like the battle thing.

1857
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:58,780
Alright.

1858
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:03,910
Where the fuck?

1859
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:06,410
Where did he live?

1860
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:08,050
I checked every house.

1861
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,460
Oh my god, I don't remember.

1862
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:16,720
There's so many toad houses.

1863
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:17,880
They all look the same.

1864
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:21,480
No, that's like...

1865
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:22,800
That's where they were playing mind chess.

1866
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,260
And this is like...

1867
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:29,040
The 30 year old people.

1868
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,000
This is where the 30 year olds live.

1869
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,240
No, that's the Pokemon.

1870
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:33,800
I love Super Mario Bros 3.

1871
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:37,380
I love Super Mario Bros 3.

1872
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,080
Oh, there you go.

1873
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:40,180
I found your son.

1874
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:41,400
What's that?

1875
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,620
My son is alright?

1876
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:43,840
Thank you, Mario!

1877
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,300
Wait, that's it?

1878
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,560
I don't even get money?

1879
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:49,040
The fuck?

1880
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:50,880
I don't even get money for this quest?

1881
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,720
I found your fucking...

1882
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,960
He's your only son, I assume.

1883
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:56,320
I assume the other one's a daughter.

1884
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:58,260
He's the only son you care.

1885
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:00,200
And I get nothing out of it?

1886
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:01,340
That's...

1887
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:01,660
That's...

1888
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:02,940
I'm leaving him die in that cave.

1889
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:05,640
I'm getting my Monty Moe, too.

1890
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,920
Yeah, he's so ungrateful.

1891
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:11,600
Nice.

1892
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:12,140
Oh, yay!

1893
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,380
There are Monty here.

1894
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:16,560
Oh my god, it's Buzzy B!

1895
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,900
He must be really strong, right?

1896
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:21,680
He hates his son.

1897
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,040
No, he actually made...

1898
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,420
He doesn't love...

1899
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:27,260
No, I think a better thing is that he doesn't love him enough.

1900
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:30,760
Alright, how much...

1901
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,040
What is his type?

1902
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,100
Oh my god, he's so cute.

1903
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,260
Or she's so cute.

1904
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:43,620
Oh!

1905
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:45,260
Get in my ball!

1906
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:47,460
Or get in my cat!

1907
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:49,780
Oh, he's a dark type?

1908
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:50,880
Okay, we need dark type.

1909
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:51,980
Dark type is always good.

1910
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:55,040
I'll level you up later when I get an EXP share.

1911
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:57,620
Come on, get in here.

1912
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:03,810
Oh my god.

1913
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:07,290
Alright, let me tackle it.

1914
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:08,970
I can't be that strong, right?

1915
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:11,350
Oh, nice.

1916
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:12,050
Just enough.

1917
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:14,030
Just enough.

1918
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:15,250
Get in my cat!

1919
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:21,330
Yeah!

1920
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:26,330
Got a dark type!

1921
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:28,550
And I got EXP!

1922
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:29,170
Let's go!

1923
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:33,870
Nexy, you want to be Buzzy B?

1924
01:18:34,030 --> 01:18:34,990
Yeah, of course, Nexy!

1925
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:36,030
Thank you for the super chat!

1926
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:37,770
Thank you, thank you, Nexy Goon!

1927
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:40,370
A secluded turtle that lives in caves and sewers.

1928
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:41,030
It's hard.

1929
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:43,470
Capropage gives it fire resistance.

1930
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:46,650
Its sticky feet allows it to take refuge on ceilings.

1931
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:47,030
Alright.

1932
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:51,530
Nexy...

1933
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:56,210
Nexy...

1934
01:18:57,870 --> 01:18:58,310
Goon...

1935
01:18:58,310 --> 01:18:59,650
Where the fuck is the G?

1936
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:00,990
I don't know my alphabets.

1937
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:01,750
Oh, there...

1938
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:04,570
Goon...

1939
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:06,030
Where's the N?

1940
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:06,850
Oh, there it is.

1941
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:08,130
Alright.

1942
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:10,130
The Goonification.

1943
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:11,970
Wait, there has to be more down here, right?

1944
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:14,130
Is there the Monty Mole?

1945
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:15,270
I want the Monty Mole.

1946
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:17,030
Oh, no.

1947
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:17,410
It's just...

1948
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:19,630
Don't forget to hold...

1949
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:20,670
I thought that was a myth.

1950
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:21,930
That was an urban legend.

1951
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:24,390
Thank you for the super chat, V-Shark.

1952
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,410
Thank you, thank you.

1953
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:28,370
Don't worry.

1954
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:30,010
There's 150 of them.

1955
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:31,250
Oh, never mind.

1956
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:32,910
I guess I'm not fighting that.

1957
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:34,550
I wonder if there's more in this cave.

1958
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:37,890
Oh, my God.

1959
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:39,150
It's a Geodude.

1960
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:42,970
Another PC Pokemon.

1961
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:45,790
Okay, tackle.

1962
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:48,770
Okay, it's not very...

1963
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:49,470
I don't think fire...

1964
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:50,990
Fire is not...

1965
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:52,090
Um, excuse me.

1966
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:52,730
Oh, my God.

1967
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,250
It's legally distinct Geodude.

1968
01:19:57,630 --> 01:19:59,930
Put me on the bench, coach.

1969
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:01,170
Okay, tip.

1970
01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:02,970
Thank you for the super chat.

1971
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,270
Thank you, thank you.

1972
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:05,810
Oh, my God.

1973
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:08,450
I love my legally distinct Geodudes.

1974
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:12,530
The PC hunger is for more.

1975
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:15,610
All right.

1976
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:17,270
Let me just slowly tackle.

1977
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:22,430
Bro, what do you mean Rapism is a good move?

1978
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:23,630
It did, like, two damage.

1979
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:24,770
All right.

1980
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:25,330
Get in there.

1981
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:26,170
Get in my cap.

1982
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:32,470
All right.

1983
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:33,130
Yay!

1984
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:39,060
Bro, there.

1985
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:39,460
It's caught.

1986
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:41,800
What is it?

1987
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,900
A living boulder of eyes and arms.

1988
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:47,320
It rolls around, trampling plants and bugs in its path.

1989
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,280
In groups, it is known for its strong sense of camaraderie.

1990
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:53,080
Meep would like to join the Goon Cave.

1991
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,600
Another one to the Goon Cave.

1992
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:00,660
Back, axe, exiled.

1993
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:03,620
All right.

1994
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:04,240
Let's see.

1995
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,040
Tips.

1996
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:08,380
Tips, Goon.

1997
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:10,540
It's just like Digimon.

1998
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:16,300
I wish, like, I could just type this out instead of having to fucking write this.

1999
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:18,340
All right.

2000
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:18,840
Is there any more?

2001
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:21,660
Wait, is there the last sun?

2002
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:22,320
Heal me.

2003
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:23,460
Oh, okay.

2004
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:25,220
After this fight, heal me.

2005
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:30,790
All right.

2006
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:32,090
Get out of here.

2007
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:34,270
Out strong.

2008
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:34,910
Oh, my God.

2009
01:21:34,970 --> 01:21:35,870
These will take forever.

2010
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:36,270
Wait.

2011
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:37,330
He has Metal Claw?

2012
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:38,290
All right.

2013
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:38,850
Nexty.

2014
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:43,350
I'm gonna catch this and then release old Nexty.

2015
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:49,010
I think he might be better.

2016
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:49,690
All right.

2017
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:55,610
It's okay.

2018
01:21:57,170 --> 01:21:58,770
This is you, but better.

2019
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:01,350
Nexty too.

2020
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:02,270
All right.

2021
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:05,230
Wait.

2022
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:06,350
He's got Metal Claw.

2023
01:22:08,110 --> 01:22:08,750
No!

2024
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:10,350
He broke three!

2025
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:13,610
The Cooler Nexty.

2026
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:14,670
Okay.

2027
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:15,850
I might be able to tackle him.

2028
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:17,130
No!

2029
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:18,150
No!

2030
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:20,090
The Cooler Buzzy!

2031
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:21,170
No!

2032
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,450
It was just not meant to be.

2033
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:24,410
It was just not meant to be.

2034
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:25,890
Oh, my God.

2035
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:27,170
I killed it!

2036
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:30,830
Kaz, thank you for the super chat thing.

2037
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:31,670
Put me in.

2038
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:33,150
He's both just like me.

2039
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,290
Rest in peace.

2040
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:38,570
Nexty 2.0.

2041
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:40,950
All right.

2042
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:42,370
Oh, my...

2043
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:43,530
I walked three steps.

2044
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:45,590
I don't want to fight them because they took fucking forever.

2045
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:47,310
They take fucking forever to kill.

2046
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:49,710
Hey, guys.

2047
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:50,650
Thank you for the super chat.

2048
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:50,930
Thank you.

2049
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:51,550
Thank you.

2050
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:54,770
It didn't take fucking forever.

2051
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:55,950
Then I'd be fine.

2052
01:22:57,630 --> 01:22:58,190
All right.

2053
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:01,210
Let's go back in.

2054
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:06,230
Let's go here.

2055
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:08,010
There's anything...

2056
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:08,310
Oh, wait.

2057
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:09,450
Mario!

2058
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:10,830
I've been waiting for you!

2059
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:14,070
This warp pipe will lead you straight to Peach's Castle!

2060
01:23:14,370 --> 01:23:14,670
Nice.

2061
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:14,950
Okay.

2062
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:15,630
That's what I needed.

2063
01:23:16,370 --> 01:23:17,430
Is there anything here, though?

2064
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:21,830
Oh, that's true.

2065
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:22,290
I could get...

2066
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:22,830
I've never...

2067
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:23,050
Okay.

2068
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:27,950
I've never authentically encountered a Shiny in the wild before.

2069
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:32,010
Like, I played Pokemon games since, um...

2070
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:34,930
My very first Pokemon game was Crystal.

2071
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:40,390
And since Crystal, I've never encountered a single Shiny in the wild.

2072
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:41,910
I've only, like...

2073
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:46,310
The only time I've ever got a Shiny in-game was when I had to, like, actually breed for it.

2074
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:47,770
Hmm.

2075
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:48,230
Hmm.

2076
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:49,950
So the castle leads to one another!

2077
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:52,870
I wonder if there's any point in heading the west to another one!

2078
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:54,750
What the fuck?

2079
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:55,090
Wait.

2080
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:56,330
All of them just head here.

2081
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:00,750
They all just head here!

2082
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:03,310
Alright.

2083
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:04,210
Get out of here.

2084
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:10,690
My very first Shiny that I got was an Eevee.

2085
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,290
Because I wanted the Shiny Sylveon.

2086
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:14,270
Because Sylveon's, like, one of my...

2087
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:15,490
Uh, well, Shiny...

2088
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:16,730
I don't count Shiny Gyarados.

2089
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:19,190
Because, like, it's not, like, a naturally...

2090
01:24:19,190 --> 01:24:21,270
It's, like, a story set, you know?

2091
01:24:21,370 --> 01:24:22,430
Like, everybody...

2092
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:24,990
Everybody counters a Gyarados.

2093
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:27,170
Have I ever been here before?

2094
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:29,310
Mario!

2095
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:30,810
Are you participating in a Cap Challenge?

2096
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:33,330
If so, I think you may need this!

2097
01:24:36,570 --> 01:24:38,310
Yeah, I love Shiny Sylveon.

2098
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:39,410
A lot.

2099
01:24:39,670 --> 01:24:40,730
I think they're, like, one...

2100
01:24:40,730 --> 01:24:42,950
It's, like, one of the better Shiny colors.

2101
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:44,550
Uh, variants.

2102
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,510
Because there are some really fucking shitty ones.

2103
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:52,070
Like, I'm surprised Pikachu has such a shitty, shiny, alternative color.

2104
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:54,910
Because it's, like, you know, it's, like, the...

2105
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:56,970
Um, the, like, Pokemon mascot.

2106
01:24:57,290 --> 01:24:58,590
I think back then they weren't...

2107
01:24:58,590 --> 01:25:00,250
I mean, they could have, like, changed it.

2108
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:03,270
I know they're, like, well, that's what he was like in the first Pokemon game.

2109
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:04,770
But they can easily just change it.

2110
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,170
What do you know about type advantages?

2111
01:25:07,490 --> 01:25:08,350
It doesn't matter.

2112
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:10,870
If, as long as I'm stronger than you...

2113
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:13,090
I don't even care about type advantages.

2114
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:14,550
Oh my god, wait.

2115
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:15,430
This is a problem.

2116
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:17,870
He...

2117
01:25:17,870 --> 01:25:18,350
He...

2118
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:21,290
I say as he brings out a fucking Cheep Cheep.

2119
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:21,970
Okay.

2120
01:25:22,530 --> 01:25:23,130
Um...

2121
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:23,550
It's okay.

2122
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:24,410
I'm still stronger.

2123
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:25,270
I...

2124
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:26,690
I love...

2125
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:27,330
Look.

2126
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:28,770
I love...

2127
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:29,570
Oh, okay.

2128
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:30,150
Thank god.

2129
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:30,450
Okay.

2130
01:25:30,570 --> 01:25:30,970
That's okay.

2131
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:34,210
Like I said, type doesn't matter, guys.

2132
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:36,390
It doesn't matter.

2133
01:25:37,950 --> 01:25:38,550
No.

2134
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:42,690
That didn't mean to buy a fish.

2135
01:25:43,090 --> 01:25:43,850
Beanie?

2136
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:45,210
The fuck is...

2137
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:47,110
Where did Beanie come from?

2138
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:49,290
Which game is Beanie?

2139
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:53,650
Oh my god.

2140
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:54,830
He's a bean.

2141
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:59,270
What the hell is Beanie?

2142
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:00,650
It is...

2143
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:03,090
It's the famous Beanie, Doki.

2144
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:05,550
Superstar Saga?

2145
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:07,730
More than I do, it seems.

2146
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:11,330
Yeah, I brought a fucking Fire-type into a Water-type battle.

2147
01:26:13,890 --> 01:26:15,390
What's Superstar Saga?

2148
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:18,030
There's so many Ant Troopers everywhere.

2149
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:19,450
Don't worry.

2150
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:22,410
I'll make sure the population become endangered.

2151
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:24,830
Oh, it's an RPG game.

2152
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:25,170
Oh!

2153
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:27,190
I see.

2154
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:29,110
I never played any of the RPG ones.

2155
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:32,330
Oh, I paralyzed here.

2156
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:37,760
I never grew up with them.

2157
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:38,660
But I heard the...

2158
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:40,820
I heard the Mario Brothers ones.

2159
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:43,220
Like the Mario & Luigi ones are really good.

2160
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,380
I just never grew up with them.

2161
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:49,540
That's where I came from, right?

2162
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:50,360
Yeah, it is.

2163
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:53,900
We'll head here.

2164
01:26:57,530 --> 01:26:58,310
Go, Dad!

2165
01:26:58,470 --> 01:26:58,770
Go!

2166
01:26:59,050 --> 01:26:59,710
I never even...

2167
01:26:59,710 --> 01:27:01,030
I never even played Paper Mario.

2168
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:03,550
Yeah, I never played any of the Mario RPGs.

2169
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:04,650
Not even Paper Mario.

2170
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:06,950
Because I never had a game...

2171
01:27:06,950 --> 01:27:08,450
I didn't have a GameCube growing up.

2172
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:11,730
I had a GameCube when the lifespan was about to die.

2173
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:14,950
And that was the only time I've ever had a GameCube.

2174
01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:17,390
I already went here.

2175
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:18,510
I'm already lost.

2176
01:27:18,610 --> 01:27:19,150
I can't believe...

2177
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:21,770
I'm at World 1-2 and I already forgot which way I've been.

2178
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:24,370
Rogue, thank you for the super chat.

2179
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:24,670
Thank you.

2180
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:25,390
Thank you.

2181
01:27:28,930 --> 01:27:29,710
Peach's Castle.

2182
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:30,050
Alright!

2183
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:30,790
Yay!

2184
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:31,830
I'm gonna see my girlfriend!

2185
01:27:35,310 --> 01:27:35,750
Alright.

2186
01:27:36,490 --> 01:27:37,290
Yeah, guys.

2187
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:37,710
Uh-huh.

2188
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:40,750
I, Mario...

2189
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,250
Can have a girlfriend.

2190
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:43,450
And she's a princess.

2191
01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:45,390
Welcome, Mario!

2192
01:27:45,850 --> 01:27:46,870
Come to see a princess?

2193
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:48,470
She's right up ahead!

2194
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:51,990
Love fishing so much!

2195
01:27:52,230 --> 01:27:52,650
Oh, hey.

2196
01:27:52,710 --> 01:27:52,850
Nice.

2197
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:53,390
I got a ride.

2198
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:54,090
Oh my god.

2199
01:27:54,150 --> 01:27:54,870
You can get a Cheep Sheep.

2200
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:56,430
Is Cheep Sheep like the Magikarp?

2201
01:27:58,110 --> 01:28:00,550
The Magikarp of Mario?

2202
01:28:02,370 --> 01:28:03,030
Let's see.

2203
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:03,890
How do I...

2204
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:04,670
Register.

2205
01:28:05,290 --> 01:28:05,810
Select.

2206
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:06,370
Okay.

2207
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:06,850
Nice.

2208
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,070
Alright, I'm gonna catch myself a Cheep Sheep.

2209
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:10,910
Oh!

2210
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:14,430
Oh my god!

2211
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:15,190
It's Cheep Sheep!

2212
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:19,470
Alright, we need a water type anyway, so this works.

2213
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:20,830
Oh my god!

2214
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:21,830
And he's level 5!

2215
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:25,230
He's...

2216
01:28:25,230 --> 01:28:27,210
He's Cheep Sheep, but like...

2217
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:28,370
He's Magikarp, but better!

2218
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:31,750
Because he doesn't have only Splash...

2219
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:33,210
Oh, I should have bought more Plumber Caps.

2220
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:35,690
I can't believe like...

2221
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:36,870
I have to pay for these.

2222
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:38,930
Like this game that...

2223
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:39,450
Um...

2224
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:40,870
The princess is making me play.

2225
01:28:41,130 --> 01:28:43,710
And I just spend my own money on the materials.

2226
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:44,770
Oh, this is bad.

2227
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:45,070
Don't worry.

2228
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:45,490
He'll live.

2229
01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:46,570
He'll live.

2230
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:46,790
I believe.

2231
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:50,530
He'll live.

2232
01:28:52,510 --> 01:28:53,970
Okay, this is a little...

2233
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:54,650
Awkward.

2234
01:28:55,130 --> 01:28:55,850
But he'll live.

2235
01:28:55,990 --> 01:28:56,430
I believe.

2236
01:28:58,990 --> 01:29:01,090
Yeah, it's her way of increasing...

2237
01:29:01,090 --> 01:29:02,210
The economy.

2238
01:29:03,190 --> 01:29:04,970
I request to be Luffish.

2239
01:29:05,230 --> 01:29:05,510
Problem!

2240
01:29:05,930 --> 01:29:06,930
Thank you for the Super Chat.

2241
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:07,910
Thank you, thank you.

2242
01:29:08,150 --> 01:29:09,670
Alright, you'll be Pragoon.

2243
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:11,190
Yay!

2244
01:29:12,350 --> 01:29:13,190
Thank you for the Super Chat.

2245
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:14,270
Thank you, thank you.

2246
01:29:16,450 --> 01:29:17,310
Alright, nice.

2247
01:29:17,530 --> 01:29:17,690
Okay.

2248
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:19,010
That's a little...

2249
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:20,530
A little...

2250
01:29:20,530 --> 01:29:22,230
A little weak right now.

2251
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:24,470
Pragoon.

2252
01:29:24,590 --> 01:29:25,510
A big Luffish.

2253
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:29,290
Its wing-like fins allow it to leap out of the water to attack flying prey.

2254
01:29:29,290 --> 01:29:31,410
Okay, it frequents the water under bridges.

2255
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:32,850
Oh my gosh, my floor.

2256
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:34,690
I can feel it less.

2257
01:29:35,150 --> 01:29:37,130
I can feel it a bit sticky.

2258
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:38,070
Coy.

2259
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:42,790
No, my floor.

2260
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:46,490
Both lips.

2261
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:49,050
Someone's gonna have a good time.

2262
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:54,610
Okay, uh...

2263
01:29:56,170 --> 01:29:56,850
Pragoon.

2264
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:01,300
Hey, look.

2265
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,620
He wants to be pro...

2266
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:03,740
He wants to be a cheap...

2267
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:04,860
Let him live his life.

2268
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,260
I wonder if I can get another different type of fish.

2269
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:10,940
Oh, a butt!

2270
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:12,720
What kind of fish do I get?

2271
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,500
Oh, it's the same one.

2272
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:15,820
Okay, I'm leaving.

2273
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:17,920
That is not okay right now.

2274
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:19,180
I'm gonna leave.

2275
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:22,460
Yeah, I was gonna think...

2276
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:22,840
I thought...

2277
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:23,500
I was thinking like...

2278
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:24,500
Oh, it's because I have an old rod.

2279
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,540
I really like to use Biddy Buddies.

2280
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:27,600
They're my favorite.

2281
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:30,980
I'm disappointed I can have only six of them at a time.

2282
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:33,740
Your team looks rather tired.

2283
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:34,760
Yeah, and they rest.

2284
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,040
What is Mario gonna do with that fish, Toki?

2285
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,440
Well, I'm missing...

2286
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,040
I need like five more at first.

2287
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:47,900
Now, princess love to use captures found around her garden.

2288
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,540
I came from Saras Island.

2289
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:53,260
They asked Princess Peach where Princess Daisy went.

2290
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,980
Ever since the game started, she asked Bender...

2291
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:57,560
What did you do to Daisy, Peach?

2292
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:58,980
Where is Daisy?

2293
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:03,320
Dixon, thank you for the super chat.

2294
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:03,680
Thank you.

2295
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:04,400
Thank you.

2296
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:05,260
Hi, Toki.

2297
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:06,220
Today is my birthday.

2298
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:08,700
Have fun in the Easter holiday and keep going.

2299
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:10,100
Thank you for the super chat, Dixon.

2300
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:11,820
And because it's your birthday, don't worry.

2301
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:13,540
I'll name Mario Mon after you.

2302
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,800
And I'll exile you to the Goon Cave for your birthday present.

2303
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:18,720
Happy birthday to you.

2304
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,400
Happy birthday to you.

2305
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:22,180
Happy birthday, dear Dixon.

2306
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:23,960
Happy birthday to you.

2307
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:24,440
Yeah!

2308
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:28,340
So, Harry.

2309
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,920
I bet there's no sweat for you, Mario.

2310
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:32,540
Yoshi!

2311
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,300
Hey, Mario.

2312
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:37,700
You can ride a Yoshi unless you have a Yoshi whistle to summon one.

2313
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:41,340
Last I heard, someone in the Toe Town was giving them away.

2314
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:42,640
Wait, really?

2315
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:44,860
Nobody gave me a fucking Yoshi whistle.

2316
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,500
Oh, if I catch a Yoshi, that's the guy.

2317
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:48,700
I just need to catch a Yoshi.

2318
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:50,800
Is there anything here?

2319
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:51,680
Oh, nice.

2320
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:53,900
I got a berry juice.

2321
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,300
Dick Goon.

2322
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:56,840
Very unfortunate name.

2323
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:04,080
I just realized he's gonna be called Dick Goon.

2324
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:05,120
I'm sorry.

2325
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:08,140
Very unfortunate.

2326
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:09,760
Oh, no.

2327
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:14,260
My army of dragoons.

2328
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:19,220
Very unfortunate.

2329
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,920
Wait, why is it just an empty space?

2330
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:25,080
Is there an invisible item here?

2331
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:26,800
Oh my god, it's Beanie!

2332
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,420
That's the perfect Dick Goon.

2333
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,060
That shall...

2334
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:35,580
I shall call him Dick Goon.

2335
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,220
We got Beanie, guys.

2336
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:45,100
No, I don't have it.

2337
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:45,680
No, okay.

2338
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:46,520
I have to use these.

2339
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:49,820
We got the shift cap.

2340
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:50,940
Just what we needed.

2341
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:54,700
You get the...

2342
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:55,880
The good...

2343
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,620
His name is Richard Goon.

2344
01:32:57,880 --> 01:32:58,320
Dokey.

2345
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,320
Robin, thank you for the super chat.

2346
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:02,020
Thank you.

2347
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:02,820
Thank you.

2348
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:05,120
An overgrown sentient bean.

2349
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:08,120
His main method of attack is a trip-prone charge.

2350
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:11,380
Its grinning face is a popular icon of local culture.

2351
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:12,600
Alright, yes.

2352
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:13,780
I wonder if I...

2353
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:16,060
I should be able to name it because it's a ROM, right?

2354
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:17,380
There's no way they...

2355
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:19,640
There's no way they put limits on the ROM.

2356
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:25,780
Just right.

2357
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:27,400
My dick.

2358
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:28,780
Oh, I knew it!

2359
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:29,400
I knew it!

2360
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:29,980
Surely...

2361
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:31,040
Oh my god, it's allowed.

2362
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:31,960
Wait.

2363
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:32,780
How?

2364
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:35,280
What else am I allowed?

2365
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:37,880
Another rare cannon.

2366
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:38,540
Let's see.

2367
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:42,760
The system works, guys.

2368
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,620
I want to see what the XP level...

2369
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:45,820
Okay.

2370
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:47,740
I went until I leveled up before I do it.

2371
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:52,520
There's no fil...

2372
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:54,200
There's no filters in the old games?

2373
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:55,080
Not even one?

2374
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:57,540
Okay, let's run.

2375
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:59,560
I'm tired of grinding right now.

2376
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:00,580
I need...

2377
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:01,960
I don't have enough, like...

2378
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:02,680
Stuff anyway.

2379
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:03,860
Hey, it's Mario.

2380
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:04,680
Do you know me?

2381
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:06,360
Not yet, but you're about to.

2382
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,340
My name is Frank Otto.

2383
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:09,720
But you can call me Photo.

2384
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,220
I like to take pictures of people playing the Cap Challenge.

2385
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:13,860
Yes!

2386
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:14,540
Take a picture!

2387
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:16,300
Say cheese!

2388
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:20,480
Now how about Super Mario Super Jump for the camera?

2389
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:22,620
Oh!

2390
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:24,300
Just go to my account...

2391
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:27,500
Photocap.bsky.social...

2392
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:29,840
Oh wait, it's on bluesky.

2393
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:32,840
Peach's castles, where it all begins!

2394
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:34,080
Okay.

2395
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:34,660
Yoshi!

2396
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:35,680
Yoshi!

2397
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,000
Princess Peach loves to have Yoshis around the castle.

2398
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:40,880
Because we can be a bunch of different types.

2399
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:42,560
Oh my god, are they the Yoshis?

2400
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,420
Keep an eye out for the weird walks and the level details.

2401
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:50,180
There might be an item hiding there.

2402
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:51,800
Like, that one?

2403
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:54,280
Wait, is the account actually real?

2404
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:54,880
That's funny.

2405
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:57,700
Alright, I'm gonna only fight the ones that I can kill easily.

2406
01:34:57,860 --> 01:34:59,100
All of them are like...

2407
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:00,400
are like...

2408
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,880
not effective against fire.

2409
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:04,340
Oh nice, I got Super Shroom!

2410
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:11,280
Alright, if they say the same thing, I'm not gonna repeat it.

2411
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,940
I'm sorry, but this warp pipe is under maintenance!

2412
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:15,420
Alright.

2413
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:17,520
Makes sense.

2414
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:19,740
I don't think there's anything here.

2415
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:20,980
Oh wait, there's like...

2416
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:21,860
a ledge here.

2417
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,120
I think...

2418
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:23,780
I don't think that goes.

2419
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:24,680
That just goes backwards.

2420
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:26,660
Alright, I'm gonna see my girlfriend!

2421
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:29,520
Hello, my girlfriend!

2422
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:30,740
I love you!

2423
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:32,680
You're welcome, Mario!

2424
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,820
I hope the trip from your house wasn't too long.

2425
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:37,860
That's my girlfriend!

2426
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:39,780
Where's Luigi?

2427
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:41,880
I thought he would be with you.

2428
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:42,820
No, no.

2429
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:44,580
Let's not talk about my brother!

2430
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:45,780
Peach?

2431
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:48,760
I'm a hero, princess!

2432
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:50,920
Oh my god, there he is.

2433
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:52,860
Did I miss anything?

2434
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:54,180
Fuck you, Luigi.

2435
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:56,720
You're the reason why I spilled my iced tea.

2436
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,680
It's always Luigi's fault.

2437
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:00,200
Nothing at all.

2438
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:01,700
You're right on time.

2439
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,060
I believe today I built a team.

2440
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:06,240
Of course, princess.

2441
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:07,260
This is...

2442
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:09,860
Here is Bitey, Chuck, and Private.

2443
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:12,200
And we're gonna win the cap.

2444
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:15,680
You're the reason why my mom's left.

2445
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:17,900
And we're gonna win the cap challenge!

2446
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:19,400
Whatever it may be!

2447
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:22,760
What is it exactly?

2448
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:29,960
This is a challenge to see who is the smartest, wisest, and kindest leader in all the world.

2449
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:30,980
Oh, that's me!

2450
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,260
I'm especially really kind.

2451
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:38,000
Eight people from across the kingdom hold special power stars.

2452
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:41,980
The first person to click all five will be granted a wish.

2453
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:44,320
So it's a race!

2454
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:53,340
To prepare you both, my guards have put together a special test so you both can understand the little complexity of this game.

2455
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:57,700
Beat them all, and I'll reward you both for your first power star.

2456
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:00,360
What do you say, bro?

2457
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:01,720
Wanna test the...

2458
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:01,980
No.

2459
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:03,000
Sure!

2460
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:04,500
You take one hallway.

2461
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:05,340
I said no!

2462
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,200
And I'll take the other.

2463
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:08,840
Good luck to the...

2464
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,100
Get away from me, Luigi.

2465
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:13,920
This is what's supposed to be my special time with my girl.

2466
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,580
My brother and I want to try to play together.

2467
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:20,520
So we're ready to petition for siblings to act as the same commander.

2468
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:21,260
No.

2469
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:22,380
No.

2470
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:23,480
Oh, wait.

2471
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:23,680
Shit.

2472
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:24,660
I actually clicked yes.

2473
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:30,600
Thank you, Mario.

2474
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:32,540
God damn it.

2475
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:33,680
I was smashed.

2476
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,560
It, like, led me back to know.

2477
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:36,040
Yes.

2478
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:40,000
All right.

2479
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:40,820
Wait, what does this go?

2480
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:45,260
Did you see a Yoshi and the entire watermelon spit on the seeds?

2481
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,420
Just like this!

2482
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:49,320
I created TMs just so you're captured to try that, too!

2483
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:51,440
Guys, I got peer pressure.

2484
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:53,540
It always works.

2485
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:54,860
Wait, what is it?

2486
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:55,780
It was TM51.

2487
01:37:56,420 --> 01:37:57,200
Oh, yeah!

2488
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,750
I feel just like...

2489
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:02,130
Wait, is there a physical special split?

2490
01:38:02,230 --> 01:38:03,910
Or is this a type-based in this game?

2491
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:05,430
All right.

2492
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:06,390
Oh, it's a bullet seed?

2493
01:38:06,670 --> 01:38:07,490
Oh, that makes sense.

2494
01:38:07,850 --> 01:38:07,990
All right.

2495
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:08,970
I go right, yeah?

2496
01:38:11,790 --> 01:38:12,610
Where does he go?

2497
01:38:12,610 --> 01:38:13,830
Oh, boy, oh, boy!

2498
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:16,010
I get to be catamander, not a capture!

2499
01:38:17,150 --> 01:38:21,190
Ever since we started a cap challenge, the princess has become more active around the castle!

2500
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:22,030
Oh, my gosh.

2501
01:38:22,110 --> 01:38:23,530
She actually does her job now?

2502
01:38:24,430 --> 01:38:28,390
You think the princess patched up the ultra shortcut through the garden?

2503
01:38:28,590 --> 01:38:29,450
Oh, there's a shortcut!

2504
01:38:30,670 --> 01:38:32,970
I'm sniffing out for the wish that the princess is offering.

2505
01:38:33,170 --> 01:38:34,430
What do you mean I'm a capture?

2506
01:38:35,270 --> 01:38:39,170
I don't think you can BLJ your winter princess this time!

2507
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:41,090
Wait, what's BLJ?

2508
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:44,810
Let me show you!

2509
01:38:44,990 --> 01:38:45,310
Okay.

2510
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:54,800
Oh, is that the one where you have to mash the button?

2511
01:38:55,460 --> 01:38:56,720
In the...

2512
01:38:57,580 --> 01:38:58,440
What is that game called?

2513
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:00,820
The Mario 64?

2514
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:01,380
Yeah.

2515
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:03,940
Is that the Mario 64 tech?

2516
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:09,660
Wait, he has a speed boost?

2517
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:10,580
How...

2518
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:11,720
I'm already slow.

2519
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:13,060
I fucking walk!

2520
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:15,000
I'm a bomb!

2521
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:16,800
But bomb is no run!

2522
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:21,140
Oh, he's using Cheep Cheep.

2523
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:23,700
Water types won't stop me!

2524
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,880
Oh, he's level 6.

2525
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:26,200
Okay.

2526
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:31,580
Water types can't stop me!

2527
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:34,200
That's right!

2528
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:36,900
Get out of here!

2529
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,820
I think I'm scared!

2530
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:47,100
I don't need to use anybody else!

2531
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:49,940
You'll live!

2532
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:53,560
That's right!

2533
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:56,820
I told you you'd live!

2534
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,140
Always believe in him.

2535
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:07,240
Hello to the other halfway to defeat the other challenge!

2536
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:07,840
Alright.

2537
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:09,280
Let me go...

2538
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,100
Let me go...

2539
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:13,180
Make sure he does not die.

2540
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:15,220
Let me...

2541
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:16,320
Let me...

2542
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,880
Let me make sure he's...

2543
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:21,080
Let me make sure I, you know, restore his HP a little bit.

2544
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,140
Yeah, he's fucking tough as shit.

2545
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:28,200
Alright, let's go.

2546
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:32,520
I didn't really calculate anything.

2547
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:33,660
I just believed.

2548
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:36,620
All you have to do is believe.

2549
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:39,840
I'm trying to stock up as many items as I can!

2550
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:40,560
No sharing!

2551
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:45,200
I came to Peach's Castle in hopes of getting a job as a court shaman.

2552
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:46,880
But Toad's return me down.

2553
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:49,240
Why does he get to make so many cars?

2554
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:51,620
Master Mario!

2555
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:53,720
It seems like you have not finished your lesson!

2556
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:56,140
Come back once you have completed it!

2557
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:57,020
Wait, where did...

2558
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:58,400
Alright.

2559
01:40:59,000 --> 01:40:59,900
You have to go here?

2560
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:03,860
I've been using Taldex!

2561
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:06,080
I got so much useful information!

2562
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,400
Like showing what modes a capture can learn!

2563
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:10,280
Alright, cool.

2564
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:11,400
Oh, I went backwards.

2565
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:13,480
Let me show you!

2566
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:15,280
Okay, items changed how bad...

2567
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,540
I also don't use items.

2568
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:18,240
Unless it's like full restore.

2569
01:41:24,690 --> 01:41:25,430
Oh, wait.

2570
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:27,050
What is Toad's worst voice?

2571
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:28,750
Is he just like a normal man?

2572
01:41:30,650 --> 01:41:33,810
I thought all Toad's had like the same voice.

2573
01:41:37,830 --> 01:41:39,190
He just sounds old?

2574
01:41:39,370 --> 01:41:39,650
Okay.

2575
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:41,010
That's easy.

2576
01:41:41,730 --> 01:41:42,190
Thank God.

2577
01:41:45,810 --> 01:41:46,830
Where's secrets?

2578
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:49,790
Oh, flame charge!

2579
01:41:49,970 --> 01:41:50,190
Yes.

2580
01:41:50,510 --> 01:41:50,890
Actually.

2581
01:41:51,130 --> 01:41:52,350
Is it a power move?

2582
01:41:52,610 --> 01:41:53,530
Oh, it is.

2583
01:41:53,530 --> 01:41:55,770
Okay, we're gonna get rid of charge.

2584
01:41:58,230 --> 01:41:59,830
One, two, and poof!

2585
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:02,250
We ain't learning no stats here.

2586
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:05,190
Stat moves do not exist in my game.

2587
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:08,810
Not all Toad's.

2588
01:42:08,930 --> 01:42:09,650
Oh my God!

2589
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:10,450
It's Spike!

2590
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:11,730
I want a Spike!

2591
01:42:12,590 --> 01:42:13,710
Wait, what type are you?

2592
01:42:17,710 --> 01:42:18,530
Oh my God.

2593
01:42:18,530 --> 01:42:19,350
And I'm strong too.

2594
01:42:19,450 --> 01:42:20,050
And I'm...

2595
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:20,370
Oh my God.

2596
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:21,610
I'm finally like...

2597
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:23,330
I'm now doing a brisk walk.

2598
01:42:23,490 --> 01:42:24,390
Instead of just a walk.

2599
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:25,570
Oh.

2600
01:42:28,230 --> 01:42:28,910
That's it?

2601
01:42:28,990 --> 01:42:29,990
That's like one damage.

2602
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:31,950
Okay, it's not stopping.

2603
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:33,390
Okay, you can stop now.

2604
01:42:34,890 --> 01:42:35,670
It's like...

2605
01:42:35,670 --> 01:42:36,970
It's just one damage.

2606
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:38,670
He says as he fucking...

2607
01:42:38,670 --> 01:42:39,670
Chucks three more.

2608
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:43,230
All right.

2609
01:42:46,010 --> 01:42:46,810
Berries are yummy.

2610
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:47,470
Am I right?

2611
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:49,410
Yes, Toad.

2612
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:50,410
Berries are yummy.

2613
01:42:51,090 --> 01:42:51,350
All right.

2614
01:42:51,410 --> 01:42:52,110
Complete it both.

2615
01:42:55,530 --> 01:42:56,030
All right.

2616
01:42:56,090 --> 01:42:57,210
Let me...

2617
01:42:57,850 --> 01:42:58,590
Check this.

2618
01:42:58,750 --> 01:42:59,710
I want to talk to him.

2619
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:01,410
Hey, Bits, are guarding it?

2620
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:03,170
There's a bunch of strong captures there.

2621
01:43:03,730 --> 01:43:04,750
Where is the garden?

2622
01:43:05,470 --> 01:43:07,630
I assume the garden is deeper in the cast.

2623
01:43:07,730 --> 01:43:08,650
Wait, if it's...

2624
01:43:08,650 --> 01:43:10,130
I need to find a store.

2625
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:11,470
Master Mario.

2626
01:43:11,930 --> 01:43:13,750
Swell job making it to me.

2627
01:43:14,270 --> 01:43:15,870
Here, let me heal your minds.

2628
01:43:16,510 --> 01:43:17,010
Your captures.

2629
01:43:17,870 --> 01:43:20,590
Now then, I believe we understand what is unfolding.

2630
01:43:21,410 --> 01:43:23,830
Mind you, I am no pushover.

2631
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:26,830
So hope you have taken notes from your previous battles.

2632
01:43:26,990 --> 01:43:28,390
Wait, I have to fight an old man?

2633
01:43:28,710 --> 01:43:30,210
I have to fight a 40-year-old?

2634
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:31,370
I'm sorry.

2635
01:43:31,550 --> 01:43:32,150
I'm sorry.

2636
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:32,870
I'm sorry.

2637
01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:35,930
Shall we begin?

2638
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:37,810
Shall we begin?

2639
01:43:39,690 --> 01:43:42,310
Gentleman Toads would like to battle.

2640
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:51,650
I didn't come here to be...

2641
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:53,470
Oh my god, it's a shy guy.

2642
01:43:53,890 --> 01:43:55,050
Wait, that's a little wrong.

2643
01:43:55,370 --> 01:43:58,110
Because like, at least like, they're humanoid shape.

2644
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:05,690
What the fu- Oh, it's not very- Yeah, it's a bug move.

2645
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:09,630
Yeah, like, he's- This is a little bit more wrong.

2646
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:15,880
How queer.

2647
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:16,980
I've been stabbed.

2648
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:20,200
Wait, my controller DC'd.

2649
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:23,160
Okay, there we go.

2650
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:23,780
Now it's back.

2651
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:24,500
Alright.

2652
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:26,700
Use recharge.

2653
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:27,560
Get in there.

2654
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:29,900
And like, there it said, USB disconnected.

2655
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:30,780
I was like, oh no.

2656
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,220
Alright, send in another one.

2657
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:35,880
Monty Mo- What's he gonna do?

2658
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:39,220
Yeah, but they're toads.

2659
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:40,600
Like, he doesn't have- Look.

2660
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:44,900
Like, Koopas don't have the name- The word guy in it.

2661
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:45,680
Yeah.

2662
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:53,000
That was the strongest grass attack in the game.

2663
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:58,120
Look, this is why we did not get- Per- Like, we did not get the piranha plant, guys.

2664
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:04,720
Like, no matter what, grass type is always like, the weakest shit in the starters, I feel.

2665
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:10,100
I feel like it's never worth it getting a grass type.

2666
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:17,720
The only time I've ever, uh, picked up a grass starter was for, uh, Snivy.

2667
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:19,460
That was the only time.

2668
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:20,760
I mean, cause like, look at him.

2669
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:28,760
Like, I mean, look at Sn- I mean, I think every- I think Snivy was like, the best looking one out of all the starters.

2670
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,200
I was about to use Fang?

2671
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:37,240
Wait, which one's Fang?

2672
01:45:41,190 --> 01:45:41,750
Oh!

2673
01:45:43,150 --> 01:45:45,070
It seems on my last legs.

2674
01:45:45,310 --> 01:45:47,590
Very well- Oh my god, look at him!

2675
01:45:47,690 --> 01:45:49,070
He's mostly eyes!

2676
01:45:50,190 --> 01:45:51,630
Oh, that's cute!

2677
01:45:53,370 --> 01:45:56,010
Oh my god, it's Legally Distinct Zubat!

2678
01:46:00,820 --> 01:46:01,760
Alright, goodbye.

2679
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,080
Oh my god, he's level eight.

2680
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:05,520
Oh shit.

2681
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:09,260
Oh my god, it is- He's Zubat if he had eyes.

2682
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:11,840
He took his eyes, guys.

2683
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:15,020
I will not falter!

2684
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:16,200
For the princess!

2685
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:17,300
For Doki!

2686
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:19,620
Next thing they give us Super Chat.

2687
01:46:19,780 --> 01:46:20,580
Thank you, thank you.

2688
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:26,360
Um, what do you think about Meow-Scarada?

2689
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:28,400
Skarada?

2690
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:34,340
Okay, I've- No, I haven't played a game where, like, those- I don't remember what the three starters look like.

2691
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:36,940
I just- Uh, I know one looked like a cat.

2692
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:39,760
Which was what Meow-Scarada was.

2693
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:41,720
And, um...

2694
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:52,000
I remember I saw a clip of, like, the cat, like, getting out of bed as if it's like- It's a person, so it's like- And then I was like, oh my god, that Pokemon just looks like she could pay rent.

2695
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:57,800
Like, like, cause it's like- Cause it's like, you know, they're your pets, right?

2696
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:03,680
But then, like, in the Pokemon anime, she just moves around as if, like, she was, like, a human person.

2697
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:04,980
Like, in the bed.

2698
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:09,120
And then it's like, I'm like, oh my god, at this point, she should pay rent.

2699
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:13,860
You know, it would, like, she's, like, legally, like, basically, like, humanoid enough.

2700
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:21,820
Well done.

2701
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:23,620
Allow me to heal your party.

2702
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,400
Yeah, she should be paying taxes.

2703
01:47:30,540 --> 01:47:32,160
Now then, the princess is waiting.

2704
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:34,800
Talk to her and you will earn your first Power Star.

2705
01:47:35,020 --> 01:47:36,760
Oh my god, this is my first Shin battle!

2706
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:39,240
Hello, princess.

2707
01:47:40,540 --> 01:47:42,220
Congratulations on completing the test.

2708
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:45,100
I hope Toezeret didn't give you a rough time.

2709
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,880
My sincerest apologies, princess.

2710
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:52,120
For I was unable to defeat Master Mario and Master Luigi.

2711
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:53,920
That's quite alright.

2712
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:58,760
Now, on the topic of Power Starts, let's go, it's Mario- Oh, wait, is it Bowser?

2713
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,140
Never mind, it's Bowser time.

2714
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:02,920
What was that noise?

2715
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:05,860
Oh my god!

2716
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:07,380
It's Abracadabra!

2717
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:09,060
I don't know his name.

2718
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:09,940
Come back!

2719
01:48:09,940 --> 01:48:10,760
Ahem.

2720
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:13,040
Introducing his royal highness.

2721
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:15,860
The Scroogey Eyes and Nostros.

2722
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:18,080
The king of the Koopas!

2723
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:19,420
King!

2724
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:21,140
Peach!

2725
01:48:21,740 --> 01:48:23,520
Peaches, peaches, peaches.

2726
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:26,980
So I am an outcast again, huh?

2727
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:30,280
What did I do to deserve it this time?

2728
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:33,220
Shall I read off the list?

2729
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,340
Can it blabby?

2730
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:39,200
I've been on a good streak for a while now.

2731
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:41,720
I haven't kidnapped you in how long?

2732
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:43,040
Four days!

2733
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:44,800
And I'm going through a trial.

2734
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:50,260
I'm really trying here.

2735
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:54,520
Right, and now, you're hosting this party and I'm not invited.

2736
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:57,140
I have to hear about this from Junior.

2737
01:48:57,580 --> 01:48:59,620
You told his son and not him.

2738
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:00,480
That's fucked up.

2739
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:03,600
Imagine, like, your son knows about this and not you.

2740
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:04,720
Junior!

2741
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:10,460
You gave a power sword to my boy, Junior, instead of me?

2742
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:13,360
That's actually really fucked up.

2743
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:17,120
Oh my god, new perso fest.

2744
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:18,860
A whole four days.

2745
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:21,500
Alright, um, well, you see.

2746
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:25,140
That's because you're a commander too.

2747
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:28,480
You're one of the best commanders in the whole world.

2748
01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:30,420
Surely you have to find out yourself.

2749
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:35,340
Princess, I don't think he's going to buy that.

2750
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:35,920
Woohoo!

2751
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:38,020
Give him a moment.

2752
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:42,380
Don't worry.

2753
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:44,200
He'd be like...

2754
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:49,660
You finally admit how awesome and amazing my skills are?

2755
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:50,460
Don't worry.

2756
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:52,100
He's so, like, peach cord.

2757
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:54,520
Like, he'd believe anything she'll say.

2758
01:49:55,780 --> 01:49:57,180
Alright, I'll play.

2759
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:01,160
Let me gather my platoons and mop the floor of this party.

2760
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:04,220
I'm sorry, but that's against the rules.

2761
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:05,360
There are rules?

2762
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:07,740
How was I supposed to know that?

2763
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:10,900
But, sire, if I may interject.

2764
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:13,400
You have...

2765
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:14,600
You have the floor.

2766
01:50:15,260 --> 01:50:16,020
No need.

2767
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:17,380
I'm already on it.

2768
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:21,160
Toads were sent out pamphlets explaining how everything plays.

2769
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:23,980
I've been reading it to the prince for bedtime.

2770
01:50:24,780 --> 01:50:25,600
Hand it over.

2771
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:27,400
Yes, sire.

2772
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:29,140
So you see here...

2773
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:30,800
Only up to six...

2774
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,520
Only up to six captures.

2775
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:34,420
Explains here.

2776
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:36,340
You see that rule?

2777
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:38,480
I'm gonna choose to ignore it.

2778
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:41,560
Sire, certainly you just...

2779
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:43,480
Wait, how come he gets to have seven?

2780
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:45,900
Imagine it brings, like, a hundred.

2781
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:47,340
Too bad.

2782
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:51,180
If that disqualifies me, then I win by my own means.

2783
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,200
Oh my god, he's just like me.

2784
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:54,200
For real, for real.

2785
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:57,820
Mario, I'm gonna make an example out of you.

2786
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:00,800
Be careful, bro.

2787
01:51:02,180 --> 01:51:04,180
Bowser can be plotting anything.

2788
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,840
This is what happens when you don't invite me to your...

2789
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,600
Wait, how does he have captures now?

2790
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:11,080
He just got...

2791
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:12,900
Did he just, like, bring out...

2792
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:13,520
He, like...

2793
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:14,060
Oh my god.

2794
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:16,600
He, like, brought out, like, his men out here?

2795
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,960
He just, like, dragged three from his army.

2796
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:21,660
He's like, you!

2797
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:25,940
Alright, get out of here.

2798
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:29,200
Bowser, my husband.

2799
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,760
And he still has a level three.

2800
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:36,640
He just, like, picked one up from his army.

2801
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:38,080
And you're like, wear this hat!

2802
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:39,100
What?

2803
01:51:39,180 --> 01:51:40,440
That was, like, one hit!

2804
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:42,260
No.

2805
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:44,040
I'll dad you all.

2806
01:51:45,060 --> 01:51:46,000
Wait, that's...

2807
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:46,840
Oh my god, wait.

2808
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:47,940
What the fuck?

2809
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:48,640
Toadie?

2810
01:51:48,860 --> 01:51:49,960
Who the fuck is Toadie?

2811
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:50,520
Toadie!

2812
01:51:50,860 --> 01:51:52,360
Where did he come from?

2813
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:55,640
He has a Doraemon helicopter.

2814
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:58,260
That's a child.

2815
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:03,100
Oh wait, is he flying type?

2816
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:06,780
Oh, I've never played Yoshi Island before.

2817
01:52:13,170 --> 01:52:13,650
Alright.

2818
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:14,270
Nice!

2819
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:16,010
Thanks for helping me level up, Bowser.

2820
01:52:16,030 --> 01:52:17,390
I really appreciate it.

2821
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:19,510
Alright.

2822
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:20,530
What is he gonna send out?

2823
01:52:20,590 --> 01:52:21,630
Wait, did he send him himself?

2824
01:52:21,630 --> 01:52:22,790
Wait, what the fuck?

2825
01:52:22,930 --> 01:52:23,470
That's illegal.

2826
01:52:23,970 --> 01:52:24,990
You can just...

2827
01:52:27,410 --> 01:52:28,910
You can just do that?

2828
01:52:29,790 --> 01:52:30,830
No more playing!

2829
01:52:31,030 --> 01:52:32,150
Wait, can I catch Bowser?

2830
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:40,320
Wait, it's not very effective?

2831
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:41,540
What type are you?

2832
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:42,960
Oh no.

2833
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:43,600
Oh no.

2834
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:45,040
I think he's ground type.

2835
01:52:45,620 --> 01:52:46,060
Oh no.

2836
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:47,400
Don't worry.

2837
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:49,680
Okay, wait.

2838
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:50,860
No, I think...

2839
01:52:50,860 --> 01:52:51,700
Okay, I need a...

2840
01:52:51,700 --> 01:52:52,760
Oh, this is bad.

2841
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:53,640
This...

2842
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:56,840
This is bad.

2843
01:52:57,100 --> 01:52:58,160
Oh, this is bad.

2844
01:52:58,320 --> 01:52:58,680
I...

2845
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,460
I don't have...

2846
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:02,140
I don't have any...

2847
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:02,960
Oh...

2848
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:04,980
This is not good.

2849
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:05,920
Oh...

2850
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:08,100
Oh no.

2851
01:53:08,380 --> 01:53:08,780
Oh wait.

2852
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:09,500
Okay, he's weak.

2853
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:10,000
He's weak.

2854
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:10,700
Okay, we're fine.

2855
01:53:11,380 --> 01:53:12,420
I can...

2856
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:14,240
It's fine.

2857
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:16,280
As long as it doesn't get...

2858
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:18,400
Okay, I'll use it when we're almost there.

2859
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:20,180
When we're almost...

2860
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:23,800
No, it's weak.

2861
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:25,420
Fire is weak.

2862
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:27,660
All right.

2863
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:28,560
Don't worry.

2864
01:53:28,980 --> 01:53:30,360
I can take this.

2865
01:53:30,660 --> 01:53:32,280
I can take it all.

2866
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:33,360
Go, Dad.

2867
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:33,820
Go.

2868
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:36,300
Go, Dad.

2869
01:53:36,540 --> 01:53:36,680
Go.

2870
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:37,760
Keep taking it.

2871
01:53:40,060 --> 01:53:40,680
Okay.

2872
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:42,500
I think...

2873
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:43,660
I think it's time.

2874
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:45,020
It's time.

2875
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:48,760
Yippee!

2876
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:50,360
No!

2877
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:55,040
Did I just lose to my own minions?

2878
01:53:56,360 --> 01:53:57,560
It's time.

2879
01:53:57,560 --> 01:53:58,780
And I did it.

2880
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:01,820
What?

2881
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:02,960
But how?

2882
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:06,840
I can go XP for that?

2883
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:07,220
Go!

2884
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:14,340
Next, you think it was a super chat that you think you...

2885
01:54:14,340 --> 01:54:14,940
Oh, I forgot.

2886
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:16,400
I forgot.

2887
01:54:16,620 --> 01:54:17,600
Don't get XP.

2888
01:54:19,900 --> 01:54:23,740
You need to treat your party with love and affection.

2889
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:30,220
I literally self-destructed my only strong mod.

2890
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:32,180
But it was out of love.

2891
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:37,320
No, I think it's because he doesn't know how to play yet.

2892
01:54:37,780 --> 01:54:40,420
I don't recall asking you, Green Sash.

2893
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:42,380
And I can play perfectly fine.

2894
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,880
I just need to get some training in.

2895
01:54:45,180 --> 01:54:46,360
Yeah, that's it.

2896
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:51,740
Since Kaman knows this game by the book already, he's gonna be my cap challenge tactician.

2897
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:55,060
This is the last time you've seen a me.

2898
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:56,760
Mark my words.

2899
01:54:57,020 --> 01:54:58,640
Your wish will be mine, Peach.

2900
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,200
Bah-ha-ha.

2901
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:04,520
Kaman, lift yourself off the floor.

2902
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,440
We got some scheming to do.

2903
01:55:07,220 --> 01:55:08,340
Yes, my liege.

2904
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:09,700
All right, goodbye.

2905
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:11,400
Goodbye.

2906
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:13,060
Toadsworth?

2907
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:14,180
Yes, Princess?

2908
01:55:15,320 --> 01:55:15,880
Junior?

2909
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:19,500
Princess, this party was hastened effort.

2910
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:22,480
I won't decide to exclude Bowser and Kamek.

2911
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:24,640
Let's have a discussion about that later.

2912
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:27,020
Don't worry, Princess.

2913
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:30,600
We'll get the Power Stars before Bowser does.

2914
01:55:31,020 --> 01:55:32,500
I know you both will.

2915
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:37,080
Which reminds me, you still need the Power Star from the Mushroom Kingdom.

2916
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:40,540
There's only one more battle you need to win to get there.

2917
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:42,700
That's right.

2918
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:45,640
You hold the Mushroom Kingdom Power Star.

2919
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:48,520
I'll only fight one of you at a time.

2920
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:50,780
So decide who wants to challenge me first.

2921
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:51,920
Hey, bro.

2922
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,720
I'm still a little shaken from Bowser.

2923
01:55:54,820 --> 01:55:57,140
So you can fight the princess first.

2924
01:55:58,280 --> 01:55:58,880
Yeah.

2925
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:00,960
I'll heal your captures too.

2926
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:03,340
All right, time to...

2927
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:04,760
Time to kill the princess.

2928
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:08,640
Show her that I'm a man.

2929
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:10,720
That's-a me, Mario.

2930
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:13,840
I am Princess Peach of the Mushroom Kingdom.

2931
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:15,620
And I accept your challenge.

2932
01:56:16,540 --> 01:56:17,720
That's our bro.

2933
01:56:18,980 --> 01:56:19,800
All right.

2934
01:56:20,380 --> 01:56:21,660
You saw what I did.

2935
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:24,940
You knew that I showed no mercy.

2936
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:27,800
Let's see how you handle the star leader.

2937
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:29,940
Oh my gosh, she's so cute.

2938
01:56:30,860 --> 01:56:32,140
I love her.

2939
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:33,920
I love her like pixel art.

2940
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:39,080
All right.

2941
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:39,880
Get out of here.

2942
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:41,000
That's a bug type.

2943
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:43,540
I ain't no afraid of no bug.

2944
01:56:43,660 --> 01:56:44,700
Wait, that's not a bug type?

2945
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:47,820
Wait, what type are you?

2946
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:50,100
But you look like a bug.

2947
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:52,480
Yeah, the sprites are really good.

2948
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:53,840
That's also what I miss.

2949
01:56:54,940 --> 01:56:55,820
And like...

2950
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:57,040
Is this a fairy type?

2951
01:56:57,160 --> 01:56:57,880
Because he's using...

2952
01:56:57,880 --> 01:56:58,380
Is it normal?

2953
01:56:58,980 --> 01:57:00,600
But he's like a ladybug.

2954
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:05,920
But this is what I miss about the newer Pokemon games.

2955
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:08,120
That they don't do like...

2956
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:09,200
They don't do pixel art anymore.

2957
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:12,040
And like the 3D models are so boring.

2958
01:57:12,220 --> 01:57:13,160
Especially animations.

2959
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:17,400
Oh wait, baby Yoshi?

2960
01:57:19,140 --> 01:57:20,720
What does a baby Yoshi look like?

2961
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:24,260
Oh my

2962
01:57:28,510 --> 01:57:31,890
little chungus boy.

2963
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:38,890
He's not gonna be such...

2964
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:39,670
He's just...

2965
01:57:39,670 --> 01:57:43,250
He looks like he definitely...

2966
01:57:45,870 --> 01:57:47,290
He's not there.

2967
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:49,350
He's not there mentally right now.

2968
01:57:49,710 --> 01:57:51,810
Yeah, why is his eyes like that?

2969
01:57:54,030 --> 01:57:55,730
Oh, is this a normal type gym?

2970
01:57:55,910 --> 01:57:56,310
Oh my god.

2971
01:57:56,410 --> 01:57:57,470
I want a baby Yoshi.

2972
01:57:58,570 --> 01:57:59,630
Bro is eating...

2973
01:57:59,630 --> 01:58:00,350
Yo, bro is...

2974
01:58:00,350 --> 01:58:03,710
Bro is ordering Wendy's at 4 in the morning right now.

2975
01:58:07,910 --> 01:58:09,010
Okay, this is bad.

2976
01:58:09,270 --> 01:58:11,150
The baby Yoshi is sort of kicking my ass.

2977
01:58:11,350 --> 01:58:12,650
But he's a baby!

2978
01:58:14,350 --> 01:58:15,770
Oh, this is bad.

2979
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:17,310
Don't worry.

2980
01:58:17,430 --> 01:58:18,370
I can live for one more.

2981
01:58:18,610 --> 01:58:19,470
One more hit.

2982
01:58:19,610 --> 01:58:20,790
And then I'll eat a berry.

2983
01:58:22,830 --> 01:58:23,770
I'll be fine.

2984
01:58:26,430 --> 01:58:26,970
Okay.

2985
01:58:27,330 --> 01:58:27,990
Let's see.

2986
01:58:28,330 --> 01:58:30,870
I should have like an extra berry.

2987
01:58:33,930 --> 01:58:35,010
20 HP.

2988
01:58:36,450 --> 01:58:37,670
Okay, I have berry juice.

2989
01:58:37,870 --> 01:58:38,670
Alright, get in there.

2990
01:58:39,570 --> 01:58:41,350
The others will not survive.

2991
01:58:46,150 --> 01:58:47,110
The others...

2992
01:58:47,110 --> 01:58:48,590
They're not gonna make it.

2993
01:58:48,730 --> 01:58:49,130
You're...

2994
01:58:49,130 --> 01:58:50,910
Oh wait, there's a mushroom here.

2995
01:58:51,090 --> 01:58:52,570
Oh, the mushroom heals too!

2996
01:58:52,950 --> 01:58:53,090
Oh.

2997
01:58:55,090 --> 01:58:55,470
Alright.

2998
01:58:58,650 --> 01:59:00,230
Any tackle will be better?

2999
01:59:00,470 --> 01:59:02,290
I thought flame charge is a stronger move.

3000
01:59:04,770 --> 01:59:05,250
Alright.

3001
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:09,190
I don't want to waste my thing.

3002
01:59:10,130 --> 01:59:11,050
Oh my god.

3003
01:59:11,210 --> 01:59:12,450
That was so much XP.

3004
01:59:13,510 --> 01:59:13,650
Okay.

3005
01:59:14,090 --> 01:59:14,730
Don't worry.

3006
01:59:16,290 --> 01:59:17,130
Crazy D.

3007
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:18,230
Oh, I can...

3008
01:59:18,230 --> 01:59:19,310
I can one-shot him.

3009
01:59:20,410 --> 01:59:22,070
La la la la la la.

3010
01:59:22,350 --> 01:59:23,230
I believe.

3011
01:59:24,450 --> 01:59:26,810
Okay, but like how much do I believe?

3012
01:59:26,990 --> 01:59:28,650
This is a 50-50 right now.

3013
01:59:29,030 --> 01:59:29,670
Do I...

3014
01:59:34,850 --> 01:59:36,750
He looks like a grass type.

3015
01:59:36,970 --> 01:59:37,750
What's up?

3016
01:59:38,870 --> 01:59:39,350
Okay.

3017
01:59:39,850 --> 01:59:41,830
I was like, okay, do I risk it?

3018
01:59:42,010 --> 01:59:42,630
Do I...

3019
01:59:42,630 --> 01:59:43,850
I don't need to...

3020
01:59:43,850 --> 01:59:46,610
I was like, this is an actual gamble right now.

3021
01:59:47,730 --> 01:59:48,470
What's that?

3022
01:59:50,110 --> 01:59:51,470
Oh, it's not that bad.

3023
01:59:52,590 --> 01:59:53,330
Alright, nice.

3024
01:59:53,470 --> 01:59:54,170
It wasn't that bad.

3025
01:59:55,190 --> 01:59:56,010
Alright, get in there.

3026
01:59:56,550 --> 01:59:58,870
I only got one move and it's flame charge.

3027
01:59:59,090 --> 01:59:59,430
Oh, I...

3028
01:59:59,430 --> 01:59:59,690
Okay.

3029
02:00:00,690 --> 02:00:01,410
Oh no.

3030
02:00:02,130 --> 02:00:03,090
I'm already asleep.

3031
02:00:03,230 --> 02:00:04,010
That's fucking right.

3032
02:00:05,390 --> 02:00:05,870
Stupid.

3033
02:00:06,730 --> 02:00:07,790
I'm already asleep.

3034
02:00:09,410 --> 02:00:10,070
It's okay.

3035
02:00:10,090 --> 02:00:10,870
I can't tank that.

3036
02:00:10,990 --> 02:00:11,510
It's not okay.

3037
02:00:11,810 --> 02:00:12,090
It's okay.

3038
02:00:12,090 --> 02:00:12,870
I have another mushroom.

3039
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:19,420
Guys, I cannot keep blowing things up, guys.

3040
02:00:19,580 --> 02:00:20,800
I need to actually...

3041
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:23,680
Guys, my strat cannot just be blowing things up.

3042
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:24,900
I actually need the XP.

3043
02:00:25,100 --> 02:00:25,400
I...

3044
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:27,420
Wake up!

3045
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:28,320
No!

3046
02:00:29,100 --> 02:00:30,220
Oh my god.

3047
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:30,600
Okay.

3048
02:00:30,980 --> 02:00:31,280
Okay.

3049
02:00:31,420 --> 02:00:32,520
I'm not risking it.

3050
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:33,160
I'm not...

3051
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:35,220
I'm not risking it.

3052
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:37,620
Please.

3053
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:39,820
Please wake up, dad!

3054
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,160
Wake up!

3055
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:44,840
How are you still asleep?

3056
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:48,680
How?

3057
02:00:49,820 --> 02:00:50,780
Oh my god.

3058
02:00:50,860 --> 02:00:51,360
You woke up.

3059
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:53,540
Oh my god.

3060
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:54,380
I should have used charge.

3061
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:55,560
God damn it.

3062
02:00:55,660 --> 02:00:56,580
I thought...

3063
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:58,420
I thought I wouldn't wake up.

3064
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:01,460
It's okay.

3065
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:05,180
I did not want to send my other mons out.

3066
02:01:05,620 --> 02:01:05,840
Yay!

3067
02:01:06,140 --> 02:01:06,740
I should have leveled up.

3068
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:07,200
Yay!

3069
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:08,600
I'm level 14!

3070
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:10,640
Oh my god.

3071
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:11,700
Nappy time over.

3072
02:01:14,020 --> 02:01:14,520
Okay.

3073
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:15,690
That is like...

3074
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:19,620
Guys.

3075
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:23,100
These stats do not look...

3076
02:01:23,100 --> 02:01:24,820
These stats are actually like...

3077
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:26,480
A glass cannon right now.

3078
02:01:27,860 --> 02:01:28,420
Like...

3079
02:01:31,580 --> 02:01:33,680
If I kill everything...

3080
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:35,560
If I kill everything...

3081
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:36,580
Then it will be fine.

3082
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:38,920
As long as I kill everything...

3083
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:39,960
It will be fine.

3084
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:44,580
If they don't hit me first...

3085
02:01:44,580 --> 02:01:45,500
Then it should be okay.

3086
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:48,460
Yeah.

3087
02:01:48,660 --> 02:01:49,680
We're just here to one shot.

3088
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:52,120
Don't need HP if everything dies.

3089
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:53,900
Oh, did I lose?

3090
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:54,880
Yay!

3091
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,780
A thousand dollars for my girlfriend.

3092
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:57,480
Oh my god!

3093
02:01:57,600 --> 02:01:58,280
Dad's evolving!

3094
02:01:58,480 --> 02:01:59,400
What if I just stopped it?

3095
02:01:59,500 --> 02:01:59,960
I was like...

3096
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:00,160
No!

3097
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:00,680
No!

3098
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:03,780
Yay!

3099
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:05,380
What did he evolve to?

3100
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:09,920
What do you look like?

3101
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:14,840
What the fuck is that?

3102
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:17,320
Is this a bomber man?

3103
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:19,120
Chuck Yaw?

3104
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:21,100
I should have stopped it.

3105
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:22,680
Alright, shit.

3106
02:02:23,740 --> 02:02:25,020
What are you?

3107
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:27,820
What do you have?

3108
02:02:27,940 --> 02:02:29,360
Where did your legs go?

3109
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:30,740
Where did you...

3110
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:32,940
Oh, is it from Mario 64?

3111
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:35,400
Where did your legs go?

3112
02:02:35,580 --> 02:02:36,920
I should have hit B.

3113
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:38,720
Where did your foot...

3114
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:39,040
No!

3115
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:42,700
He's fighting!

3116
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:44,440
No!

3117
02:02:45,660 --> 02:02:48,400
It's fire fighting!

3118
02:02:50,660 --> 02:02:51,360
No!

3119
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:57,580
Fire fighting, Chris.

3120
02:02:58,360 --> 02:03:02,040
You can never escape fire fighting.

3121
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:03,180
No!

3122
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:12,960
Wow, even in Super Mario Kart, the firefighting curse continues every time.

3123
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:22,760
Mario, you see the Mushroom Kingdom Power Star.

3124
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:24,880
You can never escape.

3125
02:03:26,820 --> 02:03:31,140
With this Power Star, you'll be able to rally and motivate higher level teammates.

3126
02:03:31,140 --> 02:03:34,880
On top of that, I'd like to give you something that could help your team out.

3127
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:35,740
Oh, nice.

3128
02:03:35,980 --> 02:03:37,220
A TM that I'll never use.

3129
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:41,440
Mario, put away.

3130
02:03:41,780 --> 02:03:45,080
What I just give you is a training module, or TM for short.

3131
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:48,180
It's a video that teaches your creatures how to use special moves.

3132
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:49,820
This one is called Charm.

3133
02:03:50,080 --> 02:03:51,360
I have one more thing for you.

3134
02:03:51,480 --> 02:03:52,520
Hold on just a moment.

3135
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:54,020
Oh, it's my Power Star!

3136
02:03:55,700 --> 02:03:57,220
Oh, it's a Yoshi egg!

3137
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:00,640
Here, Mario.

3138
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:02,180
Take this Yoshi egg.

3139
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:03,960
I think that you'll raise them well.

3140
02:04:04,180 --> 02:04:06,640
Oh my god, I got a Yoshi egg!

3141
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:08,120
Yeah!

3142
02:04:09,640 --> 02:04:10,640
Okay, Luigi.

3143
02:04:11,120 --> 02:04:12,060
Now it's your turn.

3144
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:13,040
Are you ready?

3145
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:15,560
Ready as I ever be, princess!

3146
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:19,280
I'll catch up with you later, Mario.

3147
02:04:20,180 --> 02:04:20,840
Alright, goodbye.

3148
02:04:21,160 --> 02:04:21,780
Can I watch?

3149
02:04:22,720 --> 02:04:23,640
Alright, bro.

3150
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:24,800
Wish me luck!

3151
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:27,960
Okay, that's the castle.

3152
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:29,780
Okay, I need a...

3153
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:31,040
Is there a store near me?

3154
02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:32,400
Do I have to go all...

3155
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:33,440
Oh my god.

3156
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:34,980
Alright, guys.

3157
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:38,840
I need to go all the way back to...

3158
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:40,640
Uh, to the town.

3159
02:04:41,180 --> 02:04:42,060
Because I...

3160
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:43,860
Yeah...

3161
02:04:43,860 --> 02:04:44,200
Fuck!

3162
02:04:44,860 --> 02:04:46,820
Oh, I don't have any more caps!

3163
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:48,280
God dammit!

3164
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:48,920
I wanna catch...

3165
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:50,440
I wanna catch some...

3166
02:04:50,440 --> 02:04:52,660
He said there was like a lot of really cool mons.

3167
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:54,100
In the...

3168
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:54,840
Princess castle...

3169
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:55,860
Gardens.

3170
02:04:57,980 --> 02:04:59,140
You have to...

3171
02:04:59,140 --> 02:05:00,460
Go buy some caps.

3172
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:03,700
I'm glad I copped to you, Master Mario.

3173
02:05:04,220 --> 02:05:06,740
Here, I have some gadgets just arrived from Professor E.

3174
02:05:06,860 --> 02:05:07,120
Gag.

3175
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:07,960
Oh my god.

3176
02:05:08,120 --> 02:05:10,480
Finally, Mother Mons can actually be strong.

3177
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:12,400
The PSS...

3178
02:05:13,220 --> 02:05:14,040
What's the piss?

3179
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:19,920
The first device will distribute XP to even party members that don't participate in battle.

3180
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:22,220
Oh, you can also turn it off and on as you please.

3181
02:05:22,660 --> 02:05:27,220
The second device will allow you to access the capture storage network from wherever you please.

3182
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:28,320
Oh!

3183
02:05:28,620 --> 02:05:30,980
Press the art button while viewing your current button.

3184
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:32,500
Oh, that's so convenient!

3185
02:05:33,740 --> 02:05:34,660
I say...

3186
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:36,120
What does he mean by an art button?

3187
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:37,560
Oh, that's actually...

3188
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:38,660
So convenient!

3189
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:40,400
I can literally...

3190
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,620
It should be fully operational by now.

3191
02:05:42,820 --> 02:05:45,520
I can just like replace my mods whenever I want.

3192
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:56,120
Oh my god, that's like the original one from Pokemon.

3193
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:02,980
I love that one.

3194
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:07,300
You can use it to return to Toad Sound, Warp Zone, Post Ace.

3195
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:12,100
From there, I believe the Warp to World 2 should be open for you to continue on your journey.

3196
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:13,960
Best of luck, Master Mario!

3197
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:18,080
Alright, let's go buy some caps and go steal some...

3198
02:06:18,700 --> 02:06:20,800
Steal some henchmen for my team.

3199
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:21,880
Wait, what the fuck?

3200
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:24,260
Oh, are these like...

3201
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:24,920
Oh!

3202
02:06:26,620 --> 02:06:27,060
Oh!

3203
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:28,240
I see!

3204
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:29,480
Those are all the portos.

3205
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:36,680
Okay, let's get...

3206
02:06:37,460 --> 02:06:38,560
How many can I get?

3207
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:39,300
30?

3208
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,200
Fuck it, let's spend it all.

3209
02:06:42,100 --> 02:06:42,500
Yeah.

3210
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:44,120
I don't need anything else.

3211
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:45,280
Alright!

3212
02:06:46,780 --> 02:06:47,960
What is my...

3213
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:48,920
Are they full HP now?

3214
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:49,640
Oh no, they're not.

3215
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:50,100
I have to heal.

3216
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:52,040
Okay, let me heal real quick.

3217
02:06:52,860 --> 02:06:53,840
Wait, that's not the healers.

3218
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:56,440
Yeah, so like, I can...

3219
02:06:56,440 --> 02:06:57,280
That's where it's...

3220
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:59,420
Like, it takes me to each world, I believe.

3221
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,340
Alright, let's go to Peach's World.

3222
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:19,560
It's pink, just like Peach.

3223
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,120
Oh, I had to grab my Yoshi!

3224
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:23,520
Where was it?

3225
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:27,460
Uh...

3226
02:07:27,460 --> 02:07:28,500
How did I grab it?

3227
02:07:28,700 --> 02:07:29,660
It's in my pockets, right?

3228
02:07:30,420 --> 02:07:32,140
Oh, and then Rare Candy, too.

3229
02:07:33,940 --> 02:07:34,340
Alright.

3230
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:35,100
Oh no, it's in it!

3231
02:07:35,180 --> 02:07:35,660
It's already in!

3232
02:07:37,140 --> 02:07:38,060
I already have it.

3233
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:46,320
While the curse of firefighting got you, there's still a chance that Dad could evolve into the king of the bombs.

3234
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:47,240
Oh my god, please.

3235
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:48,560
Please, I...

3236
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:50,980
I don't want firefighting.

3237
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:52,920
Rogue, thank you for the super chat!

3238
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:53,540
I think it's the...

3239
02:07:53,540 --> 02:07:54,100
I can't!

3240
02:07:54,680 --> 02:07:55,200
Please!

3241
02:07:55,420 --> 02:07:56,440
Break that curse!

3242
02:07:56,580 --> 02:07:57,140
Oh yeah, I should.

3243
02:07:57,480 --> 02:07:58,580
I should give him my XP.

3244
02:07:58,840 --> 02:07:59,520
Wait, guys!

3245
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:01,540
With the XP share?

3246
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:04,720
Um...

3247
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:08,000
Does it mean it takes less XP from my...

3248
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:08,400
Oh wait.

3249
02:08:09,140 --> 02:08:12,040
Does it take less XP from, like, my...

3250
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:13,160
My main...

3251
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:13,680
From Dad?

3252
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:14,960
Or...

3253
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:15,740
Um...

3254
02:08:15,740 --> 02:08:16,660
Does it distribute it?

3255
02:08:16,740 --> 02:08:17,240
Does it not?

3256
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:18,640
I need to know.

3257
02:08:18,780 --> 02:08:19,300
That's important.

3258
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:20,140
Okay, okay.

3259
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:21,820
Because if it does, I'll turn it off.

3260
02:08:23,580 --> 02:08:24,300
It shouldn't?

3261
02:08:24,440 --> 02:08:25,080
Okay, that's good.

3262
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:30,660
Oh my god, it's Beanie again.

3263
02:08:31,160 --> 02:08:31,840
Wait, I already...

3264
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:33,400
I thought they said I'll get rare mons.

3265
02:08:34,020 --> 02:08:35,320
I fucking gave me Beanie.

3266
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:38,120
Alright, get out of here, Beanie.

3267
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:39,400
We already have one.

3268
02:08:42,620 --> 02:08:42,980
Nice.

3269
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:44,660
Is that evenly?

3270
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:46,220
Okay, I just don't want it...

3271
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:50,800
I just don't want it to, like...

3272
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:50,920
Uh...

3273
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:53,880
Oh my god, everybody's actually finally getting fed now.

3274
02:08:54,160 --> 02:08:54,980
You know, like...

3275
02:08:54,980 --> 02:08:55,920
It's like, please...

3276
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:56,680
Can I please...

3277
02:08:56,680 --> 02:08:57,200
Can you please...

3278
02:08:57,200 --> 02:08:58,600
Oh, you ready to hatch?

3279
02:08:58,760 --> 02:08:59,920
That's so fast!

3280
02:09:10,620 --> 02:09:11,360
No, like...

3281
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:12,080
I'm just gonna name you...

3282
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:12,300
I'm just gonna name you...

3283
02:09:12,300 --> 02:09:13,640
I'm gonna name you Regular Dragoon.

3284
02:09:13,640 --> 02:09:14,880
Alright, this...

3285
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:16,340
He gets to be...

3286
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:17,540
Just a Dragoon.

3287
02:09:18,900 --> 02:09:20,420
He'll be all of you.

3288
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:22,900
You all get to be him.

3289
02:09:27,740 --> 02:09:30,280
You all get to be Dragoon.

3290
02:09:35,540 --> 02:09:36,180
Okay.

3291
02:09:37,940 --> 02:09:39,260
It's you guys!

3292
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:40,420
Guys, it's you!

3293
02:09:40,780 --> 02:09:42,400
We are all Yoshi!

3294
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:45,620
What the fuck is that?

3295
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:46,960
Okay...

3296
02:09:47,640 --> 02:09:48,160
Nippers...

3297
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:49,080
Okay...

3298
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:51,660
Let me use Spark.

3299
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:53,540
I'm scared I'm gonna, like, destroy him.

3300
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:56,440
That's me!

3301
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:57,380
There you guys are!

3302
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:57,660
See?

3303
02:09:57,780 --> 02:09:59,080
Everyone can be...

3304
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:00,720
Everybody can be...

3305
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:02,640
Can be a Dragoon.

3306
02:10:04,100 --> 02:10:04,640
Alright, nice.

3307
02:10:04,780 --> 02:10:05,320
Oh, that's good.

3308
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:06,560
I can catch you.

3309
02:10:10,420 --> 02:10:11,700
Where's my Pokeballs?

3310
02:10:14,380 --> 02:10:15,800
Alright, there is...

3311
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:15,940
Caps.

3312
02:10:16,160 --> 02:10:16,340
There we go.

3313
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:16,760
Oh, wait.

3314
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:17,920
A baseball cap.

3315
02:10:18,820 --> 02:10:19,900
Oh, it's a higher...

3316
02:10:19,900 --> 02:10:21,220
No, we're not using any of that.

3317
02:10:21,820 --> 02:10:23,340
We're only using plumber caps.

3318
02:10:25,580 --> 02:10:26,500
Alright, nice.

3319
02:10:27,400 --> 02:10:27,820
Husky!

3320
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:28,820
Thank you for the super chat.

3321
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:29,600
Thank you, thank you.

3322
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:31,340
This one, whatever is first found in the...

3323
02:10:31,340 --> 02:10:31,560
Okay.

3324
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:33,920
You get to be a husk goon.

3325
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:35,300
Nice.

3326
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:36,600
He should have named you.

3327
02:10:37,060 --> 02:10:37,880
That's simple.

3328
02:10:38,060 --> 02:10:39,220
Thank you for the super chat.

3329
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:40,340
Thank you, thank you.

3330
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:43,460
Finally, you are fed.

3331
02:10:43,680 --> 02:10:44,780
My goons.

3332
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:47,120
You can all be fed now.

3333
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:51,120
Oh my god.

3334
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:52,400
They're all like...

3335
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:54,760
Thank you, Toki, for finally feeding me.

3336
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:56,420
I was so hungry.

3337
02:10:56,960 --> 02:11:00,240
Oh my god.

3338
02:11:00,420 --> 02:11:01,520
I was so hungry.

3339
02:11:01,740 --> 02:11:02,200
Thank you.

3340
02:11:05,100 --> 02:11:05,660
Alright.

3341
02:11:08,380 --> 02:11:08,940
Nice.

3342
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:09,460
Oh my god.

3343
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:10,680
He's still leveling up.

3344
02:11:10,680 --> 02:11:15,840
A tiny little plant is known to walk around, leap into the air, and even breathe fire.

3345
02:11:16,140 --> 02:11:18,900
It does this to protect itself while it's still in its infancy.

3346
02:11:19,900 --> 02:11:20,860
Nom nom nom nom.

3347
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:21,400
Alright.

3348
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:22,600
Let's see.

3349
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:24,360
Husk.

3350
02:11:24,540 --> 02:11:25,760
Wait, can I do husky?

3351
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:26,920
Or is that...

3352
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:28,600
H-U-S-K-Y-G...

3353
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:29,040
Oh, I can!

3354
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:29,520
Nice.

3355
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:31,620
H...

3356
02:11:32,820 --> 02:11:33,340
U...

3357
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:34,920
S...

3358
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:36,180
K...

3359
02:11:36,180 --> 02:11:36,780
Oh.

3360
02:11:37,060 --> 02:11:37,440
Oops.

3361
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:39,800
Y...

3362
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:41,780
T-O-O-N.

3363
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:42,380
There you go.

3364
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:44,000
Alright.

3365
02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:45,720
Exiled into the...

3366
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:46,800
Wait, actually...

3367
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:47,900
Where's the R button?

3368
02:11:50,040 --> 02:11:50,820
Wait, what?

3369
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:53,000
How do I...

3370
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,780
Wait, how do I...

3371
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:57,320
How do I open this?

3372
02:11:57,860 --> 02:11:59,100
Where's my R button?

3373
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:01,360
Okay, clearly...

3374
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:04,080
I don't think I have my R button registered.

3375
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:05,200
I'll just do that.

3376
02:12:05,820 --> 02:12:06,140
Alright.

3377
02:12:06,460 --> 02:12:07,180
E-gags.

3378
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:08,460
Okay.

3379
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:10,060
I wanna know like...

3380
02:12:10,060 --> 02:12:10,200
Alright.

3381
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:11,100
This is...

3382
02:12:11,100 --> 02:12:11,780
What are my types?

3383
02:12:12,040 --> 02:12:13,000
What do I have in here?

3384
02:12:13,860 --> 02:12:14,120
Alright.

3385
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:15,020
Dick Goon?

3386
02:12:15,060 --> 02:12:15,440
I'm sorry.

3387
02:12:15,460 --> 02:12:16,380
But I'm uncomfortable.

3388
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:21,520
I'm gonna put a plan in here.

3389
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:21,940
I'll put...

3390
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:22,740
I'll put a...

3391
02:12:22,740 --> 02:12:24,000
I'll put a husky goon.

3392
02:12:24,380 --> 02:12:24,600
Alright.

3393
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:26,540
I'm sorry, little guy.

3394
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:27,980
I'm uncomfortable.

3395
02:12:27,980 --> 02:12:29,640
Are you in the party?

3396
02:12:33,660 --> 02:12:34,200
No...

3397
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:35,540
No beanies allowed.

3398
02:12:36,140 --> 02:12:36,680
No...

3399
02:12:36,680 --> 02:12:37,560
No...

3400
02:12:38,220 --> 02:12:38,760
Sorry.

3401
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:39,380
I can't...

3402
02:12:39,380 --> 02:12:41,360
I don't want any beans in my...

3403
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:42,120
In my team.

3404
02:12:45,380 --> 02:12:46,160
Hey guys.

3405
02:12:46,280 --> 02:12:47,060
Thank you for the super chat.

3406
02:12:47,180 --> 02:12:47,400
Thank you.

3407
02:12:48,060 --> 02:12:49,040
Tim's on the...

3408
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:49,740
The ghost.

3409
02:12:50,100 --> 02:12:50,740
Alright guys.

3410
02:12:50,900 --> 02:12:51,720
It's all...

3411
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:52,980
Russian Roulette.

3412
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:53,720
It's randomized.

3413
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:56,040
You don't get to pick which one.

3414
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:01,720
It's like...

3415
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:02,620
You get chosen.

3416
02:13:03,860 --> 02:13:04,960
You don't have a choice.

3417
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:06,160
But you get chosen.

3418
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:08,400
Um...

3419
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:09,420
P, thank you for the super chat.

3420
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:09,740
Thank you.

3421
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:10,180
Thank you.

3422
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:11,120
Dips to be a bullet.

3423
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:12,060
If you catch one.

3424
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:13,900
Don't worry if you're lucky.

3425
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:14,260
Oh wait.

3426
02:13:14,380 --> 02:13:14,600
Dragon.

3427
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:14,980
Wait.

3428
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:15,440
Bubble.

3429
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:18,000
Um...

3430
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:18,900
I'll put a tail whip.

3431
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:19,500
Oh my god.

3432
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:20,500
It has like a little...

3433
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:21,440
The sound effect too.

3434
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:24,840
Dragoons are in bubble.

3435
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:27,780
It's destiny.

3436
02:13:28,060 --> 02:13:28,440
That's right.

3437
02:13:28,660 --> 02:13:30,760
Whatever you get is your destiny.

3438
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:35,020
On his birthday.

3439
02:13:35,380 --> 02:13:37,000
I exiled Diggoon.

3440
02:13:37,720 --> 02:13:39,160
On his birthday.

3441
02:13:39,480 --> 02:13:39,740
Look.

3442
02:13:39,900 --> 02:13:41,360
It's not my fault.

3443
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:43,220
That the first...

3444
02:13:43,220 --> 02:13:44,320
Mario mod.

3445
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:45,380
I encountered.

3446
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:46,380
Was Beanie.

3447
02:13:46,940 --> 02:13:47,600
Look guys.

3448
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:49,340
How is that my fault?

3449
02:13:50,460 --> 02:13:50,820
What?

3450
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:52,620
Wait.

3451
02:13:52,780 --> 02:13:53,860
Send out the baby Yoshi.

3452
02:13:53,880 --> 02:13:55,520
It's got a funny back sprite.

3453
02:13:55,700 --> 02:13:55,860
Okay.

3454
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:56,920
I'll see what it looks like.

3455
02:13:58,060 --> 02:13:58,420
Uh...

3456
02:13:58,420 --> 02:13:58,520
Read.

3457
02:13:58,620 --> 02:13:59,460
Thank you for the super chat.

3458
02:13:59,580 --> 02:13:59,840
Thank you.

3459
02:14:02,780 --> 02:14:04,620
Justice for Diggoon.

3460
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:06,320
Alright.

3461
02:14:06,380 --> 02:14:06,760
Let's see.

3462
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:10,600
I wonder how I can...

3463
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:11,400
Cause it's gonna be...

3464
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:12,100
It's like the Eevee.

3465
02:14:12,220 --> 02:14:12,380
Right?

3466
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:14,260
I wonder how...

3467
02:14:14,260 --> 02:14:15,280
Alright.

3468
02:14:15,340 --> 02:14:16,120
How does it look like?

3469
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:18,140
How does this baby look like?

3470
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:19,000
Before he dies?

3471
02:14:23,130 --> 02:14:23,930
Oh my god.

3472
02:14:24,010 --> 02:14:24,570
It's a bull!

3473
02:14:37,290 --> 02:14:38,790
I'm a little uncomfortable.

3474
02:14:44,710 --> 02:14:46,150
What if I flash?

3475
02:14:51,710 --> 02:14:52,710
Use flash!

3476
02:14:52,710 --> 02:14:53,730
Oh my god.

3477
02:14:53,730 --> 02:14:53,930
No.

3478
02:14:54,250 --> 02:14:54,850
No.

3479
02:14:54,950 --> 02:14:56,450
Don't look at me like this.

3480
02:14:56,790 --> 02:14:58,510
You were bored like...

3481
02:14:58,510 --> 02:15:00,210
30 minutes ago.

3482
02:15:00,430 --> 02:15:01,910
Don't look at me like that.

3483
02:15:02,190 --> 02:15:02,710
And don't...

3484
02:15:03,330 --> 02:15:04,770
Oh my god.

3485
02:15:05,550 --> 02:15:05,910
Oh my god.

3486
02:15:06,050 --> 02:15:07,010
Let's do the cinema.

3487
02:15:08,670 --> 02:15:09,270
Me.

3488
02:15:12,010 --> 02:15:13,150
Oh no.

3489
02:15:16,010 --> 02:15:17,930
That's you, by the way, chat.

3490
02:15:18,230 --> 02:15:18,830
That's you.

3491
02:15:19,150 --> 02:15:22,290
Aphelia, thank you for the five gifted chips.

3492
02:15:22,290 --> 02:15:22,910
Thank you.

3493
02:15:23,090 --> 02:15:23,670
Thank you.

3494
02:15:24,090 --> 02:15:24,690
Thank you.

3495
02:15:25,050 --> 02:15:26,630
You're welcome, chat.

3496
02:15:27,770 --> 02:15:28,170
Alright.

3497
02:15:28,410 --> 02:15:29,050
Please tell me.

3498
02:15:29,590 --> 02:15:29,910
No!

3499
02:15:30,270 --> 02:15:30,550
No!

3500
02:15:31,050 --> 02:15:32,110
I killed him!

3501
02:15:34,350 --> 02:15:35,690
You know, it's for the best.

3502
02:15:35,910 --> 02:15:36,930
It's for the best.

3503
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:38,490
We saw things today.

3504
02:15:39,190 --> 02:15:41,870
Bro's got the smug look of superiority.

3505
02:15:42,550 --> 02:15:43,890
Azura, thank you for the super chat.

3506
02:15:43,970 --> 02:15:44,210
Thank you.

3507
02:15:44,350 --> 02:15:44,650
Thank you.

3508
02:15:44,750 --> 02:15:46,070
Thank you for the super chat.

3509
02:15:46,210 --> 02:15:46,510
Thank you.

3510
02:15:46,630 --> 02:15:47,170
Thank you.

3511
02:15:47,170 --> 02:15:48,450
Uh...

3512
02:15:48,450 --> 02:15:50,530
Kuma, if you catch the boo, name it, man.

3513
02:15:50,710 --> 02:15:51,150
Well...

3514
02:15:51,150 --> 02:15:51,870
She's dead.

3515
02:15:56,270 --> 02:15:58,510
What the fuck is that?

3516
02:15:59,010 --> 02:15:59,730
Oh my...

3517
02:15:59,730 --> 02:16:00,390
Kill it!

3518
02:16:00,790 --> 02:16:03,210
Oh, I forgot you were in first up.

3519
02:16:03,470 --> 02:16:05,730
Oh, I forgot all about it.

3520
02:16:06,190 --> 02:16:07,630
Oh my god.

3521
02:16:07,630 --> 02:16:07,690
What?

3522
02:16:08,870 --> 02:16:09,510
Yep.

3523
02:16:09,770 --> 02:16:10,770
That's the way dragons.

3524
02:16:11,190 --> 02:16:11,910
Look at Toki.

3525
02:16:12,510 --> 02:16:13,910
Not so dead.

3526
02:16:14,150 --> 02:16:15,450
Put him away.

3527
02:16:15,850 --> 02:16:17,990
I forgot you were the first one.

3528
02:16:19,550 --> 02:16:20,190
Alright.

3529
02:16:20,610 --> 02:16:23,090
There's no way I one shot this guy, right?

3530
02:16:24,150 --> 02:16:25,110
Okay, nice.

3531
02:16:32,880 --> 02:16:35,460
I didn't first kill him this time, guys.

3532
02:16:35,720 --> 02:16:36,140
I did it.

3533
02:16:36,340 --> 02:16:37,280
I did the bare minimum.

3534
02:16:41,180 --> 02:16:41,660
Wait.

3535
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:44,780
Who was the one that was like...

3536
02:16:45,620 --> 02:16:46,260
Let's see.

3537
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:48,980
Dibs on the ghost?

3538
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:49,340
Alright.

3539
02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:49,920
Hey, guys.

3540
02:16:50,340 --> 02:16:50,640
Don't worry.

3541
02:16:50,700 --> 02:16:51,660
You get something better.

3542
02:16:52,420 --> 02:16:52,900
Sprangler.

3543
02:16:55,460 --> 02:16:56,260
Don't worry.

3544
02:16:56,260 --> 02:16:56,880
Alright.

3545
02:16:57,300 --> 02:16:59,440
A large stripy spider.

3546
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:02,320
It hangs from ceilings by a thread of strong webbing.

3547
02:17:02,460 --> 02:17:06,060
It swings back and forth like a pendulum in order to disorientate its prey.

3548
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:08,400
You got something even better than a boo.

3549
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,480
Hey, good.

3550
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:13,880
I told you.

3551
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,460
Whatever you get is your destiny.

3552
02:17:17,360 --> 02:17:18,420
Hey, good.

3553
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:22,400
Alright.

3554
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:22,500
Alright.

3555
02:17:26,660 --> 02:17:27,100
Nice.

3556
02:17:27,420 --> 02:17:27,860
Exiled.

3557
02:17:28,020 --> 02:17:28,840
As it should be.

3558
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:29,760
As...

3559
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:30,740
Oh, you're right.

3560
02:17:30,860 --> 02:17:31,000
Okay.

3561
02:17:31,080 --> 02:17:33,840
If we catch a boo, we'll name it a whisper goon.

3562
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:35,700
Oh my god.

3563
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:36,320
You're so right.

3564
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:36,820
Oh my god.

3565
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:38,900
Why is there so many nips here?

3566
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:40,780
Oh my god.

3567
02:17:40,880 --> 02:17:41,720
I need a...

3568
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:42,340
I need a...

3569
02:17:42,340 --> 02:17:43,300
Okay, we're running.

3570
02:17:43,560 --> 02:17:44,660
I need to fix my...

3571
02:17:44,660 --> 02:17:45,320
I need a...

3572
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:46,800
I don't...

3573
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:47,600
I can't.

3574
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:48,600
I can't.

3575
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:50,360
Get back.

3576
02:17:50,720 --> 02:17:52,600
Get back at my sixth slot.

3577
02:17:52,600 --> 02:17:52,700
What?

3578
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:56,780
You get...

3579
02:17:56,780 --> 02:17:57,680
You're in the...

3580
02:17:57,680 --> 02:17:59,960
You're bounding to the sixth slot.

3581
02:18:00,140 --> 02:18:00,880
Little guy.

3582
02:18:01,460 --> 02:18:02,860
I can't...

3583
02:18:02,860 --> 02:18:04,560
I can't have him there.

3584
02:18:07,180 --> 02:18:08,360
Alright, get up.

3585
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:14,000
Look at that face.

3586
02:18:14,640 --> 02:18:17,240
Marshall, thank you for the super chat.

3587
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:17,800
Thank you.

3588
02:18:18,020 --> 02:18:18,480
Thank you.

3589
02:18:20,560 --> 02:18:20,900
Yay.

3590
02:18:21,420 --> 02:18:22,080
Level 8.

3591
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:22,630
Level 8.

3592
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:25,680
Champion, thank you for the super chat.

3593
02:18:25,780 --> 02:18:26,360
Thank you, thank you.

3594
02:18:26,440 --> 02:18:28,420
Can I get dibs on the next unique one?

3595
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:29,460
What do I name...

3596
02:18:29,460 --> 02:18:32,500
If I catch the sprangler, you get to be sprangler too.

3597
02:18:38,300 --> 02:18:38,820
Aw...

3598
02:18:38,820 --> 02:18:39,860
You get saved.

3599
02:18:42,320 --> 02:18:44,200
One ticket for the isekai.

3600
02:18:44,340 --> 02:18:45,040
Gotcha, please.

3601
02:18:45,740 --> 02:18:47,140
Papa, thank you for the super chat.

3602
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:47,720
Thank you.

3603
02:18:47,940 --> 02:18:48,380
Thank you.

3604
02:18:49,380 --> 02:18:50,420
Alright, Papa.

3605
02:18:50,620 --> 02:18:50,960
If I...

3606
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:54,520
If I catch this beanie, you get to be beanie too.

3607
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:58,440
Oh.

3608
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:01,240
I might be able to catch this one.

3609
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:04,480
Very risky request.

3610
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:07,560
And then I shall banish you.

3611
02:19:12,780 --> 02:19:13,800
Alright.

3612
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:15,780
Not again.

3613
02:19:19,260 --> 02:19:20,280
Alright.

3614
02:19:20,720 --> 02:19:21,500
Smurf goon.

3615
02:19:22,460 --> 02:19:22,720
Yay.

3616
02:19:23,300 --> 02:19:23,800
Level 10.

3617
02:19:26,110 --> 02:19:27,720
But they said unique.

3618
02:19:28,120 --> 02:19:29,620
No, this one said isekai.

3619
02:19:29,720 --> 02:19:30,020
Gotcha.

3620
02:19:31,240 --> 02:19:31,960
Oh.

3621
02:19:33,300 --> 02:19:35,980
You get to be a smurf.

3622
02:19:36,600 --> 02:19:37,760
You get to join.

3623
02:19:37,960 --> 02:19:39,620
You get to join dick goon too.

3624
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:42,220
Oh my god.

3625
02:19:42,620 --> 02:19:45,560
Where did I put you both in the daycare center?

3626
02:19:45,980 --> 02:19:47,440
And make more beanies.

3627
02:19:47,880 --> 02:19:48,080
Oh.

3628
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:56,780
And then I can name more beanie children.

3629
02:19:57,460 --> 02:20:01,100
I can name more beanie children.

3630
02:20:01,100 --> 02:20:01,640
Guys.

3631
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:04,160
Sound.

3632
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:06,340
Why are they all nips?

3633
02:20:07,800 --> 02:20:08,760
I want it.

3634
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:10,020
I want a boo.

3635
02:20:12,860 --> 02:20:13,880
That's your gotcha.

3636
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:14,760
John.

3637
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:15,780
Thank you for the super chat.

3638
02:20:15,900 --> 02:20:16,140
Thank you.

3639
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:16,640
Thank you.

3640
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:19,160
Can you name the ugliest one after me, please?

3641
02:20:19,440 --> 02:20:19,640
John.

3642
02:20:19,780 --> 02:20:20,460
Thank you for the super chat.

3643
02:20:20,540 --> 02:20:20,760
Thank you.

3644
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:21,260
Thank you.

3645
02:20:22,260 --> 02:20:22,740
Guys.

3646
02:20:22,900 --> 02:20:24,060
I accidentally unplugged my controller.

3647
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:26,180
Because I was like twirling it.

3648
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:27,080
Oh no.

3649
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:27,820
Oh no.

3650
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:28,440
It's not red.

3651
02:20:28,580 --> 02:20:28,840
Guys.

3652
02:20:29,020 --> 02:20:30,060
It's not registering.

3653
02:20:30,340 --> 02:20:30,560
No.

3654
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:34,080
No.

3655
02:20:34,420 --> 02:20:35,260
My controller.

3656
02:20:35,260 --> 02:20:39,340
I was twirling my controller.

3657
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:41,480
Then the USB fell out.

3658
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:43,180
Controller.

3659
02:20:43,740 --> 02:20:44,200
Please.

3660
02:20:46,100 --> 02:20:48,340
My Xbox One controller.

3661
02:20:48,520 --> 02:20:49,620
I can't progress.

3662
02:20:51,580 --> 02:20:52,580
No.

3663
02:20:55,100 --> 02:20:56,100
Wait.

3664
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:56,840
Can I save?

3665
02:20:57,760 --> 02:20:58,780
Oh no.

3666
02:20:59,080 --> 02:20:59,520
Guys.

3667
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:00,580
I fucked up.

3668
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:04,140
Guys.

3669
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:05,500
I can't move it.

3670
02:21:07,820 --> 02:21:08,760
Oh no.

3671
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:10,200
Oh no.

3672
02:21:10,460 --> 02:21:10,580
Okay.

3673
02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:10,820
Wait.

3674
02:21:11,060 --> 02:21:11,500
Settings.

3675
02:21:12,480 --> 02:21:13,100
Keyboard.

3676
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:14,700
Oh, it's Z in it.

3677
02:21:14,820 --> 02:21:14,940
Okay.

3678
02:21:15,100 --> 02:21:15,240
Okay.

3679
02:21:16,480 --> 02:21:17,100
Alright.

3680
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:18,360
I know how to do the.

3681
02:21:18,360 --> 02:21:19,700
I know how to do the.

3682
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:20,060
I know how to do the.

3683
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:21,500
Do it on PC.

3684
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:23,380
Yay.

3685
02:21:24,140 --> 02:21:24,460
Okay.

3686
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:25,380
Guys.

3687
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:26,120
I can't move it.

3688
02:21:26,500 --> 02:21:27,320
Oh no.

3689
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:28,980
Oh no.

3690
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:30,920
How do I do the main menu?

3691
02:21:31,540 --> 02:21:32,160
Oh fuck.

3692
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:32,540
Okay.

3693
02:21:33,260 --> 02:21:33,600
Um.

3694
02:21:34,660 --> 02:21:34,980
Um.

3695
02:21:34,980 --> 02:21:36,580
I need to look at my controls on keyboard.

3696
02:21:37,060 --> 02:21:39,240
I don't know my keyboard controls.

3697
02:21:40,100 --> 02:21:40,580
Uh.

3698
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:41,440
Keyboard.

3699
02:21:42,120 --> 02:21:42,660
A.

3700
02:21:42,980 --> 02:21:43,580
S.

3701
02:21:43,980 --> 02:21:44,580
Backspace.

3702
02:21:44,940 --> 02:21:45,200
Return.

3703
02:21:45,540 --> 02:21:45,740
Okay.

3704
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:49,920
Backspace.

3705
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:51,180
Oh wait.

3706
02:21:51,300 --> 02:21:51,880
That's not it.

3707
02:21:52,860 --> 02:21:53,580
Where's return?

3708
02:21:53,740 --> 02:21:54,960
I don't have a return key.

3709
02:21:55,180 --> 02:21:56,540
I have to rebind that.

3710
02:21:57,920 --> 02:21:58,320
Settings.

3711
02:21:59,020 --> 02:21:59,500
Keyboard.

3712
02:22:00,620 --> 02:22:01,060
Um.

3713
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:02,200
I'll use...

3714
02:22:02,200 --> 02:22:02,520
Wait.

3715
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:02,860
I do.

3716
02:22:03,020 --> 02:22:03,120
Wait.

3717
02:22:03,320 --> 02:22:04,380
Return is my enter key.

3718
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:05,780
Oh my god.

3719
02:22:05,780 --> 02:22:06,620
I'm so stupid.

3720
02:22:07,440 --> 02:22:08,300
Return is my...

3721
02:22:10,980 --> 02:22:11,460
Okay.

3722
02:22:13,360 --> 02:22:13,640
Wait.

3723
02:22:13,740 --> 02:22:13,800
Why?

3724
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:15,520
Okay.

3725
02:22:15,580 --> 02:22:15,600
Wait.

3726
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:15,900
There we go.

3727
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:16,420
Yes.

3728
02:22:17,620 --> 02:22:18,260
Tokyo.

3729
02:22:18,960 --> 02:22:19,540
Mario.

3730
02:22:20,940 --> 02:22:21,500
Saving.

3731
02:22:21,780 --> 02:22:21,940
Yeah.

3732
02:22:23,180 --> 02:22:23,820
Alright.

3733
02:22:23,940 --> 02:22:24,980
I gotta restart my game.

3734
02:22:25,300 --> 02:22:27,360
I gotta restart it.

3735
02:22:28,300 --> 02:22:29,500
Give me a sec.

3736
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:30,900
Alright.

3737
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:31,540
GBA.

3738
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:35,180
I had to restart it because I accidentally fucked up.

3739
02:22:35,460 --> 02:22:39,760
I accidentally unplugged my controller because I was twirling it.

3740
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:41,060
Alright.

3741
02:22:45,330 --> 02:22:46,420
Give me a boo.

3742
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:50,260
Why are they all spranglers?

3743
02:22:50,780 --> 02:22:52,720
They're so ugly.

3744
02:22:56,710 --> 02:22:58,280
Get me out of here.

3745
02:23:01,400 --> 02:23:03,680
I don't want no sprangler.

3746
02:23:06,260 --> 02:23:07,860
Only spranglers and nips.

3747
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:09,060
I don't know.

3748
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:10,720
I didn't know we were playing by Genie wishes.

3749
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:12,760
There was Papa Smurfs.

3750
02:23:12,900 --> 02:23:13,140
Thank you.

3751
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:13,980
That's super...

3752
02:23:13,980 --> 02:23:14,640
Oh shit.

3753
02:23:14,860 --> 02:23:15,480
Oh I got bite.

3754
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:16,180
Okay.

3755
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:17,480
We don't need...

3756
02:23:17,480 --> 02:23:20,720
We don't need Flash, despite how much I would have loved...

3757
02:23:22,920 --> 02:23:24,500
With the face he was making.

3758
02:23:26,500 --> 02:23:27,960
It's just all Spranglers.

3759
02:23:28,340 --> 02:23:29,200
It's just all Spranglers.

3760
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:31,380
I literally saw one Boo and that's it.

3761
02:23:31,540 --> 02:23:32,780
This is so messed up.

3762
02:23:33,380 --> 02:23:35,720
How was I supposed to know I could just kill him?

3763
02:23:37,900 --> 02:23:39,420
Jen, thank you for the super chat.

3764
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:40,220
Thank you, thank you.

3765
02:23:40,280 --> 02:23:42,620
You should name the best looking one after John.

3766
02:23:42,980 --> 02:23:44,880
Also, we're not playing by Genie Wish's rule.

3767
02:23:44,980 --> 02:23:46,240
It's the monkey paw rule.

3768
02:23:46,240 --> 02:23:48,100
You want a name...

3769
02:23:48,100 --> 02:23:49,600
You want a name in the...

3770
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:50,760
In the doki party?

3771
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:54,200
You don't get to decide who your mod is.

3772
02:23:56,900 --> 02:23:58,300
Oh my god!

3773
02:23:58,380 --> 02:24:01,680
There was only one Boo that lives in her garden?

3774
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:06,520
I can't believe the Boo was so rare in Cali.

3775
02:24:06,540 --> 02:24:07,400
I'm so sad.

3776
02:24:09,640 --> 02:24:12,080
There was only one and you killed it.

3777
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:15,920
The monkey paw curl.

3778
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:19,660
How was I supposed to know he could just die?

3779
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:24,400
Alright.

3780
02:24:24,700 --> 02:24:25,320
There has to be.

3781
02:24:25,420 --> 02:24:27,300
I won't leave until I get that Boo.

3782
02:24:27,940 --> 02:24:28,720
God damn it.

3783
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:29,580
They're all beanies.

3784
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:31,780
It's either boonies, nips, and Spranglers.

3785
02:24:33,440 --> 02:24:35,600
Peach has a fucking pest control problem.

3786
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:41,200
At least I don't have to voice act some toads.

3787
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:44,640
We do not leave until we get a Boo.

3788
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:46,660
I don't know.

3789
02:24:46,760 --> 02:24:47,640
I thought like...

3790
02:24:47,640 --> 02:24:48,240
You know...

3791
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:49,000
I thought it'd work.

3792
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,040
Oh my god.

3793
02:24:50,440 --> 02:24:52,120
I used Spark though.

3794
02:24:52,860 --> 02:24:54,820
That's a weak move.

3795
02:24:59,020 --> 02:25:01,240
I thought, you know...

3796
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:03,480
Spark is like super weak.

3797
02:25:06,900 --> 02:25:07,620
All right.

3798
02:25:07,820 --> 02:25:08,260
It's fine.

3799
02:25:08,940 --> 02:25:09,660
It's fine.

3800
02:25:10,820 --> 02:25:12,540
There should be one more Boo.

3801
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:13,360
Oh my god.

3802
02:25:13,360 --> 02:25:14,600
It's just all beanies.

3803
02:25:14,920 --> 02:25:16,640
It's just all beanies.

3804
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:18,500
Please.

3805
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:22,100
One singular Boo in the army.

3806
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:24,300
Please.

3807
02:25:27,240 --> 02:25:28,880
Oscar, thank you for the super chat.

3808
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:29,300
Thank you.

3809
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:29,800
Thank you.

3810
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:30,220
Don't worry.

3811
02:25:30,300 --> 02:25:32,860
If I find another Magikarp, I'll name it after you.

3812
02:25:33,700 --> 02:25:34,340
Oh my god.

3813
02:25:34,480 --> 02:25:34,660
It's...

3814
02:25:34,660 --> 02:25:35,940
I've like given up fighting them.

3815
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:37,740
They're like not even worth my time.

3816
02:25:38,500 --> 02:25:39,420
I've actually...

3817
02:25:39,420 --> 02:25:41,580
I've given up fighting these fuckers.

3818
02:25:41,720 --> 02:25:43,340
It's not worth my time at all.

3819
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:44,560
It's...

3820
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:48,040
Also, what the fuck is the art button?

3821
02:25:48,280 --> 02:25:48,600
Oh!

3822
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:48,900
No!

3823
02:25:49,080 --> 02:25:49,620
I don't...

3824
02:25:51,660 --> 02:25:52,700
Oh, thank god.

3825
02:25:52,860 --> 02:25:53,040
Okay.

3826
02:25:53,080 --> 02:25:53,980
I didn't want another...

3827
02:25:53,980 --> 02:25:54,920
I didn't want another one.

3828
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:56,980
I didn't want another one.

3829
02:25:58,480 --> 02:25:59,100
All right.

3830
02:25:59,320 --> 02:26:00,220
It was that.

3831
02:26:00,540 --> 02:26:01,420
It was...

3832
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:02,380
That was the art button.

3833
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:03,980
Oh my god.

3834
02:26:03,980 --> 02:26:04,980
They're all just...

3835
02:26:04,980 --> 02:26:07,340
I didn't know Boo's were the rare one.

3836
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:12,280
Why is it so dirty that you immediately kill Milk Mint the moment you see her?

3837
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:16,420
I swear to god, if there are rare encounters on the other...

3838
02:26:16,420 --> 02:26:22,140
In like other places after I tried so hard getting a Boo in her stupid fucking garden, I swear to god.

3839
02:26:22,140 --> 02:26:29,100
If it's like the ghastly situation where I just have to go somewhere else and go to like a haunted area, I swear to fucking god.

3840
02:26:29,300 --> 02:26:29,800
I swear.

3841
02:26:30,280 --> 02:26:32,420
But this is where I found Boo last time.

3842
02:26:35,820 --> 02:26:36,760
Oh my god.

3843
02:26:37,180 --> 02:26:39,000
I can't believe it.

3844
02:26:39,400 --> 02:26:41,040
I was so excited.

3845
02:26:41,640 --> 02:26:42,040
Typical.

3846
02:26:42,180 --> 02:26:42,520
Thank you, man.

3847
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:43,040
Super chat.

3848
02:26:43,180 --> 02:26:43,420
Thank you.

3849
02:26:43,580 --> 02:26:43,940
Thank you.

3850
02:26:44,020 --> 02:26:45,540
There is a Boo mansion?

3851
02:26:47,500 --> 02:26:48,020
Goodbye.

3852
02:26:51,860 --> 02:26:53,380
That's all I need to know.

3853
02:26:54,400 --> 02:26:54,920
Goodbye.

3854
02:26:54,920 --> 02:27:00,540
I'll find a Boo in another time.

3855
02:27:03,480 --> 02:27:04,260
Goodbye.

3856
02:27:05,120 --> 02:27:06,580
I leave now.

3857
02:27:08,840 --> 02:27:11,040
Oh yeah, I wanted to...

3858
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:12,680
What do I want to do?

3859
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:14,520
I wanted to...

3860
02:27:17,340 --> 02:27:18,900
Oh yeah.

3861
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:19,840
Check the Yoshi.

3862
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:22,740
Which one is the...

3863
02:27:22,740 --> 02:27:22,960
Okay.

3864
02:27:23,580 --> 02:27:24,140
Nips.

3865
02:27:24,820 --> 02:27:25,540
Sprangler.

3866
02:27:26,760 --> 02:27:27,480
Peenie.

3867
02:27:28,960 --> 02:27:29,940
Baby Yoshi.

3868
02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:34,640
Where's the evolution thing?

3869
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:36,880
Evo.

3870
02:27:37,880 --> 02:27:39,900
Level one up to 50.

3871
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:41,780
Oh, yellow shell.

3872
02:27:41,960 --> 02:27:43,300
Wait, but what's the 50?

3873
02:27:43,480 --> 02:27:46,020
Oh, I guess 50 is the regular green Yoshi.

3874
02:27:46,160 --> 02:27:47,360
I want a yellow Yoshi.

3875
02:27:47,900 --> 02:27:49,140
Where is yellow Yoshi?

3876
02:27:53,400 --> 02:27:55,980
Is yellow Yoshi electric type?

3877
02:28:01,830 --> 02:28:03,090
Do you guys hear that?

3878
02:28:13,430 --> 02:28:14,870
Wait, 50 is Big Boy?

3879
02:28:15,290 --> 02:28:16,690
Guys, we're doing...

3880
02:28:16,690 --> 02:28:18,970
Guys, we're leveling with this one up to 50.

3881
02:28:19,490 --> 02:28:21,250
Guys, wait, what type is Big Boy?

3882
02:28:21,890 --> 02:28:22,330
What type...

3883
02:28:24,650 --> 02:28:25,970
Guys, okay.

3884
02:28:26,250 --> 02:28:28,890
I am okay to get spoiled for Big Boy.

3885
02:28:29,290 --> 02:28:29,810
I...

3886
02:28:32,150 --> 02:28:34,050
Big Boy is my favorite Yoshi.

3887
02:28:34,850 --> 02:28:36,550
It is my favorite Yoshi.

3888
02:28:36,810 --> 02:28:37,830
We need to be big.

3889
02:28:40,770 --> 02:28:41,390
Alright.

3890
02:28:41,770 --> 02:28:43,790
Yoshi's gonna be level 50.

3891
02:28:44,030 --> 02:28:44,850
My Big Boy.

3892
02:28:47,230 --> 02:28:49,010
Then you're in the right place.

3893
02:28:50,610 --> 02:28:51,900
Wait, but how come...

3894
02:28:52,950 --> 02:28:54,070
Where do I go?

3895
02:28:55,410 --> 02:28:56,190
Wait, what?

3896
02:28:57,830 --> 02:28:58,990
Where else do I go?

3897
02:29:09,750 --> 02:29:10,530
Orange pipe?

3898
02:29:11,290 --> 02:29:12,690
No one let me earlier.

3899
02:29:15,130 --> 02:29:16,750
Wait, oh, is this it?

3900
02:29:16,750 --> 02:29:19,330
Oh, I didn't realize it was next to me.

3901
02:29:19,430 --> 02:29:20,930
I thought this was like...

3902
02:29:20,930 --> 02:29:21,190
Hey, bro.

3903
02:29:21,970 --> 02:29:22,670
Oh, I finally...

3904
02:29:22,670 --> 02:29:24,210
The one that pipe I didn't look at.

3905
02:29:24,410 --> 02:29:25,930
I finally got up to you.

3906
02:29:26,550 --> 02:29:26,950
Mario.

3907
02:29:27,230 --> 02:29:28,710
Let's have a friendly battle.

3908
02:29:28,770 --> 02:29:29,990
But we're hitting the world too.

3909
02:29:30,430 --> 02:29:33,090
I want to show you how strong my captures I've been getting.

3910
02:29:37,470 --> 02:29:38,750
Oh, my God.

3911
02:29:38,870 --> 02:29:39,750
He has three months.

3912
02:29:40,090 --> 02:29:40,590
He has Chuck.

3913
02:29:41,470 --> 02:29:42,390
That's all right.

3914
02:29:42,670 --> 02:29:43,750
I have dad.

3915
02:29:45,010 --> 02:29:46,330
Hi, thank you for the super chat.

3916
02:29:46,430 --> 02:29:46,670
Thank you.

3917
02:29:46,770 --> 02:29:47,170
Thank you.

3918
02:29:47,250 --> 02:29:48,510
I'm gonna chuck you out.

3919
02:29:48,670 --> 02:29:49,150
You're gonna...

3920
02:29:49,150 --> 02:29:50,410
Your name is Chuck.

3921
02:29:50,990 --> 02:29:52,370
Watch me chuck you.

3922
02:29:53,370 --> 02:29:53,750
Whoa!

3923
02:29:55,970 --> 02:29:57,090
I'm firefighting.

3924
02:30:00,950 --> 02:30:01,510
Yeah.

3925
02:30:05,050 --> 02:30:06,170
Get Chucked.

3926
02:30:08,870 --> 02:30:09,570
All right.

3927
02:30:09,690 --> 02:30:10,870
40 more levels to go.

3928
02:30:12,270 --> 02:30:13,070
Don't worry.

3929
02:30:13,230 --> 02:30:14,270
I still have dad.

3930
02:30:14,650 --> 02:30:15,970
Oh, Bitey.

3931
02:30:16,250 --> 02:30:17,690
Oh, you're gonna...

3932
02:30:17,690 --> 02:30:18,130
Yeah?

3933
02:30:18,630 --> 02:30:20,530
I learned my mistakes.

3934
02:30:21,490 --> 02:30:22,430
Get out.

3935
02:30:23,870 --> 02:30:24,670
Oh, shit.

3936
02:30:24,850 --> 02:30:24,970
Okay.

3937
02:30:25,030 --> 02:30:25,710
You're still alive.

3938
02:30:27,390 --> 02:30:28,330
Oh, my God.

3939
02:30:28,450 --> 02:30:29,230
What will Bitey do?

3940
02:30:29,350 --> 02:30:30,590
Is he gonna bite me?

3941
02:30:33,090 --> 02:30:33,310
Oh, wait.

3942
02:30:33,390 --> 02:30:33,630
He did.

3943
02:30:33,910 --> 02:30:35,210
But it's not very effective.

3944
02:30:35,450 --> 02:30:36,070
That's fucking right.

3945
02:30:36,170 --> 02:30:36,990
Get Flame Charge.

3946
02:30:39,870 --> 02:30:40,590
That's right.

3947
02:30:40,750 --> 02:30:42,690
Get out of here, Bitey.

3948
02:30:42,850 --> 02:30:43,990
I learned my lesson.

3949
02:30:45,890 --> 02:30:48,650
I learned my lesson from our first fight, guys.

3950
02:30:49,050 --> 02:30:50,010
Never again.

3951
02:30:50,390 --> 02:30:52,010
Never again will I...

3952
02:30:52,010 --> 02:30:54,050
Will I self-destruct.

3953
02:30:55,890 --> 02:30:56,730
Flame on.

3954
02:30:57,490 --> 02:30:58,230
Oh, my God.

3955
02:30:58,310 --> 02:30:59,290
We're all getting stronger.

3956
02:31:01,310 --> 02:31:03,850
Look at all these other mods that I'm never gonna use.

3957
02:31:04,130 --> 02:31:04,710
Who's private?

3958
02:31:05,010 --> 02:31:05,210
All right.

3959
02:31:05,750 --> 02:31:06,350
Is it Koopa?

3960
02:31:06,750 --> 02:31:08,050
Oh, I fucking knew it.

3961
02:31:08,550 --> 02:31:09,790
So generic, Luigi.

3962
02:31:10,570 --> 02:31:13,210
I don't know if I can win, but I'm gonna give it my all.

3963
02:31:13,430 --> 02:31:15,890
How the fuck did you beat Princess Peach with this team?

3964
02:31:17,110 --> 02:31:17,630
That's it.

3965
02:31:17,730 --> 02:31:19,310
I bet you she gave you a pity start.

3966
02:31:19,390 --> 02:31:22,730
There's no way you beat Princess Peach with that team.

3967
02:31:23,770 --> 02:31:25,170
There's no fucking way.

3968
02:31:25,830 --> 02:31:26,270
Okay.

3969
02:31:26,390 --> 02:31:27,050
Vital throw.

3970
02:31:29,150 --> 02:31:31,070
Spirit with the power of friendship.

3971
02:31:31,870 --> 02:31:32,470
All right.

3972
02:31:32,610 --> 02:31:34,410
Get out of here, private!

3973
02:31:38,010 --> 02:31:38,490
Yay!

3974
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:46,200
All right.

3975
02:31:46,520 --> 02:31:47,480
Oh, I got Flame Wheel.

3976
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:48,240
Wait, what's that?

3977
02:31:48,340 --> 02:31:49,100
What does that look like?

3978
02:31:50,400 --> 02:31:52,300
Fire, charge, and may inflict burn.

3979
02:31:52,780 --> 02:31:54,920
Oh, my God.

3980
02:31:55,080 --> 02:31:56,300
All my moves are so good.

3981
02:31:57,980 --> 02:32:00,320
Guys, we can't get rid of self-destruct.

3982
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:04,780
That should be, like, our boat, like, our actual, like, Hail Mary.

3983
02:32:06,180 --> 02:32:07,680
Oh, I don't know.

3984
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:09,940
Really?

3985
02:32:10,320 --> 02:32:11,480
Do I really need...

3986
02:32:11,480 --> 02:32:12,280
Okay, you're right.

3987
02:32:12,580 --> 02:32:12,600
Me.

3988
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:17,480
But it's my signature move.

3989
02:32:17,800 --> 02:32:18,440
Fine.

3990
02:32:18,980 --> 02:32:20,900
I'll get rid of self-destruct.

3991
02:32:22,280 --> 02:32:24,780
I almost want to fight with it.

3992
02:32:25,060 --> 02:32:25,140
Six.

3993
02:32:25,520 --> 02:32:27,180
Welcome to Tomato Farm.

3994
02:32:27,900 --> 02:32:28,620
Welcome, welcome.

3995
02:32:29,860 --> 02:32:32,180
But it's so much fun, though.

3996
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:35,340
It's the core of their identity.

3997
02:32:35,940 --> 02:32:36,780
His name...

3998
02:32:36,780 --> 02:32:38,360
He's literally a ba-bomb.

3999
02:32:38,480 --> 02:32:41,240
What kind of ba-bomb doesn't know self-destruct?

4000
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:48,460
I'm not surprised.

4001
02:32:48,460 --> 02:32:50,140
I didn't win this time, bro.

4002
02:32:50,720 --> 02:32:52,880
You're always super good at party games.

4003
02:32:53,060 --> 02:32:56,000
That just means I need to find some more friends to train up.

4004
02:32:56,280 --> 02:32:57,560
I'll catch you later.

4005
02:32:58,520 --> 02:33:00,160
I can't believe it.

4006
02:33:00,340 --> 02:33:01,780
He lost his identity.

4007
02:33:02,340 --> 02:33:04,680
What kind of ba-bomb doesn't know self-destruct?

4008
02:33:04,680 --> 02:33:06,080
What would his mom think?

4009
02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:09,040
Wow!

4010
02:33:09,400 --> 02:33:10,260
We're so high up.

4011
02:33:10,500 --> 02:33:14,120
I may be careful not fall off so I don't cause any troubles for the lockatoos.

4012
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:17,100
Oh, we're up in the sky.

4013
02:33:17,380 --> 02:33:20,040
Oh, they're gonna have flying type here, right?

4014
02:33:20,460 --> 02:33:21,080
I want to see.

4015
02:33:21,520 --> 02:33:23,560
I want to see the flying type.

4016
02:33:24,180 --> 02:33:25,380
Oh my god.

4017
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:26,500
What are these...

4018
02:33:27,060 --> 02:33:28,700
What are these lips?

4019
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:32,820
Alright, how strong am I?

4020
02:33:36,400 --> 02:33:37,260
Oh, nice.

4021
02:33:37,380 --> 02:33:37,960
Just in time.

4022
02:33:39,200 --> 02:33:39,660
Boom.

4023
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:41,200
Alright.

4024
02:33:41,700 --> 02:33:42,120
Good.

4025
02:33:42,700 --> 02:33:43,640
I need to stop doing that.

4026
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:44,760
I can just press R.

4027
02:33:47,580 --> 02:33:49,140
He's here to blow.

4028
02:33:50,460 --> 02:33:52,060
Because he's a clown, guys.

4029
02:33:53,020 --> 02:33:54,480
He's blowing the wind.

4030
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:56,280
He's a clown.

4031
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:02,860
Who was the one that was like, you should name the best looking one after...

4032
02:34:02,860 --> 02:34:03,280
Wait.

4033
02:34:03,940 --> 02:34:05,300
Wait, what was it?

4034
02:34:05,840 --> 02:34:07,080
Someone was like...

4035
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:08,140
Oh, the ugliest one?

4036
02:34:08,920 --> 02:34:09,780
But then...

4037
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:10,840
But he's not ugly.

4038
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:11,400
He's beautiful.

4039
02:34:11,560 --> 02:34:14,460
A breezy fellow that hides itself in the clouds.

4040
02:34:14,660 --> 02:34:16,880
It attacks by creating freezing fogs.

4041
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:18,040
But that can easily...

4042
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:19,000
Oh, he's a fairy?

4043
02:34:21,140 --> 02:34:21,780
Alright.

4044
02:34:22,740 --> 02:34:24,020
John Goon.

4045
02:34:24,520 --> 02:34:25,160
Alright.

4046
02:34:25,880 --> 02:34:26,060
Alright.

4047
02:34:28,200 --> 02:34:29,920
You know what your job is.

4048
02:34:34,400 --> 02:34:35,100
Oh my god.

4049
02:34:35,260 --> 02:34:36,640
And it's female, too.

4050
02:34:40,880 --> 02:34:42,540
I don't think I want...

4051
02:34:42,540 --> 02:34:43,800
I don't think...

4052
02:34:43,800 --> 02:34:44,940
Oh, it's a pity bun!

4053
02:34:45,140 --> 02:34:47,620
I don't think I want John Goon in my party.

4054
02:34:49,880 --> 02:34:50,620
Don't worry.

4055
02:34:51,140 --> 02:34:51,660
All the...

4056
02:34:51,660 --> 02:34:55,460
All the Mario mons in Exile are gonna have a good time.

4057
02:34:56,880 --> 02:34:58,060
Baby doll eyes.

4058
02:35:01,400 --> 02:35:02,360
Oh, no.

4059
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:10,000
Alright.

4060
02:35:10,340 --> 02:35:10,680
Oh, nice.

4061
02:35:10,860 --> 02:35:11,220
I don't know.

4062
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:11,760
Not nice.

4063
02:35:11,880 --> 02:35:12,600
I accidentally killed him.

4064
02:35:12,780 --> 02:35:14,460
I might have to use like my other mons.

4065
02:35:14,460 --> 02:35:15,880
Oh, it's a spiny!

4066
02:35:18,170 --> 02:35:19,750
Hey, what type is spiny?

4067
02:35:21,190 --> 02:35:22,450
Okay, I can't kill...

4068
02:35:22,450 --> 02:35:22,890
Wait, okay.

4069
02:35:22,970 --> 02:35:24,230
I don't think this can kill spiny.

4070
02:35:24,710 --> 02:35:25,530
There's no way.

4071
02:35:26,090 --> 02:35:27,430
I want a spiny!

4072
02:35:28,050 --> 02:35:28,570
Nice.

4073
02:35:29,250 --> 02:35:30,570
If it's normal...

4074
02:35:30,570 --> 02:35:32,210
I might not be able...

4075
02:35:32,210 --> 02:35:32,870
Oh, it's seal?

4076
02:35:34,390 --> 02:35:35,270
Okay, nice.

4077
02:35:37,270 --> 02:35:39,630
I want spiny in my party.

4078
02:35:40,390 --> 02:35:41,670
I love spiny.

4079
02:35:45,670 --> 02:35:46,750
It's solid snake.

4080
02:35:46,870 --> 02:35:47,790
Thank you for the super chat.

4081
02:35:47,930 --> 02:35:48,110
Thank you.

4082
02:35:48,270 --> 02:35:48,650
Thank you.

4083
02:35:48,950 --> 02:35:51,930
In before Doki makes another smasher pass with balance.

4084
02:35:52,110 --> 02:35:52,790
Nuffy from Mario.

4085
02:35:53,130 --> 02:35:54,150
Thank you for the super chat.

4086
02:35:54,270 --> 02:35:54,490
Thank you.

4087
02:35:54,630 --> 02:35:55,270
Thank you.

4088
02:35:56,310 --> 02:35:57,330
God, thank you for...

4089
02:35:57,330 --> 02:35:57,610
No!

4090
02:35:57,950 --> 02:35:59,250
Get in my ball!

4091
02:36:00,150 --> 02:36:01,210
Or my cat!

4092
02:36:02,790 --> 02:36:04,530
Oh, but he's weak as fuck.

4093
02:36:04,790 --> 02:36:05,010
Okay.

4094
02:36:05,330 --> 02:36:06,610
I won't put you...

4095
02:36:06,610 --> 02:36:06,830
Okay.

4096
02:36:07,010 --> 02:36:10,090
I might not put spiny in my party.

4097
02:36:10,090 --> 02:36:12,290
Because he seems like...

4098
02:36:12,290 --> 02:36:13,290
He's weak as hell.

4099
02:36:13,890 --> 02:36:14,530
So...

4100
02:36:14,530 --> 02:36:16,710
I don't think I need a seal type though.

4101
02:36:17,050 --> 02:36:17,690
I don't know.

4102
02:36:18,750 --> 02:36:19,990
I feel like...

4103
02:36:19,990 --> 02:36:20,550
Okay.

4104
02:36:21,010 --> 02:36:21,650
Honestly...

4105
02:36:21,650 --> 02:36:23,090
I'll take him over.

4106
02:36:23,650 --> 02:36:24,350
Oh, wait.

4107
02:36:24,690 --> 02:36:25,010
Spawn.

4108
02:36:25,150 --> 02:36:25,490
What did I get?

4109
02:36:25,590 --> 02:36:25,810
Bite?

4110
02:36:26,590 --> 02:36:27,230
Clamp.

4111
02:36:28,290 --> 02:36:29,530
I'll get rid of tackle.

4112
02:36:32,190 --> 02:36:33,970
He's level 11.

4113
02:36:34,330 --> 02:36:35,910
Give him a chance!

4114
02:36:39,190 --> 02:36:40,010
All right.

4115
02:36:40,430 --> 02:36:41,210
All right.

4116
02:36:41,590 --> 02:36:43,870
I'll see if he has better moves later.

4117
02:36:44,850 --> 02:36:47,250
A compact turtle with a spike shell.

4118
02:36:47,430 --> 02:36:49,510
Its slow speed makes it easy to manage.

4119
02:36:49,650 --> 02:36:52,430
Unless your preferred method attack is a stomp to the head.

4120
02:36:53,170 --> 02:36:53,650
All right.

4121
02:36:54,270 --> 02:36:55,050
What should...

4122
02:36:55,050 --> 02:36:57,050
Who would be spying me?

4123
02:36:57,330 --> 02:36:57,630
Hmm.

4124
02:36:58,090 --> 02:36:59,710
This is gonna be in my party.

4125
02:36:59,710 --> 02:37:01,090
So, like...

4126
02:37:01,090 --> 02:37:02,130
I'm test run.

4127
02:37:02,250 --> 02:37:04,110
Actually, he's gonna be test run.

4128
02:37:04,310 --> 02:37:04,870
So, like...

4129
02:37:04,870 --> 02:37:07,470
Might not necessarily be forever in my party.

4130
02:37:07,770 --> 02:37:09,290
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick though.

4131
02:37:09,330 --> 02:37:10,050
Before I decide.

4132
02:37:10,170 --> 02:37:10,670
I'll be right back.

4133
02:38:10,450 --> 02:38:11,290
I'm back.

4134
02:38:11,570 --> 02:38:13,870
Blow my nose before I start the game.

4135
02:38:14,170 --> 02:38:15,910
Before I go back to the game.

4136
02:38:16,570 --> 02:38:16,730
Oh.

4137
02:38:17,150 --> 02:38:17,590
There you go.

4138
02:38:17,990 --> 02:38:18,590
All right.

4139
02:38:18,750 --> 02:38:20,430
Who gets to be the lucky goon?

4140
02:38:20,530 --> 02:38:22,390
The lucky goon to be Spawny.

4141
02:38:22,390 --> 02:38:26,250
Spawny, Alan, Byte, Pottleball, Krish, and Foa.

4142
02:38:26,270 --> 02:38:27,090
Thank you for the super chat.

4143
02:38:27,210 --> 02:38:27,450
Thank you.

4144
02:38:27,550 --> 02:38:28,170
Thank you.

4145
02:38:28,830 --> 02:38:29,130
Oh.

4146
02:38:29,590 --> 02:38:31,510
Let me look at the choices.

4147
02:38:32,050 --> 02:38:32,430
All right.

4148
02:38:32,990 --> 02:38:34,670
Let us get...

4149
02:38:34,670 --> 02:38:35,010
Hmm.

4150
02:38:36,550 --> 02:38:37,270
Me.

4151
02:38:38,090 --> 02:38:39,050
All right.

4152
02:38:39,530 --> 02:38:40,390
Gotcha time.

4153
02:38:40,810 --> 02:38:41,890
Gotcha time.

4154
02:38:42,810 --> 02:38:45,230
I'll give it to...

4155
02:38:48,630 --> 02:38:49,350
Hmm.

4156
02:38:52,750 --> 02:38:53,510
All right.

4157
02:38:53,710 --> 02:38:54,170
Let's see.

4158
02:38:56,550 --> 02:38:59,110
One roll on the gacha, please.

4159
02:38:59,450 --> 02:38:59,830
All right.

4160
02:39:00,430 --> 02:39:00,990
Helfito.

4161
02:39:01,530 --> 02:39:02,650
Thank you for the super chat.

4162
02:39:02,790 --> 02:39:03,050
Thank you.

4163
02:39:03,190 --> 02:39:03,670
Thank you.

4164
02:39:03,870 --> 02:39:04,090
All right.

4165
02:39:04,190 --> 02:39:06,670
You get to be my trial run.

4166
02:39:07,330 --> 02:39:08,450
For Spawny.

4167
02:39:13,350 --> 02:39:14,230
Where's F?

4168
02:39:15,190 --> 02:39:15,490
Okay.

4169
02:39:15,830 --> 02:39:15,950
Hey.

4170
02:39:19,430 --> 02:39:19,950
Hef...

4171
02:39:21,290 --> 02:39:21,810
Lee...

4172
02:39:22,750 --> 02:39:24,210
Hef-lee-goon.

4173
02:39:24,470 --> 02:39:25,750
Because I don't have enough space.

4174
02:39:27,130 --> 02:39:28,570
Hef-lee-goon.

4175
02:39:30,110 --> 02:39:32,050
Would be fucked up if I spelled your name wrong.

4176
02:39:33,410 --> 02:39:34,890
It was placed in...

4177
02:39:34,890 --> 02:39:35,490
Don't worry.

4178
02:39:35,750 --> 02:39:36,910
I'll get you out.

4179
02:39:38,110 --> 02:39:39,690
How come I can't use the...

4180
02:39:39,690 --> 02:39:40,010
Don't worry.

4181
02:39:40,110 --> 02:39:42,610
I'll get you out of the Excel box.

4182
02:39:43,070 --> 02:39:43,950
Key items.

4183
02:39:44,850 --> 02:39:45,810
How come it...

4184
02:39:45,810 --> 02:39:46,730
The art doesn't work.

4185
02:39:47,410 --> 02:39:47,930
Oh.

4186
02:39:48,030 --> 02:39:49,450
In the party menu.

4187
02:39:49,850 --> 02:39:49,990
Oh.

4188
02:39:50,850 --> 02:39:51,810
I'll do it here.

4189
02:39:52,830 --> 02:39:54,530
I hope John-goon...

4190
02:39:54,530 --> 02:39:56,810
I hope everybody's having fun with John-goon.

4191
02:39:57,050 --> 02:39:57,230
I...

4192
02:40:02,730 --> 02:40:04,770
I hope y'all having fun there.

4193
02:40:05,470 --> 02:40:05,710
All right.

4194
02:40:05,810 --> 02:40:06,310
Who are you...

4195
02:40:06,310 --> 02:40:06,670
All right.

4196
02:40:06,830 --> 02:40:07,630
Goodbye, tips.

4197
02:40:08,070 --> 02:40:09,510
You've had your good run.

4198
02:40:09,810 --> 02:40:11,670
But I don't want to rock Pokemon.

4199
02:40:11,670 --> 02:40:12,030
Come on.

4200
02:40:14,330 --> 02:40:15,170
We are.

4201
02:40:18,530 --> 02:40:19,250
All right.

4202
02:40:19,410 --> 02:40:19,990
Let's see.

4203
02:40:22,790 --> 02:40:23,530
I'm done.

4204
02:40:24,730 --> 02:40:25,450
All right.

4205
02:40:25,650 --> 02:40:26,010
Let's see.

4206
02:40:26,110 --> 02:40:26,730
What is my...

4207
02:40:26,730 --> 02:40:26,950
Oh yeah.

4208
02:40:27,010 --> 02:40:27,610
What is the type?

4209
02:40:27,810 --> 02:40:28,710
I didn't look at the type.

4210
02:40:29,110 --> 02:40:29,350
Steel.

4211
02:40:29,650 --> 02:40:29,790
Okay.

4212
02:40:30,050 --> 02:40:30,210
Steel.

4213
02:40:31,770 --> 02:40:32,070
Wait.

4214
02:40:32,170 --> 02:40:32,870
Is he...

4215
02:40:32,870 --> 02:40:33,750
Spying?

4216
02:40:34,310 --> 02:40:34,870
All right.

4217
02:40:35,330 --> 02:40:36,230
All right, guys.

4218
02:40:37,090 --> 02:40:39,170
Let's see what other mons are in here.

4219
02:40:39,730 --> 02:40:41,330
What other mons are up in the sky?

4220
02:40:42,430 --> 02:40:43,550
Oh, it's just foo.

4221
02:40:44,330 --> 02:40:44,790
Another one.

4222
02:40:46,150 --> 02:40:47,350
Guys, do you think...

4223
02:40:47,350 --> 02:40:48,870
Do you think John needs more help?

4224
02:40:49,090 --> 02:40:49,590
Should I...

4225
02:40:52,150 --> 02:40:52,910
Should I...

4226
02:40:52,910 --> 02:40:54,950
Should I have another helper over here?

4227
02:40:57,430 --> 02:40:58,530
Doki, please.

4228
02:41:04,010 --> 02:41:04,490
All right.

4229
02:41:04,490 --> 02:41:05,270
I just want to know...

4230
02:41:05,270 --> 02:41:06,510
I just want to see if there's any more.

4231
02:41:06,970 --> 02:41:07,490
Oh yeah.

4232
02:41:07,530 --> 02:41:08,490
I wanted to get Biddy Bud.

4233
02:41:09,830 --> 02:41:10,810
That's what I wanted to get.

4234
02:41:10,810 --> 02:41:11,130
Okay.

4235
02:41:11,170 --> 02:41:13,230
There's no way I'll fucking kill him right away.

4236
02:41:13,330 --> 02:41:14,050
Oh, it failed?

4237
02:41:14,270 --> 02:41:14,370
Oh.

4238
02:41:15,050 --> 02:41:16,550
There's no way I one-shot this guy.

4239
02:41:17,270 --> 02:41:17,430
Yeah.

4240
02:41:17,490 --> 02:41:17,950
There we go.

4241
02:41:18,990 --> 02:41:19,330
Nice.

4242
02:41:23,540 --> 02:41:24,260
Biddy Bud.

4243
02:41:24,660 --> 02:41:25,520
Get in my cap.

4244
02:41:26,120 --> 02:41:26,400
Yeah.

4245
02:41:28,520 --> 02:41:29,120
All right.

4246
02:41:29,480 --> 02:41:30,280
Next goon.

4247
02:41:32,080 --> 02:41:32,980
All right, Alan.

4248
02:41:33,300 --> 02:41:34,780
You get to be a Biddy Bud.

4249
02:41:35,400 --> 02:41:36,180
Don't worry.

4250
02:41:36,860 --> 02:41:37,680
You get to...

4251
02:41:37,680 --> 02:41:37,940
Don't worry.

4252
02:41:38,060 --> 02:41:38,620
John's there.

4253
02:41:42,310 --> 02:41:44,010
A quaint round creature.

4254
02:41:44,290 --> 02:41:45,950
It has a strong sense of routine.

4255
02:41:46,290 --> 02:41:50,530
Its distinct bumbling sounds inspire folk music and help locals fall asleep.

4256
02:41:51,590 --> 02:41:51,870
All right.

4257
02:41:52,990 --> 02:41:53,650
Alan goon.

4258
02:41:57,450 --> 02:41:58,130
Alan...

4259
02:41:59,410 --> 02:41:59,810
Goon.

4260
02:42:02,710 --> 02:42:03,410
There we go.

4261
02:42:05,430 --> 02:42:05,830
Exiled.

4262
02:42:08,250 --> 02:42:08,690
All right.

4263
02:42:08,810 --> 02:42:09,130
That's all.

4264
02:42:09,350 --> 02:42:11,050
The doctor here is a little eccentric.

4265
02:42:11,370 --> 02:42:12,150
Don't get me wrong.

4266
02:42:12,350 --> 02:42:13,770
He'll kill you with any issues.

4267
02:42:14,010 --> 02:42:14,410
Just...

4268
02:42:14,410 --> 02:42:15,610
Don't let him creep you out.

4269
02:42:15,690 --> 02:42:15,770
Wait.

4270
02:42:15,830 --> 02:42:16,510
What's wrong with him?

4271
02:42:17,810 --> 02:42:20,490
All patients are subjected to experimental treatment.

4272
02:42:20,730 --> 02:42:22,090
I love experimental treatment.

4273
02:42:23,290 --> 02:42:23,850
Oh.

4274
02:42:24,230 --> 02:42:25,310
It's a shy guy.

4275
02:42:26,390 --> 02:42:27,210
A visitor.

4276
02:42:27,470 --> 02:42:27,830
Please.

4277
02:42:27,970 --> 02:42:28,750
Go see the doctor.

4278
02:42:29,030 --> 02:42:30,290
He'll help you out however he can.

4279
02:42:30,470 --> 02:42:31,070
Trust me.

4280
02:42:32,170 --> 02:42:32,950
What's this?

4281
02:42:33,110 --> 02:42:34,130
You have your party here?

4282
02:42:34,450 --> 02:42:34,790
Great.

4283
02:42:35,310 --> 02:42:36,710
This won't hurt a bit.

4284
02:42:37,270 --> 02:42:37,830
Probably.

4285
02:42:38,690 --> 02:42:39,110
Okay.

4286
02:42:39,190 --> 02:42:39,550
Never mind.

4287
02:42:39,670 --> 02:42:40,350
I take it back.

4288
02:42:44,590 --> 02:42:47,690
If it's a shy guy, I don't really want him near me.

4289
02:42:52,530 --> 02:42:52,950
What?

4290
02:42:55,030 --> 02:42:55,450
Oh!

4291
02:43:01,220 --> 02:43:01,640
Okay.

4292
02:43:01,920 --> 02:43:04,460
You definitely don't want to be in the line of fire when that happens.

4293
02:43:04,600 --> 02:43:05,020
Trust me.

4294
02:43:05,140 --> 02:43:05,320
Oh, wait.

4295
02:43:05,380 --> 02:43:08,000
You guys were like saying I should get in the line of fire.

4296
02:43:08,280 --> 02:43:08,480
Hmm.

4297
02:43:09,100 --> 02:43:09,440
Wait.

4298
02:43:09,820 --> 02:43:11,440
There's a latika.

4299
02:43:12,080 --> 02:43:14,180
Do you know what this switch here does?

4300
02:43:14,400 --> 02:43:14,940
Um.

4301
02:43:15,220 --> 02:43:16,900
You can tell me before you fight me.

4302
02:43:18,660 --> 02:43:19,600
Interviewed Nimbus.

4303
02:43:19,760 --> 02:43:20,460
We like to battle.

4304
02:43:21,300 --> 02:43:22,260
Oh, it's another.

4305
02:43:22,420 --> 02:43:23,360
Oh, you have one too?

4306
02:43:23,660 --> 02:43:24,620
In your own party?

4307
02:43:28,360 --> 02:43:29,400
Or latikusar.

4308
02:43:30,040 --> 02:43:31,100
Oh, you have...

4309
02:43:31,100 --> 02:43:32,900
It's in your own...

4310
02:43:32,900 --> 02:43:33,720
You brought...

4311
02:43:33,720 --> 02:43:34,780
Travel size.

4312
02:43:40,470 --> 02:43:42,030
Everyone has a foo.

4313
02:43:42,410 --> 02:43:43,630
What do you mean?

4314
02:43:45,870 --> 02:43:46,850
All right.

4315
02:43:46,850 --> 02:43:47,610
Let's bring...

4316
02:43:47,610 --> 02:43:47,890
Actually, no.

4317
02:43:48,030 --> 02:43:49,190
Let's not bring anybody out.

4318
02:43:50,710 --> 02:43:51,910
Toki, please.

4319
02:43:53,210 --> 02:43:54,890
You have two.

4320
02:43:56,970 --> 02:43:59,210
What do you have two?

4321
02:43:59,790 --> 02:44:00,230
Sir?

4322
02:44:00,890 --> 02:44:02,710
Why do you have two?

4323
02:44:07,770 --> 02:44:08,730
He gets...

4324
02:44:08,730 --> 02:44:10,570
Look, it's hard work out there.

4325
02:44:10,990 --> 02:44:11,370
Whoa!

4326
02:44:13,550 --> 02:44:15,310
I don't think that doctor...

4327
02:44:15,310 --> 02:44:16,030
Yeah, I don't think so.

4328
02:44:16,270 --> 02:44:18,310
I don't think it was a super...

4329
02:44:18,310 --> 02:44:18,610
Oh, wait.

4330
02:44:18,650 --> 02:44:19,050
It's red.

4331
02:44:19,350 --> 02:44:20,730
Maybe there's red mons.

4332
02:44:22,650 --> 02:44:23,310
Oh, no.

4333
02:44:23,470 --> 02:44:25,030
It's just the same guy.

4334
02:44:25,990 --> 02:44:26,450
God.

4335
02:44:26,790 --> 02:44:28,270
Guys, I think I get tired.

4336
02:44:28,710 --> 02:44:28,770
Okay.

4337
02:44:33,430 --> 02:44:36,350
No, it should be three foos and three cheep cheeps.

4338
02:44:40,540 --> 02:44:42,140
Yeah, I'll be the same, guys.

4339
02:44:42,380 --> 02:44:43,380
You gotta have variety.

4340
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:45,540
The ideal cop.

4341
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:47,080
Oh, it is red.

4342
02:44:47,200 --> 02:44:48,040
Wait, you're right.

4343
02:44:48,680 --> 02:44:49,920
It is red.

4344
02:44:51,380 --> 02:44:53,400
Red grass reads red mons.

4345
02:44:56,040 --> 02:44:56,360
All right.

4346
02:44:59,900 --> 02:45:01,840
I want to see if there's any other different ones.

4347
02:45:02,080 --> 02:45:02,320
Oh, no.

4348
02:45:02,420 --> 02:45:03,340
They're all just bitty buds.

4349
02:45:03,540 --> 02:45:03,660
All right.

4350
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:04,360
Get out of here.

4351
02:45:05,180 --> 02:45:06,820
Get out of here, bitty bud.

4352
02:45:08,380 --> 02:45:09,580
The lips party.

4353
02:45:10,200 --> 02:45:12,460
What if I make my entire party?

4354
02:45:12,820 --> 02:45:13,600
The lips.

4355
02:45:16,680 --> 02:45:17,300
Oh, wait.

4356
02:45:17,420 --> 02:45:18,420
This one was already...

4357
02:45:19,780 --> 02:45:21,160
I want to see what's over here.

4358
02:45:21,920 --> 02:45:23,440
Did someone finally hit the switch?

4359
02:45:23,740 --> 02:45:25,200
Can I finally escape here?

4360
02:45:25,700 --> 02:45:27,500
Please tell me how you got here.

4361
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:28,500
All right.

4362
02:45:28,580 --> 02:45:29,780
Let's keep him back in here.

4363
02:45:31,420 --> 02:45:31,860
Wait.

4364
02:45:31,900 --> 02:45:32,860
Is there any green mons?

4365
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:34,360
What do the green mons look like?

4366
02:45:34,760 --> 02:45:35,360
Oh, no.

4367
02:45:35,440 --> 02:45:36,560
It's just another bitty bud.

4368
02:45:36,840 --> 02:45:37,720
God damn it.

4369
02:45:37,880 --> 02:45:38,580
Get out of here.

4370
02:45:38,700 --> 02:45:39,840
Nobody likes you.

4371
02:45:41,020 --> 02:45:41,940
Sorry, Alan.

4372
02:45:43,560 --> 02:45:44,680
Not sorry.

4373
02:45:47,680 --> 02:45:48,380
All right.

4374
02:45:48,540 --> 02:45:49,140
Let's see.

4375
02:45:50,800 --> 02:45:51,740
Oh, my God.

4376
02:45:51,740 --> 02:45:53,360
There's so many foos here.

4377
02:45:53,940 --> 02:45:55,560
Actually, I'll kill one...

4378
02:45:55,560 --> 02:45:56,580
Oh, I actually killed him.

4379
02:45:57,300 --> 02:45:58,140
Not green.

4380
02:45:58,400 --> 02:45:59,020
What's the point?

4381
02:46:02,420 --> 02:46:03,500
Oh, my God.

4382
02:46:03,720 --> 02:46:05,300
It's literally just bitty buds.

4383
02:46:08,720 --> 02:46:09,060
Wait.

4384
02:46:09,240 --> 02:46:09,820
Can I fight you?

4385
02:46:10,960 --> 02:46:13,260
I mentioned to work out my pitching arm.

4386
02:46:13,420 --> 02:46:15,380
But nothing here is doing a trick.

4387
02:46:15,800 --> 02:46:17,360
Can you help me out?

4388
02:46:17,960 --> 02:46:18,260
Sure.

4389
02:46:18,440 --> 02:46:18,960
What do I do?

4390
02:46:19,640 --> 02:46:20,160
Perfect.

4391
02:46:20,380 --> 02:46:21,100
Let me just...

4392
02:46:21,100 --> 02:46:21,380
Oh, wait.

4393
02:46:21,440 --> 02:46:22,200
He's just going to chuck me.

4394
02:46:22,680 --> 02:46:23,820
Oh, I'm here now.

4395
02:46:24,320 --> 02:46:25,480
Still got it.

4396
02:46:25,480 --> 02:46:25,720
Okay.

4397
02:46:25,800 --> 02:46:27,280
That would have been unfortunately missed.

4398
02:46:28,220 --> 02:46:29,380
Oh, I got a metronome.

4399
02:46:29,720 --> 02:46:30,280
Is that TM?

4400
02:46:31,080 --> 02:46:31,600
Or...

4401
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:32,540
Oh, no.

4402
02:46:32,580 --> 02:46:33,080
It's an item.

4403
02:46:34,940 --> 02:46:35,800
Excuse me.

4404
02:46:36,280 --> 02:46:37,220
You have to get the...

4405
02:46:37,220 --> 02:46:37,920
Don't study.

4406
02:46:38,120 --> 02:46:39,160
No, desert from here.

4407
02:46:43,530 --> 02:46:44,250
All right.

4408
02:46:44,690 --> 02:46:46,410
Desert goer Loretto.

4409
02:46:47,210 --> 02:46:48,230
Oh, yes.

4410
02:46:48,710 --> 02:46:49,230
Pokey.

4411
02:46:50,010 --> 02:46:50,930
That's cute.

4412
02:46:52,630 --> 02:46:54,130
Oh, it's a held item.

4413
02:46:54,390 --> 02:46:55,230
As long as you say...

4414
02:46:55,230 --> 02:46:55,650
Oh, wait.

4415
02:46:55,690 --> 02:46:56,310
That's me.

4416
02:46:56,810 --> 02:46:57,070
Wait.

4417
02:46:57,070 --> 02:46:58,290
I should give metronome to that.

4418
02:46:58,390 --> 02:47:00,650
I just used fire charge.

4419
02:47:01,930 --> 02:47:03,370
That's like my go-to.

4420
02:47:07,140 --> 02:47:07,700
Yeah.

4421
02:47:11,480 --> 02:47:12,200
All right.

4422
02:47:12,580 --> 02:47:13,040
What moves...

4423
02:47:15,440 --> 02:47:16,000
Okay.

4424
02:47:16,200 --> 02:47:17,460
Delete move from spikes.

4425
02:47:17,660 --> 02:47:18,160
What is this?

4426
02:47:18,540 --> 02:47:19,540
No, we don't need that.

4427
02:47:19,840 --> 02:47:21,720
That's for that competitive gaming.

4428
02:47:22,280 --> 02:47:24,360
We ain't no competitive gamer here.

4429
02:47:28,160 --> 02:47:29,040
Oh, shit.

4430
02:47:29,180 --> 02:47:29,740
Yeah, you're licking.

4431
02:47:34,060 --> 02:47:35,020
That's right.

4432
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:37,880
You're gonna lick all the things.

4433
02:47:38,540 --> 02:47:38,640
Yeah.

4434
02:47:38,900 --> 02:47:39,360
Don't...

4435
02:47:39,360 --> 02:47:40,940
Spice are for nerds.

4436
02:47:43,860 --> 02:47:45,520
That's right, Dracoon.

4437
02:47:45,880 --> 02:47:48,980
I'll make sure you lick everything.

4438
02:47:49,480 --> 02:47:49,860
You know what?

4439
02:47:49,860 --> 02:47:50,780
Let me send you out.

4440
02:47:50,780 --> 02:47:52,080
How bad can it be?

4441
02:47:56,920 --> 02:47:57,960
How bad can it be?

4442
02:47:58,260 --> 02:47:59,700
Wait, that's a person.

4443
02:48:00,120 --> 02:48:00,640
Wait.

4444
02:48:01,140 --> 02:48:01,500
All right.

4445
02:48:01,620 --> 02:48:02,240
Lick him.

4446
02:48:06,860 --> 02:48:07,660
That's right.

4447
02:48:08,300 --> 02:48:10,200
Oh, it's not very effective.

4448
02:48:10,420 --> 02:48:10,580
All right.

4449
02:48:10,760 --> 02:48:10,980
That's...

4450
02:48:10,980 --> 02:48:12,600
That's all I wanted to do.

4451
02:48:12,800 --> 02:48:14,780
I sent you out.

4452
02:48:15,080 --> 02:48:16,620
Just threw you to lick him.

4453
02:48:19,340 --> 02:48:20,260
There we go.

4454
02:48:20,500 --> 02:48:21,620
Your job is done.

4455
02:48:22,300 --> 02:48:22,720
Your...

4456
02:48:27,240 --> 02:48:28,780
That's his entire job.

4457
02:48:33,620 --> 02:48:34,140
Nice.

4458
02:48:34,320 --> 02:48:35,020
Critical hit.

4459
02:48:35,220 --> 02:48:35,480
Nice.

4460
02:48:36,180 --> 02:48:37,880
Why is Yoshi looking like that?

4461
02:48:37,880 --> 02:48:41,900
Why is FABY Yoshi looking like that?

4462
02:48:42,120 --> 02:48:44,400
You forgot one important part.

4463
02:48:46,860 --> 02:48:48,440
Pops out of a cap.

4464
02:48:48,920 --> 02:48:49,460
Licks you.

4465
02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:50,140
Leaves.

4466
02:48:56,640 --> 02:48:57,220
All right.

4467
02:48:57,620 --> 02:48:57,900
Nice.

4468
02:48:58,320 --> 02:48:59,400
Found a super shroom.

4469
02:48:59,820 --> 02:49:00,580
Oh, God.

4470
02:49:03,560 --> 02:49:05,340
Yes, now you know.

4471
02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:07,800
Okay.

4472
02:49:08,800 --> 02:49:09,540
Oh, that's my dem.

4473
02:49:11,660 --> 02:49:13,820
Check out what I managed to get hold of.

4474
02:49:14,200 --> 02:49:14,500
Yeah?

4475
02:49:14,860 --> 02:49:15,760
I swear to God.

4476
02:49:15,840 --> 02:49:18,300
If it's a food toad, I swear to fucking God.

4477
02:49:18,860 --> 02:49:20,420
Oh, it's a bullet bill.

4478
02:49:20,720 --> 02:49:23,160
Oh, if I sat in front of it, I'd fight him.

4479
02:49:24,700 --> 02:49:25,920
Wait, what is...

4480
02:49:27,580 --> 02:49:28,960
What is bullet bill's type?

4481
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:32,520
He's my type, dude.

4482
02:49:32,920 --> 02:49:33,020
Yeah.

4483
02:49:37,610 --> 02:49:38,170
All right.

4484
02:49:38,210 --> 02:49:38,490
Nice.

4485
02:49:39,410 --> 02:49:40,050
Is this steel?

4486
02:49:41,630 --> 02:49:43,050
Oh, fuck.

4487
02:49:43,050 --> 02:49:43,210
Fuck.

4488
02:49:43,330 --> 02:49:43,510
Okay.

4489
02:49:43,790 --> 02:49:45,670
I actually like spiky more than bullet bill.

4490
02:49:45,930 --> 02:49:47,350
I mean, it's a bullet.

4491
02:49:49,070 --> 02:49:50,490
All right, Mr. Smartass.

4492
02:49:50,650 --> 02:49:51,170
He could be...

4493
02:49:51,170 --> 02:49:52,850
He could have flying as well.

4494
02:49:54,270 --> 02:49:55,130
It's a...

4495
02:49:55,130 --> 02:49:55,650
God damn.

4496
02:49:56,050 --> 02:49:56,270
Stop.

4497
02:49:56,410 --> 02:49:57,450
Stop sending me...

4498
02:49:57,450 --> 02:49:58,750
Stop sending bitty buds.

4499
02:50:02,940 --> 02:50:04,460
Can I be pew pew?

4500
02:50:04,920 --> 02:50:06,600
Silent Snake, thank you for the super chat.

4501
02:50:06,740 --> 02:50:06,980
Thank you.

4502
02:50:07,120 --> 02:50:07,700
Thank you.

4503
02:50:07,700 --> 02:50:09,840
We'll see what fate gets you guys.

4504
02:50:10,220 --> 02:50:11,120
Oh my God.

4505
02:50:11,260 --> 02:50:11,940
I keep hurting myself.

4506
02:50:12,320 --> 02:50:12,840
Dad, please.

4507
02:50:13,740 --> 02:50:14,140
Please.

4508
02:50:15,080 --> 02:50:16,360
Stop beating yourself up.

4509
02:50:16,480 --> 02:50:16,740
Please.

4510
02:50:17,660 --> 02:50:18,740
Oh, thank God.

4511
02:50:23,720 --> 02:50:24,520
Okay, nice.

4512
02:50:24,740 --> 02:50:25,300
Okay, it's 102.

4513
02:50:26,520 --> 02:50:27,040
Yippee!

4514
02:50:31,240 --> 02:50:31,840
All right.

4515
02:50:33,500 --> 02:50:33,940
Uh...

4516
02:50:33,940 --> 02:50:35,380
How do I activate this?

4517
02:50:35,580 --> 02:50:35,740
Here?

4518
02:50:36,220 --> 02:50:36,520
Oh.

4519
02:50:38,620 --> 02:50:39,940
Oh, it's another spiny.

4520
02:50:40,280 --> 02:50:41,120
Okay, I don't need it.

4521
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:42,300
I don't need another spiny.

4522
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:46,360
Oh.

4523
02:50:46,900 --> 02:50:48,200
I was like...

4524
02:50:48,200 --> 02:50:48,500
Yippee!

4525
02:50:48,580 --> 02:50:49,160
Your chest.

4526
02:50:50,820 --> 02:50:51,260
Uh...

4527
02:50:51,260 --> 02:50:51,940
Okay, I'm gonna...

4528
02:50:51,940 --> 02:50:52,920
I'll be able to kill it.

4529
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:54,020
So I should swap.

4530
02:50:54,880 --> 02:50:55,200
All right.

4531
02:50:55,200 --> 02:50:56,140
Who is like...

4532
02:50:56,140 --> 02:50:57,280
All right, Husky.

4533
02:50:57,380 --> 02:50:57,860
This is it.

4534
02:50:58,040 --> 02:50:59,220
This is your time to shine.

4535
02:50:59,800 --> 02:51:01,680
Your job is to weaken him.

4536
02:51:03,280 --> 02:51:03,780
All right.

4537
02:51:03,780 --> 02:51:04,400
You're getting punched.

4538
02:51:04,480 --> 02:51:04,840
But that's...

4539
02:51:04,840 --> 02:51:05,500
Okay, that's good.

4540
02:51:05,720 --> 02:51:06,640
He can't punch a...

4541
02:51:06,640 --> 02:51:08,200
You can't punch a plant.

4542
02:51:09,540 --> 02:51:09,980
Oh.

4543
02:51:10,240 --> 02:51:11,140
Oh, that's fine.

4544
02:51:11,140 --> 02:51:12,160
He's weak as fuck.

4545
02:51:15,240 --> 02:51:16,520
He can't punch a plant.

4546
02:51:16,640 --> 02:51:17,620
But you can cut it, though.

4547
02:51:18,240 --> 02:51:19,700
Which is a little worrisome.

4548
02:51:21,060 --> 02:51:21,700
Oh, okay.

4549
02:51:21,800 --> 02:51:22,200
It's fine.

4550
02:51:22,420 --> 02:51:22,680
It's fine.

4551
02:51:22,980 --> 02:51:24,300
If you die, it's okay.

4552
02:51:24,840 --> 02:51:25,920
You did your job.

4553
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:30,900
Yeah, you can't punch a bug.

4554
02:51:31,900 --> 02:51:32,700
Actually, you can.

4555
02:51:33,100 --> 02:51:33,860
Wait, never mind.

4556
02:51:40,630 --> 02:51:41,330
Oh, please.

4557
02:51:41,510 --> 02:51:41,630
Please.

4558
02:51:41,750 --> 02:51:42,330
I just need...

4559
02:51:42,330 --> 02:51:42,750
Okay, nice.

4560
02:51:43,450 --> 02:51:44,870
Got my plumber cap.

4561
02:51:47,290 --> 02:51:49,970
Bullet Bill should have the move where he just shoots a gun.

4562
02:51:50,130 --> 02:51:51,050
Like, he shoots like...

4563
02:51:51,050 --> 02:51:54,370
He pulls out a miniature gun and shoots miniature versions of himself.

4564
02:51:57,940 --> 02:51:58,460
Yay!

4565
02:51:59,460 --> 02:52:00,640
A living bullet.

4566
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:04,460
It is a simple-minded and is rarely changes its ways.

4567
02:52:04,720 --> 02:52:05,980
It does not usually reproduce.

4568
02:52:06,260 --> 02:52:08,680
Instead, new ones are born from a Bill blaster.

4569
02:52:09,400 --> 02:52:11,580
It does not usually reproduce.

4570
02:52:11,940 --> 02:52:13,060
Wait, what the fuck?

4571
02:52:13,780 --> 02:52:14,920
Wait, so like...

4572
02:52:14,920 --> 02:52:16,120
They can.

4573
02:52:16,380 --> 02:52:17,160
They just don't.

4574
02:52:17,500 --> 02:52:17,760
They...

4575
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:19,760
They just choose not to.

4576
02:52:21,940 --> 02:52:22,500
So...

4577
02:52:22,500 --> 02:52:23,580
All right.

4578
02:52:24,700 --> 02:52:26,240
Okay, who should it be?

4579
02:52:26,480 --> 02:52:28,580
Oh, this is a natural good one, too.

4580
02:52:33,060 --> 02:52:33,880
All right.

4581
02:52:34,060 --> 02:52:34,480
Solid.

4582
02:52:34,960 --> 02:52:36,460
You got the good one.

4583
02:52:36,600 --> 02:52:40,740
You actually got the 0.1% chance of actually getting what you want.

4584
02:52:41,640 --> 02:52:42,000
Solid.

4585
02:52:44,040 --> 02:52:44,700
Solid.

4586
02:52:45,720 --> 02:52:46,380
Goon.

4587
02:52:49,040 --> 02:52:51,540
The 0.1%.

4588
02:52:51,540 --> 02:52:52,180
Gotcha.

4589
02:52:52,640 --> 02:52:53,780
But you're still exiled.

4590
02:52:55,400 --> 02:52:57,960
And you get to be in the box with...

4591
02:52:57,960 --> 02:52:58,720
With John?

4592
02:52:59,260 --> 02:53:01,320
That's a win-win right there.

4593
02:53:03,900 --> 02:53:06,160
You got everything you've ever wanted.

4594
02:53:10,590 --> 02:53:13,270
I think I got all the encounters there, too.

4595
02:53:16,150 --> 02:53:17,030
That's the...

4596
02:53:17,030 --> 02:53:18,390
I'm going to see the warp pipe!

4597
02:53:18,730 --> 02:53:19,930
I didn't manage to finish reading.

4598
02:53:21,070 --> 02:53:22,970
Hiker Sirius would like to battle.

4599
02:53:28,840 --> 02:53:29,480
All right.

4600
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:30,000
Here we go.

4601
02:53:33,980 --> 02:53:34,500
Yay!

4602
02:53:35,320 --> 02:53:36,080
Oh, nice.

4603
02:53:36,260 --> 02:53:36,500
Oh, yeah.

4604
02:53:36,580 --> 02:53:37,500
Because it's steel.

4605
02:53:37,960 --> 02:53:39,520
And fire is good against steel.

4606
02:53:42,580 --> 02:53:43,660
Oh, it's brawler?

4607
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:44,460
All right.

4608
02:53:44,500 --> 02:53:45,060
You know what?

4609
02:53:46,060 --> 02:53:47,540
Who is water type again?

4610
02:53:47,540 --> 02:53:48,700
Okay, pro-goon.

4611
02:53:48,840 --> 02:53:49,540
Pro-goon.

4612
02:53:49,720 --> 02:53:50,580
This is it.

4613
02:53:50,780 --> 02:53:53,720
I'm finally using type advantage for the first time.

4614
02:53:54,760 --> 02:53:56,720
Because I think if I don't...

4615
02:53:56,720 --> 02:53:58,180
Dad's gonna die.

4616
02:54:01,580 --> 02:54:03,220
It's your time to sh...

4617
02:54:03,220 --> 02:54:03,960
Oh, my God.

4618
02:54:03,960 --> 02:54:05,480
You're so fucking weak.

4619
02:54:05,720 --> 02:54:05,980
Okay.

4620
02:54:06,020 --> 02:54:07,200
We're replacing you later.

4621
02:54:07,660 --> 02:54:08,060
We're...

4622
02:54:11,440 --> 02:54:14,440
If I didn't know, you could have lived.

4623
02:54:23,880 --> 02:54:29,940
When you give him a chance, he's gonna almost die to his...

4624
02:54:29,940 --> 02:54:31,340
To his count...

4625
02:54:31,340 --> 02:54:33,480
Like, to the count that he count is.

4626
02:54:35,100 --> 02:54:36,840
It's not his fault.

4627
02:54:37,440 --> 02:54:39,760
Brody was just super tanky.

4628
02:54:41,580 --> 02:54:42,680
Okay, Buzzy B.

4629
02:54:42,880 --> 02:54:43,120
Yes.

4630
02:54:43,320 --> 02:54:43,640
All right.

4631
02:54:43,900 --> 02:54:44,620
Back to that.

4632
02:54:44,760 --> 02:54:45,280
I knew it.

4633
02:54:46,020 --> 02:54:47,840
Never swap off your main guy.

4634
02:54:48,160 --> 02:54:49,580
Never swap off your starter.

4635
02:54:50,220 --> 02:54:52,440
Doesn't matter if he's, like, hanged by the thread.

4636
02:54:52,800 --> 02:54:54,200
Never swap off.

4637
02:54:57,860 --> 02:54:59,260
Level him then.

4638
02:54:59,500 --> 02:55:00,020
Oh, no.

4639
02:55:00,200 --> 02:55:00,500
Oh, wait.

4640
02:55:00,540 --> 02:55:01,420
It's not very effective.

4641
02:55:01,560 --> 02:55:01,900
That's good.

4642
02:55:03,700 --> 02:55:04,660
Level him?

4643
02:55:05,240 --> 02:55:06,300
What does that mean?

4644
02:55:07,800 --> 02:55:08,960
What does that mean?

4645
02:55:11,400 --> 02:55:13,300
Never swap off your carry.

4646
02:55:13,660 --> 02:55:13,880
Exactly.

4647
02:55:17,300 --> 02:55:17,820
Starter?

4648
02:55:17,960 --> 02:55:18,120
Yes.

4649
02:55:18,380 --> 02:55:20,580
He's my starter and he's the ender.

4650
02:55:20,700 --> 02:55:21,140
Exactly.

4651
02:55:22,080 --> 02:55:24,240
Hey, do you want to know how these bullet launchers work?

4652
02:55:24,400 --> 02:55:24,820
Yeah, sure.

4653
02:55:26,100 --> 02:55:29,580
All you gotta do is go up to them, interact with them like this.

4654
02:55:29,820 --> 02:55:30,540
Then, boom.

4655
02:55:30,800 --> 02:55:32,660
It's now facing directly at you.

4656
02:55:33,640 --> 02:55:35,600
Careful not safe front when it's firing, though.

4657
02:55:35,780 --> 02:55:38,200
You have a nice encounter with a bullet bill.

4658
02:55:39,800 --> 02:55:40,680
Okay, so...

4659
02:55:40,680 --> 02:55:42,180
I didn't do it here, anyway.

4660
02:55:42,860 --> 02:55:43,380
There you go.

4661
02:55:43,840 --> 02:55:44,620
It's that easy.

4662
02:55:47,580 --> 02:55:48,020
Uh...

4663
02:55:48,020 --> 02:55:48,320
Wait.

4664
02:55:48,660 --> 02:55:50,680
What happens if I...

4665
02:55:53,040 --> 02:55:53,700
Oh, nice.

4666
02:55:53,760 --> 02:55:54,400
I got a nugget.

4667
02:55:57,580 --> 02:55:58,160
All right.

4668
02:55:59,480 --> 02:55:59,920
Uh...

4669
02:55:59,920 --> 02:56:01,340
Wait, but what happens if I do this?

4670
02:56:01,540 --> 02:56:02,440
Oops, that's not it.

4671
02:56:03,800 --> 02:56:05,120
What happens if I do that?

4672
02:56:06,480 --> 02:56:08,140
Oh, nothing happens.

4673
02:56:08,440 --> 02:56:08,600
Okay.

4674
02:56:09,480 --> 02:56:11,360
I thought I would open another area.

4675
02:56:11,660 --> 02:56:13,920
I realized I already got to the end of the area.

4676
02:56:14,620 --> 02:56:15,440
Down I go.

4677
02:56:18,730 --> 02:56:20,050
Town of the clouds.

4678
02:56:20,470 --> 02:56:21,170
Oh, I'm back.

4679
02:56:21,310 --> 02:56:22,350
I'm in the city now.

4680
02:56:24,210 --> 02:56:25,450
Welcome to cloud...

4681
02:56:25,450 --> 02:56:26,270
Cloud cap.

4682
02:56:26,550 --> 02:56:28,570
The mushroom of town above the clouds.

4683
02:56:28,770 --> 02:56:29,970
Things have been peaceful lately.

4684
02:56:30,170 --> 02:56:33,050
Thanks to Princess Daisy's commandeering Bowser's airship.

4685
02:57:01,290 --> 02:57:03,010
It's inconceivable that town council won't add hand wheels.

4686
02:57:12,360 --> 02:57:14,080
Is it that the bullet bill encountered?

4687
02:57:14,240 --> 02:57:15,600
But I got a bullet bill already.

4688
02:57:16,240 --> 02:57:18,000
If I hit myself with a bullet.

4689
02:57:18,740 --> 02:57:19,560
Hey, Mario!

4690
02:57:19,880 --> 02:57:20,940
Do I do it for you?

4691
02:57:21,560 --> 02:57:23,000
You're surely not going to pass it up.

4692
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:27,900
It's a one extremely rare, extremely powerful button-a-boo.

4693
02:57:28,320 --> 02:57:34,220
I have a fresh ultra-rare button-a-boo that I'm graciously willing to sell you for generous 500 coins.

4694
02:57:34,400 --> 02:57:35,180
Well, $500.

4695
02:57:35,760 --> 02:57:36,940
That's my Mario.

4696
02:57:37,320 --> 02:57:38,800
I'll be taking that.

4697
02:57:39,540 --> 02:57:44,480
And use your bonafide, ultra-rare, and useful button-a-boo.

4698
02:57:45,140 --> 02:57:45,760
Change it.

4699
02:57:45,760 --> 02:57:46,700
Or don't.

4700
02:57:47,300 --> 02:57:49,020
I can't really care unless that...

4701
02:57:49,020 --> 02:57:49,800
What a deal!

4702
02:57:52,440 --> 02:57:53,740
What's a pot-a-boo?

4703
02:57:54,160 --> 02:57:55,040
Wait, what is that?

4704
02:57:57,340 --> 02:57:58,280
No way!

4705
02:57:58,400 --> 02:57:59,800
A toad would not scare me.

4706
02:57:59,860 --> 02:58:01,460
He's not smart enough for that.

4707
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:02,440
Look!

4708
02:58:03,540 --> 02:58:05,180
Oh, he's so cute!

4709
02:58:06,300 --> 02:58:07,540
Wait, he's fire!

4710
02:58:09,200 --> 02:58:10,360
Prevents freezing.

4711
02:58:11,200 --> 02:58:14,420
Wait, he's actually better than a fucking Magikarp.

4712
02:58:15,460 --> 02:58:16,740
What do you mean scam?

4713
02:58:17,060 --> 02:58:17,820
Look at him!

4714
02:58:18,900 --> 02:58:20,420
I already have a fire-type, so...

4715
02:58:21,880 --> 02:58:22,320
Wait.

4716
02:58:22,800 --> 02:58:23,580
Let me see.

4717
02:58:23,640 --> 02:58:24,060
How do I...

4718
02:58:24,060 --> 02:58:26,000
Okay, I need to put in my party to nickname him.

4719
02:58:26,520 --> 02:58:27,420
Alright, give me a sec.

4720
02:58:27,500 --> 02:58:29,460
You're just gonna be there for one second, Husky.

4721
02:58:29,580 --> 02:58:30,100
Don't worry.

4722
02:58:30,440 --> 02:58:31,700
I'll replace you later.

4723
02:58:34,220 --> 02:58:37,540
I ain't having no bug Pokemon in my party.

4724
02:58:37,720 --> 02:58:38,500
Alright, nickname.

4725
02:58:39,060 --> 02:58:39,500
Alright!

4726
02:58:40,060 --> 02:58:42,280
Who was it that wanted to be a Bullet Bill?

4727
02:58:42,580 --> 02:58:44,200
Well, here's your lucky day.

4728
02:58:44,200 --> 02:58:46,040
You get to be something even better.

4729
02:58:46,380 --> 02:58:47,520
Um, this guy.

4730
02:58:47,780 --> 02:58:48,600
This guy.

4731
02:58:51,440 --> 02:58:53,200
I'll call you...

4732
02:58:53,820 --> 02:58:55,280
Pee-goon.

4733
02:58:55,760 --> 02:58:56,440
Hehehehe.

4734
02:58:57,180 --> 02:58:57,860
Hehehehe.

4735
02:58:58,280 --> 02:58:58,960
Alright.

4736
02:59:01,200 --> 02:59:02,940
He's almost like a bullet.

4737
02:59:03,780 --> 02:59:05,540
He's practically a bullet.

4738
02:59:06,340 --> 02:59:09,600
It's just that instead of made of steel, he's just lava.

4739
02:59:10,040 --> 02:59:10,380
Oh, wait.

4740
02:59:10,440 --> 02:59:11,260
I need to...

4741
02:59:12,620 --> 02:59:14,080
There's my Pee-goon.

4742
02:59:16,420 --> 02:59:16,900
Alright.

4743
02:59:17,160 --> 02:59:18,340
Let's be put you in here.

4744
02:59:19,940 --> 02:59:21,700
Maybe I should, like, have a...

4745
02:59:21,700 --> 02:59:22,400
You know what?

4746
02:59:22,620 --> 02:59:24,440
Every foo I see, I'll catch.

4747
02:59:31,520 --> 02:59:33,960
So we can make sure everybody has a fun time.

4748
02:59:35,960 --> 02:59:36,840
Oh, no.

4749
02:59:41,620 --> 02:59:44,440
I thought I'd be able to find some sweet deals on the square today.

4750
02:59:44,700 --> 02:59:47,520
But seems like that over there is talking politics again.

4751
02:59:47,620 --> 02:59:48,400
Oh my god, what?

4752
02:59:48,680 --> 02:59:50,460
What kind of politics are you talking here?

4753
02:59:50,860 --> 02:59:53,300
Now I'm scared to ask, but can I be a thump?

4754
02:59:53,740 --> 02:59:55,440
Not so dead, but thank you for the super chat.

4755
02:59:55,580 --> 02:59:55,800
Thank you.

4756
02:59:55,960 --> 02:59:56,400
Thank you.

4757
02:59:56,880 --> 02:59:59,740
Looks like I'm not going to be able to get any thump here today either.

4758
03:00:00,240 --> 03:00:02,020
Better head on over to the store instead.

4759
03:00:02,860 --> 03:00:04,280
Don't worry, not so dead, poor.

4760
03:00:04,880 --> 03:00:06,420
I got you something better.

4761
03:00:12,260 --> 03:00:14,160
Mark, thank you for the super chat.

4762
03:00:14,320 --> 03:00:15,280
Thank you, thank you.

4763
03:00:15,940 --> 03:00:19,440
I feel like the PC is getting a little busy.

4764
03:00:19,980 --> 03:00:21,700
Oh, not the bitty buds, though.

4765
03:00:24,280 --> 03:00:24,880
Oh,

4766
03:00:30,300 --> 03:00:30,820
you're lucky.

4767
03:00:32,680 --> 03:00:34,900
It's the invasion of the bitty...

4768
03:00:34,900 --> 03:00:36,940
They're guarding the...

4769
03:00:36,940 --> 03:00:39,260
They're guarding the other bonds.

4770
03:00:41,980 --> 03:00:44,340
They're like, take me instead.

4771
03:00:47,880 --> 03:00:48,800
Don't worry.

4772
03:00:49,400 --> 03:00:50,480
I'm patient.

4773
03:00:53,320 --> 03:00:53,920
Alright.

4774
03:00:55,220 --> 03:00:58,400
Let me send out Dragoon here.

4775
03:01:02,260 --> 03:01:03,120
Oh, yeah.

4776
03:01:03,380 --> 03:01:04,000
Yeah, Piku.

4777
03:01:04,600 --> 03:01:07,380
Hey, Dougie, do you know that Piku sounds like butt and bannery?

4778
03:01:07,780 --> 03:01:09,200
Jay, thank you for the super chat.

4779
03:01:09,200 --> 03:01:11,140
There you think you'll go lick him.

4780
03:01:17,220 --> 03:01:18,340
Another one.

4781
03:01:24,740 --> 03:01:26,360
Love my Dragoon.

4782
03:01:27,360 --> 03:01:28,680
My little guy.

4783
03:01:29,480 --> 03:01:29,700
Alright.

4784
03:01:34,280 --> 03:01:36,940
He's a little freaky one there.

4785
03:01:39,280 --> 03:01:41,000
Not so good.

4786
03:01:41,780 --> 03:01:42,060
Crit.

4787
03:01:42,300 --> 03:01:42,720
Crit.

4788
03:01:43,040 --> 03:01:43,460
Crit him.

4789
03:01:46,860 --> 03:01:47,960
Alright, nice.

4790
03:01:52,990 --> 03:01:53,670
Alright.

4791
03:01:56,170 --> 03:01:57,110
Look, John.

4792
03:01:57,350 --> 03:01:58,110
You got some help.

4793
03:02:02,290 --> 03:02:04,310
Oh, and it's also female.

4794
03:02:04,550 --> 03:02:07,090
Why am I catching all the female ones?

4795
03:02:12,330 --> 03:02:12,810
Alright.

4796
03:02:18,210 --> 03:02:19,450
Alright, where do I need to go?

4797
03:02:19,650 --> 03:02:20,390
Oh, I need to go here.

4798
03:02:21,990 --> 03:02:22,110
Oh.

4799
03:02:22,390 --> 03:02:23,050
You need something?

4800
03:02:23,470 --> 03:02:25,550
I'm getting ready for the trek to the airship.

4801
03:02:26,230 --> 03:02:27,410
Oh, no.

4802
03:02:28,970 --> 03:02:30,330
Yeah, yeah, Grandpa.

4803
03:02:30,950 --> 03:02:33,510
There's a million times you told the council story.

4804
03:02:33,990 --> 03:02:35,810
There's been literally anything else.

4805
03:02:36,190 --> 03:02:36,350
Please.

4806
03:02:39,680 --> 03:02:45,020
Back in my day, we used to have an entire council of toads.

4807
03:02:45,280 --> 03:02:47,460
Why won't anyone believe me?

4808
03:02:48,720 --> 03:02:51,420
Grandpa, I don't think that's a good thing, Grandpa.

4809
03:02:52,020 --> 03:02:55,340
Maybe, like, you know, we gotta have, like, other types...

4810
03:02:55,340 --> 03:02:57,340
Other types of citizens in the council.

4811
03:02:58,320 --> 03:02:58,620
Sure!

4812
03:02:58,920 --> 03:03:02,080
Don't tell my wife that I got some special berries!

4813
03:03:02,420 --> 03:03:04,200
That were a battle against Daisy!

4814
03:03:04,640 --> 03:03:05,380
Oh, nice.

4815
03:03:05,860 --> 03:03:06,620
Oh, wait!

4816
03:03:06,680 --> 03:03:10,060
This toad married outside of toads!

4817
03:03:10,260 --> 03:03:11,340
Oh, my God!

4818
03:03:11,960 --> 03:03:12,900
My wife...

4819
03:03:12,900 --> 03:03:13,420
Wait, what?

4820
03:03:14,100 --> 03:03:15,660
My wife loves to hear...

4821
03:03:15,660 --> 03:03:16,620
Wait, this is not the wife?

4822
03:03:16,620 --> 03:03:17,700
Who's this guy?

4823
03:03:18,380 --> 03:03:20,680
I thought this toad married him!

4824
03:03:21,940 --> 03:03:23,440
My wife loves to hear...

4825
03:03:23,440 --> 03:03:26,380
I gotta get that pirate star from Daisy to ensure happiness.

4826
03:03:26,800 --> 03:03:29,940
I better find ways to prepare a deal with ground type...

4827
03:03:29,940 --> 03:03:30,140
Wait!

4828
03:03:31,780 --> 03:03:33,840
Are they both...

4829
03:03:34,500 --> 03:03:35,060
Oh!

4830
03:03:36,220 --> 03:03:37,200
They're both...

4831
03:03:37,200 --> 03:03:38,620
Oh, I thought this was a man!

4832
03:03:38,940 --> 03:03:39,500
Toad!

4833
03:03:39,820 --> 03:03:40,280
Oh!

4834
03:03:43,200 --> 03:03:44,660
I was like, wait a minute.

4835
03:03:45,940 --> 03:03:46,500
Oh!

4836
03:03:48,320 --> 03:03:48,880
Lesbians!

4837
03:03:49,500 --> 03:03:50,300
I see!

4838
03:03:53,980 --> 03:03:54,540
Yuri!

4839
03:03:55,920 --> 03:03:57,980
This is a great spot for my future home.

4840
03:03:58,160 --> 03:04:00,880
And with that loan I got on Main Street...

4841
03:04:00,880 --> 03:04:03,760
I have the capital to make it a reality.

4842
03:04:04,420 --> 03:04:07,460
Now then, do you think the realtors around me accept purple coins?

4843
03:04:11,300 --> 03:04:13,320
Koomba, I don't know if you're allowed to live here.

4844
03:04:13,940 --> 03:04:15,720
Also, I don't think it's safe for you.

4845
03:04:16,600 --> 03:04:17,060
Strange!

4846
03:04:17,400 --> 03:04:18,540
How'd I even end up here?

4847
03:04:18,820 --> 03:04:19,500
Oh, well.

4848
03:04:19,820 --> 03:04:21,100
Better make the most of it.

4849
03:04:21,600 --> 03:04:22,180
Hey, you.

4850
03:04:22,360 --> 03:04:22,880
Over here.

4851
03:04:23,360 --> 03:04:23,720
Who?

4852
03:04:24,020 --> 03:04:25,540
Oh, is that Captain Toad?

4853
03:04:27,860 --> 03:04:29,380
Hey, wait a minute.

4854
03:04:29,720 --> 03:04:30,440
You're Mario.

4855
03:04:31,260 --> 03:04:32,040
Oh, thank goodness.

4856
03:04:32,420 --> 03:04:33,280
I'm saved.

4857
03:04:34,020 --> 03:04:35,720
I'm Captain Toad.

4858
03:04:35,860 --> 03:04:36,820
Don't ask out.

4859
03:04:37,080 --> 03:04:38,300
But I'm stuck here.

4860
03:04:39,020 --> 03:04:41,060
Do you think you can find a way to save me?

4861
03:04:41,600 --> 03:04:43,400
I'll make it worth your while.

4862
03:04:44,260 --> 03:04:44,900
Oh, wait.

4863
03:04:45,840 --> 03:04:47,680
Maybe there's a lock to do somewhere around here.

4864
03:04:48,060 --> 03:04:52,440
If not, I hear Princess Daisy's in the air with a whole airship.

4865
03:04:52,900 --> 03:04:55,540
Though I don't know how you convinced her to use it to help me.

4866
03:04:56,200 --> 03:04:57,660
Oh, I want Daisy to help you.

4867
03:04:58,540 --> 03:04:59,520
You seem like a nice guy.

4868
03:04:59,540 --> 03:05:00,480
You have your own game.

4869
03:05:01,780 --> 03:05:03,340
You're Mario, aren't you?

4870
03:05:04,100 --> 03:05:06,740
I'm Mario Bowser was recently sitting around here.

4871
03:05:06,980 --> 03:05:10,140
I just can't help but worry for my family's safety.

4872
03:05:10,700 --> 03:05:11,740
Am I taking a CM?

4873
03:05:12,480 --> 03:05:13,560
All right, nice.

4874
03:05:13,960 --> 03:05:14,660
What did I get?

4875
03:05:15,220 --> 03:05:16,360
Let him ride.

4876
03:05:17,060 --> 03:05:18,560
I never played Captain Toad.

4877
03:05:19,780 --> 03:05:21,000
My sister...

4878
03:05:21,160 --> 03:05:21,400
Sister?

4879
03:05:23,460 --> 03:05:26,220
There's no way Daisy will let Bowser anywhere near us.

4880
03:05:26,360 --> 03:05:27,180
Oh my god.

4881
03:05:29,540 --> 03:05:33,000
It's like citizens come here to escape Princess...

4882
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:38,460
Like, to escape the tyranny of Toad Town and Princess Peach.

4883
03:05:38,640 --> 03:05:41,600
And, like, be whoever they want to be with.

4884
03:05:41,740 --> 03:05:43,400
With no prejudice...

4885
03:05:43,400 --> 03:05:44,420
What so ever.

4886
03:05:44,920 --> 03:05:48,920
Look at how inclusive and diversified this place is.

4887
03:05:49,140 --> 03:05:49,660
You know what?

4888
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:54,120
I think Daisy is a better princess than Princess Peach.

4889
03:05:57,040 --> 03:05:57,720
Sigh!

4890
03:06:00,960 --> 03:06:03,520
Princess Daisy is so dreamy.

4891
03:06:03,820 --> 03:06:07,920
She even managed to steal that airship from Bowser, soaring through the skies.

4892
03:06:08,500 --> 03:06:10,300
Showing all the world her beauty.

4893
03:06:12,620 --> 03:06:13,700
Hey, Mario!

4894
03:06:14,340 --> 03:06:16,340
I'd be careful going ahead to Toad Town.

4895
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,980
Bowser has recently been spotted in the area.

4896
03:06:20,660 --> 03:06:23,180
I don't think he's been all happy since his airship got stolen.

4897
03:06:25,060 --> 03:06:27,660
I don't understand what these girls see in Princess Daisy.

4898
03:06:28,060 --> 03:06:30,760
I mean, they're much more beautiful things in this world.

4899
03:06:31,860 --> 03:06:33,200
We love Tomboys.

4900
03:06:33,320 --> 03:06:33,840
Kuma, thank you.

4901
03:06:33,940 --> 03:06:34,760
Super chap, thank you.

4902
03:06:35,080 --> 03:06:35,440
Thank you.

4903
03:06:35,980 --> 03:06:38,540
We can't even see Rainbow run from here for Star's sake.

4904
03:06:38,700 --> 03:06:41,420
Oh, he doesn't like the pop progressive, Daisy.

4905
03:06:42,900 --> 03:06:44,360
Daisy's rule is...

4906
03:06:44,360 --> 03:06:51,140
Oh my god, no wonder the grandpa was like, Back in my day, the council was only Toad's.

4907
03:06:51,340 --> 03:06:54,200
Oh my god, the grandpa's racist.

4908
03:06:54,620 --> 03:06:56,120
I just realized.

4909
03:07:00,260 --> 03:07:01,360
Hey you!

4910
03:07:01,700 --> 03:07:02,800
Come by, Star.

4911
03:07:03,060 --> 03:07:04,680
You won't regret it.

4912
03:07:05,240 --> 03:07:05,740
Oh no.

4913
03:07:06,640 --> 03:07:08,720
It all makes sense now.

4914
03:07:10,700 --> 03:07:14,300
I can't believe the grandpa's racist.

4915
03:07:15,860 --> 03:07:17,540
Okay, we need...

4916
03:07:17,540 --> 03:07:18,880
We'll get...

4917
03:07:18,880 --> 03:07:19,160
Three more.

4918
03:07:20,900 --> 03:07:22,620
I called it.

4919
03:07:25,560 --> 03:07:28,380
I feel like usually these guys don't...

4920
03:07:28,380 --> 03:07:30,160
Usually don't say much.

4921
03:07:31,280 --> 03:07:32,140
Grandpa.

4922
03:07:32,620 --> 03:07:33,740
Grandpa, no!

4923
03:07:36,380 --> 03:07:37,600
Let's go.

4924
03:07:39,920 --> 03:07:40,720
Oh, what?

4925
03:07:41,960 --> 03:07:43,800
Oh, this is Cloud City?

4926
03:07:47,980 --> 03:07:49,320
Alright, let's see.

4927
03:07:51,160 --> 03:07:51,860
Oh dear.

4928
03:07:52,160 --> 03:07:54,120
It seems the Koopa Troopa is taking over his route!

4929
03:07:54,420 --> 03:07:57,060
There's not much a loaded guy like me can do against him!

4930
03:07:57,600 --> 03:07:58,780
Wait, why are you fighting me?

4931
03:07:59,060 --> 03:08:00,900
Oh no, it was some random while.

4932
03:08:01,080 --> 03:08:01,780
I was like...

4933
03:08:01,780 --> 03:08:02,720
I was like...

4934
03:08:02,720 --> 03:08:05,140
I can't guard, so I'll fight you instead.

4935
03:08:05,720 --> 03:08:07,120
I was like so confused.

4936
03:08:08,940 --> 03:08:15,580
You can do one space jump for the raw nut or you can attempt the one space diagonal jump for the super nut.

4937
03:08:15,900 --> 03:08:16,580
You know what?

4938
03:08:16,880 --> 03:08:18,240
I got this.

4939
03:08:22,760 --> 03:08:23,920
Guys, did I do it?

4940
03:08:24,640 --> 03:08:25,880
Oh yeah, you got me!

4941
03:08:26,800 --> 03:08:29,040
Bro, you need to stop telling people to make that jump.

4942
03:08:29,040 --> 03:08:30,460
It's literally impossible.

4943
03:08:30,560 --> 03:08:34,700
Here in Cloud Kingdom, no one chooses to jump for the super nut.

4944
03:08:34,920 --> 03:08:43,380
It's better to be safe until the one space jump for the nut rather than risk 1,500 coins for just 20...

4945
03:08:43,380 --> 03:08:44,560
What?!

4946
03:08:45,740 --> 03:08:46,920
He took back...

4947
03:08:46,920 --> 03:08:48,480
I got scammed!

4948
03:08:49,980 --> 03:08:50,780
I'm

4949
03:08:55,410 --> 03:08:57,590
fucking scammed all of them!

4950
03:08:58,870 --> 03:09:00,430
They ran up!

4951
03:09:00,670 --> 03:09:03,050
It's like, what's that thing called?

4952
03:09:03,370 --> 03:09:07,310
They literally like, fucking set the shit up!

4953
03:09:07,630 --> 03:09:09,990
You are not a parkour guy.

4954
03:09:15,250 --> 03:09:16,430
Guys, I didn't get...

4955
03:09:16,430 --> 03:09:18,130
I didn't save, guys.

4956
03:09:21,250 --> 03:09:22,650
No one jumped.

4957
03:09:22,870 --> 03:09:24,170
It was a set up!

4958
03:09:24,350 --> 03:09:25,790
They sent me up!

4959
03:09:27,250 --> 03:09:29,650
I wish the council was still around.

4960
03:09:33,350 --> 03:09:38,230
We let those shy guys into this town and look what happened.

4961
03:09:40,850 --> 03:09:44,190
We shouldn't have let those shy guys in here.

4962
03:09:48,010 --> 03:09:51,130
Mario, you're fast but not fast enough.

4963
03:09:51,730 --> 03:09:52,450
Goons!

4964
03:09:52,930 --> 03:09:55,090
Please don't call us that, Lord Bowser.

4965
03:09:55,530 --> 03:09:57,050
Okay, look, there's a goon.

4966
03:09:57,370 --> 03:09:58,410
Oh, sorry.

4967
03:10:00,550 --> 03:10:01,310
Minions!

4968
03:10:01,750 --> 03:10:04,150
They already got goons.

4969
03:10:05,570 --> 03:10:06,830
You hear that, Johnson?

4970
03:10:07,130 --> 03:10:08,030
We're minions!

4971
03:10:08,490 --> 03:10:08,630
Woo!

4972
03:10:09,790 --> 03:10:12,750
I gotta tell my wife about the promotion, Timmy!

4973
03:10:13,150 --> 03:10:13,650
Woo-hoo!

4974
03:10:14,910 --> 03:10:16,710
Will you two quiet down?

4975
03:10:17,050 --> 03:10:19,150
Your king is about to command you.

4976
03:10:19,750 --> 03:10:21,610
Super charge the launchers!

4977
03:10:23,750 --> 03:10:24,890
What am I supposed to do?

4978
03:10:25,010 --> 03:10:25,370
Oh, wait.

4979
03:10:25,450 --> 03:10:26,950
Am I just gonna get bullet-billed?

4980
03:10:26,950 --> 03:10:28,610
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

4981
03:10:28,990 --> 03:10:30,630
Now they lock on and are automatic.

4982
03:10:30,790 --> 03:10:31,690
Goodbye, Mario!

4983
03:10:32,230 --> 03:10:32,910
Hey, bro!

4984
03:10:33,190 --> 03:10:34,310
I'm over here!

4985
03:10:35,150 --> 03:10:35,830
What?

4986
03:10:39,540 --> 03:10:40,920
Oh, no!

4987
03:10:42,980 --> 03:10:43,640
Ah!

4988
03:10:44,820 --> 03:10:46,040
Wait right there!

4989
03:10:46,220 --> 03:10:47,960
I'm coming over, Mario!

4990
03:10:47,960 --> 03:10:48,160
There we go!

4991
03:10:51,260 --> 03:10:51,700
Oh!

4992
03:10:52,280 --> 03:10:53,240
Oh, my God!

4993
03:10:53,420 --> 03:10:54,180
Oh, my God!

4994
03:10:54,460 --> 03:10:55,060
Look at those!

4995
03:10:55,440 --> 03:10:56,660
Close one, am I right?

4996
03:10:57,360 --> 03:10:59,400
That was a little too much excitement for me.

4997
03:10:59,560 --> 03:11:01,300
So, I'm gonna head back to town.

4998
03:11:02,360 --> 03:11:04,500
Yeah, go ahead and beat down Bowser for me.

4999
03:11:04,600 --> 03:11:05,040
Got it?

5000
03:11:05,200 --> 03:11:06,020
Good luck, bro!

5001
03:11:06,900 --> 03:11:08,180
Bro, he's got the moons!

5002
03:11:08,560 --> 03:11:09,860
Why can't you do that regularly?

5003
03:11:13,800 --> 03:11:14,600
Is it just...

5004
03:11:14,600 --> 03:11:15,480
Oh, wait, but they're red.

5005
03:11:15,680 --> 03:11:16,780
Wait, are they different?

5006
03:11:18,580 --> 03:11:20,460
Oh, wait, they're shiny!

5007
03:11:22,780 --> 03:11:24,380
Gus, thank you for the super chat.

5008
03:11:24,500 --> 03:11:24,740
Thank you.

5009
03:11:24,900 --> 03:11:25,400
Thank you.

5010
03:11:26,200 --> 03:11:27,040
Alright, we'll see.

5011
03:11:28,620 --> 03:11:29,980
We'll see if you can.

5012
03:11:33,120 --> 03:11:35,040
There's, like, so many of them, though.

5013
03:11:35,320 --> 03:11:37,120
They're not that special if they're shiny.

5014
03:11:43,270 --> 03:11:44,190
Alright, nice.

5015
03:11:48,360 --> 03:11:48,820
Yay!

5016
03:11:50,600 --> 03:11:52,540
It's, like, a red Gyarados.

5017
03:11:53,340 --> 03:11:55,360
But, like, there's 20 of them.

5018
03:11:57,320 --> 03:11:58,880
Sorry, P-goon.

5019
03:12:03,320 --> 03:12:05,200
This could've been you.

5020
03:12:07,380 --> 03:12:08,040
It's...

5021
03:12:08,040 --> 03:12:09,200
Red is faster.

5022
03:12:09,200 --> 03:12:09,780
You're right.

5023
03:12:12,800 --> 03:12:13,680
Let's see.

5024
03:12:14,860 --> 03:12:16,340
Do we give...

5025
03:12:16,340 --> 03:12:18,860
Let's have to counsel the side of your face.

5026
03:12:18,960 --> 03:12:21,620
Do we give Gus his bullet bill?

5027
03:12:22,500 --> 03:12:24,540
Do we give Gus his Gus-goon?

5028
03:12:27,600 --> 03:12:28,900
Yay or nay?

5029
03:12:29,380 --> 03:12:29,980
Yes.

5030
03:12:30,500 --> 03:12:31,720
I didn't know I could...

5031
03:12:31,720 --> 03:12:33,240
There could be red Pew Pews.

5032
03:12:33,340 --> 03:12:35,960
Can you kill my last incarnation?

5033
03:12:35,960 --> 03:12:38,840
Solid, thank you for the super chat.

5034
03:12:39,040 --> 03:12:40,280
Thank you, thank you.

5035
03:12:40,860 --> 03:12:41,820
Yay or nay?

5036
03:12:42,260 --> 03:12:43,120
Gus-goon.

5037
03:12:45,380 --> 03:12:46,740
Alright, I see...

5038
03:12:46,740 --> 03:12:47,460
Gus, you're...

5039
03:12:47,460 --> 03:12:48,940
The counsel has decided.

5040
03:12:49,140 --> 03:12:50,720
There's more yes than nays.

5041
03:12:51,040 --> 03:12:52,720
You are lucky they like you.

5042
03:12:54,040 --> 03:12:55,600
Or you would have...

5043
03:12:55,600 --> 03:12:56,920
The food face.

5044
03:12:57,480 --> 03:12:58,160
Hehehehehe.

5045
03:12:58,720 --> 03:12:59,040
Hehehehehe.

5046
03:12:59,040 --> 03:12:59,120
Hehehehehe.

5047
03:12:59,120 --> 03:12:59,360
Hehehehe.

5048
03:13:00,080 --> 03:13:00,760
Hehehehe.

5049
03:13:01,540 --> 03:13:03,260
You could've been food.

5050
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:04,680
Hehehehe.

5051
03:13:04,680 --> 03:13:04,900
Hehehehe.

5052
03:13:09,020 --> 03:13:11,060
I bet you never faced these before.

5053
03:13:15,840 --> 03:13:17,180
Oh, he looks cool.

5054
03:13:17,980 --> 03:13:19,300
Wait, that looks so cool.

5055
03:13:19,460 --> 03:13:20,320
The trooper grunt.

5056
03:13:21,960 --> 03:13:22,320
Alright.

5057
03:13:22,740 --> 03:13:23,120
Goodbye.

5058
03:13:24,360 --> 03:13:25,880
I've used fire.

5059
03:13:32,520 --> 03:13:33,940
Goodbye, bullet pee.

5060
03:13:37,020 --> 03:13:37,620
Yay.

5061
03:13:37,840 --> 03:13:38,320
Oh, 69.

5062
03:13:38,560 --> 03:13:38,760
Nice.

5063
03:13:42,060 --> 03:13:42,700
Yeah, right.

5064
03:13:42,800 --> 03:13:43,360
The goon.

5065
03:13:43,480 --> 03:13:44,660
Wait, is it just all bullets?

5066
03:13:46,300 --> 03:13:47,900
He's just trying to shoot me.

5067
03:13:52,760 --> 03:13:53,200
Yippee!

5068
03:13:57,440 --> 03:13:58,720
Bro, it's a mare.

5069
03:13:58,920 --> 03:13:59,820
Oh my god.

5070
03:14:00,560 --> 03:14:02,200
Oh, I wonder what else is he gonna send.

5071
03:14:02,400 --> 03:14:02,740
Oh, wow.

5072
03:14:02,840 --> 03:14:04,140
Another bullet bill?

5073
03:14:04,800 --> 03:14:05,920
Okay, but...

5074
03:14:05,920 --> 03:14:06,460
Oh, it's like...

5075
03:14:06,460 --> 03:14:07,820
It's basically like Team Rocket.

5076
03:14:08,660 --> 03:14:10,140
With like the...

5077
03:14:10,660 --> 03:14:14,860
It's basically Team Rocket with the Rattatas and the Zubats.

5078
03:14:15,220 --> 03:14:17,700
This guy just has like three Zubats.

5079
03:14:19,360 --> 03:14:19,800
How?

5080
03:14:20,420 --> 03:14:21,680
Whoa, I wonder how.

5081
03:14:22,980 --> 03:14:24,340
Bro, is this trying to shoot me?

5082
03:14:24,900 --> 03:14:25,480
Alright, I swear.

5083
03:14:25,520 --> 03:14:27,640
If it's just bullet bill, I swear to god.

5084
03:14:29,900 --> 03:14:32,720
Mio, you're not gonna get hold of this bill blaster.

5085
03:14:38,360 --> 03:14:39,020
Okay, no.

5086
03:14:39,100 --> 03:14:40,220
Oh, it's a hornet.

5087
03:14:40,220 --> 03:14:42,220
Oh, it's a rat trooper.

5088
03:14:42,540 --> 03:14:44,120
The ant trooper's evolution.

5089
03:14:47,640 --> 03:14:48,280
Boom.

5090
03:14:50,280 --> 03:14:50,920
Goodbye.

5091
03:14:57,200 --> 03:14:58,180
Alright, nice.

5092
03:14:58,900 --> 03:14:59,900
Oh my god.

5093
03:15:00,240 --> 03:15:01,320
We're so close.

5094
03:15:02,220 --> 03:15:03,380
35 levels left.

5095
03:15:05,500 --> 03:15:06,340
Oh yeah.

5096
03:15:06,720 --> 03:15:08,420
He evolves and wears...

5097
03:15:08,420 --> 03:15:10,540
He evolves and wears a fucking hat.

5098
03:15:10,740 --> 03:15:11,780
That's just evolution.

5099
03:15:12,140 --> 03:15:13,520
He just finds a hat.

5100
03:15:16,080 --> 03:15:17,280
He's like, don't worry.

5101
03:15:17,400 --> 03:15:18,160
I'm different now.

5102
03:15:18,340 --> 03:15:19,180
I have a hat.

5103
03:15:23,690 --> 03:15:24,690
Alright, nice.

5104
03:15:27,530 --> 03:15:28,130
Goodbye.

5105
03:15:28,630 --> 03:15:29,530
Give me your money.

5106
03:15:30,610 --> 03:15:31,830
Is there anything here?

5107
03:15:39,610 --> 03:15:46,970
Is there anything here?

5108
03:15:47,550 --> 03:15:48,370
Alright, guys.

5109
03:15:48,570 --> 03:15:51,290
I think I'm gonna stop it here so I can rest my voice.

5110
03:15:51,490 --> 03:15:51,950
I've been...

5111
03:15:51,950 --> 03:15:53,350
There's been too many toads.

5112
03:15:55,010 --> 03:15:55,490
There's...

5113
03:15:55,490 --> 03:15:57,730
I think it's a good stopping point.

5114
03:15:57,870 --> 03:15:59,690
But I've been enjoying it so far.

5115
03:15:59,930 --> 03:16:02,190
I hope you guys have been enjoying watching, too.

5116
03:16:03,610 --> 03:16:04,850
Playing like a...

5117
03:16:04,850 --> 03:16:06,490
Sort of like a Pokemon game again.

5118
03:16:06,990 --> 03:16:09,170
Yeah, too much toad voice acting.

5119
03:16:09,350 --> 03:16:10,030
I need a rest.

5120
03:16:10,030 --> 03:16:12,350
I've been reading a lot this week, too.

5121
03:16:13,010 --> 03:16:15,970
Like, I had to read for yesterday's stream.

5122
03:16:16,250 --> 03:16:19,390
And then there was like some reading for other streams.

5123
03:16:19,610 --> 03:16:21,490
So I'm gonna rest my voice.

5124
03:16:22,870 --> 03:16:24,370
I'm gonna rest my voice today.

5125
03:16:24,450 --> 03:16:25,390
But it's been really fun.

5126
03:16:26,130 --> 03:16:29,490
Um, I've been enjoying the Super Mario mod.

5127
03:16:29,650 --> 03:16:31,030
And like seeing all the different designs.

5128
03:16:31,350 --> 03:16:32,850
And all the different mechanics and stuff.

5129
03:16:33,210 --> 03:16:36,070
And, um, you know, having you guys be part of the journey.

5130
03:16:36,270 --> 03:16:37,170
Being part of my team.

5131
03:16:37,170 --> 03:16:37,830
And everything.

5132
03:16:38,530 --> 03:16:38,850
Um.

5133
03:16:40,210 --> 03:16:40,490
Um.

5134
03:16:40,650 --> 03:16:41,270
But yeah, guys.

5135
03:16:41,270 --> 03:16:44,370
I hope you all enjoyed watching me today.

5136
03:16:44,550 --> 03:16:44,790
Wait.

5137
03:16:44,930 --> 03:16:45,590
Before I go.

5138
03:16:45,850 --> 03:16:46,570
What did you say?

5139
03:16:47,350 --> 03:16:48,550
What did Mehdi say?

5140
03:16:50,130 --> 03:16:51,110
I've been enjoying...

5141
03:16:51,110 --> 03:16:52,670
I think the long count paid off.

5142
03:16:52,830 --> 03:16:53,830
Put me in the next one.

5143
03:16:54,050 --> 03:16:54,370
Okay.

5144
03:17:00,430 --> 03:17:02,490
Mehdi, thank you for the super chat.

5145
03:17:02,690 --> 03:17:03,050
Thank you.

5146
03:17:03,230 --> 03:17:03,870
Thank you.

5147
03:17:07,310 --> 03:17:09,210
Where am I going back to?

5148
03:17:12,910 --> 03:17:13,350
Alright.

5149
03:17:13,450 --> 03:17:14,490
Before I end it.

5150
03:17:15,250 --> 03:17:15,730
Oh, look.

5151
03:17:15,850 --> 03:17:17,090
That's such a cute spiny.

5152
03:17:17,330 --> 03:17:17,530
Oh, you.

5153
03:17:17,790 --> 03:17:18,330
Oh, wow.

5154
03:17:20,150 --> 03:17:20,590
Wait.

5155
03:17:20,750 --> 03:17:21,870
Where is she going?

5156
03:17:24,790 --> 03:17:25,870
Hey, we're lucky.

5157
03:17:25,870 --> 03:17:27,210
It might be a shiny, too.

5158
03:17:31,170 --> 03:17:32,110
Oh, nope.

5159
03:17:32,310 --> 03:17:32,950
Not you.

5160
03:17:33,610 --> 03:17:34,390
Not you.

5161
03:17:35,230 --> 03:17:37,090
There's a long card, right?

5162
03:17:37,770 --> 03:17:38,370
Maybe.

5163
03:17:40,570 --> 03:17:41,650
Oh, man.

5164
03:17:42,770 --> 03:17:43,690
It'll be unfortunate.

5165
03:17:49,050 --> 03:17:49,990
Oh, there you go.

5166
03:17:50,190 --> 03:17:50,490
Perfect.

5167
03:17:54,590 --> 03:17:56,670
Oh, you thought I was going to run away.

5168
03:17:58,850 --> 03:18:00,190
Thank you for the super chat.

5169
03:18:00,350 --> 03:18:00,690
Thank you.

5170
03:18:00,850 --> 03:18:01,490
Thank you.

5171
03:18:02,510 --> 03:18:03,310
Let me...

5172
03:18:03,930 --> 03:18:04,730
You fool.

5173
03:18:08,230 --> 03:18:09,190
Oh, hey.

5174
03:18:09,350 --> 03:18:10,590
It's a male this time.

5175
03:18:14,550 --> 03:18:17,790
You get to be the only male fool.

5176
03:18:19,410 --> 03:18:20,810
Oh, boy.

5177
03:18:21,250 --> 03:18:21,970
Variety.

5178
03:18:25,650 --> 03:18:26,790
All right, nice.

5179
03:18:28,310 --> 03:18:30,370
You were so close.

5180
03:18:31,010 --> 03:18:33,310
That wasn't what I wish...

5181
03:18:33,310 --> 03:18:35,470
Genie, this is the monkey paw.

5182
03:18:35,950 --> 03:18:37,670
Thank you for the super chat.

5183
03:18:37,850 --> 03:18:38,210
Thank you.

5184
03:18:38,350 --> 03:18:38,690
Thank you.

5185
03:18:38,750 --> 03:18:39,230
It's okay.

5186
03:18:39,710 --> 03:18:41,510
Jagoon will die for the cause.

5187
03:18:43,830 --> 03:18:45,970
The monkey paw, girl.

5188
03:18:47,810 --> 03:18:49,330
All right, Maddie Goon.

5189
03:18:55,270 --> 03:18:56,930
All right, nice.

5190
03:18:57,330 --> 03:18:59,550
Eventually, I'll find a shiny fool, right?

5191
03:19:00,710 --> 03:19:02,070
Wait, okay.

5192
03:19:02,710 --> 03:19:05,190
The moment we get to a...

5193
03:19:05,190 --> 03:19:07,730
A daycare center, I'm going to put two.

5194
03:19:07,970 --> 03:19:08,670
I'm going to...

5195
03:19:08,670 --> 03:19:10,950
Is the fool like a ditto?

5196
03:19:15,170 --> 03:19:18,010
I'll just make an entire box of food.

5197
03:19:21,090 --> 03:19:21,910
All right.

5198
03:19:24,510 --> 03:19:25,550
There you go.

5199
03:19:28,010 --> 03:19:29,130
I'll start...

5200
03:19:29,130 --> 03:19:30,850
I'll start hatching, though.

5201
03:19:33,090 --> 03:19:33,650
I...

5202
03:19:34,610 --> 03:19:37,050
God, thank you for the super chat.

5203
03:19:37,210 --> 03:19:37,970
Thank you, thank you.

5204
03:19:38,270 --> 03:19:41,170
The irony is I want it to be a fool.

5205
03:19:42,810 --> 03:19:43,570
All right.

5206
03:19:45,430 --> 03:19:46,550
Okay, let's...

5207
03:19:46,550 --> 03:19:48,050
Oh, we have just enough.

5208
03:19:48,050 --> 03:19:49,210
All right.

5209
03:19:51,050 --> 03:19:52,730
Put him here.

5210
03:19:53,090 --> 03:19:54,510
And then we'll put...

5211
03:19:55,250 --> 03:19:56,150
You here.

5212
03:19:57,770 --> 03:19:59,530
And then we'll put...

5213
03:20:00,870 --> 03:20:01,570
Okay.

5214
03:20:02,010 --> 03:20:02,470
You here.

5215
03:20:02,870 --> 03:20:03,570
And...

5216
03:20:05,930 --> 03:20:07,150
Oh, we don't...

5217
03:20:07,150 --> 03:20:07,850
We need one more.

5218
03:20:08,130 --> 03:20:10,010
We need one more.

5219
03:20:10,010 --> 03:20:11,150
And then...

5220
03:20:13,410 --> 03:20:15,290
And then we'll...

5221
03:20:15,290 --> 03:20:16,470
Put beanie...

5222
03:20:20,290 --> 03:20:23,470
I think it's better if it's like here.

5223
03:20:23,950 --> 03:20:24,290
All right.

5224
03:20:25,730 --> 03:20:26,830
Wait, here we go.

5225
03:20:28,870 --> 03:20:29,570
All right.

5226
03:20:29,690 --> 03:20:30,330
This is better.

5227
03:20:30,790 --> 03:20:31,790
We just need one more.

5228
03:20:31,790 --> 03:20:33,130
And then we complete it.

5229
03:20:33,770 --> 03:20:34,250
And then we complete it.

5230
03:20:35,430 --> 03:20:36,850
We just need one more.

5231
03:20:37,090 --> 03:20:37,970
And then my...

5232
03:20:37,970 --> 03:20:39,490
The collection will be complete.

5233
03:20:41,970 --> 03:20:42,450
Uh...

5234
03:20:44,770 --> 03:20:45,610
There we go.

5235
03:20:45,950 --> 03:20:46,270
Wait.

5236
03:20:46,310 --> 03:20:47,990
Actually, it should be in the...

5237
03:20:47,990 --> 03:20:48,650
Yeah, there we go.

5238
03:20:48,870 --> 03:20:49,790
And then we'll have one more.

5239
03:20:49,890 --> 03:20:50,970
We'll catch one more here.

5240
03:20:51,830 --> 03:20:52,310
Well...

5241
03:20:56,610 --> 03:20:59,010
I mean, we can also do like this, too.

5242
03:20:59,910 --> 03:21:01,170
But we need like...

5243
03:21:01,170 --> 03:21:01,810
I want that...

5244
03:21:01,810 --> 03:21:03,570
We need like two more back here, though.

5245
03:21:04,370 --> 03:21:04,890
Um...

5246
03:21:04,890 --> 03:21:05,670
Actually, this is better.

5247
03:21:05,870 --> 03:21:06,970
Actually, this is actually better.

5248
03:21:07,410 --> 03:21:08,170
This is...

5249
03:21:08,170 --> 03:21:08,670
This is...

5250
03:21:15,100 --> 03:21:16,380
I like that.

5251
03:21:16,760 --> 03:21:17,400
All right.

5252
03:21:17,480 --> 03:21:17,740
Nice.

5253
03:21:19,340 --> 03:21:19,700
Nice.

5254
03:21:20,340 --> 03:21:21,520
Congratulations, Gus.

5255
03:21:21,820 --> 03:21:22,680
Yeah, you're a shot.

5256
03:21:22,880 --> 03:21:23,460
Oh, wait.

5257
03:21:23,640 --> 03:21:24,860
It's red, too.

5258
03:21:25,260 --> 03:21:25,640
Wait.

5259
03:21:26,700 --> 03:21:29,160
I forgot this is the red one.

5260
03:21:29,460 --> 03:21:30,440
Oh, my God.

5261
03:21:30,880 --> 03:21:31,140
Okay.

5262
03:21:31,560 --> 03:21:32,280
It's perfect.

5263
03:21:33,620 --> 03:21:34,260
No.

5264
03:21:37,500 --> 03:21:38,760
Oh, my God.

5265
03:21:39,420 --> 03:21:39,800
All right.

5266
03:21:40,180 --> 03:21:40,580
Nice.

5267
03:21:40,760 --> 03:21:42,300
I think that's a good way to end it here.

5268
03:21:42,660 --> 03:21:42,900
All right.

5269
03:21:43,120 --> 03:21:44,440
Through today's stream.

5270
03:21:45,400 --> 03:21:47,280
What is happening?

5271
03:21:50,880 --> 03:21:51,840
Hey, guys.

5272
03:21:52,180 --> 03:21:53,360
Have fun watching.

5273
03:21:53,580 --> 03:21:54,580
We have a lot of series.

5274
03:21:54,580 --> 03:21:55,520
We got it complete.

5275
03:21:55,540 --> 03:21:56,280
I just realized.

5276
03:21:56,800 --> 03:21:57,160
But...

5277
03:21:57,680 --> 03:21:59,840
I hope you guys have a lot of fun watching.

5278
03:22:00,140 --> 03:22:01,580
I will keep going with...

5279
03:22:01,580 --> 03:22:04,540
I will keep going with part two of this.

5280
03:22:05,040 --> 03:22:06,380
Gus, thank you for the super chat.

5281
03:22:06,500 --> 03:22:06,740
Thank you.

5282
03:22:06,840 --> 03:22:07,320
Thank you.

5283
03:22:07,560 --> 03:22:08,220
Thanks, boss.

5284
03:22:08,260 --> 03:22:09,400
My dream come true.

5285
03:22:10,820 --> 03:22:11,220
Man.

5286
03:22:13,540 --> 03:22:15,520
We need a lot of foos, guys.

5287
03:22:16,020 --> 03:22:17,400
Chicory, thank you for the super chat.

5288
03:22:17,460 --> 03:22:17,700
Thank you.

5289
03:22:17,820 --> 03:22:18,160
Thank you.

5290
03:22:18,280 --> 03:22:20,020
No, Chicorita here.

5291
03:22:20,240 --> 03:22:21,400
Thank you for the super chat.

5292
03:22:21,560 --> 03:22:21,840
Thank you.

5293
03:22:21,980 --> 03:22:22,380
Thank you.

5294
03:22:22,580 --> 03:22:23,720
As always, everybody.

5295
03:22:23,720 --> 03:22:28,340
Everybody, stay hydrated, pause your check, give them a round to get that blood flowed.

5296
03:22:28,440 --> 03:22:31,840
And if you step from me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

5297
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:33,400
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5298
03:22:33,800 --> 03:22:34,520
Bye, guys.

5299
03:22:34,940 --> 03:22:35,340
Bye!
