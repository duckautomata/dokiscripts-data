00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:17,380
Hello, hello, everybody, and welcome to Girls Frontline 2X.

6
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:42,120

9
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:55,120
for the free rewards, I believe you can get 34 free pulls if you're a returning player.

10
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,740
So their signing event has 10 pulls.

11
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,960
And there's like event resources that are like equivalent to like 24 pulls.

12
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:08,940
But if you are a new player, you get 120 pulls.

13
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,120
So yes, that is a lot of stuff you can get from that.

14
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:12,660
Yeah, I know.

15
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,500
I love free stuff.

16
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,860
We all love free stuff.

17
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:47,700
bunch of new things to look forward to or the you're too old to be playing with nobody is too old to be playing with dolls uh but there is a lot of stuff going in um with the new patch and uh i'm gonna see if i can go through all of it with you guys and i believe i think you guys already saw in the starting that uh there is a new doll her name is uh jan you uh who is a support doll and Apparently,

18
00:06:48,020 --> 00:07:01,660
she's built around, like, electricity, like, an electric team, and, uh, and there's also, like, a new skin for her, as well as, I believe there's, like, a new outfit, too.

19
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,160
Let me double-check real quick.

20
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,660
I don't want to be like, there's a new outfit!

21
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,920
There's, like, you're pointing me.

22
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,400
Oh, no, not new outfit.

23
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,420
Returning outfit.

24
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:16,820
So, you can, there's a returning outfit that you can, um, you can get, I believe.

25
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,080
Yeah, so there's a lot of new things to look forward to, and then there's a new event as well.

26
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,500
So I'm really excited to come back to the girls' front line, especially the dormitory.

27
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,160
I think we all had a fun time in the dorms.

28
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:45,820
So for those who don't know, there are, I think this event goes from until now to October 15th, I believe.

29
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,460
like, I was going to say, how many days is that?

30
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,300
Like half a month.

31
00:07:51,460 --> 00:08:00,560
You have like half a month to go to to get in on the new event, the new character, and all that stuff.

32
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,580
Yeah, so I'm very excited to try it all out.

33
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,680
I believe the event is called Intercise.

34
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,320
I can't pronounce.

35
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,740
I'm so bad at pronunciation.

36
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,180
Intercise of Reminiscence.

37
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,780
Okay, is that how you pronounce it?

38
00:08:17,040 --> 00:09:13,580

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,220
There's no way.

61
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,340
Six times the try.

62
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,720
Okay, as long as I get it within seven tries, I'll get it.

63

There she is.

67
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,090

68
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,130

00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,090

00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,070
Here you go.

156
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,570
You get whatever this gun is that apparently I have.

157
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,750
I, like, have my own little...

158
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,470
My own little gun harem right here.

159
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,990
Alright, you get the retired gun.

160
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,010
Alright, now I'll pull for your weapon.

161
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,470
But it doesn't mean you'll get it.

162
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,330
I'm pulling it so that I can look at it.

163
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,670
You have my own...

164
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,070
I actually have my own armor.

165
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,950
I'm only pulling for it so I can put it on as display.

166
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,810
She doesn't actually get it.

167
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,210
Yeah, I'm a distributor.

168
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,310
Oh, oh my god.

169
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,110
Whose gun is this?

170
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,630
All right, get out of here.

171
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:31,970
I want to pull...

172
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,350
I want her to hold this.

173
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,330
Is this like...

174
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,870
Is this locked to a character?

175
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,070
Yeah, that's it.

176
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,890
an armory is technically a gun harem.

177
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,870
It's just like, it's already like, oh, I want to give her that.

178
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,150
I think that one's silly.

179
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,250
No way, I kept more clothes.

180
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,670
Handgun users only.

181
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,110
Jenny, why can't you be a, why can't you be both?

182
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,490
Alright, this has to be it.

183
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,750
Oh my god, it is.

184
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,070
I was just coping.

185
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,090
Alright.

186
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,910
Retired model alpha.

187
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,350
Wait, that doesn't look like.

188
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,190
This doesn't look like Leaping Tiger.

189
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,770
What is this?

190
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,710
The Samosek.

191
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,650
What the heck is this?

192
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:23,090
This doesn't look like... This doesn't look like Leaping Tiger.

193
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,190
Where's the Tiger?

194
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:28,030
I fell the 75-25.

195
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,810
I used up all my luck.

196
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,910
I really did.

197
00:23:31,030 --> 00:24:14,650

00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,590
It's so bad.

203
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,870
Why is there a sword in my gun game?

I can't...

206
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:06,050
If you throw it, it's technically a gun.

207
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:06,870
Oh, you're right.

208
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,130

235
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,040

236
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,680
Like, what is she gonna do with money?

265
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,650
A dad with, like, so many children.

266
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,910

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,840
I like this.

327
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,800

00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,780
I like the panda is cute.

331
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,980
I think the panda is cuter than the red ribbon.

332
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,560
And then...

333
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,960
I'll buy this too.

334
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,620
I'm customizing my doll.

335
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,580
And then...

336
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,100
That's it.

337
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,820
I just wanted these two.

338
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,480
I don't need the whole thing.

339
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,060

00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,740
I was like, wait, I'm in her- I'm actually in her room?

447
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,200
I thought I was just role-playing.

00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,640

00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,160

You can't have your tummy get frostbred.

511
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,640
That's your best trade.

512
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,500
Now she cares.

513
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,100
Oh, is it here?

514
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,380
Oh, Nice.

515
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:18,500
Letter B.

516
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,440
I put through me a speed run.

517
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,320
Which one is it?

518
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,300
Oh, I can't.

519
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,460
I thought I could use this.

520
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,000
Do not use this to purchase.

521
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:39,740
No!

522
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,920
Now she'll never be my number one.

523
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,920
Wait, go back.

524
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,460
How will she be my number one?

525
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,560
Only through dailies.

526
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:57,580
No!

527
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:09,730
How will she be my number one if she doesn't love me?

528
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,890
Dorm shop.

529
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:13,510
Where's the dorm shop?

530
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,960
But this back shop?

531
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,200
So not here.

532
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:23,840
Oh, here.

533
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,200
Okay.

534
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,920
Oh, I have enough.

535
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,480
Alright, what does she like?

536

537
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,840
Wait, which one?

538
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:34,720
Which one?

539
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,560
Which is, which is like, I give her stuff and then she loves me more.

540
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,480
Which is the best one?

541
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:50,470
Do you even love her?

542
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:51,990
She's new.

543
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:53,710

547
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:13,800

548
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,000

00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:41,660
Oh.

554
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,480

00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,320
Hello?

556
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:48,680
Hello?

557
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,560
I think I'm not allowed to look at our memories.

558
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,100
I think she got mad that I forgot that we were married, guys.

559
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,460
I think...

560
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,940
I think she got mad.

561
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,960
She's like, you forgot our marriage already?

562
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,740
I'm sorry.

563
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,680
I'm so sorry.

564
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,940
I just needed a reminder.

565
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,320
I just needed to be reminded.

566
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,320
I'm so sorry.

567
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,280

570
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,860
And she's like, what's our anniversary?

571
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,620
I was like, look, I, oh man, I'm so tired.

572
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,820

574
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,960
You don't understand, baby.

I had a long day at work.

576
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,320
I think she got a little mad that I didn't remember.

577
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,680
But she doesn't know that I actually didn't remember.

578
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,560

599
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:11,170

00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:12,630

00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,980
Marriage is a process.

606
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,980
The divorce came out of nowhere.

607
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,580
How could you do this?

608
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,960

609
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,740

I task managered everything.

624
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:55,300
All right, let me try again.

625
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,100
End task.

626
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,570
That's right.

627

End task.

628
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,840
That's right.

629
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,060
It's her.

630
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,440
She changed the locks.

631
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:08,620
What?

632
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,340
She does not legally own.

633
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,120
I own the entire base.

634
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,960
Like, there's other girls there.

635
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,080
She can't do this.

636
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,820
Other girls live here, too.

637
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,000
Alright, run as I'm bringing admin powers in.

638
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,260
She got the keys to her house now.

639
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:32,840
Alright.

640
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,540
That's it.

641
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,860
Wait, I don't want to clear the game data.

642
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,840
Alright, resource integrity.

643
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,580
That's it.

644
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,540
I'm getting the big guns now.

645
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,440
I'm checking the resource integrity.

646
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,640
You can't lock me up forever.

647
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,740
You know what?

648
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:54,340
The moment I get back in, marriage, I'm filing for divorce.

649
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,760

678
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:36,940
It's too late.

679
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,840
It's 47 gigabytes.

680
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,620
She has no memory of today now.

681
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:49,850
Do not.

682
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:50,990
No, I did.

683
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:52,390
I verified it.

684
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:52,910
I did.

685
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:54,290
I did verify it.

686
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:55,810
But like, she's still locked.

687
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:57,510
She like changed the locks.

688
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:22,810
But yes, while we're here if you guys want to check out the game yourself and also have a very healthy relationship with your dolls please feel free to click on the link click to click on the link pinned in the chat and you too can have a very healthy relationship just like me and gluca just like mine

689
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,690
extremely healthy

690
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,040
Don't worry.

691
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,860
It was open.

692
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,020
It's an open relationship.

693
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,280
Like, why give me all these rings?

694
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:47,000
What's the point of having all these rings?

695
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:50,900
I'm just using what was given to me.

696
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,500
I have five rings.

697
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,680
It was already in my inventory chat.

698
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,020
It was a cheat.

699
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,340
No, that.

700
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:02,060
Why do I have five rings in my inventory?

701
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,320
What was I going to do with it?

702
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,180
They were the ones.

703
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:04,720
You know what?

704
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,420
They gave me five rings.

705
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,340
So what was I supposed to infer with that, guys?

706
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,920
It was not for storage, obviously.

707
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:23,030
I had a...

708
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:25,790
For five fingers, Stokey.

709
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:29,490
So you can put each ring on each finger.

710
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:32,610
Oh yeah, but anyway, yeah.

711
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:44,810
If you guys didn't know, didn't know, for the new people who are new here, You get 34 free posts for this new event and also, I believe, 120 posts if you are a new pillar.

712
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,270
And we all love free stuff.

713
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:47,250
Right, Kluke?

714
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:50,110
You love free stuff too, right, Klukei?

715
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:56,250
Klukei, I'm wearing divorce papers.

716
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:58,810
No, no, I'm divorcing her.

717
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:01,590
She's the one.

718
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:04,010
She's the one that locked me.

719
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:04,890
Who does that?

720
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:07,390
Do you wrong?

721
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:51,030

723
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:13,750
You're right.

724
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:18,410
No, like we're not supposed to remember everything.

725
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:26,790
Look at that.

726
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:27,970
That's shit.

727
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:29,350

728
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:30,590

729
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:31,170

Wow, so many people agreeing with me.

01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:36,550
See, it's not one guy.

734
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:38,810
I read at least three different people.

I don't know what she did.

757
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:14,070
Do I have to reboot?

01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:21,750

I have an idea.

768
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:50,340
If I delete all the data in this folder, then it should work.

769
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:52,660
Data.

770
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:53,840
That's right.

771
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,860
I delete your memory.

772
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,100
There we go.

773
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,800
All your memory gone now.

01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:40,300
All right, I restore everything back now.

777
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:41,960
It's a lot of items.

778
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,560
It's 4,000 items.

779
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,680
I'm restoring everything back.

780
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,140
And I replace these files.

781
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:52,580
Continue.

782
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:54,820
Okay, wait.

783
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:01,320
And then what I do, I close this.

784
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:11,460
And then it's moving 4,997 items back to the original folder.

785
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:16,460
And then, Girls Frontline.

786
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,540
And then, Run as Administer.

787
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:25,920
And then I click Start.

788
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:38,550
You just deleted your old save.

789
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:40,390
How is I supposed to know?

790
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:41,910
I was just trying to wipe her memory.

791
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:45,650
So I can redo this.

792
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:49,990
So like she wouldn't know.

793
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:51,970
Like she wouldn't know.

794
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:02,250
I thought I could just wipe her memory.

795
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:03,650
So like nothing.

796
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:05,190
I didn't do anything wrong.

797
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:11,980
I don't think that's how that works.

798
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:14,540
Okay.

799
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:16,200
Okay.

800
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,880
Guys, I might have to reboot my PC.

801
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:25,580
That might be the only option I have left.

802
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,560
I think she changed the locks.

803
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,900
I've tasked her memory is in the cloud.

804
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,320
Where is the cloud?

805
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,920
I gotta access it.

806
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:42,420
No, I actually, I, I task manager did like six times.

807
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:48,080
Kukai has taken everything that she took at my house.

808
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:51,160
She took my house and the dog.

809
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,260
Dad, no!

810
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:58,680
I'll be right back.

811
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,320
I have to reboot.

812
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:02,460
I have to reboot the PC.

813
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:06,340
And then maybe, maybe, maybe she'll forgive me.

814
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:07,900
I'll be right back, guys.

815
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,640
And my PC.

816
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,100
She took the PC too.

817
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:12,100
I'll be back.

818
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:13,320
I'm back.

819
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,020
It worked.

820
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,660

She'll take everything.

825
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:48,500
She'll take it all.

826
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:50,680
She has a really good lawyer.

827
01:14:50,880 --> 01:15:00,300
She said, please, please, don't leave me.

828
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:03,660
She's definitely got the better lawyer.

829
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:05,500
Don't leave me.

830
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:07,760
Please.

I don't have any more gifts.

841
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:31,880
I'm sorry.

842
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,920
Just don't break my PC again, please.

843
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:36,040
I'm sponsoring.

844
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:41,260
That's not for you now.

845
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:51,780
Alright, okay, so now that I know I've messed up and oh wait, I forgot you can oh, you forgot you could do that.

846
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,340
What's this?

847
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:55,040
Oh,

848
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:03,580
does she have like spots where I know that there's different animation depending on where you click, right?

849
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,080
Does she have that too?

850
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,740
Oh, she does.

851
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:16,300
Oh, it's so cute.

852
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:20,700
He's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

853
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:21,640
We're just friends.

854
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:23,400
We're just friends.

855
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:24,620
Don't tell.

856
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,380
Don't, don't, don't tell the cool guy.

857
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:27,620
Don't, I swear to God, please.

858
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:29,320
I need my PC right now.

859
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:30,540
Don't look, see, look.

860
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:31,660
I love you.

861
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:33,920
I love you.

862
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,460
I love my beautiful web.

863
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,780
We're just friends.

864
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:40,700
I love you.

865
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,180
You just go back.

866
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,020
All right.

867
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:48,580
All right.

868
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,020
Because I don't want to be on the...

869
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:53,140
I don't want to be locked out of my home anymore.

870
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:53,860
I'm scared.

871
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:55,080
I'll give you your gun.

872
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:56,260
Here you go.

873
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:58,220
Here you go.

874
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:00,940
I'll give you...

875
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:02,600
I don't want to be locked out.

876
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,680
I learned my lesson, Klu-Kat.

877
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:05,680
You're so right.

878
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:07,920
Everything you do, you're so...

879
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:08,980
You're so right.

880
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:11,520
Oh.

881
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:12,060
Oh, yeah.

882
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:12,680
It's the motorcycle.

883
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:13,060
cycle.

884
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:17,680
Don't believe it.

885
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:18,820
Yokey's a lot.

886
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:20,940
Don't worry, Cluka.

887
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,000
I never betray you.

888
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,260
Please take me back.

889
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,900
When was I looking the side?

890
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:31,440
Oh, she looks at me.

891
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:33,600
Can I click anywhere?

892
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,500
Oh, I can't.

893
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:39,600
Click Cluka on the left side?

894
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:40,800
Like here?

895
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,080
Is it that?

896
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:45,500
Like here?

897
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,640
I'm clicking her left side.

898
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,700
Or is this even about?

899
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:53,200
Oh.

900
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:56,660
Oh, she's like, come on.

901
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:58,040
On my invisible bike.

902
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,560
Oh, you're so smart, CluKat.

903
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:00,380
This is why.

904
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,080
Please don't divorce me.

905
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,000
I did.

906
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:08,260
I was clicking her left.

907
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:11,880
Or do I have to look at her left?

908
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,400
I guess we'll never know.

909
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:21,720
I love you, wife.

910
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:22,800
Here you go.

911
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:26,560
Thank you for taking me back.

912
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:28,600
I really appreciate it.

913
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,940
I promise I won't do it again.

914
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,360
I promise.

915
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,500
I promise I won't do it again.

916
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,160
I'm sorry.

917
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,100
You're so right.

918
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,380
All right, let's go look at the new stuff.

919
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:42,760
Oh, front lines.

920
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,660
All right, front line survivors.

921
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,500
Okay, so this is a new event.

922
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:48,940
Oh, are these all the...

923
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:49,620
Are these all the...

924
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:52,700
Uh...

925
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:53,620
Um, the mini...

926
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:55,020
The new mini games?

927
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,360
Just some mine.

928
01:18:58,460 --> 01:18:59,320
Wait, I'm sorry.

929
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,180
I'll probably...

930
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:01,660
I'll never do it again.

931
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:02,660
You're so right.

932
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:03,500
What is this?

933
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:06,000
Oh my god, there's a jump platform!

934
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:07,660
Wait.

935
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,200
We...

936
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:14,720
Oh my god, this is like throwback right now.

937
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:16,060
It's like classic.

938
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:17,460
Uh...

939
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,900
Like, to, like, classic games you play on your phone.

940
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,440
What's the highest score, though?

941
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:27,040
Wait, what's the...

942
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,760
Oh, I assume that's bad.

943
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:33,560
Yeah, this is, like, throwback for me.

944
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:36,260
Wee!

945
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:38,260
Wee!

946
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:39,400
Super jump!

947
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:41,580
It is so easy.

948
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,400
I'm so good.

949
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:42,600
Oh!

950
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:43,620
Oh!

951
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:44,980
Oh!

952
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:45,720
Oh!

953
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:46,560
Oh!

954
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:48,520
This is so easy.

955
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:49,980
Wait, I'm so good at this.

956
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:55,960
I think it's just from all the experience growing up playing these games.

957
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:00,760
Alright, uh...

958
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,720
See, look at this is what I do in my free time.

959
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:03,560
Nothing else.

960
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,280
All I do is play this jumpy game.

961
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,960
See, whenever I'm, like, not at home, this is what I'm doing.

962
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,100
You guys can...

963
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,000
See, look, see, chat can vouch for me.

964
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:16,060
I have VOD proof.

965
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:52,540

966
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:55,900
I thought that's what it does.

967
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:58,480
I was like, I'm going to stand right in front of it.

968
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:03,400
So the shield, the shield would like guard me from it.

969
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:05,060
Okay, front line survivors.

970
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:11,280
In front line survivors, the doll fires automatically while the commander controls the doll's movement and determines where to aim.

971
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,720
Oh wait, is this roguelike?

972
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:15,060
Alright, Sabrina.

973
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:18,740
as well user.

974
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:23,860
Hey, why would I ever use... Wait, no, Sabrina has S damage.

975
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,920
S damage equals good.

976
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:28,220
Alright.

977
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,180
Is this Roguelike Survivor?

978
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,580
How do I use...

979
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:34,020
Oh, is this just my crosshair?

980
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,320
Oh, it is Roguelike.

981
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:40,020
Oh, no.

982
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,140
Oh, no.

983
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:43,080
Oh, no, they know.

984
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,320
My one weakness.

985
01:21:47,800 --> 01:22:18,180
repulsion field I will do buckshot I feel like that's like more damage oh no they know they know meal preparation all enemies have 20% chance of dropping food what is it depending on food she should have food each food also increases okay you're not getting your hitbox radius increase you're not because I refuse to let you be to let you destroy your like this,

986
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:18,580
Sabrina.

987
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:25,700
What if your belly pucks out of cover and you get shot?

988
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,260
You're not gonna become bigger.

989
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:38,700
It's, look, it says food will also increase Sabrina's hitbox radius by 0.1%.

990
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:41,240
But she's hungry.

991
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,800
She won't be hungry if she gets shot.

992
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:47,060
Okay.

993
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:48,980
More damage.

994
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:51,120
Oh, man.

995
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:56,920
I think, like, what's a little bit difficult is the fact that there is...

996
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:57,740
Oh, my God, I got hit.

997
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,180
I see.

998
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,740
This is what happens.

999
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,840
Imagine if she had even more.

1000
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,420
More hitbox.

1001
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:09,480
No win, no eat.

1002
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:10,960
Oh, my God.

1003
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:11,360
I got hit.

1004
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:11,980
That's it.

1005
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:14,840
I'm just...

1006
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,380
All right, we try again.

1007
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:32,260
I accidentally ran into that's it you might you just die I guess I'm sending you into the gulags uh buckshot that's like two bullets

1008
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:51,640
the speedrun all right fine fine fine um we'll let her eat I'll guess I'll let her have like a salad Guys, I'm just doing it for her.

1009
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,340
I don't want her to get shot.

1010
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,100
My fire rate's always good.

1011
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,040
I wonder how it...

1012
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,040
Does she just get bigger on my screen?

1013
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:03,860
Is that it?

1014
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:05,720
She needs her pizza.

1015
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:07,520
Give her her pizza!

1016
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:09,740
Alright, there you go.

1017
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,640
Fine, I'll do her a special.

1018
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:14,140
She's so hungry, Doki.

1019
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:15,460
You want her to...

1020
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:16,540
Yes, yes, I do.

1021
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:17,380
I do.

1022
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,440
Whoever programmed her to have taste buds.

1023
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:22,900
Like, how could you do this to me?

1024
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,780
All you can eat.

1025
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,500
When a boss is defeated, Sabira receives a bonus to regular...

1026
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,660
You know...

1027
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:34,080
You know?

1028
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,800
Just let her eat.

1029
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:38,100
She's just gonna nut.

1030
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:39,220
We're just gonna feed her.

1031
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:40,940
We're just gonna keep feeding her.

1032
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,180
Eat that cake.

1033
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,160

1037
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:02,720
Why did you eat?

1038
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,340
I let you eat and you...

1039
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:05,700
It said you would give me food.

1040
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:06,880
It said you would...

1041
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:07,120
Okay.

1042
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:08,600
Yeah, there we go.

1043
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:09,640
We need this.

1044
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:11,500
Oh my god.

1045
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:12,440
We already...

1046
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:13,120
Oh my god.

1047
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:14,320
There's so many people with guns now.

1048
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:15,760
This is bad.

1049
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:17,780
Okay.

1050
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,060
Okay, the gun is scary.

1051
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,160
Oh, and there's a pig.

1052
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:21,660
Don't worry.

1053
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:22,800
We know what to do with that pig.

1054
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:23,500
We eat it.

1055
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:25,920
Oh,

1056
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,540
okay, we gotta go down, we gotta go down.

1057
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,360
Oh my god, is it 240 seconds yet?

1058
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,220
Oh my god, they're coming to me.

1059
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:44,180
The bullets.

1060
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,000
Oh, there's so much XP over there and I can't even get it.

1061
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:56,720
Okay, uh...

1062
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:03,320
Okay, I think I'm gonna keep my movement speed.

1063
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:10,960
Oh my god, they're all coming in Please, I just need another heart I just need another heart, please

1064
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:32,430
As long as the bullet guys don't get close to me Okay, that's fine I'm eating up all the Yum yum yum yum yum Yum yum yum Please Is it not 240 seconds yet?

1065
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:41,350
Okay, there you go We're just, we're grabbing another HP here I don't trust myself Oh my god, there's so many bullets.

1066
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:46,950
Here we go.

1067
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:50,830
Uh, pirate.

1068
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:54,890
Uh.

1069
01:27:58,910 --> 01:27:59,810
Bullet damage.

1070
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:01,090
All in.

1071
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:03,230
I don't even know what I'm...

1072
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:05,210
I don't know if I'm upgrading the right thing right now.

1073
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:08,850
As long as they don't shoot me.

1074
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,100
Oh, please give me another heart.

1075
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:16,520
Please, I need another heart.

1076
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:18,560
Oh, please.

1077
01:28:22,410 --> 01:28:22,750
Okay.

1078
01:28:23,710 --> 01:28:24,150
We're okay.

1079
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:24,710
We're okay.

1080
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:25,790
Oh, large enemy wave.

1081
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:26,130
Oh, wait.

1082
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:27,530
Look at all this XP, though.

1083
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:28,610
Yum, yum, yum.

1084
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:37,980
I feel like maybe dexterity is so I can be a little faster.

1085
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:42,040
As long as they don't shoot me, I'm fine.

1086
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:44,160
Like, the walking ones are, like, so easy.

1087
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:45,420
Oh, my God, they're coming.

1088
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,020
a big boy.

1089
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,880
I assume... Oh, he's dead.

1090
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,300
It's that easy.

1091
01:28:53,820 --> 01:29:01,220
Every 45 seconds, movement speed is reduced by 50%, then creates a tidal fortress within a medium radius?

1092
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:02,440
Oh.

1093
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:04,080
Oh, okay, wait.

1094
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:04,380
Sorry.

1095
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:05,880
My meal prep is ready.

1096
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:07,940
Um.

1097
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:10,880
Please.

1098
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,540
Oh, sorry.

1099
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,700
My meal is...

01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:55,390

1101
01:29:59,690 --> 01:30:01,130
It's a lie.

1102
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:05,310
Tidal wave, not good.

1103
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:07,590
I was so slow.

1104
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:09,630
I was not ready to be that slow.

1105
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:13,890
Emilia absorbs all drops.

1106
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:14,990
This effect is triggered.

1107
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:15,870
Hit bot radius.

1108
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:16,550
Alright, there you go.

1109
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:17,330
Balanced nutrition.

1110
01:30:17,490 --> 01:30:17,950
There we go.

1111
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:19,750
We're starting to eat salads now.

1112
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:20,730
Thank God.

1113
01:30:21,070 --> 01:30:21,730
Thank God.

1114
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:23,110
She's healthy now.

1115
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:24,330
Thank God.

1116
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:26,390
We're on a diet.

1117
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:29,330
Supreme.

1118
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:31,210
Dorito's on a diet now.

1119
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:34,410
There we go.

1120
01:30:37,490 --> 01:30:39,190
Because she's unhappy.

1121
01:30:39,790 --> 01:30:43,250
Well, it's not my fault that she had to go on a diet.

1122
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:46,930
We'll get more bullet damage.

1123
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:50,150
I feel like I'm so strong right now, so I don't really...

1124
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:51,570
I'll just go all in and damage.

1125
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:53,910
Because it's just kiting at this point.

1126
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:56,950
Oh my gosh.

1127
01:30:57,470 --> 01:30:58,230
Oh my, thank God.

1128
01:30:58,330 --> 01:30:58,490
Okay.

1129
01:31:04,910 --> 01:31:07,870
So I had to, I had to let the person in.

1130
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:14,650
Okay, we got, okay, we can, we can make, we'll make our, we'll make our entrance.

1131
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:15,450
There we go.

1132
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:16,610
That's, thank God.

1133
01:31:16,630 --> 01:31:21,250
I was a little scared because I thought he was gonna, she never would.

1134
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:22,590
Well, it's not my fault.

1135
01:31:22,650 --> 01:31:23,810
She got shot in the stomach.

1136
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:28,930
Like her belly poked out, so we had to put on, she, oh my God, it's literally all salads now.

1137
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:31,670
It's all, it actually is all salads.

1138
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:35,790
It's not my fault.

1139
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:39,150
Her stomach poked out of cover and we realized there was a problem.

1140
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:41,570
Shit.

1141
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:43,210
Oh my god.

1142
01:31:43,390 --> 01:31:43,890
Oops, I got hit.

1143
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:45,450
I was looking at chat.

1144
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:49,930
I'm doing it for her own good.

1145
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:51,830
She's so...

1146
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:53,650
Let her have her bring her.

1147
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:55,890
She's so sad.

1148
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:58,490
And doing it is for her going good.

1149
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:00,890
Okay, nice.

1150
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:01,910
Oh, I got hit there.

1151
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:34,570

1152
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:35,670
here you go.

1153
01:32:38,670 --> 01:32:40,370
Oh my god, this guy is so strong.

1154
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:43,250
Okay, can I actually...

1155
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:43,490
Nice.

1156
01:32:44,710 --> 01:32:45,370
Okay, that's easy.

1157
01:32:45,770 --> 01:32:47,110
Oh, there's so many of them now.

1158
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:48,830
You all have guns now.

1159
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:51,470
Bring your bullet damage.

1160
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:55,570
Knock back all in a mile every bullet count plus three.

1161
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:56,530
There you go.

1162
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:57,670
Let's get more bullets.

1163
01:32:58,150 --> 01:32:59,050
So it's more range.

1164
01:32:59,570 --> 01:33:00,870
Yeah, now I can kill more people.

1165
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:02,170
There you go.

1166
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:05,330
I want to make sure that I have an escape here.

1167
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:07,050
Go slow.

1168
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:08,730
Like, I'm like, I thought it...

1169
01:33:08,730 --> 01:33:09,270
I thought...

1170
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:10,990
Okay, clearly you guys all know I don't read.

1171
01:33:11,190 --> 01:33:12,890
But like, it sounded so cool.

1172
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:14,570
It had like, oh my god, there's dogs now.

1173
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:16,510
I don't know what this does.

1174
01:33:16,850 --> 01:33:17,850
I don't...

1175
01:33:19,830 --> 01:33:21,910
The description was so long!

1176
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:23,810
I thought it did something!

1177
01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:25,530
The description...

1178
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:26,910
You don't understand!

1179
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:29,250
The description was so long!

1180
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:32,190
Okay.

1181
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:35,330
All right.

1182
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:38,590
I want to grab all of this real fast.

1183
01:33:41,130 --> 01:33:42,150
I don't know.

1184
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:45,370
Why am I so slow with it?

1185
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:46,490
Okay.

1186
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:50,990
For every 100 steaming burger, attack is increased.

1187
01:33:51,410 --> 01:33:51,650
Nice.

1188
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:53,110
More attack.

1189
01:33:53,950 --> 01:33:54,450
Enough said.

1190
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:55,130
Say no more.

1191
01:33:55,670 --> 01:34:00,410
I heard more attack and that's all I cared.

1192
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:02,530
But I'm pretty good at this game.

1193
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:17,770

1195
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:40,310
The stadium is so big.

1196
01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:42,830
I've been, like, in this one area.

1197
01:34:43,050 --> 01:34:46,290
Congested in this one area for, like, 20 years.

1198
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:49,930
What do you arrange?

1199
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:51,990
So I can just walk around, like, this more.

1200
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:53,030
Oh, hey, it's the pig.

1201
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:53,830
The pig's back.

1202
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:57,070
Oh, wait, I got hit?

1203
01:34:57,190 --> 01:34:57,770
By who?

1204
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:01,490
Yeah, I was like, wait, there's more to this?

1205
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:03,390
Wait, maybe I can...

1206
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:04,770
and be greedy a little.

1207
01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:07,490
There you go.

1208
01:35:09,150 --> 01:35:10,190
More range.

1209
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:12,350
So I can just run away.

1210
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:12,870
Woo.

1211
01:35:13,230 --> 01:35:13,570
Woo.

1212
01:35:15,950 --> 01:35:18,550
I wonder if 4 HP is like the biggest.

1213
01:35:20,910 --> 01:35:21,470
There you go.

1214
01:35:24,570 --> 01:35:25,690
Wait, I'm so strong.

1215
01:35:25,870 --> 01:35:29,070
I can literally just be like, do like this and be like, suppressing fire.

1216
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:30,630
Oh my gosh, I got hit.

1217
01:35:30,930 --> 01:35:31,210
Never mind.

1218
01:35:31,710 --> 01:35:32,790
Don't stand still.

1219
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:37,070
I don't know if you guys notice, but standing still is a very bad idea in this game.

1220
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:38,390
There you go.

1221
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:39,290
I have knockback, though.

1222
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:39,830
Thank God.

1223
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:43,590
Am I maxed?

1224
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:44,090
No, I'm not.

1225
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:46,470
Okay, that's fine.

1226
01:35:48,730 --> 01:35:49,810
I gotta grab some burgers.

1227
01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:51,390
We can max this out, actually.

1228
01:35:52,230 --> 01:35:57,950
I don't know if, like, I feel like damage will only be good against the boss fight, because I one-shot all of these guys in general.

1229
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:02,870
Yeah, I, like, one-shot all of them.

1230
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:06,290
I just need, like, more bullets so I can kill more people.

1231
01:36:08,170 --> 01:36:08,590
Yeah.

1232
01:36:11,010 --> 01:36:12,070
Just grabbing me.

1233
01:36:12,110 --> 01:36:12,810
Okay, now I'm greedy.

1234
01:36:12,990 --> 01:36:13,550
I'm too greedy.

1235
01:36:13,710 --> 01:36:14,190
I'm too greedy.

1236
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:19,490
Wait until the bunnies show up.

1237
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:20,590
There's bunnies?

1238
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:24,590
Oh, I won.

1239
01:36:26,890 --> 01:36:27,370
Yay!

1240
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:31,870
Oh, the game was like, you did it.

1241
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:39,310
Oh, so you have to survive to, like, 10 minutes.

1242
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:40,890
I see.

1243
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:46,010
And early level is maximum 10 minutes.

1244
01:36:46,670 --> 01:36:46,690
Oh!

1245
01:36:48,830 --> 01:36:51,490
So I just have to survive to 10 minutes.

1246
01:36:52,450 --> 01:36:52,750
Let's see.

1247
01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:53,050
Normal.

1248
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:53,590
Oh, wait.

1249
01:36:53,690 --> 01:36:53,970
Normal?

1250
01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:55,110
That was normal?

1251
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:56,590
Wait, in hands.

1252
01:36:56,710 --> 01:36:57,310
Oh, my God.

1253
01:36:58,310 --> 01:36:58,650
Okay.

1254
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:00,370
Basic attack.

1255
01:37:02,670 --> 01:37:03,270
Oh.

1256
01:37:03,410 --> 01:37:04,070
I don't have enough.

1257
01:37:04,230 --> 01:37:05,610
Wait, that was normal?

1258
01:37:07,290 --> 01:37:08,450
Reward, what do I get?

1259
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:10,170
First try.

1260
01:37:11,410 --> 01:37:12,550
Okay, wait, we gotta do this again.

1261
01:37:13,110 --> 01:37:13,470
I'm sorry.

1262
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:17,310
We gotta, I wanna unlock hard.

1263
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:18,390
Okay, Endorus.

1264
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:23,070
Okay, what does she do?

1265
01:37:23,930 --> 01:37:25,310
What is her, oh, I feel so weak.

1266
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:31,230
What is her special power?

1267
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:37,320
Let me fire it.

1268
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:39,240
She's so weak right now.

1269
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:41,280
Alright.

1270
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,080
I want to see how hard hard it is.

1271
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,200
I just walked into him.

1272
01:37:45,820 --> 01:37:46,840
Let's grab the HP.

1273
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:50,800
We gotta grab the HP early on.

1274
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:52,800
I was like, let's see how hard this is.

1275
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:54,100
And I walked into him.

1276
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,180
Oh my god.

1277
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:57,260
I missed the two bullets.

1278
01:37:57,660 --> 01:37:59,000
I need more than one bullet though.

1279
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:01,600
There we go.

1280
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:05,460
Bullet.

1281
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:08,820
size too.

1282
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:09,700
Okay, nice.

1283
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,180
Nope, it's still, never mind, it's still one bullet.

1284
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,640
Oh my god, I missed her two bullets now.

1285
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:16,620
I missed Sabrina's two bullets.

1286
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,580
Her damage was S.

1287
01:38:20,620 --> 01:38:21,800
By the red upgrade?

1288
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:23,640
Okay.

1289
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:28,660
We're just going to lead them away so I can grab the upgrades.

1290
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:29,280
This one.

1291
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:35,680
Oh, is that, that's her special, right?

1292
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:46,420
You might want to spec her red upgrades immediately okay so that's her special all right that's i understand now

1293
01:38:51,500 --> 01:39:47,380
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh i missed the two bullets I think she's out Oh she's ranged Never mind I forgot Sabrina I forgot Not Sabrina I thought she was a sniper Oh my gosh She's so weak Why are you so weak We need more damage We absolutely need more damage Yeah Her Beginning is rough I don't like it She does so little Like I did five shots Sabrina was like three I can't miss her I miss Sabrina She have all the food In the world world i miss it i didn't know how good i had it until it was god and let's grab the xp

1295
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:09,060
yeah sabrina was was like i didn't know how good she was until it was god

1296
01:40:14,390 --> 01:40:15,830
Sabrina was so strong.

1297
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:17,130
She was actually so OP.

1298
01:40:18,070 --> 01:40:21,190
Like, I feel like it takes me 20 years to kill one person.

1299
01:40:22,510 --> 01:40:24,170
I'll grab the boss first.

1300
01:40:28,030 --> 01:40:31,210
Okay, I'll stack all her normal stuff first.

1301
01:40:31,390 --> 01:40:32,990
And then go... I need to get damage.

1302
01:40:33,530 --> 01:40:35,530
It takes me forever to kill these guys.

1303
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:44,740
Oh my gosh.

1304
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:45,680
This takes forever.

1305
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:47,780
Uh...

1306
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:49,860
Yeah, bullet... Wait, what's this?

1307
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:51,160
Regular bullet damage?

1308
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:52,620
Yeah.

1309
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:55,380
No, she needs... She needs more damage.

1310
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,740
Okay, now I one-shot them.

1311
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:58,360
Thank God.

1312
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:00,720
I was gonna say...

1313
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:02,080
Feels like it's gonna take me forever.

1314
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:03,300
It's fine.

1315
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:04,460
I didn't need that shield.

1316
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,520
Yeah, and more damage and more attack speed, I think, for her build.

1317
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:12,520
Oh, my God.

1318
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:13,100
They know.

1319
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:15,280
Oh, my God.

1320
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:16,180
They know...

1321
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:17,500
They know what gets me...

1322
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:19,200
survivors.

1323
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:22,160
Tell Krookai, this is what I've been doing.

1324
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:25,380
I have boss, Krookai.

1325
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:28,660
I've been, I swear, this is all I've been doing.

1326
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:31,240
I've just been playing rogue like survivors.

1327
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,480
Don't you understand?

1328
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:42,640
I swear, this is why I came home late.

1329
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:43,920
I have boss.

1330
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:47,200
Please don't knock me out.

1331
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:48,400
This is why I was late to this.

1332
01:41:48,420 --> 01:42:02,200
because I got I was just I was playing a run like surviving oh my god I messed up I didn't see the minus 5 fire rate okay we need an upward fire rate now

1333
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:51,100
shit oh yeah I fixed your fire rate because I selected the wrong thing I have a problem they're just so addicting I just like I just like seeing myself survive and then making different builds uh movement speed where's fire right oh here you go all right there you go and then we'll we'll fix it with damage later I don't even think she's good late game only because like only because like she does she Doesn't...

1334
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:53,380
I was mowing people down with Sabrina.

1335
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:57,960
At least it's not...

1336
01:42:57,960 --> 01:42:59,760
At least I'm not missing our anniversary dinner.

1337
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:01,200
Which I still need to figure.

1338
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:02,060
I'm too...

1339
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:05,400
I'm too scared to click on the recollection thing.

1340
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,820
I'm too scared to click on it.

1341
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:14,500
Okay, range.

1342
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:20,060
I'm worried KlupeCat is going to get mad at me again.

1343
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,960
And she'll be like, you forgot.

1344
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:23,920
I thought you said you remember our anniversary.

1345
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:24,480
It's like, I do.

1346
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,080
Of course, baby.

1347
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:26,040
Of course I do, darling.

1348
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,560
I was just... It was just...

1349
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:30,240
Miss click.

1350
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:35,940
Nice.

1351
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:41,340
I need my shield soon.

1352
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:46,220
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

1353
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:48,920
Alright.

1354
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:51,500
Oh, nice.

1355
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:52,600
Oh, no, not nice.

1356
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:53,800
I thought that was my shield.

1357
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:13,220
I'll get bullet damage only because like I don't know I feel like I'm not mowing them down fast enough Am I one-shotting them I think I am no I'm not I am absolutely nope I need more damage I am Oh my god Sabrina would have wiped these guys instantly

1358
01:44:17,590 --> 01:44:28,870
I don't know if yellow is good for this game I think it's just like different sets Oh my god I need damage though Yeah, like, Sabrina...

1359
01:44:28,870 --> 01:44:31,090
Like, I'm not even one-shotting these guys.

1360
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:33,130
Sabrina was one-shotting him.

1361
01:44:35,130 --> 01:44:36,590
Or maybe it's because I'm playing normal.

1362
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:38,650
Wait, I forgot.

1363
01:44:38,770 --> 01:44:41,030
Wait, I did change the difficulty, though.

1364
01:44:41,390 --> 01:44:42,590
Maybe that's it.

1365
01:44:42,990 --> 01:44:44,930
Maybe it's because, like, they're...

1366
01:44:45,510 --> 01:44:49,650
They might be more tanky, because maybe I'm not playing on easy mode anymore.

1367
01:44:51,870 --> 01:44:53,790
That would make sense.

1368
01:44:56,790 --> 01:45:02,050
oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no okay I might have to go back to Sabrina

1369
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:30,140

1370
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:32,080

1371
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:32,780
Okay, nice.

1372
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:34,920
A lot of XP here.

1373
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:35,800
Oh, no!

1374
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:39,620
No, okay.

1375
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:40,860
I'm grabbing Sabrina.

1376
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:42,920
Surrender.

1377
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:46,040
I'm grabbing Sabrina.

1378
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:50,300
I think Sabrina was the best for this.

1379
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:52,000
Normal.

1380
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:52,380
Oh, wait.

1381
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:53,180

Wait, how do I...

1383
01:45:58,560 --> 01:45:58,720
Wait.

Alright.

1385
01:46:05,730 --> 01:46:07,590
Alright, how tanky are they?

1386
01:46:08,830 --> 01:46:09,450
Not that bad.

1387
01:46:14,330 --> 01:46:18,490
Uh, long range, repulse by bullet size.

1388
01:46:20,350 --> 01:46:22,230
I want to make my shotgun a sniper shotgun.

1389
01:46:24,470 --> 01:46:29,070
Okay, they take two shots, so like, it's not that bad.

1390
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:30,510
Alright, it's time to eat.

1391
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:32,550
It's eating time.

1392
01:46:34,330 --> 01:46:35,270
Let her eat!

1394
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:17,860
All the food went to her side.

1395
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:19,280
She got it.

1396
01:47:28,580 --> 01:47:30,560
Nom, yom, yom, yom.

It's okay.

God, I don't do anything.

1400
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:39,920
I think I gotta keep eating.

1401
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,200

01:49:41,970 --> 01:49:44,830
Let's make ourselves a little pathway first.

1410
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:50,660
Wait, why is he just standing there?

1411
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:52,280
Is he okay?

1412
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:53,660
He's just sitting there.

1413
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:56,460
That's a boss fight?

1414
01:49:57,020 --> 01:49:58,920
Oh, he just makes it a little darker.

1415
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:00,720
I was like, where are you doing here?

1416
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:01,880
Let's move.

1417
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:07,250
Okay, I want to be a little...

1418
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:07,770
faster.

1419
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:11,490
He's just standing there messingly.

1420
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:12,550
Yeah, I was like, move.

1421
01:50:13,290 --> 01:50:14,430
You're in the way.

1422
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:17,830
I want to grab another heal.

1423
01:50:18,730 --> 01:50:22,890
Om yom, yom, Got to eat my sandwich.

1424
01:50:23,990 --> 01:50:24,970
Om, yom, yom, yom.

01:50:25,130 --> 01:50:25,710
Oh, there it is.

1426
01:50:25,790 --> 01:50:26,510
Splash ammo.

1427
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:28,190
There it is.

1428
01:50:28,270 --> 01:50:28,810
This is what I wanted.

1429
01:50:29,310 --> 01:50:30,150
Oh, it wasn't this.

1430
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:31,150
Oh, is it?

1431
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:31,790
Oh, there it is.

1432
01:50:31,830 --> 01:50:32,730
Yeah, I got it.

1433
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:35,950
This is the OP.

1434
01:50:36,450 --> 01:50:37,250
The OP build.

1435
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:42,030
Oh my god, almost got shot at I got a little worry

1436
01:50:45,450 --> 01:51:53,050
There we go Yeah, that boss fight was very Underwhelming, I was like, that's it You just stood there You just stood there and let me get shot I don't think he wanted I think he gave up He gave up before we even started the fight Yeah Alright, I'm one-shotting everything So that I don't think I need damage yet Okay yeah whoever the other girl was I'm just one-shotting things now all right I'll grab this one just to be sure yeah he just gave up oh my god the bunnies oh the bunnies okay I know all right there they are that's I only win the bunnies nope there they are I still one-shot them so it's nice I just I am a a bit uncomfortable oh my god i'm so oh my god we need to get the salad upgrade we need the salad upgrade so badly you're so fast

1437
01:51:56,620 --> 01:52:17,680

1438
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,320
Like, Andorris, like, like, like, look at how much I could do.

1439
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:27,180
Compared to, like, compared to Andorris.

1440
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:28,080
I literally one shot.

1441
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:31,180
Andorris took me, like, five shots to kill one thing.

1442
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:32,640
Like, be better.

1443
01:52:35,780 --> 01:52:36,340
That's fine.

1444
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:38,380
I do so much damage that I'm not too worried.

1445
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:43,500
Like, the bunnies, they may be fast, but, like, I have 2 million enemies in front of me.

1446
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:45,440
So they got a stand in line.

1447
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:48,640
Yeah, queue up if you want to kill me.

1448
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:51,200
And number one is Klu-Kai.

1449
01:52:54,740 --> 01:52:59,060
Yeah, get behind Klu-Kai if you want to stab me.

1450
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:03,640
Oh, nice.

1451
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:04,420
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

1452
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:07,480
Bullet count.

1453
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:10,200
Okay, more bullets.

1454
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:12,480
That's good.

1455
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:15,500
That's good, like, it'll knock back, too.

1456
01:53:20,150 --> 01:53:20,830
Oh my god.

1457
01:53:21,150 --> 01:53:21,530
Oh my god.

1458
01:53:21,650 --> 01:53:21,930
Oh my god.

1459
01:53:22,010 --> 01:53:23,110
Where did he come from?

1460
01:53:23,690 --> 01:53:24,890
That was a drive-by.

1461
01:53:26,730 --> 01:53:28,190
Where did this bunny come from?

1462
01:53:28,590 --> 01:53:29,330
Oh, there's so many.

1463
01:53:29,590 --> 01:53:30,610
What happened to my barrier?

1464
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:32,350
What happened to my bunny barrier?

1465
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:37,740
Okay.

1466
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:39,300
It's okay.

1467
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:40,660
We're okay.

1468
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:44,020
We're surviving.

1469
01:53:47,540 --> 01:53:48,060
There you go.

1470
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:51,800
I was like, how did it get?

1471
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:52,760
past them.

1472
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:54,860
You have sadly cut the line.

1473
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:57,860
I have a long list of enemies.

1474
01:53:58,560 --> 01:53:59,900
How did they cut the line?

1475
01:54:04,110 --> 01:54:05,310
Okay, oh, there's the title.

1476
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:06,290
Okay, this one.

1477
01:54:06,610 --> 01:54:11,210
Every 45 seconds, movement speed is reduced by 50%.

1478
01:54:11,210 --> 01:54:17,950
Then creates a tidal wave fortress within a medium race that compels all enemies who are damp from entering.

1479
01:54:18,230 --> 01:54:19,830
Interrupts enemies with damp from charging.

1480
01:54:20,010 --> 01:54:22,530
All the subria are replaced by... Okay, you know what?

1481
01:54:22,570 --> 01:54:23,310
Let's try it again.

1482
01:54:24,110 --> 01:54:27,450
Oh, there we go.

1483
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:28,110
Okay, yeah.

1484
01:54:28,230 --> 01:54:29,210
No, this is actually good.

1485
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:30,730
I was gonna say, why am I so slow?

1486
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:32,410
No, it's fine.

1487
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:33,550
Being slow is fine here.

1488
01:54:34,210 --> 01:54:34,570
Actually.

1489
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:36,510
That's actually pretty good.

1490
01:54:38,810 --> 01:54:43,130
As long as I don't get cornered when title wave is on, then we should be fine.

1491
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:50,420
Okay, I wanna kill these guys in front of me a little bit.

1492
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:53,040
I think we might need damage.

1493
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:54,440
We're not one-shotting them anymore.

1494
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:57,320
And I'm a little scared of that.

1495
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:57,880
Oh, nice.

1496
01:54:58,560 --> 01:54:59,580
These guys are so fast.

1497
01:55:01,180 --> 01:55:03,320
It's crazy that she hasn't given me the salad yet.

1498
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:05,300
She's like, no salad, no salad.

1499
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:07,100
No salad.

1500
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:09,440
Okay, fine.

1501
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:14,680
Like, we're not getting the salad.

1502
01:55:16,300 --> 01:55:18,080
Okay, the bunnies are not...

1503
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:18,640
Oh, there you go.

1504
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:20,840
JK, it's salad time.

1505
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,680
We're gonna put you on die.

1506
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:41,060
it all right here you go oh my god he has a barrier now okay nice i should have needed that too because the more salad we eat the stronger she gets i know it's because she's angry at mirri or something

1507
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:59,960
okay i just need to survive for three more minutes and then we win uh i'll get that Because we're not one-shining them anymore, which is a little scary.

1508
01:56:00,180 --> 01:56:02,460
Oh, oh, oh, remember when I said it.

1509
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:04,620
This is okay as long as I don't get cornered?

1510
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:07,880
It's okay.

1511
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:11,680
If I keep going left, I can escape the corner.

1512
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:12,400
See?

1513
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:15,560
I escaped it.

1514
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:18,260
And there's the XP stuff.

1515
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:22,680
There you go.

1516
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:27,600
It's fine.

1517
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:28,620
Just kill him, too.

1518
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:30,520
What?

1519
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:31,300
He charges?

1520
01:56:32,860 --> 01:56:33,900
Okay, we definitely want more.

1521
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:35,280
Oh, my God.

1522
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:38,520
You can see on my top right how many... I ate a lot of burgers.

1523
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:39,780
That is 55 burgers.

1524
01:56:39,980 --> 01:56:41,540
That's 54 burgers.

1525
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:43,480
This is why you're on a diet, Sabrina.

1526
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:46,460
You had 54 burgers.

1527
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:47,460
That ain't normal.

1528
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:51,120
Within 10 minutes, Sabrina.

1529
01:56:51,860 --> 01:56:53,700
You know how much that cost me?

1530
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:58,200
Uh...

1531
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:00,760
Bullet size.

1532
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:02,280
Just make bigger bullets.

1533
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:04,340
Oh, no.

1534
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:05,140
Okay, that's fine.

1535
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:06,960
Let her eat.

1536
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:08,780
She deserves it.

1537
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:12,100
Okay.

1538
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:13,880
Uh, bullet damage.

1539
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:16,500
So they can... She can one-shot.

1540
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:17,480
Yeah, there you go.

1541
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:18,460
Now I'm one-shotting.

1542
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:20,020
I'm one-shotting now.

1543
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:22,200
So now, now just get fired.

1544
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:26,860
And she's a growing girl.

1545
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:31,500
Brode enough, guys!

1546
01:57:35,890 --> 01:57:36,270
Yeah.

1547
01:57:39,010 --> 01:57:39,990
Well, I can one shot.

1548
01:57:40,090 --> 01:57:40,790
Okay, never mind.

1549
01:57:41,970 --> 01:57:43,990
Uh, we'll focus on fire right after.

1550
01:57:44,410 --> 01:57:44,850
Oh, no.

1551
01:57:45,470 --> 01:57:45,930
It's fine.

1552
01:57:46,770 --> 01:57:47,690
I can't get coordinator here.

1553
01:57:47,790 --> 01:57:48,570
I still have space.

1554
01:57:49,670 --> 01:57:51,950
I just would like to grab the XP, though.

1555
01:57:57,020 --> 01:57:58,320
All right, 30 seconds.

1556
01:57:58,440 --> 01:58:00,380
I just gotta survive for 30 seconds.

1557
01:58:03,120 --> 01:58:03,600
Woo!

1558
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:04,320
Woo!

1559
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:09,800
Oh, we're almost there.

1560
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:12,140
10 seconds, and I win.

1561
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:14,500
Oh, man.

1562
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:19,180
I'm glad it doesn't have unlimited mode because we'd be here for a while.

1563
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:25,620
For now.

1564
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:26,900
For now.

1565
01:58:28,780 --> 01:58:31,000
All right, let's grab the last food upgrade.

1566
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:38,670
Oh, wait, it's been.

1567
01:58:38,690 --> 01:58:39,650
Oh, never mind.

1568
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:40,690
It's past...

1569
01:58:41,950 --> 01:58:43,130
Does she know?

1570
01:58:43,310 --> 01:58:44,030
Okay, never mind.

1571
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:45,250
We're still going.

1572
01:58:45,370 --> 01:58:45,950
I thought...

1573
01:58:45,950 --> 01:58:46,530
Okay.

1574
01:58:47,070 --> 01:58:47,610
Never mind.

1575
01:58:47,710 --> 01:58:48,610
We're still going.

1576
01:58:48,710 --> 01:58:49,950
We're still going.

1577
01:58:53,070 --> 01:58:54,490
Okay, my health is fine.

1578
01:58:57,110 --> 01:58:59,070
Okay, we got to survive for 10 more minutes.

1579
01:59:00,030 --> 01:59:01,390
Oh, this one's 20 minutes.

1580
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:01,710
Okay.

1581
01:59:03,150 --> 01:59:05,070
Oh, there is unlimited mode?

1582
01:59:05,450 --> 01:59:08,450
Wait, do you have to beat this to get unlimited mode?

1583
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:16,920
Oh,

1584
01:59:22,550 --> 01:59:23,530
that makes sense.

1585
01:59:23,710 --> 01:59:25,990
They want to test if you're a real gamer.

1586
01:59:28,350 --> 01:59:28,590
Oh, my God.

1587
01:59:28,670 --> 01:59:29,330
I need so much XP.

1588
01:59:29,510 --> 01:59:31,170
I'm so broke right now.

1589
01:59:31,570 --> 01:59:33,050
I've been...

1590
01:59:33,050 --> 01:59:34,670
They've been guarding the XP.

1591
01:59:36,230 --> 01:59:36,510
There you go.

1592
01:59:38,350 --> 01:59:38,710
Oh, no.

1593
01:59:38,830 --> 01:59:39,050
It's fine.

1594
01:59:39,150 --> 01:59:39,330
It's fine.

1595
01:59:39,450 --> 01:59:40,190
I have the heal thing.

1596
01:59:42,290 --> 01:59:42,930
It's okay.

1597
01:59:43,990 --> 01:59:44,910
Bye, bunnies.

1598
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:48,750
Oh, no.

1599
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:49,530
Oh, no.

1600
01:59:49,570 --> 01:59:50,050
Oh, no.

1601
01:59:50,290 --> 01:59:50,790
Oh, no.

1602
01:59:51,010 --> 01:59:51,510
Oh, no.

1603
01:59:51,730 --> 01:59:52,210
Oh, no.

1604
01:59:52,310 --> 01:59:52,790
Okay, it's fine.

1605
01:59:52,910 --> 01:59:53,050
It's fine.

1606
01:59:53,330 --> 01:59:53,430
It's fine.

1607
01:59:53,550 --> 01:59:53,610
It's fine.

1608
01:59:53,610 --> 01:59:54,530
I can make my own pathway.

1609
01:59:54,970 --> 01:59:55,990
I can make it.

1610
01:59:57,990 --> 01:59:59,110
Uh, okay.

1611
01:59:59,110 --> 01:59:59,170
Okay.

1612
01:59:59,170 --> 01:59:59,830
We just need more damage.

1613
02:00:00,030 --> 02:00:00,250
It's okay.

1614
02:00:00,510 --> 02:00:00,770
It's okay.

1615
02:00:01,050 --> 02:00:01,350
It's okay.

1616
02:00:02,230 --> 02:00:02,590
It's okay.

1617
02:00:02,870 --> 02:00:03,150
It's okay.

1618
02:00:03,230 --> 02:00:03,370
It's okay.

1619
02:00:04,830 --> 02:00:05,190
It's okay.

1620
02:00:16,990 --> 02:00:18,910
Not too cocky.

1621
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:22,710
I'm sad.

1622
02:00:23,290 --> 02:00:24,110
I'm so sad.

1623
02:00:24,330 --> 02:00:25,290
At least I get more stuff.

1624
02:00:25,610 --> 02:00:25,770
Wait.

1625
02:00:26,030 --> 02:00:26,150
Wait.

1626
02:00:26,290 --> 02:00:26,890
Are these gifts?

1627
02:00:28,530 --> 02:00:29,430
Are these gifts?

1628
02:00:29,770 --> 02:00:31,270
I put myself in the corner.

1629
02:00:31,730 --> 02:00:35,110
I told myself I wouldn't put myself in the corner.

1630
02:00:35,230 --> 02:00:35,810
Are these gifts?

1631
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:39,900
All right.

1632
02:00:39,980 --> 02:00:40,180
See?

1633
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:40,920
I'm sorry.

1634
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:42,020
I'm so sorry.

1635
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:45,600
Kuka, I would never do it again.

1636
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:48,260
I'm so sorry.

1637
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:54,840
Here you go.

1638
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:56,720
Oh, she looked at me.

1639
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:57,960
She forgave me.

1640
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:00,320
Guys, she forgave me.

1641
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:02,620
Did you see it?

1642
02:01:02,820 --> 02:01:04,140
She gave me that look.

1643
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:05,880
She gave me that look.

1644
02:01:06,220 --> 02:01:10,280
Okay, now, as a friend here.

1645
02:01:12,220 --> 02:01:12,400
Alright.

1646
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:13,320
See, look.

1647
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:14,660
It's just a friend gift.

1648
02:01:15,680 --> 02:01:18,100
Look, she forgave me, guys.

1649
02:01:18,360 --> 02:02:16,280

1650
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:21,340
Oh, it's in Niki.

1651
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:23,120
Oh, it's in the top of the events.

1652
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,220
Here it is.

1653
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:34,600
Oh, it seems it'll be this one, right?

1654
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:36,000
It's Boundary Push.

1655
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:37,080
Oh, here it is.

1656
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:37,580
This is.

1657
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:42,940
Boundary Push.

1658
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:45,360
So this is the new... Oh, there it is.

1659
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:45,900
Oh.

1660
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:46,920
Wait.

1661
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:48,660
Low 55.

1662
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:52,640
What level am I?

1663
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:53,720
What?

1664
02:02:54,540 --> 02:02:57,100
Wait, how do I get to level 55?

1665
02:02:57,980 --> 02:02:59,080
I'm not high

1666
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:03,540
enough.

1667
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:10,060
I'm level 42.

1668
02:03:11,120 --> 02:03:14,540
Wait, how do you get to level 55?

1669
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:19,220
That's a lot of...

1670
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,940
Time to cry.

1671
02:03:41,670 --> 02:03:53,050
all right all right well it's okay i know what it is though i didn't have time to make a long stream

1672
02:03:58,390 --> 02:04:22,570
anyway so for those who aren't level 55 for those who are level 55 um Basically, you have to gather materials to upgrade the remoting pattern, and then the remoting pattern boosts the doll's base stacks and locks various power effects with special growth data.

1673
02:04:23,030 --> 02:04:24,070
So, just imagine.

1674
02:04:28,610 --> 02:04:30,590
Just imagine it.

1675
02:04:30,930 --> 02:04:33,370
And each area has, like, four floors.

1676
02:04:34,070 --> 02:04:39,130
So, and I think, like, they change the room a lot, too.

1677
02:04:39,910 --> 02:04:48,470
A boss will appear on the first floor of each area and it's guaranteed to drop one oval growth data So which is good.

1678
02:04:48,770 --> 02:05:42,000
Um, yeah, imagine And there's a lot of like commemorative items trophies and uh various qualities will drop as well Just imagine it imagine if I'm playing it right now and It'll become available each week and apparently there's like little easter eggs for week too so like if you guys want to explore a lot more you can get like little easter eggs too all right anyway i guess we'll just try we'll try assault simulation all right i believe i was looking at that earlier too there you go we can do at least we can do this all right challenge choose our dog um there you go kukai there you go see yeah uh I think auto,

1679
02:05:42,100 --> 02:05:44,060
because I don't know which skill it is.

1680
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:46,960
Is this mode actually insanely hard?

1681
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:49,500
How is this hard?

1682
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:52,780
I just shoot the bots.

1683
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:03,400
This isn't that hard.

1684
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:08,360
I just shoot the bots.

1685
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:10,840
I'm training.

1686
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:16,680
Peek-a-poo!

1687
02:06:17,420 --> 02:06:18,120
Peek-a-poo!

1688
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:18,800
That's right!

1689
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:19,300
Peek-a-poo!

1690
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:19,300
That's right!

1691
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:19,580
Peek-a-poo!

1692
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:20,460
Do they shoot back?

1693
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:26,080
First rule of robotics Don't shoot back

1694
02:06:29,290 --> 02:06:36,510
Okay Oh I have poison now

1695
02:06:41,180 --> 02:06:53,960
Okay I have unlimited ammo Come out Oh the black box is also targets Oh I didn't realize I thought they were just like props Okay

1696
02:06:59,030 --> 02:07:03,130
Like it has a happy face I thought he was a good guy Why?

1697
02:07:04,450 --> 02:07:06,870
He's smiling at me.

1698
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:13,100
It's fine.

1699
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:15,560
Peekaboo!

1700
02:07:19,250 --> 02:07:20,210
That was easy.

1701
02:07:25,020 --> 02:07:25,040
Okay.

1702
02:07:26,060 --> 02:07:27,040
He's like, Peekaboo!

1703
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:28,220
I'm over here!

1704
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:29,260
No, I'm over here!

1705
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:35,840
Why do I have to shoot someone that smiles at me?

1706
02:07:39,650 --> 02:07:40,370
Wait, what?

1707
02:07:40,530 --> 02:07:41,230
Is he bad?

1708
02:07:42,670 --> 02:07:43,610
Wait, he has a face!

1709
02:07:47,130 --> 02:07:48,410
That's right, get down!

1710
02:07:48,830 --> 02:07:49,930
Get out of here!

1711
02:07:51,230 --> 02:07:52,090
Let's go shoot here.

1712
02:07:52,470 --> 02:07:53,850
She gets so much points.

1713
02:07:55,050 --> 02:07:56,310
She gives a lot of points.

1714
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:02,900
Oh my gosh, she's still alive?

1715
02:08:06,860 --> 02:08:07,160
Okay.

1716
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:15,280
We got this.

1717
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:17,400
Wait, how long does this last for?

1718
02:08:18,740 --> 02:08:19,420
It's the last wave.

1719
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:21,640
Alright, give me all the points.

1720
02:08:22,900 --> 02:08:24,220
Headshot, headshot, headshot.

1721
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:25,760
Wait, it's unkillable?

1722
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:28,380
Was it even worth shooting at her?

1723
02:08:28,700 --> 02:08:29,640
They're just trapped.

1724
02:08:29,780 --> 02:08:30,160
Yeah!

1725
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:31,720
Easy.

1726
02:08:34,420 --> 02:08:34,940
Easy.

1727
02:08:37,180 --> 02:08:38,280
I'm a winner.

1728
02:08:39,540 --> 02:08:40,160
Opens that.

1729
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:41,200
Oh yeah, so each week.

1730
02:08:41,940 --> 02:08:43,200
Each week there's new

1731
02:08:46,700 --> 02:08:48,560
new challenges to try out.

1732
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:57,420
Alright, now, now we can try out, we can try out the new character we pulled.

1733
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:59,200
I just realized we never tried it out, so we should.

1734
02:09:00,940 --> 02:09:02,600
It's at each day, it's at each day.

1735
02:09:03,200 --> 02:09:06,620
My brain is, like, scrambled ever since Klu-Kai locked me out of the house.

1736
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:11,320
Ever since Klu-Kai locked me out.

1737
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:15,540
My brain has not, my brain has been so scrambled by her.

1738
02:09:15,900 --> 02:09:16,140
Yeah.

1739
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:22,680
Every time I close my eyes, all I could think about is here.

1740
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:27,760
Oh my gosh, I automatically click the refitting room because of it.

1741
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:32,220
Yeah, Dianne Yuan wants to be with the electric team.

1742
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:34,660
What do you guys want?

1743
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:37,320
Wait, someone asked me to try something.

1744
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:41,780
Boundary push.

1745
02:09:41,900 --> 02:09:42,880
Oh, wait, this one.

1746
02:09:46,700 --> 02:09:47,620
We try boundary push.

1747
02:09:47,700 --> 02:09:48,300
Can I try?

1748
02:09:48,300 --> 02:10:01,180
I put it in Replace Replace Oh my gosh She's so weak right now

1749
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:23,040
Alright Do I have to bring in a full army What if like Does it have to be four people What if I just put Klu-Kai and Jiang Yu Wait, where's Springfield?

1750
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:29,860
Yeah, I want to bring Springfield.

1751
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:34,280
Strongly recommend.

1752
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:36,780
Oh, so it's recommended.

1753
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:40,740
It's just recommended.

1754
02:10:47,940 --> 02:10:49,600
Where is Springfield?

1755
02:10:51,740 --> 02:10:52,640
Oh, there she is.

1756
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:55,880
I will replace her.

1757
02:10:57,860 --> 02:10:59,100
There we go.

1758
02:11:00,580 --> 02:11:00,840
Alright.

1759
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:07,980
I don't know if like this is a good build but we can try.

1760
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:10,840
My wife and my friends.

1761
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:20,190
Alright so we all know this is a strategy game and I'm really good at that.

1762
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:23,560
Oh wait it's not.

1763
02:11:24,060 --> 02:11:25,160
This party's not.

1764
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:27,120
Hello.

1765
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:28,440
What?

1766
02:11:29,140 --> 02:11:29,960
Oh shit!

1767
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:57,660
I just wanted to say hi I just I just wanted to say hi I didn't know I wanted to say hi good bro okay I was just saying hi

1768
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:03,300
Skip it.

1769
02:12:04,180 --> 02:12:04,180
Okay.

1770
02:12:06,700 --> 02:12:08,260
Shoot him.

1771
02:12:11,260 --> 02:12:11,640
Oh my god.

1772
02:12:11,780 --> 02:12:12,740
You don't do anything.

1773
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:14,460
Alright.

1774
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:14,800
Wait.

1775
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:16,260
Gentle approach.

1776
02:12:18,120 --> 02:12:18,720
You see.

1777
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:20,620
This is why she lied.

1778
02:12:21,340 --> 02:12:23,740
I just wanted to say hi.

1779
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:27,500
You feel...

1780
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:28,500
Oh now I do stuff.

1781
02:12:29,720 --> 02:12:30,820
Oh my skills.

1782
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:31,560
Meteor.

1783
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:37,900
Is that one enemy target?

1784
02:12:37,980 --> 02:12:38,360
I did.

1785
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:39,420
Oh, wait.

1786
02:12:39,580 --> 02:12:40,180
This is easier.

1787
02:12:40,900 --> 02:12:41,000
Boom!

1788
02:12:41,180 --> 02:12:41,900
I set it up!

1789
02:12:42,040 --> 02:12:43,320
Oh, never mind.

1790
02:12:46,100 --> 02:12:48,700
Klu-Kai can wipe the board if used correctly.

1791
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:50,280
Alright, just gotta...

1792
02:12:50,280 --> 02:12:53,120
Guess I just gotta use it correctly, guys.

1793
02:12:56,400 --> 02:12:57,220
There you go.

1794
02:12:59,660 --> 02:12:59,940
Nice.

1795
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:00,640
I did it.

1796
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:04,700
Okay, I might have messed up and, like, Send her.

1797
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:05,920
Got her shot.

1798
02:13:06,040 --> 02:13:06,740
But that's okay.

1799
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:09,620
Oh, spam force.

1800
02:13:12,580 --> 02:13:13,100
Boom!

1801
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:13,920
Tornado!

1802
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:16,920
Oh, this is our new- Oh, she's so fast!

1803
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:20,240
Oh my god, wait, I got- Okay, we don't need to be too fast.

1804
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:24,320
Did anyone caught the tornado?

1805
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:30,060
Your turn.

1806
02:13:32,260 --> 02:13:32,780
Oh!

1807
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:33,360
Oh!

1808
02:13:34,160 --> 02:14:06,340

I'm gonna just shoot him, I guess.

1810
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:11,380
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

1811
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:14,500
What?

1812
02:14:15,800 --> 02:14:17,400
What did she say?

1813
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:24,080
Oh.

1814
02:14:25,820 --> 02:14:26,400
Oopsie.

1815
02:14:28,580 --> 02:14:34,140
Alright, now that I know what to do, what's this?

1816
02:14:34,700 --> 02:14:35,460
Crisis level.

1817
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:37,240
Whoa, how did they know?

1818
02:14:39,380 --> 02:14:40,800
How do they know though?

1819
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:42,900
I found three of the three.

1820
02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:47,200
Why is there a crisis level?

1821
02:14:47,380 --> 02:14:49,040
They don't know I'm here.

1822
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:52,060
Okay.

1823
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:55,580
We can do this.

1824
02:14:59,030 --> 02:15:00,230
Where's the- where's the ladder?

1825
02:15:00,750 --> 02:15:01,770
Alright, we can do this.

1826
02:15:02,930 --> 02:15:04,590
I can shoot from here.

1827
02:15:08,250 --> 02:15:08,890
There you go.

1828
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:12,710
See?

1829
02:15:13,330 --> 02:15:14,170
I told you guys.

1830
02:15:14,270 --> 02:15:15,110
Oh, she saw me.

1831
02:15:16,330 --> 02:15:17,670
Look, I'm sorry!

1832
02:15:19,570 --> 02:15:21,090
I don't understand.

1833
02:15:21,650 --> 02:15:23,570
How do they keep finding him?

1834
02:15:25,110 --> 02:15:25,750
Wait, is this?

1835
02:15:26,230 --> 02:15:27,170
Watch this.

1836
02:15:28,710 --> 02:15:29,750
Wait, where am I going?

1837
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:37,160
Ooh!

1838
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:39,380
Oh my god, they're all dead.

1839
02:15:39,800 --> 02:15:41,280
And this is why you're my wife.

1840
02:15:47,950 --> 02:15:48,450
Pop.

1841
02:15:50,990 --> 02:15:54,990
Pop, oh, maybe I should have not popped him next to me.

1842
02:15:56,410 --> 02:15:57,890
Yay, I did it.

1843
02:16:00,230 --> 02:16:02,230
She's like, wait, I'm not done.

1844
02:16:02,510 --> 02:16:05,670
Let me stand, let me stand behind real quick.

1845
02:16:09,230 --> 02:16:10,430
Oh my god.

1846
02:16:14,410 --> 02:16:15,230
Oh, I did it.

1847
02:16:15,290 --> 02:16:19,510
Okay, that's what you guys said when you're like, yeah, Klu-Kai can basically kill everyone.

1848
02:16:24,050 --> 02:16:26,490
And then, let's open this.

1849
02:16:29,370 --> 02:16:30,350
Uh, where else?

1850
02:16:30,850 --> 02:16:33,050
I guess I can lock, yeah, unlock this area now.

1851
02:16:34,570 --> 02:16:34,990
Yeah, I'll do it two times.

1852
02:16:35,030 --> 02:16:37,590
I just wanted to see the, uh...

1853
02:16:37,590 --> 02:16:39,130
Okay, I can kill him, though.

1854
02:16:41,170 --> 02:16:42,590
Oh, my God!

1855
02:16:42,870 --> 02:16:43,990
Oh, I didn't see that guy!

1856
02:16:44,350 --> 02:16:45,510
Do you think he saw it?

1857
02:16:45,750 --> 02:16:45,910
Oh!

1858
02:16:49,210 --> 02:16:51,610
I didn't realize he had friends!

1859
02:16:52,330 --> 02:16:59,700
How was I supposed to?

1860
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:00,220
It's okay.

1861
02:17:00,940 --> 02:17:02,420
Klu-Kai's got the motorcycle.

1862
02:17:06,040 --> 02:17:06,360
Yay!

1863
02:17:07,880 --> 02:17:08,440
Stealth.

1864
02:17:09,680 --> 02:17:09,940
Oh.

1865
02:17:10,500 --> 02:17:11,280
That's awkward.

1866
02:17:13,740 --> 02:17:14,540
It's okay.

1867
02:17:14,620 --> 02:17:15,760
I have healers.

1868
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:18,540
Alright, Klu-Kai.

1869
02:17:18,740 --> 02:17:21,360
We gotta let other people have fun too, Klu-Kai.

1870
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:24,480
Alright.

1871
02:17:24,560 --> 02:17:25,900
Well, okay.

1872
02:17:26,020 --> 02:17:27,220
This is a little awkward.

1873
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:27,860
You know what?

1874
02:17:28,340 --> 02:17:31,680
Let's grab her in so, like, my wife won't get shot.

1875
02:17:33,180 --> 02:17:35,100
I feel like that might be ideal.

1876
02:17:35,580 --> 02:17:36,360
Yeah, I killed everybody.

1877
02:17:36,480 --> 02:17:37,000
Let's go.

1878
02:17:38,520 --> 02:17:38,820
All right.

1879
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:41,480
Then my wife can stop getting shot at.

1880
02:17:43,660 --> 02:17:44,540
Okay, now.

1881
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:45,800
Okay, wait, I got this.

1882
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:47,620
All right.

1883
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:50,680
I just have to shoot.

1884
02:17:51,860 --> 02:17:52,380
Where do I?

1885
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:53,480
Where do I shoot?

1886
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:59,180
Like, there's nothing to shoot at.

1887
02:18:02,120 --> 02:18:03,160
Like, he's gonna...

1888
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:05,080
Wait, if I'm in the bush, they can't see me, right?

1889
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:08,720
Okay, he saw me.

1890
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:14,080
Guys, I think I did the puzzle.

1891
02:18:17,690 --> 02:18:19,730
You think I did the puzzle correctly?

1892
02:18:24,860 --> 02:18:25,300
Okay.

1893
02:18:28,580 --> 02:18:29,460
Lightning smash.

1894
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:33,440
I wish I wanted to do the tornado again.

1895
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:35,700
Confirm.

1896
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:36,960
There you go.

1897
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:37,960
Tornado kick!

1898
02:18:42,060 --> 02:18:43,480
Oh, that's so cool.

1899
02:18:47,860 --> 02:18:51,240
I guess you can...

1900
02:18:51,240 --> 02:18:52,480
Let's get closer to them.

1901
02:18:53,820 --> 02:18:55,140
You're all about the melee, right?

1902
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:55,820
All right.

1903
02:18:57,420 --> 02:18:57,760
Wait.

1904
02:18:58,260 --> 02:18:59,060
Now we'll let...

1905
02:18:59,060 --> 02:19:02,220
Now we'll let Klu-Kai sweep the entire.

1906
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:05,720
game yeah

1907
02:19:09,680 --> 02:19:46,760

1908
02:19:50,830 --> 02:19:51,550
Anything here?

1909
02:19:53,150 --> 02:19:53,990
If I can jump down.

1910
02:19:54,050 --> 02:19:54,650
No, I can't.

1911
02:19:54,790 --> 02:19:55,610
I gotta use a ladder.

1912
02:19:55,770 --> 02:19:56,490
Safety first.

1913
02:19:56,650 --> 02:19:57,790
Oh, I guess I don't use a ladder.

1914
02:19:57,790 --> 02:19:58,450
I just jump down.

1915
02:19:58,870 --> 02:19:58,950
All right.

1916
02:19:59,170 --> 02:20:02,330
If I'm gonna jump anyway, why can't I just jump?

1917
02:20:02,870 --> 02:20:04,790
Like, I don't understand.

1918
02:20:04,950 --> 02:20:06,850
If I'm gonna jump anyway, just let me jump.

1919
02:20:08,430 --> 02:20:08,750
Okay.

1920
02:20:08,930 --> 02:20:09,470
Puzzle tab.

1921
02:20:09,630 --> 02:20:09,790
All right.

1922
02:20:09,850 --> 02:20:10,830
This is where I do the stealth.

1923
02:20:10,950 --> 02:20:11,410
Watch this.

1924
02:20:14,350 --> 02:20:15,490
Nobody's looking at him.

1925
02:20:17,570 --> 02:20:17,730
See?

1926
02:20:17,750 --> 02:20:17,910
See?

1927
02:20:18,330 --> 02:20:19,110
I did it.

1928
02:20:19,830 --> 02:20:19,950
Oh.

1929
02:20:21,870 --> 02:20:22,310
Oh.

1930
02:20:23,810 --> 02:20:24,190
Oh.

1931
02:20:24,810 --> 02:20:27,330
You guys?

1932
02:20:27,470 --> 02:20:28,130
Okay, nice.

1933
02:20:29,250 --> 02:20:30,510
Okay, and then I shoot him.

1934
02:20:33,810 --> 02:20:33,950
Oh.

1935
02:20:36,050 --> 02:20:36,550
Oh, wait.

1936
02:20:36,630 --> 02:20:37,630
He was looking at him?

1937
02:20:37,870 --> 02:20:39,650
How was I supposed to know?

1938
02:20:44,070 --> 02:20:47,310
How was I supposed to know he was looking at him?

1939
02:20:47,750 --> 02:20:50,050
I was behind a box!

1940
02:20:51,950 --> 02:20:53,030
Oh, he survived.

1941
02:20:53,150 --> 02:20:53,650
Oh, okay.

1942
02:20:53,770 --> 02:20:54,750
That makes more sense.

1943
02:20:55,530 --> 02:20:56,390
What's this?

1944
02:20:59,410 --> 02:21:01,230
Oh, that's a cute move.

1945
02:21:01,530 --> 02:21:02,750
Okay, we're gonna...

1946
02:21:05,210 --> 02:21:07,810
Alright, we're not gonna kill everything for now.

1947
02:21:08,250 --> 02:21:10,870
Because I want Springfield to have a chance to fight.

1948
02:21:13,130 --> 02:21:14,270
Alright, Springfield.

1949
02:21:15,170 --> 02:21:16,030
Oh, never mind.

1950
02:21:16,450 --> 02:21:17,670
I mean, you can kill them.

1951
02:21:17,750 --> 02:21:19,030
Maybe what?

1952
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:24,100
Oh, that was an elite enemy?

1953
02:21:25,400 --> 02:21:28,540
I can't believe she brought a pool to a war.

1954
02:21:28,860 --> 02:21:32,480
Thank you.

1955
02:21:36,540 --> 02:21:38,020
Alright, can I heal anybody?

1956
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:39,620
Oh, it's Supernova Blackhull.

1957
02:21:40,620 --> 02:21:41,500
Let's get a Blackhull.

1958
02:21:41,620 --> 02:21:43,700
Let's just send a Blackhull in here, too.

1959
02:21:46,200 --> 02:21:47,160
Alright, Springfield.

1960
02:21:47,620 --> 02:21:48,300
It's time.

1961
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:50,720
And summons wallet.

1962
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:52,420
Four, three rounds.

1963
02:21:53,100 --> 02:21:55,560
I did this move already, so I want to try this one.

1964
02:21:56,140 --> 02:21:56,840
But I want to try this.

1965
02:21:56,960 --> 02:21:58,140
Wait, is this heal?

1966
02:21:59,660 --> 02:22:01,440
Oh, yeah, I got to heal Klu-Kai.

1967
02:22:02,860 --> 02:22:04,160
All right, get healed!

1968
02:22:05,940 --> 02:22:06,740
Don't worry.

1969
02:22:07,480 --> 02:22:08,960
My bird will give you heal.

1970
02:22:11,220 --> 02:22:12,140
All right, Klu-Kai.

1971
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:14,800
Oh, I was going to say, Klu-Kai, you can sweep it now.

1972
02:22:17,540 --> 02:22:18,540
I know where I got.

1973
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:19,620
I got Klu-Kai.

1974
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:22,080
Dance time.

1975
02:22:27,860 --> 02:22:28,560
Oh, yeah.

1976
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:29,920
Four also heals everyone.

1977
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:30,500
Everybody.

1978
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:32,680
Well, she got double the heals.

1979
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:35,080
She got extra heals.

1980
02:22:35,880 --> 02:22:37,640
Oh, I forgot there was this one guy up here.

1981
02:22:37,760 --> 02:22:38,920
Wait, he has his own bird?

1982
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:40,760
Oh, my God.

1983
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:42,980
Oh, he dies from that.

1984
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:43,460
Yay.

1985
02:22:44,880 --> 02:22:45,400
See?

1986
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:48,380
She's extra healthy now.

1987
02:22:49,780 --> 02:22:50,300
Okay.

1988
02:22:50,960 --> 02:22:51,800
Go this way.

1989
02:22:52,420 --> 02:22:53,200
Grab some stuff.

1990
02:22:55,780 --> 02:22:56,400
Get here.

1991
02:22:58,220 --> 02:22:58,880
All right.

1992
02:22:59,360 --> 02:23:00,100
Is that the boss?

1993
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:04,600
Oh, that's my bird?

1994
02:23:05,480 --> 02:23:05,580
Oh.

1995
02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:07,740
Can't see me.

1996
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:11,820
Oh, can't see me.

1997
02:23:11,860 --> 02:23:13,880
Wait, what happens if...

1998
02:23:13,880 --> 02:23:16,820
Wait, does that mean I can, like, one-shot him?

1999
02:23:17,080 --> 02:23:17,440
Oh, no.

2000
02:23:17,440 --> 02:23:20,160
It's just so I can, like, kill his buddies.

2001
02:23:22,800 --> 02:23:24,340
No one's looking at you, right?

2002
02:23:25,420 --> 02:23:26,260
No, there is.

2003
02:23:26,540 --> 02:23:27,600
Someone's looking at him.

2004
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:31,100
I don't know if I can stealth this.

2005
02:23:33,020 --> 02:23:33,480
Can I?

2006
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:38,780
I mean, nobody's looking at him.

2007
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:41,840
Because nobody will ever remember.

2008
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:44,260
Oh, that's right.

2009
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:46,820
Yoink, my, got your life.

2010
02:23:48,740 --> 02:23:50,940
No one's looking at him, so it should be fine.

2011
02:23:52,740 --> 02:23:55,160
All right, I'm going to get rid of the little guys first.

2012
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,920
All right, now I can kill him.

2013
02:24:04,140 --> 02:24:04,300
Yeah.

2014
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:07,360
Nobody's looking at him, too.

2015
02:24:08,560 --> 02:24:09,260
There you go.

2016
02:24:10,420 --> 02:24:10,600
Yoink.

2017
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:11,960
My life now.

2018
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:16,440
There's one more guy here.

2019
02:24:19,580 --> 02:24:20,080
Okay.

2020
02:24:21,180 --> 02:24:23,320
All right, now he's defenseless.

2021
02:24:23,500 --> 02:24:24,920
What you gonna do now?

2022
02:24:25,940 --> 02:24:27,600
You're defenseless now.

2023
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:28,700
Are there sparrows?

2024
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:29,880
There is.

2025
02:24:30,100 --> 02:24:31,760
Okay, I can shoot these barrels at him.

2026
02:24:34,960 --> 02:24:35,600
That's right.

2027
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:39,000
Oh, he didn't see.

2028
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:40,520
Oh, who did that?

2029
02:24:40,900 --> 02:24:42,220
Couldn't be me.

2030
02:24:48,260 --> 02:24:48,600
Okay.

2031
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:51,040
Oh, there's no more.

2032
02:24:51,580 --> 02:24:53,190
All right, I just, I guess I'll just shoot him.

2033
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:57,380
That's right, it was me!

2034
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:02,880
It must have been the win.

2035
02:25:07,900 --> 02:25:08,860
Alright, Kuduka.

2036
02:25:10,480 --> 02:25:11,720
Go do your thing.

2037
02:25:14,660 --> 02:25:15,980
I just...

2038
02:25:15,980 --> 02:25:16,960
Oh, here.

2039
02:25:18,780 --> 02:25:19,420
Alright, Kuduka.

2040
02:25:19,700 --> 02:25:20,560
Do your thing.

2041
02:25:22,270 --> 02:25:22,600
Okay.

2042
02:25:24,200 --> 02:25:29,420
Yeah, I would- I'm wondering why would you place like an explosive barrel next to it.

2043
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:31,380
Nice.

2044
02:25:31,780 --> 02:25:33,060
I did it.

2045
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:33,540
Yay!

2046
02:25:40,530 --> 02:25:40,970
Reload.

2047
02:25:42,890 --> 02:25:43,610
Oh, reload.

2048
02:25:46,510 --> 02:25:47,410
Boss is dead.

2049
02:25:47,530 --> 02:25:48,050
Boss dead.

2050
02:25:49,330 --> 02:25:49,650
Yay!

2051
02:25:51,710 --> 02:25:52,710
Oh, we try to grab that.

2052
02:25:52,770 --> 02:25:53,450
Oh, I'm on fire.

2053
02:25:53,570 --> 02:25:53,750
Oops.

2054
02:25:55,910 --> 02:25:57,930
I'm a strategic genius.

2055
02:26:00,810 --> 02:26:01,730
My one strategy.

2056
02:26:02,290 --> 02:26:02,830
Use wife.

2057
02:26:03,970 --> 02:26:05,470
What, you have to rest?

2058
02:26:08,570 --> 02:26:11,210
What do you mean you have to rest?

2059
02:26:12,230 --> 02:26:15,910
I'm at 0% battery on my dolls?

2060
02:26:16,990 --> 02:26:17,710
Job done.

2061
02:26:23,090 --> 02:26:25,690
Two of you didn't even do anything.

2062
02:26:25,910 --> 02:26:28,030
Klu-Kai did everything!

2063
02:26:29,650 --> 02:26:39,790
I would understand if Klu-Kai had to rest, but two of you, two of you, was just chilling there.

2064
02:26:40,810 --> 02:26:42,970
He's just walking around.

2065
02:26:47,670 --> 02:26:50,230
The other two actually did stuff.

2066
02:26:56,410 --> 02:26:59,190
I'm tired from watching her.

2067
02:27:03,070 --> 02:27:31,110
