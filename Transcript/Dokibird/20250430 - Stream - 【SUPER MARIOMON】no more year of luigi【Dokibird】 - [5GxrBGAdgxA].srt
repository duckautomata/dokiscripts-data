00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,480
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,100
Hello, it's me, Dokio.

3
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,200
I am a little low energy today.

4
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,280
It has been a lot of stuff going on the last couple of days.

5
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,820
I don't know if I want to put the hat on, guys.

6
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,380
Hat or no hat on, guys.

7
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:09,960
I don't know.

8
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:24,080
I think if I could turn off the bed, if I could, like, just snip the bird feathers, me, the teeny hat on, the hat stays on.

9
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,580
Anyway, I was gonna say, oh, yes, I am a little bit low energy.

10
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,940
Obviously, a lot of stuff has been going on.

11
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:40,100
Um, let me, actually, let me turn off the game music, because it's a little annoying while I just give you guys a little life update.

12
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,080
Um, anyway, um, B, put on the cat ears and B, cat Mario.

13
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,200
Okay, that's good.

14
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,260
That's good.

15
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,260
You always want Dough Kitty.

16
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,740
Every time.

17
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,180
I still have, I'm still here.

18
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,200
Doughkey Bird is still the main character of this channel.

19
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,740
It can't always be Dough Kitty.

20
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,300
Men only want one thing.

21
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,760
Um, this channel is, uh, Doughkey Bird, not Dough Kitty.

22
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,920
Uh, not Doughkey Cat.

23
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,760
It's, uh, Doughkey Bird.

24
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,920
Anyway, um, life update.

25
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:32,260
So, if you guys didn't know, um, Doughkey Amber Doge Dad, um, I recently picked him up, uh, yesterday at the vet hospital.

26
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,440
Um, he is doing okay.

27
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:47,420
Um, they gave me, okay, so, after I, like, you know, I was at the hospital, and then, you know, we had to do, like, a, you know, discharge information stuff about, like, um, what to prepare for.

28
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,540
So, he's at the dog sitter, and the dog sitter's the one that's gonna be, like, taking care of him for the first two weeks.

29
00:03:52,720 --> 00:04:00,840
Um, they're unsure they can take care of him after the first, after the two weeks are over, because, oh my god, looking at, it's so awkward to see myself talk with a mustache.

30
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,300
I'm sorry.

31
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,220
The mustache is so distracting.

32
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,420
I'm not gonna, I mean, I'm not looking at myself.

33
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,060
No, no.

34
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:18,760
The mustache is actually, I'm, like, trying to give, like, a serious life update right now, and, like, I just see the mustache, and I'm, like, okay, it's so hard to be serious, right?

35
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:30,280
Um, anyway, um, as I was saying, um, the mustache stays on!

36
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:50,720
Anyway, um, so, um, the, you know, okay, so for those who don't know, uh, dad had to, the reason why dad was at the hospital was because he, he must have jumped and landed wrong, um, and he is a wiener dog, so he is a dachshund, and for those who don't know about dachshunds,

37
00:04:50,860 --> 00:05:08,460
uh, they are, they are, their bodies are too long for jumping, but they don't know that, um, they're, they're too stubborn and stupid to realize, genetically, they're not supposed to jump, but they, but somehow, despite being bred to not jump, they are also,

38
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,880
genetically, it is encoded in their personalities to jump.

39
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,260
So, like, it conflicts a lot.

40
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,480
Like, they don't know that!

41
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,420
They don't know they're not allowed to jump, but they love jumping!

42
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,160
He's like, I will jump, despite what genetics or nature told me to.

43
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,920
Um, bees are genetically supposed to be not able to fly, but they do fly!

44
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:46,720
So, uh, um, so, anyway, um, anyway, so, basically, that was what the whole thing was about.

45
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,860
Um, and I did tell you guys, oh my god, every time I look in the corner of my eye, I just see myself with a mustache, and it is so distracting.

46
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,640
It is!

47
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,000
It is!

48
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,420
Our destiny is not written in our genes!

49
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:08,940
He, unfortunately, he was not the first wiener dog to, to, um, overcome his genetic coding.

50
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,840
That is so unfortunate that he was not the one to overcome it.

51
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:25,400
Anyway, so, if you guys didn't know that, uh, this is, like, the wiener dog owner's worst fear, which was to basically have a wiener dog that jumped and fucked up his back, because that's what he did.

52
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:34,160
Uh, he was, he was just trying to evolve, let him live, it's like, well, now, I have to pay $10,000!

53
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,240
So, he is not evolving no more!

54
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:50,720
Um, so, yes, anyway, uh, yes, this, I had to pay the very expensive surgery.

55
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,740
Uh, yes, now you realize why it's not cool for wiener dogs to jump!

56
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,880
I mean, sorry, I should have, like, coaxed that in more.

57
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,120
Um, freedom with a cost!

58
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:11,600
Uh, so, for those who don't know, these types of surgeries are incredibly expensive.

59
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,060
Um, but I want him to be able to walk because of what he did.

60
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:24,480
So, you know, he tried to fucking, he tried to, like, put himself in the handicap position.

61
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:33,320
He tried to make himself handicapped by jumping, And I was like, no, you are not allowed to not walk.

62
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:41,280
So, I had to pay the very expensive surgery to make sure he's still able to walk.

63
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:47,740
And he is not allowed to.

64
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,580
Okay, anyway.

65
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,700
Alright, so that was a short TLDR.

66
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,840
Sorry, I was going to give a longer story.

67
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,800
And, like, you know, coaxed into everything.

68
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,380
But, you guys are like, he wants to be free.

69
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:13,000
Well, I'm sorry, but I had to pay a lot of money to make sure you have your legs.

70
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,440
Anyway, okay.

71
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,680
Alright, let me retell this story.

72
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,640
Wonder5, thank you for the...

73
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,440
Welcome to the tomato farm.

74
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,020
Welcome, welcome.

75
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,000
Anyway.

76
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,800
Anyway, guys.

77
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,220
Back to the actual story.

78
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,740
So, we took him to the vet.

79
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,200
At first, you know, the vet first, we didn't take him to the specialist.

80
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,140
Because there is also a specialist hospital regarding, like, you know, regarding, like, neurological problems.

81
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,700
Which is what dad has.

82
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,560
Because, you know, it's like the infamous...

83
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,780
I forgot what it's called.

84
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,980
It's like the IVV, was it?

85
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,820
It's like the disc.

86
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,360
The disc in the spine.

87
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,360
And, like, it's, like, basically the disc on the spine.

88
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,060
Like, skewered in a way where, like...

89
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,540
Usually...

90
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,620
It's like two things.

91
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,500
It's either surgery or, like, rehabilitation.

92
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,640
Rehabilitation or, like, it's either surgery or rehabilitation slash physical therapy.

93
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,940
And then hope it gets better.

94
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,880
So, we had two options.

95
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,800
We either, like, just see it and let it recover on its own.

96
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,040
Or we get surgery.

97
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,140
So, the recovery...

98
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,460
We tried to do the recovery on its own.

99
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,980
But, obviously, it got worse.

100
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,760
So, that's why we took him to the neurological, like, specialist hospital.

101
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,140
Because, like, he started getting, like, wobbly and stuff like that.

102
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,960
Like, we could notice that he started wobbling.

103
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,240
And, like, he felt like when he was walking, it felt like he didn't really know how to walk a little.

104
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,480
So, it obviously felt like it was getting worse.

105
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,320
And then we're like, okay, we should take him to the specialist just to see what's going on.

106
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,680
And the specialist was like, yes, you could try to, like, continue.

107
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,260
Like, he still has, like, reaction to his legs.

108
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,760
Like, you know, he still was able to react to it and still has feeling in his legs.

109
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,800
But, like, we don't know if it will get better or worse.

110
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:19,500
So, if you do rehabilitation and physical therapy without the surgery, it was, like, a 60 to 80% chance of whether or not he'll recover from it.

111
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,860
And then, uh, so obviously, but we do surgery, it was, like, 90 to 98%.

112
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,280
So, I was like, I'm going with surgery.

113
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,720
Like, they're like, okay, obviously, there's costs and stuff involved.

114
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,200
Um, I was most afraid it was gonna be cancer.

115
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,100
Because then, the doctor was like, or it could be cancer.

116
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,880
And then, I was like, oh, what?

117
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,400
So, the vet was like, or it could be cancer.

118
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,340
So, let's hope it's just related to the disc.

119
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,960
So, I was like, oh, what?

120
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,040
You mean it?

121
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,500
There's a chance it could be cancer?

122
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:02,080
So, um, because, like, so we're gonna have to do an x-ray first.

123
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,500
Um, let's do an x-ray first to see if there's, like, any, like, lumps or anything.

124
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,740
And then, if there isn't, we'll go right into the CT scan.

125
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:16,700
Um, so, so I was like, oh, my God, I hope it's just the back.

126
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,260
I hope, I hope he broke his back and it's not cancer.

127
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:28,820
Like, um, uh, the doula, yeah, and, so, because I didn't think of that.

128
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,340
I was like, it can be cancer?

129
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,780
Like, I was like, um, um, but, like, it wasn't cancer.

130
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:42,620
It was just a typical wiener dog jumped too hard, jumped too much, um, and broke his back.

131
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,200
Um, not broke it, but, like, he slipped a disc.

132
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:53,760
So, so, basically, what they did was, you know, I was like, do the operation.

133
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,440
Like, they're like, it is pretty expensive.

134
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,020
And I was like, I don't care, just do the surgery.

135
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,580
Because it was, like, a 90 to 98% chance of a recovery.

136
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:08,220
And obviously, like, I like my, I like my odds with the 90% to 98%.

137
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,600
That sounds like really good odds there.

138
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,560
And he was still able to walk.

139
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,340
It's not like he was, like, um, paraplegic coming in.

140
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,300
Like, it's not like he lost the use of his legs coming in.

141
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,040
So, like, he went in, still able to walk.

142
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,080
So, like, there is a higher chance of recovery because of it.

143
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,320
It's not like he did the surgery and then, like, bam, it's worse.

144
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,660
So, like, in my, I hope I was glad it wasn't that.

145
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,460
Um, but obviously, like, um, the first day.

146
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:44,660
Okay, and then, uh, they were telling me he'd have to stay in the hospital an extra day.

147
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,120
Because, like, they want to do, like, a rehabilitation therapy session with him.

148
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,660
So, like, they had to do, like, physical therapy for him.

149
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,820
And, like, making sure, um, uh, I don't, okay?

150
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,480
Hey, you guys wanted me to put the mustache on.

151
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,960
Like, like,

152
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,260
I couldn't take it off to tell the story.

153
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,280
I couldn't.

154
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,960
You guys wanted it on.

155
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:24,160
Anyway, as I was saying, he went in, um, when we, uh, he, they said that he was wobbly, a little worse after the surgery.

156
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,760
But, obviously, like, it wasn't expected.

157
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,700
Because he literally just, they literally cut his back.

158
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,840
They cut his back open and trimmed off, like, this.

159
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,960
Because I didn't realize what type of operation it was.

160
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,980
Like, I don't know what is actually involved.

161
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,220
I got, like, really nervous.

162
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,080
Because they're like, oh, yeah, we took bits of his, like, disc out and everything.

163
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,420
And then I didn't, I didn't realize what was actually happening.

164
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,480
And I was just like, oh, my God, is his spine shorter?

165
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,040
He's like, I thought they were removing stuff.

166
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,800
So I was like, did they, like, shorten him up?

167
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,600
And they're like, no, no, no.

168
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,880
That's not how it works.

169
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:10,740
It's like, we trimmed the, like, basically, parts of the disc, like, grew out, like, improperly.

170
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,760
And, like, grew and slipped.

171
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,340
And then, so...

172
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,320
So we have to trim it.

173
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,940
And that's why his back was, like, slanted.

174
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,780
Because, yeah, I was like, is that what you see?

175
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:32,060
Like, now the size of a regular, like, his length is a regular dog instead of, like, like, instead of a wiener dog?

176
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,380
Because I didn't know, like, a wiener reduction surgery?

177
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,880
Because I didn't know what the surgery implies.

178
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,720
But, no, they just, like, trimmed it.

179
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,680
Trimmed the disc.

180
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,120
Because it was, like, out of line.

181
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,420
So, um, so it was, like, you know, so they had to trim it out.

182
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,800
And stuff that, like, the disc that grew improperly and made it out of line from the spine.

183
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,840
Um, so, so that's what it was.

184
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,280
Like, on a wiener's side, I learned that that day.

185
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,260
I learned what the surgery was.

186
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,320
Because they were like, yeah, the surgery was a success.

187
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,540
I was like, um, is he, like, short?

188
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,200
Like, I literally asked, um, did you, do you make him, like, shorter?

189
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,480
Like, did you shorten?

190
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,360
I literally asked if he, they shortened the spine.

191
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,820
I was like, is he less long now?

192
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,220
Like, because I didn't understand.

193
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,520
Because they're like, yeah, we, like, took out some of the discs.

194
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,660
So, in my head, I was like, my god, is my wiener dog not a wiener anymore?

195
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,000
Anyways, but that's not what happened.

196
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,500
They just trimmed it.

197
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:49,780
And so, basically, he is still... he is wobbly, more wobbly, right now, because it is post-surgery.

198
00:15:50,020 --> 00:16:01,240
So, obviously, that fucking feels weird for him, because it's like, you know, he literally just got his back exposed to the world, and, like, they, like, fucking operated on it.

199
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:08,560
So, he does... it's, like, he does have, like, less... he has more balance issues, but, um...

200
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:26,260
But they said it does... it will get better, and, like, it will improve, and we just need to give him, like, physical therapy and rehabilitation, and make sure that, like, he doesn't jump as much anymore, or at all, which is gonna be very hard, because he doesn't understand that.

201
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,940
Like, he... he... he doesn't know that.

202
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,340
He's... he's like, what?

203
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,420
Less jumping?

204
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,900
What is that?

205
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,540
He wants to be tall.

206
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,660
So, anyway...

207
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,360
Um, what else?

208
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,820
Oh, yeah, and then they, like, gave me a vial...

209
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,680
of, like...

210
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,960
of, like, the disc...

211
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,160
of the...

212
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,840
of the pieces of disc.

213
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,240
And I was, like, you know, they're, like, you don't have to keep it.

214
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,540
And I was, like, oh, no, that's okay.

215
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,100
Because I felt like I was in... on the spot, and I was, like, okay.

216
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,020
So, I... I kept it.

217
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,480
It's in my... it's in my bag.

218
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,720
I haven't, like, taken it out or looked at it.

219
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,700
I feel like... I feel like I should throw it away.

220
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:23,320
But I basically have a vial of liquid and, like, bits of his bone...

221
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,920
like, disc bone...

222
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,460
like, in my bag.

223
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,060
And I was, like, telling my manager about it.

224
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,340
And then...

225
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,880
And then...

226
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,840
Oh, my God.

227
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,000
Dad's fine.

228
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:37,820
Okay.

229
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,140
And then I was telling my manager, I was, like, you know, I could sell...

230
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,800
Okay, it was as a joke.

231
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,400
This was as a joke.

232
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,480
I was, like, I could sell this.

233
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,300
And then...

234
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,640
And then I was, like, oh, wait.

235
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,000
No, I could sign my autograph on the vial.

236
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,120
And...

237
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,020
And then auction it up.

238
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,720
And then my manager was, like, oh, you know what else you can do?

239
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,040
You can sell...

240
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,500
Because there's more than one piece, and there's, like, bits and pieces.

241
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,900
You can buy additional vials.

242
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,040
Divide the pieces out.

243
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,580
So you can maximize your profits.

244
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,800
That's a joke, guys.

245
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,420
It's a joke.

246
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,280
I will not sell pieces of my dog's spine.

247
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,180
To you, guys.

248
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,540
It's a collector's item.

249
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,620
I will get your own piece of dad so you can clone him.

250
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,920
Oh, you can use it to clone your own dad!

251
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,560
Oh, my God.

252
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,720
You guys are so smart.

253
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,160
Oh, my God.

254
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,960
Guys, we...

255
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,080
You guys can clone your own dad with those pieces.

256
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,640
Oh, my God.

257
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,440
Anyway.

258
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,240
I'm not gonna show a picture of it.

259
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,120
Because I think that might be a little too gross.

260
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:14,000
And I don't know if YouTube would like that I showed a vial of pieces of my dog's insides on YouTube.

261
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,180
So I won't show it.

262
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,480
But yes, he...

263
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,520
I will show you a video of...

264
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,120
Okay, by the way.

265
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
They obviously had to shave a...

266
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,380
Shave a spot.

267
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,540
Clone the dog with the most genetic issues you've ever heard of.

268
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,980
Many, thank you for the super chat.

269
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,100
Thank you, thank you.

270
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,380
Robin's mustache.

271
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,200
Thank you for the super chat.

272
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,780
Thank you, thank you.

273
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,180
I bet they go for more than a piece of paper, dude.

274
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,360
Thank you for the super chat.

275
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,320
Thank you, thank you.

276
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:41,920
Anyway.

277
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:49,860
But, so for the surgery, obviously, they had to shave the back to, like, you know, operate on.

278
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:56,380
Um, so, like, I didn't... Okay, so, I was really worried because they asked me to visit...

279
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,760
They said I could visit him at any time before I picked him up for discharge.

280
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:06,080
But, like, I got really scared because, like, I didn't visit him, like, the two days.

281
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,600
Uh, because I got really scared that he was gonna get too excited and, like, was gonna, like...

282
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,940
Like, I didn't want him to move, so I didn't visit him because I was really scared.

283
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:22,880
And then the dog sitter also didn't visit because, like, they were also really scared that he was gonna get too excited.

284
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,240
And, like, obviously, like, open his wounds and stuff.

285
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,480
So, but then when I saw him during the discharge, um...

286
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,120
Because it was obviously, like, you know, I didn't want him to, like, break his back again.

287
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,640
Like, that was what I was most scared of.

288
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:49,220
And when we were... when we picked him up for the discharge, he was just, like, shaking a lot.

289
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,560
And I was so worried.

290
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,900
I was like, is that normal?

291
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,780
And then the vet was like, yeah, he's just really, really excited.

292
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,380
So that's why he's just shaking with excitement.

293
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,240
So I was just like, oh, my God.

294
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,580
And then I saw, like, his naked back.

295
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,760
And I was like, oh, my... And, like, there's, you know, obviously there's a line on where the spine is.

296
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,980
And I was like, oh, my God.

297
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,020
You're even more involved.

298
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,080
It's just like... I mean, I can show a video.

299
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:23,260
I do have a video that the dog sitter sent me of the...

300
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,280
Okay, let's see.

301
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,160
I do have a video that the dog sitter sent me of him using the bathroom.

302
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,220
If you guys want... But he is wobbly.

303
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,680
Like, it was basically today's update.

304
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,780
If you guys want to see it, you want to see Dad.

305
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,560
But he is... He is a little wobbly.

306
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,260
He is wobbly.

307
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,320
You can tell he is wobbly.

308
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,520
But he is recovering.

309
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,260
But yeah, let me grab it real quick.

310
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,740
But he is recovering, guys.

311
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,860
He might be wobbly, but he is getting better.

312
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,940
All right, let me find it real quick.

313
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,240
Where is it?

314
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:55,720
Oh, right now?

315
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,540
Okay, give me a second.

316
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,640
I need to download it.

317
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,500
I sent it to myself.

318
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,460
I forgot to... I forgot to download the video.

319
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,520
All right, nice.

320
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:03,900
All right.

321
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,600
It's too... I might be a bit too loud, though.

322
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,780
Uh...

323
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,120
Whoops.

324
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,160
Here's the video.

325
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:12,960
All right.

326
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,500
There he is.

327
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,440
You can tell that...

328
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,000
That's...

329
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,100
That's not a band-aid, by the way.

330
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,040
That's...

331
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,640
That's not...

332
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,100
That's not a...

333
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,700
That's not a band-aid.

334
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,160
That's literally...

335
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,660
It's like a patch of...

336
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,980
A patch of fur that's gone.

337
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,880
Like...

338
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,180
It's just...

339
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,860
That's the skin, guys.

340
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,420
I know when I saw the video, I was like...

341
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,000
I was like, oh my god.

342
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,600
That's...

343
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,440
That's the bald spot where they had to...

344
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,780
You know, shave off and then...

345
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,980
Cut that part of the spine open...

346
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,200
The skin open.

347
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,740
But you can tell that he is...

348
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,560
He is a little wobbly.

349
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,240
But, like...

350
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,400
You can tell that he is, like...

351
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,560
A little uncoordinated.

352
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,080
But...

353
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,620
But he's...

354
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,800
He's doing a lot better.

355
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:58,540
He...

356
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,680
We're not bullying him!

357
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,880
We're not...

358
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:07,800
He...

359
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,900
It's just like...

360
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,960
He's, like, a little drunk.

361
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,680
But, like...

362
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,760
It's just that...

363
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,980
Obviously, he just got operated on...

364
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,460
Like, a few days ago.

365
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,940
But, um...

366
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,680
He is...

367
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,460
He is recovering.

368
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,900
And, um...

369
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,340
He's on a lot of meds, too.

370
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,120
There's also the fact that...

371
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,100
The textures didn't load properly.

372
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,040
Okay.

373
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,040
Oh, I forgot to mention...

374
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,580
He is incredibly drugged up right now.

375
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
He's on...

376
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,040
He is on...

377
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,520
Four different medications.

378
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,340
Um...

379
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:42,820
And...

380
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,100
So, he has, like...

381
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,500
Like...

382
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,380
Several, like...

383
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,260
Painkillers.

384
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,640
Muscle relaxant.

385
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,780
Um...

386
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,600
Two other types of, like...

387
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,840
He's on...

388
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,220
Yeah.

389
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,800
So, there's also...

390
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,760
There's also that.

391
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,380
He's on...

392
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,940
Four different...

393
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,980
Fucking medication.

394
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,420
To deal with everything.

395
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,400
Um...

396
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,980
And he has to take them, like...

397
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,700
Um...

398
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,940
Three times a day.

399
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,000
Three times a day.

400
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,600
So, you guys can see why...

401
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,320
The dog sitter is taking care of him right now.

402
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,160
Instead of me.

403
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,200
Because...

404
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,520
I have...

405
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,600
Unfortunately, have...

406
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,540
A very busy work schedule.

407
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,100
Especially for this month.

408
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,020
And next month.

409
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:19,820
So...

410
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,620
Or for, like...

411
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:20,740
Yeah.

412
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,660
For April and May.

413
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,880
I unfortunately have, like...

414
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,080
A really busy work schedule.

415
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,000
So...

416
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,900
I can't supervise him...

417
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,620
24-7.

418
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,540
Um...

419
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,660
Because of it.

420
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,540
Because...

421
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,260
Like, you know...

422
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,120
With what he's going through...

423
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,440
He needs 24-7 care.

424
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,780
And I'm very lucky that...

425
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,260
The dog sitter and, like...

426
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,500
Because, like, their entire family is taking care of...

427
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:40,860
Uh...

428
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,620
Dad right now.

429
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:42,880
And...

430
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,560
And obviously, they're supervising him.

431
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,540
Um...

432
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,480
They're supervising him.

433
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,560
Making sure that he's okay.

434
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,480
He's in this little crate thing.

435
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,260
Um...

436
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,620
Where he just sits there the whole day.

437
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,640
Um...

438
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,220
But yes...

439
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,480
The care is expensive.

440
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,560
But it's worth it.

441
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:56,940
Uh...

442
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,240
You might notice that...

443
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,600
Uh...

444
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,760
You might notice that...

445
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,300
Um...

446
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,080
We are going to be taking at least one sponsor per week.

447
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,080
Um...

448
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,040
The next couple of weeks.

449
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,380
Because, like I said...

450
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,260
Because, like I said...

451
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,080
Like I said...

452
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,020
It was technically more than $10,000.

453
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,460
Um...

454
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,520
Because the surgery alone was $10,000.

455
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,620
So...

456
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,380
That...

457
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,500
That didn't include, like...

458
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,720
The scans...

459
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,160
And the...

460
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,840
And the hospital visit...

461
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,440
And the...

462
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,220
Staying at the hospital.

463
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,380
So...

464
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:30,780
It was...

465
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,940
But I'm really thankful...

466
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,220
For your support, guys.

467
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,040
Um...

468
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,920
To help me be able to afford...

469
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,820
The surgery.

470
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:38,900
And everything.

471
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:39,620
So...

472
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,960
If it wasn't for you guys...

473
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,140
For supporting me...

474
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,420
And supporting...

475
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,460
Doki Amber Doge.

476
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:44,920
Um...

477
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,480
We can...

478
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,620
We are able to afford the surgery.

479
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,940
And, you know...

480
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,680
I am taking these extra sponsors...

481
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,660
To help pad out...

482
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:51,920
You know...

483
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,700
My finances.

484
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,380
Or the fact that...

485
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:54,640
Um...

486
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,840
I have to pay for the dog sitter...

487
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,320
And, like...

488
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,860
Obviously...

489
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,140
To make up for the funds...

490
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,460
That I used...

491
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,500
For his care...

492
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,540
Because he decided...

493
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,180
Genetically...

494
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,760
That he wasn't gonna follow...

495
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,140
His genetic destiny...

496
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,040
Even though, like...

497
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,640
He should've.

498
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,160
I remember, like...

499
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,720
The hospital vet...

500
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,240
Was like...

501
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,660
The doctor was like...

502
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,320
Okay, so...

503
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,940
You gotta make sure he doesn't do this...

504
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,560
And that...

505
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,160
And that...

506
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,860
For his recovery...

507
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,760
And then...

508
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,520
The dog sitter...

509
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:20,800
Because, like...

510
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,820
The dog sitter was with me...

511
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,260
He was with me during...

512
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:23,980
Throughout it...

513
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,720
And he was like...

514
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,380
Did you tell...

515
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,640
Did you tell Doki that?

516
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:26,960
Like...

517
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,860
Did you tell Dad that?

518
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,560
Um...

519
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,280
Because, obviously...

520
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,860
I named him after myself...

521
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:33,980
Um...

522
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,120
But he was like...

523
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,100
Did you tell...

524
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,380
Did you tell the dog that?

525
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,460
And then...

526
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:38,840
Because...

527
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,340
And he was like...

528
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,080
He's very stubborn...

529
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,300
Um...

530
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,480
Um...

531
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:46,960
But yeah...

532
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,740
CyberDragal...

533
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,500
Thank you for that...

534
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,460
AlkaSupa...

535
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:49,780
Thank you...

536
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,260
Thank you for that...

537
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,120
Thank you again.

538
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,260
Solid snake.

539
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,100
Thank you for the superchat.

540
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,420
Thank you.

541
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,200
Anything.

542
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,040
For the goodness boy and dad.

543
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,860
Thank you for the superchat.

544
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,140
Thank you.

545
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:58,540
Thank you.

546
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,580
Oh, OK.

547
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,360
Now I'm just... I wish I was...

548
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,280
Thank you for the superchat.

549
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:04,860
Thank you.

550
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,620
Thank you.

551
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:13,380
But yeah, that's the current life update regarding his care.

552
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:20,280
I'm going to be... I do get regular updates every day on how he's doing as well as videos and photos.

553
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:26,120
I'm planning on like visiting him too, whenever I'm free from work or like behind the scenes stuff.

554
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,220
But yeah, he's doing great.

555
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:40,160
Thank you for everybody that sent him well wishes and that were wondering if he's okay and was like wondering about like, you know, his updates on like after his surgery and everything.

556
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:45,260
I really appreciate everybody for caring so much about him as much as I care about him as well.

557
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,460
So thank you guys.

558
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,740
Anyway, um, another life update.

559
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,280
Another life update.

560
00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:07,540
Um, next week on Sunday, I will be checking out the early... I was invited to check out the early access for the new Apex character and Apex season.

561
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,980
So they invite... Respawn has invited me to check out the early access next week.

562
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,180
It is going to be on Sunday because that's when it starts.

563
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:22,720
Because usually I don't, you know, usually, um, I don't post the schedule out, um, until then.

564
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,540
I'm doing my one too.

565
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,120
I'll do it on YouTube and then, um, because it is two days and apparently there are special drops for it.

566
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:37,320
I might do, maybe I'll do the next one on, I'll do another stream on, on Monday as a bonus on Twitch because there are special drops for this event.

567
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,580
Um, but I will tweet about it later as well.

568
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,660
So I'll be back on, it's been a while.

569
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,500
I will say it has been a while.

570
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,720
Since I've, um, played Apex.

571
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:58,880
I remember during the, during my convention at St. Louis, um, some guy at the panel asked me what I feel about Sierra.

572
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,160
And like, I need stories I want to talk about Sierra.

573
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,480
And then I was like, oh buddy, I don't know if you know this, but we're on the Marvel Rivals ground.

574
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:26,280
I was like, let me check when was the last time I, I, I played Apex and I looked at my, you know, play history and the last time I've opened the game, I don't know about playing the game, but the last time I opened the game was March 10th.

575
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,400
So like...

576
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:36,340
So I was like, oh buddy, that's, uh, you're a little too late for him to ask me that.

577
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,860
To ask me about Sierra, cause I don't know what the fuck is going on.

578
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,740
But yes, I'm not sponsored to do so.

579
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,120
Um, they just sent me an invite to check out the new season.

580
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:54,020
And, you know, obviously I would, um, I love to have that opportunity, um, to do so.

581
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:02,320
So like, of course I said yes, because like, you know, it's a special invite and I wanted, I, it's been a while since I looked into Apex in a long time.

582
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:10,160
And I'm, I'm hyped to see like what, what they're gonna, what changes there are, what's the new characters gonna be like and everything.

583
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,320
Cause you know, it's nice to check out new characters and stuff and see like what they do.

584
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,600
So that's gonna be on Sunday.

585
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,060
I don't know what the time is, cause like, I didn't fully read my briefing.

586
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,100
Jeff, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

587
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,540
Is it tax deductible if I mark this super chat as to add some medical care?

588
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,760
But seriously, hope he gets better, thank you, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

589
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,760
You know, like, um, I recently got, I'm doing a, okay, so you know how I'm doing the, what was it, girls?

590
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,320
Wait, what was, I, I, I don't remember the full name.

591
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,840
The girls battlefront, was that?

592
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,580
Oh my gosh.

593
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:52,760
It's okay, today's not the sponsored day, so I can butcher it a little bit, cause I'm not, technically I'm not sponsored yet.

594
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,380
Girls front line, I was almost right.

595
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,080
Girls front line too.

596
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:06,620
And then, um, and then, uh, oh wait, no, it wasn't for that.

597
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,360
Oh, nevermind.

598
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,080
I did read the briefing for it.

599
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,060
Um, but it wasn't the one that was, like, super long.

600
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,960
So, I'm, I'm doing a sponsor, a different sponsor in two weeks.

601
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:23,140
Um, this one I am looking forward to, because, um, it's always, it's a sponsor I never expected to get.

602
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,960
Um, but I was super excited.

603
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,500
Um, because it was, it's a game that I used to play a lot.

604
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,880
That, just a little hint of what that sponsor could be.

605
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,380
Um, um, so, they sent me a briefing.

606
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,040
And then, um, I was like, I just told my manager.

607
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,540
I was like, oh yeah, no, take the sponsor.

608
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,720
Like, that's, that, take it.

609
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,040
Like, I don't, this also helps with paying off the, the surgery.

610
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:59,200
And then, and then, um, my manager was like, did you read the briefing?

611
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,160
And I was like, no.

612
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,540
And then, my manager was like, it's 20 pages.

613
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,540
They're like, you're gonna take it, but he didn't.

614
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,540
I was like, oh.

615
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,160
I was like, I was like, 20 pages.

616
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:17,900
Oh, shit.

617
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,180
Um, I was like, okay.

618
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,700
I can, I'll, I'll read it.

619
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,020
I swear, I'll read it.

620
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,280
Okay.

621
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,040
I swear.

622
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,520
I'll read the contract.

623
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,220
I'll read the briefing.

624
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,380
Yeah, I was not expecting 20 pages of info.

625
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,060
I just, I just thought, that's a cool sponsor.

626
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:39,720
Take it.

627
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,600
Anyway.

628
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,460
Okay, I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick.

629
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
I'll be right back, guys.

630
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,200
You listen to the music while, when I'm gone.

631
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,780
I'm back for real now.

632
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,460
All right.

633
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,780
Hello, everybody.

634
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,820
Oh.

635
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,800
Let me make sure that everything is okay.

636
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,740
I'm gonna put that up here.

637
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,520
All right, guys.

638
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:22,900
All right.

639
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,020
So, that is the entire life update so far.

640
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,520
So, yeah.

641
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,780
There's a lot of stuff coming up.

642
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,140
A lot of sponsors.

643
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:36,560
There's, there is another, there is a Tokyo Alley convention, which is in Australia, for those who are, those who are from Australian goons.

644
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:40,140
You guys can see me at Australia for Tokyo Alley.

645
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,080
And then there's FanimeCon, which was, is also in May, which is a huge convention there.

646
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,840
And I believe the meet and greets are, I think the meet and greets are free for it.

647
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,520
I think you just have to line up, I believe.

648
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,140
I'm not sure.

649
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,220
I'm not 100% sure.

650
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,020
But, like, you know, I could be lying.

651
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,940
I could be lying.

652
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,240
I should read this more properly.

653
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,880
May or may not be free.

654
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:15,680
Um, but, I am accepting, accepting gifts for both Tokyo Alley and FanimeCon.

655
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,680
Um, so yeah.

656
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,720
Just, uh, free with exceptions.

657
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:20,680
Um.

658
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,340
Maybe I should read it better.

659
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,180
Read my stuff better.

660
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,720
Um, it was a pleasure for you to hear you again at Anime in St. Louis.

661
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,360
I've been working on my ROAR.

662
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,260
Thank you for the super chat.

663
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,280
Thank you, thank you.

664
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,640
I got you in the front.

665
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:45,700
I heard you, like, lined up for 2.5 hours or something for at Anime St. Louis to be, like, a really good seat.

666
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,160
But then you're like, wait, I could have just, like, sat in the front.

667
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,780
Ha ha ha ha ha.

668
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,840
Ha ha ha ha ha.

669
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,360
That's a, that's a feels bad.

670
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,060
Ha ha ha.

671
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,180
But I'm glad you still enjoyed it.

672
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,580
I'm, I'm glad you had a great time.

673
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,440
Um, at Anime St. Louis.

674
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,020
Um.

675
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,880
I wish I did sing more for this.

676
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,280
I didn't know.

677
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,580
It was supposed to be karaoke.

678
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,320
Mostly just karaoke.

679
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,800
But, um.

680
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,800
Um, obviously, you know, like, the timing was very unfortunate with everything that was going on, you know, with my dog and everything.

681
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,020
So I asked the convention people if it was okay if I make it, like, half a Q&A panel and half karaoke.

682
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,180
And they said it was fine.

683
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,760
Like, you know, during the circumstances.

684
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,920
And, like, I was like, sorry, guys.

685
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,080
Like, I'm still gonna sing.

686
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,800
It's just that my voice is, like, not the best at the moment at that time.

687
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,740
Um, you know, I was all over the place that day.

688
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,380
Like, the last couple of days for it.

689
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,920
So I'm glad a lot of people still enjoyed, uh, still enjoyed Anime St. Louis.

690
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,540
Um, and had a great time.

691
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,960
That's their very first VTuber guest.

692
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,200
Anyway, let's play the game!

693
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,560
I forgot where I was at this part.

694
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,420
Um, where, where did I progress as Mario?

695
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,400
Mario!

696
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,340
Alright.

697
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,120
I guess I have to go to the world too.

698
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,180
Did I talk to everybody?

699
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,360
Did I talk to everyone here?

700
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,440
I think so.

701
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,460
I'll just go forward.

702
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,040
I don't know.

703
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,040
Oh, yeah!

704
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:08,820
Oh, I remembered!

705
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,500
I remembered!

706
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:09,880
Okay.

707
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,300
So, there's a lot of bullets here that wanna kill me.

708
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,540
I remember now.

709
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,420
And then I, yeah, and I killed this guy.

710
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,000
And did I kill him?

711
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,220
I don't remember if I killed him.

712
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,440
Yeah.

713
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,040
Oh, wait!

714
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,720
Do I have Toadie?

715
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,420
No, I don't!

716
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:24,540
Toadie!

717
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:26,780
Alright.

718
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,060
Let's see.

719
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,940
Um, okay, I'll do Spark first.

720
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,240
I don't know if Spark's gonna kill him.

721
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,000
Okay, nevermind.

722
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,420
I forgot he's flying.

723
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,180
Hahaha!

724
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,320
I forgot!

725
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,040
Electricity!

726
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:41,780
Bad!

727
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,080
Hahaha!

728
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,320
Oh, look!

729
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,340
It's been a while!

730
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,840
I don't remember my type advantages, okay?

731
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,560
You're on the... Oh, nice.

732
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:55,920
Nice.

733
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,560
Rewind time.

734
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,540
I killed your sister.

735
00:39:59,760 --> 00:39:59,940
Okay.

736
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,980
And it's... Okay, fighting is also bad.

737
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,620
I remembered.

738
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,760
Birds can't fight or use electricity.

739
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:07,860
Alright.

740
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,400
Okay, I still killed him.

741
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:10,640
Okay.

742
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,600
Hahaha!

743
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,200
Hahaha!

744
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,300
Okay, look.

745
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,900
I might be a little too strong.

746
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,040
I might be a little...

747
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,160
Asking once again to be Goonified for it.

748
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,340
Thank you for the super chat.

749
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,540
Wait, I don't need Leech Seed.

750
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,240
That's not an attack move.

751
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,540
Yeah, no.

752
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,020
Wait.

753
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,280
No, I won't stop learning.

754
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,500
Le... No.

755
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,120
Okay, yes.

756
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,840
We do not learn Leech Seed.

757
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,200
And then we do this.

758
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,160
Yay!

759
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,900
Alright.

760
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:42,540
Don't worry.

761
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,700
We have another...

762
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,320
Oh, shit.

763
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,980
Oh, no.

764
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:47,520
You know what?

765
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,100
Fuck it.

766
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,640
Let's just kill him for XP.

767
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,380
This is your...

768
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,320
This is your job.

769
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,240
You're just here for XP.

770
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:57,740
All right.

771
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,580
Get out of here.

772
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:01,560
Nice.

773
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,360
You're right.

774
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,200
I should start...

775
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,620
I should send out...

776
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:05,880
Wait.

777
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,940
Can I go through here?

778
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,900
Did I go through here yet?

779
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,800
I don't remember.

780
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,880
Were you lost here?

781
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:12,780
Oh, yeah.

782
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,720
I did went through here.

783
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,920
Yeah, I did go through here.

784
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,520
Guys, it's been a while.

785
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,820
I lose track of things.

786
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,960
Oh, I found a one-up mushroom.

787
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,420
Hello, fight me.

788
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,120
Check out my sick party, Mario.

789
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,200
Yeah?

790
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,920
How sick is it?

791
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,940
What the fuck?

792
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,500
A bully?

793
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,880
Oh, wait.

794
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,600
That's in Mario 64.

795
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,760
I remember him.

796
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,200
All right.

797
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:40,720
Get here.

798
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,500
Get firefighting.

799
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,520
I already have a...

800
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,680
I already have a red one.

801
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,940
I want you another one.

802
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,220
Oh, shit.

803
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,520
I don't even know my type advantages, but I got it right.

804
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,800
Oh, you got withdraw...

805
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,860
Oh, you're a coward.

806
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,540
Oh, look.

807
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,240
It's Tootie.

808
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,500
Don't worry.

809
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,020
I've killed your brothers and sisters.

810
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,940
I can kill them again.

811
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,360
Oh, wait.

812
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:01,820
Never mind.

813
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,100
Wait.

814
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,660
Fighting is good...

815
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,680
Is bad against...

816
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,880
I don't remember.

817
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,140
It's been so many years.

818
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,360
I can't remember the type advantages.

819
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,740
It's been too long.

820
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,000
I don't understand.

821
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,040
Why is fighting bad against birds?

822
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,920
What the fuck is the bird gonna do?

823
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,640
Have you ever punched a bird?

824
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,840
I can if they stop flying away.

825
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,660
It's really hard to punch...

826
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,040
Punch a bird.

827
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,100
I don't believe it.

828
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:42,940
I need...

829
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,320
I...

830
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,780
Great boy.

831
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,280
I...

832
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,900
If I...

833
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,300
Oh, wait.

834
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:48,920
Wait.

835
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:49,940
Is this...

836
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,940
It's a ghost mouse.

837
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,180
So...

838
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:52,260
Wait.

839
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,240
Electricity doesn't work on...

840
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:54,900
Ghosts?

841
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,300
I can't...

842
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,160
Why doesn't electricity work on ghosts?

843
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,120
Oh my god.

844
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,140
I'm so confused.

845
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,060
Dad, wake up!

846
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,520
Oh, it does.

847
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,740
Why didn't it say it fell?

848
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,000
Wait.

849
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,660
Are you a ground ghost?

850
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,180
Okay.

851
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:17,540
It's okay.

852
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,760
I have another type.

853
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:20,440
Yeah.

854
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,540
But fighting didn't work.

855
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,700
Oh, it might be ground ghost.

856
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:24,720
The fuck?

857
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,620
How is a mouse...

858
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,820
How is a mouse ground?

859
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,480
It floats.

860
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,980
I'm so confused.

861
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,560
The confused rate also hurt me.

862
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,300
Have you tried punching a ghost before?

863
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:41,900
Yeah.

864
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,680
Punched me.

865
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,940
She didn't phase through it.

866
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,560
Weren't they cool?

867
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,600
I mean...

868
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,180
Darn you, Mario.

869
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,280
Alright.

870
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,460
Maybe I should.

871
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,820
Oh my god.

872
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,000
Wait.

873
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:01,900
I did not heal.

874
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:06,260
I came out of the Pokemon Center and I didn't even use the...

875
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,080
I didn't even...

876
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:08,720
Okay.

877
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,800
That's a little awkward.

878
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:14,780
I like literally came out of the Pokemon Center and didn't even use it.

879
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,160
Whoops.

880
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:16,980
Whoopsie.

881
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,760
That's awkward.

882
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,060
Alright.

883
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,400
Let's take...

884
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,380
Go back so we can at least heal...

885
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:23,720
Oh, baby.

886
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,420
Thank you for that.

887
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,100
Get the ship.

888
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:25,480
Thank you.

889
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,080
Thank you.

890
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,560
So at least we can heal the dragon and catch a toady.

891
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Just to complete my Pokedex.

892
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,500
Or my...

893
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,640
Tattle Dex.

894
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:36,860
Alright.

895
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,040
Get in here.

896
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,320
Or my Tattle Dex.

897
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,340
What is it even called?

898
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,000
This isn't...

899
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,620
This isn't called a Pokemon Center, right?

900
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,280
What do they call it?

901
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:48,840
The CC?

902
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,640
The fuck is a CC?

903
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,620
Command Center?

904
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:53,900
Alright.

905
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:54,920
Is it...

906
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,620
No, it's...

907
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,420
I'm pretty sure it...

908
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,420
Yeah, it's a Tattle Dex.

909
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,180
Alright.

910
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,440
Now I have to do this all over.

911
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:00,740
Wait.

912
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,620
Do I have to do...

913
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,160
Yeah, I do.

914
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:02,900
God damn it.

915
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,100
I'll do this part all over again.

916
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,100
It's so far away.

917
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,320
Uh...

918
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,560
The calm...

919
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,280
The capsule core.

920
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,240
Whoa!

921
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,460
Tuck Puff!

922
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,760
What are you?

923
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,640
You seem rather tough.

924
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,060
Alright.

925
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:21,820
Let's put...

926
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,180
Dragon in here.

927
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,260
I don't have...

928
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,020
Yeah, I don't have him because there's no Pokeball on it.

929
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,580
It's a cloud!

930
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:31,980
Why is it yellow?

931
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,600
I don't like that it's yellow.

932
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,580
It makes me uncomfortable.

933
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,100
Don't worry.

934
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,360
Time to lick the cloud.

935
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,340
Ha ha ha!

936
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,820
That's like the only move I'll ever use.

937
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,800
Lick the cloud, Dragon!

938
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:45,560
Ha ha ha!

939
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,680
Lick it!

940
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,220
That's right.

941
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,720
You know you like it.

942
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:50,780
You know.

943
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,540
Ha ha ha!

944
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,920
Ha ha ha!

945
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,480
Keep licking.

946
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:57,740
Ha ha ha!

947
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,340
You lick the cloud.

948
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,180
He's doing his best.

949
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,100
Good job, Dragon!

950
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,780
Know your place.

951
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,260
Ha ha ha!

952
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,840
Ha ha ha!

953
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,300
Please.

954
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:11,620
Wait.

955
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,960
It contains my cotton candy.

956
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,440
Nice.

957
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,140
Forbidden cotton candy.

958
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,640
Not so dead, but...

959
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,380
Thank you for the super chat.

960
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:24,820
Thank you.

961
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,400
Thank you.

962
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:29,700
Doki can revamp the ghost adventure shows with her ghost punching abilities.

963
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:30,860
Yay!

964
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,340
Alright.

965
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:34,840
A cloud of...

966
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,280
Thank you, yes!

967
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,720
It suffocates its enemies by forcing itself onto their face.

968
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,960
But enemies will often pass out due to their smell instead.

969
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,060
Damn, Dragon.

970
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,220
You a freak.

971
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,360
You a...

972
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,940
Ha ha ha!

973
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,160
Who wanted it?

974
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,060
Was it fo-r?

975
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:52,580
Alright.

976
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,340
Fo-goon.

977
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:55,720
Oh, wait.

978
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,640
I spelled it wrong.

979
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:57,600
Um.

980
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:04,480
Fo- Fo- Fo- A-goon.

981
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,140
There.

982
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:06,900
You can beat...

983
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,140
You can beat a fart cloud.

984
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,460
A-goon.

985
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

986
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,240
Lick the cloud.

987
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:14,620
Wait.

988
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:14,980
Oh, wait.

989
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,020
That's not what I want to do.

990
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:16,400
No.

991
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:16,660
Okay.

992
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,720
We gotta get out of here.

993
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:18,680
Oh, hey.

994
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:18,980
Yeah.

995
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,240
Let's just kill him.

996
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:23,740
We throw...

997
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,100
We...

998
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,740
We do like...

999
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,840
We do a grab move on the cloud.

1000
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,520
Nice.

1001
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,060
It doesn't matter if it's not effective or not.

1002
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:34,860
He's still dead.

1003
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,160
We're gonna punch the cloud.

1004
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,840
Okay, I forgot to do this.

1005
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,940
Alright, nice.

1006
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,340
We need to get Toadie in here.

1007
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:47,740
Whoops!

1008
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,280
Where's Toadie?

1009
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,100
Goddammit, they're all Tough Puffs!

1010
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,840
Yeah, I'm pretty sure Tough Puff...

1011
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,620
I mean, Tough Puff is an actual Mario enemy.

1012
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,100
I've never seen it before.

1013
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,400
Maybe from the newer games?

1014
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,000
Alright, goodbye Tough Puff.

1015
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:08,640
Yay!

1016
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,800
That's not a fighting move.

1017
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,540
Yes, stop learning.

1018
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,840
Wait, you want to swallow?

1019
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,040
Yes.

1020
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,920
Guys, I know, like, we don't have Stockpiled.

1021
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,540
But, like, I just...

1022
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,060
Wait...

1023
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:40,000
We don't even have Stockpiled.

1024
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,520
It's not worthless!

1025
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,800
You can swallow!

1026
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,700
It's not worthless, guys.

1027
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:46,420
Wait!

1028
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:49,760
Okay!

1029
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,520
There's no way!

1030
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,540
There's no way this wasn't planned.

1031
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,420
Alright.

1032
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,240
Aw, man.

1033
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,060
Did we swallow or...

1034
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:01,600
No.

1035
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,360
Wait, now we just need spit.

1036
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,920
There's no way that wasn't intentional.

1037
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:08,880
No.

1038
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,260
It's worthless without...

1039
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,580
Stock doesn't matter.

1040
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,700
I want to have choices.

1041
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,760
I want to be able to pick.

1042
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,100
No name.

1043
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,240
Thank you for the super chat.

1044
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:27,660
Thank you.

1045
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,160
Thank you.

1046
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:34,580
Imagine Pokemon, but you're ducking people off the streets like a mailman or McDonald's employee and make them cage fight.

1047
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,580
Thank you for the super chat.

1048
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,280
Thank you, thank you.

1049
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,280
I mean, this is pretty much it.

1050
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:39,900
Yeah.

1051
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,820
Sydney Cookie, thank you for the super chat.

1052
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,740
Thank you, thank you.

1053
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,820
Since Minus Green, she can dress up as Luigi and you can dress up as Mario Dokey.

1054
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,860
Thank you, thank you for the super chat.

1055
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:48,860
Thank you, thank you.

1056
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:49,500
Alright.

1057
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,320
The only move I need is...

1058
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,480
I don't need a bubble.

1059
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,000
The only move I need is lick.

1060
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,700
Oh my... Dragoon.

1061
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,380
You guys are... Oh shit, I got shot at too.

1062
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:13,540
Damn.

1063
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,560
You guys are freaky, Dragoon.

1064
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:22,740
Swallow, spit, lick, and bite?

1065
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,840
That's one freaky, Dragoon right there.

1066
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,980
No, it's not very...

1067
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,760
They're like the most common shiny.

1068
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,220
What have we learned?

1069
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,180
Okay, I think that...

1070
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,520
Honestly, I think this is my favorite...

1071
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,100
My favorite title Pokemon.

1072
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,840
Or Mario-mon.

1073
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:52,000
Swallow, lick, spit, up, bite...

1074
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,240
That's you!

1075
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,240
That's you, guys!

1076
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:57,660
Look!

1077
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,640
Point at you!

1078
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,120
That's you!

1079
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,220
You guys...

1080
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:02,800
I didn't...

1081
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,000
You guys wanted to learn these moves, chat.

1082
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,280
You wanted to learn them.

1083
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:16,920
Alright.

1084
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,680
Oh my god, and she's female.

1085
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,220
It's just perfect.

1086
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,880
It's perfect.

1087
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,320
Why would I deny you of your...

1088
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,680
Why would I deny you guys...

1089
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,040
Of your purpose in life?

1090
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,380
Can't follow the rules if you don't play the game.

1091
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,780
Wait, but you're fighting me.

1092
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,080
You're playing the game.

1093
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,260
Yeah, would face like that ever lie to you?

1094
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:40,880
Exactly.

1095
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:45,900
Wait.

1096
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,060
He's sending his own, like, people to fight me.

1097
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,140
Wait, that's pretty fucked if you think about it.

1098
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,280
Don't worry.

1099
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:54,480
I'm gonna do a vital throw.

1100
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,920
You guys getting a shell?

1101
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,100
What the fuck is your shell gonna do about this?

1102
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,420
I'm still gonna throw you into the ocean.

1103
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,240
We're up in the sky.

1104
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,280
I can literally throw you out...

1105
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,160
Throw you down and hit you...

1106
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:07,940
Hit the ground.

1107
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,040
Delta!

1108
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,380
Anyway, can I get a happy birthday?

1109
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,940
I am not reading your first sentence.

1110
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,500
Thank you for the super chat, Delta.

1111
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:20,440
Thank you.

1112
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,060
Thank you.

1113
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,100
Happy birthday to you.

1114
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,200
Happy birthday to you.

1115
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,240
Happy birthday, dear Delta.

1116
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,980
Happy birthday to you.

1117
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:30,380
Yeah!

1118
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,320
Happy birthday!

1119
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,060
Woo!

1120
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,000
All right.

1121
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,520
Let's get rid of...

1122
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,040
What's the weakest?

1123
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,380
Okay, clamp's the weakest.

1124
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:38,680
So get rid of clamp.

1125
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,680
Eevee, welcome to tomato farm.

1126
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,600
Welcome, welcome.

1127
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,720
D-Dragon, thank you for the super chat.

1128
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,740
Thank you, thank you.

1129
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,900
Why would Doki give this money to a baby?

1130
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,360
He's not a baby.

1131
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,360
He's level 17.

1132
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,840
He's at least a teenager.

1133
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,240
All right.

1134
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,460
I'm gonna throw you off the cliff.

1135
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,500
We're so high up here.

1136
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,880
You'll never live.

1137
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,860
Oh my god, this takes so long.

1138
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:14,900
Get out of here.

1139
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,680
We're up in the sky.

1140
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,820
I'm gonna kick you out of the sky.

1141
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,180
Doki, that's still not good.

1142
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,640
But he's not a baby, though.

1143
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:27,720
All right.

1144
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,020
Sport ball.

1145
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,340
Thank you for the super chat.

1146
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,520
Thank you, thank you.

1147
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,420
Help me, Doki.

1148
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,540
The maple leaves are collapsing again.

1149
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:37,100
Again.

1150
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,260
Why do the hockey gods hate Toronto?

1151
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,080
Thank you for the super chat.

1152
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:42,920
Thank you, thank you.

1153
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,440
As long as there's no revolts after, then it should be good, right?

1154
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,820
That's the only thing I know about hockey.

1155
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:50,760
The riots.

1156
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,200
People go crazy.

1157
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,800
Thank you for the super chat.

1158
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:56,820
Thank you, thank you.

1159
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:58,900
All right.

1160
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:01,400
Wait, what do you want to learn?

1161
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:01,900
Bite?

1162
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,000
Oh, you want to be a freak, too.

1163
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,300
All right.

1164
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,640
Bite with...

1165
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,320
Functions differently for ghosts.

1166
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,240
Wait, are you a ghost?

1167
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,800
Okay, bite...

1168
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,720
Uh...

1169
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,120
Bite.

1170
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:15,500
Okay.

1171
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,200
We don't need bite.

1172
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,860
That's not an attack move.

1173
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,180
Only attacks here.

1174
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,280
Nice.

1175
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,080
We got $220.

1176
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,680
Give me your fucking money.

1177
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,420
What happened?

1178
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,520
What does this do?

1179
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,280
Oh, it's for that.

1180
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,180
Okay, we gotta go all the way across, then.

1181
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,040
Oh.

1182
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:39,820
Hello?

1183
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:39,860
Hello?

1184
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,400
Hey, hey.

1185
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,500
It's quite odd out here, isn't it, Marigo?

1186
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,060
One can say it's spiky.

1187
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:51,790
All right.

1188
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:53,450
We gotta kill our spotting now.

1189
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:55,190
All right, Dad.

1190
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:58,250
I only know one move and one move only.

1191
00:54:59,130 --> 00:54:59,770
All right.

1192
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:01,110
I know two moves.

1193
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:02,430
Ha ha ha ha.

1194
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:03,650
All right.

1195
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:04,590
That move sucked.

1196
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:07,070
Good for you that I know two moves.

1197
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:07,450
Okay.

1198
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:09,350
And two moves only.

1199
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:11,970
That's right.

1200
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:13,590
Fun shop.

1201
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:14,590
Thank you for the super chat.

1202
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:14,970
Thank you.

1203
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:15,630
Thank you.

1204
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:16,410
Hey, Toki.

1205
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:17,390
It's my birthday last Saturday.

1206
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:18,950
I'm glad you and Dad are doing okay.

1207
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:21,610
Are you sure we can't even have even a little...

1208
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:25,130
little Dad's spinal fluid as a treat?

1209
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:28,850
It's the secret of Longgood's creation.

1210
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:34,150
If you get a piece of the spinal fluid, you grow one inch taller.

1211
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:37,250
Ye olde mede...

1212
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,310
Medieval...

1213
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:39,030
Uh...

1214
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,610
Ye olde medieval medicine.

1215
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:44,570
Just need a little bit.

1216
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:45,790
Just a little drop.

1217
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:49,990
Gotta make soup out of it, too.

1218
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,210
But happy belated birthday.

1219
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,010
I wish I...

1220
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:56,650
I don't remember if I ever...

1221
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:57,250
Samuel...

1222
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:58,250
Wait, what is he doing here?

1223
00:55:59,370 --> 00:55:59,930
Mario!

1224
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:01,130
Wait, that's an admin.

1225
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:02,610
What are these grunts...

1226
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:03,470
Those grunts doing?

1227
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:04,050
Whatever.

1228
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:06,250
I'll stop you myself.

1229
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:09,150
Oh my god, he's a leader.

1230
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:11,330
Happy birthday to you.

1231
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:13,310
Happy birthday to you.

1232
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,610
Happy birthday, dear Fudgetup.

1233
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:17,150
Happy birthday to you.

1234
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:19,110
Oh my god, he's all armored up.

1235
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,400
Trip, thank you for the super chat.

1236
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,420
Thank you, thank you.

1237
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,260
Yeah, I should be able to capture him myself.

1238
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,280
If, like, I accidentally...

1239
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,020
Like, okay, the moment he knocks off...

1240
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,460
The moment his hat is off, he's, like, free reign.

1241
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,320
To be captured.

1242
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,680
What if, like, I just take off his hat...

1243
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,940
And just throw a ball at him?

1244
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,300
You don't know that.

1245
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,240
Nobody will know he was actually a player.

1246
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:49,670
I have a trip, thank you.

1247
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:50,710
What the fuck is that?

1248
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,030
That's a shape.

1249
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:54,430
What are you?

1250
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,290
Is there a square?

1251
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:57,870
Is there a square hole for you?

1252
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:00,150
That's just a shape.

1253
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,910
Oh, no, he made me paralyzed.

1254
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,550
Can't do that.

1255
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:04,850
I paid 10K.

1256
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:09,030
That's fucked up.

1257
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:10,630
I paid 10K.

1258
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:16,750
All right.

1259
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:19,930
Wait.

1260
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:20,530
Stop.

1261
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:21,950
No, I want to learn storms.

1262
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:23,110
Uh, what is this?

1263
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:23,930
Storm throw?

1264
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:27,630
Uh, 60.

1265
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:28,990
Wait, it's weaker.

1266
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:29,410
Okay.

1267
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:30,810
Actually...

1268
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,430
Oh, it always results in a critical hit.

1269
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:35,130
Wait, that's good.

1270
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:36,890
I'll get rid of flame charge then.

1271
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,000
Is that why your neck...

1272
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:43,920
Yes, every time...

1273
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,940
When I see it...

1274
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:48,960
Little dude, I know the reason why he had to get surgery was I drank all his fluids out.

1275
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,880
Like, suck a straw...

1276
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,060
Through his body.

1277
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,980
And then, like, I would...

1278
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,460
And then, like, we had to refill his fluids.

1279
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,900
And that's why he's at the hospital.

1280
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,320
I took away too much of his spinal fluids.

1281
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,960
Uh, Lord Kurosis, thank you for the super chat.

1282
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,060
Thank you, thank you.

1283
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,140
Okay, but what about, like...

1284
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:10,300
I dropped.

1285
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:12,200
Thank you for the super chat.

1286
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,140
Thank you, thank you.

1287
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:14,300
Okay, let's try the storm throw.

1288
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,000
And you call us...

1289
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,780
You guys are the ones that want to fucking buy his business.

1290
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,760
Like, pieces of his disc.

1291
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,820
I'm out of the freak.

1292
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,800
Yeah, I got the admin.

1293
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,220
I just wanted to sell it as a joke.

1294
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,780
I didn't actually want to sell it.

1295
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,740
It was a hee-hee-ha-ha joke.

1296
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:51,970
Alright.

1297
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:52,450
Oh, wait.

1298
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:53,110
There's a cameraman.

1299
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:54,410
What's that?

1300
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:57,330
A toad is stuck on a cloud over in Cloud Cap?

1301
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,190
Oh, of course they are.

1302
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:00,290
Around here.

1303
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,610
Everyone needs to be more careful around here.

1304
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:05,590
Us Locky Toos can't save everyone.

1305
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:10,990
Listen, if you want me to save him, you're gonna need to cough up 500...

1306
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:11,710
Nah, it's fine.

1307
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:13,550
Are you desperate to get him saved?

1308
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:17,870
I'm sure Princess Daisy can lend him a hand after her cap challenge.

1309
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:21,710
Although, I wouldn't be happy waiting that long if I were...

1310
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:23,450
No, I'm not paying $500.

1311
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:24,070
No.

1312
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:27,010
I mean, there's so many toads here.

1313
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:27,710
Like...

1314
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:30,550
Like, we can replace...

1315
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:31,190
How...

1316
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:31,830
How...

1317
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:36,650
We can literally grab a toad and be like, congratulations, you're Captain Toad.

1318
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:38,890
Like, that can't be his fucking name.

1319
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,010
Captain Toad?

1320
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:42,750
He has not trademarked Captain Toad.

1321
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:45,370
I'll just grab a random toad and give him a hat.

1322
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:46,890
Hey, Mario.

1323
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:47,890
It's me.

1324
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:48,450
Photo.

1325
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:50,390
One picture taken for your time.

1326
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:51,030
Yeah, I do.

1327
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,070
Great, why don't you stand over there?

1328
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:53,870
Perfect.

1329
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:57,410
Now, how about a Super Mario Super Jump for the camera?

1330
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:00,150
Your photo's uploading.

1331
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:01,210
Check it later.

1332
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:05,890
Just go to my account, photocap.bluesky.social.

1333
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,750
Daisy's love battling with ground-type capture.

1334
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:17,310
I've seen people bring nearby Typhoon to hit him with super effective moves and Toadie the Dodger attacks.

1335
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:19,130
Thanks for letting me know.

1336
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:20,230
All right.

1337
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:24,010
I'm wearing pants under my grass skirt in case it flies off in the wind.

1338
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:25,330
What kind of pants?

1339
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:26,870
Laminated demnum.

1340
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:28,370
All right.

1341
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:28,790
Nice.

1342
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:32,050
So you'll see my picture in that social media post.

1343
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:34,690
All right.

1344
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:34,910
Yeah.

1345
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:35,930
Please heal them.

1346
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:42,110
Trip, welcome to Tomato Farm.

1347
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:42,710
Welcome.

1348
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:43,150
Welcome.

1349
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,190
Boss, thank you for the super chat.

1350
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:46,570
Thank you.

1351
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:47,370
Thank you.

1352
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,790
You know that bombs learn an explosion at level 34?

1353
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:51,970
Don't believe it?

1354
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:53,210
Look up your...

1355
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:53,570
Don't...

1356
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:54,210
It's like...

1357
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:57,570
Did you know that bomb inflation is real?

1358
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:58,230
Look it up.

1359
01:00:58,450 --> 01:00:58,590
Yeah.

1360
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:02,010
The way it says that.

1361
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:06,400
Okay.

1362
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:08,200
Fudgetop.

1363
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:09,100
Thank you for the super chat.

1364
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:09,440
Thank you.

1365
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:09,960
Thank you.

1366
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:10,320
Fine.

1367
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,960
But the long goose have something already.

1368
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:12,740
Can we suck it?

1369
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,360
Yeah, you can.

1370
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,780
Just stick a straw into their neck and go...

1371
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:19,320
It's like...

1372
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,440
Or you can suck it off through other...

1373
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:29,480
It's like combing separate dad's...

1374
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,600
Spinal fluid.

1375
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:33,160
Please don't.

1376
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:34,240
What?

1377
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:38,300
Long goose, explain.

1378
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:39,600
What happened?

1379
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,300
What happened to my beautiful airship?

1380
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:50,680
First of all, orange, yellow, and green is not intimidating.

1381
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,760
Wait, but he's orange, yellow, and green.

1382
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:59,280
Secondly, how can a propeller moving that slow get any lift?

1383
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:04,580
And worst of all, I don't see my awesome face anywhere.

1384
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,420
Do I have to save Captain Toad?

1385
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:11,920
Can I just defeat Daisy and then she'll save him for me?

1386
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:13,760
Mario!

1387
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:17,340
I'm not surprised my cronies couldn't hold you back.

1388
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,060
You better be prepared.

1389
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:22,720
Because Kamek and I have been talking about strategy.

1390
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,500
This pyre star is mine!

1391
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,100
Breakfast.

1392
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,240
Thank you for the super chat.

1393
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:31,660
Thank you.

1394
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:32,240
Thank you.

1395
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:32,820
Merchant idea.

1396
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:36,020
Dad build a bear-ass plush, but instead of the heart that goes in...

1397
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,760
It's a vial of the fluid.

1398
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:46,060
Guys, I don't know how big you think a fucking vial is.

1399
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,920
It's not that big.

1400
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:53,840
It's like those tiny ass, like, like, like those, like, you know, surgical vials, guys.

1401
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,100
It's not like a fucking jar of spinal fluid.

1402
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,740
Okay, let's see.

1403
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,140
Mecha Koopa.

1404
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:01,980
Let's try Spark.

1405
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:05,160
Oh my god, it's the Mecha Koopas.

1406
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,640
I hated those in the Super Mario.

1407
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:08,700
And that...

1408
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:08,960
Which one?

1409
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:09,720
Which game was it?

1410
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,480
I played it on stream before, too.

1411
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:12,220
Oh my god!

1412
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,700
No, he can't be paralyzed again!

1413
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,600
Please, I don't have 10k!

1414
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:26,260
I do, but I can't afford another 10k.

1415
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,500
Oh, it has lightning rod.

1416
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,480
I'm so dumb.

1417
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:32,900
Yeah, Super Mario move.

1418
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:35,680
Alright.

1419
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:41,580
Alright, there you go.

1420
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:47,940
Nice.

1421
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:49,920
Alright.

1422
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,820
Oh, I can use Spark on this one.

1423
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:53,960
Don't worry, he'll heal himself.

1424
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,340
I believe in him.

1425
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:00,040
Oh my god, I'm confused and paralyzed!

1426
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,100
Oh wait, not me.

1427
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:01,760
Dad is.

1428
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,280
Oh my god.

1429
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,840
Another 10k down the drain.

1430
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,680
At least there's free healthcare in Toad World.

1431
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,340
Oh, he's about to use Bowser.

1432
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,040
Fuck it.

1433
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:15,620
Let's go.

1434
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,320
I'll fight him.

1435
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:19,900
Let's go.

1436
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,360
You know what?

1437
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,440
I'm gonna chuck you.

1438
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:26,440
Alright.

1439
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:27,680
What's he gonna do?

1440
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,200
Kill me?

1441
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:28,620
Yeah, there you go.

1442
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:29,700
I'm not confused anymore.

1443
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,520
Okay, that is pretty strong.

1444
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:34,320
Wait, that's my strong...

1445
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,880
No, Vite of Throw is my strongest move.

1446
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:38,780
Alright, at least I'm not confused.

1447
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,780
That is strong.

1448
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,040
Alright, you know what?

1449
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,100
I'll end it with Flame Wheel.

1450
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,600
One of every move.

1451
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:51,300
He'll live.

1452
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,080
Oh fuck.

1453
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:53,500
Okay.

1454
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:55,260
He'll live.

1455
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,180
He'll live this up.

1456
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:56,420
Next.

1457
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,080
Do you only have one move?

1458
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,060
Is this your struggle?

1459
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:03,180
He literally has one move.

1460
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,400
Nice.

1461
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:09,740
Yeah.

1462
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:12,880
Leveled up.

1463
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,180
Drag one leveled up too.

1464
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,440
Not even close.

1465
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,860
Washer, thank you for the super chat.

1466
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,200
Thank you.

1467
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:23,800
Thank you.

1468
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:29,900
Bottle, tap, water, call it, tax, put, sell it, and donate the proceeds to Adam's.

1469
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,380
I think I'd actually get like called by like an inspector or something.

1470
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:42,980
Like someone's gonna fucking report me and be like, this person's trying to sell their dog's spider flute.

1471
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:46,340
Please like, like the, the, what was it?

1472
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:50,280
The, there's like the pet society or whatever's gonna come up.

1473
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:53,260
Be like, we have reports that you're selling your dog's spider fluids.

1474
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:57,260
I'm going straight to the next one.

1475
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:02,220
Your Highness, I have prepared, please scouted the ship.

1476
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,160
This pirate star will be.

1477
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:06,980
Mario!

1478
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,200
What are you doing here?

1479
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:11,680
I see.

1480
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:15,700
My liege has made an expedited but tactical retreat.

1481
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,140
Wait, wait for me!

1482
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,280
Alright, let's go heal real quick.

1483
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:21,800
Yeah.

1484
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:22,900
Not Pita.

1485
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,180
Pita doesn't do jack shit.

1486
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:28,480
Also like, Pita is not a good org in general.

1487
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:31,320
All they do is just rage bait.

1488
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:33,540
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

1489
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:36,100
Thank you, thank you, chatreflexstreamer.

1490
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,720
Thank you for the super chat, Anton.

1491
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:38,360
Thank you, thank you.

1492
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:40,300
There's like a Canadian pet society.

1493
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:41,320
Can pet humane society?

1494
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,100
I'll press it.

1495
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:44,240
I like pressing buttons.

1496
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,260
Woo-hoo!

1497
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:49,040
Oh yeah, let me hear it.

1498
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,380
Daisy!

1499
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,260
Daisy!

1500
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,220
Daisy!

1501
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:52,940
Daisy!

1502
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,740
Mario!

1503
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,980
It's about time you showed up.

1504
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:01,040
Welcome aboard the Cloud Cutter.

1505
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,840
My air shape and striker stadium.

1506
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:09,180
We're gonna have lots of fun fighting for your power star.

1507
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,740
She'll look better if she was an elephant.

1508
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:13,400
Not gonna...

1509
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,340
Guys, I've heard about the elephant, man.

1510
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:17,960
Now then.

1511
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,960
For those who don't know, there's this guy who goes...

1512
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:27,700
Anytime someone posts art of Daisy, this guy goes over and commissions them to draw an elephant version of them.

1513
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:31,740
And like, I can't tell if it's a fetish or if it's like...

1514
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:36,380
If it's like some meme thing that he's doing for content.

1515
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Are we ready for a game?

1516
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:44,970
Wait, what?

1517
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:46,630
Listen up, Mario.

1518
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:50,350
Do whatever it takes to get a bullet built into the goal.

1519
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:54,090
And you better not come complaining to me if you can't figure it out.

1520
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:56,690
Okay.

1521
01:07:58,290 --> 01:07:58,810
Okay.

1522
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:00,050
Okay, so obviously I have to do that.

1523
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:02,190
Okay.

1524
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:04,330
Alright.

1525
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:10,340
Whoops.

1526
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:12,320
Um.

1527
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,080
Wait, I can't hit anything now.

1528
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:18,420
Struggling, are we?

1529
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,380
No, I just can't hit anything.

1530
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,640
Alright, don't worry.

1531
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,420
Wait, this is a ground type.

1532
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,200
I'll just throw it.

1533
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:30,400
Wait, he used protect...

1534
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,020
PUSSY!

1535
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:35,920
Oh, and I heard him.

1536
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:36,540
Oh my god.

1537
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,480
It's because I touched him.

1538
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:41,060
Don't worry.

1539
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,720
I'll still chuck you.

1540
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:45,960
That's right.

1541
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:47,000
I don't care.

1542
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:50,380
PUSS, thank you for the super chat.

1543
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:50,760
Thank you.

1544
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:51,340
Thank you.

1545
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:52,860
Time to fund for...

1546
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:55,860
We need to multiply the long goons.

1547
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,580
Thank you for the super chat.

1548
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:58,040
Thank you.

1549
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:58,560
Thank you.

1550
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:01,180
Doki, have you ever tried throwing a cactus?

1551
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:03,960
What?

1552
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,900
He has gloves on.

1553
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,340
I saw him have a glove on.

1554
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:11,480
It's not like he can't fucking...

1555
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,600
Like...

1556
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,680
It's not gonna hurt his hands if he's gloved up.

1557
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:17,140
All right.

1558
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,080
We don't need for a re-attack.

1559
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:23,990
He got one mon?

1560
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:26,210
What are you doing, you failure?

1561
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:29,670
Yeah, I know.

1562
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:30,350
You can do it, Ma.

1563
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:30,870
Pay attention.

1564
01:09:30,990 --> 01:09:31,870
Yeah, but I can't...

1565
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:32,290
Oh, wait.

1566
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:33,030
I still can.

1567
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:33,470
Okay.

1568
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:35,690
I was gonna say, why can't I hit these anymore?

1569
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:37,370
Okay.

1570
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:39,370
Obviously...

1571
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:42,710
We need to figure out how to get rid of this one.

1572
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:44,850
Okay.

1573
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:45,670
That's how.

1574
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:47,590
And then...

1575
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:49,570
There we go.

1576
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:50,730
And I do this.

1577
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:52,490
There we go.

1578
01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:53,530
I figured out the puzzle.

1579
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:54,250
It's not that hard.

1580
01:09:57,870 --> 01:09:58,390
Yeah!

1581
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,380
I expected no less from you, Mario.

1582
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,560
Let's hurry up and battle.

1583
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:12,680
Daisy!

1584
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:13,560
Daisy!

1585
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:14,420
Daisy!

1586
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:17,700
So easy.

1587
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,560
I should have healed Dad.

1588
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,220
All right.

1589
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,780
It's time to throw a cactus.

1590
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:24,520
Wait.

1591
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:25,420
I could burn the cactus.

1592
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:26,320
What am I fucking doing?

1593
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:26,800
It's grass.

1594
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,660
What am I going to do?

1595
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:31,260
What the fuck am I doing?

1596
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,700
It's a goddamn cactus.

1597
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:35,820
How am I hurt?

1598
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,520
Oh, it charged in flame.

1599
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:37,920
Okay.

1600
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,560
It's fine.

1601
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:44,640
All right.

1602
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:45,460
Tweester?

1603
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,360
Who's tweester?

1604
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,440
Oh, it's a twister.

1605
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:51,200
Oh!

1606
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,020
I mean...

1607
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:54,460
I'm gonna...

1608
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:54,900
You know what?

1609
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:56,720
I'm gonna throw a twister.

1610
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:00,800
I'm a hurricane chaser.

1611
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,580
Oh, my God.

1612
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:03,320
Oh, I'm...

1613
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:05,660
Doesn't matter.

1614
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,880
I chase hurricanes.

1615
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,720
Go to the eye of the storm.

1616
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:10,860
I should...

1617
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:10,980
Okay.

1618
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,600
He's gonna live.

1619
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:11,980
Okay.

1620
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:13,940
Oh, and I'm trapped by the sand tomb.

1621
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:14,600
Oh.

1622
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:16,800
Okay.

1623
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:19,100
That's okay.

1624
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:19,820
That's okay.

1625
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:22,120
I believe in you, tragoon.

1626
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,120
That's okay.

1627
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,360
It's time...

1628
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,660
It's time to lick the twister.

1629
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,900
Oh, wait.

1630
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,140
It's not that effective.

1631
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:38,880
It's okay.

1632
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:42,140
Stop looking at us.

1633
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,420
Why don't...

1634
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:44,500
Keep licking!

1635
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:47,200
Lick the twister.

1636
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,080
Nice.

1637
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,680
Toki, please switch the tragoon out.

1638
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:06,240
All right.

1639
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:07,440
Monty Mole.

1640
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:07,840
Okay.

1641
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:08,280
Yeah.

1642
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:09,560
Wait, I can use water.

1643
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,620
Who has a...

1644
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:11,760
Okay.

1645
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:12,500
Progoon.

1646
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,100
It's time.

1647
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,120
Use your fishy powers.

1648
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:22,010
All right.

1649
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:22,990
Bubble beam.

1650
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:25,170
Oh my God.

1651
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,330
It's your time.

1652
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:29,470
Oh my God.

1653
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:32,710
Who would have thought water is strong against ground type?

1654
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:36,230
Who would have thought type advantages?

1655
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:39,410
You're gonna dig a fucking hole, you coward?

1656
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:42,150
Get out of here!

1657
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:45,430
Fight me like a mod!

1658
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:47,430
What does it really matter?

1659
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:48,630
He's gonna fucking dig.

1660
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,250
Like...

1661
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:49,930
Like...

1662
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:51,290
I have to wait until he comes back.

1663
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:57,320
All right.

1664
01:12:57,860 --> 01:12:58,840
It's time to take a bath.

1665
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,440
Yeah!

1666
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:08,260
Easy.

1667
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,720
Level up.

1668
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:12,880
Oh my God.

1669
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,500
I won without using dad.

1670
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:15,580
What is that?

1671
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,400
No!

1672
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,920
I wanted to win!

1673
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:22,080
It's too late, Daisy.

1674
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,260
You're not the main character.

1675
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,220
Game, set, and match!

1676
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,160
And our winner is...

1677
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:28,700
Mario!

1678
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:30,160
Mario!

1679
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:31,820
Mario!

1680
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:33,540
Mario!

1681
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:35,620
And I believe this trophy goes to you.

1682
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,440
Mario received the Cloud Kingdom Power Star!

1683
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:40,740
Yippee!

1684
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,020
Let's try to try it harder, Daisy.

1685
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,840
Your second Power Star from yours truly.

1686
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:51,940
I know.

1687
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,300
Bask in its glory.

1688
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,200
But not for too long.

1689
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,500
Because I have something else to award you.

1690
01:13:58,260 --> 01:13:58,600
Yay!

1691
01:13:58,960 --> 01:13:59,880
I got TM16!

1692
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,140
I'll never use.

1693
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,720
Because I never use TM moves.

1694
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:04,920
Thanks for pulling along, Mario.

1695
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:07,620
Tell your brother I'll be waiting for him.

1696
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:08,980
What's that?

1697
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:12,340
You need me to go pick up a stuck toad and cloud cap?

1698
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:13,460
Sure thing!

1699
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:14,640
Yay!

1700
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:15,500
I did it!

1701
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:16,960
I picked him up.

1702
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:18,800
That's it?

1703
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,500
You better not press this again.

1704
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:22,860
Oh my God.

1705
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,840
See, I didn't have to pay him.

1706
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:25,440
Look at that.

1707
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:27,100
I didn't have to pay him.

1708
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:29,680
Man, Princess Daisy is so cool.

1709
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,360
Her part in the cap channel isn't sure to be extreme.

1710
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,640
But that didn't even have to pay.

1711
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,280
Extreme, thank you for the super chat.

1712
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:39,180
Thank you, thank you.

1713
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:45,860
After the Mario Wonder Direct, I measured how much time it took for the first spicy elephant Daisy art to hit the internet.

1714
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:48,180
It took nine minutes.

1715
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,780
Thank you for the super chat.

1716
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:54,120
Thank you, thank you.

1717
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:55,600
What do you mean?

1718
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:59,460
What was the first spicy elephant heart of Daisy?

1719
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:00,320
Daisy.

1720
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,000
You're right.

1721
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:04,780
Kind of slow.

1722
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:05,300
You're right.

1723
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:07,100
It should have been one minute.

1724
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:08,720
Alright.

1725
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:11,980
Wait, is that...

1726
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:12,860
Oh my gosh.

1727
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:14,380
I have to turn this.

1728
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,820
It has to be a faster way...

1729
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:18,540
To get down, right?

1730
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:20,680
I do have to get Toadie, though.

1731
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:21,860
I need to catch a Toadie.

1732
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:24,380
There's a Toadie.

1733
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:25,460
Stop giving me Toadie.

1734
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,360
Stop giving me Toadie.

1735
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:33,880
Stop giving me Toadie.

1736
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:35,740
I need Toadie.

1737
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,360
Oh, there's Toadie.

1738
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:36,760
Alright.

1739
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:38,940
I'm gonna catch a Toadie.

1740
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,660
Get you in, Drago.

1741
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:42,940
It's time to do more licking.

1742
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:46,640
That's the only move you'll use throughout this run.

1743
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:51,220
I love it.

1744
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,760
I love whenever she looks at me like that.

1745
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:55,620
It makes me so happy.

1746
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,520
It's time to lick the Toad.

1747
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:02,420
I'm so tired.

1748
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,140
Lick the Toad, Drago.

1749
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,000
Lick him.

1750
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:10,220
Alright.

1751
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,040
Time to catch.

1752
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:15,170
Yeah.

1753
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,310
Alright.

1754
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:19,310
Who wants to be Toadie?

1755
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,050
Toadie was caught.

1756
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:24,170
Yeah.

1757
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:34,150
A Koopa that learned flight through magical means.

1758
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:40,490
It spends most of its time studying and become a full magic Koopa and kidnapping baby.

1759
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:41,130
Wait.

1760
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:42,170
Where did I...

1761
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:42,490
What?

1762
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:45,610
He kidnaps babies?

1763
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:47,370
Oh my god.

1764
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:48,070
Alright.

1765
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,870
Who wants to be a baby kidnapper?

1766
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:50,810
Who...

1767
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:56,450
Who wants to be a baby kidnapper, guys?

1768
01:16:56,990 --> 01:16:58,570
From Yoshi's Island?

1769
01:16:58,830 --> 01:16:59,830
Oh, I never played Yoshi's...

1770
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:04,470
You guys can tell I sort of, like, have very limited, uh, Mario experience.

1771
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:07,270
Who has not...

1772
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:08,810
Who has not been...

1773
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:10,110
Who has not been named yet?

1774
01:17:11,010 --> 01:17:11,530
Alright.

1775
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:14,050
Who said no?

1776
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:19,130
Smug.

1777
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:20,690
Smug.

1778
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:20,950
Smug.

1779
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:21,470
Smug.

1780
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:21,890
Goon.

1781
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:23,970
You're gonna be a baby kidnapper.

1782
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:28,150
Smug.

1783
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:30,570
Goon.

1784
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:32,710
Just for that.

1785
01:17:33,330 --> 01:17:35,290
You're hiding something, I can tell.

1786
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:36,150
I...

1787
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:41,530
You're hiding a deep, dark secret.

1788
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:47,210
I know what you are.

1789
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:49,890
Officer, it's that guy.

1790
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:51,950
I know what you are.

1791
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:00,650
You're a baby kidnapper.

1792
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:02,590
Alright.

1793
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:06,030
I don't want to go through the grass here since we just defeated him.

1794
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:07,610
Ohhhh.

1795
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:09,950
I need to...

1796
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:12,130
I need to go home.

1797
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:13,210
Which one was home?

1798
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:15,290
No, it's not this one.

1799
01:18:17,410 --> 01:18:18,090
Oh my god.

1800
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:18,690
Oh my god.

1801
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:20,270
I don't know how the hole...

1802
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:23,390
I think I missed the hole like five times.

1803
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:24,730
This is...

1804
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:26,770
Okay.

1805
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:27,050
Whoops.

1806
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:28,550
Alright.

1807
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:29,710
I want...

1808
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:30,590
Actually...

1809
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:31,290
Let me...

1810
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:33,830
Let me check my thing.

1811
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:34,230
Okay.

1812
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:35,430
So I have...

1813
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:37,730
What are my types for these guys?

1814
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:42,590
I have dark, steel, water, normal, grass.

1815
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:45,030
Okay.

1816
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:46,030
I rather keep...

1817
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:46,170
Okay.

1818
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:47,510
Dark or steel?

1819
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:49,490
Uh...

1820
01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:51,530
Uh...

1821
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:53,190
Mmm...

1822
01:18:53,190 --> 01:18:54,170
Sorry, Nexy.

1823
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:56,250
I'm swapping you out for flying.

1824
01:18:59,410 --> 01:19:00,710
I'm swapping you out.

1825
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:01,930
I forgot I made this.

1826
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:06,990
I'm swapping you...

1827
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:09,890
How does it feel to be swapped for a baby napper?

1828
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:12,910
Ah...

1829
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:13,510
Ok.

1830
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:20,710
Let's see.

1831
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:21,390
We'll go back.

1832
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:25,570
Mario!

1833
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:26,530
There you are!

1834
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:27,490
Who said that?

1835
01:19:27,610 --> 01:19:28,310
Oh, it's Professor.

1836
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:29,790
Oh...

1837
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:31,070
Caught up to you again!

1838
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:34,350
You're really making quick work of these worlds.

1839
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:35,090
Hey, boy.

1840
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:39,490
At least I know I can always catch you at the warp zone next to you.

1841
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:40,370
Thank you for the super chat.

1842
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:41,270
Thank you.

1843
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:42,870
I had a good run.

1844
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:45,690
Hey, boy.

1845
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:50,170
Speaking of, the topic of warp zone is precisely why I'm here.

1846
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:52,530
I want you to have this, Mario.

1847
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:54,770
Well, I got the warp pipe.

1848
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:55,590
What does it do?

1849
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:57,850
That's right.

1850
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:00,750
There is a portable warp pipe.

1851
01:20:00,990 --> 01:20:04,090
It'll take you to a warp zone of any place that has one.

1852
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:08,210
Knowing that, I can even take you to places without a warp zone.

1853
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:10,850
Aren't my inventions just wonderful?

1854
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:13,770
Anyways, do you know where you're going next?

1855
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:17,090
I hear that words from both World 3 and 4 are up and running.

1856
01:20:17,690 --> 01:20:19,090
Choose whichever you like.

1857
01:20:20,390 --> 01:20:22,570
Oh, so I can just travel anywhere now.

1858
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:25,110
Yeah, take me to World 3.

1859
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:28,930
Cafe, thank you for the super chat.

1860
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:29,910
Thank you, thank you.

1861
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:30,710
Hey, Doki.

1862
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:34,050
Excited to see you when I go to Phantom Man and Off Kai this year.

1863
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:37,210
I plan to attempt a makeshift cosplay, so I hope I can get it by then.

1864
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:40,270
Also, why would I be potentially thrown into the isekai?

1865
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:41,230
Maybe.

1866
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:42,530
Thank you for the super chat.

1867
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:43,530
Thank you, thank you.

1868
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:45,430
Meanwhile...

1869
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:47,210
Oh, where's Bowser going?

1870
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:51,050
So Mario thinks he can beat us by going to World 3 first?

1871
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:51,570
Ha!

1872
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:54,190
He doesn't know that World 4 is quicker to go through.

1873
01:20:54,190 --> 01:20:57,930
He's gonna be mighty surprised when he returns, Kamek!

1874
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:00,690
Yes, your ugliness?

1875
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:03,030
Destroy this warp pipe.

1876
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:05,490
With gusto, my liege.

1877
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:07,190
Wait, I can just use my...

1878
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:09,230
What do you do?

1879
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:10,150
Bwahaha!

1880
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:12,610
Kamek!

1881
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:14,230
Oh, where's to World 4?

1882
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:16,350
Kamek!

1883
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:17,370
Wait, but he just destroyed it.

1884
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:18,950
Kamek?

1885
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:21,270
Yes, my horridness.

1886
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:24,570
Parody airship for World 4.

1887
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:25,630
Yeah, he just plugged it up.

1888
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:27,390
Where's like my...

1889
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:29,430
Isn't this place guarded by toads?

1890
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:32,290
What did the princess pay you for?

1891
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:35,670
Okay, so...

1892
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:38,690
Like, what's the point of having a princess if like...

1893
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:41,630
Having a job here if you don't do your job?

1894
01:21:44,630 --> 01:21:45,530
War pipe.

1895
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:48,610
List, okay.

1896
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:51,250
Oh, I have to be there already.

1897
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:52,730
Okay, so that's my fly move.

1898
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:54,650
Oh, I see.

1899
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:58,270
So, instead of having regular fly, I just have that.

1900
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:01,790
Okay, I just thought I could go through here for something.

1901
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:02,950
What was that?

1902
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:05,970
9,999.

1903
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:07,890
10,000.

1904
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:09,570
All powered up.

1905
01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:10,890
Peridotty?

1906
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:12,130
What are you?

1907
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:15,250
What the fuck is that?

1908
01:22:17,330 --> 01:22:17,890
Cat.

1909
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:18,890
Cat quack.

1910
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:19,870
Cat-a-quack.

1911
01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:20,690
Oh, that's cute.

1912
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,270
Let's throw it.

1913
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:25,850
Yeah, me too.

1914
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:26,750
What is that?

1915
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:27,950
Like, who is that?

1916
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:29,310
What game is he from?

1917
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:33,490
Mario Sunshine?

1918
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:36,210
Maybe I should try Mario Sunshine one day.

1919
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:41,390
Never played Mario Sunshine before.

1920
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:46,130
Well, he's dead now.

1921
01:22:49,190 --> 01:22:49,710
Mario...

1922
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:50,110
Mario...

1923
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:53,170
Bowser literally did something Jokey would accidentally do.

1924
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:54,970
Thank you for the Super Chat Darkblade.

1925
01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:56,010
Thank you, thank you.

1926
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:58,130
A game I really want to play is...

1927
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:00,890
Um, I want to play Epic Mickey.

1928
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:02,810
After I finish one game.

1929
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:06,410
Like, after I finish Dynasty Warriors, I want to play Epic Mickey.

1930
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:08,410
Or this one.

1931
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:09,150
Whichever first.

1932
01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:17,790
I can't hit that?

1933
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:18,890
What's the point?

1934
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:20,210
It's just a block.

1935
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:22,850
Oh my god, he's angry.

1936
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,870
Wait, isn't that from...

1937
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:26,090
What the fuck?

1938
01:23:26,090 --> 01:23:28,250
I'm gonna catch the sun.

1939
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:33,210
Alright, you know what to do.

1940
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:34,210
Try good.

1941
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:35,150
It's time.

1942
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:37,970
It's time to lick the sun.

1943
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:46,030
I'm gonna make you lick the sun.

1944
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:48,310
No.

1945
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:48,390
No.

1946
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:54,610
Praise the sun.

1947
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:56,190
Lick the sun.

1948
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:57,870
Oh my god.

1949
01:23:58,190 --> 01:23:59,570
Wait, it does no damage.

1950
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:01,610
Okay.

1951
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:03,590
Okay, I'll stop licking the...

1952
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:05,570
Why not swallow the sun?

1953
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:08,410
Now it's time to bite the sun.

1954
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:13,750
That's right.

1955
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:14,250
Ooh.

1956
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:16,890
That's right.

1957
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:20,410
Lick that sun.

1958
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:28,950
Keep biting harder.

1959
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:30,230
Oh shit.

1960
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:32,170
Oh, you're not dead.

1961
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:32,910
Okay, that's good.

1962
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:35,290
Alright, now I can catch you.

1963
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:41,370
Swallow the sun.

1964
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:42,910
Alright, cafe.

1965
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:45,330
I'll name you after the angry sun.

1966
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:51,270
Nice.

1967
01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:52,310
Number 18.

1968
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:57,560
Wow.

1969
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,180
Why is he angry?

1970
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,220
He's just angry, guys.

1971
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:06,380
Bro, he's only...

1972
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:07,080
Bro, he's 400.

1973
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:08,120
Oh my god.

1974
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:11,020
He's only 339 pounds.

1975
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:13,580
Bro, he's a fucking giant star.

1976
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:16,440
He's only 339 pounds.

1977
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,480
He's only six foot tall?

1978
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:19,940
That's a tiny...

1979
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,120
Son.

1980
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,700
Tiny, short sun.

1981
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:25,940
Short king.

1982
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:28,440
Alright.

1983
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:31,920
Let's see.

1984
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:36,040
Cafe...

1985
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:38,540
Oh shit.

1986
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,120
Cafe...

1987
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:43,520
Goon.

1988
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:44,900
Ew.

1989
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:47,220
Stop shaming the sun.

1990
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:48,760
That's why he's angry.

1991
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:56,130
Oh wait, it's cat-a-quack!

1992
01:25:57,570 --> 01:25:58,770
Time to lick him.

1993
01:25:59,330 --> 01:25:59,890
Okay.

1994
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:01,630
You should...

1995
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:02,810
I think Dragoon should stop.

1996
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:03,350
Wait, actually no.

1997
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:05,390
It's time to lick the sun.

1998
01:26:06,190 --> 01:26:06,750
Again!

1999
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:11,210
Oh shit.

2000
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:12,470
Okay, maybe not.

2001
01:26:12,970 --> 01:26:13,590
Maybe not.

2002
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:14,410
You're about to die.

2003
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:17,850
Who's the weakest?

2004
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:19,950
Okay, I'll put Hefligoon.

2005
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:22,270
Now we are sun-shaming?

2006
01:26:22,530 --> 01:26:22,810
Dang.

2007
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:25,310
Thank you for the super chat.

2008
01:26:25,470 --> 01:26:26,330
Thank you, thank you.

2009
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:28,050
Oh, it's not very effective.

2010
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:28,430
Okay.

2011
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:29,370
We'll just use tackle.

2012
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:33,890
Um...

2013
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:34,230
Memonto.

2014
01:26:35,230 --> 01:26:36,530
Thank you for the super chat.

2015
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:37,170
Thank you, thank you.

2016
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:39,870
If you like rage-quitting games in Mario Sunshine, maybe for you.

2017
01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:42,550
It's actually pretty tough for a Mario game.

2018
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:43,570
Thank you for the super chat.

2019
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:44,690
Thank you, thank you.

2020
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:46,070
It's a kid's game.

2021
01:26:46,190 --> 01:26:47,470
How bad can it be?

2022
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:53,630
I say as I rage-quitted multiple children games.

2023
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:55,110
Bro, what the fuck?

2024
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:56,490
You're so weak, Hefli.

2025
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:59,270
Guess who's gonna get replaced soon?

2026
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:10,670
Now that I realize how weak you are...

2027
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:14,210
Alright, let's see.

2028
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:17,830
You pointed against the fighting.

2029
01:27:17,970 --> 01:27:20,130
How was I supposed to know he could fight?

2030
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:21,270
It's a...

2031
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:22,210
Look at him!

2032
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:27,500
Alright.

2033
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:32,020
All right, let's just try catching him.

2034
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:35,760
What the fuck?

2035
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,580
Bro, why is he so strong?

2036
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:42,960
Okay, I'll bite you.

2037
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:48,050
I have to like...

2038
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:49,350
Jesus Christ!

2039
01:27:50,230 --> 01:27:51,630
All right, maybe he'll be...

2040
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:54,570
It's only limbs or legs, which means they're...

2041
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:56,850
Yeah, but he has... Look at his mouth!

2042
01:27:57,130 --> 01:27:58,190
Why can't he lick?

2043
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:59,370
Oh, goodbye.

2044
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:01,870
Everything for Cataquack.

2045
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:02,330
Okay.

2046
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:04,290
All right, Husky.

2047
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:06,010
He can't punch...

2048
01:28:06,010 --> 01:28:07,210
What's he gonna punch a plant?

2049
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:10,210
Stun him.

2050
01:28:13,950 --> 01:28:15,650
Okay, how do I miss that?

2051
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:18,370
Yes.

2052
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:20,990
He's gonna punch a plant.

2053
01:28:21,770 --> 01:28:22,730
Okay, now he's done.

2054
01:28:23,610 --> 01:28:25,410
Jesus, this is like the hardest one...

2055
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:27,830
I've had to like capture lately.

2056
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:29,430
Bump.

2057
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:30,370
Bump.

2058
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:30,650
Bump.

2059
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:31,970
All right, who wants to be Cataquack?

2060
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:37,910
He killed Prog Wound.

2061
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,400
All right, a large round creature with beak.

2062
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:50,780
It enjoys fighting, flinging things or people into the air.

2063
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:52,500
Most always water fighting.

2064
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:56,280
Most are timid and will not approach strangers unprovoked.

2065
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:57,700
All right.

2066
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:58,360
All right.

2067
01:28:58,820 --> 01:28:59,720
Let's see.

2068
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:00,580
Cataquack.

2069
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:03,780
Someone who is not me.

2070
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:04,480
I...

2071
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:08,600
All right.

2072
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:09,920
Water.

2073
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,080
Water fighting.

2074
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:16,020
I think it's only natural.

2075
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:16,480
Oh, wait.

2076
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:17,020
You're right.

2077
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:17,400
Duck.

2078
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:17,960
Thank you.

2079
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,200
Super chat.

2080
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:19,800
Thank you.

2081
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:20,700
Thank you.

2082
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:21,740
You're right.

2083
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,400
You're actually right.

2084
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,280
You should be the duck one.

2085
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:27,660
Duck.

2086
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:29,120
Uh...

2087
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:29,440
Duck.

2088
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,280
Goon.

2089
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:32,960
All right.

2090
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:34,260
Perfect.

2091
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:37,340
Into the Pokemon.

2092
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:38,380
Wait.

2093
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:39,920
Actually, I need to...

2094
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:40,340
Wait.

2095
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:41,280
I need to know how to...

2096
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,680
Learn how to use this more effectively.

2097
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:43,500
There you go.

2098
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:45,660
I gotta warp back.

2099
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:47,540
Castle Gardens.

2100
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:48,700
Peaches Castle.

2101
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:51,580
Uh...

2102
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:52,160
Toe Town.

2103
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:52,540
Yeah.

2104
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:53,500
Let's go to Toe Town.

2105
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:54,120
I gotta heal.

2106
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,040
A lot of you guys are fucked up right now.

2107
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:00,760
Yay!

2108
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:06,370
The map looks really cool.

2109
01:30:07,450 --> 01:30:07,890
Wait.

2110
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:09,450
Can I, like, warp back to there?

2111
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:11,410
I wonder.

2112
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:14,070
Oh, I can.

2113
01:30:14,290 --> 01:30:14,930
Yeah, because I start...

2114
01:30:14,930 --> 01:30:15,770
No, I can't?

2115
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:16,130
Oh.

2116
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:17,790
I thought I could.

2117
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:19,310
How many worlds do we...

2118
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:21,630
Okay, we have one, two, three...

2119
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:25,690
I assume...

2120
01:30:26,930 --> 01:30:27,450
Four...

2121
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:29,170
Five...

2122
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:30,490
Six...

2123
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:31,570
Seven...

2124
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:32,370
Eight...

2125
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:33,670
Oh, there's Rainbow Road!

2126
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:35,290
I assume this is, like...

2127
01:30:35,290 --> 01:30:36,690
After credits, right?

2128
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:39,710
Yeah, Rainbow Road.

2129
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:41,630
It has to be, like...

2130
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:43,430
Uh, Game Plus.

2131
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:48,170
Alright.

2132
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:49,150
Down I go.

2133
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:51,770
Back here.

2134
01:30:54,270 --> 01:30:54,830
Oh!

2135
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:56,750
What am I gonna counter?

2136
01:30:57,210 --> 01:30:58,630
Oh my god, it's Cataquac.

2137
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:00,650
I'm gonna...

2138
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:01,370
Actually, no.

2139
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:03,150
Cataquac is very annoying to fight.

2140
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:04,890
I don't wanna deal with Cataquac.

2141
01:31:05,650 --> 01:31:06,870
I'll fight you.

2142
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:08,910
All the bugs love me!

2143
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:12,590
Okay, Johnny Bravo.

2144
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:15,350
Would like to fight?

2145
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:16,330
Oh my god.

2146
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:18,390
Aw, look!

2147
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:19,290
They're your children!

2148
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:20,670
I'm gonna burn them.

2149
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:23,470
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2150
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:24,750
Yeah?

2151
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:27,490
All your children loves you.

2152
01:31:27,570 --> 01:31:29,130
It would be a shame if I...

2153
01:31:29,130 --> 01:31:30,890
Fucking burn them all.

2154
01:31:33,850 --> 01:31:34,550
Goodbye.

2155
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:38,730
Oh!

2156
01:31:39,070 --> 01:31:41,010
Don't worry, he just fainted.

2157
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:44,390
I tell them, as his...

2158
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:46,450
His children are burnt to crisp.

2159
01:31:47,450 --> 01:31:49,350
Not a sociopath or anything.

2160
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:52,030
Oh god, I hate that.

2161
01:31:52,210 --> 01:31:53,090
I hate that one.

2162
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:53,770
That's so...

2163
01:31:53,770 --> 01:31:54,430
I don't know.

2164
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:55,470
It just makes me uncomfortable.

2165
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:56,590
Like, she's just...

2166
01:31:56,590 --> 01:31:57,070
Like...

2167
01:31:57,070 --> 01:31:58,370
Like, it's coming out...

2168
01:31:58,370 --> 01:32:01,010
She's just standing there looking at me like that.

2169
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:02,090
It's just so uncomfortable.

2170
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:04,470
Yeah, fainted with third degree burn.

2171
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:06,070
That's true.

2172
01:32:07,450 --> 01:32:09,290
Oh my god, it's a granite!

2173
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:12,630
It's the little guys in Super Mario World!

2174
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,340
Sorry, I had to hydrate.

2175
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:24,480
Alright.

2176
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,400
Smogoon!

2177
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:26,860
My boy!

2178
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:28,200
He grew at level 13!

2179
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:31,980
Alright, that one was easy.

2180
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:34,340
Okay, I'm gonna check if there's any more...

2181
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:35,640
That I can catch.

2182
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:37,780
Is there any more?

2183
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:40,220
No, it's all cat-a-quack.

2184
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,400
God, no one loves you!

2185
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:44,060
Get out!

2186
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:46,520
Alright, I'll do one more.

2187
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:47,440
Let's see if there's any.

2188
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:51,560
What the fu- What the fu- Oh!

2189
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:53,620
He looks like the...

2190
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,240
He looks like the Pikmin dogs!

2191
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:56,880
Oh, he's cute!

2192
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:58,020
I think he's cute.

2193
01:32:58,840 --> 01:32:59,160
Alright.

2194
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:02,440
Can't be that bad.

2195
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:04,200
Oh, I'm a water type now.

2196
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:05,760
That's a natural.

2197
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:06,600
I don't like it.

2198
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:07,760
Okay, well...

2199
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,180
Oh, soup- Oops, I forgot he's water type!

2200
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:11,580
Well, goodbye.

2201
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,560
What the fu- What did he do to me?

2202
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:17,540
Okay.

2203
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:18,560
Um, well...

2204
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,720
Let's see if we can catch him again.

2205
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:22,540
Okay, now it's just all cat-a-quack.

2206
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:23,960
Oh, it fucking died.

2207
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:24,320
Oops.

2208
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:27,380
Oopsie.

2209
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:29,040
Guess I just killed it.

2210
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:30,720
And he like...

2211
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:34,940
What the fu- Wait, I recognize him!

2212
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:38,780
Alright, let's put Dragoon out there.

2213
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:39,500
Okay, wait, okay.

2214
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:41,660
Let me not put Dragoon out there.

2215
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:42,940
I'll put Progoon.

2216
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:45,360
That guy's like...

2217
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:46,160
It's like Diglett!

2218
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:46,920
But bigger!

2219
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:52,420
And he's like a bigger Diglett.

2220
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:56,100
Well, obviously, he's gonna be high.

2221
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:56,600
I'll just...

2222
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:57,060
I'll just...

2223
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:00,580
I don't know how strong he is.

2224
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,240
Bubblica...

2225
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:02,780
Bubbl...

2226
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:03,500
Bubbles?

2227
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:04,920
Bubbles!

2228
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,280
Sir, welcome to the...

2229
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:09,000
To the hand farm!

2230
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:09,880
Welcome, welcome!

2231
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:12,660
It's a chunky Diglett.

2232
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:15,620
Let me bite...

2233
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:16,240
Let me bite...

2234
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:16,820
Oh, I missed.

2235
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:21,860
Alright.

2236
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:22,780
Bite him!

2237
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,080
Bite the Diglett!

2238
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,540
Not so Deadpool!

2239
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:29,000
Thank you for the fire!

2240
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:29,820
Give the ships!

2241
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:30,500
Thank you the...

2242
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:32,660
How do I miss every bite?

2243
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,400
I don't understand!

2244
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:38,840
Oh my god, I didn't kill him.

2245
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:39,280
Thank God!

2246
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:40,540
I'm sorry!

2247
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:46,660
Okay, my...

2248
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:48,260
My fish might be a little blind.

2249
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:50,520
Because he's not in water and slowly dying.

2250
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:51,320
What about the air?

2251
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:54,200
Yay!

2252
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,000
Alright, who wants to be...

2253
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:57,220
What's his name?

2254
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:57,900
Minion!

2255
01:34:59,380 --> 01:35:01,360
A servant of a snake king.

2256
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:03,840
The length of its body is unknown.

2257
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:06,220
It is said to train its balance for decades.

2258
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:09,500
In order to balance plates and bowls in its head.

2259
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:10,620
Okay.

2260
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,200
So he's useless.

2261
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:14,760
If that's all he does...

2262
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:15,780
Oh my god, look at him.

2263
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:16,280
Haha!

2264
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:17,640
Look at his face!

2265
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:18,920
Alright.

2266
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:20,720
Alright, you know what?

2267
01:35:20,740 --> 01:35:22,020
I'll use the first person.

2268
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:23,200
Uh...

2269
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:23,640
Red.

2270
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:24,740
Red.

2271
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:25,100
Red.

2272
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:26,040
Goon.

2273
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:28,180
That's the first person I saw in my chat.

2274
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:30,260
Red.

2275
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:33,400
Goon.

2276
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:34,000
There we go.

2277
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,200
Oh, it is a long...

2278
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,720
It's a super long goon.

2279
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:39,760
Alright, let's see.

2280
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:40,800
Where are my...

2281
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,880
Are my mons okay?

2282
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:45,640
Oh, yeah.

2283
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:46,280
They're fine.

2284
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:47,380
They're so fine.

2285
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:47,760
Okay.

2286
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:48,560
There's one more.

2287
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:50,240
I'll catch one more.

2288
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:51,580
No!

2289
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:52,620
Get out of cat!

2290
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,320
Nobody loves you!

2291
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:56,760
Get out of my lobby!

2292
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:58,080
Alright.

2293
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:01,000
The ancient lunk.

2294
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:01,960
Oh my god!

2295
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:02,360
Leave!

2296
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:06,860
I will make sure your con is extinct if I get you again.

2297
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:11,890
You're here.

2298
01:36:12,110 --> 01:36:13,390
The angry son.

2299
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:15,870
Oh my god, he's so angry.

2300
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:20,710
Bunch of quacks.

2301
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:21,770
I know.

2302
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:23,390
I'll make fog raw out of you.

2303
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:25,230
That's right.

2304
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:27,770
Oh, that's it.

2305
01:36:28,030 --> 01:36:29,470
That's fucking it.

2306
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:33,450
I'm angry now.

2307
01:36:33,970 --> 01:36:36,110
I know you can't just kick a grass.

2308
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:41,950
Toki can't just say that.

2309
01:36:42,670 --> 01:36:43,830
That's right.

2310
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:46,150
Wait, I don't have any...

2311
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:46,470
Oh, I do.

2312
01:36:46,470 --> 01:36:47,170
I was like, wait.

2313
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:49,090
I don't have any grass moose.

2314
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:50,310
I don't have any grass moose.

2315
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:51,030
That's right.

2316
01:36:51,390 --> 01:36:52,230
Fine, whip.

2317
01:36:53,130 --> 01:36:54,510
And I'll do it again!

2318
01:36:57,110 --> 01:36:58,390
Get fog rod!

2319
01:37:02,070 --> 01:37:02,650
Yeah!

2320
01:37:03,470 --> 01:37:04,790
Alright, I'll do one more.

2321
01:37:04,810 --> 01:37:07,530
If I don't see the chunky boy, I leave.

2322
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:09,070
God damn it.

2323
01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:10,210
It's all cataracts.

2324
01:37:10,690 --> 01:37:11,410
This ecosystem.

2325
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:13,150
It's an invasive species.

2326
01:37:14,510 --> 01:37:17,710
I refuse to believe they are not an invasive species.

2327
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:19,250
Wait, there's a toad.

2328
01:37:19,910 --> 01:37:21,090
Oh, it's not friendly.

2329
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:23,050
It could work in a break.

2330
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,200
Sailor...

2331
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:30,940
Pormeline.

2332
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:32,040
I would like to battle.

2333
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:33,020
Wait, he has six?

2334
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:34,400
Oh my god!

2335
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:35,900
They're all babies!

2336
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,480
I'm gonna throw the baby.

2337
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,800
I'm gonna throw the baby!

2338
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:49,020
Eat the baby.

2339
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:51,880
Yeah!

2340
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:54,260
I'm level 23.

2341
01:38:03,470 --> 01:38:03,790
Alright.

2342
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:04,390
Shroob.

2343
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:05,310
Where's Shroob?

2344
01:38:07,530 --> 01:38:08,710
Oh my god.

2345
01:38:09,230 --> 01:38:11,110
Wait, what happened to that toad?

2346
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:12,650
Is that like...

2347
01:38:12,650 --> 01:38:14,870
Is that like a Last of Us situation?

2348
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:15,830
Is that...

2349
01:38:15,830 --> 01:38:16,770
Is that Clicker?

2350
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:22,310
Alright.

2351
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:24,190
I'm gonna throw him too.

2352
01:38:25,370 --> 01:38:27,370
I throw all the babies.

2353
01:38:28,490 --> 01:38:29,950
Nothing is safe.

2354
01:38:32,890 --> 01:38:33,390
That's right.

2355
01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:33,990
Get thrown.

2356
01:38:35,770 --> 01:38:37,230
Red, thank you for the super chat.

2357
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:37,610
Thank you.

2358
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:38,270
Thank you.

2359
01:38:38,450 --> 01:38:40,130
Thanks for making me the Red Goon.

2360
01:38:40,270 --> 01:38:42,830
Hopefully the box is nice and comfy.

2361
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:44,530
Thank you for the super chat.

2362
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:44,910
Thank you.

2363
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:46,990
Oh, there's a lot of things happening in that box.

2364
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:48,330
I hope you enjoy it.

2365
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:49,010
Oh my god!

2366
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:49,790
That's him!

2367
01:38:50,110 --> 01:38:51,010
I didn't get to kill...

2368
01:38:51,010 --> 01:38:52,290
I didn't get to catch him!

2369
01:38:53,090 --> 01:38:55,670
Because I didn't get to catch him, I shall kill him.

2370
01:38:58,750 --> 01:38:59,290
Yay!

2371
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:00,050
Oh!

2372
01:39:00,610 --> 01:39:01,530
Whoop, he's a little hurt.

2373
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:06,160
What else?

2374
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:08,640
Okay, let me heal dad real fast.

2375
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:11,420
Alright, it's fine.

2376
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:12,520
I can heal him.

2377
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,060
Uh...

2378
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:16,260
Where's my items?

2379
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:17,280
Super Shroom!

2380
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:18,740
I have enough.

2381
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:22,700
Sorry, thank you for the super chat.

2382
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:23,020
Thank you.

2383
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:23,600
Thank you.

2384
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:24,300
Hey, Doki.

2385
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:26,300
I saw you open your tweet about the P.O.

2386
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:26,700
box.

2387
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:31,520
Would you be interested in having a physical copy of the tabletop care sheet I made you yesterday?

2388
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:32,520
If so I can get...

2389
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:33,380
Yeah, no problem.

2390
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:34,520
You can send whatever you want.

2391
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:35,580
Um...

2392
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:36,100
This is the P.O.

2393
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:36,580
box.

2394
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:39,260
Of course.

2395
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:40,820
Thank you for the super chat.

2396
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:41,140
Thank you.

2397
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:41,700
Thank you.

2398
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:42,360
That's what your P.O.

2399
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:43,060
box is for.

2400
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:45,240
For you guys to send stuff to me if you want.

2401
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:45,260
What?

2402
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:48,260
Get out of here.

2403
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:49,920
You're not even a challenge.

2404
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:54,180
Look how big and strong dad is.

2405
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:55,680
Embargo?

2406
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:57,620
What's that?

2407
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,160
Oh.

2408
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:02,120
That's not a...

2409
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:03,580
That's not a fight item.

2410
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:04,600
Get out of here.

2411
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:05,560
You're not learning, dad.

2412
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:11,580
Alright.

2413
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:12,060
Beanie.

2414
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:12,600
Oh god.

2415
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:14,420
It's the guy in the corner.

2416
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:19,100
Uh.

2417
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:19,720
Darkblade.

2418
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:20,640
Thank you for the super chat.

2419
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:21,000
Thank you.

2420
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:21,620
Thank you.

2421
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:22,660
Today I learned.

2422
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:27,220
Joki and Toadie apparently share a hatred for babies.

2423
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:29,300
Thank you for the super chat.

2424
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:29,800
Thank you.

2425
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:30,620
Thank you.

2426
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:31,640
No, no, no.

2427
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:33,060
I throw everybody.

2428
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,380
Equal rights for everyone.

2429
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:38,720
What the fuck is that?

2430
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,940
It's like a larvae for a fly.

2431
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:41,700
A Jabba.

2432
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:43,240
Wait.

2433
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:44,280
What game is that from?

2434
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:49,630
What a sweat!

2435
01:40:50,510 --> 01:40:51,070
Nice.

2436
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:52,850
I mean, he was the first guy...

2437
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:53,870
Oh my god, Husky Goon!

2438
01:40:53,930 --> 01:40:54,450
You're evolving!

2439
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:55,590
What do you turn into?

2440
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:01,150
Husky Goon is evolving!

2441
01:41:02,650 --> 01:41:03,210
Oh!

2442
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:05,030
Is that the little guys at the bottom?

2443
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:09,320
Yes!

2444
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:10,440
Those guys!

2445
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:12,660
Congratulations!

2446
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:15,580
Your Husky Goon evolved into a munchie!

2447
01:41:16,140 --> 01:41:18,020
Yes, those little guys at the bottom!

2448
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:19,440
They can't touch!

2449
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:21,560
Trying to jar lock.

2450
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:22,600
Okay.

2451
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,240
Is it a good...

2452
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:26,180
prevents the user and the target?

2453
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:27,060
Oh, it's 80!

2454
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:27,840
Wait, that's good.

2455
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,100
Alright, get the snap tree out of here.

2456
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:31,420
Snap trap out of here.

2457
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:33,420
Munch, munch!

2458
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:34,940
Yum yum yum yum yum!

2459
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:37,000
Yeah!

2460
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:41,940
Okay, you're not learning embargo.

2461
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:43,500
Stop trying to learn embargo.

2462
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:45,740
This is like the third time you try to learn it.

2463
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:47,340
I told you!

2464
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:49,900
Mama's not letting you learn embargo!

2465
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:52,660
You're only damage!

2466
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:54,320
That's all you're good for!

2467
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:57,480
You're not going to diamond city that easily!

2468
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,500
Send out Buzzy B!

2469
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:04,360
Okay.

2470
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:06,560
I'm gonna throw you.

2471
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:07,340
Okay, flame.

2472
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:12,000
I forgot.

2473
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:12,760
What is he?

2474
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:13,760
He was dark type, right?

2475
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:15,320
Oh no, he's gonna curse me.

2476
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:17,260
Wait, you speed attack?

2477
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:19,200
Alright, there you go.

2478
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:22,880
Yeah!

2479
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:25,320
That's right.

2480
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,800
You think you can beat me?

2481
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:27,900
And dad?

2482
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:32,680
That's the only one that's actually been fighting!

2483
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:35,620
Oh, he's actually weak to fighting?

2484
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:38,500
I like how I didn't use fighting when I have two fighting moves.

2485
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:42,300
Goddammit!

2486
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:43,780
I don't want you!

2487
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:45,880
I don't want you!

2488
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:47,180
Get out of here!

2489
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:48,400
Get out!

2490
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:52,020
Okay, I have the bros bean.

2491
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:53,700
Huh.

2492
01:42:54,260 --> 01:42:55,440
Is this the right way?

2493
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:57,520
We lost.

2494
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:01,580
I feel like...

2495
01:43:01,580 --> 01:43:04,060
I should be able to break these blocks, right?

2496
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:05,740
Or...

2497
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:06,880
Am I allowed to break those?

2498
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:07,880
Goddammit!

2499
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:09,460
Get out!

2500
01:43:09,620 --> 01:43:11,600
I don't want you here, Catterquack!

2501
01:43:12,740 --> 01:43:14,820
I should be able to break these, right?

2502
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:15,560
Or no?

2503
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:17,160
I can't tell.

2504
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:24,800
Am I allowed to break these?

2505
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,380
Because they're everywhere!

2506
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:29,220
They're an invasive species!

2507
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:33,200
They're like iguanas!

2508
01:43:34,220 --> 01:43:36,940
We're legally allowed to eat iguanas now!

2509
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:39,640
Because they're an invasive species in Florida.

2510
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:41,540
Okay, let's see.

2511
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:42,700
Maybe he'll be back.

2512
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:44,040
Maybe a big boy...

2513
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,560
Oh my god, there's another Catterquack.

2514
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:47,240
No, they're not.

2515
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:49,180
No, they're not!

2516
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:51,320
Mario brought him over!

2517
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,900
Mario loves to talk big!

2518
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:57,560
Especially like he owns Diamond City!

2519
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:02,560
We've got friends everywhere with connections to all sorts of things!

2520
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:04,560
Wait, Wario's in this game?

2521
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:07,660
Oh my god, that means Waluigi's in here!

2522
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:08,520
Wah!

2523
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:14,240
Oh my god, the main character is in this game!

2524
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:16,120
I can't wait!

2525
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:17,780
I can't wait!

2526
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:18,380
I can't wait!

2527
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:20,620
If there's Wadio, there's Waluigi!

2528
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:26,580
The actual main characters!

2529
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:27,520
Wah!

2530
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:32,640
The character that matters the most!

2531
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:35,460
Waluigi!

2532
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:36,540
Maoshi!

2533
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:39,300
When will I have Year of Waluigi?

2534
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:42,540
The beach holds tons of secrets!

2535
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:46,880
Don't be afraid to dig in the sun or poke around the walls!

2536
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:48,620
Oh, I got a big pearl!

2537
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:50,180
How do I dig?

2538
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:52,160
I don't have that.

2539
01:44:57,480 --> 01:44:58,760
I remember when...

2540
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:00,740
My cock limbs had something shimmering.

2541
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,200
A moss hardened a scale value of 10.

2542
01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:05,840
Cubic crystal structure unlike any other.

2543
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:07,660
Nice!

2544
01:45:07,820 --> 01:45:08,820
I got a scuba cap!

2545
01:45:09,940 --> 01:45:12,840
Every year is Year of Waluigi so true!

2546
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:14,840
Isn't the beach beautiful?

2547
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:18,440
The sand is also a really nice temperature!

2548
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:19,660
It's nice!

2549
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:21,100
Nice.

2550
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:24,080
My mind is a temple and a steel trap!

2551
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:26,420
No one can ever learn in secrets!

2552
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:29,040
How'd I become so zen?

2553
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:32,520
This training module for impression taught me everything!

2554
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:34,720
And now I don't need it anymore!

2555
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:35,640
Nice.

2556
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:36,300
I got TM.

2557
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:38,880
You see it.

2558
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:39,920
Thank you for the super chat.

2559
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:40,800
Thank you, thank you.

2560
01:45:40,980 --> 01:45:41,980
You're so zen, guys.

2561
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:43,140
I'm so zen!

2562
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:47,840
He's zen.

2563
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:49,920
Warrior has the strongest...

2564
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:52,460
That was the strangest food request tonight!

2565
01:45:53,260 --> 01:45:55,440
He asked for a fresh corn seed garlic!

2566
01:45:56,020 --> 01:45:58,020
I don't know what that is, so...

2567
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:00,280
I'm here to pretend I'm picking up whatever that is!

2568
01:46:00,940 --> 01:46:02,300
Good job, dude.

2569
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:04,080
I knew I could count on you.

2570
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:06,280
Alright.

2571
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:08,560
Look, there's pearls here, alright?

2572
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,560
Big pearls equals big money.

2573
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:15,680
Enjoying the beauty of War 3-1?

2574
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:19,520
Between the ocean, Diamond City, Skyline, there's a lot to see!

2575
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:20,880
Nice.

2576
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:24,060
Alright, let's see.

2577
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:28,200
Ever take a moment to sit down and breathe?

2578
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:29,520
Rest up?

2579
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:30,780
Let it be now.

2580
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:31,280
Oh, nice.

2581
01:46:31,380 --> 01:46:32,020
He's healing me.

2582
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:32,440
Nice.

2583
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:33,280
Thank you, old man.

2584
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:35,240
I won't step on you.

2585
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:36,440
Don't worry.

2586
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:42,400
Because you healed me, I shall now refrain from stepping on you and killing you.

2587
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:44,400
Cause I'm a nice guy.

2588
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:47,020
Thanks, old man.

2589
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:51,240
God dammit, I wanna fight that big...

2590
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:52,080
Big boy!

2591
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:54,220
Let me...

2592
01:46:54,220 --> 01:46:58,180
Let me fight that big boy and let me enslave him in my...

2593
01:46:58,180 --> 01:46:59,220
In my Pokeball!

2594
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:00,520
Yay!

2595
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:04,000
Yay!

2596
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:05,740
Yay!

2597
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:09,960
Alright.

2598
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:11,680
Water versus water.

2599
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:13,180
Doki.

2600
01:47:18,190 --> 01:47:19,020
He's back!

2601
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:21,240
Alright.

2602
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:22,600
Bubble versus Bubble.

2603
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:25,980
Run, little guy.

2604
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:27,880
You're going to my PC.

2605
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:29,880
The...

2606
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:32,240
Oh wait, it's definitely not effective.

2607
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:34,320
Look, I just thought since we're both...

2608
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:35,800
We're both water...

2609
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,820
Wait, he does so much on...

2610
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:38,260
Okay.

2611
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:39,380
It's cause...

2612
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:40,360
Okay, that makes sense though.

2613
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:42,880
Cafe, thank you for the super chat.

2614
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:43,680
Thank you, thank you.

2615
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:45,660
Thank you for making me the angry son.

2616
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:50,320
I shall enjoy the box of the goons doing angry things for the rest of my days.

2617
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:51,860
Well, back to the grind.

2618
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:54,580
Thank you for the super chat, Cafe.

2619
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:55,720
Thank you, thank you.

2620
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:00,040
Alright, who wants to be my strolling?

2621
01:48:01,540 --> 01:48:02,880
They see him strolling.

2622
01:48:03,860 --> 01:48:04,900
They hating.

2623
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:08,720
To the box with ya!

2624
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:13,800
A tropical cousin to the Goomba that loves to swim and sunbathe.

2625
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,000
Oh, you're like above a Goomba.

2626
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:18,640
You have just a little bit more rights than him.

2627
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:22,460
It wears a bathing suit to the beach because it has amazing...

2628
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:23,140
Wait, amazing?

2629
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:27,200
Wait, does that mean Goombas are purposely naked?

2630
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:29,380
It's a choice?

2631
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:35,220
You think Goombas are naked as a choice?

2632
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:38,000
Oh, yeah.

2633
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:41,020
Oh, yeah.

2634
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:45,820
Like, strolling is like, wear his clothes because it's black.

2635
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:46,860
Whoa.

2636
01:48:50,020 --> 01:48:53,500
Alright, who wants to be a strolling?

2637
01:48:56,180 --> 01:48:58,020
It's a tactic of...

2638
01:48:58,020 --> 01:49:00,100
What's the tactics to be naked?

2639
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:01,280

01:49:04,820 --> 01:49:06,940

Let's see...

2643
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:14,720
I'm already forgetting which one I...

2644
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:16,360
Like, who are in the box right now.

2645
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:18,020
I haven't looked at them in a long time.

2646
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:18,560
It's been...

2647
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:24,540
Husky, thank you for the aca, Supa.

01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:25,520
Thank you, thank you.

2649
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:27,360
Shul and Stu is my little baby.

2650
01:49:27,620 --> 01:49:29,560
Here's an aca for giving him a home.

2651
01:49:29,740 --> 01:49:31,620
Yes, the PC dungeon counts.

2652
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:33,380
Thank you for the aca, Supa.

2653
01:49:33,580 --> 01:49:34,760

Okay, because you said, please, I'll let you be Stu.

2657
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:45,080
Alright.

2658
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:46,100
Let's see.

2659
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,400
Snaz goon.

2660
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:52,440
Snaz.

2661
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:56,180
Because you were polite just like this...

2662
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:58,360
Just like the strolling for wearing clothes.

2663
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:00,680
There you go.

2664
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:01,880
Snaz goon.

2665
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:09,160
Oh, he's out of the car.

2666
01:50:10,760 --> 01:50:11,720
Woah, woah, woah!

2667
01:50:12,180 --> 01:50:13,940
I'm practicing my drifts!

2668
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:14,840
Alright.

2669
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:18,540
Oh my god!

2670
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:19,640
Bro!

2671
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:21,000
That's cool.

2672
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:23,760
Woah, he's so cool.

2673
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,160
He's drifting, buddy.

2674
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:26,460
Look at him drift.

2675
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:29,180
Damn.

2676
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:32,420
Oh my god, he's Akira drifting.

2677
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:34,980
Tokyo Drift.

2678
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:40,100
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

2679
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:41,060
Thank you, thank you.

2680
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:42,260
Can I join the PC?

2681
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:45,000
Don't worry, you'll be named next.

2682
01:50:45,660 --> 01:50:46,220
Whichever...

2683
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:47,840
Whichever one...

2684
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:50,700
New Mon I encounter, you get the next name, Mike.

2685
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52,960
It'll be very unfortunate though.

2686
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:53,540
Whichever...

2687
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:56,460
Oh, that's the best part about the RNG of it too.

2688
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:59,200
You don't know which one I'm gonna encounter next.

2689
01:50:59,200 --> 01:50:59,820
That's new.

2690
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,480
It could be anyone.

2691
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:10,060
Yeah.

2692
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:12,100
Diamond City is the perfect target.

2693
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:14,280
They're already so busy with Wario.

2694
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:16,620
I'll never suspect another thief.

2695
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:17,020
Yeah.

2696
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,180
Let's go gambling!

2697
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:23,900
What if I just name you after?

2698
01:51:23,980 --> 01:51:25,680
What if I just go back and find...

2699
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:26,980
That one guy.

2700
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:31,740
You know that guy I'm talking about.

2701
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:33,480
I have three of them.

2702
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:34,220
I need more.

2703
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:35,120
I need two more.

2704
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,140
The pinata sleeps peacefully in the cliff side.

2705
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:40,640
Sleep talk?

2706
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:41,700
Which capture?

2707
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:43,620
Wait, what?

2708
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:45,680
Able to what?

2709
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:49,580
Alright, who am I giving up?

2710
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:49,880
Okay.

2711
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:52,720
Alright, Brogoon.

2712
01:51:52,980 --> 01:51:53,400
Oh!

2713
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:54,740
Sleep talk.

2714
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:55,740
Oh no.

2715
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:57,180
You're not learning that.

2716
01:51:58,620 --> 01:51:59,800
We don't need that.

2717
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:03,200
Hey, heading to Diamond City?

2718
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:04,460
It's just over there.

2719
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:08,620
I'm just growing a little garden away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

2720
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:09,960
Okay.

2721
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:11,020
Is it here?

2722
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:17,960
You should check out the purple areas or the WarioWare Inc.

2723
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:18,420
Oh!

2724
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:19,640
It's the WarioWare!

2725
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:21,580
Welcome to Diamond City!

2726
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:22,860
Hey, wait a minute.

2727
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:26,360
You seem to be one of those people who are competing in the current challenge for PyroStars.

2728
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:27,400
Am I correct?

2729
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:31,380
In that case, mind if I ask you a few things for the show I'm doing?

2730
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:32,220
Great!

2731
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:33,740
Let's get started then!

2732
01:52:34,380 --> 01:52:34,860
Oh!

2733
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:37,560
What do I feel like?

2734
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:40,340
Where's my miss?

2735
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:45,500
I feel...

2736
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:51,160
Why?

2737
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:55,680
Great!

2738
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,040
Thanks a lot, Mario!

2739
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:58,140
Oh, wow!

2740
01:52:58,320 --> 01:52:59,700
I didn't realize it was you!

2741
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:03,100
Although, I guess the overalls and mustache should have given away.

2742
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:07,120
But last I made that mistake, ended up being a brother Luigi!

2743
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:10,880
Well, I hope you enjoy your stay in Diamond City, Mario!

2744
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:11,800
Why?

2745
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:14,320
Why am I here?

2746
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:15,620
What is my purpose?

2747
01:53:16,740 --> 01:53:17,220
Pitchville!

2748
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:17,840
Viva!

2749
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:19,340
I'm loving it!

2750
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:20,720
Nice, good for you.

2751
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:24,820
Alright, talk to me, Toad.

2752
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:25,960
I'll stop you right here.

2753
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:27,180
Whee!

2754
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:32,140
There sure is a lot of different environments in Diamond City for me to play in!

2755
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:33,380
Hey!

2756
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:35,300
You looking to get around Diamond City?

2757
01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:41,320
The DCL Diamond City lift can help you for the cost of just 500 quarts!

2758
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:42,900
How big is...

2759
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:43,880
There's a daycare!

2760
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:48,060
Wait...

2761
01:53:48,060 --> 01:53:49,400
There's a daycare!

2762
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:54,240
Oh, no!

2763
01:53:55,420 --> 01:53:59,080
The beach provides good resistance training for the annual Diamond City Triathlon!

2764
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:00,780
Oh, no!

2765
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:04,280
Oh, I found a daycare, guys!

2766
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:05,440
I...

2767
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:08,560
Wait, no, that's just a garden!

2768
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:09,640
Goddammit!

2769
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:10,200
Yeah!

2770
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:14,580
Hey there!

2771
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:15,780
Feeling lost in Big City?

2772
01:54:16,120 --> 01:54:16,920
Well, don't worry!

2773
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:17,880
We're offing free...

2774
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:18,380
Oh, nice!

2775
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:19,960
Oh!

2776
01:54:21,060 --> 01:54:22,020
I'm a Yoshi!

2777
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,140
Oh my god!

2778
01:54:26,380 --> 01:54:27,160
Look at him go!

2779
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:30,640
Have you heard of a Yoshi whistle?

2780
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:33,240
I'll let you ride a Yoshi anytime you want!

2781
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:36,320
I don't think they're offered anywhere here in Diamond City, though.

2782
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:37,880
Wait, where do I get a Yoshi whistle?

2783
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:39,720
I want a Yoshi whistle!

2784
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:40,800
Look at him go!

2785
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:42,220
Whee!

2786
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:46,160
I need to find this daycare, guys.

2787
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:48,300
That's like our first mission in life.

2788
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:50,700
Hey there!

2789
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:51,700
New to Diamond City?

2790
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:55,060
I recommend checking out the various signs or talking to the toads and carts.

2791
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:57,960
The city is way too big and confusing.

2792
01:54:58,140 --> 01:54:58,880
You're new around here.

2793
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:01,320
So don't be afraid to ask for help.

2794
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:03,660
I talked to any of these?

2795
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:07,460
Mario Games Studio makes some questionable video games.

2796
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:10,960
I thought he was making something to rival Pydomon.

2797
01:55:11,140 --> 01:55:14,280
But I just know it's going to be a bad knockoff.

2798
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:14,940
Oops, sorry.

2799
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:15,660
That's not what I want.

2800
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:17,220
I love Diamond...

2801
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:18,340
I love Diamond City!

2802
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:21,360
But I don't think it's the same about Diamond Suburbs!

2803
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:25,140
Cities are engines of creativity and wealth creation.

2804
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:35,080
And low-density suburbs or conserves exist to extract that wealth then use it to support wasteful, inefficient, and environmentally harmful lifestyles!

2805
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:36,200
Read it out!

2806
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:36,400
Read it out!

2807
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:37,300
What the fuck?

2808
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:40,700
I did not expect that in my Mario game.

2809
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:42,320
Want me to crash...

2810
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:42,740
Wait, okay.

2811
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:43,260
Let's...

2812
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:43,760
Let's save it.

2813
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:46,840
All right.

2814
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:52,440
Before we crash the game, let me save this game real fast.

2815
01:55:52,580 --> 01:55:52,920
All right.

2816
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:53,880
Sure.

2817
01:55:54,340 --> 01:55:54,880
Well, too bad.

2818
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:55,800
I don't know actually...

2819
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:57,760
Okay, I don't actually know how to.

2820
01:55:58,240 --> 01:55:58,780
How do you...

2821
01:55:58,780 --> 01:55:59,540
Okay, you know what?

2822
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:01,420
How much money do I have?

2823
01:56:01,460 --> 01:56:01,980
Oh, I have enough.

2824
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:02,440
It's fine.

2825
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:03,460
Let's go to the daycare.

2826
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:09,860
I'm the daycare man.

2827
01:56:10,060 --> 01:56:10,920
I'll take care...

2828
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:12,200
You like me to raise your captures?

2829
01:56:12,580 --> 01:56:13,980
Have a word with the woman.

2830
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:15,220
It's time.

2831
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:19,600
Yes.

2832
01:56:20,300 --> 01:56:20,940
All right.

2833
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:24,180
We're shooting this stuff.

2834
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:26,380
Okay, so we need the mail.

2835
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:34,120
What do we need more?

2836
01:56:35,980 --> 01:56:36,600
No.

2837
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:37,500
No.

2838
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:38,700
No.

2839
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:38,740
Wait.

2840
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:40,220
Let's...

2841
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:46,000
Okay.

2842
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:47,020
All right.

2843
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:49,080
Let's see.

2844
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:49,960
You know what?

2845
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:50,320
All right.

2846
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:51,040
Let's put...

2847
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:51,500
All right.

2848
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:53,080
We'll put you in custody.

2849
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:53,820
Let's see.

2850
01:56:53,820 --> 01:56:55,800
I would like...

2851
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,460
I would like...

2852
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:57,400
Gus.

2853
01:56:58,080 --> 01:56:58,820
All right.

2854
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:00,940
Let's put you here for now.

2855
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:01,820
And then...

2856
01:57:02,540 --> 01:57:03,140
Wait.

2857
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:03,820
Was that male?

2858
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:04,580
Oh, wait.

2859
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:05,520
It has to be female.

2860
01:57:05,740 --> 01:57:05,960
I forgot.

2861
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:07,340
You're lucky today.

2862
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:09,260
You're so lucky today.

2863
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:12,140
All right.

2864
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,120
We'll put John.

2865
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:15,080
And then...

2866
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:17,100
Also, we need Gus in here.

2867
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:17,980
Don't worry.

2868
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:20,860
Don't worry, Gus.

2869
01:57:20,860 --> 01:57:20,980
Gus.

2870
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:22,920
You'll have a good time.

2871
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:27,420
Oh, but don't worry.

2872
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:28,720
It's not gonna ruin anything.

2873
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:30,620
Because I still have these two.

2874
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:31,920
All right.

2875
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:35,720
All right.

2876
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:37,800
Let's put Gus in here.

2877
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:42,570
Wait.

2878
01:57:42,670 --> 01:57:42,950
Chosen.

2879
01:57:43,310 --> 01:57:44,250
How do I choose?

2880
01:57:45,210 --> 01:57:45,770
Okay.

2881
01:57:47,630 --> 01:57:48,190
Yes.

2882
01:57:54,550 --> 01:57:55,290
Oh, race.

2883
01:57:55,430 --> 01:57:56,250
Come back to the little.

2884
01:57:56,410 --> 01:57:57,210
He can race too.

2885
01:57:57,350 --> 01:57:57,630
Yes.

2886
01:57:59,010 --> 01:57:59,770
All right.

2887
01:58:00,050 --> 01:58:01,390
Hello, Gus and John.

2888
01:58:01,410 --> 01:58:03,010
I hope you have fun in there.

2889
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:04,230
All right.

2890
01:58:08,310 --> 01:58:09,910
They'll have lots of fun.

2891
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:10,250
No.

2892
01:58:10,470 --> 01:58:12,830
Don't take me off the couch.

2893
01:58:14,090 --> 01:58:14,610
Gus.

2894
01:58:14,710 --> 01:58:16,730
Thank you for the magenta sofa.

2895
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:17,890
Thank you.

2896
01:58:18,050 --> 01:58:19,630
It's too late, Gus.

2897
01:58:20,630 --> 01:58:21,870
It's too late.

2898
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:23,990
Cosmic.

2899
01:58:24,170 --> 01:58:25,630
Thank you for the super chat.

2900
01:58:25,830 --> 01:58:26,210
Thank you.

2901
01:58:26,370 --> 01:58:27,010
Thank you.

2902
01:58:27,770 --> 01:58:29,310
Are you guys having fun?

2903
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:36,220
Oh.

2904
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:41,100
The two prefer to play with other captures than each other.

2905
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:42,440
Oh.

2906
01:58:42,540 --> 01:58:44,840
You guys are not compatible.

2907
01:58:46,140 --> 01:58:47,300
All right.

2908
01:58:48,660 --> 01:58:49,820
You're lucky.

2909
01:58:49,820 --> 01:58:51,400
You're not compatible.

2910
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:53,580
You're so lucky.

2911
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:54,620
All right.

2912
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:56,100
We need another male in there.

2913
01:58:56,420 --> 01:58:57,220
You know what?

2914
01:58:58,440 --> 01:58:59,160
E-Dragon.

2915
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:00,500
You're getting lucky tonight.

2916
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:06,480
You're getting lucky tonight.

2917
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,240
You're getting lucky tonight.

2918
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:11,300
Oh, wait.

2919
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:11,980
You're still dead.

2920
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:14,220
I forgot.

2921
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:16,580
I forgot.

2922
01:59:16,580 --> 01:59:17,860
I forgot.

2923
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:18,280
I forgot you.

2924
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:19,380
I killed you.

2925
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:24,000
It's okay.

2926
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,040
You'll be back to normal.

2927
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:27,240
All right.

2928
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:29,780
Oh, yeah.

2929
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:30,780
I forgot about that.

2930
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:31,800
It was so long ago.

2931
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:32,880
Yes.

2932
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:34,500
I'll take away.

2933
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:35,900
What am I taking away?

2934
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:37,160
I'm taking away.

2935
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:39,900
What's so...

2936
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:40,440
Who...

2937
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:42,740
It was Gus, right?

2938
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:43,060
Yeah.

2939
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:43,780
It was Gus.

2940
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:44,180
Yes.

2941
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:45,780
All right.

2942
01:59:45,860 --> 01:59:46,740
Give me back Gus.

2943
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:49,120
All right.

2944
01:59:50,910 --> 01:59:51,220
No.

2945
01:59:53,930 --> 01:59:54,240
Yes.

2946
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:56,620
I need to erase my...

2947
01:59:56,620 --> 01:59:57,980
My dead...

2948
01:59:57,980 --> 01:59:58,900
Dragoon.

2949
01:59:59,340 --> 01:59:59,620
All right.

2950
02:00:02,840 --> 02:00:03,640
All right.

2951
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:07,020
No!

2952
02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:11,260
Is it because he's dead?

2953
02:00:11,780 --> 02:00:12,720
Is it...

2954
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:13,900
Is it...

2955
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:14,900
Is it...

2956
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:17,160
Is it because he's dead?

2957
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:18,680
Don't worry.

2958
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:20,840
I'll find...

2959
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:21,820
Don't worry.

2960
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:23,300
We have lots of options.

2961
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:24,480
We have...

2962
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:25,540
All right.

2963
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:26,400
Goodbye Gus.

2964
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:28,240
Don't worry.

2965
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:29,060
We have...

2966
02:00:29,060 --> 02:00:29,740
Oh my God.

2967
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:31,300
You need...

2968
02:00:31,300 --> 02:00:31,900
You need a...

2969
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:33,220
Need a bean in your life?

2970
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:34,100
Is that it?

2971
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:35,100
I need...

2972
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:36,240
John...

2973
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:37,100
Is that...

2974
02:00:37,100 --> 02:00:37,920
Don't worry.

2975
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,540
I have a bean in here too.

2976
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:42,240
One of them will work.

2977
02:00:44,020 --> 02:00:45,340
I have smurf goon.

2978
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:47,840
One of you will be satisfied.

2979
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:50,020
All right.

2980
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:50,680
Who am I taking?

2981
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:51,680
I was taking the dragon.

2982
02:00:51,860 --> 02:00:52,000
Okay.

2983
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:52,320
Yeah.

2984
02:00:56,420 --> 02:00:58,320
We'll find you that special goon.

2985
02:00:58,420 --> 02:00:58,980
Don't worry.

2986
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:00,000
Don't worry.

2987
02:01:00,120 --> 02:01:02,000
I'll find you your special goon.

2988
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,920
Oh wait.

2989
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:05,780
You're back to life.

2990
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:09,120
All right.

2991
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:11,740
Maybe you'll love each other now.

2992
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:15,220
What?

2993
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:18,380
What is your compatibility rate?

2994
02:01:22,060 --> 02:01:24,540
Why won't you love?

2995
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:28,600
I need to find your true love.

2996
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:30,540
I need to find your true love.

2997
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:32,600
What do you love?

2998
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:35,320
What will you love?

2999
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:37,740
This goon is really picky.

3000
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:42,140
I'll find your true love.

3001
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:43,400
Don't worry.

3002
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:45,080
All right.

3003
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:46,800
We have a lot of options.

3004
02:01:47,080 --> 02:01:47,880
We have two...

3005
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:48,840
We have three more...

3006
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:49,560
Two more options.

3007
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:51,440
We have...

3008
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:52,620
Tips and Alan.

3009
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:54,720
One of them will love each other.

3010
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:56,040
I believe.

3011
02:01:57,060 --> 02:01:58,460
I'm not giving up.

3012
02:01:58,560 --> 02:01:59,760
I'll find love for you.

3013
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:01,960
I'll use my entire money.

3014
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:03,340
I'll find you love.

3015
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:05,800
If it's the last day I do.

3016
02:02:10,140 --> 02:02:11,200
Don't worry.

3017
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:14,480
You will find love.

3018
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:20,060
All right.

3019
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:22,200
No.

3020
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:22,280
No.

3021
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:22,700
Okay.

3022
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:24,240
All right.

3023
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:26,500
Does he love?

3024
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:28,500
No!

3025
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:32,180
You still don't have love in your heart!

3026
02:02:36,030 --> 02:02:37,090
I don't understand!

3027
02:02:37,110 --> 02:02:39,050
There's so many suitors!

3028
02:02:40,330 --> 02:02:41,990
I'm literally playing like that.

3029
02:02:42,050 --> 02:02:43,610
You know that dating show?

3030
02:02:43,870 --> 02:02:45,170
With like one...

3031
02:02:45,170 --> 02:02:47,110
One woman and a hundred guys.

3032
02:02:47,110 --> 02:02:48,570
And then they give a rose?

3033
02:02:48,570 --> 02:02:49,950
I'm doing that right now.

3034
02:02:50,350 --> 02:02:51,110
Like I...

3035
02:02:52,570 --> 02:02:53,010
I'm...

3036
02:02:53,990 --> 02:02:54,430
I'm...

3037
02:02:54,430 --> 02:02:55,410
This is...

3038
02:02:55,410 --> 02:02:56,990
This is what I'm doing right now.

3039
02:02:57,070 --> 02:02:57,230
Yeah.

3040
02:02:57,410 --> 02:02:58,110
This is the Bachelorette.

3041
02:02:58,970 --> 02:02:59,570
Right now.

3042
02:02:59,730 --> 02:03:00,770
With fucking John.

3043
02:03:02,790 --> 02:03:04,570
We're doing the Bachelorette.

3044
02:03:06,870 --> 02:03:07,410
Yeah.

3045
02:03:08,390 --> 02:03:08,770
All right.

3046
02:03:09,510 --> 02:03:11,430
Actually, we'll try to rock first.

3047
02:03:12,190 --> 02:03:13,450
Maybe he'll like rocks.

3048
02:03:13,610 --> 02:03:14,130
I don't know.

3049
02:03:17,630 --> 02:03:20,850
We're trying to find a perfect match.

3050
02:03:22,710 --> 02:03:23,730
All right.

3051
02:03:24,290 --> 02:03:24,470
Tips.

3052
02:03:24,890 --> 02:03:25,810
You go in there.

3053
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:29,230
All right.

3054
02:03:31,790 --> 02:03:32,930
Are you found love?

3055
02:03:32,930 --> 02:03:33,930
No!

3056
02:03:35,370 --> 02:03:36,570
Still nothing!

3057
02:03:37,590 --> 02:03:38,650
Why?

3058
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:46,420
Why don't you like anything?

3059
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:50,300
Don't worry.

3060
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:53,840
Okay.

3061
02:03:55,120 --> 02:03:55,700
No.

3062
02:03:56,220 --> 02:03:56,340
Okay.

3063
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:56,740
Wait, wait.

3064
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:58,400
We still have one more.

3065
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:00,100
Our Hail Mary.

3066
02:04:00,780 --> 02:04:02,240
We have...

3067
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:02,820
Alan.

3068
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:06,860
If you don't fall in love...

3069
02:04:06,860 --> 02:04:08,240
Then it's hopeless.

3070
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:10,260
You were never meant to fall in love.

3071
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:14,000
You were never meant to find anybody.

3072
02:04:16,940 --> 02:04:17,580
Okay.

3073
02:04:18,120 --> 02:04:19,420
Our last Hail Mary.

3074
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:24,060
All right.

3075
02:04:24,580 --> 02:04:25,020
Alan.

3076
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:25,940
Go in there.

3077
02:04:27,420 --> 02:04:28,460
Show him.

3078
02:04:28,580 --> 02:04:30,020
Show him what love is.

3079
02:04:34,060 --> 02:04:34,700
No!

3080
02:04:37,740 --> 02:04:38,520
No!

3081
02:04:40,100 --> 02:04:40,360
No!

3082
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:45,400
John, you're gonna die alone.

3083
02:04:49,340 --> 02:04:51,200
I'm sorry, John.

3084
02:04:52,550 --> 02:04:56,540
I have to catch more mons until you find your perfect match.

3085
02:04:56,900 --> 02:04:58,400
Forever alone.

3086
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:00,620
Well then.

3087
02:05:00,620 --> 02:05:00,720
Well then.

3088
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:02,540
Unfortunately.

3089
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:05,460
John was not satisfied.

3090
02:05:06,260 --> 02:05:08,780
With any of our suitors.

3091
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:11,880
He has not found love.

3092
02:05:13,960 --> 02:05:15,820
Don't worry, John.

3093
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:18,060
I will catch more.

3094
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:20,900
I will find your husband though.

3095
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:22,380
Don't worry.

3096
02:05:22,380 --> 02:05:23,720
Hehehehe.

3097
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:25,340
Hehehehe.

3098
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:28,520
Every Monday.

3099
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:31,700
Jimmy T host Pilates at Club Sugar.

3100
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:33,960
Gotta burn that weekend sweat off.

3101
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:35,780
Where am I?

3102
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:36,840
Hehehehe.

3103
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:39,700
Like... Oh.

3104
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,720
Oh my god, there's so many.

3105
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:45,060
Oh my superstars!

3106
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:47,260
I can't believe I'm talking to Mario!

3107
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:50,660
Please, take a complimentary gift from the department store!

3108
02:05:50,940 --> 02:05:51,320
Nice.

3109
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:55,700
Wait, no, isn't Maddie the female?

3110
02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:59,080
Did you know a place where you get some really good soup?

3111
02:05:59,480 --> 02:06:00,760
Asking for a friend!

3112
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:04,460
I thought it was female in here.

3113
02:06:09,740 --> 02:06:13,160
Oh, you mean that?

3114
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:16,380
Oh, wait, I could... You're right!

3115
02:06:18,620 --> 02:06:20,020
Wait, you're right!

3116
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:22,380
You're right!

3117
02:06:27,130 --> 02:06:28,190
I forgot.

3118
02:06:29,450 --> 02:06:31,810
Maybe I was going at it all wrong.

3119
02:06:32,350 --> 02:06:34,490
I shouldn't have tried to intermix.

3120
02:06:40,590 --> 02:06:43,170
I was going at it all wrong.

3121
02:06:44,430 --> 02:06:45,430
Alright.

3122
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:50,020
This is it.

3123
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Alright.

3124
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:55,480
Let's see.

3125
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:00,800
Yay!

3126
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:03,480
We found your true love!

3127
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:08,740
Let's go!

3128
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:08,920
Let's go!

3129
02:07:10,160 --> 02:07:12,820
He picked the bachelorette!

3130
02:07:13,340 --> 02:07:14,380
The bachelorette!

3131
02:07:16,700 --> 02:07:17,920
Many did it!

3132
02:07:18,040 --> 02:07:19,460
They found true love!

3133
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:22,160
We did it, guys!

3134
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:23,940
True love is real!

3135
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:27,620
Oh my god, true love is real!

3136
02:07:34,820 --> 02:07:36,440
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

3137
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:36,740
Thank you.

3138
02:07:36,860 --> 02:07:37,180
Thank you.

3139
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:40,940
I panicked, but then I realized it was John, the goon, who's laying this treatment.

3140
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:43,100
Who, I dodged a bullet.

3141
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:45,820
I'm looking for a gift from my grandson.

3142
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:48,200
He really likes these energy drinks.

3143
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:49,660
His favorite celery promotes.

3144
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,500
But I can't seem to find it.

3145
02:07:51,660 --> 02:07:54,440
He talks a lot about the kiyot flavor.

3146
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:55,240
No!

3147
02:07:55,860 --> 02:07:57,900
Not the kiyot flavor.

3148
02:07:57,900 --> 02:07:58,380
I don't believe it.

3149
02:07:59,660 --> 02:07:59,780
Oh.

3150
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:01,940
I need a capture.

3151
02:08:02,100 --> 02:08:02,680
Is he a zebra flap?

3152
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:03,700
Yeah, I wanna try.

3153
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:05,400
What did I get?

3154
02:08:09,080 --> 02:08:09,480
29119.

3155
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:10,300
Do I have any?

3156
02:08:12,740 --> 02:08:14,200
Cosmic, thank you for the super chat.

3157
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:14,560
Thank you.

3158
02:08:14,700 --> 02:08:15,180
Thank you.

3159
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:16,620
Aw, we don't have any.

3160
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:18,060
Who is that?

3161
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:20,000
Mehdi and John are meant for each other.

3162
02:08:20,240 --> 02:08:21,340
Thank you for the super chat.

3163
02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:21,680
Thank you.

3164
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,160
Thank you.

3165
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:24,300
This department store has everything I asked for.

3166
02:08:24,580 --> 02:08:27,140
Except whatever that old toad is asking for it.

3167
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:28,400
Oh, the kiyot flavor.

3168
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:32,940
I wonder if I should read these.

3169
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:35,780
I'm a little disappointed I can't buy super barrel caps here.

3170
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:36,840
It's not a big deal.

3171
02:08:37,060 --> 02:08:40,200
That just gives me an excuse to visit toasterina.

3172
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:42,220
Alright, what do they have?

3173
02:08:42,500 --> 02:08:42,940
Mushrooms.

3174
02:08:43,100 --> 02:08:44,220
Okay, I don't need any of that.

3175
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:45,800
I need more caps though.

3176
02:08:47,820 --> 02:08:48,300
Okay.

3177
02:08:48,900 --> 02:08:49,740
Higher rate.

3178
02:08:50,160 --> 02:08:50,640
Restores.

3179
02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:52,160
Better unlowered.

3180
02:08:52,220 --> 02:08:53,700
Oh my god, the party hat.

3181
02:08:54,380 --> 02:08:56,860
A cap that works better in captures recorded before.

3182
02:08:57,580 --> 02:09:00,100
That makes captures more friendly and fancy.

3183
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:02,040
Oh my god, a fancy boy.

3184
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:03,260
Okay, we'll get a baseball cap.

3185
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:05,500
How much can I buy?

3186
02:09:05,700 --> 02:09:06,060
Seven?

3187
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:06,740
Yeah.

3188
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:08,280
I spent all my money.

3189
02:09:08,540 --> 02:09:11,860
I spent all my money right now, even though there's more to this place.

3190
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:16,040
Okay, they're just talking about...

3191
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:18,540
We don't need to read that.

3192
02:09:18,820 --> 02:09:19,780
That's not important.

3193
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:21,980
I like how I spent all my money now.

3194
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:23,060
Now I can't buy anything.

3195
02:09:28,620 --> 02:09:29,060
Whoops.

3196
02:09:29,900 --> 02:09:31,880
Oh, it's like the X attack and stuff.

3197
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:34,500
Speed bean!

3198
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:35,220
Speed bean!

3199
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:41,660
Beans are a great way to boost the effort values of captures, but they're pretty expensive.

3200
02:09:41,860 --> 02:09:45,780
Some people prefer reliable training over drugs.

3201
02:09:46,900 --> 02:09:47,380
Wait.

3202
02:09:48,060 --> 02:09:48,760
Oh.

3203
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:53,300
Oh, I can just use this over and over for EV training shit.

3204
02:09:53,540 --> 02:09:54,620
I don't care about that.

3205
02:09:57,500 --> 02:09:57,940
Hmm.

3206
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:02,400
There sure are a lot of different ways the species of our world can evolve and become stronger.

3207
02:10:02,700 --> 02:10:06,080
But just because someone can evolve, doesn't mean that they always should.

3208
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:08,940
In fact, this item here makes captures stronger.

3209
02:10:09,140 --> 02:10:11,060
And they're not yet at their full potential.

3210
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:13,200
Here, why don't you have it?

3211
02:10:13,580 --> 02:10:14,460
Evil light?

3212
02:10:14,700 --> 02:10:15,460
What's that?

3213
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:18,420
Don't worry, I have no use for that stone.

3214
02:10:18,420 --> 02:10:20,180
I'm not even a commander.

3215
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:25,240
Oh, okay, so that's for my Yoshi's.

3216
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:26,800
Oh, yeah!

3217
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:30,980
We don't need any of these guys.

3218
02:10:32,140 --> 02:10:35,320
My Yoshi is gonna grow up big and strong.

3219
02:10:35,660 --> 02:10:37,280
The natural way.

3220
02:10:38,460 --> 02:10:39,700
Alright, let's put it on.

3221
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:41,040
Let's give the item to Dad.

3222
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:43,320
Since he's not fully evolved yet, right?

3223
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:45,600
Yeah.

3224
02:10:49,780 --> 02:10:51,260
Mehdi, thank you for the super chat.

3225
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:51,640
Thank you.

3226
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:52,040
Thank you.

3227
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:52,820
No, no, no.

3228
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:53,880
Get away from...

3229
02:10:54,340 --> 02:10:55,060
Well, I'm sorry.

3230
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:58,020
You're apparently the perfect match made in heaven.

3231
02:10:59,260 --> 02:10:59,940
Aye, aye, aye.

3232
02:11:01,420 --> 02:11:02,080
What's this?

3233
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:03,960
What does he sell?

3234
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:05,180
Oh, he sells TMs.

3235
02:11:06,220 --> 02:11:07,020
How about you?

3236
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:09,080
Also TMs.

3237
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:11,140
I don't care about TMs, though.

3238
02:11:12,980 --> 02:11:13,880
Oh, nice.

3239
02:11:14,020 --> 02:11:14,420
Free TM.

3240
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:17,840
Too bad I don't care about TMs.

3241
02:11:20,260 --> 02:11:21,980
I don't need to use...

3242
02:11:21,980 --> 02:11:26,320
I don't need to use special discs to make my mom stronger.

3243
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:31,440
He's gonna be strong through the things he learned in my training.

3244
02:11:33,340 --> 02:11:35,820
Suffering from recess.

3245
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:38,000
Mehdi, thank you for the super chat.

3246
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:38,500
Thank you.

3247
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:39,260
Thank you.

3248
02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:40,240
You know what?

3249
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:41,480
Make the departments are great!

3250
02:11:41,820 --> 02:11:43,380
A Sierra floor we can blow up!

3251
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:48,360
The magic of Sierra is you're eating and drinking at the same time with one hand.

3252
02:11:49,380 --> 02:11:50,420
Alright, now I'm up here.

3253
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:56,260
The view from here is nice, but being so high up scares me.

3254
02:11:56,860 --> 02:12:00,780
Sometimes it's better to just get to the ground and rest, don't you think?

3255
02:12:00,780 --> 02:12:04,040
I'm sure your captures would like to do so as well.

3256
02:12:04,380 --> 02:12:05,620
Why do I teach you how to use...

3257
02:12:05,620 --> 02:12:06,340
No, it's fine.

3258
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:12,620
Alright, all I'm saying is that what if it was the guys that were rejecting John?

3259
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:12,720
One.

3260
02:12:16,360 --> 02:12:18,700
And you are the only goon...

3261
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:20,560
That accepted.

3262
02:12:24,700 --> 02:12:28,780
What if it was everyone else with very high expectations?

3263
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:32,660
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

3264
02:12:32,700 --> 02:12:33,380
Is this a gang?

3265
02:12:37,290 --> 02:12:38,330
Oh, they're all there.

3266
02:12:39,930 --> 02:12:42,710
Oh, they're all like the tower goombas.

3267
02:12:45,330 --> 02:12:46,810
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

3268
02:12:46,950 --> 02:12:47,810
Thank you, thank you.

3269
02:12:48,290 --> 02:12:49,750
We dodged a bullet, Toki.

3270
02:12:49,990 --> 02:12:50,670
Thank God.

3271
02:12:51,270 --> 02:12:52,250
Thank you for the super chat.

3272
02:12:52,410 --> 02:12:53,310
Thank you, thank you.

3273
02:12:59,860 --> 02:13:00,260
Alright.

3274
02:13:01,940 --> 02:13:03,900
They're all naked on top of each other.

3275
02:13:06,240 --> 02:13:07,500
Where am I?

3276
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:09,600
Where the fuck am I?

3277
02:13:11,100 --> 02:13:13,060
Where is this place?

3278
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:14,120
Okay.

3279
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:16,340
Alright, this is where I started.

3280
02:13:16,580 --> 02:13:17,400
Okay, this is where...

3281
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:19,420
There's like several Pokemon centers.

3282
02:13:19,980 --> 02:13:20,980
Holy fuck.

3283
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:25,120
Club sugar at a rental facility.

3284
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:26,320
Where do I go first?

3285
02:13:29,820 --> 02:13:31,260
Heat all my roof, please.

3286
02:13:31,540 --> 02:13:33,400
I'm trying to boost my speed and HP.

3287
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:34,760
Hey, you.

3288
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:35,780
Where do you think you're going?

3289
02:13:35,780 --> 02:13:37,620
Oh, it's Ashley's house!

3290
02:13:38,300 --> 02:13:41,660
I don't recall any mustached individuals being invited.

3291
02:13:43,260 --> 02:13:44,220
I love...

3292
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:46,080
I love Ashley's song.

3293
02:13:47,240 --> 02:13:48,200
Um, what's...

3294
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:48,820
Oh my God.

3295
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:51,140
There's like this cover song of Ashley's song.

3296
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:51,940
And it's so good.

3297
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:53,020
Wait, let me see if I can find it.

3298
02:13:53,260 --> 02:13:54,660
It's actually one of my favorite songs.

3299
02:13:56,240 --> 02:13:56,700
Uh...

3300
02:13:56,700 --> 02:13:58,480
I need to pause just to show you guys it.

3301
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:00,160
Ashley...

3302
02:14:01,100 --> 02:14:02,020
Ashley's song.

3303
02:14:04,040 --> 02:14:04,500
Uh...

3304
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:05,640
Oh my God.

3305
02:14:05,660 --> 02:14:06,600
It's so good.

3306
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:07,940
But I'm trying to remember...

3307
02:14:07,940 --> 02:14:08,920
Is it a jazz cover?

3308
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:10,180
I'm gonna try and see.

3309
02:14:14,050 --> 02:14:15,430
Oh, it's a jazz cover!

3310
02:14:15,570 --> 02:14:16,410
Yes, this one.

3311
02:14:16,570 --> 02:14:17,870
I'll link it to you guys.

3312
02:14:18,390 --> 02:14:19,150
This one.

3313
02:14:19,910 --> 02:14:21,390
This is one of my favorite...

3314
02:14:21,390 --> 02:14:22,910
One of my favorite songs.

3315
02:14:23,090 --> 02:14:23,750
It's so good.

3316
02:14:23,750 --> 02:14:25,730
It's a jazz cover of Ashley's song.

3317
02:14:28,690 --> 02:14:29,690
Big street, huh?

3318
02:14:29,910 --> 02:14:31,210
Nice for morning walks though.

3319
02:14:31,470 --> 02:14:32,130
Can confirm.

3320
02:14:34,170 --> 02:14:35,790
There's a lot to do here in downtown.

3321
02:14:36,150 --> 02:14:37,430
Like going to Club Sugar.

3322
02:14:37,730 --> 02:14:39,730
I can't wait to see what kind of moves...

3323
02:14:39,730 --> 02:14:41,610
Jimmy T has cooked up for us tonight.

3324
02:14:44,450 --> 02:14:45,710
That's a good song.

3325
02:14:46,330 --> 02:14:47,250
Ba-dum-bum-bum.

3326
02:14:47,490 --> 02:14:48,350
Ba-dum-bum-bum.

3327
02:14:48,590 --> 02:14:49,430
Ba-dum-bum-bum.

3328
02:14:52,450 --> 02:14:53,150
Hey there.

3329
02:14:53,150 --> 02:14:54,510
Have you seen Jimmy T anywhere?

3330
02:14:54,950 --> 02:14:57,290
He's usually over here at Club Sugar right about now.

3331
02:14:57,590 --> 02:14:59,070
Laving up the dance floor.

3332
02:14:59,450 --> 02:15:00,910
I can't seem to find him today.

3333
02:15:01,370 --> 02:15:02,750
I'm so lost.

3334
02:15:03,210 --> 02:15:04,570
Who made this city?

3335
02:15:05,110 --> 02:15:06,270
Oh my God.

3336
02:15:06,310 --> 02:15:07,210
There's more?

3337
02:15:08,110 --> 02:15:08,710
Alright.

3338
02:15:09,090 --> 02:15:10,350
I'll figure this out.

3339
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:14,770
My son won't look...

3340
02:15:14,770 --> 02:15:16,170
My son won't...

3341
02:15:16,170 --> 02:15:17,870
Look at me in the eye anymore.

3342
02:15:18,250 --> 02:15:20,630
I'm starting to drill into the gravel for oil.

3343
02:15:20,630 --> 02:15:23,410
It's not like the dinosaurs were using it or anything.

3344
02:15:23,790 --> 02:15:25,690
Sorry, I forgot it was a toad.

3345
02:15:27,450 --> 02:15:29,990
He used to be watching a documentary on dinosaurs.

3346
02:15:31,310 --> 02:15:31,970
Oh wait.

3347
02:15:32,030 --> 02:15:33,930
That was just him doing something.

3348
02:15:34,810 --> 02:15:38,070
I can't wait for my brilliant Larry Influencer to move in.

3349
02:15:38,290 --> 02:15:41,470
I've been following them since they were at 1.5 million.

3350
02:15:44,290 --> 02:15:45,590
What the fuck?

3351
02:15:46,750 --> 02:15:47,830
One of us.

3352
02:15:47,990 --> 02:15:48,710
One of us!

3353
02:15:49,330 --> 02:15:50,210
One of us!

3354
02:15:51,230 --> 02:15:52,570
Is that all they say?

3355
02:15:53,010 --> 02:15:55,750
Is there any of them that isn't one of...

3356
02:15:55,750 --> 02:15:56,410
Let me go.

3357
02:15:56,630 --> 02:15:57,210
Let me out.

3358
02:15:57,430 --> 02:15:57,890
Let me out.

3359
02:15:58,650 --> 02:15:59,810
One of us!

3360
02:16:00,050 --> 02:16:00,710
Oh my God.

3361
02:16:00,810 --> 02:16:01,270
Let me out.

3362
02:16:01,470 --> 02:16:02,190
Let me out.

3363
02:16:02,410 --> 02:16:03,190
Let me out.

3364
02:16:06,550 --> 02:16:08,050
There's something off about here.

3365
02:16:08,330 --> 02:16:11,530
Like I'm always being watched or about to be part of a Xan game.

3366
02:16:13,790 --> 02:16:17,150
I've seen a shady city change so much over the years.

3367
02:16:17,550 --> 02:16:20,370
It's almost as if it doesn't have a canonical image or location.

3368
02:16:21,650 --> 02:16:23,110
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

3369
02:16:23,270 --> 02:16:23,530
Thank you.

3370
02:16:23,670 --> 02:16:24,150
Thank you.

3371
02:16:24,350 --> 02:16:27,630
Here's something for a package of long Xans.

3372
02:16:27,750 --> 02:16:31,650
Thank you for sacrificing your voice for toad realism.

3373
02:16:32,690 --> 02:16:33,770
Name of the super chat.

3374
02:16:33,930 --> 02:16:34,170
Thank you.

3375
02:16:34,330 --> 02:16:34,650
Thank you.

3376
02:16:34,790 --> 02:16:34,930
Yeah.

3377
02:16:35,130 --> 02:16:36,470
I definitely need it.

3378
02:16:39,230 --> 02:16:43,050
Since the cat challenge started, I've seen some catchers with a totally different color.

3379
02:16:43,370 --> 02:16:46,190
I wonder why that is.

3380
02:16:46,450 --> 02:16:47,730
Oh, they're talking about shinies.

3381
02:16:50,150 --> 02:16:50,590
Alright.

3382
02:16:51,030 --> 02:16:51,770
Where am I?

3383
02:16:52,810 --> 02:16:54,290
God, I'm so lost.

3384
02:16:54,690 --> 02:16:57,130
I'm so fucking lost in the city.

3385
02:16:57,790 --> 02:16:58,550
There's so much to do!

3386
02:16:58,610 --> 02:16:59,750
I don't know where to go first!

3387
02:17:00,270 --> 02:17:00,810
Yeah, it's me.

3388
02:17:00,950 --> 02:17:01,250
Oh!

3389
02:17:04,810 --> 02:17:05,730
Oh, no!

3390
02:17:05,930 --> 02:17:06,230
Get me!

3391
02:17:07,910 --> 02:17:08,530
Yay!

3392
02:17:11,410 --> 02:17:12,990
My toe, my Yoshi!

3393
02:17:15,230 --> 02:17:15,810
Yoshi!

3394
02:17:19,310 --> 02:17:20,990
That's beautiful soft sand.

3395
02:17:21,290 --> 02:17:22,990
Take your shoes off and relish in it.

3396
02:17:23,490 --> 02:17:23,850
Nice.

3397
02:17:23,890 --> 02:17:24,970
I got float stone.

3398
02:17:26,490 --> 02:17:26,910
Yay!

3399
02:17:29,430 --> 02:17:31,350
Hey Mario, it's me photo.

3400
02:17:31,650 --> 02:17:32,610
Yeah, take a photo.

3401
02:17:34,190 --> 02:17:34,590
Yeah!

3402
02:17:35,570 --> 02:17:37,110
Alright, you guys can see my photo.

3403
02:17:38,890 --> 02:17:39,810
Hold it on date.

3404
02:17:40,810 --> 02:17:44,330
The longer you live here, the more you see how weird and eccentric everyone is.

3405
02:17:45,910 --> 02:17:49,850
Wario isn't the mayor of Diamond City, but I love to act like he is.

3406
02:17:50,970 --> 02:17:52,130
Anything over here?

3407
02:17:52,350 --> 02:17:52,730
No.

3408
02:17:54,390 --> 02:17:54,790
Okay.

3409
02:17:55,210 --> 02:17:56,090
Where have I been?

3410
02:17:56,430 --> 02:17:58,030
I can't tell anymore.

3411
02:17:58,930 --> 02:18:00,850
Everything looks the same.

3412
02:18:04,230 --> 02:18:05,950
You know about Poyoro?

3413
02:18:06,410 --> 02:18:09,230
I heard they're making a monster tamer game based off of it.

3414
02:18:09,830 --> 02:18:10,430
Poyoro?

3415
02:18:11,670 --> 02:18:12,290
What's that?

3416
02:18:12,490 --> 02:18:14,730
Is that supposed to be, like, Pokemon?

3417
02:18:16,690 --> 02:18:18,710
My husband loves to pick things off the street.

3418
02:18:19,090 --> 02:18:21,790
I think it's a little gross, but it makes him happy.

3419
02:18:22,970 --> 02:18:23,370
Hey!

3420
02:18:23,570 --> 02:18:26,710
My voice says I can't keep up my fighting, so you can have this.

3421
02:18:28,050 --> 02:18:28,450
Nice.

3422
02:18:28,450 --> 02:18:29,430
I got a tiny mushroom.

3423
02:18:29,870 --> 02:18:30,870
I mean, you could eat it.

3424
02:18:31,810 --> 02:18:33,270
You don't have to, like...

3425
02:18:33,270 --> 02:18:34,970
You don't have to, like, give it away.

3426
02:18:34,970 --> 02:18:36,210
You could eat the mushroom.

3427
02:18:36,610 --> 02:18:37,370
It's-a me!

3428
02:18:37,550 --> 02:18:37,990
A Mario!

3429
02:18:38,850 --> 02:18:39,870
That's not the voice.

3430
02:18:42,890 --> 02:18:44,050
I should really stop.

3431
02:18:45,370 --> 02:18:48,290
Sorry, but Diamond Academy seems to be well-pired currently.

3432
02:18:48,750 --> 02:18:51,170
As such, the doors are stuck- stuck locked.

3433
02:18:51,710 --> 02:18:52,570
I need to stop.

3434
02:18:57,550 --> 02:18:59,850
There's too many toads!

3435
02:19:02,770 --> 02:19:04,370
You hear giggling inside.

3436
02:19:04,610 --> 02:19:06,070
The fuck is going on in that house?

3437
02:19:06,770 --> 02:19:08,170
Okay, I talked to her already.

3438
02:19:08,170 --> 02:19:10,370
Okay, at least I know who I've talked to before.

3439
02:19:11,690 --> 02:19:12,210
Alright.

3440
02:19:13,570 --> 02:19:14,950
I talked to him already.

3441
02:19:15,470 --> 02:19:16,350
This is new.

3442
02:19:19,570 --> 02:19:21,130
Okay, I'm not doing that.

3443
02:19:22,190 --> 02:19:24,430
Oh, they're all doing Mario Kart stuff.

3444
02:19:26,370 --> 02:19:27,230
Vroom vroom!

3445
02:19:28,610 --> 02:19:30,430
Alright, let's see.

3446
02:19:32,570 --> 02:19:33,610
I've been here?

3447
02:19:34,970 --> 02:19:36,090
Oh, what the fuck?

3448
02:19:36,090 --> 02:19:36,730
Who are you?

3449
02:19:37,630 --> 02:19:38,870
Wait, you're a human.

3450
02:19:39,690 --> 02:19:40,810
Hello, I'm Larry.

3451
02:19:41,190 --> 02:19:42,830
I run a law office here in Diamond City.

3452
02:19:43,150 --> 02:19:46,410
I concentrate in business law for the people of the Mushroom Kingdom.

3453
02:19:46,410 --> 02:19:47,350
What the fuck?

3454
02:19:48,250 --> 02:19:48,850
Who's Larry?

3455
02:19:50,070 --> 02:19:50,830
Larry?

3456
02:19:51,430 --> 02:19:52,530
Who's Larry?

3457
02:19:52,970 --> 02:19:53,530
Larry!

3458
02:19:54,650 --> 02:19:56,270
Larry, my goat!

3459
02:19:59,310 --> 02:20:01,330
What is Larry doing here?

3460
02:20:02,510 --> 02:20:03,270
Larry?

3461
02:20:03,750 --> 02:20:05,330
I was going to say it!

3462
02:20:07,090 --> 02:20:09,850
Why is this a human in my mind?

3463
02:20:10,430 --> 02:20:11,750
Larry from Pokemon?

3464
02:20:11,750 --> 02:20:13,670
It's just Larry?

3465
02:20:17,930 --> 02:20:20,190
How many jobs does he have?

3466
02:20:20,430 --> 02:20:22,190
What is Larry doing here?

3467
02:20:23,090 --> 02:20:25,450
Larry, go back to your game!

3468
02:20:27,910 --> 02:20:31,550
I wonder what Dr. Kragor does all the way on his little island.

3469
02:20:33,110 --> 02:20:35,450
What do you mean, it's just Larry?

3470
02:20:35,910 --> 02:20:37,470
It's the Larry!

3471
02:20:38,510 --> 02:20:40,850
Yeah, but what is he doing here?

3472
02:20:45,690 --> 02:20:48,230
This new game idea was brilliant!

3473
02:20:49,430 --> 02:20:55,270
Soon, I'll have everyone play my game instead of a stupid Pyromon.

3474
02:20:57,730 --> 02:21:00,770
I don't need a catchy name for it.

3475
02:21:01,130 --> 02:21:03,270
Something like Pyromon.

3476
02:21:04,010 --> 02:21:05,430
I got it!

3477
02:21:05,790 --> 02:21:06,870
Wario-mon!

3478
02:21:09,030 --> 02:21:12,870
Now all I need is the color of some chumps to make the game for me.

3479
02:21:15,570 --> 02:21:16,730
Oh my god!

3480
02:21:17,350 --> 02:21:18,690
It's the Wario characters!

3481
02:21:20,090 --> 02:21:22,610
Jimmy, how about you work on another game for me?

3482
02:21:23,370 --> 02:21:23,930
Groovy?

3483
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:32,340
Penny, gadget's a gizmo!

3484
02:21:33,320 --> 02:21:35,480
Of course, Mr. Wario!

3485
02:21:38,320 --> 02:21:39,420
It's Ashley!

3486
02:21:41,380 --> 02:21:43,200
Ashley, I need you too!

3487
02:21:45,360 --> 02:21:46,700
She'll come through.

3488
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:48,420
Wah-ha-ha!

3489
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:52,240
Oh.

3490
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:55,800
Three key passwords.

3491
02:21:57,400 --> 02:21:59,680
I want a password.

3492
02:21:59,960 --> 02:22:01,040
This city is so big.

3493
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:03,260
Hello there, little man.

3494
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:05,580
Would you like to become my minion?

3495
02:22:05,940 --> 02:22:08,460
Well, what if I frame you with my freeze ray?

3496
02:22:09,180 --> 02:22:12,340
Oh, the doctor forgot to refuel my freeze ray.

3497
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:14,440
This is what I need minions for.

3498
02:22:14,840 --> 02:22:15,600
Little man.

3499
02:22:15,900 --> 02:22:18,440
I do not have, how you say, caps.

3500
02:22:18,780 --> 02:22:20,840
For me to recruit my own minions.

3501
02:22:24,180 --> 02:22:25,880
But having one will be enough.

3502
02:22:27,360 --> 02:22:28,780
Can you come back with a minion?

3503
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:32,140
I'll trade you a capture that has been too useful for me.

3504
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:33,080
Oh!

3505
02:22:33,620 --> 02:22:34,340
I do.

3506
02:22:37,420 --> 02:22:38,160
I do.

3507
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:38,700
I do have one.

3508
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:39,340
Don't worry.

3509
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:41,920
Alright, who did I...

3510
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:42,640
Who was it?

3511
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:44,660
Goodbye, Red.

3512
02:22:48,700 --> 02:22:49,600
Don't worry.

3513
02:22:49,740 --> 02:22:50,760
I'll rename you.

3514
02:22:51,520 --> 02:22:52,460
Don't worry.

3515
02:22:52,840 --> 02:22:55,480
I'll have the alternate universe of you.

3516
02:22:56,240 --> 02:22:56,660
Yeah.

3517
02:22:57,440 --> 02:22:58,300
Goodbye, Red.

3518
02:23:01,140 --> 02:23:01,800
7.

3519
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:02,620
Goodbye.

3520
02:23:03,860 --> 02:23:06,020
Bye-bye, Red Goon.

3521
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:08,920
Oh, that's cool.

3522
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:09,680
That's funny.

3523
02:23:13,140 --> 02:23:15,360
He gave me a go-ba!

3524
02:23:21,370 --> 02:23:21,830
Alright.

3525
02:23:22,250 --> 02:23:25,130
Red, I would say this is like an upgrade, Red.

3526
02:23:25,490 --> 02:23:25,810
I...

3527
02:23:25,810 --> 02:23:26,250
You know?

3528
02:23:26,510 --> 02:23:27,230
You know, Red?

3529
02:23:27,470 --> 02:23:29,150
This is sort of an upgrade.

3530
02:23:29,510 --> 02:23:31,230
You get to be naked and free.

3531
02:23:32,090 --> 02:23:32,850
Little man.

3532
02:23:32,970 --> 02:23:34,050
You're proving your worth to me.

3533
02:23:34,210 --> 02:23:35,510
So we'll no longer call you.

3534
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:36,950
But man in red and blue.

3535
02:23:36,950 --> 02:23:38,690
We will meet again.

3536
02:23:40,150 --> 02:23:40,770
Minion.

3537
02:23:41,030 --> 02:23:43,090
I have big plans for us.

3538
02:23:43,990 --> 02:23:44,330
Oh my god.

3539
02:23:44,610 --> 02:23:45,090
Goodbye, Red.

3540
02:23:50,610 --> 02:23:51,570
It's okay.

3541
02:23:51,930 --> 02:23:53,230
Oh, I can't rename you.

3542
02:23:53,470 --> 02:23:53,610
Oh.

3543
02:23:54,050 --> 02:23:54,310
Alright.

3544
02:23:55,210 --> 02:23:57,110
Goodbye, Red Goon.

3545
02:23:59,030 --> 02:24:02,130
I hope you live a beautiful life.

3546
02:24:02,650 --> 02:24:05,090
With this random stranger.

3547
02:24:05,510 --> 02:24:15,320
I hope you have a great life.

3548
02:24:15,730 --> 02:24:17,390
With this random man.

3549
02:24:21,530 --> 02:24:22,390
Goodbye.

3550
02:24:27,210 --> 02:24:30,030
I forgot you can't rename.

3551
02:24:30,550 --> 02:24:42,310
That goes right here.

3552
02:24:42,630 --> 02:24:44,370
And that goes over there.

3553
02:24:44,630 --> 02:24:45,270
Fixed.

3554
02:24:45,410 --> 02:24:46,730
Well done, Penny.

3555
02:24:47,030 --> 02:24:49,430
You got this rental facility all up and ready.

3556
02:24:49,430 --> 02:24:55,930
Well, I should be getting back to my lab to finish my who's-and-whats-and-a-nator.

3557
02:24:56,430 --> 02:24:57,230
Good luck.

3558
02:25:00,250 --> 02:25:00,930
Mario!

3559
02:25:01,870 --> 02:25:05,070
Here, how it takes to beat the rental facility?

3560
02:25:05,350 --> 02:25:10,350
Beat three of my robo-commanders with your holocaps to face me.

3561
02:25:11,650 --> 02:25:12,630
It's okay.

3562
02:25:13,070 --> 02:25:13,850
It's okay.

3563
02:25:13,990 --> 02:25:17,850
Red's having a good life right now.

3564
02:25:22,370 --> 02:25:23,210
What's this?

3565
02:25:24,690 --> 02:25:26,030
We're late for class.

3566
02:25:26,670 --> 02:25:28,410
I'll miss the box.

3567
02:25:28,990 --> 02:25:31,150
Red, thank you for the super chat.

3568
02:25:31,630 --> 02:25:31,970
Thank you.

3569
02:25:31,970 --> 02:25:33,770
You get to be a minion, Red.

3570
02:25:34,130 --> 02:25:35,010
You get to work.

3571
02:25:37,770 --> 02:25:39,350
That's not too bad.

3572
02:25:39,890 --> 02:25:41,670
But head up to teacher's lounge right away.

3573
02:25:41,870 --> 02:25:43,650
Don't want to get in more trouble.

3574
02:25:45,650 --> 02:25:47,310
I'm a guy to the battle swap tournament.

3575
02:25:47,450 --> 02:25:49,770
Would you like me to take you to the chair?

3576
02:25:50,650 --> 02:25:51,250
We're being challenged.

3577
02:25:51,450 --> 02:25:52,270
I need to save data.

3578
02:25:52,450 --> 02:25:52,750
All right.

3579
02:25:58,780 --> 02:25:59,340
All right.

3580
02:25:59,500 --> 02:25:59,980
Here we go.

3581
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:02,820
Yeah, and he has a freeze ray.

3582
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:04,280
Isn't that cool?

3583
02:26:07,820 --> 02:26:10,160
Oh, I have to use... Oh, it's battle.

3584
02:26:10,380 --> 02:26:10,620
Okay.

3585
02:26:11,400 --> 02:26:12,740
Chubby dino capture.

3586
02:26:13,380 --> 02:26:14,260
Oh, my God.

3587
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:15,920
We always want a baby Yoshi.

3588
02:26:16,440 --> 02:26:17,580
Yeah, I want you.

3589
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:23,720
Duplicus?

3590
02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:24,660
Oh, wait.

3591
02:26:24,660 --> 02:26:25,520
They're so cute.

3592
02:26:26,660 --> 02:26:28,600
Wait, I want Duplicus.

3593
02:26:28,640 --> 02:26:29,180
He's cute.

3594
02:26:30,720 --> 02:26:32,640
Oh, he transforms into them.

3595
02:26:32,800 --> 02:26:33,200
And then look.

3596
02:26:33,340 --> 02:26:33,380
See?

3597
02:26:33,480 --> 02:26:33,560
Look.

3598
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:34,440
There you are!

3599
02:26:35,140 --> 02:26:36,180
There you are!

3600
02:26:36,360 --> 02:26:36,580
Look.

3601
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:36,820
See?

3602
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:40,380
Oh, in honor of you, I'll use another minion.

3603
02:26:40,420 --> 02:26:41,520
I'll use a minion.

3604
02:26:45,670 --> 02:26:47,510
Mr. Judge, you have our trust.

3605
02:26:47,770 --> 02:26:48,330
Oh, my God.

3606
02:26:48,410 --> 02:26:49,390
It's a regular person.

3607
02:26:52,010 --> 02:26:52,490
Swimmer.

3608
02:26:53,170 --> 02:26:53,930
Wait, why?

3609
02:26:54,170 --> 02:26:56,110
Why is, like, regular trainers here?

3610
02:26:58,790 --> 02:26:59,390
All right.

3611
02:26:59,670 --> 02:26:59,890
Oh.

3612
02:27:00,530 --> 02:27:01,950
Oh, this is all your moves?

3613
02:27:02,110 --> 02:27:03,610
Oh, I should have looked at your moves.

3614
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:05,910
I should have...

3615
02:27:05,910 --> 02:27:09,690
I should have looked at his moves before I did anything.

3616
02:27:10,210 --> 02:27:10,650
I...

3617
02:27:14,610 --> 02:27:15,170
Oops.

3618
02:27:17,590 --> 02:27:18,270
All right.

3619
02:27:18,450 --> 02:27:18,870
It's time.

3620
02:27:19,150 --> 02:27:20,490
It's time, baby Yoshi.

3621
02:27:22,290 --> 02:27:23,810
One more stockpile.

3622
02:27:26,990 --> 02:27:27,730
All right.

3623
02:27:27,850 --> 02:27:28,790
How much can I do?

3624
02:27:29,070 --> 02:27:29,870
I forgot.

3625
02:27:32,170 --> 02:27:32,950
All right.

3626
02:27:33,310 --> 02:27:34,230
And then we...

3627
02:27:34,230 --> 02:27:35,530
We spit it out.

3628
02:27:39,700 --> 02:27:40,440
All right.

3629
02:27:40,820 --> 02:27:41,860
Spit it out!

3630
02:27:43,700 --> 02:27:44,020
Okay.

3631
02:27:44,020 --> 02:27:45,100
It's not very effective.

3632
02:27:45,380 --> 02:27:45,540
Okay.

3633
02:27:45,620 --> 02:27:46,220
That's awkward.

3634
02:27:46,760 --> 02:27:47,220
That's...

3635
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:50,840
That's pretty awkward.

3636
02:27:51,060 --> 02:27:51,300
All right.

3637
02:27:51,380 --> 02:27:52,360
Let's swap you out.

3638
02:27:52,600 --> 02:27:53,460
I think...

3639
02:27:53,460 --> 02:27:57,420
Guys, I realized maybe I should have read their moveset before I picked them up.

3640
02:27:57,420 --> 02:28:00,040
I just saw baby Yoshi, and I was like, I need...

3641
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:01,260
I need to use it.

3642
02:28:03,260 --> 02:28:04,060
Whoops.

3643
02:28:05,820 --> 02:28:06,260
All right.

3644
02:28:06,340 --> 02:28:06,880
Electrify.

3645
02:28:10,100 --> 02:28:10,660
All right.

3646
02:28:11,180 --> 02:28:12,020
Come on, red.

3647
02:28:13,460 --> 02:28:14,600
You got this.

3648
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:16,540
You're basically red.

3649
02:28:21,650 --> 02:28:22,170
All right.

3650
02:28:22,290 --> 02:28:22,510
Nice.

3651
02:28:23,150 --> 02:28:23,430
Yeah!

3652
02:28:27,490 --> 02:28:28,290
Spine.

3653
02:28:28,690 --> 02:28:29,290
He was...

3654
02:28:30,450 --> 02:28:31,050
Okay.

3655
02:28:31,130 --> 02:28:31,690
Let's use dive.

3656
02:28:33,450 --> 02:28:34,230
That's right.

3657
02:28:34,370 --> 02:28:34,970
I'm a coward.

3658
02:28:35,130 --> 02:28:35,770
I hide underwater.

3659
02:28:39,690 --> 02:28:41,770
I miss my mons, guys.

3660
02:28:42,250 --> 02:28:42,870
I hate you.

3661
02:28:42,990 --> 02:28:43,530
Wait, what?

3662
02:28:44,930 --> 02:28:45,770
That did nothing?

3663
02:28:47,190 --> 02:28:47,790
What?

3664
02:28:48,810 --> 02:28:49,510
Oh, yeah?

3665
02:28:50,070 --> 02:28:52,150
Can't do that if I hide underwater.

3666
02:28:53,470 --> 02:28:54,470
Can't do that.

3667
02:28:55,030 --> 02:28:55,890
That's right.

3668
02:28:57,270 --> 02:28:58,950
I uno reversed him.

3669
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:04,360
Wait, is this Stia?

3670
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:07,240
Okay, I'll sidewave it.

3671
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:09,540
Surely, this is stronger, right?

3672
02:29:10,900 --> 02:29:12,020
Oh, it is.

3673
02:29:12,180 --> 02:29:12,360
Nice.

3674
02:29:12,660 --> 02:29:13,960
Okay, that was a lot stronger than that.

3675
02:29:14,020 --> 02:29:15,060
You would think that...

3676
02:29:15,060 --> 02:29:19,480
A move that requires two turns was stronger, but apparently not.

3677
02:29:22,660 --> 02:29:23,700
I'm gaming.

3678
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:26,480
Sprangler.

3679
02:29:26,780 --> 02:29:27,200
Okay.

3680
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:28,860
I'll just sidewave it.

3681
02:29:29,720 --> 02:29:30,920
Bugs are bad with psychic.

3682
02:29:32,680 --> 02:29:33,940
That's one thing I...

3683
02:29:33,940 --> 02:29:34,600
Okay, apparently.

3684
02:29:34,920 --> 02:29:35,320
Never mind.

3685
02:29:35,540 --> 02:29:36,540
They're just normal to it.

3686
02:29:37,820 --> 02:29:39,260
I don't understand.

3687
02:29:39,820 --> 02:29:42,680
I don't know anything about type advantages.

3688
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:43,660
I don't know.

3689
02:29:47,460 --> 02:29:49,360
I'm like, apparently not.

3690
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:55,840
Oh, it's the other way around.

3691
02:29:56,340 --> 02:29:56,900
Oh.

3692
02:29:57,880 --> 02:29:58,440
Whoops.

3693
02:30:00,500 --> 02:30:02,000
I was thinking of a poison.

3694
02:30:02,280 --> 02:30:02,480
Yeah.

3695
02:30:04,240 --> 02:30:04,980
It's okay.

3696
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:05,460
It works.

3697
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:07,500
Spamming one move always works, guys.

3698
02:30:09,580 --> 02:30:10,520
Thank you for competing.

3699
02:30:10,700 --> 02:30:11,840
Let us restore your captures.

3700
02:30:12,620 --> 02:30:14,140
Hey, can I, like, swap?

3701
02:30:16,740 --> 02:30:17,980
What is rest?

3702
02:30:17,980 --> 02:30:20,420
Oh, I guess I have to go on.

3703
02:30:20,920 --> 02:30:21,540
Yes.

3704
02:30:22,020 --> 02:30:24,660
Yeah, I realized baby Yoshi was not it.

3705
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:25,680
Baby.

3706
02:30:26,320 --> 02:30:28,100
It's time to swap you.

3707
02:30:29,820 --> 02:30:31,900
Little spark spiny.

3708
02:30:32,460 --> 02:30:33,980
Okay, let's...

3709
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:37,250
Oh, I can steal their...

3710
02:30:37,660 --> 02:30:38,740
Their mons.

3711
02:30:41,260 --> 02:30:43,420
You know, I'll steal your baby, son.

3712
02:30:45,180 --> 02:30:46,960
A baby for a baby.

3713
02:30:50,780 --> 02:30:51,420
Toys.

3714
02:30:51,580 --> 02:30:52,560
I need more toys.

3715
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:54,040
It's so weird.

3716
02:30:54,180 --> 02:30:55,480
I'm battling, like, people.

3717
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,220
Photographer Avery.

3718
02:31:02,440 --> 02:31:03,080
Alright.

3719
02:31:04,780 --> 02:31:05,420
Spark.

3720
02:31:05,820 --> 02:31:06,420
Weather ball.

3721
02:31:07,500 --> 02:31:08,160
I just spark.

3722
02:31:08,460 --> 02:31:10,380
I think spark was an attack move, right?

3723
02:31:11,140 --> 02:31:11,780
Yeah.

3724
02:31:12,260 --> 02:31:12,480
Yay!

3725
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:15,580
Man vs.

3726
02:31:15,940 --> 02:31:16,460
Mario.

3727
02:31:18,260 --> 02:31:19,380
What the fuck?

3728
02:31:19,900 --> 02:31:20,680
A pair of bitty?

3729
02:31:21,560 --> 02:31:22,960
Oh, they're in Super Mario.

3730
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:24,400
Uh, Sunshine.

3731
02:31:24,680 --> 02:31:25,840
Uh, 64, right?

3732
02:31:26,060 --> 02:31:27,080
These guys were in 64.

3733
02:31:29,740 --> 02:31:30,500
Oh, no.

3734
02:31:30,980 --> 02:31:31,860
Wait, that's not fair.

3735
02:31:31,880 --> 02:31:32,880
This is 1v3.

3736
02:31:37,030 --> 02:31:38,070
This is a one...

3737
02:31:38,070 --> 02:31:38,850
I'm a baby!

3738
02:31:39,850 --> 02:31:41,570
Oh, Mario 3D web?

3739
02:31:41,970 --> 02:31:42,470
Oh.

3740
02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:51,660
I was, like, 10 years short of my guess.

3741
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:53,040
Maybe 15 plus.

3742
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:54,920
Wait, that's a person!

3743
02:31:57,640 --> 02:32:00,600
What is a Lakitu doing in my...

3744
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:02,140
In my mind game?

3745
02:32:03,740 --> 02:32:05,960
What is an actual cap...

3746
02:32:05,960 --> 02:32:06,120
What?

3747
02:32:06,380 --> 02:32:06,760
He's...

3748
02:32:06,760 --> 02:32:07,800
He has rights!

3749
02:32:11,180 --> 02:32:12,780
Doesn't he have rights?

3750
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:17,220
Doesn't he have rights?

3751
02:32:17,220 --> 02:32:17,660
All right.

3752
02:32:22,410 --> 02:32:23,810
Yeah, but I've talked to him!

3753
02:32:25,030 --> 02:32:26,490
He can't say that.

3754
02:32:28,410 --> 02:32:29,970
Not around here.

3755
02:32:30,150 --> 02:32:31,330
Not anymore.

3756
02:32:31,990 --> 02:32:34,430
I need to work for money.

3757
02:32:34,710 --> 02:32:35,310
What...

3758
02:32:35,310 --> 02:32:37,090
What are these quotes?

3759
02:32:42,060 --> 02:32:42,660
No.

3760
02:32:43,420 --> 02:32:44,400
I don't need a swap.

3761
02:32:44,780 --> 02:32:45,760
I'm satisfied.

3762
02:32:47,420 --> 02:32:48,140
Oh my god!

3763
02:32:48,520 --> 02:32:49,280
Big news!

3764
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:50,460
It's a sand tomb!

3765
02:32:50,700 --> 02:32:51,540
Oh my god, it's a...

3766
02:32:51,540 --> 02:32:52,700
It's actually a...

3767
02:32:52,700 --> 02:32:54,360
An actual person from Mario.

3768
02:32:54,520 --> 02:32:55,700
Wait, what the fuck?

3769
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:56,080
What?

3770
02:32:58,520 --> 02:33:01,040
And it swaps to like...

3771
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:01,380
A man.

3772
02:33:01,740 --> 02:33:02,060
I was like...

3773
02:33:02,060 --> 02:33:03,100
Oh look, there's Toad!

3774
02:33:03,520 --> 02:33:05,600
And a man is here now.

3775
02:33:05,780 --> 02:33:07,100
Wait, what are my other moves?

3776
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:07,940
I don't know.

3777
02:33:10,820 --> 02:33:11,980
Okay, electrifying.

3778
02:33:12,300 --> 02:33:13,060
Okay, weather bot.

3779
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:15,420
Change with the weather.

3780
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:16,040
Okay.

3781
02:33:17,100 --> 02:33:17,680
Well...

3782
02:33:17,680 --> 02:33:18,440
I don't know.

3783
02:33:18,800 --> 02:33:19,660
Maybe I should...

3784
02:33:19,660 --> 02:33:20,660
I should change the minion.

3785
02:33:20,840 --> 02:33:21,360
Because...

3786
02:33:21,360 --> 02:33:23,080
This should work against them, right?

3787
02:33:26,140 --> 02:33:26,880
Okay.

3788
02:33:28,290 --> 02:33:29,900
So it never failed me.

3789
02:33:32,820 --> 02:33:33,560
Go!

3790
02:33:36,120 --> 02:33:37,560
Okay, it failed me.

3791
02:33:40,900 --> 02:33:41,640
Okay.

3792
02:33:42,220 --> 02:33:42,920
Never mind.

3793
02:33:44,660 --> 02:33:46,000
Until now.

3794
02:33:46,700 --> 02:33:47,880
It failed me.

3795
02:33:53,280 --> 02:33:54,160
It's okay.

3796
02:33:54,320 --> 02:33:55,100
I can do this.

3797
02:33:59,530 --> 02:34:00,010
Um...

3798
02:34:00,010 --> 02:34:01,010
Now I don't know.

3799
02:34:01,330 --> 02:34:02,230
Now I...

3800
02:34:04,550 --> 02:34:05,210
I'll just...

3801
02:34:05,210 --> 02:34:05,350
I'll just...

3802
02:34:05,350 --> 02:34:06,610
I'll keep using Sidewave.

3803
02:34:09,310 --> 02:34:10,390
Is Dive better?

3804
02:34:10,750 --> 02:34:11,410
I don't know.

3805
02:34:11,590 --> 02:34:13,210
It feels like Dive has been like...

3806
02:34:13,210 --> 02:34:14,090
Fucking me up lately.

3807
02:34:14,870 --> 02:34:17,130
Took two turns to do absolutely nothing.

3808
02:34:18,310 --> 02:34:18,950
Oh wait.

3809
02:34:19,150 --> 02:34:19,570
That's fine.

3810
02:34:20,210 --> 02:34:21,530
My guy's stupid as well.

3811
02:34:21,910 --> 02:34:23,910
He's just been trying to use Sandstorm.

3812
02:34:33,480 --> 02:34:33,960
Okay.

3813
02:34:34,140 --> 02:34:34,240
Yeah.

3814
02:34:34,340 --> 02:34:35,020
It's not worth it.

3815
02:34:35,020 --> 02:34:36,100
I don't think it is.

3816
02:34:36,460 --> 02:34:37,300
That's right.

3817
02:34:37,580 --> 02:34:39,220
I can eat Sad.

3818
02:34:39,740 --> 02:34:40,500
Yum yum yum.

3819
02:34:42,200 --> 02:34:44,360
You trying to use Sad on me?

3820
02:34:44,580 --> 02:34:45,860
It fuels me.

3821
02:34:46,180 --> 02:34:47,460
Yum yum yum yum yum.

3822
02:34:47,880 --> 02:34:48,880
Oh, it's a rat.

3823
02:34:50,060 --> 02:34:51,440
Oh, I stole it?

3824
02:34:51,580 --> 02:34:51,960
Oh my god.

3825
02:34:52,020 --> 02:34:52,900
I stole his berry.

3826
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:55,720
Sad.

3827
02:34:56,100 --> 02:34:56,320
Yummy.

3828
02:34:57,960 --> 02:34:59,380
Yum yum yum yum.

3829
02:35:01,040 --> 02:35:02,940
Sidewave has never failed me.

3830
02:35:07,970 --> 02:35:08,990
Oh my god.

3831
02:35:09,070 --> 02:35:10,050
I hate alpha red.

3832
02:35:10,270 --> 02:35:10,610
Of course.

3833
02:35:10,950 --> 02:35:12,210
It's been fun so far.

3834
02:35:12,410 --> 02:35:14,050
Thanks for making such a cool mod.

3835
02:35:15,050 --> 02:35:16,490
I'm having so much fun.

3836
02:35:17,430 --> 02:35:17,730
Alright.

3837
02:35:18,650 --> 02:35:19,070
It's okay.

3838
02:35:19,190 --> 02:35:20,090
What's he gonna do?

3839
02:35:20,330 --> 02:35:22,310
Steal my berry that I stole?

3840
02:35:23,710 --> 02:35:24,230
Thief.

3841
02:35:25,930 --> 02:35:26,450
Alright.

3842
02:35:26,730 --> 02:35:26,950
Nice.

3843
02:35:27,250 --> 02:35:27,770
I did it.

3844
02:35:28,290 --> 02:35:29,010
Told you guys.

3845
02:35:29,190 --> 02:35:30,870
Sidewave has never failed me.

3846
02:35:31,910 --> 02:35:32,110
Wait.

3847
02:35:32,470 --> 02:35:32,990
It says...

3848
02:35:32,990 --> 02:35:33,210
Wait.

3849
02:35:33,270 --> 02:35:33,350
No.

3850
02:35:33,450 --> 02:35:34,090
I killed two.

3851
02:35:34,250 --> 02:35:35,070
I've lost count.

3852
02:35:36,730 --> 02:35:37,670
This is it.

3853
02:35:37,870 --> 02:35:39,390
This is what we've been waiting for.

3854
02:35:40,730 --> 02:35:41,510
Oh wait.

3855
02:35:41,550 --> 02:35:42,270
It does nothing.

3856
02:35:42,430 --> 02:35:42,550
Okay.

3857
02:35:42,650 --> 02:35:43,030
Never mind.

3858
02:35:43,250 --> 02:35:45,150
I still don't know my type advantages.

3859
02:35:46,010 --> 02:35:46,850
I still...

3860
02:35:46,850 --> 02:35:47,850
I thought...

3861
02:35:47,850 --> 02:35:48,330
Guys.

3862
02:35:48,530 --> 02:35:49,010
I lost.

3863
02:35:49,270 --> 02:35:51,150
What is Sidewave good against?

3864
02:35:51,410 --> 02:35:51,710
Guys.

3865
02:35:52,230 --> 02:35:52,410
Wait.

3866
02:35:55,230 --> 02:35:57,070
Is it not poison?

3867
02:35:57,070 --> 02:35:59,330
I guess I'll never know.

3868
02:36:03,650 --> 02:36:05,030
Apparently nothing.

3869
02:36:06,390 --> 02:36:06,810
Oh.

3870
02:36:07,110 --> 02:36:08,490
It's a fixed damage.

3871
02:36:09,110 --> 02:36:09,350
No.

3872
02:36:11,550 --> 02:36:12,530
It's okay.

3873
02:36:13,130 --> 02:36:13,690
Okay.

3874
02:36:13,950 --> 02:36:14,690
Minion's dead.

3875
02:36:16,690 --> 02:36:19,750
One of life's greatest mysteries.

3876
02:36:20,210 --> 02:36:20,730
It's okay.

3877
02:36:20,730 --> 02:36:22,110
I'll send a baby out.

3878
02:36:22,850 --> 02:36:25,990
I'll send a baby out to fight a man's game.

3879
02:36:25,990 --> 02:36:27,090
All right.

3880
02:36:27,230 --> 02:36:27,930
Go use Spark.

3881
02:36:30,650 --> 02:36:31,530
All right.

3882
02:36:32,210 --> 02:36:32,810
It's all right.

3883
02:36:33,330 --> 02:36:36,710
Surely this one guy's not gonna kill my entire party.

3884
02:36:39,330 --> 02:36:41,110
Go Hydrogen Baby.

3885
02:36:41,650 --> 02:36:42,230
Don't worry.

3886
02:36:42,550 --> 02:36:45,550
My coughing baby shall kill this Hydrogen Bomb.

3887
02:36:46,430 --> 02:36:46,730
Yay.

3888
02:36:48,210 --> 02:36:49,950
I'm lost in the sand.

3889
02:36:50,070 --> 02:36:51,310
My Toad cosplayer.

3890
02:36:52,510 --> 02:36:55,130
Congratulations on your win in a Battle Swap Challenge.

3891
02:36:55,130 --> 02:36:56,950
Please accept this prize.

3892
02:36:57,750 --> 02:36:58,310
Wait a minute.

3893
02:36:58,610 --> 02:37:00,010
There you are, Mario.

3894
02:37:00,730 --> 02:37:03,390
I'm not surprised you're proficient in capture battles.

3895
02:37:03,470 --> 02:37:05,270
But that doesn't matter now.

3896
02:37:05,950 --> 02:37:09,930
What does matter is in testing on my team.

3897
02:37:10,190 --> 02:37:11,130
Yeah, I'm ready.

3898
02:37:12,050 --> 02:37:12,370
Great.

3899
02:37:12,530 --> 02:37:15,230
Because I'm looking forward to learning a lot in this battle.

3900
02:37:15,410 --> 02:37:16,870
Do I get my own team back?

3901
02:37:17,290 --> 02:37:18,850
Or do I still have the baby?

3902
02:37:18,850 --> 02:37:19,330
Oh, yes.

3903
02:37:19,390 --> 02:37:20,370
I got my own team back.

3904
02:37:20,810 --> 02:37:21,470
That's right.

3905
02:37:21,530 --> 02:37:22,310
Oh, my God.

3906
02:37:22,510 --> 02:37:23,630
It's Dr. Mario.

3907
02:37:25,740 --> 02:37:26,480
It's the viruses.

3908
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:29,260
That's where I'm gonna throw you.

3909
02:37:33,180 --> 02:37:33,920
Oh, my God.

3910
02:37:34,020 --> 02:37:35,900
It's the Dr. Mario background music.

3911
02:37:42,040 --> 02:37:44,040
I'm gonna pill you.

3912
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:44,340
Yeah.

3913
02:37:45,080 --> 02:37:45,720
It's time.

3914
02:37:46,100 --> 02:37:47,860
It's time for your vaccine shot.

3915
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:52,320
Yay.

3916
02:37:53,240 --> 02:37:53,780
Go, Dad.

3917
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:54,200
Go.

3918
02:37:55,600 --> 02:37:56,440
Let's go.

3919
02:37:56,880 --> 02:37:58,060
Beat those virus up.

3920
02:37:59,580 --> 02:38:00,300
What did you learn?

3921
02:38:00,400 --> 02:38:01,160
You couldn't cut it.

3922
02:38:01,460 --> 02:38:02,520
You couldn't cut the baby?

3923
02:38:02,520 --> 02:38:03,360
Okay.

3924
02:38:04,020 --> 02:38:05,460
We don't need this trick.

3925
02:38:06,300 --> 02:38:06,400
Okay.

3926
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:06,720
Nice.

3927
02:38:06,840 --> 02:38:07,420
We don't need that.

3928
02:38:07,860 --> 02:38:09,120
It's not a fighting move.

3929
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:10,860
Fighting moves only.

3930
02:38:12,220 --> 02:38:12,700
Alright.

3931
02:38:12,980 --> 02:38:13,760
Learn air cutter.

3932
02:38:14,180 --> 02:38:14,640
Nice.

3933
02:38:19,090 --> 02:38:19,650
Wait.

3934
02:38:20,010 --> 02:38:20,450
Sweet kiss.

3935
02:38:20,670 --> 02:38:21,650
Who wants to learn a kiss?

3936
02:38:22,030 --> 02:38:23,450
Oh, it wasn't baby Yoshi.

3937
02:38:25,330 --> 02:38:28,510
If it was baby Yoshi, I'd put that moveset in.

3938
02:38:29,370 --> 02:38:29,730
Alright.

3939
02:38:31,590 --> 02:38:32,650
We don't trick.

3940
02:38:32,810 --> 02:38:33,390
We brute force.

3941
02:38:33,390 --> 02:38:34,550
Oh, is there the other virus?

3942
02:38:34,830 --> 02:38:35,950
It's time to throw the other one.

3943
02:38:38,950 --> 02:38:39,390
Alright.

3944
02:38:39,910 --> 02:38:40,570
Get in here.

3945
02:38:43,890 --> 02:38:44,330
Okay.

3946
02:38:44,330 --> 02:38:44,570
Wait.

3947
02:38:44,650 --> 02:38:45,490
He's a little strong.

3948
02:38:45,670 --> 02:38:46,110
Wait a minute.

3949
02:38:46,530 --> 02:38:46,890
Wait.

3950
02:38:46,950 --> 02:38:47,490
I'm paralyzed.

3951
02:38:47,950 --> 02:38:48,470
Wait a minute.

3952
02:38:48,770 --> 02:38:49,530
That's okay.

3953
02:38:50,250 --> 02:38:53,030
If one throw doesn't work, I'll use the other throw.

3954
02:38:53,170 --> 02:38:54,270
Oh, he also punched.

3955
02:38:54,370 --> 02:38:54,470
Wait.

3956
02:38:54,530 --> 02:38:55,390
He's also fighting.

3957
02:38:55,670 --> 02:38:55,970
No.

3958
02:38:56,090 --> 02:38:56,910
My 10k.

3959
02:38:59,070 --> 02:38:59,510
No.

3960
02:39:02,310 --> 02:39:05,470
Guys, I can't keep spending money on surgery.

3961
02:39:05,470 --> 02:39:06,890
I can't keep.

3962
02:39:07,950 --> 02:39:08,430
Alright.

3963
02:39:08,650 --> 02:39:08,830
Nice.

3964
02:39:11,570 --> 02:39:12,510
It's okay.

3965
02:39:12,670 --> 02:39:13,290
We'll fix him.

3966
02:39:14,270 --> 02:39:14,890
It's okay.

3967
02:39:14,890 --> 02:39:17,370
There's free healthcare down in Mario Land.

3968
02:39:20,560 --> 02:39:21,360
Okay.

3969
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:23,220
Well, it's another virus.

3970
02:39:23,460 --> 02:39:23,940
You know what?

3971
02:39:25,900 --> 02:39:26,700
Wait.

3972
02:39:26,880 --> 02:39:27,680
Actually...

3973
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:28,120
No.

3974
02:39:28,360 --> 02:39:28,780
I think...

3975
02:39:31,480 --> 02:39:32,280
No.

3976
02:39:32,280 --> 02:39:33,420
I'm gonna make him fight one more.

3977
02:39:33,580 --> 02:39:34,060
It's okay.

3978
02:39:34,200 --> 02:39:35,060
I have Husky Goon.

3979
02:39:38,480 --> 02:39:39,000
Alright.

3980
02:39:42,460 --> 02:39:42,980
Uh...

3981
02:39:42,980 --> 02:39:43,940
Jodlock time.

3982
02:39:49,480 --> 02:39:51,880
I love the BGM in this game.

3983
02:39:52,900 --> 02:39:53,180
Niner.

3984
02:39:53,320 --> 02:39:53,420
Yeah.

3985
02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:54,740
You can't run away now.

3986
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:55,580
Got you in.

3987
02:39:55,580 --> 02:39:56,640
I locked you in.

3988
02:39:59,820 --> 02:40:00,600
That's right.

3989
02:40:01,700 --> 02:40:03,040
Get out of here.

3990
02:40:04,400 --> 02:40:05,320
The 1.

3991
02:40:05,560 --> 02:40:07,920
100 times I use a different mind.

3992
02:40:12,260 --> 02:40:12,820
Wait.

3993
02:40:12,820 --> 02:40:13,580
I learned body slam.

3994
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:14,260
Oh my god.

3995
02:40:14,480 --> 02:40:14,600
Okay.

3996
02:40:15,060 --> 02:40:15,400
Guys.

3997
02:40:15,580 --> 02:40:16,520
I know like...

3998
02:40:16,520 --> 02:40:18,740
I have two really good moves.

3999
02:40:18,960 --> 02:40:20,400
Swallow and spit up.

4000
02:40:22,340 --> 02:40:23,460
But then...

4001
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:25,500
Then he can body slam.

4002
02:40:25,680 --> 02:40:25,900
Okay.

4003
02:40:26,060 --> 02:40:26,220
Guys.

4004
02:40:26,820 --> 02:40:29,140
I think we all agree we replace spit.

4005
02:40:29,300 --> 02:40:29,440
Right?

4006
02:40:29,700 --> 02:40:30,460
We all...

4007
02:40:34,820 --> 02:40:37,880
I think we all agree.

4008
02:40:39,220 --> 02:40:41,800
Baby Yoshi only swallows.

4009
02:40:46,440 --> 02:40:47,380
Exactly.

4010
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:48,880
He ain't no quitter.

4011
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:53,560
I did not raise a quitter.

4012
02:40:54,980 --> 02:40:56,400
That's successful.

4013
02:40:58,060 --> 02:41:01,260
It's time!

4014
02:41:02,220 --> 02:41:03,660
Oh my god.

4015
02:41:04,200 --> 02:41:04,740
I've only...

4016
02:41:04,740 --> 02:41:06,160
I waited for this day.

4017
02:41:07,880 --> 02:41:10,720
I waited for this day.

4018
02:41:24,740 --> 02:41:25,820
Oh my god.

4019
02:41:25,980 --> 02:41:26,560
He can slap.

4020
02:41:27,640 --> 02:41:27,800
Alright.

4021
02:41:28,980 --> 02:41:29,540
Tail slap.

4022
02:41:30,120 --> 02:41:31,200
Stretch the foe with his tail.

4023
02:41:31,400 --> 02:41:31,520
Okay.

4024
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:32,120
That shit...

4025
02:41:32,120 --> 02:41:32,820
Move fucking sucks.

4026
02:41:32,860 --> 02:41:34,260
You're never whipping your tail.

4027
02:41:35,340 --> 02:41:36,380
Did not learn.

4028
02:41:36,380 --> 02:41:39,980
I see if there's a few bugs I gotta work out.

4029
02:41:40,340 --> 02:41:41,720
Everything seems to be running.

4030
02:41:42,140 --> 02:41:43,980
Thanks for helping me test everything, Mario.

4031
02:41:44,700 --> 02:41:45,500
What's that?

4032
02:41:45,660 --> 02:41:47,920
You need a passcode for Wario Studio?

4033
02:41:48,600 --> 02:41:49,700
That makes sense.

4034
02:41:49,860 --> 02:41:51,320
The second word is gonna.

4035
02:41:51,660 --> 02:41:52,720
But that's all I know.

4036
02:41:53,020 --> 02:41:54,520
Good luck cracking the code.

4037
02:41:54,680 --> 02:41:54,820
Alright.

4038
02:41:54,900 --> 02:41:55,480
Goodbye, Penny.

4039
02:41:56,260 --> 02:41:58,960
Mario found the second word to unlock WarioWare.

4040
02:41:59,280 --> 02:41:59,560
Gonna.

4041
02:42:00,600 --> 02:42:02,460
Congrats on winning the Battle Swap Challenge.

4042
02:42:02,740 --> 02:42:03,880
Here's your prize.

4043
02:42:05,100 --> 02:42:06,840
There should be a third evil, right?

4044
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:08,500
You guys said I was gonna get Chungus.

4045
02:42:09,500 --> 02:42:12,980
This is the only reason I didn't use a stone.

4046
02:42:13,840 --> 02:42:14,380
Okay.

4047
02:42:16,280 --> 02:42:16,840
Alright.

4048
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:17,720
I'm checking.

4049
02:42:18,040 --> 02:42:19,000
I'm making sure.

4050
02:42:20,300 --> 02:42:20,980
What was this?

4051
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:22,820
An uncanny toy like Amaton.

4052
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:24,860
And throw large rocks over it.

4053
02:42:24,860 --> 02:42:25,500
Okay.

4054
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:26,940
When does he evolve?

4055
02:42:29,140 --> 02:42:29,960
What level?

4056
02:42:32,420 --> 02:42:33,340
Oh, okay.

4057
02:42:33,980 --> 02:42:36,120
Level up one at level 36.

4058
02:42:36,520 --> 02:42:37,340
Okay, we're almost there.

4059
02:42:38,020 --> 02:42:38,340
Alright.

4060
02:42:41,580 --> 02:42:42,680
I need to know.

4061
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:43,580
Where are you?

4062
02:42:45,720 --> 02:42:46,280
Oops.

4063
02:42:46,740 --> 02:42:48,160
God, I always fuck it up.

4064
02:42:50,380 --> 02:42:52,240
When do you become my big boy?

4065
02:42:53,020 --> 02:42:55,260
This is the only reason I kept you.

4066
02:42:56,320 --> 02:42:57,980
I would have kept you as a baby.

4067
02:42:58,720 --> 02:42:58,840
Okay.

4068
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:00,720
Level one up to...

4069
02:43:00,720 --> 02:43:03,040
Yoshi evolves from baby Yoshi.

4070
02:43:03,420 --> 02:43:04,880
And then to level 50.

4071
02:43:05,120 --> 02:43:05,340
Okay.

4072
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:06,440
So, like...

4073
02:43:06,440 --> 02:43:11,260
The only reason why I kept him around as not baby Yoshi.

4074
02:43:11,780 --> 02:43:15,220
Is because I need him to level up to Chungus Yoshi.

4075
02:43:15,820 --> 02:43:19,940
Because Big Yoshi is, like, my favorite music song ever.

4076
02:43:19,940 --> 02:43:20,820
This is actually...

4077
02:43:20,820 --> 02:43:21,820
It lives, like...

4078
02:43:21,820 --> 02:43:25,760
Big Yoshi lounge lives rent free in my head for, like, the longest time.

4079
02:43:25,900 --> 02:43:27,460
Because it's actually, like, my favorite.

4080
02:43:27,700 --> 02:43:28,180
Oh, wait.

4081
02:43:29,100 --> 02:43:30,060
That's level...

4082
02:43:30,620 --> 02:43:31,100
Not...

4083
02:43:31,100 --> 02:43:31,620
Oh.

4084
02:43:32,080 --> 02:43:32,860
Oh, level up.

4085
02:43:32,960 --> 02:43:33,640
Okay, level up.

4086
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:33,880
Okay.

4087
02:43:34,600 --> 02:43:35,500
This is my...

4088
02:43:35,500 --> 02:43:36,820
One of my favorite songs.

4089
02:43:37,040 --> 02:43:38,300
I'm playing it right now.

4090
02:43:58,460 --> 02:44:04,360
I have a giant Yoshi acrylics...

4091
02:44:04,360 --> 02:44:04,580
Oh, no.

4092
02:44:04,760 --> 02:44:05,140
Sticker.

4093
02:44:05,720 --> 02:44:06,080
Like...

4094
02:44:06,080 --> 02:44:06,340
Wait.

4095
02:44:06,380 --> 02:44:07,100
Let me see what I...

4096
02:44:07,800 --> 02:44:08,760
It's somewhere.

4097
02:44:09,460 --> 02:44:09,980
Giant...

4098
02:44:10,940 --> 02:44:12,760
Big Yoshi sticker.

4099
02:44:13,460 --> 02:44:13,980
I...

4100
02:44:13,980 --> 02:44:14,500
I have...

4101
02:44:14,500 --> 02:44:15,920
It's, like...

4102
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:17,000
It's, like...

4103
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:17,960
Oh, it's this.

4104
02:44:18,180 --> 02:44:21,040
I literally own this extra large sticker.

4105
02:44:21,300 --> 02:44:23,440
But I don't know if there's, like, a size comparison.

4106
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:24,280
I found it.

4107
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:29,360
Oh, man.

4108
02:44:29,620 --> 02:44:30,460
It is...

4109
02:44:30,460 --> 02:44:30,580
Okay.

4110
02:44:30,580 --> 02:44:36,820
This giant ass extra large sticker is 9.5 inches.

4111
02:44:37,700 --> 02:44:38,220
Wait.

4112
02:44:38,340 --> 02:44:38,560
Is it?

4113
02:44:38,740 --> 02:44:38,920
Yeah.

4114
02:44:39,140 --> 02:44:40,760
It's 9.5 inches.

4115
02:44:41,060 --> 02:44:42,760
And I don't know what to do with it.

4116
02:44:42,820 --> 02:44:44,660
I just bought it just because I can.

4117
02:44:57,560 --> 02:44:58,340
You're right.

4118
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:03,180
All right.

4119
02:45:03,340 --> 02:45:05,940
Mr. fucking overconfidence guy there.

4120
02:45:09,520 --> 02:45:11,220
Oh, that's just not right.

4121
02:45:14,460 --> 02:45:15,300
All right.

4122
02:45:15,540 --> 02:45:16,680
Let's see the daycare.

4123
02:45:17,160 --> 02:45:18,800
Did you guys meet a baby?

4124
02:45:20,900 --> 02:45:21,740
It's you.

4125
02:45:21,900 --> 02:45:23,000
We're raising your capture.

4126
02:45:23,180 --> 02:45:23,800
My goodness.

4127
02:45:23,960 --> 02:45:25,280
Your capture had an egg.

4128
02:45:25,620 --> 02:45:26,540
You want it?

4129
02:45:26,620 --> 02:45:27,480
Yes, I do.

4130
02:45:27,700 --> 02:45:29,040
Of course I do.

4131
02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:29,880
All right.

4132
02:45:30,740 --> 02:45:31,740
Step aside.

4133
02:45:32,460 --> 02:45:34,200
We got to let a baby in here.

4134
02:45:34,580 --> 02:45:37,100
We got to step aside.

4135
02:45:38,660 --> 02:45:39,460
Congratulations.

4136
02:45:40,700 --> 02:45:42,100
Medi and Alan.

4137
02:45:42,680 --> 02:45:44,700
You guys made a child.

4138
02:45:46,020 --> 02:45:46,820
Yes.

4139
02:45:47,620 --> 02:45:50,000
I would like to have this child.

4140
02:45:50,300 --> 02:45:50,640
All right.

4141
02:45:52,240 --> 02:45:53,260
Where are you?

4142
02:45:54,060 --> 02:45:54,140
Where are you?

4143
02:45:54,140 --> 02:45:54,580
Oh, my God.

4144
02:45:54,700 --> 02:45:55,420
Look at you.

4145
02:45:57,280 --> 02:45:58,660
What will hatch from this?

4146
02:45:58,780 --> 02:45:59,940
It will take some time.

4147
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:00,740
Don't worry.

4148
02:46:02,800 --> 02:46:03,340
Oh, wait.

4149
02:46:03,680 --> 02:46:04,540
Medi and John.

4150
02:46:04,920 --> 02:46:05,580
Oh, my God.

4151
02:46:05,740 --> 02:46:06,620
Medi, John.

4152
02:46:07,440 --> 02:46:08,000
Congratulations.

4153
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:12,700
You have a new child.

4154
02:46:14,040 --> 02:46:16,900
I wonder if it's going to be a boy or a girl.

4155
02:46:17,720 --> 02:46:18,040
He he.

4156
02:46:20,420 --> 02:46:21,160
All right, Doki.

4157
02:46:21,420 --> 02:46:22,620
Hope you and dad is all okay.

4158
02:46:22,740 --> 02:46:23,420
Best wishes to see you.

4159
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:24,000
Thank you.

4160
02:46:24,180 --> 02:46:24,640
Thank you.

4161
02:46:26,420 --> 02:46:27,000
Thank you.

4162
02:46:27,060 --> 02:46:27,100
Thank you.

4163
02:46:27,100 --> 02:46:28,180
I really appreciate it.

4164
02:46:28,400 --> 02:46:29,360
Yeah, we're okay.

4165
02:46:29,700 --> 02:46:30,200
We're okay.

4166
02:46:30,420 --> 02:46:30,940
Thank you.

4167
02:46:31,100 --> 02:46:32,220
I really appreciate it.

4168
02:46:32,480 --> 02:46:32,720
All right.

4169
02:46:32,720 --> 02:46:33,300
Let's go in.

4170
02:46:34,060 --> 02:46:34,500
Mario.

4171
02:46:35,100 --> 02:46:35,540
Mario.

4172
02:46:37,180 --> 02:46:39,780
Boy, am I glad to see you, bro.

4173
02:46:39,780 --> 02:46:42,120
What are you doing here?

4174
02:46:44,680 --> 02:46:47,600
Oh, you're going into the haunted mansion?

4175
02:46:48,400 --> 02:46:50,000
You don't say.

4176
02:46:50,440 --> 02:46:52,980
I don't suppose you need your...

4177
02:46:52,980 --> 02:46:53,640
Go...

4178
02:46:53,640 --> 02:46:54,280
Brother?

4179
02:46:54,780 --> 02:46:54,920
No.

4180
02:46:55,640 --> 02:46:56,120
Oh, okay.

4181
02:46:56,620 --> 02:46:58,200
You can have it yourself.

4182
02:46:58,200 --> 02:46:59,340
I trust you.

4183
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:00,180
I don't need...

4184
02:47:00,180 --> 02:47:02,300
I don't need Luigi.

4185
02:47:03,100 --> 02:47:05,760
You may almost bankrupt Nintendo.

4186
02:47:07,240 --> 02:47:09,660
Anyway, to prove that I could totally...

4187
02:47:09,780 --> 02:47:11,160
Go inside, bro.

4188
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:12,880
If I wanted to...

4189
02:47:12,880 --> 02:47:13,660
Let's battle!

4190
02:47:14,040 --> 02:47:15,500
In front of my child?

4191
02:47:16,120 --> 02:47:18,460
In front of Medi and...

4192
02:47:18,460 --> 02:47:20,400
And John's child?

4193
02:47:20,920 --> 02:47:23,060
I'm going out for milk.

4194
02:47:23,460 --> 02:47:25,540
Medi, thank you for the super chat thing.

4195
02:47:25,740 --> 02:47:26,820
What the fuck?

4196
02:47:27,280 --> 02:47:28,340
Oh my god.

4197
02:47:28,340 --> 02:47:29,580
They're all naked.

4198
02:47:32,540 --> 02:47:34,760
Oh, your Goombas are naked.

4199
02:47:34,860 --> 02:47:35,560
I'm going to throw them.

4200
02:47:36,500 --> 02:47:37,220
Oh, wait.

4201
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:37,840
I never healed.

4202
02:47:38,620 --> 02:47:40,400
I forgot to heal.

4203
02:47:41,700 --> 02:47:42,340
Oops.

4204
02:47:43,080 --> 02:47:45,400
I knew I forgot something.

4205
02:47:46,360 --> 02:47:47,220
What is...

4206
02:47:47,220 --> 02:47:48,380
Okay, let me...

4207
02:47:48,380 --> 02:47:50,100
Let me heal them real quick.

4208
02:47:50,140 --> 02:47:51,080
Let me...

4209
02:47:51,080 --> 02:47:51,820
Um...

4210
02:47:51,820 --> 02:47:52,800
It's fine.

4211
02:47:53,120 --> 02:47:54,400
Everything will be fine.

4212
02:47:55,300 --> 02:47:55,880
Oh, wait.

4213
02:47:56,320 --> 02:47:56,760
All right.

4214
02:47:56,980 --> 02:47:57,380
Bubbles?

4215
02:47:57,500 --> 02:47:58,440
Who's Bubbles?

4216
02:47:59,320 --> 02:48:00,520
Oh my god.

4217
02:48:00,640 --> 02:48:00,980
Oh, wait.

4218
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:02,580
I should not put Bubbles out.

4219
02:48:02,700 --> 02:48:04,700
I should not put Dad out.

4220
02:48:04,700 --> 02:48:05,020
Okay.

4221
02:48:05,500 --> 02:48:06,260
Oh, no.

4222
02:48:06,440 --> 02:48:06,540
Wait.

4223
02:48:06,680 --> 02:48:07,840
No, we have Husky Goon.

4224
02:48:10,860 --> 02:48:12,580
Yeah, that's not okay.

4225
02:48:12,820 --> 02:48:13,240
It's okay.

4226
02:48:14,060 --> 02:48:14,740
Look, guys.

4227
02:48:14,920 --> 02:48:15,740
Type advantages.

4228
02:48:15,740 --> 02:48:16,880
I'm doing it.

4229
02:48:18,840 --> 02:48:19,340
Okay.

4230
02:48:19,440 --> 02:48:20,040
I have Vinewood.

4231
02:48:20,920 --> 02:48:21,360
What's that?

4232
02:48:21,860 --> 02:48:22,360
Octazooka?

4233
02:48:22,540 --> 02:48:22,980
Oh, yeah.

4234
02:48:23,680 --> 02:48:24,280
Oh, yeah.

4235
02:48:24,580 --> 02:48:25,540
I'm doing it.

4236
02:48:25,580 --> 02:48:26,440
I'm using types.

4237
02:48:29,240 --> 02:48:29,520
Yeah.

4238
02:48:32,380 --> 02:48:33,160
Go, Dad.

4239
02:48:33,380 --> 02:48:33,560
Go.

4240
02:48:34,140 --> 02:48:34,780
Bulk up.

4241
02:48:35,260 --> 02:48:36,080
What is bulk up?

4242
02:48:37,620 --> 02:48:38,180
Oh, yeah.

4243
02:48:38,200 --> 02:48:38,800
We don't need it.

4244
02:48:38,960 --> 02:48:39,360
It's okay.

4245
02:48:39,540 --> 02:48:39,900
You're...

4246
02:48:39,900 --> 02:48:40,600
You don't need to...

4247
02:48:40,600 --> 02:48:43,260
You don't need to take those powder drinks, guys.

4248
02:48:43,700 --> 02:48:44,540
Except if they're...

4249
02:48:44,540 --> 02:48:45,500
If it's Gamersupps, though.

4250
02:48:46,140 --> 02:48:46,960
But Dad doesn't.

4251
02:48:46,980 --> 02:48:48,320
He's already bulked up.

4252
02:48:48,420 --> 02:48:49,460
But it's okay, guys.

4253
02:48:49,500 --> 02:48:56,500
If you guys want to bulk up just like Dad, you can use my code DokiBird for 10-15% off at Gamersupps.

4254
02:48:57,580 --> 02:48:58,040
True.

4255
02:48:59,340 --> 02:49:01,560
Look, Dad is already too swole.

4256
02:49:01,700 --> 02:49:02,660
He doesn't need more.

4257
02:49:03,920 --> 02:49:05,360
I forgot who Bitey...

4258
02:49:05,360 --> 02:49:06,600
Oh, Bitey is the plant.

4259
02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:07,160
Yeah.

4260
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:09,500
Bitey is his piranha plant.

4261
02:49:09,660 --> 02:49:11,620
And I called him stupid for picking them.

4262
02:49:14,440 --> 02:49:15,040
Alright.

4263
02:49:15,280 --> 02:49:15,620
It's okay.

4264
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:18,240
I have...

4265
02:49:18,240 --> 02:49:19,740
What the fuck?

4266
02:49:20,620 --> 02:49:21,460
Oh, my God.

4267
02:49:21,640 --> 02:49:22,640
Somebody put him down.

4268
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:24,600
What the fuck is that?

4269
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:27,680
Bro.

4270
02:49:28,520 --> 02:49:29,620
What did you give him?

4271
02:49:30,240 --> 02:49:30,440
Bro.

4272
02:49:34,400 --> 02:49:36,280
What did you give your plant?

4273
02:49:40,730 --> 02:49:41,290
Alright.

4274
02:49:41,490 --> 02:49:41,850
Let's go.

4275
02:49:42,270 --> 02:49:42,550
Guys.

4276
02:49:42,650 --> 02:49:43,970
He definitely had...

4277
02:49:43,970 --> 02:49:45,830
This guy definitely had...

4278
02:49:45,830 --> 02:49:46,890
Definitely bulked up.

4279
02:49:51,370 --> 02:49:52,350
Oh, my God.

4280
02:49:52,470 --> 02:49:52,730
Luigi.

4281
02:49:52,730 --> 02:49:52,990
What did you...

4282
02:49:52,990 --> 02:49:54,550
What did you do to him?

4283
02:49:56,210 --> 02:49:56,710
He...

4284
02:49:56,710 --> 02:49:58,190
He used fertilizer.

4285
02:50:00,990 --> 02:50:03,050
He got him the good fertilizer.

4286
02:50:04,850 --> 02:50:05,910
He put him...

4287
02:50:05,910 --> 02:50:07,850
He put him with all the other Yoshis.

4288
02:50:08,110 --> 02:50:09,510
He grabbed the fertilizer.

4289
02:50:13,170 --> 02:50:13,670
Swagger.

4290
02:50:14,010 --> 02:50:15,690
You are not cool enough for this, Hefli.

4291
02:50:15,690 --> 02:50:16,970
Yeah, I know.

4292
02:50:21,770 --> 02:50:22,350
Alright.

4293
02:50:23,290 --> 02:50:23,870
No.

4294
02:50:24,530 --> 02:50:25,610
Who's the last one?

4295
02:50:27,150 --> 02:50:27,750
Wait, you...

4296
02:50:27,750 --> 02:50:29,130
Koopa never leveled up?

4297
02:50:29,290 --> 02:50:30,910
I think I got my balance back.

4298
02:50:31,230 --> 02:50:32,430
What's happening, bro?

4299
02:50:33,770 --> 02:50:34,350
Alright.

4300
02:50:34,590 --> 02:50:35,990
I'm throwing your turtle.

4301
02:50:36,430 --> 02:50:36,870
Never mind.

4302
02:50:39,010 --> 02:50:39,750
It's okay.

4303
02:50:39,750 --> 02:50:40,810
I'm paralyzed anyway.

4304
02:50:41,050 --> 02:50:41,290
Okay.

4305
02:50:44,730 --> 02:50:46,010
Get out of here.

4306
02:50:47,370 --> 02:50:48,250
That's right.

4307
02:50:48,490 --> 02:50:48,710
Leave.

4308
02:50:50,510 --> 02:50:50,830
Yeah.

4309
02:50:54,690 --> 02:50:55,810
Jeepers creepers.

4310
02:50:56,070 --> 02:50:57,150
Wait a second.

4311
02:50:57,790 --> 02:50:58,450
That's right.

4312
02:50:58,590 --> 02:50:59,450
Give me your 420.

4313
02:51:00,350 --> 02:51:00,710
Boy.

4314
02:51:01,030 --> 02:51:02,990
You really know how to fight, bro.

4315
02:51:03,490 --> 02:51:06,470
It looks like you don't need your brother in there with you.

4316
02:51:06,930 --> 02:51:07,870
I told you no.

4317
02:51:09,050 --> 02:51:09,430
Okay.

4318
02:51:09,730 --> 02:51:11,090
I guess I see you around, bro.

4319
02:51:12,490 --> 02:51:14,250
You're all so loud.

4320
02:51:15,330 --> 02:51:16,170
Come on.

4321
02:51:16,350 --> 02:51:17,690
I don't have all day.

4322
02:51:18,090 --> 02:51:18,350
Okay.

4323
02:51:18,350 --> 02:51:19,050
I need a heal.

4324
02:51:19,250 --> 02:51:20,930
I forgot the heal last time.

4325
02:51:21,750 --> 02:51:22,210
Um...

4326
02:51:22,210 --> 02:51:22,470
Where?

4327
02:51:22,710 --> 02:51:24,930
Where is the Pokemon Center?

4328
02:51:26,110 --> 02:51:27,410
Where is it?

4329
02:51:27,870 --> 02:51:28,430
Okay.

4330
02:51:28,430 --> 02:51:29,650
I walked in a circle.

4331
02:51:29,670 --> 02:51:30,310
Oh, there it is.

4332
02:51:31,110 --> 02:51:31,550
Alright.

4333
02:51:32,510 --> 02:51:34,230
I'm gonna call it here.

4334
02:51:34,370 --> 02:51:35,810
So I can rest my voice.

4335
02:51:35,810 --> 02:51:37,370
And I talked a lot.

4336
02:51:37,790 --> 02:51:39,810
And there were so many toads.

4337
02:51:41,990 --> 02:51:45,930
But I always have a great time with you guys.

4338
02:51:46,070 --> 02:51:47,450
It's great to be back again.

4339
02:51:48,250 --> 02:51:48,850
Um...

4340
02:51:48,850 --> 02:51:50,550
We have a long week this week.

4341
02:51:50,730 --> 02:51:52,270
So lots of streams this week.

4342
02:51:52,750 --> 02:51:53,170
Um...

4343
02:51:53,170 --> 02:51:54,990
But thank you guys for coming.

4344
02:51:55,290 --> 02:51:58,890
I hope you guys enjoyed part 2 of Super Mario Mon.

4345
02:51:59,010 --> 02:52:02,550
It was great to see Alpha Rat join in and watching me.

4346
02:52:02,550 --> 02:52:05,750
It was really a huge honor that he watched my playthrough.

4347
02:52:06,030 --> 02:52:07,830
So thank you for stopping by.

4348
02:52:08,170 --> 02:52:11,390
And thank you Dragon's 2 for watching today.

4349
02:52:12,550 --> 02:52:13,130
Um...

4350
02:52:13,130 --> 02:52:13,990
I'm gonna call it here.

4351
02:52:14,090 --> 02:52:15,270
I'm gonna rest my voice now.

4352
02:52:15,430 --> 02:52:17,150
Because there were so many toads.

4353
02:52:17,550 --> 02:52:17,870
There...

4354
02:52:18,470 --> 02:52:21,110
There were so many toads.

4355
02:52:23,370 --> 02:52:24,330
Hey guys.

4356
02:52:24,570 --> 02:52:25,910
As always everybody.

4357
02:52:26,290 --> 02:52:27,510
Stay hydrated.

4358
02:52:28,030 --> 02:52:28,750
Pause your check.

4359
02:52:29,170 --> 02:52:30,150
Get up and move around.

4360
02:52:30,330 --> 02:52:31,390
Get that blood flowing.

4361
02:52:31,830 --> 02:52:32,990
And if you stay up for me.

4362
02:52:33,190 --> 02:52:33,910
Head to bed.

4363
02:52:34,090 --> 02:52:35,390
Because you deserve it.

4364
02:52:35,390 --> 02:52:37,050
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

4365
02:52:37,470 --> 02:52:38,510
Bye guys.

4366
02:52:38,950 --> 02:52:39,410
Bye.

4367
02:52:41,270 --> 02:52:43,690
Also ending stream is a little different.

4368
02:52:44,170 --> 02:52:44,630
Now...

4369
02:52:44,630 --> 02:52:46,610
We have a new addition in the ending stream.

4370
02:52:47,050 --> 02:52:47,790
Bye bye everyone.

4371
02:52:48,090 --> 02:52:48,410
Bye.
