No, no animation.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,980
No waiting animation.

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:05,620
We out.

5
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,260

6
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:06,720
All right.

7
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,560
The hoes are watching.

8
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:08,380
Yeah.

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,440
Altair, what was that catchphrase that you wanted to say
after that?

10
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,380
Suck it, nerds.

11
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,100
Oh, no.

12
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,420
He did not say that.

13
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,300
It was not nerds.

14
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,700
It was sucking something, but it wasn't nerds.

15
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,880
Suck it, noobs.

16
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,080
The hoes are watching.

17
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:25,900
All right.

18
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,280
Come on, Altair.

19
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,800
You know you want to say it.

20
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,640
It starts with a P. Pokemon.

21
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,280
Dang, of course he's into that.

22
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:38,940
You guys are trying to get me.

23
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,680
You guys are trying to get all my videos restricted, huh?

24
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,260
No, no, of course not.

25
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,440
Oh, no, we would never do that to you.

26
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,000
Because if your videos get restricted, our videos get
restricted too, because we're streaming with you.

27
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,980
Hey, mine gets restricted anyways.

28
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,700
It don't really matter.

29
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,580
Oh, that's true.

30
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:53,900
That's true.

31
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,240
I got my Garfield video restricted because I sang a very
inappropriate song.

32
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,580
I sang a very inappropriate song as Garfield.

33
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,740
Garfield's thing's inappropriate songs?

34
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,260
Yeah, it was, yeah.

35
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,480
I thought inappropriate songs only existed like Rick and
Morty and South Park and shit for you.

36
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,440
Like, you know, I said I was rapping a very inappropriate
song.

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,000
What was it about?

38

Give us a context.

39
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,280
Why was it so inappropriate?

40
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,520
It was like, you know, Lonely Island.

41
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,500
You know, Lonely Island.

42
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,660

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:44,140

close enough close enough yeah one fucking one saves lives

70
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:52,520
the other you take lives i mean technically the doctor can
do both if you want to but nah nah it's designed to take

they all yeah they got them see the hose are watching like i

77
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:51,160
said watching bro all right party axel as a doctor join
party have you taken the Hippocratic oath or are you just a

78
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,640
hypocrite?

79
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,080
I don't think he's like, I don't think he's a servant.

80
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:54,820
Oh, okay.

81
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,980
Yeah, he definitely has not taken the Hippocratic oath.

82
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,160
I don't know what a hypocrite is.

83
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,860
He really is a doctor that can kill.

84
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,880
He is a doctor that can kill.

85
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:11,800
So a Hippocratic oath is something that every doctor takes
to make, that basically means you don't kill.

86
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,080
That's like the whole premise.

87
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,380
Nah, fuck that shit, dude.

88
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,200
Like, that's the oath.

89
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,200
You make an oath that you would never kill.

90
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,900
I am making an oath on something I can't promise, you know?

91
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:24,740
That's true.

92
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,440
What if I walk in the room and then they decide to blow
himself up?

93
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,300
You know, like, that's not really on me.

94
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,360
That's not your fault.

95
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,580
But it's gonna look like I did it.

96
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,580
Dude, I walk out of it.

97
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,740
How would it look like you did it?

98
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,840
Wait, you carry a bomb around you all the time as a doctor?

99
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,800
Yeah, you never know when the next Hector Salamanca is gonna
appear in a fucking room, you know?

100
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,460
Why would you carry a bomb around you?

101
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,200
Just carry a gun!

102
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,240
Is the house Hector Salamanca?

103
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,660
Well, I mean, it's easy.

104
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,740
A bomb can come in handy.

105
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,300
Ooh, talking about a bomb.

106
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,860

I was a bomber.

Well, physically damage and mental damage.

272
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,320
Mental damage is sometimes more important to one another.

273
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:57,740
That's true.

274
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,740

I was gonna test it out with someone.

328
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,540
There isn't.

329
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,500
Alright.

330
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,140
Who'd you shoot?

331
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,100
You shot me!

332
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,780
No, I didn't.

333
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,900
You don't have proof.

334
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,080
So you didn't take damage.

335
00:19:59,320 --> 00:19:59,520
Wow.

336
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,120
I can't believe you was shooting me like that.

337
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,900
You have no proof.

338
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,860
You took no damage.

339
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,520
I saw it in the mud.

340
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,640
Alright, let's see.

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,440

You baited me.

352
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,160

damage.

That wasn't a squad right, though.

366
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:16,980
Homeboy died.

372
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,960
He's peeking through the...

373
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,520
Oh, that's how he died.

374
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:25,960
That's how he died.

375
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,400

376
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:26,860
That's how he died.

377
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,920
He has a missile.

378
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,440
He's right here.

379
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:30,940

00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,880
Well, you know what?

381
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,160

00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,700
Yeah, I believe in you.

383
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,180

387
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,580

00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,880
Where the fuck is our guy?

400
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,620
Maybe inside?

401
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,020
Oh, he says the bazooka.

402
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,080
Yeah, he died, dad.

403
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,560
Don't worry.

404
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,160
He'll redeploy.

405
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,340
Mr. High Assassin.

406
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,720
Yeah, he's coming back.

407
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,620
He got kicked out of hell.

408
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,010
Whoa!

409
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:07,710

411
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:08,430

412
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,370

413
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:11,950
Oh, no.

414
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,790

I've got a scout.

419
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,550
I'll take high ground.

420
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,770
I don't know where high ground is.

421
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:24,630
I'm going to...

422
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,790
There's somewhere on the left side, I think.

423
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,470
I don't think I can take high ground.

424
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,110
Toes on the left.

425
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:30,490

433
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,190
So, they parachuted.

434
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:38,370
Granade!

00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,270
There's two holes in the truck.

On the left side.

563
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,910

00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:57,220
okay so like i don't know what the high assassin is doing
But how did he play this game?

598
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,360
How did he play this game to 53 levels and still play like
this?

599
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,460
Oh, hey, a loot box.

Oh, hey.

601
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,340
Mr. High Assassin only plays like an assassin.

602
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,280
He's just mad at him.

603
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,840
I know.

604
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,140
That means he's been doing this for, like, since Battle
Royale was released.

605
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,540
All he did is just hide.

606
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,060
I don't think he's ever won a game in his life.

607
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,380
All right, here we go.

608
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,780
Oh, he is, Mr. High Assassin.

609
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,200

00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,000

862
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,380
Do we leave?

863
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,340
Oh, whoa, whoa, I missed you.

00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:01,700

874
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,120
Well, that was nothing.

875
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,020
That airstrike fucking sucked.

876
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,700
That was like one shot.

877
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,660
You can.

878
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,120
We gotta get into zone.

879
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:53,860
Are we not in zone?

880
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,780
Oh, we are not in zone.

881
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:55,280
Yeah.

882
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,640
We ain't in zone.

883
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,160
Okay, so there might be a team over here, so you gotta be
careful.

884
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,620
They're right below us.

885
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,200
Right below us.

886
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:03,560
Okay.

887
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,200
I am right above them.

888
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:08,460
Oh, wait, wait.

889
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:08,900
It's right here!

890
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,120
Oh, shit!

891
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,140
Oh my god.

892
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:12,940
Oh my god.

893
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:13,960
That was not a teammate.

894
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,700
That was not a teammate.

895
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,060
That was not with me.

896
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,820
Why me?

897
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,120
There's a long range weapon here if anyone wants to.

898
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:24,720
I just looked at him.

899
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,100
I just looked at him.

900
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,060
Yeah, I was like, I was wondering why you were looking at
him.

901
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:30,920
Did he have armor?

902
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,300
No, he doesn't.

903
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,700
Oh yeah, I saw rifle.

904
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:34,940
I'll upgrade that.

905
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,780
Oh, there's a sniper rifle too.

906
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,220
Oh, squad white.

907
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:38,960
Nice.

908
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,800
Does there have extra armor?

909
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,020
I can give you some armor.

910
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:43,880
I got a few.

911
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:44,940
Yeah, I have one.

912
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:45,580
How do I drop it?

913
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,120
How do I drop this?

914
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:47,880
Oh, you're right.

915
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,700
All right.

916
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:50,920
Drop some armor here.

917
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,100
What the heck is that?

918
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,360
The Fortnite built everything.

919
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,340
I am...

920
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:54,680
Yeah, see that?

921
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,720
I'm armoring up.

922
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,240
I'm armoring up.

923
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,380
What the hell is that?

924
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,780
What are you guys looking at?

925
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,920
I just saw it fought.

926
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:01,900
East 30.

927
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:02,400
East 30.

928
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,160
East 30.

929
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,130
Jesus Christ.

930
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,200
All right.

931
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,700
No more second chance, ladies.

932
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,120
Oh, all right.

933
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,140
We don't need second chance.

934
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:09,620
We're gamers.

935
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:10,780
Not ammo.

936
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:11,800
Oh, okay.

937
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,400
That's not good.

938
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,060
Never mind.

939
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:13,800
Where are you guys?

940
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,760
Where are they shooting?

941
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:15,780
Where are you shooting at?

942
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,540
East 30 up the hill.

943
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:18,600
There's a floating platform.

944
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:18,940
Oh, my God.

945
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:19,480
Wait, they aren't?

946
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,120
Oh, my God.

947
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,200
Wait, he hits that?

948
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,620
Yeah, he's kind of crazy.

949
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,100
I don't even know.

950
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:25,920
He's crazy with that.

951
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,580
I don't even know, like, my drop off for this.

952
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,020
Wait, they are actually hitting.

953
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,360
As I'm saying, I don't even know the drop off for this.

954
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,000
Holy shit, they said, they really said, let me hit.

955
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,540
And I was like, yeah, okay.

956
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,600
Okay, I need to be high.

957
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,260
He has to be high.

958
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,500
There's a car below us.

959
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,780
Okay, we gotta go to the zone.

960
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,220
Guys, guys, guys, we gotta go to the zone.

961
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:51,660
I'm leaving.

962
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,840
Okay, I'm heading over there.

963
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,700
Oh, I'm serpentine.

964
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,980
Yeah, I'm moving into zone.

965
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm moving too.

966
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,540
I'm moving as well with you.

967
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,260
I'm right behind you.

968
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,820
They're still trying, the fortnighters are still trying to
shoot at us.

969
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,060
It's okay.

970
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,260
Let them fortnight, you know?

971
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,980
Alright, I see gunshots to our left.

972
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,260
I hear gunshots to our left.

973
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:18,820
But how far?

974
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:21,480
Oh, we are so far from zone.

975
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:22,800
Wee!

976
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,200
Wee!

977
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,140
You can cut these people off at chemical storage ahead of
us.

978
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,880
Wait, where the fuck are you going?

979
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,440
We gotta go in a zone.

980
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,380
It's the blue ship, right?

981
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:32,840
We gotta go.

982
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,540
Yeah, I was just shooting at the guys on the left.

983
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,020
Oh, okay.

984
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:35,740
Cause I was just saying.

985
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,420
People on the left.

986
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:37,440
Yeah, yeah.

987
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,200
People behind us.

988
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:39,920
Behind us?

989
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,460
Oh, I'm looking.

990
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,400
Oh, he's behind that box.

991
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,940
Oh, you are so close to the zone, the zone, the zone,
though.

992
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:47,560
Let's see.

993
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,380
Running, running.

994
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,420
I'm running.

995
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,540
I'm with...

996
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,380
I'm with Altair right now.

997
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,760
That people...

998
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,700
Uh, West 330.

999
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,240
West 330.

1000
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,700
They're running away.

1001
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:01,920
They're running away.

1002
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,600
I'm going right.

1003
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,740
Who the fuck is that an artillery drop?

1004
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:06,880
Yeah.

1005
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,780
I might be the first one that gets shot at, and I also have
the least HP.

1006
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,760
So, good luck to me.

1007
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,160
I don't know how to drop any to you.

1008
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:14,720
I'm sorry.

1009
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,280
It's okay.

1010
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:15,800
It's okay.

1011
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,980
I just got cocky and stood in front of a sniper.

1012
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,880
I have high ground though.

1013
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,060
I got high ground.

1014
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,200
I've got the high ground now, donkey bird.

1015
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,400
I don't have high ground very soon.

1016
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,020
I don't have high ground anymore.

1017
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,840
I'm so scared.

1018
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,620
I don't see anyone beside me.

1019
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,780
Wait, Hades is so far away.

1020
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:50,490
Absentee teammate.

1021
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:52,550
Yeah, he's so far.

1022
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:54,950
Let's see.

1023
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:58,990
Hey, welcome back.

00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,250
Oh, you can cut.

1027
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:04,090
You can just cut.

1028
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:06,550
Wait, I hear I hear I hear a car.

00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:08,250

true.

1213
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:58,840
We look for a new puppy.

1214
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:06,260
Yeah, we're looking for, we're scouting for a new, we're
gonna put you back in the shelter and adopt a new kid.

1215
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:07,620
No!

1216
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,560
Go back to the orphan as you go.

1217
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,700
It just wasn't a match.

1218
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,960
I think I'd be open for adoption.

1219
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,220
Not me being adopting, but me adopting someone.

1220
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:20,760
Maybe in the future.

1221
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,980
How much can you make from that?

1222
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,320
What do you mean, adopting?

1223
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:25,860
That's what's not about profit, man.

1224
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:29,540
Yeah, it's called, it's like, you know, they say like couch
whipping, right?

1225
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,440
Well, oh, you mean like welfare.

1226
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:36,640
Like, the more kids you adopt, the more the money the
government gives you.

1227
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:38,160
No, no, no.

1228
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,500
It's like couch whipping, right?

1229
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,380
So you invest in the kids, right?

1230
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:42,080
That you adopt.

1231
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:46,180
So then they go to a good university, like Harvard and shit,
let's say.

1232
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:47,960
And then they take good care of you, right?

1233
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,520
It's an investment.

1234
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,440
Yeah, yeah.

1235
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,360
That's all children.

1236
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:56,120
Or you just start Project LeBron James, and you know, like,
dingles out for Harambee.

1237
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:01,760
yeah just be like come on come on lebron let me adopt your

01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:28,510
No, there's three people here.

1461
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:36,410
I don't think I got covered, guys.

1462
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:37,090
I don't.

1463
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:39,710
Dang.

1464
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:43,270
There's a guy on the top of the hill, by the way.

1465
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:46,390
Whoa.

1466

13.

1472
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:01,430
You know what?

1473
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:02,010
That's a 13.

1474
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:04,550
Not top 10, though.

1475
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:05,270
Wait.

1476
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:06,510
Hades.

1477
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:14,590
Convince us not to kick you.

1478
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:23,370
Why should we keep you for another game?

1479
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:26,490
Because I'm cool.

1480
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:28,750
Fight for your spot, Hades.

1481
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:31,950
Who left the lobby?

1482
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:34,410
Wait, did he leave the lobby?

1483
01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:35,350
There's no way.

1484
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:38,510
No, he said bad.

1485
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:39,850
No, he's bad already.

1486
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:45,690
I can't believe it.

1487
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:47,250
He's not trying to convince us.

1488
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:48,830
He left our party.

1489
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:49,870
Wait, he left?

1490
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:51,570
Uh-oh.

1491
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:53,990
You guys made him nod.

1492
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:55,870
No, it wasn't me.

1493
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:57,090
It wasn't me.

1494
01:12:57,150 --> 01:12:58,990
I think it's because someone didn't cover us.

1495
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:02,670
I was covering you.

1496
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,070
I was watching these people very gently.

1497
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:06,830
He left because someone else didn't cover us.

1498
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:08,090
wasn't me.

1499
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:10,550
Axel, why didn't you cover her?

1500
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:12,410
Yeah, Axel, why didn't you cover us?

1501
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:13,810
I was dead.

1502
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:15,730
Come on, Axel.

1503
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:18,050
Yeah, but like you could have not been dead.

You could have been alive.

This rat is falling for me.

1508
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:26,310
You know, all in all, Hades was pretty cool.

1509
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:29,190
Yeah, he was pretty.

1510
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:30,590
He was pretty.

1511
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:31,490
He was pretty pretty, all right.

01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:33,990
He was cool.

1513
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:34,890

1539
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:30,400
Pantera.

1540
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:44,460

still wouldn't do it he'd let that guy die we're open to

1541
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:55,480

opening auditions for the newest English wave of this is the

1542
01:15:55,480 --> 01:16:02,820
replace Axel series they will be my test subjects.

1543
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:08,780
What will happen to a human if you put them in, you know,
like in a pressure cooker?

1544
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:11,020
Why a pressure cooker?

1545
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,400
Ooh, I wonder what would happen.

1546
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,580
I feel like someone has done it before.

1547
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:22,140
Well, it depends on what would happen to this poor little
man if I put in a microwave.

1548
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:23,140
I mean, radiation.

1549
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:26,800
I'll just be the next Mr. Beast.

1550
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,080
What would happen if I put someone in a microwave?

1551
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,420
You know, he made his own Mr. Park in Dubai.

1552
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,260
Yeah, he made Mr. Beastland.

1553
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,200
I bet we could do that.

1554
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:40,820
Yeah, we can make...

1555
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:42,720
I'll be like, yeah, Naruto and Sakai.

1556
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:44,560
Mr. Beast, he's like a counterpart.

1557
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:47,220
There's Mr. Beast and then there's Mr. Beastiality.

1558
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,740
Whoa, okay, that's a very different thing.

1559
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,540
So I don't...

1560
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:53,020
I don't know, yeah.

1561
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,380
That's a very, very different thing.

1562
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,300
It's not too different.

1563
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,020
So what do you do, what do you do on that land?

1564
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:00,580
Can you please explain?

1565
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:03,820
You put people in microwaves.

1566
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:07,840
So, so, so.

1567
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:09,440
How are you a businessman, Axel?

1568
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,100
So why would these people come to your land?

1569
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,700
I want to go to Axel's land because I want to die.

1570
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:20,180
It's the next thing.

1571
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:22,880
It's not even like humane either, you know?

1572
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,920
It's not even like a humane way to die.

1573
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:27,600
Well, that's for them to decide if it's humane or not, you
know?

1574
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:38,660
I think that's up to, I think that's up to like, I don't
know, the UN to decide what's the UN what do you mean what's

1575
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:54,800

targeted and died.

01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:58,450
I mean, if we have a card, I think it's fine.

West.

1607
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,020

Cut the fence.

01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:07,540
I did not realize that.

1618
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:08,140
She figured it out.

1620
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:11,780
No assistance whatsoever.

1621
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:14,740
With a pencil and a pen, she figured it out.

1622
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,180
Wait, where did you say people were out there?

1623
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:22,180

Yeah, I got this.

2056
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,220
I believe in you.

2057
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:51,900
I'm like, oh yeah, chemistry was hard.

2058
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,560
You know, biology was the easiest.

2059
01:43:54,320 --> 01:44:00,940
physics was my favorite like physics really physics is hard
as well it was just all math it was just all equations you

2060
01:44:00,940 --> 01:44:06,240
just plug in man it's easy biology is the easy you just have
to remember like which part of the limb you want to rip off

2061
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:14,420
on someone and then oh did you dissect frogs wait they're
higher they're resting someone oh yeah a sheep's brain oh i

2062
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:22,620
dissected a frog really i detected a like a sheep's oh where
did you go Axel?

2063
01:44:22,940 --> 01:44:26,380
Oh, did they think I was like some criminal talking about
Are you checking people?

2064
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:27,800
Where did you go, Axel?

2065
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:28,760
What happened to you?

2066
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:34,120
Maybe the game was like, No, no, you were not allowed to
play the game.

2067
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:36,700
Wait, how did this guy get down?

2068
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:38,260
What?

2069
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:41,100
How did that happen?

2070
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:44,320
We're trying to resurrect Axel and then...

2071
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,160
Oh my god, and the axe just disappeared.

2072
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:48,440
It kicked me.

2073
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:49,060
Why?

2074
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:50,940
Yeah, I was going to say, what happened to you?

2075
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:53,960
Maybe I was too much of a menace in the game, you know?

2076
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:55,140
Yeah, that's what I got.

2077
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:56,940
Filtered, maybe.

2078
01:44:57,100 --> 01:44:57,700
Just too good.

2079
01:44:57,940 --> 01:44:58,640
I don't think I have a...

2080
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:00,980
He's talking about ripping off the limbs and shit.

2081
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:02,460
What's this?

2082
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:05,400
I think I might be dead, boys.

2083
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:08,700
Oh, there you see that?

2084
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,280
Yeah, I don't think I'm heading there.

2085
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:13,160
Yeah.

2086
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:14,720
This is what I mean, like, remember?

2087
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:18,880
I was like, oh, you know, when I get on the plane and shit,
I just pray like we don't have research.

2088
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:20,960
I was talking about biology and...

2089
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:21,100

2117
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:07,980
He's going to report him for harassment.

2118
01:48:08,380 --> 01:48:09,780
No, we can't be.

2119
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:10,200
Wait.

2120
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:11,100

Okay.

2122
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:16,160
We can't be reported for harassment if we each send him one
message.

2123
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:19,000
Maybe even two messages from each of us.

2124
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:28,040
but i'm asking him for a shawarma that he's gonna report me
for harassment there's no way we're just being really men

2125
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:33,780
don't have the same muscles that stimulate that get
stimulated during periods so they're kind of scams wait but

2126
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:41,100
then okay well the women have pain simulators of ball sack
like ball sack pain simulators do they have that i don't

2127
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:47,660
think i think i don't think that's possible should we kick
jokey and try oh okay like you know what you're knowing like

2128
01:48:47,660 --> 01:48:51,560
i know how to self-defend It's a science.

2129
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:52,480
It's science.

2130
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:59,080
Like, you attack your ball sack and then, like, a simulator
and then you hit that, and then it, like, imitates the

2131
01:48:59,080 --> 01:48:59,780
damage.

2132
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:00,940
The damage?

2133
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:01,460
Oh, yeah.

2134
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:03,620
To cancel your bloodline.

2135
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,280
Oh, why am I, like, a control variant?

2136
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:07,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2137
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:08,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2138
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:12,060
We'll find someone else to do that for us.

2139
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:12,380
Why?

2140
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:13,520
Any volunteers?

2141
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:17,320
We are, like, the scientists, observe.

2142
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:19,140
We're not the participants, guys.

2143
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:33,420
have xx is his name yeah he's born on he's 69 nice on the
69th day of april nice you can tell that you can tell he's

2144
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:35,440
not a zoomer because it's not 67.

2145
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:45,760
you know we could have gone this entire collab without
saying that i was what is up with american people in 67 man

2146
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:48,100
i have no idea where it came it's from like

2147
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:58,200
It's it's it's something it came from a rapper but then it
came from some chat on TikTok and he does like the hand

2148
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:00,580
thing like the six seven six seven.

2149
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:02,820
Oh, you know, I found out.

2150
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:03,140
Okay.

2151
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:10,260
So like Marvel Rivals recently had like this the land the
finals land where it was like a million dollars and then

2152
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:16,820
they were doing like team introduction and one of the teams
everyone was like six seven like as their team intro and I

2153
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:18,740
was like what the and I asked about it.

2154
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:26,940
Apparently it was like the it was like the media person who
directed the intro they'd be like guys we gotta do something

2155
01:50:26,940 --> 01:50:36,160
fun and relatable why don't you guys start doing six seven
as your team intro and i was like and the relatable and then

2156
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:43,960
the day became the villains of the esports world yeah
they're like guys we got these guys why don't we guys do

2157
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:50,540
something funny and relatable why don't you do the six seven
pose for your team intro so you guys see the i think it was

2158
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:57,840
you guys check out the dark zero um the dark zero team intro
for the land and you see all of them who the six seven that

2159
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:09,720
was because of the media person that told them they did not
it was not like it was not consensual so that's what it

2160
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:23,380
means to be pr trained now it's not consensual six seven
they not they are trained They were told they were told to

2161
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:23,880
do it.

2162
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:26,360
Ooh, a sniper.

2163
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:28,060
Ooh, what do we consume?

2164
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:29,060
I have a...

2165
01:51:29,060 --> 01:51:31,660
The brain rot is consuming everyone.

2166
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:35,120
Hey, I had probably never watched Skippity Toilet, so I
think I'm...

2167
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:36,560
I think I'm doing okay.

2168
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:39,820
I had the Skippity Toilet backpack on Fortnite.

2169
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:41,240
I paid for it.

2170
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:44,520
You and I were...

2171
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:45,700
We are not the same.

2172
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:48,120
I'm better.

2173
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,560
I'm... I'm hip with the kids.

2174
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:50,780

2177
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:17,960
was e like that one that i don't know how the that one got

2178
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:18,700
blown up

2179
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:24,880

2188
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,620
Mi-gusta was pretty pretty.

2189
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:42,340
Troll-lo-lo-lo.

2190
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:44,800
Troll-lo-lo-lo-lo.

2191
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:49,240
I mean, trolling, rage bait is basically new gen trolling.

2192
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:50,860
Yeah, rage bait is basically a new gen trolling.

2193
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:57,340
he's literally just trolling yeah rage bait is new gen
trolling that's literally what it means it's just what do

2194
01:52:57,340 --> 01:53:04,320
you think is more derogatory though rage bait or troll i
think trolling is just it it doesn't age well the tournament

2195
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:11,240
is just not as good i think yeah i i'd actually argue the
opposite i think trolling is actually doing okay no it's

2196
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:16,760
it's kind of like for fun but then but rage baiting you you
you thrive off the suffering for the people and that's a

2197
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:22,860
little bit too much no i love the word gaslighting that's my
favorite oh gaslighting me too it's like basically

2198
01:53:22,860 --> 01:53:26,820
manipulation but like but it sounds nice

2199
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:40,640
despite going i remember when i first debuted our management
was like so don't use the word gaslighting it's not a good

2200
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:46,540
word wait what really and i'm like really careful at the
beginning yeah and i'm like stop trying to gaslight me man

2201
01:53:46,540 --> 01:53:53,720
it's not a bad it's like the overwatch league where they
said nope they weren't allowed to use the pepe frog because

2202
01:53:53,720 --> 01:54:06,000
they thought it was like a really offensive infantry people
were like penalized if they used a pepe frog not pepe man

2203
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:13,000
yeah yeah and then i remember like uh some overwatch players
they got like uh they have to pay fines if they start

2204
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:25,700
t-bagging people that was crazy that's the though yeah let's

there's a fucking fence on top.

2241
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:46,040
There's, like, a green tarp on it, you know?

I was like, bro, there's a tarp on it.

2243
01:56:48,100 --> 01:56:49,260
There's no way I can knife that.

2244
01:56:49,660 --> 01:56:50,420
That's a very strong-ass tarp.

2245
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:51,680
You just gotta believe in yourself, Doki.

2246
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:53,460
I did not believe in myself.

2247
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:55,320
You just gotta believe.

2248
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:57,720

01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:02,720
I'm in a good place.

2252
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:05,740

2253
01:57:05,860 --> 01:57:06,140

Wait, where did that airstrike come from?

2257
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:15,640

Nah, nah.

If it's your allies, they'll be green, you know?

2261
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:27,700
You can tell the difference between green and red.

2262
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:29,760
Oh, I didn't see the color.

2263
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:31,000

2264
01:57:32,140 --> 01:57:32,420

01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:46,880
I cast a spell where you become blind, mute, and death.

2273
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:49,620
And you lose your limbs.

2274
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:51,740

02:02:14,370 --> 02:02:15,170
Right below us.

2352
02:02:15,330 --> 02:02:15,870
Oh, they're both.

2353
02:02:15,890 --> 02:02:17,650
Okay, it's fine.

2354
02:02:18,010 --> 02:02:18,270
It's fine.

2355
02:02:19,030 --> 02:02:19,830
It's not fine.

2356
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:21,310
It's not fine.

2357
02:02:21,710 --> 02:02:22,370
It is not fine.

2358
02:02:23,110 --> 02:02:23,330
It is not fine.

2359
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:24,310
It is not fine.

2360
02:02:24,310 --> 02:02:24,750
It is so not fine.

2361
02:02:25,510 --> 02:02:26,290
Oh no.

2362
02:02:27,670 --> 02:02:28,890
What is the zip here?

2363
02:02:30,090 --> 02:02:31,590
Oh my god, bro.

2364
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:34,410
That guy was crazy though.

2365
02:02:34,570 --> 02:02:36,350
He was hitting nasty eyes shots.

2366
02:02:38,050 --> 02:02:38,990
I'm watching him.

2367
02:02:39,650 --> 02:02:41,490
What the fuck is a zip on this building?

2368
02:02:41,710 --> 02:02:41,890
Oh my god.

2369
02:02:42,170 --> 02:02:43,070
Give me a zip line somewhere.

2370
02:02:43,450 --> 02:02:44,470
Wait, he knows his utility.

2371
02:02:44,670 --> 02:02:45,110
Oh, never mind.

2372
02:02:45,210 --> 02:02:45,450
He's dead.

2373
02:02:47,850 --> 02:02:48,650
It's up to you.

2374
02:02:48,950 --> 02:02:49,410
It's up to you.

2375
02:02:49,650 --> 02:02:50,310
It's one guy left.

2376
02:02:50,430 --> 02:02:50,770
It's one guy.

2377
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:51,890
Trust me.

2378
02:02:52,670 --> 02:02:53,370
Axel's serious.

2379
02:02:53,810 --> 02:02:54,530
It's really unfortunate.

2380
02:02:54,790 --> 02:02:55,550
But you're our only hope.

2381
02:02:55,670 --> 02:02:55,950
Oh, wait.

2382
02:02:56,070 --> 02:02:56,570
No, you just read.

2383
02:02:56,590 --> 02:02:57,470
I don't like that.

2384
02:02:57,470 --> 02:02:58,610
Actually, just read us.

2385
02:02:58,910 --> 02:02:59,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2386
02:02:59,870 --> 02:03:01,770
It's near the edge of the zone.

2387
02:03:01,950 --> 02:03:02,890
I believe in you.

2388
02:03:02,910 --> 02:03:03,190
Oh, yeah.

2389
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:04,290
No, you're not going to make it.

2390
02:03:04,530 --> 02:03:05,570
You're not going to make it.

2391
02:03:05,870 --> 02:03:08,550
There's no one right over here south of you.

2392
02:03:09,290 --> 02:03:09,670
You know what?

2393
02:03:09,770 --> 02:03:09,990
Do it.

2394
02:03:09,990 --> 02:03:11,130
Just give it a shot, shall we?

2395
02:03:11,410 --> 02:03:11,790
Do it.

2396
02:03:12,870 --> 02:03:13,570
You know what?

2397
02:03:13,590 --> 02:03:14,350
I'm an Australian.

2398
02:03:14,510 --> 02:03:15,590
I live with the bushfire.

2399
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:16,270
Exactly.

2400
02:03:16,950 --> 02:03:18,030
You live with the bushfire.

2401
02:03:18,230 --> 02:03:19,170
You're so used to it.

2402
02:03:19,290 --> 02:03:22,130
Yeah, this is just like it's another Saturday morning for
me, you know?

2403
02:03:22,330 --> 02:03:22,610
Yeah.

2404
02:03:22,990 --> 02:03:23,250
No.

2405
02:03:24,610 --> 02:03:25,270
I believe.

2406
02:03:26,250 --> 02:03:27,870
It's another Saturday morning.

2407
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:29,290
And I'm American.

2408
02:03:29,490 --> 02:03:30,210
I got shot a lot.

2409
02:03:31,550 --> 02:03:31,850
Oh.

2410
02:03:32,070 --> 02:03:32,750
You're so fine.

2411
02:03:33,330 --> 02:03:33,430
Oh.

Don't burn.

Don't worry.

2416
02:03:39,990 --> 02:03:41,790

02:05:16,430 --> 02:05:21,010
Oh, he didn't accept my friend request.

2440
02:05:21,130 --> 02:05:21,930
What do we...

2441
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:22,230
Instant denial?

2442
02:05:22,990 --> 02:05:24,070
No, the other guy.

2443
02:05:24,250 --> 02:05:25,170
I'm going to add this guy.

2444
02:05:26,070 --> 02:05:26,950

Quick message.

I believe in us.

2457
02:05:58,030 --> 02:05:58,970
Axel, you want a game yet?

2458
02:06:00,090 --> 02:06:00,370
Huh?

2459
02:06:00,750 --> 02:06:01,590
Have you won a game yet?

2460
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:03,390
Me?

2461
02:06:03,610 --> 02:06:03,870
No?

2462
02:06:04,710 --> 02:06:05,350
Okay.

2463
02:06:05,950 --> 02:06:06,870
I believe you.

2464
02:06:06,870 --> 02:06:09,750
Okay, I'm playing half the time drunk, okay?

2465
02:06:10,190 --> 02:06:11,070
Leave me alone.

2466
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:13,630
Are you drunk right now?

2467
02:06:14,230 --> 02:06:15,770
No, I'm asleep.

2468
02:06:15,890 --> 02:06:17,050
I'll give you that.

2469
02:06:17,050 --> 02:06:17,270
Oh, that's true.

2470
02:06:17,450 --> 02:06:17,650
That's true.

2471
02:06:17,910 --> 02:06:19,010
I mean, that's the same thing.

2472
02:06:19,790 --> 02:06:21,050
Hey, leave me alone.

2473
02:06:21,250 --> 02:06:22,450
You know, I'm just a guy.

2474
02:06:22,610 --> 02:06:25,770
I'm just like one of those dads who came back from the nine
to five job.

2475
02:06:25,930 --> 02:06:27,430
And then I just want to enjoy my game.

2476
02:06:27,590 --> 02:06:28,850
And I'm getting, you know, I'm fighting.

2477
02:06:29,510 --> 02:06:33,210
Yeah, I'm just getting no life is relentlessly bullied by
your teammates.

2478
02:06:33,970 --> 02:06:34,430
I don't know.

2479
02:06:35,610 --> 02:06:36,670
How could they do this?

2480
02:06:37,310 --> 02:06:37,710
Unbelievable.

2481
02:06:38,890 --> 02:06:39,110
All right.

2482
02:06:39,190 --> 02:06:40,330
We have ASAP Jojo.

2483
02:06:40,790 --> 02:06:41,690
I believe in him.

2484
02:06:41,850 --> 02:06:42,610
He's level 55.

2485
02:06:42,730 --> 02:06:44,010
So he's been playing since launch.

2486
02:06:45,170 --> 02:06:45,530
Wow.

2487
02:06:45,530 --> 02:06:47,050
ASAP Jojo.

2488
02:06:47,550 --> 02:06:51,690
Yeah, Father 3 returns home from work just to get shit on by
ASAP Jojo.

2489
02:06:53,910 --> 02:06:55,350
Why is he called ASAP Jojo?

2490
02:06:55,630 --> 02:06:57,790
Maybe he likes Powerpuff Girls.

2491
02:06:58,650 --> 02:06:59,290
Maybe he's a rapper.

2492
02:06:59,750 --> 02:07:00,670
Yeah, oh yeah, that's true.

2493
02:07:00,770 --> 02:07:02,390
He has a dollar sign on his name.

2494
02:07:03,410 --> 02:07:04,970
That's Pete Rapper.

2495
02:07:06,290 --> 02:07:06,990
Axel's a rapper.

2496
02:07:07,610 --> 02:07:08,090
Really are?

2497
02:07:08,170 --> 02:07:08,630
You are?

2498
02:07:09,030 --> 02:07:09,550
Yo, rappers.

2499
02:07:09,570 --> 02:07:11,910
Axel, they call me Eminem.

2500
02:07:12,390 --> 02:07:13,690
Yeah, do you give us an Eminem song?

2501
02:07:14,410 --> 02:07:15,150
Nobody calls you Eminem.

2502
02:07:15,530 --> 02:07:16,250
a freestyle.

2503
02:07:17,110 --> 02:07:18,830
No, I don't do freestyles, you know?

2504
02:07:18,990 --> 02:07:20,710
No, no freestyles from me.

2505
02:07:20,870 --> 02:07:23,570
Ooh, I do what you do?

2506
02:07:23,710 --> 02:07:25,710
I can't tell you what it feels like.

2507
02:07:25,890 --> 02:07:30,590
I can only tell you what really is I said axle, not out
there.

2508
02:07:31,030 --> 02:07:32,790
Oh, rapper, but like, see?

2509
02:07:33,450 --> 02:07:37,110
That's like asking a millionaire, hey, show me the million
dollars you got.

2510
02:07:37,390 --> 02:07:38,370
Millionaires don't do that.

2511
02:07:38,570 --> 02:07:39,490
That's why they're millionaires.

2512
02:07:39,690 --> 02:07:40,910
You don't have to show.

2513
02:07:41,010 --> 02:07:45,390
They can just they show by their clothes and their cars.

2514
02:07:46,430 --> 02:07:48,230
Where's your clothes and cars?

2515
02:07:49,330 --> 02:07:49,850
Well, I'm a rapper.

2516
02:07:50,190 --> 02:07:51,150
Where's your rhymes and skim?

2517
02:07:51,210 --> 02:07:52,090
Yeah, where's your rhyme?

2518
02:07:53,930 --> 02:07:58,470
Oh, potatoes, tomatoes, the hose, the...

2519
02:07:58,470 --> 02:07:59,090
The what?

2520
02:07:59,590 --> 02:08:00,410
Let's go downtown.

2521
02:08:02,030 --> 02:08:04,390
Come on, Jojo, take us to downtown.

2522
02:08:05,110 --> 02:08:05,950
No, that's fine.

2523
02:08:06,530 --> 02:08:07,370
You can take us to...

2524
02:08:07,370 --> 02:08:08,270
Oh, no, he...

2525
02:08:08,270 --> 02:08:09,690
Oh, where is he taking us?

2526
02:08:09,850 --> 02:08:10,670
I don't know.

2527
02:08:11,070 --> 02:08:11,610
I don't know.

2528
02:08:12,390 --> 02:08:13,410
Where is he taking us?

2529
02:08:14,690 --> 02:08:15,510

Thank you Lisa Oh, no, oh I bled it's okay.

2630
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:37,240
I have second chance We all have second chance, I think so
apparently it's like a police officer if you ask they have

2631
02:13:37,240 --> 02:13:38,760
to disclose But they don't have to tell you.

2632
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:39,980
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

2633
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:46,500
They don't have to tell you police officer So they can omit
information about murders in the home Because they're trying

2634
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:47,340
to sell at home.

2635
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:48,860
Why the fuck would they tell you?

2636
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:53,680
Like, there's no reason.

2637
02:13:53,780 --> 02:13:53,940
It's okay.

2638
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:56,160
I don't think I'll ever own a home, so we'll see.

2639
02:13:56,180 --> 02:13:57,080
Are you kidding me?

2640
02:13:57,200 --> 02:13:58,240
What is up with people?

2641
02:13:58,620 --> 02:14:04,540
Yeah, but maybe the apartment you're in right now is a
murder home.

2642
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:06,700
You don't know that.

2643

02:27:57,460 --> 02:27:57,720

Fuck.

2882
02:28:02,600 --> 02:28:03,880
This guy's butt cheeks.

2883
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:05,260
It was mine.

2884
02:28:07,680 --> 02:28:08,900
I got him.

2885
02:28:09,580 --> 02:28:12,480
My gun might be butt cheeks, but I still got you.

2886
02:28:12,500 --> 02:28:12,740
Boy.

2887
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:14,020
Mr. butt cheeks.

2888
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:16,260
Whoa!

2889
02:28:19,380 --> 02:28:20,700
I don't know where his teammates are.

2890
02:28:21,160 --> 02:28:21,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2891
02:28:23,480 --> 02:28:25,980
Oh, there's some stuff here.

2892
02:28:27,540 --> 02:28:28,780
Where are his teammates, though?

2893
02:28:29,640 --> 02:28:30,200
Right here, people?

2894
02:28:31,960 --> 02:28:34,360
He's probably resting, so maybe just one around us.

2895
02:28:34,700 --> 02:28:35,100
Yeah.

2896
02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:36,500
I don't know where he is.

2897
02:28:37,880 --> 02:28:39,620
I'm checking this out.

2898
02:28:39,820 --> 02:28:41,060
Is there any good shit here, girl?

2899
02:28:42,140 --> 02:28:43,020
Where do we go?

2900
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:47,420
Oh, definitely not towards the fire.

2901
02:28:48,360 --> 02:28:48,980
Let's go northeast.

2902
02:28:49,540 --> 02:28:49,580
Northeast?

2903
02:28:52,660 --> 02:28:53,100
All right.

2904
02:28:54,380 --> 02:28:55,760
I'm following Altair.

2905
02:28:55,960 --> 02:28:58,620
If we die is because of him, he has a bad leadership.

2906
02:28:59,500 --> 02:28:59,800
Woohoo!

2907
02:28:59,980 --> 02:29:00,800
I'm a bad leader.

2908
02:29:06,770 --> 02:29:07,710
Follow me, guys.

2909
02:29:07,830 --> 02:29:08,410
We're gonna die.

2910
02:29:09,330 --> 02:29:09,830
Yippee!

2911
02:29:10,630 --> 02:29:11,130
Yippee!

2912
02:29:12,150 --> 02:29:13,910
Oh, okay.

2913
02:29:14,750 --> 02:29:15,590
That's scary.

2914
02:29:16,910 --> 02:29:18,550
We're gonna go towards combat training, actually.

2915
02:29:18,930 --> 02:29:20,130
I feel like, should we loot here?

2916
02:29:21,410 --> 02:29:21,650
Oh, sure.

2917
02:29:22,390 --> 02:29:23,550
I'm getting my knife out.

2918
02:29:24,330 --> 02:29:25,310
I'm shaking the wall.

2919
02:29:27,510 --> 02:29:29,470
Wall has been successfully...

2920
02:29:29,470 --> 02:29:30,490
Oh, they looted this area.

2921
02:29:30,950 --> 02:29:32,870
This area has nothing.

2922
02:29:32,890 --> 02:29:34,450
Leader, you have a guild of six to lead.

2923
02:29:34,670 --> 02:29:35,970
Yeah, but we could always have more.

2924
02:29:36,770 --> 02:29:37,970
Yeah, there's nothing here, though.

2925
02:29:38,630 --> 02:29:39,550
Oh, you fuck.

2926
02:29:39,970 --> 02:29:40,630
Are you guys okay?

2927
02:29:41,070 --> 02:29:42,130
Wait, wait, where are you getting shot at?

2928
02:29:44,790 --> 02:29:46,150
I'm about to die, yo.

2929
02:29:47,150 --> 02:29:48,370
Where did you get shot at?

2930
02:29:48,950 --> 02:29:49,410
Oh, this?

2931
02:29:49,470 --> 02:29:50,070
I have no idea.

2932
02:29:50,970 --> 02:29:51,330
Helicopter.

2933
02:29:53,650 --> 02:29:53,790
Okay.

2934
02:29:57,150 --> 02:29:58,170
Wait, where are you?

2935
02:29:58,410 --> 02:29:58,810
Up the hill.

2936
02:29:58,850 --> 02:29:59,350
Up the hill west.

2937
02:29:59,550 --> 02:29:59,890
Hill west.

2938
02:30:00,050 --> 02:30:01,550
West, west, west, west.

2939
02:30:01,730 --> 02:30:01,750
Okay.

2940
02:30:05,950 --> 02:30:07,250
I'm looking at the hill.

2941
02:30:07,850 --> 02:30:08,610
This guy just creeps.

2942
02:30:08,630 --> 02:30:21,130

line now you ain't punished just know that everybody has a

2945
02:30:38,290 --> 02:30:44,470

2950
02:31:13,490 --> 02:31:14,110
Don't blow up your friend's legs.

2951
02:31:14,110 --> 02:31:15,070
Let's stop playing this game.

2952
02:31:15,170 --> 02:31:15,810
This game's boring.

2953
02:31:16,510 --> 02:31:16,550
Yeah.

2954
02:31:16,550 --> 02:31:16,610
Yeah.

2955
02:31:16,790 --> 02:31:19,450
What's the point if you can't blow up your friend's legs?

2956
02:31:19,810 --> 02:31:20,650
Like, what the fuck?

2957
02:31:21,490 --> 02:31:22,610
That's what life is all about.

2958
02:31:22,670 --> 02:31:23,110
I know.

2959
02:31:23,570 --> 02:31:25,670
It's about killing your friends and taking away their limbs.

2960
02:31:25,990 --> 02:31:26,110
Exactly.

2961
02:31:26,110 --> 02:31:27,350
I should get your butt cheeks over here.

2962
02:31:27,550 --> 02:31:27,890
Hurry up.

2963
02:31:28,830 --> 02:31:29,230
Exactly.

2964
02:31:32,330 --> 02:31:33,470
It's gonna be a while.

2965
02:31:33,570 --> 02:31:34,710
There's still 16 more.

2966
02:31:36,250 --> 02:31:37,730
Should we stay in like the hills?

2967
02:31:38,710 --> 02:31:39,310
Oh, no.

2968
02:31:41,250 --> 02:31:44,230
We gotta find better loot, that's for sure.

2969
02:31:44,910 --> 02:31:47,210
I think someone just parachuted behind us south.

2970
02:31:47,350 --> 02:31:47,830
Wait, really?

2971
02:31:48,590 --> 02:31:49,510
Yeah, Winfred is...

2972
02:31:49,510 --> 02:31:50,430
I saw a parachute cut off.

2973
02:31:51,210 --> 02:31:51,550
There he is.

2974
02:31:51,810 --> 02:31:52,390
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2975
02:31:52,570 --> 02:31:54,050
He's peeing someone over there.

2976
02:31:54,570 --> 02:31:55,350
Careful, Axel.

2977
02:31:57,050 --> 02:31:58,690
They're shooting at us.

2978
02:32:01,790 --> 02:32:05,470
I don't know which one was my long scope, but...

2979
02:32:05,470 --> 02:32:07,790
Look at how they're hitting everything, hey.

2980
02:32:08,450 --> 02:32:08,970
Hey!

2981
02:32:09,410 --> 02:32:10,530

We're relaxed.

2997
02:33:33,990 --> 02:33:34,850

02:33:36,410 --> 02:33:37,810
I didn't want to chill anyway.

3000
02:33:37,930 --> 02:33:38,610
I didn't want to chill.

02:35:35,820 --> 02:35:37,280
It's scary outside.

3040
02:35:37,940 --> 02:35:39,340

3041
02:35:40,440 --> 02:35:41,260
Bro, Altair!

They're all gonna fucking come for us!

3043
02:35:43,160 --> 02:35:44,700
Oh, wait, yeah, I'm thinking shields, though.

3044
02:35:46,540 --> 02:35:48,420
I think it's a glitch to shield.

3045
02:35:48,580 --> 02:35:49,480
I can't pick it up.

3046
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:50,680
Oh, no.

3047
02:35:51,560 --> 02:35:52,000
Oh.

02:35:52,760 --> 02:35:53,560
It's okay.

3049
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:56,600
I think we're very, very safe.

3050
02:35:58,040 --> 02:36:00,480
You and I, we're like, we're like slimes right now.

3051
02:36:00,580 --> 02:36:01,860
We're just like slugs.

3052
02:36:02,420 --> 02:36:02,880
Don't worry.

3053
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:04,720

3054
02:36:04,800 --> 02:36:05,580
What's my four?

3055
02:36:06,220 --> 02:36:09,360
I have something on my four, but I don't know what it is.

3056
02:36:09,440 --> 02:36:10,440
Guys, what's my four?

3057
02:36:10,940 --> 02:36:11,760

What is four?

3059
02:36:13,560 --> 02:36:14,500
It's your ability.

3060
02:36:14,880 --> 02:36:15,700
What's my ability?

3061
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:17,040
I don't know.

3062
02:36:17,860 --> 02:36:18,800
I don't fucking know.

3063
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:19,840
You think I know what?

3064
02:36:19,860 --> 02:36:20,140
Oh shit.

3065
02:36:20,420 --> 02:36:23,360
I just lost consciousness there for like 10 seconds.

3066
02:36:23,660 --> 02:36:24,260
Holy shit.

3067
02:36:24,660 --> 02:36:25,300

Oh yeah.

3070
02:36:30,180 --> 02:36:32,920
I might have to call this as the last one maybe.

3071
02:36:33,820 --> 02:36:34,000
Shit.

3072
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:36,420
My consciousness is flying right now.

3073
02:36:36,800 --> 02:36:37,160
Don't worry.

3074
02:36:37,220 --> 02:36:38,120
Don't worry Axel.

3075
02:36:38,320 --> 02:36:39,080
We will get you.

3076
02:36:39,240 --> 02:36:40,080
We will get you.

3077
02:36:40,540 --> 02:36:42,180
Oh my god.

3078
02:36:42,260 --> 02:36:42,880

3079
02:36:43,160 --> 02:36:43,960
I was there!

3080
02:36:44,060 --> 02:36:45,860

3081
02:36:45,860 --> 02:36:46,840

3082
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:49,180

3089
02:36:57,620 --> 02:36:58,220

02:36:58,760 --> 02:37:00,320

I was using my...

3119
02:38:05,020 --> 02:38:09,000
I was playing my character bullet and using my ears to play.

3120
02:38:09,940 --> 02:38:11,980

Guys, for legal reasons, that is a joke.

3132
02:39:03,080 --> 02:39:05,620
Do not mix alcohol and caffeine together.

02:40:26,300 --> 02:40:27,420
Let's go here.

3153
02:40:30,300 --> 02:40:31,520
Who's the fourth in their squad?

3154
02:40:31,700 --> 02:40:32,080
I don't know.

3155
02:40:32,140 --> 02:40:34,840
He was level 200, and we adopted him.

3156
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:36,500
Well, you don't know Winfield VTuber?

3157
02:40:36,740 --> 02:40:37,400
Oh, shit, you're right.

3158
02:40:37,460 --> 02:40:38,940
No, Winfield, the pro gamer.

3159
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:42,200
This guy has...

3160
02:40:42,220 --> 02:40:43,100
It's basically...

3161
02:40:43,100 --> 02:40:43,780
He's part of VSM.

3162
02:40:44,260 --> 02:40:45,760
Yeah, you know, like the...

3163
02:40:45,760 --> 02:40:47,420
The I can solo her guy?

3164
02:40:47,800 --> 02:40:48,500
That's basically him.

3165
02:40:48,500 --> 02:40:48,960
Team team team.

3166
02:40:49,540 --> 02:40:50,120
Oh, shit.

3167
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:52,700
It's not him, but he's like...

3168
02:40:52,700 --> 02:40:54,300
He's like that guy, but for...

3169
02:40:54,300 --> 02:40:55,120
For battlefield.

3170
02:40:57,680 --> 02:40:59,060
I got one guy.

3171
02:40:59,660 --> 02:41:01,040
With my T-Fog.

3172
02:41:02,360 --> 02:41:03,400
T-Fog.

3173
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:04,440
The guy with my pistol.

3174
02:41:06,480 --> 02:41:07,300
Good job, Winfield.

3175
02:41:07,680 --> 02:41:08,120
Winston.

3176
02:41:08,540 --> 02:41:09,060
Winfieldston.

3177
02:41:09,480 --> 02:41:10,160
Good job, bro.

3178
02:41:10,300 --> 02:41:10,760
Nice.

3179
02:41:13,560 --> 02:41:15,580
See, Axel, this is what a real veteran would do.

3180
02:41:15,900 --> 02:41:15,920
Yeah.

3181
02:41:16,820 --> 02:41:17,480
You would know.

3182
02:41:17,720 --> 02:41:18,800
He almost became a veteran.

3183
02:41:20,140 --> 02:41:22,840
Yeah, but in the name of the law.

3184
02:41:24,120 --> 02:41:26,480
It's not murder when you're doing it for their country.

3185
02:41:27,360 --> 02:41:28,640
It's not murder if you're doing it for content.

3186
02:41:29,100 --> 02:41:29,520
That's true.

3187
02:41:29,660 --> 02:41:30,180
That too.

3188
02:41:31,400 --> 02:41:32,840
You're protecting everyone.

3189
02:41:34,480 --> 02:41:37,160
Guys, there's a lot of people here, and I only have my
pistol.

3190
02:41:37,560 --> 02:41:37,880
What the fuck?

3191
02:41:38,340 --> 02:41:41,600
No audio, cool, battlefield, Apex Legends 2?

3192
02:41:42,220 --> 02:41:42,840
Oh, no.

3193
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:43,940
Okay.

3194
02:41:43,940 --> 02:41:45,460
Guys, I still have my pistol.

3195
02:41:45,660 --> 02:41:46,960
Stick game, guys.

3196
02:41:47,900 --> 02:41:48,500
Winfield's dead.

3197
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:49,460
Axel's dead.

3198
02:41:49,640 --> 02:41:50,000
Give me a second.

3199
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:51,760
Um.

3200
02:41:53,860 --> 02:41:56,140
I still have my pistol against someone.

3201

Survival of the fittest, bro.

Gunshots northeast.

Just make him play Russian roulette, you know, and then you
get the whole neighborhood.

3251
02:46:38,800 --> 02:46:39,800
You worry about me being a parent.

about survival of the fittest.

3258
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:00,260
Right.

The sibling that's the most fittest survive.

02:47:03,880 --> 02:47:05,480
And if they don't, the mom eats the child.

3261
02:47:05,500 --> 02:47:05,920
Just eat them in the womb.

3262

Don't worry, Axel.

3276
02:48:14,520 --> 02:48:16,760
There's still 21 more teams left.

3277
02:48:17,060 --> 02:48:17,180
Don't worry.

3278
02:48:17,320 --> 02:48:17,800
You're five.

3279
02:48:18,500 --> 02:48:20,560
It's just 21 more teams.

3280
02:48:21,240 --> 02:48:21,840
Oh, 69.

3281
02:48:22,220 --> 02:48:22,500

02:48:23,580 --> 02:48:25,320
There's 69 players left.

3284
02:48:26,420 --> 02:48:28,160
Oh, people are dying so slow.

3285
02:48:30,220 --> 02:48:30,720
Oh, never mind.

3286
02:48:30,860 --> 02:48:31,260
67.

3287
02:48:31,820 --> 02:48:33,400
Haha, it's like seven.

3288
02:48:36,620 --> 02:48:37,900
Curse you, Doki Bird!

3289
02:48:38,440 --> 02:48:40,100
I'm trying to, I'm testing guns out.

3290
02:48:40,540 --> 02:48:42,660
Okay, we'll grab this.

3291
02:48:42,840 --> 02:48:42,980
Oops.

3292
02:48:46,500 --> 02:48:47,260
The two.

3293
02:48:48,400 --> 02:48:49,180
Wow, two are straight.

3294
02:48:50,500 --> 02:48:51,920
I'm just testing the gun out.

3295
02:48:53,120 --> 02:48:54,080
Oh, I know what gun I have.

3296
02:48:54,080 --> 02:48:54,820
I need to do some scouting.

3297
02:48:55,560 --> 02:48:56,020
Top 20!

3298
02:48:56,620 --> 02:48:57,020
Yay!

3299
02:48:58,260 --> 02:48:59,500
I thought it started with 20.

3300
02:49:00,400 --> 02:49:00,640
No.

3301
02:49:01,260 --> 02:49:02,100
It's like 21.

3302
02:49:06,400 --> 02:49:06,880
Wait.

3303
02:49:07,520 --> 02:49:07,860
Let's see.

3304
02:49:07,860 --> 02:49:08,920
You're so far ahead.

3305
02:49:09,780 --> 02:49:10,300
You're just getting.

3306
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:11,500
Oh, okay.

3307
02:49:13,940 --> 02:49:14,960
We got this.

3308
02:49:16,480 --> 02:49:18,260
Still at 67, guys.

3309
02:49:18,900 --> 02:49:20,620
They know what they want.

3310
02:49:23,820 --> 02:49:25,300
They want to cringe and die.

3311
02:49:25,560 --> 02:49:25,880
Whoa.

3312
02:49:26,300 --> 02:49:26,700
Wait, what?

3313
02:49:26,720 --> 02:49:27,320
Where are you going to try to?

3314
02:49:29,600 --> 02:49:30,480
Oh, fuck.

3315
02:49:32,140 --> 02:49:32,900
Oh, my.

3316
02:49:32,920 --> 02:49:34,000
Oh, shit.

3317
02:49:34,360 --> 02:49:35,160
Oh, my God.

3318
02:49:36,520 --> 02:49:43,240
You know, up there, you didn't tell me where you got shot
at.

3319
02:49:43,820 --> 02:49:44,740
Well that's the point of the scout.

3320
02:49:44,880 --> 02:49:45,800
I get shot first.

3321
02:49:46,700 --> 02:49:47,800
I was next.

3322
02:49:48,220 --> 02:49:48,940
Oh, no.

3323
02:49:49,600 --> 02:49:50,240
No.

3324
02:49:51,080 --> 02:49:51,500
No.

3325
02:49:52,520 --> 02:49:52,940
No.

3326
02:49:54,060 --> 02:49:54,100
No.

3327
02:49:54,100 --> 02:49:54,400
No.

3328
02:49:54,400 --> 02:49:54,500
No.

3329
02:49:54,500 --> 02:49:54,820
No.

3330
02:49:54,820 --> 02:49:54,940
No.

3331
02:49:54,940 --> 02:49:55,160
No.

3332
02:49:55,340 --> 02:49:55,480
No.

3333
02:50:03,340 --> 02:50:05,760
I have something to do in 40 minutes.

3334
02:50:05,760 --> 02:50:06,360
No, you do.

3335
02:50:06,400 --> 02:50:07,040
No, you gotta play.

3336
02:50:07,260 --> 02:50:07,960
You gotta play another one.

3337
02:50:08,420 --> 02:50:10,460
And then Axel, Axel.

3338
02:50:10,740 --> 02:50:11,120
No, you too.

3339
02:50:11,400 --> 02:50:12,120
We enjoyed the game.

3340
02:50:12,840 --> 02:50:13,360
Axel, come on.

3341
02:50:14,460 --> 02:50:16,320
Axel, probably gonna end with if you leave though.

3342
02:50:16,340 --> 02:50:17,640
You can stay here for 40 minutes anyway.

3343
02:50:17,880 --> 02:50:18,160
You know?

3344
02:50:19,680 --> 02:50:20,540
Yeah, Axel.

3345
02:50:21,220 --> 02:50:22,180
Axel, we got in the game.

3346
02:50:22,980 --> 02:50:24,360
Axel, we got in the game.

3347
02:50:24,920 --> 02:50:25,060
Axel, we got in the game.

3348
02:50:25,060 --> 02:50:26,440
No, no, no, no, no.

3349
02:50:26,580 --> 02:50:27,620
Axel, you can't leave.

3350
02:50:27,820 --> 02:50:29,060
We got in the game though.

3351
02:50:29,500 --> 02:50:31,300
Axel, you can't leave me here alone with Doki.

3352
02:50:31,460 --> 02:50:32,040
She's gonna...

3353
02:50:32,040 --> 02:50:32,900
Wait, what the fuck?

3354
02:50:32,920 --> 02:50:34,440
No, no, wait, wait.

3355
02:50:34,660 --> 02:50:35,320
That's fake news.

3356
02:50:37,100 --> 02:50:40,200
You fell down those stairs yourself, buddy.

3357
02:50:43,060 --> 02:50:46,040
Axel, we can't end on a loss, bro.

3358
02:50:47,340 --> 02:50:47,860
Oh, yeah.

3359
02:50:48,020 --> 02:50:50,620
We've only been doing on a lot.

3360
02:50:51,300 --> 02:50:51,740
No, no, no, no.

3361
02:50:51,900 --> 02:50:52,500
We got six plays.

3362
02:50:52,660 --> 02:50:53,080
That's pretty good.

3363
02:50:53,140 --> 02:50:53,980
Yeah, we got top six.

3364
02:50:54,400 --> 02:50:55,040
Look, look.

3365
02:50:55,540 --> 02:50:57,240
Axel, Axel, Axel.

3366
02:50:57,820 --> 02:50:58,340
One more.

3367
02:50:58,440 --> 02:50:59,400
Last one, for real.

3368
02:50:59,640 --> 02:50:59,960
For real.

3369
02:51:00,240 --> 02:51:00,900
Yeah, see.

3370
02:51:01,160 --> 02:51:02,100
Win first set, we can win.

3371
02:51:02,260 --> 02:51:02,900
Win first, go lock.

3372
02:51:02,920 --> 02:51:06,160
Axel Look, look, Winfield said where you can- He's gonna
lock in now.

3373
02:51:06,200 --> 02:51:06,940
He's gonna lock in.

3374
02:51:07,080 --> 02:51:09,140
Axel, if you play one more, I'll open a case in
Counter-Strike.

3375
02:51:09,320 --> 02:51:10,420
Yeah, yeah, I'll buy a case.

3376
02:51:12,860 --> 02:51:12,900

I'll buy- Don't you'll buy a case too.

3378

I'll buy a case and unlock it.

3379
02:51:16,800 --> 02:51:18,860
And then I'll buy you a case too, Axel.

3380
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:20,440
I'll buy you a case.

3381
02:51:20,960 --> 02:51:22,780
She's gonna buy you a case for free real estate.

3382
02:51:22,940 --> 02:51:24,000
Bro, it's free real estate.

3383
02:51:24,020 --> 02:51:24,700

3385
02:51:26,580 --> 02:51:30,000
The only time I do not late, chapter is in- Okay, okay, go,

3386
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:30,580
He left the lobby.

3387
02:51:30,820 --> 02:51:31,300
You already left the lobby.

3388
02:51:31,600 --> 02:51:32,540
Wait, he left the lobby!

3389
02:51:32,920 --> 02:51:36,920

02:51:37,640 --> 02:51:38,560
Oh, Axel.

3391
02:51:39,280 --> 02:51:39,660
Come on, bro.

3392
02:51:39,800 --> 02:51:41,040
LeBron would never have done a loss.

3393
02:51:41,240 --> 02:51:43,180
He would switch teams after that lows.

3394
02:51:45,860 --> 02:51:46,420
Axel.

3395
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:47,740

What if we win right now?

3398
02:51:50,720 --> 02:51:54,040
What if we win right now without you, Axel?

3399
02:51:54,260 --> 02:51:55,780
Then you would regret it all.

3400
02:51:56,820 --> 02:51:57,780
No, no, I won't.

3401
02:51:57,840 --> 02:51:59,380

It's okay.

3441
02:54:04,330 --> 02:54:06,530
We can't even get the players to this lobby though.

3442
02:54:06,790 --> 02:54:07,110
Where's when?

3443
02:54:07,610 --> 02:54:08,590
Where's Winfried?

3444
02:54:08,950 --> 02:54:10,130
Where did he go?

3445
02:54:10,430 --> 02:54:11,310
He left too?

3446
02:54:12,350 --> 02:54:13,090
It's just me.

3447
02:54:14,110 --> 02:54:14,550
Oh.

3448
02:54:16,150 --> 02:54:18,170
And Chad, look, you know what?

3449
02:54:18,230 --> 02:54:19,430
Maybe this is a good place to end.

3450
02:54:20,010 --> 02:54:21,110
I think Axel is right.

3451
02:54:23,570 --> 02:54:33,590
I told you guys the God, I could hear his voice maybe i'm
like ascending too high i'm flying too close to the sun it

3452
02:54:33,590 --> 02:54:42,530
is 1 a.m i should probably everyone's games crashed during
that queue so i think i think that was a sign it's a sign

3453
02:54:42,530 --> 02:54:54,230
see i can hear god whispering mees right now you're gonna
die soon you're gonna die soon be it he's telling me he's

3454
02:54:54,230 --> 02:55:05,450
just like freedom he doesn't deserve to suffer anymore yeah
let him go thank god god commands you to play one more i'm

3455
02:55:05,450 --> 02:55:15,070
an atheist so i don't believe in god okay how about how
about this how about this maybe in in return maybe we'll

3456
02:55:15,070 --> 02:55:21,230
have to schedule another stream at some other point yeah
we'll have another battlefield do some We should do

3457
02:55:21,230 --> 02:55:24,250
endurance stream for battlefield until we win one game.

3458
02:55:24,250 --> 02:55:25,230
Oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, no.

3459
02:55:25,230 --> 02:55:25,830
We got to do the Axel.

Come on.

3461
02:55:26,410 --> 02:55:27,030
Come on, Axel.

3462
02:55:27,110 --> 02:55:28,830
And then Tyre endurance stream.

3463
02:55:29,630 --> 02:55:30,250
Axel, come on.

3464
02:55:30,330 --> 02:55:31,330
Do you believe in us?

3465
02:55:32,410 --> 02:55:33,570
Guys, we're going to die.

3466
02:55:33,750 --> 02:55:34,870
We're going to die from it.

3467
02:55:34,930 --> 02:55:35,090
All right.

3468
02:55:35,430 --> 02:55:35,570
Okay.

3469
02:55:35,570 --> 02:55:36,970
It's like we get like RPR something.

3470
02:55:37,090 --> 02:55:38,230
So someone to carry us.

3471
02:55:38,410 --> 02:55:39,970
No, we could get Winfried again.

3472
02:55:40,330 --> 02:55:40,670
Yeah.

3473
02:55:40,930 --> 02:55:41,170
Winfried.

3474
02:55:41,590 --> 02:55:41,990
Okay.

3475
02:55:42,110 --> 02:55:42,450
I don't know.

3476
02:55:42,730 --> 02:55:43,170
Winfried didn't match.

3477
02:55:43,170 --> 02:55:46,010
But you guys are telling me you guys want to die from old
age.

3478
02:55:46,370 --> 02:55:47,670
Let's do it next week.

3479
02:55:47,850 --> 02:55:48,430
Let's do that.

3480
02:55:49,290 --> 02:55:50,650
Well, I'll think about.

3481
02:55:50,870 --> 02:55:52,190
think about it.

3482
02:55:52,190 --> 02:55:52,350
Hi, Axel.

3483
02:55:52,550 --> 02:55:53,650
You know, you wanna.

3484
02:55:54,830 --> 02:55:56,410
Enduring stream till we win.

3485
02:55:57,150 --> 02:55:58,530
Enduring stream till we win.

3486
02:55:58,590 --> 02:55:59,650
We're going to be here forever.

3487
02:56:00,730 --> 02:56:03,410
I think actually if we get our PR, he's just going to carry
us.

3488
02:56:04,110 --> 02:56:07,170
I actually think we don't even have to play the game.

3489
02:56:07,290 --> 02:56:07,750
He's just here.

3490
02:56:09,630 --> 02:56:11,710
We shall see what happens.

3491
02:56:12,950 --> 02:56:13,870
Axel, look, it's a free win.

3492
02:56:14,070 --> 02:56:14,190
I'll tell you.

3493
02:56:14,310 --> 02:56:14,670
I'll tell you.

3494
02:56:15,170 --> 02:56:18,630
We will message Axel every day until he says yes.

3495
02:56:19,270 --> 02:56:20,290
Day 1000 of messaging.

3496
02:56:20,870 --> 02:56:21,290

3497
02:56:21,670 --> 02:56:22,310
