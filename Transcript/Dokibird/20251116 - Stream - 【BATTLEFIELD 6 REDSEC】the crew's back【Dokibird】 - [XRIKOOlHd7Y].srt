1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
Oh, that's right.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,040
No, no animation.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,980
No waiting animation.

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:05,620
We out.

5
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,260
We out here.

6
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:06,720
All right.

7
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,560
The hoes are watching.

8
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:08,380
Yeah.

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,440
Altair, what was that catchphrase that you wanted to say after that?

10
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,380
Suck it, nerds.

11
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,100
Oh, no.

12
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,420
He did not say that.

13
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,300
It was not nerds.

14
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,700
It was sucking something, but it wasn't nerds.

15
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,880
Suck it, noobs.

16
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,080
The hoes are watching.

17
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:25,900
All right.

18
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,280
Come on, Altair.

19
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,800
You know you want to say it.

20
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,640
It starts with a P. Pokemon.

21
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,280
Dang, of course he's into that.

22
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:38,940
You guys are trying to get me.

23
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,680
You guys are trying to get all my videos restricted, huh?

24
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,260
No, no, of course not.

25
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,440
Oh, no, we would never do that to you.

26
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,000
Because if your videos get restricted, our videos get restricted too, because we're streaming with you.

27
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,980
Hey, mine gets restricted anyways.

28
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,700
It don't really matter.

29
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,580
Oh, that's true.

30
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:53,900
That's true.

31
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,240
I got my Garfield video restricted because I sang a very inappropriate song.

32
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,580
I sang a very inappropriate song as Garfield.

33
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,740
Garfield's thing's inappropriate songs?

34
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,260
Yeah, it was, yeah.

35
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,480
I thought inappropriate songs only existed like Rick and Morty and South Park and shit for you.

36
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,440
Like, you know, I said I was rapping a very inappropriate song.

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,000
What was it about?

38
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,060
Give us a context.

39
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,280
Why was it so inappropriate?

40
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,520
It was like, you know, Lonely Island.

41
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,500
You know, Lonely Island.

42
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,660
No, I just touched.

43
00:01:30,700 --> 00:02:01,240
oh and it felt so good that was so good yeah so it was from the lonely item it was very inappropriate and i did it as garfield i mean come on that's a classic though no no it wasn't that it was a lot worse it was a lot worse oh okay so you didn't go with the classic you went with like an og yeah yeah yeah an og son from snl hey guys hello everybody welcome to battlefield Redseg.

44
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,680
So the only person with the most experience is Axel.

45
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,660
He's also going to be the one with the most pain.

46
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,200
No, no, no, no.

47
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,500
I am not experienced at all.

48
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,860
The one with the most experience and it's going to carry both Altair and I will be Axel.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,020
Axel, I expect high things from you, buddy.

50
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,980
Yeah, I expect so much from you, Axel.

51
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,260
Nah, I'm going to be browsing Twitter, dude.

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,600
You all do you love me.

53
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,060
You were the one that you like.

54
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,120
I love battlefield.

55
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,600
I love Redseg.

56
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,700
Whoa, I never said that.

57
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,200
Come on, man.

58
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,980
I didn't say that.

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,820
I was so excited to play Red Sacky.

60
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,380
That's what you said.

61
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,620
No, I said I didn't sleep because I had shit going on.

62
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:36,920
No, no.

63
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,740
You were like, I love Red Sack.

64
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,220
And you were like, yesterday I was playing Red Sack.

65
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,640
Yeah, yeah, you're like, I was playing Red Sack yesterday too.

66
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,760
And we're like, whoa, really?

67
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,300
Yeah, I was playing a bit.

68
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,500
I was playing a bit.

69
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,100
But that doesn't mean I'm good, you know.

70
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,520
But hey, at least my PC runs smoothly this time.

71
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,020
You know, that's one good thing.

72
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,320
Yeah, that's good.

73
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,080
It always had me, yo.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:33,920

75
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,760
Or a pyromaniac.

76
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,440
Or a pyro.

77
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,560
That's not a doctor.

78
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,560
That's not...

79
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,340
That's a big deal.

80
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:39,940
Close enough.

81
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,980
Close enough.

82
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,100
So, one fucking...

83
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,100
One saves lives.

84
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,760
The other take lives.

85
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,700
I mean, technically, the doctor can do both if you want to, but...

86
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,000
Nah, nah, it's designed to take your life.

87
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,720
You know why?

88
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,500
So they can keep...

89
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,940
They keep stealing your money.

90
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,440
You know they all have that cure in their basement.

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:25,600
so you can make more money off of them you just don't cure them fully so you cure them 90 yeah if you cure them 90 broken no they'll like keep coming back if you kill every time yeah yeah every time i just fly back to osiland or fly over to japan i always just pray i just hope that there is no cancer research doctor on my plane you know what i'm saying i'm i'm always like them I'm just like,

92
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,760
I pray the Lord.

93
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,420
Please, no researchers on my plane.

94
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,020
Wait, why?

95
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,200
Why not on your plane?

96
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,720
I mean, you're still here.

97
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,020
Hey, they don't get me if I talk too much.

98
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, they got him.

99
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,380
See, the hoses are watching.

100
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,580
Like I said in the beginning.

101
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,080
The hoses are watching, bro.

102
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,540
All right, party.

103
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,360
Axel, as a doctor.

104
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,280
Join party.

105
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,560
Have you taken the Hippocratic Oath, or are you just a hypocrite?

106
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,980
I don't think he's like...

107
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,240
What the hell is that?

108
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,060
I don't think he's a server.

109
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,000
definitely has not taken the Hippocratic Oath.

110
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,140
Oh no.

111
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,160
I don't know what a Hippocrate is.

112
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,680
He really is a doctor that can kill.

113
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,880
He is a doctor that can kill.

114
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:11,840
So a Hippocratic Oath is something that every doctor takes to make that basically means you don't kill.

115
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,220
That's like the whole premise.

116
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,360
Nah, fuck that shit, dude.

117
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,200
Like that's the Oath.

118
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,220
You make an Oath that you would never kill.

119
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,920
I ain't making an Oath.

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,620
I guess intentionally.

121
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,760
It's something I can't promise, you know?

122
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,700
That's true.

123
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,460
What if I walk in the room and then they decided blow himself up?

124
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,300
You know, like, that's not really on me.

125
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,360
That's not your fault.

126
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,680
But it's going to look like I did it, dude.

127
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,380
I walk down.

128
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,740
How would it look like you did it?

129
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,840
You carry a bomb around you all the time as a doctor?

130
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,800
Yeah, you never know when the next Hex of Solomonka is going to appear in a fucking room, you know.

131
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,460
Why would you carry a bomb around you?

132
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,400
Just carry a gun.

133
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,300
It's a Hex of Solomonka.

134
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,740
Well, I mean, a bomb can come in handy.

135
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,260
Ooh, talking about a bomb.

136
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,820

You can call it.

142
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,600
I don't even know if my guns are...

143
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,140
Oh, you got a key card.

144
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,500
You can get attacked with that.

145
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,360
Did you know that?

146
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,660
Yeah, I got a key card.

147
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,960
Well, are we playing with bots?

148
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,320
I don't know.

149
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,720
How do I use my key card?

150
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,520
So you gotta go to that right.

151
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,980
You see what...

152
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,220
Is it a vehicle trailer?

153
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,980
Yeah, yeah, that one, that one.

154
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,760
We gotta go there.

155
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

156
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,420
Nice box.

157
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,440
I know.

158
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,880
I hope we're against bots because like we need we need help.

159
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,700
We need help.

160
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,340
Yeah, we need something.

161
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,480
Can you buy the defib in this in this?

162
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,960
I think you gotta be a doctor to use the defib, don't you?

163
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,080
Like other than 10 years of education.

164
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,600
You become good friends with people in the government, you know?

165
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,160
Oh, that's true, true.

166
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,460
I can just, like, you know, use political power to become a doctor.

167
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:30,980
Yes, sir.

168
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,740
We can get a tank for this.

169
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,380
Oh, I have a vehicle card.

170
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:34,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

171
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,660
That's great.

172
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,300
How do I do it?

173
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,800
Confirm.

174
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,460
The tanks are broken.

175
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,040
I don't know.

176
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,880
Do I go over here and just use my slide my card?

177
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,740
I think over here.

178
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:44,960
All right.

179
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,920
I'll go for it.

180
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,580
All right.

181
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,280
Granted.

182
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,000
I got it.

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,700
Now we just got to wait.

184
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,860
It's a loot box, Axel.

185
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,680
The loot box.

186
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,360
Yay.

187
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,640
Yes, sir.

188
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:54,860
Oh, my God.

189
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,020
Come on, give me a Lamborghini.

190
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:56,800
Lamborghini.

191
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,080
Come on, gold, gold, gold.

192
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,440
I just want a tank.

193
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,380
Gold, gold, gold.

194
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,020
I don't even want a Lamborghini.

195
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,940
I want a cyber truck.

196
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,160
It looks so fucking ugly.

197
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,020
I just want good hard pot, man.

198
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,140
All right, hop on in, bitches.

199
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,400
It's a tank.

200
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,420
All right.

201
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,100
Oh, I got the cannon.

202
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,480
Do I get anything?

203
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,400
Don't chill in.

204
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,620
All right, if you...

205
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,740
Oh, I'll tear.

206
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,140
I'll tear.

207
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,460
You're literally the driver.

208
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,160
Why did you get out of the car?

209
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,560
I thought trapped in there with you.

210
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,020
Targeted.

211
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,220
Wait, what?

212
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,660
Who's targeting us?

213
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,260
I don't know.

214
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,000
How do people even target us?

215
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,520
It's a tank in the arena, I think.

216
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,960
Okay, we just got to find people and kill them, you know?

217
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,500
Yeah, yeah.

218
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,760
Can we run the whole river with a tank?

219
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,000
I think so.

220
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,080
Oh, okay.

221
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:45,780
We just should.

222
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,060
Beep, beep.

223
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,560
Beep, beep, beep.

224
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,500
Signal rate.

225
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,480
Oh, so there's a mission that someone picked where they try to kill us.

226
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,480
Oh Someone picked a mission to destroy our tank What we did to do that we worked hard for this tank.

227
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,280
It's our family tank.

228
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,060
Oh, wait is it that?

229
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,980
Is it that red shit over there Oh shit.

230
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,840
What the fuck?

231
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,300
I can't move.

232
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,860
I can't move.

233
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,220
Oh my god.

234
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:13,620
Its findings.

235
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,160
Spiders.

236
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:14,700
I see him.

237
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,080
I see him.

238
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,940
It's the finest his finest.

239
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,480
Oh my god.

240
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:16,880
I'm leaving.

241
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:17,920
I'm leaving.

242
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:18,900
I'm leaving.

243
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,600
Oh my god.

244
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,720
Oh, artillery, battalion.

245
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:22,360

246
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,180
I don't think they're bots they're not they're bots.

247
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,320
They were absolutely not bots.

248
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,600
17, purple.

249
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,520
They're coming up, coming up, coming up.

250
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

251
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,580
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,500
Wait, wake up.

256
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,240
I accidentally hit that guy with that.

257
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,300
He was behind me this entire time?

258
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,680
Yeah, I was fucking him.

00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,960

He's still alive.

277
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,680
You haven't killed him.

278
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,320

I didn't see him.

283
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:41,880
He's right there.

284
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,120

He's fine!

297
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,980
He doesn't need help!

298
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,920
He doesn't need help!

299
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,960
He's full HP.

300
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,040
He's full HP.

301
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,380
I got him!

302
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:04,960
I killed him!

303
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,740
Oh my goodness!

304
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,940
Wait, there's a guy in front of us!

305
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,520
He's right here!

306
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,300
He's right here!

307
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,500
Yeah, I don't really have cover.

308
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,020
I'm gonna back up a little.

309
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,820
Oh my god, wait.

310
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,720
You can rest me behind this wall.

311
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,680
This wall is safe.

312
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,140
This wall is safe.

313
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,060
Okay, okay, okay.

314
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,240
I got sniped.

315
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,900
Okay, take it, take it.

316
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,080
Okay, I'm ready.

317
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,460
Appreciate it, appreciate it.

318
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,540
Here you go, you're so safe.

319
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,180
You're still healthy.

320
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,040
I think, oh, oh my god.

321
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,600
I got, I got, I got police deal again.

322
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,300
There's an artillery.

323
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,660
I'm backing up.

324
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,780
Oh, we got squad weight.

325
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,380
We got squad.

326
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,660
Yeah, we got squad weight.

327
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,280
We got a squad weight.

328
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,740
I'm grabbing armor.

329
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,620
One of my favorite points is over the edge.

330
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,520
Oh, my God.

331
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,580
I got half of these freaking strikes!

332
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,980
Okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

333
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,540
Holy fuck.

334
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,660
Okay, I think we're fine.

335
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,240
We're fine.

336
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,980
We're still healthy.

337
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,100
I didn't get a chance to lose.

338
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,620
Is there a tank?

339
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:03,780
Aish.

340
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,960
Oh my god.

341
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,900
My back was wide open.

342
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,140
We are so healthy.

343
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,400
Oh, we are not healthy!

344
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,480
We are not healthy!

345
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,060
That's a tank, that's a tank, that's a tank.

346
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:14,780
That's a tank, that's a tank.

347
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,080
Ooh, is a tank?

348
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,020
Who's a tank?

349
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,720
Look at him in the middle!

You saw me.

357
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,090

00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,180
Oh, guys, guys.

360
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,400
Guys.

361
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,100
There is a...

362
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,800
Hello, hello, hello.

363
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,340
Good luck and see you in the next life.

364
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,300
Yes, okay.

365
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,740
Remember me.

366
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,380
No, Axel, no.

367
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,640
Remember me, please.

368
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:50,940
He

369
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,500
was so low.

370
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,080
Okay, it's okay.

371
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,420
Axel is alive.

372
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh, okay.

373
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:01,500
Never mind.

374
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,320
What the hell are they?

375
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,400
What the hell are they?

376
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:04,920
Oh.

377
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,080
That's too difficult, man.

378
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,640
That's too difficult.

379
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,600
To be fair, we're all split up.

380
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:11,980
Okay.

381
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,220
How many teams are there?

382
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,860
How many teams in total?

383
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,920
I think there's like 70, 80, 90.

384
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,560
Couple.

385
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,380
Yep.

386
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,960
I just, you know, we were learning.

387
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,220
Elter and I were learning.

388
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:33,020
So, you know, like, I think we did pretty good for people who never know how to play the game yet, you know.

389
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,320
I'm level 2.

390
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,320
Yeah, wait, am I level 2?

391
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,700
Yeah, I'm level 2 too.

392
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,060
Wait, I think?

393
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,840
Why do you always have to steal my thunder?

394
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,340
Wait, no, you're level 1.

395
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,380
What do you mean?

396
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,920
I'm level 2.

397
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,000
No, you're not.

398
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,820
I can see it.

399
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,100
You can't gaslight me like this.

400
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,340
No, I won't let it happen.

401
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:50,820
I love it.

402
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,520
I can't literally see that you're level 1.

403
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:28,580

404
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,660
It was like, you're not ready.

405
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,200
Apparently there's 25 squads, so we did okay.

406
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,400
Yeah, we did pretty well.

407
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,760
We're not last.

408
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,720
That's all that matters.

409
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,360
You're not the worst.

410
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,040
I just wish Axel would carry a little bit more.

411
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:40,700
Yeah, I know, right?

412
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,860
Yeah, look at the score.

413
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,520
You know.

414
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,540
Look at that.

415
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,580
Altair got three kills.

416
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,140
I was harassing them.

417
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,120
Altair got three kills.

418
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,520
Well, physically damage and mental damage.

419
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,560
Mental damage is sometimes more important.

Only these raw skills.

426
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,800

Is there friendly fire in this game?

441
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:37,980
We got holes on us.

442
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,860
We got holes on us.

443
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,620

All right.

446
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,020
There is.

447
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,180
Is there or is there not?

448
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,660
Okay, no.

449
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,000
Okay.

450
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,320
I was gonna test it out with someone.

451
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,460
There isn't.

452
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,540
All right.

453
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,140
Who'd you shoot?

454
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,060
You shot me.

455
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,560
No, I didn't.

456
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,940
You don't have proof.

457
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,140
So you didn't take damage.

458
00:19:59,340 --> 00:19:59,500
Wow.

459
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,160
I can't believe you were shooting me like that.

460
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,900
You have no proof.

461
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,880
You took no damage.

462
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,440
Can't believe it.

463
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,120
I looked.

464
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,400
I saw it in the above.

465
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,540
Alright, let's see.

466
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,380
I was shooting the sidearm around.

467
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:09,740
Oh, that's not you!

468
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,100
Oh, that's not you!

469
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:11,600
That's not you!

470
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,280
Okay.

471
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,760
Oh, you see me?

472
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,080
I fell from the sky like Spider-Man.

473
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,540
Oh, my God.

474
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,540
My hero.

475
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,460
Okay, you got...

476
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:21,760
Yeah, maybe.

477
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:23,900
Where, where?

478
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,040
Okay, he's dead.

479
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,620
He's dead.

480
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,140
Oh, he's dead.

481
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,180
I thought it was you shooting me again, but this time I took damage.

482
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,820
Also, there's a guy right here.

483
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,700
All part of my plan.

484
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,060
Oh, I see you.

485
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,340
Where's the slide?

486
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,700
How do you slide in this game?

487
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,160
Double tap C.

488
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,240
Double tap C.

489
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:42,540
Yeah.

490
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,180
Oh, my God.

491
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,440
Okay, hero assassin has a tank.

492
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,020
I don't know how.

493
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,940
Oh, army, army, army.

494
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,960
Inside, inside, inside.

495
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,060
He dumped him, locked him.

496
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,120
Yeah, we got both.

497
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,640
We got both.

498
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,600
That's right.

499
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,180
Oh.

500
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:56,540
That's right.

501
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:56,960
Tag!

502
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,920
I got healer.

503
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,080
Alright.

504
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,820
Oh, they had good guns.

505
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,580
Yeah, they do.

506
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,200
Thank you.

507
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,980
Thank you for your guns.

508
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,960
Thank you for kind donation.

509
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,440
I wonder where's the last guy?

510
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,280
That wasn't a squad right, though.

511
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:16,980
Homeboy died.

512
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,960
Oh shit, assassin.

513
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,820
Wait, how did he die?

514
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,380
Oh, here!

515
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:21,980
I see him.

516
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,880
He's peeking through the...

517
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,520
Oh, that's how he died!

518
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,400
That's how he died!

519
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,420
He has a missile.

520
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,440
He's right here.

521
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,940
Well you know what?

522
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,260
That's when you go close range.

523
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:33,940
Yeah!

524
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,700
I believe in you.

525
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,200
I'll watch from far far here.

526
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,200
Oh there he is!

527
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,660
He is over here.

528
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,020
He's over here.

529
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,580
Behind this.

530
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,100
Behind this.

531
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:39,800
Oh my god.

532
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,480
Behind that, behind you.

533
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:42,760
Nice.

534
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,480
That's right.

535
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,180
...say hi to my grandma in the grave.

536
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,160
Damn.

537
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,880
Where the fuck is our guy?

538
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,620
Maybe inside?

539
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,040
Oh he says the bazooka.

540
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,100
Yeah you dead dad.

541
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,160
Don't worry he'll redeploy.

542
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,280
No, no, he's still alive.

543
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,320
Mr. High Assassin.

544
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,680
Yeah, he's coming back.

545
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,880
He got kicked out of hell.

546
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,010
Whoa!

547
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:07,730
What?

548
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:07,990
What?

549
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:08,470
What?

550
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:08,690
What?

551
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,370
Our welding just exploded behind us.

552
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:11,930
Oh, no.

553
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,370
Wait, someone's got to be in there.

554
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:13,830
What do I have?

555
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:14,670
People, people, people, people.

556
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,050
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, ping, ping, ping, ping.

557
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,230
Okay.

558
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:18,750
I got a scout.

559
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,550
I'll take high ground.

560
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,770
I don't know where high ground is.

561
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:24,570
I'm going to...

562
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:25,790
There's somewhere on the left side, I think.

563
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,010
I can't...

564
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,270
I don't think I can take high ground.

565
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,210
Oh, he was on the left.

566
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:29,970
Oh, he was on the left.

567
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:30,490
All right.

568
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:30,930
Oh, no.

569
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,110
That's not supposed to be just out there that I was just shooting.

570
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,270
One more, one more, one more, one more.

571
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:34,650
Oh, yeah, yeah.

572
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:34,810
I see him.

573
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:34,990
I see him.

574
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:35,630
They parachuted.

575
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,210
So, they parachuted.

576
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,730
Good another day.

577
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,070
I don't see anyone.

578
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:42,670
Can you guys ping?

579
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:43,270
Dude, Dad?

580
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,870
Ah, he's back.

581
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:45,990
Hmm.

582
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,530
We're somewhere over here.

583
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,210
Yeah, I saw like, oh, I see him.

584
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,570
I see him.

585
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:49,990
Fandom.

586
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,870
Ooh, this gun sucks.

587
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:52,830
He's right here.

588
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,730
He's right here on the roof.

589
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,350
He heard me.

590
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,230
I shot my gun.

591
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,270
He's still behind this.

592
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,770
He's just behind this area.

593
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,670
Called Killed on, killed on.

594
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,490
Oh, he's not pushing up.

595
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,290
He's not peeking.

596
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:04,870
He's not peeking me.

597
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,090
He's still behind here.

598
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,510
Wait, this is a different guy?

599
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,150
I thought- Parachute towards us.

600
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,450
What the heck?

601
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,390

603

He's shooting at a different team.

609
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,630

Oh, I wonder what that is.

Give it a few of us.

658
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,490

00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

All right, it's fine.

664
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,250
We can read a play to people.

665
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,270
That was a quickie.

666
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,590
Yeah, yeah, see?

00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:24,930

I'll break through this glass.

684
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,030
I'm going to loot in.

685
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:24,930
Oh, shit.

686
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:25,390
Okay, never.

687
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,330
That's scared me.

688
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,090
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

689
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:29,890
Chill, man.

690
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:30,990
There's shots West 300.

691
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,330
West 300.

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,490

Oh, do you need heals?

695
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,910
Oh, there is a lot of gunshots over there.

696
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,110
Oh my god.

697
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,010
I think they're shooting at us, guys.

698
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:47,930
Yeah, I think so too.

699
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,870
They might be shooting at us.

700
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,230
Let's just give them the axle and then we'll run.

701
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,110
All right, let's see.

702
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,130
I should need this gun.

703
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,090
Sacrifice.

704
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,490
Oh, I killed one.

705
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:58,690
How?

706
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,930
Oh, I killed another.

707
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,010
Oh, no, wait, wait.

708
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:03,970
Where were you?

709
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:04,950
Actually, you got to talk.

710
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,550
You got to talk.

711
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,310
Oh, it's a truck.

712
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:06,830
It's a truck.

713
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,270
There's two holes in the truck.

714
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,250
Oh, there's two holes.

715
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:09,750
Okay, okay.

716
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,890
There is a redeploy tower to my left, everyone.

717
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,170
Oh, I see, I see it.

718
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,010
Getting shot from the cross.

719
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:16,830
Oh, we're there, over there.

720
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,850
Ah, there's just too many on us.

721
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,890
It's over on my left, on my left.

722
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,210
Is the guy next to that redeploy tower?

723
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,250
Yeah, I know.

724
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,590
I can't do anything about it.

725
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,270
I was trying to get there and then...

728
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,500
Oh, hey, a loot box.

729
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:05,960
Oh, hey.

730
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,340
Mr. High Assassin only plays like an assassin.

731
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,640
He's just maddened and hired.

732
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,160
I know, that means he's been doing this for, like, since Battle Royale was released.

733
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,560
All he did is just hide.

734
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,060
I don't think he's ever won a game in his life.

735
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,380
All right, here we go.

736
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,800
Oh, he is, Mr. High Assassin.

737
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,200
He only plays at this time while high.

738
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,320
While being an assassin.

739
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,720
Oh boy 1041.

740
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,940
Oh boy.

741
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,920
Oh boy.

742
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,240
It'd be a shame if.

743
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,020
Oh boy.

744
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,400
Oh boy.

745
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,860
Let's hope.

746
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,700
Nobody comes up.

747
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,720
Oh shit.

748
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,460

He ain't cheating.

783
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,020
He was shooting the wall though.

784
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,740
Okay, like, why was he looking at that wall and tracking someone?

785
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:36,800
I don't know.

786
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,880

787
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:39,820

13.

794
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,260
Not bad.

795
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:46,760
Not bad.

796
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,760
I only got two kills.

797
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,380
I was smoking them, dude.

798
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:49,980
Yeah, I won.

799
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,620
Yeah, I won.

800
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,060
Okay, but you did kill steal.

00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,040
Two of those kills were mine.

804
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,120
I was almost sick.

805
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,320
Ah, shit, okay.

806
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,440

Obviously, you stole Altair's kills too, right?

810
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,920
You want to steal from the noobs?

811
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,540
That's fucking crazy.

812
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,620

00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,600
I'm not like at a fucking supermarket at 10 a.m.

What are they doing?

819
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,340
Why are they watching, Axel?

820
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,840
Are they jealous?

821

I sold.

857
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,280
Everything's done.

858
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:39,680
I'm out.

859
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,000
I was like, guys, I don't know.

860
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,260
Guys, I don't think you guys should keep opening for knives, guys.

861
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,480
You would have made so much money.

862
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:48,920
Yeah.

863
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,740
I don't know, guys.

864
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,460
Yeah, they...

865
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,380
For those who don't know...

866
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,600
You would have made so much money, Madrilla.

867
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,980
You should have done it.

868
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,480
For those who don't know, these two try to get me to buy cases.

869
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,400
And I was like...

870
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,680
You missed out on the hype, you know?

871
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,400
Yeah, yeah, what hype?

872
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,220
It's okay, it's better.

873
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:04,640
It's better.

874
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,320
Oh, yeah, okay.

875
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,060
So what's your portfolio like now?

876
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,020
After your investment?

877
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,360
Oh, I think I made like 3 or 4K off of just knives.

878
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,220
I'm not even kidding.

879
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,120
Wait, really?

880
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,340

00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,400
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.

882
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,440
Okay, but what's...

883
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,260
Okay, overall profit?

884
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,460
Or what?

885
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,180
Overall profit.

886
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,100
Yeah, overall profit.

887
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,080
I don't believe you.

888
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,100
I think you've lost.

889
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,020
I think you've lost money.

890
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,440
I'm always good at that shit, you know?

891
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,560
How the heck did I open that?

892
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,820
Artillery strike.

893
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,060
Air strike.

894
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:39,640

00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,780
Oh, that's good.

Machine gun.

Okay, I have a machine gun upgrade kit if anyone wants it.

920
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,000
Because I don't think I can.

921
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,380
I can't upgrade mine for some reason.

922
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,760

923
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,520

924
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,580

Watch this.

938
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,140
Area marked.

939
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,280
There's people in it.

940
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:31,920
In front of me.

941
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,260
Okay, okay.

942
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,680
Oh, no, no, don't worry.

943
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:32,920
Don't worry.

944
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,920
I have something that's coming in very soon.

945
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,780
Oh, my God, reloading.

946
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,660
I'm reloading.

947
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,260
Okay, it's fine.

948
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:40,740
Don't worry.

949
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,260
I have...

950
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:41,840
Don't worry.

951
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,680
I deployed the smoke.

952
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,900
This is why I needed it.

953
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:44,900
I killed one.

954
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,100
Okay, on my way.

955
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:46,780
Nice, nice, nice.

956
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:48,700
I have someone on me.

957
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,680
Can we have someone on me?

958
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,160
I killed another, killed another, killed another.

959
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,320
Nice, nice, nice.

960
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,600
Oh, I think we pulled down, pulled down.

961
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,940
I didn't even see anyone.

962
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:00,960
It's fine.

963
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,800
Oh my god, that smoke actually worked.

964
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,160
Oh, I just, I got shot at it.

965
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,120
Used it for myself.

966
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,240
That's crazy.

967
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,120
Oh, I got an intel case.

968
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,260
I got XP for us.

969
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,380
Nice.

970
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,800
I did that.

971
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,280
I used the smoke from a joke and it actually worked out for me.

972
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:17,980
Oh, hey.

973
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:18,700
Oh, hey.

974
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,180
Oh, what is this?

975
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,700
Oh, it's just a sniper rifle.

976
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,260
Oh, there's an airstrike.

977
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,420
Does anyone want the airstrike?

978
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,820
I got an airstrike.

979
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,720
I'll take it then.

980
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,620
What did we just do four airstrikes on that?

981
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,960
Oh my gosh, imagine.

982
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,520
You know what?

983
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,580
Let's do it.

984
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,380
Boom!

985
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,840
I'm receiving you four booms today.

986
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,740
Yeah, boom!

987
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:40,200
Boom!

988
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:40,880
Boom!

989
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,860
Still getting kills like... Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, where is...

990
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,940
Oh, I see him, I see him.

Nice.

992
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,960
Nice shot.

993
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,340
Don't worry.

994
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,700
I put an airstrike right there.

995
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,740
Wait, no, no, I'm running up.

996
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

997
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,440
Oh, he's dead.

998
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,760
Yeah, no, it's shit.

999
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,260
He's dead.

1000
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,420
We killed him.

1001
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,280
But how did you get up there?

1002
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,060
There's a ladder.

1003
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,080
Wait.

1004
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,840
Air strike next to us.

1005
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,520
Oh, there is an air strike next to us.

1006
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,120
What if you just send a couple more?

1007
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:18,540
Yeah.

1008
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,740
Alright, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.

1009
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,060
Don't be pussy.

1010
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,820
I'm looking through the thermal thingy.

1011
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
I'm seeing people.

1012
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,740
Yeah, where are these people?

1013
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,640
I'm sending it in.

1014
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,600
I don't see anyone out there.

1015
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,020
Where is this guy's team, too?

1016
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,560
Because it wasn't a full down.

1017
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,080
Oh, what is going on?

1018
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,560
Holy shit.

1019
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,840
Guys, I don't know they're still there anymore.

1020
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,420
You see anybody under your thermal?

1021
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,460
Left side.

1022
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,000

00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,400
Destroy their home.

1060
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,700
And their bloodline and ancestry.

1061
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,560
Oh my goodness.

1062
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,760
What the fuck on my knees?

1063
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,340
You got your breath flew into that glass.

1064
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,440
That's it?

1065
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,140
Well, that was nothing.

1066
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,040
The airstrike fucking sucked.

1067
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,680
That was like one shot.

1068
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,420
Did I take this over?

1069
00:42:51,340 --> 00:43:13,320

There's a long-range weapon here.

1071
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,740
I just looked at him!

1072
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,080
I just looked at him!

1073
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,060
I was wondering why you were looking at him!

1074
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:30,880
Did he have armor?

1075
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,140
No, he doesn't.

1076
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,720
Oh yeah, it's not rifle.

1077
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,000
I'll upgrade that.

1078
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,820
Oh, there's a sniper rifle too.

1079
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,260
Oh, squad white.

1080
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:38,980
Nice.

1081
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,700
Is there an extra armor?

1082
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,180
I got a few.

1083
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:43,880
I got a few.

1084
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,140
How the fuck did I drop this?

1085
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,800
Alright, drop some armor here.

1086
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,120
What the heck is that?

1087
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,360
They fortnight built everything.

1088
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,160
I am...

1089
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:54,740
You guys see that?

1090
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,740
I'm armoring up.

1091
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,260
I'm armoring up.

1092
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,380
What the hell is that?

1093
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,840
What are you guys looking at?

1094
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,940
I just saw you fought.

1095
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:01,700
Nah, that is...

1096
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:01,920
East 30.

1097
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:02,400
East 30.

1098
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,180
East 30.

1099
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,420
Jesus Christ.

1100
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,780
Alright, no more second chance ladies.

1101
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,100
Oh, alright.

1102
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,120
We don't need second chance.

1103
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:09,640
We're gamers.

1104
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,780
Not an ammo.

1105
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:11,800
Oh, okay.

1106
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,380
That's not good.

1107
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:12,880
Never mind.

1108
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:13,900
Where are you guys...

1109
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,760
Where are they shooting?

1110
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,660
Where are you shooting at?

1111
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,540
East 30 up the hill.

1112
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,380
There's a floating platform.

1113
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,580
Oh my god, wait, they aren't?

1114
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,200
Oh my god, wait, he hits that?

1115
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,680
Yeah, he's kind of crazy.

1116
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,120
I don't even know.

1117
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,040
He's crazy with that.

1118
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,580
I don't even know, like, my drop-off for this.

1119
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,020
Wait, they are actually hitting.

1120
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,380
As I'm saying, I don't even know the drop-off for this.

1121
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Holy shit, they said, they really said, let me hit.

1122
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,260
And I was like, okay.

1123
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,540
Okay, I'm gonna be high.

1124
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,240
He has to be high.

1125
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,480
There's a car below us.

1126
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,760
Okay, we gotta go to the zone.

1127
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,220
Guys, guys, guys, we gotta go to the zone.

1128
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:51,780
leaving.

1129
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,240
Okay, I'm heading over there.

1130
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,220
How do I jump on here?

1131
00:44:59,400 --> 00:44:59,700
Oh, I'm Serpentine.

1132
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,960
I'm moving into Zarn.

1133
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:01,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1134
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,500
I'm moving too.

1135
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,540
I'm moving as well with you.

1136
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,280
I'm right behind you.

1137
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,800
They're still trying.

1138
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,840
The Fortniteers are still trying to shoot at us.

1139
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,060
It's okay.

1140
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,340
Let them Fortnite, you know?

1141
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:11,900
All right.

1142
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,960
I see gunshots to our left.

1143
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,240
I hear gunshots to our left.

1144
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:18,820
But how far?

1145
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,480
Oh, we are so far from zone.

1146
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:23,780
Wee!

1147
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,160
You can cut these people off at chemical storage ahead of us.

1148
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:26,620
Where are you going, Axel?

1149
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,880
Axel, where the fuck are you going?

1150
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,440
We're going to go in a zone.

1151
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,360
It's the blue ship, right?

1152
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:32,820
We gotta go.

1153
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,540
Yeah, I was just shooting up the guys on the left.

1154
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,740
Oh, okay, because I was just sitting.

1155
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,420
People on the left.

1156
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,280
Yeah, yeah, people behind us?

1157
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:39,920
Behind us?

1158
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:40,460
Oh, I'm looking.

1159
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,400
Oh, he's behind that box.

1160
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,720
Oh, you are so close to the zone, the zone, the zone, though.

1161
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:47,560
That's it.

1162
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:47,980
It's okay.

1163
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,360
I'm running.

1164
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,520
I'm with...

1165
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,260
Intel case.

1166
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,480
I'm with Altair right now.

1167
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,560
That people...

1168
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,260
West 330, West 330.

1169
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:00,180
West 330.

1170
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:00,700
They're running away.

1171
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,200
I'm going right...

1172
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,760
Who the fuck is that an artillery drop?

1173
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:06,860
Okay.

1174
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,780
I might be the first one that gets shot at, and I also have the least HP.

1175
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,660
So, good luck to me.

1176
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,160
I don't know how to drop any to you.

1177
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:14,680
I'm sorry.

1178
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,280
That's okay.

1179
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:15,800
It's okay.

1180
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,960

00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,220
Yeah, I was firing those.

1228
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,180
He's a hero.

1229
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,840
I was sticking in those guys' ass too.

1230
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:04,920
Are you still there?

1231
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:05,940
Are you still behind us?

1232
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,140
Yeah, they are.

1233
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:07,740

1253
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,400
Looking for AR ammo.

1254
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,400

01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:28,490

1611
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:36,310

01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:01,970
13.

1623
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:04,550
Not top 10 though.

1624
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:05,270
Wait.

1625
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:06,570
Hades.

1626
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:11,980
I go I go convince us not to kick you

1627
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:22,090

1628
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:38,450
Fight for your spot Hades Who left the lobby wait did he leave the lobby there's no way He actually no he said Bad.

1629
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:39,850
No, he's bad already.

1630
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:45,690
I can't believe it.

1631
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:47,210
He's not trying to convince us.

1632
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:48,810
He left our party.

1633
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:49,870
Wait, he left?

1634
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:51,630
Uh-oh.

1635
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:53,990
You guys made him mad.

1636
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:55,870
No, it wasn't me.

1637
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:57,090
It wasn't me.

1638
01:12:57,150 --> 01:12:59,150
I think it's because someone didn't cover us.

1639
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,670
I was covering you.

1640
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,070
I was watching these people very gently.

1641
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:06,830
He left because someone else didn't cover us.

1642
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:07,770
It wasn't me.

1643
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:10,570
Axel, why didn't you cover her?

1644
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:12,430
Yeah, Axel, why didn't you cover us?

1645
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:13,810
I was dead.

1646
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:15,730
Come on, Axel.

1647
01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:18,090

1650
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:23,110
You could have been alive.

1651
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:24,430
This lab is falling for me.

1652
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:26,310
You know, all in all, Hades was pretty cool.

1653
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:29,190
Yeah, he was pretty.

1654
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:31,470
He was pretty pretty, all right.

1655
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:34,890
He was better than Axel.

1656
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:37,550

Axel still wouldn't do it.

1684
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,700
He'd let that guy die.

1685
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:45,000
We're open to replacements.

1686
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:46,140
We're open to...

1687
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:49,080
You know, we're opening auditions.

1688
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:54,120
Opening auditions for the newest English wave of...

1689
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,160
This is the Replace Axel series?

1690
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:02,760
They will be my test subjects.

1691
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:07,000
What will happen to a human if you put them in...

1692
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,500
You know, like in a pressure cooker?

1693
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:09,380
What?

1694
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,220
Why a pressure cooker?

1695
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,440
Ooh, I wonder what would happen.

1696
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,580
I feel like someone has done it before.

1697
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,600
Well, it depends on like...

1698
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:18,740
Microwave.

1699
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:18,800
Microwave.

1700
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,060
No, it's like you can...

1701
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:22,340
What would happen to this poor little man if I put him in a microwave?

1702
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:23,160
I mean, radiation.

1703
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,500
Microwave is a radiation.

1704
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:26,640
I'll just be the next Mr. Beast.

1705
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,960
What would happen if I put someone in a microwave?

1706
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,340

All right.

1723
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:05,550

1724
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:06,970

01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:29,180
Oh, you guys tried it?

2043
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,060
How did it feel?

2044
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:30,840
I haven't tried it.

2045
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:31,900
Oh, why not?

2046
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:33,460
Just just do the sack whack.

2047
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:35,540
The sack whack hurts even more, doesn't it?

2048
01:40:36,400 --> 01:41:08,400
okay but like why hasn't wait so you and axel haven't tried it nah why not yet uh lack of opportunity i mean yeah i'll just order it on i'll give you okay for like order and i'll pay you guys order it on amazon what did i pay you guys and have you as ordered each of you i once walked into a chemist like whoa guys check it out nice oh no chemist and i was like guys the zone is coming where you can feel fucking like period pain and they They looked at me like in confusion when I went to the chemist.

2049
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:09,300
What?

2050
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:10,500
They don't have that shit.

2051
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:12,100
I don't know.

2052
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:14,240
I thought you could just buy it at the fucking chemist, man.

2053
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,380
If you go there like- Why would you buy it at the chemist?

2054
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:17,420
You mean the pharmacy?

2055
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:18,740
I don't know.

2056
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:20,380
Yeah, you can get like no care.

2057
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:22,940
We can't fucking just order it off the pharmacy.

2058
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:26,460
What the- Just sell it off the counter?

2059
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:29,120
Yeah, I was saying they're close to you though there.

2060
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,820
They might as well sell, you know, like period pain simulator too.

2061
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,300
It was like, you know, it's close enough.

2062
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:34,180
80% similarity.

2063
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:35,400
They just have it.

2064
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:35,780
Yeah.

2065
01:41:35,800 --> 01:42:06,740
out of like that's part of their inventory I have the inventory stock in the back you know oh wait there's a redeploy tower simulator too and you guys have like they didn't have it they said I had to get it on Amazon but I was like no I don't want to shit on Amazon I'm old school you know I'm old school you don't want the drones to send you um I'm going over to Rez Axel wait there's someone resing there you can hear the Ready?

2066
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:07,500
Yeah, yeah, look, look.

2067
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:08,180
The tower's moving.

2068
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:08,600
Look, look.

2069
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:09,400
Oh my god!

2070
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:09,840
Right in front of you.

2071
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:11,920
That's not him.

2072
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:12,420
Only one person.

2073
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,040
Only one person.

2074
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:13,980
Two people.

2075
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:14,860
Wait, no.

2076
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:15,260
It's okay.

2077
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:17,260
You can, you can- No, you can kill your looks.

2078
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:20,640
Okay.

2079
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:21,480
Nice.

2080
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:22,320
That's not squad white though.

2081
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:23,040
That's not squad white.

2082
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:23,520
There's people behind you.

2083
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:24,300
People behind you, careful.

2084
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:25,200
Yeah, because they raised.

2085
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:25,620
They raised.

2086
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:26,220
That's why.

2087
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:28,100
Oh, that's not good.

2088
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:30,080
Nice.

2089
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:30,580
Cool, it's cool.

2090
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:32,680
You guys, I don't even know where I killed this guy.

2091
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:34,560
I don't know where- Oh shit!

2092
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:34,960
Oh shit!

2093
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:35,440

Wow.

2095
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:39,680
I don't know where that was.

2096
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,820
There's another redeploy tower out there.

2097
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:43,700
Yeah, yeah, that's the one I was supposed to go.

2098
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:45,220

01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:49,360
Oh, you finished him.

2100
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:49,900
He disconnected.

2101
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:52,360
I'm still getting shot at.

2102
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:52,900
I'm still getting shot.

2103
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:54,020
Oh my god, I'm still getting shot.

2104
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:55,980
I'm still getting shot at.

2105
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:01,960
See, this is why he dropped out of chemistry, you know, because chemistry is too hard.

2106
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:03,280
I hate chemistry.

2107
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:37,540

2117
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:47,000
Let's get over to the redeploy.

2118
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:48,860
Yeah, it's got this.

2119

I believe in you.

2120
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:51,880
Wait, a chemistry was hard.

2121
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,580
You know, biology was the easiest.

2122
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:55,140
Physics was my favorite.

2123
01:43:55,420 --> 01:43:55,900
I like physics.

2124
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:56,560
Really.

2125
01:43:56,740 --> 01:43:58,140
Physics is hard as well.

2126
01:43:58,800 --> 01:43:59,540
It was just all math.

2127
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:01,500
It was just all equations you just plug in.

2128
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:01,960
Man, it's easy.

2129
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:03,520
Biology is the easiest.

2130
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:32,860
You just have to remember like which part of the limb you want to rip off on someone and then oh did you dissect frogs with their higher the resting someone oh yeah no we dissected um a sheep's brain oh i dissected a frog really i detected a like a sheep's uh oh where did you go excellent oh did they think i was like some criminal talking about where did you go excellent what happened maybe the game was like no no you mean you were not

2131
01:44:36,540 --> 01:45:55,780
got down bus bus how did that happen we're trying to read uh resurrect axle and then oh my god and the next just disappeared it kicked me why yeah i was gonna say what happened to you maybe i was like too much of a medicine the game you know and yeah i got uh filtered maybe just too good i don't think i just talking about ripping off windows what's this i think i might be dead boys oh you see that yeah i don't think i'm heading there yeah this is what i mean like remember i was like oh you know when i get on the plane and i just pray like we don't have research i was talking about biology and killing shit and then they're like we're cutting it we're disconnecting him from the battlefield he's just gonna die it's just boom just get him yeah because they're like how dare you kill a sheep yeah exactly but i like lamb a lot lamb meat is behavior yeah i hear people right beside me by the way so like i hope they don't see me is good though whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa ptsd oh my god war war is

2132
01:45:55,780 --> 01:46:01,900
bad i'm okay oh my god

2133
01:46:05,800 --> 01:47:06,940
no worries it's very dangerous it is bad hey please i think we can make it to the top five i mean we got yeah we got a lot of kills okay that that art guy was insane though all right we gotta get out of the party though so we can actually i don't know how you got kicked out that's crazy i don't know what happened they were like hating on me yeah the game hates me bro they're like fuck this game like he's an australian man not kick his ass bro arc was i couldn't see i'm like a friend request to arc hey arc boy join our squad all right yeah oh where the hell did he go man yeah i'm adding him as a friend i'm out we can give you a show of my if you come join us yeah join us you get ruthlessly bullied yeah no no depending on how you do only only alteria is that bully come on no no we all know what you did to that poor man Hades.

2134
01:47:08,140 --> 01:47:09,780
We all saw what you did to him.

2135
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:11,420
I forgot about him.

2136
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:13,040
We saw what you did.

2137
01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:14,980
That's so messed up.

2138
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:16,340
You're right.

2139
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:18,240
Wait, Hades is still playing here.

2140
01:47:18,620 --> 01:47:22,280
Wait, he's still playing, but he just, like, left us.

2141
01:47:23,780 --> 01:47:25,720
He's actually still playing.

2142
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:28,120
Alright, Qo.

2143
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:28,860
Qo's up.

2144
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:29,920
Okay.

2145
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:32,080
One shawarma, please.

2146
01:47:33,060 --> 01:48:42,500
oh i didn't accept my friend request i'm sad what if i what if he was a big streamer i can message him add friend quick message let's play again soon i sent him a message i was like let's play again soon i'm gonna send him one too you suck yeah there's like a quick message thing i'll send him one two one shawarma please yeah we all send him a message maybe i'll accept it one v one i'm gonna trust yeah he's gonna report her for harassment no he can't we can't be wait where's okay we can't be reported for harassment if we each send him one message maybe even two messages from each of us like he can't they can't report us but i'm asking him for a shawarma that he's gonna report me for harassment there's no way we're just being really apparently men don't have the same muscles that stim that get stimulated during periods so they're kind of scams wait but then okay well the women have pain simulators of ball sack like ball sack pain simulators do they have that i don't think i think i think

2147
01:48:42,500 --> 01:49:54,380
that's possible should we kick jokey and try oh okay like you know how to self-defend myself if you try it's a science it's science like you attack a ball sack and then like a simulator and then you hit that and then it like imitates the damage the damage oh yeah to cancel your bloodline oh why am i like a control variant no no no no yeah yeah yeah we'll find someone else to do that for us why any volunteers we're like the scientists observe we're not the participants guys wait does this guy actually his he's born on he's 69 nice on the 69th day of april nice you can tell that you can tell he's not a zoomer because it's not six seven you know we could have done this entire collab without saying that i was what is all the american people in six seven man i have no idea where it came it's from like like a new generation thing uh it's like a rapper it's it's some It came from a rapper,

2148
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:56,580
but then it came from some chat on TikTok.

2149
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:59,440
And he does, like, the hand thing, like, the 6-7.

2150
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:00,440
6-7.

2151
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:01,980
Oh, you know what?

2152
01:50:02,060 --> 01:50:02,800
I found out.

2153
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:09,560
Okay, so, like, Marwa Rivals recently had, like, this, the land, the finals land, where it was, like, a million dollars.

2154
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:11,760
And then they were doing, like, team introduction.

2155
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:16,080
And one of the teams, everyone was, like, 6-7, like, as their team intro.

2156
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:17,700
And I was like, what the...

2157
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:18,720
And I asked about it.

2158
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:20,880
And apparently, it was, like, the...

2159
01:50:20,880 --> 01:51:23,880
it was like the media person who directed the intro they'd be like guys we gotta do something fun and relatable why don't you guys start doing six seven as your team intro and i was like and the relatable and then the day became the villains of the esports world yeah they're like guys we got these guys why don't we guys do something funny and relatable why don't you do the six seven pose for your team intro so you guys see the i think it was you guys check out the dark zero um the dark zero team intro for the land and you see all of them who the six seven that was because of the media person that told them they did not it was not like it was not consensual so that's what it means to be pr trained now it's not consensual six seven they not they are trained They were told they were told to do it.

2160
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:26,360
Ooh, a sniper.

2161
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:28,060
Ooh, what do we consume?

2162
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:29,060
I have a...

2163
01:51:29,060 --> 01:51:31,660
The brain rot is consuming everyone.

2164
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:35,120
Hey, I had probably never watched Skippity Toilet, so I think I'm...

2165
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:36,560
I think I'm doing okay.

2166
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:39,820
I had the Skippity Toilet backpack on Fortnite.

2167
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:41,240
I paid for it.

2168
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:44,520
You and I were...

2169
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:45,700
We are not the same.

2170
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:48,120
I'm better.

2171
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,560
I'm... I'm hip with the kids.

2172
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:50,780
Why shouldn't they give us that?

2173
01:51:50,880 --> 01:52:18,700
memes i missed the good old memes you know okay no no each generation has my dudes each generation has their own cringe-ass memes what was my cringe-ass meme every generation has a up meme like i i mean like there was there was e like that one that i don't know how the that one got popular if it wasn't markiplier i don't think it would have blown up

2174
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:24,880
It's still not working.

2175
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:28,500
Oh yeah, and then I can has cheeseburger.

2176
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:31,320

Mi-gusta?

2181
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:38,760
Okay, Mi-gusta was pretty.

2182
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:39,320
Mi-gusta.

2183
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,620
Mi-gusta was pretty pretty.

2184
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:42,340
Troll-lo-lo-lo.

2185
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:44,800
Troll-lo-lo-lo-lo.

2186
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:49,240
I mean, trolling, rage bait is basically new gen trolling.

2187
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:50,860
Yeah, rage bait is basically a new gen trolling.

2188
01:52:50,880 --> 01:53:26,820
he's literally just trolling yeah rage bait is new gen trolling that's literally what it means it's just what do you think is more derogatory though rage bait or troll i think trolling is just it it doesn't age well the tournament is just not as good i think yeah i i'd actually argue the opposite i think trolling is actually doing okay no it's it's kind of like for fun but then but rage baiting you you you thrive off the suffering for the people and that's a little bit too much no i love the word gaslighting that's my favorite oh gaslighting me too it's like basically manipulation but like but it sounds nice

2189
01:53:32,380 --> 01:54:45,060
despite going i remember when i first debuted our management was like so don't use the word gaslighting it's not a good word wait what really and i'm like really careful at the beginning yeah and i'm like stop trying to gaslight me man it's not a bad it's like the overwatch league where they said nope they weren't allowed to use the pepe frog because they thought it was like a really offensive infantry people were like penalized if they used a pepe frog not pepe man yeah yeah and then i remember like uh some overwatch players they got like uh they have to pay fines if they start t-bagging people that was crazy that's the though yeah let's make rivalries let's make storylines i know this is happening overwatch right here i don't know they see me they don't see me by the way they're just walking in front of me i'll wait for you guys i prone hey i didn't know that chat yeah some people got people were getting fine left and right for teabagging.

2197
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:10,700

2198
01:55:11,580 --> 01:55:12,380
Okay, guys.

2199
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:13,640
Don't worry, guys.

01:55:13,660 --> 01:55:14,860
I'm finding the door.

2201
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:19,580
Don't worry, guys.

2202
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:21,420
I'm still trying to find the door.

2203
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:25,500

2204
01:55:26,140 --> 01:55:26,460

On my way, on my way.

2209
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:33,960

2220
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:43,040
I thought, like, I couldn't melee that because, you know, there's a fucking fence on top.

2221
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:46,040
There's, like, a green tarp on it, you know?

2222
01:56:46,300 --> 01:56:48,020
I was like, bro, there's a tarp on it.

2223
01:56:48,100 --> 01:56:49,260
There's no way I can knife that.

2224
01:56:49,660 --> 01:56:50,420
That's a very strong-ass tarp.

2225
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:51,680
You just gotta believe in yourself, Doki.

2226
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:53,460
I did not believe in myself.

2227
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:55,320
You just gotta believe.

2228
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:57,720
Oh!

2229
01:56:58,020 --> 01:56:58,980
Air strike, air strike, air strike!

2230
01:56:59,300 --> 01:56:59,940
That's fine.

2231
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:02,720
I'm in a good place.

2232
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:05,740
Who did do that?

2233
01:57:05,860 --> 01:57:06,140
Oh!

2234
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:07,840
Are you okay?

2235
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:09,980
Yeah.

2236
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:12,700
Wait, where did that airstrike come from?

2237
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:15,640
I don't see anyone.

2238
01:57:17,740 --> 01:57:19,500
Axel, did you airstrike out there?

2239
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:21,240
Nah, nah.

2240
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:24,420
If it's your allies, they'll be green, you know?

2241
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:27,700
You can tell the difference between green and red.

2242
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:29,760
Oh, I didn't see the color.

2243
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:31,000
I don't see color.

2244
01:57:32,140 --> 01:57:32,420
Wow.

2245
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:34,560
So you blind.

2246
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:35,340
Yeah, yeah.

2247
01:57:35,860 --> 01:57:37,000
It's okay, we're all the same.

2248
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:38,520
We're VTubers.

2249
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:39,520
Yeah, exactly.

2250
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:40,520
We're all the same.

2251
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:42,760
You blind, mute, and the death.

2252
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:46,880
I cast a spell where you become blind, mute, and death.

2253
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:49,620
And you lose your limbs.

2254
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:51,740
No, and you lose bones.

2255
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:53,180
Like, I'll...

2256
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:55,580
You can keep your limbs, but I'm gonna take away the bones.

2257
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:57,300
I might as well keep like fucking...

2258
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:58,240
Like, how do I eat?

2259
01:57:59,380 --> 01:57:59,860
You don't.

2260
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:00,940
Like, one of my slimes.

2261
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:02,260
Oh, that's true.

2262
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:02,760
I can be...

2263
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:05,580

They're in the entire tank, Maja.

2267
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:40,100
It's the engineer.

2268
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:43,040

2269
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:44,560
Nice.

2270
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:47,840
Did he get the res off?

2271
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:48,480
I don't know.

2272
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:49,140
Yeah, he did.

2273
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:50,140
Yeah, he did.

2277
01:59:55,620 --> 01:59:56,260
I got sniped.

2278
01:59:56,840 --> 01:59:58,280
West, west, west, across the street.

2279
01:59:58,420 --> 01:59:58,940
I don't care.

2280
01:59:59,000 --> 01:59:59,940
I'm killing this guy.

2281
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:00,600
Oh, on the house.

2282
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:01,740
On the building.

2283
02:00:02,700 --> 02:00:03,080
God.

2284
02:00:03,380 --> 02:00:03,780
Whoa.

2285
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:10,760
I don't see him.

2286
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:13,920
I'm gonna get another angle.

2287
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:15,120
Fuck did he go?

2288
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:19,360
I don't know, but that's a... that's that.

2289
02:00:20,540 --> 02:00:22,400
I'm getting closer to the house.

2290
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:23,820

2291
02:00:23,860 --> 02:00:24,280

02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:35,880

2295
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:36,920

Oh, no.

2299
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:44,940
They just have a sniper rifle that can hit every round, I guess.

2300
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:46,180
I don't know where they are.

2301
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:46,440
I'm here.

2302
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:47,080
I'm safe.

2303
02:01:47,140 --> 02:01:48,040
I'm safe here.

2304
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:49,160
I'm safe here.

2305
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:50,100
Okay.

02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:50,780
Oh, he's one.

2307
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:51,080
He's one.

2308
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:53,300
Can you rescue Mr. NPC?

2309
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:54,120
Please, please.

2310
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:54,680

02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:56,780
Thank you.

2312
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:58,080
I appreciate it.

2313
02:01:59,080 --> 02:01:59,940
Oh, he dropped down.

2314
02:02:00,100 --> 02:02:00,700
He dropped down.

2315
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:01,340
Okay.

2316
02:02:01,480 --> 02:02:01,840
Oh, wait, what?

2317
02:02:09,830 --> 02:02:10,390
He's solo!

2318
02:02:10,710 --> 02:02:11,470
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

2319
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:12,770
Ooh.

2320
02:02:13,070 --> 02:02:14,150
Oh, you made it to us.

2321
02:02:14,370 --> 02:02:15,170
Right below us.

2322
02:02:15,330 --> 02:02:15,870
Oh, they're both.

2323
02:02:15,890 --> 02:02:17,650
Okay, it's fine.

2324
02:02:18,010 --> 02:02:18,270
It's fine.

2325
02:02:19,030 --> 02:02:19,830
It's not fine.

2326
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:21,310
It's not fine.

2327
02:02:21,710 --> 02:02:22,370
It is not fine.

2328
02:02:23,110 --> 02:02:23,330
It is not fine.

2329
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:24,310
It is not fine.

2330
02:02:24,310 --> 02:02:24,750
It is so not fine.

2331
02:02:25,510 --> 02:02:26,290
Oh no.

2332
02:02:27,670 --> 02:02:28,890
What is the zip here?

2333
02:02:30,090 --> 02:02:31,590
Oh my god, bro.

2334
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:34,410
That guy was crazy though.

2335
02:02:34,570 --> 02:02:36,350
He was hitting nasty eyes shots.

2336
02:02:38,050 --> 02:02:38,990
I'm watching him.

2337
02:02:39,650 --> 02:02:41,490
What the fuck is a zip on this building?

2338
02:02:41,710 --> 02:02:41,890
Oh my god.

2339
02:02:42,170 --> 02:02:43,070
Give me a zip line somewhere.

2340
02:02:43,450 --> 02:02:44,470
Wait, he knows his utility.

2341
02:02:44,670 --> 02:02:45,110
Oh, never mind.

2342
02:02:45,210 --> 02:02:45,450
He's dead.

2343
02:02:47,850 --> 02:02:48,650
It's up to you.

2344
02:02:48,950 --> 02:02:49,410
It's up to you.

2345
02:02:49,650 --> 02:02:50,310
It's one guy left.

2346
02:02:50,430 --> 02:02:50,770
It's one guy.

2347
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:51,890
Trust me.

2348
02:02:52,670 --> 02:02:53,370
Axel's serious.

2349
02:02:53,810 --> 02:02:54,530
It's really unfortunate.

2350
02:02:54,790 --> 02:02:55,550
But you're our only hope.

2351
02:02:55,670 --> 02:02:55,950
Oh, wait.

2352

02:07:37,490 --> 02:07:38,370
Millionaires don't do that.

2456
02:07:38,570 --> 02:07:39,490
That's why they're millionaires.

2457
02:07:39,850 --> 02:07:40,910
You don't have to show.

2458
02:07:41,030 --> 02:07:45,530

02:08:33,210 --> 02:08:34,630
On somebody's house.

02:08:35,990 --> 02:08:38,110
Well, I don't think they're living here anymore.

2467
02:08:38,250 --> 02:08:40,610

2468
02:08:43,030 --> 02:08:43,710
MG kit.

02:08:45,410 --> 02:08:46,230

02:09:30,470 --> 02:09:31,870
It's a life act.

2476
02:09:33,050 --> 02:09:33,810
Don't you have morals?

2477
02:09:34,170 --> 02:09:35,350
It's affordable.

2478
02:09:36,530 --> 02:09:38,150
Morals in this economy?

2479
02:09:38,710 --> 02:09:39,230
Hell no.

2480
02:09:39,670 --> 02:09:42,690
We're here to control the rent, you know?

2481
02:09:43,070 --> 02:09:46,770
Making sure that the landlords can't raise the property value.

2482
02:09:47,870 --> 02:09:49,330
And the property is dangerous.

2483
02:09:49,430 --> 02:09:51,010
They can never raise the value.

2484
02:09:51,910 --> 02:09:52,210
True.

2485
02:09:52,710 --> 02:09:53,090
Yeah.

2486
02:09:53,270 --> 02:09:55,670
Just like if there's a death in the lot in the...

2487
02:09:55,670 --> 02:09:56,870
No, I think like...

2488
02:09:56,870 --> 02:09:58,110
You know, I feel like...

2489
02:09:58,510 --> 02:10:10,090
The state agents don't tell you if someone died in your in in the home so you might have like I don't know you might have five generations of murderers who lived there before.

2490
02:10:10,810 --> 02:10:11,090
Yeah, why?

2491
02:10:11,370 --> 02:10:12,030
Show me the house facts.

2492
02:10:12,410 --> 02:10:18,530
Okay, why the fuck would they tell you that someone died in the home if they're trying to sell it, you know, it's not lying.

2493
02:10:19,530 --> 02:10:22,130
They're they're not lying if they're omitting information.

2494
02:10:25,350 --> 02:10:26,710
Why is there a guy here?

2495
02:10:27,590 --> 02:10:28,310
I don't know.

2496
02:10:31,370 --> 02:10:59,050
oh what but he's hurting yeah he's just right over there because the thing is like would you ever ask like a real estate agent like how many people have died in this home like that's not a normal question asked so they don't have to like have you ever asked yeah you would you have sick bastard yeah shinri's interested in that kind of stuff he's looking for a ghost yeah so oh oh that's oh okay Okay.

2497
02:10:59,910 --> 02:11:00,390
Okay.

2498
02:11:01,110 --> 02:11:02,610
I mean, I guess we could like...

2499
02:11:02,610 --> 02:11:03,270
Casually outing out our tower.

2500
02:11:03,770 --> 02:11:03,990
Yeah.

2501
02:11:04,430 --> 02:11:05,650
I'm just like, all right.

2502
02:11:06,290 --> 02:11:07,490
That's neat, I guess.

2503
02:11:08,070 --> 02:11:10,110
Also, I see people where there's two teams.

2504
02:11:10,210 --> 02:11:11,250
There's a full team here.

2505
02:11:12,050 --> 02:11:12,470
We shot.

2506
02:11:12,910 --> 02:11:13,190
What?

2507
02:11:13,750 --> 02:11:15,690
Wait, I have an airdrop or an airstrike.

2508
02:11:16,730 --> 02:11:18,230
This guy has no armor, by the way.

2509
02:11:18,310 --> 02:11:20,510
I'm already at 47 on him.

2510
02:11:23,210 --> 02:11:24,450
Oh my god.

2511
02:11:24,750 --> 02:11:25,750
Oh, they...

2512
02:11:25,750 --> 02:11:26,310

It's a big, it's a big explosion radius, okay.

2519

Okay, okay.

2521
02:11:38,130 --> 02:11:40,190
I got hit by your airstrike.

2522
02:11:41,210 --> 02:11:43,030
Skill issue, skill issue.

2523
02:11:45,430 --> 02:11:47,850
Oh, oh, oh, man, I'm getting shot at now.

2524
02:11:49,150 --> 02:11:49,650
Across at the tree?

02:11:50,570 --> 02:11:51,570
Is it 40, 16?

2526
02:11:53,390 --> 02:11:54,370
It's like, yeah.

2527
02:11:54,810 --> 02:11:55,750
Behind us, behind us, behind us.

2528
02:11:56,010 --> 02:11:56,630
Behind us?

2529
02:11:56,670 --> 02:11:56,790
Okay.

2530
02:12:02,940 --> 02:12:04,220
Yeah, up the hill, up the hill.

2531
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:06,620
Oh, I'm coming over, I'm coming over.

2532
02:12:07,780 --> 02:12:09,080
At the cell phone tower.

2533
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:10,860
Radio tower?

2534
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:11,800
What is that?

2535
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:12,980
Radio tower?

2536
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:14,100
Oil thing?

2537
02:12:15,700 --> 02:12:18,580
No, that's the radio tower, I'm pretty sure.

2538
02:12:19,860 --> 02:12:21,220
I'm slowly walking up this.

2539
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:24,000
Wait, where are you shooting at?

2540
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:27,580
I don't see anyone out there.

2541
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:29,900
They're definitely there.

2542
02:12:30,660 --> 02:12:31,460
Reach line, reach line, reach line!

2543
02:12:31,620 --> 02:12:32,260
Left side, left side, left side!

2544
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:33,240
Oh shit.

2545
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:34,280
Oh shit.

2546
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:35,620
I need a heal.

2547
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:37,180
I knocked someone though.

2548
02:12:37,340 --> 02:12:37,600
I'm hurt.

2549
02:12:37,820 --> 02:12:37,980
I'm not.

2550
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:39,320
I didn't lock someone but like I.

2551
02:12:39,580 --> 02:12:39,980
Oh my gosh.

2552
02:12:40,060 --> 02:12:40,860
I don't have heals.

2553
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:44,260
I'm covering you.

2554
02:12:45,400 --> 02:12:46,120
Oh shit.

2555
02:12:46,260 --> 02:12:47,120
Wait, is there someone behind you?

2556
02:12:47,200 --> 02:12:47,980
Is there someone behind you?

2557
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:49,160
No, we just got hit.

2558
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:49,920
Okay.

2559
02:12:50,160 --> 02:12:51,180
I'm heading over.

2560
02:12:54,380 --> 02:12:55,500
I'm just a little greedy.

2561
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:56,200
Are you safe?

2562
02:12:57,500 --> 02:12:57,820
Yep.

2563
02:12:58,360 --> 02:12:58,900
Safe, safe, safe, safe.

2564
02:13:00,720 --> 02:13:01,520
They're not pushing.

2565
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:14,080
We're good We need to get out of here guys It's a full squad Oh my god, you are crazy How did he not die boss?

2566
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:36,220
Got one, got one, got one It's up to you, it's up to you You're 1 HP and it's up to you Thank you Visa Oh no, oh I'm bled It's okay I have second chance We all have second chance I think So apparently it's like a police officer.

2567
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:38,720
If you ask, they have to disclose, but they don't have to tell you.

2568
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:39,960
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

2569
02:13:40,100 --> 02:13:40,960
They don't have to tell you.

2570
02:13:41,100 --> 02:13:41,660
Are you a police officer?

2571
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:45,180
So they can omit information about murders in the home.

2572
02:13:46,060 --> 02:13:47,320
Because they're trying to sell the home.

2573
02:13:47,480 --> 02:13:49,220
Why the fuck would they tell you?

2574
02:13:52,540 --> 02:13:53,660
Like there's no reason.

2575
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:53,940
It's okay.

2576
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:56,140
I don't think I'll ever own a home, so we'll see.

2577
02:13:56,160 --> 02:13:57,080
Are you kidding me?

2578
02:13:57,200 --> 02:13:58,240
What is up with people?

02:13:58,280 --> 02:14:04,000

I saw a guy literally just walk over there last minute.

2715
02:26:11,500 --> 02:26:12,180
He could have killed him.

2716

2717
02:26:12,900 --> 02:26:13,400
No, no, no.

2718
02:26:13,460 --> 02:26:15,640

02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:18,500

Where do we go?

2725
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:47,400
Oh, definitely not towards the fire.

2726
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:48,980
Let's go northeast.

2727
02:28:49,460 --> 02:28:50,140
First the seal?

2728
02:28:52,700 --> 02:28:53,100
All right.

2729
02:28:54,460 --> 02:28:55,760
I'm following Altair.

2730
02:28:55,960 --> 02:28:58,620
If we die is because of him, he has a bad leadership.

2731
02:28:59,720 --> 02:28:59,800
Woohoo!

2732
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:00,800
I'm a bad leader!

2733
02:29:06,610 --> 02:29:08,530
Follow me guys, we're gonna die!

2734
02:29:10,330 --> 02:29:10,770
Yippee!

2735
02:29:10,770 --> 02:29:11,150
Yippee!

2736
02:29:12,350 --> 02:29:12,790
Finally.

2737
02:29:13,270 --> 02:29:13,930
Oh, okay.

2738
02:29:14,710 --> 02:29:15,570
That's scary.

2739
02:29:16,830 --> 02:29:18,550
We're gonna go towards combat training, actually.

2740
02:29:18,910 --> 02:29:20,130
I feel like, should we loot here?

2741
02:29:20,890 --> 02:29:21,650
Oh, sure.

2742
02:29:22,350 --> 02:29:23,650
I'm getting my knife out.

2743
02:29:24,250 --> 02:29:25,270
I'm shaking the wall.

2744
02:29:25,870 --> 02:29:27,030
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

2745
02:29:27,970 --> 02:29:29,470
Wall has been successfully...

2746
02:29:29,470 --> 02:29:30,490
Oh, they looted this area.

2747
02:29:31,010 --> 02:29:32,870
This area has nothing.

2748
02:29:32,890 --> 02:29:34,450
Leader, you have a guild of six to lead.

2749
02:29:34,690 --> 02:29:35,970
Yeah, but we could always have more.

2750
02:29:36,810 --> 02:29:37,970
Yeah, there's nothing here, though.

2751
02:29:37,970 --> 02:29:38,710
Look, he's a bounty hunter.

2752
02:29:39,010 --> 02:29:39,430
Holy fuck.

2753
02:29:39,650 --> 02:29:40,690
Are you guys okay?

2754
02:29:41,110 --> 02:29:42,150
Wait, wait, where are you getting shot at?

2755
02:29:44,790 --> 02:29:46,150
I'm about to die, yo.

2756
02:29:47,190 --> 02:29:48,370
Where did you get shot at?

2757
02:29:49,050 --> 02:29:49,410
Oh, this.

2758
02:29:49,410 --> 02:29:50,050
I have no idea.

2759
02:29:50,910 --> 02:29:51,310
Helicopter.

2760
02:29:53,650 --> 02:29:53,790
Okay.

2761
02:29:57,110 --> 02:29:58,170
Wait, where are you?

2762
02:29:58,410 --> 02:30:00,090
Up the hill, up the hill, west, hill west, west.

2763
02:30:00,110 --> 02:30:01,610
West, west, west, west.

2764
02:30:05,870 --> 02:30:07,250
I'm looking at the hill.

2765
02:30:07,890 --> 02:30:08,970
This guy just crouching.

2766
02:30:09,750 --> 02:30:53,890

2768
02:31:14,150 --> 02:31:15,090
Let's stop playing this game.

2769
02:31:15,130 --> 02:31:15,830
This game's boring.

2770
02:31:16,510 --> 02:31:19,470
Yeah, what's the point if you can't blow up your friend's legs?

2771
02:31:19,810 --> 02:31:20,670
Like, what the fuck?

2772
02:31:21,790 --> 02:31:22,610
That's what life is all about.

2773
02:31:22,670 --> 02:31:23,110
I know.

2774
02:31:23,570 --> 02:31:25,690
It's about killing your friends and taking away their limbs.

2775
02:31:25,910 --> 02:31:26,110
Exactly!

2776
02:31:26,110 --> 02:31:27,350
I should get your butt cheeks over here.

2777
02:31:27,530 --> 02:31:27,870
Hurry up.

2778
02:31:28,830 --> 02:31:29,230
Exactly.

2779
02:31:29,230 --> 02:31:31,190
Wait, there's an awful lot of people that blew up.

2780
02:31:32,170 --> 02:31:33,470
Um, it's gonna be a while.

2781
02:31:33,590 --> 02:31:34,710
There's still 16 more.

2782
02:31:36,250 --> 02:31:37,690
Should we stay in like the hills?

2783
02:31:38,630 --> 02:31:39,310
Oh, no.

2784
02:31:40,610 --> 02:31:41,410
I'm gonna...

2785
02:31:41,590 --> 02:31:44,230
Fucking, we gotta find better loot, that's for sure.

2786
02:31:44,390 --> 02:31:47,170
Oh, I think someone just, uh, parachuted behind us south.

2787
02:31:47,350 --> 02:31:47,790
Wait, really?

2788
02:31:48,590 --> 02:31:50,390
Yeah, Winfred is- I saw a parachute cut off.

2789
02:31:51,210 --> 02:31:51,550
There he is.

2790
02:31:51,750 --> 02:31:52,410
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2791
02:31:52,630 --> 02:31:53,990
He's peeing someone over there.

2792
02:31:54,330 --> 02:31:55,330
Careful, Axel!

2793
02:31:57,090 --> 02:31:58,690
They're shooting at us!

2794
02:32:01,850 --> 02:32:05,450
I don't know which one was my long scope, but...

2795
02:32:05,450 --> 02:32:07,790
Look at how they're hitting everything, hey.

2796
02:32:08,450 --> 02:32:08,930
Hey!

2797
02:32:09,410 --> 02:32:10,550

I'm serpentine, I'm serpentine.

2801
02:33:19,850 --> 02:33:21,150
There's a small divot right here, small divot.

2802
02:33:22,890 --> 02:33:23,810
Oh, there we go.

2803
02:33:24,270 --> 02:33:25,590
Can't shoot me when I'm in a hole.

2804
02:33:27,830 --> 02:33:29,550
All right, now I can chill.

2805
02:33:29,950 --> 02:33:30,990
Yeah, I can chill right now.

2806
02:33:31,150 --> 02:33:31,470
Whoa.

2807
02:33:32,170 --> 02:33:32,950
We are not in the zone.

2808
02:33:33,270 --> 02:33:33,870
We're relaxed.

2809
02:33:33,990 --> 02:33:34,850
Oh, okay, never mind.

2810
02:33:34,970 --> 02:33:35,610
I guess we don't chill.

2811
02:33:36,430 --> 02:33:37,810
I didn't want to chill anyway.

2812
02:33:37,970 --> 02:33:38,610
I didn't want to chill.

2813
02:33:38,770 --> 02:33:41,030
I'm going to keep bordering the outside right over here on the west side.

2814
02:33:41,470 --> 02:33:42,910
Yeah, that's a good idea.

2815
02:33:43,710 --> 02:33:45,370
Because there shouldn't be anybody from out here.

2816
02:33:47,330 --> 02:33:48,130
I believe.

2817
02:33:51,490 --> 02:33:52,730
Yep, looks pretty safe.

2818
02:33:53,110 --> 02:33:54,470
Yeah, I don't see anyone on the outside.

2819
02:33:55,770 --> 02:33:56,470
Time number five.

2820
02:33:59,870 --> 02:34:00,730
Hello, everybody.

2821
02:34:02,710 --> 02:34:03,110

02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:19,150
Oh, that's not cool.

2830
02:34:19,590 --> 02:34:20,490

That was crazy.

2841

Okay, he knows- they don't know.

2847
02:34:50,150 --> 02:34:53,590
The tank will know I'm in here.

2848
02:34:54,010 --> 02:34:57,030
There's people- there's people in that house right over here as well.

2849
02:34:57,070 --> 02:34:58,810

2854
02:35:07,210 --> 02:35:07,730
Guys!

2855
02:35:14,030 --> 02:35:15,070
It's okay, I'm here too.

2856
02:35:16,170 --> 02:35:16,750
No, it's okay.

2857
02:35:16,910 --> 02:35:18,870
No, you, oh, how about him?

2858
02:35:18,930 --> 02:35:20,250
He feels dead too.

2859
02:35:25,300 --> 02:35:25,740
Altair?

2860
02:35:27,900 --> 02:35:28,340
Altair?

2861
02:35:28,940 --> 02:35:29,780
Oh, I'm getting shot.

2862
02:35:29,880 --> 02:35:30,280
I'm getting shot.

2863
02:35:30,440 --> 02:35:30,620
Whoa.

2864
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:37,280
It's scary outside.

02:35:37,940 --> 02:35:39,360
What the fuck was I watching?

2866
02:35:40,540 --> 02:35:43,260
Bro, Altair, they're all going to fucking come for us now.

2867
02:35:43,420 --> 02:35:44,000
I'm thinking.

2868
02:35:46,540 --> 02:35:48,420
I think it's a glitch to shield.

2869
02:35:48,640 --> 02:35:49,760
I can't pick it up.

2870
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:50,680
Oh, no.

2871
02:35:51,480 --> 02:35:51,900
Oh.

2872
02:35:52,760 --> 02:35:53,560
It's okay.

2873
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:57,020

It's like counteracts.

Guys, for legal reasons, that is a joke.

2918
02:39:03,080 --> 02:39:05,600
Do not mix alcohol and caffeine together.

2919
02:39:05,700 --> 02:39:07,560
I mean, some do, but, like, don't do it.

Not sober at all.

2929
02:39:34,580 --> 02:39:35,900
They named it after Bailey.

2930
02:39:36,020 --> 02:39:37,540
He died drinking too much.

2931
02:39:38,080 --> 02:40:09,620

3010
02:44:47,900 --> 02:44:50,480
I haven't driven a car in like a very long time.

3011
02:44:50,840 --> 02:44:51,460

3012
02:44:51,460 --> 02:44:52,300
Wait, I'm concerned about that.

3013
02:44:55,700 --> 02:44:57,340

02:44:57,340 --> 02:44:58,900

02:48:06,660 --> 02:48:07,800

02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:12,780
Don't worry.

3053
02:48:13,080 --> 02:48:14,060
Don't worry, Axel.

3054
02:48:14,520 --> 02:48:16,760
There's still 21 more teams left.

3055
02:48:17,060 --> 02:48:17,180
Don't worry.

3056
02:48:17,320 --> 02:48:17,800
You're five.

3057
02:48:18,480 --> 02:48:20,080
It's just 21 more teams.

3058
02:48:20,100 --> 02:48:20,740
You're still stuck with us.

3059
02:48:21,280 --> 02:48:21,880
Oh, 69.

3060
02:48:22,220 --> 02:48:22,500
Nice.

3061
02:48:22,940 --> 02:48:25,300
There's 69 players left.

3062
02:48:26,360 --> 02:48:28,160
Oh, people are dying so slow.

3063
02:48:30,060 --> 02:48:30,720
Oh, never mind.

3064
02:48:30,860 --> 02:48:31,280
67.

3065
02:48:31,880 --> 02:48:33,360
Haha, it's like 7.

3066
02:48:36,620 --> 02:48:37,880
Curse you, Doki Bird!

3067
02:48:38,300 --> 02:48:40,100
I'm trying to... I'm testing guns out.

3068
02:48:40,500 --> 02:48:41,380
Okay, we'll grab this.

3069
02:48:42,780 --> 02:48:42,980
Oops.

3070
02:48:46,480 --> 02:48:47,280
The tool.

3071
02:48:48,400 --> 02:48:49,200
Wow, two are you sure.

3072
02:48:50,500 --> 02:48:51,920
I'm just testing the gun out.

3073
02:48:52,960 --> 02:48:54,080
Oh, I know what gun I have.

3074
02:48:54,080 --> 02:48:54,820
I need to do some scouting.

3075
02:48:55,560 --> 02:48:56,020
Top 20!

3076
02:48:56,600 --> 02:48:57,000
Yay!

3077
02:48:58,280 --> 02:48:59,500
I thought it started with 20.

3078
02:49:00,360 --> 02:49:00,660
No.

3079
02:49:01,080 --> 02:49:01,680
It's like 20.

3080
02:49:01,700 --> 02:49:02,220
one.

3081
02:49:06,640 --> 02:49:06,860
Wait.

3082
02:49:07,360 --> 02:49:07,860
Let's see.

3083
02:49:07,860 --> 02:49:08,880
You're so far ahead.

3084
02:49:09,780 --> 02:49:10,300
You're just getting.

3085
02:49:11,020 --> 02:49:11,500
Oh, okay.

3086
02:49:13,940 --> 02:49:14,940
We got this.

3087
02:49:16,820 --> 02:49:18,260
Still at 67, guys.

3088
02:49:18,900 --> 02:49:20,280
They know what they want.

3089
02:49:23,740 --> 02:49:25,300
They want to cringe and die.

3090
02:49:25,560 --> 02:49:25,900
Whoa!

3091
02:49:26,280 --> 02:49:26,700
Wait, what?

3092
02:49:26,740 --> 02:49:27,300
Where are you gonna try to?

3093
02:49:29,560 --> 02:49:30,500
Oh, fuck.

3094
02:49:32,140 --> 02:49:34,000
Oh, my Oh, shit!

3095
02:49:34,320 --> 02:49:35,360
Oh, my God!

3096
02:49:36,700 --> 02:49:43,220
You know, up there, you didn't tell me where you got shot at.

3097
02:49:43,800 --> 02:49:44,740
Well, that's the point of the scout.

3098
02:49:44,880 --> 02:49:45,800
I got shot first.

3099
02:49:46,400 --> 02:49:47,800
I was next.

3100
02:49:48,220 --> 02:49:48,880

3110
02:50:03,360 --> 02:50:05,760

You know what?

3186
02:54:18,240 --> 02:54:19,420
Maybe this is a good place to end.

3187
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:21,100
I think Axel is right.

3188
02:54:22,920 --> 02:54:23,360
Yeah.

02:54:25,200 --> 02:54:57,500
the god i i could hear his voice maybe i'm like ascending too high i'm flying too close to the sun it is 1 a.m apparently everyone's games crashed during that queue so i think i think that was a sign it's a sign i can hear god whispering mees right now you're gonna die soon you're gonna die soon bitch he's telling me what you're just like freedom he doesn't doesn't deserve to suffer anymore.

3191
02:54:57,520 --> 02:54:57,820

Thank God.

3195
02:55:00,860 --> 02:55:02,520
God commands you to play one more.

3196
02:55:05,260 --> 02:55:08,160
I'm an atheist, so I don't believe in God.

3197
