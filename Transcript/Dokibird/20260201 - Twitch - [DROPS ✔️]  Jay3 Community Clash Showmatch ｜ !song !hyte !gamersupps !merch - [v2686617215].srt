1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:17,860
hello I'm back hello I'm back guys probably oh my god okay
it really sucks whenever if I crash in the middle of it cuz

2
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:31,120
then like um it messes with like a lot of shit we're back no
they have two files of the shit that fucking damn it

3
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:55,460
I know I can't no I have two Twitch VODs now God fucking god
damn it I didn't want to have two VODs oh man no the worst

4
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:07,040
part is that it messes with my okay here's a little behind
the scenes insider thing it messes with like average stream

5
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:18,240
CCV for Twitch because like it lowers my average CCV on my
Twitch side so then like it fucks with my entire average too

6
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,360
because like for those who don't know I've talked about this
before but sponsors are based off of your based off of your

7
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:32,580
average CC like how much you're getting paid is based off of
your average CCV overall for a month can you invite your

8
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,860
teammates here for the show match I don't think I have any
of you guys um so then like the fact that i have a 40 minute

9
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:54,680
stream i have a random ass 40 minute stream and it lowers my
average ccv by a lot with the crash my uid i can't nuke it

10
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,120
because it's still there even if you nuke it the the data
still exists

11
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,340
Oh, that's a bill.

12
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,600
God damn it.

13
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,160
All right.

14
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,220
Yeah, when you sent me yours the other day, Craig, I thought
that was your Steam ID.

15
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,060
I ran.

16
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,080
I added some random dude on Steam.

17
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,100
But you get two Twitch streams.

18
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,020
I don't know who it was, but.

19
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,080
At least you guys get two streams.

20
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,960
Does he flats out of them?

21
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:27,940
Yeah.

22
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,320
All right.

23
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,020
It's fine.

24
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,600
I just have to stream a bit longer today.

25
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,500
And we had two games.

26
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,400
So now, yeah, we just had streaming.

27
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:43,720
a little longer today yeah god i hate it when that happens
that's it i'm doing borderless i don't fucking care i don't

28
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:57,140
know why it does that i it's so fucking weird um like it
like it doesn't it's like a risk it happens like once every

29
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:06,400
like like maybe once a month i think uh it's because like my
monitor, my monitor is 500 hertz, but my other two monitors,

30
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:16,020
one is 60 hertz, one is 500 hertz, the one is 200, 244
hertz, and the other one is, uh, 60 hertz.

31
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:29,780
Um, because of that, um, I play the game on 500 hertz on my
main monitor, and, uh, and when I alt tab on full screen,

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,440
Two monitors have to adjust to it as well.

33
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,860
Uh, because I'm going back to...

34
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,840
Yeah, so it's like...

35
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,720
It's so weird.

36
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,320
It's so fucking weird.

37
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,880
I can't...

38
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,140
Yeah.

39
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,600
I can't have...

40
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,540
Because I can't set it all in the same hurts.

41
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,900
That's the thing.

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,760
Wait.

43
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,280
Oh, wait.

44
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,120
We're on this team.

45
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,660
I was like, that's my team.

46
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,600
We're...

47
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,400
We're this team.

48
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,500
But yeah, no.

49
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,360
It's too much.

50
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,420
You're supposed to not set your monitor.

51
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,720
Uh...

52
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,940
you're not supposed to set your other two monitors to like
the same like five like it doesn't even go to 500 hertz

53
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:17,040
anyway but it's apparently not good for your pc if you have
all of them at 500 hertz no the lowest one cat yeah i yeah

54
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,680
so it's not apparently i was told it's not even good to have
all of them set at like a high hurt like um set to the same

55
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:33,880
apparently from what i've heard I hate it when that happens
Especially if I'm on It's okay if I'm YouTube But when it's

56
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,640
on Twitch

57
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,680
God damn it It's bad when it happens on Twitch

58
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,140
Uh Juju thank you for the Twitch Prime Thank you I would
like really love to but I'm currently on like Oh yeah I

60
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,140
A stun lock?

61
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,260
Yeah, I don't know how, but they're giving me 100 lattice,
and they've done it like a million times.

62
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,000
All right, I'm out.

63
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,220
Oh, I wish that was.

64
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:09,860
Oh, no.

65
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,020
I would hate when someone just started giving me tons of
lattice for free.

66
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:14,940
I don't know.

67
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,420
I don't think you understand.

68
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,120
Seriously, what did I say?

69
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,800
What did I say?

70
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,000
Also, I don't know if Sound Guy is alive, right?

71
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,100
Oh, my God, so many voices.

72
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,900
Don't do that.

73
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,160
Oh, my God, there's too many voices.

74
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Don't do it with the cranky.

75
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,300
Don't do that.

76
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,560
There's too many voices in my head right now.

77
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,920
I'm way too tired for this shit.

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,980
I'm way too fucking tired right now to hear all these voices
in my head.

79
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:41,780
Nuclear.

80
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,940
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

81
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:44,520
Thank you.

82
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,340
Thank you.

83
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,480
I can't believe a quick play game took me down.

84
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,240
I knew I should.

85
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,460
Why did I play that quick play game?

86
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,440
God damn it.

87
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,220
I can't believe it.

88
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,840
The quick game, quick play game took me out.

89
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,760
Why did I play it?

90
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,020
Goddamn quick play.

91
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,100
So who's playing Deadpool?

92
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,960
Yeah, what is our team comp?

93
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,320
I don't really know what we're playing here.

94
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,200
I can do it if we need to.

95
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,380
I play a lot of them, but it's up to you.

96
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,740
If someone wants to play them, you can take them.

97
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,720
Isn't Tank Deadpool the best Deadpool version?

98
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,720
I think so.

99
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,900
Yeah, no, no.

100
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,520
I'm not trolling.

101
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,480
Trust me, did God's work on tank.

102
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,140
Yeah, yeah, no, he's fucking insane on Deadpool.

103
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,740
I don't even know what comps work with a solo Deadpool
because both teams have only one tank.

104
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,400
Oh, I can play tank too.

105
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:46,740
It's fine.

106
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,900
Oh, yeah, we didn't.

107
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,860
Are we going to 2-1-3 because we also have three support
players?

108
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,980
They also have three support players.

109
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,780
I would like to play tank if possible, you know.

110
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,360
You get tanked then.

111
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,060
I'll play the pierce.

112
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,660
Thank you so much.

113
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,740
Oh my god, we don't have to play triple support.

114
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:06,780
Where?

115
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,020
I don't know if that...

116
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,140
Oh my god.

117
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,300
We don't have to play triple support, guys.

118
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,420
It's a dream come true.

119
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,180
A 2-2-2?

120
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,640
What is...

121
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,540
In this...

122
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,360
In this day of age?

123
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,900
I'm so fucking... I'm so out of it.

124
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,240
My body does not know today is a stream day.

125
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,760
My body.

126
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,680
My body does not know.

127
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,940
I slept so much.

128
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,900
I think I slept too much.

129
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,100
Toki, please.

130
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,460
It doesn't know.

131
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,000
Who are they missing?

132
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,480
I think that was in Kingsman, though.

133
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,440
Kingsman, yeah.

134
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,240
I think he's stuck in a rank game, I'm pretty sure.

135
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:03,620
Bro.

136
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,220
I'm pulling up the stream.

137
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,960
Queuing a rank game before it's crazy.

138
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,540
Yeah, yeah, he is in a rank game.

139
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,680
It is, it is like one minute left, though.

140
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,120
Oh, okay.

141
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,320
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,640
I assume he was playing rank games.

143
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,220
He's like, I literally, like, looked at it before about it.

144
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,320
my stream started and saw that Kingsman was playing Rink.

145
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:31,860
Yeah, yeah.

146
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,580
Flesh, can you invite me again?

147
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,080
Yeah, yeah.

148
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,100
It served lots of...

149
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,020
Good thing tomorrow is no stream day.

150
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,720
No stream day tomorrow.

151
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,500
Thank God.

152
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,080
Oh, two Doki streams back to back.

153
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,400
Yep.

154
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,460
And it's all rivals.

155
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,380
Yay!

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,240
I'm still...

157
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,440
I'm actually low-key.

158
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:09,720
I'm like, God, fucking it damn it because like here's like a
little behind the scenes uh because like um my twitch

159
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:19,460
streams are like spontaneous on how i feel um i like uh so
it's more so because like you know i i put like i put like

160
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:32,020
random stuff on twitch but my average was lowered a little
bit for uh for uh last month because of that because i like

161
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:38,060
i said it's like all over it's just random depends on like
whatever i'm streaming and no i i like i was a little

162
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:46,840
irritated i was like god damn it why did my pc crash there
uh so like the early access for the deadpool rivals thing i

163
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:57,140
was paid uh less uh because a lot of companies are very
strict on like average ccv uh so i was paid let like less

164
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:03,540
than what i was usually paid for for when i get sponsored to
do early access so i was like okay i can't i can't around

165
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:15,920
yeah i was like okay okay i gotta i gotta stream a little

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,620
Slow down there.

171
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,140
I still need me time, guys.

172
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,600
I still need me.

173
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,940
Yeah, it's messing with my Fortnite pay, guys.

174
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
I don't worry.

175
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,460
Don't worry.

176
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,740
The Marvel Rival Sponsor money goes directly into my
Fortnite skins.

177
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,060
And then, guys, you don't understand.

178
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,040
It affects my Fortnite skin money.

179
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,020
But Toki, think about the Fortnite skins.

180
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,300
I know, that's why I'm so mad.

181
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,420
I'm like, my Fortnite, my V-Bucks pay!

182
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,080
I guess it counteracts.

183
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,220
I need to be able to buy Stitch on Fortnite.

184
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,220
My Fortnite pay.

185
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,370
I actually don't even know.

186
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,450
Okay, guys, how's the audio of everyone?

187
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,650
I'm also, like, super checked out at the moment.

188
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,540
I...

189
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,060
Sound guy out here?

190
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,800
I don't know.

191
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,520
I'm not sure.

192
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,240
I wonder if you do two streams.

193
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,900
Oh, I guess it doesn't count.

194
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,880
I was like, thank you.

195
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,000
You do two streams.

196
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,720
Does it count?

197
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,580
Does it combine into it?

198
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,020
who knows

199
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:47,640
oh we're just waiting right now at this moment we're just
waiting alright you guys here hello yes sir yep we're here

00:12:47,640 --> 00:13:00,440

oh oh wow no bands Let's just rip it.

201
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,720
Let's just go.

202
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,700
The day's shine.

203
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,680
Show them a real show.

204
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,720
It's a show match, right?

205
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,000
We gotta give them a real show.

206
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,480
Yeah, do no bans.

207
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,320
Yeah, yeah.

208
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,800
And then day can play Spider-Man all he wants.

209
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,020
All right.

210
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,840
No bans.

211
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,090
Oh, wait.

212
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:56,890
I was gonna say and this day can play spider-man Wait, all
right, if we wait a minute Hi, wait a minute they what are

213
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:03,110
we're discussing the band style because this is for fun They
said as long as day doesn't play spider-man.

214
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,030
They don't want bands.

215
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,490
Wait if our one trick can't play their his one trick Then
their one trick can't play their one trick.

216
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,790
Oh, I I mean, I you know, you know, Flats, that wasn't a
part of the fine print.

217
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,170
So I think you could play Spider-Man.

218
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,330
I could play Spider-Man, yeah, actually.

219
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,970
As long as you've got a dead, the only rule is there's got
to be a deadpool.

220
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,130
Not true.

221
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,690
All right, if I can't play Spider-Man, Kingsman can't play
magic.

222
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:25,990
Oh!

223
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,450
You know, you can make that rule.

224
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,830
Yeah, that should be a rule.

225
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,350
If I can't play Spider-Man, they can't have a dive
character.

226
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,230
And we can't have a dive character either.

227
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,110
Yeah, yeah, get that working in the chat.

228
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,330
All right, Kingsman.

229
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,330
Just gentlemen.

230
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,650
Okay, okay, sounds good.

231
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,970
I think that should be fair also, what I put in the chat.

232
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:47,950
all right oh yeah moxie can't play hawk guy they can't play
hawk guy like that's if you can't play

233
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,640

234
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:34,690

235
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:37,090
Alright.

236
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,670
Just play with bad.

237
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,850
That's our bad.

238
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,230
This is like...

239
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,570
The verbal bad pick.

240
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,210
Hey, it's not...

241
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,130
There's no contract.

242
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,630
Technically, we could break it.

243
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,030
Never make a verbal contract, guys.

244
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:00,880
Alright.

245
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,380
Can we please...

246
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,360
Let us play the game.

247
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:34,790

Turning up.

252
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,510
What are we waiting on now?

253
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:04,810
The band's still?

254
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,490
I think we're waiting on production.

255
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,730
Alright, let's see.

256
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,390
No, I saw the chat sound guy.

257
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,630
Chat was parodying what you said.

258
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:20,830
No magic or no akai and no spidey or I think guys just
jokes.

259
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,850
I think guys just jokes.

260
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:23,970
Okay.

261
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:24,910
You think so?

262
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,310
I think they were dead I think they were dead serious.

263
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:35,930
all right yeah we just let me okay now i can disassociate
for a second guys i say you play spidey yeah i'm a scammer

264
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,850
you know we can make the deal but i'll still be on
spider-man

265
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:52,990
that's why you never make a verbal contract it's non-binding
true real you'll need a top-notch team to win this one

266
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:03,150
guys make sure that contract is signed we didn't sign
nothing

267
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:22,160
it's actually true verbal contracts um are non-binding only
because nothing is like uh oh they're legally binding yeah

268
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:29,860
but where's your proof that it's verbal unless it's recorded
i guess what the hell unless it's recorded you have proof

269
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:34,020
you fucking had a verbal contract It's gonna follow the
leader.

270
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,520
Wait, if anybody on the team played this match?

271
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,480
30 seconds before.

272
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,680
Yeah, it sucks.

273
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,640
Wait, nope!

274
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,040
Oh my god, wait, no fans!

275
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,320
Camp at Loki is open.

276
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,580
End over with Spider-Man.

277
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,320
Spider-Man, you can't even say that with a straight face.

278
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,560
Oh no.

279
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,380
No, me and Moxie, we're going in the ring.

280
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,420
Yeah, we're going in the ring.

281
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,860
Oh no.

282
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,900
Alright, we have, technically We can play Gambeloki if we
want to be extra scummy.

283
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,180
If you insist.

284
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,520
Oh my!

285
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,140
He's dead.

286
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,330
All right.

287
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,050
I think it's...

288
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,410
Yeah, he went magic!

289
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,070
Like, knew it.

290
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:29,990
It's non-binding.

291
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,130
It's never binding.

292
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,630
He's a...

293
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,050
I gotta look it, I gotta look it.

294
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,840
I need help, yeah.

295
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,940
They're actually running triple.

296
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,680
I fucking knew it when J3 put three supports on both teams.

297
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,840
I knew this was gonna happen.

298
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,460
Yeah, because...

299
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,180
Yeah, because they have three support players.

300
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,300
Oh, yeah.

301
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,240
Oh, my God.

302
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,340
No.

303
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,320
He's one.

304
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,400
Nice and nice.

305
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,560

306
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,500
Very nice.

307
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,540
Someone supports you.

308
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,120
Oh, he knew it.

309
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,020
Maybe having no bans was a bad idea.

310
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,320
Just a maybe.

311
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,420
They say we're freaks.

312
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,900
They're literally running triple.

00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,540

314
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,480

We have two picks.

355
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,300
I got their cloak up.

I hear... There's a Deadpool behind us, by the way.

360
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,080
There's a magic in here.

361
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,840
Moxie Mag won.

362
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,260
He's... Oh, never mind.

363
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,760
He was.

364
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,450
It's not coming for me, is he?

365
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,770
You're so okay.

366
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,450
Oh, I'm dead?

367
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,530

I'm out.

373
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,130
I have luck soon.

374
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,990

I'm okay.

379
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,010
All right.

380
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,750
We're still, I still need a wait.

381
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,290
Okay, you ready?

00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,730

00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,250
Oh, Blaster's so far from me.

384
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:45,230
Oh, shoot.

385
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:45,990
There's so far.

386
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:46,470
Good.

387
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:47,990
Okay.

388
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:48,830
Nice.

389
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,030
Oh, my God.

390
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,870
Oh my God.

391
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:55,550
Oh, you got a day.

392
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,010
Oh, my God.

393
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,090
There's still people behind us.

394
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,730
Oh, I got the point though.

395
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,230
Nice, nice, nice.

396
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,670
Solo cab, solo cab.

397
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,750
They can't get in there in time.

398
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,610
They can't get there in time.

399
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:06,610
You're good.

400
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,010
Yeah, we're good.

401
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,370
Yeah, we're here.

402
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,970
C9, C9.

403
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,630
Easy bait.

404
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,450
C9.

405
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,920
Look at that.

406
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,140
That's embarrassing.

407
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,540
That's the real show.

408
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:24,940
Nice.

409
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,980
Very nice.

410
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:27,500
Oh.

411
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,600
I've never seen third point on this map.

412
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,940
Yeah, you have to like, shit.

413
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,060
You gotta be on like the raft or something.

414
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,520
I don't know.

415
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,840
You gotta be on the raft, right?

416
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:36,720
Yeah.

417
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:37,920
Uh.

418
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

419
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,540
You can, but you don't, you don't push the car if you're in
the middle.

420
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:43,900
Oh, really?

421
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,700
Yeah, apparently.

422
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,020
Oh.

423
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,120
You can't contest it or push, or like do anything when
you're in the middle, but you can, it looks cool.

424
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,320
Sounds strange as head.

425
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,900
Are you gonna copy me here?

426
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,420
Copy me here?

427
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,120
I'm behind you.

428
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,220
I'm trying to see you.

429
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,280
I'm trying to see you.

430
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,520
Yeah, yeah.

431
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,000
There is a...

432
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:22,770
What am I aiming at?

433
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,940
Magic's so low.

434
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,060
You know Lambs?

435
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:31,980
He's going up.

436
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,640
Wait, look at Moga.

437
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,020
Look at Moga.

438
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,560
He's running it down.

439
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,780
Go, go, go!

440
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,140
Dead.

441
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:37,920
Wait, wait.

442
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:38,560
Kill Chloe.

443
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,880
Oh, I'm dead.

444
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,080
Whoa, Moxie really wants to kill us.

445
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,780
I got him.

446
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,460
Three on.

447
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:58,680
Nice.

448
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,780
Is the blue light?

449
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:01,860
What's on?

450
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:02,800
Is it this?

451
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,640
This deserves.

452
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:03,940
Yeah.

453
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,440
See, the blue light is what's on.

454
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,180
Oh.

455
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,820
All right.

456
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:17,420
careful for moxie's hot guys oh shit yeah it is i always i'm
backing up fully

457
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:31,600
i'm fully out oh yeah no no don't worry goodbye lulu yeah we
i knew that moment we were it was no point fighting there

458
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,940
was no point fighting that

459
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,820
I think Hawkeye's left side.

460
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,200
I kind of want to go see what's up there anyways.

461
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,440
Oh, nice.

462
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,900
Alright, we didn't go in.

463
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,820
So where's that gonna happen to us?

464
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,820
Top right is the magic.

465
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,600
Luna is one, got Luna.

466
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,340
Wait, get bogey, get bogey.

467
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,600
He's anti?

468
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,560
He's what?

469
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,760
Wait, that portal's bad.

470
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,200
Let's get three on.

471
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:11,800
That portal's bad.

472
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,620
I can't.

473
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,420
He's in the floaty flats.

474
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:17,960
He's in the floaty.

475
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,900
He's in the floaty.

476
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,280
Oh, does anyone have portal?

477
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:26,620
Oh, I'm dead.

478
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,060
Oh, no, but sorry.

479
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,180
We don't need portal.

480
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,460
We're not that sweaty, guys.

481
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,000
Like a testing guy.

482
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:35,780
Yeah.

483
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,900
That's why I thought we did fantastic.

484
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,800
Yeah, I think we did.

485
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:49,760
pretty well i mean i think we did actually so good like
majority of them are on their mains and we're just having

486
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:59,040
fun except why is nobody else pumped up like me like what's
going on this was amazing we're going bucking we're going

487
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:07,600
bucking against uh shameless yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
anti-dive is a bit shameless but it's okay

488
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,380
No, it's okay.

489
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,420
I mean, they did go triple support.

490
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,380
That's right.

491
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,260
They did.

492
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,100
They did go triple support, guys.

493
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,640
Like, we had to go Loki.

494
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,500
Loki Gambit.

495
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,600
Yeah, they deserve the Loki Gambit when they start off
triple support.

496
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,300
I mean, we got third point.

497
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,100
I did see it was gonna happen.

498
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,600
They have three support players.

499
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,920
We technically do two.

500
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,900
Nine miles away?

501
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,660
What the fuck is this?

502
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,380
It's a bit of a walk.

503
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,380
Yeah, it's an arms race.

504
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,340
I had a feeling.

505
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:52,120
I was like, if there's no bends, if they fuck, I've had a
feeling or go triple support.

506
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,180
Loki Gamb is the only way we can gather it.

507
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:02,980
Like here.

508
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,580
There's...

509
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,340
Yeah, just here.

510
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,300
How about a boost guy up in the air, Flats?

511
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,280
Oh, that's awkward.

512
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,560
That's pretty.

513
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,440
You might need, uh...

514
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,100
There is any magic right here to right behind us.

515
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,700
I got him.

516
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,000
Oh, we don't really have frontline right now.

517
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:42,770
I'm good.

518
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,650
Oh, he's one though, he's one I got.

519
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,190
You might need a shield.

520
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:58,130
Yeah.

521
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,490
You could pull that out too if you guys are inclined.

522
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:00,910
Let me know.

523
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:01,350
Let me know.

524
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:03,810
I think we got it.

525
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,270
I think we're fine.

526
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:04,770
I think we're fine.

527
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:06,450
We got a cragio.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

580
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,160
Now that we have mag, it should be easier.

581
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,420
Because we have a front line where...

582
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,640
That's how I'll be sometimes.

583
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,060

584
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,060

Oh my yes!

670
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:11,670
All we needed was triple support.

671
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,650
I fucking love triple support.

672
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,690
He can never escape.

00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,270
Oh, back in one second.

674
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:21,910
Well, you can tell them if they ask us.

675
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:22,290
Are you ready?

676
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,010
I'll be here.

677
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:23,610
What?

678
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:28,630
God, I was so fucking locked in.

679
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:35,290
I was like, I was so, oh my God.

680
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,930
It's too early for this.

681
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,450
That's all I'm going to say.

682
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,510
It's too fucking early for this.

683
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,150
It's, yeah.

684
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,150
Oh,

00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,010
it's too early.

00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,790
And true.

687
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:00,510
That's why I think maybe we should bring Bans back.

688
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,090
Oh, my God.

689
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,430
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

690
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,530
Maybe we do Bans.

691
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,670
I think they pick MAP.

692
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,010
Yeah, they pick MAP.

693
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,250

704
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,550
playing Triple support

705
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:36,150
gambit the only reason we won that was because we went low
we have a low-key player and we have a gambit player um but

706
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:49,090
i the enemy team doesn't have a low key like doesn't have a
gambit player yeah no fun as god intended yeah i just i had

707
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:58,390
to do triple support last night last night i had to locate
Kevin all we're like at three games man I don't want to get

708
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,750
kicked out

709
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:13,490
oh find a fourth fun show match everyone they should make
everyone play their off roll

710
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,390

00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:42,690

game where everyone plays their off-road

714
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:25,400
there we go yeah hit those supports off of support

715
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:37,950
your support on deadpool

716
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:45,050
Dead pool tank.

717
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,230
There you go.

718
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:54,990
I think everyone playing off-roll would be fun, honestly.

719
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:57,370
All right.

720
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:58,090
Are we all here?

721
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:58,410
Are we ready?

722
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,050
Yeah, we're ready.

00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:02,130
Yeah, I'm ready.

724
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:05,790

725
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:10,410
Do I read that right?

726
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,310
Are we doing an off-roll game?

727
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:20,050
I don't know I feel like I'll say that and then they're
they're just gonna break it like last I think it'd be really

728
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:26,690
fun I think if everyone plays their off roll it'll be a
natural show match I think that's a great idea yeah but like

729
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:39,010
is Doki bird on spider-man okay okay buddy okay I think I
have zero hours on spider-man uh all right yeah off everyone

730
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:45,610
on off roll Support, play, a deadpool of take.

731
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:46,950
All right.

732
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,280
All right.

733
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,340

Are we attack or defense?

738
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,900
We're on attack.

739
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,260
I feel like they're definitely not, if I'm honest.

740
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,700
Okay, we can easily swap off.

741

785
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:36,940

00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,500

790
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,620
Oh shit.

791
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,540

792
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,290
I do not have...

793
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:01,410
Oh.

00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:04,770
I have all here?

795
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:05,670
Is it worth it?

796
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:07,850
Fuck it, let's do it.

797
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,650
It's always worth it.

798
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,920
Oh, the supports are so anti.

799
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,480
Yo, Moxie needs to stop getting gapped.

800
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,160
There's a lock-in.

801
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,540
We do have another gamut all soon.

802
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:31,760
You mean?

803
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:32,400
Thank you.

804
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,760
I got you.

805
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,460
Oh, he's one.

806
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:38,920
He's one?

807
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,700
Wait, we can ult this.

808
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,320
Whatever.

809
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,320
You can ult this whenever.

810
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,680
Actually, we can wait for the cloak.

811
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:02,420
Alright.

812
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,940
They use both support ults.

813
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,060
So they don't have Gambit anymore.

814
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,200
They shouldn't have any Gambit ults.

815
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:15,600
Oh, hey, how you doing?

816
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,050
Oh, I need that, actually.

817
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:29,750
Thank you.

818
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:32,870
Backing out, because he's a Hawkeye ult.

819
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:35,430
Yeah, oh, I'm just...

820
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,170
Oh, I got him, actually.

821
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:36,730
Oh, nice.

822
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:37,890
I have ult soon.

823
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:38,810
Oh, I'm so dead now, though.

824
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:39,070
If you can...

825
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:39,770
Oh, how's your save?

826
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:40,650
You can live.

827
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:49,290
And Malaya, something tells me that Kingsman isn't running
the ones.

828
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:50,490
No, no, no, no, no, no.

829
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:51,230
I don't know what you're talking about.

830
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:56,890
I ain't old this here.

831
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,490
This isn't Kingsman giving me about the ass.

832
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:04,150
Are you guys ready?

833
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:06,450
All right, let's go.

834
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:09,450
Oh, man.

835
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:18,550
I hope you win this 1v1 because he's not 1v1ing you.

836
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:20,270
He's 1v1ing me!

837
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:28,760
But I don't think he respects your challenge.

838
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:45,030
I don't think he's respecting the 1v1.

839
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,030
He ran away from you.

840
00:50:51,950 --> 00:51:08,050

844
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:39,090
Yeah, I'm behind you and want to copy.

845
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,170
I'm letting you heal it.

846
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,570
All right, are you an altus?

847
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:48,830

Oh, I'm dead too.

849
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:03,840

Hey, Cloak.

851
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,160

Oh, that's awkward.

00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,220
Wait, he died, he died!

870
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,100

00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:04,430
He's outside, he's one.

960
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:07,890
I'm backing up from that.

961
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:10,250
He's armed.

962
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:11,170
He's half.

963
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:12,310
He's low.

964
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:13,810
He's not half anymore.

965
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:15,390
I lied.

966
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:15,670

No, yeah.

970
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:20,350
He's getting abused by this.

971
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:24,430
Is Hawkeye still alive or dead?

972
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,770
I don't know, actually.

973
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:29,830
I have a dead pool behind me, by the way.

974
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:32,330
Dead pool behind me, dead behind me, look behind, look
behind, look behind.

He is low.

1037
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,180
He didn't copy me.

01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:52,920
He's 94.

1039
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,280

I'm lucky.

1045
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:08,710

You got to look at me.

1052
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:22,750
We have no supports.

1053
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:24,630
Sorry, I can stall the point guys.

1054
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:27,690
It's like, my God, I think we actually have to go triple
support.

1055
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:32,330
We have to touch point, touch point, touch point.

1056
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:34,450
Okay, that's all we got.

1057
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:35,010
That's all we got.

1058
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:36,590
Final score.

1059
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:37,330
It's a good game.

1060
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:39,830
Wow.

1061
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:43,110
You need triple support to win against triple.

1062
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,070
And also mag because of...

1063
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:48,690
Nox, they give it a rating.

1064
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:49,710
Thank you.

1065
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:51,690
Oh, I have a good stream.

1066
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:54,890
Oh!

1067
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:01,910
I'm just in a show match, by the way.

1068
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:04,730
In a show match.

1069
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:06,030
Okay, okay.

1070
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,210

1073
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:13,790
I don't trust them.

1074
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:14,590
I don't trust.

1075
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:18,510
All of their players are playing their main role.

1076
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:19,970

1077
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:31,610

time even if that's triple support look they didn't respect

right here.

1091
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:51,290

01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:03,870
It is, it is a good Jeff map.

1095
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:04,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1096
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:05,490

Alright.

1098
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:13,910
Four, three, two, one.

1099
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:17,250
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

1100
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:18,970
Gambit never folds.

1101
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,570
I crossed a galaxy for this.

1102
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:23,510
You gotta be kidding me.

1103
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,020
Careful of Hawkeye.

1104
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,060
King's man is one.

1105
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:36,940
He's actually one.

1106
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,620
King's man is running.

1107
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,150
You're in the bubble?

1108
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:45,770
Got you.

1109
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:49,310
Bomb one.

1110
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:55,000
Are you okay?

1111
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:57,580
Moxie has no cooldowns.

1112
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,260
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

1113
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:02,060
Really?

1114
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,860
We got a magic in our spawn?

1115
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:06,520
That's nice.

1116
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:07,800
We're even, we're even.

1117
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:09,960
We are missing one support though.

1118
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:10,280
Oh, no.

1119
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,360

01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:18,200
Do we have TP?

1230
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:18,860
Do we have TP?

1231
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:21,720
I'm on it.

1232
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:22,600
I think we did.

1233
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:23,180
I can touch.

1234
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,840
I can touch for a bit.

1235
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,820
I think it might need rocket or club or maybe rocket.

1236
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:32,300
We can win.

1237
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,960
We need third portal.

1238
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:45,690
We just can't.

1239
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,910
We just can't pick because we don't have a shield.

1240
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:47,590
We just can't peek because we don't have a shield.

1241
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:48,610
We don't technically don't have a shield tank.

1242
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:51,150
Gambit got more than one ace up his sleeve.

1243
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:51,790
Can't win.

1244
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:52,910
That's true.

1245
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:55,130
That best way.

1246
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:57,430
We do have Rocket, though, so it's easier to heal.

1247
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:02,350
I can go Groot.

1248
01:15:02,690 --> 01:15:03,470
I hate this.

1249
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:06,570
I hate this because we can't peek.

1250
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:07,230
They can peek.

1251
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:10,570
I think if I just get on him and stick to him, he'll just...

1252
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:10,830
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1253
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:11,690
Just wall him off.

1254
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:12,510
Can't shoot anybody.

1255
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:16,330
That'll work.

1256
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:18,530
Nah, I like the Thorpec.

1257
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:19,330
I like the Thorpec.

1258
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:21,770
It's because of the dance.

1259
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:22,190
Is it?

1260
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:23,450
Is it because of the dance?

1261
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:25,170
This one's the match.

1262
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:26,750
I want to, like, dance, buddy.

1263
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:30,030
I got this, though.

1264
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:33,610
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

1265
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:34,490
You got it?

1266
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:37,450
I should have asked for beds.

1267
01:15:39,170 --> 01:15:42,550
See, even in the third game, he didn't do off-roll, guys.

1268
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:45,050
He was just getting a lot.

1269
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:49,310
Careful, Hawkeye.

1270
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:50,490
Go on the right side.

1271
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:57,790
We don't really have anything for that.

1272
01:15:58,790 --> 01:15:59,710
I'm just going back up.

1273
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:01,590
I'm kiting out.

1274
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:02,630
I'm kiting out.

1275
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:05,790
We have a looking copy.

1276
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:08,630
Yeah, I'm just dead.

1277
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:10,550
We just, we got it too late, though.

1278
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:12,010
Man, I'm still on the point.

1279
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:18,080
They captured the mission area.

1280
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:24,140
We can copy here.

1281
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:25,180
Oh, wait.

1282
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1283
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,300
Oh, Loki's not here.

1284
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,360
Look, Loki's not here.

1285
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,400
I'm coming.

1286
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:32,420
All got close.

1287
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:32,940
I'll go close.

1288
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,220
I'm waiting for your Loki.

1289
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,060
Thank you so much.

1290
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,020
I really appreciate that.

1291
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:39,360
No.

1292
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:40,580
Oh.

1293
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:42,520
Oh, I just got him.

1294
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:43,560
Getting ganked in the back.

1295
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,400
I don't...

1296
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,260
Oh, it was too far.

1297
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:47,800
It was too far.

1298
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:54,760
He's on stretch.

1299
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:55,140
He's on stretch.

1300
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:55,180
He's on stretch.

1301
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,820
I also have an alt, too, by the way.

1302
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:58,600
Oh,

1303
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:02,820
I see.

1304
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:03,320
I didn't alt.

1305
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:06,880
Alt and the booger.

1306
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,540
I'm alt and the booger.

1307
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:08,960
Nice, nice.

1308
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:10,760
They're TP'd.

1309
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:16,420
I feel like I'm playing an actual tournament right now at
this.

1310
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:20,300
Dude, we win this or no?

1311
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,180
Do we win this or no?

1312
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,340
Did no one tell you that this is actually tournament part
two?

1313
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:25,180
Yeah, I'm like, I'm...

1314
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,480
They actually team beat!

1315
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:28,460
Oh, you look so weird.

1316
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:29,560
Oh, there you go.

Oh, we got a third.

One of them.

1351
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:50,710
There's a swarm in here.

1352
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:54,030
You still have your real game later, but for real money!

1353
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:56,590
I'm all warmed up now!

1354
01:18:58,550 --> 01:18:59,130
Yo, this guy's warm.

1355
01:18:59,150 --> 01:18:59,970
Someone swapped a gambit.

1356
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:01,350
Someone who can play gambit.

1357
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:03,370
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

1358
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:09,110

1364
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:49,530
Yeah, we saw it for a while.

1365
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:50,070
Damn.

1366
01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:55,490
Guys, I think we should have had bans, guys.

1367
01:19:56,170 --> 01:20:00,550
I think it was a little foolish of us to say no bans.

1368
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,540
I'm not going to say it.

1369
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:10,380
I was going to say it.

1370
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,240
No honor.

1371
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:18,500
No honor.

1372
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:19,940
I don't think the vibes were in.

1373
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:29,880
guys i just think we did we didn't have a low key or yeah
like i was the only low key or gambit player well ggs was

1374
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:46,340
fun good luck for the real tournament games all right good
luck with the real turn of ggs bye-bye well i think like our

1375
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:55,460
team was definitely the vibe team because we were play for
fun characters so obviously we gave a lot of like points to

1376
01:20:55,460 --> 01:21:02,100
them we gave a lot of like actual we gave them a lot of
space and distance because we're fucking around every time

1377
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:15,000
we start with fucking around and then and then because of
they all were on their main so obviously yeah yeah and we

1378
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:25,240
were we never portaled we never we the fight the first time
we portal oh yeah you got me the first time we portal was

1379
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:28,840
the last the very last game yeah

1380
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:48,250
insane sweat i mean they started out with triple i knew they
were gonna start out with triple support first yeah yeah it

1381
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:56,270
was it is what it is i wanted us to try hard but like
everyone everyone wanted they wanted to have fun they wanted

1382
01:21:56,270 --> 01:22:04,050
to play like random characters and uh and then it was like i
don't guys i don't think they're respecting that guys i i

1383
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:15,770
don't think and in our team i think like only me only i knew
loki and gambit because um only i knew loki and gambit

1384
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:24,550
because like um i had to play loki or i have to play gambit
for us there it sucked because i had all like i had no

1385
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:39,280
gambit to copy i was just like where's the gambit like where
is yeah they started by being on spider-man kingsman and

1386
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:52,400
moxie kingsman was on magic we were like we were like all
right kingsman not on magic yeah and then they were on

1387
01:22:52,400 --> 01:23:01,880
triple support too we were on dual support and then on the
second game we were like off roll we will do off roll

1388
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:16,890
we were like off roll on second game and then they didn't go
off roll and we went off roll second game and then third

1389
01:23:16,890 --> 01:23:29,050
game because you guys said boker thought it was going to be
third game off roll off roll third game so weird so it was

1390
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:43,950
just like it just felt like i just i was just all over the
place my brain is just too tired my brain was way my brain

1391
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:47,950
was way too tired to do triple support

1392
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:56,770
I was like, they're portaling.

1393
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:58,510
I was just like, really?

1394
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:02,950
They're actually fucking portaling.

1395
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,230
Like, they're doing tournament strats.

1396
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:06,370
Yeah.

1397
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:10,550
No, that's why I was like, bro, you gotta play triple
support.

1398
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:12,410
They're not gonna respect you, man.

1399
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:14,810
They're not gonna respect the 1v1.

1400
01:24:14,990 --> 01:24:16,230
You gotta rip it.

1401
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:18,930
Like, they already broke the rule.

1402
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:27,430
I was like, I swear to God, if anyone was getting paid to be
in the show match, swear to god i i i got here for i was

1403
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:48,730
here i did this for free i i was

1404
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:54,570
like i had

1405
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:02,660
to try my Raid, Malaya, thank you.

1406
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,100
Oh my god, I'm tired.

1407
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:08,720
Sunday was...

1408
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:24,600
I think to improve this, if it was done again, if this was
done again, I think they should have more rules for the show

1409
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:25,060
match.

1410
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:30,780
Like, to be more, I guess, more enforcement.

1411
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,920
on what it was gonna be.

1412
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:45,360
Yeah, actual silly rules instead of just Deadpool only
because people were not on the same page.

1413
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:51,320
I think like both teams with the players were not on the
same page.

1414
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:53,160
And I felt really bad for Flats.

1415
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:58,500
I felt really bad for Flats only because like he had to do a
real turn.

1416
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:07,300
Like his, you know, he thought it was to be for like for fun
where he gets to relax in between game um where he was gonna

1417
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:20,260
relax in between games but then he had to think and actually
try really hard um in in the show match or we were gonna

1418
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:29,760
just get like absolutely rolled yeah we were gonna get
absolutely rolled all of us did not try like no he's been

1419
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:39,420
he's been on on for like four like what five plus hours yeah
well to be fair i had a feeling it was going to be triple

1420
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:46,300
support because technically both our teams are triple
support we have three support players on both teams So it

1421
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:49,360
was like, it was like an inside job.

1422
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:59,120
I, I, yeah, it was like an inside job because, because both
teams have only like, like technically peer support players.

1423
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:04,980
It's like, so like J3 planted three supports on each team.

1424
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,500
Like literally planted three supports on each team.

1425
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:21,050
So it was like, unless like one of the support off rolls,
all the, the three players there, all, play support yeah

1426
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:31,410
yeah yes i'm literally sweating for free and i i don't like
complaining but like i feel bad complaining but i'm so tired

1427
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:47,350
like my team my team's energy was so like i i my team's
energy was so fucking dead like i know you guys noticed it I

1428
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:52,450
don't know if you guys noticed it, but I felt like my entire
team was so fucking dead.

1429
01:27:53,010 --> 01:27:56,790
Like, because we had to, my, we had to try so hard.

1430
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:06,810
Yeah.

1431
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,250
I had to speed.

1432
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:12,690
I had, oh my god.

1433
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:14,530
Well, it's because, like, Flats.

1434
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:18,210
Well, it was just Flats, but Flats was in, it's still in the
tournament.

1435
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:21,710
Yeah.

1436
01:28:22,270 --> 01:28:28,670
i think like if it was a show match it definitely should
have there should have been like funny rules or something

1437
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:36,590
and like because we were not on the same page we were i
thought no bands as in like we get to fuck around we get to

1438
01:28:36,590 --> 01:28:44,950
we got we get to fuck around more with like team comps and
stuff more so like oh off-roll stuff blah blah and

1439
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:55,930
everything but play triple and then as i was like guys we
gotta pull up triple support we're never gonna win we're

1440
01:28:55,930 --> 01:29:03,110
never gonna win the alt rotation and we didn't have a mag
player our mag player was stuck on Deadpool duty

1441
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:14,050
like flats was our is is the mag player but like cranky
technically could go mag but like he was doing so much on

1442
01:29:14,050 --> 01:29:21,350
thor so we literally had no shield tank for a hot guy and
that's just ggs that's why i was like guys can we please

1443
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:29,390
have him back the supports are not having fun yeah because
like the front line doesn't know how not fun we were having

1444
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:37,070
because we literally cannot peek yeah because i was like
guys please i really need a shield tank like the supports

1445
01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:44,710
back here are not having fun with the positioning because i
know like i think like malaya and lulu were not used to

1446
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:50,670
playing against a really good hawk at but i'm used to
playing against a really good hot guy and like literally

1447
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:58,730
literally when that's why I was like guys don't peek don't
peek and you can tell and you can tell like I didn't like

1448
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:04,690
you know they were they were like careful like like you know
they didn't have to live through the life I had to live

1449
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:11,810
through so you know what I'm saying they didn't have to live
through the life I had to live through playing against those

1450
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:19,670
types of hot guys um so they're like what do you mean you
know because they assume the hot guy doesn't their shots but

1451
01:30:19,670 --> 01:30:27,470
it's moxie so i knew like i'm not fucking peaking that and
they they still have their whimsy and their joy and they

1452
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:36,310
don't know that if they peak uh they were just gonna die
instantly you know i was playing super careful and then like

1453
01:30:36,310 --> 01:30:49,210
when i see like um i see like lulu and Milaya's like, guys,
please don't look out and just stay where you are.

1454
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:51,270
We don't have a shield.

1455
01:30:51,830 --> 01:30:57,170
I was literally playing the fucking most cautious game ever
because we had no shield.

1456
01:30:57,590 --> 01:31:04,530
It was like the scariest shit when you don't have a fucking
shield tank against a fucking Hawkeye.

1457
01:31:06,130 --> 01:31:07,670
It was so scary.

1458
01:31:08,530 --> 01:31:18,890
To be thinking for the twitch prime thank you think i fell
for it again why does this keep happening i just realized i

1459
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:25,250
fell for it again i just promised this was a fun show match

1460
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:36,050
wait gavin never falls i fell every time

1461
01:31:39,090 --> 01:31:43,290
Were they at least having fun try-harding against us?

1462
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:45,550
Who did the enemy team at least?

1463
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:48,110
Because I don't think my team had fun.

1464
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:52,090
I don't think...

1465
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:57,490
Did they have fun winning?

1466
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:05,730
Oh my god.

1467
01:32:05,870 --> 01:32:08,550
And then they were like, yeah, you're running Gambit Loki.

1468
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:11,370
You're running triple support!

1469
01:32:21,950 --> 01:32:26,250
I hope they have- I hope they had a lot of fun winning.

1470
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:27,830
I'm so tired right now.

1471
01:32:28,570 --> 01:32:29,670
There's just no winning.

1472
01:32:30,030 --> 01:32:36,290
Like, they're like, yes, we ran Gambit Loki, but we also
went double support.

1473
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:42,330
but because it's triple support is still stronger it's still
worse than gambit loki

1474
01:32:46,330 --> 01:33:01,670
yeah yeah but we had they we had like like we also have weak
players too we also have weak players as well and we had to

1475
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:11,270
go against dive we had to go against magic dive as well And
magic dive against weaker players is not it's not fun too

1476
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:22,070
like we have to also because like they have a dive character
We have a dive character, but we went double support Yeah,

1477
01:33:22,110 --> 01:33:31,590
we went double support we didn't run triple So it's like we
should have went I I I I should not have said no bands.

1478
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:32,930
I should have said bands

1479
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:37,550
Yeah.

1480
01:33:39,050 --> 01:33:40,510
I don't know why.

1481
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:45,770
I thought we could have a fun, I thought we could have fun
ha ha moments.

1482
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:48,710
I really did.

1483
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:55,030
Moments before disaster.

1484
01:33:55,650 --> 01:33:56,390
No demands!

1485
01:33:58,330 --> 01:34:00,610
There was no honor code.

1486
01:34:01,150 --> 01:34:05,110
There really wasn't an honor code at all.

1487
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:10,810
My faith in humanity, I lost my trust.

1488
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:13,530
Oh, I hope people watching had fun watching.

1489
01:34:13,670 --> 01:34:15,130
It felt like watching a real game.

1490
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:16,890
Let's lose Celestial 2.

1491
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:17,750
I might as well.

1492
01:34:17,970 --> 01:34:18,530
I'm tired.

1493
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:24,130
Let's just go in and lose Celestial 2 while we're at it.

1494
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:29,250
I hope the viewers had fun.

1495
01:34:30,030 --> 01:34:32,430
I'm bad in Gambit first no matter what.

1496
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:34,930
I do not want to play Gambit right now.

1497
01:34:36,290 --> 01:34:38,110
too tired for Gambit.

1498
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:43,030
I'm way too tired.

1499
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:52,980
Here we go.

1500
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:56,540

I'm banning Gambit.

1504
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:11,840
There's no way.

1505
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:13,100
I swear to God.

1506
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:18,920

Yeah, I'm but truly never for it.

1514
01:36:55,050 --> 01:37:00,750
Maybe this was an inside job by J3.

1515
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:05,230
Weakened Flats before his final game.

1516
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:10,450
Make him weaker.

1517
01:37:12,030 --> 01:37:13,490
It's an...

1518
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:23,070
it's an inside job he planted three supports on both teams
said no bad agreed to no fans and then fucking destroyed

1519
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:33,330
flats mental I swear it's an it's an inside job is it why
would he do that to him why I'm tired after that I did one

1520
01:37:33,330 --> 01:37:48,690

1521
01:37:48,690 --> 01:37:49,910

01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:06,330
like to have a shield tank.

1524
01:38:10,110 --> 01:38:13,590
Many on attack and he's our only tank.

1525
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:15,070
Don't forget that.

1526
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:18,930
Oh, man.

1527
01:38:19,390 --> 01:38:20,050
There we go.

1528
01:38:21,070 --> 01:38:23,110
I don't think we're gonna...

1529
01:38:23,110 --> 01:38:25,570
This does not look winnable.

1530
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:29,850
See, this is the team I had versus the team they had.

1531
01:38:30,230 --> 01:38:31,410
This is...

1532
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:35,910
literally what it was like for us.

1533
01:38:40,570 --> 01:38:41,910
This is literally what it was like.

1534
01:38:48,230 --> 01:38:49,710
Are they gonna be okay?

1535
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:50,570
No.

1536
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:57,570
This is literally, this was, this was literally how the show
match was like, guys.

1537
01:39:01,630 --> 01:39:03,750
Literally actually how the show match.

1538
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:12,290
Their team has like a real cap and then And my team is Penny
on attack.

1539
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,220
Oh my god.

1540
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:22,620
We're doing it.

1541
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:23,800
Oh.

1542
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:24,560
Oh.

1543
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:28,620
I deserve that.

1544
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:29,320
Oh my god.

1545
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,060
And they wasted Poirot!

1546
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:32,040
Oh.

1547
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:38,140
Let's fucking go.

1548
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:43,700
I deserve this.

1549
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,140
It capped the point, though.

1550
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:52,880
Alright, nice.

1551
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:54,560
Oh my god, please let me through.

1552
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,080
I'm just a little rodent.

1553
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,640
Just a humble little rat.

1554
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,840
If it worked, it worked.

1555
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,520
Oh, goodbye, Venom.

1556
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:11,280
It's so loud.

1557
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:13,820
We have invis.

1558
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:19,300
This is literally the Wild West right now.

1559
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:23,740
Yeah.

1560
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:26,440
I am good.

1561
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:28,800
Shields up!

1562
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:32,220
Shields up!

1563
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:35,700
What's going on?

1564
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:38,320
Oh.

1565
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:39,840
Is he fine?

1566
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:40,700
He'll be fine.

1567
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:42,300
That is stereo.

1568
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:44,900
That takes care of Namor.

1569
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:49,340
Yeah, solo tank is bulk.

1570
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:51,860
You see, you can never reason with a one trick.

1571
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:56,040
Does this work?

1572
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:57,000
Oh, it does.

1573
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:02,540
There's no reason when it comes to one tricking.

1574
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:05,100
There's only a...

1575
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,860
No other character exists for them.

1576
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:14,400
Oh, shit!

1577
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:17,180
What the fuck?

1578
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:19,460
Where did he come from?

1579
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,280
Oh my god, that freak!

1580
01:41:22,820 --> 01:41:24,320
Go back to your team!

1581
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:26,860
Oh shit, is that karma?

1582
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:33,540
Oh shit, karma, that's real?

1583
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:40,960
Karma's actually real?

1584
01:41:45,210 --> 01:41:47,410
Oh man, I'm just gonna reset.

1585
01:41:47,690 --> 01:41:49,250
Fuck that is what I learned.

1586
01:41:50,550 --> 01:41:53,750
What are you going to do when we just all run away?

1587
01:41:55,650 --> 01:41:57,350
Honestly, what can you do?

1588
01:41:58,630 --> 01:41:59,390
Catch it!

1589
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:01,830
Alright, here we go.

1590
01:42:02,410 --> 01:42:03,310
I got this.

1591
01:42:08,370 --> 01:42:09,750
Okay, I...

1592
01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:14,550
I thought there'd be more people up front, but I did not.

1593
01:42:15,450 --> 01:42:16,550
I don't know.

1594
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:21,210
I used it for our bucket but I thought there would be more
people up.

1595
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:23,350
I did not realize they backed up that much.

1596
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:25,730
All right, we have Invis up.

1597
01:42:27,830 --> 01:42:28,750
No, no, no, no.

1598
01:42:28,910 --> 01:42:29,670

Oh, never mind.

1604
01:42:38,830 --> 01:42:41,070
I was gonna say that was a good-ass bubble, but...

1605
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:43,750
They really didn't do anything much from it.

1606
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:49,590
Holy shit.

01:42:51,650 --> 01:42:59,550

That was our mag.

1639
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:25,800

01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,400

01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:33,670

Disappear.

1693
01:51:34,540 --> 01:51:34,780
Hmm.

1694
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:39,840
This is real fire.

1695
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,260
Where is my team?

1696
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:43,740
My curse of Doki.

1697
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:45,300

Our penny.

1702
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:10,800
I swear to God, our penny is.

1703
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:25,320
This guy's fucked up because our penny decided to play for
his life like if our penny didn't play for his life we would

1704
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:33,520
win this hit it again again

1705
01:52:36,810 --> 01:52:55,490
again that actually is crazy no way Penny is the sleeper
agent.

1706
01:52:55,790 --> 01:52:56,590
There is no way.

1707
01:52:57,950 --> 01:52:59,390
What the fuck?

1708
01:53:01,850 --> 01:53:03,390
Oh, that is unfortunate.

1709
01:53:04,530 --> 01:53:06,270
Well, at least he gets a second chance.

1710
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:11,980
Do we kill the...

1711
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:13,420
The name more, apparently?

1712
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:14,780
That's there as well?

1713
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:23,920
I will be up front.

1714
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:25,120
I personally don't know.

1715
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:35,480
like it when um people chat in the middle of games like that
only because it it's just like you know there's just stream

1716
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:46,920
sniping as the game is going on because that just makes it
more obvious i will say that it's fine if they do it like

1717
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:56,540
after the game but for me it's like bro that's pretty
obvious you're watching this yeah yeah i'll pat you on me

1718
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:06,160
it's just more so of like oh my god the fight was over the
fucking fight was over that's my bad i wasn't paying

1719
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:23,780
attention i wasn't paying that that's on me that's on me
that's on me sorry i didn't even realize That was on me.

1720
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:27,760
That was the one thing I fucking did wrong.

1721
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:34,060
The one thing I did wrong out of the entire game.

1722
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:38,900
That was going to cost us a lot.

1723
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:43,360
It's not like, you know.

1724
01:54:55,710 --> 01:54:57,210
It's not like, you know.

1725
01:54:58,050 --> 01:55:02,230
My entire team was like fucking around too.

1726
01:55:07,110 --> 01:55:10,570
Was like playing the fucking game of their lives here as
well.

1727
01:55:23,450 --> 01:55:26,730
Yeah, not shifting it to me when like...

1728
01:55:29,070 --> 01:55:33,730
Not shifting it to me after like the entire game.

1729
01:55:34,330 --> 01:55:39,250
People were like, people were like fucking going off and
everything.

1730
01:55:40,910 --> 01:55:48,830
Well, it's just like, yeah, yeah, not like Penny running,
running off.

1731
01:55:51,970 --> 01:55:58,190
Not like Penny running off, like, the point two times in a
row.

1732
01:55:58,750 --> 01:56:03,710
And then they're like, oh, Rocket fucked up that up.

1733
01:56:04,210 --> 01:56:07,870
And not like we just watch multiple DPS players.

1734
01:56:08,450 --> 01:56:11,330
And also we were only taking.

1735
01:56:18,070 --> 01:56:28,050
we were only doing that we were frontline only penny tank
but oh i fuck up that else that's because i was talking

1736
01:56:28,050 --> 01:56:32,530
about stream etiquette i'm just doing something real quick
that had to

1737
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:49,160
uh uh but it was just more so stream etiquette it's just um
it's it's it's just weird to like like check the stream mid

1738
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:55,960
game and then making it known that you are because it is
technically stream sniping and like it's just a little weird

1739
01:56:55,960 --> 01:57:05,500
for me for that for that so it's just more so like i'm okay
if people are doing like after the game is like after the

1740
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:12,620
game is over but sort of like making it known you're like
looking at the stream while the game is like happening at

1741
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:13,500
the same time

1742
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:28,090
me distracted because I was just like yeah like I don't like
obviously people will stream snip but it's like it's a

1743
01:57:28,090 --> 01:57:37,170
little it got a little awkward because it was like it got
really awkward yeah but it's through more so like you can

1744
01:57:37,170 --> 01:57:43,550
also see like the hero comps you see the hero comps what
we're playing and everything too um since we are running

1745
01:57:43,550 --> 01:57:49,830
defense as well so it's like I know like you were not stream
sniping but i was just saying like stream etiquette i would

1746
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:56,590
prefer if like because it is like other people could also
report that as well because it's like considered like

1747
01:57:56,590 --> 01:58:04,230
against um it's like sort of like against like like it's
like not like a thing so it's more so like it was like a

1748
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:13,970
general overall you see me in game you do see me game um
just say like you know if you're on the enemy team it's more

1749
01:58:13,970 --> 01:58:24,390
so like at the end of the game yeah because other people
could also report as well because I obviously I know like

1750
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:33,130
you don't have any intentions for that but it's just more so
like a general overall thing for everybody because it's

1751
01:58:33,130 --> 01:58:38,370
considered like bad etiquette in terms of like when you're
playing a competitive game it's why like Valorant players

1752
01:58:38,370 --> 01:58:49,770
right now Valorant players they all put um um it's also like
don't don't valentine players they have to play on streamer

1753
01:58:49,770 --> 01:58:55,530
mode now they i mean they have to play it with delay on and
map overlay and everything they a lot of like like

1754
01:58:55,530 --> 01:59:00,250
competitive valentine players they play with stream delay on
because even they're like oh i want to like you know pull up

1755
01:59:00,250 --> 01:59:04,810
recognize like pull up stream and stuff like that like for
them it's more so like you know they get like super paranoid

1756
01:59:04,810 --> 01:59:10,330
and stuff like that um for me yeah i do play this And it is,
like, reportable in Valorant as well.

1757
01:59:10,850 --> 01:59:11,390
Type deal.

1758
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:14,730
It is reportable in Valorant.

1759
01:59:19,450 --> 01:59:19,790
Yeah.

1760
01:59:20,370 --> 01:59:25,190
And also, I have, like, trauma from Apex as well, because I
got StreamSnipe.

1761
01:59:25,870 --> 01:59:29,850
I got StreamSnipe a lot for Rankin Apex.

1762
01:59:31,230 --> 01:59:32,170
Like, cheaters.

1763
01:59:32,690 --> 01:59:36,270
Apparently, if you guys didn't remember, um...

1764
01:59:36,970 --> 01:59:39,530
If you guys didn't remember, uh...

1765
01:59:40,270 --> 01:59:47,630
When we did our Predigran in Apex, I was told by my friends,
like when the people I was queuing with at that time, and we

1766
01:59:47,630 --> 01:59:54,190
kept dying, not like, when we kept getting chased by hacker
squads, we were apparently being streamed tonight by several

1767
01:59:54,190 --> 01:59:58,410
hacker squads to prevent us from ranking up.

1768
01:59:59,490 --> 02:00:00,930
Because I was streaming those games.

1769
02:00:01,910 --> 02:00:12,430
I was apparently being, yeah, they like, afterwards, like,
they had to report to, like, yay about it um and like

1770
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:19,950
obviously they had they got banned after my stream but like
we i was getting the stream sniped non-stop by hacker squads

1771
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:32,990
during apex grinds oh yeah sorry i queued up another one i
want my celestia too back and or i derank yeah there were

1772
02:00:32,990 --> 02:00:39,250
like two to three i remember because i was like really
pissed off about it um i was really mad about it because I

1773
02:00:39,250 --> 02:00:40,470
was just like, what the fuck?

1774
02:00:43,430 --> 02:00:44,410
All right, one more.

1775
02:00:49,350 --> 02:00:50,150
One more.

1776
02:00:50,510 --> 02:00:52,170
I promise this is one more.

1777
02:00:52,410 --> 02:00:54,370
I was throwing off my vibe.

1778
02:00:55,650 --> 02:00:58,110
You always, I promise this is one more.

1779
02:01:00,510 --> 02:01:00,970
For real.

1780
02:01:15,930 --> 02:01:18,010
You'll need a top-notch team to win this.

1781
02:01:18,010 --> 02:01:20,670
I don't know, I guess, oh shit, I tapped him.

1782
02:01:21,090 --> 02:01:22,610
I didn't realize I was tabbed up.

1783
02:01:22,790 --> 02:01:23,130
I don't know what I mean.

1784
02:01:23,210 --> 02:01:23,870
I don't want to play.

1785
02:01:24,290 --> 02:01:25,350
I don't think it's as horrible.

1786
02:01:26,370 --> 02:01:26,850
I agree.

1787
02:01:27,070 --> 02:01:27,590
Our pun, I'm sure.

1788
02:01:27,790 --> 02:01:29,030
He said Loki.

1789
02:01:31,770 --> 02:01:32,130
Um.

1790
02:01:33,070 --> 02:01:34,530
Dude, you think Puma tier one's up?

1791
02:01:34,750 --> 02:01:34,890
Thank you.

1792
02:01:34,930 --> 02:01:35,510
Thank you.

1793
02:01:36,070 --> 02:01:37,910
Oh, I'm reporting you for that.

1794
02:01:39,490 --> 02:01:40,010
What is that?

1795
02:01:40,090 --> 02:01:44,970
But yeah, like, that's why it's like, that's why for me,
it's like, it's just awkward when, like, better and better.

1796
02:01:46,950 --> 02:01:49,430
Because if it's on my team, that's fine.

1797
02:01:52,790 --> 02:01:55,830
That's fine, like, cause you know, you see what I see.

1798
02:01:56,570 --> 02:01:59,390
If you're on my team and you're in my game, you see what I
see.

1799
02:01:59,530 --> 02:02:05,490
If you're on the enemy team and you make it known you're
watching the stream, I'm like, that's weird.

1800
02:02:09,710 --> 02:02:10,230
That's weird.

1801
02:02:11,570 --> 02:02:16,010
Because I know, yeah, in my game, you know, other people
would do, like, oh, man, God, abandoning.

1802
02:02:16,250 --> 02:02:18,610
Like, what's the point of having streamer mode?

1803
02:02:20,870 --> 02:02:22,050
We should just surrender, bro.

1804
02:02:22,270 --> 02:02:22,970
We have this Punisher.

1805
02:02:23,270 --> 02:02:23,750
We're not waiting.

1806
02:02:24,970 --> 02:02:26,230
The battle starts in five.

1807
02:02:26,950 --> 02:02:30,150
Four, three, two, one.

1808
02:02:31,650 --> 02:02:32,390
Blood your head's a lot.

1809
02:02:32,570 --> 02:02:33,030
I'm bruised.

1810
02:02:36,510 --> 02:02:37,090
Angles grounded.

1811
02:02:38,930 --> 02:02:39,790
I pushed her down.

1812
02:02:40,410 --> 02:02:40,750
Grotted.

1813
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:41,670
All right.

1814
02:02:45,590 --> 02:02:46,650
That's right, blood.

1815
02:02:47,030 --> 02:02:48,870
Oh, my God.

1816
02:02:49,370 --> 02:02:50,250

You got it.

1831
02:04:19,990 --> 02:04:22,310
We can pull me off the map, bro.

1832
02:04:22,410 --> 02:04:23,130
I don't know about you.

1833
02:04:24,030 --> 02:04:25,090
I'm dead, bro.

1834
02:04:25,090 --> 02:04:27,390
Bro, he can't pull anybody off.

1835
02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:30,590
I just realized he can't pull anyone.

1836
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:33,590
It's okay.

1837
02:04:33,810 --> 02:04:34,650
I can get hot ground.

1838
02:04:35,270 --> 02:04:36,290
Oh my god.

1839
02:04:36,510 --> 02:04:38,490

02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:18,760
You know, Arloki fucked up there.

1929
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:19,600
That wasn't on me.

1930
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:21,580
That...

1931
02:10:21,580 --> 02:10:26,780
I need you to know that Arloki messed up there, not me.

It's winnable.

1943
02:11:26,670 --> 02:11:28,730
We just need our tanks to get a grip.

1944
02:11:29,470 --> 02:11:29,990
Round two.

1945
02:11:30,370 --> 02:11:30,590

phoenix is a dps player and she said like her main rule

1950
02:11:59,710 --> 02:12:03,190

1951
02:12:03,930 --> 02:12:05,210
All right, I got a list of something.

1952
02:12:05,770 --> 02:12:07,270
I was like, keep looking up.

1953
02:12:09,130 --> 02:12:11,750
I got a work message to have to look at.

1954
02:12:13,110 --> 02:12:14,250
All right, here we go.

1955
02:12:16,770 --> 02:12:18,270
Oh my god, I hear a hawk.

1956
02:12:18,430 --> 02:12:20,030
I know what that means.

1957
02:12:21,870 --> 02:12:23,390
You know what that means.

1958
02:12:23,730 --> 02:12:30,610
You know what that means?

1959
02:12:33,130 --> 02:12:35,590
I heard a hawk guy.

1960
02:12:42,530 --> 02:12:44,170
I got him!

1961
02:12:44,650 --> 02:12:45,470
I got him.

1962
02:12:45,670 --> 02:12:46,590
I don't know how.

1963
02:12:47,230 --> 02:12:48,310
But I got him.

1964
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:57,160
Oh, goodbye, Mag.

1965
02:12:57,160 --> 02:12:59,200
You're alone up there.

1966
02:13:00,160 --> 02:13:01,600
Holy shit.

1967
02:13:02,260 --> 02:13:07,140
I hear a side lock.

1968
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:08,820
out of it.

1969
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:12,640
Holy shit.

1970
02:13:13,380 --> 02:13:14,500
Oh my god.

1971
02:13:17,120 --> 02:13:18,900
Guys, I'm being avoidable.

1972
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:22,560
I think that we can't use her still hitting hard.

1973
02:13:25,380 --> 02:13:28,980
We can't use her still hitting hard.

1974
02:13:29,700 --> 02:13:30,720
We'll never know.

1975
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,220
Oh, how did they get to...

1976
02:13:34,220 --> 02:13:35,920
I was able to build her.

1977
02:13:36,020 --> 02:13:36,520
Oh, goodbye.

1978
02:13:37,180 --> 02:13:37,660
Oh.

1979
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:39,800
It's okay.

1980
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:40,660
I have my altitude.

1981
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:41,820
It's okay.

1982
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:42,280
Here we go.

1983
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:43,420
Here we go.

1984
02:13:43,460 --> 02:13:43,820
Let's go.

1985
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:44,960
It's my turn.

1986
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:47,360
There we go.

1987
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:47,560

1992
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:03,820

Honestly maybe my team healing wasn't the best though.

2046
02:19:43,850 --> 02:19:48,690
I will admit, my team might have been struggling with
healing.

02:19:50,210 --> 02:19:51,190
But not me.

2048
02:19:51,390 --> 02:20:00,990

02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:18,280
It's from the old file.

2303
02:41:18,420 --> 02:41:19,280

02:43:07,070 --> 02:43:10,090
I don't think saving it as a draft does anything.

2315
02:43:11,710 --> 02:43:14,950
It still says incompatible audio codec, so I'm...

2316

2399
02:50:36,560 --> 02:50:37,820
Second win time.

2400
02:50:38,660 --> 02:50:40,980
We gotta take this energy somewhere.

2401
02:50:41,440 --> 02:50:42,860
Now we have so much energy.

2402
02:50:44,180 --> 02:50:45,860
We gotta take it here.

2403
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:50,900
Aren't you all pumped, guys?

2404
02:50:51,300 --> 02:50:52,780
We're all so pumped.

2405
02:50:53,260 --> 02:50:54,620
We hit our second win.

2406
02:50:58,220 --> 02:50:59,200
Someone's average.

2407
02:50:59,360 --> 02:50:59,620
It's okay.

2408
02:50:59,920 --> 02:51:01,360
See, I know what will cheer you up.

2409
02:51:01,560 --> 02:51:03,620
We're gonna have some motivation real quick.

2410
02:51:04,340 --> 02:51:05,220
There we go.

2411
02:51:05,860 --> 02:51:08,260
Let's get that motivation in, guys.

2412
02:51:08,520 --> 02:51:09,900
I don't see you flossing.

2413
02:51:12,320 --> 02:51:12,800
Come on.

2414
02:51:13,060 --> 02:51:14,300
Where's the energy?

2415
02:51:16,420 --> 02:51:18,420
You convinced me.

2416
02:51:19,720 --> 02:51:20,900
Come on, guys.

2417
02:51:21,140 --> 02:51:21,880
Let's go.

2418
02:51:22,100 --> 02:51:23,740
Where's the fucking energy?

2419
02:51:24,260 --> 02:51:25,840
I don't see no flossing.

2420
02:51:30,700 --> 02:51:31,540
Is this good?

2421
02:51:31,580 --> 02:51:32,660
Yes, it will.

2422
02:51:32,900 --> 02:51:34,920
It's gonna help me with my 40 minute bot.

2423
02:51:35,120 --> 02:51:36,560
I gotta fix that.

2424
02:51:36,900 --> 02:51:37,380
Alright.

2425
02:51:41,900 --> 02:51:43,700
Bump, bump, bump.

2426
02:51:44,420 --> 02:51:47,880
Alright, where are they at anyway in the...

2427
02:51:47,880 --> 02:51:49,000

2428
02:51:49,060 --> 02:51:50,460
He deserves...

2429
02:51:50,460 --> 02:51:51,340
Oh, they are!

2430
02:51:51,500 --> 02:51:52,660
Wait, they're 3-0ing!

2431
02:51:53,960 --> 02:51:57,640
Wait, is that... Oh my god, they just need two more games.

2432
02:52:01,480 --> 02:52:02,940
They just need two more.

2433
02:52:03,520 --> 02:52:03,560
Nice.

2434
02:52:04,780 --> 02:52:06,200

2435
02:52:06,680 --> 02:52:07,600
The enemy team?

02:52:16,980 --> 02:52:18,460
Yeah, Flask team is winning.

2439
02:52:19,080 --> 02:52:22,260
The enemy, I recognize the enemy team has Moofin.

2440
02:52:23,080 --> 02:52:25,180
If you know Overrush, you know who he is.

2441
02:52:36,800 --> 02:52:37,900
Alright, here we go.

2442
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:42,660

They abandoned it.

2468
02:54:53,800 --> 02:54:55,060
It's all fair game.

2469
02:54:56,660 --> 02:54:57,040

Alright, I pulled him a little closer.

2476
02:55:51,630 --> 02:55:52,910

He's fine.

2479
02:56:00,210 --> 02:56:01,650
It's okay, we're so healthy.

2480
02:56:02,990 --> 02:56:03,970
We're so healthy.

2481
02:56:04,510 --> 02:56:06,570
They don't have a Black Panther anymore.

2482
02:56:09,290 --> 02:56:10,630
Everything is okay.

2483
02:56:13,770 --> 02:56:15,230
Oh, he's dead.

2484
02:56:18,580 --> 02:56:19,280

02:56:20,360 --> 02:56:20,820
There we go.

2486
02:56:21,520 --> 02:56:23,900
We got the...

2487
02:56:23,900 --> 02:56:25,300
See, everything should be fine.

2488
02:56:28,880 --> 02:56:29,560
See, look at that.

2489
02:56:30,680 --> 02:56:33,560
As long as nobody is flanking us, we should be good.

2490
02:56:37,630 --> 02:56:38,610
Oh my god.

2491
02:56:38,990 --> 02:56:40,510
Oh my god, somebody was flanking us.

2492
02:56:40,790 --> 02:56:41,450
Oh my god.

2493
02:56:44,390 --> 02:56:44,950

2494
02:56:46,810 --> 02:56:47,670

2495
02:56:48,610 --> 02:56:53,250
Oh no, oh no, no!

2496
02:56:58,830 --> 02:57:01,770

I got my old.

2500
02:57:12,570 --> 02:57:14,130
There's still a chance to stop them.

2501
02:57:14,610 --> 02:57:15,530
We're gonna have to touch though.

2502
02:57:21,890 --> 02:57:25,670

Okay, we can't even get out of this whole hole here.

2516
02:59:28,140 --> 02:59:28,460
Alright.

2517
02:59:30,820 --> 02:59:33,200
We don't have anything for this, by the way.

2518
02:59:34,140 --> 02:59:35,640
Like, actually, nothing for this.

2519
02:59:39,160 --> 02:59:41,420
Yeah, I think we need one of the DPS to go tank.

2520
02:59:41,600 --> 02:59:42,840
I can hold frontline here.

2521
02:59:47,440 --> 02:59:49,420
Alright, um, I have...

2522
02:59:49,420 --> 02:59:50,920
Jeff, you had all to get!

2523
02:59:53,900 --> 03:00:07,980
I will say that's crazy that all the terrorists are on my
team including myself I will say I will say it's crazy that

2524
03:00:07,980 --> 03:00:10,450
I the terrorists are all it's like

We do have one that Jeff, that I hope that we will get
something out of.

2527
03:00:58,810 --> 03:00:59,250
What?

2528
03:01:01,410 --> 03:01:02,250
That's crazy.

2529
03:01:03,030 --> 03:01:04,150
He actually hit the headshot.

2530
03:01:04,410 --> 03:01:06,130
Can we get out of Jet Warrior and get another...

2531
03:01:06,130 --> 03:01:07,150
Oh my god, I was 1 HP.

2532
03:01:07,470 --> 03:01:08,950
I didn't even realize I was 1 HP.

2533
03:01:09,730 --> 03:01:11,110
Our Jeff is...

2534
03:01:11,110 --> 03:01:11,350
Jeff...

2535
03:01:11,350 --> 03:01:11,730
Like, what?

2536
03:01:12,750 --> 03:01:13,610
They're like...

2537
03:01:13,610 --> 03:01:14,630
Get us out of another life.

2538
03:01:14,690 --> 03:01:16,370
You know, like, you can keep us alive, you know?

2539
03:01:16,470 --> 03:01:16,970
You don't...

2540
03:01:16,990 --> 03:01:27,450
give much heal and you bolted twice and they haven't been
good yeah no we we didn't need that i wasn't gonna kill him

2541
03:01:27,450 --> 03:01:37,450
on iron fist because i blocked his team i saved our invoice
question mark yeah that's i mean you only i was gonna kill

2542
03:01:37,450 --> 03:01:44,190
that i was gonna put the support out no we're still gonna
kill the strange because that was one old right you bolted

2543
03:01:44,190 --> 03:01:51,910
one time the entire time well because i couldn't i will say
she is in the wrong for playing jeff when we are not triple

2544
03:01:51,910 --> 03:02:01,290
support and not dive it doesn't matter also the fact that we
were not we do not have enough defensive you cannot defend

2545
03:02:01,290 --> 03:02:09,450
that be honest with you we just got out dps 10 to 1 and then
we made we had solo we first a solo tank and then got out

2546
03:02:09,450 --> 03:02:18,990
dps i will say that there was no reason to play jeff when we
do not have enough No, I actually have...

2547
03:02:20,610 --> 03:02:26,190
That's not it because Jeff definitely does more healing per
second than any other healer on the on the team and they

2548
03:02:26,190 --> 03:02:28,390
didn't went off of these defenseables.

2549
03:02:28,850 --> 03:02:31,550
They won off of our DPS getting out DPS two to three DPS.

2550
03:02:32,910 --> 03:02:35,290
He does have a good point.

2551
03:02:35,790 --> 03:02:37,230
He does also have a good point.

2552
03:02:37,450 --> 03:02:39,370
Our DPS is pretty ass right now.

2553
03:02:39,370 --> 03:02:39,890
Yeah, look at the end.

2554
03:02:40,070 --> 03:02:41,670
Watch what the deal is.

2555
03:02:42,150 --> 03:02:43,510
And we didn't do it because of defenseables.

2556
03:02:43,630 --> 03:02:45,750
I will say he does have a point.

2557
03:02:46,050 --> 03:02:48,670
Our DPS also Our entire team's just ass.

2558
03:02:50,770 --> 03:02:51,930
We can all be right.

2559
03:02:52,510 --> 03:02:53,630
We can all be right.

2560
03:02:53,970 --> 03:02:55,750
This entire team is just our best.

2561
03:02:56,490 --> 03:02:58,430
We can all be right, guys.

2562
03:02:59,690 --> 03:03:01,410
It's not one or the other.

2563
03:03:01,650 --> 03:03:02,530
We can all be right.

2564
03:03:02,950 --> 03:03:05,250
We can all be here making mistakes.

2565
03:03:06,770 --> 03:03:07,590
See, two times.

2566
03:03:08,230 --> 03:03:10,290
They literally, what's it, two times in the first point?

2567
03:03:11,090 --> 03:03:12,590
No, I think you're just saying stuff now.

2568
03:03:13,050 --> 03:03:13,450
What?

2569
03:03:13,790 --> 03:03:14,010
Yo.

2570
03:03:17,990 --> 03:03:22,990

2571
03:03:26,930 --> 03:03:34,100

2577
03:04:22,440 --> 03:04:25,540
Because nobody else in my team is killing anything.

2578
03:04:27,640 --> 03:04:30,940
I'm just like, no one's killing anything.

2579
03:04:31,180 --> 03:04:32,420
I want to kill him.

2580
03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:34,540
I want to be that killer.

2581
03:04:37,980 --> 03:04:38,580
Hello.

2582
03:04:39,840 --> 03:04:40,380
Alright.

2583
03:04:41,560 --> 03:04:43,520
Yeah, I think it's a team dip, guys.

2584
03:04:44,780 --> 03:04:45,800
I really...

2585
03:04:45,800 --> 03:04:46,020
Oh!

2586
03:04:46,800 --> 03:04:47,300
Oh!

2587
03:04:52,020 --> 03:04:52,180
Oh!

2588
03:04:52,760 --> 03:04:54,000
Why did you...

2589
03:05:07,540 --> 03:05:09,380
All right.

2590
03:05:11,060 --> 03:05:12,100
What's going on?

2591
03:05:12,840 --> 03:05:13,680
I got...

2592
03:05:13,680 --> 03:05:15,580
I got left to die.

2593
03:05:15,940 --> 03:05:16,780
Leftward dead.

2594
03:05:17,280 --> 03:05:21,300
It truly was a leftward dead moment right there.

2595
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:26,220
Why if it was a leftward dead moment?

2596
03:05:30,180 --> 03:05:30,960
What the...

2597
03:05:31,160 --> 03:05:34,840
Fuck why did he say Chinese dude?

2598
03:05:35,940 --> 03:05:36,700
Oh,

2599
03:05:40,640 --> 03:05:42,540
I hope we're doing something with that.

2600
03:05:43,380 --> 03:05:44,380
We are!

2601
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:55,360
Fuck me, August.

2602
03:05:57,660 --> 03:05:59,820
Look at what happened.

2603
03:05:59,960 --> 03:06:01,080
You let me to...

2604
03:06:01,600 --> 03:06:03,100
Fuck me, August.

2605
03:06:08,840 --> 03:06:11,040
Where's the other support?

2606
03:06:14,980 --> 03:06:17,980
Just our usual tunnel visions.

2607
03:06:18,200 --> 03:06:20,040
Yeah, the wall stopped their emerald, which would have aced
us.

2608
03:06:20,400 --> 03:06:22,080
So it was a sacrifice that needed to happen.

2609
03:06:31,430 --> 03:06:33,030
I mean, I pulled him back.

2610
03:06:33,130 --> 03:06:36,170
I did something for myself, my team.

2611
03:06:37,450 --> 03:06:38,750
The final 10 seconds.

2612
03:06:44,390 --> 03:06:45,990
Guys, sometimes...

2613
03:06:47,550 --> 03:06:49,510
Man, I would...

2614
03:06:57,570 --> 03:06:59,550
I don't even know who to avoid.

2615
03:06:59,810 --> 03:07:02,190
My entire team was pretty bad.

2616
03:07:06,370 --> 03:07:10,130
I support, but who will support me?

2617
03:07:11,030 --> 03:07:13,230
Who will support me?

2618
03:07:14,090 --> 03:07:15,930
Dude, that's a good idea.

2619
03:07:16,230 --> 03:07:20,010
That was just, I was like, I don't, I don't know.

2620
03:07:20,310 --> 03:07:25,390
That entire, I want to be out of this entire lobby.

2621
03:07:26,450 --> 03:07:29,630
I'm going to go clobber some kids real quick in the
clobbering club.

2622
03:07:31,650 --> 03:07:33,970
I literally do cute.

2623
03:07:34,190 --> 03:07:34,590
It's all right.

2624
03:07:34,690 --> 03:07:35,450
We have Saturday.

2625
03:07:35,650 --> 03:07:37,070
We have Saturday, guys.

2626
03:07:38,370 --> 03:07:42,510
Just remember, we got Saturday to look forward to.

2627
03:07:43,430 --> 03:07:46,010
Like, it's okay.

2628
03:07:46,230 --> 03:07:48,430
Just think about Saturday, guys.

2629
03:07:48,710 --> 03:07:51,450
Think about how great Saturday's gonna be.

2630
03:07:52,650 --> 03:07:53,790
Oh my god, there's the bouncer.

2631
03:07:54,650 --> 03:07:56,130
There's natural bouncer.

2632
03:08:00,630 --> 03:08:02,250
Alright, here we go.

2633
03:08:04,730 --> 03:08:07,650
Man, it's gonna make Saturday feel so good after.

2634
03:08:08,590 --> 03:08:09,690
Just remember that.

2635
03:08:11,090 --> 03:08:12,810
Saturday's gonna feel so good.

2636
03:08:14,070 --> 03:08:15,070
An eternity?

2637
03:08:16,750 --> 03:08:17,950
Eternity console?

2638
03:08:18,850 --> 03:08:20,050
Oh my god.

2639
03:08:20,250 --> 03:08:21,730
I've never seen that before.

2640
03:08:24,970 --> 03:08:27,670
I wonder if matchmaking is slow or fast on console.

2641
03:08:27,930 --> 03:08:28,850
Oh, I want to challenge you.

2642
03:08:30,830 --> 03:08:34,550
I wonder how fast or slow matchmaking is.

2643
03:08:44,090 --> 03:08:45,450
Alright, here I'm ready.

2654
03:10:50,010 --> 03:10:51,210
New meta.

2655
03:10:51,870 --> 03:10:53,270
New meta.

2656
03:10:54,230 --> 03:11:00,330
Oh my god, I didn't realize I've this was built like that.

2657
03:11:02,010 --> 03:11:04,870
I forgot I've just get healed.

2658
03:11:05,510 --> 03:11:07,110
It truly was forever.

2659
03:11:08,590 --> 03:11:10,370
Oh my god, they have the meta.

2660
03:11:10,670 --> 03:11:12,690
They actually have the fucking...

2661
03:11:12,690 --> 03:11:15,430
Final round starting now.

2662
03:11:19,140 --> 03:11:21,020
You wish you were this cool.

2663
03:11:22,160 --> 03:11:23,000
Plushie power!

2664
03:11:25,340 --> 03:11:25,740
Alright.

2665
03:11:26,340 --> 03:11:27,980
We both have self-healed up.

2666
03:11:32,880 --> 03:11:34,120
This is crazy.

2667
03:11:34,380 --> 03:11:36,060
This is actually pretty fucked up.

2668
03:11:36,240 --> 03:11:37,240
Do you think about it?

2669
03:11:38,700 --> 03:11:40,600
He's so smart, too.

2670
03:11:43,320 --> 03:11:44,780
Look, he just sells you.

2671
03:11:48,640 --> 03:11:49,920
He's like...

2672
03:11:49,920 --> 03:11:51,500
You can't handle the Q.

2673
03:11:54,650 --> 03:11:56,490
It's just all, like, self-heal.

2674
03:12:06,070 --> 03:12:07,070
Oh my god, wait.

2675
03:12:17,360 --> 03:12:18,300
Wait, what?

2676
03:12:19,720 --> 03:12:20,160
What?

2677
03:12:21,320 --> 03:12:23,320
I didn't even realize that.

2678
03:12:24,500 --> 03:12:26,780
Wait, there's, there's, like, healed?

2679
03:12:27,320 --> 03:12:28,920
Oh my god, never had a match.

2680
03:12:29,260 --> 03:12:30,540
Fucking, there's time out.

2681
03:12:30,720 --> 03:12:33,240
There's, no, it wasn't even stopped healing.

2682
03:12:33,380 --> 03:12:34,860
It's, it's like, the heals.

2683
03:12:34,980 --> 03:12:37,260
the heals, like, decreased.

2684
03:12:37,360 --> 03:12:38,680
She didn't even hit me.

2685
03:12:38,880 --> 03:12:46,560
She didn't, I lost, she didn't even hit me, but she can
still get healed by her fucking Invis wall.

2686
03:12:46,860 --> 03:12:47,120
Yeah.

2687
03:12:48,980 --> 03:12:49,900
That's crazy.

2688
03:12:50,020 --> 03:12:51,740
I didn't even realize that existed.

2689
03:12:53,580 --> 03:12:56,000
No, she had heals with the Invis wall.

2690
03:12:56,240 --> 03:12:56,440
All right.

2691
03:12:56,520 --> 03:12:58,320
No, I think that's the side.

2692
03:12:58,780 --> 03:12:59,460
That's the side.

2693
03:12:59,500 --> 03:13:01,720
I realized what the, that's the side.

2694
03:13:01,820 --> 03:13:03,440
This guy's been dueling for so long.

2695
03:13:03,500 --> 03:13:04,800
They know the matchup.

2696
03:13:04,980 --> 03:13:06,420
They fucking know...

2697
03:13:07,860 --> 03:13:09,480
That's the sign.

2698
03:13:10,280 --> 03:13:13,340
They fucking know, like, the dual meta.

2699
03:13:13,460 --> 03:13:17,960
I was like, I never thought about, like, Iron Fist.

2700
03:13:20,740 --> 03:13:22,820
They know the cheese.

2701
03:13:23,340 --> 03:13:24,360
No, they weren't silver.

2702
03:13:24,440 --> 03:13:25,680
They were, like, unranked.

2703
03:13:25,880 --> 03:13:27,740
They've never really played it yet.

2704
03:13:29,740 --> 03:13:30,980
Jeez, that's it.

2705
03:13:30,980 --> 03:13:32,140
I know the strat now.

2706
03:13:33,100 --> 03:13:34,120
I know the strat.

2707
03:13:34,980 --> 03:13:47,400
that what an invis i know the matchup now all right so the
strat you know what fuck it so the strat is we do we do loki

2708
03:13:47,400 --> 03:13:58,020
and then arm fist or hide in the corner with invis yeah
that's actually crazy i'm figuring out the dual mat meta

2709
03:13:58,020 --> 03:14:07,980
every loss is a learning experience It's Loki, Anvis, Invis.

2710
03:14:10,020 --> 03:14:10,860
This is the meta.

2711
03:14:12,920 --> 03:14:14,190
Oh shit, this is a real guy.

2712
03:14:15,760 --> 03:14:20,260
No, they top every loss is a learning experience.

2713
03:14:22,600 --> 03:14:28,460
Damage over time is crazy because like, she's could still
heal with her fucking thing.

2714
03:14:29,060 --> 03:14:30,380
I wasn't expecting that.

2715
03:14:37,770 --> 03:14:38,350
Oh!

2716
03:14:41,290 --> 03:14:43,010
Nope, not the right one!

2717
03:14:44,030 --> 03:14:45,610
Not the right one, unfortunately.

2718
03:14:53,870 --> 03:14:55,330
Not the right one, unfortunately!

2719
03:14:57,030 --> 03:14:57,730
Time to vanish!

2720
03:14:57,890 --> 03:14:58,950
Not the right one.

2721
03:15:05,370 --> 03:15:07,530
Not the right one, unfortunately!

2722
03:15:22,460 --> 03:15:25,740
The only issue is I've never played Iron Fist before.

2723
03:15:27,380 --> 03:15:30,000
I've never played Saga tries to.

2724
03:15:33,540 --> 03:15:35,460
Loki is so broken.

2725
03:15:36,060 --> 03:15:36,360
Duel.

2726
03:15:38,600 --> 03:15:39,220
It really is.

2727
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:40,580
Oh, he knows.

2728
03:15:40,840 --> 03:15:42,320
I think Shark wins this.

2729
03:15:42,560 --> 03:15:43,400
I'm pretty sure.

2730
03:15:50,440 --> 03:15:52,200
I am pretty sure.

2731
03:15:58,600 --> 03:16:00,780
I think Shark wins this.

2732
03:16:01,020 --> 03:16:02,080
This dog.

2733
03:16:04,400 --> 03:16:05,660
I'm pretty sure, right?

2734
03:16:13,240 --> 03:16:15,060
Yeah, this isn't it.

2735
03:16:15,360 --> 03:16:16,480
This is a shark angle.

2736
03:16:20,590 --> 03:16:22,070
I'm pretty sure, right?

2737
03:16:26,860 --> 03:16:29,260
Like we both have infinite heals.

2738
03:16:38,530 --> 03:16:41,350
Yeah, and then it's sudden death.

2739
03:16:41,450 --> 03:16:43,110
Who has more HP me or him?

2740
03:16:44,950 --> 03:16:46,290
Because I don't know.

2741
03:16:53,800 --> 03:16:55,180
Oh wait, he does.

2742
03:16:55,660 --> 03:16:56,740
Wait, he wins this.

2743
03:16:57,080 --> 03:16:57,400
No.

2744
03:16:58,160 --> 03:16:58,600
Isn't he?

2745
03:16:59,100 --> 03:16:59,960
No, I win it!

2746
03:17:00,160 --> 03:17:00,720
2 HP!

2747
03:17:13,640 --> 03:17:15,500
We both tried it.

2748
03:17:16,660 --> 03:17:20,100
No, it's so broken because I'm still getting healed.

2749
03:17:20,760 --> 03:17:23,680
I'm still getting healed while it was...

2750
03:17:23,680 --> 03:17:25,460
Like, what's it called?

2751
03:17:27,840 --> 03:17:31,620
I'm still getting healed while it was, like, death match.

2752
03:17:31,900 --> 03:17:32,240
Yeah.

2753
03:17:32,860 --> 03:17:34,700
That shit is so broken.

2754
03:17:35,020 --> 03:17:36,140
What the fuck?

2755
03:17:36,580 --> 03:17:37,720
It was this guy, right?

2756
03:17:38,820 --> 03:17:40,820
I want to see what Bozzy...

2757
03:17:46,840 --> 03:17:48,940
He had to fucking stop...

2758
03:17:48,940 --> 03:17:49,380
No.

2759
03:17:50,520 --> 03:17:51,640
No rematch.

2760
03:17:51,880 --> 03:17:53,260
I think I dodged the kill.

2761
03:17:56,640 --> 03:17:58,720
I think I dodged it.

2762
03:17:59,940 --> 03:18:01,880
That is so...

2763
03:18:01,880 --> 03:18:03,480
Oh, man.

2764
03:18:04,940 --> 03:18:07,240
No, now there's gonna be dual medas.

2765
03:18:07,520 --> 03:18:09,360
Oh, it's just support versus...

2766
03:18:09,360 --> 03:18:11,380
It's just support and out of this.

2767
03:18:11,720 --> 03:18:19,200
It's like you have to like characters that self-heal and
Arampus was so broken it was crazy I was just like wait a

2768
03:18:19,200 --> 03:18:27,420
minute I can't kill him it's like his heels are so my damage
is not enough to kill Arampus

2769
03:18:34,050 --> 03:18:51,790
and then Invis and Loki Invis, Loki and Jeff is so strong
yeah oh no I think I think duel is over I think I think oh

2770
03:18:51,790 --> 03:19:07,990
no guys as a clobbering club clobbering club might be might
be over oh no flats one good for him good for Moxie you

2771
03:19:07,990 --> 03:19:17,980
needed that one final last team was is very strong on paper

2772
03:19:22,900 --> 03:19:35,800
and also he didn't have to go through qualifiers as well so
he didn't have to play against uh vickers sorry too soon

2773
03:19:36,880 --> 03:19:41,520
dude he could have potentially had a chance to get knocked
out

2774
03:19:47,280 --> 03:20:00,360
New suit Bro, I heard he I heard he apparently showed up my
Twitter algorithm That he did a stream recently Um But he

2775
03:20:00,360 --> 03:20:06,860
was only playing melee characters And people were like,
that's weird He was like, why are you playing melee, huh?

2776
03:20:06,960 --> 03:20:08,240
Are you trying to hide something?

2777
03:20:12,810 --> 03:20:13,250
Wait,

2778
03:20:16,610 --> 03:20:18,250
I thought it was, uh,

2779
03:20:23,200 --> 03:20:29,000
I thought it was, I thought it was, I don't, I'm scared, I'm
scared that they didn't have to go through the qualifiers,

2780
03:20:29,120 --> 03:20:29,420
too.

2781
03:20:30,280 --> 03:20:32,940
I don't know, I feel like, I feel like cloak right now.

2782
03:20:33,180 --> 03:20:34,280
I'm feeling cloaky.

2783
03:20:35,180 --> 03:20:36,660
We are hope and fear.

2784
03:20:39,770 --> 03:20:41,750
Who am I gonna banish from this match?

2785
03:20:41,830 --> 03:20:43,230
Jams in your lap, it's fine.

2786
03:20:45,330 --> 03:20:53,670

2789
03:21:17,470 --> 03:21:20,190
We will rise

2790
03:21:26,740 --> 03:21:28,540
Wait, let's see

2791
03:21:38,510 --> 03:21:41,530
Pick your hero Or villain, I'm not judging

2792
03:21:48,750 --> 03:22:02,190
Alright, here we go Oh shit What happened to our Loki I tap
out For one second And I lost the Loki Loki?

2793
03:22:03,710 --> 03:22:04,270
I...

2794
03:22:04,270 --> 03:22:05,670
Oh, wait, they found Loki.

2795
03:22:05,810 --> 03:22:06,450
That's what happened.

2796
03:22:06,570 --> 03:22:07,090
Never mind.

2797
03:22:09,190 --> 03:22:10,110
And then you went.

2798
03:22:10,330 --> 03:22:11,170
Okay, all right.

2799
03:22:12,530 --> 03:22:14,430
Okay, I understand now.

2800
03:22:15,250 --> 03:22:16,430
That's what happened.

2801
03:22:17,170 --> 03:22:17,930
I get it.

2802
03:22:20,190 --> 03:22:21,670
No Loki for me.

2803
03:22:22,670 --> 03:22:23,470
Mantis cloak.

2804
03:22:23,790 --> 03:22:24,170
All right.

2805
03:22:25,030 --> 03:22:26,590
Not a lot of sustainability.

2806
03:22:27,070 --> 03:22:27,610
Oh my gosh.

2807
03:22:27,690 --> 03:22:27,930
Why?

2808
03:22:28,290 --> 03:22:29,590
Why do I...

2809
03:22:29,590 --> 03:22:30,810
Is today like...

2810
03:22:30,810 --> 03:22:32,930
Let's terrorize Doki Day.

2811
03:22:41,880 --> 03:22:45,340
It didn't help that my brain was already fried off the bat.

2812
03:22:45,520 --> 03:22:46,640
It really didn't help.

2813
03:22:48,400 --> 03:22:52,000
I was not locked in at the start.

2814
03:22:55,740 --> 03:22:56,880
No, actually, it didn't help.

2815
03:22:57,040 --> 03:22:59,400
I have to start my day off with triple support.

2816
03:22:59,460 --> 03:23:00,640
Gambit never folds.

2817
03:23:04,540 --> 03:23:05,140
That's...

2818
03:23:05,160 --> 03:23:06,440
That was the line.

2819
03:23:07,040 --> 03:23:08,560
That's where it didn't help.

2820
03:23:09,240 --> 03:23:11,280
I had to go through triple support.

2821
03:23:11,460 --> 03:23:12,820
Cabin never foes.

2822
03:23:13,700 --> 03:23:14,220
Damn.

2823
03:23:17,840 --> 03:23:18,700
Is everybody done?

2824
03:23:18,760 --> 03:23:20,520
He's gonna be fine.

2825
03:23:22,020 --> 03:23:23,520
I hope so.

2826
03:23:26,700 --> 03:23:28,840
Oh, I love dying in front of my healers, man.

2827
03:23:33,030 --> 03:23:35,250
You know, I don't know about you.

2828
03:23:35,410 --> 03:23:36,890
I've never stopped.

2829
03:23:36,910 --> 03:23:48,470
I don't know if he realized we're running a mantis cloak
like you're not getting healed don't you're not getting that

2830
03:23:48,470 --> 03:23:58,470

03:23:58,470 --> 03:24:02,870

2832
03:24:13,050 --> 03:24:33,220
Oh my god, what the- Oh my god Does he not realize what cop
we're- This guy is fucking stupid as hell Damn He better be

2833
03:24:33,220 --> 03:24:37,620
watching replay Because I have not fucking stopped

2834
03:24:42,430 --> 03:24:45,230
Does he not realize what heal cop we're playing?

2835
03:24:51,530 --> 03:24:53,270
Oh my god.

2836
03:25:00,710 --> 03:25:02,010
Oh man, I'm fucking dead here.

2837
03:25:04,770 --> 03:25:06,490
I'm actually dead here.

2838
03:25:09,090 --> 03:25:10,010
Oh my god.

2839
03:25:11,810 --> 03:25:14,410
Does he love dying in front of his healers still?

2840
03:25:18,920 --> 03:25:20,620
I'm back to shed some light.

2841
03:25:21,500 --> 03:25:23,880
He has zero kills!

2842
03:25:25,260 --> 03:25:30,060
He has zero kills!

2843
03:25:30,920 --> 03:25:40,280
Yep, guys, but we all know it's always the support's fault
that he is not getting enabled right now.

2844
03:25:40,380 --> 03:25:41,420
Remember that, guys.

2845
03:25:41,860 --> 03:25:48,620
He is not getting enabled to do his job because it's a
support issue.

2846
03:25:51,600 --> 03:26:10,340
just remember that just remember it's never a him problem he
got what he did it guys he fucking did it oh man oh is it a

2847
03:26:10,340 --> 03:26:18,500
support problem let me use my tire you till on you oh

2848
03:26:25,630 --> 03:26:40,490
man just remember it's always a support problem naughty
anything else there we go they're gonna TP oh

2849
03:26:44,930 --> 03:26:48,210
oh never mind

2850
03:26:56,050 --> 03:26:58,250
He got a fucking Punisher.

2851
03:27:01,710 --> 03:27:03,790
He is, come on, he is a valuable.

2852
03:27:04,090 --> 03:27:05,330
Oh, now, now look at that.

2853
03:27:05,950 --> 03:27:06,830
Yep, there he goes.

2854
03:27:07,030 --> 03:27:09,730
Oh, now he's justified now.

2855
03:27:10,350 --> 03:27:10,890
Look at that.

2856
03:27:11,190 --> 03:27:15,290
Now he's Justified because he has the most kills.

2857
03:27:18,530 --> 03:27:20,170
Are you a man or a woman?

2858
03:27:20,590 --> 03:27:21,610
I'm assuming you're a man.

2859
03:27:22,170 --> 03:27:23,210
Like, how tall are you?

2860
03:27:24,750 --> 03:27:27,230
What is wrong with this guy?

2861
03:27:27,750 --> 03:27:28,910
Bro, I think he's high.

2862
03:27:29,650 --> 03:27:31,430
He's high or he's a little...

2863
03:27:32,310 --> 03:27:33,430
A little...

2864
03:27:38,230 --> 03:27:38,770
185?

2865
03:27:40,850 --> 03:27:42,950
I don't know how to feel about that, man.

2866
03:27:44,310 --> 03:27:45,410
It's not crazy, honestly.

2867
03:27:46,390 --> 03:27:47,070
I know.

2868
03:27:48,310 --> 03:27:49,610
Don't say it.

2869
03:27:49,630 --> 03:27:50,690
I didn't say anything.

2870
03:27:51,290 --> 03:27:52,630
It's a finish your sentence.

2871
03:27:52,970 --> 03:27:53,750
I'm just curious.

2872
03:27:53,750 --> 03:27:54,710
I'm letting you guys finish it.

2873
03:27:54,730 --> 03:27:55,130
Finish it!

2874
03:27:55,290 --> 03:27:56,550
A little silly.

03:27:57,030 --> 03:27:57,950
Yeah, a little silly.

2876
03:27:59,050 --> 03:28:01,390
This is a group effort.

2877
03:28:01,830 --> 03:28:02,670
Finish my sentence.

2878
03:28:03,970 --> 03:28:04,370
Look at that.

2879
03:28:04,630 --> 03:28:09,510
This is a...

2880
03:28:12,700 --> 03:28:15,360
This is a collaborative effort.

2881
03:28:17,300 --> 03:28:17,740
Look at that.

2882
03:28:21,260 --> 03:28:21,880

What the fuck are you doing?

2900
03:30:22,380 --> 03:30:23,760
They both sound the same.

2901
03:30:23,920 --> 03:30:25,860
Did you guys notice that?

2902
03:30:26,600 --> 03:30:30,320
They both have the same fucking voice.

2903
03:30:31,700 --> 03:30:39,520
I literally was like, wait, wait, who, wait, that sounds
just like...

2904
03:30:42,120 --> 03:30:43,160

Let's game right now.

2906
03:30:46,240 --> 03:30:48,300

2907
03:30:51,540 --> 03:30:51,700
Who?

2908
03:30:52,800 --> 03:30:53,700

03:34:19,010 --> 03:34:20,750
I gotta resize the thumbnail.

2951
03:34:20,830 --> 03:34:22,170
It's bigger than two megabytes.

2952
03:34:22,990 --> 03:34:23,390

2957
03:34:33,910 --> 03:34:34,270

03:34:34,290 --> 03:34:34,870
Yo, yo.

03:34:37,170 --> 03:34:38,590

03:34:40,690 --> 03:34:42,150
Alright, resize time.

2961
03:34:43,710 --> 03:34:44,570
It's all happening live.

2962
03:34:44,670 --> 03:34:45,470
That's when you know.

2963
03:34:46,110 --> 03:34:47,070
That's when you know.

2964
03:34:49,530 --> 03:34:50,630
It's all live.

2965
03:34:55,080 --> 03:34:55,640
Alright.

2966
03:34:57,360 --> 03:34:58,040

2967
03:34:59,240 --> 03:35:00,400
Oh, shit.

2968
03:35:02,260 --> 03:35:04,500
Oh, my God.

2969
03:35:04,540 --> 03:35:05,280
Wait, I'm not ready.

2970
03:35:05,460 --> 03:35:06,600
I'm still exporting.

2971
03:35:06,620 --> 03:35:07,100
stuff.

2972
03:35:07,580 --> 03:35:08,260
Give me a sec.

2973
03:35:09,060 --> 03:35:09,740
Quick export.

2974
03:35:11,820 --> 03:35:12,340
JPEG.

2975
03:35:12,640 --> 03:35:13,680
What do you think you want to be today?

2976
03:35:15,700 --> 03:35:16,080
Alright.

2977
03:35:27,720 --> 03:35:30,000
Who am I going to banish from this match?

2978
03:35:50,460 --> 03:35:50,980
Alright.

2979
03:35:52,720 --> 03:35:55,060
This looks like a trip support angle.

2980
03:35:55,500 --> 03:35:59,740
Sorry, I had to work behind, work DMs that I had to go
through.

2981
03:36:01,740 --> 03:36:04,340
I had to type in some work DMs.

2982
03:36:09,390 --> 03:36:11,690
My typing is not that fast.

2983
03:36:13,410 --> 03:36:16,590
That's because when I was little, I did those computer
classes.

2984
03:36:16,990 --> 03:36:18,570
And also, I wrote a lot of role...

2985
03:36:18,570 --> 03:36:21,150
I also did a lot of roleplay in Neopet forums.

2986
03:36:24,090 --> 03:36:26,690
I did the Neopets roleplay.

2987
03:36:27,210 --> 03:36:33,570
I am Loki, goddess of mischief, and the queen of Asgard.

2988
03:36:34,250 --> 03:36:35,910
I typed that shit.

2989
03:36:38,510 --> 03:36:42,170
I have to type fast, you know, because you're always waiting
for your...

2990
03:36:42,170 --> 03:36:42,990
Can you, Jeff?

2991
03:36:44,030 --> 03:36:45,230
You want me to, Jeff?

2992
03:36:47,450 --> 03:36:47,970
No.

2993
03:36:49,530 --> 03:36:50,950
Me, no, Jeff.

2994
03:36:55,520 --> 03:36:57,860
Me, not Jeff, player.

2995
03:37:01,930 --> 03:37:02,650
Round one.

2996
03:37:02,730 --> 03:37:08,230
I am wily, unreliable, vindictive, and yet, oddly
compelling.

2997
03:37:09,010 --> 03:37:09,750
Don't you think?

2998
03:37:10,190 --> 03:37:10,970
All right, here we go.

2999
03:37:11,550 --> 03:37:13,030
30 seconds before you attack.

3000
03:37:14,310 --> 03:37:15,910
I just don't know how to up.

3001
03:37:16,490 --> 03:37:17,430
That's my only problem.

3002
03:37:18,270 --> 03:37:19,850
I don't know how to Jeff up.

3003
03:37:21,870 --> 03:37:24,770
I get very confused and scared.

3004
03:37:28,090 --> 03:37:29,570
I get confused and scared.

3005
03:37:30,070 --> 03:37:32,350
I can play Jeff, but not when I have to up.

3006
03:37:35,430 --> 03:37:36,470
No, you said Loki.

3007
03:37:37,290 --> 03:37:38,390
I know it sounds very...

3008
03:37:38,390 --> 03:37:43,250
I mean, we have a fucking storm right off the bat, so...

3009
03:37:50,940 --> 03:37:53,960

I didn't help.

3030
03:39:42,730 --> 03:39:43,850
I didn't help Bucky just solo with it.

3031
03:39:44,370 --> 03:39:45,090
Oh, man.

3032
03:39:45,310 --> 03:39:46,550

3036
03:39:52,550 --> 03:39:53,970
Can you try to force it, Angela?

3037
03:39:55,630 --> 03:39:57,050
I'm very scared.

3038
03:39:57,390 --> 03:39:59,390
I think the Hawk guy saved his ult.

3039
03:40:00,230 --> 03:40:00,670
That's it.

3040
03:40:02,930 --> 03:40:04,170

Oh my god.

3045
03:40:09,790 --> 03:40:11,690
I saw the Hawk guy look at me.

3046
03:40:12,150 --> 03:40:13,690
I got so scared.

3047
03:40:14,090 --> 03:40:15,250
You have no idea.

I panicked, placed my clone there.

3059
03:41:21,870 --> 03:41:23,330
I panicked, placed my clone.

3060
03:41:24,090 --> 03:41:25,830
I thought I placed it further.

3061
03:41:26,430 --> 03:41:28,110
I was like, oh, that's awkward.

3062
03:41:29,090 --> 03:41:31,450
That clone should have been a bit closer.

3063
03:41:33,390 --> 03:41:36,390
Should have been a bit further away.

3064
03:41:40,880 --> 03:41:42,580
Jesus Christ, I don't want to.

3065
03:41:44,100 --> 03:41:46,660
I have to use my clone to get...

3066
03:41:47,340 --> 03:41:48,060

3070
03:42:25,580 --> 03:42:26,380
That's unlucky.

3071
03:42:26,980 --> 03:42:28,520
Didn't die here?

3072
03:42:29,060 --> 03:42:29,880
All right, we're even, we're even.

We already got it.

3083
03:42:50,560 --> 03:42:52,480
Yeah, but we could have another time.

3084
03:42:52,480 --> 03:42:53,220
Alright, good old Emma.

Did you see that?

3088
03:43:02,460 --> 03:43:03,740
Invis, she didn't care.

3089
03:43:07,140 --> 03:43:07,380
Hello?

3090
03:43:08,400 --> 03:43:08,780
Oh!

3091
03:43:11,260 --> 03:43:13,280
I'll just stay here, I guess.

3092
03:43:15,340 --> 03:43:15,860
Alright.

3093
03:43:16,360 --> 03:43:17,700
I'll just stay here.

3094
03:43:26,320 --> 03:43:27,320
I'm outing after that.

3095
03:43:29,080 --> 03:43:30,240
Alright, 3, 2, 1.

3096
03:43:30,380 --> 03:43:31,120
You can use it this way.

3097
03:43:36,340 --> 03:43:37,420
Aw, that's unlucky.

3098
03:43:37,940 --> 03:43:38,420
I'm on shot.

3099
03:43:39,300 --> 03:43:40,100
I'm on the Hawkeye.

3100
03:43:41,480 --> 03:43:42,080
It's one shot.

3101
03:43:43,840 --> 03:43:44,560
Alright, we got one.

3102
03:43:44,680 --> 03:43:44,940
We got one.

3103
03:43:45,000 --> 03:43:45,260
That's good.

3104
03:43:45,320 --> 03:43:45,860
That's good enough.

3105
03:43:47,740 --> 03:43:48,760
Hawkeye is like glitching.

3106
03:43:48,900 --> 03:43:49,540
It's behind this wall.

3107
03:43:49,740 --> 03:43:50,040
Behind this wall.

3108
03:43:51,040 --> 03:43:51,460
Goodbye.

3109
03:43:52,800 --> 03:43:53,220
Goodbye.

3110
03:43:54,480 --> 03:43:56,660
I mean, he doesn't know I'm here.

3111
03:44:02,900 --> 03:44:14,440
Oh my, I'm just surprised.

3112
03:44:14,760 --> 03:44:15,200
You know what?

3113
03:44:15,460 --> 03:44:17,960
I'm surprised I was even able to like grab the copy in
front.

3114
03:44:18,200 --> 03:44:20,260
You guys see how many people were in front of me there?

3115
03:44:20,320 --> 03:44:22,500
I still managed to grab that copy.

3116
03:44:23,060 --> 03:44:24,680
I'm just, I'm proud of that.

3117
03:44:25,060 --> 03:44:26,180
I'm actually proud of that.

3118
03:44:26,400 --> 03:44:30,440
I, there was no, I was so surprised I was even able to grab
that copy in the end.

3119
03:44:32,300 --> 03:44:32,880
Hawkeye's upright.

3120
03:44:33,060 --> 03:44:33,420
Hawkeye's upright.

3121
03:44:33,520 --> 03:44:35,020
Yep, yep, yep.

3122
03:44:35,580 --> 03:44:35,960
All right.

3123
03:44:36,760 --> 03:44:37,820
We're going to be fine.

3124
03:44:38,320 --> 03:44:40,780
Not, oh, you're so lucky.

3125
03:44:41,640 --> 03:44:42,160
I'm on Punisher.

3126
03:44:42,420 --> 03:44:44,740
Because there was no way I should have been able to grab
that.

3127
03:44:44,740 --> 03:44:45,880
Come on Emma.

3128
03:44:51,250 --> 03:44:53,490
It's a four star one jet in the back.

3129
03:44:54,390 --> 03:44:54,770
I'm on not.

3130
03:44:56,350 --> 03:44:57,030
Kill him before.

3131
03:44:58,070 --> 03:44:58,350
Everybody.

3132
03:44:59,650 --> 03:45:00,830
Fucking cares about this.

3133
03:45:00,930 --> 03:45:01,130
Yeah.

3134
03:45:01,930 --> 03:45:02,810
I'm ulting after this.

3135
03:45:02,950 --> 03:45:03,650
I'm ulting after this.

3136
03:45:04,030 --> 03:45:04,410
Give me up.

3137
03:45:04,490 --> 03:45:05,490
Give the Punisher up.

3138
03:45:08,090 --> 03:45:08,470
Woo!

3139
03:45:10,170 --> 03:45:12,010
We got it.

3140
03:45:12,930 --> 03:45:13,770
We got it.

3141
03:45:14,330 --> 03:45:14,750

3149
03:46:23,970 --> 03:46:25,750
I was not expecting that.

3150
03:46:27,730 --> 03:46:30,090
I was like, oh my God, I did grab her.

3151
03:46:30,470 --> 03:46:31,710
I had to do a double take.

3152
03:46:32,690 --> 03:46:36,050
I actually had to do a double take to be like, did I get
her?

3153
03:46:37,990 --> 03:46:39,550
I actually hesitated.

3154
03:46:40,290 --> 03:46:42,670
Even I was like, what the fuck?

3155
03:46:43,390 --> 03:46:45,130
I actually managed to get her?

3156
03:46:46,330 --> 03:46:48,990
And that hesitation actually killed my team.

3157
03:46:50,070 --> 03:46:53,490
Just because I hesitated, it actually almost killed my team.

3158
03:46:54,950 --> 03:46:56,530
I was so shocked.

3159
03:46:59,070 --> 03:47:00,210
Careful, careful, careful, come.

3160
03:47:00,870 --> 03:47:04,550
All right, I'm not much losing the left eye right now, right
now, right now.

3161
03:47:04,730 --> 03:47:05,010
I'm not losing.

3162
03:47:05,890 --> 03:47:06,790
They cannot push.

3163
03:47:06,950 --> 03:47:07,330
They cannot push.

3164
03:47:12,190 --> 03:47:12,770
Come on, Mac.

3165
03:47:16,670 --> 03:47:17,450
Come on, thing.

3166
03:47:20,210 --> 03:47:20,530

One and share stuff.

3168
03:47:21,010 --> 03:47:21,510
One and share stuff.

3169
03:47:21,570 --> 03:47:24,030
Moon and one, shut up top.

3170
03:47:27,010 --> 03:47:27,750
Give me up.

3171
03:47:28,430 --> 03:47:28,570
Force.

3172
03:47:28,710 --> 03:47:29,110
I'm up top.

3173
03:47:29,250 --> 03:47:30,350
They have two and high gun.

3174
03:47:31,310 --> 03:47:32,230
Two and high gun.

3175
03:47:32,730 --> 03:47:39,500
Moon and I want you up top.

3176
03:47:39,760 --> 03:47:39,860
All right.

3177
03:47:39,940 --> 03:47:40,260
Please.

3178
03:47:40,700 --> 03:47:41,300
Don't let the Swap off.

3179
03:47:41,900 --> 03:47:42,840
I have the Swap off.

3180
03:47:47,220 --> 03:47:48,740
I have the Swap off.

3181
03:47:48,740 --> 03:47:49,820
I have to swap off Loki.

3182
03:47:50,060 --> 03:47:50,900
It's not worth playing.

3183
03:47:51,780 --> 03:47:52,520
It's not worth it.

3184
03:47:56,020 --> 03:48:02,480
I have to play at the play like, like, like with my team
because it's like, it's like so dangerous.

3185
03:48:02,500 --> 03:48:03,640
If you can get the hook, nice.

3186
03:48:04,060 --> 03:48:04,520
Everybody punishers?

3187
03:48:04,780 --> 03:48:06,300
That's right.

3188
03:48:07,040 --> 03:48:07,520
Yeah.

3189
03:48:08,460 --> 03:48:09,260
I'm healing.

3190
03:48:11,060 --> 03:48:12,040
Look at me go.

3191
03:48:13,400 --> 03:48:16,300
Oh, he swapped.

3192
03:48:16,300 --> 03:48:17,160
No, he's still Moon Knight.

3193
03:48:17,780 --> 03:48:18,400
All right.

3194
03:48:18,740 --> 03:48:19,740
Let's see here.

3195
03:48:22,080 --> 03:48:22,440
4FF.

3196
03:48:28,180 --> 03:48:28,840
We have six.

3197
03:48:28,840 --> 03:48:30,320
Oh my god, we have six oz.

3198
03:48:31,260 --> 03:48:34,780
Guys, that's all, that's, guys, wouldn't it be funny if we
all use six oz there?

3199
03:48:34,880 --> 03:48:35,880
Why don't you hear something, all right?

3200
03:48:36,260 --> 03:48:37,600
Why would that be so sweet?

3201
03:48:39,100 --> 03:48:40,100
Oh, there you go.

3202
03:48:40,640 --> 03:48:41,980
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on you.

3203
03:48:43,020 --> 03:48:43,480
Oh, shit.

3204
03:48:45,560 --> 03:48:46,760
Sin die, sin die, sin die.

3205
03:48:46,800 --> 03:48:48,460
Wait, what the fuck was that up?

3206
03:48:48,760 --> 03:48:50,800
Oh, we're not, we're even at the six.

3207
03:48:51,520 --> 03:48:52,240
Come on.

3208

Come back.

3212
03:49:03,920 --> 03:49:04,900
Oh my god, get in here.

3213
03:49:05,040 --> 03:49:05,160
Get in.

3214
03:49:05,220 --> 03:49:05,820
Why are you not Maryland?

3215
03:49:06,060 --> 03:49:10,560
Oh my god Oh, this is bad

3216
03:49:14,180 --> 03:49:15,960

I'm sorry Look at one shot.

3218
03:49:26,480 --> 03:49:27,150
Look at one shot.

3219
03:49:29,020 --> 03:49:29,680
I need heals.

3220
03:49:29,840 --> 03:49:30,310
I need heals.

3221
03:49:33,040 --> 03:49:34,520
I'm dead.

3222
03:49:35,380 --> 03:49:36,120
I'm dead.

3223
03:49:37,220 --> 03:49:39,880
Oh my god.

3224
03:49:40,340 --> 03:49:40,860
Oh my god.

3225

That worked.

3226
03:49:42,400 --> 03:49:43,160
Oh my god.

3227
03:49:43,580 --> 03:49:44,380
That worked.

3228
03:49:44,940 --> 03:49:46,320
Oh my god.

3229
03:49:46,680 --> 03:49:49,860
I'm so fucking good at this game.

3230
03:49:50,940 --> 03:49:51,020
Oh.

3231
03:49:54,640 --> 03:49:55,900
We're down to support.

3232
03:49:56,660 --> 03:49:58,820
Punisher behind, Punisher behind with the chatty.

3233

He's below, below, below, below.

3235
03:50:04,540 --> 03:50:05,480
Below, behind you, behind him.

3236
03:50:06,860 --> 03:50:08,240
Okay, that's just karma.

3237
03:50:09,060 --> 03:50:10,620
Why did I say anything?

3238
03:50:11,220 --> 03:50:19,860
I- We have low kill.

3239
03:50:20,280 --> 03:50:22,720

Oh my goodness.

3246
03:50:40,560 --> 03:50:41,400
That's right.

3247
03:50:41,440 --> 03:50:43,420
What you gotta do about that?

3248
03:50:43,940 --> 03:50:45,540
I have double throat.

3249
03:50:49,960 --> 03:50:53,640
I still am insane at this game.

3250
03:50:55,420 --> 03:50:56,380
Oh, shit.

3251
03:50:56,960 --> 03:50:57,900
I'll be down to Google now.

3252
03:50:58,040 --> 03:50:58,340
You get her.

3253
03:50:58,460 --> 03:50:58,720
You get her.

3254
03:50:59,100 --> 03:50:59,140
Nice.

3255
03:50:59,180 --> 03:50:59,440
Okay.

3256
03:51:01,600 --> 03:51:03,680
That's a concept moral.

3257
03:51:04,180 --> 03:51:04,680
I'm sorry.

3258
03:51:08,320 --> 03:51:12,480
I don't understand why he still threw the rock at me after
he saw my land.

3259
03:51:13,640 --> 03:51:17,400
I still, I don't understand why he's still committed to it.

3260
03:51:17,720 --> 03:51:19,960
I was literally the only person with the lap.

3261
03:51:20,040 --> 03:51:21,980
I didn't even give lap to anyone else.

3262
03:51:24,160 --> 03:51:25,300
I killed me.

3263
03:51:25,520 --> 03:51:26,100
A cute game.

3264
03:51:26,240 --> 03:51:27,460
Weird ass aider.

3265
03:51:28,700 --> 03:51:28,720

3266
03:51:32,440 --> 03:51:34,380
Oh my god.

3267
03:51:35,560 --> 03:51:37,300
In the end.

3268
03:51:37,660 --> 03:51:38,360
In the end.

3269
03:51:38,700 --> 03:51:40,160
I still won the game.

3270
03:51:41,560 --> 03:51:49,640
In the end.

3271
03:51:50,160 --> 03:51:50,980
In the end.

3272
03:51:51,020 --> 03:51:53,080
I still won the game.

3273
03:51:53,340 --> 03:51:53,620
Yeah.

3274
03:51:57,100 --> 03:51:58,740

Let me grab the Twitter.

3291
03:54:50,070 --> 03:54:54,210
I gotta link it properly because I was not paying attention.

3292
03:54:54,930 --> 03:54:55,730
There we go.

3293
03:54:56,490 --> 03:54:56,850
Nice.

03:54:57,330 --> 03:54:58,110
Alright, there we go.

3295
03:54:58,710 --> 03:55:00,750
Who am I gonna banish from this match?

3296
03:55:02,630 --> 03:55:03,350
Alright.

3297
03:55:03,830 --> 03:55:05,610
Now I wanna play Rocket.

3298
03:55:06,150 --> 03:55:11,090
I literally pulled out, like, the fucking game of the
century on Loki there.

3299
03:55:22,410 --> 03:55:22,410
Alright.

3300
03:55:23,050 --> 03:55:23,670
Here we go.

3301
03:55:28,180 --> 03:55:28,760
It's time.

3302
03:55:28,900 --> 03:55:36,640
I deserve I deserve a I think I personally think I deserve a
rocket break.

3303
03:55:38,940 --> 03:55:39,260
Oh my god.

3304
03:55:39,360 --> 03:55:39,940
It's already clipped.

3305
03:55:40,100 --> 03:55:40,600
Oh my god.

3306
03:55:40,640 --> 03:55:41,840
Guys, I'm retweeting that.

3307
03:55:44,800 --> 03:55:46,400
It's already clipped.

3308
03:55:56,710 --> 03:55:59,350
Pick your hero or villain.

3309
03:55:59,610 --> 03:56:00,390
I'm not judging.

3310
03:56:01,550 --> 03:56:03,390
Who are you calling a raccoon, huh?

3311
03:56:11,680 --> 03:56:12,940
My god.

3312
03:56:15,380 --> 03:56:16,720
Here we go.

3313
03:56:20,100 --> 03:56:20,860
It...

3314
03:56:20,860 --> 03:56:22,040
Allura or Prism?

3315
03:56:23,340 --> 03:56:24,100
Wait, Prism?

3316
03:56:24,280 --> 03:56:26,160
The guy that just won first place?

3317
03:56:28,220 --> 03:56:28,980
Okay.

3318
03:56:30,580 --> 03:56:31,220
That...

3319
03:56:31,220 --> 03:56:33,000
Is it a couch-sharing bend?

3320
03:56:34,760 --> 03:56:36,700
This better... Oh, man.

3321
03:56:36,980 --> 03:56:41,880
That would be so awkward if this was the Prism in the J3
tournament.

3322
03:56:46,740 --> 03:56:48,020
Because apparently...

3323
03:56:48,020 --> 03:56:52,660
Apparently, for that tournament, you're not supposed to do
that.

3324
03:56:55,340 --> 03:56:58,980
This better not be the Prism from the J3 tournament.

3325
03:56:59,000 --> 03:57:02,660
because that's gonna be so awkward.

3326
03:57:04,500 --> 03:57:07,600
It's not just one first place.

3327
03:57:11,680 --> 03:57:12,560
What happened?

3328
03:57:13,100 --> 03:57:18,520
Oh, in the chat, someone was like, oh yeah, which account,
like, who's on this shared account right now?

3329
03:57:18,640 --> 03:57:20,840
And then it was like, Allora, Siri, or Prism?

3330
03:57:21,340 --> 03:57:23,460
And one of them was like, it's Prism right now.

3331
03:57:23,560 --> 03:57:28,480
And then I'm like, wait a minute, Blast had a teammate name
called Prism too.

3332
03:57:30,500 --> 03:57:31,540
Oh no!

3333
03:57:34,460 --> 03:57:35,460
Oh no!

3334
03:57:37,440 --> 03:57:38,880
It's okay, they already won.

3335
03:57:39,160 --> 03:57:41,320
They can't get kicked out if they already won the game.

3336
03:57:41,660 --> 03:57:44,000
They already won, but they won the tournament.

3337
03:57:45,300 --> 03:57:46,440
They already won.

3338
03:57:46,580 --> 03:57:47,120
What are they gonna do?

3339
03:57:47,240 --> 03:57:48,120
Take his money?

3340
03:57:50,060 --> 03:57:50,580
True.

3341
03:57:51,080 --> 03:57:52,520
He's like, you know what?

3342
03:57:52,620 --> 03:57:53,100
I won.

3343
03:57:53,200 --> 03:57:54,980
It's time to share accounts now.

3344
03:57:55,520 --> 03:57:55,940
It's...

3345
03:57:59,000 --> 03:58:01,400
It's time to share account now.

3346
03:58:02,400 --> 03:58:02,780
Obviously, it's a joke.

3347
03:58:02,900 --> 03:58:05,620
We don't know for sure if this is the...

3348
03:58:05,620 --> 03:58:07,540
A lot of people could be named Prism.

3349
03:58:07,820 --> 03:58:08,540
We don't know.

3350
03:58:15,480 --> 03:58:18,040
Was Prism their tank player guy?

3351
03:58:19,200 --> 03:58:20,480
No, it was TTK.

3352
03:58:20,660 --> 03:58:23,540
Their Prism was, like, the DPS player or some shit.

3353
03:58:26,700 --> 03:58:31,040
Oh, I should be like, Are you the Prism from the flat state
of it?

3354
03:58:31,340 --> 03:58:32,640
And then expose.

3355
03:58:34,800 --> 03:58:36,640
New video up!

3356
03:58:38,000 --> 03:58:39,440
Got a new video up!

3357
03:58:40,900 --> 03:58:43,800
Another video for the J3 tournament.

3358
03:58:47,750 --> 03:58:49,050
Put it here just in case.

3359
03:58:49,250 --> 03:58:50,490
Alright, that's fine.

3360
03:58:53,990 --> 03:58:55,050
Hold on, my...

3361
03:58:57,890 --> 03:58:59,750
Oh, that's awkward.

3362
03:59:01,350 --> 03:59:05,070
Oh, is prison the support?

3363
03:59:06,310 --> 03:59:09,170
Yeah, so I was like, I don't know which one it was.

3364
03:59:09,830 --> 03:59:10,770
I wasn't familiar.

3365
03:59:11,730 --> 03:59:13,430
But also it could be anyone.

3366
03:59:14,310 --> 03:59:16,930
There's John Prism and there's Dave Prism.

3367
03:59:17,970 --> 03:59:20,050
I don't even know which account it was.

3368
03:59:25,580 --> 03:59:29,800
No, it's just don't be stupid if you're publicly sharing
accounts.

3369
03:59:30,240 --> 03:59:32,240
Because it's apparently...

3370
03:59:32,240 --> 03:59:33,680
That was a...

3371
03:59:33,680 --> 03:59:36,120
It's like, well, not apparently it is.

3372
03:59:37,800 --> 03:59:49,120
is against TOS, and if you get caught, you actually, like,
as a like, if you are, like, a pro, or, like, trying to be

3373
03:59:49,120 --> 03:59:53,420
pro, you are not supposed to share accounts, because it's
against TOS.

3374
03:59:56,380 --> 03:59:57,640
Oh, my God, forgot they have...

3375
03:59:57,640 --> 03:59:59,160
I'm sorry, I forgot they have Phoenix.

3376
03:59:59,340 --> 04:00:00,100
That is my bad.

3377
04:00:00,580 --> 04:00:02,080
I legitimately forgot.

3378
04:00:02,280 --> 04:00:03,000
I will swap.

3379
04:00:05,340 --> 04:00:16,840
I I legitimately forgot that they had wait are they oh wait
this is not i legitimately forgot i was not paying attention

3380
04:00:19,440 --> 04:00:28,820

should have pulled him back when he was flying

3381
04:00:31,960 --> 04:00:36,100
oh he's fine right

3382
04:00:43,250 --> 04:00:45,610
Oh, I'm okay.

3383
04:00:48,980 --> 04:00:49,880
I almost got it.

3384
04:00:50,040 --> 04:00:50,700
What the fuck?

3385
04:00:51,820 --> 04:00:56,000
Yeah, he's got it.

3386
04:01:00,210 --> 04:01:02,560
I'm gonna wait.

3387
04:01:06,220 --> 04:01:07,200
I'm gonna wait.

3388
04:01:07,940 --> 04:01:08,060
No,

3389
04:01:13,060 --> 04:01:14,460
why you push him towards me?

3390
04:01:15,080 --> 04:01:16,420
Oh, you idiot!

3391
04:01:18,560 --> 04:01:20,280
Fuck you, donkey bird.

3392
04:01:20,780 --> 04:01:22,600
I'm their fucking duo fucking healer with you.

3393
04:01:22,740 --> 04:01:23,200
Fuck you, bird.

3394
04:01:26,880 --> 04:01:27,700
I know.

3395
04:01:28,100 --> 04:01:30,120
Why are they all...

3396
04:01:30,120 --> 04:01:31,020
It was me...

3397
04:01:31,680 --> 04:01:33,800
It was three of us.

3398
04:01:34,080 --> 04:01:34,920
I pushed them.

3399
04:01:35,480 --> 04:01:36,660
I pushed them.

3400
04:01:36,660 --> 04:01:37,360
Who's two of this idiot?

3401
04:01:38,000 --> 04:01:39,440
I pushed them two.

3402
04:01:40,300 --> 04:01:40,940
No, wait.

3403
04:01:41,660 --> 04:01:46,080
There were three of us that could have got hit.

3404
04:01:46,180 --> 04:01:48,100
I didn't know you were there.

3405
04:01:49,340 --> 04:01:50,980
Agent money, please, swap.

3406
04:01:51,660 --> 04:01:52,020
Please.

3407
04:01:52,740 --> 04:01:53,900
Just keep playing.

3408
04:01:54,240 --> 04:01:54,420
Heal?

3409
04:01:54,820 --> 04:01:55,040
Agent money?

3410
04:01:55,940 --> 04:01:56,900
You're all...

3411
04:01:56,900 --> 04:01:59,720
If he all did without me pushing.

3412
04:02:01,020 --> 04:02:01,240
Why?

3413
04:02:01,240 --> 04:02:02,780
How are you so unaware?

3414
04:02:02,900 --> 04:02:03,980
I went to save my Emma.

3415
04:02:04,300 --> 04:02:06,720
Why were you at front line?

3416
04:02:07,400 --> 04:02:10,300
Why was he on the front line?

3417
04:02:10,520 --> 04:02:12,920
He was in front of them.

3418
04:02:13,500 --> 04:02:15,840
He was in front of them.

3419
04:02:16,200 --> 04:02:17,300
That's fucking funny.

3420
04:02:18,560 --> 04:02:19,400
Nothing much you can do.

3421
04:02:20,000 --> 04:02:22,680
I have no idea what you're talking about.

3422
04:02:23,140 --> 04:02:25,200
Bro, they're so angry.

3423
04:02:27,540 --> 04:02:28,360
Oh, it's them!

3424
04:02:28,620 --> 04:02:29,240
It's this guy!

3425
04:02:29,400 --> 04:02:30,080
Fuck that guy.

3426
04:02:30,500 --> 04:02:31,100
That's bad.

3427
04:02:31,580 --> 04:02:33,040
Yo, five and one, you're not doing anything.

3428
04:02:33,180 --> 04:02:34,160
I think you can play heal.

3429
04:02:34,360 --> 04:02:35,180
That's probably why you're walking.

3430
04:02:35,940 --> 04:02:37,540
No, I would have put that one right on.

3431
04:02:37,960 --> 04:02:38,400
No, yeah.

3432
04:02:38,580 --> 04:02:39,240
Try it on everything.

3433
04:02:39,620 --> 04:02:41,060
I probably don't want to lose it.

3434
04:02:41,060 --> 04:02:42,100
Guys, you got it on Phoenix.

3435
04:02:42,340 --> 04:02:43,840
Yeah, I'm horrible.

3436
04:02:45,220 --> 04:02:46,020
Holy shit.

3437
04:02:47,000 --> 04:02:48,420
Everyone's so mad.

3438
04:02:49,240 --> 04:02:52,000
This guy last time, last game he was playing infinite.

3439
04:02:52,080 --> 04:02:53,280
Phoenix is not the problem.

3440
04:02:54,700 --> 04:02:57,200
Oh, look, Phoenix is 1v9 and you're speaking to this guy.

3441
04:02:57,440 --> 04:02:57,880
Just so you know.

3442
04:02:58,040 --> 04:02:59,080
No, I'm killing everyone, bro.

3443
04:02:59,120 --> 04:02:59,720
I'm killing everyone.

3444
04:03:00,080 --> 04:03:00,860
I mean, this is good.

3445
04:03:00,980 --> 04:03:01,400
You're talking.

04:03:01,440 --> 04:03:02,300
Yo, can I get some hope?

3447
04:03:02,340 --> 04:03:03,100

3449
04:03:04,360 --> 04:03:06,060

3450
04:03:07,140 --> 04:03:07,900

Yo, can't point, can't point, can't point.

3452
04:03:12,240 --> 04:03:13,500

3453
04:03:15,100 --> 04:03:15,500
Oh.

3454
04:03:15,820 --> 04:03:16,000
Oh.

3455
04:03:17,700 --> 04:03:18,420
Who is this?

3456
04:03:18,420 --> 04:03:19,820
What's going on?

3457
04:03:20,360 --> 04:03:21,700
That's crazy.

3458
04:03:23,760 --> 04:03:24,700
Oh my god.

3459
04:03:25,680 --> 04:03:26,360
That's crazy.

3460
04:03:26,760 --> 04:03:29,780
That's your fucking father right there.

3461
04:03:32,180 --> 04:03:32,540
Oh my god.

3462
04:03:32,540 --> 04:03:34,040
I'm seeing you do fuck all the name works.

3463
04:03:34,820 --> 04:03:36,380
Oh my god.

3464
04:03:39,520 --> 04:03:40,780
That's crazy.

3465
04:03:44,740 --> 04:03:46,580
I mean, we're fine here.

3466
04:03:47,200 --> 04:03:48,180
We just have one.

3467
04:03:48,420 --> 04:03:51,480
Boreal, now.

3468
04:03:55,960 --> 04:03:58,220
Yeah, guys, we're winning, you know, guys.

3469
04:03:58,800 --> 04:04:01,200
All this stuff was people.

3470
04:04:08,000 --> 04:04:10,320
How is this working?

3471
04:04:10,880 --> 04:04:12,320
That's crazy.

3472
04:04:14,260 --> 04:04:15,980
That can't work.

3473
04:04:19,240 --> 04:04:21,520
That's insane, bro.

3474
04:04:22,080 --> 04:04:30,620
I wonder, bro, you hear how the Punisher guy is now super
quiet after like his team fucking roasted him back?

3475
04:04:31,480 --> 04:04:37,580
I think that's fucking hilarious.

3476
04:04:38,720 --> 04:04:40,720
I got several supports.

3477
04:04:41,060 --> 04:04:42,620
Yeah, you got five deaths per block.

3478
04:04:43,820 --> 04:04:44,520
Oh, let's go support.

3479
04:04:44,860 --> 04:04:45,580
Ace monkey.

3480
04:04:46,540 --> 04:04:47,360
Like you see my final.

3481
04:04:52,360 --> 04:04:54,580
Oh my god.

3482
04:04:55,540 --> 04:04:57,720
And then he swapped the widow.

3483
04:04:59,500 --> 04:05:00,820
I didn't have anything here.

3484
04:05:01,420 --> 04:05:01,660
It's okay.

3485
04:05:01,760 --> 04:05:03,940
They used literally three ults to kill me.

3486
04:05:04,140 --> 04:05:05,000
That's crazy.

3487
04:05:05,700 --> 04:05:07,020
And then he went.

3488
04:05:07,540 --> 04:05:08,960
The widow maker.

3489
04:05:09,180 --> 04:05:09,820
Let's see.

3490
04:05:10,080 --> 04:05:14,000
The moment it was like, in any way, winnable.

3491
04:05:14,220 --> 04:05:16,080
He was like, oh, I'm not throwing hard enough.

3492
04:05:16,520 --> 04:05:16,840
That's all right.

3493
04:05:16,860 --> 04:05:17,840
We can just report him.

3494
04:05:18,420 --> 04:05:18,960
clip too.

3495
04:05:19,020 --> 04:05:21,180
We all know he's a fucking idiot.

3496
04:05:23,160 --> 04:05:25,980
Now all of China know what you did.

3497
04:05:28,380 --> 04:05:30,820
everyone knows what kind of player you are.

3498
04:05:31,220 --> 04:05:34,260
Wait, that fucking guy is in Pislow!

3499
04:05:35,440 --> 04:05:37,240
He's in my Pislow!

3500
04:05:37,680 --> 04:05:40,160
This guy is like Tarn stuck here.

3501
04:05:40,200 --> 04:05:41,320
He's trying to be pro.

3502
04:05:41,900 --> 04:05:43,640
And he fucking, that's crazy.

3503
04:05:43,780 --> 04:05:46,260
I just realized that guy.

3504
04:05:46,500 --> 04:05:48,060
He's in my elo.

3505
04:05:48,420 --> 04:05:58,980
Right now, I'm fucking doom keeling No, not this guy there's
the the enemy team.

3506
04:05:59,020 --> 04:06:04,160
That's why I think it's fucking hilarious Look at that these
they're so desperate.

3507
04:06:04,300 --> 04:06:07,100
That must be queued with Doki, buddy

3508
04:06:13,020 --> 04:06:21,120
Oh my god, you must oh my god, he must be so embarrassed
right now He doesn't know he's thinking on stream.

3509
04:06:24,080 --> 04:06:26,280
That's actually crazy.

3510
04:06:27,500 --> 04:06:29,340
All right, let's- all right, guys.

3511
04:06:29,640 --> 04:06:31,780
What do you want to say about this loser, this widow loser?

3512
04:06:31,920 --> 04:06:34,400
Say everything you want to say to him.

3513
04:06:35,380 --> 04:06:36,240
Say yeah.

3514
04:06:43,490 --> 04:06:44,130

Bro, this- worse than Zaza.

3517
04:07:00,880 --> 04:07:02,970

Two guys that decided to throw.

That's me holding back.

3566
04:12:12,670 --> 04:12:14,990
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

3567
04:12:17,230 --> 04:12:17,790
I'm actually...

3568
04:12:17,790 --> 04:12:20,270
The thing is, I'm actually holding back.

3569
04:12:20,410 --> 04:12:22,890
I could be a lot more toxic.

3570
04:12:24,430 --> 04:12:37,090
There's like a lot of things I could sick the fact that he
linked like a reputable school esport program on his social

3571
04:12:37,090 --> 04:12:44,950
media everywhere and he that's how he represents himself
like it's like how you know when you're at a job interview

3572
04:12:44,950 --> 04:12:51,610
like they comb your social media and everything like your
you know your internet history is still there like like

04:12:51,610 --> 04:13:04,610
whatever you say and everything if that's how you represent
yourself publicly get hired exactly it's easy just search up

04:13:34,660 --> 04:13:35,560
Don't harass anyone.

3579
04:13:36,640 --> 04:13:37,720
I stop myself.

3580
04:13:37,920 --> 04:13:40,900
Like, I let my toxicity take me there.

3581
04:13:41,940 --> 04:13:43,600
But do not search him up.

3582
04:13:46,160 --> 04:13:47,860
Okay, don't harass anyone.

3583
04:13:48,740 --> 04:13:53,500
If he wants to harass people, like, your digital footprint
is everywhere, buddy.

3584
04:13:55,320 --> 04:13:56,240
Alright, I'm gonna swap.

3587
04:14:09,980 --> 04:14:22,080
okay no need to bring yourself down his love sorry i got
like way into the toxic mindset i got way into it but i will

3590
04:14:42,530 --> 04:14:43,050
Is our match?

3591
04:14:43,050 --> 04:14:43,750
It's going to be okay.

3592
04:14:44,010 --> 04:14:44,230
He is.

3593
04:14:45,010 --> 04:14:46,270
He's not going to be okay.

3594
04:14:50,770 --> 04:14:51,510
Alright, it's fine.

3595
04:14:51,650 --> 04:14:52,050
We're fine.

3596
04:14:55,840 --> 04:14:57,740
Man, this is not okay.

3597
04:15:07,420 --> 04:15:08,020
Alright.

3598
04:15:08,760 --> 04:15:11,160
I just feel bad for Fisher Esport.

3599
04:15:13,200 --> 04:15:17,820
Having having someone who who's like that.

3600
04:15:27,230 --> 04:15:29,330
Oh, watch this.

3601
04:15:31,030 --> 04:15:32,390
My turn.

3602
04:15:37,020 --> 04:15:38,460
Oh, what the fuck?

3603
04:15:38,700 --> 04:15:39,720
How did our guy die?

3604
04:15:41,560 --> 04:15:41,740
What?

3605
04:15:42,700 --> 04:15:44,540
Our team died.

3606
04:15:46,780 --> 04:15:48,340
Wait, why would you go Loki?

3607
04:15:48,700 --> 04:15:49,520
They have Moon Knight.

3608
04:15:50,220 --> 04:15:52,760
That was the reason why I went off.

3609
04:15:52,900 --> 04:15:54,340
I swapped off of Loki.

3610
04:15:55,900 --> 04:15:57,820
They have Moon Knight.

3611
04:16:00,040 --> 04:16:01,800
I was like, wait a minute.

3612
04:16:02,540 --> 04:16:04,120
Why are you on Loki?

3613
04:16:17,030 --> 04:16:18,750
Oh, I couldn't do anything about it.

3614
04:16:18,890 --> 04:16:19,730
I got caught.

3615
04:16:24,420 --> 04:16:24,680
Oh, my.

3616
04:16:24,700 --> 04:16:25,420
I got caught.

3617
04:16:25,540 --> 04:16:26,100
That's unlucky.

3618
04:16:26,200 --> 04:16:27,600
Our Loki almost had it up, too.

3619
04:16:28,780 --> 04:16:29,840
Okay, I'm still...

3620
04:16:29,840 --> 04:16:31,200
Okay, I thought I was in the first spot.

3621
04:16:37,960 --> 04:16:39,140
All right, here we go.

3622
04:16:39,720 --> 04:16:41,680
Yo, Bedford, are you a real person?

3623
04:16:43,220 --> 04:16:44,680
I love Weekend.

3624
04:16:44,940 --> 04:16:48,920
I fucking love weekend queues, guys.

3625
04:16:52,380 --> 04:16:53,740
I have

3626
04:17:00,000 --> 04:17:05,960
to be here.

3627
04:17:07,000 --> 04:17:09,120
I mean, we're running Hawk and Rogue.

3628
04:17:09,440 --> 04:17:10,200
Like, I don't know.

3629
04:17:10,400 --> 04:17:11,200
And we have...

3630
04:17:14,560 --> 04:17:15,240
Hello.

3631
04:17:15,960 --> 04:17:16,260
Wait, what?

3632
04:17:20,110 --> 04:17:21,390
Wait, what?

3633
04:17:23,150 --> 04:17:23,770
Oh my god.

3634
04:17:23,910 --> 04:17:25,330
I thought I landed on the up.

3635
04:17:25,650 --> 04:17:26,870
Where was the up?

3636
04:17:28,450 --> 04:17:29,890
Where was the up?

3637
04:17:30,310 --> 04:17:31,010
Was I not?

3638
04:17:31,170 --> 04:17:32,770
I didn't even get healed from it.

3639
04:17:34,230 --> 04:17:37,970
I thought if I landed there, I would be fine, but I guess I
wasn't.

3640
04:17:40,510 --> 04:17:41,330
I wasn't.

3641
04:17:41,390 --> 04:17:43,270
Oh my god, the blue is so hard to see.

3642
04:17:43,770 --> 04:17:44,630
I swear to God.

3643
04:17:45,710 --> 04:17:47,750
That blue is so fucking hard to see.

3644
04:17:48,590 --> 04:17:52,150
I hate the cloak up sometimes, only because it's like...

3645
04:17:53,590 --> 04:18:09,270
I oh my god why are we still on Loki oh my god okay I made
it just in time all

3646
04:18:13,230 --> 04:18:25,950
right there we go I I personally hate cloak up because
they're they feel so hard to the sea in general i feel like

3647
04:18:25,950 --> 04:18:37,490
cloca could be more easier to look at i'm just gonna die on
point there's no reason but can i actually don't even think

3648
04:18:37,490 --> 04:18:46,310
i think we're gonna get rushed at i'm gonna get hella

3649
04:18:46,310 --> 04:18:50,450

3650
04:18:50,470 --> 04:18:50,970
That scared me.

3651
04:18:50,970 --> 04:18:51,510
That scared me.

3652
04:18:51,650 --> 04:18:54,230
Oh my god, he finally realized he got swapped to...

3653
04:18:54,230 --> 04:18:54,410
Oh.

3654
04:18:54,890 --> 04:19:01,300
He finally realized.

3655
04:19:13,500 --> 04:19:14,000
Oh.

3656
04:19:16,200 --> 04:19:16,400
Oh.

3657
04:19:20,540 --> 04:19:26,820
I think this might be a weekend queue lobby, guys.

3658
04:19:27,420 --> 04:19:29,820
This might be a weekend queue lobby, everybody.

3659
04:19:32,620 --> 04:19:37,200
This might be a weekend Q lobby right here.

3660
04:19:39,200 --> 04:19:39,920
Wait one minute?

3661
04:19:40,140 --> 04:19:40,700
I'm surprised.

3662
04:19:40,920 --> 04:19:41,780
I could I would last.

3663
04:19:43,400 --> 04:19:45,600
Legitimately thought it would have been four minutes.

3664
04:19:46,300 --> 04:19:48,920
All right.

3665
04:20:03,880 --> 04:20:06,240
Is everybody okay?

3666
04:20:08,400 --> 04:20:11,060
The console is zero.

3667
04:20:12,060 --> 04:20:13,940
We have Deadpool and Hulk

3668
04:20:18,440 --> 04:20:20,860
I guess not

3669
04:20:24,780 --> 04:20:32,340
Guys I think I got my answer I think I got my answer And you
should hang yourself

3670

Thank you J3.

3673
04:20:56,820 --> 04:20:59,420
We got

3674
04:21:04,240 --> 04:21:05,420
a shield, Tandy.

3675
04:21:08,740 --> 04:21:11,820
The pain before the content.

3676
04:21:19,820 --> 04:21:21,360
I don't pay attention to that.

3677
04:21:21,500 --> 04:21:22,360
I'm just fucking dead.

3678
04:21:22,380 --> 04:21:36,380
I just play Yeah, that show match Set the tone for the
entire day It really did It really did Would be what I

3679
04:21:36,380 --> 04:21:41,960
thought I mean, we had some pretty Sick games, I guess

3680
04:21:51,240 --> 04:22:05,700

eyes who are you who do you not know what day it is

3682
04:22:23,450 --> 04:22:36,410
who's that one guy that still is like guys come on it's it's
possible you guys just aren't trying Yes, I don't think

3683
04:22:36,410 --> 04:22:37,510
that's it.

3684
04:22:38,130 --> 04:22:41,270
I don't think any amount of trying will help.

3685
04:22:42,550 --> 04:22:44,450
I literally think this is trying.

3686
04:22:44,670 --> 04:22:46,110
That's the saddest part.

3687
04:22:46,550 --> 04:22:48,330
This is them trying.

3688
04:22:53,090 --> 04:22:53,930
There you go.

3689
04:22:56,770 --> 04:22:57,410
Sorry.

3690
04:22:58,670 --> 04:22:59,710
That's actually on me.

3691
04:22:59,770 --> 04:23:01,090
I was not paying attention.

3692
04:23:03,510 --> 04:23:09,950
I mean, I mean, he should understand why I'm not pocketing.

3693
04:23:10,210 --> 04:23:11,330
He should understand.

3694
04:23:15,830 --> 04:23:16,350
Oh, true.

3695
04:23:16,490 --> 04:23:18,130
It's like the league situation, right?

3696
04:23:18,150 --> 04:23:19,550
Where people hold people hostage.

3697
04:23:20,390 --> 04:23:21,030
Is that it?

3698
04:23:22,450 --> 04:23:23,910
Is that what it is?

3699
04:23:24,430 --> 04:23:26,090
Is really the league situation?

3700
04:23:26,950 --> 04:23:28,630
Where you get held hostage?

3701
04:23:36,370 --> 04:23:39,250
All right, how about that jump pad over there?

3702
04:23:39,450 --> 04:23:40,990
Yo, I'm going to do something.

3703
04:23:42,310 --> 04:23:42,730
Goodbye.

3704
04:23:43,910 --> 04:23:44,230
It's okay.

3705
04:23:44,350 --> 04:23:45,430
I got a kill, though.

3706
04:23:46,290 --> 04:23:46,470
Wait.

3707
04:23:50,430 --> 04:23:50,990
Hey, though.

3708
04:23:52,010 --> 04:23:53,890
Oh, it didn't matter.

3709
04:23:56,290 --> 04:23:58,490
Hey, I got a support out, Alex.

3710
04:23:58,990 --> 04:24:00,010
I got a Groot.

3711
04:24:00,190 --> 04:24:03,230
I got a Groot support out and Moon Knight.

3712
04:24:03,470 --> 04:24:05,650
Oh, I think that's the equivalent exchange.

3713
04:24:05,710 --> 04:24:08,490
I won all the first three.

3714
04:24:08,810 --> 04:24:13,270
What a fucking deal W I know right one up for three

3715
04:24:27,970 --> 04:24:36,130
Oh Hey, you can't I saw my fault, you know your play moon
that you know how these goes you know how these arms go

3716
04:24:36,130 --> 04:24:37,630
Look, it's okay.

3717
04:24:38,010 --> 04:24:38,610
It's okay.

3718
04:24:38,790 --> 04:24:38,790
It's okay.

3719
04:24:38,910 --> 04:24:39,730
But you miss

3720
04:24:45,220 --> 04:24:56,580

least I get a health back.

Thank you.

3724
04:25:02,320 --> 04:25:05,840
I do love the weekend.

3725
04:25:08,260 --> 04:25:11,300
Guys, this might be the time where this might be the...

3726
04:25:11,960 --> 04:25:16,220
This might be the time where this might be the last weekend
queue we've ever got.

3727
04:25:17,020 --> 04:25:19,660
What we ever get in general.

3728
04:25:24,820 --> 04:25:31,520
it truly might be I don't know how much longer I can survive
weekend queues

3729
04:25:39,980 --> 04:25:48,820
I've actually never had because I usually never play on
weekends but it's actually crazy the amount of people that

3730
04:25:48,820 --> 04:26:03,880
complain every game it's actually crazy I think like this is
the record This and yesterday is like the record for how

3731
04:26:03,880 --> 04:26:08,120
many people have complained almost every day.

3732
04:26:08,740 --> 04:26:10,000
It's actually insane.

3733
04:26:11,660 --> 04:26:16,300
I do this for you guys so you know to avoid weekend.

3734
04:26:16,360 --> 04:26:16,840
I don't care.

3735
04:26:16,920 --> 04:26:18,700
You're like, this is the only time I get to play.

3736
04:26:19,000 --> 04:26:20,080
It's not worth it.

3737
04:26:20,340 --> 04:26:25,220
If this is the only day you get to play Rivals, it's not
worth it.

3738
04:26:25,280 --> 04:26:26,960
For your sanity's sake.

3739
04:26:30,620 --> 04:26:43,740

04:27:11,660 --> 04:27:12,140
Never play.

3745
04:30:23,390 --> 04:30:23,390

04:34:08,190 --> 04:34:10,590
And it worked!

3782
04:34:12,010 --> 04:34:14,150
And it just...

3783
04:34:14,150 --> 04:34:17,390
It just works, it just works, it just works.

3784
04:34:18,050 --> 04:34:20,050
It just fucking works.

3785
04:34:22,370 --> 04:34:23,670
Not TPing.

3786
04:34:30,920 --> 04:34:33,290
I mean, like...

3787
04:34:33,290 --> 04:34:35,340
Yeah, they're not TPing, like...

3788
04:34:36,950 --> 04:34:38,630
He's just...

3789
04:34:38,630 --> 04:34:41,770
He gets validated for that gameplay.

3790
04:34:43,110 --> 04:34:45,860
things up, including which side you're on.

3791
04:34:48,450 --> 04:34:50,750
You'll need a match team to win this one.

3792
04:34:50,950 --> 04:34:53,510
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

3793
04:34:53,690 --> 04:34:55,050
Bro actually was, yeah.

3794
04:34:55,470 --> 04:34:57,410
Bro actually was invincible.

3795
04:34:57,910 --> 04:34:58,410
It's crazy.

3796
04:34:59,170 --> 04:35:00,590
Oh my god, funny story.

3797
04:35:00,870 --> 04:35:02,850
I forgot about the story to tell you guys.

3798
04:35:06,270 --> 04:35:14,950
um, after yesterday's stream, I got a spam email from the
old Twitch creative director it but like it was like them

3799
04:35:14,950 --> 04:35:21,710
trying to pretend that he would like it was like they're
like your your twitch account has suspicious activity of

3800
04:35:21,710 --> 04:35:32,230
botting and um and inaccurate numbers and i was like what
i'm so confused i was like and viewer activity i was like

3801
04:35:32,230 --> 04:35:44,690
what but then they sent it to my business email which by the
way it's not the email i use for my twitch and then so So,

3802
04:35:45,090 --> 04:35:48,770
and then, and then it was like from, um, what was this name?

3803
04:35:48,950 --> 04:35:50,490
Wait, what was this guy's name?

3804
04:35:50,730 --> 04:35:51,710
He put it on?

3805
04:35:52,130 --> 04:35:53,710
Let me check it real quick.

3806
04:35:56,010 --> 04:36:02,970
It's so, by Marcus Graham, who was, who retired in 2022.

3807
04:36:05,690 --> 04:36:13,090
He was the old Twitch creative director who retired in 2022,
like, 20.

3808
04:36:13,110 --> 04:36:17,490
2022, not suspicious at all.

3809
04:36:18,950 --> 04:36:23,410
Like, make sure you use, make sure you use this website to
check out your not body.

3810
04:36:23,890 --> 04:36:26,930
Like, I didn't even know what he wanted to do.

3811
04:36:27,390 --> 04:36:33,090
Like, the crazy thing is, I couldn't even tell what the
scammer wanted from me.

3812
04:36:33,610 --> 04:36:37,830
Like, he's suspicious.

3813
04:36:38,370 --> 04:36:42,150
Like, I couldn't tell what the scammer wanted from me.

3814
04:36:44,350 --> 04:36:47,110
It was not very like...

3815
04:36:51,220 --> 04:36:52,820
There was no fish...

3816
04:36:54,340 --> 04:36:56,440
There was no fishing lake.

3817
04:36:56,520 --> 04:36:58,680
I think he wanted me to reply back.

3818
04:36:59,420 --> 04:37:00,300
I didn't click anything.

3819
04:37:00,460 --> 04:37:04,220
I think what he wanted was he wanted me to reply back.

3820
04:37:04,900 --> 04:37:06,420
And then like...

3821
04:37:07,500 --> 04:37:09,620
And then like then send me a link.

3822
04:37:09,720 --> 04:37:12,060
Because there was no link at all.

3823
04:37:17,090 --> 04:37:19,570
I was like so fucking confused.

3824
04:37:20,230 --> 04:37:21,030
All right, here.

3825
04:37:25,450 --> 04:37:27,130
I mean, I'm still alive.

3826
04:37:27,650 --> 04:37:29,270
Well, um, I don't know now.

3827
04:37:30,110 --> 04:37:31,230
Where's my Loki?

3828
04:37:32,050 --> 04:37:33,190
My Loki died.

3829
04:37:34,050 --> 04:37:35,390
Oh, it's a Deadpool.

3830
04:37:37,130 --> 04:37:40,070
I was like, all right, I'm ready for the copy.

3831
04:37:41,370 --> 04:37:42,750
I'm so ready.

3832
04:37:43,710 --> 04:37:47,070
I didn't even realize I didn't even have a fucking Loki.

3833
04:37:47,090 --> 04:37:59,970
anymore okay now it's definitely loosable now now that I
know what our cop is now is it is loosable I'm looking for

3834
04:37:59,970 --> 04:38:15,840
it oh shit I should have went in there I didn't think that
Phoenix was right there

3835
04:38:19,600 --> 04:38:23,060
thought you wouldn't see me again all right Coming back.

3836
04:38:25,480 --> 04:38:25,880
Are they running?

3837
04:38:26,200 --> 04:38:26,380
No.

3838
04:38:30,410 --> 04:38:32,810
Yeah, I'm like, now this is loosable.

3839
04:38:33,290 --> 04:38:34,910
Because we're running dead pool.

3840
04:38:35,790 --> 04:38:36,590
That's support.

3841
04:38:37,690 --> 04:38:38,550
Oh, that's unlucky.

3842
04:38:40,050 --> 04:38:40,570
Yes.

3843
04:38:41,190 --> 04:38:42,830
He fucking knows now.

3844
04:38:43,090 --> 04:38:44,010
He's like, wait a minute.

3845
04:38:44,090 --> 04:38:45,770
This isn't an easy victory.

3846
04:38:47,550 --> 04:38:49,710
Bro, this guy almost caps, bro.

3847
04:38:50,230 --> 04:38:51,270
What do you mean?

3848
04:38:52,750 --> 04:38:54,150
He's like, wait a minute.

3849
04:38:54,170 --> 04:38:56,170
I don't get an easy GG's

3850
04:39:05,820 --> 04:39:09,540
Okay, I can't see anything there Let's hope that

3851
04:39:16,040 --> 04:39:17,860
I have to use that

3852
04:39:23,940 --> 04:39:26,220
All right, hey, there's a phoenix right here.

3853
04:39:26,680 --> 04:39:28,340
I hope we kill it.

3854
04:39:28,340 --> 04:39:41,480
Oh my god almost Oh my All right, look I I will blame my
loot I will blame my Loki for that.

3855
04:39:42,840 --> 04:39:45,200
This might be a Loki.

3856
04:39:45,360 --> 04:39:47,660
I will blame my Loki deadpool.

3857
04:39:48,340 --> 04:39:49,900
I count it.

3858
04:39:53,200 --> 04:39:58,740
Because it was definitely unwearable before he went
deadpool.

3859
04:40:02,900 --> 04:40:05,260
Oh, he should not have used that.

3860
04:40:09,080 --> 04:40:09,840
Oh.

3861
04:40:09,920 --> 04:40:27,280
We copy way to him All right, there we go there we go never
punished and never never punished Never never punished

3862
04:40:27,280 --> 04:40:30,500
apparently and he'll never learn his lesson.

3863
04:40:30,660 --> 04:40:35,840
I need you guys to know that because of this He'll never
learn his lesson.

3864
04:40:36,320 --> 04:40:44,920
He'll be like see it works He's like guys see It worked,
guys.

3865
04:40:46,680 --> 04:40:47,360
Upgrade.

3866
04:40:47,580 --> 04:40:48,580
Thank you for the 100 videos.

3867
04:40:48,920 --> 04:40:49,020
Thank you.

3868
04:40:49,400 --> 04:40:49,780
Thank you.

3869
04:40:52,680 --> 04:40:56,440
And he'll never learn that Deadpool was maybe not the play.

3870
04:41:08,770 --> 04:41:09,170
Alright.

3871
04:41:09,290 --> 04:41:14,990
Did you guys see the clip of the Nick A guy?

3872
04:41:15,970 --> 04:41:20,890
Is now trying to, as the family-friendly streamer, try to
play Arkery.

3873
04:41:20,910 --> 04:41:24,850
So, and it was not going so well.

3874
04:41:25,270 --> 04:41:27,390
The one that was like never back down, never what?

3875
04:41:27,810 --> 04:41:28,330
That guy.

3876
04:41:29,550 --> 04:41:32,910
He's the guy who said never back down, never what?

3877
04:41:33,470 --> 04:41:40,030
He's the guy that, and his whole branding is that he'll
never swear.

3878
04:41:42,150 --> 04:41:49,830
He'll never swear and, and like say, like, he's just whole,
very family-friendly.

3879
04:41:49,830 --> 04:41:57,790
um and he'll like and he when he said he said i think like a
couple of months ago he accidentally said shit in fortnite

3880
04:41:57,790 --> 04:42:06,750
and he was like oh my god sorry sorry sorry like and i was
like bro what it's shit is so fucking tame that like i was

3881
04:42:06,750 --> 04:42:17,250

like actually actually finally swore for the first time

3882
04:42:17,250 --> 04:42:23,270
recently and then he was like to go on to the Ark Raiders
bandwagon.

3883
04:42:25,050 --> 04:42:34,010
He tried to go into the Ark Raiders bandwagon and the moment
he got on, the moment he got on, he got slurred at.

3884
04:42:40,070 --> 04:42:41,810
Oh my God.

3885
04:42:42,810 --> 04:42:45,970
He actually, yeah, he got yeah.

3886
04:42:47,550 --> 04:42:49,130
I was like, bro.

3887
04:42:50,490 --> 04:42:54,730
Yeah, no, he got, to be fair, I saw the clip.

3888
04:42:55,210 --> 04:43:04,750
And to be fair, the first thing he said, like, he said to
this guy, because he got knocked it down, he got down, um,

3889
04:43:05,970 --> 04:43:12,110
he got down by the, uh, by this guy, like, he lost the 1v1.

3890
04:43:12,590 --> 04:43:21,250
And then I will say it was very cringe, but he was like, um,
he was like, okay, I don't want to say it, but he basically,

3891
04:43:21,310 --> 04:43:32,690
I'll say it in the most dead tone, but he said it in the
most cringy ass tone ever yeah he said oh whoa are you going

3892
04:43:32,690 --> 04:43:44,070
to res me but he said it in that the cutesy uh the cutesy
cringe way and then the guy instantly slurred at him

3893
04:43:53,130 --> 04:44:02,310
it never justified I had to slur at someone, but I was just
like, bro, what did you expect, bro?

3894
04:44:06,530 --> 04:44:10,990
Dude, I win game.

3895
04:44:18,990 --> 04:44:24,070
Bro, he got slurred and then instantly gunned down.

3896
04:44:24,390 --> 04:44:25,830
Oh my god, we have a Black Panther.

3897
04:44:28,730 --> 04:44:34,430
He got fucking pop, pop, pop, and then like, and then
fucking...

3898
04:44:37,710 --> 04:44:40,130
It fucking got slurred in.

3899
04:44:44,740 --> 04:44:45,720
It was crazy.

3900
04:44:46,300 --> 04:44:49,900
I was like, bro, does God think he's going to clip farm me?

3901
04:44:49,980 --> 04:44:51,240
Bro, he did clip farm.

3902

Bro, that shit got clip far and hard.

04:44:58,640 --> 04:45:00,260
He did clip farm.

3905
04:45:09,000 --> 04:45:10,880
Need to say, it was a growth.

Oh, shit.

Here you go.

3957
04:49:39,900 --> 04:49:40,560
I have to.

3958
04:49:40,660 --> 04:49:41,400
It's just counter.

3959
04:49:41,600 --> 04:49:43,080
He's just gonna counter mine.

3960
04:49:44,580 --> 04:49:47,120
I'm not even gonna try and go in.

3961
04:49:49,300 --> 04:49:50,320
Holy shit.

3962
04:49:51,840 --> 04:49:53,380
I mean, you got him.

3963
04:49:53,760 --> 04:49:54,720
Oh, and it doesn't matter.

3964
04:49:55,440 --> 04:49:57,900
The amount of damage is crazy.

3965
04:50:02,040 --> 04:50:04,680
Is it actually one game?

3966
04:50:05,040 --> 04:50:07,240
We've had one, guys.

3967
04:50:07,740 --> 04:50:08,600
That's great.

3968
04:50:09,860 --> 04:50:12,600
It's been one game.

3969
04:50:13,160 --> 04:50:17,340
It'll be one game where people did not yell at each other.

3970
04:50:17,980 --> 04:50:22,220
Oh, that record is not ideal.

3971
04:50:22,420 --> 04:50:23,940
I will admit.

3972
04:50:25,820 --> 04:50:28,900
I will admit that one.

3973
04:50:30,220 --> 04:50:31,540
I hope we...

3974
04:50:31,540 --> 04:50:31,940
Oh my God.

3975
04:50:32,040 --> 04:50:33,360
actually hit it.

3976
04:50:39,480 --> 04:50:41,220
That's crazy.

3977
04:50:41,920 --> 04:50:44,520
One game is actually our record.

3978
04:50:46,960 --> 04:50:48,520
Reset the clock.

3979
04:50:48,920 --> 04:51:03,200
Yes, out of all the games I've played today, the fact that
one game is the record where where nobody was yelling at

3980
04:51:03,200 --> 04:51:03,940
each other.

3981
04:51:06,300 --> 04:51:10,200
That, I'm sorry, but that's just sad.

3982
04:51:14,960 --> 04:51:18,350
That is...

3983
04:51:18,350 --> 04:51:19,470
Oh, please help me.

3984
04:51:19,530 --> 04:51:20,330
He's out of that.

3985
04:51:21,090 --> 04:51:21,970
That is good.

3986
04:51:27,400 --> 04:51:29,380
That makes me a little sad.

3987
04:51:30,080 --> 04:51:32,160
That is the case.

3988
04:51:33,400 --> 04:51:35,020
That makes me a little sad.

3989
04:51:35,040 --> 04:51:54,320
sad only only a little sad okay maybe very sad you're right
you're right shouldn't excuse it it is actually incredibly

3990
04:51:54,320 --> 04:52:00,860
sad if it's you zero first all right

3991
04:52:13,160 --> 04:52:14,620
guys the car is there

3992
04:52:19,040 --> 04:52:22,240
The card was on the right.

3993
04:52:24,640 --> 04:52:28,040
You'll need a top-notch game to win this one.

3994
04:52:28,580 --> 04:52:29,000
The card...

3995
04:52:34,210 --> 04:52:35,150
I just...

3996
04:52:41,320 --> 04:52:42,760
I'm like...

3997
04:52:42,760 --> 04:52:44,020
The card is on...

3998
04:52:49,980 --> 04:52:51,340
What card?

3999
04:52:51,480 --> 04:52:52,560
They already forgot.

4000
04:52:53,040 --> 04:52:53,900
Where it went.

4001
04:52:55,240 --> 04:52:56,060
That's it.

4002
04:52:56,060 --> 04:52:56,160
That's it.

4003
04:52:56,180 --> 04:52:56,920
That's crazy.

4004
04:52:58,080 --> 04:53:01,180
Weekend lobbies, I swear this is like a circus.

4005
04:53:02,220 --> 04:53:05,420
Saturday and Sunday are truly circus hours.

4006
04:53:19,920 --> 04:53:24,060
The team was so toxic it balanced out.

4007
04:53:25,140 --> 04:53:25,840
Oh, dokeybird.

4008
04:53:26,180 --> 04:53:26,520
Hey.

4009
04:53:27,860 --> 04:53:28,380
Hello.

4010
04:53:29,640 --> 04:53:34,540
Look at that.

4011
04:53:34,660 --> 04:53:36,700
Look a nice person right now.

4012
04:53:37,460 --> 04:53:38,240
I don't.

4013
04:53:38,360 --> 04:53:39,940
You don't remember me.

4014
04:53:48,970 --> 04:53:58,290
He's like, you don't remember me.

4015
04:53:58,990 --> 04:54:00,250
He is sort of right.

4016
04:54:01,310 --> 04:54:03,350
He is absolutely right.

4017
04:54:09,460 --> 04:54:11,080
Oh, he went diamond mode.

4018
04:54:12,120 --> 04:54:13,820
Why did he go diamond mode?

4019
04:54:13,960 --> 04:54:15,620
Are you scared or something?

4020
04:54:17,780 --> 04:54:19,740
Man, it's like he's scared.

4021
04:54:19,960 --> 04:54:20,360
Whoa.

4022
04:54:21,000 --> 04:54:23,040
He's like, oh, it's so fucking fast.

4023
04:54:23,200 --> 04:54:24,760
I'm still at 65.

4024
04:54:25,580 --> 04:54:26,880
Like, what the fuck?

4025
04:54:30,000 --> 04:54:31,320
What are you aiming at?

4026
04:54:33,240 --> 04:54:33,660
Oh,

4027
04:54:42,540 --> 04:54:43,780
it's no longer okay.

4028
04:54:52,110 --> 04:54:53,150
I'll fight for my...

4029
04:54:53,150 --> 04:54:55,050
There's no longer okay, yeah.

4030
04:55:00,210 --> 04:55:02,550
To be fair, it was very hard to build up.

4031
04:55:07,780 --> 04:55:09,080
I do have up now.

4032
04:55:09,240 --> 04:55:10,660
We can use it aggressively here.

4033
04:55:10,760 --> 04:55:11,480
I don't know, actually.

4034
04:55:11,560 --> 04:55:14,520
I feel like Moonlight's gonna have all of them get fucked up
in general.

4035
04:55:14,540 --> 04:55:15,080
Yep

4036
04:55:19,440 --> 04:55:28,680
I fucking knew it I I called it I was like I feel that moon
is just gonna all that I'm gonna get fucked up I knew it I

4037
04:55:28,680 --> 04:55:30,760
called it I'm used up again.

4038
04:55:31,300 --> 04:55:32,200
What's it the team regroups?

4039
04:55:33,600 --> 04:55:37,840
Yeah, I love so bad

4040
04:55:42,010 --> 04:55:50,770
Okay, I'm just gonna I'm scared I don't know if everybody
would be okay here.

4041
04:55:55,850 --> 04:55:57,230
Alright, I gotta use this.

4042
04:55:57,590 --> 04:56:02,750
I could have, I could have fucking brought it closer, but I
was very paranoid.

4043
04:56:10,720 --> 04:56:12,760
I mean, I pulled him back.

4044
04:56:13,020 --> 04:56:14,180
Oh, he dashed back.

4045
04:56:17,480 --> 04:56:18,120
Okay.

4046
04:56:21,120 --> 04:56:23,380
I ain't doing...

4047
04:56:23,380 --> 04:56:24,040
Oh, it's okay.

4048
04:56:24,160 --> 04:56:24,680
I'm my shield.

4049
04:56:26,920 --> 04:56:28,500
I don't have my shield no more.

4050
04:56:36,540 --> 04:56:39,280
I need them to start yelling at each other again.

4051
04:56:39,340 --> 04:56:41,900
Because we started winning when that was going on.

4052
04:56:43,920 --> 04:56:46,600
We started winning when...

4053
04:56:46,600 --> 04:56:48,120
I will say...

4054
04:56:48,120 --> 04:56:51,100
We were winning when they were angry.

4055
04:56:51,120 --> 04:57:09,800
at each other and I do would think maybe I think maybe
that's what we need oh shit nice maybe we don't need anger

4056
04:57:09,800 --> 04:57:24,270
maybe okay nice I think he pulled it.

4057
04:57:28,350 --> 04:57:28,830
I don't know.

4058
04:57:28,970 --> 04:57:29,430
I don't know.

4059
04:57:29,610 --> 04:57:31,610
I don't think peace and love is it anymore.

4060
04:57:34,290 --> 04:57:35,190
I don't know.

4061
04:57:36,230 --> 04:57:37,830
I don't think it's a...

4062
04:57:37,830 --> 04:57:39,790
I don't think peace and love work, y'all.

4063
04:57:39,890 --> 04:57:41,090
The weekends, guys.

4064
04:57:41,630 --> 04:57:43,450
I think it's just war.

4065
04:57:49,450 --> 04:57:51,310
Oh, we have double shields.

4066
04:57:51,310 --> 04:57:52,150
What the fuck is he?

4067
04:57:53,350 --> 04:57:55,310
Aww, oh my god.

4068
04:57:55,470 --> 04:57:56,950
I lagged a little bit there.

4069
04:57:57,990 --> 04:57:59,270
I mean, he used...

4070
04:57:59,270 --> 04:58:00,990
I mean, he just used it.

4071
04:58:01,090 --> 04:58:02,350
Like, there's no reason, really.

4072
04:58:03,370 --> 04:58:03,790
Oh my god.

4073
04:58:06,990 --> 04:58:08,610
Oh no, there was no point.

4074
04:58:09,470 --> 04:58:09,970
He did!

4075
04:58:10,210 --> 04:58:11,510
Oh, he used three odds?

4076
04:58:13,590 --> 04:58:17,710
I think white is a very good motivator for sure.

4077
04:58:17,850 --> 04:58:19,010
I thought you wouldn't see me again.

4078
04:58:21,590 --> 04:58:31,290
i think i think we might need that because that guy he's not
getting yelled at no more so now he's playing for he's

4079
04:58:31,290 --> 04:58:32,830
playing black panther

4080
04:58:36,690 --> 04:58:47,790
but he was getting yelled at when he was getting yelled at
he wanted to play like are we oh my god we actually

4081
04:58:54,460 --> 04:58:57,040
oh i pushed him in to lose.

4082
04:59:03,930 --> 04:59:04,730
That's fine.

4083
04:59:14,180 --> 04:59:17,060
Oh my god, we could have killed him, we could have killed
him, we could have killed him.

4084
04:59:17,560 --> 04:59:18,800
We actually could have killed him.

4085
04:59:20,760 --> 04:59:21,760
I'm so sad.

4086
04:59:25,690 --> 04:59:28,550
Oh my god, we could have killed him!

4087
04:59:33,740 --> 04:59:35,340
That's unfortunate.

4088
04:59:40,430 --> 04:59:42,570
See guys, we could have.

4089
04:59:48,580 --> 04:59:54,160
Like this guy, he's just sending any missiles to anyone that
would listen.

4090
04:59:54,960 --> 04:59:57,640
He's just, everybody's a fucking...

4091
05:00:04,420 --> 05:00:06,380
Everyone's a casualty.

4092
05:00:07,640 --> 05:00:09,500
Oh my god!

4093
05:00:09,800 --> 05:00:13,360
Like, nobody is safe!

4094
05:00:17,280 --> 05:00:19,720
He flims everybody.

4095
05:00:20,040 --> 05:00:23,640
I like how he's 18, 16, and he's like, it's not me.

4096
05:00:24,780 --> 05:00:26,480
It can't be me.

4097
05:00:26,820 --> 05:00:28,280
It can't be me.

4098
05:00:28,860 --> 05:00:32,620
It's not me.

4099
05:00:45,590 --> 05:00:49,030
I don't know, it's what I

4100
05:00:52,510 --> 05:00:54,990
have to be in here because I'm a little

4101
05:00:58,660 --> 05:01:02,680
scared.

4102
05:01:08,980 --> 05:01:11,260
Bro, Dixie's the main character.

4103
05:01:22,950 --> 05:01:24,040
That's crazy.

4104
05:01:28,550 --> 05:01:30,310
He was like...

4105
05:01:31,430 --> 05:01:33,530
They were like...

4106
05:01:33,530 --> 05:01:36,010
Oh my god, I swear to God, these two are a duo.

4107
05:01:37,470 --> 05:01:38,830
I swear to God.

4108
05:01:41,690 --> 05:01:44,910
But like he said, it's not me.

4109
05:01:45,390 --> 05:01:46,710
It's not...

4110
05:01:46,710 --> 05:01:48,330
It's not...

4111
05:01:48,330 --> 05:01:49,790
It's not me.

4112
05:01:50,350 --> 05:01:51,770
It's 2018.

4113
05:01:52,950 --> 05:01:55,950
Why did he blame me and the rocket?

4114
05:01:56,690 --> 05:01:58,290
By the way, the rocket...

4115
05:01:58,310 --> 05:02:14,330
did go rocket when there's a phoenix so he did he did go
linking your discord to is fucking wild yeah

aggressively they just they're like literally i got coaching

4119
05:02:55,570 --> 05:02:59,830
but trust me to be like when we We got alt forward.

4120
05:03:01,510 --> 05:03:03,030
Not use it defensively.

4121
05:03:03,090 --> 05:03:06,130
We got aggressively used the suit of.

4122
05:03:08,730 --> 05:03:09,890
But it's not.

4123
05:03:11,590 --> 05:03:12,410
Yeah, beatbox.

4124
05:03:12,490 --> 05:03:13,330
Here's my discord.

4125
05:03:14,630 --> 05:03:16,490
Yeah, he literally was like, you got all deeper.

4126
05:03:16,650 --> 05:03:17,610
You got all deeper.

4127
05:03:21,560 --> 05:03:23,100
That's fucking hilarious.

4128
05:03:24,800 --> 05:03:27,340
But it's also the one time I did it too.

4129
05:03:28,880 --> 05:03:30,140
It was like the one time.

4130
05:03:30,160 --> 05:03:32,660
I don't even know if he was blaming it, though.

4131
05:03:32,780 --> 05:03:34,960
He's like, all these random support ults.

4132
05:03:35,400 --> 05:03:37,240
I'm like, what do you mean all these?

4133
05:03:37,460 --> 05:03:38,500
You mean the one?

4134
05:03:42,460 --> 05:03:45,100
All these fucking support ults.

4135
05:03:45,420 --> 05:03:47,100
You mean the one support ults?

4136
05:03:47,240 --> 05:03:48,100
I threw out.

4137
05:03:51,200 --> 05:03:53,700
I was like, bro, you gotta get your eyes checked.

4138
05:03:55,500 --> 05:03:58,240
You gotta get those eyes checked, bro.

4139
05:04:07,570 --> 05:04:09,210
Maybe look at your...

4140
05:04:09,210 --> 05:04:11,250
Clearly, there's something wrong with your ass.

4141
05:04:11,390 --> 05:04:12,810
You can't fucking see.

4142
05:04:14,790 --> 05:04:18,690
If you can't even see, like, the fucking...

4143
05:04:19,410 --> 05:04:20,610
16, 18.

4144
05:04:21,190 --> 05:04:23,330
The guy had a negative KDA.

4145
05:04:23,550 --> 05:04:31,210
The guy had a negative KDA and was, like, this ain't really
winnable, guys.

4146
05:04:49,940 --> 05:04:50,420
No.

4147
05:04:50,600 --> 05:04:51,120
Oh, man.

4148
05:04:51,120 --> 05:04:51,600
Not my hell up.

4149
05:04:51,960 --> 05:04:52,660
Why is it best, no?

4150
05:04:52,660 --> 05:04:53,920
No, they banned my hell up.

4151
05:04:56,960 --> 05:05:03,200
okay oh my that's so funny someone was like you're the only

4152
05:05:09,820 --> 05:05:19,400
that's so funny someone got mad that i was like saying that
man it sucks that the other team was trying so hard um

4153
05:05:19,400 --> 05:05:28,520
during the show match they made a tweet about it And then
it's so funny because literally my teammates came to my chat

4154
05:05:28,520 --> 05:05:30,060
and was also complaining.

4155
05:05:30,460 --> 05:05:37,160
Like, I thought it was looking hilarious.

4156
05:05:39,960 --> 05:05:44,040
But my teammates literally came to my chat and was like,
bro, it sucks, man.

4157
05:05:47,440 --> 05:05:48,260
What you playing?

4158
05:05:48,640 --> 05:05:50,360
It sucks that we had to try so hard.

4159
05:05:50,740 --> 05:05:52,080
Hmm, that's a good question there, sir.

4160
05:05:52,180 --> 05:05:52,780
That's a good question.

4161
05:05:53,340 --> 05:05:54,920
Yes, I do say so myself.

4162
05:05:55,900 --> 05:05:56,300
Individably.

4163
05:05:56,540 --> 05:05:57,520
I thought it was funny.

4164
05:05:58,720 --> 05:05:59,780
I like what I'm seeing.

4165
05:06:01,160 --> 05:06:02,020
Who is this, bro?

4166
05:06:02,220 --> 05:06:02,760
If you wish.

4167
05:06:03,460 --> 05:06:04,440
The name's Shangitsilong.

4168
05:06:05,260 --> 05:06:07,340
I don't think they realized that...

4169
05:06:07,340 --> 05:06:11,500
I don't think they realized what the meta is and what
people...

4170
05:06:12,400 --> 05:06:15,900
During the show match, we're abusing.

4171
05:06:16,180 --> 05:06:18,540
Oh, sorry.

4172
05:06:18,760 --> 05:06:19,640
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

4173
05:06:19,780 --> 05:06:21,040
See, I thought you were getting hostile on me.

4174
05:06:21,160 --> 05:06:21,520
I tried to...

4175
05:06:22,100 --> 05:06:23,300
I tried to win my man back.

4176
05:06:23,320 --> 05:06:24,520
Hold on.

4177
05:06:24,680 --> 05:06:25,280
You're good?

4178
05:06:25,460 --> 05:06:25,900
What's your name?

4179
05:06:25,920 --> 05:06:27,560
My name is not Chungus Lover.

4180
05:06:28,040 --> 05:06:28,500
But I...

4181
05:06:28,500 --> 05:06:29,420
Oh, that's a beautiful name.

4182
05:06:29,640 --> 05:06:30,040
That's a beautiful name.

4183
05:06:30,080 --> 05:06:30,720
That's a beautiful name.

4184
05:06:31,120 --> 05:06:32,580
I was like, bro, you...

4185
05:06:32,580 --> 05:06:34,080
They cannot see my teammates.

4186
05:06:34,320 --> 05:06:36,080
We're not happy, too.

4187
05:06:39,040 --> 05:06:42,240
Just wait till you see the stat line after the first few
fights.

4188
05:06:42,920 --> 05:06:43,280
Oh, boy.

4189
05:06:43,360 --> 05:06:43,940
You won't be...

4190
05:06:43,940 --> 05:06:45,160
You won't be loving me anymore.

4191
05:06:45,200 --> 05:06:45,500
I hear.

4192
05:06:45,540 --> 05:06:45,960
They have an Invis.

4193
05:06:47,480 --> 05:06:47,880
Fighting?

4194
05:06:48,140 --> 05:06:48,340
Behind.

4195
05:06:49,200 --> 05:06:50,220
Oh, that's bottom man.

4196
05:06:50,600 --> 05:06:51,060
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4197
05:06:51,080 --> 05:06:51,480
Whoa, whoa.

4198
05:06:51,960 --> 05:06:52,200
Nice.

4199
05:06:54,480 --> 05:06:55,780
Oh, that's fine.

4200
05:06:56,300 --> 05:06:57,320
I had to use...

4201
05:06:57,860 --> 05:06:58,960
I had to use that, though.

4202
05:07:01,540 --> 05:07:03,360
Oh, here we go.

4203
05:07:04,900 --> 05:07:05,500
It's alright.

4204
05:07:05,620 --> 05:07:07,520
Just people want to complain or complain.

4205
05:07:08,100 --> 05:07:13,400
If they really didn't like me, they're just gonna use
anything they can to let me like...

4206
05:07:13,400 --> 05:07:13,660
See!

4207
05:07:13,940 --> 05:07:14,600
There it is!

4208
05:07:14,840 --> 05:07:15,680
There it is!

4209
05:07:15,840 --> 05:07:16,740
There she is!

4210
05:07:17,300 --> 05:07:21,340
Yeah, I decided to actually swap immediately because I like
you guys too much and I would have thrown on that character.

4211
05:07:23,380 --> 05:07:24,440
There she is!

4212
05:07:24,480 --> 05:07:25,140
Help this guy!

4213
05:07:25,380 --> 05:07:26,040
Save him!

4214
05:07:26,060 --> 05:07:27,140
Somebody help this guy!

4215
05:07:27,860 --> 05:07:28,820
I'm never playing Groot again.

4216
05:07:29,140 --> 05:07:29,540
Look at him!

4217
05:07:29,580 --> 05:07:29,920
Look at him!

4218
05:07:29,980 --> 05:07:30,300
Look at him!

4219
05:07:30,340 --> 05:07:30,660
He's weird!

4220
05:07:30,700 --> 05:07:31,740
Oh my god, what the fuck is going?

4221
05:07:31,820 --> 05:07:32,860
I'm so fucking confused.

4222
05:07:33,180 --> 05:07:34,720
I also do not like this map anyway.

4223
05:07:36,720 --> 05:07:37,880
I have to use this.

4224
05:07:38,580 --> 05:07:39,720
They used too much.

4225
05:07:39,920 --> 05:07:40,860
They got my lamps.

4226
05:07:41,180 --> 05:07:42,240
But he's one, though.

4227
05:07:43,780 --> 05:07:44,500
I'm back.

4228
05:07:44,780 --> 05:07:44,960
I'm back.

4229
05:07:45,100 --> 05:07:45,280
I'm back.

4230
05:07:47,720 --> 05:07:52,920
I just thought it was- I usually don't talk about these type
of tweets, but I thought it was so fucking funny because you

4231
05:07:52,920 --> 05:07:53,300
know they're not.

4232
05:07:53,320 --> 05:08:02,320
Marvel Rivals viewer It's a big, you know, they don't play

How?

4236
05:08:14,100 --> 05:08:22,020
It wasn't even damage boosted Oh my god That's right What
was that?

4237
05:08:22,200 --> 05:08:26,900
It wasn't even damage boosted That's crazy.

4238
05:08:37,740 --> 05:08:38,040
Alright.

4239
05:08:39,040 --> 05:08:40,660
I got it.

4240
05:08:40,780 --> 05:08:42,020
Wait, what is...

4241
05:08:42,020 --> 05:08:44,140
I'm gonna have to actually glow cloak actually.

4242
05:08:45,320 --> 05:08:46,260
I think I'm gonna have to go cloak.

4243
05:08:46,360 --> 05:08:47,320
They're going hard, Dad.

4244
05:08:50,800 --> 05:08:52,580
Um, I don't think we did it.

4245
05:08:53,860 --> 05:08:55,060
I had to use this.

4246
05:08:55,180 --> 05:08:58,000
I had to do this so we can have our little...

4247
05:08:58,000 --> 05:08:58,460
Oh, we can die.

4248
05:08:59,300 --> 05:09:00,480
Oh, we didn't even get one of them up here.

4249
05:09:00,720 --> 05:09:01,640
Wait, we didn't even get one of them.

4250
05:09:03,840 --> 05:09:05,880
No, we have...

4251
05:09:06,940 --> 05:09:08,880
It's not because we have the...

4252
05:09:10,940 --> 05:09:11,700
There you go.

4253
05:09:14,340 --> 05:09:19,940
It's not better because, like, the bubble is better to play
around with.

4254
05:09:19,940 --> 05:09:21,320
No, you're gonna get rock and I'm...

4255
05:09:21,320 --> 05:09:22,940
Oh, I don't want to die the other time, but...

4256
05:09:22,940 --> 05:09:23,600
Oh my god, is that golden?

4257
05:09:23,840 --> 05:09:24,140
Is that golden?

4258
05:09:24,140 --> 05:09:25,080
I'm gonna let him build all.

4259
05:09:25,260 --> 05:09:26,460
I'm gonna build...

4260
05:09:26,460 --> 05:09:27,460
There you go, whose lives.

05:09:28,160 --> 05:09:28,580

05:09:29,660 --> 05:09:30,720
I mean, I could have used lap.

4264
05:09:30,800 --> 05:09:31,780
I could have used laps.

4265
05:09:31,880 --> 05:09:37,520
It's not better in the case where like wait, yo, hey

Oh,

4293
05:12:13,920 --> 05:12:17,400
I wasn't risking it.

4294
05:12:23,980 --> 05:12:25,320
What was that?

4295
05:12:25,380 --> 05:12:26,820
Oh, wait, it's the guy in the tournament!

4296
05:12:27,100 --> 05:12:28,460
Tyler won tournament, right?

4297
05:12:29,640 --> 05:12:30,460
Sorry, here we go.

4298
05:12:31,040 --> 05:12:31,640
That's him.

4299
05:12:33,080 --> 05:12:33,360
Yeah.

4300
05:12:34,780 --> 05:12:35,900
Sorry, my...

4301
05:12:35,900 --> 05:12:36,420
Yeah, we're going.

4302
05:12:37,760 --> 05:12:38,860
Alright, I'm sorry.

4303
05:12:39,380 --> 05:12:40,860
Everything is blurring together here.

4304
05:12:41,040 --> 05:12:42,200
I think Spidey's on the right somewhere.

4305
05:12:42,680 --> 05:12:43,320
I'm gonna do it.

4306
05:12:43,480 --> 05:12:44,020
I love that.

4307
05:12:44,460 --> 05:12:45,260
I'm gonna do it.

4308
05:12:46,180 --> 05:12:47,340
What are you gonna do to me?

4309
05:12:48,120 --> 05:12:51,400
I'm gonna run here just in case I fucking knew it.

4310
05:12:54,880 --> 05:12:57,660
Oh my god, please, please come.

4311
05:12:57,720 --> 05:13:00,260
I made a whole journey to come back.

4312
05:13:01,360 --> 05:13:02,340
Wait, what?

4313
05:13:02,420 --> 05:13:04,100
How do we not push up?

4314
05:13:07,720 --> 05:13:10,420
I like had an entire journey.

4315
05:13:10,860 --> 05:13:12,060
How did we not push up?

4316
05:13:12,060 --> 05:13:16,180
I've only done this map like two or three times and I don't
think I've ever successfully made around this corner.

4317
05:13:19,220 --> 05:13:20,800
How far strange are the TP?

4318
05:13:21,740 --> 05:13:22,440
Don't look spidey.

4319
05:13:22,940 --> 05:13:25,860
Well, it wasn't spidey.

4320
05:13:26,260 --> 05:13:26,470
It wasn't...

4321
05:13:27,160 --> 05:13:27,860
You can walk though.

4322
05:13:27,980 --> 05:13:28,940
We're like kind of close.

4323
05:13:29,840 --> 05:13:30,760
We won't be actually walking.

4324
05:13:31,200 --> 05:13:33,380
To be fair, we didn't have...

4325
05:13:33,380 --> 05:13:34,000
You gotta touch it.

4326
05:13:35,540 --> 05:13:37,120
No, it was so close.

4327
05:13:37,400 --> 05:13:42,000
The current score is 1, 2, 0.

4328
05:13:44,400 --> 05:13:45,220
I didn't even realize.

4329
05:13:45,460 --> 05:13:46,820
I was like, where's everybody?

4330
05:13:53,480 --> 05:13:56,020
We are hope and fear.

4331
05:14:09,070 --> 05:14:11,390
All right, here we go.

4332
05:14:13,210 --> 05:14:14,790
I hate this map.

4333
05:14:17,570 --> 05:14:20,450
I really hate this map in general.

4334
05:14:22,450 --> 05:14:25,100
It helps me see the darkness and face it.

4335
05:14:32,260 --> 05:14:32,280
Oh.

4336
05:14:34,500 --> 05:14:41,680
I think this map is just, it's very, I don't like the map
design colors in general.

4337
05:14:43,220 --> 05:14:50,700
Uh, and I just don't like the map colors and also like, I
don't like this concept.

4338
05:14:51,560 --> 05:14:52,920
It feels way, I don't know.

4339
05:14:53,800 --> 05:14:56,780
I don't like the wall concept and like, I don't like how.

4340
05:14:57,920 --> 05:15:09,540
I'll uh yes sir oh yeah no I knew it was actually him he
just didn't know it was actually me you good dude I just

4341
05:15:09,540 --> 05:15:25,500

just surprised you can fall off oh we a hard dive I think

4342
05:15:25,500 --> 05:15:28,020

4343
05:15:28,280 --> 05:15:32,980
Oh, maybe you should have alt tabbed, bro.

4344
05:15:34,980 --> 05:15:37,980
Bro, I think he alt tabbed and he fucked up.

4345
05:15:39,040 --> 05:15:43,720
I think he alt tabbed and he fucked up.

4346
05:15:49,060 --> 05:15:50,520
We gotta think I'm back.

4347
05:15:51,840 --> 05:15:54,220
Yeah, my game is like lagging somewhere like Spider-Man or
something.

4348
05:15:55,600 --> 05:15:56,120
Here we go.

4349
05:15:56,340 --> 05:15:56,920
We're going in.

4350
05:15:57,660 --> 05:16:10,220
I'm hoping I'm helping all right that's good I'm getting

Oh no.

4355

Oh no.

4356
05:16:37,540 --> 05:16:39,220
The hard time!

4357
05:16:41,560 --> 05:16:45,060
I won't be surprised if one of these players is EU.

4358
05:16:47,860 --> 05:16:49,420
The hard time.

4359
05:16:50,340 --> 05:16:51,520
You gotta ask to play.

4360
05:16:51,960 --> 05:16:52,760
We have to play triple.

4361
05:16:53,840 --> 05:16:56,600
We have to play triple, but I don't think they want to play
triple.

4362
05:16:57,280 --> 05:17:06,100
fuck you though instead if he gets it fast enough we gotta
play triple for this but i don't know if my team if they

4363
05:17:06,100 --> 05:17:11,360
play hard dive it's just triple there's nothing else we can
do grab

4364
05:17:15,960 --> 05:17:30,320
well i'm going to be doing this because i don't want to die
all right technically i can do this And then, but we are...

4365
05:17:30,320 --> 05:17:32,280
Okay, we didn't...

4366
05:17:32,920 --> 05:17:33,500
Oh, God.

4367
05:17:35,020 --> 05:17:35,580
We...

4368
05:17:36,640 --> 05:17:38,580
We sort of...

4369
05:17:38,580 --> 05:17:40,560
Oh, we didn't...

4370
05:17:42,980 --> 05:17:43,540
Oh...

4371
05:17:43,540 --> 05:17:48,320
I saved her a lot, but we sort of didn't.

4372
05:17:49,080 --> 05:17:49,940
I'm trying to see you.

4373
05:17:53,140 --> 05:17:53,700
But...

4374
05:17:53,700 --> 05:17:55,540
Oh, in our back, to the right.

4375
05:17:55,760 --> 05:17:56,240
Oh, my God.

4376
05:17:56,260 --> 05:17:57,000

05:18:00,060 --> 05:18:02,380
We have I'm gonna let her build up.

4378
05:18:02,420 --> 05:18:03,180
I'm gonna build up.

4379
05:18:06,100 --> 05:18:08,240
Oh, that's my strange.

4380
05:18:17,280 --> 05:18:17,720
I knew it.

4381
05:18:21,780 --> 05:18:23,240

05:18:29,360 --> 05:18:30,440
Okay, they have nothing left.

4386
05:18:30,980 --> 05:18:33,020
Oh my god, three more minutes of this!

4387
05:18:34,940 --> 05:18:37,040
Three more minutes of help.

4388
05:18:38,060 --> 05:18:41,700
You gotta be really careful of Moon Idol.

4389
05:18:42,340 --> 05:18:43,520
Holy shit.

4390
05:18:44,000 --> 05:18:48,420
Three more minutes of this.

4391
05:18:49,260 --> 05:18:51,480
I'm gonna use a lot of them.

4392
05:18:52,120 --> 05:18:52,360
Yeah.

4393
05:18:53,320 --> 05:18:54,020
Bring that.

4394
05:19:00,160 --> 05:19:00,500
Bring that.

4395
05:19:00,860 --> 05:19:02,420
This is real firepower.

4396
05:19:02,640 --> 05:19:04,780
This is bad because I...

4397
05:19:13,250 --> 05:19:15,450
I'm just gonna use this for my team.

4398
05:19:16,250 --> 05:19:21,490
I hope my I'm just hoping my front line win my front line
We're gonna play out of it

4399
05:19:24,550 --> 05:19:28,730
Oh, no, don't mess with the amazing spider-man.

4400
05:19:29,770 --> 05:19:30,790
Oh, no

4401
05:19:34,690 --> 05:19:38,550
Oh, no, no, we can't TP.

4402
05:19:41,450 --> 05:19:42,750
We can't TP.

4403
05:19:45,750 --> 05:19:47,230
We're going to TP!

4404
05:19:47,910 --> 05:19:49,870
We- Good game.

4405
05:19:49,990 --> 05:19:50,310
Nice try.

4406
05:19:53,550 --> 05:19:54,850
I had a feeling.

4407
05:19:54,970 --> 05:19:56,900
I was like, oh, it's three minutes of hell.

4408
05:19:58,010 --> 05:19:59,990
Well, we can't expect to win them all.

4409
05:20:04,040 --> 05:20:08,360
At least people caught- at least that was the most positive
game we've had.

4410
05:20:08,580 --> 05:20:14,500
Our second most- our second game out of four hours where
people were nice.

4411
05:20:14,620 --> 05:20:26,080
yeah they they game two of people not yelling at each other
you know yeah it was a pretty positive time i hope you guys

4412
05:20:26,080 --> 05:20:30,780
are appreciating the fact that i'm sacrificing my elo to
show you guys uh

4413
05:20:34,120 --> 05:20:36,220
show you guys weekend queues

4414
05:20:47,190 --> 05:20:55,890
the elo true the loss is temporarily that i can get it back
easily when i'm I'm not playing at this time of day.

4415
05:21:01,280 --> 05:21:03,080
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

4416
05:21:14,360 --> 05:21:15,260
What are you stopping?

4417
05:21:15,840 --> 05:21:17,380
What's the thrill of that?

4418
05:21:20,420 --> 05:21:23,040
What's the fun in just stopping?

4419
05:22:02,330 --> 05:22:02,830
All right.

4420
05:22:03,350 --> 05:22:04,570
Here we go.

4421
05:22:16,030 --> 05:22:18,370
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

4422
05:22:18,630 --> 05:22:19,850
Here we go.

4423
05:22:20,710 --> 05:22:22,090
Do I have another support player?

4424
05:22:23,090 --> 05:22:35,990
if all right let's play in this quietly into the background
i'm tired but i am ready i'm currently bro

4425
05:22:39,170 --> 05:22:54,030
okay reset reset the clock we gotta reset The clock.

4426
05:23:05,470 --> 05:23:06,590
The

4427
05:23:10,160 --> 05:23:15,180
game hasn't even started yet.

4428
05:23:15,960 --> 05:23:20,180
It's time to reset the clock, everyone.

4429
05:23:23,880 --> 05:23:27,800
The battle starts in five, four, three,

4430
05:23:31,560 --> 05:23:33,260
That's crazy.

4431
05:23:38,100 --> 05:23:39,100
Maybe,

4432
05:23:42,840 --> 05:23:44,600
guys, maybe we'll have...

4433
05:23:44,600 --> 05:23:48,440
Maybe the enemy team will also have a throw, guys.

4434
05:23:50,040 --> 05:23:51,220
We can hope.

4435
05:23:52,100 --> 05:23:54,120
We can still hope.

4436
05:23:54,920 --> 05:23:55,540
We...

4437
05:23:55,540 --> 05:23:58,180
Just throw the...

4438
05:23:58,320 --> 05:24:00,500
Guys, there's still hope.

4439
05:24:01,540 --> 05:24:04,600
Oh my god, they have a black bastard.

4440
05:24:04,960 --> 05:24:05,660
There's still hope.

4441
05:24:06,240 --> 05:24:08,120
They have a black bastard, guys.

4442
05:24:09,140 --> 05:24:11,260
There's actual hope.

4443
05:24:13,300 --> 05:24:13,820
Wait.

4444
05:24:15,040 --> 05:24:16,100
Is this a war?

4445
05:24:18,920 --> 05:24:22,060
This witch team can throw harder.

4446
05:24:22,680 --> 05:24:23,780
Let's let it go.

4447
05:24:25,300 --> 05:24:26,520
There's still hope.

4448
05:24:29,680 --> 05:24:39,000
it's still possible wait a minute wait they have a jet too
it's still possible

4449
05:24:47,550 --> 05:24:59,150
you know that's fine someone basic i think someone on the
enemy team instant dc the moment they realized they were

4450
05:24:59,150 --> 05:25:05,570
losing because elo was that important No fucking way.

4451
05:25:07,410 --> 05:25:08,970
Also, was it this guy?

4452
05:25:10,790 --> 05:25:13,310
Well, that guy was so positive earlier.

4453
05:25:13,770 --> 05:25:15,550
Why is he like this now?

4454
05:25:17,350 --> 05:25:20,190
I didn't want that one anyway.

4455
05:25:20,990 --> 05:25:21,670
That's true.

4456
05:25:22,250 --> 05:25:23,930
I didn't want that one.

4457
05:25:24,950 --> 05:25:26,130
Oh my god, I got him.

4458
05:25:26,270 --> 05:25:28,090
Okay, let's hope that maybe he won't.

4459
05:25:28,470 --> 05:25:28,670
Maybe.

4460
05:25:36,860 --> 05:25:39,140
Which hero do you think will be today?

4461
05:25:44,950 --> 05:25:47,350
Maybe it'll be different.

4462
05:25:53,400 --> 05:25:55,560
Who am I gonna banish from this match?

4463
05:25:56,040 --> 05:25:57,400
Maybe it'll be different.

4464
05:26:20,060 --> 05:26:22,100
All right, here we go.

4465
05:26:23,740 --> 05:26:24,260
All right.

4466
05:26:27,260 --> 05:26:28,760
Never mind, my bad, my bad.

4467
05:26:32,900 --> 05:26:34,420
Please don't throw.

4468
05:26:42,620 --> 05:26:43,620
All right, here we go.

4469
05:26:49,010 --> 05:26:50,030
Hope was...

4470
05:26:50,370 --> 05:26:52,210
It's okay, I can still hope.

4471
05:26:54,590 --> 05:26:55,430
Hoping is fine.

4472
05:26:56,190 --> 05:26:59,070
Like, I can still feel hope.

4473
05:26:59,510 --> 05:27:00,830
I can...

4474
05:27:16,940 --> 05:27:17,400
Hmm.

4475
05:27:27,100 --> 05:27:27,380
Oh?

4476
05:27:27,740 --> 05:27:28,160
Honestly.

4477
05:27:29,020 --> 05:27:29,680
Alright, cough.

4478
05:27:30,760 --> 05:27:37,180
Whatever happens, if it's a fast match, if it's a slow
match, whatever happens.

4479
05:27:38,340 --> 05:27:39,240
Bro, I will show...

4484
05:28:13,260 --> 05:28:17,700
During my other rival streams are non-rival queues.

4485
05:28:20,580 --> 05:28:22,560
Yeah, I gotta fucking stop feeling hope.

4486
05:28:23,380 --> 05:28:24,980
That was my first mistake.

4487
05:28:25,340 --> 05:28:27,060
I felt...

4488
05:28:28,200 --> 05:28:29,040

Oh my god.

4494
05:28:39,860 --> 05:28:41,040

As long as we don't lose a fight, we win.

4504
05:29:32,730 --> 05:29:34,810
Invis just tried to take a fight with me.

4505
05:29:35,730 --> 05:29:37,250
He only lived because he's more than healed.

4506
05:29:37,690 --> 05:29:38,790

That's okay, they used everything.

4519
05:31:03,990 --> 05:31:06,210
I don't remember how to say hello in Rylos.

4520
05:31:07,390 --> 05:31:09,570
Oh, I'm gonna need you to one-shot their cloak out of their
ult.

4521
05:31:10,690 --> 05:31:12,930
I mean, I could try if you want me to just push up an ult.

4522
05:31:15,330 --> 05:31:17,330

05:31:17,330 --> 05:31:17,950

I don't know where it's safe.

4527
05:31:32,790 --> 05:31:35,250
Little does he know I had nothing.

4528
05:31:36,610 --> 05:31:37,930
Little does he know!

4529
05:31:38,410 --> 05:31:42,630
Oh my god.

4530
05:31:43,270 --> 05:31:44,550
Supports are not even on the nest.

4531
05:31:45,330 --> 05:31:45,490
Ready?

4532
05:31:45,670 --> 05:31:46,510

05:31:52,610 --> 05:31:53,570
I'm frozen.

4534
05:31:56,310 --> 05:31:57,690
I... I don't know what's going on.

4535
05:31:58,110 --> 05:31:58,110
I got it.

4536
05:31:58,150 --> 05:31:59,090
I keep getting CC'd.

4537
05:31:59,210 --> 05:31:59,890

05:32:03,330 --> 05:32:05,110
I'm getting tossed around, bro.

4540
05:32:05,310 --> 05:32:05,970
I don't know what's happening.

4541
05:32:10,190 --> 05:32:11,150

4544
05:32:13,570 --> 05:32:14,270
Who will win?

4545
05:32:14,410 --> 05:32:15,310
Help me, help me, help me, help me!

4546
05:32:20,590 --> 05:32:21,330

4547
05:32:21,330 --> 05:32:22,150
I'm scared.

4548
05:32:25,190 --> 05:32:27,310
I'm so scared now.

4549
05:32:29,350 --> 05:32:30,550
They look like they mean business.

4550
05:32:31,010 --> 05:32:31,550
Spending a character.

4551
05:32:34,710 --> 05:32:40,040
We got a spider.

4552
05:32:40,180 --> 05:32:41,720
Oh my god, I...

4553
05:32:41,720 --> 05:32:42,480

4556
05:32:45,280 --> 05:32:45,780
He's alive!

4557
05:32:50,800 --> 05:32:51,960

Wait, is that hell even old?

4563
05:33:39,260 --> 05:33:39,740
Did I miss it?

4564
05:33:39,980 --> 05:33:40,240
Nope.

4565
05:33:40,700 --> 05:33:43,240
I think she wanted to, but she died in her cloak and dagger
old.

4566
05:33:43,400 --> 05:33:45,880
It feels good to step outside my bubble every now and then.

4567
05:33:46,360 --> 05:33:47,580
Yeah, we just like out-damaged her.

4568
05:33:48,000 --> 05:33:50,160
I think her and Invis both died.

4569
05:33:51,280 --> 05:33:51,400
Oh.

4570
05:33:53,700 --> 05:33:57,120
Yeah, I'm gonna try to save my green for the silo, but she's
gonna try to bait it out.

4571
05:33:58,060 --> 05:33:58,880
Ashwin, a book.

4572
05:34:00,800 --> 05:34:01,380
Death

05:34:04,570 --> 05:34:06,890
would make you an excellent assassin.

4574
05:34:07,650 --> 05:34:14,730

god what is that i'm sorry but what i'm sorry but um Bro,
you see the throw on me?

4635
05:39:47,130 --> 05:39:48,290
Stop picking heels.

4636
05:39:54,570 --> 05:39:57,790
Oh my god, and then...

4637
05:39:57,790 --> 05:39:58,130
What?

4638
05:40:03,210 --> 05:40:04,850
Oh my god, what?

4639
05:40:06,050 --> 05:40:06,250
What?

4640
05:40:07,150 --> 05:40:07,630
What the?

4641
05:40:08,630 --> 05:40:10,650
You can capitalize on that.

4642
05:40:12,790 --> 05:40:14,370
Oh my god.

4643
05:40:17,610 --> 05:40:18,390
I

4644
05:40:28,360 --> 05:40:38,440
Um Why does she run away from the point?

4645
05:40:40,140 --> 05:40:41,340
Why did she?

4646
05:40:42,300 --> 05:40:47,240
Why did she but the sword can't kill you if you're alting
on?

4647
05:40:50,550 --> 05:41:01,640
She left the point with her alt I was so confused and then
she blamed our DPS and was like, I'm sorry is on me and I'm

4648
05:41:01,640 --> 05:41:12,760
like, but but you all did off point That doesn't excuse the
all off point

4649
05:41:19,260 --> 05:41:22,480
We all saw that right?

4650
05:41:29,780 --> 05:41:33,120
I look, I was like, where did she go?

4651
05:41:34,660 --> 05:41:35,600
Where did she go?

4652
05:41:36,400 --> 05:41:40,300
Oh, that's unlucky.

4653
05:41:46,020 --> 05:41:47,620
Oh, that's unlucky.

4654
05:41:48,300 --> 05:41:49,200
We're not living that.

4655
05:41:49,800 --> 05:41:52,340
Looks like the mission area is yours to capture now.

4656
05:41:58,100 --> 05:42:20,460
I was unfortunate I feel it was just the craziest shit I saw
I was just like oh man I just we want to live this look see

4657
05:42:20,460 --> 05:42:25,140
we got we live it oh my god See, this is why I turn off
effects.

4658
05:42:25,380 --> 05:42:25,900
I hate.

4659
05:42:26,460 --> 05:42:27,920
I forgot to turn off that effect.

4660
05:42:29,820 --> 05:42:31,200
Because, like, I...

4661
05:42:39,010 --> 05:42:40,430
I personally, I hate it.

4662
05:42:40,510 --> 05:42:42,350
I hate the effects so much.

4663
05:42:42,610 --> 05:42:44,050
Because it's so hard to see.

4664
05:42:44,130 --> 05:42:46,290
The only good one is the cloak one.

4665
05:42:46,810 --> 05:42:49,270
But, like, personally, I just...

4666
05:42:49,270 --> 05:42:50,330
I'm just not a fan.

4667
05:42:50,470 --> 05:42:51,710
It's just so much clutter.

4668
05:42:51,770 --> 05:42:52,710
It's way too much clutter.

4669
05:42:52,830 --> 05:42:53,550
Like, yeah, it's cool.

4670
05:42:53,670 --> 05:42:56,450
But it's just literally too much clutter for my screen.

4671
05:43:02,130 --> 05:43:08,110
i mean i'm trying to oh my god i'm trying very hard to keep
you up right now

4674
05:43:43,950 --> 05:43:46,670
This is actually trolling

4675
05:43:56,790 --> 05:44:04,700
Oh my god, that's awkward I wanted to fight close

4676
05:44:10,580 --> 05:44:13,140
Oh fuck what?

4677
05:44:13,940 --> 05:44:24,960

4679
05:44:32,900 --> 05:44:49,020

i have to swap off there's no reason to play I will admit

4680
05:44:49,020 --> 05:44:50,880
whenever I fucked up that was a misbe.

4681
05:44:52,880 --> 05:44:55,340
That was 100% a misbebe.

4682
05:44:57,240 --> 05:44:59,100
Yeah, just so much better.

4683
05:45:04,120 --> 05:45:04,440
Really?

4684
05:45:04,900 --> 05:45:05,780
Oh, yay!

4685
05:45:06,760 --> 05:45:08,420
Oh my god, yay!

4686
05:45:11,440 --> 05:45:12,900
Where is he?

4687
05:45:13,280 --> 05:45:13,760
Whoa!

4688
05:45:14,980 --> 05:45:15,400
There we go.

4689
05:45:15,640 --> 05:45:16,520
Yeah, heals!

4690
05:45:16,700 --> 05:45:17,380
Free heals!

4691
05:45:18,300 --> 05:45:19,600
Anyways, good game.

4692
05:45:21,500 --> 05:45:22,660
Oh, he's TPing, guys.

4693
05:45:22,820 --> 05:45:23,700
Oh, yay!

4694
05:45:25,740 --> 05:45:26,460
Yippee!

4695
05:45:27,460 --> 05:45:30,980
Other than that one time, I play that shit perfectly.

4696
05:45:33,940 --> 05:45:35,300
The counter-swap.

4697
05:45:35,640 --> 05:45:36,780
Oh, my God, man.

4698
05:45:37,380 --> 05:45:38,740
Counter-swap rivals.

4699
05:45:45,930 --> 05:45:46,650
Yippee!

4700
05:45:54,010 --> 05:45:54,730
Yay!

4701
05:46:01,650 --> 05:46:02,770
Yippee!

4702
05:46:03,570 --> 05:46:04,450
Look at that, see?

4703
05:46:06,170 --> 05:46:10,170
Technically, it's still two games of positivity.

4704
05:46:12,830 --> 05:46:17,130
still only two games where people were positive.

4705
05:46:24,910 --> 05:46:25,310
Too long.

4706
05:46:26,030 --> 05:46:31,090
I've been live for for six hours.

4707
05:46:31,830 --> 05:46:37,650
It's still only it's still only two games.

4708
05:46:46,710 --> 05:46:49,170
What a wild six hours it's been.

4709
05:47:07,470 --> 05:47:08,450
Alright, here we go.

4710
05:47:19,030 --> 05:47:20,830
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

4711
05:47:28,250 --> 05:47:28,810
Alright.

4712
05:47:29,670 --> 05:47:31,230
I'm tired, boss.

4713
05:47:31,530 --> 05:47:32,730
Well, that's too damn bad.

4714
05:47:33,170 --> 05:47:34,270
We're in here for it.

4715
05:47:34,370 --> 05:47:34,930
We're in here.

4716
05:47:35,270 --> 05:47:35,830
Ride or die.

4717
05:47:39,330 --> 05:47:39,790
Alright.

4718
05:48:21,150 --> 05:48:33,950
oh well we're not trying we're just hanging out we're just
we're not really trying anymore it's more that we're just

4719
05:48:33,950 --> 05:48:35,530
hanging out now

4720
05:48:45,180 --> 05:48:48,720
we're i'm the e-o-m-m demon

4721
05:49:16,210 --> 05:49:24,330
all right All right Log in and oh shit.

4722
05:49:24,570 --> 05:49:30,070
All right, wait, okay, this is doable now I tap back in and
I'm like all right.

4723
05:49:30,310 --> 05:49:35,030
Oh All right What monsters have you slain

4724
05:49:41,960 --> 05:49:54,900
the battle starts in five four three two one All you need to
do is capture the mission area got it From what I hear about

4725
05:49:54,900 --> 05:50:05,180
this doom carriage I don't think I'm gonna like them very
much All right, here we go Yep It's okay, surely no one's

4726
05:50:05,180 --> 05:50:06,380
gonna die

4727
05:50:10,000 --> 05:50:18,020
Surely no one else is gonna die Guys, um, please stay away
from the enemy Groot Wall, it's really hard to tell, but it

4728
05:50:18,020 --> 05:50:19,000
is Red

4729
05:50:22,080 --> 05:50:29,840
I know it is a little Difficult to tell, but the difference
between our group walls and the enemy group wall is that it

4730
05:50:29,840 --> 05:50:31,160
is red.

4731
05:50:32,420 --> 05:50:36,880
So if you are getting hit by the enemy group walls...

4732
05:50:37,640 --> 05:50:38,280
Alright.

4733
05:50:38,700 --> 05:50:38,700
Oh.

4734
05:50:39,040 --> 05:50:39,940
Oh, that's unlucky.

4735
05:50:43,080 --> 05:50:43,680
Yay!

4736
05:50:49,720 --> 05:50:51,160
Oh, I gotta stop.

4737
05:50:51,260 --> 05:50:52,280
I gotta heal now.

4738
05:50:54,740 --> 05:50:56,340
Oh, let's hope they're alive.

4739
05:50:56,500 --> 05:50:58,500
Okay, that's good because I turned around.

4740
05:50:59,080 --> 05:51:00,300
I turned around.

4741
05:51:00,320 --> 05:51:02,620
I was like, I hope everybody's okay.

4742
05:51:03,440 --> 05:51:05,300
I accidentally turned around.

4743
05:51:08,820 --> 05:51:09,580
All right.

4744
05:51:12,760 --> 05:51:15,260
What if they're colorblind, Doki?

4745
05:51:15,960 --> 05:51:19,720
Well, there's colorblind mode.

4746
05:51:22,580 --> 05:51:25,200
That can't be an excuse, guys.

4747
05:51:25,360 --> 05:51:26,600
Oh my god, I can't climb that wall.

4748
05:51:27,000 --> 05:51:31,300
I've just learned that wall is apparently unclimable.

4749
05:51:32,080 --> 05:51:36,280
I was trying to climb that wall with my fucking life

4750
05:51:39,800 --> 05:51:42,580
Guys guys you're on the group enemy group wall.

4751
05:51:42,800 --> 05:51:44,320
You're on the enemy group wall.

4752
05:51:44,600 --> 05:51:48,640
You're on Oh my god, he got four kills

4753
05:51:52,830 --> 05:52:06,910
He deserved it Little hope little hope I just saw them all

life of me really need you to not do that i mean like okay

4759
05:53:22,070 --> 05:53:23,030
why we are

4760
05:53:26,590 --> 05:53:27,490
It's okay.

4761
05:53:27,830 --> 05:53:29,290
He used the...

4762
05:53:29,290 --> 05:53:30,450
He used the...

4763
05:53:33,890 --> 05:53:34,890
It's okay.

4764
05:53:36,690 --> 05:53:37,630
Did he do it?

4765
05:53:37,790 --> 05:53:39,150
Oh, they stacked.

4766
05:53:40,310 --> 05:53:40,990
Unfortunate.

4767
05:53:41,450 --> 05:53:42,190
I'm surprised.

4768
05:53:42,790 --> 05:53:43,610
Oh my god.

4769
05:53:43,750 --> 05:53:46,210
Wait, is this a shotgun Punisher player?

4770
05:53:48,730 --> 05:53:50,510
We're not living that.

4771
05:53:52,910 --> 05:53:54,890
I wasn't even gonna...

4772
05:53:54,950 --> 05:54:07,250
I need you to lock in I wasn't even I mean all the people
lock in I need two points Two points is all I need um most

4773
05:54:07,250 --> 05:54:09,230
likely maybe I go

4774
05:54:13,600 --> 05:54:15,700
This is someone's like me up.

4775
05:54:15,860 --> 05:54:25,120
Oh Yeah, I don't think it's up just stop lucky that needs to
lock in that I really don't think

4776
05:54:31,280 --> 05:54:33,240
Where am I?

4777
05:54:34,360 --> 05:54:38,760
Get in the old brother, what are you doing?

4778
05:54:42,720 --> 05:54:44,580
I'm gonna go close.

4779
05:54:44,940 --> 05:54:46,220
I'm gonna...

4780
05:54:46,220 --> 05:54:48,980
You're taking for the raid, take it, thank you.

4781
05:54:51,340 --> 05:54:51,560
Oh.

4782
05:54:54,920 --> 05:54:57,360
Yo, can we get off like Punisher and like...

4783
05:54:57,380 --> 05:55:05,810
you know we're surprisingly having two characters that are i
mean we're playing punisher bucket but to be fair this guy

4784
05:55:07,200 --> 05:55:16,560
against the hulk at a group surely sure i'm sure my team is
gonna do more than me right the crazy part is that we have

4785
05:55:16,560 --> 05:55:32,020
those two yet somehow there is a lot of walls bye everybody
i'd be nice to talk everybody guys great job no i think the

4786
05:55:32,020 --> 05:55:43,220
crazy no this guy this punisher and bucky i'm sure we could
not like spare them or something i don't know like that no i

4787
05:55:43,220 --> 05:55:54,240
know the meow meow meow count is somebody i've or like not
someone just i recognize that name from count i don't

4788
05:55:54,240 --> 05:55:57,840
remember who because i was like yeah yeah that's a funny one

4789
05:56:05,840 --> 05:56:12,540
the thing about the crazy part about why people are like
complaining about our bucky and stuff is because um

4790
05:56:18,040 --> 05:56:19,680
it's because they

4791
05:56:23,900 --> 05:56:28,780
oh we were not supposed to use that with us but oh no

4792
05:56:33,440 --> 05:56:38,720
It's because, like, Punisher and Bucky is supposed to be
able to...

4793
05:56:38,720 --> 05:56:40,600
It's supposed to be able to...

4794
05:56:41,620 --> 05:56:43,440
Shoot the walls, but yet somehow...

4795
05:56:44,580 --> 05:56:45,180
Somehow!

4796
05:56:46,040 --> 05:56:46,920
I don't know how!

4797
05:56:47,300 --> 05:56:49,740
But our walls are not breaking.

4798
05:56:52,640 --> 05:56:57,220
Like, none of the walls are breaking, and I don't know why.

4799
05:57:00,740 --> 05:57:10,840
No I fucked that up Oh, guys, I couldn't get in yeah, I just

That's fine.

4801
05:57:16,260 --> 05:57:17,000
That's crazy

4802
05:57:20,240 --> 05:57:27,360
I don't know why I'm like if I see Punisher, it might look
like the game To win this one because like if you do not

4803
05:57:27,360 --> 05:57:32,700
know how to play Punisher it shows you don't know how to
play Bucky It shows it's obvious it's okay hey i got boosted

or like not i don't even take the bare minimum where people

4810
05:58:27,100 --> 05:58:29,460
said nothing mean.

4811
05:58:33,820 --> 05:58:39,080
Two games where people said nothing mean.

4812
05:58:43,440 --> 05:58:49,310
I can't see the three of you up there by the way.

4813
05:58:49,550 --> 05:58:50,770

05:58:54,610 --> 05:58:56,650
It really was that many.

05:59:01,940 --> 05:59:03,560
Oh, we're on heal pool.

4817
05:59:03,900 --> 05:59:05,020
Oh, yeah, no, it's over.

4818
05:59:06,560 --> 05:59:08,700
That guy has stopped, Gary.

4819
05:59:13,280 --> 05:59:14,380
I know it's someone.

4820
05:59:14,560 --> 05:59:15,920
I just don't know who it is.

4821
05:59:17,300 --> 05:59:23,620
Only because, um, I was like, meow, meow, man, that's such a
crazy, that's such a weird-ass name.

4822
05:59:26,740 --> 05:59:27,580
Alright, I take it back.

4823
05:59:27,660 --> 05:59:28,540
This cop is cooking them.

4824
05:59:33,920 --> 05:59:34,720
Alright, here we go.

06:00:18,800 --> 06:00:20,060
Like, what can you do?

4829
06:00:20,660 --> 06:00:24,600
I'll get those two points some other time, I guess.

4830
06:00:32,700 --> 06:00:35,000
Holy fuck, bro.

4831
06:00:35,720 --> 06:00:39,420
Like, the player is so bad.

4832
06:00:40,840 --> 06:00:43,940
Oh my god!

4833
06:00:48,090 --> 06:00:49,530
We're in life.

4834
06:00:49,930 --> 06:00:49,930
That

4835
06:00:54,850 --> 06:00:56,530
is much better.

4836
06:00:56,850 --> 06:00:58,050
Oh my god.

or not I I can't tell if they're throwing or not though I I

4842
06:01:39,730 --> 06:01:50,070
can't tell I just remembered who it is I can't tell they
could be throwing this could be actually their skill level

4843

4848
06:02:44,690 --> 06:02:45,970
Oh, man.

4849
06:02:48,550 --> 06:02:50,270
Oh, man.

4850
06:02:55,140 --> 06:02:58,880
Alright, let's get them out of here.

4851
06:02:59,380 --> 06:03:00,940
Who sold you there?

4852
06:03:27,980 --> 06:03:29,560
That's crazy.

4853
06:03:47,050 --> 06:03:48,790
I'm tired, Bob.

4854
06:03:50,050 --> 06:03:52,510
You needed two points, guys.

4855
06:03:53,410 --> 06:03:54,530
Two points.

4856
06:03:55,850 --> 06:03:56,690
Bro, you need...

4857
06:03:56,690 --> 06:03:58,350
It's alright, bro, you need two points.

4858
06:03:58,810 --> 06:04:00,430
You picked the wrong day to queue.

4859
06:04:00,870 --> 06:04:02,890
I'm literally playing because I know...

4860
06:04:02,890 --> 06:04:05,990
I know what I'm getting into playing in these lobbies.

4861
06:04:06,430 --> 06:04:09,670
But I think you have to not play in these lobbies.

4862
06:04:09,670 --> 06:04:11,790
You have to not play on the weekend.

4863
06:04:12,010 --> 06:04:14,330
If you really need those two points.

4864
06:04:16,070 --> 06:04:24,930
know what i'm getting into on the weekend because i always
get my points back in the end when i don't play on saturday

4865
06:04:24,930 --> 06:04:35,570
or sunday oh he's back you think he'll get us now he well he
needs two more games now you know what just because he had a

4866
06:04:35,570 --> 06:04:37,810
bad day i'll go in viz

4867
06:04:56,940 --> 06:04:59,860
just because he had a very bad day

4868
06:05:22,150 --> 06:05:24,410
He deserves some hope.

4869
06:05:29,350 --> 06:05:30,750
Oh, Invis got bad.

4870
06:05:31,130 --> 06:05:32,750
Well, I guess I'll cook it up.

4871
06:06:10,570 --> 06:06:11,530
All right, here we go.

4872
06:06:11,670 --> 06:06:13,970
Let's pop back up under their nose.

4873
06:06:14,110 --> 06:06:16,670
Do you think the world is ever going to be a good one?

4874
06:06:17,470 --> 06:06:18,410
All right, here we go.

4875
06:06:20,970 --> 06:06:22,290
Surely it'll be fine now.

4876
06:06:25,070 --> 06:06:27,270
It's gonna be okay.

4877
06:06:30,550 --> 06:06:31,750
I believe.

4878
06:06:33,510 --> 06:06:36,670
Oh, Phoenix is bad so I could technically play Rocket.

4879
06:06:38,430 --> 06:06:40,870
You have to stop them from securing the mission area.

4880
06:06:42,250 --> 06:06:42,890
Oh my god.

4881
06:06:43,050 --> 06:06:43,670
Are you guys okay?

4882
06:06:53,150 --> 06:06:53,530
Oh.

4883
06:06:59,180 --> 06:06:59,780
Oh.

4884
06:07:00,420 --> 06:07:01,500
Maybe I should.

4885
06:07:02,000 --> 06:07:02,020
Nice.

4886
06:07:02,600 --> 06:07:02,920
Nice.

4887
06:07:03,220 --> 06:07:03,820
I think we had life.

4888
06:07:04,080 --> 06:07:04,680
Blunky.

4889
06:07:06,380 --> 06:07:16,880
oh there's a hell of my goodness yeah that's what he said
just now oh he is peaking way too much and you're not like

4890
06:07:16,880 --> 06:07:20,540
that oh

4891
06:07:24,400 --> 06:07:32,280
that blasphemy guy just plays whatever the fuck he wants and
wait now he gets every hook possible okay yeah that's what i

4892
06:07:32,280 --> 06:07:42,800
was saying i was like i was like remember when i was like
guys i have a i know who this guy is and like it is a 50 50

4893
06:07:42,800 --> 06:07:59,000
on whether or not this guy is throwing or if he's trying and
yet now he's having the most generational play yeah he was

4894
06:07:59,000 --> 06:08:01,700
throwing brother

4895
06:08:05,120 --> 06:08:07,580
Oh, I am not falling for your rage fate.

4896
06:08:11,140 --> 06:08:12,020
All right.

4897
06:08:19,050 --> 06:08:21,310
I think I don't know if you started.

4898
06:08:21,550 --> 06:08:21,970
I don't know.

4899
06:08:23,270 --> 06:08:24,950
That's why I was like, guys, I.

4900
06:08:27,670 --> 06:08:29,930
Okay, I have to use that because.

4901
06:08:31,310 --> 06:08:34,570
I don't want to come back now because I don't trust my so.

4902
06:08:36,310 --> 06:08:36,750
See?

4903
06:08:37,750 --> 06:08:38,590
See?

4904
06:08:40,690 --> 06:08:43,150
Now you see what I mean?

4905
06:08:43,790 --> 06:08:48,750
Yet somehow he hooks everything.

4906
06:08:51,530 --> 06:08:54,730
Now he's hooking every single thing now.

4907
06:08:55,510 --> 06:08:58,050
That's why I was like...

4908
06:08:58,050 --> 06:09:00,210
I know who it is.

4909
06:09:00,630 --> 06:09:01,830
I was just like, hmm.

4910
06:09:09,400 --> 06:09:10,760
Okay, right.

4911
06:09:10,780 --> 06:09:11,280
Okay, wait.

4912
06:09:13,560 --> 06:09:15,620
Oh my god, thank god.

4913
06:09:15,880 --> 06:09:16,500
Oh thank god.

4914
06:09:16,820 --> 06:09:18,100
But also not.

4915
06:09:20,960 --> 06:09:21,560
Must have been a mistake.

4916
06:09:23,380 --> 06:09:23,740
Nope.

4917
06:09:24,460 --> 06:09:26,880
Played it up perfectly.

4918
06:09:31,430 --> 06:09:32,130
Nope.

4919
06:09:37,380 --> 06:09:39,240
Okay, now I know.

4920
06:09:44,840 --> 06:09:48,900
This is why I meet the animals insane.

4921
06:09:49,020 --> 06:10:01,880
of his life and he's cute and he's doing with the relaxed
guy he's doing with the relaxed guy

4922
06:10:07,760 --> 06:10:18,140
by the 2018 where he was flame I don't think I remember
somebody flamed me no we played me last game I don't

4923
06:10:18,140 --> 06:10:27,780
remember that I don't remember anyone flaming me last oh
that's that's an important I don't even, that's unfortunate

4924
06:10:27,780 --> 06:10:29,340
we couldn't.

4925
06:10:29,540 --> 06:10:30,260
There's two behind us.

4926
06:10:31,380 --> 06:10:32,940
Yeah, I don't even think we win this.

4927
06:10:34,460 --> 06:10:35,220
I don't remember.

4928
06:10:36,340 --> 06:10:37,100
I remember.

4929
06:10:38,500 --> 06:10:40,280
His name was Zaza something.

4930
06:10:40,600 --> 06:10:41,520
I throw for Zaza.

4931
06:10:43,820 --> 06:10:46,700
Oh no, you're, it's a wrong guy, wrong guy.

4932
06:10:46,920 --> 06:10:48,320
His name was throw for Zaza.

4933
06:10:48,760 --> 06:10:49,200
Tight deal.

4934
06:10:51,540 --> 06:10:52,880
Yeah, that's not the BP.

4935
06:10:55,360 --> 06:10:56,240
I remember.

4936
06:10:56,420 --> 06:10:57,680
I remember the names.

4937
06:10:58,900 --> 06:10:59,280
All right.

4938
06:11:02,040 --> 06:11:03,200
All right, here we go.

4939
06:11:03,560 --> 06:11:04,480
Let's hope we...

4940
06:11:04,480 --> 06:11:06,520
Oh, get ready for that portal, guys.

4941
06:11:12,250 --> 06:11:13,130
There we go.

4942
06:11:23,180 --> 06:11:23,680
All right.

4943
06:11:29,510 --> 06:11:30,090
Who got hit?

4944
06:11:30,290 --> 06:11:30,950
Oh, our mag.

4945
06:11:31,450 --> 06:11:32,230
He's got to live.

4946
06:11:32,310 --> 06:11:33,090
He's got to live.

4947
06:11:33,150 --> 06:11:34,470
Our mag's got to live until...

4948
06:11:34,470 --> 06:11:38,930
Okay, now he doesn't have to live, but it will be good if he
does live.

4949
06:11:39,470 --> 06:11:39,790
No.

4950
06:11:41,910 --> 06:11:45,210
It will be very good if he does live.

4951
06:11:46,190 --> 06:11:48,090
All right, three more minutes of this.

4952
06:11:54,500 --> 06:11:55,080
Three more minutes.

4953
06:11:55,220 --> 06:11:55,800
We can do this.

4954
06:11:58,640 --> 06:12:00,240
I think I should go back to D-Gen Qs.

4955
06:12:00,400 --> 06:12:02,080
D-Gen Qs are at least more fun.

4956
06:12:05,020 --> 06:12:06,300
I will have to admit...

4957
06:12:07,460 --> 06:12:08,640
What the fuck?

4958
06:12:09,760 --> 06:12:13,880
I will have to admit, D-Gen Qs might actually be better and
improved.

4959
06:12:14,540 --> 06:12:15,910
It's a weekend game.

4960
06:12:20,440 --> 06:12:21,640
Oh, yes, somehow.

4961
06:12:22,860 --> 06:12:24,460
Wait, what hooked me?

4962
06:12:24,700 --> 06:12:25,900
Oh, wait, it's a...

4963
06:12:27,540 --> 06:12:29,900
This is true, true.

4964
06:12:31,300 --> 06:12:31,580
Alright.

4965
06:12:32,120 --> 06:12:33,900
I have a little...

4966
06:12:42,180 --> 06:12:43,220
Alright, here we go.

4967
06:12:49,570 --> 06:12:49,930
Oh.

4968
06:12:50,030 --> 06:12:51,150
There's a group behind us.

4969
06:13:00,010 --> 06:13:11,090
I will say I think legitimately DJing queues is a is much
better than the whatever these queues are

4970
06:13:14,970 --> 06:13:22,610
DJing queues are 100 much better than whatever the fuck this
is oh no he's trying now

4971
06:13:31,680 --> 06:13:32,640
Oh, no.

4972
06:13:34,720 --> 06:13:35,380
Oh, no.

4973
06:13:35,500 --> 06:13:36,860
The widow's trying now.

4974
06:13:37,660 --> 06:13:38,300
Oh, no.

4975
06:13:39,420 --> 06:13:40,020
That's...

4976
06:13:40,020 --> 06:13:41,440
Don't you hate it?

4977
06:13:43,380 --> 06:13:45,220
He's trying now.

4978
06:13:47,360 --> 06:13:48,180
Maybe I'll reach him.

4979
06:13:48,260 --> 06:13:49,180
Oh, my God, it did!

4980
06:13:51,200 --> 06:13:53,100
I do have to grab up, though.

4981
06:13:56,400 --> 06:13:59,180
Yeah, I went at a hard to test that theory up.

4982
06:14:03,100 --> 06:14:06,460
I hope he knows that I do have to build a halt up.

4983
06:14:06,780 --> 06:14:08,700
I really do need a build up.

4984
06:14:10,020 --> 06:14:10,620
Oh, no.

4985
06:14:13,840 --> 06:14:14,800
I have

4986
06:14:18,760 --> 06:14:20,960
to just die.

4987
06:14:21,500 --> 06:14:22,900
I don't think we can win this.

4988
06:14:23,500 --> 06:14:24,500
We have to die here.

4989
06:14:25,200 --> 06:14:26,420
I'm not wasting my health for that.

4990
06:14:26,540 --> 06:14:27,220
We lost three.

4991
06:14:30,720 --> 06:14:32,380
I should get out in time.

4992
06:14:37,550 --> 06:14:39,790
Yeah, I wasn't going to waste my health for this.

4993
06:14:39,970 --> 06:14:40,710
Oh,

4994
06:14:47,600 --> 06:14:48,180
that's unlucky.

4995
06:14:50,260 --> 06:14:51,000
Okay, I...

4996
06:14:51,000 --> 06:14:53,500
There you go.

4997
06:14:54,780 --> 06:14:55,080
Yep.

4998
06:15:04,400 --> 06:15:06,140
Oh, I couldn't do anything.

4999
06:15:08,820 --> 06:15:10,520
Yeah, it was unlucky.

5000
06:15:10,800 --> 06:15:14,860
The current score is 0, 2, 3.

5001
06:15:15,820 --> 06:15:15,860
Oh!

5002
06:15:16,460 --> 06:15:17,400
Time to switch things up.

5003
06:15:18,100 --> 06:15:19,520
Oh, right now.

5004
06:15:19,660 --> 06:15:20,440
Thank you for the torch brown.

5005
06:15:20,640 --> 06:15:20,800
Thank you.

5006
06:15:21,100 --> 06:15:21,520
Thank you.

5007
06:15:23,420 --> 06:15:24,200
Thanks, guys.

5008
06:15:24,940 --> 06:15:27,400
See, I think...

5009
06:15:28,000 --> 06:15:36,480
Unfortunately, for a guy here, for a two-points guy, it
might...

5010
06:15:36,480 --> 06:15:38,620
You might need three more games, buddy.

5011
06:15:39,520 --> 06:15:41,420
It might...

5012
06:15:41,420 --> 06:15:43,060
It could be winnable.

5013
06:15:52,490 --> 06:15:53,350
Round two!

5014
06:15:53,550 --> 06:15:54,330
We have powers.

5015
06:15:54,730 --> 06:15:54,990
We have...

5016
06:16:05,240 --> 06:16:08,280
It might become four games even.

5017
06:16:14,100 --> 06:16:15,880
I think it's just...

5018
06:16:17,900 --> 06:16:18,780
Oh wait, wait, wait.

5019
06:16:18,860 --> 06:16:19,700
What happened to our second tank?

5020
06:16:19,860 --> 06:16:20,560
Oh no.

5021
06:16:22,020 --> 06:16:23,960
It's okay, we don't need a second tank.

5022
06:16:24,700 --> 06:16:26,020
This always happens.

5023
06:16:27,180 --> 06:16:27,760
See, that's the thing.

5024
06:16:27,800 --> 06:16:32,700
I'm at the Q Dodge because I don't know who that guy, like I
know who he is.

5025
06:16:33,120 --> 06:16:35,580
But I don't know who he's throwing for it.

5026
06:16:36,980 --> 06:16:37,560
Could be me.

5027
06:16:37,760 --> 06:16:39,120
It could be the guy that...

5028
06:16:39,880 --> 06:16:40,640
It could be...

5029
06:16:40,640 --> 06:16:41,940
It could also be...

5030
06:16:41,940 --> 06:16:47,160
Honestly, it could be the guy that was, like, non-stop,
like, talking shit.

5031
06:16:57,220 --> 06:17:00,160
Because, like, he's playing Hella now, too.

5032
06:17:00,900 --> 06:17:02,600
Because the other guy is also...

5033
06:17:02,600 --> 06:17:04,000
I don't know who the other guy is.

5034
06:17:04,060 --> 06:17:05,920
I know who Meow, Meow, Meow is.

5035
06:17:06,600 --> 06:17:08,480
But I don't know who the other guy is.

5036
06:17:14,160 --> 06:17:18,320
I know who I won't say who it is but

5037
06:17:22,360 --> 06:17:28,520
I know for sure the other guy is playing with him I have no
idea which one he was doing

5038
06:17:33,340 --> 06:17:42,560
because then the other guy also by the way I think we all
saw what he was doing on Punisher wait He was, he was

5039
06:17:42,560 --> 06:17:49,960

absolutely not given a fuck.

5040
06:17:50,360 --> 06:17:58,580
He, I don't know if you guys saw it, but he was literally
like, oh my god, he was literally just like taking zipline

5041
06:17:58,580 --> 06:18:03,600

Oh, no.

5210
06:35:59,160 --> 06:36:03,200
Now they have only mild to rely on, guys.

5211
06:36:05,600 --> 06:36:06,120
Don't worry.

5212
06:36:06,620 --> 06:36:08,540

5213
06:36:11,850 --> 06:36:12,950

5214
06:36:14,610 --> 06:36:16,110

5222
06:37:34,820 --> 06:37:36,140
You are nothing!

5223
06:37:42,200 --> 06:37:44,400
Good news is...

5224
06:37:45,180 --> 06:37:47,320
There's no good news actually.

5225
06:37:47,780 --> 06:37:49,020
There's no...

5226
06:37:50,020 --> 06:37:53,880
Why are you playing heal pool?

5227
06:37:54,560 --> 06:37:55,720
No strength can't force.

5228
06:37:56,820 --> 06:37:58,000
Oh my god.

5229
06:37:58,020 --> 06:38:00,440

5233
06:38:09,800 --> 06:38:10,920

06:38:11,940 --> 06:38:12,740

5245
06:39:14,020 --> 06:39:16,020
The whole pass left the game.

5246
06:39:16,780 --> 06:39:17,620

5247
06:39:17,620 --> 06:39:18,260

They hit a checkpoint.

5255
06:39:45,970 --> 06:39:48,010
Now might be a good time to stop them.

5256
06:39:52,730 --> 06:39:55,970
5-4-3-4.

5257
06:39:58,090 --> 06:39:59,370

5258
06:40:01,190 --> 06:40:03,930
Thing goes upwards.

5259
06:40:05,750 --> 06:40:17,890
I will say that if anybody's gonna get blamed right now, I
don't...

5260
06:40:19,510 --> 06:40:24,770
It may or may not be...

5261
06:40:26,110 --> 06:40:27,750

06:46:17,940 --> 06:46:19,340
It's still two games.

5311
06:46:20,100 --> 06:46:21,760
It has not stopped me.

5312
06:46:22,900 --> 06:46:25,960
Still two games where people are not toxic.

5313
06:46:28,260 --> 06:46:30,800
I hope someone else is pushing this.

5314
06:46:31,100 --> 06:46:32,660
Because I'm...

5315
06:46:36,160 --> 06:46:38,120
I hope they're all okay.

5316
06:46:46,110 --> 06:46:49,170
Oh my god, we're still going in?

5317
06:46:49,930 --> 06:46:50,790
We're just back.

5318
06:46:50,910 --> 06:46:51,910
We're still...

5319
06:46:53,690 --> 06:47:00,550

fucking go, man, let's do this, let's fucking do this, I

5322
06:47:24,350 --> 06:47:24,990
guess?

5323
06:47:32,100 --> 06:47:34,600
Normally I wouldn't, but then I was like, you know what?

5324
06:47:36,380 --> 06:47:37,580
You guys really want to?

5325
06:47:37,740 --> 06:47:38,360
You know what?

5326
06:47:42,240 --> 06:47:45,060
All right, so this might be where like it ends.

5327
06:47:48,060 --> 06:47:48,620
Unless...

5328
06:47:48,620 --> 06:47:49,940
No, no more.

5329
06:47:50,460 --> 06:47:51,600
This is where it stops.

5330
06:47:53,720 --> 06:47:56,560
This is where it stops, maybe.

5331
06:48:00,940 --> 06:48:02,330
All right, here we go.

5332
06:48:03,520 --> 06:48:04,660
Bro, it's a 1v2.

5333
06:48:04,740 --> 06:48:06,000
I don't know, buddy.

5334
06:48:07,180 --> 06:48:07,640
There.

5335
06:48:11,300 --> 06:48:12,500
I mean, they have a little key.

5336
06:48:12,560 --> 06:48:16,280
It'd be pretty neat if we had someone go third support.

5337
06:48:17,520 --> 06:48:18,820
Please, I really need those.

5338
06:48:18,980 --> 06:48:20,220
Please, someone go goats.

5339
06:48:20,680 --> 06:48:21,800

5340
06:48:24,940 --> 06:48:25,500
There is.

5341
06:48:35,300 --> 06:48:38,400

You know, came back a little.

5348
06:49:41,300 --> 06:49:43,300
Oh, he got fucking blind.

5349

I think my, oh my god, I have to be the fucking...

5350
06:49:47,000 --> 06:49:50,020
That actually was the fucking thing of the century.

5351
06:49:54,440 --> 06:49:56,060
But, I can't.

5352
06:49:57,840 --> 06:49:58,800
There we go.

5353
06:50:01,880 --> 06:50:02,520
Hello.

5354
06:50:05,460 --> 06:50:06,080
Hello.

5355
06:50:07,300 --> 06:50:08,880
I came back for this.

5356
06:50:11,580 --> 06:50:13,160
I came back for it.

5357
06:50:13,320 --> 06:50:14,740
Alright, back to pushing cart.

5358
06:50:15,400 --> 06:50:18,060
I mean, I would love to push cart, really, honestly.

5359
06:50:18,820 --> 06:50:22,020
I would love to push cart right now.

5360
06:50:27,400 --> 06:50:28,040
I...

5361
06:50:29,000 --> 06:50:29,640
For...

5362
06:50:36,510 --> 06:50:39,610
Oh, are we okay?

5363
06:50:47,220 --> 06:50:48,240
Where's our teammates?

5364
06:50:53,380 --> 06:50:54,440
My mouse died.

5365
06:50:55,080 --> 06:50:55,880
My mouse died.

5366
06:50:56,500 --> 06:50:57,240
Oh, my God.

5367
06:50:58,140 --> 06:50:59,660
I forgot to charge my mouse.

5368
06:51:03,890 --> 06:51:05,590
I'll be a die regardless, though.

5369
06:51:05,670 --> 06:51:06,210
Not going to lie.

5370
06:51:06,810 --> 06:51:19,190
Okay, that wasn't really a throw because, like, fucking dead
I was not living that I was actually no I don't know you

5371
06:51:19,190 --> 06:51:35,810
guys know that but that was it was not a winnable fight for
me hundred percent I was so fucking dead oh that's good oh

5372
06:51:35,810 --> 06:51:46,630
my god it's so close oh my god oh All right, here we go.

5373
06:51:56,010 --> 06:51:58,310
Oh, my God.

5374
06:51:58,750 --> 06:52:00,390
Do we keep...

5375
06:52:00,390 --> 06:52:01,590
Here we go, I guess.

5376
06:52:09,570 --> 06:52:11,530
Oh, my God.

5377
06:52:12,210 --> 06:52:13,550
Oh, it's not winnable.

5378
06:52:14,370 --> 06:52:15,590
Oh, no.

5379
06:52:16,310 --> 06:52:19,030
It might not be winnable, guys.

5380
06:52:20,410 --> 06:52:25,210
They have Alt Advantage and we have Heal Pool.

5381
06:52:29,470 --> 06:52:30,830
We have...

5382
06:52:34,610 --> 06:52:39,210
We have Heal Pool and we don't know where the portal...

5383
06:52:40,070 --> 06:52:43,090
Oh my god and this is the portal!

5384
06:52:43,610 --> 06:52:45,010
Oh my...

5385
06:52:47,990 --> 06:52:51,050
You know, we did make it pretty far with Heal Pool.

5386
06:52:53,250 --> 06:52:56,350
Wait, we made it pretty far.

5387
06:53:00,070 --> 06:53:01,990
Heal pull is not... Tank pull is better.

5388
06:53:02,230 --> 06:53:03,910
Heal pull is not great with deal of support.

5389
06:53:04,810 --> 06:53:05,970
I would personally think.

5390
06:53:09,290 --> 06:53:11,330
It was a good try.

5391
06:53:12,550 --> 06:53:13,770
It really was.

5392
06:53:20,080 --> 06:53:21,440
I'm so...

5393
06:53:26,550 --> 06:53:27,470
I'm so...

5394
06:53:27,470 --> 06:53:29,470
I'm going to reset the clock.

5395
06:53:30,430 --> 06:53:31,070
Reset one.

5396
06:53:31,130 --> 06:53:52,000
day I'll find I'll find a player one day guys reset the
clock two games and no more no that guy that guy did not let

5397
06:53:52,000 --> 06:54:17,960
any shot I got I literally I was like how did I how did I
die and then I I looked at his cam and I was like oh no he

5398
06:54:17,960 --> 06:54:31,700
literally needed hit one shot on the hot guy and it was like
miss miss miss miss and he gave up I don't know I don't know

5399
06:54:32,480 --> 06:54:47,020
it but he actually gave up in the end I'm trying to shoot
him in the replay I fire and I missed again and I fired and

5400
06:54:47,020 --> 06:55:00,880
I missed and I fired and I missed again I don't know I think
it's insane that he that he missed and then gave up he gave

5401
06:55:00,880 --> 06:55:03,780
up why did he Did he give up?

5402
06:55:06,420 --> 06:55:10,060
He didn't use like, it's not, this is not my day.

5403
06:55:10,240 --> 06:55:11,980
I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna keep going.

5404
06:55:12,180 --> 06:55:13,640
It's not my day right now.

5405
06:55:16,000 --> 06:55:17,680
It's not my day.

5406
06:55:20,600 --> 06:55:24,960
Well, I don't think any rank is, is like, okay right now.

5407
06:55:25,100 --> 06:55:27,160
Not during Sunday and Saturday.

5408
06:55:30,420 --> 06:55:32,320
Not during either of those days.

5409
06:55:39,060 --> 06:55:41,200
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

5410
06:55:48,560 --> 06:55:53,300
Alright, remember I have to like Start trying, I pick Invis.

5411
06:55:53,620 --> 06:55:55,720
That's crazy, my mouse died in the middle of it.

5412
06:55:55,800 --> 06:55:56,940
I want to order that new mouse.

5413
06:55:57,740 --> 06:55:59,120
I still want to order that new mouse.

5414
06:56:08,810 --> 06:56:12,170
Yeah, I do ranked from Celestia too.

5415
06:56:15,910 --> 06:56:17,850
To be fair, that's on me.

5416
06:56:18,090 --> 06:56:26,210
I feel like there were I feel like, okay, I will say there
were maybe five games that I personally threw, like, not

5417
06:56:26,210 --> 06:56:33,410
through, but like, like, I would say, like, four to five
games that I didn't play my best, but the rest of the games

5418
06:56:33,410 --> 06:56:41,030
were, was actually, like, pure, RNG, just people screaming
at each other.

5419
06:56:46,250 --> 06:56:55,710
I don't know we all saw that right there were so lots of the
games were pretty much like unwinnable on hero select and

5420
06:56:55,710 --> 06:56:59,770
then people just started screaming at each other we all saw
it

5421
06:57:03,080 --> 06:57:09,260
I can play rocket now I play I'm playing this I'll play in
this just to play for my team

5422
06:57:21,260 --> 06:57:22,480
I heard it.

5423
06:57:22,920 --> 06:57:27,360
Yeah, I was just like, oh, I'm just like, huh.

5424
06:57:33,140 --> 06:57:35,500
Cosmic rays didn't make me who I am today.

5425
06:57:36,240 --> 06:57:37,160
My family did.

5426
06:57:37,800 --> 06:57:39,020
Yup, anyone here?

5427
06:57:39,440 --> 06:57:40,680
30 seconds before you attack.

5428
06:57:41,080 --> 06:57:41,460
Get ready.

5429
06:57:41,480 --> 06:57:41,980
Let's see.

5430
06:57:42,580 --> 06:57:46,640
I'm gonna double check my, check my mouse.

5431
06:57:47,020 --> 06:57:47,900
I have seen you, sister.

5432
06:57:48,640 --> 06:57:49,460
How fair you?

5433
06:57:50,220 --> 06:57:52,380
I have no desire for small talk.

5434
06:57:52,560 --> 06:57:54,340
All right, how much has it charged?

5435
06:57:54,540 --> 06:57:56,420
12%, okay, that's not a lot.

5436
06:57:57,680 --> 06:57:59,600
All right, I'll let it charge for one game.

5437
06:58:02,720 --> 06:58:03,960
I hate Wired Mouse.

5438
06:58:04,320 --> 06:58:05,140
Wired Mouse is not it.

5439
06:58:05,920 --> 06:58:08,920
I'm not, I'm not a fan of Wired Mouse in general.

5440
06:58:09,960 --> 06:58:13,080
It's just, I just don't like, it just feels very annoying to
play with.

5441
06:58:15,380 --> 06:58:15,820
Yeah.

5442
06:58:16,400 --> 06:58:17,740
I forgot to go right side.

5443
06:58:17,840 --> 06:58:19,040
We're on the upper other side.

5444
06:58:19,280 --> 06:58:22,360
I was so used to being on the opposite side.

Oh my god.

5459
07:00:33,020 --> 07:00:33,820
Why did we leave?

5460
07:00:34,000 --> 07:00:34,900
Why did we leave?

5461
07:00:38,720 --> 07:00:40,040
No, but thank you for the raid.

5462
07:00:40,400 --> 07:00:40,700
Thank you.

5463
07:00:40,780 --> 07:00:42,140
Oh, we had a great stream.

5464
07:00:42,960 --> 07:00:45,120
That's awkward that we left floating there.

5465
07:00:45,440 --> 07:00:46,020
I was like, what?

5466
07:00:46,420 --> 07:00:46,640
What?

5467
07:00:46,820 --> 07:00:47,500
Why are you...

5468
07:00:47,500 --> 07:00:50,520
Our mag is so scared for no reason.

5469
07:00:53,460 --> 07:00:55,120
There's a higher default DPI.

5470
07:00:57,020 --> 07:00:59,300
All right, I'm gonna have to fix that then.

5471
07:01:00,500 --> 07:01:01,640
I did not know that.

5472
07:01:01,900 --> 07:01:03,180
Okay, he's...

5473
07:01:03,180 --> 07:01:05,880
Oh, that was so cute though, but...

5474
07:01:05,880 --> 07:01:06,280
Oh, nice.

5475
07:01:10,420 --> 07:01:12,200
All right, I'm trying to help.

5476
07:01:13,480 --> 07:01:14,320
Fantastic on me.

5477
07:01:19,020 --> 07:01:20,320
All right, here, you're fine.

5478
07:01:20,820 --> 07:01:21,680
You're so healthy!

5479
07:01:22,600 --> 07:01:23,560
And I have a look!

5480
07:01:26,420 --> 07:01:28,940
Okay, Spider-Man's gonna try and grab me.

5481
07:01:29,300 --> 07:01:30,940
Uh-oh.

5482
07:01:34,280 --> 07:01:34,580
Nice.

5483
07:01:34,940 --> 07:01:36,120
Atty Rank from Celestia.

5484
07:01:38,140 --> 07:01:41,040
At least somebody's having a good weekend kill.

5485
07:01:42,400 --> 07:01:44,620
Not me, unfortunately.

5486
07:01:46,840 --> 07:01:47,860
Bad to use that.

5487
07:01:48,000 --> 07:01:49,280
I was really weird.

5488
07:01:49,480 --> 07:01:51,020
Oh, it's fine.

5489
07:01:57,930 --> 07:01:59,370

Oh, oh, guys, we're just one.

5497
07:03:03,740 --> 07:03:04,100
So what?

5498
07:03:04,220 --> 07:03:04,800
I got you.

5499
07:03:05,480 --> 07:03:06,780
He's got an alt, though.

5500
07:03:07,600 --> 07:03:08,540
So I don't know.

5501
07:03:10,900 --> 07:03:11,700
He still has alpha.

5502
07:03:18,220 --> 07:03:19,680
Alright, let me double check.

5503
07:03:19,760 --> 07:03:21,440
I'm going to check my mouse settings then.

5504
07:03:21,640 --> 07:03:24,500
I did not know that it does default.

5505
07:03:25,180 --> 07:03:27,080
It changes my mouse DPI.

5506
07:03:28,120 --> 07:03:29,420
Nope, it's still 800.

5507
07:03:31,880 --> 07:03:32,820
It's still 800.

5508
07:03:32,840 --> 07:03:33,160
100.

5509
07:03:34,060 --> 07:03:34,940
That's weird.

5510
07:03:39,010 --> 07:03:39,430
Alright.

5511
07:03:41,550 --> 07:03:45,210
See, when I start having to try, I play in this.

5512
07:03:47,230 --> 07:03:48,870
When I just want to chill.

5513
07:03:50,990 --> 07:03:51,530
Yes.

5514
07:03:52,930 --> 07:03:53,550
Mouse acceleration.

5515
07:03:53,670 --> 07:03:54,430
It could be mouse acceleration.

5516
07:03:55,210 --> 07:03:58,890
But to be fair, I like never do this shit, mouse
acceleration, for some reason.

5517
07:03:59,530 --> 07:04:00,630
I'm not...

5518
07:04:00,630 --> 07:04:01,430
That's the thing.

5519
07:04:01,470 --> 07:04:07,250
When people were hard criticizing High Guard, they were
like, Oh, the motion blur was always on.

5520
07:04:07,430 --> 07:04:08,470
I can't fucking see shit.

5521
07:04:08,750 --> 07:04:11,110
And like, oh my gosh, the frames, the frames.

5522
07:04:11,470 --> 07:04:15,430
But I'm like, uh, but their eyes are better than mine
because they're pro.

5523
07:04:15,830 --> 07:04:18,550
So it's like, for me, I was like, I hate that.

5524
07:04:20,230 --> 07:04:21,050
Photo queue sucks.

5525
07:04:21,610 --> 07:04:22,970
That was like my major.

5526
07:04:23,610 --> 07:04:24,630
That was my major.

5527
07:04:24,890 --> 07:04:26,150
I didn't even notice the crouch.

5528
07:04:26,470 --> 07:04:30,790
I, I, I didn't like, I feel like the one thing I definitely
should have noticed was the crouch top.

5529
07:04:30,890 --> 07:04:33,350
There was no, uh, there was no hold toggle.

5530
07:04:34,690 --> 07:04:39,730
thing i i was like oh i didn't even notice about that i
should have noticed it

5531
07:04:44,350 --> 07:04:53,090
i had to use that but there's a there's a fantastic on your
food

5532
07:04:57,210 --> 07:05:07,710
it's fine it's fine i planned so planned Behold the god of
thunder!

5533
07:05:07,850 --> 07:05:08,270
Oh!

5534
07:05:15,570 --> 07:05:18,030
Oh my, that was just way too much damage.

5535
07:05:18,870 --> 07:05:20,570
It was just way too much damage.

5536
07:05:24,070 --> 07:05:26,410
That was a thin screen right there.

5537
07:05:26,530 --> 07:05:29,650
You shall see the extraordinary power of the trickster
goddess.

5538
07:05:31,070 --> 07:05:32,830
An opportunity for combat.

5539
07:05:34,190 --> 07:05:37,530
But yeah, I definitely should have noticed that there was no
holes to toggle.

5540
07:05:37,690 --> 07:05:41,850
I did find it very fucking weird that my Like crouching.

5541
07:05:42,150 --> 07:05:43,010
I mean, hold it to crouch.

5542
07:05:43,750 --> 07:05:45,270
I was just like, whoa, what?

5543
07:05:45,490 --> 07:05:47,170
It felt like that.

5544
07:05:47,170 --> 07:05:47,510
Again?

5545
07:05:48,170 --> 07:05:49,430
That's so fast.

5546
07:05:50,090 --> 07:05:50,610
He can die.

5547
07:05:50,710 --> 07:05:51,330
He can die.

5548
07:05:52,890 --> 07:05:54,570
I thought you said he can die.

5549
07:05:55,030 --> 07:05:55,210
I'm not gonna heal.

5550
07:05:55,410 --> 07:05:55,650
Please.

5551
07:05:56,870 --> 07:05:57,970
I'm the only person not full.

5552
07:06:00,690 --> 07:06:01,530
I didn't see.

5553
07:06:01,650 --> 07:06:02,290
I'm sorry.

5554
07:06:03,070 --> 07:06:04,010
If I knew.

5555
07:06:21,900 --> 07:06:23,640
Oh my god.

5556
07:06:24,240 --> 07:06:25,640
She can die.

5557
07:06:27,340 --> 07:06:29,620
Oh, what the fuck?

5558
07:06:32,480 --> 07:06:33,620
It worked out.

5559
07:06:33,820 --> 07:06:34,380
It worked out.

5560
07:06:35,120 --> 07:06:35,820
Everything worked out.

5561
07:06:36,920 --> 07:06:38,220
Everything worked out.

5562
07:06:39,460 --> 07:06:40,140
Everything worked out.

5563
07:06:40,520 --> 07:06:45,600
It all worked out.

5564
07:06:47,140 --> 07:06:48,380
Wait, you're up really far.

5565
07:06:57,820 --> 07:07:04,120
I don't know how.

5566
07:07:09,620 --> 07:07:09,680
Maybe.

5567
07:07:16,100 --> 07:07:17,520
Here's what they are looking at.

5568
07:07:21,420 --> 07:07:22,460
Oh my god.

5569
07:07:23,400 --> 07:07:23,860
That's good.

5570
07:07:26,140 --> 07:07:26,980
Oh fuck.

5571
07:07:27,120 --> 07:07:27,260
I hear you.

5572
07:07:27,280 --> 07:07:28,760
realized she was still alive.

5573
07:07:29,880 --> 07:07:30,880
That was my bad.

5574
07:07:32,100 --> 07:07:33,980
I legitimately thought she was dead.

5575
07:07:39,280 --> 07:07:39,600
Get him!

5576
07:07:39,980 --> 07:07:40,560
Get him!

5577
07:07:40,660 --> 07:07:43,140
No more no bubble no bubble.

5578
07:07:43,300 --> 07:07:45,500
I fucking took him off of the high ground.

5579
07:07:47,240 --> 07:07:47,840
Oh no.

5580
07:07:50,320 --> 07:07:52,420
I didn't know I was under it.

5581
07:07:53,720 --> 07:07:55,380
I didn't know I was under it.

5582
07:07:56,920 --> 07:07:59,320
I didn't know I was under it.

5583
07:07:59,800 --> 07:08:03,200
circle it's okay it's winnable

5584
07:08:06,280 --> 07:08:15,600
yes it's supposed to happen because when the map moves well
technically it's not technically that's not supposed to

5585
07:08:15,600 --> 07:08:21,020
happen but it's a it's a game bug that's still like this

5586
07:08:24,780 --> 07:08:32,040
it's not supposed to be like that The curse is broken.

5587
07:08:34,940 --> 07:08:35,620
Nice.

5588
07:08:37,080 --> 07:08:38,380
I had to just play Sue.

5589
07:08:39,420 --> 07:08:40,920
I really did.

5590
07:08:45,600 --> 07:08:47,660
I usually have Donga.

5591
07:08:51,630 --> 07:08:53,830
I have to avoid this guy.

5592
07:08:56,350 --> 07:08:58,850
I have to avoid this guy.

5593
07:08:59,090 --> 07:09:09,850
I'm sorry, but I don't want no heal pooling by team i really
don't i nearly all right that should be that should be

5594
07:09:09,850 --> 07:09:23,490
enough yeah yeah bottom don't bottom bump bump bump bump
bump bump bump bump bump all right let me and see how much

5595
07:09:23,490 --> 07:09:31,290
my battery charged i don't expect to stream this long today
but i know i don't know why are those streaming rivals 30

5596
07:09:31,290 --> 07:09:33,370
percent you know what I'll leave it charged until our game.

5597
07:09:34,530 --> 07:09:34,770
Yelpua!

5598
07:09:34,970 --> 07:09:36,650
Yelpua's just fucking ass.

5599
07:09:37,770 --> 07:09:40,070
Yelpua is fucking ass on dual support.

5600
07:09:41,030 --> 07:09:43,670
If you're doing triple support, it's fine.

5601
07:09:43,950 --> 07:09:45,030
It's just...

5602
07:09:45,930 --> 07:09:47,190
Not dual support.

5603
07:09:53,690 --> 07:09:54,710
I'll go low key.

5604
07:09:55,130 --> 07:09:56,290
I'll play for the win.

5605
07:09:57,710 --> 07:09:58,410
Tank pool is the best.

5606
07:09:58,470 --> 07:09:58,930
No, it is.

5607
07:09:59,350 --> 07:09:59,830
100%.

5608
07:09:59,830 --> 07:10:00,650
Tank pool.

5609
07:10:00,790 --> 07:10:02,830
It's tank pool, heal pool, and then DPS pool.

5610
07:10:08,150 --> 07:10:09,350
But even then...

5611
07:10:09,370 --> 07:10:12,790
If you're gonna play triple support, you play Mantis triple
support.

5612
07:10:13,050 --> 07:10:13,990
Why the fuck would you play?

5613
07:10:14,610 --> 07:10:18,710
Why the fuck would you ever play triple support with...

5614
07:10:19,390 --> 07:10:19,910
With...

5615
07:10:19,910 --> 07:10:22,770
Healpool when you can play triple support with Mantis.

5616
07:10:23,230 --> 07:10:24,770
It's just literally the better comp.

5617
07:10:35,500 --> 07:10:36,460
Like play Luna.

5618
07:10:36,640 --> 07:10:36,760
Yeah.

5619
07:10:37,260 --> 07:10:37,740
Like play...

5620
07:10:37,740 --> 07:10:39,320
If you were gonna throw at least play Luna.

5621
07:10:48,980 --> 07:10:49,500
Well.

5622
07:10:49,980 --> 07:10:50,200
Well.

5623
07:10:59,680 --> 07:11:00,860
Pick your hero.

5624
07:11:01,360 --> 07:11:01,900
Or villain.

5625
07:11:02,000 --> 07:11:04,300
i'm not judging all right

5626
07:11:09,170 --> 07:11:17,630
oh well i mean it works i would play jeff i mean i could

it i'll go get loki it's a very weird support god That's a

5628
07:11:36,590 --> 07:11:37,770
word I will say.

5629
07:11:41,930 --> 07:11:42,570
Um...

5630
07:11:42,570 --> 07:11:44,110
Is it today supposed to be...

5631
07:11:44,110 --> 07:11:45,910
It was until I...

5632
07:11:45,910 --> 07:11:48,590
Until I got the rival's bug.

5633
07:11:49,770 --> 07:11:53,970
The siren called for me and was like, What if you just keep
playing?

5634
07:11:54,130 --> 07:11:56,450
And I'm like, You're great.

5635
07:11:59,030 --> 07:12:01,970
They're like, Tomorrow's your rest day, Doki.

5636
07:12:02,570 --> 07:12:04,430
What if you just keep playing?

5637
07:12:04,910 --> 07:12:08,190
like you're right

5638
07:12:13,770 --> 07:12:15,910
I don't even enjoy the streams

5639
07:12:19,170 --> 07:12:22,730
well he's the only one opening up for it

5640
07:12:26,290 --> 07:12:32,510
which way which way is the enemy okay I got a little
confused I was like which way is the enemy though

5641
07:12:37,530 --> 07:12:38,770
Oh, there's something wrong.

5642
07:12:38,930 --> 07:12:40,650
I might just check my mouse settings now.

5643
07:12:50,410 --> 07:12:51,070
There's something.

5644
07:12:51,290 --> 07:12:53,090
Yeah, my mouse sense is high.

5645
07:12:54,250 --> 07:12:54,690
There's something.

5646
07:12:54,810 --> 07:12:55,770
I need to check the...

5647
07:12:57,110 --> 07:12:58,010
I unplugged it.

5648
07:12:58,470 --> 07:13:01,330
I unplugged it, but my mouse sense is very high right now.

5649
07:13:03,570 --> 07:13:07,170
I got a check-in mouse acceleration was accident.

5650
07:13:07,830 --> 07:13:08,630
What the...

5651
07:13:09,310 --> 07:13:11,230
Oh my god, if I do...

5652
07:13:11,970 --> 07:13:13,810
Oh, I could have...

5653
07:13:13,810 --> 07:13:14,810
Oh, I'm mad.

5654
07:13:15,230 --> 07:13:18,710
And it like actually jumped scared me.

5655
07:13:18,790 --> 07:13:20,090
I was like, what the fuck?

5656
07:13:20,290 --> 07:13:21,990
Is she just standing there?

5657
07:13:22,590 --> 07:13:24,650
I actually got jumped scared.

5658
07:13:27,050 --> 07:13:29,250
I got so confused.

5659
07:13:30,070 --> 07:13:31,210
When I saw it.

5660
07:13:31,230 --> 07:13:32,790
It looks like Namor called in his swim team.

5661
07:13:32,970 --> 07:13:34,030
You don't have to fight alone.

5662
07:13:34,270 --> 07:13:35,170
It felt nice.

5663
07:13:35,930 --> 07:13:37,070
Here's how you shoot.

5664
07:13:39,230 --> 07:13:39,750

5676
07:15:35,150 --> 07:15:37,970
I have the lowest I have the lowest heal output.

5677
07:15:38,210 --> 07:15:39,350
So is it really my bad?

5678
07:15:42,550 --> 07:15:47,330
My heal output is is theoretically be a lowest

5679
07:15:56,130 --> 07:16:00,370
There you go It's Shenzhen's over, Shenzhen's over.

5680
07:16:01,810 --> 07:16:02,670
There we go.

5681
07:16:05,190 --> 07:16:05,870
Alright, here we go.

5682
07:16:08,630 --> 07:16:09,290
No, I'm...

5683
07:16:10,410 --> 07:16:10,930
He's...

5684
07:16:12,130 --> 07:16:15,370
I assume Amadian 3...

5685
07:16:15,370 --> 07:16:16,870
That is his third account.

5686
07:16:17,170 --> 07:16:18,350
That's what I assume.

5687
07:16:22,350 --> 07:16:22,870
I...

5688
07:16:22,870 --> 07:16:24,170
No, it is weird.

5689
07:16:24,270 --> 07:16:26,050
Alright, I'm gonna check my mouse settings.

5690
07:16:26,470 --> 07:16:28,630
I... Something feels weird with my mouse.

5691
07:16:29,150 --> 07:16:52,250
it feels super high I'm gonna double check now where's mouse
mouse enhance pointer okay where is the additional mouse

5692
07:16:52,250 --> 07:16:59,950
thing stereo point what okay no everything seems fine.

5693
07:17:00,170 --> 07:17:00,930
This is my DPI.

5694
07:17:02,910 --> 07:17:05,490
Feels hot for some fucking reason.

5695
07:17:06,870 --> 07:17:07,350
Yeah, I saw.

5696
07:17:07,630 --> 07:17:08,410
I saw 800.

5697
07:17:09,810 --> 07:17:10,970
What the fuck?

5698
07:17:11,910 --> 07:17:12,210
Oh.

5699
07:17:12,830 --> 07:17:14,970
Maybe I played on the high sense too much.

5700
07:17:15,770 --> 07:17:19,230
And then my muscle memory was not great.

5701
07:17:19,330 --> 07:17:20,110
It was some shit.

5702
07:17:20,630 --> 07:17:23,110
My muscle memory was like, whoops!

5703
07:17:23,410 --> 07:17:25,710
You played on high sense for too long.

5704
07:17:26,150 --> 07:17:30,970
I'm like, oh my god, I didn't even I noticed they fucking
portaled again.

5705
07:17:32,730 --> 07:17:34,410
And they're like, it's two.

5706
07:17:35,050 --> 07:17:35,370
It's it.

5707
07:17:35,630 --> 07:17:36,070
That's it.

5708
07:17:47,060 --> 07:17:47,660
Like...

5709
07:17:48,800 --> 07:17:51,980
I do not want to play against our torch.

5710
07:17:56,040 --> 07:18:00,720
I'm pretty sure Amalian 3 is like this guy's through the
couch.

5711
07:18:00,800 --> 07:18:02,380
I'm pretty sure.

5712
07:18:04,380 --> 07:18:08,980
Like, I have a feeling that it's his fucking third account.

5713
07:18:12,940 --> 07:18:13,340
Yeah.

5714
07:18:14,760 --> 07:18:16,260
Like, I don't...

5715
07:18:16,260 --> 07:18:18,500
Oh, that would have hit him.

5716
07:18:20,320 --> 07:18:21,720
Am I?

5717
07:18:21,800 --> 07:18:22,100
Okay.

5718
07:18:22,380 --> 07:18:23,800
I was gonna say it.

5719
07:18:24,900 --> 07:18:26,940
I'm a little scared, though.

5720
07:18:26,940 --> 07:18:28,090
I'm gonna...

5721
07:18:30,540 --> 07:18:31,940
Well, let's hope that...

5722
07:18:36,600 --> 07:18:37,420
Oh my god.

5723
07:18:38,080 --> 07:18:39,180
Wait, we don't have a second up.

5724
07:18:39,640 --> 07:18:40,280
We don't...

5725
07:18:40,280 --> 07:18:41,900
There's so much damage!

5726
07:18:44,280 --> 07:18:45,640
Who are we gonna do?

5727
07:18:46,360 --> 07:18:48,280
I expect more damage!

5728
07:18:52,150 --> 07:18:53,650
I can't do anything about that.

5729
07:18:53,850 --> 07:18:54,630
Sorry, but...

5730
07:18:58,520 --> 07:18:59,060
There we go.

5731
07:18:59,300 --> 07:19:01,320
What the fuck was that lie?

5732
07:19:02,700 --> 07:19:06,240
That was a- that was some fucking wild projectile lag there.

5733
07:19:06,980 --> 07:19:08,340
I should not have hit that.

5734
07:19:10,000 --> 07:19:11,560
I'm like, I mean, I'm not complaining.

5735
07:19:15,380 --> 07:19:16,820
What is that up?

5736
07:19:17,660 --> 07:19:19,740
What the fuck was that up?

5737
07:19:23,460 --> 07:19:24,720
Alright, let's go.

5738
07:19:25,720 --> 07:19:30,500
Yeah, yeah, I'm like, you know what would have been helpful
if you fucking save that all for that?

5739
07:19:32,820 --> 07:19:35,380
I think if you saved it, it would have been fine.

5740
07:19:41,450 --> 07:19:45,030
It would have been nice if they peaked me so I can farm just
a little teensy bit.

5741
07:19:49,240 --> 07:19:49,880
Where are they going?

5742
07:19:50,320 --> 07:19:51,380
Oh no!

5743
07:19:52,100 --> 07:19:53,460
I back out now.

5744
07:19:54,580 --> 07:19:55,820
That's where they're going.

5745
07:20:01,380 --> 07:20:02,920
Okay, a big issue.

5746
07:20:05,100 --> 07:20:06,660
I never miss.

5747
07:20:07,540 --> 07:20:08,160
Okay, okay, okay.

5748
07:20:13,230 --> 07:20:14,430
Oh my god.

5749
07:20:16,110 --> 07:20:17,710
Wait, this guy's dumb.

5750
07:20:25,250 --> 07:20:25,970
Wait,

5751
07:20:30,410 --> 07:20:31,630
I'm just like, wait a minute.

5752
07:20:31,810 --> 07:20:33,490
This guy's making stupid.

5753
07:20:41,570 --> 07:20:43,010
Let's kill him.

5754
07:20:43,830 --> 07:20:44,830
Oh, my.

5755
07:20:45,510 --> 07:20:46,230
ROTPA?

5756
07:20:49,450 --> 07:20:51,610
Okay, I might have threw that with that up.

5757
07:20:52,370 --> 07:20:54,070
I just thought he was fucking stupid.

5758
07:21:07,190 --> 07:21:07,670
Okay.

5759
07:21:08,450 --> 07:21:09,550
Oh, my God.

5760
07:21:10,430 --> 07:21:11,430
Wait, I think this is it.

5761
07:21:11,470 --> 07:21:13,290
I think it's the DJ Qs.

5762
07:21:18,910 --> 07:21:20,310
Nice up, nerd.

5763
07:21:20,690 --> 07:21:22,550
I was like, wait a minute.

5764
07:21:23,410 --> 07:21:25,030
That's fucking stupid.

5765
07:21:25,210 --> 07:21:30,990
And it's like, yeah, dumb as hell, but run at him.

5766
07:21:32,910 --> 07:21:33,670
I made it.

5767
07:21:33,710 --> 07:21:35,510
I made it to the promised land.

5768
07:21:35,870 --> 07:21:38,370
We finally reached the D-Gen hours.

5769
07:21:38,790 --> 07:21:42,510
The peak, the peak rivals games.

5770
07:21:47,010 --> 07:21:49,730
We fucking did it, guys.

5771
07:21:50,350 --> 07:21:51,470
Holy shit.

5772
07:21:52,270 --> 07:21:53,330
We fucking did it.

5773
07:21:56,950 --> 07:21:57,990
Oh, GG's.

5774
07:21:58,410 --> 07:21:59,650
I didn't see your main before.

5775
07:21:59,990 --> 07:22:01,410
I was like, I knew for sure.

5776
07:22:02,210 --> 07:22:07,690
like, this is what we, GG's butt, man.

5777
07:22:08,350 --> 07:22:11,310
I was like, man, I know that's not your main.

5778
07:22:11,890 --> 07:22:12,230
I,

5779
07:22:22,580 --> 07:22:25,080
is this what you call the promised land?

5780
07:22:25,900 --> 07:22:30,580
I told you, the moment you head to DJ and Q's, the game's
improved, guys.

5781
07:22:31,760 --> 07:22:32,820
is my land.

5782
07:22:33,200 --> 07:22:34,360
That is my queues.

5783
07:22:34,460 --> 07:22:35,780
Those are my queues.

5784
07:22:36,720 --> 07:22:38,540
That's where I thrive.

5785
07:22:40,360 --> 07:22:42,240
It's literally how I thrive.

5786
07:22:45,000 --> 07:22:45,640
Somehow.

5787
07:22:46,740 --> 07:22:47,660
It's my home.

5788
07:22:48,980 --> 07:22:50,400
I feel so comfy.

5789
07:22:52,640 --> 07:22:53,920
It's my people.

5790
07:22:56,580 --> 07:22:57,080
I don't know.

5791
07:22:57,580 --> 07:22:57,840
Yeah.

5792
07:22:59,380 --> 07:23:00,160
I don't know.

5793
07:23:00,220 --> 07:23:01,740
He's still here, but I don't know.

5794
07:23:01,760 --> 07:23:06,420
No, I did weekend queues for the first time and went from
Celestio 2 to GM 1.

5795
07:23:10,100 --> 07:23:12,500
I was like, can't be that bad.

5796
07:23:13,320 --> 07:23:17,120
And then this is now PSA to never queue at this hour.

5797
07:23:17,560 --> 07:23:21,700
Like, on this day and Saturday, we never queue on these two
days.

5798
07:23:21,980 --> 07:23:27,420
This will be the last time I ever play on Saturday or Sunday
for rivals.

5799
07:23:27,800 --> 07:23:29,800
It'll be the very last time.

5800
07:23:34,230 --> 07:23:36,590
It isn't, no, it's crazy.

5801
07:23:36,790 --> 07:23:38,750
It is actually insane.

5802
07:23:39,430 --> 07:23:44,550
I've been streaming and playing this game since the
beginning of the season, like on and off.

5803
07:23:45,270 --> 07:23:56,270
But none of us, I don't think any of us has ever encountered
lobbies that were this special.

5804
07:24:00,770 --> 07:24:02,050
I don't...

5805
07:24:03,610 --> 07:24:08,230
I do not think we've ever encountered lobbies like this
before.

5806
07:24:12,290 --> 07:24:14,830
That was, guys, third game!

5807
07:24:15,190 --> 07:24:16,030
We made it!

5808
07:24:17,950 --> 07:24:18,830
Third game?

5809
07:24:19,770 --> 07:24:21,330
Guys, third game!

5810
07:24:21,790 --> 07:24:24,910
That someone wasn't toxic or blamed somebody.

5811
07:24:25,510 --> 07:24:26,690
We fucking made it!

5812
07:24:26,970 --> 07:24:29,150
We've hit game number three!

5813
07:24:39,960 --> 07:24:40,360
Yeah!

5814
07:24:42,980 --> 07:24:44,640
Put it up on the board.

5815
07:24:46,680 --> 07:24:47,580
Take a picture, guys.

5816
07:24:47,700 --> 07:24:48,980
We got to take a picture.

5817
07:24:49,160 --> 07:24:50,100
We made it.

5818
07:24:50,440 --> 07:24:52,860
Three games where no one blamed anybody.

5819
07:24:53,560 --> 07:24:56,480
And like, everyone was, like, nobody said anything.

5820
07:24:56,740 --> 07:24:58,220
Which is already a plus.

5821
07:24:58,680 --> 07:24:58,960
You know?

5822
07:24:59,280 --> 07:25:01,240
We were doing, like, the bare minimum.

5823
07:25:02,880 --> 07:25:11,140
Guys, this is, like, the bare minimum of people not even
saying anything.

5824
07:25:14,480 --> 07:25:25,640
wait no there was one word yeah you know from just sunday
cues from just sunday cues i literally had we've only had

5825
07:25:25,640 --> 07:25:35,960
four games where someone did not throw did not blame someone
did not yell each other and just played the game and was

5826
07:25:35,960 --> 07:25:46,020
either just play the game or was positive about the game and
I've been streaming for seven hours and all those other

5827
07:25:46,020 --> 07:26:04,080
games people were not happy like there will be arguments the
fact that it's easier to count the games that were not bad

5828
07:26:04,080 --> 07:26:12,540
no it's it's the weekend views bro I tell you it's the
fucking weekend queues.

5829
07:26:16,020 --> 07:26:17,490
It's where like...

5830
07:26:18,360 --> 07:26:21,140
It's where everybody comes on.

5831
07:26:31,430 --> 07:26:35,690
When you're desperate for people to not even say anything.

5832
07:26:36,370 --> 07:26:39,690
I am surprised we went Luna, but you know what?

5833
07:26:41,630 --> 07:26:43,170
I won't judge.

5834
07:26:43,850 --> 07:26:47,210
All right, we're not gonna okay, cool.

5835
07:26:47,650 --> 07:27:00,290
I didn't want to use that but like I also don't didn't think
like my Luna would live Hey It's my art did our venom just

5836
07:27:00,290 --> 07:27:03,110
try to dive an iron fist?

5837
07:27:04,430 --> 07:27:07,890
Whoa Maybe the wrong target?

5838
07:27:08,830 --> 07:27:18,050
I don't know that's just my opinion I was like, you can dive
anyone in the world.

5839
07:27:18,290 --> 07:27:19,730
Who will you pick?

5840
07:27:21,930 --> 07:27:24,990
Uh, that was bad reaction time for me.

5841
07:27:26,430 --> 07:27:27,850
I legitimately thought they were closer.

5842
07:27:30,630 --> 07:27:33,670
Because both our DPS was not there.

5843
07:27:37,210 --> 07:27:38,190
Yeah, see you dropped?

5844
07:27:38,390 --> 07:27:39,010
Exactly!

5845
07:27:41,810 --> 07:27:42,410
Exactly.

5846
07:27:42,430 --> 07:27:43,490
You see the way now.

5847
07:27:43,850 --> 07:27:52,230
what you see the way this is like a psa i mean she has all
first so

5848
07:27:58,100 --> 07:28:06,480
oh i mean that's cool oh that is not no longer cool where's
my all right here

5849
07:28:10,660 --> 07:28:24,220
okay okay let's okay guys guys i don't know why we were all
we're all split up there but we got oh all right i don't

5850
07:28:24,220 --> 07:28:32,720
know they have a mag do they have a mag i was gonna say this
might be a cloak angle but they do have a mag

5851
07:28:35,980 --> 07:28:43,380
oh wait i didn't even realize i have a moon night looking i
was not paying attention oh okay oh my god i didn't have a

5852
07:28:43,380 --> 07:28:48,440
phoenix okay i guess i just don't play nothing I don't have
to taint the mag.

5853
07:28:49,480 --> 07:28:51,300
Alright, the mag has to pick me or Punisher.

5854
07:28:51,900 --> 07:28:52,340
It's okay.

5855
07:28:52,840 --> 07:28:54,660
He has to pick one or the other.

5856
07:28:57,020 --> 07:28:58,020
It's alright.

5857
07:29:03,140 --> 07:29:04,560
That I'm also fine.

5858
07:29:04,700 --> 07:29:05,000
Oh!

5859
07:29:05,600 --> 07:29:06,520
He picked the Punisher.

5860
07:29:07,040 --> 07:29:07,920
He picked the Punisher.

5861
07:29:08,440 --> 07:29:09,160
He picked the Punisher.

5862
07:29:10,220 --> 07:29:11,560
He really did.

5863
07:29:14,140 --> 07:29:15,460
I did save.

5864
07:29:18,580 --> 07:29:19,640
oh my god

5865
07:29:31,940 --> 07:29:40,920
oh my god i'm trying to heal buddy like we have to kill this
guy i don't know i think it'd be easier if we just kill this

5866
07:29:40,920 --> 07:29:55,960
guy what did it i'm trying but like i'm fucking firm on the
crit bear i am ready to put on a show Alright, what?

5867
07:29:56,160 --> 07:29:56,960
Oh, wait, never mind.

5868
07:29:57,300 --> 07:29:59,320
I wanted to...

5869
07:29:59,320 --> 07:30:01,920
I'm just not gonna fucking believe it.

5870
07:30:08,520 --> 07:30:09,700
Alright, here we go.

5871
07:30:10,180 --> 07:30:11,720
That was such a huge risk.

5872
07:30:12,420 --> 07:30:13,760
When I did that.

5873
07:30:15,520 --> 07:30:16,920
That was like, I think.

5874
07:30:23,220 --> 07:30:25,000
Oh my god, you didn't realize.

5875
07:30:27,800 --> 07:30:28,760
Oh my god.

5876
07:30:29,160 --> 07:30:30,060
I'm trying, buddy.

5877
07:30:30,200 --> 07:30:31,260
I'm trying to heal.

5878
07:30:31,600 --> 07:30:33,700
How do we not shoot the Loki?

5879
07:30:36,940 --> 07:30:39,500
Oh, how is he still there?

5880
07:30:39,940 --> 07:30:42,780
I can't do anything.

5881
07:30:43,040 --> 07:30:44,700
I'm just a fucking baby.

5882
07:30:44,960 --> 07:30:45,480
I'm a joke.

5883
07:30:48,000 --> 07:30:50,420
I'm gonna steal that spot next time.

5884
07:30:51,400 --> 07:30:52,140
I can't play Loki.

5885
07:30:52,320 --> 07:30:53,220
They're playing Moon Knight.

5886
07:30:56,960 --> 07:31:02,780
You know what's crazy Are you just like not shooting the
Loki height?

5887
07:31:03,200 --> 07:31:04,440
Don't talk bro.

5888
07:31:04,560 --> 07:31:05,300
Don't fucking talk.

5889
07:31:05,540 --> 07:31:05,660
No, no, no, no.

5890
07:31:05,860 --> 07:31:08,040
I can't go back.

5891
07:31:08,520 --> 07:31:09,520
I can't go back.

5892
07:31:10,300 --> 07:31:11,320
I can't go back.

5893
07:31:11,540 --> 07:31:13,520
Guys, reset the boy.

5894
07:31:15,240 --> 07:31:16,520
Reset the timer.

5895
07:31:17,240 --> 07:31:20,340
Yeah, let me, let me play it on Punisher, bro.

5896
07:31:20,920 --> 07:31:21,840
Reset the calendar.

5897
07:31:24,040 --> 07:31:24,860
Like, what are you doing?

5898
07:31:25,040 --> 07:31:26,940
You're just sitting back with your dicky.

5899
07:31:28,460 --> 07:31:33,080
Because the crazy part is that our record is one game in a
row where people are...

5900
07:31:33,080 --> 07:31:34,960
I haven't seen you bait out rooms once.

5901
07:31:41,220 --> 07:31:46,060
I think this is a...

5902
07:31:46,060 --> 07:31:48,180
I think this is making rivals look bad.

5903
07:31:48,280 --> 07:31:49,380
It might...

5904
07:31:49,380 --> 07:31:52,300
I'm sorry, rival this, but like...

5905
07:31:52,300 --> 07:31:56,620
It's not my fault that the community is a little bit trashy.

5906
07:31:56,960 --> 07:31:58,820
What is that?

5907
07:31:59,240 --> 07:32:00,420
This might be a negative.

5908
07:32:00,840 --> 07:32:02,380
This might look bad.

5909
07:32:09,700 --> 07:32:12,020
It's definitely God.

5910
07:32:12,900 --> 07:32:20,040
Guys, I think I'm accidentally making rivals look really
bad, right?

5911
07:32:21,080 --> 07:32:23,500
Or did it me too?

5912
07:32:36,880 --> 07:32:38,780
Wait, who's my other...

5913
07:32:38,780 --> 07:32:39,100
Oh.

5914
07:32:41,840 --> 07:32:43,840
You started out in the game O3, bro.

5915
07:32:44,620 --> 07:32:45,540
Let's not forget that.

5916
07:32:45,580 --> 07:32:46,760
I did not forget that, brother.

5917
07:32:49,140 --> 07:32:51,340
I was like, wait, was my other...

5918
07:32:51,340 --> 07:32:51,880
Oh.

5919
07:32:52,820 --> 07:32:53,320
No.

5920
07:32:55,560 --> 07:32:57,760
There's no other support.

5921
07:32:58,540 --> 07:33:00,280
It's just me.

5922
07:33:01,560 --> 07:33:02,720
It really is.

5923
07:33:02,780 --> 07:33:03,800
It's just me.

5924
07:33:05,640 --> 07:33:07,460
Oh boy!

5925
07:33:08,140 --> 07:33:09,800

5927
07:33:22,520 --> 07:33:27,720
I was confused a little bit.

5928
07:33:29,100 --> 07:33:30,360

The Loki was the one that DC'd.

5966
07:37:34,050 --> 07:37:37,050
The raid boss test is dead.

5967
07:37:41,050 --> 07:37:43,710
The raid boss fucking...

5968
07:37:44,290 --> 07:37:46,490
They took the raid boss down.

5969
07:37:46,610 --> 07:37:47,410
Don't worry.

5970
07:37:48,490 --> 07:37:49,990
The raid boss down.

5971
07:37:50,130 --> 07:37:50,870
Let's go.

5972
07:37:51,650 --> 07:37:54,510
Yeah, the one that held their team together.

5973
07:37:55,710 --> 07:37:56,650

Thank you.

There's hope.

5977
07:37:59,130 --> 07:37:59,450
Guys.

5978
07:37:59,950 --> 07:38:00,770
See, there's hope.

5979
07:38:01,450 --> 07:38:02,350
I told you.

5980
07:38:02,730 --> 07:38:04,910
The D-Gen Qs are my town.

5981
07:38:05,090 --> 07:38:06,570
They're my territory.

5982
07:38:08,010 --> 07:38:08,850
Yeah, focus.

5983
07:38:08,970 --> 07:38:10,530
I took that Loki out.

5984
07:38:10,630 --> 07:38:11,190
IRL.

5985
07:38:11,910 --> 07:38:13,730
That's like, give me back my Elo.

5986
07:38:15,530 --> 07:38:18,310
You don't need it as much as me right now.

5987
07:38:19,010 --> 07:38:20,490
Actually, I don't need it either.

5988
07:38:20,650 --> 07:38:21,890
I'm just taking it for fun.

5989
07:38:23,350 --> 07:38:25,110
I also don't need it.

5990
07:38:36,400 --> 07:38:37,660
This is it.

5991
07:38:41,180 --> 07:38:41,760
Taking Elo.

Vibes are gone.

5998
07:39:09,560 --> 07:39:09,980
Words go.

5999
07:39:10,020 --> 07:39:12,060
Well, my vibes aren't gone, but the words.

6000
07:39:12,980 --> 07:39:14,300
Can't say vibe no more.

6001
07:39:14,500 --> 07:39:19,060

6005
07:39:54,350 --> 07:39:57,070
It was one of my favorite words.

6006
07:39:57,110 --> 07:39:57,730
We abandoned this.

6007
07:40:00,590 --> 07:40:01,810
Now it's gone.

6008
07:40:03,190 --> 07:40:04,130

07:40:11,390 --> 07:40:13,490
Never mind, I don't care no more.

6011
07:40:14,630 --> 07:40:16,130
Are you fighting?

6012
07:40:19,190 --> 07:40:19,910
No.

6013
07:40:27,910 --> 07:40:28,630
Alright.

6014
07:40:39,850 --> 07:40:41,230
What fucking can I play?

6015
07:40:42,050 --> 07:40:43,850
Oh, Phoenix is bad.

6016
07:40:44,210 --> 07:40:46,570
Well, Phoenix is bad, so I might as well.

6017
07:40:46,950 --> 07:40:47,350
You know?

6018
07:40:48,370 --> 07:40:49,290
Makes sense.

6019
07:40:51,050 --> 07:40:59,690
Okay, I'll I go actually cloak only because that Cloak is
just so strong.

6020
07:41:00,210 --> 07:41:00,270

6021
07:41:00,790 --> 07:41:02,490

6022
07:41:02,830 --> 07:41:03,370

last week, which is like two whole streets.

07:46:30,550 --> 07:46:31,650
Don't get angry.

6121
07:46:31,930 --> 07:46:33,230
It is what it is.

6122
07:46:37,250 --> 07:46:37,830
Oh my god.

6123
07:46:37,990 --> 07:46:38,650
Wait, what?

6124
07:46:38,830 --> 07:46:39,630
Where's my tank?

6125
07:46:44,300 --> 07:46:45,180
Oh, shit.

6126
07:46:45,260 --> 07:46:46,200
Is my tank gonna be okay?

6127
07:46:46,300 --> 07:46:46,880
She got well done.

6128
07:46:51,960 --> 07:46:52,840
Oh, no.

6129
07:46:53,460 --> 07:46:54,640
Don't get angry, guys.

6130
07:46:54,740 --> 07:46:55,640
It's still winnable.

6131
07:46:56,020 --> 07:46:56,620
It's still winnable.

6132
07:46:56,920 --> 07:46:59,020
Don't get, he has been walling people off.

6133
07:46:59,180 --> 07:46:59,860
I will sit.

6134
07:47:01,080 --> 07:47:05,100
I think we can combine Mantis and I'm an altman.

6135
07:47:08,640 --> 07:47:09,880
I am Groot.

6136
07:47:10,060 --> 07:47:10,660
Like so hard.

6137
07:47:11,720 --> 07:47:12,520
I am Groot.

6138
07:47:12,920 --> 07:47:14,220
Do you want to alt Mantis?

6139
07:47:18,420 --> 07:47:19,660
Where is he?

6140
07:47:21,700 --> 07:47:22,660
Oh my god.

6141
07:47:23,280 --> 07:47:25,180
I was like, where is he?

6142
07:47:29,760 --> 07:47:31,340
I was so...

6143
07:47:31,340 --> 07:47:32,000
I got...

6144
07:47:32,000 --> 07:47:34,940
Oh, we did not need that for shit.

6145
07:47:54,620 --> 07:47:55,420
Oh my...

6146
07:47:55,420 --> 07:47:56,480
Oh my...

6147
07:47:58,000 --> 07:48:01,060
We could have used that on the last fight!

6148
07:48:02,760 --> 07:48:04,040
Wait, so what did we get in Bizzou?

6149
07:48:05,580 --> 07:48:06,360
Oh, not me!

6150
07:48:06,760 --> 07:48:07,260
Not me!

6151
07:48:07,360 --> 07:48:08,520
Right side, we have Coco.

6152
07:48:08,900 --> 07:48:09,820
Come on, right side, we have Coco.

6153
07:48:10,220 --> 07:48:10,940
Not me!

6154
07:48:10,940 --> 07:48:14,940
Can we get it?

6155
07:48:17,960 --> 07:48:20,160
They have a storm bolt coming off and he's gonna die.

6156
07:48:26,270 --> 07:48:26,730
Whoa!

6157
07:48:27,330 --> 07:48:27,570
Here.

6158
07:48:29,250 --> 07:48:30,550
I might be dead, though.

6159
07:48:32,010 --> 07:48:33,750
I might be dead, though.

6160
07:48:35,430 --> 07:48:35,830
Yeah.

6161
07:48:37,210 --> 07:48:38,650
Hey, I'm Ace!

6162
07:48:40,430 --> 07:48:41,410

6163
07:48:42,690 --> 07:48:43,450
Oh!

6164
07:48:44,710 --> 07:48:45,230
Yeah!

6165
07:48:52,110 --> 07:48:53,250
Okay, I'm coming off.

6166
07:48:53,430 --> 07:48:54,690
I'm very slowly coming.

6167
07:48:55,090 --> 07:48:56,650
Oh, this is...

6168
07:48:56,650 --> 07:48:58,150
Oh, that's it.

6169
07:48:58,250 --> 07:48:58,450
Oh!

6170
07:49:01,290 --> 07:49:03,470
Oh, my ace got taken, duh.

6171
07:49:04,090 --> 07:49:04,830
Not my fuss.

6172
07:49:05,130 --> 07:49:09,050
In the end, I was not playing for anything.

6173
07:49:10,190 --> 07:49:10,870
It's...

6174
07:49:10,870 --> 07:49:11,910
It's...

6175
07:49:11,910 --> 07:49:14,570
We gotta reset, reset the clock.

6176
07:49:14,990 --> 07:49:16,770
We gotta reset it.

6177
07:49:17,230 --> 07:49:26,590
set the timer we have we have to reset it again

6178
07:49:41,560 --> 07:49:45,680
it helps me see the darkness and face it

6179
07:49:52,610 --> 07:49:57,990
not me not me was it me

6180
07:50:01,250 --> 07:50:08,070
i didn't do nothing It's alright, they give it to your one
son, they give thank you.

6181
07:50:13,060 --> 07:50:14,640
I was in the problem!

6182
07:50:16,200 --> 07:50:22,940
The battle starts in five, four, three, three, three.

6183
07:50:33,220 --> 07:50:40,320
Oh, I used that because I was gonna do a sick ass let fade
from the grab and then it's gonna grab my teammates instead.

6184
07:50:41,040 --> 07:50:41,920
I imagine.

6185
07:50:46,820 --> 07:50:49,240
See look at that sick ass.

6186
07:50:49,660 --> 07:50:54,240
I didn't fade it though, but Almost where it

6187
07:50:59,240 --> 07:51:00,320
Don't worry.

6188
07:51:01,620 --> 07:51:04,060
Oh man, maybe worry a little bit.

6189
07:51:04,540 --> 07:51:04,600
Don't worry.

6190
07:51:04,700 --> 07:51:05,180
I got you

6191
07:51:10,660 --> 07:51:17,100
All right I don't know if I should talk All

6192
07:51:25,380 --> 07:51:49,340
right here oh god oh my god I'm fucking so good at this
video game are you next to me next in this in this in this

6193
07:51:49,340 --> 07:51:55,520
in this in this in this oh we

6194
07:52:01,780 --> 07:52:07,280
save them save his life save his life

6195
07:52:15,780 --> 07:52:17,000
Save his life!

6196
07:52:17,720 --> 07:52:20,940
Oh my god, save my life, save my life, save my life.

6197
07:52:22,020 --> 07:52:25,040
It's okay, you don't need to save my life, my life no
matter.

6198
07:52:26,140 --> 07:52:27,660
My life don't matter.

6199
07:52:29,600 --> 07:52:31,980
I wasn't sure we get the lights out.

6200
07:52:32,860 --> 07:52:35,860
Oh my god, we're missing the triple support and triple.

6201
07:52:36,700 --> 07:52:38,380
Look at this walkback!

6202
07:52:38,920 --> 07:52:41,420
This walkback is crazy!

6203
07:52:46,540 --> 07:52:50,720
I want to say this is a fucking insane walkback in general.

6204
07:52:53,060 --> 07:52:55,340
I don't fucking believe in this walkback.

6205
07:52:58,420 --> 07:53:04,360
I swear to God, this walkback is insane compared to, like,
the other maps.

6206
07:53:04,740 --> 07:53:06,220
This feels longer, right?

6207
07:53:06,300 --> 07:53:08,520
Guys, I peg men 6-7 go first.

6208
07:53:09,660 --> 07:53:12,740
This, this feels, it feels longer, right?

6209
07:53:12,880 --> 07:53:17,820
I'm not fucking like dreaming right at how long this felt.

6210
07:53:19,660 --> 07:53:21,440
Okay, this is bad.

6211
07:53:30,980 --> 07:53:35,640
Like I'm not fucking dreaming right with how long this walk
back is.

6212
07:53:37,820 --> 07:53:40,340
Look, we are stalling like our fucking hearts out.

6213
07:53:46,120 --> 07:53:47,740
All right, we go ahead and make it through.

6214
07:53:49,980 --> 07:53:50,460
Yeah.

6215
07:53:54,550 --> 07:53:57,070
Definitely longer than any of the other maps.

6216
07:53:58,350 --> 07:54:01,350
I feel- the moment we walked back, the car was already
halfway.

6217
07:54:01,830 --> 07:54:03,630
Like almost- it was already at the point.

6218
07:54:08,250 --> 07:54:09,690
No, I hate this map.

6219
07:54:09,950 --> 07:54:13,770
Like, I swear- I swear to God this shit is like-

6220
07:54:17,860 --> 07:54:18,760
Alright, nice.

6221
07:54:19,460 --> 07:54:20,080
That's cool.

6222
07:54:20,920 --> 07:54:22,300
Oh wait, that's not what I wanted to do.

6223
07:54:27,620 --> 07:54:28,280
all

6224
07:54:32,720 --> 07:54:46,560
right we gotta go over now we oh we gotta go over now oh my
god they went back to triplet it's the fight of the triplets

6225
07:54:46,560 --> 07:54:48,790
apart who will win

6226
07:54:52,450 --> 07:54:56,140
they're going for group combos now group me

6227
07:54:59,420 --> 07:55:00,680
You can go first, Invis.

6228
07:55:07,930 --> 07:55:08,570
Oh my!

6229
07:55:08,930 --> 07:55:13,850
I said Invis first, so if she doesn't do it, that's on her.

6230
07:55:14,130 --> 07:55:14,570
Manta...

6231
07:55:14,570 --> 07:55:17,590
He's looking for it, he's looking for it, he's looking for
it here.

6232
07:55:22,030 --> 07:55:22,470
Oh,

6233
07:55:25,690 --> 07:55:26,410
I fucked it up.

6234
07:55:27,310 --> 07:55:27,850
Just fight.

6235
07:55:30,510 --> 07:55:31,170
I'm doing it.

6236
07:55:31,910 --> 07:55:33,210
I fucking knew it too.

6237
07:55:34,270 --> 07:55:36,370
Oh my god, I fucking knew it.

6238
07:55:37,370 --> 07:55:38,590
I knew it was gonna happen.

6239
07:55:41,590 --> 07:55:42,390
That's right!

6240
07:55:42,510 --> 07:55:43,930
That's got game sense, bitch!

6241
07:55:44,690 --> 07:55:45,970
That's got game sense!

6242
07:55:46,710 --> 07:55:47,810
Oh my god, I'll save you.

6243
07:55:48,030 --> 07:55:49,110
I'll save you, my queen.

6244
07:55:49,690 --> 07:55:51,570
Okay, but like, I swear to God.

6245
07:55:51,810 --> 07:55:52,990
Okay, that's...

6246
07:55:52,990 --> 07:55:54,830
That's on you for...

6247
07:55:57,090 --> 07:55:57,610
That's...

6248
07:55:58,330 --> 07:56:00,230
Okay, she was stupid.

6249
07:56:00,350 --> 07:56:02,190
I don't know why she...

6250
07:56:02,190 --> 07:56:03,110
Not my fault.

6251
07:56:03,210 --> 07:56:03,670
Actually, no.

6252
07:56:03,690 --> 07:56:04,410
not my fault.

6253
07:56:05,030 --> 07:56:10,270
Actually, she was 1 HP and she fully committed that.

6254
07:56:12,170 --> 07:56:15,150
That is not my fault at all.

6255
07:56:25,120 --> 07:56:28,800
I'm trying to try my best.

6256
07:56:29,120 --> 07:56:29,120
I'm trying my best.

6257
07:56:30,520 --> 07:56:31,200
I'm so dead.

6258
07:56:32,080 --> 07:56:33,880
I died for him.

6259
07:56:37,480 --> 07:56:39,600
I died for this guy.

6260
07:56:41,020 --> 07:56:42,900
I died for him.

6261
07:56:44,120 --> 07:56:45,660
I died for this man.

6262
07:56:48,380 --> 07:56:50,920
I had like really good positioning.

6263
07:56:52,580 --> 07:56:53,480
I'll let him build up.

6264
07:56:58,270 --> 07:56:58,450
Whoa.

6265
07:57:03,020 --> 07:57:04,460
Oh man.

6266
07:57:07,360 --> 07:57:07,720
Um...

6267
07:57:08,080 --> 07:57:09,160
You know what I was saying?

6268
07:57:09,320 --> 07:57:10,020
Quarter attempt.

6269
07:57:13,420 --> 07:57:26,820
I think if I didn't die for our, if I didn't die for our
Invis, or like for our Hella, we could have won that.

6270
07:57:36,480 --> 07:57:39,000
Never save your DPS.

6271
07:57:39,920 --> 07:57:40,420
Yeah.

6272
07:57:42,500 --> 07:57:43,120
Yeah.

6273
07:57:48,410 --> 07:57:49,210
Yeah.

6274
07:57:50,710 --> 07:57:52,230
Why do I sound scared?

6275
07:57:52,470 --> 07:57:56,330
It's because I want people to pity me.

6276
07:57:58,630 --> 07:58:05,470
Surprisingly, people don't want to yell at someone that
sounds sad on mic.

6277
07:58:06,810 --> 07:58:08,270
Not, no, let me be more specific.

6278
07:58:08,730 --> 07:58:14,070
People don't want to yell at a girl that sounds sad on the
mic, which I've noticed.

6279
07:58:14,490 --> 07:58:18,910
So I'm trying to farm the empathy so that they don't yell at
me.

6280
07:58:20,950 --> 07:58:23,590
for for now

6281
07:58:28,410 --> 07:58:48,230
and i'm sad maxing and my god she's a genius so how are you
real so if i when i do call us if if i sound sadder and or

6282
07:58:48,230 --> 07:59:01,730
like more if i if i sound sad and not confident they will
they would pity they would pity me more and then i won't get

6283
07:59:01,730 --> 07:59:02,430
yelled at

6284
07:59:13,000 --> 07:59:20,960
well i had to coordinate all stuff because i'm um i double
ulted with my mantis last time

6285
07:59:37,240 --> 07:59:39,790
But it's okay.

6286
07:59:42,800 --> 07:59:53,820
Surprisingly, I will say, surprisingly though, people have
got, even though this game, people were a little toxic.

6287
07:59:54,740 --> 08:00:00,180
Surprisingly, people got a bit nicer.

6288
08:00:03,960 --> 08:00:04,980
Got a bit nicer.

6289
08:00:08,110 --> 08:00:16,060
So, my theory was technically correct regarding the Gen Qs.

6290
08:00:20,110 --> 08:00:21,030
No, it doesn't.

6291
08:00:21,290 --> 08:00:25,190
People, they got, they were being a little toxic there.

6292
08:00:35,460 --> 08:00:48,980
yeah everyone is fine oh god whoa my gosh that my voice
there oh my god my voice got up there but surprisingly all

6293
08:00:48,980 --> 08:00:57,880
the students and the little ones have finally went to bed so
now the cues are just are more stabilized yeah i know i'm

6294
08:00:57,880 --> 08:01:00,500
sorry my voice changer malfunctioned and it's fine.

6295
08:01:00,740 --> 08:01:01,980
It's back on.

6296
08:01:04,100 --> 08:01:04,540
Sorry.

6297
08:01:05,000 --> 08:01:05,320
Sorry.

6298
08:01:05,600 --> 08:01:08,060
That was just my voice changer fucked up a little.

6299
08:01:09,320 --> 08:01:09,900
But it's okay.

6300
08:01:10,020 --> 08:01:11,040
It's back on now.

6301
08:01:12,260 --> 08:01:13,460
That was just like, you know, static.

6302
08:01:13,580 --> 08:01:15,320
You know when the machine stops working?

6303
08:01:16,700 --> 08:01:18,200
No, it's not the real voice.

6304
08:01:18,400 --> 08:01:20,280
It's like, you know when the machine...

6305
08:01:20,280 --> 08:01:21,320
What the... Okay.

6306
08:01:21,760 --> 08:01:23,600
You know when the machine stops working?

6307
08:01:23,680 --> 08:01:26,400
I mean, I could play Loki if you want to play, too.

6308
08:01:26,820 --> 08:01:27,480
Like, play.

6309
08:01:29,280 --> 08:01:31,200
Oh, okay, never mind, I guess not.

6310
08:01:31,700 --> 08:01:32,560
Okay, um...

6311
08:01:35,340 --> 08:01:38,720
Yeah, that's like when...

6312
08:01:38,720 --> 08:01:46,420
When the machine starts malfunctioning and it goes like the
static crunch, yeah, that's it.

6313
08:01:47,960 --> 08:01:49,540
The static crunch thing.

6314
08:01:57,840 --> 08:01:59,940
30 seconds before you attack.

6315
08:02:00,280 --> 08:02:00,780
Get ready.

6316
08:02:06,800 --> 08:02:07,140
Alright.

6317
08:02:07,360 --> 08:02:07,980

Okay, that was it.

be fine, right?

6334
08:04:40,860 --> 08:04:42,380
Too many of us.

6335

Too many of us.

6336
08:04:45,560 --> 08:04:50,200
Too many of us to fucking do defensively.

6337
08:04:51,860 --> 08:04:55,380
Like, I don't know what there's not enough.

6338
08:04:55,560 --> 08:05:01,080
Not enough for us for the amount of dps us we're going
through this neutral fight sucks

6339
08:05:04,490 --> 08:05:13,090
oh he's dead i say guys technically it's a win because
nobody is flaming

6340
08:05:16,410 --> 08:05:28,290
technically we haven't had anyone flame each other yet Our
only DPS is O3.

6341
08:05:32,230 --> 08:05:37,490
Our only DPS is O3 right now.

6342
08:05:39,210 --> 08:05:40,190
Don't worry, I got you.

6343
08:05:40,530 --> 08:05:41,690
Don't worry, I believe in you.

6344
08:05:41,890 --> 08:05:42,950
You can do this.

6345
08:05:43,550 --> 08:05:45,730
I believe in you.

6346
08:05:46,270 --> 08:05:47,630

08:05:57,490 --> 08:05:59,490
Oh my god, did you like that pull?

6349
08:06:00,330 --> 08:06:02,290
That pull, and we didn't kill him.

6350
08:06:02,510 --> 08:06:04,750
Oh my god, that was a sexy pull.

6351
08:06:05,410 --> 08:06:08,010
That was a sexy ass pull.

6352
08:06:08,470 --> 08:06:10,510
And we did nothing.

6353
08:06:11,430 --> 08:06:13,590
By the eye of Agumoto.

6354
08:06:14,310 --> 08:06:14,910
Disappear.

6355
08:06:15,250 --> 08:06:16,450
Wait, are you...

6356
08:06:16,450 --> 08:06:19,910
Okay, I was gonna say, I thought we agreed.

6357
08:06:21,390 --> 08:06:22,590
I thought we agreed.

6358
08:06:22,590 --> 08:06:26,630
This is real firepower.

6359
08:06:30,640 --> 08:06:40,300
there we go I'm not fucking wasting this all they have like
20 more ults I have to worry about right now like I'm not

have to give a fuck about

6361
08:06:50,810 --> 08:06:58,390
all right I need to have our supports build up I don't see
Jeff and Mantis as a double support out only because like

6362
08:06:58,390 --> 08:07:11,610
Jepholt is so weak supporting wise I don't find Jepholt very
supportive in general I have to use this this is best prayer

6363
08:07:11,610 --> 08:07:21,750
when you're in the invis when when they mock uh mox you all

6368
08:07:59,380 --> 08:08:01,120
okay that was scary

6369
08:08:23,800 --> 08:08:27,660
Oh my god, Jeff is a controller player.

6370
08:08:39,970 --> 08:08:42,850
Oh, they don't know which one is me.

6371
08:08:50,300 --> 08:08:52,440
Haha, they don't know which way I rotate it now.

6372
08:08:59,370 --> 08:09:00,130
Oh, yeah.

6373
08:09:01,130 --> 08:09:02,670
Alright, that was close.

6374
08:09:07,000 --> 08:09:07,560
Alright.

6375
08:09:15,910 --> 08:09:17,390
Alright, I should let them heal now.

6376
08:09:20,930 --> 08:09:21,590
Oh, no.

6377
08:09:24,750 --> 08:09:25,630
Alright, nice.

6378
08:09:26,690 --> 08:09:27,510
Oh, I can peek now.

6379
08:09:27,590 --> 08:09:28,230
I can peek!

6380
08:09:30,250 --> 08:09:31,870
I can look now!

6381
08:09:36,030 --> 08:09:37,530
There's no point in me healing.

6382
08:09:40,910 --> 08:09:48,530
gotta i don't need heal if it's like i'm just oh no hawka we

though not him oh my god

6385
08:10:17,040 --> 08:10:21,720
Goodbye I had a feeling I was about to run away.

6386
08:10:24,740 --> 08:10:28,220
I I was about to run away

6387
08:10:31,360 --> 08:10:53,040
Yeah Oh, why are you hitting me for?

6388
08:10:54,420 --> 08:10:55,320
Oh, no.

6389
08:10:56,000 --> 08:11:09,120
Oh, no, there was nothing I could do the current score is
zero two three time to switch things counterplay we play

6390
08:11:09,120 --> 08:11:25,480
cloak but you'll need a top in this stronger there is a way
as you play cloak that's literally it i guess i'll go cloak

6391
08:11:29,220 --> 08:11:32,140
can go do a support with Jeff and Cloak.

6392
08:11:36,670 --> 08:11:38,330
Cloak also is possible.

6393
08:11:38,930 --> 08:11:40,470
As long as they don't hit the alt.

6394
08:11:42,130 --> 08:11:42,770
That's the thing.

6395
08:11:43,770 --> 08:11:45,870
As long as they don't hit it.

6396
08:11:59,430 --> 08:12:00,270
Alright, here we go.

6397
08:12:01,690 --> 08:12:07,610
You can stack it, but it's not really a good investment to
stack it.

6398
08:12:08,090 --> 08:12:10,510
In overall, but...

6399
08:12:13,900 --> 08:12:23,300
But cloak does work if they none of no one shoots the all if
no one shoots it will be fine That's just that you know in

6400
08:12:23,300 --> 08:12:25,820
the perfect world and a perfect world

6401
08:12:30,020 --> 08:12:32,840

There is...

6423
08:13:43,320 --> 08:13:46,220
The positive is...

6424
08:13:48,200 --> 08:13:48,540
Technically...

6425
08:13:48,880 --> 08:13:52,240
No one is toxic, so I count those.

6426
08:13:53,900 --> 08:14:01,920

08:22:29,440 --> 08:22:31,600
And then they're running triple.

6512
08:22:32,660 --> 08:22:33,940
Oh, my God.

6513
08:22:34,100 --> 08:22:37,040
They want to win so bad.

6514
08:22:40,680 --> 08:22:41,120
Oh,

6515
08:22:44,480 --> 08:22:45,780
my God.

6516
08:22:55,160 --> 08:22:56,120
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

6517
08:22:56,260 --> 08:22:56,880
I have to reload.

6518
08:23:06,230 --> 08:23:07,530
Can any of us touch point?

6519
08:23:07,930 --> 08:23:08,670
Yeah, we can.

6520
08:23:24,220 --> 08:23:24,780
Stop healing.

6521
08:23:25,020 --> 08:23:25,300
Stop.

6522
08:23:25,920 --> 08:23:26,220
Oh, wait.

6523
08:23:26,300 --> 08:23:26,520
Never mind.

6524
08:23:26,620 --> 08:23:26,980
Don't stop.

6525
08:23:27,220 --> 08:23:27,880
Actually, don't stop.

6526
08:23:28,260 --> 08:23:29,620
Actually, do not stop healing.

6527
08:23:29,840 --> 08:23:30,540
That was my bad.

6528
08:23:31,300 --> 08:23:33,580
That was actually my bad for suggesting that.

6529
08:23:34,380 --> 08:23:34,860
Oh

6530
08:23:37,900 --> 08:23:40,140
Does he is he get res or not?

6531
08:23:40,480 --> 08:23:41,220
Should we go in without it?

6532
08:23:41,340 --> 08:23:42,360
Let's fucking go in without him.

6533
08:23:42,580 --> 08:23:58,960
Fuck it That's all right I realized that made me All right,
we got one support out One support is out All right

6534
08:24:03,210 --> 08:24:14,430
Okay They really went Triple support Loki, Gambit, Medica.

6535
08:24:15,250 --> 08:24:17,850
Why am I not on that team?

6536
08:24:18,670 --> 08:24:20,030
I could have been their Loki player.

6537
08:24:20,290 --> 08:24:21,570
I could have been their Gambit player.

6538
08:24:21,850 --> 08:24:23,390
I could have even been their club player.

6539
08:24:26,390 --> 08:24:29,850
And nobody wants to play Loki.

6540
08:24:32,850 --> 08:24:35,310
You know, they could even play Gambit.

6541
08:24:35,330 --> 08:24:35,490
it.

6542
08:24:35,730 --> 08:24:38,010
You know, you know what's fun to play?

6543
08:24:38,670 --> 08:24:40,370
Oh, ready, you guys?

6544
08:24:40,570 --> 08:24:41,910
Yeah, but never bust!

6545
08:24:45,770 --> 08:24:47,570
No, we could, like, literally burst that.

6546
08:24:50,690 --> 08:24:52,170
Oh, my God.

6547
08:24:52,790 --> 08:24:55,170
And all we have is rocket.

6548
08:24:55,410 --> 08:24:57,790
Lord, plus, plus, plus, rocket.

6549
08:25:02,630 --> 08:25:05,230
Yeah, but now we're going...

6550
08:25:05,330 --> 08:25:07,510
The thing is, it doesn't matter.

6551
08:25:08,570 --> 08:25:09,130
You don't!

6552
08:25:10,210 --> 08:25:12,410
You can't even play Loki!

6553
08:25:13,270 --> 08:25:14,830
Oh my, oh my, they do have a moon night.

6554
08:25:15,230 --> 08:25:16,270
They do have a moon night, though.

6555
08:25:16,430 --> 08:25:16,990
They do have a moon night.

6556
08:25:17,090 --> 08:25:17,590
We can't.

6557
08:25:17,810 --> 08:25:20,490
We have one tank, though, for this, which is not ideal.

6558
08:25:23,150 --> 08:25:25,950
Oh my god, I think he's dead, guys.

6559
08:25:26,610 --> 08:25:27,810
I think he's dead.

6560
08:25:30,470 --> 08:25:31,330
I think he's dead.

6561
08:25:39,780 --> 08:25:57,420
I don't I don't think so I you know like I cope a lot but
even even then even then I feel like even then I think this

6562
08:25:57,420 --> 08:26:06,400
is actually uncopable I think I don't think you can even
cope on something like this I mean I can low here

6563
08:26:12,730 --> 08:26:14,550
Does he not play Loki?

6564
08:26:14,950 --> 08:26:16,730
Loki is not that hard, buddy.

6565
08:26:18,090 --> 08:26:20,410
You fucking put drones and then you...

6566
08:26:20,410 --> 08:26:21,390
No, no.

6567
08:26:21,410 --> 08:26:26,450
The battle starts in five, four, three, two, one.

6568
08:26:27,710 --> 08:26:29,130
All you need to do is capture the mission.

6569
08:26:29,170 --> 08:26:31,190
We need some kills.

6570
08:26:31,650 --> 08:26:32,470
Ha ha ha!

6571
08:26:46,670 --> 08:26:48,070
That's crazy.

6572
08:26:59,300 --> 08:27:00,720
That's actually insane.

6573
08:27:01,440 --> 08:27:02,920
That's actually insane.

6574
08:27:04,120 --> 08:27:04,260
Oh.

6575
08:27:08,560 --> 08:27:09,360
Oh my god.

6576
08:27:10,060 --> 08:27:10,480
I need one more.

6577
08:27:10,540 --> 08:27:10,920
I need one more.

6578
08:27:11,040 --> 08:27:11,440
I need one more.

6579
08:27:11,580 --> 08:27:12,580
I need one

6580
08:27:20,960 --> 08:27:21,820
more.

6581
08:27:21,820 --> 08:27:22,240
All right.

6582
08:27:24,160 --> 08:27:24,660
All right.

6583
08:27:25,220 --> 08:27:28,280
We have one more Gambit never follows if you want to.

6584
08:27:28,400 --> 08:27:29,240
Oh, we don't need to use it.

6585
08:27:29,300 --> 08:27:29,620
We don't need it.

6586
08:27:31,240 --> 08:27:32,220
We actually...

6587
08:27:32,220 --> 08:27:32,720
No, no, no, no!

6588
08:27:33,680 --> 08:27:34,000
All right.

6589
08:27:44,200 --> 08:27:45,220
All right, whatever.

6590
08:27:47,560 --> 08:27:49,280
We lost the alt rotation, though.

6591
08:27:50,000 --> 08:27:54,760
We might have lost the alt rotation, which is what I'm
afraid of.

6592
08:27:57,040 --> 08:27:59,120
We might have lost the alt rotation.

6593
08:28:02,660 --> 08:28:03,860
We maybe...

6594
08:28:10,590 --> 08:28:11,590
Oh no.

6595
08:28:12,570 --> 08:28:13,590
Oh no.

6596
08:28:13,910 --> 08:28:14,010
Oh no.

6597
08:28:25,130 --> 08:28:26,630
Oh my god, what's going on?

6598
08:28:31,270 --> 08:28:32,350
Oh my...

6599
08:28:32,350 --> 08:28:33,850

6604
08:28:46,750 --> 08:28:50,630
I need you guys to stop healing for me.

6605
08:28:52,530 --> 08:28:53,070

6620
08:31:15,740 --> 08:31:18,320
Did I not say...

6621
08:31:20,020 --> 08:31:22,100
Okay, I said me first.

6622
08:31:23,140 --> 08:31:24,400
I...

6623
08:31:36,720 --> 08:31:39,960
Did I...

6624
08:31:47,960 --> 08:31:54,200
Did I not say me first?

6625
08:32:13,600 --> 08:32:15,100
I'm like...

6626
08:32:18,560 --> 08:32:19,560
Rocket...

6627
08:32:21,540 --> 08:32:22,540
Yeah.

6628
08:32:23,580 --> 08:32:24,780
It's a sign.

6629
08:32:25,660 --> 08:32:27,380
He was like, yeah.

6630
08:32:27,880 --> 08:32:28,140
Yeah.

6631
08:32:34,490 --> 08:32:58,590
Bro Like he's like No, no, no Reset Oh my Yes Alright, back
to the mines Wait, 248.dash 248.dash Alright, that makes

6632
08:32:58,590 --> 08:33:03,890
sense Back to Here I was like

6633
08:33:12,610 --> 08:33:21,930
Help Help you Gamp it all first Gamp it always first When
did it?

6634
08:33:22,350 --> 08:33:34,170
It never stopped being No, he didn't admit it The rest of
our team admitted it The rest of our team was like Oh was

6635
08:33:34,170 --> 08:33:35,890
just in awe.

6636
08:33:39,110 --> 08:33:42,270
I'm just like, I swear to God.

6637
08:33:42,790 --> 08:33:44,950
We all saw it, right?

6638
08:33:45,450 --> 08:33:48,410
I swear to God, we all saw it.

6639
08:33:55,690 --> 08:34:03,710
But even then, it doesn't even need to be verbalized that
Gambit Hulk first.

6640
08:34:04,630 --> 08:34:07,350
It doesn't even need to be a verbalized.

6641
08:34:07,370 --> 08:34:08,130
thing.

6642
08:34:11,930 --> 08:34:20,430
It's just, it's like, it's like, it's like, why it's gamut
first?

6643
08:34:21,090 --> 08:34:24,770
Because gamut first builds all for the team.

6644
08:34:25,830 --> 08:34:26,970
And it's so aggressive.

6645
08:34:27,230 --> 08:34:35,950
It's such a, because gamut first is because when you gamut
all, you gamut all, you can, there's, you most likely can

6646
08:34:35,950 --> 08:34:43,810
just win the entire fight with just gambit all you don't
have to use anything else yeah you take space you aggress

6647
08:34:43,810 --> 08:34:50,930
and then it helps your entire team builds all so if you just
use gambit all you already set the you set the pace of the

6648
08:34:50,930 --> 08:35:02,350
fight and then if they fight back and the gambit all isn't
working use you throw in the other all yeah the other

6649
08:35:02,350 --> 08:35:14,710
support all is like the backup yeah it doesn't matter It's
more so of like Gambit Alt first because you can clean up

6650
08:35:14,710 --> 08:35:16,590
the entire fight with just Gambit Alt.

6651
08:35:16,950 --> 08:35:19,510
If you use a Rocket Alt, you have to use a second Alt.

6652
08:35:21,690 --> 08:35:23,470
Why am I crying so much?

6653
08:35:25,970 --> 08:35:29,850
I unfortunately had a very special player last game.

6654
08:35:30,450 --> 08:35:34,850
But now that he's gone, we can go back to our usual face.

6655
08:35:36,390 --> 08:35:40,250
Also, I just realized I had to swap stuff.

6656
08:35:40,270 --> 08:35:46,630
around real quick if I want to use this skin suit

6657
08:35:51,460 --> 08:36:17,860
all right here you go there yeah now I can do this oh that's
too much too close But that kind of violence isn't really my

6658
08:36:17,860 --> 08:36:18,500
style.

6659
08:36:26,640 --> 08:36:27,040
Okay.

6660
08:36:28,920 --> 08:36:30,800
Wait, day 10 hours.

6661
08:36:30,980 --> 08:36:32,020
Which means...

6662
08:36:32,840 --> 08:36:34,860
Which means it's this time.

6663
08:36:35,860 --> 08:36:37,460
It's baby time.

6664
08:36:40,460 --> 08:36:42,100
Oh my god.

6665
08:36:42,240 --> 08:36:42,940
Our food.

6666
08:36:43,500 --> 08:36:43,960

Oh no.

6673
08:37:54,760 --> 08:37:55,540
Oh no.

6674
08:37:55,540 --> 08:37:57,080
Oh, I just almost made it.

6675
08:37:57,620 --> 08:37:59,320
I just almost made it.

6676
08:38:01,140 --> 08:38:01,860
Yes!

6677
08:38:02,720 --> 08:38:03,940
No, I agree.

6678
08:38:05,020 --> 08:38:06,080
I agree.

6679
08:38:06,760 --> 08:38:07,660
Don't you gonna see me again?

6680
08:38:08,760 --> 08:38:10,120
Oh my god.

6681
08:38:10,240 --> 08:38:12,000
That rocket does not deserve my elo.

6682
08:38:13,140 --> 08:38:13,860
That...

6683
08:38:14,600 --> 08:38:17,480
That rocket does not deserve my elo.

6684
08:38:18,000 --> 08:38:21,040
That rocket really does not deserve my elo.

6685
08:38:21,680 --> 08:38:23,760
Oh my god, I wish we had.

6686
08:38:26,200 --> 08:38:28,360
No, it's not the Angela.

6687
08:38:28,800 --> 08:38:30,000
It's literally...

6688
08:38:30,000 --> 08:38:31,760
He gets Bucky pulled.

6689
08:38:32,800 --> 08:38:37,980
He doesn't deserve my elo.

6690
08:38:41,060 --> 08:38:41,740
Yeah.

6691
08:38:45,740 --> 08:38:46,540
Okay.

6692
08:38:48,920 --> 08:38:50,980
Oh my god, there he is.

6693
08:38:51,800 --> 08:38:52,640
I'm sorry.

6694
08:38:52,660 --> 08:38:54,260
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

6695
08:38:54,860 --> 08:38:55,820

6698
08:39:02,000 --> 08:39:02,200
I'm so sorry, Hakka.

6699
08:39:02,540 --> 08:39:04,500
He wanted to pull me.

6700
08:39:04,780 --> 08:39:08,440
He wanted to pull me.

6701
08:39:08,720 --> 08:39:09,560
I'm so sorry.

6702
08:39:10,340 --> 08:39:14,600
I'm sorry.

6703
08:39:15,040 --> 08:39:17,740
It was me or you, buddy.

6704
08:39:18,280 --> 08:39:18,620
It was me or you, buddy.

6705
08:39:19,380 --> 08:39:21,700
It was me or you.

6706
08:39:23,700 --> 08:39:25,800
Oh my god, I'm so...

6707
08:39:30,520 --> 08:39:32,480
They're not big to me!

6708
08:39:32,820 --> 08:39:34,000
It was weird.

6709
08:39:45,620 --> 08:39:50,060
Oh my god,

6710
08:39:55,360 --> 08:39:56,100
I got it the wrong way there.

6711
08:39:58,640 --> 08:40:00,740
Oh my god, I'm sorry!

6712
08:40:11,000 --> 08:40:20,880
I will say I'm gonna say it again this rocket does not
deserve my elo he really does not

That's got it.

6715
08:40:44,210 --> 08:40:46,050
That was a sick-ass pull that I did.

6716
08:40:47,030 --> 08:40:48,350
Did he did he do it?

6717
08:40:52,650 --> 08:40:55,730
Okay, I hope he builds all in time because

6718
08:41:01,740 --> 08:41:07,000

Oh no.

6738
08:42:49,890 --> 08:42:51,370
Last side, strongly last side.

6739
08:42:57,630 --> 08:42:58,350
No!

6740
08:43:00,210 --> 08:43:04,290
You just lose that.

6741
08:43:10,010 --> 08:43:11,210
I just got...

6742
08:43:11,210 --> 08:43:12,490
Wait, why am I still alive?

6743
08:43:12,690 --> 08:43:12,870
Okay.

6744
08:43:13,970 --> 08:43:14,530
No!

6745
08:43:15,270 --> 08:43:16,370
He was dead!

6746
08:43:20,000 --> 08:43:22,680
He just needed to kite it!

6747
08:43:22,780 --> 08:43:27,200
If he kite it, it would work!

6748
08:43:28,380 --> 08:43:29,600
Better stop that vehicle!

6749
08:43:29,880 --> 08:43:38,760
all right he has all i don't think this this club would give
me the same etiquette of like letting me build alt and i

6750
08:43:38,760 --> 08:43:49,580
legitimately like the only reason why i know that is oh oh

6751
08:43:53,080 --> 08:43:55,440
oh my god

6752
08:43:59,020 --> 08:44:02,880
i'm pulling him in oh let's hope

6753
08:44:07,950 --> 08:44:14,670
Oh That's unlucky.

6754
08:44:15,490 --> 08:44:19,650
I honestly think I'm still need another inch.

6755
08:44:20,090 --> 08:44:21,150
Can I suck?

6756
08:44:21,870 --> 08:44:22,910
What does he play?

6757
08:44:26,690 --> 08:44:28,430
All right

6758
08:44:35,510 --> 08:44:36,690
We got that guy.

6759
08:44:39,790 --> 08:44:41,270
Oh no, they risked.

6760
08:44:47,100 --> 08:44:49,200
I healed as much as I could.

6761
08:44:51,160 --> 08:44:52,640
I healed as much as I could.

6762
08:44:53,300 --> 08:44:55,300
I healed as much as I could.

6763
08:44:56,980 --> 08:44:59,140
Time to switch things up.

6764
08:44:59,500 --> 08:45:01,280
Including which side you're on.

6765
08:45:01,880 --> 08:45:02,600
Oh, man.

6766
08:45:04,300 --> 08:45:04,860
I...

6767
08:45:04,860 --> 08:45:06,740
You know...

6768
08:45:06,740 --> 08:45:08,740
What does he even play?

6769
08:45:11,160 --> 08:45:12,620
Just run triple

6770
08:45:16,460 --> 08:45:18,660
Just triple support

6771
08:45:24,580 --> 08:45:30,860
All right, I'm not the type who fades clearly into the
background All right, we're doing this.

6772
08:45:31,160 --> 08:45:32,560
I run mantis.

6773
08:45:33,280 --> 08:45:37,680
Oh my god, it was a He's a rat player

6774
08:45:42,710 --> 08:45:47,790
Was a rat player Life energy is a powerful weapon.

6775
08:45:48,750 --> 08:45:49,950
I have to play Mantis.

6776
08:45:50,030 --> 08:45:50,690
We're running triple.

6777
08:45:50,810 --> 08:45:51,650
Is I a Mantis?

6778
08:45:51,790 --> 08:45:52,590
Oh, we don't have a Loki.

6779
08:45:52,710 --> 08:45:54,870
If we had a Loki, I would run Adam, but we don't.

6780
08:45:55,250 --> 08:45:57,610
Mantis Peaches put Klintar on top of the list.

6781
08:45:57,630 --> 08:45:58,390
Oh my god.

6782
08:45:58,710 --> 08:46:01,850
I will say that Raccoon does not deserve my Elo.

6783
08:46:02,710 --> 08:46:03,310
I don't care.

6784
08:46:03,670 --> 08:46:10,610
Usually I don't care where my Elo goes to, but this Raccoon
in particular does not deserve my Elo.

6785
08:46:12,650 --> 08:46:14,450
The battle starts in five.

6786
08:46:16,070 --> 08:46:18,090
Careful that Angel pulled outside her.

6787
08:46:18,490 --> 08:46:21,430
Or she's probably gonna pull from right side to left.

6788
08:46:24,130 --> 08:46:24,610
Alright.

6789
08:46:32,410 --> 08:46:33,090
Alright.

6790
08:46:37,330 --> 08:46:39,530
I need to like...

6791
08:46:39,530 --> 08:46:42,130
It's so hard to hit right here.

6792
08:46:43,570 --> 08:46:45,690
Oh, what the fuck?

6793
08:46:52,550 --> 08:46:58,350

08:47:28,980 --> 08:47:30,040
Oh, there we go.

6798
08:47:30,720 --> 08:47:31,300
That easy.

6799
08:47:31,880 --> 08:47:33,140
No res too, by the way.

6800
08:47:34,240 --> 08:47:39,120
There we go.

6801
08:47:39,500 --> 08:47:41,080
Am I?

6802
08:47:41,660 --> 08:47:41,820
Am I?

6803
08:47:41,900 --> 08:47:42,680
We got this.

6804
08:47:50,930 --> 08:47:52,670
All right, there you go.

6805
08:47:53,710 --> 08:47:55,430
Bro, oh my god, that's illegal.

6806
08:47:55,550 --> 08:47:57,070
He's getting healed or some shit.

6807
08:48:01,290 --> 08:48:02,190
All right, here we go.

6808
08:48:02,310 --> 08:48:05,730
Whoa, that all fucking sucks, to be fair.

6809
08:48:06,790 --> 08:48:07,710
Oh, what?

6810
08:48:07,990 --> 08:48:08,390
Okay.

6811
08:48:11,530 --> 08:48:12,930
Oh, my God, we are alone.

6812
08:48:19,200 --> 08:48:19,580
All right.

6813
08:48:21,280 --> 08:48:22,400
All right, me next.

6814
08:48:22,520 --> 08:48:23,680
Solid behind, solid behind, solid behind.

6815
08:48:24,980 --> 08:48:25,360
There we go.

6816
08:48:26,700 --> 08:48:27,180
I'm dead.

6817
08:48:27,560 --> 08:48:27,960
I'm dead.

6818
08:48:28,620 --> 08:48:28,860
I'm dead.

6819
08:48:30,180 --> 08:48:31,520
All right, here we go.

6820
08:48:32,640 --> 08:48:33,240
Oh, my God.

6821
08:48:33,740 --> 08:48:34,600
I'm alive.

6822
08:48:35,440 --> 08:48:36,900
Oh my God!

6823
08:48:38,860 --> 08:48:40,040

To kill me!

6826
08:48:43,480 --> 08:48:44,700

6827
08:48:45,640 --> 08:48:46,900
He doesn't know.

6828
08:48:47,300 --> 08:48:48,220
He doesn't know.

6829
08:48:51,340 --> 08:48:52,360
He doesn't know.

6830
08:48:52,900 --> 08:48:53,900

09:14:23,550 --> 09:14:24,410
That's awkward.

7119
09:14:24,630 --> 09:14:25,250
That's very awkward.

7120
09:14:26,210 --> 09:14:27,510
We don't really have anything.

7121
09:14:29,170 --> 09:14:31,250
Oh, we still don't really have...

7122

It's all right.

7126
09:14:40,490 --> 09:14:42,010
We didn't have anything.

7127
09:14:42,330 --> 09:14:44,510
You know, they they used two us guys.

7128
09:14:44,990 --> 09:14:48,890
That's fine They used two us they used two us.

7129
09:14:49,350 --> 09:14:50,050
That's a trade

Jesus.

7133
09:15:15,980 --> 09:15:22,020
Well, these are one of those moments where I wish I had a
rocket up because this shit is scared.

7134
09:15:25,920 --> 09:15:29,760
I might be dead.

7135
09:15:33,640 --> 09:15:34,040
Okay.

7136
09:15:34,700 --> 09:15:36,820
I mean, that would have, that would have just hit it.

7137
09:15:36,820 --> 09:15:37,520
I think they're saying to you.

7138
09:15:40,660 --> 09:15:42,040
Welcome to the scene, Diego.

7139
09:15:44,140 --> 09:15:44,260
Okay.

7140
09:15:44,940 --> 09:15:46,220
Who was he trying?

7141
09:15:47,660 --> 09:15:48,340
Hello?

7142
09:15:50,200 --> 09:15:51,020
No, guys.

7143
09:15:53,240 --> 09:15:54,540
No, guys.

7144
09:15:55,920 --> 09:16:00,200
Alright, we don't have up, though, so...

7145
09:16:00,200 --> 09:16:01,800
That's the only...

7146
09:16:01,800 --> 09:16:03,680
We have... Oh my god!

7147
09:16:03,880 --> 09:16:05,820
We used everything!

7148
09:16:06,680 --> 09:16:07,280
Hahaha!

7149
09:16:11,500 --> 09:16:13,340
Oh, that's not good.

7150
09:16:26,560 --> 09:16:31,120
I want to use this somewhere else, but I guess not.

7151
09:16:31,900 --> 09:16:33,280
See you, Marcel, sorry.

7152
09:16:35,340 --> 09:16:36,060
That's not your fault, bro.

7153
09:16:39,020 --> 09:16:41,060
Okay, if you peek me, if you peek me, if you peek me, if you
want.

7154
09:16:50,280 --> 09:16:50,820
It's okay.

7155
09:16:51,860 --> 09:16:53,840
We got one of those back.

7156
09:16:53,960 --> 09:16:54,700
I have to kill Connor first.

7157
09:16:54,700 --> 09:16:55,680
We're gonna have to free all of them.

7158
09:17:02,330 --> 09:17:02,970
There we go.

7159
09:17:03,050 --> 09:17:03,290
There we go.

7160
09:17:03,430 --> 09:17:05,270
We have to use both of us again

7161
09:17:09,110 --> 09:17:14,390
Okay Okay, so We have no else again.

7162
09:17:14,530 --> 09:17:15,870
We have I repeat.

7163
09:17:16,050 --> 09:17:18,610
We have no else again What?

7164
09:17:20,310 --> 09:17:22,310
No, no, no, we'll take it.

7165
09:17:22,390 --> 09:17:22,710
We'll take it.

7166
09:17:22,830 --> 09:17:23,150
We'll take it.

7167
09:17:23,270 --> 09:17:23,690
Trust in the value.

7168
09:17:23,910 --> 09:17:27,770
Trust in the value of that all Hey, just kill the pun kill
the pun.

7169
09:17:28,710 --> 09:17:29,810
Oh my god, I'm getting killed

7170
09:17:37,180 --> 09:17:40,500
Um, I do want to know why do we?

7171
09:17:42,160 --> 09:17:42,240
Oh, no.

7172
09:17:44,980 --> 09:17:46,680
I don't think you can hold this around like three.

7173
09:17:47,320 --> 09:17:47,580
All right.

7174
09:17:47,860 --> 09:17:50,360
So why do we all stare at the alt?

7175
09:17:52,300 --> 09:17:58,640
Why do we all, I am a little worried that we all just stared
at it instead of coming back.

7176
09:17:59,120 --> 09:18:01,780
Like, we could have came back the point.

7177
09:18:03,340 --> 09:18:10,760
They're like, don't worry, clearly their team is definitely
not gonna respond or anything.

7178
09:18:11,340 --> 09:18:13,240
Do you want to go?

7179
09:18:13,400 --> 09:18:14,200
I'm off angle as well.

7180
09:18:14,560 --> 09:18:24,260
I don't know what was like the plan there.

7181
09:18:33,580 --> 09:18:35,040
There you go.

7182
09:18:45,940 --> 09:18:47,680
That shit will catch its deepest fuck

7183
09:18:52,880 --> 09:18:54,700
Oh my god, that's so

7184
09:18:57,760 --> 09:19:00,600
Why do they have an iron mesh?

7185
09:19:03,580 --> 09:19:03,720
Yeah!

7186
09:19:05,380 --> 09:19:13,940
I actually pumped my fist up after that Oh my god, I'm such
a nerd I'm such a fucking nerd I actually I pumped my fist

Luffy is like, yeah, I literally just did that.

7188
09:19:21,860 --> 09:19:24,340
God damn, I'm such a fucking nerd.

7189
09:19:30,440 --> 09:19:33,000
I gotta avoid you.

7190
09:19:38,300 --> 09:19:40,480
Oh my god.

7191
09:19:44,920 --> 09:19:46,340
Wait, not Marcel.

7192
09:19:46,740 --> 09:19:48,400
This guy had three...

7193
09:19:48,400 --> 09:19:49,960
This guy was not real.

7194
09:19:54,900 --> 09:20:00,460
I'm pumping your fist at midnight during Marvel Rival's win.

7195
09:20:00,900 --> 09:20:03,180
I've sunk that low.

7196
09:20:05,320 --> 09:20:09,240
I've hit that point in my cues.

7197
09:20:09,400 --> 09:20:10,560
I really have.

7198
09:20:17,660 --> 09:20:18,220

09:20:34,280 --> 09:20:34,580
Ah.

7202
09:20:35,540 --> 09:20:38,300

For no reason.

Wait, how does our Luna have 91?

7389
09:42:26,440 --> 09:42:28,880
He is so lucky I'm a gamer.

7390
09:42:30,300 --> 09:42:31,540
Oh my god, please.

7391
09:42:36,890 --> 09:42:40,170
Guys, I should have avoided the Luna as well.

7392
09:42:40,850 --> 09:42:41,310
I...

7393
09:42:42,670 --> 09:42:44,410

Yeah.

7399
09:43:28,590 --> 09:43:41,850
Like, wouldn't it be fucking cool if really we're gonna kill
Cat when they're free pushing the car for 20 years.

7400
09:43:42,430 --> 09:43:44,410
Alright, five minute dream home.

7401
09:43:45,250 --> 09:43:46,290
Don't worry.

7402
09:43:46,710 --> 09:43:47,050
This will head.

7403
09:43:47,290 --> 09:43:47,910
This will make it.

7404
09:43:47,970 --> 09:43:49,250
This did not make it

7405
09:43:52,870 --> 09:43:58,750
I don't even think I should even come anymore for this game.

7406
09:43:58,750 --> 09:43:59,210
I

7407
09:44:04,140 --> 09:44:21,580

Um, okay.

09:44:42,400 --> 09:44:46,520
Okay, we backed up so, so far.

7412
09:44:49,680 --> 09:44:51,580
We, we backed up so far.

7413
09:44:51,600 --> 09:45:06,520
backed up so far i don't even know where our spawn is why do
we back up so far i'm sorry right sometimes it'd be like

7414
09:45:06,520 --> 09:45:08,800

7415
09:45:13,150 --> 09:45:19,390

Oh my god.

7420
09:45:33,030 --> 09:45:33,650
Oh my god.

7421
09:45:33,770 --> 09:45:37,690
Look, I killed as much as I could.

7422
09:45:39,870 --> 09:45:47,590
The only thing I know is that I technically got more else
than our Luna.

7423
09:45:49,110 --> 09:45:54,530
Technically, If you think about it Okay, just fight in
there.

7424
09:45:55,030 --> 09:45:56,230
Why didn't you fight in there?

7425
09:46:11,920 --> 09:46:13,220
Please keep me up.

7426
09:46:13,520 --> 09:46:13,620
No!

7427
09:46:22,210 --> 09:46:24,230
I always just what?

7428
09:46:26,130 --> 09:46:29,190
Ah, you are Luna.

7429
09:46:29,550 --> 09:46:39,290
Time to switch things up, including which side you're- That
I will say You'll need a top-notch team if you need help you

7430
09:46:39,290 --> 09:46:52,850
don't have to play Luna oh thank God oh thank God she could
have done that in the beginning but oh thank God all I'm

7431
09:46:52,850 --> 09:47:00,370
saying she had the choice to not play Luna

7432
09:47:03,690 --> 09:47:11,210
but unfortunately free will is a thing It's very
unfortunate.

7433
09:47:20,600 --> 09:47:22,680
Very, very unfortunate.

7434
09:47:25,900 --> 09:47:26,500
Yay.

7435
09:47:29,300 --> 09:47:32,880
I just think, other than...

7436
09:47:32,880 --> 09:47:34,680
I'm very tired of seeing Moon Knight Groot.

7437
09:47:34,840 --> 09:47:36,260
I'm actually very...

7438
09:47:36,260 --> 09:47:39,040
Like, I feel like that has been, like, majority...

7439
09:47:39,040 --> 09:47:40,360
I hate this meta, actually.

7440
09:47:40,920 --> 09:47:43,460
Other than Dive, this meta fucking sucks.

7441
09:47:43,940 --> 09:47:45,560
Because there's no counterplay.

7442
09:47:45,580 --> 09:47:46,840
It's like Reaper bait.

7443
09:47:47,000 --> 09:47:52,220
There's literally, there's literally like no counterplay to
this.

7444
09:47:53,220 --> 09:47:53,860
I feel it.

7445
09:47:55,800 --> 09:47:59,320
Like other comp, like there's like other counterplay.

7446
09:47:59,640 --> 09:48:01,200
It's just literally just don't group up.

7447
09:48:01,460 --> 09:48:02,360
That's like the counterplay.

7448
09:48:02,480 --> 09:48:04,240
And I think that's just fucking stupid.

7449
09:48:08,760 --> 09:48:11,180
I just think there should be more counterplay.

7450
09:48:16,250 --> 09:48:18,210
I just don't like this current meta.

7451
09:48:20,030 --> 09:48:25,730
I feel like this meta could definitely be improved on.

7452
09:48:29,470 --> 09:48:30,850
Just not a fan.

7453
09:48:31,010 --> 09:48:31,810
I'm just not a fan.

7454
09:48:32,210 --> 09:48:34,810
Just because like, what can you do when they have the group
combo?

7455
09:48:36,050 --> 09:48:36,310
Really.

7456
09:48:36,730 --> 09:48:38,170
Just literally don't get hit.

7457
09:48:38,630 --> 09:48:40,590
Don't just don't get hit for it, you know?

7458
09:48:40,930 --> 09:48:44,250
Just don't get hit for it.

7459
09:48:45,730 --> 09:48:48,470
Just don't get hit for it.

7460
09:48:50,070 --> 09:48:51,610
Well, let's hope he's a lap

7461
09:48:55,710 --> 09:49:01,310
Oh my god, here we go That should be ours, by the way

7462
09:49:05,030 --> 09:49:17,190
Wow Maybe it was easier Why the fuck is not on captain no
more They're pot right now Phoenix potting Oh, that's

7463
09:49:17,190 --> 09:49:22,410
unfortunate Oh that's unfortunate buddy

7464
09:49:27,910 --> 09:49:45,730
well don't worry we got this right oh there's the hot guy um
i don't want to push up

7465
09:49:53,130 --> 09:49:55,270
Are you gonna look this or me?

7466
09:49:55,910 --> 09:49:57,210
Because I don't really want to look this.

7467
09:50:00,430 --> 09:50:01,510
Maybe Doki Ultra?

7468
09:50:03,650 --> 09:50:04,450
Oh, hey, nice.

7469
09:50:04,690 --> 09:50:05,450
We did it.

7470
09:50:05,970 --> 09:50:06,250
Nice.

7471
09:50:06,490 --> 09:50:06,830
Here you go.

7472
09:50:08,010 --> 09:50:08,290
Yay!

7473
09:50:10,730 --> 09:50:11,390
Good ult.

7474
09:50:12,790 --> 09:50:14,530
Um, we used three ults.

7475
09:50:14,870 --> 09:50:15,650
Is it really good?

7476
09:50:19,410 --> 09:50:21,590
What the fuck?

7477
09:50:22,550 --> 09:50:23,210
Are they alive?

7478
09:50:23,870 --> 09:50:25,250
Oh, they are.

7479
09:50:25,490 --> 09:50:27,710
Oh, not him, though.

7480
09:50:28,730 --> 09:50:30,710
I think it doesn't make me easier.

7481
09:50:31,190 --> 09:50:35,810
We may be chasing everybody.

7482
09:50:37,830 --> 09:50:41,550
Why did we play this at first?

7483
09:50:44,230 --> 09:50:45,650
Wait a minute.

7484
09:50:45,730 --> 09:50:47,850
You mean we could have just played this?

7485
09:50:48,810 --> 09:50:49,950
As an Invis?

7486
09:50:53,050 --> 09:50:58,910
Wait, is there...

7487
09:50:58,910 --> 09:51:00,430
No Hawkeye, no Hawkeye, no Hawkeye.

7488
09:51:01,750 --> 09:51:02,250
Okay.

7489
09:51:03,510 --> 09:51:06,030
That's very ambitious.

7490
09:51:08,870 --> 09:51:10,530
Oh, he jumped forward.

7491
09:51:10,970 --> 09:51:11,810
Back up, back up, back up.

09:51:21,700 --> 09:51:25,160

09:53:11,940 --> 09:53:27,080

He's not alive.

7508
09:54:19,660 --> 09:54:20,180
He's not.

7509
09:54:21,280 --> 09:54:23,440
But I think this is gone now.

7510
09:54:25,900 --> 09:54:26,520
Oh my god.

7511
09:54:26,840 --> 09:54:26,840

7516
09:54:32,340 --> 09:54:33,780
Why are you still fighting?

7517
09:54:34,680 --> 09:54:36,640
Why are you trying to fight the bush?

7518
09:54:37,940 --> 09:54:39,040
I didn't.

7519
09:54:40,800 --> 09:54:43,440
Why did you try to fight the bush?

7520
09:54:49,700 --> 09:54:51,460
Why did she...

7521
09:54:52,200 --> 09:54:53,920
Her team would die!

7522
09:54:57,900 --> 09:54:59,120
I need a portal.

7523
09:55:00,300 --> 09:55:16,000
Oh my god, there's so many questions!

I... We made it a lot further.

7537
09:57:06,800 --> 09:57:08,400
You're a tank player?

7538
09:57:12,510 --> 09:57:13,590
Oh, no.

7539
09:57:13,990 --> 09:57:15,810
I lose the rocket, though.

7540
09:57:16,170 --> 09:57:17,050
I have this.

7541
09:57:17,510 --> 09:57:20,150
Maybe... Maybe he doesn't come back.

7542
09:57:20,570 --> 09:57:22,970
Maybe the rocket doesn't come back.

7543
09:57:23,730 --> 09:57:26,350
That Vayna's been playing this game as long as I have.

7544
09:57:27,910 --> 09:57:28,390
I did.

7545
09:57:28,470 --> 09:57:29,010
I avoided.

7546
09:57:31,750 --> 09:57:33,750
I avoided it, but it's okay.

7547
09:57:34,670 --> 09:57:37,270
There's one thing that will make me feel better.

7548
09:59:10,370 --> 09:59:11,490
When will we stop?

7549
09:59:13,470 --> 09:59:14,350
Rivals is light.

7550
09:59:17,050 --> 09:59:19,290
Rivals is air.

7551
09:59:21,630 --> 09:59:22,670
Rivals is eternal.

7552
09:59:46,890 --> 09:59:48,430
Can't stop me.

7553
09:59:49,850 --> 09:59:58,750

On rivals, guys.

7615
10:05:43,200 --> 10:05:43,680

That's awkward for me, though.

7626
10:06:40,140 --> 10:06:40,600
It's really awkward.

7627
10:06:40,940 --> 10:06:42,580
That's why my frame has been so bad.

third eye for that.

7701
10:12:50,080 --> 10:12:51,860
You need a top-notch team to win this one.

7702
10:12:52,080 --> 10:12:54,680
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

7703
10:13:01,320 --> 10:13:01,900
What do I...

7704
10:13:01,900 --> 10:13:03,540

7705
10:13:04,360 --> 10:13:04,880
All right.

7706
10:13:04,980 --> 10:13:07,280
As long as they're not a support player,

7707
10:13:11,580 --> 10:13:12,540

7708
10:13:14,280 --> 10:13:14,760

All right, I'll look at their profile.

7710
10:13:26,240 --> 10:13:28,660
If they are not a support player, I'll play.

7711
10:13:29,600 --> 10:13:32,900
I'm going to steal their duo just for the memes.

7712
10:13:38,940 --> 10:13:43,680
But guys, homewrecking is bad, but if you do it in-game,
it's pretty funny.

7713
10:13:46,080 --> 10:13:48,960
If you break up an E date, it's pretty funny.

7714
10:13:51,280 --> 10:13:52,760

10:16:03,440 --> 10:16:03,800
Oh.

7727
10:16:04,860 --> 10:16:04,960
Oh.

7728
10:16:04,960 --> 10:16:06,360
You still got somebody?

7729
10:16:13,750 --> 10:16:14,950
Um...

7730
10:16:14,950 --> 10:16:19,820
There you go, that's fine.

7731
10:16:22,020 --> 10:16:22,620
Um...

7732
10:16:23,220 --> 10:16:24,440
My team...

7733
10:16:26,560 --> 10:16:27,760
Um...

7734
10:16:27,760 --> 10:16:28,740
My team...

7735
10:16:29,460 --> 10:16:30,040
My team...

7736
10:16:32,020 --> 10:16:32,580
Um...

7737
10:16:32,580 --> 10:16:33,360
I wanted to...

7738
10:16:33,360 --> 10:16:34,420
Oh, I wanted to...

7739
10:16:37,300 --> 10:16:38,960
I mean, I'm trying.

7740
10:16:42,060 --> 10:16:43,180
I'm trying.

7741
10:16:44,520 --> 10:16:45,080
I...

7742
10:16:46,000 --> 10:16:48,880
How do they get more Moon Knight Alts than us?

7743
10:16:49,260 --> 10:16:53,600
Um, it would be pretty cool if we didn't have a hug.

7744
10:16:54,160 --> 10:16:56,480
Guys, I feel...

7745
10:16:56,480 --> 10:16:58,100
I... I don't know.

7746
10:16:58,520 --> 10:17:00,040
This isn't the time for a slow dance.

7747
10:17:01,600 --> 10:17:03,680
I think...

7748
10:17:03,680 --> 10:17:05,720
I don't know.

7749
10:17:08,700 --> 10:17:10,260
That's just my IMO.

7750
10:17:13,360 --> 10:17:15,500
She almost died.

7751
10:17:18,300 --> 10:17:18,900
Bye, everybody.

7752
10:17:20,080 --> 10:17:20,220

7753
10:17:26,360 --> 10:17:27,860
Alright, Hulk.

7754
10:17:28,120 --> 10:17:28,720

7755
10:17:29,220 --> 10:17:30,200

7756
10:17:30,420 --> 10:17:31,680

7757
10:17:35,540 --> 10:17:36,360
Um...

7758
10:17:39,460 --> 10:17:41,920
I don't...

7759
10:17:41,920 --> 10:17:43,220
I don't know.

7760
10:17:45,300 --> 10:17:47,520

7761
10:17:48,460 --> 10:17:50,640

Obviously.

7765
10:18:03,520 --> 10:18:05,820
We don't mess with the amazing Spider-Man.

7766
10:18:07,800 --> 10:18:08,660
There he is live.

7767
10:18:10,700 --> 10:18:13,520

7768
10:18:22,880 --> 10:18:23,600

7775
10:18:38,440 --> 10:18:39,160

7776
10:18:40,460 --> 10:18:43,140

7789
10:20:24,550 --> 10:20:25,310

Can we play?

7796
10:21:32,730 --> 10:21:33,470
This was...

7797
10:21:33,470 --> 10:21:37,110
This person was never loyal in the first place.

7798
10:21:37,810 --> 10:21:39,210
No hesitation.

7799
10:21:40,110 --> 10:21:42,070
Left their due...

7800
10:21:42,070 --> 10:21:43,470
Zero hesitation.

7801
10:21:44,350 --> 10:21:48,310
Asked me to play with them.

7802
10:21:49,170 --> 10:21:53,350
And then the other guy was like, No, don't leave.

7803
10:21:53,910 --> 10:21:55,010
Don't leave.

7804
10:21:55,470 --> 10:21:59,870
And then zero hesitation came to me.

7805
10:22:01,210 --> 10:22:02,150
It was a test.

7806
10:22:02,550 --> 10:22:03,450
I was testing.

7807
10:22:03,910 --> 10:22:12,430
If you're seeing this right now, Nyla, that man chose bros
before hos.

7808
10:22:13,330 --> 10:22:14,390
Or hos before bros.

7809
10:22:14,610 --> 10:22:15,290
I don't fucking know.

7810
10:22:15,570 --> 10:22:16,530
Whatever it is.

7811
10:22:17,010 --> 10:22:20,350
That man didn't choose you.

7812
10:22:21,970 --> 10:22:23,250
Not up.

7813
10:22:23,590 --> 10:22:24,490
You're welcome.

7814
10:22:25,110 --> 10:22:26,250
You're fucking welcome.

Now you know.

7816
10:22:28,150 --> 10:22:29,830
It ain't worth it.

7817
10:22:33,260 --> 10:22:35,340
That guy ain't loyal.

7818
10:22:38,080 --> 10:22:40,760
They're willing to drop you so quickly.

7819
10:22:42,140 --> 10:22:43,080
Guy ain't loyal.

7820
10:22:46,580 --> 10:22:47,360

10:22:48,580 --> 10:22:50,100

That's just evil.

7834
10:24:47,360 --> 10:24:49,040
Don't worry.

7835
10:24:49,600 --> 10:24:49,940
Whoa.

7836
10:24:50,240 --> 10:24:51,340
Wait, they canceled me.

7837
10:24:51,400 --> 10:24:53,520
Okay, I was gonna say why did they cancel?

That guy was going to cheat on his duo no matter what.

That is true.

7853
10:27:53,620 --> 10:27:55,300
That is so true.

7854

What did I do?

7860
10:29:01,840 --> 10:29:02,780
Evidence one.

10:29:12,280 --> 10:29:13,740
And then I submit.

7866
10:29:14,500 --> 10:29:18,380
Leave evidence three where he added me.

7867
10:29:18,960 --> 10:29:20,860
And then I submitted evidence four.

7868
10:29:21,840 --> 10:29:23,100
Leave your duel.

7869
10:29:23,880 --> 10:29:25,140
Zero hesitation.

7870
10:29:31,740 --> 10:29:34,860

7871
10:29:36,920 --> 10:29:38,860

7872
10:29:42,020 --> 10:29:42,740
No, no, no, no, no.

7873
10:29:43,140 --> 10:29:46,280
He added me first.

7874
10:29:46,860 --> 10:29:47,600

Alright, it's fine.

We got point.

7905
10:33:17,160 --> 10:33:18,440
What are we aiming at?

7906
10:33:20,040 --> 10:33:22,400
Why didn't your duo say?

7907
10:33:22,660 --> 10:33:24,000
That's a good question.

7908
10:33:24,520 --> 10:33:25,280
Wait, Jokey.

7909
10:33:25,440 --> 10:33:27,420
I rushed your games in Bougar Bash.

7910
10:33:27,780 --> 10:33:28,300
That...

7911
10:33:28,300 --> 10:33:28,500
What?

7912
10:33:29,580 --> 10:33:30,480
Wait, what?

7913
10:33:30,580 --> 10:33:31,280
What did he say?

7914
10:33:32,620 --> 10:33:34,160
I couldn't hear him.

7915
10:33:34,780 --> 10:33:36,000
What did he say?

7916
10:33:36,960 --> 10:33:38,820
having my own conversation.

7917
10:33:46,380 --> 10:33:50,260
Okay, I got a little scared here.

7918
10:33:51,360 --> 10:33:52,620
Oh, you watched my game?

7919
10:33:53,620 --> 10:33:54,500
Oh, that's cool.

7920
10:33:55,180 --> 10:33:56,040
Let's go.

7921
10:33:56,320 --> 10:33:58,120
You watched my game, guys.

7922
10:34:01,880 --> 10:34:02,740
It's okay.

7923
10:34:02,940 --> 10:34:05,060
Oh my god, wait, this guy's smart.

7924
10:34:05,380 --> 10:34:05,860
Wait.

7925
10:34:07,260 --> 10:34:07,900
Yoink.

7926
10:34:08,940 --> 10:34:10,000
My duel now.

7927
10:34:16,020 --> 10:34:19,560
Wait, that's a go-to cleanse.

7928
10:34:20,640 --> 10:34:20,640
Wait,

7929
10:34:25,040 --> 10:34:27,300
this guy, this guy know- this guy's smart.

7930
10:34:27,880 --> 10:34:29,020
He knows what he's doing.

7931
10:34:31,900 --> 10:34:33,620
I should really swap off.

7932
10:34:33,840 --> 10:34:35,240
I will swap eventually.

7933
10:34:41,240 --> 10:34:42,940
Let's hope we live.

7934
10:34:46,940 --> 10:34:49,560
Look, it was a good effort.

7935
10:34:49,880 --> 10:34:55,880
All right, now, now, it was truly a very good effort when we
did there.

7936
10:34:56,220 --> 10:34:58,040
When we did there.

7937
10:34:59,060 --> 10:35:01,180
All right, now I'm playing in this.

7938
10:35:02,420 --> 10:35:05,580
I did live, like, a really long time.

7939
10:35:10,200 --> 10:35:12,160
It's kind of...

7940
10:35:12,160 --> 10:35:13,880
I

7941
10:35:17,580 --> 10:35:32,840
Think what's worse is that I'm not even real I'm virtual I
think that's worse for for her He he left for a virtual

7942
10:35:32,840 --> 10:35:44,060
woman Okay All right

7943
10:35:49,520 --> 10:35:52,960
Okay, guys, I don't know.

7944
10:35:53,080 --> 10:35:56,880

7945
10:36:00,460 --> 10:36:03,780

Oh Son of a bitch Oh my god, jump that

7947
10:36:15,120 --> 10:36:17,100
Twisting that stuff

7948
10:36:21,920 --> 10:36:24,940
Maybe for a Virtual bro, yeah.

7949
10:36:25,940 --> 10:36:28,600
Cosmic rays didn't make me want to be fun.

7950
10:36:29,380 --> 10:36:30,600
Okay, I...

7951
10:36:31,420 --> 10:36:33,340
Wee-yang, that is true.

7952
10:36:35,600 --> 10:36:37,760
That the dude...

7953
10:36:37,760 --> 10:36:40,820
I'm not even real.

7954
10:36:41,080 --> 10:36:42,800
I'm a virtual bro.

7955
10:36:44,780 --> 10:36:46,840
I'm sorry, man.

7956
10:36:46,900 --> 10:36:49,800
And your duo still picked me.

7957
10:36:58,540 --> 10:37:01,300
She's real to me.

7958
10:37:02,980 --> 10:37:08,880
The battle starts in five, four, three, two, one.

7959
10:37:10,080 --> 10:37:12,120
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

7960
10:37:12,480 --> 10:37:13,520
Got it?

7961
10:37:13,900 --> 10:37:14,240
Yeah.

7962
10:37:15,060 --> 10:37:18,940
I prefer teams of four, but now I can make this work.

7963
10:37:20,640 --> 10:37:22,100
Also, I should have just all did that.

7964
10:37:22,340 --> 10:37:26,640
I legitimately thought that we were going to fucking cap
that, but I guess not.

7965
10:37:38,550 --> 10:37:52,930
there we go me cap port me point 24 style we're gonna me cap

Okay, sorry, I inked.

7971
10:38:41,370 --> 10:38:44,370
I did say the moment it happens, I'm going to start inking.

7972
10:38:45,030 --> 10:38:46,530
I did say that.

7973
10:38:46,590 --> 10:38:47,310
I did say that.

7974
10:38:47,470 --> 10:38:48,070
I did say that.

7975
10:38:48,230 --> 10:38:48,950
That is my bad.

7976
10:38:52,510 --> 10:38:55,990
I'm not used to a very smart gambit player.

7977
10:38:56,230 --> 10:38:56,890
That is my bad.

7978
10:38:57,290 --> 10:38:58,470
That is my bad.

7979
10:38:58,950 --> 10:39:00,810
I was not used to that.

7980
10:39:01,070 --> 10:39:06,330
I will have to say, now that I am, I will not ink anymore.

7981
10:39:08,910 --> 10:39:13,230
I'm not used to playing with a smart gambit player in rank.

7982
10:39:13,230 --> 10:39:15,070
They're the spidey in our walk-up.

7983
10:39:17,850 --> 10:39:18,470
Now I know.

7984
10:39:18,770 --> 10:39:19,410
Now I learn.

7985
10:39:19,570 --> 10:39:20,270
Now I learn.

7986
10:39:20,790 --> 10:39:22,310
Stop saying that.

7987
10:39:23,270 --> 10:39:25,930
I think that's something.

7988
10:39:26,170 --> 10:39:27,230
He's staging topside.

7989
10:39:27,670 --> 10:39:28,910
DD topside as well.

7990
10:39:29,590 --> 10:39:29,650
All right.

7991
10:39:30,750 --> 10:39:31,910
All right, here we go.

7992
10:39:32,830 --> 10:39:34,230
We almost have up.

7993
10:39:38,350 --> 10:39:39,470
Oh my god, he's flying.

7994
10:39:39,630 --> 10:39:40,070
How did he know?

7995
10:39:42,290 --> 10:39:43,910
What the fuck?

7996
10:39:45,750 --> 10:39:46,370
What was that?

7997
10:39:48,230 --> 10:39:50,730
Well, I'm so confused what that was.

7998
10:39:51,270 --> 10:39:53,430
Oh my god.

7999
10:39:53,850 --> 10:39:54,570
Oh my god.

8000
10:39:54,710 --> 10:39:55,650
Oh my god.

8001
10:39:56,190 --> 10:39:56,190

10:39:56,710 --> 10:39:58,230
So I, what's going on?

8003
10:39:59,710 --> 10:40:00,210
He did it.

8004
10:40:02,330 --> 10:40:03,770
Like, where did he come from?

8005
10:40:05,010 --> 10:40:06,970
We could probably win next fight with your starboard.

8006
10:40:07,070 --> 10:40:12,030
they swapped off spidey starboard now oh they're trying to
use the combo

He's so smart!

8011
10:40:51,040 --> 10:40:51,640
I'm sorry.

8012
10:40:53,880 --> 10:40:54,800
But...

8013
10:40:54,800 --> 10:40:54,920
Wait,

10:40:59,250 --> 10:41:00,610

10:41:05,290 --> 10:41:07,130
Naila, I'm sorry.

8016
10:41:22,230 --> 10:41:23,430
It's okay.

8017
10:41:29,270 --> 10:41:29,950
It's okay.

8018
10:41:29,950 --> 10:41:34,030
30 seconds before you attack, get ready.

8019
10:41:34,710 --> 10:41:36,050
Never punished.

8020
10:41:38,210 --> 10:41:42,050
Stand aside, let warriors and let Namur show you how a
battle is won.

8021
10:41:43,690 --> 10:41:45,170
Thank you for the 150s there.

8022
10:41:45,450 --> 10:41:46,130

Don't bug it out.

8031
10:42:14,420 --> 10:42:15,800
It is what it is.

8032
10:42:16,020 --> 10:42:18,580
I gave her a valuable life lesson today.

8033
10:42:22,000 --> 10:42:23,940

It's okay.

8200
10:56:52,200 --> 10:56:56,600
That was a little close because, like, I had a, I felt like
I was going to have a heart attack there, but

8201
10:57:00,750 --> 10:57:02,310
I do need...

8202
10:57:04,630 --> 10:57:06,710
It will be nice if they, you know.

8203
10:57:10,570 --> 10:57:13,170
Okay, let's hope that...

8204
10:57:13,170 --> 10:57:15,670
Why is he just walking to me?

8205
10:57:16,270 --> 10:57:16,550
Why?

8206
10:57:17,370 --> 10:57:17,790
What?

8207
10:57:24,170 --> 10:57:29,310
Okay, I would really like it if he's not just slowly, like,
walking towards me.

8208
10:57:29,770 --> 10:57:31,270
That would be very nice.

8209
10:57:37,760 --> 10:57:39,620
Oh my god, we're so close.

8210
10:57:40,120 --> 10:57:41,380

8214
10:58:02,580 --> 10:58:03,220

10:59:23,480 --> 10:59:25,220
I might have to test them both out again.

8224
10:59:25,620 --> 10:59:36,020
I might have to test the other one and we might have to do a
little test on both of them at which part.

8225
10:59:36,340 --> 10:59:38,160

Guys, we need more data to figure it out.

8229
10:59:52,560 --> 10:59:55,360

8230
10:59:57,380 --> 10:59:59,640

Remember, I didn't start this.

8244
11:00:51,000 --> 11:00:53,660
I'm, like, so fucking concerned right now.

8245
11:00:54,480 --> 11:00:55,660
Since the world was...

8246
11:00:55,680 --> 11:01:07,400
turning but i did i might have poured the gas but like is
that really like is that really a bad thing if you think

8247
11:01:07,400 --> 11:01:12,480
about it is that truly bad yes

8248
11:01:16,250 --> 11:01:30,090
what is it okay wait nala's cues gave me an easy ass lobby
nala's cues gave me the thrower lobby oh Guys, write this

8249
11:01:30,090 --> 11:01:30,350
down.

8250
11:01:30,430 --> 11:01:31,590
We gotta, like, collect data.

8251
11:01:32,450 --> 11:01:33,970
Guys, we're collecting data.

8252
11:01:34,770 --> 11:01:37,970
Yeah, I just lit the match and walked, though.

8253
11:01:38,610 --> 11:01:40,010
We gotta collect the data.

8254
11:01:40,690 --> 11:01:44,310
Write it down to see which team is, which duo is better.

8255
11:01:50,830 --> 11:01:52,930
One, two, zero.

8256
11:01:57,410 --> 11:01:58,690
All right.

8257
11:01:59,630 --> 11:02:00,390
All right.

8258
11:02:00,710 --> 11:02:03,670
Now we test out ballet again.

8259
11:02:04,170 --> 11:02:12,730
We gotta compare we got we can't just have one we gotta
compare guys Have you guys are you guys writing it down are

8261
11:02:25,450 --> 11:02:27,190
right, let's let's try it.

8262
11:02:27,230 --> 11:02:31,610
All right, let's try it ballet again Guys, let's try ballet
again.

8263
11:02:32,410 --> 11:02:33,450
Doki the Green.

8264
11:02:35,590 --> 11:02:35,890
Alright.

8265
11:02:42,090 --> 11:02:44,370
Dahlia's win was faster.

8266
11:02:44,570 --> 11:02:45,910
I will admit.

8267
11:02:46,550 --> 11:02:46,970
Nailia's win.

8268
11:02:47,030 --> 11:02:47,790
Guys, write it down.

8269
11:02:48,110 --> 11:02:48,590
Write it down.

8270
11:02:49,070 --> 11:02:51,010
Nailia's win was faster.

8271
11:02:52,810 --> 11:02:54,750
Ballet, I have to try a little harder.

8272
11:02:54,910 --> 11:02:58,050
I actually have to try when I played...

8273
11:02:59,390 --> 11:03:06,470
When I played with Ballet, but I didn't have to try that
hard when I played with Nihila, though.

8274
11:03:11,210 --> 11:03:14,050
Nihila is a great tech and you won faster.

8275
11:03:15,010 --> 11:03:18,210
But Ballet's Gambit was pretty cracked.

8276
11:03:18,530 --> 11:03:19,610
That is true.

8277
11:03:20,310 --> 11:03:22,810
Ballet's Gambit was really cracked.

8278
11:03:26,450 --> 11:03:28,550
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

8279
11:03:35,870 --> 11:03:36,710
All right.

8280
11:03:39,530 --> 11:03:41,070
Unfortunately, we can't get both.

8281
11:03:41,510 --> 11:03:42,770
We have to make a choice.

8282
11:03:42,850 --> 11:03:44,850
Who am I going to banish from this match?

8283
11:03:53,250 --> 11:03:55,030
Wait, does Ballet not have a Twitch account?

8284
11:03:55,110 --> 11:03:56,650
Does he not want to speak for himself?

8285
11:03:57,150 --> 11:03:58,790
Does he not want to defend himself?

8286
11:03:59,410 --> 11:04:00,430
Does he not want to...

8287
11:04:02,030 --> 11:04:13,270
does he not want to give all try to convince chat why we
should pick ballet we're creating this like like oh he's

8288
11:04:13,270 --> 11:04:26,950
scared all right write that down guys you scared nila is
confident ballet is scared let the gameplay speak for them

8289
11:04:26,950 --> 11:04:34,310
yeah note it down he's scared he's shy Pallet is a bitch,
got it.

8290
11:04:40,960 --> 11:04:42,580
You'll need a top notch.

8291
11:04:43,020 --> 11:04:44,260
All right, let's see.

8292
11:04:46,160 --> 11:04:47,920
I will play.

8293
11:04:48,680 --> 11:04:49,460
All right, I will play.

8294
11:04:49,720 --> 11:04:52,000
Ah, choke time.

8295
11:05:00,100 --> 11:05:00,900
All

8296
11:05:04,190 --> 11:05:05,570
right, here we go.

8297
11:05:21,980 --> 11:05:23,600
We got this, guys.

8298
11:05:24,400 --> 11:05:26,940
As a reminder, I am a good person.

8299
11:05:28,300 --> 11:05:31,520
I don't know why I have to keep reminding people that.

8300
11:05:32,960 --> 11:05:34,760
I don't know why people are doubting that.

8301
11:05:35,400 --> 11:05:36,040
Also, this comp.

8302
11:05:36,820 --> 11:05:38,380
This, okay, note this out.

8303
11:05:38,620 --> 11:05:40,620
This is our comp for this game.

8304
11:05:40,760 --> 11:05:41,420
But they will.

8305
11:05:42,040 --> 11:05:43,140
They always do.

8306
11:05:45,440 --> 11:05:48,800
I think this will affect the data.

8307
11:05:49,140 --> 11:05:51,820
Just remember, his performance, you know.

8308
11:05:52,520 --> 11:05:54,260
You know, it might not be him.

8309
11:05:54,400 --> 11:05:57,380
You know, it might be, you know, whatever the fuck our comp
is right now.

8310
11:05:57,560 --> 11:05:58,680
It might be.

8311
11:05:59,560 --> 11:06:02,720
It might be whatever the fuck this comp is.

8312
11:06:08,520 --> 11:06:09,600
Some shit.

8313
11:06:10,440 --> 11:06:11,080
Some shit.

8314
11:06:11,460 --> 11:06:12,700
Oh, no.

8315
11:06:13,100 --> 11:06:14,600

8316
11:06:14,800 --> 11:06:15,640

Yeah, it's me.

8335
11:07:50,820 --> 11:07:51,660

I saw the Hawkeye.

8355
11:09:34,430 --> 11:09:37,570
He looked at me, and I was very scared.

8356
11:09:39,210 --> 11:09:40,630
What the fuck?

11:09:45,070 --> 11:09:47,670

What is the objective?

8368
11:10:24,440 --> 11:10:25,980
Objective is like with data, right?

8369
11:10:26,100 --> 11:10:28,200
Subjective is like with your own opinion, right?

8370
11:10:32,700 --> 11:10:33,780
Ooh, was it me?

8371
11:10:40,880 --> 11:10:42,340

11:10:42,880 --> 11:10:43,280

But he got solo ulted.

8381
11:11:32,260 --> 11:11:33,200
Oh my god.

8382
11:11:36,300 --> 11:11:37,860

It still hits me?

8384
11:11:41,300 --> 11:11:42,920
Sparky's the control.

8385
11:11:43,200 --> 11:11:45,200
A new challenger has appeared.

8386
11:11:50,060 --> 11:11:50,980
Oh my god.

8387
11:11:51,360 --> 11:11:51,780

11:11:53,740 --> 11:11:54,340
Write that down.

8391
11:11:54,880 --> 11:11:56,260
Do you think he's getting nervous?

8392
11:11:59,040 --> 11:12:02,420
Oh, you're right.

8393
11:12:02,520 --> 11:12:04,160
The invisible has been keeping me up too.

8394
11:12:04,380 --> 11:12:04,940
Write that down.

8395
11:12:08,880 --> 11:12:09,660
Oh no.

8396
11:12:09,800 --> 11:12:11,300
Guys, we're making him nervous.

8397
11:12:11,720 --> 11:12:13,360
Guys, we wrote too many things down.

8398
11:12:13,860 --> 11:12:15,520
We wrote too many things down.

8399
11:12:15,700 --> 11:12:16,620
He's nervous now.

8400
11:12:16,620 --> 11:12:19,920
His performance, he's nervous about his performance.

8401
11:12:26,210 --> 11:12:28,910
All right, nice.

8402
11:12:32,370 --> 11:12:35,930
He has performance anxiety.

8403
11:12:42,920 --> 11:12:48,020
I can do it, Mrs. Puppet.

8404
11:12:48,300 --> 11:12:51,000
Sonny, thank you for tier one, so they can thank you.

8405
11:12:53,340 --> 11:12:55,180
But it kept downer.

8406
11:12:55,240 --> 11:12:56,100
Swapping me.

8407
11:12:56,140 --> 11:12:56,900
Oh, no.

8408
11:13:02,000 --> 11:13:03,140
Now, now, I love.

8409
11:13:03,600 --> 11:13:05,320
What would you do in this situation?

8410
11:13:06,160 --> 11:13:09,360
If they keep counter-swapping you, what would you do?

8411
11:13:15,020 --> 11:13:15,700
It's okay.

8412
11:13:15,780 --> 11:13:16,360
No pressure.

8413
11:13:16,600 --> 11:13:17,080
No pressure.

8414
11:13:17,700 --> 11:13:18,500
No pressure, bro.

8415
11:13:18,760 --> 11:13:19,240
Don't worry.

8416
11:13:19,880 --> 11:13:21,240
They'll also go...

8417
11:13:22,020 --> 11:13:22,920
Don't worry.

8418
11:13:24,520 --> 11:13:25,220
Don't worry.

8419
11:13:25,240 --> 11:13:26,580

8439
11:15:10,930 --> 11:15:11,810

8449
11:15:39,660 --> 11:15:41,780
and everybody was getting the lead in there.

8450
11:15:49,120 --> 11:15:51,200
Like, what the fuck?

8451
11:16:00,350 --> 11:16:03,610
There we go.

8452
11:16:03,610 --> 11:16:03,890
Alright.

8453
11:16:06,590 --> 11:16:07,150

Look at that.

8457
11:16:12,410 --> 11:16:12,850
Look at that.

8458
11:16:12,930 --> 11:16:13,370
Look at that.

8459
11:16:14,330 --> 11:16:15,070
Alright, note that.

8460
11:16:15,210 --> 11:16:15,990

Write that down.

8464
11:16:18,850 --> 11:16:19,510
We comboed.

8465
11:16:25,210 --> 11:16:27,550
We had a combo together.

8466
11:16:27,730 --> 11:16:29,710
That's like a synergy plus one.

8467
11:16:30,770 --> 11:16:31,690
If you think about it.

8468
11:16:40,410 --> 11:16:40,750

That's very unlucky, that's very very...

8475
11:17:12,670 --> 11:17:13,710
What the fuck?

8476
11:17:21,760 --> 11:17:25,040
Oh my god, what's going on?

8477
11:17:26,000 --> 11:17:27,800
What's going on?

8478
11:17:32,070 --> 11:17:32,390

I think we can stick to the dude.

8481
11:17:41,700 --> 11:17:43,720
I think we might need like...

8482
11:17:43,720 --> 11:17:45,560
I don't even know what we need.

8483
11:17:48,740 --> 11:17:52,560

11:19:33,360 --> 11:19:35,760
Oh my god, I was going to say he's one.

8496
11:19:36,620 --> 11:19:38,500
Okay, Sparky has been removed from the list.

8497
11:19:42,220 --> 11:19:46,390
Unfortunately, um...

8498
11:19:48,530 --> 11:19:49,210
Uh...

8499
11:19:53,170 --> 11:19:57,110
Unfortunately, I will have to remove Sparky from the list.

8500
11:19:58,190 --> 11:20:01,770
He has, um, disappointed me a little bit.

8501
11:20:06,810 --> 11:20:17,830
he has um i don't know just just a little little
questionable plays there just just a little you know

8502
11:20:22,260 --> 11:20:30,540
the rest of me is it was supposed to be the controller group
but in the end he just oh he just wasn't good enough to be

8503
11:20:30,540 --> 11:20:38,340
in a controller room oh no oh my god wait note that down
That was pretty cool.

8504
11:20:39,980 --> 11:20:41,300
Wait, note that down.

8505
11:20:41,420 --> 11:20:43,660
That was pretty sick what he just did.

8506
11:20:44,260 --> 11:20:44,780
You know that.

8507
11:20:57,890 --> 11:20:58,410
Alright.

8508
11:21:03,010 --> 11:21:03,330
Oh.

8509
11:21:08,090 --> 11:21:10,310
Remove him from the list as well.

8510
11:21:13,450 --> 11:21:15,630
We might have to remove some more.

8511
11:21:15,770 --> 11:21:16,170
No!

8512
11:21:16,390 --> 11:21:17,870
Okay, I got way too old.

8513
11:21:18,690 --> 11:21:21,250
Oh my god, let's...

8514
11:21:31,620 --> 11:21:34,480
Guys, Sparky is so far away from the list.

8515
11:21:35,860 --> 11:21:36,540
Um...

8516
11:21:36,540 --> 11:21:38,640
It removes Invis as well.

8517
11:21:39,160 --> 11:21:42,680
It removes Invis and Sparky from the list.

8518
11:21:48,280 --> 11:21:51,360
That could have been avoided, I will say.

8519
11:21:51,920 --> 11:21:54,560
I felt like that could have been avoided very easily.

8520
11:21:56,820 --> 11:21:57,480
Oh, yeah.

8521
11:22:06,360 --> 11:22:07,320
Oh, my God.

8523
11:22:09,400 --> 11:22:10,080

8524
11:22:10,620 --> 11:22:11,600

The Invis is now banned.

8533
11:22:48,320 --> 11:22:52,360
The Invis has now been banned from any list.

11:26:03,870 --> 11:26:05,630
Put me off the list, guys.

8557
11:26:09,910 --> 11:26:11,190

8558
11:26:11,190 --> 11:26:18,950
I don't know if that was my group wall or their group wall,
but like, I could not do anything.

8559
11:26:21,530 --> 11:26:22,810
Oh, guys.

8560
11:26:23,890 --> 11:26:26,650
I think it's the winnable.

8561
11:26:31,590 --> 11:26:37,070
We don't have any wall buster except

11:30:56,770 --> 11:30:57,750

8596
11:31:08,230 --> 11:31:11,090
Oh, oh, he got me this time.

8597
11:31:14,120 --> 11:31:16,650
You know, I've been waiting.

8598
11:31:16,930 --> 11:31:18,790
I'm waiting for the storm.

8599
11:31:19,050 --> 11:31:20,970
How do I do the storm combo again?

8600
11:31:21,070 --> 11:31:21,870
Do I just press Q?

8601
11:31:22,710 --> 11:31:23,510
What do I do?

8602
11:31:26,390 --> 11:31:27,450
Oh, my God.

8603
11:31:28,710 --> 11:31:29,290
Oh.

8604
11:31:31,130 --> 11:31:32,430
Oh, that's awkward.

8605
11:31:34,870 --> 11:31:36,230
That's awkward.

8606
11:31:39,720 --> 11:31:40,740
That's awkward.

8607
11:31:42,120 --> 11:31:43,860
Doesn't matter now, though.

8608
11:31:44,540 --> 11:31:47,820
Man, I really wanted to do...

8609
11:31:48,380 --> 11:31:49,500
I'm sad.

8610
11:31:49,940 --> 11:31:52,380
I really wanted to do the combo.

8611
11:31:52,680 --> 11:31:54,460
It looked really cool.

8612
11:31:56,540 --> 11:31:58,220
High E though, the lances did work.

8613
11:32:00,080 --> 11:32:02,140
What if I eat you, though?

8614
11:32:03,020 --> 11:32:04,320
That's right.

8615
11:32:06,120 --> 11:32:07,140
I still got it.

8616
11:32:07,200 --> 11:32:08,080
I got it.

8617
11:32:08,080 --> 11:32:10,360
Three, two, six.

8618
11:32:12,320 --> 11:32:13,420
Thank you for the suggestion, bro.

8619
11:32:13,640 --> 11:32:14,020

8621
11:32:18,680 --> 11:32:19,220

8625
11:32:28,160 --> 11:32:28,660

8628
11:32:37,780 --> 11:32:38,560

Or ballet.

8634
11:32:45,960 --> 11:32:46,740
Don't worry, don't worry.

8635
11:32:46,840 --> 11:32:47,560
We'll call you.

8636
11:32:47,720 --> 11:32:48,240

Don't worry, we're gonna give the same...

8643
11:33:07,900 --> 11:33:12,660
Observation, the same observation and notes.

8644

We are, we're doing, there's no biases here.

8645
11:33:18,820 --> 11:33:20,900
There's no, but check the history.

8646
11:33:21,220 --> 11:33:23,500

11:44:51,700 --> 11:44:53,160
I threw that.

8772
11:44:56,700 --> 11:44:58,020
I'm throwing.

8773
11:44:58,360 --> 11:44:59,140
Note that down.

8774
11:44:59,240 --> 11:45:00,320
I'm throwing right now.

8775
11:45:02,900 --> 11:45:03,560
I...

8776
11:45:03,560 --> 11:45:03,880
I'm throwing.

8777
11:45:09,620 --> 11:45:11,820
I definitely threw that.

8778
11:45:12,120 --> 11:45:13,620
I definitely, I threw that.

8779
11:45:13,660 --> 11:45:14,340
You know what, Nyla?

8780
11:45:14,740 --> 11:45:19,260
You can, you can take, I definitely threw that one.

8781
11:45:20,540 --> 11:45:21,760
You get that from me.

8782
11:45:22,020 --> 11:45:23,440
You get that from me.

8783
11:45:24,460 --> 11:45:25,000
That's all right.

8784
11:45:25,040 --> 11:45:26,440
We'll run Nyla again.

8785
11:45:26,880 --> 11:45:33,880
Because I, that test, for that test, I threw that one a
little bit.

8786
11:45:37,760 --> 11:45:49,460
So we get another one She did do really well on DPS I didn't
think I would explode I legitimately didn't think I was just

8787
11:45:49,460 --> 11:45:50,220
like I'll be fine

8788
11:45:56,740 --> 11:46:06,500
I fucked up that suit all leg twice I think it's also
because I've been streaming for hours I have this trip for

8789
11:46:06,500 --> 11:46:08,960
12 hours, so that's on me.

8790
11:46:09,440 --> 11:46:10,880
How this will do...

8791
11:46:10,880 --> 11:46:11,640
Oh, hey, there's T.

8792
11:46:11,760 --> 11:46:12,040
Bennett.

8793
11:46:12,580 --> 11:46:13,160
Isn't that the guy?

8794
11:46:13,220 --> 11:46:13,900
That was the...

8795
11:46:14,880 --> 11:46:16,900
That was the torch guy, right?

8796
11:46:17,040 --> 11:46:17,740
Let's fuck it.

8797
11:46:17,780 --> 11:46:18,820
Let's bring...

8798
11:46:18,820 --> 11:46:19,580
That number.

8799
11:46:19,820 --> 11:46:21,020
Let's bring him in, too.

8800
11:46:25,340 --> 11:46:27,660
No, we'll do one more test.

8801
11:46:28,140 --> 11:46:29,900
We'll run one more test between the two.

8802
11:46:30,280 --> 11:46:31,640
And I'll actually lock in.

8803
11:46:31,700 --> 11:46:32,720
We'll full lock in.

8804
11:46:33,900 --> 11:46:46,980
guys have to write the notes for me though if I'm full
locking in all right I'm gonna get water I'll get back up up

8805
11:46:46,980 --> 11:46:55,620
up all right I'm tapering look that's what I'm saying I'm
gonna full lock in but you guys have to keep notes you have

8806
11:46:55,620 --> 11:46:59,340
to keep tab of everything all

8807
11:48:28,460 --> 11:48:37,820
right before I lock in I gotta disassociate guys if I To
give you guys a...

8808
11:48:40,280 --> 11:48:41,640
Non-bias...

8809
11:48:41,640 --> 11:48:45,200
To give you guys a non-bias...

8810
11:48:46,620 --> 11:48:47,300
Objective...

8811
11:48:47,300 --> 11:48:47,780
Result.

8812
11:48:50,880 --> 11:48:52,160
I gotta do it.

8813
11:48:52,280 --> 11:48:54,260
To make it all fair...

8814
11:48:54,260 --> 11:48:55,800
I gotta fully lock in.

8815
11:48:56,600 --> 11:48:59,300
Performance always improves after disassociation.

8816
11:48:59,460 --> 11:49:00,240
That is true.

8817
11:49:00,780 --> 11:49:02,100
That is very true.

8818
11:49:04,200 --> 11:49:05,840
And I'm gonna play Rocket.

8819
11:49:07,420 --> 11:49:10,620
Now, who am I going to banish from this match?

8820
11:49:14,070 --> 11:49:14,450
All right.

8821
11:49:16,730 --> 11:49:17,990
This is going to work.

8822
11:50:08,580 --> 11:50:10,160
All right, here we go.

8823
11:50:10,640 --> 11:50:11,620

We can do this.

8827
11:50:26,300 --> 11:50:27,320
Oh, my God.

8828
11:50:28,980 --> 11:50:29,180

Here we go.

8831
11:50:35,440 --> 11:50:35,770
Okay.

8832
11:50:36,900 --> 11:50:38,520

8833
11:50:38,700 --> 11:50:40,760

11:50:41,380 --> 11:50:41,680
Alright.

8835
11:50:42,440 --> 11:50:43,460
Here we go.

8836
11:50:44,580 --> 11:50:45,200
Here we go.

8837
11:50:45,580 --> 11:50:46,480
Here we go.

8838
11:50:47,460 --> 11:50:50,460
Goddess of mischief and the queen of Asgard.

8839
11:50:51,620 --> 11:50:53,160
30 seconds before you attack.

8840
11:50:53,480 --> 11:50:53,980

We're gonna try.

8845
11:50:59,060 --> 11:51:00,120
As much as we can.

8846
11:51:02,460 --> 11:51:06,300
Oh my god, the gambit's healing you, not me.

8847
11:51:07,840 --> 11:51:08,420
Alright, here we go.

8848
11:51:08,820 --> 11:51:09,460
Here we go.

8849
11:51:09,720 --> 11:51:10,600

12:18:02,330 --> 12:18:02,750
I'm gonna...

9108
12:18:02,770 --> 12:18:14,090
mute this guy because I know he's gonna start saying shit
time to switch things up including which side you're on team

9109
12:18:15,840 --> 12:18:26,940
to win this one not the room was so close no I felt like he
was gonna say something bad so I got worried he was like

9110
12:18:26,940 --> 12:18:34,360
this close he was this close to see I I don't know.

9111
12:18:35,760 --> 12:18:38,120
But they don't have a high Eelopent.

9112
12:18:38,140 --> 12:18:39,320
I don't even know who banned.

9113
12:18:39,480 --> 12:18:41,880
Who banned the fantastic player, guys?

9114
12:18:44,400 --> 12:18:47,680
He was this close to saying something really bad.

9115
12:18:47,840 --> 12:18:49,440
And I was just like, ooh.

9116
12:18:56,750 --> 12:18:58,850
What's in the cards?

9117
12:19:00,970 --> 12:19:04,550
How come when we get a Hawkeye?

9118
12:19:04,670 --> 12:19:07,650
He doesn't do the shit that the enemy Hawkeye does.

9119
12:19:21,660 --> 12:19:28,500

which is understandable.

9126
12:20:44,070 --> 12:20:44,950
It really is.

9127
12:21:03,660 --> 12:21:05,240

now, guys.

9135
12:21:52,360 --> 12:21:55,280

9174
12:28:59,200 --> 12:29:01,500

9175
12:29:03,640 --> 12:29:05,600

9178
12:29:09,980 --> 12:29:11,440
It's an e-family.

9179
12:29:11,860 --> 12:29:12,440
That's different.

9180
12:29:16,680 --> 12:29:19,920
Nala and ballet were the perfect duo, Turkey.

9181
12:29:22,300 --> 12:29:22,300

9182
12:29:22,660 --> 12:29:23,780

9186
12:29:38,800 --> 12:29:39,960

They're both technically 2-2.

12:31:42,660 --> 12:31:44,640
Perfectly balanced as it should be.

12:42:09,530 --> 12:42:11,850

There is no way.

12:46:37,780 --> 12:46:40,720

It was a Democratic vote.

There was no tampering.

9318
12:47:38,120 --> 12:47:38,900

That was fun, though.

9321
12:47:44,260 --> 12:47:45,680
That was fun.

9322
12:47:46,180 --> 12:47:47,320
That was a good stream.

9323
12:47:49,380 --> 12:47:50,300
I'm tired.

9324
12:47:51,580 --> 12:47:52,480
I didn't...

9325
12:47:52,480 --> 12:47:53,500
You know what's crazy?

9326
12:47:53,740 --> 12:47:57,160
I didn't I'm not hungry at all.

9327
12:47:57,620 --> 12:48:00,480
I did not eat dinner at all today.

9328
12:48:00,820 --> 12:48:01,860
I'm not even...

9329
12:48:01,860 --> 12:48:03,800
I think I just fed off of Rivals.

9330
12:48:04,560 --> 12:48:05,440
It's crazy.

9331
12:48:05,980 --> 12:48:14,220
The craziest thing is that I felt like when we got to
Monday, I had a lot of the curry, to be fair.

9332
12:48:14,320 --> 12:48:15,100
It was really good.

9333
12:48:15,400 --> 12:48:23,560
I felt like when we got to Monday, like when the hours
finally ticked to Monday, especially in the East Coast, the

9334
12:48:23,560 --> 12:48:24,460
lobbies...

9335
12:48:24,480 --> 12:48:27,260
Got a lot nicer.

9336
12:48:27,760 --> 12:48:30,200
Not the game quality, but the people.

9337
12:48:32,080 --> 12:48:33,600
Did that feel that way?

9338
12:48:34,320 --> 12:48:36,740
The moment the weekend ended.

9339
12:48:37,500 --> 12:48:39,400
People got a lot nicer.

9340
12:48:42,040 --> 12:48:43,860
I definitely did.

9341
12:48:45,960 --> 12:48:46,520
Yeah.

9342
12:48:46,900 --> 12:48:49,580
I was just like, I told you DJing Qs.

9343
12:48:49,820 --> 12:48:50,480
That's mob.

9344
12:48:51,100 --> 12:48:54,080
That's, that's mobless.

9345
12:48:54,600 --> 12:48:56,240
DJQs, where is that?

9346
12:48:57,920 --> 12:49:00,600
The people with jobs are all...

9347
12:49:00,600 --> 12:49:01,120
Thank you.

9348
12:49:01,240 --> 12:49:02,240
Jobs and school.

9349
12:49:02,700 --> 12:49:02,900
Yeah.

9350
12:49:05,280 --> 12:49:06,500
There was some...

9351
12:49:06,500 --> 12:49:08,040
Yeah, but like...

9352
12:49:08,040 --> 12:49:10,080
But like, that one...

9353
12:49:10,080 --> 12:49:13,800
I will say that we did have the one racist guy, though, on
our team.

9354
12:49:13,880 --> 12:49:15,280
But like, you know...

9355
12:49:15,280 --> 12:49:18,300
He was very racist, but like...

9356
12:49:18,300 --> 12:49:21,020
He wasn't toxic racist.

9357
12:49:21,280 --> 12:49:21,820
You know?

9358
12:49:21,920 --> 12:49:24,460
He wasn't using that as a way to be toxic.

9359
12:49:24,480 --> 12:49:38,660
To us, but like But like it was still pretty bad It was
still pretty bad, yeah It was not like a shouting match Of

9360
12:49:38,660 --> 12:49:57,380
slurs Yeah He was just a He was just a casual racist Yeah
But he was at But he was was at least playing the game.

9361
12:49:57,940 --> 12:50:06,440
Like the earlier cues, the earlier cues we had were like one
of the guy wanted to slur at this other guy and he was

9362
12:50:06,440 --> 12:50:06,960
throwing.

9363
12:50:07,480 --> 12:50:11,460
But at least like our racist didn't throw this time.

9364
12:50:14,660 --> 12:50:18,960
Our racist didn't, I still reported it because I was like,
bro, that's racist.

9365
12:50:19,360 --> 12:50:22,380
But at least he didn't throw our game.

9366
12:50:27,920 --> 12:50:28,580
yeah

9367
12:50:31,940 --> 12:50:42,280
it's not really that much better but it's actually crazy the
difference between weekend queues and um and like regular

9368
12:50:42,280 --> 12:50:48,980
queues and even the fact that dj queues are better than
weekend queues freaking kris kris kris anyway i'm never

9371
12:51:02,660 --> 12:51:10,740

It was a very fun stream.

9380
12:51:44,700 --> 12:51:46,800
It was a very, very fun stream today.

9381
12:51:48,220 --> 12:51:53,120
We went through a whole journey, like a whole fucking arc
and everything.

9382
12:51:55,060 --> 12:51:57,820
And I always love streaming for you guys.

9383
12:51:58,100 --> 12:51:59,700
I don't know why.

9384
12:52:00,100 --> 12:52:02,180
Rivals just, I can stream Rivals for so long.

9385
12:52:02,360 --> 12:52:04,000
And it was a very fun experience.

9386
12:52:04,860 --> 12:52:10,720
And I mean, well, not the games, though.

9387
12:52:11,140 --> 12:52:12,360
I mean, the games were fun to play.

9388
12:52:12,520 --> 12:52:13,420
The games were fun to play.

9389
12:52:13,600 --> 12:52:21,020
But also, you know, we had, I swear to God, yesterday and
today.

9390
12:52:21,560 --> 12:52:24,460
Yesterday and today had to be the coolest.

9391
12:52:24,480 --> 12:52:37,000
craziest games we've ever had back to back to back and by
crazy i mean the most toxic thing i've ever encountered in

9392
12:52:37,000 --> 12:52:51,360
my history uh streaming this game i don't think we've ever
had so many games like in a row where uh where almost every

9393
12:52:51,360 --> 12:52:56,220
game was just someone throwing Someone's yelling at each
other.

9394
12:52:56,860 --> 12:52:58,360
Someone blaming somebody.

9395
12:52:58,880 --> 12:52:59,940
Someone's shouting.

9396
12:53:00,340 --> 12:53:02,580
Like, oh my god.

9397
12:53:04,020 --> 12:53:04,540
Yeah.

9398
12:53:04,900 --> 12:53:07,180
That was fucking crazy.

9399
12:53:08,280 --> 12:53:09,080
That weekend.

9400
12:53:09,560 --> 12:53:11,200
Like, that was wild.

9401
12:53:13,100 --> 12:53:14,620
Do we have...

9402
12:53:14,620 --> 12:53:18,020
I think the highest rate was two games where we had two
people...

9403
12:53:18,020 --> 12:53:19,820
Two games where people were...

9404
12:53:19,820 --> 12:53:21,680
Out of not talking or were nice to each other.

9405
12:53:21,840 --> 12:53:23,140
And that was...

9406
12:53:23,140 --> 12:53:24,300
