00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,870
I'm restarting the server.

15
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,650
I'm the leaker.

16
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,850
It's me.

17
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,970
It's me.

18
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,170
I was the leaker all along.

19
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,130
All right.

20
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,770
I am restarting the server now and I shall post the new
password.

21
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,650
That is my bad.

22
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,010
That is, that is my.

23
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,410
Look, I was going through a lot, okay?

24
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:48,690
I was trying to figure out like I forgot to download the
game and it's not looking so great guys The reason why is

25
00:03:48,690 --> 00:04:01,330
that it's still at 1% I've been having this game downloading
for since like Since 445 and usually it's like super fast.

26
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:08,450
It's super fast because I have fiber But for some reason
it's still at 1% so I'm a little worried.

27
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,230
Okay, let me Hello, everyone.

28
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,570
Hey, guys.

29
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:23,730
I did a little oopsie and accidentally leaked the server.

30
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,810
But don't worry.

31
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,030
I changed the password.

32
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,150
It is now.

33
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,590
You guys are going to love the new password.

34
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,890

42
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,700
No, no.

43
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,380
I did more than just add a number.

44
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,240
I did a lot more.

45
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,560
Yes.

46
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,140
For those who are like, for the non-member goons who are
like, what's the new password?

47
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,860
Guess you gotta be a member to find out what the new
password.

48
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:57,320
where it is whoa it's a huge change it really is yeah yeah I
am very good at cyber security I'm really good at it yeah

49
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:14,790
actually leak the server on the on the public stream for one
for like two seconds but don't worry don't worry i hope i

50
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:25,150
hope all you member goons feel so safe now with my top of
the line cyber security skills yeah i should be part of the

51
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:33,010
cyber police or something uh no leaks also don't keep
self-snitches leave a super chat thank you thank you

52
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:44,190
pampered new year new you no more leaks starting now yeah
now there's no more leaks guys 2026 is a great time for me

53
00:06:44,190 --> 00:07:03,710
right now um anyway so i am a little worried about this game
not down it seemed like really slow today i just can anyone

54
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:14,070
like just give it to me straight like is steam downloads
really slow today or is it just me is it because like maybe

55
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:21,430
i don't know if it's the game maybe it's the game it could
just be the game because like i know i remember um yeah i

56
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:28,750
was like there's no way it could take i gave it like 15
minutes it's still at 1 because i know like some games take

57
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:38,710
like a really long time to download or update depending on
like um what the server is from um and basically like i

58
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:44,990
remember because every time in the in the past when we did
apex updates It would take like several hours some like at

59
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:51,370
one point an apex update could take like two to three hours
to fully update Even with fiber because the the server it's

60
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,810
drawing it from is like super slow You try restarting.

61
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,990
I think it might be the game itself.

62
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,570
I mean it's like I needed like an hour or some shit Okay, I
can pause and unpause.

63
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,790
Let me that would help I'm gonna try.

64
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:11,990
Oh, oh it went to two percent guys But like um, it's going
back down

65
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,420
Guys, it went to 2%.

66
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,980
Oh my god.

67
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,780
That's crazy.

68
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,600
That's lucky.

69
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,420
Oh my god.

70
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,180
Wait, wait.

71
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,600
It went to 8%.

72
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,880
Okay, I think I had to pause and unpause.

73
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,020
Oh my god, that's all I had to do.

74
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,420
Guys, I just had to pause and unpause.

75
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,260
Okay, while I think we're good now, I think we're good.

76
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,360
I just, I just like, have you tried to be starting?

77
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:51,200
it and it for for once it actually worked all right story
time i talked about the story on members i was gonna like

78
00:08:51,200 --> 00:09:01,180
say it here um so i don't know this person's watching but if
you are this is a little um this is a little wake-up call

79
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:08,300
for this person so for the last week remember goons know
this story because i already told the story uh but for the

80
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:19,360
last week i have been receiving um emails from this one
person that's been trying to like get in touch with this

81
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,120
fucking random vtuber who I've never met before, who I've
never communicated with before.

82
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,100
But apparently this vtuber follows me, but like I've never
like interacted with this vtuber before.

83
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,600
But anyway, I've been getting these emails and it's so
fucking weird.

84
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:46,080
And like this email is like, oh hey, thanks for inviting me
to your Christmas karaoke party I enjoyed your singing and

85
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:54,040
they're like anyway could you please let insert vtuber here
that would love to buy her lunch sometime and talk and then

86
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:04,920
they proceeded to give me their number and then their work
email and was like Merry Christmas and I was like what the

87
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:16,200
fuck and they also dox themselves to me like they gave all
their personal information to hoping that I will help pass

88
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:28,620
this down to this other VTuber who I've never like had any
sort of connection with before and and I thought that was

89
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:34,360
the end of the story and I was gonna tell this story earlier
because I thought it was the fucking weirdest email I like

90
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:41,640
ever like uh for uh this last month I thought last month
that was the weirdest fucking email I've got so far like

91
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,140
I've got a This is my weird email of the month.

92
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,260
But I forgot about it because a lot of other stuff was going
on.

93
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,000
So then I was like, all right, whatever.

94
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,160
I won't tell about this story.

95
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,420
It's just like a one-off thing.

96
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:09,940
And then the next week, the next week, I've been receiving
more and more emails from this random guy asking me to like

97
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,880
give, like asking me to pass his number.

98
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:22,960
to this VTuber because like I think I've received in total
um let me check in total one two three four emails from this

99
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:30,940
guy in the last week and each time he's like this is this is
the second email guy hey dokey can you tell insert VTuber

100
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:40,200
here to text me this is my number and then the third email
hey can you ask her to get a gym membership at this specific

101
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:49,900
insert gym name here because we're work out together and
then email number four he sent a video of himself

102
00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:07,310
he sent a video of himself like i literally see the
thumbnail of this guy's face and i was like holy fuck i was

103
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:19,330
like full on face reveal um and assume i didn't click the
video by the way very close to I was so curious because I

104
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:27,190
really wanted to know like what is he gonna say but then I
asked I told my manager I was like what the fuck is up with

105
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:37,550
this guy and then and then like um and then my manager's
like don't click on it it's like don't you dare click on it

106
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:47,250
don't get like it can be a virus don't do it I was just like
oh but like I was like I'm pretty sure it's virus but he's

107
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:54,430
like yeah but like we have to be sick we don't know what
he's gonna do we don't we don't know what he has like what

108
00:12:54,430 --> 00:13:01,930
he's capable of and then i was like but i really want to
click on it and then he and then my manager deleted all the

109
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:08,930
emails like he put it in the trash luckily even though it's
like he put in a trash i can still see the emails because

110
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:15,490
they did we didn't fully empty the trash can so i still have
the records of it for now until it's gone for the like

111
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:24,950
amount of days and it's gonna be fully white um so i was
just like i was just like what the fuck like i'm so tempted

112
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:30,090
to click on i really want to know what he said anyway some
of you were like blocked the emails but i was just curious

113
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:38,130
what he's gonna say next you know because like i wasn't the
main target for this guy i i was telling my members i was

114
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:47,490
pretty sure this guy has already been blocked by the vtuber
and like all her friends because like why the fuck is he

115
00:13:47,490 --> 00:14:02,370
contacting me like why is he reaching out to me if like
someone who has zero association and doesn't even follow

116
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:10,550
insert vtuber here as like and i was like oh just because
i'm a vtuber i just happen to know all vtubers bro Bro,

117
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,150
that's like, he racist, man.

118
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:22,090
I was like, at that point, he's just shooting random shots
to see who actually knows it.

119
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:32,650
Like, like, maybe, oh, just because I'm a V-tuber, I just
happen to know this fucking random person that I've never

120
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,210
talked to before or even follow.

121
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,770
Damn, V-tuber profiling.

122
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,430
Stay away.

123
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,230
Stay away.

124
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,990
So anyway, I've had to publicly shame this guy.

125
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,230
Like, this is your wake-up call, bro.

126
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,530
This girl is most definitely not interested.

127
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,150
And most likely, have you blocked?

128
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,090
I have not had you blocked yet.

129
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,510
Because at that point, I just wanted to know what you're
going to say next.

130
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,070
But, bro, please, move on.

131
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,270
You have to move on.

132
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:25,110
most likely her and her entire like friend friend group has
blocked you if you are contacting me to try and get a hold

133
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:34,650
of her that means you've ran out of options to figure out
how to get a hold of her like oh yeah it actually downloaded

134
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:43,070
thank god so like i hope me and i don't know if you're
watching this but i hope me and the dragoons have given you

135
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:55,970
the wake up call and to realize that you gotta stop bro it
is very creepy like i am doing you a favor in publicly

136
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:07,510
calling you out right now because this is the only way it'll
get you the help you need to realize to stop doing this like

137
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:19,270
like please i leave her alone I don't even know who she is,
but like, if you are giving, and please do not give your

138
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:30,070
personal information to random virtual people, because bro,
I don't know, I could use your number and like fucking spoof

139
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:30,490
it.

140
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,410
I don't know.

141
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:37,990
Like, your parents were right about stranger danger.

142
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,870
What if I was

143
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:54,470
never put your personal information on the internet you have
a digital roadmap right now it's no longer a footprint like

144
00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:05,970
you've like you've exposed your entire life to me by giving
me your fucking work email personal email first and last

145
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:16,490
name a video of you and also your phone number So please,
bro, I assume you did this.

146
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,650
You sent this email to a lot of people.

147
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,970
But, bro, please, you have to wake up.

148
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,090
She is not interested.

149
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,810
I have already enough on my plan, bro.

150
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:34,790
I cannot help you out because this is something that cannot
be helped.

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,030
You have to help yourself, bro.

152
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,510

If he does send another email, I'll give you guys another
update.

157
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,910
Because I don't know if he's still here.

158
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,430
Yeah, so anyway, I just wanted to talk about that.

159
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,470
I know some people are like, why are you enabling this?

160
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,110
Why are you like giving this guy attention?

161
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,370
This is the only way he will stop, guys.

162
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:43,470
This is actually like, if you don't call these people out,
they will not stop.

163
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:50,190
I know like this particularly is not even directed at me
like this is an intervention like I'm literally giving this

164
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:56,530
guy intervention right now because like I'm very like
unrelated to where the fuck he's like trying to get a hold

165
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:02,850
of and the fact that he's sending this random email to me
five different times on someone that doesn't even know who

166
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:16,190
the fuck he's talking to like I I'm just trying like this is
an intervention anyway anyway getting my spinach down

167
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:35,280
loading yay so as you guys might see from the title um it is
different from what the schedule is because um the reason

168
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,780
why is that i wanted to play the empress game but apparently
a lot of dragoons uh when i made the community post about

169
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:50,620
the empress game um people were saying um yeah imagine using
a real name on the internet absolute cringe i know jordan

170
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,720
wait is that also a photo of you right now let me look at
you

171
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:06,920
jordan jordan has salad you even have a oh wait your entire
your youtube videos are all pictures of you it's okay as

172
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,920
long as you don't have your personal number out there you're
fine jordan

173
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,080
It's okay.

174
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,120
At least you didn't dox your personal phone number at least.

175
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:24,920
It's okay.

176
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:31,080
You only did two out of four steps that the... I almost
doxed this guy out of the other guy's name.

177
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,740
Two out of the four steps that the other guy did.

178
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,020
Two out of four.

179
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,880
That's all right.

180
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,360
As long as not four out of four.

181
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,580
But yeah, so I wanted to do the Empress game, but a lot of
Dragoons and Community Post were telling me not to.

182
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:50,520
because apparently i think neemie did that did a stream of
the empress game and then she got struck down by youtube in

183
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:57,720
the middle of her stream because they thought that she was
watching a movie illegally even though it is a film motion

184
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,040
video game so it's basically like choose your own adventure
with like actors and stuff so they saw the game and thought

185
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:09,860
it she was watching a movie and her stream got taken down
halfway so like midway or some shit and she got like a

186
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:17,540
strike from it of that, I had to pivot to another film
motion video game.

187
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:26,220
So, you know, I took my gamble, you know, I was just like,
oh, she got struck down by playing a video game that looked

188
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,800
like a movie.

189
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,460
Let me play another video game that also is a movie video
game.

190
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,260
So, maybe it'll be different, but the title does have game
in it.

191
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:50,800
So, maybe because the title has game in it, a video game so
so maybe the maybe i'm i'm risking the gamba we're gonna

192
00:21:50,800 --> 00:22:00,760
find out now um very yeah let's hope i win the 50 50 and
hope my stream stays up um so i'm gonna play the 50 50 and

193
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:07,920
hope that even though it is also a film motion video game
that i will still be able to to stream it

194
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,020
Gamba.

195
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,780
We always love the Gamba.

196
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,180
Alright, let's boot it up, guys.

197
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,580
I don't know.

198
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,420
Also, Sound guy alive today.

199
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,340
Any of the sound guys?

200
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:29,820
Alright.

201
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:30,940
So, oh yeah.

202
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,420
Context for this game.

203
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,860
It's basically a parody of Squid Game from what I was told.

204
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,300
And some of the acting is really, really bad.

205
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,060
So it could be...

206
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,060
So I was thinking, oh, it's like a bad movie.

207
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,760
Watch Align.

208
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:48,800
I feel like a lot of film-motion video games are like really
terrible acting in general because like all these actors are

209
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:57,880
like super underpaid and stuff i will not be surprised yeah
so it's actually a parody of squid games so there's actual

210
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:05,420
like squid games games in there where i think i was looking
at like i was reading the reviews and like i'm not i'll tell

211
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:12,860
you okay it's actually pretty funny literally one of the
parody games is called um let me see i need to find it it

212
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,460
was they were listing out the mini games and stuff And I was
like, what the fuck?

213
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,380
Oh yeah, it's called Sugar Art Challenge.

214
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,860
Draw intricate patterns with chocolate sauce.

215
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,340
So that's basically, that's like the, the longa.

216
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,220
What was it called?

217
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,640
The longa thing where you're poking the, the, the sugar
cookie.

218
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,320
But it's like, oh, you gotta draw patterns with chocolate
sauce.

219
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,340
I assume that's like, because it's the Joker's game.

220
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,860
But like squid, the squid.

221
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,700
Squid game.

222
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,300
All right, here we go.

223
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,160
So these are our fellow squids.

224
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,440
Sorry, the fellow jokers.

225
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,700
What is this?

226
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,400
I assume these are like achievements.

227
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,080
Clown.

228
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:56,660
Ooh.

229
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:57,700
All right.

230
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,460
Whoa.

231
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,560
Like, I know what you did last summer.

232
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:07,970
All right.

233
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:08,690
Oh.

234
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,100
What's happening?

235
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,680
That dream again.

236
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,600
Oh, that was a dream.

237
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,040
Oh, hey, pretty lady.

238
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,700
Honey, bad dream again.

239
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,880
Ain't so bad with you by my side.

240
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,100
Oh, shit, I got an item.

241
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,880
I shook my head, unwilling to mention that dream.

242
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,630
My belly button.

243
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,670
What's the story behind this?

244
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,450
Okay, that, yeah, the acting's pretty bad.

245
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,010
I'm like, what do you...

246
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,570
Now you ask me about the ring, how long have we been dating
for her?

247
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,040
Roll over and claim dominance.

248
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,560
What?

249
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,360
Oh my god.

250
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,890
Nice.

251
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,990
A lovely night.

252
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,190
It would tell us.

253
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:35,830
Whoa.

254
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,990
Oh my god.

255
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,510
Right off the bat.

256
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,470
I mean, the second option is ignore her.

257
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,250
I mean, God's gotta do what a God's gotta do.

258
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,380
I kissed.

259
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,640
Oh, that's it.

260
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,460
Nice.

261
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,180
Oh, that's all I did.

262
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,120
That's how I claimed diamonds.

263
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:00,940
I just...

264
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,860
I just kissed it.

265
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,260
Remember, kiss your ladies to claim to be the alpha.

266
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,320
Are you winning, son?

267
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,740

I have music and sound effects.

I could turn music.

311
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,790
Do you think the music is linked to the sound, to the
dialogue?

312
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,290
Wait, we'll test it here.

313
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,790
I want to see if the music is linked to it.

314
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,070
Wait.

315
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:06,270
Wait a minute.

00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,150
It's not even that music.

317
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:11,050
Wait, I think sound effects is everything.

318
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,330

321
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,550

324
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:36,890
I read the reviews and the number one complaint was that
this game has very bad audio balancing.

325
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,210
So good luck.

326
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,930

00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:11,050

336
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,390

Guys, on my side.

511
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:30,420
In a game design standpoint, you must keep the cards
concealed.

512
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,180
In a game design standpoint, don't worry, everyone.

513
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,100
I'm a game designer.

514
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,460
It's like a video game, guys.

515
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,240
This is just like my video games.

516
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,320

eliminated.

520
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,180
Let's start the timer.

00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:29,740

How much longer are we gonna milk it for?

534
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,120
Could this be an off-the-grid criminal group?

535
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,920
How are they really tied to the conrad?

536
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,080

644
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:31,190
starting with j related to the jocular games nightfalls and
your in a deadly game where nothing is certain the more you

645
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:37,930
know about others the better your chances of survival but
among these players who can you trust who is hiding

646
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:45,590
something and what other twisted rules are waiting to be
revealed i wish the sound balancing of this game is a bit

647
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:48,570
better because this game already is a 10 out of 10 for me

648
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:56,950
this game is a 10 out of 10.

649
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:03,490
It is amazing.

650
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:11,970
Are those Roche chocolates?

651
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:14,590
Or like, is that how you pronounce it?

652
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:16,470
The fucking nutty chocolate?

653
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:26,220
Just thinking about how I went through the corpse makes me
sick.

654
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,900
I already lost my appetite.

655
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,500
There's no way I can eat anything now.

656
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,620
Can we have the jazz piano?

657
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,720
Can we have the jazz music louder, please?

658
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,840
I could almost hear them talk.

659
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:53,710
What is this?

660
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:57,970
I got 100 grand?

661
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:01,050
Okay, I can actually leave now.

662
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:01,430
You

663
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,500
guys see that?

664
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:09,040
It's true.

665
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,080
I'm rich now.

666
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,000
All I do is win, win, win the matter what?

667
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,260
Got money on my mind and I can't ever get it.

668
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:21,830
There's a billion dollars on the line.

669
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:26,690
Wait, I think he's a parody of that rapper guy in the Squid
Games.

670
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:27,770
So you're a rapper.

671
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,540
Game designer

672
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:43,180
Yeah, he's like Thanos What's your name?

673
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:47,060
What's up with me to be the champion?

674
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:53,960
A beauty like you deserve to be protected by someone strong
Like me And what if you lose?

675
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,520
Why don't we discuss how we're gonna win later tonight?

676
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:05,240
You better watch yourself, Smith an eye on everything you
know how brutal they can be better hope we don't have a face

677
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:10,560

678
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:15,510

679
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:20,270

680
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:31,130
why you have my protection my queen this looks like yours
you've got nothing to worry about

681
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:52,410
Oh Oh, I can ask her more About your drug habit.

682
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:54,550
Why did you stop acting?

683
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:55,290
Sure.

684
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:56,890
I'm a big fan of your movies miss.

685
01:01:57,210 --> 01:02:06,290
Oh, she's an actress What made you quit acting I was the
biggest star, you know But there just weren't enough, right?

686
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:13,810
Okay, it's very hard to tell she was an actress right now,
because that ain't she ain't selling it for me So the rumor

687
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:21,050
about Sophia's letter being a secret hunter is actually true
I think that he was a big shot That's crazy that they gave

688
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:25,550
her actress as like her job Because she was caught up in it

689
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:35,070
Alright, oh now I like Talk shit The drug thing?

690
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:36,630
That's just a rumor, right?

691
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:40,890
I wouldn't be here if they weren't true.

692
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:42,870
There's no point of hiding it.

693
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:46,990
But I promise you, I'll find my way back to the top.

694
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,510
Just sit tight and watch.

695
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:56,330
I wish the piano was even louder.

696
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:58,790
I can hear her, and I don't like that.

697
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:02,950
The music should be, like, at 300%.

698
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:03,150
Yeah.

699
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:05,910

peter ages ago exactly you see he's my idol he was designing

disappeared oh no way to be seen but i found this mysterious

702
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:32,350

can't hear us

706
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:05,930
the dark web

707
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:23,150
Surprises make people happy You should feel lucky to see a
great magician like me perform I feel so honest Your tricks

708
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:25,730

709
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:35,270
She made the card disappear Maybe you should be performing
in a theater Not here Well, if my partner hadn't died I

710
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:43,630

grand prize I'm gonna rebuild my theater and I'm going to be

711
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,590
the greatest magician in history.

712
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:53,410
Kid, before you become the greatest magician in history,
better make sure you don't starve yourself in the next

713
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:53,730
round.

714
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:54,690
Okay, I got it.

715
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:55,250
I'm curious.

716
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:02,580
Okay.

717
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,240
Music, it's all a lie.

718
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,560
It's all...

719
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,460
The jazz does not stop.

720
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:14,940
Don't mess with her.

721
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,020
What the fuck?

722
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,160
We missed what the scene was missing.

723
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,560
And I asked around some more.

724
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,220
I could get some new leads this way.

725
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:36,920
The Jax will never stop.

726
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:41,720
Alright.

727
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:42,960

We'll talk to him.

729
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,040
I'm curious about his life.

730
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:46,660
Your age doesn't.

731
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:54,800
give you an advantage in a game like this you know on the
contrary it does i will miss this entire game for a

732
01:05:54,800 --> 01:06:05,740
chocolate bar you're just a drifter to win it all in the end
you're gonna need some real skills what makes you think i

733
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:18,940
don't have any some guys catacombs and stomping at the point
you're sake dead dead the jazz make the sound balancing ties

735
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:38,900

this game is four hours long i have no idea how this game is

736
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:43,660
four hours I feel like I'm already at 50% of the gameplay

737
01:06:48,260 --> 01:07:00,120
Four If he's still alive finding him might lead to some more
clues It could be like four hours for all the endings guys

738
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:11,180
maybe if we're lucky is just all the endings Maybe it's just
two hours I can't tell who is still I'm up.

739
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:13,400
No, you're gonna miss out.

740
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,200
Don't you want to know where Peter is?

741
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,560
You gotta stay and find out who Peter is.

742
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:26,040
Yeah, four hours for the true ending.

743
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:28,240
I can't quite tell what you do for a living.

744
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:29,430
Could you tell me?

745
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:37,200
Oh, a housewife is a job, though.

746
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,580
What's gonna happen to them?

747
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:43,770
I don't have to go.

748
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:48,690
I mean, wait, if you don't have a job and you're single, are
you trying to say you're a single mom?

749
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:50,170
Do you not have a dad?

750
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:51,230
Do you not have a husband?

751
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:56,990
Oh.

752
01:07:57,730 --> 01:08:00,450
I'll stop the volume a bit.

753
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:10,140
Oh, so she wants the money to get out of the abusive
relationship.

754
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:12,040
At any cost, huh?

755
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,980
I saw you trying to pocket that fork earlier.

756
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:30,870

people to talk to you

adult the coming of age ritual in our village was horrible i

758
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:56,500
was hoping to earn enough money to escape an arranged
marriage that my father But it's even worse here if I had

759
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:00,380
had a known that accepting the out invite would have led me
here I never would have done it.

760
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:01,500
Oh my god, girl.

Sure, I'll protect all the women.

763
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:09,600
Maybe assuming I'm not dead

764
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:13,820
You're kind of skinny

765
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:18,900
It's the credit of my family

766
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,380
I was hoping if I could make enough money

767
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:37,170
Boy, you're just fucking skinny, girl.

768
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:44,610
You think I'm in, guys?

769
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:48,010
Guys, you think she liked that compliment?

770
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:54,650
You know, that technique where you compliment a girl, you
insult her and then compliment her later?

771
01:09:55,970 --> 01:09:56,750
I'm just a mechanic.

772
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:57,970
Gotta stay in shape for the job.

773
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:08,410
by how sharp he is in the game there's definitely more to
him than just being a mechanic your necklace looks unique

774
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:17,810
yeah i'm just nagging her guys it's it works guys ain't
nothing serious looks like a signature piece for the

779
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:04,970
They got the Roshan chocolates!

780
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:06,790
Hold down and slide.

781
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:08,350
Oh, I follow her.

782
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:09,890
Quick time event.

783
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:20,950
I recognize those chocolates anywhere.

784
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
There's two bros being next to each other.

785
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:37,250
Would you like to...

786
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:40,690
Can psychologists really read my...

787
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:41,850
My...

788
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:45,170
Bro, how fucking stupid am I?

789
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:48,610
I think all psychologists are fucking got telepathy.

790
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:50,410
Alright, we gotta team up with me.

791
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:51,950
Want to team up for the next rounds?

792
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:56,010
Depends on what information you can offer me.

793
01:11:57,170 --> 01:12:00,510
If you have knowledge on the game or the other players...

794
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:02,350
They need to bump fists at the urinal.

795
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:03,370
They give you a few tips.

796
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:07,010
But I don't make friends so easily.

797
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:08,190
Oh.

798
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:09,970
Trust is dangerous in this game.

799
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:11,710
How do you know?

800
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,570
So what brings you here?

801
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:16,990
Psychology pays well.

802
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:20,030
Why risk your life for extra money at a place like this?

803
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:24,150
For love?

804
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:27,130
What all went sideways?

805
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:28,430
Sideways.

806
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:29,630
Huh?

807
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:34,070
She never told me that she was a mom boss as well.

808
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:35,990
Wow.

809
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:40,170
You also dated a stripper too like me?

810
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:42,650
Same z's.

811
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:45,090
Can psychologists really read my mind?

812
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:47,230
So can psychologists really read minds?

813
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:49,830
Not exactly.

814
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:56,590
But I can tell who will be a good friend, and who will be a
future enemy.

815
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:58,290
Where do I fall?

816
01:12:58,370 --> 01:12:59,910
Yeah, where do I, where am I at?

817
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:02,770
I think it would be best to not become my enemy.

818
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:06,170
I've done a lot of work for the Conrad family, after all.

819
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:10,050
Sounds like he knows something valuable.

820
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,730
Hope he doesn't bite the dust, too.

821
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:13,130
soon.

822
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:14,650
Ooh.

823
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:22,590
I could consider an alliance and give you more intel, but I
need to know more about the Conrad family.

824
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:27,830
You're no friend of the Conrad's, that much is clear.

825
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:32,270
Best advice I could give you is to stay out of it.

826
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:35,570
Move their fingers in every pie in this country.

827
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:38,270
Play with fire, you get burned.

828
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:46,230
Ever thought maybe they put you here on purpose yeah i mean
you slept with the boss's wife they can't just let that

829
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:57,590
slide to them i'm nothing even if i did get out there's no
guarantee that i'd escape yeah let's just get him again

830
01:13:57,590 --> 01:14:05,170
they'll put you in the next game the next jungler game i
might as well take my chances here otherwise i could just

831
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:14,770
vanish like the others end up dead without anyone ever
knowing what happened You said you worked with the Conrad

832
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:24,070
family Who specifically Well, I even know Like who that
person is I'm like, who?

Thank you.

861
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:31,300
Um, that's not what death note taught me.

Um, I remember the interpol police Um, oh man, she actually
looks like that death note interpol police character before

863
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:47,000
she died and got a heart attack Get your mind out of the
gutter Get your mind out of the gutter

865
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:55,390
So what exactly do you do at the bank, John?

866
01:17:56,170 --> 01:18:03,330
Just a small time credit officer really my job pretty boring
most days i can watch a few youtube videos and whatnot but

867
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:09,550
if it wasn't for what happened with my partner i wouldn't
risk coming here we should just break up with her she

868
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:17,250
embezzled it's not like a tea oopsie tani mistake like
that's jail counted the players in the suits besides the

869
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:24,590
three discards i'd say every player has like three to five
cards getting more is gonna be pretty difficult he's indeed

870
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:32,410
a financial guy sharp with numbers could be a valuable asset
John watches Doki Bird, let's go.

871
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:33,750
Why do you trust me so much?

872
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:36,730
Oh man, the Jazz is back, guys.

873
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:39,050
We never leave Jazz.

874
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:49,950
I've gathered most of the details now, but I still don't
know how many cards each player is holding.

875
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:51,950
It says I can't escape right now.

876
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,270
I need a plan ahead for the upcoming matches.

877
01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:56,810
Looks like I could use a helping hand with this.

878
01:18:57,870 --> 01:19:00,570
Out of everyone here, I've identified three potential
allies.

879
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:08,510
trick could come in handy for this game a psychologist could
help me read everyone's thoughts and moods like what does he

880
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:17,670
i i don't think jack knows what a psychologist actually does
like i when you're at when you're getting therapy they ask

881
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:26,070
you how do you feel right now like they don't they don't
actually know how to read your mind like a profile they

882
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:28,550
could have spot the details i've Miss.

883
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:31,410
Guys, I think we're fucking stupid.

884
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,940
It's psychologist their psyche, right?

885
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:44,760
Now, which one should I pick?

886
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,320
Guys, I should pick the psychologist, guys.

887
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,700
He can read minds.

888
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,820
Okay, where the fuck did the magician come from?

889
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:10,680

896
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:52,340
you're a skilled magician i think you're my best bet in this
game i mean finding a partner for this game is definitely

897
01:22:52,340 --> 01:23:00,780
the right move but you know magicians are pretty picky about
their partners magicians are really careful huh well ever

898
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:08,560
since i was learning magic my dad always said a magician
needs to be quick on their feet i can't uh have a partner

899
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,220
She doesn't even want me.

900
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:13,960
Can't finish the game quickly.

901
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,400
Maybe we should just forget about it.

902
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:19,760
Bro, she rejected us.

903
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:20,980
Oh, wait, okay, we got...

01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:26,520
Okay, now complete the remaining tiles.

Okay, it's just be jeweled.

913
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:36,420

It's barely bejeweled.

926
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,140
It's not even bejeweled.

927
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:07,100
I'm just playing.

928
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:08,540

Alright, never mind.

934
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:49,940
It is a little bit more complicated than I expected.

935
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:53,220
Bum.

936
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:56,580

How?

939
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:05,360
Are you kidding me?

940
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,760
I can just move it.

941
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,060
Oh my.

942
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:10,420
Oh my god, it won't move.

943
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,740
How do you want me to move this?

944
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,320
Okay.

945
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,460
Okay, this changes everything.

946
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,760
Actually, wait, this...

947
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:28,040
What?

948
01:25:31,050 --> 01:25:32,810
Are you fucking kidding me?

949
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:34,490
Are you... Okay, it's okay.

950
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:35,030
It's okay.

951
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:37,270
It's okay.

952
01:25:40,530 --> 01:25:41,130
Alright.

953
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:43,250
Can I move that?

954
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:45,430
Okay.

955
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:47,210
Can't move that.

956
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:51,790
I got this out of the way.

957
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:55,030
I just gotta match it.

958
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,130
It's just gotta connect.

959
01:25:57,370 --> 01:26:00,210
But some of them you can move the entire fucking block.

960
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:01,030
Like this.

961
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:06,010
Like how come somebody can move the entire goddamn block and
then others I can't.

962
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:06,990
Like this.

963
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,460
I gotta get rid of the 10 here.

964
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:17,320
5.

965
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:21,280
Okay.

966
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:26,500
Like...

967
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:27,040
Okay.

968
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:29,660
Oh, we can get rid of the 9 at least.

969
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:30,600
And then the 8.

970
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,040
And then the 4.

971
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,120
And then the 2.

972
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,380
And then...

973
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:41,220
The queen.

974
01:26:50,910 --> 01:26:51,510
God, out!

975
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:52,810
Okay, it's fine.

976
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:00,560
How do I get out of this?

977
01:27:05,870 --> 01:27:06,710
Am I...

978
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:07,130
Stuck?

979
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:13,400
Oh, I can move the 10.

980
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:13,740
Okay.

981
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:15,000
I can move the 10.

982
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:16,200
That's good.

983
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:18,620
You can move the heart.

984
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,100
And then the 5.

985
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,480
7.

986
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:23,180
9.

987
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:24,360
Okay, there we go.

988
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:27,940
Sometimes I can move.

989
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:28,900
Sometimes I can.

990
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:29,680
Here's the scoop.

991
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,060
John has three cards.

992
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:33,980
His highest one is the queen of hearts.

993
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:35,140
How do you know?

994
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:36,440
I'm a magician.

995
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:37,920
David will leave it.

996
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,080
A magician never tells her secrets.

997
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:44,040
If he's telling the truth, then John isn't as genuine as I
can.

998
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:45,300
Oh,

999
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:50,700
oh, they can be all my friends.

1000
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:51,180
Okay.

1001
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:52,640
Oh, they'll just give okay.

1002
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:54,840
Choices don't matter.

1003
01:27:55,380 --> 01:28:01,820
Okay, let's go You have a point, but how can I be sure
you're the right partner for this?

1004
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,480
So you're looking to put me to the test.

1005
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:16,740
I'm playing around I'd be like I'll be your partner Who are
there is never free will in the jocular game It is usually

1006
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:21,440
at this precise moment that I can say if someone is
trustworthy or not

1007
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:31,660
So Jack How long will it take you to crack this puzzle?

1008
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:36,380
Oh My god, let's do a puzzle guys

1013
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:38,100
this one um another corner it's like here I had a feeling.

1014
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:42,770
It's either here or here.

1015
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:44,130
There you go.

1016
01:29:46,450 --> 01:29:47,010
That's the nose.

1017
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:48,270
I could tell.

1018
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:52,010
I'm just going off vibes right now.

1019
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:56,290
Is that the picture of the Johncler?

1020
01:29:56,470 --> 01:29:57,630
Oh my god, it's him.

1021
01:29:57,930 --> 01:29:59,130
It's John Johncler.

1022
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:03,390
It's gonna get me before I can save Shammu.

1023
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:12,310
Okay, that's the last corner.

1024
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:14,030
That should be here.

1025
01:30:14,370 --> 01:30:17,110
Okay, now I can just speedrun all the rest.

1026
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:25,350
It's like here.

1027
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:31,430
Wait, I can skip the puzzle.

1028
01:30:32,890 --> 01:30:34,490
Don't even have to do it.

1029
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:37,150
It's just the illusion of choice.

1030
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:39,690
I can't believe it.

1031
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:41,270
They're lucky I like doing puzzles.

1032
01:30:42,590 --> 01:30:45,770
I used to do puzzles all the time at my grandparents'
palace.

1033
01:30:48,010 --> 01:30:48,970
It's right here.

1034
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:49,530
It's Skipper.

1035
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:54,350
Actually skip up.

1036
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:00,760
Oh.

1037
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:02,580
Tabbed up.

1038
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:10,610
There you go.

1039
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:14,570
And done.

1040
01:31:14,990 --> 01:31:15,570
I was.

1041
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:23,970
What does that mean?

1042
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:27,900
Oh.

1043
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:28,460
Alright.

1044
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:30,580
I don't even know what...

1045
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:31,740
What is that intel?

1046
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:35,460
Honestly, I've always felt a bit uneasy around
psychologists.

1047
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,460
But it's skip, but I solved it.

1048
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:39,300
I don't read your mind.

1049
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:41,000
Not at all.

1050
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:42,540
I'm pretty open about myself.

1051
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:45,720
It's not a big deal if you see through me.

1052
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:47,820
But me, me, me, me, me, me.

1053
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:51,640
But, me, me, me, me, me, me, I'm a good choice.

1054
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:55,260
But I do have some expectations for my friends.

1055
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:57,600
Oh, like what?

1056
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:57,900
Mm-hmm.

1057
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:02,760
Psychologists can interpret anybody's thoughts based on
their actions.

1058
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:03,660
Huh?

1059
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,220
Remember that candy drawing game you play?

1060
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:08,480
played earlier yeah

1061
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:23,550
he's like round two oh my what the fuck okay that's not a
two

1062
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:31,270
oh my god okay that is not a cute

1063
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:38,550
all right

1064
01:32:42,210 --> 01:32:43,350
Here we go.

1065
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:49,310
Alright, where do we go now?

1066
01:32:50,610 --> 01:32:52,850
Oh my god, this is like the longest.

1067
01:32:53,430 --> 01:32:54,650
The longest trip.

1068
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:07,290
Alright, here we go.

1069
01:33:07,530 --> 01:33:08,230
We did it.

1070
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:09,780
Oh, we did it.

1071
01:33:12,690 --> 01:33:16,930
Based on my understanding of human behavior, I can give you
a little tip.

1072
01:33:18,290 --> 01:33:19,170
Be careful, Vanna.

1073
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:19,950
Huh?

1074
01:33:20,150 --> 01:33:20,590
And Ada.

1075
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:22,250
Why?

1076
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:32,790
that's it why but she works at interpol no oh my god look i
like how they took off the sticker they took off the sticker

1077
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:34,970
because they're not legally allowed

1078
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:51,210
oh what was the chocolate drug oh no never mind they just
took us to the ferrero chocolates my legally distinct

1079
01:33:51,210 --> 01:33:55,730
chocolates Game of the...

1080
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:56,930
I know, right?

1081
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:15,320
Oh.

1082
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:17,880
Hey, this looks like a servant scammer.

1083
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:19,720
Separate scam.

1084
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:23,140
What are you doing?

1085
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,520
I'm stuck on my last bit of code that Peter sent over.

1086
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,320
I just can't seem to understand it.

1087
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:33,800
Plus, the signal's bad, so a lot of my device functions are
down.

1088
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:36,220
Yeah, let's talk louder in front of the guards.

1089
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,320
Relic?

1090
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:38,240
Relic.

1091
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:40,540
Is it referring to the organizer of this game?

1092
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:43,220
This could be a key clue.

1093
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:45,000
I need to give it some thought.

1094
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:53,980
Am I thinking right now?

1095
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:55,420
Like, why did...

1096
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:57,540
Oh, okay, after John...

1097
01:34:57,540 --> 01:34:58,920
I was like, alright.

1098
01:34:59,500 --> 01:34:59,900
Silence.

1099
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:01,760
I am going to think now.

1100
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,920
I head back to my bunk.

1101
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:05,420
Thinking about...

1102
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:07,320
To what I heard at the restaurant.

1103
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,180
What's Rick hiding?

1104
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:09,200
I'll go talk to him.

1105
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:15,260
I got a feeling you're not just anybody.

1106
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:24,920
wasn't nominated but claire 33 was on you and they taught me
plenty exactly that's why i'm hoping we can team up it looks

1107
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:36,470
like nice wig like 10 years later you know what and sounds
like how way he sounds like it too doesn't sound like a fond

he taught me how to cheat at cards this trick could be

1113
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:38,910
useful later in the game the red light of the surveillance
camera is on constantly and the door is unlocked i'm gaming

1114
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:44,270
if i try to make a move the surveillance camera yeah this
was released like a week ago guys

Let me cook This decision Leave Just go out

1116
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:06,800
Surely it's not a Trap, right?

1117
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:21,460
You can just do that Just leave What could go wrong?

1118

Right side!

01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:51,110
Oh my god, he's so confused.

1127
01:38:51,310 --> 01:38:52,830
They have to hire better guards.

1128
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:59,350
If they are throwing out $1 billion left and right, I feel
like they might need to retrain their security team.

1129
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,360
This is why they gave this.

1130
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:07,080
What the fuck?

1131
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:08,040
Oh, did I make it?

1132
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:08,780
Oh, I made it.

1133
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:09,720
Okay, that was...

1134
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:11,220
The timer was so fast.

1135
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:12,740
I don't know if you guys saw that.

1136
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:14,600
That timer was crazy.

1137
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:28,300
Jesus Christ Scared the hell out of me Oh my gosh, she
scared me I can't believe you actually came Yeah I don't

1138
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:37,320

But I arrived I said suddenly checking out the place to see

1139
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:46,800
how far I could wonder And I warned And warned them to stay
inside because guys are patrolling everywhere outside.

1140
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:50,760
Guys, we're so in.

1141
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,260
I'm definitely saving the actress.

1142
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,560
How am I supposed to find out if Jason's even here then?

1143
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:58,600
Oh, my God.

1144
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,940
My fiancé, who I love very much.

1145
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:04,920
You want to go out there and search for someone?

1146
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,080
Don't tell me.

1147
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:10,860
You're going to go ask the diamond-shaped cards where he is.

1148
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:12,600
Are you?

1149
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:21,130
Maybe we should focus on getting through to the next round.

1150
01:40:22,210 --> 01:40:23,550
The two of us might be enough.

1151
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:26,550
Me and...

1152
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:27,290
Babe.

1153
01:40:27,870 --> 01:40:29,830
Don't underestimate a pretty woman.

1154
01:40:30,930 --> 01:40:33,250
I might just be your best partner here.

1155
01:40:34,030 --> 01:40:36,570
Because she called me babe, though.

1156
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:39,050
She called me babe.

1157
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,340
Oh my god.

1158
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:51,020
Oh, God.

1159
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:54,260
We're in a closet together.

1160
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,500
We're so in.

1161
01:40:56,780 --> 01:40:58,860
Oh, and she's locking the door.

1162
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:07,220
I can tell you're a strong man.

1163
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:08,220
Oh, me?

1164
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:09,840
Since you're willing to look out for me.

1165
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:10,500
Yeah?

1166
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:13,020
It's only fair if I give you something in return.

1167
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:16,620
A kiss?

1168
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:28,000

1177
01:42:53,090 --> 01:42:55,090
I just got back from next door and they died.

1178
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:57,010
Look, I'm sure it wasn't Jack.

1179
01:42:58,430 --> 01:42:59,130
Maybe it was someone else.

1180
01:43:00,270 --> 01:43:01,270
Let's search him and find out.

1181
01:43:01,610 --> 01:43:02,810
No one's laying a hand on him.

1182
01:43:03,450 --> 01:43:04,910
Or you'll have to deal with me.

1183
01:43:06,930 --> 01:43:08,190
That's right, she's from Interpol.

1184
01:43:08,450 --> 01:43:10,330
Rick was sleeping right next to Lucas.

1185
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:14,430
Jack, are you sure you didn't see anything when you came in?

1186
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:16,190
It was dark here.

1187
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:17,070
I couldn't see a thing.

1188
01:43:19,350 --> 01:43:28,910
kids there's no time to argue whoever stole the cards
they're also gonna have extra badges we should all have the

1189
01:43:28,910 --> 01:43:37,910
same amount of badges how about we put them out in the open
and whoever has the most I mean I could just not put out my

1190
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:46,830
badges yeah but yeah they don't know yeah it's hiding their
exactly that's not foolproof badge count won't decide who

road.

1195
01:44:17,690 --> 01:44:22,130
Alright, let me go steal something real quick while they're
fucking arguing on who sold the cards.

1196
01:44:22,930 --> 01:44:23,010

01:44:23,890 --> 01:44:24,730

Okay, what does she have?

1199
01:44:26,610 --> 01:44:27,170
Yoink.

1200
01:44:27,870 --> 01:44:29,610
My cards now.

1201
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:35,430
The magic temperature card found in Lucas might come in
handy.

1202
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:35,970
Free loot.

1203
01:44:36,990 --> 01:44:37,490
Free loot.

1204
01:44:39,570 --> 01:44:41,570
Oh, I grabbed from him his fucking belt.

1205
01:44:43,030 --> 01:44:44,870
It's like a nice switchblade.

1206
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:46,150
Bro, this guy's...

1207
01:44:46,850 --> 01:44:48,030
Yeah, okay.

1208
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:51,090
Okay, I don't think you're having to fucking switchblade.

1209
01:44:51,490 --> 01:44:53,350
Okay, I'm just out of the shank of motherfucker.

1210
01:44:57,890 --> 01:44:58,570
What is it?

1211
01:44:58,590 --> 01:44:59,290
Oh, it's gum.

1212
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:01,350
And found on Smith seems pretty.

1213
01:45:01,570 --> 01:45:02,810
How do they not see?

1214
01:45:02,930 --> 01:45:04,630
Like, this is in front of them.

1215
01:45:05,010 --> 01:45:06,270
I did not see it.

1216
01:45:06,510 --> 01:45:08,330
Nobody can see me.

1217
01:45:09,550 --> 01:45:10,550
Got some gum.

1218
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:14,430
The only door lock in this place is the closet.

1219
01:45:14,610 --> 01:45:18,290
What do they mean by the closet is a very dangerous place,
okay?

1220
01:45:18,330 --> 01:45:19,190
You must be working together.

1221
01:45:19,210 --> 01:45:21,750
And you're gang you up on me because I'm alone.

1222
01:45:22,170 --> 01:45:23,830
Marshal, thank you for the super chat, thank you.

1223
01:45:23,850 --> 01:45:24,590
I'm not gonna argue.

1224
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:26,990
Besides, I prefer arguing.

1225
01:45:26,990 --> 01:45:28,090
I am the master.

1226
01:45:29,050 --> 01:45:29,610
Whoa.

1227
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:33,010
I am the master thief.

1228
01:45:40,290 --> 01:45:41,210
Oh, goodbye.

1229
01:45:43,830 --> 01:45:46,330
He's like, he's pretty heavy, guys.

1230
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:53,950
Wait, what the fuck?

1231
01:45:54,270 --> 01:45:56,970
Wait, where's the eye holes?

1232
01:45:57,610 --> 01:45:59,470
Wait, wait, wait!

1233
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:06,440
I said

1234
01:46:09,630 --> 01:46:12,050
this is like a fucking penis nose.

1235
01:46:14,930 --> 01:46:17,050
Why does it look like that?

1236
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:27,260
What?

1237
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:48,110
Shabu by...

1238
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:50,930
The whale from Ocean Park?

1239
01:46:52,370 --> 01:46:53,230
From Seaworthand?

1240
01:46:54,490 --> 01:46:56,690
Yeah, we're always in our hearts.

1241
01:46:56,770 --> 01:46:57,330
Oh, no.

1242
01:46:57,970 --> 01:47:02,710
I'll remember a kingdom of Shamu and that I'm always a
warrior of Shamu.

1243
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:04,250
Oh my god!

1244
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:06,010
I love Seawood!

1245
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:08,590
Shamu, our god.

1246
01:47:10,570 --> 01:47:11,570
Free Willy.

1247
01:47:22,450 --> 01:47:25,470
I will free all the whales, daddy.

1248
01:47:26,030 --> 01:47:27,810
I will free all the whales.

1249
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:31,410
Every single one of them.

1250
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:32,590
Moo!

1251
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:36,170
There are demons!

1252
01:47:37,390 --> 01:47:39,190
Jack and my mother.

1253
01:47:40,210 --> 01:47:47,810
You must protect the honor of the soul and always fight for
each other.

1254
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:49,310
Get lost!

1255
01:47:49,350 --> 01:47:50,750
This is my territory though, brat!

1256
01:47:51,030 --> 01:47:51,570
What?

1257
01:47:51,850 --> 01:47:53,650
Where did he come from?

1258
01:47:54,910 --> 01:47:57,150
Who is this random kid?

1259
01:47:57,650 --> 01:47:57,790
What?

1260
01:48:00,010 --> 01:48:01,170
Grants everywhere.

1261
01:48:01,790 --> 01:48:02,170
I didn't get it.

1262
01:48:02,170 --> 01:48:15,070
very far what else do you want to know what did I get pulled
like a random surprise bully aside from being a bit anxious

1263
01:48:15,070 --> 01:48:18,330

1264
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:25,280

1265
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:31,640

You're beautiful.

1273
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:25,440
You're so beautiful.

1274
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:28,440
I think touching her face would be a lot worse.

1275
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:33,250
Hope we can stick together.

1276
01:49:34,350 --> 01:49:35,550
Guys, I'm in.

1277
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:37,070
Oh my god.

1278
01:49:38,770 --> 01:49:40,070
I had her at Nihao.

1279
01:49:41,290 --> 01:49:43,790
You said you read the files on Edward Conrad's
assassination.

1280
01:49:44,830 --> 01:49:45,850
Did you happen to see the name?

1281
01:49:46,050 --> 01:49:47,590
You're in part two.

1282
01:49:48,270 --> 01:49:49,370
Do you know about this case?

1283
01:49:50,190 --> 01:49:54,870
I do see the wife number two What's your deal with him?

1284
01:49:56,030 --> 01:50:04,650
Find out the truth And I'll tell you everything Then you
better hang in there I think we'll make a great team Yay The

1285
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:12,950
mysterious game just keep piling up So many Do Ling and I
have a chance to learn more secrets Lost in thought I

1286
01:50:12,950 --> 01:50:22,170
drifted into deep sleep Trying to look forward to tomorrow's
match A wonderful day has begun.

1287
01:50:23,010 --> 01:50:24,250
Good luck, everyone.

1288
01:50:29,610 --> 01:50:31,770
The game grows deadlier by the minute.

1289
01:50:32,270 --> 01:50:36,210
The remote in your hand holds power over life and death.

1290
01:50:36,690 --> 01:50:38,950
Yours and someone else's.

1291
01:50:39,210 --> 01:50:46,630
But in this twisted contest, where anyone really traded
away, and when does the nightmare finally end?

1292
01:50:48,950 --> 01:50:52,470
Did he hit the lap these two thoughts?

1293
01:50:55,410 --> 01:50:57,170

01:51:07,950 --> 01:51:09,470

01:51:18,570 --> 01:51:21,010

1305
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:42,970
a camera on the screen looks like it's gonna take some time
to figure out honestly this out this game it's too bad they

1306
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:51,530
released a game in December if they just waited one more
week Jesus how is he so close to the mic now Jack I'm here

powerful someone is in this game the bigger the target they

01:52:25,730 --> 01:52:28,650
become I'm a game designer!

1312

I'm a game designer!

1315
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:36,770
Let's just move to the side and check things out.

1316
01:52:37,930 --> 01:52:39,970
Why did you hate me?

1317
01:52:41,490 --> 01:52:42,950
But she's such a Karen.

1318
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:47,090
I think she just doesn't trust me.

1319
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:51,120
All right.

1320
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:53,600
Look at all these creepy fucking dolls.

1321
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:55,740
Wait a minute.

1322
01:52:56,780 --> 01:52:57,740
Looks a bit unusual.

1323
01:52:58,800 --> 01:52:59,420
Why?

1324
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:01,560
They all look unusual.

1325
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:07,100
Jesus Christ.

1326
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:09,820
This doll's fucking spooky.

1327
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:13,340
It's because I didn't pick her.

1328
01:53:15,860 --> 01:53:16,020
Oh!

1329
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:21,660
Rotate the modules to adjust the circuit, directing the
current from the power.

1330
01:53:21,820 --> 01:53:27,760
When all paths within all terminals are connected to the
current, when selected and not, it will appear in red.

1331
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:31,100
Rotate the modules to continue to adjust directing.

1332
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:31,640
Okay.

1333
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:35,980
Okay.

1334
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:42,940
There you go.

1335
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:43,460
Yay!

1336
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:44,640
Okay, that was easy.

1337
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:47,380
Alright, so I just have to do all of them.

1338
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:54,540
A very ordinarily cloth door doesn't seem to be related to
the remote control.

1339
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:56,100
Okay, so this one's normal.

1340
01:53:57,320 --> 01:53:57,840
Alright.

1341
01:53:58,540 --> 01:53:59,700
She's a normal, duh.

1342
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:01,820
He's like, okay.

1343
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:10,040
gotta make sure okay no okay although i would say this doll
is freaking freaky as hell this doll has her hand in a box

1344
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:11,820
so there must be something there

1345
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:26,820
okay never mind it was that doll the freaking freaky ass
doll over there oh i can continue right now oh i already

1346
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:34,780
found it i figured it out in the first try never mind i
don't know whose it is but it's a solid start it's just that

1347
01:54:34,780 --> 01:54:37,500
box Found a key.

1348
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:39,500
I don't know which room it's for, though.

1349
01:54:40,460 --> 01:54:41,520
Why not try the room next door?

1350
01:54:41,620 --> 01:54:42,980
I cooked a little too hard.

1351
01:54:43,140 --> 01:54:44,540
I thought too hard for that.

1352
01:54:50,610 --> 01:54:53,250
These Makus, you gonna take them from you?

1353
01:54:53,950 --> 01:54:54,850
A locked door?

1354
01:54:55,170 --> 01:54:56,270
I don't want to step on your toes or anything.

1355
01:54:56,930 --> 01:55:01,630
But before you go all Hulk mode on that door, why don't you
give the key a shot first?

1356
01:55:02,470 --> 01:55:04,370
Oh my god, we're working together!

1357
01:55:07,370 --> 01:55:09,450
Guys, we're gonna split the billion dollars.

1358
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:22,180
what he gave you the key and now you're not gonna let us in
all right i'll let y'all in but just make sure that if y'all

1359
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:30,160
find anything in here you don't even think about stashing
the way why are you still using your brain because it's a

1360
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:38,660
mystery also he has to lock let me in anyway There was no
way he could, like, lock me in.

1361
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:45,960
They found that they're actually headlamps and found...

1362
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:47,720
Oh, is that how it does the shock?

1363
01:55:47,860 --> 01:55:50,020
They just turned the headlamps on and off?

1364
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:53,780
Wait, how much is it, Vaisal?

1365
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:55,320
Thank you, the super chat.

1366
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,620
Thank you, thank you.

1367
01:55:57,220 --> 01:55:58,300
All right, what's the heart?

1368
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:00,500
I assume it's the bottom, right?

1369
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:02,980
Because that's the fucking module shit.

1370
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:11,580
They cost 13 euros.

1371
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:18,920
That's a little too expensive for how much I thought it was
going to be for like the budget of this production.

1372
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,040
Seems useless.

1373
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:27,740
This is the only thing that looked useful in the entire
selection.

1374
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:29,240
There's no way.

1375
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:30,460
These are just...

1376
01:56:30,460 --> 01:56:33,140
That's just water and food coloring.

1377
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:43,800
Oh my god, I'm going to drink it.

1378
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:44,740
Okay, I was going to say.

1379
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:46,480

Oh, no.

1390
01:59:10,290 --> 01:59:11,450
Give me a sec.

1391
01:59:12,530 --> 01:59:13,650
I'm thinking.

1392
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:17,870
Can I use the empty vials?

1393
01:59:18,250 --> 01:59:18,870
Oh, I can.

1394
01:59:19,070 --> 01:59:19,730
Okay, I can.

1395
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:21,430
Okay, I can use the empty vials.

1396
01:59:22,010 --> 01:59:23,190
Okay, this is fine.

1397
01:59:23,650 --> 01:59:25,650
I can actually use the empty vials.

1398
01:59:26,590 --> 01:59:27,270
Okay, there you go.

1399
01:59:27,650 --> 01:59:29,070
Okay, and then yellow.

1400
01:59:32,670 --> 01:59:33,790
And then...

1401
01:59:34,210 --> 01:59:55,020
for this and uh okay we're going to grab the purple from

Okay, and then...

1408

I'll grab the blue, though.

1409
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:25,340
Blue for here.

1410
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:28,560
And then we gotta pour this here.

1411
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:30,680
Pour another orange here.

1412
02:00:31,540 --> 02:00:33,800
Pour another blue here.

1413
02:00:34,620 --> 02:00:35,960
And then...

1414
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:36,500
Bam!

1415
02:00:37,100 --> 02:00:38,120
We did it!

1416
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:40,600
We're so smart.

1417
02:00:41,420 --> 02:00:43,380
We collected the key information.

1418
02:00:45,540 --> 02:00:48,160
The clue in Daniel's hands points this room full of jars.

1419
02:00:48,860 --> 02:00:49,640
No doubt about it.

1420
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,940
This room where control belongs to Daniel.

1421
02:00:56,700 --> 02:00:58,900
If he makes it to the end?

1422
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:01,720
Marshall, thank you for the super chat.

What do y'all have?

1428
02:01:08,940 --> 02:01:10,680
Pretend not to have found anything.

02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:12,040

1435
02:02:04,770 --> 02:02:06,770

Oh,

02:05:01,180 --> 02:05:01,940
there's no head.

1458
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:03,960
Oh, there's no purpose.

1459
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:06,880
And I just thought I connected to something.

1460
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:08,300
No head?

1461
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:11,700
Oh, it is.

1462
02:05:13,820 --> 02:05:16,240
Oh, maybe there's a box behind it.

1463
02:05:23,870 --> 02:05:24,470
All right.

1464
02:05:24,610 --> 02:05:25,730
Oh, my God, it's this.

1465
02:05:27,210 --> 02:05:27,370
them.

1466
02:05:27,590 --> 02:05:34,530
Click empty screws to place use the initial empty holes to
dismantle all victory's cheat when all planks disappear.

1467
02:05:35,050 --> 02:05:35,050
Okay.

1468
02:05:36,450 --> 02:05:37,090
Um.

1469
02:05:40,270 --> 02:05:40,990
There you go.

Okay.

02:05:45,730 --> 02:05:46,630
Oh, that's easy.

02:05:46,770 --> 02:05:48,310
Wait, I can just speed run this.

1475
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:53,000
There you go.

1476
02:05:53,580 --> 02:05:54,940
Now I put that here.

1477
02:05:55,540 --> 02:05:57,040
And then that's gone.

1478
02:05:58,900 --> 02:05:59,360
Oh, yeah.

1479
02:05:59,380 --> 02:06:00,240
This is so easy.

1480
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:00,980
This is a puzzle.

1481
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:01,940
for babies.

1482
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:04,380
Watch that.

1483
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:06,060
Oh.

1484
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:11,560
Then put that here.

1485
02:06:15,410 --> 02:06:16,390
And then

1486
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:20,320
boom.

1487
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:20,940
Boom.

1488
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:21,640
Boom.

1489
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:23,440
I fixed it.

1490
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:25,060
Yeah!

1491
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:29,280
A baby puzzle for a baby doll.

1492
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:37,700
Where the fuck did that tank come from?

1493
02:06:42,170 --> 02:06:43,010
Okay.

1494
02:06:43,830 --> 02:06:53,770
all right i opened it three guys i did it i opened it as i
tucked away the remote control numbers i turned it around

1495
02:06:53,770 --> 02:07:01,510
angry shouts erupt from the nearby music box room guess i
better check it out all right give it to me we're all gonna

1496
02:07:01,510 --> 02:07:13,850

they're totally lying they only said that because they saw

1497
02:07:13,850 --> 02:07:14,710
you had one

1498
02:07:18,090 --> 02:07:22,370
but don't listen to that nonsense That makes sense.

1499
02:07:22,730 --> 02:07:26,230
Ada, if you've really got mine, then you must know my
number, right?

1500
02:07:28,370 --> 02:07:31,370
Rick, I'm guessing you want your number four, right?

1501
02:07:33,290 --> 02:07:36,790
Oh, come on, you have to know Rick's totally playing you.

1502
02:07:37,350 --> 02:07:41,990
He just wants me to get back his number four remote control,
and he's trying to block you from giving me back my number

1503
02:07:41,990 --> 02:07:42,430
11.

1504
02:07:47,850 --> 02:07:49,630
Alita, is this what you're looking for?

1505
02:07:49,790 --> 02:07:51,410
Eight is mine.

1506
02:07:51,890 --> 02:07:53,250
Rick, she wasn't lying at all.

1507
02:07:53,250 --> 02:07:55,270
Oh, damn, he's a stupid girl.

1508
02:07:55,990 --> 02:07:56,990
He just tipped your hand.

1509
02:07:58,030 --> 02:07:59,470
We're done for it.

1510
02:07:59,810 --> 02:08:02,790
Why don't we all just give each other the remote?

1511
02:08:02,910 --> 02:08:05,690
Oh, because the more people that died and more money to get
right where.

1512
02:08:06,870 --> 02:08:08,590
Then we'll perish together.

1513
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:16,820
Hey, Jack, you don't want the number 911, do you?

1514
02:08:18,260 --> 02:08:22,580
Sorry, before I rolled in here, I already had a clue about
someone's number.

1515
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:30,180
and from what I heard I'm guessing this number three remote
control in my hand might actually be yours.

1516
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:31,260
Am I right, Sophia?

1517
02:08:31,820 --> 02:08:32,540
Oh, darling.

1518
02:08:32,980 --> 02:08:33,740
Oh, yeah!

1519
02:08:36,060 --> 02:08:36,580
Chill.

1520
02:08:37,740 --> 02:08:39,120
We need to sort this out.

1521
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:40,780
Nice week is evil?

1522
02:08:41,860 --> 02:08:43,740
You know how she left 100 thieves today?

1523
02:08:44,260 --> 02:08:46,240
He went and joined the jocular games.

1524
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:47,420
That's his big announcement.

1525
02:08:49,140 --> 02:09:00,520
But you and Lolita need to hand in Ada's and mine first and
then we could chill darling Jack don't listen you got

1526
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:07,620

1527
02:09:07,620 --> 02:09:20,440

fair way Jack okay I don't like him or her they've been

Okay, I'm listening to Rick.

1533
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:02,700
I'm listening to Rick.

1534
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,400
I'm not listening to the Karen.

1535
02:10:08,960 --> 02:10:10,500
Nah, she was a bitch.

1536
02:10:10,640 --> 02:10:12,260
She said I was stealing.

1537
02:10:16,160 --> 02:10:17,920
What the heck are you doing?

1538
02:10:19,420 --> 02:10:20,460
Well, don't forget.

1539
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:23,680
This is a game of I die, you die.

1540
02:10:24,180 --> 02:10:25,820
You gave me a kiss.

1541
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:27,200
I've got a better shot.

1542
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:28,900
Jack.

1543
02:10:29,580 --> 02:10:30,520
You're right now.

1544
02:10:32,700 --> 02:10:33,520
My guess is right.

1545
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:36,500
That destroyed number nine remote control should be honest.

1546
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:44,360
Sophia.

1547
02:10:44,900 --> 02:10:45,500
You bitch!

1548
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:48,380
My wives are fighting!

1549
02:10:50,020 --> 02:10:50,420
Whoa.

1550
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:52,180
Oh, sorry.

1551
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:53,260
Chill out.

1552
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:54,320
It's almost time.

1553
02:10:54,900 --> 02:10:55,900
This is no time to fight.

1554
02:10:56,740 --> 02:10:58,040
Did you find a remote control?

1555
02:10:58,540 --> 02:10:58,760
Nope.

1556
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:01,160
Had enough of this silly game.

1557
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:04,140
Just disgusting to be here.

1558
02:11:04,940 --> 02:11:07,180
Ladies, ladies, please!

1559
02:11:08,420 --> 02:11:09,960
Calm down, ladies!

1560
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:12,660
Oh no!

1561
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:13,780
Oh no!

1562
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:16,060
In the puppy room earlier.

1563
02:11:17,140 --> 02:11:17,200
Awesome!

1564
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:18,160
Oh yay!

1565
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:21,020
You gotta do what it takes to stay alive.

1566
02:11:21,660 --> 02:11:22,360
Check this out.

1567
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:24,320
Linda, he's got your number six.

1568
02:11:25,020 --> 02:11:25,200
Oh!

1569
02:11:25,540 --> 02:11:29,180
Before we swap, just a heads up.

1570
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:30,980
Don't be fooled by his appearance.

1571
02:11:32,160 --> 02:11:34,460
The Jack you think you know is how he wants you to see him.

1572
02:11:34,580 --> 02:11:34,880
What?

1573
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:38,200
Huh?

1574
02:11:39,620 --> 02:11:41,060
You can't ignore anybody in this game.

1575
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:46,000
You might be peaceful now, but you could easily be enemies
in the next round.

1576
02:11:48,060 --> 02:11:49,080
Why don't you take him out now?

1577
02:11:49,740 --> 02:11:50,780
Wait, no!

1578
02:11:51,940 --> 02:11:54,360
Wait, she said she wants to hang out after!

1579
02:11:54,780 --> 02:11:55,480
Come on, Lynn.

1580
02:11:56,060 --> 02:11:56,420
Lynn.

1581
02:11:56,560 --> 02:11:58,360
Jack could easily be more trustworthy than Leon.

1582
02:11:58,720 --> 02:12:00,580
Bro, that guy's a psychologist, bro.

1583
02:12:00,620 --> 02:12:01,640
You can't trust him.

1584
02:12:03,580 --> 02:12:04,340
Tough cookie.

1585
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:06,180
Six, seven,

1586
02:12:17,860 --> 02:12:22,540
six, six, six, six, seven, six,

1587
02:12:28,510 --> 02:12:30,310
seven, six, seven, we did it, guys.

1588
02:12:31,230 --> 02:12:32,030
Emergency alert.

1589
02:12:32,410 --> 02:12:35,630
The ace of hearts has been murdered and the murderer is
among you.

1590
02:12:35,910 --> 02:12:38,830
The result of this round of the death clock game is in
battle.

1591
02:12:38,830 --> 02:12:40,050
This is the girl's number four.

1592
02:12:41,590 --> 02:12:43,930
Was Dengon Rompadel?

1593
02:12:45,210 --> 02:12:47,010
Wait, how did he get murdered?

1594
02:12:50,870 --> 02:12:52,150
Excuse what?

1595
02:12:54,310 --> 02:12:58,650
Wait, how did he die?

1596
02:12:59,510 --> 02:13:01,690
How the fuck did he kill him?

1597
02:13:02,250 --> 02:13:03,370
We have nothing.

1598
02:13:03,950 --> 02:13:05,030
Did he leave something behind?

1599
02:13:07,110 --> 02:13:08,410
Oh, you left the glove.

1600
02:13:08,670 --> 02:13:10,530
Okay, I got the memory.

1601
02:13:10,550 --> 02:13:20,030
i'll grab the fucking sd the sd card real quick he died from
cringe he read the script

1602
02:13:23,950 --> 02:13:25,230
all right

1603
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:39,440
he saw too much where have you been why are you just showing
up right now yeah you can kill him did you i've been in the

1604
02:13:39,440 --> 02:13:47,760
security room my clue is the camera what's going on here
isn't it obvious someone killed the guard with a carving

1605
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:57,040
knife a carving knife where the fuck was the knife jack
isn't your clue the carving knife it can't be jack he was

1606
02:13:57,040 --> 02:14:05,240
with me the whole time wait she had my number in a box
flying with the remote control Anna and I grabbed it and we

1607
02:14:05,240 --> 02:14:11,660
left the room right Anna oh wait she's still alive let's go
to the security room how is Anna still alive

1608
02:14:16,240 --> 02:14:17,360
We kill the guard.

1609
02:14:18,080 --> 02:14:19,060
You can we just do that?

1610
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:21,620
If someone's about to die, we'll just kill the guard.

1611
02:14:26,240 --> 02:14:27,020
Oh, nice.

1612
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:33,780
I love my loopholes, yeah.

1613
02:14:35,260 --> 02:14:38,560
Yeah, because he was like, the round is invalid because a
guard is dead.

1614
02:14:45,290 --> 02:14:46,570
I know this is on a Mac.

1615
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:54,780
Does he just start shanking him?

1616
02:14:58,140 --> 02:15:01,800
Oh, he's like, uh, like this, uh, Royal Guards!

1617
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:04,920
The British Royal Guards.

1618
02:15:08,300 --> 02:15:10,140
Oh, whose shoes is that?

1619
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:11,460
Whose feet is that?

1620
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:14,740
Oh?

1621
02:15:15,620 --> 02:15:17,120
Why is he turning the camera?

1622
02:15:18,700 --> 02:15:21,260
Don't those eyes look familiar, would you hear?

1623
02:15:21,940 --> 02:15:24,400
Oh, that's Beyonce?

1624
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:25,400
Jason!

1625
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,540
No way.

1626
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:30,480
Do you think Jason has been killed?

1627
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:31,300
Oh!

1628
02:15:32,120 --> 02:15:35,080
So, who do you think killed him?

1629
02:15:35,740 --> 02:15:37,220
Honestly, I'm clueless.

1630
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:38,740
Who do you think it could be?

1631
02:15:39,140 --> 02:15:41,480
Well, I mean, we saw the shoes and pants.

1632
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:42,780
There's two guys on the screen.

1633
02:15:43,400 --> 02:15:44,320
One is George.

1634
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:47,320
And the other is like a little dude that's following him.

1635
02:15:47,680 --> 02:15:48,980
It must be one of them.

1636
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:50,580
Yeah, I know.

1637
02:15:50,780 --> 02:15:51,980
Just from the fucking ass.

1638
02:15:52,060 --> 02:15:52,800
You can tell you that.

1639
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:55,000
How does the rat...

1640
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:55,980
George was asleep the whole time.

1641
02:15:56,440 --> 02:15:57,160
It couldn't be him.

1642
02:15:57,220 --> 02:15:59,260
How does she recognize Jason?

1643
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:00,480
Telling the truth.

1644
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:02,120
You could be working together.

1645
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:03,380
Mm-hmm.

1646
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:07,340
And the person behind you is clearly not Lynn.

1647
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:13,800
Shut the fuck up, okay?

1648
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:19,220
Anna was the one behind me, and after I left, I have no idea
what she got up to.

1649
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:21,480
But she does look pretty suspicious.

1650
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:24,700
Wait, are you saying that Anna is the murderer?

1651
02:16:24,980 --> 02:16:25,460
No way.

1652
02:16:25,580 --> 02:16:26,180
There's no way!

1653
02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:27,280
That's her fiancé!

1654
02:16:27,760 --> 02:16:29,420
She couldn't have been killed.

1655
02:16:30,200 --> 02:16:31,020
Jason, right?

1656
02:16:32,740 --> 02:16:44,640
Jason who's Jason what are you guys hiding it's none of your
business okay um well it's everyone's business because

1657
02:16:44,640 --> 02:16:54,640
Jason's the one that's dead before that guard got killed I
mean Sophia I don't recall seeing you at all don't you even

1658
02:16:54,640 --> 02:17:04,480
think of blaming me okay I was with Ada the whole time it
all doesn't matter all Judging by the size of the dead

1659
02:17:04,480 --> 02:17:09,920
guard, it would have probably been very hard for a woman to
have done it.

1660
02:17:10,340 --> 02:17:10,480
Damn!

1661
02:17:11,360 --> 02:17:16,040
If it were me, personally, I would have run for the neck.

1662
02:17:16,460 --> 02:17:18,140
I would have killed him in a more brutal way.

1663
02:17:18,180 --> 02:17:18,600
It's kind of risky.

1664
02:17:19,440 --> 02:17:22,740
All in all, our killer was probably no professional.

1665
02:17:24,040 --> 02:17:26,480
So we're looking for a short man, you think.

1666
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:31,400
Judging by heights, then, that leaves only our wobbly elder,
Rick.

1667
02:17:32,340 --> 02:17:43,900
and john wait i'm taller no one yeah while we were all out
we were all came back in here and john was last to roll in i

1668
02:17:43,900 --> 02:17:51,260
was in the security room like my clue was here i don't even
kill spiders makes you think i could kill a person that

1669
02:17:51,260 --> 02:18:00,380
makes jack our prime wait what how is me is the carving
knife i was literally with lynn and you just perjured

1670
02:18:00,380 --> 02:18:15,540
yourself against okay we were together and also jack no wait
and john that is what it was me and lynn the act guy and the

1671
02:18:15,540 --> 02:18:28,560
computer guy this game i had four people with me all i know
is i saw leon coming out of the puppet room after anna and

1672
02:18:28,560 --> 02:18:31,940
lynn and i left you checked the body he's probably off that
guard with his carbon

1673
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:37,500
You guys don't understand this at all.

1674
02:18:38,740 --> 02:18:39,060
Doesn't matter.

1675
02:18:39,360 --> 02:18:42,880
Yeah, it was literally a woman's, like, shoes.

1676
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:44,040
And we'll all be safe.

1677
02:18:44,220 --> 02:18:45,140
I saw the shoes.

1678
02:18:45,360 --> 02:18:46,040
No, no, no, Leon.

1679
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:49,060
We're not voting innocent people out.

1680
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:52,160
Are we?

1681
02:18:52,280 --> 02:18:52,840
That's murder.

1682
02:18:54,300 --> 02:18:54,820
Who cares?

1683
02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:58,800
Isn't this game just about surviving, about the skin of your
teeth?

1684
02:18:59,700 --> 02:19:01,180
No one's going to stay innocent forever.

1685
02:19:01,360 --> 02:19:01,600
Hmm.

1686
02:19:02,300 --> 02:19:03,160
Laughed easy.

1687
02:19:03,220 --> 02:19:08,020
You know, you're spending a lot of time, Leon, trying to
find out who the killer is not.

1688
02:19:08,700 --> 02:19:11,080
Maybe you're the one pulling the strings behind the scenes,
eh?

1689
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:13,160
I agree with Len.

1690
02:19:13,440 --> 02:19:14,460
Time's running low.

1691
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:16,300
Let's find out who the real killer is.

1692
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:19,120
Having the killer hanging around could be dangerous.

1693
02:19:21,240 --> 02:19:21,720
I agree.

1694
02:19:22,660 --> 02:19:23,860
I'm sure some of us...

1695
02:19:23,860 --> 02:19:26,160
It's Amaga's time in the Junkler games.

1696
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:27,140
As to who it might be.

1697
02:19:28,780 --> 02:19:32,080
Jack, I don't think we have time to know who the real murder
is.

1698
02:19:32,100 --> 02:19:44,500
is if we don't find if we don't vote someone out like right
now we might all end up dead together I'm voting to caring

1699
02:19:44,500 --> 02:19:50,940
and I don't fucking care if she didn't do it I hate it I
don't like her

1700
02:19:54,030 --> 02:20:05,390
yeah what are you guys looking at me for what you still have
time to backtrack save your own skin join forces with me

1701
02:20:05,390 --> 02:20:17,970
against so okay but he has like three people that hate me
already for me i didn't do it jack now is not the time for

1702
02:20:17,970 --> 02:20:23,830
compassion only bloodletting okay but his team has all the
people that hate me

1703
02:20:34,580 --> 02:20:48,540
sorry about destroying your your remote anyway get away from
me i'm with the voice hey i really appreciate you trusting

1704
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:58,480
me to get that remote controller back i won't vote you out
but just remember people can flip quick so you better look

1705
02:20:58,480 --> 02:21:05,260
at saving your own skin rick thank you for the super chat
thank you thank you so good and so she saved the multiverse

1706
02:21:05,260 --> 02:21:13,980
let it be known everyone oh can't be trusted oh maybe i
should have given the remote we're gonna die here

1707
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:33,080
there's no way wait it's oh it's leon okay of course i'm
gonna vote for leon five four three two one the time track

1708
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:39,200
down the actual murder john's the only one without a solid
alibi his height and the crime time scene makes him the most

1709
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:45,600
likely suspect but he did save me he's one of few friends i
have here leon went to the puppet room too so he's a suspect

1710
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:47,760
But he's really good at rallying people up.

1711
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:52,300
I'm going to go with A because he's like the scarier
opponent there.

1712
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:56,900
I mean, B, if John's marinating me, then he's like the
ultimate villain.

1713
02:21:57,080 --> 02:22:01,020
But I think he deserves it if like he's trying to save his
girlfriend from embezzlement.

1714
02:22:01,740 --> 02:22:02,620
I understand, bro.

1715
02:22:02,980 --> 02:22:04,000
He wants to fix her.

1716
02:22:04,940 --> 02:22:06,640
Leon's ass lies might target me next.

1717
02:22:06,740 --> 02:22:07,520
What should I do?

1718
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:08,940
A.

1719
02:22:10,040 --> 02:22:11,140
I vote for Leon.

1720
02:22:13,940 --> 02:22:14,420
Okay.

1721
02:22:15,480 --> 02:22:15,580
Okay.

1722
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:23,440

1723
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:32,600

to die everyone's support looks like you picked the wrong

1725
02:22:50,450 --> 02:22:53,370
teammate Like what I said, kid.

1726
02:22:54,170 --> 02:22:55,590
It's tough to read people in this game.

1727
02:22:56,470 --> 02:22:57,030
For real.

1728
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:01,660
How could you?

1729
02:23:03,540 --> 02:23:04,140
No!

1730
02:23:11,300 --> 02:23:13,480
I should have given him the remote.

1731
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:15,180
I should have given it.

1732
02:23:15,500 --> 02:23:16,160
Good, awesome.

1733
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:16,860
Wait.

1734
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:20,680
Okay.

1735
02:23:22,800 --> 02:23:23,400
Okay.

1736
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:24,060
I have to.

1737
02:23:27,080 --> 02:23:28,660
If I vote John.

1738
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:31,440
No, he still lives.

1739
02:23:34,860 --> 02:23:35,220
Okay.

1740
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:38,140
We can salvage this.

1741
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:42,360
We can salv- Someone will die here.

1742
02:23:42,940 --> 02:23:43,240
Wait, no.

1743
02:23:43,340 --> 02:23:44,940
Someone will die here.

1744
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:49,460
Okay, wait, wait.

1745
02:23:49,500 --> 02:23:50,160
We can fix it.

1746
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:50,820
Let's try.

1747
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:52,180
Let's pick.

1748
02:23:52,540 --> 02:23:54,000
Oh, I just die automatically.

1749
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:54,800
I still die.

1750
02:23:55,120 --> 02:23:55,800
I still die.

1751
02:23:57,200 --> 02:23:58,220
It doesn't matter.

1752
02:23:59,500 --> 02:24:01,040
John, how could you?

1753
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:02,920
I still die.

1754
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:04,480
It doesn't matter.

1755
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:06,380
I can't unlock this.

1756
02:24:07,720 --> 02:24:08,220
Okay.

1757
02:24:08,700 --> 02:24:10,440
Alright, we gotta...

1758
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:11,040
Okay.

1759
02:24:11,980 --> 02:24:13,340
We can do this.

1760
02:24:15,220 --> 02:24:16,600
Okay, we gotta...

1761
02:24:16,600 --> 02:24:17,460
We'll do this.

1762
02:24:21,320 --> 02:24:21,880
Alright.

1763
02:24:22,540 --> 02:24:23,480
Oh, she's not that.

1764
02:24:23,560 --> 02:24:24,320
Not that, though.

1765
02:24:24,920 --> 02:24:25,260
Skip.

1766
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:26,940
Okay, we gotta do this again.

1767
02:24:27,560 --> 02:24:29,200
We gotta give him the remote.

1768
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:31,520
Alright.

1769
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:32,940
I can do this again.

1770
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:33,240
again.

1771
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:34,280
I remember.

1772
02:24:37,060 --> 02:24:37,060
Green.

1773
02:24:40,040 --> 02:24:40,040
Blue.

1774
02:24:41,780 --> 02:24:42,460
Wait, skip.

1775
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:44,820
I thank God.

1776
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:48,540
God, I'm such a.

1777
02:24:49,320 --> 02:24:51,640
I did find the remote control.

1778
02:24:51,940 --> 02:24:52,520
Did you find mine?

1779
02:24:52,780 --> 02:24:54,400
Yeah, I did it.

1780
02:24:54,660 --> 02:24:55,600
This is your remote control.

1781
02:24:56,520 --> 02:24:59,960
I know why there's a skip button on the mini game.

1782
02:25:00,100 --> 02:25:01,300
I believe in you, Doki.

1783
02:25:01,420 --> 02:25:09,000

1790
02:26:07,070 --> 02:26:07,710
We know he's...

1791
02:26:08,250 --> 02:26:10,270
He still does that?

1792
02:26:10,750 --> 02:26:12,110
Sophia, what are you doing?

1793
02:26:14,090 --> 02:26:15,450
Well, don't forget.

1794
02:26:16,290 --> 02:26:18,670
This is a game of I die, you die.

1795
02:26:19,750 --> 02:26:22,810
Fewer competitors, and that means that I've got a better
shot.

1796
02:26:24,030 --> 02:26:26,590
Jack, you're way too naive.

1797
02:26:26,930 --> 02:26:28,670
Wait, does that mean she's still on my side?

1798
02:26:29,010 --> 02:26:29,670
I don't want to die.

1799
02:26:30,150 --> 02:26:31,290
You said you'd give mine back.

1800
02:26:35,390 --> 02:26:48,310
this world is all about strong survivors and you're just too
young to see the ugliness of human nature those cheese and

1801
02:26:48,310 --> 02:27:01,580
eyes I kind of envy you what the fuck Ada come on you're a
mom why are you being so cold-blooded it's for my kids I've

1802
02:27:01,580 --> 02:27:07,820
got to make it no matter what if my guess is right that
destroyed number nine remote control should be

1803
02:27:15,530 --> 02:27:39,590
anna's oh Sophia you bitch bitch oh chill out it's almost
time this is no time to fight okay now we continue okay now

1804
02:27:39,590 --> 02:27:41,530
I should have my votes right

1805
02:27:46,130 --> 02:27:50,510
The smarter you play this game, the more dangerous you get.

1806
02:27:51,310 --> 02:27:55,610
Ladies, ladies, that's an erasadoki for everyone.

1807
02:27:58,270 --> 02:27:59,910
Man's mind's unpredictable.

1808
02:28:00,970 --> 02:28:02,950
I'm only gonna make decisions that benefit myself.

1809
02:28:04,570 --> 02:28:06,630
You should think about the same for yourself, Jack.

1810
02:28:07,910 --> 02:28:09,250
Jack, I believe.

1811
02:28:09,630 --> 02:28:10,050
Yay!

1812
02:28:12,630 --> 02:28:13,930
We got him!

1813
02:28:15,610 --> 02:28:16,050
of time.

1814
02:28:16,690 --> 02:28:17,910
We just need to hurry up and vote.

1815
02:28:18,190 --> 02:28:19,230
We're all going to die here.

1816
02:28:19,470 --> 02:28:20,870
He works for me now.

1817
02:28:29,100 --> 02:28:29,520
Leon.

1818
02:28:33,260 --> 02:28:34,820
Maybe I can still get Leon out.

1819
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:37,320
Oh, I have to vote for John.

1820
02:28:37,720 --> 02:28:38,960
Wait, I have his vote!

1821
02:28:39,320 --> 02:28:40,300
Wait, I have his vote!

1822
02:28:47,230 --> 02:28:47,970
Okay, nice.

1823
02:28:48,130 --> 02:28:49,230
Oh, guys, I win.

1824
02:28:51,290 --> 02:28:51,730
What?

1825
02:28:56,770 --> 02:28:57,490
Why me?

1826
02:28:57,510 --> 02:29:04,290
I didn't kill anyone because you voted for you guys can't do
this it wasn't all to the version of you but you killed you

1827
02:29:04,290 --> 02:29:15,970
you voted for me bitch no I can't help trust you you voted
for me for me yeah like what I said kid it's tough to read

1828
02:29:15,970 --> 02:29:23,870
people in this game I fucking knew it didn't you vote for me
too I wanted to live just as much as you did sorry John

1829
02:29:23,870 --> 02:29:28,610
there's nothing I can do I knew it I I can't believe it.

1830
02:29:28,650 --> 02:29:29,590
Who betrayed me first?

1831
02:29:29,810 --> 02:29:33,150
You all just killed an innocent man to save your own skins.

1832
02:29:33,330 --> 02:29:34,750
You did the same!

1833
02:29:36,930 --> 02:29:37,510
Whatever.

1834
02:29:38,530 --> 02:29:41,310
Pretty soon you're all gonna know what this feels like.

1835
02:29:42,430 --> 02:29:43,450
Turn on the headlamp.

1836
02:29:44,630 --> 02:29:46,590
Why did it have to be you?

1837
02:29:50,750 --> 02:29:52,770
Turn on the headlamp.

1838
02:29:53,470 --> 02:29:53,870
Yeah!

1839
02:29:55,630 --> 02:29:56,130
Yeah!

1840
02:30:03,910 --> 02:30:04,490
Zapping.

1841
02:30:06,030 --> 02:30:09,450
okay who else voted for me who's the other guy that voted
for me i wasn't checking

1842
02:30:17,480 --> 02:30:19,680
what the fuck jack

1843
02:30:30,070 --> 02:30:41,490
it was leon wasn't it we made it this far in the game what's
there to be afraid now yeah how could they blame thank you

1844
02:30:41,490 --> 02:30:49,690
make the super chat thank you bro jack what the fuck why are
you taking his belt like that ken was sorry to take me down

1845
02:30:49,690 --> 02:30:52,210
either i knew I need to survive.

1846
02:30:58,910 --> 02:30:59,470
Guys.

1847
02:31:02,390 --> 02:31:07,450
I think they weren't wrong when they said the game could be
four hours.

1848
02:31:09,390 --> 02:31:10,710
But I'm not going to lie.

1849
02:31:10,890 --> 02:31:14,130
I'm very immersed with this amazing writing.

1850
02:31:15,230 --> 02:31:19,110
Rolemakers must think that we're not motivated enough, which
is not very good for the game.

1851
02:31:19,630 --> 02:31:21,110
So using psychology.

1852
02:31:21,130 --> 02:31:25,990
and they're trying to provoke us with this dark spectacle.

1853
02:31:29,220 --> 02:31:34,160
All right, friends, let's embrace a new challenge to you and
remember the devil's got your back.

1854
02:31:35,960 --> 02:31:36,200
No!

1855
02:31:37,420 --> 02:31:38,660
It shouldn't be like this.

1856
02:31:39,380 --> 02:31:40,540
It's just a freaking game.

1857
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:43,080
How did it turn into this?

1858
02:31:43,480 --> 02:31:45,440
Inside the game, it's real life.

1859
02:31:46,600 --> 02:31:46,840
What's

1860
02:31:52,910 --> 02:31:53,510
the...

1861
02:31:53,510 --> 02:31:54,230
Me?

1862
02:31:54,630 --> 02:31:54,850
Or you.

1863
02:31:55,610 --> 02:31:56,630
Or even you.

1864
02:31:59,530 --> 02:32:01,290
I don't want to die here.

1865
02:32:01,970 --> 02:32:03,530
My kids are waiting for me at home.

1866
02:32:04,510 --> 02:32:06,050
I can't survive for that week.

1867
02:32:06,310 --> 02:32:08,650
Anna, please calm down.

1868
02:32:08,950 --> 02:32:10,750
Okay, someone fucking turn her mic on.

1869
02:32:11,070 --> 02:32:15,250
They always forget to turn her fucking mic on whenever she
has died.

1870
02:32:20,180 --> 02:32:20,660
Hey!

1871
02:32:21,640 --> 02:32:22,520
Stay away from me.

1872
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:23,660
Lynn didn't hurt anyone.

1873
02:32:24,660 --> 02:32:27,000
Plus, the game doesn't say that only one person can survive.

1874
02:32:27,880 --> 02:32:29,100
No one knows how this one.

1875
02:32:31,280 --> 02:32:45,380
get out a lot wow where did that come from screen i mean one
mistake and we're we're done you cowards oh you like hiding

1876
02:32:45,380 --> 02:32:56,840
well show yourself if you have the guts show yourself that's
enough hannah just isn't helping you need to stay awake all

1877
02:32:56,840 --> 02:33:04,640
the way from australia everyone listen up Fear and panic
will only send you to your doom faster.

1878
02:33:05,400 --> 02:33:10,540
If you want to survive, you might as well enjoy this wild
ride.

1879
02:33:13,340 --> 02:33:14,760
And don't be so soft.

1880
02:33:15,100 --> 02:33:16,000
I can't hear them.

1881
02:33:16,380 --> 02:33:17,020
I hope them.

1882
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:17,920
Yeah, they should boot.

1883
02:33:18,040 --> 02:33:20,080
I need the piano to be a little louder.

1884
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:23,720
I myself can't wait for the next round.

1885
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:28,320
And I feel like a huge reward that's coming with it.

1886
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:34,140
As expected.

1887
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:35,200
Yeah, and it's good for...

1888
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:36,580
They paid a lot for this...

1889
02:33:36,580 --> 02:33:37,980
For this piano music.

1890
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:39,240
I'm not famous anymore.

1891
02:33:39,900 --> 02:33:41,820
It doesn't take anything away from your charm.

1892
02:33:44,470 --> 02:33:47,550
This damn game designer is pulling the strings on all of us.

1893
02:33:48,390 --> 02:33:50,150
Deciding who lives and who dies.

1894
02:33:51,090 --> 02:33:53,130
John wasn't even the murder of the Ace of Hearts.

1895
02:33:53,490 --> 02:33:55,270
And yet he died right in front of me.

1896
02:33:56,410 --> 02:33:56,630
No.

1897
02:33:57,350 --> 02:33:58,750
This isn't how it's supposed to be.

1898
02:33:59,730 --> 02:34:03,150
We can't let these people behind the game treat us like
puppets.

1899
02:34:03,570 --> 02:34:05,410
Oh my god, people love revolution!

1900
02:34:06,450 --> 02:34:07,310
You're right, Jack.

1901
02:34:09,190 --> 02:34:11,330
They don't say that only one person can survive to the end.

1902
02:34:12,790 --> 02:34:14,230
So let's say you and I team up.

1903
02:34:14,910 --> 02:34:16,250
You can split the prize money equally.

1904
02:34:16,590 --> 02:34:19,230
Oh, 500 grand each before taxes?

1905
02:34:19,650 --> 02:34:19,870
Bro.

1906
02:34:20,130 --> 02:34:22,150
Do I get taxed from an evil death game?

1907
02:34:22,150 --> 02:34:22,730
I don't really care about the prize.

1908
02:34:22,910 --> 02:34:23,830
That would be fucking crazy.

1909
02:34:24,030 --> 02:34:26,270
But if we join forces, we might actually be able to get out
of here.

1910
02:34:26,270 --> 02:34:26,950
It's like the lottery.

1911
02:34:27,090 --> 02:34:29,970
You won the death game and then you still get taxed by the
government.

1912
02:34:30,470 --> 02:34:31,250
I was like, kidding.

1913
02:34:32,390 --> 02:34:32,750
Imagine.

1914
02:34:33,470 --> 02:34:34,710
Gotta get out of here.

1915
02:34:36,450 --> 02:34:36,850
Yeah.

1916
02:34:37,170 --> 02:34:40,270
Jack, I still might be able to find a bug in this game.

1917
02:34:41,210 --> 02:34:44,090
After all, I'm a hacker and a good one too.

1918
02:34:51,990 --> 02:34:53,470
I trust you, George.

1919
02:34:54,230 --> 02:34:58,110
You're 19 and you experience the deep web, the dark web.

1920
02:34:58,310 --> 02:35:01,170
I trust you, but you really need to take care of yourself
first.

1921
02:35:01,210 --> 02:35:04,390
Bro, he does, he's like, he's accessed the dark web before.

1922
02:35:05,810 --> 02:35:06,810
And he's 19.

1923
02:35:07,050 --> 02:35:08,170
He's the hacker's man.

1924
02:35:09,530 --> 02:35:10,810
Look he's doing it now.

1925
02:35:10,950 --> 02:35:11,990
If you were as good as you said, you would.

1926
02:35:12,010 --> 02:35:12,230
were.

1927
02:35:13,310 --> 02:35:14,990
You'd have made it out of here already, young man.

1928
02:35:16,770 --> 02:35:22,870
As you can see, Jack is a game designer, George is a hacker,
and Lynn is a cop.

1929
02:35:24,330 --> 02:35:27,050
We have all these people here, and yet none of us can seem
to make it out.

1930
02:35:27,370 --> 02:35:28,430
Because we never work together.

1931
02:35:28,810 --> 02:35:30,730
Everyone who has tried is is dead.

1932
02:35:32,830 --> 02:35:36,490
So tell me, who can change this game?

1933
02:35:37,050 --> 02:35:37,830
All of us.

1934
02:35:38,250 --> 02:35:38,250
Nobody.

1935
02:35:38,730 --> 02:35:38,850
Oh.

1936
02:35:39,690 --> 02:35:41,570
The best you can do is survive to the end.

1937
02:35:43,510 --> 02:35:53,550
friendship and you know who wouldn't want that prize money i
need to win that money get my kids away from that jerk and

1938
02:35:53,550 --> 02:35:54,330
build them a better life

1939
02:35:58,130 --> 02:36:06,090
look okay i why does he need why do we have to let him end
up back on the street oh because he's homeless okay either

1940
02:36:06,090 --> 02:36:12,850
way it's no big okay evil wig i was gonna say why the do i
give him the money Oh, not the sick kid.

1941
02:36:12,870 --> 02:36:14,050
Are you counting on me to turn this around?

1942
02:36:14,310 --> 02:36:14,450
Oh, no.

1943
02:36:14,570 --> 02:36:15,510
I can't just leave them to hang.

1944
02:36:17,090 --> 02:36:23,190
Then, Jack, trying to escape might get us all killed, right?

1945
02:36:23,990 --> 02:36:28,970
I mean, continuing the game and trying to escape.

1946
02:36:29,170 --> 02:36:30,090
I'm not the sick kid.

1947
02:36:30,290 --> 02:36:32,250
Isn't it the point of this game?

1948
02:36:34,010 --> 02:36:36,430
Anna, we can't let anyone boss us around.

1949
02:36:38,890 --> 02:36:39,870
This isn't a game.

1950
02:36:41,050 --> 02:36:41,930
It's a straight up story.

1951
02:36:42,010 --> 02:36:55,210
daughter can't you see that don't you want to save lynn not
hungry i want to save her i want to save my waifu honor

1952
02:36:55,210 --> 02:37:05,910
think about your friend lynn you're such an ungrateful oh
that's not what in love with lynn that's not what i said why

1953
02:37:12,880 --> 02:37:24,040
you're a criminal profile right if you help me out I'll have
your back you're not grateful women I did not think I was

1954
02:37:24,040 --> 02:37:35,060
gonna say that it's literally the women derogatory bro I
don't I'm really I don't know I don't know if I'm good with

1955
02:37:35,060 --> 02:37:41,940
words guys but I talked to women but I have to figure out
the loophole in this whole game because behind this game

1956
02:37:41,940 --> 02:37:48,960
there must be a secret that i want to know and i believe it
must be connected to the conrad family i'm not about to let

1957
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:53,780
them turn me into some sacrificial lamb i'm going to expose
them for what they really are

1958
02:37:57,940 --> 02:38:05,440
hello lamb i'm afraid it won't be easy for us to get out of
here safely in this current situation following me will be

1959
02:38:05,440 --> 02:38:17,160
dangerous you should think more about yourself and not
really have to be with me oh jack i believe in you i mean

1960
02:38:17,160 --> 02:38:34,320
face has got to be in our hands right we can't just give up
hug her don't worry he's like oh contestants are not allowed

1961
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:41,720
to hug after the voting ends we're led into a new room the
common tune from behind the door might give us a chance to

1962
02:38:41,720 --> 02:38:47,160
catch your breath oh hey it's a strip club

1963
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:52,280
whoa oh hey

1964
02:38:56,660 --> 02:39:06,460
hey guys yeah where's my car metallic 1926 you think she
took my cards after a hug there no that's way too smart

1965
02:39:06,460 --> 02:39:19,980
there's no way i didn't expect this looks like this place
isn't bad at all not every club is a strip club cash product

1966
02:39:19,980 --> 02:39:22,640
five million dollars yay

1967
02:39:26,120 --> 02:39:33,480
holy crap this looks like at least a couple of mil it feels
so great to have all this cash in front of me and i can

1968
02:39:33,480 --> 02:39:39,940
spend it as much as i want insane oh i'm oh Oh, the trippy
gas.

1969
02:39:40,560 --> 02:39:43,380
The smoke has a strange, pungent odor.

1970
02:39:43,700 --> 02:39:44,920
Oh, hey, my third one.

1971
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:47,600
Dizzy, I suspect there's something off about it.

1972
02:39:47,780 --> 02:39:49,600
Oh, Jack, her eyes are up there, Jack.

1973
02:39:50,140 --> 02:39:50,480
Jack?

1974
02:39:50,960 --> 02:39:52,540
Or, oh, Jack.

1975
02:40:04,170 --> 02:40:06,050
Well, I like looked away.

1976
02:40:06,150 --> 02:40:07,650
I know for sure Jack's straight.

1977
02:40:09,810 --> 02:40:10,930
Okay, at least we know.

1978
02:40:11,510 --> 02:40:11,850

Hold left click to tilt the candle to fall.

Oh, okay.

1984

Oh, shit.

fucking contestants is save lalita that's like crazy

2067
02:47:06,840 --> 02:47:15,280
look at them it's like ever since the game started everybody
started to cut loose and go wild yeah because we're drugged

2068
02:47:15,280 --> 02:47:22,940
up bro why do you think the manipulators are doing this i
can't imagine it's just a sweet and a deal for us it's not

2069
02:47:22,940 --> 02:47:32,580
for our benefit oh what's the range marriage girl they're
not very generous they want us caught up in our desires And

2070
02:47:32,580 --> 02:47:35,600
money is the quickest way to unmasking the darkest parts of
human nature.

2071
02:47:35,920 --> 02:47:37,640
Why did the manipulators do this?

2072
02:47:37,780 --> 02:47:38,380
I don't know.

2073
02:47:38,740 --> 02:47:40,640
Maybe to manipulate us.

2074
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,140
Reminds me of an experiment that I was a part of once.

2075
02:47:45,740 --> 02:47:46,560
Pretty unforgettable.

2076
02:47:47,920 --> 02:47:48,460
What experiment?

2077
02:47:49,080 --> 02:47:50,540
You've worked for the Conrad family?

2078
02:47:52,660 --> 02:47:54,360
Curiosity can be dangerous, buddy.

2079
02:47:56,020 --> 02:47:56,660
Oh, hey.

2080
02:47:58,240 --> 02:48:00,800
Oh, she got some news for him.

2081
02:48:02,580 --> 02:48:03,940
Oh, that bitch.

2082
02:48:04,960 --> 02:48:05,740
Wife number two.

2083
02:48:06,740 --> 02:48:07,520
It's because she's mad.

2084
02:48:07,680 --> 02:48:08,980
She's not wife number one.

2085
02:48:14,890 --> 02:48:16,410
But I love to talk to you though.

2086
02:48:16,990 --> 02:48:21,410
Since your lover is a political rival of the Conrad family,
you probably know a thing or two about them.

2087
02:48:22,130 --> 02:48:23,850
Can you tell me something about the Conrad family?

2088
02:48:25,190 --> 02:48:27,730
Why are you so interested in the Conrad family?

2089
02:48:28,590 --> 02:48:29,810
Does it have something to do with you?

2090
02:48:31,530 --> 02:48:32,450
Well, no.

2091
02:48:33,810 --> 02:48:41,030
Actually, I have a feeling this game has something to do
with the conrad family maybe the information do not fall for

2092
02:48:41,030 --> 02:48:53,940
it again um fall for it again award goes to all right if i
remember correctly the last president of the conrad family

2093
02:48:53,940 --> 02:49:04,080
was assassinated was because of my ex he gave down specific
details about the president's travel plans and that's why

2094
02:49:04,080 --> 02:49:22,080
the she's the problem well not technically no she was just
there what does the conrad family not do they have something

2095
02:49:22,080 --> 02:49:35,520
beyond beyond the weapons like what that's a weapon tribes
in africa in exchange they're selling it to tribes and what

2096
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:49,140
the fuck okay okay what Okay, imagine a fucking random
African tribe with a nuclear bomb Or like a bio weapon like

2097
02:49:49,140 --> 02:49:56,500
that's yeah, that's like riddles of the evil ass plot Yeah,
they fucking gave a tribe in Africa a fucking bio weapon.

2098
02:49:56,860 --> 02:50:08,100
That's crazy And that's Resident Evil 5 right now Of course
they are and that's part of why my ex was satirized

2099
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:21,140
fascinated but I'm just one of his many flanks so I never
believed in me anyways if uh unlucky I mean that's a crazy I

2100
02:50:21,140 --> 02:50:28,720
mean if you told me your ex-husband is selling bio weapons
to tribes in Africa I'd be like what are you okay like I I

2101
02:50:28,720 --> 02:50:41,680
would not believe like the I'll be like the Resident Evil 5
fly how much you had just uh tiny little bit but can't you

2102
02:50:41,680 --> 02:50:58,980
see we've all been drugged you mean the spray earlier from
the start yeah they used to use it back there too oh back

2103
02:50:58,980 --> 02:51:08,080
where how'd you know that yeah the smell it smelled that
same way

2104
02:51:12,230 --> 02:51:23,590
do you guys use that spray when you fight first time to hear
no there's some mercenary uh domestication control type of

2105
02:51:23,590 --> 02:51:33,150
shape it was that stuff doesn't really help with conrad so
all of us here has connection with the conrad family i just

2106
02:51:33,150 --> 02:51:45,410
realized that we're all connected somehow or like some of us
are the strongest of course i used to run a squad that used

2107
02:51:45,410 --> 02:51:46,550
to get rid of all those terrorists

2108
02:51:50,820 --> 02:52:01,060
hey jack what do you say yeah i got a couple more drinks
tomorrow's not promised maybe he used to be an ex security

2109
02:52:01,060 --> 02:52:06,920
worker for the conrad family that's why he's homeless the
homeless guy i'll accept it Fuck it.

2110
02:52:07,100 --> 02:52:07,540
Let's go.

2111
02:52:08,780 --> 02:52:09,900
Let's, like, go.

2112
02:52:10,320 --> 02:52:10,580
We're home.

2113
02:52:10,640 --> 02:52:10,920
Oh, wait.

2114
02:52:10,980 --> 02:52:11,760
Oh, it's arm wrestling.

2115
02:52:11,880 --> 02:52:13,340
Okay, I thought he was telling me what drinks.

2116
02:52:15,640 --> 02:52:16,440
That's right.

2117
02:52:17,140 --> 02:52:17,460
Shit.

2118
02:52:18,700 --> 02:52:19,420
There you go.

2119
02:52:20,440 --> 02:52:21,100
That's right.

2120
02:52:21,700 --> 02:52:23,320
Not so strong now.

2121
02:52:27,210 --> 02:52:28,890
I have a wooden keyboard.

2122
02:52:30,410 --> 02:52:32,070
We're holding hands, guys.

2123
02:52:36,770 --> 02:52:37,870
Okay, what the fuck?

2124
02:52:38,050 --> 02:52:38,330
There's no way.

2125
02:52:38,350 --> 02:52:39,110
I should be winning.

2126
02:52:41,850 --> 02:52:44,890
Oh my god, bros, bros being bros.

2127
02:52:45,670 --> 02:52:47,110
We're holding hands very tightly.

2128
02:52:51,420 --> 02:52:52,920
Just the two of us.

2129
02:52:56,220 --> 02:52:57,980
Just the two of us.

2130
02:53:01,040 --> 02:53:02,720
There's a technique to arm wrestling.

2131
02:53:02,800 --> 02:53:03,780
You don't have to be strong.

2132
02:53:04,200 --> 02:53:05,360
It's just how you grip it.

2133
02:53:07,440 --> 02:53:07,680
Yeah.

2134
02:53:09,800 --> 02:53:24,780
right when did you get sober i might have stumbled upon some
useful info game designer strength yeah how does a game

2135
02:53:24,780 --> 02:53:38,460
designer win this oh let's go we're always method acting
right now what a crazy day

2136
02:53:43,400 --> 02:53:45,060
I like that.

2137
02:53:45,400 --> 02:53:46,600
Okay, that gets fun.

2138
02:53:48,020 --> 02:53:49,560
The guy on the cat, the guy.

2139
02:53:50,120 --> 02:53:56,580
The person who is likely responsible for assassinating the
last terrorists in the Conrad family is my father.

2140
02:53:58,460 --> 02:54:03,360
Sophia says her lover is probably the one who provoked my
father with the presidential itinerary.

2141
02:54:04,940 --> 02:54:07,500
Daniel, who used to work for the Conrad family.

2142
02:54:07,620 --> 02:54:08,780
Oh, it's all connecting together.

2143
02:54:08,940 --> 02:54:09,620
It's all coming together.

2144
02:54:09,900 --> 02:54:11,740
This part of a mercenary unit focused on capturing people.

2145
02:54:11,760 --> 02:54:23,200
terrorists oh daniel killed is just us suleiman's daniel
killed his father it's all connected the warriors protecting

2146
02:54:23,200 --> 02:54:31,420
our family yet we're labeled as terrorists the conrad family
commits countless despicable acts and gets away with them

2147
02:54:31,420 --> 02:54:40,140
what exactly have we done wrong it's because there are bases
that's everything and i will never let the history of the

2148
02:54:40,140 --> 02:54:40,520
sham be

2149
02:54:43,760 --> 02:54:52,640
all right the game goes on forever yeah i got it a cycle of
violence with no end you can't stand seeing it repeat can't

2150
02:54:52,640 --> 02:55:02,920
imagine how many lost souls so believe it's their only hope
they don't realize they're just lambs to the slaughter jack

2151
02:55:02,920 --> 02:55:15,980
i got a signal it's a relic again and this time there's an
extra word boomerang a club a boomerang what does it mean

2152
02:55:18,400 --> 02:55:29,080
yeah i i don't really get it either maybe it's boomerang
club nod i don't really know captain boomerang it seems

2153
02:55:29,080 --> 02:55:34,740
peter wants to lead the recipients to a certain place what

2154
02:55:39,180 --> 02:55:47,300
the fuck it's boomerang this matches nothing because it's
wood?

2155
02:55:51,160 --> 02:55:56,900
I would assume cellar because it's wood.

2156
02:55:58,320 --> 02:56:02,140
But like, the guard office looks really cool though.

2157
02:56:02,940 --> 02:56:08,460
What the fuck does Australia gotta do with lawn, cellar, or
a guard office?

2158
02:56:08,720 --> 02:56:10,200
Lawn because it's outside?

2159
02:56:11,580 --> 02:56:13,780
Oh, you play with one on the lawn!

2160
02:56:13,980 --> 02:56:15,180
Wait, you're so right!

2161
02:56:15,360 --> 02:56:21,380
I mean, you could technically pledge Looks like this answer
is wrong Okay, guys, come on I just have to wait till next

2162
02:56:21,380 --> 02:56:26,740
time to contact Peter Come on, I knew it I fucking knew it
was Seller God damn it

2163
02:56:32,260 --> 02:56:40,680
I fucking relic and Seller backwards I can't do anything
Until we figure out everything I'll go find Leon in the

2164
02:56:40,680 --> 02:56:41,460
other room first

2165
02:56:47,540 --> 02:56:51,120
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

2166
02:56:54,200 --> 02:56:55,580
Okay, wait, guys.

2167
02:57:02,030 --> 02:57:02,650
Oh, my God.

2168
02:57:02,890 --> 02:57:07,850
I think Relic is like, when you spell it backwards, it's
like cellar, right?

2169
02:57:07,910 --> 02:57:09,330
So that should be right it.

2170
02:57:09,610 --> 02:57:10,750
That would play the boomerang.

2171
02:57:11,030 --> 02:57:13,270
If Peter didn't want to tell us something, he would have
ignored us completely.

2172
02:57:14,810 --> 02:57:16,210
Wait, I think I bugged it out.

2173
02:57:16,390 --> 02:57:17,230
Or maybe correct.

2174
02:57:18,550 --> 02:57:20,870
And why did he reply with the word error?

2175
02:57:22,370 --> 02:57:25,090
And even if we can find the clues in this cellar.

2176
02:57:25,090 --> 02:57:26,170
Guys, I glitched it.

2177
02:57:27,130 --> 02:57:28,750
I messed it up, guys.

2178
02:57:28,850 --> 02:57:30,470
If we break in by force, we'll probably...

2179
02:57:30,470 --> 02:57:31,150
It's okay, it's okay.

2180
02:57:31,510 --> 02:57:33,830
We're just gonna look at this face.

2181
02:57:35,210 --> 02:57:36,150
But we're running out of signal.

2182
02:57:36,890 --> 02:57:40,150
The quicker we find an answer, the more response we might
get from Peter.

2183
02:57:44,500 --> 02:57:45,280
It's okay, it's okay.

2184
02:57:45,760 --> 02:57:47,220
It'll fix itself, guys.

2185
02:57:47,440 --> 02:57:48,520
Error is the answer.

2186
02:57:50,660 --> 02:57:53,300
Maybe it isn't a noun, but a verb.

2187
02:57:56,440 --> 02:57:58,340
Man, you're a genius, right?

2188
02:57:59,380 --> 02:58:09,040
told you to our answer to the clue but rather to the players
themselves if we make an error we will end up locked up so

2189
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:17,720
we want to so we want to go to the cellar those who have an
error are locked up if so we need to check the answer again

2190
02:58:17,720 --> 02:58:26,560
no it's okay guys it's okay it'll fix when i get another
choice it'll fix itself guys i think i skipped but too hard

2191
02:58:26,560 --> 02:58:34,200
oh see there you go a new message George's watch the
beginning of eternally the end of time and space the dawn of

2192
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:42,900
forever the sunset of time the beginning of end and the end
of every place the start of the end the finish of all places

2193
02:58:43,680 --> 02:58:53,500
yeah okay it didn't fix itself guys I have to go back I the
answer is wrong okay okay okay now we can watch this in

2194
02:58:53,500 --> 02:59:01,120
motion we still have a signal if Peter didn't want to tell
us something all right you guys listen to this i gotta pee

2195
02:59:01,120 --> 02:59:11,580
you guys can listen to the seller may be correct then why
did he reply with the word error and even if we can find the

2196
02:59:11,580 --> 02:59:18,800
clues in the seller how are we going to get there if we
break in by force we'll probably get discovered by the

2197
02:59:18,800 --> 02:59:27,140
guards i'm not sure but we're running out of signal the
quicker we find an answer the more response we might get

2198
02:59:27,140 --> 02:59:27,560
from peter

2199
02:59:33,620 --> 02:59:35,920
What if error is the answer?

2200
02:59:37,760 --> 02:59:41,280
Maybe it isn't a noun but a verb?

2201
02:59:43,920 --> 02:59:45,900
Lynn, you're a genius, yeah.

2202
02:59:46,520 --> 02:59:52,200
Error isn't referring to our answer to the clue, but rather
to the players themselves.

2203
02:59:53,020 --> 02:59:55,900
If we make an error, we will end up locked up.

2204
02:59:56,980 --> 03:00:01,780
So the seller is the place where those who have an error are
locked up.

2205
03:00:02,420 --> 03:00:05,100
If so, We need to check the answer again.

2206
03:00:05,860 --> 03:00:08,920
If there's a response, it means our guess is correct.

2207
03:00:11,660 --> 03:00:12,160
Oh, my God.

2208
03:00:12,360 --> 03:00:13,700
They're still going?

2209
03:00:14,380 --> 03:00:16,360
This cutscene was so long.

2210
03:00:16,540 --> 03:00:17,920
Oh, I just made it back in time.

2211
03:00:19,300 --> 03:00:22,460
Nexi, Diggs, Gordon, Sephora, Medi, Allen.

2212
03:00:22,740 --> 03:00:23,560
Thank you for the super chat.

2213
03:00:23,700 --> 03:00:23,940
Thank you.

2214
03:00:23,980 --> 03:00:24,620
Thank you.

2215
03:00:25,440 --> 03:00:26,020
All right.

2216
03:00:26,320 --> 03:00:26,720
Yeah.

2217
03:00:27,520 --> 03:00:27,920
Perfect.

2218
03:00:28,020 --> 03:00:28,540
We got it.

2219
03:00:28,840 --> 03:00:29,280
We did it.

2220
03:00:29,400 --> 03:00:30,060
But we've lost the signal.

2221
03:00:31,160 --> 03:00:32,260
Peter's going to want to tell us more.

2222
03:00:32,600 --> 03:00:33,600
We have to plan our next move.

2223
03:00:33,620 --> 03:00:41,980
first try but what does the message mean it sounds so
philosophical but i don't even think they know what you're

2224
03:00:41,980 --> 03:00:47,940
talking about honestly i think we're just making up as we go
along i think the writers were like i didn't think this

2225
03:00:47,940 --> 03:00:50,760
person was gonna play this far into the game

2226
03:00:54,680 --> 03:00:59,340
he's like i didn't think you were gonna make it this far i
thought you were gonna get your refund i'll just need some

2227
03:00:59,340 --> 03:01:10,720
time this game is under strict surveillance If I cause
trouble now, I could be executed.

2228
03:01:11,100 --> 03:01:13,040
Even if I manage to get to the city.

2229
03:01:13,600 --> 03:01:15,420
Now you guys care about surveillance.

2230
03:01:15,880 --> 03:01:19,500
You've been fucking blurting out everything as we go along.

2231
03:01:19,700 --> 03:01:21,380
I miss the chance to find out the truth.

2232
03:01:21,840 --> 03:01:23,600
So I'll have to find another way.

2233
03:01:27,470 --> 03:01:29,090
Alright, sorry to commotion.

2234
03:01:29,690 --> 03:01:30,570
I gotta be a hero.

2235
03:01:31,610 --> 03:01:33,470
We have to make sure the guards lock us up.

2236
03:01:34,470 --> 03:01:35,050
Leave it to me.

2237
03:01:35,630 --> 03:01:37,310
I'm better at causing trouble than anyone else.

2238
03:01:37,850 --> 03:01:39,410
No, not the hackers, man.

2239
03:01:41,070 --> 03:01:51,810
no george is too damn yeah we gotta keep him alive and that
way even if he fails you'll be safe i agree maybe we'll find

2240
03:01:51,810 --> 03:02:02,010
nothing and maybe you can help us at the critical moment
from the outside sounds good in that case i'll be on standby

2241
03:02:02,010 --> 03:02:11,570
are you sure you want to do this with me we may not be able
to escape from the cellar yeah don't worry We'll do it for

2242
03:02:11,570 --> 03:02:11,930
love.

2243
03:02:11,950 --> 03:02:14,010
Thank you for the cheer.

2244
03:02:15,450 --> 03:02:16,390
George, you loser!

2245
03:02:16,750 --> 03:02:17,730
Get away from me!

2246
03:02:17,790 --> 03:02:18,910
Hey, what the hell was that for?

2247
03:02:19,110 --> 03:02:22,190
Hey, you be nice to her, otherwise I'll kick your ass.

2248
03:02:22,950 --> 03:02:24,110
Wait, isn't there so much?

2249
03:02:24,310 --> 03:02:26,350
Yeah, I was gonna say, are there people sleeping?

2250
03:02:26,430 --> 03:02:27,030
I didn't do anything.

2251
03:02:27,150 --> 03:02:29,550
She started it and cursed at me.

2252
03:02:29,870 --> 03:02:30,270
Oh!

2253
03:02:30,590 --> 03:02:31,110
Stop it, alright?

2254
03:02:31,270 --> 03:02:32,010
I'll let you fall.

2255
03:02:32,450 --> 03:02:34,090
As long as you won't let this slide.

2256
03:02:38,770 --> 03:02:39,990
She's gotta make it look good.

2257
03:02:40,010 --> 03:02:40,850
real again.

2258
03:02:40,990 --> 03:02:42,230
I'm so sorry, sir.

2259
03:02:42,350 --> 03:02:42,990
I didn't mean to hit you.

2260
03:02:43,090 --> 03:02:45,110
I was just trying to teach this damn girl a lesson.

2261
03:02:45,710 --> 03:02:47,050
He meant it.

2262
03:02:47,710 --> 03:02:48,410
Make them pray.

2263
03:02:49,390 --> 03:02:50,550
George, that looked real.

2264
03:02:50,570 --> 03:02:57,430
Get him, get out of here.

2265
03:03:02,160 --> 03:03:05,500
The one, that kicked it, George looked a little real though.

2266
03:03:11,290 --> 03:03:12,970
Doesn't seem to be in this room.

2267
03:03:16,390 --> 03:03:18,630
Seems like we can't get out.

2268
03:03:20,310 --> 03:03:21,710
Oh, it makes a word!

2269
03:03:25,190 --> 03:03:26,250
It's a G.

2270
03:03:28,950 --> 03:03:29,430
Amazing.

2271
03:03:30,550 --> 03:03:31,190
It's the alphabet.

2272
03:03:32,650 --> 03:03:35,050
But why put 26 letters in it?

2273
03:03:36,350 --> 03:03:38,090
Do you think this could be a clue from Peter?

2274
03:03:40,570 --> 03:03:42,130
It deals with me.

2275
03:03:44,070 --> 03:03:58,950
Beginning of eternity, the end of time and space, the
beginning of end, and that end of every place oh shit I

2276
03:03:58,950 --> 03:04:11,070
didn't pay attention because she was like she wakes at
interval she looking wakes at interval nice job nice job

Lynn nice job guys I don't even know what to pick guys wait

2279
03:04:30,130 --> 03:04:36,830
It's like a she's never seen so many letters before Oh, it

2280
03:04:37,110 --> 03:04:38,170
Yeah, it's E.

03:05:11,240 --> 03:05:17,640
oh pita since you can see these messages you must know to
help me get out of here okay not gonna lie he looks like

that's where he went yeah after he got he whistle blown he

2287
03:05:25,620 --> 03:05:26,600

2288
03:05:31,300 --> 03:05:34,160
he went to try acting in this game

2289
03:05:41,340 --> 03:05:44,580
we found him guys we found snowden

2290
03:05:47,910 --> 03:05:53,990
i couldn't accept the sheer cruelty of what they were doing
but when i tried to escape game materials and expose their

2291
03:05:53,990 --> 03:06:03,290
plan oh my god he's gonna whistle blow oh my god he joined a
jocular he went to code for the jocular claims and now he's

it is him never escaped their clutches.

2294
03:06:22,660 --> 03:06:24,800
Edward Snowden starts with E.

2295
03:06:25,340 --> 03:06:27,000
That's why it's in E.

2296
03:06:28,120 --> 03:06:30,960
That person will be the only help to save everyone in this
cruel game.

2297
03:06:32,940 --> 03:06:37,720
Pleading the last challenge, the winners of each session
will all be sent to the secret room for psychiatrist named Z

2298
03:06:37,720 --> 03:06:38,060
here.

2299
03:06:45,620 --> 03:06:46,080
Alive.

2300
03:06:46,200 --> 03:06:49,440
Oh my god, the writing is actually too smart for us.

2301
03:07:19,280 --> 03:07:20,100
What's even happening?

2302
03:07:20,200 --> 03:07:21,120
He's whistleblowing.

2303
03:07:22,160 --> 03:07:22,620
Again!

2304
03:07:24,780 --> 03:07:26,840
He just can't stop.

2305
03:07:26,980 --> 03:07:27,940
The monitoring system.

2306
03:07:38,720 --> 03:07:40,860
I know a secret escape room.

2307
03:07:59,270 --> 03:08:00,590
God bless you.

2308
03:08:02,550 --> 03:08:05,030
Yeah, he's definitely looking down on the script.

2309
03:08:08,650 --> 03:08:10,810
All right, there's his...

2310
03:08:11,730 --> 03:08:13,030
There's the secrets.

2311
03:08:14,270 --> 03:08:14,990
I'm in.

2312
03:08:20,920 --> 03:08:22,280
Oh, there's the map.

2313
03:08:23,800 --> 03:08:24,200
Okay.

2314
03:08:25,660 --> 03:08:28,440
Found in the guard could be useful.

2315
03:08:29,140 --> 03:08:30,440
That's a secret.

2316
03:08:30,940 --> 03:08:32,260
What the fuck is secret?

2317
03:08:32,480 --> 03:08:33,120
Okay, lab.

2318
03:08:33,320 --> 03:08:33,780
Secret.

2319
03:08:34,500 --> 03:08:34,940
Event.

2320
03:08:37,580 --> 03:08:38,800
Well, we can't use this map now.

2321
03:08:39,960 --> 03:08:43,240
There's gotta be strict security in the VIP room with so
many celebrities there.

2322
03:08:44,240 --> 03:08:45,900
I don't think we can escape.

2323
03:08:47,380 --> 03:08:48,660
Just as I expected.

2324
03:08:49,720 --> 03:09:03,740
When I was investing in those missing people, a clown car
would pass by every time is that not suspicious a fucking

2325
03:09:03,740 --> 03:09:16,760
random clown car just like peterson it's all a conspiracy by
the conrad okay i didn't expect william conrad who is

2326
03:09:16,760 --> 03:09:19,290
running for president this time to be among them

2327
03:09:24,540 --> 03:09:25,720
Nice job, Interpol.

2328
03:09:26,120 --> 03:09:28,680
I feel like you would stop a clown car at that point.

2329
03:09:28,760 --> 03:09:29,860
To prepare for the next game.

2330
03:09:30,340 --> 03:09:32,160
I'm sorry, though, what now?

2331
03:09:32,320 --> 03:09:33,660
You must escape with the other.

2332
03:09:36,720 --> 03:09:37,980
Where are you taking us?

2333
03:09:39,240 --> 03:09:40,140
Oh, shit.

2334
03:09:44,830 --> 03:09:51,690
The raid is too smart for us because after two hours, the
king cries your IQ to the single digits.

2335
03:09:52,150 --> 03:09:53,390
Gordon, thank you for the super chat.

2336
03:09:53,430 --> 03:09:56,590
Oh, my God, bro, what the fuck?

2337
03:09:56,870 --> 03:10:26,420
now it's now saw now it's saw oh shit oh no it's fine I'm
Wayne oh oh is the bully oh it's a drama this is my

2338
03:10:26,420 --> 03:10:36,800
territory little brat I fucking He loves this game.

2339
03:10:43,270 --> 03:10:44,570
Whoa, backstory.

2340
03:10:46,450 --> 03:10:48,370
Okay, okay, excuse me.

2341
03:10:50,050 --> 03:10:51,890
Okay, apparently they did not tie.

2342
03:10:52,170 --> 03:10:55,110
They did not fucking restrain myself enough.

2343
03:10:56,050 --> 03:11:00,190
I just, yeah, I think they forgot to put ropes on my end.

2344
03:11:01,130 --> 03:11:04,170
No, I guess he even died up.

2345
03:11:07,170 --> 03:11:08,130
I'll live.

2346
03:11:09,670 --> 03:11:13,830
These bastards, the power of Shabu!

2347
03:11:14,250 --> 03:11:15,170
And expose all of this.

2348
03:11:17,450 --> 03:11:19,750
I remember you said you had read some old files.

2349
03:11:20,810 --> 03:11:23,190
How much do you know about the history of the Conrad family?

2350
03:11:24,310 --> 03:11:27,890
I read files about the Conrad family when I was dealing with
the case before.

2351
03:11:28,850 --> 03:11:33,930
But it was old, and the early materials about the Conrad
family were toned up.

2352
03:11:34,590 --> 03:11:35,910
Oh no, they were redacted.

2353
03:11:35,970 --> 03:11:38,390
Only detailed records on the remaining pages.

2354
03:11:38,410 --> 03:11:43,810
It's about a poker company named Kingdom in 1850.

2355
03:11:45,470 --> 03:11:58,090
At that time, Edward Conrad, the heir of the Conrad family,
added the Joker into poker for the first time and released a

2356
03:11:58,090 --> 03:11:59,690
comic book simultaneously.

2357
03:12:01,050 --> 03:12:01,970
I know that comic book.

2358
03:12:02,890 --> 03:12:04,570
My father showed it to me when I was a kid.

2359
03:12:05,530 --> 03:12:11,770
The comic book tells that the ancestors of the comic book
family won a battle and satirized the members of the royal

2360
03:12:11,770 --> 03:12:20,410
family of defeated countries in every possible way it's
extremely shameless they invented that joker the jungler

2361
03:12:20,410 --> 03:12:30,530
history about the karmic family nothing special just this is
the first game a streamer played that i have not attempted

2362
03:12:30,530 --> 03:12:40,810
to play it's okay guys i sacrificed myself so you don't have
to buy this game

2363
03:12:44,050 --> 03:12:51,830
I guess the Conrad family started their military industrial
business and gained political status after what they earned

2364
03:12:52,430 --> 03:13:00,760
The Conrad family has been doing evil the money and power
they have gained over the years are based on trampling on

2365
03:13:00,760 --> 03:13:06,020
the bones of other people's countries But with such a huge
foundation.

2366
03:13:06,040 --> 03:13:18,560
I love this game because it's like watching a bad movie, but
I can also play I can be involved in the terrible movie I

2367
03:13:18,560 --> 03:13:21,230
believe the truth will reveal one day

2368
03:13:24,400 --> 03:13:36,920
I could fund Junkler the Junkler games too I would love to
be an investor of the Junkler games for countless years my

2369
03:13:36,920 --> 03:13:38,460
father has fought against them

2370
03:13:46,920 --> 03:13:51,540
when I was a child my father always told me magical stories
before I went to sleep.

2371
03:13:55,500 --> 03:13:56,140
Okay.

2372
03:13:57,460 --> 03:13:59,440
Okay, that's AI.

2373
03:14:04,060 --> 03:14:06,160
Bro, they could have just got her.

2374
03:14:06,480 --> 03:14:07,120
Oh, yeah, no.

2375
03:14:07,620 --> 03:14:07,640
No.

2376
03:14:11,340 --> 03:14:13,140
Oh, my God.

2377
03:14:13,520 --> 03:14:16,340
I'm watching a fucking mobile ad right now.

2378
03:14:16,760 --> 03:14:17,960
Oh, my God.

2379
03:14:19,040 --> 03:14:25,780
saved the youngest prince and gave him the power of the
flowers making his decisions fight to recapture the ultimate

2380
03:14:25,780 --> 03:14:41,760
generations what the fuck was that scene I'm watching a
fucking movie I'll add a movie for the kiss yay

2381
03:14:46,920 --> 03:14:51,160
I deserve that kiss after I had to watch an AI cutscene.

2382
03:14:52,060 --> 03:14:52,840
Get some rest.

2383
03:14:53,660 --> 03:14:55,460
We have important tasks tomorrow.

2384
03:14:56,660 --> 03:14:57,920
Dominance claim.

2385
03:14:58,700 --> 03:15:00,100
I deserve that.

2386
03:15:13,370 --> 03:15:15,730
Chad, I knew you'd make it back alive.

2387
03:15:16,370 --> 03:15:17,170
I did it.

2388
03:15:17,290 --> 03:15:17,850
Oh, great.

2389
03:15:18,930 --> 03:15:20,550
I suggest you stop causing trouble.

2390
03:15:20,650 --> 03:15:21,650
We don't want to be involved.

2391
03:15:24,010 --> 03:15:25,870
Kid, what happened to you?

2392
03:15:26,810 --> 03:15:28,110
You look so pale.

2393
03:15:28,670 --> 03:15:29,650
It's nothing.

2394
03:15:30,110 --> 03:15:31,450
Just a small punishment.

2395
03:15:34,090 --> 03:15:36,070
Did you find any clues?

2396
03:15:36,850 --> 03:15:36,910
Yes.

2397
03:15:36,910 --> 03:15:39,730
There's a guards, didn't they have surveillance?

2398
03:15:40,810 --> 03:15:42,590
I think it's safer if you know less.

2399
03:15:44,790 --> 03:15:46,590
Why does everyone always treat me like a child?

2400
03:15:47,370 --> 03:15:48,870
Because you're 19!

2401
03:15:49,990 --> 03:15:52,650
Bro, you can't even drink in America!

2402
03:15:53,330 --> 03:15:57,790
According to what Peter said, the number of cards and chips
in the following game is very important.

2403
03:15:57,790 --> 03:16:05,810
but with the current discard pile on the big screen and the
cards of existing players i don't have an advantage i think

2404
03:16:05,810 --> 03:16:14,030
i need to have a private bet to get more he was on the dark
web though dokey monkey had to give him the welcome to

2405
03:16:14,030 --> 03:16:22,790

2408
03:16:52,720 --> 03:16:58,740

started and he didn't spend any at the bar he also has a lot

2409
03:16:58,740 --> 03:17:07,320
of He is a big fish besides Rick used to be a gambler If I
use my chips as bait, I think he'll be willing to bet with

2410
03:17:07,320 --> 03:17:08,180
me.

2411
03:17:08,560 --> 03:17:11,740
All right I'm lucky to be back alive tonight.

2412
03:17:12,460 --> 03:17:15,800
Hey, Rick, would you like to play a game with me to
celebrate my survival?

2413

Yeah, let's yeah, let's let's do it.

You don't want to bet with me?

03:17:32,360 --> 03:17:33,140
How about that?

2419
03:17:37,410 --> 03:17:39,970

2420
03:17:40,290 --> 03:17:44,210

Oh, that's 16.

2426

2428
03:18:30,450 --> 03:18:31,410
Oh, shit.

03:18:35,570 --> 03:18:38,870
Oh, I got too greedy, guys.

2430
03:18:39,010 --> 03:18:39,810
You lose, kid.

2431
03:18:40,290 --> 03:18:40,830
Oh, no.

2432
03:18:43,720 --> 03:18:46,000
You brought this on yourself.

lucas Oh, wait, I lose regardless, guys.

2436
03:19:19,140 --> 03:19:21,100
I don't think we should have gambled with Rick.

2437
03:19:21,240 --> 03:19:24,040
And now you gotta pay the price for getting caught cheating.

2438
03:19:24,600 --> 03:19:26,900
Jack has less than two cards in hand, so he is out.

2439
03:19:26,920 --> 03:19:27,340
No!

2440
03:19:28,640 --> 03:19:30,740
He's so resourceful!

2441
03:19:30,960 --> 03:19:33,620
He's been on the streets, guys.

2442
03:19:35,260 --> 03:19:37,080
He's been on the streets.

2443
03:19:37,200 --> 03:19:39,740
I just can't play Blackjack with him.

2444
03:19:41,720 --> 03:19:43,040
Wait, maybe it's this.

2445
03:19:45,200 --> 03:19:45,560
Okay.

2446
03:19:47,020 --> 03:19:48,120
I've got 10.

2447
03:19:50,180 --> 03:19:51,620
Okay, it doesn't matter.

2448
03:19:52,920 --> 03:19:55,060
It doesn't fucking matter.

2449
03:19:59,400 --> 03:20:00,780
Okay, we gotta go back.

2450
03:20:01,200 --> 03:20:01,760
Oh, shit.

2451
03:20:03,660 --> 03:20:04,660
Okay, I'll just do that.

2452
03:20:04,720 --> 03:20:06,140
And then I'll go back to story that.

2453
03:20:06,280 --> 03:20:08,300
Okay, we gotta go here.

2454
03:20:10,480 --> 03:20:11,320
Oh, it's Skipper.

2455
03:20:12,720 --> 03:20:13,160
Skipper.

2456
03:20:13,480 --> 03:20:14,820
Okay, we gotta challenge Ada.

2457
03:20:14,980 --> 03:20:16,920
The other ones said that Anna and Ada are very dangerous.

2458
03:20:17,020 --> 03:20:24,180
Ada has a habit of stealing according to this inference the
person who stole Lucas and Smith's oh there's her kids Ada

2459
03:20:24,180 --> 03:20:31,620
so if I win her chips and cards it should be a great all

03:21:53,170 --> 03:21:53,170
Okay.

2474
03:21:54,350 --> 03:21:55,050
You know what?

2475
03:21:57,130 --> 03:21:57,330
We.

2476
03:21:58,090 --> 03:21:58,910
Hit me.

2477
03:21:59,370 --> 03:22:00,150
I'll be greedy.

2478
03:22:03,010 --> 03:22:05,870
There's no way it's going to be another fucking 10, like
last time.

2479
03:22:05,990 --> 03:22:07,470
It's going to be the same, too, isn't it?

2480
03:22:07,890 --> 03:22:08,950
Oh, my God.

2481
03:22:09,230 --> 03:22:10,430
It's literally the same.

2482
03:22:10,850 --> 03:22:11,150
What?

2483
03:22:13,150 --> 03:22:15,030
Looks like luck isn't in your favor, Romeo.

2484
03:22:16,070 --> 03:22:16,970
Say goodbye to your lover.

2485
03:22:17,610 --> 03:22:19,150
Jack has less than two coins.

2486
03:22:19,150 --> 03:22:20,590
Oh, my God.

2487
03:22:22,530 --> 03:22:24,310
I think we have to cheat.

2488
03:22:25,950 --> 03:22:27,070
We have to cheat.

2489
03:22:27,290 --> 03:22:29,370
I don't think...

2490
03:22:29,370 --> 03:22:30,250
Wait, wait.

2491
03:22:30,890 --> 03:22:31,950
Does she have less than me?

2492
03:22:33,190 --> 03:22:33,610
Stay.

2493
03:22:34,230 --> 03:22:35,010
Oh my god.

2494
03:22:35,250 --> 03:22:35,550
Oh my god.

2495
03:22:35,650 --> 03:22:36,370
She had less than me.

2496
03:22:36,530 --> 03:22:37,950
She actually had less than me.

2497
03:22:40,230 --> 03:22:40,650
Let's go.

2498
03:22:40,750 --> 03:22:41,930
I didn't even need a cheat.

2499
03:22:42,130 --> 03:22:42,550
Goodbye.

2500
03:22:45,290 --> 03:22:47,470
I saw her photo of you and your kids.

2501
03:22:47,930 --> 03:22:50,710
And I'm still gonna take your cards apparently.

2502
03:22:50,710 --> 03:22:52,870
Gotta please my women.

2503
03:22:53,050 --> 03:23:07,500
You know, it's very hard to please We have it you weren't
this pitiful when you stole Lucas's words you murder you

2504
03:23:07,500 --> 03:23:08,430
deserve this

2505
03:23:11,960 --> 03:23:26,220
Goodbye, she killed magic man wait we found out she killed
magic man was right she was the one who killed them oh my

2506
03:23:26,220 --> 03:23:32,140
god okay she deserved it she killed magic man between my
father and the conrad family must have something to do with

2507
03:23:32,140 --> 03:23:38,980
the solomon family history the comic book published by
edward conrad back then should tell you about the cruel

2508
03:23:38,980 --> 03:23:47,260
battle a thousand years ago now the conrad family is still
doing all kinds of evil impersonating game designers and

2509
03:23:47,260 --> 03:23:55,600
innocent people to make money the video just glitch for no
reason starting wars the solomon family are all the

2510
03:23:55,600 --> 03:24:03,640
persecuted oh there you go the conrad family just had didn't
have enough footage for the loot now the evidence i got in

2511
03:24:03,640 --> 03:24:10,360
the cellar is very crucial once the criminal evidence are
handed over to the political opponents of the conrad family

2512
03:24:10,360 --> 03:24:20,920
the conrad family will surely be defeated so i must take the
evidence impersonating game designers and starting wars do

2513
03:24:20,920 --> 03:24:26,020
the worst things you can do that's for sure We must ensure
George's safety.

2514
03:24:31,130 --> 03:24:32,250
And how would I...

2515
03:24:32,250 --> 03:24:33,190
Okay, okay.

2516
03:24:41,990 --> 03:24:42,950
This

2517
03:24:47,680 --> 03:24:58,970
game is fucking crazy.

2518
03:24:59,510 --> 03:25:01,290
This game is fucking crazy.

2519
03:25:02,790 --> 03:25:05,270
Jake, are you sure you don't want to come to my side?

2520
03:25:05,970 --> 03:25:07,390
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

2521
03:25:08,250 --> 03:25:09,210
We'll be invincible.

2522
03:25:19,250 --> 03:25:20,230
Okay, I...

2523
03:25:20,230 --> 03:25:25,610
Okay, I will say that side has more allies.

2524
03:25:27,450 --> 03:25:28,250
What do you see?

2525
03:25:28,390 --> 03:25:28,770
It's like, Jack.

2526
03:25:29,190 --> 03:25:30,170
You should join us on this side.

2527
03:25:30,930 --> 03:25:31,370
Yeah.

2528
03:25:31,590 --> 03:25:32,530
Don't fall for that.

2529
03:25:33,130 --> 03:25:34,990
What the fuck would I join be?

2530
03:25:35,310 --> 03:25:36,270
Family reunion.

2531
03:25:36,410 --> 03:25:39,030
If we join forces, we could crush them.

2532
03:25:39,910 --> 03:25:40,870
Be rational, Jack.

2533
03:25:41,130 --> 03:25:43,210
It's like the super evil people?

2534
03:25:43,770 --> 03:25:44,410
Or like...

2535
03:25:45,230 --> 03:25:47,690
Oh, he's joining the super evil people.

2536
03:25:52,980 --> 03:25:54,100
Wait, why is...

2537
03:25:54,100 --> 03:25:55,580
Why is she joining them?

2538
03:25:55,660 --> 03:25:56,500
You're nice!

2539
03:26:00,180 --> 03:26:02,160
There's not enough chairs for all...

2540
03:26:02,160 --> 03:26:03,120
I'm joining it.

2541
03:26:03,260 --> 03:26:04,460
That's my first wife.

2542
03:26:07,380 --> 03:26:07,980
Okay.

2543
03:26:09,500 --> 03:26:18,880
there are 47 cards in total consisting of 23 matching cards
okay you sell cards that card must be the lucifer and your

2544
03:26:18,880 --> 03:26:22,780
team loses you have no cards left your team if you have no
cards left your team

2545
03:26:26,140 --> 03:26:34,060
wins okay choose a player team draw at the same time other
players will push her matching pairs are oh okay all right

2546
03:26:34,060 --> 03:26:37,220
we just have to match her cards this is a little oh i've
never played

2547
03:26:41,280 --> 03:26:51,200
i'm joining group a so it seems we're on opposing sides jack
all i can do is wish you good luck we have a cheater a

2548
03:26:51,200 --> 03:27:00,900
psychopath and what the fuck okay we have a cheater a
psychopath and a homeless guy on team b and also the little

2549
03:27:00,900 --> 03:27:09,520
girl all right i'll select leon okay

2550
03:27:12,910 --> 03:27:32,500
my remaining cards okay what is the lucifer card wait she's
done kid you got about three cards left and it's pretty

2551
03:27:32,500 --> 03:27:43,860
likely you got the lucifer card now it's my turn to draw a
card let's make a bet how do you want to bet let's each take

2552
03:27:43,860 --> 03:27:53,260
out a card privately and exchange them you get a Lucifer
card, and you'll make a pair, and you should have one card

2553
03:27:53,260 --> 03:27:53,660
left.

2554
03:27:54,800 --> 03:27:58,900
If I win the bet, I'll just make a pair, and I'll have no
cards left.

2555
03:27:59,780 --> 03:28:02,800
And I think from there, we can assume which one's the
Lucifer card.

2556
03:28:04,220 --> 03:28:06,880
Jack, I think the Lucifer card is in my hand.

2557
03:28:07,760 --> 03:28:08,400
Why do you think so?

2558
03:28:08,940 --> 03:28:15,160
Because that card passed through my hand twice before, and
each time I couldn't make a pair, it's back again.

2559
03:28:15,460 --> 03:28:16,120
What should I do?

2560
03:28:16,900 --> 03:28:17,220
Hmm.

2561
03:28:17,760 --> 03:28:22,500
If we use Rick's method and exchange the card, you think is
the Lucifer card to me.

2562
03:28:23,220 --> 03:28:25,480
Maybe we can find out whether it is or not.

2563
03:28:26,180 --> 03:28:28,120
However, there is also a risk.

2564
03:28:29,040 --> 03:28:29,700
After all...

2565
03:28:29,700 --> 03:28:31,360
She would never lie.

2566
03:28:32,260 --> 03:28:33,780
She's so innocent.

2567
03:28:34,480 --> 03:28:36,200
It is weird that she's on the...

2568
03:28:37,540 --> 03:28:39,380
She's on the evil team.

2569
03:28:42,040 --> 03:28:44,260
To win the game, it definitely sent me the Lucifer card.

2570
03:28:44,620 --> 03:28:46,940
No way to defeat Rick is to out cheat him in this match.

2571
03:28:48,080 --> 03:28:50,720
And she's sitting too close to the cameras.

2572
03:28:50,960 --> 03:28:53,440
Shooting cards is rigorous and cheating would be easier to
spot.

2573
03:28:53,880 --> 03:28:55,080
I have cheated gaining the upper hand.

2574
03:28:55,200 --> 03:28:56,480
Rick seems like a safer bet.

2575
03:28:56,980 --> 03:28:58,500
Now, what's the best move?

2576
03:28:59,640 --> 03:28:59,980
Okay.

2577
03:29:01,060 --> 03:29:02,940
I can decline the trade.

2578
03:29:04,060 --> 03:29:04,680
A trade.

2579
03:29:05,000 --> 03:29:05,980
There's no way.

2580
03:29:06,460 --> 03:29:07,780
Children never lie.

2581
03:29:13,520 --> 03:29:14,280
What the fuck?

2582
03:29:14,560 --> 03:29:14,600
Okay.

2583
03:29:18,010 --> 03:29:19,530
Why did I do that?

2584
03:29:22,550 --> 03:29:24,170
J for Jack.

2585
03:29:31,520 --> 03:29:31,540
Okay.

2586
03:29:34,360 --> 03:29:35,680
LaLita again.

2587
03:29:37,000 --> 03:29:41,060
Unfortunately, Team A has the Lucifer card and is out.

2588
03:29:44,360 --> 03:29:44,660
What?

2589
03:29:44,920 --> 03:29:45,760
Congrats to the winning group.

2590
03:29:46,040 --> 03:29:48,060
The losing group, please head to the loud.

2591
03:29:48,420 --> 03:29:51,420
We have prepared a chance of surviving one person.

2592
03:29:51,780 --> 03:29:53,220
Please claim it yourselves.

2593
03:29:55,240 --> 03:29:56,040
What?

2594
03:30:02,680 --> 03:30:04,820
The child lied to me?

2595
03:30:04,820 --> 03:30:05,440
Looks like you picked a wrong opponent.

2596
03:30:07,420 --> 03:30:09,800
This bracelet symbolizes good luck in my village.

2597
03:30:10,080 --> 03:30:11,320
I hope it gets you out alive.

2598
03:30:18,460 --> 03:30:21,520
She gives me a fucking bracelet.

2599
03:30:23,400 --> 03:30:25,960
She's like, here's a bracelet.

2600
03:30:26,180 --> 03:30:27,600
You set me up!

2601
03:30:28,020 --> 03:30:29,400
You set me up!

2602
03:30:34,280 --> 03:30:34,880
Bro!

2603
03:30:36,040 --> 03:30:37,520
How is that good luck?

2604
03:30:37,640 --> 03:30:40,400
If there is more than one person left at the countdown, it's
over.

2605
03:30:40,980 --> 03:30:41,360
Everyone was over.

2606
03:30:42,020 --> 03:30:42,480
Good luck.

2607
03:30:43,660 --> 03:30:44,160
Oh, no.

2608
03:30:44,520 --> 03:30:45,960
We can't all get out alive.

2609
03:30:48,840 --> 03:30:50,120
I didn't want it to come down to.

2610
03:30:50,480 --> 03:30:51,180
Oh, no.

2611
03:30:52,060 --> 03:30:54,140
I thought we're the dream team.

2612
03:30:54,880 --> 03:31:00,920
I got a wife and a sick daughter that are counting on my
survival and on this prize money.

2613
03:31:11,990 --> 03:31:13,110
Y'all can come try.

Explore the horror family, okay?

2619
03:31:54,830 --> 03:31:56,590
What is that even me?

2620
03:31:57,410 --> 03:32:00,530
What the fuck is like a plastic axe?

2621
03:32:00,990 --> 03:32:02,210
No, no, I'm just...

2622
03:32:04,050 --> 03:32:06,650
I think they stopped blowing him yet.

2623

I did it.

2624
03:32:09,770 --> 03:32:11,390
I am stronger.

2625
03:32:13,830 --> 03:32:15,430

Oh my god.

There's no other way.

2633
03:33:00,890 --> 03:33:01,370
Okay.

2634
03:33:02,110 --> 03:33:03,570
I have to cheat.

2635
03:33:09,040 --> 03:33:10,820
That's crazy.

2636
03:33:16,360 --> 03:33:16,740
Kid.

2637
03:33:18,260 --> 03:33:21,360
I have to trade with Rick.

2638
03:33:22,360 --> 03:33:23,360
Okay.

2639
03:33:23,380 --> 03:33:25,280
Play dirty.

2640
03:33:32,440 --> 03:33:35,080
Bad luck for me this time.

03:33:42,940 --> 03:33:44,100

03:33:46,100 --> 03:33:48,400
Congrats to the winning, the losing loop.

2644
03:33:48,860 --> 03:33:49,600
Please head to the loud.

2645
03:33:49,700 --> 03:33:50,140
Goodbye.

2646
03:33:51,200 --> 03:33:53,380
The loss.

2647
03:33:55,020 --> 03:33:55,800
I had to cheat.

2648
03:34:00,170 --> 03:34:00,670
Goodbye.

2649
03:34:02,250 --> 03:34:04,030
We can get out of here alive.

2650
03:34:04,150 --> 03:34:07,270
Please take this bracelet back to my village and give it to
my mother.

2651
03:34:07,690 --> 03:34:10,990
She was still suffering from a strange illness when I left
and other villages...

2652
03:34:10,990 --> 03:34:13,670
Okay, she is not too scared of a fucking guy.

2653
03:34:15,370 --> 03:34:17,450
I prefer you give it back to her yourself.

2654
03:34:19,430 --> 03:34:21,050
Oh, she knows she ain't surviving.

2655
03:34:24,900 --> 03:34:26,780
100% Leon's gonna survive.

2656
03:34:27,020 --> 03:34:28,220
Either Leon or...

2657
03:34:28,220 --> 03:34:29,220
Or Evil Whig.

2658
03:34:30,140 --> 03:34:32,040
That's actually crazy.

2659
03:34:32,440 --> 03:34:33,340
The fucking...

2660
03:34:37,860 --> 03:34:46,460
great acting george bravo george was an amazing actor there
what's going on in there when he got it said there's a

2661
03:34:46,460 --> 03:34:55,960
chance of survival it doesn't sound good don't be stupid
there's no such chance i mean only one one of them can

2662
03:34:55,960 --> 03:35:06,040
survive that was absolute cinema george was so good my
money's I mean, after all, he's competing with pensioners

2663
03:35:06,040 --> 03:35:07,480
and entertainers, right?

2664
03:35:07,680 --> 03:35:08,800
It's not.

2665
03:35:09,060 --> 03:35:09,680
I don't know, Daniel.

2666
03:35:11,200 --> 03:35:12,320
Jack, what do you think?

2667
03:35:15,870 --> 03:35:17,810
Yeah, why would it matter?

2668
03:35:18,670 --> 03:35:19,650
Oh, is Leon back?

2669
03:35:20,330 --> 03:35:20,910
What?

2670
03:35:21,870 --> 03:35:22,510
Back?

2671
03:35:23,770 --> 03:35:25,750
I'd rather stay.

2672
03:35:26,950 --> 03:35:27,690
Wait, don't you?

2673
03:35:28,130 --> 03:35:30,030
She killed Leon!

2674
03:35:31,030 --> 03:35:34,150
How could she kill the homeless guy, too?

2675
03:35:34,830 --> 03:35:37,570
These innocent lives were brutally killed in this damn game.

2676
03:35:37,990 --> 03:35:40,050
The so-called upper class is crazy.

2677
03:35:40,050 --> 03:35:41,370
She, what?

2678
03:35:41,830 --> 03:35:45,830
That is the biggest plot twist of this game.

2679
03:35:46,630 --> 03:35:48,450
That was the biggest plot twist we got.

2680
03:35:48,570 --> 03:35:50,330
Watching them fight brutally as fun in games.

2681
03:35:50,890 --> 03:35:52,070
This killing game must end.

2682
03:35:52,530 --> 03:35:54,030
I can't watch all this keep repeating.

2683
03:35:58,010 --> 03:35:59,910
She third party.

2684
03:36:02,110 --> 03:36:05,030
I refuse to believe she killed Leon.

2685
03:36:06,390 --> 03:36:15,710
balance and control oh my god guys guys i see the light guys
the reaches its end game word this is that this is the last

2686
03:36:15,710 --> 03:36:26,910
chapter but can you make the right cop how do you save
everyone how do you stand against this monstrous family can

2687
03:36:26,910 --> 03:36:36,340
you save your loved one or is there truly no way out the end
game

2688
03:36:49,220 --> 03:36:59,860
oh hey okay that looks that looks good though oh my wait
that actually looks fucking good i'm fucking i'm not dinner

2689
03:36:59,860 --> 03:37:07,700
yet i'm hungry now i'm gonna mix some i bought some
meatballs from costco some swedish meatballs

2690
03:37:16,740 --> 03:37:22,940
oh the fact that they had there's no way they actually got
that custom made they must have bought that bulk from like

2691
03:37:22,940 --> 03:37:32,040
timu or some shit i refuse to believe they bought this
custom made i feel like you find the fucking jungler pin

2692
03:37:32,040 --> 03:37:44,880
somewhere so the black joker is finally appeared ikea's just
so far from me costco's close to i don't have it who do you

2693
03:37:44,880 --> 03:37:56,120
think has it none of us show our cards to others if i say
don't have it We don't even know if the cards really exist

2694
03:37:56,120 --> 03:38:09,580
or not Maybe it's a plot made by the game manipulator But if
somebody really has the card That doesn't mean that they

2695
03:38:09,580 --> 03:38:20,680
will win Yeah, I love the background dancer But look at her
go The final showdown is coming, you know, she's not even

2696
03:38:20,680 --> 03:38:21,520
singing anything.

2697
03:38:21,760 --> 03:38:29,500
She's just like she's just like like painting it too she's
not actually like singing the backup dancer in the

2698
03:38:29,500 --> 03:38:38,500
background she's literally just making lip movements they
literally just told us that we can move freely tonight since

2699
03:38:38,500 --> 03:38:47,440
we arrived when do we she's actually the piano right now
you're actually a lot smarter than you look however i'd

2700
03:38:47,440 --> 03:38:54,100
strongly recommend that you nor anyone else try me those are
cute earrings though i have more expertise i like that is

2701
03:38:54,100 --> 03:39:03,340
that combined come on you don't have to be so hostile yeah
she's actually coming the piano we can all survive this

2702
03:39:03,340 --> 03:39:15,440
place don't be silly you actually believed in those nonsense
we all came up with those lies to comfort ada since the

2703
03:39:15,440 --> 03:39:20,540
beginning we all knew that only one player is walking out
without one billion dollar price

2704
03:39:23,860 --> 03:39:27,180
Since the final showdown is tomorrow, it would be a pity to
die tonight.

2705
03:39:28,180 --> 03:39:30,080
So I advise you all not to take risks.

2706
03:39:31,060 --> 03:39:33,520
It's better to have a good rest for tomorrow's fair
competition.

2707
03:39:35,120 --> 03:39:36,380
Oh, hey, the chocolate's back.

2708
03:39:36,620 --> 03:39:38,560
The Ferrero chocolate is back.

2709
03:39:41,400 --> 03:39:43,340
God, that looks so good.

2710
03:39:45,700 --> 03:39:46,640
Fine, Anna.

2711
03:39:46,960 --> 03:39:47,260
Fine.

2712
03:39:47,440 --> 03:39:48,480
Why the fuck would I...

2713
03:39:48,480 --> 03:39:49,680
Okay, I'm finding Sophia.

2714
03:39:50,920 --> 03:39:57,760
I was like, why the fuck would I, anyway, I'm going to find
Sophia.

2715
03:40:02,420 --> 03:40:05,240
She fell for it again, guys.

2716
03:40:05,940 --> 03:40:10,180
Jack, if I really die tomorrow, will you miss me?

2717
03:40:10,940 --> 03:40:11,580
Of course.

2718
03:40:12,920 --> 03:40:14,240
But I prefer you to be fine.

2719
03:40:16,500 --> 03:40:18,200
Doki fell for it again.

2720
03:40:18,200 --> 03:40:21,120
And I'm really good with confronting women.

2721
03:40:23,140 --> 03:40:26,920
I dealt with a lot of men in my life, and you're indeed very
special.

2722
03:40:27,080 --> 03:40:28,100
Gosh, she called me special.

2723
03:40:28,300 --> 03:40:29,260
It was all worth it.

2724
03:40:29,500 --> 03:40:34,780
If I wasn't here, I would have really wanted to be in a
serious relationship.

2725
03:40:35,120 --> 03:40:36,720
Oh, gosh, see, look.

2726
03:40:36,840 --> 03:40:37,380
Silly me.

2727
03:40:37,820 --> 03:40:41,860
I thought coming here would change my miserable life.

2728
03:40:42,600 --> 03:40:44,300
I can't fix it.

2729
03:40:45,260 --> 03:40:48,180
I can finally stop playing up.

2730
03:40:48,200 --> 03:40:58,020
those stinky men and finally act in the movies i like having
the lifestyle i always want okay you're not acting i don't

2731
03:40:58,020 --> 03:41:01,560
think you wanted to be here i just

2732
03:41:04,820 --> 03:41:09,880
stuck in this loophole and it's never ending and i can't get
rid of it

2733
03:41:15,020 --> 03:41:30,980
that does not look like what that looks like great juice
guys Sophia you are a really good I mean like in comparison

2734
03:41:30,980 --> 03:41:39,300
to like in relation to the others on this game yeah you can
get out alive you can start over and be the queen who never

2735
03:41:39,300 --> 03:41:48,700
bows her head again can't you see this whole world is a
stage all the men and women they're all players in this game

2736
03:41:48,700 --> 03:42:00,590
and in this game Everyone is so hypocritical, saying love
words while holding knives in their hands.

2737
03:42:03,280 --> 03:42:14,120
This is exactly the wonderful human nature all these
manipulators want us to be and that's what they want to see,

2738
03:42:14,160 --> 03:42:14,730
you know.

2739
03:42:17,380 --> 03:42:18,850
All the world's a state.

2740
03:42:22,200 --> 03:42:22,940
What is that?

2741
03:42:23,140 --> 03:42:25,040
Yeah, I was gonna say, was that from fucking Shakespeare?

2742
03:42:26,800 --> 03:42:31,860
Because everyone in my eyes is so real and vivid, and so are
you.

2743
03:42:32,320 --> 03:42:32,760
Whoa.

2744
03:42:33,560 --> 03:42:35,760
Sophia, you can regard this game as your grand performance.

2745
03:42:37,000 --> 03:42:38,440
I hope you enjoy your highlight.

2746
03:42:39,840 --> 03:42:41,100
May you have a good show tomorrow.

2747
03:42:41,860 --> 03:42:42,840
Damn, that's so deep.

2748
03:42:46,460 --> 03:42:46,900
Damn.

2749
03:42:48,140 --> 03:42:49,080
That's deep, bro.

2750
03:42:49,200 --> 03:42:51,560
I've never seen a man so sincere as you.

2751
03:42:51,780 --> 03:42:56,500
No matter how bad the people in this game are, I hope you
never change.

2752
03:42:56,960 --> 03:43:05,020
You must get out alive I also believe that where there is a
dream there is light what

2753
03:43:11,000 --> 03:43:13,500
What is that quote?

2754
03:43:16,560 --> 03:43:20,380
Well, I feel like they got that like shows me a deadly troop
behind this.

2755
03:43:20,560 --> 03:43:28,780
She doesn't even get a real seed and drag a soul from heaven
to hell without a sound then why bother living at all and i

2756
03:43:28,780 --> 03:43:34,620
chugged a whole beer bottom burst into tears i should
probably say something okay thank god i was gonna save that

2757
03:43:34,620 --> 03:43:45,820
was all that was crazy if i'd even get it at a siege he's
the reason why i'm here trapped in this game i'll be crazy

2758
03:43:46,940 --> 03:43:54,900
trust me jack i've got nothing to lose It seems you don't
want to survive tonight.

2759
03:43:56,380 --> 03:43:59,400
If you get drunk, you'll be an easy target.

2760
03:43:59,700 --> 03:44:02,760
Bro, if this script was AI generated, I will not be
surprised.

2761
03:44:03,600 --> 03:44:05,480
Oh my, like, guys, you know what they say?

2762
03:44:05,480 --> 03:44:07,700
Like, AI is going to fucking make video games.

2763
03:44:08,140 --> 03:44:13,380
I, you know how they said, like, Elon Musk is like investing
in AI to make actual full-on games?

2764
03:44:13,500 --> 03:44:19,100
I do not think after playing this game, I think game
developers are safe.

2765
03:44:19,380 --> 03:44:19,660
I...

2766
03:44:22,080 --> 03:44:28,200
I think I think game developers and game writers are safe
right now.

2767
03:44:28,380 --> 03:44:36,160
We will see who end up dead Please Jack I only a accurate
right.

2768
03:44:36,380 --> 03:44:37,380
It's the alphabet.

2769
03:44:37,880 --> 03:44:39,940
You think I don't see clearly in your game?

2770
03:44:42,140 --> 03:44:45,040
Please you better be careful tomorrow.

2771
03:44:46,020 --> 03:44:50,900
Oh My god No, Fano, you'd better stay sober.

2772
03:44:51,460 --> 03:45:03,900
This is all I i can say i'll leave you alone thank god this
was on steam cell thank god human nature has no bungees

2773
03:45:06,560 --> 03:45:20,480
shamu what is this like like deep talk right now i'm having
a deep talk with chat gpt yeah it's actually been really

2774
03:45:20,480 --> 03:45:25,820
helpful i downloaded the information onto my and got into
the castle night for him.

2775
03:45:28,500 --> 03:45:31,480
Problem is, I still can't find Peter's location.

2776
03:45:33,100 --> 03:45:34,660
And without that, there's nothing we can do.

2777
03:45:39,380 --> 03:45:40,320
Thank you for trusting me, Jack.

2778
03:45:41,740 --> 03:45:43,180
And I'm sorry I let you down.

2779
03:45:44,720 --> 03:45:46,060
Peter should be safe for now, George.

2780
03:45:47,280 --> 03:45:50,640
If we have a chance to get out alive, we'll definitely find
a way to save him.

2781
03:45:53,520 --> 03:45:55,780
Okay, George is way too good for this game.

2782
03:45:55,860 --> 03:45:56,620
I'm sorry.

2783
03:45:57,460 --> 03:45:59,860
Like, this guy is like...

2784
03:46:00,860 --> 03:46:05,280
Like, he does not deserve to be in this game.

2785
03:46:05,440 --> 03:46:07,880
I mean, despite all the help from the real...

2786
03:46:07,880 --> 03:46:09,360
This kid...

2787
03:46:09,360 --> 03:46:11,120
Like, he deserves better.

2788
03:46:12,300 --> 03:46:14,400
He was severely underpaid.

2789
03:46:14,940 --> 03:46:16,800
He's way too confident.

2790
03:46:21,090 --> 03:46:23,050
He's giving too much.

2791
03:46:24,030 --> 03:46:24,850
I might die tomorrow.

2792
03:46:27,170 --> 03:46:27,410
Okay.

2793
03:46:27,510 --> 03:46:29,970
Oh, yeah, he's doing a favor for a homie.

2794
03:46:32,410 --> 03:46:34,770
But I haven't said goodbye to my parents, Jack.

2795
03:46:35,490 --> 03:46:39,690
I hope George lives.

2796
03:46:39,830 --> 03:46:40,730
I just want to say goodbye.

2797
03:46:41,350 --> 03:46:42,970
Bro, George deserves it.

2798
03:46:45,890 --> 03:46:46,310
Oh, sorry.

2799
03:46:46,410 --> 03:46:48,110
This game doesn't deserve him.

2800
03:46:49,410 --> 03:46:49,810
No!

2801
03:46:50,270 --> 03:46:57,490
The fact that he's able to act out the fucking axe fight
and, like, now I don't think they had multiple.

2802
03:46:57,510 --> 03:47:06,070
takes for that he fucking sold it even without the blood he
did the fact that he didn't crack my parents are always so

2803
03:47:06,070 --> 03:47:18,390
busy with work i always tried to get their attention but
never seemed to work even if it was just for a moment you

2804
03:47:18,390 --> 03:47:26,270
know one small compliment to get me through the day oh
georgie now of course i realized it bro i would hire this

2805
03:47:26,270 --> 03:47:32,130
man Because what if I hire him to do something for me?

2806
03:47:35,070 --> 03:47:36,890
I'll fucking look him up on credits.

2807
03:47:36,910 --> 03:47:40,670
If I'd run away from home like the idiot that I am, I'd
still be with them right now.

2808
03:47:41,590 --> 03:47:45,310
At the dinner table, eating my mom's shitty mashed potatoes
and white pudding.

2809
03:47:47,010 --> 03:47:49,850
When you get home, say hello to your parents for me.

2810
03:47:50,510 --> 03:47:51,770
Then invite me over for dinner.

2811
03:47:52,050 --> 03:47:54,990
I want to find out how bad those potatoes really are.

2812
03:47:57,550 --> 03:47:57,970
him.

2813
03:48:02,900 --> 03:48:05,180
I want a cameo from him.

2814
03:48:05,620 --> 03:48:07,420
You might be the most handsome man.

2815
03:48:12,000 --> 03:48:12,420
It's true.

2816
03:48:15,300 --> 03:48:16,640
And when you finally make it out of here.

2817
03:48:17,280 --> 03:48:19,160
I'm gonna make you a star, Georgie.

2818
03:48:19,800 --> 03:48:20,960
I want you to take me with you, Jack.

2819
03:48:23,740 --> 03:48:25,140
Well, Jack's giving him nothing.

2820
03:48:25,800 --> 03:48:27,140
He's trying so hard.

2821
03:48:28,500 --> 03:48:32,750
I don't want my life to end.

2822
03:48:35,830 --> 03:48:48,550
just beginning yeah game data has been refreshed well i
don't think i'm the most handsome man i'm definitely not

2823
03:48:48,550 --> 03:48:57,030
afraid of death tomorrow we'll fight till the very end bro
george is too good bro he's the fact that he's able to

2824
03:48:57,030 --> 03:49:02,470
fucking act this out thank you for guiding me through this
the script that he had i wasn't following the wrong person

2825
03:49:02,470 --> 03:49:05,170
if only you can get out alive in the end.

2826
03:49:05,810 --> 03:49:09,490
Tell my mother that actually her mashed potatoes and white
pudding are not that bad.

2827
03:49:10,330 --> 03:49:11,590
Tell her I love her.

2828
03:49:15,190 --> 03:49:16,290
Holy shit.

2829
03:49:16,570 --> 03:49:20,110
All right, Daniel, your wife and your sick kid.

2830
03:49:20,870 --> 03:49:22,610
Brought a couple cold ones if you want one.

2831
03:49:24,130 --> 03:49:31,870
I feel like the longer we go, the more we realize they
started having less and less budget.

2832
03:49:32,670 --> 03:49:34,570
Only because like in the beginning, I didn't even realize.

2833
03:49:34,590 --> 03:49:42,570
realize it was like AI like they use AI for stuff and then
it got like except for the funky photo of the kid but the

2834
03:49:42,570 --> 03:49:52,490
more the closer we get to the end they're like okay we throw
AI in here because in the beginning the beginning half it

2835
03:49:52,490 --> 03:50:00,730
still felt like it was written by a real person oh yeah of
course it's cancer okay it's always like if it's a sick kid

2836
03:50:00,730 --> 03:50:09,690
it's always cancer like of it felt like a real person was
writing it it was really bad but like it still felt like a

2837
03:50:09,690 --> 03:50:16,650
person actually sort of wrote it and then then it got like
worse and worse men

2838
03:50:21,280 --> 03:50:33,600
brothers who would have sacrificed for each other were now
sacrificing one another all i know is that had i not escaped

2839
03:50:33,600 --> 03:50:41,000
and went into hiding who knows what i've ever been forced to
have done to my brothers but ever since have been labeled as

2840
03:50:41,000 --> 03:50:42,740
a deserter.

2841
03:50:50,210 --> 03:50:50,670
You're not wrong.

2842
03:50:51,690 --> 03:50:52,570
You're not a deserter.

2843
03:50:54,470 --> 03:50:55,230
You're not a deserter.

2844
03:50:56,990 --> 03:50:59,370
Your escape is resistance against inhumanity.

2845
03:51:00,010 --> 03:51:03,530
As long as you're alive, there's one less sacrifice and
warrior in this world.

2846
03:51:04,610 --> 03:51:06,390
You are that warrior.

2847
03:51:08,330 --> 03:51:10,110
I am being that warrior.

2848
03:51:11,310 --> 03:51:12,110
I can't even say that.

2849
03:51:12,130 --> 03:51:22,150

Lynn We saved the best for last

2864
03:53:27,850 --> 03:53:30,270
No matter what challenges we face tomorrow.

2865
03:53:30,390 --> 03:53:33,010
I will be there for you Wait, did the voice act?

2866
03:53:33,190 --> 03:53:34,810
Wait, was the voice over AI?

2867
03:53:35,270 --> 03:53:42,110
Bro, the guy didn't come back to even fucking read the extra
dialogue He like fucking checked out afterwards.

2868
03:53:42,410 --> 03:53:49,890
At first I insist on doing this case And I made a solo
request to my director Yeah, I didn't even come back to

2869
03:53:49,890 --> 03:53:57,050
record the final dialogue They had to use AI this game.

2870
03:53:58,090 --> 03:53:59,370
It's not the end yet.

2871
03:53:59,530 --> 03:54:00,170
You haven't.

2872
03:54:03,450 --> 03:54:07,770
I bought this just to show you guys.

2873
03:54:08,770 --> 03:54:11,070
What a I didn't even know this game was AI.

2874
03:54:11,390 --> 03:54:17,070
I just thought it looked funny for us to help because I read
the reviews like so bad that it's good.

2875
03:54:17,710 --> 03:54:19,770
I was like, that seems fun.

2876
03:54:21,850 --> 03:54:22,890
No, it's still.

2877
03:54:24,190 --> 03:54:24,910
Thank you.

2878
03:54:25,150 --> 03:54:25,710
Yeah.

2879
03:54:25,710 --> 03:54:28,730
Literally they're like it's so badass kid.

2880
03:54:28,730 --> 03:54:32,410
I was like oh, I love playing those types of games You know
like bad movie watch-alongs.

2881
03:54:32,550 --> 03:54:59,440
So I was not expecting The AI stuff Everything that happens
here It's like a nightmare I want to end this Because I

2882
03:54:59,440 --> 03:55:05,800
played like FMV games before uh they're like like i don't
know if you guys remember but i played like several fmv

2883
03:55:05,800 --> 03:55:12,620
games before there was one that was also battle royale i was
like oh those are fun no matter what nightmare it is it will

2884
03:55:12,620 --> 03:55:24,710
end and i won't forget that it's been in my life i didn't
realize it could make it could do so much ai yeah this is a

2885
03:55:24,710 --> 03:55:35,390
public service announcement about the dangers of shitty ai
involvement we were the reason why i'm still alive No matter

2886
03:55:35,390 --> 03:55:40,370
what happens tomorrow, get out here alive.

2887
03:55:40,910 --> 03:55:40,930
Yeah.

2888
03:55:43,750 --> 03:55:45,510
I won't leave you behind, Lynn.

2889
03:55:48,110 --> 03:55:49,290
We will leave together.

2890
03:55:50,850 --> 03:55:56,650
Jack, if we can survive and get out together, I will never
leave you for the rest of my life.

2891
03:55:57,590 --> 03:55:59,810
Wait, I think that was AI too.

2892
03:56:07,000 --> 03:56:08,580
No, George came back.

2893
03:56:09,660 --> 03:56:11,540
George is a real one, guys.

2894
03:56:11,900 --> 03:56:13,060
He's a real one.

2895
03:56:13,500 --> 03:56:15,140
He's a professional.

2896
03:56:15,720 --> 03:56:21,080
He fucking came back to do his voiceover and no one else
did.

2897
03:56:21,580 --> 03:56:21,740
Yeah.

2898
03:56:29,730 --> 03:56:33,630
Well, since we are all allowed to...

2899
03:56:33,630 --> 03:56:35,050
George is the pro.

2900
03:56:35,970 --> 03:56:40,710
It makes more sense that we spend the night together, all of
us.

2901
03:56:41,130 --> 03:56:43,050
I mean, Sophia and I, two women.

2902
03:56:43,090 --> 03:56:44,750
I did not realize that I got this bad.

2903
03:56:44,770 --> 03:56:53,030
in another room who knows who could come because I would
assume it would I would be like you know other games but I

2904
03:56:53,030 --> 03:57:01,130
didn't think like I thought like for FMVs you know
militarily trained FMVs I would not expect AI to have such a

2905
03:57:01,130 --> 03:57:09,830
heavy involvement don't worry Anna I'll protect you I just
thought I just backed acting and writing just like Jackson

2906
03:57:10,690 --> 03:57:12,190
tomorrow's game couldn't be fair

2907
03:57:16,410 --> 03:57:23,770
I have to hide and georgia this is under man thank you for
the super chat thank you thank you anybody else i only trust

2908
03:57:23,770 --> 03:57:39,010
him it depends on jack i'm not fucking sleeping with sophia
lynn's my rider die she my rider die sorry the position you

2909
03:57:39,010 --> 03:57:44,110

sophia

2910
03:57:47,870 --> 03:57:50,150
Seems like Jack is madly in love with you.

2911
03:57:50,190 --> 03:57:51,210
Yeah, no fucking shit.

2912
03:57:51,370 --> 03:58:00,670
You're all fucking murdering one survivor Will live tomorrow
if it was just four people you guys are more painful.

2913
03:58:01,030 --> 03:58:04,290
Yeah, she's the six to my seven guys Remember that.

2914
03:58:04,750 --> 03:58:14,750
I don't envy you as much anymore Guys, we're a match made in
heaven Jack do you know where the black Joker is?

2915
03:58:15,910 --> 03:58:20,950
I guess you have it How did you know you know that a long
time ago?

2916
03:58:21,950 --> 03:58:30,790
Judging from everyone's reactions now you're the most likely
person to have the black Joker Even if I win I may not be

2917
03:58:30,790 --> 03:58:39,350
able to get out alive See you guys we're perfect for each
other I want to give this card to you.

2918
03:58:39,390 --> 03:58:39,850
Oh my god.

2919
03:58:40,110 --> 03:58:50,810
Look at that At least you have a better ride or die
Actually, I do have a better idea ride or fucking die but

2920
03:58:50,810 --> 03:58:58,670
it's a little risky after all i'm not sure if the bug will
work if you want to survive in this game how can you avoid

2921
03:58:58,670 --> 03:59:09,770
the risk see guys yeah worked let's give it a try it really
did about the specific plan i trust you whatever the outcome

2922
03:59:09,770 --> 03:59:12,230
is we'll take it together

2923
03:59:17,670 --> 03:59:20,790
Did we none of us bring like take off your jacket?

2924
03:59:24,010 --> 03:59:25,810
You do not oh wait, what's going on?

2925
03:59:27,250 --> 03:59:27,250
Sophia.

2926
03:59:27,790 --> 03:59:28,750
Oh wait, no, Anna.

2927
03:59:30,210 --> 03:59:32,030
No, George!

2928
03:59:34,590 --> 03:59:35,410
George, you!

2929
03:59:42,530 --> 03:59:44,950
It seems that they want us to kill each other tonight.

2930
03:59:46,070 --> 03:59:48,150
The guards or drones won't come until morning.

2931
03:59:48,690 --> 03:59:55,210
Anna, even if you do manage to take other things, can you
guarantee that you won't be attacked by others.

2932
03:59:55,430 --> 03:59:56,090
Shut up.

2933
03:59:56,350 --> 03:59:57,010
Shut up.

2934
03:59:57,050 --> 03:59:58,290
Don't come near me.

2935
03:59:58,490 --> 03:59:59,550
I will kill her.

2936
04:00:00,170 --> 04:00:02,050
Anna, Lynn is your best friend.

2937
04:00:02,970 --> 04:00:04,190
She came to this game for you.

2938
04:00:04,490 --> 04:00:06,090
You can't do this to her.

2939
04:00:06,710 --> 04:00:10,250
Beth, man, don't think of her as so selfless.

2940
04:00:11,230 --> 04:00:15,290
She came here to investigate the case and get promoted.

2941
04:00:16,430 --> 04:00:17,390
I mean, best friend.

2942
04:00:18,250 --> 04:00:20,970
You all agreed to help me find Jason.

2943
04:00:21,510 --> 04:00:23,010
And what did you do when he was dead?

2944
04:00:23,010 --> 04:00:24,090
You did nothing!

2945
04:00:24,250 --> 04:00:25,850
Well, you did nothing on it.

2946
04:00:26,810 --> 04:00:28,530
Anna, don't be impulsive.

2947
04:00:29,010 --> 04:00:30,270
We will find Jason, okay?

2948
04:00:30,730 --> 04:00:33,350
After we get out, we will avenge Jason.

2949
04:00:35,070 --> 04:00:35,630
Avenge!

2950
04:00:36,090 --> 04:00:37,750
But there's no need to avenge!

2951
04:00:38,090 --> 04:00:39,190
I killed Jason!

2952
04:00:39,530 --> 04:00:40,870
I fucking knew it!

2953
04:00:41,250 --> 04:00:43,490
That was women's shoes right there!

2954
04:00:43,570 --> 04:00:43,790
Crazy?

2955
04:00:44,670 --> 04:00:45,870
Why did you do this?

2956
04:00:46,610 --> 04:00:48,470
How dare you ask me why?

2957
04:00:48,650 --> 04:00:48,870
Why?

2958
04:00:49,410 --> 04:00:50,430
What were you doing?

2959
04:00:50,890 --> 04:00:51,890
What were you doing?

2960
04:00:52,350 --> 04:00:52,910
What?

2961
04:00:53,010 --> 04:00:54,350
What were you doing?

2962
04:00:55,110 --> 04:00:59,510
I know I was doomed, but unexpectedly I saw Jason.

2963
04:01:00,370 --> 04:01:02,750
I cried and I begged him.

2964
04:01:02,970 --> 04:01:05,490
I begged him for him to save me.

2965
04:01:05,710 --> 04:01:06,650
Begged him too for him.

2966
04:01:07,150 --> 04:01:07,730
But he wanted to save me.

2967
04:01:07,750 --> 04:01:09,110
He wanted to report me.

2968
04:01:10,130 --> 04:01:11,730
That's heartless scumbag.

2969
04:01:12,570 --> 04:01:13,650
A scumbag.

2970
04:01:13,910 --> 04:01:15,530
He was trying to say scumbag.

2971
04:01:16,210 --> 04:01:21,690
I came to this damn hell to find him and he left me to die.

2972
04:01:23,010 --> 04:01:24,790
How crazy is that, huh?

2973
04:01:26,310 --> 04:01:32,830
I mean, if I had more time, I would have stabbed him a few
more times, you know?

2974
04:01:35,690 --> 04:01:37,470
I did not kill Jason.

2975
04:01:37,730 --> 04:01:38,270
I did not.

2976
04:01:38,570 --> 04:01:39,270
Oh, hi, Anna.

2977
04:01:39,550 --> 04:01:41,470
So I take you with a super chat.

2978
04:01:41,770 --> 04:01:43,970
You know, the game rules.

2979
04:01:43,990 --> 04:01:47,830
You know, if the room came out in our time, it would have
been with AI as well.

2980
04:01:48,230 --> 04:01:49,430
I have the feeling.

2981
04:01:50,650 --> 04:01:51,170
100%.

2982
04:01:51,170 --> 04:01:52,990
That movie would have been made with AI.

2983
04:01:53,010 --> 04:01:58,180
You can only count on yourself in this game.

2984
04:02:01,770 --> 04:02:06,230
I will not let anyone get in my way tonight.

2985
04:02:07,790 --> 04:02:08,810
I'm going out alive.

2986
04:02:10,070 --> 04:02:11,270
Is George okay?

2987
04:02:11,670 --> 04:02:14,710
Well, I don't think so.

2988
04:02:16,030 --> 04:02:19,170
Now Lynn's life and the Black Joker are mine.

2989
04:02:19,330 --> 04:02:20,430
What the fuck?

2990
04:02:20,670 --> 04:02:21,330
Kill Anna.

2991
04:02:22,010 --> 04:02:22,950
And I'm going to split.

2992
04:02:23,010 --> 04:02:32,350
wins chips and cards with you equally of course except for
that black joker but how did she know why did you why did

2993
04:02:32,350 --> 04:02:38,210
you not you slept with your coat but not with your fucking
cards

2994
04:02:47,100 --> 04:02:48,540
okay um

2995
04:02:53,840 --> 04:02:58,960
okay well we'll we'll Anna, your life is in Sophia's hands
now.

2996
04:02:59,720 --> 04:03:03,020
Why don't you let Lynn go and we can consider helping you
deal with Sophia together?

2997
04:03:03,660 --> 04:03:05,800
But you must promise to leave two cards for Lynn.

2998
04:03:10,230 --> 04:03:10,630
Jeff!

2999
04:03:10,910 --> 04:03:11,710
Are you crazy?

3000
04:03:12,070 --> 04:03:12,490
Oh!

3001
04:03:18,130 --> 04:03:20,830
I got her, guys, don't worry.

3002
04:03:21,230 --> 04:03:23,610
I got her to chokehold, guys.

3003
04:03:27,910 --> 04:03:30,130
Why couldn't you do that, guys?

3004
04:03:53,210 --> 04:03:55,970
I'm sorry, there's no way she's dead.

3005
04:03:56,190 --> 04:03:57,890
There's no way.

3006
04:03:58,330 --> 04:03:59,830
When George survived.

3007
04:04:01,050 --> 04:04:02,130
George lives.

3008
04:04:02,390 --> 04:04:08,110
According to the current game design, 52 people represent
the 52 cards in the deck excluding the two jokers.

3009
04:04:08,870 --> 04:04:11,070
Bro, what kind of joke on was that?

3010
04:04:11,410 --> 04:04:12,690
He fucking snapped her deck.

3011
04:04:12,910 --> 04:04:20,910
have the rest of the cards the cards i have are fun no
matter what kind of game my chances of winning are quite

3012
04:04:20,910 --> 04:04:28,290
high according to what happened to jason even if i win by
chance i may not be able to escape but at least i get to

3013
04:04:28,290 --> 04:04:34,710
stay alive but if i use rick's cheating skills and magic
temperature card tomorrow i will have to say you know what's

3014
04:04:34,710 --> 04:04:38,630
actually crazy this ai voiceover can't identify

3015
04:04:42,910 --> 04:04:44,810
Whoever the fuck is playing, Jack.

3016
04:04:45,270 --> 04:04:46,570
That's the saddest part.

3017
04:04:46,570 --> 04:04:47,730
So what should I choose next?

3018
04:04:51,290 --> 04:04:53,430
That's actually crazy.

3019
04:04:54,030 --> 04:05:00,490
The AI voice acting is giving me so much more than whoever
is Jack right now.

3020
04:05:03,570 --> 04:05:04,730
All right, fight back.

3021
04:05:05,110 --> 04:05:07,510
We gotta fight back against the system.

3022
04:05:09,010 --> 04:05:09,430
That's right.

3023
04:05:09,630 --> 04:05:11,190
Not the Jack-Oz.

3024
04:05:11,490 --> 04:05:13,350
Thank you for listening to chat.

3025
04:05:13,430 --> 04:05:14,010
Hey, guys.

3026
04:05:14,470 --> 04:05:15,310
Thank you.

3027
04:05:18,130 --> 04:05:18,890
What are you thinking, Jack?

3028
04:05:23,570 --> 04:05:27,930
This ain't no regular or average war that we're fighting
here.

3029
04:05:28,730 --> 04:05:35,450
But I do think that since we've all gotten here this far,
where there's a will, there must be a way.

3030
04:05:36,230 --> 04:05:37,650
Dude, there's a will, there's a way.

3031
04:05:37,730 --> 04:05:43,270
I don't want to give up on your goals, but whatever your
plan is, it's too risky.

3032
04:05:44,650 --> 04:05:49,390
And if it fails, None of us will be lucky.

3033
04:05:50,530 --> 04:05:50,650
Risky?

3034
04:05:51,990 --> 04:05:53,870
Aren't we risking our lives right now?

3035
04:05:54,530 --> 04:05:58,050
So many people have died, and we're about to end up the same
way.

3036
04:05:59,130 --> 04:06:00,490
Who now stands a chance tomorrow?

3037
04:06:01,090 --> 04:06:01,430
George?

3038
04:06:03,070 --> 04:06:04,490
Daniel, what about you?

3039
04:06:05,270 --> 04:06:07,430
Do you even have a 50% chance of winning?

3040
04:06:08,330 --> 04:06:09,450
You don't, do you?

3041
04:06:11,350 --> 04:06:12,550
Lynn, trust me.

3042
04:06:13,090 --> 04:06:14,330
I can't guarantee success.

3043
04:06:15,030 --> 04:06:17,270
But I know none of us four want to see the others die.

3044
04:06:17,470 --> 04:06:26,250
at the current odds each of us only have a one in four
chance of survival but if we join hands we will have a 50%

3045
04:06:26,250 --> 04:06:32,590
chance of survival do you want to be slaughtered like those
other 48 victims what's the point of dying in such a stupid

3046
04:06:32,590 --> 04:06:42,190
way George it seems that you're just an immature child and
should go back to your mom and make white pudding no don't

3047
04:06:42,190 --> 04:06:45,830
say that a brat who runs away from

3048
04:06:48,930 --> 04:07:00,030
mic guys the mic bro you're moving too much jack jason is
the best you take that back they won't let the way he's

3049
04:07:00,030 --> 04:07:06,390
doing his best maybe they won't give us the money at all
only when you get back to your wife and daughter will you

3050
04:07:06,390 --> 04:07:14,770
have a chance to save them do you understand stop eating the
mic bro if it were your father standing here he would never

3051
04:07:14,770 --> 04:07:15,130
be as

3052
04:07:18,930 --> 04:07:21,270
There's no such thing as luck in this world.

3053
04:07:21,830 --> 04:07:23,730
We have to fight for everything.

3054
04:07:24,870 --> 04:07:26,710
Only in this way can we change our fate.

3055
04:07:26,730 --> 04:07:28,970
Bro, I won't be surprised if they did one take for this.

3056
04:07:31,570 --> 04:07:32,910
Maybe she's right.

3057
04:07:33,490 --> 04:07:35,370
Bro, I won't be surprised, bro.

3058
04:07:35,790 --> 04:07:36,890
That's why I'm saying George.

3059
04:07:38,330 --> 04:07:41,490
Guys, how do you send your team on three?

3060
04:07:42,970 --> 04:07:45,050
Guys, team on three.

3061
04:07:47,650 --> 04:07:48,910
I should do it with you guys.

3062
04:07:52,270 --> 04:07:57,350
there's no way i swear they say team i swear to god

3063
04:08:04,450 --> 04:08:13,590
that's what okay back into the ai system of the castle
peter's ai system is too powerful i can't get in try sending

3064
04:08:13,590 --> 04:08:20,130
the code to contact peter he must have a way that's the
first thing i tried to do but unless he senses that's crazy

3065
04:08:20,130 --> 04:08:24,590
that they like hyped up leon for so much so much and then he
dies to Sophia.

3066
04:08:24,810 --> 04:08:29,350
The auto network should be able to control the receiver on
his colleague.

3067
04:08:29,850 --> 04:08:30,550
Can you do something with it?

3068
04:08:30,570 --> 04:08:31,790
Bro, they can't believe it.

3069
04:08:31,950 --> 04:08:34,970
They killed the psychologist, but he could read our minds.

3070
04:08:36,950 --> 04:08:41,550
According to my observation, the only room that hasn't been
used so far should be the location of tomorrow's game.

3071
04:08:43,110 --> 04:08:47,330
And at the end of this floor, the VIP room has the highest
security.

3072
04:08:47,770 --> 04:08:53,350
It will take six minutes for all the guards to come from the
rooms on both sides of the VIP room to our game location.

3073
04:08:53,370 --> 04:09:02,450
We only need to find out Peter's position to calculate the
time to rescue Peter and then escape through the air ducts

3074
04:09:02,450 --> 04:09:05,070
This camera is too good for what the fuck we're doing

3075
04:09:08,390 --> 04:09:16,530
The lighting and color grading is better than wicked is
fucking surprising That's the saddest part Definitely gonna

3076
04:09:16,530 --> 04:09:26,190
be a lot of this this color comp with this conflict with the
guards This seat has better fucking colors than wicked.

3077
04:09:26,870 --> 04:09:27,370
Oh my god.

3078
04:09:28,590 --> 04:09:28,930
Look, look.

3079
04:09:29,530 --> 04:09:30,110
It's Peter.

3080
04:09:30,570 --> 04:09:32,150
He said...

3081
04:09:32,150 --> 04:09:32,830
Are you crazy?

3082
04:09:33,310 --> 04:09:34,090
Do you want to die?

3083
04:09:36,850 --> 04:09:37,570
Peter sent us a code.

3084
04:09:38,370 --> 04:09:40,270
I think we can use this to find his location.

3085
04:09:45,800 --> 04:09:46,700
We're here.

3086
04:09:47,560 --> 04:09:48,600
Peter replied?

3087
04:09:49,340 --> 04:09:49,760
Great.

3088
04:09:50,280 --> 04:09:51,040
Mr. Snowden?

3089
04:09:51,400 --> 04:09:51,800
Mr. Snowden?

3090
04:09:52,100 --> 04:09:55,360
We can calculate that it will take about three minutes to
get from you.

3091
04:09:55,700 --> 04:09:58,740
I believe Peter Snowden supports AI.

3092
04:09:59,940 --> 04:10:02,760
Daniel and I will be responsible for resisting the guards.

3093
04:10:04,100 --> 04:10:05,500
That's why he's whistleblowing, guys.

3094
04:10:06,160 --> 04:10:06,920
George to save Peter.

3095
04:10:06,960 --> 04:10:08,700
He's trying to fight against AI.

3096
04:10:09,780 --> 04:10:10,900
He's whistleblowing.

3097
04:10:11,120 --> 04:10:12,900
Daniel and I will attract all the guards.

3098
04:10:13,400 --> 04:10:17,120
If we can't escape, Peter and George will be our last help.

3099
04:10:17,840 --> 04:10:19,560
Peter, the guy that's off screen.

3100
04:10:20,780 --> 04:10:23,380
This is all the evidence that can destroy the Conrad family.

3101
04:10:25,700 --> 04:10:32,480
must do everything we can to keep the evidence to escape
from this he ran out of footage guys tomorrow when the first

3102
04:10:32,480 --> 04:10:40,960
person is out yeah what about shabu explain what happened to
shabu everyone should hurry up and no i legitimately think

3103
04:10:40,960 --> 04:10:48,920
they just ran out of footage here there's no way yeah they
did they fucking did they forgot to record additional

3104
04:10:48,920 --> 04:11:03,460
footage making this game oh my god because we I think I can
use this copy of the black joker to confuse the AI that no

3105
04:11:03,460 --> 04:11:06,260
matter who is out, we can use it.

3106
04:11:06,780 --> 04:11:08,000
That's crazy.

3107
04:11:08,160 --> 04:11:09,840
I gave you the black joker already.

3108
04:11:10,760 --> 04:11:12,320
There's no need for you to take it.

3109
04:11:12,340 --> 04:11:14,100
You watch such bad animation.

3110
04:11:14,460 --> 04:11:17,500
Once the system you recognize it, you will surely die.

3111
04:11:19,260 --> 04:11:23,580
Whether I can hold on or not, I hope you can survive.

3112
04:11:25,840 --> 04:11:29,260
I didn't expect Lin-Rosa to sacrifice herself for me.

3113
04:11:29,720 --> 04:11:34,200
I don't know whether I would meet a girl who loves me as she
does if I could really leave here.

3114
04:11:34,320 --> 04:11:38,260
But if this fake black joker doesn't work, I might die
tomorrow.

3115
04:11:38,880 --> 04:11:41,000
Maybe even Lin-Rosa can't tell which one of your own names.

3116
04:11:41,000 --> 04:11:43,920
Bro, why could you get him back to record this?

3117
04:11:45,380 --> 04:11:47,500
I'll give the real black joker to her.

3118
04:11:48,120 --> 04:11:48,960
She's my girl.

3119
04:11:49,160 --> 04:11:49,860
Ride or die.

3120
04:11:52,860 --> 04:11:53,860
They are God.

3121
04:11:53,960 --> 04:11:55,020
They're not coming back.

3122
04:11:55,700 --> 04:12:09,480
out jacko has my goat is back bro just called him up on

There's no way I could lose.

3234
04:20:40,870 --> 04:20:43,250
There's no way any of these people are catching up.

3235
04:20:57,290 --> 04:20:57,590

04:21:34,680 --> 04:21:37,420
There's no way these people have the same amount as me.

3248
04:21:37,720 --> 04:21:40,100
They've lost every fucking one.

3249
04:21:47,940 --> 04:21:48,320

04:25:18,880 --> 04:25:31,000
its source code the AI system is self-updated I'm afraid I
can't do it with my ability I might be able to do it my

3302
04:25:31,000 --> 04:25:38,780
watch but jack you've got to be sure about this if i
transmit that evidence we'll lose five oh you did not

3303
04:25:38,780 --> 04:25:48,380
deserve you did not those shields go down these things
around our neck will kill us hurry up george i'm so sorry

3304
04:25:48,380 --> 04:25:59,660
bro you deserve better guys even though we played this what
we went through with this game the we discovered george guys

3305
04:25:59,660 --> 04:26:05,660
we There is a bright side to this.

3306
04:26:06,240 --> 04:26:07,700
We discovered George.

3307
04:26:09,720 --> 04:26:12,000
Unfortunately, even if God was here, himself, we wouldn't be
able to do anything.

3308
04:26:12,720 --> 04:26:16,100
I mean, I'm going to take a line from the top.

3309
04:26:17,940 --> 04:26:20,360
Unfortunately, even if God was here himself, there's nothing
we can do.

3310
04:26:20,700 --> 04:26:22,140
Peter, you designed the system perfectly.

3311
04:26:23,240 --> 04:26:28,040
I mean, even though we breached the system, it would take us
at least 10 minutes to stabilize the transmission.

3312
04:26:29,340 --> 04:26:30,280
That's not time we have.

3313
04:26:32,400 --> 04:26:43,840
we're gonna die maybe I can also contribute I'm a game
designer time to five minutes maybe we can succeed but we

3314
04:26:43,840 --> 04:26:55,300
may not be able to get out of here alive no no George
deserves to go back and eat the pudding he might have died

3315
04:26:55,300 --> 04:27:08,440
he deserves the pudding but so long as, but even if we don't
make it, so long as we can save those innocent people and

3316
04:27:08,440 --> 04:27:14,300
make those bastards pay, who would have just redoed the
reading.

3317
04:27:16,780 --> 04:27:19,320
They just left it in, no time.

3318
04:27:19,400 --> 04:27:20,240
I'm willing to die.

3319
04:27:21,840 --> 04:27:22,060
Yeah.

3320
04:27:23,420 --> 04:27:28,420
I never thought I'd be a hero trying to save the world, but
I guess today I am.

3321
04:27:29,060 --> 04:27:29,780
Let's do this.

3322
04:27:32,420 --> 04:27:33,300
Let's give it a shot.

3323
04:27:34,920 --> 04:27:37,400
Friends, it's my pleasure to know you.

3324
04:27:38,640 --> 04:27:39,420
We've gone through a lot.

3325
04:27:39,560 --> 04:27:41,880
That was a critical moment for us to protect those innocent
people.

3326
04:27:42,280 --> 04:27:44,320
Whatever the outcome is, we will do our best.

3327
04:27:44,600 --> 04:27:50,160
Even with the last bit of strength, we will let the enemy
know our determination is unshakable.

3328
04:27:51,340 --> 04:27:56,980
Today, we fight for glory, for the light of justice in our
hearts and our common mission.

3329
04:27:58,040 --> 04:27:58,960
Jack, shut the fuck up.

3330
04:27:59,040 --> 04:27:59,920
I just want to hear George.

3331
04:28:10,350 --> 04:28:20,990
oh my god control pac-man from what control pac-man with
okay legally they're not okay that's okay i don't think i

3332
04:28:20,990 --> 04:28:30,970
don't think pac-man is aware of this eastmongston you clear
the stage okay we're playing pac-man now we're playing

3333
04:28:30,970 --> 04:28:48,670
pac-man yum yum it's pac-man time i'm actually really bad at
pac-man though like unfortunately i am not that good at

3334
04:28:48,670 --> 04:29:00,610
pac-man it's not even not it's legally distinct pac-man is
that it left pac-man in there That's fucking crazy.

3335
04:29:03,510 --> 04:29:05,470
Oh, the worst part is I'm actually very...

3336
04:29:05,470 --> 04:29:05,830
No!

3337
04:29:06,510 --> 04:29:07,090
No!

3338
04:29:07,430 --> 04:29:09,270
It's one life!

3339
04:29:09,410 --> 04:29:09,670
Okay.

3340
04:29:11,490 --> 04:29:12,530
This is bad, guys.

3341
04:29:12,630 --> 04:29:14,570
I'm actually really bad at Pac-Man.

3342
04:29:19,730 --> 04:29:20,410
Okay.

3343
04:29:24,350 --> 04:29:26,710
I just somehow always pick Rod.

3344
04:29:32,080 --> 04:29:32,940
Okay, there you go.

3345
04:29:33,920 --> 04:29:35,280
We just have to...

3346
04:29:37,280 --> 04:29:37,860
in a way.

3347
04:29:42,170 --> 04:29:43,770
I technically don't have to eat them.

3348
04:29:44,450 --> 04:29:45,510
Because I just have to...

3349
04:29:46,430 --> 04:29:47,610
Oh my god, wait.

3350
04:29:48,010 --> 04:29:50,170
Wait, I don't even have to grab all of this.

3351
04:29:52,130 --> 04:29:54,110
I just have to grab the chips.

3352
04:29:54,590 --> 04:29:57,670
Oh my god, I just have to grab the chips.

3353
04:30:02,250 --> 04:30:03,890
This isn't even full backpack.

3354
04:30:04,050 --> 04:30:06,170
I just have to grab the computer chips.

3355
04:30:07,770 --> 04:30:08,810
I just noticed.

3356
04:30:09,110 --> 04:30:10,330
I just noticed.

3357
04:30:10,670 --> 04:30:11,810
I thought I had to grab everything.

3358
04:30:12,870 --> 04:30:15,970
These materials will be sent to any host on a public
network.

3359
04:30:16,770 --> 04:30:18,690
Guys, he's a game designer, guys.

3360
04:30:18,850 --> 04:30:19,290
They're coming.

3361
04:30:22,450 --> 04:30:24,430
George, Peter, protect the computer.

3362
04:30:24,950 --> 04:30:27,730
Don't let anything happen to the transmission process, no
matter what.

3363
04:30:28,410 --> 04:30:29,630
Jack, we're at 79%.

3364
04:30:29,630 --> 04:30:30,850
Just hold him off a little longer.

3365
04:30:35,750 --> 04:30:36,730
Who are you?

3366
04:30:36,950 --> 04:30:37,510
Who are you?

3367
04:30:38,470 --> 04:30:39,190
Shoot him!

3368
04:30:42,030 --> 04:30:44,030
Oh my god!

3369
04:30:44,370 --> 04:30:46,930
Oh, they can't even get the blood splatters!

3370
04:30:47,410 --> 04:30:48,150
Oh shit!

3371
04:30:52,510 --> 04:30:53,430
99%.

3372
04:30:53,430 --> 04:30:55,190
How did he fall down?

3373
04:30:57,890 --> 04:30:59,930
How did he fall down?

3374
04:31:00,610 --> 04:31:03,010
We are doing the fight.

3375
04:31:04,730 --> 04:31:07,370
Brothers, we are winning.

3376
04:31:09,010 --> 04:31:11,690
For a world of freedom.

3386
04:33:19,080 --> 04:33:21,400
I am so confused.

3387
04:33:22,320 --> 04:33:25,260
I- Who is Shabu?

3388
04:33:25,800 --> 04:33:28,180
Who the fuck is Shabu?

3389
04:33:30,780 --> 04:33:33,120
Oh my god.

3390
04:33:34,280 --> 04:33:35,100
Who's George?

3391
04:33:35,420 --> 04:33:36,560
Oscar Mather?

3392
04:33:38,080 --> 04:33:39,760
I'm sorry, Oscar.

3393
04:33:39,980 --> 04:33:43,380
You were trying so hard to save the...

3394
04:33:43,400 --> 04:33:58,480
this you know you did amazing oscar kudos to you you were
actually so good you're not the best ass actor in this game

3395
04:33:58,480 --> 04:34:09,680
you deserve so much more bro you two you two ryan hannah and
christopher UN how much did they pay you how how much did

3396
04:34:09,680 --> 04:34:29,960

curious it's finally over I will say surprisingly there was

3397
04:34:29,960 --> 04:34:34,180
a lot of people working on this game for what we just played

3398
04:34:37,580 --> 04:34:43,600
Toki, I think risking the Empress game would have been
better.

3399
04:34:47,120 --> 04:34:50,420
Oh my god, there was so...

3400
04:34:50,420 --> 04:34:56,480
There's a parkour minigame chose to save George in Texas.

3401
04:34:57,160 --> 04:34:59,240
Oh my god.

3402
04:35:01,240 --> 04:35:04,720
I stayed up until 6.30 a.m.

3403
04:35:04,740 --> 04:35:13,860
for and it was worth it thank you for the super chat thank
you thank you so much thank you welcome to the tomato 5

3404
04:35:13,860 --> 04:35:34,000
welcome no guys we are not gonna check the abdullah solomon

3405
04:35:34,000 --> 04:35:39,140
had a fucking big Holy shit!

3406
04:35:39,500 --> 04:35:41,500
Jack, what's the guy?

3407
04:35:42,060 --> 04:35:44,140
The guy that taught him?

3408
04:35:44,160 --> 04:35:44,900
Ni hao.

3409
04:35:46,280 --> 04:35:47,660
Oh my god.

3410
04:35:49,060 --> 04:35:55,660
He led his family in the warriors of Shamu against the power
of the Conrad family.

3411
04:35:56,360 --> 04:35:59,160
That's fucking crazy.

3412
04:35:59,360 --> 04:36:01,080
Okay, the Shamu kingdom.

3413
04:36:01,560 --> 04:36:04,420
A country that existed a thousand years ago.

3414
04:36:04,780 --> 04:36:12,500
After being invaded and destroyed, citizens survive odombers
and millennia countless members of the swim cap sac crystals

3415
04:36:12,500 --> 04:36:21,640
and okay okay so that's what the okay well we got our
context in the fucking archive wow the lore actually goes so

3416
04:36:21,640 --> 04:36:38,900
crazy okay well then that was a game that has to be the most
wild game i've ever played i've managed to trick myself into

3417
04:36:38,900 --> 04:36:46,280
playing a, I did not, guys, I did not realize that this was,
I will have to say, I did not realize this was an AI game.

3418
04:36:47,960 --> 04:36:54,120
I just thought it was a bad, like, you know, like those
funny, bad FMV games.

3419
04:36:54,580 --> 04:37:12,160
I did not realize it would lead us to a journey of
exploration it was truly a game of all time um yeah so like

3420
04:37:12,160 --> 04:37:21,200
i know that i didn't i would definitely read the okay so i
did read the ai generated content disclosure and then like

3421
04:37:21,200 --> 04:37:26,420
but i didn't really like pay attention to it so i like
looked at like okay i've like only skimmed through it I was

3422
04:37:26,420 --> 04:37:27,120
like, oh, okay.

3423
04:37:27,220 --> 04:37:33,540
It says, like, all cinematic scenes and character footage
are captured through live action shooting and no

3424
04:37:33,540 --> 04:37:35,140
AI-generated content involved.

3425
04:37:35,200 --> 04:37:36,180
And I was like, oh, okay.

3426
04:37:36,640 --> 04:37:38,060
All right, that's fine.

3427
04:37:38,380 --> 04:37:43,740
And then I was like, I didn't realize the extent that they
went through, right?

3428
04:37:43,840 --> 04:37:49,440
Because it's like a very small portion of assets in the
mini-games are AI, are AI.

3429
04:37:49,820 --> 04:37:51,580
That's literally all it tells me.

3430
04:37:51,880 --> 04:37:56,140
It says a small portion of the mini-games are generated.

3431
04:37:56,320 --> 04:38:04,520
by ai and then and then they said everything else is real so
i was like okay well the minigames aren't the main focus

3432
04:38:04,520 --> 04:38:22,440
here it's obviously the story and i'm like oh i i could do
and then um if you read the reviews it's like it's like yeah

3433
04:38:22,440 --> 04:38:28,020
i should have i should have read more in depth of the
reviews because i saw the first one it's like it's a fun

3434
04:38:28,260 --> 04:38:30,120
It's fun and it's so bad.

3435
04:38:30,320 --> 04:38:31,520
It's good kind of way.

3436
04:38:31,700 --> 04:38:33,260
And I was like, you know what?

3437
04:38:34,680 --> 04:38:35,880
I fuck with that.

3438
04:38:36,360 --> 04:38:39,340
It could be a bad movie watch along that I could play.

3439
04:38:44,060 --> 04:38:50,240
And apparently people were saying that the reviews got like,
um, like review bodied.

3440
04:38:50,460 --> 04:38:50,980
And I read it.

3441
04:38:51,040 --> 04:38:52,120
I was like, it got review bodied.

3442
04:38:52,280 --> 04:38:54,400
I was like, oh, that means this is a bad game.

3443
04:38:54,500 --> 04:38:55,540
That's going to be fun.

3444
04:38:57,360 --> 04:38:58,220
That's going to be fun.

3445
04:38:58,260 --> 04:39:06,260
I was just like, oh, that's gonna be fun if it's like, if
it's like review bought it, then it's gonna be a bad game.

3446
04:39:11,180 --> 04:39:14,280
I love you, Joki, but damn, this was garbage.

3447
04:39:14,700 --> 04:39:16,000
Ni hao, take care.

3448
04:39:16,300 --> 04:39:17,820
Solid, thank you for the super chat.

3449
04:39:18,080 --> 04:39:18,300
Thank you.

3450
04:39:18,380 --> 04:39:19,240
Thank you.

3451
04:39:20,020 --> 04:39:27,600
But yeah, no, I think in the end, I, it was fun, despite
like, despite what we went through.

3452
04:39:28,260 --> 04:39:36,400
It was fun when, like, just fucking going through the
fucking filming.

3453
04:39:38,000 --> 04:39:39,540
It's enough of it.

3454
04:39:41,840 --> 04:39:45,180
But I will not play a game like this again.

3455
04:39:45,420 --> 04:39:46,480
I will say that.

3456
04:39:47,420 --> 04:39:49,840
I definitely will not play a game like this again.

3457
04:39:50,000 --> 04:39:52,580
Like, if it's, like, fully AI and shit like that.

3458
04:39:52,680 --> 04:39:55,420
Because I don't fuck with that.

3459
04:39:55,720 --> 04:39:58,160
I only kept going because at that point I was like...

3460
04:39:58,260 --> 04:40:02,240
I was past the two hour mark and I was like, I can't get a
refund anymore.

3461
04:40:02,480 --> 04:40:05,900
So I'm just going to try and get, I'm just going to see
where this goes.

3462
04:40:06,260 --> 04:40:09,420
And I think at that point, we all know that like, this is
not a great game.

3463
04:40:12,480 --> 04:40:16,780
I was already too invested and I need to know where this
ends.

3464
04:40:17,120 --> 04:40:18,500
That's why I just kept going.

3465
04:40:19,000 --> 04:40:20,760
I was like, it passed the two hours.

3466
04:40:21,260 --> 04:40:23,020
I can't get a refund anymore.

3467
04:40:23,780 --> 04:40:28,240
And like, um, and at that point.

3468
04:40:28,260 --> 04:40:30,580
I'm way too deep into this.

3469
04:40:30,720 --> 04:40:32,860
I have to know where it ends.

3470
04:40:35,440 --> 04:40:37,960
Milk, yeah, milk as much content as you can.

3471
04:40:38,480 --> 04:40:42,760
But yes, you could have just played a funny Chinese court
game on Twitch, though.

3472
04:40:42,900 --> 04:40:43,560
Keep that trusted.

3473
04:40:43,740 --> 04:40:44,080
Thank you.

3474
04:40:44,240 --> 04:40:44,600
Thank you.

3475
04:40:44,600 --> 04:40:45,240
Give me a super chat.

3476
04:40:45,360 --> 04:40:45,500
Thank you.

3477
04:40:45,540 --> 04:40:45,920
Thank you.

3478
04:40:46,080 --> 04:40:49,040
Yeah, but I just wanted to play something on YouTube,
though.

3479
04:40:49,180 --> 04:40:51,680
I wanted to play something on YouTube.

3480
04:40:51,960 --> 04:40:58,000
But now, this game is an example of how bad AI is, guys.

3481
04:40:58,260 --> 04:41:08,220
AI is not going to replace real human beings when it comes
to like writing as well writing a game um voice acting at

3482
04:41:08,220 --> 04:41:15,120
least we know that but like I said I just want you guys just
to be a little disclaimer I don't endorse like these type of

3483
04:41:15,120 --> 04:41:22,820
AI um in especially in video games it was just at that point
we I just wanted to know where this goes like we were in too

3484
04:41:22,820 --> 04:41:31,700
deep and at that point I think we all knew we were making
fun of the game like We were not endorsing anything at that

3485
04:41:31,700 --> 04:41:38,320
like I think we all know I was in all of us were not
endorsing anything we were like just we're just here being

3486
04:41:38,320 --> 04:41:49,860
like what else were they gonna do next you know yeah it's
like it was a PSA about the horrors of AI and yeah I just I

3487
04:41:49,860 --> 04:41:57,820
just wanted to know like what what we're gonna get next
because like it surprised me and yeah not like we're

3488
04:41:58,260 --> 04:42:08,600
everyone like every time a new scene came over i was it i i
thought i i thought i was ready but i was never ready i was

3489
04:42:08,600 --> 04:42:21,730
i was definitely never ready for whatever they give me
should probably report the game on steam for lying about ai

3490
04:42:21,730 --> 04:42:31,870
usage i mean i'll just i mean i could try and get a refund
because like i do not think when they said a small portion A

3491
04:42:31,870 --> 04:42:39,730
small portion of the mini-games are AI And all AI-generic
kind of want to go Secondary opportunization before use But

3492
04:42:39,730 --> 04:42:47,670
that's like And I was like But everything else is like not
AI-generated Yeah that's a little bit Oh my god I just

3493
04:42:47,670 --> 04:42:56,210
realized The screenshot of the Joker's game Is literally
like If you scroll down They actually recreated They

3494
04:42:56,210 --> 04:42:59,110
recreated the Last Supper That's fucking hilarious

3495
04:43:06,330 --> 04:43:13,150
they did a photo like they did a photo shoot where they
recreated the fucking last supper with the actors that's

3496
04:43:13,150 --> 04:43:23,250

04:47:06,560 --> 04:47:07,380
That's good.

3542
04:47:07,580 --> 04:47:09,820
I mean, that's not good, but then that's good for me.

3543
04:47:11,060 --> 04:47:12,300
That's how they got him.

3544
04:47:12,320 --> 04:47:14,700
That's how they got George.

3545
04:47:18,240 --> 04:47:21,300
Please let there be one bad thing about him.

3546
04:47:23,300 --> 04:47:25,460
That's how they were able to get him.

3547
04:47:25,680 --> 04:47:26,860
The fucking...

3548
04:47:26,860 --> 04:47:29,100
The fucking fee in this game.

3549
04:47:30,500 --> 04:47:32,020
Like whatever they paid him.

3550
04:47:33,780 --> 04:47:35,540
He's the non-union.

3551
04:47:38,380 --> 04:47:39,100
Alright.

04:47:45,340 --> 04:47:47,720
I don't know for what but one day it'll happen.

3556
04:47:48,300 --> 04:47:53,160
I have no idea what I'll do with George.

3557
04:47:54,000 --> 04:47:55,780
Don't get the anti-union.

3558
04:47:56,100 --> 04:47:58,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

3559
04:47:58,780 --> 04:48:07,760

disclaimer about it because I like in case people are like,

3560
04:48:08,180 --> 04:48:10,260
wow, I can't believe she played this game.

3561
04:48:10,520 --> 04:48:11,480
She endorses AI.

3562
04:48:11,740 --> 04:48:19,020
I did not know and at that point it was too i was just we
can't get a refund and i was just too invested in what we're
