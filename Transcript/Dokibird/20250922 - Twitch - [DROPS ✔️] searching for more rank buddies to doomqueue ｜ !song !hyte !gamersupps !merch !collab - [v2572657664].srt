1
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,620
Oh, well, well, give me a sec.

2
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,680
Hello, everybody.

3
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,940
Hello, hello.

4
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,460
Today has been quite a shitty day.

5
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,060
So I was like, you know what would make this day even worse?

6
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,820
If I doom queue again in Marvel Rivals on stream.

7
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,000
Yay.

8
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,780
So the reason why today has been a shitty day.

9
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:40,980
Yeah, the reason why today's been a shitty day was I usually, I'm starting my trial period with my new chef thing, like with my new like pre-cooked meal stuff, because I'm swapping pre-cooked meal providers, but she doesn't start until Wednesday.

10
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:49,760
So today I was ordering out for the first time in a while because I don't really order out that often ever since I started on pre-cooked meals to be healthier.

11
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,320
But so I was like, you know what?

12
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,540
I'm going to spoil myself.

13
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,620
I'm going to try this pizza place at this new restaurant.

14
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,240
I've never tried before because it seems to have good reviews.

15
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,000
So I ordered what said was their bestseller.

16
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,300
But the thing about their bestseller was that it had no description as to what the pizza was.

17
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,580
It just said it's really good.

18
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,060
So I was like, you know what?

19
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,400
It's their bestseller.

20
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:51,000
and all it doesn't even tell me what the ingredients by the way it doesn't even have the ingredients all the other pizzas had like exactly what the ingredients were but then this pizza was just like it's really good so i was like i trust that that's it seems really it says it's really good there's no pictures but like it said it's really good there's no way they're lying so it's like i haven't had pizza in like months so i was just like i'm gonna i'm gonna try it you know i haven't had reviews.

21
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,580
I even Googled it to make sure I looked at the pictures.

22
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,320
I was like, oh, these pizzas look good.

23
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,400
They look good.

24
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,280
It's like a dining pizza restaurant, too.

25
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,960
And the menu is no fancy.

26
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,900
You know, like a white menu with just no pictures and just font on it.

27
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,180
Like, just text on a white backing.

28
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,560
Like, that's when you know it's a fancy, fancy pizza restaurant because it's like pure Italian.

29
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,240
Pure Italia.

30
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,000
So I was just like, you know what?

31
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,160
I'm going to try it.

32
00:04:19,640 --> 00:05:41,160
And then the pizza came and i realized oh it's italian italian as in there's no cheese on it it was literally just arugula and the parmaham and then a giant fucking slab of i don't know what the cheese called you know like the little the fluffy cheese like it's just a scoop of cheese look there is cheese but it's like a scoop of these the white fancy cheese just plop on top of it barada yeah just scooped up fucking john it's just a scoop of burrata on top of the pizza and then like arugula and pomeham i was just like it was so okay usually i like arugula and pomeham together but this one fucking sucked i was just like it was it's just it was just so bad i ate like two slices and i'm like no i can't i can't i'm not even gonna put it in the fridge that's how bad it is gonna put the rest of it in the i'm just gonna i i know like don't waste i can't i can't eat more of it i was just it was just so bad i was just not having it um so then yeah it was it was so bad that it doesn't i'm not

33
00:05:41,160 --> 00:07:00,520

34
00:07:00,520 --> 00:08:17,440
non-stop because the enemy team was playing like pure fucking dive so it was Angela Black Panther and Spider-Man and then I was peeling my other support 24 7 like I kept I just like I swapped the cloak because it was easier was invisible woman they break my shield um and then we're it's over for us so i like i like through my i swapped the cloak i threw my like bear like the circle heel thing and then um and then i just kept and then i like healed her not like healed her every time every time we got dope i held healed her 24 7 and then mag ulton i tied my cloak ability too early and then this bitch I can call it because she was such a fucking she was so fucking passive aggressive was like how did you die to the mag old like in chat like like oh my god and I'm like okay bitch like oh I was like wow I'm just like wow you're so unappreciative like What's that way when they're so unappreciative of everything I did for her?

35
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,520
So ungrateful.

36
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,220
I was like, wow, bitch.

37
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,260
So fucking ungrateful.

38
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,460
Yeah, she was so goddamn ungrateful.

39
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,380
And then she was the one that requested triple support.

40
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,160
So I went Ultron, like, during the second half.

41
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,040
And they're like, okay.

42
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,680
And then, like, and then the team played me for not swapping off Ultron.

43
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,240
And I'm just like, we all know I'm a support player.

44
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,960
Like, what do you want me to do?

45
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:48,460
I swap.

46
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,580
Because like, oh man, why are you Stokey?

47
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,160
Why are you still playing Triple Subart?

48
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,320
Swap off, I'll try.

49
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,740
And I'm just like, but I'm a support player.

50
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,900
I was literally playing support since the beginning.

51
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,920
Why don't you tell the other guy that swapped you the third support?

52
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,960
Like, I was just like, why blame me?

53
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,940
The other guy didn't even swap off support.

54
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:21,800
I would I picked support first Why is it my job to swap On support?

55
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:34,080
I don't play Take or DBS the other guy Was playing Take When did he win And then he went Luna Like why is it My fault?

00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,180
There's a censorship right there.

88
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,160

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,780

112
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,540

It's on the 27th, right?

116
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,340
I'm so excited.

117
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,360
I can't wait.

118
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,440
Does anyone know what time it is?

119
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,580
Because I don't put it on the schedule.

120
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,280
Oh, this looks already promising.

121
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,280
God, this looks incredibly promising.

122
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,720
Yeah, there's going to be a Daft Punk Fortnite concert on the 27th.

123
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,460
8 p.m.

124
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,620
PSD or EST?

125
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,420
Or imaginary time?

126
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,040
In the eastern side.

127
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,700
Cloak and Darian.

128
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,180
I'm fucking banning Torch.

129
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,680
You don't decide what we ban.

130
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:26,980
That's so...

131
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,480
Oh, it's...

132
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,420
I was like, that's so late.

133
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,280
But then I'm like, oh, it's a Daft Punk concert.

134
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,640
So they want to be like...

135
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,200
It's because it's EDM.

136
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,520
So it has to be super late.

137
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,440
Because I'm not...

138
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,680
I'm not fucking raving out while the sun's still outside.

139
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,600
That's just...

140
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,060
That's just sad.

141
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,960
I'm gonna play strange after it, by the way.

142
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,760
And the sun's out and you're fucking in a rave.

143
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,880
Look at an angel and a blade.

144
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,570
Oh, oh, no, Medi's dumb.

145
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,150
Medi's fucking dumb.

146
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:57,930
Okay, never mind.

147
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,050
It is a morning rave.

148
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,130
Never mind, guys.

149
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,830
The raves in the morning.

150
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,250
Medi's just feeling like, um, today is 8 p.m.

151
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:05,990
right now.

152
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,880
Your hero.

153
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,820
Uh, angry.

154
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,920
Thank you for Twitch Prime.

155
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,680
Thank you.

156
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,260
I don't know.

157
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,220
I guess I'll play Luna.

158
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,540
I shine in darkness.

159
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,380
Oh, spreading misinformation.

160
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,280
This early in the stream, Medi.

161
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,860
You're supposed to wait at the halfway point.

162
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,760
Also, this is my warm-up game.

163
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,860
I'm pretty slow today.

164
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,320
More slow than usual.

165
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,460
Also, Dad's at the dog sitter.

166
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,320
I'm giving him his, uh, I'm giving him his, like, holiday early.

167
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,820
Because I want to, I want to, I slept in.

168
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,080
Um, the dog sitter took him at 10.30 a.m.

169
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,000
And then I...

170
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,360
After I gave him to the dog sitter, I woke up at 4 p.m.

171
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,480
I need to catch up my sleep that I have a lot of sleep that I need to catch up on.

172
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,940
So I like, I gave him a...

173
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,760
Technically, I gave myself a three-day vacation.

174
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,200
That's not how it works.

175
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,560
I was just like, I need this.

176
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,640
All right.

177
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,160
He's been...

178
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,600
He's been a little too needy.

179
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,880
Oh, TP time.

180
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,500
I needed this.

181
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,760
Okay, I just realized I didn't adjust my rival's volume, so it might be super loud.

182
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,060
Oh my god, I missed.

183
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,580
Oh my god, I'm so sad.

184
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,720
I actually missed.

185
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,860
Guys, I told you this is a wormhole.

186
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,620
Oh my god, if I hit that he's dead.

187
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,700
I'm so sad I actually missed that.

188
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,840
I'm so sad.

189
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:08,640
That was actually so free I know guys I told you it was warm-up And also why did it require me to hit him?

190
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,170
There's six of us

191
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,560
There I killed him

192
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,940
At least.

193
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,940
Okay, I'm sorry the game's too loud.

194
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,140
I don't know what the volume is right now for this.

195
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:27,980
I actually didn't.

196
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,680
Wait, where?

197
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,680
Is this their side?

198
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,520
This is their side.

199
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,760
We have three sub- Oh.

200
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,020
It's my bad.

201
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,360
This is my bad.

202
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,480
That was such a bad play on you.

203
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,880
Yeah, no shit.

204
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,200
Like, you're our only take.

205
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,400
Oh.

206
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,720
We have Jeff.

207
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,060
Maybe if we're lucky, Jeff would like.

208
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,020
There you go.

209
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,060
You guys don't have anything.

210
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,120
Very, very careful.

211
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,880
Don't worry, I'm here.

212
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,820
We have an ult.

213
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,380
Alright!

214
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:56,860
Alright!

215
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:00,980
There we go.

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,600
I did it!

217
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,160
Punisher, Punisher, Punisher, Punisher.

218
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,140
Please, I have to reload.

219
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,100
It can't just be me.

220
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,280
There we go.

221
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,560
I didn't miss, guys.

222
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,180
See, look at that.

223
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,980
Sorry about that, guys.

224
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,320
Okay, I was gonna say, are we really gonna let the Phoenix die?

225
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:14,840
Alright.

226
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,800

00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,060
that was really stupid of me to go.

229
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,960
I thought he would like not see me.

230
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,940
That's why all right Let me fix this.

231
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,680
I just went straight.

232
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:27,920
Yeah.

233
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,520
Oh my god.

234
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,300
It's very loud.

235
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:42,780
This is a lot louder than it's supposed to be I'm sorry The game is very loud Then what it should be I don't even know if we'll be able to see all right.

236
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,960
I'm trying to look I know it is louder.

237
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:45,660
Yeah

238
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,700
I hope it wasn't too loud.

239
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,660
I hope it wasn't too loud, yes.

240
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,960
I fixed it.

241
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,300
No, I just get on that account and, like, just think name works.

242
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,840
Uh, there you go.

243
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:01,660
What?

244
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,140
No.

245
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,760
It was that bad, thank God.

246
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,180
Yay.

247
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,060
Alright, I fixed it, though.

248
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,000
It was, like, three tiers higher than it should be.

249
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,280
It was, like, 11.0, and I usually put rivals at 15.

250
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,180
Yeah.

251
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,780
Oh my gosh.

252
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,180
This is why you don't stand in the portal right away.

253
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,940
This is exactly why, guys.

254
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,840
We stack.

255
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,860
Oh, nice.

256
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,960
Okay, we don't need a stack.

257
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,460
Okay, we just... Okay.

258
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,400
I guess we don't stack.

259
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,980
Guys, I guess we don't stack.

260
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,200
Oh, that's silly.

261
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,420
Silly me.

262
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,020
Silly me for thinking that we're a team.

263
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,700
Silly me.

264
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,840
That portal is so good at the start of every match.

265
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,540
Silly me.

266
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,560
I'm so stupid for thinking that.

267
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,400
For thinking this is a team game.

268
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,740
This is like everyone for themselves, right?

269
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,660
Oh, yep, that's right.

270
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,200
Oh, there's every man for themselves, stupid shark.

271
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,940
That's fucking right.

272
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,680
Please, please.

273
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,000
Oh, my God.

274
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,540
The only team player left in this lobby.

275
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,060
All right, we're dead.

276
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,120
Oh, my God.

277
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,200
We're alive.

278
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,000
That's crazy.

279
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,900
Actually, the stew is actually the only...

280
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,940
Oh, that's right, Shark.

281
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,540
You're not welcome on this table.

282
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,400
Oh, sack!

283
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,140
We sack!

284
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:08,800
We sack!

285
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:08,920
We sack!

286
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,640
We sack!

287
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,520
That's right!

288
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,620
You're not welcome on this table, Shark!

289
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,300
You're not allowed to sit with us.

290
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,160
This chip isn't allowed to sit with me and Sue.

291
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,440
Because you didn't put on the swimsuit skin.

292
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,500
That's on you.

293
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,220
You didn't get the memo.

294
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,360
It's summer still.

295
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,660
It's summer forever.

296
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,080
It's his own fault for not putting on the summer skin.

297
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,740
That's lucky, right?

298
00:23:49,480 --> 00:24:15,320
it's summer forever we can live no we can't she didn't get the memo all right

299
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,220
Wasn't that the mean girl quote?

300
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,640
I haven't watched mean girl in a long, long time.

301
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,180
Not yet.

302
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,460
Jeff is going into my burn book.

303
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,200
Wait, I think I know what they're Spidey.

304
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,400
They're Spidey's like famous or something as well.

305
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,680
They're famous.

306
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,860
Who the fuck are these people?

307
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,580
They're locked in, bro.

308
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,820
If I don't know you, you're not famous.

309
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,560
That's the way.

310
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,560
No, Spidey's top love.

311
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,140
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

312
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,360
No, you're not.

313
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,700
You're not because I'm a hero.

314
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,980
I'm still a hero.

315
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,440
Oh my god, please.

316
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,360
Mag, I'm next to you!

317
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,540
What do you mean?

318
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,040
I'm next to you.

319
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,140
I don't understand.

320
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,320
I am ready to put on a show.

321
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,700
It's okay.

322
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,420
Things will be fine.

323
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,220
I'm a little scared.

324
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,380
I hear the spider man.

325
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,720
Oh my god.

326
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:41,880
It's fine.

327
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,540
It's fine.

328
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,060
I don't know who the fuck I killed just now.

329
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,520
Please, please!

330
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,720
There we go.

331
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,640
Wait, okay.

332
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:55,580
Yay.

333
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,880
We did it.

334
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,360
I would have discovered the accounts.

335
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,640
I got the mutant.

336
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,960
That's all that matters.

337
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,060
Okay, that warm-up over.

338
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,310
I did it.

339
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,610
We play triple support.

340
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,230
Got the mutant.

341
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,010
Dave, I'm not sad anymore.

342
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,790
has been improved.

343
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,310
Day is now optimal.

344
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:33,830
I got them, unit.

345
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,760
It's just that easy.

346
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,500
Alright, now I can roleplay with the roleplay with the kids.

347
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,980
fellow children.

348
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,700
Would you like to roleplay?

349
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,100
Hello.

350
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,080

Whoa.

355
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,540

Yeah.

357
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,800
Oh, you don't sit down.

358
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,820
That's right.

359
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,900
Don't sit down.

360
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:13,440
Yeah.

She's here.

362
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,120
She's here for a dinner and a show.

363
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,440
She knows what she was.

364
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,280
That's right, you want to join in, Johnny?

365
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,720
Come on, Johnny, get over here.

366
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,140
Shoot.

367
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,000
Whoa.

368
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,240
She likes what she sees, and she knows.

369
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,500
Oh, man.

370
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,200
Oh, shit.

371
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

372
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:47,800
Let me hear.

373
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,040
Don't worry, girl.

374
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:50,280
Damn.

375
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,340
Whoa, wait.

376
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,820
Oh, wait.

377
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,880
Bro is watching his sister get a laugh dance.

378
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,220
I just can't do this.

379
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,220
It's just too hard.

380
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:09,860
What?

381
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,220
I just got here.

382
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,420
Just uninstall.

383
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,040
Alright, we don't want to play.

384
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,180
Are we winning, son?

385
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,780
I won my first game.

386
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,080
I've already.

387
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,540
peaked.

388
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,140
Yeah, dude is already crashing out.

389
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,360
I just got here.

390
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,560
It's already crashing out.

391
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,400
Poor guy.

392
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,300
Hmm.

393
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:45,840
Yeah, I bought the... I gave in and bought the Mantis.

394
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,480
I bought the Battle Pass for the Mantis skin.

395
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,400
Because, like, it's legitimately...

396
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,980
I own zero Mantis skins.

397
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:57,340
In the summer Mantis skin is, like, literally the only one that actually, like...

398
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:06,420
I personally don't like any of the other mantis skins The the summer one was actually the best they've ever done And I was just like, you know what?

399
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:18,680

402
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,580
what can we do?

403
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,840
It's the strongest cop.

404
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,540
There's like nothing we can really do.

405
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,680
Also, I feel like servers are extra laggy today.

406
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,900
I'm not sure if it's that.

407
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,500
Okay, I don't like how we're just going left.

408
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,540
I live, right?

409
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,520
Save the Jeff!

410
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,440
Oh, we did not save him.

411
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,000
That's very unlucky.

412
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,620
Alright, don't worry.

413
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,800
I decided to use it because I don't trust my team.

414
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,460
I have trust issues.

415
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,180
Hey, can we kill the thing?

416
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,780
Can we kill him too?

417
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,860
Thank you.

418
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,700
See, we're alive.

419
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,220
Jeff, my boy.

420
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,680
Are they still triple tank?

421
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,200
They are.

422
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:01,600
What the?

423
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,980
They have no DPS players.

424
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,660
They have one actually.

425
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,420
Why don't just go triple support?

426
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,100
You're gonna go triple take.

427
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,240
Hey.

428
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,160
Just go triple support and then make us hate our lives, I guess.

429
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,560
Might as well just go full cancer comp.

430
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,680
Honestly.

431
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,980
Why are you guys going toward our left?

432
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,740
You're going right.

433
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,540
Hello, I'm scared.

434
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,640
Come back and feeding.

435
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,640
Hello, guy.

436
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,400
I don't think he's feeding no more.

437
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,680
That's unlucky.

438
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,000
That's unlucky.

439
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,700
And we got 96.

440
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,200
That's good.

441
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,400
Alright, we go in.

442
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,300
What's stack?

443
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,100
There's stacking.

444
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:58,730
Alright.

445
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,530
I'm going in.

446
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,810
I'll go last because I'm the most scared.

447
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,030
I'm the most squishy.

448
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,370
I'm literally just a woman.

449
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:11,270
There's a shark and a robot that's less squishy than me.

450
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,710
Oh, this guy has all 100%.

451
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,130
You're fine.

452
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,210
I don't know about us, though, but you're definitely fine.

453
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:25,510
Namor?

454
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,510
Where the fuck is Namor?

455
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,250
He has all, I believe.

456
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:32,290
Go crazy, dude.

457
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,710
Oh, he's dead.

458
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,530
Wow, they just wiped it every hole.

459
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,390
Oh my god.

460
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,070
Oh my god.

461
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:43,490
It's okay.

462
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:49,290

466
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:19,510
He just got scared.

467
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,350
That sucks.

468
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,170
I should have just stood still.

469
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,450
Maybe it'd be easier.

470
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:34,610
That was my bad for thinking I could just shimmy around.

471
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,070

This mag win rate is low.

475
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,800
The poor Tate.

476
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,360
There's no way.

477
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,120
I'm just chilling.

478
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,420
30 seconds before you attack.

479
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,060
Get ready?

480
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,340

I might have to, like, change my...

487
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:29,930

We're so dead.

491
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:38,430
We're so dead.

492
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:39,930
What?

493
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,210
Oh, my God.

Like, I don't know.

495
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,910
There's just so much damage.

496
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,550

00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,470
Just throwing it out there.

501
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,110
Oh man, I wanted to make the dot bigger.

502
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,150
It's a little too tiny.

503
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,790
My eyes are too tired.

504
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,270
But...

505
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,730
Okay, now, okay, there you go.

506
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,490
I feel a little healthier now.

507
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:10,310
I...

508
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,730
I feel...

509
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,750
I feel just a little healthier.

510
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:15,610
That's nice.

511
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,590
To be fair, No, I can't.

512
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,770
I was gonna say I could go Jeff, but I'd rather be triple support.

513
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,670
I don't think that I...

514
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:25,470
Yep.

515
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,450
You know...

516
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,910
I... Oh, okay.

517
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:33,910
Oh, okay.

518
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:34,650
It doesn't matter.

519
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,830
It doesn't matter.

520
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,290
I lost.

521
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,030
I lost a great god, dude.

522
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,090
Oh my...

523
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:43,870
It doesn't matter.

524
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,890
The strange just shielded the entire heal.

525
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,590
I should have just fucking killed, like just died.

526
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,070
And we lose two.

527
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,930
I should have just died with it.

528
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:57,830
No, like the shield can block the heals from the Luna ult.

529
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,350
I should have just died to it.

530
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:04,870
I wait here until I get the heals.

531
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,110
It's just unlucky.

532
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,210
There is a lot of damage.

533
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,250
There is.

534
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,650
There is so...

535
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,310
Oh, he's dead.

536
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,210
He's dead.

537
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,130
He's...

538
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,790
They do it.

539
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,870
He was set in the head.

540
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,190
They're running triple take.

541
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,410
You gotta go.

542
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,650
Go Storm!

543
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:34,470
Holy shit, are they stupid?

544
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,910
Go Storm!

545
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:41,470
Have you guys never played against triple take before?

546
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,290
You go Storm!

547
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,150
That's the easiest Storm game!

548
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,530
Oh my god, Storm is so easy!

549
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,870
I should have just been like, go Storm.

550
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,350
Storm is not even hard.

551
00:39:58,690 --> 00:39:59,990
I play Storm.

552
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,130
Storm's my best DPS.

553
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:05,530
Literally.

554
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:08,350
Literally.

555
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,530
Okay, here's, the NM team goes triple take.

556
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,390
You go Storm.

557
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,650
It's so easy, the farm.

558
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,570
You should have the...

559
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,130
I can't!

560
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,470
I have to play support!

561
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,050
I don't know who any of these people are.

562
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,130
I don't even know who to avoid.

563
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,370
It's just... Oh my god.

564
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,330
No, I know who to avoid.

565
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,630
This guy has zero... I have two final hits.

566
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:38,270
This guy...

567
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:41,590
This guy was on... I think this guy was on Ultron.

568
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,690
And he had... He had like...

569
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,910
Two zero final hits.

570
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,910
I have two!

571
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:46,650
And I was on...

572
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:46,950
Luna.

573
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,970
Like, he was getting so pocketed.

574
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,230
This guy was getting a pocket of his lifetime.

575
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:00,190
I don't know.

576
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,010
I just thought.

577
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,610
I thought that they would.

578
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,070
I don't know.

579
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,550
I thought they would have a brain, honestly.

580
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:16,590
I thought they would, like, everyone knows if any, okay, if the enemy team goes triple tank, you go, you go storm and storm moon.

581
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:37,410
or Storm Phoenix Moon Knight you go that's the triple DPS because it's so easily farmable or Wolverine it's Storm Moon Knight Wolverine and they pick none of those characters that's crazy there were five characters to pick and they pick none of them

582
00:41:42,550 --> 00:42:06,130
you do here are the five characters you can pick pick if they run triple take storm storm moon night wolverine uh iron man and i get phoenix those are the five characters you could play and and we did zero of those characters

583
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:57,850
that's actually insane yeah all we had our dps was bucky magic black panther and punishing like we we did just did not care oh my god and i got the freaking i and i got a scarlet main zero to five like they would be like they would be sent back to summer school now who am i gonna banish from this match he was like my entire team would have to be sent back to summer school with how they were playing 10 of us they give a tier 2 sub thank you thank you all right there we go we're running triple take let's just battle all the triple fucking take deniers

584
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:22,970
bro the thing is this isn't even that low on elo i'm real gm 1 is top 500 i'm like two rank ups away from top 500 oh no i put it down so people can see like who's dying so you can see might you can see like my team disappointing me in real time

585
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:34,630
okay valid

586
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:56,030
i just want you guys to know when my team starts disappointing me i want you guys to see it we're running okay triple t the best thing is in viz but I don't want to aim right now after that last game.

587
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:57,170
Is that it?

588
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,730
We have to run, or Invis, Rocket, or Cloak?

589
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:03,050
Because Rocket's the best with Triple Tank.

590
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,890
Just because, like, you get so much heals off of it.

591
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:05,570
Oh, you don't play Cloak.

592
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,790
Rocket, you have to play with...

593
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,030
If you're solo support, you play Rocket.

594
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,650
Because it's the best off...

595
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,670
Oh, well, Jeff is pretty decent, actually.

596
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:20,930
I could do Jeff.

597
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,770
The thing is, either...

598
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:24,290
These can do good heals.

599
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,670
We all actually know we're dive.

600
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,190
We're it's fucking Thor.

601
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:30,810
What am I saying?

602
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,190
Thor's not gonna play with us.

603
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:34,270
Thor and Angela are not even gonna fucking play with us.

604
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:35,250
What am I saying?

605
00:44:37,030 --> 00:45:18,670
Jeff only works if we're a brawl comp It only because we're all gonna be bunched up together if I'm playing Jeff, but we're not going to be bunched up together The battle starts in five four three Two One all right, here we go all you need to do is capture the mission area got it the only issue is that our only damage is scarlet witch so like that's that's the only issue which is like not the most idea oh they're running jeff though yeah this is not the best for me only

606
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:30,950
okay all right nice oh i thought

607
00:45:34,910 --> 00:46:25,000

608
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,300
Oh my god!

609
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,240
I am getting so harassed right now!

610
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,860
Okay, I'm gonna go heal.

611
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,480
I think my cloak will be fine.

612
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,660
Yeah, my cloak's gonna be fine.

613
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,160
I'm gonna let my cloak heal.

614
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,240
Okay, um, heal him.

615
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,460
Alright, I'm good to combo whatever, Angela.

616
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:50,660
That's it.

617
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,180
That's all I need him to do.

618
00:46:53,240 --> 00:47:13,800

620
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:48,760
oh my god where am i there are so many looks that's crazy nobody is running like we're running triple tank and nobody none of them are running the triple tank counter like what's going on

621
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,460
I'm sorry, Cloak.

622
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,000
It was too late.

623
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,160
I'm sorry.

624
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,540
You were not with me.

625
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,980
It's not my fault.

626
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,540
You were unfortunately just not there.

627
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,080
Okay, I just don't want him to get reset.

628
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:10,900
He didn't get reset.

629
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:11,400
That's good.

630
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,160
He didn't get reset.

631
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,040
What is my team doing?

632
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,740
Why did you go in?

633
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,100
Why did our Skylark go right in?

634
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:29,830
There was no reason.

635
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:32,130
Oh my god.

636
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,530
Oh, there was nothing I can do.

637
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:38,530
Alright, at least we swapped.

638
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,090
We swapped off of Triple Tank.

639
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:40,890
That's fine.

640
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,070
Our Angelus is dead.

641
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:42,430
There's no...

642
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:42,710
Oh, wait.

643
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:43,190
He's not...

644
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:43,550
Oh, no.

645
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:44,430
I was gonna say it.

646
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,390
Alright, we have Cloak.

647
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:48,850
We have our little...

648
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:49,550
Why are they just...

649
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:51,470
They're just going in over and over again.

650
00:48:51,490 --> 00:49:08,970
Guys, please, this isn't, I don't know if you think we're in quick play, but it's very, I know it's, sometimes it's very hard to tell we're in quick play or ranked, but like, you see how, um, You see how you guys are trickling in one by one?

651
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:16,410
Yeah, we're, I know, it's really crazy, but like, yeah.

652
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:20,050
Are we getting anything?

653
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:22,550
Oh.

654
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:26,950
Well, let's hope that...

655
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:27,250
Nope.

656
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:28,470
Unlucky.

657
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:31,890
Oh my god, he's actually won.

658
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:33,670
He's actually won.

659
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:36,250
He's actually won.

660
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:37,370
That's so unlucky.

661
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:42,050
That's so unlucky.

662
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:42,830
Did we portal?

663
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:44,510
Please tell me we portal.

664
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:49,090
We didn't portal.

665
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:53,410
Don't worry, I'm coming over.

666
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:56,730
Oh, this is bad.

667
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:58,010
I forgot they had a Bucky.

668
00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:59,590
I don't think they know that.

669
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:00,830
They don't know.

670
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:01,750
Thank God.

671
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,330
They don't know.

672
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:04,770
Thank God.

673
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:05,790
Okay, we did it.

674
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:12,410
At least I'm trying so hard to save you.

675
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,070
What is this?

676
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:21,970
Oh!

677
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:28,170
I tried so hard to save my cloak, but it didn't matter.

678
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:33,900
It didn't matter.

679
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:40,900
I had was, my heels were blocked by the strange, so I couldn't do anything.

680
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,380
Oh my god.

681
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,400
I'm just gonna go Luna.

682
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,540
We got off triple tank.

683
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,940
Tried so hard and got, I'm avoiding.

684
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,260
the scarlet.

685
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,520
The thing is, I have to snowflake the scarlet too.

686
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,780
That's the worst part.

687
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,700
I'm enabling her.

688
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,000
I am actually enabling her.

689
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,880
Yeah, I was like, oh wait, they have a bucky.

690
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,540
And I'm like, oh thank God.

691
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,620
He didn't see me.

692
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,980
He didn't see me walk forward.

693
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,320
It is not even really the pick here.

694
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,180
But there's nothing else.

695
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,320
Wanda is Not also, not really a pick, but whatever.

696
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,720
I need to change my crosshair too.

697
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,300
My eyes are too tired to look at my current dot.

698
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,760
And I'm too EP to look at that.

699
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,040
The crazy thing is we've done...

700
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,660
Yeah, we should just stop doing the combo.

701
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:52,580
Like, legitimately, our Thor has more impact, not comboing.

702
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,240
Like...

703
00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:00,060
Every time we've done the combo, Like, we've lost.

704
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,060
So Arthur should just stop.

705
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:06,100
He should just do it all whenever he the fucking... You're your own man!

706
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,300
You have free will!

707
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,340
Oh, that... Oh, my God.

708
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:10,460
Alright.

709
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,760
Okay, we're...

710
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,260
Hello.

711
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:17,720
Goodbye.

712
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:19,740
Goodbye.

713
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:23,780
That's unlucky.

714
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:25,680
We are eating.

715
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:50,150
I need to remember to At this point, he should just combo with the Scarlet And not with our fucking Thor He has more impact as a You're meant to be a solo Okay, nice I didn't ult Because I assumed my cloak would be fine Also, it makes more sense for a cloak to ult that

716
00:52:55,330 --> 00:53:01,050
Okay, that's That's awkward Okay, that's awkward That is very awkward.

717
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:05,570
Oh, we're dead.

718
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:08,450
We're so dead.

719
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:10,370
That's everything.

720
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:12,690
That's everything.

721
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:18,690
No, it...

722
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:20,170
Yeah, no, that seems right.

723
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:22,250
No, this is actually a team.

724
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,010
I...

725
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:24,930
Why can't they have the Wanda?

726
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:27,810
It's not fair.

727
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:29,430
Why do I?

728
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:30,550
I'm the streamer.

729
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:31,770
Where's my privilege?

730
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:36,030
I swear, I haven't seen a single Wanda all gone up.

731
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:37,150
Hello?

732
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:41,210
I thought by being a streamer, I get streamer privileges.

733
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,170
What's the point?

734
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,770
Legitimately, what the fuck is the point?

735
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,150
The streamer, Difa.

736
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:58,750
Our Wanda doesn't even have... When does she all...

737
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:25,570
I don't even know when she ulted No, being a tank is worse 100% It's worse because then you can see the people You can see how much you disappoint Alright guys Guys, why are you Okay I like how we all just stood by Why did no one body block That's crazy Oh my god,

738
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:31,670
Rwanda got a kill That's I didn't realize that was even possible.

739
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:33,550
That's fine.

740
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:38,350
In the eyes of the angel.

741
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:47,270
I swear I've not seen a single alt from where I wanted to.

742
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:51,930
No, I 100% believe in EOMM.

743
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:55,090
It's their own version of EOMM.

744
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:58,530
Like, they don't have the what we think it is, but they made their own version.

745
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:01,330
There goes my hero.

746
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:02,590
They know I'm already addicted.

747
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:04,790
So they can throw anything at me.

748
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:06,470
They know.

749
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:08,850
Yeah, all my fault.

750
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:11,310
Yes.

751
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:14,530
Yes, it is.

752
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:17,690
Look at the mirror.

753
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:21,610
I can't believe you could sarcastically say that too.

754
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:22,790
I can't believe that.

755
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:25,110
Yes, definitely my fault.

756
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:26,330
Yes, it is.

757
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:28,570
I'm sorry, but yes.

758
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:29,390
No, you know what?

759
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:30,490
I'm not sorry.

760
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:33,990
I'm 100% not sorry.

761
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,990
Alright, I need... I'm too tired to look at my crosshair right now.

762
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:38,630
I need a bigger...

763
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:39,390
I need a bigger dot.

764
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:42,530
I'm too tired.

765
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:44,530
Where is it?

766
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:45,850
I don't even know which ones to dot.

767
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:46,630
Is this one?

768
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:48,970
With...

769
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:50,050
Yeah.

770
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:51,670
It's gotta be bigger.

771
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:55,070
I'm way too tired to look at this goddamn thing.

772
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:55,990
It's too tiny.

773
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:58,410
I'm tired.

774
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:00,490
Today's my rest day.

775
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:02,010
Okay, guys.

776
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:04,510
I was supposed to be resting.

777
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,970
Oh, Mario.

Let's see.

784
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:26,410
What happened to all the Venom enjoyers?

785
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:30,410
Where did they all go?

786
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:34,110
Hello, my children.

00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,550
Oh, there's a dance already going on.

790
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:42,910

00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:45,850

How the fuck was I supposed to?

I gambled.

801
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,020
It's one out of three.

802
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,540
That's the go-to bans.

803
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,240
Torch, Phoenix, or Emma?

804
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,740
Why didn't they ban something else?

805
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,260
Why does it have to be me?

806
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,900
I always lose the gambler.

807
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,440
30 seconds before you attack.

808
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,220
Get ready.

809
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:37,590
Savvy, thank you for the raid.

810
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:38,370
Thank you, thank you.

811
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:39,390
Pretty cheap.

812
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:40,750
I don't fight to hurt people.

813
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:41,930
I fight to heal.

814
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:42,290
Alright.

815
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:43,950
I don't want to aim right now.

816
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:45,170
I already aimed last game.

817
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:48,050
Did my...

818
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,330
Oh yeah, actually, did my crosshair setting go through?

819
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:53,250
I just want to be sure.

820
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:54,270
Yeah, I did.

821
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:55,170
Because it was at 11.

822
00:59:58,430 --> 00:59:59,890
Oh, maybe I should.

823
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:00,290
What?

824
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:02,330
I think I might have to go suit.

825
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:05,130
I don't want to play suit right now.

826
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:08,730
I want to.

827
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:10,070
We gotta play close.

828
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:15,070
If we get grabbed, we get grabbed.

829
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:16,470
It's just a way of life.

830
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:18,370
There's so many agile players in this elo though.

831
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:22,270
It was just meant to be if we get grabbed.

832
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:27,250
It was meant to be.

833
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:28,190
Hello.

834
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:31,030
Don't worry.

835
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:33,190
Hello, hello, hello.

836
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:36,770
We gotta play together because we're a team.

837
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:38,250
We're friends.

838
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:41,010
All right, there you go.

839
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:42,630
Hello, there is a...

840
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:43,630
Hi, there's a Jeff.

841
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:48,630
There you go.

842
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:49,550
That's fine.

843
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:51,910
That Jeff is doing absolutely nothing.

844
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:53,570
There you go.

845
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:56,110
There's a Jeff that's doing absolutely nothing.

846
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:56,610
It's fine.

847
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:00,090
All right.

848
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:02,390
Yeah, I was gonna say, why the fuck are you flanking?

849
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:05,690
Why the fuck did we not kill him?

850
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:08,730
There's so... And also, Luna, why did you... There's so many questions.

851
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:12,110
There's no more than any questions.

852
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:17,690
Okay, the moment I get this, I have to get this first too.

853
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:19,550
Try my best to get it first.

854
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:21,370
Oh no.

855
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,290

861
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:55,280

01:01:56,620 --> 01:02:05,900
That's Bro, he's actually not that's actually so bad for them They're not even running triple support.

876
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:00,720
That's okay.

877
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,660
I wasn't, like, scared or anything.

878
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:05,700
What?

879
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:06,840
There's a Jeff here.

880
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,380
I have felt that Jeff hit.

881
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:13,380
She won the GABA.

882
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,300
Thank god.

883
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:16,680
Alright.

884
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:20,300
She's so lucky.

885
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,240
Oh, whoa.

886
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,240
Alright.

887
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:27,580
I believe.

888
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:32,820
We're 5.

889
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,000
Oh wait, we are 5.

890
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:36,300
Nice.

891
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,440
We're so healthy.

892
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,560
Where the fuck is the Jeff?

893
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,020
I swear.

894
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:43,800
Oh, there he is.

895
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,000
There he is.

896
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:45,800
Don't worry, Luna.

897
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:46,720
I got you.

898
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,260
There you go.

899
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,800
There you go, Luna.

900
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,340
Never say I didn't do nothing.

901
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:54,160
You know what?

902
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,180
Fuck this.

903
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:56,380
Oh.

904
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:58,460
Don't worry.

905
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:00,760
Oh my god.

906
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:00,960
Wait.

907
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,320
Wait.

908
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:02,960
It worked.

909
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,040
I said with so much confidence.

910
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,660
But I legitimately was worried a little bit.

911
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:08,540
Just...

912
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,100
I might have...

913
01:04:10,120 --> 01:05:12,880
been worried but I oh okay I don't think that was needed but that's alright that's alright that's alright but is the shark dead I needed this after my Wanda game I fucking needed that actually I deserve this please please I don't deserve this oh my got hey not that though not that oh no wait we don't win that just i just thought we have alts coming back we don't win that instantly punished i had no right click if i had right click we win that unfortunately the right click was non-existent all right What are they doing over there?

914
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,400
Maybe we should help our magic.

915
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:15,440
I don't know.

916
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:17,180
It's like...

917
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:17,920
What?

918
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,000
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

919
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:20,560
Hello.

920
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,020
Hey guys.

921
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:26,560
Look at the front.

922
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:29,160
The Jeff is practically doing nothing.

923
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,300
Like, stand in my little orb of heal.

924
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,180
That Jeff is like basically air.

925
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:40,740
Alright, trust me.

926
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:45,240
Jesus Christ.

927
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,600
I'm so...

928
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,980
I'm trying my best to keep her alive, but...

929
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,580
I said my best.

930
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:53,320
Doesn't mean it's working.

931
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:56,520
Alright.

932
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:01,750
Oh my god, please.

933
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:04,050
There is, like, this guy next to me.

934
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:07,330
Hello.

935
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:08,870
Hello.

936
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,490
Hello.

937
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:12,230
Hello!

938
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:14,710
Give me a sec.

939
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:17,790
Here we go.

940
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:18,850
Oh, goodbye.

941
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:21,030
It was great knowing all...

942
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:21,290
Oh, God!

943
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:21,970
He's seen that!

944
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:26,170
He actually threw!

945
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:28,410
He's seen that!

946
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:31,010
He forced to see that.

947
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:32,430
Okay, we know who we're avoiding.

948
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:36,490
We know who we're definitely avoiding.

949
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:38,230
Typical chips.

950
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:44,890
Yeah, He's the... He's the double agent right there.

951
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:50,130
And your team would not be happy about that.

952
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,670
Skippy, thank you for the doing your biddies.

953
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:56,810
Thank you, thank you.

954
01:06:57,590 --> 01:06:59,910
I love to kind of keep up with the primetime ideas.

955
01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:00,670
Thanks for being here.

956
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:01,330
Thank you.

957
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:02,450
I really appreciate it.

958
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:03,130
Thank you for the biddies.

959
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:04,270
Thank you, thank you.

960
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:05,630
Skippy.

961
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:11,010
Yeah, that Jeff did not realize...

962
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:15,830
He's been at, he's been, he apparently had to go to summer school, so he doesn't know the new Jeff meta.

963
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:20,910
He's like, hey guys, I can't believe my favorite character is finally meta.

964
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:23,750
I bet his playstyle has not changed whatsoever.

965
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:28,210
He'd count back from summer school.

966
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:29,910
He's like, wow, I can't believe it.

967
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:31,890
My favorite character is finally meta.

968
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:35,750
Guys, darn, it would be a shame if this playstyle changed.

969
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:37,030
Really would be.

970
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:39,890
He's a sleeper agent.

971
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:41,170
Let's see, no.

972
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:43,590
Polly, gee.

973
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:46,530
You forgot to read the patch notes.

974
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:51,650
Yeah, in the past, to play Jeff efficiently, you gotta play Blanker Jeff.

975
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:54,970
But now the current meta is literally, like, you just play the team.

976
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:56,490
That's it.

977
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:58,150
It's literally just a team.

978
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:00,410
He's just, like, like, a regular support.

979
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:04,790
Like, he's actually a support character now.

980
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:12,810
Okay, I just need to save my...

981
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:14,270
Right click.

982
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:21,170
I gotta save my right click for the Spider-Man.

983
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:23,250
Oh, they got him off.

984
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:24,490
What the fuck?

985
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:27,310
He's a Jeff Spider-Man player?

986
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:28,850
What the fuck is...

987
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:30,750
What kind of hero pool is that?

988
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:34,390
He plays Jeff like it's Spider-Man.

989
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:35,630
That's crazy.

990
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:37,550
Alright.

991
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:40,030
Don't worry, I got you.

992
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,050
I mean, that's very...

993
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:44,070
Oh, I mean, that's alright.

994
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:45,290
You fucking aim for me.

995
01:08:45,310 --> 01:09:07,710
the moon night we're both there you know yeah that's basically the same character you know yeah they're running they're they're tilted it's literally one no they're 100 tilted but they only have one support so what we're a team that tracks

996

1002
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,840

Oh, shit.

1025
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:40,670
Oh, shit.

01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:41,330
Okay, I should heal.

1028
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:42,850
Oh, my god.

1029
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:43,350
It's fine.

1030
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,130
I should have healed.

1031
01:11:49,650 --> 01:12:45,830

I might have let her die last time.

1033
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:53,910
Yeah, she watched.

1034
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:55,210
She's like, please die.

1035
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:56,650
Please die.

1036
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:03,410
I'm in the game and they're holding us hostage.

1037
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:09,070
How could they do such a thing?

1038
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:10,690
Who would have done?

1039
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:11,950
Who could do that?

1040
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:16,150
Just like League, for real, for real.

1041
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:48,950
the thing is it's not it can't be like one person holding you hostage it has to be two because they because there were too many elot terrorists in the lobby that hold people hostage like actual like hostage situation oh my god how many streamers are there live live on twitch shroud oh wait actually Saikuno I have twitch I have I have,

1042
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:56,570

1043
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:03,350
I was gonna say, Saikuno, I have Rust drops going on right now.

1044
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:08,030
It's too late, the timing's gone.

1045
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:11,770
Everyone's left, I fumbled it.

1046
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:14,450
I fumbled it.

1047
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:18,490
They invited me to the Rust server, but...

1048
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:19,830
I don't feel like rest right now.

1049
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:20,710
I don't want to...

1050
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:22,350
Like, there's just so many people.

1051
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:24,290
Don't.

1052
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:27,110
Both I fumbled.

1053
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:29,210
Oh, wait.

1054
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:29,570
I forgot.

1055
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:30,770
I gotta avoid the Jeff.

1056
01:14:32,850 --> 01:14:35,470
I won't be surprised if he was the one that held people hostage.

1057
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:36,670
Wait, was it this guy?

1058
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:42,880
It's my rest day.

1059
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:45,500
I can do whatever the fuck I want.

1060
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,080
I'm not...

1061
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:46,780
I'm not...

1062
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:48,940
I'm literally doing overtime right now.

1063
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,720
I'm on overtime.

1064
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,380

1067
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:37,760
You don't want to be seen being like little bitches and passive aggressive fucks.

1068
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:44,120
Crazy.

1069
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,620
How would I farm these kids?

1070
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:50,220
Alright.

1071
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,680
I'm so sad.

1072
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:55,480

Holy shit, how bad are you for body blocking that entire door?

1077
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:08,040
The body block is crazy.

1078
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,120
Who am I gonna vanish from this match?

1079
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:14,740
Torch.

1080
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:17,860
That was a fucking crazy body block.

1081
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,420
Those hips are lethal.

1082
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:28,000
Alright, here we go.

1083
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,600
Oh, you bought all the pay.

01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:34,280
Oh, thank you.

1085
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:35,400
I really appreciate it.

1086
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:35,700
Yes.

1087
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:38,120
I'm at Parallel Collab out right now.

1088
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:40,000
I just want to check it out.

1089
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:45,600
There's three days left for the pre-order.

1090
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:48,320
It's the exclamation point collab and check it out.

1091
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:49,860
I'm adding Emma.

1092
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,320
Just because we don't have an Emma player, apparently.

1093
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:56,880
No Emma player.

1094
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:57,600
What can we do?

1095
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,380

Are 25% off.

1106
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:19,880
Like the moon.

1107
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:21,500
I shine in darkness.

1108
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,680
So it's cheaper.

1109
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,080
Cheaper subs.

1110
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:25,860
How often are you going?

1111
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:26,780
Okay, but like...

1112
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:28,120
What about the emojis, though?

1113
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,560
Okay, but all...

1114
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:32,560
But like...

1115
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,660
But we don't think about how often I'm going to stream.

1116
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,060
Think about the emotes.

1117
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:41,200
Like, look at all these wonderful emotes you can have and use on other streams.

1118
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:46,760
On other people's streams.

1119
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,400
Come on.

1120
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,460
We need to make people happy.

1121
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,180
Heroes make them safe.

1122
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,140
Maybe I can do both.

1123
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:56,460
They'll be coming in 30 seconds.

1124
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,200
She's cooking.

01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:00,100

01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:47,580
Wait, do they also have Groot?

1132
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:49,100
Oh my god, they also have Groot.

1133

1134
01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:58,770
I'm just gonna put on the Groot.

1135
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:03,030
I am Groot.

1136
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:04,510
I like the cold.

1137
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:12,430
Oh my god, he already has all...

1138
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:13,190
That's crazy.

1139
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:17,370
I don't think none of us are close to all right now.

1140
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:19,670
Wait, unless...

1141
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:20,590
Yes!

1142
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:22,290
Oh, goodbye, everybody.

1143
01:20:23,370 --> 01:20:25,170
It's just you and me, I guess.

1144
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:26,870
Okay.

1145
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:28,470
Um...

1146
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:33,410
I stalled it as long as I could.

1147
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:35,670
And then they manned themselves it.

1148
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:38,650
Hello!

1149
01:20:39,490 --> 01:20:40,890
I'm scared.

1150
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:45,290
Oh, I forgot that you see.

1151
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:47,650
What was that res?

1152
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:48,710
I...

1153
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:51,110
What the fuck was that res?

1154
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:51,890
Wait.

1155
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:53,890
I was just in there.

1156
01:20:55,750 --> 01:21:00,010
Oh, our mantis should have saved her up for the res.

1157
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:03,250
I just came in and it was just death.

1158
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:07,750
I was not expecting that res.

1159
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:17,490
That was, I felt like a baby sea turtle hatching up from the ground and then there's, they were all the seagulls ready to fucking eat me.

1160
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:21,710
Oh god, like right into hell.

1161
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:26,470
Like I was the sea turtle that was not gonna make it.

1162
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:30,070
I poked my head outside and it was just over.

1163
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:32,710
I didn't remember to use my atom.

1164
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:37,870
Oh, I'd rather have an ultra than an atom.

1165
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:40,030
Honestly.

1166
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:43,310
Extermination!

1167
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:45,050
Oh!

1168
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:47,550
Alright, we should go up now.

1169
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:51,650
Or even like a Jeff, honestly, because we're a brawl comp.

1170
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:55,670
We're a fucking full-on brawl comp.

1171
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:58,050
So like a Jeff would make sense.

1172
01:21:59,170 --> 01:22:00,570
Because you can build alt faster.

1173
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:05,930
What is it I have my snowflake on?

1174
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:07,310
Oh, the Groot.

1175
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:07,630
Okay.

1176
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:09,470
No, it has to be on the Groot.

1177
01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:24,070
I am Groot Watch They're gonna get eaten The moment I hit that alt button They're gonna get eaten I am Groot I am Groot

1178
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,380

1179
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:40,000

Wait, where are they?

01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,360
Oh, this is bad.

1187
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:09,860
This is bad.

1188
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,220
Oh, our matches didn't have all...

1189
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:12,560

Can we touch?

1191
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:24,170
I don't know.

1192
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:26,030
We could technically touch with...

1193
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:30,530
No, we can't touch.

1194
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:32,350
We actually cannot touch.

1195
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:33,990
Nope.

1196
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:35,910
Nope, I don't believe.

1197
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:39,230
Oh!

1198
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:41,190
That's unlucky.

1199
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:43,230
That's unlucky.

1200
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:53,030
Alright, well, it looks like the Mantis ult's first, so I don't want to risk it.

1201
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:56,570
Because I was like, I'll first and then Mantis went, friends!

1202
01:24:57,010 --> 01:24:57,790
And I was like, okay.

1203
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,440
Okay, I wait.

1204
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,200
That's just unlucky.

1205
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:17,020
Alright, I want to ult for my...

1206
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:17,520
There you go.

1207
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:18,460
Friends!

1208
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:25,280
This is the only way I can feel safe.

1209
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:28,940
Hold the man.

1210
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:30,280
I know.

1211
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,620
We're here to put on a show.

1212
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,500
We're here to put on a show.

1213
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:41,300
And then this is where we...

1214
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:43,220
We have a res, right?

1215
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:45,260
Our Adam died.

1216
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:48,760
It's still possible!

1217
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,720
It's still possible!

1218
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,040
Rise, my friends!

1219
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:58,670
See?

1220
01:25:58,930 --> 01:25:59,750
I knew it.

1221
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:32,600
I don't know we can push all the way that's the that's the only do I trust my team let's find out Jesus Christ this mantis does not care when's it's like I'm playing silk song right now I don't think I can build my own time rivals has spoiled me so much with support though like I actually feel doing something.

1222
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:39,940
I swear to God, any other, if I play like Overwatch or anything, wins!

1223
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,980
It's a big old fat, super fat.

1224
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:46,280
The way I froze him too!

1225
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:54,240
Man!

1226
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:55,900
Keep staggering.

1227
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:00,200
The question is, can we push all the way?

1228
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,800
That's the question right now.

1229
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:06,960
I have a...

1230
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:09,600
I feel like we're so up close, but that's okay.

1231
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:11,800
I like to play with a little fear.

1232
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:17,680
I like that little fear.

1233
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:21,860
You know?

1234
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,820
It makes it so much more exciting.

1235
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:27,440
We're down!

1236
01:27:34,130 --> 01:27:34,670
I'm dead.

1237
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:36,210
I'm so dead in there.

1238
01:27:36,910 --> 01:27:38,010
Oh my god!

1239
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:40,910
Oh, our item was...

1240
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:45,130
Adam, why would you ever, like, be playing with us when you have us?

1241
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:46,610
Let me get back.

1242
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:49,370
Oh, no.

1243
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:50,650
Our Adam can't even up.

1244
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:52,430
Our Adam can't even up.

1245
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:54,470
Adam, you're fucking crazy.

1246
01:27:59,430 --> 01:28:00,750
I can't even...

1247
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:09,470
I don't know why our Adam played up front with Rez.

1248
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:18,450
Like, the moment you have Rez, you hide i i mean mantis team up is it really that worth maybe the luna would be better

1249
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:50,770
why yeah adam i can't even i don't even think if i use my luna team up it would have done anything i would have lived but my entire team would have died i'm luna snow like the matter they play ultra um i'm just like even i'm win-loss win-loss lost but i'm also like solo cute apparently like i was told that every like top 500 player is just three stacking because you can three stack till celestial

1250
01:28:54,250 --> 01:29:21,070

1251
01:29:25,710 --> 01:29:29,110

1252
01:29:32,650 --> 01:29:38,590
isn't that funny yo bro just go dps then

1253
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:47,020
i think that sucks like nobody fucking hits the thing

1254
01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:54,910
This is- I have not seen Loki in so long, I swear.

1255
01:29:55,550 --> 01:29:58,150
I feel like Loki is only viable in...

1256
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:00,750
Um...

1257
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:02,930
Please, you are all walled off, please.

1258
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:06,430
I am trying my best to- My DPS, unfortunately.

1259
01:30:07,030 --> 01:30:10,690
Although they did buff me, it's still not as strong as I would like it.

1260
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:12,390
A little healing to take care of.

1261
01:30:13,870 --> 01:30:15,250
Go to the back room.

1262
01:30:18,490 --> 01:30:19,930
Alright, I reload.

1263
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:30,410
all right let's hope our mag lives there you go i have a portal i got portal nice

1264
01:30:35,290 --> 01:30:49,910
yeah back to triple support technically you don't have to stand on the cart yet because it's odd you'll see that it's auto you can push up a little bit holy holy you're so lucky acknowledged

1265
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:56,250
I'm just gonna make sure.

1266
01:30:56,830 --> 01:30:57,950
Oh, never mind.

1267
01:30:59,050 --> 01:31:00,190
Never mind.

1268
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:03,590
Three, two, one.

1269
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:05,070
Counting out for myself.

1270
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:09,620
Damn.

1271
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,160
Do we have follow-up?

1272
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,540
Wait, we don't even have Maga.

1273
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:14,660
Oh my god, we don't even have Maga.

1274
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,060
Oh my.

1275
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,000
That's very unfortunate.

1276
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:22,500
What?

1277
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:23,460
Did he got Shia?

1278
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:26,780
Did he get shield?

1279
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:31,940
I don't think you're a deep yes, bro.

1280
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:32,720
I don't think you're a healer.

1281
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:33,900
I just think you're pure dog shit.

1282
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,980
I think that's probably what the problem is, bro.

1283
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:38,520
Yeah, absolutely fucking silent or shit.

1284
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:41,340
I mean, you're just a fucking...

1285
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:45,520
You see, if I wasn't streaming, he would have said that to me.

1286
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:46,340
You see?

1287
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:52,100
If he wasn't streaming, he would have said that to me.

1288
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:58,100
Unfortunate.

1289
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:00,960
Unfortunate.

1290
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:02,200
I like...

1291
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:02,940
Are you serious?

1292
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,200
Oh, nice.

1293
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:07,760
We're going to have to kill him too.

1294
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:08,340
Oh, my God.

1295
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,040
Thank God.

1296
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:13,940
I don't have vault for Punisher now.

1297
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:15,580
I do.

1298
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:17,700
Don't worry.

1299
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:21,800
As long as we don't stand in front of a Punisher, we can live.

1300
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:23,540
There's a lot to ask.

1301
01:32:23,600 --> 01:33:45,920
our team but like what yeah me too oh my god okay i oh my mag oh oh my god okay okay somehow oh my god okay somehow i saw like so many things that could happen but didn't it was crazy so many things could happen that did not Jesus somehow some oh we still lose this yeah somehow we actually still lose this I I don't know I don't know how this is possible you're 12 and 13 dude like please bro please a triple heal ultron go go tank I don't know do something bro you're so fucking bad I'm not bubbling you here I witnessed a hate crime Actual pure hate crime right there He's so real for that He's actually so real It's

1302
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:57,280
This is the content I want I hope that puncher is having a good time.

1303
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:03,360
The thing is, we could literally go...

1304
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:05,420
Not Loki.

1305
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:07,200
We have to play Loki.

1306
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:08,080
I forgot we have a group.

1307
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:10,000
Loki is so bad now.

1308
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:14,240
I know!

1309
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:22,300
This is the Marvel Revival experience you came for.

1310
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:24,020
Is it not, guys?

1311
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:32,360
Hello.

1312
01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:39,270
I'm reloading.

1313
01:34:40,910 --> 01:34:41,790
I'm sorry.

1314
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:43,550
It was very hard to see.

1315
01:34:44,610 --> 01:34:47,510
It was very hard to see.

1316
01:34:47,610 --> 01:34:48,170
I'm sorry.

1317
01:34:48,270 --> 01:34:51,230
There was a lot of stuff going on.

1318
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:55,490
Where am I?

1319
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:56,870
It's just all.

1320
01:34:57,870 --> 01:34:59,010
Oh my god, he got a kill.

1321
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:00,090
Go second morning.

1322
01:35:00,350 --> 01:35:00,730
Go.

1323
01:35:03,150 --> 01:35:05,410
Oh my god, he's doing it!

1324
01:35:05,610 --> 01:35:06,570
Now they have strange alt.

1325
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:07,570
Ready, guys?

1326
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:10,210
Get ready!

1327
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:15,890
Did you see that?

1328
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:17,790
Wow.

1329
01:35:18,930 --> 01:35:19,990
It's like...

1330
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:23,330
It's like I could predict our future.

1331
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:24,710
How did you know, Doki?

1332
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:25,570
Are you hacking?

1333
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:27,530
I don't know.

1334
01:35:30,970 --> 01:35:33,630
Oh, there he is.

1335
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:35,590
There he is.

1336
01:35:38,110 --> 01:35:40,190
That's very unfortunate.

1337
01:35:43,330 --> 01:35:44,950
Um, hey.

1338
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:48,730
Hello.

1339
01:35:50,970 --> 01:35:51,270
Hello.

1340
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:53,370
You think the group's still there?

1341
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:58,450
Oh my god, please get away from me.

1342
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:00,490
Which?

1343
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:15,750
Did you break your curse?

1344
01:36:16,450 --> 01:36:19,950
Who if I punch the portal upstairs?

1345
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:28,610
What if I just punch the portal upstairs?

1346
01:36:29,470 --> 01:36:30,570
What the fuck?

1347
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:38,480
All right, let's see.

1348
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:45,420
They used to be an Iron Fist main, and then Iron Fist got gutted, so...

1349
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:48,380
So now they play whatever they want.

1350
01:36:56,530 --> 01:36:58,230
This straight vegetable.

1351
01:37:01,330 --> 01:37:04,610
Oh my god, I ate bad pizza, and now eating pizza wants to play.

1352
01:37:08,410 --> 01:37:09,750
All right, let's avoid him.

1353
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:15,420
All right, let's look.

1354
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:40,280
all right you can't you sort of did okay i'm willing to risk it all right let's see oops i accidentally closed my my thing he sort of broke this curse it's sort of broken

1355
01:37:50,030 --> 01:38:01,510
uh i'm so sad what happened we're like a dying race now what happened The land used to be filled with venom twerkers.

1356
01:38:02,590 --> 01:38:04,830
Why did they all go extinct?

1357
01:38:05,210 --> 01:38:06,770
It's so sad.

1358
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:09,110
It's so...

1359
01:38:09,110 --> 01:38:09,510
Hello.

1360
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:10,630
Hello, lads.

1361
01:38:10,810 --> 01:38:12,050
You ready for some action?

1362
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:15,090
I hear someone's special day.

1363
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:20,210
He's like, no.

1364
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:21,850
No.

1365
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:24,450
He paid for double the entertainment.

1366
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:25,610
Bum bum.

1367
01:38:25,810 --> 01:38:26,230
Yeah.

1368
01:38:28,790 --> 01:38:29,390
See?

1369
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:34,890
Oh shit, Peter!

1370
01:38:35,190 --> 01:38:35,890
Let's go!

1371
01:38:36,490 --> 01:38:38,150
Let's go, Peter!

1372
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:40,650
Is that the turkey?

1373
01:38:40,810 --> 01:38:41,810
You know it!

1374
01:38:42,070 --> 01:38:42,810
Smack that!

1375
01:38:45,130 --> 01:38:47,950
Oh my god, wait, we gotta dance with the girls.

1376
01:38:48,150 --> 01:38:48,970
Give me a sec.

1377
01:38:49,610 --> 01:38:52,230
I didn't realize there was a girl party up there.

1378
01:38:52,630 --> 01:38:53,930
Don't worry, ladies.

1379
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:55,290
Did someone ask?

1380
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:56,730
Where?

1381
01:38:57,250 --> 01:38:59,090
For the special...

1382
01:38:59,090 --> 01:39:01,550
The special...

1383
01:39:01,550 --> 01:39:01,550
Entertainment?

1384
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:03,330
Right here.

1385
01:39:03,950 --> 01:39:04,790
That's... No!

1386
01:39:05,950 --> 01:39:07,650
They're like, stop.

1387
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:10,450
Ladies only.

1388
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:15,890
Hey, hey, technically I could be a lady too.

1389
01:39:16,830 --> 01:39:17,910
You think about it.

1390
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:19,730
Venom has...

1391
01:39:19,730 --> 01:39:22,970
Venom doesn't... We don't know what Venom's actual gender is.

1392
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:23,670
Guys.

1393
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:26,750
I could be a lady too.

1394
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:29,190
There is female Venom!

1395
01:39:31,410 --> 01:39:32,130
Yeah!

1396
01:39:33,790 --> 01:39:35,690
I could be female Venom!

1397
01:39:39,970 --> 01:39:41,190
I'm just...

1398
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:43,370
You're right, I'm just showing the superior cake.

1399
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:44,030
Exactly.

1400
01:39:45,070 --> 01:39:46,430
My cake is just better.

1401
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:49,210
Yeah, see?

1402
01:39:49,730 --> 01:39:50,450
Venom's...

1403
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:55,270
Venom symbiotic bio is technically with Mary Jane right now.

1404
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:58,350
So I'm positive the ladies.

1405
01:40:01,470 --> 01:40:02,970
Yeah, Venom is where the hook...

1406
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:05,350
It could be Mary Jane in that body right now.

1407
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:06,350
You don't know that.

1408
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:07,330
You don't know that.

1409
01:40:07,470 --> 01:40:08,910
He doesn't take off that mask.

1410
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:14,210
That could be... Mary Jane just could be like extra jacked up.

1411
01:40:14,270 --> 01:40:15,250
You don't know that.

1412
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:16,030
True.

1413
01:40:16,930 --> 01:40:20,590
He could be extra jacked up right now.

1414
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:23,510
You know, she went into bodybuilding class.

1415
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:31,360
No.

1416
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:33,980
She could have been into bodybuilding.

1417
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:35,360
Don't shame her.

1418
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,220
You don't know that.

1419
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,120
She could be doing bodybuilding.

1420
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:41,260
You don't know that.

1421
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:44,080
Why are you shaming Mary Jane?

1422
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:49,580
That's crazy that you would shame her.

1423
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:52,440
That's messed up.

1424
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,800
Mary Jane does not deserve that.

1425
01:41:04,970 --> 01:41:07,850
It's because Spider-Man doesn't know that it was actually Mary Jane.

1426
01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:09,690
Mary Jane's, like, pretending to be Eddie.

1427
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:12,590
You don't know.

1428
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:23,870
Alright.

1429
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:24,950
Torch time.

1430
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:29,540
Oh, man.

1431
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,420
I just realized I ran up water.

1432
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:33,760
Hmm.

1433
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:36,760
This is my last bottle of water.

1434
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:43,240
That's right.

1435
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:45,640
We've never heard Eddie talk at all.

1436
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:47,400
It could be Mary Jane.

1437
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:53,600
You'll need a talk I will be Jeff.

1438
01:41:57,740 --> 01:42:00,120
Yeah, but that's just that one skin.

1439
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:02,740
All the other skin is Mary Jane.

1440
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:05,120
It's just gender swap.

1441
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:08,040
The Phoenix skin?

1442
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:12,660
It's just that one skin that Eddie's in.

1443
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:14,420
Everything else is Mary Jane.

1444
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:21,400
I don't believe you.

1445
01:42:21,620 --> 01:42:22,520
That's on you.

1446
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:25,900
talk to chat today.

1447
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:38,200
It's okay, we got this.

1448
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:41,500
That is lore accurate.

1449
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:44,780
I know nothing about Marvel, but I think she's right.

1450
01:42:50,590 --> 01:42:54,070
Were you hungry when you came up with your name, Tenkow Chicken?

1451
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:57,250
Oh, I was gonna say eating pizza?

1452
01:42:57,490 --> 01:42:57,890
You mean?

1453
01:42:58,250 --> 01:43:00,390
Four, three, two, one.

1454
01:43:00,930 --> 01:43:02,010
Oh my god, girl?

1455
01:43:02,330 --> 01:43:03,190
No, that's Mary Jane.

1456
01:43:04,690 --> 01:43:08,430
Oh, that's fine.

1457
01:43:08,670 --> 01:43:09,090
Angela can deal with it.

1458
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:11,210
If Angela loses, that's on her.

1459
01:43:11,870 --> 01:43:14,110
But what the fuck?

1460
01:43:14,370 --> 01:43:16,330
Oh, I ain't dealing with that.

1461
01:43:21,510 --> 01:43:21,950
There you go.

1462
01:43:22,210 --> 01:43:24,190
We just slowly just pushed the card away.

1463
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:24,670
Oh, shit.

1464
01:43:24,770 --> 01:43:25,230
Look at that.

1465
01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:27,190
Yeah, that's a little stupid.

1466
01:43:28,150 --> 01:43:29,370
Yeah, fucking stupid.

1467
01:43:29,410 --> 01:43:30,290
Oh, shit.

1468
01:43:34,650 --> 01:43:36,410
What the fuck was over there?

1469
01:43:38,810 --> 01:43:40,690
Don't worry, I'm slowly...

1470
01:43:40,690 --> 01:43:41,190
Wait, is that?

1471
01:43:41,330 --> 01:43:42,090
Oh, no, it's town.

1472
01:43:42,690 --> 01:43:43,730
I was gonna say, am I...

1473
01:43:43,730 --> 01:43:44,070
Oh, wait.

1474
01:43:44,370 --> 01:43:45,830
They're playing triple support.

1475
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:47,490
We're playing triple support.

1476
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:48,750
Look at that.

1477
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:50,730
What a great game.

1478
01:43:53,830 --> 01:43:55,190
Look at that.

1479
01:43:55,290 --> 01:43:56,330
Oh, they can't portal.

1480
01:43:57,370 --> 01:43:58,810
What a great game.

1481
01:43:59,410 --> 01:44:00,110
I love this.

1482
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:01,410
I love Marvel Rivals.

1483
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:02,850
Look at that.

1484
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:06,210
This is a heal support society.

1485
01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:09,850
And we live in it.

1486
01:44:13,930 --> 01:44:15,210
Left click!

1487
01:44:16,130 --> 01:44:18,850
Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo!

1488
01:44:18,910 --> 01:44:19,170
Whoa!

1489
01:44:19,610 --> 01:44:19,990
I missed.

1490
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:25,030
I can't miss that!

1491
01:44:25,610 --> 01:44:26,110
Oh shit!

1492
01:44:27,090 --> 01:44:27,770
Oh shit!

1493
01:44:28,270 --> 01:44:29,850
Is this Charler back here?

1494
01:44:30,570 --> 01:44:31,210
Oopsie.

1495
01:44:31,970 --> 01:44:34,290
I was maybe being a little too silly.

1496
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:36,930

Oops.

1500

Yay!

1502
01:45:21,370 --> 01:45:22,090

01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:27,130
Okay, I hope that they don't lose this because I'm literally...

1505
01:45:27,130 --> 01:45:29,190
I literally sent them all behind us.

1506
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:32,570
I was like, they're all...

1507
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:33,450
My kill!

1508
01:45:33,850 --> 01:45:35,510
That's right, after that.

1511
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:11,550
Did we... Oh, they double all of this.

1512
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:13,670
That's a little sad.

1513
01:46:14,650 --> 01:46:15,150
Oh.

1514
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:17,630
That's a little sad.

1515
01:46:18,570 --> 01:46:20,510
Look, I tried my best.

1516
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:25,130
Like, literally, what else can I do?

1517
01:46:25,290 --> 01:46:25,990
I spit on you.

1518
01:46:26,310 --> 01:46:27,650
That's, like, my only ability.

1519
01:46:28,690 --> 01:46:29,930
What can I do?

1520
01:46:32,770 --> 01:46:33,650
Look at that.

1521
01:46:37,150 --> 01:46:38,270
Yeah, the... No, no.

1522
01:46:38,410 --> 01:46:40,150
We were playing Objective.

1523
01:46:40,670 --> 01:46:42,810
I was being a team player.

1524
01:46:43,610 --> 01:46:44,430
Look at me, girl.

1525
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:48,070
The most team player you can see.

1526
01:46:49,510 --> 01:46:50,010
Look at that.

1527
01:46:51,110 --> 01:46:53,110
Alright, I hope our Luna has up.

1528
01:46:54,170 --> 01:46:55,010
Oh, she...

1529
01:46:55,010 --> 01:46:55,750
Wait, she does.

1530
01:46:55,850 --> 01:46:58,450
If she dies, you have all!

1531
01:46:58,990 --> 01:46:59,590
What?

1532
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:04,010
Oh my god, that's unlucky.

1533
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:13,640
I timed it wrong.

1534
01:47:14,380 --> 01:47:15,280
I timed it wrong.

1535
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:18,300
Okay, I have to go sue.

1536
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,280
And they're playing.

1537
01:47:21,220 --> 01:47:22,180
I thought...

1538
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:24,440
No, I thought the punishable was over.

1539
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:26,340
I was going to be like, yoink.

1540
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:27,400
I timed it wrong.

1541
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:30,440
Math is...

01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:32,040
Guys, do you guys know I almost failed math?

1543
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:37,600
I counted in my head, but it was not the right type of counting.

1544
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:41,100
That's crazy, right?

Violet, uh, Violet, thank you for the raid.

1553
01:49:21,030 --> 01:49:21,870
I got a great stream.

1554
01:49:23,110 --> 01:49:25,290
He called me an ape.

1555
01:49:25,530 --> 01:49:26,730
What is this?

1556
01:49:27,090 --> 01:49:28,890
Okay, chill out, Colson.

1557
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:32,290
He's just awful at the game, and we don't have to go that far.

1558
01:49:32,730 --> 01:49:33,950
Okay, never mind.

1559
01:49:34,150 --> 01:49:35,570
He called me an ape.

1560
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:37,090
What is this?

1561
01:49:37,170 --> 01:49:38,450
Look, he's sick, okay.

1562
01:49:39,370 --> 01:49:39,890
Okay.

1563
01:49:44,710 --> 01:49:46,670
The battle starts in five.

1564
01:49:47,610 --> 01:49:50,470
Four, three, two, two, one.

1565
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:56,600
Nancy.

1566
01:49:57,740 --> 01:49:59,040
I was like, bro, chill out.

1567
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:00,380
Stop being so toxic.

1568
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:01,280
Never mind.

1569
01:50:01,460 --> 01:50:02,400
He called me an eight.

1570
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:06,000
That's crazy.

1571
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:10,680
That's fucking funny, though.

1572
01:50:18,910 --> 01:50:19,470
Never mind.

1573
01:50:19,570 --> 01:50:20,690
You can cook his ass.

1574
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:27,930
Jesus, I have to back up fully.

1575
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:32,810
Holy fuck, calm down, everybody.

1576
01:50:33,390 --> 01:50:33,970
Calm down.

1577
01:50:34,130 --> 01:50:35,710
That is so much damage.

1578
01:50:40,490 --> 01:50:42,270
Oh, where am I?

1579
01:50:42,630 --> 01:50:43,790
It's so empty.

1580
01:50:47,030 --> 01:50:47,790
There you go.

1581
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:49,910
Okay, that's on you.

1582
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:52,330
I don't know what the fuck why you were standing there.

1583
01:50:53,230 --> 01:50:54,350
I don't know why.

1584
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:58,410
I don't know why Luna stood there.

1585
01:50:59,050 --> 01:50:59,670
That's on you.

1586
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:00,870
We're just chilling.

1587
01:51:02,850 --> 01:51:09,890
Look, I might have been silly, but I wasn't not, I was, I was never mispositioned silly, okay?

1588
01:51:11,650 --> 01:51:15,690
I was everything else but mispositioned.

1589
01:51:18,430 --> 01:51:21,070
And that Luna is crazy for standing that.

1590
01:51:22,170 --> 01:51:27,590
Look, I die before- I don't die, I just use the alt rod.

1591
01:51:29,290 --> 01:51:29,970
There you go.

1592
01:51:29,970 --> 01:51:30,210
See?

1593
01:51:30,910 --> 01:51:31,530
How?

1594
01:51:32,210 --> 01:51:32,970
Wait, what?

1595
01:51:35,330 --> 01:51:35,910
Okay.

1596
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:40,670
Don't worry, we're fine.

1597
01:51:42,350 --> 01:51:44,330
I said I'm fine.

1598
01:51:44,550 --> 01:51:44,550
Sorry.

1599
01:51:44,910 --> 01:51:46,250
Let me be- I'm fine.

1600
01:51:48,850 --> 01:51:50,050
See, we are fine.

1601
01:51:50,390 --> 01:51:51,010
Just not her.

1602
01:51:52,990 --> 01:51:55,990
I don't know where the mag was trying to fucking shoot, though.

1603
01:51:56,150 --> 01:51:57,790
I was curious about that.

1604
01:51:59,490 --> 01:52:00,750
I'm gonna push him away.

1605
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:03,450
Jesus, we gotta touch.

1606
01:52:04,170 --> 01:52:04,710
Can we touch?

1607
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:06,850
Oh, that's unlucky.

1608
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:08,570
That's unlucky.

1609
01:52:08,730 --> 01:52:09,970
I hope our Luna lives.

1610
01:52:12,050 --> 01:52:12,770
Nope, 92.

1611
01:52:18,710 --> 01:52:19,150

See, guys, I'm doing my job.

1616
01:52:28,490 --> 01:52:29,410
I could go at him.

1617
01:52:31,410 --> 01:52:33,370
How much do I want to make this harder for my team?

1618
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:34,310
That's the question.

1619
01:52:39,110 --> 01:52:39,510
Alright.

1620
01:52:43,650 --> 01:52:44,870

1636
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:02,260
They can't get us.

1637
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:03,620
We're in our safety bubble.

1638
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:05,280
We're so safe.

1639
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:09,500
We're no longer safe the moment the bubble is gone.

1640
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:12,340
Please.

1641
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:15,020
Please let me still be in my safety bubble.

1642
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:16,240
There we go.

1643
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:20,300
Jesus Christ.

1644
01:54:20,580 --> 01:54:20,800
Okay.

01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:22,840

01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:24,260
You belong to me soon.

1647
01:54:24,380 --> 01:54:25,900
She has her mind control shit.

1648
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:27,300
Okay.

1649
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:28,300

Yay!

1652
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:33,660
What the fuck?

1653
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:38,060
Like, is he playing Attack on Titan?

1654
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:41,860
He does Attack on Titan name.

1655
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:46,540
I was like, where did he come from?

1656
01:54:48,020 --> 01:54:50,940
Luna, you are, you're giving me like, stress.

1657
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,700
And I don't deserve that.

1658
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:57,300
I already have enough of that and everything else.

1659
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:57,840
I do.

1660
01:54:59,860 --> 01:54:59,980
Oh.

1661
01:55:00,980 --> 01:55:03,320
Let's hope she doesn't get my own control.

1662
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:04,420
There we go.

1663
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:07,160
Look at that.

1664
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:08,060
I protected her.

1665
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:08,840
I'm a hero.

1666
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:12,620
There we go.

1667
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:14,220
Oh my god, Angela.

1668
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:16,500
I actually need that all charge though.

1669
01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:19,940
Look at this.

1670
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:21,220
What an easy game.

1671
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:23,660
Bravo is so cruel.

1672
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:25,820
It gives me an easy game than a hard game.

1673
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:27,300
And an easy game and a hard game.

1674
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:27,600
game.

1675
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:30,720
I'm not allowed to chill.

1676
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:38,220
Why can't I have, why can't the, why can't the streamer privilege where everybody just keeps throwing non-stop every, every game?

1677
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:41,580
But like on their team, not on my team, though.

1678
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:44,780
There you go.

1679
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:48,080
Yes, we can.

1680
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:54,640
All right, one again.

Okay, I thought he was aiming for me and the Luna.

Okay, I don't have anything for that.

Too much, too much.

We were too silly.

1717
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:13,860

01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:17,820
Too much.

1721
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:19,300
We could have saved the Angelo.

1722
01:58:25,060 --> 01:58:28,080
Okay, I'm just gonna use this and save her.

1723
01:58:28,540 --> 01:58:28,840
Nice.

1724
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:31,260
Dial it back a little.

1725
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:37,900
and chill, chill a little bit.

1726
01:58:41,770 --> 01:58:44,770
I hate Celestial players.

1727
01:58:46,510 --> 01:58:48,690
Chill, I'm actually platinum.

1728
01:58:52,390 --> 01:58:54,530
Bro, I wish I was in a Celestial lobby.

1729
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:56,850
Those lobbies seem fun.

1730
01:58:58,410 --> 01:58:58,870
Yay!

1731
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:04,100
Alright.

1732
01:59:04,620 --> 01:59:06,700
I don't even know who they were shit talking.

1733
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:08,040
Who was the thing?

1734
01:59:09,660 --> 01:59:10,840
Oh, this guy.

1735
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:12,240
I mean, he wasn't that bad.

1736
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:14,000
Maybe he was just on drugs.

1737
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:18,340
I don't think he was that bad.

1738
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:26,220
The fact that I'm surprised I had the most heals, honestly.

1739
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:27,860
I was playing Jeff.

1740
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:34,420
I was playing Jeff in the first half.

1741
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:36,080
So I'm surprised.

1742
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:44,230
I was...

1743
01:59:44,410 --> 01:59:46,210
I don't really look at it.

1744
01:59:49,010 --> 01:59:49,430
Alright.

1745
01:59:49,990 --> 01:59:52,030
I gotta go pee up your back.

1746
01:59:53,310 --> 01:59:53,870
Wait, don't worry.

1747
01:59:54,090 --> 01:59:55,310
I'll give you a dinner and a show.

1748
01:59:57,930 --> 01:59:58,370
I'll be back.

1749
02:01:45,130 --> 02:01:46,690
Came back just in time.

1750
02:01:47,890 --> 02:01:49,790
Oh, I don't have water, but I have lemonade.

1751
02:01:50,150 --> 02:01:51,010
So I'll just...

1752
02:01:51,010 --> 02:01:52,530
I'll just drink lemonade.

1753
02:01:55,070 --> 02:01:57,290
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

1754
02:01:59,850 --> 02:02:01,670
The cake is the dinner.

1755
02:02:02,210 --> 02:02:03,650
You get dinner and dessert.

1756
02:02:04,810 --> 02:02:07,770
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

1757
02:02:08,170 --> 02:02:08,910
Isn't that great?

1758
02:02:09,850 --> 02:02:11,150
You got a double special.

1759
02:02:11,350 --> 02:02:13,930
Who am I going to be in this economy too?

1760
02:02:14,410 --> 02:02:15,410
A cake and dinner.

1761
02:02:15,830 --> 02:02:18,150
You get cake for dessert and dinner.

1762
02:02:18,310 --> 02:02:19,110
Oh my god.

1763
02:02:19,230 --> 02:02:20,550
You should be like honored.

1764
02:02:20,970 --> 02:02:21,790
It's cost safe.

1765
02:02:21,930 --> 02:02:22,530
Exactly.

1766
02:02:22,870 --> 02:02:24,150
We're saving money.

1767
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:25,810
Exactly.

1768
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:28,070
I

1769
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:33,340
don't know.

1770
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:35,520
Why are we banning all of the time?

1771
02:02:45,220 --> 02:02:45,820
I'm not Emma.

1772
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:46,720
I'm banning Emma.

1773
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:48,400
Oh, I fucking feel it, Emma.

1774
02:02:50,420 --> 02:02:52,320
I don't want that mind control on me.

1775
02:02:52,860 --> 02:02:54,400
That Snow Bunny mind control.

1776
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:56,560
Get that away.

1777
02:02:56,680 --> 02:02:57,720
Be gone, witch!

1778
02:02:58,480 --> 02:02:59,260
Be gone!

1779
02:03:00,380 --> 02:03:02,160
My mind is strong as steel.

1780
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:04,280
You ain't mind controlling me.

1781
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:08,680
Shut up.

1782
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:13,760
I'd let her wake!

1783
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:15,080
You're weak.

1784
02:03:15,660 --> 02:03:16,760
Burn the witch.

1785
02:03:20,040 --> 02:03:21,040
You're weak.

1786
02:03:22,660 --> 02:03:23,860
Weak willed.

1787
02:03:31,370 --> 02:03:33,710
Do you know even know what that means?

1788
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:49,610
Cosmic rays didn't let me who I am today.

1789
02:03:50,330 --> 02:03:51,310
My family did.

1790
02:03:54,190 --> 02:03:54,990
Let's go.

1791
02:03:56,090 --> 02:03:56,830
I'm good playing.

1792
02:03:56,950 --> 02:04:00,190
I think like this season has been the least I played Luna ever.

1793
02:04:00,190 --> 02:04:00,470
I don't know.

1794
02:04:00,850 --> 02:04:05,290
I just want more variety now in my life.

1795
02:04:06,750 --> 02:04:07,530
I'm sorry, Luna.

1796
02:04:07,930 --> 02:04:08,570
I'm just...

1797
02:04:08,570 --> 02:04:09,050
I don't know.

1798
02:04:09,550 --> 02:04:10,750
She's just...

1799
02:04:10,750 --> 02:04:12,690
It's so boring.

1800
02:04:13,410 --> 02:04:14,270
It's just so boring.

1801
02:04:15,890 --> 02:04:17,210
They changed the ceiling?

1802
02:04:17,390 --> 02:04:18,930
The ceiling or the other ceiling?

1803
02:04:20,010 --> 02:04:23,070
Yeah, ever since I found out she's immune and I felt so betrayed.

1804
02:04:26,150 --> 02:04:27,350
No exception.

1805
02:04:27,550 --> 02:04:28,130
Wait, hey guys.

1806
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:29,650
Hey guys.

1807
02:04:31,030 --> 02:04:32,110
Hey guy!

1808
02:04:32,290 --> 02:04:33,130
Oh, it's all right.

1809
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:34,810
We don't need him, I guess.

1810
02:04:35,850 --> 02:04:37,910
What is that portal?

1811
02:04:38,990 --> 02:04:40,990
I am scared.

1812
02:04:42,710 --> 02:04:44,830
I have to go on the other side.

1813
02:04:45,050 --> 02:04:46,030
I was so confused.

1814
02:04:46,650 --> 02:04:48,950
I was actually so confused.

1815
02:04:49,710 --> 02:04:50,010
Okay.

1816
02:04:51,750 --> 02:04:53,850
I did not know where to look at.

1817
02:04:55,430 --> 02:04:59,530
Okay, I don't have another push, so that could not...

1818
02:05:00,850 --> 02:05:02,370
I push him away!

1819
02:05:04,370 --> 02:05:06,490
There's the supports over that side.

1820
02:05:06,790 --> 02:05:09,090
Like, maybe we could kill the supports on the right.

1821
02:05:09,730 --> 02:05:11,690
That's a silly concept, right?

1822
02:05:15,450 --> 02:05:16,530
Do we...

1823
02:05:16,530 --> 02:05:21,030
Hey guys, how about we kill the supports on the right side that are by themselves?

1824
02:05:22,690 --> 02:05:24,070
Yeah, I'm done with you.

1825
02:05:24,790 --> 02:05:26,010
I'm done with you, Luna.

1826
02:05:26,330 --> 02:05:27,570
I'm done playing with you.

1827
02:05:29,590 --> 02:05:58,490
I mean after like what four seasons of Luna I just feel like Because I felt like this season There is Okay I was so burnt out of Luna Because like What the fuck Oh shit Because this season was literally just It was Luna Loki all the time It was just Luna Loki Luna Loki And I was so tired I was so tired of that So like But this season,

1828
02:05:59,110 --> 02:06:01,410
every support, like, is viable now.

1829
02:06:04,470 --> 02:06:08,230
Like, last season, it was literally Luna Loki, Luna Loki, Luna Loki.

1830
02:06:08,990 --> 02:06:10,870
But this season, you can play any support.

1831
02:06:11,050 --> 02:06:14,090
You can play Jeff, you can play Invis, you can play Cloak.

1832
02:06:16,210 --> 02:06:18,110
Like, it's not Luna Loki anymore.

1833
02:06:18,370 --> 02:06:21,050
So I'm just, like, I'm just taking advantage of that.

1834
02:06:21,430 --> 02:06:23,010
That can actually play other things.

1835
02:06:23,090 --> 02:06:26,370
I'm like, oh my god, I can play other characters now.

1836
02:06:27,930 --> 02:06:36,750
like I'm not locked in please tell me oh thank God it's gonna it's like this guy

I demand her firstborn For what I did.

1846
02:08:16,340 --> 02:08:18,680
It feels good to step outside my bubble every now and then.

1847
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:22,010
That was gaming that I actually saved her life

1848
02:08:29,150 --> 02:08:36,620
I think her firstborn and be in her will when she dies Is with how she was playing?

1849

Yeah, that's what she gonna do with him That's not important the important is I get it Not if when I get it.

1850
02:08:52,280 --> 02:08:52,780
Yeah

1851
02:08:56,660 --> 02:09:04,320
All right See this is why I'm top five and I was top I'm watching out.

1852
02:09:04,420 --> 02:09:09,980
This is why I'm watching out this is why I'm I was top 500 when the game had a bigger player base.

1853
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:20,270
This is a waste of my jump, but like, I don't really care.

1854
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:25,250
I like how we could have helped, but nah, fuck that, I guess.

1855
02:09:26,110 --> 02:09:27,510
Okay, I healed, I healed, I healed.

1856
02:09:27,670 --> 02:09:28,390
You can't blame me.

1857
02:09:28,670 --> 02:09:29,050
I healed.

1858
02:09:30,190 --> 02:09:30,910
Please, okay.

1859
02:09:33,590 --> 02:09:35,030
Oh my god, I'm scared.

1860
02:09:35,350 --> 02:09:36,830
I don't like it here.

1861
02:09:38,590 --> 02:09:39,830
I'm sensing.

1862
02:09:40,570 --> 02:09:42,590
I know that...

1863
02:09:45,270 --> 02:09:51,550
Alright, there is a venom on the Luna and me and like, please.

1864
02:09:53,410 --> 02:09:54,290
We can't cap.

1865
02:09:54,670 --> 02:09:55,650
Oh, I missed the pull.

1866
02:09:56,170 --> 02:09:57,050
He was so fast.

1867
02:09:58,310 --> 02:09:59,090
He was zooming.

1868
02:10:00,490 --> 02:10:01,410
He was zooming.

1869
02:10:04,250 --> 02:10:05,550
That man zoomed.

1870
02:10:06,670 --> 02:10:07,570
Your Honor.

1871
02:10:12,530 --> 02:10:13,090
Where?

1872
02:10:13,770 --> 02:10:14,190

1873
02:10:16,650 --> 02:10:17,070
Oh.

02:10:18,110 --> 02:10:18,950
That's fine.

1875
02:10:19,890 --> 02:10:21,050
That's not as fine.

1876
02:10:22,150 --> 02:10:23,530
That's not as fine.

1877
02:10:24,090 --> 02:10:26,190
He was a little bit too...

1878
02:10:28,230 --> 02:10:29,430
Oh my god, that's good.

1879
02:10:29,610 --> 02:10:30,110
That's huge.

1880
02:10:30,610 --> 02:10:31,390
That's too much.

1881
02:10:33,690 --> 02:10:35,030
That's a little too much.

1882
02:10:35,190 --> 02:10:35,750
But that's okay.

1883
02:10:36,930 --> 02:10:37,290
Nice.

1884
02:10:37,450 --> 02:10:38,150

All right, I forgot about her.

Okay, I met up nice.

1892
02:11:57,450 --> 02:11:58,650
I know he wants to do it.

1893
02:11:59,210 --> 02:12:00,290
I knew it.

1894
02:12:00,490 --> 02:12:01,090
I knew it.

1895
02:12:01,250 --> 02:12:02,650
Please, I saved your life.

1896
02:12:05,430 --> 02:12:06,030
All right.

1897
02:12:06,030 --> 02:12:06,530
I leave.

1898
02:12:07,730 --> 02:12:08,050
I leave.

1899
02:12:10,090 --> 02:12:10,370
I leave.

1900
02:12:12,270 --> 02:12:15,690
I don't know what's going on inside there, but I believe in my team.

1901
02:12:16,950 --> 02:12:19,190
Don't worry, just play behind my shield!

1902
02:12:21,750 --> 02:12:22,030
See?

1903
02:12:22,750 --> 02:12:22,970
Easy.

1904
02:12:24,010 --> 02:12:24,750
Look at that.

1905
02:12:26,730 --> 02:12:27,670
No, it's eternal.

1906
02:12:27,870 --> 02:12:30,030
Summer vacation will never end!

1907
02:12:31,570 --> 02:12:32,010
No!

1908
02:12:32,370 --> 02:12:33,550
Don't say that!

1909
02:12:33,710 --> 02:12:35,010
It's summer forever!

1910
02:12:36,030 --> 02:12:37,690
I don't want to go back.

1911
02:12:38,970 --> 02:12:40,590
It'll never end.

1912
02:12:44,330 --> 02:12:44,610
Yay!

1913
02:12:47,330 --> 02:12:53,630
Now that I've won two games in a row, as per EOMM law, I shall lose 10 now.

1914
02:12:58,820 --> 02:13:00,380
Yeah, it's still hot outside.

1915
02:13:00,620 --> 02:13:01,280
There's nothing...

1916
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:04,240
It's not like it's global warming or anything, but it's still hot.

1917
02:13:04,660 --> 02:13:06,800
So it means summer vacation forever.

1918
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,640
Thank you for the 100 bitties.

1919
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:12,000
Thank you, thank you.

1920
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:14,680
I'm working on the Pantheon and Hotly Night right now.

1921
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:16,160
Got three or five endings.

1922
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:16,860
Oh, shit.

1923
02:13:17,120 --> 02:13:17,600
Good luck.

1924
02:13:17,780 --> 02:13:19,240
Good luck with the rest of the Pantheon.

1925
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:21,760
Oh, Amalee, thank you for the raid.

1926
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:24,200
I heard you were playing Rivals as well.

1927
02:13:25,700 --> 02:13:26,820
Thank you for the raid.

1928
02:13:26,980 --> 02:13:28,440
I hope you had a great stream.

1929
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:30,280
From Rivals to more Rivals.

1930
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:32,040
I hope you were able to rank up.

1931
02:13:32,180 --> 02:13:34,620
I'm just been messing about.

1932
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:35,460
They rank.

1933
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:38,520
Amalee's learning the recorder.

1934
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:39,940
She's learning to record her.

1935
02:13:42,680 --> 02:13:42,940
Next, see.

1936
02:13:42,980 --> 02:13:44,880
Thank you for the five gift that sells.

1938
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:46,320

02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:52,100
Yeah, I'm just, I'm also making you, dragging you back into a rival's basement.

1940
02:13:52,540 --> 02:13:53,020
That's right.

1941
02:13:53,120 --> 02:13:54,920
You get more rivals.

1942
02:13:58,160 --> 02:14:00,920
For those who don't know me, my name is Doki Bird.

1943
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:07,480
I usually stream on YouTube, but today I am on Twitch because I had a craving for a rank today.

1944
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:24,800
And I was like, And I had like a team that yelled at me last game off because I was playing rank off stream And I was like, you know what if I'm gonna get yelled at on if I'm gonna get yelled at and rank I might as well monetize it and So then I was like fuck it.

1945
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:36,700
We're streaming and then coincidentally I started streaming and all these Pussies stopped yelling at me because they don't want to get exposed It was just like well dokey bit.

1946
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:37,520

1947
02:14:37,900 --> 02:14:38,820

02:15:34,860 --> 02:15:36,800
I actually don't remember.

1953
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:38,040
I'm gonna play.

1954
02:15:38,260 --> 02:15:39,040
Is this Brawlcom?

1955
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:42,760
Technically it's Brawlcom so I can maybe get away with Jeff.

1956
02:15:44,060 --> 02:15:44,640
I don't know.

1957
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:45,680
Or maybe...

1958
02:15:47,580 --> 02:15:49,900
The thing is, we're on Groot.

1959
02:15:50,820 --> 02:15:51,960
Groot is so hard to heal.

1960
02:15:53,860 --> 02:15:54,420
Uh...

1961
02:15:55,460 --> 02:15:56,440
Let's see.

1962
02:15:57,020 --> 02:15:57,580
Yeah.

1963
02:15:59,580 --> 02:16:00,300
I don't know.

1964
02:16:00,620 --> 02:16:03,780
I just know I have, I think I only have two top 500 badges.

1965
02:16:04,660 --> 02:16:07,860
I might try for top 500 this season because it's a dragon.

1966
02:16:08,340 --> 02:16:10,440
That badge is a dragon and it's really cute.

1967
02:16:10,680 --> 02:16:11,400
I like it.

1968
02:16:13,820 --> 02:16:14,720
I mean, I could try.

1969
02:16:15,680 --> 02:16:17,100
I'm really bad as a result.

1970
02:16:18,160 --> 02:16:19,080
No, maybe I shouldn't.

1971
02:16:19,480 --> 02:16:22,240
Now, now when I just got raided, I'll play Invis.

1972
02:16:23,460 --> 02:16:24,580
Invis does more heals.

1973
02:16:25,940 --> 02:16:28,020
Oh my god, all the team up is just like, what are we doing?

1977
02:17:06,060 --> 02:17:07,180
Okay, he's dead.

1978
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:08,940
He is absolutely dead.

1979
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:10,020
Don't worry.

1980
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:12,710

Come on, he's won.

1984
02:17:20,840 --> 02:17:21,900
It's a little scary.

1985
02:17:22,100 --> 02:17:22,720
It's full dive.

1986
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:23,980
They're running full dive.

1987
02:17:24,220 --> 02:17:24,900
It's a little scary.

02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:26,780

I'm pretty sure.

2029
02:22:15,190 --> 02:22:16,410
Move out of the way.

Nice.

02:22:22,370 --> 02:22:23,450
Oh, we're back on Groot.

2032
02:22:23,690 --> 02:22:23,950
Why?

2033
02:22:24,710 --> 02:22:26,590
Oh, I guess there's no...

2034
02:22:26,850 --> 02:22:28,570
No, environmental, I think?

2035
02:22:28,750 --> 02:22:28,930
Yeah.

2036
02:22:29,690 --> 02:22:30,990
You can't do environmental here.

2037
02:22:31,990 --> 02:22:32,950
Makes sense.

2038
02:22:33,730 --> 02:22:35,970
Yay, Bob the Builder.

2039
02:22:37,810 --> 02:22:38,850
I was gonna say, why did he...

2040
02:22:40,010 --> 02:22:41,470
Let me break this with my...

2041
02:22:41,470 --> 02:22:41,990
Look at that.

2042
02:22:42,050 --> 02:22:43,290
I can't even break this.

2043
02:22:43,310 --> 02:22:45,190
That's how little my DPS is.

2044
02:22:46,530 --> 02:22:47,730
That's so sad.

2045
02:22:51,290 --> 02:22:52,230
Oh my god.

2046
02:22:52,430 --> 02:22:53,290
Wait, that's...

2047
02:22:53,290 --> 02:22:53,690
Nice.

2048
02:22:53,790 --> 02:22:54,210
Nice hit.

2049
02:22:54,690 --> 02:22:55,550
I'm scared.

2050
02:22:57,150 --> 02:22:59,350
Oh man, we're alive.

2051
02:23:00,190 --> 02:23:01,170
We're alive.

2052
02:23:01,690 --> 02:23:02,770
That's right, get back to your spot, man.

2053
02:23:02,870 --> 02:23:03,590
You think we're done with you?

2054
02:23:03,990 --> 02:23:04,670
Get over here.

2055
02:23:04,970 --> 02:23:05,770
Get over here.

2056
02:23:07,290 --> 02:23:08,710
Oh, I got e-lifts.

2057
02:23:09,270 --> 02:23:10,470
He lives.

2058
02:23:11,490 --> 02:23:11,990
He lives.

2059
02:23:15,110 --> 02:23:17,370
I pulled him back, but I couldn't.

2060
02:23:17,770 --> 02:23:19,390
Yeah, he ran like a bitch.

2061
02:23:23,090 --> 02:23:23,950
That's right.

2062
02:23:25,150 --> 02:23:26,410
Oh, I hear the Angela.

2063
02:23:26,850 --> 02:23:28,470
I gotta get ready.

2064
02:23:28,850 --> 02:23:29,990
Oh, that's fine.

2065
02:23:30,790 --> 02:23:31,370
He's fine.

2066
02:23:32,490 --> 02:23:33,190
See, he's fine.

2067
02:23:33,730 --> 02:23:34,850
I want to save my...

2068
02:23:35,490 --> 02:23:37,070
I want to save...

2069
02:23:37,070 --> 02:23:37,530
There you go.

2070
02:23:37,670 --> 02:23:38,670
I had a feeling, yeah.

2071
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:40,610
Oh my god.

2072
02:23:41,010 --> 02:23:42,150
Oh my god!

2073
02:23:43,210 --> 02:23:45,690
What did the spider-man get?

2074
02:23:45,730 --> 02:23:47,010
I was trying to peel!

2075
02:23:47,450 --> 02:23:48,930
Where did he come from?

2076
02:23:49,270 --> 02:23:50,670
I mean, I'll take it.

2077
02:23:51,110 --> 02:23:52,010
Oh shit!

2078
02:23:53,850 --> 02:23:55,850
I was just trying to peel.

2079
02:23:57,890 --> 02:23:58,390
Push!

2080
02:23:59,190 --> 02:23:59,670
Oh my god.

2081
02:23:59,910 --> 02:24:00,310
Oh my god.

2082
02:24:00,430 --> 02:24:01,030
I can't push all that.

2083
02:24:01,250 --> 02:24:02,350
I can't push all of that.

2084
02:24:02,670 --> 02:24:03,810
Oh my god.

2085
02:24:05,470 --> 02:24:05,970
It's...

2086
02:24:08,950 --> 02:24:10,230
It's everything I put.

2087
02:24:12,050 --> 02:24:13,110
It hit everything.

2088
02:24:14,310 --> 02:24:15,670
There was nothing I...

2089
02:24:15,670 --> 02:24:17,330
That was actually nothing I could do.

2090
02:24:17,950 --> 02:24:19,450
That was pure hell.

2091
02:24:20,210 --> 02:24:22,670
That was just straight up...

2092
02:24:22,670 --> 02:24:24,190
Straight up cyber bullying.

2093
02:24:25,670 --> 02:24:26,830
Yeah, I lived a lot longer.

2094
02:24:26,850 --> 02:24:29,850

Yay!

2105
02:25:48,510 --> 02:25:50,230
Another epic victory!

2106
02:25:51,110 --> 02:25:51,810
Yay!

2107
02:25:54,090 --> 02:25:54,790
Yay!

2108
02:25:58,530 --> 02:26:00,110
Both of us in PN.

2109
02:26:00,170 --> 02:26:01,630

2110
02:26:01,890 --> 02:26:02,170
Yay!

2111
02:26:02,350 --> 02:26:04,630
It's a Jeff win.

2112
02:26:05,290 --> 02:26:06,470
Yeah, good Jeff game.

2113
02:26:06,770 --> 02:26:07,190

2114
02:26:07,310 --> 02:26:07,890
Thank you.

2115
02:26:07,950 --> 02:26:09,790
It was my best Jeff game.

2116
02:26:10,310 --> 02:26:13,050
See, the Ludo was there for you.

2117
02:26:14,190 --> 02:26:14,710
Yay.

2118
02:26:19,590 --> 02:26:20,790
I swear.

2119
02:26:21,210 --> 02:26:30,730
Our Ludo, I don't, our Ludo was on, was on DPS, was on damage boost for like 80% of that all.

2120
02:26:30,830 --> 02:26:31,590
That was crazy.

2121
02:26:32,350 --> 02:26:53,330

2123
02:27:08,790 --> 02:27:10,770
Why I get ad for adult diapers?

2124
02:27:11,010 --> 02:27:15,310
Because the ads are made for you.

2125
02:27:15,430 --> 02:27:16,930
You do know that, right?

2126
02:27:19,190 --> 02:27:20,930
The ads are personalized.

2127
02:27:22,370 --> 02:27:23,650
And why did you out yourself?

2128
02:27:24,650 --> 02:27:26,030
Oh my god, there's a fellow.

2129
02:27:26,210 --> 02:27:27,430
There's a fellow, Vedam.

2130
02:27:28,430 --> 02:27:30,450
It's charting self-reported.

2131
02:27:33,050 --> 02:27:33,890
You didn't know.

2132
02:27:33,910 --> 02:27:36,390
not need to self-report, bro.

2133
02:27:38,030 --> 02:27:39,010
Hello, everyone.

2134
02:27:40,110 --> 02:27:41,190
Where is my fellow?

2135
02:27:41,390 --> 02:27:41,750

2136
02:27:42,550 --> 02:27:43,290
Hey, there.

2137
02:27:43,950 --> 02:27:44,670

I heard.

2141
02:27:48,850 --> 02:27:51,570
I heard Sue has been out of town.

2142
02:27:52,350 --> 02:27:53,070
Mr. Fantastic.

2143
02:27:53,630 --> 02:27:53,950
Hey.

2144
02:27:54,250 --> 02:27:55,010
Come over here.

2145
02:27:55,130 --> 02:27:55,910
That's right.

2146
02:27:57,690 --> 02:27:58,350
Yeah.

2147
02:27:59,150 --> 02:28:00,990
You're getting lonely, aren't you?

2148
02:28:05,570 --> 02:28:28,170

2149
02:28:31,210 --> 02:28:33,850
Look, he's even, you know what the worst part is?

2150
02:28:34,190 --> 02:28:36,910
The worst part is that he's in his wedding outfit right now.

2151
02:28:37,070 --> 02:28:38,050
That's the worst part.

2152
02:28:41,330 --> 02:28:43,050
He's in his groom outfit.

2153
02:28:43,610 --> 02:28:44,430
That's on him.

2154
02:28:47,910 --> 02:28:50,090
You mean the best part?

2155
02:28:50,110 --> 02:28:51,910
What, Chiru, do you think you want to be today?

2156
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:56,200
You're right.

2157
02:28:57,100 --> 02:28:58,100
Hey, did anyone hire?

2158
02:28:58,260 --> 02:29:01,580
We didn't hire Venom for the bachelor party.

2159
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:02,820
Oh my god, everyone's.

2160
02:29:02,840 --> 02:29:29,140

02:29:31,060 --> 02:29:33,360
My heart desires you.

2163
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:37,720
I'm not gonna lie, Penny works with pretty much anything.

2164
02:29:37,720 --> 02:29:38,760
That's hot.

2165
02:29:39,080 --> 02:29:40,620
You can say you're the best, yeah?

2166
02:29:41,480 --> 02:29:42,400
No, no, no, no.

2167
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:44,300
I'm going to tell you the best in America.

2168
02:29:45,140 --> 02:29:46,060
North Africa.

2169
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:51,580
I bet you'd be the best player in, like, South Sudan.

2170
02:29:52,020 --> 02:29:56,060
Why do we not like the South Sudan come from?

2171
02:29:58,100 --> 02:30:30,580
a little bromance in rank doesn't hurt nobody oh just a little bromance in rank guys it's time by the way number two you don't have to play rock if you don't want i don't need the team up i don't care i'm so low support not glitched yeah the the little feature that the game has feature that's right obviously time i i can after the last game i'm relaxing guys I tried last game right now.

02:30:33,740 --> 02:30:35,360
I'm relaxing now.

2174
02:30:35,700 --> 02:30:43,000
I tried already I already try hard now it's chill time.

2175
02:30:45,400 --> 02:30:48,440
Love can bloom even in Marvel Rivals.

2176
02:30:48,440 --> 02:30:50,860
If you want to you can swap now otherwise you can save.

2177
02:30:51,400 --> 02:30:51,660
You want something.

2178
02:30:51,820 --> 02:30:53,660
We're solo sup rocket.

2179
02:30:55,500 --> 02:30:59,380
Rocket rocket is best solo support.

2180
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:05,180
It's true.

2181
02:31:06,020 --> 02:31:06,960
It's actually true.

2182
02:31:07,160 --> 02:31:09,100
When you run solo support, you have to play Raqqa.

2183
02:31:11,440 --> 02:31:13,780
It's unfortunately sad, but it's true.

2184
02:31:15,320 --> 02:31:16,540
I get my break time.

2185
02:31:17,980 --> 02:31:18,940
I'm not going to go for a pool.

2186
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:21,220
This is my little break time.

2187
02:31:21,820 --> 02:31:23,180
My relax time.

2188
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:29,180
Wait, I hear more than one.

2189
02:31:29,500 --> 02:31:29,760

2190
02:31:30,100 --> 02:31:30,900

Oh, shit.

2198
02:32:14,380 --> 02:32:14,660
Hello.

2199
02:32:14,840 --> 02:32:15,720
There is a rocket.

2200
02:32:16,400 --> 02:32:16,560
Oh.

2201
02:32:17,600 --> 02:32:18,640
Oh, that's unfortunate.

2202
02:32:19,020 --> 02:32:19,300
Does he?

2203
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:20,200
Yeah, okay.

2204
02:32:20,360 --> 02:32:20,900
Yes, there is.

2205
02:32:21,180 --> 02:32:22,020
That's the monkey guy.

2206
02:32:22,260 --> 02:32:23,520
That's the rocket guy that I play with.

2207
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:24,460
That's the rocket guy.

2208
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:25,820
There's a rocket guy.

2209
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:27,160
That's what he's doing instead of healing you.

2210
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:29,800
Don't die, man.

2211
02:32:31,000 --> 02:33:01,900
Luna I got you I got you I'm right-clicking that's all I could do oh my God that's all I could do rock please oh that's unfortunate that's unfortunate none of us took damage none of us took any damage I'm sorry it's crazy no one took any damage that entire round Wait.

2212
02:33:03,400 --> 02:33:03,800
Can we?

2213
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:04,480
Nope.

2214
02:33:05,220 --> 02:33:05,700
Nope.

2215
02:33:06,760 --> 02:33:07,240
Nope.

2216
02:33:07,500 --> 02:33:09,080
Why did no one stand in front of...

2217
02:33:09,080 --> 02:33:10,500
Oh my gosh, I stood in front of him.

2218
02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:15,340
I thought, like, I as the rocket would not be the body blocker, you know?

2219
02:33:16,300 --> 02:33:20,800
I thought out of everybody, I'd be the last person to be body blocking.

2220
02:33:21,220 --> 02:33:23,820
It is crazy that that became my job.

2221
02:33:24,880 --> 02:33:25,260
That should go.

2222
02:33:25,360 --> 02:33:26,340
You got Hulk in your belt?

2223
02:33:27,620 --> 02:33:28,600
Don't worry, I got you.

2224
02:33:29,500 --> 02:33:30,800
Don't worry, I got you.

2225
02:33:31,540 --> 02:33:32,720
I got you.

2226
02:33:33,420 --> 02:33:33,980
Let's go.

2227
02:33:34,520 --> 02:33:35,300
Let's go.

2228
02:33:35,820 --> 02:33:36,660
They're going to destroy it.

2229
02:33:36,680 --> 02:33:37,840
Oh, they're not shooting it.

2230
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:38,400
Thank God.

2231
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:39,280
Okay, they're stupid.

2232
02:33:39,660 --> 02:33:40,520
Let's go.

2233
02:33:41,300 --> 02:33:42,180
I stopped.

2234
02:33:42,660 --> 02:33:43,320
Oh, nice.

2235
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:44,300
Oh, you're seeing me.

2236
02:33:44,980 --> 02:33:46,600
I stopped it.

2237
02:33:48,900 --> 02:33:50,380
All right, nice.

2238
02:33:50,960 --> 02:33:52,680
Okay, I have to swap off.

2239
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:54,700
Oh, it's fighting coming in for an off.

2240
02:33:55,640 --> 02:33:56,120
He is?

2241
02:33:56,460 --> 02:33:56,780
Goodbye.

2242
02:33:58,180 --> 02:33:58,720
Goodbye.

2245
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:04,080

2312
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:01,560
Don't worry.

2313
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:03,580
Maybe somebody's close to this.

2314
02:37:05,080 --> 02:37:06,480
I'm just playing for my life.

2315
02:37:06,820 --> 02:37:07,600

2316
02:37:08,520 --> 02:37:09,760

2323
02:37:22,060 --> 02:37:22,180

Okay, watch this.

2327
02:37:29,880 --> 02:37:30,980
He's going to destroy it.

2328
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:32,260
He's gonna destroy it.

2329
02:37:32,260 --> 02:37:33,000
He's gonna...

2330
02:37:33,780 --> 02:37:36,580
Guys, he's destroying it.

2331
02:37:36,820 --> 02:37:37,160
Never mind.

2332
02:37:37,620 --> 02:37:38,720
No more watch this.

2333
02:37:38,900 --> 02:37:40,680
He's gonna destroy it.

2334
02:37:42,280 --> 02:37:43,200
Oh, no.

2335
02:37:44,340 --> 02:37:45,780
No more watch this.

2336
02:37:46,220 --> 02:37:46,520
Yes.

2337
02:37:47,300 --> 02:37:50,220
He may or may not have destroyed it.

2338
02:37:50,320 --> 02:37:50,580
Oh!

2339
02:37:51,780 --> 02:37:53,320
Hello, I am alive.

2340
02:37:55,700 --> 02:37:56,100
Alright.

2341
02:37:56,280 --> 02:37:58,900
I should have died so we could have our res again.

2342
02:37:59,060 --> 02:37:59,940
That is my bad.

2343
02:38:00,840 --> 02:38:00,980
Oh.

2344
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:02,800
Oh wait, we gotta kill!

2345
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:04,220
We gotta kill!

2346
02:38:05,260 --> 02:38:05,840
Wait, what?

2347
02:38:06,460 --> 02:38:07,260
Oh we're going in.

2348
02:38:07,800 --> 02:38:09,480
Oh shit, oh shit, give me a sec.

2349
02:38:10,280 --> 02:38:10,860
Give me a sec.

2350
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:12,520
Don't worry.

2351
02:38:18,320 --> 02:38:18,760
Nice.

2352
02:38:21,120 --> 02:38:21,300
Nice!

2353
02:38:22,420 --> 02:38:24,180
He doesn't know, he doesn't know I'm here.

2354
02:38:24,500 --> 02:38:26,480
He doesn't know, he doesn't know I'm here.

2355
02:38:26,960 --> 02:38:28,600
He doesn't know, I'm here.

2356
02:38:28,840 --> 02:38:29,800
He doesn't know!

2357
02:38:30,020 --> 02:38:30,920
He doesn't know!

2358
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:38,980

There you go.

2361
02:38:40,860 --> 02:38:46,950
He only lacks critical information How did they not see me?

02:40:09,820 --> 02:40:12,480
I think our Spider-Man might be better.

2365
02:40:14,120 --> 02:40:15,620
He's gonna grip me, isn't he?

2366
02:40:16,240 --> 02:40:18,060

Yeah, I knew it.

2368
02:40:21,940 --> 02:40:23,920
I was like, he wanted that grip.

2369
02:40:24,100 --> 02:40:25,180
Oh, they're running triple support.

2370
02:40:25,300 --> 02:40:25,800
They have Ultron.

2371
02:40:26,680 --> 02:40:28,300
I see Ultron.

2372
02:40:31,460 --> 02:40:32,500
Oh, no.

2374
02:40:38,180 --> 02:40:39,020
That's fine.

2375
02:40:41,300 --> 02:40:42,260
It's so...

2376
02:40:42,260 --> 02:40:43,520
It's not fine no more.

2377
02:40:44,020 --> 02:40:45,020
Oh, they have Penny.

2378
02:40:45,560 --> 02:40:46,100
Wait, where is he?

2379
02:40:46,320 --> 02:40:47,100
Oh, my God.

2380
02:40:47,180 --> 02:40:47,860
She's in the air.

2381
02:40:47,940 --> 02:40:48,420
I'm sorry.

2382
02:40:50,720 --> 02:40:52,020

2383
02:40:52,440 --> 02:40:53,640
I was like, where is he?

2384
02:40:54,500 --> 02:40:55,860

2385
02:40:56,300 --> 02:40:57,200
Oh, shit.

2386
02:41:00,200 --> 02:41:00,900
Oh, that's...

2387
02:41:00,920 --> 02:41:01,700
That's my bad.

2388
02:41:02,040 --> 02:41:02,920
I need to wait for...

2389
02:41:03,440 --> 02:41:04,460
Oh, they're running...

2390
02:41:04,460 --> 02:41:05,980
They're running Penny.

2391
02:41:07,280 --> 02:41:08,420
So it means I have to...

2392
02:41:08,420 --> 02:41:09,380
I have to play Sue.

2393
02:41:10,160 --> 02:41:10,940
Yeah, I'm playing Sue.

2394
02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:13,660
Because, like, I'm not playing...

2395
02:41:14,300 --> 02:41:17,080
I'm not playing Cloak against Penny.

2396
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:19,140
I know what happened.

2397
02:41:20,560 --> 02:41:21,520
God damn it.

2398
02:41:24,080 --> 02:41:26,220
I know exactly what's gonna happen.

2399
02:41:27,540 --> 02:41:28,220
There you go.

2400
02:41:32,720 --> 02:41:33,240
Okay.

2401
02:41:33,340 --> 02:41:36,660
All right, I gotta care about Luna more.

2402
02:41:40,320 --> 02:41:41,680
Come on, I messed...

2403
02:41:41,680 --> 02:41:43,140
Come on, he messed up his swing!

2404
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:45,780
We killed Bucky!

2405
02:41:47,940 --> 02:41:49,580
I'm a little scared about...

2406
02:41:51,500 --> 02:41:52,940
I mean, we could kite that.

2407
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:54,120
Except for our Angela.

2408
02:41:55,480 --> 02:41:57,480
Whoa, yeah, except for our...

2409
02:41:58,000 --> 02:41:59,560
Oh my god, okay.

02:41:59,980 --> 02:42:00,480
That's fine.

2411
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:06,920
Okay, that's fine.

2412
02:42:07,500 --> 02:42:08,040
What?

2413
02:42:08,720 --> 02:42:09,100
How?

2414
02:42:13,900 --> 02:42:14,940
Oh my god.

2415
02:42:15,360 --> 02:42:15,960
That's unlucky.

2416
02:42:16,320 --> 02:42:19,480
Our Luna got gripped away from my ult.

2417
02:42:19,960 --> 02:42:20,980
That's so unlucky.

2418
02:42:24,300 --> 02:42:26,560
No, our Luna was outside my ult.

2419
02:42:27,220 --> 02:42:29,040
Yeah, that's a... They ran triple support.

2420
02:42:29,280 --> 02:42:29,920
What could we do?

2421
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:31,940
Spider-Man is useless against triple.

2422
02:42:33,560 --> 02:42:34,860
Like, he can't do anything.

2423
02:42:35,080 --> 02:42:36,080
Because they just peel.

2424
02:42:36,560 --> 02:42:37,100
There's...

2425
02:42:37,100 --> 02:42:39,420
Like, you know, Spider-Man already has to deal with two peelers.

2426
02:42:39,560 --> 02:43:26,080
Now the spider-man is dealing with like three people that can that can I can care for each other so it's like yes, it's just unfortunate It's just unfortunate Please save our strange oh my god you're Luna you're fucking crazy Nice There you go all right oh my god please i'm gonna try i don't i can't build all the time oh my god please luna i'm trying so hard to care for you right now guys fight them

2427
02:43:32,420 --> 02:43:36,940
fight them please

2428
02:43:43,960 --> 02:43:45,580
oh my god I have a

2429
02:43:48,820 --> 02:43:56,420
I have to use it's just so we can live that's unlucky I don't think we're winning this guys

2430
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:09,540
oh my god I tried so hard to peel I felt like All I did was peel.

2431
02:44:12,220 --> 02:44:13,040
Nothing is that.

2432
02:44:13,300 --> 02:44:14,440
Because we're running...

2433
02:44:14,440 --> 02:44:16,100
DPS we're running is like...

2434
02:44:19,660 --> 02:44:23,860
Like the DPS we're running cannot kill triple support.

2435
02:44:25,260 --> 02:44:26,540
These are really good.

2436
02:44:31,960 --> 02:44:32,680
Yeah.

2437
02:44:34,980 --> 02:44:36,100
That's the thing.

2438
02:44:36,320 --> 02:44:38,880
They literally counted our spam, man, because they went triple.

2439
02:44:41,700 --> 02:44:45,180
I can't play Rocket because she was on Angela.

2440
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:46,120
There was no reason.

2441
02:44:50,650 --> 02:44:52,570
He's like, you guys are really good.

2442
02:44:55,430 --> 02:44:56,550
That's so unlucky.

2443
02:44:57,450 --> 02:44:59,490
We didn't play anything that counters triple support.

2444
02:45:01,430 --> 02:45:04,610
I don't remember what actually, to be fair, I don't even know what counters triple support.

2445
02:45:05,930 --> 02:45:40,030
I think you just have, it's like, I think you just play triple support the counter triple support that's like the only way i feel like like it's just whoever team plays the better triple support wins yeah no because the thing is like um people you you just do so much damage but there's never like there's no like follow up follow up there's no like actual uh like you do so much damage but they just heal each other.

2446
02:45:40,170 --> 02:45:40,970
Like, what can I do?

2447
02:45:41,670 --> 02:45:42,390
What can you do?

2448
02:45:42,870 --> 02:45:44,130
They just heal each other.

2449
02:45:45,390 --> 02:45:50,370
It's literally like, it's literally just whoever plays the better triple support, but no, none of our teammates wanted to play triple support.

2450
02:45:59,620 --> 02:46:06,960
I think it's like, you have to play four DPS, one support, and one tank to beat triple support.

2451
02:46:07,520 --> 02:46:11,960
Because you just put so much, you just put so much damage into it, they can't heal it.

2452
02:46:16,550 --> 02:46:19,470
There's so much, just like, fucking all that damage in.

2453
02:46:19,830 --> 02:46:20,510
Like, what can they do?

2454
02:46:21,170 --> 02:46:23,450
You can't out-heal death at that point.

2455
02:46:28,490 --> 02:46:28,830
Jeff Nato?

2456
02:46:29,190 --> 02:46:29,430
No.

2457
02:46:31,270 --> 02:46:32,370
Jeff Nato fucking sucks.

2458
02:46:32,990 --> 02:46:34,130
Because Storm sucks.

2459
02:46:34,450 --> 02:46:37,810
Storm is only viable against Triple Tank.

2460
02:46:38,650 --> 02:46:40,470
Storm just sucks as a character.

2461
02:46:42,090 --> 02:46:42,990
Right now.

2462
02:46:43,110 --> 02:46:43,670
Right now.

2463
02:46:44,190 --> 02:46:46,290
She wasn't- She wasn't bad before.

2464
02:46:48,030 --> 02:46:50,250
Did I have the Moki guy again?

2465
02:46:58,250 --> 02:46:59,570
Maybe Namor Hawk?

2466
02:46:59,910 --> 02:47:00,370
Namor...

2467
02:47:00,370 --> 02:47:01,530
Bruce, maybe.

2468
02:47:01,970 --> 02:47:02,870
Hulk, maybe.

2469
02:47:03,930 --> 02:47:05,210
Namor Hulk is pretty good.

2470
02:47:05,430 --> 02:47:06,530
Not to play Luna.

2471
02:47:11,330 --> 02:47:13,290
I don't want to.

2472
02:47:15,290 --> 02:47:17,390
I don't want to play Luna.

2473
02:47:18,210 --> 02:47:19,190
I don't want to.

2474
02:47:19,350 --> 02:47:20,270
Get me out.

2475
02:47:25,150 --> 02:47:26,470
Back to Luna, jail.

2476
02:47:26,790 --> 02:47:27,390
I go.

2477
02:47:29,350 --> 02:47:29,890
Wham.

2478
02:47:30,170 --> 02:47:32,610
I get GM too.

2479
02:47:32,730 --> 02:47:33,490
I might just stop.

2480
02:47:36,410 --> 02:47:38,910
Before they take me too deep in.

2481
02:47:40,810 --> 02:47:41,990
They have a Jeff.

2482
02:47:43,550 --> 02:47:44,770
Who's stream sniping?

2483
02:47:46,170 --> 02:47:48,130
Yeah, you fucking stream sniper.

2484
02:47:52,050 --> 02:47:54,050
What do I have to give it to?

2485
02:47:54,350 --> 02:47:54,370
Whoa.

2486
02:47:58,120 --> 02:47:58,700
Alright.

2487
02:47:59,260 --> 02:47:59,680
Grab that.

2488
02:47:59,740 --> 02:48:01,520
I do want to end top 500 this season.

2489
02:48:01,540 --> 02:48:03,260
I want to do it.

2490
02:48:03,320 --> 02:48:03,760
Oh, nice.

2491
02:48:15,060 --> 02:48:16,320
That's fucking hilarious.

2492
02:48:16,620 --> 02:48:17,300
Okay, I'll body block.

2493
02:48:18,540 --> 02:48:19,540
There you go.

2494
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:20,320
I bought you out.

2495
02:48:20,440 --> 02:48:22,140
That's how you do it, bitch!

2496
02:48:24,240 --> 02:48:25,960
That's how you do it!

2497
02:48:27,460 --> 02:48:34,860
The fact that I had the body block for you, fuckers oh my god please

2498
02:48:39,060 --> 02:49:11,040
i couldn't get in he was still there he was still there i didn't think he was so close to me door stuck door stuck he was i did not I didn't think he was still there.

2499
02:49:11,120 --> 02:49:12,520
I was not expecting that.

2500
02:49:12,820 --> 02:49:13,860
I thought he was gone.

2501
02:49:15,100 --> 02:49:17,220
I was about to jump in too.

2502
02:49:17,300 --> 02:49:18,160
That was the worst part.

2503
02:49:18,580 --> 02:49:21,240
I was just about to jump in when he came back.

2504
02:49:21,940 --> 02:49:23,180
Fucking menace to society.

2505
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:24,400
JJ ate him.

2506
02:49:25,100 --> 02:49:26,060
He was right.

2507
02:49:28,320 --> 02:49:29,780
He is a criminal.

2508
02:49:31,540 --> 02:50:05,320

02:50:10,480 --> 02:50:11,400
Like, who's killing us?

2512
02:50:11,480 --> 02:50:12,220
Who is killing us?

2513
02:50:13,760 --> 02:50:15,360
We literally got eaten by Jeff.

2514
02:50:15,560 --> 02:50:16,920
What the fuck does he mean?

2515
02:50:17,400 --> 02:50:23,580
Who is killing- did he not see the giant ass fucking shark that ate us?

2516
02:50:26,840 --> 02:50:29,860

2519
02:51:00,980 --> 02:51:02,800
Let's do it for now.

2520
02:51:04,180 --> 02:51:04,220
Please.

2521
02:51:05,540 --> 02:51:06,380
See, this is what I'm saying.

2522
02:51:06,580 --> 02:51:08,220
The moment... Oh, my God.

2523
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:12,400
This is what I'm saying.

2524
02:51:12,620 --> 02:51:15,420
The moment you go triple support, he's actually used this.

2525
02:51:17,380 --> 02:51:18,860
Because, like, what can he do?

2526
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:20,020
What?

2527
02:51:21,320 --> 02:51:22,660
What can he do?

2528
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:24,560
We just...

2529
02:51:25,200 --> 02:51:27,200
We just heal each other.

2530
02:51:29,440 --> 02:51:30,860
I swear.

2531
02:51:31,280 --> 02:51:32,780
God, get out!

2532
02:51:43,290 --> 02:51:44,730
Who did he?

2533
02:51:45,390 --> 02:51:45,690
What?

2534
02:51:48,630 --> 02:51:50,570
Who did he eat?

2535
02:51:51,250 --> 02:51:52,970
I'm so confused.

2536
02:51:58,530 --> 02:52:00,650
Who was he?

2537
02:52:00,730 --> 02:52:00,970

2540
02:52:38,190 --> 02:52:39,150
Okay, you can go first.

2541
02:52:39,450 --> 02:52:40,030
Yeah, I'll go first.

2542
02:52:42,910 --> 02:52:43,270
It's okay.

2543
02:52:45,090 --> 02:52:46,470
Wait, can we let Rocky go first actually?

2544
02:52:46,610 --> 02:52:47,170
Can we let Rocky go first?

2545
02:52:48,750 --> 02:52:50,290
Oh, oh my god.

2546
02:52:51,710 --> 02:52:52,070
It's fine.

2547
02:52:52,950 --> 02:52:53,690
It's fine.

2548
02:52:53,890 --> 02:52:55,990
Look at that.

2549
02:52:57,290 --> 02:52:58,230
He's gonna change all!

2550
02:52:58,270 --> 02:52:59,630
He's gonna change all!

2551
02:53:02,970 --> 02:53:03,450
Yay!

2552
02:53:04,790 --> 02:53:06,150
I don't know how.

2553
02:53:07,790 --> 02:53:11,090
I saw death in my eyes.

2554
02:53:11,810 --> 02:53:12,850
I don't know.

2555
02:53:13,070 --> 02:53:13,330
It worked.

2556
02:53:13,610 --> 02:53:14,910
We're so healthy.

2557
02:53:15,450 --> 02:53:17,070
We're so healthy.

2558
02:53:18,530 --> 02:53:20,430
That was the healthiest I've ever been.

2559
02:53:20,470 --> 02:53:23,410
I was one foot on my deathbed.

2560
02:53:23,570 --> 02:53:28,450
They were right about to bury me alive before I made a miraculous recovery.

2561
02:53:30,850 --> 02:53:33,330
That was very scary.

2562
02:53:34,270 --> 02:53:36,270
You think?

2563
02:53:39,530 --> 02:53:39,890
Wait.

2564
02:53:40,510 --> 02:53:40,550
Oh.

2565
02:53:41,750 --> 02:53:41,750
Hello.

2566
02:53:42,670 --> 02:53:43,430
Goodbye.

2567
02:53:48,070 --> 02:53:49,410
I'll see you.

2568
02:53:50,530 --> 02:53:50,770
Goodbye.

2569
02:53:55,370 --> 02:53:56,230
Hey guys, I lived!

2570
02:53:56,690 --> 02:53:56,690
Oh!

2571
02:53:57,150 --> 02:53:57,430
Oh!

2572
02:53:57,750 --> 02:53:58,070
Oh!

2573
02:53:58,770 --> 02:53:59,090
Oh!

2574
02:53:59,550 --> 02:54:00,250
Never mind.

2575
02:54:05,970 --> 02:54:06,890
Never mind.

2576
02:54:07,650 --> 02:54:08,950
Hi, Liv, though.

2577
02:54:11,350 --> 02:54:12,930
They did not live.

2578
02:54:13,610 --> 02:54:15,350
I was like, hey, guys, I'm back, guys.

2579
02:54:15,490 --> 02:54:16,450
What did I miss?

2580
02:54:18,410 --> 02:54:20,310
What did I miss, everybody?

2581
02:54:30,850 --> 02:54:31,990
They got off.

2582
02:54:32,050 --> 02:54:32,850
Yeah, they got off.

2583
02:54:32,950 --> 02:54:34,210
They got off triple support.

2584
02:54:34,270 --> 02:54:34,790
Look at that.

2585
02:54:34,910 --> 02:54:36,170
They got off Spider-Man.

2586
02:54:36,290 --> 02:54:36,690
Look at that.

2587
02:54:36,950 --> 02:54:39,030
I wish our Spider-Man did that!

2588
02:54:39,570 --> 02:54:39,990
Wow!

2589
02:54:42,270 --> 02:54:45,390
That's crazy that our Spider-Man didn't do that.

2590
02:54:47,410 --> 02:54:48,390
Is that crazy?

2591
02:54:49,750 --> 02:54:50,970
What the fuck?

2592
02:54:51,450 --> 02:54:52,970
Oh my...

2593
02:54:52,970 --> 02:54:54,550
Yo, you can use your sword also.

2594
02:54:55,050 --> 02:54:55,870
That's my bad.

2595
02:54:55,950 --> 02:54:56,630
I thought we brought it.

2596
02:55:00,490 --> 02:55:02,850
I was like, where's my...

2597
02:55:02,850 --> 02:55:04,090
Where's my rocket all of it?

2598
02:55:04,270 --> 02:55:05,770
Where did it go?

2599
02:55:06,390 --> 02:55:07,930
Where's my rocket doing?

2600
02:55:09,590 --> 02:55:12,210
I thought my rocket was like my buddy.

2601
02:55:13,570 --> 02:55:14,610
I'm goodbye.

2602
02:55:15,350 --> 02:55:16,810
Hello, goodbye everybody.

2603
02:55:18,270 --> 02:55:19,310
Hello, rocket, please.

2604
02:55:19,710 --> 02:55:20,290
Rocket, what?

2605
02:55:21,390 --> 02:55:22,410
Goodbye, everyone.

2606
02:55:24,690 --> 02:55:25,670
Hello, I'm back.

2607
02:55:27,030 --> 02:55:27,650
That's crazy.

2608
02:55:27,850 --> 02:55:29,710
He just swam right past 20 of us.

2609
02:55:30,370 --> 02:55:32,090
That's actually crazy.

2610
02:55:34,270 --> 02:55:35,530
They only have trains.

2611
02:55:35,670 --> 02:55:36,130
Lunar first.

2612
02:55:38,370 --> 02:55:39,450
It's insane.

2613
02:55:42,250 --> 02:55:43,050
Oh my.

2614
02:55:44,550 --> 02:55:45,790
We can do it.

2615
02:55:47,790 --> 02:55:48,510
It's okay.

2616
02:55:49,430 --> 02:55:51,110
Oh, it's no longer okay.

2617
02:55:52,870 --> 02:55:53,950
It's no longer...

2618
02:55:53,950 --> 02:55:55,510
I was not standing in there.

2619
02:55:55,730 --> 02:55:56,130
I'm sorry.

2620
02:55:56,330 --> 02:55:57,390
I was not...

2621
02:55:57,390 --> 02:56:00,210
There was absolutely no way I was standing in that.

2622
02:56:05,450 --> 02:56:06,570
Okay, we're dead.

2623
02:56:08,670 --> 02:56:11,190
Wait, how is our rocket still have all?

2624
02:56:11,550 --> 02:56:13,230
How does our rocket still have all?

2625
02:56:13,570 --> 02:56:16,230
I don't understand.

2626
02:56:20,290 --> 02:56:21,830
How does our rocket still have your all?

2627
02:56:22,890 --> 02:56:24,410
Time to switch things up.

2628
02:56:25,290 --> 02:56:27,610
Yeah, he's been holding all through three fights.

2629
02:56:28,830 --> 02:56:29,510
I'm Luna Snow.

2630
02:56:30,210 --> 02:56:34,250
like the moon i shine in darkness we're keeping this calm

2631
02:56:37,930 --> 02:57:06,430
okay no it's not rocket that's the it's not jeff that's the counter to triple support it was literally their team actually swapped off with spider my team didn't swap off with spider i have to say luna for altron the altron literally cannot play if i don't play luna It's literally our,

2632
02:57:06,430 --> 02:57:11,990
our team's just playing triple support wrong because our rocket has never ulted.

2633
02:57:13,450 --> 02:57:17,630
Also rocket is not normally not the rocket is normally not the support you play with triple support.

2634
02:57:18,410 --> 02:57:22,710
You play Jeff or Jeff Mantis or like literally everything but rocket.

2635
02:57:24,810 --> 02:57:31,290
Literally you play you play everything but rocket for triple support is usually Jeff Mantis or Adam.

2636
02:57:32,290 --> 02:57:32,570
Jeff Matt.

2637
02:57:32,710 --> 02:57:32,850
Yeah.

2638
02:57:33,310 --> 02:57:48,670
with it yeah well she did he didn't even oh that's the thing also apparently the left side is troll now you go right you have to heal here left side is troll here nobody stands there anymore

2639
02:57:51,910 --> 02:58:03,830
Nokia um Loki works in triple uh if you have Adam um just because like Loki is so bad as a duo support now I just wanted to kill that venom.

2640
02:58:04,430 --> 02:58:05,790
Like, fuck that guy in particular.

2641
02:58:07,690 --> 02:58:12,590
It was technically a troll using my clap there.

2642
02:58:13,430 --> 02:58:15,330
There was no reason to use it.

2643
02:58:19,810 --> 02:58:22,930
Also, we did not save any alt for the Jeff up.

2644
02:58:23,710 --> 02:58:28,850
Like, we literally, all we did was just, like, we never Jeff ulted them.

2645
02:58:32,550 --> 02:58:33,110
Okay.

2646
02:58:33,250 --> 02:58:34,450
Oh my god, I tried.

2647
02:58:34,590 --> 02:58:36,550
I swear to god.

2648
02:58:45,250 --> 02:58:45,690
Nice.

2649
02:58:47,570 --> 02:58:49,010
Oh, I missed the freeze.

2650
02:58:49,150 --> 02:58:49,690
That's unlucky.

2651
02:58:52,290 --> 02:58:53,290
That's so unlucky.

2652
02:58:53,510 --> 02:58:55,530
Okay, do we have any up for it?

2653
02:58:55,790 --> 02:58:58,210
Do we... Oh, do we have... Oh, nice.

2654
02:58:58,230 --> 02:58:58,930
See, there you go.

2655
02:58:58,970 --> 02:58:59,170
See?

2656
02:58:59,530 --> 02:59:00,450
That's how you do it.

2657
02:59:02,270 --> 02:59:03,890
Okay, now... Oh, shit!

2658
02:59:04,110 --> 02:59:04,930
That was crazy!

2659
02:59:05,830 --> 02:59:06,710
Oh my god!

2660
02:59:07,530 --> 02:59:08,650
That's actually crazy.

2661
02:59:09,130 --> 02:59:10,030
That was insane.

2662
02:59:12,690 --> 02:59:15,430
Yeah, I was gonna say, are we really just letting him walk up to me like that?

2663
02:59:17,130 --> 02:59:19,730
Oh my god, here you go.

2664
02:59:20,890 --> 02:59:21,270
I'm up.

2665
02:59:22,110 --> 02:59:23,030
I had to use that.

2666
02:59:23,150 --> 02:59:25,630
He's still at Strange Alt, though, so GG's.

2667
02:59:26,230 --> 02:59:27,370
Good luck, everyone.

2668
02:59:30,210 --> 02:59:30,570
Alright.

2669
02:59:36,930 --> 02:59:39,970
I got a little confused because there's so many things on my screen.

2670
02:59:40,950 --> 02:59:56,010

2673
03:00:17,210 --> 03:00:18,630
Goodbye, this is where I died.

2674
03:00:18,850 --> 03:00:19,410
This is where I...

2675
03:00:19,410 --> 03:00:21,750
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

2676
03:00:22,590 --> 03:00:23,890
Yes, thank you.

2677
03:00:24,850 --> 03:00:26,850
See, this is how you were supposed to play.

2678
03:00:26,890 --> 03:00:27,410
I'll try.

2679
03:00:30,270 --> 03:00:32,670
That's basically how you just...

2680
03:00:32,670 --> 03:00:33,310
You just...

2681
03:00:33,310 --> 03:00:34,450
Why did he go here?

2682
03:00:35,910 --> 03:00:38,550
You save your ult for the Jeff look.

2683
03:00:38,830 --> 03:00:41,410
He has strange ult, so...

2684
03:00:41,410 --> 03:00:42,110
I'm scared.

2685
03:00:43,370 --> 03:00:44,690
Only 60 seconds left.

2686
03:00:44,750 --> 03:00:46,470
There's no way they don't TP.

2687
03:00:46,970 --> 03:00:47,730
I feel like they're going to TP.

2688
03:00:50,670 --> 03:00:51,750
They have to be TPing.

2689
03:00:55,630 --> 03:00:56,190
Oh, what?

2690
03:00:57,250 --> 03:00:58,910
Why did they wait so long?

2691
03:01:01,090 --> 03:01:01,810
I had to go.

2692
03:01:02,130 --> 03:01:02,950
Put some sand here.

2693
03:01:08,790 --> 03:01:09,230
Yo!

2694
03:01:09,610 --> 03:01:09,890
Whoa!

2695
03:01:13,900 --> 03:01:15,160
I told you, you're left!

2696
03:01:21,060 --> 03:01:23,120
Alright, this is where they strange, y'all.

2697
03:01:23,580 --> 03:01:24,920
This is where it happens.

2698
03:01:26,820 --> 03:01:27,660
This is where...

2699
03:01:30,040 --> 03:01:32,440
I told you.

2700
03:01:34,920 --> 03:01:35,440
No!

2701
03:01:35,880 --> 03:01:36,080
No!

2702
03:01:36,420 --> 03:01:36,760
No!

2703
03:01:37,460 --> 03:01:37,500
No!

2704
03:01:37,500 --> 03:01:39,180
Where do I go?

2705
03:01:39,980 --> 03:01:41,460
Where do I go?

2706
03:01:44,220 --> 03:01:46,620
Wow, we won that.

2707
03:01:46,800 --> 03:01:48,840
Where do we go?

2708
03:01:50,480 --> 03:01:52,900
I wanted to kill the Luna.

2709
03:01:54,640 --> 03:01:55,160
Fear.

2710
03:01:55,660 --> 03:01:57,560
There was nowhere to go.

2711
03:01:57,680 --> 03:02:00,220
I just had to make sure I wasn't with anyone else.

2712
03:02:02,260 --> 03:02:03,680
At least I would.

2713
03:02:04,780 --> 03:02:06,660
So I'm still a win.

2714
03:02:06,980 --> 03:02:08,500
I was gonna kill her.

2715
03:02:08,620 --> 03:02:11,340
And then the mag sucked up my fucking shots.

2716
03:02:12,020 --> 03:02:14,480
Literally, she was right in front of me.

2717
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:19,200
She like sucked it up like a greedy...

2718
03:02:19,200 --> 03:02:21,700
He like sucked it up like a greedy bitch.

2719
03:02:22,220 --> 03:02:23,120
A greedy whore.

2720
03:02:29,270 --> 03:02:30,210
God damn.

2721
03:02:31,150 --> 03:02:32,290
That's why you got kicked out.

2722
03:02:32,470 --> 03:02:34,790
And you gotta live in your own little mutant island.

2723
03:02:38,770 --> 03:02:40,290
Wait, what else do I have?

2724
03:02:40,450 --> 03:02:41,230
Oh, I have this.

2725
03:02:42,110 --> 03:02:44,990
I think Manchester's thing is the new venom.

2726
03:02:47,450 --> 03:02:47,930

2727
03:02:48,810 --> 03:02:49,330

03:04:00,790 --> 03:04:01,130
Cat.

2735
03:04:03,790 --> 03:04:05,490
He needed the little inspiration.

2736
03:04:08,030 --> 03:04:09,990
Bro, he's Peter.

2737
03:04:10,670 --> 03:04:11,670
Peter Quill.

2738
03:04:12,910 --> 03:04:14,230
That is your step...

2739
03:04:14,230 --> 03:04:15,650
No, step... Oh, wait, that is.

2740
03:04:15,830 --> 03:04:18,850
That is your half-sister, though.

2741
03:04:19,450 --> 03:04:21,810
That's half- inbreeding.

2742
03:04:22,630 --> 03:04:25,270
It's not... It's like a little worse.

2743
03:04:26,390 --> 03:04:28,210
Sweet home, all of

2744
03:04:32,110 --> 03:04:33,990
It's not full inbreeding.

2745
03:04:34,290 --> 03:04:34,850
It's half.

2746
03:04:36,350 --> 03:04:40,190
It's not any better, but it's half worse.

2747
03:04:45,130 --> 03:04:46,690
To keep bullies.

2748
03:04:54,390 --> 03:04:56,590
Sweet home space Alabama.

2749
03:05:03,990 --> 03:05:05,750
I'm fucking getting it.

2750
03:05:05,770 --> 03:05:06,950
Emma out of the game.

2751
03:05:07,870 --> 03:05:11,370
Because we don't have anyone that plays Emma.

2752
03:05:11,950 --> 03:05:12,670
Might as well.

2753
03:05:15,750 --> 03:05:16,990
It's the only way.

2754
03:05:21,210 --> 03:05:23,370
That's our Yoshi, folks.

2755
03:05:23,510 --> 03:05:24,150
Yeah, it's me.

2756
03:05:25,170 --> 03:05:25,970
Oh, my God.

2757
03:05:26,190 --> 03:05:27,470
Okay, triple support.

2758
03:05:29,830 --> 03:05:31,690
I have to play Luna with this.

2759
03:05:32,390 --> 03:05:35,650
Um, I play Luna or Invis.

Just a little.

2804
03:08:42,360 --> 03:08:43,400
Wait, where's our mantis?

2805
03:08:43,820 --> 03:08:45,020
Oh, he's going to get spawn camp.

2806
03:08:45,140 --> 03:08:46,060
We all know it.

2807
03:08:48,820 --> 03:08:50,040
I don't worry.

2808
03:08:50,280 --> 03:08:50,800
I got you.

2809
03:08:50,920 --> 03:08:54,420
Okay, I have to make sure our Mantis doesn't get spawned camp.

2810
03:08:55,640 --> 03:08:57,060
I was a little scared for him.

2811
03:08:58,060 --> 03:09:00,420
They have Spider-Man ult, so...

2812
03:09:01,880 --> 03:09:03,460
Okay, it's okay.

2813
03:09:04,400 --> 03:09:05,020
It's okay.

2814
03:09:06,220 --> 03:09:08,240
It's not the best.

2815
03:09:08,820 --> 03:09:10,920
Wait, how did our Groot get over there?

2816
03:09:11,800 --> 03:09:13,480
I'm a little scared.

2817
03:09:16,580 --> 03:09:17,180
Oh.

2818
03:09:18,040 --> 03:09:18,640
Hello.

2819
03:09:19,220 --> 03:09:19,820
Hello.

2820
03:09:20,940 --> 03:09:21,560
I...

2821
03:09:21,560 --> 03:09:21,680
Woo!

2822
03:09:27,700 --> 03:09:28,320
Um...

2823
03:09:29,040 --> 03:09:29,660
Um...

2824
03:09:29,660 --> 03:09:30,100
Um...

2825
03:09:30,100 --> 03:09:30,840
Um...

2826
03:09:30,840 --> 03:09:31,320
Um...

2827
03:09:31,320 --> 03:09:31,520
Um...

2828
03:09:31,520 --> 03:09:32,900
Yeah, no, I...

2829
03:09:32,900 --> 03:09:39,240
Unless our Jeff had the fucking best all of his life, we were not living that.

2830
03:09:39,420 --> 03:09:39,580
Nope.

2831
03:09:41,140 --> 03:09:42,640
Uh, is anyone TPing?

2832
03:09:43,140 --> 03:09:43,880
Do we have it?

2833
03:09:44,020 --> 03:09:44,300
Oh.

2834
03:09:45,480 --> 03:09:46,260
No TP.

2835
03:09:46,720 --> 03:09:48,380
No TP, apparently.

2836
03:09:50,780 --> 03:09:51,900
No, no!

2837
03:09:54,360 --> 03:09:55,680
I should have put a clone.

2838
03:09:56,440 --> 03:09:57,640
I should have put a clone.

2839
03:09:57,880 --> 03:09:58,880
All right, I'm back on clone.

2840
03:10:00,180 --> 03:10:01,560
I didn't put a clone.

2841
03:10:02,960 --> 03:10:04,820
Oh my gosh, I've been invisible women for this.

2842
03:10:05,200 --> 03:10:07,340
Can't get me if I'm over here.

2843
03:10:11,180 --> 03:10:11,980
Oh, that's unlucky.

2844
03:10:12,960 --> 03:10:14,200
Oh, that's unlucky.

2845
03:10:14,440 --> 03:10:14,700
Goodbye.

2846
03:10:16,900 --> 03:10:17,380
Goodbye.

2847
03:10:24,210 --> 03:10:26,790
Get out of here.

2848
03:10:27,450 --> 03:10:28,110
Fucking loser.

2849
03:10:28,730 --> 03:10:30,410
Oh no, he's getting out.

2850
03:10:35,210 --> 03:10:35,870
No, I'm not.

2851
03:10:36,890 --> 03:10:38,350
Okay, I could play.

2852
03:10:38,750 --> 03:10:42,770
Okay, technically I could play Invis.

2853
03:10:47,730 --> 03:10:49,510
I could.

2854
03:10:53,790 --> 03:10:54,710
Technically.

2855
03:10:57,170 --> 03:10:57,770
Nice.

2856
03:10:59,930 --> 03:11:00,790
Is it?

2857
03:11:01,130 --> 03:11:01,810
Should I?

2858
03:11:01,950 --> 03:11:02,350
Would I?

2859
03:11:05,790 --> 03:11:09,450
But like, I had, I played during the last game.

2860
03:11:09,670 --> 03:11:12,070
I did my, I did my job.

2861
03:11:14,750 --> 03:11:15,790
Oh, he's fine.

2862
03:11:18,950 --> 03:11:20,150
All right.

2863
03:11:24,690 --> 03:11:26,670
Whoa, who is he messing?

2864
03:11:29,670 --> 03:11:32,950
Who is he trying to mess with?

2865
03:11:33,310 --> 03:11:34,850
Guess we'll never know.

2866
03:11:35,970 --> 03:11:37,010
I guess.

2867
03:11:37,530 --> 03:11:39,150
Guess we'll never know.

2868
03:11:40,130 --> 03:11:40,430
Damn.

2869
03:11:41,270 --> 03:11:43,030
Don't mess with Pooh again?

2870
03:11:44,870 --> 03:11:45,130
Who?

2871
03:11:50,030 --> 03:11:51,150
Not quite.

2872
03:11:51,330 --> 03:11:52,150
Oh shit, fuck.

2873
03:11:53,810 --> 03:11:55,990
Let's use everything!

2874
03:11:56,550 --> 03:11:56,850
Fuck it!

2875
03:11:57,470 --> 03:11:58,090
Yay!

2876
03:12:00,430 --> 03:12:10,290
You know what, I just felt like, yeah, you know, usually, usually I'd be like, hey, I'll first, but I felt, I felt so quirky.

2877
03:12:11,970 --> 03:12:13,210
Everyone press Q.

2878
03:12:13,790 --> 03:12:17,190
Yeah, um, that's a little awkward.

2879
03:12:20,150 --> 03:12:20,830
Oops.

2880
03:12:21,850 --> 03:12:24,490
That's not what was supposed to happen.

2881
03:12:25,530 --> 03:12:27,710
That is.

2882
03:12:29,950 --> 03:12:33,430
We were like, what if we all just press Q?

2883
03:12:34,370 --> 03:12:36,930
Like, what would happen if, you know?

2884
03:12:38,930 --> 03:12:40,650
What could happen?

2885
03:12:41,470 --> 03:12:42,110
Oh, nice.

2886
03:12:42,350 --> 03:12:43,590
That was a nice little, actually.

2887
03:12:44,370 --> 03:12:45,070
That was insane.

2888
03:12:46,510 --> 03:12:48,010
Oh, look, the Spider-Man swapped out.

2889
03:12:48,130 --> 03:12:48,510
Yeah, see?

2890
03:12:48,610 --> 03:12:49,730
Not so fun now.

2891
03:12:50,330 --> 03:12:50,910
Yeah, right.

2892
03:12:50,990 --> 03:12:51,570
Yeah, see?

2893
03:12:51,990 --> 03:12:53,230
Not so fun.

2894
03:12:57,110 --> 03:12:58,670
That took you, right?

2895
03:12:59,730 --> 03:13:00,930
That's right.

2896
03:13:01,590 --> 03:13:03,270
Fucking sucks, doesn't it?

2897
03:13:05,630 --> 03:13:06,010
Oh.

2898
03:13:06,750 --> 03:13:08,390
That guy definitely has a...

2899
03:13:08,390 --> 03:13:09,710
Who wants to do something?

2900
03:13:11,330 --> 03:13:13,430
Oh my god.

2901
03:13:13,770 --> 03:13:15,030
Oh my god.

2902
03:13:15,110 --> 03:13:16,050
Goodbye, everybody.

2903
03:13:16,570 --> 03:13:17,910
That's their turn.

2904
03:13:18,690 --> 03:13:20,290
Now they press everything.

2905
03:13:23,130 --> 03:13:23,510
Yeah, I know.

2906
03:13:23,610 --> 03:13:25,250
That was, like, five volts.

2907
03:13:25,970 --> 03:13:26,730
Did they use Moon Knight?

2908
03:13:26,810 --> 03:13:27,270
I don't know.

2909
03:13:27,430 --> 03:13:28,410
I know they used Punisher.

2910
03:13:28,810 --> 03:13:29,450
Strange.

2911
03:13:33,630 --> 03:14:01,370
uh that's crazy all right it's okay we still have our cues oh nice don't worry that's somewhere yeah see i knew it aim that's somewhere i think i think i think i hit something huge that's right I could be that.

2912
03:14:03,990 --> 03:14:05,430
Time to switch things up.

2913
03:14:05,910 --> 03:14:07,550
Including which side you're on.

2914
03:14:09,610 --> 03:14:12,350
I hate random bullshit, time.

2915
03:14:13,890 --> 03:14:15,150
It's the worst.

2916
03:14:18,830 --> 03:14:19,310
Yeah.

2917
03:14:21,470 --> 03:14:22,830
This game is so easy.

2918
03:14:26,590 --> 03:14:29,510
So easy when you don't have to aim.

2919
03:14:29,650 --> 03:14:30,210
Yay!

2920
03:14:31,950 --> 03:14:33,870
I love your hate!

2921
03:14:37,710 --> 03:14:38,710
Yay!

2922
03:14:41,290 --> 03:14:43,550
Hate only makes me stronger.

2923
03:14:45,830 --> 03:14:45,970
Real.

2924
03:14:47,070 --> 03:14:48,910
I can only get stronger.

2925
03:14:49,370 --> 03:14:50,330
The more I hate.

2926
03:14:51,110 --> 03:14:52,110
Keep hating.

2927
03:14:52,690 --> 03:14:54,510
I only hate watch.

2928
03:15:01,660 --> 03:15:02,660
Yippee!

2929
03:15:07,880 --> 03:15:09,360
That's exactly right.

2930
03:15:09,660 --> 03:15:10,820
Hate fuels me.

2931
03:15:13,040 --> 03:15:14,680
It makes me strong.

2932
03:15:16,680 --> 03:15:17,920
Give in to the hate.

2933
03:15:19,860 --> 03:15:20,420
Do it.

2934
03:15:22,620 --> 03:15:23,540
Alright, here you go.

2935
03:15:24,040 --> 03:15:25,460
If they play close...

2936
03:15:25,460 --> 03:15:26,820
Oh, there's Penny.

2937
03:15:27,920 --> 03:15:30,000
Okay, they have a Penny.

2938
03:15:30,620 --> 03:15:34,440
I don't know if I should play close.

2939
03:15:34,840 --> 03:15:35,020
I...

2940
03:15:37,100 --> 03:15:39,460
Okay, give me a sec.

2941
03:15:39,600 --> 03:15:40,140
I swap.

2942
03:15:40,760 --> 03:15:44,200
I ain't, I ain't playing that.

2943
03:15:45,360 --> 03:15:47,500
I'm not playing that.

2944
03:15:49,760 --> 03:15:50,920
There's no reason.

2945
03:15:54,840 --> 03:15:57,300
Yeah, I'm not dealing with that.

2946
03:16:01,140 --> 03:16:02,600
Like, I'm not crazy.

2947
03:16:04,640 --> 03:16:05,000
Yeah.

2948
03:16:10,440 --> 03:16:12,120
I like that shit.

2949
03:16:13,140 --> 03:16:13,880
Fuck that.

2950
03:16:16,060 --> 03:16:18,200
See, that could have been me, guys.

2951
03:16:23,030 --> 03:16:24,150
That could have been me.

2952
03:16:24,910 --> 03:16:27,850
Yeah, I was gonna say I'm not dealing with the penny mines there.

2953
03:16:31,030 --> 03:16:32,690
I'm not dealing with the penny mines.

2954
03:16:32,850 --> 03:16:33,770
Oh my god, they're running.

2955
03:16:33,910 --> 03:16:34,550
I should have went ultra.

2956
03:16:34,690 --> 03:16:37,050
I can't go ultra because we don't have Luna.

2957
03:16:39,230 --> 03:16:39,870
There we go.

2958
03:16:45,650 --> 03:16:52,310
oh my god please

2959
03:16:55,690 --> 03:16:57,790

2960
03:17:01,070 --> 03:17:59,760

2962
03:18:14,400 --> 03:18:15,080
It's unlucky.

2963
03:18:20,710 --> 03:18:21,270
Jesus Christ.

2964
03:18:21,870 --> 03:18:22,130
Nice.

2965
03:18:22,730 --> 03:18:24,430
I'm scared of just the mines.

2966
03:18:24,710 --> 03:18:25,090
That's it.

2967
03:18:25,590 --> 03:18:27,550
I need to try to make sure I don't...

2968
03:18:27,550 --> 03:18:29,010
I don't stand on the mines.

2969
03:18:32,370 --> 03:18:32,990
There we go.

2970
03:18:36,390 --> 03:18:37,350
I'll push.

2971
03:18:43,930 --> 03:18:45,670
Oh, he went the other way.

2972
03:18:47,490 --> 03:18:47,970
Oh,

2973
03:18:51,130 --> 03:18:52,090
that's right, bitch.

2974
03:18:52,770 --> 03:18:53,650
Get edged.

2975
03:18:54,310 --> 03:18:56,030
But, like, parable rivals first.

2976
03:18:56,170 --> 03:18:56,950
Okay, guys, guys.

2977
03:18:57,230 --> 03:18:58,290
Guys, I just realized what I said.

2978
03:19:04,290 --> 03:19:08,230
But, like, in-game, in-game, in-game, esport terms.

2979
03:19:11,390 --> 03:19:13,430
All three of us stand there.

2980
03:19:14,090 --> 03:19:15,090
We should be fine.

2981
03:19:17,050 --> 03:19:17,610
Yay!

2982
03:19:20,330 --> 03:19:23,990
No, it's not November yet.

2983
03:19:29,450 --> 03:19:30,730
End game, end game.

2984
03:19:32,350 --> 03:19:33,510
Alright, I think I need one more.

2985
03:19:34,410 --> 03:19:34,670
Alright?

2986
03:19:42,930 --> 03:19:45,470
I just need one more, and then I'm GM too.

2987
03:19:47,290 --> 03:19:47,990
One more!

2988
03:19:48,130 --> 03:19:49,950
And then the last streak starts here.

2989
03:19:50,850 --> 03:19:54,610
It's always when the closest you are, the harder you fall.

2990
03:20:00,930 --> 03:20:08,850
all right give me a sec i gotta pee i'll be back don't worry i got you it's dessert time

2991
03:21:14,940 --> 03:21:29,820
this is why you watch my content this is the real show this is this is the real show not not the fucking gameplay yeah i get it i got you guys i know what you're into

2992
03:21:35,320 --> 03:21:38,520
One may feel empathy for an enemy and still destroy them.

2993
03:21:38,560 --> 03:21:42,300
I think Mantis is like the new Venom.

2994
03:21:43,320 --> 03:21:45,700
Venom is now a dying species.

2995
03:21:47,580 --> 03:21:48,940
The twerking Venom.

2996
03:21:51,120 --> 03:21:52,220
Hello everyone!

2997
03:21:54,020 --> 03:21:54,380
Hello!

2998
03:21:54,620 --> 03:21:55,060
Oh!

2999
03:21:55,580 --> 03:21:56,480
That's right.

3000
03:21:56,540 --> 03:21:58,300
I steal your man.

3001
03:22:00,680 --> 03:22:01,780
That's right.

3002
03:22:02,280 --> 03:22:03,900
I steal your man.

3003
03:22:05,320 --> 03:22:08,100
That's right, he ain't moving.

3004
03:22:08,500 --> 03:22:08,520
Yeah.

3005
03:22:11,880 --> 03:22:12,860
That's okay.

3006
03:22:13,260 --> 03:22:14,220
Oh shit.

3007
03:22:14,800 --> 03:22:15,360
Whoa.

3008
03:22:17,000 --> 03:22:17,560
Damage.

3009
03:22:19,560 --> 03:22:20,720
It's like, oh shit.

3010
03:22:22,920 --> 03:22:25,900
Hey, do you have it?

3011
03:22:26,520 --> 03:22:26,900
I'm not kidding.

3012
03:22:26,900 --> 03:22:27,280
Wait, I don't play volleyball.

3013
03:22:27,420 --> 03:22:27,620
What?

3014
03:22:28,200 --> 03:22:29,060
What the fuck?

3015
03:22:29,360 --> 03:22:30,540
Oh, wait, I have that too.

3016
03:22:30,640 --> 03:22:31,340
Watch this.

3017
03:22:32,280 --> 03:22:33,040
Double volleyball.

3018
03:22:33,200 --> 03:22:34,480
Come on, who wants to go?

3019
03:22:34,660 --> 03:22:35,140
Come on.

3020
03:22:35,140 --> 03:22:41,920

3022
03:23:07,040 --> 03:23:07,720
Run.

3023
03:23:09,940 --> 03:23:11,980
I thought it was auto!

3024
03:23:12,760 --> 03:23:16,800
I didn't know I had to manually hit back!

3025
03:23:18,940 --> 03:23:20,560
It's okay, I ran away.

3026
03:23:21,300 --> 03:23:22,600
They'll never find me.

3027
03:23:22,940 --> 03:23:23,900
I ran away.

3028
03:23:27,770 --> 03:23:29,710
There's so many Angela's.

3029
03:23:30,130 --> 03:23:31,910
Didn't even know it was fucking dog shit.

3030
03:23:32,670 --> 03:23:33,690
They'll never know.

3031
03:23:34,490 --> 03:23:37,170
Who am I going to banish this match?

3032
03:23:37,710 --> 03:23:39,090
I ran away.

3033
03:23:42,410 --> 03:23:44,150
They'll never know what I did.

3034
03:23:47,470 --> 03:23:47,690
Torch.

3035
03:23:50,830 --> 03:23:51,930
Oh, bucky.

3036
03:23:56,710 --> 03:23:58,670
In before they ban Torch too.

3037
03:23:59,150 --> 03:23:59,410
Yeah!

3038
03:24:00,230 --> 03:24:01,230
And then I'll ban Emma.

3039
03:24:07,170 --> 03:24:07,950
I'll ban Emma.

3040
03:24:08,230 --> 03:24:09,310
Just because we have...

3041
03:24:09,310 --> 03:24:10,370
We're running...

3042
03:24:10,390 --> 03:24:11,470
mag, Angela.

3043
03:24:14,870 --> 03:24:16,670
It's only natural.

3044
03:24:25,140 --> 03:24:26,540
Bum, bum, bum.

3045
03:24:27,200 --> 03:24:28,660
But I don't...

3046
03:24:29,880 --> 03:24:31,600
We both had the same idea.

3047
03:24:33,040 --> 03:24:34,800
That means both teams are not playing Emma.

3048
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:37,860
Both teams didn't want to play Emma then.

3049
03:24:38,460 --> 03:24:38,760
I don't know.

3050
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:39,640
I have to play.

3051
03:24:40,100 --> 03:24:41,020
I don't know for this.

3052
03:24:44,600 --> 03:24:46,220
I guess I'll give it to Panther.

3053
03:24:47,820 --> 03:24:49,020
No, she's not...

3054
03:24:49,020 --> 03:24:50,900
I don't think she's good in higher, Elo.

3055
03:24:51,880 --> 03:24:53,480
I personally don't think so.

3056
03:24:54,820 --> 03:24:56,260
But in this...

3057
03:24:56,260 --> 03:24:57,660
Elo, technically...

3058
03:24:58,680 --> 03:25:01,020
It's still the Wild Wild West, technically.

3059
03:25:04,580 --> 03:25:06,060
Because of the Rank Reset.

3060
03:25:07,060 --> 03:25:09,640
The Rank Reset just makes this the Wild Wild West.

3061
03:25:17,140 --> 03:25:19,320
No, I'm dual Doom Keeling.

3062
03:25:19,800 --> 03:25:20,960
It's still Doom Keeling.

3063
03:25:21,480 --> 03:25:23,740
But it's just a duo of Doom Q.

3064
03:25:28,880 --> 03:25:29,100
Yay.

3065
03:25:38,470 --> 03:25:40,010
Where's my dancing mode?

3066
03:25:40,130 --> 03:25:41,570
Why is there no dancing mode for Luna?

3067
03:25:41,710 --> 03:25:43,930
She's literally an idol.

3068
03:25:44,490 --> 03:25:46,730
I have a DJ.

3069
03:25:47,550 --> 03:25:49,550
That's actually crazy now that I think about it.

3070
03:25:51,070 --> 03:25:53,190
She's an idol and yet she doesn't have a dancing mode.

3071
03:25:55,470 --> 03:25:59,130
Yeah, but I want to dance when I don't have a...

3072
03:25:59,130 --> 03:26:00,810
What if I just want to dance?

3073
03:26:01,250 --> 03:26:03,210
Am I not allowed to just dance?

3074
03:26:07,030 --> 03:26:09,550
Why is my dancing paywalled?

3075
03:26:11,850 --> 03:26:17,110
I don't like that my invis is like so deep in.

3076
03:26:18,330 --> 03:26:19,870
What is that rock?

3077
03:26:20,250 --> 03:26:22,290
Oh my god, that rocket was fucking god, I was gonna say.

3078
03:26:22,370 --> 03:26:23,810
What is my mag doing?

3079
03:26:26,090 --> 03:26:27,910
What is she doing?

3080
03:26:30,110 --> 03:26:34,330
Okay, I'm a little concerned because our mag just played ultra high grass.

3081
03:26:34,530 --> 03:26:38,050
Like, I got, I was confused.

3082
03:26:39,070 --> 03:26:40,870
I was like, the entire team is below.

3083
03:26:47,310 --> 03:26:48,390
She's a pro.

3084
03:26:48,570 --> 03:26:50,970
She doesn't dance for free.

3085
03:26:51,910 --> 03:26:52,490
True.

3086
03:26:53,210 --> 03:26:54,850
That's why, yeah, that's why I want to pay for you.

3087
03:26:54,870 --> 03:27:06,010
I want to pay so I can pay so I can't I feel like I might oh my gosh my Invis is not I'm trying to play with my Invis as much as I can because like I'm

3088
03:27:09,870 --> 03:27:16,130
scared oh my god oh my god please

3089
03:27:24,130 --> 03:27:31,950
someone help us I swear to God the Invis and I I'm sorry, Infus dropped down.

3090
03:27:35,170 --> 03:27:36,270
Oh my god.

3091
03:27:36,730 --> 03:27:38,850
He just walked up to us.

3092
03:27:43,980 --> 03:27:45,000
Alright, that's fine.

3093
03:27:45,960 --> 03:27:48,580
I was gonna say, why the fuck did we just let him do that?

3094
03:27:49,080 --> 03:27:50,120
I'm sorry.

3095
03:27:52,560 --> 03:27:54,020
It's fine, we got him.

3096
03:27:55,160 --> 03:27:57,240
They have Penny ult, though.

3097
03:27:59,300 --> 03:27:59,900
That...

3098
03:27:59,900 --> 03:28:00,200
Okay.

3099
03:28:01,140 --> 03:28:02,180
That, okay.

3100
03:28:03,900 --> 03:28:05,300
We'll take it.

3101
03:28:10,490 --> 03:28:12,810
I'm a little scared.

3102
03:28:14,290 --> 03:28:18,310
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, I just made it.

3103
03:28:19,850 --> 03:28:22,650
Alright, but I don't know we can live through that.

3104
03:28:22,810 --> 03:28:25,750
Okay, I slowly back the way.

3105
03:28:27,030 --> 03:28:28,570
I'm slowly back.

3106
03:28:28,850 --> 03:28:32,490
Oh my god.

3107
03:28:32,510 --> 03:28:34,190
My god, I'm clapping.

3108
03:28:34,470 --> 03:28:35,510
I'm clapping.

3109
03:28:35,910 --> 03:28:36,170
I'm clapping.

3110
03:28:36,250 --> 03:28:36,930
I'm clap.

3111
03:28:37,070 --> 03:28:39,470
I don't know what else I could do.

3112
03:28:39,670 --> 03:28:40,910
I don't know what else I could do.

3113
03:28:41,210 --> 03:28:42,190
I clap.

3114
03:28:48,670 --> 03:28:52,690
Okay, um Hmm

3115
03:28:57,290 --> 03:29:05,210
Um Clap and I clap the way Clapy, clapy.

3116
03:29:09,400 --> 03:29:11,820
Alright, now we have one thing.

3117
03:29:13,960 --> 03:29:15,640
I don't even know what to...

3118
03:29:18,900 --> 03:29:20,700
I looked at my chat.

3119
03:29:23,020 --> 03:29:24,580
I can't justify it.

3120
03:29:25,160 --> 03:29:26,860
I was looking at my chat there.

3121
03:29:27,920 --> 03:29:30,420
Oh my god, my Invis was in front of me.

3122
03:29:32,500 --> 03:29:33,800
That was my bad.

3123
03:29:35,320 --> 03:29:37,340
I should maybe pay attention.

3124
03:29:38,460 --> 03:29:44,500
No, I think I think this is maybe a Chichiko next.

3125
03:29:44,960 --> 03:29:45,500
Just a maybe.

3126
03:29:45,760 --> 03:29:48,760
I think maybe the enemy team is a little better than us.

3127
03:29:49,460 --> 03:29:54,000
Just just a little bit.

3128
03:29:57,040 --> 03:29:59,320
I can't play Cloak because they wouldn't go Penny.

3129
03:30:00,160 --> 03:30:01,140
I can't play it.

3130
03:30:01,340 --> 03:30:03,640
It's literally Luna's Invisory Cloak.

3131
03:30:05,040 --> 03:30:26,120
I'm Luna snow like the moon I shine we could play triple We could Triple support is the only thing I can think of that might work Why the fuck are you playing Iron Man if you're gonna play Iron Man just play ultra Like literally if you're gonna play trip if you're gonna play Iron Man,

3132
03:30:26,120 --> 03:30:34,360
you know what's like Iron Man and also does heals and damage like ultra Please don't there's no way I can do this without him

3133
03:30:38,660 --> 03:30:40,640
That's literally all we have to do.

3134
03:30:45,540 --> 03:30:46,980
I got a sip in time.

3135
03:30:48,040 --> 03:30:48,780
Should be fine.

3136
03:30:50,360 --> 03:30:51,580
Ultroner is literally better Ironman.

3137
03:30:51,660 --> 03:30:53,740
Why would you be willing to play Ironman when you could just play Ultron?

3138
03:30:56,760 --> 03:30:58,340
He's literally the perfect being.

3139
03:31:04,070 --> 03:31:05,570
That's why it doesn't make sense.

3140
03:31:07,850 --> 03:31:10,590
Why play this when you can play a better character?

3141
03:31:12,370 --> 03:31:14,070
You're saying he didn't get that?

3142
03:31:17,270 --> 03:31:19,770
Why is our arm man there?

3143
03:31:20,730 --> 03:31:21,490
Oh, shit.

3144
03:31:21,850 --> 03:31:22,730
Why was I there?

3145
03:31:25,710 --> 03:31:26,130
Okay.

3146
03:31:32,770 --> 03:31:34,690
I'm so paranoid when I see the web.

3147
03:31:35,450 --> 03:31:39,350
I feel like the web traps are right there.

3148
03:31:40,970 --> 03:31:42,450
I literally was like, hey, guys.

3149
03:31:43,130 --> 03:31:45,230
Hey, what are you guys doing?

3150
03:31:50,720 --> 03:31:52,560
What are you guys doing over there, huh?

3151
03:31:55,280 --> 03:31:56,140
You having fun?

3152
03:32:01,800 --> 03:32:02,300
Oh my god.

3153
03:32:03,880 --> 03:32:05,680
Oh my god, okay, this is like...

3154
03:32:06,460 --> 03:32:07,480
I don't know.

3155
03:32:07,900 --> 03:32:08,760
I'm trying.

3156
03:32:08,940 --> 03:32:09,940
Like, yeah, there's...

3157
03:32:09,940 --> 03:32:10,180
Yeah.

3158
03:32:12,440 --> 03:32:13,400
Yeah, um...

3159
03:32:13,400 --> 03:32:14,140
Um...

3160
03:32:16,960 --> 03:32:18,660
I'm not out healing that.

3161
03:32:19,840 --> 03:32:20,540
Uh...

3162
03:32:20,540 --> 03:32:23,120
Yeah, no, there's...

3163
03:32:23,120 --> 03:32:24,180
There's no out...

3164
03:32:25,280 --> 03:32:27,300
There's no out heals for that.

3165
03:32:27,920 --> 03:32:31,040
You have to use Invis to out heal it.

3166
03:32:31,780 --> 03:32:33,740
There was no outplay ability.

3167
03:32:37,550 --> 03:32:39,330
I mean, we stalled it.

3168
03:32:40,170 --> 03:32:41,190
I used it to stall.

3169
03:32:43,630 --> 03:32:47,670
Yeah, like, he was not living through an Invis Punisher.

3170
03:32:48,350 --> 03:32:50,010
It's literally...

3171
03:32:51,110 --> 03:32:53,710
The only way is literally just Invis.

3172
03:32:54,130 --> 03:32:56,130
My ult doesn't clear that.

3173
03:32:57,670 --> 03:32:59,430
My ult cannot heal that.

3174
03:33:00,390 --> 03:33:01,950
Which is unfortunate.

3175
03:33:04,170 --> 03:33:05,230
Oh shit, nice.

3176
03:33:06,770 --> 03:33:07,890
He has up.

3177
03:33:08,810 --> 03:33:10,370
He's looking for it.

3178
03:33:11,610 --> 03:33:13,350
Oh, there it is.

3179
03:33:14,390 --> 03:33:15,270
There it is.

3180
03:33:15,630 --> 03:33:17,550
Oh shit, there it is.

3181
03:33:17,570 --> 03:33:19,370
How is he in there?

3182
03:33:21,210 --> 03:33:46,560
oh wait how how how was he in this in there I'm actually so confused I don't know how he got there I was like what the fuck who's over there like who is that what the fuck was that

3183
03:33:49,750 --> 03:33:52,750
I got this

3184
03:34:02,190 --> 03:34:09,730
lucky all right does that hit anything like what does that hit

3185
03:34:13,110 --> 03:34:27,910
oh my god oh my god i'm i'm doing my best to keep you up i'm doing my best but this is where we die too this is actually where we die This is actually where we die

3186
03:34:36,090 --> 03:34:41,970
Yeah, very real Barely felt like we had an Iron Man.

3187
03:34:42,850 --> 03:34:43,470
That's all I'm saying.

3188
03:34:43,670 --> 03:34:50,770
I'm saying if we're gonna play Iron Man Just play ultra Then my court I was too close.

3189
03:34:51,270 --> 03:34:54,030
They were like you had you had it too good for too long

3190
03:35:00,140 --> 03:35:00,700
Yeah.

3191
03:35:02,780 --> 03:35:04,820
Yeah, why don't you just play the better Iron Man?

3192
03:35:08,180 --> 03:35:08,740
Alright.

3193
03:35:09,540 --> 03:35:12,820
Let us avoid the Iron Man.

3194
03:35:13,540 --> 03:35:13,980
Huh?

3195
03:35:17,420 --> 03:35:18,380
I don't know what I'm streaming for.

3196
03:35:19,140 --> 03:35:20,080
Oh my god.

3197
03:35:20,380 --> 03:35:20,620
Okay.

3198
03:35:20,860 --> 03:35:23,380
Either hit GM too, or I hit 4 hours.

3199
03:35:23,920 --> 03:35:24,580
I'm done.

3200
03:35:25,760 --> 03:35:26,780
I'm EP now.

3201
03:35:27,480 --> 03:35:28,860
I mean, I was EP when I started.

3202
03:35:34,400 --> 03:35:35,780
Yeah, it's only two games.

3203
03:35:35,980 --> 03:35:37,000
Then it'll be three games.

3204
03:35:37,200 --> 03:35:38,780
Then four games, guys.

3205
03:35:38,980 --> 03:35:40,160
When will it stop?

3206
03:35:46,580 --> 03:35:47,380
That's crazy.

3207
03:35:47,520 --> 03:35:51,720
I've been the only Venom in all these Doom matches.

3208
03:35:52,220 --> 03:35:53,820
What happened to our society?

3209
03:35:54,400 --> 03:35:57,920
I don't want to live in a society when I'm the only twerking Venom.

3210
03:36:00,160 --> 03:36:01,320
What's the point?

3211
03:36:07,340 --> 03:36:09,100
Wait, what's the point?

3212
03:36:10,780 --> 03:36:11,260

3213
03:36:11,740 --> 03:37:09,160

I heard it's someone's special birthday.

3215
03:37:13,440 --> 03:37:15,360
I heard, am I mad?

3216
03:37:15,680 --> 03:37:19,080
Come on, I heard it's someone's special birthday.

3217
03:37:28,220 --> 03:37:28,920
Toki.

3218
03:37:30,940 --> 03:37:33,160
Damn, she's laughing for real.

3219
03:37:34,960 --> 03:37:37,120
That's right, happy birthday, sir.

3220
03:37:38,460 --> 03:37:40,340
Oh wait, you know what I'm gonna do?

3221
03:37:40,500 --> 03:37:40,560
What?

3222
03:37:46,900 --> 03:37:49,880
This is why I've been waiting for this entire day.

3223
03:38:02,430 --> 03:38:03,630
That's harassment.

3224
03:38:04,650 --> 03:38:07,650
Finally, I found someone using that emote.

3225
03:38:08,070 --> 03:38:10,490
I've been waiting my whole life for that emote.

3226
03:38:12,570 --> 03:38:16,230
The last thing he saw before I got snapped out of existence.

3227
03:38:16,650 --> 03:38:24,710
This is the last thing he sees not the type who fades quietly into the background now Who am I gonna banish from this match?

3228
03:38:27,770 --> 03:38:39,450
I'm a menace that's right instead of finding pictures of spider-man you should have caught me I'm the true menace here

3229
03:38:48,730 --> 03:38:52,650
Think oh my god, we're not winning this our only tank is on Thor

3230
03:38:55,850 --> 03:39:01,090
I have like very low hopes on this lobby

3231
03:39:09,880 --> 03:39:19,710
GG's and pizza I don't know pizza pizza usually don't play tank unless he decides to be quirky today

3232
03:39:26,300 --> 03:39:33,720
all right I'm not playing Luna Luna Mantis or I'm not doing that

3233
03:39:38,430 --> 03:39:43,030
hey guys Don't worry, I've got you, guys.

3234
03:39:45,670 --> 03:39:46,950
Don't worry.

3235
03:39:49,610 --> 03:39:51,290
We got this, guys.

3236
03:39:52,350 --> 03:39:54,510
I'm here, the solo support.

3237
03:39:55,450 --> 03:39:56,130
Extraordinary.

3238
03:39:57,210 --> 03:39:58,570
On defense.

3239
03:40:01,830 --> 03:40:03,750
Okay, we're not...

3240
03:40:03,750 --> 03:40:04,590
Okay, that's fine.

3241
03:40:04,850 --> 03:40:05,890
We'll just grab your armor.

3242
03:40:06,090 --> 03:40:06,990
Grab your armor first.

3243
03:40:07,510 --> 03:40:08,230
Sport key.

3244
03:40:08,350 --> 03:40:09,850
Can you play tank or support?

3245
03:40:10,190 --> 03:40:34,130
completely other room all right grab your army actually we can grow we can go actually rocket rocket cloak actually works rocket tank actually works i'm not rocket cloak we got too many tanks three What do you mean too many tanks?

3246
03:40:34,490 --> 03:40:36,230
We have one tank.

3247
03:40:36,750 --> 03:40:39,030
When did one became too many?

3248
03:40:40,370 --> 03:40:41,130
When...

3249
03:40:41,130 --> 03:40:44,170
What do you mean?

3250
03:40:44,650 --> 03:40:45,810
That's one...

3251
03:40:45,810 --> 03:40:46,170
I'm sorry.

3252
03:40:46,370 --> 03:40:48,090
Did we all forget how to count?

3253
03:40:49,610 --> 03:40:51,130
It's that...

3254
03:40:51,130 --> 03:40:53,710
Did we all forget how to count, guys?

3255
03:40:54,090 --> 03:40:56,810
That is one too many dookies.

3256
03:40:57,950 --> 03:40:58,250
Silly.

3257
03:41:00,410 --> 03:41:01,930
No, apparently...

3258
03:41:01,930 --> 03:41:02,650
Rocket...

3259
03:41:02,670 --> 03:41:04,630
Your defense on this is really...

3260
03:41:04,630 --> 03:41:07,630
Rocket and Cloak for this is really good.

3261
03:41:07,650 --> 03:41:08,170
One more minute.

3262
03:41:10,370 --> 03:41:12,050
I have to take that away.

3263
03:41:12,730 --> 03:41:13,310
That's unlucky.

3264
03:41:13,630 --> 03:41:14,910
Let's hope nobody dies.

3265
03:41:15,370 --> 03:41:17,410
I don't have Wes.

3266
03:41:21,750 --> 03:41:22,670
Oh, that's unlucky.

3267
03:41:23,070 --> 03:41:23,970
I don't have Wes.

3268
03:41:25,130 --> 03:41:26,030
Oh, that's unlucky.

3269
03:41:26,450 --> 03:41:27,470
I don't have Wes.

3270
03:41:29,510 --> 03:41:30,610
That's unlucky.

3271
03:41:30,810 --> 03:41:32,150
I still don't have Ress.

3272
03:41:32,450 --> 03:41:32,650
Ow.

3273
03:41:32,670 --> 03:41:35,750
Oh, that's unlucky.

3274
03:41:36,690 --> 03:41:38,870
Oh, they just walked up to me.

3275
03:41:39,850 --> 03:41:40,190
All right.

3276
03:41:40,330 --> 03:41:41,490
I kept pushing forward.

3277
03:41:42,890 --> 03:41:43,930
Time for Invis.

3278
03:41:44,290 --> 03:41:45,110
Because I'm wolf.

3279
03:41:49,490 --> 03:41:51,870
I was gonna play Invis anyway.

3280
03:41:55,710 --> 03:41:59,090
I mean, I'm still gonna get fucking work my wolf.

3281
03:42:01,890 --> 03:42:02,410
Oh.

3282
03:42:02,670 --> 03:42:04,670
Let's hope that this works

3283
03:42:10,550 --> 03:42:11,870
All right

3284
03:42:18,760 --> 03:42:19,840
That's fine.

3285
03:42:19,960 --> 03:42:20,820
I got you.

3286
03:42:21,640 --> 03:42:28,160
Okay, not that though I'm trying I'm trying

3287
03:42:32,340 --> 03:42:35,860
Okay, they're also running solo Alright.

3288
03:42:38,220 --> 03:42:39,160
Okay.

3289
03:42:41,480 --> 03:42:42,380
That would be cool.

3290
03:42:43,460 --> 03:42:44,660
That's nice.

3291
03:42:44,920 --> 03:42:46,000
They're also...

3292
03:42:46,000 --> 03:42:46,100
Oh.

3293
03:42:47,040 --> 03:42:47,950
That's unlucky.

3294
03:42:52,860 --> 03:42:53,380
That's unlucky.

3295
03:42:55,320 --> 03:42:57,160
I have to use that so I can live.

3296
03:43:03,210 --> 03:43:06,930
Jesus Christ okay I have to use that so I can live

3297
03:43:11,210 --> 03:43:25,810
Oh he bubbled it that's unlucky I have to use it Where did he go where did he go

3298
03:43:29,490 --> 03:43:32,170
He jumps so high, I don't even know.

3299
03:43:32,670 --> 03:43:33,730
Where did he go?

3300
03:43:34,350 --> 03:43:39,370
I was like, he like, he like did a fucking magic trick or some shit.

3301
03:43:40,010 --> 03:43:41,350
Like, what the fuck?

3302
03:43:43,270 --> 03:43:45,990
He actually disappeared in my own ult.

3303
03:43:46,410 --> 03:43:47,550
In my ult.

3304
03:43:47,910 --> 03:43:49,810
How do you disappear in my ult?

3305
03:43:54,470 --> 03:43:55,670
That's crazy.

3306
03:44:02,730 --> 03:44:03,870
At least our authority.

3307
03:44:03,930 --> 03:44:57,890

3309
03:45:14,470 --> 03:45:15,150

03:45:20,750 --> 03:45:24,210

3311
03:45:24,970 --> 03:45:27,090
I had, that was a little embarrassing.

3312
03:45:29,910 --> 03:45:31,090
We all saw.

3313
03:45:32,050 --> 03:45:33,870
We all saw.

3314
03:45:36,250 --> 03:45:37,730
I don't have a triple right now.

3315
03:45:38,150 --> 03:45:38,730
I'm at 50.

3316
03:45:41,110 --> 03:45:41,710
They're taking damage.

3317
03:45:41,910 --> 03:45:43,450
They're going triple tank?

3318
03:45:45,950 --> 03:45:46,910
Fucking nerds.

3319
03:45:47,110 --> 03:45:48,150
I'm at 70 here.

3320
03:45:49,470 --> 03:45:50,810
Back up, back up, web, nothing and all that.

3321
03:45:51,010 --> 03:45:51,710
Yeah, back, back, back, back.

3322
03:45:51,730 --> 03:45:52,770
I don't have anything.

3323
03:45:58,210 --> 03:45:58,610
All right.

3324
03:45:59,530 --> 03:46:00,270
That's unlucky.

3325
03:46:01,050 --> 03:46:01,630
We die.

3326
03:46:03,190 --> 03:46:04,230
I'll die here.

3327
03:46:05,450 --> 03:46:07,790
So a TP?

3328
03:46:08,290 --> 03:46:10,410
We have to TP you.

3329
03:46:10,490 --> 03:46:12,290
I don't know if he can.

3330
03:46:16,290 --> 03:46:20,690
There you go.

3331
03:46:20,690 --> 03:46:20,910
Oh.

3332
03:46:24,830 --> 03:46:25,170
Nice, nice.

3333
03:46:25,330 --> 03:46:26,290
He used it late.

3334
03:46:26,470 --> 03:46:27,270
Mag, mag, mag, mag, mag, mag.

3335
03:46:31,950 --> 03:46:35,430
Oh my god, this... We're not winning this fight, by the way.

3336
03:46:36,170 --> 03:46:36,650
We're...

3337
03:46:36,650 --> 03:46:37,430
Okay.

3338
03:46:38,530 --> 03:46:41,330
We're absolutely not winning this fight.

3339
03:46:44,570 --> 03:46:45,230
Holy shit!

3340
03:46:45,970 --> 03:46:47,350
Oh my god!

3341
03:46:52,990 --> 03:46:54,090
That's unlucky.

3342
03:46:54,910 --> 03:46:55,530
Hey guys!

3343
03:46:56,690 --> 03:47:00,990
I think it's time to play Storm.

3344
03:47:02,310 --> 03:47:02,510
Bye.

3345
03:47:03,550 --> 03:47:05,550
Angus, you need to cross me on the fake game.

3346
03:47:07,050 --> 03:47:08,190
What did he say?

3347
03:47:08,530 --> 03:47:09,450
I don't even know he said.

3348
03:47:15,290 --> 03:47:32,590
I waited in the fade What the fuck does he mean I stood there waiting for you And I'll fade How do I What do you mean like trust you I literally was with you They have Luna here We don't have any support Keep that in mind

3349
03:47:36,610 --> 03:48:14,890
How do I trust you more I already stood still the god of thunder i trusted you i trusted you you told me to trust you with the fade i trusted you he's not giving me office by the way i'm sure it's working he said trust you on the fade and this is why i don't trust god do i have to play luna i don't want to play luna like how my half dude god damn it

3350
03:48:30,750 --> 03:48:52,730
okay that's crazy i am ready to put on the show Alright.

3351
03:48:53,610 --> 03:48:55,990
I had to do that because I was scared.

3352
03:48:59,310 --> 03:49:00,510
I heard...

3353
03:49:05,830 --> 03:49:07,150
Oh my gosh.

3354
03:49:08,690 --> 03:49:10,270
I got hit!

3355
03:49:11,070 --> 03:49:11,570
Goodbye!

3356
03:49:15,110 --> 03:49:16,270
Oh my god, I hit.

3357
03:49:17,270 --> 03:49:17,570
Alright.

3358
03:49:18,070 --> 03:49:18,630
Do I have Bucky?

3359
03:49:18,890 --> 03:49:19,190
No.

3360
03:49:21,010 --> 03:49:21,890
It's surprising.

3361
03:49:22,010 --> 03:49:24,230
We don't do any of the triple tank counties.

3362
03:49:28,350 --> 03:49:28,950
Okay.

3363
03:49:33,290 --> 03:49:35,830
Oh my god, I can't do anything.

3364
03:49:36,530 --> 03:49:39,730
I thought someone else could be on the cart.

3365
03:49:41,910 --> 03:49:44,370
The thing is, Thor is...

3366
03:49:44,370 --> 03:49:45,390
Oh wait, he had to.

3367
03:49:45,690 --> 03:49:48,250
He had... we literally had no shield tanks.

3368
03:49:51,130 --> 03:49:53,410
We have zero shield tanks.

3369
03:49:55,730 --> 03:49:57,510
Fine, I'll play Luna.

3370
03:49:58,270 --> 03:49:58,770
Fine.

3371
03:49:59,730 --> 03:50:00,810
I'll play Luna.

3372
03:50:01,290 --> 03:50:02,410
I shine in darkness.

3373
03:50:05,090 --> 03:50:13,470
guess i guess i'll play luna really loki luna no he's not even meta i don't know he's just so weak

3374
03:50:22,900 --> 03:50:44,820
fine i'll do it i'll go to luna jail i knew it guys i knew it the moment i'm close the moment i'm close to the gm2 they give me all the terrorists the terrorists all show up Oh, spare me your heroic platitudes, brother.

3375
03:50:45,160 --> 03:50:46,300
It's always been that way.

3376
03:50:50,440 --> 03:50:54,720
Well, to be fair, the only DPS that's doing anything is Sporky Cat, to be fair.

3377
03:50:57,680 --> 03:50:59,580
I'll do it, but I'm not gonna be...

3378
03:50:59,580 --> 03:51:01,440
I just got really bored with Luna.

3379
03:51:02,100 --> 03:51:05,200
Because last season, it was literally Luna Loki every game.

3380
03:51:05,380 --> 03:51:07,720
Like, if you want to win, you have to play Luna Loki.

3381
03:51:09,360 --> 03:51:43,310
you could play so I of course I got bored because there was no variety it's legit you have to play if you don't you're actually throwing so I got like super bored with it hey can we kill that one spider-man there the spider girl hey he's over it okay I kill him It's okay.

3382
03:51:43,350 --> 03:51:45,150
I can do it.

3383
03:51:45,150 --> 03:51:47,070
But I can't.

3384
03:51:49,070 --> 03:51:50,110
The scooter.

3385
03:51:50,370 --> 03:51:51,530
Sorry, scooter woman.

3386
03:51:52,930 --> 03:51:53,610
My apologies.

3387
03:51:53,910 --> 03:51:54,970
I meant scooter woman.

3388
03:51:56,410 --> 03:52:01,610
I'm just... So like, you know, I'm just trying to enjoy the freedom, you know?

3389
03:52:01,970 --> 03:52:07,910
Of playing like all... Because this season, it's like the most flexibility I've ever seen for supports.

3390
03:52:10,350 --> 03:52:11,850
Because it's like literally support meta.

3391
03:52:13,070 --> 03:52:24,950
Doesn't mean it's the best, but because triple support is so boring, but like It's something, you know Can we push?

3392
03:52:25,170 --> 03:52:25,910
Can we push a bit?

3393
03:52:27,110 --> 03:52:27,690
I'm trying.

3394
03:52:27,930 --> 03:52:28,330
I'm sorry.

3395
03:52:28,490 --> 03:52:32,490
I'm very slow Mentally right in

3396
03:52:36,070 --> 03:53:00,910
And physically Luna can't really do much because I need like there a mana for him i'm gonna try and i'm gonna get luna all out all right actually maybe my brain my brain isn't working he wants the damage boost dragon on niche dragon on niche

3397
03:53:10,430 --> 03:53:13,290
stands down we definitely did not need that

3398
03:53:16,470 --> 03:53:22,090
hello get out of here We're in herdy.

3399
03:53:23,730 --> 03:53:24,170
Wow.

3400
03:53:24,550 --> 03:53:26,630
It is so hard to get me on her face, right?

3401
03:53:29,230 --> 03:53:30,350
But maybe...

3402
03:53:30,350 --> 03:53:31,490
Yes, it is.

3403
03:53:32,270 --> 03:53:33,290
Oh, yes.

3404
03:53:36,410 --> 03:53:36,970
That's...

3405
03:53:36,970 --> 03:53:38,030
I think that's karma.

3406
03:53:38,910 --> 03:53:41,490
That may or may not be karma right there.

3407
03:53:47,650 --> 03:53:48,210
That's...

3408
03:53:48,530 --> 03:53:49,090
to a karma.

3409
03:53:52,090 --> 03:53:52,890
Oh, there he is.

3410
03:53:53,810 --> 03:53:53,810
Cool.

3411
03:53:54,330 --> 03:53:55,150
Going on chaos.

3412
03:53:56,950 --> 03:53:57,130
Fuck.

3413
03:54:02,250 --> 03:54:03,990
This is not good.

3414
03:54:05,210 --> 03:54:07,110
I may be using everything there.

3415
03:54:08,750 --> 03:54:18,390
Okay, this is bad because, no, it's not nice because I froze the strange, which means he has 50% alt so he can still use it.

3416
03:54:18,530 --> 03:54:38,810
strange but got console so at 50 they use yeah he says it on 50 that's the thing that's why it's not good what the what the what the was that luna doing we're gonna have the force on oh what the okay that sucks

3417
03:54:42,290 --> 03:54:44,890
maces maybe win over but i don't know if you want to

3418
03:54:49,030 --> 03:54:50,570
Are we up to this then?

3419
03:54:51,550 --> 03:54:52,830
We get a pair out of this.

3420
03:54:53,050 --> 03:54:54,670
Alright, we have...

3421
03:54:56,930 --> 03:54:57,490
Heals.

3422
03:54:58,230 --> 03:54:59,190
He's gonna all...

3423
03:54:59,190 --> 03:55:00,210
He's gonna all...

3424
03:55:03,910 --> 03:55:05,090
Wait, who died?

3425
03:55:06,850 --> 03:55:08,410
I was like...

3426
03:55:08,410 --> 03:55:09,710
Who is it?

3427
03:55:10,570 --> 03:55:11,170
Who died?

3428
03:55:11,910 --> 03:55:12,390
Did he...

3429
03:55:12,390 --> 03:55:14,210
Oh my god, he got solo a bit.

3430
03:55:14,830 --> 03:55:15,630
That's unfortunate.

3431
03:55:18,530 --> 03:55:20,150
I was so confused.

3432
03:55:20,370 --> 03:55:21,390
I was like, who was that?

3433
03:55:24,350 --> 03:55:25,290
Phoenix, Phoenix, Phoenix.

3434
03:55:27,110 --> 03:55:28,270
There you go.

3435
03:55:28,830 --> 03:55:29,710
Oh, Phoenix, right?

3436
03:55:32,270 --> 03:55:33,110
Wait, what?

3437
03:55:33,350 --> 03:55:33,810
Where's the Phoenix?

3438
03:55:37,210 --> 03:55:38,110
Where's the Phoenix?

3439
03:55:38,930 --> 03:55:40,090
Oh my god, I'm scared.

3440
03:55:40,710 --> 03:55:41,950
Phoenix is still behind, by the way.

3441
03:55:41,970 --> 03:55:43,070
I don't know where she is.

3442
03:55:43,830 --> 03:55:45,550
She's right behind me, isn't she?

3443
03:55:46,990 --> 03:55:48,190
I'm so scared.

3444
03:55:53,450 --> 03:55:54,050
What?

3445
03:55:58,210 --> 03:55:59,710
Where is she?

3446
03:56:01,470 --> 03:56:01,970
Oh, no.

3447
03:56:03,130 --> 03:56:03,810
Oh, no.

3448
03:56:04,910 --> 03:56:05,990
Hey, there she is.

3449
03:56:06,310 --> 03:56:08,250
Oh, that's unlucky.

3450
03:56:08,530 --> 03:56:09,370
That was a little too slow.

3451
03:56:10,070 --> 03:56:11,210
Oh, that's not good.

3452
03:56:13,410 --> 03:56:14,310
That's not good.

3453
03:56:15,470 --> 03:56:16,550
That's not good.

3454
03:56:16,750 --> 03:56:17,910
We're getting pummeled.

3455
03:56:18,530 --> 03:56:20,910
the other support are getting pummeled in the back.

3456
03:56:22,070 --> 03:56:22,770
Like, look at this.

3457
03:56:22,970 --> 03:56:23,670
Look, look at us.

3458
03:56:23,970 --> 03:56:24,990
That's three takes.

3459
03:56:25,350 --> 03:56:26,630
That's all three takes.

3460
03:56:28,150 --> 03:56:31,330
That's all three takes just beating us up.

3461
03:56:32,010 --> 03:56:33,790
I was like, I don't like that.

3462
03:56:34,470 --> 03:56:36,250
That was not fun.

3463
03:56:44,010 --> 03:56:45,130
It's just us.

3464
03:56:45,230 --> 03:56:49,070
It's like, don't come to this street neighbor again.

3465
03:56:53,570 --> 03:56:55,090
What the fuck?

3466
03:57:01,430 --> 03:57:01,990
Jesus Christ.

3467
03:57:02,390 --> 03:57:12,570
Oh my god, I have love, but everyone's seeing so much damage, man.

3468
03:57:17,340 --> 03:57:18,800
Holy shit, we find...

3469
03:57:21,420 --> 03:57:21,700

3471
03:57:27,480 --> 03:57:28,240

3474
03:58:04,150 --> 03:58:04,690

3475
03:58:04,850 --> 03:58:05,230
Where?

3476
03:58:05,390 --> 03:58:05,590

3477
03:58:09,640 --> 03:58:15,200

3478
03:58:17,380 --> 03:58:22,360
Oh my god, Hulk, please Hulk, please

03:58:30,210 --> 03:58:32,250
Okay, we do not okay.

3480
03:58:32,330 --> 03:58:33,150
We don't kill him.

3481
03:58:33,770 --> 03:58:37,850
That's fine Is that true?

3482
03:58:44,380 --> 03:58:50,240
Okay, guys, I don't think this is winnable no more.

3483
03:58:50,580 --> 03:59:10,520
I want to believe I really do want to believe.

3484
03:59:19,360 --> 03:59:23,380
I had a feeling it was over

3485
03:59:30,600 --> 03:59:52,000
my bad for the attitude yeah we just they just somehow went from one tank player to three why the fuck did that guy never swapped the tank why did he play iron man wait a minute this guy couldn't play tank this entire time.

3486
03:59:52,340 --> 03:59:54,160
He was the Iron Man player.

3487
03:59:54,640 --> 03:59:55,680
This fucker.

3488
03:59:56,000 --> 03:59:58,230
This actual fucker.

3489
04:00:00,480 --> 04:00:02,300
He is a menace.

3490
04:00:03,380 --> 04:00:05,140
Someone get him out of here.

3491
04:00:05,540 --> 04:00:05,700
Alright.

3492
04:00:06,340 --> 04:00:06,620
Okay.

3493
04:00:07,460 --> 04:00:09,520
If we lose the next game, I'm still out.

3494
04:00:09,660 --> 04:00:11,060
Because it's the four hour mark.

3495
04:00:13,360 --> 04:00:14,380
This is...

3496
04:00:14,380 --> 04:00:16,540
Next game is my LG.

3497
04:00:18,020 --> 04:00:19,600
No matter win loss.

3498
04:00:22,600 --> 04:00:24,040
This is my LG.

3499
04:00:24,560 --> 04:00:25,660
No matter what.

3500
04:00:26,300 --> 04:00:28,260
What the fuck is Ryan, man?

3501
04:00:29,580 --> 04:00:31,020
I'm so people on my list.

3502
04:00:31,340 --> 04:00:33,480
Everybody changed their names all the time.

3503
04:00:35,160 --> 04:00:36,380
Who's Ryan, man?

3504
04:00:39,300 --> 04:00:41,780
Oh, that's Super Gomez's alt account.

3505
04:00:42,100 --> 04:00:42,820
Oh, okay.

3506
04:00:43,260 --> 04:00:43,580
Yeah.

3507
04:00:46,140 --> 04:00:49,080
I know he's, like, trio stacking with TTK.

3508
04:00:51,380 --> 04:00:53,500
Because I was like, who the fuck is that guy?

3509
04:00:55,200 --> 04:00:56,200
Today is my off.

3510
04:00:56,280 --> 04:00:57,400
Today is my off day.

3511
04:01:01,140 --> 04:01:02,940
Today is my off day.

3512
04:01:03,180 --> 04:01:04,960
I get to the side when I stop.

3513
04:01:05,240 --> 04:01:06,800
This is literally doing overtime.

3514
04:01:07,420 --> 04:01:09,260
This is literally my overtime day.

3515
04:01:13,930 --> 04:01:15,770
I'm literally doing overtime.

3516
04:01:17,050 --> 04:01:20,090
And all I get are like, Ilo Terrace.

3517
04:01:22,650 --> 04:01:24,960
That's my reward for it.

3518
04:01:32,690 --> 04:01:33,990
And what the fuck did we get?

3519
04:01:34,250 --> 04:01:34,990
Oh, this is...

3520
04:01:34,990 --> 04:01:35,790
What did we get?

3521
04:01:36,730 --> 04:01:39,110
We have two players on our team that's top 500.

3522
04:01:39,270 --> 04:01:40,850
Two players on the enemy team that's top 500.

3523
04:01:47,650 --> 04:01:50,430
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

3524
04:01:50,670 --> 04:01:50,890
Maybe good?

3525
04:01:51,130 --> 04:01:51,690
I don't know.

3526
04:01:52,870 --> 04:01:53,330
Alright.

3527
04:01:53,950 --> 04:01:55,390
I banned Emma.

3528
04:01:58,130 --> 04:01:59,650
in case they do torch first ban

3529
04:02:06,100 --> 04:02:09,880
you're right I should have stopped while I'm ahead you're so right guys

3530
04:02:14,150 --> 04:02:33,330
alright while they're doing oh nice they banned torch for me that's good oh but do we have any Phoenix players no right I'm banning Phoenix then yeah I'm not dealing with Phoenix I just had a Phoenix last game I'm done already

3531
04:02:38,550 --> 04:02:40,510
Daisy, thank you for the tier one sub.

3532
04:02:40,770 --> 04:02:40,990
Thank you.

3533
04:02:41,150 --> 04:02:41,430
Thank you.

3534
04:02:52,100 --> 04:02:52,640
All right.

3535
04:02:53,140 --> 04:02:54,100
What map is this?

3536
04:02:54,260 --> 04:02:54,960
Hell is Haven?

3537
04:02:58,650 --> 04:02:59,670
I'll go, Cloak.

3538
04:03:00,130 --> 04:03:01,590
We are Cloak and Dagger.

3539
04:03:02,510 --> 04:03:03,930
We are hope and fear.

3540
04:03:05,830 --> 04:03:06,570
All right, Luna.

3541
04:03:07,010 --> 04:03:08,510
I'm allowed to play Cloak.

3542
04:03:10,010 --> 04:03:11,450
Last game I played, Luna.

3543
04:03:11,890 --> 04:03:13,310
This is my no aim game.

3544
04:03:17,630 --> 04:03:18,190
Okay.

3545
04:03:18,210 --> 04:03:19,130
I don't like any of the...

3546
04:03:19,130 --> 04:03:21,970
I think the only cloak skin I like is the Battle Pass one.

3547
04:03:23,390 --> 04:03:24,470
The one where she's like...

3548
04:03:24,470 --> 04:03:25,710
I don't like that one either.

3549
04:03:28,210 --> 04:03:29,090
Honestly, like...

3550
04:03:29,090 --> 04:03:30,050
Oh, I didn't...

3551
04:03:30,050 --> 04:03:31,310
I don't like the Phoenix.

3552
04:03:31,350 --> 04:03:32,530
There's a Phoenix one.

3553
04:03:33,230 --> 04:03:36,130
I actually like the Phoenix skin for it.

3554
04:03:36,210 --> 04:03:37,090
Only because...

3555
04:03:37,090 --> 04:03:38,610
I hate the skin.

3556
04:03:39,050 --> 04:03:40,470
But I like the sound effects.

3557
04:03:40,710 --> 04:03:41,470
Because it does...

3558
04:03:41,470 --> 04:03:43,570
It makes the sound effect when this hits people.

3559
04:03:43,710 --> 04:03:45,170
So I know if I hit someone.

3560
04:03:51,610 --> 04:03:55,190
Like, the Phoenix one lets me know if I healed someone with my E.

3561
04:03:56,210 --> 04:03:58,250
Like, it makes a bling sound.

3562
04:04:02,650 --> 04:04:04,090
But this one doesn't.

3563
04:04:04,550 --> 04:04:06,110
This one, like, is just, like, guess.

3564
04:04:07,650 --> 04:04:08,830
Figure it out yourself.

3565
04:04:09,870 --> 04:04:10,710
Oh, running trip?

3566
04:04:10,930 --> 04:04:12,630
Okay, we're gonna run trip.

3567
04:04:12,850 --> 04:04:14,190
Fuck, I should play Duna then.

3568
04:04:15,550 --> 04:04:16,810
Are we running trip?

3569
04:04:18,610 --> 04:04:20,270
Are they also running trip?

3570
04:04:26,250 --> 04:04:27,370
Oh, Nishias!

3571
04:04:28,530 --> 04:04:30,930
I don't want to use my right click yet.

3572
04:04:31,150 --> 04:04:32,210
I'll use it here, actually.

3573
04:04:36,700 --> 04:04:37,560
Just use it here.

3574
04:04:38,180 --> 04:04:39,380
Oh, don't worry, Jeff.

3575
04:04:39,660 --> 04:04:40,300
I got you.

3576
04:04:40,940 --> 04:04:42,840
Don't worry, I got you.

3577
04:04:44,160 --> 04:04:44,520
Don't worry.

3578
04:04:44,560 --> 04:04:46,420
Oh, that's very unlucky.

3579
04:04:48,720 --> 04:04:49,900
That's very unlucky.

3580
04:04:49,920 --> 04:05:50,580
only because like we have one tank they have two not great for us because i have a feeling what's gonna happen i knew it guys remember i was like we came so far and then they're just gonna take it away they have two tanks we have one it truly is sad because triple support only works oh my god have ultron as the other triple support only works if you also have uh oh my god you're crazy i i couldn't fade i couldn't fade in time goodbye everybody no i was on cloak i was on cloak i mean i was on dagger and not cloak that's so sad my time to shine lights out i'm sad i was on the wrong wrong one.

3581
04:05:52,720 --> 04:05:53,940
Okay, she has to do it.

3582
04:05:59,160 --> 04:05:59,300
There.

3583
04:06:00,080 --> 04:06:00,600
Oh.

3584
04:06:01,180 --> 04:06:02,060
Hello, I'm here.

3585
04:06:02,540 --> 04:06:02,760
Hello.

3586
04:06:04,140 --> 04:06:04,740
Thank you.

3587
04:06:08,380 --> 04:06:10,120
I'm a little scared.

3588
04:06:12,560 --> 04:06:13,340
Oh my god.

3589
04:06:13,460 --> 04:06:13,940
Are they alive?

3590
04:06:14,080 --> 04:06:14,340
They are.

3591
04:06:14,480 --> 04:06:14,640
Okay.

3592
04:06:17,280 --> 04:06:17,800
Alright.

3593
04:06:21,000 --> 04:06:21,980
That's good.

3594
04:06:22,960 --> 04:06:23,680
Thank God we have.

3595
04:06:24,840 --> 04:06:26,880
Thank God we have that up.

3596
04:06:27,520 --> 04:06:30,240
Wait, I feel like there's a...

3597
04:06:30,240 --> 04:06:31,520
Something doesn't feel right here.

3598
04:06:31,860 --> 04:06:34,920
Yeah, could someone else go check that over there real quick?

3599
04:06:36,820 --> 04:06:38,920

04:06:40,440 --> 04:06:41,700

3604
04:07:31,540 --> 04:07:33,980
I don't think like that's what he wanted to do.

3605
04:07:37,320 --> 04:07:37,800
This.

3606
04:07:39,340 --> 04:07:40,780
