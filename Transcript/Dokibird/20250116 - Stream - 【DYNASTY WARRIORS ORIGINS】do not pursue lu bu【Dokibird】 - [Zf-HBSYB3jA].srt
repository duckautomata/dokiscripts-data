1
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,110
Oh shit, sorry.

2
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,870
That's all the different stuff.

3
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,350
Whoa, sorry.

4
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,170
Ha ha ha!

5
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,250
Sorry, how many loops have we been?

6
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,350
I lost track.

7
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,170
How many loops has it been, guys?

8
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,150
I literally just got back.

9
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,030
I had to, like, move my laundry stuff and put in new laundry things.

10
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,250
Oh my god, I'm a little bit of a mess right now.

11
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,230
Um, alright!

12
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,370
So, as we all know, we're not starting right away because we have a story time!

13
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,050
Woo!

14
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,910
Story time!

15
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,270
Let me grab chat.

16
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,810
I rushed home.

17
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,750
Um, okay, so, like, I have several stories.

18
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,010
Several, several stories.

19
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:14,690
But I'll start off with, like, I'll start off with a story that, like, some of you guys are gonna be like, Oh, Doki again.

20
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,170
Again, about this Marvel Rivals.

21
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,530
Doki, please get... Okay, look.

22
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,390
Um, alright, so!

23
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,730
Update regarding Marvel Rivals on Twitch.

24
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,690
Um, I will...

25
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,850
The only times after yesterday...

26
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:45,990
Okay, so for those who, like, didn't watch yesterday's Twitch stream, yesterday's Twitch stream where I streamed Marvel Rivals on Twitch, apparently after the third or fourth game, you know how I was winning a lot?

27
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:51,290
And then after, like, third or fourth game, like, um, things got a little bad.

28
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,450
As in, we basically...

29
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:59,350
I got confirmation from Gomez that I was basically, like, sniped every game.

30
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:06,730
LOL lol lol So, um...

31
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:22,910
So, yeah, so, from now on, if I'm streaming at, like, late-night queues, I will be force stacking at late-night queues or, yeah, force stacking at late-night queues because I was like, I can't deal with that.

32
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:33,590
But, um, if I'm streaming it on Twitch at normal hours, like, you know, peak hours, I will be, um, I will be like, I can solo, I can solo duo.

33
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,250
It's just that late night is a little, is a lot rougher now.

34
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:47,430
And then, my manager, I was telling my manager about this, and they were like, congratulations, now you know how every popular streamer felt, feels when they're streaming on Twitch.

35
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,790
Congratulations Doki, you're popular now!

36
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:58,030
I was like, but I, I, but I don't want to be streamster!

37
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,020
They were like, that's what every streamer has to go through.

38
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,720
You made it, Doki!

39
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:13,580
And I'm like, but I didn't, but on YouTube it doesn't happen to me!

40
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:27,060
They're like, the manager's just like, you do know, every streamer at your level and more, has, goes through this every fucking day.

41
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,140
You do know that.

42
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,260
I was like, but they don't know I exist on YouTube, so I never had to deal with it.

43
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,020
I, I never had to deal with it.

44
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,020
Even when I got stream sniped at Apex, they were all dog shit!

45
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,440
Why, why do the real gamers exist on Twitch?

46
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,180
Bitch!

47
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,220
All my YouTube snipers are so nice to me!

48
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,060
My YouTube snipers are so nice to me!

49
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,360
My Twitch snipers are mean!

50
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,700
At least they were funny!

51
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,040
At least my YouTube snipers were funny!

52
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:26,640
Um, um, yeah, so, uh, so, basically, I know, I'm just not used to it.

53
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,840
I'm so not used to being stream sniped on it, like, to this degree.

54
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:45,540
But, like, everybody on Twitch basically gets stream, like, especially they're, like, in competitive shooting, and in competitive shooting, or, like, just competitive games in general, um, this happens to them, like, almost every stream.

55
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,300
And I'm just, like, I'm just, like, oh my god, I'm not used to it.

56
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,020
I, I don't, I, I'm just not used to it.

57
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,020
I have to, I have to get used to it, but it's, it's so new!

58
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,680
It's, it's so new to me!

59
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,340
Um, anyway, so, here's a funny story about one, remember the Groot guy?

60
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:27,680
Okay, for those who, okay, for context-wise, for those who didn't watch the Twitch stream yesterday, um, um, we had a stream sniper, um, and he was on Groot, and he was basically throwing, like, he wasn't, like, throwing, but he was, like, bad at being a Groot one trick,

61
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,920
because he couldn't, we were, like, but I didn't say anything about him.

62
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,460
I was just shit-talking the low-key player, because I was, like, what are you doing?

63
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,160
I was, like, why isn't he ulting?

64
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,060
Why did he let me?

65
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:52,740
I was just, I was shit-talking the low-key player, and then it was only at the end was I was, like, oh yeah, he didn't do any ult combo, like, he, like, the other Groot was clearly better than our Groot, so he got Groot dipped, and then, apparently, he was hate-watching that.

66
00:10:52,920 --> 00:11:07,380
He was watching my stream, and, like, just, like, watching to see my reaction, uh, my reaction to his gameplay, and, like, he thought I was shit-talking him, and I was just, like, I'm, like, what the fuck?

67
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:23,980
I wasn't, I was, like, I wasn't, and then he, like, blamed him, and, okay, so, context-wise, okay, and then he stream sniped me on the second, and got me again on the second game, and I was watching my stream and reacting to it, and was, like, shit-talking me on,

68
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,520
in, like, in, like, responding to, like, what I was saying on stream, because I don't talk to people.

69
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,280
I keep it in my stream.

70
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:46,500
I don't say it to the VC, so, like, um, and then, like, he, right after that game, he friended Gomez to talk more shit about me, like, what kind of?

71
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,020
And then, I was, like, what the fuck was he saying?

72
00:11:52,300 --> 00:12:02,200
And you know what he, the, okay, all right, so, he literally was telling him, he was, like, why doesn't she try on stream?

73
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,480
Why is she focused on entertaining her chat and not trying on stream?

74
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,520
And I was, like, excuse me?

75
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,620
The first game wasn't even my fault.

76
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,420
I was trying so hard on my first game, the first game.

77
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,140
I wasn't even the problem in the, he was the problem in the first game.

78
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:33,640
And I was just, like, I didn't lose as that first game.

79
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,980
The second game, I got tilted, but it wasn't because I was, like, not trying.

80
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,920
I actually got tilted on the second game.

81
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:54,240
And, like, but then he was, like, um, he was just, like, yelling at Gomez and was, like, I can't believe, like, why doesn't she try?

82
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:03,460
And I'm, like, bro, even when I'm streaming, I'm still playing better than you.

83
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,960
Oh my god, I was so surprised.

84
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,940
I was just, like, anyway, um, he got reported for stream sniping because apparently it is a bannable offense.

85
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:24,920
So, like, I don't know if he will get banned, but, like, it was nice that, uh, Gomez reported him to the devs right after.

86
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:32,560
Um, but, like, I thought that shit was so funny.

87
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,740
I was, like, what?

88
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,720
I was just, like, what are you?

89
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,680
What do you mean?

90
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,140
Why?

91
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,120
Why is she so focused on being an entertainer?

92
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,260
She should be trying, like, all these other pro players.

93
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,760
How dare she be a fucking content creator?

94
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,140
Like, oh my god.

95
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:59,840
So, um, um, so that's basically, like, what was going on yesterday.

96
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,120
Like, how dare you be?

97
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,140
Oh, I'm sorry for being entertaining.

98
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:12,100
Well, there's, like, 500 million other streamers out there streaming Marvel Rivals that are doing super try-hard shit.

99
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,180
Like, go watch them if you want.

100
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,420
I'm just trying to be actually entertaining.

101
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:23,340
Like, if you wanna, I've never tooted my own horn being, like, a pro or anything.

102
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,180
I literally, I literally hit my head against the wall until I figure out how to play the game.

103
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,440
Like, I don't know what the fuck I'm actually doing.

104
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,480
I just play the game.

105
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,640
Like, that shit, that was crazy.

106
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:47,800
That was such a, like, I think the craziest part is the fact that he friended my duo just to yell at me.

107
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,360
Like, just to yell.

108
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,860
He didn't even friend me.

109
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,720
He friended my duo.

110
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,400
I was like, wait, he friended you?

111
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,740
And that checked my friend list and I didn't even get an ad.

112
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,940
He friended my duo just to talk shit about me.

113
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,600
Yeah, that's so crazy.

114
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,900
I'm like, are you, like, 14?

115
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,760
Like, I'm gonna tell your dad about this.

116
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,880
I'm gonna tell a grown-up about you.

117
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,200
And I'm like, excuse me?

118
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,340
I'm gonna tell a teacher.

119
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,440
I can't fathom yelling at you.

120
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,960
Like, that's so crazy.

121
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:38,880
But yes, I was indeed getting stream sniped almost every game.

122
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:46,820
So, like, that's why I, like, knew I'm gonna try and force stack during late night queues and then during, like, actual decent hours.

123
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,400
And I'm playing Marvel Rivals on Twitch.

124
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:58,920
Then I'll, like, you know, actually, I won't be worried because it's harder to stream snipe me when everybody's fucking queuing at the same time.

125
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,240
So, like, that's basically it.

126
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,020
Okay, another story that I really want to tell you guys.

127
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:16,540
So, the reason why I was late was because I had, like, a lot of errands to do today.

128
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,800
One of the things is I had to go to the bank and I had to do some bank stuff.

129
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:40,800
And then, and the reason why I was so late coming back is because I need to find, I had to find a new bank because something happened at the bank where I realized I have to go to another bank now.

130
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:57,740
So, so, basically, all right, so, I'm okay telling this story because I think this person knows me from streaming on Twitch.

131
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,480
So, basically, I was, I was going, I went to the bank to do some stuff.

132
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,680
And, um, and then I was the bank teller.

133
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,180
I was the bank teller.

134
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,420
And I was like, oh, you know, and my bank, it has my business name.

135
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,160
You see, my account has my business name, right?

136
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:30,100
So, um, so, and then, like, she came back and was like, hey, one of my co-workers was asking if you knew, knew somebody called something wig.

137
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:37,100
And I was like, deer in the head.

138
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,610
And I didn't know what, at that time, I was like, what do I say?

139
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,870
I was like, oh, yeah, yeah, I do.

140
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,190
Because, like, I just didn't, I legit, I just didn't know.

141
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,830
But, like, I, it was so out of nowhere.

142
00:17:52,830 --> 00:18:01,070
So, I was just, and lying just didn't come, like, I just couldn't, I, I just, my brain just couldn't go with lying.

143
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,310
Because it was just, it just, I just didn't know.

144
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,450
I was just like, oh, my God.

145
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,050
If the, if she said, like, are you jokey breed?

146
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:15,550
Or, like, anything else, I would have been able to lie.

147
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,490
But then she was like, do you know this person called something wig?

148
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:28,770
And then I was just like, I just, because it was such a, it was a question I was not prepared for, at all.

149
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,850
Like, I was not prepared for that one.

150
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,510
So, if it was anything else, I would be prepared.

151
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,870
But this one, I wasn't.

152
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:46,130
Anyway, so, she didn't know what was going on, because, like, she was like, um, she was just like, oh, my, my co-worker, like, said that.

153
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,550
And then, like, after I was done with my bank stuff, because I was like, okay, it's fine.

154
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,030
The actual bank teller doesn't know who I'm at, who I am.

155
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,630
It's just a co-worker.

156
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,390
It's fine.

157
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,490
It's just a co-worker.

158
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:05,570
And then, and then, after I was done with my bank stuff, I was just, like, packing up my stuff.

159
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:13,590
And then, this, the guy, the co-worker, approached me and was like, are you Doki Bird?

160
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,270
And I was just like, no.

161
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,950
I just work for her.

162
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,410
I was like, no, I just, I just work for her.

163
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:37,090
And then, and then, and then, and then they were like, they were like, oh, oh, do you stream?

164
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,910
I was like, no.

165
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,950
She just doesn't like to go to the bank, so I do this for her.

166
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,470
Oh,

167
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,590
my God.

168
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,970
Oh, my God.

169
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:59,270
So, anyway, now, after that, I'm not going back to that bank.

170
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:04,330
I'm, I'm, I'm, I, I have moved to another bank now.

171
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:15,770
Like, I, I have, I, I have relocated to a different bank now, because I don't want to show my face at that bank anymore.

172
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:20,290
I don't, but it's, it's so far away.

173
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,150
And I could never go back.

174
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,950
It's, the other bank is so far away.

175
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:33,670
So, that's why I was late, because I waited a bit to tell this story, because I was like, I don't want to give them.

176
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:51,590
So, like, I have, yes, but I think they're a Twitch watcher, because they're like, do you know NiceWig, or do you know NiceWig, basically, because I'm pretty sure they're a Twitch watcher, and that's why I tell this story on YouTube, because sometimes the audiences don't overlap.

177
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,330
And that's the gamble I'm willing to take.

178
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,110
That's, that's the gamble I'm willing to take right now.

179
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,860
So, oh my god.

180
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:14,260
So, yeah, so I was just like, BankerBro, BankerBro totally not watching the stream, and it's totally not a drag.

181
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,980
JP, thank you for the super chat.

182
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
Thank you, thank you.

183
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:31,860
So, that's why I was a little late coming back, because, like I said, like, it's a lot further than my, than my old place, but, like, I got, I got scared after that.

184
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:40,840
I was just like, oh man, like, I don't know if I can show my face, but I don't, I don't know if he believed me.

185
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:51,900
That's the thing, because after I was like, no, I just work for her, and, like, she doesn't like to go to the bank herself, because she doesn't, she wants her privacy respected.

186
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,000
And, like, I don't think he believed me.

187
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:07,000
That's the worst part, because he was like, do you, because he asked me if I streamed after I was like, no, I'm not DokiBird, I just work for her.

188
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,420
And then he was like, do you stream, though?

189
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,840
And I'm like, oh, oh, fuck.

190
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,160
I don't know if he does.

191
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,340
I'll never, I'm not risking it, though.

192
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,940
I'm not risking it.

193
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,700
Oh my god, I was so monotone, too.

194
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,940
They were like, I was like, oh no, I just, I work for her.

195
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,240
I, I, uh, she doesn't like to go to the bank.

196
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,640
Like, I was so monotone, like...

197
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:52,080
I tried so hard to, like, not, like, just be a different, be fucking different.

198
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:03,620
Um, um, anyway, so that's another story, but not DokiBird is one of your most used tags.

199
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,400
How would they know?

200
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,180
I said I'm not DokiBird.

201
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,740
How would they know?

202
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,840
I fooled some people before I can do it again, but I don't think, I don't think I tricked, I don't, I don't know.

203
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,240
I think he knows.

204
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:24,460
I, I think, I think he knew the moment I said I wasn't DokiBird.

205
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,440
I think he knew.

206
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,980
Are you DokiBird?

207
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,740
No, I'm not DokiBird.

208
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,760
I ain't worried.

209
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,240
Thank you for the super chat.

210
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,740
Thank you, thank you.

211
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,520
Um, um, um, anyway, uh, anyway, so that's another story.

212
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:56,800
So, also, like, I went to get my eyebrows, uh, threaded today, because I haven't, um, I haven't, like, got my eyebrows threaded, like, done.

213
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:14,200
I, okay, I have a problem with hair, so, like, this only affects my eyebrows, like, my face and head, but I grow hair way too fast, and I grow a lot of hair, so, like, when I get my haircut done, every time, I have to get my haircut done very frequently,

214
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:27,620
or it gets super thick and super long within a couple of months, like, within, like, a few months, like, two to three months, I have to get my hair cut regularly, so, like, and then I don't have a unibrow.

215
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:43,360
I just get lots of, I just have a lot, like, it's, like, the volume is a lot, like, thick So, I have to get it, um, I haven't, like, done it recently, and so, like, I was, like, oh, fuck, there's, it's, I, there's too much.

216
00:24:43,620 --> 00:25:02,860
So, like, so, like, this happens for my face and head, so, I have, so, like, um, when I went to get my eyebrows threaded, um, the lady was, like, was, like, oh, my God, I love your eyebrows, there's so much volume, and inside my head, I was, like, that is the problem,

217
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,180
that is the fucking problem.

218
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,340
She's, like, oh, my God, I love working with your eyebrows, there's so much volume.

219
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,220
I'm, like, no, it's not good.

220
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:16,560
It's...

221
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:27,520
It's not good, there's too much, and too much hair.

222
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:45,220
And it's, like, so weird, the rest of my body doesn't have the effect, it's just my fucking face and head, and I'm, like, oh, and every time, every time I, like, finish my haircut, there's, like, a fucking pool of hair, like, if I do haircuts and stuff,

223
00:25:45,220 --> 00:26:03,520
and they'll be, like, wow, your hair is so thick, there's so much volume on your head, and I'm, like, yes, and my head feels so fucking heavy because of it, and then, um, and then they'll be, and then I look down, and it's just, like, it's just hair, it's... I just,

224
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:11,700
I look down, and it's just fucking hair, it's just a pool of hair, but I still have, like, but it feels like they cut nothing.

225
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,480
Don't keep me waiting for Guanyin.

226
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:24,000
It doesn't affect my, okay, it doesn't affect my, like, like, lips, upper lips, it's literally my eyebrows.

227
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:36,460
It's my eyebrows and, like, my hair, like, my upper lip is okay, thank God, like, I don't... Thank fucking God, I'm so happy I don't have to deal with that.

228
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:57,420
It's literally, it's, like, it's, like, my eyebrows, and I remember, like, um, I remember, like, when I was getting my... I was so self-conscious about my eyebrows because I have thick eyebrows, and then, like, back then, I didn't get, like, I didn't do,

229
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:09,600
like, thread... I didn't thread my eyebrows for, like, maintenance back then, but I was in, like, high school, so, like, I didn't care as much because I was in, like, I was in middle school, so I was in middle school, so, of course, I didn't care.

230
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:25,140
I was in fucking middle school, and then, like, I always... but I was always, like, like, semi-self-conscious about it because I just didn't, like, I just didn't like that my eyebrows were really thick, and so, um, so, like, I remember one of my friends who's,

231
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:36,420
like, an artist, and then she, like, she was doing, like, portraits and stuff, and then she was, like, um, she was, like, drawing me, and then she's, like, oh, I love drawing your eyebrows.

232
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,240
They're so thick.

233
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,680
I'm, like, please don't.

234
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:39,960
Please.

235
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,480
I'm so uncomfortable.

236
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,100
I'm, like, I'm very uncomfortable.

237
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,620
She's, like, oh, you have such nice thick eyebrows.

238
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,760
It's so nice to draw.

239
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,620
It's so unique to draw.

240
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:08,700
And I was, like, oh, my God, like, you know, maybe I don't want to be involved in this carcass, like, in this drawing anymore.

241
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,540
I don't want to be involved.

242
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,980
Um, Andy, thank you for the super chat.

243
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,380
Thank you.

244
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,040
Thank you.

245
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,820
Dookie has some guanyun eyebrows.

246
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,560
No!

247
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:25,740
No!

248
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,900
Thank you for the, uh, super chat.

249
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,280
Thank you.

250
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,060
Thank you.

251
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,900
Um, anyway, so, so, there's that.

252
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:48,580
And then, I got really sad because I was, like, oh, man, I'm so excited that I get to go to this place, uh, because it was next to the bank.

253
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:55,800
I was, like, oh, my God, like, the mall was next to, um, I was, like, oh, yeah, I can go to this mall that's close by.

254
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,340
And, like, it has my favorite ice cream place.

255
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,440
I can't believe this happened twice.

256
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,320
Like, it's actually crazy.

257
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,860
I went to the mall and I was, like, yay, ice cream!

258
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,680
And it was gone.

259
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,200
It was... The store was no more.

260
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,980
This ice cream store was gone.

261
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,400
It wasn't even closed.

262
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,780
It was just gone.

263
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,760
I was, like, I was here last month.

264
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,600
I was, like, not again!

265
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,540
It happened again!

266
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,540
I was, like, yay, ice cream!

267
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,600
And then, it was gone.

268
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:45,500
And then, again, if I had nickel every time I went to a mall that I never... I haven't been to in a long time just for the ice cream, I'd have two nickels.

269
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,540
It's weird that it happened twice within the year.

270
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,840
Two different ice cream stores!

271
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,600
Two different ones!

272
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,310
Oh, my God.

273
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:03,470
It was my favorite ice cream store!

274
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,290
My other favorite one.

275
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,770
I had, like, several favorite ice cream stores.

276
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:14,310
So, uh, bro, we just started the year.

277
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,630
Calm down.

278
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:24,250
So, that was basically, um, story time for, like, today.

279
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:28,270
So, very, uh, very exciting and sad day.

280
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:38,250
Yeah, that's, yeah, it's been, it's been a very exciting and sad day today.

281
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,210
So, I've been, like, very busy.

282
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:45,450
Yeah, I was very busy in the, in the evening because, like, of all the stuff that was going on and everything.

283
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,150
Uh, but yeah, is there anything else that happened today?

284
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,650
No, it was just that.

285
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:51,990
I think it was, yeah, it was just that.

286
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,770
Anyway, Dynasty Warriors!

287
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,530
I'm super duper excited to play Dynasty Warriors.

288
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:03,370
If you guys didn't know about me, um, I grew up with the Dynasty Warrior games since Dynasty Warriors 1.

289
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:08,710
Um, basically, it was my, me and my dad's favorite game series.

290
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:15,250
Um, my dad loved Dynasty Warriors and he would buy every game and he would play it with me.

291
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:21,110
Um, and we would just do, like, uh, uh, we would just, like, you know, we would play co-op together and everything.

292
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,910
Uh, also, Rush, thank you for the super chat.

293
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:24,750
Thank you, thank you.

294
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,090
Hi, Doki, thank you so much for the almost daily apps to brighten our days.

295
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,470
It's my birthday today and I just turned 30.

296
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,410
Is it okay to ask for a birthday greeting for me?

297
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,090
Of course!

298
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,070
Happy birthday to you.

299
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,870
Happy birthday to you.

300
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,850
Happy birthday dear Rush.

301
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,410
Happy birthday to you.

302
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,750
Yeah, happy birthday!

303
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:42,810
Woo!

304
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:51,790
But yes, um, I started at Dynasty Warriors 1, um, on the PlayStation 1 because my dad was obsessed with it.

305
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:55,610
And, um, because of it, he would make me play with him Dynasty Warriors.

306
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,690
And I've always loved the, uh, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms story.

307
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:03,090
It's always been, like, one of the most famous stories in, in China.

308
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,250
And, um, and I've actually read the books.

309
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,570
I've seen the movies.

310
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:13,670
Um, I've seen the live action adaptations of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and the Three Kingdoms in general.

311
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:22,150
And, um, and, um, so it's just, you know, it's, I've had a long history with Dynasty Warriors.

312
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:27,350
Um, and I also played the, uh, the Strategist one, the Strategies one.

313
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:31,330
And then they had, like, I think, I'm pretty sure they had, like, crossovers and stuff like that.

314
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:36,570
I tried to play as many of the spin, many spinoffs of the Dynasty Warriors series.

315
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:41,090
Um, and, uh, I saw, I saw the Red Cliff movie.

316
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:45,710
I saw the Red Cliff movie on, um, in theaters.

317
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:51,730
Uh, um, so, like, it was honestly, I only, I, it was so good.

318
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:56,490
I remember watching it in theaters when it first came out, um, in, in China.

319
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,550
And it's actually one of my favorite movies.

320
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:05,610
Uh, but yeah, uh, and, uh, let's see what else can I talk about it.

321
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,370
I used to really like Liu Bei.

322
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:16,590
I don't anymore because I sort of grew up and realized, I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute.

323
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,970
He's, uh, he's not that good.

324
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,570
I was like, he's not really a good leader.

325
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:39,790
He's not really, he, he has good people working for him, but he's a terrible leader with a fucking terrible son.

326
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:48,830
And also because, like, and then he, they made him a baby face.

327
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:54,430
I actually went to Liu Bei's, um, temple, uh, temple when I, when I was younger.

328
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:59,150
I went to his temple and, like, his gravesite and everything, and also Cao Cao.

329
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:11,350
I used to call him Cao Cao, but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna trigger a few people because the English dub of Dynasty Warriors used to call him Cao Cao, and then I would just call him Cao Cao all the time because of it.

330
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:21,350
And, and I know that's, like, not the right pronunciation of Cao, it's Cao Cao, but I'm gonna call him Cao Cao, guys.

331
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:21,930
I don't care.

332
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,450
I, I care, but, like, I'm sorry.

333
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,150
I should care.

334
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:25,950
I should care.

335
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:32,210
I should care, but also, like, um, I just, I don't know.

336
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,430
It's just ingrained in my head now.

337
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,910
It's, it's ingrained in my head.

338
00:34:38,350 --> 00:35:00,230
Um, um, but yes, um, I did, I even went to, like, the temples of, um, of Liu Bei and, um, I wrote, actually wrote, like, a paper about Zhuge Liang, uh, Zhuge Liang, Zhuge Liang, and, um, it was really funny because I told the story before, but in high school or,

339
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:16,630
like, in middle, in, like, ninth grade, I wrote a paper about, uh, Zhuge Liang, uh, Zhuge Liang, and, like, about, because you're, like, choose a person, it was, like, choose a historical figure that you believe should be, um, should, um, that achieved greatness or something.

340
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,390
I don't remember the story.

341
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:23,390
I don't remember the actual topic, but we just had to choose a historical figure that, like, achieved something great in history.

342
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:28,350
So I chose him because I was super fucking obsessed with him and... oh, I need to blow my nose.

343
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:30,970
Sneeze.

344
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:49,550
And then, um, the thing is, at that time, I didn't really realize how much the books embellished him and the games embellished him.

345
00:35:49,970 --> 00:36:00,330
And that was the day I learned, when I did that paper, that was the day I learned that, like, that, like, they didn't do much.

346
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:12,090
Because, like, the book and the play, it was, like, a romance of the three kingdoms.

347
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,890
So that's what romance meant.

348
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:25,050
So, so, like, I found out from, like, it was, they, like, basically, I still love Ju-Gil-Yeon.

349
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:30,950
I still love him as a character, but not, like, a historical figure anymore.

350
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:36,170
Yeah, they're, like, historical fantasies.

351
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:41,330
So, like, you don't really know if, like, some of these things actually happen.

352
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,290
Never research your heroes.

353
00:36:43,650 --> 00:37:02,070
So, so, so, when I, when I was trying, when I was researching him, and, um, I got, like, um, the, the teacher was, like, I believe you think he was of great importance, but he's not really.

354
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,930
I remember that was one of my notes.

355
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:15,430
It's just, like, it's just, like, I can tell that you think he provided a lot to the world, but in reality, he didn't actually.

356
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,330
I'm, like, oh, man.

357
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,280
A sad reality.

358
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,360
A community noted by teacher.

359
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,940
Oh, the heart is true.

360
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:42,020
Zane, my childhood was a lie, but he was so cool.

361
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,920
He was the actor for him.

362
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,160
For him, Redcliffe was so hot, too.

363
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,640
He looked so cool in every media adaptation.

364
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,820
What do you mean?

365
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,180
He wasn't actually cool.

366
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,460
What do you mean he didn't do all of these things?

367
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:16,560
So, um, so anyway, so that's basically my history with Dynasty Warriors.

368
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,800
So, I'm very excited to...

369
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,680
I'm very excited to try the game out.

370
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:32,500
Apparently, people are saying that the newest game is, um, is actually really good compared to the last one, which isn't saying much because the last one I'm sorry.

371
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,180
Please don't.

372
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,920
Please don't hurt me, Japan.

373
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,720
Please don't hurt me.

374
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,220
Is it Konami, please?

375
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,260
It's a pretty low bar.

376
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,760
Oh, my God.

377
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,600
Koei, sorry.

378
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,320
Koei.

379
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,520
I was like, oh, my God.

380
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,280
It starts with K.

381
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,180
I was like, it starts with K.

382
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:56,740
Koei, please.

383
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,280
I'm sorry.

384
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,900
I love your games.

385
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:11,560
But, like, anyway, um, um, it's not a high bar in terms of, like, being an improvement to, like, to, like, the last game.

386
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,780
So, so, I, I'm excited.

387
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,700
I am really excited.

388
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,980
We haven't had Dynasty Warriors game in a very, in a while.

389
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,820
I think, when was the last Dynasty Warriors game?

390
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,600
It's been a long time because the reception for the last one wasn't the greatest.

391
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:35,120
So, people were, so, they, like, held out on creating a new Dynasty Warriors for the longest time.

392
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:40,860
So, like, um, yeah, it's been a long, long, long time since they made a new one.

393
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,820
So, I'm super excited.

394
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,900
I cannot wait to basically go through the, the, what was it called?

395
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:48,740
Oh, my God.

396
00:39:48,760 --> 00:40:15,480
It's been so, I can't wait to become sworn brothers again and then pursue Lu Bu and, um, and then, um, and then do the Red Cliff all over again and then watch, uh, Lu, and then watch, uh, uh, Zhuge Liang trying to fucking salvage the Shu empire, but he can't because Lu Bei's son is a fucking,

397
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,880
what, how do I phrase this nicely?

398
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,520
He is worthless.

399
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:45,260
He is, he is not, but you guys didn't know, um, the reason why Lu Bei's son is, like, uh, worthless is because Lu, apparently, I'm not sure if it's true or if this was romanticized, but Lu Bei dropped his son on his head.

400
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:53,220
So, like, and then he became the leader after Lu Bei died and I was just like, oh, no, that's a good idea.

401
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,740
Like, I don't know.

402
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,260
I don't, I don't know.

403
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,960
That's me saying it nicely.

404
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,640
Apparently threw him and twice.

405
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,900
So, like, but then he ended up becoming the leader afterwards.

406
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:16,000
So, um, yeah, no wonder the Shu empire fucking never took off.

407
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,160
It never, it never took off in the end.

408
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,660
Um, but yeah, I'm super excited.

409
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,960
Uh, all right, booting up the game.

410
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,620
I hope my sound guys, sound guys are here.

411
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,300
Uh, isn't supported.

412
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,440
Oh, wait, my DualSense, do I have to use my Xbox controller?

413
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:46,840
It says my DualSense controller isn't supported, so I'll get my, I'll get my Xbox controller and see if it's better.

414
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:47,880
I don't know.

415
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,340
Okay, does my Xbox controller work?

416
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,140
Sorry, I'm like trying to see which controller.

417
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:58,780
Oh, it is.

418
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,120
Okay.

419
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:00,580
All right.

420
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,620
No, it says for Dynasty Warriors, it doesn't work like that.

421
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,740
Uh, no, I agree.

422
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:19,100
And then, um, after that, my favorite kingdom was, um, um, I guess it was Wu after that, because is it Wu?

423
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,500
Um, I, I like, I like certain characters in different kingdoms.

424
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:34,800
So, um, um, maybe, um, I used to like Wu.

425
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,260
I used to like Wu.

426
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,980
And I guess because of, what's her name?

427
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,260
Sun Shan Shan?

428
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,120
The, the girl.

429
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,660
Sun Shan Shan.

430
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:54,340
But then I found out that she didn't do much in actuality.

431
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,080
Don't research your heroes.

432
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,220
Because she was my favorite.

433
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,800
She was, I would play her since Dynasty Warriors 1.

434
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,360
I would always play her, because I loved her character.

435
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,240
But then I found out that she was like a nobody.

436
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:14,560
She was like, she had, don't research your heroes.

437
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,100
Like...

438
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,360
And then I got so sad.

439
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,740
I was like, what are you trying to tell me?

440
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:28,860
She actually had no significant importance in, in the story.

441
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:40,780
They only put her in the game because she was a girl and they needed a girl character in the Dynasty Warriors.

442
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,560
They made up things about her.

443
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:45,200
Like,

444
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:54,120
they made up stuff about her in the games that I thought was real.

445
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:57,500
And I was like, what do you mean she didn't do all this?

446
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,140
The bitter truth.

447
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,800
She had to be the girl in the game, because they needed girls in the game.

448
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,540
But she had no significant importance.

449
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,320
I thought she was so cool.

450
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,540
I thought she was so cool.

451
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,880
And I was like, oh my god, she's so cool.

452
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,780
Oh my god, I want to be just like her.

453
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,620
Don't research your heroes.

454
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,600
Don't, don't research your heroes.

455
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,780
No, the game is historically canon.

456
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,100
It keeps hurting every time you say it.

457
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:03,520
Yeah, but at that time, when I was younger, I was like, so obsessed with like, with her.

458
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:07,460
She was literally the only character I would play.

459
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:14,060
For like, the first three to four games, for the first three games, I would only play her and I would play her storyline.

460
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,480
And I thought her storyline was true.

461
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:21,400
I was like, her storyline is real to me.

462
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,080
I thought her story was true.

463
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,880
I played her storyline and everything.

464
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,300
And then...

465
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,540
No, but the English dub is so funny.

466
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,800
I'm sorry.

467
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:42,280
I grew up with the English dub and it's so funny.

468
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,480
I love, I'm sorry.

469
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,200
I actually love the English dub.

470
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,520
You don't understand.

471
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:51,340
It's actually one of my, one of my favorites from Dynasty Warriors.

472
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,920
It's legitimately the English dub.

473
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:01,600
It's one of my, it's actually like one of my favorite parts about Dynasty Warriors.

474
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,140
Yeah, they like, I'm so sorry.

475
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,520
I know it's like, they like butcher names.

476
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,060
Um, they butcher names.

477
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:14,080
They like, the dubbing is like super silly sometimes, but that's what makes it peak.

478
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,800
It's, it's peak to me.

479
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,140
Um, Gambit, thank you for the super chat.

480
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:24,500
Thank you.

481
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,300
Thank you.

482
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,000
It was real to me.

483
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,040
How else would I hear Lupe talk about benevolence for the 800th time?

484
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,500
How else?

485
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,580
It's the only way to play the game.

486
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,580
All right.

487
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,780
All right, perform initial setup.

488
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:44,700
Yes.

489
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,440
It's so iconic.

490
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,320
Exactly.

491
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,200
You know, that power of my match.

492
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,860
I love like, oh, what was the, the yellow?

493
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,040
Um, how is it called?

494
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,860
The yellow, it's been so long since I've...

495
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,640
Three kingdoms.

496
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,520
The yellow rebellion.

497
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,440
I love like, the leader of the yellow rebellion's voice actor.

498
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,040
Um, the yellow turban.

499
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,900
Yeah, the, what was the leader's name?

500
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,700
I love his voice in the English dub, because it's so fucking silly.

501
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:22,700
Like, it's, it's so silly whenever, um, whenever he talks and he's like, I'm gonna curse you.

502
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,220
It's legit, and it makes me so happy.

503
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,980
That's why I love the English dub.

504
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,100
It's actually, it's actually one of my favorite shit.

505
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,100
I wish I talked like him.

506
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,080
Um, let's see.

507
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,340
Does that even change?

508
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:51,740
All right.

509
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,690
All right, here we go.

510
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,610
It's you?

511
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:08,110
Oh, oh my God, it's CGI.

512
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,820
Promise you what?

513
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,620
Oh, it's so pretty.

514
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,000
Yeah, the CGI looks really beautiful.

515
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,660
Why is Brokhan a cute doll?

516
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,740
That's me, right?

517
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:39,850
That's me, right?

518
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:41,090
Yeah, I'm the nameless hero.

519
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:48,030
Year six of the Guan He era, or 150 years since the start of the Eastern Hong dynasty.

520
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:54,030
Oh, I love... Zhang He was my dad's favorite character.

521
00:48:55,450 --> 00:49:00,770
Him, it was him and Xiaohudun, which is funny because they're so different from each other.

522
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:07,970
Zhang He and Xiaohudun, um, was my dad's favorite characters.

523
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:10,450
They're like two sides of a coin.

524
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:21,330
A drought that's been ongoing since the previous years and barrage of inclement weather resulted in devastating famine.

525
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,010
The people were starving, resulting to eating grass.

526
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,800
They're gonna- oh my God, they're gonna eat grass?

527
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,600
What a miserable place.

528
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,680
Unfortunately, Xiaohudun is like almost everybody's favorite character.

529
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,740
Because he looked so cool.

530
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,100
He had one eye.

531
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,540
He had an eye patch.

532
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,280
So fucking cool.

533
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,760
And he had a giant ass sword.

534
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,020
Guan Yun?

535
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,980
Why you look like that?

536
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,720
Why does he have short hair?

537
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,700
He's young.

538
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,700
I like how he's young, but he still has his glorious beard.

539
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,140
So hungry.

540
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,080
We're so hungry.

541
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,640
Pro is 30?

542
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,140
What do you mean?

543
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,140
That is not like young, like young, young.

544
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,500
Oh no, not the child!

545
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:00,900
Oh my God.

546
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:05,380
If you are 30 and you can grow a beard like that, that's fucking cool.

547
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,100
Oh my God.

548
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,900
Why it's me?

549
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,000
I'm so cool.

550
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,900
Oh my God, look at that.

551
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,620
I could do that.

552
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,720
Yeah, if you're 30.

553
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,260
No, I mean like back then in like ancient China, you can grow to old age.

554
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:39,180
Unlike like, unlike Europe, because you guys had the plague.

555
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:49,740
I mean, it doesn't help that at that time, Europe was going through like several plagues and they were like shitting outside.

556
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:50,920
And...

557
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,320
You're fair enough.

558
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:11,140
Who are you, long-haired man?

559
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,360
Oh my God, the BGM is so, so nostalgic, guys.

560
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,480
The... oh my God.

561
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,820
Oh, that is my Dynasty Warriors BGM right there!

562
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:30,780
There it is!

563
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,260
Oh my God, you're so cool, Guan Yun!

564
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,220
I hope nothing bad happens to you in battle!

565
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,580
Oh, man!

566
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,280
He's so cool.

567
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:48,960
There's no way anything bad's gonna happen to him, especially in battle, resulting in any betrayal.

568
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,780
Don't visit anymore!

569
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,320
It's okay, he's still poor Shadow.

570
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,020
That sure would be sad.

571
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,840
There's no way.

572
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:08,440
I hope he's not gonna get backstabbed anytime soon!

573
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,160
That would never happen, right?

574
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:20,140
And then your sworn brothers all suffer a terrible fate too, but that's not gonna happen.

575
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,780
I hope he never loses his head.

576
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:32,000
I mean... not soon, soon!

577
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:35,120
Don't spoil the story!

578
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:40,880
Oh, the story that's been, like, retold, like, 20,000 times!

579
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,500
Oh, man!

580
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,520
Not... not that story!

581
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,960
Okay, nice.

582
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:57,380
Defense is the key?

583
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:00,600
This is Dynasty Warriors, there's no defense here!

584
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,260
But it's new to me!

585
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:16,740
What I love is that Dynasty Warriors can retell the story, like, they can make Dynasty Warriors 50 and I'll still buy the game.

586
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:23,280
They can retell the Yellow Turban War to me, like, 500 times and I'll still be like...

587
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,120
Be afraid of my magic!

588
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,640
That's true loyalty!

589
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:35,920
Oh, evade!

590
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,520
Okay, true!

591
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,800
We just eat it up!

592
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,680
Okay, L-Y-Y... wait, what?

593
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,820
Oh, okay, so this is a stronger attack.

594
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,060
The power of the heavens!

595
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,220
I'll be like, say the line!

596
00:54:52,820 --> 00:55:00,480
I'll be, like, 80 and I'll boot up Dynasty Warriors and he would be like... I'll be like, say the line!

597
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,420
Say the line, Lupe!

598
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,000
And I'll be like, for benevolence!

599
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,420
I'll be like, yay!

600
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:15,750
Same, same!

601
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:19,930
I'll be like, this is where they become...

602
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:22,390
We are back in the fucking gardens.

603
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:26,150
This is where they become... I'll be like, chat children!

604
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:29,310
This is where they become...

605
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:32,110
Become sworn brothers!

606
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:37,650
What is this?

607
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:39,210
You're out of luck!

608
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:42,990
This is where you scoundrels meet your end!

609
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,310
That can't be right!

610
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:47,790
That can't be right!

611
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:51,230
I just started this game, so I know I'm gonna live!

612
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:55,350
We may be outnumbered, but we must not falter!

613
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:58,910
Oh, who's that?

614
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:02,130
Who's that?

615
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:04,930
I don't need a name.

616
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:27,370
Is that Jack?

617
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,090
Is that...

618
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:33,290
Wait, that's Jengel?

619
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,810
What happened to your silly voice?

620
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:37,570
No, he's hot!

621
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:39,010
Oh my god!

622
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:42,110
For the first time, they made him hot!

623
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,290
I don't know how to feel about this!

624
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,170
Holy shit!

625
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:49,290
Wait, he's hot now!

626
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:54,210
What a clone!

627
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:57,230
The wizard is not silly anymore!

628
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:59,930
He isn't old and silly!

629
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:02,950
Oh my god!

630
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:04,330
He is!

631
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,450
Look, he does look like Jack!

632
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:07,030
Jesus!

633
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:09,300
Oh my god!

634
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:11,670
Why is he hot?

635
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,430
What about the magic?

636
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:21,230
Holy shit!

637
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,410
Where is all of this?

638
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:27,650
That shit-shot looks like that!

639
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:31,290
Oh no!

640
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,070
He made him hot!

641
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:38,390
That's actually crazy!

642
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:42,110
I did not expect that to be him!

643
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:43,230
Oh my god!

644
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:44,270
Oh my god!

645
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:45,010
Look at me go!

646
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:50,070
Not gonna lie though, I don't really want to play as a nameless hero.

647
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:55,590
I think the fun- the most fun- oh nice!

648
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:56,410
Musou attack!

649
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:03,990
I think like the most fun part about Dynasty Warriors- okay, where's my bow?

650
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:05,310
I need bread!

651
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,250
I need- I don't- I need bread right now!

652
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:13,970
I need- I'd rather- I want to play as like- I want to play Guan Yu!

653
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:17,550
Let me handle this for now.

654
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:22,270
I need Mantle.

655
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:23,790
Oh my god, Guan Yu!

656
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:24,230
Oh!

657
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:24,770
Deathwing!

658
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:25,430
Deathscore!

659
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:28,270
Yes!

660
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:29,730
Insane!

661
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:31,330
That's fucking right!

662
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:33,350
The game heard me!

663
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:36,390
Let's go!

664
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:40,430
Oh my god, he heard me!

665
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:41,750
I was like, I want to play Guan Yu!

666
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:43,590
He's like, all right, Ben, here you go!

667
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:46,050
I willed it into existence!

668
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:48,310
It's the newest patch!

669
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,230
Ask and you shall receive!

670
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:51,590
Look at me go!

671
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:54,150
I'll never die and I'll have my head!

672
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:56,870
My head will always be a part of my body!

673
00:58:57,110 --> 00:59:00,350
That's so oddly specific, but I just want you guys to be sure!

674
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,010
I just want you guys to know that for sure!

675
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:07,850
I know it's very oddly specific, but don't worry!

676
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:13,330
Oh wait, what's my Musou attack?

677
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:17,910
Nice!

678
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:22,190
Why?

679
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:26,430
What an oddly specific thing to say, Doki!

680
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:33,210
900.

681
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:35,110
Oh wait, I don't want to beat him!

682
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:36,770
I don't- where's my Mantle?

683
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:37,810
Where is it?

684
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:41,630
Oh, I'm so fucking- Oh, this is bad.

685
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:43,150
This is actually- Oh!

686
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:46,570
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

687
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:48,410
How is there no bread?

688
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:49,670
How is there no bread?

689
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:51,050
How is there no bread?

690
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,330
How is there no bread?

691
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:54,130
What do I do?

692
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:55,410
What do I do?

693
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:57,010
I don't have bread!

694
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:00,430
I don't- Ha, Chen Xiao!

695
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:01,410
Go, go kill him!

696
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:07,290
But Dynasty Warriors was never about defense!

697
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:11,330
It was never about defense when-

698
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:17,550
Guys, don't you know that?

699
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:21,770
Dynasty Warriors never did anything about defense!

700
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:26,650
So like- Oh my god, he's getting closer.

701
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:28,270
He's getting closer!

702
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:30,270
Oh nice!

703
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:32,390
Oh my god, yes!

704
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:35,310
1 HP and a dream!

705
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:40,970
Welcome back to difficulty!

706
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:43,610
There we go.

707
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:44,510
I did it.

708
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:46,090
I told you I can do defense.

709
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:50,030
Just don't die, streamer.

710
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:51,810
Kalsi, thank you for the super chat.

711
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:52,710
Thank you, thank you.

712
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,670
I believe he's hot now.

713
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:56,150
It is him!

714
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:57,210
He has the staff!

715
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:58,590
Wait, it is him!

716
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:01,490
Oh my god!

717
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:06,090
My silly wizard!

718
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:08,230
My silly wizard!

719
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:13,510
Bad knight!

720
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:23,230
Hello, Guan Yun.

721
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,710
It's nice to see you alive and well.

722
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:33,590
Of course!

723
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:39,170
That's how he gain f- Guan Yun!

724
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,910
You didn't actually tell it to him because of the beard.

725
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:44,690
Without even asking your name.

726
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:46,890
Tell me, what are you called?

727
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:52,870
Um, we all know.

728
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:00,950
Okay, there we go.

729
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:02,090
How could they know?

730
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:03,950
How could they know?

731
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:08,410
I cannot tell you!

732
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:10,170
How would they know?

733
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,130
How naturally!

734
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:17,590
The bank people definitely didn't know.

735
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:20,930
You will be called Nod Doheed.

736
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,770
Do you wish to proceed?

737
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:24,310
Yes.

738
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:29,130
Hmm.

739
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,170
I don't know.

740
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:39,090
Hmm.

741
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:42,270
I don't know.

742
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:43,630
That is quite intriguing.

743
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:44,750
Where could I be from?

744
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,560
You fought with such effortless skill.

745
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:53,180
I've never seen anything like it.

746
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:56,480
I'm curious to know where you trained.

747
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,250
It's the same answer.

748
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:04,290
Oh, yeah, sorry.

749
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:07,810
It's I've forgotten and I can't remember.

750
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:10,250
Like, I feel like I should say it.

751
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:12,430
It's the same one.

752
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:14,110
It's the same answer.

753
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:19,130
Um, I forgot.

754
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:26,450
So you have no memory of your past?

755
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:28,790
I hit my head.

756
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:32,430
My dad dropped- my dad threw me on the ground twice.

757
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:37,930
In any case, it was fortunate I met you when I did.

758
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:43,750
Most wandering warriors won't lift a finger until they hear talk.

759
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:45,910
Whoa, Nod Doheed, I saw you at the bank.

760
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:47,530
Marshall, thank you for the super chat.

761
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:47,950
Thank you.

762
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,730
I don't know and I really like the color green.

763
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:53,110
But you are not like the others.

764
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:57,990
I see you walk an honorable path wielding your blade for the weak.

765
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:02,210
I was told to do so.

766
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:05,790
I think I should be on the other side of the- oh my god, guys.

767
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:07,990
I know it's gonna look weird, guys.

768
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:10,070
Guys, don't be weird about this.

769
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:14,830
But I think I have to be on the- I know it's gonna- I know you're not used to this, guys.

770
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:17,810
But I think I actually have to be on the other side.

771
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:18,230
I-

772
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:23,570
Left side doki.

773
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:26,710
I think I have to be left side doki for today.

774
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:29,630
Don't- don't be weird about this, guys.

775
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:30,310
Don't be.

776
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:43,950
I'm scared of change.

777
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:48,170
What?

778
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:50,290
Of like corruption?

779
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,730
You mean like the rest of the world?

780
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:00,610
Next scene.

781
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:01,850
Thank you for the super chat.

782
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:02,670
Thank you.

783
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:07,750
My question is, is John Fae hot too?

784
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:09,610
Thank you for the super chat.

785
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:11,490
I mean, his daughter's hot.

786
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:15,070
I don't even know if that's also romanticized.

787
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:25,470
Perhaps this is heaven's way of lamenting the state of the land.

788
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:30,370
The heavens feel sadness?

789
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:32,470
The will of the heavens is absolute.

790
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:50,590
Oh, and the yellow turbans?

791
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:58,370
Their ranks are growing rapidly.

792
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:06,270
Their promises of a brighter future must be drawing in the powerless masses.

793
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:11,110
I've spoken too much.

794
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:13,010
It is already grown late.

795
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,960
Wow, actually decent pronunciation.

796
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:23,860
Yeah, they got better at it after like the fourth game.

797
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:27,980
Yeah, because it was so weird because like they used to call him Cao Cao.

798
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:37,280
And then I didn't realize his real name was actually Tao Tao because my dad never explained it to me, even though he was like, he's like full Chinese.

799
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,500
And like, so like he'd also call him Cao Cao.

800
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:41,940
So I thought that was real.

801
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:45,300
And then after the fourth game, they suddenly changed his name to Tao Tao.

802
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:46,960
And I was like, what is this?

803
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,960
I was like, why did they change his name?

804
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:55,110
This is not historically accurate, but like...

805
01:06:56,580 --> 01:07:01,560
I was a fool, because before then it wasn't historically accurate.

806
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,500
And then they try to be historically accurate.

807
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:10,880
A country that has long been divided will reunite.

808
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,800
One that has long been united will become divided.

809
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:22,900
Long ago, the Han dynasty was founded by Emperor Gaozu and re-established by Emperor Guangfu.

810
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,080
Who the fuck are you?

811
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,400
You were never in my dad's stories.

812
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:29,300
Heaven's will is now clear.

813
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,780
The coming age will inevitably be one of great chaos.

814
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:36,440
Who invaded this child?

815
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,180
That is why.

816
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:43,420
You must bring peace to the world.

817
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:44,200
Me?

818
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:47,840
Not Doki?

819
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,480
I'm gonna unite the three kingdoms?

820
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,240
Rise now, guardian of peace.

821
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,940
Oh my God, you're gonna see me in the history books.

822
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,510
That's... Dual Si?

823
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,500
Wait, is that actually...

824
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:23,640
I'm the chosen... I've always known I was the chosen one, guys.

825
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:27,300
There's no way that's...

826
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,520
They made him into a giant!

827
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:31,700
They made him!

828
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:33,440
There's no way!

829
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,940
There's no way!

830
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:07,580
I love the CGI.

831
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,040
It's so pretty though.

832
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,980
The CGI is really beautiful.

833
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:21,440
Oh.

834
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,760
Yeah, it looks really, really good.

835
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:27,660
I love the CGI.

836
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,660
Wait, am I going... Is this the intro now?

837
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,720
Did I just finish the tutorial?

838
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:42,300
Some poor kid is going to do a report in three kingdoms.

839
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:43,540
Hero, not Doki.

840
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,080
I hope you're happy with yourself.

841
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,420
Papa smurf, thank you for the super chat.

842
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:48,920
Thank you.

843
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:49,660
Thank you.

844
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:55,310
That's me, I'm remembering my first battle.

845
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,300
Oh my God.

846
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,820
Oh, the classic.

847
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:05,660
Oh, the classic intro!

848
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:09,840
Oh my God!

849
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:14,920
Let's fucking go!

850
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:18,340
I love the intros.

851
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:19,640
The intros are my favorite.

852
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:21,600
Oh my God, there he is.

853
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,620
He's finally old now.

854
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,260
Oh my God, that's Redcliffe!

855
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,800
It's not Zhao Yun!

856
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:28,200
Yeah!

857
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:29,880
Do not pursue Lu.

858
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:33,480
Guys, oh my God, I'm Zhao Yun now!

859
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,880
Oh my God, it's Zhao Yun!

860
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,620
Koei's like, goodbye Zhao Yun.

861
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,440
I'm done playing with you.

862
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:48,200
Oh my God, fucking finally!

863
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,660
A major upheaval began.

864
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:56,360
By extending a hand to suffering peasants, the Way of the Great Peace gained immense support.

865
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,420
Zhang Zhao, the movement's founder.

866
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:03,540
Do not pursue- what are you doing?

867
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:11,460
In aid of the provinces, countless adherents of the Way of the Great Peace- This is what I don't understand.

868
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,660
For some reason, Koei fucking loves Zhao Yun.

869
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,800
Like, they put him in everything.

870
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:25,800
They're like- It's like- He's literally in every cover and like, intro.

871
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,880
He's like- yeah, he's the poster boy.

872
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,820
He's like, he's so handsome.

873
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:36,040
He has to be everywhere.

874
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:40,320
Heroes rise in the midst of turmoil.

875
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,440
Two months after the Yellow Turbans uprising.

876
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,060
He was my dad's favorite character, too.

877
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,620
It was Zhao- Just because like, he was everywhere.

878
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:58,520
I feel like my dad only liked him because he was everywhere.

879
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:03,140
And Zhao Yun was like, overpowered as hell, too.

880
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:25,360
What the fuck?

881
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:26,460
I'm Godzilla.

882
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:32,220
You journey through this vast world on your own two feet.

883
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:37,600
Your path shall become clear through numerous encounters and- I did not expect this part.

884
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:40,500
I was like, what the fuck?

885
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,840
I did not expect this part of the game.

886
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,140
I'm big now.

887
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:54,100
This is interesting.

888
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:54,600
Yeah.

889
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:00,680
Historically accurate size.

890
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,500
That's me.

891
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:12,880
How could- but the linear's hot!

892
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:19,960
If cruel, why hot?

893
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,060
So you have Jean?

894
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:44,880
Oh, it's time to fight the Yellow Turb- but we fought together!

895
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:47,460
Me and him and Guan Yun!

896
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,020
We fought together!

897
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:54,060
How could he be evil?

898
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,300
No way!

899
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,080
Homies for life!

900
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:12,400
There's no backstabbing during the three- I can't even say that in a serious face.

901
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,440
Everybody backstabbed.

902
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,300
There was no actual friends...

903
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:18,620
during this time.

904
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:35,790
Bro, thank you for the super chat.

905
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:36,130
Thank you.

906
01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:36,750
Thank you.

907
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:39,510
There was so much backstabbing.

908
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:41,270
I'm not afraid.

909
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:45,170
That's right.

910
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:46,770
That's me.

911
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:01,930
Oh my god, Mercenary?

912
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:15,850
No, come on, girl!

913
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:16,390
Gossip!

914
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:17,930
Who's gonna know?

915
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:19,550
I won't snitch you...

916
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:20,850
to the- to the General.

917
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:23,250
But never!

918
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:27,490
Anyway, what's your name- full name and designation?

919
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:30,210
Who is the governor?

920
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:31,130
Yeah, who is he?

921
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:37,090
Oh, I see.

922
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:43,070
He was dismayed by the chaos and turmoil, so he's raising an army to defeat the Yellow Turbans.

923
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:45,170
A truly great man.

924
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:48,950
Tell me about this force.

925
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:52,190
It's a small army of volunteers recruited to fight the Yellow Turbans.

926
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:55,850
Who are growing bolder and more unruly by the day.

927
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:00,990
What are you doing?

928
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:06,030
I remember when everyone believed the way of the Great Peace would make the world a better place.

929
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:10,730
Alright, that's enough questions.

930
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:12,270
Well, the day's still young.

931
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:15,670
Once you've unpacked, I suggest you visit the town.

932
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:19,470
Now, if you will excuse me.

933
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:25,030
Alright, it's time to explore the town.

934
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:27,490
I already like this more than the last game.

935
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:30,010
The last game felt so empty.

936
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:35,710
Especially like...

937
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:38,390
The CGI was not the best too.

938
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:41,230
The inn acts as a base during your travels.

939
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,930
Letters may arrive from time to time.

940
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:47,290
Reading letters allows you to learn what's going on in the world and can sometimes advance the story.

941
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:48,710
Who wrote to me?

942
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:54,650
The Yellow Turbans, selling chaos throughout the realm, are now descending upon Yo's province.

943
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:56,010
Local government...

944
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:57,390
Okay, so that's...

945
01:16:57,390 --> 01:16:59,990
Has been decreed that those who fight to bring order to the realm...

946
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,470
Shall be provided with gold.

947
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:03,030
Oh my god, I love gold.

948
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:04,610
Oh my god, there we go.

949
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:05,870
I haven't done anything yet.

950
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:08,190
But like, I already got 10,000 gold.

951
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:10,050
I feel like you should pay before...

952
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:11,010
After...

953
01:17:11,010 --> 01:17:12,690
Cause like...

954
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:15,230
If you pay them now...

955
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,970
What if they just die?

956
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:18,170
Like...

957
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:20,310
I don't know.

958
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:22,330
Is that just me?

959
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:25,270
I feel like I should be paid after...

960
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:26,010
I survive.

961
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:28,550
Yay!

962
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:29,790
Signing bonus!

963
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:34,770
Nameless warrior garb.

964
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,010
Oh wait, isn't that...

965
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,190
I pre-ordered this.

966
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:38,990
Isn't this...

967
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:41,130
Wukong's outfit?

968
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:44,230
Apparently, if you pre-order it...

969
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:44,930
I think like...

970
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:47,070
They did like a collaboration with Wukong.

971
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:49,550
Oh, Wolong?

972
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:51,030
Oh, it's Wolong?

973
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:51,510
Oh my god!

974
01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:55,270
Nevermind.

975
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:56,150
Wrong Wu.

976
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:57,450
Wrong one.

977
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:02,700
Wolong, yeah.

978
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,800
I was like thinking...

979
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,400
I saw Wu and I was like...

980
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,060
Oh, Wukong!

981
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:08,220
And I was like...

982
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,300
Oh, it's Wolong.

983
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,480
And like, I fucking misread.

984
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:16,300
Like, I misread it.

985
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:21,840
Close enough.

986
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,120
I never played Wolong.

987
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:31,210
Wolong.

988
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:32,190
Wolong.

989
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:33,450
I never played Wolong.

990
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:34,210
Is it good?

991
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:39,290
I was thinking about...

992
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:39,850
Monkey.

993
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,710
I don't know if I should change...

994
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:45,770
I want the original clothes for now.

995
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:47,890
Alright, let's go out.

996
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:54,090
Time to go outside.

997
01:18:56,350 --> 01:18:57,190
Peaches!

998
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:03,230
Peaches!

999
01:19:03,370 --> 01:19:04,150
Peach, please.

1000
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,090
Oh!

1001
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:15,930
Please, sir.

1002
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:17,030
I'm so hungry.

1003
01:19:17,470 --> 01:19:18,950
What is this subtitle?

1004
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:19,550
No!

1005
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:21,470
Don't do crime!

1006
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:23,530
Crime does not pay!

1007
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,570
Is that jump...

1008
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:34,750
No way!

1009
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:36,630
That's...

1010
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:38,810
That's jumping!

1011
01:19:40,090 --> 01:19:41,590
No way!

1012
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:43,330
No!

1013
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:47,390
I recognize those muscles anywhere!

1014
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:48,130
I...

1015
01:19:52,210 --> 01:19:54,650
Why is he hot and fat?

1016
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:05,070
Hi.

1017
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:09,930
Is that Lupe?

1018
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:11,950
Oh my god, please tell me you have a mustache.

1019
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:13,150
Please tell me you must...

1020
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:14,130
Don't be babyface!

1021
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:17,370
Do not be babyface, Lupe!

1022
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:18,990
I swear to god!

1023
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:30,770
No!

1024
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:34,470
What is he...

1025
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:35,510
Oh my god!

1026
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:36,810
What the fuck!

1027
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:43,510
What is he...

1028
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:54,250
You're right, your lips is not long enough.

1029
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:56,690
What is he...

1030
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:57,450
Oh my god!

1031
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:01,230
What is...

1032
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:01,790
Yeah!

1033
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,910
Oh my god, he looks like a celeb.

1034
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:06,670
He looks like...

1035
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:12,280
He looks like the actor from Red Cliff!

1036
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:13,020
Wait!

1037
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:15,440
Okay, dude.

1038
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:19,180
He actually looks like the actor from...

1039
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:21,080
He looks like a fucking celeb.

1040
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:24,280
Okay, I need to show you guys what he looks like.

1041
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:25,800
I was like, wait a minute.

1042
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:27,860
He looks just like him.

1043
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:30,900
Yeah!

1044
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:38,340
He looks like...

1045
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:41,300
Um...

1046
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:41,680
Wait!

1047
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:43,800
Oh my god!

1048
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:45,560
But like, without...

1049
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,100
He does!

1050
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:49,240
He does look like him!

1051
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:52,260
Oh my god, why does he look like him?

1052
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,340
Why does...

1053
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:55,400
Okay, this is what he looks like to me.

1054
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:59,160
This is the actor for Chocolat in the Red Cliff.

1055
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:01,220
And I was like, oh my god, I always remember.

1056
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,280
Because I was like, oh, he's so hot as Chocolat.

1057
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:04,800
And I was like...

1058
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:07,860
I was like, oh my god, he's so hot.

1059
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,860
It looks just like him!

1060
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:12,840
Like, it actually...

1061
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,440
It actually looks...

1062
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:17,320
It actually looks just like him!

1063
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,900
Oh my god!

1064
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:24,380
It's him!

1065
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,680
Oh my god!

1066
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,660
Oh my god!

1067
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:33,830
I can't believe...

1068
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,620
Oh my god, why does he...

1069
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:37,540
Where's your mustache, Lupe?

1070
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,200
Where is it?

1071
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,860
And also, why is Jon fake?

1072
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:43,300
Why does...

1073
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:46,300
It's so weird that they're all so hot now!

1074
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:49,680
First they made Silly Wizard hot wizard!

1075
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:50,920
And then...

1076
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,280
Okay, let me get a drink.

1077
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:09,910
Sorry.

1078
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:11,070
I need a drink.

1079
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:13,390
I need to get my lemon Dongling Cha.

1080
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:16,110
I ordered Dongling Cha, and I...

1081
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:17,670
Oh, and I walked...

1082
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:25,450
I need to get my Dongling Cha.

1083
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:26,950
My lemon tea.

1084
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:28,290
I just...

1085
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:31,370
Oh my god, everybody's hot now.

1086
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:32,230
And it's so weird.

1087
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:33,250
I'm not used to this.

1088
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:37,310
I'm used to them being like, cool and like...

1089
01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:41,190
Like, you know, cool and old and...

1090
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:44,330
And like...

1091
01:23:44,330 --> 01:23:45,490
Old and stuff.

1092
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:53,900
Alright.

1093
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:01,060
I love Guan...

1094
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:01,740
Oh, Guan Yin!

1095
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,080
Remember me?

1096
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:09,420
From tips to twinks.

1097
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:11,620
He came in weird.

1098
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:12,060
Yes.

1099
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:15,620
I can't!

1100
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,220
He's so...

1101
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:18,420
I can't!

1102
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,720
He's so...

1103
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:23,620
I can't.

1104
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:25,480
I can't.

1105
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:29,300
He's so fucking buff.

1106
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:30,760
Like...

1107
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,140
Those muscles.

1108
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:45,280
Ah, ah.

1109
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,300
Those arms can feed a village.

1110
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:49,600
Don't thirst over Zhang Fei, guys.

1111
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:50,700
He's an alcoholic.

1112
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,720
Like, an extreme alcoholic.

1113
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:53,940
You think like...

1114
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:54,780
You know...

1115
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:57,400
He's like a really, really bad alcoholic.

1116
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:10,670
Look at this.

1117
01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:12,550
Look at this.

1118
01:25:19,670 --> 01:25:20,650
The eldest!

1119
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:27,730
He's the eldest!

1120
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:31,170
Yeah, by the way, Lu Fei's the eldest.

1121
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:39,590
How is he the eldest?

1122
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:41,390
I can't!

1123
01:25:57,230 --> 01:26:00,410
It's an unimpressive, but you know...

1124
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:03,210
I don't want him to have a big ego, guys.

1125
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:13,350
He has really, really good genes.

1126
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:14,010
So cute.

1127
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:30,750
Yeah!

1128
01:26:31,690 --> 01:26:32,570
Us three!

1129
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:38,430
Yeah, his earlobes aren't long enough.

1130
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:44,410
I hope like, over time, over the game time, they just make his earlobes longer and longer.

1131
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:46,030
But like, by like...

1132
01:26:46,030 --> 01:26:51,110
By like 0.1 centimeter every scene, so we don't notice until it's just like, wait a minute.

1133
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:58,560
I'm rewriting history.

1134
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:00,240
I'm gonna be the forks-worn brother.

1135
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:12,730
Yeah, his beard isn't full yet.

1136
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:14,210
So I'm pretty sure it could happen.

1137
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:27,450
I understand.

1138
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:31,410
Someone will get hurt and it's not gonna be me.

1139
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:40,150
Oh my god, I can't.

1140
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:40,970
Like, I...

1141
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:45,470
His arm is the size of his fucking head.

1142
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:46,050
I can't.

1143
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:50,930
I'm gonna beat the alcoholic.

1144
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:01,900
Alright, let's go.

1145
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:05,620
He has them genes.

1146
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:06,580
Oh yeah, that's right.

1147
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:08,200
I learned how to do this.

1148
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:10,420
Boom!

1149
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:11,000
Oh.

1150
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,200
Wait, is he just gonna let me do that?

1151
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:15,880
Oh, it's another tutorial?

1152
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,540
I just got back from my tutorial.

1153
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:20,840
Oh yeah?

1154
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:24,180
Boom, I broke your guard.

1155
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:25,100
That's right.

1156
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:27,680
That's right.

1157
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:28,920
Oh man.

1158
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,660
Tutorial 2.

1159
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:43,520
Is he a wooden sword?

1160
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:44,980
Why is my sword so rusty?

1161
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:47,660
Okay.

1162
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:49,640
What's this?

1163
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:50,200
Oh wait, no.

1164
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:50,620
I beat.

1165
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:51,240
Okay.

1166
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:53,680
And then, Falcon Fury.

1167
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:56,220
Bonus art consumes bravery.

1168
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:58,340
Increases as you attack enemies.

1169
01:28:58,540 --> 01:28:58,860
Okay.

1170
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,620
So I just get more...

1171
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:05,240
Alright, let me get more bravery real quick.

1172
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:06,860
That's fucking right.

1173
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:07,680
Oh yeah?

1174
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,780
If I'm weak, why am I just hitting you?

1175
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:13,760
Jungfei.

1176
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:15,500
That's enough for today, don't you think?

1177
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:16,900
Yeah.

1178
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,820
Yeah, are you done getting your ass kicked?

1179
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:20,900
That's fucking right.

1180
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:25,500
Oh yeah?

1181
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,220
I have a block button.

1182
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:28,360
What you gonna do?

1183
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,820
That's fucking right.

1184
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:30,480
Get blocked.

1185
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,140
Get blocked.

1186
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:34,100
Oh, get blocked again.

1187
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:35,620
That's right.

1188
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,140
What else am I gonna do next?

1189
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,200
Am I gonna block?

1190
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:39,820
That's fucking right.

1191
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:40,660
Alright.

1192
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:42,880
Wait, what?

1193
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:44,040
Oh, nice.

1194
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:44,380
Okay.

1195
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:47,140
Wait, what?

1196
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:50,280
I blocked.

1197
01:29:50,780 --> 01:29:51,040
Oh.

1198
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:52,620
Oh!

1199
01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:55,100
It's like Dark Souls!

1200
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:59,440
Guys, I'm never gonna use that.

1201
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,160
You know that, right?

1202
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:02,840
Parry.

1203
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:04,080
What the fuck is that?

1204
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:05,940
Very vague.

1205
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:06,100
Very vague.

1206
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,660
Alright, nice.

1207
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:11,980
Alright, come on.

1208
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:12,760
Do your thing again.

1209
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:14,580
That's right.

1210
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:16,720
I don't even have to time it.

1211
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:17,620
I can just spam it.

1212
01:30:22,210 --> 01:30:23,290
Come on.

1213
01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:24,870
I don't need a tutorial.

1214
01:30:25,030 --> 01:30:25,950
Let me beat him up.

1215
01:30:26,950 --> 01:30:27,850
Oh shit.

1216
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:29,350
Oh shit.

1217
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:33,210
Never mind.

1218
01:30:33,210 --> 01:30:33,250
Never mind.

1219
01:30:35,450 --> 01:30:37,190
Okay, now I can.

1220
01:30:39,950 --> 01:30:41,090
Alright, nice.

1221
01:30:45,410 --> 01:30:46,530
That's fucking right.

1222
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:48,490
Defeat John Fae.

1223
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:49,450
Oh, I got this.

1224
01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:51,090
I got this now.

1225
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:53,670
Oh.

1226
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:55,070
What?

1227
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:55,370
Fuck!

1228
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:55,710
Okay.

1229
01:30:56,930 --> 01:30:57,410
What?

1230
01:30:57,530 --> 01:30:58,490
He gets to do that?

1231
01:30:58,730 --> 01:30:59,490
That should be illegal.

1232
01:30:59,910 --> 01:31:00,510
Oh shit.

1233
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:01,250
I already learned.

1234
01:31:01,310 --> 01:31:02,310
I forgot how to...

1235
01:31:02,310 --> 01:31:02,690
Oh!

1236
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:04,430
I forgot everything.

1237
01:31:04,950 --> 01:31:05,450
That's okay.

1238
01:31:09,610 --> 01:31:10,210
Okay.

1239
01:31:12,470 --> 01:31:13,210
That's fucking right.

1240
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:16,470
That's right.

1241
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:20,670
Come on.

1242
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:22,570
Wait.

1243
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:25,390
He was shielding this entire time?

1244
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:27,550
What do you mean he was shielding this entire...

1245
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:28,210
Oh, wait.

1246
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:29,550
How did I do that?

1247
01:31:31,990 --> 01:31:32,490
Don't!

1248
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:34,410
I wasted it.

1249
01:31:37,770 --> 01:31:39,430
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1250
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:40,650
No, no, no, no, no.

1251
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:45,980
What?

1252
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:49,640
What kind of move is that?

1253
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,280
Oh my god.

1254
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:51,960
That's bullshit.

1255
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:54,060
That's actually bullshit.

1256
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:04,000
That's not fair.

1257
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:06,420
He uses Musou.

1258
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:07,120
That's cheating.

1259
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:08,960
That's actually cheating.

1260
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:12,220
I can't believe he uses Musou.

1261
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:14,580
This is a 1v...

1262
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:16,380
This is Final Destination.

1263
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:17,200
No Musou.

1264
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,540
No items.

1265
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:20,360
No Musou.

1266
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:23,840
No mantas.

1267
01:32:41,230 --> 01:32:43,390
No items.

1268
01:32:43,770 --> 01:32:44,610
No items.

1269
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:44,830
No mantas.

1270
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:45,610
No Musou.

1271
01:32:47,030 --> 01:32:48,970
Final Destination.

1272
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:59,230
No Musou Lupu only.

1273
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:03,390
Why?

1274
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:05,350
Why is Lupe so hot?

1275
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:07,850
Is that the only thing he has for him?

1276
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:08,790
Other than benevolence?

1277
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:24,130
But...

1278
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:25,190
He's so hot.

1279
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:27,690
They're all so hot.

1280
01:33:33,670 --> 01:33:35,430
We'll know when we see...

1281
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:36,090
We'll know when we see...

1282
01:33:36,090 --> 01:33:36,690
Cow-Cow.

1283
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:47,170
We must stop...

1284
01:33:48,230 --> 01:33:50,110
We must stop them.

1285
01:33:51,990 --> 01:33:55,770
If everyone is hot, Then no one is.

1286
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:57,250
Someone's like.

1287
01:33:57,670 --> 01:34:00,510
Oh, Cow-Cow is pretty hot.

1288
01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:03,650
Someone... Oh, man!

1289
01:34:04,030 --> 01:34:05,690
What did they do to him?

1290
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:11,170
What did they do to KaoKao?

1291
01:34:11,670 --> 01:34:12,710
Oh, man!

1292
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:14,850
Unlock.

1293
01:34:15,470 --> 01:34:16,210
What is this?

1294
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:19,310
I played the demo.

1295
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:25,910
Oh, oh, it's fast travel.

1296
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:26,110
Hello.

1297
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:32,300
Alright, time... Alright, maybe we'll see you in here.

1298
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:41,080
I can't.

1299
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:41,540
I can't.

1300
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:43,420
I can't take Lupe, seriously.

1301
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:47,840
Like, even the last game, he still looked a little older.

1302
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:51,200
Like, at this one, he's like... He's like a child.

1303
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:52,660
He's like a teenager.

1304
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:55,120
I've made my decision.

1305
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,180
I won't build up tension, guys.

1306
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:16,160
That's me.

1307
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:17,320
I'm part of the team!

1308
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:18,600
I'm part of the gang!

1309
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,160
Now, there's four.

1310
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:25,900
History says there were three, but there was actually four.

1311
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:27,680
Oh, cool!

1312
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:35,000
Oh,

1313
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:40,400
this is how I play Dynasty Warriors.

1314
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:43,000
It might not be, like, super fun for some people.

1315
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:47,200
But I literally bone rush into, like, the generals, kill them, and then go next.

1316
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:56,400
Not the main general, but I kill every mini-boss, every of the small generals, and then I go straight for him.

1317
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:59,120
Like, I don't even care about the little guys.

1318
01:36:23,530 --> 01:36:25,550
Help people who need it most.

1319
01:36:26,610 --> 01:36:30,950
You know, some people actually fight the non-bosses.

1320
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:32,930
Like, the mini-guys.

1321
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:36,370
That, you know, like the red over here that blocks everything.

1322
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:38,090
Some people actually fight those.

1323
01:36:38,290 --> 01:36:38,850
I don't.

1324
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:39,930
I just go...

1325
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:40,950
Kill this guy.

1326
01:36:41,570 --> 01:36:42,350
Kill him.

1327
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:43,350
Kill him.

1328
01:36:43,490 --> 01:36:43,850
And then...

1329
01:36:44,290 --> 01:36:45,030
And then go him.

1330
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:51,850
I, like, ignore all these.

1331
01:36:51,910 --> 01:36:54,790
I just run- I ride my horse straight through all these guys.

1332
01:36:57,930 --> 01:36:59,350
Yeah, I'm a long mower.

1333
01:36:59,690 --> 01:37:00,790
Okay, war council.

1334
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:03,550
Battle preparation begin battle.

1335
01:37:05,310 --> 01:37:06,270
Alright, I'm ready.

1336
01:37:11,610 --> 01:37:12,130
Exactly!

1337
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:13,870
Fodder fights fodder!

1338
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:18,310
I don't need to waste my time on these little people.

1339
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:21,310
They are irrelevant to me.

1340
01:37:44,550 --> 01:37:48,550
And nothing bad is ever gonna happen to us.

1341
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:53,070
And we will all grow old and die together.

1342
01:37:53,390 --> 01:37:54,250
Right, brothers?

1343
01:38:01,790 --> 01:38:03,430
Right, guys?

1344
01:38:05,690 --> 01:38:09,970
We're all gonna get our happily ever after.

1345
01:38:12,730 --> 01:38:13,650
So specific.

1346
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:15,770
Wait, what?

1347
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:19,090
Oh my god, who the fuck was- Oh, it's Guan Yun.

1348
01:38:19,190 --> 01:38:19,990
Of course, nevermind.

1349
01:38:22,870 --> 01:38:25,190
Oh, he did- He did the pose!

1350
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:27,890
Guys, did you see that?

1351
01:38:28,530 --> 01:38:30,650
He did the Guan Yun pose!

1352
01:38:31,390 --> 01:38:34,070
I like how he's- Wait, why is he bigger?

1353
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:35,970
Guys!

1354
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:37,510
Guys!

1355
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:41,730
Why is he bigger than them?

1356
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:46,010
Oh my god!

1357
01:38:46,610 --> 01:38:48,730
To be a general, you must be six feet.

1358
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:55,530
You must- You are just short.

1359
01:38:57,530 --> 01:38:59,270
I feel like- Oh shit.

1360
01:38:59,770 --> 01:39:07,150
Oh fuck, I need a- I actually need a- Okay, I'm gonna start- I'm actually gonna start blocking too.

1361
01:39:08,270 --> 01:39:08,910
Come on.

1362
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:11,230
That's fucking right.

1363
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:17,310
I'm gonna ki- Wait, I already killed him.

1364
01:39:18,610 --> 01:39:19,090
It's fine.

1365
01:39:20,110 --> 01:39:20,510
Oh no.

1366
01:39:21,130 --> 01:39:25,590
I don't need to fucking evade when you're already dead!

1367
01:39:27,790 --> 01:39:32,330
Mu- Mu Yang Yi is advanced- Okay, I need to find some bows.

1368
01:39:32,330 --> 01:39:36,490
Is there any mantas?

1369
01:39:39,190 --> 01:39:41,330
Are now advancing to the yellow- Oh my god.

1370
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:42,010
Oh my god.

1371
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:42,510
Oh my god.

1372
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:43,530
They're all running for him.

1373
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:45,150
They're all running for him.

1374
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:48,590
Yeah, the classic dialogue delay.

1375
01:39:49,970 --> 01:39:53,010
That's how- Like, why is he so big?

1376
01:39:57,090 --> 01:40:01,670
I love how- I love how fucking big they are.

1377
01:40:01,670 --> 01:40:07,170
It's like actually- In order to be a general, it's a height requirement.

1378
01:40:09,850 --> 01:40:11,050
That's fucked up.

1379
01:40:12,690 --> 01:40:14,630
Pressing- I don't need- I don't need to use it.

1380
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:16,010
He's too, like, small.

1381
01:40:16,490 --> 01:40:18,890
He's too much of a small fry for me to use it.

1382
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:20,490
That's fucking right.

1383
01:40:22,210 --> 01:40:27,150
The secret yells at you must be this tall to be a general.

1384
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:33,090
The fe- Where's the jars?

1385
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:34,890
I need- I need bread.

1386
01:40:37,330 --> 01:40:38,430
I'm gonna steal it.

1387
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:39,030
Kill steal!

1388
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:42,550
Oh, I have it!

1389
01:40:42,590 --> 01:40:43,430
Oh, it's over here!

1390
01:40:43,610 --> 01:40:46,150
Okay, meat buns can be found inside the pots.

1391
01:40:46,910 --> 01:40:47,490
Don't worry.

1392
01:40:47,890 --> 01:40:48,650
Kill steal!

1393
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:50,450
Nice.

1394
01:40:50,910 --> 01:40:51,610
I did it.

1395
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:54,530
He eats good food.

1396
01:40:54,650 --> 01:40:56,630
That's why he's bigger.

1397
01:40:56,630 --> 01:40:59,110
I need to find pots, though.

1398
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:02,430
Wait, where?

1399
01:41:05,850 --> 01:41:07,730
One step closer to victory.

1400
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:09,070
I'm coming over.

1401
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:12,390
Oh my god, he's a magician!

1402
01:41:13,730 --> 01:41:14,410
That's for work.

1403
01:41:14,450 --> 01:41:14,790
Get out!

1404
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:16,510
No magic allowed!

1405
01:41:16,610 --> 01:41:17,830
Only sword fights!

1406
01:41:18,670 --> 01:41:19,450
That's right!

1407
01:41:20,070 --> 01:41:22,570
You're trying to use filthy magic?

1408
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,370
Okay, nice.

1409
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:27,570
Where am I?

1410
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:29,830
Oh god, I have to climb the ladder.

1411
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:31,330
Guys, give me a sec.

1412
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:33,010
I gotta climb the ladder.

1413
01:41:33,490 --> 01:41:34,930
I flew too far.

1414
01:41:35,330 --> 01:41:36,270
Oh shit.

1415
01:41:38,150 --> 01:41:40,110
Oh no, that's not who I wanted.

1416
01:41:41,570 --> 01:41:42,990
I flew too far.

1417
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:49,190
Bring a fan into us or get out of here.

1418
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:49,770
No!

1419
01:41:50,410 --> 01:41:52,890
The volunteer soldier killed him!

1420
01:41:53,430 --> 01:41:55,810
I did all the work!

1421
01:41:57,430 --> 01:42:01,500
I can't believe a regular guy killed him.

1422
01:42:03,270 --> 01:42:06,130
And it didn't even matter.

1423
01:42:07,070 --> 01:42:08,450
Wait, I gotta help him.

1424
01:42:08,650 --> 01:42:10,390
I'm gonna get more general kills.

1425
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:12,710
Don't worry.

1426
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:14,410
It's He-Man!

1427
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:16,670
Don't worry, I'm gonna kill He-Man.

1428
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:21,690
Okay.

1429
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:23,910
Oh shit.

1430
01:42:24,630 --> 01:42:26,310
That's alright, I blocked it.

1431
01:42:26,670 --> 01:42:27,830
I fucking blocked it.

1432
01:42:28,830 --> 01:42:29,550
It's fine.

1433
01:42:30,950 --> 01:42:31,590
Oh, no!

1434
01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:32,410
No, no, no, no!

1435
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:37,510
He-Man, what is he doing here?

1436
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:40,370
Okay, I gotta do this.

1437
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:42,810
I need to remember how to dodge.

1438
01:42:44,370 --> 01:42:45,130
Alright, I'm brutal.

1439
01:42:45,310 --> 01:42:45,610
Struggle?

1440
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:45,910
Where?

1441
01:42:46,050 --> 01:42:46,510
Oh no!

1442
01:42:46,770 --> 01:42:46,990
Oh no!

1443
01:42:47,150 --> 01:42:47,590
No, no, no!

1444
01:42:47,590 --> 01:42:48,970
I got a bun!

1445
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:50,270
No, no, no, no!

1446
01:42:50,650 --> 01:42:51,430
It's not fair!

1447
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:52,730
He has a giant hammer!

1448
01:42:53,370 --> 01:42:54,610
I just have a sword!

1449
01:42:55,890 --> 01:42:57,030
Okay, he should be dead.

1450
01:42:58,570 --> 01:43:01,590
One of my favorite characters, He-Man.

1451
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:03,610
I need to find more pots.

1452
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:06,630
I swear, I haven't found a single pot.

1453
01:43:07,230 --> 01:43:08,570
Don't worry, I saved you.

1454
01:43:08,630 --> 01:43:09,290
Oh, there it is.

1455
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:12,050
I need to keep Dario.

1456
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:13,090
We got two buns.

1457
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:15,570
Open the door.

1458
01:43:16,630 --> 01:43:17,630
Alright, guys.

1459
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:19,290
Open the door!

1460
01:43:22,170 --> 01:43:24,690
Or we could go the other side, to be fair.

1461
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:26,170
I could just climb this ladder.

1462
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:27,170
I think it would be faster.

1463
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:31,570
I think it would be...

1464
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:34,250
Wait, you're right!

1465
01:43:34,310 --> 01:43:36,330
The soldiers actually stay on the ground.

1466
01:43:37,470 --> 01:43:39,150
You're right, I just noticed that.

1467
01:43:39,150 --> 01:43:40,750
What are you talking about?

1468
01:43:41,910 --> 01:43:43,830
Who exactly are you trying to save?

1469
01:43:44,270 --> 01:43:45,090
Wait, there's two of them.

1470
01:43:45,370 --> 01:43:46,010
Wait a minute.

1471
01:43:46,570 --> 01:43:51,510
Oh my god, I'm learning how to dodge!

1472
01:43:53,550 --> 01:43:55,310
No, I didn't mean to use my musou!

1473
01:43:56,610 --> 01:43:57,650
Okay, that's fine.

1474
01:43:58,330 --> 01:44:00,590
That's fine, I don't need it to kill the big man.

1475
01:44:03,810 --> 01:44:08,490
You guys, you guys open the door while I go the other way.

1476
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:11,190
Making them a force to be reckoned with.

1477
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:14,190
Soldiers of high courage will perform group attacks using tactics?

1478
01:44:14,630 --> 01:44:17,210
They're gonna use strategy against me?

1479
01:44:19,350 --> 01:44:22,710
Cannot be blocked and can only be stopped with special arts.

1480
01:44:23,870 --> 01:44:24,830
Special arts?

1481
01:44:25,130 --> 01:44:27,570
Holy shit, he's fucking huge!

1482
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:32,410
What the fuck?

1483
01:44:32,530 --> 01:44:34,570
He's bigger than the regular generals!

1484
01:44:36,850 --> 01:44:38,730
What is wrong with him?

1485
01:44:41,490 --> 01:44:42,870
Holy shit!

1486
01:44:43,570 --> 01:44:45,370
Oh my god!

1487
01:44:46,090 --> 01:44:48,430
Bro, what are they feeding him?

1488
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:52,610
Oh my god!

1489
01:44:53,130 --> 01:44:56,350
What are they feeding these generals?

1490
01:44:57,770 --> 01:44:59,790
Simply fed better.

1491
01:45:02,910 --> 01:45:04,270
Other villagers?

1492
01:45:04,890 --> 01:45:06,070
Bro, this man is 7 feet.

1493
01:45:06,310 --> 01:45:08,490
He's not even 6 feet anymore.

1494
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:13,550
They stole all the food.

1495
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:20,330
That's fucking right.

1496
01:45:22,910 --> 01:45:24,810
Don't worry, I've gotten you in here too.

1497
01:45:25,190 --> 01:45:26,030
Oh shit!

1498
01:45:26,310 --> 01:45:27,010
Get parried!

1499
01:45:27,650 --> 01:45:28,970
Get fucking parried!

1500
01:45:28,970 --> 01:45:30,130
Oh!

1501
01:45:33,970 --> 01:45:35,750
Ending it right now.

1502
01:45:36,530 --> 01:45:39,570
That's why the people are starving.

1503
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:46,150
Cinema.

1504
01:45:52,730 --> 01:46:01,070
We're too early for the NBA.

1505
01:46:01,830 --> 01:46:04,790
We're just in time to become a general.

1506
01:46:05,410 --> 01:46:07,650
No wonder they are starving.

1507
01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:13,350
Yay!

1508
01:46:13,850 --> 01:46:15,590
Oh, I can upgrade my sword.

1509
01:46:16,090 --> 01:46:16,130
I'm gonna upgrade my sword.

1510
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:22,390
I guess the more I kill, the stronger I become.

1511
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:25,690
The more skills I unlock.

1512
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:29,210
Wait, what does that mean?

1513
01:46:29,530 --> 01:46:31,070
That's not controller.

1514
01:46:31,730 --> 01:46:33,810
That's not... Okay, it's X.

1515
01:46:34,130 --> 01:46:36,210
Guys, oh my god.

1516
01:46:36,470 --> 01:46:37,790
That's a really hard combo.

1517
01:46:40,910 --> 01:46:42,070
Oh my god, guys.

1518
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:43,270
Do you think I can do this combo?

1519
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:46,650
X, X, X, X, X, X.

1520
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:47,490
Damn.

1521
01:46:48,330 --> 01:46:49,930
I don't know, man.

1522
01:46:50,930 --> 01:46:52,270
Feels a little difficult.

1523
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:55,510
No.

1524
01:46:55,990 --> 01:46:58,110
You're right, I might have to practice.

1525
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:06,090
God, they innovated so much from the original game.

1526
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:07,430
Oh my god.

1527
01:47:07,730 --> 01:47:11,690
I can't believe they added an extra X to our combo.

1528
01:47:11,690 --> 01:47:13,690
Oh my god.

1529
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:18,930
Innovation right there.

1530
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:30,030
Yuan Shao?

1531
01:47:32,530 --> 01:47:34,170
Oh, Lu Xia... No, not Lu Xia.

1532
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:36,190
The other Lu.

1533
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:40,750
Oh my god, Jonathan.

1534
01:47:40,870 --> 01:47:41,870
You always want to drink.

1535
01:47:42,030 --> 01:47:43,950
How is this a celebration of you're always drinking?

1536
01:47:45,290 --> 01:47:46,150
Yeah, Lu Yang.

1537
01:48:01,470 --> 01:48:04,110
This one's a little bit more special, Doki.

1538
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:13,540
Alright, let's enable Zhang Fei's alcohol problem.

1539
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:17,100
Winning a battle and quelling the chaos will increase the province's level of peace.

1540
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:20,060
Raising priests to high levels brings many benefits.

1541
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:21,940
Ooh, peace has risen!

1542
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:23,980
Nice!

1543
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:29,620
Toggle and break to get access to more precise information.

1544
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:31,440
Use it to find objectives.

1545
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:32,700
Yeah?

1546
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:34,740
Oh, so...

1547
01:48:34,740 --> 01:48:37,280
It just says G.

1548
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:39,320
That's it.

1549
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,520
That's my extra information.

1550
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:43,840
So extra.

1551
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:51,060
Do I just go... Oh, what's this though?

1552
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:53,040
Oh nice, I found money!

1553
01:48:55,340 --> 01:48:55,720
Alright.

1554
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:55,880
Alright.

1555
01:49:02,180 --> 01:49:04,040
Back home!

1556
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:19,020
I have a magic talisman.

1557
01:49:20,660 --> 01:49:21,940
Who are you?

1558
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:41,760
At the moment, that light represents the hopes of the people.

1559
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:52,860
Hope provides people with the will to live, and with that determination, they can change the world.

1560
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:59,900
Eventually, this cycle will guide the realm toward peace.

1561
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:06,480
I believe this is also connected to your forgotten past.

1562
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:14,200
That is the very reason why you were entrusted with bringing about an age of peace.

1563
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:14,800
Me?

1564
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:16,980
I'm gonna unite the three kingdoms?

1565
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:24,000
In the end, you will even regain your memories of me in this form.

1566
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:26,040
Who are you, little boy?

1567
01:50:26,660 --> 01:50:28,140
Who are you?

1568
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:33,180
It is time for you to go.

1569
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:38,420
Your true journey has now begun.

1570
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:39,780
There's no fucking way!

1571
01:50:39,900 --> 01:50:41,840
He's supposed to be old!

1572
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:46,520
Why is he a little boy?!

1573
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:49,540
Ah, I didn't know you had returned.

1574
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:51,340
There's no way.

1575
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:53,680
It can't be.

1576
01:50:58,290 --> 01:51:00,350
Oh, I just forgot to take my meds.

1577
01:51:00,370 --> 01:51:00,750
Are you okay?

1578
01:51:01,110 --> 01:51:02,130
You seem a little dazed.

1579
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:05,430
I suppose you must be tired.

1580
01:51:06,170 --> 01:51:08,210
Sorry, I just forgot to take my meds again.

1581
01:51:08,610 --> 01:51:11,590
We've just purchased quality incense from the herb shop.

1582
01:51:11,590 --> 01:51:12,650
Oh, oh no, never mind.

1583
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:17,350
It might be the incen- Sorry, it might- No, you know what?

1584
01:51:17,390 --> 01:51:18,610
No, it's definitely the incense.

1585
01:51:18,830 --> 01:51:20,430
I think there's something extra in there.

1586
01:51:21,990 --> 01:51:23,210
Ah, I'm sorry.

1587
01:51:23,210 --> 01:51:25,430
Oh, that explains it.

1588
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:39,800
Alright, do I have any new letters?

1589
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:42,820
Greetings, NotDoki.

1590
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,660
This is my first letter to you.

1591
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:47,480
I'm a volunteer soldier who- Oh, guys!

1592
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:50,720
I have someone who has a crush on me!

1593
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:53,960
And I was saved by your actions.

1594
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:57,000
To be honest, I thought of you as a distant and tribal individual.

1595
01:51:57,480 --> 01:52:01,260
But now I wish to hate myself for being- Oh my god, my first fan mail!

1596
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:03,900
Guys, my first fan mail in my P.O.

1597
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:04,360
box!

1598
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:09,700
I saw you throw that enemy soldier who had me cornered right into the air.

1599
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:13,320
And skip through the battlefield from one end to the other to help my comrades.

1600
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:17,560
At that moment, I realized what an incredible officer you will become.

1601
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:21,140
And how your renown will grow amid these dark times.

1602
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:24,840
This is a gift, a small token of gratitude from this unnamed soldier.

1603
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:27,620
I hope- Oh my god, the first dragoon.

1604
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:29,260
Guys, we're doing it.

1605
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,200
The very first dragoon.

1606
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:36,520
Alright, uh... Do I need battle preparation anything?

1607
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:37,760
Do I have anything?

1608
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:40,160
No, I don't.

1609
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:40,560
Okay.

1610
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:42,240
Uh...

1611
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:44,360
Oh, hey, it's plus two.

1612
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:45,960
I like that.

1613
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:47,240
It has a two on there.

1614
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:49,200
It makes it stronger.

1615
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:52,120
The first- The very first- Your ancestor.

1616
01:52:57,740 --> 01:53:00,380
You mean- Alright, John Fae, what do you want?

1617
01:53:09,030 --> 01:53:11,790
That was basically a super chat.

1618
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:14,070
Thank you for the super chat, unnamed soldier.

1619
01:53:14,230 --> 01:53:15,270
Thank you, thank you.

1620
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:17,210
Hey, Dookie.

1621
01:53:17,450 --> 01:53:18,030
Hey, not Dookie.

1622
01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:19,050
Sorry, hey, not Dookie.

1623
01:53:26,790 --> 01:53:28,010
What?

1624
01:53:30,010 --> 01:53:39,630
I mean, look at his beard.

1625
01:53:47,050 --> 01:53:53,110
You've only just heard- Jesus Christ, I'm so rude.

1626
01:53:53,110 --> 01:53:58,250
And that's how I'm gonna- And that's how I'm gonna make it.

1627
01:54:08,010 --> 01:54:12,970
It's weird listening to John Fae not have a super raspy voice.

1628
01:54:42,090 --> 01:54:46,270
They literally just met and was like, we have so much in common, let's be brothers.

1629
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:04,710
I've always wanted a brother.

1630
01:55:08,570 --> 01:55:11,890
Don't worry, history will never make fun of you.

1631
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:17,930
Stop!

1632
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:23,670
Oh no.

1633
01:55:26,810 --> 01:55:29,930
This is how dude friendships work.

1634
01:55:31,530 --> 01:55:32,630
Hey, I love fighting.

1635
01:55:32,830 --> 01:55:33,970
I love fighting, too.

1636
01:55:34,290 --> 01:55:38,270
Oh my God, samsies, let's be sworn brothers forever.

1637
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:45,630
Not real.

1638
01:55:53,510 --> 01:55:55,190
Did we just became sworn brothers?

1639
01:55:55,410 --> 01:55:58,430
No need for compli- You're not being very clear.

1640
01:55:58,550 --> 01:56:01,030
Why is both my options so fucking bad?

1641
01:56:01,030 --> 01:56:07,010
Like, they're so bad.

1642
01:56:07,570 --> 01:56:11,350
Like, they're both like, fuck off.

1643
01:56:12,370 --> 01:56:25,050
Like, no need for compliments, you're not being- Get this damn bread.

1644
01:56:28,750 --> 01:56:32,230
I'm sorry, the other option was just as bad.

1645
01:56:32,850 --> 01:56:36,250
It was just as bad, John Fae.

1646
01:56:42,770 --> 01:56:44,550
That's why no one talks about you.

1647
01:56:45,010 --> 01:56:48,330
This is why they wrote me out of history, guys.

1648
01:56:49,090 --> 01:56:51,270
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

1649
01:56:51,530 --> 01:56:51,610
Thank you.

1650
01:56:51,610 --> 01:56:55,790
I was such an asshole that they literally just wrote me out of history.

1651
01:56:58,710 --> 01:57:01,110
I just ceased to exist.

1652
01:57:01,930 --> 01:57:04,210
Because I was hated by everyone.

1653
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:15,720
Alright, there are weapon shops, inns, and other collect- locations for you to make use of.

1654
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:16,640
Alright.

1655
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:18,360
Like here?

1656
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:23,920
When I went to G, it literally said nothing about that.

1657
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:27,400
How do I get out of here?

1658
01:57:28,860 --> 01:57:31,360
The first time I met my best friend, we just...

1659
01:57:33,820 --> 01:57:34,860
We... What?

1660
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:36,740
The crap of each other and we hang- Oh.

1661
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:38,020
What?

1662
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:43,380
We fu- Wait, what is JCK?

1663
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:46,020
The crap of each other and we hanged out after that.

1664
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:46,620
What?

1665
01:57:46,860 --> 01:57:48,380
Thank you for the super chat.

1666
01:57:48,460 --> 01:57:48,760
Thank you.

1667
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:49,340
Thank you.

1668
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:50,620
Oh, there's the weapon shop.

1669
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:52,440
You what?

1670
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:56,820
Zion, which weapon is right for you?

1671
01:57:56,860 --> 01:57:58,080
Well, I can only buy one.

1672
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:03,760
Your MC was dropped on the head as a baby.

1673
01:58:03,860 --> 01:58:07,280
They're clearly- I don't want.

1674
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:09,220
Cholo, thank you for the super chat.

1675
01:58:09,300 --> 01:58:09,720
Thank you.

1676
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:10,180
Thank you.

1677
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:12,140
Yes, I wanna equip it.

1678
01:58:16,790 --> 01:58:18,610
Now I can use a sphere.

1679
01:58:20,130 --> 01:58:22,730
I should have a longer range now.

1680
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:28,690
Meet Nadoki, the man who unite the three kingdoms to a common hate for him.

1681
01:58:29,430 --> 01:58:29,850
For him.

1682
01:58:30,170 --> 01:58:31,650
Thank you for the super chat, Raging.

1683
01:58:31,790 --> 01:58:32,090
Thank you.

1684
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:32,870
Thank you.

1685
01:58:34,330 --> 01:58:35,970
I think I wanna use the sphere.

1686
01:58:36,230 --> 01:58:38,150
Just cause it's like, the range is longer.

1687
01:58:41,250 --> 01:58:42,930
Got the sphere now.

1688
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:50,180
We got some time to kill until Liu Bei returns.

1689
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:51,480
You can have some fun with those.

1690
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:54,140
There are yellow turbans, remnants all over the place.

1691
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:55,780
Why not go and take them on?

1692
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:57,780
I'm gonna teach you how to use that.

1693
01:58:57,860 --> 01:58:58,840
It's all on the wrist.

1694
01:58:59,000 --> 01:58:59,420
You'll see.

1695
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:00,840
Just give it a try.

1696
01:59:01,860 --> 01:59:03,180
What skirmish has broke out?

1697
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:05,720
It can be concluded in a short period of time.

1698
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:07,560
Skirmishes make for great practices.

1699
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:09,260
Uh, okay, sure.

1700
01:59:14,390 --> 01:59:15,190
I'm sorry.

1701
01:59:15,850 --> 01:59:17,970
I keep forgetting to move my cursor.

1702
01:59:17,970 --> 01:59:20,210
Beat the crap out of each other.

1703
01:59:20,230 --> 01:59:22,790
I didn't read it properly.

1704
01:59:23,110 --> 01:59:23,970
It's okay.

1705
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:26,330
I was like, whoa!

1706
01:59:27,510 --> 01:59:33,130
That is one very unfortunate typo you got there.

1707
01:59:34,490 --> 01:59:37,170
Oh, Warren, thank you for the super chat.

1708
01:59:37,330 --> 01:59:37,650
Thank you.

1709
01:59:38,030 --> 01:59:38,410
Thank you.

1710
01:59:38,890 --> 01:59:41,390
I was like, whoa there, Warren.

1711
01:59:43,850 --> 01:59:45,390
Sure, Warren.

1712
01:59:45,690 --> 01:59:46,190
Sure.

1713
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:48,310
Typo.

1714
01:59:52,950 --> 01:59:54,130
Alright, where's the general?

1715
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:56,450
Where's the six foot man?

1716
01:59:58,230 --> 01:59:59,390
Oh, there you are.

1717
01:59:59,490 --> 01:59:59,950
I see you.

1718
02:00:00,010 --> 02:00:00,990
I'm coming for you.

1719
02:00:01,110 --> 02:00:03,670
Holy shit, he's fucking huge!

1720
02:00:06,330 --> 02:00:07,550
There he is!

1721
02:00:09,950 --> 02:00:11,230
Alright, that's fine.

1722
02:00:13,190 --> 02:00:15,030
I'm gonna use the new combo I learned.

1723
02:00:15,390 --> 02:00:21,770
It's X, and then- It's X, and then X, and then X, and then- Oh wait, an extra Y.

1724
02:00:25,770 --> 02:00:27,390
The absolute unit.

1725
02:00:30,150 --> 02:00:35,310
Yeah, I was gonna say, this looks like Dao Yun's moveset right there.

1726
02:00:35,470 --> 02:00:37,270
Cause he uses a spear too.

1727
02:00:39,810 --> 02:00:40,350
Yeah!

1728
02:00:41,070 --> 02:00:43,070
What combo did I- Okay, that's also X.

1729
02:00:43,350 --> 02:00:46,230
Oh, so like each weapon has its own combo.

1730
02:00:46,630 --> 02:00:47,250
I see.

1731
02:00:49,010 --> 02:00:51,270
Might as well just use- Yeah, I'll upgrade the spear.

1732
02:00:54,730 --> 02:00:55,270
Okay.

1733
02:00:56,770 --> 02:00:57,850
Reaching- Oh!

1734
02:00:58,170 --> 02:00:59,400
There's skill panels?

1735
02:01:01,350 --> 02:01:04,870
New skills can be learned by spending- You can access- Oh!

1736
02:01:06,770 --> 02:01:07,250
Attack.

1737
02:01:07,790 --> 02:01:09,770
A good defense is a good attack.

1738
02:01:10,750 --> 02:01:11,990
That's what- That's right.

1739
02:01:13,010 --> 02:01:14,630
And then, boost health.

1740
02:01:15,690 --> 02:01:20,850
Unleashes a swinging kick with baton during that you will disappear and be- Oh wait, I should like that.

1741
02:01:21,590 --> 02:01:22,670
Actually, we'll get this too.

1742
02:01:23,230 --> 02:01:24,110
Oh, I can't.

1743
02:01:24,190 --> 02:01:25,090
It's alright, I'm committed.

1744
02:01:25,690 --> 02:01:26,730
Oh wait, I just don't have points.

1745
02:01:26,790 --> 02:01:27,330
Okay, nevermind.

1746
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:31,150
Exactly.

1747
02:01:31,550 --> 02:01:33,090
The best defense is offense.

1748
02:01:38,350 --> 02:01:39,670
Did I finish it?

1749
02:01:40,150 --> 02:01:41,410
Oh, there's more skirmishes.

1750
02:01:43,330 --> 02:01:45,270
See current skills?

1751
02:01:46,150 --> 02:01:48,790
You can test weapons by using the virtual battlefield.

1752
02:01:49,550 --> 02:01:50,110
Okay.

1753
02:01:54,730 --> 02:01:59,790
Alright, we gotta go to another skirmish.

1754
02:01:59,790 --> 02:02:02,170
Yeah, there's like a training room now too.

1755
02:02:02,530 --> 02:02:06,270
I'm really enjoying the new- I'm really enjoying this game actually.

1756
02:02:07,190 --> 02:02:08,850
It's actually- It's really fun.

1757
02:02:08,970 --> 02:02:19,510
It's like- It's such a- I will say I do miss like- I wish I could play like the other- The other general?

1758
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:20,730
The other characters?

1759
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:25,150
But like I understand they want to make this more of a story focused game.

1760
02:02:25,870 --> 02:02:30,310
But I do miss being able to play different kingdoms and stuff.

1761
02:02:30,850 --> 02:02:31,750
Oh, I got a long sword.

1762
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:32,890
Wait, there's a different one?

1763
02:02:33,150 --> 02:02:34,990
Oh my god, he's also a fucking unit.

1764
02:02:36,230 --> 02:02:36,990
Oh shit.

1765
02:02:37,970 --> 02:02:38,270
Parried.

1766
02:02:39,030 --> 02:02:40,150
That's right, get parried.

1767
02:02:40,150 --> 02:02:42,550
This is definitely new.

1768
02:02:43,230 --> 02:02:53,030
Like a- This is like a new way that- A new way of- What's the word called?

1769
02:02:53,550 --> 02:02:56,750
A new way to tell the story.

1770
02:02:58,710 --> 02:03:01,190
Cause I don't think they've done it before like this.

1771
02:03:06,250 --> 02:03:06,710
Boop.

1772
02:03:08,070 --> 02:03:11,570
Yeah, they've never done it this way before to experience the story.

1773
02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:15,170
Yeah, they definitely changed it up.

1774
02:03:16,830 --> 02:03:18,330
Oh my god, wait, there's another one?

1775
02:03:18,430 --> 02:03:21,950
I didn't even- I was like, who are you?

1776
02:03:22,510 --> 02:03:24,290
I didn't even notice this guy.

1777
02:03:24,550 --> 02:03:26,010
Alright, don't worry, I'm trying out the new combo.

1778
02:03:26,330 --> 02:03:29,210
It's X and then- Oh shit, he did it- Okay, wait.

1779
02:03:29,210 --> 02:03:32,130
It's X- Please, let me use my combo!

1780
02:03:33,210 --> 02:03:34,310
It's not fair.

1781
02:03:34,510 --> 02:03:36,030
I'm trying to use my combo.

1782
02:03:37,550 --> 02:03:38,810
It's not fair.

1783
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:40,490
How would I ever learn?

1784
02:03:41,890 --> 02:03:43,050
Nice, parry.

1785
02:03:48,310 --> 02:03:51,010
I don't even know who you are.

1786
02:03:53,550 --> 02:03:57,070
That combo was too hard for Doki.

1787
02:03:58,910 --> 02:04:02,570
Cause I'm trying to learn my X combo!

1788
02:04:04,330 --> 02:04:07,490
I want like this so I can get this move.

1789
02:04:13,550 --> 02:04:16,230
I'm glad they made it similar to the old ones.

1790
02:04:16,310 --> 02:04:20,870
I didn't like the- How they did the- How they tried to change up the formula.

1791
02:04:21,670 --> 02:04:26,770
With like, the last Dynasty Warrior game formula was so- I didn't like that.

1792
02:04:26,770 --> 02:04:33,550
But for this one, I really liked the way they made it similar to the classic Dynasty Warriors.

1793
02:04:33,910 --> 02:04:35,650
But also a whole new thing.

1794
02:04:37,590 --> 02:04:40,030
Like their own- A different spin to it.

1795
02:04:40,490 --> 02:04:44,430
But I do miss being able to play.

1796
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:51,170
The one thing I really miss is that in the older games, you could play each character.

1797
02:04:51,830 --> 02:04:56,490
And then like, each character has its own unique story to it.

1798
02:04:56,530 --> 02:04:58,110
And you follow their story.

1799
02:04:58,490 --> 02:04:59,570
And that's what I miss.

1800
02:04:59,690 --> 02:05:01,030
I used to love that.

1801
02:05:01,250 --> 02:05:04,290
I used to love the way they did it back then.

1802
02:05:04,630 --> 02:05:09,910
But like, it's interesting that now you're like, a third party experiencing the story.

1803
02:05:14,650 --> 02:05:16,830
So, I say we should call it a day.

1804
02:05:17,310 --> 02:05:19,370
My brother should be back any minute now.

1805
02:05:28,980 --> 02:05:31,540
My favorite was when they did a story per character.

1806
02:05:43,660 --> 02:05:45,960
I miss having a tiger as a pet.

1807
02:05:48,760 --> 02:05:51,620
I miss- I miss having a tiger.

1808
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:06,340
Oh, and riding the elephant.

1809
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:06,780
Yeah.

1810
02:06:14,160 --> 02:06:15,840
But we're poor!

1811
02:06:16,860 --> 02:06:20,980
This is exactly why we're always poor, Guan Yun!

1812
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:25,780
It's not always about honor.

1813
02:06:26,020 --> 02:06:28,080
How would Zhang Fei buy his alcohol?

1814
02:06:46,120 --> 02:06:47,760
You were a great help to us.

1815
02:06:49,380 --> 02:06:50,940
I'm glad we met back there.

1816
02:06:51,140 --> 02:06:52,420
It was an honor.

1817
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:55,700
I'm happy to have helped.

1818
02:06:58,340 --> 02:07:03,540
Oh my god, I'm gonna be the fourth sworn brother and they're not gonna write me out of history!

1819
02:07:05,940 --> 02:07:10,000
Now, everyone will know there were four brothers instead of three.

1820
02:07:10,140 --> 02:07:11,100
Right, guys?

1821
02:07:17,420 --> 02:07:19,880
The hidden fourth brother.

1822
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:29,560
I missed a deadline.

1823
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:32,300
Huh?

1824
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:34,160
What?

1825
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:35,840
Who are you, lady?

1826
02:07:36,380 --> 02:07:37,240
Yeah, who are you?

1827
02:07:47,120 --> 02:07:47,820
Zhuhua?

1828
02:07:56,770 --> 02:07:58,640
Oh my gosh, she's so pretty.

1829
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:11,740
Oh no, she's Chunni!

1830
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:18,060
I wish I could customize my character.

1831
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:22,800
Could you be less cryptic, lady?

1832
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:31,520
You didn't answer my question!

1833
02:08:32,360 --> 02:08:32,560
What?

1834
02:08:36,140 --> 02:08:37,440
She just ignored me!

1835
02:08:46,220 --> 02:08:49,200
You wish to stop him, do you not?

1836
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:54,000
Unfortunately, yeah.

1837
02:08:54,740 --> 02:08:56,440
Unfortunately, yes.

1838
02:08:56,660 --> 02:09:01,420
The Yellow Turbans who rose up for peace have now become the...

1839
02:09:01,420 --> 02:09:03,500
Like, why give me a choice?

1840
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:08,200
I feel like if I picked any, it wouldn't... She would say the same thing.

1841
02:09:09,860 --> 02:09:12,160
So, I have come with advice.

1842
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:14,520
Oh, what's the advice?

1843
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:16,960
The Yellow Turbans use magic from the heavens.

1844
02:09:17,620 --> 02:09:20,420
But their magic is nothing but an illusion.

1845
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:23,360
Oh my god, the magic from the heavens.

1846
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:25,580
They sometimes burn incense nearby to cause hallucinations.

1847
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:26,320
I knew it!

1848
02:09:26,420 --> 02:09:28,300
I knew that boy didn't exist!

1849
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:34,320
I knew he bought the wrong incense.

1850
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:37,240
It is an ability that only you possess.

1851
02:09:37,660 --> 02:09:38,400
Only me?

1852
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:39,840
Am I specialized?

1853
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:41,020
I must go.

1854
02:09:41,980 --> 02:09:43,220
But we will meet again.

1855
02:09:50,720 --> 02:09:51,960
I knew it.

1856
02:09:53,260 --> 02:09:58,160
I fucking knew that the innkeeper bought the wrong incense.

1857
02:10:02,860 --> 02:10:04,200
Alright, let's see.

1858
02:10:04,420 --> 02:10:05,480
Is there anything...

1859
02:10:05,480 --> 02:10:07,060
Oh, I can sell now.

1860
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:08,400
Wait, is there a new...

1861
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:09,560
Recruit spear.

1862
02:10:09,880 --> 02:10:11,520
Boost strong attack.

1863
02:10:12,100 --> 02:10:12,740
Wait...

1864
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:13,820
That's plus 20.

1865
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:14,860
I like that.

1866
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:16,860
Yes, equip please.

1867
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:19,080
And then I can sell my old one.

1868
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:24,240
This is the one I have so I can sell this.

1869
02:10:24,940 --> 02:10:26,720
And then I'll sell this.

1870
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:29,000
Do I have any letters?

1871
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:29,900
Any fan mail?

1872
02:10:30,420 --> 02:10:31,280
Any fan mail?

1873
02:10:31,480 --> 02:10:32,180
Oh shit!

1874
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:35,020
Thank you, NotDoki.

1875
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:38,300
Oh pardon my... Oh my god, I'm building my fan base!

1876
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:40,840
I'm recruiting more dragons!

1877
02:10:42,240 --> 02:10:44,280
We were all certain that we were done for.

1878
02:10:44,380 --> 02:10:47,380
But then you gallantly appeared and put a stop to those villains.

1879
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:51,220
Rumors speak of a mysterious warrior who rushed to the aid.

1880
02:10:51,780 --> 02:10:52,340
Could it be?

1881
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:53,780
No, perhaps I ought not to pry.

1882
02:10:54,100 --> 02:10:56,140
In case, please allow us to thank you for what...

1883
02:10:56,140 --> 02:10:57,900
Thank you for the super chat, Village Chief!

1884
02:10:57,940 --> 02:10:59,020
Thank you, thank you!

1885
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:01,560
Oh, I got a great bird's wing.

1886
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:03,140
Okay, what did John Fae get me?

1887
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:07,040
You were in your room, so I'm leaving... Oh my god, take these off my hands, will you?

1888
02:11:07,320 --> 02:11:08,940
You can use them to refine gems.

1889
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:11,620
An old jeweler lives near my house.

1890
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:16,120
And his age is catching up, so he's hanging up his precious tools for good.

1891
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:22,120
If I knew worthy of inheriting them, I figured someone as handy as you would be able to get the most out of them.

1892
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:26,440
They say that having that old man's gem attached to your weapon can bring good fortune and...

1893
02:11:26,440 --> 02:11:27,920
Did he, like...

1894
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:29,980
Did he give me a diamond?

1895
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:32,440
Whoa, John Fae, whoa!

1896
02:11:34,020 --> 02:11:35,700
Oh my god, whoa!

1897
02:11:39,710 --> 02:11:42,110
He super chats with gems!

1898
02:11:42,870 --> 02:11:43,450
Okay, gems.

1899
02:11:43,730 --> 02:11:45,410
Okay, let's see, what can I create?

1900
02:11:45,410 --> 02:11:48,870
There are five possible types of gems that can be created.

1901
02:11:50,730 --> 02:11:51,030
Okay.

1902
02:11:51,390 --> 02:11:53,350
Oh, I created a vortex gem.

1903
02:11:54,170 --> 02:11:56,850
A gem is a special...

1904
02:11:56,850 --> 02:11:59,930
Uh, my first... Guys, I got my first Akasupa!

1905
02:12:01,550 --> 02:12:02,170
Well equipped.

1906
02:12:02,410 --> 02:12:04,410
Thanks, John Fae, for the Akasupa!

1907
02:12:06,110 --> 02:12:09,670
It will grant special effects to any attacks you perform with a weapon.

1908
02:12:10,190 --> 02:12:14,530
Gems can only be obtained by using Pyroxen to create them.

1909
02:12:14,530 --> 02:12:15,230
Oh, cool.

1910
02:12:16,410 --> 02:12:17,470
But how do I equip it?

1911
02:12:17,570 --> 02:12:18,450
Okay, what's this?

1912
02:12:18,930 --> 02:12:22,730
It has been decreed that those who fight to bring order shall be provided with...

1913
02:12:22,730 --> 02:12:24,150
To aid their... Oh, I got another!

1914
02:12:24,390 --> 02:12:26,530
I got 30?!

1915
02:12:26,530 --> 02:12:28,970
John Fae gave me one?!

1916
02:12:30,450 --> 02:12:32,550
What the fuck?!

1917
02:12:32,550 --> 02:12:35,130
John Fae, you cheap bastard!

1918
02:12:39,650 --> 02:12:40,170
30?!

1919
02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:45,100
Holy shit!

1920
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:48,140
Oh my god, I might as well just max it out.

1921
02:12:49,480 --> 02:12:51,560
I got scammed!

1922
02:12:55,500 --> 02:12:56,700
Alright, nice.

1923
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:57,600
Okay, battle.

1924
02:12:58,060 --> 02:12:59,240
How do I... Oh, there it is!

1925
02:12:59,340 --> 02:12:59,620
Okay.

1926
02:13:00,380 --> 02:13:03,700
Boost damage expands attack range by 12.

1927
02:13:04,280 --> 02:13:07,840
Boost damage dealt restores 30 health for every...

1928
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:11,560
Activates a 32% chance to automatically block an attack.

1929
02:13:11,660 --> 02:13:14,320
I think I want to extend the attack.

1930
02:13:14,420 --> 02:13:15,700
I feel like that's really strong.

1931
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:16,860
In general.

1932
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:19,340
Is there anything else here?

1933
02:13:19,580 --> 02:13:19,980
No?

1934
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:23,160
Wait, great bird's wing.

1935
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:24,840
Boosts health by 10%.

1936
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:25,740
Yeah, let's do that.

1937
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:26,760
Alright.

1938
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:29,840
Yeah, plus attack range sounds incredible.

1939
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:33,460
Jesus Christ, I thought I was like, wow, John Fae!

1940
02:13:33,460 --> 02:13:37,540
He got me one gem, and then the fucking government gave me 30.

1941
02:13:39,780 --> 02:13:40,340
Like...

1942
02:13:40,340 --> 02:13:42,480
I was like, what the fuck?

1943
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:45,540
You mean I could have had 30 gems all along?

1944
02:13:50,730 --> 02:13:51,650
Wait, what's this?

1945
02:13:52,150 --> 02:13:53,110
I found more rocks.

1946
02:13:57,940 --> 02:14:00,480
I was like, there's no way it was just...

1947
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:02,160
Okay, what is the attack...

1948
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:03,080
Oh my...

1949
02:14:03,080 --> 02:14:05,060
What is the attack range anyway?

1950
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:09,240
Unlike...

1951
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:11,480
Like, how far is the...

1952
02:14:12,360 --> 02:14:13,400
It's ranked.

1953
02:14:15,080 --> 02:14:15,840
That's fucking right.

1954
02:14:18,680 --> 02:14:19,760
Where's the other general?

1955
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:21,420
Oh, there you are.

1956
02:14:21,460 --> 02:14:22,180
I see you.

1957
02:14:22,540 --> 02:14:23,280
I see you.

1958
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:24,240
You're 6 feet tall.

1959
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:25,060
I see you.

1960
02:14:27,940 --> 02:14:29,780
Oh, I'm so good at parrying.

1961
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:32,120
Oh my god, I'm fucking gaming.

1962
02:14:33,120 --> 02:14:34,320
That's right, X and then X.

1963
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:37,120
How am I supposed to use my X combo?

1964
02:14:40,700 --> 02:14:41,420
Nice.

1965
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:42,240
I did it.

1966
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:45,500
I love the victory music.

1967
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:46,920
It's such a classic.

1968
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:53,120
Attacking from another PC.

1969
02:14:59,060 --> 02:15:01,440
Am I gonna fight bugs?

1970
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:04,440
Oh.

1971
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:06,680
Oh, it's just random commentary.

1972
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:12,260
What?

1973
02:15:12,500 --> 02:15:13,520
Why are they talking?

1974
02:15:15,220 --> 02:15:16,180
Oh, unlock.

1975
02:15:19,080 --> 02:15:21,880
I thought I was actually gonna start swatting some bugs.

1976
02:15:22,360 --> 02:15:24,080
I was literally getting excited.

1977
02:15:24,340 --> 02:15:26,120
I was like, oh my god, I'm gonna start swatting.

1978
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:26,940
I'm gonna...

1979
02:15:28,280 --> 02:15:29,220
Oh my god.

1980
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:31,900
I'm gonna start swatting.

1981
02:15:32,660 --> 02:15:34,760
Okay, let me...

1982
02:15:34,760 --> 02:15:36,520
I feel like I should get rid of these first.

1983
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:40,040
People talk.

1984
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:41,960
I'm the main character.

1985
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:44,600
The only person that should be talking is me.

1986
02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:47,100
Okay, let's get rid of him.

1987
02:15:48,940 --> 02:15:49,880
Alright, nice.

1988
02:15:50,660 --> 02:15:51,360
That's right.

1989
02:15:51,400 --> 02:15:52,920
You won't even get to move.

1990
02:15:53,680 --> 02:15:54,720
That's right.

1991
02:15:55,320 --> 02:15:56,180
Get out.

1992
02:15:57,740 --> 02:15:58,100
Alright.

1993
02:15:58,480 --> 02:15:59,520
Get away from me.

1994
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:00,500
Move along.

1995
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:03,920
I'm here to fight the mighty Wuhan General.

1996
02:16:04,420 --> 02:16:05,160
Oh shit.

1997
02:16:05,160 --> 02:16:05,300
Alright.

1998
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:07,400
Oh shit, I missed a parry.

1999
02:16:08,680 --> 02:16:09,720
That's okay, he doesn't know that.

2000
02:16:11,420 --> 02:16:12,240
Okay, nice.

2001
02:16:13,420 --> 02:16:13,940
Please.

2002
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:16,240
You are little guys, you don't...

2003
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,520
Oh fuck, it's a...

2004
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:19,820
It's a right attack.

2005
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:21,020
You can't parry right attacks.

2006
02:16:21,620 --> 02:16:22,400
I didn't remember that.

2007
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:23,820
Oh no.

2008
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:24,920
Nice.

2009
02:16:26,700 --> 02:16:27,080
Here we go.

2010
02:16:29,780 --> 02:16:30,600
That's right.

2011
02:16:30,900 --> 02:16:31,380
Goodbye.

2012
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:38,180
Ba-da-da-ba-da-dum!

2013
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:40,500
Yay!

2014
02:16:42,220 --> 02:16:44,580
Ba-da-da-da-dum!

2015
02:16:46,300 --> 02:16:47,520
Alright, how many...

2016
02:16:47,520 --> 02:16:49,280
Oh, I still have zero skill points?

2017
02:16:51,440 --> 02:16:53,960
Okay, I should be able to...

2018
02:16:53,960 --> 02:16:55,460
cross the boat here.

2019
02:16:56,640 --> 02:16:58,160
And then head to the next city.

2020
02:16:58,160 --> 02:16:58,620
Alrighty.

2021
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:05,440
Who cares?

2022
02:17:06,280 --> 02:17:08,800
Who cares about this child?

2023
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:11,860
Oh, wow.

2024
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:18,340
This is my story.

2025
02:17:20,100 --> 02:17:24,560
Who cares about what this child thinks?

2026
02:17:30,300 --> 02:17:30,740
Um...

2027
02:17:32,900 --> 02:17:34,060
Oh, it's like...

2028
02:17:34,060 --> 02:17:35,200
I wanna use the sphere.

2029
02:17:35,300 --> 02:17:36,640
I like the long range.

2030
02:17:37,100 --> 02:17:37,540
Honestly.

2031
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:39,380
I think the long range is really nice.

2032
02:17:40,460 --> 02:17:41,760
There's like nothing...

2033
02:17:41,760 --> 02:17:42,740
Yeah, there's nothing here.

2034
02:17:43,260 --> 02:17:45,220
I don't think I have extra letters from people.

2035
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:48,460
We'll grab this.

2036
02:17:48,600 --> 02:17:50,660
And then we'll steal somebody's money here.

2037
02:17:53,540 --> 02:17:53,980
And...

2038
02:17:53,980 --> 02:17:55,480
Oh, we're in Yan province now.

2039
02:17:55,480 --> 02:17:55,640
Wow.

2040
02:18:00,860 --> 02:18:02,080
Where do we go?

2041
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:03,600
Is that Lu Bu?

2042
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:07,280
Guys, do not pursue Lu Bu.

2043
02:18:09,520 --> 02:18:11,540
Guys, I heard...

2044
02:18:11,540 --> 02:18:13,380
Guys, this is a bad place.

2045
02:18:13,460 --> 02:18:15,180
We should never go in there.

2046
02:18:20,840 --> 02:18:22,960
Time to pursue Lu Bu, I guess.

2047
02:18:24,740 --> 02:18:25,680
Do it!

2048
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:27,140
Challenge him!

2049
02:18:31,640 --> 02:18:32,640
Uh...

2050
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:35,060
New province...

2051
02:18:36,920 --> 02:18:39,080
Where do I progress the story?

2052
02:18:39,640 --> 02:18:41,180
Is it this?

2053
02:18:45,610 --> 02:18:47,290
Oh, there it is.

2054
02:19:11,290 --> 02:19:12,050
Huh?

2055
02:19:21,590 --> 02:19:22,610
That's right.

2056
02:19:22,810 --> 02:19:24,130
God wants money!

2057
02:19:29,390 --> 02:19:32,750
The heavens demand your cash!

2058
02:19:38,650 --> 02:19:41,050
Alright, let's see how hot they are.

2059
02:19:42,190 --> 02:19:42,570
Hahaha!

2060
02:19:44,010 --> 02:19:46,270
Alright, it's time to judge.

2061
02:19:48,190 --> 02:19:48,910
Wait!

2062
02:19:49,770 --> 02:19:51,270
No way!

2063
02:19:52,250 --> 02:19:54,030
Is that...

2064
02:19:56,330 --> 02:20:00,370
Time for the...

2065
02:20:00,370 --> 02:20:00,770
What?

2066
02:20:01,070 --> 02:20:03,230
Is that his voice?

2067
02:20:06,250 --> 02:20:06,970
No!

2068
02:20:12,290 --> 02:20:14,410
Oh my god!

2069
02:20:14,710 --> 02:20:15,790
No way!

2070
02:20:17,110 --> 02:20:19,590
No fucking way!

2071
02:20:26,100 --> 02:20:28,060
Who is he?

2072
02:20:31,740 --> 02:20:33,340
No way!

2073
02:20:34,620 --> 02:20:35,220
No!

2074
02:20:35,580 --> 02:20:37,020
Okay, the third guy!

2075
02:20:37,240 --> 02:20:38,320
Oh my god, he's like...

2076
02:20:38,320 --> 02:20:41,940
Okay, the third guy!

2077
02:20:41,940 --> 02:20:43,500
He's somebody too.

2078
02:20:43,620 --> 02:20:44,380
He's somebody.

2079
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:47,680
I'm trying to remember his name.

2080
02:20:51,500 --> 02:20:53,920
It's CapCap now.

2081
02:20:55,080 --> 02:20:56,540
Is that Xiaohu Yun?

2082
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:59,100
I was like, there's no way!

2083
02:20:59,860 --> 02:21:01,140
Is that Xiaohu Yun?

2084
02:21:01,860 --> 02:21:04,300
I was like, why is he hot too?

2085
02:21:05,640 --> 02:21:06,480
What?

2086
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:09,620
Oh my god!

2087
02:21:09,620 --> 02:21:12,860
Okay, for those who don't know what Xiaohu Yun looks like...

2088
02:21:12,860 --> 02:21:13,620
I was like...

2089
02:21:14,460 --> 02:21:15,120
Um...

2090
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:16,340
No...

2091
02:21:16,340 --> 02:21:19,260
This is what he used...

2092
02:21:19,260 --> 02:21:20,500
Okay, this is...

2093
02:21:21,450 --> 02:21:23,760
This is what he's known to look like.

2094
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:25,520
So I was like...

2095
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:25,900
Why?

2096
02:21:26,780 --> 02:21:29,860
I'm not used to seeing him...

2097
02:21:29,860 --> 02:21:30,860
Fucking hot!

2098
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:33,920
Because he was never supposed to be hot!

2099
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:37,560
I was like, no way!

2100
02:21:37,560 --> 02:21:39,720
Xiaohu Yun looks like...

2101
02:21:40,220 --> 02:21:42,240
This is what he used to look like.

2102
02:21:42,540 --> 02:21:46,260
This is what Xiaohu Yun...

2103
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:51,560
I was not ready...

2104
02:21:52,180 --> 02:21:53,960
To see him like this.

2105
02:21:54,040 --> 02:21:55,780
I was honestly...

2106
02:21:55,780 --> 02:21:57,820
It like, it threw me off.

2107
02:21:58,240 --> 02:22:00,000
It actually threw...

2108
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:01,620
Like, Xiaohu Dun, I like...

2109
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:05,380
Xiaohu Dun, I can see...

2110
02:22:05,380 --> 02:22:07,380
But Xiaohu Yun...

2111
02:22:11,540 --> 02:22:13,100
From dad...

2112
02:22:13,100 --> 02:22:14,480
To dad...

2113
02:22:14,480 --> 02:22:17,160
He had a glow up.

2114
02:22:18,100 --> 02:22:19,340
Oh my god.

2115
02:22:21,400 --> 02:22:22,620
They like...

2116
02:22:22,620 --> 02:22:27,380
What happened to dadness?

2117
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:28,220
Do you worry?

2118
02:22:28,820 --> 02:22:30,740
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

2119
02:22:30,880 --> 02:22:32,360
Thank you, thank you.

2120
02:22:32,360 --> 02:22:33,680
I'm so sad.

2121
02:22:33,740 --> 02:22:36,360
Oh yeah, Xiaohu Dun never got a haircut.

2122
02:22:39,160 --> 02:22:40,080
Sorry, Xiaohu Yun.

2123
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:42,220
Oh my god.

2124
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:45,460
Oh my god.

2125
02:22:45,900 --> 02:22:47,040
That's crazy.

2126
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:48,900
I'm not used to it.

2127
02:22:50,380 --> 02:22:51,820
I'm not...

2128
02:22:52,360 --> 02:22:53,120
Like...

2129
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:55,240
Okay, CaoCao.

2130
02:22:56,140 --> 02:22:58,360
CaoCao also like...

2131
02:22:58,360 --> 02:22:59,760
It's...

2132
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:02,300
CaoCao is also different too.

2133
02:23:02,500 --> 02:23:04,500
But like...

2134
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:06,980
Yun surprised me the most.

2135
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:08,320
Because...

2136
02:23:08,320 --> 02:23:11,160
If anybody was gonna look like a dad...

2137
02:23:11,160 --> 02:23:11,860
It was him.

2138
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:15,380
He has always...

2139
02:23:15,380 --> 02:23:16,900
Looked like a dad.

2140
02:23:17,180 --> 02:23:17,940
For...

2141
02:23:17,940 --> 02:23:19,980
Like an old man.

2142
02:23:20,120 --> 02:23:22,040
For nine games.

2143
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:24,960
And then suddenly I see that guy.

2144
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:26,740
And I was like, oh my god.

2145
02:23:29,060 --> 02:23:30,100
That's...

2146
02:23:30,100 --> 02:23:31,580
That's...

2147
02:23:31,580 --> 02:23:33,220
Oh my god.

2148
02:23:41,210 --> 02:23:43,470
Just wait for XinXianDeV.

2149
02:23:53,510 --> 02:23:56,130
What happened to...

2150
02:23:56,130 --> 02:24:00,550
Do all the random NPCs just take my mustaches away?

2151
02:24:01,070 --> 02:24:01,470
The...

2152
02:24:03,790 --> 02:24:06,510
Only NPCs get to have mustaches.

2153
02:24:18,910 --> 02:24:19,810
I can't.

2154
02:24:19,950 --> 02:24:20,530
I can't.

2155
02:24:20,570 --> 02:24:21,510
Why is Tao Tao...

2156
02:24:21,510 --> 02:24:22,210
I can't.

2157
02:24:22,570 --> 02:24:24,710
Even with Tao Tao so blurry.

2158
02:24:25,130 --> 02:24:25,990
I can't.

2159
02:24:26,150 --> 02:24:27,070
He's so...

2160
02:24:27,070 --> 02:24:28,390
It's so weird.

2161
02:24:29,710 --> 02:24:30,430
It's...

2162
02:24:31,450 --> 02:24:32,170
I just...

2163
02:24:32,170 --> 02:24:33,350
I can't.

2164
02:24:34,970 --> 02:24:38,250
I just feel like he was born with a mustache at that point.

2165
02:24:50,430 --> 02:24:52,130
The mustache is just in DLC.

2166
02:24:52,670 --> 02:24:53,850
I mean, thank you for the super chat.

2167
02:24:53,910 --> 02:24:54,790
Thank you, thank you.

2168
02:24:54,790 --> 02:25:10,010
Let this ragged band of volunteers show that we can be of service to the mighty Han Wait for him to hit Fury Oh my god, why is your hair not spiky?

2169
02:25:10,310 --> 02:25:37,210
For evil I like how like they always make Kao Kao's hair spiky just to be like he's the evil one You will serve under Cao Cao And fight together in the vanguard acceptable, of course Like I can Concluded don't let us down

2170
02:25:53,620 --> 02:25:54,900
My lord, you have returned.

2171
02:25:56,100 --> 02:25:57,400
He's so short!

2172
02:25:57,740 --> 02:25:59,400
Why is he so short?

2173
02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:03,820
Why is he shorter than Liu Bei?

2174
02:26:04,900 --> 02:26:15,620
They are volunteer force They will cross the other turbans in Nioh province They will be under my command in the coming battle He's so small Why is he shorter?

2175
02:26:15,620 --> 02:26:21,920
Allow me to officially introduce myself My name is Cao Cao I look forward to seeing you in the future 5 foot 1?

2176
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:29,780
I didn't know he was 5 foot 1 Wait, he was?

2177
02:26:38,810 --> 02:26:41,000
Oh my god

2178
02:26:47,900 --> 02:27:01,100
Oh my god Still hot Always will be Never change When he gets one eye He gets even hotter guys He gets so cool when he has only one eye

2179
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:12,200
Not even his final... Yeah, not even his final four.

2180
02:27:23,500 --> 02:27:24,180
Oh,

2181
02:27:30,620 --> 02:27:30,840
sorry.

2182
02:27:30,960 --> 02:27:31,080
I got distracted.

2183
02:27:31,100 --> 02:27:32,360
I got distracted in his eyes.

2184
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:35,000
I don't know what you said.

2185
02:27:35,260 --> 02:27:37,500
I got distracted in his eyes.

2186
02:27:38,120 --> 02:27:43,400
I don't know what you said, but understood.

2187
02:27:53,140 --> 02:27:54,660
Please don't... Go back to him.

2188
02:27:54,740 --> 02:27:55,320
Oh, thank you.

2189
02:27:55,940 --> 02:27:56,680
Go back to him.

2190
02:27:58,040 --> 02:28:02,880
Oh my god, why is... Okay, Chow Chow doesn't even sound cool.

2191
02:28:03,160 --> 02:28:06,120
He used to sound so cool, but then Chow Ho Dun...

2192
02:28:06,120 --> 02:28:08,340
Oh, he never... He never changes.

2193
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:09,640
He's always cool.

2194
02:28:10,060 --> 02:28:12,820
His voice actor is always like peak no matter what language.

2195
02:28:31,450 --> 02:28:35,670
My man has one too many eyes.

2196
02:28:39,090 --> 02:28:41,230
Not Doki.

2197
02:28:53,360 --> 02:28:54,060
Oh.

2198
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:55,700
Oh.

2199
02:28:56,320 --> 02:28:57,200
Okay.

2200
02:28:58,460 --> 02:29:01,020
Can't wait to see you without an eye.

2201
02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:01,580
Oh my god.

2202
02:29:01,640 --> 02:29:02,040
No, guys.

2203
02:29:02,100 --> 02:29:03,040
No, you don't understand.

2204
02:29:03,300 --> 02:29:05,960
When he gets that eyepatch... Oh my god.

2205
02:29:06,040 --> 02:29:11,680
When he gets that eyepatch... Oh my god.

2206
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:17,640
If you thought he was cool now, the eyepatch raises him to another level.

2207
02:29:18,340 --> 02:29:22,940
You can't... Guys, everyone thought he was... You can't lie.

2208
02:29:23,420 --> 02:29:27,020
You can't... Even if you're not attracted to men, you cannot lie.

2209
02:29:27,020 --> 02:29:28,460
That he is fucking cool.

2210
02:29:28,740 --> 02:29:33,380
He was actually one of the best... He was the best...

2211
02:29:33,380 --> 02:29:36,240
One of the best character designs in Dynasty Warriors.

2212
02:29:38,920 --> 02:29:40,920
Everyone loves to play him.

2213
02:29:41,340 --> 02:29:42,840
Everyone loves to be him.

2214
02:29:45,060 --> 02:29:46,000
I'm ready.

2215
02:29:46,340 --> 02:29:49,060
Battle of... Okay, I'm...

2216
02:29:49,060 --> 02:29:51,180
I can lie easily.

2217
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:54,060
It's time.

2218
02:29:54,180 --> 02:29:55,040
I'm ready.

2219
02:30:02,350 --> 02:30:04,390
Everyone wanted to be him.

2220
02:30:08,990 --> 02:30:09,630
Me too.

2221
02:30:09,710 --> 02:30:11,230
I miss his long hair too.

2222
02:30:11,350 --> 02:30:12,650
His long hair was so cool.

2223
02:30:14,550 --> 02:30:15,070
Was?

2224
02:30:15,790 --> 02:30:16,590
Still is.

2225
02:30:16,950 --> 02:30:18,610
I'm not attracted to men.

2226
02:30:18,990 --> 02:30:20,310
But to Xiaohudun?

2227
02:30:24,350 --> 02:30:29,050
On an unrelated note, can't wait for you to play Metal Gear Solid Delta.

2228
02:30:29,470 --> 02:30:30,590
Thank you for the super chat.

2229
02:30:30,670 --> 02:30:30,950
Thank you.

2230
02:30:31,030 --> 02:30:31,570
Thank you.

2231
02:30:31,570 --> 02:30:38,530
Okay, General of Earth Zhang Bao is one of the younger brothers of Zhang Xiao, leader of the Yellow Turbans.

2232
02:30:38,670 --> 02:30:43,050
In this battle, we eliminate the Yellow Turbans' leadership, which will in turn stifle their resistance.

2233
02:30:44,210 --> 02:30:45,770
We will be leading the government forces.

2234
02:30:46,390 --> 02:30:48,530
That losing both of them will result in defeat.

2235
02:30:49,510 --> 02:30:50,010
Be careful.

2236
02:30:51,650 --> 02:30:55,470
Caca will hardly consider a victory if we lost a commander in process.

2237
02:30:57,430 --> 02:31:02,470
Xiaohudun, but with Yuan by my side, I have nothing to fear from the Yellow Turbans.

2238
02:31:04,270 --> 02:31:06,130
You're safe with us, my lord.

2239
02:31:06,170 --> 02:31:07,630
We'll guard you with our lives.

2240
02:31:08,710 --> 02:31:11,410
I need to know what... I want to know what Wu looks like.

2241
02:31:11,510 --> 02:31:15,010
I need to know what they look like.

2242
02:31:17,430 --> 02:31:19,870
What does Sun Tze look like?

2243
02:31:20,530 --> 02:31:23,010
You must not let our guard down any time during this battle.

2244
02:31:23,290 --> 02:31:24,370
The meeting is finished.

2245
02:31:24,530 --> 02:31:26,190
Make sure you're thoroughly prepared.

2246
02:31:26,810 --> 02:31:27,730
I need to know.

2247
02:31:28,090 --> 02:31:30,250
I need to know.

2248
02:31:39,810 --> 02:31:41,390
No one messaged you yet.

2249
02:31:41,470 --> 02:31:42,490
Can we change the battle?

2250
02:31:42,630 --> 02:31:43,490
Do you wish to proceed?

2251
02:31:45,770 --> 02:31:53,330
The game will pause whenever... the game will pause only also when messages... the game will not pause.

2252
02:31:53,450 --> 02:31:56,470
I don't think we need to pause when messages are shown.

2253
02:31:58,210 --> 02:31:59,270
Alright, here we go.

2254
02:32:02,910 --> 02:32:09,770
Alright, battle areas with active fighting are shown in blue if allies are winning.

2255
02:32:09,770 --> 02:32:11,070
Or Sun Tze En.

2256
02:32:11,310 --> 02:32:12,130
Sun Tze En, right?

2257
02:32:12,330 --> 02:32:14,770
I want to know what Sun Tze En looks like.

2258
02:32:16,650 --> 02:32:19,550
I keep forgetting that Sun Tze En fucking dies so fast.

2259
02:32:20,910 --> 02:32:22,770
Because the story became like...

2260
02:32:24,070 --> 02:32:24,950
Alright, there we go.

2261
02:32:27,730 --> 02:32:29,050
Come on, let's get them out of here.

2262
02:32:29,650 --> 02:32:30,490
They're so easy.

2263
02:32:30,650 --> 02:32:31,550
That's right, parry!

2264
02:32:32,390 --> 02:32:34,770
Oh shit, I forgot to do the other parry.

2265
02:32:38,790 --> 02:32:40,290
Alright, get out of here!

2266
02:32:40,910 --> 02:32:41,970
He's already dead.

2267
02:32:45,470 --> 02:32:46,790
He's already dead.

2268
02:32:46,930 --> 02:32:47,770
What did he say?

2269
02:32:48,430 --> 02:32:50,190
Guess we'll never know!

2270
02:32:52,210 --> 02:32:52,690
Spoiled!

2271
02:32:56,370 --> 02:32:57,890
Okay, we gotta take this hapless.

2272
02:32:58,670 --> 02:32:59,070
Get through!

2273
02:32:59,610 --> 02:33:00,430
Let me in!

2274
02:33:00,470 --> 02:33:01,150
Let me in!

2275
02:33:02,750 --> 02:33:04,750
Alright, let's get rid of all these men.

2276
02:33:09,070 --> 02:33:12,690
Yeah, Wu's storyline is like...

2277
02:33:12,690 --> 02:33:29,070
I remember in the very first few games of Dynasty Warriors, they made it seem like Sun Tze En was very, very important to the Three Kingdoms, but he literally...

2278
02:33:29,070 --> 02:33:30,310
What the fuck?

2279
02:33:31,670 --> 02:33:33,090
Oh my god!

2280
02:33:33,850 --> 02:33:34,730
Oh my... Wu!

2281
02:33:34,730 --> 02:33:35,590
Witchcraft!

2282
02:33:38,710 --> 02:33:41,170
I thought he was like, super important.

2283
02:33:42,170 --> 02:33:46,190
And then like, later on in the newer games, they're like...

2284
02:33:46,190 --> 02:33:49,470
By the way, he dies like, after the first chapter.

2285
02:33:53,910 --> 02:33:54,750
Oh shit.

2286
02:34:04,790 --> 02:34:06,030
What do I see?

2287
02:34:06,970 --> 02:34:09,990
Survey with your eyes of the sacred bird?

2288
02:34:10,350 --> 02:34:10,750
LT.

2289
02:34:12,990 --> 02:34:15,330
What do I see with my special eyes?

2290
02:34:18,770 --> 02:34:19,490
What?

2291
02:34:22,290 --> 02:34:24,750
Moved in search of superstitious...

2292
02:34:24,750 --> 02:34:25,850
Oh, it's a vase!

2293
02:34:30,590 --> 02:34:31,670
My brain!

2294
02:34:34,730 --> 02:34:37,630
You are a guardian of peace.

2295
02:34:38,730 --> 02:34:41,250
Use this power to do what must be done.

2296
02:34:43,990 --> 02:34:49,410
You possess a special power called the Eyes of the Sacred Bird, allowing you to see things.

2297
02:34:49,550 --> 02:34:52,270
This includes the ability to perceive the flow of incense.

2298
02:34:53,470 --> 02:34:56,390
Your eyes show the health of those as well as the situation.

2299
02:34:56,650 --> 02:34:58,410
Use them well to maintain an advantage.

2300
02:34:59,570 --> 02:35:00,510
What the fuck?

2301
02:35:00,810 --> 02:35:03,450
Oh, I can see their HP on the other side!

2302
02:35:06,150 --> 02:35:07,870
Where is the incense?

2303
02:35:08,490 --> 02:35:09,150
Oh, it's up here.

2304
02:35:12,550 --> 02:35:13,970
Alright, I'm breaking the jar.

2305
02:35:14,890 --> 02:35:15,590
That's right!

2306
02:35:15,690 --> 02:35:17,130
No more sorcery!

2307
02:35:17,170 --> 02:35:18,430
We can't get high anymore.

2308
02:35:19,290 --> 02:35:20,430
That's fucking right.

2309
02:35:22,750 --> 02:35:23,870
Reveal yourself!

2310
02:35:24,210 --> 02:35:25,250
And it was nothing!

2311
02:35:25,390 --> 02:35:26,090
Oh my god.

2312
02:35:26,110 --> 02:35:27,910
Oh, and it was nothing!

2313
02:35:36,590 --> 02:35:37,430
Where is he?

2314
02:35:38,030 --> 02:35:39,110
Where is the six foot man?

2315
02:35:40,590 --> 02:35:41,130
That's right!

2316
02:35:41,570 --> 02:35:45,810
You may be tall, but can you handle this?

2317
02:35:49,730 --> 02:35:50,930
That's fucking right.

2318
02:35:51,190 --> 02:35:52,710
No sor- what did I- where am I?

2319
02:35:53,990 --> 02:35:56,930
Like, I'm part of the trees now.

2320
02:35:59,890 --> 02:36:01,110
Nice, we did it.

2321
02:36:01,910 --> 02:36:05,610
The sorcery has stopped the advance of...

2322
02:36:05,610 --> 02:36:06,270
Alright,

2323
02:36:10,010 --> 02:36:10,730
let's go this way.

2324
02:36:13,210 --> 02:36:14,470
We gotta get rid of this base.

2325
02:36:16,750 --> 02:36:17,310
Oh no.

2326
02:36:17,970 --> 02:36:19,090
Oh, I broke it just in time.

2327
02:36:21,190 --> 02:36:22,770
Don't worry, I'm gonna do this combo I learned.

2328
02:36:22,910 --> 02:36:29,430
It's X, and then X, and then X, and then X, and then- Okay, hey, hey, hey, hey man.

2329
02:36:29,790 --> 02:36:32,390
I was supposed to do my X move, guys.

2330
02:36:33,130 --> 02:36:34,510
That's so rude.

2331
02:36:35,110 --> 02:36:37,350
I can never do my X combo.

2332
02:36:37,750 --> 02:36:39,350
Like, I don't understand.

2333
02:36:40,710 --> 02:36:44,830
Why gave me that combo if I can't even do it?

2334
02:36:45,250 --> 02:36:47,370
It just gets interrupted.

2335
02:36:50,110 --> 02:36:52,710
What a difficult combo.

2336
02:36:58,610 --> 02:36:59,650
Alright.

2337
02:37:00,650 --> 02:37:06,650
I just- oh shit.

2338
02:37:07,230 --> 02:37:16,170
Where is- Okay, this is where- It's like Dicky Assassin's Creed.

2339
02:37:21,230 --> 02:37:23,910
It's like- It's like picking the eagle screech.

2340
02:37:24,430 --> 02:37:25,550
Alright, smash.

2341
02:37:32,560 --> 02:37:34,200
Wait, there's another one?

2342
02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:37,320
Okay.

2343
02:37:40,860 --> 02:37:41,900
Where's the other one?

2344
02:37:42,680 --> 02:37:43,340
Oh shit.

2345
02:37:44,780 --> 02:37:45,840
Where the- oh, it's on the other side.

2346
02:37:45,880 --> 02:37:47,240
Oh fuck, come on!

2347
02:37:48,880 --> 02:37:48,900
Wah!

2348
02:37:52,160 --> 02:37:53,000
Wah!

2349
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:56,000
I can't!

2350
02:37:56,420 --> 02:37:57,820
I can't!

2351
02:37:57,940 --> 02:37:58,520
The sound!

2352
02:37:58,840 --> 02:37:59,340
Freedom!

2353
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:03,580
I'm sorry.

2354
02:38:03,940 --> 02:38:05,800
I like- I enjoy the little things.

2355
02:38:06,300 --> 02:38:09,120
I enjoy the little things in life.

2356
02:38:12,340 --> 02:38:13,180
Freedom!

2357
02:38:18,520 --> 02:38:18,960
Woo!

2358
02:38:22,300 --> 02:38:23,340
We did it!

2359
02:38:24,680 --> 02:38:25,700
Alright, get him!

2360
02:38:26,040 --> 02:38:26,760
Get him!

2361
02:38:26,940 --> 02:38:28,720
He's trying to use witchcraft!

2362
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:29,520
Get him!

2363
02:38:30,340 --> 02:38:32,360
Alright, X and then- oh my god, I did it!

2364
02:38:32,660 --> 02:38:32,920
Guys!

2365
02:38:33,360 --> 02:38:34,260
I did- guys!

2366
02:38:34,540 --> 02:38:35,820
I just did the combo!

2367
02:38:37,320 --> 02:38:39,820
Oh my go- I just- guys, I just did the X combo.

2368
02:38:39,880 --> 02:38:40,580
Are you proud of me?

2369
02:38:40,580 --> 02:38:43,280
The hardest combo I've ever done.

2370
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:45,500
I did it.

2371
02:38:50,240 --> 02:38:50,940
Yay!

2372
02:38:51,480 --> 02:38:53,100
I saved Kow Kows!

2373
02:38:53,360 --> 02:38:54,420
Oh shit, um.

2374
02:38:55,500 --> 02:38:56,200
Whoops.

2375
02:38:57,120 --> 02:38:58,220
Um, sorry.

2376
02:38:58,620 --> 02:39:06,380
I saw a door and I just- I tried to move so it- It came around the ear.

2377
02:39:10,580 --> 02:39:11,980
I couldn't help it.

2378
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:15,300
I was like, you- you fuck this door.

2379
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:21,900
That's right, interruption.

2380
02:39:22,820 --> 02:39:24,620
You had to hit that door.

2381
02:39:25,080 --> 02:39:26,020
I thought- guys, sorry.

2382
02:39:26,120 --> 02:39:27,820
I thought I was playing Dynasty Warriors 6.

2383
02:39:30,280 --> 02:39:30,800
Nice.

2384
02:39:34,620 --> 02:39:35,140
Alright.

2385
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:36,740
Did I get rid of the base?

2386
02:39:36,980 --> 02:39:38,180
This is my base now.

2387
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:39,760
This is my house.

2388
02:39:42,620 --> 02:39:43,220
Wait.

2389
02:39:44,280 --> 02:39:44,880
Wait.

2390
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:45,620
Oh shit!

2391
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:46,600
Oh shit!

2392
02:39:46,940 --> 02:39:47,340
Chao Chao!

2393
02:39:48,020 --> 02:39:48,820
Oh fuck!

2394
02:39:48,900 --> 02:39:49,300
Oh fuck!

2395
02:39:49,400 --> 02:39:49,780
I'm coming over!

2396
02:39:50,200 --> 02:39:51,920
Oh my god, you're still a baby!

2397
02:39:52,020 --> 02:39:53,580
I'm coming over, Chao Chao!

2398
02:39:53,640 --> 02:39:59,160
You're still- I forgot you're still a baby!

2399
02:39:59,820 --> 02:40:02,720
You haven't grown your must- Chao Chao!

2400
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:04,540
You haven't grown back!

2401
02:40:04,720 --> 02:40:07,340
God, Chao- what the- what happened to you?

2402
02:40:10,760 --> 02:40:11,760
I'm sorry.

2403
02:40:11,800 --> 02:40:15,540
I didn't- I didn't realize you were still a baby!

2404
02:40:15,880 --> 02:40:16,340
I'm coming!

2405
02:40:16,520 --> 02:40:17,060
Don't worry!

2406
02:40:17,400 --> 02:40:18,060
Don't worry!

2407
02:40:20,280 --> 02:40:21,580
I didn't realize!

2408
02:40:22,900 --> 02:40:24,000
I went too fast.

2409
02:40:24,460 --> 02:40:28,240
Guys, he was still a baby and I didn't realize.

2410
02:40:29,880 --> 02:40:31,040
Oh my god.

2411
02:40:31,920 --> 02:40:33,280
It's a little scary though.

2412
02:40:36,200 --> 02:40:37,220
I'm here!

2413
02:40:40,580 --> 02:40:40,840
Don't worry!

2414
02:40:40,980 --> 02:40:42,020
Don't let him hit you!

2415
02:40:43,440 --> 02:40:44,040
Nice.

2416
02:40:44,780 --> 02:40:45,380
Alright.

2417
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:49,880
How could you let a guy with a fan fucking beat you up like that?

2418
02:40:50,260 --> 02:40:51,740
Honestly, so embarrassing.

2419
02:40:52,540 --> 02:40:54,100
So fucking embarrassing.

2420
02:40:54,660 --> 02:40:58,740
I swear if like, he dies to arrows, I swear to god.

2421
02:40:59,340 --> 02:41:01,860
Like, I- come on.

2422
02:41:02,860 --> 02:41:04,960
Oh my god, he's so tanky!

2423
02:41:05,500 --> 02:41:08,220
It's cause he's so fucking big!

2424
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:10,840
Like, he's like 7 foot tall!

2425
02:41:10,940 --> 02:41:13,480
What am I supposed to do when they're 7 feet tall?

2426
02:41:14,400 --> 02:41:17,440
Like, Chao Chao is just 5 feet!

2427
02:41:18,120 --> 02:41:22,340
Like, he was not- he was not meant to be in fights like this.

2428
02:41:22,340 --> 02:41:22,780
You-

2429
02:41:27,100 --> 02:41:27,400
Alright.

2430
02:41:30,740 --> 02:41:31,660
Is he okay?

2431
02:41:32,480 --> 02:41:33,380
Oh shit, Chao Chao!

2432
02:41:33,580 --> 02:41:34,600
Chao Chao, don't worry!

2433
02:41:34,860 --> 02:41:35,680
I got you!

2434
02:41:36,600 --> 02:41:38,640
I- I got you, don't worry!

2435
02:41:39,560 --> 02:41:40,380
You're safe!

2436
02:41:41,780 --> 02:41:45,220
Okay, now I can help the people on this side.

2437
02:41:46,060 --> 02:41:46,560
Alright.

2438
02:41:48,740 --> 02:41:49,800
Oh shit!

2439
02:41:50,820 --> 02:41:51,960
Cho Jin!

2440
02:41:53,400 --> 02:41:55,100
I'm so sorry!

2441
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:57,200
I had to help Chao Chao!

2442
02:41:59,560 --> 02:42:00,300
Oh no.

2443
02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:02,520
This is so bad.

2444
02:42:09,480 --> 02:42:12,900
Give me a sec, I gotta- it's over here.

2445
02:42:14,180 --> 02:42:15,420
It's over here.

2446
02:42:16,080 --> 02:42:18,800
Don't worry, I'm just gonna run past them.

2447
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:26,080
I like how he's like, I shall guard the base with my life!

2448
02:42:28,640 --> 02:42:32,880
I shall guard this base with my life!

2449
02:42:36,300 --> 02:42:39,820
Guys, I don't think he guarded the base, guys.

2450
02:42:40,140 --> 02:42:43,500
I- I- I don't think he did it.

2451
02:42:43,900 --> 02:42:45,840
Worst soldier ever.

2452
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:52,020
Alright, I gotta get rid of these guys.

2453
02:42:52,200 --> 02:42:54,420
Like, I cannot be bothered.

2454
02:42:54,640 --> 02:42:55,600
Don't worry, Gwon Yoon.

2455
02:42:57,740 --> 02:42:58,620
What, Chao Hu?

2456
02:42:58,800 --> 02:43:05,840
I can- Guys, there's only one of me, guys.

2457
02:43:05,940 --> 02:43:07,260
I think- Oh no.

2458
02:43:09,980 --> 02:43:11,380
Oh, come on!

2459
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:15,100
Please!

2460
02:43:15,910 --> 02:43:18,040
Hit all my- Chao Hu, no!

2461
02:43:23,860 --> 02:43:27,800
Oh my god, I cannot kill everything!

2462
02:43:28,320 --> 02:43:28,940
Please!

2463
02:43:29,820 --> 02:43:30,440
Please!

2464
02:43:30,840 --> 02:43:33,460
Stop making me do everything!

2465
02:43:34,020 --> 02:43:35,280
Chao Hu, don't!

2466
02:43:36,360 --> 02:43:36,840
No!

2467
02:43:37,560 --> 02:43:41,440
Guys, this is looking bad.

2468
02:43:41,500 --> 02:43:43,280
I think I'm gonna get my first loss, guys.

2469
02:43:43,280 --> 02:43:45,040
This is actually looking bad.

2470
02:43:45,100 --> 02:43:50,580
I- But it's not even- Oh my god, Chao Chao, please!

2471
02:43:50,920 --> 02:43:52,440
Chao Chao, I have to kill him!

2472
02:43:52,840 --> 02:43:54,020
Chao Chao, please!

2473
02:43:54,360 --> 02:43:56,020
I have to kill him first!

2474
02:43:56,600 --> 02:43:57,500
Okay, I'm coming over!

2475
02:43:58,380 --> 02:44:00,100
Chao Chao, fucking live!

2476
02:44:00,380 --> 02:44:02,240
I'm fucking running over!

2477
02:44:04,400 --> 02:44:06,120
Chao Chao, please!

2478
02:44:06,380 --> 02:44:07,640
I'm climbing the- Live!

2479
02:44:08,340 --> 02:44:08,500
Live!

2480
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:11,560
Oh my god!

2481
02:44:12,600 --> 02:44:14,420
Guys, this is my first loss!

2482
02:44:15,420 --> 02:44:18,660
Guys, I don't think- Holy shit!

2483
02:44:19,160 --> 02:44:21,720
Guys, this is not looking so-

2484
02:44:27,260 --> 02:44:28,900
Okay, I'm coming over!

2485
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:30,360
I'm coming!

2486
02:44:30,940 --> 02:44:31,340
Please!

2487
02:44:31,960 --> 02:44:33,640
I'm fucking- I went too fast!

2488
02:44:34,120 --> 02:44:36,760
I- I- I went too fast, guys.

2489
02:44:36,820 --> 02:44:40,700
I think- Oh my god!

2490
02:44:40,740 --> 02:44:41,720
Oh no!

2491
02:44:42,100 --> 02:44:43,700
Guys, I went too fast!

2492
02:44:44,320 --> 02:44:45,160
Oh no!

2493
02:44:45,680 --> 02:44:47,440
I'm coming over!

2494
02:44:47,840 --> 02:44:48,860
I'm coming over!

2495
02:44:49,080 --> 02:44:49,280
Please!

2496
02:44:49,720 --> 02:44:50,100
Please!

2497
02:44:50,580 --> 02:44:51,100
Please!

2498
02:44:51,340 --> 02:44:51,880
Chao Chao!

2499
02:44:52,180 --> 02:44:53,540
Oh my god, Chao Chao!

2500
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:55,160
Oh, thank god, he ate a bun!

2501
02:44:55,660 --> 02:44:56,640
Oh, thank god!

2502
02:44:57,360 --> 02:44:58,880
Oh my god!

2503
02:44:59,360 --> 02:45:01,080
Oh, thank god!

2504
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:04,380
Oh, thank god!

2505
02:45:04,480 --> 02:45:05,360
He ate bread!

2506
02:45:05,660 --> 02:45:06,500
He ate bread!

2507
02:45:06,940 --> 02:45:07,960
Oh, thank god!

2508
02:45:08,240 --> 02:45:10,480
Oh, thank god!

2509
02:45:10,920 --> 02:45:12,400
Oh, I'm so happy!

2510
02:45:12,820 --> 02:45:14,020
He ate bread!

2511
02:45:14,600 --> 02:45:15,740
There's still hope!

2512
02:45:16,140 --> 02:45:17,940
There's actually still hope!

2513
02:45:18,340 --> 02:45:19,260
Oh my god!

2514
02:45:19,660 --> 02:45:23,880
I'm- I'm gonna- I'm actually- I'm gonna head over to him.

2515
02:45:24,180 --> 02:45:26,460
I can't- I don't trust Chao Chao!

2516
02:45:26,700 --> 02:45:27,840
You have to live!

2517
02:45:28,140 --> 02:45:28,600
You-

2518
02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:33,780
Like, I can't!

2519
02:45:35,780 --> 02:45:38,560
Oh my god, just keep eating bread!

2520
02:45:39,060 --> 02:45:41,940
Actually, just- just keep eating bread!

2521
02:45:42,240 --> 02:45:42,480
Please!

2522
02:45:44,280 --> 02:45:45,960
Please, that's all I ask!

2523
02:45:46,260 --> 02:45:47,900
Like, I don't ask for much!

2524
02:45:48,220 --> 02:45:49,240
Just keep eating!

2525
02:45:51,560 --> 02:45:52,460
Oh god!

2526
02:45:54,220 --> 02:45:55,340
That's all I want!

2527
02:45:56,200 --> 02:45:56,900
Just keep eating!

2528
02:45:57,400 --> 02:46:00,380
Legitimately, just keep eating bread, Chao Chao!

2529
02:46:00,500 --> 02:46:01,980
That's all you need to do!

2530
02:46:02,020 --> 02:46:03,240
You have no other!

2531
02:46:03,980 --> 02:46:05,700
You have no other mission!

2532
02:46:06,180 --> 02:46:07,680
You just eat bread!

2533
02:46:09,160 --> 02:46:10,980
Oh my god, he's so strong though!

2534
02:46:11,540 --> 02:46:13,440
Like, he's so strong!

2535
02:46:13,840 --> 02:46:14,760
He's so strong!

2536
02:46:15,220 --> 02:46:16,280
Oh my god, okay!

2537
02:46:17,100 --> 02:46:18,860
Come on!

2538
02:46:20,800 --> 02:46:21,420
Oh!

2539
02:46:21,740 --> 02:46:22,160
Nice!

2540
02:46:23,100 --> 02:46:23,980
Nice!

2541
02:46:25,280 --> 02:46:27,420
He's the last- Oh, thank god!

2542
02:46:27,840 --> 02:46:28,360
Eat!

2543
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:30,800
Eat!

2544
02:46:30,800 --> 02:46:30,800
Eat!

2545
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:37,720
Oh my god!

2546
02:46:38,200 --> 02:46:39,800
I saved him!

2547
02:46:40,100 --> 02:46:41,600
I saved him!

2548
02:46:41,600 --> 02:46:43,760
Oh my god!

2549
02:46:44,360 --> 02:46:46,420
No defeat here!

2550
02:46:48,260 --> 02:46:50,940
Brent saves lives!

2551
02:46:53,480 --> 02:46:55,980
Oh, thank fucking god!

2552
02:46:57,160 --> 02:46:59,200
It was so scary!

2553
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:00,920
It was so scary!

2554
02:47:02,840 --> 02:47:04,700
The Brent for the win!

2555
02:47:06,800 --> 02:47:08,900
Alright, L-B-Y.

2556
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:10,060
L-Y.

2557
02:47:10,440 --> 02:47:12,600
Enable the use of L-B-Y.

2558
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:15,640
Alright, that was so stressful, not gonna lie.

2559
02:47:15,740 --> 02:47:17,920
That was actually so fucking loud!

2560
02:47:18,700 --> 02:47:26,400
I think I killed people too fast that my little guys just kept going for it.

2561
02:47:28,220 --> 02:47:30,600
I don't think they were ready for it.

2562
02:47:31,380 --> 02:47:33,740
I need 20 points.

2563
02:47:33,980 --> 02:47:34,480
I have 13.

2564
02:47:40,320 --> 02:47:41,040
Liv!

2565
02:47:41,720 --> 02:47:42,240
Liv!

2566
02:47:45,540 --> 02:47:48,180
I literally soloed the war.

2567
02:47:51,740 --> 02:47:52,640
Wait, you're right!

2568
02:47:52,740 --> 02:47:54,480
Why am I not invited to the war?

2569
02:47:54,480 --> 02:47:56,140
I fucking saved his life!

2570
02:48:03,700 --> 02:48:04,280
Oh!

2571
02:48:19,140 --> 02:48:19,980
That's right.

2572
02:48:20,340 --> 02:48:21,380
They fucking ran!

2573
02:48:21,700 --> 02:48:23,180
I was there for you, Tau Tau!

2574
02:48:29,660 --> 02:48:31,100
They all ran!

2575
02:48:33,700 --> 02:48:34,660
Why, thank you.

2576
02:48:35,740 --> 02:48:36,580
Lord Tau Tau.

2577
02:48:38,040 --> 02:48:41,780
We owe our success in battle to this warrior.

2578
02:48:42,440 --> 02:48:42,900
That's me!

2579
02:48:43,160 --> 02:48:44,200
That's me, guys!

2580
02:48:47,280 --> 02:48:50,180
I look like such an emo kid too.

2581
02:48:52,980 --> 02:48:54,340
Thank you for the superchat!

2582
02:48:54,440 --> 02:48:55,040
Thank you, thank you!

2583
02:49:04,020 --> 02:49:05,720
He's gonna take an arrow to the eye soon.

2584
02:49:06,160 --> 02:49:07,640
It's gonna look so fucking cool.

2585
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:09,460
It's gonna look so cool.

2586
02:49:09,520 --> 02:49:11,900
And you're like, thank god he lost his eye.

2587
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:14,180
Because it was so hot.

2588
02:49:19,240 --> 02:49:22,060
Wait, why is it- Oh my god, guys, do you see this child?

2589
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:25,180
Oh my god.

2590
02:49:30,880 --> 02:49:33,880
Guys, guys, do you guys also see this child, guys?

2591
02:49:40,620 --> 02:49:43,700
I'm just looking at the child and being like, what the fuck?

2592
02:49:53,880 --> 02:49:55,760
Yes, I like it too.

2593
02:49:56,220 --> 02:50:12,040
I like how Shao Dun is just posing like a model.

2594
02:50:12,620 --> 02:50:18,420
He's just like, god, I don't know what's going on, but I look so cool.

2595
02:50:21,060 --> 02:50:23,640
It was like, arms on his hips too.

2596
02:50:29,400 --> 02:50:30,820
He's farming aura.

2597
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,880
Oh my god, the more I fight, the more I remember.

2598
02:50:48,420 --> 02:50:48,960
That's what you want.

2599
02:50:59,540 --> 02:50:59,980
Who?

2600
02:51:05,440 --> 02:51:07,280
But who didn't survive?

2601
02:51:07,540 --> 02:51:08,840
Wait, we have the same outfit.

2602
02:51:13,710 --> 02:51:15,170
Same clothes.

2603
02:51:21,610 --> 02:51:23,250
I'm loving this game right now.

2604
02:51:25,370 --> 02:51:25,970
Oh wait.

2605
02:51:29,830 --> 02:51:34,110
I think this ability is my favorite.

2606
02:51:40,130 --> 02:51:42,930
I love this ability.

2607
02:51:52,320 --> 02:51:56,060
I can't, I'm sorry, this is actually my favorite ability.

2608
02:51:59,980 --> 02:52:03,020
Okay, okay, sorry, I'll talk to you again.

2609
02:52:05,440 --> 02:52:07,880
Hey there, that's you, isn't it?

2610
02:52:15,680 --> 02:52:18,060
I bet you can do it.

2611
02:52:20,640 --> 02:52:21,200
Oh,

2612
02:52:36,640 --> 02:52:37,060
okay.

2613
02:52:38,960 --> 02:52:41,700
Wait, do I have... oh, it's just my tent.

2614
02:52:42,280 --> 02:52:43,100
What's this?

2615
02:52:45,580 --> 02:52:47,200
Suppression of you province?

2616
02:52:53,340 --> 02:52:55,080
Do I, should I rest?

2617
02:52:55,200 --> 02:52:56,460
No, I don't feel like it.

2618
02:52:56,640 --> 02:52:58,300
I know, it's like relationship.

2619
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,340
I was like, what is that supposed to mean?

2620
02:53:10,140 --> 02:53:11,160
What's this camp?

2621
02:53:11,640 --> 02:53:12,580
Is this a mission?

2622
02:53:19,700 --> 02:53:20,680
The Jinn province.

2623
02:53:21,380 --> 02:53:23,280
Are we romancing the three kingdoms now?

2624
02:53:35,660 --> 02:53:36,180
Yeah,

2625
02:53:40,680 --> 02:53:41,520
this game is really good.

2626
02:53:41,600 --> 02:53:44,500
I'm like, I'm really enjoying it right now.

2627
02:53:51,940 --> 02:53:55,500
Ah, finally, the romance of the romance of the three kingdoms.

2628
02:53:57,060 --> 02:53:59,340
I've been waiting for this my entire life.

2629
02:54:03,680 --> 02:54:04,480
That's me.

2630
02:54:09,320 --> 02:54:12,420
Oh my god, he's like, he said my name.

2631
02:54:12,500 --> 02:54:13,580
I'm so happy.

2632
02:54:14,060 --> 02:54:14,660
Sun Jian!

2633
02:54:15,060 --> 02:54:15,700
Sun Jian!

2634
02:54:17,520 --> 02:54:17,880
Okay.

2635
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:20,500
What does he look like?

2636
02:54:20,500 --> 02:54:22,380
Oh my god, finally.

2637
02:54:22,880 --> 02:54:24,900
What does he look like?

2638
02:54:29,060 --> 02:54:29,880
Oh my...

2639
02:54:29,880 --> 02:54:30,340
No!

2640
02:54:33,980 --> 02:54:36,100
Oh, there he is.

2641
02:54:36,280 --> 02:54:36,760
There he is.

2642
02:54:37,080 --> 02:54:38,260
Okay, with the suit.

2643
02:54:38,520 --> 02:54:41,300
Oh, is he the only old man?

2644
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:43,340
Oh my god.

2645
02:54:43,660 --> 02:54:47,240
He looks... yeah, that definitely looks like a guy that's about to die.

2646
02:54:52,040 --> 02:54:56,500
He has... yeah, that looks like a man that's about to fucking die.

2647
02:54:57,020 --> 02:54:58,700
The last old man.

2648
02:55:07,960 --> 02:55:12,640
He's only thirty... oh my... he has earrings now!

2649
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:15,780
Oh my god, he looks like a fucking pirate.

2650
02:55:19,780 --> 02:55:20,340
Yeah.

2651
02:55:23,840 --> 02:55:27,180
In the older games, they made the leaders all the same age.

2652
02:55:48,890 --> 02:55:49,710
Oh my god.

2653
02:55:50,510 --> 02:55:52,710
The last old man in this game.

2654
02:55:54,770 --> 02:55:58,850
And he only lives for like one to two fights.

2655
02:56:13,680 --> 02:56:16,900
Oh my god, I like the earrings feature.

2656
02:56:16,900 --> 02:56:18,900
Cause like, um...

2657
02:56:19,660 --> 02:56:23,460
His kingdom is more focused on like pirates and water.

2658
02:56:24,120 --> 02:56:27,260
So I really like the design elements that they added.

2659
02:56:27,680 --> 02:56:30,980
Where like, yeah, they're like known to be really great at naval battles.

2660
02:56:31,420 --> 02:56:36,320
So I like that for this one, they made him more like a pirate... like a pirate.

2661
02:56:37,760 --> 02:56:40,340
They put... to distinguish between the kingdoms.

2662
02:56:40,940 --> 02:56:42,480
And fire too, yeah, fire.

2663
02:56:42,560 --> 02:56:43,220
That's why they're red.

2664
02:56:46,900 --> 02:56:47,940
What's this one?

2665
02:56:48,620 --> 02:56:50,160
The Suppression of Yu Province.

2666
02:56:51,760 --> 02:56:53,800
Okay, wait.

2667
02:56:53,920 --> 02:56:55,720
Let me get some upgrades first.

2668
02:56:56,460 --> 02:56:57,840
I'm gonna get some upgrades first.

2669
02:56:58,320 --> 02:56:59,360
Where's my tent?

2670
02:56:59,800 --> 02:57:01,020
I wanna see my fan mail.

2671
02:57:02,580 --> 02:57:03,560
Where's my tent?

2672
02:57:05,400 --> 02:57:08,080
Alright, I don't have any new fan mail?

2673
02:57:09,060 --> 02:57:11,120
Where's my fan mail, guys?

2674
02:57:13,160 --> 02:57:14,240
Alright, nice.

2675
02:57:14,340 --> 02:57:16,020
I'll grab upgrade these.

2676
02:57:19,240 --> 02:57:19,880
Um...

2677
02:57:19,880 --> 02:57:20,320
No!

2678
02:57:21,020 --> 02:57:22,440
No fan mail!

2679
02:57:23,060 --> 02:57:24,380
No more mail.

2680
02:57:25,320 --> 02:57:25,860
Alright.

2681
02:57:26,080 --> 02:57:27,940
Aw, I really don't wanna stop playing.

2682
02:57:28,140 --> 02:57:29,780
I'm actually really enjoying this game.

2683
02:57:29,840 --> 02:57:32,200
But tomorrow's gonna be a super long stream.

2684
02:57:32,940 --> 02:57:36,200
And I wanna make sure I don't overdo it, guys.

2685
02:57:36,600 --> 02:57:37,200
Ah!

2686
02:57:37,700 --> 02:57:42,240
I'm actually... I'm actually enjoying this game a lot right now.

2687
02:57:42,380 --> 02:57:44,020
Like, um...

2688
02:57:44,020 --> 02:57:45,260
Oh my god.

2689
02:57:45,380 --> 02:57:46,820
No super chats, guys.

2690
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:47,320
No.

2691
02:57:48,100 --> 02:57:49,620
Guys, I can't believe it.

2692
02:57:49,680 --> 02:57:54,060
I don't have any new super chats from Ancient China.

2693
02:57:56,480 --> 02:57:59,460
I'm so sad from the very first Dragoons.

2694
02:57:59,880 --> 02:58:04,000
But I'm loving this playthrough a lot.

2695
02:58:04,940 --> 02:58:08,120
And also, Black5, thank you 5, get the chips.

2696
02:58:08,280 --> 02:58:09,120
Thank you, thank you.

2697
02:58:09,420 --> 02:58:12,600
And we're definitely gonna do a part 2.

2698
02:58:12,600 --> 02:58:16,660
Um, we're definitely gonna do a part 2, um, next week.

2699
02:58:16,860 --> 02:58:19,380
Uh, but, uh...

2700
02:58:19,380 --> 02:58:25,640
Honestly, I highly, highly recommend buying this game.

2701
02:58:25,920 --> 02:58:30,460
Cause, like, I've never been so hyped over a new...

2702
02:58:30,460 --> 02:58:31,520
It's been so long.

2703
02:58:31,700 --> 02:58:35,720
It's been so long since the last Dynasty Warriors game.

2704
02:58:36,200 --> 02:58:39,060
And honestly, I am really hooked on this one.

2705
02:58:39,340 --> 02:58:41,820
This one is... it's so good.

2706
02:58:41,820 --> 02:58:46,960
I think they really, really went beyond, uh, beyond for this one.

2707
02:58:47,360 --> 02:58:49,500
Like, I'm... yeah, it's... oh my god.

2708
02:58:49,960 --> 02:58:55,860
Um, the story... I think, like, the voice acting and the story and, like, how they did the combat.

2709
02:58:56,540 --> 02:59:01,960
And, uh, and just everything about it so far, I'm enjoying it a lot.

2710
02:59:02,220 --> 02:59:06,620
And, like, seeing all the characters be re... like, all the new redesigns.

2711
02:59:06,700 --> 02:59:10,800
It's funny and also, like, I like some of the new character redesigns.

2712
02:59:10,800 --> 02:59:13,580
But it's also funny to see them so young.

2713
02:59:13,800 --> 02:59:16,020
Like, I'm pretty sure they're gonna age them up.

2714
02:59:16,060 --> 02:59:16,940
There's no way.

2715
02:59:17,320 --> 02:59:20,260
They're not gonna give Tao Tao his fucking mustache.

2716
02:59:20,580 --> 02:59:21,620
There's no way.

2717
02:59:21,900 --> 02:59:25,800
So I'm pretty sure they're gonna, like, age them up as we go.

2718
02:59:25,980 --> 02:59:27,860
And I'm, like, I'm super excited.

2719
02:59:28,040 --> 02:59:31,220
I'm really, really excited to see what they look like the longer you play.

2720
02:59:31,720 --> 02:59:38,800
Um, um, and, uh, and yeah, I'm enjoying... I'm definitely...

2721
02:59:38,800 --> 02:59:40,380
Yeah, being so... it did.

2722
02:59:40,480 --> 02:59:41,180
It gave me whiplash.

2723
02:59:41,300 --> 02:59:42,620
I was like, oh my god.

2724
02:59:42,700 --> 02:59:45,720
I was like, I was like, where's your mustache?

2725
02:59:46,480 --> 02:59:48,700
Where did it... oh my god.

2726
02:59:48,960 --> 02:59:50,280
Where did it go?

2727
02:59:52,760 --> 02:59:57,060
Um, but, um, but yeah, it's been really fun so far.

2728
02:59:57,140 --> 03:00:01,600
And I really, really highly recommend you guys to check out the game if you... and play it yourself.

2729
03:00:02,320 --> 03:00:03,960
And, uh, I love it.

2730
03:00:03,980 --> 03:00:04,800
I love it so much.

2731
03:00:04,840 --> 03:00:06,200
I really do love it so far.

2732
03:00:06,200 --> 03:00:08,480
Uh, we're gonna play... play Duel Part 2.

2733
03:00:08,680 --> 03:00:09,640
I won't finish this game.

2734
03:00:09,700 --> 03:00:13,120
I actually legitimately, uh...

2735
03:00:13,120 --> 03:00:17,180
I legitimately really want to finish this game because I... I like it a lot.

2736
03:00:17,380 --> 03:00:23,380
And I would... I would have played this a lot longer if I didn't have a livestream tomorrow.

2737
03:00:23,780 --> 03:00:24,120
Um...

2738
03:00:25,360 --> 03:00:30,520
If I didn't have a livestream tomorrow, I would have... I would have kept... I would have kept playing.

2739
03:00:30,520 --> 03:00:31,020
Uh...

2740
03:00:34,920 --> 03:00:35,200
Um...

2741
03:00:35,200 --> 03:00:35,680
Uh...

2742
03:00:36,260 --> 03:00:37,260
SRO, thank you for the superchat.

2743
03:00:37,320 --> 03:00:37,940
Thank you, thank you.

2744
03:00:38,020 --> 03:00:39,260
Hello, Doki, please play more.

2745
03:00:39,360 --> 03:00:40,380
Yes, I will, definitely.

2746
03:00:40,740 --> 03:00:41,380
Thank you for the superchat.

2747
03:00:41,500 --> 03:00:42,040
Thank you, thank you.

2748
03:00:42,140 --> 03:00:43,300
Anton, thank you for the superchat.

2749
03:00:43,440 --> 03:00:44,280
Thank you, thank you.

2750
03:00:44,620 --> 03:00:46,760
Doki, it's me, Anton, from China.

2751
03:00:47,020 --> 03:00:49,960
Everything is on fire, but I still think the dynasty can be saved.

2752
03:00:50,380 --> 03:00:50,660
Definitely.

2753
03:00:50,860 --> 03:00:52,200
Thank you for the superchat, Anton.

2754
03:00:52,400 --> 03:00:52,700
Thank you.

2755
03:00:52,840 --> 03:00:54,120
Thank you from Han, China.

2756
03:00:55,360 --> 03:00:56,380
Marcello, thank you for the superchat.

2757
03:00:56,500 --> 03:00:57,060
Thank you, thank you.

2758
03:00:57,060 --> 03:01:01,640
Not Doki, thanks for saving my village from the tyranny of the Yellow Turbans.

2759
03:01:01,860 --> 03:01:06,160
Here is a meager offering I got from the still-warm bodies of my family.

2760
03:01:06,640 --> 03:01:08,780
Thank you for the superchat, Marcello.

2761
03:01:08,860 --> 03:01:09,860
Thank you, thank you.

2762
03:01:10,020 --> 03:01:14,040
I knew I still had some superchats from ancient China.

2763
03:01:14,200 --> 03:01:14,880
I knew it.

2764
03:01:15,460 --> 03:01:17,060
Nexy, thank you for the superchat.

2765
03:01:17,220 --> 03:01:17,820
Thank you, thank you.

2766
03:01:18,100 --> 03:01:20,180
Dear Not Doki, I think you're neat.

2767
03:01:20,320 --> 03:01:21,880
From your biggest fan.

2768
03:01:21,960 --> 03:01:23,600
Thank you for the superchat.

2769
03:01:23,800 --> 03:01:24,960
Thank you, thank you.

2770
03:01:26,360 --> 03:01:27,360
Alright, guys.

2771
03:01:27,620 --> 03:01:29,560
I'm gonna call it here, everybody.

2772
03:01:29,980 --> 03:01:32,080
It's been a really fun game.

2773
03:01:33,080 --> 03:01:35,900
Arsateria, thank you for your third superchat.

2774
03:01:35,980 --> 03:01:36,840
Thank you, thank you.

2775
03:01:37,080 --> 03:01:40,220
Nothing bad with Cookie Kratos again, Doki.

2776
03:01:40,440 --> 03:01:42,820
We're gonna finish God of War tomorrow!

2777
03:01:43,100 --> 03:01:45,240
We're gonna finish it, I believe in us.

2778
03:01:45,640 --> 03:01:48,720
We're also gonna have a special announcement at the beginning of the stream for God of War.

2779
03:01:48,820 --> 03:01:52,140
So please tune in to that stream if you wanna know what the special announcement is.

2780
03:01:52,420 --> 03:01:53,060
Thank you, everybody.

2781
03:01:53,280 --> 03:01:53,960
I'm gonna call it here.

2782
03:01:53,960 --> 03:01:54,960
I'm gonna rest my voice.

2783
03:01:55,320 --> 03:01:57,240
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

2784
03:01:57,500 --> 03:01:58,000
Posture check.

2785
03:01:58,260 --> 03:02:00,180

2789
03:02:06,680 --> 03:02:07,400
Bye, guys.
