1
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,420
Guys, oh, this is not good.

2
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:12,860
Okay, wait, okay, okay, we're okay, okay, we're okay, I was like, wait, why am I not moving, oh no, oh no, wait, what is this game even called, it's called B1, it's called B1, okay, I was like, what the fuck is this game called, okay, B1, okay, guys, yeah,

3
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,040
so, I was like, yeah!

4
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,680
And I was like, oh no, wait, shader compilation in progress, what do you mean?

5
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:37,240
Alright, so yes, the reason why I did not start stream right away is that, um, it was apparently, I preloaded it, I literally preloaded it, like, the moment I woke up, and, and then, like, it was unpacking and everything, so that's why I was taking a while,

6
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:55,840
and I had to restart stream to activate the game, because even though it was exactly 7pm, it didn't activate until I restarted my stream, and now, now we're waiting for the shader, the shader compilation in progress, but I'm super excited, I'm, I'm so fucking excited to play this game on launch,

7
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:11,080
um, I remember we've been following the progress of, uh, Shroom Hong, or, like, uh, Wukong, for, or Black Myth Wukong, for, like, a very long time now, um, Israel, well, thank you for the 20 gifted ships, thank you, thank you, we've seen so many trailers,

8
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,780
and everything, and, uh, Journey to the West, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

9
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,720
and, and, and This is the first sentence.

10
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,860
And this is the first sentence.

11
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,760
And this is the first sentence.

12
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,080
This is the first sentence.

13
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,000
And this is the first sentence.

14
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,560
And this is the first sentence.

15
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,220
This is the first sentence.

16
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:35,220
And this is the first sentence.

17
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,940
And this is the first sentence.

18
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,560
This is the first sentence.

19
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,360
And this is the first sentence.

20
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,320
And this is the first sentence.

21
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,360
Dynasty Warriors.

22
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:27,260
We have Dynasty Warriors for Romance of the Three Kingdoms, but I feel like I've never seen an actual, like, good video game or, like, any types of video game adaptations of this literature.

23
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:39,340
And I was actually really scared because, you know, during, like, the final trailer reveals, there wasn't really much gameplay trailers, so I was super scared.

24
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,320
I was like, oh no, I haven't seen any gameplay trailers.

25
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,460
Recently, of this game.

26
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,220
So, it's like, it's just like, oh no.

27
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,480
Oh no, this is mean, is it gonna be good?

28
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,360
Is it?

29
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:09,420
So, I'm really happy to find out that the reviews for it was really, because I saw the reviews for it, and the reviews has been very positive.

30
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,940
So, that's great.

31
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,240
I'm so happy that the reviews have been very positive.

32
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,960
So far.

33
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,440
And, uh, and I'm definitely looking forward to trying it out.

34
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,680
It's got, like, 8 out of 10 to 10 out of 10.

35
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,240
Um, it's generally very favorable reviews.

36
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:35,260
The only critiques I saw was, like, gameplay-wise was, uh, was the fact that, um, it does get a little bit repetitive in the end.

37
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,360
Um, so, is there...

38
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,040
So, like, uh, I heard that, um, this game, because this game was originally...

39
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,700
It was, like, made, animated in Chinese, like, the lip-syncing.

40
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,780
So, like, I wonder if it...

41
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,140
Oh, I cannot read that.

42
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:52,540
Like...

43
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,020
But I don't want to read.

44
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,920
So, like...

45
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,300
I know, like, the lip-syncing was originally for Chinese, but, like, I don't want to read.

46
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,320
I don't want to...

47
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,100
I want them to tell me what to do.

48
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,580
I don't want to, like, hear...

49
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,840
Like, I don't want...

50
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,920
I don't want them to, like, make me read the instructions.

51
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:25,860
I can understand, like, bits and pieces, but, like, I'm really bad at, like, complicated words.

52
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,480
Like...

53
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,140
I'm not meant to, like, understand, like, the actual, like, like, hard words.

54
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,880
And Journey to the West has a lot of text, I assume, because the story itself is very complicated.

55
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,720
Like, not...

56
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,720
I don't want to say very complicated, but...

57
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,380
Whoa!

58
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,040
Don't worry, I'm gonna...

59
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,960
I'm gonna fix the settings when we're in there.

60
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,940
When we're...

61
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,820
Okay, it might look...

62
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,300
Look a little fucked right now, but don't worry.

63
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,660
We're gonna fix the settings when I'm in.

64
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,160
We're almost there.

65
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,600
I can't fix it yet.

66
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,060
I'm not in yet.

67
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,720
It's still loading.

68
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,420
Oh.

69
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,060
Oh!

70
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,480
Oh my god, he's...

71
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,760
There he is!

72
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,960
I was gonna say...

73
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,020
There he is!

74
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,340
He's so handsome, but I'm like...

75
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:15,980
But he's monkey!

76
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,820
He...

77
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,620
He is...

78
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,340
He is a good-looking monkey.

79
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,480
Okay, let me...

80
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Plug in my controller.

81
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,940
Why is it not registering my controller?

82
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,680
Oh, there it is.

83
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,080
Okay.

84
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,580
Alright, gameplay.

85
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,580
Tutorial.

86
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,380
Autolock.

87
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,260
Camera assist.

88
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,000
Show headgear.

89
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,360
Uh...

90
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,420
Damage numbers.

91
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,940
Enemy health bar.

92
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,440
Boss.

93
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,180
Okay.

94
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,460
Uh...

95
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,140
Camera.

96
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's see.

97
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,560
I'm gonna turn that down, just in case.

98
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,780
Uh...

99
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,540
Language.

100
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,240
Display.

101
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:56,920
Okay.

102
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,680
Uh...

103
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,580
I feel like...

104
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:00,780
Okay.

105
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,480
Borderless.

106
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,080
Automatic.

107
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,220
Frame rate.

108
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,720
Cap.

109
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,800
Let's get to 120, just in case.

110
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,860
Motion blur is strong!

111
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,620
Oh, no camera shake, please.

112
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,040
I am not here for that camera shake.

113
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,440
Okay.

114
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:13,900
Super.

115
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,500
Super resolution.

116
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,880
And improve full ray tra...

117
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,780
Cinematic.

118
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,420
Cinematic.

119
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,420
Wait, what?

120
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,020
What's cinematic?

121
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,500
Is cinematic, like, extreme?

122
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,460
Uh...

123
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,820
Is that...

124
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,640
Keep that...

125
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,580
Yeah, keep that motion blur out of there.

126
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,280
Absolute...

127
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
Is that ultra?

128
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,680
Oh, but, like, I don't know.

129
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,540
We'll do...

130
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,580
We'll do, like, very high.

131
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,740
Yeah, but, like, I don't know if...

132
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,640
Like, my PC can handle cinematic.

133
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:45,820
I...

134
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,500
I heard that, like, it's not very well optimized.

135
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,420
So, I rather...

136
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,100
I rather not risk it.

137
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,700
Look.

138
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,000
Look, all I'm saying is that in, like, the literature, he's, like, the most handsome monkey in...

139
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,000
He's the most handsome monkey...

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,640
He, like...

141
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,220
He begs so many ladies!

142
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,480
He had so many girlfriends!

143
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,460
He had...

144
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,540
Human girlfriends!

145
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,860
So...

146
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,600
He had human girlfriends!

147
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,360
You can't say that!

148
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,940
And the literature in all the video adaptations!

149
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,780
Apply.

150
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,480
We'll do high, just in case.

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,480
Uh...

152
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,300
Sound...

153
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,240
Accessibility...

154
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,480
Okay, that should be good.

155
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,260
All right.

156
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,240
I did do the benchmark test, but then, like, it was really hard to actually figure out if it did do anything.

157
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,860
So...

158
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,320
All right, let me turn it up in advance.

159
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,660
All right, here we go!

160
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,280
New journey!

161
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,860
We're going to return to Monkey!

162
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,440
Whoa!

163
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,340
Look at him.

164
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,070
I'm pretty sure he described how terrifying the literature to a point people thought he was a demon.

165
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,310
Yeah, but why does he have so many human girlfriends?

166
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,970
Huh?

167
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,090
Even goddesses wanted to bang that monkey!

168
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,650
Even the goddesses wanted to be some action with that monkey.

169
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,130
They wanted to return a monkey

170
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:41,050
Whoa He had the monkey riz

171
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,550
Oh, that looks so cool.

172
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,350
Oh my gosh.

173
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,330
Wait, this graphics was really good even on high

174
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:09,290
Of course you fucking hated the gods There's a reason why he got like he's going to the West cuz he has to learn his lesson Cuz he was a cocky little bitch

175
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,800
All right, oh that's a lot of people

176
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,000

00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,600
Don't worry.

245
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,060
Oh!

246
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:09,460

Alright, that's right.

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,220
Oh, never mind.

252
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,160
Alright.

253
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:17,940
We're fine.

Alright.

00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:22,780
Haha!

256
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,420
That's right!

257
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,660
That's not the real me!

258
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,260
That's fucking right!

259
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,260
Alright.

260
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,520

You got cutscene buff!

The celestial court welcomes you, foul monkey, yet you remain untamed.

263
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,460
That's right.

264

You can't stop me!

267
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,100
Dear brother, your edge is on me.

268
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,340

269
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,140

Wait, that's not fair.

275
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,380
What's he gonna do?

276
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,240
That's right.

277
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,140
Oh, that's what he's gonna- Wait, but it went stone for him!

278
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,620
Oh, I'm gonna die!

279
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,580
Hahaha!

280
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,400
Wait!

281
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,900
Oh no.

282
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,500
Oh no.

283
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,940
Guys, it's not good.

284
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,020
It's not looking good.

285
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,720
I'm literally so c- Wait, where is my HP?

286

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,500
You have fucking HP.

292
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,600

293
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,380
Hahaha!

You know what I mean?

302
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,920
Master Keeper's not that bad.

303
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,860
Hahaha!

304
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,860
Never punished!

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,820
I can never lose!

306
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,640
Jeez.

307
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,360
I love the- I love the music.

308
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,500
The music is so good.

309
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,000
The music is so good.

310
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,720
The music is

311
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:31,690
so good.

312
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,110
They touched this!

313
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,110
Brother!

314
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,430
What if we touch that?

315
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,100
Jesus Christ.

316
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,260
Why don't the big guys just step on him?

317
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,400
Why don't the big guys just step on him?

318
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,720
Foul monkey!

319
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,180
Taste my axe!

320
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,580
That's like a million dead people right there.

321
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,980
For just one monkey?

322
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,780
You call that a deal?

323
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,940
The glare up here is dazzling.

324
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,940
Fight me in the woods if you have the guts.

325
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,620
Lol, he missed.

326
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,440
Hahaha!

Hahaha!

328
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,800
Imagine missing.

329
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,680
Hahaha!

330
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,210
What the fuck did I hit?

331
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:44,850
No!

332
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,350
Not the fucking bike!

333
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,190
How did he- How did you hit me?

334
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,310
No!

335
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,350
My powers!

336
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,130
That's illegal!

337
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,270
Not the crowd!

338
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:02,990
Oh my god!

339
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:07,750
The- The anti-cheat!

340
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,710
Hahaha!

341
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,270
Hahaha!

342
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,870
Oh my god!

343
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,870
They caught me!

344
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,850
They realized I was hacking!

345
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,690
They put anti-cheat!

346
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:20,970
Hahaha!

347
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,390
The anti-cheat kicked in.

348
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:26,710
The anti-cheat kicked in.

349
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:27,770
Hahaha!

350
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,330
A hero.

351
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,950
A battle eye!

352
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,550
Above all else.

353
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,610
Buddhahood he attained, yes.

354
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:42,030
But- He found the celestial rules.

355
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,510
For he yearned to come back.

356
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,090
And to revel in the simple joys with us.

357
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,050
And to revel in the simple joys with us.

358
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,770
That was a great game!

359
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,390
Wow!

360
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:54,570
And then Wukong- Wukong got nerfed.

361
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,850
His choice to forgo the life above.

362
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,390
Only fueled their mistrust.

363
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,630
GG!

364
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:03,570
Hahaha!

365
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,550
I was a Wukong main.

366
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:13,670
But then they- he wanted mejor deixado.

367
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,770
He went to another planet.

368
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,630
Because he didn't like anything in there.

369
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,850
He was far more paid to do something ...

370
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,990
about this one.

371
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,110
Like now, I'm gonna play a doncaster.

372
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,950
He accepted that right from the start.

373
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:27,210
In his next turn on the球I am a number 2.

374
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,970
He lost 5% of his pueda 2 exports.

375
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:30,730
This is-

376
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,570
That's insane!

377
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,230
How come some monkeys wear clothes, and some do not?

378
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,310
That's...

379
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,570
Let them be free!

380
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,330
Dr.

381
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,790
Zaius, Dr. Zaius.

382
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,060
Monkey, why are you wearing clothes?

383
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,720
It's restraining you!

384
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,320
Let them be free!

385
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,100
I cannot venture through all the lands.

386
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,480
I cannot.

387
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,830
Yet among you, there might be one who is destined.

388
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,650
Trip the monkey!

389
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,430
They don't need clothes.

390
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,250
They have fur!

391
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,990
Or hair.

392
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:44,490
And upon the return of the relics to Mount Tuago, he may yet rise again.

393
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:48,670
Exactly.

394
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,850
Pants are a prisoner.

395
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,740
Maybe it's a gloofy Pluto sort of difference.

396
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,100
Lord Crows says thank you for the super chat.

397
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,160
Thank you, thank you.

398
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,400
Monkey doesn't need... pants?

399
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,260
Chapter 1, Black Cloud, Red Fire.

400
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,320
I'm actually curious what Wukong sounds like in Chinese.

401
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,660
Because the lip-syncing was originally done for Chinese instead of English dub.

402
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,830
God, that Peach looks... that Peach has fur!

403
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,070
That's some good render.

404
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,510
Is that... that's not a monkey!

405
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,970
You don't need clothes!

406
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,590
You have fur!

407
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,350
Perfect timing.

408
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:01,230
This Peach knew I needed a snack.

409
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:02,850
Oh!

410
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,010
What the fuck?

411
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,410
Oh!

412
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:14,610
Alright.

413
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,470
Give me a sec.

414
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:15,830
Woah!

415
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,390
Give me a sec, wolf guys!

416
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,390
I need to... okay, I need to adjust the settings real quick.

417
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,970
Apparently, you can... adjust...

418
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,810
Okay, you cannot make it better, apparently.

419
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:30,150
Not...

420
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,950
You cannot make the text better, okay.

421
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,810
Alright, that's awkward.

422
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,210
Alright.

423
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,190
Change the... the setting... okay.

424
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,050
Alright, so... speech.

425
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,090
Alright, I'm curious.

426
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,470
Oh yeah.

427
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,850
Oh yeah, the sound effects too.

428
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,470
Let me turn down the sound effects.

429
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:47,530
Alright.

430
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,990
Alright, let me know if that's better, sound guy.

431
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,970
Alright, lock in... oh!

432
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,730
One more thing.

433
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,630
I swear this is the last thing!

434
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,550
I need to change the... the sense.

435
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,270
Where the fuck is the sense?

436
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,050
Okay, there we go.

437
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:10,310
Controller... balance... 4... 3... there we go.

438
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,230
That should be better now.

439
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:14,890
Nice.

440
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,190
That was easy.

441
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,210
Look at you.

442
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,050
Oh my god, this is giving me, like, nostalgia.

443
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,630
The voice acting.

444
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,870
Holy shit.

445
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,830
Okay, shift to run.

446
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,050
Ooh, berries.

447
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,170
Those are some weak-ass wolves.

448
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:39,950
I know, right?

449
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,850
Get outta here, wolves.

450
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:49,090
Oh, I got stone spirit and a tiny piece of gold.

451
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,230
Guys, I cannot keep it Chinese, guys.

452
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,450
I'll have to start reading later.

453
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,070
If I keep it Chinese.

454
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:02,610
If I don't understand something, I have to read.

455
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,270
And I don't know if I like that.

456
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:04,990
Oh.

457
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:08,690
Hold to charge and build up the focus.

458
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,750
Hold heavy attack to charge.

459
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,630
Charging costs stamina, but quickly builds.

460
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:13,530
Okay.

461
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,670
Boom!

462
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:18,930
Alright.

463
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:21,690
Nice.

464
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,170
I wanna hear, I wanna hear Shroom Hong talk!

465
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,930
Let me hear him talk!

466
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,170
Stop being so stoic!

467
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,210
Alright.

468
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,390
See, open.

469
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,170
Rainbows, thank you for the super chat.

470
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:41,850
Thank you, thank you.

471
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:42,770
You said you don't read.

472
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:43,330
Exactly!

473
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,030
And that is why I don't play.

474
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,610
I cannot play it in full Chinese.

475
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,470
Because then I'll be like...

476
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,610
Because then I actually have to read.

477
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,420
Oh, yeah.

478
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,340
Oh.

479
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,020
Is that like the checkpoint?

480
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,880
Wait.

481
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,460
Oh, he has a fucking back scratcher!

482
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,320
Oh my god.

483
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,560
That's when you know he's old, old.

484
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,380
He's so itchy.

485
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,480
Grandpa, is that you?

486
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,080
Okay.

487
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,040
Oh...

488
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,520
Hi,

489
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:13,660
Grandpa.

490
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,180
Oh, nice.

491
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,940
More wolves?

492
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,480
Don't worry, I'll beat your ass.

493
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,460
Goodbye, Grandpa!

494
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,820
I gotta backtrack.

495
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,360
How can they be tough?

496
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,180
Alright, offer incense.

497
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,700
What is this?

498
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,280
Are these upgrades or bonfire?

499
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,020
Oh!

500
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,660
Collect gifts.

501
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,360
Oh yeah!

502
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,500
I bought the deluxe!

503
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,480
That's right!

504
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,960
Pay to win!

505
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,840
That's fucking right.

506
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,880
Yeah, I'm pay to win.

507
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,000
Where is it?

508
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,600
Oh yeah, I am pay to win.

509
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,680
Yeah, that's right.

510
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,840
14 defense.

511
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,960
Let's fucking go.

512
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,640
Oh yeah, slightly increased movement speed.

513
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,640
That's what I like to see.

514
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,080
Pay to win!

515
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,500
Oh, but his hat's so... Okay, let me...

516
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,020
I need to turn off the hat.

517
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,740
Oh, I don't like the hat.

518
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,260
I know you can turn it off.

519
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,100
Okay, we're gonna put English until he fucking talks.

520
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,240
The monkey isn't talking!

521
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,100
Donkey man!

522
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,480
No, I wanna see his face!

523
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,940
I know you can make it so you can see his face!

524
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,320
Alright, helmet.

525
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,460
Where the fuck's the helmet?

526
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,300
Oh, show headgear.

527
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:42,900
Okay, off.

528
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,420
Pay to win time.

529
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,500
Alright.

530
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,540
The English voice acting is actually surprisingly very...

531
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:55,980
It's pretty decent.

532
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,020
Like, it's very, like, similar to the Chinese.

533
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,980
Pay to win, but...

534
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,120
Zachary, thank you for the super chat.

535
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,980
Thank you, thank you!

536
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,140
Alright, let's see.

537
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,480
Hello, wolf.

538
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,400
You have a shield?

539
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,260
Shield's not gonna help you!

540
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,200
I have a long-ass pole!

541
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:15,900
Oh, shit!

542
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,960
Guys, I think the shield helped him.

543
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,540
Oh, no!

544
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,040
No!

545
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:20,860
Okay.

546
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,920
I need to lock in.

547
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,380
There we go.

548
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,260
That's fucking right.

549
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,320
Shield doesn't help you.

550
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:25,880
Help Jack.

551
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,160
Jack shit.

552
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,220
Okay.

553
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,040
No talk.

554
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,640
Only monkey.

555
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,040
That's fucking right.

556
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,280
What's the axe gonna do?

557
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,300
Oh, sorry.

558
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,540
I keep forgetting to lock in.

559
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,960
That's fucking right.

560
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,340
Oh!

561
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,340
That's what the axe is gonna do.

562
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,380
Don't worry.

563
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,080
I charge up.

564
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,180
Thank you for watching me charge it up.

565
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:46,720
Shield.

566
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,400
Yeah, that's right.

567
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,200
Shield versus pay to win staff.

568
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,600
That's right.

569
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,580
I don't like how there's no compass.

570
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,160
Guys, I'm a little bit worried because there's no compass.

571
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,000
And I feel like I won't know where to go soon.

572
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,720
All right.

573
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,300
Nice.

574
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:07,920
Oh, hey!

575
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,120
There's a big guy over there.

576
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,340
Surely, he's not gonna fucking kill me, right?

577
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:12,920
Oh!

578
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,660
All right.

579
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,440
Never mind.

580
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,520
All right.

581
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,160
Cat guy.

582
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:16,520
Okay.

583
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,060
Bull guard.

584
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,440
All right.

585
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,420
Oh!

586
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,320
How the fuck?

587
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,420
That's illegal.

588
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,000
Are you serious?

589
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,590
Guys, I think he killed me.

590
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,930
But I paid a win!

591
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,850
Is that possible?

592
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,950
I paid a win!

593
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,570
Okay.

594
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,210
I believe they should be respawning, right?

595
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,990
Just like Dark Souls?

596
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,690
You didn't even get it.

597
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,350
Thank you for the akasupa.

598
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:01,950
Thank you.

599
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:02,270
Thank you.

600
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,190
He's like three times my size!

601
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,990
Like, what the fuck was I supposed to do?

602
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,910
He's three times my size!

603
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:18,590
I wonder, like, if, like, my XP is, like, there or some shit.

604
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,390
It's not fair!

605
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,030
The anti-cheat got me!

606
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,290
I got...

607
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,710
My main account got VAC banned!

608
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,610
It's not fair!

609
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,130
My main account got VAC banned!

610
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,710
What was I supposed to do?

611
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,690
I have to restart from zero on a new account!

612
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,430
Okay.

613
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:47,350
All my money and gold and assets were...

614
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:48,370
Oh, shit!

615
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:51,850
Damn.

616
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:54,830
Don't understand!

617
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,930
Oh, shit!

618
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,210
Okay.

619
00:34:59,330 --> 00:34:59,850
Nice.

620
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,470
I dodged it.

621
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:01,950
Okay.

622
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:03,610
Nice.

623
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:04,250
Oh!

624
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,210
Okay.

625
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,970
I'm gonna do some hard attacks here.

626
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,350
Okay.

627
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,630
This is the same...

628
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,630
Oh, shit!

629
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:11,910
Okay.

630
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:12,930
Oh!

631
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:13,710
Where am I?

632
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,270
Wait!

633
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:15,950
That's cheating!

634
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,810
He has cutscene!

635
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,190
What?

636
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,830
Oh, shit!

637
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,370
Oh, my God!

638
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:29,690
Oh, man!

639
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,270
You did it!

640
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,390
The navigation is simple.

641
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:33,750
Just...

642
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,690
Just head west.

643
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,910
Thank you for the super chat, Zane!

644
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,110
Thank you!

645
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:37,510
Thank you, thank you!

646
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,550
Thank you, old man!

647
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:49,830
Oh!

648
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:51,770
I'm gonna have the ability!

649
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,230
Oh!

650
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:53,550
I'm gonna have the ability!

651
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:53,750
Oh!

652
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,110
Oh!

653
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:54,230
Oh!

654
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,130
Oh!

655
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,010
Oh!

656
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:57,750
Oh!

657
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:58,570
Oh!

658
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,290
Immobilize!

659
00:35:59,410 --> 00:35:59,810
Oh, my God!

660
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:00,030
Guys!

661
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,430
I'm slowly getting back my main!

662
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:11,850
Should you come across any miscreants, just point your finger at them and release this spell.

663
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:16,850
You'll be able to hold them in place while giving yourself a...

664
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,050
I got the monkey paw!

665
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,810
Sadly, mine is but a humble trick.

666
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,190
Yeah, who would lose to this guy?

667
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,430
It couldn't be me.

668
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,750
Oh shit!

669
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,090
Okay, don't worry.

670
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,770
Watch this.

671
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,110
That's fucking right.

672
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:46,770
I missed.

673
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:55,450
Okay, I won't miss a second time.

674
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,950
My pull was so long!

675
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,750
How was I missing?

676
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,370
Oh, my stamina is running out.

677
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:01,990
Fuck!

678
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:02,390
Okay.

679
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:07,850
I need to make sure I have enough stamina too.

680
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,590
Easy.

681
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,790
Missing stationary target.

682
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,890
I don't know what you're talking about.

683
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,430
What if I could explore?

684
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,010
I feel like I won't find my way back.

685
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,930
That's like what I'm scared about.

686
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:29,690
I feel like I'm gonna start exploring and then I'll be like, how do I go back?

687
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,070
Oh, there's a bird!

688
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,130
There's a rabbit!

689
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,610
Oh, I can't kill the rabbit.

690
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:35,730
What are you?

691
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,810
Are you a rat?

692
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,110
Are you scared?

693
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:41,530
Oh, bamboo!

694
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,990
Why are you scared?

695
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,670
Why can't I go down?

696
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,110
Who's this guy?

697
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,730
How do I...

698
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,570
How do I interact with it?

699
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,090
Oh, E.

700
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,500
The form.

701
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,220
The shaka form.

702
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,760
Okay.

703
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,020
Gotta explore it a little bit.

704
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,840
Oh, there's more loot!

705
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,900
Wait, how do I get that?

706
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,700
Give me the loot!

707
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,520
Alright, gather.

708
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,820
The purple Lindsay.

709
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,340
Two more stuff.

710
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,100
Guys, I need you guys to help.

711
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,300
You're my GPS, okay?

712
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,880
So I can go back the right way later.

713
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,080
What are you gonna do about it?

714
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,420
Nothing.

715
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,860
That's fucking right.

716
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,720
You're weak as fuck.

717
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,340
I literally killed a bull guard.

718
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,060
Nice.

719
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,240
Already guarding a plant.

720
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,840
Guys, where's West?

721
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,840
Guys, we need to head to the...

722
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,980
What the fuck is that?

723
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,200
Oh, there's frog people!

724
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,420
Oh.

725
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,260
Get back here.

726
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,140
Get back over here.

727
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,280
You think you can hop away?

728
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,940
New lesser yoga has been recorded.

729
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:54,780
Where are you?

730
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:55,880
Croaky.

731
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,160
Impose a jewel.

732
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,920
Forms unrefined.

733
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,380
Ugly and odd.

734
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,560
Damn.

735
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,880
Voices... Bellies... Damn.

736
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:05,860
Okay.

737
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,860
Two frog-wise practiced in the marshes.

738
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,360
The smaller frog was often bullied.

739
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,280
Yet the bigger frog one always stood up for him.

740
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,260
Instead, they forged a strong friendship.

741
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:22,020
One day, they made a contest held by Law Ikalan to appoint a surgeon among all the frogs.

742
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,700
Guys, I don't...

743
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,740
Guys, just buy Journey to the West.

744
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,620
Guys, this is basically Journey to the West excerpts.

745
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,700
Oh, I love the artwork though.

746
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,260
The wolf swordsman.

747
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,020
Among the wolf guays, there was a young one.

748
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Wolf guay.

749
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,360
There was a young one.

750
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:48,980
Guay!

751
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,980
Oh, it's monster!

752
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,300
I was like, guay.

753
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,080
Guay.

754
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,520
More guay!

755
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,340
That's monster in Chinese.

756
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,200
However, his time spent practicing was short in his skill.

757
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,580
Oh.

758
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,340
Alright, let's see.

759
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,100
I just realized what it meant.

760
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,600
I was like, guay.

761
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:15,860
Guay.

762
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,240
Guay.

763
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,120
More guay.

764
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,880
Self-advanced?

765
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,240
Oh, is this rank up?

766
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,480
Oh, okay.

767
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:26,800
Uh...

768
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,240
Question, should I stream on YouTube or on Twitch?

769
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,160
It will be my first time.

770
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,200
Daniel, thank you for the super chat.

771
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,520
Thank you.

772
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:31,900
Thank you.

773
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,260
Definitely Twitch.

774
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,920
If you're like streaming for the first time.

775
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,040
I don't know what to get.

776
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,400
Literally, the game just came out.

777
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,040
It's like since...

778
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,580
Oh, wait.

779
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,140
I like that.

780
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,260
I like that.

781
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,440
I want extend the immobilize.

782
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,960
Oh my god, there's no meta.

783
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,180
Literally, the game just came out, so there's no meta.

784
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:50,880
I...

785
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,920
It's not fair.

786
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,400
There's no meta.

787
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,260
The game literally just came out.

788
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,300
Increases the health recovery among assuming a focus point.

789
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,700
I like that.

790
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,720
Enables sprinting when charging.

791
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,500
Okay, wait.

792
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:13,960
That's good.

793
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:15,620
Foundations.

794
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,300
Staminy talent.

795
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,800
Reduces the smartly.

796
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,100
Reduces the stamina cost.

797
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,140
Okay, I feel like we got reduced to dodging stamina.

798
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:23,720
All right.

799
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,920
Oh, no.

800
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,160
We're metacrafting now.

801
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,380
We're metacrafting for now.

802
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:31,860
All right.

803
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,240
I wonder what would happen if I put no caps for FPS frames.

804
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,000
Who would that be like?

805
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,560
Who are you?

806
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,660
You don't seem...

807
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,180
Are you a crow?

808
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,520
Oh, it's a crow!

809
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:40,680
Oh, it's a crow!

810
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,760
Oh, shit!

811
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:43,300
Oh!

812
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,640
Give me heals.

813
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,280
I don't...

814
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,720
I have heals.

815
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:46,980
Okay.

816
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,280
Nice.

817
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,560
Okay.

818
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,100
Okay.

819
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,720
Increase the duration if I use this.

820
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,420
Oh, fuck!

821
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,840
That's not fair!

822
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,000
He has the strong legs!

823
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,920
He's so fast!

824
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,200
Okay.

825
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,680
Oh!

826
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,900
How does he hit me from there?

827
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,380
It's okay.

828
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,080
I'll just L1 it.

829
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,260
Oh, please.

830
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:10,660
Oh, shit!

831
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:10,860
Drink.

832
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,020
Okay.

833
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:12,800
I still have heals.

834
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,260
That's fucking right!

835
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,040
Oh, shit!

836
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,360
I'll brute force it.

837
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,100
Nice.

838
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,260
I did it.

839
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,100
Wait.

840
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,160
It's a lesser...

841
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,960
It's a lesser monster?

842
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,480
But, like, he's so strong.

843
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,600
But he was so strong.

844
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,620
His stick was longer.

845
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,160
It's not fair.

846
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,320
Okay.

847
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,000
At least I got more willpower now.

848
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:39,940
Is that it?

849
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:40,660
Was that what you wanted?

850
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,120
Is that what he's guarding?

851
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,340
All right.

852
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,900
Learn to dodge?

853
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,400
I don't know the timing for the dodges.

854
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,620
I feel like I thought I timed it correctly, but I haven't learned the dot timing yet.

855
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,620
Don't worry.

856
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,580
If I bash my head against the wall enough times, it'll work.

857
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,540
That's the Doki way.

858
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,680
I'll figure it out!

859
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,000
Guys, I'm lost.

860
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,080
Which way is west?

861
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,200
Just don't get it.

862
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:10,640
Okay.

863
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:14,960
I'm going to try uncapping the frames and see if...

864
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,360
I want to see how that affects my game.

865
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:19,720
All right.

866
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,480
This is it.

867
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,960
This is it.

868
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,880
Now I can't be stopped.

869
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Guys, where's west?

870
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,000
Oh, it looks so much better.

871
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,380
Hole!

872
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,280
Oh, die!

873
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:35,840
There it is!

874
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,280
There it is!

875
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:41,720
Oh, my God.

876
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:42,780
Oh, my God.

877
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,320
We found west.

878
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,060
Guys, we found it!

879
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,760
All right.

880
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,360
Open self-advanced to awaken talents.

881
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,160
Level up to...

882
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,600
Oh, I literally just did that.

883
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,740
That has to be the level up stuff.

884
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,600
There shouldn't be any motion blur.

885
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,940
I turn it off.

886
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,180
That's right.

887
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:04,580
That's right.

888
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,460
No praying for you.

889
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,080
I need your XP.

890
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,840
I need willpower.

891
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:11,900
All right.

892
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:12,740
That's it.

893
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,060
That's right.

894
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,160
No praying for you either.

895
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,720
I need to consume your will.

896
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:18,740
That's right.

897
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,540
Don't worry.

898
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,540
You're just going to have to...

899
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:22,980
Don't worry.

900
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,400
Hell's not that bad.

901
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,920
I couldn't scatter this.

902
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,080
Wow, you disturbed his prayer.

903
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,240
Look, I saw some juicy XP in him.

904
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,040
All right.

905
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,400
Let's go this way.

906
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,120
Oh.

907
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,180
Is that more XP?

908
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,000
Hello.

909
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,820
Hello, frog guy.

910
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:43,840
Oh, shit.

911
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,600
You have a friend.

912
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,120
Oh, you had...

913
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,620
Oh, I forgot to heal.

914
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,960
You had a friend.

915
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,780
Now you'll both see each other in hell.

916
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,400
All right.

917
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,000
See?

918
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,080
It's not that bad.

919
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,080
I need to find a shrine.

920
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,160
An incense shrine.

921
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,880
Oh, there it is.

922
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,520
Is that a shrine?

923
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,560
No.

924
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,260
That's just...

925
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,220
Is that...

926
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:07,680
What is that?

927
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,980
That's just decoration.

928
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,040
Okay.

929
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,560
God damn it.

930
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:14,800
All right.

931
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:17,920
Wait.

932
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,920
There's more stuff there.

933
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,180
Wait.

934
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,320
Did I miss the items?

935
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:21,460
Oh.

936
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,280
Lily pad.

937
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,040
I'll figure out what these items will do one day.

938
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,580
Oh, I don't have heals.

939
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,140
Wait.

940
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:27,780
Is that poison?

941
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:28,780
Oh, that was poison.

942
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:29,800
I was...

943
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,260
I was in the swamp.

944
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,120
No.

945
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,120
No.

946
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:33,780
Please.

947
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:34,420
Please.

948
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,200
Thank you.

949
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:35,700
No.

950
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,260
I didn't realize.

951
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,040
I was like...

952
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,580
Why am I glowing green?

953
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,280
Why?

954
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:40,980
Why am I glowing green?

955
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,260
I didn't realize.

956
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,300
I didn't...

957
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,660
I didn't realize.

958
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,440
I was like...

959
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,000
Wow.

960
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,960
I wonder why I'm glowing green, guys.

961
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:52,440
I...

962
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,340
I...

963
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,640
No.

964
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,660
I was like...

965
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,260
Uh oh.

966
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,000
Stinky.

967
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,040
No.

968
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,220
No.

969
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:10,960
I was like...

970
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,180
Oh!

971
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,260
I can't believe it!

972
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,340
They have poisonous swans?!

973
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,080
No!

974
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:18,960
No!

975
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,080
I can't believe they have poins...

976
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,340
I'm just gonna run past this.

977
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,060
Fuck this.

978
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,940
Gosh, this is stinky.

979
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,180
I couldn't tell.

980
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,900
I'm just like...

981
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,880
Oh, hey, I'm glowing green right now.

982
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,280
Surely that's not a bad thing, right?

983
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,300
I can't believe it.

984
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:40,940
Why am I glowing green?

985
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:44,440
We can't... It's alright, I gotta ruin their prayer yet again.

986
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:46,780
That's right.

987
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,060
Fuck the gods.

988
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,320
Alright, nice.

989
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,080
Alright.

990
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,800
At least I don't lose anything.

991
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,700
There's like... I feel like there's no cons...

992
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,240
Okay, we're not going back to the swamp.

993
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,660
I've learned my lesson.

994
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:03,700
At least there's like no consequences to... to dying.

995
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,280
Yeah, that green is go!

996
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:10,060
Why do you think green is not go?

997
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,580
Alright, let's see.

998
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,160
You can curse whenever you want, Daniel.

999
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,500
Thank you for the super chat.

1000
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,300
Thank you, thank you.

1001
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:23,620
Alright.

1002
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:29,020
I feel like... I feel like I haven't lost anything from dying.

1003
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,600
Like, is there any punishment other than...

1004
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,240
Yeah, green means good!

1005
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,040
Like, what's the point of teaching me that green...

1006
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,400
Look, willpower is green!

1007
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,240
Do I even like lose anything?

1008
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,220
Oh, there you go.

1009
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:44,920
Thank god.

1010
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,280
Your incense.

1011
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,720
I feel like I didn't lose anything from dying.

1012
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:52,540
Dignity!

1013
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,660
Okay, other than that.

1014
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,700
Other than my dignity.

1015
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,060
Yeah, you don't lose anything from dying.

1016
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,980
Green is also HP!

1017
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:12,650
I'm meditating.

1018
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:22,130
That's not incense.

1019
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:23,170
What did I get though?

1020
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:23,850
Sparks.

1021
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:24,110
Oh!

1022
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,150
What the fuck is sparks?

1023
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:30,330
I can't go down.

1024
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:30,810
Okay.

1025
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:32,890
What the fuck is sparks?

1026
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:37,010
Oh, level up.

1027
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:37,530
Oh, okay.

1028
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:38,650
That's the level up.

1029
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:39,190
Alright.

1030
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:45,810
Make each initial dodge more agile and flexible.

1031
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:51,050
Increases... Okay, I feel like we definitely need stamina.

1032
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:53,890
Staff spin?

1033
00:48:55,030 --> 00:49:01,350
Moving forward while using staff spin initiates mobile spin around...

1034
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:02,590
Oh, it deflects projectiles.

1035
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:03,090
That's defense.

1036
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,770
We're not here for that.

1037
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,070
It increases the engaged...

1038
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:07,210
Oh!

1039
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,970
I like distance!

1040
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:11,390
Guys, we're not here to defend.

1041
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:14,970
Alright.

1042
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:17,090
We don't need defense.

1043
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,630
I have a longer staff now.

1044
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:23,130
Alright, is there anything here?

1045
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:23,650
Alright, see?

1046
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:24,930
That's green.

1047
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:26,450
Will is green.

1048
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:28,750
Alright, in I go.

1049
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:31,330
Ooh.

1050
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:33,650
Oh my god!

1051
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,170
The game was like, you're taking too long.

1052
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,190
So here's like a guide.

1053
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,070
Thank you, game.

1054
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,610
Thank you, video game.

1055
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:41,810
You know what I wanted.

1056
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:43,190
Alright.

1057
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,730
We lit another bonfire.

1058
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:50,130
Rest.

1059
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:51,410
Fully restores.

1060
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,030
Self-advance.

1061
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,150
Oh, you want to use in combat?

1062
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:57,950
Reunite the sparks?

1063
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:58,830
What is that?

1064
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:00,010
Oh!

1065
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,430
You get to reset your thing!

1066
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:03,910
Oh!

1067
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,730
So like, if you don't like it, you can reset everything.

1068
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,730
And then there's obviously gonna be more stamina.

1069
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:09,570
And then there's gonna be more spells in the future.

1070
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:10,670
There's stores?

1071
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:12,910
Who am I buying this from?

1072
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:14,730
Evil repellent.

1073
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:16,510
Upon using, it increases damage.

1074
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:18,170
Yarn.

1075
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,350
By day, they patrol the hills.

1076
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,090
By night, they spin their yarns.

1077
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:23,570
Such is the life of Lesser Iguais.

1078
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:25,250
They're hard to earn yarns.

1079
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,630
Okay, so that's for crafting.

1080
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:30,250
And then this is for medicine.

1081
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,470
So this is how I'm gonna make medicine.

1082
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:34,410
But how do I like...

1083
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:36,910
Oh, and then I can sell my gold.

1084
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:38,710
Can I sell my gold?

1085
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:39,310
Yeah.

1086
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:41,250
I guess I'll sell my gold.

1087
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:41,530
Uhh...

1088
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,180
Okay.

1089
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:48,540
So then that means I can sell my gold here.

1090
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,240
I guess I'll just sell all my gold, right?

1091
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,560
Because this is the keepers shrine.

1092
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,220
Right guys.

1093
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,720
Is this the Keeper Shrine?

1094
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:02,900
Uh...

1095
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,400
Yeah,

1096
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,960
all right, I'll just sell all of this.

1097
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,580
I was worried that I'm not at the right shrine, all right?

1098
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,120
Probably you're right.

1099
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,940
We're all experiencing this at the same time.

1100
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,120
I forgot today's launch day, guys.

1101
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,860
Like, nobody knows what's going on.

1102
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:28,920
You know what?

1103
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:29,480
Fuck it.

1104
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,360
Surely, surely it won't be... This is the shrine.

1105
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,460
Surely.

1106
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:37,840
No.

1107
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,720
I can't.

1108
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,380
There's no way.

1109
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,920
There's no way this isn't.

1110
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,700
Surely I didn't fuck it up.

1111
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,260
Okay.

1112
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:48,860
This has to be it.

1113
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,920
We're doing it for science.

1114
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,240
Wait, why did you sell your gold?

1115
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,620
That's not the key for shrine.

1116
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:00,620
Go ahead.

1117
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:05,500
Let me transform you into a golden cicada.

1118
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,900
So you may follow the fires ahead.

1119
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,000
Scout this mountain unnoticed...

1120
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:12,920
Monkey want to fight.

1121
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,720
Monkey don't want be no pussy cicada.

1122
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:16,620
No!

1123
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:19,540
No!

1124
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,360
Now all we we're gonna do is wanna fuck now.

1125
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,400
That's why... that's... you know...

1126
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,460
You know that's why comin...

1127
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,500
The cicadas scream, right?

1128
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:34,640
Because they are telling the whole world that it's the season.

1129
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,600
What happened?

1130
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,160
Okay, I just need to...

1131
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,780
That's why they scream.

1132
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,400
They are like, it's time.

1133
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,880
What is that?

1134
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:59,300
What?

1135
00:52:59,380 --> 00:52:59,880
Hey, guys.

1136
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,460
Hey, guys.

1137
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,420
Hey.

1138
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:06,300
Hey.

1139
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:13,170
The master?

1140
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:14,230
Who's the master?

1141
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:15,770
Hey, guys.

1142
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:17,850
Man, that's so weird.

1143
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:19,430
The cicada won't fucking leave.

1144
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:21,670
Hey.

1145
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:22,730
Hey, guys.

1146
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:24,430
What are you talking about?

1147
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:29,450
What the fuck do I want gold, man?

1148
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:30,890
You turned me into a cicada.

1149
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:33,690
I don't know where to go.

1150
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:41,130
Oh my god, why do they hate monkey?

1151
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:43,790
You have a time limit?

1152
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:44,090
Where?

1153
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,630
There's no time limit anywhere.

1154
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:47,250
Whoa!

1155
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:50,250
That's a big boy.

1156
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:51,370
Oh, wait.

1157
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,270
Is that my stamina?

1158
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,570
Oh, it's my stamina, guys.

1159
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,910
Hey, cicada noises.

1160
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:58,870
Wait, I want to look at this big boy.

1161
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:01,090
Look at him.

1162
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:01,970
He's so big.

1163
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,310
Oh, shit!

1164
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:07,650
Guys, I fucked up.

1165
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:09,130
Guys, I fucked up.

1166
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:10,850
Oh, shit.

1167
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:12,470
Oh, shit.

1168
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:17,150
I just wanted to look at the big boy.

1169
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,690
Oh, god.

1170
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,410
Okay, he's not following me.

1171
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,290
That's good.

1172
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:28,410
I just wanted to look at him.

1173
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,550
I just wanted to see what he's doing.

1174
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:35,110
I just wanted to see what he's doing.

1175
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:37,150
Perform the block incoming.

1176
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:38,630
Oh, okay, now.

1177
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:40,770
Oh, I already had it.

1178
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,390
Okay, guys.

1179
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:42,850
Alright.

1180
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:44,650
Okay, guys.

1181
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:44,650
Alright.

1182
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:45,510
Okay,

1183
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:57,860
guys.

1184
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:57,860
Alright.

1185
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,840
I just wanted...

1186
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,460
I wanted this.

1187
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,040
How did it...

1188
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,080
Okay, I was on fire.

1189
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:07,820
It's okay.

1190
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,780
I wanted the cicada powers.

1191
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,020
Is he gonna give me cicada powers again?

1192
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,420
Oh, no.

1193
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,920
Oh, okay.

1194
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:15,940
Alright.

1195
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,040
Made a fucked up.

1196
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:19,480
Guys.

1197
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,280
Oh, shit.

1198
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,000
Don't worry.

1199
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,420
No moving for you.

1200
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,420
Okay, we're okay.

1201
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,180
We're slowly learning, guys.

1202
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,360
Alright.

1203
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,300
Guys, look!

1204
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:32,980
I dodged!

1205
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,200
I did it!

1206
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:34,880
I can learn!

1207
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,020
Alright.

1208
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:38,320
I...

1209
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:39,900
Oh, man.

1210
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,060
He gave me the cicada...

1211
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:43,160
I didn't realize it was one time use only.

1212
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,300
I thought he would come back to give me cicada powers.

1213
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:48,500
I didn't...

1214
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,320
How was I supposed to know it was one use only?

1215
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,880
I was being...

1216
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,380
I was being cocky!

1217
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,900
I was fucking around!

1218
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,320
Oh, man!

1219
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,500
I was fucking around!

1220
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,360
I'm sorry!

1221
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,340
I didn't learn my lesson!

1222
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,460
No cicada for you.

1223
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,420
Who are you?

1224
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,480
Oh, ogre!

1225
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:14,900
Oh!

1226
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,120
Did you see that dodge?

1227
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,000
Oh, shit!

1228
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,420
Okay, but not that one, though.

1229
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:19,920
Oh, shit.

1230
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,160
Okay.

1231
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:21,600
Okay.

1232
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:23,620
Alright.

1233
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:24,680
Immobile!

1234
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,020
Here we go.

1235
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,080
You literally said time limit, but I never listen!

1236
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,560
That's the thing!

1237
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:34,760
Who is this guy?

1238
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,680
Oh, bandit chief?

1239
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,780
And by God's sake, I lived a youth in town.

1240
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:40,720
Alright.

1241
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:42,920
Nice!

1242
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:43,980
I leveled up!

1243
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,020
He was guarding this!

1244
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,620
What did I get?

1245
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,400
I got evil repellent and tiny piece of gold.

1246
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:52,880
Okay.

1247
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,320
Somewhere I learned this time.

1248
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,580
That's fucking right.

1249
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,540
That's fucking right.

1250
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,200
I'm coming in.

1251
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,440
You thought you could use arrows?

1252
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,200
This is the very first time I've seen you, man.

1253
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,820
Never seen you before in my life.

1254
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,020
Very first fight, guys.

1255
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,460
Very first fight.

1256
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,260
What the fuck?

1257
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,280
Oh, shit.

1258
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,040
I'm so sorry.

1259
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:19,780
I'm so sorry, man.

1260
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,480
I didn't realize...

1261
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,720
I didn't realize I...

1262
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,040
Oh, I didn't realize I pulled your hair!

1263
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,720
I pulled a nerve ending!

1264
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:27,860
Whoa!

1265
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,560
Okay.

1266
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,500
Holy shit, he's so tanky!

1267
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,060
You're a plant!

1268
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,740
How are you so tanky?

1269
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:37,820
Boom.

1270
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:38,760
Oh.

1271
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:40,840
Alright.

1272
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,920
Haha, look at this loser.

1273
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,000
He tripped and fell.

1274
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,260
Easy.

1275
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,640
Oh, I got ginseng!

1276
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,360
Where are you?

1277
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,320
Yeah, there's a flower.

1278
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:51,980
Mimic.

1279
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:54,520
Gifts rocking forth from the earth.

1280
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:55,460
Spirits untied.

1281
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,540
Roots serve as limbs.

1282
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,380
Oh, it's like a...

1283
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,520
It's actually like a...

1284
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,060
Mimic.

1285
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,180
Oh, for plants.

1286
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,420
I'm so lost.

1287
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,880
Sir, do you know where to go?

1288
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,640
I'm so lost.

1289
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:20,560
I don't...

1290
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,500
I don't know where to go, sir.

1291
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,080
Alright, loot.

1292
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:28,880
Why...

1293
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,440
Why did I not scout ahead like he told me to?

1294
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:33,240
Oh, no.

1295
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:33,820
It's the crow.

1296
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:34,900
It's the crow.

1297
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,620
He's so scary.

1298
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:37,760
Oh, no.

1299
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:38,340
It's the crow.

1300
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:39,760
Mobile.

1301
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:40,160
Immobile!

1302
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,560
That's fucking right.

1303
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,240
He has so much range.

1304
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,240
Oh, alright.

1305
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:48,560
Don't worry.

1306
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:49,160
I got this.

1307
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,480
Oh, shit!

1308
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:51,880
Oh!

1309
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,180
Dodged.

1310
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,940
Oh, shit!

1311
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:55,680
Oh!

1312
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,400
Six or so.

1313
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,820
He's like half my...

1314
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:00,780
He's like double my size!

1315
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,080
I'm getting better at the combat, though.

1316
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,240
Oh, nice.

1317
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:07,640
Nice.

1318
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:07,980
Alright.

1319
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,180
We got another spark.

1320
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,000
Oh, he was just trying to meditate in the water.

1321
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:15,800
You know like in...

1322
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,560
In like Chinese films?

1323
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,640
In shows?

1324
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:23,300
They like meditate in the water to increase their toughness or whatever?

1325
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,140
That's what he was doing.

1326
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,100
Didn't help him.

1327
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,380
I can't even read and I beat your ass.

1328
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:31,660
I can't even read and I beat your ass.

1329
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:32,560
Let's see.

1330
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,620
Where the fuck am I?

1331
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,320
Where...

1332
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:42,800
This entire game is just like, where am I?

1333
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,440
Oh, I can level up now.

1334
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,020
Oh...

1335
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,680
More agile and flexible.

1336
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,540
Monitoring costs stamina.

1337
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,860
While using...

1338
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,980
Okay, we don't...

1339
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:56,980
Oh!

1340
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,460
Oh!

1341
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,660
Okay, maybe we should...

1342
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:03,340
We should have this so we can actually like move forward.

1343
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,640
Level significantly increases...

1344
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,080
Alright, that's...

1345
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,420
We should grab...

1346
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:09,740
Stances.

1347
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,520
Uses a health recover upon...

1348
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,180
Enable sprinting while charging.

1349
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,380
Do I have this yet?

1350
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:15,680
No.

1351
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,460
Switching to allows...

1352
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,240
the destined one to support himself...

1353
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:19,980
and ascend.

1354
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,520
The more focus he builds, the higher he perches.

1355
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:26,780
I don't know.

1356
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,820
There's so many talents.

1357
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:31,320
There's no meta.

1358
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,240
This game literally just came out.

1359
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:33,980
There's no meta.

1360
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:40,640
So many choices.

1361
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,200
I'm so bad at making decisions.

1362
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,780
Water increases damage.

1363
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:47,240
The...

1364
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,000
That's good!

1365
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,120
That increases more damage.

1366
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,780
I don't know how to metacraft!

1367
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:56,500
Alright.

1368
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,420
What are you gonna do?

1369
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,480
Fucking watch your friend die?

1370
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:00,920
He's like...

1371
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,020
Wait, I don't know that guy.

1372
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,240
Alright.

1373
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,220
Think like a...

1374
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:09,940
What would Monkey do?

1375
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,120
Am I supposed to fight the big guy?

1376
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:13,580
Oh.

1377
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:16,920
How dare you interrupt my meditation?

1378
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:17,700
Hello?

1379
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,260
Oh, that's another big guy.

1380
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,000
Wait, there's two big guys?

1381
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,260
Oh no.

1382
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:24,400
You know what?

1383
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:27,480
I'll do this big guy first and then we'll do the other big guy.

1384
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:28,720
Hello, sir!

1385
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,140
I'm just a little monkey.

1386
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:32,740
I'm just a little monkey.

1387
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I'm not here to do anything bad.

1388
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,180
I'm not here to do anything bad.

1389
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:38,220
Another monkey I see.

1390
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:38,880
That's me.

1391
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,440
Oh no, he's wolf.

1392
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:41,980
Kwanzee.

1393
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:44,260
Oh!

1394
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:46,180
Yes!

1395
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,680
We're gonna meditate, right?

1396
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,380
This doesn't look like meditating, sir.

1397
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:51,900
Oh no.

1398
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,640
Oh shit, no!

1399
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:55,660
Okay.

1400
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,100
What the fuck?

1401
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,000
You.

1402
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:00,580
Okay.

1403
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,000
Fine.

1404
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:04,740
We're fine.

1405
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,480
What?

1406
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:09,880
Oh no.

1407
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,200
This is not fine.

1408
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:12,960
We're not fine.

1409
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:14,580
We're not.

1410
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,780
We're not fine!

1411
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,720
Okay, that's how the dodges work.

1412
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:18,080
No!

1413
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:18,600
What?

1414
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:20,700
We're not fine.

1415
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,380
Can I leave?

1416
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:22,180
Whoa!

1417
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:23,780
Whoa!

1418
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:30,130
Oh shit.

1419
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:32,450
What are these attacks?

1420
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:35,370
What are these attacks?

1421
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:36,890
I'm fucking leaving.

1422
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:37,190
No!

1423
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:41,850
Oh my god.

1424
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:43,530
He has so many fucking...

1425
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:44,470
Oh god.

1426
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:45,870
He has so many attacks.

1427
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:47,270
Wait, can I cheese this here?

1428
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:48,650
What if I...

1429
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:50,370
There's no way he can get me here.

1430
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:51,770
Oh no.

1431
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:52,610
Oh no.

1432
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:54,570
I have insignificant mana?

1433
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:57,090
What do you mean I can't cheese?

1434
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:58,670
Okay, but what if I cheese it here?

1435
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,940
How many attacks does he have?

1436
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:09,420
He has so...

1437
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:10,960
That's bullshit!

1438
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,060
That guy has like...

1439
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:15,860
7 plus different attack combos!

1440
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,160
I...

1441
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:23,600
He can also jump?

1442
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,260
Like...

1443
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,680
Like it's so fair!

1444
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,960
He has so many!

1445
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,560
He has so...

1446
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,160
He has so many different attacks!

1447
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:37,440
There's no cheese for you.

1448
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,220
He has like 5 MILLION DIFFERENT ATTACKS!

1449
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:47,800
Just use the same talent Bill from Journey to the West wrote the meta hundreds of years ago.

1450
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,260
Thank you Marino.

1451
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,400
Thank you for the super chat.

1452
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:51,960
Thank you.

1453
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,140
Oh my god.

1454
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,960
Please don't tell me there's another phase too.

1455
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,020
Like how he was still watching his friend.

1456
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,460
He's just like, please man, I was just watching.

1457
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,580
He melted the cheese.

1458
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,460
Oh my god.

1459
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:09,240
Thank you.

1460
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,280
Okay, we can do this.

1461
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,500
Hello sir, I'm back.

1462
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:17,220
I need to download your controls again.

1463
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:21,240
Alright, nice.

1464
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:22,800
Oh shit!

1465
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:23,600
No, nice!

1466
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:28,920
I think his thing is too like there was no difficulty setting.

1467
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:29,900
You go straight in.

1468
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,320
It is literally Dark Souls.

1469
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,740
I feel like this is...

1470
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:36,660
Except the fact that dying has no consequences.

1471
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:39,240
Ah!

1472
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:43,440
Again!

1473
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:45,440
Please!

1474
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:47,820
Oh my god!

1475
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:52,400
Oh god, okay.

1476
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,800
Oh, no!

1477
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:55,920
No!

1478
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,580
You're still going!

1479
01:04:59,040 --> 01:04:59,780
Bitch!

1480
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,460
You have so many attacks!

1481
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,480
Oh god.

1482
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,240
No!

1483
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:10,500
Alright.

1484
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:17,520
Dodge!

1485
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:17,920
Dodge!

1486
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:18,860
Dodge!

1487
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:20,060
Okay.

1488
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:22,520
Dodge!

1489
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,320
Jesus Christ!

1490
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:24,840
Oh!

1491
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:25,480
No!

1492
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,200
No!

1493
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:27,900
Roll!

1494
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:28,980
Stop dropping!

1495
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:29,220
Roll!

1496
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:30,420
Stop dropping!

1497
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:30,700
Roll!

1498
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:32,800
Stop dropping!

1499
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:33,140
Roll!

1500
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,680
Stop dropping!

1501
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,020
Roll!

1502
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:37,520
Oh!

1503
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,260
Please sir!

1504
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:40,900
Oh shit!

1505
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,840
I already got half way!

1506
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,880
Oh!

1507
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:45,640
Oh my god!

1508
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,560
What would my ancestors do?

1509
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:54,020
Stop!

1510
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:55,980
Drop!

1511
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,240
Stop!

1512
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,060
Drop!

1513
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,580
Oh my god!

1514
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:03,760
He's so fast!

1515
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:11,240
Why did I not pack more cords?

1516
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:12,260
I...

1517
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,360
Oh!

1518
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:18,080
Please don't tell me there's space too!

1519
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:19,500
Okay.

1520
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,440
I can figure this out.

1521
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:23,440
This guy!

1522
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,040
Okay!

1523
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:29,020
Unlike Souls games, like, they don't have fucking one million movesets!

1524
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,620
I swear to god!

1525
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,220
He has like two million movesets!

1526
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:37,020
I swear to fucking god!

1527
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:38,880
I feel like I'm...

1528
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,680
Every time I fight him, I see a new move!

1529
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,140
He didn't even jump that time!

1530
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:45,700
He has

1531
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,180
two hundred million moves!

1532
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:53,420
I...

1533
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,200
Okay.

1534
01:06:59,200 --> 01:06:59,880
Oh...

1535
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,620
It is an Elden Ring?

1536
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,380
Oh my god.

1537
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:02,960
Okay.

1538
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:06,640
I still need to figure out the timing for the dodges!

1539
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,100
I'm so fucking stupid!

1540
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:10,840
Alright.

1541
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:11,600
Don't worry.

1542
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:12,420
I figured it out.

1543
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:14,680
Okay.

1544
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,880
This is... This time it'll be different.

1545
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:18,060
I figured it out.

1546
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,480
I figured it out.

1547
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:20,420
I got this.

1548
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,660
Get over here.

1549
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,100
Wait, wait.

1550
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:24,340
Not...

1551
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:24,920
Wait, wait.

1552
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:25,980
Oh god.

1553
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:26,640
Okay.

1554
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:27,500
Alright.

1555
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:28,640
I was like, wait a minute.

1556
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,640
I didn't mean that.

1557
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:31,820
Wow!

1558
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:33,300
What did you fucking...

1559
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:33,900
Okay.

1560
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,320
Alright.

1561
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,520
Alright.

1562
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,320
Okay.

1563
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:40,260
That's one of them.

1564
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:41,320
Alright.

1565
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:42,100
No!

1566
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:42,860
Oh!

1567
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:44,180
Oh!

1568
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:45,420
Stop!

1569
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:46,680
Stop!

1570
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:50,730
Alright.

1571
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:51,650
Ah!

1572
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:52,350
Fuck!

1573
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:54,850
Please!

1574
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:56,150
Sir!

1575
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:59,430
I'm just trying to find some bananas!

1576
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:03,550
Oh!

1577
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:05,050
Okay.

1578
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:06,750
How does that hit me?

1579
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:09,250
Okay.

1580
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:10,970
Alright.

1581
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:11,990
Nice.

1582
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:12,310
Alright.

1583
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:14,250
I just want...

1584
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,310
Oh!

1585
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:16,090
Alright.

1586
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:18,990
I just... I got lost!

1587
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:20,870
I was just trying to find bananas!

1588
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:22,530
Alright.

1589
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:24,670
I just got lost!

1590
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:25,210
Sir!

1591
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:27,370
Oh!

1592
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:28,370
Come on!

1593
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:29,390
Sir!

1594
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:30,230
Please!

1595
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:31,770
Please!

1596
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:35,170
Oh!

1597
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:35,410
Oh!

1598
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:37,710
Keep rolling!

1599
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:41,430
Now... How do I stop rolling?

1600
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:46,210
Oh, okay.

1601
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:46,750
Get stun!

1602
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:47,630
Get stun!

1603
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:52,850
Oh, no!

1604
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:53,550
I'm down in stamina!

1605
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:54,670
This is bad!

1606
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:55,630
This is bad!

1607
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:56,210
No!

1608
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:56,790
Nooo!

1609
01:08:58,810 --> 01:08:59,410
Okay.

1610
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:02,730
Oh, leave me alone, please!

1611
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:03,570
Leave me alone!

1612
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:04,590
Please!

1613
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:06,210
Okay.

1614
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:08,290
No!

1615
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:09,510
Oh, god!

1616
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:10,890
Nooo!

1617
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:11,690
Please!

1618
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:17,070
Wait, can I stop rolling?!

1619
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:18,710
Oh, please!

1620
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:21,570
Oh, that is my way!

1621
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:24,150
Oh, thank god!

1622
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:29,570
Oh, god!

1623
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,950
I can finally get banana!

1624
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:34,790
Me?!

1625
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:38,010
Me?!

1626
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:39,330
I'm just here for some bananas!

1627
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:40,570
Alright.

1628
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:41,410
Oh, my god!

1629
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:42,410
This is a longer pull!

1630
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:45,010
Surely, it'll be easier now!

1631
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:51,370
That's the very very very intense vibe of each thrust.

1632
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:53,830
The flames do rise.

1633
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:56,530
Transform into a wolf guai and inflict scorch.

1634
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:58,010
Oh, I can be a wolf?!

1635
01:09:58,010 --> 01:09:59,660
I can have the wolf inside me?!

1636
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:02,110
Alright.

1637
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:09,070
Weapons and valuable chairs by Yao Guai often carry lingering obsessions from the deceased's owners.

1638
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:12,370
Collect them, granting them the ability to swiftly take their form in combat.

1639
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:16,650
Each transformation has its own strength, making them worth experimenting with.

1640
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:18,430
Oh, you can like change your style!

1641
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:23,770
Using spells during further depletes might, and once it's fully...

1642
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:25,610
Oh, so it's like...

1643
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:26,550
It's like a special power!

1644
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:28,730
I got the dog in me.

1645
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:29,810
Alright.

1646
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:32,370
Do I have to change my weapon?

1647
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:33,510
Or is it this?

1648
01:10:35,010 --> 01:10:36,310
Wait, how do I...

1649
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:39,310
How do I...

1650
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:40,930
activate it, though?

1651
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:45,530
Increases damage...

1652
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:46,210
Oh, I should've...

1653
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:47,350
Oh, thank god I didn't use that.

1654
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:48,310
Thank god.

1655
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:49,550
Uh...

1656
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:50,770
It's a transform...

1657
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:51,870
Oh, it's the magic then!

1658
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:53,930
Holy shit.

1659
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:54,690
Hahaha!

1660
01:10:56,430 --> 01:10:57,490
Oh my god.

1661
01:10:57,550 --> 01:10:58,910
I can't believe I got...

1662
01:10:58,910 --> 01:10:59,030
I...

1663
01:10:59,610 --> 01:11:00,350
Oh my god.

1664
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:04,130
It says action RPG, but in the end it was actually...

1665
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:05,270
Action Souls!

1666
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:08,670
We better dodge.

1667
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:11,990
Please, somebody...

1668
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:12,750
Heal me.

1669
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:15,750
Okay, no, I ran out of drinks.

1670
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:17,030
Okay, where's my...

1671
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:18,670
Okay, this is...

1672
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:20,370
Oh!

1673
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:21,670
I'm Wolf now!

1674
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:24,350
Okay, light, heavy...

1675
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:25,550
I see.

1676
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:27,170
Where's my magic?

1677
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:27,970
Though.

1678
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:32,590
Only say series...

1679
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:34,210
Alright.

1680
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:37,190
Souls is action RPG.

1681
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:38,290
RPG.

1682
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:39,890
Hahaha!

1683
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:45,870
Did you watch the Hong Kong TV series Journey to the West when you were...

1684
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:46,210
Yes!

1685
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:46,770
I did!

1686
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:48,810
I was thinking of the Super Chat thinking that...

1687
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:50,250
Yeah, we were talking about that earlier.

1688
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:51,110
In the beginning.

1689
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,060
Ring.

1690
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:56,260
Ring.

1691
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,620
I killed your dad.

1692
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,060
Ring.

1693
01:11:59,100 --> 01:11:59,360
Ring.

1694
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,180
That's right.

1695
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:01,820
That was me.

1696
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:02,740
I did that.

1697
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:09,560
Everyone must know!

1698
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:10,300
Hahaha!

1699
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:11,560
First try!

1700
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,660
Let them all know!

1701
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,700
I first tried him!

1702
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:25,780
Real!

1703
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:27,780
Hahaha!

1704
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:31,280
Now all of the West know!

1705
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,220
Hahaha!

1706
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:39,300
They gotta know that I totally definitely first tried him!

1707
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,040
Let's see.

1708
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,160
Oh, God, I need heals so badly.

1709
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:51,420
I'm gonna like walk up to the first guy I see and get slapped and then die.

1710
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:53,200
There's no way.

1711
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:55,380
Alright.

1712
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,460
What's this here?

1713
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:57,200
Oh!

1714
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:57,600
Oh!

1715
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:57,920
Okay.

1716
01:12:57,980 --> 01:12:58,880
That is just loot.

1717
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:00,600
Is that it?

1718
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:02,920
I cannot jump.

1719
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:03,960
I can only roll.

1720
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:07,220
I don't have the power of jump yet.

1721
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,200
Holy shit.

1722
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,100
We're so...

1723
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:12,720
Is there anything up here?

1724
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,160
Why is there a platform here?

1725
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:15,640
Okay.

1726
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,140
Surely nothing bad is gonna happen, right?

1727
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:20,200
Right?

1728
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:20,880
Hahaha!

1729
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:21,960
Yeah!

1730
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:24,820
Hahaha!

1731
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:26,100
Yeah!

1732
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:27,580
Hahaha!

1733
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:28,420
Whoa!

1734
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:29,400
Oh, God!

1735
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,320
Oh, that was close!

1736
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:31,580
Yeah, I'm going back to the shrine.

1737
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,280
I need to heal so badly.

1738
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:34,580
Alright.

1739
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:35,720
I need to figure out where...

1740
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,080
GPS!

1741
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:38,120
Okay.

1742
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:39,560
Oh, yeah.

1743
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:41,060
I forgot about the other big boy.

1744
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:41,500
It's okay.

1745
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:42,840
The other big boy wasn't important.

1746
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:44,380
He didn't get a special cutscene.

1747
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,800
Like that big boy.

1748
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:47,540
Oh, God.

1749
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,460
How do I get back?

1750
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:49,280
Okay.

1751
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:49,880
Okay.

1752
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:50,540
Up here.

1753
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:52,180
And then...

1754
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:53,600
Up here.

1755
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:55,500
Yeah.

1756
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,320
And then...

1757
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,280
Down here.

1758
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,200
Please don't...

1759
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,020
Oh, there's no fall damage.

1760
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:00,380
Okay.

1761
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:01,340
And...

1762
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:02,440
Uh...

1763
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,880
Everything looks the same.

1764
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:04,640
It's just green.

1765
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:07,540
Down here.

1766
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:09,080
And then...

1767
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:09,420
Oh, it's here!

1768
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,300
I remember the bridge!

1769
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:13,300
Okay.

1770
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,240
And then the shrine should be like...

1771
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:17,400
Back here?

1772
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:19,340
Yeah!

1773
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,480
I did it.

1774
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,460
I figured it out.

1775
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:22,960
Oh, thank God.

1776
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:23,280
Okay.

1777
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,500
We gotta rest up.

1778
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:26,000
Figured it out.

1779
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:26,700
Hahaha!

1780
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,060
Hahaha!

1781
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:28,720
Okay.

1782
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,060
Okay.

1783
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:31,540
We're fine.

1784
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,240
I guess now it's the big boy time, right?

1785
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,580
That's fucking right.

1786
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:40,920
Wait.

1787
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:43,640
If I transform into a wolf, do they see me as them?

1788
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:44,920
All right.

1789
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:45,260
Let's try.

1790
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:47,760
Okay.

1791
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,120
Hello!

1792
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,720
I'm just like you!

1793
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:53,440
Are we friends?

1794
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:54,540
We're not friends.

1795
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:55,440
Hahaha!

1796
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:56,780
Okay.

1797
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:57,300
Okay.

1798
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,900
We could've been friends!

1799
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:01,400
But I saw you raise your fucking stick!

1800
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:03,280
You think I didn't, no?

1801
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:05,040
Okay.

1802
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,000
He raised his axe.

1803
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:08,900
So, we are not friends.

1804
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:10,220
All right.

1805
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:12,220
Okay.

1806
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,260
Oh, why did I use that?

1807
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:14,840
I should...

1808
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:15,260
Okay, guys.

1809
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:15,980
We gotta wait now.

1810
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:16,620
We...

1811
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:17,300
Hahaha!

1812
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,780
I didn't realize he was right there!

1813
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:22,620
Hahaha!

1814
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:25,040
I didn't realize!

1815
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,280
Now I have to wait for my chance!

1816
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,020
Transformation!

1817
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,460
I didn't realize he was right here!

1818
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:31,320
All right.

1819
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:31,980
While we're doing...

1820
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:32,200
Waiting.

1821
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:33,880
Let's figure out upgrades.

1822
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:35,260
Oh, this is...

1823
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,060
Let's be transforming.

1824
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:36,520
Right?

1825
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:37,380
Transforming, right?

1826
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,860
Modern increases damage of the next...

1827
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:40,680
Cannot awaken.

1828
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,680
So, like, after getting there, I can awaken this.

1829
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:45,080
Um...

1830
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:45,960
Okay.

1831
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,400
I can upgrade this even more.

1832
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:48,800
Stances.

1833
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:50,580
Um...

1834
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:54,190
Okay.

1835
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,190
Maybe we got...

1836
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:56,430
That's lifesteal, right?

1837
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:57,890
This has to be lifesteal.

1838
01:15:58,110 --> 01:15:58,630
Okay.

1839
01:15:58,650 --> 01:15:59,610
All right.

1840
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:02,090
This is fine.

1841
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:03,910
Okay.

1842
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:04,870
We're almost there.

1843
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:06,230
Give me a sec, bro.

1844
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:07,450
I need a...

1845
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:08,770
Give me a sec, man.

1846
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:09,550
I need a...

1847
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:10,730
I need to wait for the cooldown.

1848
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,330
I wasted wolf form on another wolf.

1849
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:15,230
It was wolf on wolf violence.

1850
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:16,230
I couldn't help it.

1851
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,100
I couldn't help it, man.

1852
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,380
I thought we could be friends.

1853
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:29,000
I thought now that I was a wolf, he wouldn't be, like, specious towards me.

1854
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:31,100
Because he's like, oh, yeah, I just hate monkeys.

1855
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:31,340
You know?

1856
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:32,340
But no.

1857
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:33,940
He hates even wolves.

1858
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:39,740
He also hated wolves, too.

1859
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:41,700
He just hated everybody.

1860
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:44,780
Okay.

1861
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,040
Oh, my God.

1862
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:46,300
Please.

1863
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:47,480
This cooldown is so long.

1864
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:47,780
Okay.

1865
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:50,840
By the time I get to him, I would have finished the cooldown.

1866
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:52,560
Guys, don't worry.

1867
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:54,880
That's why he doesn't expect a thing.

1868
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,140
That's fucking right.

1869
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,880
He'd never expect anything.

1870
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:01,040
Boom.

1871
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,080
Oh, yeah.

1872
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:03,540
He's crying.

1873
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,420
Little bitch.

1874
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:05,460
Oh, shit.

1875
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:05,740
I'm stuck.

1876
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,000
Oh, God.

1877
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:07,860
I didn't mean that.

1878
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:08,260
Oh.

1879
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,540
I didn't mean that.

1880
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,140
Oh, God.

1881
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:13,560
What the fuck?

1882
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:14,120
Wait.

1883
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:14,600
What?

1884
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:16,660
He can do that?

1885
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:17,920
Oh, God.

1886
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:20,140
I need to redo my stamina.

1887
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:21,380
Okay.

1888
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:22,160
Oh.

1889
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:23,820
I didn't know he could do that.

1890
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:24,680
Don't worry.

1891
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:25,360
What?

1892
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:26,800
Okay.

1893
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:29,420
That's it.

1894
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,380
Don't worry.

1895
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:32,460
I've got the wolf in me now.

1896
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:33,060
Okay.

1897
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,340
That's fucking right.

1898
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,720
Not what you're gonna do.

1899
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,660
I've got the wolf in me.

1900
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:39,180
That's fucking right.

1901
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:41,520
That's right.

1902
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:41,680
No.

1903
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:43,120
I'm hurt.

1904
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:44,660
Oh, shit.

1905
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:45,380
Oh.

1906
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:46,640
It's okay.

1907
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,900
I know that's... that will hurt me.

1908
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:51,360
Okay.

1909
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,020
I don't like how... you know.

1910
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:59,700
I'm barely doing any damage right now.

1911
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:00,460
That's the...

1912
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:01,180
Oh, nice.

1913
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:02,600
That's fucking right.

1914
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,420
That's fucking right, baby.

1915
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:06,880
Nice.

1916
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:07,960
Nice dodge.

1917
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,760
Oh, what?

1918
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:12,300
That should be legal.

1919
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,020
That was so much damage.

1920
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,440
It's actually not fair.

1921
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,440
Why?

1922
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:19,540
He's so...

1923
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:21,180
It's like he's so big.

1924
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:31,740
It's like the bigger he is, the more strength he has.

1925
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:32,580
What?

1926
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:37,120
Oh my god!

1927
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:38,980
That should be illegal!

1928
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:44,800
Have you tried it, Doki?

1929
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:47,780
There's this new meta that they developed.

1930
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:48,660
It's called dodging.

1931
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:55,560
Oh my god, now I wasted... now I'm like 1 HP short from it.

1932
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:56,080
No!

1933
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:01,200
I'm letting the Woldrig... he got in my head!

1934
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:06,120
The big baby got in my head!

1935
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:08,860
Now I'm getting hit!

1936
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:12,540
Okay, nice.

1937
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:14,960
Get open!

1938
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,420
He's in my head!

1939
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:17,940
Alright.

1940
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:19,640
Big baby.

1941
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:21,700
I'll beat you up, big baby.

1942
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:23,580
That's fucking right.

1943
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,020
Oh my god, he's so strong!

1944
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:30,740
No!

1945
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:31,780
God damn it!

1946
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:32,940
Whoa!

1947
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:33,760
Big baby!

1948
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,480
What the fuck?!

1949
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:42,660
Where do I... where do I fucking go at that point?!

1950
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:45,320
Jesus Christ!

1951
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,980
Holy shit!

1952
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:48,600
No!

1953
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,500
Wolfguy is not doing so well, guys.

1954
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:57,240
It's okay, I might be dead here.

1955
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:01,580
Holy shit.

1956
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,700
Okay, there's no way he can break that rock.

1957
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:05,220
Rock, right?

1958
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,260
Tree doesn't block him?

1959
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,340
Okay, but like...

1960
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:15,360
Why can't we be friends?

1961
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,280
Why can't we be friends?

1962
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:17,700
Oh!

1963
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:18,300
Whoa!

1964
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,120
Whoa!

1965
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:23,020
Why can't we... does he respawn if I kill him?

1966
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:24,340
No!

1967
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:25,640
No, no, no, no, no!

1968
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:26,460
No!

1969
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,160
What?!

1970
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,960
You win this fight, I'm running!

1971
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:32,100
Hahaha!

1972
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,320
You win this fight, big baby!

1973
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,040
I leave!

1974
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:40,820
Oh, hey, I'm gonna gather here.

1975
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,080
Is he gonna kill me from all the way there?

1976
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,100
That's fucking right.

1977
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:45,040
I know your range.

1978
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:48,040
I know... I know your range.

1979
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,000
It's okay, oh, it's okay.

1980
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:50,660
Rematch.

1981
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:52,780
We just gotta get our HP.

1982
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:53,820
No!

1983
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,120
We will kill him!

1984
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:56,900
We will kill him!

1985
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,840
I don't even know if he respawns back.

1986
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:03,420
No, he can't...

1987
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:04,660
There's no way.

1988
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,980
There's no way I can kill him.

1989
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:10,400
I'm not a coward!

1990
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,240
I'm just...

1991
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:12,800
It's called Tactical Ret...

1992
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:13,380
Oh, shit!

1993
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,540
It is a Tactical Retreat!

1994
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:18,880
Alright.

1995
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:26,310
I'll be so sad if he respawns after everything I did.

1996
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,970
Alright, don't worry, I figured it out.

1997
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:31,670
I figured it out.

1998
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:33,370
I know his... his pattern now.

1999
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:33,870
That's right.

2000
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:35,510
I figured you out, big baby.

2001
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:37,170
I've downloaded you.

2002
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:40,050
Now that I know you can jump, it's over.

2003
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:41,230
That's right.

2004
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:43,230
Turn around, big baby.

2005
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:44,890
Turn the fuck around.

2006
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:46,370
That's right.

2007
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:47,550
You let your guard down.

2008
01:21:47,630 --> 01:21:48,530
Mistake number one!

2009
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:50,670
Mistake number one!

2010
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:53,290
You should never let your guard down, bitch!

2011
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:55,650
Oh, you're gonna cry?

2012
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:56,890
That's right.

2013
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:57,770
Wolf is here now.

2014
01:21:57,990 --> 01:21:58,350
Wolf.

2015
01:21:59,050 --> 01:21:59,530
Okay.

2016
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:03,030
Oh, shit!

2017
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:03,430
Oh, nice.

2018
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:04,030
I dodged it.

2019
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:05,370
Oh, fuck!

2020
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:06,450
I forgot about that, too!

2021
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:07,410
It's fine.

2022
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:08,570
It's fine.

2023
01:22:08,650 --> 01:22:09,230
I realize...

2024
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:09,550
Yes!

2025
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:10,170
Ow.

2026
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:11,470
I did not dodge that.

2027
01:22:11,950 --> 01:22:12,830
Oh, fuck!

2028
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:15,130
Okay.

2029
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:16,090
It's fine.

2030
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:16,450
We're fine.

2031
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:18,910
We are so not fine.

2032
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:19,750
Oh, nice!

2033
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:19,930
Nice!

2034
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:20,430
He fell down!

2035
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:21,170
Good nerd.

2036
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:22,650
Okay.

2037
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:26,510
Whoa!

2038
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:28,810
There's no way you can clap again.

2039
01:22:29,270 --> 01:22:30,630
Oh, shit!

2040
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:31,650
Oh, shit!

2041
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:32,490
He jumped!

2042
01:22:32,950 --> 01:22:33,630
Oh!

2043
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:35,070
He headbashes!

2044
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:38,290
How d'you still have new moves?!

2045
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:40,890
How d'you...

2046
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:44,410
How d'you still have new fucking moves?!

2047
01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:45,170
I...

2048
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:46,770
I...

2049
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:47,450
I...

2050
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:47,610
I...

2051
01:22:47,610 --> 01:22:47,770
I...

2052
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:47,950
I...

2053
01:22:47,950 --> 01:22:48,930
I...

2054
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:49,590
Stop!

2055
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:55,150
Jesus Christ.

2056
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:57,690
God, please.

2057
01:22:58,050 --> 01:22:59,530
If there is a god.

2058
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:01,210
You wouldn't let me live.

2059
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:01,630
You wouldn't let me live.

2060
01:23:01,630 --> 01:23:04,410
Okay, he got it!

2061
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:05,170
He got it!

2062
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:07,490
Why does this reach?

2063
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:09,250
What the f**k?

2064
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:16,590
He f**king ate this big baby!

2065
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:19,010
F**king cry, you nerd!

2066
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:22,010
I'm tempted to be dead!

2067
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:30,630
Why is this so much harder against the wolf?

2068
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:33,070
It's not fair!

2069
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:37,870
How does he still have new moves?

2070
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:39,890
How does he still...

2071
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:43,630
Okay, this time I've downloaded him.

2072
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:45,090
I figured it out.

2073
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:46,030
Guys.

2074
01:23:47,330 --> 01:23:49,230
Guys, I figured it out this time.

2075
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:50,730
It's over.

2076
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:53,870
I figured out his movesets.

2077
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:57,690
You can't do anything anymore.

2078
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:00,470
I figured it out, chat.

2079
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:02,170
For real.

2080
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:06,170
I've downloaded him.

2081
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:10,630
I don't even know if I have time to do charge attacks sometimes.

2082
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:14,870
I do a lot of light attacks because I always feel like I don't have time.

2083
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:16,070
Alright.

2084
01:24:16,910 --> 01:24:18,070
Oh sh**, baby.

2085
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:22,210
Don't worry, he's gonna turn around and I'm gonna have one free hit.

2086
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:23,230
Watch this.

2087
01:24:24,610 --> 01:24:25,090
Boom!

2088
01:24:26,950 --> 01:24:27,910
New hit!

2089
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:29,650
That's f**king right.

2090
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:32,930
That's f**king right.

2091
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:35,770
Yeah, cry big baby!

2092
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:37,830
Boom!

2093
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:40,390
I learned.

2094
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:41,930
I learned.

2095
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:45,290
Can't do anything now, big baby!

2096
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:47,630
Oh, you're gonna fall?

2097
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:49,950
Yeah, cry to your god!

2098
01:24:50,830 --> 01:24:51,930
Which is me!

2099
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:53,530
No!

2100
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:53,910
No!

2101
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:53,930
No!

2102
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:55,250
No!

2103
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:58,410
I dodged it!

2104
01:24:58,790 --> 01:24:59,690
Okay.

2105
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:00,950
Alright.

2106
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:06,140
Run, run, run!

2107
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:10,520
He's still going!

2108
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,240
He's still going!

2109
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:14,580
He's still going!

2110
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,600
What is that?

2111
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:19,240
What is that combo?

2112
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,440
He's still f**king going!

2113
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,020
He's still f**king going!

2114
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:26,400
STOP!

2115
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:27,480
STOP!

2116
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:32,720
STOP YOUR FUCKING COMBO, YOU NERD!

2117
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:38,280
YOUR MOTHER DOESN'T LOVE YOU, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ABANDONED AS A CHILD!

2118
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,780
I CAN CRY!

2119
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:47,720
THAT'S RIGHT, YOUR MOTHER HATES YOU!

2120
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,000
Oh god, I have to dodge.

2121
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:50,980
Alright.

2122
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,400
It's okay.

2123
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:56,080
There's no way this range will hit me now, right?

2124
01:25:56,320 --> 01:26:02,220
There's no- That's a fucking long ass- WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT RANGE?!

2125
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:03,520
Okay,

2126
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:09,760
yes, that will still hit me no matter what.

2127
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:12,440
Okay.

2128
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,620
Guys, I figured it out.

2129
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:16,560
Alright.

2130
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:25,140
I'm just like, there's no way, that- there's no way the range is that far!

2131
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:26,980
There's no fucking way!

2132
01:26:33,670 --> 01:26:34,190
Okay.

2133
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:37,730
I- I didn't think his range was that far!

2134
01:26:38,470 --> 01:26:43,640
I- I thought it'd be- I thought- RANGE!

2135
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,060
How the fuck- Okay.

2136
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:49,080
I'm a- I'm actually a mess.

2137
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:50,900
I don't know how the fuck I missed that.

2138
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:54,700
WOW, DID I MISS IT TWICE?!

2139
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:55,300
NO!

2140
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,400
I'm- I'm resetting.

2141
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,240
This is not the right life.

2142
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:03,460
This is not- This- This life wasn't it.

2143
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:06,400
We gotta go to the next one.

2144
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,060
We gotta go to the next life.

2145
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:11,700
Okay, this time.

2146
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:13,940
We're okay this time.

2147
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:15,940
Alright.

2148
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:20,940
There's no way I'll miss this time.

2149
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,480
Boom, there we go.

2150
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:25,620
Alright, I figured it out for real.

2151
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,560
It's over for the big baby.

2152
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:30,440
It's fucking over.

2153
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:32,300
I figured it out this time.

2154
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:37,520
This time, we figured it out.

2155
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:40,900
It's gonna be so fucking easy.

2156
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:42,140
Alright.

2157
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:44,320
This time.

2158
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:46,500
This time, big baby.

2159
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,480
This is it.

2160
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,300
Things will be different.

2161
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:51,600
This time for real.

2162
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:54,180
It's fucking right.

2163
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:56,700
Charge.

2164
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:57,660
Boom!

2165
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:01,440
Freeze!

2166
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:04,160
That's fucking right.

2167
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:05,100
And then!

2168
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:06,700
That's right!

2169
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:08,900
Cry, you fucking baby!

2170
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:09,720
Oh!

2171
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:10,700
Yeah?

2172
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:12,760
You're gonna do nothing!

2173
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:13,680
What you gonna do?

2174
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:14,620
Nothing!

2175
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:15,440
What you gonna do?

2176
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:16,920
I'll keep dashing!

2177
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:17,880
Oh!

2178
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,420
Okay.

2179
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:19,260
Dash ended.

2180
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:23,020
Okay.

2181
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:24,620
Alright.

2182
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:26,580
That's fine.

2183
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:29,660
That's fine.

2184
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,200
That's fine.

2185
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:32,540
That's fine.

2186
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:34,520
No, that's not fine!

2187
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,060
What?

2188
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,220
I thought I dodged that!

2189
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:37,520
Okay.

2190
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:40,940
Okay.

2191
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:41,860
Oh!

2192
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:44,480
Oh!

2193
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,000
Nice!

2194
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:45,940
Good dodge!

2195
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:48,860
Okay.

2196
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:49,680
Oh!

2197
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:50,740
No!

2198
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:51,180
Oh!

2199
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:52,460
No!

2200
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,160
Oh!

2201
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:53,500
Oh!

2202
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:54,660
He clapped!

2203
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,320
Baby can clap now, too!

2204
01:28:59,320 --> 01:28:59,960
Oh, no!

2205
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:00,720
There's nothing coming out of my arm!

2206
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:03,740
Anything but that!

2207
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:08,720
Yeah, that's right.

2208
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,040
Cry.

2209
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:15,950
Oh, God.

2210
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:18,330
My...

2211
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:20,110
Oh, God.

2212
01:29:20,150 --> 01:29:20,690
We gotta leave.

2213
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:21,290
We gotta...

2214
01:29:21,290 --> 01:29:22,150
We gotta leave!

2215
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:23,230
No!

2216
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:24,290
We gotta leave!

2217
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:25,210
No!

2218
01:29:25,330 --> 01:29:25,790
No!

2219
01:29:25,810 --> 01:29:26,330
No!

2220
01:29:26,330 --> 01:29:26,710
Oh, no!

2221
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:28,790
No!

2222
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:29,530
Oh, the classes!

2223
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:32,010
Uh...

2224
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:33,010
The...

2225
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:34,130
Oh, yeah...

2226
01:29:34,130 --> 01:29:34,470
Yeah!

2227
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:36,510
The foursplash!

2228
01:29:37,290 --> 01:29:38,610
The four...

2229
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:40,930
Why is it so difficult?

2230
01:29:41,410 --> 01:29:43,030
The wolf was easier!

2231
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:46,010
The wolf was easier!

2232
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:47,710
I...

2233
01:29:47,710 --> 01:29:52,230
I was there to beat the baby!

2234
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:55,270
He doesn't even have parents!

2235
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:56,230
He can't even see us!

2236
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:56,310
I can't...

2237
01:29:58,550 --> 01:29:59,570
This is it.

2238
01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:00,730
This time.

2239
01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:03,110
Guys, I've learned.

2240
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:05,150
I figured it out for real.

2241
01:30:06,670 --> 01:30:08,050
No, I healed.

2242
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:12,390
I accidentally healed.

2243
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:16,710
No, I will not skip the baby.

2244
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:19,750
I will defeat the baby.

2245
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:24,770
There is no way.

2246
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:35,370
When I kill him, nobody will remember him because he has no family.

2247
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:38,450
That's fucking right.

2248
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:42,110
This is what I needed.

2249
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:43,950
I just needed the extra spark, guys.

2250
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:46,810
I just needed the extra spark.

2251
01:30:49,230 --> 01:30:51,290
I'll have nobody to remember me.

2252
01:30:51,310 --> 01:30:53,710
I'll have nobody to remember him by when I fucking kill him.

2253
01:30:57,110 --> 01:30:58,810
Oh my god, please.

2254
01:30:58,970 --> 01:30:59,530
Please.

2255
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:03,310
Okay, we gotta increase.

2256
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:04,670
Alright.

2257
01:31:05,110 --> 01:31:07,550
We gotta reduce the stamina.

2258
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:08,590
Maybe this is it.

2259
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:11,210
Alright.

2260
01:31:11,870 --> 01:31:12,550
Bam!

2261
01:31:14,430 --> 01:31:16,290
I will defeat the baby.

2262
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:19,470
And the baby will be no more.

2263
01:31:19,490 --> 01:31:20,030
That's right.

2264
01:31:20,030 --> 01:31:21,830
I'm talking about you, big baby.

2265
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:25,370
Everybody else has progressed through this game.

2266
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:27,730
But I'm stuck here fighting you, baby.

2267
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:34,550
Everyone else has already passed you.

2268
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:36,150
But I don't care.

2269
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:40,730
I will fucking kill this baby if it's the last thing I do.

2270
01:31:43,110 --> 01:31:44,530
I don't care.

2271
01:31:45,010 --> 01:31:47,310
This is my life mission now.

2272
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:52,550
We will kill this big...

2273
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:53,130
Oh shit!

2274
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:55,610
Oh god.

2275
01:31:58,210 --> 01:31:58,690
Please.

2276
01:32:00,030 --> 01:32:00,810
Oh god.

2277
01:32:00,870 --> 01:32:01,210
There you go.

2278
01:32:01,290 --> 01:32:01,550
We're fine.

2279
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:01,950
We're fine.

2280
01:32:05,030 --> 01:32:05,950
That's fucking right.

2281
01:32:06,010 --> 01:32:06,510
Dodge this.

2282
01:32:06,690 --> 01:32:06,850
Oh.

2283
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:09,230
Wait, what the fuck?

2284
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:13,720
I'm trying to kill a baby here.

2285
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:14,960
What are you doing here?

2286
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,900
Oh my god.

2287
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,120
What the fuck are you doing?

2288
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:20,280
What are you doing?

2289
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:22,820
Okay.

2290
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:25,120
Oh, please.

2291
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:26,960
Stop slapping me, please.

2292
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:30,920
Okay.

2293
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:32,220
No.

2294
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:32,820
Oh, no.

2295
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:33,560
Nope.

2296
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:35,080
Nope.

2297
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:38,520
Oh god.

2298
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:39,700
Oh, I have to dodge this?

2299
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:41,580
No, come at me.

2300
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:42,780
Oh, okay.

2301
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:43,560
No, come at me now.

2302
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:44,780
Okay.

2303
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:45,940
We got regenerate stamina.

2304
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:47,480
Nice.

2305
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,400
Nice.

2306
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:50,340
Okay.

2307
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:52,260
Alright.

2308
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:52,840
That's okay.

2309
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:53,400
That's good.

2310
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:56,460
Okay.

2311
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:57,960
Come on.

2312
01:32:58,300 --> 01:32:58,860
No!

2313
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,180
The fuck?

2314
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:20,190
Maybe I was never supposed to fight him anyway.

2315
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:21,770
Oh my god.

2316
01:33:25,890 --> 01:33:27,910
Maybe I was supposed to dodge.

2317
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:30,490
Maybe I was supposed to run away from him.

2318
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:32,070
We'll never know.

2319
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:33,410
It's too late.

2320
01:33:35,570 --> 01:33:36,130
Alright.

2321
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:37,590
This is it.

2322
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:38,130
No, no.

2323
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:41,410
I... I will stop spam dodging.

2324
01:33:44,730 --> 01:33:45,550
There we go.

2325
01:33:46,130 --> 01:33:50,090
The baby about to be a grown man by the time this is over.

2326
01:33:50,710 --> 01:33:51,630
This is it.

2327
01:33:53,310 --> 01:33:54,330
Baby, please.

2328
01:33:54,990 --> 01:33:55,550
Please.

2329
01:33:55,870 --> 01:33:56,910
Just baby.

2330
01:33:58,410 --> 01:33:58,970
Please.

2331
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:01,870
Nobody loves you.

2332
01:34:01,890 --> 01:34:03,550
Just let me kill you.

2333
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:04,550
I just want to live.

2334
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:06,670
You look cool in front of my dragons.

2335
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:08,910
You have nothing to...

2336
01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:10,070
Oh no!

2337
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:11,290
Am I doing worse?

2338
01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:12,550
Oh no!

2339
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:14,410
He fucking used his... fucking...

2340
01:34:14,410 --> 01:34:15,890
He used his head!

2341
01:34:19,490 --> 01:34:20,250
It's okay.

2342
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:22,330
It's okay.

2343
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:22,690
We're fine.

2344
01:34:23,930 --> 01:34:24,790
We're fine.

2345
01:34:28,110 --> 01:34:28,710
Alright.

2346
01:34:31,530 --> 01:34:32,130
Okay.

2347
01:34:32,230 --> 01:34:32,790
We did it.

2348
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:35,170
We dodged everything.

2349
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:38,410
Alright.

2350
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:39,130
Think!

2351
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:39,970
Think!

2352
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:41,070
Think!

2353
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:42,710
Think!

2354
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:44,210
Dodge!

2355
01:34:44,910 --> 01:34:49,320
I don't know how to dodge!

2356
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:52,720
It's okay.

2357
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:53,100
We're fine.

2358
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:58,860
Who are you?

2359
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:01,000
Who are you?

2360
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:04,000
What are you doing in my fight?

2361
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:04,940
Please!

2362
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,000
Use my HP!

2363
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:09,340
No!

2364
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,000
Okay.

2365
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:13,680
We're okay.

2366
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:18,760
We're okay.

2367
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:20,700
Alright.

2368
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:21,560
We're not okay.

2369
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:22,800
We're not okay.

2370
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:24,360
We're not okay.

2371
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:26,280
We're okay.

2372
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:27,420
We're not okay.

2373
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:29,360
We're okay.

2374
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:29,980
We're not.

2375
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:30,460
We're okay.

2376
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:34,080
Oh god.

2377
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:34,620
No.

2378
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:35,660
No, I'm stuck!

2379
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:38,160
No!

2380
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:38,520
Oh!

2381
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:38,980
Okay.

2382
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:39,420
That's good.

2383
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:39,820
That's fine.

2384
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:41,220
That's fine.

2385
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:44,040
I don't like where I am though.

2386
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:45,140
Where am I?

2387
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,340
Oh shit!

2388
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:46,660
No!

2389
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:47,360
Not the wolves!

2390
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:49,780
It's okay.

2391
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:50,500
He's so far.

2392
01:35:51,220 --> 01:35:52,720
There's no way he'll get to me.

2393
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:53,900
Oh fuck!

2394
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:02,420
What the fuck is my luck?

2395
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:03,540
What the...

2396
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:07,920
Holy shit.

2397
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:11,220
How did he get to me?

2398
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:12,100
How did he do it?

2399
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:13,600
How did he...

2400
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:17,040
How did he get to me?

2401
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,000
I don't understand.

2402
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:21,600
I don't understand.

2403
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,640
How did he get to me?

2404
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:29,540
Does he not have me?

2405
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:32,320
Oh my god.

2406
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:43,300
Oh my god.

2407
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:46,680
I...

2408
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:47,860
Oh my god.

2409
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:48,540
I don't see...

2410
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:51,040
What was the baby's range?

2411
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:54,800
He hasn't even gone past kindergarten.

2412
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,700
Oh my god.

2413
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:03,760
This is not looking good for me if I'm struggling so hard.

2414
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:04,960
Alright, I'm a big baby.

2415
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:09,580
Guys, my head is not looking very good for me, guys.

2416
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,520
We're still stuck in big baby territory.

2417
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:22,500
I just want to look cool, please.

2418
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:27,540
Please, everybody, there are people already.

2419
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:29,580
People already fucking unlocked.

2420
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:31,920
Junhong, please.

2421
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:37,300
They unlocked him already and I'm still stuck in baby level.

2422
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:42,180
I'm still in baby level.

2423
01:37:47,310 --> 01:37:51,790
They already freed him from the fucking rock and I'm still here.

2424
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:54,970
I'm still here.

2425
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:04,030
Are you serious?

2426
01:38:04,130 --> 01:38:05,510
Oh my god.

2427
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:09,070
I need a time that... I keep forgetting how to time it.

2428
01:38:09,610 --> 01:38:10,410
Oh, nice.

2429
01:38:11,990 --> 01:38:12,390
Okay.

2430
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:14,670
Oh, yeah, there we go.

2431
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:15,570
No, no, no, no, no.

2432
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:16,490
Okay.

2433
01:38:17,530 --> 01:38:17,930
Nice.

2434
01:38:18,950 --> 01:38:20,590
No, the headbutt!

2435
01:38:21,290 --> 01:38:24,310
Why does he use the headbutt and why does he not headbutt?

2436
01:38:24,850 --> 01:38:25,250
Okay.

2437
01:38:25,970 --> 01:38:26,370
Alright.

2438
01:38:29,630 --> 01:38:30,030
Okay.

2439
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:32,950
Oh, god.

2440
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:33,850
Alright.

2441
01:38:34,970 --> 01:38:35,550
Okay.

2442
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:36,590
No!

2443
01:38:37,490 --> 01:38:40,230
It's always a Kamehameha force punch!

2444
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:44,290
Oh, god.

2445
01:38:45,710 --> 01:38:48,190
I know this range is fucking crazy, too.

2446
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:49,710
Alright.

2447
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:52,710
I'm getting better, guys!

2448
01:38:53,570 --> 01:38:54,850
Guys, is this possible?

2449
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:55,890
I'm actually improving?

2450
01:38:59,050 --> 01:38:59,630
Yes!

2451
01:39:00,530 --> 01:39:01,110
Yes!

2452
01:39:02,470 --> 01:39:02,910
Yes!

2453
01:39:04,130 --> 01:39:06,010
Oh, I dodged it!

2454
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:06,390
I did it!

2455
01:39:08,210 --> 01:39:08,650
Okay.

2456
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:10,050
Okay.

2457
01:39:12,290 --> 01:39:13,950
There's no way he's gonna headbutt this time.

2458
01:39:14,470 --> 01:39:14,910
No!

2459
01:39:15,170 --> 01:39:15,610
Okay.

2460
01:39:16,430 --> 01:39:16,870
Alright.

2461
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:20,070
Guys, I cannot choose the alert.

2462
01:39:22,010 --> 01:39:23,230
Oh, please, no.

2463
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:24,970
No, please.

2464
01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:27,770
Please.

2465
01:39:28,610 --> 01:39:29,050
Oh, god.

2466
01:39:30,410 --> 01:39:30,850
Oh, god.

2467
01:39:30,850 --> 01:39:30,890
Oh, god.

2468
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:31,710
Oh, no.

2469
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:32,370
It's this...

2470
01:39:32,690 --> 01:39:33,630
It's this move!

2471
01:39:34,130 --> 01:39:34,790
Oh!

2472
01:39:36,670 --> 01:39:37,470
Okay.

2473
01:39:37,690 --> 01:39:38,490
Alright.

2474
01:39:39,430 --> 01:39:40,230
Alright.

2475
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:42,570
Okay.

2476
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:43,490
Here we go.

2477
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:48,940
Please.

2478
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:50,140
Oh!

2479
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:51,540
No!

2480
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:54,520
Come on!

2481
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:55,520
No!

2482
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,500
He jumped!

2483
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:06,340
He broke my groove!

2484
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:07,280
Oh, god.

2485
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:09,320
He didn't jump before!

2486
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:13,740
Dang!

2487
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:16,700
I fumbled the jump!

2488
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:18,460
No!

2489
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:20,380
Oh, please!

2490
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:21,820
Wait!

2491
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:22,500
But that...

2492
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:23,640
I'm learning, though!

2493
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:24,760
I'm learning!

2494
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:26,500
Oh, please.

2495
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:27,800
Okay.

2496
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:28,620
That's...

2497
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:28,920
Guys!

2498
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:30,840
Guys, I downloaded it.

2499
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,240
I think I've dow...

2500
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:35,140
Guys, I've downloaded it for real this time.

2501
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:37,620
I am learning.

2502
01:40:37,780 --> 01:40:40,020
I am learning so much!

2503
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:40,640
Thank you!

2504
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:46,160
Everybody's like, please Doki, please just break the Monkey King from the rock already.

2505
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:48,500
No, this is more important.

2506
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:50,720
I need to teach a child a lesson.

2507
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:55,000
I need to make sure that baby never graduates kindergarten.

2508
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:58,640
That is my only purpose in life.

2509
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:04,340
Literally my only purpose in life is this baby to never find love.

2510
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,840
You can never find love, baby.

2511
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:12,100
Ow.

2512
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:15,380
Oh, please.

2513
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:19,900
No, I'm messing it up.

2514
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:22,300
Oh, God.

2515
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:25,680
Okay.

2516
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:27,820
Alright.

2517
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:29,820
Okay, nice.

2518
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:33,500
No, not nice.

2519
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:34,320
Okay.

2520
01:41:34,340 --> 01:41:35,360
Okay.

2521
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:37,480
Come on.

2522
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:39,700
Okay.

2523
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:41,520
Alright.

2524
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:42,980
Nice.

2525
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:44,240
No!

2526
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:45,880
The double

2527
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:50,580
makes up!

2528
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,440
The fucking makes up!

2529
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:57,120
Yes!

2530
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,740
The fucking makes up!

2531
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:06,880
Alright, we all know that was not the run.

2532
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,460
I fucked up the wolf power.

2533
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:11,540
I actually fucked up.

2534
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:14,240
I fucked up the wolf power.

2535
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:16,940
Okay.

2536
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:19,140
It's okay.

2537
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:22,480
I'm doing less spam dodges now.

2538
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:25,420
I'm locked in.

2539
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:26,720
This is the run.

2540
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:29,680
I'm spamming less.

2541
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:31,980
That's when you know I'm locked in.

2542
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:33,180
Okay.

2543
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:34,660
That's good.

2544
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:35,660
We're smart.

2545
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:41,040
It's gonna be like overpowered as hell by the time I get there.

2546
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:44,620
Okay.

2547
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:45,760
Let's see.

2548
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:46,880
Alright.

2549
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:48,700
Alright.

2550
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:49,480
Let's see.

2551
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:52,620
The Read House does support himself with a stack avoiding ground attacks.

2552
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:53,760
Wait!

2553
01:42:55,180 --> 01:42:56,160
Maybe this is it!

2554
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:01,220
Wait.

2555
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:01,580
This is it?

2556
01:43:01,620 --> 01:43:02,240
Maybe this is it!

2557
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:06,060
Maybe this is it!

2558
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:09,780
This is all I need to do!

2559
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:16,640
I fucked up.

2560
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:17,000
I fucked up.

2561
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:17,500
Ah, fuck.

2562
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:17,960
Wait, what?

2563
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:24,780
Oh shit!

2564
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:27,260
Okay, yeah, maybe that is what I do.

2565
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:28,520
Okay.

2566
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:33,240
That's fucking right.

2567
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:34,380
That's fucking right!

2568
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:37,580
Okay.

2569
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,520
That's fucking right.

2570
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:42,140
Oh shit!

2571
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:42,580
Okay.

2572
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:43,480
Oh, okay.

2573
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:44,920
Okay.

2574
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:45,280
Okay.

2575
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:52,480
That's very unlucky for Wolfman.

2576
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:56,500
Oh fuck, okay.

2577
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:57,400
It's alright.

2578
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,440
I figured it out though.

2579
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:06,020
That's fucking right!

2580
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:07,540
Wait, I think I figured it out!

2581
01:44:11,090 --> 01:44:12,310
Okay, we gotta regen.

2582
01:44:13,150 --> 01:44:14,350
Wait, I think I figured it out.

2583
01:44:14,950 --> 01:44:16,410
I think I figured it out, guys.

2584
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:23,590
No!

2585
01:44:23,730 --> 01:44:24,290
No!

2586
01:44:24,730 --> 01:44:25,290
No!

2587
01:44:25,530 --> 01:44:25,750
No!

2588
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:26,270
No!

2589
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:32,260
Oh god.

2590
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:33,160
No.

2591
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:34,360
Please.

2592
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:39,600
No, he smacked me.

2593
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,320
Holy shit!

2594
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:43,460
I think I figured it out though!

2595
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:48,620
I think I figured it out!

2596
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:50,940
Oh!

2597
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:52,180
Oh!

2598
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:04,040
I thought that was a ground move!

2599
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:06,820
I was like, I'm up here!

2600
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:08,760
You can't get me!

2601
01:45:09,810 --> 01:45:11,840
I legit thought I was...

2602
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:14,900
I thought I was... I thought I was in the air!

2603
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:19,600
He literally... The game literally was like, Whoa, when you're in the air...

2604
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,460
When you're in the air...

2605
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:23,200
When you're in the air...

2606
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:25,120
You don't have to worry about...

2607
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:26,220
When you're in the air!

2608
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:32,260
You won't get hit by ground attacks!

2609
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:40,440
It didn't work that you swung.

2610
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:45,800
How was I supposed to know I swung my...

2611
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:50,740
I just thought I was in the air!

2612
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:54,140
I thought I was... I made it!

2613
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:55,360
Hello.

2614
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:57,720
No, you're supposed to get closer.

2615
01:45:58,280 --> 01:45:59,280
Oh thank god.

2616
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:01,760
Okay.

2617
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:03,900
It's fine.

2618
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:06,500
We're fine.

2619
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:11,780
Oh god.

2620
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:13,800
It's fine.

2621
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:15,020
We're fine.

2622
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:18,220
And then dash!

2623
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:20,660
Oh, this is not fine now.

2624
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:21,800
Alright.

2625
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:23,480
We're fine.

2626
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:27,720
That's fucking right.

2627
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:29,540
Oh, he swung!

2628
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:30,700
Okay,

2629
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:34,980
that's fine.

2630
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:36,520
And then...

2631
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:39,460
Oh shit, okay.

2632
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:41,000
Swing!

2633
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:42,360
Swing!

2634
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:42,640
No!

2635
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,880
I thought I timed it correctly!

2636
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:47,100
Okay.

2637
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:48,720
We're fine.

2638
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,360
Boom!

2639
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:55,800
That's fucking right, baby!

2640
01:46:56,820 --> 01:46:57,860
That's fucking right!

2641
01:46:58,120 --> 01:46:59,520
Nobody loves you!

2642
01:47:00,820 --> 01:47:02,040
Where are your parents?!

2643
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:03,300
Oh, you don't have one!

2644
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:05,100
Boom!

2645
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:05,740
Oh shit.

2646
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:06,320
I'm so sorry.

2647
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:06,800
I'm so sorry.

2648
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:08,680
Boom!

2649
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:17,360
Oh shit!

2650
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:19,240
What?!

2651
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:20,620
No!

2652
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:22,480
I timed it!

2653
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:25,200
The very first time I ever timed it!

2654
01:47:28,580 --> 01:47:30,040
Oh no.

2655
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,100
Please.

2656
01:47:42,270 --> 01:47:46,090
And then a flash-tag comes unexpectedly!

2657
01:47:49,870 --> 01:47:54,850
It always shows up when I least expect it!

2658
01:47:57,710 --> 01:48:02,590
Why does it always show up when I least get over it?

2659
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:13,250
I'm so angry.

2660
01:48:15,290 --> 01:48:18,170
Oh no, my one HP.

2661
01:48:18,410 --> 01:48:19,450
I don't care.

2662
01:48:20,090 --> 01:48:23,250
That one spec is not going to change anything.

2663
01:48:26,530 --> 01:48:27,570
This is it.

2664
01:48:28,690 --> 01:48:30,070
This is it.

2665
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:32,230
That was the closest I've ever been.

2666
01:48:33,130 --> 01:48:34,430
That was the closest.

2667
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:36,710
This is it.

2668
01:48:36,790 --> 01:48:37,590
There's no way.

2669
01:48:39,130 --> 01:48:40,430
There's no fucking way.

2670
01:48:40,510 --> 01:48:41,650
There's no fucking way.

2671
01:48:45,270 --> 01:48:45,750
Boom.

2672
01:48:48,570 --> 01:48:49,050
Okay.

2673
01:48:50,950 --> 01:48:51,490
All right.

2674
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:54,650
That's fucking right.

2675
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:56,110
That's fucking right.

2676
01:48:58,250 --> 01:48:58,950
Oh god.

2677
01:48:59,970 --> 01:49:00,450
Boom.

2678
01:49:00,910 --> 01:49:01,390
Boom.

2679
01:49:02,590 --> 01:49:03,170
Boom.

2680
01:49:03,650 --> 01:49:04,230
Boom.

2681
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:05,790
Boom.

2682
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:07,770
God.

2683
01:49:07,930 --> 01:49:08,210
Okay.

2684
01:49:09,450 --> 01:49:10,170
All right.

2685
01:49:10,590 --> 01:49:11,350
That's fine.

2686
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:16,520
That's fucking right.

2687
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:18,720
That's fucking right.

2688
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:21,880
That's right.

2689
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:23,980
Stay on the ground, you big baby.

2690
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:26,720
What are you going to do?

2691
01:49:26,860 --> 01:49:27,260
Yeah?

2692
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:27,720
Clap?

2693
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:29,960
Nobody loves you.

2694
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:32,580
Oh!

2695
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:35,980
That's so... I didn't mean to.

2696
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:35,980
I didn't mean to.

2697
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:35,980
I didn't mean to.

2698
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:35,980
I didn't mean to.

2699
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:35,980
I didn't mean to.

2700
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:35,980
I didn't mean to.

2701
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:35,980
I didn't mean to.

2702
01:49:49,550 --> 01:49:51,630
Oh, holy shit.

2703
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:53,530
I didn't mean that!

2704
01:49:53,670 --> 01:49:54,490
I'm sorry.

2705
01:49:55,170 --> 01:49:57,630
I am so sorry.

2706
01:49:58,870 --> 01:50:00,590
We need some more voices.

2707
01:50:00,970 --> 01:50:03,730
We need to kill him if he's Fahrenheit.

2708
01:50:04,150 --> 01:50:05,410
I don't care.

2709
01:50:05,510 --> 01:50:07,110
I just want to kill him.

2710
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:07,910
All right.

2711
01:50:09,790 --> 01:50:11,070
Here is that one.

2712
01:50:11,070 --> 01:50:13,850
We have to kill him if it's the last thing we do.

2713
01:50:14,090 --> 01:50:16,850
And we have to kill him.

2714
01:50:18,010 --> 01:50:19,130
We're locking it in.

2715
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:20,070
I'm full focus now.

2716
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:22,370
I'm so full focus.

2717
01:50:22,590 --> 01:50:24,330
You have no idea how focused I am.

2718
01:50:24,990 --> 01:50:25,510
Alright.

2719
01:50:26,590 --> 01:50:27,110
Alright.

2720
01:50:28,190 --> 01:50:29,370
Okay, it's personal now.

2721
01:50:29,450 --> 01:50:30,230
Okay, full focus.

2722
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:30,690
Chat.

2723
01:50:32,330 --> 01:50:33,370
Holy shit.

2724
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:37,350
We have not progressed this game.

2725
01:50:37,830 --> 01:50:40,570
We've been stuck on this stupid ass baby.

2726
01:50:41,790 --> 01:50:43,050
Oh yeah, please.

2727
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:47,790
Oh my god.

2728
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:54,110
I just want to get this guy out of my lobby, please.

2729
01:50:56,410 --> 01:50:57,090
Please.

2730
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:04,350
Okay, nice.

2731
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:09,300
Okay.

2732
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:11,120
Boom.

2733
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:11,800
Boom.

2734
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:13,960
Okay.

2735
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:15,880
Okay.

2736
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:16,900
What?

2737
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:21,020
Why does he jump?

2738
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:24,340
Okay.

2739
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:26,380
Oh, it's a big one.

2740
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:28,860
Oh.

2741
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:31,060
Okay.

2742
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:33,300
Stupid fucking baby.

2743
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:35,540
Stupid baby.

2744
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:40,020
Are you serious?

2745
01:51:42,820 --> 01:51:43,240
Okay.

2746
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:45,260
Come on.

2747
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:45,700
Come on.

2748
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:46,160
Come on.

2749
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:46,820
Come on, you guys.

2750
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:49,080
Yes.

2751
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:49,380
No.

2752
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:50,480
He collapsed.

2753
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:52,820
Okay.

2754
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,500
Oh, why do you have to clap?

2755
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:00,980
Why do you have to clap?

2756
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:04,780
Stop clapping.

2757
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:06,620
It's not cool.

2758
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:08,720
Okay.

2759
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:12,340
What?

2760
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:13,220
What?

2761
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:16,100
Who was that?

2762
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:17,460
No.

2763
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:18,080
No!

2764
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:18,600
I activated!

2765
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:19,180
No!

2766
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:20,020
I activated!

2767
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:21,720
He keeps clapping!

2768
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:24,740
He keeps clapping!

2769
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:32,040
Why are we still here?

2770
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:34,960
Why are we still here?

2771
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:41,600
Why are we still here?

2772
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:41,980
Focus!

2773
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:44,580
I wasn't full focus, chat.

2774
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:44,940
I'm trying to focus.

2775
01:52:44,940 --> 01:52:45,140
I lied.

2776
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:46,140
Now I am.

2777
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:47,980
Now I am.

2778
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:50,780
Why are we still here?

2779
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:51,820
Just to suffer?

2780
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:53,680
Alright.

2781
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:58,040
This is it.

2782
01:52:58,760 --> 01:52:59,540
This is it.

2783
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:02,180
This is it.

2784
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:04,940
This is it.

2785
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:06,380
We learned.

2786
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:08,740
We are so much...

2787
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:08,880
No!

2788
01:53:10,540 --> 01:53:12,440
I got cocky!

2789
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:15,360
This is the entire game.

2790
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:17,020
Okay.

2791
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:18,140
I'm focused now.

2792
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:22,360
There's no...

2793
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:23,920
Alright, you idiot.

2794
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:25,320
That's right.

2795
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:25,820
You cry.

2796
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:27,560
Cry more.

2797
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:29,000
No!

2798
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:30,320
Guys!

2799
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:31,620
Oh my god!

2800
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:33,080
Oh shit!

2801
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,280
Alright.

2802
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:43,080
What?

2803
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:46,280
Are you...

2804
01:53:46,300 --> 01:53:47,240
Are you fucking kidding me?

2805
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:48,540
Okay.

2806
01:53:49,060 --> 01:53:49,940
It's okay.

2807
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:51,480
It'll be fine.

2808
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:53,360
It'll be so fine.

2809
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:57,020
Alright.

2810
01:53:58,620 --> 01:53:59,340
Dodge!

2811
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:00,780
Are you... Dodge!

2812
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:02,220
Dodge!

2813
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:04,800
Alright.

2814
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:09,430
Dodge, okay.

2815
01:54:12,830 --> 01:54:13,550
Dodge!

2816
01:54:13,870 --> 01:54:14,450
Alright.

2817
01:54:14,930 --> 01:54:15,770
Here we go.

2818
01:54:18,150 --> 01:54:18,910
Okay, nice.

2819
01:54:23,950 --> 01:54:24,850
Nice, okay.

2820
01:54:33,230 --> 01:54:33,830
Alright.

2821
01:54:35,850 --> 01:54:36,450
No!

2822
01:54:36,610 --> 01:54:37,390
Oh, thank god.

2823
01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:48,590
Okay.

2824
01:54:49,410 --> 01:54:50,370
Keep crying.

2825
01:54:50,590 --> 01:54:51,710
Keep crying, baby.

2826
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:53,690
Okay.

2827
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:09,640
No!

2828
01:55:12,890 --> 01:55:13,490
Okay.

2829
01:55:18,510 --> 01:55:19,110
Okay.

2830
01:55:20,250 --> 01:55:20,850
Like,

2831
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:31,800
I'll hit him!

2832
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:32,660
I'll pin him!

2833
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:33,520
I'll break it!

2834
01:55:34,020 --> 01:55:35,740
I actually got...

2835
01:55:35,740 --> 01:55:37,720
I got too greedy!

2836
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:41,040
I was gonna...

2837
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,320
I cried and I keep being too greedy!

2838
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:46,000
I was gonna...

2839
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,620
I was gonna try to do the monkey stance!

2840
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:52,300
I wanted to do the monkey stance!

2841
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:54,460
I wanted to do the monkey stance!

2842
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:56,480
Oh my god.

2843
01:55:56,900 --> 01:55:57,660
No!

2844
01:55:59,180 --> 01:55:59,940
Alright.

2845
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:01,600
This is it.

2846
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:02,320
This is it.

2847
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:03,980
I was so fucking...

2848
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:07,700
I was so fucking locked in, too!

2849
01:56:07,980 --> 01:56:09,760
But then I was like, hee hee monkey!

2850
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:12,180
Hee hee monkey!

2851
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:14,860
Why do I hee hee monkey?

2852
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:17,940
I didn't have the monkey!

2853
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:23,320
I didn't have the monkey!

2854
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:27,340
Why do I do this to myself?

2855
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:29,540
Why do I do this to myself?

2856
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:31,700
Why did I saw hee hee monkey for me?

2857
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:34,000
Why did I saw hee hee monkey for me?

2858
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:34,500
Britney!

2859
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:39,960
I just thought it'd be funny!

2860
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:44,500
I literally thought it'd...

2861
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:45,120
be funny!

2862
01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:50,940
Okay.

2863
01:56:53,720 --> 01:56:54,880
Okay.

2864
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:56,140
Fire!

2865
01:56:56,380 --> 01:56:57,120
Fire!

2866
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:58,680
Fire!

2867
01:56:59,260 --> 01:56:59,800
Fire!

2868
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:00,780
No!

2869
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:00,980
Oh no!

2870
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:03,540
Dash!

2871
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:06,960
What?!

2872
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:07,820
Okay.

2873
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:11,680
Okay.

2874
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:14,860
Okay, nice.

2875
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:17,040
No!

2876
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:21,120
Okay, nice.

2877
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:24,280
Come on.

2878
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:27,080
Nice, okay.

2879
01:57:29,900 --> 01:57:30,560
No!

2880
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:31,340
Dash.

2881
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:35,750
No!

2882
01:57:52,230 --> 01:57:53,690
Oh my god.

2883
01:57:53,770 --> 01:57:54,730
I fucking...

2884
01:57:54,730 --> 01:57:55,450
Fuck you.

2885
01:57:55,570 --> 01:57:58,970
I hope you'll never reincarnate and be dead forever.

2886
01:58:01,210 --> 01:58:02,950
Oh my god.

2887
01:58:03,570 --> 01:58:04,990
Can not!

2888
01:58:05,010 --> 01:58:06,310
What do you...

2889
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:07,890
What do you mean with all guidance?

2890
01:58:08,110 --> 01:58:09,990
Why can't I absorb this?

2891
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:11,650
Why can't I...

2892
01:58:11,650 --> 01:58:12,770
What do you mean?

2893
01:58:13,190 --> 01:58:13,910
Please!

2894
01:58:15,350 --> 01:58:15,710
Please!

2895
01:58:17,170 --> 01:58:19,550
I can't even take this!

2896
01:58:20,130 --> 01:58:21,210
I can't!

2897
01:58:21,710 --> 01:58:27,510
I wasn't even supposed to kill Big Baby!

2898
01:58:28,170 --> 01:58:30,590
What do you mean I can't take this?

2899
01:58:30,810 --> 01:58:33,910
I wasn't even supposed to kill him!

2900
01:58:34,290 --> 01:58:36,970
I can't even kill him!

2901
01:58:37,170 --> 01:58:38,490
I'm sorry, but...

2902
01:58:40,190 --> 01:58:42,630
I am so fucked up!

2903
01:58:43,110 --> 01:58:45,430
I am so fucked!

2904
01:58:47,290 --> 01:58:50,990
I'm too low level to absorb the loot!

2905
01:58:51,370 --> 01:58:53,710
I can't believe it!

2906
01:58:53,850 --> 01:58:56,250
Why did I do this to myself?

2907
01:58:58,090 --> 01:59:01,530
I killed him, but at what cost?

2908
01:59:01,790 --> 01:59:04,130
It doesn't even feel like I won!

2909
01:59:07,590 --> 01:59:10,810
It doesn't even feel like I won!

2910
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:14,290
He still won!

2911
01:59:14,550 --> 01:59:17,110
I can't even take this!

2912
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:18,130
No!

2913
01:59:20,430 --> 01:59:22,250
Oh my god!

2914
01:59:22,370 --> 01:59:24,530
Down goes the baby!

2915
01:59:24,750 --> 01:59:27,270
After like, thank you for the akasufa.

2916
01:59:27,290 --> 01:59:28,290
Thank you, thank you!

2917
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:37,150
Oh my god, I did all that and I said I can't even absorb the fucking baby.

2918
01:59:37,790 --> 01:59:38,510
Oh!

2919
01:59:38,630 --> 01:59:38,990
Fuck me!

2920
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:42,750
Oh my god.

2921
01:59:42,990 --> 01:59:46,710
My hate for baby has failed me yet again.

2922
01:59:50,630 --> 01:59:53,670
Oh, thank you for the akasupa.

2923
01:59:53,690 --> 01:59:55,010
Thank you, thank you.

2924
01:59:55,850 --> 01:59:58,950
Won the battle but lost the war.

2925
02:00:02,190 --> 02:00:03,930
Oh my god, what are you going to do?

2926
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:05,190
Fucking kill me?

2927
02:00:05,510 --> 02:00:07,510
I fucking killed a baby today.

2928
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:09,610
You think I'm scared of you?

2929
02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:12,610
Oh shit, new guy.

2930
02:00:13,190 --> 02:00:13,970
What is this?

2931
02:00:14,090 --> 02:00:15,090
The wolf sentinel.

2932
02:00:15,410 --> 02:00:15,850
Okay.

2933
02:00:16,350 --> 02:00:17,990
Oh shit, what the fuck did I do?

2934
02:00:19,290 --> 02:00:20,150
Oh god.

2935
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:23,010
I'm fucking going to stand up here.

2936
02:00:23,190 --> 02:00:23,630
What are you going to do?

2937
02:00:23,710 --> 02:00:24,150
Nothing.

2938
02:00:24,830 --> 02:00:25,710
Nearly nothing.

2939
02:00:26,170 --> 02:00:26,750
Can't do...

2940
02:00:26,750 --> 02:00:27,830
That's looking right.

2941
02:00:27,890 --> 02:00:28,270
Shoot me.

2942
02:00:28,350 --> 02:00:29,710
Oh wait, he shot me up here.

2943
02:00:32,690 --> 02:00:37,030
Robbed and my total death to baby is 14 for a grand total of 18.

2944
02:00:37,510 --> 02:00:39,130
Oh my god.

2945
02:00:39,250 --> 02:00:43,210
I think I spent so much time on the fucking baby.

2946
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:48,930
Everybody else has already saved... like unlocked the monkey king and I'm still here.

2947
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:52,900
Which one?

2948
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:55,600
This one?

2949
02:00:57,660 --> 02:01:00,140
We haven't even heard him fucking talk.

2950
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:08,070
Get away while I... wait, where the fuck is the...

2951
02:01:08,070 --> 02:01:09,690
Oh, there we go.

2952
02:01:09,770 --> 02:01:10,650
There's the incense.

2953
02:01:15,170 --> 02:01:16,810
Everyone's so far ahead.

2954
02:01:20,770 --> 02:01:24,290
Everyone is already so far... I can grab the armor.

2955
02:01:24,370 --> 02:01:25,190
Let's go.

2956
02:01:26,870 --> 02:01:28,530
It's making a go.

2957
02:01:30,910 --> 02:01:32,430
Holy shit.

2958
02:01:32,550 --> 02:01:33,750
Fucking father.

2959
02:01:34,430 --> 02:01:35,730
I can't.

2960
02:01:38,070 --> 02:01:39,310
Yeah, that's mine as well.

2961
02:01:39,970 --> 02:01:41,850
Mine is fucking well.

2962
02:01:43,030 --> 02:01:43,570
Alright.

2963
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:45,710
Examine.

2964
02:01:45,870 --> 02:01:48,910
Wait, how is this like better than what I have?

2965
02:01:50,530 --> 02:01:51,730
Alright, let's see.

2966
02:01:51,830 --> 02:01:53,630
This is 14.

2967
02:01:53,870 --> 02:01:54,810
Oh, it is better.

2968
02:01:55,030 --> 02:01:55,470
Okay.

2969
02:02:00,950 --> 02:02:04,250
You never... you didn't even have to beat the baby, guys.

2970
02:02:04,690 --> 02:02:06,010
That's the best part.

2971
02:02:06,010 --> 02:02:09,170
We didn't have to kill the baby.

2972
02:02:11,630 --> 02:02:15,150
We... we didn't have to kill the baby.

2973
02:02:18,170 --> 02:02:23,030
You can get the baby spirit later from the keeper's shrine once you get the ability to absorb spirits.

2974
02:02:25,590 --> 02:02:26,250
Uhhh...

2975
02:02:31,890 --> 02:02:32,550
Uhhh...

2976
02:02:32,550 --> 02:02:33,670
Uhhh...

2977
02:02:35,670 --> 02:02:37,930
Just joking around babies.

2978
02:02:38,510 --> 02:02:40,270
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

2979
02:02:40,370 --> 02:02:40,750
Thank you.

2980
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:41,330
Thank you.

2981
02:02:43,710 --> 02:02:51,910
I could have been so high leveled by the time I fight the baby that the baby wouldn't even be difficult.

2982
02:02:54,350 --> 02:03:00,990
The baby wouldn't have been difficult by the time I'm at the level where I can absorb the baby.

2983
02:03:03,670 --> 02:03:05,110
Was it worth it?

2984
02:03:09,270 --> 02:03:12,230
This basically justifies my hate for babies.

2985
02:03:16,030 --> 02:03:18,230
This just means I was right.

2986
02:03:18,790 --> 02:03:20,350
Babies don't deserve anything.

2987
02:03:22,650 --> 02:03:23,250
Alright.

2988
02:03:25,650 --> 02:03:27,090
Alright, here we go.

2989
02:03:29,610 --> 02:03:33,130
Guys, the baby basically forced me to actually dodge.

2990
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:37,870
The baby forced me to learn mechanics.

2991
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:43,700
Alright, let's see.

2992
02:03:46,980 --> 02:03:48,280
Where do I go?

2993
02:03:49,300 --> 02:03:50,720
I guess I go up.

2994
02:03:50,740 --> 02:03:53,280
I wanna like see if there's extra loot anywhere.

2995
02:03:53,460 --> 02:03:53,960
Oh, there is.

2996
02:03:57,220 --> 02:03:58,620
Will it respawn?

2997
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:00,440
No.

2998
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:03,000
No, don't say that.

2999
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:04,720
No.

3000
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:08,180
No, don't say that.

3001
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:10,320
Did it actually respawn?

3002
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:12,000
There's no f***ing way.

3003
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:15,460
There's no f***ing way.

3004
02:04:17,480 --> 02:04:18,260
Did I rest?

3005
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:20,300
Oh my god, I didn't rest.

3006
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:20,900
Let me rest.

3007
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:23,220
Oh, that would be so f***ed up.

3008
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:27,200
That would actually be so f***ed up after everything I did today.

3009
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:29,560
And the baby f***ing comes back.

3010
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:33,960
And the baby f***ing comes back.

3011
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:35,880
I didn't even get a chance to absorb him.

3012
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:37,040
Okay.

3013
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:40,060
Alright, we find out now.

3014
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:43,980
I'm gonna travel.

3015
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:47,180
Alright.

3016
02:04:47,860 --> 02:04:51,060
I don't like how the baby's there, but okay.

3017
02:04:56,380 --> 02:04:56,940
Alright.

3018
02:04:56,940 --> 02:04:57,260
Alright.

3019
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:01,740
Alright.

3020
02:05:03,880 --> 02:05:06,360
Is God really that cruel?

3021
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:10,080
Is he really that cruel?

3022
02:05:12,610 --> 02:05:14,380
We'll find out today.

3023
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:17,760
Alright.

3024
02:05:19,790 --> 02:05:20,760
Is he back?

3025
02:05:21,940 --> 02:05:23,300
Is he back?

3026
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:25,840
He's gone!

3027
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:28,660
But where's the spirit?

3028
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:31,440
Where did the Luke...

3029
02:05:36,810 --> 02:05:37,970
Where...

3030
02:05:38,610 --> 02:05:40,670
Where did the Luke go?

3031
02:05:41,170 --> 02:05:43,290
The soul is gone.

3032
02:05:44,150 --> 02:05:48,550
Where did the soul go?

3033
02:05:50,870 --> 02:05:51,450
No!

3034
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:56,440
No.

3035
02:06:01,780 --> 02:06:02,360
Alright.

3036
02:06:04,120 --> 02:06:06,320
Life is a cruel joke.

3037
02:06:06,580 --> 02:06:10,460
Life truly is a cruel joke.

3038
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:17,920
But we finally unlock Wukong and find out soon!

3039
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:23,440
The baby won in the end!

3040
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:29,820
In the end.

3041
02:06:30,510 --> 02:06:31,840
The baby won.

3042
02:06:32,700 --> 02:06:33,880
The baby won.

3043
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:35,680
A person with no reincarnation.

3044
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:37,320
Of course, he's god-cast.

3045
02:06:37,420 --> 02:06:38,300
Thank you for the super chat.

3046
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:39,260
Thank you, thank you.

3047
02:06:42,140 --> 02:06:45,240
Oh my god, what's the worst thing that can happen in my day?

3048
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:49,660
Damn this soldier.

3049
02:06:49,740 --> 02:06:51,780
Oh my god, big, big boy.

3050
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:53,420
Big wolf boy.

3051
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:55,820
I fucking- Whoa!

3052
02:06:56,600 --> 02:06:58,240
Oh god, oh god.

3053
02:06:58,700 --> 02:07:01,160
Oh god, I nearly just killed the baby.

3054
02:07:01,160 --> 02:07:03,180
And then now I have to kill the wolf?

3055
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:05,320
Can I not rest?

3056
02:07:07,140 --> 02:07:09,140
What the fuck does that do?

3057
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:15,580
Oh shit, now I have to learn new movesets already?

3058
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:21,780
I just got out of a boss fight.

3059
02:07:23,400 --> 02:07:24,600
Holy shit.

3060
02:07:24,700 --> 02:07:26,120
Can I not rest?

3061
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:28,700
I have to learn a new move.

3062
02:07:29,320 --> 02:07:31,140
I have to learn new moves.

3063
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:31,580
I have to learn new combos.

3064
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:34,960
Are you fucking kidding me?

3065
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:36,780
Oh god.

3066
02:07:41,730 --> 02:07:43,660
Shit, what the fuck?

3067
02:07:43,940 --> 02:07:46,440
What the fuck is this?

3068
02:07:47,220 --> 02:07:48,420
Oh god.

3069
02:07:51,030 --> 02:07:51,520
Okay.

3070
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:53,760
Alright.

3071
02:07:55,770 --> 02:07:56,600
Okay, nice.

3072
02:07:58,770 --> 02:07:59,260
Alright.

3073
02:08:01,160 --> 02:08:01,740
Alright.

3074
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:03,340
Oh no.

3075
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:03,860
Whoa!

3076
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:06,840
Oh my god!

3077
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:08,360
He's so strong!

3078
02:08:11,160 --> 02:08:11,880
Whoaaaa!

3079
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:24,940
I just got back from learning baby combos.

3080
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:26,740
Now I need to learn wolf combos.

3081
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,160
right off the bat.

3082
02:08:32,380 --> 02:08:32,900
Okay.

3083
02:08:32,900 --> 02:08:36,320
The fucking potato lied.

3084
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:37,820
He said there's no going back.

3085
02:08:37,940 --> 02:08:39,220
There's clearly going back.

3086
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:42,040
Okay.

3087
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:43,160
Let's fucking get closer.

3088
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:46,040
Oh!

3089
02:08:46,180 --> 02:08:47,260
Oh, I deserve that!

3090
02:08:47,420 --> 02:08:48,340
I deserve that!

3091
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:49,640
I deserve that!

3092
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:50,720
Oh, I get closer.

3093
02:08:55,610 --> 02:08:56,130
Oh.

3094
02:08:56,690 --> 02:08:57,830
Wait, that's the thing?

3095
02:08:58,530 --> 02:08:59,530
Oh, okay.

3096
02:08:59,810 --> 02:09:00,330
Okay.

3097
02:09:01,010 --> 02:09:02,510
Yeah, I'm gonna leave.

3098
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:09,480
I didn't realize I can't hold it!

3099
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:12,980
I didn't realize I could fall over!

3100
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:18,520
I thought I could stay on high ground forever!

3101
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:20,660
I just fell!

3102
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:29,380
Okay, that was... I mean, that was deserved, honestly.

3103
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:31,060
Yeah, there's...

3104
02:09:31,060 --> 02:09:31,840
Yeah.

3105
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:36,240
Yeah, I deserve that.

3106
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:38,300
I 100%.

3107
02:09:38,300 --> 02:09:40,980
I 100% deserve that.

3108
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:43,980
That's fucking right.

3109
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:46,220
Wolf versus wolf!

3110
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:47,760
Wolf versus wolf!

3111
02:09:51,140 --> 02:09:52,440
What are you gonna do, huh?

3112
02:09:53,260 --> 02:09:54,760
Get down from here!

3113
02:09:55,980 --> 02:09:57,080
Get down!

3114
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,260
What are you gonna do, huh?

3115
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:00,920
I beat a baby!

3116
02:10:01,100 --> 02:10:01,200
I...

3117
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:02,580
I kicked a baby!

3118
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:03,580
It's time to kick a dog!

3119
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:06,000
I might as well... Oh, shit!

3120
02:10:06,120 --> 02:10:06,880
Dogs can slap!

3121
02:10:08,900 --> 02:10:09,820
He's just like, alright.

3122
02:10:12,200 --> 02:10:13,080
What the fuck?

3123
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:15,560
Okay.

3124
02:10:16,760 --> 02:10:17,240
Alright.

3125
02:10:17,860 --> 02:10:19,120
I can't believe it!

3126
02:10:19,380 --> 02:10:20,960
I am gonna kick a puppy!

3127
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:21,740
Oh!

3128
02:10:21,980 --> 02:10:22,460
Shit!

3129
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:22,980
Okay.

3130
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:24,120
Okay.

3131
02:10:27,780 --> 02:10:28,940
That's fucking right!

3132
02:10:29,140 --> 02:10:29,860
That's right!

3133
02:10:31,340 --> 02:10:32,560
Slap in your head!

3134
02:10:33,340 --> 02:10:35,160
You mean nothing to me!

3135
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:37,760
You mean nothing!

3136
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:41,100
Your existence don't matter!

3137
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:41,660
Oh!

3138
02:10:42,660 --> 02:10:44,000
That's fucking right!

3139
02:10:47,970 --> 02:10:50,100
Will anybody stop her?

3140
02:10:50,220 --> 02:10:51,920
Now she's targeting puppies!

3141
02:10:54,040 --> 02:10:55,580
Oh my god.

3142
02:10:58,100 --> 02:11:00,640
Nothing can compare to the fucking baby.

3143
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:06,860
Nothing can compare to the baby.

3144
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:09,700
Alright.

3145
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:10,780
Now I need to kick a cat.

3146
02:11:14,020 --> 02:11:15,780
I've already hit rock bottom.

3147
02:11:18,140 --> 02:11:19,840
Nothing can stop me now.

3148
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:21,700
Alright.

3149
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:22,260
Let's see.

3150
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:24,260
Enable sprinting while charging.

3151
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:25,860
I feel like I might need that.

3152
02:11:26,180 --> 02:11:28,120
What the fuck is the pillar says?

3153
02:11:28,300 --> 02:11:29,880
Do I have to swap it?

3154
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:32,480
How do I get out of the pillar stance?

3155
02:11:33,160 --> 02:11:33,760
Like...

3156
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:37,600
I don't wanna be in this stance anymore.

3157
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:39,200
Oh my god.

3158
02:11:45,740 --> 02:11:46,640
Let's see.

3159
02:11:47,140 --> 02:11:47,740
Oh!

3160
02:11:47,780 --> 02:11:48,060
Z!

3161
02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:48,960
Okay.

3162
02:11:49,140 --> 02:11:49,720
Z.

3163
02:11:50,700 --> 02:11:51,300
Alright.

3164
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:53,000
Nah, fuck it.

3165
02:11:53,220 --> 02:11:53,980
Actually, no.

3166
02:11:54,140 --> 02:11:55,900
This actually... This stance fucking sucks.

3167
02:11:56,140 --> 02:11:59,220
Gonna grab this.

3168
02:11:59,620 --> 02:12:00,580
And then... Oh!

3169
02:12:00,700 --> 02:12:01,340
What's this?

3170
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:03,380
From one... Okay.

3171
02:12:03,460 --> 02:12:03,620
Yeah.

3172
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:04,540
Actually, we need that.

3173
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:05,660
Okay.

3174
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:06,460
We awakened it.

3175
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:06,780
That's good.

3176
02:12:08,900 --> 02:12:09,380
Okay.

3177
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:10,840
Uh...

3178
02:12:13,300 --> 02:12:14,260
Fucking hell.

3179
02:12:16,340 --> 02:12:17,740
I wanna extend that.

3180
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:20,340
And then... Let's get HP.

3181
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:24,200
I don't have it anymore?

3182
02:12:27,080 --> 02:12:27,900
Oh, there we go.

3183
02:12:28,140 --> 02:12:29,260
Let's get some HP.

3184
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:36,820
Oh...

3185
02:12:37,340 --> 02:12:38,300
Oh my god.

3186
02:12:38,600 --> 02:12:41,000
Everything feels so much easier now.

3187
02:12:44,470 --> 02:12:48,030
And now that I can run while doing this, that's a lot easier.

3188
02:12:49,950 --> 02:12:51,670
Guys, now you know, guys.

3189
02:12:52,710 --> 02:12:54,890
Now you know you can skip the baby.

3190
02:12:55,210 --> 02:12:56,250
You're welcome.

3191
02:12:56,590 --> 02:12:57,990
You're fucking welcome.

3192
02:12:59,190 --> 02:12:59,850
You're fucking welcome.

3193
02:13:01,870 --> 02:13:03,070
You're fucking welcome.

3194
02:13:03,070 --> 02:13:05,570
I figured it out for you guys.

3195
02:13:10,240 --> 02:13:10,860
Alright.

3196
02:13:11,620 --> 02:13:15,020
Someone's like, I already fought the baby though, Toki.

3197
02:13:15,300 --> 02:13:16,420
I already...

3198
02:13:16,420 --> 02:13:18,580
I already fought the baby.

3199
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:23,660
Alright.

3200
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:25,740
Let's see.

3201
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:28,600
I have nothing I wanna buy.

3202
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:32,660
Is there anything I missed in there?

3203
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:35,400
Oh, there it is.

3204
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:39,540
I did it.

3205
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:40,960
I got this...

3206
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:42,020
The Lotus Pill.

3207
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:45,260
But I got in the richest land that...

3208
02:13:45,260 --> 02:13:46,980
Oh, I can increase my maximum HP.

3209
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:47,820
Let's go.

3210
02:13:48,840 --> 02:13:50,780
God, if only I had that earlier.

3211
02:13:58,480 --> 02:14:01,800
It's like if I fucking fought the horse guy in Elden Ring.

3212
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:03,180
This is basically it.

3213
02:14:07,010 --> 02:14:07,650
Alright.

3214
02:14:09,990 --> 02:14:10,630
Like...

3215
02:14:11,630 --> 02:14:14,710
I've already like progressed so much.

3216
02:14:14,830 --> 02:14:16,730
None of these matter anymore.

3217
02:14:17,210 --> 02:14:17,730
What?

3218
02:14:18,330 --> 02:14:19,310
None of these.

3219
02:14:20,770 --> 02:14:22,670
None of them can hurt me.

3220
02:14:24,710 --> 02:14:26,170
You can't hurt me.

3221
02:14:26,750 --> 02:14:28,710
You can't hurt me no more.

3222
02:14:29,030 --> 02:14:30,270
That's fucking right.

3223
02:14:30,330 --> 02:14:30,730
Run!

3224
02:14:30,730 --> 02:14:31,110
RUN!

3225
02:14:32,550 --> 02:14:34,090
I already beat the game.

3226
02:14:36,450 --> 02:14:38,430
I already beat the game.

3227
02:14:39,970 --> 02:14:40,590
Alright.

3228
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:44,350
Get over here.

3229
02:14:46,110 --> 02:14:47,150
Yeah, that's right.

3230
02:14:49,260 --> 02:14:50,170
Do I go this way?

3231
02:14:51,770 --> 02:14:52,390
Oh.

3232
02:14:52,870 --> 02:14:53,810
What are you?

3233
02:14:56,250 --> 02:14:57,450
That's fucking right.

3234
02:14:57,590 --> 02:14:59,030
You don't hurt me anymore.

3235
02:14:59,110 --> 02:14:59,970
You don't scare me.

3236
02:15:00,770 --> 02:15:03,150
All of you guys are weak ass.

3237
02:15:03,370 --> 02:15:04,810
You're like, you're like infants.

3238
02:15:04,990 --> 02:15:06,390
You're like in the womb for me.

3239
02:15:09,170 --> 02:15:10,010
Alright, nice.

3240
02:15:10,070 --> 02:15:10,650
What did I get?

3241
02:15:10,730 --> 02:15:11,190
Yarn.

3242
02:15:11,730 --> 02:15:15,130
You're basically, you're in the womb at this point.

3243
02:15:15,870 --> 02:15:17,570
I fought the real monster.

3244
02:15:20,130 --> 02:15:21,690
Where the fuck do I go?

3245
02:15:24,230 --> 02:15:25,510
Is that Fry?

3246
02:15:26,650 --> 02:15:27,150
Oh.

3247
02:15:27,450 --> 02:15:28,090
Oh god.

3248
02:15:28,730 --> 02:15:29,530
No poison.

3249
02:15:29,950 --> 02:15:30,710
No poison.

3250
02:15:31,350 --> 02:15:32,450
Oh, that's the poison!

3251
02:15:32,750 --> 02:15:33,190
Okay.

3252
02:15:33,970 --> 02:15:36,070
Okay, by exploding, I can die.

3253
02:15:36,190 --> 02:15:36,990
I can get poison.

3254
02:15:39,390 --> 02:15:40,030
There we go.

3255
02:15:40,130 --> 02:15:40,850
And then I dodge.

3256
02:15:41,650 --> 02:15:42,090
Nice.

3257
02:15:42,890 --> 02:15:43,330
Alright.

3258
02:15:44,750 --> 02:15:46,050
I just need to find a cat.

3259
02:15:46,690 --> 02:15:49,050
And I will truly hit rock bottom.

3260
02:15:52,350 --> 02:15:52,790
Alright.

3261
02:15:52,890 --> 02:15:56,110
I just need to punch a cat and then we've done it.

3262
02:15:56,150 --> 02:15:57,390
We've got the trifecta.

3263
02:15:59,750 --> 02:16:00,390
All right.

3264
02:16:00,490 --> 02:16:01,110
Oh, what's this?

3265
02:16:01,810 --> 02:16:02,810
That's a real frog.

3266
02:16:04,210 --> 02:16:06,370
Wait, what separates you and the other frog?

3267
02:16:09,650 --> 02:16:10,050
Nice.

3268
02:16:12,390 --> 02:16:15,830
Oh, I guess that's just the area to get more willpower.

3269
02:16:16,370 --> 02:16:17,450
I guess that was it.

3270
02:16:18,830 --> 02:16:20,130
Oh, we go this way.

3271
02:16:21,650 --> 02:16:23,330
We're still in the prologue, guys.

3272
02:16:23,690 --> 02:16:24,990
We're still in cha...

3273
02:16:24,990 --> 02:16:27,370
Oh my god, I've been here for so long, they sent out...

3274
02:16:27,370 --> 02:16:28,570
Look out the magical wisp.

3275
02:16:28,750 --> 02:16:35,250
The magical fairy that guided me to the actual area that I should be going to.

3276
02:16:38,350 --> 02:16:39,950
It took me too long.

3277
02:16:42,630 --> 02:16:44,110
I mean there's something in this hole?

3278
02:16:44,290 --> 02:16:44,630
No?

3279
02:16:44,730 --> 02:16:45,010
Alright.

3280
02:16:46,650 --> 02:16:47,810
Oh no, it's the crow.

3281
02:16:48,010 --> 02:16:49,350
You don't scare me, crow.

3282
02:16:50,190 --> 02:16:51,330
I've already been...

3283
02:16:51,330 --> 02:16:53,750
Okay, maybe a little bit.

3284
02:16:57,370 --> 02:16:59,250
You might scare me a little bit, never mind.

3285
02:17:02,910 --> 02:17:03,790
Alright, nice.

3286
02:17:04,030 --> 02:17:04,750
We're fine.

3287
02:17:05,430 --> 02:17:06,190
We're fine.

3288
02:17:06,790 --> 02:17:07,510
Everything's fine.

3289
02:17:15,300 --> 02:17:16,000
I'll rest.

3290
02:17:16,300 --> 02:17:17,720
Will the crow come back if I rest?

3291
02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:19,020
Well, time to find out.

3292
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:20,340
Hello?

3293
02:17:20,860 --> 02:17:22,580
Oh no, okay, he's dead forever.

3294
02:17:22,940 --> 02:17:24,360
Oh, that's what I like to see.

3295
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:28,420
Okay, where the fuck do I go?

3296
02:17:28,480 --> 02:17:30,320
There's like so many areas to go.

3297
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:33,560
Alright.

3298
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:38,640
I guess we'll break some jars for some willpower.

3299
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:40,300
Okay.

3300
02:17:44,140 --> 02:17:44,660
Huh?

3301
02:17:47,220 --> 02:17:47,980
Is it...

3302
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:49,960
Is it Sifu?

3303
02:17:52,140 --> 02:17:52,980
Oh my god.

3304
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:53,940
Is it him?

3305
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:55,040
Is it the priest?

3306
02:17:57,160 --> 02:17:58,060
Who is that?

3307
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:01,820
Who are you?

3308
02:18:06,020 --> 02:18:07,580
Have you seen those...

3309
02:18:07,580 --> 02:18:08,360
No, that's not him.

3310
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:10,040
...souls adrift on your path?

3311
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:12,500
He's got the long ears.

3312
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:13,700
...never to fade.

3313
02:18:16,260 --> 02:18:16,580
Shame.

3314
02:18:17,060 --> 02:18:21,020
Your gourd serves little purpose, and mine answers solely to me.

3315
02:18:26,430 --> 02:18:31,910
I know a way to guide the souls, mend their paths, and set them free.

3316
02:18:32,890 --> 02:18:34,370
It will aid you.

3317
02:18:35,130 --> 02:18:35,470
Huh?

3318
02:18:39,030 --> 02:18:40,790
Is he gonna increase my gourd?

3319
02:18:41,470 --> 02:18:42,650
Oh, thank god.

3320
02:18:44,050 --> 02:18:45,450
Where were you earlier?

3321
02:18:46,990 --> 02:18:47,670
Now,

3322
02:18:50,710 --> 02:18:51,990
this is better.

3323
02:18:52,310 --> 02:18:53,510
This gourd.

3324
02:18:54,690 --> 02:19:01,050
Though humble, may save the lost, banish their obsessions, and guide them.

3325
02:19:02,730 --> 02:19:03,330
Yay!

3326
02:19:03,730 --> 02:19:04,910
I have more HP!

3327
02:19:05,010 --> 02:19:06,250
I can get more drunk now!

3328
02:19:06,670 --> 02:19:10,570
Under the guidance of a wise master, the destined one has mastered the art...

3329
02:19:10,570 --> 02:19:11,250
Oh my god.

3330
02:19:11,850 --> 02:19:13,270
Now I can absorb.

3331
02:19:13,570 --> 02:19:17,210
The gourd possesses remarkable divine capabilities.

3332
02:19:18,730 --> 02:19:21,610
Allowing it to absorb the lingering will of spirits.

3333
02:19:25,270 --> 02:19:30,050
For one as destined as you, we are like tumbleweeds.

3334
02:19:30,050 --> 02:19:31,790
Drifting through life.

3335
02:19:32,090 --> 02:19:34,950
We have left them beyond our grasp.

3336
02:19:35,790 --> 02:19:36,390
Alright.

3337
02:19:37,610 --> 02:19:39,250
How do I absorb him?

3338
02:19:39,790 --> 02:19:42,490
Now we can eat the baby's soul.

3339
02:19:43,790 --> 02:19:44,670
Will it be there?

3340
02:19:46,070 --> 02:19:46,790
Did I?

3341
02:19:46,910 --> 02:19:48,570
Oh, thank god!

3342
02:19:49,330 --> 02:19:50,930
Oh, thank god.

3343
02:19:52,430 --> 02:19:53,990
Oh, thank god.

3344
02:19:53,990 --> 02:19:55,490
What do I do with the baby?

3345
02:19:56,430 --> 02:19:57,310
Now what?

3346
02:19:57,830 --> 02:19:59,350
Now I have the baby in me.

3347
02:19:59,350 --> 02:20:00,430
What do I do with it?

3348
02:20:01,490 --> 02:20:02,470
Oh, thank god.

3349
02:20:02,490 --> 02:20:03,810
I don't have to kill him again.

3350
02:20:04,050 --> 02:20:05,330
We ate the baby.

3351
02:20:06,070 --> 02:20:08,690
Master, I got the baby inside me now.

3352
02:20:11,730 --> 02:20:12,690
Baby acquired.

3353
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:14,550
Wait, but what does the baby do?

3354
02:20:15,590 --> 02:20:16,970
I just absorbed him.

3355
02:20:17,110 --> 02:20:17,950
What does he do?

3356
02:20:20,090 --> 02:20:21,710
What the fuck does the baby...

3357
02:20:22,170 --> 02:20:23,730
What does the baby do?

3358
02:20:23,730 --> 02:20:24,770
Like...

3359
02:20:26,570 --> 02:20:27,630
Is it this?

3360
02:20:27,910 --> 02:20:28,150
Oh!

3361
02:20:28,570 --> 02:20:29,250
Okay.

3362
02:20:29,650 --> 02:20:30,230
Okay.

3363
02:20:31,710 --> 02:20:40,050
Take the form of the wandering white bow with bow with almost devotion and ram the foe with your bronze skull.

3364
02:20:40,530 --> 02:20:41,810
Oh shit.

3365
02:20:41,890 --> 02:20:42,510
Wait, what?

3366
02:20:42,790 --> 02:20:44,370
I can be the baby?

3367
02:20:44,690 --> 02:20:46,710
Oh my god!

3368
02:20:49,830 --> 02:20:51,890
Wait, I can be the baby.

3369
02:20:54,910 --> 02:20:55,750
Okay, cultivate.

3370
02:20:58,450 --> 02:20:59,810
Oh my god, it's over.

3371
02:21:00,430 --> 02:21:02,470
It's time to be big baby time.

3372
02:21:03,430 --> 02:21:04,970
It's big baby time.

3373
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:07,290
Okay, but how do I...?

3374
02:21:07,290 --> 02:21:09,170
I already forgot how to do it.

3375
02:21:13,500 --> 02:21:14,520
I already forgot.

3376
02:21:14,820 --> 02:21:16,260
I was like, I can be the baby.

3377
02:21:16,380 --> 02:21:18,400
But then like, how do I become the baby?

3378
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:21,960
How do I become the baby?

3379
02:21:21,960 --> 02:21:22,080
The baby.

3380
02:21:23,440 --> 02:21:27,180
How do I become the baby?

3381
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:29,900
Is it a spell?

3382
02:21:30,220 --> 02:21:30,560
Is it?

3383
02:21:31,260 --> 02:21:32,620
Okay, it said spell.

3384
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:36,200
Nope, that's just... nope.

3385
02:21:48,510 --> 02:21:49,770
Oh, it's F!

3386
02:21:50,070 --> 02:21:51,850
Oh my god, it's F!

3387
02:21:52,070 --> 02:21:54,210
You guys can't see it, I was covering it.

3388
02:21:55,770 --> 02:21:56,590
It's time.

3389
02:21:57,750 --> 02:21:58,130
What the f***?

3390
02:21:58,130 --> 02:21:58,670
Wait, what are you?

3391
02:21:59,370 --> 02:22:00,690
What the f***?!

3392
02:22:00,690 --> 02:22:01,130
No!

3393
02:22:02,430 --> 02:22:03,910
Okay, I was not paying attention.

3394
02:22:04,130 --> 02:22:05,710
I was trying to figure out how to be the baby.

3395
02:22:07,910 --> 02:22:08,910
Oh no, I'm poisoned.

3396
02:22:11,530 --> 02:22:11,930
Wait!

3397
02:22:12,070 --> 02:22:15,070
Oh, it's like re... I can't even use the... okay.

3398
02:22:15,810 --> 02:22:16,210
Alright.

3399
02:22:19,470 --> 02:22:20,370
Okay, here we go.

3400
02:22:21,790 --> 02:22:22,650
That's f***ing right.

3401
02:22:22,970 --> 02:22:23,370
Boom!

3402
02:22:24,950 --> 02:22:25,350
Alright.

3403
02:22:25,970 --> 02:22:27,390
What the f*** was that?

3404
02:22:27,530 --> 02:22:28,250
Is that a dragon?

3405
02:22:28,510 --> 02:22:29,870
Oh, it's a snake patrol there.

3406
02:22:31,330 --> 02:22:31,930
Okay.

3407
02:22:31,930 --> 02:22:33,750
We killed... we killed a snake.

3408
02:22:34,750 --> 02:22:36,290
I'm still poisoned though.

3409
02:22:37,110 --> 02:22:38,130
F*** your horn.

3410
02:22:40,170 --> 02:22:40,890
Where's E?

3411
02:22:44,840 --> 02:22:45,440
Oh!

3412
02:22:45,460 --> 02:22:45,760
Oh!

3413
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:46,240
Not!

3414
02:22:46,380 --> 02:22:46,740
Not!

3415
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:47,180
Oh!

3416
02:22:47,260 --> 02:22:51,080
Not good person!

3417
02:22:51,860 --> 02:22:52,460
Okay.

3418
02:22:54,820 --> 02:22:55,900
That's f***ing right.

3419
02:22:59,080 --> 02:22:59,880
That's right!

3420
02:23:01,300 --> 02:23:02,580
Can't do anything now!

3421
02:23:02,980 --> 02:23:03,940
Oh, s***!

3422
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:05,820
Okay, maybe you can.

3423
02:23:06,080 --> 02:23:06,780
You know what?

3424
02:23:07,260 --> 02:23:08,060
Who cares?

3425
02:23:08,200 --> 02:23:09,160
Oh wait, maybe I do care.

3426
02:23:09,980 --> 02:23:10,500
Alright.

3427
02:23:11,160 --> 02:23:12,520
I'm gonna heal real fast.

3428
02:23:14,240 --> 02:23:15,440
You don't scare me.

3429
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:16,760
Boom!

3430
02:23:16,820 --> 02:23:16,980
Oh!

3431
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:21,560
That was bait.

3432
02:23:24,300 --> 02:23:26,200
You still don't scare me.

3433
02:23:27,500 --> 02:23:31,120
It takes forever to charge the baby meter.

3434
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:32,200
Why?

3435
02:23:34,360 --> 02:23:37,720
I mean, the baby meter is so f***ing low.

3436
02:23:39,380 --> 02:23:39,720
Alright.

3437
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:42,200
I cannot become the baby yet, guys.

3438
02:23:42,420 --> 02:23:47,720
I need to wait 20... I need to wait 9 months to become the baby.

3439
02:23:51,560 --> 02:23:52,240
Oh, s***!

3440
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:53,060
Where do I go?

3441
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:55,800
What?

3442
02:23:58,360 --> 02:23:58,980
What's that?

3443
02:24:01,940 --> 02:24:02,460
Oh.

3444
02:24:02,460 --> 02:24:03,640
You come down here.

3445
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:05,720
Thank you.

3446
02:24:08,700 --> 02:24:10,840
Thank God they came down here.

3447
02:24:11,900 --> 02:24:12,800
Thank God.

3448
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:15,080
I did not want to go down up there.

3449
02:24:16,340 --> 02:24:16,860
Nice.

3450
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:17,420
Alright.

3451
02:24:17,560 --> 02:24:18,400
We got more gold.

3452
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:19,800
Okay.

3453
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:21,620
I guess I'll go this way first.

3454
02:24:22,700 --> 02:24:24,920
So much in this world.

3455
02:24:28,470 --> 02:24:29,070
Okay.

3456
02:24:29,110 --> 02:24:29,430
Nice.

3457
02:24:29,730 --> 02:24:32,510
I can assume those who had...

3458
02:24:32,510 --> 02:24:33,750
Oh my God.

3459
02:24:35,550 --> 02:24:41,250
I hate having... I hate being given free will to decide where to go.

3460
02:24:41,470 --> 02:24:42,570
I don't like that.

3461
02:24:43,670 --> 02:24:45,610
I like to be told where to go.

3462
02:24:46,850 --> 02:24:48,650
I like to look at maps.

3463
02:24:48,850 --> 02:24:49,450
I like to look at maps.

3464
02:24:51,270 --> 02:24:53,530
You give me too much responsibility.

3465
02:24:54,690 --> 02:24:56,790
I don't like responsibility.

3466
02:24:59,790 --> 02:25:00,430
Alright.

3467
02:25:00,690 --> 02:25:01,650
Nice.

3468
02:25:05,830 --> 02:25:07,210
Oh, s***!

3469
02:25:08,490 --> 02:25:09,130
What?

3470
02:25:10,050 --> 02:25:10,870
Oh!

3471
02:25:18,810 --> 02:25:19,770
Okay.

3472
02:25:20,630 --> 02:25:21,650
Okay.

3473
02:25:21,710 --> 02:25:23,470
That's f***ing right.

3474
02:25:23,690 --> 02:25:24,770
Dog!

3475
02:25:25,710 --> 02:25:26,350
Dog!

3476
02:25:26,990 --> 02:25:27,990
Dog!

3477
02:25:28,670 --> 02:25:29,210
Dog!

3478
02:25:29,210 --> 02:25:31,290
Got that dog in me!

3479
02:25:34,570 --> 02:25:35,130
Oh.

3480
02:25:35,270 --> 02:25:35,670
Nice.

3481
02:25:35,970 --> 02:25:36,510
Okay.

3482
02:25:37,610 --> 02:25:38,170
Alright.

3483
02:25:40,070 --> 02:25:42,090
Oh, this song is so sick.

3484
02:25:45,810 --> 02:25:47,750
The song was so sick.

3485
02:25:47,790 --> 02:25:48,490
I got distracted.

3486
02:25:49,930 --> 02:25:51,510
Holy f*** the butt.

3487
02:25:51,870 --> 02:25:54,050
He used his butt to attack me.

3488
02:25:54,110 --> 02:25:54,690
That's f***.

3489
02:25:55,430 --> 02:25:56,410
That's f***ing right.

3490
02:25:57,170 --> 02:25:58,110
Oh, we did it.

3491
02:25:59,290 --> 02:26:00,130
Does he explode?

3492
02:26:00,370 --> 02:26:01,110
Oh, he just...

3493
02:26:01,110 --> 02:26:01,930
Oh my God.

3494
02:26:01,950 --> 02:26:02,970
We'll get a frog in me too.

3495
02:26:04,570 --> 02:26:05,170
That's right.

3496
02:26:05,210 --> 02:26:05,950
I punched a frog.

3497
02:26:12,430 --> 02:26:12,910
Oh.

3498
02:26:13,550 --> 02:26:15,250
I got the frog in me now.

3499
02:26:16,390 --> 02:26:17,650
Somebody stopped her.

3500
02:26:18,090 --> 02:26:19,730
Now she punched a frog?

3501
02:26:23,690 --> 02:26:24,650
Get down.

3502
02:26:26,090 --> 02:26:26,570
Nice.

3503
02:26:27,350 --> 02:26:27,830
Alright.

3504
02:26:28,110 --> 02:26:29,650
Must be like loot here, right?

3505
02:26:29,690 --> 02:26:30,830
After everything I did.

3506
02:26:31,350 --> 02:26:32,730
Or does he just live here?

3507
02:26:33,370 --> 02:26:33,950
Alright.

3508
02:26:34,030 --> 02:26:35,010
That's my home now.

3509
02:26:35,310 --> 02:26:37,450
He's dead so I can legally live here now.

3510
02:26:38,110 --> 02:26:39,630
You need the mark.

3511
02:26:39,670 --> 02:26:41,210
I need the yellow paint.

3512
02:26:44,010 --> 02:26:45,470
Somebody hold a funeral.

3513
02:26:45,690 --> 02:26:46,470
Frogbird's dead.

3514
02:26:47,530 --> 02:26:49,630
Now I have a sword, Frogbird.

3515
02:26:52,430 --> 02:26:53,970
Now he's inside.

3516
02:26:56,070 --> 02:26:56,650
Alright.

3517
02:26:56,770 --> 02:26:57,690
Let's see.

3518
02:26:57,990 --> 02:26:58,430
Oh, here.

3519
02:26:59,950 --> 02:27:00,530
Mushrooms.

3520
02:27:01,070 --> 02:27:02,090
Snakehead mushrooms.

3521
02:27:02,090 --> 02:27:02,490
Mushrooms.

3522
02:27:05,110 --> 02:27:08,970
Honestly, I do feel like a better player ever since.

3523
02:27:11,190 --> 02:27:14,290
I actually do feel like a better player.

3524
02:27:16,890 --> 02:27:23,930
The baby was literally like learning the entire fucking mechanics of this game.

3525
02:27:25,910 --> 02:27:26,630
Alright.

3526
02:27:26,650 --> 02:27:27,010
Nice.

3527
02:27:28,130 --> 02:27:28,850
Yeah.

3528
02:27:28,890 --> 02:27:29,850
I was forced to learn.

3529
02:27:29,850 --> 02:27:32,490
If I didn't fight the baby, I would have never learned.

3530
02:27:34,430 --> 02:27:34,950
Okay.

3531
02:27:37,030 --> 02:27:38,630
Get rid of him first.

3532
02:27:41,890 --> 02:27:42,890
That's fucking right.

3533
02:27:43,410 --> 02:27:44,670
I'm gonna charge it up.

3534
02:27:47,150 --> 02:27:48,430
Oh, what the fuck?

3535
02:27:48,750 --> 02:27:50,330
That wasn't supposed to kill you?

3536
02:27:52,550 --> 02:27:53,250
That's right.

3537
02:27:53,590 --> 02:27:55,810
What you gonna do with that sword, bitch?

3538
02:27:56,530 --> 02:27:57,610
Bro, there's so...

3539
02:27:57,610 --> 02:27:58,270
Oh, fuck.

3540
02:27:58,890 --> 02:27:59,630
It's a dragon.

3541
02:28:00,170 --> 02:28:00,570
Snake.

3542
02:28:01,170 --> 02:28:01,750
Snake dragon.

3543
02:28:03,850 --> 02:28:05,230
Oh, that's not what I wanted to do.

3544
02:28:05,290 --> 02:28:06,810
I just stared at him.

3545
02:28:07,210 --> 02:28:07,610
Whoops.

3546
02:28:09,910 --> 02:28:10,310
Alright.

3547
02:28:10,490 --> 02:28:11,350
You will be dead soon.

3548
02:28:11,490 --> 02:28:11,950
Don't worry.

3549
02:28:13,350 --> 02:28:13,750
Boom.

3550
02:28:14,410 --> 02:28:15,090
There you go.

3551
02:28:17,190 --> 02:28:17,990
Holy shit.

3552
02:28:18,190 --> 02:28:19,890
And I'm still in chapter one.

3553
02:28:21,390 --> 02:28:22,070
Oh, no.

3554
02:28:22,410 --> 02:28:22,930
Oh, no.

3555
02:28:22,950 --> 02:28:23,470
Not the mimic.

3556
02:28:26,990 --> 02:28:27,610
It's fine.

3557
02:28:28,310 --> 02:28:29,890
Okay, that did barely anything.

3558
02:28:30,070 --> 02:28:31,310
That is not fine, actually.

3559
02:28:32,330 --> 02:28:34,550
That is not fine.

3560
02:28:34,570 --> 02:28:35,530
I barely did anything.

3561
02:28:36,930 --> 02:28:37,410
Alright.

3562
02:28:37,910 --> 02:28:40,690
So, I still have, like, another charged attack.

3563
02:28:41,690 --> 02:28:42,750
I'll hit mine first.

3564
02:28:42,890 --> 02:28:43,290
Nice.

3565
02:28:44,430 --> 02:28:44,910
Alright.

3566
02:28:45,330 --> 02:28:46,830
We got the snake head mushroom.

3567
02:28:47,570 --> 02:28:48,510
The funglings.

3568
02:28:48,610 --> 02:28:49,970
Oh, we got the last of us.

3569
02:28:55,430 --> 02:28:56,830
Where the fuck am I?

3570
02:28:57,270 --> 02:28:58,610
How did I get here?

3571
02:28:59,050 --> 02:28:59,950
How did I...

3572
02:28:59,950 --> 02:29:02,010
How did I get in here?

3573
02:29:02,390 --> 02:29:03,230
Where am I?

3574
02:29:04,150 --> 02:29:05,330
I can be baby!

3575
02:29:06,610 --> 02:29:07,310
That's it.

3576
02:29:07,730 --> 02:29:08,250
Come on!

3577
02:29:08,430 --> 02:29:10,050
I took 20!

3578
02:29:11,750 --> 02:29:13,870
I just need you guys to know.

3579
02:29:14,210 --> 02:29:17,470
It took me so long to charge that up.

3580
02:29:17,710 --> 02:29:18,410
And it...

3581
02:29:18,410 --> 02:29:19,910
I didn't even kill him.

3582
02:29:20,310 --> 02:29:20,750
I...

3583
02:29:20,750 --> 02:29:23,610
I didn't even kill him.

3584
02:29:23,690 --> 02:29:23,910
Oh, no.

3585
02:29:23,930 --> 02:29:25,870
Are you fucking kidding me?

3586
02:29:26,930 --> 02:29:27,590
Like...

3587
02:29:28,630 --> 02:29:30,370
That was it?

3588
02:29:31,110 --> 02:29:32,570
That was it?

3589
02:29:33,030 --> 02:29:34,090
Are you fucking?

3590
02:29:37,850 --> 02:29:39,570
Oh, my god.

3591
02:29:39,970 --> 02:29:43,190
I can't believe that is all it did.

3592
02:29:44,210 --> 02:29:45,450
And so.

3593
02:29:45,590 --> 02:29:46,710
Okay, I did a circle.

3594
02:29:49,130 --> 02:29:49,790
Oh.

3595
02:29:50,450 --> 02:29:51,550
Oh, my god.

3596
02:29:51,550 --> 02:29:53,710
It literally, it was just 1 second.

3597
02:29:53,750 --> 02:29:53,910
That is so...

3598
02:29:53,910 --> 02:30:01,510
It took so long to charge and it only lasted a second.

3599
02:30:01,630 --> 02:30:03,270
That's so fucked, man.

3600
02:30:04,830 --> 02:30:06,290
Okay, I'll charge this.

3601
02:30:08,470 --> 02:30:09,150
Boom!

3602
02:30:09,150 --> 02:30:10,130
There you go.

3603
02:30:11,750 --> 02:30:13,670
Oh, the baby cameo.

3604
02:30:13,710 --> 02:30:18,610
Sorry, each baby cameo costs like an akasupa.

3605
02:30:20,950 --> 02:30:22,010
Oh, god.

3606
02:30:24,530 --> 02:30:26,990
And like, I don't have any mana, too.

3607
02:30:29,730 --> 02:30:31,490
It's a very expensive...

3608
02:30:31,490 --> 02:30:35,210
The cameo was very expensive, guys.

3609
02:30:41,470 --> 02:30:42,010
Whoa!

3610
02:30:42,010 --> 02:30:43,570
Oh, I used it all up.

3611
02:30:45,630 --> 02:30:46,850
What the fuck?!

3612
02:30:46,850 --> 02:30:48,410
Okay, that's fucked up.

3613
02:30:51,270 --> 02:30:52,590
Alright, nice.

3614
02:30:53,330 --> 02:30:55,750
Jesus Christ, at least I don't take that much damage.

3615
02:30:58,290 --> 02:30:58,910
Alright.

3616
02:31:02,130 --> 02:31:03,010
I'm lost.

3617
02:31:03,490 --> 02:31:08,150
I feel like I've been going around in circles for like...

3618
02:31:08,150 --> 02:31:09,250
So long.

3619
02:31:09,790 --> 02:31:10,690
This way?

3620
02:31:12,150 --> 02:31:13,430
I'm so lost.

3621
02:31:14,360 --> 02:31:15,690
No, this is where I...

3622
02:31:17,270 --> 02:31:18,270
Where am I?

3623
02:31:19,090 --> 02:31:20,870
Where the fuck am I?

3624
02:31:22,270 --> 02:31:22,870
Where?

3625
02:31:24,850 --> 02:31:27,930
I'm like killing everybody because I don't know where to go.

3626
02:31:28,230 --> 02:31:29,430
I'm like killing everybody because I don't know where to go.

3627
02:31:33,850 --> 02:31:34,450
Okay.

3628
02:31:45,250 --> 02:31:46,110
Do they...

3629
02:31:46,110 --> 02:31:47,170
Do they just keep coming?

3630
02:31:51,190 --> 02:31:52,370
Oh, thank...

3631
02:31:52,370 --> 02:31:53,030
Okay, fire.

3632
02:31:53,830 --> 02:31:54,430
Fire!

3633
02:31:54,430 --> 02:31:55,670
Oh, thank god, fire.

3634
02:31:55,770 --> 02:31:56,390
I found fire.

3635
02:31:57,050 --> 02:31:57,650
Fire.

3636
02:31:57,650 --> 02:31:57,910
Oh, thank god, fire.

3637
02:31:57,910 --> 02:31:57,910
I found fire.

3638
02:31:57,910 --> 02:31:58,190
I know.

3639
02:31:58,410 --> 02:32:00,310
This humble one's name is Grongmo.

3640
02:32:00,990 --> 02:32:06,250
Should my demise come by your hands, please pass this message to my mind.

3641
02:32:06,310 --> 02:32:06,970
Where's my GPS?

3642
02:32:07,370 --> 02:32:10,490
Searching for deity, mortals do aspire.

3643
02:32:12,670 --> 02:32:18,070
Craving immortality, Yaoguai's surely will conspire.

3644
02:32:18,810 --> 02:32:20,050
Wait, am I fighting you?

3645
02:32:20,230 --> 02:32:21,030
Oh, no!

3646
02:32:21,230 --> 02:32:21,750
No!

3647
02:32:21,790 --> 02:32:22,210
Please!

3648
02:32:22,370 --> 02:32:23,210
This is so fun!

3649
02:32:25,190 --> 02:32:26,490
I have nothing!

3650
02:32:26,490 --> 02:32:26,970
Nothing!

3651
02:32:27,890 --> 02:32:30,390
I don't even have the baby!

3652
02:32:36,760 --> 02:32:40,220
Oh god, I don't... I don't know what you do!

3653
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:50,680
Okay, oh he has like poison skills too.

3654
02:32:58,980 --> 02:33:00,680
Okay, that's fucking right.

3655
02:33:00,840 --> 02:33:01,360
Fire!

3656
02:33:02,120 --> 02:33:02,880
Fire!

3657
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:04,100
Fire beats water!

3658
02:33:04,100 --> 02:33:04,400
Fire beats wind!

3659
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:07,600
Guys, I don't think fire beats wind.

3660
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:11,020
But I will make it so!

3661
02:33:13,240 --> 02:33:14,440
Oh god.

3662
02:33:24,210 --> 02:33:25,630
Fire must be wind, right?

3663
02:33:31,750 --> 02:33:32,910
No way!

3664
02:33:34,630 --> 02:33:36,770
I don't even know your moveset!

3665
02:33:36,950 --> 02:33:38,110
There's no way!

3666
02:33:41,450 --> 02:33:42,250
Oh!

3667
02:33:42,250 --> 02:33:42,990
Oh god!

3668
02:33:45,760 --> 02:33:46,780
Oh god!

3669
02:33:47,100 --> 02:33:47,640
Oh!

3670
02:33:50,340 --> 02:33:51,140
No!

3671
02:33:51,140 --> 02:33:52,460
The poison!

3672
02:33:52,460 --> 02:33:56,940
I had zero heals!

3673
02:33:57,140 --> 02:33:58,180
You fucker!

3674
02:33:58,920 --> 02:34:05,260
I had no heals and zero mana!

3675
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:07,680
I couldn't even freeze him!

3676
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:12,380
Oh my god, I left the kill so far!

3677
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:14,580
Okay, we know the pathway though.

3678
02:34:14,660 --> 02:34:15,220
Oh my god, I left the kill so far!

3679
02:34:15,220 --> 02:34:15,220
Okay, we know the pathway though.

3680
02:34:15,220 --> 02:34:15,540
Oh my god, I left the kill so far!

3681
02:34:15,540 --> 02:34:15,540
Okay, we know the pathway though.

3682
02:34:15,540 --> 02:34:16,340
We know the pathway.

3683
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:17,380
It's fine.

3684
02:34:17,820 --> 02:34:20,140
I know how to deal with this fucker.

3685
02:34:20,220 --> 02:34:20,340
We know the pathway.

3686
02:34:20,340 --> 02:34:20,340
It's fine.

3687
02:34:20,340 --> 02:34:20,340
I know how to deal with this fucker.

3688
02:34:24,480 --> 02:34:27,200
Oh my god, why is- Oh my god!

3689
02:34:27,220 --> 02:34:27,880
You fucker.

3690
02:34:29,420 --> 02:34:30,960
You actual fucker.

3691
02:34:35,020 --> 02:34:35,500
Ugh...

3692
02:34:36,320 --> 02:34:38,240
I can't believe I have to run so far.

3693
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:40,040
I can't believe it.

3694
02:34:40,220 --> 02:34:42,180
I already have to use my 1H.

3695
02:34:42,540 --> 02:34:44,380
Oh my god, where am I?

3696
02:34:44,640 --> 02:34:46,600
I actually don't remember how to get there.

3697
02:34:46,860 --> 02:34:48,640
I- I lied.

3698
02:34:48,840 --> 02:34:49,020
I lied.

3699
02:34:50,920 --> 02:34:53,320
How am I still fucking poisoned?

3700
02:35:00,960 --> 02:35:03,540
How do I get unpoisoned?

3701
02:35:04,520 --> 02:35:05,040
What?

3702
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:10,680
Where's fire?

3703
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:15,740
Oh, there it is.

3704
02:35:16,520 --> 02:35:17,620
Alright, fuck it.

3705
02:35:18,420 --> 02:35:19,120
Fuck you.

3706
02:35:22,360 --> 02:35:24,660
I hate him so much.

3707
02:35:26,320 --> 02:35:29,240
I hate him so much.

3708
02:35:30,380 --> 02:35:31,460
Shit.

3709
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:33,500
This actually...

3710
02:35:33,500 --> 02:35:34,300
Fuck.

3711
02:35:36,760 --> 02:35:40,860
I can't believe the baby whiff.

3712
02:35:44,180 --> 02:35:45,860
Oh my god.

3713
02:35:48,080 --> 02:35:50,760
The baby actually whiffed.

3714
02:35:55,120 --> 02:35:56,760
Jesus Christ.

3715
02:35:57,200 --> 02:35:59,060
Goddamn fucking baby.

3716
02:35:59,220 --> 02:35:59,580
Baby, man.

3717
02:36:03,160 --> 02:36:03,820
Okay.

3718
02:36:05,540 --> 02:36:06,420
Oh god.

3719
02:36:07,320 --> 02:36:07,980
Okay.

3720
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:11,760
Okay, nice.

3721
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:14,660
Nice.

3722
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:15,860
Goodbye.

3723
02:36:16,100 --> 02:36:17,820
Oh, get outta here.

3724
02:36:19,740 --> 02:36:21,520
Get outta here.

3725
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:25,940
I don't need to be the shit on you.

3726
02:36:27,360 --> 02:36:29,460
Get in my body.

3727
02:36:30,920 --> 02:36:32,560
Get inside.

3728
02:36:33,960 --> 02:36:36,100
I absorb you now.

3729
02:36:41,940 --> 02:36:44,800
Into the Pokeball you go.

3730
02:36:55,160 --> 02:36:57,360
I'm so mad.

3731
02:36:57,800 --> 02:36:59,200
I'm so mad.

3732
02:36:59,220 --> 02:37:02,940
The payout for his fucking move was not worth it.

3733
02:37:03,080 --> 02:37:03,780
I am...

3734
02:37:05,820 --> 02:37:07,740
I am just so mad.

3735
02:37:07,860 --> 02:37:09,060
It just wasn't worth it.

3736
02:37:09,200 --> 02:37:10,260
Not all...

3737
02:37:10,260 --> 02:37:13,260
Not all of China will know I killed him.

3738
02:37:13,860 --> 02:37:14,480
Let's go.

3739
02:37:24,070 --> 02:37:25,430
I'll never get over it.

3740
02:37:25,650 --> 02:37:27,770
I felt like I lost a part of me there.

3741
02:37:28,050 --> 02:37:29,410
I have an ominous feat.

3742
02:37:31,650 --> 02:37:36,810
After the bell rang it seems as though the resentment in the depths of the mountain is great.

3743
02:37:36,810 --> 02:37:40,230
They were evil fucking gods anyway.

3744
02:37:41,350 --> 02:37:42,790
I did a good thing.

3745
02:37:51,230 --> 02:37:51,790
Alright.

3746
02:37:52,590 --> 02:37:53,530
The fuck?

3747
02:37:53,950 --> 02:37:56,430
Okay, I ran this way.

3748
02:37:56,630 --> 02:37:57,990
Which way did I come from?

3749
02:37:59,110 --> 02:38:00,050
Is it this way?

3750
02:38:00,210 --> 02:38:01,510
Okay, this is the way I have to go.

3751
02:38:03,210 --> 02:38:04,590
Alright, up the mountain.

3752
02:38:06,570 --> 02:38:09,650
Up should be where Oh, nice.

3753
02:38:09,730 --> 02:38:10,650
The incense is here.

3754
02:38:11,350 --> 02:38:11,870
Nice.

3755
02:38:13,530 --> 02:38:14,050
Alright.

3756
02:38:14,050 --> 02:38:15,630
Let's see what the other guys do.

3757
02:38:20,880 --> 02:38:21,400
Alright.

3758
02:38:21,500 --> 02:38:22,580
Do I have new craft armor?

3759
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:23,060
No.

3760
02:38:23,220 --> 02:38:24,300
Okay, the same armor.

3761
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:30,260
I like how I paid to win and the armor literally only lasted me for like one boss.

3762
02:38:30,700 --> 02:38:31,680
Like, I...

3763
02:38:37,700 --> 02:38:40,160
I just don't know anymore.

3764
02:38:40,300 --> 02:38:40,660
I...

3765
02:38:44,280 --> 02:38:48,860
It literally just like lasted me one fucking boss as an alien.

3766
02:38:49,940 --> 02:38:51,200
Alright, let's see.

3767
02:38:51,400 --> 02:38:52,320
Who do I want?

3768
02:38:53,120 --> 02:38:53,800
Okay.

3769
02:38:54,200 --> 02:39:01,320
Sort by... Alright, so takes the form bow with outmost and with your bronze dealing massive damage.

3770
02:39:01,640 --> 02:39:07,840
Through a soft, the snakes will slither away once their venom is depleted.

3771
02:39:09,180 --> 02:39:11,140
Modern increases poison damage.

3772
02:39:11,260 --> 02:39:12,540
Wouldn't poison damage be good?

3773
02:39:15,080 --> 02:39:17,520
How do I change it then?

3774
02:39:24,800 --> 02:39:26,740
It still says F for baby.

3775
02:39:28,560 --> 02:39:30,060
How do I change it?

3776
02:39:30,760 --> 02:39:31,240
What?

3777
02:39:39,650 --> 02:39:43,290
It says cultivate, but I can't change it.

3778
02:39:48,240 --> 02:39:49,480
Alright, what does it look like?

3779
02:39:50,140 --> 02:39:50,620
Equipment?

3780
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:51,140
Is it equipment?

3781
02:39:51,500 --> 02:39:51,960
Okay.

3782
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:54,080
What does this look like?

3783
02:39:56,880 --> 02:39:57,360
Alright.

3784
02:39:57,860 --> 02:39:58,440
You know what?

3785
02:39:58,460 --> 02:39:58,900
Fuck it.

3786
02:39:58,920 --> 02:39:59,940
We'll cultivate the baby.

3787
02:40:00,220 --> 02:40:01,640
What's the worst that could happen?

3788
02:40:02,520 --> 02:40:03,520
Alright, let's see.

3789
02:40:04,060 --> 02:40:04,980
Do I need to rest?

3790
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:08,100
Not really.

3791
02:40:08,740 --> 02:40:10,000
I wanna... Ah, fuck it.

3792
02:40:10,020 --> 02:40:10,400
Let's do it.

3793
02:40:11,140 --> 02:40:12,000
Let's rest up.

3794
02:40:16,200 --> 02:40:17,520
Alright, let's see.

3795
02:40:19,040 --> 02:40:19,500
Equipment.

3796
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:20,540
Oh, it is!

3797
02:40:21,020 --> 02:40:21,680
Oh, nice.

3798
02:40:21,720 --> 02:40:22,640
And we get the jade necklace.

3799
02:40:23,540 --> 02:40:25,540
Okay, so that's how you change it.

3800
02:40:25,820 --> 02:40:29,900
When she is full, press F to launch spirit, transforming into a powerful...

3801
02:40:29,900 --> 02:40:30,100
Alright.

3802
02:40:30,680 --> 02:40:31,160
Okay.

3803
02:40:31,640 --> 02:40:32,740
That's how you do it.

3804
02:40:32,920 --> 02:40:34,400
Alright, we'll keep the baby for now.

3805
02:40:35,940 --> 02:40:37,900
Alright, how many... I have three.

3806
02:40:38,360 --> 02:40:41,720
I do... I think I like smash dance a lot more.

3807
02:40:46,860 --> 02:40:48,640
Allows the destined one to execute...

3808
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:51,160
The destined one can see through the incoming nullify.

3809
02:40:51,320 --> 02:40:53,480
Enemies I've been seeing through are easier to stagger.

3810
02:40:55,980 --> 02:40:57,180
Alright, we'll try that.

3811
02:40:57,580 --> 02:40:58,540
Can't be that bad.

3812
02:41:02,350 --> 02:41:02,830
Alright.

3813
02:41:02,970 --> 02:41:04,510
I like to increase my damage.

3814
02:41:05,850 --> 02:41:06,890
And then...

3815
02:41:09,170 --> 02:41:11,510
Alright, I like to increase that too.

3816
02:41:12,170 --> 02:41:12,690
Alright.

3817
02:41:13,530 --> 02:41:14,830
I don't know what I'm doing.

3818
02:41:17,290 --> 02:41:17,810
Alright.

3819
02:41:20,890 --> 02:41:23,190
I do not know what I'm doing.

3820
02:41:23,990 --> 02:41:25,850
I hope I'm doing the right thing.

3821
02:41:28,690 --> 02:41:29,470
Let's see.

3822
02:41:29,670 --> 02:41:31,370
Truly a gamer.

3823
02:41:34,530 --> 02:41:35,010
Oh!

3824
02:41:36,510 --> 02:41:37,550
Why are you crying?

3825
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:44,660
Don't worry.

3826
02:41:44,780 --> 02:41:45,240
Give me a sec.

3827
02:41:45,400 --> 02:41:45,960
Give me a sec.

3828
02:41:46,580 --> 02:41:47,060
Boom!

3829
02:41:48,720 --> 02:41:49,860
I'll help your brother soon.

3830
02:41:50,260 --> 02:41:52,380
I gotta deal with this snake guy.

3831
02:41:52,940 --> 02:41:53,420
Boom!

3832
02:41:53,720 --> 02:41:53,980
Alright.

3833
02:41:56,060 --> 02:41:56,880
Oh, is that it?

3834
02:41:57,280 --> 02:41:57,760
Oh!

3835
02:41:58,740 --> 02:41:59,220
Monkey!

3836
02:42:00,560 --> 02:42:01,740
I didn't even see you.

3837
02:42:11,620 --> 02:42:12,140
Oh!

3838
02:42:12,360 --> 02:42:12,880
Oh!

3839
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:14,780
He's gonna invite me to his home!

3840
02:42:16,260 --> 02:42:17,760
But like, I wanna loot first.

3841
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:19,000
Alright.

3842
02:42:20,820 --> 02:42:21,700
Hello, monkey!

3843
02:42:23,140 --> 02:42:24,540
Got more gold and yarn.

3844
02:42:25,180 --> 02:42:25,700
Nice.

3845
02:42:27,140 --> 02:42:27,880
Alright, monkey.

3846
02:42:28,540 --> 02:42:30,200
Why do you want me to go to your house?

3847
02:42:31,980 --> 02:42:32,500
Whoa!

3848
02:42:32,600 --> 02:42:33,040
Yoink!

3849
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:33,800
That's mine now!

3850
02:42:34,980 --> 02:42:37,240
I love the, like, design.

3851
02:42:37,560 --> 02:42:38,860
Everything looks so amazing.

3852
02:42:39,020 --> 02:42:42,160
Like, I love the environments that they built.

3853
02:42:42,820 --> 02:42:44,420
Hello, what do you have to offer?

3854
02:42:46,860 --> 02:42:47,780
Same monkey!

3855
02:42:55,900 --> 02:42:58,740
There's more of us?

3856
02:42:59,360 --> 02:42:59,960
Oh!

3857
02:42:59,960 --> 02:43:03,280
You all ought to call me forefather.

3858
02:43:04,360 --> 02:43:09,200
But I'm just an old monkey, banished to the mortal world.

3859
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:10,640
Wait!

3860
02:43:12,420 --> 02:43:13,440
Drunk monkey!

3861
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:17,960
Why is he British?

3862
02:43:18,220 --> 02:43:20,980
Cause he's here to fucking drink, that's why.

3863
02:43:21,680 --> 02:43:27,580
Of course the monkey that's selling alcohol is British.

3864
02:43:27,900 --> 02:43:28,280
Oh.

3865
02:43:30,780 --> 02:43:32,460
Alright, each sip restores.

3866
02:43:32,660 --> 02:43:32,960
Ooh.

3867
02:43:34,060 --> 02:43:35,460
Okay, that's- I have coconut.

3868
02:43:36,380 --> 02:43:36,860
What?

3869
02:43:36,860 --> 02:43:39,040
Using the gourd morally...

3870
02:43:39,600 --> 02:43:40,400
Is that it?

3871
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:46,060
Okay, so I have poison resistance now.

3872
02:43:48,560 --> 02:43:49,040
Alright.

3873
02:43:49,160 --> 02:43:50,340
Okay, upgrade drinks.

3874
02:43:52,400 --> 02:43:54,480
I don't have a wine worm.

3875
02:43:54,760 --> 02:43:56,280
Okay, I need to get a wine worm.

3876
02:43:56,660 --> 02:43:57,560
Upgrade gourds.

3877
02:43:59,000 --> 02:43:59,480
Oh!

3878
02:43:59,540 --> 02:44:01,300
Increase- Oh, I get five uses now!

3879
02:44:01,620 --> 02:44:01,820
Nice.

3880
02:44:11,460 --> 02:44:13,980
Maybe he's from Hong Kong.

3881
02:44:16,200 --> 02:44:18,480
He's the Hong Kong monkey.

3882
02:44:22,180 --> 02:44:23,500
Okay, that's good.

3883
02:44:26,720 --> 02:44:28,240
Alright, let's go.

3884
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:33,480
What?

3885
02:44:34,200 --> 02:44:35,260
Okay, this way.

3886
02:44:36,300 --> 02:44:37,560
God damn it!

3887
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:39,240
Why do you give me more than one path?

3888
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:40,780
I hate choices!

3889
02:44:44,360 --> 02:44:44,880
Okay.

3890
02:44:44,880 --> 02:44:45,900
Oh, that's it?

3891
02:44:46,100 --> 02:44:46,940
That's literally it?

3892
02:44:48,540 --> 02:44:49,380
That's- Okay.

3893
02:44:49,720 --> 02:44:50,240
Alright.

3894
02:44:51,060 --> 02:44:52,240
Just for a mushroom.

3895
02:44:53,580 --> 02:44:55,540
Just for a fucking mushroom, I guess.

3896
02:44:58,760 --> 02:44:59,660
Anything here?

3897
02:45:01,360 --> 02:45:03,500
And make sure I'm not missing anything, too.

3898
02:45:06,440 --> 02:45:06,880
Oh.

3899
02:45:06,880 --> 02:45:07,820
I don't like that.

3900
02:45:08,180 --> 02:45:09,680
That usually means there's enemy.

3901
02:45:09,800 --> 02:45:11,020
Why is there such an open area?

3902
02:45:11,660 --> 02:45:13,320
That means I have to fight somebody.

3903
02:45:13,740 --> 02:45:14,960
I fucking knew it.

3904
02:45:15,100 --> 02:45:16,180
I was like, there's no way!

3905
02:45:16,300 --> 02:45:17,400
Why is it so open?

3906
02:45:21,800 --> 02:45:23,540
What happens to the potato man?

3907
02:45:23,540 --> 02:45:26,540
Past grip beyond our grasp.

3908
02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:29,660
The future we may still clasp.

3909
02:45:31,460 --> 02:45:32,300
Oh!

3910
02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:34,220
Where are you?

3911
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:36,660
Oh, no!

3912
02:45:38,780 --> 02:45:41,700
Late is the hour, young one.

3913
02:45:42,580 --> 02:45:46,560
In which you choose to stay in my tranquil abode.

3914
02:45:47,200 --> 02:45:48,120
Pray tell.

3915
02:45:48,680 --> 02:45:50,700
To what end do you seek?

3916
02:45:50,700 --> 02:45:50,900
Guys.

3917
02:45:51,420 --> 02:45:53,260
His pull's longer than my pull.

3918
02:45:54,400 --> 02:45:55,460
That's fucking right.

3919
02:45:55,760 --> 02:45:56,580
Baby time!

3920
02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:00,120
And then!

3921
02:46:01,080 --> 02:46:01,880
Wealth time!

3922
02:46:02,480 --> 02:46:03,560
That's fucking right!

3923
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,280
I'm gonna use as many abilities as I can!

3924
02:46:06,680 --> 02:46:07,200
Boom!

3925
02:46:09,260 --> 02:46:09,800
Ow.

3926
02:46:09,800 --> 02:46:10,640
Oh my god.

3927
02:46:10,660 --> 02:46:12,140
He takes- He does so much.

3928
02:46:14,760 --> 02:46:16,400
Like, what the fuck?

3929
02:46:16,520 --> 02:46:17,420
Oh shit!

3930
02:46:17,660 --> 02:46:18,000
Okay.

3931
02:46:18,200 --> 02:46:19,500
Oh my god!

3932
02:46:20,760 --> 02:46:24,800
What the fuck are his- What are his- What are his combos?

3933
02:46:26,060 --> 02:46:27,340
Oh my

3934
02:46:30,530 --> 02:46:35,230
god!

3935
02:46:35,510 --> 02:46:36,990
It just doesn't stop!

3936
02:46:38,830 --> 02:46:39,470
Boom!

3937
02:46:42,050 --> 02:46:42,690
Boom!

3938
02:46:42,730 --> 02:46:43,350
Oh shit!

3939
02:46:45,210 --> 02:46:45,850
Fuck!

3940
02:46:46,410 --> 02:46:46,670
Okay.

3941
02:46:47,770 --> 02:46:49,230
I don't know his combos.

3942
02:46:53,110 --> 02:46:53,870
Oh god.

3943
02:46:53,890 --> 02:46:55,550
Oh please!

3944
02:46:57,070 --> 02:46:58,770
Please have mercy!

3945
02:46:59,930 --> 02:47:04,210
Please have mercy!

3946
02:47:04,210 --> 02:47:04,370
Please have mercy!

3947
02:47:04,850 --> 02:47:05,490
Oh god.

3948
02:47:05,610 --> 02:47:05,710
Oh god.

3949
02:47:08,450 --> 02:47:10,790
Oh Jesus Christ!

3950
02:47:11,350 --> 02:47:11,850
Oh Jesus Christ!

3951
02:47:11,850 --> 02:47:12,910
What the fuck!

3952
02:47:19,030 --> 02:47:21,410
I couldn't even dodge that!

3953
02:47:21,550 --> 02:47:24,230
If you get hit once, you can't even leave!

3954
02:47:24,230 --> 02:47:26,610
Oh my god!

3955
02:47:27,190 --> 02:47:28,270
What is that?

3956
02:47:28,310 --> 02:47:29,530
What are those combos?

3957
02:47:30,090 --> 02:47:32,130
I couldn't even get away!

3958
02:47:32,850 --> 02:47:33,990
Oh my.

3959
02:47:35,490 --> 02:47:37,110
Which way is the right way?

3960
02:47:37,150 --> 02:47:38,730
I already forgot!

3961
02:47:41,370 --> 02:47:43,410
Where did I come- This way.

3962
02:47:43,550 --> 02:47:43,770
Okay.

3963
02:47:44,530 --> 02:47:45,130
Alright.

3964
02:47:46,450 --> 02:47:47,050
Down.

3965
02:47:47,390 --> 02:47:47,630
Yeah.

3966
02:47:47,710 --> 02:47:48,230
Down.

3967
02:47:48,350 --> 02:47:48,710
Okay.

3968
02:47:49,250 --> 02:47:51,430
Alright, it's all the way down here.

3969
02:47:52,810 --> 02:47:53,930
Holy fuck.

3970
02:47:54,010 --> 02:47:55,650
Okay, I figured out how to use the baby.

3971
02:47:56,190 --> 02:47:56,750
Alright.

3972
02:47:57,950 --> 02:47:59,490
It's just looking at me.

3973
02:48:00,010 --> 02:48:00,570
Menacingly.

3974
02:48:01,570 --> 02:48:03,990
Holy shit, his combos are insane!

3975
02:48:05,250 --> 02:48:05,810
Oh.

3976
02:48:08,390 --> 02:48:09,330
That's fucking right.

3977
02:48:09,410 --> 02:48:10,030
Baby time!

3978
02:48:10,430 --> 02:48:10,830
Bam!

3979
02:48:11,270 --> 02:48:12,190
Did I hit it?

3980
02:48:12,450 --> 02:48:13,410
Oh, thank god.

3981
02:48:14,230 --> 02:48:14,790
Oh!

3982
02:48:19,900 --> 02:48:22,060
Holy fucking hell, man.

3983
02:48:24,800 --> 02:48:25,780
Alright, nice.

3984
02:48:26,480 --> 02:48:27,680
Oh, not nice.

3985
02:48:28,180 --> 02:48:29,300
Oh, god.

3986
02:48:33,840 --> 02:48:34,480
Boom!

3987
02:48:34,580 --> 02:48:34,940
Okay.

3988
02:48:36,600 --> 02:48:38,280
Okay, I can still use my combo.

3989
02:48:38,580 --> 02:48:39,720
Oh, shit!

3990
02:48:39,820 --> 02:48:40,240
Nevermind!

3991
02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:43,600
Nevermind!

3992
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:47,640
Oh, god!

3993
02:48:47,640 --> 02:48:48,020
I go first!

3994
02:48:48,400 --> 02:48:49,180
Oh, god!

3995
02:48:49,260 --> 02:48:49,640
Nice!

3996
02:48:49,880 --> 02:48:50,320
Oh!

3997
02:48:53,880 --> 02:48:54,400
Okay.

3998
02:48:54,400 --> 02:48:55,220
That's fucking right.

3999
02:48:55,280 --> 02:48:55,880
I move first!

4000
02:48:57,060 --> 02:48:57,580
Move!

4001
02:48:59,300 --> 02:48:59,820
Move!

4002
02:48:59,820 --> 02:49:00,340
Move!

4003
02:49:01,800 --> 02:49:02,720
That's fucking right!

4004
02:49:03,100 --> 02:49:04,240
You're not the baby!

4005
02:49:05,220 --> 02:49:06,380
You're not a baby!

4006
02:49:13,640 --> 02:49:14,200
Oh!

4007
02:49:19,980 --> 02:49:21,240
So fucking easy.

4008
02:49:25,140 --> 02:49:26,100
Wait, phase two?

4009
02:49:26,360 --> 02:49:27,180
Wait a minute!

4010
02:49:27,320 --> 02:49:28,940
Wait a minute!

4011
02:49:29,280 --> 02:49:31,420
There was never a phase two!

4012
02:49:31,720 --> 02:49:33,960
Wait a minute!

4013
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:37,080
What do you mean there's a phase two?

4014
02:49:37,940 --> 02:49:39,860
What do you fucking mean?

4015
02:49:43,300 --> 02:49:44,080
Oh, god.

4016
02:49:44,660 --> 02:49:45,440
Oh, god.

4017
02:49:48,600 --> 02:49:49,080
Okay.

4018
02:49:49,140 --> 02:49:49,500
Okay.

4019
02:49:49,720 --> 02:49:50,700
Oh, shit!

4020
02:49:50,780 --> 02:49:51,000
Alright.

4021
02:49:51,660 --> 02:49:52,520
This is fucked.

4022
02:49:54,980 --> 02:49:55,800
This is fucked.

4023
02:49:56,860 --> 02:49:58,300
This is so fucked!

4024
02:49:58,580 --> 02:50:01,000
This is so fucked!

4025
02:50:01,240 --> 02:50:01,640
Bro!

4026
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:05,760
Okay.

4027
02:50:10,380 --> 02:50:11,160
Oh, my god.

4028
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:12,060
Why is there a phase two?

4029
02:50:13,060 --> 02:50:13,540
Oh!

4030
02:50:13,980 --> 02:50:14,460
Bro!

4031
02:50:16,720 --> 02:50:18,480
I can't sum it up!

4032
02:50:18,500 --> 02:50:18,920
Baby!

4033
02:50:21,060 --> 02:50:21,500
Okay.

4034
02:50:22,500 --> 02:50:22,940
Alright.

4035
02:50:24,220 --> 02:50:24,960
Oh, shit!

4036
02:50:26,060 --> 02:50:26,680
That's fine.

4037
02:50:29,280 --> 02:50:29,900
Heavy attack!

4038
02:50:30,160 --> 02:50:30,600
Boom!

4039
02:50:32,680 --> 02:50:34,260
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna be phase two.

4040
02:50:34,320 --> 02:50:36,120
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna be phase two.

4041
02:50:36,240 --> 02:50:36,540
I...

4042
02:50:40,520 --> 02:50:41,400
Holy shit!

4043
02:50:42,040 --> 02:50:43,260
What is that move?

4044
02:50:47,240 --> 02:50:47,720
Oh!

4045
02:50:47,780 --> 02:50:47,920
Oh, god.

4046
02:50:47,960 --> 02:50:48,100
Okay.

4047
02:50:48,620 --> 02:50:49,100
Alright.

4048
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:50,220
We're fine.

4049
02:50:50,620 --> 02:50:51,760
No, we're not fine!

4050
02:50:51,980 --> 02:50:53,000
I don't feel okay!

4051
02:50:54,640 --> 02:50:55,620
What is he doing?

4052
02:50:57,060 --> 02:50:58,620
What is he doing?

4053
02:51:06,590 --> 02:51:08,070
Oh, my god.

4054
02:51:09,870 --> 02:51:10,350
Okay.

4055
02:51:10,810 --> 02:51:12,330
Okay, I figured it out, guys.

4056
02:51:12,950 --> 02:51:15,670
Alright, now that I know he has a phase two...

4057
02:51:16,260 --> 02:51:17,530
I'll be less cocky.

4058
02:51:19,190 --> 02:51:20,270
Less cocky.

4059
02:51:21,070 --> 02:51:22,270
Wait, he can heal?

4060
02:51:24,410 --> 02:51:26,270
That's not very Souls-like of you.

4061
02:51:29,750 --> 02:51:31,250
That's absolutely fucked.

4062
02:51:32,310 --> 02:51:34,130
Wait, you have legs again?

4063
02:51:35,330 --> 02:51:37,070
How did you get your legs back?

4064
02:51:40,750 --> 02:51:42,310
How did you get your legs back?

4065
02:51:42,310 --> 02:51:43,150
Legs back, sir!

4066
02:51:47,320 --> 02:51:47,900
Alright.

4067
02:51:47,980 --> 02:51:48,380
Oh,

4068
02:51:52,800 --> 02:51:53,040
shit!

4069
02:51:53,260 --> 02:51:55,140
Oh, shit!

4070
02:51:55,380 --> 02:51:58,180
Oh, shit!

4071
02:51:58,520 --> 02:51:58,980
Okay.

4072
02:51:59,980 --> 02:52:00,560
Okay.

4073
02:52:00,820 --> 02:52:01,660
Fire time.

4074
02:52:01,740 --> 02:52:02,140
Fire!

4075
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:03,080
Fire!

4076
02:52:04,140 --> 02:52:04,720
Fire!

4077
02:52:06,160 --> 02:52:06,740
And...

4078
02:52:07,880 --> 02:52:08,460
Fire!

4079
02:52:09,040 --> 02:52:09,960
Oh, shit.

4080
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:10,460
I missed that.

4081
02:52:10,540 --> 02:52:10,720
Alright.

4082
02:52:13,300 --> 02:52:13,880
Okay.

4083
02:52:14,800 --> 02:52:15,500
He's fine.

4084
02:52:15,560 --> 02:52:15,880
We're fine.

4085
02:52:15,940 --> 02:52:16,260
We're fine.

4086
02:52:16,300 --> 02:52:16,980
We're so fine.

4087
02:52:17,700 --> 02:52:18,240
Boom!

4088
02:52:21,440 --> 02:52:21,980
Okay.

4089
02:52:22,180 --> 02:52:23,220
We gotta dodge now.

4090
02:52:26,240 --> 02:52:26,780
Alright.

4091
02:52:29,460 --> 02:52:33,380
He distracted me!

4092
02:52:33,900 --> 02:52:36,340
He distracted me with the pretty pole dancing!

4093
02:52:39,540 --> 02:52:41,980
He started pole dancing and I got confused!

4094
02:52:46,580 --> 02:52:47,220
Holy shit.

4095
02:52:48,220 --> 02:52:49,020
Here we go.

4096
02:52:51,840 --> 02:52:52,360
See?

4097
02:52:52,580 --> 02:52:54,160
He was pole dancing everywhere!

4098
02:52:54,660 --> 02:52:55,440
I got confused!

4099
02:52:58,680 --> 02:53:00,040
Oh, my god.

4100
02:53:00,060 --> 02:53:01,260
You can't skip it!

4101
02:53:01,420 --> 02:53:03,940
I have to watch him turn into a snake every time!

4102
02:53:10,160 --> 02:53:13,000
I mean, you already showed it to me.

4103
02:53:13,340 --> 02:53:14,440
It's not different.

4104
02:53:16,020 --> 02:53:17,620
I already saw it already.

4105
02:53:17,740 --> 02:53:18,080
I already saw it already.

4106
02:53:20,200 --> 02:53:20,800
Here.

4107
02:53:20,980 --> 02:53:22,020
Oh, shit!

4108
02:53:25,180 --> 02:53:25,480
Okay.

4109
02:53:26,660 --> 02:53:27,260
Okay.

4110
02:53:27,380 --> 02:53:27,980
Alright.

4111
02:53:30,580 --> 02:53:31,180
Boom!

4112
02:53:31,340 --> 02:53:31,800
There we go.

4113
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:35,320
Okay.

4114
02:53:35,400 --> 02:53:35,680
No!

4115
02:53:38,540 --> 02:53:39,140
Okay.

4116
02:53:39,260 --> 02:53:39,560
No!

4117
02:53:39,680 --> 02:53:40,160
What?!

4118
02:53:40,160 --> 02:53:40,480
Okay.

4119
02:53:43,540 --> 02:53:44,420
Oh, shit!

4120
02:53:47,420 --> 02:53:48,020
Okay.

4121
02:53:48,160 --> 02:53:48,460
Okay.

4122
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:49,460
Oh, god.

4123
02:53:49,560 --> 02:53:50,040
Oh, god.

4124
02:53:52,520 --> 02:53:53,040
Alright.

4125
02:53:53,120 --> 02:53:53,660
We dodged that.

4126
02:53:54,520 --> 02:53:56,380
This music is so intense!

4127
02:53:57,160 --> 02:53:57,680
No!

4128
02:53:57,980 --> 02:53:58,500
Alright.

4129
02:54:00,300 --> 02:54:00,820
Boom!

4130
02:54:02,180 --> 02:54:03,080
That's fucking right!

4131
02:54:04,920 --> 02:54:05,900
That's fucking right!

4132
02:54:09,200 --> 02:54:09,720
Alright.

4133
02:54:11,800 --> 02:54:12,320
Oh!

4134
02:54:12,960 --> 02:54:14,960
Oh, I got hit by that?!

4135
02:54:16,440 --> 02:54:16,960
Alright.

4136
02:54:20,560 --> 02:54:21,160
No!

4137
02:54:22,220 --> 02:54:22,820
Here.

4138
02:54:23,960 --> 02:54:26,140
I need to figure out his combo!

4139
02:54:27,060 --> 02:54:27,660
Okay.

4140
02:54:28,040 --> 02:54:28,640
Woo!

4141
02:54:31,880 --> 02:54:32,480
No!

4142
02:54:35,440 --> 02:54:36,040
Okay.

4143
02:54:38,800 --> 02:54:40,280
I need to fucking make sure.

4144
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:41,600
Alright.

4145
02:54:41,660 --> 02:54:41,940
Dodge!

4146
02:54:45,620 --> 02:54:46,680
Oh, shit!

4147
02:54:46,720 --> 02:54:46,920
No!

4148
02:54:49,180 --> 02:54:49,780
Woo.

4149
02:54:50,760 --> 02:54:51,740
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

4150
02:54:55,640 --> 02:54:56,520
No, fuck!

4151
02:54:56,600 --> 02:54:57,660
Okay, I fucked up there.

4152
02:55:00,240 --> 02:55:02,960
I don't think guys, I don't know if I'm gonna beat this.

4153
02:55:03,040 --> 02:55:03,120
No!

4154
02:55:04,200 --> 02:55:04,640
Yes!

4155
02:55:05,600 --> 02:55:06,740
We did it!

4156
02:55:11,070 --> 02:55:12,570
Please not a phase 3.

4157
02:55:12,970 --> 02:55:14,530
Please not a phase 3.

4158
02:55:15,470 --> 02:55:17,970
But you got your, you got your legs again.

4159
02:55:23,190 --> 02:55:25,730
I defeated you, now you have to be loyal to me.

4160
02:55:29,550 --> 02:55:30,870
Let me absorb you.

4161
02:55:31,370 --> 02:55:34,230
I will never use you more than baby, but like, let me absorb you.

4162
02:55:46,690 --> 02:55:48,250
Wait, you're not supposed to disappear.

4163
02:55:49,210 --> 02:55:51,190
How else will I absorb you inside me?

4164
02:55:54,810 --> 02:55:55,210
What?

4165
02:55:56,570 --> 02:55:58,350
Have you seen them all?

4166
02:55:58,790 --> 02:55:59,310
What?

4167
02:56:00,070 --> 02:56:00,410
No!

4168
02:56:01,030 --> 02:56:05,910
Do you too desire that which they ceaselessly, oh dear...

4169
02:56:05,910 --> 02:56:07,690
The bells?

4170
02:56:09,210 --> 02:56:09,970
The bells?

4171
02:56:10,150 --> 02:56:16,330
Some bells were set in the mountains since the Black-Wind Guia's return, yet no one is allowed to near the wings.

4172
02:56:17,250 --> 02:56:17,930
Oh?

4173
02:56:18,170 --> 02:56:21,770
Maybe the bells have something to do with

4174
02:56:32,570 --> 02:56:35,150
Well, but what about the other bells I rang?

4175
02:56:36,470 --> 02:56:38,650
But I rang all the other bells too.

4176
02:56:38,870 --> 02:56:40,930
I assume I have to go this way?

4177
02:56:41,290 --> 02:56:43,070
I don't like there's no incense.

4178
02:56:43,390 --> 02:56:44,470
Okay, there's the cave.

4179
02:56:45,490 --> 02:56:46,050
Alright.

4180
02:56:47,290 --> 02:56:51,010
Oh, I'm like barely holding on right now.

4181
02:56:56,880 --> 02:56:58,200
Okay, more willpower.

4182
02:56:59,880 --> 02:57:00,400
Oh!

4183
02:57:02,400 --> 02:57:03,720
There's no monster.

4184
02:57:04,580 --> 02:57:06,360
There's no peek-a-boo monster.

4185
02:57:12,200 --> 02:57:14,120
Oh, there he is.

4186
02:57:17,420 --> 02:57:18,740
There he is.

4187
02:57:19,320 --> 02:57:20,920
Wait, then where does this go?

4188
02:57:22,480 --> 02:57:24,280
At least it's not peek-a-boo, okay?

4189
02:57:25,380 --> 02:57:30,040
He was there to show me that he's like, I'm here.

4190
02:57:31,900 --> 02:57:32,860
Maybe this way?

4191
02:57:34,240 --> 02:57:37,040
There has to be like extra stuff somewhere.

4192
02:57:39,700 --> 02:57:41,020
What is over here then?

4193
02:57:45,260 --> 02:57:45,760
Oh?

4194
02:57:47,660 --> 02:57:49,160
Romero, thank you for the super chat.

4195
02:57:49,220 --> 02:57:50,020
Thank you, thank you.

4196
02:57:50,120 --> 02:57:50,440
Oh.

4197
02:57:52,520 --> 02:57:53,440
What is here?

4198
02:57:53,560 --> 02:57:53,940
Oh.

4199
02:57:55,420 --> 02:57:55,920
Oh.

4200
02:57:56,320 --> 02:57:57,280
This is not fair.

4201
02:57:58,700 --> 02:57:59,580
Both time.

4202
02:58:01,020 --> 02:58:01,520
Boom.

4203
02:58:01,660 --> 02:58:02,160
Boom.

4204
02:58:03,220 --> 02:58:04,920
Look, I am nearly one HP.

4205
02:58:05,020 --> 02:58:06,580
I need to pick what I can get.

4206
02:58:07,480 --> 02:58:08,960
But happy birthday, Romero.

4207
02:58:09,400 --> 02:58:10,420
Oh, there it is.

4208
02:58:10,780 --> 02:58:12,520
Happy birthday to you.

4209
02:58:12,980 --> 02:58:14,740
Happy birthday to you.

4210
02:58:14,920 --> 02:58:16,760
Happy birthday, dear Romero.

4211
02:58:16,940 --> 02:58:18,300
Happy birthday to you.

4212
02:58:18,380 --> 02:58:18,660
Yeah!

4213
02:58:20,880 --> 02:58:22,780
I don't think this is what you want to see on your birthday.

4214
02:58:26,720 --> 02:58:30,420
It's got a little bit dark seeing happy birthday while that was hanging in the background.

4215
02:58:30,420 --> 02:58:31,920
The three bears!

4216
02:58:38,280 --> 02:58:39,280
I did it!

4217
02:58:46,320 --> 02:58:47,580
What's going to happen now?

4218
02:58:51,920 --> 02:58:52,560
Obsession.

4219
02:58:52,640 --> 02:58:58,700
A remnant of worldly ties transforms the unfinished aspiration into spaces both tangible and ethereal.

4220
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:00,980
Real and illusionary.

4221
02:59:01,220 --> 02:59:05,640
Through certain objects, one can navigate these spaces, engaging with the past and future.

4222
02:59:07,340 --> 02:59:07,980
Okay.

4223
02:59:13,810 --> 02:59:14,890
Okay, I'm back here.

4224
02:59:17,350 --> 02:59:18,510
What about the cave?

4225
02:59:19,750 --> 02:59:20,530
Wait, what?

4226
02:59:23,030 --> 02:59:23,550
Wait!

4227
02:59:23,950 --> 02:59:24,990
What about the cave?

4228
02:59:25,330 --> 02:59:26,890
I didn't go in the cave!

4229
02:59:27,610 --> 02:59:27,970
I...

4230
02:59:28,690 --> 02:59:33,590
I didn't go in the cave!

4231
02:59:34,570 --> 02:59:36,010
Oh thank god I have HP though.

4232
02:59:39,270 --> 02:59:41,090
Oh wait, what about the cave?

4233
02:59:43,630 --> 02:59:45,070
Wait, I'm back here.

4234
02:59:46,870 --> 02:59:47,390
What?

4235
02:59:47,390 --> 02:59:47,390
What?

4236
02:59:48,610 --> 02:59:49,930
Am I in the past?

4237
02:59:55,580 --> 02:59:58,280
Okay, I can craft... I can craft weapons!

4238
03:00:00,500 --> 03:00:01,620
What do I have?

4239
03:00:03,040 --> 03:00:05,160
Okay, this one is less strong.

4240
03:00:05,720 --> 03:00:06,380
Alright.

4241
03:00:06,980 --> 03:00:09,440
But I do have better armor now?

4242
03:00:10,080 --> 03:00:10,880
I do!

4243
03:00:11,560 --> 03:00:12,220
Alright.

4244
03:00:13,860 --> 03:00:16,280
I'll just... I'll just craft better armor.

4245
03:00:16,400 --> 03:00:16,780
Yes.

4246
03:00:18,560 --> 03:00:19,880
Uhh... yes.

4247
03:00:22,280 --> 03:00:24,140
And then... yes.

4248
03:00:24,620 --> 03:00:25,900
Ooh, my toes.

4249
03:00:26,400 --> 03:00:26,920
Alright.

4250
03:00:28,960 --> 03:00:31,080
Oh god, I need to clip my nails.

4251
03:00:31,300 --> 03:00:32,020
Did you see that?

4252
03:00:32,260 --> 03:00:32,700
Damn.

4253
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:33,380
Alright.

4254
03:00:33,660 --> 03:00:36,140
I mean, it's less attack, so...

4255
03:00:36,140 --> 03:00:38,480
I don't really want to deal with that.

4256
03:00:38,880 --> 03:00:40,180
Do I have like...

4257
03:00:40,180 --> 03:00:41,860
Can I cultivate this more?

4258
03:00:42,540 --> 03:00:43,840
Wait, no I can't.

4259
03:00:43,840 --> 03:00:44,580
Baby is...

4260
03:00:44,580 --> 03:00:46,980
I need to kill more iron bulls for it.

4261
03:00:47,140 --> 03:00:50,160
I don't want to cultivate these because I'm not going to use it anyway.

4262
03:00:51,080 --> 03:00:51,600
So...

4263
03:00:52,560 --> 03:00:53,080
Uhh...

4264
03:00:55,440 --> 03:00:58,340
I don't think I'm going to get... find any shoes, guys.

4265
03:00:58,600 --> 03:01:00,440
I don't think Monkey is going to get shoes.

4266
03:01:02,300 --> 03:01:03,780
Is there like extra stuff?

4267
03:01:06,980 --> 03:01:07,500
Okay.

4268
03:01:08,480 --> 03:01:10,260
I have to be in the past then.

4269
03:01:11,800 --> 03:01:13,440
Because like, it says like...

4270
03:01:13,960 --> 03:01:16,480
Ring the bell is open like past and future.

4271
03:01:17,100 --> 03:01:18,840
So I'm in the past right now.

4272
03:01:20,440 --> 03:01:21,600
Or future?

4273
03:01:21,660 --> 03:01:23,120
I mean, it looks destroyed.

4274
03:01:23,940 --> 03:01:26,480
It looks like older than usual.

4275
03:01:26,640 --> 03:01:27,760
So maybe I'm in the future.

4276
03:01:31,540 --> 03:01:32,240
Okay.

4277
03:01:32,240 --> 03:01:33,680
I got prayer beads.

4278
03:01:36,330 --> 03:01:37,680
Monkey paws for free?

4279
03:01:38,740 --> 03:01:39,440
Alright.

4280
03:01:41,220 --> 03:01:42,420
Stone spirits.

4281
03:01:43,920 --> 03:01:44,620
Okay.

4282
03:01:44,620 --> 03:01:45,020
Nice.

4283
03:01:48,080 --> 03:01:49,480
One more willpower.

4284
03:01:50,560 --> 03:01:51,180
Alright.

4285
03:01:53,800 --> 03:01:54,420
Okay.

4286
03:01:54,600 --> 03:01:56,600
It's time to go up.

4287
03:01:56,940 --> 03:01:58,080
I think I got like...

4288
03:01:58,800 --> 03:01:59,820
The beads.

4289
03:01:59,940 --> 03:02:00,220
Isn't it?

4290
03:02:00,320 --> 03:02:00,820
Oh wait.

4291
03:02:00,940 --> 03:02:01,160
What?

4292
03:02:01,760 --> 03:02:03,360
Where were the beads then?

4293
03:02:06,970 --> 03:02:07,590
Wait.

4294
03:02:08,460 --> 03:02:08,770
Stronger.

4295
03:02:11,330 --> 03:02:11,950
Uh...

4296
03:02:11,950 --> 03:02:12,950
Modern creases.

4297
03:02:13,170 --> 03:02:13,370
Wait.

4298
03:02:13,530 --> 03:02:14,210
This is better.

4299
03:02:15,230 --> 03:02:16,870
Oh, this is what I found.

4300
03:02:17,750 --> 03:02:18,210
Okay.

4301
03:02:18,570 --> 03:02:19,030
Okay.

4302
03:02:19,070 --> 03:02:21,090
I crafted that for no fucking reason, I guess.

4303
03:02:23,270 --> 03:02:24,250
This is better.

4304
03:02:26,250 --> 03:02:27,170
Oh shit.

4305
03:02:27,270 --> 03:02:27,470
What?

4306
03:02:35,100 --> 03:02:35,560
Okay.

4307
03:02:35,660 --> 03:02:36,740
But more damage though.

4308
03:02:36,940 --> 03:02:37,140
Ooh.

4309
03:02:37,440 --> 03:02:37,780
Wait.

4310
03:02:37,820 --> 03:02:38,500
This looks sick.

4311
03:02:42,960 --> 03:02:43,640
I don't...

4312
03:02:43,640 --> 03:02:44,020
Hmm.

4313
03:02:45,680 --> 03:02:46,800
I thought I was using...

4314
03:02:46,800 --> 03:02:48,400
Scored while sprinting.

4315
03:02:48,400 --> 03:02:49,440
Which has saved me.

4316
03:02:49,540 --> 03:02:50,320
Quite a lot.

4317
03:02:50,660 --> 03:02:52,000
But the defense though.

4318
03:02:52,120 --> 03:02:52,500
I don't know.

4319
03:02:52,500 --> 03:02:53,340
But more damage.

4320
03:02:53,400 --> 03:02:55,100
I like the damage part.

4321
03:02:57,840 --> 03:02:59,800
But the damage though.

4322
03:03:02,260 --> 03:03:03,860
It's unga bunga.

4323
03:03:13,890 --> 03:03:15,710
There's baby too?

4324
03:03:17,470 --> 03:03:18,350
There's...

4325
03:03:18,350 --> 03:03:20,890
There's baby too?

4326
03:03:21,170 --> 03:03:22,050
Oh.

4327
03:03:23,710 --> 03:03:24,290
Oh.

4328
03:03:24,310 --> 03:03:25,190
Oh.

4329
03:03:25,190 --> 03:03:26,190
Wow!

4330
03:03:27,630 --> 03:03:29,170
We got a refa.

4331
03:03:29,170 --> 03:03:29,810
There's no babies too...

4332
03:03:29,990 --> 03:03:31,690
There's baby too?

4333
03:03:31,910 --> 03:03:34,150
There's baby too.

4334
03:03:41,030 --> 03:03:43,030
There's baby too?

4335
03:03:43,290 --> 03:03:46,270
I saw baby too?

4336
03:03:46,310 --> 03:03:46,990
Baby you're back!

4337
03:03:47,970 --> 03:03:53,310
There's not baby too!

4338
03:03:53,410 --> 03:03:55,850
There's baby SO!

4339
03:03:55,850 --> 03:03:56,810
Nooo!

4340
03:03:57,410 --> 03:03:59,530
Baby brought friends!

4341
03:04:00,150 --> 03:04:01,910
Oh shit!

4342
03:04:02,130 --> 03:04:04,930
Baby brought so many friends!

4343
03:04:06,510 --> 03:04:08,870
Please, start crying baby!

4344
03:04:09,130 --> 03:04:09,950
Oh shit!

4345
03:04:11,590 --> 03:04:12,670
Boom!

4346
03:04:13,910 --> 03:04:15,130
Oh shit!

4347
03:04:15,810 --> 03:04:17,190
Oh shit!

4348
03:04:19,510 --> 03:04:22,490
These did not baby too!

4349
03:04:22,690 --> 03:04:23,850
My god!

4350
03:04:23,850 --> 03:04:26,750
Oh my god!

4351
03:04:27,690 --> 03:04:28,610
Boom!

4352
03:04:29,110 --> 03:04:31,370
Baby on baby violence!

4353
03:04:31,850 --> 03:04:33,070
Baby on...

4354
03:04:36,550 --> 03:04:39,250
I can't believe it.

4355
03:04:39,350 --> 03:04:42,950
Oh my god, baby too has... what is baby too doing?

4356
03:04:44,810 --> 03:04:46,130
What is that?

4357
03:04:51,070 --> 03:04:51,990
What?

4358
03:04:56,470 --> 03:04:57,670
What the fuck is he doing?

4359
03:05:02,970 --> 03:05:04,940
He's going super insane!

4360
03:05:07,850 --> 03:05:10,100
I don't know what baby is doing!

4361
03:05:14,870 --> 03:05:15,380
Oh god!

4362
03:05:17,010 --> 03:05:17,980
He's believing!

4363
03:05:20,880 --> 03:05:21,580
No!

4364
03:05:21,740 --> 03:05:22,980
Stop believing baby!

4365
03:05:41,840 --> 03:05:42,760
Oh god!

4366
03:05:43,380 --> 03:05:44,400
Oh god!

4367
03:05:45,180 --> 03:05:45,900
Oh god!

4368
03:05:52,720 --> 03:05:53,240
Okay.

4369
03:05:55,400 --> 03:05:57,160
Oh god, not baby too.

4370
03:05:58,700 --> 03:06:01,440
I'm so sad I have to deal with poor baby.

4371
03:06:04,760 --> 03:06:06,100
What is he doing?

4372
03:06:09,340 --> 03:06:10,680
Oh, I can heal!

4373
03:06:10,900 --> 03:06:11,960
What the fuck!

4374
03:06:11,980 --> 03:06:12,680
I can heal!

4375
03:06:13,120 --> 03:06:14,820
Why didn't I get that before?

4376
03:06:17,400 --> 03:06:18,720
This is not fair!

4377
03:06:19,840 --> 03:06:21,840
Blue baby never let me heal!

4378
03:06:25,520 --> 03:06:26,780
Holy shit!

4379
03:06:27,020 --> 03:06:29,100
Blue baby didn't let me heal!

4380
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:33,680
Okay.

4381
03:06:37,280 --> 03:06:38,580
Oh god, okay.

4382
03:06:42,630 --> 03:06:43,310
Nice!

4383
03:06:43,950 --> 03:06:46,850
Oh no, reversal.

4384
03:06:46,850 --> 03:06:47,110
Let her do it herself.

4385
03:06:50,730 --> 03:06:51,370
Oh...

4386
03:06:52,610 --> 03:06:56,590
Hundred and seventy years spent.

4387
03:07:02,130 --> 03:07:03,410
Holy shit.

4388
03:07:04,950 --> 03:07:07,630
I truly was a carygeric.

4389
03:07:09,110 --> 03:07:10,450
That's fucking right.

4390
03:07:10,610 --> 03:07:15,970
I swear to god if there's baby 3 I swear to fucking god I'm gonna find the source of all these babies.

4391
03:07:18,310 --> 03:07:20,070
And you stop the source.

4392
03:07:20,850 --> 03:07:22,170
Gotta find the mom!

4393
03:07:30,170 --> 03:07:35,270
I need to find the mother.

4394
03:07:39,390 --> 03:07:42,630
I swear if there's baby three, I swear to fucking god.

4395
03:07:42,690 --> 03:07:44,270
Baby three, that's red.

4396
03:07:49,740 --> 03:07:50,800
I did it.

4397
03:07:51,440 --> 03:07:52,200
I'm back.

4398
03:07:57,900 --> 03:07:58,460
Alright.

4399
03:07:58,560 --> 03:08:00,580
That baby really did not like me.

4400
03:08:02,340 --> 03:08:02,900
Oh.

4401
03:08:03,320 --> 03:08:03,880
Goodbye.

4402
03:08:05,040 --> 03:08:06,980
How long was he hanging there for?

4403
03:08:08,180 --> 03:08:09,660
Let everything else burn.

4404
03:08:09,840 --> 03:08:11,480
I care for nothing but my master.

4405
03:08:11,600 --> 03:08:12,780
Give it to me quickly.

4406
03:08:13,880 --> 03:08:14,440
Oh?

4407
03:08:17,520 --> 03:08:18,080
Yeah.

4408
03:08:24,180 --> 03:08:25,280
I did it.

4409
03:08:26,540 --> 03:08:27,780
I let him down.

4410
03:08:31,820 --> 03:08:33,560
Cassandra, thank you for the super chat.

4411
03:08:33,660 --> 03:08:34,000
Thank you.

4412
03:08:35,720 --> 03:08:36,160
Okay.

4413
03:08:36,160 --> 03:08:37,500
Now I can go up the cave.

4414
03:08:38,400 --> 03:08:38,840
Alright.

4415
03:08:38,940 --> 03:08:41,720
I have a T-control, but I have no idea what that is.

4416
03:08:41,920 --> 03:08:42,580
For now.

4417
03:08:42,980 --> 03:08:46,180
To be fair, I have no idea what I'm doing for my upgrades.

4418
03:08:46,340 --> 03:08:49,760
But I think I'm doing pretty well for not knowing what the fuck I'm upgrading.

4419
03:08:50,440 --> 03:08:50,880
Hahaha.

4420
03:08:52,940 --> 03:08:54,120
You know what?

4421
03:08:54,160 --> 03:08:55,160
Let's get the critical.

4422
03:08:55,680 --> 03:09:00,020
And then... I have not used the defensive thing yet.

4423
03:09:00,180 --> 03:09:03,440
It's just not... There's just no reason to.

4424
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:04,520
Alright.

4425
03:09:04,560 --> 03:09:07,300
Let's grab the... already awakened that.

4426
03:09:07,560 --> 03:09:09,180
We'll get better dodge, I feel like.

4427
03:09:09,340 --> 03:09:10,860
And then better stamina.

4428
03:09:15,880 --> 03:09:16,400
Alright.

4429
03:09:16,400 --> 03:09:17,700
Oh, I should have got that.

4430
03:09:17,740 --> 03:09:18,520
God damn it.

4431
03:09:19,520 --> 03:09:20,040
Alright.

4432
03:09:20,100 --> 03:09:20,500
Here we go.

4433
03:09:21,260 --> 03:09:24,060
I upgraded... I should have upgraded the other one.

4434
03:09:24,120 --> 03:09:25,300
Not the sprinting shit.

4435
03:09:29,800 --> 03:09:31,900
I think I'm doing pretty good with my upgrades.

4436
03:09:32,100 --> 03:09:33,200
I have no idea what I'm doing.

4437
03:09:33,280 --> 03:09:34,880
But I think I'm doing pretty good.

4438
03:09:35,260 --> 03:09:36,860
I haven't used any of my items.

4439
03:09:37,080 --> 03:09:39,060
Because I'm too scared to use my items.

4440
03:09:40,200 --> 03:09:42,240
Because I'm hoarding my items right now.

4441
03:09:42,260 --> 03:09:43,480
I'm too scared to use it.

4442
03:09:44,200 --> 03:09:44,920
Has she died?

4443
03:09:45,040 --> 03:09:45,300
Nope.

4444
03:09:46,540 --> 03:09:47,520
Not even once.

4445
03:09:47,540 --> 03:09:48,060
Right, chat?

4446
03:09:52,150 --> 03:09:52,550
Boom.

4447
03:09:53,790 --> 03:09:54,990
Guys, I haven't died once.

4448
03:09:54,990 --> 03:09:55,490
Right, guys?

4449
03:09:55,590 --> 03:09:56,710
Tell him I haven't died once.

4450
03:09:59,610 --> 03:10:00,730
Oh, shit.

4451
03:10:00,790 --> 03:10:01,850
Where is he?

4452
03:10:02,610 --> 03:10:03,170
Nope.

4453
03:10:05,950 --> 03:10:07,030
Zero death run.

4454
03:10:07,130 --> 03:10:07,610
Right here.

4455
03:10:09,450 --> 03:10:10,690
I guess this is...

4456
03:10:11,250 --> 03:10:12,450
This has to be Lu.

4457
03:10:13,510 --> 03:10:14,070
Yeah.

4458
03:10:14,190 --> 03:10:14,950
You died?

4459
03:10:15,110 --> 03:10:15,470
Exactly.

4460
03:10:16,030 --> 03:10:17,090
Zero death run.

4461
03:10:18,070 --> 03:10:19,370
Oh, time to meditate.

4462
03:10:27,400 --> 03:10:29,260
I killed two babies today.

4463
03:10:30,220 --> 03:10:31,140
But yet...

4464
03:10:31,260 --> 03:10:34,160
Why have I not yet feel enlightenment?

4465
03:10:34,760 --> 03:10:37,040
Do I have to kill a third baby?

4466
03:10:39,300 --> 03:10:40,800
Maybe even four?

4467
03:10:42,420 --> 03:10:44,940
How many more babies must die?

4468
03:10:46,300 --> 03:10:49,160
Before I can feel something in my soul.

4469
03:10:50,960 --> 03:10:52,480
Alright, meditation over.

4470
03:10:58,340 --> 03:10:59,040
Alright.

4471
03:10:59,780 --> 03:11:00,480
Yay.

4472
03:11:03,980 --> 03:11:05,260
Celestial Taiyi Pill.

4473
03:11:05,520 --> 03:11:09,320
A miraculous pill crafted by King Father on...

4474
03:11:09,320 --> 03:11:10,940
Oh, increases maximum mana.

4475
03:11:11,240 --> 03:11:12,400
God, I need that, actually.

4476
03:11:14,420 --> 03:11:15,720
I need more mushrooms.

4477
03:11:16,960 --> 03:11:17,500
Alright.

4478
03:11:19,240 --> 03:11:19,980
Let's see.

4479
03:11:20,120 --> 03:11:21,020
I think I need...

4480
03:11:21,020 --> 03:11:23,400
I will upgrade the sprint here.

4481
03:11:23,460 --> 03:11:23,880
This one.

4482
03:11:24,760 --> 03:11:26,580
To increase my stamina rate.

4483
03:11:27,100 --> 03:11:29,300
Now I don't know what to do after that.

4484
03:11:29,500 --> 03:11:29,640
I...

4485
03:11:31,360 --> 03:11:33,160
Now I don't know what else to upgrade.

4486
03:11:34,800 --> 03:11:35,280
Alright.

4487
03:11:37,820 --> 03:11:41,320
Not gonna lie, I really like this game so far.

4488
03:11:41,920 --> 03:11:42,380
I...

4489
03:11:42,940 --> 03:11:45,640
So far, this game has been really, really fun.

4490
03:11:48,720 --> 03:11:49,200
Alright.

4491
03:11:49,320 --> 03:11:49,840
Let's go.

4492
03:11:51,060 --> 03:11:51,900
Get over here.

4493
03:11:53,520 --> 03:11:56,500
And there is no, like, difficulty setting.

4494
03:11:56,760 --> 03:11:59,640
So, like, I'm playing as it's intended.

4495
03:12:01,620 --> 03:12:02,220
Boom.

4496
03:12:03,360 --> 03:12:03,960
Yeah.

4497
03:12:06,380 --> 03:12:07,340
Alright, nice.

4498
03:12:09,480 --> 03:12:11,940
Should have practiced more.

4499
03:12:13,960 --> 03:12:15,820
Yeah, maybe you should have.

4500
03:12:16,640 --> 03:12:17,540
Wait, who's that?

4501
03:12:19,540 --> 03:12:20,140
Alright.

4502
03:12:20,780 --> 03:12:21,840
Get over here.

4503
03:12:23,140 --> 03:12:23,880
That's right.

4504
03:12:23,940 --> 03:12:25,580
You should have practiced too, bitch.

4505
03:12:26,020 --> 03:12:26,920
You know what?

4506
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:27,440
Fuck you.

4507
03:12:27,460 --> 03:12:28,080
Let's freeze you.

4508
03:12:29,320 --> 03:12:30,440
I don't even care.

4509
03:12:31,040 --> 03:12:31,720
Oh, wait.

4510
03:12:31,860 --> 03:12:33,020
I don't regen mana.

4511
03:12:33,200 --> 03:12:34,040
Maybe I should have.

4512
03:12:34,220 --> 03:12:34,500
Okay.

4513
03:12:34,580 --> 03:12:35,000
Fuck.

4514
03:12:35,960 --> 03:12:39,260
I don't know how to get back mana, so I still don't know.

4515
03:12:39,720 --> 03:12:41,320
I guess I have to use my items?

4516
03:12:43,180 --> 03:12:44,960
I don't wanna use my items.

4517
03:12:45,740 --> 03:12:47,760
But my mana doesn't regenerate.

4518
03:12:50,460 --> 03:12:51,040
What's that?

4519
03:12:53,300 --> 03:12:54,360
Why is it vibrating?

4520
03:12:55,400 --> 03:12:56,480
Is it, like, the sauna?

4521
03:12:57,460 --> 03:12:58,500
Hello, sirs.

4522
03:13:00,260 --> 03:13:01,180
Give me a sec.

4523
03:13:06,420 --> 03:13:06,940
Boom.

4524
03:13:07,440 --> 03:13:09,140
Oh, you are weak as fuck.

4525
03:13:09,760 --> 03:13:10,620
Oh, fuck.

4526
03:13:10,660 --> 03:13:11,120
I'm sorry.

4527
03:13:12,380 --> 03:13:13,220
Not you.

4528
03:13:13,500 --> 03:13:14,700
I didn't mean you.

4529
03:13:15,900 --> 03:13:17,120
I meant your brother.

4530
03:13:17,660 --> 03:13:18,740
That I'm getting killed.

4531
03:13:19,940 --> 03:13:20,660
That's right.

4532
03:13:20,680 --> 03:13:22,380
You were weak as fuck too.

4533
03:13:26,020 --> 03:13:26,720
Let's see.

4534
03:13:26,800 --> 03:13:27,420
Don't you crowd?

4535
03:13:27,560 --> 03:13:28,580
Yeah, but like...

4536
03:13:29,400 --> 03:13:30,920
What if I need it later?

4537
03:13:31,760 --> 03:13:32,460
In game?

4538
03:13:35,300 --> 03:13:37,380
Yeah, what if we need it later in Wukong 2?

4539
03:13:37,920 --> 03:13:38,680
You know...

4540
03:13:39,900 --> 03:13:40,380
Guys.

4541
03:13:40,660 --> 03:13:43,480
What if I need to use it in Wukong 2, guys?

4542
03:13:43,640 --> 03:13:44,700
You don't understand.

4543
03:13:46,820 --> 03:13:47,640
Oh, shit.

4544
03:13:47,740 --> 03:13:48,320
Burn resistance.

4545
03:13:48,940 --> 03:13:52,120
Feels additional damage to the enemy upon crashing.

4546
03:13:52,480 --> 03:13:53,620
Oh, I like that.

4547
03:13:54,940 --> 03:13:55,880
I want that.

4548
03:13:56,740 --> 03:13:57,220
Yes.

4549
03:13:58,700 --> 03:13:59,980
Oh, now I'm broke.

4550
03:14:02,960 --> 03:14:04,320
Deals additional damage.

4551
03:14:04,620 --> 03:14:06,160
God damn it.

4552
03:14:06,160 --> 03:14:06,560
I'm broke.

4553
03:14:07,980 --> 03:14:08,400
Okay.

4554
03:14:08,400 --> 03:14:08,820
Wait.

4555
03:14:08,920 --> 03:14:09,740
Can I buy silk?

4556
03:14:09,920 --> 03:14:10,140
Wait.

4557
03:14:10,180 --> 03:14:10,840
I can buy silk.

4558
03:14:11,040 --> 03:14:11,380
I forgot.

4559
03:14:11,900 --> 03:14:12,320
Yarn.

4560
03:14:12,520 --> 03:14:13,220
No, I cannot.

4561
03:14:13,760 --> 03:14:14,400
Never mind.

4562
03:14:15,720 --> 03:14:17,080
Who the fuck has silk?

4563
03:14:18,060 --> 03:14:19,880
Who do I need to kill to have silk?

4564
03:14:24,880 --> 03:14:26,320
This feels like you'll fight a fire.

4565
03:14:26,440 --> 03:14:27,260
Yeah, I know.

4566
03:14:27,380 --> 03:14:28,180
I can tell.

4567
03:14:31,560 --> 03:14:32,620
Who do I have to kill?

4568
03:14:34,460 --> 03:14:35,540
God damn it.

4569
03:14:40,600 --> 03:14:44,560
Okay, clearly we don't have enough for it yet.

4570
03:14:44,880 --> 03:14:45,320
Weapons?

4571
03:14:45,420 --> 03:14:46,480
Do I have enough for it?

4572
03:14:46,580 --> 03:14:47,960
No, it's still the wooden...

4573
03:14:49,960 --> 03:14:50,400
Alright.

4574
03:14:50,660 --> 03:14:52,440
I need to find some silk, guys.

4575
03:14:53,660 --> 03:14:56,780
I need to kill some spiders, some silkworms.

4576
03:15:01,040 --> 03:15:01,480
Alright.

4577
03:15:02,980 --> 03:15:04,020
Do I need silk here?

4578
03:15:05,660 --> 03:15:06,520
Do I need silk here?

4579
03:15:06,540 --> 03:15:07,080
Silkworms?

4580
03:15:07,100 --> 03:15:08,580
Oh, hey there, big boy!

4581
03:15:09,240 --> 03:15:11,320
When am I gonna meet my...

4582
03:15:12,140 --> 03:15:13,220
my master?

4583
03:15:13,580 --> 03:15:14,620
Like, Sifu.

4584
03:15:16,400 --> 03:15:17,860
Black Wind King.

4585
03:15:21,720 --> 03:15:23,460
When will I meet the pig guy?

4586
03:15:24,290 --> 03:15:25,220
And the other guy?

4587
03:15:25,600 --> 03:15:27,020
I don't care as much.

4588
03:15:28,760 --> 03:15:32,560
All those monks consumed by the fire.

4589
03:15:32,780 --> 03:15:35,080
Wait, he said fire.

4590
03:15:35,620 --> 03:15:37,840
Roaming in Black Wind Mountain.

4591
03:15:38,320 --> 03:15:38,820
Thanos?

4592
03:15:39,320 --> 03:15:44,720
It was I who granted them eternal repose.

4593
03:15:46,600 --> 03:15:51,720
I have even restored the charred scriptures piece by piece.

4594
03:15:55,400 --> 03:15:56,460
Where's his neck?

4595
03:15:56,740 --> 03:15:58,600
But oh yes, I always did.

4596
03:15:59,660 --> 03:16:01,640
One day you shall return.

4597
03:16:02,200 --> 03:16:03,980
Now I'm just like, who the fuck are you?

4598
03:16:07,500 --> 03:16:08,620
That's fucking right.

4599
03:16:09,120 --> 03:16:09,680
Baby.

4600
03:16:11,460 --> 03:16:12,780
Oh god, I...

4601
03:16:13,760 --> 03:16:15,540
Like, what is he?

4602
03:16:15,660 --> 03:16:16,220
Is he...

4603
03:16:16,220 --> 03:16:17,820
What the fuck?

4604
03:16:18,340 --> 03:16:20,420
Where is he?

4605
03:16:20,620 --> 03:16:21,700
How do I feel?

4606
03:16:21,720 --> 03:16:22,520
How do I fight the wind?

4607
03:16:24,740 --> 03:16:25,780
It's not fair.

4608
03:16:25,800 --> 03:16:26,640
He's literally wind.

4609
03:16:28,700 --> 03:16:29,820
Oh shit.

4610
03:16:32,880 --> 03:16:33,440
Okay.

4611
03:16:34,240 --> 03:16:35,500
This is not fair.

4612
03:16:35,700 --> 03:16:37,060
He's literally fucking wind.

4613
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:39,540
How do you fight the wind?

4614
03:16:41,680 --> 03:16:42,240
Okay.

4615
03:16:44,140 --> 03:16:45,240
Alright, there we go.

4616
03:16:48,180 --> 03:16:48,740
Alright.

4617
03:16:49,600 --> 03:16:50,380
Let's see.

4618
03:16:52,360 --> 03:16:53,280
Oh god.

4619
03:16:54,340 --> 03:16:55,200
He's the wind.

4620
03:16:55,640 --> 03:16:56,120
No.

4621
03:16:57,320 --> 03:16:58,680
I'm gonna punch the wind.

4622
03:16:59,160 --> 03:17:00,980
Oh shit, not now though.

4623
03:17:02,080 --> 03:17:02,900
I'll punch him.

4624
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:03,860
Oh fuck.

4625
03:17:05,900 --> 03:17:07,660
I'm gonna punch the wind now.

4626
03:17:07,720 --> 03:17:08,840
I'm gonna punch the wind.

4627
03:17:09,440 --> 03:17:13,340
I lied about all the other times, but this time I'm gonna punch the wind.

4628
03:17:14,140 --> 03:17:14,620
Wait.

4629
03:17:14,740 --> 03:17:15,740
Where did he go?

4630
03:17:19,100 --> 03:17:19,920
Oh my god.

4631
03:17:20,060 --> 03:17:21,280
Where did the wind go?

4632
03:17:21,720 --> 03:17:23,120
Where did the wind go?

4633
03:17:23,360 --> 03:17:23,440
Where did the wind go?

4634
03:17:25,280 --> 03:17:25,960
Okay.

4635
03:17:26,660 --> 03:17:27,340
Alright.

4636
03:17:29,900 --> 03:17:30,580
Okay.

4637
03:17:31,540 --> 03:17:32,220
Alright.

4638
03:17:32,800 --> 03:17:34,880
The wind is so strong.

4639
03:17:36,220 --> 03:17:37,220
Oh no.

4640
03:17:37,300 --> 03:17:38,040
Not more wind.

4641
03:17:38,840 --> 03:17:39,520
No.

4642
03:17:39,620 --> 03:17:40,960
Not more wind.

4643
03:17:41,220 --> 03:17:43,800
I don't know how to deal with wind.

4644
03:17:44,220 --> 03:17:44,900
No.

4645
03:17:47,950 --> 03:17:48,630
Alright.

4646
03:17:51,490 --> 03:17:52,330
Guys.

4647
03:17:52,670 --> 03:17:55,050
Why is the wind so...

4648
03:17:55,050 --> 03:17:56,410
Why can't you kill...

4649
03:17:56,410 --> 03:17:57,370
stab the wind?

4650
03:17:58,330 --> 03:18:00,110
He's an airbender.

4651
03:18:00,750 --> 03:18:01,590
Quick.

4652
03:18:02,490 --> 03:18:04,750
Somebody get a vacuum cleaner.

4653
03:18:07,670 --> 03:18:09,290
Holy shit.

4654
03:18:09,630 --> 03:18:14,170
Somebody fucking grab a vacuum cleaner and stop this man.

4655
03:18:14,650 --> 03:18:17,510
Why so eager to die?

4656
03:18:17,510 --> 03:18:18,970
Let's go through right.

4657
03:18:18,990 --> 03:18:19,330
Baby.

4658
03:18:20,550 --> 03:18:21,310
Baby.

4659
03:18:22,430 --> 03:18:23,670
Oh no.

4660
03:18:24,250 --> 03:18:25,010
Okay.

4661
03:18:25,130 --> 03:18:25,630
Nice.

4662
03:18:25,890 --> 03:18:26,650
No.

4663
03:18:29,230 --> 03:18:29,610
No.

4664
03:18:29,650 --> 03:18:29,830
Okay.

4665
03:18:31,910 --> 03:18:32,670
Alright.

4666
03:18:34,790 --> 03:18:35,950
Wolf time.

4667
03:18:36,870 --> 03:18:37,990
Wolf time.

4668
03:18:38,930 --> 03:18:39,750
Wolf time.

4669
03:18:39,750 --> 03:18:40,930
Oh I fucked it up.

4670
03:18:45,010 --> 03:18:46,670
Oh shit.

4671
03:18:47,390 --> 03:18:49,230
Wind doesn't have fire?

4672
03:18:50,010 --> 03:18:51,370
What the fuck did I do?

4673
03:18:52,710 --> 03:18:53,590
What is this?

4674
03:18:53,730 --> 03:18:54,450
What is this?

4675
03:19:01,190 --> 03:19:01,670
Okay.

4676
03:19:02,950 --> 03:19:03,430
Fuck!

4677
03:19:05,830 --> 03:19:06,310
Alright.

4678
03:19:07,810 --> 03:19:08,290
Alright.

4679
03:19:08,970 --> 03:19:09,450
Nice.

4680
03:19:11,530 --> 03:19:12,010
Alright.

4681
03:19:12,270 --> 03:19:12,850
It's okay.

4682
03:19:14,590 --> 03:19:15,070
Okay.

4683

Oh no.

Wait.

4695
03:19:55,620 --> 03:19:56,600
He can heal too?

03:19:57,800 --> 03:19:59,600
That's fucked man.

4699
03:20:05,100 --> 03:20:07,020
I'm already a monkey.

4700
03:20:07,240 --> 03:20:08,720
And you're just gonna...

4701
03:20:08,720 --> 03:20:09,440

03:20:11,860 --> 03:20:12,620
Okay.

4704
03:20:12,660 --> 03:20:13,100
Nice.

4705
03:20:13,260 --> 03:20:14,920
Oh fuck.

03:20:16,600 --> 03:20:17,400
Oh!

4708
03:20:21,100 --> 03:20:24,080
This is so fucked man.

4709
03:20:27,560 --> 03:20:29,300
Bro I'm already a monkey.

4710
03:20:30,340 --> 03:20:32,000
I'm already at a disadvantage.

4711
03:20:33,660 --> 03:20:34,680
Oh no!

4712
03:20:35,740 --> 03:20:36,480
No!

4713
03:20:44,220 --> 03:20:45,620
That's not fair.

4714
03:20:46,200 --> 03:20:47,000
It's...

4715
03:20:48,200 --> 03:20:48,900
It's not fair.

4716
03:20:51,500 --> 03:20:52,860
Holy shit.

4717
03:20:53,500 --> 03:20:57,500
I don't know how to fucking punch the... kill the wind.

4718
03:21:00,020 --> 03:21:02,100
Why can't I just breathe him in?

4719
03:21:07,040 --> 03:21:07,720
Yes.

4720
03:21:08,400 --> 03:21:09,520

Okay.

4752
03:22:10,520 --> 03:22:11,180
Black wind.

4753
03:22:11,260 --> 03:22:11,540
No!

4754
03:22:11,600 --> 03:22:12,640

Let's go.

03:22:26,740 --> 03:22:27,780
Let's go!

4762
03:22:28,060 --> 03:22:28,920

Okay.

03:22:32,420 --> 03:22:33,900
Oh shit no.

Oh please!

4768
03:22:40,160 --> 03:22:41,160
Oh god.

4769
03:22:43,780 --> 03:22:45,140
Oh shit fire!

4770
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:47,620
I only have one heals left.

4771
03:22:49,600 --> 03:22:50,120
Alright.

4772
03:22:53,900 --> 03:22:54,420
Okay.

4773
03:22:54,420 --> 03:22:54,940
Woo!

4774
03:22:58,400 --> 03:22:59,080
Oh god.

4775
03:22:59,120 --> 03:22:59,700
Is it wind time?

4776
03:22:59,920 --> 03:23:00,600
Where is he?

4777
03:23:00,700 --> 03:23:01,340
Where is he?

4778
03:23:01,380 --> 03:23:01,420
No!

4779
03:23:03,200 --> 03:23:03,960
Oh god!

4780
03:23:05,820 --> 03:23:06,880
This is not fair!

4781
03:23:07,720 --> 03:23:08,240
No!

4782
03:23:08,240 --> 03:23:10,080
He has so many attacks!

4783
03:23:10,080 --> 03:23:13,060
Do you still think you are better than us?

4784
03:23:13,220 --> 03:23:14,520
No I don't!

4785
03:23:14,520 --> 03:23:14,900
Please!

4786
03:23:14,980 --> 03:23:16,060
I actually don't!

4787
03:23:17,380 --> 03:23:18,820
I don't think!

4788
03:23:18,960 --> 03:23:20,240
I don't think so!

4789
03:23:20,280 --> 03:23:21,000
I'm just monkey!

4790
03:23:21,860 --> 03:23:23,720
I'm just trying to find some bananas!

4791
03:23:24,640 --> 03:23:25,280
Please!

4792
03:23:25,940 --> 03:23:26,780
I don't!

4793

No!

4794
03:23:30,180 --> 03:23:32,080
We were so close!

4795
03:23:33,580 --> 03:23:34,820
Oh shit!

4796
03:23:34,820 --> 03:23:35,060
Please!

4797
03:23:35,100 --> 03:23:39,780
I was just trying to find some bananas!

4798
03:23:40,460 --> 03:23:42,740
I'm not here for this!

4799
03:23:48,380 --> 03:23:49,820
Holy shit!

4800
03:23:50,920 --> 03:23:52,960
Oh my god!

4801
03:23:53,140 --> 03:23:55,100
This guy is so difficult!

4802
03:23:59,720 --> 03:24:00,680
Boom!

4803
03:24:05,320 --> 03:24:06,060
Okay!

4804
03:24:06,060 --> 03:24:10,380
Who are you to stand against me?

4805
03:24:10,500 --> 03:24:10,700
Okay!

4806
03:24:11,700 --> 03:24:12,440
Nice!

4807
03:24:13,360 --> 03:24:14,100
Woah!

03:24:14,560 --> 03:24:14,820
Woah!

4810
03:24:14,820 --> 03:24:15,180
Woah!

4811
03:24:15,980 --> 03:24:16,720
Boom!

4812
03:24:21,560 --> 03:24:22,300
Boom!

4813

Fire!

4814
03:24:24,460 --> 03:24:25,200
Fire!

4815
03:24:26,610 --> 03:24:27,180
Oh god!

4816
03:24:30,060 --> 03:24:30,940
Come on!

4817
03:24:31,400 --> 03:24:32,140
Shit!

4818
03:24:32,200 --> 03:24:32,560
Okay!

4819
03:24:32,700 --> 03:24:33,840
There's too many!

4820
03:24:34,510 --> 03:24:34,880
Fire!

4821
03:24:34,980 --> 03:24:35,320
Wind!

4822
03:24:35,420 --> 03:24:35,880
Everything!

4823
03:24:37,480 --> 03:24:38,280
Oh god!

4824
03:24:39,320 --> 03:24:39,880
Okay!

4825
03:24:40,040 --> 03:24:42,140
I am the Black Wind!

4826
03:24:43,240 --> 03:24:43,800
Okay!

4827
03:24:44,460 --> 03:24:45,020
Alright!

4828
03:24:46,160 --> 03:24:47,020
Wind time!

4829
03:24:47,120 --> 03:24:47,620
Wind time!

4830
03:24:47,900 --> 03:24:48,340
Alright!

4831
03:24:48,420 --> 03:24:49,020
Wind gun!

4832
03:24:49,120 --> 03:24:49,620
Wind gun!

4833
03:24:50,760 --> 03:24:51,320
Wind!

4834
03:24:52,720 --> 03:24:53,280
Right!

4835
03:24:53,960 --> 03:24:54,520
Oh!

4836
03:25:00,050 --> 03:25:01,030
Get over here!

4837
03:25:02,190 --> 03:25:03,030
Oh no!

4838
03:25:03,190 --> 03:25:03,810
Oh no!

4839
03:25:03,870 --> 03:25:04,310
I lied!

4840
03:25:04,550 --> 03:25:05,190
No I didn't!

4841
03:25:05,250 --> 03:25:06,490
I was joking!

4842
03:25:06,650 --> 03:25:07,190
I was joking!

4843
03:25:07,270 --> 03:25:08,110
Don't get over here!

4844
03:25:10,050 --> 03:25:11,710
I was also joking!

4845
03:25:11,930 --> 03:25:13,450
Please don't get over here!

4846
03:25:14,770 --> 03:25:16,010
Oh shit!

4847
03:25:16,210 --> 03:25:17,970
I didn't mean it!

4848
03:25:17,990 --> 03:25:18,450
I'm sorry!

4849
03:25:20,330 --> 03:25:21,590
Oh god!

4850
03:25:21,710 --> 03:25:23,350
I didn't mean it!

4851
03:25:23,570 --> 03:25:24,910
Oh shit!

4852
03:25:25,750 --> 03:25:26,650
Oh fuck!

4853
03:25:26,950 --> 03:25:28,050
Bro please!

4854
03:25:29,050 --> 03:25:29,770
Please!

4855
03:25:29,810 --> 03:25:30,910
Let me live!

4856
03:25:34,410 --> 03:25:37,190
This is definitely the worst I've ever done!

4857
03:25:41,610 --> 03:25:42,890
Jesus Christ!

4858
03:25:44,190 --> 03:25:45,070
Oh!

4859
03:25:47,850 --> 03:25:48,730
Okay!

4860
03:25:56,770 --> 03:25:58,430
Holy fuck!

4861
03:25:58,750 --> 03:26:00,870
The beginning worked really well!

4862
03:26:01,230 --> 03:26:03,290
The beginning was pretty good!

4863
03:26:03,790 --> 03:26:05,030
The beginning was pretty good!

4864
03:26:05,030 --> 03:26:07,490
And then everything went downhill!

4865
03:26:07,930 --> 03:26:08,650
And then everything went downhill!

4866
03:26:08,650 --> 03:26:10,870
Everything went fucking downhill man!

4867
03:26:11,230 --> 03:26:11,250
Everything went fucking downhill man!

4868
03:26:11,710 --> 03:26:13,450
Jesus Christ!

4869
03:26:13,530 --> 03:26:15,090
Do I have any upgrades?

4870
03:26:15,090 --> 03:26:16,010
No!

4871
03:26:16,290 --> 03:26:16,610
Okay!

4872
03:26:17,350 --> 03:26:17,910
Alright!

4873
03:26:17,990 --> 03:26:19,330
What do I have in my inventory?

4874
03:26:19,850 --> 03:26:20,410
Okay!

4875
03:26:20,850 --> 03:26:21,870
I have...

4876
03:26:22,670 --> 03:26:24,910
Upon use considerably increased stamina!

4877
03:26:25,210 --> 03:26:26,450
I think it's time!

4878
03:26:26,630 --> 03:26:27,190
Guys!

4879
03:26:27,270 --> 03:26:28,650
I think it's time!

4880
03:26:29,050 --> 03:26:29,590
Alright!

4881
03:26:32,710 --> 03:26:33,830
I think...

4882
03:26:33,830 --> 03:26:35,070
No I don't need it!

4883
03:26:35,250 --> 03:26:35,570
No!

4884
03:26:35,610 --> 03:26:37,190
What if I use it and then I die?

4885
03:26:37,630 --> 03:26:39,790
What if I use it and then I die?

4886
03:26:40,030 --> 03:26:40,590
Guys!

4887
03:26:40,750 --> 03:26:41,710
Maybe you're right!

4888
03:26:41,710 --> 03:26:44,890
I feel like I'm gonna use it and then I'm gonna die!

4889
03:26:46,410 --> 03:26:47,930
I feel like I'm gonna use it and then I'm gonna die!

4890
03:26:48,550 --> 03:26:49,870
That's fucking right!

4891
03:26:50,250 --> 03:26:51,170
That's fucking right!

4892
03:26:52,550 --> 03:26:53,310
Okay!

4893
03:26:56,430 --> 03:26:57,190
Okay!

4894
03:26:57,310 --> 03:26:59,070
Is he gonna fly?

4895
03:26:59,690 --> 03:27:03,970
Is he gonna fly?

4896
03:27:03,970 --> 03:27:04,330
Boom!

4897
03:27:04,730 --> 03:27:05,490
Boom!

4898
03:27:06,030 --> 03:27:06,790
Boom!

4899
03:27:07,490 --> 03:27:08,170
Boom!

4900
03:27:18,030 --> 03:27:19,290
I don't know what this does!

4901
03:27:19,450 --> 03:27:20,930
But like I have some...

4902
03:27:20,930 --> 03:27:21,690
I used something!

4903
03:27:23,770 --> 03:27:24,670
What is tea?

4904
03:27:25,950 --> 03:27:27,690
I don't know what tea is!

4905
03:27:27,930 --> 03:27:28,650
I've ruined everything!

4906
03:27:33,650 --> 03:27:34,950
What did I activate?

4907
03:27:35,210 --> 03:27:35,770
I don't know!

4908
03:27:36,450 --> 03:27:39,030
I actually don't know what I activated!

4909
03:27:41,050 --> 03:27:42,330
It's just the tea!

4910
03:27:45,950 --> 03:27:46,690
Oh no!

4911
03:27:47,590 --> 03:27:48,350
Oh god!

4912
03:27:49,730 --> 03:27:50,630
Oh fuck!

4913
03:27:52,810 --> 03:27:53,390
Okay!

4914
03:27:53,690 --> 03:27:54,790
It's not fair!

4915
03:27:55,350 --> 03:27:56,630
She's drinking too!

4916
03:27:58,110 --> 03:27:58,690
Alright!

4917
03:27:59,050 --> 03:27:59,630
Okay!

4918
03:28:02,970 --> 03:28:03,550
Alright!

4919
03:28:04,530 --> 03:28:05,110
Okay!

4920
03:28:06,570 --> 03:28:07,770
It's just a drink!

4921
03:28:07,890 --> 03:28:08,170
Okay!

4922
03:28:08,210 --> 03:28:08,610
That's cool!

4923
03:28:10,090 --> 03:28:10,670
Oh!

4924
03:28:12,390 --> 03:28:12,970
Okay!

4925
03:28:16,710 --> 03:28:17,290
Boom!

4926
03:28:18,230 --> 03:28:19,430
I don't know what I...

4927
03:28:19,430 --> 03:28:20,070
Oh shit!

4928
03:28:21,190 --> 03:28:21,670
Oh god!

4929
03:28:22,890 --> 03:28:23,570
Oh god!

4930
03:28:25,050 --> 03:28:25,730
Okay!

4931
03:28:28,290 --> 03:28:28,970
What?

4932
03:28:29,890 --> 03:28:30,570
What?

4933
03:28:31,670 --> 03:28:33,170
That's actually not fair!

4934
03:28:34,350 --> 03:28:36,790
That's not fair!

4935
03:28:37,470 --> 03:28:38,830
You're supposed to be frozen!

4936
03:28:43,470 --> 03:28:45,090
You're supposed to be frozen!

4937
03:28:45,090 --> 03:28:45,490
You're supposed to be frozen!

4938
03:28:50,080 --> 03:28:50,800
Okay!

4939
03:28:53,560 --> 03:28:54,500
Oh god!

4940
03:28:58,040 --> 03:28:58,760
Oh!

4941
03:29:00,840 --> 03:29:03,480
You can't freeze the wind!

4942
03:29:05,280 --> 03:29:07,560
You can't freeze the wind!

4943
03:29:07,560 --> 03:29:07,580
You can't freeze the wind!

4944
03:29:07,580 --> 03:29:08,380
What do you mean?

4945
03:29:08,500 --> 03:29:10,140
You're literally the wind!

4946
03:29:10,640 --> 03:29:12,500
What do you fucking mean?

4947
03:29:12,680 --> 03:29:14,620
You're literally the fucking wind!

4948
03:29:14,700 --> 03:29:16,140
And I'm the cheap trick?

4949
03:29:16,140 --> 03:29:18,020
You turn into wind!

4950
03:29:18,620 --> 03:29:20,580
I'm just a monkey!

4951
03:29:21,440 --> 03:29:22,680
I'm just the monkey!

4952
03:29:23,240 --> 03:29:31,280
The spell he just cast The spell he just cast may appear intricate The spell he just cast may appear intricate But it's not hard to learn Are you sure?

4953
03:29:31,280 --> 03:29:32,320
Thank you for the super chat!

4954
03:29:32,440 --> 03:29:32,660
Thank you!

4955
03:29:33,020 --> 03:29:40,160
But what he left here But what he left here could surely help us He probably left

4956
03:29:43,200 --> 03:29:45,240
I don't feel so lucky, man.

4957
03:29:48,240 --> 03:29:49,540
What did I get?

4958
03:29:50,900 --> 03:29:51,360
What?

4959
03:29:52,000 --> 03:29:52,640
Cloud step.

4960
03:29:53,200 --> 03:29:54,900
I'm the wind!

4961
03:29:57,380 --> 03:30:01,540
What you gonna do now that I'm the wind?

4962
03:30:05,940 --> 03:30:08,260
Nothing can stop me now.

4963
03:30:09,020 --> 03:30:11,300
Now I am the wind.

4964
03:30:18,540 --> 03:30:20,940
I'm the wind now, bitch.

4965
03:30:24,360 --> 03:30:26,900
Oh my god, I feel so powerful now.

4966
03:30:27,280 --> 03:30:28,840
I feel so strong.

4967
03:30:32,100 --> 03:30:33,860
Wait, there's a jar.

4968
03:30:36,140 --> 03:30:37,220
Open the jar.

4969
03:30:39,180 --> 03:30:39,740
Materials.

4970
03:30:39,940 --> 03:30:40,100
Oh!

4971
03:30:40,300 --> 03:30:42,820
That upgrades my staff?

4972
03:30:43,240 --> 03:30:43,960
I didn't think.

4973
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:46,800
That's right.

4974
03:30:48,280 --> 03:30:50,800
Nothing can stop me now that I'm the wind.

4975
03:30:53,760 --> 03:30:54,920
Alright, let's see.

4976
03:30:55,120 --> 03:30:56,980
Let's hope nobody brings a vacuum.

4977
03:31:02,300 --> 03:31:03,740
Oh, fucking hell.

4978
03:31:05,080 --> 03:31:06,860
That shit was so stressful.

4979
03:31:08,260 --> 03:31:10,320
I'm so happy he did not have a phase 2.

4980
03:31:10,500 --> 03:31:12,100
I'm so fucking happy.

4981
03:31:15,940 --> 03:31:16,540
Alright.

4982
03:31:20,000 --> 03:31:21,980
We go this way.

4983
03:31:27,400 --> 03:31:28,000
Alright.

4984
03:31:28,520 --> 03:31:31,140
Go to somebody's...

4985
03:31:31,140 --> 03:31:32,420
Let's just upgrade.

4986
03:31:32,780 --> 03:31:39,520
Let's just cool down a little bit and upgrade some... We have enough for one upgrade.

4987
03:31:40,220 --> 03:31:40,820
Okay.

4988
03:31:41,420 --> 03:31:41,900
Spells.

4989
03:31:42,080 --> 03:31:43,000
Alright, what does this do?

4990
03:31:43,360 --> 03:31:45,700
Increases each talent level.

4991
03:31:45,820 --> 03:31:48,740
It considerably increases the maximum health of the decoy.

4992
03:31:50,320 --> 03:31:51,520
Oh, he's gonna hit.

4993
03:31:51,580 --> 03:31:53,140
Oh, it distracts him.

4994
03:32:00,310 --> 03:32:00,790
Okay.

4995
03:32:00,870 --> 03:32:01,190
Okay.

4996
03:32:04,010 --> 03:32:04,150
Oh!

4997
03:32:05,390 --> 03:32:06,450
I'm gonna grab this.

4998
03:32:06,750 --> 03:32:09,970
Cause like, when I'm out of it, then I have like a stronger attack.

4999
03:32:10,310 --> 03:32:10,550
Right?

5000
03:32:11,410 --> 03:32:12,970
I assume that's what it is.

5001
03:32:19,880 --> 03:32:21,600
Why do I need to like sidestep?

5002
03:32:21,640 --> 03:32:22,520
There's so much space.

5003
03:32:24,380 --> 03:32:24,840
Wukong.

5004
03:32:24,840 --> 03:32:27,060
You're not... Your chest is not that big.

5005
03:32:27,160 --> 03:32:27,980
I'm sorry, man.

5006
03:32:28,240 --> 03:32:31,420
You did not need to sidestep that.

5007
03:32:36,100 --> 03:32:37,020
Oh my god.

5008
03:32:37,080 --> 03:32:38,380
I got the cloning technique.

5009
03:32:38,480 --> 03:32:38,820
Yeah.

5010
03:32:39,300 --> 03:32:41,060
Yeah, he was known for that too.

5011
03:32:47,410 --> 03:32:49,770
Will I have the multiple wukongs though?

5012
03:32:50,390 --> 03:32:51,550
Do I get a new weapon?

5013
03:32:51,730 --> 03:32:51,970
No.

5014
03:32:52,230 --> 03:32:52,470
Okay.

5015
03:32:52,590 --> 03:32:53,830
Maybe I can...

5016
03:32:54,670 --> 03:32:57,530
Uh... I should be able to... Wait.

5017
03:32:57,630 --> 03:32:59,890
Do I have like new spells that... No, I can't.

5018
03:32:59,970 --> 03:33:01,050
I need iron bull.

5019
03:33:02,450 --> 03:33:03,050
Uh...

5020
03:33:04,350 --> 03:33:05,250
Craft armor.

5021
03:33:06,230 --> 03:33:06,830
Okay.

5022
03:33:06,830 --> 03:33:07,770
Do I have enough for...

5023
03:33:07,770 --> 03:33:08,730
No.

5024
03:33:09,010 --> 03:33:11,630
I still... I still haven't killed silk stuff.

5025
03:33:12,270 --> 03:33:13,430
God damn it.

5026
03:33:13,830 --> 03:33:15,330
Do I have anything?

5027
03:33:15,770 --> 03:33:16,350
Right?

5028
03:33:18,930 --> 03:33:19,530
Uh...

5029
03:33:20,230 --> 03:33:20,950
Set spells.

5030
03:33:21,130 --> 03:33:21,730
Cultivate.

5031
03:33:21,730 --> 03:33:22,030
Store.

5032
03:33:22,490 --> 03:33:22,950
Sell.

5033
03:33:23,130 --> 03:33:24,210
I'm just gonna rest up.

5034
03:33:27,270 --> 03:33:27,730
Okay.

5035
03:33:27,870 --> 03:33:29,470
No, I can only craft right now.

5036
03:33:29,770 --> 03:33:31,890
I think... I think weapon upgrades?

5037
03:33:33,450 --> 03:33:33,910
Uh...

5038
03:33:34,850 --> 03:33:35,490
Let's see.

5039
03:33:35,770 --> 03:33:36,230
Inventory.

5040
03:33:38,530 --> 03:33:40,150
Yeah, I can't do anything yet.

5041
03:33:41,870 --> 03:33:43,590
Oh, this is... I was like...

5042
03:33:43,590 --> 03:33:45,690
Some hidden vessels left by can be discovered.

5043
03:33:45,750 --> 03:33:48,110
Each using them costs chi, which can be recovered.

5044
03:33:48,310 --> 03:33:49,090
But what does it do?

5045
03:33:51,130 --> 03:33:51,710
Oh!

5046
03:33:51,930 --> 03:33:53,450
It's just burn immunity!

5047
03:33:53,990 --> 03:33:55,430
Okay, that was useless.

5048
03:33:55,630 --> 03:33:55,890
Okay.

5049
03:33:57,170 --> 03:33:59,970
It was literally just burn immunity.

5050
03:34:00,050 --> 03:34:00,470
Okay.

5051
03:34:01,790 --> 03:34:02,370
Alright.

5052
03:34:02,750 --> 03:34:03,750
Movement speed.

5053
03:34:04,030 --> 03:34:04,610
Okay.

5054
03:34:05,090 --> 03:34:07,670
I think I'm gonna grab defense.

5055
03:34:08,970 --> 03:34:09,830
For sure.

5056
03:34:11,110 --> 03:34:13,410
I was like using it and I was like, what am I doing?

5057
03:34:13,750 --> 03:34:14,830
Like, what am I...

5058
03:34:14,830 --> 03:34:16,530
I'm just like...

5059
03:34:16,840 --> 03:34:18,690
What am I... What am I fucking doing?

5060
03:34:19,090 --> 03:34:19,430
Right now.

5061
03:34:21,410 --> 03:34:23,530
Oh, these are all the chiefs I killed.

5062
03:34:24,450 --> 03:34:25,710
I killed all of them.

5063
03:34:25,830 --> 03:34:26,530
What about the kings?

5064
03:34:26,990 --> 03:34:28,310
I killed two of the kings.

5065
03:34:28,490 --> 03:34:29,650
Oh, I killed three of the kings!

5066
03:34:32,290 --> 03:34:34,230
I killed the black wind king.

5067
03:34:36,670 --> 03:34:37,630
And then...

5068
03:34:37,630 --> 03:34:38,670
Yeah, alright.

5069
03:34:40,230 --> 03:34:40,710
Alright.

5070
03:34:40,770 --> 03:34:42,990
We go... this way.

5071
03:34:45,330 --> 03:34:45,810
Alright.

5072
03:34:47,430 --> 03:34:48,970
Bro, these guys are like...

5073
03:34:49,090 --> 03:34:49,970
So easy.

5074
03:34:54,690 --> 03:34:57,150
Okay, that's a little embarrassing, man.

5075
03:35:01,570 --> 03:35:02,170
Alright.

5076
03:35:03,430 --> 03:35:04,490
Fucking easy.

5077
03:35:05,850 --> 03:35:11,830
Bro, remember when, like, they taught me to try and use the spinny pull thing and I was like, nah.

5078
03:35:12,470 --> 03:35:14,850
I can literally just run and dodge that shit.

5079
03:35:16,890 --> 03:35:17,490
Alright.

5080
03:35:17,830 --> 03:35:18,590
Get over here.

5081
03:35:19,470 --> 03:35:20,070
Wait!

5082
03:35:20,750 --> 03:35:20,870
Wait!

5083
03:35:24,610 --> 03:35:26,270
That's friendly fire!

5084
03:35:27,730 --> 03:35:28,870
Holy shit!

5085
03:35:30,970 --> 03:35:32,170
Poor rat!

5086
03:35:33,390 --> 03:35:34,590
Holy shit!

5087
03:35:35,450 --> 03:35:36,270
That's... Wait!

5088
03:35:36,390 --> 03:35:38,550
He's also shooting this rat, too!

5089
03:35:39,650 --> 03:35:40,250
Okay.

5090
03:35:40,390 --> 03:35:40,990
Nice.

5091
03:35:41,190 --> 03:35:44,190
Okay, now that I know there's friendly fire, it's...

5092
03:35:44,810 --> 03:35:46,950
Okay, let me get rid of this rat first.

5093
03:35:47,810 --> 03:35:48,410
No.

5094
03:35:49,150 --> 03:35:51,430
And then I'll... And then I'll deal with you.

5095
03:35:51,770 --> 03:35:53,270
And I'll deal with you later.

5096
03:35:53,570 --> 03:35:55,330
I like that there's friendly fire.

5097
03:35:55,490 --> 03:35:56,790
That makes me very happy.

5098
03:35:57,630 --> 03:35:59,090
Okay, I need to figure out...

5099
03:35:59,090 --> 03:35:59,950
Alright, we fight here.

5100
03:36:01,310 --> 03:36:01,830
Okay.

5101
03:36:02,010 --> 03:36:02,650
Big baby!

5102
03:36:03,210 --> 03:36:04,070
Big baby!

5103
03:36:07,430 --> 03:36:08,430
Big baby time!

5104
03:36:13,220 --> 03:36:15,100
I think the arrow killed him!

5105
03:36:15,380 --> 03:36:16,380
Holy shit!

5106
03:36:16,460 --> 03:36:18,420
Wait, the arrow actually killed him!

5107
03:36:18,660 --> 03:36:20,060
Wait, how do I kill you?

5108
03:36:20,840 --> 03:36:22,280
Wait, that's not fair!

5109
03:36:22,700 --> 03:36:24,320
You get to live up there!

5110
03:36:24,620 --> 03:36:26,140
God fucking damn it!

5111
03:36:28,660 --> 03:36:29,100
Alright.

5112
03:36:29,800 --> 03:36:31,000
I'll deal with you later.

5113
03:36:31,140 --> 03:36:31,660
I'm gonna loot.

5114
03:36:33,180 --> 03:36:34,440
I'm gonna fucking loot.

5115
03:36:34,620 --> 03:36:35,260
I'll deal with you.

5116
03:36:35,420 --> 03:36:36,940
Oh, you think you can flank me?

5117
03:36:37,640 --> 03:36:38,740
That's fucking right.

5118
03:36:38,820 --> 03:36:39,600
No, you cannot!

5119
03:36:43,780 --> 03:36:44,680
That's fucking right.

5120
03:36:45,680 --> 03:36:46,120
Bam!

5121
03:36:47,060 --> 03:36:48,800
Oh, I am running out of stamina, though.

5122
03:36:48,920 --> 03:36:49,620
Give me a sec.

5123
03:36:49,700 --> 03:36:49,880
Oh!

5124
03:36:50,600 --> 03:36:51,940
I'm gonna throw that at me!

5125
03:36:52,880 --> 03:36:53,840
Jesus Christ!

5126
03:36:53,880 --> 03:36:54,840
You're so tanky!

5127
03:36:55,280 --> 03:36:57,380
You're literally a tank, but no damage!

5128
03:36:58,460 --> 03:36:58,920
Phew!

5129
03:37:00,460 --> 03:37:00,980
Alright.

5130
03:37:02,240 --> 03:37:03,300
Yeah, you should've.

5131
03:37:03,420 --> 03:37:05,620
You should've put more stuff on damage, like me.

5132
03:37:06,700 --> 03:37:07,440
Oh, wait!

5133
03:37:08,500 --> 03:37:09,940
Why would I use you?

5134
03:37:10,040 --> 03:37:11,440
You're literally weak as hell!

5135
03:37:15,680 --> 03:37:16,960
The wolf assassin?

5136
03:37:17,360 --> 03:37:18,460
Bro, you're literally blue!

5137
03:37:22,100 --> 03:37:23,320
You're literally blue!

5138
03:37:23,420 --> 03:37:25,300
That's the weakest spirit out there.

5139
03:37:25,600 --> 03:37:27,000
I have purple spirits.

5140
03:37:27,200 --> 03:37:28,840
What the fuck am I gonna do with you?

5141
03:37:28,960 --> 03:37:30,740
You're gonna live in my gourd, I guess.

5142
03:37:33,100 --> 03:37:33,540
Alright.

5143
03:37:33,660 --> 03:37:34,240
Let's see.

5144
03:37:36,600 --> 03:37:37,960
We gotta go this way.

5145
03:37:38,900 --> 03:37:41,500
Now we can go fucking kill these...

5146
03:37:41,500 --> 03:37:42,780
God damn it!

5147
03:37:42,800 --> 03:37:44,540
I can't even do anything to these rats!

5148
03:37:45,560 --> 03:37:46,660
This is not fair!

5149
03:37:46,880 --> 03:37:48,440
They get to live up there forever!

5150
03:37:49,100 --> 03:37:49,500
...

5151
03:37:49,500 --> 03:37:49,780
...

5152
03:37:52,620 --> 03:37:53,020
...

5153
03:37:54,240 --> 03:37:55,180
This is not fair.

5154
03:37:55,940 --> 03:37:58,020
I have to deal with these guys.

5155
03:37:58,220 --> 03:37:58,560
Oh, okay.

5156
03:37:58,740 --> 03:38:00,480
Yeah, I mean, shoot him for me.

5157
03:38:00,620 --> 03:38:01,120
Shoot him.

5158
03:38:03,140 --> 03:38:05,000
At least they're shooting him for me.

5159
03:38:06,440 --> 03:38:06,840
Okay.

5160
03:38:07,940 --> 03:38:08,680
God damn it!

5161
03:38:08,860 --> 03:38:09,560
Oh, okay.

5162
03:38:09,640 --> 03:38:10,020
Thank you.

5163
03:38:10,100 --> 03:38:10,820
Thank you, rats!

5164
03:38:11,520 --> 03:38:12,080
Thank you!

5165
03:38:13,040 --> 03:38:14,580
Wait, can my clouds kill him?

5166
03:38:17,600 --> 03:38:18,160
...

5167
03:38:18,160 --> 03:38:18,940
Guys, you lied.

5168
03:38:19,620 --> 03:38:20,180
...

5169
03:38:21,340 --> 03:38:22,380
Guys, you lied.

5170
03:38:22,740 --> 03:38:23,180
...

5171
03:38:24,680 --> 03:38:25,240
Guys.

5172
03:38:25,820 --> 03:38:28,480
Guys, my clouds can not kill him.

5173
03:38:28,660 --> 03:38:29,200
...

5174
03:38:30,220 --> 03:38:32,060
Oh, I guess you're invisib...

5175
03:38:32,060 --> 03:38:33,840
Oh, I'm so fucking stupid.

5176
03:38:34,260 --> 03:38:37,200
You wanted me to be cloud so I won't get hit.

5177
03:38:37,960 --> 03:38:40,400
Oh, I am so fucking stupid.

5178
03:38:40,440 --> 03:38:42,960
I was like... I just wanted to kill it.

5179
03:38:43,240 --> 03:38:44,560
I... I...

5180
03:38:44,580 --> 03:38:46,080
I just wanted to kill.

5181
03:38:46,440 --> 03:38:49,440
I didn't think about sneaking past it.

5182
03:38:50,880 --> 03:38:54,180
I... I didn't understand the concept of, like, sneaking?

5183
03:38:55,580 --> 03:38:56,420
Oh, shit.

5184
03:38:56,960 --> 03:38:57,740
What's that?

5185
03:38:59,300 --> 03:38:59,900
Sneaking?

5186
03:39:00,360 --> 03:39:02,160
Is that another form of killing?

5187
03:39:05,220 --> 03:39:05,820
Okay.

5188
03:39:06,940 --> 03:39:07,540
Okay.

5189
03:39:09,440 --> 03:39:12,280
Oh, thank you for getting closer.

5190
03:39:12,360 --> 03:39:13,080
Did you run out of arrows?

5191
03:39:14,580 --> 03:39:14,860
Yes.

5192
03:39:14,920 --> 03:39:16,260
Of course I choose violence.

5193
03:39:16,940 --> 03:39:17,420
...

5194
03:39:19,580 --> 03:39:20,380
Of course!

5195
03:39:21,080 --> 03:39:22,620
Why would I keep them alive?

5196
03:39:24,480 --> 03:39:25,480
Alright, up I go.

5197
03:39:26,680 --> 03:39:27,800
I can't sprint.

5198
03:39:27,980 --> 03:39:28,300
Oh, no.

5199
03:39:28,340 --> 03:39:28,940
It's because it's uphill.

5200
03:39:29,240 --> 03:39:29,480
...

5201
03:39:32,760 --> 03:39:34,000
Alright, get over here.

5202
03:39:34,820 --> 03:39:35,300
...

5203
03:39:35,300 --> 03:39:36,160
Boom!

5204
03:39:37,720 --> 03:39:38,720
That's fucking right.

5205
03:39:38,960 --> 03:39:39,760
You're next.

5206
03:39:40,760 --> 03:39:41,240
...

5207
03:39:41,240 --> 03:39:41,740
Boom!

5208
03:39:42,760 --> 03:39:43,840
That's fucking right.

5209
03:39:44,580 --> 03:39:46,000
Don't you piss me off again, wolves.

5210
03:39:46,400 --> 03:39:46,720
...

5211
03:39:47,420 --> 03:39:48,840
Alright, upgrade time!

5212
03:39:49,320 --> 03:39:50,100
Upgrade time!

5213
03:39:51,400 --> 03:39:53,080
I feel like I should get more of these.

5214
03:39:53,940 --> 03:39:55,240
Increases damage reduction.

5215
03:39:56,520 --> 03:39:57,720
Actually, yeah, I'll get that.

5216
03:39:57,980 --> 03:39:59,460
I need more stuff for my stance.

5217
03:40:05,270 --> 03:40:05,750
Alright.

5218
03:40:07,970 --> 03:40:08,450
Goodbye.

5219
03:40:09,230 --> 03:40:10,370
Is there any items here?

5220
03:40:12,230 --> 03:40:13,070
What the fuck?

5221
03:40:13,090 --> 03:40:14,430
Why is there a little cubbyhole?

5222
03:40:15,050 --> 03:40:15,530
...

5223
03:40:15,530 --> 03:40:16,850
Oh, just because I can...

5224
03:40:17,530 --> 03:40:18,090
...property damage.

5225
03:40:19,590 --> 03:40:20,230
Nice.

5226
03:40:21,630 --> 03:40:22,470
There we go.

5227
03:40:23,250 --> 03:40:23,570
Easy.

5228
03:40:24,450 --> 03:40:26,130
I love property damage.

5229
03:40:26,250 --> 03:40:26,910
Oh, thank god.

5230
03:40:27,550 --> 03:40:28,450
Thank god.

5231
03:40:28,810 --> 03:40:29,070
...

5232
03:40:31,730 --> 03:40:32,670
Incense time.

5233
03:40:33,070 --> 03:40:34,590
I still have no silk!

5234
03:40:35,250 --> 03:40:38,470
I've been trying to find silk this entire time!

5235
03:40:39,130 --> 03:40:39,690
I've been trying to find silk this entire time!

5236
03:40:39,690 --> 03:40:41,770
Where are all the silkworms?

5237
03:40:41,870 --> 03:40:42,510
...

5238
03:40:43,150 --> 03:40:43,670
...

5239
03:40:43,670 --> 03:40:45,170
I'll rest up, just in case.

5240
03:40:47,550 --> 03:40:50,410
Where the fuck are the silkworms?

5241
03:40:50,490 --> 03:40:51,010
...

5242
03:40:52,770 --> 03:40:53,810
We're literally...

5243
03:40:54,410 --> 03:40:56,750
We're literally in the birthplace of silkworms!

5244
03:40:56,750 --> 03:40:57,590
Oh, this is... oh.

5245
03:40:58,090 --> 03:40:58,610
Oh.

5246
03:41:00,590 --> 03:41:01,110
Oh.

5247
03:41:01,650 --> 03:41:04,210
Alright, let's see if I can actually buy silkworms now.

5248
03:41:04,470 --> 03:41:05,510
I can buy yarn!

5249
03:41:06,890 --> 03:41:07,410
...

5250
03:41:09,350 --> 03:41:11,970
No, I can't!

5251
03:41:12,510 --> 03:41:13,790
They just have yarn!

5252
03:41:14,290 --> 03:41:14,730
...

5253
03:41:14,730 --> 03:41:17,430
They literally only have yarn!

5254
03:41:21,920 --> 03:41:22,520
Okay.

5255
03:41:24,540 --> 03:41:25,920
I can't upgrade the bait.

5256
03:41:25,980 --> 03:41:26,640
I don't think I can.

5257
03:41:26,920 --> 03:41:27,400
Can I?

5258
03:41:28,080 --> 03:41:29,580
Baby, can you be strong?

5259
03:41:29,660 --> 03:41:30,360
I can!

5260
03:41:31,400 --> 03:41:32,360
Baby time!

5261
03:41:33,360 --> 03:41:34,440
Bro, you're blue!

5262
03:41:35,020 --> 03:41:35,380
...

5263
03:41:39,640 --> 03:41:40,840
You're literally...

5264
03:41:40,840 --> 03:41:44,640
You don't even require anything else.

5265
03:41:44,660 --> 03:41:47,280
You require will to act to level up.

5266
03:41:47,420 --> 03:41:47,580
...

5267
03:41:48,120 --> 03:41:48,460
You're fucking weak!

5268
03:41:48,760 --> 03:41:49,220
...

5269
03:41:50,640 --> 03:41:53,960
I am not giving him a chance, chat!

5270
03:41:54,320 --> 03:41:56,040
Bro, he's fucking blue!

5271
03:41:56,400 --> 03:41:58,240
What am I gonna do with blue?

5272
03:41:59,000 --> 03:41:59,300
...

5273
03:41:59,300 --> 03:41:59,700
...

5274
03:42:01,920 --> 03:42:02,240
...

5275
03:42:03,340 --> 03:42:05,680
Alright, this seems like a boss fight.

5276
03:42:06,040 --> 03:42:06,120
...

5277
03:42:06,860 --> 03:42:07,500
...

5278
03:42:08,360 --> 03:42:09,000
...

5279
03:42:09,000 --> 03:42:09,020
...

5280
03:42:09,020 --> 03:42:12,160
Out of sight, out of mind is a fool's task.

5281
03:42:12,640 --> 03:42:16,640
Seeing but seeing through is what wise men do.

5282
03:42:16,940 --> 03:42:17,500
...

5283
03:42:18,750 --> 03:42:21,280
But didn't he turn mad?

5284
03:42:21,880 --> 03:42:22,160
...

5285
03:42:22,160 --> 03:42:24,300
By what he saw, too.

5286
03:42:24,720 --> 03:42:25,160
...

5287
03:42:26,620 --> 03:42:27,580
Who's this?

5288
03:42:29,160 --> 03:42:29,940
Bear?

5289
03:42:30,540 --> 03:42:30,840
...

5290
03:42:31,800 --> 03:42:33,440
It's time to punch a bear.

5291
03:42:34,080 --> 03:42:35,400
That's fucking right.

5292
03:42:35,460 --> 03:42:35,940
I'm ready.

5293
03:42:35,940 --> 03:42:38,840
I'm fucking ready to punch a bear.

5294
03:42:39,220 --> 03:42:40,120
That's right!

5295
03:42:40,380 --> 03:42:40,680
...

5296
03:42:42,160 --> 03:42:44,000
No animal is safe!

5297
03:42:45,640 --> 03:42:47,960
No animal is safe from me!

5298
03:42:48,340 --> 03:42:48,540
...

5299
03:42:48,540 --> 03:42:50,080
Holy shit!

5300
03:42:50,280 --> 03:42:52,840
He does not do a lot of damage, guys.

5301
03:42:53,580 --> 03:42:54,240
...

5302
03:42:54,240 --> 03:42:55,500
...

5303
03:42:55,500 --> 03:42:55,860
...

5304
03:42:57,700 --> 03:42:58,360
...

5305
03:42:58,360 --> 03:42:58,380
...

5306
03:42:59,420 --> 03:43:00,220
...

5307
03:43:00,220 --> 03:43:00,840
Haha, stupid.

5308
03:43:01,500 --> 03:43:02,120
...

5309
03:43:04,560 --> 03:43:06,480
Yeah, get fucking...

5310
03:43:06,480 --> 03:43:06,720
...

5311
03:43:06,720 --> 03:43:08,340
Oh shit!

5312
03:43:08,580 --> 03:43:09,880
I did not mean to...

5313
03:43:09,880 --> 03:43:10,080
...

5314
03:43:10,080 --> 03:43:13,320
What the fuck is that suplex?

5315
03:43:13,740 --> 03:43:16,140
He fucking did a suplex, guys!

5316
03:43:16,580 --> 03:43:16,900
...

5317
03:43:16,900 --> 03:43:19,000
Holy shit, he's wrestling!

5318
03:43:19,440 --> 03:43:21,380
This bear is wrestling!

5319
03:43:21,760 --> 03:43:22,360
...

5320
03:43:22,360 --> 03:43:23,960
Oh my god!

5321
03:43:24,320 --> 03:43:24,820
...

5322
03:43:28,380 --> 03:43:28,680
He's wrestling!

5323
03:43:29,140 --> 03:43:30,900
Oh, this is the hardest one!

5324
03:43:31,120 --> 03:43:31,360
...

5325
03:43:33,280 --> 03:43:33,900
Okay.

5326
03:43:34,140 --> 03:43:34,600
...

5327
03:43:34,600 --> 03:43:39,720
Holy fuck!

5328
03:43:41,600 --> 03:43:42,900
Oh, guys!

5329
03:43:43,180 --> 03:43:46,420
This is not looking too good for me right now.

5330
03:43:46,620 --> 03:43:47,120
...

5331
03:43:47,120 --> 03:43:49,420
This is not looking too good.

5332
03:43:49,940 --> 03:43:50,560
...

5333
03:43:51,640 --> 03:43:54,680
Bro, he's actually wrestling.

5334
03:43:55,320 --> 03:43:55,940
...

5335
03:43:55,940 --> 03:43:56,240
...

5336
03:44:04,090 --> 03:44:05,570
Oh, please let me go!

5337
03:44:05,670 --> 03:44:05,970
...

5338
03:44:07,790 --> 03:44:08,830
Holy shit!

5339
03:44:09,110 --> 03:44:09,630
...

5340
03:44:14,070 --> 03:44:14,590
Boom!

5341
03:44:15,590 --> 03:44:16,590
Smack that butt!

5342
03:44:16,810 --> 03:44:18,570
That's fucking right, smack you in the ass.

5343
03:44:18,790 --> 03:44:20,550
What you gonna do about it, huh?

5344
03:44:21,370 --> 03:44:23,690
Whoa, whoa, whoa, why are you standing up?

5345
03:44:24,150 --> 03:44:24,670
...

5346
03:44:25,270 --> 03:44:26,270
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

5347
03:44:26,570 --> 03:44:26,910
...

5348
03:44:28,590 --> 03:44:30,390
Okay, that's why!

5349
03:44:30,710 --> 03:44:31,210
...

5350
03:44:31,210 --> 03:44:31,770
...

5351
03:44:33,110 --> 03:44:34,850
Okay, I get it now.

5352
03:44:34,990 --> 03:44:36,010
Whoa, shit!

5353
03:44:38,290 --> 03:44:39,370
Fuck yeah!

5354
03:44:40,410 --> 03:44:42,890
Okay, now I know for sure I'm not gonna beat him.

5355
03:44:43,050 --> 03:44:43,650
...

5356
03:44:43,650 --> 03:44:43,890
...

5357
03:44:49,410 --> 03:44:50,710
Oh my god!

5358
03:44:51,270 --> 03:44:53,750
Bro, that bear fucking...

5359
03:44:53,750 --> 03:44:53,970
...

5360
03:44:53,970 --> 03:44:56,090
He's a fucking wrestler!

5361
03:44:56,630 --> 03:44:57,230
...

5362
03:44:59,970 --> 03:45:02,750
Bear's gonna hit you with a stone cold summer.

5363
03:45:02,890 --> 03:45:03,330
...

5364
03:45:03,350 --> 03:45:05,230
I think I can... wait, you're right, I can upgrade my...

5365
03:45:05,230 --> 03:45:05,730
...

5366
03:45:06,530 --> 03:45:07,390
...my wine.

5367
03:45:07,770 --> 03:45:09,350
I remember I got the upgrade for it.

5368
03:45:09,530 --> 03:45:10,930
I almost forgot about the upgrade.

5369
03:45:11,550 --> 03:45:12,870
Wait, can I?

5370
03:45:14,130 --> 03:45:16,930
Do I have to visit the monkey guy?

5371
03:45:18,610 --> 03:45:21,110
Do I have to visit the Hong Kong monkey?

5372
03:45:21,410 --> 03:45:21,590
...

5373
03:45:21,590 --> 03:45:24,070
The British Hong Kong monkey?

5374
03:45:24,450 --> 03:45:25,650
Where is he?

5375
03:45:25,790 --> 03:45:26,930
Where does he live?

5376
03:45:27,310 --> 03:45:29,430
I don't remember where he lives.

5377
03:45:29,950 --> 03:45:30,310
...

5378
03:45:30,310 --> 03:45:32,210
It's been so long!

5379
03:45:32,730 --> 03:45:33,010
...

5380
03:45:33,670 --> 03:45:34,890
Oh, there he is!

5381
03:45:35,150 --> 03:45:36,010
Marsha, yeah!

5382
03:45:36,830 --> 03:45:37,390
...

5383
03:45:40,170 --> 03:45:41,950
I need to upgrade my wine.

5384
03:45:42,490 --> 03:45:43,930
In Hong Kong!

5385
03:45:44,270 --> 03:45:45,350
Guys, I gotta...

5386
03:45:45,350 --> 03:45:45,870
...

5387
03:45:47,570 --> 03:45:48,650
I gotta...

5388
03:45:48,650 --> 03:45:51,690
I gotta fucking find...

5389
03:45:52,250 --> 03:45:53,190
Where is it?

5390
03:45:53,230 --> 03:45:53,790
Is it this way?

5391
03:45:53,950 --> 03:45:54,550
This way, okay.

5392
03:45:58,110 --> 03:46:00,190
Alright, alright, Hong Kong monkey.

5393
03:46:00,190 --> 03:46:00,870
I'm back.

5394
03:46:02,010 --> 03:46:03,410
Do you have silk?

5395
03:46:03,830 --> 03:46:06,150
Oh, please tell me you have silk.

5396
03:46:06,370 --> 03:46:08,050
Why are you so much bigger than me?

5397
03:46:08,110 --> 03:46:08,870
Am I an adolescent?

5398
03:46:10,630 --> 03:46:11,790
Oh, thank god.

5399
03:46:12,810 --> 03:46:14,570
Oh, I finally...

5400
03:46:14,570 --> 03:46:15,950
...upgraded my stuff.

5401
03:46:16,630 --> 03:46:18,290
Wait, do you sell silk?

5402
03:46:18,470 --> 03:46:19,910
No, you sell lotus seeds.

5403
03:46:21,250 --> 03:46:21,770
...

5404
03:46:21,770 --> 03:46:21,890
...

5405
03:46:21,890 --> 03:46:22,050
...

5406
03:46:25,150 --> 03:46:27,690
What do I do with that?

5407
03:46:27,950 --> 03:46:28,350
...

5408
03:46:30,190 --> 03:46:30,550
Like...

5409
03:46:30,550 --> 03:46:31,110
...

5410
03:46:33,010 --> 03:46:34,430
Does anyone know?

5411
03:46:34,670 --> 03:46:38,110
Okay, I know the game literally just came out today, but like...

5412
03:46:38,110 --> 03:46:39,350
...is it one time use?

5413
03:46:39,750 --> 03:46:40,270
...

5414
03:46:42,170 --> 03:46:43,650
Is that one time use?

5415
03:46:43,790 --> 03:46:44,090
...

5416
03:46:44,910 --> 03:46:46,030
Oh, don't?

5417
03:46:46,550 --> 03:46:47,070
...

5418
03:46:48,950 --> 03:46:49,950
I can't tell.

5419
03:46:50,330 --> 03:46:51,730
I'm just gonna sell my gold.

5420
03:46:52,970 --> 03:46:53,490
...

5421
03:46:54,130 --> 03:46:55,310
Is there a way to max it out?

5422
03:46:55,930 --> 03:46:56,450
...

5423
03:46:56,450 --> 03:46:57,750
Oh, it is?

5424
03:46:57,990 --> 03:46:59,050
Why would we know?

5425
03:47:00,190 --> 03:47:00,690
Oh, scroll wheel.

5426
03:47:00,810 --> 03:47:01,250
Thank god.

5427
03:47:03,250 --> 03:47:03,870
Alright.

5428
03:47:04,550 --> 03:47:06,490
At least we have more heals now.

5429
03:47:07,050 --> 03:47:09,550
I still don't know where the fucking silk is!

5430
03:47:10,010 --> 03:47:10,630
...

5431
03:47:11,470 --> 03:47:13,650
I'm killing everything but bugs!

5432
03:47:14,110 --> 03:47:14,730
...

5433
03:47:19,190 --> 03:47:19,810
Okay.

5434
03:47:20,510 --> 03:47:21,130
Travel.

5435
03:47:21,910 --> 03:47:22,530
...

5436
03:47:24,730 --> 03:47:25,690
Where is it?

5437
03:47:26,330 --> 03:47:26,950
No.

5438
03:47:27,570 --> 03:47:28,450
There we go.

5439
03:47:29,630 --> 03:47:30,250
...

5440
03:47:31,170 --> 03:47:31,790
Okay.

5441
03:47:34,970 --> 03:47:35,870
Okay.

5442
03:47:37,090 --> 03:47:37,510
...

5443
03:47:37,510 --> 03:47:37,950
...

5444
03:47:37,950 --> 03:47:39,650
...

5445
03:47:41,090 --> 03:47:44,210
Let's fucking fight John Cena.

5446
03:47:44,570 --> 03:47:45,030
...

5447
03:47:46,230 --> 03:47:48,630
Let's fight Kuma from Tekken.

5448
03:47:48,770 --> 03:47:50,010
Now, I guess.

5449
03:47:50,290 --> 03:47:51,130
Hello.

5450
03:47:51,510 --> 03:47:53,730
Hello, Kuma from Tekken.

5451
03:47:55,710 --> 03:47:56,610
...

5452
03:47:56,610 --> 03:47:57,450
...

5453
03:47:57,450 --> 03:47:57,850
...

5454
03:47:57,850 --> 03:47:59,510
Baby.

5455
03:47:59,630 --> 03:48:00,050
...

5456
03:48:00,050 --> 03:48:02,230
Baby time!

5457
03:48:03,630 --> 03:48:04,810
...

5458
03:48:04,810 --> 03:48:04,950
Boom.

5459
03:48:05,390 --> 03:48:06,950
Why are you fucking running?

5460
03:48:07,050 --> 03:48:07,250
..

5461
03:48:07,250 --> 03:48:07,270
Boom.

5462
03:48:07,790 --> 03:48:08,010
...

5463
03:48:08,010 --> 03:48:08,410
...

5464
03:48:08,410 --> 03:48:09,930
...

5465
03:48:09,930 --> 03:48:10,390
...

5466
03:48:12,790 --> 03:48:14,650
Let me go.

5467
03:48:15,950 --> 03:48:17,070
Oh god.

5468
03:48:17,250 --> 03:48:18,350
Oh god.

5469
03:48:18,670 --> 03:48:19,230
...

5470
03:48:22,550 --> 03:48:24,230
Jesus Christ.

5471
03:48:24,230 --> 03:48:24,410
Alright.

5472
03:48:25,270 --> 03:48:27,550
I do so little damage.

5473
03:48:27,830 --> 03:48:30,010
Oh, fucking hell!

5474
03:48:30,370 --> 03:48:32,590
Oh, no, please!

5475
03:48:33,010 --> 03:48:34,710
I'm so sorry!

5476
03:48:38,150 --> 03:48:40,810
I'm so sorry!

5477
03:48:40,850 --> 03:48:42,770
I'm so sorry!

5478
03:48:43,590 --> 03:48:43,650
I'm so sorry!

5479
03:48:43,650 --> 03:48:46,890
I'm so sorry!

5480
03:48:47,750 --> 03:48:48,630
Okay.

5481
03:48:49,030 --> 03:48:50,350
Oh shit!

5482
03:48:50,570 --> 03:48:52,450
Don't suplex me, please!

5483
03:48:54,690 --> 03:48:57,150
How did I miss my bullet?

5484
03:48:57,270 --> 03:48:58,270
Oh, fuck!

5485
03:49:01,410 --> 03:49:03,850
Guys, I don't like fighting him.

5486
03:49:03,950 --> 03:49:05,650
I think he's...

5487
03:49:07,010 --> 03:49:09,130
He has so much HP!

5488
03:49:10,110 --> 03:49:10,150
He has so much HP!

5489
03:49:11,130 --> 03:49:12,760
He should be balanced!

5490
03:49:14,770 --> 03:49:16,250
He should be balanced!

5491
03:49:16,250 --> 03:49:16,750
Okay.

5492
03:49:17,590 --> 03:49:18,330
Alright.

5493
03:49:22,320 --> 03:49:23,360
Oh, god!

5494
03:49:23,920 --> 03:49:24,640
Oh, god!

5495
03:49:24,960 --> 03:49:25,640
Okay.

5496
03:49:27,620 --> 03:49:28,760
Oh, please!

5497
03:49:31,120 --> 03:49:31,800
Oh!

5498
03:49:31,860 --> 03:49:33,080
He slapped me!

5499
03:49:34,700 --> 03:49:36,840
Did anyone get the license on this bear?

5500
03:49:42,770 --> 03:49:43,630
Oh, god.

5501
03:49:45,050 --> 03:49:45,730
Oh!

5502
03:49:45,910 --> 03:49:46,910
Not the suplex!

5503
03:49:47,190 --> 03:49:49,250
I didn't dodge the suplex!

5504
03:49:54,450 --> 03:49:55,350
Oh, god.

5505
03:49:55,350 --> 03:49:56,790
Oh, my god.

5506
03:49:59,050 --> 03:50:00,610
Oh, please!

5507
03:50:00,870 --> 03:50:01,690
Oh!

5508
03:50:01,970 --> 03:50:03,230
He's burning!

5509
03:50:07,510 --> 03:50:09,850
That should be illegal!

5510
03:50:10,510 --> 03:50:12,150
Oh, my god!

5511
03:50:14,550 --> 03:50:15,450
Please!

5512
03:50:15,490 --> 03:50:17,410
I can't see anything!

5513
03:50:20,190 --> 03:50:22,170
What the fuck!

5514
03:50:22,390 --> 03:50:23,390
I can't...

5515
03:50:26,780 --> 03:50:28,220
Let me go!

5516
03:50:28,400 --> 03:50:29,760
Let me go!

5517
03:50:30,180 --> 03:50:30,620
Let

5518
03:50:33,900 --> 03:50:35,320
me go!

5519
03:50:35,320 --> 03:50:36,340
Guys, I don't think...

5520
03:50:36,340 --> 03:50:37,440
Guys...

5521
03:50:38,260 --> 03:50:39,820
Guys, he's too strong!

5522
03:50:41,780 --> 03:50:42,880
This bear!

5523
03:50:43,600 --> 03:50:44,840
Oh, fuck!

5524
03:50:45,980 --> 03:50:47,340
Oh, my god!

5525
03:50:48,240 --> 03:50:51,800
I can't see...

5526
03:50:51,800 --> 03:50:52,900
He has like...

5527
03:50:52,900 --> 03:50:54,420
He's literally doesn't...

5528
03:50:54,420 --> 03:50:56,760
He takes up 20% of...

5529
03:50:56,760 --> 03:50:58,700
He takes up 50% of my screen!

5530
03:50:58,700 --> 03:51:00,660
I can't see anything!

5531
03:51:01,580 --> 03:51:04,520
I actually can't see anything!

5532
03:51:09,690 --> 03:51:10,370
I actually can't see anything!

5533
03:51:10,370 --> 03:51:11,530
Oh, god!

5534
03:51:12,550 --> 03:51:12,630
Oh, god!

5535
03:51:13,350 --> 03:51:16,680
Oh, god!

5536
03:51:16,680 --> 03:51:17,360
I'm leaving.

5537
03:51:17,780 --> 03:51:18,680
Oh, no!

5538
03:51:22,580 --> 03:51:23,140
He did it!

5539
03:51:24,380 --> 03:51:27,040
Guys, he didn't want me to leave.

5540
03:51:27,240 --> 03:51:29,080
He didn't want me to leave.

5541
03:51:30,880 --> 03:51:33,240
Oh, he's so tanky!

5542
03:51:33,400 --> 03:51:35,760
I almost had wolf powers, too!

5543
03:51:36,100 --> 03:51:36,260
I almost had wolf powers, too!

5544
03:51:37,020 --> 03:51:39,220
I almost had wolf powers!

5545
03:51:39,400 --> 03:51:40,360
It was so close!

5546
03:51:41,260 --> 03:51:42,120
I mean...

5547
03:51:42,120 --> 03:51:43,000
It did happen...

5548
03:51:43,000 --> 03:51:44,820
I just couldn't use it in time.

5549
03:51:46,440 --> 03:51:47,100
Oh!

5550
03:51:47,860 --> 03:51:48,840
Goh-fucking...

5551
03:51:48,840 --> 03:51:53,420
If you upgrade the wolf...

5552
03:51:53,420 --> 03:51:54,800
You'll be able to beat him!

5553
03:51:55,240 --> 03:51:56,940
I am not going to...

5554
03:51:56,940 --> 03:51:58,800
fucking upgrade the wolf!

5555
03:51:59,620 --> 03:52:00,280
Guys...

5556
03:52:00,840 --> 03:52:01,240
Guys...

5557
03:52:01,240 --> 03:52:04,320
Yes, we are not going to upgrade the fucking wolf sword.

5558
03:52:04,320 --> 03:52:04,740
Guys,

5559
03:52:09,440 --> 03:52:11,000
the wolf is not the answer.

5560
03:52:11,220 --> 03:52:12,420
I need you to know that.

5561
03:52:16,880 --> 03:52:18,860
The wolf is not the answer, guys.

5562
03:52:18,920 --> 03:52:22,380
I know it despite how much you guys think the wolf is the answer.

5563
03:52:22,660 --> 03:52:24,800
The wolf is not the answer.

5564
03:52:26,100 --> 03:52:26,780
Oh, God.

5565
03:52:27,840 --> 03:52:28,580
Oh, God!

5566
03:52:31,720 --> 03:52:33,640
Give us the wolf, Doki!

5567
03:52:37,320 --> 03:52:39,100
I'm not giving you guys the wolf.

5568
03:52:39,260 --> 03:52:40,200
Oh, God!

5569
03:52:44,540 --> 03:52:46,060
Oh, God, please.

5570
03:52:50,920 --> 03:52:51,360
Please.

5571
03:52:53,780 --> 03:52:55,100
Oh, God, thank God.

5572
03:52:59,640 --> 03:53:00,080
Nice.

5573
03:53:03,880 --> 03:53:05,000
Let me get another... No!

5574
03:53:05,160 --> 03:53:05,860
Oh, fuck!

5575
03:53:05,880 --> 03:53:07,040
Okay, I got the dodge.

5576
03:53:08,120 --> 03:53:08,560
Okay.

5577
03:53:10,080 --> 03:53:11,540
Oh, no, not fire.

5578
03:53:11,780 --> 03:53:12,780
Not fire!

5579
03:53:14,140 --> 03:53:15,360
No, wolf.

5580
03:53:15,740 --> 03:53:16,860
What's the point?

5581
03:53:17,720 --> 03:53:19,980
The wolf is not the answer!

5582
03:53:21,320 --> 03:53:22,820
That is the point!

5583
03:53:24,020 --> 03:53:24,660
Okay.

5584
03:53:29,380 --> 03:53:30,300
Okay, nice.

5585
03:53:31,100 --> 03:53:32,940
When is the bear coming out?

5586
03:53:35,300 --> 03:53:36,180
Oh, God!

5587
03:53:36,360 --> 03:53:36,780
Oh!

5588
03:53:39,660 --> 03:53:40,480
Oh, God!

5589
03:53:41,180 --> 03:53:41,620
Shit!

5590
03:53:45,870 --> 03:53:46,500
Oh, God.

5591
03:53:46,660 --> 03:53:47,820
I need to reload.

5592
03:53:48,280 --> 03:53:49,020
Reload!

5593
03:53:50,480 --> 03:53:51,220
No!

5594
03:53:51,760 --> 03:53:53,320
What the fuck?

5595
03:53:56,160 --> 03:53:57,640
Holy shit!

5596
03:53:57,840 --> 03:53:59,320
I'm so unlucky.

5597
03:53:59,840 --> 03:54:01,320
I actually am.

5598
03:54:03,020 --> 03:54:04,140
I can't believe.

5599
03:54:09,160 --> 03:54:10,600
Oh, my God.

5600
03:54:14,550 --> 03:54:15,600
Holy shit.

5601
03:54:17,780 --> 03:54:18,900
How did this happen?

5602
03:54:19,000 --> 03:54:21,040
How did this happen to me?

5603
03:54:21,280 --> 03:54:23,340
I've made my mistakes.

5604
03:54:25,680 --> 03:54:26,340
Okay.

5605
03:54:27,420 --> 03:54:28,300
Oh, God.

5606
03:54:28,360 --> 03:54:29,840
Oh, fucking hell!

5607
03:54:34,280 --> 03:54:35,340
Come on.

5608
03:54:36,440 --> 03:54:37,680
This is not fair.

5609
03:54:39,400 --> 03:54:40,980
This is actually not fair.

5610
03:54:41,320 --> 03:54:43,780
He gets to use fire attack again?

5611
03:54:46,740 --> 03:54:47,400
Okay.

5612
03:54:50,500 --> 03:54:51,140
What?

5613
03:54:51,140 --> 03:54:52,100
That hits me?

5614
03:54:53,040 --> 03:54:54,240
Fucking bitch.

5615
03:54:56,340 --> 03:54:57,120
I'm sorry.

5616
03:54:57,200 --> 03:54:57,920
I didn't mean that.

5617
03:55:02,060 --> 03:55:03,400
I didn't mean it.

5618
03:55:03,460 --> 03:55:04,080
I'm so sorry.

5619
03:55:05,680 --> 03:55:06,800
I'm not sorry.

5620
03:55:07,160 --> 03:55:08,260
I'm not sorry.

5621
03:55:08,540 --> 03:55:09,420
I lied.

5622
03:55:09,880 --> 03:55:10,860
I lied.

5623
03:55:12,060 --> 03:55:12,900
I lied.

5624
03:55:14,780 --> 03:55:16,540
I fucking lied.

5625
03:55:18,020 --> 03:55:19,300
Oh, fire.

5626
03:55:19,560 --> 03:55:20,480
Oh, shit.

5627
03:55:24,650 --> 03:55:25,090
Okay.

5628
03:55:26,070 --> 03:55:26,510
Okay.

5629
03:55:27,370 --> 03:55:28,030
Come on.

5630
03:55:28,430 --> 03:55:30,850
I don't think I... I don't think I'm gonna get this.

5631
03:55:30,970 --> 03:55:32,570
I don't think so.

5632
03:55:32,670 --> 03:55:34,150
I'm way too weak.

5633
03:55:35,470 --> 03:55:36,170
Oh, God.

5634
03:55:39,900 --> 03:55:40,580
Oh, God.

5635
03:55:40,600 --> 03:55:40,800
No!

5636
03:55:51,060 --> 03:55:51,500
No.

5637
03:55:51,580 --> 03:55:52,540
I ran out of stamina.

5638
03:55:52,800 --> 03:55:53,440
This is bad.

5639
03:55:53,860 --> 03:55:54,860
This is so bad.

5640
03:55:55,760 --> 03:55:56,200
No!

5641
03:55:57,800 --> 03:55:58,240
Oh,

5642
03:56:04,160 --> 03:56:04,300
God.

5643
03:56:04,320 --> 03:56:04,460
No.

5644
03:56:04,580 --> 03:56:05,360
No, this is bad.

5645
03:56:06,000 --> 03:56:06,440
No!

5646
03:56:06,520 --> 03:56:09,120
He's gonna use his stupid fire attack!

5647
03:56:13,070 --> 03:56:13,630
Okay.

5648
03:56:20,900 --> 03:56:21,460
Bye.

5649
03:56:22,340 --> 03:56:23,060
Oh, God...

5650
03:56:43,820 --> 03:56:44,560
Holy shit.

5651
03:56:44,840 --> 03:56:47,380
I took a stupid fucking bear.

5652
03:56:48,220 --> 03:56:48,960
That's right.

5653
03:56:49,060 --> 03:56:50,960
I will fucking punch a bear, too.

5654
03:56:51,200 --> 03:56:52,380
I will kick a bear.

5655
03:56:54,440 --> 03:56:55,520
Where's your children?

5656
03:56:55,680 --> 03:56:58,120
I will fucking punt a cub too...

5657
03:57:02,860 --> 03:57:03,980
Holy shit!

5658
03:57:03,980 --> 03:57:04,560
Holy shit.

5659
03:57:04,600 --> 03:57:04,660
Holy shit.

5660
03:57:05,040 --> 03:57:06,180
Holy shit!

5661
03:57:06,180 --> 03:57:09,040
What do you mean you'll spare my life?

5662
03:57:20,960 --> 03:57:22,740
Wait, what's going on?

5663
03:57:26,960 --> 03:57:28,500
What the fuck happened?

5664
03:57:30,980 --> 03:57:31,740
What?

5665
03:57:42,380 --> 03:57:44,440
Oh, pardon me, young sage!

5666
03:57:44,540 --> 03:57:46,860
Mercy, young sage, have mercy!

5667
03:57:47,100 --> 03:57:47,920
That's right, peg!

5668
03:57:48,540 --> 03:57:50,700
I was just a pawn of the Celestial Court!

5669
03:57:50,940 --> 03:57:58,160
If given a choice, who dared to challenge the mighty wrecker of the Celestial Palace?

5670
03:57:59,200 --> 03:58:01,020
His words ring true.

5671
03:58:01,340 --> 03:58:07,560
No matter how daring he was, he had not the nerve to harm the great sage.

5672
03:58:09,280 --> 03:58:12,360
There must be someone else pulling all the strings.

5673
03:58:14,360 --> 03:58:15,000
Exactly!

5674
03:58:15,780 --> 03:58:17,500
And this thing is eerie!

5675
03:58:17,800 --> 03:58:21,220
I had no idea how to make use of its power!

5676
03:58:23,000 --> 03:58:29,220
Except to enshrine it up there, tricking lesser yaoguays into offerings!

5677
03:58:31,960 --> 03:58:39,620
If you pardon me, I'll go back to Guan Yin to atone for my actions and be put back on the engaging band!

5678
03:58:40,120 --> 03:58:42,360
You will never see me again!

5679
03:58:42,380 --> 03:58:43,560
I'm not out there anymore!

5680
03:58:44,480 --> 03:58:46,540
I know his nonsense!

5681
03:58:47,160 --> 03:58:48,800
Go now, little monkey.

5682
03:58:48,980 --> 03:58:52,300
Go and retrieve the great sage's relic!

5683
03:58:53,160 --> 03:58:55,040
Alright, get over here.

5684
03:58:55,200 --> 03:58:56,540
It's time to absorb.

5685
03:58:59,980 --> 03:59:00,700
Bird!

5686
03:59:06,120 --> 03:59:07,000
That's me!

5687
03:59:11,820 --> 03:59:14,400
Oh my god, what the fuck is wrong with your eyes?

5688
03:59:14,820 --> 03:59:16,320
Oh, guys!

5689
03:59:16,940 --> 03:59:18,320
It has two pupils!

5690
03:59:20,280 --> 03:59:21,160
That's not me.

5691
03:59:23,000 --> 03:59:24,440
I take it back.

5692
03:59:24,520 --> 03:59:25,220
Not me.

5693
03:59:26,240 --> 03:59:27,120
It's a freak.

5694
03:59:28,340 --> 03:59:31,480
What the fuck is wrong with this boy?

5695
03:59:32,380 --> 03:59:33,320
Okay, thank god.

5696
03:59:33,380 --> 03:59:34,740
I thought he killed the frog.

5697
03:59:35,040 --> 03:59:37,540
I thought he crushed the frog with a rock.

5698
03:59:40,440 --> 03:59:41,940
I choose bear.

5699
03:59:42,120 --> 03:59:43,940
Doki, I'll beat up a bear.

5700
03:59:44,080 --> 03:59:45,540
Rob, thank you for the super chat.

5701
03:59:45,620 --> 03:59:46,380
Thank you, thank you.

5702
03:59:46,380 --> 03:59:46,840
Oh!

5703
03:59:48,800 --> 03:59:50,480
Is that the bear I beat up?

5704
03:59:59,160 --> 04:00:01,240
He gave the child money?

5705
04:00:02,660 --> 04:00:06,740
This bear fucking beat the shit out of me and he gave the child money?

5706
04:00:09,960 --> 04:00:11,620
Why couldn't he give me money?

5707
04:00:14,780 --> 04:00:18,520
He gave the child money.

5708
04:00:19,840 --> 04:00:20,600
That's the bear.

5709
04:00:22,420 --> 04:00:22,960
Rob, don't be like that.

5710
04:00:23,400 --> 04:00:23,940
He gave the child money.

5711
04:00:24,140 --> 04:00:26,800
Rob, it's my problem.

5712
04:00:26,920 --> 04:00:27,520
Rob, you beat up a fox.

5713
04:00:28,000 --> 04:00:28,540
You beat up a fox to run away from the old dog.

5714
04:00:29,040 --> 04:00:29,960
You did it again.

5715
04:00:29,960 --> 04:00:32,720
No, I don't, because you are a monkey.

5716
04:00:32,960 --> 04:00:35,240
I didn't know that's a monkey.

5717
04:00:35,740 --> 04:00:37,400
I tried to scare him and he had no mercy.

5718
04:00:42,250 --> 04:00:43,420
Is that Sifu?

5719
04:00:58,840 --> 04:01:03,080
With the power

5720
04:01:15,680 --> 04:01:16,640
of robes.

5721
04:01:31,500 --> 04:01:32,140
Oh!

5722
04:01:32,260 --> 04:01:32,960
It's Sifu!

5723
04:01:33,020 --> 04:01:33,320
Sifu!

5724
04:01:36,440 --> 04:01:37,200
That's him!

5725
04:02:04,830 --> 04:02:06,090
Bum bum.

5726
04:02:06,490 --> 04:02:08,370
Bum bum bum.

5727
04:02:08,690 --> 04:02:10,510
Oh and then he got corrupted!

5728
04:02:14,570 --> 04:02:17,090
And then he became the bear!

5729
04:02:44,640 --> 04:02:46,320
I really like this animation.

5730
04:03:00,500 --> 04:03:02,160
Bereft of that Kasaya.

5731
04:03:03,560 --> 04:03:06,060
How shall they show the world their ties are cut?

5732
04:03:06,340 --> 04:03:08,320
And their lust is quelled?

5733
04:03:10,420 --> 04:03:13,380
I finally finished chapter one.

5734
04:03:17,340 --> 04:03:19,140
I'm fucking fine.

5735
04:03:21,120 --> 04:03:24,540
Could it be so long?

5736
04:03:29,720 --> 04:03:31,180
And the smoke blinds.

5737
04:03:31,420 --> 04:03:32,920
Stumble on the lesser.

5738
04:03:33,100 --> 04:03:33,780
Lame.

5739
04:03:34,540 --> 04:03:35,660
That's one chapter!

5740
04:03:36,280 --> 04:03:37,980
That is so much.

5741
04:03:38,060 --> 04:03:41,140
With such clumsiness, what destiny do you claim?

5742
04:03:41,680 --> 04:03:44,440
As the small fish catches its prey...

5743
04:03:44,440 --> 04:03:45,940
Tutorial done.

5744
04:03:46,860 --> 04:03:48,680
Who is the bigger fish?

5745
04:03:48,920 --> 04:03:50,220
I can't see it.

5746
04:03:50,360 --> 04:03:53,040
As for the prey and the small fish...

5747
04:03:54,340 --> 04:03:56,520
They are swimming everywhere.

5748
04:04:01,950 --> 04:04:03,170
The carving eyes.

5749
04:04:03,550 --> 04:04:04,990
Okay, there's...

5750
04:04:04,990 --> 04:04:07,650
Okay, there's five chapters because there's five relics.

5751
04:04:07,730 --> 04:04:08,530
That makes sense.

5752
04:04:12,090 --> 04:04:14,390
I'm level 22 now.

5753
04:04:14,810 --> 04:04:16,970
I feel like I'm overleveled.

5754
04:04:16,970 --> 04:04:19,090
Because of the fucking child.

5755
04:04:19,590 --> 04:04:20,430
Oh!

5756
04:04:22,170 --> 04:04:23,550
I got...

5757
04:04:23,990 --> 04:04:26,050
I finally got silk, guys!

5758
04:04:26,170 --> 04:04:27,330
I finally...

5759
04:04:28,090 --> 04:04:30,070
I finally got silk.

5760
04:04:30,750 --> 04:04:32,750
Two whole silk, everybody.

5761
04:04:33,110 --> 04:04:34,070
Two whole silk.

5762
04:04:34,090 --> 04:04:35,030
Two whole silk.

5763
04:04:36,190 --> 04:04:37,630
Holy shit.

5764
04:04:38,010 --> 04:04:38,410
Oh.

5765
04:04:40,150 --> 04:04:41,130
What's this?

5766
04:04:42,930 --> 04:04:43,290
Yi?

5767
04:04:43,630 --> 04:04:47,370
In his last life, the monk was Jin Chan Tzu.

5768
04:04:47,830 --> 04:04:50,770
The second disciple to Buddha in the West.

5769
04:04:51,230 --> 04:04:55,890
Yet his arrogance led him to disregard the Dharma teachings.

5770
04:04:56,330 --> 04:05:00,850
And as a result, the Buddha cast him down to the mortal realm.

5771
04:05:01,310 --> 04:05:04,070
He was destined to face eighty wars.

5772
04:05:04,090 --> 04:05:06,050
He won trials throughout his journey.

5773
04:05:06,230 --> 04:05:09,190
The fire for that kasiya was merely...

5774
04:05:09,190 --> 04:05:11,010
The whole two silk were fucking rich!

5775
04:05:12,230 --> 04:05:13,530
Oh, there he is.

5776
04:05:13,690 --> 04:05:14,390
The greedy man.

5777
04:05:14,870 --> 04:05:15,890
That baby?

5778
04:05:16,210 --> 04:05:17,030
Who's this?

5779
04:05:17,590 --> 04:05:22,310
A mere human, blessed with a lifespan nearing three centuries.

5780
04:05:22,750 --> 04:05:24,850
Yet he was never sated.

5781
04:05:25,150 --> 04:05:28,570
He just had to seize that one kasiya.

5782
04:05:29,250 --> 04:05:33,290
Centuries of devotion, undone by a moment's greed.

5783
04:05:33,290 --> 04:05:37,790
In the end, a lost soul became him.

5784
04:05:38,010 --> 04:05:39,370
How pathetic.

5785
04:05:39,870 --> 04:05:40,550
Poor guy.

5786
04:05:43,430 --> 04:05:44,750
Just don't be greedy.

5787
04:05:46,070 --> 04:05:46,770
Oh, what's this?

5788
04:05:48,570 --> 04:05:51,550
A fine guardian for Guan Yin.

5789
04:05:51,590 --> 04:05:52,950
Am I gonna beat that guy up too?

5790
04:05:53,270 --> 04:05:56,690
And he came back here to daydream immortality.

5791
04:05:57,410 --> 04:06:04,920
Sadly, he had the greed, but lacked his followers, but not himself.

5792
04:06:04,920 --> 04:06:08,940
His destiny was sealed the moment he donned...

5793
04:06:08,940 --> 04:06:09,580
Oh, that's the bear!

5794
04:06:11,440 --> 04:06:12,400
That's the bear!

5795
04:06:12,960 --> 04:06:14,620
That's the bear, I did beat him up!

5796
04:06:14,780 --> 04:06:15,840
Fuck yeah, you deserve that.

5797
04:06:18,220 --> 04:06:18,900
That's him!

5798
04:06:19,300 --> 04:06:20,460
I did beat him up!

5799
04:06:21,000 --> 04:06:21,560
Okay.

5800
04:06:24,800 --> 04:06:26,320
Oh my god.

5801
04:06:27,160 --> 04:06:28,380
What a chapter.

5802
04:06:28,820 --> 04:06:29,780
Can I look at my inventory?

5803
04:06:30,700 --> 04:06:33,380
A glimpse reveals the foe's might.

5804
04:06:33,480 --> 04:06:34,900
A talent tilts to an unknown.

5805
04:06:34,900 --> 04:06:35,420
An unfair fight.

5806
04:06:37,340 --> 04:06:38,860
Hold to awaken.

5807
04:06:39,140 --> 04:06:39,900
Considerability increases.

5808
04:06:40,160 --> 04:06:41,480
Oh, I had to pick between.

5809
04:06:43,040 --> 04:06:45,620
The cooldown on the spell is massively reduced.

5810
04:06:46,040 --> 04:06:46,960
Considerability increases.

5811
04:06:47,080 --> 04:06:48,800
Focus gain upon consecutive.

5812
04:06:49,240 --> 04:06:50,560
I feel like...

5813
04:06:53,660 --> 04:06:55,180
Is focus mana?

5814
04:06:55,600 --> 04:06:56,440
Or the...

5815
04:06:56,440 --> 04:06:58,960
Focus is the critical...

5816
04:06:58,960 --> 04:07:00,580
The right click, right?

5817
04:07:02,100 --> 04:07:04,500
I feel like I should get the critical hit damage.

5818
04:07:05,360 --> 04:07:06,100
Focus is...

5819
04:07:06,100 --> 04:07:07,240
Yeah, I'm gonna get critical hit.

5820
04:07:08,780 --> 04:07:09,580
Uh...

5821
04:07:10,780 --> 04:07:11,580
Alright.

5822
04:07:12,360 --> 04:07:13,960
Alright, my little freak.

5823
04:07:14,840 --> 04:07:15,740
What's this?

5824
04:07:15,840 --> 04:07:16,560
Transformation?

5825
04:07:22,020 --> 04:07:25,280
Each talent level increases might recovery speed.

5826
04:07:29,680 --> 04:07:30,860
What is...

5827
04:07:30,860 --> 04:07:34,260
Is transformation the baby or the...

5828
04:07:34,260 --> 04:07:35,780
Uh...

5829
04:07:36,600 --> 04:07:39,020
Is that the baby or the...

5830
04:07:39,020 --> 04:07:39,920
Uh...

5831
04:07:39,920 --> 04:07:40,520
The wolf.

5832
04:07:45,060 --> 04:07:45,660
Wolf?

5833
04:07:46,080 --> 04:07:46,680
Okay.

5834
04:07:47,080 --> 04:07:47,680
Um...

5835
04:07:47,680 --> 04:07:49,480
I'm gonna save two...

5836
04:07:49,480 --> 04:07:50,600
Uh...

5837
04:07:50,600 --> 04:07:52,340
Might recovery speed.

5838
04:07:52,880 --> 04:07:54,000
I might get this then.

5839
04:07:54,920 --> 04:07:56,860
I'm gonna grab the might recovery speed.

5840
04:07:58,060 --> 04:08:00,160
I don't really like cloud step.

5841
04:08:01,220 --> 04:08:03,840
I feel like I'd rather save it for the lock.

5842
04:08:04,080 --> 04:08:05,220
The lock seems like...

5843
04:08:05,220 --> 04:08:06,060
Stronger.

5844
04:08:06,760 --> 04:08:07,620
Cause like...

5845
04:08:07,620 --> 04:08:09,400
It takes mana away and I...

5846
04:08:09,400 --> 04:08:11,900
I can't waste that at all.

5847
04:08:11,900 --> 04:08:13,240
I feel like...

5848
04:08:13,900 --> 04:08:15,060
I feel like...

5849
04:08:15,060 --> 04:08:16,920
Like I don't wanna waste my mana.

5850
04:08:17,820 --> 04:08:19,600
Is there like any good?

5851
04:08:21,100 --> 04:08:21,780
Reduces...

5852
04:08:21,780 --> 04:08:22,460
Wait...

5853
04:08:22,460 --> 04:08:23,520
What do you mean?

5854
04:08:23,560 --> 04:08:26,160
Massively reduces stamina cost when in water?

5855
04:08:27,100 --> 04:08:28,620
Wait a minute...

5856
04:08:28,620 --> 04:08:30,560
Am I gonna be swimming?

5857
04:08:31,060 --> 04:08:31,940
Am I...

5858
04:08:33,820 --> 04:08:35,100
Wait a minute...

5859
04:08:35,420 --> 04:08:37,700
What is this foreshadowing right here?

5860
04:08:38,240 --> 04:08:38,600
Wait...

5861
04:08:38,600 --> 04:08:39,800
No...

5862
04:08:39,800 --> 04:08:40,540
No...

5863
04:08:41,220 --> 04:08:42,620
What is this foreshadowing?

5864
04:08:45,000 --> 04:08:46,420
Let's be ready.

5865
04:08:46,740 --> 04:08:48,720
But I don't wanna swim.

5866
04:08:50,860 --> 04:08:51,460
No...

5867
04:08:51,460 --> 04:08:53,160
Not the water levels.

5868
04:08:54,020 --> 04:08:54,620
No...

5869
04:08:55,820 --> 04:08:56,420
Okay.

5870
04:08:56,480 --> 04:08:57,400
Black Bear Gwaii.

5871
04:08:57,640 --> 04:08:58,240
Alright.

5872
04:08:58,300 --> 04:08:58,760
This is the...

5873
04:08:58,760 --> 04:08:59,200
Here.

5874
04:08:59,220 --> 04:08:59,780
Guy I killed.

5875
04:09:00,660 --> 04:09:02,000
Keeper of the Black Wind.

5876
04:09:02,680 --> 04:09:03,280
Uh...

5877
04:09:04,220 --> 04:09:05,120
Black Wind.

5878
04:09:05,480 --> 04:09:06,240
That's him.

5879
04:09:08,200 --> 04:09:08,800
Alright.

5880
04:09:08,980 --> 04:09:10,040
Let's look at the intro.

5881
04:09:10,140 --> 04:09:10,520
For the next one.

5882
04:09:10,520 --> 04:09:11,080
For the next chapter.

5883
04:09:12,020 --> 04:09:12,660
Yes.

5884
04:09:16,410 --> 04:09:17,050
Please.

5885
04:09:17,410 --> 04:09:18,410
Yellow sand.

5886
04:09:18,910 --> 04:09:20,170
That is sand!

5887
04:09:20,410 --> 04:09:21,510
We're back in sand land!

5888
04:09:28,940 --> 04:09:29,580
Right?

5889
04:09:31,580 --> 04:09:32,480
It's loading!

5890
04:09:32,680 --> 04:09:34,140
That's why I'm lagging beer.

5891
04:09:34,240 --> 04:09:35,940
That's why I'm fucking lagging!

5892
04:09:38,840 --> 04:09:40,160
I wanna see the...

5893
04:09:40,160 --> 04:09:41,900
The intro for chapter 2.

5894
04:09:42,120 --> 04:09:42,660
Guys.

5895
04:09:42,780 --> 04:09:44,600
I really like this game.

5896
04:09:44,760 --> 04:09:45,140
Guys.

5897
04:09:45,380 --> 04:09:46,500
I think like...

5898
04:09:46,500 --> 04:09:47,740
You know on Saturday we were up here and it was like...

5899
04:09:53,480 --> 04:09:56,000
You know Saturday we're supposed to have God of War?

5900
04:09:56,320 --> 04:09:58,380
I think we'll swap it to Wukong.

5901
04:09:58,700 --> 04:10:00,100
This game has been really fun.

5902
04:10:04,620 --> 04:10:07,540
Now I don't know why it just got really good reviews.

5903
04:10:20,870 --> 04:10:21,890
Where's your head?

5904
04:10:26,310 --> 04:10:27,350
What the fuck?

5905
04:10:27,510 --> 04:10:28,150
How are you singing?

5906
04:10:32,610 --> 04:10:34,050
No head?

5907
04:10:35,390 --> 04:10:36,630
What the fuck?

5908
04:10:57,320 --> 04:10:58,440
He's Irish?

5909
04:11:04,950 --> 04:11:07,420
I like how he made him Irish.

5910
04:11:08,760 --> 04:11:10,260
How did I get here?

5911
04:11:11,080 --> 04:11:12,660
Oh wait is that Scottish?

5912
04:11:12,900 --> 04:11:13,660
Is he Scottish?

5913
04:11:21,850 --> 04:11:26,870
Yeah the fact that it was like Chinese and then he started becoming Scottish.

5914
04:11:29,870 --> 04:11:30,430
HAHAHAHAHA

5915
04:11:33,750 --> 04:11:36,150
This is so fucking weird.

5916
04:11:37,470 --> 04:11:39,590
He started speaking Scottish.

5917
04:11:44,370 --> 04:11:45,430
Alright got her.

5918
04:11:48,050 --> 04:11:50,950
I might have taken... oh no.

5919
04:11:51,730 --> 04:11:53,690
Wait a minute this is water.

5920
04:11:54,070 --> 04:11:55,090
Give me a sec guys.

5921
04:11:55,310 --> 04:11:57,750
I know you want to shoot your arrows but I'm trying to loot here.

5922
04:12:01,810 --> 04:12:06,190
Guys I know you really want to shoot me guys but give me a... where are these?

5923
04:12:06,330 --> 04:12:06,890
Are they rats?

5924
04:12:07,130 --> 04:12:08,150
Or are they wolves?

5925
04:12:09,410 --> 04:12:10,190
They're rats.

5926
04:12:10,990 --> 04:12:12,390
That's a giant ass rat.

5927
04:12:12,970 --> 04:12:14,430
Wait you're fucking weak.

5928
04:12:15,890 --> 04:12:17,350
Okay give me a sec bro.

5929
04:12:18,410 --> 04:12:19,970
Rat guy give me a sec.

5930
04:12:23,830 --> 04:12:24,970
That's fucking right.

5931
04:12:26,150 --> 04:12:27,930
What are you doing in the desert rat?

5932
04:12:29,990 --> 04:12:30,330
Alright.

5933
04:12:31,270 --> 04:12:32,490
He's a rat soldier.

5934
04:12:32,710 --> 04:12:33,750
Oh I'm going to be killing rats.

5935
04:12:34,890 --> 04:12:35,810
Rats rats rats.

5936
04:12:36,150 --> 04:12:37,570
We are the rats.

5937
04:12:38,410 --> 04:12:40,910
Alright we're going to be killing... oh no.

5938
04:12:41,730 --> 04:12:42,710
Oh no.

5939
04:12:43,010 --> 04:12:44,670
Wait the desert is worse.

5940
04:12:45,390 --> 04:12:49,270
I don't know... wait there's... there's so...

5941
04:12:49,270 --> 04:12:50,650
Where do I go?

5942
04:12:51,770 --> 04:12:54,230
This is... this is worse.

5943
04:12:55,130 --> 04:12:56,550
I'm so confused.

5944
04:12:56,990 --> 04:12:58,030
There's too many.

5945
04:12:58,030 --> 04:12:59,830
There's too many pathways.

5946
04:13:01,530 --> 04:13:02,530
Where do I go?

5947
04:13:03,990 --> 04:13:04,890
Where am I?

5948
04:13:05,330 --> 04:13:06,490
I'm already lost.

5949
04:13:07,570 --> 04:13:08,650
Where do I go?

5950
04:13:10,710 --> 04:13:12,190
Which is the pathway?

5951
04:13:13,010 --> 04:13:13,650
Am I?

5952
04:13:13,770 --> 04:13:15,170
Is this the... is this...

5953
04:13:15,170 --> 04:13:16,350
Oh there's the incense.

5954
04:13:16,590 --> 04:13:16,890
Okay.

5955
04:13:18,090 --> 04:13:18,610
Alright.

5956
04:13:20,010 --> 04:13:21,010
Give me a sec.

5957
04:13:21,130 --> 04:13:21,730
Give me a sec.

5958
04:13:21,750 --> 04:13:23,050
I'm going to charge up my attack.

5959
04:13:24,190 --> 04:13:24,710
Boom.

5960
04:13:25,650 --> 04:13:26,270
That's right.

5961
04:13:26,970 --> 04:13:27,570
Easy.

5962
04:13:28,210 --> 04:13:28,810
Alright.

5963
04:13:28,950 --> 04:13:31,630
Yeah I'm way too tired to navigate the desert.

5964
04:13:31,990 --> 04:13:33,730
I'm just like...

5965
04:13:34,150 --> 04:13:34,950
This is fucked.

5966
04:13:35,110 --> 04:13:36,290
I cannot...

5967
04:13:36,290 --> 04:13:39,030
I cannot navigate this.

5968
04:13:41,290 --> 04:13:42,830
We're going to call it here.

5969
04:13:45,950 --> 04:13:47,110
Oh my god.

5970
04:13:47,170 --> 04:13:48,130
That was so fun.

5971
04:13:48,770 --> 04:13:50,350
Oh I didn't have two streams tomorrow.

5972
04:13:50,490 --> 04:13:51,670
I'd play longer.

5973
04:13:52,130 --> 04:13:55,890
I definitely would play a lot longer if I didn't have two streams today.

5974
04:13:56,270 --> 04:13:57,150
Um...

5975
04:13:58,030 --> 04:13:58,650
Not today.

5976
04:13:58,730 --> 04:13:58,990
Tomorrow.

5977
04:13:59,790 --> 04:14:00,430
Um...

5978
04:14:00,430 --> 04:14:01,550
But I...

5979
04:14:02,270 --> 04:14:04,030
Really enjoy this game.

5980
04:14:04,330 --> 04:14:05,190
Not gonna lie.

5981
04:14:05,550 --> 04:14:10,090
I really, really like this game so far.

5982
04:14:10,530 --> 04:14:12,670
I think like...

5983
04:14:13,270 --> 04:14:13,890
Uh...

5984
04:14:13,890 --> 04:14:14,430
Um...

5985
04:14:14,430 --> 04:14:19,710
I think the reviews were definitely right when they said that the gameplay has been really fun.

5986
04:14:20,130 --> 04:14:24,450
And I do enjoy the character designs, the environment, the music.

5987
04:14:24,630 --> 04:14:25,770
And like...

5988
04:14:25,770 --> 04:14:45,070
Uh, the story is like, I think you have to read Journey to the West to understand the story a little bit because like, um, the story, I feel like, I think it's mostly hidden in the lore aspect, like the, the guide itself, like, um, and like, I feel like you have to have,

5989
04:14:45,130 --> 04:14:55,750
uh, you have to have like background knowledge of Journey to the West to sort of understand, uh, the story and, uh, like where it's heading and stuff.

5990
04:14:55,770 --> 04:15:01,890
Like that, because I still, like, I still don't know who the fuck I am.

5991
04:15:02,090 --> 04:15:07,430
Like, no, I know who I am, but like the character himself is very, like, he's like, what's going on?

5992
04:15:07,630 --> 04:15:14,670
Because we haven't really, we haven't really freed Wukong, like actual, we haven't got our memories back yet.

5993
04:15:14,770 --> 04:15:18,170
So we're like just this random monkey that's just traveling around.

5994
04:15:18,570 --> 04:15:23,590
Um, so like, we still haven't discovered who we really are yet.

5995
04:15:23,750 --> 04:15:31,310
So that's like, basically, the gist of it, because we're like, our memory, we're like, uh, we're just like traveling.

5996
04:15:31,390 --> 04:15:32,290
We'll be like, what the fuck?

5997
04:15:32,310 --> 04:15:36,090
Why are you, why are you trying to, uh, why are you trying to kill me?

5998
04:15:36,150 --> 04:15:37,070
I'm just a regular monkey.

5999
04:15:37,410 --> 04:15:41,950
But then we're all like, and then, but then all the enemies were like, you're not just a regular monkey.

6000
04:15:42,290 --> 04:15:43,090
You're special.

6001
04:15:43,610 --> 04:15:46,110
And then I'm just like, but I just want banana.

6002
04:15:46,630 --> 04:15:46,950
No.

6003
04:15:53,190 --> 04:15:55,330
Um, but yes, I'm just a lost monkey.

6004
04:15:55,770 --> 04:16:02,490
Uh, but yes, uh, the story itself, I think you definitely do need to know background knowledge of Journey to the West, understand what's going on and everything.

6005
04:16:02,670 --> 04:16:04,950
And, uh, it's been fun though.

6006
04:16:05,030 --> 04:16:06,190
I've been enjoying it a lot.

6007
04:16:06,430 --> 04:16:14,430
I think like killing that giant ass fucking baby made me a better player because I, everything else has been a lot easier now.

6008
04:16:14,650 --> 04:16:24,930
Like all the other enemies have been a lot easier after going through the fucking bullshit and the 200,000 moves that the blue baby had.

6009
04:16:25,770 --> 04:16:28,630
Um, the other enemies have like three combos.

6010
04:16:28,890 --> 04:16:32,590
That fucking baby had like 200,000 different combos.

6011
04:16:32,770 --> 04:16:33,510
He can clap.

6012
04:16:33,650 --> 04:16:34,330
He can jump.

6013
04:16:34,430 --> 04:16:35,710
He can fucking headbutt.

6014
04:16:35,810 --> 04:16:37,290
He has the Kamehameha.

6015
04:16:37,490 --> 04:16:38,970
He has the force blast.

6016
04:16:39,110 --> 04:16:39,850
He had everything.

6017
04:16:40,070 --> 04:16:40,910
It was bullshit.

6018
04:16:41,010 --> 04:16:42,090
That was actually bullshit.

6019
04:16:46,470 --> 04:16:49,550
But I hope you guys enjoy this stream tomorrow.

6020
04:16:49,650 --> 04:16:51,910
I will be on Twitch for a morning stream.

6021
04:16:52,070 --> 04:16:53,850
Uh, today, the games gone watch the long.

6022
04:16:54,010 --> 04:16:55,630
And then after that, we will be.

6023
04:16:55,770 --> 04:16:57,110
Checking out the new Overwatch update.

6024
04:16:57,490 --> 04:17:04,950
On Saturday, I'm going to change God of War to Wukong because I honestly really want to play Wukong.

6025
04:17:05,250 --> 04:17:08,390
I just really want to play Wukong.
