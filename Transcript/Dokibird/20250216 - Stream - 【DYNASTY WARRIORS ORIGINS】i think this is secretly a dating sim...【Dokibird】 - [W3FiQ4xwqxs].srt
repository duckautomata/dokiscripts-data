00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,600
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,340
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,040
My God, I feel like...

4
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,640
It's... oh my God, it's fine.

5
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,020
I don't know, I'm just really out of it.

6
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,480
It's so early in the morning as well.

7
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,320
It's like, what do you feel, Doki?

8
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,840
Please tell... I don't know anymore.

9
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,040
I don't know what to feel anymore, guys.

10
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,720
I don't know.

11
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,540
Oh my God.

12
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,880
I need to let you guys know that...

13
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,540
I still have yet to unpack my bags.

14
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,840
You know, since Japan...

15
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:35,520
My suitcase is still all packed up in the corner of my entrance.

16
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,180
I literally just pushed my suitcase in the corner of...

17
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,920
You know, in the corner of my entrance.

18
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,340
And then I was like, I'll get to you tomorrow.

19
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,720
And then I do that every day.

20
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,580
Every day I walk Doki Amber Doge, I look at my suitcase and I'll be like...

21
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,360
Don't worry, tomorrow would be the right time.

22
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,400
But, starting tomorrow.

23
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,200
Start not today, sorry.

24
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,020
No, starting today!

25
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,620
You know what?

26
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:05,820
No.

27
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,520
Starting today!

28
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,720
Because I'm doing a livestream there.

29
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,780
And that's a deadbolt.

30
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,620
Thank you for the superchat.

31
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,240
Thank you, thank you.

32
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,420
Welcome back to Ikemen Warriors Origin Fujoki Bird.

33
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,800
Thank you for the superchat.

34
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,720
Thank you, thank you.

35
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,820
Starting today, I will be so much more productive.

36
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,940
We are going back to the productive Doki Bird days.

37
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,740
No, no, we're not gonna go on vacation or anything.

38
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,780
We're gonna go back to the grind.

39
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,800
We're gonna organize stuff again.

40
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,480
Starting today, I will unpack my suitcase tomorrow.

41
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,400
For sure, this time, tomorrow.

42
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,900
I will be a peak productivity Doki Bird.

43
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,160
For sure, for real, guys.

44
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,680
Starting today.

45
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,900
Tomorrow, I'm unpacking my suitcase.

46
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,380
Also, did you guys know that they finally discovered who Jack the Ripper was?

47
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,240
And his name is Aaron.

48
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,840
As I was looking on Twitter, people were like, Why is no one freaking out about this?

49
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,140
We have finally discovered who Jack the Ripper was.

50
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,500
And his name is Aaron.

51
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,560
Yeah, apparently.

52
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,320
Apparently, via like DNA testing.

53
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,580
Well, I'll show you guys the Twitter article I was reading.

54
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,860
By the way, it's on Vice, by the way.

55
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,860
He's like apparently some fucking barber or something.

56
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,960
It's not, was never a doctor.

57
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,480
It was just a barber from Poland.

58
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,520
But, sorry, Aaron.

59
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,740
Sorry, I meant to say Aaron.

60
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,940
But yes, that is apparently who Jack the Ripper was.

61
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,820
So now, like, you know.

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,660
Now it's cool, I feel like.

63
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,720
I feel like, you know, knowing he's just a barber from Poland.

64
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,060
Now that's like, also he died in a mental asylum.

65
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,560
So it's like, oh, he was just crazy, you know.

66
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,400
There wasn't like some fucking doctor that was practicing or whatever.

67
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,680
He's just crazy.

68
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,620
It's just, it's not so cool anymore.

69
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,140
The mystery of it was like, he was never cool.

70
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,880
Say that to the millions of films and TV shows.

71
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,720
And women be like, oh, Jack the Ripper.

72
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,720
Oh, if you were alive right now, I'd let you murder me.

73
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,420
So like, Sweeney Todd.

74
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,400
No, Sweeney Todd's cooler because like, he made them into pies.

75
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,660
Oh, you think I'm wrong?

76
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,340
Look at the women that send like, mail over to like, you know.

77
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,420
People who are at death sentence.

78
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,640
Prisoners and women sending fan mail to them.

79
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,920
Be like, oh, I can fix you.

80
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,100
If you ever get out of prison, I'd marry you in a heartbeat.

81
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,640
You're so hot.

82
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,740
Oh my god.

83
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,740
Anyway, so...

84
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,240
So yeah, no, she's not as cool.

85
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,420
I don't know, it just ruined Jack the Ripper for me.

86
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,080
I thought he was like...

87
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:43,560
The mystery behind him was just much more interesting than finding out that his name is A-A-Ron.

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,060
I don't know.

89
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,820
The mystery is just, I'd rather it be like, unknown.

90
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,820
Yeah, reality is often very disappointing.

91
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:02,340
I'd rather it be like, unknown for the rest of my life than finding out that his name was A-A-Ron.

92
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,600
For those that don't follow me on Twitter!

93
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,360
For those that don't follow me on Twitter.

94
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,320
And I'm sorry if you weren't invited to the exclusive Doki Amber Doge birthday party.

95
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,040
I'm very sorry, guys.

96
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,460
Look, the list was very exclusive.

97
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,120
And, um, she just didn't pick you!

98
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,900
Except for one lucky dragoon.

99
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,900
One lucky dragoon was able to come to the party.

100
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,480
But I have, I think this is like, my favorite photo I've ever taken of him for this year.

101
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,780
Because, uh, so like, when I was at the dog bakery, they had a cowboy hat.

102
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,300
And I was like, I need it.

103
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:53,540
And I love, I love, I love his side eye.

104
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,150
Howdy, partner.

105
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,470
This town ain't big enough for the two of us.

106
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:16,410
I think the side eye has to be one of my favorite, like, photos I've ever taken of him.

107
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,410
And then here's him, here's that one lucky dragoon.

108
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:27,550
The one lucky dragoon that, uh, got an invitation to the party.

109
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,030
You guys!

110
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:31,970
There you guys are!

111
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:32,470
Look!

112
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,830
See?

113
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,210
That's you over there!

114
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,030
Yes, you!

115
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,590
You got invited to the party!

116
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:38,810
Congratulations!

117
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,250
Yeah!

118
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,650
It's the dragoon!

119
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,870
Um, so that's the one lucky dragoon that got invited to the party.

120
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,470
And then here's like, here's the, uh, birthday cake too.

121
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,490
Um, we're joking.

122
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,310
Also, here's like a piece of chicken.

123
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,650
Chicken toy right there.

124
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,050
I spent $200.

125
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,630
Here's him eating his cake.

126
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,570
He's like, yum, yum, yum.

127
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,090
It should've been me!

128
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,850
Like, thank you for the superchat.

129
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,130
Thank you, thank you.

130
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,930
So, here's him eating his cake.

131
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,910
Yum, yum, yum.

132
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,990
$200 Canadian dollars.

133
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,070
No, it's not just the cake.

134
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,070
Not just the cake.

135
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:31,170
It was also the cowboy hat, the little, um, the dragoon plushie, the little, um, uh, the chicken toy.

136
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:38,310
And I also bought two extra treats, like a burger-shaped treat, and then also like a chicken drumstick-shaped treat.

137
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,210
And, um, I also bought him a little birthday hat too, but he did not like the birthday hat.

138
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:50,230
He really liked, for some reason, he was okay with the cowboy hat, but he did not like the birthday hat.

139
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,130
I tried to put the birthday hat on him, then he's like, no.

140
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,550
Mother, why would you do this to me?

141
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,550
But yeah, he was not happy with that.

142
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,550
But at least I got...

143
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,910
At least I got, uh...

144
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,950
At least I got the cowboy hat, though.

145
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,110
The cowboy hat made him feel so cool.

146
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,410
Honestly, I'm not gonna lie, like, valid.

147
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,850
Very, very valid.

148
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,210
But starting today, I'm gonna be so much productive.

149
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,330
I'm gonna get everything, not everything done, I'm gonna get some things done today.

150
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,310
And then, um...

151
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,610
And then I'm, uh...

152
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,370
I'm gonna unpack my suitcase tomorrow.

153
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,790
We're gonna be back on track.

154
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,110
This week was more so of, like...

155
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,010
I know, like, I just got, like, I was like, oh, this week is where I'm gonna get things back on track.

156
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,510
But this week was more so of, like, I went to sleep.

157
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:54,130
I spent most of my days just catching up on sleep.

158
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,690
I finished sleep, and then I was like, sleep time!

159
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,110
And I would be like, it's the next day.

160
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,710
And I'm like, oh, God.

161
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,950
That's... oh, no.

162
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,210
Oh, no.

163
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,770
This week is my week, for real, for real.

164
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:15,850
A liar.

165
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,990
No, my manager is not happy.

166
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,010
He is...

167
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,630
He's not happy!

168
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,850
He's like, where are you?!

169
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,410
And I'd be like, sorry.

170
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,110
I'm sorry, I just woke up.

171
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,710
And then, like, I did, like, a morning call today.

172
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,770
Like, you know, when I woke up, I was...

173
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,770
Cause, like, to catch up on work, cause I was not there yesterday night.

174
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,910
I was...

175
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,850
I was...

176
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,330
I was not there.

177
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,650
I was not alive.

178
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,030
And then, cause, like, after the very exclusive...

179
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,030
I mean, I was partying with my dog!

180
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,390
Okay, guys?

181
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,770
I was partying with my dog, okay?

182
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,850
Like, my very exclusive...

183
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,110
It was a great...

184
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,070
You guys should have been there for the exclusive musical guest, guys.

185
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,230
Oh, my God.

186
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,650
Like, I can't say who it was that was there.

187
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,810
DJing for Dad's party, because, like, I signed an NDA.

188
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,710
But, oh, man.

189
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,750
You should have been...

190
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,070
Oh, I wish you guys were invited, guys.

191
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,630
I...

192
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,370
And to the lucky Dragoon that was there.

193
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:23,610
That got to see who the exclusive musical guest was.

194
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,970
You signed an NDA, too, so you can't reveal it as well.

195
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,670
Anyway.

196
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,290
But, yes.

197
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:39,470
And then, like, I called my manager to get, like, here's the update on what y'all have to do.

198
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,250
And what I haven't been doing.

199
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,390
And, like, what I need to, you know.

200
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,210
And then, they were like, did you walk Doki Amber Doge yet?

201
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,830
And I looked at my clock, and it was, like, 15 minutes till stream start.

202
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,410
And I was like, oh, fuck!

203
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,630
And then my manager was like...

204
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,930
I'll update you tomorrow.

205
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,490
Or tonight, then.

206
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,150
So yeah, anyway.

207
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,810
I fed him before I got the call, though.

208
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,490
But, yes, anyway, so don't worry.

209
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,870
Like, I said, today...

210
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,830
Today's where productivity goes up.

211
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:30,630
Today.

212
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:31,890
That's it.

213
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:36,610
And to kick things off, we do a long stream.

214
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,040
Today is where things are different!

215
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Today is that day!

216
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,000
Gee, who would've thought?

217
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,540
Today is the day where we have a long stream.

218
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,980
And it's not because of my rivals.

219
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,240
Today is that day!

220
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,560
Don't worry, trust in me, guys.

221
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,980
I need you guys to trust in me or it's not gonna work, okay?

222
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,060
With the power of belief, we can make sure that today is that day.

223
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,000
We do not stop until we hit at least three to four hours, guys.

224
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
That's the goal.

225
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,500
Anyway, we are back with Dynasty Warriors Origin.

226
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,680
We weren't able to continue last time because I think I was sick or something.

227
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,440
I don't know.

228
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,920
I feel like my body has been breaking down a lot.

229
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,820
That's why I needed more rest lately.

230
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,120
But today is that day where we're gonna play a long time.

231
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,120
We stopped at the perfect moment where Guan Yun was like...

232
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,780
He was like, why don't you come into this tent in more ways than one?

233
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,600
And I was just like...

234
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,340
And then it faded to black and I was like...

235
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,580
What just happened?

236
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,720
I was just like...

237
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,240
What just happened?

238
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,180
Where did I go?

239
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,520
Where did I go?

240
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,220
Apparently, I was reading, I was watching a clip.

241
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,540
And people were saying like...

242
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,420
Oh man, no.

243
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,420
It's just...

244
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,980
Because they're like, oh, maybe it's just the English translation.

245
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,460
People were just getting a little too spicy.

246
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,280
But like, people were saying like...

247
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:53,440
Oh yeah, the Japanese translation to all of that is just as bad.

248
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,900
If not, like, yeah.

249
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,300
And I was like, how?

250
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,600
And also the Chinese translation too, apparently.

251
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,040
The Japanese and the Chinese dialogue is like, very similar.

252
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,620
So I was like, oh.

253
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,640
So like, it's just a game.

254
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,280
It's just...

255
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,180
It's just how they do it, apparently.

256
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,100
It's the direction of the game.

257
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,860
So like, yeah, okay.

258
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,360
So now I know that...

259
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,320
Now I know where we're heading to.

260
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,320
AP93, thank you for the super chat.

261
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,260
Thank you, thank you.

262
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,180
Your very first super chat too.

263
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,100
Thank you so much.

264
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:38,940
Hi Toki.

265
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,260
It's my birthday today.

266
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,560
2024 was great, especially because I discovered you one year ago these days.

267
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,600
Cheers to an even better 2025.

268
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,060
Thank you, thank you for the super chat, AP.

269
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,060
Happy birthday to you.

270
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,940
Happy birthday to you.

271
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,260
Happy birthday, dear AP93.

272
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,340
Happy birthday to you.

273
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,680
Yeah, happy birthday!

274
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,060
Okay, wait, is that...

275
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,220
Oh, I thought that says Beijing.

276
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,240
And I was like, what?

277
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,560
There was a Beijing?

278
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,260
Back then?

279
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,820
I was like, that can't be right.

280
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,680
No, but...

281
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,060
I just can't read.

282
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,260
It's alright.

283
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,860
It's the story of my life.

284
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,940
I need to start selling some of these things.

285
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,120
Some of these are like, not great.

286
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,020
We'll get rid of this.

287
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,340
We have the general sword anyway.

288
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,560
So we'll get rid of all these guys.

289
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,260
I feel like none of these matters anyway.

290
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,460
Alright, get rid of the fists.

291
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,260
Oh, my fists are not that strong.

292
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,400
I really want to use blade and hoops, but like...

293
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,680
They're trash.

294
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,480
The DPS is trash.

295
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,700
Guys, I found...

296
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,800
I know I said this before, but like...

297
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,180
This game is 25 plus hours long.

298
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,160
So we're gonna be here for a while.

299
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,720
We're gonna...

300
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,500
We're gonna be here for a little bit, guys.

301
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:01,370
Alright.

302
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,190
Hello, Zhongfei.

303
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,810
Your brother tried to do stuff.

304
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,690
I don't know what happened, but like...

305
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,390
I blacked out.

306
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,090
Oh, not Doki.

307
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,470
Sounds like you've been busy lately.

308
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,910
But don't let your victories go to your head.

309
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,250
Get too comfortable, you might find yourself caught off guard.

310
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,070
Let me teach you a special trick of mine.

311
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,390
Keep your head on your shoulders and use it well.

312
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,450
I don't think Zhongfei was known to keep his head on his shoulders.

313
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,880
Zhongfei was definitely not known for that.

314
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:33,860
Not gonna lie.

315
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,920
Alright, let's see.

316
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,920
We gotta go...

317
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,100
I'm sorry, I love that.

318
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,640
These are like nothing, right?

319
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,380
These are just XP farm.

320
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,700
So I don't have to do any of these.

321
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,440
Oh, wait.

322
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,600
I need to unlock this.

323
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,160
Oh!

324
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,120
A maple horse?

325
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,200
Goodbye, horse.

326
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,970
I have a new friend now.

327
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,560
Goodbye.

328
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,220
You know what they say about horse meat, guys?

329
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,040
What do they say, Doki?

330
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,360
I don't know, ask Ikea.

331
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,620
No!

332
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,340
I don't wanna!

333
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,020
I don't even care, dude.

334
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,000
Oh my gosh, how else am I gonna see the funny people in my room?

335
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,620
Oh my god, I was getting drugged!

336
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,640
He's buying incense from this one guy?

337
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,840
This one mysterious guy that somehow disappeared?

338
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,660
Guys, I don't think this incense...

339
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,700
I knew it.

340
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,300
I knew I was getting fucking drugged by this innkeeper.

341
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,260
You have any leaves?

342
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,060
Yeah, this dealer!

343
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,060
I gotta find this fucking dealer right now.

344
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,280
I fucking knew it.

345
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,900
That's why I keep seeing this fucking child in my room.

346
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,460
I'm like, who is this child?

347
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,720
Where is his parents?

348
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,880
I stopped using the incense and Doki disappeared.

349
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,380
I fucking knew it.

350
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,700
Oh yeah, I forgot, left Doki.

351
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,960
Alright, give me a sec, it's been a while.

352
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,060
Goodbye, right Doki.

353
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,640
Hello, still right Doki.

354
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,300
Still right Doki.

355
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,480
Where did I put left Doki?

356
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,600
Oh, center Doki.

357
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,360
Doki from around the border.

358
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,500
Wait, oh there we go.

359
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,360
Doki from around the world.

360
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,620
Okay, we gotta find his dealer.

361
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,900
Also, how's the sound?

362
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,340
It's been a while since we looked into the sound.

363
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,860
So I hope everything is okay.

364
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,740
Okay, we gotta go.

365
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,280
It's over there.

366
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,520
There's where his dealer is.

367
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,120
It's right in this corner.

368
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,130
Hello.

369
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,940
The innkeeper sent me.

370
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,000
For some quote unquote incense.

371
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,210
Incense?

372
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,130
Oh, there's my sister.

373
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,130
You see the child too?

374
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,550
That's some strong shit.

375
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,210
Oh, she does not see the child.

376
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,150
Okay, nevermind.

377
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,610
Oh wait, you do!

378
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:14,810
Oh my god.

379
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:17,570
She's...

380
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,790
Or they're not real?

381
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,430
Wait, is she fake too?

382
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,330
She's not real?

383
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,450
Hello?

384
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,510
Little girl or little boy?

385
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,850
I can't tell you.

386
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,590
It's very hard to tell.

387
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,610
You're all just beautiful.

388
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,430
Okay, little boy.

389
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,070
How do you know?

390
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,630
Are you looking for her herbs?

391
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,550
Wait, are you the dealer?

392
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,430
Oh no, okay.

393
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,730
I'm definitely getting high.

394
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,130
Yeah, these visions.

395
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,050
Okay.

396
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,750
Oh yeah.

397
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,970
No, the innkeeper was joking me up.

398
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:28,170
Yeah, I was definitely getting drugged in the inn.

399
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,510
Oh my god.

400
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,490
I was sleeping to that incense too.

401
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,590
It's all out, so it's not good.

402
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,830
That is not good.

403
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,450
No wonder I was actually...

404
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,790
I was seeing things.

405
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,230
What's the accident faction you think Doki would choose?

406
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,250
The correct answer is Cao Cao.

407
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,970
Thank you for the super chat.

408
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:48,950
Thank you, thank you.

409
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:49,950
Thank you.

410
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,750
Was this, you went to your home?

411
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,410
I think it might have been, yeah.

412
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,730
I don't know, I'm giving vague fucking choices.

413
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,490
It was either I don't know or I maybe.

414
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,770
I don't think the incense is...

415
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,810
is helping too.

416
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,310
What can I do to remember?

417
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,690
I might or might not know.

418
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,870
Why is this little boy fucking dealing with drugs?

419
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,410
I had to hazard a guess.

420
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:29,930
I'd say that you are suffering from some kind of formless malady.

421
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,810
And finding a cure for such a thing is beyond my current abilities.

422
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:41,170
This is quite humiliating and intriguing.

423
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,750
Would you mind if I traveled with you for a while until I find a cure?

424
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,670
I wish I could stop seeing people.

425
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,530
I can treat you if you are injured.

426
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,770
You're a doctor?

427
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,690
How old are you?

428
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,190
When did you get your...

429
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,330
I don't mind.

430
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:56,950
Why?

431
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,570
Do I just die and fight him?

432
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,590
Wait, does...

433
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,450
What if I just say no?

434
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,970
Like, where did you get your degree?

435
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,890
You're so young!

436
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,550
No, I don't want a child to be my doctor.

437
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,610
I...

438
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,250
What if I have...

439
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:28,170
What if I get an arrow through my fucking chest and then the little boy...

440
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:28,650
Wait, what?

441
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,890
Did he just invited himself?

442
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,770
He just invited himself.

443
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,410
I said no.

444
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,490
What if an arrow goes through my chest and then he was like, don't worry, smell this incense.

445
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,410
My name is...

446
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,370
Well, you can call me Yuan Hua.

447
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,650
Yuan Hua.

448
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,990
I am a surgeon.

449
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,830
Oh my god.

450
00:25:59,250 --> 00:25:59,530
Alright.

451
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,330
Okay, accomplished a mission.

452
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,250
I don't know how.

453
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:04,530
I just talked to a guy.

454
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,570
Oh wait.

455
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,990
Vanquishing the bandits?

456
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,630
I don't remember if these are...

457
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,570
Do these actually grant me anything?

458
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:13,510
I don't remember.

459
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,750
Oh, it does.

460
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,150
Okay.

461
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,890
Yeah, the people grant me stuff.

462
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,440
I can't believe it.

463
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,200
Okay, I need to remember how to play this game, guys.

464
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,740
Guys, I need to remember how to play this game because I definitely do not.

465
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,480
Okay.

466
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,860
There's only two buttons.

467
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,500
Not gonna lie.

468
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,020
Nevermind.

469
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
I can remember.

470
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,840
There's literally only two buttons to remember.

471
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,140
Okay, technically three buttons to remember.

472
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,480
Okay, get over here.

473
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,600
What I do remember is that they're all tall.

474
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,520
They're all bigger than me.

475
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,880
I am a short king.

476
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,880
Here to represent all the short kings.

477
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,000
That's right.

478
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,720
No more diverse... wait, actually yes, diversity higher because they're all just tall people.

479
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,580
Allow short people to become generals!

480
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,500
We have feelings too!

481
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,180
We're just as good as the tall people.

482
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,840
We're just as good as you.

483
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,800
That's right.

484
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,400
That's right.

485
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,120
Can a tall person do this?

486
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,260
Okay, there you go.

487
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,740
Jesus, how many fucking officers are there?

488
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:38,920
Exactly.

489
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,280
If you guys didn't know, Chow Chow is also a short king too.

490
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,600
How tall is he?

491
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,820
He's like incredibly short.

492
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,240
And look at that, he beat them all.

493
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,980
Okay, where's the last...

494
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,740
Okay, there he is.

495
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,500
Okay.

496
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,720
He was five foot one?!

497
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,700
Holy shit, he was fucking composite!

498
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:09,280
I like how the game made him so fucking tall compared to

499
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,260
like...

500
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:13,980
There he is.

501
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,820
I want to make sure...

502
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,260
Nice.

503
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,540
Jesus Christ, this guy is Wait, they still exist?

504
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,680
The yellow turban generals?

505
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:26,780
Oh shit.

506
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,200
Oh fuck, I forgot to do the RB fist.

507
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,800
I can't believe it!

508
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,600
I'm technically taller than him!

509
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,040
Oh my god!

510
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,560
He is the shortest of all short kings.

511
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,660
He is the role model to us all.

512
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,180
Oh nice, my proficiency increased.

513
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,380
I didn't even...

514
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,740
Oh shit, what?!

515
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,240
Okay, that should have...

516
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,940
Oh fuck.

517
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,840
Oh no, this is bad.

518
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,780
Jesus Christ, this guy is so strong.

519
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,140
I think this is the strongest one.

520
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,140
Nice.

521
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,840
Yay, I did it!

522
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,440
I did it!

523
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,100
No!

524
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,700
Yeah, this is mine now.

525
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,640
I own you.

526
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,840
Alright, nice.

527
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,120
Okay, I'm not gonna use the wheel though, because...

528
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,520
What's this?

529
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,800
Deliver a single slash and then move back quickly.

530
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,100
Okay.

531
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,600
Nice.

532
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,680
Bro forced you into this state with a funny instance, yet can't fix you from it.

533
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,020
Thank you for the super chat, Darkblade.

534
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,240
Thank you, thank you.

535
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,850
Is there like...

536
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,340
Ye olde Dynasty Rehab?

537
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,800
Guys, I'm a little worried now for my guy.

538
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,480
He's been sleeping with the incense for a very, very long time.

539
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,800
I'm a little bit worried for my guy right now.

540
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,940
I don't think he's okay anymore.

541
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,840
Thank you for the super chat.

542
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Thank you, thank you.

543
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,020
Alright, here you go.

544
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,600
I found your dealer.

545
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,680
Thank you, my esteemed guest.

546
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,700
You're the one who found the herb- oh yes.

547
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,280
We call him the herb seller.

548
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,080
Yes.

549
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,680
Now I won't have to worry about running- You're still gonna put that in my room?!

550
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,640
He literally told you that it causes visions!

551
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,560
And you're gonna put it in my room?!

552
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:39,880
Still?!

553
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,160
Oh yes, you have received another letter from a distinguished individual.

554
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,440
I left it in your room.

555
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,240
Please find a moment to read it later.

556
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,940
Like, excuse me?!

557
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,600
Are we done?

558
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,820
You're still gonna- Oh, it's fucked.

559
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,140
It's actually fucked.

560
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,040
Okay.

561
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,340
Okay.

562
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,040
Oh, it just goes automatically.

563
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,800
Okay, nevermind.

564
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,000
I thought it gives me a choice.

565
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,340
Alright, I didn't win one.

566
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,440
This will be fast anyway, right?

567
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,140
Oh shit, oh shit!

568
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:08,700
Whoops!

569
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,420
Whoops!

570
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,760
I sorta missed.

571
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,860
That's okay.

572
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,680
These will be fast, don't worry.

573
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,000
This will be really fast.

574
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,500
Oh, I didn't wanna do this one.

575
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,340
I feel like these ones are, like, useless.

576
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,280
I can't believe it won't let me, like, pick.

577
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,400
Click double confirm.

578
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,080
Get out of here.

579
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,420
You don't matter.

580
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,720
You're just little guys.

581
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,560
You don't matter.

582
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,460
I'm here for the big boy.

583
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,800
The biggest of boys.

584
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,020
Where are they?

585
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,300
Where are the biggest of boys?

586
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,060
Oh, there they are.

587
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,940
Holy shit!

588
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,800
He's so big!

589
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,060
Alright, good.

590
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,100
Okay, oh shit.

591
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:53,960
It's fine.

592
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,160
I deflected it.

593
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,180
That's fine.

594
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,500
I didn't deflect that very well, but that's okay.

595
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,700
I deflected it.

596
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,660
Oh my god, these guys are such a waste of time.

597
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,940
You don't matter.

598
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,980
You don't even have a name.

599
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,300
You're literally a just-caught bandit chief.

600
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,920
Come on, get up.

601
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,200
Oh, I completed the training.

602
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,560
Nice.

603
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,620
Okay.

604
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,160
Come on, get out!

605
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,480
Get out!

606
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,040
Get out here!

607
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,320
You no-name man!

608
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,680
Okay, nice.

609
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,500
Oh shit, not nice.

610
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,060
Okay.

611
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,940
Oh shit, nice.

612
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,800
Alright, yay!

613
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,800
Yay!

614
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,120
That's right!

615
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,960
I'm gonna dance on your grave.

616
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,800
Oh, I do.

617
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,260
Nice.

618
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,180
Okay, I need that actually.

619
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,540
I need skill points to upgrade my man.

620
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,000
Okay, those are- I just need to talk to the people.

621
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:13,500
The people are the ones that give me stuff, but I want to see who sent me a letter.

622
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,920
Oh my god.

623
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,340
Yo, dragons.

624
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,160
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

625
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,160
Thank you, thank you.

626
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,140
Fun fact, it took 21 years for the Yellow Turban Rebellion to end completely.

627
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,600
He's just gonna live in my room like that?

628
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,740
Bro, take off your shoes.

629
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,280
Fucking rude!

630
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,100
That's so rude.

631
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:41,440
That's so rude.

632
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,280
He doesn't even take off his shoes!

633
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,240
He's like- Oh my god, I already hate him.

634
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,960
The disrespect.

635
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,680
Alright.

636
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,880
Oh, I got two.

637
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,120
Two guys sent me letters.

638
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,120
To all who fight for peace.

639
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,300
Lian province is in turmoil.

640
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,260
Han Sui has joined the invading Qi'an forces in rebelling against the Emperor.

641
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,440
All who fight for peace are ordered to gather in Lian.

642
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,840
Join the government forces led by General Dong Zhuo to rid the land of this festering evil.

643
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,440
Rise for the Emperor!

644
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,280
Rise for peace!

645
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,240
Oh, nice.

646
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:20,560
Okay.

647
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,300
And then I have a letter from...

648
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,340
Route A- Route Z, I think.

649
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:33,780
Dear Natoki, I hope you have been in good health since the decisive battle against the Yellow Turbans.

650
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,920
I'm writing to you for one reason alone.

651
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,400
I need your help to put some rebels in their place.

652
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,720
I'll tell you more when we meet.

653
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:50,160
If you're willing to lend us your strength, please, make the journey to Changsha in Jing province.

654
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,800
Oh, he wants me, guys.

655
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,840
Guys, I'm in.

656
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,960
Guys, I'm gonna add another guy to my collection.

657
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,520
Another general to my collection.

658
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,040
And then I'm bringing a third guy with me.

659
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,000
Alright.

660
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,100
Let's get this item real quick, though.

661
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,680
Recommended level.

662
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,680
Oh, I'm level 12.

663
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,500
I should be fine.

664
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,800
I get a horn.

665
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,380
Gah!

666
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,720
Alright.

667
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,820
How many generals are we collecting?

668
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,600
I don't even know anymore.

669
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,400
I...

670
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,980
I don't...

671
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:44,400
I don't even know how many generals I have anymore.

672
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,120
How the fuck do I...

673
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,220
Oh, it's this area.

674
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,800
The world where I... Guys, remember this area?

675
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,180
Where I got incredibly lost?

676
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,620
You guys remember that?

677
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:55,800
Hahaha.

678
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,320
Where you apparently have to use your fucking horse to get over there?

679
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,380
Okay.

680
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,820
I gotta go this way.

681
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,120
Okay, how do I get up?

682
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,820
Oh, it's over there.

683
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,480
Oh, there's a ramp over here.

684
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,580
Wait, reinforcements?

685
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,920
Excuse me?

686
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,320
What do you mean reinforcements?

687
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:21,880
You...

688
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,720
How do you slap people?

689
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,420
The rebellion!

690
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,680
I killed your leader!

691
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,180
He was so hot though.

692
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,880
I understand why you would...

693
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:36,620
I feel like a lot of cult leaders, like the requirement to become a cult leader is just to be hot.

694
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:37,920
Like...

695
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,100
Hahaha.

696
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,260
I feel like that's like a majority of like cult leaders.

697
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:47,300
They just gotta be like hot and like very charismatic.

698
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,880
So it makes you wanna like donate hundreds and thousands of dollars.

699
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,500
Anyway guys, thank you so much for...

700
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:54,900
Hahaha.

701
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,460
Hahaha.

702
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,620
Hahaha.

703
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,180
Haha.

704
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:12,980
I feel like streamers can technically become cult leaders.

705
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,320
Um, if like we can use our powers.

706
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,420
Like, I feel like... Okay, not gonna lie.

707
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,780
I feel like... Okay.

708
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,380
I feel like it's very easy for streamers to become a cult leader.

709
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,340
But like...

710
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,220
But also like, that's so much work.

711
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,100
Like...

712
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,800
No, no, no.

713
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,540
We're not cult.

714
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,240
My mission is to create an actual religion.

715
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,160
Hahaha.

716
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,380
Why be a cult when I can be a registered religion for tax breaks?

717
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,580
Um...

718
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:49,820
Okay.

719
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,720
Are we not done?

720
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,360
Where's D?

721
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,820
Where is D?

722
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,560
The fuck?

723
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,620
Oh, it's over there.

724
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,340
The advisor.

725
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,740
Oh my god, it's the nerd that still lives?

726
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,120
Alright, nice.

727
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,040
Alright, get out of here, nerd.

728
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,300
Get out of here.

729
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,000
I'm gonna stuff you in the goddamn locker.

730
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,380
Get over here.

731
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,580
That's right.

732
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,780
Locker time for you, nerd.

733
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,500
For tax reasons, we are a religion.

734
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,180
Duck, thank you for the superchat.

735
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
Thank you, thank you.

736
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,860
Rising, thank you for the superchat.

737
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,620
Thank you, thank you.

738
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,760
Ah yes, I'm a doctor.

739
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,500
Let me stay with you for free room and food and I'll totally take care of you.

740
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,340
By the way, this doctor was the one that started all of this too.

741
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,100
Wait, there's more?

742
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,780
How many fucking people are there?

743
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,860
How do I get out of here?

744
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,080
Okay.

745
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,520
Get my horse here.

746
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,980
Get my maple horse here.

747
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,120
Alright, cheer.

748
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,540
Cheer up.

749
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:58,980
Dash.

750
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,440
Come on.

751
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,400
Get over here.

752
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,120
Wait.

753
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,740
Sorry, I forgot where RB was.

754
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,880
I was pressing every button because I forgot.

755
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,400
Right button is where RB was.

756
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,280
I was literally pressing everything but right button.

757
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,420
I was like, oh, it's the left side, right?

758
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,900
That's what right button means.

759
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,820
It's on the left.

760
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,760
Juan George, thank you for the superchat.

761
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,680
Thank you, thank you.

762
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,620
No, no, no.

763
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,700
No, no, no, no, no, no.

764
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,740
We're gonna aim to be a registered religion.

765
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,880
I just need a place to worship.

766
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,100
That's really it.

767
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,640
That's the one thing that's holding me back.

768
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,260
Come on.

769
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,100
Get- Oh, shit.

770
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,440
It's fine.

771
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,560
Jesus Christ, he's huge.

772
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,240
It doesn't matter.

773
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,680
Fucking rise up.

774
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,400
Nice.

775
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,060
Oh my god, why is he so fucking tanky though?

776
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,140
Jesus Christ.

777
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,640
He's just so tanky.

778
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,040
You're like an- You're literally an NPC.

779
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,500
How are you so tanky?

780
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,440
I don't understand.

781
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,720
Alright, get out of here.

782
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,980
Get out of here.

783
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,040
That's- Oh, shit.

784
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,860
That's fucking right.

785
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,280
Leave.

786
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:29,580
Leave.

787
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,080
Oh, shit.

788
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,900
Oh, fuck.

789
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,200
Oh!

790
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,760
Whoops.

791
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,980
Didn't realize he was in the middle of an ult there.

792
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,780
Yeah, it'd be very awkward if I died to an NPC and it wasn't even Lu Bu in the end.

793
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,280
Also, I'm scared.

794
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,060
I'm really scared to fight Lu Bu.

795
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,880
It feels like this game is a lot harder now.

796
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,900
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

797
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,640
Thank you, thank you.

798
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,060
We're not a cult, by the way.

799
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,920
Thank you for the super chat.

800
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,780
Thank you, thank you.

801
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,680
Rozin, thank you for the super chat.

802
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,460
Thank you, thank you.

803
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:02,900
What do you mean?

804
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,120
This is definitely not a cult where I spend lots of money.

805
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,060
Wait.

806
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,700
Thank you for the super chat.

807
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,800
Thank you, thank you.

808
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,920
Gus, thank you for the magenta sofa.

809
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,240
Thank you, thank you.

810
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,700
The church of the blood god is not a cult.

811
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:17,600
Exactly!

812
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,860
As long as you have the church of something, it can't be a cult.

813
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,460
Thank you for the magenta sofa.

814
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,000
Thank you, thank you.

815
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,040
Restores 10% when victory has been achieved in an ally.

816
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,220
Wait, that's good.

817
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,120
Right?

818
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,660
Okay, boost health by 20%.

819
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,320
Boost health by 3%.

820
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,720
Restores health.

821
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,220
I feel like I rather just have boost health by 20%.

822
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,040
I'll just have that for now.

823
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,880
I'm gonna go all the way back.

824
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,920
Wait, what's that?

825
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,200
Oh, it's just my house.

826
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:00,980
Okay.

827
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,360
Wait, I have two areas.

828
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,040
I have two areas to go to.

829
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,440
Oh my god, they're offering me stuff!

830
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,040
Oh my god, Birch?!

831
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,760
Okay, who's Birch?

832
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,760
I'm sorry, I'm done playing with you now.

833
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,120
Now my horse is even cooler.

834
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:24,760
Okay, do I wanna do Huang Gai or Dong Zhuo?

835
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,440
I'll go this way.

836
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:28,960
Let's go this way.

837
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,280
Oh, weapon shop.

838
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,120
Is it better?

839
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,420
No.

840
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,940
Wait, what's better?

841
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:40,920
No, it's the same.

842
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,540
Okay, I already have... Wait, what?

843
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,060
Three, three?

844
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,460
Yeah, they're all the same.

845
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:50,780
You're welcome.

846
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,140
Is there more stuff here?

847
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,370
Oh, they're literally all the same.

848
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:58,870
Wait, no.

849
00:42:59,070 --> 00:42:59,890
This is new.

850
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,690
The battle gauntlets rank 80.

851
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,030
Because...

852
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,670
Oh my god, I'm broke though.

853
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,230
I'm so poor.

854
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,650
I can't buy it.

855
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,110
I'm too poor.

856
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:12,350
What's this?

857
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,050
Suppression of the end.

858
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,630
Oh no, this is the Dong Zhuo!

859
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,050
The Dong Zhuo level.

860
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:21,470
Okay, let's unlock this fast travel.

861
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,370
Wait, Birch is the best horse before post-game?

862
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,950
Just keep it equipped and level up?

863
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,630
But what about the red hair?

864
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:31,970
Can I not...

865
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,670
Can I not...

866
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,050
Can I not kidnap...

867
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,490
Lu Bu's horse?

868
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:42,730
That can't be.

869
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,550
Shouldn't the red hair be even stronger?

870
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,630
Oh, red hair is post-game?

871
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:50,870
I can't believe it.

872
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,250
What is the fucking horse gonna do when I kill his master?

873
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,670
Is he just gonna retire?

874
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,340
I'm gonna kill him anyway.

875
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,340
Let me fucking steal the horse.

876
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,440
Oh,

877
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,340
Guan Yun gets it.

878
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,260
It'll be a shame if he loses his head.

879
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,900
Don't worry.

880
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,100
This weapon is sharp enough to cut somebody's head off.

881
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,060
I'm listening.

882
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,920
He's like, listen.

883
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,620
I'm like, waiting.

884
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,260
I'm like, okay.

885
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,300
When does he start talking?

886
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:18,430
I'm eating my snack.

887
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,730
You need only to obey my orders.

888
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,290
Ignore anything Zhang Wei says.

889
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:26,970
If I die, nobody will be sending out orders and that will lead to a catastrophe.

890
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,570
Remember that.

891
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,790
Doki is too lazy to be a cult leader?

892
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,970
I just feel like...

893
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,150
It's so much work.

894
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,050
I don't know.

895
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:50,450
It just feels like more work than it should be.

896
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:53,390
We'll start by attacking the enemy's headquarters.

897
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:56,810
If I could delegate being a cult leader, maybe I'll give it.

898
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,310
I don't mind being the face of it.

899
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:13,810
If I can delegate parts of it.

900
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,930
I wonder if that's how pyramid schemes work.

901
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:20,710
I mean, that's basically it.

902
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:24,570
I'd rather start a pyramid scheme than a cult.

903
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,510
Because that's where you can delegate it to people more.

904
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:30,030
It's practically a cult.

905
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:31,270
What should I do?

906
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:33,890
You're more useful that way.

907
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,350
Oh, I can do whatever the fuck I want.

908
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:39,850
I feel like you earn more in a pyramid scheme too.

909
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:43,590
If you're the head of the pyramid scheme, because all the money goes back to you.

910
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,310
It's practically just the same.

911
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,790
It's practically just the same as a cult.

912
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:57,110
Except it's not a registered religion, so you don't get tax breaks, which is a downside.

913
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:02,490
Being in a pyramid scheme versus being a cult.

914
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:06,310
Wait, are some cults registered religions?

915
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:11,670
Cults that are registered religions.

916
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:15,110
Guys, this is all hypothetical, by the way.

917
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:16,490
Oh yeah, Scientology is.

918
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,250
I forgot.

919
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,790
Scientology is a registered religion.

920
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:28,430
I feel like if I was ever to start a cult...

921
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:31,170
What the fuck is Church of Universal and Triumph?

922
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:32,630
The fuck is that?

923
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,510
Founded in the United States in 1975.

924
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:38,450
I don't think that...

925
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:43,550
If a religion was found in 1975, I don't know if that's a natural religion.

926
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:49,050
Don't look it up.

927
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,790
I just think...

928
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:54,030
I just think it's weird that...

929
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:57,590
I'm not gonna talk about Scientology.

930
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:58,490
I'm a little...

931
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:00,430
Too many...

932
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,450
The thing I'm like, really...

933
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:06,450
I don't know how they do it, but they have celebrities in Scientology.

934
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,590
How the fuck did they do that?

935
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:09,590
That's actually crazy.

936
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:13,910
If I were to ever start a registered religion, I hope it goes... I'm sorry.

937
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:14,410
I...

938
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,250
I hope...

939
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:24,130
I hope it's just as good as Scientology.

940
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:34,950
Doki, please.

941
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,530
Doki, no.

942
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:42,590
The Family International.

943
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,110
Why are they all found in the 70s?

944
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:49,370
The Family International is founded in 1968.

945
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:51,930
What the fuck?

946
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,070
What is their lore?

947
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,290
What is...

948
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:00,450
Okay, so apparently, we already all like founded in 1955.

949
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:03,190
19... Wait.

950
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:06,270
Oh no, that's the one where they all drink the Kool-Aid.

951
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:10,550
Okay, 1974, 1955, 1968.

952
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:13,350
Oh man, the 70s were fucking weird.

953
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:16,470
The 70s were fucking weird.

954
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:18,630
Oh my god.

955
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,470
What the fuck was going on in the 70s?

956
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:23,410
What?

957
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:31,490
Born too late to create a successful cult god.

958
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:32,950
Damn it.

959
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:34,890
Thank you for the super chat.

960
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:37,590
Yeah, I was looking up like...

961
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:42,030
Cults that are registered religions and like...

962
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:43,270
Let's see.

963
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:46,010
And it's like...

964
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:47,530
1, 2, 3...

965
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:48,670
Wait, Mormonism?

966
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:51,370
I'm not touching that.

967
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:54,890
I'm not touching that.

968
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:55,610
I'm not touching that.

969
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:57,590
Wait, why is Mormonism...

970
00:49:58,330 --> 00:49:59,990
Is it...

971
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:01,050
Okay.

972
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:05,590
Anyway, 1, 2, 3...

973
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,890
Oh.

974
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:17,930
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6 out of like...

975
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:29,190
3, 6, 6 out of the 9 things, the 9 searches, cults, quote unquote cults, started in the 70s.

976
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:30,930
That registered religion.

977
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,350
Like, the fuck?

978
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:33,870
So many choices.

979
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,810
So many choices.

980
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:39,550
Oh my god.

981
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:40,850
Which one to choose?

982
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,550
God damn it, I was born too late to be...

983
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:47,450
To get on the craze, the cult craze.

984
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:54,710
Blazing, thank you for the super chat.

985
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:55,590
Thank you, thank you.

986
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:58,150
Do we get a special quote later when we join the cult?

987
00:50:58,490 --> 00:50:59,230
Thank you for the super chat.

988
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,190
Thank you, thank you.

989
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:01,270
Simple minded.

990
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:02,710
Oh yeah, right, right.

991
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,170
Thank you for the super chat.

992
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:05,150
Thank you, thank you.

993
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:07,350
GloryCrosses, thank you for the AkaSupa.

994
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:08,530
Thank you, thank you.

995
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:12,690
Can I bribe, I mean donate to secure a leadership position?

996
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:14,650
Thank you for the AkaSupa.

997
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:16,070
Thank you, thank you.

998
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:17,190
Alright.

999
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:20,670
Oh, this is like pay to win.

1000
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:21,950
Pay to become a leader.

1001
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:24,710
Pay to become a... What is it called?

1002
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:30,410
Like, the thing about cults is that they have like weird fucking names for their positions.

1003
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:33,850
What was like the name for like the Scientology leader?

1004
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:38,030
We'll go to the bottom left.

1005
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:42,950
Pay to win cult simulator.

1006
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:48,070
I know there was like the Grand Wizard, right?

1007
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:49,130
No, that's a different thing.

1008
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:50,090
No, it was not.

1009
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:56,070
Was it actually the Grand Wizard?

1010
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:58,210
Oh my god.

1011
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,370
No, that's a different thing.

1012
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,090
No, that is... I'm sorry.

1013
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,370
That is absolutely...

1014
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,690
No, that's something else.

1015
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,470
Okay, but what was the...

1016
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:09,230
Oh, please Scientologist, I'm sorry.

1017
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:10,910
I confused your positions.

1018
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:12,070
I'm so sorry.

1019
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,950
Please, please Scientologist lawyers, please.

1020
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:27,530
Wait, so like...

1021
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:30,230
So like, what were the positions...

1022
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,310
What was the leader called in Scientology?

1023
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:36,570
Okay, we'll get this guy.

1024
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,550
They use codenames?

1025
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:43,110
What were they called?

1026
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:43,930
Oh shit.

1027
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,390
They were just called a Scientist?

1028
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:48,610
What degree do they have?

1029
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:52,030
Are they legally allowed to call themselves Scientists?

1030
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:57,430
Oh shit.

1031
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:00,110
I'm trying my best.

1032
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,190
I'm literally trying my best to defend this camp.

1033
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:05,870
What do you mean?

1034
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:07,130
I'm literally here!

1035
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:12,090
Jesus Christ.

1036
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:14,510
Oh my god.

1037
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:15,710
Jesus Christ.

1038
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:16,750
You know what?

1039
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:17,250
You're right.

1040
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:21,150
He's right.

1041
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,330
Why am I saving them?

1042
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,930
They have their own navy?

1043
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:28,230
Oh my god.

1044
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:31,410
I want to buy sea land.

1045
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:37,690
Sorry, I was like thinking...

1046
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:39,250
You guys said they have their own navy?

1047
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:43,430
I wonder like, how much would it cost to buy sea land?

1048
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:44,610
Honestly.

1049
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:48,350
I feel like I could crowdfund that.

1050
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:54,810
They're known as like the smallest country in the world.

1051
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:56,050
Oh, quote unquote country.

1052
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:03,370
Oh my god, I remembered I wanted to look up on how to get knighted.

1053
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:04,410
I see that.

1054
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,550
Wait, guys.

1055
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:11,270
Would you guys judge me if I used my super chat earnings to get knighted?

1056
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,710
By sea land?

1057
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:19,910
Would you guys judge me if I...

1058
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:23,710
So I can be like...

1059
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:25,030
What was it?

1060
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:25,730
Lady Doki?

1061
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:32,070
Wait, I can buy land on sea land too.

1062
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:33,810
Is it like the stock market?

1063
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:37,090
If I buy enough land, I'll legally own sea land?

1064
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,450
Is that even a thing?

1065
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:43,910
Yeah, because sea land is like...

1066
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:49,490
It was basically a British, quote unquote colony in the sea.

1067
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,010
Which is like a British sea base.

1068
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:56,830
And then the family that owned the sea base was like, I declare independence!

1069
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:59,390
Even though they're nearly at justice.

1070
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:03,630
They're a sea base too.

1071
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,630
So like...

1072
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:12,750
Yeah, it was a British fort and then the family that owned it was like, you know what?

1073
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,290
We're gonna be our own country.

1074
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:18,450
Even though like, I don't know how that's fucking possible.

1075
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:32,810
But like, I wonder if it's like the stock market where if I buy enough territory off of sea land, I'll just legally own it.

1076
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:38,170
Oh my god!

1077
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,790
Did he come back?!

1078
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:41,590
Oh my god.

1079
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:43,390
I was trying to go help.

1080
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:47,590
No, thank you for the magenta soup!

1081
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:48,830
Thank you!

1082
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:53,910
I'd judge you if you didn't use the super chat to get united!

1083
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:56,730
Also, wheels are cracked in this game.

1084
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:00,130
They are considered top three best weapons.

1085
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,070
So if you love them, go to town.

1086
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,570
I love the wheel weapon.

1087
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:06,230
But like, I don't have a strong enough wheel.

1088
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:09,270
The sword is like 90, so like...

1089
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:10,990
I'm just using the sword just cause...

1090
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:12,730
Oh yeah, just cause it's at like 80.

1091
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:15,050
For the... to cheer up.

1092
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:17,650
Alright.

1093
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:19,810
That's fine.

1094
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:26,090
I just wanna screw up with British one more time.

1095
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:28,610
Nice, I did it.

1096
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:29,990
I did it, guys!

1097
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:31,250
No need to...

1098
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:33,450
That's right!

1099
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:34,750
I'm a hero!

1100
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,030
I did it, guys!

1101
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:39,970
No need to thank me!

1102
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:46,730
Wait, what is the strongest weapon in this game?

1103
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,630
It doesn't get stronger.

1104
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:53,730
You have to like, find them.

1105
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:54,850
Okay.

1106
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,250
Wait, did they kill everybody?

1107
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:58,690
Did you guys do it?

1108
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:04,670
I nearly saved your life!

1109
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:10,970
Damn!

1110
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:14,690
First time...

1111
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:15,670
That's a politician.

1112
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,030
Wait, first time...

1113
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:20,430
working with a politician?

1114
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:23,130
Like...

1115
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:24,150
Really?

1116
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:25,470
Nah, bro.

1117
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:27,850
That's basically like...

1118
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:29,130
a lot of...

1119
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:31,250
the rest of the world.

1120
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:37,330
Wait, he came back?

1121
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:39,450
Sounds about right, yeah.

1122
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:42,090
Wait, I can get knighted in Ireland?

1123
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,790
What if I just get knighted...

1124
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:45,950
knighted like, in all the British colonies?

1125
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:48,430
Like, ex-British colonies...

1126
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:50,170
Sorry, Ireland's not British, but like...

1127
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:51,970
in all the British territory.

1128
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:56,010
Or like, ex-British territory.

1129
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:00,510
Wait, I can?

1130
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:01,770
I can just get knighted everywhere?

1131
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:04,430
Oh my god, guys, would you judge me if I...

1132
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:07,910
Wait, can I get knighted in Canada?

1133
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:10,130
Wait, I can get knighted in Canada?

1134
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:11,950
Okay, look.

1135
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:14,750
As soon as I kill you, I need to figure out how I can get knighted in Canada.

1136
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:17,730
Wait, I wanna get...

1137
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:20,590
What if I...

1138
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:23,030
What if I just get knighted in Canada, guys?

1139
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:27,270
I will if you don't.

1140
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,790
Oh my god.

1141
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:30,590
Wait, who's gonna knight me?

1142
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:33,110
Like...

1143
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:34,730
Wait a minute, but we...

1144
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:35,970
We don't even have...

1145
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:36,810
We have a problem.

1146
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:39,150
Okay, no, we kicked him out.

1147
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:43,170
Just because you can doesn't mean you shit.

1148
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:44,670
But that means...

1149
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:47,490
I could be the first VTuber to get knighted.

1150
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:50,190
Guys...

1151
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:53,950
Think about the dexterity article they're gonna write about me.

1152
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:59,610
Think about it.

1153
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:02,370
Think about the dexterity...

1154
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,260
It's good publicity.

1155
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,280
It's a business investment.

1156
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,160
Oh my god, I could like...

1157
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,700
When I buy my knighthood, I could like...

1158
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,740
I could actually just use it as a...

1159
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:18,480
Tax write-off.

1160
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,400
As a business...

1161
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,220
It could be...

1162
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,580
It could actually just be my...

1163
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,920
Business expense.

1164
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:32,660
Yes, I did it.

1165
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,460
True, cause it was for content.

1166
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,020
It was literally for my business.

1167
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,400
Okay, we gotta go that way now.

1168
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:43,920
Oh my god.

1169
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,940
I'm so smart.

1170
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,720
I'm actually a ruthless business woman.

1171
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,140
Oh my god!

1172
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:55,780
I'll just do an outfit reveal of a Nikon outfit and then be like...

1173
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:57,480
Guys, as an official knighted...

1174
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:03,360
This is now a business expense.

1175
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,440
No way, that's genius.

1176
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,020
Wait, nobles sell their...

1177
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,340
Wait, nobles sell their titles?

1178
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:19,820
Alright, it's time.

1179
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,040
Let's go!

1180
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,240
For Doki!

1181
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,240
Oh my god, I could actually...

1182
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,140
Okay, okay.

1183
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:31,980
Oh, that's awkward.

1184
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,840
That's so awkward.

1185
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,760
Wait, that's not fair!

1186
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,540
How come they could do that And I couldn't!

1187
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:45,340
Why were they able to do that?

1188
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,120
Oh my god, wait.

1189
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:49,880
They're so strong.

1190
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,800
Oh, nice.

1191
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:53,940
Okay.

1192
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,120
Why could they do that and I couldn't do that?

1193
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,760
Okay, but then...

1194
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:05,080
Okay guys, the reason why Elton John can be knighted is because he's literally Elton John.

1195
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,580
The only thing I cannot get is like...

1196
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:13,340
Oh shit.

1197
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,160
I wonder if a Shiro would ever get knighted.

1198
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,780
Can you imagine?

1199
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:20,440
If like...

1200
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,420
Oh my god, what's his name?

1201
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,500
What is the name of like...

1202
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,600
Cause like...

1203
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,540
Oh my god, who's the king again?

1204
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:31,220
Charles?

1205
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,760
Queen Elizabeth has been my queen for so long.

1206
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,100
Like, I don't even...

1207
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,180
I don't even know what his name is.

1208
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,140
Not my king!

1209
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,980
Not my king!

1210
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,780
It's Charles, right?

1211
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,300
What is Charles' kid's kid called?

1212
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:55,200
Guys.

1213
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,720
I can actually...

1214
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:58,540
Not gonna lie.

1215
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,800
I can see...

1216
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,580
Hashtag not my king.

1217
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,400
William?

1218
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:09,940
No, no.

1219
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,800
Charles' kid's kid.

1220
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:13,680
So like...

1221
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,380
Not the other...

1222
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:16,640
Not Princess Diana's...

1223
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,200
I like how I remember Princess Diana.

1224
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:21,780
Not...

1225
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,240
Oh shit.

1226
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:22,700
Oh my god.

1227
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,740
This nerd's gonna beat me up with his hands.

1228
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:26,840
Is it George?

1229
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:29,100
Okay.

1230
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:31,220
I can see George...

1231
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:32,720
Knighting his favorite streamer.

1232
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:33,420
I...

1233
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:37,920
I can't...

1234
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,720
I can't... Not gonna lie.

1235
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,740
I can see like...

1236
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,740
George growing up to his favorite streamer.

1237
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,140
And then like...

1238
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:46,380
He's like...

1239
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,820
Whoever he is...

1240
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:50,180
I can see him knight.

1241
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,540
Wait, George can't become king?

1242
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:55,420
Yes he can.

1243
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,840
Isn't he like the first...

1244
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:01,420
The first point of...

1245
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:02,760
Of the other king?

1246
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:03,760
Of the other child?

1247
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,820
Of the other... Princess Diana's kid?

1248
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:06,480
William?

1249
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,420
I don't know how the royalty works.

1250
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,360
Alright, nice.

1251
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:21,620
Yeah, the first point of William.

1252
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:22,980
He should be king next.

1253
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:23,980
After William dies.

1254
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:29,860
Yes.

1255
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,880
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1256
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,360
I can see...

1257
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,000
Whenever George becomes king...

1258
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,760
He's gonna like...

1259
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,020
Knight his favorite streamer.

1260
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:41,360
He's like...

1261
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,240
You know...

1262
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,740
A lot of like...

1263
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,180
People in position of power...

1264
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,240
Kids...

1265
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,840
Are fans of streamers now.

1266
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,200
And a lot like...

1267
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,240
You know how like...

1268
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,480
A lot of celebrity kids...

1269
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,220
Are collaborating with streamers.

1270
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:58,860
Because they're like...

1271
01:03:58,860 --> 01:03:59,920
My dad's famous.

1272
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:01,360
Or my mom's famous.

1273
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:03,080
So you should collaborate with me.

1274
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,540
To their favorite streamers.

1275
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:05,780
And obviously they're like...

1276
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:06,560
Oh my god.

1277
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,720
Your dad slash mom is this celebrity.

1278
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:14,760
I feel like...

1279
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,100
Eventually we're gonna hit the stage...

1280
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:20,120
Where a streamer's gonna be knighted.

1281
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:23,880
Uh...

1282
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,000
Thank you for the super chat.

1283
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,360
Thank you for Dokia.

1284
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:30,260
Thank you for the super chat.

1285
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,300
Thank you.

1286
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:33,720
Thank you.

1287
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,300
You think Dokia's ego sucking goes too hard now?

1288
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:38,680
Wait till she gets knighted.

1289
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,740
Thank you for the super chat.

1290
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,220
Thank you.

1291
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:44,480
Any celebrity children watching me?

1292
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,540
Any celebrity kids?

1293
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,780
Okay, and then we'll go here.

1294
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:52,040
I should really read what I just upgraded.

1295
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:55,760
Um...

1296
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,500
Guys, come on.

1297
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,180
I must have a famous celebrity child watching me, right?

1298
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,660
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

1299
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:08,660
Thank you, thank you.

1300
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:21,200
Thank you, Dokia.

1301
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,640
Oh my god, thank you so much.

1302
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:29,200
Wait, can I just get a certificate?

1303
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,660
Oh, that sounds very...

1304
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:46,880
Oh yeah, I was gonna say that does not sound like the best place to live.

1305
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,040
Sounds like Louisiana.

1306
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,900
What the fuck is going on in Louisiana?

1307
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:04,240
Louisiana?

1308
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:09,520
I don't know about Detroit, but Louisiana?

1309
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,300
Okay, everything happens in Detroit.

1310
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,340
No, I feel like...

1311
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:23,700
Okay, anarchy works.

1312
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,500
It's fun after like a day or two.

1313
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:27,900
But then like...

1314
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,940
But then...

1315
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:32,840
I think anarchy is fun after a day or two.

1316
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,460
But then it's like post-anarchy.

1317
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,060
You know like...

1318
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:39,860
Post-anarchy...

1319
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:42,120
Clarity?

1320
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,680
And then you're just like...

1321
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:44,760
Oh, maybe it's not that.

1322
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,140
Post-anarchy clarity.

1323
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:07,060
Hmm.

1324
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:21,400
Yeah, but he just wants to be the king of everything.

1325
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,680
Or the emperor.

1326
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:29,760
Damn.

1327
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:47,520
Wow.

1328
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,260
What conversation?

1329
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:54,080
I said one word.

1330
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,960
This conversation is going on too long.

1331
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:58,140
I'm like, okay.

1332
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:03,440
I said one word.

1333
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:06,660
How dare you interrupt my thought process.

1334
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:07,500
Too long.

1335
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:09,060
Be off with you.

1336
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,700
I need someone that doesn't talk back.

1337
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:16,500
Alright, let's go grab our gifts.

1338
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:18,760
I got a battler.

1339
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,220
I got an old coin.

1340
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,240
Okay, nice.

1341
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,160
I'm talking to you.

1342
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,340
Not with you.

1343
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:28,640
Okay.

1344
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,300
Gah!

1345
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:31,700
Gah!

1346
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,650
I'm not going to do any of the other side quests.

1347
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:40,940
Zacona, thank you for the super chat.

1348
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,120
Thank you, thank you.

1349
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,000
I just finished my fourth semester.

1350
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,000
And now I'm going for an interview tomorrow.

1351
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,260
For an internship at a five-star hotel.

1352
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:49,700
I think I'm going to die from stress.

1353
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:50,660
Pray for me, guys.

1354
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:51,460
Thank you for the super chat.

1355
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,080
Thank you, thank you.

1356
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,980
Good luck with your interview.

1357
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:56,320
Oh my god, it's going to be crazy.

1358
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,440
Working at a hotel.

1359
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,300
The shit you're going to see.

1360
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,320
There's a lot of crazy hotel stories, too.

1361
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:04,480
I used to watch...

1362
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,560
Was it Hotel Babylon?

1363
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,640
I don't know if you guys ever read the Babylon series.

1364
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,380
A hotel Babylon.

1365
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,660
There was an airline Babylon.

1366
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:15,600
And shit like that.

1367
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,600
Where they grab interviews.

1368
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:21,900
And stories from people who worked at hotels.

1369
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,440
And worked at airlines.

1370
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,180
And stuff like that.

1371
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:25,660
Hotel Babylon was freaking crazy.

1372
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:27,140
I wish they never cancelled that show.

1373
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:28,200
That was such a good show.

1374
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,340
And you're going to see a lot of crazy stories.

1375
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:33,620
Especially five-star hotels.

1376
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:35,580
Because people who work that money.

1377
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,780
Who work...

1378
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,360
Wait, defeat Xiaohu Yun?

1379
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:40,400
What the fuck?

1380
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,960
Wait, why am I...

1381
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,920
Wait, why am I killing Xiaohu Yun?

1382
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:50,700
Oh shit!

1383
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:51,900
Wait, why am I...

1384
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,620
Why am I attacking Tao Tao's generals?

1385
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:58,580
I feel like...

1386
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:00,060
I feel like...

1387
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,460
Especially the mega rich people.

1388
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,040
They do some...

1389
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,080
They're so rich.

1390
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,560
That they're bored with regular mundane stuff.

1391
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:09,780
That they do crazy...

1392
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:12,800
For the mega super rich.

1393
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:13,780
They're like...

1394
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:15,820
They can do anything now.

1395
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:19,240
They just do really fucked up shit.

1396
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,140
I like to be like...

1397
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:21,200
To feel the thrill.

1398
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:24,740
I didn't pay attention.

1399
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,920
I just saw...

1400
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,220
Upgrade and I was like...

1401
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:29,660
Oh, upgrade!

1402
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:31,320
Oh shit, where's my horse?

1403
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:32,420
It disappeared.

1404
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,880
I need to jump over here.

1405
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:36,280
How do I jump with my horse again?

1406
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,440
Oh well, I'll just go down here.

1407
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:47,480
Hello?

1408
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:47,780
Hello?

1409
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:50,600
Oh wait.

1410
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:51,720
Eh, Shao Chun.

1411
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,600
When will they shoot an arrow in your eye?

1412
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:58,500
Get him.

1413
01:10:58,680 --> 01:10:59,300
Get this nerd.

1414
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:00,840
Not so wise now.

1415
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:04,200
Shouldn't have gone to the battlefield you fucking nerd.

1416
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:04,720
Get out.

1417
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:08,120
Oh wait, there's another guy here.

1418
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,240
That's fucking right.

1419
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:17,860
That's fucking right.

1420
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,480
I feel like a lot of...

1421
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:22,580
Oh shit.

1422
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,080
I feel like...

1423
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,640
I mean, even Bill Gates is insane.

1424
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,260
I was like...

1425
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:33,900
No, Bill Gates!

1426
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,460
I thought you were just like...

1427
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:37,620
A fucking nerd!

1428
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,560
Like a grandpa nerd!

1429
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:43,000
But then I found out Bill Gates is fucking wild.

1430
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:44,320
Like...

1431
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,520
He's fucking wild!

1432
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,540
And then I'm like thinking like...

1433
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:52,820
If Bill Gates can do that and he's like...

1434
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:53,460
What, 80?

1435
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,160
What the fuck is Warren Buffet doing?

1436
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,520
Oh my god!

1437
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,160
Freaky Gates.

1438
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,080
What did he do?

1439
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,180
I'm not gonna say it.

1440
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,360
It's actually pretty freaky.

1441
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:10,740
I'm not gonna say it.

1442
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,620
I was like...

1443
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:15,700
Oh my god!

1444
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:18,220
What the fuck does Warren Buffet do?

1445
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:22,640
If anything, Warren Buffet is actually like...

1446
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,400
Some actual grandpa.

1447
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,760
Okay, I'm just gonna go straight to...

1448
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,140
Cause like the mission is just to kill Xiaohu Yuan, right?

1449
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:34,840
Defeat... Okay, yeah.

1450
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,600
Oh my god, get out!

1451
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:37,680
Get out!

1452
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:37,800
Get out!

1453
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:40,360
Send me through!

1454
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:42,620
Okay, there you go.

1455
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:45,500
There you are.

1456
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:47,900
Oh shit.

1457
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,780
God, he sounds so weird.

1458
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,460
Sounding like a regular guy.

1459
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,240
Get out of here.

1460
01:12:58,660 --> 01:12:59,420
That's fucking right.

1461
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,400
I broke your guard.

1462
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,120
That's fucking right.

1463
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,620
Get out of here.

1464
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:10,540
Oh my god.

1465
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,080
I know two buttons!

1466
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:14,520
And that's all the buttons I need to know!

1467
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,320
Okay, I need to block this and take...

1468
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,100
Where's the jar?

1469
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:20,200
Oh, there you are.

1470
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:20,920
Wait, what?

1471
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:22,720
What does the jar do then?

1472
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,560
I thought the jar was musou.

1473
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,560
No, the musou is alcohol.

1474
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,700
Get over here.

1475
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:31,380
Yes it is!

1476
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,240
Oh shit, oh nice.

1477
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:36,780
Counter.

1478
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:38,700
That's fucking right.

1479
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:39,760
Get over here!

1480
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:43,740
Oh fuck.

1481
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,700
That's right, I have four bread.

1482
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,000
Oh, I have three bread.

1483
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:47,980
Oh fuck!

1484
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:52,820
Oh no.

1485
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,440
No, no, no, no, no!

1486
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,220
He's almost dead, don't worry!

1487
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:57,800
Live a little longer!

1488
01:13:57,940 --> 01:13:59,420
He's almost dead, I almost got him!

1489
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,360
Live a little longer!

1490
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,200
I almost got him!

1491
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:09,760
Just live a little longer, guys!

1492
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,360
Oh no.

1493
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,020
Oh, there you go.

1494
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,360
Nice.

1495
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:17,780
We did it.

1496
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:18,800
It's over.

1497
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:21,080
I'm losing.

1498
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,400
Pulls out a bow.

1499
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,540
Ye olde medieval gun.

1500
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,420
Pulls out the ye olde medieval gun.

1501
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,460
Oh no, no, no, no, no!

1502
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,020
Okay, nice.

1503
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,660
Increases mounted stability.

1504
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,500
Okay, so I just have to level up Birch.

1505
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:44,960
He's actually the strongest horse in this game.

1506
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:52,340
Abso, thank you for the super chat!

1507
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:53,100
Thank you, thank you!

1508
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:55,560
How has your day been?

1509
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:57,380
This conversation has gone on too long.

1510
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,940
Thank you for the super chat!

1511
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:01,960
Thank you, thank you!

1512
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,340
Increases the vitality.

1513
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,820
Restores health by... Oh wait, what?

1514
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,740
Wait, that's...

1515
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:16,320
Wait, also like... I have better strikes?

1516
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:17,420
What's this?

1517
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:21,080
Okay, I don't think I need the mad dash or whatever the fuck.

1518
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:24,680
Uh, attack while in the sand will unleash a shockwave and go airborne.

1519
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:32,200
World wind kick, mad blade rush catching enemies and then okay, I think I'll try a mad blade rush for this.

1520
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:39,120
Uh... what did I see I wanted to try out... what's accessories?

1521
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,000
Boost attack.

1522
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:48,640
It was like 70% or some sh- Okay, it's not any of these.

1523
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:49,560
Okay, never mind.

1524
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:51,540
Do I have anything better?

1525
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:54,340
Or is this like my best weapon?

1526
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,280
Yeah, this is actually my best weapon.

1527
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:02,300
I don't have enough money to buy better weapons yet.

1528
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:04,020
Ah!

1529
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:06,520
Oh, there's an item.

1530
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:07,140
Item!

1531
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:10,020
Oh, who's this old man?

1532
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:10,640
Hello?

1533
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:15,900
Take this.

1534
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:17,160
I hope it'll serve you well.

1535
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,360
Oh, thank you, old man.

1536
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,200
Okay, cool.

1537
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,260
Thank you, old man.

1538
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,260
I appreciate it.

1539
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,220
What is this?

1540
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:37,840
Oh, I'm too low level.

1541
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,620
Oh wait, what's this?

1542
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,320
Is that fan mail?

1543
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,040
Oh, I don't have fan mail.

1544
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,480
No one wants to talk to me.

1545
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:52,100
Is the spear better than the sword, guys?

1546
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:53,360
Or which is better?

1547
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:54,520
The gauntlets or the spear?

1548
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:55,760
Or should I- Actually, I'm gonna save.

1549
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:56,340
Never mind.

1550
01:16:56,420 --> 01:17:01,460
I'm gonna save until I can afford a strong loopy loop.

1551
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:04,920
Oh, no.

1552
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,020
All the old goons died.

1553
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:11,920
No!

1554
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:18,260
Neo Dynasty goons all died in war and I killed them.

1555
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,280
I killed- Oh, shit!

1556
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:21,640
Okay.

1557
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:22,700
Wait, that's 80.

1558
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:23,720
Wait, that's what we need.

1559
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,200
Okay, it's time to sell.

1560
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:30,180
Oh, no.

1561
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,100
I'm so broke.

1562
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,920
Okay, I'm gonna sell the weapons I have that are useless.

1563
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:36,960
Okay, 42.

1564
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:38,680
Do I have enough?

1565
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:39,720
Oh, I don't.

1566
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:40,520
I'm so poor.

1567
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:42,620
Oh, no.

1568
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,840
And I killed them, too.

1569
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:46,780
It was me.

1570
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,720
Wait, I just need to sell one more.

1571
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,420
Uh, I'll sell this.

1572
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:57,420
Okay, I should have- Okay, I should be able to afford the crimson orchids.

1573
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:00,140
Which normal attack?

1574
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,920
Okay, these are like the strong ones.

1575
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:02,840
Yes.

1576
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:08,880
Uh, whirlwind kick, palm strike.

1577
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,780
Okay, that should be everything, right?

1578
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:14,860
Whirlwind kick.

1579
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:18,740
The counter has attack while in the sanctuary will unleash a shockwave.

1580
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:19,800
Okay, I'd rather have that.

1581
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,680
And then... yeah, all right.

1582
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,860
Wait, why can I still talk here?

1583
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,020
I already looked at all the new weapons.

1584
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,820
Oh, the shittier new weapons.

1585
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:33,620
Okay, Hong Gai.

1586
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,760
I'm ready for Route H.

1587
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:44,290
Sun Jian Headquarters.

1588
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:49,350
You can beat a high level side battle.

1589
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:50,610
I believe, Doki.

1590
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:53,390
You see, I could, but then I'm wasting my time.

1591
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:55,930
No, thank you for the super chat.

1592
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:56,350
Thank you.

1593
01:18:56,610 --> 01:19:00,030
I want you to help us take care of some bandits.

1594
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:02,270
We have an entire army.

1595
01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:04,050
Your family's literally rich.

1596
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:08,170
This is one of his responsibilities.

1597
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:12,030
Oh husband, you bought too expensive meal and now we're homeless.

1598
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:16,390
But having you with us really tips the scales in our favor.

1599
01:19:16,930 --> 01:19:19,790
Hong Gai, I have something I want to ask you.

1600
01:19:19,810 --> 01:19:22,010
Oh my god, is that Sun Qian Qian?

1601
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:24,630
Sorry, I can't pronounce your name.

1602
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:29,610
I'm not Doki.

1603
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:34,250
This is the warrior who had all of our backs during the battle with the yellow turbans.

1604
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:35,750
She's so different.

1605
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:40,670
She looks so different.

1606
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,410
She's like more woman.

1607
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:48,050
You're supposed to be a child right now.

1608
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:59,130
Okay, in the beginning, she used to be more... yeah, I was like, she's supposed to be 12.

1609
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:01,570
I was like...

1610
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:04,750
Okay, um...

1611
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:07,950
In the beginning of the games, she was more tomboy.

1612
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:10,970
She was like really like tomboy coded.

1613
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:15,970
But then like as the game progressed, she got like more and more less...

1614
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:17,270
Yes, tomboy erasured.

1615
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:20,890
Like we are experiencing tomboy eraser right now.

1616
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:23,050
They're erasing all tomboy.

1617
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:30,170
What brings you here?

1618
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:35,670
Terrible.

1619
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:53,030
Dude, your assassination 10 games ago.

1620
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:53,890
In the making.

1621
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:56,450
I think she's wearing armor, you know.

1622
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:58,350
Except for the middle of her chest.

1623
01:20:58,390 --> 01:21:00,130
I could just get a sword and go...

1624
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:07,630
Her voice even got higher.

1625
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:17,930
The jade is really strong.

1626
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:32,770
Yeah, like in the beginning of the games, she was like very tomboy coded.

1627
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,890
Like even her voice was lower and everything.

1628
01:21:38,330 --> 01:21:43,290
Okay, Sun Jian's forces versus Wuxian's forces.

1629
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:44,790
Uh...

1630
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:46,450
12king, thank you for the super chat.

1631
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:46,770
Thank you.

1632
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:47,350
Thank you.

1633
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:50,630
Fun fact, historically Sun Xianxian is at most...

1634
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:54,370
Yeah, I was gonna be like, are you supposed to be a fucking child right now?

1635
01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:55,190
What are you doing?

1636
01:21:55,330 --> 01:21:56,890
Who let this child at the battlefield?

1637
01:21:57,090 --> 01:21:57,790
Like...

1638
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:01,710
She can be the strongest child.

1639
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:04,370
At least she's wearing shorts underneath that dress.

1640
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:13,050
No child label.

1641
01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:18,450
You're right, her father.

1642
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:21,030
I mean her dad beats up tigers.

1643
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:31,230
It is our hope that you can achieve similar results in our service.

1644
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:34,510
But it wouldn't be right to put all the pressure on you.

1645
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:37,270
That's why you and I will be working together.

1646
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:39,250
Oh, together.

1647
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:42,310
I think it would be better if I went with you.

1648
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:43,690
Excuse me, Sun Xianxian?

1649
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:49,910
How dare you interfere?

1650
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:53,630
It seems Shang Xiang has taken a liking to you.

1651
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:54,950
Oh, please no.

1652
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:56,050
No, no, that's illegal.

1653
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:58,410
Oh, please.

1654
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:04,530
Oh, no, no, Sun Xianxian.

1655
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:09,390
Oh, wait a minute.

1656
01:23:12,630 --> 01:23:13,930
No, no, FBI.

1657
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:14,790
I said no.

1658
01:23:15,150 --> 01:23:16,010
I said no.

1659
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:17,910
Let's move on to the middle, shall we?

1660
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:23,110
You have a bunch of guys.

1661
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:28,730
Just like, I don't know, a guy who's been a warrior for most of his life or a literal child.

1662
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:30,830
I don't know who I want to fight with, guys.

1663
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:37,110
A faction that rejects the legitimacy of the rule of the Han has risen up in Shang Xiang.

1664
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:39,370
We've been given a task of quelling the rebellion.

1665
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:43,650
The rebels follow Wu Xian, who I'm told is a former bandit leader.

1666
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:46,890
Defeating him will bring a swift end to the uprising.

1667
01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:49,950
I'll command all our forces personally.

1668
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:54,810
To do so, I plan to start the battle by assessing the situation from our headquarters.

1669
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:58,430
The correct choice is to go alone.

1670
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:03,390
Thank you for the super chat.

1671
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:03,690
Thank you.

1672
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:04,030
Thank you.

1673
01:24:04,150 --> 01:24:07,130
Ever since the Lu Bei marriage subplot, they've ruined the tomboy.

1674
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:07,690
No!

1675
01:24:09,390 --> 01:24:12,410
My lord, my tomboy eraser.

1676
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:15,990
Does this mean that you expect some unforeseen threats from the enemy?

1677
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:17,090
I do.

1678
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:21,170
Ou Xing's forces are lying in wait in their own stronghold.

1679
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:23,050
We should assume that they have set traps for us.

1680
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:23,690
Right.

1681
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:27,530
Judging by the Terran, I'd say ambushes are likely.

1682
01:24:29,810 --> 01:24:31,990
But there are so many places they could be hiding.

1683
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:34,270
You can't possibly guess where they'll come from.

1684
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:37,270
Which is why...

1685
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:39,890
we should proceed as carefully as possible.

1686
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:44,830
Our top priority would be to maintain an even advance as we push the front line.

1687
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:47,770
Luckily, we have a reliable ally for this fight.

1688
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:54,250
Not Doki, I want you to keep an eye on how the battle plays out and go wherever you are needed.

1689
01:24:54,810 --> 01:24:56,110
You're short of hands, Not Doki.

1690
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:57,370
Then allow me to join you.

1691
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:00,410
You need butt ass before we leave for battle.

1692
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:01,530
I think... Okay.

1693
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:02,950
No, no, no, no, no, no, child.

1694
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:03,690
You stay.

1695
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:04,890
No, no, it's okay.

1696
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:07,490
Come tell me when... No, it's okay, child.

1697
01:25:09,890 --> 01:25:10,730
No, no, no.

1698
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:12,490
The adults are talking right now.

1699
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:14,110
The adults are talking.

1700
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:19,030
You can now select... Do I want a child?

1701
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:21,150
Or...

1702
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:23,070
Or...

1703
01:25:23,070 --> 01:25:29,210
Which one should... I like how they put a child... the child in as my main choice.

1704
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:30,750
They're like, come on.

1705
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:32,310
Go alone.

1706
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:34,450
Or should I just go alone?

1707
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:41,390
Guys, take the five-year-old child.

1708
01:25:41,810 --> 01:25:45,590
Do I take a general that's been in many, many wars?

1709
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:47,570
Or should I... Let's just... You know, you're right.

1710
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:48,870
You're right, guys.

1711
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:52,250
Let me... Let me bring the child to her first war.

1712
01:25:57,130 --> 01:26:02,890
All right, let's bring... Let's bring... Let's show this child her first war.

1713
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:09,270
Bring your kids a work day.

1714
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,770
It's their first one.

1715
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:15,370
Let's go.

1716
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:18,650
Oh my god, they have the high ground?

1717
01:26:20,590 --> 01:26:23,850
Oh no, not the high ground.

1718
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:28,550
Oh shit.

1719
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:32,550
How is morale already falling?

1720
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:36,170
We literally just started the war!

1721
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:42,790
Okay, let's grab him out of here.

1722
01:26:43,410 --> 01:26:43,630
Nice.

1723
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:47,610
Nice, we did it.

1724
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:50,490
Push the ambush.

1725
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:51,510
I'll get this one first.

1726
01:26:53,490 --> 01:26:54,430
Get over here.

1727
01:26:57,250 --> 01:27:00,210
You brought a child instead of a war god.

1728
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:04,610
That might... That might be what's lowering morale right now.

1729
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:09,010
You guys told me to bring her!

1730
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:15,950
How is it my fault when I was just listening to you guys?

1731
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:19,350
If anything, it's all... Both are false.

1732
01:27:21,330 --> 01:27:23,130
We both fucked up, guys.

1733
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:33,890
He said go.

1734
01:27:34,130 --> 01:27:36,870
Oh, that's not... No, no, no, no, no.

1735
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:40,070
I saw more people said take the child.

1736
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:43,650
I... I saw you said take the child.

1737
01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:48,330
All right.

1738
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:50,870
Come on, get over here.

1739
01:27:51,010 --> 01:27:52,070
Where the fuck is my...

1740
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:54,530
Where the fuck is Xu Shanshan?

1741
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:56,770
Where's she going?

1742
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:02,190
Why is she not helping me?

1743
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:13,930
Okay, the fight's almost over, but thanks for joining the war.

1744
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:15,230
I should have brought the old man.

1745
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:16,330
I should have.

1746
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:23,610
Why did I bring... Why did I bring a child?

1747
01:28:29,230 --> 01:28:30,430
All right, nice.

1748
01:28:31,290 --> 01:28:33,090
All right, Xu Shanshan.

1749
01:28:34,990 --> 01:28:37,730
Oh shit, I keep accidentally getting off my horse.

1750
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:42,090
Okay, we have to...

1751
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:43,630
We have to go to the other side.

1752
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:47,490
She's trying to learn, Doki.

1753
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:50,190
How do I jump?

1754
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:53,390
Guys, I don't remember how to jump on my horse.

1755
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:55,810
Like, I'm stuck here.

1756
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:56,790
I'm stuck in the farm.

1757
01:28:57,050 --> 01:28:58,470
Guys, guys, how do I jump?

1758
01:28:58,610 --> 01:28:59,570
I'm stuck on my farm.

1759
01:29:00,350 --> 01:29:01,410
Oh, never mind.

1760
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:02,170
I figured it out.

1761
01:29:04,070 --> 01:29:06,090
The farm has stopped, Doki.

1762
01:29:08,350 --> 01:29:09,470
Who would win?

1763
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:11,350
One tiny fence or...

1764
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:14,990
Or a decorated war general.

1765
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:21,190
Let's get him out of the way.

1766
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:23,870
Oh shit.

1767
01:29:25,910 --> 01:29:27,650
Oh my god, come on.

1768
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:28,390
Stop!

1769
01:29:29,830 --> 01:29:31,210
This is not fun anymore.

1770
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:31,670
Stop!

1771
01:29:33,610 --> 01:29:34,450
That's fucking right.

1772
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:36,250
That's right.

1773
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:36,870
I'm stronger.

1774
01:29:37,410 --> 01:29:37,830
Oh, yeah?

1775
01:29:37,970 --> 01:29:39,170
You thought you got me?

1776
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:40,050
Get counter-attacked.

1777
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:42,630
That's fucking right.

1778
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:43,590
Get out of here.

1779
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:45,130
I did it.

1780
01:29:45,170 --> 01:29:46,330
No need to thank me.

1781
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:52,310
Okay, we just gotta get this fort, too.

1782
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:55,090
The fence of war.

1783
01:29:57,410 --> 01:29:58,030
That's right.

1784
01:29:58,110 --> 01:29:58,670
Get out of here.

1785
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:03,230
What if I just go straight to the big boy?

1786
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:07,310
No, I feel like Xinjiang's gonna actually die if I do that.

1787
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:14,030
So like, I feel like the more generals I defeat, the more upgrades I get, right guys?

1788
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:14,830
Is that true?

1789
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:21,350
If I don't rush straight to the main boss, do I get like, uh...

1790
01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:25,770
Do I get more XP by killing the mini bo- guys?

1791
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:29,670
Okay, let's get him out of here.

1792
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:30,550
Yeah?

1793
01:30:30,770 --> 01:30:31,130
Okay.

1794
01:30:31,490 --> 01:30:33,590
All right, then I'll keep killing the mini generals.

1795
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:34,970
Oh shit.

1796
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:35,990
Oh my god.

1797
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:37,790
Oh shit, no!

1798
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:40,150
Oh, that's scary.

1799
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:41,110
I didn't see the red.

1800
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:43,030
Nice.

1801
01:30:43,870 --> 01:30:44,610
Get out of here.

1802
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:45,750
My fort now.

1803
01:30:48,290 --> 01:30:50,690
I feel like she's useless.

1804
01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:51,790
Not gonna lie.

1805
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:57,770
I don't know.

1806
01:30:58,030 --> 01:31:01,830
I have a feeling she feels a little useless.

1807
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:10,090
I don't wonder why.

1808
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:14,090
Okay, but she was bragging, okay?

1809
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:20,310
She was like, um, I am a warrior princess and like, um...

1810
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:25,990
Yeah, I'm pretty strong, says an eight-year-old to my face.

1811
01:31:30,550 --> 01:31:33,450
Okay, let's get her out of the way.

1812
01:31:34,670 --> 01:31:36,450
Uh, Cosmo, thank you for the super chat!

1813
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:37,510
Thank you, thank you!

1814
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:41,250
Sunshan- Sunshan Shen needs to complete her apprenticeship.

1815
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:42,470
Ow, okay.

1816
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:45,650
Okay, nice.

1817
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:46,490
Easy.

1818
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:49,590
And why did you believe- I don't know!

1819
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:50,870
Because she's royalty?

1820
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:52,690
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

1821
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:53,890
Wait, what the fuck?

1822
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:55,630
Why is there like 200 men out here?

1823
01:31:58,110 --> 01:32:00,490
I didn't think she would lie to me like that.

1824
01:32:02,370 --> 01:32:03,610
Like, where are they going?

1825
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:07,170
Where are you guys running to?

1826
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:07,870
Hello?

1827
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:10,450
Oh shit, they're all running to Sunshan!

1828
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:12,830
Oh, that's a lot of peoples.

1829
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:16,270
Okay, what if I do this?

1830
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:17,890
Nice.

1831
01:32:19,970 --> 01:32:22,270
We've got them right where we want them.

1832
01:32:25,050 --> 01:32:25,570
Now...

1833
01:32:25,570 --> 01:32:28,170
Where is he taking- where are they taking him?

1834
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:30,250
Oh my god, they're following him!

1835
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:31,730
Oh my god, look at him go!

1836
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:36,650
Look at him go!

1837
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:38,730
Get him!

1838
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:40,390
Get him!

1839
01:32:51,350 --> 01:32:53,350
He's got this, he can take them on.

1840
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:55,350
I believe in him.

1841
01:32:55,930 --> 01:32:56,950
Where are they taking him?

1842
01:32:57,810 --> 01:33:00,510
I know he's taking him to an ambush, but like...

1843
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:01,790
What's gonna happen?

1844
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:05,910
Oh, just one guy?

1845
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:11,810
How is that- There's 20 of them!

1846
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:13,250
There's 20 generals!

1847
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:21,990
Like- Guys, this is a- You know, when you said you had an ambush coming, I thought you'd bring more people.

1848
01:33:22,110 --> 01:33:23,390
You brought 20 guys.

1849
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:30,410
Like- He literally- He brought 20 guys and was like, Guys, don't worry, I got an ambush.

1850
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:33,470
Don't worry.

1851
01:33:34,230 --> 01:33:35,890
It's okay, it's soon.

1852
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:38,610
You are a beast.

1853
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:43,510
Okay.

1854
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:46,070
Go!

1855
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:48,970
Go!

1856
01:33:50,790 --> 01:33:51,150
Go!

1857
01:33:52,290 --> 01:33:55,610
Oh yeah, it wasn't like- I just literally killed all of them.

1858
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:56,670
In the back.

1859
01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:58,190
It's not like I did that, guys.

1860
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:58,730
Thanks, guys.

1861
01:33:58,790 --> 01:33:59,150
No, no.

1862
01:33:59,610 --> 01:34:00,890
It's all Soonhae.

1863
01:34:01,690 --> 01:34:02,910
Good for him.

1864
01:34:03,210 --> 01:34:04,430
Good for Soonhae.

1865
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:04,910
You know?

1866
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:05,610
Yeah, yeah.

1867
01:34:06,690 --> 01:34:07,910
Okay, we should get this guy.

1868
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:10,370
Yeah.

1869
01:34:11,690 --> 01:34:13,210
Yeah, it's not me, guys.

1870
01:34:13,370 --> 01:34:14,130
It wasn't me.

1871
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:15,350
Oh, except for this one guy.

1872
01:34:15,410 --> 01:34:16,530
What is this one guy doing here?

1873
01:34:20,450 --> 01:34:22,050
Okay, I'm gonna get back this.

1874
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:26,810
Nice.

1875
01:34:28,510 --> 01:34:29,290
My turn!

1876
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:31,110
That's fucking right.

1877
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:31,750
My turn!

1878
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:35,730
Okay, they might have the other force, but we got this fort.

1879
01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:37,390
This will be ours.

1880
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:39,750
Okay.

1881
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:42,270
That's fucking right.

1882
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:42,850
Get chopped!

1883
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:47,030
Come on!

1884
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:47,830
Get chopped!

1885
01:34:49,090 --> 01:34:50,310
Get out of here!

1886
01:34:50,790 --> 01:34:52,170
You might have a name!

1887
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:55,270
Thank you, Soonhae, for carrying Doki.

1888
01:34:55,730 --> 01:34:59,590
Thank you for the Saka-Supa technique.

1889
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:01,150
Thank you, thank you.

1890
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:04,010
Okay, nice.

1891
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:07,570
Okay, now a guy with no name.

1892
01:35:07,890 --> 01:35:08,810
Who's gonna win?

1893
01:35:09,450 --> 01:35:10,510
Oh my god, you know what?

1894
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:11,690
No, I believe in Soonhae.

1895
01:35:11,890 --> 01:35:12,850
Let's just watch this.

1896
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:15,030
I believe in this child.

1897
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:15,790
Let's go help.

1898
01:35:15,870 --> 01:35:17,030
Let's go see how she does.

1899
01:35:17,490 --> 01:35:17,810
No, look!

1900
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:18,050
Look!

1901
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:18,750
She's doing it!

1902
01:35:18,790 --> 01:35:19,370
Look at that!

1903
01:35:19,530 --> 01:35:20,170
Go, child!

1904
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:20,670
Go!

1905
01:35:20,910 --> 01:35:21,790
You got this!

1906
01:35:22,230 --> 01:35:22,490
Come on!

1907
01:35:22,710 --> 01:35:23,830
She's so dead!

1908
01:35:23,930 --> 01:35:24,310
Come on!

1909
01:35:24,430 --> 01:35:24,730
Yeah!

1910
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:26,530
Look at that!

1911
01:35:26,990 --> 01:35:27,790
Look at that!

1912
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:28,690
She did it.

1913
01:35:29,610 --> 01:35:30,910
She did it, guys.

1914
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:33,430
No name general lost to a child.

1915
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:37,430
Look at that.

1916
01:35:37,890 --> 01:35:39,090
Yay, child!

1917
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:41,170
Okay, not like that, guys.

1918
01:35:41,290 --> 01:35:43,710
Not like that, though, guys.

1919
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:45,570
Not like that.

1920
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:50,670
Save Soonjin right now.

1921
01:35:50,830 --> 01:35:52,190
I'll take the no name.

1922
01:35:53,230 --> 01:35:57,370
I'll kill the no name general and then you get the guy that actually is a threat.

1923
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:02,530
Okay.

1924
01:36:02,530 --> 01:36:02,790
Okay.

1925
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:04,770
Let's 3v1 this.

1926
01:36:05,650 --> 01:36:07,130
There's no way we could lose.

1927
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:09,670
We're literally 3v1ing.

1928
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:10,790
How could we lose this?

1929
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:14,850
Okay, nice.

1930
01:36:18,150 --> 01:36:18,710
Nice.

1931
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:19,130
Come on.

1932
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:20,870
You're so close to dying.

1933
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:23,870
You don't even have an actual model.

1934
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:27,990
Your model is default general 3.

1935
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:31,030
Okay, nice.

1936
01:36:31,570 --> 01:36:32,550
My base now.

1937
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:35,910
Alright, now we just need to...

1938
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:36,270
Go!

1939
01:36:37,110 --> 01:36:37,650
Freedom!

1940
01:36:39,530 --> 01:36:39,870
Okay.

1941
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:40,770
Let's cheer.

1942
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:41,210
Come on.

1943
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:42,170
Go, Birch, go!

1944
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:43,490
Go!

1945
01:36:43,650 --> 01:36:45,130
With power and motivation!

1946
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:46,250
Go, Birch, go!

1947
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:48,570
Come on!

1948
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:49,410
Motivating!

1949
01:36:50,790 --> 01:36:51,090
Okay.

1950
01:36:56,890 --> 01:36:57,970
All your...

1951
01:36:57,970 --> 01:36:59,390
Okay, so I think you have no...

1952
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:01,210
You actually have no choice in that matter.

1953
01:37:01,330 --> 01:37:02,570
You might as well just...

1954
01:37:02,570 --> 01:37:03,910
Just give up now.

1955
01:37:04,710 --> 01:37:05,870
I have...

1956
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:12,730
All I'm saying is that...

1957
01:37:12,730 --> 01:37:13,610
OH SHIT!

1958
01:37:14,170 --> 01:37:15,290
OH MY GOD!

1959
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:19,930
He fucking grabbed me!

1960
01:37:20,690 --> 01:37:25,050
But all I'm saying is that maybe if you also recruited...

1961
01:37:25,050 --> 01:37:27,730
Okay, I shouldn't say that.

1962
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:38,130
It did change the title more.

1963
01:37:38,570 --> 01:37:39,910
That's all I'm saying.

1964
01:37:43,590 --> 01:37:44,470
Alright, nice.

1965
01:37:45,510 --> 01:37:46,770
My base now.

1966
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:48,310
Yeah!

1967
01:37:53,390 --> 01:37:55,310
We did it, guys!

1968
01:37:55,670 --> 01:37:56,730
We did it!

1969
01:37:57,510 --> 01:37:59,790
Can't argue with ourselves!

1970
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:03,890
We did it!

1971
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:04,970
We stopped the rebellion!

1972
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:09,750
Alright, we gotta level up our wheels.

1973
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:12,290
Throw your wheels upward after a set amount of time.

1974
01:38:12,370 --> 01:38:13,650
They will fall from above and...

1975
01:38:14,030 --> 01:38:15,090
Jesus Christ!

1976
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:16,110
Don't look up!

1977
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:20,010
Eh...

1978
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:21,910
Oh, I almost unlocked a new skill.

1979
01:38:24,070 --> 01:38:24,990
Oh, Birch!

1980
01:38:25,850 --> 01:38:28,250
You're gonna get stronger soon, Birch!

1981
01:38:31,490 --> 01:38:32,730
Wait, there's rage mode?

1982
01:38:33,890 --> 01:38:36,470
Wait a minute, how do I get into rage mode again?

1983
01:38:37,210 --> 01:38:40,430
I don't remember how to get into rage...

1984
01:38:40,430 --> 01:38:42,470
Oh, it's when I press the two buttons together!

1985
01:38:42,590 --> 01:38:42,910
Okay, wait.

1986
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:43,750
I remember now.

1987
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:44,990
JK, I remember.

1988
01:38:47,410 --> 01:38:47,970
Uh...

1989
01:38:47,970 --> 01:38:48,630
Let's see...

1990
01:38:48,630 --> 01:38:50,370
This is the position when you activate eyes.

1991
01:38:51,310 --> 01:38:51,650
Okay.

1992
01:38:53,830 --> 01:38:55,190
Nevermind, I remember now.

1993
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:58,310
I almost forgot how to get into God of War mode.

1994
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:03,800
Hello?

1995
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:07,820
Hey, guys!

1996
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:10,940
We did it!

1997
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:12,200
We won with a coughing baby!

1998
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:47,160
We did it!

1999
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:47,660
We're like, you know...

2000
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:50,040
We'll wait a week until another rebellion shows up.

2001
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,820
You know, during the Three Kingdoms era, it was not really considered peaceful.

2002
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:10,060
Oh, thanks guys!

2003
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:11,080
I mean, yeah.

2004
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,800
I did kill 90% of the people there.

2005
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:15,980
But yeah, no, credit the warrior princess!

2006
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:18,340
Yeah!

2007
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:19,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2008
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:20,200
Credit her!

2009
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:21,980
Who only killed one guy.

2010
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:37,820
I don't have that luxury.

2011
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:41,920
I'm sorry, Miss Warrior Princess who descended from royalty.

2012
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:47,300
You see, you fight as a hobby.

2013
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:49,160
I get paid to fight.

2014
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:52,760
You're right.

2015
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:53,380
Of course not.

2016
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:57,340
I wish I'd had that same mentality from the start.

2017
01:40:58,460 --> 01:41:01,320
I've always approached battles seriously.

2018
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:03,980
And yet...

2019
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:07,360
I'm still finding it difficult to keep my composure.

2020
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:08,200
You're right!

2021
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:09,780
Sorry.

2022
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:14,280
Every single arrow...

2023
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:15,720
is aiming.

2024
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:17,100
Oh shit, sorry.

2025
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:24,160
Okay.

2026
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:24,780
Oh shit!

2027
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:26,820
Like fear in a child?

2028
01:41:42,620 --> 01:41:43,980
Please, no!

2029
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:44,740
Wait!

2030
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:56,060
I was a bit...

2031
01:41:56,060 --> 01:41:57,360
No, we are not worried about her.

2032
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:02,360
We were not worried about her, guys.

2033
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:03,340
We're not.

2034
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:04,440
We're not.

2035
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:19,880
Man, this sucks.

2036
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:21,540
You're just going to get married off later.

2037
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:22,700
Man, this sucks.

2038
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:46,360
I look forward to see...

2039
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,080
I'm worried about...

2040
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:48,420
No, we are not worried about her.

2041
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:51,300
We're not worried about her.

2042
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:56,060
That's not supposed to be anything flirtatious!

2043
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:59,400
I was just motivating you!

2044
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,640
Don't giggle at me!

2045
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,340
Don't giggle at me!

2046
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:13,200
Oh my god.

2047
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:16,820
Okay, weapon shop.

2048
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:19,340
Oh, it's the same thing.

2049
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:20,600
I already have all of this.

2050
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:23,120
Oh wait, I have letters.

2051
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:24,640
Absolutely.

2052
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:26,160
Thank you for the super chat.

2053
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:27,340
Thank you, thank you.

2054
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,480
Why is he...

2055
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:33,620
I keep forgetting he exists.

2056
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:37,320
Like...

2057
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:37,480
What's happening?

2058
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:38,980
He's just like...

2059
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:41,460
Beside me or some shit.

2060
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:44,580
I hate forgetting about it.

2061
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,320
I already forgot about this guy's existence.

2062
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:48,700
In this game.

2063
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:54,720
Alright.

2064
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:56,900
Oh, he sent me a letter.

2065
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:58,480
You're next to me!

2066
01:43:59,020 --> 01:44:00,960
Why did you send me a letter?

2067
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:03,420
You just...

2068
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:04,780
Talked to me!

2069
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:11,440
Not jokey.

2070
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:12,880
Excuse me for being...

2071
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,940
It's like when someone texts you...

2072
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:16,120
And they're sitting next to you.

2073
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:19,940
And they text you about your life.

2074
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:21,100
Hey, can you do the dishes?

2075
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:26,680
But what exactly...

2076
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:28,660
Is your relationship with the princess?

2077
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:30,160
Oh my god!

2078
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:31,440
She's a child!

2079
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:38,460
We are the princess!

2080
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:40,640
We would climb...

2081
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:43,560
Any mountain...

2082
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:44,840
For her and...

2083
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:46,020
Oh my god, it's her!

2084
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:48,880
Oh my god, it's her sims!

2085
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:50,900
We would climb any mountain...

2086
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:52,540
For her and any river...

2087
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:54,460
And charge across any battlefield...

2088
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:57,720
To watch over and support her.

2089
01:44:58,100 --> 01:45:01,720
Just because you're a little more suave than us...

2090
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:02,780
Doesn't mean...

2091
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:05,120
You can get ahead so easily.

2092
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:07,800
I just said good luck!

2093
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:08,580
I...

2094
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:13,060
Besides...

2095
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:15,980
When men like her brother and lord joe urm...

2096
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:18,880
The princess is used to good looking fellas.

2097
01:45:19,420 --> 01:45:20,540
Or should be.

2098
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:21,960
Or she should be.

2099
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:24,300
Anyway, if we wish to join our cadre...

2100
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:25,080
Then take this.

2101
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:27,980
It's something that all her members of her card...

2102
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:29,040
Carry with them.

2103
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,460
Oh my god, please!

2104
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:32,760
It was just a collab!

2105
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:34,160
I swear!

2106
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:35,720
We're just...

2107
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:37,800
I got paid...

2108
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:39,160
To work with them!

2109
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:40,140
I swear!

2110
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:47,420
Increase your defense by 200% for a limited time.

2111
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:50,600
Golden Foxy, thank you for the super chat.

2112
01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:52,180
Thank you, thank you.

2113
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:53,200
Thank you.

2114
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:56,260
I'm gonna need you to take a seat over there.

2115
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:00,760
Yuan Hua.

2116
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:01,380
Hello.

2117
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:28,520
I'm right beside you, just tell me!

2118
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:31,540
You can literally just tell me!

2119
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:36,280
Okay, I have the Scorch Gems.

2120
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:37,120
Boost damage to...

2121
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:39,600
Okay, but I always do parry, so like...

2122
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,380
I don't have to worry about it.

2123
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:42,760
Oh my god.

2124
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:45,480
Oh my god, I want...

2125
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:48,060
Please give me back the general route.

2126
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:50,260
Please, get me out of the princess route!

2127
01:46:50,660 --> 01:46:53,280
Get me out of the princess route!

2128
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:56,120
I don't want to be here anymore!

2129
01:47:02,630 --> 01:47:04,950
I don't think he wants to talk.

2130
01:47:06,510 --> 01:47:07,830
Alright, let's see.

2131
01:47:08,230 --> 01:47:08,850
Who's he?

2132
01:47:09,410 --> 01:47:10,050
Who are you?

2133
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:17,310
Is that Gan Ning?

2134
01:47:27,090 --> 01:47:28,630
Can I help you?

2135
01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:29,690
You've been looking for me?

2136
01:47:35,290 --> 01:47:35,590
Me?

2137
01:47:43,970 --> 01:47:50,050
Oh, it's Gan Ning!

2138
01:47:51,010 --> 01:47:53,170
Wait, where's his mohawk?

2139
01:48:08,790 --> 01:48:11,570
Damn, those tattoos go fucking hard.

2140
01:48:15,530 --> 01:48:18,110
Okay, not gonna lie...

2141
01:48:18,110 --> 01:48:20,850
Okay, Gan Ning...

2142
01:48:20,850 --> 01:48:22,230
His older design...

2143
01:48:22,230 --> 01:48:23,210
Okay, I'm gonna...

2144
01:48:23,210 --> 01:48:25,430
I actually like his older design a lot more.

2145
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:31,130
He had like...

2146
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:34,050
Okay, his older design was actually fucking crazy.

2147
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:34,570
Like...

2148
01:48:35,470 --> 01:48:38,050
Gan Ning's older design was like...

2149
01:48:38,050 --> 01:48:40,290
He was like, yeah, I'm a bad boy.

2150
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:43,210
So...

2151
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:45,190
It was more like...

2152
01:48:45,190 --> 01:48:47,410
He was way cooler.

2153
01:48:47,610 --> 01:48:48,990
He was so much cooler.

2154
01:48:49,190 --> 01:48:50,790
Okay, let me show you guys his older design.

2155
01:48:51,350 --> 01:48:54,050
It's so weird, it's so weird seeing him like...

2156
01:48:54,910 --> 01:48:56,510
Not be a bad boy anymore.

2157
01:48:56,650 --> 01:48:57,310
I don't know!

2158
01:48:57,730 --> 01:49:00,030
I mean like, I guess he has tattoos.

2159
01:49:00,790 --> 01:49:02,050
But like, he was...

2160
01:49:02,050 --> 01:49:03,550
Yeah, he was like...

2161
01:49:03,550 --> 01:49:05,030
Okay, here's his older design.

2162
01:49:05,130 --> 01:49:05,770
I'll show you guys.

2163
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:08,630
Alright, this was...

2164
01:49:08,630 --> 01:49:10,650
This one, to me, was his peak.

2165
01:49:11,010 --> 01:49:12,990
I think this one was his best design.

2166
01:49:13,090 --> 01:49:14,050
So, overall.

2167
01:49:14,650 --> 01:49:16,250
I honestly think...

2168
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:19,210
And then his voice was like super gravelly.

2169
01:49:19,710 --> 01:49:22,510
His voice was like incredibly gravelly.

2170
01:49:22,730 --> 01:49:23,950
And like...

2171
01:49:23,950 --> 01:49:24,730
Like...

2172
01:49:24,730 --> 01:49:26,570
Horse and stuff like that.

2173
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:27,810
And he would have like...

2174
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:29,070
Yeah, that one was peak.

2175
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:31,590
Then they like redesigned him to look like this.

2176
01:49:31,690 --> 01:49:33,290
And I was like, oh, that's alright.

2177
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:35,490
Like, he still looks cool.

2178
01:49:35,890 --> 01:49:38,130
But like, this design...

2179
01:49:38,130 --> 01:49:39,690
This was peak Gan Ning.

2180
01:49:39,830 --> 01:49:40,310
I think.

2181
01:49:40,330 --> 01:49:42,170
I think this one was my favorite.

2182
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:48,310
I think...

2183
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:52,010
I think this one was peak Gan Ning design.

2184
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:53,810
When they had their...

2185
01:49:54,470 --> 01:49:54,910
Yeah.

2186
01:49:54,910 --> 01:49:56,750
And he was like...

2187
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:57,330
His like...

2188
01:49:57,330 --> 01:50:00,770
His voice was like super gravelly, too.

2189
01:50:01,110 --> 01:50:03,130
Yeah, that one was good.

2190
01:50:04,310 --> 01:50:06,310
Alright, now he's like...

2191
01:50:06,310 --> 01:50:08,350
Now he's like, I could be bad.

2192
01:50:20,450 --> 01:50:22,390
He's like semi-bad.

2193
01:50:29,350 --> 01:50:30,190
He's like...

2194
01:50:30,190 --> 01:50:30,410
He's like boy -bad.

2195
01:50:30,510 --> 01:50:31,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2196
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:32,430
He's like...

2197
01:50:32,430 --> 01:50:33,410
PG-bad.

2198
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:47,730
Flock together?

2199
01:50:59,490 --> 01:51:00,730
Oh my god.

2200
01:51:00,730 --> 01:51:01,730
Oh my god, he is so boy-bad.

2201
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:05,130
It's like sterilized...

2202
01:51:05,130 --> 01:51:05,990
Bad boy.

2203
01:51:09,450 --> 01:51:10,490
They're like...

2204
01:51:10,490 --> 01:51:11,150
We gotta be on...

2205
01:51:11,150 --> 01:51:15,810
We gotta be on Cartoon Network, guys.

2206
01:51:15,810 --> 01:51:15,890
Yes.

2207
01:51:22,170 --> 01:51:24,730
He's got one singular bell.

2208
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:31,770
Why does he have one singular bell?

2209
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:37,890
Oh my god!

2210
01:51:38,090 --> 01:51:38,630
Oh yeah.

2211
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:45,810
He has one singular bell.

2212
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:51,320
Alright.

2213
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:57,900
Looks like you're taking a liking to my hideout.

2214
01:51:58,140 --> 01:51:58,680
What?

2215
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:01,360
Wait, what?

2216
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:03,440
Did he took me to the hideout?

2217
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:05,220
And then fade to black?

2218
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:06,380
What do we do?

2219
01:52:06,940 --> 01:52:10,520
What did we do?

2220
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:12,760
Why did I take a liking?

2221
01:52:15,340 --> 01:52:16,260
Oh no.

2222
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:18,020
No, not the off-screen.

2223
01:52:20,780 --> 01:52:21,860
Oh no.

2224
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:25,080
Come see me again once you train up some more.

2225
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:29,080
Oh my god, what did I do?

2226
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:32,880
I know what... I know!

2227
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:33,900
What do you think of this?

2228
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:35,460
Okay.

2229
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:39,480
You giving it all makes me feel like I can do likewise.

2230
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:46,220
There is a favor I wish to ask of you.

2231
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:48,860
Will you help us maintain order in Changsha?

2232
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:50,800
I'll pay you for your troubles, of course.

2233
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:52,460
Wait, this?

2234
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:56,360
Offers you can get rewards for completing...

2235
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:56,780
Oh, okay.

2236
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:57,900
I mean, it's just right there.

2237
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:01,800
No, we have yet to...

2238
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:02,600
I don't...

2239
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:05,160
It takes so long to pursue one Lu Bu.

2240
01:53:06,860 --> 01:53:09,440
I'm surprised we haven't pursued him yet.

2241
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,320
I'm just as surprised as you guys.

2242
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:18,480
Instead, I have to babysit a child who has a fucking crush on me.

2243
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:22,600
Okay, get him out of here.

2244
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:23,820
Get this bandit.

2245
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:25,820
Nice.

2246
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:29,200
Get out of here.

2247
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:30,160
Give me that base.

2248
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:34,600
Is there another officer here?

2249
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:35,800
No, I killed all the officers.

2250
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:38,880
Okay.

2251
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:42,440
Nice.

2252
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:47,140
Nice, my base now.

2253
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:49,280
Alright, I'll get this other base.

2254
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:50,720
This other base would be fast.

2255
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:52,980
Alright, go, go horse, go!

2256
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:56,580
They say you're the strongest horse out there.

2257
01:53:57,900 --> 01:53:59,400
Come on, get up, get up!

2258
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:01,080
Cheer on, I'm cheering you on!

2259
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:02,160
You got this!

2260
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:04,540
Nice.

2261
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:06,920
That parry was so good.

2262
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:08,640
That was like an instant parry.

2263
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:10,860
I literally got off my horse and I parried instantly.

2264
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:14,760
Nice.

2265
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:15,980
Get out!

2266
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:18,420
Okay, now I just need to beat up the little guys.

2267
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:20,980
Yeah, that's right.

2268
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:23,660
That's right!

2269
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:25,000
Your leader's dead!

2270
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,240
I killed him and I ate him!

2271
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:29,320
Because we have a famine right now.

2272
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:32,400
Back in ye olde dynasty times.

2273
01:54:32,940 --> 01:54:36,720
I don't know if you guys know that, but like back in the Three Kingdoms era, there was a lot of famine.

2274
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:43,260
There was a lot of famine back then.

2275
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:46,160
We gotta eat what we can get.

2276
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:52,560
Yeah, what do you think the meat and the meat buns were?

2277
01:54:56,230 --> 01:54:58,190
Yeah, there was a lot of...

2278
01:54:58,190 --> 01:55:00,570
A lot of cannibalism, surprisingly.

2279
01:55:06,270 --> 01:55:09,510
Surprisingly, a lot of cannibalism.

2280
01:55:12,750 --> 01:55:13,230
Yay!

2281
01:55:13,610 --> 01:55:15,110
Here, take this as a token of my gratitude.

2282
01:55:15,310 --> 01:55:16,970
I hope that I may call upon you again.

2283
01:55:17,610 --> 01:55:18,490
Get a strength potion.

2284
01:55:18,910 --> 01:55:21,530
Oh, I have to go backwards.

2285
01:55:22,910 --> 01:55:23,850
Oh, I have a letter?

2286
01:55:24,730 --> 01:55:25,130
You sent me a letter?

2287
01:55:25,510 --> 01:55:26,610
You sent me a letter.

2288
01:55:29,350 --> 01:55:31,370
Hello, my doctor that does nothing.

2289
01:55:33,850 --> 01:55:35,610
Yellow turban, remnant, heading on.

2290
01:55:35,950 --> 01:55:41,230
It was after you, a traveling warrior, had beat me down that it dawned to me what in the world was I doing?

2291
01:55:41,570 --> 01:55:43,650
I had a family, a home that I needed to protect.

2292
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:47,050
And yet, I'd thrown it all away in these chaotic times.

2293
01:55:47,530 --> 01:55:48,750
You and I were alike.

2294
01:55:49,210 --> 01:55:54,170
While possessions are renowned, I had become abandoned, and you went on to save others and earn their gratitude.

2295
01:55:54,590 --> 01:55:56,230
I suddenly felt ashamed.

2296
01:55:56,850 --> 01:55:58,970
I felt a longing for home.

2297
01:55:59,430 --> 01:56:03,330
Please, take this so I can use my hands to hug my family when I see them again.

2298
01:56:03,770 --> 01:56:05,430
If they forgive me.

2299
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:06,670
Thank you for the super chat.

2300
01:56:06,770 --> 01:56:08,450
Thank you, thank you, yellow turban, remnant.

2301
01:56:09,230 --> 01:56:10,690
It's great to have a fan.

2302
01:56:11,690 --> 01:56:12,210
Finally!

2303
01:56:14,030 --> 01:56:14,550
Finally!

2304
01:56:14,690 --> 01:56:17,850
A Dragoon fan I didn't accidentally kill in war.

2305
01:56:19,490 --> 01:56:20,010
Alright.

2306
01:56:20,010 --> 01:56:21,050
Alright, let's go this way.

2307
01:56:23,190 --> 01:56:23,710
Alright.

2308
01:56:24,650 --> 01:56:26,610
Time to go across the ocean.

2309
01:56:27,330 --> 01:56:28,370
The slowest boat ride.

2310
01:56:28,510 --> 01:56:28,810
Okay, nevermind.

2311
01:56:28,870 --> 01:56:29,510
I'll just accelerate.

2312
01:56:30,010 --> 01:56:33,590
I was gonna be like, this is such a fucking slow boat ride.

2313
01:56:33,990 --> 01:56:34,330
Yeah!

2314
01:56:35,770 --> 01:56:36,710
Hey, Chen Pu.

2315
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:38,370
What are you doing here?

2316
01:56:41,410 --> 01:56:42,250
Oh no.

2317
01:56:43,950 --> 01:56:44,990
It's me!

2318
01:56:48,150 --> 01:56:49,310
I know of you.

2319
01:56:49,410 --> 01:56:52,270
Because I serve as an advisor to Lord Sun Jian.

2320
01:56:53,610 --> 01:56:59,850
I see that you are using your time between battles not to rest but to sharpen your skills.

2321
01:57:00,910 --> 01:57:05,110
Lord Sun Jian, Huang Gai, and even the princess have gotten quite worked up.

2322
01:57:05,110 --> 01:57:05,890
Oh no, no, no.

2323
01:57:06,010 --> 01:57:06,750
Remove that part.

2324
01:57:06,790 --> 01:57:07,470
The last part.

2325
01:57:07,890 --> 01:57:08,490
There's clearly a reason for that.

2326
01:57:10,930 --> 01:57:13,270
Okay, but what did they say?

2327
01:57:13,630 --> 01:57:16,830
They all possess a strange fondness Oh!

2328
01:57:17,110 --> 01:57:18,450
No, no, no, no.

2329
01:57:18,870 --> 01:57:20,150
No, no, no!

2330
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:21,970
No, no, no, no, no!

2331
01:57:34,910 --> 01:57:37,530
Why does it keep getting worse?!

2332
01:57:53,430 --> 01:57:55,770
No, it's okay.

2333
01:57:55,970 --> 01:57:57,630
I know which faction I'm not joining.

2334
01:57:57,850 --> 01:58:01,190
I know which faction I'm not joining.

2335
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:07,600
It would be an honor.

2336
01:58:07,900 --> 01:58:10,020
I need time to prepare.

2337
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:15,580
Wait, is he actually inviting me to his faction?

2338
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,680
Oh, fuck!

2339
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:18,460
Fuck, okay!

2340
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,260
Oh no, oh no!

2341
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:27,820
Oh, it's just a side quest?

2342
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:28,820
Okay, thank god.

2343
01:58:29,220 --> 01:58:30,300
Oh, thank god.

2344
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:32,520
It's just a side quest.

2345
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:34,660
Okay, I was gonna say I'm not...

2346
01:58:34,660 --> 01:58:37,540
I need to get far away from the Sun Clan.

2347
01:58:51,820 --> 01:58:52,700
For now.

2348
01:58:58,420 --> 01:58:59,300
Challenge me?

2349
01:59:01,940 --> 01:59:02,900
Seems I have no choice.

2350
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:04,520
Okay, thank you for the super chat!

2351
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:05,700
Your very first super chat!

2352
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:06,680
Thank you!

2353
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:09,780
Tomorrow's my birthday, so I thought I might spread some love.

2354
01:59:09,860 --> 01:59:11,300
Oh my god, thank you!

2355
01:59:11,420 --> 01:59:14,300
Thank you for super chatting on your birthday to me!

2356
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:15,380
I really appreciate it!

2357
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:18,660
I'll give you a birthday song now because I don't think I'm streaming tomorrow.

2358
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:20,280
Happy birthday to you!

2359
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:22,200
Happy birthday to you!

2360
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:24,320
Happy birthday dear MLK!

2361
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:26,120
Happy birthday to you!

2362
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:26,640
Yeah!

2363
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:27,740
Happy birthday!

2364
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:31,300
Oh, am I gonna beat up an old man?

2365
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:39,100
Alright, old man.

2366
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:41,900
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

2367
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:44,560
Oh, okay.

2368
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:45,260
I guess not.

2369
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:45,440
Alright.

2370
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:47,660
Alright, goodbye.

2371
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:49,420
Okay.

2372
01:59:52,220 --> 01:59:52,380
Alright.

2373
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:53,360
Alright.

2374
01:59:55,060 --> 01:59:55,620
We fight.

2375
02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:03,680
Oh yes!

2376
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:06,180
We are unlocking the...

2377
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:08,620
There we go.

2378
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:11,440
That's fucking right.

2379
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:12,200
That's it?

2380
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:14,480
Oh man.

2381
02:00:15,180 --> 02:00:17,120
That's a little embarrassing for you.

2382
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:21,140
That is so embarrassing for you right there.

2383
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:22,320
Like, really?

2384
02:00:22,940 --> 02:00:25,580
You got parried twice, buddy!

2385
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:29,060
You got parried twice!

2386
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:34,520
Bro, you're already tired?

2387
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:36,980
What the fuck is your stamina?

2388
02:00:38,860 --> 02:00:41,160
How are you... Oh my god, he can parry too?

2389
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:46,360
What's he gonna say?

2390
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:47,740
That's crazy.

2391
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:49,040
How is my...

2392
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:51,260
Your spirit has roused.

2393
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:55,060
How is there moral for this one?

2394
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,560
It's just you and me.

2395
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:02,300
That's fucking right.

2396
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:04,080
There we go.

2397
02:01:04,540 --> 02:01:06,840
Guys, you haven't even got one hit on me, bro.

2398
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:10,480
Like, no wonder you're just an advisor.

2399
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:14,100
Like, stay in your lane, Chenpoo.

2400
02:01:14,620 --> 02:01:16,960
Stay in your fucking lane.

2401
02:01:17,540 --> 02:01:20,660
This is embarrassing, even for...

2402
02:01:20,660 --> 02:01:22,320
This is so embarrassing.

2403
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:27,620
Literally no damage run.

2404
02:01:29,260 --> 02:01:30,740
Get out of my elo.

2405
02:01:31,140 --> 02:01:32,480
Go back into your...

2406
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:34,220
Go back into your locker, nerd.

2407
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:40,320
He's not in his prime anymore, Doki.

2408
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:46,780
Nice, I got parried too.

2409
02:01:53,980 --> 02:01:57,000
From you need to generic general.

2410
02:01:57,720 --> 02:02:01,340
Yeah, go back to generic general.

2411
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:04,520
Who gave you a design, Chenpoo?

2412
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,360
You used to be a nobody.

2413
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:08,500
Maybe you should stay a nobody.

2414
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:10,500
Alright.

2415
02:02:11,100 --> 02:02:11,600
Hmm.

2416
02:02:12,460 --> 02:02:17,760
You show skill, and not one silver hesitation or mercy.

2417
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:23,520
No less fearsome than Honggai or Hongdang.

2418
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:26,000
Oh, woah, woah, woah!

2419
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:29,740
I look forward to the day you choose to fight under Lord Sun Jian's banner.

2420
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:31,840
And feel free to come and train anytime.

2421
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:33,640
I'll be happy to spar you.

2422
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:36,480
You're not even a fucking challenge, buddy.

2423
02:02:37,260 --> 02:02:40,380
What do you mean you'd be happy to spar me?

2424
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:46,480
I'm still not the right level for this guy.

2425
02:02:59,860 --> 02:03:02,840
Okay, wait, what's this?

2426
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:03,720
Is this weapons?

2427
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:05,900
Okay, any new weapons, though?

2428
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:09,540
Nah, just bad weapons.

2429
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:12,240
Oh wait, there's items here, though.

2430
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:16,800
He meant be a looting punching bag.

2431
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:18,200
I mean, basically, yeah.

2432
02:03:18,540 --> 02:03:19,400
Not gonna lie.

2433
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:20,940
Alright, board.

2434
02:03:25,870 --> 02:03:26,610
Okay, nice.

2435
02:03:26,710 --> 02:03:27,330
I need that.

2436
02:03:28,050 --> 02:03:30,150
Jesus, so far—oh, I should've just fast-traveled.

2437
02:03:32,890 --> 02:03:34,030
Hey, this is open now.

2438
02:03:35,570 --> 02:03:37,070
Wait, no, this was open always.

2439
02:03:38,790 --> 02:03:43,010
I got— I completed all your requests, John Fae.

2440
02:03:57,850 --> 02:04:00,450
Wait, is this a date?

2441
02:04:03,970 --> 02:04:04,930
Would you like to join?

2442
02:04:06,790 --> 02:04:08,130
Oh my god!

2443
02:04:08,130 --> 02:04:10,230
Oh my god!

2444
02:04:10,470 --> 02:04:11,390
John Fae, you're out!

2445
02:04:11,490 --> 02:04:11,810
Okay.

2446
02:04:12,330 --> 02:04:14,410
Would you like to join me?

2447
02:04:18,150 --> 02:04:20,930
A lunch date with John Fae?

2448
02:04:27,770 --> 02:04:29,730
I'm not just no one, though.

2449
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:39,870
My brothers seem to like you.

2450
02:04:41,030 --> 02:04:42,410
And even I.

2451
02:04:43,690 --> 02:04:45,510
Woah, woah!

2452
02:04:46,030 --> 02:04:48,110
You know what?

2453
02:04:48,610 --> 02:04:49,610
You know what?

2454
02:04:50,030 --> 02:04:57,290
You know— You can say like me as a brother, right?

2455
02:04:57,790 --> 02:04:59,190
Go on.

2456
02:05:03,850 --> 02:05:05,330
Go on, John.

2457
02:05:05,330 --> 02:05:07,330
Oh my god, he's a sinner.

2458
02:05:11,750 --> 02:05:13,190
Oh, what?

2459
02:05:17,590 --> 02:05:18,510
Damn!

2460
02:05:31,090 --> 02:05:32,010
Woah!

2461
02:05:37,690 --> 02:05:41,070
Oh my god, you're right, I get three big brothers!

2462
02:05:43,330 --> 02:05:45,250
And no princess.

2463
02:05:51,930 --> 02:05:55,170
You have— You're trying to win me over!

2464
02:05:55,610 --> 02:05:57,150
What are these choices?

2465
02:05:58,230 --> 02:05:59,750
Why do you keep doing this?

2466
02:06:00,010 --> 02:06:03,290
Why do you keep doing bros before hos?

2467
02:06:03,290 --> 02:06:06,570
Like I said, bros before hos.

2468
02:06:06,950 --> 02:06:08,710
Thank you for the superchat.

2469
02:06:08,870 --> 02:06:09,870
Thank you, thank you.

2470
02:06:10,190 --> 02:06:13,250
This is why it's called romance of the three kings.

2471
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:15,330
Oh!

2472
02:06:15,790 --> 02:06:17,390
Oh my god, confirmation!

2473
02:06:21,650 --> 02:06:24,030
You have a problem with it?

2474
02:06:25,710 --> 02:06:26,650
Oh my god.

2475
02:06:33,370 --> 02:06:34,590
Oh my god, I'm in!

2476
02:06:35,390 --> 02:06:36,070
I'm in!

2477
02:06:37,130 --> 02:06:42,110
Oh my god, I'm gonna get the exclusive wallpaper for unlocking Israel!

2478
02:06:43,310 --> 02:06:45,650
I'm gonna get the visual!

2479
02:06:47,130 --> 02:06:48,830
I'm gonna unlock the visual!

2480
02:06:51,010 --> 02:06:53,150
Oh my god, we need a fourth brother!

2481
02:07:00,090 --> 02:07:00,850
Brothers?

2482
02:07:04,370 --> 02:07:07,290
I told you, they wrote me out of history.

2483
02:07:15,070 --> 02:07:15,710
Bro.

2484
02:07:24,950 --> 02:07:26,590
Oh my god.

2485
02:07:27,070 --> 02:07:30,870
Guys, I'm gonna unlock the visual image for completing the route.

2486
02:07:32,930 --> 02:07:33,930
I'm gonna do it.

2487
02:07:34,110 --> 02:07:34,670
Oh my god.

2488
02:07:38,590 --> 02:07:39,150
I knew it.

2489
02:07:39,170 --> 02:07:40,470
I knew they rewrote.

2490
02:07:40,590 --> 02:07:42,250
They wrote me out of history.

2491
02:07:42,810 --> 02:07:45,350
I knew I was always meant to be the fourth brother.

2492
02:07:53,070 --> 02:07:55,770
So what happened after the train?

2493
02:08:00,030 --> 02:08:01,070
Who are you?

2494
02:08:01,630 --> 02:08:02,390
Another route?

2495
02:08:03,770 --> 02:08:04,330
Yes?

2496
02:08:11,690 --> 02:08:13,350
Water Mirror?

2497
02:08:13,650 --> 02:08:14,310
Hermit?

2498
02:08:20,530 --> 02:08:22,550
I've always wanted a brother.

2499
02:08:33,230 --> 02:08:34,550
Okay.

2500
02:08:43,250 --> 02:08:43,930
What?

2501
02:08:46,430 --> 02:08:48,130
I have no memories.

2502
02:08:50,130 --> 02:08:52,590
I hit my head and then here I am.

2503
02:08:54,490 --> 02:08:59,070
Not every big, goofy man wants to fade to black with me.

2504
02:09:01,490 --> 02:09:03,030
More than meets the eye.

2505
02:09:11,690 --> 02:09:18,030
share local rumors and possibly even introduce you to other visitors.

2506
02:09:18,250 --> 02:09:18,870
Other visitors?

2507
02:09:19,350 --> 02:09:20,970
Other realms?

2508
02:09:21,330 --> 02:09:26,090
Did you also got the incense from my child doctor?

2509
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:33,880
Wow.

2510
02:09:37,360 --> 02:09:40,440
Alright, now that I'm here, I go out.

2511
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:46,040
Like, what does he do?

2512
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:53,740
Oh, where you can see information about your relationships?

2513
02:09:54,300 --> 02:09:58,620
What does that mean?

2514
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,740
What does that mean?

2515
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:08,360
I'm gonna start receiving date gifts?

2516
02:10:09,740 --> 02:10:10,460
Okay.

2517
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:15,120
Hi, I know of you.

2518
02:10:15,260 --> 02:10:16,360
Welcome to my dwelling.

2519
02:10:17,860 --> 02:10:19,160
I believe this is your name?

2520
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:22,120
A warrior of superb judgment and bold actions.

2521
02:10:22,300 --> 02:10:26,280
Countless soldiers owe their lives to his sharp eye and gallantry.

2522
02:10:27,140 --> 02:10:28,740
I've heard tales of your exploits.

2523
02:10:29,680 --> 02:10:31,860
Many a valiant warrior is taking notice of you.

2524
02:10:33,120 --> 02:10:36,760
The bond you forge with him may prove to be waymarks guiding your path.

2525
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:44,200
Your visit to this place will also be of help, as I have to teach you the bonds between yourself and the heroes of this land.

2526
02:10:44,640 --> 02:10:45,820
Alright, alright.

2527
02:10:45,820 --> 02:10:49,220
Now, let's see if I can introduce someone you can befriend.

2528
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:53,180
Let me befriend Dong Zhuo.

2529
02:10:53,540 --> 02:10:54,060
Alright.

2530
02:10:56,560 --> 02:10:57,520
Okay.

2531
02:10:58,060 --> 02:10:59,160
Where are my bonds?

2532
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:02,000
Oh, my level three.

2533
02:11:02,220 --> 02:11:05,100
My level three bond.

2534
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:06,620
Okay.

2535
02:11:07,780 --> 02:11:08,740
Okay.

2536
02:11:11,140 --> 02:11:12,100
Okay.

2537
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:12,420
Yeah.

2538
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:17,560
Alright, I also have a level three with John Fei.

2539
02:11:18,420 --> 02:11:20,660
I'm just in an acquaintance with Chen.

2540
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:21,740
Oh, he's dead anyway.

2541
02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:26,380
Okay, at least he's dead.

2542
02:11:26,860 --> 02:11:27,180
Okay.

2543
02:11:28,760 --> 02:11:29,400
Alright.

2544
02:11:31,060 --> 02:11:32,360
Not so bad.

2545
02:11:40,300 --> 02:11:46,120
I like how they make it a handshake, but it's like...

2546
02:11:46,120 --> 02:11:48,600
We all know it's sort of shaped like a heart.

2547
02:11:53,420 --> 02:11:57,020
It's a handshake, but yet somehow, it looks so much like a heart.

2548
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:01,180
These coins are no longer used as money, but they remain a token of good fortune.

2549
02:12:01,700 --> 02:12:02,780
Gift it to those close to you.

2550
02:12:02,860 --> 02:12:06,100
Receiving a coin from someone is a sign that the giver enjoys your company.

2551
02:12:06,660 --> 02:12:09,580
There are also coins that remain hidden in various places across the land.

2552
02:12:09,900 --> 02:12:12,500
Yet, they are somehow rediscovered.

2553
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:15,420
No, it was a handshake.

2554
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:20,300
Artifacts from ancient times once again in the hands of man after so many years.

2555
02:12:20,620 --> 02:12:21,320
Such a delay.

2556
02:12:22,020 --> 02:12:23,600
Hmm, that gives me an idea.

2557
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:26,060
Bring me any old coins you collect.

2558
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:29,860
I'll then give you something worthwhile in return based on how many you've brought.

2559
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:36,000
Old coins given to you are a testament of your bonds with others, and any coin you find yourself are proof of your travels.

2560
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:41,780
In other words, they signify the paths you've taken, and I, Chua Jin, shall reward your accomplishments.

2561
02:12:41,780 --> 02:12:42,500
Alright.

2562
02:12:42,980 --> 02:12:44,480
What do I- Can I get?

2563
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:46,300
Okay, reward.

2564
02:12:47,260 --> 02:12:48,880
Oh my god, that's a lot of rewards.

2565
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:50,460
Nice!

2566
02:12:51,620 --> 02:12:53,380
Ah, so your team- 10 coins!

2567
02:12:53,560 --> 02:12:54,320
Take this then.

2568
02:12:55,380 --> 02:12:56,680
Pretty sure I have more, right?

2569
02:12:59,140 --> 02:13:00,460
Nice, I got rocks.

2570
02:13:02,260 --> 02:13:02,660
Okay.

2571
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:04,860
So...

2572
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:08,540
Alright, so I can talk to Don Dua again.

2573
02:13:09,420 --> 02:13:10,160
Um...

2574
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:10,960
Alright.

2575
02:13:12,640 --> 02:13:14,660
Let me talk.

2576
02:13:16,640 --> 02:13:18,240
Where is he?

2577
02:13:18,460 --> 02:13:19,680
He's in the...

2578
02:13:19,680 --> 02:13:21,220
It starts with an S, right?

2579
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:25,400
Where is he?

2580
02:13:27,180 --> 02:13:28,500
Where's Don Dua?

2581
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:31,120
What province was he in again, guys?

2582
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:33,420
Uh...

2583
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:34,540
Romance?

2584
02:13:34,540 --> 02:13:36,220
That's odd.

2585
02:13:38,300 --> 02:13:40,040
Is he- He was here, right?

2586
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:41,640
He was in Liang province.

2587
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:44,900
I'm pretty sure.

2588
02:13:45,080 --> 02:13:45,900
Oh, there he is.

2589
02:13:47,240 --> 02:13:47,860
Hey, hey.

2590
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:49,360
Hey, hey.

2591
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,860
Well now, to think you go all the way to come and see me.

2592
02:13:54,100 --> 02:13:55,860
So you got guts to match your skills.

2593
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:59,620
Rejoice, for you are about to taste the sheer winds of Liang.

2594
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:02,260
I'll receive their quest.

2595
02:14:03,260 --> 02:14:04,020
What do I do?

2596
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:04,900
Is it this?

2597
02:14:07,780 --> 02:14:08,520
Or is it this?

2598
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:09,300
Oh, it's this!

2599
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:11,200
Quelling, okay.

2600
02:14:17,060 --> 02:14:19,020
Alright, he's about to give me the dong.

2601
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:23,720
I should not have said it like that.

2602
02:14:28,600 --> 02:14:31,620
Alright, get out of here.

2603
02:14:33,800 --> 02:14:35,000
Get out of here.

2604
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:36,120
Get out of here.

2605
02:14:36,120 --> 02:14:39,260
I realized what I said the moment it left my mouth.

2606
02:14:39,600 --> 02:14:39,900
I...

2607
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:41,080
I...

2608
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:45,120
I realized my mistakes.

2609
02:14:45,260 --> 02:14:46,300
Why are you running?

2610
02:14:47,240 --> 02:14:49,040
Oh, and then you ran back?

2611
02:14:51,180 --> 02:14:51,920
What am I doing?

2612
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,360
Let me meditate in front of you real quick.

2613
02:14:58,360 --> 02:15:01,440
Jesus Christ, this guy is very annoying though.

2614
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:04,280
Oh my god.

2615
02:15:05,080 --> 02:15:07,360
It's so hard because there's so many horses!

2616
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:09,380
Okay, goodbye.

2617
02:15:10,620 --> 02:15:11,120
It's fine.

2618
02:15:12,900 --> 02:15:13,220
Alright.

2619
02:15:14,220 --> 02:15:15,000
Get out of here.

2620
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:19,460
He like ran back just to get his horses.

2621
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:21,240
Oh shit.

2622
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:22,560
Nice.

2623
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:25,140
Okay.

2624
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:27,740
We should be able to get inside now, right?

2625
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:30,440
Let me in, let me in, let me in.

2626
02:15:31,100 --> 02:15:32,020
Let me in.

2627
02:15:32,620 --> 02:15:33,740
Do I not have enough allies?

2628
02:15:34,020 --> 02:15:34,560
Are they dead?

2629
02:15:34,740 --> 02:15:36,080
No, they're just horses.

2630
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:38,900
Alright, don't worry.

2631
02:15:39,800 --> 02:15:40,780
Horse me time.

2632
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:41,720
No more famine.

2633
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:44,900
Okay, now we should be able to open this door.

2634
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:48,280
Let me in.

2635
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:50,180
Get over here.

2636
02:15:51,140 --> 02:15:51,860
That's right.

2637
02:15:51,860 --> 02:15:54,180
Use that baton ram.

2638
02:15:54,540 --> 02:15:55,300
That's right!

2639
02:15:56,500 --> 02:15:56,520
Again!

2640
02:15:57,180 --> 02:15:57,860
And again!

2641
02:15:58,900 --> 02:15:59,640
There we go.

2642
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:00,760
Alright, I'm coming for you.

2643
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:03,060
I'm fucking coming for you.

2644
02:16:07,100 --> 02:16:08,360
That's fucking right.

2645
02:16:09,700 --> 02:16:11,100
Oh wait, I didn't...

2646
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:12,400
God damn it, I didn't parry that.

2647
02:16:13,720 --> 02:16:15,760
My entire strat relies on parry!

2648
02:16:17,340 --> 02:16:17,760
Okay.

2649
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:19,340
Easy.

2650
02:16:19,340 --> 02:16:19,500
Easy.

2651
02:16:20,120 --> 02:16:22,020
Alright, time to talk to the don.

2652
02:16:34,060 --> 02:16:34,540
Alright.

2653
02:16:40,590 --> 02:16:42,050
Plus three skill point, nice!

2654
02:16:45,900 --> 02:16:47,160
What am I like, missing?

2655
02:16:48,740 --> 02:16:50,380
Okay, I should raise my...

2656
02:16:50,380 --> 02:16:51,140
Okay, not her.

2657
02:16:51,140 --> 02:16:53,700
I should raise my relationship with the others, though.

2658
02:16:54,380 --> 02:16:54,780
Have fun.

2659
02:16:57,460 --> 02:16:57,620
Oh!

2660
02:17:05,050 --> 02:17:05,570
Nice!

2661
02:17:05,930 --> 02:17:06,450
Chestnut.

2662
02:17:07,650 --> 02:17:09,050
Okay, more old coins.

2663
02:17:09,610 --> 02:17:09,870
Alright.

2664
02:17:11,110 --> 02:17:11,690
Hello, don.

2665
02:17:12,690 --> 02:17:13,910
How very fascinating.

2666
02:17:14,710 --> 02:17:17,750
May the wind of Leon carry you forth to great renown.

2667
02:17:18,370 --> 02:17:20,790
I expect to see more of what you can do on the battlefield.

2668
02:17:21,350 --> 02:17:21,830
Oh nice!

2669
02:17:22,790 --> 02:17:24,210
He gave me a present.

2670
02:17:24,210 --> 02:17:24,430
What is it?

2671
02:17:25,630 --> 02:17:28,170
My bond with Donja has grown stronger.

2672
02:17:28,270 --> 02:17:29,090
That's great to hear.

2673
02:17:37,770 --> 02:17:39,790
Alright, let's see.

2674
02:17:39,950 --> 02:17:40,690
Old coins.

2675
02:17:41,910 --> 02:17:43,130
Can I have... Oh nice!

2676
02:17:43,230 --> 02:17:43,790
I have money!

2677
02:17:45,530 --> 02:17:46,050
Yippee!

2678
02:17:48,250 --> 02:17:49,330
Uh, is there any more?

2679
02:17:49,870 --> 02:17:51,130
Okay, there's no more bonds.

2680
02:17:55,390 --> 02:17:55,910
Uh...

2681
02:18:00,060 --> 02:18:01,280
Hello, child.

2682
02:18:01,860 --> 02:18:03,140
My child doctor.

2683
02:18:03,520 --> 02:18:05,920
And then hello, innkeeper.

2684
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:19,400
Okay...

2685
02:18:26,700 --> 02:18:27,980
You like...

2686
02:18:27,980 --> 02:18:29,420
You know...

2687
02:18:29,420 --> 02:18:32,480
Get rid of the... Oh my god, I look so fucking dead inside.

2688
02:18:34,260 --> 02:18:35,560
Oh my god!

2689
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:36,140
Oh my god!

2690
02:18:36,140 --> 02:18:39,440
I actually look so dead inside right now.

2691
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:41,440
Oh, I need sleep.

2692
02:18:43,060 --> 02:18:43,780
I...

2693
02:18:43,780 --> 02:18:58,820
What is a Consort Clan?

2694
02:18:59,060 --> 02:18:59,200
Yeah.

2695
02:19:10,480 --> 02:19:11,160
Okay.

2696
02:19:21,900 --> 02:19:22,580
Commoners?!

2697
02:19:22,580 --> 02:19:24,460
I can't believe it.

2698
02:19:24,660 --> 02:19:25,920
She should have been a concubine!

2699
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:34,720
Guys, I'm here to gossip with my innkeeper.

2700
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:37,200
And my child doctor.

2701
02:19:37,540 --> 02:19:38,700
While I'm getting...

2702
02:19:38,700 --> 02:19:40,940
Very, very drugged up right now.

2703
02:19:42,160 --> 02:19:42,820
Yeah,

2704
02:19:55,430 --> 02:19:58,110
I'm just spilling tea with my...

2705
02:19:58,830 --> 02:20:00,810
With my innkeeper and doctor.

2706
02:20:02,570 --> 02:20:03,110
Alright.

2707
02:20:03,510 --> 02:20:05,750
I am gonna use the bathroom real quick.

2708
02:20:05,850 --> 02:20:06,710
I'll be right back, guys.

2709
02:21:49,980 --> 02:21:50,880
I'm back!

2710
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:52,440
Alright, letter time!

2711
02:21:52,580 --> 02:21:54,580
Thank you!

2712
02:21:56,120 --> 02:21:58,040
Alright, time to read this letter.

2713
02:22:12,020 --> 02:22:13,840
I'm sure he'll be a great service to you.

2714
02:22:14,220 --> 02:22:16,200
He was always cheerful when speaking about you.

2715
02:22:16,460 --> 02:22:18,580
Talking about how your desk is always so messy.

2716
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:20,880
And how you put others before yourself to a fault.

2717
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:23,980
I'm all but certain that the doctor and you will get along so well.

2718
02:22:24,220 --> 02:22:26,540
I pray that the two of you will remain safe on your journey.

2719
02:22:26,700 --> 02:22:27,980
Thank you for the super chat, patient!

2720
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:29,020
Thank you, thank you!

2721
02:22:29,180 --> 02:22:31,260
I hope you don't die now that I took away your doctor.

2722
02:22:35,420 --> 02:22:35,780
Alright.

2723
02:22:35,780 --> 02:22:36,020
Alright.

2724
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:45,200
Recently, remnants of the Yellow Turbans calling themselves the White Way Bandits have been using their vast numbers to wreak havoc throughout the land.

2725
02:22:45,500 --> 02:22:50,120
All who will fight to bring peace to our world must gather in Silijo.

2726
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:51,440
Silijo, sorry.

2727
02:22:52,280 --> 02:22:52,900
Silijo.

2728
02:22:53,580 --> 02:22:59,260
Join the government forces led by General Heejin to crush those savage ruffians once and for all.

2729
02:22:59,260 --> 02:23:04,280
Let it be known that the might of the Emperor is the light of the people.

2730
02:23:04,940 --> 02:23:05,220
Alright.

2731
02:23:07,060 --> 02:23:09,680
Suggest subjugation of the White Way Bandits.

2732
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:10,820
Okay.

2733
02:23:14,140 --> 02:23:14,620
Alright.

2734
02:23:15,140 --> 02:23:17,380
It's time to destroy the White Way Bandits.

2735
02:23:17,440 --> 02:23:19,400
Oh my god, that's a lot of gems.

2736
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:22,040
Let me get rid of them.

2737
02:23:22,060 --> 02:23:23,740
Let me boost that.

2738
02:23:23,740 --> 02:23:31,200
When making gems, you may achieve satisfying results which grant you a greater than usual yield of gems from a single pyroxen.

2739
02:23:32,040 --> 02:23:33,020
Oh shit, nice.

2740
02:23:34,960 --> 02:23:39,620
God, I have like such a strong vortex gem, but like it's no use to me.

2741
02:23:40,120 --> 02:23:42,080
I rarely ever send them in the air.

2742
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:46,740
Alright guys, my voice is actually slowly dying.

2743
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:52,200
Which is crazy because I feel like I haven't been using my voice so much.

2744
02:23:53,740 --> 02:23:57,100
So I might have to start at the three hour mark.

2745
02:23:58,840 --> 02:24:02,940
I don't want to, but like my voice is not it right now.

2746
02:24:07,480 --> 02:24:09,900
I don't know why it's slowly dying.

2747
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:12,380
Oh wait, there's an item here.

2748
02:24:13,900 --> 02:24:15,360
Maybe it's all the calling.

2749
02:24:16,460 --> 02:24:18,340
I think it could be the calling.

2750
02:24:18,840 --> 02:24:19,860
I've always been like...

2751
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:23,440
Alright.

2752
02:24:26,120 --> 02:24:26,600
Oh!

2753
02:24:32,850 --> 02:24:33,810
Who are you?

2754
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:41,860
We'll now begin the war council.

2755
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:42,320
Okay.

2756
02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:54,040
Will we defeat the leader?

2757
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:55,960
Oh, they're just right here.

2758
02:24:56,640 --> 02:24:58,040
What if I just run straight at them?

2759
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:01,620
Just personally.

2760
02:25:02,140 --> 02:25:03,840
Do not allow any of these bandits...

2761
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:04,460
Oh wait, no.

2762
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:05,500
I need more XP though.

2763
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:10,860
Now, we have received word that thieves are raiding nearby villages.

2764
02:25:11,320 --> 02:25:13,380
The peasants have come begging for our aid.

2765
02:25:13,860 --> 02:25:16,060
Our top priority is serving the government.

2766
02:25:16,860 --> 02:25:19,840
And serving the government is the elimination of the bandits themselves.

2767
02:25:20,220 --> 02:25:22,340
Do not let your emotions sway you from that mission.

2768
02:25:22,980 --> 02:25:25,900
It must also be said that high-ranking members of the prestige...

2769
02:25:25,900 --> 02:25:27,800
The Yuan family are joining!

2770
02:25:29,900 --> 02:25:35,300
Oh my god, Yuan Shao has shown especially impressive spirit.

2771
02:25:35,780 --> 02:25:37,880
Oh my god, I heard he's really rich, guys.

2772
02:25:38,060 --> 02:25:39,480
I heard he owns a Ferrari.

2773
02:25:40,180 --> 02:25:43,740
He must just make short work of these bandits all by himself.

2774
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:50,320
I've also heard Yuan Shao of the same house is already approaching with an army to attack the enemy from behind.

2775
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:54,500
Zili is not far from the Emperor's home in Luoyang.

2776
02:25:54,820 --> 02:25:59,660
These filthy thieves cannot be allowed to run rampant here any longer.

2777
02:26:01,100 --> 02:26:01,720
Just one?

2778
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:02,260
Yes.

2779
02:26:02,660 --> 02:26:06,220
I remember in the older Dynasty Warrior games, they just gave him gold armor.

2780
02:26:07,160 --> 02:26:07,800
Like...

2781
02:26:08,780 --> 02:26:12,680
They literally was like, yeah, he's that rich.

2782
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:14,880
He literally is just wearing gold.

2783
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:16,320
Even though it's like not...

2784
02:26:16,320 --> 02:26:21,040
Even though like, you know, gold is not like the most ideal armor type.

2785
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:24,080
They literally just like, that's how rich he is.

2786
02:26:24,480 --> 02:26:26,160
Look at him, wearing gold.

2787
02:26:29,900 --> 02:26:32,880
Ah yes, the gold that was used for armor.

2788
02:26:34,300 --> 02:26:36,200
Yes, very ideal.

2789
02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:44,240
Oh my god.

2790
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:46,280
Okay.

2791
02:26:46,420 --> 02:26:47,980
Let's get rid of him and then we'll help.

2792
02:26:50,220 --> 02:26:51,580
We'll help the others later.

2793
02:26:55,780 --> 02:26:57,460
He was asking to be straight.

2794
02:26:57,540 --> 02:27:02,860
Look, he needs to let the army know just how rich he is.

2795
02:27:04,420 --> 02:27:06,300
It's all about sending a message.

2796
02:27:06,560 --> 02:27:07,640
It's not about protection.

2797
02:27:08,980 --> 02:27:11,220
Oh my god, that should have been a parry right there.

2798
02:27:12,260 --> 02:27:14,000
Okay, let's get rid of him too.

2799
02:27:16,440 --> 02:27:17,080
Nice.

2800
02:27:23,460 --> 02:27:25,340
For like two days.

2801
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:27,200
No, honestly for one day.

2802
02:27:30,140 --> 02:27:34,620
I'd be surprised if this village lasts one more day.

2803
02:27:37,060 --> 02:27:38,580
Get over here.

2804
02:27:38,580 --> 02:27:39,480
Nice.

2805
02:27:42,420 --> 02:27:43,040
Alright.

2806
02:27:48,820 --> 02:27:50,280
Come on, get over here.

2807
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:53,160
Are blocking the...

2808
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:55,000
We don't need reinforcements!

2809
02:27:55,140 --> 02:27:56,580
I am the reinforcements!

2810
02:28:01,100 --> 02:28:02,660
Oh my god, he's almost dead.

2811
02:28:05,540 --> 02:28:07,140
Wait, who's dying?

2812
02:28:10,060 --> 02:28:10,600
Oh shit!

2813
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:12,380
Oh shit!

2814
02:28:12,740 --> 02:28:14,420
Oh shit, okay, I'm coming back!

2815
02:28:14,780 --> 02:28:15,420
I'm coming over!

2816
02:28:16,780 --> 02:28:17,320
Oh no!

2817
02:28:18,220 --> 02:28:20,060
The noble man might die!

2818
02:28:20,480 --> 02:28:21,420
Who would have thought?

2819
02:28:22,020 --> 02:28:23,520
The guy that was not meant to...

2820
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:25,700
Oh my god!

2821
02:28:27,180 --> 02:28:27,820
Eat your branch!

2822
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:28,440
Eat your branch!

2823
02:28:28,440 --> 02:28:29,180
Eat your branch!

2824
02:28:29,400 --> 02:28:30,800
Oh thank god he ate his branch!

2825
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,540
It's fine, he ate his branch guys.

2826
02:28:34,680 --> 02:28:35,660
We saved him.

2827
02:28:36,300 --> 02:28:38,080
We reminded him how to eat food.

2828
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:47,220
It's okay guys!

2829
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:49,220
We reminded him how to eat!

2830
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:51,660
That's good!

2831
02:28:52,820 --> 02:28:53,940
I got no worries!

2832
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:56,260
Oh my god.

2833
02:28:56,260 --> 02:28:58,220
I'm at 100.

2834
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:00,160
107 now.

2835
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:01,780
Oh, I have a minute.

2836
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:03,340
Don't worry, I got this.

2837
02:29:04,340 --> 02:29:05,620
Holy shit!

2838
02:29:06,780 --> 02:29:07,420
Jesus!

2839
02:29:08,120 --> 02:29:09,620
There's so many people!

2840
02:29:10,220 --> 02:29:12,420
All these families I've killed!

2841
02:29:13,080 --> 02:29:14,320
All the widows!

2842
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:16,100
Oh my god, I almost died.

2843
02:29:16,260 --> 02:29:17,040
I actually almost died.

2844
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:19,440
I can't keep track.

2845
02:29:19,500 --> 02:29:20,700
There's way too many people.

2846
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:24,040
There's actually way too many people.

2847
02:29:24,900 --> 02:29:26,540
Oh my god!

2848
02:29:26,780 --> 02:29:28,100
I'm just getting...

2849
02:29:28,100 --> 02:29:31,120
I'm just getting fucking flipped everywhere!

2850
02:29:32,640 --> 02:29:34,200
Oh, this is my last bread.

2851
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:38,580
It was just everywhere.

2852
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:41,140
Oh no.

2853
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:44,520
Please, please eat your bread.

2854
02:29:44,860 --> 02:29:46,140
Please eat your bread.

2855
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:46,940
Please.

2856
02:29:49,960 --> 02:29:51,160
Please eat your bread.

2857
02:29:51,900 --> 02:29:52,840
Please eat your bread.

2858
02:29:53,260 --> 02:29:54,400
You're literally 1 HP.

2859
02:29:57,440 --> 02:29:59,640
Oh, I'm so scared for you.

2860
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:00,260
No!

2861
02:30:00,420 --> 02:30:01,140
You'd shoot!

2862
02:30:02,920 --> 02:30:05,480
Why didn't you eat your bread?!

2863
02:30:05,480 --> 02:30:07,340
I just met you!

2864
02:30:08,260 --> 02:30:10,160
How did he die?!

2865
02:30:11,780 --> 02:30:14,300
He is in gold armor.

2866
02:30:14,660 --> 02:30:17,160
I literally just met him!

2867
02:30:18,480 --> 02:30:20,160
How did he die already?!

2868
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:24,480
They only have one.

2869
02:30:24,740 --> 02:30:27,160
Why didn't you eat your bread?!

2870
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:31,680
Oh my god.

2871
02:30:34,500 --> 02:30:36,000
I can't believe it.

2872
02:30:36,500 --> 02:30:38,400
He refused to eat his bread.

2873
02:30:40,560 --> 02:30:42,200
Oh, this is so bad.

2874
02:30:45,960 --> 02:30:47,100
It's fine.

2875
02:30:49,160 --> 02:30:50,340
Oh no.

2876
02:30:54,400 --> 02:30:55,380
What happened?

2877
02:30:55,860 --> 02:30:56,560
Oh, what?

2878
02:30:58,460 --> 02:30:59,000
Pull it?

2879
02:30:59,020 --> 02:30:59,320
Why?

2880
02:30:59,860 --> 02:31:01,920
The pull down?

2881
02:31:02,300 --> 02:31:03,400
Oh, it's a new weapon!

2882
02:31:05,780 --> 02:31:06,800
Okay, but like...

2883
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:08,440
It's worse than my other weapon though.

2884
02:31:13,530 --> 02:31:14,770
But like...

2885
02:31:14,770 --> 02:31:15,970
But it's worse.

2886
02:31:21,270 --> 02:31:22,310
But like...

2887
02:31:22,310 --> 02:31:24,430
My thing is rank 80.

2888
02:31:24,690 --> 02:31:25,590
Guys, I'm not used.

2889
02:31:25,690 --> 02:31:26,370
Sorry guys.

2890
02:31:26,450 --> 02:31:27,110
I already lost.

2891
02:31:27,430 --> 02:31:29,430
Guys, I already lost Runeshell.

2892
02:31:30,510 --> 02:31:31,810
Guys, I already...

2893
02:31:31,810 --> 02:31:32,830
We can't, guys.

2894
02:31:33,010 --> 02:31:33,610
We can't.

2895
02:31:33,930 --> 02:31:35,850
I know you want me to use the big sword.

2896
02:31:36,350 --> 02:31:39,470
But I literally just lost Runeshell.

2897
02:31:40,230 --> 02:31:41,750
And like...

2898
02:31:41,750 --> 02:31:43,210
Oh my god, another ambush?

2899
02:31:44,090 --> 02:31:44,870
Wait, what?

2900
02:31:46,670 --> 02:31:47,950
What do you mean ambush?

2901
02:31:48,690 --> 02:31:50,590
What the fuck do you mean?

2902
02:31:51,830 --> 02:31:53,250
Guys, I cannot risk it.

2903
02:31:53,750 --> 02:31:54,590
I cannot.

2904
02:31:54,810 --> 02:31:55,790
Okay, maybe I can.

2905
02:31:55,890 --> 02:31:56,750
Okay, let me check.

2906
02:31:58,470 --> 02:31:59,070
How?

2907
02:31:59,270 --> 02:32:00,210
Okay, it's 46.

2908
02:32:00,310 --> 02:32:01,950
I'll use it for like...

2909
02:32:02,750 --> 02:32:03,650
One fight.

2910
02:32:04,790 --> 02:32:05,730
Oh shit.

2911
02:32:06,290 --> 02:32:07,370
Oh shit.

2912
02:32:07,890 --> 02:32:10,250
This is pretty bad.

2913
02:32:11,410 --> 02:32:14,310
Guys, I don't feel confident right now.

2914
02:32:16,370 --> 02:32:16,990
Guys...

2915
02:32:18,530 --> 02:32:19,630
Oh wait, he's dead.

2916
02:32:19,750 --> 02:32:19,970
Okay.

2917
02:32:20,090 --> 02:32:21,770
I feel so confident, guys.

2918
02:32:22,450 --> 02:32:23,510
I did it.

2919
02:32:25,570 --> 02:32:26,190
Okay.

2920
02:32:26,830 --> 02:32:29,870
We need to get a base for...

2921
02:32:29,870 --> 02:32:31,490
Wait, is there food here?

2922
02:32:32,230 --> 02:32:33,730
God fuck, I need food.

2923
02:32:35,090 --> 02:32:36,890
Oh, this is so bad.

2924
02:32:38,410 --> 02:32:40,190
This is actually so bad.

2925
02:32:40,650 --> 02:32:42,500
I think I can live.

2926
02:32:42,500 --> 02:32:44,020
I think I can live here.

2927
02:32:45,540 --> 02:32:46,120
Maybe.

2928
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:49,160
I think it's possible.

2929
02:32:49,460 --> 02:32:50,500
I think I can live.

2930
02:32:51,380 --> 02:32:52,780
Can't be that bad, right?

2931
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:54,180
Oh, I don't have allies.

2932
02:32:54,420 --> 02:32:54,860
Oh shit.

2933
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:57,440
Okay, that's not good.

2934
02:32:58,280 --> 02:32:59,360
I went the wrong way.

2935
02:33:02,480 --> 02:33:03,540
Oh no.

2936
02:33:04,420 --> 02:33:06,380
Oh no, this is pretty bad.

2937
02:33:07,700 --> 02:33:08,280
Okay.

2938
02:33:08,280 --> 02:33:08,440
Okay.

2939
02:33:09,320 --> 02:33:13,060
We'll go here so we can help them get reinforcements.

2940
02:33:14,060 --> 02:33:15,580
Oh my god, where are the jars?

2941
02:33:17,220 --> 02:33:19,560
Oh my god, where are the breakable jars?

2942
02:33:20,380 --> 02:33:24,280
Where the fuck are the breakable- Where are the buns?!

2943
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:28,300
Are we in another famine?!

2944
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:33,840
Oh, this is pretty bad.

2945
02:33:33,960 --> 02:33:36,140
I think we're in another famine, guys.

2946
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:40,660
Oh my god.

2947
02:33:40,760 --> 02:33:42,920
I'm killing you as fast as I can!

2948
02:33:44,440 --> 02:33:46,360
Please don't die to the nerd!

2949
02:33:47,220 --> 02:33:47,720
Oh, okay.

2950
02:33:49,420 --> 02:33:50,960
Okay, it was just that easy.

2951
02:33:51,080 --> 02:33:51,900
Okay, nevermind.

2952
02:33:51,960 --> 02:33:54,460
We let one guy die.

2953
02:33:54,860 --> 02:33:56,700
Okay, this is your fault.

2954
02:33:57,200 --> 02:33:59,300
We didn't- Oh my god, this is your fault.

2955
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:02,380
I came back to help you, but you didn't even need help.

2956
02:34:04,560 --> 02:34:06,520
You literally didn't even need help.

2957
02:34:06,520 --> 02:34:07,660
Okay, alright.

2958
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:11,140
Alright, we lost our two generals because of you.

2959
02:34:16,190 --> 02:34:17,090
Oh my god.

2960
02:34:17,490 --> 02:34:20,590
I'm trying to be, like, super careful right now.

2961
02:34:21,610 --> 02:34:24,210
I'm, like, really scared.

2962
02:34:29,050 --> 02:34:31,390
I'm really scared right now.

2963
02:34:31,590 --> 02:34:32,990
Please tell me you dropped buns.

2964
02:34:33,170 --> 02:34:35,730
Oh, fucking course the nerd doesn't drop any buns.

2965
02:34:36,490 --> 02:34:38,310
Oh, fucking course he doesn't.

2966
02:34:39,710 --> 02:34:40,910
Oh, no.

2967
02:34:41,230 --> 02:34:43,610
Okay, this is gonna be a little scary, guys.

2968
02:34:44,010 --> 02:34:47,530
This might be a little scary, guys.

2969
02:34:52,270 --> 02:34:55,770
This might be a little scary, guys.

2970
02:34:57,510 --> 02:34:59,690
Alright, I have to activate Rage Mode.

2971
02:35:03,070 --> 02:35:07,230
I have to activate Rage Mode for my survival.

2972
02:35:07,230 --> 02:35:10,530
I gotta be very angry.

2973
02:35:13,470 --> 02:35:16,310
I gotta be very angry.

2974
02:35:19,530 --> 02:35:20,750
Oh my god.

2975
02:35:24,140 --> 02:35:25,960
Okay, that did nothing.

2976
02:35:30,610 --> 02:35:31,030
Okay.

2977
02:35:32,250 --> 02:35:35,450
Let me get back my other weapon.

2978
02:35:35,870 --> 02:35:38,350
That did absolutely nothing.

2979
02:35:38,350 --> 02:35:38,990
Okay.

2980
02:35:42,110 --> 02:35:44,430
Oh shit, I did not mean it.

2981
02:35:45,250 --> 02:35:45,890
Wait.

2982
02:35:46,350 --> 02:35:47,610
Oh my god, I got a bun!

2983
02:35:48,430 --> 02:35:50,650
Oh my god, he led me to the bun!

2984
02:35:51,550 --> 02:35:52,150
It's winnable!

2985
02:35:54,630 --> 02:35:57,750
But sword thing, dog doggy.

2986
02:35:58,150 --> 02:35:58,450
Sword.

2987
02:35:59,490 --> 02:36:01,190
Sword's so big!

2988
02:36:04,410 --> 02:36:06,910
I'm trying my best to assist him!

2989
02:36:06,910 --> 02:36:07,410
I'm fighting!

2990
02:36:07,510 --> 02:36:10,110
I'm literally fighting the biggest boss out there!

2991
02:36:15,210 --> 02:36:15,990
Oh my god, please.

2992
02:36:16,570 --> 02:36:17,270
Please just live.

2993
02:36:17,630 --> 02:36:18,830
Please just live.

2994
02:36:18,950 --> 02:36:23,270
I'm literally fighting the heart- the biggest boss in this game.

2995
02:36:27,450 --> 02:36:28,810
Oh my god!

2996
02:36:28,930 --> 02:36:29,590
Please eat a bun!

2997
02:36:29,830 --> 02:36:30,610
Please eat a bun!

2998
02:36:30,830 --> 02:36:31,650
Please eat a bun!

2999
02:36:31,970 --> 02:36:32,270
Please!

3000
02:36:32,370 --> 02:36:33,130
Oh, thank god!

3001
02:36:33,350 --> 02:36:33,730
Thank god!

3002
02:36:33,730 --> 02:36:36,770
I literally just needed to eat one thing and that was to be a bun.

3003
02:36:39,710 --> 02:36:40,590
Jesus Christ.

3004
02:36:44,270 --> 02:36:45,310
Oh my god, please.

3005
02:36:46,050 --> 02:36:46,450
Please.

3006
02:36:47,990 --> 02:36:51,230
Just keep- Just keep getting staggered.

3007
02:36:54,830 --> 02:36:57,990
Okay, I- I don't think I'm gonna win this.

3008
02:36:58,110 --> 02:36:59,870
I think this would be my first loss.

3009
02:37:04,930 --> 02:37:08,410
I'm not confident in my team right now.

3010
02:37:11,610 --> 02:37:15,050
It's literally me and the- and our main guy.

3011
02:37:16,990 --> 02:37:19,630
Like, I've- all my generals are dead.

3012
02:37:19,770 --> 02:37:22,530
It's literally me and my- Oh no!

3013
02:37:23,110 --> 02:37:24,150
Oh no!

3014
02:37:24,690 --> 02:37:26,470
All my generals are dead!

3015
02:37:26,550 --> 02:37:27,770
It's literally me and him!

3016
02:37:29,770 --> 02:37:30,910
Okay, nice.

3017
02:37:34,930 --> 02:37:36,050
Oh no.

3018
02:37:38,490 --> 02:37:39,810
Get me out of here.

3019
02:37:40,470 --> 02:37:41,450
Get me out of here.

3020
02:37:42,870 --> 02:37:43,870
If I- what?

3021
02:37:45,090 --> 02:37:46,090
Who is he?

3022
02:37:49,070 --> 02:37:50,170
Wait, what?

3023
02:37:52,730 --> 02:37:53,410
Oh!

3024
02:37:53,550 --> 02:37:54,450
Oh, he's bugged.

3025
02:37:54,910 --> 02:37:57,730
It's like, didn't I kill you?

3026
02:37:58,310 --> 02:38:04,310
I- I was just like, didn't I- Didn't I kill this man?

3027
02:38:05,550 --> 02:38:06,090
Oh.

3028
02:38:07,430 --> 02:38:08,390
It's fine.

3029
02:38:10,330 --> 02:38:11,330
It's fine.

3030
02:38:11,830 --> 02:38:14,630
You know, I could've tried- You know, okay, that's good.

3031
02:38:14,710 --> 02:38:15,710
We can have him there.

3032
02:38:17,170 --> 02:38:17,730
Okay.

3033
02:38:18,270 --> 02:38:19,070
That's good.

3034
02:38:19,370 --> 02:38:23,450
As long as he never gets activated, I can live through this.

3035
02:38:24,670 --> 02:38:25,750
He can live.

3036
02:38:26,610 --> 02:38:28,750
It's time to solo an army right now.

3037
02:38:29,210 --> 02:38:31,530
I can- I cannot activate it, guys.

3038
02:38:31,990 --> 02:38:34,950
I- literally it's me and the main general.

3039
02:38:35,330 --> 02:38:36,750
I can't let him die.

3040
02:38:38,230 --> 02:38:39,630
I can solo this.

3041
02:38:40,730 --> 02:38:42,330
I'll solo the entire army.

3042
02:38:43,910 --> 02:38:45,390
Don't worry, I got this.

3043
02:38:47,190 --> 02:38:48,450
It's me and him.

3044
02:38:48,830 --> 02:38:50,630
Okay, and like 200 arrows.

3045
02:38:51,090 --> 02:38:52,350
But it's me and him.

3046
02:38:54,390 --> 02:38:55,310
That's right.

3047
02:38:56,930 --> 02:38:59,490
This army has- oh my god!

3048
02:38:59,490 --> 02:39:01,490
A thousand?!

3049
02:39:02,130 --> 02:39:05,250
Oh, I- I'm a true warrior now.

3050
02:39:06,990 --> 02:39:07,070
Hello?

3051
02:39:09,830 --> 02:39:10,950
Hello?

3052
02:39:11,130 --> 02:39:11,370
Hello?

3053
02:39:12,770 --> 02:39:13,450
Hello?

3054
02:39:13,990 --> 02:39:15,490
Oh my god.

3055
02:39:16,450 --> 02:39:19,330
I can't believe it crashed!

3056
02:39:20,890 --> 02:39:22,310
I have to fuck!

3057
02:39:27,440 --> 02:39:30,060
It's so far!

3058
02:39:30,060 --> 02:39:32,740
Oh my god!

3059
02:39:32,800 --> 02:39:35,000
My controller isn't working!

3060
02:39:36,640 --> 02:39:39,000
I need to reboot my game.

3061
02:39:40,600 --> 02:39:49,660
Legitimately, what happened was you are a true warrior and then my entire PC just killed itself.

3062
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:52,400
I don't know what happened.

3063
02:39:53,080 --> 02:39:58,880
I- I- It's like, you are a true warrior now.

3064
02:39:59,040 --> 02:40:01,400
And then the game was like, what?

3065
02:40:02,080 --> 02:40:04,660
Are you a true warrior?

3066
02:40:04,820 --> 02:40:07,240
You have nothing else to accomplish anymore.

3067
02:40:07,800 --> 02:40:08,580
You've made it.

3068
02:40:09,100 --> 02:40:13,560
The game was like, you have nothing else to accomplish.

3069
02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:15,100
You've made it now.

3070
02:40:17,080 --> 02:40:18,900
I'm so sad!

3071
02:40:19,780 --> 02:40:20,100
No!

3072
02:40:24,040 --> 02:40:25,740
Oh my god!

3073
02:40:26,680 --> 02:40:29,440
I have to do this all over again!

3074
02:40:30,020 --> 02:40:32,220
Oh my god!

3075
02:40:32,320 --> 02:40:34,160
I'm so sad!

3076
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:37,080
I'm so sad!

3077
02:40:39,460 --> 02:40:41,740
Oh my god!

3078
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:43,640
Alright, we're speedriding this.

3079
02:40:45,140 --> 02:40:47,680
We're fucking- Oh my god!

3080
02:40:49,440 --> 02:40:50,620
Oh my god!

3081
02:40:50,820 --> 02:40:52,280
I worked so hard!

3082
02:40:52,540 --> 02:40:55,200
I worked so hard too!

3083
02:40:56,640 --> 02:40:59,040
Alright, this time we can save Genshou.

3084
02:40:59,460 --> 02:41:02,160
We can- It wasn't a canon event, guys.

3085
02:41:03,420 --> 02:41:06,800
Guys, it wasn't a canon event.

3086
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:07,940
We can save him.

3087
02:41:09,020 --> 02:41:10,920
We can save him.

3088
02:41:11,320 --> 02:41:12,900
It wasn't canon.

3089
02:41:13,520 --> 02:41:15,380
Okay, thank- Okay, you know what?

3090
02:41:15,460 --> 02:41:19,200
I think this is a good time to announce that like, um...

3091
02:41:19,900 --> 02:41:24,240
Haya is sending me another PC so I can do dual streaming.

3092
02:41:26,240 --> 02:41:32,180
At this point, I definitely needed at this point.

3093
02:41:35,300 --> 02:41:38,620
So I'm gonna actually have a dual PC setup.

3094
02:41:40,840 --> 02:41:43,660
Oh my god, I'm so sad!

3095
02:41:45,680 --> 02:41:46,900
Okay, nice.

3096
02:41:47,200 --> 02:41:49,660
Okay, this time we're gonna save Genshou.

3097
02:41:50,740 --> 02:41:52,160
We're gonna save him.

3098
02:41:52,600 --> 02:41:55,480
It's not gonna be canon, I swear.

3099
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:58,920
I wonder if it's for tenacity.

3100
02:41:59,560 --> 02:42:03,620
I wonder if it's because I hit a thousand and that's why.

3101
02:42:04,060 --> 02:42:06,240
I wonder if that's why that happened.

3102
02:42:06,580 --> 02:42:07,240
I don't know.

3103
02:42:08,240 --> 02:42:11,400
Like, the timing for that is crazy though.

3104
02:42:11,600 --> 02:42:13,140
If that was the reason why.

3105
02:42:14,040 --> 02:42:16,840
Oh my god, I'm getting- Oh my god, no, not again.

3106
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:18,240
Not again.

3107
02:42:18,940 --> 02:42:19,820
Not again.

3108
02:42:19,960 --> 02:42:20,880
Oh no.

3109
02:42:21,480 --> 02:42:23,760
Oh no, I'm getting bodied everywhere.

3110
02:42:24,320 --> 02:42:26,920
Gotta save the rich kid this time.

3111
02:42:29,420 --> 02:42:29,860
Okay.

3112
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:31,400
It's not as bad.

3113
02:42:31,440 --> 02:42:32,580
It's not as bad this time.

3114
02:42:32,840 --> 02:42:33,420
Nice, we did it.

3115
02:42:35,800 --> 02:42:37,140
Oh my god, I swear.

3116
02:42:37,900 --> 02:42:38,360
I wanna know.

3117
02:42:38,500 --> 02:42:43,780
Okay, let's try and get a thousand again and see if it actually- I'm actually curious.

3118
02:42:44,360 --> 02:42:49,480
Let's try to get a thousand again and see if my PC dies because of it.

3119
02:42:50,620 --> 02:42:52,760
I'm actually curious.

3120
02:42:59,860 --> 02:43:01,520
Oh, we're at 400.

3121
02:43:01,700 --> 02:43:03,020
We're getting there, guys.

3122
02:43:03,480 --> 02:43:04,860
We're getting there.

3123
02:43:08,540 --> 02:43:10,340
We are getting there.

3124
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:13,940
Oh my god, there's so many arrows.

3125
02:43:15,600 --> 02:43:16,560
Oh, 500!

3126
02:43:16,860 --> 02:43:17,340
Halfway!

3127
02:43:19,160 --> 02:43:20,120
For science!

3128
02:43:23,420 --> 02:43:24,760
We're halfway there, guys.

3129
02:43:26,840 --> 02:43:27,600
Okay, Yongfei.

3130
02:43:27,700 --> 02:43:29,280
Isn't that the- That's the main boss.

3131
02:43:29,460 --> 02:43:30,060
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

3132
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:33,320
Okay, I canceled it.

3133
02:43:34,140 --> 02:43:35,420
I'm so locked in.

3134
02:43:37,780 --> 02:43:42,120
Jesus Christ, there's so many fucking arrows!

3135
02:43:45,100 --> 02:43:46,380
Get the assault in.

3136
02:43:48,900 --> 02:43:49,660
Okay, nice.

3137
02:43:50,880 --> 02:43:53,040
That's fucking- Get out of there, Yongfei!

3138
02:43:55,920 --> 02:43:58,660
I got the big sword that we're not gonna use, guys.

3139
02:43:58,740 --> 02:43:59,800
We are not using the big sword.

3140
02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:02,200
We are not using the big sword, guys.

3141
02:44:03,240 --> 02:44:05,420
The big sword, it was not that good.

3142
02:44:07,600 --> 02:44:13,720
Alright, for science, we're gonna figure out if it was because I became a true warrior.

3143
02:44:18,800 --> 02:44:20,080
We're coming over.

3144
02:44:23,140 --> 02:44:24,820
Don't worry, I'm coming over.

3145
02:44:27,300 --> 02:44:28,820
Oh, I went the wrong way.

3146
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:29,200
Sorry.

3147
02:44:29,680 --> 02:44:30,840
I'm coming over for real.

3148
02:44:31,820 --> 02:44:32,720
Don't worry!

3149
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:33,300
Don't worry!

3150
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:38,040
I'm coming over to actually protect the village for real this time.

3151
02:44:42,280 --> 02:44:45,580
Okay, you're not stealing this kill from me.

3152
02:44:46,840 --> 02:44:47,180
Nice.

3153
02:44:48,160 --> 02:44:48,240
Alright,

3154
02:44:53,080 --> 02:44:53,280
nice.

3155
02:44:53,560 --> 02:44:53,700
Alright.

3156
02:44:56,260 --> 02:44:57,220
Here's the other one.

3157
02:44:58,440 --> 02:44:59,140
We did it.

3158
02:44:59,160 --> 02:45:00,340
We saved a village.

3159
02:45:01,940 --> 02:45:03,620
Repay me by paying for me.

3160
02:45:03,660 --> 02:45:05,260
This is not free service, guys.

3161
02:45:05,360 --> 02:45:06,400
I am a mercenary.

3162
02:45:08,580 --> 02:45:08,980
Oh, shit.

3163
02:45:09,960 --> 02:45:12,120
You guys gotta know, this isn't for free.

3164
02:45:16,420 --> 02:45:16,920
What?

3165
02:45:18,920 --> 02:45:22,660
Bro, I think you gotta worry about something else other than starving.

3166
02:45:23,440 --> 02:45:29,320
They're literally trying to fucking kill you.

3167
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:33,620
I think you gotta worry about something else other than starving.

3168
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:39,720
300 more to go, guys!

3169
02:45:42,340 --> 02:45:43,460
300 more!

3170
02:45:43,540 --> 02:45:44,520
We're almost there!

3171
02:45:51,520 --> 02:45:52,500
There's the head.

3172
02:45:58,120 --> 02:45:58,480
Me!

3173
02:45:58,480 --> 02:45:59,620
It's gonna be me!

3174
02:46:02,900 --> 02:46:03,260
Shit.

3175
02:46:04,100 --> 02:46:04,580
Oh, shit.

3176
02:46:06,120 --> 02:46:07,440
I'm trying my best.

3177
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:11,220
Oh my god, they don't have names!

3178
02:46:11,320 --> 02:46:12,580
How are you tied to the no-namers?

3179
02:46:16,420 --> 02:46:16,780
Nice.

3180
02:46:17,840 --> 02:46:18,200
Okay.

3181
02:46:19,280 --> 02:46:19,560
That's it.

3182
02:46:21,420 --> 02:46:23,040
Oh my god, I think that guy has a name, actually.

3183
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:25,980
Wait, I think that guy actually has a name.

3184
02:46:26,500 --> 02:46:27,360
No, he has no name!

3185
02:46:27,420 --> 02:46:28,840
How are you tied to a no-namer?

3186
02:46:29,080 --> 02:46:30,300
You have a name!

3187
02:46:33,160 --> 02:46:36,220
Oh my god, please.

3188
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:40,620
That's right.

3189
02:46:41,020 --> 02:46:42,680
You know exactly what I'm doing here.

3190
02:46:42,800 --> 02:46:45,060
Oh, he walked into the wave.

3191
02:46:45,220 --> 02:46:45,760
That's funny.

3192
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:50,500
How is your courage decreasing?

3193
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:52,960
I'm literally winning every fucking fight out there.

3194
02:46:56,040 --> 02:46:58,320
Oh my god, please.

3195
02:46:59,180 --> 02:47:01,380
Please stop being bad!

3196
02:47:05,280 --> 02:47:06,440
Oh my god, please.

3197
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:10,240
Why are my generals so fucking bad?

3198
02:47:13,520 --> 02:47:13,820
Nice.

3199
02:47:14,060 --> 02:47:14,720
Get out.

3200
02:47:16,100 --> 02:47:16,340
Okay.

3201
02:47:17,180 --> 02:47:17,860
Can't die.

3202
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:21,780
I'm working so hard right now.

3203
02:47:21,860 --> 02:47:25,780
I'm actually I'm actually speedrunning this so hard.

3204
02:47:27,360 --> 02:47:28,020
Come on.

3205
02:47:28,360 --> 02:47:29,800
Can't let them die.

3206
02:47:32,680 --> 02:47:33,640
Alright, you didn't show.

3207
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:34,740
Do not die.

3208
02:47:34,980 --> 02:47:36,340
He has no name and you're rich.

3209
02:47:38,160 --> 02:47:39,740
That's all I asked for.

3210
02:47:42,140 --> 02:47:43,620
Okay, nice.

3211
02:47:44,600 --> 02:47:47,620
I wonder if I have to help him with the reinforcements, too.

3212
02:47:49,380 --> 02:47:51,120
Because I had to deal with this first.

3213
02:47:52,580 --> 02:47:54,220
Alright, open the gates.

3214
02:47:55,420 --> 02:47:56,060
Boom.

3215
02:47:57,960 --> 02:47:58,600
Boom.

3216
02:48:00,140 --> 02:48:00,780
Boom.

3217
02:48:01,360 --> 02:48:01,600
Alright.

3218
02:48:02,340 --> 02:48:02,900
It's time.

3219
02:48:06,080 --> 02:48:06,900
It's time.

3220
02:48:07,420 --> 02:48:09,080
It's time to be angry.

3221
02:48:11,540 --> 02:48:12,480
Oh, fuck.

3222
02:48:12,560 --> 02:48:14,700
Okay, it's time to actually be angry.

3223
02:48:15,300 --> 02:48:18,960
I can't see anything, but I think I'm being angry right now.

3224
02:48:21,380 --> 02:48:22,160
Okay, nice.

3225
02:48:23,880 --> 02:48:24,700
Okay, nice.

3226
02:48:24,760 --> 02:48:26,080
I got the break just in time.

3227
02:48:27,520 --> 02:48:28,040
Nice.

3228
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,580
Alright, this is going a lot faster than before.

3229
02:48:33,740 --> 02:48:34,840
Thank fucking God.

3230
02:48:36,540 --> 02:48:37,500
Nice parry.

3231
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:41,640
Alright, use my musou.

3232
02:48:46,130 --> 02:48:47,890
Yeah, the big story was definitely not it.

3233
02:48:47,890 --> 02:48:49,250
Oh, 100 left.

3234
02:48:51,930 --> 02:48:55,750
Guys, 100 left.

3235
02:48:57,670 --> 02:48:59,650
We're almost there.

3236
02:48:59,750 --> 02:49:00,850
Oh, he just got back up.

3237
02:49:05,730 --> 02:49:07,470
100 left.

3238
02:49:08,450 --> 02:49:11,150
We're almost there.

3239
02:49:12,710 --> 02:49:13,730
Oh, shit.

3240
02:49:13,890 --> 02:49:14,650
Okay, not easy.

3241
02:49:17,890 --> 02:49:19,190
I'm not parrying this.

3242
02:49:19,310 --> 02:49:20,410
Why am I not parrying it?

3243
02:49:23,680 --> 02:49:25,530
There's too many guards!

3244
02:49:28,670 --> 02:49:29,950
Jesus Christ.

3245
02:49:30,270 --> 02:49:31,410
He's like breaking everything.

3246
02:49:34,730 --> 02:49:36,170
We're getting there.

3247
02:49:37,610 --> 02:49:40,010
We gotta test our hypothesis soon.

3248
02:49:43,710 --> 02:49:44,490
Okay.

3249
02:49:45,230 --> 02:49:47,570
Get this guy out of here too.

3250
02:49:48,450 --> 02:49:49,710
Get him out of here.

3251
02:49:52,710 --> 02:49:54,050
That's fucking right.

3252
02:49:55,270 --> 02:49:57,470
How many openings are there?

3253
02:49:59,090 --> 02:50:00,170
Alright, nice.

3254
02:50:00,290 --> 02:50:00,670
We did it.

3255
02:50:04,910 --> 02:50:06,690
Alright, here we go.

3256
02:50:07,350 --> 02:50:08,770
Here we go.

3257
02:50:08,770 --> 02:50:09,650
Hahaha.

3258
02:50:12,450 --> 02:50:15,110
The moment of truth, guys.

3259
02:50:15,890 --> 02:50:19,230
The moment of truth, everybody.

3260
02:50:26,350 --> 02:50:27,010
Alright.

3261
02:50:28,670 --> 02:50:29,990
982!

3262
02:50:34,790 --> 02:50:36,110
997!

3263
02:50:39,970 --> 02:50:42,510
I am now a true warrior.

3264
02:50:42,990 --> 02:50:44,890
Army of one!

3265
02:50:46,310 --> 02:50:48,990
Here I cure my cause!

3266
02:50:50,530 --> 02:50:51,850
Wait, I'm still alive.

3267
02:50:52,690 --> 02:50:54,690
My PC is still holding strong!

3268
02:50:56,270 --> 02:50:57,490
This is it!

3269
02:50:58,070 --> 02:50:59,350
It has adapted!

3270
02:50:59,770 --> 02:51:01,230
I am a true warrior!

3271
02:51:02,470 --> 02:51:03,630
I have no more HP.

3272
02:51:03,630 --> 02:51:04,970
Holy crap!

3273
02:51:06,710 --> 02:51:07,790
Guys, this is bad.

3274
02:51:08,530 --> 02:51:10,810
Guys, I don't have any more buns now.

3275
02:51:12,110 --> 02:51:13,030
Oh no.

3276
02:51:16,250 --> 02:51:17,190
Oh no.

3277
02:51:18,410 --> 02:51:19,970
Not the call to assemble.

3278
02:51:21,370 --> 02:51:22,630
Oh no, where am I?

3279
02:51:23,070 --> 02:51:23,910
Where am I?

3280
02:51:24,170 --> 02:51:24,410
No!

3281
02:51:27,270 --> 02:51:29,270
Take the northwest base?

3282
02:51:29,750 --> 02:51:31,110
I have to take the base?!

3283
02:51:33,630 --> 02:51:35,110
Wait, how do I do this?

3284
02:51:35,710 --> 02:51:36,250
How do I?

3285
02:51:36,490 --> 02:51:38,150
Oh no, this is bad.

3286
02:51:38,410 --> 02:51:42,850
How the fuck do I take the base in two minutes?

3287
02:51:44,670 --> 02:51:46,050
Okay, this is bad.

3288
02:51:46,190 --> 02:51:46,790
This is bad.

3289
02:51:47,590 --> 02:51:49,630
I don't think I'm supposed to...

3290
02:51:50,510 --> 02:51:51,430
Oh no.

3291
02:51:52,890 --> 02:51:57,650
I don't think I can take that base in fucking two minutes.

3292
02:52:00,610 --> 02:52:02,510
Oh, there's too many people!

3293
02:52:03,910 --> 02:52:04,850
I have to kill him.

3294
02:52:05,290 --> 02:52:06,230
I have to kill him.

3295
02:52:09,230 --> 02:52:10,090
Oh no.

3296
02:52:11,850 --> 02:52:13,330
I actually need to kill him in time.

3297
02:52:13,710 --> 02:52:15,550
But I don't know if that's possible.

3298
02:52:17,550 --> 02:52:19,190
There's no way!

3299
02:52:21,910 --> 02:52:22,790
What base?

3300
02:52:26,050 --> 02:52:28,230
Wait, what base am I supposed to take?

3301
02:52:29,110 --> 02:52:31,970
Oh, this base?!

3302
02:52:31,970 --> 02:52:32,830
Oh shit.

3303
02:52:33,430 --> 02:52:34,110
Oh shit.

3304
02:52:34,370 --> 02:52:35,870
I just realized he meant this base.

3305
02:52:36,990 --> 02:52:38,210
Oh fuck, okay.

3306
02:52:39,030 --> 02:52:41,050
Okay, I just realized which base it is.

3307
02:52:42,290 --> 02:52:43,330
I just...

3308
02:52:43,870 --> 02:52:45,110
One minute, let's go!

3309
02:52:47,930 --> 02:52:49,090
One minute, let's go!

3310
02:52:50,790 --> 02:52:52,490
If I get angry, I can do it.

3311
02:52:52,490 --> 02:52:53,110
I can do it.

3312
02:52:55,510 --> 02:52:57,310
I just need to get very angry.

3313
02:53:01,310 --> 02:53:04,290
I just need to get very angry.

3314
02:53:07,430 --> 02:53:07,990
It's fine.

3315
02:53:11,190 --> 02:53:12,290
Oh thank god, I did it!

3316
02:53:14,470 --> 02:53:15,570
I got very angry!

3317
02:53:18,430 --> 02:53:19,490
We did it!

3318
02:53:22,490 --> 02:53:23,850
Oh my god, I'm breakdancing.

3319
02:53:26,890 --> 02:53:27,690
That's right!

3320
02:53:28,190 --> 02:53:31,510
Hear me breakdance before I use my Musou!

3321
02:53:35,610 --> 02:53:37,630
Alright, that's fucking right, you're not.

3322
02:53:38,590 --> 02:53:40,250
You're not going to win.

3323
02:53:41,370 --> 02:53:42,810
I forgot to grab some bread.

3324
02:53:43,450 --> 02:53:44,510
Oh, this is bad.

3325
02:53:44,930 --> 02:53:48,310
I legitimately forgot to grab some bread while I got here.

3326
02:53:50,290 --> 02:53:52,970
Alright, alright guys, I'll be right back.

3327
02:53:53,390 --> 02:53:54,350
Oh shit!

3328
02:53:56,810 --> 02:53:58,230
Guys, I'll be right back.

3329
02:53:58,590 --> 02:53:59,910
Guys, I'll be right back.

3330
02:54:00,010 --> 02:54:01,590
Let me grab some bread real quick.

3331
02:54:01,890 --> 02:54:02,310
Let me...

3332
02:54:04,450 --> 02:54:05,410
Let me...

3333
02:54:08,210 --> 02:54:09,450
Give me a sec.

3334
02:54:09,590 --> 02:54:11,850
Let me grab some bread real quick.

3335
02:54:12,890 --> 02:54:14,250
Where are the bread containers?

3336
02:54:14,470 --> 02:54:15,110
There it is.

3337
02:54:15,590 --> 02:54:16,670
I'm coming back soon.

3338
02:54:18,550 --> 02:54:19,210
Nice!

3339
02:54:19,430 --> 02:54:20,690
I did it!

3340
02:54:20,890 --> 02:54:21,730
I did it!

3341
02:54:23,630 --> 02:54:24,290
Nice!

3342
02:54:25,070 --> 02:54:25,730
Successful!

3343
02:54:26,710 --> 02:54:28,790
Oh my god, we did it guys!

3344
02:54:30,810 --> 02:54:32,570
We fucking did it!

3345
02:54:32,670 --> 02:54:35,250
I don't know what happened, but we fucking did it!

3346
02:54:37,450 --> 02:54:39,790
Oh my god, good job everybody!

3347
02:54:41,850 --> 02:54:45,470
I don't know what happened, but good job everyone!

3348
02:54:46,230 --> 02:54:46,990
Holy shit!

3349
02:54:52,490 --> 02:54:56,010
Oh my god, I've always known we could do it.

3350
02:54:57,990 --> 02:54:59,610
I was very hungry.

3351
02:54:59,810 --> 02:55:00,510
Sorry team.

3352
02:55:01,610 --> 02:55:05,170
I was incredibly hungry, but it's okay, I'm here now.

3353
02:55:06,510 --> 02:55:07,370
Oh shit.

3354
02:55:08,530 --> 02:55:09,550
It's okay, I'm here now.

3355
02:55:09,670 --> 02:55:10,150
Don't worry.

3356
02:55:11,870 --> 02:55:13,070
Oh my...

3357
02:55:13,070 --> 02:55:14,790
Holy shit!

3358
02:55:15,330 --> 02:55:18,030
Bro, it's like everybody's here.

3359
02:55:18,250 --> 02:55:21,870
Bro, you just got fucking mobbed by the entire army.

3360
02:55:24,250 --> 02:55:25,250
There we go, we did it.

3361
02:55:28,090 --> 02:55:30,690
That poor guy, he got actually mobbed.

3362
02:55:30,970 --> 02:55:33,070
Get him, Mike!

3363
02:55:36,510 --> 02:55:37,510
We did it!

3364
02:55:38,110 --> 02:55:39,270
We did it!

3365
02:55:43,750 --> 02:55:46,850
Oh my god, we fucking did it!

3366
02:55:47,290 --> 02:55:49,530
One crash doesn't stop me!

3367
02:55:50,610 --> 02:55:51,870
For Doki!

3368
02:56:00,250 --> 02:56:04,770
It was like an actual Zerg rush, that was fucking crazy.

3369
02:56:05,110 --> 02:56:05,750
Look at that!

3370
02:56:06,390 --> 02:56:07,790
Crashing was good, guys.

3371
02:56:07,950 --> 02:56:09,670
We saved Renshao.

3372
02:56:09,990 --> 02:56:12,390
We changed the cat in the event.

3373
02:56:12,790 --> 02:56:13,930
We saved him.

3374
02:56:15,390 --> 02:56:16,730
Oh nice, we got...

3375
02:56:16,730 --> 02:56:17,870
Oh wait, no, we need one more.

3376
02:56:22,420 --> 02:56:23,720
That was crazy.

3377
02:56:23,940 --> 02:56:26,540
That crash was fucking crazy.

3378
02:56:28,440 --> 02:56:29,200
Oh nice.

3379
02:56:29,420 --> 02:56:30,160
Oh, I got three.

3380
02:56:30,340 --> 02:56:30,940
Unlocked three.

3381
02:56:31,760 --> 02:56:33,200
One battle art chain.

3382
02:56:33,300 --> 02:56:35,460
What the fuck is a battle art chain, though?

3383
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:43,000
Attack, attack...

3384
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:44,240
And then, we'll go there.

3385
02:56:46,900 --> 02:56:49,380
The timeline has been changed.

3386
02:56:49,480 --> 02:56:50,700
I saved the rich kid.

3387
02:56:51,140 --> 02:56:52,360
Guys, thank you for the super chat!

3388
02:56:52,440 --> 02:56:53,180
Thank you, thank you!

3389
02:56:53,280 --> 02:56:56,440
PC-san is a true warrior, too, now.

3390
02:56:56,800 --> 02:56:57,560
Thank you for the super chat!

3391
02:56:57,720 --> 02:56:58,520
Thank you, thank you!

3392
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,960
We can't just go against the Grand General's orders, can we?

3393
02:57:16,660 --> 02:57:19,000
Yeah, I know that, but still...

3394
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:24,880
Su Li is right on the Emperor's doorstep, and yet the whole place is gone to hell.

3395
02:57:28,080 --> 02:57:30,100
Take a look around town first.

3396
02:57:31,780 --> 02:57:33,800
Carefully return... Yeah, I won't take a look around.

3397
02:57:34,800 --> 02:57:35,820
See what they say.

3398
02:57:43,230 --> 02:57:44,670
Oh, I know what they're saying.

3399
02:57:46,330 --> 02:57:47,990
Oh, cat!

3400
02:57:48,890 --> 02:57:50,130
Hello, cat.

3401
02:57:51,510 --> 02:57:53,410
What are you doing here?

3402
02:57:57,020 --> 02:57:58,640
Who's she?

3403
02:58:05,910 --> 02:58:06,450
Father?

3404
02:58:21,630 --> 02:58:22,550
These bandits?

3405
02:58:23,690 --> 02:58:25,110
They're wearing a soldier gear.

3406
02:58:29,850 --> 02:58:31,130
Yao Chen?

3407
02:58:32,230 --> 02:58:33,550
They're purple.

3408
02:58:40,070 --> 02:58:41,650
Where'd she go?

3409
02:58:41,930 --> 02:58:42,450
Magic?

3410
02:58:43,310 --> 02:58:44,290
Burn the witch!

3411
02:58:44,290 --> 02:58:44,370
Witch!

3412
02:58:46,510 --> 02:58:47,910
Oh, shit!

3413
02:58:52,030 --> 02:58:53,510
Where's her drumsticks?

3414
02:59:11,630 --> 02:59:13,030
Oh,

3415
02:59:16,050 --> 02:59:16,290
shit!

3416
02:59:16,510 --> 02:59:17,710
That's me!

3417
02:59:22,570 --> 02:59:22,670
Fuck!

3418
02:59:27,750 --> 02:59:28,650
Oh, you're right.

3419
02:59:28,710 --> 02:59:29,590
It was a whip again.

3420
02:59:29,870 --> 02:59:32,570
Okay, Yao Chen's fucking weapons keep changing every time.

3421
02:59:33,470 --> 02:59:35,690
I only remember her the most with the drumsticks.

3422
02:59:36,990 --> 02:59:38,270
Because it was so silly.

3423
02:59:40,630 --> 02:59:42,570
And now she has...

3424
02:59:43,490 --> 02:59:44,130
I don't know...

3425
02:59:44,130 --> 02:59:44,890
A fucking nail?

3426
02:59:46,310 --> 02:59:47,270
One nail!

3427
02:59:52,570 --> 02:59:54,310
That is not efficient at all.

3428
02:59:54,450 --> 02:59:55,130
Where are you?

3429
02:59:57,030 --> 02:59:57,870
One needle.

3430
03:00:00,630 --> 03:00:01,910
What are we gonna do?

3431
03:00:01,970 --> 03:00:05,030
We can't keep going back to the bodies to get that needle.

3432
03:00:14,510 --> 03:00:17,510
How do you know that name?

3433
03:00:18,690 --> 03:00:19,210
Yao Chen?

3434
03:00:20,670 --> 03:00:22,310
Oh, you just guessed that, right?

3435
03:00:36,090 --> 03:00:39,630
Oh, whoops!

3436
03:00:39,710 --> 03:00:40,750
Sorry, I skipped your turn.

3437
03:00:43,130 --> 03:00:45,190
I could say the same to you.

3438
03:00:47,890 --> 03:00:48,950
How old is she?

3439
03:00:49,570 --> 03:00:51,310
Before I say this, guys, I need...

3440
03:00:52,310 --> 03:00:55,570
No, she marries Lu Bu and Dong...

3441
03:00:55,570 --> 03:00:57,450
The Dong, so she should be fine.

3442
03:00:58,310 --> 03:01:04,550
I may not look it, but I served as the governor of Yu Province during the Yellow Turban Rebellion.

3443
03:01:05,410 --> 03:01:13,810
But amidst the chaos, the attendants with connections to the Yellow Turbans managed to soil my name enough for me to be deposed.

3444
03:01:14,710 --> 03:01:20,710
The attendants are mere servants, yet their influence was enough to rob me of my position in such a humiliating way.

3445
03:01:21,250 --> 03:01:22,230
Shame is unbearable.

3446
03:01:23,130 --> 03:01:32,850
I've been traveling the land ever since, searching for a way to put a stop to the attendants' corruption and for men of character to help me do so.

3447
03:01:35,550 --> 03:01:36,590
A way to end corruption?

3448
03:01:37,970 --> 03:01:39,650
During the Three Kingdom Era?

3449
03:01:39,910 --> 03:01:41,030
Good fucking luck!

3450
03:01:41,050 --> 03:01:42,890
My father has lost his position as governor.

3451
03:01:42,890 --> 03:01:47,470
Together, we are but a man and his daughter with little power between us.

3452
03:01:48,170 --> 03:01:51,170
That's why we need someone we can rely on.

3453
03:01:52,810 --> 03:01:59,210
At this very moment, the attendants are fleeing to their despotic grasp.

3454
03:01:59,230 --> 03:02:02,930
Nothing is done to stop them.

3455
03:02:03,450 --> 03:02:06,050
The world will once again fall into chaos.

3456
03:02:07,210 --> 03:02:10,310
Zzluan, I must ask you for one thing.

3457
03:02:10,310 --> 03:02:18,870
If you have not yet chosen a lord to serve, could you travel with me as my guest for a time?

3458
03:02:18,970 --> 03:02:19,790
For money, yeah?

3459
03:02:21,470 --> 03:02:22,010
Sure.

3460
03:02:22,410 --> 03:02:24,210
Tao Chan can protect you.

3461
03:02:27,130 --> 03:02:28,210
You know what?

3462
03:02:28,270 --> 03:02:29,490
She's a strong, independent woman.

3463
03:02:29,790 --> 03:02:32,730
The attackers from before aren't the only ones after our heads.

3464
03:02:33,390 --> 03:02:36,270
The attendants have sent assassins as well.

3465
03:02:37,830 --> 03:02:40,810
I don't believe that they can defeat Tao Chan.

3466
03:02:41,230 --> 03:02:44,170
But the burden is too much for her to bear alone.

3467
03:02:47,070 --> 03:02:48,070
I'll do it.

3468
03:02:48,170 --> 03:02:48,950
I refuse.

3469
03:02:50,330 --> 03:02:51,690
Wait, wait, wait.

3470
03:02:51,970 --> 03:02:53,610
I refuse.

3471
03:02:56,150 --> 03:03:00,250
we will likely be ruthlessly killed after a bitter struggle in the middle of nowhere.

3472
03:03:00,270 --> 03:03:00,930
Okay, cool.

3473
03:03:01,310 --> 03:03:03,790
But we definitely won't hold it against you.

3474
03:03:03,790 --> 03:03:08,550
Please, don't trouble yourself with worries of our safety.

3475
03:03:08,710 --> 03:03:09,030
Okay.

3476
03:03:18,090 --> 03:03:19,250
Oh, wow.

3477
03:03:20,730 --> 03:03:21,310
Manipulation.

3478
03:03:21,590 --> 03:03:23,450
What is this guilt trip?

3479
03:03:23,910 --> 03:03:24,790
Thank you.

3480
03:03:25,670 --> 03:03:27,570
I knew you'd have a change of heart.

3481
03:03:27,770 --> 03:03:28,490
Bro, what do you mean?

3482
03:03:28,550 --> 03:03:30,070
I wasn't even given a choice.

3483
03:03:31,350 --> 03:03:33,290
I can't even say no.

3484
03:03:33,490 --> 03:03:34,710
It was one choice.

3485
03:03:38,090 --> 03:03:40,870
I literally only have one choice.

3486
03:03:41,190 --> 03:03:42,770
Why even give me that choice?

3487
03:03:42,890 --> 03:03:45,210
It might as well just be a continuous dialogue.

3488
03:03:51,010 --> 03:03:55,750
The fact that they even made me choose the one choice is crazy.

3489
03:04:00,070 --> 03:04:04,270
I just took a message for you from someone who said they were with Wang Yun.

3490
03:04:04,890 --> 03:04:05,250
Wang Yun?

3491
03:04:05,690 --> 03:04:09,390
They said Wang Yun is waiting to receive word from a collaborator.

3492
03:04:10,210 --> 03:04:12,970
So he wants you to stay here in town for the time being.

3493
03:04:13,850 --> 03:04:20,490
Also, he has some business to attend to in town, so you should feel free to go and ask him if anything is unclear.

3494
03:04:21,350 --> 03:04:26,450
I'm not sure what this is all about, but please try not to put yourself in too much danger.

3495
03:04:27,330 --> 03:04:28,990
I can't cure you if you're dead.

3496
03:04:29,590 --> 03:04:31,530
Have you even done anything for me?

3497
03:04:34,410 --> 03:04:38,670
He literally has done nothing since becoming my doctor.

3498
03:04:40,570 --> 03:04:41,770
Hello, Diao Chan.

3499
03:04:50,130 --> 03:04:50,910
That's me.

3500
03:04:50,970 --> 03:04:53,870
I am so grateful that you have agreed to help my brother.

3501
03:04:54,290 --> 03:04:54,290
Oh yeah.

3502
03:04:54,350 --> 03:04:55,170
Out of free will.

3503
03:04:55,350 --> 03:04:57,830
Our fates are now bound together.

3504
03:04:59,290 --> 03:05:05,230
If you have any worries or misgivings about what lies ahead, let's talk them over now.

3505
03:05:07,930 --> 03:05:10,090
What about you and Wang Yun?

3506
03:05:10,410 --> 03:05:15,550
He took me in as his daughter, but I am also his student and a loyal servant.

3507
03:05:17,630 --> 03:05:23,050
My father is trying to root out the corruption that the attendants have inflicted on the world.

3508
03:05:23,810 --> 03:05:25,130
I hate to break it to you.

3509
03:05:25,470 --> 03:05:27,390
It's 2025 and he's still here.

3510
03:05:28,270 --> 03:05:29,530
There's still corruption.

3511
03:05:29,530 --> 03:05:31,550
Your dad failed.

3512
03:05:33,430 --> 03:05:35,470
Oh my gosh, she's giving me her life story?

3513
03:05:35,650 --> 03:05:36,370
I was born in a small mountain village.

3514
03:05:37,210 --> 03:05:39,290
It was decided that I would become a spy.

3515
03:05:39,570 --> 03:05:41,150
So I underwent training.

3516
03:05:41,990 --> 03:05:45,510
But one day, a large fire broke out in the village.

3517
03:05:46,530 --> 03:05:48,090
That was when I met Wang Yun.

3518
03:05:49,890 --> 03:05:51,410
I had nowhere to go.

3519
03:05:51,850 --> 03:05:54,030
But he took my hand and led the way.

3520
03:05:54,810 --> 03:05:58,410
He trained me to be the weapon that would rid the world of corruption.

3521
03:05:58,410 --> 03:05:59,830
Oh, it didn't work.

3522
03:06:04,490 --> 03:06:07,790
Should a spy really be sharing that?

3523
03:06:08,250 --> 03:06:11,210
Look, she said she was training to be a spy.

3524
03:06:11,710 --> 03:06:13,770
It didn't mean she was successful.

3525
03:06:14,650 --> 03:06:17,430
Her village burned down before it was too late.

3526
03:06:30,150 --> 03:06:32,050
It didn't mean she passed.

3527
03:06:34,160 --> 03:06:34,670
Oh, what?

3528
03:06:39,490 --> 03:06:40,450
Wait, really?

3529
03:06:42,450 --> 03:06:44,050
Oh yeah, he didn't have a child.

3530
03:06:48,290 --> 03:06:50,930
She never said she was a good spy.

3531
03:06:51,270 --> 03:06:51,750
Spy.

3532
03:06:52,030 --> 03:06:53,210
I am spy.

3533
03:07:13,510 --> 03:07:16,230
Oh my god, we're getting close to just the kingdoms now.

3534
03:07:37,170 --> 03:07:38,990
And your collaborators.

3535
03:07:53,890 --> 03:07:54,970
Yeah,

3536
03:07:58,630 --> 03:08:02,650
but isn't the empress' family also super corrupted?

3537
03:08:05,890 --> 03:08:07,250
I mean, they're all bad.

3538
03:08:07,470 --> 03:08:08,210
I don't fucking know.

3539
03:08:08,250 --> 03:08:08,610
They're all bad.

3540
03:08:08,650 --> 03:08:09,830
As long as they pay me, I'm fine.

3541
03:08:12,110 --> 03:08:14,230
As long as I get paid, oh, who cares?

3542
03:08:14,790 --> 03:08:16,230
They are all probably bad.

3543
03:08:21,020 --> 03:08:22,960
We need war so I can get paid.

3544
03:08:25,860 --> 03:08:27,240
Okay, let's see here.

3545
03:08:29,420 --> 03:08:31,740
Okay, I want to be sure that...

3546
03:08:31,740 --> 03:08:34,120
Alright, let's check the...

3547
03:08:34,120 --> 03:08:35,360
What was it?

3548
03:08:35,460 --> 03:08:37,720
I want to look at...

3549
03:08:38,320 --> 03:08:39,860
My... Oh, there you go.

3550
03:08:39,920 --> 03:08:41,740
Okay, I just finished...

3551
03:08:42,900 --> 03:08:44,180
Finished a lot of them.

3552
03:08:47,280 --> 03:08:50,420
Did I finish everything for one of some of them?

3553
03:08:50,520 --> 03:08:51,240
I don't remember.

3554
03:08:51,420 --> 03:08:51,780
Oh well.

3555
03:08:52,500 --> 03:08:52,840
You know what?

3556
03:08:52,900 --> 03:08:56,220
I should go check on...

3557
03:08:56,220 --> 03:08:57,180
Where's my fast travel?

3558
03:08:57,500 --> 03:08:59,180
I should check the friendship meter.

3559
03:08:59,700 --> 03:09:00,680
Just in case.

3560
03:09:01,660 --> 03:09:03,140
I want to make sure I have no...

3561
03:09:03,140 --> 03:09:04,500
I don't have anybody I need to talk to.

3562
03:09:09,880 --> 03:09:10,580
Okay, no.

3563
03:09:10,800 --> 03:09:12,140
Nobody wants to talk to me.

3564
03:09:12,200 --> 03:09:13,060
Okay, that's...

3565
03:09:13,060 --> 03:09:13,640
That's cool.

3566
03:09:14,460 --> 03:09:15,760
No one wants to talk to me.

3567
03:09:15,780 --> 03:09:16,400
That's okay.

3568
03:09:19,460 --> 03:09:20,620
Alright, let's go here.

3569
03:09:20,780 --> 03:09:21,700
Let's fast travel here.

3570
03:09:26,230 --> 03:09:27,070
Oh, wait!

3571
03:09:27,190 --> 03:09:27,770
What's this?

3572
03:09:29,870 --> 03:09:30,830
Oh, I'm...

3573
03:09:30,830 --> 03:09:31,770
Level 16?!

3574
03:09:32,490 --> 03:09:33,730
I am so under level.

3575
03:09:34,310 --> 03:09:35,270
Holy fuck.

3576
03:09:38,490 --> 03:09:39,150
Oh, wait.

3577
03:09:39,210 --> 03:09:40,150
I missed a new letter?

3578
03:09:42,790 --> 03:09:43,930
What are you thinking?

3579
03:09:44,530 --> 03:09:45,710
Is that what you call yourself now?

3580
03:09:46,130 --> 03:09:50,470
For one of such skill to lose their memories and end up a dog to Wang Yun?

3581
03:09:50,870 --> 03:09:52,490
The irony knows no bound.

3582
03:09:52,850 --> 03:09:53,670
I wonder...

3583
03:09:53,670 --> 03:09:59,890
Was it the allure of that beautiful woman or the habitual servitude that's ingrained in your nature which led to this?

3584
03:09:59,990 --> 03:10:01,070
Oh my god, my first auntie.

3585
03:10:01,310 --> 03:10:03,310
And what became of the other one from your village?

3586
03:10:03,690 --> 03:10:06,550
If it is her absence that has enabled your stupidity.

3587
03:10:06,850 --> 03:10:07,470
How pitiful...

3588
03:10:07,470 --> 03:10:09,830
Oh my god, my first auntie!

3589
03:10:10,210 --> 03:10:12,370
Ye olde dragoon auntie!

3590
03:10:17,190 --> 03:10:18,850
Papa Smurf, thank you for the superchat.

3591
03:10:18,950 --> 03:10:19,690
Thank you, thank you.

3592
03:10:19,750 --> 03:10:22,410
My mom came to visit and I had your meow meow video on.

3593
03:10:23,170 --> 03:10:24,560
Aww, that's so cute!

3594
03:10:25,430 --> 03:10:27,390
Thank you for the superchat, Papa Smurf.

3595
03:10:27,510 --> 03:10:28,110
Thank you, thank you.

3596
03:10:28,190 --> 03:10:29,570
I made it, guys!

3597
03:10:29,830 --> 03:10:32,070
I made it into three kingdoms!

3598
03:10:33,010 --> 03:10:34,250
How pitiful that would be.

3599
03:10:34,390 --> 03:10:38,810
And in case you had best not forget that you only live because of all those who perish.

3600
03:10:39,330 --> 03:10:42,410
Or rather, it would be more apt to say that you had best remember.

3601
03:10:42,550 --> 03:10:44,070
Hey, at least he gave me a superchat.

3602
03:10:44,510 --> 03:10:45,350
At least...

3603
03:10:49,570 --> 03:10:50,530
At least...

3604
03:10:50,530 --> 03:10:51,230
At least...

3605
03:10:51,230 --> 03:10:51,430
At least...

3606
03:10:51,430 --> 03:10:53,570
Guys, he gave me a superchat though!

3607
03:10:53,730 --> 03:10:54,230
You know?

3608
03:10:58,840 --> 03:11:00,880
Oh my god, that was nice.

3609
03:11:00,980 --> 03:11:02,600
He sent a superchat just to hate.

3610
03:11:02,760 --> 03:11:03,860
Just to auntie me.

3611
03:11:07,320 --> 03:11:08,740
He's a hate watcher.

3612
03:11:12,510 --> 03:11:14,410
Alright, I'll make sure he doesn't die.

3613
03:11:14,650 --> 03:11:16,350
Wait, who gave Dao Chan a sword?

3614
03:11:16,890 --> 03:11:18,770
Who gave you a fucking sword?

3615
03:11:18,890 --> 03:11:19,970
What happened to your needle?

3616
03:11:21,850 --> 03:11:22,310
Oh shit.

3617
03:11:23,910 --> 03:11:25,470
Alright, let's get rid of him.

3618
03:11:27,710 --> 03:11:27,930
Alright.

3619
03:11:29,710 --> 03:11:30,830
Get rid of him.

3620
03:11:36,730 --> 03:11:37,250
Nice.

3621
03:11:37,650 --> 03:11:38,130
Do a flip.

3622
03:11:42,790 --> 03:11:43,310
Alright.

3623
03:11:43,830 --> 03:11:46,290
He's just gonna get up and run away.

3624
03:11:48,170 --> 03:11:49,290
Wait, where do I go?

3625
03:11:51,250 --> 03:11:52,470
Do they just follow me?

3626
03:11:52,910 --> 03:11:53,870
Oh, they do.

3627
03:11:54,030 --> 03:11:54,810
They just follow me.

3628
03:11:54,930 --> 03:11:55,110
Okay.

3629
03:11:57,570 --> 03:11:59,030
I choose right side.

3630
03:12:02,050 --> 03:12:02,750
Let's buy.

3631
03:12:06,550 --> 03:12:06,830
Damn.

3632
03:12:09,450 --> 03:12:11,270
They're just doing it for the money, guys.

3633
03:12:11,690 --> 03:12:13,230
It's not black and white.

3634
03:12:13,570 --> 03:12:14,490
They're broke.

3635
03:12:18,070 --> 03:12:18,710
Okay.

3636
03:12:18,890 --> 03:12:20,250
Let's get rid of him too.

3637
03:12:20,690 --> 03:12:21,510
Oh shit.

3638
03:12:23,450 --> 03:12:24,050
Nice.

3639
03:12:24,350 --> 03:12:25,030
Where's the last guy?

3640
03:12:26,090 --> 03:12:27,490
Oh no, don't touch him.

3641
03:12:27,790 --> 03:12:28,550
He's old.

3642
03:12:30,470 --> 03:12:31,490
Okay, nice.

3643
03:12:34,430 --> 03:12:40,190
I wonder if I can like trigger all the ambushes by myself.

3644
03:12:40,190 --> 03:12:42,150
Or do they have to go through?

3645
03:12:45,590 --> 03:12:46,370
Okay, yeah.

3646
03:12:46,450 --> 03:12:47,530
I have to...

3647
03:12:47,530 --> 03:12:49,170
Yeah, I can trigger it myself.

3648
03:12:52,430 --> 03:12:53,750
Look, I'm scouting.

3649
03:12:54,110 --> 03:12:55,550
I'm just scouting, old man.

3650
03:13:00,350 --> 03:13:02,250
Not my fault you don't have a horse.

3651
03:13:03,290 --> 03:13:04,590
How is that my fault?

3652
03:13:17,670 --> 03:13:19,610
I'm sorry, man.

3653
03:13:19,730 --> 03:13:21,230
You're the stupid chat thing.

3654
03:13:22,710 --> 03:13:24,090
No, you're not.

3655
03:13:27,030 --> 03:13:28,370
Oh, look at him.

3656
03:13:40,690 --> 03:13:42,810
Oh man, if only you had a horse.

3657
03:13:44,350 --> 03:13:46,050
Oh man, if only.

3658
03:13:47,390 --> 03:13:49,910
It's too bad you don't have a horse.

3659
03:13:55,550 --> 03:13:56,710
It's too bad.

3660
03:13:56,910 --> 03:13:57,850
It's too bad.

3661
03:14:03,010 --> 03:14:04,470
Alright, let's get him out of here.

3662
03:14:06,450 --> 03:14:07,110
That's fucking right.

3663
03:14:10,490 --> 03:14:12,190
God damn it, I fucked up the parry.

3664
03:14:13,110 --> 03:14:14,990
My parry timing has been off lately.

3665
03:14:17,290 --> 03:14:18,870
Wait, there's another assassin?

3666
03:14:25,170 --> 03:14:28,090
Oh my god, you go for the other assassin.

3667
03:14:28,510 --> 03:14:29,690
You go for the other assassin.

3668
03:14:29,830 --> 03:14:30,910
I have to deal with this.

3669
03:14:32,090 --> 03:14:33,970
Oh my god, he was just beat.

3670
03:14:36,250 --> 03:14:37,670
Diao Chan, save your dad.

3671
03:14:41,310 --> 03:14:44,330
Diao Chan, your fucking dad is getting beat up.

3672
03:14:47,470 --> 03:14:50,710
Jesus Christ, these assassins are so tanky though.

3673
03:14:53,490 --> 03:14:54,910
Oh my god.

3674
03:14:57,790 --> 03:14:59,870
Jesus, you're so tanky.

3675
03:15:02,350 --> 03:15:04,150
Please, he must rest.

3676
03:15:06,230 --> 03:15:06,530
Nice.

3677
03:15:08,230 --> 03:15:09,570
Okay, we got him out.

3678
03:15:10,310 --> 03:15:11,390
Your turn now.

3679
03:15:11,690 --> 03:15:12,270
Get out of here.

3680
03:15:13,230 --> 03:15:14,810
God damn it, I'm missing my parry.

3681
03:15:15,270 --> 03:15:16,390
It's not good.

3682
03:15:18,250 --> 03:15:18,990
That's right.

3683
03:15:19,770 --> 03:15:20,910
There you go, parry!

3684
03:15:21,670 --> 03:15:23,330
My first parry of the day!

3685
03:15:26,790 --> 03:15:27,270
There you go.

3686
03:15:28,410 --> 03:15:29,830
That's right, you thought you could just dash?

3687
03:15:29,830 --> 03:15:29,950
Jesus.

3688
03:15:34,290 --> 03:15:34,730
Alright.

3689
03:15:36,490 --> 03:15:37,510
Are you still resting?

3690
03:15:39,910 --> 03:15:40,830
Mom, where's your horse?

3691
03:15:41,210 --> 03:15:44,030
Man, if only somebody would give their horse for you.

3692
03:15:45,190 --> 03:15:46,210
Poor old man.

3693
03:15:47,710 --> 03:15:48,750
Poor guy.

3694
03:15:54,590 --> 03:15:55,630
Which way are we going?

3695
03:15:55,970 --> 03:15:56,570
Oh, this way?

3696
03:16:04,530 --> 03:16:04,970
Oh.

3697
03:16:05,430 --> 03:16:05,870
Oh.

3698
03:16:05,870 --> 03:16:06,670
Wait, what the fuck?

3699
03:16:07,430 --> 03:16:08,570
How do I get over there?

3700
03:16:11,170 --> 03:16:13,430
Oh, he just drops down!

3701
03:16:13,850 --> 03:16:14,450
Oh, whoops!

3702
03:16:15,990 --> 03:16:17,950
I was like, how do I get out of there?

3703
03:16:17,970 --> 03:16:19,930
And I just run away from them.

3704
03:16:27,070 --> 03:16:27,550
Okay.

3705
03:16:28,150 --> 03:16:28,630
Yeah.

3706
03:16:29,070 --> 03:16:29,810
Trust me.

3707
03:16:30,490 --> 03:16:33,530
I didn't just try to run away from you guys earlier because I fucked up.

3708
03:16:35,870 --> 03:16:37,470
I totally know what I'm doing.

3709
03:16:38,690 --> 03:16:39,270
Okay, nice.

3710
03:16:41,690 --> 03:16:43,590
Oh my god, I think I should've leveled up more.

3711
03:16:43,670 --> 03:16:45,910
My fucking weapons are so bad right now.

3712
03:16:45,910 --> 03:16:46,610
Oh my...

3713
03:16:47,640 --> 03:16:49,070
I'm so weak!

3714
03:16:49,170 --> 03:16:52,030
Everybody takes so long to kill!

3715
03:16:54,150 --> 03:16:54,410
Yeah.

3716
03:16:56,830 --> 03:16:58,230
Another one?!

3717
03:17:01,070 --> 03:17:02,530
Oh my god, Diaochan, please.

3718
03:17:02,910 --> 03:17:04,330
Diaochan, you're not even injured.

3719
03:17:05,930 --> 03:17:08,130
Even if it cost me my life.

3720
03:17:08,470 --> 03:17:09,150
Full HP.

3721
03:17:16,770 --> 03:17:17,650
Got him.

3722
03:17:20,690 --> 03:17:21,210
Alright, nice.

3723
03:17:22,290 --> 03:17:22,950
Alright, just run.

3724
03:17:24,210 --> 03:17:24,850
Ignore him.

3725
03:17:26,690 --> 03:17:28,650
Oh my god, there was an assassin.

3726
03:17:28,770 --> 03:17:29,790
Nevermind, you can't ignore him.

3727
03:17:30,090 --> 03:17:30,390
Sorry.

3728
03:17:30,870 --> 03:17:32,290
I didn't realize.

3729
03:17:32,810 --> 03:17:36,050
Sorry, I didn't realize there was nearly an assassin right in front of you.

3730
03:17:36,690 --> 03:17:39,910
I was gonna be like, ignore the arrows, just run forward.

3731
03:17:40,530 --> 03:17:41,890
The arrows can't do anything.

3732
03:17:44,710 --> 03:17:45,470
Okay, nice.

3733
03:17:47,510 --> 03:17:48,430
Alright, just keep going.

3734
03:17:56,750 --> 03:17:58,850
There should be...

3735
03:17:59,410 --> 03:18:00,810
There has to be another ambush.

3736
03:18:00,950 --> 03:18:02,190
I don't believe we're safe.

3737
03:18:04,490 --> 03:18:05,930
Oh my god, he's so slow.

3738
03:18:06,850 --> 03:18:09,270
I don't understand why he didn't bring his own horse.

3739
03:18:09,830 --> 03:18:11,830
Like, why are you running like a commoner?

3740
03:18:11,990 --> 03:18:13,070
You're literally a noble.

3741
03:18:13,810 --> 03:18:14,970
Like, what happened to you?

3742
03:18:14,970 --> 03:18:16,110
You fell off, old man.

3743
03:18:16,750 --> 03:18:18,210
You fucking fell off, bro.

3744
03:18:27,950 --> 03:18:29,210
We're literally right there.

3745
03:18:29,470 --> 03:18:30,230
Why, diaochan?

3746
03:18:30,390 --> 03:18:31,210
We're right there.

3747
03:18:31,410 --> 03:18:32,510
You should have made him go.

3748
03:18:39,270 --> 03:18:40,290
We're literally right there.

3749
03:18:41,870 --> 03:18:44,870
The exit is literally right there.

3750
03:18:54,270 --> 03:18:58,390
But even the random soldier said you're wrong, diaochan.

3751
03:19:02,890 --> 03:19:03,710
Oh my god.

3752
03:19:03,710 --> 03:19:05,710
Oh my god.

3753
03:19:07,250 --> 03:19:07,830
Alright, c'mon.

3754
03:19:08,010 --> 03:19:08,330
C'mon.

3755
03:19:08,570 --> 03:19:09,490
C'mon, old man.

3756
03:19:10,030 --> 03:19:10,410
C'mon.

3757
03:19:10,610 --> 03:19:11,230
C'mon, run.

3758
03:19:11,970 --> 03:19:12,370
Run.

3759
03:19:12,650 --> 03:19:13,430
That's why you got this.

3760
03:19:13,470 --> 03:19:14,230
You can do this.

3761
03:19:14,830 --> 03:19:16,110
C'mon, you can do this.

3762
03:19:16,130 --> 03:19:17,210
I believe in you.

3763
03:19:17,550 --> 03:19:18,810
Look at you go.

3764
03:19:19,410 --> 03:19:20,630
Look at you go.

3765
03:19:20,670 --> 03:19:22,030
Okay, so resting...

3766
03:19:22,030 --> 03:19:24,110
Oh, it was an ambush.

3767
03:19:27,770 --> 03:19:28,250
Oh.

3768
03:19:29,690 --> 03:19:30,370
Oh.

3769
03:19:30,690 --> 03:19:33,650
It was an ambush this entire time.

3770
03:19:34,070 --> 03:19:35,650
I can't believe it.

3771
03:19:35,710 --> 03:19:37,490
They just lied like that?

3772
03:19:38,450 --> 03:19:40,050
In the battlefield?

3773
03:19:40,350 --> 03:19:41,410
That's so fucked.

3774
03:19:46,810 --> 03:19:48,510
Oh yeah, they already took over.

3775
03:19:59,870 --> 03:20:00,550
That's right.

3776
03:20:00,610 --> 03:20:02,370
It's not difficult when I'm angry.

3777
03:20:12,030 --> 03:20:13,150
Oh no.

3778
03:20:13,510 --> 03:20:13,750
Wait.

3779
03:20:13,930 --> 03:20:15,070
Oh no, not the dog.

3780
03:20:15,590 --> 03:20:16,190
Oh no.

3781
03:20:16,790 --> 03:20:18,130
He saw the pretty lady.

3782
03:20:20,610 --> 03:20:21,590
Wait, Chao Chao?

3783
03:20:22,650 --> 03:20:24,270
I'm breakdancing real quick.

3784
03:20:26,210 --> 03:20:28,130
Wait, what is Chao Chao doing here?

3785
03:20:31,250 --> 03:20:32,430
Chao Chao!

3786
03:20:39,870 --> 03:20:44,450
I did it.

3787
03:20:48,310 --> 03:20:50,830
Wait, what the fuck is Chao Chao doing here?

3788
03:20:52,750 --> 03:20:53,990
Oh shit!

3789
03:20:59,130 --> 03:20:59,870
Oh!

3790
03:20:59,990 --> 03:21:00,470
Whoa!

3791
03:21:00,790 --> 03:21:01,190
Whoa!

3792
03:21:01,430 --> 03:21:01,950
Whoa!

3793
03:21:02,110 --> 03:21:03,150
Whoa!

3794
03:21:03,150 --> 03:21:03,610
Whoa!

3795
03:21:04,110 --> 03:21:04,250
Whoa!

3796
03:21:04,490 --> 03:21:07,330
We're in a battlefield right now.

3797
03:21:07,770 --> 03:21:08,310
Whoa!

3798
03:21:09,090 --> 03:21:10,110
Whoa!

3799
03:21:13,490 --> 03:21:14,530
Whoa!

3800
03:21:17,310 --> 03:21:19,930
Chao Chao, calm down.

3801
03:21:20,490 --> 03:21:22,550
I'm trying to kill somebody.

3802
03:21:25,730 --> 03:21:29,230
It must be destiny that we're here.

3803
03:21:33,190 --> 03:21:35,230
What am I doing?

3804
03:21:35,850 --> 03:21:36,590
Oh, whoops.

3805
03:21:37,110 --> 03:21:37,710
I fucked it up.

3806
03:21:42,470 --> 03:21:42,870
Nice.

3807
03:21:44,930 --> 03:21:45,490
Nice.

3808
03:21:46,710 --> 03:21:47,810
Alright, last guy.

3809
03:21:52,410 --> 03:21:53,890
Don't worry, Chao Chao.

3810
03:21:54,570 --> 03:21:55,690
Watch this.

3811
03:21:55,810 --> 03:21:56,570
It's pretty hot.

3812
03:21:58,490 --> 03:22:00,050
Oh, is that hot?

3813
03:22:02,790 --> 03:22:03,350
Yeah?

3814
03:22:03,710 --> 03:22:05,950
Is this what you mean by destiny?

3815
03:22:07,770 --> 03:22:08,390
Oh shit!

3816
03:22:08,630 --> 03:22:09,050
Oh shit!

3817
03:22:10,970 --> 03:22:11,450
Sorry.

3818
03:22:14,350 --> 03:22:15,410
Get him in here.

3819
03:22:15,790 --> 03:22:16,990
Kill him real quick.

3820
03:22:18,030 --> 03:22:18,510
Whoops.

3821
03:22:20,270 --> 03:22:20,750
Whoa!

3822
03:22:21,530 --> 03:22:22,650
Nice, I dodged it.

3823
03:22:24,850 --> 03:22:26,470
Don't worry, he didn't see that, guys.

3824
03:22:26,550 --> 03:22:27,270
He didn't see that.

3825
03:22:27,330 --> 03:22:27,810
We're fine.

3826
03:22:39,050 --> 03:22:39,270
Ta-da!

3827
03:22:45,230 --> 03:22:45,970
That's right.

3828
03:22:46,130 --> 03:22:47,130
Just us two.

3829
03:22:48,130 --> 03:22:49,090
Nobody else.

3830
03:22:49,890 --> 03:22:51,170
Oh nice, my wheels are stronger.

3831
03:22:52,250 --> 03:22:54,830
Uh, L, Y while evading.

3832
03:22:55,090 --> 03:22:56,730
Oh, I can actually use my evade.

3833
03:23:02,630 --> 03:23:04,470
Okay, plus 15 skill point.

3834
03:23:04,650 --> 03:23:05,370
Oh, I did it!

3835
03:23:05,410 --> 03:23:06,650
I did the battle art chain!

3836
03:23:12,430 --> 03:23:13,390
Okay, uh...

3837
03:23:13,390 --> 03:23:17,070
I wanna upgrade my yellows first before I go on to the next one.

3838
03:23:27,540 --> 03:23:30,980
Lord Wang Yun, I am glad to see you in good health.

3839
03:23:31,160 --> 03:23:34,140
I am here to welcome you on orders from the Grand General.

3840
03:23:34,680 --> 03:23:36,460
I am very grateful.

3841
03:23:37,700 --> 03:23:44,560
We expected assassins, but the bandits were a surprise indeed.

3842
03:23:45,240 --> 03:23:48,780
I must also give my thanks to Lord Dong Zhuo.

3843
03:23:50,000 --> 03:23:51,120
The dog!

3844
03:23:51,120 --> 03:23:52,360
Thank you.

3845
03:23:55,280 --> 03:23:56,720
God, why are you naked?

3846
03:23:57,580 --> 03:23:58,840
Sorry, his face is naked.

3847
03:23:59,140 --> 03:24:00,020
I didn't mean it in any way.

3848
03:24:01,240 --> 03:24:03,420
He's so naked without a mustache.

3849
03:24:03,760 --> 03:24:04,560
So weird.

3850
03:24:06,560 --> 03:24:08,000
We're here at West Dash.

3851
03:24:08,140 --> 03:24:09,340
We should celebrate Lu Bei.

3852
03:24:09,860 --> 03:24:10,620
We're evil.

3853
03:24:21,820 --> 03:24:27,880
I would not disgrace such a fine gathering by showing up as filthy as we are.

3854
03:24:29,000 --> 03:24:30,160
Is that so?

3855
03:24:31,240 --> 03:24:33,740
We've set up camp outside the capital.

3856
03:24:34,300 --> 03:24:36,200
We'll rest our feet there.

3857
03:24:40,430 --> 03:24:43,670
Damn, I like how they put like evil music on him while he talks.

3858
03:24:43,750 --> 03:24:45,830
Like he's not even saying anything evil.

3859
03:24:46,830 --> 03:24:48,630
He's just like, I'll set up camp!

3860
03:24:48,750 --> 03:24:50,950
And they're like, evil music play.

3861
03:24:50,950 --> 03:24:55,090
He's so evil for setting up camp.

3862
03:25:10,950 --> 03:25:13,710
An evil camp.

3863
03:25:20,950 --> 03:25:22,550
The power of a beast.

3864
03:25:23,490 --> 03:25:25,830
You should rest for tonight, Lord Wang Yun.

3865
03:25:26,350 --> 03:25:29,910
We will discuss the future with Grand General He Jin later.

3866
03:25:42,250 --> 03:25:44,730
It's been too long, Luan.

3867
03:25:45,330 --> 03:25:47,590
I knew we would meet again one day.

3868
03:25:48,190 --> 03:25:51,650
But I never expected to see you as a retainer of Lord Wang Yun.

3869
03:25:52,270 --> 03:25:55,870
I am happy that a man of such rank has taken an interest in you.

3870
03:25:56,230 --> 03:25:58,430
But I find it slightly unfortunate as well.

3871
03:26:00,370 --> 03:26:00,970
What?

3872
03:26:00,970 --> 03:26:01,570
Unfortunate?

3873
03:26:01,910 --> 03:26:02,230
Indeed.

3874
03:26:02,770 --> 03:26:04,130
We all feel the same way.

3875
03:26:04,770 --> 03:26:06,270
Lord Wang Yun- Woah!

3876
03:26:06,430 --> 03:26:08,470
I am such a hot commodity!

3877
03:26:09,390 --> 03:26:10,830
Things would have been a lot easier.

3878
03:26:11,350 --> 03:26:12,150
That's for sure.

3879
03:26:12,450 --> 03:26:14,370
Woah, so many offers!

3880
03:26:16,390 --> 03:26:20,710
Our allies in this fight are most notably Lord He Jin and Lord Wang Yun.

3881
03:26:21,650 --> 03:26:26,370
The Yellow Turbans are not long gone and now corruption has taken root at the seat of power.

3882
03:26:26,610 --> 03:26:30,090
We must sever those roots or prepare to face the next Zhang Jiao.

3883
03:26:30,650 --> 03:26:35,530
I don't know how much you already know, but the situation in Luoyang is going to get rough.

3884
03:26:35,750 --> 03:26:37,630
Alright, I'm gonna go to the highest bidder.

3885
03:26:37,690 --> 03:26:38,970
You're going to the capital too, right?

3886
03:26:39,630 --> 03:26:42,730
If we both make it out alive, I hope we meet again.

3887
03:26:45,310 --> 03:26:48,650
Oh my god, oh there's so many choices guys!

3888
03:26:49,150 --> 03:26:50,710
So many choices!

3889
03:26:51,270 --> 03:26:52,930
Which one do I go to?

3890
03:26:52,970 --> 03:26:54,790
I could be the fourth brother.

3891
03:26:55,310 --> 03:26:59,090
I could be Xiao Xiao's other short king.

3892
03:27:01,270 --> 03:27:03,250
We don't talk about the Sun family.

3893
03:27:04,530 --> 03:27:05,870
So many choices!

3894
03:27:10,530 --> 03:27:12,730
We could go with the Deng.

3895
03:27:14,670 --> 03:27:17,750
I can be the Deng's Deng?

3896
03:27:18,370 --> 03:27:18,970
Woah!

3897
03:27:20,070 --> 03:27:20,910
Woah!

3898
03:27:22,130 --> 03:27:23,450
Let's talk about the Emperor.

3899
03:27:51,490 --> 03:27:53,470
Yeah, but then there's the other one.

3900
03:27:53,590 --> 03:27:56,030
The Empress's family.

3901
03:28:07,010 --> 03:28:10,750
If I don't go to Tao, you only get one clap!

3902
03:28:11,170 --> 03:28:11,950
I'm so hyped!

3903
03:28:16,110 --> 03:28:20,090
I like how that's supposed to be my motivation to pick Tao Tao.

3904
03:28:20,450 --> 03:28:27,230
They're like, don't you want to look at Xiao Hu Dan's one eye patch though?

3905
03:28:32,430 --> 03:28:36,490
His sexy one eye!

3906
03:28:44,590 --> 03:28:50,350
Guys, I'm gonna tell you guys now, I'm picking Xu so I can see how hot Zhuge Liang is.

3907
03:28:52,610 --> 03:28:56,450
And then I wanna see Pangtong die for the 8th time.

3908
03:28:56,630 --> 03:29:00,350
Or not even 8th, for the 13th time.

3909
03:29:09,910 --> 03:29:11,650
Be careful out there.

3910
03:29:21,090 --> 03:29:23,610
Good night and sweet dreams.

3911
03:29:29,850 --> 03:29:32,050
That's like literally my only motivation.

3912
03:29:32,410 --> 03:29:34,390
I'm here to see how hot Kongming is.

3913
03:29:34,870 --> 03:29:38,090
And, um, oh this is a fancier inn.

3914
03:29:38,610 --> 03:29:41,310
And, um, Pangtong's death yet again.

3915
03:29:42,890 --> 03:29:46,090
I think the worst part is that- Sorry, spoiler alert!

3916
03:29:47,650 --> 03:29:52,790
They always bait you that you could potentially save him, but he is never the worst.

3917
03:29:53,070 --> 03:29:54,250
Like, it's a canon event.

3918
03:29:54,590 --> 03:30:00,010
So like, even if you do everything you can to save him, he will always die.

3919
03:30:00,130 --> 03:30:02,550
Like, they'll just be like, they just give you a cutscene.

3920
03:30:02,670 --> 03:30:09,910
Like, I had one moment where I actually save- saved him, and then like, killed the people that were trying to kill him.

3921
03:30:10,130 --> 03:30:13,650
And then I killed him, and then they just cutscene kill him off.

3922
03:30:13,750 --> 03:30:14,810
And I was like, what the fuck?

3923
03:30:15,770 --> 03:30:19,510
I was just like, oh my god, this is it.

3924
03:30:19,690 --> 03:30:21,510
I'm gonna change canon!

3925
03:30:21,870 --> 03:30:25,550
And then they literally- he just fucking gets a heart attack and dies.

3926
03:30:25,810 --> 03:30:28,370
And I was like, what the- what's the point?

3927
03:30:37,590 --> 03:30:39,330
Rebellion of the Ten Attendants.

3928
03:30:39,650 --> 03:30:44,650
Oh, is this where- oh shit, I'm at the- I'm at the imperial court already.

3929
03:30:44,790 --> 03:30:46,550
Oh my god, they took me here?

3930
03:30:46,830 --> 03:30:47,910
Oh, hey there.

3931
03:30:53,250 --> 03:30:55,410
Defeat 50 foes while in rage mode.

3932
03:30:55,410 --> 03:30:57,050
Defeat while using a portal.

3933
03:30:57,730 --> 03:30:59,610
Defeat 50 foes while using- oh.

3934
03:31:01,710 --> 03:31:03,990
Oh shit, this is my route.

3935
03:31:04,510 --> 03:31:06,070
This is- there's my route right there.

3936
03:31:07,290 --> 03:31:08,330
Oh, I didn't unlock this?

3937
03:31:10,790 --> 03:31:11,490
Sili Province.

3938
03:31:11,770 --> 03:31:12,690
I love that name.

3939
03:31:13,710 --> 03:31:14,950
It's so silly.

3940
03:31:15,990 --> 03:31:22,070
I don't know why it's such a- It's such a good name, Sili Province.

3941
03:31:22,950 --> 03:31:23,970
What is new?

3942
03:31:25,590 --> 03:31:27,630
Oh, the weak swords are new.

3943
03:31:31,270 --> 03:31:31,790
Um...

3944
03:31:33,070 --> 03:31:33,850
Oh, what?

3945
03:31:34,050 --> 03:31:36,250
Jump up while spinning, thrusting forward.

3946
03:31:37,090 --> 03:31:39,590
Use the wheels and you're holding a sweet to sweep at.

3947
03:31:39,770 --> 03:31:41,470
Oh wait, I'll buy this.

3948
03:31:44,110 --> 03:31:45,990
It's full of whimsical silly.

3949
03:31:48,570 --> 03:31:50,510
I wanna get rid of this, I feel like.

3950
03:31:52,550 --> 03:31:53,930
Yeah, we'll try that.

3951
03:31:56,790 --> 03:31:57,950
Wait, that's so cool.

3952
03:32:03,200 --> 03:32:05,360
I don't know why I wanna...

3953
03:32:06,840 --> 03:32:07,320
Huh.

3954
03:32:08,080 --> 03:32:09,840
Crawling dragon seems- Okay.

3955
03:32:14,880 --> 03:32:15,360
Uh...

3956
03:32:15,360 --> 03:32:18,500
The tornado- Use the wheels you're holding to sweep at anything around you.

3957
03:32:18,580 --> 03:32:21,500
Able to stop certain attacks and stagger the enemy.

3958
03:32:21,580 --> 03:32:23,180
Okay, we're gonna do that.

3959
03:32:23,420 --> 03:32:26,340
There's so many choices though, so it's hard to pick.

3960
03:32:27,840 --> 03:32:30,480
Restore health by 5% when- Okay, we're gonna do that.

3961
03:32:30,700 --> 03:32:32,620
We always like kill people anyway.

3962
03:32:34,700 --> 03:32:35,740
Actually, uh...

3963
03:32:35,740 --> 03:32:37,600
There was one...

3964
03:32:38,780 --> 03:32:39,740
Damage boost.

3965
03:32:39,920 --> 03:32:42,540
Where's the one where like- Yeah, we'll try this one.

3966
03:32:45,760 --> 03:32:46,280
Uh...

3967
03:32:46,280 --> 03:32:47,240
Okay, where are my objectives?

3968
03:32:47,720 --> 03:32:50,060
Let's try and get some objectives done actually.

3969
03:32:51,960 --> 03:32:52,480
Uh...

3970
03:32:52,480 --> 03:32:55,620
Oh, let's do- Okay, full with spear.

3971
03:32:55,760 --> 03:32:56,060
Okay.

3972
03:32:56,260 --> 03:33:02,600
We're gonna- Let me get out my spear and raise my relationship with Guan Yun.

3973
03:33:02,980 --> 03:33:08,220
Let me- Let me- Wait, I think I can buy- I can buy the strong spear.

3974
03:33:10,060 --> 03:33:10,620
Uh...

3975
03:33:10,620 --> 03:33:11,980
I should have the spear.

3976
03:33:12,080 --> 03:33:12,220
Okay.

3977
03:33:13,500 --> 03:33:14,060
Yeah.

3978
03:33:14,240 --> 03:33:14,520
Alright.

3979
03:33:15,200 --> 03:33:17,320
Don't say it like that!

3980
03:33:21,060 --> 03:33:21,620
Alright.

3981
03:33:21,620 --> 03:33:21,840
Okay.

3982
03:33:22,480 --> 03:33:23,440
I got it.

3983
03:33:23,840 --> 03:33:24,300
I'm sorry.

3984
03:33:25,020 --> 03:33:27,660
Guys, I have to unlock more of the route!

3985
03:33:28,720 --> 03:33:30,340
I need to unlock the Guan Yun route!

3986
03:33:34,760 --> 03:33:35,700
Alright, rich man.

3987
03:33:56,400 --> 03:33:57,120
Okay.

3988
03:33:57,120 --> 03:33:59,640
He's gonna steal your mustache, Yuan Shao.

3989
03:34:21,900 --> 03:34:22,460
Hmm...

3990
03:34:22,460 --> 03:34:23,620
Where is the Grand General?

3991
03:34:24,100 --> 03:34:26,760
We are here to meet him, but he is nowhere to be seen.

3992
03:34:27,520 --> 03:34:30,280
Gentlemen, please excuse the interruption.

3993
03:34:30,940 --> 03:34:33,680
I have a message for you from my father, Wang Yun.

3994
03:34:34,580 --> 03:34:38,040
Lord He Jin has been summoned to the palace by Imperial decree.

3995
03:34:38,920 --> 03:34:41,700
Please, make haste to the Imperial court.

3996
03:34:43,280 --> 03:34:43,840
What?

3997
03:34:44,240 --> 03:34:45,540
To the Imperial court?

3998
03:34:45,840 --> 03:34:49,060
We are to dive into that snake's den with those attendants?

3999
03:34:49,620 --> 03:34:53,660
It may well be a trap, but one cannot refuse a decree.

4000
03:34:53,720 --> 03:34:54,240
Come on!

4001
03:34:54,420 --> 03:34:55,620
What's so wrong about that?

4002
03:34:55,620 --> 03:34:56,520
You have me!

4003
03:34:57,460 --> 03:35:00,780
I'm literally like the secret fourth brother!

4004
03:35:01,360 --> 03:35:01,840
Oh, alright.

4005
03:35:02,000 --> 03:35:04,020
He's being held captive by the attendants of the palace!

4006
03:35:04,020 --> 03:35:05,500
Oh, you're such an idiot, He Jin.

4007
03:35:06,340 --> 03:35:06,820
Already?

4008
03:35:07,060 --> 03:35:10,080
You literally just got the message and you're already captured?

4009
03:35:10,380 --> 03:35:12,180
That was not even like 10 seconds!

4010
03:35:12,680 --> 03:35:14,840
But the die has already been cast.

4011
03:35:15,640 --> 03:35:17,720
There is no turning back now.

4012
03:35:18,900 --> 03:35:21,140
How did he get captured in 10 seconds?

4013
03:35:21,500 --> 03:35:24,160
Bring the attendants to justice in Lord He Jin's name.

4014
03:35:26,120 --> 03:35:31,320
Yeah, Chen literally came over and was like, alright, he's over there, he's heading there, and then the other guy was just like, by the way, he's fucking...

4015
03:35:31,320 --> 03:35:31,940
Alright, bye.

4016
03:35:32,360 --> 03:35:32,800
Oh, nice!

4017
03:35:33,000 --> 03:35:35,640
Oh my god, the cool... Oh, no, no, we're not going alone.

4018
03:35:38,620 --> 03:35:42,420
I'm fucking crazy for trying to go alone without...

4019
03:35:44,440 --> 03:35:45,160
the Shahooden?

4020
03:35:45,160 --> 03:35:50,020
Oh my god, guys, I'm in front of a celebrity right now.

4021
03:35:51,340 --> 03:35:52,900
Alright, let's begin battle.

4022
03:35:54,040 --> 03:35:56,580
Oh my god, this man is an actual celebrity.

4023
03:36:05,430 --> 03:36:06,550
He's so cool.

4024
03:36:13,410 --> 03:36:13,950
Oh?

4025
03:36:15,150 --> 03:36:15,550
Oh?

4026
03:36:15,550 --> 03:36:19,270
Oh, I can bring a horse inside the fortress.

4027
03:36:22,390 --> 03:36:22,790
Okay.

4028
03:36:24,170 --> 03:36:26,130
Okay, I need to use my...

4029
03:36:26,650 --> 03:36:27,690
Oh, not that.

4030
03:36:27,750 --> 03:36:28,050
Okay.

4031
03:36:29,750 --> 03:36:31,450
Alright, I was like, what am I doing?

4032
03:36:32,990 --> 03:36:33,670
Oh, shit.

4033
03:36:34,270 --> 03:36:35,670
I need to use more of my battle.

4034
03:36:35,850 --> 03:36:36,590
Oh my god, fuck!

4035
03:36:37,830 --> 03:36:38,510
Okay, nice.

4036
03:36:39,130 --> 03:36:39,430
Hey.

4037
03:36:41,330 --> 03:36:42,090
There you go.

4038
03:36:42,170 --> 03:36:42,590
Goodbye.

4039
03:36:43,510 --> 03:36:45,470
This is for Guanyun!

4040
03:36:53,050 --> 03:36:54,650
Oh, thank you for the super chat!

4041
03:36:54,750 --> 03:36:55,650
Thank you!

4042
03:36:55,650 --> 03:36:55,690
Thank you!

4043
03:37:03,310 --> 03:37:03,910
Oh,

4044
03:37:07,070 --> 03:37:07,890
I hated this.

4045
03:37:08,150 --> 03:37:09,370
Oh, they're doing this map?

4046
03:37:10,470 --> 03:37:11,450
I hated this.

4047
03:37:11,550 --> 03:37:13,430
This was like so confusing for little me.

4048
03:37:15,110 --> 03:37:16,010
Oh, no.

4049
03:37:16,390 --> 03:37:18,190
Not the hidden passage.

4050
03:37:18,530 --> 03:37:19,790
Oh, no.

4051
03:37:20,430 --> 03:37:22,130
Where is it?

4052
03:37:23,010 --> 03:37:24,130
How do I find...

4053
03:37:24,870 --> 03:37:26,070
How do I find...

4054
03:37:26,070 --> 03:37:26,710
Is it this?

4055
03:37:27,650 --> 03:37:30,130
How do I find...

4056
03:37:30,930 --> 03:37:31,850
Boom, boom, boom.

4057
03:37:32,070 --> 03:37:32,930
Boom, boom, boom.

4058
03:37:33,770 --> 03:37:36,130
How do you...

4059
03:37:38,130 --> 03:37:38,610
Oh.

4060
03:37:39,510 --> 03:37:41,630
Oh my god, I'm so fucking stupid.

4061
03:37:42,250 --> 03:37:44,730
I forgot the power of freedom.

4062
03:37:48,750 --> 03:37:50,670
With the power of freedom!

4063
03:37:58,850 --> 03:38:04,810
I did it.

4064
03:38:05,950 --> 03:38:07,890
I used the power of freedom.

4065
03:38:13,910 --> 03:38:14,550
That's fucking right.

4066
03:38:14,550 --> 03:38:15,350
I'm getting over it.

4067
03:38:15,590 --> 03:38:16,250
That's right.

4068
03:38:16,750 --> 03:38:21,370
You're gonna die by my hands for Guanyun's relationship route.

4069
03:38:24,070 --> 03:38:27,010
I'm doing it for one thing and one thing only.

4070
03:38:28,310 --> 03:38:30,530
Jesus Christ, I could have just opened the door.

4071
03:38:34,010 --> 03:38:38,850
Is that it?

4072
03:38:38,850 --> 03:38:38,950
Is that it?

4073
03:38:46,790 --> 03:38:50,250
But the coolness factor, the Doki don't understand.

4074
03:38:50,790 --> 03:38:52,230
It wouldn't look as cool.

4075
03:38:54,830 --> 03:38:55,950
Alright, open up.

4076
03:38:57,070 --> 03:38:58,610
I can't use my hands for that.

4077
03:38:58,710 --> 03:38:59,370
That's for common.

4078
03:39:00,090 --> 03:39:01,270
I was like...

4079
03:39:01,270 --> 03:39:06,230
I was like... Alright, open up.

4080
03:39:06,230 --> 03:39:07,110
Alright, guys.

4081
03:39:08,530 --> 03:39:09,270
Do it for me.

4082
03:39:09,330 --> 03:39:10,670
Can't dirty these hands.

4083
03:39:22,170 --> 03:39:23,230
Alright, let's go.

4084
03:39:30,390 --> 03:39:31,750
Alright, let's go.

4085
03:39:33,130 --> 03:39:35,010
For my relationship route!

4086
03:39:36,970 --> 03:39:39,870
I need to use my battle arts too.

4087
03:39:40,850 --> 03:39:41,430
That was easy.

4088
03:39:43,130 --> 03:39:44,350
Is that it?

4089
03:39:44,770 --> 03:39:45,590
Wait, they're all dead.

4090
03:39:45,910 --> 03:39:46,630
That was so easy.

4091
03:39:47,030 --> 03:39:48,570
They're already all dead!

4092
03:39:49,390 --> 03:39:50,090
Where do I go?

4093
03:39:50,950 --> 03:39:51,750
Oh, this way.

4094
03:39:52,790 --> 03:39:53,750
Wait, who do I follow?

4095
03:40:10,030 --> 03:40:11,190
Oh, shit.

4096
03:40:11,790 --> 03:40:12,690
Oh, shit.

4097
03:40:15,250 --> 03:40:15,710
That's fine.

4098
03:40:15,890 --> 03:40:16,250
That's fine.

4099
03:40:17,110 --> 03:40:18,370
I know what I'm doing.

4100
03:40:19,770 --> 03:40:20,790
Oh, shit!

4101
03:40:20,810 --> 03:40:21,470
You saw that?

4102
03:40:21,590 --> 03:40:23,490
That was a sick move right there.

4103
03:40:26,910 --> 03:40:28,810
Wait, he got murdered already?

4104
03:40:37,730 --> 03:40:38,330
Okay.

4105
03:40:39,670 --> 03:40:40,810
I'll kill him though.

4106
03:40:41,470 --> 03:40:43,230
Wait, when did he die?

4107
03:40:50,650 --> 03:40:54,090
This fight hasn't even been 5 minutes and he's already dead?

4108
03:40:58,450 --> 03:40:59,510
Oh my god, no.

4109
03:40:59,590 --> 03:41:00,550
Not another magician.

4110
03:41:02,050 --> 03:41:02,750
Let's go.

4111
03:41:06,630 --> 03:41:08,370
Oh, Chow Chow will be okay.

4112
03:41:08,630 --> 03:41:09,610
He'll be fine.

4113
03:41:10,310 --> 03:41:12,610
He'll be so fine.

4114
03:41:12,810 --> 03:41:13,870
We don't need to help him, right?

4115
03:41:21,170 --> 03:41:22,510
Okay, one of the ten...

4116
03:41:22,510 --> 03:41:23,170
Oh, okay.

4117
03:41:23,950 --> 03:41:24,290
Nice.

4118
03:41:25,970 --> 03:41:26,850
Wait, he got stronger!

4119
03:41:27,450 --> 03:41:28,010
Wait, how?

4120
03:41:28,010 --> 03:41:29,090
You're a nerd!

4121
03:41:32,950 --> 03:41:33,690
It's okay.

4122
03:41:34,210 --> 03:41:39,450
I like how Chow Chow just has to deal with magic and I'm just fighting.

4123
03:41:39,730 --> 03:41:43,690
He's just like... He doesn't even have any enemies with him, so he should be fine.

4124
03:41:45,370 --> 03:41:47,010
He's a strong nerd.

4125
03:41:48,070 --> 03:41:48,710
Get out of here.

4126
03:41:49,090 --> 03:41:50,490
Now it's not attendance.

4127
03:41:51,030 --> 03:41:52,170
You gotta rename yourself.

4128
03:41:59,110 --> 03:42:00,530
Yeah, I'm just fighting bureaucrats.

4129
03:42:00,630 --> 03:42:02,470
Yeah, I was like, these are just politicians.

4130
03:42:04,830 --> 03:42:06,470
How could they get stronger?

4131
03:42:10,810 --> 03:42:12,090
Oh, wait, I can't go here.

4132
03:42:17,930 --> 03:42:18,970
What is he fighting?

4133
03:42:19,130 --> 03:42:19,950
Who are you fighting?

4134
03:42:22,310 --> 03:42:23,070
Who is this guy?

4135
03:42:23,190 --> 03:42:24,270
Okay, we gotta save Chow Chow.

4136
03:42:24,370 --> 03:42:24,970
Oh shit, okay.

4137
03:42:25,770 --> 03:42:28,790
Chow Chow's the one that's actually fighting someone.

4138
03:42:29,990 --> 03:42:31,170
Okay, I gotta get through here.

4139
03:42:37,470 --> 03:42:39,330
Wait, there's actual people here?

4140
03:42:49,170 --> 03:42:51,210
Oh no, not a secret!

4141
03:42:51,430 --> 03:42:52,930
There's always secret passages!

4142
03:42:56,470 --> 03:42:57,170
Come on.

4143
03:42:58,090 --> 03:43:00,490
Oh my god, I am not parrying!

4144
03:43:07,210 --> 03:43:08,270
God damn it!

4145
03:43:10,170 --> 03:43:11,730
Okay, nice.

4146
03:43:13,990 --> 03:43:15,930
Oh my god, Chow Chow defeated the magician!

4147
03:43:17,070 --> 03:43:19,010
Okay, there is... Wait, what?

4148
03:43:19,010 --> 03:43:20,090
What?

4149
03:43:20,390 --> 03:43:24,810
How is he getting there?

4150
03:43:26,250 --> 03:43:27,350
Oh god, he disappeared.

4151
03:43:27,710 --> 03:43:28,470
Disappear!

4152
03:43:29,090 --> 03:43:31,530
Okay, where's the entrance to this guy?

4153
03:43:34,570 --> 03:43:36,030
Where's the secret door?

4154
03:43:37,310 --> 03:43:38,250
It's here.

4155
03:43:38,910 --> 03:43:40,130
Alright, peekaboo!

4156
03:43:40,950 --> 03:43:43,070
Knock, knock!

4157
03:43:44,750 --> 03:43:46,470
I know your secret.

4158
03:43:49,070 --> 03:43:49,790
Hello?

4159
03:43:50,330 --> 03:43:51,710
Oh my god!

4160
03:43:52,050 --> 03:43:53,130
What the fuck?

4161
03:43:53,290 --> 03:43:54,350
Okay, I...

4162
03:43:54,350 --> 03:43:59,630
Oh, it's such a shame that the treasure room had no treasure.

4163
03:44:00,530 --> 03:44:02,650
Such a shame, guys, right?

4164
03:44:03,450 --> 03:44:07,490
There was no treasure in here when I got here, guys.

4165
03:44:07,710 --> 03:44:08,790
None at all.

4166
03:44:12,690 --> 03:44:19,570
Oh man, what a shame when I got here, all the treasure was gone.

4167
03:44:21,250 --> 03:44:22,450
Oh man!

4168
03:44:24,050 --> 03:44:26,210
Truly is a shame.

4169
03:44:27,250 --> 03:44:28,950
What a travesty.

4170
03:44:29,830 --> 03:44:31,130
Not a single...

4171
03:44:31,130 --> 03:44:33,350
Oh man, the attendants, they stole them all, guys.

4172
03:44:33,950 --> 03:44:35,530
It's actually crazy.

4173
03:44:35,750 --> 03:44:40,690
When I got there, that one attendant that we were trying to find, he was just gone.

4174
03:44:40,970 --> 03:44:42,430
I have no idea where he went.

4175
03:44:43,090 --> 03:44:43,690
What?

4176
03:44:44,430 --> 03:44:46,290
This will help with...

4177
03:44:48,090 --> 03:44:48,690
Yeah!

4178
03:44:49,130 --> 03:44:51,730
Oh my god, the attendants were so fast.

4179
03:44:55,790 --> 03:44:56,390
Like...

4180
03:44:56,390 --> 03:44:59,370
What would I do with all that gold?

4181
03:44:59,650 --> 03:45:01,330
Oh my god, I keep doing the wrong fucking move.

4182
03:45:05,970 --> 03:45:06,570
Shit.

4183
03:45:09,150 --> 03:45:10,030
That's what I could find.

4184
03:45:11,050 --> 03:45:12,330
That's right, get up there.

4185
03:45:13,370 --> 03:45:15,970
Okay, we gotta get the seventh attendant?

4186
03:45:16,150 --> 03:45:17,010
God, I killed so many.

4187
03:45:18,090 --> 03:45:19,470
How are they...

4188
03:45:20,110 --> 03:45:20,470
Shit!

4189
03:45:20,570 --> 03:45:22,870
Oh fuck, okay, that's fine, that's fine, that's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

4190
03:45:23,210 --> 03:45:23,850
I have bread.

4191
03:45:25,710 --> 03:45:26,470
Oh, nice.

4192
03:45:27,250 --> 03:45:27,610
Parried?

4193
03:45:27,610 --> 03:45:28,250
Not really.

4194
03:45:28,790 --> 03:45:29,710
Now I parried.

4195
03:45:30,610 --> 03:45:30,990
There we go.

4196
03:45:32,510 --> 03:45:33,470
Come on, get out of here.

4197
03:45:33,610 --> 03:45:37,470
Jesus Christ, why were there ten?!

4198
03:45:38,730 --> 03:45:40,850
I couldn't be like, I don't know, five.

4199
03:45:41,750 --> 03:45:42,510
Okay, nice.

4200
03:45:43,450 --> 03:45:44,130
Oh shit.

4201
03:45:44,410 --> 03:45:45,350
Oh, Tata, I'm coming to work.

4202
03:45:45,670 --> 03:45:47,110
Give me a sec, let me get this one attendant.

4203
03:45:47,750 --> 03:45:49,750
Please, you can't die to a bureaucrat!

4204
03:45:52,830 --> 03:45:53,830
Wait, how do I get there?

4205
03:45:56,730 --> 03:45:58,970
Wait, how do I get there?

4206
03:46:01,550 --> 03:46:02,270
Oh no.

4207
03:46:03,030 --> 03:46:03,970
Wait, this is bad.

4208
03:46:03,990 --> 03:46:05,090
I don't know how to get over.

4209
03:46:05,090 --> 03:46:06,870
Oh wait, it was this way.

4210
03:46:07,110 --> 03:46:07,410
Whoops.

4211
03:46:08,610 --> 03:46:08,950
Whoops.

4212
03:46:09,130 --> 03:46:10,550
Sorry, I went the wrong way.

4213
03:46:11,790 --> 03:46:15,190
Oh my god, Tata, how could you just die to a bureaucrat?

4214
03:46:15,570 --> 03:46:16,850
He doesn't do anything!

4215
03:46:18,630 --> 03:46:20,090
Okay, let's see, where are you?

4216
03:46:21,350 --> 03:46:22,870
Where the fuck are you?

4217
03:46:24,870 --> 03:46:26,610
Wait, actually, where is he?

4218
03:46:27,210 --> 03:46:27,910
Is he here?

4219
03:46:30,010 --> 03:46:31,370
Wait, where are you?

4220
03:46:32,630 --> 03:46:33,550
Wait, did he run?

4221
03:46:35,470 --> 03:46:35,950
Tata?

4222
03:46:37,610 --> 03:46:38,470
Wait, what?

4223
03:46:38,790 --> 03:46:39,350
Wait, what?

4224
03:46:40,310 --> 03:46:41,430
Just ran away!

4225
03:46:44,530 --> 03:46:46,230
Oh my god, he's right here.

4226
03:46:49,870 --> 03:46:51,410
There you go, get out of that sky.

4227
03:46:52,110 --> 03:46:53,350
Sky is for birds.

4228
03:46:55,310 --> 03:46:56,010
Yo, he's fine.

4229
03:46:57,050 --> 03:46:58,770
Yeah, he literally—you're so fine.

4230
03:46:58,850 --> 03:46:59,470
You're so healthy.

4231
03:47:00,070 --> 03:47:03,310
He literally ran away because he was like, this isn't a challenge anymore.

4232
03:47:05,910 --> 03:47:06,910
Alright, nice.

4233
03:47:08,250 --> 03:47:09,430
Wait, I can change characters.

4234
03:47:11,790 --> 03:47:12,190
There we go.

4235
03:47:12,510 --> 03:47:14,350
I can play an actual real person now.

4236
03:47:17,430 --> 03:47:19,110
Oh my god!

4237
03:47:19,570 --> 03:47:22,550
Finally, I'm playing the real game!

4238
03:47:23,250 --> 03:47:24,830
Oh my god!

4239
03:47:27,590 --> 03:47:29,970
I'm playing a real game now.

4240
03:47:29,970 --> 03:47:31,370
Let's go!

4241
03:47:32,290 --> 03:47:34,090
The real Dynasty Warriors.

4242
03:47:35,650 --> 03:47:36,810
That's fucking right.

4243
03:47:37,070 --> 03:47:38,030
I have two eyes!

4244
03:47:39,650 --> 03:47:41,570
I'm literally so strong!

4245
03:47:49,870 --> 03:47:50,750
Nice.

4246
03:47:51,370 --> 03:47:52,230
We got the other tenant.

4247
03:47:53,670 --> 03:47:55,150
Okay, let's...

4248
03:47:55,150 --> 03:47:56,310
open the door.

4249
03:47:56,310 --> 03:48:00,110
My commoner hands won't touch the door.

4250
03:48:01,990 --> 03:48:03,730
Oh my god, he's so cool.

4251
03:48:03,970 --> 03:48:05,670
He's so fucking cool.

4252
03:48:05,670 --> 03:48:07,390
Oh my god, no!

4253
03:48:08,270 --> 03:48:10,410
No, don't leave it to him!

4254
03:48:11,130 --> 03:48:12,670
It's not as cool!

4255
03:48:16,810 --> 03:48:19,870
No, why do we leave it to him?

4256
03:48:20,750 --> 03:48:23,170
But he's not as cool though.

4257
03:48:25,290 --> 03:48:26,330
Okay, nice.

4258
03:48:26,690 --> 03:48:27,230
Get out of here.

4259
03:48:29,130 --> 03:48:30,890
Okay, we actually need more bread.

4260
03:48:32,470 --> 03:48:32,930
Good guy.

4261
03:48:34,790 --> 03:48:35,830
Where's the other tenant?

4262
03:48:37,590 --> 03:48:39,110
I guess I have to open this.

4263
03:48:43,450 --> 03:48:44,170
Ooh.

4264
03:48:45,630 --> 03:48:47,090
Where are you?

4265
03:48:47,650 --> 03:48:48,170
Yeah?

4266
03:48:48,630 --> 03:48:50,150
You're not one of them?

4267
03:48:51,470 --> 03:48:52,890
That's what a liar would say.

4268
03:48:53,010 --> 03:48:53,410
Get out of here.

4269
03:48:53,850 --> 03:48:55,310
That's fucking right, I knew it.

4270
03:48:55,790 --> 03:48:57,230
I fucking knew it.

4271
03:48:58,510 --> 03:49:00,610
I don't believe in bureaucrats.

4272
03:49:00,770 --> 03:49:04,470
You think a politician would tell that truth?

4273
03:49:05,350 --> 03:49:06,710
That's fucking right.

4274
03:49:08,230 --> 03:49:15,430
I don't believe in poli- Yeah, why is your health bar red?

4275
03:49:17,230 --> 03:49:18,270
I hate it.

4276
03:49:19,010 --> 03:49:21,130
Oh my god, kill the defenseless man.

4277
03:49:21,570 --> 03:49:27,910
Oh my- The last guy to die, kill a defenseless man.

4278
03:49:30,190 --> 03:49:32,030
That's fucking right, I'll do it again.

4279
03:49:33,670 --> 03:49:36,290
Could a bureaucrat do a perfect parry?

4280
03:49:37,190 --> 03:49:38,990
That's right, I don't think so.

4281
03:49:48,720 --> 03:49:49,260
Nice.

4282
03:49:51,580 --> 03:49:54,300
My horse takes fucking forever to level up, though.

4283
03:49:55,960 --> 03:49:57,040
350 enemies.

4284
03:49:57,200 --> 03:49:59,400
Wait, I haven't unlocked anything for Guan Yun yet!

4285
03:50:03,650 --> 03:50:05,130
I thought I did so much!

4286
03:50:08,780 --> 03:50:10,740
Alright, back to the Dong camp.

4287
03:50:20,790 --> 03:50:23,690
Hmm, just as I expected.

4288
03:50:24,750 --> 03:50:28,130
Looks like we've caught something valuable this time.

4289
03:50:29,570 --> 03:50:31,090
It's time for the evil camp, guys.

4290
03:50:31,090 --> 03:50:31,310
The emperor is coming.

4291
03:50:31,910 --> 03:50:34,470
We must welcome him in the proper fashion.

4292
03:50:35,410 --> 03:50:35,790
Yes, sir!

4293
03:50:38,830 --> 03:50:40,090
Let us begin.

4294
03:50:40,950 --> 03:50:44,530
This will be a feast fit for royalty.

4295
03:50:49,790 --> 03:50:59,890
After eliminating Tenet Jiangrong and Luo Yang, Dong Zhuo placed the emperor under his own protection, and positioned his troops outside of the capital in anticipation of the opportunity created by the chaos within.

4296
03:51:00,410 --> 03:51:05,510
He went on to claim the right to rule for himself and march... I like how they put that in exposition.

4297
03:51:11,240 --> 03:51:14,400
The emperor was reduced to a little more... Oh my god!

4298
03:51:14,460 --> 03:51:16,860
He was evil all along?!

4299
03:51:16,860 --> 03:51:18,440
Who would have thought!

4300
03:51:18,500 --> 03:51:21,020
As the evil music played in the background!

4301
03:51:21,780 --> 03:51:25,500
And how he was evil for the last, I don't know, 10 plus years!

4302
03:51:26,080 --> 03:51:28,920
All who opposed him were executed without exception.

4303
03:51:29,800 --> 03:51:37,160
The Dong's followers used their strength and authority to subjugate the peasantry, greedily indulging in their basest desires.

4304
03:51:37,680 --> 03:51:41,920
The streets of Luo Yang echoed with cries of violence, suffering, and death.

4305
03:51:43,720 --> 03:51:45,160
Oh my god!

4306
03:51:45,420 --> 03:51:46,660
Who would have thought!

4307
03:51:47,420 --> 03:51:48,360
This could be it!

4308
03:51:53,000 --> 03:51:55,780
The number of wounded and sick grows each day.

4309
03:51:56,620 --> 03:51:59,980
The majority of local doctors must have already fled.

4310
03:52:02,400 --> 03:52:05,040
Are you going to flee as well?

4311
03:52:05,140 --> 03:52:06,160
Don't say such things.

4312
03:52:06,580 --> 03:52:09,860
If you are to remain in Luo Yang, then I will too.

4313
03:52:09,900 --> 03:52:10,800
What have you done for me?

4314
03:52:11,520 --> 03:52:14,700
Besides, I still haven't cured you yet.

4315
03:52:15,820 --> 03:52:16,180
But...

4316
03:52:16,180 --> 03:52:18,140
You were trying?!

4317
03:52:18,140 --> 03:52:21,040
This is my advice as a man of medicine.

4318
03:52:21,040 --> 03:52:27,860
Lord Wang Yun may have ordered you here, but I think we should leave Luo Yang.

4319
03:52:28,700 --> 03:52:31,760
To stay is to invite death itself.

4320
03:52:33,040 --> 03:52:35,120
Luo Yang has become a battlefield.

4321
03:52:36,460 --> 03:52:39,100
One wrong word could mean the end for you.

4322
03:52:41,800 --> 03:52:42,580
Excuse me.

4323
03:52:43,920 --> 03:52:44,920
Oh, hello, Diao Chan.

4324
03:52:45,120 --> 03:52:49,280
I wish to speak with you about my father, but I see that I am interrupting.

4325
03:52:49,280 --> 03:52:51,120
Ah, I see.

4326
03:52:51,900 --> 03:52:54,220
I have some other matters to attend to anyway.

4327
03:52:54,820 --> 03:52:55,980
Please, take your time.

4328
03:52:57,760 --> 03:52:58,400
Thank you.

4329
03:53:00,180 --> 03:53:01,980
She was like, he was getting too close to you.

4330
03:53:02,020 --> 03:53:02,640
I don't like it.

4331
03:53:04,500 --> 03:53:08,760
He seems to be very troubled about the recent events in Luo Yang.

4332
03:53:10,900 --> 03:53:18,120
Lord Dong Zhuo's men have rampaged through the city, and I hear he has been equally disruptive in the imperial court.

4333
03:53:20,040 --> 03:53:23,820
I am certain my father feels responsible for this.

4334
03:53:24,520 --> 03:53:29,380
In order to deal with the ten attendants, he unleashed an even greater threat.

4335
03:53:30,580 --> 03:53:32,220
He blames himself for that.

4336
03:53:32,220 --> 03:53:33,840
I mean, he literally left a vacuum.

4337
03:53:34,440 --> 03:53:35,620
Like, what?

4338
03:53:35,900 --> 03:53:41,320
He had no like, plan B after like, step two of this plan.

4339
03:53:41,740 --> 03:53:45,680
It's literally, kill the bureaucrats, and then like, we'll see what happens.

4340
03:53:46,440 --> 03:53:49,640
Let's find a way together, Yao Chen.

4341
03:53:49,860 --> 03:53:52,120
Before you get married like, three more times.

4342
03:54:02,220 --> 03:54:02,740
Women?

4343
03:54:03,120 --> 03:54:04,080
Oh my, Yao Ye.

4344
03:54:04,800 --> 03:54:10,580
I didn't know it at the time, but I think I came here hoping to hear those exact words.

4345
03:54:21,970 --> 03:54:26,510
I've been talking to a lot of women for this part of the game.

4346
03:54:27,710 --> 03:54:29,150
Yeah, that's what I said.

4347
03:54:31,990 --> 03:54:32,950
But I don't care.

4348
03:54:33,050 --> 03:54:35,670
I literally thrive off of this.

4349
03:54:36,110 --> 03:54:37,270
Like, that's my job.

4350
03:54:37,990 --> 03:54:39,530
As long as there's always war, I'll get paid.

4351
03:54:41,390 --> 03:54:41,870
Okay...

4352
03:54:59,630 --> 03:55:00,110
Oh...

4353
03:55:00,110 --> 03:55:03,530
This is where I choose the...

4354
03:55:05,110 --> 03:55:06,230
This is where I choose a faction.

4355
03:55:09,530 --> 03:55:10,530
Superchat, thank you, thank you.

4356
03:55:10,610 --> 03:55:12,550
I can't believe the Dong was a tyrant.

4357
03:55:12,870 --> 03:55:15,090
He has such a trustworthy looking design.

4358
03:55:15,230 --> 03:55:15,830
I know, right?

4359
03:55:20,470 --> 03:55:23,570
I'm gonna choose the most worthless one, because they have the hottest characters.

4360
03:55:27,530 --> 03:55:31,250
Guys, we all know Shu is actually pretty much worthless as a faction.

4361
03:55:34,170 --> 03:55:34,610
Real.

4362
03:55:40,930 --> 03:55:42,910
Alright, observation report.

4363
03:55:55,850 --> 03:55:56,450
Okay,

4364
03:55:59,950 --> 03:56:02,310
it's very fucking weird that you're watching me sleep.

4365
03:56:09,530 --> 03:56:15,970
It's possible that some of your memories are returning to you in those dreams, but it's best to avoid forcing them out.

4366
03:56:16,470 --> 03:56:21,210
Digging too deeply into the past while firmly establishing your present self is a dangerous endeavor.

4367
03:56:22,930 --> 03:56:25,030
Okay, thank you, my doctor.

4368
03:56:25,530 --> 03:56:27,170
Not Doki, I'm Yun Shao.

4369
03:56:27,270 --> 03:56:28,790
I offer you the great honor of...

4370
03:56:28,790 --> 03:56:30,490
Oh my god, what a fucking honor.

4371
03:56:30,870 --> 03:56:32,970
The head of renowned houses of Yun.

4372
03:56:33,270 --> 03:56:39,630
Face to face, a mere soldier like yourself may feel unworthy of my presence, but you need not...

4373
03:56:39,630 --> 03:56:41,870
Oh my god, I so relate with Yun Shao.

4374
03:56:43,270 --> 03:56:43,870
Dragoons!

4375
03:56:44,110 --> 03:56:46,970
I am gracing you with my presence!

4376
03:56:47,390 --> 03:56:53,310
No need to cry, but you need not trouble yourself with such misgivings.

4377
03:56:53,650 --> 03:56:55,070
I simply wish to speak with you.

4378
03:56:55,390 --> 03:56:57,150
Come with an unburdened heart.

4379
03:56:58,550 --> 03:56:59,670
No super chats today.

4380
03:57:00,550 --> 03:57:01,070
Unlucky.

4381
03:57:03,970 --> 03:57:05,770
She's so god.

4382
03:57:06,190 --> 03:57:09,210
Oh my god, we're not worthy.

4383
03:57:13,590 --> 03:57:14,970
Oh my god, him?

4384
03:57:15,270 --> 03:57:16,690
Does he work for Cao Cao?

4385
03:57:21,170 --> 03:57:24,850
Is that the same guy I'm thinking of?

4386
03:57:24,950 --> 03:57:27,590
That works for Cao Cao and Sima Yi?

4387
03:57:28,630 --> 03:57:29,410
And you are?

4388
03:57:29,990 --> 03:57:31,310
The hook guy, yeah.

4389
03:57:31,310 --> 03:57:32,990
Yeah, Jia Xu.

4390
03:57:40,530 --> 03:57:42,250
Aren't you busy right now?

4391
03:57:43,190 --> 03:57:44,830
That seems... Aren't you busy right now?

4392
03:57:54,570 --> 03:57:57,570
I don't know, you're pretty suspicious right now.

4393
03:57:58,510 --> 03:57:59,750
Yeah, he's the...

4394
03:57:59,750 --> 03:58:01,190
Yeah, he...

4395
03:58:01,750 --> 03:58:04,150
He works for a lot of bad people.

4396
03:58:10,930 --> 03:58:13,170
You literally have a Jafar beard.

4397
03:58:13,290 --> 03:58:15,070
Like, I can't trust you at all.

4398
03:58:15,870 --> 03:58:18,150
Like, you have the beard of evil.

4399
03:58:18,150 --> 03:58:18,890
Oh.

4400
03:58:33,260 --> 03:58:35,120
Are we gonna bond?

4401
03:58:43,890 --> 03:58:45,190
I like him.

4402
03:58:45,270 --> 03:58:47,150
How long till he backstabs you?

4403
03:58:48,790 --> 03:58:50,430
What is it?

4404
03:58:53,530 --> 03:58:54,710
I so foolish.

4405
03:59:01,050 --> 03:59:04,770
You never give me a choice, so I might as well say yes cause there's no other choice.

4406
03:59:10,170 --> 03:59:10,610
Wow!

4407
03:59:11,470 --> 03:59:13,690
Oh my gosh, she has so much riz.

4408
03:59:22,810 --> 03:59:23,690
Just walk!

4409
03:59:23,750 --> 03:59:24,390
There's a pathway!

4410
03:59:30,190 --> 03:59:30,810
Wow!

4411
03:59:36,270 --> 03:59:37,550
Hey guys!

4412
03:59:37,970 --> 03:59:39,390
Look at my choices!

4413
03:59:41,450 --> 03:59:47,790
She's like, wow, you're really gonna say yes without me telling you what my choice... What it is?

4414
03:59:48,010 --> 03:59:49,030
And I'm just like, yeah.

4415
03:59:50,270 --> 03:59:52,770
What other choice do I have?

4416
03:59:54,750 --> 03:59:55,950
Just... Sure.

4417
04:00:01,450 --> 04:00:03,290
I can't thank you enough.

4418
04:00:03,770 --> 04:00:06,570
Alright, let's get going, shall we?

4419
04:00:10,050 --> 04:00:11,470
Fade to black.

4420
04:00:15,190 --> 04:00:16,390
Oh my god!

4421
04:00:16,450 --> 04:00:18,190
It unfaded to black?

4422
04:00:18,610 --> 04:00:19,810
What is this?

4423
04:00:20,050 --> 04:00:21,470
Just cause she's a woman?

4424
04:00:23,330 --> 04:00:27,390
The very first time it unfaded to black!

4425
04:00:27,770 --> 04:00:28,810
From black!

4426
04:00:32,720 --> 04:00:33,680
Oh my god!

4427
04:00:33,680 --> 04:00:35,580
We actually have a date cutscene!

4428
04:00:36,800 --> 04:00:39,620
She laughed at my...

4429
04:00:39,620 --> 04:00:42,360
What I said, but I said nothing funny.

4430
04:00:42,740 --> 04:00:43,920
I'm so in.

4431
04:00:56,360 --> 04:00:57,960
Literally look at my face.

4432
04:00:58,040 --> 04:00:59,800
I knew I wasn't saying anything funny.

4433
04:00:59,920 --> 04:01:01,820
Oh my god and the smile.

4434
04:01:02,360 --> 04:01:02,820
Whoa!

4435
04:01:03,420 --> 04:01:06,160
An expression that's not dead inside?

4436
04:01:06,820 --> 04:01:09,660
Oh my... I'm not disassociated as fuck?

4437
04:01:11,380 --> 04:01:15,420
A reaction?

4438
04:01:31,280 --> 04:01:32,780
What's this thing?

4439
04:01:34,200 --> 04:01:35,460
You guessed it.

4440
04:01:35,460 --> 04:01:36,000
Hahaha!

4441
04:01:40,080 --> 04:01:40,700
You...

4442
04:01:40,700 --> 04:01:42,140
This can't be your first date.

4443
04:01:45,420 --> 04:01:48,320
You literally, like, marry three different people.

4444
04:01:51,980 --> 04:01:53,360
Sorry, I accidentally skipped that part.

4445
04:01:55,940 --> 04:01:57,300
Oh my god!

4446
04:02:05,460 --> 04:02:05,760
Oh my god.

4447
04:02:06,560 --> 04:02:08,420
And then she picked Lu Bu over me.

4448
04:02:10,860 --> 04:02:11,380
Like...

4449
04:02:11,380 --> 04:02:12,400
It's not fair.

4450
04:02:12,780 --> 04:02:14,200
She picked Lu Bu in the end.

4451
04:02:18,520 --> 04:02:19,040
Okay.

4452
04:02:20,280 --> 04:02:22,440
I guess let me just talk to the Dong right after.

4453
04:02:25,360 --> 04:02:26,400
Right after...

4454
04:02:26,400 --> 04:02:28,260
Well, it's Lu Bu, Doki.

4455
04:02:28,460 --> 04:02:32,660
You, anyone, would pick Lu Bu in the end.

4456
04:02:32,660 --> 04:02:34,920
Okay, that might be true.

4457
04:02:35,500 --> 04:02:36,820
That, uh...

4458
04:02:36,820 --> 04:02:37,340
Hahaha!

4459
04:02:40,840 --> 04:02:42,680
That might be true.

4460
04:02:46,760 --> 04:02:48,040
Okay, uh...

4461
04:02:48,040 --> 04:02:50,040
Alright, let's talk to the Dong right after.

4462
04:02:50,840 --> 04:02:53,420
That lovely moment we had with Diao Chan.

4463
04:03:02,660 --> 04:03:05,480
I'd like to recognize your achievements yet again.

4464
04:03:07,060 --> 04:03:09,760
So, have you seen the state of the capital?

4465
04:03:11,000 --> 04:03:13,060
No one can deny it at this point.

4466
04:03:13,800 --> 04:03:16,520
The Han dynasty is rotting from the inside.

4467
04:03:18,240 --> 04:03:21,400
Oh yeah, talk more politics to me.

4468
04:03:26,460 --> 04:03:28,140
Utilize your authority.

4469
04:03:28,320 --> 04:03:29,400
Make a preemptive strike.

4470
04:03:29,440 --> 04:03:30,280
What would he like?

4471
04:03:34,510 --> 04:03:35,550
What would he like, guys?

4472
04:03:36,370 --> 04:03:41,870
Guys, if I had to successfully woo the Dong, what would he want me to say?

4473
04:03:41,990 --> 04:03:42,990
Utilize your authority?

4474
04:03:49,150 --> 04:03:49,670
Or...

4475
04:03:49,670 --> 04:03:56,210
You're right, he likes authority.

4476
04:04:04,510 --> 04:04:08,350
Will my actions lead to a world thriving on war?

4477
04:04:08,970 --> 04:04:11,310
Or one of chaos ruled by death?

4478
04:04:12,450 --> 04:04:14,170
It's difficult to say.

4479
04:04:15,190 --> 04:04:21,710
If something isn't done, however, the rot is sure to steadily spread.

4480
04:04:22,790 --> 04:04:25,010
I refuse to accept that.

4481
04:04:25,590 --> 04:04:30,230
What's more, I've obtained the power necessary to change that.

4482
04:04:30,930 --> 04:04:32,830
So, how about it?

4483
04:04:32,830 --> 04:04:35,330
Would you be interested in serving me?

4484
04:04:38,370 --> 04:04:39,530
No.

4485
04:04:40,050 --> 04:04:41,430
And no.

4486
04:04:42,610 --> 04:04:43,190
No!

4487
04:04:43,830 --> 04:04:45,990
My Dong route!

4488
04:04:48,550 --> 04:04:49,650
No!

4489
04:04:52,390 --> 04:04:54,430
I don't wanna... No!

4490
04:04:55,570 --> 04:04:58,050
I wanna keep all options open!

4491
04:04:58,050 --> 04:04:58,530
Get in!

4492
04:05:00,810 --> 04:05:05,650
No, we can't serve no Dong for us, guys!

4493
04:05:06,150 --> 04:05:08,690
The Dong route has been denied!

4494
04:05:09,890 --> 04:05:11,150
I'll find my own path.

4495
04:05:12,330 --> 04:05:12,690
Woah!

4496
04:05:14,510 --> 04:05:16,150
Woah, I'm dying!

4497
04:05:28,050 --> 04:05:32,140
Submitting to no one, and making the presence of the storm known.

4498
04:05:33,650 --> 04:05:37,010
That wind carries with it the life I desire.

4499
04:05:39,370 --> 04:05:41,030
It has been a true pleasure.

4500
04:05:41,990 --> 04:05:46,030
Go now, move through the land under your own freedom.

4501
04:05:46,150 --> 04:05:49,370
The Dong route is dead, but he's not giving up.

4502
04:05:51,770 --> 04:05:55,370
Oh, my bond with the Dong has grown stronger!

4503
04:05:55,370 --> 04:05:57,390
What the fuck happened?

4504
04:05:59,210 --> 04:06:01,550
How did it grow stronger?

4505
04:06:02,430 --> 04:06:03,070
Alright.

4506
04:06:05,250 --> 04:06:08,810
I need to defeat foes with YYY.

4507
04:06:09,170 --> 04:06:10,610
Okay, I just have to do YYY.

4508
04:06:10,850 --> 04:06:11,070
Okay.

4509
04:06:12,490 --> 04:06:13,050
Who are you?

4510
04:06:15,890 --> 04:06:18,470
I'm playing hard to get and he likes that.

4511
04:06:18,470 --> 04:06:18,910
Hahaha!

4512
04:06:25,070 --> 04:06:25,430
Hello?

4513
04:06:27,450 --> 04:06:29,210
Oh, it's another like Chao Chao.

4514
04:06:32,530 --> 04:06:33,650
He's so generic.

4515
04:06:39,170 --> 04:06:39,270
Heh.

4516
04:06:42,810 --> 04:06:43,770
Yeah, I hope so too, guys.

4517
04:06:43,830 --> 04:06:44,630
Thank you for the superchat.

4518
04:06:44,710 --> 04:06:45,490
Thank you, thank you.

4519
04:06:45,550 --> 04:06:47,630
I genuinely hope they make DLC with more factions to join.

4520
04:06:47,630 --> 04:06:48,950
Oh, they do that too.

4521
04:06:50,590 --> 04:06:52,990
I have the proper documentation if you'd like to see.

4522
04:07:06,440 --> 04:07:07,760
That was crazy.

4523
04:07:08,540 --> 04:07:10,320
That was such a crazy statement.

4524
04:07:11,100 --> 04:07:11,900
Holy fuck.

4525
04:07:12,620 --> 04:07:15,340
And then my fucking bond grows stronger.

4526
04:07:31,880 --> 04:07:33,460
Sasha passed or hasn't.

4527
04:07:33,480 --> 04:07:34,300
Thank you for the superchat.

4528
04:07:34,380 --> 04:07:35,180
Thank you, thank you.

4529
04:07:43,900 --> 04:07:46,000
It's definitely been a really good game though.

4530
04:07:46,520 --> 04:07:48,100
I've been enjoying it a lot.

4531
04:07:54,740 --> 04:07:57,940
I'm pretty sure I'm still like just in the beginning of this game.

4532
04:07:58,020 --> 04:07:58,760
That's crazy.

4533
04:08:01,240 --> 04:08:02,600
I'm still at the beginning.

4534
04:08:36,810 --> 04:08:38,710
Use me?

4535
04:08:44,950 --> 04:08:48,350
Um, I am a person and not a toy.

4536
04:08:57,440 --> 04:08:58,840
Alright.

4537
04:09:01,340 --> 04:09:01,740
Alright.

4538
04:09:03,180 --> 04:09:05,460
Okay, that goes for the next stage.

4539
04:09:05,580 --> 04:09:05,980
Scissors.

4540
04:09:06,380 --> 04:09:07,260
Okay, Yuan Shao.

4541
04:09:07,800 --> 04:09:08,140
Hello.

4542
04:09:08,580 --> 04:09:12,400
If I'm gonna increase my bond with anyone, I'm gonna increase my bond with the rich guy.

4543
04:09:13,400 --> 04:09:14,880
I am not a gold digger, guys.

4544
04:09:15,140 --> 04:09:15,740
I'm just saying.

4545
04:09:15,840 --> 04:09:17,540
You gotta have friends in powerful places.

4546
04:09:17,540 --> 04:09:18,040
What is this?

4547
04:09:29,510 --> 04:09:30,870
That's me.

4548
04:09:31,770 --> 04:09:37,930
Bro, am I like... Bro, I feel like every fucking general has been like...

4549
04:09:37,930 --> 04:09:39,250
They're...

4550
04:09:40,510 --> 04:09:42,630
They all want me.

4551
04:09:46,920 --> 04:09:48,260
You heard about that?

4552
04:09:53,100 --> 04:09:54,220
Nexie, thank you for the super chat.

4553
04:09:54,360 --> 04:09:54,920
Thank you, thank you.

4554
04:09:55,020 --> 04:09:56,320
Doki is not a toy.

4555
04:09:56,460 --> 04:09:58,180
Go buy a Doki Brain plushie now!

4556
04:09:58,440 --> 04:09:59,280
Thank you for the super chat.

4557
04:09:59,400 --> 04:10:00,140
Thank you, thank you.

4558
04:10:23,960 --> 04:10:25,140
I'm sorry.

4559
04:10:28,460 --> 04:10:30,360
I just went, sorry.

4560
04:10:39,960 --> 04:10:40,700
Excuse me.

4561
04:10:45,860 --> 04:10:47,820
Sorry, I don't know.

4562
04:10:48,880 --> 04:10:49,880
I don't know.

4563
04:10:53,800 --> 04:10:54,860
I cannot.

4564
04:10:56,340 --> 04:10:57,180
Will you join?

4565
04:10:57,640 --> 04:10:59,860
I won't leave Wanyun.

4566
04:11:23,000 --> 04:11:25,540
Why can't I join the gold boys?

4567
04:11:26,220 --> 04:11:29,080
He's literally wearing an armor made of gold.

4568
04:11:29,320 --> 04:11:32,220
The most inefficient metal out there.

4569
04:11:33,680 --> 04:11:35,920
And he has two J's.

4570
04:11:36,720 --> 04:11:38,100
J doesn't even protection.

4571
04:11:38,820 --> 04:11:39,900
It's just fancy.

4572
04:11:43,780 --> 04:11:45,640
It's not even protection.

4573
04:11:48,120 --> 04:11:50,380
Okay, conquer bases five times.

4574
04:11:50,520 --> 04:11:50,760
Okay.

4575
04:11:52,820 --> 04:11:55,700
Alright, we gotta do a mission.

4576
04:11:58,640 --> 04:12:03,060
Alright, my father's enemies must be eliminated and I'll ask your help in seeing it through.

4577
04:12:03,680 --> 04:12:06,320
Prevention of Wanyun's assassination?

4578
04:12:06,780 --> 04:12:08,400
Where is he gonna get assassinated?

4579
04:12:08,500 --> 04:12:11,680
Alright, we're gonna make sure you don't die again.

4580
04:12:18,320 --> 04:12:20,320
Alright, Wanyun.

4581
04:12:22,180 --> 04:12:23,900
We gotta make sure you live.

4582
04:12:25,160 --> 04:12:25,720
Okay.

4583
04:12:27,200 --> 04:12:28,200
Nice, okay.

4584
04:12:28,800 --> 04:12:30,800
Jesus Christ, I feel so weak.

4585
04:12:31,620 --> 04:12:35,960
But actually, since I need to I just need to use Y all the time.

4586
04:12:36,720 --> 04:12:39,540
Jesus Christ, the Y takes fucking forever though.

4587
04:12:41,680 --> 04:12:44,420
The Y attack actually takes so long.

4588
04:12:46,440 --> 04:12:47,580
Alright, you know what?

4589
04:12:47,740 --> 04:12:48,300
Fuck this.

4590
04:12:49,280 --> 04:12:56,020
I'll use the- I'll complete it in the- in the fucking regular fights.

4591
04:12:56,120 --> 04:12:57,440
These assassins are way too strong.

4592
04:12:58,040 --> 04:13:02,300
They're way too tanky to do any fancy fucking shit for Gwanyun.

4593
04:13:04,320 --> 04:13:04,960
Nice.

4594
04:13:05,100 --> 04:13:06,020
That's fucking right.

4595
04:13:06,160 --> 04:13:10,160
You thought you could- You thought you could fucking do that to me?

4596
04:13:10,480 --> 04:13:11,760
That's fucking right.

4597
04:13:12,640 --> 04:13:12,980
Get parried.

4598
04:13:14,040 --> 04:13:15,020
Get fucking parried.

4599
04:13:16,920 --> 04:13:17,560
Nice.

4600
04:13:18,500 --> 04:13:19,460
Bye, one guy.

4601
04:13:22,620 --> 04:13:23,180
Okay.

4602
04:13:25,220 --> 04:13:26,280
Jesus Christ.

4603
04:13:27,300 --> 04:13:29,500
Fucking forever to die!

4604
04:13:33,180 --> 04:13:34,920
Come on, get you out of here.

4605
04:13:34,980 --> 04:13:36,660
And there's like three guys too.

4606
04:13:36,920 --> 04:13:37,920
I don't know.

4607
04:13:38,040 --> 04:13:39,660
I don't know if I'm under-leveled or not.

4608
04:13:40,060 --> 04:13:47,200
I feel like I'm not because the main general story missions like the main story missions are not that hard.

4609
04:13:48,380 --> 04:13:49,740
They're just super tanky.

4610
04:13:52,220 --> 04:13:53,580
Yeah, I don't think so.

4611
04:13:53,640 --> 04:13:55,200
I'm just- They're just really tanky.

4612
04:13:56,780 --> 04:14:01,220
But they're like- Yeah, they're like bullet sponges, but like, not bullets.

4613
04:14:01,620 --> 04:14:02,040
Hahaha.

4614
04:14:04,400 --> 04:14:06,980
They're like- They're like spear sponges.

4615
04:14:07,820 --> 04:14:09,820
Okay, we prevented the assassination.

4616
04:14:11,620 --> 04:14:13,760
Perfect evade training.

4617
04:14:14,080 --> 04:14:18,260
Okay, we need to do this to defeat 100 enemies.

4618
04:14:24,630 --> 04:14:26,050
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

4619
04:14:26,370 --> 04:14:28,290
Oh wait, let me talk to you here.

4620
04:14:28,690 --> 04:14:29,510
I'm most grateful.

4621
04:14:30,230 --> 04:14:31,810
They sent assassins too, did they?

4622
04:14:32,250 --> 04:14:33,790
I'm pleased you were able to deal with them.

4623
04:14:34,110 --> 04:14:35,250
Thank you for the super chat!

4624
04:14:35,350 --> 04:14:36,170
Thank you, thank you!

4625
04:14:36,430 --> 04:14:39,690
Thanks to you, I was able to focus on fighting the enemy before me.

4626
04:14:40,090 --> 04:14:40,710
Very nice.

4627
04:14:41,130 --> 04:14:41,890
I am a sword.

4628
04:14:42,170 --> 04:14:45,390
My mission is to cut through the darkness and bring the dawn's light to the world.

4629
04:14:46,430 --> 04:14:49,390
Until I met you, I believe that I must fight through the darkness.

4630
04:14:49,610 --> 04:14:51,230
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah.

4631
04:14:51,810 --> 04:14:53,310
Woah, woah, woah!

4632
04:14:54,990 --> 04:14:56,810
Woah, woah, woah, woah.

4633
04:14:57,130 --> 04:14:59,890
Okay, Diao Chan, you gotta get in a line.

4634
04:15:01,410 --> 04:15:04,150
Oh, Diao Chan, I'm sorry.

4635
04:15:04,250 --> 04:15:06,150
There's a huge line.

4636
04:15:07,990 --> 04:15:09,410
Woah, woah, woah.

4637
04:15:13,310 --> 04:15:14,250
Oh my god.

4638
04:15:14,350 --> 04:15:15,970
What do you mean my wrist is too strong?

4639
04:15:16,010 --> 04:15:17,290
I'm doing nothing!

4640
04:15:17,290 --> 04:15:18,270
Like...

4641
04:15:20,990 --> 04:15:23,490
Like, I'm not doing anything!

4642
04:15:23,830 --> 04:15:24,610
They just...

4643
04:15:24,610 --> 04:15:26,330
They just come to me!

4644
04:15:32,390 --> 04:15:33,910
I'm nearly doing nothing.

4645
04:15:34,190 --> 04:15:35,130
They all just keep...

4646
04:15:35,130 --> 04:15:36,190
They all just arrive.

4647
04:15:37,190 --> 04:15:38,250
It's actually crazy.

4648
04:15:43,860 --> 04:15:46,240
It's actually crazy how I don't have to do anything.

4649
04:15:49,420 --> 04:15:50,880
Okay, let's get him out of the way.

4650
04:15:54,080 --> 04:15:54,480
Nice.

4651
04:15:55,560 --> 04:15:55,960
Goodbye.

4652
04:16:03,200 --> 04:16:07,220
Alright, I wanna... Okay, let me attack these guys so I can do this.

4653
04:16:10,160 --> 04:16:10,660
There you go.

4654
04:16:11,180 --> 04:16:11,520
There you go.

4655
04:16:11,520 --> 04:16:12,540
That should be...

4656
04:16:12,540 --> 04:16:13,640
something, right?

4657
04:16:14,020 --> 04:16:15,800
That should have given me like ten.

4658
04:16:17,280 --> 04:16:19,420
The peasant is facing a desperate fight.

4659
04:16:19,600 --> 04:16:21,620
Is this not a peasant?

4660
04:16:22,540 --> 04:16:23,060
Right now?

4661
04:16:27,480 --> 04:16:29,580
Is this not a peasant right now?

4662
04:16:32,480 --> 04:16:34,600
Do not allow the peasants to be defeated?

4663
04:16:34,760 --> 04:16:36,320
I'm fighting one of them right now!

4664
04:16:38,300 --> 04:16:39,740
There's only one of me!

4665
04:16:43,780 --> 04:16:44,460
Oh my god.

4666
04:16:44,520 --> 04:16:45,220
Okay, here we go.

4667
04:16:46,320 --> 04:16:47,160
Alright, I'm heading over.

4668
04:16:47,300 --> 04:16:47,740
I'm heading over.

4669
04:16:47,880 --> 04:16:49,040
I'm heading... Oh, I went the wrong way.

4670
04:16:49,080 --> 04:16:49,580
I'm heading over.

4671
04:16:50,780 --> 04:16:52,880
I'm going as fast as I went the wrong way.

4672
04:16:52,980 --> 04:16:54,420
I'm going as fast as I can.

4673
04:16:55,580 --> 04:16:55,940
Sorry.

4674
04:16:56,260 --> 04:16:57,460
Oh, I've... Oh, sorry.

4675
04:16:57,620 --> 04:16:59,800
Okay, maybe some peasants might die.

4676
04:17:00,920 --> 04:17:01,920
But that's okay.

4677
04:17:02,960 --> 04:17:03,680
Okay, okay.

4678
04:17:03,720 --> 04:17:04,180
Don't worry.

4679
04:17:04,240 --> 04:17:04,560
I'm here.

4680
04:17:04,600 --> 04:17:04,880
I'm here.

4681
04:17:04,920 --> 04:17:05,180
I'm here.

4682
04:17:05,320 --> 04:17:07,380
Oh, this peasant is so fucking dead.

4683
04:17:07,380 --> 04:17:08,280
Oh my god.

4684
04:17:11,720 --> 04:17:14,060
I think the other... I think I might fail this one.

4685
04:17:14,140 --> 04:17:14,680
Not gonna lie.

4686
04:17:17,420 --> 04:17:18,340
Oh my god.

4687
04:17:18,380 --> 04:17:19,840
Wait, they actually might die.

4688
04:17:24,080 --> 04:17:24,700
Okay, nice.

4689
04:17:24,760 --> 04:17:25,200
I broke it.

4690
04:17:26,860 --> 04:17:28,940
Okay, because they're so tanky, I...

4691
04:17:28,940 --> 04:17:29,900
I don't know.

4692
04:17:31,040 --> 04:17:32,700
It's not looking so good for him.

4693
04:17:35,860 --> 04:17:37,120
Because I'm still...

4694
04:17:37,120 --> 04:17:38,920
I'm still halfway across here.

4695
04:17:41,360 --> 04:17:43,760
It's like I parried this, but I'm not parrying it.

4696
04:17:46,160 --> 04:17:47,260
Oh my god, please.

4697
04:17:47,880 --> 04:17:49,200
Peasants, please live.

4698
04:17:49,720 --> 04:17:51,660
I really need you to live right now.

4699
04:17:51,880 --> 04:17:54,520
I'm still trying to kill this one guy.

4700
04:17:56,920 --> 04:17:57,500
Oh, damn.

4701
04:17:59,140 --> 04:17:59,960
So close.

4702
04:18:00,460 --> 04:18:00,840
Come on.

4703
04:18:01,080 --> 04:18:01,500
Just live.

4704
04:18:02,480 --> 04:18:03,260
Oh my god.

4705
04:18:04,460 --> 04:18:04,860
Okay.

4706
04:18:12,340 --> 04:18:13,140
Come on.

4707
04:18:13,720 --> 04:18:14,520
You can live.

4708
04:18:14,660 --> 04:18:15,240
I'm heading there.

4709
04:18:15,340 --> 04:18:17,420
I swear to god if you... Oh, I went the wrong way.

4710
04:18:19,400 --> 04:18:19,800
Please.

4711
04:18:20,420 --> 04:18:20,720
Please.

4712
04:18:21,420 --> 04:18:21,820
Please.

4713
04:18:23,680 --> 04:18:24,540
I'm heading there.

4714
04:18:24,620 --> 04:18:25,280
Oh my god.

4715
04:18:25,320 --> 04:18:26,200
You just... I got it.

4716
04:18:26,240 --> 04:18:26,680
I just made it.

4717
04:18:26,720 --> 04:18:27,180
I just made it.

4718
04:18:27,200 --> 04:18:27,840
I just made it.

4719
04:18:28,380 --> 04:18:29,120
Don't worry.

4720
04:18:29,120 --> 04:18:29,520
Don't worry.

4721
04:18:30,900 --> 04:18:31,380
Don't worry.

4722
04:18:31,500 --> 04:18:32,480
I did it.

4723
04:18:32,480 --> 04:18:33,540
I'm a hero.

4724
04:18:35,460 --> 04:18:36,300
There you go.

4725
04:18:36,780 --> 04:18:37,300
Get him.

4726
04:18:37,880 --> 04:18:38,440
Get him.

4727
04:18:42,170 --> 04:18:42,550
There we go.

4728
04:18:42,590 --> 04:18:43,030
We did it.

4729
04:18:44,830 --> 04:18:45,950
Oh my god.

4730
04:18:45,970 --> 04:18:49,890
He just sat there while I was fucking fighting for my life for him.

4731
04:18:51,650 --> 04:18:52,650
I'm a hero.

4732
04:18:55,310 --> 04:18:55,870
It's okay.

4733
04:18:57,610 --> 04:18:59,450
Allows LBLY to evade.

4734
04:18:59,450 --> 04:19:00,170
Okay, nice.

4735
04:19:01,470 --> 04:19:03,070
The fact that he just stood there.

4736
04:19:03,190 --> 04:19:04,510
Just taking it.

4737
04:19:05,190 --> 04:19:06,310
I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?

4738
04:19:06,630 --> 04:19:07,170
Get up.

4739
04:19:12,010 --> 04:19:12,530
41.

4740
04:19:15,690 --> 04:19:16,730
Okay, 41.

4741
04:19:17,130 --> 04:19:18,390
Did I do anything with the YY?

4742
04:19:18,450 --> 04:19:19,270
8 people.

4743
04:19:20,370 --> 04:19:21,790
We're almost there.

4744
04:19:21,930 --> 04:19:23,510
We killed 8 people.

4745
04:19:26,410 --> 04:19:26,930
Nice.

4746
04:19:26,930 --> 04:19:28,930
Okay, we gotta get those like the...

4747
04:19:30,290 --> 04:19:32,750
Okay, we're gonna try and...

4748
04:19:32,750 --> 04:19:33,790
We're gonna try and do these.

4749
04:19:34,030 --> 04:19:37,670
I wanna at least get progress the Guan Yun route.

4750
04:19:38,610 --> 04:19:40,190
That's my only goal today.

4751
04:19:41,770 --> 04:19:44,810
That's my end goal for today's stream.

4752
04:19:45,510 --> 04:19:47,450
Shit, I keep accidentally jumping off.

4753
04:19:48,490 --> 04:19:53,030
My end goal stream is to progress the Guan Yun route.

4754
04:19:57,950 --> 04:19:58,430
Okay.

4755
04:19:59,390 --> 04:20:00,890
Come on, let me do this.

4756
04:20:01,230 --> 04:20:01,770
There we go.

4757
04:20:02,770 --> 04:20:03,710
That should be good.

4758
04:20:06,150 --> 04:20:06,630
Nice.

4759
04:20:09,950 --> 04:20:10,730
Alright, good.

4760
04:20:11,290 --> 04:20:12,390
Oh, I forgot to lock in.

4761
04:20:15,970 --> 04:20:16,450
Nice.

4762
04:20:16,590 --> 04:20:16,950
Goodbye.

4763
04:20:20,390 --> 04:20:21,930
Okay, we gotta kill the thief too.

4764
04:20:25,490 --> 04:20:26,770
Oh, what the fuck?

4765
04:20:27,270 --> 04:20:28,370
Get out of here!

4766
04:20:29,030 --> 04:20:30,470
I'm locking in.

4767
04:20:31,030 --> 04:20:32,050
This is important.

4768
04:20:33,550 --> 04:20:35,010
Oh, I get like...

4769
04:20:35,010 --> 04:20:38,410
I get like more stuff if I kill the thieves.

4770
04:20:40,530 --> 04:20:42,170
That's fucking right.

4771
04:20:43,070 --> 04:20:43,590
Okay.

4772
04:20:46,350 --> 04:20:48,270
Oh shit.

4773
04:20:49,710 --> 04:20:50,430
Okay.

4774
04:20:50,570 --> 04:20:51,630
And then we'll use that.

4775
04:20:52,770 --> 04:20:53,490
Okay.

4776
04:20:54,970 --> 04:20:57,330
Oh, I have to kill a hundred with this.

4777
04:20:57,710 --> 04:20:58,890
That's the worst part.

4778
04:21:01,890 --> 04:21:02,850
Come on.

4779
04:21:04,170 --> 04:21:05,730
That's fucking right, get out of here!

4780
04:21:09,870 --> 04:21:10,590
Alright.

4781
04:21:11,110 --> 04:21:11,850
Next one.

4782
04:21:12,870 --> 04:21:14,210
Not him yet.

4783
04:21:15,090 --> 04:21:17,450
I'll use this to start it off though.

4784
04:21:18,010 --> 04:21:18,670
The YYY.

4785
04:21:20,410 --> 04:21:21,990
Oh, you broke my combo!

4786
04:21:22,850 --> 04:21:23,450
No!

4787
04:21:25,810 --> 04:21:26,970
My combo!

4788
04:21:29,190 --> 04:21:30,530
You fuckers!

4789
04:21:30,650 --> 04:21:31,790
Stop breaking my combo!

4790
04:21:31,990 --> 04:21:32,850
I'm trying to...

4791
04:21:32,850 --> 04:21:35,550
I'm trying to progress my relationship with Guanyin!

4792
04:21:38,790 --> 04:21:40,590
This is fucked.

4793
04:21:42,090 --> 04:21:44,570
He's ruining this for all of us.

4794
04:21:46,750 --> 04:21:48,330
It has to be the left side.

4795
04:21:48,390 --> 04:21:48,950
I'm pretty sure.

4796
04:21:49,590 --> 04:21:50,270
Oh, I found him.

4797
04:21:50,430 --> 04:21:50,790
Nevermind.

4798
04:21:55,090 --> 04:21:55,450
Nice.

4799
04:21:56,730 --> 04:21:57,170
There we go.

4800
04:21:57,630 --> 04:21:58,030
Oh my god!

4801
04:21:58,090 --> 04:21:58,570
I did one of them!

4802
04:21:58,850 --> 04:21:59,190
Nice!

4803
04:22:01,410 --> 04:22:02,070
Oh my god!

4804
04:22:03,730 --> 04:22:04,090
Nice!

4805
04:22:07,830 --> 04:22:08,690
Where am I going?

4806
04:22:08,870 --> 04:22:09,530
Where am I going?

4807
04:22:13,610 --> 04:22:15,150
Really, where am I going?

4808
04:22:17,370 --> 04:22:17,990
Okay, nice.

4809
04:22:24,450 --> 04:22:24,910
Parry.

4810
04:22:24,990 --> 04:22:26,050
Oh no, I can't even parry right!

4811
04:22:29,190 --> 04:22:30,110
Okay, YYYY.

4812
04:22:31,530 --> 04:22:31,990
Parry.

4813
04:22:32,270 --> 04:22:32,590
No!

4814
04:22:34,290 --> 04:22:35,750
Okay, let me eat the bread first.

4815
04:22:37,150 --> 04:22:37,610
Nice.

4816
04:22:38,310 --> 04:22:39,110
Okay, I got it.

4817
04:22:41,790 --> 04:22:42,250
Nice!

4818
04:22:44,290 --> 04:22:45,890
Use that spear!

4819
04:22:49,290 --> 04:22:50,810
Nice, I got another parry.

4820
04:22:51,150 --> 04:22:51,850
Good.

4821
04:22:52,470 --> 04:22:54,590
Okay, I'm locking in.

4822
04:22:56,650 --> 04:22:58,210
We're so close.

4823
04:23:00,630 --> 04:23:01,590
Come on.

4824
04:23:02,370 --> 04:23:03,470
No, I missed!

4825
04:23:04,730 --> 04:23:05,650
Fuck.

4826
04:23:07,830 --> 04:23:09,190
Come on.

4827
04:23:09,630 --> 04:23:10,630
You're so low!

4828
04:23:10,630 --> 04:23:10,650
No!

4829
04:23:12,470 --> 04:23:13,090
Nice.

4830
04:23:14,360 --> 04:23:16,190
The tables have been turned.

4831
04:23:21,750 --> 04:23:23,710
Okay, one more.

4832
04:23:24,190 --> 04:23:25,150
One more!

4833
04:23:25,630 --> 04:23:27,570
We have one more achievement left.

4834
04:23:31,730 --> 04:23:32,590
Nice.

4835
04:23:34,930 --> 04:23:35,790
24.

4836
04:23:36,190 --> 04:23:37,050
How much do I have left?

4837
04:23:37,530 --> 04:23:40,070
Jesus, this is taking so long.

4838
04:23:40,070 --> 04:23:42,790
Just for Guan Yu to notice me.

4839
04:23:44,450 --> 04:23:45,030
Guan Yu, please.

4840
04:23:45,150 --> 04:23:46,250
Just notice me.

4841
04:23:47,210 --> 04:23:48,070
Just please.

4842
04:23:48,770 --> 04:23:49,970
Just look at me.

4843
04:23:50,110 --> 04:23:51,330
That's all I want.

4844
04:23:51,910 --> 04:23:54,170
I don't like this one.

4845
04:23:55,190 --> 04:23:58,330
Jump backwards and launch able to... Okay, we gotta get that.

4846
04:23:59,090 --> 04:24:03,550
And then, I wanna get rid of the... Replay, perform a powerful performance swooping.

4847
04:24:04,110 --> 04:24:08,330
Sending surrounding enemies... Okay, maybe the severe... The savage thrust is better.

4848
04:24:08,570 --> 04:24:08,890
Yeah.

4849
04:24:09,830 --> 04:24:12,770
I feel like the savage thrust would be a lot better.

4850
04:24:15,730 --> 04:24:16,170
Okay.

4851
04:24:16,830 --> 04:24:18,110
Gotta grab this.

4852
04:24:19,310 --> 04:24:20,570
Gotta grab this.

4853
04:24:20,690 --> 04:24:22,170
Apparently, it's taking a while to grab.

4854
04:24:22,590 --> 04:24:24,050
Alright, we gotta find...

4855
04:24:25,210 --> 04:24:26,970
Gotta find more of those mini areas.

4856
04:24:30,730 --> 04:24:31,470
Hurry it up!

4857
04:24:31,510 --> 04:24:31,970
Oh, nice.

4858
04:24:32,270 --> 04:24:32,670
There we go.

4859
04:24:33,290 --> 04:24:33,950
This should be it.

4860
04:24:35,410 --> 04:24:38,170
This should lead me to... Okay.

4861
04:24:38,450 --> 04:24:39,070
Defeat the bandit.

4862
04:24:39,090 --> 04:24:40,110
Oh, there's another one of these.

4863
04:24:40,410 --> 04:24:40,850
That's good.

4864
04:24:40,890 --> 04:24:41,250
That's good.

4865
04:24:41,330 --> 04:24:43,310
That gives you more chance to...

4866
04:24:45,370 --> 04:24:47,450
Gives you more chance to fight.

4867
04:24:48,670 --> 04:24:50,350
It'd be funny if I find him right here.

4868
04:24:50,470 --> 04:24:50,890
Okay, no.

4869
04:24:51,030 --> 04:24:51,390
Thank god.

4870
04:24:51,490 --> 04:24:51,670
Okay.

4871
04:24:52,070 --> 04:24:55,390
It'd be like... It'd be funny, but like I really...

4872
04:24:56,510 --> 04:24:58,430
I really need to complete this.

4873
04:25:02,330 --> 04:25:02,710
Okay.

4874
04:25:02,710 --> 04:25:03,090
Okay.

4875
04:25:04,650 --> 04:25:06,490
Gotta build it up.

4876
04:25:08,450 --> 04:25:09,230
Come on.

4877
04:25:09,530 --> 04:25:10,430
Come on!

4878
04:25:10,570 --> 04:25:11,530
I need more!

4879
04:25:11,810 --> 04:25:14,490
I need more XP for this!

4880
04:25:16,650 --> 04:25:17,490
Nice.

4881
04:25:18,630 --> 04:25:19,830
Alright, nice.

4882
04:25:20,910 --> 04:25:23,770
Okay, I need like something for...

4883
04:25:23,770 --> 04:25:26,450
for my...

4884
04:25:26,450 --> 04:25:27,650
x-ray.

4885
04:25:28,430 --> 04:25:29,470
I need more.

4886
04:25:29,470 --> 04:25:29,570
I need more.

4887
04:25:29,890 --> 04:25:33,690
Come on, I need more.

4888
04:25:34,130 --> 04:25:35,030
I need more!

4889
04:25:37,690 --> 04:25:38,210
Nice.

4890
04:25:39,050 --> 04:25:40,250
Oh, serious.

4891
04:25:40,890 --> 04:25:41,910
I should kill somebody.

4892
04:25:42,070 --> 04:25:42,390
Yes!

4893
04:25:43,210 --> 04:25:43,730
Good.

4894
04:25:45,150 --> 04:25:45,610
That's good.

4895
04:25:45,650 --> 04:25:45,930
That's good.

4896
04:25:45,950 --> 04:25:46,310
That's good.

4897
04:25:46,810 --> 04:25:48,330
I just need to charge it again.

4898
04:25:49,610 --> 04:25:50,130
Nice.

4899
04:25:52,010 --> 04:25:53,050
Get over here.

4900
04:25:53,690 --> 04:25:55,190
Okay, that should be a lot.

4901
04:25:55,330 --> 04:25:56,930
That seemed like a lot that I just got.

4902
04:25:58,350 --> 04:25:59,230
God damn it.

4903
04:25:59,310 --> 04:26:00,670
Okay, I'm not gonna kill you yet.

4904
04:26:00,770 --> 04:26:01,070
No!

4905
04:26:01,310 --> 04:26:02,670
That was the only... Okay.

4906
04:26:03,370 --> 04:26:03,850
That sucks.

4907
04:26:07,370 --> 04:26:08,750
My... Give me more RB.

4908
04:26:10,390 --> 04:26:11,170
Oh, shit.

4909
04:26:11,950 --> 04:26:12,370
Nice.

4910
04:26:12,470 --> 04:26:12,670
Okay.

4911
04:26:13,650 --> 04:26:14,910
I should have killed some people, right?

4912
04:26:15,290 --> 04:26:15,670
I don't know.

4913
04:26:17,870 --> 04:26:19,510
Oh, please tell me that's it.

4914
04:26:21,650 --> 04:26:22,130
Okay.

4915
04:26:22,130 --> 04:26:22,610
Nice.

4916
04:26:22,830 --> 04:26:23,150
Parry.

4917
04:26:25,570 --> 04:26:26,290
Please.

4918
04:26:26,930 --> 04:26:27,650
Please.

4919
04:26:27,730 --> 04:26:28,590
It's for Guan Yun.

4920
04:26:28,690 --> 04:26:29,930
You'd understand, right?

4921
04:26:30,730 --> 04:26:31,450
Please.

4922
04:26:32,350 --> 04:26:34,110
It's for Guan Yun!

4923
04:26:36,710 --> 04:26:38,150
Please understand!

4924
04:26:38,510 --> 04:26:39,510
It's for him!

4925
04:26:42,430 --> 04:26:42,830
Okay.

4926
04:26:47,870 --> 04:26:48,730
Okay, no.

4927
04:26:48,810 --> 04:26:49,570
I fucked up the parry.

4928
04:26:53,150 --> 04:26:53,450
Come on.

4929
04:26:54,250 --> 04:26:56,050
No, I missed?!

4930
04:26:56,750 --> 04:26:57,210
Fuck.

4931
04:26:57,810 --> 04:26:58,750
I actually missed.

4932
04:27:05,250 --> 04:27:06,170
Nice.

4933
04:27:06,790 --> 04:27:07,190
Parry.

4934
04:27:10,470 --> 04:27:10,790
Okay.

4935
04:27:12,710 --> 04:27:13,950
Get out of here!

4936
04:27:15,010 --> 04:27:15,930
That's right!

4937
04:27:16,850 --> 04:27:17,550
Get out!

4938
04:27:17,550 --> 04:27:17,690
Get out!

4939
04:27:22,570 --> 04:27:23,970
Alright, where are we at?

4940
04:27:24,770 --> 04:27:25,750
Holy shit.

4941
04:27:25,870 --> 04:27:28,150
This has to be the hardest challenge for Guan Yun.

4942
04:27:29,850 --> 04:27:30,790
For Guan Yun.

4943
04:27:31,270 --> 04:27:32,250
For Guan Yun!

4944
04:27:33,730 --> 04:27:34,650
How much more?

4945
04:27:34,730 --> 04:27:35,750
We're so close!

4946
04:27:36,050 --> 04:27:37,050
We need eight more!

4947
04:27:38,310 --> 04:27:39,210
Do it for him!

4948
04:27:41,770 --> 04:27:42,330
Alright.

4949
04:27:42,510 --> 04:27:42,870
Nice.

4950
04:27:45,030 --> 04:27:45,350
Nice.

4951
04:27:45,350 --> 04:27:45,990
We're almost there.

4952
04:27:50,800 --> 04:27:51,880
Do it for him!

4953
04:27:54,400 --> 04:27:55,300
That should be it.

4954
04:27:55,880 --> 04:27:56,700
That wasn't it.

4955
04:27:56,980 --> 04:27:58,180
That wasn't it!

4956
04:28:01,460 --> 04:28:04,110
Oh my god, we did it!

4957
04:28:04,250 --> 04:28:04,570
Nice.

4958
04:28:04,690 --> 04:28:04,870
Okay.

4959
04:28:05,230 --> 04:28:05,450
Okay.

4960
04:28:05,510 --> 04:28:05,710
Nice.

4961
04:28:05,770 --> 04:28:05,910
Nice.

4962
04:28:05,930 --> 04:28:06,030
Nice.

4963
04:28:06,070 --> 04:28:06,370
We did it.

4964
04:28:06,410 --> 04:28:06,630
We did it.

4965
04:28:06,670 --> 04:28:06,870
We did it.

4966
04:28:06,910 --> 04:28:07,330
We did it.

4967
04:28:07,550 --> 04:28:07,870
Alright.

4968
04:28:08,030 --> 04:28:08,170
Alright.

4969
04:28:08,330 --> 04:28:10,770
Now that we did it, we might as well get the other guys too.

4970
04:28:11,050 --> 04:28:12,350
Okay, we completed him.

4971
04:28:14,190 --> 04:28:14,810
Let's see.

4972
04:28:14,810 --> 04:28:16,010
Yeah, we might as well.

4973
04:28:16,370 --> 04:28:18,390
To beat a hundred foes, we're using gauntlets?

4974
04:28:18,710 --> 04:28:19,290
Yeah, fuck it.

4975
04:28:19,330 --> 04:28:19,810
Might as well.

4976
04:28:21,670 --> 04:28:22,810
We might as well.

4977
04:28:23,610 --> 04:28:24,330
Fuck it.

4978
04:28:26,750 --> 04:28:27,930
Now it's fist time.

4979
04:28:28,070 --> 04:28:28,970
It's fisting time.

4980
04:28:29,990 --> 04:28:30,710
That's right.

4981
04:28:31,870 --> 04:28:33,010
It's time to fist.

4982
04:28:33,690 --> 04:28:34,590
Oh my god.

4983
04:28:34,610 --> 04:28:36,410
This feels so weak, guys.

4984
04:28:36,470 --> 04:28:37,670
Not gonna lie.

4985
04:28:40,470 --> 04:28:41,430
Holy shit.

4986
04:28:43,830 --> 04:28:45,090
It's fisting time.

4987
04:28:45,310 --> 04:28:45,410
It's fisting time.

4988
04:28:45,410 --> 04:28:46,090
That's fucking right.

4989
04:28:48,130 --> 04:28:48,990
That's right.

4990
04:28:50,110 --> 04:28:51,490
There's no way.

4991
04:28:51,610 --> 04:28:55,350
I'm pretty sure I can kill a hundred here.

4992
04:28:56,010 --> 04:28:57,130
The battle leader has rised.

4993
04:28:58,050 --> 04:28:59,050
You think I care about that?

4994
04:28:59,970 --> 04:29:01,110
I'm here to fist.

4995
04:29:04,110 --> 04:29:04,610
Come on.

4996
04:29:05,650 --> 04:29:06,170
Oh shit.

4997
04:29:08,370 --> 04:29:09,590
That's fucking right.

4998
04:29:09,590 --> 04:29:11,450
How am I still not at a hundred?

4999
04:29:12,170 --> 04:29:12,590
What?

5000
04:29:12,970 --> 04:29:13,350
Okay.

5001
04:29:15,810 --> 04:29:17,870
Oh, using battle arts.

5002
04:29:17,990 --> 04:29:18,710
Oh, whoops.

5003
04:29:21,330 --> 04:29:25,090
I forgot the most important part about this entire...

5004
04:29:25,090 --> 04:29:26,790
about the fisting mission.

5005
04:29:27,130 --> 04:29:28,770
I had to use battle arts.

5006
04:29:31,830 --> 04:29:33,070
Give me a sec.

5007
04:29:35,130 --> 04:29:36,190
Oh shit.

5008
04:29:36,330 --> 04:29:36,870
Give me a sec.

5009
04:29:39,590 --> 04:29:41,190
Oh my god, there's so many people.

5010
04:29:42,510 --> 04:29:42,810
Alright.

5011
04:29:43,890 --> 04:29:44,410
Nice.

5012
04:29:46,450 --> 04:29:47,470
What's going on?

5013
04:29:48,590 --> 04:29:48,750
What?

5014
04:29:50,790 --> 04:29:51,610
I read.

5015
04:29:52,130 --> 04:29:54,170
Sorry, it took me a while to read, but I read it.

5016
04:29:56,770 --> 04:29:57,490
You're right.

5017
04:29:57,550 --> 04:29:58,790
Fisting is already an art.

5018
04:30:02,990 --> 04:30:04,090
Alright, plus nine.

5019
04:30:05,190 --> 04:30:06,490
How much did I...

5020
04:30:07,730 --> 04:30:08,930
Nice, plus 24.

5021
04:30:08,930 --> 04:30:10,450
How much do I need?

5022
04:30:10,510 --> 04:30:11,510
Okay, I need a lot.

5023
04:30:12,890 --> 04:30:17,250
Fire arrows that follow enemies holding the button increases the number of arrows.

5024
04:30:17,970 --> 04:30:19,590
I can fire arrows?

5025
04:30:21,430 --> 04:30:22,630
Oh my god, it's time.

5026
04:30:23,450 --> 04:30:24,290
I did it.

5027
04:30:25,530 --> 04:30:26,930
I can finally use my...

5028
04:30:27,770 --> 04:30:29,410
the weapon that actually matters.

5029
04:30:29,950 --> 04:30:30,290
Alright.

5030
04:30:31,790 --> 04:30:32,450
Where's Guan Yun?

5031
04:30:33,450 --> 04:30:34,690
Where is he located?

5032
04:30:35,550 --> 04:30:36,390
I did it.

5033
04:30:36,390 --> 04:30:38,070
I completed the mission, Guan Yun.

5034
04:30:39,530 --> 04:30:40,470
Where is he?

5035
04:30:45,920 --> 04:30:46,420
Wait.

5036
04:30:47,180 --> 04:30:48,180
Oh, Dao Chan?

5037
04:30:49,140 --> 04:30:50,480
Bro, I don't want to talk to...

5038
04:30:51,660 --> 04:30:52,180
Bro.

5039
04:30:52,560 --> 04:30:55,420
I already maxed out my bond with him.

5040
04:30:55,520 --> 04:30:56,100
Oh shit.

5041
04:30:56,760 --> 04:30:59,760
Bro, how did I already maxed out my bond with him?

5042
04:31:01,240 --> 04:31:01,760
Oh.

5043
04:31:02,020 --> 04:31:03,720
When do I get to talk to him?

5044
04:31:03,940 --> 04:31:05,500
But I did the thing.

5045
04:31:05,500 --> 04:31:07,460
I did the thing.

5046
04:31:10,660 --> 04:31:12,120
Oh my god, okay.

5047
04:31:12,320 --> 04:31:13,960
I guess I'll talk to Dao Chan.

5048
04:31:14,440 --> 04:31:17,980
I guess I'll talk to him.

5049
04:31:19,500 --> 04:31:21,600
But where's Guan Yun?

5050
04:31:25,840 --> 04:31:27,660
Where is he?

5051
04:31:27,900 --> 04:31:29,440
I wanted to talk to

5052
04:31:33,310 --> 04:31:33,510
him.

5053
04:31:33,710 --> 04:31:35,450
I did all that for him.

5054
04:31:38,270 --> 04:31:40,090
Guan Yun.

5055
04:31:41,210 --> 04:31:43,010
Guan Yun.

5056
04:31:43,450 --> 04:31:43,670
Guan Yun.

5057
04:31:43,670 --> 04:31:46,370
How do you still want me to do missions for you?

5058
04:31:51,440 --> 04:31:52,480
Elimination again?

5059
04:31:53,340 --> 04:31:53,720
Okay.

5060
04:31:59,480 --> 04:32:00,440
Calm.

5061
04:32:01,440 --> 04:32:02,260
Sad calm.

5062
04:32:02,840 --> 04:32:03,360
Calm.

5063
04:32:04,880 --> 04:32:07,580
How do you have so many assassins?

5064
04:32:07,580 --> 04:32:07,620
How do you have so many assassins?

5065
04:32:09,500 --> 04:32:11,440
Like, I just helped you.

5066
04:32:14,240 --> 04:32:15,420
That's crazy.

5067
04:32:15,680 --> 04:32:17,260
I literally just helped you.

5068
04:32:17,580 --> 04:32:19,300
And you still need help?

5069
04:32:23,160 --> 04:32:24,120
Oh shit.

5070
04:32:28,520 --> 04:32:29,660
Oh my god.

5071
04:32:29,820 --> 04:32:31,380
Oh my god, what?

5072
04:32:31,620 --> 04:32:32,880
There's two of you guys now?

5073
04:32:35,460 --> 04:32:36,360
Oh my god.

5074
04:32:36,400 --> 04:32:36,460
Oh my god.

5075
04:32:36,460 --> 04:32:38,000
I'm getting fucked up right now.

5076
04:32:39,960 --> 04:32:40,680
Oh my god.

5077
04:32:40,700 --> 04:32:41,880
There's so many people here.

5078
04:32:48,590 --> 04:32:50,270
Oh, I missed the parry.

5079
04:32:51,770 --> 04:32:52,250
Nice.

5080
04:32:53,950 --> 04:32:54,970
That's fucking right.

5081
04:32:55,770 --> 04:32:56,650
Get out of here.

5082
04:32:57,450 --> 04:32:58,610
Get your ass out of here.

5083
04:33:00,190 --> 04:33:00,970
Fuck, okay.

5084
04:33:00,970 --> 04:33:01,010
Okay.

5085
04:33:03,070 --> 04:33:04,710
That's fucking right.

5086
04:33:07,330 --> 04:33:09,290
Come on.

5087
04:33:11,450 --> 04:33:12,090
Nice.

5088
04:33:12,810 --> 04:33:13,170
Cancel.

5089
04:33:16,770 --> 04:33:18,710
There's always an opening.

5090
04:33:20,110 --> 04:33:23,150
Jesus Christ, he's so fucking dead.

5091
04:33:24,470 --> 04:33:26,230
Still hitting him.

5092
04:33:27,830 --> 04:33:28,930
An opening.

5093
04:33:29,370 --> 04:33:29,970
An opening.

5094
04:33:30,350 --> 04:33:32,250
How many more openings do you want?

5095
04:33:32,970 --> 04:33:34,070
An opening.

5096
04:33:35,970 --> 04:33:37,010
An opening.

5097
04:33:40,190 --> 04:33:41,270
Okay, nice.

5098
04:33:43,350 --> 04:33:44,430
An opening.

5099
04:33:45,850 --> 04:33:46,970
An opening.

5100
04:33:56,230 --> 04:33:56,570
No.

5101
04:34:00,150 --> 04:34:02,590
Just all the openings, I guess.

5102
04:34:05,410 --> 04:34:07,130
Can I upgrade this?

5103
04:34:07,190 --> 04:34:07,790
No, not yet.

5104
04:34:10,230 --> 04:34:11,570
Alright, Diao Chan.

5105
04:34:12,430 --> 04:34:13,770
What do you want?

5106
04:34:15,430 --> 04:34:16,070
Alright.

5107
04:34:21,970 --> 04:34:23,290
Oh, no cutscene?

5108
04:34:37,930 --> 04:34:38,610
Cutscene?

5109
04:34:39,550 --> 04:34:39,790
Alright.

5110
04:34:41,990 --> 04:34:43,510
I'm gonna call it here.

5111
04:34:44,550 --> 04:34:47,470
I've accidentally raised my bonds with Diao Chan.

5112
04:34:47,830 --> 04:34:48,650
In one stream.

5113
04:34:48,770 --> 04:34:49,930
I literally met her today.

5114
04:34:49,930 --> 04:34:52,590
And I'm pretty sure we already maxed out our bonds.

5115
04:34:52,830 --> 04:34:54,950
I don't know how that was possible.

5116
04:34:55,150 --> 04:34:56,010
But like, okay.

5117
04:34:59,470 --> 04:35:01,570
I maxed out my bonds.

5118
04:35:02,110 --> 04:35:05,210
With the Dong and Diao Chan.

5119
04:35:05,570 --> 04:35:07,990
Out of all the people I was talking to.

5120
04:35:08,330 --> 04:35:10,750
I maxed out the bonds.

5121
04:35:11,150 --> 04:35:14,330
With people who I didn't think I would max out on.

5122
04:35:15,290 --> 04:35:16,250
And that was fun.

5123
04:35:17,010 --> 04:35:18,050
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

5124
04:35:18,050 --> 04:35:19,430
I'm so sad that like...

5125
04:35:20,270 --> 04:35:21,070
PC actually...

5126
04:35:21,070 --> 04:35:22,450
Oh wait, what are you still doing here?

5127
04:35:22,510 --> 04:35:22,950
Get out.

5128
04:35:25,030 --> 04:35:26,150
Sorry, not you guys.

5129
04:35:26,590 --> 04:35:28,010
This random stream here.

5130
04:35:29,150 --> 04:35:30,790
Thank you for the super chat.

5131
04:35:31,190 --> 04:35:33,190
The next mission has Lu Bu.

5132
04:35:33,530 --> 04:35:35,330
I recommend you keep going just one more.

5133
04:35:35,670 --> 04:35:37,970
I think it'd be cooler if I start off...

5134
04:35:37,970 --> 04:35:39,510
The next mission with Lu Bu.

5135
04:35:40,670 --> 04:35:42,770
Start off the next part with Lu Bu.

5136
04:35:42,890 --> 04:35:43,830
I think I'm gonna go with that.

5137
04:35:43,910 --> 04:35:44,610
Let me save my game.

5138
04:35:44,610 --> 04:35:45,710
I almost forgot to save my game.

5139
04:35:45,910 --> 04:35:46,370
Holy fuck.

5140
04:35:47,150 --> 04:35:48,950
After everything I've been through too.

5141
04:35:50,550 --> 04:35:52,210
Oh my god, I wish my game didn't...

5142
04:35:52,210 --> 04:35:54,610
My PC didn't literally fucking explode there.

5143
04:35:58,510 --> 04:35:59,550
I wish...

5144
04:35:59,550 --> 04:36:02,730
My PC didn't explode at last minute.

5145
04:36:03,530 --> 04:36:05,390
Like in the middle of the stream.

5146
04:36:05,470 --> 04:36:06,170
That was crazy.

5147
04:36:06,310 --> 04:36:09,290
A thousand kills and then my PC fucking exploded.

5148
04:36:09,730 --> 04:36:10,930
Like a thousand what?

5149
04:36:12,710 --> 04:36:13,670
You're like...

5150
04:36:13,670 --> 04:36:15,030
No, no, no, no, no.

5151
04:36:15,990 --> 04:36:17,050
We're not here.

5152
04:36:17,610 --> 04:36:18,350
We cannot.

5153
04:36:18,670 --> 04:36:20,830
We cannot handle a thousand kills.

5154
04:36:21,990 --> 04:36:23,290
But that was fun.

5155
04:36:23,670 --> 04:36:24,210
That was fun.

5156
04:36:24,290 --> 04:36:25,750
I had a great time playing...

5157
04:36:26,610 --> 04:36:27,930
Dynasty Warriors as always.

5158
04:36:28,130 --> 04:36:31,230
I think next week I might do two parts of Dynasty Warriors.

5159
04:36:31,510 --> 04:36:33,790
Because this game is incredibly long.

5160
04:36:34,030 --> 04:36:35,190
So I don't wanna like...

5161
04:36:35,190 --> 04:36:36,370
I don't know if I can...

5162
04:36:36,370 --> 04:36:39,770
I don't wanna be like it's three months and I'm still playing Dynasty Warriors.

5163
04:36:39,770 --> 04:36:43,330
So we're gonna have two streams for Dynasty Warriors next week.

5164
04:36:43,550 --> 04:36:45,690
We have two collabs.

5165
04:36:46,070 --> 04:36:47,970
One was actually from the Chariot Auction.

5166
04:36:48,670 --> 04:36:49,810
A collab where...

5167
04:36:50,950 --> 04:36:52,670
Where someone won...

5168
04:36:52,670 --> 04:36:53,610
One of the Chariot Auctions.

5169
04:36:53,830 --> 04:36:56,270
Where I was collabing with a person of their choice.

5170
04:36:56,870 --> 04:36:57,470
So...

5171
04:36:57,470 --> 04:36:59,730
And the other collab would be...

5172
04:36:59,730 --> 04:37:00,950
The Sloppy Sisters collab.

5173
04:37:01,470 --> 04:37:02,590
Where I proposed...

5174
04:37:02,590 --> 04:37:05,910
I was the one that suggested it because I wanted to play the Headliners.

5175
04:37:06,210 --> 04:37:08,630
So next week we're playing the Headliners.

5176
04:37:08,630 --> 04:37:10,930
With LimeWizSnuffy and Mintz.

5177
04:37:10,990 --> 04:37:12,430
I actually suggested the collab.

5178
04:37:12,550 --> 04:37:13,410
Because I was like...

5179
04:37:13,410 --> 04:37:15,350
I really wanted to play Headliners with some people.

5180
04:37:15,770 --> 04:37:18,090
And I figured that the game seems incredibly fun.

5181
04:37:18,450 --> 04:37:19,030
So yeah.

5182
04:37:19,450 --> 04:37:21,790
I brought the Sloppy Sisters back together.

5183
04:37:22,210 --> 04:37:24,130
For more four person collabs.

5184
04:37:24,510 --> 04:37:25,270
What's the game?

5185
04:37:25,550 --> 04:37:26,330
I don't know.

5186
04:37:27,390 --> 04:37:28,830
I don't know how to explain it.

5187
04:37:28,970 --> 04:37:31,930
It seemed really interesting when I was looking at the trailer.

5188
04:37:32,790 --> 04:37:34,490
It's basically we're journalists.

5189
04:37:34,910 --> 04:37:36,230
And we're trying to...

5190
04:37:36,230 --> 04:37:38,090
It's basically like...

5191
04:37:38,090 --> 04:37:39,190
Lethal... What was it?

5192
04:37:39,230 --> 04:37:39,930
Not Lethal Company.

5193
04:37:40,430 --> 04:37:42,330
What's the other one where you try to...

5194
04:37:44,170 --> 04:37:46,210
What's the other one that's sort of like Lethal Company.

5195
04:37:46,270 --> 04:37:48,210
But it's not like the one where we're taping...

5196
04:37:48,210 --> 04:37:49,670
Video streamers and stuff.

5197
04:37:50,230 --> 04:37:52,050
It's sort of like that, but we're journalists.

5198
04:37:52,230 --> 04:37:52,390
Yeah.

5199
04:37:52,990 --> 04:37:53,630
Content warning.

5200
04:37:53,710 --> 04:37:55,950
It's like content warning, but we're journalists instead.

5201
04:37:56,450 --> 04:37:57,090
But yeah.

5202
04:37:57,450 --> 04:37:59,470
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

5203
04:38:00,350 --> 04:38:01,710
As always everybody.

5204
04:38:01,990 --> 04:38:02,810
Stay hydrated.

5205
04:38:03,030 --> 04:38:03,530
Posture check.

5206
04:38:03,530 --> 04:38:05,530
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5207
04:38:05,650 --> 04:38:07,650
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

5208
04:38:07,790 --> 04:38:09,150
Cause you deserve it.

5209
04:38:09,270 --> 04:38:10,670
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

5210
04:38:11,230 --> 04:38:12,110
Bye guys.

5211
04:38:12,490 --> 04:38:12,970
Bye.
