1
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:45,060
Hello, hello, hello, sorry I had to loop because my food
literally got here like 10 minutes before I was supposed to

2
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:53,050
start the stream And I was like, oh shit, and I was like,
um, yum yum during the loop Um, by me and now I have several

3
00:03:53,050 --> 00:04:00,310
updates to give you guys First off, the most important
update I might be sick very soon You guys might be like,

4
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,870
Toki, how do you know that?

5
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,450
Are you like, can you tell the future or some shit?

6
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:11,010
Well, um, I could tell because when I woke up, this is
always the sign where i'm like oh i'm gonna be sick soon i

7
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:20,190
can feel it um but uh basically uh i woke up and i felt my
my throat being sore and you know that's like the first sign

8
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:28,230
where you're like oh no this is gonna get worse soon so
she's psychic she can tell the future burner she's a witch

9
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:40,990
but yeah so i feel the sore throat hitting right now so um
that's when you know it's gonna get worse uh next couple and

10
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:47,170
because of that i realized i ran out of like over the
counter um over the counter yeah i got orange juice right

11
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:57,830
now i order orange juice with my with my sandwich um but
then like so then i ordered like dayquil um uh on uber eats

12
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:04,330
and then it's really funny because i think this is a new
thing but you need an id now if you're like ordering if

13
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:13,770
you're ordering medication off the Because I was like, what
if they're like, oh, remember to, uh, you have to meet the,

14
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,550
meet the guy, delivery guy.

15
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,190
So you can scan, they can scan your ID.

16
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,530
And I mean, like, I guess like too many chills.

17
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,050
I guess like, cause my, the one I got was like maximum
strength.

18
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,930
So you gotta make sure I'm not like under 18.

19
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,790
And I'm like some child trying to get high on pain meds or
some shit.

20
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,190
So yeah.

21
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,910
So I got the X maximum strength dayquil.

22
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:45,570
Just to be sure, you know, I'm, I'm like starting early
because I can tell that it's, I can tell it's coming.

23
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,850
So I was like, if I start early, then I can stop it maybe
before it happens.

24
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,670
You know, it's like a premonition.

25
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,230
It's like final destination.

26
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,670
I'm being like, stop.

27
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,230
We got to leave.

28
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:05,950
We got to leave before the virus comes or maximum strength.

29
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:14,630
um so yeah i may or that final medication i may or may not
get very sick in the next couple of days which sucks because

00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:51,930
haircut in a while because i was so fucking busy and you
know if you're a woman being in a hair salon takes like at

162
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:59,610
least one hour depend just for a haircut by the way like all
you women girls you know what i'm saying and then like so it

163
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:07,090
takes like at least an hour just for like um just for a
haircut and like blow dry or something like that if you want

164
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:14,250
to dye your hair because they're like you want to dye your
hair and i was like no that's fine like um my my roots are

165
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:20,490
now at the path like like where my eyes are like that's
where my roots are because i was just like no it's okay i

166
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:27,410
really want to sit on a chair for two to three hours today i
was just like um no that's all right i really don't want to

167
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:35,410
sit on the chair for that long um that day so i was just
like um it's okay i'll come back next time but also i just

168
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:41,650
wanted to test the salon out too because like you know it
was a western hair salon so like not my usual asian hair

169
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:52,850
salon i usually go to like a chinese or Korean hair salon
for my haircuts um anyway so uh so I you know it was also by

170
00:15:52,850 --> 00:16:01,150
the way it was also like a hundred like almost like a
hundred dollars too for guys okay so I don't know men have

171
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:07,830
it really easy when it comes to like barber shop because
they're like choo choo choo here's like $15 um for women

172
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:22,280
hair salon it's like cut hair shampoo uh blow dry hundred
dollars and like by the way it was like 80 was the base

173
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:34,660
price too so yeah so it was like yeah and it's like pretty
normalized for us I don't fucking know why yeah so it was

174
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:43,720
like a hundred dollars and I was like okay um anyway hey but
the girl who worked on my hair apparently won a lot of

175
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:52,100
awards so I really that happy with my hair cut but i don't
think she works on asian people because like it's like

176
00:16:52,100 --> 00:17:01,000
really weird so um um i guess it's like a western hair like
style for hair so i was just like i was like oh i want you

177
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,720
to thin my hair um i want you to thin my hair because it's
like i grow hair a lot so she was like yeah you have a lot

178
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:17,540
of hair it's like yeah no you have a lot so i was like can
you like thin my hair and uh i just like i want to cut my

179
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:23,500
hair like i want to like shorten it so like i showed her
like i want it to be this length and then and yet she didn't

180
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,860
even get it to that length she like kept it long like still
like sort of long but like she didn't cut a lot off but like

181
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:36,220
i said i had a lot of hair growing down so i was just like i
need you to cut like this much but she's still also like it

182
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,080
wasn't as much as i wanted at that point i was just

183
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:56,000
um the thing is um she like it's weird i don't know how this
okay it's like it's like uh it's like flat okay okay i'll

184
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,740
draw it out i'll try it when she cut it i looked at it i was
like that's i'm not used to it but i guess like for western

185
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:10,680
hairstyle that's how they usually do it so it was like okay
so i'm drawing this out on paint right now so like when she

186
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,820
cut it it was like sharp ass like like a line

187
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:28,600
Like Like it's a line Okay I'll do like a comparison Of what
what like an Asian Hair styles usually would do versus like

188
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:35,720
I guess like a Western hairstylist Because I was not used to
that Like she did this as if it's like a normal Thing and I

189
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:42,680
was like what the so it's like This like it's like a line
But then like if you go to an Asian hair salon long it's

190
00:18:42,680 --> 00:19:00,280
like like this okay i'll show you guys it's like this you
know okay that's the head and that's so it's like it's not

191
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:08,440
just a line like do you guys understand what i'm talking
about it's not just a line it's like so it was like yeah

192
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,520
like it was so weird because i looked in the mirror I was
like, why is it okay?

193
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:20,000
Like, yeah, okay, I'll give you guys a side-by-side.

194
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,120
I have to redraw it, though, because I just saved over it.

195
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:29,780
So, it's like, like, front and back, too.

196
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,240
It was so fucking weird.

197
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,420
But I was just like, I don't know if we can fix this.

198
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,460
I don't think you're used to.

199
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,700
I don't think you're used to, like, cutting Asian hairstyle.

200
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,620
I don't think I don't want to I don't want to risk it
because let's like like I know I don't go outside much but

201
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:56,200
then when I do go outside I don't want anything to be like
weird so so this is like the western hairstyle and this is

202
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:06,880
like the Asian hairstyle we're like you know what I mean
it's like an Asian hairstyle it's like like um there's like

203
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:14,100
I guess like dimensions to it but then like the western
hairstyle is just like like just just get a scissors and go

204
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,200
and then just cut

205
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:29,160
yeah so like so this would be the western style yeah it's
like this is yeah this is like the Asian hairstyle too yeah

206
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:37,580
like this it was just so weird I'm not used to that at all
so no but the thing is she like had her all her awards

207
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:46,560
displayed too she had like all her awards displayed and
apparently she's like she was like master three hairstylists

208
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:57,980
um um and uh and it's like it like she had her base price
was 80 to be fair i just booked like whoever was free like i

209
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:04,700
didn't really care who i got i was like um i want an
appointment at this time and like whoever's free i'll get it

210
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:12,580
you know i've always gone to an asian hair salon and like
never had to be specific on like how they cut my hair and it

211
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:20,440
always is like this so i was just like yeah master three is
her grandmaster is her top five and then she had all her

212
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:29,580
awards put like displayed at the front of the mirror and it
was like oh number one hairstyle like 2025 number one

213
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:42,900
hairstylist at this hair salon i was like oh okay so the
price was like worth it you know like so um so i was like

214
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:48,840
okay so i guess i guess the it's it's all right like and
then she's like oh and then she's like do you want to get

215
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:55,220
your hair dials like i can match it and the thing is when
i'm at my eight like she's like oh i can match it to your to

216
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:06,120
the color um and just do your roots and stuff i was just
like oh and i i felt like a I had like red flags for it

217
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:13,680
because in my Asian hair salons, if my roots get too much,
if I like don't get my hair dyed like in time to cover the

218
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,980
roots and the roots spread too far, my Asian hairstylist
would be like, we need to dye the whole thing.

219
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,540
Like it's better to dye the whole thing.

220
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,080
So there's no mismatch of colors.

221
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,080
So I was just like, so then I'm like, that's weird that
you're like, oh, we'll just fix, I can just do the roots and

222
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,060
I can match this color.

223
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,460
And I was like,

224
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:47,380
i was just like i i don't can you though i'm not very
confident that you can but like yeah i'll definitely come

225
00:22:47,380 --> 00:23:00,180
back i'll i was just like yeah yeah i'll come back i'll come
back to do it next time i just yeah sure yeah questioning

226
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:07,540
your master three hair sounds because i've never because
usually it would just do the whole head just to make sure

227
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:14,900
that the colors fully there's no like mismatch of colors if
I haven't gotten dyed in a long time so and that's what it's

228
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:21,460
usually been since I've been growing up so it's just so
weird that she I I've never had a I don't know I don't I'm

229
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:28,620
not a hairstylist so I I'm not sure like if um if that's
natural thing or if I'm just getting scammed like they just

230
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:37,160
wanted me to pay more but um I was just worried that she
won't actually match the colors.

231
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:44,900
Because I was like, do you really know my actual color of my
hair dye?

232
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,660
Because I don't know.

233
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,360
I don't know if you actually do.

234
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,760

Thank you.

245
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,400
I don't know how to sing happy birthday in Español, but I
know I sing Merry Christmas.

246
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,880
Feliz Navida.

247
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,860
Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, that AZE.

248
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,320
Whoa!

249
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,860
I want to wish you a happy birthday.

250
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,200
I want to wish you a happy birthday.

251
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:45,340
Happy birthday, bum, bum, bum, bum, nah, nah, nah, yeah,
happy birthday, yeah, I'm not close enough.

252
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,360
So, yeah, most likely I won't come back.

253
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,660
It's just weird.

254
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,740
I did not like, I did not like that she did this.

255
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,860
It's just, it, it's like a straight line.

256
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,220
It's so fucking weird.

257
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,920
But, like, my hair is so long.

258
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,060
It's not like it's a bob cut or something.

259
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,240
But it feels like a nap.

260
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:09,860
I don't know.

261
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,340
For me, it's, like, super unnatural.

262
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,600
Like, it just feels so straight.

263
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,640
It was just like.

264
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,160
It, I don't, yeah.

265
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:28,220
It's just too, like, when I looked in the mirror, I was
like, I was just like, oh, my God.

266
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,140
Why is it so straight?

267
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:44,780
and i've never had that before like i've never had like i
just i just never had a hairstyle like that because it's

268
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:51,220
always been like this where where it's like layered and it's
like po po po po po like it's like like you know little

269
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:58,020
triangles you know at the bottom like it's not like like i
like yeah

270
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,060
It's the best I can describe it.

271
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,580
I'm definitely going to go back to my Asian hair salon.

272
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,460
I was like debating about it too.

273
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,140
I was like, do I just wait another day?

274
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,400
And I was like, no, my hair.

275
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,500
My hair is way too fucking long.

276
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,240
I cannot handle this right now.

277
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,380
Oh, another update.

278
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,460
Another update.

279
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,460
I got another email.

280
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,820
That's what I know.

281
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,380
This guy definitely doesn't watch me.

282
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,540
I got another email from him.

283
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,220
All right.

284
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,680
Anyway, this is where I'm last.

285
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,900
Even my manager was like, bro, he's back.

286
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,680
I was like, he's back?

287
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,000
Just no, no.

288
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,460
For a recap of what the fuck I'm talking about.

289
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,500
There's this guy that's been sending me emails since the
last week.

290
00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:00,540
And because he's been trying to get me to reach out to this
other VTuber who have zero connection with.

291
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,700
For some fucking reason, he thinks like me and her are like
friends or some shit.

292
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:12,900
And he's been trying to get me to reach out to her and be
like, Hey, there's this fucking creepy ass stalker that's

293
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,220
been trying to get a hold of you.

294
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,140
Like, I don't know why the fuck he thinks I'm the one.

295
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,420
I think he's like, I don't know.

296
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,880
Maybe he's been messaging a lot of people too.

297
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,620
But like, this email is directly to me.

298
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,460
So I don't know if he's like typing several different
emails.

299
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,260
No, you're like, can you block it?

300
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,780
But the thing is, it's like, at this point, it's like
interesting.

301
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:39,680
guy so like it's like i don't i didn't block him because at
this point i'm like curious what he's gonna send me next um

302
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:55,400
so so anyway new email like his new email was like hey can
you ask this vtuber to stay up tonight because i'm gonna

303
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:05,280
play this song and this song is like my message to her and
i'm like how the like I guess like there's different answers

304

00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:09,890

352
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:10,290

Thank you.

356
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,670
Oh, my God.

357
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:19,550
Oh, I also got another email about, like, okay, it's fucking
weird.

358
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,350
Do not stalk VTubers, guys.

359
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,350
It's weird.

360
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:31,510
But, like, I also got another email from, like, this other
VTuber, and they're like, whoa, are you talking about this

361
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:31,770
guy?

362
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:39,910
It was not about this guy by the way but then they're like
this guy is like a serial liar or some shit and like um like

363
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:49,230
like just don't stalk people in general that is fucking
creepy please get some help um um anyway so um like they

364
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:55,390
were like they send me an email and no it's my business
email guys like and then they assume that i'm the only one

365
00:33:55,390 --> 00:34:01,790
that reads my business email and not my fucking staff team
like i've had people email email my business email thinking

366
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:10,890
they're talking to me and when they're also talking to my
staff as well so anyway and then this guy apparently was

367
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:17,450
like lying to like a bunch of like really small content
creators like this different guy by the way this is a

368
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:25,810
different guy where like i worked with this guy to create my
skin suit and they're like And then apparently this guy was

369
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:34,450
telling very small VTubers that they were like, he was like,
yeah, I was the one that gave her the concept to make her

370
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:40,890
new skin suit, the bounty hunter one, to make her bounty
hunter skin suit, a tomboy skin suit.

371
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,270
And I'm like, who the fuck is this guy?

372
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,530
I was just like, what?

373
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:57,410
Bro, only two people knew about the conceptual art of my
bounty hunting one.

374
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:02,830
And it was me and my manager while I was trying to figure
out how it should look like.

375
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,970
Bro thinks he's part of the team.

376
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:10,870
And then apparently this guy was claiming...

377
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:17,590
that like, that I consulted with him to how the skin suit
was gonna look like.

378
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:23,710
When we joined the behind the scenes, I was like fucking
telling you guys about how hard it was to figure this out

379
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,550
with me and my manager trying to figure out.

380
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:31,410
Like, yeah, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like,
what the fuck do you mean?

381
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:38,130
The only third party studio that worked on my debut was
literally like the whole giant videos for it.

382
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:43,530
But that was after the Bounty Hunter's skin suit model was
done.

383
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:54,970
Yeah, he like self-inserted himself, like, into, like, the
story that he made up being, like, I was the one that gave

384
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,830
her the idea that it should be a tomboy.

385
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:02,410
And I'm like, bro, everyone knew I was going to make a
tomboy model.

386
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,290
Like, like...

387
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,350
That's so...

388
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,310
It was like stolen value.

389
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,030
He believed in the lies so hard.

390
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:17,570
Yeah.

391
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:22,930
So like this random VT was asking me like, oh, did you
actually work with this guy?

392
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,870
Or, and like how like he knows me.

393
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:25,970
And I'm like, who the fuck?

394
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:26,710
Okay, I'll say it.

395
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,710
Who the fuck is Matt?

396
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:35,670
They're like, they're like, do you know Matt by any chance?

397
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,110
And I'm like, who the fuck is Matt?

398
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:38,550
Matt.

399
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,610
Like, no, I do not know.

400
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:45,850
Nobody on my staff team is named Matt.

401
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:46,550
Like,

402
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,570
yeah, Matt Pat from the game three, bro.

403
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,890
It was me, Matt.

404
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,790
Do you get to give this super chat?

405
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,570
Thank you.

406
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:05,470
The VTubing Cena is wild, bro.

407
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,410
Yeah, I know.

408
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,110
I was just like, I'm like, thank you.

409
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,710
Like, who the fuck is this guy claiming to work for me?

410
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,490
That's just a theory.

411
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,390
A game theory.

412
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:20,610
All right.

413
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:21,910
Anyway.

414
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:23,810
Anyway.

415
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,330
And then, like, they were like, we were unable to vet any of
his stories.

416
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,710
I mean, if he doesn't show any proof, that means none of his
stories are real.

417
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:35,690
Because, like, you would think that, like, if he was so
excited, like, he got to work with me.

418
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,950
That he would have a screenshot.

419
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:47,950
of him telling me that it's like you should have a tomboy
model and be like oh my god i guess i should if you if they

420
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:57,250
do not provide any evidence slash screenshots of all these
lies that he's claiming of then most likely they are lies

421
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:10,050
it's because he's signing nda or some shit yeah but if it
debuted already then you can show it like that working for

422
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:19,210
you was his theory his game theory uh raccoon thank you for
the super chat thank you thank you hey doky it was my

423
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:26,030
birthday yesterday can you belated happy birthday from me of
course raccoon of course happy birthday to you happy

424
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:34,010
birthday to you happy birthday dear raccoon happy birthday
to you yeah happy birthday

425
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,170
Anyway, story time's over.

426
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,370
It's gaming for real.

427
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:48,010
So, um, as a fellow, Matt, the council of Matt, this owns
this creep.

428
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,550
Council, thank you for the super chat.

429
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,250
Thank you, thank you.

430
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,170
By the way, Matt's a different guy.

431
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,950
Matt's a different guy, apparently.

432
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:57,150
The other one, I won't say his name because he's still
emailing me.

433
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:04,830
So, um, so like, um, if he does something, like, beyond
creepy than what he is doing now, then I will, like, say his

434
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,390
name out.

435
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:08,110
But, like, for now, the other guy is not Matt.

436
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:16,670
this the one that was lying about working for me is matt
yeah this is like since the other guy is an ongoing

437
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:26,770
situation uh i won't reveal his name yet um this is the only
way to and like eventually he will stop if you shame him

438
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:36,110
enough he will stop for those who are like why are you why
are you giving him attention or give like enabling this i am

439
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:44,390
not i am shaming him because that's they can they'll learn
shaming people like shaming people works and this is um this

440
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:51,330
is actually how you can get them to stop because i've had
that scenario before i i talked about the memory stream um

441
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:58,670
but like i've had um no that's the thing i've had this
happen before and i did the thing where i just ignored it

442
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:07,710
this was before people in the memory stream heard this story
before but um um i've had a very similar situation and it

443
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:14,450
was like directed at me and it was back in the barth night's
time so back before corporal and everything and basically

444
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:21,770
they didn't stop until i publicly shamed them on social
media and then they stop so like it gets to a point where

445
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:30,310
you literally cannot ignore them and it's the only way it
gets them to fucking realize that it is bad like it's wrong

446
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:50,130
yeah so it's why i do it it's the only way all right anyway
also another thing i heard about this game um is that uh is

447
00:40:50,130 --> 00:41:01,130
that basically it can this game depends on your rng and
basically it can go from two hours or ten hours just

448
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:09,470
depending on how fucked uh how fuck your luck is to green to
the terms of service.

449
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:12,150
So we're gonna see how this goes, guys.

450
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,410
Yeah, live and die by RNG.

451
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,150
I've seen VTubers take two hours.

452
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,010
I've seen VTubers take 20 hours.

453
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:25,790
So let's hope that it doesn't get to that point.

454
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,330
Rick, thank you for the super chat.

455

Okay.

00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,170
The whole point is to just agree to terms of service.

488
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:13,690
Oh, okay, I was gonna say it.

489
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,070

All right.

498
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:10,060
You're just going to consider it to be hidden feature that
you may share it as you are discovering it.

499
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,660
Use your shell.

500
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,700

01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:41,060
Where are you hiding, little one?

795
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,180

801
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:14,390
I was like, oh, okay, I pushed it.

802
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:15,030

803
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:15,690
Disagree?

01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:20,570
I just disagree, right?

805
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:25,030
All right, we should put this all over here.

806
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:30,070
Oh, man, I'm so sad.

807
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:32,070
That would have been a god run.

01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:38,370
That would have been, What could have been...

809
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:43,910
What could have been...

810
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:46,930
Truly the run of all time!

811
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:51,270
I'm still thinking about it, guys.

812
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:54,210
I don't even know how that game was played.

813
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:58,910
No, Doki, go quicker.

814
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:02,710

try?

01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:03,950
I remember.

816
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:10,150
All right, we'll take it more slow this time.

817
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:11,550
There it is.

818
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:20,150
What?

819
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:31,850
Am I turning it the wrong way?

820
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:35,070
What other way can I turn this?

821
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:44,070
I'm spinning it?

822
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:47,210
Speed?

823
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,340
I'm still spinning it?

824
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,740
How much faster can I go?

825
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:04,480
Am I spinning it the right wrong way?

826
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:08,240
I'm spinning it the other way.

827
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:10,020
Lefty, righty.

828
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:17,750
Oh my god.

829
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:20,030
Spin!

830
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:32,490
Guys, I don't think we're going to make it.

831
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:38,610
I couldn't understand.

832
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:40,670
I just went and disagreed.

833
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:44,090
I couldn't figure it out, so I'll disagree.

834
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:47,630
Disagree.

835
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:49,010
Disagree.

836
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,360
I didn't know.

837
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,280
I was so confused.

838
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,180
I X'd it out.

839
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,100
Because it wouldn't show up.

840
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:08,710
Oh.

841
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:12,980
Oh, there it is.

842
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:16,840
Okay.

843
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,700
All right.

844
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,540
Oh my god, not you again.

845
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,220
Not you again.

846
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,200
Alright.

847
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:37,020
We're gonna be a little more strategic with this.

848
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:43,470
Oh my god.

849
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:45,170
Just...

850
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:47,050
Alright.

851
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:48,830
There we go.

852
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:54,730
It is possible.

853
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:58,770
Oh my god.

854
01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:59,130
It's fine.

855
01:09:59,290 --> 01:09:59,490
It's fine.

856
01:09:59,650 --> 01:09:59,810
It's fine.

857
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:00,610
We don't need that.

858
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:03,190
Okay.

859
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:07,330
We're just going to be a little bit more...

860
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:09,110
We're building a foundation, guys.

861
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:10,670
Oh, my God.

862
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:11,050
It's fine.

863
01:10:11,230 --> 01:10:11,470
It's fine.

864
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:13,990
We're building a foundation here.

865
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:16,190
It's like a house.

866
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:23,490
Oh, my God.

867
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:24,190
You fucker.

868
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:27,210
Oh, my God.

869
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:27,670
There we go.

870
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:28,230
There we go.

871
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:29,270
Foundation built.

872
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:34,150
Okay, give me this.

873
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:36,690
It's here somewhere.

874
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:39,610
I disagree.

875
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:43,710
Disagree.

876
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:44,910
Disagree.

877
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:46,030
Disagree.

878
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:50,990
Where are you?

879
01:10:51,970 --> 01:10:55,850
Where are you?

880
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:03,610
Oh my god, I can't find you!

881
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:08,450
It moved!

882
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:19,730
Oh my god, there's so many moving.

883
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:21,870
Where are you?

884
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:23,210
Where did he go?

885
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:30,350
I'm so where did he go?

886
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:31,450
I'm there.

887
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:32,070
I saw it.

888
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:33,090
You saw where?

889
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:34,510
Where did you see it?

890
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:34,870
Wait.

891
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:37,470
Oh, I see it.

01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:38,750
I see it.

894
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:39,170
I see it.

895
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:40,250
I found him.

896
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:46,110
Oh, okay.

897
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:46,970
This is fine.

898
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:49,490
Agra.

899
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:52,190
Agri.

01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:52,630
Agri.

901
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:15,110
I was like, yo, why would you do this to me?

902
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:17,150
Why would you do this?

903
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:18,570
I'm not a robot.

904
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,990
I was like, he's there, right?

905
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:26,470
I don't know.

906
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:28,570
That's disagree.

907
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:30,390

912
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:42,850

I messed up.

915
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:59,290
I actually think I can make it.

916
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:03,910
There's no way left to agree.

917
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:07,530
No!

918
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:10,770
I didn't make it.

919
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:15,630

I figured it out.

935
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:48,790
I did not figure it out.

936
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,440
Oh, yeah.

01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,440
I don't understand this one.

941
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,440
I'm spinning it.

942
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,560
Guys, how do we do this one?

943
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:09,740

I...

945
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,440
spin, but yet nothing comes out.

946
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:20,550
It's the run killer.

947
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:29,190
Users said it was fun, it was interesting, it helps increase
their motivations to continue.

948
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:36,340
I can't write on anything.

949
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,180
Oh, the righty-tidy, lefty, loosey?

950

01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,040
That's so messed up.

955
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:57,600
That's actually so messed up that that's a run killer.

956
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:04,290
Okay.

draw?

They gave me a couple of sticks for this.

01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:45,840
There we go.

1116
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:55,460
That's fine.

1117
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,960
Give me too many sticks.

Oh, no.

1119
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,120
I fucked it up already.

1120
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:07,960
I already fucked it up.

1121
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:16,360
They gave me too many sticks, guys.

1122
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:26,390
They gave me too many sticks.

1123
01:33:40,590 --> 01:33:41,950
There you go.

1124
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:44,310
What the fuck?

It's over.

1128
01:34:14,710 --> 01:34:15,730
It's over.

1129
01:34:16,410 --> 01:34:19,290
I don't know how to construct.

1130
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:21,630
I don't know how to salvage this.

1131
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:24,050
It's over.

1132
01:34:24,370 --> 01:34:26,170
It's already over.

1133
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:28,570
I already messed it up.

1134
01:34:30,050 --> 01:34:32,250
Like, I died down.

1135
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:38,650
I know when to quit.

1136
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:40,110
I know.

1137
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:45,650
I know when it's time to clock out.

1138
01:34:52,110 --> 01:34:55,470
I understand now why this took people 10 hours.

1139
01:35:03,790 --> 01:35:05,310
I told you guys.

1140
01:35:05,410 --> 01:35:05,890
It's just all.

1141
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:06,690
RNG.

1142
01:35:07,950 --> 01:35:09,490
It's just all RNG.

1143
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,640
I had the luckiest run of my life.

1144
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:24,510
I got why is this?

1145
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:25,390
Release!

1146
01:35:28,930 --> 01:35:29,450
There you go.

1147
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:30,990
Why?

1148
01:35:32,730 --> 01:35:33,990
Oh my god.

1149
01:35:37,330 --> 01:35:38,890
Oh my god.

1150
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:44,220
There you go.

1151
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:44,540
There you go.

1152
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,380
That should be perfect.

1153
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:50,320
I swear to God this thing's blocked.

1154
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:50,700

1155
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:51,520

1156
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:53,020
I swear to God.

1157
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:53,800
I swear.

1158
01:35:53,980 --> 01:35:54,320
That's right.

1159
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:54,980
Get over here.

1160
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:55,440
Get over.

1161
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:59,580
I was like, get your ass over here.

1162
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:06,670
All right.

1163
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:10,690
Oh, I hate this one.

1164
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:16,790
Oh, my God.

1165
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:18,050
This one's hard.

1166
01:36:18,670 --> 01:36:19,310
I'm good.

1167
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:24,170
Like, head-on coordination, even this one is frustrating
because it's so tiny.

1168
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:29,660
There we go.

1169
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:32,640
This one's so hard.

1170
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:35,180
Like, what?

1171
01:36:40,450 --> 01:36:40,950
What?

1172
01:36:53,050 --> 01:36:54,950
Okay, I got so confused.

1173
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:56,910
I was like, what am I fucking doing here?

1174
01:36:58,270 --> 01:37:02,930
He's like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1175
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:05,810
I'm like, what is he trying to sell me?

1176
01:37:07,550 --> 01:37:08,730
Oh, God, not this one.

1177
01:37:15,150 --> 01:37:23,150
Get out of here Do I do it faster slow?

1178
01:37:25,670 --> 01:37:28,240
No, no!

1179
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:35,300
I don't remember how How did I do it before?

1180
01:37:41,870 --> 01:37:43,070
How did it work?

1181
01:37:59,090 --> 01:38:02,630
Oh, no This needs to be at the end

1182
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:09,860
Oh, no

1183
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:22,740
Oh, yay!

1184
01:38:26,830 --> 01:38:28,230
Alright, yeah.

1185
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:33,430

It's a fucking curse.

01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:01,760
A fucking curse I get Toho.

1228
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:05,460
I'm so sad.

1229
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:09,800
A fucking curse it gives me Toho.

1230
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:13,000
The one thing.

1231
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:15,720
I did not need.

1232
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:19,480
And it's one try.

1233
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:22,240
It's one try.

1234
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:27,220
Oh my god.

1235
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:31,020
Where is my butt?

1236
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:38,500
Oh, the past one was actually one of the easiest ones.

1237
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,520
Or my last one.

1238
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:44,340
Regrets.

1239
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:45,860
So many regrets.

1240
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:48,820
So many regrets.

1241
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:56,250
It was so nice to me before.

1242
01:44:56,830 --> 01:44:58,630
It was so nice to me.

1243
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:04,260
Okay.

1244
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:06,060
I fumbled it.

1245
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:08,040
I fumbled it so hard.

1246
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:12,320
It truly was the fumble of the century.

1247
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:18,460
No.

1248
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:19,000
No.

1249
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:19,600
No!

1250
01:45:28,930 --> 01:45:30,510
Can I still grab this?

1251
01:45:37,990 --> 01:45:39,670
Okay, at least I can still grab it.

1252
01:45:44,450 --> 01:45:47,750
Alright, let's just grab this guy out of the way too.

1253
01:45:49,550 --> 01:45:51,070
I'm gonna grab this guy out of the way.

1254
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:56,410
Put you out here first.

1255
01:45:56,790 --> 01:45:58,050
And then I can grab you.

1256
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:06,310
There we go.

1257
01:46:08,350 --> 01:46:08,830
Oh!

1258
01:46:10,070 --> 01:46:10,630
It's fine.

1259
01:46:10,910 --> 01:46:12,070
We made it.

1260
01:46:14,090 --> 01:46:15,390
There you go.

1261
01:46:18,910 --> 01:46:19,550
Calculator.

1262
01:46:20,010 --> 01:46:20,610
Calculate for this.

1263
01:46:20,690 --> 01:46:21,410
I'm not calculating.

1264
01:46:23,390 --> 01:46:24,950
I'm eating my bagel.

1265
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:26,450
You guys calculated for me.

1266
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:38,060
One, one.

1267
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:40,100
Thanks.

1268
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:43,300
I don't

1269
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:51,600
know.

1270
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:57,800
Oh my god.

1271
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:01,680
No fucking way.

1272
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:04,300
What year is this?

1273
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:06,760
What fucking year?

1274
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,200
Oh my god, not these fuckers.

1275
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:15,580
I was so bad at them.

1276
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:17,460
No way.

1277
01:47:18,820 --> 01:47:23,540
I was so bad at these.

1278
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,420
Oh.

1279
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,180
One of them will hit, right?

1280
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,740
One of them.

1281
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:39,960
Oh my god, this one's stuck.

1282
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:45,300
Oh, guys, this is not looking so good.

1283
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:46,640
One of them is actually stuck.

1284
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:53,330
Oh my god, that's fine.

1285
01:47:53,450 --> 01:47:54,450
That works out.

1286
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:07,980
It's okay.

1287
01:48:10,180 --> 01:48:11,020
It's okay.

1288
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:12,840
It's fine.

1289
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,160
It's absolutely fine.

1290
01:48:21,190 --> 01:48:23,370
It's absolutely fine.

1291
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:29,940
Down?

1292
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:32,780
Oh, there you are.

1293
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:35,900
There you

1294
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:40,480
are.

1295
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:41,240
There you go.

1296
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:42,740
Slow and steady.

1297
01:48:43,460 --> 01:48:44,720
Slow and steady.

1298
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:46,640
Wins the race.

1299
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:48,880
Slow and steady.

1300
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:49,440
Agreed.

1301
01:48:54,090 --> 01:48:54,650
Oh, okay.

1302
01:48:56,730 --> 01:48:56,910
Okay.

1303
01:48:59,170 --> 01:48:59,750
Yes?

1304
01:49:00,990 --> 01:49:02,710
Did you really read to the end?

1305
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:04,730
Assuming that you read to that, don't lie.

1306
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:08,250
Yes, yes, yes.

1307
01:49:10,970 --> 01:49:11,370
No.

1308
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:13,990
Yes, yes.

1309
01:49:15,310 --> 01:49:17,330
So this counts at your agreement, right?

1310
01:49:17,730 --> 01:49:18,030
Yes.

1311
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:20,450
What?

1312
01:49:21,990 --> 01:49:23,070
Oh, no.

1313
01:49:24,110 --> 01:49:24,910
Oh, no.

1314
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:27,230
Here you go.

1315
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:29,150
Oh, it's fine.

1316
01:49:29,170 --> 01:49:41,370
Faster I swear to God if this is one life just like Toho, I
swear to God if this is just like Toho I swear to fucking

1317
01:49:41,370 --> 01:49:51,020
God Okay, here we go fine.

1318
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:52,320
I agree

1319
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:57,360
Where is he?

1320
01:49:58,580 --> 01:49:59,520
Where did he go?

1321
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,400
It's right there, Toki.

1322
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:06,820
Here.

1323
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:08,320
Right there.

1324
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:12,220
He's right there.

1325
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:13,600
Don't you see him?

1326
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,920
I found him.

1327
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:20,780
I found him.

1328
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:22,740
Oh, my God.

1329
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:23,180
Okay.

1330
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:25,460
We gotta build a foundation.

1331
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:30,880
Okay.

1332
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:33,460
This is not a very structural foundation.

1333
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:35,320
But...

1334
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:40,340
Okay, we start our foundation now.

1335
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:46,240
Okay, we start our foundation now.

1336
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:47,820
Oh, God.

1337
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:48,960
Oh, God.

1338
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:51,060
I'll just put him here.

1339
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:53,020
I'll just put him here.

1340
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:06,220
This does not look very secure.

1341
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:08,540
Okay, it's fine.

1342
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:20,420
God!

1343
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:31,980

1346
01:52:12,970 --> 01:52:14,050
This is hell.

1347
01:52:14,590 --> 01:52:15,050
This.

1348
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:17,070
This is hell.

1349
01:52:19,690 --> 01:52:21,530
This is hell right now.

1350
01:52:21,910 --> 01:52:22,470
I'm in it.

1351
01:52:22,790 --> 01:52:23,210
It's not even hell.

1352
01:52:23,390 --> 01:52:24,070
This is purgatory.

1353
01:52:24,730 --> 01:52:28,050
We can't get out of purgatory until we agree to terms of
service.

1354
01:52:29,670 --> 01:52:31,550
What the fuck is this?

1355
01:52:33,050 --> 01:52:34,110
Lefty Lucy?

1356
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:51,600
What does this?

1357
01:52:53,020 --> 01:52:53,700
Okay.

1358
01:52:54,420 --> 01:53:01,500
X equals alphabet number zero.

1359
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:02,460
Okay.

1360
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:08,940
If it's alphabet, alphabet alphabet, alphabet, number, X.

1361
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:09,680
Okay.

1362
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:11,320
X equals, okay.

1363
01:53:12,340 --> 01:53:13,760
Model ID number.

01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:20,620

1391
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:22,600

It fucking touched my toe.

1395

It was right there.

1396
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:43,480
My toe was touched.

1397
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:46,040
And then it was over.

1398
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:49,280
It truly was over.

1399
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:56,410
I'm so sad.

1400
01:56:56,950 --> 01:56:58,110
It was literally right there.
