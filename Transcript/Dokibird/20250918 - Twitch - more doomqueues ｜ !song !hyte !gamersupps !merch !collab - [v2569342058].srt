1
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,780
Hello, hello!

2
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,740
The Duchess of Sealand!

3
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,760
Grace is you, my humble dragoons, with her presence.

4
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,780
What an honor!

5
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,860
Please, please hold the applause.

6
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,820
Hello, everybody.

7
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,640
Hello, hello.

8
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:09,760
Now some of you guys are wondering, why the fuck is she streaming at 1249 a.m.

9
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,900
Marvel Rivals Rick.

10
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,420
Well, I made a little oopsie.

11
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,240
And I.

12
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,920
Glory to the Duchess.

13
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,160
Yes.

14
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,600
Glory be to me.

15
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,020
Glory.

16
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,480
And her trusty knight.

17
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,040
Sir Doki Amber Doge.

18
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,960
Biz, thank you for tier one stuff.

19
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,220
Thank you.

20
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:30,540
Thank you.

21
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:30,900
Utah.

22
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,020
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

23
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,320
Thank you.

24
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,080
So I fucked up a little.

25
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,160
But I made a little oopsie.

26
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,640
But right after the stream.

27
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,140
I may or may not.

28
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,320
Have napped for five to six hours.

29
00:04:41,340 --> 00:05:11,780
hours so so here we are and i i don't know i was just i was really craving for some rank today and i was like you know what it's a playoff stream maybe i'll just stream it i'm not very i won't be like super duper high energy today because it is 12 49 in the morning i did take a nap but in a way where i did mess up my sleep schedule so um so my meant like mentally i might not be there but physically Mentally,

30
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,620
maybe not so much, but we're here anyway.

31
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,740
But yeah, we're just going to be...

32
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,340
Maybe we'll do something else after.

33
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:19,980
I mean, it's Twitch.

34
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,360
I can do whatever fuck I want on Twitch.

35
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,240
It's a gorilla stream on Twitch.

36
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,320
Maybe I'll bounce around a couple other things.

37
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,060
But for now, I am craving some Doom Q.

38
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,440
Because what a way to start my day again.

39
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,560
Because technically, I didn't start my day.

40
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,940
Technically, I didn't even start my day.

41
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,320
Because what I did today, I woke up streaming.

42
00:05:41,340 --> 00:06:12,520
and then i fell back asleep so what a great way to start my day by some doom cue to make myself feel even more shit let's go uh if i let's go you know i feel good about myself and today i just want to ruin it you know i just i just want to ruin this feeling i'm like i don't me feeling good today that seems wrong i don't like it i want some doom in my life all right let's queue up uh Let's just go straight in.

43
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,120
Fuck it.

44
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,800
Bump, bump, bump, bump.

45
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,480
Bump, bump.

46
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,680
Remember when yesterday Doki was going to be like, this is going to be productive Wii for me.

47
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,100
I'm going to be so productive.

48
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,200
And here I am.

49
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,560
Here I am playing some Marvel Rivalist at 1251 a.m.

50
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,720
And I know that Dad is going to wake me up in technically.

51
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,040
If you think about it, he can't wake me up if I'm already awake.

52
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,740
What if that's my solution?

53
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,280
They can't wake me up if I'm already awake.

54
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,940
And then after that, then I can have a good sleep after that.

55
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,080
Uh, Carol, thank you for the hundred biddies.

56
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,900
Thank you, thank you.

57
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,600
Hey, Doki, sorry I can't send any more Supas on YouTube.

58
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,040
After buying both the night and knife and pajama.

59
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,640
It's all right.

60
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,140
Thank you for the support, though, Kyle.

61
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,620
I do appreciate it so much.

62
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,780
So I'm dipping into my bits.

63
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,280
I vowed my allegiance to Duchess Doki.

64
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,720
Thank you for the super chat.

65
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,440
Thank you, thank you.

66
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,340
Yes, it is I.

67
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,600
Duchess of Sea Land.

68
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,640
Please, Neal.

69
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,300
No, no, please.

70
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,180
Neal before me.

71
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,660
You are in the presence of royalty now.

72
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,580
Oh, yeah.

73
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,480
So I also updated all my emotes.

74
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,000
And you might see I updated my panels as well.

75
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:32,840
So, yay.

76
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,620
My Twitch is a little prettier now.

77
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,100
I hope you guys enjoyed all the...

78
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,360
Well, they're not new emotes.

79
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,040
They're technically old emotes.

80
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,860
But I hope you guys enjoyed.

81
00:07:44,340 --> 00:08:15,280
finally having my updated emotes on Twitch yeah finally maybe I should go to doom queue I'm doom queuing so I might as well go to doom match oh I can go meet the roleplayers alright what is it who slaps oh wait Emma slaps right where's Emma hello I'm ready to roleplay no that's not I thought she slapped I guess her...

82
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,620
I thought she slaps.

83
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,340
I forgot what her melee was.

84
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,740
I thought that was her slapping.

85
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:25,530
Alright.

86
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:31,370
I don't think I'm gonna have people that I know in these games because I'm pretty low right now.

87
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,950
I mean, the season just started everybody's low, but I think all the good players already are like GM Celestia already.

88
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,050
Uh...

89
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:41,750
Fuck it.

90
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,790
I'll play what I'm comfortable.

91
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,850
I've been trying to learn Jeff because he's meta now, and it's not going okay.

92
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,870
Why do they keep making all these characters that don't play meta?

93
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,330
I always have to learn a new character every season.

94
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,130
I was like, there's no way they'll ever, I was like, there's no way they'll ever buff Jeff.

95
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,190
I'll never have to learn him.

96
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,110
And then they buffed Jeff, and now I have to learn how to play him.

97
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,740
I'm going, guys, guys, I can't.

98
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,880
I really hate this.

99
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,920
I don't like the color.

100
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:14,900
skin.

101
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,360
I know.

102
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,880
I told you guys, I never liked any of the Luna skin.

103
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,060
Okay, I'll think of the bitties.

104
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:27,460
Thank you.

105
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,160
Thank you.

106
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,980
Oh, you know what skins I'm looking for?

107
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,200
I actually really like the newest summer skins.

108
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,620
I'm so, like, Matt, okay, I think we all know.

109
00:09:40,700 --> 00:10:08,640
Like, this isn't like, this isn't like a hot take, but Matt, this is new summer skin is hot as fuck we cannot deny that's a good summer skin that's a good one like get up move over luna snow and your t-mood swimsuit that's that's a classy bitch right there that That new mantis,

110
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,540
um, That, like, Luna, who?

111
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:19,820
But yeah, no, the new mantis's, um, Um, summer skin is so good.

112
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,660
I love it so much.

113
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,320
Also, the, the, um, invisible women one, too.

114
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,200
I think the invisible women one is also a really good summer skin.

115
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,240
God, I wish Luna can have the same treatment.

116
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,480
Oh, you're fools.

117
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,160
Thank you about 10 gifted subs.

118
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,560
Thank you.

119
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,200
Thank you.

120
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,360
I really appreciate it.

121
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,300
Thank you so much.

122
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,420
All right, here we go.

123
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,460
I didn't warm up at all, but that's okay.

124
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,740
What are my frames right now?

125
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,420
All right.

126
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,940
Yeah, that's a class.

127
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,220
Yeah, that's a classy bitch right there.

128
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,860
You know, you know, she shops at the luxury districts right there.

129
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,180
She doesn't shop at Sheen like Luna Snow.

130
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,080
What the fuck?

131
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:34,460
the penny the penny bug i was like how the did he get a kill already oh i wouldn't i guess i'll do it on starlord technically i should play invisible woman because she is meta now technically because her her new kid is so strong oh man that's unlucky

132
00:11:38,880 --> 00:12:34,120
it i don't know what's going on but we're doing it let's go also recently um i played a little bit of overwatch a few days ago and rival spoiled me so much playing support because hold i feel like i feel like as a support and overwatch your impact in the game is so like i feel like okay i'm barely doing any healing at all and also my ult feels so fucking slow i i got spoiled so hard playing support on rivals yeah i feel like when i'm healing someone i feel like i'm just not healing i was like just get a health pack and just getting a health pack seems much more reliable than my own healing it does it feels like it does more healing but overwatch health pack then than anything

133
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:46,260
Oh my god, I'm so greedy Technically I could damage I could oh

134
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:55,460
I did not realize That was not our feet.

135
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,880
Sorry, I zoned out.

136
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:06,960
I Thought that was I thought that was our Phoenix all right That's my bet I was just like oh look there's my Phoenix right there I

137
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,120
Okay, I forgot Phoenix's alt line.

138
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,400
I legitimately forgot what his fucking enemy alt line was.

139
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,280
My brain is not there, right?

140
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,300
I told you, my mentally, I'm not.

141
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,320
All right, guys, what was Phoenix's enemy alt line?

142
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,540
And what is Phoenix's ally alt line?

143
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,700
That's fine.

144
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,820
I'm saving it for this here.

145
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,280
This is fine.

146
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,560
There you go.

147
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,700
See, it was fine.

148
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,220
I just literally watched myself die.

149
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,180
The thing is, that was so easily avoidable too.

150
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,720
That's the worst part.

151
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,400
I like this.

152
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:53,680
Okay.

153
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:54,840
There we go.

154
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,040
I want that extra HP.

155
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,520
I saw that bubble and I was like, I'll be...

156
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,020
Again?

157
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,620
Oh, no.

158
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
This is bad.

159
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,200
This is bad.

160
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,400
We gotta save each other.

161
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,480
This is so bad.

162
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:08,820
There we go.

163
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,640
This is so bad.

164
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,460
This is so pissed off.

165
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,480
This is not bad anymore.

166
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,920
It's not bad anymore.

167
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,320
How did he get it again?

168
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,780
Oh, it's alright.

169
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,380
I'll just be slapped into the cloak.

170
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,820
Oh, this is fine.

171
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,680
I'll still be slapped into the cloak.

172
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,080
Please stop!

173
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,400
Please.

174
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,760
Please, I beg you, stop.

175
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,640
Okay, maybe I did low-key throw a little bit earlier.

176
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,540
But it's okay.

177
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,040
It's nearly my first game, so it should be okay, right?

178
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,080
Like, I have...

179
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,180
Okay, I need...

180
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,180
I am trying my best to keep my team up.

181
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,300
Oh my god, how is he... stop!

182
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,920
Stop!

183
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,040
Okay, there we go.

184
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,260
All right, that's fine.

185
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,140
It's okay.

186
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:19,540
I get three game buffer exactly I'm allowed to be held empty for three games Yeah, I'm just a heal bot.

187
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,400
Let's go Jesus Christ.

188
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:23,660
Oh my god.

189
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:23,820
Okay.

190
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Okay.

191
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,260
I did say I'm a heal bot, but that doesn't mean for you.

192
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:35,940
Okay, Jesus Christ Please please please no Cloak you're supposed to keep me up How did you not keep me up?

193
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,560
I don't understand You had one job!

194
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,240
Okay, it's fine.

195
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,220
There was nothing I could do.

196
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,140
There was actually nothing.

197
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,840
Okay, um...

198
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,880
Um...

199
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,860
Alright, let's... Maybe...

200
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,720
Maybe I can touch.

201
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,020
Nope.

202
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,600
There was no- I don't know what else I could do!

203
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,700
I was just hoping that my cloak would...

204
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,420
would heal me through all of that.

205
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,200
I demand my heals.

206
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,860
Music makes people happy.

207
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:41,460
No, I know I can kill the Phoenix, but also like I'm hoping that other people would do that All right, that's fine You are nothing is the Phoenix enemy Oh, I literally forgot what the enemy Phoenix Oh, what line was I just felt it just felt so you know when she's like you are nothing I think I can say When he says like you are nothing when she says like you are nothing I was like that sounds so friendly I was like,

208
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,740
well, that sounds so friendly.

209
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,820
That should be my, that's my team's all, right?

210
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:48,560
Like,

211
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,200
that sounds like a friendly, friendly Phoenix, all.

212
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:08,080
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, we kidnapped and didn't do anything.

00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,340
Yeah!

216
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,040
That's fine.

217
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,240
First game.

218
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,120
First game.

219
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,760
I was not going to...

220
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,880
First game, guys.

221
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,820
This was first game.

222
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,100
First game was not meant to be a good game.

223
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,920
It's a warm-up, guys.

224
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,560
It's a warm-up.

225
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,120
First game is always warm-up.

226
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,840
I should have saved my clap.

227
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:10,600
Oh, well.

228
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,300
It's fine.

229
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,020
That's okay.

230
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,080
Everything is fine.

231
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,860
Everything is so fine.

232
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,660
Just because that...

233
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,300
I think I can...

234
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,860
Okay, never mind.

235
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,460
I could save most of them.

236
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,880
I saved most...

237
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,320
No!

238
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,500
You could have fucking waited for my death!

239
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,160
Oh my god.

240
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,440
Oh, this is fine.

241
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,980
I felt like my damage boost...

242
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,200
Oh.

243
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,200
He could have waited for my damage boost.

244
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,880
Yeah, no, this was...

245
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,120
Might be a little...

246
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,040
Look, I made one mistake.

247
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,140
The rest is not my fault.

248
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,740
I only made one oopsie in that game, guys.

249
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,160
The rest is not my fault.

250
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,540
The rest is a team effort at that point.

251
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,320
It was...

252
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,220
It was...

253
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,660
You have a whole tree.

254
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,820
Okay.

255
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:12,720
Jesus, Chris.

256
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,040
How are they building guys?

257
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:14,460
Please.

258
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,760
Shoot the squid.

259
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:16,620
Please.

260
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,420
Oh my god.

261
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,800
My poor, my poor Invis.

262
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,020
My poor Invis.

263
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,500
Oh shit.

264
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,600
One mistake.

265
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,480
I made one mistake.

266
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,560
It can't all be me.

267
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,080
It requires this is a team game.

268
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,440
This is a this is a team game

269
00:19:48,380 --> 00:20:05,580
No, it did not got it cost it the round not it cost the round not the entire game Maybe just one around So I'm the I'm it's early season I can climb back again

270
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:20,600
Look, maybe my one mistake costed us that one round, but that doesn't mean the entire game was on my side, was my fault.

271
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:29,480
I may have, I may have confused the Phoenix Alt to RT, and I just stood there.

272
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:38,860
I might have, because I was like, why is, because like, to be fair, the Phoenix Alt was on our side.

273
00:20:38,880 --> 00:21:10,200
side so of course i thought it was my team's phoenix all i was like what the fuck what the fuck is that phoenix all doing there but now i know guys now i know it's different now i figured it out oh okay i got a game it sounded so friendly the way he said it When he was like,

274
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,600
you are nothing.

275
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,800
I was like, aww, you don't mean that.

276
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,920
Thanks, you're so silly.

277
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,580
You're so silly.

278
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,000
Oh, he's just, he's just joking.

279
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,180
That's just how we bros joke, you know?

280
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,440
That's what we say to each.

281
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,800
He's like, you just, just like little banty.

282
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,200
Like when I call someone a bitch, like, oh, you're such a bitch.

283
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:33,940
You're nothing.

284
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,500
Such a sweet thing to say.

285
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,000
That's what we know we type like that, you know?

286
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,420
That's what I know.

287
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,400
Like, she and I, we type like that.

288
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,760
I still don't even know what my friendly Phoenix ult is.

289
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,980
What she says.

290
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,880
Like, what does a friendly Phoenix ult says?

291
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,680
It's what friends do.

292
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,900
Oh, I am Phoenix.

293
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,320
Now, that sounds much more.

294
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,000
That sounds much more threatening.

295
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,380
Because she's like, I'm Phoenix.

296
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,400
I feel more threatened Wednesday she says that.

297
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,120
Like, why are you telling me your name?

298
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,680
Like, am I supposed to...

299
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,600
Like, why are you reminding...

300
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,200
That's so passive-aggressive, you know?

301
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,700
Like, she's just trying to...

302
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,880
Oh, we didn't bat anything.

303
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,460
Because why is she being so passive-aggressive and telling me her name?

304
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,500
Like, bitch, you think I forgot your name?

305
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,180
Like, I know what your name is.

306
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,080
Alright, um, I don't know.

307
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,140
I guess I'll play Invis.

308
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,280
I feel like I won't play Invis right now.

309
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,180
Yeah, no friend will say their name to me.

310
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,380
I already know.

311
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,940
That's the thing.

312
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,740
I like her.

313
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,640
I like her fantastic foreskin.

314
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,120
Because I like the hairstyle.

315
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,820
I think the hairstyle is really cute.

316
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:43,310
I think her hairstyle is really really cute and I like it and like it accentuates important things yeah I think the skin is cute like look at this look at this when I when I move you know what look at that you see something like pop out a little bit more when I'm jumping and it's very fantastic.

317
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,630
Guys, I did not say today's a climbing day.

318
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,470
Oh my god, say something, girl.

319
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:09,050
The only reason I knew you were low in HP was when your fucking character was like, ooh, owey.

320
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,250
Okay.

321
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,330
Bro, say something when you're low.

322
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,530
I don't want to look at you 24-7.

323
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,290
I have to look in front of me.

324
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,870
Okay, you better be healing the strange, though.

325
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,610
Oh, no, that's bad.

326
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,210
This is bad.

327
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,130
This is bad.

328
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:28,850
Nice.

329
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,930
Oh, now you say something.

330
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,990
And when you're full-age, oh, that's bad.

331
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,270
That's a little bad, though.

332
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,290
That's fine.

333
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,370
level up too.

334
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,610
That's fine.

335
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,750
I mean, technically, do I do it?

336
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:49,640
I could do it.

337
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,190
I could just up.

338
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,650
Technically.

339
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,110
It would be a waste.

340
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,670
Okay, we gotta...

341
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,350
Okay, we gotta go.

342
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,230
We gotta push forward, guys.

343
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,980
Oh, this is bad.

344
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,760
I'm just gonna use this.

345
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,120
Oh, this is very bad.

346
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,240
It's very bad.

347
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,180
The moment I heard the eye, I was like, it's over.

348
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,600
It's over.

349
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,460
I knew she had ult, too.

350
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,620
I just didn't think he was going to...

351
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,120
I didn't think I was going to see three fucking alts at once.

352
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:32,840
Really?

353
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,020
We didn't use anything except for my ult?

354
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,560
Yeah, no.

355
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,000
The only way to survive that is...

356
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,020
Literally, I saved my...

357
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,980
Literally, I didn't alt right away, and I saved my play.

358
00:25:46,000 --> 00:26:13,420
but like I did not think they were gonna throw three alts there I knew he had change up but I I don't know I didn't think he was gonna fucking I was gonna see like three fucking alts there and the fact that was it was a damage boost too with the raccoon up we're so passive we're so fucking passive I don't know maybe I'm pushing something over

359
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,360
Honestly, this team is very passive in general.

360
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,200
Oh!

361
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,160
I'm dead.

362
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,160
Unless... Oh, never mind.

363
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,940
Like, we still have our...

364
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,440
We still have our Starlord oil.

365
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,780
And we're not pushing up.

366
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,180
My team is scared.

367
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,420
They're little babies.

368
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,440
Why are you so scared for?

369
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,980

I don't know what happened, but I'm alive.

380
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:25,900
I have to reload.

381
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,460
I have to reload.

382
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,420
I have to reload.

383
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,920
Please, I'm putting everything I got into you.

384
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,880
I'm actually putting everything I got into you.

385
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,140
Oh, my.

386
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,140
I'm sorry, Rocket, but good luck.

387
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,080
I need to heal my things first.

388
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,900
This is fine.

389
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,580
This is fine.

390
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,430
but this is fine.

391
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,760
It's not.

392
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,280
I had to use that.

393
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,280
I don't understand.

394
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,540
Why do they get Bubbles?

395
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,160
That's such a crazy concept for my team apparently.

396
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:14,920
Oh my god.

397
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:15,780
Oh my god.

398
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,640
I hope he lives.

399
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,100
I hope he lives in there.

400
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,360
All I'm saying is like, I hope it's so hard when we don't have any bubbles.

401
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,380
Who's over there?

402
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:42,250
Oh my gosh, I thought he would dash away, but he said he was like, you know what, fuck it.

403
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,310
Fuck this low-key clone, too.

404
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,470
I'm so scared.

405
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,010
I know he's gonna do it.

406
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,790
I know that strange is gonna do it.

407
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,670
That's the worst part.

408
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,710
I can tell He wants to.

409
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:27,430
He wants to so bad He wants to so bad at all right now Oh my It's fine It's okay It's okay everything is fine We didn't see that guys I live though I live Guys I live guys I live It's fine I live.

410
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:33,730
I'm going into spider mode.

411
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,930
Guys, it was so close.

412
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,590
You don't understand.

413
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,170
His hitbox was just a little bit.

414
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,830
It was just a little bit.

415
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,730
There we go.

416
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,950
We did it, guys.

417
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,090
We did it.

418
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:01,190
it's okay everything worked out

419
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:07,910
everything worked out in the end guys

420
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:34,640
i like the new summer skins i like that the i like that the punisher skin um his gun is a nerf gun like i don't think i saw the trailer for it and because like the sound okay I normally don't like the sound effects for For the guns because it's like a bit distracting for me,

421
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:40,120
but I really I really like the Punisher sound effects for it Yeah, it's so silly.

422
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,460
It makes like it's like a nerf.

423
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,740
Is that super soak or a nerf?

424
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:51,740
It looks like a combination between a nerf gun and a super soak here Also, he's wearing a thong, but that's not that that's not that important

425
00:32:54,820 --> 00:33:28,920
That's not as important okay as the but no i like all i also like how the thing got to it's like wow thing why did why did mom give you two summer skins the fact that the thing got two and then like johnny like the torches emo is him in a fucking it's like a like an internal sensory deprivation water tank or some shit it's so weird this fucking little water tank thingy Oh,

426
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,160
we're doing the Angela again, guys.

427
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,300
We're trying it again.

428
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,120
Oh, I'm solo healing, too.

429
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,760
That's fine.

430
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,200
Might not be as fine.

431
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,160
I don't know now.

432
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,400
It might not be as fine solo healing this.

433
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,600
I need to use my own thing as a heal.

434
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,600
Okay, now I don't need a solo heal.

435
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,000
Thank God.

436
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,400
I was going to say, I don't know if I feel good about the solo heal.

437
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,740
Okay, I don't hope that

438
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:29,660
All right, it's fine No time, we're just slowly breaching through Okay, never mind, never mind It's not as good anymore It's not fine anymore It's fine again, it's fine again We're so back again Watch this Oh shit, oh shit, everybody Okay, I was gonna see how I could push in I live,

439
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:29,920
though.

440
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,320
I live.

441
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,640
We're watching.

442
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,440
We're watching.

443
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,000
There we go.

444
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,380
I wanted to see if I could, I could, you know, push in.

445
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,360
I mean, use the rocket ult for judgment.

446
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,040
Not mine.

447
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,020
You get more mobility for that, yeah.

448
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,000
Jesus.

449
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,500
Oh my god, he's not like...

450
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,460
Okay, I don't think I was...

451
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,000
I don't think me alting would have saved us.

452
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,020
I had to wait.

453
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,060
Oh, okay, Angela.

454
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,160
Goodbye, Angela.

455
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,960
I mean, you flew away from my shield.

456
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,060
Is it really my fault?

457
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,160
It's fine.

458
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,420
We're just warming up.

459
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,120
It's a warm-up until we win.

460
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,700
I just don't think Angela's the pick right now.

461
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,320
Maybe.

462
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,540
Oh my god, I can feel it.

463
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,260
I know he's here.

464
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,920
I know he's waiting.

465
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,240
I used my push.

466
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:45,960
Just in case.

467
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,080
I knew it.

468
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,600
I knew it.

469
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,820
I figured that I would live through this.

470
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:50,500
I...

471
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,620
I knew it was going to happen, but I was thinking I'll live through it, right?

472
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,800
I knew it was gonna happen.

473
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,200
I just believed in me staying alive.

474
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,120
But my team's died.

475
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,860
My team's still died.

476
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,780
I don't know.

477
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:18,140
I was like, I know he has it and I used my push already.

478
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,280
So like, I'm gonna risk it.

479
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,860
There was definitely not four people that that fight.

480
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,200
Thanks so much.

481
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:57,680
i could have saved it for the bucky up i just fell a little burky there wait they have ultron no oh no it's just this map i was like what it's fine they might have you know they may have oh my god what there you go jesus christ guys i need you guys to deal with like all the people up there

482
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:05,550
Are you still fighting that one phoenix?

483
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,470
Okay, nice.

484
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,210
Look, I did it!

485
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,150
I did it!

486
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,160
Holy shit, he was not living that.

487
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,780
It's a moral victory.

488
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,580
It's a moral victory.

489
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,520
That's why I got the push.

490
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,020
I got the push that matters.

491
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,080
1 out of 4

492
00:37:45,340 --> 00:38:35,440
to be fair one of our tanks decided to fucking play Angela to be fair it was it would have been really winnable if our other tank did not go Angela and we actually had a shield tank we had no shield tank so like I feel like Angela's not that good I don't know Angela doesn't seem that strong Um Doesn't seem that strong unless you have a mag No she is She has a very high skill ceiling It's very hard to get good at Angela But also I personally feel like She's like She needs a team Yeah She needs a team to be effective

493
00:38:38,780 --> 00:39:42,780
That's how I honestly feel um yeah invis can counter Angela like and because like all i have to do is just push her that's really all I have to do as long as I push the angela but like to be fair like the thing is I gotta hit my pushes too though to be fair push her pull it gotta be push her pull the angela and then and then then you can counter same with what like that's basically the wolf think she's not that strong especially in this fucking elo too very the season just reset itself so like everyone's like in diamond well all the really good players are like the pros are in gm celestial now um but i honestly personally think she's only good in maybe good in a scrim environment like in the tournament environment but fucking ass in rank because you now have a really coordinated team to be able to play angela correctly It's very specific,

494
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:43,980
yeah.

495
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,300
Wait, I want to be...

496
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,360
Oh, wait, I want to be Jeff.

497
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,040
Alright.

498
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,160

499
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,560
Hello, my fellow roleplayers.

500
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,580
Hello, I can't wait for rivals to do custom zombies.

501

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,800
Guys, I'm literally here to slap.

510
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,180
Where are my venoms?

511
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,280
My row of venoms.

512
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,580
What's the point?

513
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,040

00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,090
Honey, where are my twerkers?

515
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:13,990
I don't want to play right now.

516
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:14,810
Jeff.

517
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,390
I might be an IloTERRAS today.

518
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:23,350
I just want to have a good time.

519
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,810
I barely played Jeff.

520
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,150
I feel like an IloTERRAS today.

521
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,510
I just feel extra quirky.

522
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:42,130
You see, Jeff is actually really strong, but...

523
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:42,990
Yeah, GG.

524
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,270
I'll be spawned.

525
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:44,810
What the fuck?

526
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:45,550
Who's already?

527
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,870
Why are they already throwing?

528
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:47,450
Why?

529
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,590
This is my third game.

530
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:57,630
Okay, I feel like all my games right now are pretty, pretty bad.

531
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,010
The game hasn't even started.

532
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,570
What the fuck do you mean?

533
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,230
Who the fuck uses Iron Fist?

534
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,150
What Elo are you?

535
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,550
You think he's the ELO terrorist?

536
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,750
Oh, someone's using a third party.

537
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,990
Someone using a third party.

538
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,540
I don't know who uses third party.

539
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:37,540
I don't know what third party app they use, but like, some people use third party apps where...

540
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,160
What the fuck?

541
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,780

544
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:01,660

BP is so good.

568
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:54,090
What the fuck is wrong with him?

569
00:43:55,850 --> 00:44:23,190

578
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:57,790
We can report him.

579
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,050

580
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:04,950

Oh, get surrounded.

583
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:10,890
No!

584
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,830
You can't pre-make...

585
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:16,750
Can you pre-made diamond?

586
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:17,650

00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:22,330
Maximum three star now That's it.

588
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:23,290
That's it.

589
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:46,410
It's over That's fine God is punishing me for playing Jeff, you know, he doesn't deserve healing They're just punishing me for trying to play Jeff Because I decided that I wanted to play Jeff That's fine

590
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,850
It's fine.

591
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:53,010
If you're punishing me.

592
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,630
They knew what I wanted to do.

593
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:04,290
What is that?

594
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:04,710
What?

595
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:05,230
Okay.

596
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:06,050
That's fine.

597
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:07,490
Goodbye.

598
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:10,390
They knew.

599
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:13,070
They knew.

600
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:19,650
They punished me for trying to have fun.

601
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:21,410
Does they do?

602
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:26,710
I just need to drag someone else to doom queue with me.

603
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:27,750
That's the only strat.

604
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:35,590
I need someone else to... Now, I can't... Not only can I lose Elo, I want someone else to lose Elo with me.

605
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:38,470
It's the only way.

606
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,350
It truly is.

607
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,410
Why are you all walking away?

608
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,650
There's three people on foot.

609
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,650
God is truly punishing me.

610
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:48,070
me.

611
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:52,270
I don't have jetball yet.

612
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:57,850
I gotta, I gotta do a trio with, do a trio with someone and make them suffer.

613
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:00,030
I can't just do this myself.

614
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,250
I can't just suffer by myself.

615
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,990
I need to take someone down with me.

616
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,970
It's the only way.

617
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:10,750
It truly is the only way.

618
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:17,650
Oh no, he's fucking dead.

619
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:18,270
Dead.

620
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:19,570
Oh,

621
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,080
man, I couldn't do anything.

622
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,040
I wanted it up, but I was like, no.

623
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,400
There's nothing I can do.

624
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,640
It's not fair.

625
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,280
Exactly.

626
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,340
I shouldn't be the only one to suffer.

627
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,380
I need to remember that this is not...

628
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,760
I think this could be winnable.

629
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,220
Am I coping?

630
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,380
It's not cope, right?

631
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,520
This is technically...

632
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,520
It's fine.

633
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,440
Okay.

634
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:16,180
Guys, there is a bucky right here, guys.

635
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:22,500
Okay, I was gonna say, you better kill that bucky that I threw behind us in every...

636
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:51,830

637
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:55,590
Nice.

638
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:58,710
Cleave time, cleave.

639
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:00,550
Oh, that's unlucky.

640
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:03,270
Cleave time, cleave time.

641
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:05,430
Cleave time.

642
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:06,970
They're all standing in the line.

643
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:09,070
Oh, nope.

644
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:10,970
This is a little bad.

645
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:12,090
That's okay.

646
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,050
This is a little bad still, but that's okay.

647
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:14,690
We got him.

648
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:16,210
I said a little.

649
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:16,890
It's fine.

650
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:20,870
See, guys?

651
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:21,950
It's not him.

652
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:23,030
Two minutes.

653
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,150
He's got to do it for two minutes.

654
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:24,810
more minutes.

655
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,510
Okay, I could have, I should have swapped off.

656
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:30,910
I, I didn't really swap off.

657
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:34,970
I didn't realize this is going to be a rough game.

658
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:39,150
I just, just wanted to play Jeff.

659
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:42,290
That's it.

660
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,670
Okay, I need to wait for her to use fade.

661
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:46,250
That's literally all I have to do.

662
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,620
Oh my god, oh my, it's, oh my time team still died.

663
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,200
I got two people away.

664
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:07,380
I,

665
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,720
two people were gone from the fight.

666
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,000
Okay, it's fine.

667
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,520
I literally got rid of two people.

668
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,540
My team still died with that.

669
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:24,660
That's very unlucky.

670
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,780
Judge, jury, executioner.

671
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,280
Clearly not enough.

672
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:45,180
Yeah, they had one less healer, too.

673
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:55,620
I was debating if I should swim to my team or swim, like, just, like, isolate them.

674
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:58,800
There was no point.

675
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,420
There was no point in ice.

676
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:04,800
Like, I felt like if I swam to my team, they'll die even faster.

677
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,100
Jeff is good.

678
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,640
But I...

679
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,540
But...

680
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,960
It doesn't mean I'm good at Jeff, though.

681
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,100
But Jeff is a good pick.

682
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:23,780
But I just may or may not be very good at Jeff.

683
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,660
I think I played Jeff like...

684
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,240
I can show you guys my Jeff hours.

685
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,260
I think I played Jeff less than five hours in the entire time.

686
00:51:31,420 --> 00:52:51,180
uh the entire time this game came out he is no i'm serious he actually is really really good in high elo now he's actually really good right now the battle starts in five four three two i'm serious i'm serious i guess i watched scrims really good now i watched like in pro play and in the high elo rig i swear to god i'm not lying i'm not coping oh i thought i could i swear to god it's not cool please i swear to god and we believe you it just doesn't mean i'm it doesn't mean i'm good at you but i swear to god where they got i'm just may or may not be very good at that character i want to learn how to be good at him i do i actually really want to learn how to be good at jeff because like having a really good jeff actually changes um because in the high elo um there's so many people that play jeff

687
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:08,560
so i really want to oh that's a very unlucky i don't know who we lost I don't even know who we lost.

688
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:15,090
Was that good?

689
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,810
I don't even know.

690
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:18,710
Oh.

691
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:19,830
Oh.

692
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:21,410
Oh.

693
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:21,450
Man.

694
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:22,690
We'll be cool.

695
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:23,230
Whoa.

696
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:25,670
I got soon.

697
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,510
I think our Emma's dead, dead.

698
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:31,850
I don't.

699
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:33,310
Oh my god.

700
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:35,590
He had every resource.

701
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:36,350
pumped into him.

702
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:37,250
I, I don't know.

703
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:38,670
I...

704
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:43,290
We went on a real comp and we're doing worse.

705
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,070
We should have memed in the entire tab.

706
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,820
The fact that we're on a worst comp and we were winning.

707
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,740
Not winning, but we put up a better fight.

708
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,560
Let's get...

709
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,940
Oh my god, I don't have anything.

710
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,120
I have to...

711
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:13,400
I'm trying my best to keep me full of that.

712
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,400
I'm gonna wait until...

713
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,400
I was gonna say, I was trying to wait until...

714
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,480
He's off of diamond for him.

715
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,840
I hope they're not low HP over there.

716
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:24,620
Thank God.

717
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,400
Okay, I was gonna say, I'm not going in there.

718
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:30,460
Okay.

719
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:32,600
Where's that?

720
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,620
Oh, there it is.

721
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,920
I was like, where is that?

722
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,720
Alright, just play in that.

723
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,780
I'll play over here.

724
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,300
I'll play over here.

725
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,920
You guys can play in there, and I'll play...

726
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,960
Okay, yeah, that's... That's cool.

727
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,780
What the fuck?

728
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,780
Guys, it's one guy!

729
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,620
It's one guy!

730
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,360
I don't know.

731
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,220
I don't know, like...

732
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,900
I don't know if they'll rework Jeff again, but like...

733
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,380
A good Jeff is so scary now in the high, though.

734
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:19,100
But it's not about, it's not about, like, flanking anymore.

735
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,100
It's more so of, like, you guys, it's just cleaving the people.

736
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,040
Like, if they're playing, like, super...

737
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:26,700
Oh, my God.

738
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,100
Goodbye.

739
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,220
He's gonna do it.

740
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,760
He's gonna do it.

741
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,820
We don't have anything for it.

742
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:38,800
But it's more so that they're playing Brawl Comp, because you can grab, build alt so fast if they're on Brawl Comp.

743
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,440
fucking dead.

744
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,920
He's so dead.

745
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,660
Blade is still garbage, you know.

746
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,940
His kid is just so bad.

747
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,340
It's just not meta.

748
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,720
That's really it.

749
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,100
He's just not meta.

750
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,140
There's nothing he can do about it.

751
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,540
Oh, nice.

752
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,060
Oh, shit.

753
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:04,740
That's a good shield.

754
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,880
That's a really good shield.

755
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:07,500
Please.

756
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,440
We're putting... Oh, my God.

757
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,000
You...

758
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:23,240

759
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:42,860

760
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,260
Enemy located.

761
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:45,660
Disappear!

762
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:46,820
Enemy located.

763
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,220
Please, please, please, please, please, please.

764
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:50,460
Please, please, please.

765
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,120
Please, please, I'm so scared.

766
00:56:52,520 --> 00:57:03,220
I- Oh my god, don't- Please, why did no one look at them?

767
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,300
I won't disappear so easily.

768
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,400
Oh my god, there's nothing I could do.

769
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,180
There was actually nothing I could do there.

770
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,040
As far as long as our Luna lives, it should be fine.

771
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:18,160
We did it.

772
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,960
There was no way.

773
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,480
I even pinged them.

774
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,230
Okay, I'll let Arluna heal.

775
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:31,450
I don't need this.

776
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:32,030
I'll charge.

777
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:38,940
Alright.

778
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:39,900
I don't really...

779
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,280
I'm just gonna let Arluna heal.

780
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,300
So she can build all the faster.

781
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,260
Because I technically don't need to do this.

782
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:48,880
Okay.

783
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,940
I want to pull the mag over.

784
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:51,880
Nice.

785
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,860
I did my job.

786
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:55,420
Okay.

787
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,100
All right, just making sure Luna doesn't die.

788
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:59,140
That's not well.

789
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,300
I'll make sure they don't die, too That's fine.

790
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:04,560
We'll just we'll just stay here.

791
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:08,720
I guess that Holy shit.

792
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,400
I I don't know what you wanted I

793
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:23,700
Don't know I don't know what our punishers idea was for that I I don't know I did my best.

794
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,420
I really did it

795
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,120
I couldn't walk up then the cloak all was right behind me

796
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:57,860
It was a cloak all that was that Was posted right behind me so I couldn't walk up I was fucked either way because I want to be in there to To be with my Luna So we could pocket each other All right.

797
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,200
I need a selfie.

798
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,200
I don't know why we're still fighting this with four of us.

799
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,380
That's okay.

800
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:08,100
I just...

801
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,520
Oh, that is not okay.

802
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,200
That is...

803
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:11,840
That...

804
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,760
Oh, my God.

805
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:13,460
That is...

806
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,640
Oh, my God.

807
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,580
That was not okay.

808
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,120
Oh, please, please.

809
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,280
You have all...

810
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,140
You have all...

811
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:19,500
Please.

812
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,760
Oh, Luna, please.

813
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,720
Why did you all do the way?

814
00:59:35,060 --> 01:00:06,720
I did think I did think That you know I thought maybe Okay this I don't know What to do I was trying to I don't know why Okay the question is Why did I Strange make this portal There Oh Oh That's my question.

815
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:12,840
I would like to know why he made the portal there.

816
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,150
That is...

817
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:19,920
I...

818
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,860
I am a little confused.

819
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,440
I'm just...

820
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:28,060
Just a little bit confused at that portal, you know?

821
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:29,940
Like, is that...

822
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,180
You know...

823
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:33,940
Is that justifiable to be a little...

824
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,100
confused with that one

825
01:00:43,650 --> 01:01:11,070
I'm just gonna use this for now I don't want to be next to them this is the final effort okay I'm not putting any I didn't put any clones sorry I have one clone the fact that like our Strange.

826
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:12,590
Put the puerto.

827
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:15,710
Like, I don't know.

828
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:17,550
It was so close to them.

829
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:23,510
He did not have to go that further into the team.

830
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:25,730
That confused me as well.

831
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,550
I was so very confused.

832
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:32,910
What the fuck is this guy?

833
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:33,350
Anyway.

834
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:35,050
It's okay.

835
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:36,090
It's still warm up.

836
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:36,830
It's so...

837
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:37,670
I just got...

838
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:39,950
Maybe I can drag someone down.

839
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:45,530
What was it?

840
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:46,850
Negative behavior.

841
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:48,490
Throwing.

842
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:52,350
Try the.

843
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:55,570
Was throwing in the first half.

844
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:58,070
There you go.

845
01:01:58,750 --> 01:01:59,230
And then.

846
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:02,170
And also was an angie baby.

847
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:12,960
That was.

848
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,520
That was very interesting.

849
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,080
Is anyone online?

850
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:22,280
I don't know.

851
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,540
Oh, I'm too low, I think.

852
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:25,800
I don't know.

853
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,880
I don't know what the...

854
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,820
I think it's...

855
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:30,680
Uh...

856
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,040
I think it's like...

857
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:33,240
Plus...

858
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,240
Is it one whole tier?

859
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,220
I don't remember.

860
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:37,700
Honestly.

861
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:42,060
I don't remember.

862
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:43,140
But it's okay.

863
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:44,840
We just game.

864
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:51,270
Is it one tier?

865
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:55,470
Maybe I'll encounter some role players in this next one.

866
01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:57,490
I told you the Doom queue.

867
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:01,430
I told you guys we're Doom queuing.

868
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:04,390
As bad as things get.

869
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:06,070
I tried to stay positive.

870
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:08,450
Oh, people are trying in this one, right?

871
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:10,450
Let's see.

872
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:11,450
Oh, no.

873
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:14,210
Okay.

874
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:16,390
Hey.

875
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:17,290
Bad.

876
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:19,390
Bad, bad.

877
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:23,090
This is a support only.

878
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:24,470
This is a support group.

879
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:28,390
I don't think you put the rate.

880
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:29,010
Thank you.

881
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:29,950
I got a good stream.

882
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:32,470
This is a support only group.

883
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:32,890
Whoa!

884
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,490
That's right!

885
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:38,590
We support stick together!

886
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:42,990
We're here to cope.

887
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:45,050
That's right.

888
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:46,190
Oh, I see you.

889
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:46,610
You ready?

890
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:47,850
Yeah?

891
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:49,230
Yeah.

892
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:50,450
Oh, that's right.

893
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:53,130
Bad blade.

894
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:56,290
Oh, nice.

895
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:56,830
I got a game.

896
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:57,190
JK.

897
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:58,310
Goodbye.

898
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:02,890
My literal support group.

899
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:17,790
I don't really care much about my elo right now because it's the beginning of season.

900
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:22,190
The rank distribution is like all over the place in the beginning of season.

901
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:26,670
Hey, he started it.

902
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:29,090
He actually started it.

903
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:29,610
Okay.

904
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:33,330
Now, you think I'm allowed to play Jeff?

905
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:34,410
Now.

906
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:37,170
You and I got banished for this match.

907
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:39,950
You think they'll let me play Jeff now.

908
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:42,130
Now I'm allowed to have fun.

909
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:56,140
No, and every game is a practice game until I win.

910
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,060
That's how it goes.

911
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,380
That's the rule of law.

912
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:01,740
What the fuck does he get?

913
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:02,740
Mr. Fantastic.

914
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:03,360
I want...

915
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:04,360
ban sila

916
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:15,260
yeah torch is always meta because like he's so absurdly broken i should ban emma emma fucking sucks too

917
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:36,360
man i just want to learn torch is just whoever has the better torch wins but it's horrible to play with and against no matter what no fantastic is fucking ass and will always be yes

918
01:05:39,380 --> 01:06:29,080
it's just um no black pat no usually it's torch phoenix torch phoenix is the go-to band for the top two dps player dps roles uh or characters just because phoenix has so much value in the alt combo and torch is literally like whoever has the better torch wins but no matter it doesn't even matter you have the better torch it's just fucking miserable to play against the torch torch because he just provides too much value like the his goddamn like uh his goddamn like flame shit like it's like his geometry lesson with the flames is just so annoying yeah jeff is meta in the higher yellow but to be fair he's meta in triple support but i really i want to learn jeff because like i i like playing meta support and a good jeff does so much has so much value

919
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,980
Don't know how to play him right now.

920
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,560
I don't mind like, I don't mind learning Jeff

921
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:48,510
It's beginning season so like I'm allowed to get away with it I mean if it if it doesn't work, I'll still swap.

922
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:51,140
It's not like I'm holding my team hostage for now

923
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:58,870
I'm not holding my teammates hostage yet

924
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:08,420
Jesus Christ I'm not There you go.

925
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,060
I have to like heal my teammates.

926
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:12,640
Focus on healing more.

927
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:18,030
There's a papa!

928
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:29,840
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, I have to- Oh, they got Adam.

929
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:35,200
Oh, they're running extra- wait, are they triple- Oh, they're running extra cringe.

930
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,440
Alright, I have to swap off.

931
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,380
I can't play that against triple support.

932
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:41,560
That sucks.

933
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,840
I need to dive into that one more gate.

934
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:44,400
That sucks.

935
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,500
They're running, they're actually playing meta.

936
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,620
Triple support is hard meta now.

937
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:50,140
You guys didn't know?

938
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,320
It's so cringe.

939
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:55,160
It's literally triple support, triple tank.

940
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,360
We're like, it's ghosts again.

941
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:00,060
Now?

942
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,620
Yeah, but like...

943
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,440
Oh, I missed the pull.

944
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,200
That sucks.

945
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,600
I feel like every...

946
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,120
Every game is whoever is running meta.

947
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:10,960
It's literally meta.

948
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,440
Which sucks.

949
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:21,720
Because, you know, it's really whoever, whichever team wants to play.

950
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:24,760
But yeah, you guys watch them.

951
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,840
What was it?

952
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:28,880
That turn, it was a couple.

953
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:29,680
Bougar bash, the Bougar bash.

954
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:30,920
It was literally all triple support.

955
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:33,540
Unless they ban out triple support.

956
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,880
Yeah, and it's just, it's so boring.

957
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:39,020
I think triple support is such a boring cop.

958
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:56,540
like oh my god i needed to pull that all right i might be dead though unless yay

959
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:12,980
there's a venom behind us oh that's unlucky i couldn't do anything about it our tanks have tunnels as in dogs that's not unlucky you just use white Yeah.

960
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:18,260
Well, it's like a triple support triple tank in the beginning and then swap off to one DPS.

961
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:19,540
Just wait, just wait.

962
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,120
The only thing I know, the only thing like...

963
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,860
It's just so boring though.

964
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:38,820
Alright, that's five.

965
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:41,460
At least we got peel, right?

966
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,180
They're literally winning with the triple support crutch.

967
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:50,500
Oh.

968
01:09:52,340 --> 01:10:09,220
I should like pull him, but like I'm so focused on making sure my team is alive that I keep forgetting the pull Because I want to peel Hi, there's a venom that's just casually poking you guys, but that's okay

969
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:22,440
Oh my god, he had so many support Alright, dude, I'm gonna go off Oh, so deep You can buy heals.

970
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,640
Yeah, he's done.

971
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,520
He's done healing.

972
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:38,680
It's just Venom is such a good destructive.

973
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:43,020
Literally all he's done doing is just...

974
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,020
This sucks for me because...

975
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,280
Thank God I had that in time.

976
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:57,080
Oh my God, thank God my reflex.

977
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:03,720
Hey, guys, wanna be cool if we could, you know, get rid of this guy?

978
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:07,620
Alright.

979
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:11,880
Just need a little push.

980
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:18,780
No one's playing strange, so it's...

981
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:22,000
Alright, if I'm doing solo support, I have to play Rocket.

982
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,220
Invis, solo support ain't it.

983
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:34,220
I have to Yeah, it sucks.

984
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:50,260
I actually have to willingly play rocket Just because I can't heal I honestly don't think I don't know if it's winnable, but like oh wait he swapped off.

985
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:59,820
Okay, that's fine Then I can swap off against him, but like the only reason to play rocket is you have no other support That's really it.

986
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,120
Oh, you got the thing.

987
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,180
I didn't even notice that.

988
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:08,740
Literally, all we had to do was just turn around and kill him.

989
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:09,720
That's really it.

990
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,940
But for some reason, my team doesn't know how to do that.

991
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:17,980
I don't know.

992
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,600
Turning around seems very difficult.

993
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:25,740
It's just a very hard concept, you know?

994
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:58,720
press w key not to not to go backwards it's just that's that's really it it makes no sense holy i mean i have all right now i'll swap off soon i'll put this here just in case we killed three jesus christ how are you so yo Oh my god.

995
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:00,960
Oh, wait, I was gonna say how...

996
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:01,480
We killed three.

997
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:02,320
How the fuck?

998
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:05,440
Hello.

999
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,960
Do we just shoot that guy a little?

1000
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:11,700
Just a little?

1001
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,580
Don't worry, I got you.

1002
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,160
Oh, that is...

1003
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,200
Wait, where is that?

1004
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:19,880
Yeah.

1005
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,740
That's above us.

1006
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,200
Goodbye.

1007
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:30,000
Goodbye.

1008
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:30,420
Goodbye.

1009
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,000
Might die though.

1010
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:32,740
Yep, goodbye.

1011
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:35,540
I was...

1012
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:36,180
I was waiting.

1013
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:36,380
Oh!

1014
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:38,700
Wait, why is my thing?

1015
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,160
Oh, my thing is too far.

1016
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:41,600
I was gonna sit.

1017
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,240
Oh yeah, goodbye to everybody.

1018
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,060
No, this is more of a goodbye to everyone moment.

1019
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:52,820
Well...

1020
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:54,580
I like the right click on this one.

1021
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,780
One, two, zero.

1022
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:00,810
Time to switch things up.

1023
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:32,410
including which side you're on it's okay it's so warm up i can't believe it they use the ultimate crutch triple support i can't believe disgusting also what the fuck this guy was this guy was a lord healer but why was he on dp it's so cringe it's actually so cringe quietly into the background boo I hope they just fucking nurse also.

1024
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:32,930
I don't care.

1025
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:34,350
As a support player, I don't care.

1026
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:37,230
I think I think triple support is just so boring.

1027
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:40,410
It's actually so boring to play with and against

1028
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:46,890
Like I don't care like I don't care.

1029
01:14:47,710 --> 01:14:54,930
I just rather just play 222 Because it's just it's just a triple support is literally just rotating ults.

1030
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:59,910
There's no actual like There's no actual like What's it called?

1031
01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:04,990
I guess, like, plays.

1032
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:06,330
There's no actual plays with that.

1033
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:07,790
Like, no cool plays you can do.

1034
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:12,370
It just makes the game much more boring to play and watch.

1035
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:13,630
Version will be out.

1036
01:15:13,730 --> 01:15:14,810
Oh, the summer skin!

1037
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:16,930
Summer skin in 60 minutes!

1038
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:21,010
Alright, I'm gonna stop the triple support meta.

1039
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,030
Support else just too strong.

1040
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:24,090
That's really it.

1041
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:26,470
Support else should be, like, less strong.

1042
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:30,070
It's just infinite healing.

1043
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:38,650
Jesus Christ actual explosion

1044
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:49,180
oh my god the frame drop there

1045
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,320
uh this is definitely not winnable

1046
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:06,140
this does not feel winnable at all No, I don't think roll Q will stop anything.

1047
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:12,720
I think it's just more so of just make supports less strong, honestly.

1048
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,020
That's nearly it.

1049
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:23,020
Supports are just way too, like the fact that I'm a, I played, I'm a Luna main, but like even then, Luna is way too strong.

1050
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,860
Like she does too much.

1051
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,120
But I know the reason why they did all of this.

1052
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:36,140
was because, um, because they wanted to nerf dive.

1053
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:40,720
They just wanted to nerf dive, but they did too much.

1054
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,240
They did way too much just to nerf dive.

1055
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:49,320
I don't even know.

1056
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:50,140
Did I pull anybody?

1057
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:54,280
Yeah, but so, I think they just, they overturned it.

1058
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,220
They definitely overturned it.

1059
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:59,900
They went from, like, uh, making dive useless.

1060
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,480
Oh my god.

1061
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:03,180
I, I Don't know where I am.

1062
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:07,630
Yeah.

1063
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:09,230
Oh, hey, hun.

1064
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:14,050
Yeah, the time to kill is so long now.

1065
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:18,010
Like, oh my, I was alive for so long doing all that shit.

1066
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:24,820
I mean, I still have fun with rivals.

1067
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:26,360
It's just when...

1068
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,180
Like, I'm in diamond.

1069
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,200
Why the fuck are you playing triple support?

1070
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,400
That's the thing.

1071
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:35,320
Bro, this is D2.

1072
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,020
You don't need elos that much.

1073
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:47,540
You really need elos that much that you're playing triple support.

1074
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:48,480
Really.

1075
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,440
That's crazy.

1076
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,900
They want to win that badly.

1077
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,080
I have to push that guy.

1078
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:01,340
Push you!

1079
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:03,100
Get away from me!

1080
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,160
Okay, that is awkward.

1081
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:14,280
Where the fuck is like, where is my- oh my god, there he is.

1082
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:15,380
There he is.

1083
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:16,240
No!

1084
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:17,680
The damage boost!

1085
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:19,620
I was so close.

1086
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:22,140
I was so- I knew he was gonna do the damage boost too.

1087
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,280
Yeah, I knew it.

1088
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:29,020
I know- I knew that- I know this fucker was doing- Luna, Luna, Luna, 3, 2, 1, Luna, Luna!

1089
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,020
That fucking tryhard, you little bitch.

1090
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,880
You little tryhard.

1091
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:40,220
I could tell that Luna did the fucking damage boost, so I could tell.

1092
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:43,820
I could tell he was, like, yelling at his Luna, the damage boost.

1093
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:45,340
It was so obvious.

1094
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,160
I did fucking try to make sure.

1095
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,840
I have to use it, or I die.

1096
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:58,740
I really didn't want to die.

1097
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:05,560
It's fine.

1098
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:08,100
It's fine.

1099
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,120
It was the risk I was willing to take.

1100
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:16,400
There you go.

1101
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:19,360
Okay.

1102
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,180
That's fine.

1103
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,080
It's our turn!

1104
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:26,540
It's our turn!

1105
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:26,880
It's our turn!

1106
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:27,320
Mind control!

1107
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:29,900
There's no bunny mind control!

1108
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:30,680
Let's go!

1109
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:32,460
That's true.

1110
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,840
Oh my god, he got the touch.

1111
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,500
He actually got the touch.

1112
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,280
Stop!

1113
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:46,860
Nice.

1114
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:54,880
There you go.

1115
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:56,860
Oh, wait.

1116
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:57,660
We win that?

1117
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,300
Let's go.

1118
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:59,640
I actually did not think.

1119
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:06,000
I actually was not expecting us to win.

1120
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:06,940
I take those.

1121
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:09,740
I don't think she knows what.

1122
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,100
Wait, is that not what she was doing?

1123
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,540
She's using her mind control.

1124
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:19,400
I did not think.

1125
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:22,580
I did not think we were going to win.

1126
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,240
I did not think we were gonna win that.

1127
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,940
I am so surprised

1128
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:50,610
We did it Told you guys it's possible everything is possible see trip see a triple support crush and still lose That's what I mean What the fuck are you playing triple support?

01:20:52,870 --> 01:21:18,550

1132
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,940
Triple support is so OP.

1133
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,060
It hurts you.

1134
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:03,560
It hurts you.

1135
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:04,800
IRL too.

1136
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:05,920
You know, I'll update my game.

1137
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:06,560
Give me a sec.

1138
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,340
Let me update my game.

1139
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:10,940
You're right.

1140
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,040
They want me.

1141
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:12,400
He won't.

1142
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:16,260
They're like, you gotta feel the pain physically too.

1143
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:22,700
It should be physical pain on top of the mental anguish.

1144
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:25,640
All right, let me up.

1145
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,080
That was a fast update.

1146
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:28,500
I did not think the update would be that

1147
01:22:32,540 --> 01:23:05,440

1151
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,360
It was only a suggestion.

1152
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:21,900
It's fine.

1153
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,440
I'll do that in 60 minutes.

1154
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:25,640
When the update actually goes through.

1155
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:30,270
Oh, wait.

1156
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:30,990
Do we have drops?

1161
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:35,910
I should fix that.

1162
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:38,390
Um...

1163
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:39,970
All right.

01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:42,070
I need to copy and paste the title.

1165
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:44,890

New patch available.

1169
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,320
It's just to suggest.

1170
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:30,120
It said in 60 minutes.

1171
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:36,770

Wait, actually.

Wait, is the new skins out now now?

01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:14,740
I can't believe it.

1248
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:16,580
They added clothes on it.

1249
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:18,860
They added clothes.

1250
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:19,760
Oh, wait, there's me.

1251
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:21,480
Look, see, guys?

1252
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:22,080
Wait.

1253
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:24,520
Look, guys.

1254
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:26,020
There's me.

1255
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:27,220
Yeah.

1256
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:55,280
you're right how to be fair how else could they improve the original summer thing skin like they already took everything he was already wearing a thong what else could they do i mean they could have like put more rock i guess

1257
01:33:01,420 --> 01:34:11,780
they like released the new skin and it's just the same it's just the same thon skin but like they buffed it a little bit they did they rock stuffing and then it's like and then and then it's times two more expensive than the original skin and people will still buy it i know you'd still buy it more thang yeah and it's just as expensive if not a more expensive it's neon people i put that boulder in the trunk exactly he has that thing thing he has that thing thing in that thong thong thong thong remember that song holy that's an old song what is it called i know it from glee when the fucking teacher sings it in front of his students song the thong song yeah the thong song and like it was like the teacher sang it in front of the students and I was like that's appropriate

1258
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:29,640
no that I only know that song because because of oh wait we have to think because of glee mate thank you for the twitch prime thank you thank you I watched it on that

1259
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:35,100
I watched Glee online.

1260
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,740
I was a, what is it called?

1261
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:39,440
A Gleekster?

1262
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,240
Wait, can you play change?

1263
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:43,380
No, okay.

1264
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:48,580
I will admit, I was obsessed with Glee.

1265
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:51,600
So I kept up with every episode release.

1266
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:57,920
And like nearly all this, like back then, I didn't know a lot of songs.

1267
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:00,080
So every song I've ever learned.

1268
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:02,840
at that time was from Glee.

1269
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:07,260
Like, I've never listened to a Beatles song until Glee did...

1270
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:12,040
Until Glee did the Beatles special episode.

1271
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:16,040
That was the first time I've ever listened to a Beatles.

1272
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:17,960
Nope.

1273
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:19,960
Not a single Beatles song.

1274
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:22,100
I've never listened...

1275
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:27,240
I've never, like, listened to songs other than, like...

1276
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:29,420
Oh, wait, we're not on this thing anymore.

1277
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:59,660
other than like oh my god please I'm trying to save please I am trying to save you right now this might not be a I think it might not be a good idea to run Mantis just saying oh my god Mantis please I am trying so hard to protect you oh my okay fuck this Mantis because like back then I've only listened to like me.

1278
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,860
That was literally the only thing I listened to.

1279
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:07,220
I don't like this comp.

1280
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:15,880
So like, I was just, I just listened to Disney and like whenever someone was like, what's your favorite song?

1281
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:16,820
What's your favorite?

1282
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:17,900
Who's your favorite singer?

1283
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:20,980
And then I wanted to be like, not weird.

1284
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:22,620
And I'll just be like Brittany Spears.

1285
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:29,240
Because that, you know, that's someone I've never listened to a Brittany Spears song.

1286
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:37,060
till Glee, but, like, at that time, I was, before Glee was in my life, I was just like, I know who Brittany Spears is.

1287
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,500
I know her.

1288
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:43,220
It's not weird, if I say I like Germany.

1289
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:45,260
Look him back, look over him.

1290
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:45,560
No bubble.

1291
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:48,160
Yeah, this is.

1292
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:49,980

01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:58,040
Please still care me.

1297
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:58,980

1301
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,060
I have to wait for this, too.

1302
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:40,420
I have to lose this.

1303
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:42,300

01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:54,120
One, one, one, one, one, one.

One, one, one, one, one, one, one.

01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:03,420
I- Why did you run?!

1314
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:06,480
That was interesting.

1315
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:07,760

1316
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:09,540
I know it won!

1317
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:13,280
It was very interesting.

1318
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:14,580
Hello.

1319
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:20,440

01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:25,880
Stay near my wall if you want heals.

1321
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:28,980

He sabotaged.

1325
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:07,700
Holy shit!

1326
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:10,420
You know what's funny?

1327
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:12,100
He sabotaged himself.

1328
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:15,900
Somebody shot him.

1329
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,740
Somebody shot him that caused the proc.

1330
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:18,940
That wasn't me.

1331
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:22,620
He actually, he actually, he walled himself off.

1332
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:24,640
That's crazy.

1333
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,780
He walled himself off.

1334
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:38,170
This is so much harder to play just because I have a mantis.

1335
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:44,080
I have to save my thing.

1336
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:48,150
They're main.

1337
01:39:48,350 --> 01:39:48,810

Thank God.

Your powers are mine.

1343
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:05,330
I am ready to put on a show.

1344
01:40:05,850 --> 01:40:07,410
We have to try to kite this as well as we can.

1345
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:08,490
He doesn't know.

1346
01:40:08,930 --> 01:40:10,010
Yeah, there he is.

1347
01:40:10,230 --> 01:40:11,070
Help your back end, help your back end.

1348
01:40:11,470 --> 01:40:12,890
I have to use this.

1349
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:14,850
I got scared of my team.

1350
01:40:15,470 --> 01:40:16,650
I'm fearing now.

1351
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:19,750
He thought I was there!

1352
01:40:19,990 --> 01:40:20,890

He ran out of leaves.

1398
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:29,670
He ran out of leaves.

1399
01:42:30,130 --> 01:42:31,410
Now it's only her.

1400
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:34,890

1401
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:38,190
What happened?

1402
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:40,230
Now it's just her.

1403
01:42:40,510 --> 01:42:41,830
It's no longer you and me.

1404
01:42:42,370 --> 01:42:43,170
It's just you.

1405
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:45,170

1406
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:45,750

01:42:46,970 --> 01:42:47,950

Wait, wait, wait.

1416
01:43:31,010 --> 01:43:31,450

Why are they on blade?

1420
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:38,750
That's a very interesting thing.

1421
01:43:38,970 --> 01:43:39,970

I felt like.

1424
01:43:45,170 --> 01:43:47,770
I feel like I'm getting harassed.

1425
01:43:47,850 --> 01:43:48,510
On ultron.

1426
01:43:48,750 --> 01:43:49,350
Ultron half.

1427
01:43:51,030 --> 01:43:51,610
Strange log.

1428
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:53,110
Hold my mic.

1429
01:43:53,450 --> 01:43:54,170
I finally have a.

1430
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:56,150

1432
01:43:57,910 --> 01:43:58,190
Nice.

1433
01:43:58,490 --> 01:43:58,950
It's huge.

1434
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:00,570
You can't see me.

1435
01:44:00,850 --> 01:44:00,950
Ha-ha.

1436
01:44:01,210 --> 01:44:01,970
We're in Matt.

1437
01:44:03,370 --> 01:44:03,670
I...

1438
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:06,330
You know, I will let you know.

1439
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:08,430
I could have saved them.

1440
01:44:10,750 --> 01:44:11,050
Good.

1441
01:44:13,330 --> 01:44:14,630
But at that point...

1442
01:44:14,630 --> 01:44:17,930
At that point, I had a message.

1443
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:20,730
It was just saved.

1444
01:44:23,010 --> 01:44:24,650
I could have saved them.

1445
01:44:24,710 --> 01:44:26,190
I had a shield ready.

1446
01:44:27,230 --> 01:44:29,190
He needed to learn a lesson today.

1447
01:44:29,770 --> 01:44:30,870
He had to learn.

1448
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:36,860
And it was about sending a message.

1449
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:40,880

Don't be yellow.

1458
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:04,490
No one cares.

1459
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:06,870

01:45:08,930 --> 01:45:11,910

1466
01:45:22,770 --> 01:45:24,450
I thought it would be my name.

1467
01:45:24,810 --> 01:45:26,170
The change is color.

1472
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:09,680
I left instantly.

1473
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:11,540

1474
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:21,820

My next stream is only like, it's not only, but my next stream is at 5 p.m.

So I can, I can, I could do a little bit of late night grinding.

1485
01:47:23,110 --> 01:47:27,790
It's like, why be depressed and grind off stream when I can be depressed and grind.

1486
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:32,910
When I can, when I can crash out on stream and maybe it'll be content.

1487
01:47:34,690 --> 01:47:59,290
gooning to the new torch skin okay that may or may not be a little annoying though with the with the the color stuff or bad torch yeah i might as well monetize my crash out you know why why earn zero dollars crashing out off stream when i can earn maybe one dollar crashing on stream might as well monetize my depression

1488
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:09,760
this is such a waste of developed style no that's you what the fuck

1491
01:48:36,050 --> 01:48:37,330
It's just banter.

1492
01:48:37,590 --> 01:48:39,870
It's just tee-he banter.

1493
01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:43,170
You know, it's so silly.

1494
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:44,870
Just silly support things, guys.

1495
01:48:45,630 --> 01:48:47,530
Just silly support things.

1496
01:48:50,330 --> 01:48:52,770
Yeah, it was just... It was just bad.

1497
01:48:56,650 --> 01:48:59,930
Yeah, it's like how Phoenix says, like, you are nothing, you know?

1498
01:49:00,050 --> 01:49:01,370
It's clearly the same.

1499
01:49:03,610 --> 01:49:05,950
So whenever I yelled at that man, I was just...

1500
01:49:05,950 --> 01:49:08,630
It was just being like, you know, that's what bros do.

1501
01:49:09,050 --> 01:49:10,050
Silly bandage.

1502
01:49:10,230 --> 01:49:10,990

Why are we still typing to each other?

1510
01:49:42,480 --> 01:50:09,340

1536
01:51:40,410 --> 01:51:41,770
It's no longer yes.

1537
01:51:43,930 --> 01:51:47,670
I was thinking I- I was thinking I could kill that one guy, but I have to spit out.

1538
01:51:48,090 --> 01:51:49,710
Why were they in my mouth?

1539
01:51:50,410 --> 01:51:51,610
Okay, I think I have to swap.

1540
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:52,370
I might be throwing.

1541
01:51:53,550 --> 01:51:54,510
Oh, it's because they have triple.

1542
01:51:54,930 --> 01:51:55,610
It's not fair.

1543
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:56,610
They have triple.

1544
01:51:56,730 --> 01:51:57,370
Oh, my God.

1545
01:51:57,470 --> 01:51:58,190
I literally had to...

1546
01:52:01,710 --> 01:52:02,830
It's not fair.

1547
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:03,810
They have triple.

1548
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:09,010
They can play Jeff.

1549
01:52:12,450 --> 01:52:14,230
Why can't I go yummy, yummy?

1550
01:52:16,830 --> 01:52:17,690

1556
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:32,630
Fuck you in particular.

1557
01:53:35,250 --> 01:53:35,710

01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:37,370
Oh shit.

1560
01:53:37,470 --> 01:53:38,010
No!

1561
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:42,710
I thought my mag would bubble me.

1562
01:53:43,210 --> 01:53:44,370
I thought he would...

1563
01:53:44,370 --> 01:53:45,450
I don't know.

1564
01:53:45,930 --> 01:53:47,790
I thought he would bubble me.

1565
01:53:48,210 --> 01:53:49,450
I really did.

1566
01:53:49,950 --> 01:53:50,450
I...

1567
01:53:52,830 --> 01:53:55,910
I thought he would bubble me.

1568
01:53:57,140 --> 01:53:58,470
I looked at him.

1569
01:53:58,470 --> 01:54:02,750
I was like, come on, bubble me.

1570
01:54:07,290 --> 01:54:08,970
No, you want to.

1571
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:11,510
There's a lot.

1572
01:54:12,130 --> 01:54:13,270
I don't get no bubbles.

1573
01:54:15,570 --> 01:54:16,570
Yeah, it's good.

1574
01:54:16,730 --> 01:54:18,510
It's very good in triple support.

1575
01:54:23,710 --> 01:54:26,450
It's very, very good at triple support.

1576
01:54:28,270 --> 01:54:30,110
I'm so hungry.

1577
01:54:30,990 --> 01:54:32,610
Please feed me.

1578
01:54:33,030 --> 01:54:35,510
I'm so hungry.

1579
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:36,990
I...

1580
01:54:39,650 --> 01:54:41,550
Okay, not...

1581
01:54:41,550 --> 01:54:43,130
Okay, I will say...

1582
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:51,030
Maybe the customizable colors in chat might not be the best.

1583
01:54:55,690 --> 01:54:56,790
Just a maybe.

1584
01:55:06,270 --> 01:55:07,590
Alright, here we go.

1585
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:17,740
Okay,

1586
01:55:21,180 --> 01:55:21,920

1587
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:23,080
Wait, what's my HP?

1588
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:24,160

1589
01:55:24,620 --> 01:55:25,140
Oh, they have...

1590
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:26,200
I forgot they have Mantis.

1591
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:28,800
Oh, I wasn't fully healed.

1592
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:30,300

1593
01:55:31,780 --> 01:55:33,460

Oh, yeah.

1595
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:39,920

1596
01:55:40,780 --> 01:55:41,520

1604
01:58:10,100 --> 01:58:12,560
It is just unwinnable, sadly.

1605
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:14,700
Just a little bit of a team diff.

1606
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:20,380
Just a tiny bit.

1607
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:27,920
It's fine.

1608
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:29,460
It's fine.

1609
01:58:29,540 --> 01:58:31,700
It's a team diff, except I did my job.

1610
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:34,440
So it's everybody else's fault but mine.

1611
01:58:37,220 --> 01:58:39,600
I feel like, when did I get triple support?

1612
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:40,600
I want to play Jeff.

1613
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,200
When did I get triple support?

1614
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:43,500
It's not fair.

1615
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:45,400
It's not fair.

1616
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:49,800
Everyone else gets triple support.

1617
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:51,840
Why can't I get triple support?

1618
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:53,920
When do I get meta?

1619
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:57,840
By my royal decree.

1620
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:00,420
I want my triple support.

1621
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:02,620
Hello, role players.

1622
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:03,960
Hello.

1623
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:04,760
Hello.

1624
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:07,200
Hello.

1625
01:59:07,220 --> 01:59:07,580
Everyone.

1626
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:08,100
Whoa!

1627
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:08,960
Whoa!

1628
01:59:13,860 --> 01:59:14,740
I thought...

1629
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:16,860
I thought we were friends!

1630
01:59:20,060 --> 01:59:21,380
What do you mean meta my die?

1631
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:23,600
Literally the enemy team is playing meta.

1632
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:24,920
What do you mean?

1633
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:29,200
How do I get out of here?

1634
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:30,420
I don't know this map.

1635
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:33,360
Oh my god, I've never been to this site.

1636
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:34,160
Where am I?

1637
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:35,200
I've never been here before.

1638
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:37,000
I've always been role-playing.

1639
01:59:37,220 --> 01:59:38,760
I've never seen this area before.

1640
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:43,660
I was like, that area exists?

1641
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:46,140
Oh my god, where am I?

1642
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:47,340
Wait, am I fighting?

1643
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:49,000
Hello.

1644
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:50,820
What the fuck are they doing over there?

1645
01:59:50,940 --> 01:59:51,280
Hi.

1646
01:59:52,980 --> 01:59:54,660
You shoot me one more time, I swear to God.

1647
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:58,780
I swear to God, if you shoot me one more time, I swear to God, where are you?

1648
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:01,900
That's right, I swear to God, I ain't playing around.

1649
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:05,380
I ain't fucking playing around.

1650
02:00:05,540 --> 02:00:06,100
I can aim.

1651
02:00:08,660 --> 02:00:09,820
That's right.

1652
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:12,000
I told you I ain't...

1653
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:18,820
I told you I ain't playing around.

1654
02:00:20,060 --> 02:00:20,820
Alright, it's EV.

1655
02:00:23,460 --> 02:00:25,480
I gave him a warning.

1656
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:29,860
I warned him.

1657
02:00:30,220 --> 02:00:30,500
Hey.

1658
02:00:31,740 --> 02:00:32,260
Hello.

1659
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:33,060
Hey.

1660
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:34,400
Alright, that's it.

1661
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:35,200
That's it.

1662
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:35,780
I'm coming over.

1663
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:36,900
I'm coming over.

1664
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:38,080
That's what you were...

1665
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:39,220
are you?

1666
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:41,540
That's fucking right.

1667
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:45,100
We just hanging out.

1668
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:48,320
Hello, fellow Jeff.

1669
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:49,780
Hello.

1670
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:55,080
Oh my god, he got snapped out of existence.

1671
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:57,080
Hello,

1672
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:01,080
everybody.

1673
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:04,160
Oh, he's playing a ukulele.

1674
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:06,320
That's right.

1675
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:07,980
Play music for us.

1676
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,180
Play music for the chat.

1677
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:10,740
Whoa!

1678
02:01:11,220 --> 02:01:12,980
He's like, that's my thing.

1679
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:15,240
He's playing for me.

1680
02:01:16,780 --> 02:01:17,100
Yay!

1681
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:19,640
We don't have any emotes.

1682
02:01:19,900 --> 02:01:20,240
I don't.

1683
02:01:20,360 --> 02:01:21,260
Wait, I just have the regular.

1684
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:23,940
Hello.

1685
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:25,740
There can only be one.

1686
02:01:28,300 --> 02:01:29,500
Hello, everybody.

1687
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:31,000
Kami already has the skin.

1688
02:01:31,660 --> 02:01:34,040
It's like everybody got on just for...

1689
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:35,620
Just to buy the summer skin.

1690
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:38,500
Oh shit.

1691
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:40,100
That's fucked up, Philly.

1692
02:01:41,220 --> 02:01:41,920
Like, that just...

1693
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:42,260
Whoa!

1694
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:51,320
He was just there.

1695
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:52,040
I'm sorry.

1696
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:52,720
It was just...

1697
02:01:56,980 --> 02:01:57,940
I just...

1698
02:01:58,260 --> 02:01:59,360
I just wanted to chomp.

1699
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:00,080
I'm sorry.

1700
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:00,820
It was just there.

1701
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:06,260
Jeff hate that act.

1702
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:10,760
One for the road, you know?

1703
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:16,910
Before I got to go out.

1704
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:23,480
Another widow player?

1705
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:30,040
Oh, mom.

1706
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:33,660
Now, who am I going to banish from this match?

1707
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:34,920
Yeah, who?

1708
02:02:38,940 --> 02:02:39,500
Sue?

1709
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:41,820
What the fuck has Sue did to you?

1710
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:46,100
Like, Sue is such a random ban.

1711
02:02:46,780 --> 02:02:48,400
Like, she's not that OP.

1712
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:49,580
IMO.

1713
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:53,060
I just banned Torch.

1714
02:02:55,980 --> 02:02:57,560
That's such a random ban.

1715
02:02:58,460 --> 02:02:58,940
IMO.

1716
02:03:00,980 --> 02:03:02,160
I just banned Torch.

1717
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:02,680
Fuck that.

1718
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:03,120
Oh, wait.

1719
02:03:03,420 --> 02:03:04,280
He's a...

1720
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:05,200
God damn it.

1721
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:05,600
Okay.

1722
02:03:05,820 --> 02:03:06,720
I'll let him play.

1723
02:03:07,660 --> 02:03:08,620
He's a Lord Jeff.

1724
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:09,800
He knows what he's doing.

1725
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:12,520
And I may or may not not know what I'm doing.

1726
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:16,500
I definitely don't know what I'm doing

1727
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:52,770
Wow Alright The big bro Jeff I guess I'll play Luna I'm gonna play cloak I'm gonna play cloak I haven't played cloak in so long And I don't know I just I just wanna play something outside of Luna I've been in Luna jail for so long I've been in Luna jail for so long I've been in Luna jail for so many seasons.

1728
02:03:52,890 --> 02:03:54,570
I just want to play something new.

1729
02:03:55,670 --> 02:03:57,670
It's a D2, but the rank just reset.

1730
02:03:58,190 --> 02:04:00,950
So, but all the pros are in GM and Celestial now.

1731
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:05,850
I might be trolling a little bit, too, because I was D1.

1732
02:04:08,310 --> 02:04:11,250
I was D1, so I may or may not have been trolling.

1733
02:04:14,410 --> 02:04:14,770
Free.

1734
02:04:14,950 --> 02:04:15,890

That's crazy.

1747
02:04:57,470 --> 02:04:59,630
Yeah, I'll do that for him.

1748
02:04:59,730 --> 02:05:00,410
That would have been an aura.

1749
02:05:03,410 --> 02:05:04,990
That was crazy.

1750
02:05:05,270 --> 02:05:06,610
Watch this.

1751
02:05:07,270 --> 02:05:08,070

02:05:09,690 --> 02:05:11,010
Oh yeah, they have an emma now.

1753
02:05:16,700 --> 02:05:18,420

1754
02:05:19,460 --> 02:05:21,120
I'm gonna use blood, just because I can.

1755
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:23,900

Yay!

1767
02:05:57,140 --> 02:05:58,540
Don't have to aim.

1768
02:05:59,240 --> 02:06:00,180
Just hold left click.

1769
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:04,560
Yippee!

1770
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:07,100
Just left click things.

1771
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:08,060
Oh my god, we all have a lot.

1772
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:11,560
I don't recognize anybody in my lobby.

1773
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:15,660
Also, to be fair, they're all like way above me right now.

1774
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:17,760
I'm too lazy.

1775
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:19,060
Go grab that.

1776
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:23,880
Maybe our Jeff will all first.

1777
02:06:24,460 --> 02:06:25,740
Wait, what if I all first?

1778
02:06:26,080 --> 02:06:27,240
I'm gonna do it.

1779
02:06:27,240 --> 02:06:28,060
Oh my god, what?

1780
02:06:28,780 --> 02:06:31,740
Oh my god, shoot me!

1781
02:06:31,820 --> 02:06:36,930
Oh my god, shoot me!

1782
02:06:38,710 --> 02:06:39,390
I...

1783
02:06:39,390 --> 02:06:41,630
I thought I'd get shielded.

1784
02:06:41,850 --> 02:06:42,470
I don't...

1785
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:44,090
I, you know...

1786
02:06:44,090 --> 02:06:46,030
I thought I'd get shielded.

1787
02:06:46,470 --> 02:06:47,150
I...

1788
02:06:48,950 --> 02:06:49,630
Our...

1789
02:06:49,630 --> 02:06:51,570
Our Hulk might have shielded...

1790
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:52,790
We had double shield!

1791
02:06:53,150 --> 02:06:56,910
The fact that our Hulk's shielded so early.

1792
02:06:57,370 --> 02:06:57,810
And then...

1793
02:06:57,830 --> 02:07:02,530
And then our mag did not shield me right after it.

1794
02:07:02,750 --> 02:07:06,290
That's that's the part that sucks Like what's the point?

1795
02:07:06,770 --> 02:07:10,250
We had double shields and I still wasn't shielded.

1796
02:07:10,590 --> 02:07:11,750
That's crazy

1797
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:20,040
That's actually crazy.

We're okay.

1810
02:08:37,540 --> 02:08:38,240
I don't have to up.

I don't have to all see.

1812
02:08:41,580 --> 02:08:42,520
I don't have to up.

1813
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:44,860
I can hold restraint.

1814
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:48,480
I have restraint.

1815
02:08:50,660 --> 02:08:51,760

02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:52,540

02:08:52,740 --> 02:08:53,540
And then they run triple.

1818
02:08:53,640 --> 02:08:54,140
They're losing.

1819
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:55,620
They're like, what do we do, guys?

1820
02:08:55,940 --> 02:08:56,560
We're losing.

1821
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:57,620
Don't worry.

1822
02:08:58,160 --> 02:08:59,860
We'll just run triple support.

1823
02:09:00,340 --> 02:09:01,340
It always works.

1824
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:05,920
It just always works.

1825
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:09,000
You got a wolf now.

02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:09,680
Watch out, Meg.

02:09:27,860 --> 02:09:28,580
Oh, he missed.

1835
02:09:28,580 --> 02:09:29,060

1836
02:09:29,380 --> 02:09:29,580
He missed.

1837
02:09:29,780 --> 02:09:30,560
He fucking missed.

1838
02:09:30,740 --> 02:09:31,040
It's fine.

1839
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:35,300
Oh, now you use that bubble.

02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:39,180
Oh, now you use the bubble!

02:09:39,940 --> 02:09:40,560
I see.

1842
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:42,560
I see how it is.

1843
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:45,420
I see how it is.

1844
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:49,520
That's actually crazy.

1845
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:52,660
That is crazy.

1846
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:55,860
Thank God he fucking missed it.

1847
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:56,780
He's so lucky.

1848
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:01,600
What the fuck?

1849
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:02,880
Oh my god.

1850
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:04,420
Oh my god.

1851
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:05,120
No, this is bad.

1852
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:06,140
This is...

1853
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:37,580
It's fine There you go There you go I had two shields I had two shields And yet I get zero Like how is that possible We are cloak and dagger I looked at him in the eye That's the worst part I looked at my mag in the eye Lord Icon.

1854
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:39,320
And I didn't get a shield.

1855
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:44,940
It was just, we were just so lucky that the other mag never, never tried basketball before.

1856
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:48,600
We were so lucky.

1857
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,880
He doesn't know how to play basketball.

1858
02:10:59,270 --> 02:10:59,790
Wee.

1859
02:11:00,110 --> 02:11:01,110
Oh, he's off of Jeff.

1860
02:11:02,870 --> 02:11:03,930
I could have died.

1861
02:11:04,010 --> 02:11:08,790
I looked at my mag in the eye and I saw death, but you think that he whiffed.

1862
02:11:11,650 --> 02:11:15,630
Like, they're just teasing me with the fact that we have double shield.

1863
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:20,610
They're like, we could shield you.

1864
02:11:21,070 --> 02:11:22,750
Be pretty silly when we do.

1865
02:11:25,790 --> 02:11:27,370
That's a different, I'm not gonna lie.

1866
02:11:30,010 --> 02:11:30,330
Alright.

1867
02:11:33,330 --> 02:11:36,490
Like, wouldn't it be funny if we shielded you right now?

1868
02:11:36,570 --> 02:11:38,270
And I'm like, that would be pretty funny.

1869
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:44,160
funny right now.

1870
02:11:48,690 --> 02:11:49,990
Cloak is so fucking easy.

1871
02:11:50,170 --> 02:11:51,570
I think, like, Cloak...

1872
02:11:51,570 --> 02:11:52,410
Wait, is that ours?

1873
02:11:52,530 --> 02:11:52,850
Yeah.

1874
02:11:53,230 --> 02:11:54,190
It's red!

1875
02:11:54,590 --> 02:11:55,490
I couldn't tell.

1876
02:11:58,330 --> 02:12:00,130
You don't understand it was red.

1877
02:12:00,230 --> 02:12:02,810
I thought it was... I thought it was the enemy squid.

1878
02:12:06,550 --> 02:12:07,030
Okay.

1879
02:12:08,530 --> 02:12:11,250
This is not a lot of healing, which is a little scary.

1880
02:12:12,610 --> 02:12:14,530
Like, the best thing I can do is just...

1881
02:12:16,470 --> 02:12:17,550
All right.

1882
02:12:17,870 --> 02:12:22,510
Oh, I guess it's for the scarlet Don't worry.

1883
02:12:22,510 --> 02:12:23,670
I got you.

1884
02:12:23,850 --> 02:12:24,670
I got you.

1885
02:12:25,510 --> 02:12:26,110
Don't worry

1886
02:12:29,170 --> 02:12:33,510
Okay, I can I can glide in line that's right.

1887
02:12:33,690 --> 02:12:39,370
I can't see shit now I'm lucky to go Guys, I'm lucky to go.

1888
02:12:39,450 --> 02:12:40,290
You're just crazy.

1889
02:12:40,490 --> 02:12:46,190
I had a widow go 20 in one last game You're doing it guys We're doing it.

1890
02:12:46,950 --> 02:12:49,090
To be fair, he does have a damage boost though.

1891
02:12:49,450 --> 02:12:50,370
To be fair, guys.

1892
02:12:50,810 --> 02:12:52,170
He has a damage boost.

1893
02:12:54,550 --> 02:12:56,330
That simple geometry.

1894
02:12:56,770 --> 02:12:57,490
Look at that!

1895
02:12:59,290 --> 02:13:00,310
Maybe I'm the goat.

1896
02:13:03,570 --> 02:13:06,330
Actual geometry lesson we're having right now.

1897
02:13:08,130 --> 02:13:08,730
Okay.

1898
02:13:09,590 --> 02:13:10,550
That's good.

1899
02:13:11,070 --> 02:13:12,610
Hey guys, do we have...

1900
02:13:12,610 --> 02:13:13,450
Okay, there he is.

1901
02:13:13,490 --> 02:13:14,150
He's over there.

1902
02:13:14,770 --> 02:13:15,710
He's over there.

1903
02:13:15,870 --> 02:13:16,050
Oh, wait.

1904
02:13:16,250 --> 02:13:16,770
We killed him.

1905
02:13:17,690 --> 02:13:19,150
I feel it.

1906
02:13:19,930 --> 02:13:21,310
Oh, my God.

1907
02:13:23,390 --> 02:13:24,050
Oh, my God.

1908
02:13:24,310 --> 02:13:24,850
Oh, my God.

1909
02:13:25,330 --> 02:13:27,270
Oh, my God.

1910
02:13:28,010 --> 02:13:29,110
Holy shit.

1911
02:13:29,450 --> 02:13:29,690
Okay.

1912
02:13:30,010 --> 02:13:32,050
That wall was crazy.

1913
02:13:32,410 --> 02:13:33,690
That was such a...

1914
02:13:33,690 --> 02:13:35,790
That was a crazy-ass wall.

1915
02:13:36,430 --> 02:13:37,530
And they lost?

1916
02:13:38,370 --> 02:13:40,210
It's like a crazy wall.

1917
02:13:40,890 --> 02:13:42,450
He could have won that.

1918
02:13:43,010 --> 02:13:44,290
That was a huge wall.

1919
02:13:44,770 --> 02:13:46,970
He knew I was the only one that didn't get walled too.

1920
02:13:47,010 --> 02:13:47,890
That was wild.

1921
02:13:51,030 --> 02:13:52,550
I feel like anyone can play Cloak.

1922
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:54,990
If you can't aim, like, Cloak is...

1923
02:13:54,990 --> 02:13:55,990
Cloak is just brain.

1924
02:13:56,910 --> 02:13:57,950
It's literally just brain.

1925
02:14:01,650 --> 02:14:02,390
Oh, good.

1926
02:14:03,850 --> 02:14:04,330
Goodbye.

1927
02:14:06,310 --> 02:14:06,790
No!

1928
02:14:13,670 --> 02:14:15,410
Yeah, he bubbles me finally.

1929
02:14:16,430 --> 02:14:17,270
We're portaling.

1930
02:14:17,590 --> 02:14:18,190
Oh, we don't.

1931
02:14:18,230 --> 02:14:19,010
Oh, we're portaling.

1932
02:14:22,330 --> 02:14:22,770
We...

1933
02:14:22,770 --> 02:14:23,850
Wait, we're not portaling.

1934
02:14:24,010 --> 02:14:24,370
Okay, wait.

1935
02:14:24,450 --> 02:14:25,350
Why did he swap Strange?

1936
02:14:25,450 --> 02:14:25,610
I'm touching.

1937
02:14:25,810 --> 02:14:26,630
Wait, he's right.

1938
02:14:27,010 --> 02:14:29,450
Why did you swap Strange if you're not going to portal?

1939
02:14:29,730 --> 02:14:30,690
He's so right.

1940
02:14:31,610 --> 02:14:33,610
I am equally as confused.

1941
02:14:34,490 --> 02:14:34,970
Oh, nice.

1942
02:14:37,550 --> 02:14:37,990
Yay.

1943
02:14:40,910 --> 02:14:41,350
Alright.

1944
02:14:43,010 --> 02:14:43,890
We have...

1945
02:14:43,890 --> 02:14:45,110
I might be able to build all in time.

1946
02:14:46,110 --> 02:14:46,310
Oh.

1947
02:14:46,330 --> 02:15:47,570
a 5d move it makes them think we're you're right they think we're gonna portal because of it oh that was so smart then they positioned themselves for a portal play but little did they know our strange was slowly just walking towards us little do they know i have to do this i hope they oh my god i don't know oh this is bad for me because I can Come on Jump down Come on Damage boost Ooh Oh our mantis Oh my god That is a lot of damage Oh Oh Plan We're dead We're dead though We're so dead We're so dead You gotta get a portal off I can't Or no Fuck my Uh Whoever died there,

1948
02:15:47,730 --> 02:15:48,790
but...

1949
02:15:48,790 --> 02:15:50,330
I predicted it.

1950
02:15:50,670 --> 02:15:53,330
I was actual 800 IQ that...

1951
02:15:56,510 --> 02:15:57,910
Don't worry, I'm here.

1952
02:15:58,530 --> 02:16:00,030
Triple support now.

1953
02:16:01,410 --> 02:16:03,610
I don't know if we're...

1954
02:16:03,610 --> 02:16:04,070
Yeah.

1955
02:16:04,810 --> 02:16:07,550
I don't think we make that.

1956
02:16:09,110 --> 02:16:09,970
I'm probably on Mantis.

1957
02:16:10,270 --> 02:16:10,690
Oh, and then swap.

1958
02:16:11,210 --> 02:16:13,450
Yeah, yeah, we definitely need to swap that Mantis.

1959
02:16:13,590 --> 02:16:14,950
We are not doing enough healers.

1960
02:16:17,350 --> 02:16:21,070
I'll try for a little bit longer, but I'll probably swap despite the teammate.

1961
02:16:22,530 --> 02:16:23,570
I don't think we need a swap.

1962
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:25,030
I don't know.

1963
02:16:25,270 --> 02:16:26,450
I think we just need a mag.

1964
02:16:26,630 --> 02:16:27,350
That's really it.

1965
02:16:28,150 --> 02:16:29,230
We definitely just...

1966
02:16:29,230 --> 02:16:29,930
Oh my god.

1967
02:16:30,350 --> 02:16:31,110
Please save him.

1968
02:16:31,610 --> 02:16:33,230
Please save this poor mag.

1969
02:16:34,710 --> 02:16:35,090
Nice.

1970
02:16:36,030 --> 02:16:36,810
Yummy, yummy.

1971
02:16:37,210 --> 02:16:37,910
Yummy, yummy.

1972
02:16:38,790 --> 02:16:39,590
Just left click.

1973
02:16:40,230 --> 02:16:40,610
Yummy, yummy.

1974
02:16:41,290 --> 02:16:41,650
Just left click.

1975
02:16:41,650 --> 02:16:42,090
Yummy, yummy.

1976
02:16:43,130 --> 02:16:44,050
I got you.

1977
02:16:44,210 --> 02:16:45,150
I don't get one!

1978
02:16:45,610 --> 02:16:45,970
There we go.

1979
02:16:47,830 --> 02:16:49,770
I know you're one, I won't stop.

1980
02:16:51,470 --> 02:16:52,290
So skilled.

1981
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:53,810
Just left click.

1982
02:16:55,510 --> 02:16:57,430
It's literally cloak is just...

1983
02:16:57,430 --> 02:16:58,670
If you can't aim, just play cloak.

1984
02:16:59,710 --> 02:17:01,550
It's just literally just brain.

1985
02:17:03,250 --> 02:17:04,610
Brain and like...

1986
02:17:04,610 --> 02:17:06,950
If you have a mic, maybe it'd be a lot better.

1987
02:17:10,550 --> 02:17:14,230
It'll be more ideal if you play cloak with a mic, to be fair.

1988
02:17:16,570 --> 02:17:19,370
Because so you can actually coordinate the...

1989
02:17:19,370 --> 02:17:20,110
You guys are one.

1990
02:17:21,850 --> 02:17:23,850
Oh my god, I'm gonna say, is he okay?

1991
02:17:25,090 --> 02:17:27,970
I literally have not let go of left click.

1992
02:17:30,750 --> 02:17:32,010
I'm just left clicking.

1993
02:17:35,690 --> 02:17:37,150
Just un-bungo, bungo, left click.

1994
02:17:39,870 --> 02:17:41,930
I think it's just good to pre-heal too.

1995
02:17:42,490 --> 02:17:46,150
You know, like just peel and pre-heal just in case they do take damage.

1996
02:17:46,330 --> 02:17:47,230
All right.

1997
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:52,780
Hello.

1998
02:17:55,600 --> 02:17:55,900
Nice.

1999
02:17:57,740 --> 02:17:58,780
I'm blinded.

2000
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:03,540
That's fine.

2001
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:04,960
Oh, goodbye, everyone.

2002
02:18:05,180 --> 02:18:06,280
Oh, wait.

2003
02:18:06,500 --> 02:18:06,940
We live.

2004
02:18:08,220 --> 02:18:08,440
Okay.

2005
02:18:08,980 --> 02:18:10,260
Okay, some of us live.

2006
02:18:12,140 --> 02:18:12,920
I still have mine.

2007
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:14,420
I should have cloaked earlier.

2008
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:16,400
It's okay.

2009
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:17,500
I'm alive.

2010
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:20,560
Oh, I thought that would hit the left side.

2011
02:18:21,260 --> 02:18:21,940
Okay, go over there.

2012
02:18:22,140 --> 02:18:22,320
Go over.

2013
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:23,440
No, no, no!

2014
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:25,960
You have to go the other way!

2015
02:18:27,140 --> 02:18:27,760
Oh, God.

2016
02:18:28,680 --> 02:18:29,980
Oh, God, there's so many walls.

2017
02:18:30,940 --> 02:18:32,200
There's so many walls.

2018
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:34,800
What do I do with all these walls?

2019
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:36,880
Oh, he was so low.

2020
02:18:37,500 --> 02:18:38,920
He was so low, too.

2021
02:18:40,540 --> 02:18:41,260
He has...

2022
02:18:41,260 --> 02:18:42,200
He has Trial.

2023
02:18:43,160 --> 02:18:43,800
I can tell.

2024
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:46,660
Oh, my...

2025
02:18:46,660 --> 02:18:47,420
I'm so...

2026
02:18:47,420 --> 02:18:47,740
I'm so...

2027
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:48,360
I'm scared.

2028
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:53,660
There you go.

2029
02:18:53,980 --> 02:18:54,480
He's one.

2030
02:18:54,680 --> 02:18:55,020
Come on.

2031
02:18:55,100 --> 02:18:55,940
Come on.

2032
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:56,380
Come on.

2033
02:18:56,440 --> 02:18:57,000
Let me hit you.

2034
02:18:59,120 --> 02:19:00,180
Wait, you had tree art.

2035
02:19:00,260 --> 02:19:01,320
You still haven't used it.

2036
02:19:01,460 --> 02:19:01,840
Let's go.

2037
02:19:02,360 --> 02:19:02,760
Yay!

2038
02:19:04,440 --> 02:19:06,360
I almost didn't fucking kill them.

2039
02:19:07,140 --> 02:19:08,280
Oh, there was.

2040
02:19:10,780 --> 02:19:12,200
We did it.

2041
02:19:15,300 --> 02:19:16,580
I was so surprised.

2042
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:17,780
The tree never ulted.

2043
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:20,780
He literally had, I was waiting for him to all.

2044
02:19:20,940 --> 02:19:23,920
I stayed in cloak for him for so long because of it.

2045
02:19:24,360 --> 02:19:25,620
I was like, he's gonna do it.

2046
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:26,520
He's gonna do it.

2047
02:19:26,560 --> 02:19:27,940
Now I'm gonna disappear.

2048
02:19:31,440 --> 02:19:33,660
I literally didn't, I didn't even let go of left click.

2049
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:35,400
I just kept healing.

2050
02:19:36,460 --> 02:19:37,340
Look at so easy.

2051
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:41,060
I feel like my only counter is literally in the mag.

2052
02:19:41,880 --> 02:19:42,460
Oh, I forgot.

2053
02:19:42,660 --> 02:19:44,060
No, I keep accident.

2054
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:46,340
I'm so not used to being...

2055
02:19:47,800 --> 02:19:55,460
a leader because i'm solo keep forgetting to just click the q one more game

2056
02:20:00,780 --> 02:20:25,940

raccoon why for what reason do they have a penny player some shit we're all buying emma fuck this yeah oh bp really I'll fucking ban ammo instead.

2060
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:46,460
That's so fast, though.

2061
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:48,140
The fact that you guys Angela is this fast.

2062
02:21:55,770 --> 02:21:58,910
I'm just happy we're winning against triple support players.

2063
02:22:00,510 --> 02:22:02,450
Because that just means you're not playing correctly.

2064
02:22:09,530 --> 02:22:13,070
Like, if they're losing with triple support, they just don't know how to play it correctly.

2065
02:22:17,610 --> 02:22:19,170
Bum, bum, bum.

2066
02:22:20,670 --> 02:22:22,390
Because it's so OP.

2067
02:22:23,350 --> 02:22:24,290
It's such an OP comp.

2068
02:22:26,330 --> 02:22:32,370
When I was playing, when I was playing, because I ended Eternity.

2069
02:22:32,830 --> 02:22:34,190
Because I always try to end Eternity.

2070
02:22:34,910 --> 02:22:37,670
I don't try one above all anymore.

2071
02:22:38,130 --> 02:22:39,590
Because I just don't have the time.

2072
02:22:41,170 --> 02:22:42,510
I just don't have the time.

2073
02:22:42,950 --> 02:22:44,010
So I just try to get to Eternity.

2074
02:22:44,090 --> 02:22:53,650
And then every time, in Eternity, lobby is literally just whoever had triple cop wins it was so oh god it was so cancer

2075
02:22:56,910 --> 02:22:58,190
it's so annoying

2076
02:23:07,320 --> 02:23:10,080
wait i forgot to show you guys my jeff hours

2077
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:21,820
i should like watch jeff like just play pros and see how they play because i'm just own style.

2078
02:23:23,380 --> 02:23:26,820
I don't think I'm playing the right way of Jeff.

2079
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:36,460
I'm literally just playing how I think might be it might be correct, but I don't think it's that correct.

2080
02:23:37,320 --> 02:23:37,400
Nice.

2081
02:23:40,440 --> 02:23:41,940
Hey guys, let's push the cart.

2082
02:23:42,920 --> 02:23:44,580
That'd be pretty cool.

2083
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:49,180
That'd be that difficult.

2084
02:23:49,300 --> 02:23:49,800
I don't know.

2085
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:51,820
That that different?

2086
02:23:51,900 --> 02:23:52,240
I don't know.

2087
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:52,720
That's the thing.

2088
02:23:52,840 --> 02:24:07,340
I don't know how actual Jeff players play Because the jet play style changed since like it's a different play style compared to like what it actually What like last two seasons ago was because two seasons like oh my god two seasons ago.

2089
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:11,700
It was Two seasons ago.

2090
02:24:11,860 --> 02:24:19,240
It was a flank you play as a flanker You play Jeff, but now now it's uh

2091
02:24:28,110 --> 02:24:29,510
Oh my god, please, no!

2092
02:24:31,910 --> 02:24:34,390
Oh, he cloaked it, I thought he didn't have cloak.

2093
02:24:35,750 --> 02:24:37,950
I only, I used it as a support ult though.

2094
02:24:39,910 --> 02:24:44,330
But yeah, in the, like, if you guys don't remember, Jeff used to be played as a flanker.

2095
02:24:45,310 --> 02:24:51,370
And, um, he was played as a flanker and all you have to do is just, like, go in the back line.

2096
02:24:52,090 --> 02:24:54,330
Guys, please, can we have two at least?

2097
02:24:57,490 --> 02:25:00,230
I used it as a defensive ult, guys.

2098
02:25:00,690 --> 02:25:02,250
It was a defensive ult.

2099
02:25:03,250 --> 02:25:06,970
Me grabbing someone would have been a oh my god, okay.

2100
02:25:08,250 --> 02:25:08,870
Guys, I'm learning.

2101
02:25:08,990 --> 02:25:09,730
I'm learning Jeff.

2102
02:25:10,170 --> 02:25:11,170
I'm learning Jeff, guys.

2103
02:25:14,390 --> 02:25:16,750
I'm just I'm trying my best.

2104
02:25:18,330 --> 02:25:20,230
Orange is fucking dead, dead.

2105
02:25:21,270 --> 02:25:21,890
I don't yeah.

2106
02:25:23,550 --> 02:25:25,070
I'm trying my best.

2107
02:25:25,230 --> 02:25:26,290
I'm trying to figure it out.

2108
02:25:27,870 --> 02:25:29,790
I might have to swap off Jeff though.

2109
02:25:30,410 --> 02:25:31,950
It might not be it.

2110
02:25:34,590 --> 02:25:35,430
Okay, nice.

2111
02:25:38,410 --> 02:25:39,730
Oh my god.

2112
02:25:40,090 --> 02:25:40,550
Good luck.

2113
02:25:44,730 --> 02:25:48,690
Okay, I might have fucked up because I did spit at...

2114
02:25:48,690 --> 02:25:51,510
I spit at the Denna all a little bit.

2115
02:25:52,630 --> 02:25:53,570
Learned Jeff and rank?

2116
02:25:54,070 --> 02:25:56,470
I mean, that's how I learned every other character.

2117
02:25:57,490 --> 02:26:00,090
That's how I learn all the other supports.

2118
02:26:00,270 --> 02:26:01,750
It's just much more easier to learn here.

2119
02:26:01,930 --> 02:26:03,230
It's not, and it's the beginning of season.

2120
02:26:03,570 --> 02:26:07,730
So it's like, it's not like I'm throwing high-y-low games.

2121
02:26:10,310 --> 02:26:11,270
Oh shit, wait, that's good.

2122
02:26:12,390 --> 02:26:13,130
That's insane.

2123
02:26:13,910 --> 02:26:14,630
That was a good ult.

2124
02:26:17,710 --> 02:26:18,690
Use the speed!

2125
02:26:19,750 --> 02:26:20,190
Speed!

2126
02:26:21,470 --> 02:26:21,830
Okay.

2127
02:26:22,630 --> 02:26:23,470
I'll go push.

2128
02:26:24,350 --> 02:26:25,850
Yeah, it's sink or swim.

2129
02:26:26,830 --> 02:26:27,270
Exactly.

2130
02:26:29,090 --> 02:26:31,670
I just need to figure out how to do the all.

2131
02:26:31,990 --> 02:26:32,750
That's it.

2132
02:26:33,190 --> 02:26:34,290
I literally don't know how to...

2133
02:26:34,290 --> 02:26:35,850
Why did you waste my...

2134
02:26:35,850 --> 02:26:37,790
You did not need that bubble.

2135
02:26:38,530 --> 02:26:38,850
You...

2136
02:26:41,410 --> 02:26:44,710
You absolutely did not need that speed boost.

2137
02:26:47,090 --> 02:26:49,310
I think he's crazy.

2138
02:26:53,830 --> 02:26:55,130
He did not need...

2139
02:26:55,130 --> 02:26:55,970
Oh

2140
02:27:00,320 --> 02:27:02,420
my god.

2141
02:27:06,430 --> 02:27:07,410
There you go.

2142
02:27:11,030 --> 02:27:11,870
It's five.

2143
02:27:14,550 --> 02:27:15,250
Oh my god.

2144
02:27:15,510 --> 02:27:15,870
It's five.

2145
02:27:18,530 --> 02:27:19,290
We live.

2146
02:27:20,090 --> 02:27:20,910
I got the Luna.

2147
02:27:21,270 --> 02:27:24,630
There was no reason for me to but I got... I should swap.

2148
02:27:26,670 --> 02:27:28,150
I'll swap right now, actually.

2149
02:27:28,830 --> 02:27:29,550
I think I can.

2150
02:27:30,290 --> 02:27:31,070
I go swap.

2151
02:27:31,610 --> 02:27:32,570
I've stopped throwing.

2152
02:27:34,770 --> 02:27:36,870
I guess I'll play in this.

2153
02:27:37,730 --> 02:27:39,430
I know, I could play a joke for this, actually.

2154
02:27:40,810 --> 02:27:42,910
I think Arluna can, you know, heal this, right?

2155
02:27:43,730 --> 02:27:44,170
Yeah.

2156
02:27:48,790 --> 02:27:50,390
Oh, I believe.

2157
02:27:53,850 --> 02:27:56,250
Oh, I wanted to get the...

2158
02:27:56,250 --> 02:27:56,770
That's unlucky.

2159
02:27:57,370 --> 02:27:58,450
I thought I could get it.

2160
02:28:06,740 --> 02:28:07,540
Oh, my God.

2161
02:28:08,160 --> 02:28:08,920
That's unlucky.

2162
02:28:10,660 --> 02:28:11,500
We're five.

2163
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:16,060
We're so fine.

2164
02:28:16,920 --> 02:28:17,120
See?

2165
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:18,240
We're so healthy.

2166
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:23,660
We're so healthy.

2167
02:28:24,860 --> 02:28:24,960
See?

2168
02:28:25,220 --> 02:28:27,940
Wow, the game seems to get easier when I got off of Jeff.

2169
02:28:28,120 --> 02:28:29,020
That's crazy.

2170
02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:33,460
What a crazy concept.

2171
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:36,280
What a thought.

2172
02:28:36,760 --> 02:28:39,260
The game would get easier when I'm off of Jeff.

2173
02:28:39,820 --> 02:28:43,040
What an absolutely crazy concept.

2174
02:28:44,340 --> 02:28:44,700
No way.

2175
02:28:44,820 --> 02:28:46,000
It's like I'm actually playing characters.

2176
02:28:46,240 --> 02:28:46,920
I know how to play.

2177
02:28:48,420 --> 02:28:48,900
What?

2178
02:28:50,140 --> 02:28:52,140
Luna, I thought you were pushing the cart.

2179
02:28:54,480 --> 02:28:55,500
My team does.

2180
02:28:55,580 --> 02:28:58,320
I realize my team does not like pushing cart.

2181
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:02,240
This is the slowest.

2182
02:29:02,380 --> 02:29:05,320
Like, Luna, you can literally stand behind, stand on this.

2183
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:13,520
All right.

2184
02:29:13,640 --> 02:29:14,420
That's fine.

2185
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:15,960
last.

2186
02:29:18,220 --> 02:29:18,740
Jesus Christ.

2187
02:29:19,320 --> 02:29:19,960
I need to reload.

2188
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:20,980
Reload!

2189
02:29:21,780 --> 02:29:26,320
I'm gonna pull this fucker.

2190
02:29:28,260 --> 02:29:30,320
This is the only thing I can do.

2191
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:33,000
What?

2192
02:29:34,280 --> 02:29:35,860
Like, where is he?

2193
02:29:39,750 --> 02:29:40,870
Okay.

2194
02:29:42,310 --> 02:29:43,370
That's cool.

2195
02:29:44,110 --> 02:29:44,570
Please!

2196
02:29:45,010 --> 02:29:49,590
This... This way Mino is literally just peaking that for 20 years.

2197
02:29:49,890 --> 02:29:50,370
Just hit her.

2198
02:29:54,470 --> 02:29:56,290
Please just hit her.

2199
02:29:57,710 --> 02:29:59,950
Scylok, what are you shooting at?

2200
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:05,320
I don't know what our scylok was shooting.

2201
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:06,240
That's for sure.

2202
02:30:10,690 --> 02:30:11,350
I'm just getting in.

2203
02:30:16,350 --> 02:30:16,910

Of course the Angela is saying that.

Check the fucking bots.

02:34:22,870 --> 02:34:23,630
I didn't feel it.

2224
02:34:23,950 --> 02:34:26,550
I was like, our strange is so aggressive.

2225
02:34:28,990 --> 02:34:30,170
He is so aggressive.

2226
02:34:30,470 --> 02:34:30,950
Holy shit.

02:35:54,260 --> 02:35:54,740
Whoa.

2234
02:35:55,900 --> 02:35:56,280
Whoa.

2235
02:35:56,680 --> 02:35:57,580
I have to heal myself.

2236
02:35:58,320 --> 02:35:59,820
I can only trust myself.

2237
02:36:02,600 --> 02:36:03,260
All right.

2238
02:36:04,600 --> 02:36:05,200
It's fine.

2239
02:36:14,050 --> 02:36:15,350
How much did he charge?

2240
02:36:15,810 --> 02:36:16,370
Did he shoot?

2241
02:36:16,690 --> 02:36:18,590
He shot the entire hell.

2242
02:36:21,650 --> 02:36:22,610
He shot.

2243
02:36:24,590 --> 02:36:26,530
I don't know the real power of your life.

2244
02:36:26,970 --> 02:36:51,410
think i don't think cloak is the answer but whatever let this diamond angela player think she knows what's what's good i i legitimately don't think angela like cloak is the answer but we'll we'll let him think so there you go Look, this, the wolf has up.

2245
02:36:53,250 --> 02:36:54,030
Oh, wait, he...

2246
02:36:54,030 --> 02:36:55,770
He alts it!

2247
02:36:56,130 --> 02:36:57,430
I mean, sure.

2248
02:36:57,810 --> 02:36:58,510
I'll take that.

2249
02:36:59,550 --> 02:37:00,450
I'll take that.

2250
02:37:00,650 --> 02:37:02,490
He alts it into this.

2251
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:09,980
Sure.

2252
02:37:12,780 --> 02:37:14,300
I don't think Luke's the answer.

2253
02:37:14,460 --> 02:37:15,500
You know why I think that?

2254
02:37:15,780 --> 02:37:16,880
We don't have a mag.

2255
02:37:17,060 --> 02:37:21,320
So it's like, who's gonna shield me from their mag ult.

2256
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:23,380
That's the thing.

2257
02:37:25,240 --> 02:37:25,940
That's what I know.

2258
02:37:26,140 --> 02:37:27,380
This Angela has no brain.

2259
02:37:28,400 --> 02:37:30,540
Like, who the fuck is gonna shield me?

2260
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:37,080
And so I'm like, you're so stupid.

2261
02:37:37,620 --> 02:37:38,520
But I'll do it.

2262
02:37:38,740 --> 02:37:41,560
I'll do it because I'm here to prove to you that you don't know what you're seeing.

2263
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:43,940
Strange.

2264
02:37:44,140 --> 02:37:48,060
The thing is, I have to make it so that I alt near the strange.

2265
02:37:48,180 --> 02:37:48,600
Oh, there we go.

2266
02:37:48,680 --> 02:37:49,620
Now we have, thank God.

2267
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:52,840
Now, now we have him back.

2268
02:37:53,140 --> 02:37:53,360
Thank God.

2269
02:37:53,660 --> 02:37:54,440
Okay, I was going to sit.

2270
02:37:55,160 --> 02:37:55,380
I don't know.

2271
02:37:55,540 --> 02:37:56,300
What the...

2272
02:37:56,300 --> 02:37:56,940
What?

2273
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:58,860
What was he?

2274
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:00,140
Okay, it has to be a headshot.

2275
02:38:00,340 --> 02:38:00,720
I was going to sit.

2276
02:38:04,360 --> 02:38:06,040
I had this done.

2277
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:12,500
Good.

2278
02:38:13,120 --> 02:38:14,000
I blinded him.

2279
02:38:16,660 --> 02:38:17,580
Alright, good luck.

2280
02:38:20,740 --> 02:38:21,700
Okay, there you go.

2281
02:38:23,780 --> 02:38:25,700
Thank God he did an instant slam dunk.

2282
02:38:25,820 --> 02:38:26,660
I was so scared.

2283
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:29,200
I was so scared of the instant slam dunk.

2284
02:38:30,680 --> 02:38:30,700
Shield.

2285
02:38:30,800 --> 02:38:33,120
Yeah, who was going to shield it by my thoughts and prayers?

2286
02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:38,680
Yeah, I'm just not going to peek.

2287
02:38:40,400 --> 02:38:42,320
I can't hurt me when I'm behind a wall.

2288
02:38:42,760 --> 02:38:43,660
Okay, Punisher.

2289
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:46,000
Alright.

2290
02:38:46,620 --> 02:38:47,380
He doesn't care.

2291
02:38:49,160 --> 02:38:49,460
Yeah.

2292
02:38:50,580 --> 02:38:51,960
You know, it is a little silly.

2293
02:38:56,680 --> 02:38:57,840
Oh My

2294
02:39:01,770 --> 02:39:05,150
I'm just gonna make sure where the fuck is this club going?

2295
02:39:07,090 --> 02:39:08,330
Where the fuck is our Angela?

2296
02:39:10,890 --> 02:39:18,850
Angela, please look at me Oh my oh Oh, nice.

2297
02:39:19,010 --> 02:39:19,890
That's fine.

2298
02:39:20,450 --> 02:39:20,770
Oh nice.

2299
02:39:21,130 --> 02:39:22,030
I mean, that's okay

2300
02:39:28,660 --> 02:39:31,480
Wee That's okay.

2301
02:39:33,140 --> 02:39:33,880
It's okay.

2302
02:39:33,980 --> 02:39:34,780
I killed somebody.

2303
02:39:35,220 --> 02:39:35,600
All right.

2304
02:39:36,340 --> 02:39:37,300
Oh my, okay.

2305
02:39:37,460 --> 02:39:37,820
We're fine.

2306
02:39:37,980 --> 02:39:39,000
We're so healthy.

2307
02:39:39,460 --> 02:39:41,400
We're so slow.

2308
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:42,760
I'm so slow.

2309
02:39:42,760 --> 02:39:44,180
I'm so slow, but we're making it.

2310
02:39:44,900 --> 02:39:46,060
We're making it.

2311
02:39:47,660 --> 02:39:49,400
That was a good reaction time for Marluna.

2312
02:39:50,260 --> 02:39:51,060
That truly is.

2313
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:54,100
That was close.

2314
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:55,820
That was so close.

2315
02:39:56,240 --> 02:39:56,780
Thank God.

2316
02:39:58,640 --> 02:39:58,860
Don't worry.

2317
02:39:58,920 --> 02:39:59,680
Simple geometry.

2318
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:33,280
watch watch this look at that i hit that wall and it heals my team jesus all right it's okay so many widow players in this era oh my god please please please no no i'm alive we have reset he has reset but it's oh he's dead he's look dead he's so dead there you go i know i could have healed him but i wanted that kill

2319
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:57,160
holy shit okay i feel like there's so many widows in this elo i feel like i've never seen widow they must be like hard stuck around this area because i've i've never seen this many this many widows before back to back.

2320
02:40:57,300 --> 02:41:00,120
Or maybe they just play D-Gen now or so they don't get yelled at.

2321
02:41:04,200 --> 02:41:05,560
I'm gonna avoid the widow.

2322
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:08,420
It was pretty bad.

2323
02:41:13,270 --> 02:41:14,050
It was so much...

2324
02:41:14,050 --> 02:41:15,490
Yeah, I feel like I got like...

2325
02:41:15,490 --> 02:41:21,730
I think like 80% of my games had a widow player which is very high amount.

2326
02:41:23,010 --> 02:41:30,430
Because when I was grinding last season, like I see like Maybe, like, I think I saw one widow.

2327
02:41:32,130 --> 02:41:33,490
This is your safe space.

2328
02:41:33,770 --> 02:41:35,030
This Elo's your safe space.

2329
02:41:35,330 --> 02:41:37,090
I was going to go, key, I'll be right back.

2330
02:42:35,960 --> 02:42:36,880
And I'm back.

2331
02:42:37,060 --> 02:42:38,700
Oh, oh yeah, I was going to show you guys my Jeff hours.

2332
02:42:40,360 --> 02:42:41,000
Let's see.

2333
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:44,440
Uh...

2334
02:42:50,790 --> 02:42:51,670
All season.

2335
02:42:52,630 --> 02:42:53,510
One point.

2336
02:42:55,450 --> 02:42:58,590
Guys, I have had one...

2337
02:42:58,610 --> 02:43:09,870
point eight hours on just jeff and i'm pretty sure 90 of that was literally this season it's

2338
02:43:13,940 --> 02:43:33,000
i'm pretty sure it was from this season like when he said win rate good time to up this number i told you i don't play jeff i'm literally learning this season i'm learning him this season right now.

2339
02:43:37,400 --> 02:43:39,080
I told you.

2340
02:43:42,700 --> 02:43:43,800
What the fuck?

2341
02:43:43,980 --> 02:43:46,180
Why do they have 4GM players?

2342
02:43:48,820 --> 02:43:49,740
That's not fair.

2343
02:43:52,420 --> 02:43:53,460
I think I'd be mad at it.

2344
02:43:53,580 --> 02:43:55,480
I was like, guys, I still won.

2345
02:43:56,300 --> 02:44:02,080
I might have, okay, I might have swapped off Jeff when I needed to, but I still won.

2346
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:03,820
Technically, I'm not throwing.

2347
02:44:03,840 --> 02:44:24,660
because we won i'm banning torch fuck that shit what's up oh well um here we go

2348
02:44:32,480 --> 02:44:46,480
oh we're both bad torch uh i'll ban emma no one does no if no one's playing emma i'm banning emma oh magic that's interesting i really don't see a lot of magic players in this Elo.

2349
02:44:56,720 --> 02:44:59,100
Should have gave me the ban!

2350
02:45:00,900 --> 02:45:01,660
It is strong.

2351
02:45:01,940 --> 02:45:05,340
She's very strong in pro play.

2352
02:45:06,580 --> 02:45:08,580
But I don't see it in this Elo.

2353
02:45:10,220 --> 02:45:10,980
Very often.

2354
02:45:12,260 --> 02:45:12,760
I don't know.

2355
02:45:13,180 --> 02:45:14,300
Do I have to be in Luna Jela?

2356
02:45:14,380 --> 02:45:16,700
Are you Shay and Karoti?

2357
02:45:18,380 --> 02:45:18,940
Ugh.

2358
02:45:19,140 --> 02:45:19,380
Fine.

2359
02:45:19,500 --> 02:45:20,020
I'll play Luna.

2360
02:45:20,220 --> 02:45:22,700
I was gonna say, oh, do I be in Luna jail?

2361
02:45:23,620 --> 02:45:26,940
Or do I play a character at... Do I want to play something different?

2362
02:45:31,820 --> 02:45:32,100
Oh.

2363
02:45:34,780 --> 02:45:36,200
Oh, did they Q-Dodge?

2364
02:45:37,420 --> 02:45:38,100
Did they dodge?

2365
02:45:38,600 --> 02:45:39,000
Oh.

2366
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:40,660
Oh, they dodged.

2367
02:45:41,140 --> 02:45:42,560
Oh, I guess he didn't want to play support.

2368
02:45:43,920 --> 02:45:44,980
They're like, fuck this.

2369
02:45:45,440 --> 02:45:46,100
Fuck this shit.

2370
02:45:46,300 --> 02:45:46,360
I'm done.

2371
02:45:46,600 --> 02:45:49,020
There's like basically no penalties for Q-Dodge.

2372
02:45:49,180 --> 02:45:51,400
I feel like the penalty... Oh, no, he didn't.

2373
02:45:51,420 --> 02:45:51,940
He came back.

2374
02:45:51,980 --> 02:45:52,460
God damn it.

2375
02:45:52,460 --> 02:45:53,180
He should Q-Dodge.

2376
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:55,260
But like... I...

2377
02:45:55,280 --> 02:46:27,060
honestly feel like there's not a lot of q like not oh wow okay i wish he did left i wish he never came back if he has got like 50 ps um um uh but like you don't really get bad for q dodging okay if i'm solo healing um i have to i have to chop off my hands Because this is,

2378
02:46:27,060 --> 02:46:29,780
like, literally the only character you can play for solo heroes.

2379
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:30,760
This sucks.

2380
02:46:32,780 --> 02:46:33,960
See, I'm still trying.

2381
02:46:35,620 --> 02:46:37,240
I'm still trying.

2382
02:46:38,300 --> 02:46:39,980
I'm still at least trying.

2383
02:46:42,740 --> 02:46:43,060
Yay.

2384
02:46:45,500 --> 02:46:46,020
Yay.

2385
02:46:47,300 --> 02:46:49,280
Of course, my team with the...

2386
02:46:50,560 --> 02:46:53,300
Okay, they're running Mantis, Jeff, guys.

2387
02:46:55,280 --> 02:47:20,660
was aimbotting what how did it literally it was it was one shot one shot and already calling aimbot is he actually why can't i have like like an actual real game what the fuck is he actually fully.

2388
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:21,200
Burning?

2389
02:47:26,980 --> 02:47:29,980
Well, these are streaming and I mean, I could get banned fast.

2390
02:47:30,320 --> 02:47:31,380
Wait, I can message...

2391
02:47:31,380 --> 02:47:31,960
Wait, actually, no.

2392
02:47:32,100 --> 02:47:33,500
They don't handle bans.

2393
02:47:33,640 --> 02:47:36,100
I was gonna say, I can message my devs.

2394
02:47:36,540 --> 02:47:36,560
Right?

2395
02:47:37,940 --> 02:47:38,560
But I forgot.

2396
02:47:38,720 --> 02:47:39,500
They don't handle cheats.

2397
02:47:39,900 --> 02:47:41,400
Wait, what do we need to do about that?

2398
02:47:41,700 --> 02:47:43,840
What if I... Wait, okay, wait, wait.

2399
02:47:44,280 --> 02:47:49,840
Actually, actually, I can message them and be like, can they cancel this match right now and get this banned live?

2400
02:47:51,700 --> 02:47:53,620
Grungo, I'm bad at this, Matt.

2401
02:47:54,240 --> 02:47:55,780
Oh, okay, wait, I'm messaging.

2402
02:47:56,480 --> 02:47:57,860
Do you guys do live?

2403
02:47:59,260 --> 02:48:02,760
Do you guys do live vans?

2404
02:48:03,220 --> 02:48:08,620
Because there's a winner cheating in my game right now.

2405
02:48:10,060 --> 02:48:11,140
I'm like, hold on.

2406
02:48:11,700 --> 02:48:12,540

2413
02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:47,020

2414
02:48:53,420 --> 02:49:48,490

2415
02:49:52,350 --> 02:49:55,930

2416
02:49:56,450 --> 02:49:57,870

02:49:58,390 --> 02:49:59,530
No, that's...

2418
02:49:59,530 --> 02:50:02,110
I know they said he's cheating!

2419
02:50:02,950 --> 02:50:04,430
They said he's cheating!

2420
02:50:05,170 --> 02:50:06,970
My teammates said he's cheating and I figured...

2421
02:50:07,370 --> 02:50:08,690
Why would they lie to me?

2422
02:50:09,590 --> 02:50:10,990
Why would they lie?

2423
02:50:11,570 --> 02:50:13,910
That's so fucked up if they lied.

2424
02:50:15,170 --> 02:50:16,570
We are undefeatable!

2425
02:50:22,330 --> 02:50:24,490
I mean, it could be a new account.

2426
02:50:24,510 --> 02:50:26,170
Yeah, that they're ranking up.

2427
02:50:30,410 --> 02:50:31,650
I'm in 2D.

2428
02:50:32,410 --> 02:50:38,350
I might have got one guide.

2429
02:50:38,570 --> 02:50:40,470
I don't even know how many people we're seeing is hacking.

2430
02:50:42,890 --> 02:50:46,810
Look, my defense is that I was just listening to my team.

2431
02:50:50,470 --> 02:50:54,150
I already launched a missile before I fact-checked.

2432
02:50:54,510 --> 02:50:56,790
I was like, he's cheating?

2433
02:50:57,550 --> 02:50:58,740
That's all I need.

2434
02:51:03,530 --> 02:51:04,250
See?

2435
02:51:05,950 --> 02:51:09,270
I guess I can't backtrack.

2436
02:51:15,790 --> 02:51:19,990
I also, I very easily succumb to peer pressure.

2437
02:51:22,150 --> 02:51:23,530
At Grock is yacking.

2438
02:51:25,450 --> 02:51:26,430
It's...

2439
02:51:27,790 --> 02:51:28,750

02:51:33,670 --> 02:51:34,310
Wait!

2443
02:51:35,130 --> 02:51:36,030

2444
02:51:36,070 --> 02:51:38,070
Is he a hacker or is he a criminal?

2445
02:51:38,650 --> 02:51:39,570
What is he?

2446
02:51:42,530 --> 02:51:46,010

you can't expect We did have a second healer.

2456
02:54:05,240 --> 02:54:07,360
He was just not really there.

2457
02:54:09,980 --> 02:54:11,520
I don't know what he's yapping about.

2458
02:54:16,260 --> 02:54:17,580
Oh, I mean, I didn't lose that.

2459
02:54:18,220 --> 02:54:21,360
I think it's just because, like, I was supposed to be in this.

2460
02:54:21,460 --> 02:54:22,260
Alright, let's look.

2461
02:54:23,060 --> 02:54:23,740
I don't know.

2462
02:54:23,900 --> 02:54:24,660
Let's just look.

2463
02:54:25,460 --> 02:54:25,860
History.

2464
02:54:29,360 --> 02:54:31,840
He doesn't even have that many final hits.

2465
02:54:35,210 --> 02:54:35,930
Yeah, he's not...

2466
02:54:35,930 --> 02:54:36,570
This is not even...

2467
02:54:36,590 --> 02:54:38,530
Oh my gosh, I might have sent a nuke accidentally.

2468
02:54:42,490 --> 02:54:45,110
I'm not sure if he is hacking.

2469
02:54:45,610 --> 02:54:49,190
If he was hacking.

2470
02:54:49,670 --> 02:54:51,830
Just my teammates were saying it.

2471
02:54:53,550 --> 02:54:54,710
Well, I'm straight.

2472
02:54:56,450 --> 02:54:57,630
Oh, bye.

2473
02:55:00,470 --> 02:55:03,710
I said like, I was like, okay, I'm not that straight.

2474
02:55:08,670 --> 02:55:11,250
I think I might have got one guy.

2475
02:55:11,470 --> 02:55:12,710
Because I was like, bro, is he not?

2476
02:55:12,950 --> 02:55:15,250
I don't know if it was a smurf, then I understand.

2477
02:55:15,690 --> 02:55:21,110
But, like, I'm anti-airing.

2478
02:55:21,230 --> 02:55:22,290
We have anti-air.

2479
02:55:22,470 --> 02:55:25,430
We went one guy in game.

2480
02:55:28,330 --> 02:55:32,070
The dev was like, our team is looking into it if he is hacking.

2481
02:55:34,250 --> 02:55:36,570
Look, if he did get bad, then...

2482
02:55:36,590 --> 02:55:39,250
Then, then, we didn't get one guy.

2483
02:55:40,610 --> 02:55:41,170
Alright, let's see.

2484
02:55:51,080 --> 02:55:51,920
Okay.

2485
02:55:52,780 --> 02:55:54,440
That was a...

2486
02:55:54,440 --> 02:55:55,620
Wait a minute.

2487
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:58,740
That shot was crazy.

2488
02:55:59,160 --> 02:55:59,460
Okay.

2489
02:56:00,240 --> 02:56:03,540
That was a crazy shot.

2490
02:56:04,120 --> 02:56:05,260
Holy shit.

2491
02:56:05,400 --> 02:56:07,400
Okay, let's check that again.

2492
02:56:07,560 --> 02:56:08,380
Let's...

2493
02:56:08,380 --> 02:56:09,720
Alright.

2494
02:56:16,970 --> 02:56:29,030
That was actually a quick he wasn't scoped in that's the thing Like what the fuck What he wasn't even

2495
02:56:40,280 --> 02:56:41,800
Was he typing?

2496
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:58,600
I think he was typing there That was crazy I think he was typing For that okay are you see why All right, here's another shot.

2497
02:56:58,840 --> 02:57:02,340
I can see why they thought he was hacking.

2498
02:57:02,680 --> 02:57:04,420
Because that shot was insane.

2499
02:57:07,220 --> 02:57:10,220
Like, that guy was crazy with that.

2500
02:57:12,800 --> 02:57:14,100
I just gotta know.

2501
02:57:16,080 --> 02:57:17,260
Like, he has good aim.

2502
02:57:17,400 --> 02:57:18,220
That's not crazy.

2503
02:57:18,320 --> 02:57:19,420
That's just a normal shot.

2504
02:57:23,500 --> 02:57:25,440
That was just a very normal widow shot.

2505
02:57:27,140 --> 02:57:32,900
It's just that first 30 seconds was, insane all

2506
02:57:36,660 --> 02:57:52,520
right wait does he do another kill okay this is where he killed me because i was standing still oh that's i yeah i was really jumping it was so telegraphed and there's another one i mean he's missing like he's whipping

2507
02:57:57,210 --> 02:58:34,550
i can't tell i legitimately cannot tell who's got better guns now i just think this one was crazy this was the crazy one right here like that one was just such an insane shot like the rest of one was just was just like they're good it's good it's a good shot all right okay they haven't i haven't said anything I don't know I don't know

2508
02:58:38,330 --> 02:59:05,110
alright I just don't want to cue into them that's for sure look if he gets bad then I was right if he doesn't then like then like we I defended myself to the desk I was like I'm not sure later on I was like I told the desk they're like oh we're looking into it to see if he's acting I was like my team said they're hacking so i'm not sure

Let the record show.

2516
03:01:15,990 --> 03:01:17,850
Read off the transcript.

2517
03:01:19,530 --> 03:01:21,930
Why the... Bro, I'm just Jeff!

2518
03:01:30,830 --> 03:01:38,990
Yes, I reported him because I did so in the face that my teammate wasn't that.

2519
03:01:40,970 --> 03:01:42,550
Hey, yeah.

2520
03:01:42,750 --> 03:01:43,770
Oh, he left.

2521
03:01:44,370 --> 03:01:45,110
He came.

2522
03:01:46,890 --> 03:01:50,230
It was like, fuck this piano bullshit.

2523
03:01:50,550 --> 03:01:52,270
No, I almost killed him.

2524
03:01:56,010 --> 03:01:57,440
I almost killed him.

2525
03:02:05,280 --> 03:02:07,160
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

2526
03:02:08,380 --> 03:02:08,800
Alright.

2527
03:02:09,780 --> 03:02:11,540
I love my Insta-Pick DPS.

2528
03:02:12,660 --> 03:02:13,880
That's my favorite part.

2529
03:02:14,940 --> 03:02:16,020
And then they see a Jeff.

2530
03:02:19,840 --> 03:02:23,260
Now, who am I going to banish from this match?

2531
03:02:24,380 --> 03:02:28,400
like so much so much confidence

2532
03:02:33,090 --> 03:02:43,490
I bet they feel what the fuck are these bands I swear to God if they don't ban Torch right after I swear to God if I have to deal with Torch I would be angry

2533
03:02:47,030 --> 03:02:49,950
both hugs what the fuck is this you know

2534
03:02:54,310 --> 03:02:58,130
I swear to God there's no way you would Counter my bad.

2535
03:02:58,650 --> 03:03:01,350
There's no way you three want to play against the torch.

2536
03:03:01,650 --> 03:03:02,670
There's no fucking way.

2537
03:03:02,770 --> 03:03:03,590
Don't be stupid.

2538
03:03:04,410 --> 03:03:06,410
They fucking try to counter this bad.

2539
03:03:08,470 --> 03:03:09,270
Oh my god.

2540
03:03:09,590 --> 03:03:11,530
What is wrong with you two?

2541
03:03:11,950 --> 03:03:12,150
What?

2542
03:03:15,550 --> 03:03:16,870
Oh, thank God.

2543
03:03:17,050 --> 03:03:18,070
Thank fucking God.

2544
03:03:18,090 --> 03:03:19,990
I was going to say, what is wrong with you two?

2545
03:03:20,150 --> 03:03:22,770
Why would you ever want to play against the torch?

2546
03:03:28,470 --> 03:03:30,250
Like, yeah, we have a spidey.

2547
03:03:30,470 --> 03:03:32,610
I don't trust my spider to kill this torch.

2548
03:03:33,010 --> 03:03:35,110
It's not even, like, it doesn't matter if he counters.

2549
03:03:35,270 --> 03:03:36,050
It's just not fun.

2550
03:03:37,010 --> 03:03:39,270
Hey, would you let me play Jeff?

2551
03:03:39,950 --> 03:03:40,350
Yay!

2552
03:03:46,970 --> 03:03:50,290
I know our torch could, like, counter it, but it's still not fun.

2553
03:03:50,430 --> 03:03:51,190
It doesn't matter.

2554
03:03:56,920 --> 03:03:57,920
It doesn't matter.

2555
03:03:58,080 --> 03:04:00,840
I just don't find torch fun to play with or against.

2556
03:04:01,460 --> 03:04:05,460
Because if we don't have a torch player, it's even more miserable.

2557
03:04:07,060 --> 03:04:07,380
I don't.

2558
03:04:09,860 --> 03:04:10,820
Chomp, chomp.

2559
03:04:11,280 --> 03:04:12,240
Are you like...

2560
03:04:12,240 --> 03:04:12,860
All right, Luna.

2561
03:04:18,100 --> 03:04:20,060
Thought I'd get some munchies in.

2562
03:04:20,380 --> 03:04:22,600
Thought I'd get some motivation in.

2563
03:04:25,120 --> 03:04:26,000
You wanna follow me?

2564
03:04:26,400 --> 03:04:26,960
I'm gonna go around.

2565
03:04:27,340 --> 03:04:28,580
He does not even...

2566
03:04:28,580 --> 03:04:28,700
Oh.

2567
03:04:29,060 --> 03:04:31,500
And then I'll give us shield so we're not stopping the vlogger.

2568
03:04:34,820 --> 03:04:35,300
Freekeeper.

2569
03:04:35,640 --> 03:04:36,720
Hey, she...

2570
03:04:39,680 --> 03:04:43,240
This fucking strange stat is getting to my nerves.

2571
03:04:43,560 --> 03:04:46,220
Okay, so I don't think this is a winnable team.

2572
03:04:47,020 --> 03:04:51,560
I don't think my...

2573
03:04:51,560 --> 03:04:56,880
I don't think my team is the winnable team, the winning team, guys.

2574
03:04:57,080 --> 03:05:01,200
After that, this does not give me any hope at all.

2575
03:05:05,870 --> 03:05:07,020
Oh my god.

2576
03:05:08,100 --> 03:05:09,100
Divers died.

2577
03:05:09,440 --> 03:05:10,620
What the fuck?

2578
03:05:10,960 --> 03:05:11,960
Three people?

2579
03:05:12,420 --> 03:05:17,620
Three people were like on us and our divers all died.

2580
03:05:17,880 --> 03:05:19,040
That's crazy.

2581
03:05:19,380 --> 03:05:20,380
Yeah, I'm going completely.

2582
03:05:24,360 --> 03:05:26,240
My mom's trying to save you.

2583
03:05:26,940 --> 03:05:30,260
Oh my god, I'm doing my best to save your life right now.

2584
03:05:30,720 --> 03:05:31,700
Both support are dead.

2585
03:05:31,880 --> 03:05:32,660
Both support are dead.

2586
03:05:33,440 --> 03:05:34,900
There we go.

2587
03:05:37,660 --> 03:05:39,000
Oh, what the fuck?

2588
03:05:40,720 --> 03:05:42,320
Where the fuck is this?

2589
03:05:42,820 --> 03:05:45,240
Stay around me, stay around me, I'm gonna give this to you.

2590
03:05:46,920 --> 03:05:49,740
I was gonna say, where the fuck was the spider, Matt?

2591
03:05:50,660 --> 03:05:51,300
There we go.

2592
03:05:53,560 --> 03:05:55,540

No way, dude.

2608
03:07:03,420 --> 03:07:04,520

2610
03:07:08,540 --> 03:07:09,620
That's fucking required.

2611
03:07:09,720 --> 03:07:10,180
I got a shield.

2612
03:07:10,240 --> 03:07:11,620
That Bucky got caught.

03:07:12,940 --> 03:07:13,720

03:07:14,320 --> 03:07:16,940
Wait, I was like, did the squirrel girl come from?

2615
03:07:18,840 --> 03:07:20,080
I fucked up.

2616
03:07:21,220 --> 03:07:22,100
We pushed her a lot, though.

2617
03:07:22,680 --> 03:07:24,200
I don't even know who said that.

2618
03:07:24,240 --> 03:07:25,500
Who said that?

2619
03:07:25,860 --> 03:07:26,300
Holy shit.

2620
03:07:27,340 --> 03:07:29,020
I just, uh, regroup right now.

2621
03:07:29,440 --> 03:07:31,840
There was nothing I could, uh, I didn't know who to, uh, at that point.

2622
03:07:33,460 --> 03:07:34,720
Who said that?

2623
03:07:35,320 --> 03:07:36,580
Bro, and he has CTV!

2624
03:07:36,860 --> 03:07:37,940

2627
03:08:11,160 --> 03:08:12,620
They're not even looking at you.

2628
03:08:13,500 --> 03:08:15,000
We're causing a lot of damage.

2629
03:08:15,160 --> 03:08:16,460
That's crazy.

2630
03:08:17,220 --> 03:08:18,400
All right, I should swap.

2631
03:08:19,300 --> 03:08:20,400
Let's see if you just score, girl.

2632
03:08:21,540 --> 03:08:24,680
Oh, I just realized it does look a little squeaky squeaky.

2633
03:08:26,020 --> 03:08:26,820
Weir, weir, weir.

2634
03:08:29,120 --> 03:08:32,140
I mean, we are fucking DPS lineup is literally melee.

03:08:32,720 --> 03:08:37,320
Like we have, we have no like range.

2636
03:08:38,580 --> 03:08:39,420
It's literally melee.

03:08:39,560 --> 03:08:40,100
Just walk up.

2638
03:08:40,140 --> 03:08:40,960

03:10:13,520 --> 03:10:15,440
Oh my god, okay, that's fine.

2656
03:10:15,660 --> 03:10:16,940
I was gonna tell you not to kill him.

2657
03:10:17,060 --> 03:10:17,820
Yeah, I'm not getting any better.

2658
03:10:18,880 --> 03:10:19,460
It didn't matter.

2659
03:10:19,500 --> 03:10:21,900
I used it before he... Okay, now I can swap.

2660
03:10:22,640 --> 03:10:23,140

2661
03:10:23,140 --> 03:10:23,580
I'll swap Cloak.

2662
03:10:25,560 --> 03:10:25,920
Uh...

2663
03:10:26,940 --> 03:10:28,040
Maybe... Maybe Invis.

2664
03:10:28,560 --> 03:10:28,920
Actually.

2665
03:10:29,500 --> 03:10:31,360
I don't know actually which would be the best.

2666
03:10:31,940 --> 03:10:33,080
Uh, right above you guys.

2667
03:10:33,100 --> 03:10:33,620
He's right above you.

2668
03:10:33,680 --> 03:10:34,420
Strange they're gonna ult you.

2669
03:10:34,780 --> 03:10:35,260
All right.

2670
03:10:36,980 --> 03:10:39,260
But what if he doesn't ult me?

2671
03:10:41,120 --> 03:10:42,920
No, it's just that I can't, uh...

2672
03:10:43,500 --> 03:10:45,340
I won't be able to help, uh...

2673
03:10:45,340 --> 03:11:05,360

2674
03:11:06,240 --> 03:11:17,500
Okay, Luna, another He doesn't play support, you can tell he doesn't play support Because he runs away from me feel threatened we're supposed to stick together

2675
03:11:20,680 --> 03:11:49,320
that's what like that's like like that's when you know like if they don't do that they don't know they've never played support before they're supposed okay also that Squirrel Go should not be that much of a threat but we literally have like our team is literally all melee we have zero project like zero projectiles I made a roll on the roll.

2676
03:11:51,960 --> 03:11:52,760
Please.

2677
03:11:54,040 --> 03:11:54,400
Please.

2678
03:11:56,480 --> 03:11:58,380
Shoot the squirrel girl!

2679
03:11:59,220 --> 03:12:06,320
In fact, I'm literally the only one to shoot it, just because...

2680
03:12:06,320 --> 03:12:08,120
Just because I was Jeff.

2681
03:12:09,320 --> 03:12:09,800
That...

2682
03:12:10,340 --> 03:12:11,780
That is so sad.

2683
03:12:12,620 --> 03:12:13,280
There you go.

2684
03:12:15,780 --> 03:12:17,740
Oh my god, lift, man.

2685
03:12:17,760 --> 03:12:18,240
That's good.

2686
03:12:22,440 --> 03:12:23,740
I'm trying my best.

2687
03:12:24,080 --> 03:12:25,560
I'm trying my best to keep up.

2688
03:12:26,340 --> 03:12:27,760
I don't have anything.

2689
03:12:40,700 --> 03:12:44,120
Are you serious?

2690
03:12:45,260 --> 03:12:49,260
We literally had this Loki right behind us, but we didn't care.

2691
03:12:54,210 --> 03:12:55,230
There's nothing I could do.

2692
03:12:55,490 --> 03:13:00,170
i actually have to oh my god they saw me they blocked me up

2693
03:13:05,740 --> 03:13:59,860
it's not me i just assume i just think our i just think our other support doesn't know how to play support but they almost have my all i can't do any tp oh he jumped off time to switch things up person's a dps player he's failing on angela i'm not the type who fades quietly into the background the right heroes could make all the difference the fact that my entire team are melee players so we have no one to shoot anything the fact that i as jeff was the only thing shooting the squirrel girl which was very sad No,

2694
03:14:00,080 --> 03:14:01,360
they swapped off Angela.

2695
03:14:01,640 --> 03:14:03,080
I don't know what to play for this.

2696
03:14:05,060 --> 03:14:05,860
They're running...

2697
03:14:05,860 --> 03:14:07,600
They're running Squirrel, girl.

2698
03:14:08,520 --> 03:14:09,700
I guess I have to play Luna.

2699
03:14:09,880 --> 03:14:11,060
God damn, I have to be on Luna jail.

2700
03:14:11,480 --> 03:14:13,360
Just because I need a...

2701
03:14:13,360 --> 03:14:14,600
We need Luna for this.

2702
03:14:23,020 --> 03:14:23,420
Um...

2703
03:14:23,420 --> 03:14:25,380
Just because, like, our Spider-Man needs...

2704
03:14:25,380 --> 03:14:26,880
I like how...

2705
03:14:26,880 --> 03:14:28,960
Hey, Spider-Man, do you not want your fucking pop?

2706
03:14:29,060 --> 03:14:30,180
There you go.

2707
03:14:30,260 --> 03:14:30,600
There you go.

2708
03:14:30,640 --> 03:14:34,740
My audience isn't really into Moody songs about guys who wear horns.

2709
03:14:35,340 --> 03:14:35,860
Sucks.

2710
03:14:36,740 --> 03:14:37,620
I wish we had.

2711
03:14:37,800 --> 03:14:41,180
I wish we had someone that goes pew pew pew pew.

2712
03:14:44,160 --> 03:14:44,680
Yeah.

2713
03:14:45,880 --> 03:14:47,100
Three, two, one.

2714
03:14:48,540 --> 03:14:50,920
You have to stop them from securing the mission area.

2715
03:14:51,540 --> 03:14:52,020
All right.

2716
03:14:52,620 --> 03:14:54,280
Will we stop them though?

2717
03:14:55,520 --> 03:14:56,720
Will we stop them?

2718
03:14:58,040 --> 03:14:59,040
That's a good question.

2719
03:14:59,060 --> 03:15:25,440
question because this squirrel girl should not be a threat the fact that she is means my team is not good it's the fact that it just means my team is actually pretty bad because she should not have that much of an impact at all they're hitting me they're hitting me i'm walking back i'm walking

2720
03:15:29,140 --> 03:15:30,200
Back on you guys.

2721
03:15:31,260 --> 03:15:33,060
Oh my god, I have to use that.

2722
03:15:33,400 --> 03:15:34,400
Guys, please.

2723
03:15:34,520 --> 03:15:36,520
Oh, that's a good up.

2724
03:15:36,920 --> 03:15:38,040
Trade, trade, trade, trade.

2725
03:15:38,220 --> 03:15:41,200
You popped your passive?

2726
03:15:41,780 --> 03:15:42,260
How?

2727
03:15:44,020 --> 03:15:50,780
What do you mean what is that?

2728
03:15:50,840 --> 03:15:52,280
I love!

2729
03:15:55,340 --> 03:15:56,680
Please, please shoot it!

2730
03:15:56,820 --> 03:15:57,820
Please shoot it!

2731
03:15:58,120 --> 03:15:59,360

I'll get him.

2749
03:17:33,650 --> 03:17:34,930
We're still holding front lines.

2750
03:17:35,170 --> 03:17:36,150
Why can't...

2751
03:17:36,150 --> 03:17:36,770
Why?

2752
03:17:37,370 --> 03:17:38,230
Why can't they?

2753
03:17:39,210 --> 03:17:41,830
Why can't they shoot one?

2754
03:17:44,690 --> 03:17:47,150
Really, that's all they need to do.

2755

That's all they need to do.

2756
03:17:55,150 --> 03:17:58,630

I'm just thinking literally all they had to do is shoot the squirrel girl.

2765
03:19:06,220 --> 03:19:14,760
That's all they have to do like I feel like I was the only one shooting it Please!

Shoot the alt!

2770
03:19:25,920 --> 03:19:28,360
She has zero impact if you shoot it!

2771
03:19:28,800 --> 03:19:30,640
It's not that difficult!

2772
03:19:30,980 --> 03:19:31,640

2773
03:19:32,280 --> 03:19:33,340

It's crazy.

2778
03:19:43,260 --> 03:19:49,580
It's like the most simple solution yet none of us can comprehend it Here we go.

2779
03:19:49,580 --> 03:19:53,560
You walk in Oh my god

Oh my god, I forgot He is immune to that.

2783
03:20:16,660 --> 03:20:21,040
I fucking, I froze him and then my team wakes him up.

2784
03:20:28,120 --> 03:20:31,760
I can't, this team, this team is way too special.

2785
03:20:32,220 --> 03:20:35,620
Oh my god, please, a body block, body block so he doesn't get grabbed.

2786
03:20:35,860 --> 03:20:37,700

03:20:38,760 --> 03:20:39,680

2791
03:21:14,880 --> 03:21:15,700
You know what's gonna happen?

2792
03:21:16,480 --> 03:21:19,280
I'm gonna die to a squirrel girl because we don't shoot the up.

2793
03:21:19,760 --> 03:21:20,920
I got you, I got you.

2794
03:21:21,580 --> 03:21:22,500
I can feel it.

2795
03:21:22,700 --> 03:21:24,140
I'm not standing here in my support.

2796
03:21:26,740 --> 03:21:29,900
I can feel the squirrel girl right here.

2797
03:21:30,020 --> 03:21:30,840
I'll leave you for it.

2798
03:21:33,180 --> 03:21:34,180
That's gonna be TP.

2799
03:21:37,660 --> 03:21:38,440
Target square though.

2800
03:21:42,340 --> 03:21:43,500
I'm staying in here.

2801
03:21:44,420 --> 03:21:45,460
I'm staying here.

2802
03:21:46,280 --> 03:21:48,660
Oh, yes, I shouldn't have stayed in there.

2803
03:21:50,960 --> 03:21:54,700
I thought it was a safe space.

2804
03:21:56,860 --> 03:21:58,300
It was not a safe space.

2805
03:22:01,640 --> 03:22:03,100
Guys, it was not a safe...

2806
03:22:03,100 --> 03:22:04,600
Yay, we did it!

2807
03:22:08,740 --> 03:22:09,940
We did it.

2808
03:22:10,280 --> 03:22:13,780
We did not deserve to win this, but we did this.

2809
03:22:14,220 --> 03:22:14,940
We did it.

2810
03:22:15,860 --> 03:22:17,380
I don't know.

2811
03:22:17,780 --> 03:22:23,220
I was crashing out so hard because I felt like no one shot the alt.

2812
03:22:23,740 --> 03:22:28,840
It was the one time anyone shot the alt was me as Jeff because I was just spitting at it.

2813
03:22:29,780 --> 03:22:31,120
We didn't deserve that win.

2814
03:22:31,460 --> 03:22:33,120
I hated my entire team.

2815
03:22:36,980 --> 03:22:39,900
I truly did hate my entire team.

2816
03:22:40,440 --> 03:22:43,300
I had so much rage in that one game.

2817
03:22:46,460 --> 03:22:51,200
I just I just those games did not feel real

2818
03:22:55,020 --> 03:23:17,700
I feel like everything I did so much no this that the enemy team was definitely a lot worse I don't know you guys saw that the strange altered me I the mag chased me fucked up his all I lived and then the strange altered me I still lived and I built up my,

2819
03:23:17,840 --> 03:23:25,020
I built up my ult because of all that bullshit and we were able to save that round for one more fight.

2820
03:23:26,200 --> 03:23:28,780
We were able to save the point for one more fight.

2821
03:23:29,280 --> 03:23:47,020
And then, the fact that there was one strange and three of us, it was one strange and three of us, and you guys all just saw me shooting at that one strange slowly floating away until he was one.

2822
03:23:47,040 --> 03:24:19,360
one hp like that's that's when i knew that my team was very special is that's when i knew i was like i was like i can't i can't deal with this team the zero awareness from my entire team that fight watching him slowly float away too Made me so sad.

2823
03:24:19,780 --> 03:24:23,100
It was the slowest escape.

2824
03:24:23,420 --> 03:24:24,020
No!

2825
03:24:24,480 --> 03:24:26,140
Stop fighting!

2826
03:24:29,820 --> 03:24:32,380
Why can't we be friends?

2827
03:24:32,680 --> 03:24:34,800
Why can't we be friends?

2828
03:24:34,940 --> 03:24:35,260
Why?

2829
03:24:35,380 --> 03:24:36,880
Oh wait, yeah, we can't have to slow walk.

2830
03:24:38,640 --> 03:24:39,280
Hello, Jeff.

2831
03:24:42,440 --> 03:24:42,840
Yeah!

2832
03:24:43,020 --> 03:24:43,300
Oh!

2833
03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:48,840
Oh, fat touch.

2834
03:24:49,560 --> 03:24:49,720
What?

2835
03:24:50,160 --> 03:24:50,740
Why me?

2836
03:24:53,920 --> 03:24:56,440
I'm just watching me get shot at.

2837
03:24:57,440 --> 03:24:57,960
Guys.

2838
03:24:59,960 --> 03:25:00,560
Guys.

2839
03:25:02,020 --> 03:25:02,760
She crazy.

2840
03:25:06,800 --> 03:25:07,980
She crazy.

2841
03:25:09,340 --> 03:25:14,580
Get her out of here.

2842
03:25:15,260 --> 03:25:16,040
Oh, that's right.

2843
03:25:16,140 --> 03:25:16,720
Run, bitch.

2844
03:25:17,400 --> 03:25:17,840
Run.

2845
03:25:18,600 --> 03:25:19,980
That's what you get.

2846
03:25:21,320 --> 03:25:22,820
That's fucking right.

2847
03:25:23,660 --> 03:25:24,720
And now we can chill.

2848
03:25:26,260 --> 03:25:27,340
Hello, everybody.

2849
03:25:29,180 --> 03:25:29,560
Whoa!

2850
03:25:31,460 --> 03:25:31,800
That!

2851
03:25:32,080 --> 03:25:32,700
Oh, my God!

2852
03:25:36,300 --> 03:25:37,440
What the fuck?

2853
03:25:37,540 --> 03:25:39,140
He's literally just bullying me!

2854
03:25:41,680 --> 03:25:43,600
I just wanted to chill!

2855
03:25:45,260 --> 03:25:45,980
That's fucked.

2856
03:25:47,600 --> 03:25:48,900
What did I ever do to her?

2857
03:25:49,080 --> 03:25:50,340
I just wanted to chill.

2858
03:25:53,400 --> 03:25:55,360
You didn't kill the other Jeff.

2859
03:25:57,280 --> 03:25:58,520
There was the other Jeff here.

2860
03:25:58,780 --> 03:25:59,400
Kill her.

2861
03:26:00,140 --> 03:26:01,100
Kill him.

2862
03:26:02,220 --> 03:26:02,600
What about?

2863
03:26:02,620 --> 03:26:02,960
Yeah.

2864
03:26:03,200 --> 03:26:04,160
Kill him.

2865
03:26:05,160 --> 03:26:05,420
Yeah.

2866
03:26:07,320 --> 03:26:09,120
As long as it's not...

2867
03:26:09,120 --> 03:26:09,840
Don't worry, Jeff.

2868
03:26:10,120 --> 03:26:10,740
I'll help you.

2869
03:26:11,900 --> 03:26:12,840
I'll help you.

2870
03:26:13,860 --> 03:26:14,340
Don't worry.

2871

2874
03:26:26,060 --> 03:26:26,440
Wait, Jeff?

2875
03:26:26,560 --> 03:26:27,720
Oh, Emma wants hugs?

That's my goal.

2906
03:28:19,730 --> 03:28:21,010
That's my goal.

2907
03:28:21,770 --> 03:28:26,550
Eventually I'll be able to play Jeff for an entire game without having to counter swap.

2908
03:28:28,050 --> 03:28:29,170
Because I'm throwing.

2909
03:28:39,000 --> 03:28:39,540
I'm gone.

2910
03:28:39,740 --> 03:28:40,700
Thank you for the tier one song.

2911
03:28:40,780 --> 03:28:41,640
Thank you.

2912
03:28:41,720 --> 03:28:43,060
I really appreciate it.

2913
03:28:43,500 --> 03:28:44,480
Oh, they forgot to do a ban.

2914
03:28:46,040 --> 03:28:46,440
Magneto.

2915
03:28:46,720 --> 03:28:47,840
We don't...

2916
03:28:48,640 --> 03:28:48,940
Emma.

2917
03:28:49,040 --> 03:28:49,920
I read a ban, Emma.

2918
03:28:50,540 --> 03:28:51,920
Yeah, I was gonna say, mag.

2919
03:28:58,210 --> 03:28:59,390
We got this.

2920
03:29:05,190 --> 03:29:05,390
Alright.

2921
03:29:06,690 --> 03:29:06,770
Oh.

2922
03:29:07,570 --> 03:29:07,770
Eh.

2923
03:29:08,530 --> 03:29:10,390
Not that any of the world would that ban.

2924
03:29:13,090 --> 03:29:13,490
Alright.

2925
03:29:14,390 --> 03:29:15,790
Jeff time, Jeff time.

2926
03:29:18,910 --> 03:29:21,870
Oh, yeah, that gives Venom...

2927
03:29:21,870 --> 03:29:23,270
Don't I have a team up with Venom?

2928
03:29:23,930 --> 03:29:24,290
That's Jeff?

2929
03:29:25,070 --> 03:29:25,890
What's my team up?

2930
03:29:26,430 --> 03:29:27,110
I don't remember.

2931
03:29:28,430 --> 03:29:35,600
Venom shares Jeff's links with nearby allies, releasing a large healing burst that converts...

2932
03:29:36,050 --> 03:29:36,590
Wait, what?

2933
03:29:38,850 --> 03:29:40,210
Oh, okay, I can...

2934
03:29:40,210 --> 03:29:41,150
Oh, the mini Syllabon!

2935
03:29:41,390 --> 03:29:41,670
Yeah.

2936
03:29:44,370 --> 03:29:45,750
I never tried it before.

2937
03:29:47,330 --> 03:29:48,490
What does it look like?

2938
03:29:51,270 --> 03:29:52,770
So that heals, right?

2939
03:29:53,630 --> 03:29:53,950
Oh!

2940
03:29:56,130 --> 03:29:56,650
Okay.

2941
03:29:57,710 --> 03:29:58,130
Alright.

2942
03:29:58,690 --> 03:29:59,730
It's just a soulbot.

2943
03:29:59,990 --> 03:30:00,430
That's fine.

2944
03:30:03,730 --> 03:30:04,490
It's like a rubber...

2945
03:30:04,490 --> 03:30:04,930
I like it.

2946
03:30:04,970 --> 03:30:06,570
I like the sound effect for it.

2947
03:30:06,630 --> 03:30:07,490
It's like a rubber ducky.

2948
03:30:08,650 --> 03:30:09,170
Yeah.

2949
03:30:10,890 --> 03:30:15,330
I won't be diving.

2950
03:30:15,570 --> 03:30:16,350
I'll be healing with...

2951
03:30:16,370 --> 03:30:17,090
with my Luna.

2952
03:30:18,990 --> 03:30:23,270
Like, I haven't had a single triple support game, like, on my team.

2953
03:30:23,790 --> 03:30:29,490
I'm playing against every triple support, but somehow my team is just allergic to it.

2954
03:30:29,510 --> 03:30:29,850
Yeah!

2955
03:30:32,550 --> 03:30:33,390
Water, water.

2956
03:30:33,730 --> 03:30:35,190
And I water the way.

2957
03:30:35,390 --> 03:30:36,130
Water, water.

2958
03:30:36,910 --> 03:30:38,590
And I water the way.

2959
03:30:39,010 --> 03:30:39,550
Water, water.

2960
03:30:41,830 --> 03:30:42,050
Oh.

2961
03:30:43,050 --> 03:30:44,950
I'm just slowly watering.

2962
03:30:46,370 --> 03:30:48,070
And I'm still waddling.

2963
03:30:48,770 --> 03:30:49,230
Oh my god.

2964
03:30:49,670 --> 03:30:50,270
Oh my god.

2965
03:30:50,610 --> 03:30:51,230
Oh my god.

2966
03:30:51,410 --> 03:30:52,670
Don't let him kill me.

2967
03:30:53,870 --> 03:30:56,710
Please, I don't want to use my thing yet.

2968
03:30:59,810 --> 03:31:00,470
Alright, nice.

2969
03:31:02,790 --> 03:31:05,250
I was going to say, what the fuck?

2970
03:31:05,390 --> 03:31:06,070
How am I already?

2971
03:31:07,910 --> 03:31:08,230
Oh.

2972
03:31:08,970 --> 03:31:09,730
This guy.

2973
03:31:10,530 --> 03:31:11,990
I can't believe I live there.

2974
03:31:12,910 --> 03:31:13,850
Well, not him, though.

2975
03:31:14,030 --> 03:31:14,790
What the fuck?

2976
03:31:20,250 --> 03:31:21,130
What the...

2977
03:31:21,130 --> 03:31:21,610
He's one.

2978
03:31:21,830 --> 03:31:22,730
He's actually one.

2979
03:31:23,590 --> 03:31:24,090
He's one.

2980
03:31:24,890 --> 03:31:25,330
There you go.

2981
03:31:25,530 --> 03:31:26,430
I have to use that.

2982
03:31:26,910 --> 03:31:28,590
I got scared.

2983
03:31:30,190 --> 03:31:32,810
Please, Luna, we had to support each other!

2984
03:31:33,430 --> 03:31:34,650
They only have one healer right now.

2985
03:31:34,770 --> 03:31:35,250
Kill fringe.

2986
03:31:35,350 --> 03:31:38,110
Yeah, we also have one... Oh my god, I need triple support.

2987
03:31:38,350 --> 03:31:39,230
They're triple support.

2988
03:31:39,710 --> 03:31:40,150
They're...

2989
03:31:40,150 --> 03:31:42,110
I fucking knew it.

2990
03:31:45,230 --> 03:31:46,570
I fucking knew it.

2991
03:31:46,630 --> 03:31:46,850
I fucking knew it.

2992
03:31:49,490 --> 03:31:50,930
Just as I said.

2993
03:31:52,230 --> 03:31:54,030
No triple support for me.

2994
03:31:54,630 --> 03:31:55,110
Excuse me.

2995
03:31:56,170 --> 03:31:56,490
Hello.

2996
03:31:56,610 --> 03:31:58,530
I would also like to be up top.

2997
03:31:59,170 --> 03:31:59,850
Thank you.

2998
03:32:09,900 --> 03:32:11,300
I'm doing my job.

2999
03:32:12,000 --> 03:32:12,480
Oh my god.

3000
03:32:12,620 --> 03:32:13,620
I'm still doing my job.

3001
03:32:15,520 --> 03:32:18,620
Okay, before I start, I'll have to...

3002
03:32:19,360 --> 03:32:19,660
Okay.

3003
03:32:19,680 --> 03:32:21,480
Okay, did he fuck it up?

3004
03:32:21,680 --> 03:32:22,740
Well, let's find out.

3005
03:32:22,980 --> 03:32:24,040
Yep, he did.

3006
03:32:26,220 --> 03:32:27,580
I have to use this.

3007
03:32:27,780 --> 03:32:28,980
I got scared.

3008
03:32:33,510 --> 03:32:35,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3009
03:32:35,390 --> 03:32:36,170
Whoa, whoa.

3010
03:32:38,090 --> 03:32:38,910
I had to...

3011
03:32:38,910 --> 03:32:39,630
I'm so scared.

3012
03:32:39,710 --> 03:32:40,070
No!

3013
03:32:40,610 --> 03:32:42,190
I couldn't do anything.

3014
03:32:42,750 --> 03:32:43,570
The mag!

3015
03:32:44,010 --> 03:32:45,970
The mag followed me!

3016
03:32:46,690 --> 03:32:50,770
I'm so sad.

3017
03:32:51,910 --> 03:32:55,110
And I waddle the way, waddle, waddle.

3018
03:32:56,750 --> 03:32:56,890
No.

3019
03:32:57,390 --> 03:32:59,330
No shark time.

3020
03:33:02,630 --> 03:33:04,590
Please get over here.

3021
03:33:04,750 --> 03:33:05,370
Close cut, close cut.

3022
03:33:07,030 --> 03:33:07,510
Get over.

3023
03:33:07,630 --> 03:33:09,210
Please, please stop moving.

3024
03:33:10,570 --> 03:33:12,030
Try my best to kill you.

3025
03:33:12,770 --> 03:33:13,890
Stop moving.

3026
03:33:19,100 --> 03:33:21,420
They used everything to kill me.

3027
03:33:22,520 --> 03:33:23,360
It was sad.

3028
03:33:23,940 --> 03:33:25,760
I was so sad.

3029
03:33:27,460 --> 03:33:28,220
Team devio, team dev.

3030
03:33:28,920 --> 03:33:29,260
That's right.

3031
03:33:29,460 --> 03:33:31,840
Even when you can't see me, I'll still make you ready.

3032
03:33:31,840 --> 03:33:32,540
I got scared.

3033
03:33:32,760 --> 03:33:34,240
I, guys, you don't understand.

3034
03:33:34,360 --> 03:33:35,240
I got scared.

3035
03:33:35,380 --> 03:33:38,000
The mag was coming after me, guys.

3036
03:33:38,380 --> 03:33:40,940
I was like, I had to spit him out.

3037
03:33:44,360 --> 03:33:47,020
They keep trying to get me.

3038
03:33:50,440 --> 03:33:51,780
Alright, don't worry.

3039
03:33:52,420 --> 03:33:52,680
Don't worry.

3040
03:33:52,780 --> 03:33:53,340
I believe.

3041
03:33:53,760 --> 03:33:54,980
I believe.

3042
03:33:56,480 --> 03:33:57,780
God, I need a little motivation.

3043
03:33:58,740 --> 03:34:00,580
I'll get some motivation real quick.

3044
03:34:00,840 --> 03:34:01,240
That's right.

3045
03:34:02,180 --> 03:34:02,960
Yum, yum.

3046
03:34:03,820 --> 03:34:04,880
Yum, yum.

3047
03:34:06,360 --> 03:34:08,120
I'm all about the quality, too.

3048
03:34:11,920 --> 03:34:12,520
No.

3049
03:34:13,480 --> 03:34:15,640
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

3050
03:34:15,940 --> 03:34:18,120
I'll chomp all the asses.

3051
03:34:22,650 --> 03:34:23,370
All right.

3052
03:34:26,570 --> 03:34:29,130
A lot of triple support.

3053
03:34:29,870 --> 03:34:33,630
All right.

3054
03:34:33,650 --> 03:34:34,490
One and then two.

3055
03:34:35,010 --> 03:34:35,890
One on Invis.

3056
03:34:36,550 --> 03:34:36,970
Jesus.

3057
03:34:38,390 --> 03:34:39,230
Invis cut.

3058
03:34:40,230 --> 03:34:41,030
No more.

3059
03:34:41,150 --> 03:34:41,970
I'm shooting it.

3060
03:34:42,170 --> 03:34:42,870
I'm okay.

3061
03:34:43,030 --> 03:34:43,670
I shot it.

3062
03:34:43,810 --> 03:34:44,330
I shot it.

3063
03:34:44,450 --> 03:34:44,950
I shot it.

3064
03:34:45,750 --> 03:34:46,510
Oh, it's on half.

3065
03:34:49,030 --> 03:34:49,450
Symbiotic.

3066
03:34:49,630 --> 03:34:49,910
Oh, turn one.

3067
03:34:50,010 --> 03:34:50,330
Oh, turn one.

3068
03:34:50,890 --> 03:34:51,310
Nice.

3069
03:34:51,710 --> 03:34:51,750
Nice.

3070
03:34:51,790 --> 03:34:52,170
Look at that.

3071
03:34:52,830 --> 03:34:53,810
I did it, guys.

3072
03:34:54,130 --> 03:34:56,470
Guys, I'm going to win an entire round on Jeff, guys.

3073
03:34:56,570 --> 03:34:57,820
I'm doing it.

3074
03:35:00,190 --> 03:35:01,050
Oh, yay.

3075
03:35:01,170 --> 03:35:02,030
I did it!

3076
03:35:02,090 --> 03:35:02,590
Yay!

3077
03:35:04,970 --> 03:35:06,430
I did it!

3078
03:35:07,230 --> 03:35:08,810
We did it!

3079
03:35:09,350 --> 03:35:14,130
It only took three hours.

3080
03:35:14,430 --> 03:35:16,850
And we won an entire game on Jeff.

3081
03:35:20,450 --> 03:35:24,270
We, look, look, we didn't see the swap, guys.

3082
03:35:24,410 --> 03:35:25,570
We didn't see the swap.

3083
03:35:25,650 --> 03:35:26,550
I technically won.

3084
03:35:26,570 --> 03:35:28,590
an entire game on Jeff.

3085
03:35:28,790 --> 03:35:29,770
There was no swaps.

3086
03:35:31,210 --> 03:35:31,650
Yay!

3087
03:35:33,990 --> 03:35:34,570
Alright.

3088
03:35:35,110 --> 03:35:36,070
Let's keep playing.

3089
03:35:36,990 --> 03:35:37,930
Oops, I actually went up.

3090
03:35:38,070 --> 03:35:38,670
Alright, no, I'm gonna...

3091
03:35:38,670 --> 03:35:40,390

3094
03:36:47,480 --> 03:36:48,060
Back.

3095
03:36:49,100 --> 03:36:50,580
Came back to peak.

3096
03:36:51,320 --> 03:36:52,400
Peak venom.

3097
03:36:53,420 --> 03:36:57,080
The best thing Marvel Ravos has ever done for this game.

3098
03:36:59,920 --> 03:37:01,960
that's what you came back to

3099
03:37:18,520 --> 03:37:30,780

3100
03:37:31,900 --> 03:37:34,840
I'm so disappointed in society.

3101
03:37:36,020 --> 03:37:37,080
But that's okay.

3102
03:37:37,500 --> 03:37:39,160
I will be the change.

3103
03:37:41,960 --> 03:37:45,160
I'll be the change that the world deserves.

3104
03:37:46,640 --> 03:37:48,560
Have no fear, roleplayers.

3105
03:37:49,720 --> 03:37:50,980
Venom is here.

3106
03:37:52,180 --> 03:37:53,540
Have no fear.

3107
03:37:56,640 --> 03:37:58,520

3111
03:38:36,180 --> 03:38:39,020
I want it to be centered.

3112
03:38:43,880 --> 03:38:44,840
You can't believe it.

3113
03:38:44,840 --> 03:38:45,860
Who was that BP?

3114
03:38:46,440 --> 03:38:47,820
I will report him.

3115
03:38:48,200 --> 03:38:48,760
Devs.

3116
03:38:49,200 --> 03:38:51,080
I think he was acting.

3117
03:38:57,500 --> 03:38:58,080
Why?

3118
03:38:58,180 --> 03:38:59,780
Because they don't understand fun.

3119
03:38:59,960 --> 03:39:01,480
They play back Black Panther.

3120
03:39:02,300 --> 03:39:03,700
They don't know what it's like.

3121
03:39:11,980 --> 03:39:12,560
Guan Quan.

3122
03:39:13,240 --> 03:39:14,220
Send in the nuke.

3123
03:39:18,730 --> 03:39:22,890
They are sad little boys living their sad little life.

3124
03:39:26,950 --> 03:39:29,050
Is my team not doing bans?

3125
03:39:29,750 --> 03:39:31,730
Then I'm banning Emma and grabbing water.

3126
03:39:31,950 --> 03:39:33,630
My water's next to me.

3127
03:39:50,080 --> 03:39:52,480
Grab my water.

3128
03:39:52,840 --> 03:39:53,580
Grab my water.

3129
03:39:58,910 --> 03:40:00,850
Where am I feeling?

3130
03:40:06,210 --> 03:40:37,450
I really want to play I'll play cloak I really want to play all try but ultra only works with triple support but let me go cloak please bye we didn't ask to be heroes but we always answer baby what a little baby all right I let you pick I gave you time

3131
03:40:41,580 --> 03:40:46,900
plant remains have never experienced happiness true so true

3132
03:40:51,710 --> 03:41:08,210
I have not had a single triple support team so I can't I want to play at a more ultra but I haven't had a single team that that I swear I played for four hours and not a single one of my team wants to play triple support.

3133
03:41:08,390 --> 03:41:11,230
We've beaten triple support teams only because our...

3134
03:41:11,230 --> 03:41:15,210
Oh my god, that Phoenix got so much I'll charge off of this.

3135
03:41:16,610 --> 03:41:19,630
Only because someone decided to be marked.

3136
03:41:22,930 --> 03:41:23,910
I'll use that.

3137
03:41:26,310 --> 03:41:28,330
I'll charge my shield again, too.

3138
03:41:32,720 --> 03:41:33,100
Hit.

3139
03:41:35,220 --> 03:41:37,320
Guys, I think I know whose Hawkeye is better.

3140
03:41:38,460 --> 03:41:39,640
Oh, no, I'm so scared.

3141
03:41:39,900 --> 03:41:41,000
Hawkeye scares me.

3142
03:41:41,460 --> 03:41:43,900
Only because, um...

3143
03:41:45,280 --> 03:41:48,300
Only because, like, it's just, you know, one shot.

3144
03:41:48,380 --> 03:41:49,360
That one shot attack.

3145
03:41:50,140 --> 03:41:50,720
Yeah, I got it.

3146
03:41:52,340 --> 03:41:54,300
I'm just scared of getting one shot randomly.

3147
03:41:54,700 --> 03:41:56,320
Like, it can happen to anyone.

3148
03:41:58,780 --> 03:42:00,380
Oh, my God, that's so unlucky.

3149
03:42:02,640 --> 03:42:04,040
Oh, I hope you live.

3150
03:42:09,500 --> 03:42:11,140
First, that was a good cloak.

3151
03:42:13,440 --> 03:42:14,040
Come on.

3152
03:42:15,860 --> 03:42:16,600
Come on.

3153
03:42:16,980 --> 03:42:21,800
Come on, cloak.

3154
03:42:22,420 --> 03:42:22,820
Come on.

3155
03:42:22,900 --> 03:42:23,540
There we go.

3156
03:42:23,760 --> 03:42:24,540
There, that's what I...

3157
03:42:24,540 --> 03:42:25,200
Don't get off.

3158
03:42:25,460 --> 03:42:26,400
Don't, don't, don't get...

3159
03:42:26,400 --> 03:42:26,540
Okay.

3160
03:42:26,860 --> 03:42:27,700
I'm doing my...

3161
03:42:27,700 --> 03:42:28,380
Holy...

3162
03:42:28,380 --> 03:42:29,660
I don't know if you guys noticed that.

3163
03:42:30,160 --> 03:42:31,220
But I did my...

3164
03:42:31,220 --> 03:42:32,060
I literally...

3165
03:42:32,060 --> 03:42:33,020
I saved our cloak.

3166
03:42:33,820 --> 03:42:34,300
I...

3167
03:42:34,900 --> 03:43:08,420

3169
03:43:12,320 --> 03:43:14,160
Oh shit, okay.

3170
03:43:15,740 --> 03:43:16,660
I tried.

3171
03:43:19,680 --> 03:43:21,000
Oh no.

3172
03:43:22,080 --> 03:43:23,500
I had nothing for that.

3173
03:43:29,040 --> 03:43:31,960
Yeah, she was like cloaking.

3174
03:43:32,400 --> 03:43:33,580
She cloaked all did.

3175
03:43:35,420 --> 03:43:37,180
Straight into...

3176
03:43:37,180 --> 03:43:37,980
Straight into a...

3177
03:43:38,000 --> 03:43:57,560
Hawkeye that was crazy to see I was just like are you okay the fact that I was able to save his life I'm just happy okay I have all of them

3178
03:44:02,460 --> 03:44:13,080
okay I pulled him closer nice that was a good I didn't trust my cloak I It's just like I'm in this E-Lo that I trust less.

3179
03:44:13,300 --> 03:44:15,880
I have stress issues in this E-Lo.

3180
03:44:18,760 --> 03:44:19,500
I need to trust my...

3181
03:44:19,500 --> 03:44:22,400
I'm just trying to trust my cloak to...

3182
03:44:24,600 --> 03:44:26,220
To save my life.

3183
03:44:30,060 --> 03:44:30,500
Hey, guys.

3184
03:44:30,600 --> 03:44:31,040
There's an...

3185
03:44:31,040 --> 03:44:31,300
What?

3186
03:44:31,400 --> 03:44:31,680
Okay.

3187
03:44:32,220 --> 03:44:33,380
Okay, I actually still died.

3188
03:44:34,740 --> 03:44:35,200
Oh, my...

3189
03:44:35,200 --> 03:44:35,880
Okay, I was gonna...

3190
03:44:35,880 --> 03:44:37,600
I was so worried that she was gonna do that again.

3191
03:44:40,260 --> 03:44:40,700
This?

3192
03:44:40,700 --> 03:44:40,960
This?

3193
03:44:41,140 --> 03:44:41,580
This?

3194
03:44:41,960 --> 03:44:42,140
This?

3195
03:44:44,940 --> 03:44:46,120
Like, it's just hard.

3196
03:44:46,660 --> 03:44:48,460
I have trust issues in this Elo.

3197
03:44:55,140 --> 03:44:55,920
That's five.

3198
03:44:57,500 --> 03:44:58,400
I still have ult.

3199
03:44:59,340 --> 03:45:01,020
And I'm still healing my guy.

3200
03:45:01,440 --> 03:45:02,100
He has ult.

3201
03:45:02,260 --> 03:45:03,100
That strange has ult.

3202
03:45:04,020 --> 03:45:06,500
I just gotta make sure I get it.

3203
03:45:07,260 --> 03:45:07,640
Nice.

3204
03:45:09,040 --> 03:45:10,900
I need to make sure he doesn't.

3205
03:45:12,140 --> 03:45:14,880
My god, he so wants to jump right now.

3206
03:45:19,520 --> 03:45:20,380
It's fine.

3207
03:45:21,600 --> 03:45:22,120
We're okay.

3208
03:45:22,860 --> 03:45:23,940
We're like right here.

3209
03:45:24,840 --> 03:45:25,340
It's fine.

3210
03:45:25,960 --> 03:45:26,660
I live.

3211
03:45:30,460 --> 03:45:31,140
Nice.

3212
03:45:32,040 --> 03:45:35,320
Oh, nice.

3213
03:45:36,200 --> 03:45:37,000
Not nice.

3214
03:45:37,140 --> 03:45:37,880
Not nice, actually.

3215
03:45:38,420 --> 03:45:39,000
Not nice.

3216
03:45:40,080 --> 03:45:41,100
We don't have DPS.

3217
03:45:46,630 --> 03:45:47,410
That's not nice.

3218
03:45:49,710 --> 03:45:50,230
Okay.

3219
03:45:51,250 --> 03:45:51,970
It's okay.

3220
03:45:52,230 --> 03:45:53,030
Everything is fine.

3221
03:45:53,410 --> 03:45:53,890
Everything is...

3222
03:45:53,890 --> 03:45:54,690
Oh, they have Groot.

3223
03:45:55,250 --> 03:45:55,970
They have Groot.

3224
03:45:56,350 --> 03:45:57,770
Oh, everything is not fine.

3225
03:45:57,890 --> 03:45:58,390
I'm...

3226
03:45:58,390 --> 03:46:00,110
I don't have shields anymore, but that's okay.

3227
03:46:01,010 --> 03:46:02,490
Oh, babe, mag, mag.

3228
03:46:02,790 --> 03:46:03,350
Don't die.

3229
03:46:04,950 --> 03:46:05,690
Oh, okay.

3230
03:46:05,810 --> 03:46:06,130
He's fine.

3231
03:46:06,370 --> 03:46:07,030
Just fuck off.

3232
03:46:07,110 --> 03:46:07,790
Don't fall back.

3233
03:46:10,090 --> 03:46:10,930
That's right.

3234
03:46:11,510 --> 03:46:12,870
We're getting healed.

3235
03:46:13,810 --> 03:46:14,850
Trust us.

3236
03:46:15,890 --> 03:46:16,270
Okay.

3237
03:46:17,610 --> 03:46:19,210

No, he did not.

3246
03:47:43,840 --> 03:47:45,640
The cloak has no feet.

3247
03:47:47,260 --> 03:47:48,520
Meg probably has a hold though.

3248
03:47:49,540 --> 03:47:50,140
Holy shit.

3249
03:47:51,180 --> 03:47:53,180
I'm gonna get in there now.

3250
03:47:55,440 --> 03:48:01,840
Not as soon as I walk in with me on the first three by the time I start doing the second level now.

3251
03:48:02,640 --> 03:48:04,540
Oh my god, they went squirrel girl.

3252
03:48:04,720 --> 03:48:05,780
What will they do?

3253
03:48:06,680 --> 03:48:08,340
I have to do.

3254
03:48:08,580 --> 03:48:23,400
Oh Oh, let's hope he gets shield Let's hope um I don't think he got shield guys I I don't think he got shield.

3255
03:48:23,680 --> 03:48:24,770
I don't think he got shield

3256
03:48:29,280 --> 03:48:31,760

I was like what happened to the shield?

3260
03:48:41,460 --> 03:48:49,420
I think the fact that they're strange just casually just walked up to us with no consequence like

the best not gonna lie that didn't feel very good oh that sucks oh my god I literally just got it I just got healed that sucks okay

3263
03:49:30,800 --> 03:49:32,760
Oh, we don't have time.

3264
03:49:33,000 --> 03:49:33,360
No.

3265
03:49:36,160 --> 03:49:36,640
No!

3266
03:49:37,500 --> 03:49:37,760
No!

3267
03:49:38,340 --> 03:49:42,520
The current score is zero, two, three.

3268
03:49:43,300 --> 03:49:45,880
This train literally just walked up to us.

3269
03:49:46,120 --> 03:49:47,280
Which side you're on?

3270
03:49:47,560 --> 03:49:48,940
And nobody cared.

3271
03:49:53,670 --> 03:49:54,630
No, we needed.

3272
03:49:55,210 --> 03:49:57,410
We just needed our team to turn around.

3273
03:49:57,970 --> 03:50:04,390
The fact that The Strange can just casually walking up to us with no consequences.

3274
03:50:04,770 --> 03:50:06,590
And then my support and I couldn't do anything.

3275
03:50:07,870 --> 03:50:09,910
Because, like, The Strange was already fully charged.

3276
03:50:11,010 --> 03:50:12,250
I guess I'll go Luna.

3277
03:50:14,470 --> 03:50:17,090
I guess I'll go Luna.

3278
03:50:32,580 --> 03:50:35,100
If our team turn around.

3279
03:50:35,120 --> 03:51:27,680

3280
03:51:34,040 --> 03:51:35,580
Hey, hey cloak.

3281
03:51:37,020 --> 03:51:39,920
Did you see my cloak literally walking past me?

3282
03:51:39,980 --> 03:51:40,840
I'm like, that's cool.

3283
03:51:44,080 --> 03:51:44,540
Bro.

3284
03:51:48,680 --> 03:51:53,160
There's like, guys, there is a Hawkeye right in front of us, please.

3285
03:51:54,760 --> 03:51:54,920

That is sad.

3290
03:54:03,870 --> 03:54:05,070
That is...

3291
03:54:05,070 --> 03:54:05,930
That is...

3292
03:54:05,930 --> 03:54:06,210
That is sad.

3293
03:54:06,730 --> 03:54:08,990
I don't think he should have gone cab.

3294
03:54:10,290 --> 03:54:11,490
He's dead.

3295
03:54:12,790 --> 03:54:13,390
Dead.

3296
03:54:14,150 --> 03:54:14,810
That's fine.

3297
03:54:17,090 --> 03:54:17,850
There we go.

3298
03:54:18,350 --> 03:54:19,390
We gotta kill.

3299
03:54:22,530 --> 03:54:24,010
Oh my god, I'm in them.

3300
03:54:24,910 --> 03:54:25,890
I messed up there.

3301
03:54:31,400 --> 03:54:32,600
Oh my god.

3302
03:54:32,620 --> 03:54:32,960
All right.

3303
03:54:35,300 --> 03:54:38,700
All right, we used five ults there.

3304
03:54:40,160 --> 03:54:43,980
See guys, we just had the, oh, that's crazy.

3305
03:54:45,820 --> 03:54:48,340
We went because we alted.

3306
03:54:49,100 --> 03:54:50,920
What a crazy concept.

3307
03:54:53,420 --> 03:54:56,420
What a fucking insane concept.

3308
03:54:56,940 --> 03:54:58,460
By alting you win.

3309
03:54:59,080 --> 03:55:01,520
Help get that vehicle to its destination.

3310
03:55:02,620 --> 03:55:04,200
Okay, I should give this to the captain.

3311
03:55:06,120 --> 03:55:08,780
Okay, that was not salvageable.

3312
03:55:10,780 --> 03:55:11,820
That was...

3313
03:55:11,820 --> 03:55:12,580
That was...

3314
03:55:12,580 --> 03:55:13,500
That was...

3315
03:55:13,500 --> 03:55:14,680
Okay, that...

3316
03:55:14,680 --> 03:55:15,780
That was interesting.

3317
03:55:16,080 --> 03:55:17,320
This is gonna be a problem.

3318
03:55:18,300 --> 03:55:19,460
We have a mag.

3319
03:55:19,620 --> 03:55:20,460
What do you mean?

3320
03:55:24,020 --> 03:55:25,480
Oh my god.

3321
03:55:27,640 --> 03:55:28,680
He got bubbled.

3322
03:55:28,880 --> 03:55:30,680
He actually... They actually started bubbling him.

3323
03:55:30,860 --> 03:55:32,440
They actually started bubbling him.

3324
03:55:32,620 --> 03:55:34,120
I'm not really that scary.

3325
03:55:38,000 --> 03:55:41,120
The fact that they started bubbling him is crazy.

3326
03:55:48,000 --> 03:55:48,760
Oh my god.

3327
03:55:49,040 --> 03:55:49,820
He's freaks.

3328
03:55:51,160 --> 03:55:53,220
But also, yeah, I have to...

3329
03:55:53,220 --> 03:55:54,340
Hey, we don't have a bubble.

3330
03:55:54,500 --> 03:55:54,760
Good luck.

3331
03:55:54,880 --> 03:55:55,780
Oh, thank god he missed.

3332
03:55:56,380 --> 03:55:57,440
He doesn't play basketball.

3333
03:56:01,060 --> 03:56:02,660
Please stand on the...

3334
03:56:02,660 --> 03:56:04,420
And also, please don't get headshot.

3335
03:56:05,260 --> 03:56:06,660
That'll be pretty sweet.

3336
03:56:08,960 --> 03:56:10,140
Just don't get headshot.

3337
03:56:10,340 --> 03:56:11,000
Just don't get headshot.

3338
03:56:11,160 --> 03:56:11,960
Just don't get headshot.

3339
03:56:12,800 --> 03:56:20,110
Is that just don't get just Oh my god, fuck it.

3340
03:56:20,150 --> 03:56:21,150
They forced it.

3341
03:56:24,030 --> 03:56:26,490
Just don't get headshot just oh

3342
03:56:32,070 --> 03:56:42,010
Hello We live this we do he has zero charge, but I don't know we leave live this though Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it, it's right there.

3343
03:56:46,620 --> 03:56:48,320
You know what would be so cool if you shot?

3344
03:56:48,440 --> 03:56:49,560
Okay, you shot it.

3345
03:56:53,300 --> 03:56:56,800
I think this is actually a team diff right here.

3346
03:56:59,340 --> 03:57:01,680
It's literally a team comp diff too.

3347
03:57:03,160 --> 03:57:04,960
Is my Captain America still alive?

3348
03:57:05,780 --> 03:57:06,300
Like...

3349
03:57:06,300 --> 03:57:07,400
Where is he?

3350
03:57:07,680 --> 03:57:08,880
Oh, he died.

3351
03:57:10,460 --> 03:57:11,900
I didn't even realize.

3352
03:57:14,480 --> 03:57:16,360
Oh, I might have missed.

3353
03:57:17,700 --> 03:57:19,840
I may or may not have missed my shot.

3354
03:57:23,670 --> 03:57:24,190
That's okay.

3355
03:57:26,170 --> 03:57:29,170
Sometimes the EOMM just hits different.

3356
03:57:31,650 --> 03:57:34,710
It's just it's just E-M-O-L, E-O-M-M.

3357
03:57:36,730 --> 03:57:39,210
Sometimes it just hits different.

3358
03:57:45,050 --> 03:57:46,250
I

3359
03:57:50,870 --> 03:57:53,410
It is what it is

3360
03:57:59,640 --> 03:58:02,320
Hey, together

3361
03:58:10,290 --> 03:58:20,830
It's just very unlucky It's just simply We are playing with No shields.

3362
03:58:22,050 --> 03:58:24,210
Which is very difficult.

3363
03:58:27,510 --> 03:58:28,570
Oh, I should have picked Loki.

3364
03:58:29,170 --> 03:58:33,030
It's pretty difficult when you have zero shields against this cop.

3365
03:58:33,510 --> 03:58:42,390
You know, against the Hawkeye and the Skrull Girl and Strange and Mag.

3366
03:58:42,890 --> 03:58:47,130
It's sort of pretty awkward to have zero shields against that.

3367
03:58:54,000 --> 03:58:55,240
It is what it is.

3368
03:58:56,220 --> 03:58:57,740
It was literally a zero shield game.

3369
03:59:00,680 --> 03:59:01,420
Um, excuse me.

3370
03:59:01,480 --> 03:59:03,140
Captain America technically has a shield.

3371
03:59:03,300 --> 03:59:06,060
Yeah, this fucking tiny P-shooter of a shield.

3372
03:59:08,220 --> 03:59:09,700
Like, what is he gonna block?

3373
03:59:12,900 --> 03:59:14,020
Like, that shield?

3374
03:59:14,420 --> 03:59:16,720
That shield blocks like...

3375
03:59:16,720 --> 03:59:17,200
Like...

3376
03:59:17,200 --> 03:59:18,800
Blocks like 1%.

3377
03:59:27,160 --> 03:59:29,200
I think it was just literally a team diff.

3378
03:59:29,340 --> 03:59:31,160
The comp was just impossible to...

3379
03:59:31,180 --> 03:59:46,620
play with and against unless he magically fucking reflects the rock but even then i doubt it it's okay i don't know what can motivate me i will be the change that the world deserves

3380
03:59:49,760 --> 04:00:04,920
am i gonna do a vtuber rivals no because they contacted me like super last minute um and it's on the same day as ignite so literally everyone i know um is busy and And also, like, the non, and everyone, all my other teammates are busy, too.

3381
04:00:05,860 --> 04:00:06,680
It's just two last minute.

3382
04:00:06,840 --> 04:00:08,880
I think I got contacted last week about it.

3383
04:00:11,600 --> 04:00:15,240
The pro tournament is on at the same day.

3384
04:00:16,860 --> 04:00:19,380
We asked if we could, like, change the time.

3385
04:00:20,120 --> 04:00:30,640
Like, if we could, like, at least have, because, like, Ignite matches start at 6, because, like, the VTuber Rivals thing is literally, like, I asked everyone.

3386
04:00:30,900 --> 04:00:35,280
I asked everyone I knew and everybody was busy because it was so last minute

3387
04:00:38,370 --> 04:00:48,210
um and like the ignite matches they stop they start at 6 p.m EST but the VTuber rivals end at 7 p.m.

3388
04:00:48,230 --> 04:01:08,690
EST and it's all on one day like if it was split into two days it'd be fine but like it's all on one day so literally um literally I asked everyone I knew everyone I knew that was at Super Gomez's level to replace his slot, and everyone was busy.

3389
04:01:09,590 --> 04:01:12,490
Even the ones that aren't in Ignite, because they said it was just so last minute.

3390
04:01:16,760 --> 04:01:20,420
I spent like two to three days just asking everyone I know.

3391
04:01:21,360 --> 04:01:24,760
And even then, Bedos in Japan, so he couldn't do it.

3392
04:01:25,520 --> 04:02:49,520
And I know like two other people were busy on that day, because like I said, like, by the time like, everyone already had plans on that day and it's like they have to commit because it's not split to two days it's all on one day um two three four five six it's six hours it's like a six hour commitment too so i tried to get a team but i tried to get a team but i legitimately couldn't find anyone to say yes that would say yes to it so i had to back up like i if if i could fill go mess a spot then it's fine but i find anyone to fill his spot because like I have more to lose losing that tournament than I do to winning it so if like if I'm participating I'd rather just like um he's he's one above all DPS because no I even asked sure for it and he was like that's two last minute man he was like it's two last minute I can't do it um I was in saying uh i lost my train of thought so that that's why i couldn't do the thing because when they contacted me i just it was just too late i lost my

3393
04:02:49,520 --> 04:02:51,440
train of thought though what was i saying

3394
04:02:56,700 --> 04:03:25,460
oh yeah i said oh i have more to lose um if we drop out if we like uh no i have more to lose um losing if i get knocked out early in the tournament do like winning first again so like i rather i have i don't have a team that i know could put up a good fight and like that like that is comfortable which

3395
04:03:28,840 --> 04:03:47,360
sucks like which sucks because i did try i like i literally asked ever like we asked for like if the tournament could be a bit earlier um we asked the tournament could be a bit earlier we asked like oh it's possible to have it on another day but they're like everything's really like set in motion They couldn't do it a little earlier because it's already,

3396
04:03:47,880 --> 04:03:49,060
like, everything was reset.

3397
04:03:50,200 --> 04:03:53,080
So, like, at that point, like, I didn't want to push more for any stuff.

3398
04:03:53,500 --> 04:03:55,940
So at that point, there was nothing I could do.

3399
04:03:56,940 --> 04:03:57,840
Nothing more I could do.

3400
04:03:59,820 --> 04:04:00,100
Oh, wait.

3401
04:04:00,180 --> 04:04:01,260
There's the...

3402
04:04:01,260 --> 04:04:01,760
It sucks.

3403
04:04:02,280 --> 04:04:02,780
It sucks.

3404
04:04:03,020 --> 04:04:03,840
But I tried.

3405
04:04:04,260 --> 04:04:07,720
I spent, like, two to three days, like, asking people.

3406
04:04:14,920 --> 04:04:15,120
Wait.

3407
04:04:15,380 --> 04:04:15,740
I'm trying.

3408
04:04:15,840 --> 04:04:16,180
No!

3409
04:04:16,620 --> 04:04:16,840
No!

3410
04:04:18,700 --> 04:04:19,490
There you go.

3411
04:04:22,560 --> 04:04:23,300
There's life.

3412
04:04:23,520 --> 04:04:24,560
There's always next time.

3413
04:04:25,580 --> 04:04:26,220
I'm ready to win.

3414
04:04:26,460 --> 04:04:28,340
Give someone a, you know, give another team a chat.

3415
04:04:28,420 --> 04:04:28,760
No!

3416
04:04:28,940 --> 04:04:29,640
My DJ!

3417
04:04:32,300 --> 04:04:32,800
No!

3418
04:04:34,660 --> 04:04:35,480
That's fine.

3419
04:04:36,100 --> 04:04:36,400
Hello.

3420
04:04:37,140 --> 04:04:37,840
Hello, shrimp.

3421
04:04:38,080 --> 04:04:38,900
Hey, wait.

3422
04:04:39,260 --> 04:04:40,760
Hey, why are you back away, huh?

3423
04:04:41,600 --> 04:04:42,400
That's right.

3424
04:04:42,760 --> 04:04:44,200
You know you like this.

3425
04:04:45,300 --> 04:04:45,520
Whoa!

3426
04:04:45,980 --> 04:04:46,900
That's right.

3427
04:04:48,760 --> 04:04:58,080
age now whoa naughty naughty yeah

3428
04:05:01,940 --> 04:06:26,860
and it gives another team a chance to win like i just really i asked i got all my i asked all my contacts like i like you don't understand i even asked my friends to ask their friends if they're free and even then they're like sorry we can't do it like to ask eu players if they were free because um wait no don't remove me i'm sorry i asked eu players too because like it's um it's not on the the ignite is not on the same day as because na ignite is on the 27th but eu ignite isn't so like it's a different time slot so i'm gonna ask eu players but even then like I couldn't get an answer like I couldn't um I couldn't like find a replacement no I think Kony is free Kony the only issue is that I don't have a replacement for Gomez that's the only issue that's like the biggest like the slot that I need and I need a DPS player because it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it has to be a DPS player i tried so hard i legitimately like spent hours like asking around and waiting for answers it's just

3429
04:06:26,860 --> 04:07:18,080
unfortunate timing because it doesn't matter if i find someone that's his elo and it's tank or support the impact of a dps player in his elo changes everything because the tank can only do so much a tank can only do so much because i even asked like people i even asked players from rad esport the eu rad esport and even they were like they were like yeah we can but like they were like it's better i was giving asking them their opinion for this meta and they were like oh oh um it's more ideal to get a dps than a tank or a support um because a good one above all dps can just steamroll the team.

3430
04:07:18,640 --> 04:07:25,220
Like, if the enemy team just has a one above all DPS player, they'll just steamroll the team.

3431
04:07:25,820 --> 04:07:26,580
It doesn't really matter.

3432
04:07:30,200 --> 04:07:32,640
Like, because, like, I had, trust me, was interested.

3433
04:07:33,780 --> 04:07:37,700
But, but, yeah, like, he was like, oh, I'll have to ask my word.

3434
04:07:38,020 --> 04:07:45,000
But he was like, I was told that, like, he said, yeah, like, it's better just get a DPS player.

3435
04:07:45,140 --> 04:07:46,240
I tried to stay positive.

3436
04:07:47,000 --> 04:07:48,940
And at that point, I gave up.

3437
04:07:49,840 --> 04:07:52,200
It's just like, I put too much effort.

3438
04:07:53,980 --> 04:08:00,740
I've already put too much effort trying to fucking salvage this.

3439
04:08:02,840 --> 04:08:03,660
I'll just ride.

3440
04:08:03,760 --> 04:08:04,280
I'll just play.

3441
04:08:05,420 --> 04:08:07,100
I'll just maybe next time.

3442
04:08:08,160 --> 04:08:09,920
I was like, I have other things to do.

3443
04:08:10,040 --> 04:08:13,020
I can't spend another day trying to find someone.

3444
04:08:14,600 --> 04:08:16,080
The battle starts in five.

3445
04:08:16,440 --> 04:08:20,000
Four, three, two, one.

3446
04:08:20,240 --> 04:08:20,500
Yeah.

3447
04:08:21,200 --> 04:08:22,040
Are you back on this map?

3448
04:08:22,180 --> 04:08:22,960
Fuck this map.

3449
04:08:31,600 --> 04:08:32,260
All right.

3450
04:08:33,860 --> 04:08:35,260
Let's get over here.

3451
04:08:35,500 --> 04:08:38,820
I hear lots of...

3452
04:08:38,820 --> 04:08:39,700
Oh, yep, I knew.

3453
04:08:39,800 --> 04:08:40,860
I was like, I hear an Angela.

3454
04:08:41,520 --> 04:08:42,220
Okay, maybe...

3455
04:08:42,220 --> 04:08:42,680
Oh, nice.

3456
04:08:42,980 --> 04:08:44,080
There was an Angela.

3457
04:08:45,080 --> 04:08:45,420
Oh, wait.

3458
04:08:45,500 --> 04:08:46,520
They had Scarlet Witch.

3459
04:08:48,340 --> 04:08:49,120
Oh, my God.

3460
04:08:49,180 --> 04:08:50,220
What is this car?

3461
04:08:53,820 --> 04:08:55,800
What am I playing against right now?

3462
04:08:59,240 --> 04:09:00,940
That's right, pummel him!

3463
04:09:02,420 --> 04:09:03,020
That's right!

3464
04:09:03,800 --> 04:09:04,360
Nice.

3465
04:09:05,480 --> 04:09:07,160
Hello, hello, there is an angel.

3466
04:09:07,300 --> 04:09:09,180
Oh my god, hello, hello, hello!

3467
04:09:09,740 --> 04:09:10,860
Please, please, for the love!

3468
04:09:11,020 --> 04:09:11,860
Hello, team!

3469
04:09:12,000 --> 04:09:13,260
Why are you still frontlining?

3470
04:09:15,620 --> 04:09:18,860
Why is my team still fighting the front line?

3471
04:09:19,280 --> 04:09:21,880
There is three people back there.

3472
04:09:28,420 --> 04:09:29,700
That's bad.

3473
04:09:30,560 --> 04:09:32,820
I'll just play rivals upstream.

3474
04:09:36,100 --> 04:09:36,480
Alright.

3475
04:09:41,660 --> 04:09:42,280
Oh, yo.

3476
04:09:43,720 --> 04:09:44,660
Oh my god, I got clapped.

3477
04:09:44,780 --> 04:09:45,240
I'm clapping.

3478
04:09:45,440 --> 04:09:45,940
I'm clapping.

3479
04:09:47,040 --> 04:09:48,660
Oh my god, nothing will save him.

3480
04:09:49,540 --> 04:09:50,960
No clap will save him.

3481
04:09:51,560 --> 04:09:53,960
Who do I?

3482
04:09:54,660 --> 04:09:55,300
No!

3483
04:09:57,500 --> 04:09:58,460
Oh, it's fine.

3484
04:09:58,680 --> 04:09:59,820
I countered, like...

3485
04:10:01,100 --> 04:10:04,880
Okay, if you were next to me, maybe the whale would have worked.

3486
04:10:05,020 --> 04:10:05,700
I don't know.

3487
04:10:06,400 --> 04:10:06,860
Good luck.

3488
04:10:07,380 --> 04:10:09,360
We have, we have Adam also.

3489
04:10:10,720 --> 04:10:10,800
Right?

3490
04:10:14,260 --> 04:10:14,700
Goodbye.

3491
04:10:16,040 --> 04:10:16,760
You could rest that.

3492
04:10:17,060 --> 04:10:19,040
That would be such a cool time to rest right now.

3493
04:10:19,400 --> 04:10:19,900
You could rest.

3494
04:10:20,000 --> 04:10:20,860
Oh, never mind.

3495
04:10:22,780 --> 04:10:23,220
JK.

3496
04:10:24,960 --> 04:10:26,340
This is so little healing.

3497
04:10:28,080 --> 04:10:28,920
I don't remember I have C.

3498
04:10:29,880 --> 04:10:30,960
I didn't remember that.

3499
04:10:32,180 --> 04:10:34,280
I have, like, my C ability.

3500
04:10:35,860 --> 04:10:37,100
What the fuck is going?

3501
04:10:37,540 --> 04:10:38,420
Did he solo?

3502
04:10:38,760 --> 04:10:40,300
Oh, goodbye.

3503
04:10:41,160 --> 04:10:41,600
It's fine.

3504
04:10:43,180 --> 04:10:45,000
Did I use it accidentally?

3505
04:10:45,260 --> 04:10:45,940
God damn it.

3506
04:10:47,000 --> 04:10:47,520
It's fine.

3507
04:10:48,040 --> 04:10:49,000
It's time to rise.

3508
04:10:50,420 --> 04:10:51,060
It's okay.

3509
04:10:51,520 --> 04:10:52,700
I get resed.

3510
04:10:53,600 --> 04:10:54,020
There you go.

3511
04:10:54,600 --> 04:10:55,560
It's rise time.

3512
04:10:58,320 --> 04:10:59,680
Jesus, a hundred.

3513
04:10:59,880 --> 04:11:18,580
frames this map sucks this map fucking sucks um i think my i think this is a team cop diff again i'm pretty sure oh

3514
04:11:22,160 --> 04:11:29,380
oh shit oh fuck a fucking course i was gonna be like i could take jeff but i'm a lunar duty fuck

3515
04:11:33,460 --> 04:12:00,180
with with that has to be actually i don't actually no it has to be our adam that's saying jeff okay i need our angela to not go in like that like that is not any of the supports fault like that is absolutely not our supports fault for what they're doing like i refuse to believe our supports to blame

3516
04:12:05,180 --> 04:12:07,400
No, it is definitely a team diff.

3517
04:12:08,820 --> 04:12:08,960
Alright.

3518
04:12:14,780 --> 04:12:16,660
No, he just needs to swap off Adam.

3519
04:12:16,920 --> 04:12:17,780
It ain't working.

3520
04:12:20,560 --> 04:12:22,640
This team does not work well with Adam.

3521
04:12:22,800 --> 04:12:24,620
He could literally go Jeff and it would be an improved.

3522
04:12:24,700 --> 04:12:25,320
Oh, shit.

3523
04:12:26,520 --> 04:12:27,940
What the fuck did he do?

3524
04:12:29,120 --> 04:12:32,520
You know, I'll just put it on our name more because he's just flanking, honestly.

3525
04:12:33,460 --> 04:12:34,640
He's literally just flanking.

3526
04:12:35,600 --> 04:12:36,460
He deserves it.

3527
04:12:36,740 --> 04:12:37,820
He earns that spot.

3528
04:12:37,820 --> 04:12:39,300
I'm ready to put on a show.

3529
04:12:40,360 --> 04:12:43,280
Our Angela is the most frontline Angela I've ever seen.

3530
04:12:45,420 --> 04:12:48,220
Oh yeah, that was a good idea.

3531
04:12:49,340 --> 04:12:50,360
There we go.

3532
04:12:52,180 --> 04:12:52,580
Whoa!

3533
04:12:54,060 --> 04:12:56,360
Oh, he jumped back?

3534
04:12:58,620 --> 04:12:59,280
That...

3535
04:13:01,420 --> 04:13:03,400
He jumped back!

3536
04:13:03,460 --> 04:13:36,320

3537
04:13:37,240 --> 04:13:40,820
Oh my god, you swapped off Angela and it was now winnable.

3538
04:13:44,360 --> 04:13:49,100
Oh my god, I literally...

3539
04:13:49,100 --> 04:13:49,460
Please.

3540
04:13:55,180 --> 04:13:56,280
Yeah, you do, right?

3541
04:13:56,400 --> 04:13:56,940
Yeah, I know.

3542
04:13:59,880 --> 04:14:00,740
Please, just use it.

3543
04:14:01,000 --> 04:14:01,820
Please, just use it.

3544
04:14:02,080 --> 04:14:02,460
Just use it.

3545
04:14:02,680 --> 04:14:02,980
Please.

3546
04:14:03,220 --> 04:14:04,640
We lost an Emma!

3547
04:14:04,980 --> 04:14:05,280
Just!

3548
04:14:06,380 --> 04:14:07,420
Okay, that's fine.

3549
04:14:07,600 --> 04:14:08,080
That's still winnable.

3550
04:14:09,160 --> 04:14:09,700
You don't need it.

3551
04:14:10,000 --> 04:14:10,240
Never mind.

3552
04:14:10,860 --> 04:14:11,400
You're so right.

3553
04:14:13,360 --> 04:14:14,100
Just beat him.

3554
04:14:14,100 --> 04:14:14,640
Just beat him up.

3555
04:14:15,080 --> 04:14:16,320
Just beat him up.

3556
04:14:16,760 --> 04:14:18,160
Just beat him up.

3557
04:14:20,760 --> 04:14:22,040
There we go.

3558
04:14:25,100 --> 04:14:25,980
That's crazy.

3559
04:14:26,420 --> 04:14:28,420
I don't think he wanted to lose to a Scarlet Witch.

3560
04:14:36,230 --> 04:14:36,670
Alright.

3561
04:14:41,840 --> 04:14:42,740
What alts do we have?

3562
04:14:42,820 --> 04:14:43,900
Okay, we have...

3563
04:14:43,900 --> 04:15:00,440
I'm just thinking do I wait until do I try run this and let our Adam Res us and then I up or I all because I don't trust him It's such a import come out.

3564
04:15:01,140 --> 04:15:01,360
Oh come out.

3565
04:15:01,780 --> 04:15:02,440
Oh come out.

3566
04:15:04,200 --> 04:15:05,960
Come out.

3567
04:15:06,640 --> 04:15:15,540
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Come on!

3568
04:15:15,660 --> 04:15:16,460
Come on!

3569
04:15:16,560 --> 04:15:16,940
You know what?

3570
04:15:17,180 --> 04:15:18,440
Oh my god.

3571
04:15:18,880 --> 04:15:18,880
Okay.

3572
04:15:19,740 --> 04:15:19,860
Okay.

3573
04:15:21,820 --> 04:15:22,380
Okay.

3574
04:15:22,920 --> 04:15:27,140
I don't know what we're saving it for, but that's fine.

3575
04:15:28,240 --> 04:15:29,360
That's fine.

3576
04:15:33,120 --> 04:15:37,280
The thing is, I don't think I should trust my... I don't know.

3577
04:15:38,780 --> 04:15:39,900
I'm like...

3578
04:15:41,620 --> 04:15:44,480
I'm just gonna use it just because I want...

3579
04:15:45,740 --> 04:15:46,300
That's fine.

3580
04:15:48,940 --> 04:15:49,560
It's fine.

3581
04:15:49,640 --> 04:15:50,220
I have to.

3582
04:15:50,520 --> 04:15:52,540
I'd rather just use it to push through that.

3583
04:15:53,860 --> 04:15:55,820
He's saving it for a Marble Rivals, too.

3584
04:15:56,480 --> 04:15:57,780
That's the only thing I can think of.

3585
04:15:58,300 --> 04:16:00,060
I've just been like, come on, do something.

3586
04:16:00,580 --> 04:16:00,760
Adam.

3587
04:16:01,560 --> 04:16:03,260
I swear to God, Adam, you better be hiding.

3588
04:16:04,220 --> 04:16:07,780
I swear to God, you better hide for this res.

3589
04:16:08,780 --> 04:16:13,120
You've altered one time in this entire game.

3590
04:16:17,500 --> 04:16:20,200
It'll be really cool.

3591
04:16:21,220 --> 04:16:23,700
All right.

3592
04:16:24,620 --> 04:16:26,400
Oh, oh, come on.

3593
04:16:26,860 --> 04:16:30,340
Oh, oh, I swear to God.

3594
04:16:35,280 --> 04:16:36,880
Holy shit.

3595
04:16:43,660 --> 04:16:47,620
I was actually going to go crazy if he fucking decided not to ult again.

3596
04:16:50,780 --> 04:16:52,380
He's like, do something.

3597
04:16:58,400 --> 04:16:59,320
All right, there you go.

3598
04:16:59,940 --> 04:17:00,080
What?

3599
04:17:01,120 --> 04:17:01,820
That's crazy.

3600
04:17:02,000 --> 04:17:05,280
He has had two ults in this entire game.

3601
04:17:05,700 --> 04:17:09,020
Time to switch things up, including which side you're on.

3602
04:17:10,640 --> 04:17:12,040
Yeah, he's just saving him for Ignite.

3603
04:17:12,180 --> 04:17:12,920
I'm Luna Snow.

3604
04:17:13,660 --> 04:17:15,920
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

3605
04:17:16,420 --> 04:17:19,340
The right heroes could- Why the fuck we got off Loki Luna?

3606
04:17:19,440 --> 04:17:21,800
When did we ever have Loki Luna?

3607
04:17:22,340 --> 04:17:24,480
We've never had Loki Luna.

3608
04:17:29,260 --> 04:17:30,000
That's crazy.

3609
04:17:31,620 --> 04:17:35,120
I was like, I don't think I've seen a Loki Luna.

3610
04:17:49,070 --> 04:17:51,870
Ignite starts at 27 for NA.

3611
04:17:52,930 --> 04:17:53,270
I think...

3612
04:17:53,270 --> 04:17:56,910
I don't know if it starts at 27, but I know that it overlaps with...

3613
04:17:57,630 --> 04:17:58,910
What's the best way...

3614
04:18:00,910 --> 04:18:02,230
Trying to fucking kill you.

3615
04:18:03,730 --> 04:18:05,090
That's the best way.

3616
04:18:06,550 --> 04:18:07,750
I always forget the...

3617
04:18:07,750 --> 04:18:09,710
I forget the Adam team up a lot, though.

3618
04:18:12,930 --> 04:18:14,870
Yeah, it's crazy, right?

3619
04:18:14,930 --> 04:18:19,850
When he got off of Angela, and then we started winning, I know.

3620
04:18:20,070 --> 04:18:21,650
It's actually insane.

3621
04:18:23,790 --> 04:18:27,370
It's like Angela's not meta or some shit.

3622
04:18:28,490 --> 04:18:29,950
It's 503, yeah.

3623
04:18:30,910 --> 04:18:31,870
Not that tired.

3624
04:18:32,250 --> 04:18:32,990
I'm having fun too.

3625
04:18:33,110 --> 04:18:33,450
I'm playing Rink.

3626
04:18:35,350 --> 04:18:36,690
I just like... I don't know.

3627
04:18:37,010 --> 04:18:39,230
If I could, I'd just play Rink all the time.

3628
04:18:39,310 --> 04:18:40,550
I'll just stream Rink all the time.

3629
04:18:42,410 --> 04:18:43,910
Because I enjoy it.

3630
04:18:46,230 --> 04:18:46,950
What the fuck?

3631
04:18:47,450 --> 04:18:48,770
Why did they get to have fun?

3632
04:18:50,950 --> 04:18:52,870
I just enjoy Rink a lot.

3633
04:18:53,670 --> 04:18:54,830
Oh, I have to put this on.

3634
04:18:56,290 --> 04:18:58,870
I just remember, since we have an Ultron...

3635
04:19:01,470 --> 04:19:02,810
Ooh, poor guy.

3636
04:19:04,150 --> 04:19:05,910
Because I'm an Ultron, I have to heal.

3637
04:19:06,150 --> 04:19:07,550
Put the snowflake on him.

3638
04:19:08,110 --> 04:19:08,150
No!

3639
04:19:08,670 --> 04:19:10,630
Wait, my third monitor died!

3640
04:19:12,390 --> 04:19:13,570
I can't see Chet!

3641
04:19:16,570 --> 04:19:17,830
Chet's dead!

3642
04:19:18,210 --> 04:19:19,730
And I can't...

3643
04:19:19,730 --> 04:19:21,650
I can't do anything about it.

3644
04:19:24,870 --> 04:19:25,210
Hey.

3645
04:19:27,350 --> 04:19:27,870
Gotta...

3646
04:19:27,870 --> 04:19:30,010
I gotta heal.

3647
04:19:30,910 --> 04:19:31,830
Focus on healing.

3648
04:19:33,270 --> 04:19:34,830
I can't do anything about it.

3649
04:19:39,070 --> 04:19:39,410
Yeah.

3650
04:19:41,570 --> 04:19:42,370
That's fine.

3651
04:19:42,910 --> 04:19:43,570
Team is okay.

3652
04:19:45,990 --> 04:19:46,370
Jesus.

3653
04:19:48,930 --> 04:19:49,530
Oh, this is bad.

3654
04:19:49,650 --> 04:19:50,230
We use Link.

3655
04:19:51,010 --> 04:19:53,270
What if they go do something crazy?

3656
04:19:53,370 --> 04:19:54,270
Because I don't have all...

3657
04:19:54,270 --> 04:19:54,770
Oh, I have all.

3658
04:19:54,910 --> 04:19:55,270
Never mind.

3659
04:19:55,610 --> 04:19:56,010
Doesn't matter.

3660
04:19:57,970 --> 04:19:59,410
I ain't scared now.

3661
04:19:59,550 --> 04:20:00,110
I've got all.

3662
04:20:02,150 --> 04:20:02,930
I ain't scared.

I have to die!

3670
04:22:49,600 --> 04:22:51,120
I can't play this bot.

3671
04:22:52,940 --> 04:22:54,300
Oh, three minutes.

3672
04:22:59,420 --> 04:23:01,800
We have to change the atom.

3673
04:23:03,740 --> 04:23:09,180
It sucks that we're on Ultron 2, because I can't put the snowflake on... on our Namor.

3674
04:23:13,940 --> 04:23:15,420
Where's my other tank?

3675
04:23:16,660 --> 04:23:18,280
Did my other tank go?

3676
04:23:18,420 --> 04:23:19,220

No!

3683
04:25:33,770 --> 04:25:35,710
I judged as much as I could!

3684
04:25:36,350 --> 04:25:44,650
It's not only on CS to play a fucking dumbass third support and doesn't swap off.

3685
04:25:45,770 --> 04:25:49,490
He could have picked any third support, but he picked that third support.

3686
04:25:49,970 --> 04:25:54,530
I am Loki, God of mischief, and the king of Asgard.

3687
04:25:54,790 --> 04:25:57,450
Oh my gosh, I'm trying to fix my third monitor.

3688
04:25:58,390 --> 04:26:00,110
He dragged us through this hill.

3689
04:26:01,710 --> 04:26:08,610
hey remember okay i see it i have my third monitor now my third monitor is on now

3690
04:26:15,860 --> 04:26:37,620

3691
04:26:38,760 --> 04:26:44,480
I'm usually stream on YouTube, but today I am on Twitch because I felt like playing Rink today.

3692
04:26:46,260 --> 04:26:48,940
Uh, this is not winnable, sadly.

3693
04:26:50,080 --> 04:26:53,540
Sadly, we had our, uh, Adam that was throwing.

3694
04:26:54,040 --> 04:26:56,580
Not throwing, but he was trying his best.

3695
04:26:57,060 --> 04:27:00,080
His best wasn't that great, but, you know, it was there.

3696
04:27:00,540 --> 04:27:02,520
I have to- oh, wait, we went to Hawkeye.

3697
04:27:02,920 --> 04:27:04,820
I'll do this for the Hawkeye.

3698
04:27:07,020 --> 04:27:09,370
I don't do this just for the hot guy.

3699
04:27:13,360 --> 04:27:14,200
It's fine.

3700
04:27:14,480 --> 04:27:15,440
Everything is fine.

3701
04:27:16,580 --> 04:27:17,520
Everything will be fine.

3702
04:27:21,680 --> 04:27:22,440
I'll just put it...

3703
04:27:22,440 --> 04:27:23,560
I should put it on him.

3704
04:27:26,600 --> 04:27:27,140
But...

3705
04:27:27,140 --> 04:27:29,540
There should be bigger penalties.

3706
04:27:30,580 --> 04:27:31,160
For a lever.

3707
04:27:32,380 --> 04:27:33,060
Oh my god.

3708
04:27:33,380 --> 04:27:35,560
My third monitor is definitely dying.

3709
04:27:39,560 --> 04:27:41,060
Oh, I would love to heal you.

3710
04:27:42,500 --> 04:27:44,100
But I would love to.

3711
04:27:44,740 --> 04:27:46,360
But you're very far away from us.

3712
04:27:47,240 --> 04:27:49,060
And there is nearly only...

3713
04:27:49,060 --> 04:27:51,240
There's not a lot of us, too.

3714
04:27:51,940 --> 04:27:53,100
Oh, goodbye, Mag.

3715
04:27:53,760 --> 04:27:55,340
Well, um...

3716
04:27:58,420 --> 04:27:58,900
Um...

3717
04:28:00,660 --> 04:28:01,140
Um...

3718
04:28:01,140 --> 04:28:01,480
Um...

3719
04:28:02,540 --> 04:28:03,020
Hmm...

3720
04:28:03,020 --> 04:28:03,820
Hmm...

3721
04:28:10,140 --> 04:28:12,600
I would be very surprised if he gets to touch it.

3722
04:28:12,640 --> 04:28:13,560
Oh, he touches it!

3723
04:28:15,180 --> 04:28:16,800
He's so dead, though.

3724
04:28:22,650 --> 04:28:24,910
He was not winning that.

3725
04:28:27,730 --> 04:28:29,130
That sucks, though.

3726
04:28:30,150 --> 04:28:32,110
We had to play for such a long game.

3727
04:28:33,570 --> 04:28:36,610
I don't think someone he's seeing is reportable.

3728
04:28:37,570 --> 04:28:39,910
The one time I decided to give them my Luna gel.

3729
04:28:40,490 --> 04:28:41,890
The one fucking time.

3730
04:28:44,210 --> 04:28:45,410
I mean, you could do...

3731
04:28:47,130 --> 04:28:47,570
Socials.

3732
04:28:47,810 --> 04:28:48,250
Socials.

3733
04:28:48,410 --> 04:28:48,950
That is my YouTube.

3734
04:28:50,990 --> 04:28:52,270
Can we drop...

3735
04:28:52,270 --> 04:28:53,750
Drawing and Marvel arrive?

3736
04:28:53,830 --> 04:28:54,690
Oh, I do have YouTube.

3737
04:28:55,110 --> 04:28:56,310
I also do have YouTube.

3738
04:29:00,450 --> 04:29:02,490
Wait, that's the actual...

3739
04:29:02,490 --> 04:29:06,970
I don't think it's a good time to talk to us right now when we're losing.

3740
04:29:13,570 --> 04:29:15,090
Well, I don't see you guys.

3741
04:29:15,950 --> 04:29:16,830
I just...

3742
04:29:16,830 --> 04:29:18,250
I just look left.

3743
04:29:18,530 --> 04:29:21,590
Because I have to tap to my other miner.

3744
04:29:28,930 --> 04:29:30,290
Guys, I don't think it's winnable.

3745
04:29:39,050 --> 04:29:41,050
I don't think it's winnable, guys.

3746
04:29:42,970 --> 04:29:46,370
Should I lose less?

3747
04:29:47,870 --> 04:29:48,190
Um...

3748
04:29:48,190 --> 04:29:51,130
I don't remember what change they made.

3749
04:29:51,790 --> 04:29:55,350
But, like, I don't think it's, like, that much of a...

3750
04:29:55,350 --> 04:29:58,030
I haven't had a game yet where I had a lever.

3751
04:29:58,610 --> 04:29:59,430
That's the thing.

3752
04:29:59,810 --> 04:30:23,570
had a game where well goodbye strange where well goodbye oh my god oh my god i still he's still there that's crazy welcome back strange welcome goodbye strange please

3753
04:30:31,720 --> 04:30:35,080
Oh my god, oh my god, a little strange!

3754
04:30:36,740 --> 04:30:42,300
The fact that he lived through all of that is absolutely crazy.

3755
04:30:42,980 --> 04:30:45,680
He was meant to die 20 years ago.

3756
04:30:47,060 --> 04:30:52,660
He was not supposed to...

3757
04:30:53,320 --> 04:30:57,360
It was not... Oh my god, I don't think it's okay anymore.

3758
04:30:58,100 --> 04:30:59,920
I don't think so.

3759
04:31:01,660 --> 04:31:04,800
The sign of just keeping Strange alive does not work.

3760
04:31:11,280 --> 04:31:15,220
Bro, he's hanging on.

3761
04:31:15,740 --> 04:31:18,820
Strange actually hanged on for so long.

3762
04:31:24,910 --> 04:31:26,190
That's crazy.

3763
04:31:31,830 --> 04:31:33,230
Alright, how much do I lose?

3764
04:31:33,690 --> 04:31:36,610
This was like the first time I've had a game with a lever.

3765
04:31:38,450 --> 04:31:39,490
Minus 13.

3766
04:31:39,630 --> 04:31:40,990
Yeah, that's not ain't so bad.

3767
04:31:41,530 --> 04:31:43,690
Alright, now it's time to see.

3768
04:31:44,210 --> 04:31:44,770
Minus 7!

3769
04:31:45,010 --> 04:31:45,950
Who the f-

3770
04:31:49,030 --> 04:31:50,650
Excuse- I- How?

3771
04:31:51,210 --> 04:31:52,250
Excuse me?

3772
04:31:52,530 --> 04:31:54,350
How does he get minus 7?

3773
04:31:54,730 --> 04:31:56,490
This is absolutely bullshit.

3774
04:31:56,570 --> 04:31:57,490
I'm angry now.

3775
04:31:57,870 --> 04:31:59,930
I was like, oh, minus 13.

3776
04:32:00,050 --> 04:32:01,990
And then he's like, I got minus 7.

3777
04:32:02,230 --> 04:32:05,210
Oh my god, why are you in my lobby?

3778
04:32:06,190 --> 04:32:08,870
Wait, wait, is that diamond or- Wait, is that Platte?

3779
04:32:09,590 --> 04:32:10,350
Is that Platte?

3780
04:32:10,450 --> 04:32:11,330
Is that...

3781
04:32:14,210 --> 04:32:15,250
No, that's...

3782
04:32:15,250 --> 04:32:17,210
Is that... That's Platte.

3783
04:32:17,690 --> 04:32:18,570
Wait, is that Platte?

3784
04:32:21,810 --> 04:32:23,770
That's... How are you in my lobby?

3785
04:32:23,850 --> 04:32:25,010
I don't understand.

3786
04:32:26,650 --> 04:32:28,490
Okay, now, now I understand.

3787
04:32:29,610 --> 04:32:30,970
No one else is Platte.

3788
04:32:32,630 --> 04:32:33,510
That's crazy.

3789
04:32:33,930 --> 04:32:35,670
No one else was Platte on the enemy team.

3790
04:32:35,910 --> 04:32:36,630
Who are you?

3791
04:32:37,070 --> 04:32:38,310
Are you doing... You're not...

3792
04:32:38,330 --> 04:32:40,670
How are you in that line?

3793
04:32:43,250 --> 04:32:48,390
All right, now it's time to see if I lose diamond one or I get that or or not.

3794
04:32:48,950 --> 04:32:49,770
I was like, what?

3795
04:32:50,550 --> 04:32:51,070
Minus seven.

3796
04:32:51,370 --> 04:32:51,830
That's okay.

3797
04:32:55,690 --> 04:32:57,550
What do you mean, minus seven?

3798
04:33:09,390 --> 04:33:10,430
That's crazy.

3799
04:33:11,510 --> 04:33:13,110
I was like, excuse me.

3800
04:33:13,790 --> 04:33:15,770
See, I did not sign up for that.

3801
04:33:16,710 --> 04:33:18,290
I did not sign up.

3802
04:33:18,430 --> 04:33:26,550
to have this plot disgusting in my lobby

3803
04:33:30,840 --> 04:33:34,560

3806
04:34:40,910 --> 04:34:42,590
What is he trying to do with the Luna?

3807
04:34:42,830 --> 04:34:44,270
What is this freak trying to do?

3808
04:34:46,510 --> 04:34:47,130
Freak!

3809
04:34:49,690 --> 04:34:56,090

3810
04:34:56,770 --> 04:35:03,230
What are Okay, they're just building a sandcastle.

3811
04:35:03,410 --> 04:35:03,790
Okay, that's good.

3812
04:35:04,210 --> 04:35:04,730
Nothing freaky.

3813
04:35:05,230 --> 04:35:07,050
They're just building sandcastle.

3814
04:35:07,430 --> 04:35:09,270
Okay, that's less freaky.

3815
04:35:10,450 --> 04:35:13,370
I was gonna be a little concerned.

3816
04:35:14,730 --> 04:35:15,890
I was gonna be a little concerned.

3817
04:35:16,010 --> 04:35:17,250
I thought he was gonna be a little creep.

3818
04:35:18,490 --> 04:35:18,950
It's okay.

3819
04:35:19,070 --> 04:35:22,030
Look, they're just washing his hair.

3820
04:35:22,710 --> 04:35:23,230
Oh!

3821
04:35:25,450 --> 04:35:27,410
What happened to peace and love?

3822
04:35:30,590 --> 04:35:31,030
Oh my God.

3823
04:35:31,190 --> 04:35:31,990
I don't think he saw me.

3824
04:35:36,030 --> 04:35:37,230
What happened?

3825
04:35:43,040 --> 04:35:44,860
No peace or love.

3826
04:35:46,620 --> 04:35:48,420
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

3827
04:35:51,040 --> 04:35:55,460
Alright, while the Insta torch, I don't want to play out.

3828
04:35:56,280 --> 04:36:00,240
Do I trust in my torch to let him play torch?

3829
04:36:00,340 --> 04:36:02,800
Because it's literally whoever has the better torch player.

3830
04:36:04,720 --> 04:36:05,960
Do you think...

3831
04:36:05,960 --> 04:36:07,560
We have the better torch player.

3832
04:36:16,920 --> 04:36:19,840
I personally do not think we have a better torch player.

3833
04:36:29,910 --> 04:36:32,350
I think, I think it's over.

3834
04:36:41,200 --> 04:36:41,740
Jeff.

3835
04:36:42,500 --> 04:36:42,800
What?

3836
04:36:43,700 --> 04:36:45,360
It's because our guy picked Jeff.

3837
04:36:47,260 --> 04:36:47,680
Scarlet?

3838
04:36:47,760 --> 04:36:49,160
What the fuck is...

3839
04:36:49,160 --> 04:36:51,320
Okay, this is actually that many, though.

3840
04:36:51,860 --> 04:36:54,980
Now why are we banning Jeff and Scarlet?

3841
04:36:55,420 --> 04:36:58,420
What are these bads?

3842
04:37:03,500 --> 04:37:04,820
I don't think.

3843
04:37:05,780 --> 04:37:07,480
I'll go to Luna jail.

3844
04:37:09,360 --> 04:37:10,840
I'll go to Luna jail.

3845
04:37:10,960 --> 04:37:13,840
I'll try, I guess.

3846
04:37:14,580 --> 04:37:17,260
I guess I'll try.

3847
04:37:26,850 --> 04:37:28,570
That's fine.

3848
04:37:31,210 --> 04:37:32,690
I suppose.

3849
04:37:40,750 --> 04:37:42,150
All right, here we go.

3850
04:37:44,150 --> 04:37:45,410
Music makes people happy.

3851
04:37:46,290 --> 04:37:46,930
Watch this.

3852
04:37:47,130 --> 04:37:47,490
Who's that?

3853
04:37:48,110 --> 04:37:48,230
Namor?

3854
04:37:49,810 --> 04:37:51,110
Oh my god.

3855
04:37:51,650 --> 04:37:52,870
The rumors were true.

3856
04:37:56,330 --> 04:37:58,950
The rumors were true, guys.

3857
04:38:00,030 --> 04:38:02,110
This is but a temporary alliance.

3858
04:38:02,690 --> 04:38:06,940
How old to join your mutant brethren on Kokoa?

3859
04:38:08,320 --> 04:38:10,380
I knew he fucked fishes.

3860
04:38:11,460 --> 04:38:12,800
I knew it.

3861
04:38:13,260 --> 04:38:17,800
All right.

3862
04:38:19,260 --> 04:38:20,000
Off we go.

3863
04:38:26,290 --> 04:38:27,590
Oh, you guys didn't know that?

3864
04:38:31,670 --> 04:38:33,750
It's in the...

3865
04:38:34,990 --> 04:38:36,470
Oh, damn, I have this.

3866
04:38:37,890 --> 04:38:39,450
Oh, what a waste of your shield.

3867
04:38:40,390 --> 04:38:41,750
Because I know that...

3868
04:38:43,690 --> 04:38:46,230
Like, why would you waste your shield right away?

3869
04:38:46,650 --> 04:38:47,030
There.

3870
04:38:52,070 --> 04:38:52,410
So what?

3871
04:38:52,530 --> 04:38:53,170
I got you!

3872
04:38:54,090 --> 04:38:55,030
I'm a hero!

3873
04:38:59,490 --> 04:39:00,890
Oh, there's a squirrel, bro.

3874
04:39:05,230 --> 04:39:06,070
It's fine.

3875
04:39:06,230 --> 04:39:06,830
They're fine.

3876
04:39:07,410 --> 04:39:08,450
I believe in them.

3877
04:39:09,050 --> 04:39:10,010
Not... Oh, nice.

3878
04:39:10,270 --> 04:39:11,350
Our silo lives too.

3879
04:39:11,830 --> 04:39:12,450
That's right!

3880
04:39:12,690 --> 04:39:12,950
She is!

3881
04:39:12,970 --> 04:39:14,190
Yeah, support players!

3882
04:39:14,850 --> 04:39:15,630
That's me!

3883
04:39:16,730 --> 04:39:17,290
What the fuck?

3884
04:39:17,470 --> 04:39:19,390
Are you just letting her meditate like that?

3885
04:39:19,770 --> 04:39:21,770
Because please don't stand on the...

3886
04:39:21,770 --> 04:39:24,190
Please don't stand on the Squirrel Girl shit.

3887
04:39:24,730 --> 04:39:26,850
Please don't... don't just stand there.

3888
04:39:27,730 --> 04:39:28,230
Please?

3889
04:39:28,730 --> 04:39:31,990
It's not that hard to dodge Squirrel Girl.

3890
04:39:32,970 --> 04:39:34,030
I'm gonna say that and I'm gonna go...

3891
04:39:34,030 --> 04:39:36,070
I'm gonna get like fucking trapped by the Squirrel Girl.

3892
04:39:36,590 --> 04:39:37,310
I can feel it.

3893
04:39:37,970 --> 04:39:39,330
I feel karma right now.

3894
04:39:40,030 --> 04:39:42,450
I feel karma waiting to happen to me.

3895
04:39:45,430 --> 04:40:16,120
I'm just gonna back up push up push up our sidelog got push up I swear to god I swear to god if I oh my god we altered that we all we actually altered that that's actual PTSD for that one person I don't want to use it yet just because I know I can save him it's because I know he has straight so I'm just trying not to waste it.

3896
04:40:16,490 --> 04:40:17,190
There you go.

3897
04:40:18,150 --> 04:40:18,990
Okay, he's not gonna live that.

3898
04:40:19,390 --> 04:40:19,490
Unless?

3899
04:40:19,990 --> 04:40:20,150
Unless?

3900
04:40:22,250 --> 04:40:23,770
Oh my god!

3901
04:40:24,250 --> 04:40:24,470
Oh!

3902
04:40:24,890 --> 04:40:25,170
Whoa!

3903
04:40:25,950 --> 04:40:26,030
Whoa!

3904
04:40:26,410 --> 04:40:26,710
Nice.

3905
04:40:28,590 --> 04:40:29,130
Nice.

3906
04:40:29,630 --> 04:40:29,870
Okay.

3907
04:40:30,530 --> 04:40:31,050
All right.

3908
04:40:31,150 --> 04:40:32,230
Okay, that's not good.

3909
04:40:32,550 --> 04:40:32,610
Oh.

3910
04:40:33,550 --> 04:40:35,550
I don't think we're gonna live, Sue.

3911
04:40:36,030 --> 04:40:36,310
All right.

3912
04:40:37,450 --> 04:40:38,090
It's okay.

3913
04:40:38,230 --> 04:40:39,110
Sue's still alive.

3914
04:40:42,730 --> 04:40:46,210
Oh man, I hope he can, he just needs to stop what?

3915
04:40:47,830 --> 04:40:55,550
Yeah, I was gonna say, I, unless the Sioux, like, saves my ass there, I did not think I was gonna win.

3916
04:40:56,490 --> 04:41:01,910
I had three people pummeling my ass, beating up, beating me up, kicking me down.

3917
04:41:06,910 --> 04:41:09,030
Oh, now he, oh wait, that's a different person, I was like, nine, nine.

3918
04:41:09,110 --> 04:41:11,110
I was thinking about GGG.

3919
04:41:16,520 --> 04:41:16,600
All right.

3920
04:41:18,220 --> 04:41:19,220
Yes, bro, go up.

3921
04:41:21,160 --> 04:41:22,720
I'm gonna try my best.

3922
04:41:24,960 --> 04:41:25,700
He's okay.

3923
04:41:27,600 --> 04:41:28,160
Okay.

3924
04:41:28,800 --> 04:41:30,380
We're five, I think.

3925
04:41:35,000 --> 04:41:35,720
Just...

3926
04:41:35,720 --> 04:41:39,320
Please, please, why would you run away from me?

3927
04:41:43,940 --> 04:41:47,380
All you had to do was stay with me.

3928
04:41:50,260 --> 04:41:50,820
Why?

3929
04:41:51,320 --> 04:41:53,540
You had one job.

3930
04:41:54,140 --> 04:41:56,480
Oh, but God, and you all sit with two people.

3931
04:41:56,680 --> 04:41:57,260
Okay, it's fine.

3932
04:41:57,540 --> 04:41:58,260
Paul's got this.

3933
04:41:58,880 --> 04:42:00,740
Paul, go, Paul, go.

3934
04:42:05,920 --> 04:42:07,120
Go, Paul, go.

3935
04:42:10,910 --> 04:42:11,970
Go, Paul.

3936
04:42:13,590 --> 04:42:14,530
That's bad.

3937
04:42:15,630 --> 04:42:16,090
Oh, my God.

3938
04:42:16,250 --> 04:42:17,450
Paul's actually doing it.

3939
04:42:22,220 --> 04:42:24,860
Oh my god, Paul cannot do this forever, though.

3940
04:42:25,580 --> 04:42:26,980
Paul really couldn't do this forever.

3941
04:42:28,480 --> 04:42:30,160
But he still got the spirit.

3942
04:42:32,660 --> 04:42:33,940
Oh no, no!

3943
04:42:34,860 --> 04:42:35,620
Oh my god, thank god.

3944
04:42:35,880 --> 04:42:36,800
Thank god I have a shield.

3945
04:42:41,950 --> 04:42:42,370
Nice.

3946
04:42:44,570 --> 04:42:45,630
I didn't have to waste my health.

3947
04:42:47,650 --> 04:42:48,390
Oh, thank god.

3948
04:42:48,570 --> 04:42:49,410
That was a good...

3949
04:42:49,410 --> 04:42:51,170
That was a good...

3950
04:42:51,170 --> 04:42:51,930
Good alt there.

3951
04:42:54,310 --> 04:42:58,210
They actually, the rocket and Loki died with their ult, which is good.

3952
04:43:01,770 --> 04:43:02,890
Thank God.

3953
04:43:06,680 --> 04:43:08,860
Bro, I still got ulted.

3954
04:43:09,760 --> 04:43:12,160
I don't think it did anything.

3955
04:43:12,460 --> 04:43:15,420
I still, it's the invisible wall that saved me.

3956
04:43:15,520 --> 04:43:17,860
Like, she luckily put a wall between all of us.

3957
04:43:18,420 --> 04:43:20,040
Um, so, like, we lived that.

3958
04:43:20,900 --> 04:43:21,980
I wouldn't say it's the boop.

3959
04:43:22,560 --> 04:43:23,980
I would say it's the wall.

3960
04:43:24,160 --> 04:43:26,520
Like this wall that she did.

3961
04:43:29,180 --> 04:43:29,560
Oh, Paul.

3962
04:43:29,800 --> 04:43:30,540
He's our man.

3963
04:43:30,780 --> 04:43:31,760
No one can do it.

3964
04:43:31,860 --> 04:43:32,580
Guess we're fucked.

3965
04:43:34,000 --> 04:43:34,440
Oh, Paul.

3966
04:43:35,300 --> 04:43:35,940
I'm bricked.

3967
04:43:36,420 --> 04:43:37,380
Good for him.

3968
04:43:38,240 --> 04:43:40,500
I can't believe people have already copied.

3969
04:43:41,040 --> 04:43:42,860
Did a fucking code for that.

3970
04:43:43,940 --> 04:43:44,540
Oh, Paul.

3971
04:43:45,720 --> 04:43:46,280
Right, boy.

3972
04:43:46,400 --> 04:43:47,960
Thank you for the tier one, so thank you.

3973
04:43:51,880 --> 04:43:52,460
Let's go.

3974
04:43:55,900 --> 04:43:57,360
Let's go, Paul!

3975
04:44:03,930 --> 04:44:06,530
Alright, we chill like that.

3976
04:44:09,950 --> 04:44:12,630
Don't worry, hey guys, maybe we should help Paul.

3977
04:44:14,190 --> 04:44:17,230
Paul seems to be trying to do this himself.

3978
04:44:20,900 --> 04:44:22,660
Might be a good idea.

3979
04:44:26,340 --> 04:44:26,940
Yay!

3980
04:44:27,820 --> 04:44:29,180
I don't know, I didn't trust my idea.

3981
04:44:29,200 --> 04:44:35,320
walk up just keep beating him up hey

3982
04:44:38,600 --> 04:45:33,680
guys okay okay guys all right good job good job team good good job I'm just like excuse me why am I the only one jabbing the foot oh I am the only one with self-awareness apparently like I have to use my clap because my support couldn't get to me that sucks I feel like I wasted this I felt like I wasted a clap there nice okay I'm okay less nice less nice okay not nice because I didn't realize he was gonna die I The point is just merely a suggestion.

3983
04:45:34,680 --> 04:45:39,220
It was less nice.

3984
04:45:43,000 --> 04:45:46,020
I'm gonna make sure he's fully healed.

3985
04:45:46,780 --> 04:45:48,220
Before I...

3986
04:45:51,420 --> 04:45:52,560
Alright, it's fine.

3987
04:45:53,460 --> 04:45:55,460
I am tempted to...

3988
04:45:56,540 --> 04:45:57,220
Hmm...

3989
04:45:57,220 --> 04:45:58,880
Actually, I don't know.

3990
04:45:58,880 --> 04:46:04,500
Because if I play Cloak, it makes them waste a Magog for me.

3991
04:46:05,140 --> 04:46:10,240
So then our other guy would be fine.

3992
04:46:11,680 --> 04:46:12,440
Don't worry, Hulk.

3993
04:46:12,660 --> 04:46:14,360
All I'm doing is healing you.

3994
04:46:15,240 --> 04:46:16,200
That is all right.

3995
04:46:17,660 --> 04:46:18,740
What the fuck?

3996
04:46:20,020 --> 04:46:21,640
Why would you not beg for heals?

3997
04:46:24,080 --> 04:46:25,200
Alright, guys.

3998
04:46:25,460 --> 04:46:27,800
It would be great if we could push up.

3999
04:46:28,880 --> 04:46:29,900
just a little bit.

4000
04:46:30,460 --> 04:46:32,140
It'll be so cool.

4001
04:46:32,760 --> 04:46:33,640
If we can stop.

4002
04:46:34,480 --> 04:46:35,080
Oh my god.

4003
04:46:35,320 --> 04:46:37,560
I actually almost pressed you there.

4004
04:46:38,820 --> 04:46:39,280
There we go.

4005
04:46:40,720 --> 04:46:41,300
Hey guys.

4006
04:46:41,440 --> 04:46:42,360
Hey guys.

4007
04:46:42,680 --> 04:46:43,740
Hey guys.

4008
04:46:44,480 --> 04:46:44,480
Hey.

4009
04:46:57,480 --> 04:46:58,060
Okay.

4010
04:47:07,790 --> 04:47:08,850
I was so tempted.

4011
04:47:09,090 --> 04:47:10,690
I was gonna use voice there.

4012
04:47:11,270 --> 04:47:32,990
I was that close to using voice and be like, guys, do we really just leave us like our mag literally walk back the past the strange now now you healers got you healers can't kill a stranger right you got this you know that was crazy that was actually crazy

That was actually the wildest thing I've ever saw.

4016
04:48:02,060 --> 04:48:09,700
Like, I did not expect my entire fucking team to just walk past the strain.

4017
04:48:11,240 --> 04:48:15,040
It just looked like, how did that happen?

4018
04:48:17,910 --> 04:48:21,790

Yeah, don't worry.

4036
04:52:05,020 --> 04:52:09,440
The fact that he alts it and then no one turned around.

4037
04:52:11,560 --> 04:52:13,920
Okay, I need a no, okay.

4038

Alright, let's see you walk past this guy.

4039
04:52:23,520 --> 04:52:24,620
Oh, okay, he turned around.

4040
04:52:24,780 --> 04:52:25,220
Thank God.

4041
04:52:25,660 --> 04:52:27,540
Oh, but did you have shield?

4042
04:52:27,740 --> 04:52:28,840
Did you have shield?

4043
04:52:29,940 --> 04:52:31,320
He was so lucky.

4044
04:52:31,620 --> 04:52:31,880
He was...

4045
04:52:32,680 --> 04:52:33,920

4046
04:52:35,780 --> 04:52:37,220
Oh, he had no shield.

4047
04:52:37,480 --> 04:52:38,140
He had no shield.

4048
04:52:38,300 --> 04:52:40,640
Oh my god, we were that close to dying.

4049
04:52:41,140 --> 04:52:45,020
We were so close.

4050
04:52:46,840 --> 04:52:48,160
I can't believe it.

4051
04:52:48,360 --> 04:52:49,100
They just...

4052
04:52:49,100 --> 04:52:51,060
At least a mag turn around.

4053
04:52:51,220 --> 04:52:53,120
You know, you know, I'll give him that.

4054
04:52:53,220 --> 04:52:55,980
He turned around, but he still let that happen.

4055
04:52:56,240 --> 04:52:57,660
He let that happen.

4056
04:53:03,060 --> 04:53:51,960
that's crazy oh my god i mean we were positive we went positive today which is good that's always a good thing um i was mostly fucking around more than actually i mean yeah i was mostly fucking around than actually trying harding today uh i mean i feel like every time i stream i was fucking around but uh i felt like i thought we had some good games i get to play jeff i got learn how to get better at jeff i think i don't know i really need to watch a pro player play i need to watch like pro pro streams of jeff just to figure it out because i don't know how to play them i just i'm just assuming that i'm doing the right thing i think i'm fucking terrible at y'all that's for sure i i feel like i need i need um i feel like um what the fuck is this guy i

4057
04:53:57,080 --> 04:54:03,380

4058
04:54:03,660 --> 04:54:07,640
Like, I could be, like, protected from them trying to burst me.

4059
04:54:08,960 --> 04:54:10,680
But, yeah, thank you, everybody, for watching.

I usually stream on YouTube, but today I'm here on Twitch because I felt like...

4063
04:54:17,420 --> 04:54:18,320
No, I haven't fed him yet.

4064
04:54:18,500 --> 04:54:19,540
I'm not going to feed him early.

4065
04:54:19,720 --> 04:54:26,460
He's usually fed at 6.30, and I don't want to try and feed him early just because I don't want to enable it.

4066
04:54:26,880 --> 04:54:33,620
it to i don't want to enable him waking me up early in the morning for food because if i feed him at 5 30 he's gonna start waking up at 5 30.
