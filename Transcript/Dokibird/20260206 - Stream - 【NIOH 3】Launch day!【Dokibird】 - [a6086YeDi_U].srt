1
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,230
Oh, where am I?

2
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,750
Give me a sec.

3
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,150
Oh, there you are.

4
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,030
Everybody, hello, hello.

5
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,930
Before I say anything, I'm gonna boot up Neo3 right now
because we waited enough time.

6
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,090
We waited five hours for this game.

7
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,350
So I'm just gonna boot it up right now.

8
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,230
I don't know if sound...

9
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,690
Oh, so I'm still moving.

10
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,790
Ooh, that's awkward.

11
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,790
Give me a sec.

12
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,990
I should not be moving right now.

13
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,150
I'm zooming in.

15
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,530
Let me, let me fix this real quick, guys.

16
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,610
Like, I'll fix this.

17
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,710
Um, poop.

18
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,910
All right.

19
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,950
Sorry, I've been in, today's been really rough for my throat
today.

20
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,690
I've been coughing a lot today.

21
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,150
So, uh, today's a bad day for my cough.

22
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:36,830
Anyway, so legitimately, um, uh, yesterday, apparently for
those who didn't know, yesterday, uh, they changed the

23
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,190
release.

24
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:46,150
date and obviously I researched the release date before you
know before I make my schedule and on steam it was supposed

25
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,190
to release at 5 p.m.

26
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:58,530
PST on the fifth and then apparently 24 hours ago they
changed the release date to 9 p.m.

27
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:06,870
PST like just out of nowhere because on the steam it tells
you what time the release dates were and i even googled what

28
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:15,450
time does neo3 release and uh and then they were like
surprise we're gonna push it back a little bit to midnight

29
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:27,310
instead uh so uh so that's why uh so i was just like fuck it
i guess i guess more time to get some behind the scenes work

30
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:35,310
done i guess um because i was debating whether or not to do
the demo and then play the full game But I was a little like

31
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,250
paranoid.

32
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,870
I was just like, oh, what if the demo is a bit different
from the actual full game itself?

33
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,830
So I was like, oh my gosh, I'd rather just experience it
live of the actual game itself than go with the demo.

34
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,710
Because I don't know.

35
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,630
I don't know.

36
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:53,070
Like I looked at the demo seemed to have like 800 patch
notes every time they release a demo.

37
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,670
So I was just like, I didn't know.

38
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,990
And I did want it to stream today.

39
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,250
I still wanted to stream this.

40
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,050
I was just like, fuck it.

41
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,850
I'll just wait until 9 p.m.

42
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,450
to do the stream.

43
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,810
Late night stream today.

44
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,610
I don't know how long I'm going to be playing this game for.

45
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:11,970
It does.

46
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,150
It is a souls like.

47
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,590
I have never played the Neo series.

48
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,590
I have always wanted to play the Neo series.

49
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,470
So, you know, instead of starting from one, we're going to
go straight into three.

50
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,330
I hope that me not having any of the background knowledge
isn't going to fuck me over.

51
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,770
And they'll have a little small recap for me.

52
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,610
So I know what the fuck is going on.

53
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,290
Oh, shit, wait.

54
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,490
Wait, can I go back?

55
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,270
Wait, I won't.

56
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,950
No, I don't want to read.

57
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,210
It's 9 p.m.

58
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,970
Oh, that's so awkward.

59
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,910
Oh, that's awkward.

60
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,250
Okay, that's okay.

61
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,310
120.

62
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,450
I'll do 120.

63
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,370
Like, it's 60 is fine.

64
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,710
Actually, I don't know if it's fine.

65
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:57,730
Actually, I don't know.

66
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,330
It is a so-and-I don't really...

67
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,890
FPS dynamic.

68
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,110
To adjust.

69
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:12,370
up to the value set to maintain what the fuck what is that
what is FPS adjustment guys I've never heard of that before

70
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:22,530
what is that thing is I feel like this game is gonna fucking
kill my PC so that's why I'm willing to play on 60 frames

71
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:32,990
what is FPS dynamic adjustment I have never heard of this
setting before it makes the game looks worse if you lose we

72
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:41,070
turn that on or off i i've never i swear i've never seen
this setting before um no it says like well dynamic adjusts

73
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:48,790
up to a valid set in the fame rate cap to maintain
performance that makes zero sense to me uh like i'm sorry

74
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:56,290
but that doesn't make any sense like i don't know the way
they worded that makes no sense to me i'm like english

75
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:02,790
please english Speak English, please.

76
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,150
Jesus, Chris, why is there so many motion blur settings?

77
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,510
Motion quality.

78
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,490
Wait, that's not motion blur.

79
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,950
This is motion blur.

80
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,830
What the fuck is motion quality then?

81
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,470
Although, I think this is fine.

82
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,890
I have no idea what motion quality is, but apparently it's
different from motion blur.

83
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,270
So I hope that's all right.

84
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,550
All right, I think that should be good.

85
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:38,650
your controls i mean unless i i assume that because it is a
soul's leg i will not need to use mouse and keyboard because

86
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:50,950
i assume that screen shake turn that off i'm i'm sorry i'm
not a fan of screen shake uh in general standard i will have

87
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,690
bigger subtitles oh my gosh yeah bigger please

88
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:06,890
I saw somebody it kept showing up in my youtube shorts, but
someone was doing the they were doing a boxing build in

89
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:12,730
Elden Ring And they were literally like the control was
literally beating up a little boxing dummy It was actually

90
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,450
really fucking cool.

91
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:23,450
I was watching him fight millennia with the boxing with the
boxing setup is so cool like Like kicks would do one thing

92
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:29,750
like we boxed it you touched the tap top of the head it
heals It was actually crazy and it was like one shot to it's

93
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:36,870
like one of those builds where if you get hit once you're
fucked i think that's good save settings do you want to

94
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:48,390
finish configuring all right yeah sure hello whoa all right

too fast subtitle skip cutscenes Oh, I passed it.

99
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,190
Was it an audio?

100
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,270
No.

101
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:36,830
Visuals?

102
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,730
Oh, my God.

103
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,430
Where was it?

104
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,170
Oh, language!

105
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,150
Okay, there we go.

106
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,150
There we go.

107
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,510
Alright, let's check this game out.

108
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,810
That's cute, though.

109
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,870
Not the... Okay, the eyes are a little bit too big on the
fucking...

110
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,590
Oh, my God.

111
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,970
Look at that baby's head.

112
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,950
That's like Jimmy Neutron shit.

113
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,310
Anyway, let's play the game.

114
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:00,890
Like I said, I hope me not knowing whatever...

115
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,810
What the fuck happened in Neo 1 or 2?

116
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,030
Um, isn't gonna fuck me over.

117
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,150
Shining stones imbued with human kinds, never-ending dreams.

118
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:19,610
Their radiance Harbors two kinds of power.

119
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,020
The first is that of total destruction.

120
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,020
Yeah, I hope like, story's not that important.

121
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,720
Oh.

122
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:41,740
The second is the power of rebirth that nurtures and heals
life.

123
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,630
Since time immemorial.

124
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:59,210
I mean, the fact that my skin suit isn't lagging like crazy
right now, that's a win in my book.

125
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,090
You know, usually a lot of games on launch.

126
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,370
The moment I booted up the game, like I'd be on like five
frames per second.

127
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,710
And the fact that I am not, I call that a win.

128
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,190
Like, this is my personal stress test.

129
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,890
Good sign so far.

130
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,330
The fact that I'm not five frames per second.

131
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,590
Brady, thank you for the super chat.

132
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,190

Thank you.

Just super as a pre-celebration of me asking my girlfriend
to marry me.

135
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,050
The ring is currently on the way.

136
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,230
Oh my god.

137
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,710

Was the same appearance.

149
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,440
Changing would discard your current weight.

150
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,980
Yeah, yes please.

151
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,020

Alright, that's preset.

I'm gonna make you guys.

168
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:02,940
Alright.

169
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,500
And then, head size.

170
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,720
And then... We gotta make sure we don't get headshot.

171
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,080
We gotta reduce it.

172
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,520
Actually, no, that's... Never mind.

173
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,020
Never mind.

174
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,000
I think this is perfect, actually.

175
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,720
This is perfect.

176
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,660
Let's see.

177
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,440
Alright.

178
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,620

00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:30,860
Actually.

181
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,120
We look better.

182
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,400
Smaller hitbox means.

183
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:34,920
Exactly.

184
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,840
Smaller hitbox means less damage.

185
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:38,800
Alright.

186
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,680
Okay.

187
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,580
We didn't practice our arm game.

188
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,040
But.

189
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,580
We did work on our legs.

190
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,020
It's alright.

191
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,220
Alright.

192
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:48,780
Alright.

193
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,160

00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,180
Oh, yeah, there we go.

00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,500
We gotta be cheeked up.

201
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,080
Want them to know.

202
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,000
Let's see.

203
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:37,940
There we go.

204
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,880
We gotta be cheeked up, guys.

205
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,700
If we have it, we gotta be able to flex it, you know?

206
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,160
What's this?

207
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,880
Oh, tattoo.

208
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,720
Oh, do we get a trap stamp?

209
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,420
Where do we put...

210
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,020
Where is that?

211
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,260
Oh.

212
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,620
On our belly button.

213
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,600
Okay, give me a sec.

214
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,420
Let's put a trap stamp in the back, too.

215
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,740
I don't have to move my... Okay, wait.

216
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,760
Back?

217
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,680
Alright, let's put the trap stamp behind us.

218
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,780
Oh, it has to be a flower.

219
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,320
That's the perfect stamp.

220
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,720
Alright, let's see.

221
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,540
Where is the... There we go.

222
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,380
Alright, here.

223
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,200
And then we'll...

224
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,220
Lower it?

225
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,140
Right here.

226
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,800
Not the trap staff.

227
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,580
Alright, here we go.

228
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,060
And then...

229
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,880
Ooh, it can make it shiny.

230
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,200
Wait, how does it...

231
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,380
How does that work?

232
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,280
It's a shine.

233
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,920
Alright, let's do that.

234
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,780
Unfortunately, I can't lower it.

235
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,040
I can't lower it anymore.

236
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,020
There we go.

237
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,500
I think that's perfect, honestly.

238
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,480
Alright.

239
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,480
Lower body marking.

240
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,220
Oh, it's for the legs.

241
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,520
Where is it, though?

242
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,680
Oh, it's right here.

243
00:15:52,920 --> 00:16:02,840
They do say I don't know if you guys know this But I think
it's like an Asian What is the word called?

244
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:11,260
An Asian myth thing Where if you have a mole On any part of
your body And it's like a birthmark type mole That was how

245
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:24,270
you died in your previous life So We should add this And
then add it Let's see Let's see Wait, where is it?

246
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,270
Wait, where is it going?

247
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:29,710
All right, there we go.

248
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,950
We should have it.

249
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,770
I want to go higher, but it's not going higher.

250
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,270
Why is it?

251
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:37,990
Oh, shit.

252
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,730
Okay, never mind.

253
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,150
That's not where it's supposed to.

254
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:40,770
All right.

255
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,050
All right.

256
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,070
So we'll...

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,210
Right?

259
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,510
They're not even going to be able to see this because it's
right here.

260
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:14,610
That's how you died in your previous life The weakest point

to be on a proper show I don't know, I'm fine with this.

262
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,330
Unless we can...

263
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,910
Unless we can, like, have him start mugging, I guess.

264
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,650
Start mewing.

265
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,210

00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,060
I think that's fine.

277
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,820
And then, aging.

278
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,640
We've all seen some shit, guys.

279
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,040

Honestly, I think we're done.

287
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,860
I don't think I need to do.

288
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,160

Holy shit.

340
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,820
I was not expecting that.

341
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,940
Oh my god, we could be a Geisha.

342
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,080
Oh my god, we could be Dora.

343

00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,300
I can't do any of that.

350
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,180

00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,260
Dora.

00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,900

370
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,560
No way.

371
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:53,620
Glossiness.

372
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,140
There you go.

373
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,660
And then...

374
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,840
Oh, we gotta have nail polish, though.

375
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,980
We have to.

376
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,720
I think black would look great on you guys.

377
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,380
And then, oh my god, tone.

378
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,280
Yes, absolutely.

379
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,420
Alright, facial marking.

380
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,020
No, it's fine.

381
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,120
Alright, there you go.

382
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,580
And then, voice.

383
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,060
Am I supposed to know what he says?

384
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,280
Oh.

385
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,520
All right, there you go.

386
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,880
All right, I think we're good.

387
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,440
All right.

388
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,540
Finalize.

389
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,580
Welcome, Dora the Dragoon.

390
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,120
You shall be my chosen one.

391
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:46,900
Finalize.

392
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,420
Yes!

393
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,540
Dora the Dragoon.

394
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,690
You shall be my chosen representative.

395
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,370
You shall be my champion.

396
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,230
My tribute.

397
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,950
And then I hide the mirror again because I'm like, I'm so
ugly.

398
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,030
You're not ugly, daughter.

399
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,490
You're beautiful.

400
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:12,730
Look at you.

401
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,530
Don't hide the mirror.

402
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,350
Accept who you are.

403
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,970
That's the end of the cut.

404
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,870
No case.

405
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,970
X-Factor.

406
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,750
Thank you for the super chat.

00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:25,190
Thank you.

Thank you.

409
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,470
Let's go.

410
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,550
All right.

411
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:29,750
All right.

412
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,350
Let's head to the dojo.

413
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,130
Objectives will appear as white marks on the compass at the
top right of the screen.

414
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,750
The variant of the compass can be set in the basic game
settings.

415
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:42,990
I fell in.

416
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,610
Thank you for that five gifted ships.

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:44,990
Thank you.

418
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,630
Thank you.

419
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,390
All right.

420
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,930
It looks like he'd yell at me at Chai in his skill.

421
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,250
Thank you.

422
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:52,850

424
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,650

it back here dual swords sword i assume that dual sword

428
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:36,310

sword would be like super slow but we'll try it out any

429
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:43,990
weapon will serve you in battles so long i feel like it
first focus on choosing something that you feel comfortable

430
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:53,330
all right let's try the normal sword oh is odachi a very
long katana choose carefully i don't know i feel like the

431
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,410
basic would just be regular sort Oh, that is a long ass.

432
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,490
Oh, it's like a giant sword.

433
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,150
I don't know.

434
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,930
I love dual swords in general in, like, these types of
games.

435
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,970
But their damage is so weak in general.

436
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,890
So I don't know if it's worth it.

437
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,130
Oh, shit.

438
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,990
Okay, that strong attack looks sick as hell.

439
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,110
Yeah.

440
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,750
All right, what is the...

441
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,290
Oh, I think I'm going to do it.

442
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:25,730
I'm going to go do it.

443
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,510
dual sword first.

444
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,330
We're opponents.

445
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,230
Balance and easy to use.

446
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,390
Alright, we're gonna try a dual sword.

447
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:33,770
Check the spear?

448
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,730
I fucking hate spears, but I'll check it.

449
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,730
I don't like using spears in general.

450
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:45,430
Like, I never liked spears as weapons.

451
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,410
Yeah, it's spears pretty strong.

452
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:50,770
Alright, here we go.

453
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,450
I'm ready.

454
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:53,690
Yes.

455
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,310
So that's the weapon you've chosen?

456
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,550
I would like to use my dual sword.

457
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,030
Yes!

458
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,030
I don't want to go slashy, slashy, but multiple slashes.

459
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,230
Then I'll choose this one.

460
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,810
I swear to God, this is like Pokemon where he chooses the
one that counters me.

461
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:13,970
I swear to fucking God.

462
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,370
This is why you never pick first.

463
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,310
You just counter pick the other.

464
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,570
Let us begin the bout.

465
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,290
Bout to each other.

466
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,350
Oh.

467
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:27,810
Gesture R1 and to open the gesture.

your attention to lord come on and then oh lock on oh all

What are you doing?

475
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,770
Performing a key pulse after an attack.

476
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,030
Allows you to quickly recover key.

477
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:19,870
All right.

478
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,450
Before a key pulse on a tower, recover a portion.

479
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,530
After performing, press R1 as blue lights scatter around
you?

480
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,090
Oh!

481
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,470

The more you attack.

491
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,220
No, they give it a super chat.

492
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,060
Thank you.

493
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,180
It was my birthday yesterday.

494
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,980
And I was wondering if I could get a happy birthday for my
favorite yellow bird.

495
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,500
Please, because it's pronounced like worry.

496
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,260
Of course.

Happy birthday to you.

Happy belated birthday to it.

502
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,740
Happy birthday to you.

00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,020
Yay!

504
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,160
Happy birthday!

505
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,500
Alright, how do I do this now?

506
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,460
I'm gonna get so overwhelmed.

507
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,500
Oh, is it more so like, I got learned now?

508
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,340
And then...

509
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:51,920
Oh, okay.

510
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,610
That's looking right.

511
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,550
What you gonna do?

512
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,030
Nothing!

513
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,690
Okay.

514
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,410
Oh my god, you're so bad at this game.

515
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,510
You're like, you're the head of the house?

516
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,930
Look at you.

517
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,470
Slash, slash, slash!

518
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,450
Wait.

519
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,790
Why did I hit everything?

520
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:18,370
Okay, there you go.

521
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,330
Hold your skills in battle.

522
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,410
Unleash martial arts.

523
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,010
And then follow attacks with key pulses.

524
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,770
Alright, the controller seems simple enough.

525
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:37,110
I assume like, I feel like I have to upgrade it, like, so is
like, where I have to put it on stamina and shit.

526
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:43,050
Yeah, I gotta make sure my stamina is getting fucked over.

527
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,490
You mean today?

528
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,390

529
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,090
Look at that.

530
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,090
Like, come on.

531
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,650
Like, come on.

Fight back!

533
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,490
Oh my god, this is embarrassing now.

534
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,290
Can't even get a simpler hit.

535
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,110
Oh, like, come on, bro.

536
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:04,890
Oh my god.

537
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,430

Oh, shit.

542
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,360
Of course, the moment I beat the lord, he loses his castle.

543
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,420
Oh, that's bad.

544
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,760
Oh, what the fuck?

545
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,320
Come on.

546
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,760
We did it, Patrick.

547
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,000
We saved the city.

548
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,360
That's odd.

549
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,960
My village is on fire.

550
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,280
Oh, my God.

able to block that fucking hammer why are you still here the

556
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:29,520
oh never mind it's okay i just manifested a story it's fine
I don't think he knows that.

557
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,500
I'm a gamer.

558
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,420
Where do I go?

559
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,620
I guess this way.

560
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,280
That's where the death and destruction was.

561
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,160
So we go straight to that.

562
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,880
Oh wait, there's an item there.

563
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,260
Alright.

564
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,980
She's dead, so it's okay.

565
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,760
How could something like this come to pass?

566
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,620
On the day your new shogun was to be chosen.

567
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:51,980
Hello.

568
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,460
You must remain vigilant.

569
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,520
It's alright, I'll watch.

570
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,220
You act?

571
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:58,880
It's okay.

572
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,880
I can... Oh, nice.

573
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,480
Appreciate it.

574
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,660
Alright, it's okay.

575
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,020
Don't worry, I got the final blow!

576
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,100
Alright, enemy are born.

577
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,700
Human to your recovery speed is greatly while in the yokai
realm.

578
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,180
Successfully executing will cleanse and dispel.

579
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:16,840
Okay.

580
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,580
That seems easy, you know.

581
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,330
There we go.

582
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,050
Oh, shit!

583
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:25,890
That's a lot of them.

584
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,070
Okay.

585
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:33,890
Oh my god, these enemies definitely reminded me of Onimusha
in general

586
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:41,090
Yeah, oh shit it's a hit

587
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:49,690
Successfully blocked All right, slash

588
00:34:54,470 --> 00:35:00,170
Hey guys, hey guys, I'm aggroing them help help I'm doing my

00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:22,030
I hope I block that All right, nice Oh, I finish it Press
triangle When the enemies is out of chi Okay, there you go.

593
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:22,790
Am I finishing?

594
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:29,450
Oh, that's my familiar Bad tick

595
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,850
Oh, that's cool.

596
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:40,470
I just have to, like, know when they have a...

597
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,370
When the chi is...

598
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,270
When your chi is, like, low.

599
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,590
So beautiful.

600
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,770
I keep actually pressing R1 instead of, swear.

601
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,730
Because of, Elden Ring.

602
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,350
It's because of, like, souls.

603
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,130
I was like, R1, R1!

604
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,110
Like, why am I not hitting him?

605
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,090
At once.

606
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:11,510
My father, Sekishusai, split a massive rock that a Tengu had
transformed into.

607
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,050
This episode of Dora Explorer is a little strange.

608
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:16,030
Now it's my turn!

609
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,050
Jesus Christ.

610
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:21,970
He did that with katana.

611
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,810
There's a well up ahead.

612
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,390
Just past the inner gate.

613
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,030
From there, you can escape underground.

614
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:28,670
Alright.

615
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:32,410
It is my duty to protect you from the yokai.

616
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:43,790
fret not i'll be along as soon as i'm done i see my thanks i

00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:51,450

618
00:36:51,450 --> 00:37:04,550
like he's definitely dead dead oh and he gave me his
familiar yeah i borrowed it Oh, no.

619
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,950
I don't think he's coming back, guys.

620
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,410
He gave me his pet dog.

621
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,650
That's never a good sign.

622
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:18,870
He was like, don't worry, you're just borrowing my dog.

623
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,070
What's this?

624
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,730
Recover your life?

625
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,070
However you return.

626
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:25,550
Oh, okay.

627
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,450
So this is our bonfire.

628
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,510
By a prey?

629
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,040
So all the enemies have respawned.

630
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,640
The yokai have already made it this far.

631
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,160
The castle doesn't stand a chance.

632
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,560
Don't worry, parts of the castle are still there.

633
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,780
I keep pressing circle to pick this up.

634
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,180
Nice thought we finally created a peaceful world.

635
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,340
Was it nothing more than a fleeting dream?

636
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:12,400
oh wait they're just fighting each other oh wait no that's
my teammate I was like oh wait why are the yokai fighting

637
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:21,840
each other I was like oh shit sorry that's just my teammate
he looked like a yokai I couldn't tell he was camouflage

638
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:37,200
with the ninja gear all right nice even us ninja have been
pushed to the very brink no one can tell what the future

639
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,240
will hold for us.

640
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,380
Let's go over some of the ninja techniques.

641
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,480
Don't worry, they'll make a Neo 4.

642
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,220
Don't worry.

643
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,940
I know everything will be fine because I know they'll make a
Neo 4.

644
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,780
Use shift style.

645
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,020
Focus on direct mint and aims to dish out greater damage.

646
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,900
Focus on jelly combined with hit and run.

647
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,580
Wait, what is the ninja style?

648
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,180
Wait, I have to use my fist.

649
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,120
Wait, why would this be better?

650
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,460
Doesn't look like you have a weapon.

651
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:14,600
for a ninja yeah i guess there's no way around it get a
weapon from one of my fallen men around here let me know uh

this because This is from Inuyasha.

654
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,380
I know this from Inuyasha.

655
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,900
From the...

656
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,680
From the little brother that keeps dying.

657
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,320
Is that the weapon you'd like?

658
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:48,800
Yes.

659
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,220
Alright.

660
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,320
Get ready.

661
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,800
Yo-Kaiya.

662
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,240
Use the ninja's swift movements to confuse your opponent.

663
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,180
Oh yeah, I'm so fast in this one.

664
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:02,940
Oh shit!

665
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:03,420
Oh.

666
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,020
Using mist for intact?

667
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,120
Well, oh yeah, Kohaku, yeah!

668
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,580
I'm literally Kohaku right now.

669
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,840
Oh my god, there's a lot.

670
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,280
I'm a little confused.

671
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,340
Okay.

672
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,360
Alright, I'm gonna use my swing.

673
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,580
Oh, I do not have a lot of stamina though.

674
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,480
Oh, shit!

675
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,160
Nice.

676
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,200
Oh, finish it!

677
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,120
That's right.

678
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,220
Get finished.

679
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,080
Oh, fuck, there's more.

680
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,720
Okay.

681
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,240
I think, like, I don't recover the thing here.

682
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,040
R1 Triangle Square.

683
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,300
What?

684
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,440
Oh, shit.

685
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:00,820
Okay.

686
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:01,940
Okay, okay.

687
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,140
I'm in just doing right now.

688
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,540
What the fuck am I doing?

689
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,380
Oh my god.

690
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,260
How the fuck did I do that?

691
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,100
What?

692
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,260
How come I can't do the...

693
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,080
Wait, I'm trying to do the...

694
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,620
The fireball!

695
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,520
Oh, I don't have any more.

696
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,220
Unfortunately, I don't have any more.

697
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,540
I used it all up.

698
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,260
attack is also vulnerable.

699
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,020
Use that opening to your advantage and counter-attack.

700
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Okay.

701
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,520
How about counter-attack?

702
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,420
Oh, shit!

703
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,720
Now is the time for records.

704
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,940
Okay, like, you could have explained that before!

705
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,880
Oh, my!

706
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,380
Okay.

707
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,540
Alright, that's fine.

708
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:02,920
It's fine.

709
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,420
I'm learning.

710
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:03,980
I'm learning.

711
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,240
They didn't teach me to heal yet, guys.

712
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,440
I don't know how to heal.

713
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,020
Oh my god, I have to redo this.

714
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,840
Well, now I know how to play.

715
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,400
It's okay, it's okay.

716
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,200
I figured it out.

717
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,440
Alright, here we go.

718
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,540
Sorry, I figured it out.

719
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,860
Where is my... Alright, here we go.

720
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,020
Get ready.

721
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,280
Oh my god.

722
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,300
It's okay.

723
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,020
It's okay.

724
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,520
I figured it out.

725
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,620
Oh, it's like a little dodge shit.

726
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,080
Like after I attack.

727
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,440
If I time it correctly.

728
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,180
I don't know if I like the ninja move.

729
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:01,940
Not gonna lie.

730
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:08,040
I'm not a huge fan of the ninja form in general.

731
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,320
I think I like the...

732
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,340
I personally like the samurai form more.

733
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,300
Papa!

734
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,520
of your ninjutsu too.

735
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,160
Keep your distance from enemies.

736
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,080
Fireball!

737
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:18,800
Fireball!

738
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:34,040
Yeah, I assume I'll definitely get used to it, but I
personally, at this time, I definitely like, uh...

739
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:43,010
I definitely like, uh...

740
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:46,950
Okay, this is fine.

741
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:49,890
There we go.

742
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:50,430
Fireball!

743
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,790
Jesus Christ, how much HP do you have?

744
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:54,790
Fireball!

745
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:56,590
Fireball!

746
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:08,240
All right, there you go An enemy unleashing a powerful
attack Is also vulnerable Oh, fuck

747
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:17,320
Okay, you haven't done it yet Boom, I didn't time it

748
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:28,300
Okay, holy fuck Okay, this is I heal

749
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:40,340
Jesus Jesus Christ Okay, did I swap it correctly?

750
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:47,760
Swap!

751
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,840
Oh my god, I'm trying!

752
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:50,840
Oh!

753
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,180
Get up!

754
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:57,170
Oh!

755
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,690
What the fuck?

756
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:05,090
Oh my god, I did it.

757
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:05,570
I did it.

758
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:06,130
I timed it.

759
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:06,610
Okay.

760
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:07,290
I figured it out.

761
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:08,130
I figured it out.

762
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:11,410
I figured it out I figured it out.

763
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,490
It only took me a bit.

764
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:15,430
It took me a while.

765
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:16,090
Swap.

766
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:16,670
There you go.

767
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:17,510
There you go.

768
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:17,950
There you go.

769
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:21,170
And I have fireball and I have fireball and I have fireball
and I have fireball.

770
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:22,570
Okay.

771
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,380
Fireball, please.

772
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:33,940
Okay.

773
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,140
Okay, we figured it out.

774
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,280
It just took me three.

775
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:46,800
heels it just took me three all right never mind this game
is a lot harder next okay the scheme is actually a lot

776
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:58,620
harder than i thought i'm getting used to the controls very
slowly i sense the a bit messy but i got it was just a

777
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:06,940
little bit messy i figured it out you won't be able to stop
the yokai in that state least of all on your own i will

778
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:19,120
remain here and defend the castle with you taketio will be
fine alone have trust in your lord but there is no time to

779
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:28,920
debate the matter where is my food here i'll go lower the
ladder my polka my polka is here all right i deserve a

780
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,310
burger after that music i'm gonna grab my burger

781
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:11,240
so far my personal opinion about this game is that the
combat feels weird.

782
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,960
It's, I guess it's like how Neo is supposed to be played,
but it, it's, it is a little complicated and it feels a

783
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,700
little weird.

784
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,840
No, it's outside my door.

785
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,640
My PC is next, it's next to the door.

786
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,720
My PC room is next to my apartment door.

787
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,780
As they got up, open the door, grab the burger.

788
00:47:48,210 --> 00:48:04,060
hmm don't worry it gets more okay I didn't I think what
throws me off is the the cheap pulses shit don't forget the

789
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:20,260
ninja skills you have learned that throws me off a lot stop
talking cat oh shit how many furries are coming with me i

790
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:29,220
brought another guy guys i don't have enough food for all of
you guys do not worry about how so he has survived many

791
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:40,320
battles even without my aid is there like oh god oh god is
there okay there's a shrine thank god i was gonna save am i

792
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:46,200
like a zoo now like caretaker i'm gonna use the samurai i
like the samurai more

793
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:53,470
All right.

794
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:55,630
Slam dunk.

795
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,390
It's very fast-paced, though.

796
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,270
Why don't you dive right in?

797
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:06,890
Why does this sound so evil?

798
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:10,490
I thought we were, like, good friends.

799
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:12,110
Oh, my God.

800
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:17,190
Oh, my God.

801
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:18,410
Oh, my God.

802
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:18,850
Okay.

803
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:23,730
All right, we did it.

804
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:24,730
We did it.

805
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:25,390
It's all right.

806
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,130
Nothing to worry about.

807
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,750
Just a little flesh wound.

808
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,030
It's because he's British.

809
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,160
It's just... The combat is... It feels so weird.

810
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,520
I'm not used to this combat.

811
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,920
Spirit stones unleashed a terrible conflict upon this
country.

812
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,080
We mustn't allow them to be used.

813
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:50,760
Ever.

814
00:49:52,380 --> 00:50:12,360

Holy fuck.

820
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:05,400
Okay.

821
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:12,620
I don't think oh I don't think we're living this guys

822
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:23,840
Maybe it's scripted oh, yeah guys it was guys I it was
scripted I lost as fast as I could because I knew it was

823
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,020
scripted and it wasn't worth it guys

824
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,020
Let's finish this already

825
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,580
You wish to become Shokun that badly.

826
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:46,940
Go!

827
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,160
Oh no, lady, I just met.

828
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:56,760
Are you okay?

829
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,200
Maybe you don't want it enough.

830
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,560
What makes a Shokun anyway?

831
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,900
Lady, I don't even know where she came from.

832
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,020
What?

833
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:12,920
You can't answer.

834
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:18,250
You'll never answer.

835
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:24,030

samurai oh my god okay but then she looks pretty cute though

838
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:21,450
but i think i prefer a samurai more i shall follow the way
of samurai has changed yeah you're up too your wishes seem

839
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:30,490
to have brought out kusanagi's power you may have an innate
talent for connecting with guardian spirits and drawing out

840
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:34,450
their power Okay.

841
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:36,790
Need the area.

842
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:39,170
So is he stronger now?

843
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:44,410
So I have porn for Kusunagi and leave this place.

844
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:45,870
Yes.

845
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:47,930
What a curious place.

846
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:52,530
Perhaps we will have cause to return sometime.

847
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:56,720
Alright.

848
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,020
Leave the area.

849
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:09,170
I feel like a Pokemon trainer right now.

00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,340
I have a feeling he's not a good guy.

855
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:07,220
I've already cut off that curse escape route.

856
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,840
After him.

You're so beautiful, Adora.

863

Alright.

864
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,420
Those pennants bore the symbol of the Takeda army.

865
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,000
But they were defeated long ago.

866
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:40,640
Oh, what?

867
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,120
It's time traveled?

868
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,020
What a sinister light.

869
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,840
Kunimatsu was shrouded in the same glow.

870
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,200
Okay, so now I've time traveled.

871
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,660
I'm back in the past.

872
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:11,930
okay we'll grab this can I do anything I must be able to
upgrade stuff later oh look at the top hat equipment

873
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:19,570

be selected via equipment press R3 to automatically select

874
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:29,290
equipment oh wait I pre-purchased the most expensive one so
that means do I have pay to win No!

875
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:33,250
Where's my pay to win loot?

876
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:38,390
I, to be, I did not.

877
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:40,050
I should have read, like, what it gave me.

878
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:41,070
Oh, there you go.

879
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:44,010
Fire damage reduction.

880
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:49,390
It's normally...

881
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:50,790
Oh, gotta grab it from the shrine.

882
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:51,590
Oh, okay.

883
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:54,250
So right now, they don't give it to me yet.

884
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:55,810
What else is here?

885
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:57,130
Memories.

886
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:58,510
Okay, that's just a tutorial.

887
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,270
And this is my mission.

888
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:02,810
Alright.

889
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,800
Do I have any?

890
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,140
Okay.

891
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,080
Yeah, probably later.

892
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:12,020
That appears to be the Tokugawa banner.

893
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:17,160
It seems we've been whisked away to somewhere else again.

894
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,640
I can't make sense of this.

895
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,780
Let us continue for now.

896
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,180
Wait, what?

897
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,180
All right, watch this.

898
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,280
Oh my god.

899
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:36,680
Oh, I hope this man did not have a family.

900
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,460
Holy shit.

901
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,480
Okay, that...

902
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,180
Wow.

903
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,040
Okay, that's a little bit too far.

904
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,440
I didn't even do that to the demons.

905
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,520
He's like...

906
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,540
No way, I might be able to do a sneak attack.

907
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:53,860
Yeah.

908
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,920
I had a feeling that it was like a tutorial for sneak
attack.

909
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:02,180
That's a nice backstab.

910
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,380
It's just the wind.

911
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:10,800
A very strong wind.

912
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,060
Oh, man.

913
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,080
So windy today.

914
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:17,840
Oh, shit.

915
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:19,540
Oh, oh, it's okay.

916
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:20,360
All right.

917
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,650
I got him.

918
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,540
Wind never changes.

919
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,680
I don't want to go this way.

920
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,600
There seems to be extra loot here.

921
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,520
This water is crazy.

922
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,300
Almost sounds like someone's dying.

923
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:47,420
Wait, what?

924
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,000
Oh, wait, there you go.

925
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,080
God damn it, I keep pressing the circle.

926
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:53,800
Oh.

927
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:56,740
Oh.

928
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,940
There's like new loot.

929
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,100
How's that?

930
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:07,580
Uh...

931
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,960
Under T, thank you for the raid.

932
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:09,960
Oh, you had a great stream.

933
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:10,320
Thank you.

934
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,000
Thank you.

935
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,900
I mean, it has more damage.

936
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,500
More damage means...

937
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:19,780
Oh!

938
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,060
More...

939
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,400
More numbers equals more damage.

940
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,120
Alright.

941
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:32,040
Alright.

942
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,560
All right, what do you have?

943
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:36,980
Water.

944
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:38,940
Oh, shit.

945
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:39,540
Wait, there's more.

946
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,380
I didn't even see this.

947
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:43,220
Okay.

948
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,560
What did I grab?

949
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,960
Wait, is this a long sword?

950
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,680
That's what the odachi is, right?

951
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,340
All right, fuck that.

952
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:02,620
I don't like how slow that one is.

953
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:10,840
I'm gonna keep these two I don't like how slow this be like
the odachi weapon is so I'm just gonna go back to the dual

954
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:27,440
sword a clash between the Tokugawa and Decade of forces oh
shit I can hardly believe it it's unfathom babom

955
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:33,960
Fireball!

956
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,820
I should have saved my fireball.

957
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,660
What the fuck?

958
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:43,340
Oh my God, I thought I blocked it.

959
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,920
He just grabbed me.

960
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,300
Okay, I legit thought I could block that.

961
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,560
It's like...

962
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,100
It's not expecting that.

963
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:53,860
Wait.

964
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:58,320
I mean, defense is lower, so I feel like it should...

965
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:58,820
Alright.

966
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,600
Or he command grabbed me.

967
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,160
Does he know?

968
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:08,980
Oh, oh.

969
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,180
No one?

970
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:11,620
Just a little...

971
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:12,300
Whoa!

972
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:14,600
Okay.

973
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,240
That's right!

974
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,620
Samurai form!

975
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:20,460
Alright.

976
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,240
Thought I was just a little ninja.

977
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:24,960
Surprise!

978
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,180
Match the samurai.

979
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,320
Okay, this way is the right way.

980
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,780
Oh, no, he's got a spear.

981
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:37,360
What the fuck?

982
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:38,220
I can jump.

983
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:44,220
I was like, what?

984
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,780
He'll never expect this.

985
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:53,060
A single arrow to the head will kill most anything.

986
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:53,640
Oh.

987
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:54,900
Oh, I've got arrows.

988
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,220
R2 while holding L2.

989
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:00,920
Okay.

990
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,140
Do I already have it equipped?

991
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:03,740
I do.

992
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,020
Okay.

993
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:09,240
Hold L2, then press R2.

994
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:14,260
I swear to God, there's falloff.

995
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:15,660
What?

996
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:18,540
Okay.

997
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,140
What the fuck did I hit?

998
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,680
Where did the arrow go?

999
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:31,070
Where the fuck did the arrow go?

1000
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,880
I liked how you looked at me.

1001
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:38,700
He's like, what the fuck?

1002
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:40,080

1006
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:11,280
Oh, shit!

1007
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,300
You're still alive!

1008
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,900
I'll grab that.

1009
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,600
Okay, now I can go back.

1010
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,760
And that win is crazy.

1011
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:28,830
Whoops.

1012
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:31,910
Where I can lead this.

1013
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:33,430
I told you.

1014
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,790
I can lead that shot.

1015
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,260
Oh my god, okay, it's fine.

1016
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:47,960
It's fine.

1017
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:48,560
He doesn't know!

1018
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,460
Look at that.

1019
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:50,320
That's right.

1020
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,200
What you gotta do?

1021
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:52,920
Oh, that's looking right.

1022
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,040
Get back down those stairs.

1023
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,420
I'm gonna climb up.

1024
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,220
Fucking easy.

1025
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:02,720
But he's still alive.

1026
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,900
Alright, just one more hit.

1027
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,740
He should be dead soon.

1028
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:09,720
Flatter is mine.

1029
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,840
He's king of the hill.

1030
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:12,460
Alright, nice.

1031
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:15,500
Oops.

1032
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,760
Oh, so much loot now from that?

1033
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,080
I don't want to use the sphere.

1034
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:25,140
Ooh.

1035
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:26,360
I don't understand.

1036
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,640
Like, sort by level.

1037
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:30,540
There we go.

1038
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:31,960
Wait, which one did I equip?

1039
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:34,440
Oh, this one.

1040
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:34,760
Okay.

1041
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:37,000
I was going to say, I feel like level would be best.

1042
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:42,120
That damn right I have the hot ground.

1043
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,600
There's throwing stones.

1044
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,920
Guys are easy.

1045
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,080
There are too many of them without reinforcements.

1046
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:55,800
We're done for Okay, I see the shrine over there.

1047
01:04:55,860 --> 01:05:00,520
I shouldn't pray though I feel like if I pray

1048
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:05,740
What the fuck

1049
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:14,020
You're in that fucking nerve been in that corner Oh

1050
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:22,920
Oh, no, that guy's a bad man.

1051
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,800
Oh, that was a very bad man.

1052
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:31,760
Oh, I don't think he was looting, guys.

1053
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,320
I don't think that was looting.

1054
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,260
Spirit Stone.

1055
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,680
Grants 500.

1056
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:44,140
Oh, throwing stones.

1057
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,520
It's a rock.

1058
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:47,220
This?

1059
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:49,760
What does that do?

1060
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:50,640
Oh, like, look.

1061
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:59,210
Alright, I assume that way is the way to go for progress.

1062
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:03,250
I'm just gonna check if there's anything interesting back
here.

1063
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:11,520
Watch this.

1064
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,120
That's right.

1065
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:18,360
Your FPS VTuber right here.

1066
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,880
She still got it.

1067
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:22,320
She still got it.

1068
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:23,400
Damn!

1069
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:29,100
That's what, and that's how you lead your shots.

1070
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,240
Wait, what is that?

1071
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,880
Oh, I thought that was a person.

1072
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,080
She still got it.

1073
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,020
Not washed yet.

1074
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,560
Just like my simulations.

1075
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,280
I opened this chest.

1076
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:55,560
Oh my god, look at all this free loot.

1077
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,900
That people were just leaving behind.

1078
01:06:58,900 --> 01:06:59,960
All by itself.

1079
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,420
out here and there was just no one there and they just left
all this free loot for me.

1080
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:10,580
I don't think there is anything on top.

1081
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:12,800
I'm pretty sure.

1082
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,440
I don't see anything on the roofs.

1083
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:18,040
Oh, blue loot?

1084
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:20,460
Alright.

1085
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,480
Oh, shit.

1086
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:22,500
Blue loot!

1087
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:29,860
Okay, weight is heavier, but I think I can still have...

1088
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:30,940
I can still take it.

1089
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,960
I want to keep my current, the duels thing.

1090
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,220
Okay, 75?

1091
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:48,500
Fuck it.

1092
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,900
That's a normal sword, right?

1093
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:52,980
Is that the normal katana?

1094
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,280
Okay, normal katana.

1095
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:06,850
Alright, here we go.

1096
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:09,730
Okay, and then...

1097
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:12,750
This is stronger.

1098
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,150
I have this equipped already.

1099
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:20,530
All right, am I over how much weight?

1100
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:22,510
Okay, I still have enough.

1101
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:25,450
Nice, I'm still pretty fast.

1102
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:30,370
Yeah, I keep pressing circle.

1103
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:31,490
God damn it.

1104
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:31,910
Okay.

1105
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:39,490
So keep pressing circle.

1106
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:41,610
I don't think I need to pray, though.

1107
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:44,090
Because, like, um...

1108
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:47,490

1109
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:48,810

1192
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:03,590
Offering an Ochiko Cup at, or some and forth.

1193
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:04,430
Oh!

1194
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:08,650
Our life-defeating enemies will diminish the battle spoils.

1195
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:10,190
Okay, this is a call of friend.

1196

Fight for me.

1200
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:29,790

there's anyone to fight right now.

1201
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:33,990
I sort of already killed them, so I don't know.

1202
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:37,490
It's really pointless here.

1203
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:39,150
I guess we just lose.

1204
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:43,790
I'll pray a little bit too.

1205
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:48,510
Some invisitor has been unlocked.

1206
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:51,890
This feature enables you to request help from select co-op
and the shrine.

1207
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:52,350

1238
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:22,800
And I got gum jobs.

1239
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:27,680
Hulu has live sports and gum jobs.

1240
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,600
Oh, yeah, the Olympics are going on right now.

1241
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:30,680
All right, fight him.

1242
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,280
She left.

1243
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,960
She took my cup and left.

1244
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:59,020
what do you mean I swear to God if you leave gum jobs I
swear gum jobs fight them fight them yeah go gum jobs go I

1245
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:10,720

crazy now they only delivered a message that's

1247
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:27,460
insane.

1248
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:34,380
Unsubscribing from who adds them speed.

1249
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:44,380
Alright, I hope he's watching a sick-ass cutscene with me.

1250
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:50,800
Oh, that's cutscene of sick, though.

1251
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:57,790
I was just knocking.

1252
01:19:57,810 --> 01:20:06,050
expecting her to like take a sip from my fucking drink and
then just left be like sick thanks for the free alcohol I

1253
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:16,770
feel like I was actually at a club bought her a drink and
then she left didn't even want to talk to me

1254
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:50,240
dare defy me Yamagata the mightiest of takeda's crimson army
I don't think I know you.

1255
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,120
Oh shit.

1256
01:20:56,020 --> 01:21:00,620
But I just, I don't know, my fucking familiar fucking time
travel with me.

1257
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:01,300
Alright, gum jobs.

1258
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:03,940
Go gum jobs, go!

1259
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,040
Oh my god, I have that too.

1260
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:07,780
Watch this.

1261
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,240
Wait, that's my samurai.

1262
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:10,400
Baba!

1263
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:11,140
Baba!

1264
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,160
Baba!

1265
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:13,920
Ninja star!

1266
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:14,500
Ninja star!

1267
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:15,000
Ninja star!

1268
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:15,540
Ninja star!

1269
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:17,760
I'm helping!

1270
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:18,420
I'm helping!

1271
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:20,880
Okay, and now I don't have...

1272
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,080
Okay, you aggro him!

1273
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:24,960
You aggro him!

1274
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,300
And then I help!

1275
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:27,800
Boom!

1276
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:28,680
There you go!

1277
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:29,420
Look at that!

1278
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,360
Alright, we do that again!

1279
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:33,000
Okay.

1280
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:35,300
Alright, your turn!

1281
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:37,380
Oh shit!

1282
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:38,380
That's fine.

1283
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:40,440
Alright, you do your job?

1284
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:45,000
Alright, that's good.

1285
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:45,340
That's good.

1286
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:46,100
You're aggro him?

1287
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:49,660
Oh, nice.

1288
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,340
Finish her.

1289
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:52,860
Teamwork.

1290
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:53,600
All right, your turn.

1291
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:53,960
Your turn.

1292
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:54,300
Your turn.

1293
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,040
Your turn.

1294
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:00,380
Summon Kusanagi?

1295
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:01,900
What the fuck?

1296
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,240
Summon Kusanagi?

1297
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:06,080
What is he doing?

1298
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,120
I'm still...

1299
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:08,920
Oh, fuck.

1300
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:09,560
Oh, my god.

1301
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:10,520
Let the beast...

1302
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:11,400
I let the beast out.

1303
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:12,760
That's right.

1304
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:16,820
I'll let the beast out.

1305
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:36,170

retainer of tokugawa oh it removes you when you beat a boss

1308
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:24,660
oh i see i was gonna say tokugawa that's that could you to
think one you only wanted me for my boss, Luke.

1309
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,360
Oh, there's his persona.

1310
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,880
Um, your persona's trying to touch me.

1311
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:35,820
Sir?

1312
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:40,970
Takeda Shingen.

1313
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:44,890
The peerless tiger of Kai.

1314
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:48,310
Don't call it that.

1315
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:50,990
Has finally aired his facts.

1316
01:23:51,890 --> 01:23:53,610
It's his exposition persona.

1317
01:23:55,710 --> 01:24:04,350
Yo-Kai have joined with the Red Horde and are mercilessly
crushing the Tokugawa army.

1318
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:08,670
The fans are relentless.

1319
01:24:09,570 --> 01:24:13,310
Also, for those who played a demo, has it been different
from the demo?

1320
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:14,750
Or just the same?

1321
01:24:14,990 --> 01:24:19,530
The Red Horde's target goes without saying, Lord Yayas.

1322
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:29,970
Since we were boys, We have fought countless battles in the
name of peace.

1323
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:35,130
I will do anything to protect my lord.

1324
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:39,270
It looks exactly the same.

1325
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:40,950
God damn it.

1326
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,890
I took the gamma.

1327
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:50,250
Could have streamed at five.

1328
01:24:53,210 --> 01:24:55,130
I fell for it again.

1329
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:02,570
Lorde Asus, Hamamatsu Castle lies ahead.

1330
01:25:02,850 --> 01:25:05,950
Mm-hmm.

1331
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:14,260
No one pursues us.

1332
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:19,880
But you are able to kill Yo-Kai.

1333
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:22,040
Might you lend us your strength?

1334
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:28,260
Also, I would be very freaked out if I see a guy in that
armor.

1335
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:32,740
I'd be like, sir, your armor is fucking glowing.

1336
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:35,840
You are not a normal person.

1337
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,460
I wish you a safe journey.

1338
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:45,760
Like, sir, why is your armor glowing blue?

1339
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,740
Great military ambitions.

1340
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:53,820
A sword, emmy, and constant thorn in the side in Obonaga.

1341
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:58,640
Lumi for Historia de Japan.

1342
01:25:59,460 --> 01:25:59,860
Oh!

1343
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:01,200
I know the Obonaga.

1344
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:03,400
He's from Onimusha.

1345
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:17,100
yeah oh my god i fucking stole his persona i stole another
persona why do i keep taking people's personas sharing my

1346
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:23,620
lord's childhood name is quite the coincidence i have been
tasked with holding this position until my lord reaches

1347
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:34,360
hamamatsu castle join him and assist him in whatever way
possible it's like the pokemon coliseum i threw a shadow

1348
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:34,720
well.

1349
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:38,980
Not only, but other helpful information, such as location of
shrines and graves.

1350
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:40,620
Alright, that's cool.

1351
01:26:47,430 --> 01:26:48,190
Alright, oh, I knew it.

1352
01:26:48,190 --> 01:26:49,590
I knew there was something over here.

1353
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:51,150
There was, like, a little corner.

1354
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:56,730
There's, like, you know, classic map design.

1355
01:26:59,730 --> 01:27:01,690
I'm going to my OC now.

1356
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:03,930
Alright, map to view.

1357
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:04,550
Okay.

1358
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:09,190
This is not a very informative I'm sorry.

1359
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:13,830
This map looks so hard to look at.

1360
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:17,630
Ooh.

1361
01:27:18,030 --> 01:27:18,410
Okay, wait.

1362
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:18,890
Oh, wait.

1363
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:20,350
Actually, that's 41.

1364
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:22,810
This is still stronger.

1365
01:27:22,930 --> 01:27:24,570
I mean, it is gold, though.

1366
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:29,760
Iron Switchclav?

1367
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:31,780
What the fuck is this?

1368
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:35,560
Holy shit.

1369
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:36,520
Wait, this shit is...

1370
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,500
Wait, I should like this.

1371
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:39,880
This is...

1372
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:54,420
blue is better than yellow the fuck since when wait blue is
better than yellow but it's gold what that does not make

1373
01:27:54,420 --> 01:28:00,940
that that rarity does not make sense i'm sorry like excuse
me when did when did blue became better than yellow

1374
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:12,960
all right 68 base defense up

1375
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:20,500
It's white, yellow, blue, purple, green is the...

1376
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,440
Oh my god.

1377
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:24,780
Wait, is green actually the best?

1378
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,780
Okay, story by...

1379
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:32,760
Level.

1380
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:38,520
Oh my, this is like backwards rarity.

1381
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:39,800
This makes my brain hurt.

1382
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:42,980
It's like actual backwards day rarity.

1383
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:50,760
Great, hello.

1384
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:51,520
I'm out.

1385
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:52,660
That's fine.

1386
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:54,560
It's fine.

1387
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:56,760
But now I'm so...

1388
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,580
I'm so strong now.

1389
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:03,900
Okay, so blue is better, but then this has more defense.

1390
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,200
Okay, and then I'll swap that.

1391
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,500
Because this is level 8, so it should be better.

1392
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:27,560
And then we'll grab the Crimson Lombow here.

1393
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:35,400
Oh!

1394
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:38,480
No, I think our current thing is better.

1395
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:41,540
Okay.

1396
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:50,780
oh my god i don't think i like the cat he's quite good i
think i know why the other get the master the old master

1397
01:29:50,780 --> 01:29:58,460
that gave him to me he didn't want to follow him to the
afterlife you knew what was gonna happen and that's why he's

1398
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:12,380
like i can't have this cat follow me to my death the cat is
a little annoying he's like a little navi this game is so

1399
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:18,340
backwards for rarity it's like it goes everything I've ever
learned about rarity colors.

1400
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:23,060
The fact that green is the rarest is fucking with my head
right now.

1401
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:25,200
I'm like, green is common!

1402
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:29,340
Green has always been common!

1403
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:31,380
What do you mean green is high?

1404
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:45,820
You can change the colors.

1405
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:46,500
Oh, thank God.

1406
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:47,040
That's good.

1407
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:48,960
That's good that you can't change the colors.

1408
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,340
That actually makes no sense to me.

1409
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:05,320
The fact that gold is below blue and green is the rears

1410
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:22,920
oh shit oh i fucking finished a tutorial guys does anyone
else see like hands coming up from the sky that grotesque

1411
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:34,040
creature blotting out the sky it resembles the one we saw in
edo and there's hamamatsu castle beside it i am not Fond of

1412
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:45,580
the idea, but I suppose we ought to take a closer look at
what they go towards the sky The fucking hands coming over

1413
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:46,540
in the sky.

1414
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:51,120
All right A lot of dead bodies.

1415
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:58,380
It's not a good side If there's a lot of dead bodies, that
means there's something that killed all these people

1416
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:14,100
point she is devoted to holding my skills with the blade
only to die without passing martial arts under my acquired

That's parry.

1423
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,660
I've been getting really good at parrying.

1424
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:09,080
In general.

1425
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,020
In God of War.

1426
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,420
If you think about it.

1427
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:16,440
Okay.

1428
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:19,320
This is fine.

1429
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,220
I'm not overwhelmed at all, guys.

1430
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:24,760
I'm not overwhelmed at all.

1431
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:25,580
This is fine.

1432
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:27,920
Alright, let's pray here.

1433
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:30,820
You may now fast travel.

1434
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:31,360
Oh, okay.

1435
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:33,260
We can finally fast travel, too.

1436
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,660
Yeah, this game has skill trees.

1437
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:41,300
And which allows you to progress with other players have
been...

1438
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:41,700
Oh!

1439
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:47,660
Alright, what should we get next, chat?

1440
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:49,740
I get skill, right?

1441
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,800
I should do skills because it helps.

1442
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,660
Wait, what does it do?

1443
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:55,820
Melee, attack, range...

1444
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:59,200
Yeah, I'll do skill because it helps with, like...

1445
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:02,300
guardian spirit.

1446
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:03,220
All right.

1447
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,380
I stole someone else's persona again.

1448
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:07,020
I'm going to keep with my current.

1449
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:08,460
I'm just going to keep with this one.

1450
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:09,260
All right.

1451
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,820
So now I

1452
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:18,420
what?

1453
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:24,800
What did I do?

1454
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:28,080
Well, let's create a room.

1455
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:29,440
Private.

1456
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:29,980
You know what?

1457
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,120
Let's explore together.

1458
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,040
Let's figure this out together, guys.

1459
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:34,280
All right.

1460
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:36,260
Draft.

1461
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:36,520
Oh.

1462
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:39,380
How do I set up my Oh, six-digit code.

1463
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:41,960
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1464
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:42,460
All right.

1465
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:42,960
Surely.

1466
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:44,780
There we go.

1467
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:48,620
Sure, why not?

1468
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,420
Let's figure this game out together.

1469
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:55,620
Let's...

1470
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:56,340
Fuck it.

1471
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:58,140
We might as well.

1472
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:01,540
All right.

1473
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:05,060
Where are my dragons at?

1474
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,920
The most complicated password of all time.

1475
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:09,600
We even have an enemy right here.

1476
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:12,320
It's like Pokemans, for real.

1477
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,140
It's so secret.

1478
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,880
All right, let me...

1479
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:20,680
I'll go...

1480
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:23,720
I'll go stretch this guy up real quick.

1481
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:27,860
All right, I'll wait.

1482
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:33,500
Don't worry, the password is very easy.

1483
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:34,580
It's 1 to 6.

1484
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,080
No prep.

1485
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:38,600
Yay!

1486
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:39,780
Yay, Yager Storm!

1487
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:41,880
Let's go!

1489
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:48,340
Damn, you dressed like that?

1490
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:51,300
You dressed like that for war?

01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:52,820
Alright, go in there.

I got a rare item, but I don't know where it's from.

Okay, not gonna lie, it feels very monster hunter-y now that
I fucking invited people into my lobby.

01:51:51,330 --> 01:51:52,190
Alright, nice.

1762
01:51:52,430 --> 01:51:53,410
Where else do we go?

1763
01:51:54,110 --> 01:51:55,470
This is very open world.

1764
01:51:56,630 --> 01:51:57,350
Oh, shit.

1765
01:51:57,590 --> 01:51:58,330
How did I...

1766
01:52:01,370 --> 01:52:01,850
Alright.

1767
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:04,150
Nice.

1768
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:06,630
Okay, I definitely need a heal, though.

1769
01:52:09,470 --> 01:52:10,870
It's full dog.

1770
01:52:10,970 --> 01:52:12,850
You cannot stop the furry.

1771
01:52:14,650 --> 01:52:16,750
It's very open world, for sure.

1772
01:52:16,810 --> 01:52:18,110
Because I don't know where to go.

1773
01:52:18,150 --> 01:52:20,650
I'm just going where my heart takes me.

1774
01:52:22,190 --> 01:52:37,770
but I gotta pray real quick here pray oh purified soul how
do I purify it oh I need to do all of that stuff to purify

1775
01:52:37,770 --> 01:52:44,490
it you have a soul core that can be set in your oh my god
there's still more stuff to learn there's so many things to

1776
01:52:44,490 --> 01:52:45,350
learn in this game.

1777
01:52:49,790 --> 01:52:51,530
I'm just going to balance everything out.

1778
01:52:51,750 --> 01:52:55,710
I'm way too confused on how to do my management for this.

1779
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:00,840
Alright.

1780
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:03,580
Should be good.

1781
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:07,560
Do I need to do I need to put anything new on?

1782
01:53:08,780 --> 01:53:11,020
There must be a store where I can sell all of this.

1783
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:13,520
Like, I have too much stuff on my inventory.

1784
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:17,700
There must be a place to of my items.

1785
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:20,500
There's just way too much shit right now.

1786
01:53:22,180 --> 01:53:22,660
Later on?

1787
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:23,800
Okay, that's good to know.

1788
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:26,080
Alright, where do we go, guys?

1789
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:29,260
You know what?

1790
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,320
Where's my compass say?

1791
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:33,880
Alright, let's go over to the castle.

1792
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:36,220
I'm heading straight there.

1793
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:39,740
We don't even need a B here.

1794
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:41,660
Alright, this is the door.

1795
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:44,540
Let's head to the objective, guys.

1796
01:53:45,660 --> 01:53:46,360
Oh, hey, look.

1797
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:47,980
Oh shit.

1798
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:48,560
Hello.

1799
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:50,680
That's awkward.

1800
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:53,460
That's right.

1801
01:53:54,180 --> 01:53:55,140
We picked the wrong place!

1802
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:57,760
That's looking right!

1803
01:53:59,220 --> 01:54:01,380
We picked the wrong place to drop down!

1804
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:03,860
I can't even see what's going on!

1805
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:09,460
That's right, we hugged you!

1806
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:16,640
Oh my god, there is literally...

1807
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:18,980
I don't think they scaled this.

1808
01:54:19,540 --> 01:54:22,520
I legitimately do not think they scaled the enemies.

1809
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:30,640
They seem like the same HP as you were in your solo right
now.

1810
01:54:32,780 --> 01:54:34,560
Yeah, they can't even fight back.

1811
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:35,800
Ah, guys.

1812
01:54:35,860 --> 01:54:36,300
Come on.

1813
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:37,220
Come with me.

1814
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:41,100
Just a little oversight.

1815
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:44,700
You picked the wrong house.

1816
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:46,640
I have two friends.

1817
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:56,100
like hell itself damn that shingen

1818
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:04,580

Okay, I'll sell these then.

1837
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:25,940

Alright.

1839
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:29,080

Sell all.

1841
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:30,560
Yes.

1842
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:39,710
Oh, hope I didn't fuck up.

1843
01:58:42,730 --> 01:58:45,390
Hope I didn't fuck up there.

1844
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:51,880
Alright, here you go.

1845
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:55,740

01:58:57,580 --> 01:58:58,600
It's fine, right?

1848
01:59:01,020 --> 01:59:02,400
Yes, yes.

Exchange.

Alright, let's go.

1853
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:13,540
I finished talking to the evil baby.

1854
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:14,660
Let's go in.

1855
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:20,340
Alright, let's enter the crucible, guys.

1856
01:59:28,810 --> 01:59:29,130
Okay.

1857
01:59:30,090 --> 01:59:32,390
It seems a lot friendlier inside.

1858
01:59:33,150 --> 01:59:33,810
Oh, I get to pray.

1859
01:59:35,790 --> 01:59:37,470
Oh, this is the new shrine.

1860
01:59:37,810 --> 01:59:38,070
Okay.

1861
01:59:39,290 --> 01:59:42,030
This is what the new shrine looks like inside the...

1862
01:59:42,030 --> 01:59:45,470
I will say this place looks friendlier inside than outside.

1863
01:59:45,770 --> 01:59:47,030
The outside was pretty scary.

1864
01:59:47,310 --> 01:59:48,530
It looked pretty dangerous.

1865
01:59:50,910 --> 02:00:05,490
from the crucible I've never seen a loki like it before this
seemed too bad there's a lot of loot here a lot of loot here

1866
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:18,390

Never had someone hit me back before.

1884
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:18,500
Alright, guys, guys.

1885
02:02:19,900 --> 02:02:21,140
We gotta let our wolves out.

1886
02:02:22,300 --> 02:02:23,040
Let our first show now.

1887
02:02:23,180 --> 02:02:23,380

1888
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:24,180

Guys, are you guys ready?

1890
02:02:27,220 --> 02:02:28,320
Brent, come over here.

1891
02:02:29,060 --> 02:02:29,260
Alright.

1892
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:32,220
The moment I do this, we let the beast out.

1893
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:38,700
Let the beast out!

1894
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:42,640
That's right!

1895
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:44,800
Get him!

1896
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:46,320
Alright, he's dead.

1897
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:48,360
Alright, that was pretty easy.

1898
02:02:53,660 --> 02:02:54,780
We did it.

1899
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:56,520
Alright, well, oh my god.

1900
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:57,680
Look at all this loot, though.

1901
02:02:59,100 --> 02:02:59,680
He died.

1902
02:02:59,860 --> 02:03:01,100
Jump that dude.

1903
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:03,600
He died so quickly.

1904
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:05,900
I told you.

1905
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:08,040
They definitely did not...

1906
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:10,740
They did not scale the enemies at all.

1907
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:18,920
And you literally just, if you have three, if you have two
friends, you can literally just zoom past every enemy.

1908
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:26,000
I refuse to believe they scaled the enemies.

1909
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:29,720
But now I'm just fucking casually walking past people.

1910
02:03:34,350 --> 02:03:36,690
The average souls game.

1911
02:03:39,410 --> 02:03:40,090
Oh my god.

1912
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:41,430
It's going crazy.

1913
02:03:42,770 --> 02:03:43,670
Alright, you guys ready?

1914
02:03:44,430 --> 02:03:45,230
Alright, round two.

1915
02:03:46,290 --> 02:03:47,330
Round two, guys.

1916
02:03:47,530 --> 02:03:47,850

1917
02:03:47,990 --> 02:03:48,750

02:03:54,870 --> 02:03:55,630
He's so stupid.

1922
02:03:57,350 --> 02:03:58,130
Look at him.

1923
02:03:59,090 --> 02:03:59,690
Imagine burning.

1924
02:03:59,790 --> 02:04:00,290
That's right.

1925
02:04:00,370 --> 02:04:00,830
Get him!

1926
02:04:02,510 --> 02:04:03,470
Get him!

1927
02:04:03,470 --> 02:04:04,270
Get him!

1928
02:04:06,270 --> 02:04:07,790
Imagine burning to death.

1929
02:04:07,970 --> 02:04:09,010
Couldn't be me.

1930
02:04:09,810 --> 02:04:11,510
Couldn't be me.

1931
02:04:17,030 --> 02:04:18,270
All right.

1932

All right.

1933
02:04:20,550 --> 02:04:21,430
Oh, you see that?

1934
02:04:21,530 --> 02:04:24,510
Okay, I still got hit, but like it was pretty cool though.

1935
02:04:25,790 --> 02:04:25,810
Wait.

1936
02:04:32,490 --> 02:04:32,570

1943
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:47,000
How did this happen?

1944
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:48,760
How did this?

1945
02:04:49,180 --> 02:04:50,300

1946
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:54,020

Who let this happen?

1950
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:07,840
I don't understand.

1951
02:05:08,940 --> 02:05:11,280
I thought we were invincible, guys.

1952
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:16,010
Alright.

1953
02:05:17,550 --> 02:05:18,250
That's right.

1954
02:05:18,270 --> 02:05:18,850
I'm so angry.

1955
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:19,270

1956
02:05:23,620 --> 02:05:24,060
Alright, nice.

1957
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:27,260
Alright, I'm gonna take my anger out of this one guy.

1958
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:28,240
Get over here, guys.

1959
02:05:29,140 --> 02:05:31,460
We gotta take our anger out of this one man.

1960
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:32,380
That's right!

1961
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:35,020

02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:42,240
Alright, let's just zoom past.

1965
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:42,940
Let's go.

1966
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:51,980
Now that we know, we can walk past... Okay, I actually I
don't know about this guy.

1967
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:53,420
I think we can walk past him.

1968
02:05:53,800 --> 02:05:54,700
Okay, give me a sec.

1969
02:05:55,120 --> 02:05:55,780

1971
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:03,500
That's right!

1972
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:05,780
If we all keep hitting him, he can't...

1973
02:06:05,780 --> 02:06:07,280
He can't do any damage!

1974
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:10,780
Okay, nice.

1975
02:06:11,720 --> 02:06:12,300
All right.

Let's go.

1977
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:15,720
I think it was...

1978
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:18,180
Wait, which way was it?

1979
02:06:18,180 --> 02:06:19,020

02:06:19,140 --> 02:06:20,500

02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:22,000
How to get over there?

1982
02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:23,320
Alright, it's this way.

02:06:25,580 --> 02:06:26,600

02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:49,480

02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:51,220

2043
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:12,880

02:09:14,180 --> 02:09:15,620
Oh, oh, thank God.

2045
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:17,700
We actually needed this so badly.

2046
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:22,780
Alright, uh, strength.

2047
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:24,720
Oh, wait.

2048
02:09:25,220 --> 02:09:25,660
Strength.

2049
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:28,020
I'll just balance everything out.

2050
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:29,300
And I'll...

2051
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:33,000
All right, I'm level 10 now.

2052
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:36,060
Isn't that this way?

2053
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:40,120
Wait, which way would it be?

2054
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:43,500
I feel like it wouldn't be that way.

2055
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:48,840
Is it really that way?

2056
02:09:48,860 --> 02:09:51,380
I feel like it'd be in the creepy house over here.

2057
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:52,660
I trust Jaeger.

2058
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:56,140
This feels more like Endgame.

2059
02:10:00,890 --> 02:10:02,170
Oh my god!

2060
02:10:03,690 --> 02:10:04,610
Thank God.

2061
02:10:05,390 --> 02:10:05,950
Not me.

2062
02:10:06,910 --> 02:10:07,210
Oh my god.

2063
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:07,590
What is he?

2064
02:10:07,630 --> 02:10:11,750
He's glowing red That's the color of evil

2065
02:10:16,830 --> 02:10:18,670
Is this way

2066
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:32,970
My god, this fucking mosquitoes sinking fucking oh, oh,
that's a big guy I knocked I thought he was just part of the

2067
02:10:32,970 --> 02:10:39,410
background Oh, if we're such a big guy, he seems very weak.

2068
02:10:40,030 --> 02:10:41,790
Like, the mosquito has more HP.

2069
02:10:44,110 --> 02:10:45,210
I fucking...

2070
02:10:45,210 --> 02:10:45,810
Okay, it's okay.

2071
02:10:46,730 --> 02:10:47,190
I'm okay.

2072
02:10:50,490 --> 02:10:52,290
This feels like...

2073
02:10:52,290 --> 02:10:54,230
Okay, I will say...

2074
02:10:55,410 --> 02:10:56,530
The looting...

2075
02:10:56,530 --> 02:11:00,010
The looting for this game reminds me of Diablo.

2076
02:11:05,910 --> 02:11:06,830
That was...

2077
02:11:06,830 --> 02:11:08,810
I realize that's what it reminds me of.

2078
02:11:11,010 --> 02:11:15,930
It feels very Diablo-esque with how the looting works in
here.

2079
02:11:19,150 --> 02:11:26,610
Yeah, it's like Diablo, Monster Hunter, and Sword of
Souls-like when you're playing solo.

2080
02:11:28,650 --> 02:11:33,870
When you're playing solo, like when you're playing solo, I
guess it's Souls-like.

2081
02:11:34,190 --> 02:11:37,850
But then when you're playing with a group, it's just Monster
Hunter.

2082
02:11:40,510 --> 02:11:42,310
I want to enable auto-pick.

2083
02:11:43,410 --> 02:11:44,910
It's very annoying.

2084
02:11:45,950 --> 02:11:46,690
Well, I'm going to try that.

2085
02:11:46,750 --> 02:11:47,430
Where is it?

2086
02:11:51,430 --> 02:11:51,990
System.

2087
02:11:54,290 --> 02:11:54,850
Controls?

2088
02:11:57,640 --> 02:11:58,560
Six settings.

2089
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:00,700
Where is it in the...

2090
02:12:00,700 --> 02:12:01,500
Where is it?

2091
02:12:01,620 --> 02:12:02,800
Is it in accessibility?

2092
02:12:08,910 --> 02:12:09,950
Game settings?

2093
02:12:10,410 --> 02:12:10,690
Okay.

2094
02:12:12,210 --> 02:12:13,090
Let's play it live.

2095
02:12:14,590 --> 02:12:16,750
Skip cutscenes, subtitles

2096
02:12:22,700 --> 02:12:30,740
Pick up over a drop Item, okay, there you go Yeah, I need
auto pickup I'm getting tired of Picking it up myself Like a

2097
02:12:30,740 --> 02:12:41,320

pickup?

2098
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:50,440

02:12:56,940 --> 02:12:58,220

Okay, he's doing a lot of damage now.

2101
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:02,720
I feel like I might need a...

2102
02:13:03,560 --> 02:13:07,340
I might actually change my loadout now.

2103
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:11,040
Alright, give me a sec.

2104
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:14,380
I have not changed my armor in a very long time.

2105
02:13:14,700 --> 02:13:17,860
I feel like my items are now a lot stronger.

2106
02:13:18,240 --> 02:13:19,240
Oh, shit.

2107
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:20,380

That'll be fine.

2116
02:14:17,410 --> 02:14:18,390
Oh, this happens a lot.

2117
02:14:18,710 --> 02:14:22,390
I thought it would be a little bit bigger just because of
the damage in this blade.

2118
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:27,480
Alright, watch this.

2119

02:16:46,280 --> 02:16:47,260
We can do it.

2155

02:19:06,750 --> 02:19:07,290
Oh, my God.

2188
02:19:07,370 --> 02:19:08,410

02:20:13,390 --> 02:20:14,750
We gotta get the loot.

2208
02:20:15,310 --> 02:20:18,130
This would be so hard, so low.

2209
02:20:19,910 --> 02:20:21,250
Guys, come on.

2210
02:20:21,550 --> 02:20:23,250
To celebrate, everyone.

Don't trust it We did it guys we did okay.

2229
02:21:18,030 --> 02:21:24,690
It actually is crazy how different of a game it is come I
wanted to know How different the game is when you have

2230
02:21:24,690 --> 02:21:27,350
people just You would think it's skills, right?

2231
02:21:27,470 --> 02:21:30,590
Like, I know I keep saying that, but...

2232
02:21:30,590 --> 02:21:32,350
It's like an entire new...

2233
02:21:32,350 --> 02:21:34,410
It's an entirely different game.

2234
02:21:34,930 --> 02:21:36,930
It is very different.

2235
02:21:37,590 --> 02:21:37,950
Yeah.

2236
02:21:39,490 --> 02:21:41,930
It's no longer Souls-like.

2237
02:21:45,860 --> 02:21:46,820
I did it.

2238
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:49,100
I saved the world.

2239
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:53,660
I feel like I'm playing a hack and slash.

2240
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:57,200
I feel like I'm playing Monster Hunter slash hack.

2241
02:21:57,220 --> 02:22:00,400

really fun what you're playing with your friends for sure

2243
02:22:13,260 --> 02:22:25,580
the light future versus time yeah it's just three friends
just jumping random guys but our meeting also pretends the

2244
02:22:25,580 --> 02:22:46,720
revival of a great evil that's confronting together you want

2246
02:23:01,880 --> 02:23:04,940
continued to wield the benevolent blade

2247
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:22,280
Yet my blade and mind were nearly destroyed with the
darkness is revived The light that can sever fate

2248
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:37,860
Encountering the one who wields that sword has I feel like
I'm winning the joy once more I just beat up an old lady in

2249
02:23:37,860 --> 02:23:43,880
the corner Two of my friends that That ain't winning.

2250
02:24:00,440 --> 02:24:01,920
He's alive!

2251
02:24:02,540 --> 02:24:03,940
The battle rages yet.

2252
02:24:04,780 --> 02:24:07,740
Oh wait, no, it's time traveling so he has never died.

2253
02:24:08,660 --> 02:24:12,340
Wait, wait, this is some fucking paradox shit.

2254
02:24:13,780 --> 02:24:16,360
Intruding yokai have been dealt with.

2255
02:24:17,500 --> 02:24:18,240
Yeah, he's young.

2256
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:21,740
Well done, Panzo.

2257
02:24:22,580 --> 02:24:23,780
I have returned.

2258
02:24:26,220 --> 02:24:27,600
You are unharmed.

2259
02:24:29,180 --> 02:24:31,300
Oh, it's him younger, too.

2260
02:24:31,860 --> 02:24:33,440
Quite superb, Takachio.

2261
02:24:34,680 --> 02:24:37,160
You would bear the hollyhop crest well.

2262
02:24:42,910 --> 02:24:44,210
There is much to discuss.

2263
02:24:44,930 --> 02:24:45,890
May we speak en route?

2264
02:24:56,470 --> 02:24:57,770
Alright, arm.

2265
02:24:58,430 --> 02:24:59,370
Oh, wait, is there more lore?

2266
02:24:59,730 --> 02:25:00,670
I was going to grab water.

2267
02:25:02,690 --> 02:25:03,150
Takachio.

2268
02:25:03,530 --> 02:25:04,990
Oh my god, this feels...

2269
02:25:06,510 --> 02:25:08,210
Now listen well.

2270
02:25:08,470 --> 02:25:09,170
This feels like that.

2271
02:25:09,310 --> 02:25:11,110
Okay, now we're in Dynasty Warriors territory.

2272
02:25:11,110 --> 02:25:16,770
Our base of operations for the whole Totomi region is under
siege from the north and east.

2273
02:25:18,190 --> 02:25:19,830
Now we're back to Dynasty Warriors.

2274
02:25:20,050 --> 02:25:25,450
Takeda Shingen leads a massive force that has swiftly
surrounded our forces in several locations.

2275
02:25:28,110 --> 02:25:28,310
Shingen.

2276
02:25:28,830 --> 02:25:34,050
I knew of his tactical brilliance, but for Yokai to be under
his command.

2277
02:25:36,190 --> 02:25:46,930
allies are being herded to their own graves but for a
warrior idly awaiting death is to disgrace your name for

2278
02:25:46,930 --> 02:25:53,190
generations i never played samurai warriors i assume it's
the same as the dynasty warriors one who has survived for

2279
02:25:53,190 --> 02:26:03,070
japan it's based in japan versus jano the time to venture
forth and test fate is at hand i shall make for the keep and

2280
02:26:03,070 --> 02:26:09,070

with you.

2281
02:26:10,170 --> 02:26:10,750
Go to her.

2282
02:26:18,320 --> 02:26:24,860
All right, I ain't gotta pee and also grab water, so I'm
gonna be right back.

2283
02:26:25,160 --> 02:26:27,480
All right, all right, dragons, you two.

2284
02:26:28,540 --> 02:26:30,820
Red, digger, entertain my chat.

2285
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:31,960
I'll be right back.

2286
02:28:31,790 --> 02:28:33,950
So what are you guys doing, huh?

2287
02:28:35,170 --> 02:28:37,590
What, what, what are you guys doing, huh?

2288
02:28:38,450 --> 02:28:40,970
Oh, you're gonna run away now.

2289
02:28:41,250 --> 02:28:41,630
I see.

2290
02:28:45,350 --> 02:28:46,570
Oh, I see.

2291
02:28:47,230 --> 02:28:49,110
Oh, yeah, you're gonna run away.

2292
02:28:49,250 --> 02:28:51,150
You're gonna be scattered.

2293
02:28:53,770 --> 02:28:54,990
Waiting for... Oh, my!

2294
02:28:55,330 --> 02:28:59,570
You have the power to traverse time and purify the crucible.

2295
02:29:00,170 --> 02:29:03,430
There is something I must share with you.

2296
02:29:03,670 --> 02:29:04,030
Hello?

2297
02:29:04,470 --> 02:29:06,030
Well then, shall we go?

2298
02:29:06,410 --> 02:29:08,050
All right, what's she gonna share with me?

2299
02:29:09,190 --> 02:29:16,690
The dark radiance that summons the Crucible is known as
Crucianite.

2300
02:29:16,750 --> 02:29:22,630
And those who imbue their guardian spirit with Crucianite
become immortal by feeding on spirit stones.

2301
02:29:23,090 --> 02:29:26,770
If that was the same radiance you saw, that must mean...

2302
02:29:27,910 --> 02:29:28,450
He won.

2303
02:29:28,790 --> 02:29:32,650
The one who's gutted Crucianite throughout time is the
source of this calamity.

2304
02:29:33,090 --> 02:29:35,230
Destroying the Crucianite in different ages.

2305
02:29:36,590 --> 02:29:37,010
Should we...

2306
02:29:37,010 --> 02:29:37,930
There's a shrine here.

2307
02:29:41,250 --> 02:29:43,230
All right, let's pray real quick.

2308
02:29:43,630 --> 02:29:43,970
All right.

2309
02:29:45,310 --> 02:29:47,310
One so, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2310
02:29:47,590 --> 02:29:49,230
I'm going to call it here.

2311
02:29:50,210 --> 02:29:51,070
Because I'm tired.

2312
02:29:54,370 --> 02:29:57,030
Personal opinion, honestly.

2313
02:29:59,070 --> 02:30:02,790
Um, it is seems really, it seems really fun.

2314
02:30:03,470 --> 02:30:06,070
I had a lot of fun playing with you guys here.

2315
02:30:06,690 --> 02:30:17,570
Um, but it does make it a different game i will say um yeah
i you know i didn't i didn't do a nap before the stream i

2316
02:30:17,570 --> 02:30:22,470
was just i went straight i i just did behind the scenes work
and then waited until the game

2317
02:30:26,290 --> 02:30:36,630
but it feels i didn't mention it before for this game or
watch the back flip while i explain I feel like Um If you

2318
02:30:36,630 --> 02:30:44,070
actually want to souls like You play solo But you want to
like Fuck around You play with a group of friends Because I

2319
02:30:44,070 --> 02:30:52,190
wanted to see what it was like I was like Oh I can invite
multiplayer Because I feel like Definitely for sure Um Like

2320
02:30:52,190 --> 02:31:01,990
Like Dark Souls Slash Elden Ring multiplayer Is a lot harder
Is a lot harder Than Where the fuck Neo 3 multiplayer Was

2321
02:31:03,610 --> 02:31:10,110
Yeah, but you want like a more like if you want something
more harder for yourself You want more challenge you play it

2322
02:31:10,110 --> 02:31:18,250
solo, but like for this I felt like It I felt like I was
playing monster hunter when I had like three people when I

2323
02:31:18,250 --> 02:31:25,570
had two other people join me That was literally just like
we're just jumping on the bosses and then beating the shit

2324
02:31:25,570 --> 02:31:36,150
up Yeah, it just felt like I just, we just like, we saw a
target and we all just, like, bash this guy's head in, like,

2325
02:31:36,190 --> 02:31:37,530
all three of us.

2326
02:31:39,190 --> 02:31:42,750
Because, like, enemies does not feel like it's scaled at
all.

2327
02:31:44,910 --> 02:31:46,550
Will I do a part two on stream?

2328
02:31:46,970 --> 02:31:48,730
Most likely not.

2329
02:31:48,990 --> 02:31:59,050
I feel like for the stream, I might play it off stream, but
I don't think I would do a on stream because i feel like uh

2330
02:31:59,050 --> 02:32:12,670
i feel like it would be more like a repeat of the same thing
where i mean unless i do a solo of course but i i felt like

2331
02:32:12,670 --> 02:32:24,590
the combat system itself for me was there's a lot especially
the skill tree the skill tree was was a lot for me and i've

2332
02:32:24,590 --> 02:32:27,650
never i've played Path of Exile before.

2333
02:32:28,190 --> 02:32:31,590
So I'm like really bad with skill trees because I'm like, I
don't know what to do.

2334
02:32:31,650 --> 02:32:32,570
There's no meta yet.

2335
02:32:32,810 --> 02:32:34,130
I don't know what that meta is.

2336
02:32:35,910 --> 02:32:36,310
Absol.

2337
02:32:36,430 --> 02:32:37,830
Thank you for the five gift of ships.

2338
02:32:38,070 --> 02:32:38,170
Thank you.

2339
02:32:38,250 --> 02:32:38,850
Thank you.

2340
02:32:39,070 --> 02:32:43,650
I would definitely play this off stream or like maybe I'll
do it a Twitch stream of this for sure.

2341
02:32:44,710 --> 02:32:48,250
I will definitely do like maybe if I want to like play
something on Twitch.

2342
02:32:48,370 --> 02:32:50,170
Like I just want something like a throw not throw.

2343
02:32:50,390 --> 02:32:54,470
I won't say throwaway game but more so like a game where I
could just like play on stream.

2344
02:32:54,770 --> 02:33:00,010
Like not have to worry about having a schedule or anything I
didn't play this on Twitch or like if I just want to play

2345
02:33:00,010 --> 02:33:05,910
something or like play something with you guys as well like
I just invite two random dragons or just play it off stream

2346
02:33:05,910 --> 02:33:14,070
with some friends yeah it seems like it feels a very brain
off type of game for sure um because I was not using my

2347
02:33:14,070 --> 02:33:20,250
brain when I was doing like I was like oh wait I can't have
my weapon out on this game because I guess like there's a

2348
02:33:20,250 --> 02:33:30,490
lady here um there's a there's a there's a uh get my weapon
up but i felt like i was like square square triangle

2349
02:33:30,490 --> 02:33:47,410
triangle r1 square triangle r1 square square square it's
just great off hit monster uh but it is fun it is a fun game

2350
02:33:47,410 --> 02:33:53,730
how to say it is like it is a fun game especially with
friends if you want to challenge you obviously you play it

2351
02:33:53,730 --> 02:34:01,390
solo and i it's still like the beginning i heard like neo as
a game is like really fucking long too i know neo 2 was like

2352
02:34:01,390 --> 02:34:15,830
what 30 the 40 hours long and i assume neo 3 is just as long
if not more um but that's my that's my only that's my i

2353
02:34:15,830 --> 02:34:22,090
guess like that's my review of the game so far Will I play
NEO 1 or 2?

2354
02:34:23,590 --> 02:34:24,930
I'm not sure.

2355
02:34:25,630 --> 02:34:29,090
Now that I played 3, I'm not sure if I'll play...

2356
02:34:29,090 --> 02:34:33,290
I guess, like, I went in thinking it was more Souls-like, I
guess.

2357
02:34:33,890 --> 02:34:44,870
Um, so, like, I personally, for me, um, I definitely, if I
had to rate all the Souls-like games I played, um, I think,

2358
02:34:44,910 --> 02:34:54,690
like, this would be, like, out of all the Souls-like games I
played, far, I would put this at the bottom because I, like,

2359
02:34:54,830 --> 02:34:57,590
you know, I played like Elden Ring, I played Dark Souls and
all that.

2360
02:34:58,430 --> 02:35:03,830
I, and like, I really like Wukon style of Souls, like, yeah.

2361
02:35:05,950 --> 02:35:15,210
I would like, I definitely prefer Wukon more, and, uh, I
prefer Wukon more, and I prefer, like, Elden Ring slash Dark

2362
02:35:15,210 --> 02:35:17,690
Souls more, and, you know, I like Bloodborne and everything.

2363
02:35:18,190 --> 02:35:27,710
Yeah, Wukon was really really fucking good um it i guess
like i went in thinking was more souls like than what it was

2364
02:35:27,710 --> 02:35:39,150
actually so like um so it was like a little bit like a jumps
not jumpscare was the way it's a little bit like oh i was

2365
02:35:39,150 --> 02:35:54,350
not expecting this you know type deal definitely different
expectations um lot in Elden Ring I I did enjoy the gameplay

2366
02:35:54,350 --> 02:36:04,190
a lot but this one it was like mixed for me um it was a bit
mixed for me because there was just so much stuff you know

2367
02:36:04,190 --> 02:36:15,750
it was like there was like different styles ninja mode
samurai mode and then the buttons are very weird I will say

2368
02:36:15,750 --> 02:36:24,030
like because like square the fact that it's like square and
triangle and not like r1 it like threw me off a lot because

2369
02:36:24,030 --> 02:36:32,230
i was i kept r1ning at first because i i was so used to
r1ning in all my games um i played lies of p i had i i

2370
02:36:32,230 --> 02:36:49,200
didn't finish it only because it's so it's so hard oh you
can change but the thing is like even if i change it i it's

2371
02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:56,320
just gonna it would feel confusing because i have to do i
have to make sure i press r1 to restore my chi and it was

2372
02:36:56,320 --> 02:37:04,240
just it was definitely a lot to learn in general like not
like not begin i feel like for me it was it didn't feel like

2373
02:37:04,240 --> 02:37:09,160
super beginner friendly And, like, also, there's so many
particles.

2374
02:37:12,900 --> 02:37:19,660
There were so many particles that I couldn't keep track of
when to, like, block.

2375
02:37:22,200 --> 02:37:24,460
Yeah, it's a lot of us to get used to.

2376
02:37:24,840 --> 02:37:29,680
So, definitely, like, this game took me a while to figure
out.

2377
02:37:31,320 --> 02:37:36,100
And it is, I will say, like, if you enjoy these types of
games, games.

2378
02:37:36,500 --> 02:37:40,820
I feel like it will it is like I don't think it's a bad
game.

2379
02:37:41,340 --> 02:37:48,980
I just think like I just think like I think I went in with a
different expectation on what I thought this game was going

2380
02:37:48,980 --> 02:38:00,560
to be and um and like it felt more like monster hunter to me
rather than like what I initially thought and I'm really

2381
02:38:00,560 --> 02:38:09,620
sorry I'm not a very I like I think I told you guys this
before Like, I'm not, like, a very Monster Hunter player.

2382
02:38:12,660 --> 02:38:13,100
I...

2383
02:38:15,220 --> 02:38:18,300
Like, it's not my type of game type deal.

2384
02:38:18,380 --> 02:38:19,700
Like, my type of game genre.

2385
02:38:24,900 --> 02:38:25,340
Yeah.

2386
02:38:26,920 --> 02:38:29,240
But, yeah, that's my honest opinion on it.

2387
02:38:29,420 --> 02:38:29,940
If you like...

2388
02:38:29,940 --> 02:38:33,940
I think if you like Monster Hunter, you would like playing
this with friends in general.

2389
02:38:34,720 --> 02:38:37,200
And, like, I think, like, if I play the solo...

2390
02:38:38,660 --> 02:38:47,560
the fucking combat was fucking me up a lot the only reason
why I was like I'm gonna open this party up I'm gonna open

2391
02:38:47,560 --> 02:38:51,020
this party up because the combat was fucking me up and I was
like fuck this

2392
02:38:55,120 --> 02:39:06,220
I was just like I'm gonna open I'm gonna explore with the
dragons because the combat oh yeah the combat um N7 they

2393
02:39:06,220 --> 02:39:10,100
give me the super chat thank you thank you Nokia dragoons
have the zoomies.

2394
02:39:10,180 --> 02:39:10,800
Yeah, I don't know.

2395
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:19,080
I'm just letting them tire themselves out right now I'm just
letting that's what you do when they have the zoomies.

2396
02:39:19,240 --> 02:39:20,060
Just let them run.

2397
02:39:20,480 --> 02:39:22,800
Let them run around and tire themselves out.

2398
02:39:23,080 --> 02:39:26,920
But yeah, anyway, anyway, we do have two streams tomorrow.

2399
02:39:27,100 --> 02:39:31,160
I mean, one is just an announcement stream for the
tournament, which will be revealing the teammates and

2400
02:39:31,160 --> 02:39:31,660
everything.

2401
02:39:32,740 --> 02:39:34,600
Um, and the other one is a member stream with men in black.

2402
02:39:34,780 --> 02:39:42,120
So it's very chill announcement stream will be a
multi-stream so i'll be streaming on youtube and twitch
